1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,540
Here we go.
Three,

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,990
two,
one fucking year.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,850
Philippe.
How are you sir?

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,410
Was so full.
Good man.

5
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:12,540
You have to have him have to say that.
I don't know.

6
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,430
It seems like it has.
Like you said,

7
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:17,100
what's up dude?
And then you said what's up fool?

8
00:00:17,101 --> 00:00:19,650
You corrected yourself.
I'm slipping.

9
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,460
Was that like when you have such a cool 
saying like you do,

10
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,500
you almost feel compelled to use it?
Yeah,

11
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,920
it all started like people in my 
neighborhood would answer the phone like

12
00:00:28,921 --> 00:00:29,754
that.
I was dating this girl and I called her 

13
00:00:31,471 --> 00:00:33,780
up and her brother.
I sort of porn with self pool.

14
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,100
That's normal,
right?

15
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:36,780
Yeah.
That is a,

16
00:00:36,781 --> 00:00:39,170
a,
a cool Mexican thing to set.

17
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,920
No,
probably more like the hood.

18
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,610
More like the west coast Hoodie,
west coast hood.

19
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,370
That's not necessarily central Mexicans 
and blacks.

20
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:48,900
Like we took it from the blacks.

21
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:49,813
Oh,
okay.

22
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,090
But it mostly like a west coast,
south central east La Boyle Heights.

23
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,150
Boyle Heights in the house.
Yeah.

24
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,003
What?
That's,

25
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:00,063
you know,
this is a contentious time for fucking 

26
00:01:02,131 --> 00:01:04,810
people when it comes to like,
um,

27
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,710
Mexicans and Americans with this whole 
wall thing.

28
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,930
Yeah.
And I,

29
00:01:09,931 --> 00:01:11,550
I went to,
I went to go,

30
00:01:11,551 --> 00:01:12,384
um,
to look at the walls because they went 

31
00:01:13,621 --> 00:01:18,570
to Mexico and I was like right at the 
border of the gate,

32
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,540
like the gate,
it's not a wall to the gate.

33
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,650
And across the gate they have like eight
wall prototypes,

34
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,700
like the ones,
like eight wall prototype.

35
00:01:29,701 --> 00:01:34,510
Like there's one wall that's like a,
it's a wall was the man and it has um,

36
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,513
concrete.
Then there's another wall that's 

37
00:01:36,511 --> 00:01:38,010
different.
And then another one,

38
00:01:38,011 --> 00:01:39,360
it's like they have,
you know,

39
00:01:39,361 --> 00:01:41,280
when you,
when you go buy title for her house.

40
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,740
Yeah.
And they show you all the tiles.

41
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,630
Oh Wow.
The Hook.

42
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,760
What the wall is like little home depot.
Yes.

43
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,960
But like a sign,
like a placard with different.

44
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:52,980
Wow.
Look at that.

45
00:01:52,981 --> 00:01:53,700
That's it.
I was reading,

46
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,380
I was there.
I was right in front of that.

47
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,590
Each one of those,
I think it costs $25.

48
00:01:58,591 --> 00:02:01,780
Million each wall each.
Yeah.

49
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,470
What?
Someone's getting robbed.

50
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,060
This subcontractors right now in New 
Jersey going,

51
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:08,551
wait,
wait.

52
00:02:08,551 --> 00:02:09,141
Hey.
Hey,

53
00:02:09,141 --> 00:02:13,050
what the fuck?
I could do that for 30 grand.

54
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,470
Anytime you have a wall.
Historically.

55
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,570
Shit goes down,
right?

56
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,970
People want to get over that wall.
It's natural.

57
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,160
People want to get out,
people want to get out,

58
00:02:26,161 --> 00:02:26,994
but you want to get in going to be tall.
And here's what the craziest shit about 

59
00:02:30,991 --> 00:02:31,824
the wall.
I'm sure you've seen where it goes into 

60
00:02:33,091 --> 00:02:34,760
the ocean.
Yeah,

61
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:35,603
I was there.
Like how are you going to stop people 

62
00:02:37,801 --> 00:02:38,634
from going around that?
That is the silliest thing ever that is 

63
00:02:41,521 --> 00:02:46,521
like having this gigantic wall that is 
like having like a gigantic,

64
00:02:48,481 --> 00:02:49,314
huge impenetrable boundary.
But on one side there's just like a 

65
00:02:52,861 --> 00:02:54,240
door.
Yeah.

66
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,950
That's a door.
You go right around.

67
00:02:55,951 --> 00:02:59,710
That may be hard to bring all your shit.
So what happens?

68
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,203
These guys right there on the Mexico 
side and those guys over there on the 

69
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:08,260
California side like that is the 
weirdest shit ever.

70
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,290
Play volleyball with each other.
Do they really?

71
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:12,363
Wow.
The added another piece to that wall 

72
00:03:16,151 --> 00:03:18,190
right there.
So that was an old wall.

73
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,413
See that?
The construction of the wall that I saw 

74
00:03:21,071 --> 00:03:22,690
now.
Yeah.

75
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,700
Wow Man.
He can still swim.

76
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,950
But uh,
as soon as you swim,

77
00:03:26,951 --> 00:03:28,840
you know the part of the postcards and 
come get you.

78
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,760
That is so crazy.
Just what,

79
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,760
what a strange.
And people go,

80
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,860
you don't want a wall.
Relax.

81
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,350
I hadn't said any of that.
Not saying that.

82
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,460
I'm saying just look at this just as a,
use your brain.

83
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:44,043
Just look at this objectively and see 
how bizarre it is that there's a 

84
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:53,530
gigantic physical boundary to keep 
certain people from going into a certain

85
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:56,110
area.
I mean,

86
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:56,944
I,
I think that that one day that has to 

87
00:04:00,131 --> 00:04:01,840
not be a thing anymore.
Right?

88
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,703
Wouldn't you say

89
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:09,890
that is a crazy thing to justify?
Like you can't come to the good spots.

90
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,710
Like the good spots are limited.
Well,

91
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:12,603
if they,
we let people in and there'll be no 

92
00:04:13,491 --> 00:04:14,990
more,
no more good spot.

93
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,390
It'll be just like the bad spots.
That's the,

94
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,300
that's the fear.
And here's the thing,

95
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,620
man,
that ain't not uncommon.

96
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:24,830
That's not a,
it's not an imperfect.

97
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,040
It's not a fear that's not totally 
illogical either.

98
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:28,874
Right?
Like you would be worried if you lived 

99
00:04:30,621 --> 00:04:35,600
in a sweet place,
like a name of a city.

100
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,930
Not Too many people perfect size 
boulder,

101
00:04:38,931 --> 00:04:40,270
Colorado.
We have orders.

102
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,200
Cool.
Yeah.

103
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:46,640
Nice.
What if a million more people moved into

104
00:04:46,641 --> 00:04:47,474
boulder?

105
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:52,050
Now all of a sudden it's a million 
100,000.

106
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,230
You're like,
what the fuck?

107
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,780
What the fuck is this?
He can't go anywhere now.

108
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,480
Everybody's rude.
People start getting antsy.

109
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,760
That the way they drive that drive 
faster.

110
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,860
That's what happens.
Be More more gangs.

111
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,110
Why do you fix that?
That's how.

112
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,043
That's what we need to fix.
Not like whether or not there's a wall 

113
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,873
he fixed.
How do you fix people from getting 

114
00:05:12,251 --> 00:05:13,690
crazy?
I know man.

115
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,400
They shoot on later boulder,
Colorado Party.

116
00:05:16,401 --> 00:05:19,750
We'll have a subway system to get other 
people off the streets.

117
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,250
Yeah.
Yeah.

118
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:25,570
If they did,
if they did have a couple million people

119
00:05:25,571 --> 00:05:26,500
moved,
they're like,

120
00:05:26,501 --> 00:05:28,590
Bam,
start moving shit and sentence.

121
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:32,440
She would change radically.
That's what happens to places.

122
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,230
You get too many people.
They just fucking change.

123
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,760
It's a.
it's still strange.

124
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,940
Fuck.
See a wall.

125
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:45,800
It is to house.
I'm not saying that I can,

126
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:50,640
but it gets so big.
It's so right when he left with a bad.

127
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,090
What'd you just take two comedy?
Yeah.

128
00:05:53,091 --> 00:05:56,300
All I'm saying is it's weird.
It's fucking weird.

129
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,160
It seems

130
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,160
to be something that should be perhaps 
reexamined this idea of like,

131
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,303
it's almost like we have weird parents 
that we have to listen to for our whole 

132
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,990
life and that,
those parents with the government.

133
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:09,973
I know,
like when I was a little boy I would 

134
00:06:12,521 --> 00:06:15,590
live in Mexico and um,
my mother,

135
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:19,970
she to tie me up to a stump so,
so we'll run away.

136
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,223
Holy Shit.
That glaze to follow my dad to work 

137
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,020
every day.
My Dad was like a,

138
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,770
I think he was like a steel worker or 
something.

139
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:32,000
He worked on a lathe.
So he worked with metal at the time.

140
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,400
Yeah.
And I will follow him to,

141
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,710
to work everyday because I was a little 
kid I guess,

142
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,143
and they couldn't.
I will run away every day and my mom 

143
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:42,710
would tie me up to a little street store
with a rope.

144
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,990
I was her pet,
basically.

145
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:48,410
Jesus Christ.
Holy Shit.

146
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,400
That's a weird memory.
I know,

147
00:06:53,401 --> 00:06:55,570
right?
That I lived in.

148
00:06:55,571 --> 00:06:56,404
Um,
I remember I lived in Mexico for a 

149
00:06:57,481 --> 00:07:02,070
little while until I was three or four.
Then my dad took off.

150
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,610
Do you remember Mexico at all?
I remember a bathroom was outside

151
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:11,660
like an outhouse and we have to use a 
flashlight to go outside and wow.

152
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,613
I remember mosquitoes everywhere and my 
mom's family are living in like in one 

153
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:21,440
big ranch with different houses and it 
was fucking dusty.

154
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,553
I mean it was dusty.
I was living in Mexico and they used to 

155
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,064
be a truck that will water the ground 
everyday because it was too dusty and 

156
00:07:32,601 --> 00:07:33,434
there was no cement.
But then my dad took off to the United 

157
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:40,820
States and we followed him.
We came here.

158
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:45,320
We were living in Tijuana,
Mexico for about two years.

159
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,300
Do you remember how you get through?
Yeah,

160
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:50,630
we met with my dad,
made it through first,

161
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,230
started another family then came and got
us now.

162
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:57,740
But that's what I thought.
He was gone for a long time man.

163
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,250
And then we,
we went,

164
00:08:00,251 --> 00:08:01,084
we were living with my aunt,
her name was Julia and she lived in 

165
00:08:03,081 --> 00:08:04,190
Tijuana,
Mexico,

166
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,060
right next to that.

167
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:05,893
Where that,
where that gate is Polonia Tsa was up 

168
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,090
and um,
we,

169
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,430
we went across with a,
you know,

170
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,303
a smuggler.
My mom pay them money and we got in his 

171
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,120
car.
Wow.

172
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,080
We crossed and we made it through.
I remember we made it through,

173
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:24,710
but there was like a checkpoint back in 
the day in San Clemente,

174
00:08:24,711 --> 00:08:25,544
California.
The California Sheriff Department will 

175
00:08:27,711 --> 00:08:29,240
just,
the county sheriffs,

176
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,830
they will randomly stopped cars,
you know,

177
00:08:31,831 --> 00:08:34,550
like too many people in one car and his 
car too heavy.

178
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:39,500
So they got us and they put us in there 
like in a holding cell.

179
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,810
My mind went one way.
We went the other way.

180
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:44,120
Oh.
And how old were you?

181
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:49,270
I was probably four maybe or five.
I remember there are three,

182
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,713
three little brothers.
I have my little brother was like three 

183
00:08:53,261 --> 00:08:54,094
in the other one was one or two.
Why would they separate you from your 

184
00:08:57,061 --> 00:08:57,894
mom?

185
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:58,830
Um,
I don't know.

186
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,663
That's,
I guess that's how they process web 

187
00:09:01,121 --> 00:09:04,270
backs are illegal people.
That seems kind of crazy.

188
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:06,870
She went to one when,
I dunno what I'm,

189
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,093
I don't remember crying or being scared.
I just know that we're watching 

190
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:11,940
cartoons,
you know,

191
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,390
American cartoons,
that's all you remember.

192
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,840
And then they caught us.
We,

193
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,630
we,
we went back again and they cut it again

194
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,350
in another car and we got separated 
again.

195
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:29,220
But this time we were held for a longer 
time and I remember my aunt,

196
00:09:29,221 --> 00:09:31,410
when she saw us in Mexico,
she said,

197
00:09:31,411 --> 00:09:33,030
hi,
they catch you guys again.

198
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,120
Just jokingly.
Wow.

199
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,043
But the third time was like my,
my aunt and my mom came up with this 

200
00:09:40,261 --> 00:09:41,094
crazy idea because we have brothers.
We had cousins in Sunny California and 

201
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,870
my mom said,
you know,

202
00:09:48,871 --> 00:09:52,350
why don't we just borrow their 
passports,

203
00:09:52,351 --> 00:09:53,370
you know,
to cross.

204
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:55,203
And I don't remember this.
I just found out recently that what 

205
00:09:57,601 --> 00:09:59,040
happened,
my brother told me,

206
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,800
my little young brother,
um,

207
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:07,020
we just almost like a little girl,
like a full on little girl.

208
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:08,443
Um,
because at the we had like three 

209
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:10,734
passports and two were boys.
One was girl and we took straws to 

210
00:10:13,931 --> 00:10:14,764
guests and my mom and my aunt,
they forced my little brother to be a 

211
00:10:19,711 --> 00:10:21,780
little girl.
How they make him look like a girl,

212
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:22,763
they just,
my little girl for two weeks just to 

213
00:10:24,061 --> 00:10:25,170
play around,
you know,

214
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:28,410
they give them a fake name and so and 
so.

215
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,610
And he was playing dancing no more 
dancing,

216
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:34,770
getting ready,
playing with Barbie dolls.

217
00:10:34,771 --> 00:10:38,360
And so he was preparing,
preparing broke deniro,

218
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,270
bro.
Wow.

219
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:42,360
Getting ready for that row of his life.
Wow.

220
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,450
How old was he?
He was two at least,

221
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,810
or three man.
He was young.

222
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,680
Wow.
We crossed and we made it all the way.

223
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,990
And um,
I remember that um,

224
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,053
some other car picked us up.
We jumped into another car right away 

225
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,850
and then we jumped in another car and 
then that car drove us to,

226
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,080
to southern California.
We were lacking content somewhere.

227
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,760
And Carson,
we're in a house that had the.

228
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,850
It was,
it was funny,

229
00:11:18,851 --> 00:11:19,684
it was like a,
it was like a hub for illegal 

230
00:11:21,031 --> 00:11:23,670
immigrants.
Like everybody there was going different

231
00:11:23,671 --> 00:11:24,750
places.
Okay.

232
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:26,400
Who are you going to go to?
St Louis.

233
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,530
This guy,
you're going to go to San Diego.

234
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:30,150
That lady,
her three kids,

235
00:11:30,151 --> 00:11:32,610
they're going to go to boyle heights 
because that's where the father is.

236
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:36,780
So that were granted boyle heights,
um,

237
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,410
didn't speak no English at all.
But um,

238
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,840
I picked up English right away,
you know,

239
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,590
because your little like watching bionic
woman and Shit.

240
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,360
$6,000,000
man,

241
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:52,740
incredible hulk dukes of hazard.
So you basically picked it up from TV.

242
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,640
We'll be like,
what kind of,

243
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:02,830
what kind of lessons did you take?
Lessons were in English or none.

244
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:04,570
Zero.
When I was,

245
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:07,600
when I was in elementary school,
it was different from now.

246
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:08,434
There was no,
like separating these kids who don't 

247
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:14,530
speak Spanish have put them in an 
English as a second language class.

248
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,250
I started,
I started kindergarten,

249
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,230
so.
So you just picked it up?

250
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,330
I picked it up.
The teacher,

251
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:26,000
the teacher never spoke Spanish to us.
She never said I'm okay Hawaiian,

252
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,510
you know what apple is?
That it wasn't nothing like that.

253
00:12:28,511 --> 00:12:29,870
It was time.
It was like,

254
00:12:29,871 --> 00:12:32,200
I don't got time for you.
You're going to pick it up or not.

255
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,290
Do you think it was because you were.
You were so young.

256
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:38,800
Your brain could pick up another 
language really quickly.

257
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,780
Isn't that what they say?
Like young people,

258
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:45,640
their brains pick up languages quicker.
I think I picked it up really fast,

259
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:48,130
but to my pronunciation we're not there.
Right?

260
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:51,910
Like I didn't know how to stay bionic.
I will say in that kind of makes sense,

261
00:12:51,911 --> 00:12:52,744
right?
That a part of your brain would really 

262
00:12:54,521 --> 00:12:57,970
develop and make it real easy to learn a
language when it's real young,

263
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:58,871
you know,
like,

264
00:12:58,871 --> 00:13:00,250
okay,
how do I say this?

265
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,370
What do I give more of?
A desperation for figuring it out,

266
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,030
but I bet you a little kid that comes 
from another country like you did.

267
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,860
Well,
you're a perfect example.

268
00:13:08,861 --> 00:13:10,690
You learned from TV.
That's crazy.

269
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:12,783
So you learned from just talking to 
people that are around you and 

270
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,230
television,
television.

271
00:13:17,231 --> 00:13:20,890
Nobody's saying this is how you say this
is a pronoun,

272
00:13:20,891 --> 00:13:22,390
this is a Noun,
a verb.

273
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,450
Not telling you any of that.

274
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,333
Nobody told me that,
but later I had a cousin who lived in 

275
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:32,370
Santa Paula and she taught me that stuff
like,

276
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,300
this is how you say this word because 
her and I were playing.

277
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,270
We'll play like school together.
Yeah,

278
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:41,080
or she'll give me assignments that were 
just should pretend to be a teacher.

279
00:13:41,081 --> 00:13:42,730
Then a read.
You know what man?

280
00:13:42,731 --> 00:13:44,530
For little kids,
that should be fascinating.

281
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,053
Learning how to speak like,
but for whatever reason we decide that 

282
00:13:48,611 --> 00:13:50,970
it's boring.
Like learning a language.

283
00:13:50,971 --> 00:13:51,681
It's like,
ah,

284
00:13:51,681 --> 00:13:54,250
it's so much work.
I've got to read another book.

285
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:56,220
Fuck that.
Fuck,

286
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,410
fuck up another book report.
Give you now to come on man.

287
00:13:59,411 --> 00:14:01,070
Just get Rosetta stone.
I'm like,

288
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:06,640
imagine trying to learn Chinese.
Like what are you saying?

289
00:14:06,641 --> 00:14:10,790
I'm going to learn how to read it too.
I could read that stuff and and say,

290
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,020
oh,
how much time would that take?

291
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:16,560
That would be crazy.
I took German in high school at for like

292
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:21,370
a whole year and I did an eight class 
but I didn't learn anything.

293
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:22,451
See,
for me,

294
00:14:22,451 --> 00:14:25,450
I think everything gets super squirrely 
with,

295
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:28,360
with unusual,
like languages.

296
00:14:28,361 --> 00:14:32,290
They use things other than our letters.
As soon as you use things other than our

297
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:33,910
letters,
like you see Russia and you're like,

298
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,170
ah,
what?

299
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,960
What the fuck is that?
Shit?

300
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,493
They have totally different.
Like ways of using our letters pull up 

301
00:14:43,361 --> 00:14:47,410
some like Russian pull up like Russian 
translation,

302
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:50,790
like Russian tab.
There's they got wise in there and

303
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,780
yeah,
it's a champ.

304
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,673
It's such a powerful language.
It looks like almost like Viking runes 

305
00:14:59,001 --> 00:15:01,760
or something like that.
Sometimes like Braille.

306
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:05,030
That's a crazy,
crazy looking language like um,

307
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,970
another one is Arabic,
Arabic crazy.

308
00:15:07,971 --> 00:15:11,870
Look in language when they go to that.
What the hell is that man?

309
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,470
That's the way it is.
You'll see in the movie Indiana Jones.

310
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:21,040
What is that thing that looks like a,
like a spade with a knife through a tart

311
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:25,220
take right there.
Stay at the hotel,

312
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,013
right.
That like what does that call Krillick 

313
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,750
they call it Krillick.
Okay.

314
00:15:32,751 --> 00:15:34,340
Look at the language.
Like look at it.

315
00:15:34,341 --> 00:15:37,670
When you see it written down,
we'll get that weird double k thing.

316
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,360
K Left K,
e Dot k cave.

317
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,293
Look at that one.
They'll be folks here at crown to watch 

318
00:15:43,821 --> 00:15:48,260
a Russia willow fortunate give you the 
six.

319
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:50,990
But they have our letters too,
but they're backwards.

320
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,100
Like look at it,
look at that.

321
00:15:52,101 --> 00:15:52,934
Again,
this almost like look how they have 

322
00:15:55,161 --> 00:15:55,994
ours.
But they have a backwards capital are 

323
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:02,170
what never backwards,
lowercase,

324
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:05,600
and then it looks like that's insane.
Like look at that,

325
00:16:05,601 --> 00:16:08,820
you that you were the big Dick.
What does that does?

326
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:11,180
You have the big Dick and these ecu with
two dicks.

327
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,700
The Chair?
Yeah.

328
00:16:13,701 --> 00:16:17,360
This is a fascinating language.
RSP.

329
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:18,523
SSC.
I think if we lived on another planet 

330
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,753
and we were looking,
we were observing a giant culture that 

331
00:16:25,311 --> 00:16:26,144
had nuclear power,
but they all hadn't even agreed on the 

332
00:16:29,211 --> 00:16:30,620
same language yet.
We'd be like,

333
00:16:30,621 --> 00:16:34,910
what are these crazy assholes do?
What are they doing?

334
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:37,250
They're all speaking different.
They can understand each other.

335
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:39,920
They all have nuclear power and they can
understand each other.

336
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:40,843
So you're relying on translators and 
people to speak for you and 

337
00:16:43,611 --> 00:16:46,070
representatives.
And I know men.

338
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,500
Oh,
I watched that movie.

339
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,433
Clothing.
Cultural for the first time on 

340
00:16:50,001 --> 00:16:52,380
mushrooms.
Whoa man,

341
00:16:52,381 --> 00:16:53,600
man.
Dude.

342
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,300
And you read about communication with 
the community,

343
00:16:56,301 --> 00:16:58,280
with the UFOS and hook thing.

344
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:01,560
Dude,
dude,

345
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,670
dude do.
Didn't they have like a hand thing?

346
00:17:04,671 --> 00:17:05,810
Yes,
we would do with it.

347
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:11,330
That was amazing.
I was wondering like what if like humans

348
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:15,020
always think that they know what the 
other person might be saying,

349
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,173
right,
but what are the whole time you're like 

350
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:20,850
detonating a bomb with each other.
They add,

351
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,043
but the problem is like what they're 
saying means different things in 

352
00:17:24,831 --> 00:17:28,160
different cultures too.
It's just hit on earth.

353
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,500
People just have different styles of 
living.

354
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:31,903
You can't tell them they're wrong in 
Africa or the right Norwegia Norwegia 

355
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,940
region.
What does.

356
00:17:37,941 --> 00:17:38,960
Nor we'd.
Norway,

357
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:41,930
Norway.
How funny is that in Norwegia I'm coming

358
00:17:41,931 --> 00:17:43,280
up trying to come up with a cold 
weather.

359
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:46,670
I was in the middle of Iceland.
I should've went with Iceland,

360
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:49,070
Iceland,
but any place like that,

361
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,250
these

362
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,620
freezing climates.
Who's right,

363
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:55,440
who's,
I don't know who's right,

364
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,290
like teenager,
we had a guest on our podcast.

365
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:00,810
He said that he said that will never 
performing.

366
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,820
He said that they were spitting at them 
and he will.

367
00:18:04,821 --> 00:18:05,654
Why the experience you because of how 
they say we love you in Argentina when 

368
00:18:07,891 --> 00:18:12,891
you're performing like they spit at you,
that people do weird shirt used to it.

369
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,090
Right?
How about,

370
00:18:15,091 --> 00:18:18,870
uh,
in Iceland they eat this crazy shark,

371
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:19,943
it's like a,
a fermented shark and it's supposed to 

372
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:26,550
be disgusting for everybody else,
but them,

373
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:30,180
like they love it.
It's like a delicacy.

374
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,700
It's this for an in Bordain,
aiden,

375
00:18:32,701 --> 00:18:33,534
and he said it was discussed at the 
bunch of people have eaten it on TV 

376
00:18:36,721 --> 00:18:37,554
shows and shit and been like,
what the fuck can assure you that for 

377
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:41,843
some kind of fermented shark,
Iceland people are some strong fucking 

378
00:18:45,271 --> 00:18:45,690
people.

379
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:48,120
Man.
Those people live in Iceland.

380
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:53,150
Just think about how hard you have to be
for the huge man I seen.

381
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,590
I seen a video then working out.
Yeah,

382
00:18:55,591 --> 00:18:56,424
there's like a disproportionate number 
of the world's strongest men have come 

383
00:18:59,101 --> 00:19:00,910
from Iceland.
Big Ass pot,

384
00:19:00,911 --> 00:19:05,911
bunch of giant motherfuckers,
a lot of fucking beer to drink.

385
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:09,450
Whatever the fuck they want.
Those are vikings,

386
00:19:09,451 --> 00:19:11,490
man.
That's what's leftover.

387
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:15,030
That's what's leftover.
The Vikings back before guns,

388
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:18,360
it's like that just ran through 
villages,

389
00:19:18,361 --> 00:19:21,810
man Motherfucka and those are the last 
remnants.

390
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,793
Once people started developing guns,
then it became a fair fight and then 

391
00:19:25,651 --> 00:19:26,401
it's like,
oh,

392
00:19:26,401 --> 00:19:28,680
okay.
Before that,

393
00:19:28,681 --> 00:19:30,630
man,
the Viking showed up.

394
00:19:30,631 --> 00:19:33,960
You were Foxville.
That was no Bueno.

395
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:39,020
So heavier to giant swords if they were 
all,

396
00:19:39,021 --> 00:19:39,854
if like the whole,
there was an actual country filled with 

397
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:46,890
people as big as those strongest men 
guys and they decided to just take over.

398
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,930
There was no guns.
They just take over.

399
00:19:48,931 --> 00:19:51,600
That's how it works.
Arrows aren't not good enough.

400
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:56,190
Catapults not good enough.
So that was him in the legs.

401
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:01,980
That's good.
It's always good to have a little hyenas

402
00:20:01,981 --> 00:20:02,814
brody's away for them motherfuckers.
What do you think it would be like if 

403
00:20:04,831 --> 00:20:05,664
everybody spoke the same language?
Do you think if the world spoke one 

404
00:20:07,891 --> 00:20:08,724
language,
things would be better or would find 

405
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:11,783
other shit to hate each other for sooner
or later somebody will make a little 

406
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,510
language.
Yeah,

407
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:21,030
you're right.
Like we're not going to call him Mike.

408
00:20:21,031 --> 00:20:22,890
We're going to call him shit head.
Okay.

409
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:23,910
For Fun.
Right?

410
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:24,873
Like especially if people get to 
Controli with the language soon as 

411
00:20:28,111 --> 00:20:29,520
people do.
Don't say that word.

412
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,383
Don't say this word.
As soon as people get controlling with 

413
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:34,170
the language,
like let's make our own shit.

414
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:40,170
Like I was called problematic one time 
for what would you do?

415
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:44,580
I was just a did a show and um,
the lady went on and he goes,

416
00:20:44,581 --> 00:20:45,780
oh,
he's problematic.

417
00:20:45,781 --> 00:20:47,620
He's um,
what did he say?

418
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:48,220
He messed

419
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,380
my shoulder with the word male 
chauvinist.

420
00:20:50,381 --> 00:20:51,650
Yes.
Yeah,

421
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,970
because I just did,
was a joke,

422
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:57,550
but she heard like the trigger word 
against seven,

423
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,570
set her off.
So I guess she didn't hear that.

424
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,650
She didn't wait for the punchline.
I found that happened,

425
00:21:02,651 --> 00:21:04,810
but it's weird like the lady you should 
understand,

426
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,580
you know,
you went,

427
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,020
you walked into my show,
you know,

428
00:21:08,021 --> 00:21:08,854
with your friends.
They should have warned you that I say 

429
00:21:11,441 --> 00:21:12,274
words,
but you gotta wait for the fucking 

430
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:13,543
punchline,
bitch.

431
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:16,543
Yeah,
there's a turn coming up here hanging 

432
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:19,483
there.
Like I remember doing this show and I 

433
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:22,314
was just talking about my brother coming
in and out of prison a lot and they 

434
00:21:25,241 --> 00:21:27,760
booked me for the show.
It wasn't that much $200.

435
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,193
And I told my friend,
this comedian that I had worked with 

436
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,193
named Steve Flies fucking dirty.
I sort please just be clean for 10 

437
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:36,880
minutes please.

438
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,620
No surprise is brought up.
Pull your pants down,

439
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,990
just a quick eight if you have it.
So he did a quick eight,

440
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,240
50 solid.
Killed it.

441
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:48,370
I went up there.
It was doing okay.

442
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,940
I started talking about um,
whatever stretch marks.

443
00:21:51,941 --> 00:21:52,774
This is that.
Then I said my brother had been in 

444
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:57,130
prison a lot.
Every time he comes out worse,

445
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,570
the first time he came out,
a better thief.

446
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:04,450
The second time he came out racist,
like total racist.

447
00:22:04,451 --> 00:22:07,930
I'm Mexican guy.
And then the third time he came out even

448
00:22:07,931 --> 00:22:08,531
worse,
man,

449
00:22:08,531 --> 00:22:13,270
he came out of a born again Christian.
The tumor away from me.

450
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:16,810
She didn't wait for the punchline.
He don't steal no more.

451
00:22:16,811 --> 00:22:17,644
He blesses himself so you know,
and then she just took the microphone 

452
00:22:20,531 --> 00:22:23,170
away and the Fat Lady and she said,
that's enough for Mr.

453
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,383
Parsa

454
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,080
so crazy.
They don't let you say that.

455
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:33,490
She says thinking how foolish that is to
stop you from saying that like,

456
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,340
this is a problem.
There's a problem that people have.

457
00:22:36,341 --> 00:22:39,820
They feel righteous.
When you're talking about standup comedy

458
00:22:39,821 --> 00:22:42,460
in particular,
when you're setting up a joke like that,

459
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:44,710
you're gonna you're,
you're taking him for a ride.

460
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,480
They don't know what you're gonna say 
next.

461
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:48,123
You know,
and it's funny and to pretend that it's 

462
00:22:49,871 --> 00:22:52,210
not funny because it's talking about a 
certain subject,

463
00:22:52,211 --> 00:22:56,500
it's just crazy because it's not about 
not being able to talk about subjects.

464
00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:00,670
It should be like if someone has a 
heinous perspective,

465
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:01,091
like,
hey,

466
00:23:01,091 --> 00:23:03,370
I don't have a problem with kids,
get raped and killed,

467
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,130
and they start trying to make a joke 
about that.

468
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:09,280
Park a fuck man,
good luck.

469
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,143
You're on your own.
You know you have a obviously heinous 

470
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:14,260
perspective,
but that's not a heinous perspective.

471
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,093
What you're doing,
talking about a guy going to jail and 

472
00:23:17,141 --> 00:23:20,710
getting worse every time it comes out 
that that's also a reality.

473
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,780
It is.
It is a reality.

474
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:27,100
And to pay for people to deny that 
people become hardened criminals because

475
00:23:27,101 --> 00:23:29,260
they'd been in the joint three,
four times that joint.

476
00:23:29,261 --> 00:23:30,930
What am I living in the fifties?
I'm going,

477
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:35,441
come on,
man.

478
00:23:35,441 --> 00:23:36,274
That's crazy.
To deny that you're in there with 

479
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,030
fucking criminals and you know you're 
stuck in a cage,

480
00:23:40,031 --> 00:23:43,630
of course you're gonna come out worse.
That's where it's fucked up,

481
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:46,040
right?
It's like nobody's getting any better at

482
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:47,090
doing that.
No.

483
00:23:47,091 --> 00:23:49,820
No one ever re-engineered the whole 
prison system.

484
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,300
No one ever re engineered the whole 
people system and looks.

485
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:53,811
He goes,
why?

486
00:23:53,811 --> 00:23:58,811
Why don't we just continue to have crime
emanate out of these unfortunate areas.

487
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:02,390
If you just fix those areas,
fix it.

488
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,253
You.
Is it possible that you could have no 

489
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,840
like extreme poverty on earth?
Is it possible?

490
00:24:08,841 --> 00:24:10,400
Do we have enough resources?
Do.

491
00:24:10,401 --> 00:24:11,234
Does anybody know?
Like do people think that in order to 

492
00:24:14,511 --> 00:24:15,344
live the way we live now that somebody 
somewhere has to live in extreme 

493
00:24:19,341 --> 00:24:20,174
poverty?
Is that like what they think or is it 

494
00:24:21,801 --> 00:24:24,080
just a,
a spot where stuck at?

495
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:25,813
Well,
I'm,

496
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:30,410
I think I'm the only one that will 
happen if nobody really.

497
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:33,950
It would just be middle class and poor 
than everybody will have something.

498
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,103
Yeah,
because cause I know it's just rich and 

499
00:24:36,831 --> 00:24:37,664
middle class and poor.
The rich would have to give half to the 

500
00:24:40,311 --> 00:24:43,640
middle class in the middle cloud to give
to the poor Jesus.

501
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:45,500
Not enough money to go around.
Sorry.

502
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:47,390
Yeah.
Is that.

503
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:50,600
Is that real?
Like if you had all the resources on new

504
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,940
resources,
people to volunteer,

505
00:24:52,941 --> 00:24:54,500
man,
volunteer for what?

506
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:56,660
To help people like you.
Okay.

507
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:59,600
You care about dogs so much?
I don't see your work doing.

508
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:01,460
Putting it in eight hours and no 
shelter.

509
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,640
Walking these dogs for free.
What does it say?

510
00:25:04,641 --> 00:25:08,900
Billionaires make so much money.
Last year they could end extreme poverty

511
00:25:08,901 --> 00:25:10,420
seven times.
She says,

512
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,520
where's the profit in that?
Oh my God,

513
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:16,640
that is crazy.
Roughly six out of the seven,

514
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,700
the top 500 richest people.
Southern network.

515
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:25,500
The net wealth created this year is a 
staggering 259 point 4 billion here.

516
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:29,210
The top five richest people who saw 
massive gains is here.

517
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,730
Oh boy.
Jeff Bezos in the house,

518
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:36,780
CEO of Amazon $35 billion to his net 
worth this year.

519
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:41,280
Holy Shit.
I don't know how to say this gentleman a

520
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:45,320
ever grants chairman.
Background grew $25 million.

521
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,183
Yeah.
These guys are fucking making Bernard 

522
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,251
Baby.
What's his name?

523
00:25:49,251 --> 00:25:50,240
Barnard what?
Barnard?

524
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,333
Looking at cash baby.
Twenty 4 million Zuckerberg Zuckerberg 

525
00:25:55,851 --> 00:25:56,820
in the house.

526
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,840
$4,000,000,000
money.

527
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,670
Woo.
Yeah,

528
00:26:01,671 --> 00:26:03,140
there's some.
But here's the thing,

529
00:26:03,141 --> 00:26:04,820
man,
if you're going to have a game,

530
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,113
and I'm not,
I'm not advocating for capitalism or 

531
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:10,400
communism or socialism.
Not Advocating for anything.

532
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,370
What I'm going to say,
if you.

533
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:16,370
If you're going to have a game and 
you're trying to figure out what,

534
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:22,070
how much of a certain thing.
And if you own that thing,

535
00:26:22,071 --> 00:26:23,840
you could do way more stuff,
right?

536
00:26:23,841 --> 00:26:26,450
You could buy a private jet to get a big
house.

537
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:29,120
So what is it?
What are the,

538
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,510
what are the steps you have to take in 
order to get that thing?

539
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,733
And is there a too much?
Could someone have all of it and 

540
00:26:36,981 --> 00:26:39,470
everybody else has zero.
Is that possible?

541
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:40,603
What if there's like there's no rule 
that says you have to do something with 

542
00:26:42,771 --> 00:26:44,220
it either.
Like you could just

543
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,620
collect it all,
burn it,

544
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,190
but that'd be an asshole move.
But in every game there's rules.

545
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:51,863
Technically.
There's no rule here that says Bayzos 

546
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:55,830
couldn't just when it.
For sure for sure.

547
00:26:55,831 --> 00:26:56,880
No,
I'm not.

548
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:59,460
I'm not saying.
What I'm saying is,

549
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,990
is it possible that someone could get to
a point where they have all the money?

550
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,453
I mean,
if this has happened before what jp 

551
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,300
Morgan had other money,
it was really.

552
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,100
Yes,
I saw that,

553
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:18,510
that Dr Ritu the men who built America 
at one time he held,

554
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:21,540
he held a monopoly and all the steel in 
the world.

555
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:23,203
Well,
one thing that people really resist is 

556
00:27:24,871 --> 00:27:27,390
if you try to make new money,
you know,

557
00:27:27,391 --> 00:27:30,540
that's why people are like really edgy 
about bitcoin.

558
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:33,000
You know,
what the fuck's going on?

559
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:36,600
This is their own real money.
They're buying houses with bitcoin.

560
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,460
People are selling houses with bitcoin.

561
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:41,490
Oh,
to a bitcoin.

562
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,473
Listen man,
in this day and age with the kind of 

563
00:27:44,881 --> 00:27:45,714
trust that people have in government and
government decisions when it comes to 

564
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:52,050
economics,
that bit point stuff,

565
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,913
any crypto currency stuff becomes more 
and more interesting to people because 

566
00:27:55,981 --> 00:27:56,814
they go,
these crazy fuckers aren't fixing 

567
00:27:57,841 --> 00:27:58,674
nothing,
man.

568
00:27:58,870 --> 00:27:59,703
Well now when I was living in a while,
I grew up in a Pico Aliso people 

569
00:28:03,501 --> 00:28:05,310
gardens,
at least we'll build housing projects.

570
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:06,780
We had a,
we have,

571
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:07,843
we let our,
my mom didn't have money in a bank for 

572
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,870
at first our neighborhood and have money
in the bank.

573
00:28:12,871 --> 00:28:17,250
So they started their own little bank.
Like we had this thing called a,

574
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,820
I don't know how to say it in English 
called Dina.

575
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:21,503
We get like I guess 10 families that we 
know and every week somebody puts $100 

576
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,680
in the pot.
So there's 10 of us and everybody puts a

577
00:28:30,681 --> 00:28:34,380
$100 and we all take turns every week 
collecting the pot.

578
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:38,370
So you and I in him and seven other 
people were putting in $100.

579
00:28:38,371 --> 00:28:39,204
That's a thousand dollars.
So that way this week Joe Rogan gets it 

580
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:44,790
and next week everybody puts it $100 
again.

581
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,460
And this time he takes it,
he gets 100,000

582
00:28:47,461 --> 00:28:48,294
dollars and then the next week I get a 
thousand dollars to everybody makes a 

583
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,540
thousand dollars.
So that would be like the way we used to

584
00:28:54,541 --> 00:28:56,760
learn each other out,
money in the hood.

585
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,190
It works hard on the,
on the honor system,

586
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,560
but it works out.
It never works out.

587
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:06,590
It always failed because usually like if
one guy really what do they want to pay?

588
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:08,363
Something will happen,
know it'll look bad on his family in 

589
00:29:10,261 --> 00:29:11,094
Mexico or we'll go hunt that food down.
But I used to do that with what I used 

590
00:29:16,051 --> 00:29:19,650
to be the guy that used to collect all 
the money from these people when I was a

591
00:29:19,651 --> 00:29:20,160
little boy.

592
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,440
I was like 12,
13 years old.

593
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,513
Walking in the neighborhood was a 
thousand dollars in cash and passing it 

594
00:29:26,371 --> 00:29:28,140
to this house.
But no one knew that.

595
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:28,974
But there's this whole,
this is how money marketing worked in 

596
00:29:31,651 --> 00:29:32,484
the neighborhood while everybody was 
borrowing for somebody could no weapon 

597
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,310
alone,
a thousand dollars.

598
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,440
Right to.
That's interesting man.

599
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:42,700
That's a.
that's a really cool way to handle it.

600
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,133
That's a cool game.
Like our social game that everybody's 

601
00:29:46,271 --> 00:29:49,510
playing with each other.
That's a cool way to do it.

602
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:50,850
I'm not,
I'm,

603
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:52,960
I'm in commerce.
Could do it if they got together.

604
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:55,040
Oh fuck you.
You can't pay a rate.

605
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,990
Okay.
If 10 people put $100 each,

606
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,800
that's a great idea,
man.

607
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:03,610
That's a great idea.
And just pass it around.

608
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,860
That's a fucking great idea,
man.

609
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:06,993
That's something that's a social 
security that you'd be happy to 

610
00:30:09,401 --> 00:30:13,120
contribute to get a group of your 
friends and do that.

611
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:14,403
That's super smart because then you get 
these little bursts of a big chunk of 

612
00:30:17,561 --> 00:30:18,394
money.
Yes.

613
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:19,860
Yeah,
man,

614
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:22,510
I like it.
That's a social thing too,

615
00:30:22,511 --> 00:30:23,344
right?
Yeah.

616
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:27,460
I don't know who came up with it,
but we have a social thing.

617
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:28,883
Do you know,
it's something that keeps people 

618
00:30:30,431 --> 00:30:31,264
communicating with each other and 
talking about shit and getting excited 

619
00:30:33,491 --> 00:30:36,220
about it.
That's bad ass man.

620
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,440
He was a hustler man.
My mom sewed.

621
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,303
We used to go to um,
because I live in boyle heights and 

622
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,500
we're next to Delta Lane.
There's so many,

623
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:45,910
so,
so many fucking factories.

624
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,870
And my mom knew she was just,
you know,

625
00:30:49,871 --> 00:30:50,704
like where everything was.
We used to go to this one factory and 

626
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:56,510
this trash can,
we'll throw in a trash can.

627
00:30:56,511 --> 00:31:00,880
I in the band it was nothing but I'm 
synthetic cotton,

628
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:04,300
so it was like this fake carton made of 
plastic.

629
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:08,020
We have to take it out of the trash and 
put in hefty bags.

630
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:09,343
They were my would will go home and my 
mom was sold me pillowcases and we'll 

631
00:31:13,261 --> 00:31:14,800
sell pillows.
Wow,

632
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:19,030
that's hilarious.
Dude.

633
00:31:19,031 --> 00:31:20,110
You had a crazy life.

634
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,250
You know,

635
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:30,150
I couldn't imagine.
How did the the little boy do pretending

636
00:31:30,831 --> 00:31:33,400
to be the little girl.
How did he do when he went to jail,

637
00:31:33,401 --> 00:31:37,810
Bro?
He was sucked into it.

638
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Who Do you think that he would have been
gay either way.

639
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:48,980
You never know.
Is it possible that wow,

640
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,450
maybe it was just gay.
Maybe that's why they chose him.

641
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:56,560
My brother fought like I had this joke.
I heard this story for many,

642
00:31:56,561 --> 00:31:59,650
many years but didn't know how to.
How to put it out there.

643
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,660
Then my brother,
he told me,

644
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:03,340
hey,
you should do that.

645
00:32:03,341 --> 00:32:04,174
Joke about how he crossed the border and
my mom made me dress up as a little 

646
00:32:07,001 --> 00:32:08,620
girl.
I saw you.

647
00:32:08,621 --> 00:32:09,454
Sure Matt,
because people are going to call you 

648
00:32:11,021 --> 00:32:13,710
that.
They're going to call you and ask Julia.

649
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,790
That really happened.
So what?

650
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:18,850
So yeah.
So yeah,

651
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,260
he's,
I did it and he didn't care.

652
00:32:20,261 --> 00:32:21,550
And um,
his,

653
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:26,610
his husband was a prize.
My brother married to this city planner.

654
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:30,010
Oh really?
Yeah.

655
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,820
That's hilarious.
But it's crazy.

656
00:32:34,821 --> 00:32:35,461
You know,
Joe,

657
00:32:35,461 --> 00:32:37,680
like gum,
how naive,

658
00:32:37,681 --> 00:32:38,514
you know parents can be because my 
brother came out being a homosexual and 

659
00:32:42,231 --> 00:32:47,231
my mouth goes why?
And my father to why?

660
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:50,830
Why?
That's right.

661
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:53,570
You can't figure it out motherfucker.
You just have like a little girl.

662
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:57,110
There was two asshole.
Do you think that's possible?

663
00:32:57,111 --> 00:32:58,980
Maybe.
Do you think it's the,

664
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:01,550
here's the thing,
he was destined maybe.

665
00:33:01,551 --> 00:33:02,480
I don't know.
I don't know.

666
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:03,890
It might,
it might be,

667
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:08,780
but there is a possibility that uh,
you know,

668
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,693
people are malleable.
You can kind of steer them in different 

669
00:33:14,331 --> 00:33:15,710
ways.
The question is,

670
00:33:15,711 --> 00:33:18,380
are those ways good or bad?
You know,

671
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,333
it's,
if he's happy and he's gay and they 

672
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:23,780
became gay because he dressed him up as 
a little girl.

673
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:26,060
If you really truly care about gay 
people,

674
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,210
does that bother you?
It's a weird question,

675
00:33:29,211 --> 00:33:29,480
right?

676
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,171
It's like,
wow,

677
00:33:30,171 --> 00:33:30,880
man,
I don't know.

678
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,160
I could you firmly believe in equality 
of,

679
00:33:34,161 --> 00:33:34,994
of,
of sexual orientation if you firmly 

680
00:33:38,151 --> 00:33:38,984
believe in total equality,
he should have no issue with someone 

681
00:33:41,661 --> 00:33:45,440
turning a little boy gay mean really?
You should,

682
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:46,760
but then there's the thing like,
no,

683
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:46,941
no,
no,

684
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:47,774
no.
I want people to decide their own 

685
00:33:49,551 --> 00:33:50,384
destiny,
but no one decides their own destiny 

686
00:33:51,711 --> 00:33:53,060
religiously.
Right?

687
00:33:53,061 --> 00:33:54,920
Little kids get introduced into 
religion,

688
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:58,280
but sexually it's work at super 
important for us.

689
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:02,080
Yes.
We don't let the boy be a ball boy.

690
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:03,290
I don't know.
Fuck boy,

691
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,133
son.
Hey.

692
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,960
Hey.
Give me some boxing gloves.

693
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:08,340
Get out of there.
Put the helmet on stops.

694
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:09,183
Third,
that Bo Jackson poster and a motorcycle 

695
00:34:10,821 --> 00:34:14,480
and fucking ride around with shirts off.
Yeah man.

696
00:34:14,481 --> 00:34:15,680
Right.
It's like A.

697
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:18,770
People get super scared if someone 
turned the kid gay.

698
00:34:18,771 --> 00:34:20,330
Like what?
What happened?

699
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:22,550
What happened?
Some people put up barriers though.

700
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:25,490
They allow their kids would just be what
they want to be,

701
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:28,550
but here's the thing.
I don't know if that's possible,

702
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:31,670
but I definitely think with no 
intervention,

703
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:34,520
there's a lot of people that are just 
gay.

704
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,890
They're just gay,
was crazy in that.

705
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:40,700
Isn't there like A.
There's like a spectrum of gay though,

706
00:34:40,701 --> 00:34:41,690
right?
Oh,

707
00:34:41,691 --> 00:34:42,630
those levels,
bro.

708
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,753
There's levels like there's the.
Well I know because of my brother a 

709
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,640
negative.
He never.

710
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,503
My brother,
like there's my brother's friends are 

711
00:34:52,731 --> 00:34:54,710
really,
really cool and they're really funny.

712
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:58,670
But they're were flamboyant and my 
brother not,

713
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,120
at least not around us.
You know?

714
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,900
Who cares if he is though,
right?

715
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:03,770
Yeah.
Who Cares?

716
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:06,043
Yeah,
they not.

717
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,710
That's a funny thing man.
Like flamboyant gay,

718
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:10,460
that the,
that,

719
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,350
the,
that the,

720
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:14,420
the gay.
I knew growing up the flamboyant one,

721
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:17,360
but we uh,
we celebrate that.

722
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,280
Right?
Like look at him.

723
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:20,123
Woo.
You see a dude with like a halter top 

724
00:35:21,891 --> 00:35:23,360
on.
You know what I mean?

725
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,253
Like days in cut off shorts,
like a rainbow striped socks on your 

726
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,070
like kick damn go.
You go boy.

727
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:35,000
Flamboyant Gay.
Like we'd love flamboyant gay.

728
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,850
But like a,
a girl dressed like that.

729
00:35:38,851 --> 00:35:39,331
It's like,
Oh,

730
00:35:39,331 --> 00:35:44,331
you unfortunate you unfortunate child.
Like look at you with your 17 inch pumps

731
00:35:45,661 --> 00:35:50,220
on with your shorts up to crack your ass
with your tiny top on.

732
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:52,650
That is so sad that you need that much 
attention.

733
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:55,140
Isn't that weird?
Weird man.

734
00:35:55,141 --> 00:35:55,921
It's weird,
man.

735
00:35:55,921 --> 00:35:59,340
When it's a boy and he's gay,
we fucking celebrate the shit out of it.

736
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:00,503
Looking at me.
He's got all these crazy multicolored 

737
00:36:02,491 --> 00:36:06,570
beads on and he's just fucking blaring 
gay.

738
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:08,670
That data.
Hell yeah.

739
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:12,540
We think that the rave,
but a girl that's just screaming out for

740
00:36:12,541 --> 00:36:12,930
Dick.

741
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:14,010
Oh,
you poor child.

742
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:16,110
You stop that.
Stop it.

743
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,340
You stop it.
What do you.

744
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:19,530
What do you want sex.
She's like her mom.

745
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:21,990
You're not going to get love that way.
You're not going to get love.

746
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,730
You just going to get a bunch of guys 
want to fuck you.

747
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:24,583
There's a lot of pressure on loose women
are the girls because a member like 

748
00:36:27,601 --> 00:36:28,670
growing up.
Oh,

749
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:32,100
she's a good girl,
bad girl,

750
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,830
bad girl.
And we're the good girls.

751
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:37,890
If you were a good girl,
I wouldn't be mad at you all the time.

752
00:36:37,891 --> 00:36:39,510
Melissa.
Melissa.

753
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,880
Melissa,
can you be a cousin?

754
00:36:41,881 --> 00:36:43,260
Jennifer?
She's a good girl.

755
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:46,530
I can't believe you did coke.
I can't believe my daughter.

756
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:53,580
Do people love coke?
They do.

757
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:55,080
You know Dundas Stove,
right?

758
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:56,660
No,
never just pot.

759
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:58,150
Right?
I drink,

760
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:00,600
I don't drink a lot,
but I drank.

761
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:03,690
I see him drink bud light once.
What?

762
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:05,670
Or the fuck?
Oh,

763
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,620
will last.
My biggest,

764
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:09,930
the one of my best memories,
man.

765
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:12,330
Comedian that you're drinking a bud 
light.

766
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,840
It was like,
it was like,

767
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:20,390
it was like 1999 thanksgiving.
It was like the,

768
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,293
you know,
like things given already passed in 

769
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:24,080
Friday.
It was like a,

770
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:24,710
you know,
the,

771
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,760
the,
the Friday after Thanksgiving,

772
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:27,983
the Wednesday before thanksgiving.
It's totally like the best days for me 

773
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:33,810
or anybody.
And for comedy too,

774
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,090
especially with the comedy show on 
Wednesday.

775
00:37:36,091 --> 00:37:38,740
And then the next day,
the stories,

776
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:40,740
the chicks everywhere.
Music,

777
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:44,310
the good times man drugs.
But this one particular time,

778
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:48,800
my brother Fernando or whatever,
um,

779
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:49,851
I call them up,
hey,

780
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:51,120
I'm going to,
we're going to go watch.

781
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:56,110
I have a show at the or,
and me and other comedians showed up and

782
00:37:56,111 --> 00:37:58,450
then we're going to go see you.
That's when you had your,

783
00:37:58,451 --> 00:37:59,284
your,
your fucking hot ass webpage to 

784
00:38:01,001 --> 00:38:05,100
oregon.net.
And you said you were going to perform.

785
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:09,660
So we went to go see you at the main 
room right after our sets.

786
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:13,110
You fucking crushed it.
He's a fucking beard bit.

787
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,730
It was hilarious.
Crushed it.

788
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,193
But then after what you saying,
I heard you tell somebody that we're 

789
00:38:18,751 --> 00:38:22,350
going to go to the house of blues 
because it was his birthday.

790
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,570
Yeah.
So I said,

791
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:24,660
fuck it.
Let's go to.

792
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,640
So we are winning and we were across the
street man.

793
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:30,983
It was like so many comedians have that 
time at the House of Blues and Rick 

794
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,390
James showed up.
Started playing the piano.

795
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:45,590
That was the shit man.
Yeah man.

796
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:49,070
That was a chewy.
Did quite a few shows over there.

797
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,233
How many shows did he do over there?
He did one every once a month on a 

798
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:55,070
Tuesday too.
He was good and it was like,

799
00:38:55,071 --> 00:38:55,761
wait a minute,
wait a minute,

800
00:38:55,761 --> 00:38:57,410
wait a minute.
This is chewy.

801
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:03,040
The dude who's the door guy at the 
comedy store is a bad ass musician.

802
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,140
That song hate chewy.
What's going on?

803
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:10,410
That's actually,
that's a great fucking song.

804
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,540
That's a great song.
And I was sitting there going,

805
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,400
how crazy is this?
So we didn't know.

806
00:39:14,401 --> 00:39:17,370
Our friend Chewy has this special gift.
He was good.

807
00:39:17,371 --> 00:39:19,740
I would put big overalls.
He was good.

808
00:39:19,741 --> 00:39:22,770
It was cool to watch too.
Like it was a cool show.

809
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:26,010
Like we had a good fucking time.
He was a good musician,

810
00:39:26,011 --> 00:39:26,820
Huh?
Dude.

811
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,860
He's a real good musician and he's our 
friend.

812
00:39:28,861 --> 00:39:29,850
It was so.
It was crazy.

813
00:39:29,851 --> 00:39:32,240
It was both.
It was like you're seeing your friend on

814
00:39:32,241 --> 00:39:34,500
stage and then you seen your friend 
kill.

815
00:39:34,501 --> 00:39:35,041
You're like,
damn,

816
00:39:35,041 --> 00:39:36,870
he's good.
This is good.

817
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:40,440
It was awesome.
I remember one time mom dumped me.

818
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:45,520
He was doing his,
his jokes that the orn he said holly was

819
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:49,810
fucked up.
Like that guy right there,

820
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:51,250
chewy.
He.

821
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:54,600
He's a rock star.
Rock star once a month.

822
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:56,700
Kills it.
Right now.

823
00:39:57,330 --> 00:39:58,800
He's telling me where the fucking park.

824
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:09,110
I think you'd like working there to be 
honest with mailed the letter for me one

825
00:40:09,451 --> 00:40:12,720
night when we're putting the letters up.
I always enjoy that guy.

826
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,920
He was always very cool to me to,
you know,

827
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:19,020
said people are scared of chewing.
Juliana.

828
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,850
I always got along great.
You know,

829
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,510
he just looked like the wrong dude to 
fuck with him,

830
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,690
like hillbilly but Mexican,
but he's a gentleman,

831
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:30,240
always a gentlemen,
if you're a good guy to chew it,

832
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:33,600
he's a great guy to you.
But he's a talented musician.

833
00:40:33,601 --> 00:40:34,800
Man.
It was crazy to watch.

834
00:40:34,801 --> 00:40:35,634
It's crazy to watch your friend just 
killing it at the house of Blues after 

835
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,740
just say what's up,
what's up chewy?

836
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:42,270
You know that song.
But that song,

837
00:40:42,271 --> 00:40:43,470
Hey Joe,
what's going on?

838
00:40:43,471 --> 00:40:45,750
That's like,
he made a really good song.

839
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:47,790
Shoulders.
Right?

840
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:50,940
Did he kind of.
I'm trying to remember.

841
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:54,120
I'm definitely lifted it up.
It was fucking great man.

842
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:56,280
He was great.
Like he was like,

843
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,413
he's a,
he was a guy that I would actually go 

844
00:40:58,531 --> 00:40:59,610
see.
I was like,

845
00:40:59,611 --> 00:41:00,444
this is amazing.
That's one thing I liked about being a 

846
00:41:03,451 --> 00:41:07,650
comedian that when I was younger was 
hoping to do after where the was crazy.

847
00:41:07,651 --> 00:41:09,510
You know,
like,

848
00:41:09,511 --> 00:41:14,070
even when like for sometimes you know,
you go to like dark areas,

849
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:15,480
you know,
if you want to party hard.

850
00:41:15,481 --> 00:41:19,910
Like I had a kid one time,
I was doing a short Montebello.

851
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,470
Remember Willie Barcelona?
Yeah,

852
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,330
really works,
said it,

853
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:28,330
had that crazy ass fucking wildly for 11
years and somebody came in and said,

854
00:41:30,001 --> 00:41:32,190
I'm thinking this comedian yours.
He said,

855
00:41:32,191 --> 00:41:33,530
hey man,
there's this guy,

856
00:41:33,531 --> 00:41:36,620
they're looking for Comedians to perform
at three in the morning,

857
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:39,650
got a harder bucks.
And I said,

858
00:41:39,651 --> 00:41:41,030
fuck it,
I ain't doing shit.

859
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,940
I ain't doing shit.
I ain't got alive.

860
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,970
So he gave him the address and we get 
there.

861
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:48,283
It's like an undercover police officer,
security guard as his house in Burbank 

862
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,353
and um,
we perform at three in the morning for 

863
00:41:55,491 --> 00:41:57,980
them,
but all the shit in their house.

864
00:41:57,981 --> 00:41:59,390
Yeah man.
And what Joe,

865
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:04,391
the house was built for like partying,
like 80 style were like,

866
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,620
we don't,
you don't even know what time it is.

867
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:11,510
Like the coaches were there,
courteous all over the house.

868
00:42:11,511 --> 00:42:12,344
You couldn't see the sun come in.
No more so lit perfectly like the house 

869
00:42:15,951 --> 00:42:17,570
look like at 5:00
PM all day.

870
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:18,613
Wow.
And all over the house there was drugs 

871
00:42:22,491 --> 00:42:23,324
but there were not openly out there for 
everybody to take only like four people 

872
00:42:26,661 --> 00:42:29,540
who knew what was going on.
He had liquid coke.

873
00:42:29,541 --> 00:42:32,300
They're like the,
you know the nasal sprays?

874
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:33,223
Yeah,
he had like those filled with water and 

875
00:42:35,661 --> 00:42:36,494
coke because they can do,
when you do coke sometimes the coke is 

876
00:42:39,351 --> 00:42:40,184
stuck in your knees and your nose so 
you're going to pour a little water to 

877
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:43,910
help it go down.

878
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:47,060
Jesus.
But this guy had little squeeze Varvatos

879
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:49,550
all over the house,
like nasal sprays,

880
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,433
Haley's.
So I will see people lean over in the 

881
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:54,890
back of the house and then grab 
something.

882
00:42:54,891 --> 00:42:57,950
And so then I found out where it was and
I just,

883
00:42:57,951 --> 00:42:59,810
instead of just putting it back,
I just walked it with.

884
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:04,811
I kept it God damn.
Because I stood at that House to 1130 in

885
00:43:05,601 --> 00:43:08,750
the morning and I got there at two in 
the morning.

886
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:11,870
But this is funny.
The Guy who owned the house,

887
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,640
he had nobody cleaning the house.
So everybody like it.

888
00:43:15,641 --> 00:43:18,070
Like if you grab a little bit from his 
house,

889
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:18,913
like,
like if Joe Rogan picked up those beer 

890
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:23,870
through return trashcan,
he'll give you points.

891
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,170
Like,
like Doug,

892
00:43:25,171 --> 00:43:29,930
he points his name was doug.
Joe Rogan got three points.

893
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,153
So if you get like,
so this house you got invited to his 

894
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:36,230
house,
bike by text because Doug knows you,

895
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:39,140
but he knows you,
someone else invite to you,

896
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:41,870
but now that you got points,
you know enough points,

897
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,250
you get a personal call.

898
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:46,190
That's crazy.
It was crazy.

899
00:43:46,191 --> 00:43:47,730
There was a guy walking around.
Hello Lynn,

900
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:52,310
Marilyn Manson.
But it wasn't Marilyn Manson just looked

901
00:43:52,311 --> 00:43:57,010
like he was just hired for the show.
I guess for the Party to.

902
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:00,620
I hate to bring up this thing with your 
brother again though.

903
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:02,240
I'm bringing it up.
But this is.

904
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:06,570
Do you think it is possible really that 
if someone dresses their kid up,

905
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:07,663
all jokes aside,
is that possible that if you dress your 

906
00:44:10,191 --> 00:44:15,050
kid up as a girl for like a little bit 
and coach them into acting like a girl,

907
00:44:15,051 --> 00:44:18,500
that it turns them gay?
I don't honestly.

908
00:44:18,501 --> 00:44:19,334
All jokes aside,
I don't really think it works like this 

909
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,600
stop right when they got here.
Or did he keep playing that way?

910
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,340
No,
I don't think he,

911
00:44:25,341 --> 00:44:25,731
he,
he,

912
00:44:25,731 --> 00:44:26,420
uh,
he stopped.

913
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:27,253
He was like a male afterwards.
But it could have been a total 

914
00:44:29,811 --> 00:44:32,100
coincidence.
I think was probably coincidence.

915
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,290
It just happened.
Yeah,

916
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:35,543
but no,
nobody wants to think that people that 

917
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:38,940
susceptible,
but they definitely are in some ways,

918
00:44:38,941 --> 00:44:41,730
right.
Maybe not sexually because that seems to

919
00:44:41,731 --> 00:44:45,060
be like a biological thing,
but in terms of like behavior,

920
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:47,490
like racism for sure.
Right.

921
00:44:47,491 --> 00:44:50,910
Racism carries from,
from parent to child pretty pretty well,

922
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,073
you know,
if they have a good relationship with 

923
00:44:53,401 --> 00:44:55,470
their parents and their parents are 
racist,

924
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,460
that shit will carry in because a lot of
people who are racist,

925
00:44:58,461 --> 00:45:00,900
they still love their kids so they're 
really good at their kids,

926
00:45:00,901 --> 00:45:04,740
but they're racist.
So the kids associate really good,

927
00:45:04,741 --> 00:45:05,574
like love with family also with like 
distrust of certain certain groups and 

928
00:45:11,191 --> 00:45:12,024
colors and that's a almost a thing that 
they're taught by the people that care 

929
00:45:16,441 --> 00:45:18,060
about them,
like wild animals.

930
00:45:18,061 --> 00:45:18,910
Man.
They're taught well,

931
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:23,880
wild animal behavior by their parents 
and that's the same shit with people.

932
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:26,740
It's a weird thing,
man.

933
00:45:26,741 --> 00:45:29,250
It's weird.
It's a weird thing that human beings are

934
00:45:29,251 --> 00:45:30,600
malleable.
You know,

935
00:45:30,601 --> 00:45:33,750
that the,
you can get them to behave a certain way

936
00:45:33,751 --> 00:45:34,584
in Iceland,
but then a different way in Brazil or a 

937
00:45:36,781 --> 00:45:39,330
certain way in Japan and a different way
in China.

938
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:40,620
Like I was,
uh,

939
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:41,573
I was in China recently.
One of the things that's crazy is when 

940
00:45:43,471 --> 00:45:46,800
you're around large groups of people,
they just walk in front of you,

941
00:45:46,801 --> 00:45:48,960
man.
They just walked through you.

942
00:45:48,961 --> 00:45:51,720
They walked through little kids,
they walked through everybody.

943
00:45:51,721 --> 00:45:52,554
And it's not rude,
it's just they have a different way of 

944
00:45:54,781 --> 00:45:58,110
moving around because there's so many 
people and so many spots in China,

945
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:01,200
they're not being rude.
They don't consider it rude.

946
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:02,213
It's just different.
They're just trying to get there and 

947
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:05,640
they don't mind everybody bumps into 
each other a little bit.

948
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:06,540
We're like,
Oh,

949
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:08,040
you touched me.
Oh,

950
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:08,903
I can't believe this.
That guy touched me with his hand 

951
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:14,340
doesn't buy into their fucking head 
butting each other,

952
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,540
but they're not doing it mean they just 
kind of going through each other.

953
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:20,610
They don't mind touching each other.
So they're just,

954
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:21,780
you know,
you see an opening,

955
00:46:21,781 --> 00:46:22,930
they're going in that opening.
Oh,

956
00:46:22,931 --> 00:46:25,410
you don't look it,
you don't own the space in front of you,

957
00:46:25,411 --> 00:46:26,520
bitch.
There's a little spot.

958
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:27,750
I'm going to go in there.
Boom.

959
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:31,650
And they don't think it's bad thing.
They do it here to Chinese people do.

960
00:46:31,651 --> 00:46:34,080
Oh yeah.
Asian people know Armenian people.

961
00:46:34,081 --> 00:46:36,270
Older people were trying to catch the 
bus.

962
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,420
We were all trying to cut in a bus and 
they run.

963
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:40,200
They rush in front of me.
They don't say,

964
00:46:40,201 --> 00:46:42,510
excuse me.
That's why I know how to say,

965
00:46:42,511 --> 00:46:44,690
excuse me,
and Armenian mixing.

966
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:45,863
You know when people don't mind being 
jammed up like that in the winter in 

967
00:46:50,431 --> 00:46:54,450
Boston when they get on the team,
you know those trains,

968
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:55,343
like if you leave in fenway park and 
it's like fucking zero degrees outside 

969
00:46:59,161 --> 00:46:59,994
in the winter and you get on the tea 
together and especially if it's sunny 

970
00:47:02,761 --> 00:47:03,594
out so nobody feels creepy about it and 
they shut those doors and everybody is 

971
00:47:06,141 --> 00:47:09,070
just jammed in there huddled together.
Who?

972
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:10,021
Penguins.
Yeah,

973
00:47:10,021 --> 00:47:13,620
you don't mind.
You don't mind your fucking freezing.

974
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:17,760
So everybody has more of a sense of.
That's like a big problem with La.

975
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:18,893
It's too easy to just live here.
It's too easy to like physically 

976
00:47:21,751 --> 00:47:23,050
survive.
It's too hot.

977
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:24,930
The hot,
the heat's one thing,

978
00:47:24,931 --> 00:47:26,880
but you could get by.
You get used to that.

979
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:30,610
You can't get used to the cold,
but you can't do it.

980
00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:32,170
You can't stay out there.

981
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:34,990
You could stay.
It's the heat's way easier.

982
00:47:34,991 --> 00:47:39,670
You could stay out there if you have a 
shade and you have some water and live.

983
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:43,630
You literally can't live in Boston 
outside.

984
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:44,170
No,
you can't.

985
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:46,600
You can't go to sleep there.
If you go to sleep there,

986
00:47:46,601 --> 00:47:48,880
you'll die.
You won't make it.

987
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,310
It's zero degrees out.
You're not going to make it.

988
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:52,150
Oh,
it's.

989
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:56,230
You can't just sleep on the ground when 
it's 30 below zero,

990
00:47:56,231 --> 00:47:59,540
like in Alaska or some shit here in 
panhandle and that code.

991
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:00,783
No,
and so you're going to be a hardy 

992
00:48:01,931 --> 00:48:05,140
motherfucker to survive those places.
It's too easy to survive la.

993
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:07,990
We don't have enough interaction with 
nature.

994
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:10,003
We've got a distorted sense of where 
we're sitting in this whole thing in 

995
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:13,330
nature.
Go to Griffith Park.

996
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:14,770
Yeah.
We don't even have bugs,

997
00:48:14,771 --> 00:48:16,480
man.
When I was in Thailand,

998
00:48:16,481 --> 00:48:17,560
they got crazy bugs.

999
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,300
Do bugs.
Bite the fuck out of here.

1000
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:24,520
We got this little weird bites all over.
You and mosquitoes are ferocious.

1001
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,770
Those are real bugs,
man.

1002
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:28,480
We got here.
Roaches.

1003
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:31,030
We got nothing.
We got a few roaches.

1004
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:34,120
We barely have any flies.
We ain't got shit.

1005
00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:36,760
No bugs want a part of this crazy dry 
air.

1006
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:39,010
That's the.
We're super lucky,

1007
00:48:39,011 --> 00:48:39,844
man.
Bugs don't like dry air bugs like the 

1008
00:48:42,851 --> 00:48:45,430
crawley ones don't seem to mind,
but the fly,

1009
00:48:45,431 --> 00:48:46,264
once they fucking hate dryer,
lots of hummingbirds eaten them up to 

1010
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:49,990
do.
We do.

1011
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:50,823
There's not lots of hummingbirds 
anywhere else I've lived like there is 

1012
00:48:52,361 --> 00:48:54,010
here.
We rehabbed a honeybee,

1013
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:56,800
a hummingbird in my house and released 
it.

1014
00:48:56,801 --> 00:49:01,801
We found a girls found a hummingbird 
that was wounded and the,

1015
00:49:01,811 --> 00:49:02,644
uh,
nursed it back to health and then 

1016
00:49:03,701 --> 00:49:04,534
rereleased it in the wild.
We have a little hummingbird feeders in 

1017
00:49:06,551 --> 00:49:07,384
the backyard.

1018
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:08,823
Dude.
Hummingbirds,

1019
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:11,320
the coolest little animals ever.
They're so weird.

1020
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:13,660
I'll put up a video of,
of this hummingbird.

1021
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:14,643
It's so cute.
Like they fed it sugar water life super 

1022
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:19,750
fast,
right?

1023
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:22,390
Dude,
do they fly so fast that you can't,

1024
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:26,890
like if you see it with a stop motion or
slow motion photography,

1025
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:29,950
slow motion videos,
you can't believe how fast it is.

1026
00:49:30,310 --> 00:49:31,000
Like you're,
you're,

1027
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:31,870
you're watching.
You're like,

1028
00:49:31,871 --> 00:49:32,590
Whoa,
look at.

1029
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:33,423
That's insane.
Like what kind of animal evolved like 

1030
00:49:35,621 --> 00:49:39,850
that little tiny wings and they're going
like a fucking billion miles an hour.

1031
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:42,610
Like look at,
look at that thing in slow Mo.

1032
00:49:42,611 --> 00:49:45,880
See if he could find one.
Like there'S no animal like that.

1033
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:47,920
But imagine if an eagle did that.

1034
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:50,793
I'm asking you how fucked everything 
would be if an eagle could move like a 

1035
00:49:55,001 --> 00:49:55,834
hummingbird or just a giant fucking 
giant flying thing with knives for 

1036
00:50:02,021 --> 00:50:07,021
fingers and it's just snatch and fish 
out of water and it's as big as a Turkey

1037
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:10,540
and it moves like a hummingbird.
What the fuck?

1038
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:13,750
Like if you think about that's what a 
tiger is,

1039
00:50:13,751 --> 00:50:17,700
right?
A tiger is a big thing that moves sanely

1040
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:19,240
fast.
Look,

1041
00:50:19,241 --> 00:50:21,700
a little of those wings are too narrow 
and never within their wings to it.

1042
00:50:21,701 --> 00:50:23,680
Now,
do those wines are so small that if they

1043
00:50:23,681 --> 00:50:24,514
were in a superhero,
if I saw a superhero and the body was 

1044
00:50:26,471 --> 00:50:27,980
that big,
the wings without small

1045
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:31,310
tap pitch couldn't fly.
Kid outta here.

1046
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:32,750
That wouldn't even work,
bro.

1047
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:35,080
Dynamically glucose,
small.

1048
00:50:35,081 --> 00:50:37,220
The wings are.
Look how big the body is.

1049
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:40,060
It's fucking stupid.
I click on a little.

1050
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:40,933
Those wings are men.
if you went to like one of those hot 

1051
00:50:45,471 --> 00:50:47,270
wings places and they gave you a wing 
like that,

1052
00:50:47,271 --> 00:50:49,240
you'd be so angry.
Oh hell no.

1053
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:53,510
Release for this is the tiniest little 
wings.

1054
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:56,320
Such a small little animal.
But they're so adorable.

1055
00:50:56,321 --> 00:50:58,670
They have no legs are uh,
they have likes.

1056
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:00,650
Yeah.
It was just tucked in there.

1057
00:51:00,651 --> 00:51:03,010
Tucked into the backseat.
Tiny.

1058
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,810
Yeah.
They're so Beautiful.

1059
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:08,450
Such an unusual little bird to who eats 
them.

1060
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:10,243
Oh,
I'm sure everything that can snack 

1061
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:14,150
dishes,
but I think good luck catching them.

1062
00:51:14,810 --> 00:51:16,250
Good luck catching that little fucker.

1063
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:19,150
I told you I was listening at leonardo 
book the other day and uh,

1064
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:20,223
one of the weird things in the beginning
it mentions is that he had a very weird 

1065
00:51:22,421 --> 00:51:24,970
fascination or it was written in one of 
his notebooks that he wanted to,

1066
00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:29,710
I think it was he wanted to describe the
tongue of a woodpecker would.

1067
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:30,713
This is like an obviously the 14 
hundreds where you'd have to catch the 

1068
00:51:33,911 --> 00:51:35,260
woodpecker,
kill it,

1069
00:51:35,261 --> 00:51:37,600
dissect it,
and then did the description of yourself

1070
00:51:37,601 --> 00:51:39,250
and I guess he does have descriptions of
it,

1071
00:51:39,251 --> 00:51:44,251
which at that time are so descriptive.
You would have to be a scIentist.

1072
00:51:44,291 --> 00:51:45,410
Like he was.
I wonder,

1073
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:46,550
really crazy.
Wow.

1074
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:49,600
You would catch a woodpecker.
How do you catch one of those fuckers?

1075
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:52,660
Know why you would,
how you thought of that was making them.

1076
00:51:53,550 --> 00:51:55,320
Do you think he just shot it out of the 
sky?

1077
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,770
Came up with the trapper of some kind.
I bet,

1078
00:51:58,850 --> 00:51:59,683
I guess.
Right?

1079
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:00,563
Yeah.
Imagine those dudes that were just like 

1080
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:04,253
initially studying species's,
like imagine just like writing down 

1081
00:52:08,581 --> 00:52:11,970
drawing pictures of a cat that you just 
found in the fucking jungle.

1082
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:13,093
Like being one of those guys that 
started the first people to document 

1083
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:19,740
what animals exist out there because 
like how long have we known?

1084
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:23,370
How long have you had a good sense of 
what animals exist out there?

1085
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:26,580
How many years has it been?
You think that people.

1086
00:52:26,581 --> 00:52:29,130
A good sense of all the animals in the 
world.

1087
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:33,210
Like right now we know about giant bears
that live in Russia,

1088
00:52:33,270 --> 00:52:35,430
right?
We know about komodo dragons,

1089
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:39,830
we know about nile crocodiles.
We know about science,

1090
00:52:39,930 --> 00:52:40,763
we know about.
We know about all these animals that 

1091
00:52:41,821 --> 00:52:45,420
exist because we've got all the videos 
and the information,

1092
00:52:45,421 --> 00:52:46,890
but how long has that been a thing?

1093
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:50,490
How long have people known what was in 
all these different spots?

1094
00:52:50,491 --> 00:52:52,830
Has it been 2000 years?
Has it been three?

1095
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,970
How many?
How many thousand years has it been like

1096
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:58,830
reliable information?
No crackings,

1097
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,290
no fucking sea dragons,
you know,

1098
00:53:01,291 --> 00:53:04,410
stop you making shit up.
like what did you really sick?

1099
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:05,273
Like how long has it been where they 
have a detailed account of what animals 

1100
00:53:08,611 --> 00:53:10,200
exist.
I was one of the things he used.

1101
00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:12,130
I don't know the as they've been 
apparent or the hollow,

1102
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:17,150
there've been a pen or something to ride
on hold the first and they have a road.

1103
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:20,580
Wasn't writing I think was like the 
middle east.

1104
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:25,670
I think it was all like sumir and those 
places think that's where they think

1105
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:28,560
it came from.
Do you ever see that writing man,

1106
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:30,240
dude,
it's crazy.

1107
00:53:30,241 --> 00:53:31,890
look,
and it's called cuneiform.

1108
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:33,273
It's like it looks like nails.
It looks like they're like old school 

1109
00:53:36,511 --> 00:53:37,344
lead carpenter nails and they're going 
left and right and up and down the 

1110
00:53:41,341 --> 00:53:42,390
alphabet to.
Yeah,

1111
00:53:42,391 --> 00:53:43,470
look at it.
Oh wow.

1112
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,650
That's,
I think I'm,

1113
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,060
you know,
obviously I'm not an expert,

1114
00:53:48,061 --> 00:53:50,730
but I think they believed this is the 
oldest written language.

1115
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:51,653
See if that's true.
Is cuneiform the oldest written 

1116
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:57,510
language?
They think that was where it started.

1117
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,780
That it started with these little,
uh,

1118
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:04,830
like they look like nails.
Look at that shit dude.

1119
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:06,383
It's such a fantastic looking language 
because it almost looks like some crazy 

1120
00:54:10,651 --> 00:54:11,484
computer coders.
it's funny how all this kind of 

1121
00:54:13,381 --> 00:54:14,214
language,
someone in who's board in prison will 

1122
00:54:16,441 --> 00:54:17,274
pick it up and learn how to write.
Let this with another inmate and give 

1123
00:54:19,891 --> 00:54:21,300
each other messages for the guards.

1124
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:22,500
Wouldn't know.
Look what it says this.

1125
00:54:22,501 --> 00:54:23,610
This is,
this is the one,

1126
00:54:23,611 --> 00:54:24,444
it's called a mil to mil.
I'm the oldest language comes from Sri 

1127
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:31,103
Lanka,
Singapore and to indian states to mill 

1128
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:33,894
is still spoken by approximately 70 
million people across the world to is 

1129
00:54:37,681 --> 00:54:38,514
one of the oldest literary canons of any
knowledge and the world with the 

1130
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:42,923
earliest piece of tamil writing sand 
graham literature dating to 

1131
00:54:46,351 --> 00:54:51,351
approximately 300 bce.
So that's 300 years before current era.

1132
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:54,600
That's not,
that's not super old.

1133
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:56,190
Uh,
see the thing language,

1134
00:54:56,191 --> 00:55:01,191
I think sumerian is susie.
It says sumerian first developed 3,200

1135
00:55:02,011 --> 00:55:02,970
bc.
Okay.

1136
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:04,013
So I think they're saying what's the 
oldest language and is active in the 

1137
00:55:06,241 --> 00:55:09,450
world and that's two mill and that comes
from 300 bc.

1138
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:11,880
But the sumerian language,
yeah.

1139
00:55:11,881 --> 00:55:14,010
Is the oldest shit ever.
So that's what we saw.

1140
00:55:14,011 --> 00:55:14,844
That's cuneiform.
So it was created using a read stylist 

1141
00:55:17,621 --> 00:55:20,970
to make wedge shaped indentations and 
clay tablets.

1142
00:55:21,090 --> 00:55:24,870
So they think as far as they know,
that's the oldest shit.

1143
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:25,770
So that,
that's,

1144
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:31,150
that's only 5,000,
300 something years to develop the,

1145
00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:35,580
to record transactions,
to keep track of money or to talk,

1146
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:36,723
you think.
Which was more important to them at the 

1147
00:55:37,591 --> 00:55:41,760
time transaction would be the two 
probably everything.

1148
00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:43,740
Writing things down.
Try to figure out what,

1149
00:55:44,190 --> 00:55:46,320
what animal did not eat,
you know,

1150
00:55:46,321 --> 00:55:48,330
try to figure out what makes people 
sick.

1151
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:49,950
Keep track of who paid taxes.
We did it.

1152
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:51,510
So 3,200
bc,

1153
00:55:51,511 --> 00:55:55,380
what is that?
That's 5,218

1154
00:55:55,381 --> 00:55:57,180
years ago.
Wow.

1155
00:55:58,950 --> 00:56:02,820
That seems so recent that I love that 
man.

1156
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,150
Five thousand years ago they figured out
how to write shit down.

1157
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:10,080
Like what are you saying?
What did they do before then?

1158
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,180
Wow,
fuck.

1159
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,073
And we're in.
Nobody had raised the more I barely 

1160
00:56:15,661 --> 00:56:16,141
hand,
right.

1161
00:56:16,141 --> 00:56:19,740
I suck at teaching them what I think 
when I write,

1162
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:23,770
I write.
My handwriting deteriorates rapidly with

1163
00:56:23,771 --> 00:56:24,070
every

1164
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:25,930
stroke.
I barely do it anymore.

1165
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:28,090
You still do this?
No,

1166
00:56:28,091 --> 00:56:29,230
I don't.
Logos.

1167
00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:30,123
What does that logo as you do that you 
should do that as in high school when I 

1168
00:56:34,081 --> 00:56:37,050
was bored at the superman logo.
Yeah.

1169
00:56:37,150 --> 00:56:40,270
I used to do all the band names,
like band logos.

1170
00:56:41,990 --> 00:56:43,660
I used to do the v and the,
you know,

1171
00:56:43,661 --> 00:56:44,494
the,
what did a day when we're talking about 

1172
00:56:45,071 --> 00:56:45,904
George Washington.
I saw a fact and I was trying to bring 

1173
00:56:47,951 --> 00:56:48,784
it up in time,
but I had to go back and find it and I 

1174
00:56:50,590 --> 00:56:51,890
just remembered it because.
Well,

1175
00:56:51,891 --> 00:56:52,724
what you're talking about,
do you know when the first dinosaur 

1176
00:56:55,001 --> 00:56:57,070
bones were discovered?
Dude,

1177
00:56:57,071 --> 00:57:02,071
we talked about this once a.
I don't remember what it was more recent

1178
00:57:02,441 --> 00:57:03,274
than something like that.
I don't know if he was already 

1179
00:57:06,461 --> 00:57:07,960
president,
done with all of that.

1180
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:09,023
All.
Everything that they had written and 

1181
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:10,160
talked about.

1182
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:14,050
Everything we'd go back and discuss was 
all before they even knew like dinosaurs

1183
00:57:14,051 --> 00:57:15,790
even existed almost.
Yeah.

1184
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:17,290
Yeah.
Clearly crazy.

1185
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:18,640
Yeah.
It is really crazy.

1186
00:57:19,530 --> 00:57:22,480
It's hard to believe that.
We mean imagine you have like,

1187
00:57:22,550 --> 00:57:24,850
okay,
we think we got an understanding of what

1188
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:27,930
is here and what's been here.
It's probably been similar to what he,

1189
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:29,493
what the fuck is this?
And they find a bone that's as big as a 

1190
00:57:32,201 --> 00:57:33,290
bus.
It was like,

1191
00:57:33,310 --> 00:57:36,400
wait a minute,
what the fuck is this?

1192
00:57:36,770 --> 00:57:37,960
That's what it would have freaked me 
out,

1193
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:40,390
dude.
you imagined you find a bone as big as a

1194
00:57:40,391 --> 00:57:43,750
bus and you're like,
holy shit,

1195
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:46,960
this is one animal.
What is this?

1196
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,410
This is a leg.
what?

1197
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,133
He keeps getting bigger and bigger 
pieces and then you realize you have a 

1198
00:57:53,351 --> 00:57:56,380
brontosaurus.
Just imagine finding all that shit,

1199
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:57,393
not knowing it exists and going,
what the fuck is this thing that looks 

1200
00:58:00,821 --> 00:58:04,280
like a rib and what is this thing and 
that noise,

1201
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:05,530
how big the world is.

1202
00:58:05,530 --> 00:58:06,363
So you'd think of.
There's another one around the world 

1203
00:58:07,251 --> 00:58:08,410
that they live.
Yeah.

1204
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,000
Oh yeah man,
for a lot.

1205
00:58:10,090 --> 00:58:10,923
You know,
they sent david spade or david spade 

1206
00:58:13,070 --> 00:58:14,500
christ.
They spent david choe.

1207
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:18,000
They sent david cho to the Congo and 
advice.

1208
00:58:18,010 --> 00:58:18,843
This is how I found out about dave.
They they sent it and then I found out 

1209
00:58:22,001 --> 00:58:26,170
about him again from bordain was telling
me how amazing is they?

1210
00:58:26,250 --> 00:58:29,410
They sent david's show.
David cho was already rich at the time.

1211
00:58:29,411 --> 00:58:32,770
This whole crazy david cho is.
He was wealthy as fuck.

1212
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:35,470
Like he didn't have to do anything,
he'd already made a gang of money,

1213
00:58:35,471 --> 00:58:36,304
like gambling and shit,
and he decides to go down to the Congo 

1214
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:43,840
to go looking for a fucking dinosaur 
man.

1215
00:58:43,841 --> 00:58:46,750
It's the craziest episode of vice 
because these people,

1216
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:47,793
some people that lived there,
or at least they're saying they're 

1217
00:58:49,751 --> 00:58:50,780
convinced that there's.

1218
00:58:50,830 --> 00:58:51,663
I mean,
they could be just fucking with white 

1219
00:58:52,541 --> 00:58:54,250
people.
That could be a thing too,

1220
00:58:54,251 --> 00:58:55,430
right?
Which could,

1221
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:56,283
could be fucking with westerners.
Some korean kid comes by and they're 

1222
00:58:59,471 --> 00:58:59,771
like,
yeah,

1223
00:58:59,771 --> 00:59:00,311
yeah,
yeah.

1224
00:59:00,311 --> 00:59:01,144
I'll show her the fucking thing.
I was going to add about the davinci 

1225
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:03,753
thing.
He used to fuck with his friends with 

1226
00:59:04,341 --> 00:59:06,460
the lizard dressed up like a little baby
dragon.

1227
00:59:06,730 --> 00:59:09,010
And he'd freak them out and like,
look what I look what I found.

1228
00:59:09,011 --> 00:59:11,230
Look what I got.
Davinci did that.

1229
00:59:11,270 --> 00:59:13,310
You'd have to believe him because he's 
fucking davinci,

1230
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:15,040
right?
That's hilarious.

1231
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:18,720
Add things to creatures.
Pretend he's made a new space,

1232
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:20,200
a new,
found a new species.

1233
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:21,733
Look at dave.
He was young as fuck to men is a long 

1234
00:59:25,221 --> 00:59:27,280
ass time ago.
And uh,

1235
00:59:27,650 --> 00:59:28,483
he went to the jungle wet looking for 
these supposedly bronto sources that 

1236
00:59:34,701 --> 00:59:37,090
people see in the jungle.
Can you imagine?

1237
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:39,020
They found one.
I mean,

1238
00:59:39,021 --> 00:59:43,340
there's not enough jungle to hide like 
someone else credible.

1239
00:59:43,670 --> 00:59:45,740
Someone will get a picture.
Everyone has a phone now.

1240
00:59:45,741 --> 00:59:47,350
Even people that live in the jungle.
Right.

1241
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:49,790
What would it hide?
It would hide in the jungle.

1242
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:55,640
He would have a dam or a cave in the 
water.

1243
00:59:55,670 --> 01:00:00,670
You would have to be an enormous area 
where people never go for a big thing to

1244
01:00:01,941 --> 01:00:03,770
be alive today that people don't know 
about.

1245
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:07,040
Like,
they'll find like a new dear,

1246
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:09,170
you know,
they'll find a new dear sometimes like,

1247
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:09,831
oh,
look aT this.

1248
01:00:09,831 --> 01:00:10,970
We've got a new frog.
Yeah,

1249
01:00:10,971 --> 01:00:12,920
we found a new dear.
This is incredible.

1250
01:00:12,921 --> 01:00:15,290
It's in the jungles of Cambodia.
It's a new.

1251
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:16,183
It's a subspecies of this deer.
Rare footage shows the last surviving 

1252
01:00:19,191 --> 01:00:22,390
member of an uncontacted uncontacted 
amazon tribe.

1253
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,870
Yeah.
I saw this support,

1254
01:00:23,871 --> 01:00:26,570
dude.
He's the last of the mohicans.

1255
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:28,220
That's meanwhile.
That's a camera man.

1256
01:00:28,430 --> 01:00:30,680
That's a camera man.
They fucking gave him 50 bucks.

1257
01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:33,380
Just go out there and beats of trees.
I'm going to get some footage.

1258
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:36,440
It looks like blair witch project and 
have you just whack it against a tree.

1259
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:38,300
I'm going to say you the last surviving.
We're bro.

1260
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:41,030
We're going to get paid for this.
Come on bro.

1261
01:00:41,031 --> 01:00:43,910
You look like an old fucking guy that 
lives in the jungle.

1262
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:45,920
Just do it.
50 bucks.

1263
01:00:45,921 --> 01:00:47,480
Do.
I'll give you 50 bucks.

1264
01:00:47,481 --> 01:00:48,314
What else are you going to do today?
Since they've been tracking them since 

1265
01:00:49,971 --> 01:00:51,630
the nineties.
That's crazy.

1266
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,590
We live in by himself since the 
nineties.

1267
01:00:55,970 --> 01:00:57,650
We got a weird problem with that,
right?

1268
01:00:57,710 --> 01:00:59,360
Like wow,
poor guy.

1269
01:00:59,870 --> 01:01:00,703
What if he dies out there like that when
he's going to die here in a different 

1270
01:01:02,361 --> 01:01:03,860
way?
What are you talking about?

1271
01:01:04,350 --> 01:01:07,760
Whom he status living alone.
If he's sad,

1272
01:01:07,761 --> 01:01:08,800
he's sad.
If he,

1273
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:10,340
you knoW,
he saw those people with cameras.

1274
01:01:10,341 --> 01:01:11,870
He probably chase out and with a blow 
dart,

1275
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,420
you know,
if he embraced it,

1276
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:18,530
just thought what a way to go.
Got himself a nice pair of nike's,

1277
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:21,240
you know,
gucci fanny pack or what?

1278
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:25,340
I come out of the woods,
bro.

1279
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:30,960
He shot at someone at 2005 or you're 
wounded someone into with it.

1280
01:01:32,930 --> 01:01:34,190
Oh fuck.
Yeah.

1281
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:35,210
You don't want that,
man.

1282
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:36,680
That guy is going to shoot arrows at 
you.

1283
01:01:37,310 --> 01:01:38,143
Imagine that he's a criminaL.
They haven't even gone and gotten them 

1284
01:01:40,310 --> 01:01:42,200
shooting arrows at people.
You son of a bitch.

1285
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:43,940
Let's do.
They didn't want.

1286
01:01:44,030 --> 01:01:48,230
He didn't want them to get saved,
but it's funny,

1287
01:01:48,231 --> 01:01:49,064
man.
We look at people that live in a way 

1288
01:01:49,851 --> 01:01:51,290
that's different than the way we live.
Like,

1289
01:01:51,291 --> 01:01:52,250
oh,
we got to save them.

1290
01:01:52,890 --> 01:01:53,723
We got to save him.
We got to bring them over to the good 

1291
01:01:55,131 --> 01:01:56,660
side.
I know we got to save him,

1292
01:01:56,661 --> 01:01:58,740
but someone living in their car,
he's paya.

1293
01:01:59,000 --> 01:01:59,990
Yeah,
yeah,

1294
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:01,790
yeah,
man.

1295
01:02:01,790 --> 01:02:02,860
Someone living in their car,
fine.

1296
01:02:02,870 --> 01:02:03,703
Until the guy.
That guy that's camping under the 

1297
01:02:04,761 --> 01:02:06,350
freeway.
Normal,

1298
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:08,800
normal,
super normal.

1299
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:12,430
There was a guy living across the street
from my house.

1300
01:02:12,570 --> 01:02:15,320
I live in echo park.
He will live in instead of a bogle.

1301
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:17,690
Whoa.
Here's the thing,

1302
01:02:17,691 --> 01:02:18,440
right?
They don't.

1303
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:23,250
They let american tribes controlled 
giant chunks of land.

1304
01:02:23,251 --> 01:02:28,251
they give them reservations in the 18,
whatever it was was like 18,

1305
01:02:28,291 --> 01:02:31,550
65 or some shit where they did all this.
The wars land never took,

1306
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:34,440
nothing grows and they didn't want.
They didn't get many of the good spots,

1307
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:36,630
so they give.
They give them all like think.

1308
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,380
when did that happen?
Let's find out first.

1309
01:02:40,410 --> 01:02:45,410
That was my question was would you ever 
allow them to live the much of tears,

1310
01:02:48,721 --> 01:02:50,220
right?
What is it?

1311
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:51,113
18,
87,

1312
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:53,040
87.
Wow,

1313
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:53,903
that's crazy.
But would they allow them to live like 

1314
01:02:57,751 --> 01:03:00,060
they lived before?
The europeans intervened,

1315
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:01,073
like if you really just left them alone 
and they live like fucking horseback 

1316
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:07,890
trading,
you know,

1317
01:03:07,891 --> 01:03:12,840
animals for bullets is really low like 
they lived back then.

1318
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:16,710
Indian land for sale find lands in the 
west.

1319
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:19,170
This is a crazy.
Add grazing.

1320
01:03:19,330 --> 01:03:24,210
Have your own easy payments.
Perfect.

1321
01:03:24,211 --> 01:03:27,390

1322
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:31,020
Indian land for sale.

1323
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:32,063
Yes.
This is A real ad that they had back 

1324
01:03:33,571 --> 01:03:34,404
then.
Brassica studies from Nebraska as 

1325
01:03:35,961 --> 01:03:36,970
website,

1326
01:03:37,890 --> 01:03:40,980
this is,
this is the next art for the studio.

1327
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:43,530
We need that.
We need that.

1328
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:45,520
That needs to.
That enforced.

1329
01:03:45,610 --> 01:03:47,700
They'll make a reservation.
Yeah.

1330
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:52,110
We need that framed on the wall.
How much there is a bigger the land.

1331
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:57,800
That's what we need.
We need that framed to that.

1332
01:03:57,871 --> 01:03:59,160
Ain't that long ago,
man.

1333
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:02,700
That is not that long ago.
That is a crazy thing.

1334
01:04:02,701 --> 01:04:03,181
It's like,
look,

1335
01:04:03,181 --> 01:04:05,940
we captured this shit from these people 
that will sell it to you.

1336
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:09,030
Who wants to buy it?
There's a picture of the dude we jacked.

1337
01:04:09,090 --> 01:04:11,010
They got a picture of the dude they 
checked.

1338
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:14,520
There's a previous owner.
This is the previous owner.

1339
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:17,610
Look at that.
$20 an acre in Wyoming.

1340
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:20,040
Do you think that they had an acre?
How much of that?

1341
01:04:20,041 --> 01:04:22,470
No.
$20 an acre.

1342
01:04:22,950 --> 01:04:25,470
Wow.
Do that right now.

1343
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:27,450
I mean it depends on where it is.
If it's in beverly hills,

1344
01:04:27,451 --> 01:04:30,900
that's why we $14 million or $15 an 
acre.

1345
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:34,140
15 bucks and acre in Oregon and here's 
the.

1346
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:35,413
But look at the dude that got the dude.
They got like the most regal looking 

1347
01:04:38,881 --> 01:04:43,881
native american looks like a chief.
Let's look at his image.

1348
01:04:44,670 --> 01:04:47,860
Perfect fuck.
Like a perfect representation of like a,

1349
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:49,050
an elder.
Like,

1350
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:49,980
uh,
a wise,

1351
01:04:50,010 --> 01:04:53,010
powerful old indian like a chief,
right?

1352
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:54,780
He looks like the dude they be running 
shit.

1353
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:59,020
like we got it from this dude.
We got the prime cuts baby.

1354
01:04:59,340 --> 01:05:00,173
Huh?
We got the fucking tomahawk ribeye with 

1355
01:05:03,481 --> 01:05:05,310
the bone.
Come on bro.

1356
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:10,110
For you indian land the best.
Nothing but the best.

1357
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:11,670
We got it off that guy.
Look at him.

1358
01:05:12,380 --> 01:05:14,820
We said the highest guy on the totem 
pole.

1359
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:18,280
Could you imagine if there's parts of 
this country where decided

1360
01:05:18,310 --> 01:05:22,150
to live like the native americans live 
straight up,

1361
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:25,450
full stop.
They wore animal skins.

1362
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:26,200
They,
they,

1363
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:30,280
they tanned from shooting them with bows
and arrows.

1364
01:05:30,490 --> 01:05:31,323
They made their own bows and arrows.
They did everything the way that the 

1365
01:05:34,001 --> 01:05:36,340
people did before the europeans arrived.
They say,

1366
01:05:36,341 --> 01:05:39,010
fuck your technology.
Fuck your laws.

1367
01:05:39,011 --> 01:05:41,560
Fuck your bullshit.
Just give us a fertile,

1368
01:05:42,430 --> 01:05:46,510
gigantic swath of land that we could 
live like we live before.

1369
01:05:46,511 --> 01:05:49,360
And then people just gravitate to that.
Do you know how crazy that would be?

1370
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,780
People would fuck it up though.
They would do a reality show of it.

1371
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:54,760
They would have certain.
Some of the horses were,

1372
01:05:54,761 --> 01:05:55,594
have like fucking cameras and you see 
the fucking westworld and dick's 

1373
01:05:59,770 --> 01:06:00,603
flopping out a loin cloth and people 
would have to kill people the way they 

1374
01:06:03,161 --> 01:06:05,800
killed people back then too.
They'd have to have tools aNd cit.

1375
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:07,810
Scalpel,
I think.

1376
01:06:07,990 --> 01:06:10,030
I don't know who.
Who invented scalping.

1377
01:06:10,530 --> 01:06:11,363
Do you think scalping was invented by 
the native americans or was it invented 

1378
01:06:13,991 --> 01:06:15,640
by the white people?
By the white people?

1379
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:16,751
They,
uh,

1380
01:06:16,751 --> 01:06:18,100
we covered this.
I used to collect them.

1381
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:19,580
Yeah.
These bag.

1382
01:06:19,790 --> 01:06:21,400
What was it?
Their idea first?

1383
01:06:21,430 --> 01:06:22,263
I'm wondering whose idea it was first 
because sometimes some of the shit that 

1384
01:06:24,610 --> 01:06:25,960
people do in war,
you know,

1385
01:06:25,961 --> 01:06:28,850
they'll,
they'll copy shit from the enemy to like

1386
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:30,190
enemies doing it.
They'll day,

1387
01:06:30,191 --> 01:06:32,650
uh,
we'll fucking do it was a bit of birth.

1388
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:33,800
Oh,
he,

1389
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:36,130
he did the worst shit of all time.
Brutal.

1390
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:37,353
Give her a listen to that dan carlin 
hardcore history series to after the 

1391
01:06:42,221 --> 01:06:44,620
show I'm going to send to you gotta.
listen to it.

1392
01:06:44,621 --> 01:06:45,454
It's nuts if you've got the time because
it's like five parts and you get sucked 

1393
01:06:49,630 --> 01:06:50,463
in,
but it just shows you how insane that 

1394
01:06:52,751 --> 01:06:57,190
guy and his family were and what the 
empire that he created.

1395
01:06:57,610 --> 01:06:58,443
This one guy,
his real name is too much and they had 

1396
01:07:02,471 --> 01:07:04,290
all kinds of shit.
They had catapults,

1397
01:07:04,590 --> 01:07:07,000
light human bodies on fire.
They would.

1398
01:07:07,070 --> 01:07:10,360
They will do a quick as shooting 
airwatch horseback.

1399
01:07:10,361 --> 01:07:11,860
Right?
That's what saved them.

1400
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:13,870
Well,
that was one of their strategies,

1401
01:07:13,871 --> 01:07:17,650
but they were extremely stout people.
They were very,

1402
01:07:17,651 --> 01:07:19,210
very strong people.
Apparently.

1403
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:22,450
All I know about that.
I'll just full disclosure.

1404
01:07:22,451 --> 01:07:23,284
All I know about is what I learned from 
dan carlin's hardcore history podcast 

1405
01:07:25,781 --> 01:07:26,614
and like a couple of articles.
I've never really read that much about 

1406
01:07:28,841 --> 01:07:32,560
the mongols,
but what he said was that they had these

1407
01:07:32,561 --> 01:07:35,920
bows that required 160 pounds to pull 
back,

1408
01:07:35,921 --> 01:07:36,754
which is just insane.
So they must be shooting heavier arrows 

1409
01:07:40,721 --> 01:07:43,480
that could kill people better than 
anything.

1410
01:07:43,481 --> 01:07:44,314
The smaller people or the weaker people 
would would possess and they were a 

1411
01:07:47,951 --> 01:07:50,630
nomadic horse people,
so they were traveling around,

1412
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:53,530
living in tents like they despise people
that live in cities.

1413
01:07:53,860 --> 01:07:54,693
They were just the strongest,
most ruthless army the world has ever 

1414
01:07:57,791 --> 01:08:00,370
seen at the time like nobody had ever 
seen anything like this.

1415
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:03,010
They would just.
They killed millions of people.

1416
01:08:03,011 --> 01:08:06,550
They thInk New York times had an article
that said they killed so many people.

1417
01:08:06,551 --> 01:08:09,370
They change the carbon footprint of the 
earth.

1418
01:08:09,610 --> 01:08:12,670
There was less people,
a noticeable number.

1419
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:13,504
If you go and you look through the ice 
core samples and they are starting to 

1420
01:08:16,311 --> 01:08:17,144
attributed,
or some people at least are attributing 

1421
01:08:18,351 --> 01:08:19,184
that to gingiss con killing some 
somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 

1422
01:08:21,711 --> 01:08:24,920
percent of the population on earth.
The one out of 10,

1423
01:08:25,010 --> 01:08:27,560
he killed more people than aids.
Yeah,

1424
01:08:27,561 --> 01:08:28,394
definitely.
Right?

1425
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:30,260
How many people didn't get killed?
If you had to guess,

1426
01:08:31,790 --> 01:08:33,440
someone was just talking about that 
recently and say,

1427
01:08:33,441 --> 01:08:37,340
no one should die from hiv anymore.
No one should die of aids.

1428
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:39,260
It literally shouldn't have to happen 
anymore,

1429
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:42,980
and that crazy.
This take medication.

1430
01:08:42,981 --> 01:08:45,080
Now.
We were kids,

1431
01:08:45,081 --> 01:08:45,914
everybody was terrified to aids.
Aids was a death sentence while eating 

1432
01:08:48,831 --> 01:08:51,590
twinkies,
terrified of aids while eating the thing

1433
01:08:51,591 --> 01:08:54,620
that's slowly killing you.
Terrified to get into aids.

1434
01:08:54,790 --> 01:08:55,623
A little kid gets it.
Everybody will want to go to school no 

1435
01:08:57,231 --> 01:09:00,200
more.
Remember that one kid go to school?

1436
01:09:00,740 --> 01:09:02,280
Yeah,
the magic god in there,

1437
01:09:02,281 --> 01:09:03,114
but they will.
All right.

1438
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:05,090
Magic.
Got it.

1439
01:09:05,150 --> 01:09:07,880
I remember being in my car.
I was in my car.

1440
01:09:07,881 --> 01:09:11,420
I was living in revere Massachusetts.
Rear.

1441
01:09:11,530 --> 01:09:12,310
Yeah.
This,

1442
01:09:12,310 --> 01:09:13,143
uh,
apartment complex and I was driving my 

1443
01:09:17,091 --> 01:09:17,924
car and I was on the high.
I was on the road listening to the 

1444
01:09:20,841 --> 01:09:21,591
radio.
Like,

1445
01:09:21,591 --> 01:09:23,720
you know,
you see where the traffic lights are.

1446
01:09:23,870 --> 01:09:24,703
You see,
you see,

1447
01:09:24,770 --> 01:09:26,690
you remember it's like burned in your 
brain.

1448
01:09:26,691 --> 01:09:27,540
like,
ah,

1449
01:09:27,860 --> 01:09:29,630
magic johnson has aids.

1450
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:32,180
What in my car?
What's,

1451
01:09:32,570 --> 01:09:33,403
what's out?
I remember thinking like it was a scene 

1452
01:09:34,821 --> 01:09:38,630
in a vampire movie monster movie or 
something like a zombie outbreak.

1453
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:39,920
Like,
oh my god,

1454
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:43,820
now it's reached one of the greatest 
basketball players of all time.

1455
01:09:43,821 --> 01:09:44,654
this is insane.
Are people going to just start dropping 

1456
01:09:46,881 --> 01:09:49,040
off like flies?
Now we're going to start,

1457
01:09:49,490 --> 01:09:50,323
please just,
I wouldn't condoms right away 

1458
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:53,180
afterwards.
I don't think so.

1459
01:09:53,810 --> 01:09:55,130
We need,
you know,

1460
01:09:57,350 --> 01:09:59,930
animals bro.
Savage,

1461
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:00,953
savage.
I mean there's a reason why there's 7 

1462
01:10:02,270 --> 01:10:03,103
billion of us.
We stop.

1463
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:07,550
People need to stop pretending that when
they're fully,

1464
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:11,330
fully aroused that they're thinking 
straight like you,

1465
01:10:11,331 --> 01:10:15,650
you are operating at about 10 percent of
your normal resources like aids,

1466
01:10:15,651 --> 01:10:16,830
whatever.
Who's got a.

1467
01:10:18,730 --> 01:10:21,260
He's still got a little bit with the 
code.

1468
01:10:22,150 --> 01:10:24,060
Will the,
you know,

1469
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:25,453
it's crazy that it was just primarily 
gay people in drug users that we're 

1470
01:10:29,361 --> 01:10:31,670
getting it.
That's what a weird disease man.

1471
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:34,310
That's a.
That's a weird one man.

1472
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:36,433
That's a strange thing when your body 
starts weakening and shutting down like 

1473
01:10:39,951 --> 01:10:40,784
whoa.
But when you really think about the 

1474
01:10:42,561 --> 01:10:43,394
actual danger and death,
like I think even while aids was in its 

1475
01:10:47,811 --> 01:10:48,644
height of killing people,
I don't think it was killing people as 

1476
01:10:51,741 --> 01:10:53,180
much as the flu was right.

1477
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:57,670
The numbers I'm finding now or depending
on worldwide or us.

1478
01:10:58,210 --> 01:10:59,043
So worldwide,
tuberculosis is now killing more people 

1479
01:11:01,391 --> 01:11:04,960
than aids.
But this says that only one point,

1480
01:11:04,961 --> 01:11:09,640
1 million people today in the us are 
living with aids and I think I saw,

1481
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:10,593
but living with aids,
it's like you're at the border of 

1482
01:11:12,641 --> 01:11:14,730
getting aids.
Is that what it is?

1483
01:11:14,731 --> 01:11:15,390
It's liKe,
yeah,

1484
01:11:15,390 --> 01:11:19,320
you have h supposedly this again,
I'm not a dOctor.

1485
01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:22,050
Right.
Supposedly it's like you have hiv,

1486
01:11:22,330 --> 01:11:26,850
your immune system gets weakened.
You catch aids,

1487
01:11:26,851 --> 01:11:28,830
which is acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome,

1488
01:11:28,831 --> 01:11:29,664
which means your t cell levels have 
reached a certain count where they 

1489
01:11:31,531 --> 01:11:33,180
identify it as aids,
right?

1490
01:11:33,450 --> 01:11:34,283
Yeah.
IT actually did type in a tennis is 

1491
01:11:35,341 --> 01:11:38,790
going to hiv.
So that's.

1492
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:40,013
They're definitely connected.
So it's not people that also their 

1493
01:11:42,181 --> 01:11:44,700
immune system fails.
That's outside of hiv.

1494
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,260
This.
So I clicked on this.

1495
01:11:46,261 --> 01:11:48,360
I'll share what I clicked on.
So I typed in that end,

1496
01:11:48,361 --> 01:11:50,940
and this is showing this.
It says at one point 2 million people,

1497
01:11:50,941 --> 01:11:53,910
I received an aids diagnosis since the 
early eighties.

1498
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,880
Since the early eighties.
Okay.

1499
01:11:57,180 --> 01:12:01,860
So 1 million people.
And there have been 12,000

1500
01:12:01,861 --> 01:12:03,900
in 2014.
There were 12,000,

1501
01:12:03,930 --> 01:12:04,763
333 deaths due to any cause of people 
with diagnosed hiv infection ever 

1502
01:12:12,331 --> 01:12:16,950
classified as aids and what does that 
mean then at $6?

1503
01:12:16,951 --> 01:12:19,950
A weird way of saying it with people.
I'll say it again.

1504
01:12:20,190 --> 01:12:21,023
It says there were 12,000,
333 deaths due to any cause of people 

1505
01:12:24,481 --> 01:12:28,770
with diagnosed hiv infection.
Ever classified as aids.

1506
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:33,630
Isn't that a strange way of saying that?
Yeah.

1507
01:12:35,450 --> 01:12:36,283
With the.
I don't know what that immedion could 

1508
01:12:36,890 --> 01:12:39,800
lose the declassification if your immune
system gets strong enough.

1509
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:40,693
I don't know.
It says with diagnosed hiv infection 

1510
01:12:42,921 --> 01:12:44,720
ever classified as aids.

1511
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:47,270
Okay.
Are the.

1512
01:12:47,310 --> 01:12:48,143
I don't know,
mayBe I'm too stupid for that because 

1513
01:12:48,951 --> 01:12:51,560
what I also saw was that a million 
people died last year from it,

1514
01:12:51,561 --> 01:12:52,394
but that'd be worldwide and this then 
contradicts because it says a million 

1515
01:12:54,741 --> 01:12:58,070
people have only been diagnosed and this
is only in the us and that other numbers

1516
01:12:58,071 --> 01:12:58,904
worldwide.
So it gets really sketchy anD it says 

1517
01:13:00,201 --> 01:13:04,190
6,721
deaths were attributed directly to hiv.

1518
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:06,930
Yeah.
So it seems that they,

1519
01:13:07,670 --> 01:13:09,860
they definitely think it's still killing
people.

1520
01:13:10,730 --> 01:13:14,030
Definitely still is tuberculosis.
But what is,

1521
01:13:14,270 --> 01:13:16,400
how many people die from the flu every 
year?

1522
01:13:19,090 --> 01:13:20,320
What?
What do you would you think would be the

1523
01:13:20,321 --> 01:13:21,850
most?
The most ruthless,

1524
01:13:21,851 --> 01:13:24,940
normal killer would be the flu.
The flu would kill the most people.

1525
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:26,253
Thirty 6,000.
Way more way more people Got jacked by 

1526
01:13:29,831 --> 01:13:33,040
the flu every year.
Every year.

1527
01:13:33,970 --> 01:13:36,670
And what was the number from the aids 
number was total,

1528
01:13:36,671 --> 01:13:37,504
right.
How many of those people that flu shots 

1529
01:13:39,191 --> 01:13:40,300
though?
What is it?

1530
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:44,500
Two thousand 14.
So it's a third or so.

1531
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:45,933
So what's the third aids to the flu?
Aids is about one slash third of the 

1532
01:13:49,271 --> 01:13:54,271
deaths of the flu per year on average.
I don't know if I'm that interesting.

1533
01:13:55,120 --> 01:14:00,120
It's like we're not scared of the thing 
that kills us way more.

1534
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:01,113
We're really scared of the thing that 
kills less people because it kills them 

1535
01:14:03,611 --> 01:14:08,070
through butts.
That's what it is.

1536
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:09,153
It has to be.
We're terrified that it kills people 

1537
01:14:10,871 --> 01:14:11,704
through

1538
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:12,903
because like the flu,
it seems like we should really be 

1539
01:14:14,681 --> 01:14:17,530
concentrating on that thing.
That thing's killing way more people.

1540
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:21,670
People not washing their hands,
but they're like,

1541
01:14:21,671 --> 01:14:23,500
look,
we can't stop that,

1542
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:26,530
but we can stop all of his buttocks.
Weird.

1543
01:14:26,531 --> 01:14:29,500
Right.
It's weird like when we have.

1544
01:14:29,570 --> 01:14:30,403
Maybe it's just because it's a new thing
that was kiLling people because it 

1545
01:14:32,651 --> 01:14:35,680
didn't exist and then it did exist.
That's probably what it is,

1546
01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:37,360
right?
Like,

1547
01:14:37,870 --> 01:14:38,703
yeah,
because it came out of nowhere because 

1548
01:14:39,611 --> 01:14:42,280
it was in like,
what was it during the eighties?

1549
01:14:42,870 --> 01:14:44,570
Yeah.
Murphy said,

1550
01:14:44,590 --> 01:14:46,180
and you're walking around with the a's 
on your lip.

1551
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:47,650
Oh,
was that,

1552
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:48,483
was that delirious?
Do you remember sam kennison his bid on 

1553
01:14:50,741 --> 01:14:52,450
it.
He goes,

1554
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:55,220
they say sam shouldn't make fun of aids 
aid.

1555
01:14:55,221 --> 01:14:57,790
Sam Is a communicable disease.
Straight people can get it to.

1556
01:14:57,791 --> 01:14:59,020
He goes,
no,

1557
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:02,980
it's not our dad's.

1558
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:08,460
He had this crazy dangerous bit about it
and like way back then like,

1559
01:15:09,580 --> 01:15:13,540
whoa.
It's like a cro in around like 1980.

1560
01:15:13,541 --> 01:15:14,680
I don't know if that's accurate,
but.

1561
01:15:14,830 --> 01:15:17,490
So 1980 was the highest peak.
Maybe it's in thousands.

1562
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:19,470
So yeah,
it seems like low.

1563
01:15:19,530 --> 01:15:22,270
So it seems like it seems like late 
seventies,

1564
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:24,610
right?
Is that somewhere around 1980?

1565
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:27,100
The one thing too,
I read that there's around 300,000

1566
01:15:27,101 --> 01:15:29,110
total deaths and a third of them are in 
New York,

1567
01:15:30,010 --> 01:15:31,930
300,000
total deaths,

1568
01:15:31,931 --> 01:15:35,860
a third in New York and the flute and 
this is all told ever.

1569
01:15:37,150 --> 01:15:39,370
Again,
just the stats are all multiple pages.

1570
01:15:39,450 --> 01:15:40,283
So here's how many of the.
See I get so confused about all this 

1571
01:15:43,601 --> 01:15:44,434
shit because uh,
some people believe that a lot of these 

1572
01:15:47,591 --> 01:15:48,424
people also were shooting heroin.
A lot of these people were also doing a 

1573
01:15:51,101 --> 01:15:53,530
lot of drugs.
I would wonder,

1574
01:15:53,531 --> 01:15:55,660
you know,
if they're really partying hard and they

1575
01:15:55,661 --> 01:15:56,650
also get aids,
I would,

1576
01:15:56,740 --> 01:15:57,573
I would always wonder like how much of 
you partying hard is destroying your 

1577
01:16:01,841 --> 01:16:02,800
immune system too.

1578
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,720
LIke if you're,
if you have a disease,

1579
01:16:04,721 --> 01:16:05,554
like say you have cancer and you're 
struggling with cancer and you just 

1580
01:16:09,071 --> 01:16:13,390
decided to hardcore start smoking meth 
and then you die from the cancer.

1581
01:16:13,930 --> 01:16:15,340
Like is it,
isn't,

1582
01:16:15,341 --> 01:16:18,070
didn't something else kill you too.
Right?

1583
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:20,890
Not saying that the cancer's good for 
you,

1584
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:22,360
cancer,
certainly bad for you,

1585
01:16:22,690 --> 01:16:23,523
but if you have cancer and just decided 
to go on a meth binge and destroy your 

1586
01:16:26,921 --> 01:16:29,980
immune system,
it's got to contribute to your health,

1587
01:16:30,010 --> 01:16:32,140
but we don't consider that.
We will consider up.

1588
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:33,730
They'll fucking cancer.
Got him.

1589
01:16:33,940 --> 01:16:34,773
Cancer.
Got him.

1590
01:16:34,870 --> 01:16:36,970
It did get him.
He definitely did get them,

1591
01:16:36,971 --> 01:16:41,350
but he was also smoke and math all day.
Feeling good.

1592
01:16:41,410 --> 01:16:45,040
Doing robberies or robberies with 
fucking skulls.

1593
01:16:45,041 --> 01:16:47,200
Painted out.
It's 7:11.

1594
01:16:47,890 --> 01:16:50,830
He was amped.
Dude was amped with cancer.

1595
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:52,220
That's.
That's also.

1596
01:16:52,221 --> 01:16:53,054
I mean if he dies of a heart attack,
like all the cancer gave him a heart 

1597
01:16:55,001 --> 01:16:55,750
attack.
Yeah,

1598
01:16:55,750 --> 01:16:56,583
probably.
That probably had something to do with 

1599
01:16:57,191 --> 01:16:59,260
it.
DefInitely was not good.

1600
01:16:59,290 --> 01:17:00,123
It's definitely not good to have cancer,
but it's also not good to be smoking 

1601
01:17:02,231 --> 01:17:03,064
meth while you have cancer smoking bad.
So how many of these people that got 

1602
01:17:07,361 --> 01:17:10,520
aids were like extremely healthy folks

1603
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:11,593
that like jogged on a regular basis and 
ate a lot of fruit and vegetables are 

1604
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:18,350
hard to get that data.
I know I would like to get that data.

1605
01:17:18,351 --> 01:17:20,150
This is not like a prejudice 
perspective.

1606
01:17:20,151 --> 01:17:20,984
I'm just as a curious person,
I would like to get all that I would 

1607
01:17:23,661 --> 01:17:25,610
like to know.
What is it that actually does it?

1608
01:17:26,210 --> 01:17:27,170
Is it,
um,

1609
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:31,820
is it the method kills you?
Is it a disease that kills you?

1610
01:17:31,821 --> 01:17:35,060
Is it a combination of all these things?
We always want to attribute death to one

1611
01:17:35,061 --> 01:17:35,894
thing,
but I would imagine that with all the 

1612
01:17:39,501 --> 01:17:42,800
people that have died of the flu,
there's a number of deaths.

1613
01:17:42,890 --> 01:17:43,880
When you look at the fluid,
you're like,

1614
01:17:43,881 --> 01:17:46,310
man,
that the flu could just catch you.

1615
01:17:46,780 --> 01:17:50,960
The flu could just catch you and you 
catch you when you're already week two,

1616
01:17:51,020 --> 01:17:52,600
maybe your,
your rundown,

1617
01:17:52,610 --> 01:17:54,680
you've been working too much and then 
the flu hits you.

1618
01:17:54,710 --> 01:17:58,670
When your immune system's devastated and
it gets deep into you and gets you.

1619
01:17:59,090 --> 01:18:00,770
Everybody's vulnerable.
I mean,

1620
01:18:00,771 --> 01:18:03,070
the thing about diseases that's so 
strange to me,

1621
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:03,913
so some of them are associated with 
certain certain groups of people like 

1622
01:18:07,161 --> 01:18:07,994
aids,
aids is one of those ones is just so 

1623
01:18:09,771 --> 01:18:10,604
associated with gay people that it's 
like a really politically charged 

1624
01:18:13,221 --> 01:18:16,400
disease and we concentrate on it like 
really heavily.

1625
01:18:17,330 --> 01:18:18,163
But I think it,
I really think it wasn't just the gay 

1626
01:18:19,491 --> 01:18:21,470
thing was also that it was,
it was new,

1627
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:22,633
new,
there was a new thing that was killing 

1628
01:18:23,751 --> 01:18:25,610
people.
We were always worried about that.

1629
01:18:25,611 --> 01:18:26,444
Right.
There's always these pandemic movies 

1630
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:30,260
where some new crazy disease breaks 
loose,

1631
01:18:30,290 --> 01:18:32,330
just runs rampant.
We don't have an immune system for it.

1632
01:18:32,331 --> 01:18:35,090
People will start dying and they need to
get the medication to the people and get

1633
01:18:35,091 --> 01:18:36,020
it to the baby quickly.

1634
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:41,210
People are putting it on subway subways.
Just always sOme shit like tHat.

1635
01:18:41,211 --> 01:18:44,840
We always have some new shit that's 
gonna get us swine flu,

1636
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:46,960
flu.
So that was.

1637
01:18:46,961 --> 01:18:47,794
So aids had a dual,
a disadvaNtage one that is connected to 

1638
01:18:52,491 --> 01:18:54,180
gay people and people are like,
oh,

1639
01:18:54,181 --> 01:18:57,440
what do they do over there?
What are they going to get it?

1640
01:18:57,441 --> 01:18:58,430
I'm lucky.
Yeah,

1641
01:18:58,431 --> 01:18:59,264
exactly.
TheRe was that and then there was also 

1642
01:19:00,950 --> 01:19:03,070
blood transfusions,
car accident.

1643
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:03,891
That's right,
right.

1644
01:19:03,891 --> 01:19:06,200
People were worried about getting from 
blood transfusions,

1645
01:19:06,260 --> 01:19:07,093
so that means back then they were never.
They were like just letting random 

1646
01:19:09,801 --> 01:19:13,730
people donate blood without checking it.
I don't think they had a test for it for

1647
01:19:13,740 --> 01:19:14,573
awhile.
I think for awhile they didn't have a 

1648
01:19:15,531 --> 01:19:17,930
task for it.
Then they have to find like I guess they

1649
01:19:17,931 --> 01:19:20,810
have to find like antibodies in your 
blood or some shit and like.

1650
01:19:22,510 --> 01:19:24,500
But it's so weird that wall.
This is all going on.

1651
01:19:24,501 --> 01:19:27,650
How many people were dying from cancer 
every year just from smoking cigarettes.

1652
01:19:27,651 --> 01:19:30,950
It'S fucking crazy numbers.
Crazy numbers.

1653
01:19:30,951 --> 01:19:34,190
People dropping like flies and no one 
thinks about that.

1654
01:19:34,191 --> 01:19:35,024
When you see a guy smoking a cigarette,
you don't think that guys killing 

1655
01:19:36,921 --> 01:19:37,431
themselves.
They're like,

1656
01:19:37,431 --> 01:19:38,264
oh,
he's outside and for the restaurant 

1657
01:19:38,811 --> 01:19:40,610
having a cig,
normal shit.

1658
01:19:40,810 --> 01:19:43,450
Now that guy's.
That guy's poisoning themselves.

1659
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:44,473
Guy who delivers,
but it's just strange to me like we get 

1660
01:19:46,820 --> 01:19:47,653
really specific about what fears we have
in terms of what way we die and when a 

1661
01:19:52,101 --> 01:19:55,520
new disease comes along that becomes one
of the most specific ones,

1662
01:19:55,670 --> 01:20:00,050
but while you're indulging in all these 
behaviors that will also kill you in way

1663
01:20:00,051 --> 01:20:04,220
larger numbers than diseases too.
Fucking weird man.

1664
01:20:04,610 --> 01:20:06,500
Very weird.
Human Beings,

1665
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:08,130
me were so

1666
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:08,963
strange.
So strange in the way we prioritize 

1667
01:20:11,191 --> 01:20:13,440
things.
Always.

1668
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:14,710
Yeah.

1669
01:20:14,710 --> 01:20:16,350
Do you get the flu shot?
No.

1670
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:18,240
Joey diaz though.
I won't give up.

1671
01:20:18,241 --> 01:20:19,074
The joke is,
but I think had he has been born of the 

1672
01:20:21,121 --> 01:20:23,160
best new bits about it.
I never got a flu shot,

1673
01:20:23,161 --> 01:20:27,330
but I've gotten the flu once and it was 
like two years ago out of nowhere,

1674
01:20:27,331 --> 01:20:31,530
man just came up.
I hit a fat ass bowl to my legs,

1675
01:20:31,531 --> 01:20:34,560
got hot and my whole body felt hot and I
told my wife,

1676
01:20:34,561 --> 01:20:35,394
I think I'm going to get sick.
So you've hiT a bowl and that's when it 

1677
01:20:38,011 --> 01:20:40,200
came on my own.
I want to stay with a bow,

1678
01:20:40,201 --> 01:20:41,640
but that's when I started feeling hot.

1679
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:43,800
Huh.
So the,

1680
01:20:43,801 --> 01:20:45,960
we'd made you uh,
aware of it?

1681
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:48,190
Yes.
But it wasn't the weekend though.

1682
01:20:48,210 --> 01:20:49,680
Hey asshole.
Yeah.

1683
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:50,431
The.
We were struggling like,

1684
01:20:50,431 --> 01:20:52,170
hey asshole,
you got the flu.

1685
01:20:52,770 --> 01:20:57,480
You better pay attention to your body.
I got a couple of years ago,

1686
01:20:57,481 --> 01:21:00,450
I kicked it quick because of heart.
I caught it coming on.

1687
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,070
I felt it.
I was like,

1688
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:03,660
oh,
I know what this is.

1689
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:05,970
And I just laid down.
They didn't do shit.

1690
01:21:06,570 --> 01:21:10,620
I just laid down and drank a lot of tea.
Chill the fuck out.

1691
01:21:10,650 --> 01:21:11,483
I didn't do shit.
I just lay down and relax and let my 

1692
01:21:13,471 --> 01:21:16,290
body recuperate itself.
I got lucky that it was,

1693
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:18,000
it happened during a time where I 
wasn't.

1694
01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:20,760
I didn't have anything to do that day so
I can take time off.

1695
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:24,630
I heard that when you get a real hot or 
real a good flu,

1696
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:28,230
it let your body fighting off something 
inside your body.

1697
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:30,600
Yeah.
Your body's basically going to war.

1698
01:21:30,820 --> 01:21:33,120
Fuck yeah.
You sweating up a storm.

1699
01:21:33,140 --> 01:21:34,920
The body's trying to chase out the 
invaders.

1700
01:21:34,921 --> 01:21:38,320
You got people trying to get over that 
wall in my body.

1701
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:42,270
Your body has little organisms trying to
get over their walls.

1702
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:46,810
You got wall set up to keep these things
from breeding and you know,

1703
01:21:47,310 --> 01:21:50,790
taking over parts of your body.
She got this immune system just going to

1704
01:21:50,791 --> 01:21:51,624
war.
You got a little war going on in your 

1705
01:21:52,801 --> 01:21:53,634
body when you're sick.
I know that everything is fighting to 

1706
01:21:55,210 --> 01:21:58,440
got pcp.
I we'd fight and got cracked fighting.

1707
01:21:59,190 --> 01:22:00,023
Yeah.
I mean people don't like when you judge 

1708
01:22:03,450 --> 01:22:04,283
people's health and you know,
you definitely shouldn't judge someone 

1709
01:22:06,661 --> 01:22:11,661
based on whether or not they're sick or 
when what you're looking at when you see

1710
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:13,590
people that are sick,
including yourself.

1711
01:22:13,650 --> 01:22:18,650
All of us where we're looking at as an 
organism that is at war and we have this

1712
01:22:20,761 --> 01:22:23,190
weird instinct to kind of get awaY from 
them.

1713
01:22:23,191 --> 01:22:23,911
Like,
oh my god,

1714
01:22:23,911 --> 01:22:26,310
I could get that.
I could get that organism,

1715
01:22:26,311 --> 01:22:26,760
whatever that.
Well,

1716
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:28,590
I got to get away from it.
What if one of the troops,

1717
01:22:28,620 --> 01:22:31,320
troops jumps off of him and hops into 
me?

1718
01:22:31,321 --> 01:22:32,910
I can't afford to take time off work 
now.

1719
01:22:32,911 --> 01:22:33,744
Get away from me.

1720
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:36,180
I don't have.
I don't have time for.

1721
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:38,420
I don't got time for your coughing,
blood,

1722
01:22:38,450 --> 01:22:40,300
don't pump blood on a zombie man.

1723
01:22:40,940 --> 01:22:45,320
But look how many people like um,
who don't have,

1724
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:46,273
who don't ever really take care of their
body because I know like before I want 

1725
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:53,060
to coming stanley,
I never had healthcare how just gambling

1726
01:22:53,070 --> 01:22:53,903
with my body,
how do we go to other than go to the 

1727
01:22:55,281 --> 01:22:56,114
hospital and I was really dying and when
I went to the hospital I went to this 

1728
01:23:00,951 --> 01:23:04,040
cheap little hospital right here in echo
park.

1729
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:06,910
Bad was iT,
it was fucked up man.

1730
01:23:06,911 --> 01:23:08,320
it was like,
it was real.

1731
01:23:08,321 --> 01:23:10,570
It was,
it smelled like an old elementary school

1732
01:23:10,571 --> 01:23:11,404
and they're sick all down and it smelled
like pine sol because the old korean 

1733
01:23:16,001 --> 01:23:20,430
doctor there and I told her what was 
wrong with me and she,

1734
01:23:21,190 --> 01:23:25,210
I told her I have a flu.
I got my butt hurts because I might have

1735
01:23:25,211 --> 01:23:26,830
a hemorrhoid.
I don't know what's going on.

1736
01:23:27,190 --> 01:23:28,420
I'm bleeding out of my ass.

1737
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:29,950
Damn.
And she goes,

1738
01:23:29,951 --> 01:23:30,820
okay,
sit down.

1739
01:23:31,030 --> 01:23:34,390
And now she's all,
she and I paid $100 and which would give

1740
01:23:34,391 --> 01:23:36,140
you,
she gave me medicines for,

1741
01:23:36,170 --> 01:23:37,003
for The fourth of hemorrhoid because I 
had been running for the first time and 

1742
01:23:40,091 --> 01:23:44,470
then she gave me antibiotics for my flu.
What is hemorrhoids come from?

1743
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:46,620
Does it come from.
You're trying to force your pool out,

1744
01:23:46,690 --> 01:23:47,523
man.
That's what someone told me my first 

1745
01:23:49,811 --> 01:23:51,560
time.
I didn'T know man.

1746
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:52,713
I was out.
I was on the road and opened the low 

1747
01:23:55,391 --> 01:23:57,170
carb diet,
the atkins diet.

1748
01:23:57,740 --> 01:24:01,870
So I was fucking with.
I eat cheese and meat all week.

1749
01:24:02,020 --> 01:24:04,390
you're bound up and I didn't eat,
drink no water.

1750
01:24:04,391 --> 01:24:09,391
I drink soda so I must've been stuffed.
So joe,

1751
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:11,500
I'm in my,
I'm in the bathroom,

1752
01:24:11,501 --> 01:24:15,570
like the show's over and like two days,
nothing right now.

1753
01:24:15,850 --> 01:24:17,500
And they could feel like,
um,

1754
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:20,490
like my,
my butthole already felt like,

1755
01:24:20,660 --> 01:24:22,720
um,
have broken glass inside.

1756
01:24:22,780 --> 01:24:23,860
Oh,
that feeling.

1757
01:24:24,130 --> 01:24:28,390
So I finally,
I pushed too hard because I,

1758
01:24:28,391 --> 01:24:30,850
I pushed her like I was having a baby.
I waS like,

1759
01:24:31,030 --> 01:24:34,550
I was doing mas and then up on the 
youtube screen please.

1760
01:24:36,740 --> 01:24:37,573
So I fuck it up while he's talking and 
then I pushed and I pushed and then 

1761
01:24:44,281 --> 01:24:45,280
like,
aw man,

1762
01:24:45,281 --> 01:24:46,114
I could just feel I saw like I wiped 
myself and it might the toilet paper 

1763
01:24:50,180 --> 01:24:53,590
like a fucking tampon.
And I was in pain.

1764
01:24:53,591 --> 01:24:54,170
Dude.

1765
01:24:54,170 --> 01:24:55,003
It says the veins around your anus tend 
to stretch under pressure and may bulge 

1766
01:24:57,981 --> 01:24:58,814
or swell swollen veins.
Hemorrhoids can develop from increased 

1767
01:25:02,631 --> 01:25:07,631
pressure in the lower rectum due to 
straining during bowel movements,

1768
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:12,110
sitting for long periods of time on the 
toilet.

1769
01:25:12,380 --> 01:25:14,090
Eddie bravo has a hilarious bit about it

1770
01:25:14,810 --> 01:25:17,470
being on his phone,
on his phone and taking a shit.

1771
01:25:17,530 --> 01:25:19,660
It's very funny.
Remember,

1772
01:25:19,661 --> 01:25:21,820
didn't he talk about it on here?
I think you've talked about it on here,

1773
01:25:22,420 --> 01:25:23,740
but it was crazy.
Yeah.

1774
01:25:23,950 --> 01:25:25,660
NOt good for your butthole to be sitting
in that.

1775
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:28,270
How would describe the position of the 
pain?

1776
01:25:28,271 --> 01:25:29,290
It feels like?
Um,

1777
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:30,433
I remember talking about in a bit,
I said that it felt like every night 

1778
01:25:33,820 --> 01:25:36,240
though,
the goals sort of siloed by using me.

1779
01:25:37,020 --> 01:25:38,800
Like,
fuck you in the ass at night.

1780
01:25:38,860 --> 01:25:41,750
How many days did you go before he took 
a shut off?

1781
01:25:41,950 --> 01:25:43,820
Three days,
that's what the share,

1782
01:25:43,821 --> 01:25:44,654
that's one of the pain started and I 
blew my butthole out I guess and then 

1783
01:25:48,251 --> 01:25:49,084
like three days later I didn't shit 
right without paying for like two weeks 

1784
01:25:53,610 --> 01:25:55,510
I was afraid of fucking neat man

1785
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:57,233
about to go to a doctor and they had to 
literally break up the shit in his butt 

1786
01:26:00,311 --> 01:26:01,144
hole.
They had to go up as bought with an 

1787
01:26:02,611 --> 01:26:04,040
instrument and break it up

1788
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:06,410
and flush him out.
Give him something.

1789
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:07,273
I think he had to take something,
some sort of diuretic and some stool 

1790
01:26:10,131 --> 01:26:10,964
loosening agent like some hardcore drugs
and then they had to go in there with 

1791
01:26:14,341 --> 01:26:15,174
like a chisel and chop off this concrete
log that he at the bottom of his button 

1792
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:21,490
and then he,
you know,

1793
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:24,500
he hadn't shit in many days.
Try to.

1794
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:25,513
Yeah,
it was dangerous and he couldn't get it 

1795
01:26:26,601 --> 01:26:29,390
out so he was literally plugged up and 
it kept piling in.

1796
01:26:29,660 --> 01:26:32,500
It's not like it's going to stop eating,
it's just going to keep piling in.

1797
01:26:32,510 --> 01:26:37,510
So he's got a blockade of like shit 
rocks at the end of his booty tunnel and

1798
01:26:37,750 --> 01:26:40,700
it's real property can be bad.
So real problem.

1799
01:26:40,730 --> 01:26:41,563
He had to go to a doctor.
My life finally came out and then a 

1800
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:46,670
clink clink,
but It was all bad with all dry,

1801
01:26:46,671 --> 01:26:48,540
with ugly,
painful.

1802
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:51,700
You gotta eat your vegetables,
speed my speed.

1803
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:54,860
And after I finished paying,
it was hurting my butthole after I peed.

1804
01:26:55,670 --> 01:26:56,503
I mean that's one thing that I freak out
about people that are on this carnivore 

1805
01:27:00,111 --> 01:27:00,944
diet.
I hear this carnivore diet stuff and 

1806
01:27:02,301 --> 01:27:03,081
they're like,
oh no,

1807
01:27:03,081 --> 01:27:05,330
no problem at all.
No problem at all.

1808
01:27:05,780 --> 01:27:07,880
You don't eat any vegetables.
You got no problem at all.

1809
01:27:08,590 --> 01:27:09,423
Wouldn't really kill you.
Eat some broccoli with that little kale 

1810
01:27:11,950 --> 01:27:14,600
is elusive in that motherfucking line 
up.

1811
01:27:14,900 --> 01:27:17,090
I just can't imagine the broccoli's 
killing you.

1812
01:27:17,570 --> 01:27:20,320
I think if broccoli's killing you,
come on,

1813
01:27:21,050 --> 01:27:21,883
there's probably something else wrong 
you should probably like get your blood 

1814
01:27:24,261 --> 01:27:26,300
work done for.
I fiGured out what the vitamins are.

1815
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:28,460
If you eat broccoli and you start 
getting headaches,

1816
01:27:28,461 --> 01:27:29,450
bra,
eat broccoli.

1817
01:27:29,710 --> 01:27:30,830
Folks,
what about gains?

1818
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:32,450
Are you broccoli?
I get a headache,

1819
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:33,953
man.
People have been eating broccoli 

1820
01:27:34,461 --> 01:27:35,294
forever.

1821
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:36,800
Like,
how's that possible?

1822
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:37,853
Like what?
When did broccoli ever become something 

1823
01:27:39,631 --> 01:27:43,310
that you feel shitty after you ate?
Has anybody ever said that?

1824
01:27:43,790 --> 01:27:44,660
Like,
I eat broccoli,

1825
01:27:44,661 --> 01:27:47,950
I just fuck get hooks folks with my 
immune system.

1826
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:50,210
Dudes will claim that.
Now these carnivore guys,

1827
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:51,340
a lot of them are claiming,
look,

1828
01:27:51,341 --> 01:27:52,930
I,
I eat a fucking salad,

1829
01:27:52,940 --> 01:27:55,070
bro.
I'm off for awhile.

1830
01:27:55,340 --> 01:27:57,530
People.
I typed it in back at the other way.

1831
01:27:57,560 --> 01:27:59,360
In general,
broccoli is safe to eat.

1832
01:27:59,361 --> 01:28:00,194
Any side effects or not serious?
Most common side effect is gas or bowel 

1833
01:28:04,011 --> 01:28:05,300
irritation.
Yeah.

1834
01:28:05,301 --> 01:28:09,080
Broccoli farts caused by broccoli's.
High amounts of fiber.

1835
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:11,330
All cruciferous.
That's a great word.

1836
01:28:11,331 --> 01:28:13,910
Cruciferous vegetables can make you 
grassy.

1837
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:14,833
Oh,
gassy,

1838
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:18,260
but who's super gassy,
gassy,

1839
01:28:18,290 --> 01:28:19,820
or are you a scIentist or not?
You?

1840
01:28:19,821 --> 01:28:21,050
Fuck,
okay.

1841
01:28:21,110 --> 01:28:23,390
When you're a scientist,
you scientific terms,

1842
01:28:23,391 --> 01:28:26,840
you don't say gassy with me,
but he's scared saying farts.

1843
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:28,513
Gassy.
But the health benefits outweigh the 

1844
01:28:29,901 --> 01:28:30,950
discomfort.
yeah.

1845
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:32,960
So there's certain people like,
um,

1846
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:34,153
that I think have a real physical issue.
Like Jordan Peterson is wonderful when 

1847
01:28:36,861 --> 01:28:37,694
it describes like he,
he literally can't have anything other 

1848
01:28:40,401 --> 01:28:41,234
than me and at this point in his life or
it gives them headaches and it fucks 

1849
01:28:44,811 --> 01:28:45,644
with them.
I think certain people may all bullshit 

1850
01:28:48,651 --> 01:28:49,484
aside,
might have a real biological issue with 

1851
01:28:51,651 --> 01:28:53,420
vegetabLes,
which sounds insane,

1852
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:57,810
but it only makes sense.
People have a problem with everything is

1853
01:28:57,850 --> 01:29:00,350
there's certain people that have a 
problem with almost everything.

1854
01:29:00,351 --> 01:29:01,184
There's people that are to citrus as 
people that are allergic to certain 

1855
01:29:03,910 --> 01:29:06,180
cahtos yeah.
All kinds of plants.

1856
01:29:06,181 --> 01:29:07,680
There's people that are allergic to 
grass.

1857
01:29:07,740 --> 01:29:11,400
Why wouldn't be allergic to some 
vegetables?

1858
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:12,593
So if you are allergic to some 
vegetables and you just go on an all 

1859
01:29:16,111 --> 01:29:19,260
meat diet,
all those symptoms of those allergies go

1860
01:29:19,261 --> 01:29:19,860
away.

1861
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:20,693
Why wouldn't that make sense to people?
I mean there's so many people fighting 

1862
01:29:24,121 --> 01:29:24,954
off the idea,
this carnivore diet that you're only 

1863
01:29:27,811 --> 01:29:28,644
eating meat and you feel fantastic.
You're probably dealing with a bunch of 

1864
01:29:31,681 --> 01:29:35,640
people that have undiagnosed 
interactions,

1865
01:29:36,030 --> 01:29:36,863
negative interactions with vegetables.
This is probably something about their 

1866
01:29:40,711 --> 01:29:43,020
system that does not go well with 
vegetables,

1867
01:29:43,021 --> 01:29:43,854
so they should take vitamins.
I take vitamins and eat meat and you 

1868
01:29:46,231 --> 01:29:48,900
better find a way to get fiber.
Kids.

1869
01:29:49,410 --> 01:29:52,650
I didn't want to get all backed up.
Vegetables are good.

1870
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:55,770
I think if you eat like a really fatty 
meat though,

1871
01:29:55,980 --> 01:29:58,740
you don't have that problem.
If you eat like a ton of rib eyes,

1872
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:00,960
it just greases up that whole pipeline 
and you're like,

1873
01:30:01,010 --> 01:30:03,540
ooh,
everything comes flying out.

1874
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:07,380
I think when you start eating that lean 
ground bison meat,

1875
01:30:07,580 --> 01:30:08,413
you know no butter.
Like you're gonna have a problem for 

1876
01:30:10,670 --> 01:30:11,503
butterball.

1877
01:30:11,610 --> 01:30:12,443
Yeah.
You chew that shit down and pack it 

1878
01:30:13,381 --> 01:30:15,300
down.
Then you water on top of it.

1879
01:30:15,301 --> 01:30:18,720
So it's like you go like the pack that 
bison here and then you've got the water

1880
01:30:18,721 --> 01:30:20,880
behind that.
It's concrete a fine.

1881
01:30:20,890 --> 01:30:24,270
Find its way through your body.
Have some broccoli,

1882
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:25,570
bro.
Kill.

1883
01:30:25,710 --> 01:30:26,543
Put some cheese on it.
Some people really firmly believe that 

1884
01:30:29,191 --> 01:30:31,830
dairy is bad for you.
And that's something I've never tried.

1885
01:30:32,070 --> 01:30:32,990
I've never tried.
You know,

1886
01:30:33,020 --> 01:30:33,770
had dairy?
No,

1887
01:30:33,770 --> 01:30:34,021
no,
no.

1888
01:30:34,021 --> 01:30:34,854
To not have dairy.
I've never tried to like way off 100 

1889
01:30:37,591 --> 01:30:39,090
percent dairy.
I don't eat much,

1890
01:30:39,091 --> 01:30:39,924
but if I do it's mostly cheese.
Hardly ever drink milk unless it's with 

1891
01:30:43,051 --> 01:30:45,330
cookies and whenever I do,
I always feel weird.

1892
01:30:45,380 --> 01:30:46,570
No.
If I need milk I shouldn't.

1893
01:30:46,580 --> 01:30:47,413
Myself.

1894
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:53,790
I've been my whole life to them tolerate
and I didn't even know that.

1895
01:30:54,450 --> 01:30:55,283
My mom never told me,
but every time I'm eating cheese I have 

1896
01:30:57,901 --> 01:31:00,690
problem against the stuff.
It'll come out to him.

1897
01:31:00,780 --> 01:31:03,060
So I fought with almond milk and soy 
milk now.

1898
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:05,040
Yeah.
Do you fuck with vegan cheese?

1899
01:31:05,850 --> 01:31:07,380
Everything big.
only meeting no more.

1900
01:31:07,590 --> 01:31:09,120
When did you stop?
Why wouldn't have.

1901
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:10,890
Fuck my asshole blew up.
That's good.

1902
01:31:10,891 --> 01:31:12,840
Move.
Fucked up the fiber.

1903
01:31:12,841 --> 01:31:17,220
And you feel good though.
You feel fat?

1904
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:19,340
People don't believe me.
The theory.

1905
01:31:19,350 --> 01:31:20,400
Vegan.
You're a fucking fat.

1906
01:31:20,430 --> 01:31:24,000
What crops do?
Why are you opposed to eggs?

1907
01:31:24,660 --> 01:31:25,340
Oh no,
just the.

1908
01:31:25,340 --> 01:31:30,300
Just give it all up man.
I got so scared after I started bleeding

1909
01:31:30,301 --> 01:31:31,410
man.
And I said,

1910
01:31:31,411 --> 01:31:33,930
you know what?
God died on point.

1911
01:31:34,590 --> 01:31:36,060
You feel better.
I feel good.

1912
01:31:36,410 --> 01:31:38,700
I mean I don't have.
I don't have the runs.

1913
01:31:39,020 --> 01:31:39,853
Know that shit on myself anymore.
You ever try out this other types of 

1914
01:31:43,801 --> 01:31:45,550
diets or is this the first one?
No,

1915
01:31:45,551 --> 01:31:48,420
I tried being a vegan,
I tried the atkins diet,

1916
01:31:48,421 --> 01:31:52,130
I tried the hollywood diet,
you know,

1917
01:31:52,170 --> 01:31:56,500
when you wake up in the morning and do 
some coke and it sucked.

1918
01:31:56,920 --> 01:31:59,350
I never tried that one.

1919
01:32:00,970 --> 01:32:01,803
Yeah.
Um,

1920
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:03,393
do,
are you trying to lose weight or you're 

1921
01:32:04,271 --> 01:32:05,110
good?
No,

1922
01:32:05,111 --> 01:32:05,944
I mean I,
I couldn't lose weight but I was bigger 

1923
01:32:07,451 --> 01:32:11,730
than I am right now because of a.
No,

1924
01:32:11,750 --> 01:32:16,750
there's not really a diet.
I just started this in 2011 or 2012.

1925
01:32:18,521 --> 01:32:19,354
And you said when your ass was bleeding,
that's when you decided that's where 

1926
01:32:21,380 --> 01:32:22,630
they started.
Started off slow.

1927
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:24,033
I just stopped drinking milk first and 
then I thought was cheesed then meet 

1928
01:32:29,410 --> 01:32:32,770
with the hardest fish.
Chicken little slow.

1929
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:36,580
And what do you replace it with?
Like what kind of foods?

1930
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:39,670
My wife,
she was raised vegan in dayton,

1931
01:32:39,671 --> 01:32:44,671
Ohio by her mom dam and you know the and
they were poor so they grew up in a,

1932
01:32:45,740 --> 01:32:46,573
in a trailer park.
So that must have been tough for them 

1933
01:32:48,641 --> 01:32:51,270
being vegan.
So I just started little by little,

1934
01:32:51,790 --> 01:32:52,623
it helped me because she will not be 
good at the time when I started being 

1935
01:32:56,171 --> 01:32:57,004
vegan.

1936
01:32:57,490 --> 01:32:59,090
I got it.
I still love me,

1937
01:32:59,091 --> 01:33:00,730
man.
Like fuck.

1938
01:33:00,731 --> 01:33:02,950
Yeah man.
Like hamburgers,

1939
01:33:03,010 --> 01:33:04,540
ribs,
ribeye,

1940
01:33:05,230 --> 01:33:07,960
lobster,
jack in the box.

1941
01:33:08,440 --> 01:33:09,273
Number five.
Do you go and get your blood tested and 

1942
01:33:11,441 --> 01:33:12,274
get yourself checked out?
I got my blood tested two years ago and 

1943
01:33:15,221 --> 01:33:17,800
I'm supposed to get my blood tested this
week again,

1944
01:33:18,010 --> 01:33:18,843
him two years ago.
And how do you look like in terms of 

1945
01:33:22,301 --> 01:33:24,400
your vitamins,
getting enough nutrients?

1946
01:33:24,401 --> 01:33:28,000
Do they do all that kind of stuff?
Tests your vitamin d levels.

1947
01:33:28,380 --> 01:33:29,213
That totally took my b levels.
It was for sugar and everything was 

1948
01:33:32,741 --> 01:33:33,580
cool.
Yeah,

1949
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:35,793
that's good.
He just told me that I could lose 30 

1950
01:33:37,451 --> 01:33:38,450
pounds.
Yeah.

1951
01:33:39,700 --> 01:33:44,500
Well the first women I've watched your 
videos every once in a while I'll try to

1952
01:33:44,501 --> 01:33:47,320
get into the ice thing.
You got into the ice things rough.

1953
01:33:47,410 --> 01:33:52,410
I want to know what's good to saunas.
Saunas are usually nine degrees.

1954
01:33:56,380 --> 01:33:59,150
Is that like a different side of the 
head with the why?

1955
01:33:59,151 --> 01:34:00,630
Mca right now?
Saunas.

1956
01:34:00,670 --> 01:34:03,880
The same steam rooms,
dIfferent steam room is like if,

1957
01:34:04,060 --> 01:34:07,600
if steam gets out or.
Well it's a,

1958
01:34:07,601 --> 01:34:10,960
it really is like in the implementation 
of it more than anything,

1959
01:34:10,990 --> 01:34:13,690
but if he did,
I'm a steam room,

1960
01:34:13,691 --> 01:34:17,380
most likely was a tile floor and you go 
in there with a towel,

1961
01:34:17,390 --> 01:34:18,223
Florida oil last door and it just hot 
steam and everybody just gets hot in 

1962
01:34:22,941 --> 01:34:24,850
there and then they get to sweating and 
they leave,

1963
01:34:25,090 --> 01:34:25,923
but the song is different in that it's a
dry heat so you go in there and it's 

1964
01:34:29,380 --> 01:34:31,930
usually.
I think the idea is,

1965
01:34:31,931 --> 01:34:32,764
and I could be wrong here,
but I think the idea is that the steam 

1966
01:34:34,811 --> 01:34:36,970
room can't get as hot as a song because 
if it did,

1967
01:34:36,971 --> 01:34:38,890
it would kind of cook you because it's 
wet.

1968
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:39,993
It would be like hot wet air around you.
It kind of cook you as opposed to the 

1969
01:34:43,091 --> 01:34:45,670
hot dry air.
That doesn't make any sense.

1970
01:34:46,040 --> 01:34:50,080
It's touching little hot.
The hot rocks at the sauna.

1971
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:51,160
The sauna.
Yeah.

1972
01:34:51,160 --> 01:34:54,070
It's because it's conducted waters,
waters conducting the heat.

1973
01:34:54,100 --> 01:34:55,150
That's what it is.
Right?

1974
01:34:55,210 --> 01:34:56,980
So the air doesn't conduct the heat as 
well.

1975
01:34:57,050 --> 01:34:58,260
The water does.
Okay,

1976
01:34:58,460 --> 01:35:00,740
so that's makes sense because of the 
sauna.

1977
01:35:00,741 --> 01:35:04,130
You can get to a fucking,
a crispy degree,

1978
01:35:04,170 --> 01:35:06,560
crispy temperature before you body 
starts to freak out.

1979
01:35:07,970 --> 01:35:10,550
That's like the old school.
Highlight the rat pack,

1980
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:11,593
so not trying to sit around the song and
party all night and then take a little 

1981
01:35:15,051 --> 01:35:17,290
steam in the morning,
get all the alcohol.

1982
01:35:17,630 --> 01:35:18,463
It doesn't really do that,
but it doesn't make you feel a little 

1983
01:35:20,451 --> 01:35:21,231
better.
Yeah.

1984
01:35:21,231 --> 01:35:25,490
If you fucked up from drinking,
you could also run the risk of could you

1985
01:35:25,491 --> 01:35:27,970
might be dehydrated.
You could run the risk of blacking out.

1986
01:35:28,380 --> 01:35:29,450
You know,
if you're.

1987
01:35:29,780 --> 01:35:32,790
If you're susceptible to that and you 
look at them all there,

1988
01:35:33,240 --> 01:35:36,040
he's on the phone,
matches on the phone,

1989
01:35:36,570 --> 01:35:40,220
is there in the sauna,
landau,

1990
01:35:40,221 --> 01:35:42,440
look at these guys.
That's hilarious.

1991
01:35:42,650 --> 01:35:44,210
Meanwhile,
how'd the photographer get in there,

1992
01:35:44,211 --> 01:35:48,230
but I call bullshit.
I call bullshit the phone.

1993
01:35:48,230 --> 01:35:49,063
I call bullshit with the photographer 
during the ocean's 11 where we know 

1994
01:35:52,780 --> 01:35:54,930
probably really happened.
I'm sure he did iT all the time and they

1995
01:35:54,931 --> 01:35:55,310
said,
yeah,

1996
01:35:55,310 --> 01:35:58,350
come on in and take a picture of us.
This is what we do.

1997
01:36:00,290 --> 01:36:01,650
Guys were having a good time,
highly.

1998
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:03,950
I remember the time they were having a 
good time man.

1999
01:36:04,160 --> 01:36:04,890
Too.
Crazy.

2000
01:36:04,890 --> 01:36:06,200
Like in their fifties there,
right?

2001
01:36:06,201 --> 01:36:07,034
Oh yeah.
They were older guys and they got 

2002
01:36:08,541 --> 01:36:09,374
together and they just did whatever the 
fuck they wanted and they'd go to vegas 

2003
01:36:11,811 --> 01:36:12,644
and party and everybody wanted to go 
party with them there at the sands 

2004
01:36:15,691 --> 01:36:16,820
there,
the sand.

2005
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:18,530
The says.
It's crazy.

2006
01:36:18,531 --> 01:36:21,380
When you look at those old hotels and 
casinos in vegas,

2007
01:36:21,381 --> 01:36:22,214
they just decided to dynamite item,
but what would you give to to stay in 

2008
01:36:25,911 --> 01:36:26,744
the sands today if they kept everything 
up to date but current with the era in 

2009
01:36:32,931 --> 01:36:33,860
which it was created.

2010
01:36:34,090 --> 01:36:34,923
like if you went there,
it was a total retro hotel room with 

2011
01:36:36,981 --> 01:36:40,410
like fucking dial up phones and you 
know,

2012
01:36:40,530 --> 01:36:44,760
just.
I mean there's god,

2013
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:46,530
there's something to be said for it,
right?

2014
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:48,650
Like if you,
if you live in a log cabin,

2015
01:36:48,890 --> 01:36:51,620
like there's something really cool about
a log cabin,

2016
01:36:51,980 --> 01:36:53,310
right?
Like you're,

2017
01:36:53,350 --> 01:36:56,650
you're living in a way that people lived
like this a thousand years ago.

2018
01:36:56,670 --> 01:36:58,130
Man,
this is real.

2019
01:36:58,131 --> 01:36:58,964
This is really how people live.
But no one wants to live like people 

2020
01:37:01,041 --> 01:37:03,270
lived in the sixties,
you know,

2021
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:08,280
like if they had a place like that where
you had all the same kind of furniture,

2022
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:12,710
just updated all the same law.
Tensiles yeah.

2023
01:37:13,010 --> 01:37:15,770
But have that shit like they had it back
then.

2024
01:37:15,980 --> 01:37:18,690
How many people would want that?
Man,

2025
01:37:18,710 --> 01:37:19,543
let me,
like vegas was only made possible 

2026
01:37:21,711 --> 01:37:24,030
because of air conditioning.
Oh yeah.

2027
01:37:24,290 --> 01:37:25,123
Water.
They couldn't have pulled that off if 

2028
01:37:26,931 --> 01:37:29,240
they didn't have some sort of way to 
cool the place down.

2029
01:37:32,340 --> 01:37:34,890
When did that start?
Because that's a good question.

2030
01:37:35,620 --> 01:37:37,350
I've got a bit hottest shit.
I don't.

2031
01:37:37,351 --> 01:37:38,184
Well,
the ice house where we do stand up was 

2032
01:37:42,170 --> 01:37:47,170
his 58 years old.
Before that it was some sort of a,

2033
01:37:47,970 --> 01:37:50,010
I think it was some sort of,

2034
01:37:51,750 --> 01:37:52,583
uh,
an actual ice house where they bring it 

2035
01:37:54,710 --> 01:37:55,501
at,
at some point.

2036
01:37:55,501 --> 01:37:56,850
It's history.
That's what it used to be.

2037
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:57,833
It used to be a storage place where 
people that didn't have frigerators 

2038
01:37:59,850 --> 01:38:02,040
yeah,
that's what the whole place it would buy

2039
01:38:02,041 --> 01:38:05,940
a block of ice and they would take this 
ice and they carry it home.

2040
01:38:05,970 --> 01:38:08,400
Jesus christ.
That wasn't that long ago,

2041
01:38:08,401 --> 01:38:10,680
man.
I mean that's less than 100 years ago.

2042
01:38:11,250 --> 01:38:14,550
That's insane.
So late 1947.

2043
01:38:14,551 --> 01:38:16,680
Bugsy siegel flamingo.
Yeah,

2044
01:38:16,681 --> 01:38:18,900
I bet it.
I bet it couldn't be.

2045
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:20,660
I'm going to take a guess.
I feel like we've probably,

2046
01:38:20,661 --> 01:38:21,494
we've talked about this already.
I've just forgotten because I'm too 

2047
01:38:23,161 --> 01:38:25,220
stupid to maintain all this information 
anymore.

2048
01:38:25,270 --> 01:38:28,340
My brain's overfilled.
Um,

2049
01:38:28,860 --> 01:38:31,620
I want to say it happened somewhere 
around the 19 twenties.

2050
01:38:32,610 --> 01:38:34,650
The 19 fifties.
What?

2051
01:38:35,250 --> 01:38:37,090
There was no refrigerators for the 
fifties.

2052
01:38:37,110 --> 01:38:37,910
Refrigerators.
I'm sorry.

2053
01:38:37,910 --> 01:38:39,690
Is air conditioning in vegas as I was 
looking at.

2054
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:40,441
Oh,
sorry,

2055
01:38:40,441 --> 01:38:43,350
I missed.
I'm sorry I was rambling.

2056
01:38:43,410 --> 01:38:45,840
I was going with bulk of siena was going
with a mango,

2057
01:38:45,870 --> 01:38:48,300
so air conditioning and refrigeration.
We're definitely,

2058
01:38:48,440 --> 01:38:49,273
we went with the ice house,
which is a blocks of ice that they used 

2059
01:38:51,421 --> 01:38:52,254
to use for ice boxes.
When do you think they invented the 

2060
01:38:55,321 --> 01:38:57,780
refrigerator where they didn't have to 
do that for the refrigerator.

2061
01:38:57,781 --> 01:39:01,890
The ice chest.
So I'll check,

2062
01:39:01,891 --> 01:39:04,500
but I think they pr man.
So with air conditioning,

2063
01:39:04,501 --> 01:39:05,670
the fifties.
So the,

2064
01:39:05,710 --> 01:39:06,543
the,
the big roaring times of the vegas 

2065
01:39:09,630 --> 01:39:13,440
eruption was probably right after that 
and he had to be like right after it was

2066
01:39:13,441 --> 01:39:14,274
invented.
Well there was different type of 

2067
01:39:15,510 --> 01:39:18,450
condition that though the standard air 
condition that we have now,

2068
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:22,400
but I used to work at.
I used to work at sears roebuck's and in

2069
01:39:22,410 --> 01:39:26,560
boyle heights.
It's an old sears building and they 87,

2070
01:39:26,570 --> 01:39:27,403
it was a big earthquake and I was 
working there and that's in all the 

2071
01:39:30,121 --> 01:39:30,954
water came down.
They have a swamp cooler so it's like a 

2072
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:35,153
big show with a bunch of water in it.
And that's a really an old aIr 

2073
01:39:38,041 --> 01:39:42,500
conditioner by the mid to late 1930 
swamp coolers.

2074
01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:46,530
Homes by maybe 15 degrees,
but added humidity.

2075
01:39:48,760 --> 01:39:51,240
It was bad dude.
swamp coolers.

2076
01:39:51,510 --> 01:39:55,810
I liked the name and swamp coolers.
It was luck.

2077
01:39:56,850 --> 01:39:58,410
I had to clean one of them 
motherfuckers.

2078
01:39:58,411 --> 01:39:59,540
Man.
It was huge.

2079
01:39:59,541 --> 01:40:03,300
It was bigger than that for the whole 
building that it's crazy.

2080
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:06,630
And it broke another one who came down.
Yeah,

2081
01:40:06,631 --> 01:40:08,130
man.
Air conditioning.

2082
01:40:08,310 --> 01:40:11,160
If you live in the northeast in the 
summertime,

2083
01:40:11,161 --> 01:40:13,820
it gets wet.
Like I lived in boston,

2084
01:40:13,821 --> 01:40:17,730
there was a wet place like when,
when the summertime would come around,

2085
01:40:17,731 --> 01:40:20,040
you wouldn't,
it wouldn't just be that it was hot out.

2086
01:40:20,041 --> 01:40:21,890
It was hot and wet,
you know,

2087
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:24,990
things get sweaty as fuck.
Mosquitoes are everywhere.

2088
01:40:24,991 --> 01:40:25,920
Yeah,
real muggy.

2089
01:40:26,220 --> 01:40:28,830
It's a weird feeling,
but it's cool because you're,

2090
01:40:28,831 --> 01:40:31,020
you realize it's not going to happen 
very long,

2091
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:32,180
you know,
so like when,

2092
01:40:32,181 --> 01:40:36,150
when it is muggy,
the thing about like real contrast,

2093
01:40:36,151 --> 01:40:38,460
whether that's one thing we just don't 
get in California,

2094
01:40:38,461 --> 01:40:39,630
we don't get a contrast.

2095
01:40:40,020 --> 01:40:40,853
If you live in a place like New York,
you'll have a summer that is brutally 

2096
01:40:44,101 --> 01:40:47,520
hot and muggy and people are walking 
around and sweating and they're like,

2097
01:40:47,521 --> 01:40:49,250
holy shit,
it's fucking hot out.

2098
01:40:49,270 --> 01:40:50,103
Fuck fucking hot bag.
But you'll also have a winter where 

2099
01:40:52,141 --> 01:40:54,640
you've got your shit pulled up to your 
face.

2100
01:40:54,650 --> 01:40:55,483
You're fucking die and man,
you can't wait to get on that train or 

2101
01:40:58,320 --> 01:40:59,153
the bus or hop in an uber.
You just got to get out of this fucking 

2102
01:41:01,871 --> 01:41:03,150
cold.
Oh,

2103
01:41:03,290 --> 01:41:04,123
oh,
you're in the cab and like take you to 

2104
01:41:06,221 --> 01:41:09,640
this place.
Cab takes you to that place you all pile

2105
01:41:09,641 --> 01:41:11,560
out immediately run inside,
man.

2106
01:41:11,561 --> 01:41:14,800
There's something about that that sucks 
at the time,

2107
01:41:14,980 --> 01:41:17,560
but it's good for people who don't get 
the hill here,

2108
01:41:17,561 --> 01:41:20,230
man.
Right here in turns 70 leg warmers.

2109
01:41:23,010 --> 01:41:25,970
Oh yeah.
People are hugging it up everywhere.

2110
01:41:26,180 --> 01:41:27,013
They dug it up.
I'm sort of bringing those boots too 

2111
01:41:28,701 --> 01:41:30,980
soon.
They bring in the uggs when they weren't

2112
01:41:30,981 --> 01:41:32,990
short.
Girls are allowed to do that.

2113
01:41:33,650 --> 01:41:35,930
We don't say shit.
They can do whatever they want.

2114
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:38,690
Basically.
They were running fashion for sure.

2115
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:40,730
They decide.
Right.

2116
01:41:40,731 --> 01:41:41,564
That's why fanny packs went away.
it was because of girls don't like guys 

2117
01:41:45,170 --> 01:41:47,030
on all right.
That's what happened.

2118
01:41:47,130 --> 01:41:48,650
If I didn't pay,
the tournament will come back.

2119
01:41:48,651 --> 01:41:49,484
I remember that with a fanny pack.
The only fanny pack away to get started 

2120
01:41:54,010 --> 01:41:54,843
on goes enamel.
It was a fanny pack and then the inside 

2121
01:41:57,861 --> 01:42:00,910
had a holster for a little 38.
Mm.

2122
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:03,420
Yeah.
He tried to rob me son.

2123
01:42:04,530 --> 01:42:05,363
This video that bert kreischer just put 
up on instagram of a dude pulling us 

2124
01:42:08,930 --> 01:42:10,550
pistol out,
shoot himself in the leg,

2125
01:42:10,640 --> 01:42:12,050
try to be quick,
draw mcgraw

2126
01:42:13,490 --> 01:42:14,330
for the leg.
He goes,

2127
01:42:14,390 --> 01:42:15,223
I just fucking shot mYself and bert 
kreischer with all the tears coming out 

2128
01:42:19,851 --> 01:42:21,780
of his eyes.
Ha ha.

2129
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:24,390
He's so funny,
man.

2130
01:42:25,110 --> 01:42:27,870
Bert kreischer has a new netflix special
coming out.

2131
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:32,700
August 24th netflix.
Bert kreischer,

2132
01:42:33,060 --> 01:42:35,180
I forget what it's called,

2133
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:38,130
but bird's to be here the night before.
We're going to hype it up.

2134
01:42:38,430 --> 01:42:43,430
Secret top secret time will shave sns 
chest for secret time.

2135
01:42:45,210 --> 01:42:46,110
He's a cool dude.
That guy.

2136
01:42:46,170 --> 01:42:47,850
He's a very good dude.
I've been on this podcast.

2137
01:42:48,570 --> 01:42:50,220
He's a very good dude.
Very good guy.

2138
01:42:50,370 --> 01:42:52,730
We got a lot of good guys,
but yeah,

2139
01:42:53,450 --> 01:42:55,320
like comedy.
Today's a good time.

2140
01:42:55,350 --> 01:42:56,820
It is,
man.

2141
01:42:56,821 --> 01:42:58,230
It is.
It's a great time.

2142
01:42:58,290 --> 01:42:59,130
Funny peopLe

2143
01:42:59,450 --> 01:43:01,250
and cool people and it's fun.
Yeah,

2144
01:43:01,251 --> 01:43:02,084
it's fun.
Fun and happy again that the whole time 

2145
01:43:04,010 --> 01:43:06,050
when I got that gig.
Yeah,

2146
01:43:06,051 --> 01:43:07,340
those were fun times,
man.

2147
01:43:07,670 --> 01:43:09,050
Tyler doubloons.
Yup.

2148
01:43:09,310 --> 01:43:12,190
Go across the street.
See chewy play.

2149
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:13,553
Yeah.

2150
01:43:14,610 --> 01:43:16,730
When everything's good like that,
like it makes.

2151
01:43:16,740 --> 01:43:17,573
It's good for everybody.
It's like it makes the whole community 

2152
01:43:19,891 --> 01:43:20,724
is like more a more positive and it 
seems like we're helping out more young 

2153
01:43:24,571 --> 01:43:25,404
people coming up and then they develop a
nice positive community too and they 

2154
01:43:28,891 --> 01:43:29,724
realize,
hey man,

2155
01:43:30,060 --> 01:43:30,893
we're all trying to get somewhere,
but we're not against each other where 

2156
01:43:34,440 --> 01:43:36,810
we should be supporting each other and 
it'll help everybody.

2157
01:43:37,020 --> 01:43:38,760
It'll help you.
It'll help me.

2158
01:43:38,820 --> 01:43:41,520
There'll be more positive vibes flowing 
around everybody.

2159
01:43:41,521 --> 01:43:42,354
Be happy like we inspire each other.
We were not competing against each 

2160
01:43:45,211 --> 01:43:46,650
other.
Someone does well.

2161
01:43:46,770 --> 01:43:49,350
Don't say fuck him.
Say god damn he did it.

2162
01:43:49,351 --> 01:43:50,184
I could do it too.
You can see the amount of energy can be 

2163
01:43:52,521 --> 01:43:56,300
put into both ways of thinking about it,
but one way is so much more positive for

2164
01:43:56,301 --> 01:43:57,134
you and for everybody around you and 
still allows you to have a competitive 

2165
01:44:00,711 --> 01:44:02,810
instinct because you're still competing 
against yourself.

2166
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:03,793
You competing to do better,
but you're looking at the people around 

2167
01:44:05,811 --> 01:44:08,360
you as inspiration rather than its 
competition,

2168
01:44:08,570 --> 01:44:10,280
and so you,
instead of having this negative,

2169
01:44:10,281 --> 01:44:12,350
combative relationship with everybody 
around you,

2170
01:44:12,351 --> 01:44:15,650
that's also succeeding you have is 
really cooperative,

2171
01:44:15,680 --> 01:44:17,390
excited,
feeling about it.

2172
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:18,650
You know what I mean?
That's,

2173
01:44:18,650 --> 01:44:23,060
that's entirely possible in in business.
That's entirely possible and friendship.

2174
01:44:23,090 --> 01:44:27,020
It's like that's how people should try.
They should aspire to interact,

2175
01:44:27,410 --> 01:44:28,243
interface with things,
always try to be as positive as you can 

2176
01:44:30,710 --> 01:44:31,543
to give the same amount of energy you 
can give towards positive and still 

2177
01:44:34,820 --> 01:44:35,653
fulfill all those same amount of 
instincts of like kicking ass and doing 

2178
01:44:38,751 --> 01:44:41,720
well or do it against yourself,
like compete against yourself.

2179
01:44:41,780 --> 01:44:42,613
Don't think about it as those other 
people are taking something away from 

2180
01:44:44,481 --> 01:44:45,314
you.
Think about as they're giving you an 

2181
01:44:46,161 --> 01:44:47,840
opportunity to look at what's possible.

2182
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:48,673
If you really dedicate yourself and you 
should choose that as a valuable life 

2183
01:44:51,411 --> 01:44:52,550
lesson like,
wow,

2184
01:44:52,551 --> 01:44:53,384
look at that guy doing so well or look 
at this girl like kicking ass and doing 

2185
01:44:56,181 --> 01:44:57,600
all this.
How does she accomplish that?

2186
01:44:57,601 --> 01:45:00,200
As you write all those things,
how does she make all these movies?

2187
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:02,510
How does she do all these things like 
fuck,

2188
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:03,673
but people don't do that.
The natural instinct is to look at 

2189
01:45:05,181 --> 01:45:10,181
someone who's like some crazy,
like super competitive person,

2190
01:45:10,341 --> 01:45:12,620
like the rock or something like that.
Like you see the raW,

2191
01:45:12,621 --> 01:45:14,660
he's in everything.
He's in everything.

2192
01:45:14,870 --> 01:45:17,570
You want to shit on him,
but he's such a nice guy.

2193
01:45:17,571 --> 01:45:20,870
You can't.
It's a real problem that he could do.

2194
01:45:21,020 --> 01:45:23,450
That guy could do terrible movie after 
terrible movie.

2195
01:45:23,451 --> 01:45:25,580
No one cares because you such a good 
guy.

2196
01:45:27,110 --> 01:45:29,150
You could.
He could do whatever he wants.

2197
01:45:29,450 --> 01:45:31,640
He seemed like a nice guy.
He's a very nice guy.

2198
01:45:32,090 --> 01:45:34,940
He's a and he's the real deal.
That's really what he does.

2199
01:45:35,150 --> 01:45:35,983
I mean,
that guy really does show up at a 

2200
01:45:36,771 --> 01:45:38,780
fucking hotel room.
Four o'clock in the morning,

2201
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:41,660
flies across the world and immediately 
starts working out.

2202
01:45:41,990 --> 01:45:44,230
Wow.
He's an animal like a lead.

2203
01:45:44,570 --> 01:45:45,403
You want to be inspired.
That guy's worth more money than 

2204
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:48,673
everyone.
He makes more money than anybody that's 

2205
01:45:50,571 --> 01:45:53,180
ever made any money in movies.
He's fucking junk or not.

2206
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:55,910
he's so out of control.
Every movie does as a blockbuster.

2207
01:45:56,390 --> 01:46:01,000
Meanwhile,
he still shows up at a place they got to

2208
01:46:01,001 --> 01:46:01,834
fucking dig,
got one of them elliptical machines 

2209
01:46:03,651 --> 01:46:05,440
waiting for him.
They got weights,

2210
01:46:05,480 --> 01:46:06,313
weight,
and for him he goes to town to do like 

2211
01:46:08,511 --> 01:46:11,960
45 minutes of cardio when he fucking 
land flying across the world,

2212
01:46:12,200 --> 01:46:14,630
lift weights for an hour.
Like He just keeps going.

2213
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:17,180
He just keeps going.
He finds a way to not complain,

2214
01:46:17,330 --> 01:46:18,163
stay positive and just keep going.
I would have read half of his book and 

2215
01:46:22,431 --> 01:46:25,800
I'm very like,
that's a lot for you.

2216
01:46:26,050 --> 01:46:27,250
I remember that.
Um,

2217
01:46:27,380 --> 01:46:28,213
when you,
when he was third string playing 

2218
01:46:30,680 --> 01:46:32,910
football in Canada,
he was living up,

2219
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:37,130
it will show the mattress with the guy 
who got kicked out of a team.

2220
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:40,610
Jesus fog to be a superstar.
I mean,

2221
01:46:40,611 --> 01:46:42,530
I don't even know how many millions he 
makes a movie,

2222
01:46:42,531 --> 01:46:46,250
but everybody sees his movies.
He's such a good guy.

2223
01:46:46,251 --> 01:46:47,084
But here,
here's,

2224
01:46:47,120 --> 01:46:50,250
be really clear,
that kind of genetics,

2225
01:46:50,850 --> 01:46:54,630
like what that guy is that is just like 
we were talking about with Iceland.

2226
01:46:54,750 --> 01:46:55,583
That's the same shit.
That's the same shit with the pacific 

2227
01:46:57,961 --> 01:46:58,561
islands,
man.

2228
01:46:58,561 --> 01:47:02,280
That's some warrior dna son.
That's a giant man.

2229
01:47:02,670 --> 01:47:03,503
That's a huge,
super powerful man who fucking is so 

2230
01:47:07,261 --> 01:47:10,530
driven like we are lucky.
We are lucky.

2231
01:47:10,531 --> 01:47:11,364
That dude is not on the biggest fucking 
horse he could find with the biggest 

2232
01:47:14,221 --> 01:47:15,054
battle ax.
I mean that's what these people come 

2233
01:47:18,421 --> 01:47:19,254
from,
man.

2234
01:47:20,010 --> 01:47:23,620
You don't get to be that big if you 
don't have like some sort of a,

2235
01:47:23,720 --> 01:47:28,530
a great lineage of warriors behind you.
You mean this,

2236
01:47:28,770 --> 01:47:32,280
that's so much bigger than most people 
because the schwarzenegger,

2237
01:47:32,540 --> 01:47:33,373
he's so big,
but all those guys like that guy that 

2238
01:47:35,521 --> 01:47:36,354
plays the mountain on game of thrones.
Like what in the holy fuck that guy so 

2239
01:47:40,981 --> 01:47:41,814
big.
You know the dat dude came out of some 

2240
01:47:44,760 --> 01:47:45,593
warrior bloodline,
some crazy viking blood line because 

2241
01:47:49,110 --> 01:47:52,020
before guns,
that was what was most important.

2242
01:47:52,110 --> 01:47:55,110
So when you see a guy like the rock or 
you see a guy and you're like,

2243
01:47:55,111 --> 01:47:56,760
wow,
that guy looks like a conqueror.

2244
01:47:56,820 --> 01:47:57,653
Yeah,
because that's what he comes from 100 

2245
01:47:58,891 --> 01:47:59,724
percent.
Like is a worry warrior that due to 

2246
01:48:01,531 --> 01:48:03,720
place store.
What's that dude's name?

2247
01:48:03,721 --> 01:48:06,270
Chris hemsworth is home worth that.
That dude.

2248
01:48:06,360 --> 01:48:07,193
Listen

2249
01:48:08,720 --> 01:48:09,870
that,
that dude.

2250
01:48:10,380 --> 01:48:12,440
He's a goddamn specimen.
Or aqua man.

2251
01:48:12,700 --> 01:48:13,533
What is this jamie?
Body comparison of the rocK to the 

2252
01:48:15,761 --> 01:48:16,594
mountain.
Who is the mountain mountains behind 

2253
01:48:18,161 --> 01:48:19,720
them?
One hundred 50 pounds on him.

2254
01:48:20,020 --> 01:48:21,110
Oh my god.
Oh,

2255
01:48:21,160 --> 01:48:22,900
the mountain from game of thrones.
Oh,

2256
01:48:22,901 --> 01:48:25,150
sorry.
Holy shit.

2257
01:48:25,270 --> 01:48:27,130
Put that again.
Look how much bigger he is.

2258
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:28,353
That's like,

2259
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:32,130
that's significant.
Integrate like six,

2260
01:48:32,140 --> 01:48:34,680
seven inches.
He's so big.

2261
01:48:34,870 --> 01:48:35,670
A guy.
So big.

2262
01:48:35,670 --> 01:48:39,120
I'll tell you the six,
nine or some shit.

2263
01:48:39,121 --> 01:48:39,620
Yeah.
Six.

2264
01:48:39,620 --> 01:48:40,970
Nine.
Dude,

2265
01:48:40,980 --> 01:48:43,740
that is so crazy.
I weigh more than both of them.

2266
01:48:44,550 --> 01:48:45,900
That's not true.
Oh,

2267
01:48:45,901 --> 01:48:49,890
well no.
The mountain weighs like three 93.

2268
01:48:49,891 --> 01:48:52,080
80 six.
Three 86.

2269
01:48:52,200 --> 01:48:54,900
He's six foot nine.
He weighs 386 pounds.

2270
01:48:55,580 --> 01:48:59,940
Like to put that in perspective.
A former world boxing champion.

2271
01:49:00,330 --> 01:49:03,840
um,
fuck is his name.

2272
01:49:03,900 --> 01:49:07,030
The crazy gypsy dude.
I'm sorry chris.

2273
01:49:07,060 --> 01:49:07,893
I know the guy.
He's the last guy to beat vladimir 

2274
01:49:11,971 --> 01:49:13,710
klitschko.
God damn it.

2275
01:49:13,711 --> 01:49:18,070
How am I not remembering his name?
Tyson fury,

2276
01:49:18,760 --> 01:49:19,510
right?
Yes,

2277
01:49:19,510 --> 01:49:20,560
that's it.
Sorry tyson.

2278
01:49:21,090 --> 01:49:23,110
That guy's a beast.
Tyson fury.

2279
01:49:23,140 --> 01:49:28,140
He's six foot nine and he weighs 2:50
fam and he's a world boxing champion.

2280
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:32,560
He,
he gave up the title,

2281
01:49:32,620 --> 01:49:34,780
he was going through some struggles,
some health struggles,

2282
01:49:34,900 --> 01:49:39,900
some mental health struggles too,
and gained a shitload of weight and then

2283
01:49:40,220 --> 01:49:41,053
he got real fat and then got all the way
down to like a super healthy way to get 

2284
01:49:45,630 --> 01:49:48,010
an.
I don't know if he's box since I feel

2285
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:52,390
like he has shit.
Find out if he's box since.

2286
01:49:52,710 --> 01:49:55,240
When was the last time he boxed?
But he's going to bok soon.

2287
01:49:55,241 --> 01:49:57,490
I know.
and he looks he's in phenomenal shape.

2288
01:49:57,600 --> 01:49:58,433
So when was the last time he fought?
There's the wikipedia say I feel like 

2289
01:50:01,691 --> 01:50:02,524
the last time he fought his,
when he outpointed vladimir klitschko 

2290
01:50:04,990 --> 01:50:07,210
and then afterwards he had a real 
struggle.

2291
01:50:08,110 --> 01:50:09,760
Maybe just because all of a suDden it 
became,

2292
01:50:09,761 --> 01:50:13,240
the champion is freaking out and maybe 
partying too much or something.

2293
01:50:14,380 --> 01:50:15,400
Uh,
in june.

2294
01:50:15,610 --> 01:50:16,990
He fought just recently,
right?

2295
01:50:17,070 --> 01:50:19,180
Yep.
Was literally last month.

2296
01:50:19,220 --> 01:50:20,080
Yeah.
Yeah.

2297
01:50:20,081 --> 01:50:22,540
And who did he beat?
Suffer severe.

2298
01:50:22,960 --> 01:50:26,080
Did he beat him by decision?
Uh,

2299
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:32,880
doesn't say,
where is it?

2300
01:50:34,020 --> 01:50:37,330
Decision.
Rtd round for.

2301
01:50:37,360 --> 01:50:42,360
What does that mean,
referee something technical dakota?

2302
01:50:43,660 --> 01:50:46,480
No,
because it's td technical decision.

2303
01:50:46,720 --> 01:50:47,553
Maybe it's a.
If someone got headbutted and they got 

2304
01:50:49,061 --> 01:50:50,650
cut,
what happened?

2305
01:50:50,950 --> 01:50:53,710
So find out what happened in that fight.
So you just google the fight.

2306
01:50:53,740 --> 01:50:55,030
We'll figure out what happened.
Anyway,

2307
01:50:55,090 --> 01:50:57,130
if you go to his instagram page,
he's jack now.

2308
01:50:57,240 --> 01:50:59,740
Shredded six pack pang pang.
Pang looks great,

2309
01:51:00,130 --> 01:51:00,963
but you gotta think he's 2:50.
That big motherfucker who's the same 

2310
01:51:03,731 --> 01:51:07,660
height as him is a hundred and 40 pounds
heavier than him.

2311
01:51:07,890 --> 01:51:11,350
Just saying that as that is fucking 
insane.

2312
01:51:11,650 --> 01:51:14,710
that's so big.
Hundred 40 stakes.

2313
01:51:15,540 --> 01:51:18,820
Take 140 t-bones.
Just slap them all over.

2314
01:51:18,821 --> 01:51:23,740
That dude's bought it.
Just shocked that I used to be.

2315
01:51:23,741 --> 01:51:26,160
Everything will be doing before acting 
doorman.

2316
01:51:26,170 --> 01:51:28,480
Someone smashed when people just 
randomly.

2317
01:51:29,260 --> 01:51:31,240
I don't know man.
I don't know about anywhere,

2318
01:51:31,241 --> 01:51:32,710
man.
He's the world's strongest man though,

2319
01:51:32,711 --> 01:51:34,360
is one of those guys.
He does those worlds.

2320
01:51:34,361 --> 01:51:37,710
Strongman competitions together.
Fucking straw.

2321
01:51:37,940 --> 01:51:38,773
The handles on the logs.
They horst along fat twin after fourth 

2322
01:51:41,561 --> 01:51:41,940
round.

2323
01:51:41,940 --> 01:51:43,750
Say that again.
The guy retired after the fourth.

2324
01:51:43,810 --> 01:51:44,940
Oh,
the guy retire.

2325
01:51:44,980 --> 01:51:47,290
So he retired on his stool?
No.

2326
01:51:47,560 --> 01:51:50,500
So he said no mas sound like it was an 
interesting event.

2327
01:51:51,120 --> 01:51:54,180
Was getting pissed and there was a fight
with stand by.

2328
01:51:54,300 --> 01:51:57,640
Was the Crowd getting pissed because the
fight stopped because dude quit.

2329
01:51:57,970 --> 01:52:00,190
Tyson fury is a beast.
He's a really good boxer.

2330
01:52:00,910 --> 01:52:01,760
But um,
you know,

2331
01:52:02,020 --> 01:52:07,020
he came up to weigh over 300 pounds,
got real fat and then lost it all,

2332
01:52:07,240 --> 01:52:08,073
got down to 2:50.
He's smiling and laughing on his 

2333
01:52:10,601 --> 01:52:12,130
instagram.
So like you figured it out.

2334
01:52:12,220 --> 01:52:14,200
Like I like that.
Like when someone goes to the park,

2335
01:52:14,210 --> 01:52:18,450
lands then comes back.
He's a big fucker.

2336
01:52:18,460 --> 01:52:21,520
Look how tall he is.
Six nine.

2337
01:52:21,580 --> 01:52:24,310
And he can box his ass off.
He's very slick,

2338
01:52:24,340 --> 01:52:26,650
like deceptively slick.
You know,

2339
01:52:26,651 --> 01:52:28,570
he's a traveler.
He's like one of them.

2340
01:52:28,570 --> 01:52:29,403
Bad ass gypsy dudes.
Like there's quite a few of those in 

2341
01:52:31,331 --> 01:52:32,164
boxing right now.
These are tough fucking people and he 

2342
01:52:37,451 --> 01:52:40,110
can perform under pressure to like,
he,

2343
01:52:40,111 --> 01:52:41,920
he gets loose.
This huge man.

2344
01:52:41,980 --> 01:52:44,350
He's so big dude.
Kenny box.

2345
01:52:44,410 --> 01:52:47,780
He can box hIs ass off man.
I just don't know why this guy.

2346
01:52:47,810 --> 01:52:48,643
So they're just standing in front of 
each other and like they were fucking 

2347
01:52:49,971 --> 01:52:52,950
around like two rounds and then he 
landed some blows.

2348
01:52:53,250 --> 01:52:54,083
Go down here and see what happens.
Let's see what happens at the end 

2349
01:52:57,920 --> 01:53:00,350
because if the guy just quit and there 
was no,

2350
01:53:00,890 --> 01:53:05,300
there was no poInt where he was hurt 
then it's disgraceful stuff.

2351
01:53:05,860 --> 01:53:09,110
So he's beating them up here?
Yeah.

2352
01:53:09,111 --> 01:53:10,990
Well tyson fury.
So yeah,

2353
01:53:11,030 --> 01:53:11,863
he's fucking him up.
He's of the jet woRld championship 

2354
01:53:13,911 --> 01:53:18,470
caliber boxer.
He beat vladimir klitschko in his prime.

2355
01:53:18,650 --> 01:53:19,483
I mean at the end of his reign,
but he was still in his prime because 

2356
01:53:21,741 --> 01:53:23,000
his next fight against anthony.

2357
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:26,060
Joshua was fantastic.
Klitschko knocked joshua down,

2358
01:53:26,061 --> 01:53:27,920
had joshua deep,
deep trouble.

2359
01:53:28,070 --> 01:53:32,030
And then joshua came back and stopped 
him and joshua knocked him down first.

2360
01:53:32,031 --> 01:53:34,520
Then he knocked joshua down second.
So it was like anthony.

2361
01:53:34,521 --> 01:53:36,680
Joshua was clearly,
if not the best,

2362
01:53:36,890 --> 01:53:37,723
at least it's between him and deontay 
wilder right now until they fight the 

2363
01:53:41,150 --> 01:53:43,700
best,
most dangerous heavyweights of our era.

2364
01:53:43,970 --> 01:53:46,370
And klitschko almost beat him,
almost knocked him out.

2365
01:53:46,550 --> 01:53:47,383
So when tyson fury beat him,
before that he was beating a prime time 

2366
01:53:50,271 --> 01:53:53,630
klitschko and he just outboxed him man.
So the dude just quit.

2367
01:53:54,360 --> 01:53:55,980
What was he good?
Was he getting beat up our.

2368
01:53:56,030 --> 01:53:58,340
I was talking too much.
No,

2369
01:53:58,450 --> 01:53:59,660
go a little bit.
A little bit more.

2370
01:54:00,710 --> 01:54:03,500
So is the end of the round all the 
highlights.

2371
01:54:03,501 --> 01:54:05,750
I mean theY probably should.
Yeah,

2372
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:07,130
he,
he was getting hurt.

2373
01:54:07,550 --> 01:54:09,350
He was gettIng hurt for sure.
He right there.

2374
01:54:09,351 --> 01:54:11,060
He got hurt.
But,

2375
01:54:11,150 --> 01:54:13,170
but you gotta you gotta,
you know,

2376
01:54:13,190 --> 01:54:16,250
try to figure out a way to mitigate 
this.

2377
01:54:16,280 --> 01:54:17,960
You know,
you've got to figure out when.

2378
01:54:18,610 --> 01:54:20,530
I mean he's going back to his,
his corner.

2379
01:54:20,531 --> 01:54:21,364
He's not wobbling.
You're supposed to be trying to figure 

2380
01:54:23,781 --> 01:54:26,360
out a way to get past that dude.
And if you can't figure out a way to get

2381
01:54:26,361 --> 01:54:27,194
past that,
dude,

2382
01:54:27,530 --> 01:54:28,363
why'd you take the fight?

2383
01:54:30,650 --> 01:54:31,483
But I guess I guess he probably thought 
he could beat that guy before he got in 

2384
01:54:34,641 --> 01:54:35,474
with them.
And then while you're in the middle of 

2385
01:54:36,201 --> 01:54:37,034
it,
you know what happens?

2386
01:54:37,130 --> 01:54:39,320
Who that happens to?
Loma chanko,

2387
01:54:39,380 --> 01:54:40,700
lemme chanko.
God's just quit.

2388
01:54:41,270 --> 01:54:43,520
Guys quit on their corner,
worldclass guys,

2389
01:54:43,521 --> 01:54:44,720
they're on their corner and they just 
go,

2390
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:46,940
fuck this.
I'm not going back out there.

2391
01:54:47,120 --> 01:54:50,510
There was like one of his more recent 
fights against a really high level guy,

2392
01:54:51,020 --> 01:54:52,250
loma checkers.
So good.

2393
01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:55,100
He boxes guys out so convinced and 
they're like,

2394
01:54:55,130 --> 01:54:56,030
look,
I'm going out.

2395
01:54:56,140 --> 01:54:58,640
Like this guy keeps teeing off of me.
I'm not making it.

2396
01:54:58,850 --> 01:54:59,683
We're cutting the shit short right here.
And they'll do it with a straight face 

2397
01:55:03,270 --> 01:55:06,110
but like enough of this,
but that's because he's so much better.

2398
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:08,150
Like what you've seen with tyson fury 
there.

2399
01:55:08,151 --> 01:55:08,984
That guy was definitely getting beat up 
and maybe he definitely needed to stop 

2400
01:55:11,451 --> 01:55:12,284
that fight,
but the way he's getting beat up is not 

2401
01:55:15,261 --> 01:55:17,120
like the same way loma chanko does.

2402
01:55:17,150 --> 01:55:20,240
Like when loma triangle does.
It looks like the end is near son.

2403
01:55:20,480 --> 01:55:23,660
You better get off this fucking train.
We're going right into a brick wall.

2404
01:55:23,750 --> 01:55:25,880
You think their mind's not in it when 
you just give up.

2405
01:55:26,030 --> 01:55:28,130
Who knows man,
I mean we didn't watch the actual fight.

2406
01:55:28,280 --> 01:55:30,170
He might've tyson fury,
most likely,

2407
01:55:30,171 --> 01:55:32,790
I think probably hit them with some big 
shots and you know,

2408
01:55:32,830 --> 01:55:34,820
we're looking at it from an outside 
perspective,

2409
01:55:34,821 --> 01:55:36,890
but he knows he's in big,
big trouble.

2410
01:55:37,070 --> 01:55:37,903
It's a smart move.
I mean people get they boo and they get 

2411
01:55:39,861 --> 01:55:43,350
angry when someone who's a real warrior 
steps out of fight,

2412
01:55:43,351 --> 01:55:44,010
but I can

2413
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:47,430
remember when nigel benn fought gerald 
mcclellan and it was a big,

2414
01:55:47,431 --> 01:55:48,264
big fight at the time because they were 
both just knockout artists and crazy 

2415
01:55:50,821 --> 01:55:51,654
wild dudes with ferocious punching power
and gerald mcclellan cut a shit ton of 

2416
01:55:56,401 --> 01:55:57,234
weight,
really way too much weight and he was a 

2417
01:55:59,221 --> 01:56:00,054
really big light heavyweight and when he
went in there and fought gerald 

2418
01:56:03,481 --> 01:56:06,120
mcclellan or when he fought a nodule 
band,

2419
01:56:06,121 --> 01:56:06,954
rather,
they had a clash of heads and it was a 

2420
01:56:08,521 --> 01:56:12,810
crazy like nonstop first round action 
where jeremy mclellan hurt.

2421
01:56:12,811 --> 01:56:15,920
Nigel benn see if he could find that.
Jeremy clough,

2422
01:56:16,170 --> 01:56:17,003
gerald mcclellan hurt nigel benn knocked
him through the ropes and looked like 

2423
01:56:19,501 --> 01:56:22,350
the fight was over and nigel band comes 
back.

2424
01:56:22,500 --> 01:56:23,333
He gets back up and they're going at it 
and there's a crazy headbutting there 

2425
01:56:26,161 --> 01:56:26,994
too,
and during the headbutt I mean they're 

2426
01:56:28,111 --> 01:56:28,944
throwing bombs back and forth,
but I'm gerald mcclellan takes a knee 

2427
01:56:32,850 --> 01:56:37,070
shortly afterwards and then goes to his 
corner and stops and the,

2428
01:56:37,120 --> 01:56:40,020
the people that are watching,
I remember saying like,

2429
01:56:40,021 --> 01:56:43,080
why is he doing that?
Like why would he stop a fight like that

2430
01:56:43,210 --> 01:56:44,850
doesn't make any sense.
And then boom,

2431
01:56:45,400 --> 01:56:46,680
he,
he's fucked.

2432
01:56:46,770 --> 01:56:50,450
And then they take them to the hospital.
And this is it.

2433
01:56:51,030 --> 01:56:52,860
This is what says around 10,
right before,

2434
01:56:52,861 --> 01:56:55,230
I think this is right before the 
headbutt.

2435
01:56:55,290 --> 01:56:57,480
Yeah.
So during the first round,

2436
01:56:57,540 --> 01:56:58,373
I see,
I thought it was a shorter fight 

2437
01:56:59,180 --> 01:57:01,920
through.
During the first round they had collided

2438
01:57:03,180 --> 01:57:04,013
and gerald mcclellan hit him with some 
big shots and it looked like the fight 

2439
01:57:07,321 --> 01:57:08,154
was over.
I'm pretty sure that was the first 

2440
01:57:08,821 --> 01:57:11,220
round.
But when,

2441
01:57:12,810 --> 01:57:14,580
when whatever happened happened.
Oh,

2442
01:57:14,581 --> 01:57:16,420
look at that right hand by nigel pen.
Oh,

2443
01:57:16,440 --> 01:57:18,110
that's ferocious.
Oh dude.

2444
01:57:18,111 --> 01:57:19,650
See,
I totally remember this wrong.

2445
01:57:21,540 --> 01:57:24,030
I remember a clash of heads.
Look at that.

2446
01:57:24,031 --> 01:57:24,864
I though,
man.

2447
01:57:27,710 --> 01:57:28,760
Damn,
I 100 percent.

2448
01:57:28,761 --> 01:57:29,630
Remember this wrong,
see,

2449
01:57:29,660 --> 01:57:34,660
because he got up and he's in trouble,
and nigel ben's hitting them again.

2450
01:57:35,840 --> 01:57:36,680
See,
I don't remember him.

2451
01:57:36,760 --> 01:57:38,270
See,
that's interesting how that works,

2452
01:57:38,290 --> 01:57:40,090
man.
You haven't seen a fight in 20 years and

2453
01:57:40,091 --> 01:57:42,250
you have this stupid memory to have it 
in your head.

2454
01:57:42,520 --> 01:57:44,080
Oh,
look at that upper cut he hit him with.

2455
01:57:44,970 --> 01:57:45,803
So I think this is the end of the fight.
So I think he was a greeley struggling 

2456
01:57:50,451 --> 01:57:55,451
at this point.
I think he waited out his whole count.

2457
01:57:57,210 --> 01:57:58,043
That's it.
He waited out his whole count on his 

2458
01:57:59,371 --> 01:58:03,780
knee and I think some people were 
critical of that at the time.

2459
01:58:05,270 --> 01:58:06,560
This is crazy,
man.

2460
01:58:10,870 --> 01:58:12,940
So anyway,
after this fight,

2461
01:58:12,941 --> 01:58:13,774
gerald mcclellan had severe brain 
bleeding and was taken to the hospital 

2462
01:58:18,550 --> 01:58:20,200
and he's never been the same sense.

2463
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:25,420
Batman nodule ban was a beast man.
They were both beasts.

2464
01:58:25,421 --> 01:58:28,300
Gerald mcclellan was a knock out artist 
at the time.

2465
01:58:28,301 --> 01:58:31,300
Man.
See if you google jeremy mclellan,

2466
01:58:31,420 --> 01:58:32,253
kao highlights the.
The thought was that it was going to be 

2467
01:58:34,570 --> 01:58:37,780
one day joe mcclellen versus Roy Jones 
jr.

2468
01:58:37,820 --> 01:58:40,810
They were going to have a super fight.
That was like a big,

2469
01:58:40,980 --> 01:58:41,813
like one of them pack.
Y'all may weather type fights for that 

2470
01:58:43,961 --> 01:58:44,741
era.
Wow,

2471
01:58:44,741 --> 01:58:45,730
man.
He got hit hard.

2472
01:58:45,731 --> 01:58:46,564
Man.
Ain't hard getting hit in the face like 

2473
01:58:48,011 --> 01:58:50,710
that.
Why do I remember him getting head?

2474
01:58:51,430 --> 01:58:54,880
Maybe I'm just completely delusional or 
maybe that was somewhere in that mix,

2475
01:58:54,881 --> 01:58:59,881
but certainly it was the big bombs from 
mcclellan that,

2476
01:59:00,420 --> 01:59:01,253
uh,
dropped him in the first round and the 

2477
01:59:03,401 --> 01:59:04,234
big bombs from nigel benn.
I want to see the first round too 

2478
01:59:06,631 --> 01:59:07,464
because from I remember it,
it was a crazy comeback because nigel 

2479
01:59:10,271 --> 01:59:13,000
benn was really hurt and that first 
round,

2480
01:59:13,030 --> 01:59:13,863
but just showed insane heart and figured
out how to keep going where a lot of 

2481
01:59:18,941 --> 01:59:20,830
people like this fight is over.
This fight is over.

2482
01:59:23,470 --> 01:59:24,550
But you see in those,
uh,

2483
01:59:24,580 --> 01:59:26,510
highlight reels.
He was a knockout artist man.

2484
01:59:26,740 --> 01:59:28,150
But now he's,
he's in real,

2485
01:59:28,151 --> 01:59:28,871
real,
real,

2486
01:59:28,871 --> 01:59:31,360
real bad shape.
He's in a wheelchair.

2487
01:59:31,870 --> 01:59:33,610
He from that fight.
He,

2488
01:59:33,630 --> 01:59:35,500
he went blind.
He,

2489
01:59:35,501 --> 01:59:36,334
uh,
he had severe bleeding on his brain and 

2490
01:59:38,681 --> 01:59:41,500
it never really recovered.
He could have died in the ring.

2491
01:59:41,710 --> 01:59:43,150
Oh,
he absolutely could have died.

2492
01:59:43,240 --> 01:59:45,100
So here's the first route,
look at this first round,

2493
01:59:45,130 --> 01:59:49,210
insane you're going to with nigel benn 
falls through the ropes.

2494
01:59:49,211 --> 01:59:50,410
Go,
go back a little bit,

2495
01:59:50,440 --> 01:59:53,220
go back a little bit so you could see 
how fucking insane this.

2496
01:59:53,230 --> 01:59:54,730
Go.
Go to the beginning of it.

2497
01:59:55,270 --> 01:59:57,640
You see how insane this combination is.
I mean,

2498
01:59:57,641 --> 01:59:58,474
mcclellan came out,
guns blazing and hit him with some 

2499
02:00:01,420 --> 02:00:03,040
serious bombs.
Man,

2500
02:00:03,430 --> 02:00:06,020
look at this.
He hit him with a couple of good shot.

2501
02:00:06,021 --> 02:00:07,300
They're good,
right hand,

2502
02:00:07,330 --> 02:00:08,830
a good lead hook left hook to the body.

2503
02:00:08,830 --> 02:00:10,540
So this is the beginning of the fight.
You're thinking,

2504
02:00:10,541 --> 02:00:13,420
oh my god,
this is fucking over.

2505
02:00:13,600 --> 02:00:15,580
Look at that left hook,
left hook to the body.

2506
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:17,070
Boom,
boom.

2507
02:00:17,090 --> 02:00:17,923
I mean mclennan was a destroyer.
Look at this and this is when he's 

2508
02:00:20,261 --> 02:00:22,720
blasting them through the ropes.
You're like,

2509
02:00:22,721 --> 02:00:25,660
holy shit.
This fight is over.

2510
02:00:25,990 --> 02:00:29,590
Nigel benn comes back from this to win 
like 10 rounds later,

2511
02:00:29,591 --> 02:00:31,750
which is insane.
Insane.

2512
02:00:32,710 --> 02:00:34,000
Look at them.
I mean clearly he's hurt.

2513
02:00:34,040 --> 02:00:34,873
He's kinda wobbly.
But jeremy mclellan just couldn't keep 

2514
02:00:39,191 --> 02:00:42,130
this up.
Nigel benn survived and came back.

2515
02:00:42,460 --> 02:00:45,730
Those are Like mad and tangibles in a 
fight.

2516
02:00:45,760 --> 02:00:46,593
That's why the best description of 
fights is always the theater of the 

2517
02:00:49,211 --> 02:00:52,690
unknown because you really never know 
what the fuck is going to happen.

2518
02:00:52,960 --> 02:00:53,793
When did you get these two world class 
knuckle slingers throwing fucking 

2519
02:00:58,541 --> 02:01:00,790
haymakers at each of the slickest 
mcclellan.

2520
02:01:01,560 --> 02:01:02,381
Oh,
not Japan.

2521
02:01:02,381 --> 02:01:05,950
Comes back with a right and he clenches 
now.

2522
02:01:05,970 --> 02:01:07,720
Mclaughlin starting to get a little 
tired,

2523
02:01:08,590 --> 02:01:09,740
right?
Knees.

2524
02:01:09,790 --> 02:01:11,040
They're given up.
I'm to kinda.

2525
02:01:11,260 --> 02:01:12,093
Yeah,
I mean he's gotta think what kind of 

2526
02:01:13,060 --> 02:01:13,893
output he's putting.
He's trying to win this fight and jail 

2527
02:01:16,801 --> 02:01:18,700
son and told me something once that's,
uh,

2528
02:01:18,880 --> 02:01:21,320
an old boxing,
uh,

2529
02:01:22,150 --> 02:01:22,983
saying something along the lines of if 
you try to stop a fight and win by 

2530
02:01:28,301 --> 02:01:29,134
knockout but fail,
you almost always lose by decision 

2531
02:01:31,790 --> 02:01:34,180
because you just blow yourself out so 
bad.

2532
02:01:35,710 --> 02:01:40,280
Obviously that's not totally the case 
because some people have crazy endurance

2533
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:43,760
and they can try to win a fight by 
knockout and then recover around later.

2534
02:01:44,620 --> 02:01:45,453
But did the amount of output that you do
when you're throwing everything full 

2535
02:01:48,651 --> 02:01:51,530
blast like mcclellan did in that first 
round is insane.

2536
02:01:52,310 --> 02:01:54,490
It's like sprinting,
how many punches that up?

2537
02:01:54,610 --> 02:01:56,300
First round,
he threw a lot,

2538
02:01:56,301 --> 02:01:57,134
but here's the most important thing.
He's throwing a lot of them at full 

2539
02:01:59,931 --> 02:02:00,764
power.
That's why it's so difficult to 

2540
02:02:02,331 --> 02:02:03,164
maintain.
What most people don't realize is that 

2541
02:02:05,630 --> 02:02:07,700
most of the time we see boxers,
boxing,

2542
02:02:08,300 --> 02:02:09,133
they're throwing punches fast,
but they're being loose and fluid and 

2543
02:02:14,241 --> 02:02:15,074
when they heard a fighter,
that's when they expend the most energy 

2544
02:02:17,361 --> 02:02:21,140
because then they're digging in and 
drill and blast and they're winding up.

2545
02:02:21,230 --> 02:02:24,650
They don't normally do that,
so the amount of energy that it takes to

2546
02:02:24,651 --> 02:02:25,484
wind up and throw your hips in your 
fucking ass into it and all you're 

2547
02:02:29,061 --> 02:02:31,610
waiting to explode at the end.

2548
02:02:31,760 --> 02:02:34,820
That's much more than to be just a 
technical boxer.

2549
02:02:35,030 --> 02:02:37,910
So when they're throwing technical 
punches and they're moving fast,

2550
02:02:38,360 --> 02:02:39,193
they're.
They're not exerting the same amount of 

2551
02:02:40,461 --> 02:02:41,420
energy.
See,

2552
02:02:41,421 --> 02:02:43,130
when when you're trying to knock 
somebody out,

2553
02:02:43,131 --> 02:02:44,930
like mcclelland clearly wasn't this 
first round.

2554
02:02:45,230 --> 02:02:49,790
You are running uphill with a weight 
sack on your back and you can only do it

2555
02:02:49,791 --> 02:02:52,550
for so long.
So as we go into the second round,

2556
02:02:52,551 --> 02:02:54,740
like look,
you see he's already really tired,

2557
02:02:56,540 --> 02:02:57,373
so it was as much headshot there.
It was as much his weight cut as it was 

2558
02:03:02,360 --> 02:03:03,193
his strategy to try to win the first 
round as it was nigel ben's ability to 

2559
02:03:06,681 --> 02:03:11,000
absorb punishment and come back strong 
because ben is looking fantastic here in

2560
02:03:11,001 --> 02:03:11,834
the second round look at them.
But it was a big wake up call to a lot 

2561
02:03:15,741 --> 02:03:18,710
of boxers that if you engage in wild 
brawls,

2562
02:03:18,711 --> 02:03:20,540
even when you were one of the elite of 
the elite,

2563
02:03:20,780 --> 02:03:24,080
like gerald mcclellan was at the time,
you could still get,

2564
02:03:24,240 --> 02:03:26,330
you know,
brain bleeding and be fucked up.

2565
02:03:26,450 --> 02:03:29,060
And a lot of people attribute that to 
the weight cut because he had a,

2566
02:03:29,061 --> 02:03:29,894
he a dehydrate himself quite a bit back 
then doing his game plan from his 

2567
02:03:32,900 --> 02:03:35,290
coaches.
Get this guy out in the first round.

2568
02:03:35,630 --> 02:03:37,490
It could be,
but it could be that he heard him and he

2569
02:03:37,491 --> 02:03:39,410
figured he could get them out in the 
first round.

2570
02:03:39,440 --> 02:03:41,000
You know what I mean?
Mcclellan was a killer.

2571
02:03:41,060 --> 02:03:42,260
THat was his thing.
If he,

2572
02:03:42,350 --> 02:03:44,030
if he hurt you,
he was coming after you.

2573
02:03:44,390 --> 02:03:47,660
So what's that?
14 straight knockouts and 10 were in the

2574
02:03:47,661 --> 02:03:49,590
first round.
Come on man.

2575
02:03:49,640 --> 02:03:52,880
That's what gerald mcclellan did.
So when it didn't work out against a guy

2576
02:03:52,881 --> 02:03:53,714
like nigel benn,
nigel benn figured out how to maintain 

2577
02:03:55,611 --> 02:03:58,960
his energy better in that fight.
That's a,

2578
02:03:58,990 --> 02:04:01,730
you know,
that's a dangerous strategy.

2579
02:04:02,030 --> 02:04:03,860
Empty all your bullets out in the first 
round.

2580
02:04:04,190 --> 02:04:06,680
He was just on the fence for the first 
three relevant.

2581
02:04:07,520 --> 02:04:09,350
But meanwhile,
like the,

2582
02:04:09,980 --> 02:04:12,620
that's what was his success formula up 
until then.

2583
02:04:12,650 --> 02:04:13,483
you know what I mean?
That was,

2584
02:04:13,540 --> 02:04:15,380
that was what was working.
You don't know.

2585
02:04:15,381 --> 02:04:16,970
It doesn't work until they don't work 
anymore.

2586
02:04:17,030 --> 02:04:18,970
14th street and I called that way.
Yeah,

2587
02:04:19,850 --> 02:04:20,683
I mean do,
do you remember when we used to think 

2588
02:04:21,381 --> 02:04:23,790
that nobody can beat tyson?
Remember?

2589
02:04:24,390 --> 02:04:29,390
Do were little when we were young we 
thought,

2590
02:04:29,580 --> 02:04:32,810
I think it was like,
when did he lose 86?

2591
02:04:32,870 --> 02:04:35,450
did he lose in like 1986 to buster 
douglas?

2592
02:04:35,480 --> 02:04:36,680
Yeah.
What year was that?

2593
02:04:37,100 --> 02:04:39,420
80 nine.
90 google that.

2594
02:04:40,530 --> 02:04:41,970
Um,
he moved.

2595
02:04:42,060 --> 02:04:43,580
He did it.
What it was.

2596
02:04:43,620 --> 02:04:44,453
I was definitely doing comedy at the 
time and I definitely saw it with my 

2597
02:04:48,421 --> 02:04:50,270
friend ron after the fact.
Great.

2598
02:04:50,370 --> 02:04:51,061
Eleventh,
19,

2599
02:04:51,061 --> 02:04:52,440
90,
1990.

2600
02:04:52,980 --> 02:04:56,400
Damn.
So from that point on,

2601
02:04:56,401 --> 02:04:59,670
we knew he could lose before that.
Every tyson fight like,

2602
02:04:59,671 --> 02:05:01,320
man,
I'm not gonna bother watching.

2603
02:05:01,560 --> 02:05:04,800
Why do people want even want to fight 
that guy just getting killed.

2604
02:05:04,940 --> 02:05:08,570
What were the odds of him when he like 
40 to 42 to the one.

2605
02:05:08,740 --> 02:05:11,490
Somebody got paid.
Somebody I paid some crazy number.

2606
02:05:11,491 --> 02:05:12,324
I think it was 42.
I think it was one of the highest 

2607
02:05:14,071 --> 02:05:15,840
underdogs ever.
That one.

2608
02:05:16,710 --> 02:05:19,320
40 2:42
and he won by knockout.

2609
02:05:19,440 --> 02:05:21,990
Buster douglas was fantastic back then,
man.

2610
02:05:22,020 --> 02:05:24,420
You fucked him up.
Well dude,

2611
02:05:24,421 --> 02:05:25,254
buster douglas is a crazy example of a 
guy who always had a tremendous amount 

2612
02:05:28,651 --> 02:05:29,484
of talent.
He was always regarded as like people 

2613
02:05:31,111 --> 02:05:31,944
that were in the know and boxing.
I'd heard them talk about him and they 

2614
02:05:36,901 --> 02:05:37,734
would always talk about how smooth he 
was in training and when he's at his 

2615
02:05:40,711 --> 02:05:43,200
best.
He's literally like a world championship

2616
02:05:43,201 --> 02:05:44,034
fighter,
but he never totally put it together in 

2617
02:05:46,301 --> 02:05:48,420
far as far as discipline and training 
camp,

2618
02:05:48,870 --> 02:05:49,703
but then his mom died and he decided he 
was going to fuck Mike Tyson up for his 

2619
02:05:53,401 --> 02:05:54,234
mother.

2620
02:05:54,930 --> 02:05:56,460
Trained really,
really hard,

2621
02:05:56,461 --> 02:05:59,820
so it was a perfect storm of Mike Tyson 
being king of the world.

2622
02:06:00,300 --> 02:06:02,460
You know,
he's just fucking.

2623
02:06:02,461 --> 02:06:05,460
Everybody up doesn't even feel like he 
has to train anymore.

2624
02:06:05,700 --> 02:06:06,533
He's just just being.
He's just being the world heavyweight 

2625
02:06:10,411 --> 02:06:11,340
champion.
That's what.

2626
02:06:11,400 --> 02:06:12,233
That's what they're like.
The reason why they become that guy in 

2627
02:06:13,561 --> 02:06:14,394
the first place because they have this 
ability to indulge and excess and go 

2628
02:06:17,191 --> 02:06:18,024
crazy.
He's buying tigers and lamborghinis and 

2629
02:06:19,951 --> 02:06:24,900
shit and all along the way,
buster douglas fir that fight train like

2630
02:06:24,901 --> 02:06:28,470
a demon and still almost lost.
Still almost lost.

2631
02:06:28,500 --> 02:06:32,550
That's how good tyson was when tyson was
in his prime is a knockout artist.

2632
02:06:32,551 --> 02:06:37,551
He was so lethal that even though buster
douglas and him fought in bus,

2633
02:06:37,631 --> 02:06:39,540
doug's eventually wind up knocking him 
out.

2634
02:06:39,570 --> 02:06:40,403
He knocked him out after Mike Tyson 
knocked buster douglas down and had him 

2635
02:06:43,381 --> 02:06:46,840
hurt and don king after the fight even 
protested and said that the,

2636
02:06:46,940 --> 02:06:51,120
the count was more than 10 and that when
buster douglas was down,

2637
02:06:51,150 --> 02:06:51,983
the referee gave him an extra couple of 
seconds to recover that he shouldn't 

2638
02:06:54,271 --> 02:06:55,104
have had.

2639
02:06:55,270 --> 02:06:57,720
I remember that was like a big protest 
after the fight,

2640
02:06:59,340 --> 02:07:02,850
but even then,
I mean we even with shitty training,

2641
02:07:03,500 --> 02:07:06,780
you know,
be not taking this guy seriously at all.

2642
02:07:06,840 --> 02:07:07,673
Even then Mike Tyson still knocked 
buster douglas down and almost knocked 

2643
02:07:10,471 --> 02:07:11,850
him out with one punch.
What?

2644
02:07:11,851 --> 02:07:15,450
Run tHe locomote.
wasn't douglas the longest,

2645
02:07:15,680 --> 02:07:17,520
longest tyson fight ever had,
right?

2646
02:07:18,840 --> 02:07:21,080
I know he's had decisions.
He had decisions.

2647
02:07:21,110 --> 02:07:21,943
Yeah.
I think he had decision against bone 

2648
02:07:22,741 --> 02:07:26,250
crusher.
Smith video here as both both knockdowns

2649
02:07:26,670 --> 02:07:27,503
simultaneous.
So you can see like the different 10 

2650
02:07:29,041 --> 02:07:30,300
counts I guess.
Okay.

2651
02:07:30,330 --> 02:07:32,640
Let's say it.
Boom.

2652
02:07:32,700 --> 02:07:34,570
He clipped him an upper cut,
right?

2653
02:07:35,580 --> 02:07:36,090
There's

2654
02:07:36,090 --> 02:07:37,090
three,
four,

2655
02:07:37,400 --> 02:07:39,130
eight.
These atlanta three on the left.

2656
02:07:39,131 --> 02:07:40,840
He's like,
I'm five or six on the right.

2657
02:07:41,020 --> 02:07:42,340
Oh,
that's so different.

2658
02:07:44,670 --> 02:07:45,940
Oh,
that's so different.

2659
02:07:46,780 --> 02:07:49,040
He was cultivated.
Yeah.

2660
02:07:49,300 --> 02:07:50,860
Yeah.
Oh man,

2661
02:07:50,861 --> 02:07:54,080
it was the end of the round was the very
end of the round,

2662
02:07:54,081 --> 02:07:56,840
so buster got a break.
So look that.

2663
02:07:56,860 --> 02:07:57,850
That's just how it go.
Go.

2664
02:07:57,851 --> 02:07:59,560
Go to the very beginning again.
Please take a second.

2665
02:07:59,580 --> 02:08:02,740
Go at the very beginning again so I 
could see the punch right there.

2666
02:08:03,760 --> 02:08:04,910
Boom.
Look at that opera.

2667
02:08:04,930 --> 02:08:09,850
That's a beautiful uppercut.
Tyson nailed them with two to three.

2668
02:08:10,210 --> 02:08:12,220
Four,
five,

2669
02:08:12,430 --> 02:08:14,440
six,
seven,

2670
02:08:14,950 --> 02:08:16,690
eight,
nine,

2671
02:08:16,870 --> 02:08:17,770
10.
You're out.

2672
02:08:17,860 --> 02:08:18,760
You're out.
Buster.

2673
02:08:19,710 --> 02:08:20,680
Buster there.
No,

2674
02:08:20,770 --> 02:08:22,160
he's out.
He's out.

2675
02:08:22,161 --> 02:08:26,110
Like do that again.
That seems like he's out right,

2676
02:08:26,270 --> 02:08:27,050
doesn't it?
Yeah,

2677
02:08:27,050 --> 02:08:28,000
let's try it again.
Ready?

2678
02:08:28,030 --> 02:08:29,380
Boom.
He goes down.

2679
02:08:29,830 --> 02:08:31,630
One,
two,

2680
02:08:32,110 --> 02:08:34,240
three,
four,

2681
02:08:34,810 --> 02:08:36,790
five,
six,

2682
02:08:37,150 --> 02:08:38,980
seven,
eight,

2683
02:08:39,640 --> 02:08:41,230
nine,
10.

2684
02:08:41,650 --> 02:08:43,210
he's out.
Someone's distracted him.

2685
02:08:43,211 --> 02:08:45,040
A number eight.
Yeah.

2686
02:08:45,090 --> 02:08:47,320
Does that stopped the account?
Is that how that works?

2687
02:08:47,360 --> 02:08:51,490
As long as a lot of paul's second when 
it turns her running away.

2688
02:08:52,080 --> 02:08:53,680
Seven,
eight on Mike Tyson here.

2689
02:08:54,220 --> 02:08:56,260
There's five,
six,

2690
02:08:56,560 --> 02:08:58,000
seven,
eight.

2691
02:08:58,090 --> 02:08:59,550
Just like none.
Real quick.

2692
02:08:59,650 --> 02:09:01,120
10.
Yeah,

2693
02:09:01,121 --> 02:09:03,010
that guy's way quicker.
Is that the same guy?

2694
02:09:03,750 --> 02:09:04,960
Oh,
that's ridiculous.

2695
02:09:04,961 --> 02:09:05,794
Dude.
You suck at counting in spanish and 

2696
02:09:10,740 --> 02:09:13,750
other one.
That's a fucking crazy hard job,

2697
02:09:13,751 --> 02:09:15,190
man.
You're in the middle of the moment.

2698
02:09:15,220 --> 02:09:18,640
You know there's all this hype going on 
and pay the fuck out.

2699
02:09:18,940 --> 02:09:21,810
Yeah,
but it's the same guy because a,

2700
02:09:21,850 --> 02:09:24,060
it's the same fight.
So how,

2701
02:09:24,390 --> 02:09:25,223
how does the same guy count?
Real slow for buster douglas and way 

2702
02:09:29,861 --> 02:09:30,694
faster for Mike Tyson.
A description of the video says this 

2703
02:09:32,741 --> 02:09:35,740
clearly demonstrates that he gave them 
both the exact same amount of time.

2704
02:09:36,040 --> 02:09:37,240
Oh really?

2705
02:09:37,300 --> 02:09:39,670
That's not what I thought was.
So let's try that again.

2706
02:09:40,090 --> 02:09:40,923
Let's try that again.
Let's count for tyson will count for 

2707
02:09:44,260 --> 02:09:46,690
tyson first.
Ready tyson goes down.

2708
02:09:46,720 --> 02:09:47,680
Boom.
What a combination.

2709
02:09:47,900 --> 02:09:50,650
Plus two,
3:00,

2710
02:09:50,890 --> 02:09:52,450
four,
five,

2711
02:09:52,750 --> 02:09:54,280
six,
seven,

2712
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:56,530
eight,
nine,

2713
02:09:57,100 --> 02:09:58,660
10,
11,

2714
02:09:59,140 --> 02:10:00,850
12,
13,

2715
02:10:01,180 --> 02:10:02,013
14.
You got knocked down a run around 50 on 

2716
02:10:03,251 --> 02:10:03,971
the,
on the clock.

2717
02:10:03,971 --> 02:10:05,770
On the screen.
You can see it in.

2718
02:10:05,800 --> 02:10:06,633
How many seconds was it a.
He puts them up at 38 is when he knocks 

2719
02:10:10,281 --> 02:10:12,290
on the track right there.
Okay.

2720
02:10:12,610 --> 02:10:14,800
She's like 13 seconds.
Yeah,

2721
02:10:16,230 --> 02:10:18,160
four,
five,

2722
02:10:18,460 --> 02:10:20,530
six,
seven,

2723
02:10:20,950 --> 02:10:22,570
eight,
nine.

2724
02:10:22,930 --> 02:10:23,763
They're both out both out.
Do the counting is definitely slower on 

2725
02:10:30,191 --> 02:10:32,500
buster douglas with.
They're definitely both out,

2726
02:10:33,290 --> 02:10:34,010
but either

2727
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:35,780
way,
if you said seven,

2728
02:10:35,810 --> 02:10:37,840
I bet butts in instead of,
you know,

2729
02:10:37,890 --> 02:10:41,090
for if you've sped the count up by a 
second,

2730
02:10:41,091 --> 02:10:43,040
you don't think buster douglas could've 
gotten up quicker.

2731
02:10:43,400 --> 02:10:46,070
I bet he could have.
I mean he was waiting for the guy to hit

2732
02:10:46,071 --> 02:10:48,290
eight so he stands up.
Right.

2733
02:10:48,410 --> 02:10:51,140
Which what you do,
you take as much time as you can,

2734
02:10:51,141 --> 02:10:53,030
especially after you got legitimately 
hurt like that.

2735
02:10:53,031 --> 02:10:56,180
You're supposed to do that.
So the question is like,

2736
02:10:56,210 --> 02:10:57,043
would he have been able to.
If the guide countered a little quicker 

2737
02:10:59,780 --> 02:11:03,050
and eight came where seven was or six 
was,

2738
02:11:03,080 --> 02:11:03,913
would have been able to.
I think he probabLy would have the 

2739
02:11:05,661 --> 02:11:06,494
questions would have tyson and been able
to get to him with one punch before the 

2740
02:11:09,051 --> 02:11:10,880
bell that might have knocked him out.
Yeah.

2741
02:11:10,980 --> 02:11:11,900
You know.
Okay.

2742
02:11:11,901 --> 02:11:12,734
Fight.
You get them back up again and it's 

2743
02:11:14,031 --> 02:11:15,550
three extra seconds at tyson.

2744
02:11:15,590 --> 02:11:19,880
Storms forward and connects with it to 
head shots with a faithful dude.

2745
02:11:19,940 --> 02:11:21,920
Crazy shots.
There's this guy right here.

2746
02:11:21,921 --> 02:11:24,170
Watch the fight glove.
See the official counters?

2747
02:11:24,171 --> 02:11:25,010
The fda?
Yes.

2748
02:11:25,400 --> 02:11:28,460
This guy that's the finger bro.
He's famous.

2749
02:11:28,461 --> 02:11:30,680
His nickname is the finger.
He counts way faster.

2750
02:11:30,681 --> 02:11:31,820
watch.
Let's watch the finger.

2751
02:11:33,110 --> 02:11:34,790
Two,
three,

2752
02:11:35,270 --> 02:11:37,190
four,
five,

2753
02:11:37,670 --> 02:11:39,500
six,
seven,

2754
02:11:40,010 --> 02:11:41,840
eight,
nine,

2755
02:11:42,110 --> 02:11:43,220
10.
Oh yeah.

2756
02:11:43,221 --> 02:11:46,160
By the fingers count.
That dudes out there both out cold.

2757
02:11:46,190 --> 02:11:50,030
I'm going with the finger forever.
Captain white glove.

2758
02:11:50,390 --> 02:11:51,223
Michael jackson.
Michael jackson will go with mike 

2759
02:11:54,830 --> 02:11:56,600
magician.
Yeah,

2760
02:11:56,601 --> 02:11:57,470
man,
that's a.

2761
02:11:57,500 --> 02:11:58,333
That was an insane fight though because 
you couldn't believe Mike Tyson could 

2762
02:12:00,831 --> 02:12:01,970
lose.
Even when I watched it.

2763
02:12:02,240 --> 02:12:03,073
I remember I heard about it first and 
then I watched it and they still 

2764
02:12:05,781 --> 02:12:08,050
remember thinking,
I can't believe what I'm watching.

2765
02:12:08,060 --> 02:12:10,470
He's going to get up and he's going to 
knock this dude out for sure.

2766
02:12:10,490 --> 02:12:11,930
Believe you lost.
It was like,

2767
02:12:11,931 --> 02:12:12,764
it's over.
Then you couldn't believe that he could 

2768
02:12:13,881 --> 02:12:16,790
lose who that's people don't understand 
today.

2769
02:12:16,791 --> 02:12:17,624
There's never been someone that was as 
dominant for as like a scary moment in 

2770
02:12:23,390 --> 02:12:24,223
boxing history than Mike Tyson because 
even though you knew Roy Jones is gonna 

2771
02:12:27,631 --> 02:12:30,370
fuck up,
whoeveR he found the way he was going to

2772
02:12:30,371 --> 02:12:32,240
fuck off,
but he knocked him out with one punch.

2773
02:12:32,570 --> 02:12:37,570
It wasn't going to be this horrific 
storming by destroyer,

2774
02:12:37,820 --> 02:12:41,630
just common after your soul.
Roy jones had box your face off,

2775
02:12:41,631 --> 02:12:46,430
hit you with the lead left hooks and 
straight right hands that are way faster

2776
02:12:46,431 --> 02:12:48,680
than anything you can duck.
He would fuck people up,

2777
02:12:48,681 --> 02:12:52,250
but he fucked people up with a certain 
style and movement and speed.

2778
02:12:52,430 --> 02:12:56,480
Whereas tyson,
which just mugging you at the same time,

2779
02:12:56,920 --> 02:13:00,660
it's like all anger,
so fast hood and you end.

2780
02:13:00,690 --> 02:13:03,770
He was solid like sledgehammer 220 
pounds,

2781
02:13:03,771 --> 02:13:07,400
but moved like 160 pound guy like he 
couldn't believe it at the time.

2782
02:13:08,250 --> 02:13:10,250
They had never been a heavyweight like 
him before.

2783
02:13:10,430 --> 02:13:11,263
There was heavyweights that that moved 
amazing like ali ali had the most 

2784
02:13:14,421 --> 02:13:15,254
amazing footwork of anybody just smooth 
and flowing and change what the game 

2785
02:13:19,401 --> 02:13:20,840
was.
It was in front of people.

2786
02:13:21,010 --> 02:13:21,843
The ropeadope,
this a crazy video of volley that 

2787
02:13:24,540 --> 02:13:25,373
someone had on their instagram page,
one of those boxing pages where he's 

2788
02:13:29,091 --> 02:13:32,370
fighting someone and the guy throws two,
three,

2789
02:13:32,371 --> 02:13:34,950
four punches in a row and ali's got his 
hands down.

2790
02:13:35,160 --> 02:13:37,770
I just barely moving his head away with 
each punch.

2791
02:13:37,890 --> 02:13:39,300
Just like pitch,
you can't hit me.

2792
02:13:39,630 --> 02:13:40,463
He just had a.
There was a magic about what he was 

2793
02:13:42,811 --> 02:13:43,644
doing that you were like,
how is a heavyweight moving like that 

2794
02:13:47,160 --> 02:13:50,370
tyson jab to tyson was a totally 
different kind of strategy,

2795
02:13:50,860 --> 02:13:51,660
you know,
and those,

2796
02:13:51,660 --> 02:13:53,910
those strategies will be argued to the 
end of time.

2797
02:13:53,910 --> 02:13:56,670
Like what would have happened if Mike 
Tyson had a thought,

2798
02:13:56,671 --> 02:13:58,620
muhammad ali,
both in their primes.

2799
02:13:58,740 --> 02:14:00,480
What would have happened,
man,

2800
02:14:00,481 --> 02:14:02,970
what have happened.
It would have been fucking crazy.

2801
02:14:02,971 --> 02:14:03,804
I'll tell you that if we had Mike Tyson 
in his very best before shit went 

2802
02:14:07,920 --> 02:14:10,680
completely crazy.
He started giving out rolls royces.

2803
02:14:10,681 --> 02:14:14,430
Two cops walking around with his tiger 
in his underwear before all that stuff.

2804
02:14:14,820 --> 02:14:16,270
They.
Yeah,

2805
02:14:16,530 --> 02:14:18,480
before for sure.
Before bite nears.

2806
02:14:19,020 --> 02:14:22,430
The bioneers thing was when amanda was,
you know,

2807
02:14:23,540 --> 02:14:25,080
when a van or beat him in that first 
fight,

2808
02:14:25,110 --> 02:14:27,210
no one could believe it.
No one could believe it.

2809
02:14:27,570 --> 02:14:29,310
Even though tyson did last.
Buster douglas,

2810
02:14:29,520 --> 02:14:30,353
everybody assumed that tyson last 
because he hadn't been training and he 

2811
02:14:32,551 --> 02:14:35,730
really hadn't been been focused and then
when he went to jail,

2812
02:14:36,480 --> 02:14:40,170
came out of jail and he looked jacked 
member way more jacked.

2813
02:14:40,510 --> 02:14:44,790
Hit a ridiculous six pack.
Remember that shit to another phase son.

2814
02:14:44,940 --> 02:14:46,560
Now he got the tattoo on his face 
afterwards,

2815
02:14:46,561 --> 02:14:50,760
right after jail I think at the tattoo.
On his face.

2816
02:14:51,410 --> 02:14:52,243
Angel,
right?

2817
02:14:53,010 --> 02:14:56,130
I don't think so.
I think he had mild tattooed on his arm.

2818
02:14:58,070 --> 02:15:00,200
What does it say here?
Mike tyson opens up.

2819
02:15:00,230 --> 02:15:01,063
Oh,
that was when he got arrested by that 

2820
02:15:02,600 --> 02:15:03,800
joseph though.
Joe,

2821
02:15:03,801 --> 02:15:06,830
our pio guy had to do time in that 
Arizona.

2822
02:15:07,250 --> 02:15:09,320
He was living in Arizona for a while and
he had to do that.

2823
02:15:09,950 --> 02:15:11,180
Joe,
our pio shit,

2824
02:15:11,181 --> 02:15:13,880
when they maKe you wear pink,
got handcuffs on and

2825
02:15:16,160 --> 02:15:16,993
dude.

2826
02:15:17,410 --> 02:15:19,270
Mike Tyson though.
When he was in his prime,

2827
02:15:19,320 --> 02:15:21,040
like that was the one he just got out of
jail.

2828
02:15:21,400 --> 02:15:26,400
That was the Mike Tyson fresh jelic just
act does 95 first fight after release.

2829
02:15:29,500 --> 02:15:30,333
That was against a some unfortunate 
white fella that looks like he would be 

2830
02:15:33,881 --> 02:15:35,110
a.
What was his name?

2831
02:15:35,440 --> 02:15:36,940
Peter mcneely.
Yes.

2832
02:15:37,600 --> 02:15:40,240
Peter mcneely.
Tough guy.

2833
02:15:40,420 --> 02:15:42,970
Just wasn't the video of him talking to 
hype up.

2834
02:15:42,971 --> 02:15:45,040
The fight is hilarious.
You should go watch it now.

2835
02:15:45,060 --> 02:15:46,060
No,
he's hilarious.

2836
02:15:46,210 --> 02:15:48,700
He was like a a guy who'd be carrying 
the money bag.

2837
02:15:50,710 --> 02:15:51,543
He'd be a guy that you'd say bring them 
to peter and peter would break your 

2838
02:15:54,341 --> 02:15:55,450
face.
Hey,

2839
02:15:55,540 --> 02:15:56,920
you owe money.
Fuck,

2840
02:15:57,010 --> 02:16:01,810
boom.
He was a irish guy.

2841
02:16:01,811 --> 02:16:03,310
I remember him.
Give me some volume.

2842
02:16:03,311 --> 02:16:04,144
Jim gray,
looking young and dapper for just a 

2843
02:16:05,141 --> 02:16:06,370
moment.
Before you go out into the ring.

2844
02:16:06,400 --> 02:16:08,090
Your thoughts.
Tyson,

2845
02:16:11,500 --> 02:16:16,100
my grandfather,
my grandmother,

2846
02:16:17,230 --> 02:16:20,020
my father,
my mother,

2847
02:16:24,660 --> 02:16:27,760
my three brothers.
Last but not least,

2848
02:16:28,420 --> 02:16:29,253
snobby.

2849
02:16:33,430 --> 02:16:35,770
Mr mcneely.
what was it that you have told your son?

2850
02:16:35,810 --> 02:16:36,780
Huh?
Whoa,

2851
02:16:36,800 --> 02:16:37,260
whoa,
whoa,

2852
02:16:37,260 --> 02:16:39,370
whoa.
It last but not least.

2853
02:16:39,820 --> 02:16:42,540
Medfield.
Medfield man.

2854
02:16:44,660 --> 02:16:46,860
A guy from medfield.
Dat.

2855
02:16:46,950 --> 02:16:48,060
Dat is a guy from beN.

2856
02:16:48,510 --> 02:16:50,290
if you've ever been to medfield,
Massachusetts.

2857
02:16:50,291 --> 02:16:52,210
No disrespect.
That makes sense.

2858
02:16:53,140 --> 02:16:58,140
Fucking fears in the house.
Dorchester.

2859
02:17:00,800 --> 02:17:03,620
That's hilarious.
Low tough.

2860
02:17:03,920 --> 02:17:04,753
Lowell lowell is a big one.
Man with hardcore micky ward came from 

2861
02:17:07,521 --> 02:17:09,850
lowell.
I want me and my friend jimmy last.

2862
02:17:09,860 --> 02:17:11,660
We saw micky ward box,
somebody,

2863
02:17:12,410 --> 02:17:15,350
some famous dude.
I feel like he bought some old,

2864
02:17:16,010 --> 02:17:16,843
some old time to it.
Jimmy just told me about this recently 

2865
02:17:18,981 --> 02:17:20,060
too,
and I forgot what it was,

2866
02:17:20,360 --> 02:17:24,770
but we were both like,
couldn't have been more than like 19,

2867
02:17:25,040 --> 02:17:25,873
something like that.
We went to see micky ward box was crazy 

2868
02:17:28,971 --> 02:17:30,530
man.
Going to see live boxing.

2869
02:17:30,531 --> 02:17:34,700
So weird because there's no commentary.
Like I'd only seen it at home.

2870
02:17:34,980 --> 02:17:38,150
Do you ever see a live boxing match?
It's weird.

2871
02:17:38,300 --> 02:17:40,190
It's oddly quiet.
You know?

2872
02:17:40,730 --> 02:17:45,730
What does it say greg young that where 
he fought in 95,

2873
02:17:47,150 --> 02:17:48,080
85.
Oh yeah,

2874
02:17:48,081 --> 02:17:50,630
that makes sense.
That's probably exactly it.

2875
02:17:51,040 --> 02:17:52,760
That means I was 18.
Yeah,

2876
02:17:53,830 --> 02:17:55,970
yup.
Yeah.

2877
02:17:55,971 --> 02:17:57,200
Lawrence,
Massachusetts.

2878
02:17:57,201 --> 02:18:00,380
He fought.
I guess it was this guy greg young.

2879
02:18:00,830 --> 02:18:02,990
Why did I think it was an older guy?
A couple more right here,

2880
02:18:02,991 --> 02:18:05,150
I guess in the same spot next year.
Oh,

2881
02:18:05,160 --> 02:18:05,993
okay.

2882
02:18:07,650 --> 02:18:09,920
Yeah.
I don't remember any of those names.

2883
02:18:09,921 --> 02:18:12,350
Unfortunately.
I erased all that.

2884
02:18:12,410 --> 02:18:13,770
Edwin caret.
Hold on when?

2885
02:18:14,120 --> 02:18:15,260
When correct.
Go back up.

2886
02:18:17,350 --> 02:18:20,030
That was in atlantic city.
Edwin credit is like a old,

2887
02:18:20,150 --> 02:18:22,340
old school as first loss.
Tough dude.

2888
02:18:22,341 --> 02:18:24,830
Yeah,
he lost a correct crit was a beast.

2889
02:18:25,520 --> 02:18:27,970
Micky Ward man.
Those fights with turo,

2890
02:18:28,020 --> 02:18:30,440
gadi.
Those are some of the all time,

2891
02:18:30,650 --> 02:18:31,483
most exciting and barbaric boxing 
matches ever when two dudes are just 

2892
02:18:34,851 --> 02:18:38,570
that close to each other like that close
skill wise,

2893
02:18:38,810 --> 02:18:41,570
like when they go out and just back and 
forth and back and forth.

2894
02:18:41,571 --> 02:18:44,300
And nobody quits that.
Those fights were insane.

2895
02:18:44,301 --> 02:18:44,730
Man.

2896
02:18:44,730 --> 02:18:45,530
My dad,
um,

2897
02:18:45,530 --> 02:18:46,820
he,
he loved boxing.

2898
02:18:46,840 --> 02:18:50,580
He's toured the glove box scene to watch
mexican boxing at the forum,

2899
02:18:51,180 --> 02:18:55,860
hastily able every tuesday nights they 
used to be these crazy mexican boxer,

2900
02:18:55,861 --> 02:18:57,480
but they were all featherweight 
lightweight.

2901
02:18:57,990 --> 02:19:02,670
There was a guy named rubin olivarez was
lightweight,

2902
02:19:03,180 --> 02:19:04,013
pepino cuevas,
and there's this guy who was cuban guy 

2903
02:19:08,221 --> 02:19:09,240
who will.
Awesome.

2904
02:19:09,241 --> 02:19:10,074
Mom.
I'm nepalis mckenna for less or less 

2905
02:19:14,470 --> 02:19:18,360
what's happening in Mexico.
He fought hearns,

2906
02:19:18,361 --> 02:19:20,280
right?
He hit him up.

2907
02:19:20,310 --> 02:19:21,061
Hey man,
fuck them up.

2908
02:19:21,061 --> 02:19:22,920
but that's true.
That is way too,

2909
02:19:22,921 --> 02:19:24,000
man.
Yeah.

2910
02:19:24,330 --> 02:19:26,030
My friend does boxing now at um,
uh,

2911
02:19:26,031 --> 02:19:28,190
with a bet with duran.
Does the box seat now

2912
02:19:28,190 --> 02:19:30,260
and um,
for a golden boy,

2913
02:19:30,800 --> 02:19:31,670
no shit.
Yeah,

2914
02:19:31,671 --> 02:19:35,210
they are boxing.
Do my friend announces a fights?

2915
02:19:35,300 --> 02:19:36,750
Oh,
because they have um,

2916
02:19:36,890 --> 02:19:37,723
they have boxing every once in a while 
in downtown la at some regular hotel at 

2917
02:19:41,301 --> 02:19:43,400
a club.
And they have like young boxers.

2918
02:19:44,290 --> 02:19:47,830
He says ring set.
And he commented a lot of young incoming

2919
02:19:47,870 --> 02:19:49,520
boxers.
No shit man.

2920
02:19:51,140 --> 02:19:53,650
Yeah man,
that's a,

2921
02:19:53,830 --> 02:19:57,290
that's a crazy gig.
So as he traveled around with tattoos,

2922
02:19:57,330 --> 02:19:59,100
he'd go into all these international,
local,

2923
02:19:59,360 --> 02:20:00,193
the local ones,
like he does local ones like it when 

2924
02:20:01,761 --> 02:20:02,594
they fight over there and stand up for 
spring casino or more wrong go those 

2925
02:20:05,031 --> 02:20:07,760
type of fights.
It was a good time right now for boxing.

2926
02:20:07,790 --> 02:20:08,601
Oh yeah.
Married.

2927
02:20:08,601 --> 02:20:11,060
Very exciting match ups.
a lot of people.

2928
02:20:11,120 --> 02:20:13,170
Canelo and triple g.
Whew.

2929
02:20:13,190 --> 02:20:15,190
I can't wait for that rematch.
Me too.

2930
02:20:16,080 --> 02:20:16,913
I'm performing the day before of where 
I'm going to be at the hard rock cafe 

2931
02:20:23,600 --> 02:20:24,850
the day before the fight.

2932
02:20:24,860 --> 02:20:27,260
I don't know.
Friday get there early people,

2933
02:20:27,261 --> 02:20:28,310

I'll meet you at the way in who?
That is going to be an intense fight.

2936
02:20:32,451 --> 02:20:34,070
Man.
That first fight was intense.

2937
02:20:34,130 --> 02:20:36,050
I thought triple g one.
I just hold.

2938
02:20:36,051 --> 02:20:40,160
Nothing happens between now and the 
fight will get injured.

2939
02:20:40,161 --> 02:20:41,900
Please don't get injured.
Nobody got injured.

2940
02:20:41,901 --> 02:20:44,250
Nobody tests positive.
Nobody hit nobody hitting a wall.

2941
02:20:45,200 --> 02:20:47,780
Nobody drive crazy.
Don't do anything stupid.

2942
02:20:47,810 --> 02:20:51,230
Jesus christ.
You're dealing with like you going to be

2943
02:20:51,231 --> 02:20:52,820
there right time.
Crushers.

2944
02:20:52,880 --> 02:20:56,950
What day is that?
I've been november or November 3rd.

2945
02:20:56,990 --> 02:20:58,610
I like watching shit at home,
man.

2946
02:20:58,630 --> 02:21:00,890
I want to go there.
Too many humans.

2947
02:21:01,370 --> 02:21:02,810
You know,
everyone's jammed in.

2948
02:21:02,811 --> 02:21:04,670
I have to do that so many times for the 
ufc.

2949
02:21:05,120 --> 02:21:06,890
You know when I'm not working for the 
ufc,

2950
02:21:06,891 --> 02:21:10,070
I like to be home watching you watch it 
with your friends or loan,

2951
02:21:10,110 --> 02:21:10,943
chili.

2952
02:21:10,970 --> 02:21:11,803
That bowl.
Sometimes I just want to watch it by 

2953
02:21:13,281 --> 02:21:14,114
myself,
but a lot of times the only time I'm 

2954
02:21:15,711 --> 02:21:17,850
watching fights by myself with ufc 
fight,

2955
02:21:17,880 --> 02:21:18,713
I'm not commenting.
It's because we don't have a fight 

2956
02:21:20,781 --> 02:21:22,100
companion,
you know?

2957
02:21:22,160 --> 02:21:24,380
Like if we're doing.
We do tHese fight companions.

2958
02:21:24,410 --> 02:21:25,243
Like if we're home,
it's like a home and shop and eddie 

2959
02:21:27,441 --> 02:21:28,274
bravo.
We're all home while the ufc is on the 

2960
02:21:30,681 --> 02:21:33,380
road somewhere.
We'll watch it in here and we'll play it

2961
02:21:33,381 --> 02:21:35,810
and we'll talk shit fights going on.
That's fun,

2962
02:21:35,811 --> 02:21:37,730
man.
It's the most fun thing of all time.

2963
02:21:37,790 --> 02:21:39,440
Of all time.
Eddie bravo.

2964
02:21:39,441 --> 02:21:40,274
So he's busting out some ridiculous 
conspiracies and crazy jujitsu talk and 

2965
02:21:43,931 --> 02:21:44,764
then it goes to music.
We might just start with talking about 

2966
02:21:46,281 --> 02:21:49,490
music for an entire fight and not even 
pay attention to the fight.

2967
02:21:49,730 --> 02:21:51,530
It's a.
It's a fun gig man.

2968
02:21:51,531 --> 02:21:53,420
It's like we're such good friends.

2969
02:21:53,420 --> 02:21:54,253
We've known each other for so long that 
when we get together is the one that 

2970
02:21:57,760 --> 02:21:59,660
really fun.
Shamrock the hold,

2971
02:21:59,661 --> 02:22:01,130
right?
No.

2972
02:22:01,131 --> 02:22:02,170
Gracie.
Gracie.

2973
02:22:02,190 --> 02:22:02,871
Yeah.
I'm sorry.

2974
02:22:02,871 --> 02:22:05,060
Yeah.
Right now I'm wearing his dad.

2975
02:22:05,810 --> 02:22:08,780
Respect helio gracie.
If it wasn't for this dude,

2976
02:22:08,810 --> 02:22:11,300
man.
He's one of the most important people in

2977
02:22:11,301 --> 02:22:15,120
the history of martial arts right here.
This gentlemen know that.

2978
02:22:15,130 --> 02:22:16,240
That family.
Ooh,

2979
02:22:16,530 --> 02:22:21,080
that's a crazy contributing family to 
the history of martial arts for sure.

2980
02:22:21,081 --> 02:22:24,170
The number one family in the history of 
jujitsu,

2981
02:22:24,400 --> 02:22:25,233
I mean by and arguably the number one 
family in the history of all martial 

2982
02:22:28,711 --> 02:22:29,730
arts.
I mean,

2983
02:22:29,731 --> 02:22:31,920
that's a debate that people will have to
the end of the time,

2984
02:22:31,921 --> 02:22:32,940
but that,
that is a,

2985
02:22:33,270 --> 02:22:34,103
it's a pretty strong candidate for the 
number one most influential family in 

2986
02:22:37,141 --> 02:22:39,570
the history of martial arts.
Whoa.

2987
02:22:40,390 --> 02:22:42,300
Hold on.
How did they get started with that?

2988
02:22:42,300 --> 02:22:44,120
Um,
I'll get you started telling me you want

2989
02:22:44,130 --> 02:22:46,170
to go.
You tell me when you tell me where.

2990
02:22:46,290 --> 02:22:47,123
I'll hook it up for you.
We'll figure out where you don't talk 

2991
02:22:49,561 --> 02:22:52,770
about where you live on the show because
people show up to training every once in

2992
02:22:52,771 --> 02:22:55,000
a while on the road show.
He trains like a motherfucker.

2993
02:22:55,020 --> 02:22:55,590
Dude,
joe,

2994
02:22:55,590 --> 02:22:57,020
he trains all the time.
It give me three,

2995
02:22:57,030 --> 02:22:57,863
four days a week.
He just got his blue bell blue bell 

2996
02:22:59,980 --> 02:23:00,690
cocks.
Not glocks.

2997
02:23:00,690 --> 02:23:02,880
Legit.
And here's,

2998
02:23:02,881 --> 02:23:05,280
you have to realize joey diaz gets on 
top of you.

2999
02:23:05,281 --> 02:23:06,870
You're not getting up.
Okay?

3000
02:23:07,340 --> 02:23:10,770
Except tHat he's strong.
Man is not just heavy.

3001
02:23:10,771 --> 02:23:15,300
He's a strong guy.
It has mad like booking catcher's mitts.

3002
02:23:15,810 --> 02:23:18,150
He's a gorilla.
He's a big old gorilla.

3003
02:23:18,210 --> 02:23:21,390
When when I met joey,
joey was only like 220 pounds.

3004
02:23:21,420 --> 02:23:24,720
He was a football player.
There's an old school photo of him.

3005
02:23:25,200 --> 02:23:29,340
I met him in like somewhere in the late 
nineties.

3006
02:23:29,400 --> 02:23:32,660
He was like [inaudible],
just like a login enforcer,

3007
02:23:32,720 --> 02:23:34,830
like a big british guy,
you know,

3008
02:23:35,100 --> 02:23:37,050
he wasn't,
he didn't get that fat at all.

3009
02:23:37,320 --> 02:23:40,320
But when he got that fat was also,
when he got that funny,

3010
02:23:40,580 --> 02:23:41,413
it was crazy.
Like he just didn't give a fuck anymore 

3011
02:23:43,500 --> 02:23:44,820
with anything,
with food,

3012
02:23:44,850 --> 02:23:48,120
with anything partying.
It became just a monster.

3013
02:23:48,330 --> 02:23:49,163
Could so funny.
I remember the first time I saw him 

3014
02:23:51,100 --> 02:23:53,160
without the laugh factory.
It was late nineties.

3015
02:23:53,850 --> 02:23:58,850
Big dude cuban who I know and yet he had
the crazy man just joined karate karate

3016
02:24:02,320 --> 02:24:07,320
to revise that is for sure.
For sure.

3017
02:24:10,840 --> 02:24:12,550
My all time favorite character.

3018
02:24:13,280 --> 02:24:16,710
He had this and they had um,
a member of the dumpster.

3019
02:24:18,300 --> 02:24:21,410
Jelly karate though is the best karate 
today.

3020
02:24:21,411 --> 02:24:23,930
You understand me here for the ufc 
minute.

3021
02:24:24,420 --> 02:24:28,000
A lot of people see me in a medical 
marijuana reports while people see me in

3022
02:24:28,001 --> 02:24:30,380
the sports reports,
but nobody really knows.

3023
02:24:30,530 --> 02:24:33,750
I'm a trained fucking assassin of cuban 
black belt.

3024
02:24:34,460 --> 02:24:35,293
I lost my rank on the fucking boat ride 
over green gumballs in China with 

3025
02:24:44,560 --> 02:24:46,650
shanghai Hong Kong,
Bolivia.

3026
02:24:47,240 --> 02:24:48,073
That's who I trained with fucking 
savages that these little fucking guys 

3027
02:24:50,781 --> 02:24:51,614
flying through the air.
But you're lucky you caught me because 

3028
02:24:54,110 --> 02:24:54,943
joy karate's and they give you a lock 
for ufc and it's all about fucking 

3029
02:24:57,681 --> 02:24:58,311

3031

My man picks it isn't a fuck people up

3032
02:25:03,291 --> 02:25:04,700
You understand me?
He went through.

3033
02:25:05,780 --> 02:25:08,030
He went through forest whitaker,
forest griffin.

3034
02:25:10,440 --> 02:25:11,860
this motherfucker,
first off,

3035
02:25:13,360 --> 02:25:14,540
that's a moon pie.
Shit.

3036
02:25:14,630 --> 02:25:18,470
You understand,
but not really a restaurant.

3037
02:25:18,471 --> 02:25:19,304
I'm fucking guy with a couple of needs 
to the fucking head up on a psychic you 

3038
02:25:24,850 --> 02:25:28,500
gentlemen to some fucking samurai or 
some arm bar.

3039
02:25:30,400 --> 02:25:33,160
Choke them up.
It's that simple.

3040
02:25:33,800 --> 02:25:34,633
That's anderson silver.
You understand what any of those 

3041
02:25:35,531 --> 02:25:40,531
traditional baby.
Don't forget ufc.

3042
02:25:41,710 --> 02:25:42,543
Catch me next week what?

3044
02:25:47,050 --> 02:25:49,940
through the air.
Thank you.

3045
02:25:52,120 --> 02:25:52,980
Perfect music

3046
02:25:53,010 --> 02:25:54,640
to whoever did the music.
Nailed it.

3047
02:25:54,660 --> 02:25:57,400
That's a little way from now.
From then to now.

3048
02:25:57,490 --> 02:25:59,490
Oh yeah man.
A lot of weight.

3049
02:25:59,520 --> 02:26:00,353
He's a.
Is he a spokesperson for weight 

3050
02:26:02,211 --> 02:26:02,731
watchers?
Is.

3051
02:26:02,731 --> 02:26:05,610
THat's what he's doing.
Is he really think he is?

3052
02:26:05,611 --> 02:26:07,830
I think he's doing something for 
weightwatchers.

3053
02:26:07,920 --> 02:26:08,760
Julia.
Yeah.

3054
02:26:08,761 --> 02:26:10,760
Joey is he.
He likes weightwatchers.

3055
02:26:10,770 --> 02:26:11,603
He,
that's how he lost all his weight when 

3056
02:26:12,121 --> 02:26:14,840
you lost the first time.
and then he's losing it this time.

3057
02:26:14,841 --> 02:26:16,610
It's used in that way too.
he said they,

3058
02:26:16,710 --> 02:26:17,760
they're catching up,
man.

3059
02:26:17,790 --> 02:26:19,530
They've got good science behind their 
food.

3060
02:26:19,620 --> 02:26:20,453
But even they do.
They say you could have as many eggs as 

3061
02:26:22,921 --> 02:26:24,330
you want.
You can have eggs.

3062
02:26:25,230 --> 02:26:26,220
Eggs are bad for you,
bro.

3063
02:26:26,310 --> 02:26:27,450
Choice.
So funny memory.

3064
02:26:27,570 --> 02:26:30,320
When he came here to the one bit about,
um,

3065
02:26:30,930 --> 02:26:31,763
he said,
I went to a do a show at the one in the 

3066
02:26:34,291 --> 02:26:35,124
hotel,
had a bed you put a quarter in and a 

3067
02:26:36,990 --> 02:26:39,170
finger comes up,
pulls in a frequent called joe.

3068
02:26:39,171 --> 02:26:40,004
So it goes in your ass.
I went through last week was let's do a 

3069
02:26:42,811 --> 02:26:44,970
show two years ago.
The whole place is run down,

3070
02:26:44,971 --> 02:26:45,960
man.
The machine's broken.

3071
02:26:45,961 --> 02:26:47,130
You got to put your finger.

3072
02:26:52,680 --> 02:26:53,513
He was in the house.
How long have you been doing stand up 

3073
02:26:55,661 --> 02:26:57,040
now?
Twenty years.

3074
02:26:57,100 --> 02:27:00,910
I started in 1996.
Late 95.

3075
02:27:01,660 --> 02:27:06,520
I prefer natural cafe and on melrose?
No,

3076
02:27:06,521 --> 02:27:07,011
on.
Yeah.

3077
02:27:07,011 --> 02:27:08,740
Melrose.
You one last comic standing.

3078
02:27:10,380 --> 02:27:12,520
One last comic standing.
How many people?

3079
02:27:12,521 --> 02:27:13,550
One that how many?
Uh,

3080
02:27:13,560 --> 02:27:16,080
how many different seasons they have 
that I want to see them?

3081
02:27:16,090 --> 02:27:19,140
Seven and 10 now.
You know,

3082
02:27:19,170 --> 02:27:19,750
was fun.
Joe,

3083
02:27:19,750 --> 02:27:20,583
when I won my son's mom filed for child 
support the next day and she just took 

3084
02:27:26,080 --> 02:27:26,913
half.
She became the last baby mama standing 

3085
02:27:30,490 --> 02:27:35,490
straight up dog bucket bitch that you 
took the class.

3086
02:27:35,561 --> 02:27:37,870
I had kids with no one other than high 
school.

3087
02:27:38,380 --> 02:27:41,890
And then there a penal child support in.
Oh well I could see your point.

3088
02:27:42,610 --> 02:27:43,690
We broke even,
you know.

3089
02:27:43,840 --> 02:27:45,610
Yeah.
You definitely owed some money though,

3090
02:27:45,611 --> 02:27:46,444
right?
Yeah.

3091
02:27:49,270 --> 02:27:50,260
No,
it's crazy.

3092
02:27:50,870 --> 02:27:51,590
When,
um,

3093
02:27:51,590 --> 02:27:52,423
when we were on last comic standing,
they do like a background check of 

3094
02:27:55,241 --> 02:27:56,480
everybody.
Yeah.

3095
02:27:56,710 --> 02:28:00,580
And I noticed like some people were 
slowly disappearing,

3096
02:28:00,581 --> 02:28:01,414
you know,
from the last comic standing because 

3097
02:28:02,580 --> 02:28:06,820
that background check criminal records.
Some people were taken out of the photo,

3098
02:28:06,821 --> 02:28:10,030
like they were put in positions.
But you will take the photos.

3099
02:28:10,300 --> 02:28:13,980
My brother,
he committed a lot of crimes and he,

3100
02:28:13,981 --> 02:28:14,490
he,
um,

3101
02:28:14,490 --> 02:28:17,050
I didn't know it then he stole my 
identity.

3102
02:28:17,830 --> 02:28:18,663
Oh no,
it was nbc investigated a couple notes 

3103
02:28:20,680 --> 02:28:21,513
here man.
I see two files on your own to open 

3104
02:28:24,531 --> 02:28:25,364
cases on you.
One of them for possessions of crack 

3105
02:28:28,311 --> 02:28:30,410
cocaine,
possession of sale,

3106
02:28:30,560 --> 02:28:33,810
fader to go to court.
This is your brother's also gay noise.

3107
02:28:33,820 --> 02:28:35,630
Have another brother who's not gay.
He's a,

3108
02:28:35,690 --> 02:28:37,540
he's a criminal.
He's the one that came.

3109
02:28:37,850 --> 02:28:40,340
That was one that keeps coming out of 
prison or worse.

3110
02:28:40,790 --> 02:28:41,510
Oh,
that one.

3111
02:28:41,510 --> 02:28:42,343
So,
okay.

3112
02:28:42,950 --> 02:28:45,200
My brother,
he liked the ultimate criminal.

3113
02:28:45,201 --> 02:28:46,690
He's not on facebook.
He's not on.

3114
02:28:46,691 --> 02:28:49,430
No social media.
You can't find him anywhere.

3115
02:28:49,610 --> 02:28:50,443
There's no photo anywhere.
So I had to track down his daughter on 

3116
02:28:54,141 --> 02:28:55,550
facebook and said,
man,

3117
02:28:55,551 --> 02:28:59,030
is there a picture of you and your dad 
somewhere?

3118
02:28:59,390 --> 02:29:00,223
ANd she sends me the photo of my brother
and then they do the comparisons of me 

3119
02:29:03,441 --> 02:29:06,770
and him and they let me go.
That's hilarious.

3120
02:29:07,130 --> 02:29:07,963
That is hilarious.
They have photos of him like committing 

3121
02:29:09,741 --> 02:29:10,920
crimes.
Like yesterday,

3122
02:29:10,960 --> 02:29:11,793
camera photo,
hearing court when everybody got 

3123
02:29:13,671 --> 02:29:18,671
arrested for leap as far as uh,
my brother knows my birth certificate.

3124
02:29:19,410 --> 02:29:21,290
He know my birthday and he knows my 
name.

3125
02:29:21,830 --> 02:29:26,830
So what an asshole shit,
bro.

3126
02:29:27,560 --> 02:29:29,840
My other brother,
the gay one,

3127
02:29:31,740 --> 02:29:33,880
your own brother out and shit.
And my,

3128
02:29:34,220 --> 02:29:35,900
my other brother,
the gay one,

3129
02:29:36,170 --> 02:29:37,003
he got pulled over for a traffic 
violation and saves your name to my 

3130
02:29:40,161 --> 02:29:40,370
brother.

3131
02:29:40,370 --> 02:29:42,370
My brother used his name and my brother 
was,

3132
02:29:42,470 --> 02:29:43,710
was um,
they,

3133
02:29:43,810 --> 02:29:47,590
they put him in a prison in Arizona for 
illegal immigrants also.

3134
02:29:47,650 --> 02:29:49,400
Your brother use both of your.
Yes.

3135
02:29:49,700 --> 02:29:51,290
Oh my god.
So my brother,

3136
02:29:51,680 --> 02:29:52,513
my gay brother fernando was on his way 
to prison in Arizona for a crime he 

3137
02:29:56,151 --> 02:29:57,890
didn't commit.
Oh no.

3138
02:29:57,980 --> 02:29:59,750
Luckily for him,
when he was locked up,

3139
02:30:00,110 --> 02:30:03,300
a guy that was with me in rehab knew me 
and he,

3140
02:30:03,320 --> 02:30:03,850
he,
he,

3141
02:30:03,850 --> 02:30:04,520
he,
um,

3142
02:30:04,520 --> 02:30:05,353
my brother and him were friends and he 
and my brothers back in prison a few 

3143
02:30:09,710 --> 02:30:10,543
days.
Can you imagine going to jail because 

3144
02:30:11,901 --> 02:30:15,260
your brother's a piece of shit and he 
used your name to commit crimes.

3145
02:30:15,380 --> 02:30:16,213
How fucking mad you stole my identity in
prison knowing that this motherfucker 

3146
02:30:21,081 --> 02:30:25,070
risky or your freedom just so that he 
could get out.

3147
02:30:25,220 --> 02:30:26,210
He's like,
fuck cam,

3148
02:30:26,620 --> 02:30:27,920
cam.
you don't call me anymore.

3149
02:30:27,920 --> 02:30:31,160
I'm fucking social security number.
I know his name.

3150
02:30:31,161 --> 02:30:32,990
I know his birthdate.
I know her heart,

3151
02:30:33,050 --> 02:30:34,230
her heart.
I'll here.

3152
02:30:34,340 --> 02:30:36,560
That's so crazy.
What a psycho.

3153
02:30:37,760 --> 02:30:40,370
Damn man.
You can't pick your family problem.

3154
02:30:41,050 --> 02:30:42,470
Problem for some folks,
right?

3155
02:30:42,530 --> 02:30:45,530
You can't pick your family man.
Like anybody who thinks that there's a,

3156
02:30:45,680 --> 02:30:47,450
hey,
you fucking get what you deserve in this

3157
02:30:47,451 --> 02:30:48,800
world.
Bullshit.

3158
02:30:49,130 --> 02:30:51,920
Little babies are born in a fucked up 
families.

3159
02:30:52,250 --> 02:30:53,083
You know,
sometimes your brother is a piece of 

3160
02:30:54,591 --> 02:30:55,424
shit.
He's a piece of shit before you're even 

3161
02:30:56,691 --> 02:30:57,980
born.
You didn't even know.

3162
02:30:58,010 --> 02:30:58,843
And you're born Later and he's just 
ready to dominate you and be a fucking 

3163
02:31:02,301 --> 02:31:03,350
asshole to you.
And you're like,

3164
02:31:03,351 --> 02:31:04,700
what?
You know?

3165
02:31:04,701 --> 02:31:06,990
That's what happened with gangs.
Con games.

3166
02:31:07,080 --> 02:31:10,280
Con became games con like later in his 
life.

3167
02:31:10,281 --> 02:31:11,114
But when he was younger,
he killed his brother because his 

3168
02:31:13,371 --> 02:31:15,770
brother was stealing fish.
They would go fishing,

3169
02:31:15,800 --> 02:31:17,090
his brother would take his fish.
He was like,

3170
02:31:17,091 --> 02:31:17,924
oh,
for real.

3171
02:31:18,080 --> 02:31:20,160
So he got with his other brother

3172
02:31:20,340 --> 02:31:21,173
and they fucking ambushed their older 
brother and killed him with a bow and 

3173
02:31:23,911 --> 02:31:26,220
arrow killed his brother.
What did dad say?

3174
02:31:26,460 --> 02:31:29,940
Mom was really pissed.
Shouldn't let dad's deal.

3175
02:31:29,941 --> 02:31:32,010
He shouldn't have let a my brother steal
my fish.

3176
02:31:32,070 --> 02:31:37,070
Fucking lock key parents latch key.
What does it?

3177
02:31:37,800 --> 02:31:42,150
Let's imagine that I'm in killing your 
brother with a bow and arrow.

3178
02:31:43,100 --> 02:31:45,500
life was cheap back then or choking him 
to death.

3179
02:31:46,930 --> 02:31:47,770
Jesus christ

3180
02:31:49,890 --> 02:31:53,730
or choking him to death because the mob 
or whatever you're associated with,

3181
02:31:53,731 --> 02:31:54,564
your brother got to go.
So you don't know where your brother is 

3182
02:31:56,191 --> 02:31:58,110
now?
My brother probably is somewhere running

3183
02:31:58,111 --> 02:32:01,370
around in Mexico.
Living in tj?

3184
02:32:02,580 --> 02:32:05,520
Yeah.
does he ever come back?

3185
02:32:05,640 --> 02:32:06,121
No,
no,

3186
02:32:06,121 --> 02:32:07,280
no,
he lived in lower there.

3187
02:32:07,290 --> 02:32:07,800
Um,
he,

3188
02:32:07,800 --> 02:32:11,310
he works at some pick apart area over 
there.

3189
02:32:11,820 --> 02:32:13,340
Pick apart.
He had like a pickup part.

3190
02:32:13,350 --> 02:32:16,990
You go there for parts for your car.
Stolen car park.

3191
02:32:17,010 --> 02:32:17,880
No,
it's illegal.

3192
02:32:17,930 --> 02:32:19,590
But you go in there.
He told my brother,

3193
02:32:19,650 --> 02:32:21,840
I'm looking for a,
for a door for us.

3194
02:32:21,841 --> 02:32:23,790
Seventy nine toyota and my brother go,
yeah,

3195
02:32:23,791 --> 02:32:26,330
you're going to go over there.
Junkyards junkyard.

3196
02:32:26,390 --> 02:32:27,680
Yeah.
Yeah,

3197
02:32:27,710 --> 02:32:29,730
man.
I know dudes who built cars.

3198
02:32:29,760 --> 02:32:31,500
They would,
they would go to junk yards.

3199
02:32:31,501 --> 02:32:31,861
Like,
ah,

3200
02:32:31,861 --> 02:32:32,694
I gotta get this fender are going to get
a good fan of her [inaudible] 70 

3201
02:32:34,531 --> 02:32:35,364
chevelle.

3202
02:32:35,410 --> 02:32:37,530
I go and look.
And that's kind of fun.

3203
02:32:38,130 --> 02:32:40,170
You know,
if I had 100 lives,

3204
02:32:41,070 --> 02:32:41,903
one of the things I do is build cars.
I think that'd be the coolest shit in 

3205
02:32:44,161 --> 02:32:45,030
the world.
You know,

3206
02:32:45,110 --> 02:32:48,000
I envy the fuck out of people who have 
done that or have the time.

3207
02:32:48,120 --> 02:32:49,440
Yeah,
that's the thing is at the time.

3208
02:32:49,770 --> 02:32:50,603
But people who have learned how to do it
and get a frame and figure out how to 

3209
02:32:54,361 --> 02:32:55,194
get the frame all sandblasted and powder
coated and then figuring out how to put 

3210
02:32:59,671 --> 02:33:00,504
the suspension on and fenders and to 
really take a car apart and restore it 

3211
02:33:05,280 --> 02:33:07,030
and restore it and have it looked 
beautiful.

3212
02:33:07,060 --> 02:33:09,690
Then drive around in it.
You see those guys that do that and go,

3213
02:33:09,691 --> 02:33:12,690
wow,
that's an admirable quality.

3214
02:33:12,691 --> 02:33:15,360
There's like,
that's like something very few men,

3215
02:33:15,930 --> 02:33:17,870
whatever do.
But every man admires him,

3216
02:33:17,871 --> 02:33:18,600
man,
and could do it.

3217
02:33:18,600 --> 02:33:19,260
Like,
oh,

3218
02:33:19,260 --> 02:33:22,700
me and my brother,
we restored this 1969 camaro.

3219
02:33:22,770 --> 02:33:25,500
I remember I read that matt hughes did 
that.

3220
02:33:25,560 --> 02:33:26,393
Matt hughes,
who was also at the tIme ufc 

3221
02:33:28,081 --> 02:33:32,940
welterweight world champion also 
restored classic cars.

3222
02:33:34,230 --> 02:33:37,560
That's a man.
That's a fucking man.

3223
02:33:37,860 --> 02:33:38,693
Like if you take it,
you could rebuild a car and then get it 

3224
02:33:42,181 --> 02:33:46,740
to the point where you did that.
That's a.

3225
02:33:46,741 --> 02:33:49,620
That's a manly activity right there to 
life.

3226
02:33:50,210 --> 02:33:53,100
that's one of the most manly things you 
can do.

3227
02:33:53,460 --> 02:33:55,950
Rebuild a car.
Guys would work on their own cars.

3228
02:33:55,980 --> 02:33:58,980
That's a rare breed son.
My that always worked on his car,

3229
02:33:58,981 --> 02:34:00,300
man.
He never went to the mechanic.

3230
02:34:00,570 --> 02:34:01,920
Yeah,
he will go out.

3231
02:34:01,990 --> 02:34:06,840
He'd be up there like changing the spark
plugs out of the 73 impala by himself in

3232
02:34:06,841 --> 02:34:07,674
the rain

3233
02:34:08,160 --> 02:34:08,993
dude,

3234
02:34:10,140 --> 02:34:12,870
changing them to.
He be out there In the parking lot,

3235
02:34:12,871 --> 02:34:16,290
man.
Like all over like team his own stuff to

3236
02:34:16,291 --> 02:34:17,830
take the motor out of the car

3237
02:34:18,220 --> 02:34:21,310
and put a new motor in and put it all in
different kinds of man.

3238
02:34:21,460 --> 02:34:23,780
And I'm in like in my,
like elaine,

3239
02:34:23,810 --> 02:34:26,730

flipper career.

3240
02:34:26,750 --> 02:34:28,080
Help me out.
My dad,

3241
02:34:28,090 --> 02:34:28,923
they want to know help.
the first time I tried to help you know 

3242
02:34:30,821 --> 02:34:33,220

Go peel your fucking toys.

3243
02:34:33,221 --> 02:34:35,540
You just pet me the wrong ranch hassle.
Oh,

3244
02:34:36,100 --> 02:34:39,460
judgmental daddy thing is to like date.
They get locked into that.

3245
02:34:39,461 --> 02:34:40,294
They don't want you to distract them.
That's the word they're escaping 

3246
02:34:42,610 --> 02:34:46,840
escaping by working on this car and 
wrenching things down.

3247
02:34:46,841 --> 02:34:48,470
Change,
carburetors and shit.

3248
02:34:48,471 --> 02:34:53,471
And those guys who could do that.
That's a special type of guy.

3249
02:34:55,160 --> 02:34:57,530
There's like this,
a special mechanic man,

3250
02:34:57,590 --> 02:34:58,100
like,
you know,

3251
02:34:58,100 --> 02:34:59,000
um,
you know,

3252
02:34:59,010 --> 02:34:59,843
a guy could do it because we're,
when you invite those guys to get 

3253
02:35:03,041 --> 02:35:04,160
together.
Yeah,

3254
02:35:04,360 --> 02:35:05,290
they always look dirty.

3255
02:35:05,670 --> 02:35:07,170
He clean.
Like,

3256
02:35:07,180 --> 02:35:08,590
even even if you bring your,
your,

3257
02:35:08,591 --> 02:35:09,424
your invite,
you're cool mechanic for the 

3258
02:35:10,331 --> 02:35:12,880
neighborhood to a party and you're 
wearing a tux,

3259
02:35:13,090 --> 02:35:13,960
you'd be like,
damn,

3260
02:35:13,990 --> 02:35:15,670
there goes joel.
He still looked dirty.

3261
02:35:15,850 --> 02:35:16,683
Oh,
he's got crazy fingernail dirt grease 

3262
02:35:19,421 --> 02:35:21,130
under their fingernails.
It just never comes out.

3263
02:35:21,180 --> 02:35:23,440
You don't recognize him standing up.
Hey,

3264
02:35:23,441 --> 02:35:25,570
here's a question.
How many,

3265
02:35:28,390 --> 02:35:31,870
how many people get sick from working in
gas stations?

3266
02:35:32,260 --> 02:35:34,510
I would think that like working in a gas
station,

3267
02:35:34,511 --> 02:35:36,630
all those fumes,
like,

3268
02:35:36,640 --> 02:35:37,473
that shit's got to be terrible for you.
Fumes and then all the grease and oil 

3269
02:35:41,741 --> 02:35:44,860
and smashing your fingers and stuff.
Oh,

3270
02:35:44,861 --> 02:35:45,694
that's the worst.
Whereas guys are always smashing their 

3271
02:35:47,711 --> 02:35:49,930
fingers and losing tips.
Taping them.

3272
02:35:50,620 --> 02:35:53,350
Fuck man.
They know the kid.

3273
02:35:53,920 --> 02:35:55,600
They used to be a guy that used to fix,
you know,

3274
02:35:55,690 --> 02:35:59,050
the toys of guy that in the neighborhood
that don't have to fix everybody's car.

3275
02:35:59,110 --> 02:35:59,611
Right,
right,

3276
02:35:59,611 --> 02:36:00,444
right.
And it was a guy named eli and they'll 

3277
02:36:03,181 --> 02:36:04,340
come with,
they were a big family.

3278
02:36:04,460 --> 02:36:06,790
There were like nine or 10 people in 
their family,

3279
02:36:07,660 --> 02:36:11,320
but this guy will fix your car.
But he also likes to party,

3280
02:36:12,900 --> 02:36:14,820
like party hard joe,
like,

3281
02:36:15,320 --> 02:36:16,400
like.
But he was the star,

3282
02:36:16,510 --> 02:36:19,410
but he was a volkswagen genius.
Oh,

3283
02:36:20,380 --> 02:36:23,020
bugs.
Bugs were his thing.

3284
02:36:23,021 --> 02:36:27,630
But he also was a main drug addict.
This is my friend juni.

3285
02:36:27,970 --> 02:36:30,340
He was getting his bug fixed from him.
He had a rag.

3286
02:36:30,370 --> 02:36:34,300
Top was the oval bag with beautiful bug.
This guy,

3287
02:36:34,301 --> 02:36:37,290
eli man smoked pcp.
Oh no.

3288
02:36:37,370 --> 02:36:38,203
He just holding him,
holding the wrenches and staring at the 

3289
02:36:41,141 --> 02:36:43,420
bug for like three hours straight.
Not doing shit.

3290
02:36:43,600 --> 02:36:45,840
Wow.
Volkswagen.

3291
02:36:45,880 --> 02:36:47,140
A different kind of car,
man.

3292
02:36:47,710 --> 02:36:49,240
I could bug you.
Drive a bug.

3293
02:36:49,270 --> 02:36:51,700
that's a different kind of human.
You got to be a bug.

3294
02:36:51,701 --> 02:36:54,340
Guys would know how to fix a bug.
My friend jimmy,

3295
02:36:54,341 --> 02:36:55,174
that same friend that I went to,
the boxing match to see mickey word 

3296
02:36:57,761 --> 02:36:59,350
fight.
He also had a bug hit,

3297
02:36:59,351 --> 02:37:02,800
a blue bug.
It was the most ridiculous car.

3298
02:37:02,890 --> 02:37:06,760
I remember being in it like we were 
laughing how silly it was because it was

3299
02:37:06,761 --> 02:37:07,750
so,
uh,

3300
02:37:07,940 --> 02:37:08,860
he love cars,
right?

3301
02:37:08,920 --> 02:37:09,431
Oh,
love.

3302
02:37:09,431 --> 02:37:11,800
Cause I remember,
I remember,

3303
02:37:11,801 --> 02:37:12,634
um,
you and eddie griffin in the same car 

3304
02:37:14,450 --> 02:37:15,960
and his was dead.
two years

3305
02:37:15,980 --> 02:37:19,490
was clean.
Well his arms was cool man.

3306
02:37:19,510 --> 02:37:21,380
You will come into a man like the 
fucking,

3307
02:37:21,680 --> 02:37:24,560
like the cleaner in shit like harvey chi
town.

3308
02:37:25,620 --> 02:37:27,070
And I was like,
you know what I mean,

3309
02:37:27,090 --> 02:37:29,990
she gave me one of those,
what they cars are fast dude.

3310
02:37:30,370 --> 02:37:32,660
It wasn't the fastest car.
She looked cool.

3311
02:37:32,720 --> 02:37:35,030
Well here's the thing about those cars,
man.

3312
02:37:35,031 --> 02:37:35,864
They were really well balanced.
Like it was a good amount of power for 

3313
02:37:39,141 --> 02:37:41,180
the size of it.
It was a very light car.

3314
02:37:41,830 --> 02:37:46,100
Like I want to say like the acura nsx 
wasn't even 3000 pounds.

3315
02:37:46,410 --> 02:37:48,050
That Was it.
I had a silver one.

3316
02:37:48,980 --> 02:37:50,690
Ferrari.
Somebody bought mine,

3317
02:37:50,870 --> 02:37:51,703
you don't know at two silver,
one with the wolf had a silver one in 

3318
02:37:55,731 --> 02:37:56,564
like the late nineties.
And then I had a silver one and the 

3319
02:37:59,331 --> 02:38:01,370
early two thousands.
That's my.

3320
02:38:01,420 --> 02:38:03,080
That's it right there.
That was my car.

3321
02:38:03,230 --> 02:38:05,450
That's It right there,
so somebody owns it.

3322
02:38:05,930 --> 02:38:10,400
Somebody bought it because I think I 
traded it in when I got something else,

3323
02:38:10,640 --> 02:38:14,330
but it was a joe rogan.
Thanks for modeling it to perfection.

3324
02:38:14,780 --> 02:38:17,180
That guy's got it.
That's my car to this day.

3325
02:38:17,181 --> 02:38:18,480
That was one of my all time favorite 
cars.

3326
02:38:18,500 --> 02:38:20,630
Definitely not the fastest car ever 
drove,

3327
02:38:20,690 --> 02:38:21,523
but it wasn't about being fast.
It was about like the experience of 

3328
02:38:26,181 --> 02:38:28,190
driving.
It was More real.

3329
02:38:28,191 --> 02:38:29,024
Tactile.
It's a very light car and it's a mid 

3330
02:38:30,891 --> 02:38:35,090
engine car seats with low right bucket 
sEats and it's a japanese car.

3331
02:38:35,120 --> 02:38:37,760
It's a honda so you know it's never 
going to break.

3332
02:38:38,090 --> 02:38:41,090
I never had a problem with those.
Like I had two of them.

3333
02:38:41,150 --> 02:38:41,983
I had one,
I had it for like three years when I 

3334
02:38:42,861 --> 02:38:45,020
traded it in and then I got this other 
one later,

3335
02:38:45,110 --> 02:38:48,260
but in between I had a porsche and that 
shit broke down constantly.

3336
02:38:48,740 --> 02:38:50,930
I had a 99,
19 or nine,

3337
02:38:50,931 --> 02:38:51,980
nine,
six turbo,

3338
02:38:51,981 --> 02:38:56,570
which is like two thouSand two.
That shit broke constantly.

3339
02:38:57,020 --> 02:38:59,570
It just kept breaking man.
All kinds of crazy shit.

3340
02:38:59,571 --> 02:39:00,710
Like the shift,
linkage blue,

3341
02:39:00,711 --> 02:39:01,544
two separate times where I would go to 
shift gears and it just disengaged and 

3342
02:39:05,421 --> 02:39:08,990
was floating around on two separate 
occasions that happened where I couldn't

3343
02:39:08,991 --> 02:39:09,824
shift gears and I was stuck one time.
Luckily it happened while I was driving 

3344
02:39:12,471 --> 02:39:13,304
down the road,
so it was driving down the road and it 

3345
02:39:14,631 --> 02:39:16,910
popped loose and I was in second gear.
I said,

3346
02:39:16,911 --> 02:39:18,800
okay,
I'm going to wind this bitch out and get

3347
02:39:18,801 --> 02:39:21,430
to the porsche dealership.
So I kept in second gear,

3348
02:39:21,480 --> 02:39:24,500
just drove around and second gear 
through the streets,

3349
02:39:24,501 --> 02:39:27,140
like near ventura.
Ridiculous.

3350
02:39:27,470 --> 02:39:29,890
They just weren't,
they weren't durable bathroom.

3351
02:39:29,940 --> 02:39:31,400
That porch.
That's the new one.

3352
02:39:31,401 --> 02:39:33,980
So no,
I wasn't.

3353
02:39:34,040 --> 02:39:35,720
I wasn't really into driving fast.

3354
02:39:35,720 --> 02:39:38,150
What I'm,
what I like is a car that corners really

3355
02:39:38,151 --> 02:39:39,250
well,
you know,

3356
02:39:39,260 --> 02:39:42,530
I like a car like that.
Just it has a connection to the road,

3357
02:39:42,740 --> 02:39:43,910
dude.
Look at that thing.

3358
02:39:44,030 --> 02:39:46,760
That's the new nsx.
That shit looks preposterous.

3359
02:39:47,540 --> 02:39:51,380
That's a preposterous looking vehicle 
like knight rider.

3360
02:39:51,500 --> 02:39:51,801
yeah.
With.

3361
02:39:51,801 --> 02:39:55,070
The only problem I have with this car is
the problem I have with all these cars,

3362
02:39:55,071 --> 02:39:56,200
they won't let you,
uh,

3363
02:39:56,450 --> 02:39:57,283
use a manual transmission.
They don't sell them with a manual 

3364
02:39:59,361 --> 02:40:02,120
transmission.
The problem with that is,

3365
02:40:02,360 --> 02:40:04,680
come on man,
we're not racing like I want.

3366
02:40:04,690 --> 02:40:08,750
I want it to feel good.
Like if it feels people need to remember

3367
02:40:08,751 --> 02:40:11,690
how much better it feels to drive a 
manual transmission.

3368
02:40:11,691 --> 02:40:15,320
everybody wants to not learn.
And since a lot of people don't know,

3369
02:40:15,321 --> 02:40:18,480
I never learned that's the problem 
because they don't want to stall out and

3370
02:40:18,481 --> 02:40:19,140
look like an asshole.

3371
02:40:19,140 --> 02:40:21,610
That's too much work.
Once you learn how to Drive,

3372
02:40:21,630 --> 02:40:23,430
he's still stalled out.
I stall out occasionally.

3373
02:40:23,640 --> 02:40:24,473
But the fund that you have with a car 
like that with a manual transmission is 

3374
02:40:28,471 --> 02:40:30,450
so different.
So you're engaged,

3375
02:40:30,451 --> 02:40:34,320
you're shifting things first.
Man,

3376
02:40:35,520 --> 02:40:38,160
there's something cool about that.
And for whatever reason,

3377
02:40:38,161 --> 02:40:41,040
people are forgetting that it's a 
totally different experience.

3378
02:40:41,280 --> 02:40:42,113
when you drive a car that has a manual 
transmission versus a car that's not a 

3379
02:40:44,780 --> 02:40:45,930
magnet.
more control,

3380
02:40:45,931 --> 02:40:46,764
right?
Well,

3381
02:40:46,780 --> 02:40:48,420
not really.
Honestly,

3382
02:40:48,720 --> 02:40:52,560
you're better off with the automatic if 
you want to be totally honest.

3383
02:40:52,770 --> 02:40:53,603
The automatic is going to go faster.
It's going to have a better choice of 

3384
02:40:56,431 --> 02:40:57,264
gear selection than you are.
It's going to like like a lot of times 

3385
02:40:59,671 --> 02:41:02,230
when these race car drivers to take like
an automatic porsche,

3386
02:41:02,260 --> 02:41:04,440
like one of the new ones,
they take it on track.

3387
02:41:04,800 --> 02:41:06,660
They don't even take it out of 
automatic.

3388
02:41:06,690 --> 02:41:09,360
They don't shift the gears themselves.
If it's a double clutch gearbox,

3389
02:41:09,361 --> 02:41:10,194
they put it in drive and they just go 
because things are so good at picking 

3390
02:41:13,201 --> 02:41:14,940
the right gear.
Why fuck around,

3391
02:41:15,420 --> 02:41:17,850
so it's better that way really is 
better.

3392
02:41:17,910 --> 02:41:19,680
You have more control of the car that 
way,

3393
02:41:20,190 --> 02:41:21,023
but that's not necessarily what makes it
the most fun than what makes the most 

3394
02:41:25,141 --> 02:41:27,960
fun is you're engaged in the car,
you're shifting the gears,

3395
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:29,430
but smooth car.
Yeah.

3396
02:41:29,610 --> 02:41:30,860
Quiet.
Yeah.

3397
02:41:31,740 --> 02:41:32,573
Yeah.

3398
02:41:34,470 --> 02:41:37,200
He could learn how to drive a stick.
It's not hard.

3399
02:41:37,620 --> 02:41:39,870
I did it one time.
This guy taught me in rehab.

3400
02:41:40,050 --> 02:41:43,530
Huddah hood drivers take shifts.
We're going downhill though.

3401
02:41:43,710 --> 02:41:48,670
Oh well that's ridiculous.
Uphill and it was the worst,

3402
02:41:48,671 --> 02:41:49,504
the top of los anica you get to the top 
of laci and you're right when you get 

3403
02:41:51,361 --> 02:41:53,550
the sunset,
it's like a super steep hill.

3404
02:41:53,780 --> 02:41:55,980
You've got to have an outbreak,
and the new ones they don't have.

3405
02:41:56,010 --> 02:41:58,590
He breaks the new ones have a bullshit 
button,

3406
02:41:58,591 --> 02:41:59,424
e-brake,
so you'd have a handle that you just 

3407
02:42:00,691 --> 02:42:03,930
lift up and lift down those nonsense.
Fix that.

3408
02:42:04,160 --> 02:42:05,820
Like that's the whole deal.
If you're stuck in,

3409
02:42:05,821 --> 02:42:07,610
unlike san francisco street,
oh my god,

3410
02:42:07,780 --> 02:42:11,100
and need a red light and you got to go 
forward and in a stick shift.

3411
02:42:11,101 --> 02:42:11,934
That shit isn't heart attack inducing.
I'm always afraid of rolling back on 

3412
02:42:15,501 --> 02:42:15,880
that car.

3413
02:42:15,880 --> 02:42:16,840
Of course,
yeah,

3414
02:42:16,890 --> 02:42:17,723
you have to have an emergency brake and 
it's hard to do when you're a young kid 

3415
02:42:21,481 --> 02:42:22,314
and you're learning how to drive one and
you want a crazy steep hill at the top 

3416
02:42:24,691 --> 02:42:26,250
of the hill.
There's a stopLight like,

3417
02:42:26,310 --> 02:42:29,190
oh no,
that's designed for automatic cars.

3418
02:42:30,810 --> 02:42:33,890
If you have a stick shift,
that's a fucking pain in the ass,

3419
02:42:33,900 --> 02:42:36,450
man.
I can't even read a motorcycle.

3420
02:42:37,260 --> 02:42:38,590
Motorcycle stall out too,
right?

3421
02:42:38,610 --> 02:42:39,443
Same way.
So most motorcycle guys would probably 

3422
02:42:41,461 --> 02:42:43,470
be able to transition to a stick.
Pretty easy,

3423
02:42:44,580 --> 02:42:46,950
pretty simple.
Being a neutral.

3424
02:42:47,100 --> 02:42:48,090
Yeah,
I don't.

3425
02:42:48,300 --> 02:42:50,910
I never wrote him a motorcycle.
It took some classes for a little bit.

3426
02:42:51,540 --> 02:42:52,373
But then while I was taking classes,
a couple of people I knew wiped out 

3427
02:42:54,541 --> 02:42:55,530
pretty bad.
I was like,

3428
02:42:55,830 --> 02:42:57,930
fuck this,
this is too dangerous.

3429
02:42:58,670 --> 02:43:01,080
Ceo wrote a mini bike one time.
And um,

3430
02:43:01,330 --> 02:43:04,680
where were they in san jose?
This comedian named butch.

3431
02:43:05,210 --> 02:43:07,500
He let me ride it.
Many bucks.

3432
02:43:07,501 --> 02:43:10,260
Cool.
Someone without too much power.

3433
02:43:10,290 --> 02:43:12,040
It's cool.
It's when you get into

3434
02:43:12,040 --> 02:43:14,350
these like high abuses,
you know,

3435
02:43:14,351 --> 02:43:17,470
you could just go and buy something that
goes zero to 60 in a second.

3436
02:43:18,280 --> 02:43:21,220
The fuck is that.
You can just sell that to somebody.

3437
02:43:21,690 --> 02:43:23,080
You.
All you have to do is get a license.

3438
02:43:23,110 --> 02:43:23,943
You get a license.
And the dingo by the most insane two 

3439
02:43:27,250 --> 02:43:31,360
wheeled vehicle of the world could have 
ever.

3440
02:43:31,640 --> 02:43:34,690
You couldn't even imagine something like
this existing 100 years ago,

3441
02:43:35,170 --> 02:43:37,340
like 100 years ago,
if you went back to what,

3442
02:43:37,360 --> 02:43:38,193
19,
18 and somebody got a higher boost and 

3443
02:43:41,711 --> 02:43:42,880
brought it to you.
He be lIke,

3444
02:43:42,881 --> 02:43:47,860
what the fuck is this?
What is this that the rocket?

3445
02:43:48,060 --> 02:43:48,610
Yeah,
this is.

3446
02:43:48,610 --> 02:43:52,180
This doesn't even make sense.
People would try it and go flying off of

3447
02:43:52,181 --> 02:43:53,014
it.
We would do wheelies and fall on top of 

3448
02:43:54,521 --> 02:43:55,031
them.
They'd be like,

3449
02:43:55,031 --> 02:43:57,610
what in the fuck is this?
What are you doing with this thing?

3450
02:43:58,090 --> 02:43:58,923
And then someone could show it.
Someone who knows how to ride some real 

3451
02:44:01,420 --> 02:44:04,720
motorcycle race car driver guy,
evil knievel.

3452
02:44:05,420 --> 02:44:07,570
now like one of those guys that does 
this aisle of.

3453
02:44:08,050 --> 02:44:10,510
What's that irish?
Is it isle of man?

3454
02:44:11,110 --> 02:44:12,970
What does that irish.
A crazy race.

3455
02:44:12,971 --> 02:44:13,804
They do where these people are.
They're goIng so in sanely fast and it 

3456
02:44:18,881 --> 02:44:20,530
looks like they're going through the 
woods and shit.

3457
02:44:20,670 --> 02:44:21,503
I can do this.

3458
02:44:23,240 --> 02:44:25,880
Is that it is isle of man?
Yeah.

3459
02:44:26,450 --> 02:44:27,283
Why is there a car there in front?
Is the car for the cars driving with 

3460
02:44:31,041 --> 02:44:31,791
them?
Oh,

3461
02:44:31,791 --> 02:44:33,410
that guy just wiped out right there,
son.

3462
02:44:35,100 --> 02:44:36,840
Or these people that are driving

3463
02:44:38,350 --> 02:44:41,080
when it's not the race.
This might just be your normal time.

3464
02:44:41,081 --> 02:44:42,820
There might be doing their own race or 
something.

3465
02:44:42,830 --> 02:44:43,770
Yeah,
yeah,

3466
02:44:43,870 --> 02:44:45,490
yeah.
Maybe so.

3467
02:44:45,550 --> 02:44:46,500
I think so.
Hey,

3468
02:44:46,510 --> 02:44:50,590
this is the actual race.
This is the isle of man race and I don't

3469
02:44:50,591 --> 02:44:52,870
think they allow cars on the road while 
they have the race.

3470
02:44:53,260 --> 02:44:57,970
But do these guys go fast as shit?
It's crazy.

3471
02:44:57,971 --> 02:45:02,190
They take hills and they're flying 
through the air when they hit the hill.

3472
02:45:02,191 --> 02:45:03,910
So I look at that.
Fuck bro.

3473
02:45:04,570 --> 02:45:05,403
What is this like a fast.
He's going 171 miles an hour right 

3474
02:45:08,561 --> 02:45:09,370
there.
Yup.

3475
02:45:09,370 --> 02:45:14,370
And people to the left and to the right.
That is so insane.

3476
02:45:15,430 --> 02:45:18,610
Bikes are so insane.
And the fact that,

3477
02:45:18,980 --> 02:45:19,813
you know,
this is a fairly new thing in human 

3478
02:45:21,041 --> 02:45:23,620
history.
I mean this is new.

3479
02:45:24,070 --> 02:45:24,903
Within the last hundred years we had 
anything that you could do that with 

3480
02:45:29,010 --> 02:45:33,460
this speed that they could do it with.
now it's just fucking crazy man.

3481
02:45:34,060 --> 02:45:34,893
Like your,
your moment where you have to make a 

3482
02:45:36,671 --> 02:45:37,504
decision.
like if something jumps out in front of 

3483
02:45:39,041 --> 02:45:42,220
you,
how much time do you have be?

3484
02:45:43,210 --> 02:45:45,180
I'm still waiting for the jet pack.
Could look.

3485
02:45:45,190 --> 02:45:48,760
People are fucking stupid that someone 
wouldn't want to just go,

3486
02:45:48,761 --> 02:45:51,340
I'm going to run when he comes by,
as soon as I see them,

3487
02:45:51,370 --> 02:45:52,203
I'm going to run and I'm going to get 
out of the work and then he tries to 

3488
02:45:54,791 --> 02:45:58,960
correct for you and wipes out there.
Watch.

3489
02:46:01,190 --> 02:46:04,430
Yeah.
Yeah.

3490
02:46:04,431 --> 02:46:07,520
It's like he was doing a wheelie before 
he could even get off.

3491
02:46:08,270 --> 02:46:10,040
God this was that.
You

3492
02:46:10,040 --> 02:46:10,873
have to be so tuned in like I don't 
think we could even imagine how 

3493
02:46:14,421 --> 02:46:15,254
heightened your senses have to be to be 
able to stay on top of this where 

3494
02:46:19,581 --> 02:46:23,840
there's cars to the left and right and 
from you that alert man trees and shit.

3495
02:46:23,841 --> 02:46:28,160
His trees everywhere.
These guys are animals.

3496
02:46:29,060 --> 02:46:30,830
Look at him.
Fly over the top like that.

3497
02:46:31,850 --> 02:46:33,500
Fuck.
That is so bananas.

3498
02:46:34,180 --> 02:46:35,660
That is.
We watched them in.

3499
02:46:35,690 --> 02:46:38,510
There's a video in real time with them 
all going over this hill.

3500
02:46:38,511 --> 02:46:39,201
Yeah.
It's like that.

3501
02:46:39,201 --> 02:46:42,560
Like zoom.
You really get a sense of it right there

3502
02:46:42,590 --> 02:46:47,030
when you're.
When you're riding in the pov there pov,

3503
02:46:47,031 --> 02:46:47,864
you get a little bit of a sense of it,
but you really get a sense of it when 

3504
02:46:50,001 --> 02:46:52,550
you watch them pass by stationary 
cameras.

3505
02:46:52,730 --> 02:46:54,020
What else?
These guYs are.

3506
02:46:54,090 --> 02:46:54,923
My cousins sort of like this.
I know they like crazy people that 

3507
02:46:57,140 --> 02:46:58,400
pilots,
fighter pilots,

3508
02:46:58,440 --> 02:46:59,300
guys that go.

3509
02:46:59,390 --> 02:47:02,480
There are risk taken fools man,
and again,

3510
02:47:02,481 --> 02:47:04,250
this is just like what we were talking 
about,

3511
02:47:04,310 --> 02:47:07,550
what those strong men dudes.
These are the peOple that are.

3512
02:47:07,640 --> 02:47:08,473
They're hard Wired to do incredibly 
dangerous things and I guarantee you 

3513
02:47:12,531 --> 02:47:15,770
these same people that are hardwired to 
do these kinds of dangerous,

3514
02:47:15,771 --> 02:47:16,604
risky things.
They would be like special forces 

3515
02:47:18,711 --> 02:47:21,020
operators.
They would be navy seals.

3516
02:47:21,021 --> 02:47:21,854
They would be either.
They would be people that are most 

3517
02:47:23,631 --> 02:47:24,261
scenarios,
yeah.

3518
02:47:24,261 --> 02:47:25,094
They can do things that other people 
probably don't have the nerves for and 

3519
02:47:29,811 --> 02:47:30,644
they're thrill seekers like,
but then you could take a thrIll seeker 

3520
02:47:33,351 --> 02:47:37,010
that maybe would have joined the 
military and put a meal on a bike or put

3521
02:47:37,011 --> 02:47:37,844
them In an mma cage or put them in a 
boxing ring and you get that same type 

3522
02:47:41,931 --> 02:47:42,764
of person like that.
Those people all exist because you 

3523
02:47:45,591 --> 02:47:46,910
needed those traits.

3524
02:47:47,150 --> 02:47:49,340
You needed those traits in order to be 
successful,

3525
02:47:49,341 --> 02:47:52,340
to keep your civilization alive,
needed big,

3526
02:47:52,341 --> 02:47:53,840
strong,
murderous people.

3527
02:47:53,841 --> 02:47:56,420
You need people that were crazy and 
weren't afraid of danger.

3528
02:47:56,680 --> 02:47:59,360
You need a risk takers.
You need to reward seekers.

3529
02:47:59,361 --> 02:48:03,320
You needed people who wanted to be the 
king and if you didn't have that,

3530
02:48:03,321 --> 02:48:04,154
you weren't going to survive because 
there's other people that had that on 

3531
02:48:05,391 --> 02:48:06,224
the other side.
That's what's crazy is we're figuring 

3532
02:48:07,941 --> 02:48:08,774
out how to filter that shit into sports 
now and all sorts of other aspects of 

3533
02:48:12,501 --> 02:48:13,334
life,
but it's these same instincts that have 

3534
02:48:14,391 --> 02:48:15,224
been around for hundreds of thousands of
years that have turned people into what 

3535
02:48:18,081 --> 02:48:20,730
they are right now.
Fuck man.

3536
02:48:21,120 --> 02:48:24,590
It's a trip really as a trip when you 
think about people,

3537
02:48:24,591 --> 02:48:26,210
just people in general,
like what?

3538
02:48:26,480 --> 02:48:27,313
The paths that people take to become who
they are right now to be this guy on a 

3539
02:48:31,341 --> 02:48:33,950
jet pack going 100 miles an hour down a 
street.

3540
02:48:35,120 --> 02:48:36,340
How fast is he going?
Delivery.

3541
02:48:36,350 --> 02:48:38,040
We'd very,
very fast.

3542
02:48:38,570 --> 02:48:39,560
Very fast,
right?

3543
02:48:40,190 --> 02:48:41,120
Yeah.
He's flying.

3544
02:48:41,690 --> 02:48:44,870
Jesus christ.
This is one,

3545
02:48:44,871 --> 02:48:46,790
but this is not.
I don't think the fastest one.

3546
02:48:46,940 --> 02:48:47,773
This one,
it looks like a halo of jets around 

3547
02:48:49,011 --> 02:48:49,844
them,
but there's another guy that has one 

3548
02:48:50,870 --> 02:48:54,050
that are on his arms like,
like iron man.

3549
02:48:54,290 --> 02:48:56,660
This is pretty new to.
This was like the earlier this month.

3550
02:48:57,050 --> 02:49:00,170
You know they're going to get it.
If batteries get any better,

3551
02:49:00,350 --> 02:49:03,710
god would festival of speed.
Yeah,

3552
02:49:04,040 --> 02:49:05,810
they're gonna get it.
They're going to figure it out.

3553
02:49:05,870 --> 02:49:07,470
We're going to get hummingbird,
bro.

3554
02:49:08,010 --> 02:49:10,050
That's what it's going to be.
His have some shit.

3555
02:49:10,051 --> 02:49:10,884
Well,
it's like,

3556
02:49:10,900 --> 02:49:12,510
well,
you're goIng to buy some cheap ones.

3557
02:49:12,960 --> 02:49:16,610
You know some from genki ones from 
overseas and the hummingbird wings going

3558
02:49:16,611 --> 02:49:18,210
to break off and hit in the fucking 
head.

3559
02:49:21,570 --> 02:49:26,230
There'll be people to in delta knockoffs
wings.

3560
02:49:26,510 --> 02:49:28,290
Yeah.
And then it would definitely be trippers

3561
02:49:28,291 --> 02:49:29,124
that would put like glowing lights on 
them that would cause people to have 

3562
02:49:30,841 --> 02:49:32,370
seizures.
You know,

3563
02:49:32,480 --> 02:49:37,480
like for sure like burning man style 
lights over your hummingbird wings.

3564
02:49:37,950 --> 02:49:39,990
That would be amazing.
Come on.

3565
02:49:40,290 --> 02:49:41,910
There'll be one of the coolest things of
all time.

3566
02:49:43,110 --> 02:49:47,070
Burning man hummingbird.
Glowing flashing light wings.

3567
02:49:48,710 --> 02:49:49,770
That'd be bad ass.
Yeah,

3568
02:49:49,771 --> 02:49:50,601
man.
Burning man.

3569
02:49:50,601 --> 02:49:55,100
This artist wants to cover burning man 
in a massive nasa engineered blanket.

3570
02:49:55,840 --> 02:49:58,460
It's like 10,000
square or it.

3571
02:49:58,830 --> 02:50:00,500
Sorry,
100 square meters.

3572
02:50:00,560 --> 02:50:02,750
For what to trip?
Fall.

3573
02:50:02,780 --> 02:50:03,613
What would happen?
It's supposed to reflect 97 percent of 

3574
02:50:05,421 --> 02:50:06,830
the heat that would normally stay down 
there.

3575
02:50:06,831 --> 02:50:09,330
So they're going to do a portion of it.
I don't know if they're going to take.

3576
02:50:09,410 --> 02:50:10,490
Obviously can't cover that.
It's funny,

3577
02:50:10,610 --> 02:50:13,190
I was just reading about this.
They tell you to take one of those space

3578
02:50:13,191 --> 02:50:15,170
blankets with you.
If you're going hiking in the woods,

3579
02:50:15,410 --> 02:50:17,570
I'll give you go on a camping trip.
And um,

3580
02:50:17,650 --> 02:50:20,270
you know,
you have like some survival stuff,

3581
02:50:20,360 --> 02:50:22,250
a survival kit.
One of the things they say is to get one

3582
02:50:22,251 --> 02:50:23,084
of those because you build a fire and 
then you get under the blanket in the 

3583
02:50:27,051 --> 02:50:31,190
fire and the fire reflects off the 
blanket and it makes a big impact on the

3584
02:50:31,191 --> 02:50:35,420
amount of heat it gives off and they 
think like for survival purposes,

3585
02:50:35,870 --> 02:50:40,870
it's a good move to have.
Where did I,

3586
02:50:41,360 --> 02:50:44,780
where did I hear that?
About a think I heard that on a podcast

3587
02:50:48,630 --> 02:50:50,760
trying to figure out which podcast it 
was.

3588
02:50:50,761 --> 02:50:52,800
I'll try to remember.
But the um,

3589
02:50:52,920 --> 02:50:57,920
those little tiny blankets,
they don't weigh anything either.

3590
02:50:57,960 --> 02:50:59,930
So it's like a smart thing for people to
carry around with,

3591
02:51:00,200 --> 02:51:05,200
through the qbr.
Warm supposedly never seen one warmer,

3592
02:51:05,640 --> 02:51:07,830
but they're really good apparently for 
a,

3593
02:51:07,920 --> 02:51:11,010
for reflecting heat.
Like they can keep your body heat in,

3594
02:51:12,130 --> 02:51:12,660
you know,
and,

3595
02:51:12,660 --> 02:51:15,620
and pretty effective compared to their 
size and weight,

3596
02:51:15,960 --> 02:51:16,793
just like we're legit when they wrap 
people around the chipotle burritos to 

3597
02:51:20,001 --> 02:51:21,300
go.
I know they do.

3598
02:51:21,700 --> 02:51:24,270
Looks like there's nothing to it,
but maybe that's why chipotle,

3599
02:51:24,271 --> 02:51:28,990
he uses those wraps.
I got food.

3600
02:51:29,040 --> 02:51:32,120
Poison that you pull it twice.
You think you did in dc,

3601
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:33,833
how do you know?
That's exactly where he got the food 

3602
02:51:34,731 --> 02:51:37,880
poisoning of the last thing I ate.
right.

3603
02:51:38,300 --> 02:51:39,133
And then how much time did it take 
between eating and you're getting food 

3604
02:51:41,871 --> 02:51:42,920
poisoning?
One hour,

3605
02:51:43,160 --> 02:51:46,130
one hour,
but I felt like I felt like getting hot.

3606
02:51:46,240 --> 02:51:49,190
Then I just threw up.
And before that,

3607
02:51:49,240 --> 02:51:50,570
um,
one hour.

3608
02:51:50,571 --> 02:51:55,571
What did you eat?
Did you eat anything else earlier?

3609
02:51:56,840 --> 02:51:58,480
Okay.
It was,

3610
02:51:58,510 --> 02:52:01,880
it was the plane eight hours before the 
food poisoning kicked in.

3611
02:52:02,300 --> 02:52:03,530
I don't know,
maybe three,

3612
02:52:03,680 --> 02:52:05,380
three.
The fly with hours.

3613
02:52:05,380 --> 02:52:10,380
I know that that's what I think most 
experts have never talked to.

3614
02:52:11,030 --> 02:52:11,863
Food poisoning expert.
I don't want to bullshit you because I 

3615
02:52:13,301 --> 02:52:14,134
think most people will say that it's 
more likely that it was the food that 

3616
02:52:16,781 --> 02:52:19,390
was on the plane that got you.
Why didn't you get in a plane?

3617
02:52:19,570 --> 02:52:19,901
Oh,
he didn't,

3618
02:52:19,901 --> 02:52:21,070
you know,
latin fireproof,

3619
02:52:21,110 --> 02:52:22,060
cloud.
You're nuts.

3620
02:52:22,960 --> 02:52:23,793
You might have gotten it from nuts.
You sure it was food poisoning and not 

3621
02:52:25,751 --> 02:52:27,730
just like stomach flu.
I don't know man,

3622
02:52:27,731 --> 02:52:30,160
but it was bad for like three days.
I lost 14 pounds,

3623
02:52:30,280 --> 02:52:32,200
you know,
whenever people say I got food poisoning

3624
02:52:32,201 --> 02:52:33,760
from this,
I always go.

3625
02:52:33,761 --> 02:52:38,050
You might have,
but I mean people don't know how long it

3626
02:52:38,051 --> 02:52:40,470
takes to get food poisoning.
It'S a little chicken.

3627
02:52:41,130 --> 02:52:42,040
it was chicken.
You think?

3628
02:52:42,400 --> 02:52:43,233
How many,
how many hours does it take before food 

3629
02:52:44,081 --> 02:52:45,250
wasn't chose that one to three.

3630
02:52:45,370 --> 02:52:45,671
One,
two,

3631
02:52:45,671 --> 02:52:46,151
three.
Oh,

3632
02:52:46,151 --> 02:52:48,940
maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe one of the cerner had dirty hands.

3633
02:52:48,970 --> 02:52:51,630
Maybe they used to think it was longer.
Did they used to think it was longer?

3634
02:52:51,760 --> 02:52:53,890
Because I used to hear that it was like 
eight hours.

3635
02:52:53,980 --> 02:52:55,270
I thought you had to wait for it to 
digest,

3636
02:52:55,271 --> 02:52:57,340
but you Can eat something.
That makes sense.

3637
02:52:57,341 --> 02:52:58,174
Then probably wester polar then.
But I would say if you had eaten three 

3638
02:53:01,781 --> 02:53:03,260
hours earlier and then right after she 
went.

3639
02:53:03,261 --> 02:53:04,930
Well,
if they're saying one,

3640
02:53:04,931 --> 02:53:05,321
two,
three,

3641
02:53:05,321 --> 02:53:06,670
one is one.
Depends what it is,

3642
02:53:06,671 --> 02:53:11,671
I suppose to roast chicken or clothing.
That's scary.

3643
02:53:13,240 --> 02:53:15,500
People get that from salad.
Yeah.

3644
02:53:15,960 --> 02:53:16,793
Yeah.
Run off man's runoff from the animal 

3645
02:53:19,300 --> 02:53:21,940
areas.
Animal shit essentially.

3646
02:53:22,880 --> 02:53:25,300
Right?
A lot of times when they have these,

3647
02:53:25,301 --> 02:53:27,460
um,
these farms,

3648
02:53:27,940 --> 02:53:28,773
you'll get it rains and there's a lot of
runoff and the runoff is carrying cow 

3649
02:53:32,141 --> 02:53:32,974
shit and pig shit and it's getting into 
the ground and it's getting onto plants 

3650
02:53:37,840 --> 02:53:42,520
and if they don't adequately wash these 
plants and you get them and you eat them

3651
02:53:42,521 --> 02:53:44,620
raw,
you can definitely get sick.

3652
02:53:45,030 --> 02:53:45,863
See what google that eco lie.
What is the cause of eco lie in 

3653
02:53:49,781 --> 02:53:50,614
vegetables?
I'm preTty sure that's the reason 

3654
02:53:53,020 --> 02:53:54,970
sometimes when you,
when you want to drive to,

3655
02:53:54,971 --> 02:53:59,230
like when I do show them by salary or 
bakersfield on the right hand side,

3656
02:53:59,231 --> 02:54:00,550
you know,
you pass by um,

3657
02:54:00,880 --> 02:54:02,290
these cows.
Yeah.

3658
02:54:02,310 --> 02:54:04,570
And then there's a lake and I always 
thought that was water,

3659
02:54:05,200 --> 02:54:06,033
but it was brought off a lake and lake.
The whole lake full of culture just 

3660
02:54:11,651 --> 02:54:13,390
didn't do that.
so dark.

3661
02:54:14,290 --> 02:54:15,520
there's a lake,
fill a pig,

3662
02:54:15,521 --> 02:54:20,290
shit outside this one pig farm on of 
those factory farms that where they have

3663
02:54:20,291 --> 02:54:21,124
these warehouses filled with pigs and 
they flew over with a drone to get 

3664
02:54:23,921 --> 02:54:24,754
footage of it.
And you see This putrid disgusting body 

3665
02:54:29,471 --> 02:54:32,590
of water.
That's just shit and piss and mean.

3666
02:54:32,591 --> 02:54:34,870
It's massive.
It's massive.

3667
02:54:34,920 --> 02:54:39,500
I mean it's like a lake that you would 
think that you'd go fishing in the end.

3668
02:54:39,600 --> 02:54:41,290
Where are we going to put all that 
stuff?

3669
02:54:41,650 --> 02:54:42,311
I don't know,
man.

3670
02:54:42,311 --> 02:54:45,610
It's going to go into the ground.
They're not supposed to do that.

3671
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:46,833
You know this.
this thing of figuring out how to make 

3672
02:54:48,731 --> 02:54:53,470
the most amount of money with having the
least amount of concerns for the life of

3673
02:54:53,471 --> 02:54:56,290
the animal is the total wrong way to 
look at it.

3674
02:54:56,440 --> 02:54:57,273
It's just.
But when you're feeding 20 million 

3675
02:54:59,471 --> 02:55:01,780
people and none of those people were 
aware of where their food comes,

3676
02:55:01,960 --> 02:55:02,793
people start making based on money and 
profit and then you get to this point 

3677
02:55:05,631 --> 02:55:08,900
where someone allows them to where we 
don't agree on what should and shouldn't

3678
02:55:08,901 --> 02:55:09,734
be done or we don't agree on what we 
should and shouldn't have force in 

3679
02:55:12,050 --> 02:55:12,883
force,
and then we get to this place where you 

3680
02:55:14,091 --> 02:55:14,924
have these buildings that are filled 
with pigs and you've got a lake of piss 

3681
02:55:17,351 --> 02:55:19,560
and shit behind it and these things are 
jammed,

3682
02:55:19,620 --> 02:55:21,980
these cages and they got a dead babies 
on the ground and you're like,

3683
02:55:21,981 --> 02:55:23,630
okay,
what's that?

3684
02:55:23,690 --> 02:55:26,840
That seems like hell like you've.
You've created hell so that you can make

3685
02:55:26,841 --> 02:55:28,540
bacon like that.
That is a.

3686
02:55:28,610 --> 02:55:29,443
That's crazy.
That's a crazy way of contracting or 

3687
02:55:32,630 --> 02:55:35,090
getting your food,
but bacon tastes so good.

3688
02:55:35,300 --> 02:55:38,150
I know ecolab is a large group of 
bacteria with multiple strains,

3689
02:55:38,151 --> 02:55:38,984
most of which are harmless and part of 
the normal flora of bacteria in the 

3690
02:55:41,661 --> 02:55:42,494
digestive tract.
HarmfuL strains of ecolab produced 

3691
02:55:44,751 --> 02:55:47,720
something called shiga toxin,
which can be deadly.

3692
02:55:48,800 --> 02:55:49,633
The strain an under cooked ground beef,
it's infected people through the 

3693
02:55:53,781 --> 02:55:56,840
consumption of undercooked ground beef 
some,

3694
02:55:56,890 --> 02:55:59,780
so it's a,
it's a toxin than exists in cattle.

3695
02:56:00,290 --> 02:56:02,630
Okay.
here it goes this time.

3696
02:56:02,631 --> 02:56:03,464
However,
the toxic strain of ecolab has been 

3697
02:56:04,941 --> 02:56:05,774
found on romaine lettuce,
which likely became contaminated from 

3698
02:56:08,841 --> 02:56:10,370
nearby cattle manure.
So yeah,

3699
02:56:10,371 --> 02:56:13,530
that's what It is,
is the recent outbreak and yeah,

3700
02:56:13,540 --> 02:56:15,860
it's.
I think it's happened before that I read

3701
02:56:15,861 --> 02:56:19,160
about it as well with the other stuff.
I think it was spinach.

3702
02:56:19,460 --> 02:56:21,260
I think they had an issue with spinach 
in the past,

3703
02:56:21,261 --> 02:56:24,740
which was getting hoever when the,
when the news came out,

3704
02:56:25,120 --> 02:56:25,953
joe the other lower watching smith 
perform and he had a spirit as job it 

3705
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:32,930
was,
but it was hilarious to us.

3706
02:56:33,020 --> 02:56:35,000
He said,
I'm spinach.

3707
02:56:35,080 --> 02:56:35,810
It,
um,

3708
02:56:35,810 --> 02:56:37,570
there's a,
the,

3709
02:56:37,780 --> 02:56:38,071
the,
the,

3710
02:56:38,071 --> 02:56:38,904
the thing of spanish.
And then he said it was a good time to 

3711
02:56:41,300 --> 02:56:42,260
beat up popeye.

3712
02:56:45,440 --> 02:56:48,600
That's a typical phrase.
He's so silly.

3713
02:56:49,740 --> 02:56:51,150
He's a funny dude either,
buddy.

3714
02:56:51,490 --> 02:56:53,500
He's so silly.
Very nice guy though,

3715
02:56:53,501 --> 02:56:54,050
isn't he?
Yeah,

3716
02:56:54,050 --> 02:56:57,010
he's very nice guy.
Funny dude though,

3717
02:56:57,040 --> 02:56:58,970
that like that kind of joke.
Like,

3718
02:56:59,450 --> 02:57:02,420
wow.
No,

3719
02:57:02,430 --> 02:57:06,440
it's a good time to beat up popeye guys.
Yeah.

3720
02:57:06,441 --> 02:57:07,274
Um,
but that's not from the vegetables 

3721
02:57:08,601 --> 02:57:10,460
themselves.
That's the thing like that,

3722
02:57:10,580 --> 02:57:11,413
those kinds of diseases or from their 
environmental toxins from the nearby 

3723
02:57:14,481 --> 02:57:17,000
stuff.
So the letter was grown.

3724
02:57:17,090 --> 02:57:21,590
It grew with equally in it on it,
it caught on it somehow.

3725
02:57:22,400 --> 02:57:23,233
The cattle manure.
So even washing that letter is you 

3726
02:57:25,581 --> 02:57:26,810
couldn't not take it out.
Well,

3727
02:57:26,811 --> 02:57:28,520
thank you.
Can I think you can.

3728
02:57:28,640 --> 02:57:31,130
I think if you washed lettuce you can 
take it out,

3729
02:57:31,250 --> 02:57:33,770
but if you cook it you much more likely 
to kill it.

3730
02:57:34,010 --> 02:57:34,843
Like for broccoli and stuff like that,
you're much more likely to be able to 

3731
02:57:37,431 --> 02:57:38,780
kill it.
You know,

3732
02:57:38,810 --> 02:57:39,643
kale stir fried kale.
But the crazy thing is like had that 

3733
02:57:42,441 --> 02:57:43,274
happened in the first place,
like was that a normal thing that would 

3734
02:57:45,111 --> 02:57:46,760
have happened on a regular farm?

3735
02:57:47,240 --> 02:57:48,073
Like if you just,
if you just had a farm that wasn't a 

3736
02:57:49,401 --> 02:57:53,330
factory farm is just let the animals 
roam around just be themselves.

3737
02:57:53,690 --> 02:57:55,400
Would that have happened?
Is it still possible?

3738
02:57:55,401 --> 02:57:59,450
Or is it only happened when you can 
contain a certain amount of animals?

3739
02:57:59,451 --> 02:58:00,284
In a certain area,
and then also try to grow vegetables in 

3740
02:58:01,831 --> 02:58:04,980
that same area too.
I mean,

3741
02:58:04,981 --> 02:58:07,020
I'm sure people got eco lie back in the 
day.

3742
02:58:07,200 --> 02:58:09,410
I'm sure it's not a new thing that 
people get sick from guest.

3743
02:58:09,480 --> 02:58:11,730
They didn't clean it well enough,
but the way they're doing it,

3744
02:58:11,780 --> 02:58:14,580
it's probably before refrigerators for 
sure.

3745
02:58:14,581 --> 02:58:15,950
They probably got it right.
Yeah,

3746
02:58:16,090 --> 02:58:19,710
they must've got it like crazy.
I bet people got food poisoning left and

3747
02:58:19,711 --> 02:58:21,880
right before refrigerators.
Oh yeah man.

3748
02:58:22,530 --> 02:58:25,350
Oh,
before always had diarrhea before.

3749
02:58:26,630 --> 02:58:28,320
I know right before they was telling 
you,

3750
02:58:28,321 --> 02:58:30,460
um,
come to our restaurant,

3751
02:58:30,480 --> 02:58:32,010
our shift washing his hands.

3752
02:58:32,510 --> 02:58:35,310
Do you ever catch your dog eating some 
in the backyard and you're like,

3753
02:58:35,340 --> 02:58:36,173
oh,
well for short it's going to be sick 

3754
02:58:37,381 --> 02:58:38,520
now.
Meanwhile,

3755
02:58:38,521 --> 02:58:42,300
nothing dead rat.
They can find a dead rat.

3756
02:58:42,301 --> 02:58:44,100
And you catch them chewing on a dead rat
and you're like,

3757
02:58:44,101 --> 02:58:44,934
what the fuck dude?
I thought we were friends while you 

3758
02:58:47,431 --> 02:58:48,720
eating a dead rat.
Man,

3759
02:58:48,721 --> 02:58:51,090
that's so stupid.
Getting the house.

3760
02:58:51,091 --> 02:58:53,160
We've got nice next and sell the house,
you know.

3761
02:58:53,161 --> 02:58:53,821
And I'm thinking,
man,

3762
02:58:53,821 --> 02:58:55,470
he's going to be sick.
He had a rat,

3763
02:58:55,590 --> 02:58:57,630
nothing,
zero problems.

3764
02:58:57,660 --> 02:58:59,730
Ate steak.
One time I left in my car overnight.

3765
02:59:00,540 --> 02:59:04,060
didn't know us can be a great lunch.
All these tips.

3766
02:59:04,470 --> 02:59:06,960
It was so good eating it too,
and I was sick for like three days.

3767
02:59:07,100 --> 02:59:08,340
Oh,
so bad.

3768
02:59:08,760 --> 02:59:11,590
Bad lesson learned.
Did you try to reheat in the microwave?

3769
02:59:11,650 --> 02:59:13,290
Yeah,
I put it in a skillet to a thing.

3770
02:59:13,290 --> 02:59:15,090
I was working at a restaurant.
No,

3771
02:59:15,630 --> 02:59:18,840
we made all the time.
So you knew they probably had to cook it

3772
02:59:18,841 --> 02:59:20,670
again and you thought it would be fine?
Yeah,

3773
02:59:20,671 --> 02:59:22,740
I thought it was.
I thought it was in the clear.

3774
02:59:23,160 --> 02:59:26,490
I in like seven day old kfc,
but it was the refrigerator.

3775
02:59:26,530 --> 02:59:28,350
I don't even cook it.
Did that get you?

3776
02:59:28,410 --> 02:59:29,230
It was good.
No.

3777
02:59:29,230 --> 02:59:31,720
No kid would see cold rocks.
No.

3778
02:59:31,740 --> 02:59:35,130
My favorite kfc is kfc.
Cold with hot sauce.

3779
02:59:35,690 --> 02:59:36,523
Like les hecka habanero sauce.
That green ship matea doesn't have the 

3780
02:59:41,041 --> 02:59:44,730
kind of kick though a that need more.
I need more.

3781
02:59:45,150 --> 02:59:47,160
It doesn't have the cake.
The spice,

3782
02:59:47,161 --> 02:59:50,010
but not the real big kick.
Like although like dave's hot sauce,

3783
02:59:50,011 --> 02:59:54,630
maybe that's too much.
There's a line,

3784
02:59:54,631 --> 02:59:55,650
we're like,
what are you doing?

3785
02:59:55,800 --> 02:59:57,870
What are you doing?
Fucking,

3786
02:59:58,110 --> 02:59:58,943
you know,
do you want to stunt like why are you 

3787
03:00:00,341 --> 03:00:02,250
eating that?
You have doritos are good though.

3788
03:00:02,340 --> 03:00:05,070
They're very good.
But I mean there's like a habanero,

3789
03:00:05,080 --> 03:00:05,913
so there's a level of hot.
How about middle of the fucking hot 

3790
03:00:07,591 --> 03:00:08,560
though?
How many arrows?

3791
03:00:08,570 --> 03:00:12,480
How the fuck it's hot enough so I'm as 
fuck like that.

3792
03:00:12,481 --> 03:00:13,470
You could tech.
oh shit.

3793
03:00:13,740 --> 03:00:16,480
There's a lot of good habanero sauces.
lot.

3794
03:00:16,570 --> 03:00:20,310
a lot of good ones.
But the habanero sauce on cold chicken.

3795
03:00:23,290 --> 03:00:24,380
Woo.

3796
03:00:25,110 --> 03:00:25,980
god,
that's good.

3797
03:00:26,920 --> 03:00:29,250
Does your favorite terrible chicken?
No chance?

3798
03:00:29,310 --> 03:00:30,480
No.
No.

3799
03:00:31,180 --> 03:00:32,440
Uh,
I don't.

3800
03:00:32,520 --> 03:00:33,353
I mean I try not to eat it unless I have
to from starving and that's all it's 

3801
03:00:36,931 --> 03:00:38,910
available.
But most of the time I think,

3802
03:00:38,911 --> 03:00:41,010
man,
how are they getting these chickens?

3803
03:00:41,190 --> 03:00:44,130
These are those tortured chickens.
They live in those boxes.

3804
03:00:44,160 --> 03:00:44,701
Yeah.
These tickets.

3805
03:00:44,701 --> 03:00:45,534
I have bigger breasts.
But then you pass by chick fil a and 

3806
03:00:47,341 --> 03:00:48,720
you're like,
what's the line about?

3807
03:00:49,020 --> 03:00:50,670
What's the bonds of line?
So big.

3808
03:00:51,070 --> 03:00:52,650
must be delicious.
Oh,

3809
03:00:52,850 --> 03:00:55,680
I could taste a bond in the mayonnaise 
chicken.

3810
03:00:56,370 --> 03:00:57,840
Sweet,
sweet,

3811
03:00:57,841 --> 03:00:59,470
juicy,
warm chicken.

3812
03:00:59,980 --> 03:01:03,670
I used to fuck with a little chicken.
Littles from kfc,

3813
03:01:03,671 --> 03:01:07,420
a little dollar sandwiches.
The thing is,

3814
03:01:07,421 --> 03:01:08,254
man,
what you know what happened to get that 

3815
03:01:11,251 --> 03:01:13,270
chicken sandwich in your hand?
If you get a video,

3816
03:01:13,360 --> 03:01:14,193
if they give you a little fucking every 
every chicken sandwich you put chicken 

3817
03:01:18,360 --> 03:01:21,520
sandwich you,
it comes to the documented life of,

3818
03:01:21,521 --> 03:01:24,370
of the chicken,
you know you could get a number like,

3819
03:01:24,400 --> 03:01:24,900
oh,
this,

3820
03:01:24,900 --> 03:01:26,260
this number two,
one six,

3821
03:01:26,261 --> 03:01:27,094
and you go to the website and you can 
access the video of the chicken living 

3822
03:01:29,651 --> 03:01:31,030
from the tower to baby check.

3823
03:01:31,070 --> 03:01:31,903
So time it's grown up.
Check and a dude will fucking gloved 

3824
03:01:33,761 --> 03:01:34,594
hand grabs this fucker.
Stuffs them in a cage and feed them and 

3825
03:01:37,271 --> 03:01:39,940
it gets bigger and he's stuck in this 
cage and they'd take them out,

3826
03:01:40,090 --> 03:01:40,923
whack his fucking head off,
throw them into the furnace to blow off 

3827
03:01:43,871 --> 03:01:47,470
all his feathers,
pull the guts out of them,

3828
03:01:48,180 --> 03:01:51,130
cook them at kfc.
If you could see all that,

3829
03:01:51,580 --> 03:01:53,650
if you saw it from start to finish,
you'd be like,

3830
03:01:54,100 --> 03:01:56,180
what are the italian homeless doing 
here?

3831
03:01:56,860 --> 03:02:00,760
They're going to tell you how much water
was used to food to feed this guy.

3832
03:02:01,200 --> 03:02:02,290
Well,
we need more water.

3833
03:02:02,320 --> 03:02:03,190
Yeah,
for sure.

3834
03:02:03,191 --> 03:02:04,024
But that doesn't disturb me as much as 
like the life of a pig that lives in a 

3835
03:02:09,491 --> 03:02:12,280
cage that's in a warehouse filled with 
cages.

3836
03:02:12,281 --> 03:02:15,350
That's created a river of shit right 
next to a swimming.

3837
03:02:16,180 --> 03:02:17,500
I like wild animals,
man.

3838
03:02:17,560 --> 03:02:18,393
I liked the way they taste.
I like the idea behind it was that most 

3839
03:02:20,860 --> 03:02:23,410
days like it tastes good.
Tastes delicious.

3840
03:02:24,340 --> 03:02:26,290
Burgers.
At one time in beer,

3841
03:02:26,630 --> 03:02:27,463
my uncle would cook.
He would come and he will make it like 

3842
03:02:32,081 --> 03:02:33,850
carne asada,
poor whatever.

3843
03:02:34,840 --> 03:02:37,460
Sausages.
And um,

3844
03:02:38,350 --> 03:02:39,183
it was good.
A lot of people saw a lot of americans 

3845
03:02:42,011 --> 03:02:44,830
go to Mexico to deer hunt the evidence.
Another big deer hunting.

3846
03:02:45,150 --> 03:02:46,320
Yeah.
Um,

3847
03:02:47,560 --> 03:02:48,393
what is there?
There's another place where it starts 

3848
03:02:50,460 --> 03:02:51,330
with an s.
So nora,

3849
03:02:51,430 --> 03:02:54,310
so nora.
So nora has a lot of big deer there.

3850
03:02:54,460 --> 03:02:57,490
People go there to hunt deer.
Scared as fuck.

3851
03:02:57,491 --> 03:02:59,020
They're scared.
Who going to Mexico?

3852
03:02:59,320 --> 03:03:01,810
We're going to get me,
get me while I'm over here.

3853
03:03:02,320 --> 03:03:03,220
It's weird,
man.

3854
03:03:05,100 --> 03:03:07,030
They hunt deer over there.
And turn them into tacos.

3855
03:03:08,010 --> 03:03:13,010
Does it all wild ranging a free ranging 
a herd of buffalo in Mexico to really.

3856
03:03:13,950 --> 03:03:15,150
Yeah,
the most.

3857
03:03:15,180 --> 03:03:17,360
The shutter movie there one time and 
brought in buffalo.

3858
03:03:17,361 --> 03:03:18,194
Then they left them there.
I wonder because I've helped buffalo's 

3859
03:03:20,700 --> 03:03:21,533
buffalo's then.
So catalina island or I don't know 

3860
03:03:23,921 --> 03:03:25,300
where.
Catalina,

3861
03:03:25,301 --> 03:03:25,760
right?
Yeah.

3862
03:03:25,760 --> 03:03:26,593
They asked.
Well how to get there while they shot a 

3863
03:03:27,551 --> 03:03:29,410
movie.
Was that he brought in her buffalo.

3864
03:03:29,411 --> 03:03:31,060
They left them there.
Oh,

3865
03:03:31,061 --> 03:03:31,894
that's interesting.
They used to be an island like one of 

3866
03:03:34,751 --> 03:03:35,584
those islands off the coast of 
California that had all kinds of wild 

3867
03:03:38,681 --> 03:03:41,890
animals that people brought all these 
animals over there to try to turn into a

3868
03:03:41,891 --> 03:03:45,250
wild game park.
They had like deer and elk and all kinds

3869
03:03:45,251 --> 03:03:46,084
of shit.
Roman runs one island and then the 

3870
03:03:47,321 --> 03:03:48,570
biologist said,
yeah,

3871
03:03:48,640 --> 03:03:49,570
enough of that,
like,

3872
03:03:49,571 --> 03:03:51,310
this is crazy.
You've got to tie.

3873
03:03:51,460 --> 03:03:53,500
ALl these things are breeding.
there's no predators.

3874
03:03:53,501 --> 03:03:57,320
Like this is eco disaster.
Then human beings have created.

3875
03:03:58,160 --> 03:04:01,370
So the store that I had heard was that 
they decided to gun them all down.

3876
03:04:01,730 --> 03:04:04,360
I want to find out fast,
true jamie funnel.

3877
03:04:04,370 --> 03:04:06,770
If that's true,
channel islands,

3878
03:04:06,860 --> 03:04:08,160
is that what it was?
Channel islands.

3879
03:04:08,250 --> 03:04:09,083
It's one of those.
I did a show at a military gigging and 

3880
03:04:11,071 --> 03:04:13,110
one of the islands.
St nicholas island.

3881
03:04:13,410 --> 03:04:15,030
Oh yeah.
You were telling me about this.

3882
03:04:15,120 --> 03:04:16,260
Yeah.
Yeah.

3883
03:04:16,261 --> 03:04:17,780
You told me about this awhile ago,
right?

3884
03:04:17,820 --> 03:04:18,820
Yeah,
it was,

3885
03:04:18,830 --> 03:04:19,663
uh,
it was a,

3886
03:04:19,690 --> 03:04:23,760
it was like a,
they do they do the test nuclear weapons

3887
03:04:23,761 --> 03:04:25,240
there in the ocean?
Yeah.

3888
03:04:25,380 --> 03:04:26,960
And um,
it was just,

3889
03:04:27,510 --> 03:04:28,343
it was just a quick gig at a bar and it 
was crazy because the show ended at 10 

3890
03:04:33,181 --> 03:04:34,014
and against the bar closes at 11,
but like five minutes before the bar 

3891
03:04:37,981 --> 03:04:42,540
close,
10 military police came in and make sure

3892
03:04:42,550 --> 03:04:44,190
it's close.
Wow.

3893
03:04:44,370 --> 03:04:45,203
And then we left that one.
they say we're leaving at five in the 

3894
03:04:47,011 --> 03:04:49,560
morning.
They're leaving at five in the morning.

3895
03:04:50,280 --> 03:04:53,480
There was no lagging.
Like I was running late that they almost

3896
03:04:53,490 --> 03:04:55,080
left without me.
Oh shit.

3897
03:04:55,790 --> 03:04:56,623
This was five in the morning.
We're supposed to get off your face and 

3898
03:04:57,871 --> 03:04:58,950
head to your flight.
Yeah.

3899
03:04:59,010 --> 03:04:59,491
Well,
yeah,

3900
03:04:59,491 --> 03:05:01,710
you can't fuck around their son.
We did some.

3901
03:05:01,711 --> 03:05:05,850
Ufc isn't military military basis.
We did quite a few of them there,

3902
03:05:06,510 --> 03:05:07,343
you know,
did the one down in san diego we've 

3903
03:05:09,991 --> 03:05:10,710
done,
um,

3904
03:05:10,710 --> 03:05:13,920
in Texas,
denim in North Carolina,

3905
03:05:13,921 --> 03:05:15,510
I believe denim,
a lot of different places,

3906
03:05:15,511 --> 03:05:16,344
but they get super enthusiastic man 
fights on the basis and they would be 

3907
03:05:20,560 --> 03:05:24,600
on.
I think they did it on spike tv.

3908
03:05:24,840 --> 03:05:29,840
I think there Was on spike at the time,
but a heavy shit man,

3909
03:05:30,470 --> 03:05:32,040
it's interesting.
Really interesting.

3910
03:05:33,120 --> 03:05:35,770
Might've did it on fox two maybe on fs 
one,

3911
03:05:36,410 --> 03:05:37,021
uh,
one of those.

3912
03:05:37,021 --> 03:05:39,180
Fox sports channels.
Maybe fox sports one,

3913
03:05:39,780 --> 03:05:40,613
but it's not like nothing else man.
when especially with military guys 

3914
03:05:44,131 --> 03:05:44,964
fight.
If one of the guys is Like a one time 

3915
03:05:46,141 --> 03:05:46,974
tim kennedy was fighting and he's 
fighting a hot towel who's a real world 

3916
03:05:51,721 --> 03:05:52,290
class fighter.

3917
03:05:52,290 --> 03:05:53,123
Real tough fight.
And tim kennedy caught him with a left 

3918
03:05:54,811 --> 03:05:55,644
hook,
just boom drops and with this left hook 

3919
03:05:57,330 --> 03:06:00,030
and then he's on top of the cage and 
they're cheering amendment.

3920
03:06:00,031 --> 03:06:02,280
I mean the we had gone to the break to 
like,

3921
03:06:02,500 --> 03:06:05,310
it wasn't doing this for the cameras who
was doing this,

3922
03:06:05,311 --> 03:06:06,144
like to express himself to these people 
that he just fought for their screaming 

3923
03:06:08,191 --> 03:06:11,370
and cheering for them and the corn nuts 
and he's pointing at them telling them I

3924
03:06:11,371 --> 03:06:12,540
love you.
I love you.

3925
03:06:13,010 --> 03:06:16,890
Then I'm doing this for you guys.
it's heavy shit,

3926
03:06:16,891 --> 03:06:17,520
man.

3927
03:06:17,520 --> 03:06:18,353
A fellow soldier is that,
that base and then they all cheer for 

3928
03:06:22,051 --> 03:06:25,860
him and he wins like that.
It's intense.

3929
03:06:26,550 --> 03:06:27,383
It's intense human beings.
How appreciative of the people that are 

3930
03:06:29,581 --> 03:06:30,414
for you guys.
Super,

3931
03:06:30,420 --> 03:06:32,380
super,
super happy with anybody.

3932
03:06:32,730 --> 03:06:33,500
Not just so

3933
03:06:33,500 --> 03:06:37,430
do you see anybody but to have like a 
crazy event like a ufc on their base and

3934
03:06:37,431 --> 03:06:39,350
they get to go and see it,
you know?

3935
03:06:39,620 --> 03:06:43,520
So a great treat for them.
Break up the monotony.

3936
03:06:43,850 --> 03:06:46,140
That's good for the morale man.
Fall camp.

3937
03:06:46,340 --> 03:06:47,173
That's big man.
You got to have morale and the vikings 

3938
03:06:48,891 --> 03:06:50,360
do that.
Especially did mushrooms.

3939
03:06:50,420 --> 03:06:51,253
People love like,
I'm pretty like people who listen to 

3940
03:06:53,541 --> 03:06:54,374
your show man,
you don't know like how happy you make 

3941
03:06:56,641 --> 03:06:57,474
them.
You know what I run into people when 

3942
03:06:58,431 --> 03:06:59,620
they say,
oh bro,

3943
03:07:00,100 --> 03:07:03,650
for taking me on go and they always talk
about,

3944
03:07:03,660 --> 03:07:05,470
oh bro,
like they will say,

3945
03:07:05,471 --> 03:07:08,970
I wake up to you to you,
and they talk about you,

3946
03:07:09,010 --> 03:07:13,620
like they want to be here.
They like everything you say,

3947
03:07:13,621 --> 03:07:14,454
man.
And,

3948
03:07:15,810 --> 03:07:17,020
and I remember,
um,

3949
03:07:17,470 --> 03:07:18,303
when I was walking down the street the 
other day and I ran into a guy and he 

3950
03:07:22,021 --> 03:07:24,390
told me I'm a man,
I'm,

3951
03:07:24,870 --> 03:07:29,410
I was locked up in corcoran state prison
for two years,

3952
03:07:29,460 --> 03:07:30,930

Oh guess what were they called it the 
whole block was rooting for you.

3959

3960
03:07:46,861 --> 03:07:48,060

Inmates are watching me and they're

03:08:15,930 --> 03:08:20,520
being free food.
Enjoying my freedom back.

3973
03:08:22,500 --> 03:08:24,690
Oh man.
What's it like after everything is doing

3974
03:08:24,691 --> 03:08:27,450
good man.
He will tell me that he was doing comedy

3975
03:08:27,451 --> 03:08:30,340
shows in prison for the guards for 
extra,

3976
03:08:30,590 --> 03:08:32,130
extra lunch.
Electric chips,

3977
03:08:32,840 --> 03:08:33,730
Georgia.
Funny dude,

3978
03:08:33,731 --> 03:08:34,600
man.
The beast.

3979
03:08:34,840 --> 03:08:36,550
It's a funny guys.
Good joke writer too.

3980
03:08:36,551 --> 03:08:38,190
Yeah man.
Yeah,

3981
03:08:38,770 --> 03:08:40,660
yeah man.
I mean that's how joey started to,

3982
03:08:40,730 --> 03:08:43,570
you know jody has started in prison 
making people laugh.

3983
03:08:44,170 --> 03:08:46,570
They would like,
they would have something going on.

3984
03:08:46,571 --> 03:08:48,680
It would be born and they throw the 
cuban up there.

3985
03:08:48,700 --> 03:08:49,533
It's really cute.
Went up there and joe would go up there 

3986
03:08:50,321 --> 03:08:52,450
and make everybody laugh.
That's how we got started.

3987
03:08:52,451 --> 03:08:53,284
Then.
That was a big part of like what katie 

3988
03:08:54,430 --> 03:08:56,140
gave him.
The confidence when you,

3989
03:08:56,141 --> 03:08:57,690
when you started at you,
um,

3990
03:08:57,790 --> 03:08:58,623
go at it or that you go read a book or 
like a minority we're going to do when 

3991
03:09:02,411 --> 03:09:04,540
you started tandem,
how did you approach it?

3992
03:09:04,690 --> 03:09:05,523
Uh,
I just went to an open mic night and I 

3993
03:09:07,031 --> 03:09:08,170
got real lucky that,
uh,

3994
03:09:08,200 --> 03:09:10,550
was uh,
available that you could sign up.

3995
03:09:10,600 --> 03:09:13,660
Was it boston stitches?
August 27th,

3996
03:09:13,661 --> 03:09:15,910
1988.
And um,

3997
03:09:16,090 --> 03:09:16,923
you could just sign up and you could 
just go in there and put your name into 

3998
03:09:19,541 --> 03:09:22,720
the hat and you know,
they got to pick x amount of people.

3999
03:09:22,750 --> 03:09:23,583
I forget how many 20 people or Something
like that and everybody does like five 

4000
03:09:25,601 --> 03:09:27,240
minutes.
And uh,

4001
03:09:27,250 --> 03:09:30,340
I just got Lucky and went up and just 
said,

4002
03:09:30,370 --> 03:09:31,810
wow,
I think I can do this.

4003
03:09:32,130 --> 03:09:33,210
You know,
I think I did.

4004
03:09:33,380 --> 03:09:34,213
It waSn't good,
but I was definitely thinking this 

4005
03:09:35,860 --> 03:09:36,693
could,
this is a,

4006
03:09:36,820 --> 03:09:38,780
this is something that you could get 
better at.

4007
03:09:38,920 --> 03:09:40,810
You could figure it out and you could do
it.

4008
03:09:41,950 --> 03:09:44,980
But I remember thinking like,
there's no way I'm going to ever be able

4009
03:09:44,981 --> 03:09:45,814
to have a real job.
I'm just too dysfunctional way to 

4010
03:09:48,821 --> 03:09:51,460
dysfunctional.
I was way too crazy.

4011
03:09:51,640 --> 03:09:52,473
Like I had a lot of drive,
like the idea of being in an office and 

4012
03:09:56,501 --> 03:09:57,820
being trapped like that.

4013
03:09:57,820 --> 03:10:02,820
I felt like a like a caged in alley cat.
Like there's no way man.

4014
03:10:02,861 --> 03:10:05,350
I gotta get the fuck outta here.
It was more out there.

4015
03:10:05,860 --> 03:10:08,230
I just want to add,
man.

4016
03:10:08,500 --> 03:10:09,333
You know what I mean?
It might not have even been an ambItion 

4017
03:10:10,661 --> 03:10:11,494
thing as much of an intolerance thing 
wasn't that I had this grand plan for 

4018
03:10:14,951 --> 03:10:15,784
myself like I thought I deserved better 
and I'm going to be the top of this 

4019
03:10:18,160 --> 03:10:21,550
fucking kick ass.
It was that I couldn't do that.

4020
03:10:21,790 --> 03:10:24,400
I can't do it because there's something 
about milk monotonous,

4021
03:10:24,401 --> 03:10:25,234
boring shit.
My brain is screaming for new 

4022
03:10:27,191 --> 03:10:29,560
experiences.
Always does my number.

4023
03:10:29,580 --> 03:10:30,413
Like it's a good thing,
but it's also a bad thing because 

4024
03:10:32,921 --> 03:10:33,754
sometimes you just can't.
You can't construct things because you 

4025
03:10:35,801 --> 03:10:36,634
want to think about other things that 
are better and more crazy and more 

4026
03:10:38,291 --> 03:10:39,640
exciting,
more fun.

4027
03:10:40,030 --> 03:10:40,863
So it's like trying to manage that 
mindset with a regular jobs almost 

4028
03:10:44,891 --> 03:10:46,210
impossible to me.

4029
03:10:46,210 --> 03:10:47,850
I just couldn't do it.
I tried to,

4030
03:10:48,010 --> 03:10:50,320
I didn't give a fuck.
I wanted to quit done,

4031
03:10:50,321 --> 03:10:53,620
can't do this.
I felt like it was just a constant grind

4032
03:10:53,621 --> 03:10:58,150
on your skin,
just pulling your skin down and dragging

4033
03:10:58,151 --> 03:11:02,740
you into this state where you didn't 
want to exist.

4034
03:11:02,920 --> 03:11:04,180
You know,
in some people are different.

4035
03:11:04,181 --> 03:11:06,640
Some people have no problem.
They find a great job,

4036
03:11:06,730 --> 03:11:07,563
they're super happy.
They make friends with the people they 

4037
03:11:08,651 --> 03:11:09,484
work with and every day is a pleasure 
and they just get in there and they 

4038
03:11:11,771 --> 03:11:14,110
laugh and joke around.
But I'm too fucked up.

4039
03:11:14,140 --> 03:11:14,973
I can't sit still.
I have a million other things that I 

4040
03:11:16,721 --> 03:11:19,360
want to do while someone's talking to me
about some boring shit.

4041
03:11:19,540 --> 03:11:21,100
I've got like five other things I want 
to do.

4042
03:11:21,101 --> 03:11:22,480
I'm like,
I can't do this.

4043
03:11:22,481 --> 03:11:24,790
I gotta get outta here.
I can't take this.

4044
03:11:24,940 --> 03:11:26,620
So I was like,
stir crazy.

4045
03:11:26,621 --> 03:11:27,700
If I had a regular job,

4046
03:11:28,540 --> 03:11:29,373
mia,
I'm out of the rehab rehab picking 1992 

4047
03:11:34,440 --> 03:11:39,440
of the drug rehab for crack without.
Somebody asked me,

4048
03:11:40,721 --> 03:11:42,850
um,
what are your goals in life?

4049
03:11:42,900 --> 03:11:43,733
Know what do you want to do?
And no mommy did with a bunch of heroin 

4050
03:11:46,391 --> 03:11:48,880
addicts,
guys from prisoners,

4051
03:11:48,881 --> 03:11:51,880
you know,
it was a rehab and then he told to write

4052
03:11:51,881 --> 03:11:54,520
down five things.
So I never had goals before.

4053
03:11:54,521 --> 03:11:55,354
So I wrote down when to be a comedian.
I want to go to Italy to love olive 

4054
03:11:58,721 --> 03:12:00,220
garden and I want to be sober

4055
03:12:04,280 --> 03:12:05,113
clove of garlic.
Said I want to go to Mexico because I 

4056
03:12:06,971 --> 03:12:07,870
love taco bell.
How?

4057
03:12:07,871 --> 03:12:09,010
Yeah,
that's the same shit.

4058
03:12:09,040 --> 03:12:09,873
I know,
right?

4059
03:12:10,160 --> 03:12:13,150
I just want to do the whole one.
We'll do the real tour of editing,

4060
03:12:13,250 --> 03:12:16,900
legitimate plate.
So I didn't know how to go about it,

4061
03:12:16,901 --> 03:12:20,560
man.
I just went to the public library.

4062
03:12:20,920 --> 03:12:25,920
This was before social media and I 
winded with my badass gangster bald head

4063
03:12:26,410 --> 03:12:28,600
and I told the old lady that is old 
white lady.

4064
03:12:28,601 --> 03:12:30,460
Um,
I sort of listen man.

4065
03:12:30,461 --> 03:12:33,670
I don't know how to tell you this or how
to explain it to your k.

4066
03:12:35,080 --> 03:12:38,140
I want to be a comedian.
I want to do standup comedy,

4067
03:12:38,141 --> 03:12:39,850
but I wouldn't.
I don't know.

4068
03:12:40,060 --> 03:12:41,500
I don't know how to write.
I don't know how to,

4069
03:12:41,560 --> 03:12:46,090
how to put a job together.
So that she put me to the shoot,

4070
03:12:46,210 --> 03:12:48,820
she went to this big old big old 
library,

4071
03:12:49,330 --> 03:12:53,600
a glossary card with,
and then she followed comedy writing and

4072
03:12:53,601 --> 03:12:54,434
then she got me this book called um,
comedy writing step by step by gene 

4073
03:12:57,231 --> 03:12:58,064
perret.

4074
03:12:58,280 --> 03:13:00,740
Oh wow.
Did you follow it?

4075
03:13:00,860 --> 03:13:02,320
I did,
I followed it.

4076
03:13:02,360 --> 03:13:03,193
I learned that I will go back everyday 
to rent videos of lenny bruce and 

4077
03:13:08,871 --> 03:13:12,470
cassettes of george carlin for the 
library.

4078
03:13:12,471 --> 03:13:14,390
And a friend of mine when I was a little
boy,

4079
03:13:14,900 --> 03:13:18,170
he had loaned me this vhs.
And back then,

4080
03:13:18,171 --> 03:13:20,450
um,
if you fuck with a vhs tape,

4081
03:13:20,690 --> 03:13:24,200
you could make it go six hours instead 
of a three hour movie.

4082
03:13:24,640 --> 03:13:25,940
Oh yeah.
You downgrade the quality.

4083
03:13:26,450 --> 03:13:27,283
So I had like six comedy specials that I
watched and they're all hb owes it with 

4084
03:13:32,721 --> 03:13:33,554
holly mandale,
regus when you were in as little 

4085
03:13:36,770 --> 03:13:38,580
christmas sweater.
Sam kinison,

4086
03:13:38,720 --> 03:13:41,560
the young comedian show with five proud.
And I'm jeff.

4087
03:13:41,561 --> 03:13:42,060
Jeff,
what,

4088
03:13:42,060 --> 03:13:43,860
what?
Yeah,

4089
03:13:44,330 --> 03:13:46,700
ronnie with hosting and the dice melton.
That tape.

4090
03:13:48,050 --> 03:13:51,620
So I just got all that stuff and that's 
what inspired you.

4091
03:13:52,940 --> 03:13:57,940
And I will go to a library and I just 
write down like ideas when they are,

4092
03:13:58,700 --> 03:13:59,533
how old are you?

4093
03:13:59,690 --> 03:14:01,970
Twenty three,
24.

4094
03:14:02,390 --> 03:14:03,550
And you're like,
this is what I want.

4095
03:14:04,090 --> 03:14:04,923
And I day I paid 12 bucks and I went 
into the main room to watch a real show 

4096
03:14:09,450 --> 03:14:10,283
and I saw him in sia.
I saw some dude named the tod the time 

4097
03:14:14,260 --> 03:14:18,410
and I saw this old white black dude with
a fedora white hat,

4098
03:14:18,650 --> 03:14:21,110
tyree,
tyree tyree.

4099
03:14:21,260 --> 03:14:22,093
And I saw the guy that does the props.
He used to inflate his body until the 

4100
03:14:26,700 --> 03:14:30,380
elvis.
He's one of the blue color of comedy.

4101
03:14:30,680 --> 03:14:33,470
He just props.
He brings out people and I don't know,

4102
03:14:34,550 --> 03:14:36,780
it looked horace.
I saw luke torres who,

4103
03:14:36,820 --> 03:14:40,070
who was on one of the blue collar 
comedians,

4104
03:14:40,071 --> 03:14:42,470
does props.
He used to a fleet himself,

4105
03:14:42,620 --> 03:14:43,453
but he's not a,
he didn't tour with them but within the 

4106
03:14:44,480 --> 03:14:45,680
show.
Oh,

4107
03:14:45,681 --> 03:14:46,690
okay.
He used to like,

4108
03:14:46,790 --> 03:14:51,050
like put it like get an iron and burned 
himself and they hit it off and then his

4109
03:14:51,051 --> 03:14:53,370
face will be on an iron as far.

4110
03:14:53,450 --> 03:14:54,283
They don't do that anymore.
And then he had like this bit where 

4111
03:14:56,540 --> 03:14:57,373
there's like a,
he's like a football player and if 

4112
03:14:58,371 --> 03:15:01,430
people chasing them and like a fake 
football players behind.

4113
03:15:02,330 --> 03:15:03,810
Wait a minute.
Was this heat high?

4114
03:15:03,820 --> 03:15:04,970
She's high,
yes.

4115
03:15:04,971 --> 03:15:06,500
Yes.
Very funny guy.

4116
03:15:06,550 --> 03:15:08,570
Fucking hilarious.
It was a very funny guy.

4117
03:15:08,571 --> 03:15:10,580
Remember when you have to have the 
church sermon?

4118
03:15:10,640 --> 03:15:15,640
Yes to choir rather behind them and they
would move around.

4119
03:15:15,741 --> 03:15:16,574
He had like these people behind them.
He had this whole contraption that he 

4120
03:15:20,241 --> 03:15:22,490
was a really funny dude.
Yeah.

4121
03:15:22,491 --> 03:15:24,350
So that was a.
What year was that?

4122
03:15:24,390 --> 03:15:29,390
While it was like 1994 probably.
That's when I first started going there,

4123
03:15:29,511 --> 03:15:30,344
man.
Then from that I just went to the 

4124
03:15:31,701 --> 03:15:36,701
natural fudge and I met Brian Levine for
soda l berman,

4125
03:15:38,840 --> 03:15:43,840
the twins.
Crazy lineage.

4126
03:15:44,661 --> 03:15:45,494
Man.
What's so interesting art form know you 

4127
03:15:49,291 --> 03:15:50,190
get to know these really

4128
03:15:50,190 --> 03:15:53,130
bizarre people and you get to get close 
to them.

4129
03:15:53,710 --> 03:15:55,380
Very,
very.

4130
03:15:55,381 --> 03:15:56,214
A unique way to live your life as a,
as a person in a strange group of 

4131
03:16:02,020 --> 03:16:04,260
vagabonds trying to make people laugh

4132
03:16:05,350 --> 03:16:06,183
where it will hit dodger stadium.
And I used to work at a yoshinoya when 

4133
03:16:09,391 --> 03:16:10,620
hidell no,
both plain.

4134
03:16:11,120 --> 03:16:12,890
Oh wow.
That was cooking food everyday.

4135
03:16:12,900 --> 03:16:13,733
like just making japanese food.
And every time I see a comedian I will 

4136
03:16:16,981 --> 03:16:20,400
ask him for advice.
He knows I'm so young and I will talk to

4137
03:16:20,640 --> 03:16:23,610
tk carter.
Tk carter carter.

4138
03:16:23,611 --> 03:16:26,430
He was in the thing punky brewster who 
the teachers.

4139
03:16:26,930 --> 03:16:28,950
But do you remember tk carter was in the
thing?

4140
03:16:29,250 --> 03:16:31,240
He was in.
He was in a bunch of big Time movie.

4141
03:16:31,241 --> 03:16:31,991
Yeah,
back then.

4142
03:16:31,991 --> 03:16:33,750
But he was in john carpenter's the 
thing.

4143
03:16:34,800 --> 03:16:35,633
They know another woman there that was 
part of the common use stores dry with 

4144
03:16:38,791 --> 03:16:39,624
curly hair.
And she did a specialist power driggers 

4145
03:16:43,650 --> 03:16:46,130
from prison.
She did it with them.

4146
03:16:46,160 --> 03:16:47,100
Yeah.
What did she do?

4147
03:16:47,190 --> 03:16:48,350
She did stand up comedy.
Uh,

4148
03:16:48,360 --> 03:16:49,193
hit her at him.
It was her poetry guests and Anthony 

4149
03:16:52,290 --> 03:16:54,000
Michael somethinG.
Wow.

4150
03:16:54,150 --> 03:16:56,310
I forgot her name.
She's famous.

4151
03:16:56,311 --> 03:16:57,144
She's famous

4152
03:16:57,710 --> 03:17:00,020
old school.
Old school man.

4153
03:17:00,110 --> 03:17:01,520
Yeah.
Yeah.

4154
03:17:01,521 --> 03:17:03,980
it's interesting.
It's so much easier to get more inspired

4155
03:17:03,981 --> 03:17:04,814
or to get inspired rather today because 
kids could just watch all that stuff 

4156
03:17:07,881 --> 03:17:08,714
that you just brought up on youtube.
And youtube plus all the shit that's 

4157
03:17:10,790 --> 03:17:11,740
happening.
Yeah.

4158
03:17:11,870 --> 03:17:12,980
Rides,
bus rides.

4159
03:17:13,010 --> 03:17:15,950
And you can do it anytime you want.
Anytime you're anywhere,

4160
03:17:16,190 --> 03:17:17,420
you know,
you put the headphones on.

4161
03:17:17,660 --> 03:17:18,493
Bam.
I sitting there watching a comedy 

4162
03:17:19,551 --> 03:17:20,180
special.

4163
03:17:20,180 --> 03:17:21,013
Cool.
My first comedy album I listened to was 

4164
03:17:22,081 --> 03:17:24,000
bill cosby,
my brother russell,

4165
03:17:24,001 --> 03:17:29,000
whom I sleep with.
Me and my friend jackie escalera.

4166
03:17:29,040 --> 03:17:29,591
Um,
he,

4167
03:17:29,591 --> 03:17:30,424
he put it in the little fisher price 
record player and I memorized it and 

4168
03:17:35,030 --> 03:17:37,290
never up until then I never memorize 
anything.

4169
03:17:38,360 --> 03:17:39,270
It's crazy.
And then,

4170
03:17:39,271 --> 03:17:40,250
um,
which,

4171
03:17:40,340 --> 03:17:41,880
uh,
prior that niggas crazy.

4172
03:17:42,360 --> 03:17:43,193
That was a fun fucking album ever.
You could never get a tablet in the 

4173
03:17:47,511 --> 03:17:51,510
ghetto unless you call up and say five 
nigga clean white woman wears the body.

4174
03:17:53,370 --> 03:17:54,270
Simple bro.

4175
03:17:55,660 --> 03:17:57,840
And joel quick,
quick.

4176
03:17:58,080 --> 03:18:01,150
That's not good.
A broader racist jokes.

4177
03:18:01,210 --> 03:18:04,450
They're so easy.
They're so simple.

4178
03:18:04,451 --> 03:18:06,490
But eric come up with it.
Well,

4179
03:18:06,491 --> 03:18:07,324
that one,
I mean you gotta realize the world's a 

4180
03:18:08,951 --> 03:18:11,280
different place.
When richard pryor was doing that man,

4181
03:18:11,290 --> 03:18:14,080
the world was a different place.
And to be first to.

4182
03:18:14,230 --> 03:18:15,063
Well,
he was not necessarily first I think is 

4183
03:18:17,020 --> 03:18:17,853
what it is,
is there's like this progression and I 

4184
03:18:19,631 --> 03:18:20,740
think that,
you know,

4185
03:18:20,741 --> 03:18:22,390
uh,
comedians get inspired by the other ones

4186
03:18:22,391 --> 03:18:23,224
that are around them and they were 
really just starting it in the 19 

4187
03:18:24,671 --> 03:18:25,840
fifties and sixties.
Right.

4188
03:18:26,080 --> 03:18:26,913
So then there's,
lenny bruce was probably the first guy 

4189
03:18:28,181 --> 03:18:31,840
who does our style of comedy was just 
talking about things like,

4190
03:18:31,841 --> 03:18:33,000
what the fuck is this?
like,

4191
03:18:33,010 --> 03:18:34,180
what is this?
Ladies and gentlemen,

4192
03:18:34,360 --> 03:18:36,340
why isn't this happening?
Who caused this?

4193
03:18:36,341 --> 03:18:37,174
What?
Instead of just telling a bunch of 

4194
03:18:37,811 --> 03:18:38,644
jokes,
he's talking about things and point 

4195
03:18:40,241 --> 03:18:41,830
things out that happened to be funny.

4196
03:18:42,100 --> 03:18:42,933
And then richard pryor comes on after 
him and makes it way funnier because 

4197
03:18:45,971 --> 03:18:49,360
what he did was like the same of thing,
but way funnier.

4198
03:18:49,580 --> 03:18:50,413
Like richard pryor had.
There was another level of evolution 

4199
03:18:53,321 --> 03:18:57,190
that he achieved inspired off the work 
of the guys that were before him.

4200
03:18:57,191 --> 03:18:59,110
The mort sols and the,
you know,

4201
03:18:59,170 --> 03:19:04,120
those guys inspired prior and prior of 
course inspires everybody.

4202
03:19:04,121 --> 03:19:06,220
It all comeS from prior,
like in the early.

4203
03:19:06,400 --> 03:19:10,180
It's like lenny bruce is just this 
genius mind opening guy.

4204
03:19:10,181 --> 03:19:11,950
That's dealing with people that are 
asleep.

4205
03:19:12,190 --> 03:19:16,210
he's in a world of the 19 fifties and 19
sixties where people just asleep.

4206
03:19:16,480 --> 03:19:17,313
They're weird.
They're disconnected from the world 

4207
03:19:19,541 --> 03:19:21,760
around them from critical thinking.
It's like they're just,

4208
03:19:22,030 --> 03:19:25,210
they're just starting to wake up 
culturally and then boom.

4209
03:19:25,211 --> 03:19:26,044
Richard pryor takes that and turns it 
into the funny shit that anybody had 

4210
03:19:28,721 --> 03:19:33,160
ever laid my all time favorite comedians
always been richard pryor,

4211
03:19:33,190 --> 03:19:35,100
george carlin,
judith.

4212
03:19:35,590 --> 03:19:38,410
There's a lot of great ones,
male and a lot of great ones,

4213
03:19:38,500 --> 03:19:39,333
you know.
Did you get a chance to see richard 

4214
03:19:40,781 --> 03:19:42,160
jenny at all?
I did.

4215
03:19:43,180 --> 03:19:44,490
A plaTypus.
Met.

4216
03:19:44,810 --> 03:19:45,970
Yeah,
he was funny.

4217
03:19:46,430 --> 03:19:47,980
He was funny.
He doesn't get the credit.

4218
03:19:47,981 --> 03:19:49,510
He deserved it.
He was really funny,

4219
03:19:49,511 --> 03:19:50,344
man.
He had like a lot of both the vh one 

4220
03:19:52,570 --> 03:19:56,890
half hour specials and he was alive.
He was on arsenio hall many times.

4221
03:19:57,010 --> 03:19:58,360
Dude.
He was on everything.

4222
03:19:58,390 --> 03:19:59,223
Yeah,
he's done a bunch of letterman's 

4223
03:20:00,310 --> 03:20:02,680
tonight.
Shows tonight show a ton of times.

4224
03:20:03,280 --> 03:20:05,260
He was a monster also.
Um,

4225
03:20:05,850 --> 03:20:08,020
I got to,
whenever we go to dodger stadium,

4226
03:20:08,410 --> 03:20:09,243
I saw one of my,
one of my favorite comedians and I was 

4227
03:20:12,191 --> 03:20:14,140
working.
I remember joel so fucking dirty.

4228
03:20:14,141 --> 03:20:17,680
I was greasy bro.
I had fucking pieces of chicken on my,

4229
03:20:17,760 --> 03:20:20,140
on my apron.
And I saw steven,

4230
03:20:20,141 --> 03:20:21,490
right?
Oh shit.

4231
03:20:21,550 --> 03:20:23,760
He was buying a hot dog and I said,
and I was telling everybody,

4232
03:20:23,770 --> 03:20:26,410
you guys don't know who that guy is.
This kinda an oscar winner,

4233
03:20:26,411 --> 03:20:27,244
homie.
You don't know the full width bitch 

4234
03:20:29,320 --> 03:20:30,610
made.
I'm super comfortable.

4235
03:20:30,650 --> 03:20:32,560
And yeah,
he got very uncomfortable.

4236
03:20:33,050 --> 03:20:34,320
FUcking steven,
right dog,

4237
03:20:35,340 --> 03:20:36,310
right.
Don't go nowhere.

4238
03:20:36,440 --> 03:20:39,100
You're that guy.
And I went around,

4239
03:20:40,480 --> 03:20:43,040
I went around and he goes,
you're going to pay for shit.

4240
03:20:43,050 --> 03:20:43,883
Right?
And he goes down because you're gonna 

4241
03:20:44,530 --> 03:20:45,363
walk out of here.
He didn't want to shake my shake his 

4242
03:20:49,541 --> 03:20:53,020
hand and he put his hand inside of his 
hoodie.

4243
03:20:53,230 --> 03:20:55,390
Oh no,
he shook my head.

4244
03:20:55,391 --> 03:20:57,480
Was the city or no,
sorry.

4245
03:20:57,490 --> 03:20:58,540
That's all right.
Because he's,

4246
03:20:58,630 --> 03:21:00,620
he like a germaphobe,
germaphobe always.

4247
03:21:00,630 --> 03:21:03,370
He really didn't even know he didn't 
want.

4248
03:21:03,400 --> 03:21:05,530
He didn't.
He shook my hand with content.

4249
03:21:06,170 --> 03:21:07,840
It's hilarious,
dude.

4250
03:21:08,140 --> 03:21:10,270
That's hilarious.
That must have freaked them out to ago.

4251
03:21:10,420 --> 03:21:11,253
Well,

4252
03:21:14,170 --> 03:21:16,150

He's a super white guy from boston.

4253
03:21:16,210 --> 03:21:18,220
I know matt because I was like,

4254
03:21:18,340 --> 03:21:21,120
He don't go nowhere.

4255
03:21:21,190 --> 03:21:23,830
Don't invite me to places.
Start but don't go nowhere.

4256
03:21:23,831 --> 03:21:25,750
it's a real problem statement.
When he said,

4257
03:21:25,751 --> 03:21:26,780
don't go nowhere,
it's like,

4258

03:21:37,810 --> 03:21:39,220
Get the fuck out of here.
I remember.

4266
03:21:39,221 --> 03:21:42,430
Don't go nowhere.
I remember peeing next to john ritter,

4267
03:21:42,431 --> 03:21:46,010
a dodger stadium man started the song.

4268
03:21:50,500 --> 03:21:54,830
He held his feet and started walking to 
the other side of the trough.

4269
03:21:55,260 --> 03:21:57,350
Oh,
that's so funny.

4270
03:21:57,470 --> 03:21:59,150
That's so funny.
Empty,

4271
03:21:59,151 --> 03:21:59,984
empty thing.
One mexican dude standing next to you 

4272
03:22:01,750 --> 03:22:05,060
mean three's company.
You're rIdiculous.

4273
03:22:05,061 --> 03:22:08,090
And I'm the only one who recognized him.
He was wearing like a beard and shades,

4274
03:22:08,240 --> 03:22:11,450
but I know jack tripper on me.
I did an episode of news radio with that

4275
03:22:11,451 --> 03:22:12,950
dude.
He was a real nice guy.

4276
03:22:13,150 --> 03:22:14,690
It was Such a bummer.
When he died.

4277
03:22:15,340 --> 03:22:16,580
It was like,
what?

4278
03:22:17,270 --> 03:22:18,460
Hey,
that black girl in the show,

4279
03:22:18,540 --> 03:22:20,560
she was a girlfriend on the show.
She was.

4280
03:22:20,570 --> 03:22:21,770
Whose girlfriend?
Your girlfriend?

4281
03:22:21,771 --> 03:22:22,880
News radio.
No,

4282
03:22:22,881 --> 03:22:23,910
she wasn't my girlfriend.
The show.

4283
03:22:23,930 --> 03:22:26,420
I think there was thought you dated her.
That was one thing where,

4284
03:22:26,421 --> 03:22:27,410
I mean,
in real life,

4285
03:22:27,470 --> 03:22:28,303
no,
they didn't hurt to show you how to 

4286
03:22:29,160 --> 03:22:30,530
crush.
I remember that.

4287
03:22:30,531 --> 03:22:31,400
Yeah,
that's what it was.

4288
03:22:31,610 --> 03:22:34,100
I was trying in real life.
I mean it was trying.

4289
03:22:34,200 --> 03:22:35,260
Whoops.
No,

4290
03:22:35,760 --> 03:22:38,720
I was not trying to real life in the 
show.

4291
03:22:38,960 --> 03:22:39,793
My character was a supposedly trying,
but I don't think they were never 

4292
03:22:42,980 --> 03:22:45,680
successful.
It's hard to remember so long ago.

4293
03:22:45,740 --> 03:22:46,573
You know,
I was watching a clip of it the other 

4294
03:22:47,481 --> 03:22:49,430
day online.
Somebody put something up online with me

4295
03:22:49,431 --> 03:22:52,610
and phil hartman.
I literally didn't even remember it.

4296
03:22:53,000 --> 03:22:55,820
I was watching like,
it was something that wasn't even me.

4297
03:22:55,880 --> 03:22:56,990
I was like,
this is weird.

4298
03:22:57,350 --> 03:22:58,790
It's weird to watch.
You know.

4299
03:22:58,910 --> 03:23:01,370
It's weird to watch yourself when you 
know it's yourself,

4300
03:23:01,371 --> 03:23:04,610
but you have no recollection of it and 
it's from 20 years ago.

4301
03:23:04,670 --> 03:23:06,380
Sorry.
Is that really me?

4302
03:23:06,860 --> 03:23:10,210
Like what is that strange man?
You know,

4303
03:23:10,220 --> 03:23:12,560
when you look at last comic standing,
how many years ago was that?

4304
03:23:12,830 --> 03:23:14,090
Seven.
No.

4305
03:23:14,091 --> 03:23:16,250
Eight to freak you out and you go BaCk 
and watch it.

4306
03:23:16,570 --> 03:23:18,230
Yeah.
SO what happened?

4307
03:23:18,380 --> 03:23:23,380
I'm going to look at that fucking grill 
grill and now a grill.

4308
03:23:25,130 --> 03:23:27,920
My teeth.
What kind of grill iS fucked up bro?

4309
03:23:28,850 --> 03:23:30,650
Fuck you.
Fuck your teeth.

4310
03:23:30,651 --> 03:23:34,070
All were moved.
That put a lIttle nice dude.

4311
03:23:34,130 --> 03:23:38,810
So those are a manmade teeth.
Teeth that get put in my mouth.

4312
03:23:38,811 --> 03:23:39,820
Delicious.
Oh yeah.

4313
03:23:39,840 --> 03:23:44,350
Did my last teeth brother were like,
they were like separated by birth bro.

4314
03:23:44,870 --> 03:23:47,090
They fucking teeth didn't want to get 
along bro.

4315
03:23:47,600 --> 03:23:50,950
They were like four different gangs to 
get your teeth fixed like that.

4316
03:23:51,010 --> 03:23:53,680
Oh,
at first I was.

4317
03:23:53,840 --> 03:23:54,673
I waited.
I was trying to get the screw in my 

4318
03:23:56,811 --> 03:23:57,850
mouth.
Yeah,

4319
03:23:57,930 --> 03:24:00,240
putting like good fake teeth and screw 
them on.

4320
03:24:00,890 --> 03:24:04,880
But then my gov were too weak from meth 
and crack smoking.

4321
03:24:05,960 --> 03:24:07,960
So I could have spit my teeth out.
I didn't,

4322
03:24:07,961 --> 03:24:09,350
I didn't,
I didn't need them to pull them out.

4323
03:24:09,880 --> 03:24:13,250
so they just know me and they took all 
four teeth out.

4324
03:24:13,850 --> 03:24:17,600
They shaved my kids these,
I don't know what they're called.

4325
03:24:18,230 --> 03:24:21,250
and they took my teeth out.
They fund it.

4326
03:24:21,920 --> 03:24:22,753
They made a motor my mouth with four 
perfect teeth and they just glued it to 

4327
03:24:27,291 --> 03:24:28,780
my mouth.
Colluded.

4328
03:24:29,090 --> 03:24:30,890
Yeah.
So those are glued in place right now?

4329
03:24:31,360 --> 03:24:33,110
Yeah.
How long is that glue last?

4330
03:24:33,290 --> 03:24:36,860
Well to a long as I keep them good.
it just takes,

4331
03:24:36,880 --> 03:24:39,380
it just cemented.
it's permanently forever.

4332
03:24:39,410 --> 03:24:42,590
Wow.
With glue real veneers.

4333
03:24:42,600 --> 03:24:43,433
Burleigh.

4334
03:24:44,330 --> 03:24:46,260
It looks great.
You look fantastic.

4335
03:24:47,100 --> 03:24:51,360
Before ma'am,
I see what fucked up like an apple and a

4336
03:24:51,361 --> 03:24:52,500
little bit.
Three people bidding.

4337
03:24:53,280 --> 03:24:58,280
No blood flow.
Like I was like fuck bro.

4338
03:24:58,541 --> 03:25:02,130
Like people would make fun of me dark.
You floss with rope or what?

4339
03:25:02,460 --> 03:25:05,370
A bad dog.
So math is bad for your gut.

4340
03:25:05,810 --> 03:25:08,280
Bad crack is bad.
Too bad for the gms?

4341
03:25:08,550 --> 03:25:10,020
Yeah,
makes sense.

4342
03:25:10,140 --> 03:25:14,580
So you want to avoid bad t's?
Dump snored the drugs you do,

4343
03:25:15,450 --> 03:25:17,970
brush your teeth up to does nothing with
coke heads.

4344
03:25:18,230 --> 03:25:20,760
they always get jacked up teeth because 
the code gets in your mouth.

4345
03:25:21,310 --> 03:25:23,420
Still gets in there.
So yeah,

4346
03:25:24,010 --> 03:25:26,000
I it throw it.
You're coughing,

4347
03:25:27,060 --> 03:25:29,520
you guys,
you get healthy crackers.

4348
03:25:29,521 --> 03:25:32,040
I brush after every puff.
That's a good move.

4349
03:25:32,310 --> 03:25:35,740
You gotta take a swig of listerine.
