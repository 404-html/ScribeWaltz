00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,850
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:04,590
So it's a great,

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,690
it's the idea of infinite universes,

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:07,770
saddened to people.

5
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,431
You know what,

6
00:00:08,431 --> 00:00:08,761
it just,

7
00:00:08,761 --> 00:00:10,200
when something looks that big,

8
00:00:10,201 --> 00:00:11,250
it makes people depressed.

9
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:15,900
Now when you tell people like maybe
there are infinite lives that we are all

10
00:00:15,901 --> 00:00:16,590
living,

11
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:16,921
you know,

12
00:00:16,921 --> 00:00:17,970
all consecutively,

13
00:00:17,971 --> 00:00:20,130
all right next to each other and
they're all completely different.

14
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:21,210
The idea that I was like,

15
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:22,523
oh,

16
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,110
it's like I am just barely
getting through the pack.

17
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:25,731
The fact that,

18
00:00:25,731 --> 00:00:26,160
um,

19
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:26,401
you know,

20
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:30,030
living here in America on earth in 2010,

21
00:00:30,031 --> 00:00:30,864
I'm barely,

22
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,520
barely wrapping my head around that.

23
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,610
The idea that there's billions and
billions and then that we're going to Redo

24
00:00:35,611 --> 00:00:40,020
this every 15 billion years because it's
going to be a new big bang and people

25
00:00:40,021 --> 00:00:45,021
are going to eventually evolve out of
Amoebas and fish and fucking lizards and

26
00:00:45,361 --> 00:00:47,970
rabbits and monkeys and humans.

27
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:48,780
Really.

28
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,270
It just keeps going over and over and
over and over and over and over again.

29
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,730
Can I tell you my new
theory of reincarnation?

30
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,570
Yes.

31
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,690
And it's really intense because I
thought at this and it freaked me out.

32
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:58,980
It's pretty horrible.

33
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,760
So it's like the common
idea of reincarnation.

34
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:06,690
If you subscribe to the theory is
that you die and you're born again.

35
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:07,860
You go through your childhood,

36
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,930
did you grow up and then you die.

37
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,370
Maybe you get born as a cat,

38
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,420
maybe a butterfly,

39
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:12,810
right?

40
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:13,643
Maybe an Amoeba.

41
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:14,940
This is what I was thinking.

42
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,030
Cause I had a dream months
and in this dream I was a kid,

43
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,290
a little girl,

44
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,190
and my mom was rubbing my
head and I knew I was dying,

45
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:30,690
but I didn't know what that meant except
I knew it was bad and I could kind of

46
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:34,500
feel myself fading out there is this
like white sort of thing happening?

47
00:01:34,501 --> 00:01:36,090
And then I woke up out of the dream like,

48
00:01:36,091 --> 00:01:36,571
fuck,

49
00:01:36,571 --> 00:01:37,620
what is shitty dream?

50
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,660
So I was thinking like,

51
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,613
Oh fuck,

52
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,360
what if that's what reincarnation is?

53
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:43,710
What if when you die,

54
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:48,490
you know when you're driving home one
night you've had too many pot lollipops.

55
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,250
You're listening to coast to coast.

56
00:01:50,251 --> 00:01:53,040
Someone says something shocking that
makes you look away from the road.

57
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,180
You swerve off,

58
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:55,380
you slam into a tree,

59
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,543
you wake up,

60
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,170
you're here back in your house.

61
00:01:58,171 --> 00:01:58,261
Like,

62
00:01:58,261 --> 00:01:58,831
Oh fuck,

63
00:01:58,831 --> 00:01:59,730
what is shitty dream,

64
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,230
but you've really died.

65
00:02:01,231 --> 00:02:05,070
You just reincarnated again into an
ultimate reality in an alternate reality,

66
00:02:05,071 --> 00:02:06,870
so you literally can't die.

67
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,370
There's no break.

68
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,880
This just goes on forever
and ever and ever and ever.

69
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,960
No break,

70
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,130
no stopping,

71
00:02:14,131 --> 00:02:15,150
no new age.

72
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,480
Going into the light and seeing your
parents and your family and taking a,

73
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,830
going to some new age,

74
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:24,120
a cosmic spa where you get to
shake off all your shitty Karma.

75
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,290
It never stops.

76
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,970
It just keeps happening again.

77
00:02:26,971 --> 00:02:27,420
Again,

78
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,690
maybe like right now there's an earthquake
and the ceiling collapses and all of

79
00:02:30,691 --> 00:02:33,930
a sudden you're just some
daydreaming cabby and Boston like,

80
00:02:33,931 --> 00:02:34,201
wow,

81
00:02:34,201 --> 00:02:35,340
that was fucking weird.

82
00:02:35,341 --> 00:02:38,220
I was just imagining I
was a comedian in la,

83
00:02:38,221 --> 00:02:39,350
but you know what I mean?

84
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:39,491
Well,

85
00:02:39,491 --> 00:02:40,271
that's bizarre.

86
00:02:40,271 --> 00:02:41,440
You're going to change lives.

87
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,670
Snap into another role to become
the guy rides this body out.

88
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:45,881
Yeah.

89
00:02:45,881 --> 00:02:48,340
You snap it into an alternate
life with all your memories.

90
00:02:48,341 --> 00:02:48,530
Yeah.

91
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:51,800
Embedded everything already embedded
in there because it's an infinite,

92
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:52,663
it's an infinite.

93
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,001
This,

94
00:02:53,001 --> 00:02:53,834
the the,

95
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,860
it goes on forever.

96
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,980
What if your consciousness is living a
bunch of different lives simultaneously

97
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:58,910
and you just can't,

98
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,800
you can't see them.

99
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,371
It's like a,

100
00:03:00,371 --> 00:03:03,370
an office filled with cubicles and no
one's poking their head over the top of

101
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:03,761
the cubicle.

102
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:04,001
Yeah,

103
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:04,380
right.

104
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,740
We're all rolling at the same time.

105
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,230
Or like the way I thought
about it is like if you're,

106
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:09,180
if there was like some,

107
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:09,411
this,

108
00:03:09,411 --> 00:03:10,390
it sounds really crazy,

109
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:12,850
but imagine that each of your fingers,

110
00:03:12,851 --> 00:03:13,684
it sounds insane,

111
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:17,230
but imagine like each of your fingers
had their own personality and their own

112
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:19,240
like consciousness or something.

113
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:19,960
It's like,

114
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:24,010
and you could stick them through some
kind of hole where they would forget they

115
00:03:24,011 --> 00:03:26,800
were attached to your hand and they
would just think that they were their own

116
00:03:26,801 --> 00:03:27,940
individual selves.

117
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:28,571
You know what I mean?

118
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:30,280
Like maybe that's what we are.

119
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:34,330
We're just like little fingers protruding
into this dimension from some infinite

120
00:03:34,331 --> 00:03:34,900
thing,

121
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,260
but the product of protruding into
this dimension as we get instantaneous

122
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:42,700
amnesia and part of like dealing with a
shock of coming into this dimension is

123
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:45,790
we forget our true identity and
replace it with our ego structures.

124
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:46,643
Wow.

125
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:46,991
Well.

126
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:47,860
One of the things that,

127
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,353
yes,

128
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:57,030
[inaudible].
