1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:05,640
Hello Freak bitches will tell for
people who haven't seen the documentary,

2
00:00:05,641 --> 00:00:06,474
what was going on,

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:06,670
what,

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:07,170
what house?

5
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:08,850
There was a burglary call at the house.

6
00:00:08,851 --> 00:00:10,320
So we responded as patrol,

7
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:10,860
right.

8
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,420
And we checked out the place and inside
it was two young girls who were sitting

9
00:00:15,421 --> 00:00:16,720
there on the floor and this home,

10
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:17,050
you know,

11
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,570
with the door knob broken off.

12
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,800
And they said that they
were given permission by the
owner of the home to spend

13
00:00:22,801 --> 00:00:24,690
the afternoon or day here in her home.

14
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:25,071
And we'll,

15
00:00:25,071 --> 00:00:25,861
where I had asked her,

16
00:00:25,861 --> 00:00:25,960
well,

17
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,341
where did,

18
00:00:26,341 --> 00:00:27,730
where did the owner
happened to be since you,

19
00:00:27,731 --> 00:00:28,030
you know,

20
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,490
you broke the door and all it to get in.

21
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:29,881
Oh,

22
00:00:29,881 --> 00:00:30,960
she's in prison right now.

23
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:31,350
I said,

24
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:31,471
Oh,

25
00:00:31,471 --> 00:00:32,304
and for what?

26
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:33,600
And she goes,

27
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:33,751
oh,

28
00:00:33,751 --> 00:00:34,584
I think for drugs.

29
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:34,921
I said,

30
00:00:34,921 --> 00:00:35,754
Okay Mary,

31
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,583
thank you.

32
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,680
So I turned left hard and
there's a box of fucking shoes,

33
00:00:40,681 --> 00:00:41,071
piles,

34
00:00:41,071 --> 00:00:41,910
a box of shoes.

35
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,130
Like if anyone knows anything
about the drug business,

36
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,430
they spend a lot of money on their
personal shoes because what else are you

37
00:00:47,431 --> 00:00:48,181
gonna spend money on?

38
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:48,810
You know,

39
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,120
you can't build a new house in the
ghetto here that she should wasting your

40
00:00:51,121 --> 00:00:51,390
money,

41
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,620
but you could have a lot of shoes.

42
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,270
So I saw all these boxes of shoes,

43
00:00:54,271 --> 00:00:55,140
nice high heels,

44
00:00:55,141 --> 00:00:55,441
pumps,

45
00:00:55,441 --> 00:00:55,951
all this stuff.

46
00:00:55,951 --> 00:00:56,281
So I said,

47
00:00:56,281 --> 00:00:56,790
okay,

48
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:57,450
there's a girl in here,

49
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:58,590
spend a lot of money on shoes.

50
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:01,860
And the furniture looked
pretty good for the location.

51
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,560
So I opened the closet and he has a
fucking duffel bag filled with cash.

52
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:08,970
I pick up actually,

53
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,770
that's really not exactly what happened.

54
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,930
Some anticline guy went in there,

55
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:13,823
picked up the big,

56
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,611
he looks at me,

57
00:01:14,611 --> 00:01:15,061
I looked at him,

58
00:01:15,061 --> 00:01:15,271
I go,

59
00:01:15,271 --> 00:01:16,021
what are you gonna do a voucher?

60
00:01:16,021 --> 00:01:17,930
This come on and spend
all day vouchering them.

61
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:18,780
I leave it there.

62
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,003
He looks at me,

63
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:20,731
he looks at me,

64
00:01:20,731 --> 00:01:20,941
he goes,

65
00:01:20,941 --> 00:01:21,630
all right,

66
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:22,463
he puts it down.

67
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,780
I put my hand in the bag and start
stuffing the money in my pockets.

68
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,280
But I had no room.

69
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:26,971
I didn't have enough room.

70
00:01:26,971 --> 00:01:27,870
I was wearing summer clothes.

71
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:28,591
I didn't have,

72
00:01:28,591 --> 00:01:30,840
I went to uniform on with the jacket
where you can stuff everything.

73
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:32,643
So anyway,

74
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:33,211
I said,

75
00:01:33,211 --> 00:01:33,990
this is not gonna work.

76
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:34,823
It's too much money here.

77
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:35,220
You know,

78
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,030
you can't,

79
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,900
you can't draw it out of a building
with a big field with money and have the

80
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:41,460
cops see you because they're going to say,

81
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,420
we had the bed go.

82
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:42,610
Right,

83
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:43,020
right.

84
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,910
So my enemy was the cops at this point.

85
00:01:44,911 --> 00:01:45,690
So you know,

86
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,870
I found a way to circle a house for
an hour and a half and every possible

87
00:01:48,871 --> 00:01:50,320
direction you could add it.

88
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,310
And then chickie finally pulled up with
another guy that was retired from the

89
00:01:53,311 --> 00:01:54,144
jail.

90
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,240
They walked in with their dupe badges on
and the landlord lets them in and yeah,

91
00:01:59,671 --> 00:02:00,031
up there.

92
00:02:00,031 --> 00:02:00,361
That's it.

93
00:02:00,361 --> 00:02:00,571
Just,

94
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:01,171
they just left that,

95
00:02:01,171 --> 00:02:02,610
built that apartment right up there.

96
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,420
When he went in,

97
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,350
he come out with a bag.

98
00:02:04,351 --> 00:02:04,951
I've got a minute later,

99
00:02:04,951 --> 00:02:05,784
I pulled him over,

100
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:06,210
boop,

101
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:06,480
boop.

102
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,313
Pulled them over.

103
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:08,490
How are we doing?

104
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:09,323
Real good.

105
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:09,751
I go,

106
00:02:09,751 --> 00:02:10,560
what are you gonna do?

107
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,640
That's called Atlantic city.

108
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,091
I go,

109
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:12,600
great.

110
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,040
I go back to the cell from cell phone.

111
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,740
I go back to the payphone on the corner.

112
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,780
Back then we had the original call form.

113
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,070
You would drive the patrol car up on a
curb and just reach out to the fucking,

114
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:23,670
uh,

115
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:24,930
at t and t phone booths.

116
00:02:24,931 --> 00:02:27,160
So you'd sit in the patrol
car and dial the precincts,

117
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:27,931
white dial the precinct.

118
00:02:27,931 --> 00:02:28,890
It was a free call by the way.

119
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,083
He didn't have to pay for it.

120
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,313
And uh,

121
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,090
and uh,

122
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,770
they bought my wife,

123
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:35,820
it needs to be at home right now.

124
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:36,091
You know,

125
00:02:36,091 --> 00:02:37,440
one of the kids broke a toe or whatever,

126
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:37,561
you know,

127
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:38,790
whatever excuse you can come up with.

128
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:39,840
Okay,

129
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,501
no problem.

130
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:42,330
Come in and you'd take a
Louis Times called last time.

131
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,041
So,

132
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:44,250
uh,

133
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,710
I told the girl in the car I was working
with was an IED plant by the way.

134
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,613
She was,

135
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,100
she was internal affairs plants
sitting with me the whole time.

136
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:50,521
I said,

137
00:02:50,521 --> 00:02:50,821
okay,

138
00:02:50,821 --> 00:02:51,150
I says,

139
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:51,360
you know,

140
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,193
I gotta go home.

141
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:53,400
My wife just page,

142
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,270
cause had beepers back then.

143
00:02:54,271 --> 00:02:56,010
My wife just page me the
kid's sick or something.

144
00:02:56,011 --> 00:02:56,844
And uh,

145
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,940
so I went back to the precinct signed,

146
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,250
went to Atlantic city and limousine

147
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,900
and so cleaned the money.

148
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:06,280
The girl who was driving around with
you as you were going around for an hour

149
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,113
and a half was a plant.

150
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:07,320
Yes,

151
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,530
she was internal affairs comp.

152
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,010
I don't believe I ever told anybody that.

153
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,341
Okay.

154
00:03:12,341 --> 00:03:13,070
Let's see here.

155
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:18,070
National Violence Against Women Survey
found that 21.5% of men and 35.4% of

156
00:03:19,101 --> 00:03:23,100
women living with same sex partners
experience intimate partner physical.

157
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:25,011
Yeah,

158
00:03:25,011 --> 00:03:26,000
that's exactly what we're saying.

159
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:30,140
So that shows that lesbians or more
likely to be up their partners.

160
00:03:30,141 --> 00:03:35,141
Then gay men are comparable with 7.1
and 20.4% for men and women respectively

161
00:03:37,971 --> 00:03:39,950
with a history of only opposite sex.

162
00:03:39,951 --> 00:03:40,784
Cohabitation.

163
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,690
That's crazy.

164
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:46,810
So what that says is that 7.1% of women
have experienced domestic violence by

165
00:03:48,321 --> 00:03:49,070
men,

166
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:54,070
but 20.4% of men have experienced
domestic violence by women.

167
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:54,890
The good thing,

168
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:57,170
but that says to me is
that I am not alone.

169
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:57,470
Okay,

170
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,940
but that's Massachusetts.

171
00:03:58,970 --> 00:03:59,990
See that right there.

172
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,660
Massachusets is filled with monsters.

173
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,131
Drunk.

174
00:04:03,131 --> 00:04:03,964
Those women,

175
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,600
you'll fucking queen.

176
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,950
They beat your ass.

177
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,150
They're terrible people.

178
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,640
They only check that I ever had.

179
00:04:10,641 --> 00:04:11,391
Take a swing at me.

180
00:04:11,391 --> 00:04:12,860
It was a girl that I dated from Boston.

181
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:13,670
Really?

182
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,230
She took a swing at me
while I was fighting.

183
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:15,861
I was,

184
00:04:15,861 --> 00:04:18,320
I was in the middle of
competition back then like I was,

185
00:04:18,321 --> 00:04:19,160
I was taekwondo.

186
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,480
I was now was kickboxing.

187
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,260
I was fucking crazy like in this chick
took a swing at me and I watched it

188
00:04:24,261 --> 00:04:24,980
coming and I was like,

189
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:29,120
I don't even believe this is happening
and I ducked under it and I grabbed a

190
00:04:29,121 --> 00:04:29,550
hold of him.

191
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:29,781
I'm like,

192
00:04:29,781 --> 00:04:30,770
what are you doing?

193
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,820
Are you hitting me?

194
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:32,870
He's trying to hit me.

195
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,850
I those are the only time I grow ag.

196
00:04:34,851 --> 00:04:35,960
You fucking queer.

197
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,600
They're monsters.

198
00:04:38,601 --> 00:04:39,201
They drunk.

199
00:04:39,201 --> 00:04:41,690
They eating potatoes just
fucking swinging at you.

200
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,390
That's why it's Massachusetts.

201
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,110
I'll bet you look at
the rest of the country.

202
00:04:45,111 --> 00:04:46,910
It's probably totally different numbers.

203
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:47,370
No,

204
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:51,660
I don't think it's totally ever numbers
if you like to do hunts aren't fair.

205
00:04:51,661 --> 00:04:52,494
Chase,

206
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:53,820
if you like doing it,

207
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:54,420
why do you,

208
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,000
why do they have such a hard time just
saying that's what I'd like to do.

209
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,293
Well,

210
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:03,660
I spend an enormous amount of time
explaining why I like to do what I do.

211
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,433
You know,

212
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,610
why don't,

213
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,640
I would love for more of them to explain
to me what they like about it instead

214
00:05:11,641 --> 00:05:13,920
of doing it and acting like
they did something different.

215
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,850
Well,

216
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,310
the PR part of it is
the network themselves,

217
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:17,820
right?

218
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,830
The outdoor channel and
the sportsmans channel,

219
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,380
they don't allow you to show high fences.

220
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,110
That's part of their byline is right.

221
00:05:24,111 --> 00:05:26,050
I don't know if they say
don't show high fences,

222
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,330
they might not want,

223
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,220
this is coming from Ben O'brian.

224
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:29,700
Yeah,

225
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,533
so they might,

226
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,553
they might,

227
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,720
I can't say that they say don't show it.

228
00:05:33,721 --> 00:05:34,950
Or if they're saying don't do it,

229
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:36,151
I think they say,

230
00:05:36,151 --> 00:05:36,870
don't show it.

231
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,560
Don't show it.

232
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,131
Don't show it.

233
00:05:38,131 --> 00:05:40,590
Because I can't know
Jen is on that program.

234
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:41,101
Right.

235
00:05:41,101 --> 00:05:42,090
He's on those networks.

236
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,420
Right.

237
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,830
He's got a huge show on that network.

238
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,600
He hunts in his fucking yard.

239
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,111
I mean,

240
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:46,501
he's not,

241
00:05:46,501 --> 00:05:47,820
he's not on a big piece of property.

242
00:05:47,821 --> 00:05:50,670
I think he's less than 300
acres or maybe 300 acres.

243
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:51,930
That's not that much.

244
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,430
And in that 300 acres,

245
00:05:53,431 --> 00:05:54,330
it's all high fence.

246
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,780
He's got African animals,

247
00:05:55,781 --> 00:05:56,820
you've got all kinds of shit in there.

248
00:05:56,821 --> 00:06:01,821
White pig's all in this one area and
he hunts high fence almost exclusively.

249
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:04,910
And when he's hunting on the,

250
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:07,280
you know it says like spirit wild ranch.

251
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:07,550
Yeah,

252
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,480
that's his yard.

253
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:12,530
I mean he's essentially hunting has pets
if you really want to look at it that

254
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:12,780
way.

255
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,070
And He,

256
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:13,761
his house goes,

257
00:06:13,761 --> 00:06:14,720
sits in his favorite tree.

258
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:15,400
Stan,

259
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,780
it's probably got a bunch of them
all over his property but I don't,

260
00:06:17,781 --> 00:06:18,820
I don't think he's proud of,

261
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,120
I think in and of itself,

262
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,270
I don't feel there's anything wrong with
that because my brother raises sheep.

263
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,163
Right.

264
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,500
And when he goes out to get the sheep,

265
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:32,420
he goes out with a 22 he's
got you irrigated pasture,

266
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,440
he runs lambs.

267
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,730
When he goes out to get a lamb,

268
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,160
it gives a lot of the way,

269
00:06:36,161 --> 00:06:37,160
eat some of it for herself.

270
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,280
Shoes the land with the 22 however he
doesn't dress it up like he's hunting the

271
00:06:44,241 --> 00:06:45,620
lambs out on his pasture.

272
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,840
Like it's a wild animal
is kind of sneak up on.

273
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,050
No,

274
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:48,600
I mean he did.

275
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,670
He doesn't like put,

276
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:53,730
he doesn't like put a picture of him in
his 22 on in a dead lamb on Facebook.

277
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:54,603
He's like,

278
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:55,543
you know what I mean?

279
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:56,893
He's a hunter.

280
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,930
He's a very avid hunter
and never once in his life.

281
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,020
I wish she was here because I'd
like to ask them this question.

282
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:08,290
Never once in his life has he
confused the act of farming

283
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,650
organic sheet with the
act of hunting wild elk?

284
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,010
Yeah.

285
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,330
It's not confusing to him.

286
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,080
No,

287
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,190
but is it confusing?

288
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,590
Did you have a good hunting year?

289
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,960
He'd be like so far he got an elk.

290
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,780
What does Bo on national forest land,

291
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,790
he got an antelope with his bowl,

292
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,500
BLM land yard,

293
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,423
and he would never be like,

294
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,350
oh,

295
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,810
and I got 10 lamb in my yard.

296
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,490
Yeah.

297
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,300
It's just like,

298
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,133
I already did it.

299
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:43,140
It's just so weird to me that I feel
like we talked about this with dog during

300
00:07:43,361 --> 00:07:46,840
to Doug [inaudible] has to go out now
and then and kill a cattle on his farm.

301
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,800
He doesn't like get gussied up in Camo
and get like a bunch of pink accents and

302
00:07:55,191 --> 00:07:57,880
like put pink accents all
over his gun and go out

303
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,050
and go out and like shoot
the cows on his property.

304
00:08:02,051 --> 00:08:02,650
Right.

305
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:03,041
It'd be like,

306
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:03,131
no,

307
00:08:03,131 --> 00:08:04,060
I wouldn't shut my cow.

308
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:05,163
Right.

309
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,980
He wouldn't make a TV show where he's
like acting like he's hunting his cows,

310
00:08:08,981 --> 00:08:11,020
but his fence is only,

311
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:11,560
you know,

312
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,730
20 yards.

313
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:15,580
Whereas Ted Nugent's fences,

314
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,110
300 acres.

315
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:17,411
Yeah.

316
00:08:17,411 --> 00:08:18,730
I can't really speak to it cause I just,

317
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:19,900
I'd had to just go see it.

318
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:29,950
Okay.
