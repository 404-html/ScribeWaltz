1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,590
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,290
I was influenced by a tell a massively,

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,153
yeah.

4
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:07,440
Drinking too that that oh no,

5
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:08,274
I was being thing.

6
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:08,460
No,

7
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,000
I was fine.

8
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,833
I told you I came in,

9
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,970
explained that because
this is a crazy story.

10
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:13,530
You didn't say this on the podcast.

11
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,630
I have when I was in 1997,

12
00:00:15,631 --> 00:00:20,070
Rollingstone magazine wrote a six and
a half page article about me calling me

13
00:00:20,071 --> 00:00:21,690
the number one party
animal in the country.

14
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,130
It's actually gets a little weirder.

15
00:00:23,131 --> 00:00:23,510
What are you doing?

16
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:24,343
Standup act,

17
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,223
just partying.

18
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,640
I had a notorious reputation of
Florida state for being like funny,

19
00:00:29,641 --> 00:00:31,320
but being a wild party animal.

20
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:32,580
Like what kind of Shit were you doing?

21
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:33,540
Just Fun Shit.

22
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:34,374
Like uh,

23
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,010
like fun.

24
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,570
I think Wa loudest guy in the room.

25
00:00:36,571 --> 00:00:37,260
Shit.

26
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,270
You know like I remember we,

27
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,310
I used to climb up on this telephone pole
outside the bars on Tennessee street.

28
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,280
There'll be 500 people out
there and I just stand up my go.

29
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,920
Everyone shut the fuck up and listen.

30
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,780
If you want to smoke weed,

31
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,050
go to my house and the
cops are all sitting there.

32
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,580
I have tons of weed enough for everybody
and we're all gonna have a blast and

33
00:00:56,581 --> 00:00:57,270
get eye.

34
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:58,230
If you know where I live.

35
00:00:58,231 --> 00:00:58,861
You're invited.

36
00:00:58,861 --> 00:01:00,060
If you don't ask someone,

37
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:03,450
just no one tell the fucking cops and
you'd have literally 500 people just

38
00:01:03,451 --> 00:01:07,110
giggling at the idea that someone was
offering them weed in front of the cops

39
00:01:07,111 --> 00:01:07,770
face.

40
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,360
And what are the cops
saying when you did this?

41
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,770
They would laugh too.

42
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,020
Like one time for an election,

43
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:13,171
uh,

44
00:01:13,171 --> 00:01:17,220
gotten naked for this election and just
shit on a pizza box and won the election

45
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:18,601
election.

46
00:01:18,601 --> 00:01:19,200
For what?

47
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:19,861
For my fraternity.

48
00:01:19,861 --> 00:01:23,790
I just got up naked and shit on a pizza
box and then everyone who won and then I

49
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:24,300
won.

50
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,110
Did you wipe?

51
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,160
Not just shit.

52
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:26,641
I just,

53
00:01:26,641 --> 00:01:27,300
Shit.

54
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,700
I learned one very important
lesson when you go number two,

55
00:01:29,701 --> 00:01:30,660
you also go one,

56
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,330
cause I pissed all over the feet on
everyone that was sitting in can't stop it

57
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,173
when you go one,

58
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,313
two.

59
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,140
And so I won the election.

60
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:44,130
So like all these stories came out and
then rolling stones like let's do a

61
00:01:44,131 --> 00:01:44,581
fucking,

62
00:01:44,581 --> 00:01:45,720
let's do an article on him.

63
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,573
Oh my God,

64
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,431
it gets crazier.

65
00:01:47,431 --> 00:01:47,641
Ready?

66
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:50,970
Sorry for the you already for the
part that you go that you go bullshit.

67
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,440
I will never say bull shit.

68
00:01:52,441 --> 00:01:53,640
I've heard enough of your stories.

69
00:01:53,641 --> 00:01:54,510
I'm not so lost.

70
00:01:54,511 --> 00:01:55,344
So uh,

71
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,820
so Oliver stone option the rights to
my life and then from the article.

72
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,230
So then I try to stand up and I moved
to New York to start to stand ups.

73
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,280
I did it once and to in a townhouse,

74
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,140
you know we went amazing.

75
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,390
I got offer my own morning
show in Tallahassee.

76
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:09,931
Really?

77
00:02:09,931 --> 00:02:10,260
Yeah.

78
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:10,891
Oliver Stone Officer.

79
00:02:10,891 --> 00:02:11,491
The rights of my life,

80
00:02:11,491 --> 00:02:14,370
like I start doing stand up five minutes
later will Smith sees me to stand up

81
00:02:14,371 --> 00:02:16,700
and I get a deal development deal
with him like right out the gate.

82
00:02:16,701 --> 00:02:17,880
It's like bill burr style,

83
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,600
like been doing standup for no time at
all development deal based on the article

84
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:25,290
and that the fact that I could competently
do standup somewhat and then the

85
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,210
development deal falls
apart with Oliver Stone.

86
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,080
All the guys that have submitted their
scripts for Oliver Stone's movie about my

87
00:02:31,081 --> 00:02:33,480
life then get their
intellectual property back.

88
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,600
One of the guy takes his movie changes,

89
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:40,140
my name sells at the National Lampoon
and it becomes a movie Van Wilder.

90
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,120
So theoretically,

91
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:43,740
and I say this theoretically loosely,

92
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,120
I'll never be able to sue.

93
00:02:45,121 --> 00:02:45,931
I'm never would sue,

94
00:02:45,931 --> 00:02:46,764
I never would sue.

95
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,690
But I went into national lampoon and did,

96
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,980
do you remember Kevin Couch?

97
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,490
He used to have a show on
national lampoon XM radio.

98
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:54,751
And I told him,

99
00:02:54,751 --> 00:02:55,021
I said,

100
00:02:55,021 --> 00:02:56,070
bring some exact sin.

101
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,990
I've always wanted to
find out if this is true.

102
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:01,150
So then he brought some execs in and I
start telling the story just like I am

103
00:03:01,151 --> 00:03:03,190
you one of the guys fucking locks up.

104
00:03:03,191 --> 00:03:04,300
Like hold on,

105
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,163
stop right now.

106
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:05,770
What do you want?

107
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,450
What's going on here
is just like an ambush.

108
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:07,901
And I was like,

109
00:03:07,901 --> 00:03:08,021
no,

110
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,480
I just want to be able to
tell it on radio and no,

111
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:11,290
I'm not lying.

112
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,310
That's all I care about.

113
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:15,460
All I care about is the
story being like true.

114
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:15,880
Right.

115
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,270
And,

116
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,103
and he was like,

117
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:17,891
what do you want?

118
00:03:17,891 --> 00:03:19,180
Like your own radio show.

119
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:20,163
I'm like,

120
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:21,130
fine.

121
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:21,820
And then he's like,

122
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,410
we'll do a show parting
with the original band.

123
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,310
While are you happy?

124
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:24,911
And I was like,

125
00:03:24,911 --> 00:03:25,450
yeah.

126
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,350
And so then he was like,

127
00:03:26,351 --> 00:03:27,100
pretty much,

128
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:27,401
I was like,

129
00:03:27,401 --> 00:03:28,540
so I can say it's true.

130
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,580
But you were worried you
were going to sue them.

131
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,160
They were worried I was going to sue
them cause we put it must mean you have a

132
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:33,980
case.

133
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:34,100
Right?

134
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,010
Why don't you just go
fucking sue those cunts?

135
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,300
Barry Katz said to me one,

136
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:38,160
they papa,

137
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,940
you can be one of two guys.

138
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,220
You can be the guy that's
Susan doesn't work.

139
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,380
Or you can be the guy
that doesn't soon works.

140
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,250
Which millimolar?

141
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,083
Yes.

142
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:52,660
[inaudible]

143
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,593
okay.

144
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:13,403
I never knew,

145
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,560
I never knew how to start.

146
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:18,691
I don't hear anything.

147
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:18,980
Brian.
