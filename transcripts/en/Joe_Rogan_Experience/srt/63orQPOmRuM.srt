1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,620
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:02,310
Preposterous.

3
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:02,760
I said it.

4
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:03,990
I did say I can't help myself.

5
00:00:03,991 --> 00:00:05,310
You must be a Michigan guy.

6
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:06,960
He has a very prodigious vocabulary.

7
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:08,130
It's preposterous.

8
00:00:08,131 --> 00:00:09,240
Has been the word of the month.

9
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:09,751
Oh is it?

10
00:00:09,751 --> 00:00:09,871
Yeah.

11
00:00:09,871 --> 00:00:10,860
I've been blasting it out.

12
00:00:10,861 --> 00:00:12,420
Every time it comes into my stupid head,

13
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:18,240
it gets it the in a groove where you
can stop saying you got their words.

14
00:00:18,241 --> 00:00:18,781
That definitely,

15
00:00:18,781 --> 00:00:19,640
cause you remember when you saw,

16
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:25,490
every used to say was the first one
I ever heard said whatever bananas.

17
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:27,000
He's just a little whatever.

18
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,060
You were the first one that made that
inflection and it's spread all over the

19
00:00:30,061 --> 00:00:30,894
valley.

20
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,770
What ever you did,

21
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,551
you were the first one?

22
00:00:35,551 --> 00:00:35,761
Yeah,

23
00:00:35,761 --> 00:00:36,594
years ago.

24
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:41,860
[inaudible] first one I ever heard say
it and then everybody started saying it

25
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:45,660
and then he didn't say it as much.

26
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:47,491
What did I say?

27
00:00:47,491 --> 00:00:48,570
I don't understand what you're saying.

28
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,020
You know you'd be talking about like
something that would piss you off and you

29
00:00:52,021 --> 00:00:53,070
know what ever,

30
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:54,780
you know instead like the,

31
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:59,790
instead of saying whatever you made that
beat what ever and then I didn't know I

32
00:00:59,971 --> 00:01:00,804
did that.

33
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,160
I really have no idea.

34
00:01:03,161 --> 00:01:03,410
I go,

35
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:03,631
Joe,

36
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:04,620
I know you so much.

37
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:06,871
My friends,

38
00:01:06,871 --> 00:01:08,190
we've known each other a long time.

39
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:08,681
Tell me more.

40
00:01:08,681 --> 00:01:12,360
Tell me what we'd known
each other since the 90s.

41
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,300
Early now and then we met back in the
day when I was living in New York.

42
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:17,400
Sorry I'm really bad at it.

43
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,690
Caroline's or at um,

44
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:19,440
uh,

45
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,640
Amsterdam billiards wants to,

46
00:01:20,641 --> 00:01:21,990
we just ran into each other.

47
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,500
Dom Railroad can shoot a
hell of a game of pool.

48
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,343
Tell her that.

49
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:28,730
I'm going to start saying
that Joe was what ever

50
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,880
the pause that makes
it so unique and mind.

51
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,460
Pause the middle of what an average.

52
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,230
That's where all the brilliance lies.

53
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:41,250
You know it used to crack me up
when people go to me like whatever,

54
00:01:41,251 --> 00:01:41,700
like you know,

55
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,040
like think you're going to
take credit for like that.

56
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:45,390
And then it was the first one I heard.

57
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:46,800
But like people would say to me,

58
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,500
does it bother you that
the sopranos do Bada Boom,

59
00:01:49,501 --> 00:01:50,334
Bada Bang?

60
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:50,800
I go,

61
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,330
no,

62
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:51,571
they go,

63
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:52,650
but you did it before them.

64
00:01:52,651 --> 00:01:52,861
I go,

65
00:01:52,861 --> 00:01:54,900
well cause I was around
before the show started.

66
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,270
I didn't make up acting Italian.

67
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,470
I didn't make up,

68
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:59,370
forget about it,

69
00:01:59,371 --> 00:02:00,190
you know.

70
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,250
Well I was the first one
that should forget about it.

71
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,610
I had a nasty thing
happened to me last night.

72
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,150
I dropped my iPhone in my beer,

73
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,520
hold it out real fast,

74
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,900
and then I just did the
first thing I'd find out,

75
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:14,910
but I'll suck all the beer out of the
like sucking the holes like as hard as

76
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,330
that shit was coming in my mouth.

77
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,690
But then like something like
a slime thing flew mouth.

78
00:02:21,691 --> 00:02:21,901
I'm like,

79
00:02:21,901 --> 00:02:24,510
was that your wax or
what the fuck was that?

80
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,760
So I don't know if it was
orange for my half and,

81
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:27,360
and,

82
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,740
or if it was a battery,

83
00:02:28,741 --> 00:02:29,530
I,

84
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:30,920
you gotta have a vice and dude,

85
00:02:30,921 --> 00:02:31,471
just stop it.

86
00:02:31,471 --> 00:02:32,670
There was a piece of orange,

87
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,020
I was like your beer
and had simple orange.

88
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,561
I'm your,

89
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:38,990
I'm going to be your
Colombel on their swing.

90
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,123
What's wrong?

91
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,193
What's wrong with him?

92
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,410
There's anything wrong with them.

93
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,700
I've been working with his
fucking asshole for a decade.

94
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,080
He doesn't need anything wrong with him.

95
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:49,981
He thinks it's me.

96
00:02:49,981 --> 00:02:50,341
He was like,

97
00:02:50,341 --> 00:02:50,820
you know,

98
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:51,241
you just,

99
00:02:51,241 --> 00:02:52,074
you're just tense.

100
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,400
You're from the east coast.

101
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,140
You crazy with all that karate.

102
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:55,451
See,

103
00:02:55,451 --> 00:02:57,080
the interesting thing is that I,

104
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,500
the word retarded convene with shoes,

105
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:05,130
but there is something we'll do respect
to something like retard esque about you

106
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,050
look even that vacant look that he has.

107
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:08,290
Yeah,

108
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,640
it's my age difference.

109
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,713
Well it think so.

110
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:15,130
I mean everybody your age actually
got a 37 year olds are rocking it.

111
00:03:15,131 --> 00:03:15,964
Like,

112
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:16,510
yeah,

113
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,880
I'm 37 and I rock it like a 22 year old,

114
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,780
which is different.

115
00:03:19,781 --> 00:03:20,900
But that's Oscar.

116
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:21,371
You rock.

117
00:03:21,371 --> 00:03:22,204
What?

118
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,710
What do you rock?

119
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,271
I'm rocking it.

120
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:25,540
Nintendo shirt right now.

121
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:25,961
Do you think,

122
00:03:25,961 --> 00:03:29,290
I wonder if he's a Manchild what man?

123
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:30,080
Yeah.

124
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,430
Yeah.

125
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,650
A lot of them work in like
the computer industry.

126
00:03:32,651 --> 00:03:34,660
A lot of Manchild in the comic book world,

127
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:35,860
you didn't know what
your target market is.

128
00:03:35,861 --> 00:03:36,660
You get this Gig.

129
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:36,820
I mean,

130
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,541
of all the people,

131
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,400
Joe knows what the fuck
you doing over there.

132
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,500
I have ones and Zeros.

133
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,790
I understand what he's like is it is,

134
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,370
this is a contradiction in terms.

135
00:03:45,371 --> 00:03:47,620
He's like a really bright retard.

136
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:48,920
You know,

137
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,090
like,

138
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:49,960
I mean that's what I mean.

139
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,010
I don't know how else to put it.

140
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:53,630
Like my Facebook,

141
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:56,560
Modo,

142
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,470
that should be your new a
thing on your message board.

143
00:03:59,560 --> 00:03:59,920
You know,

144
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,210
he doesn't have any happiness
like a retarded kid.

145
00:04:03,211 --> 00:04:05,040
You know the joy that
they have with a smile.

146
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,163
He's pretty happy.

147
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:06,541
Pretty happy.

148
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:06,910
Go for it.

149
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,120
You hanging out with more?

150
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,050
Yeah.

151
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:09,221
Yeah.

152
00:04:09,221 --> 00:04:10,950
I always hang out with all
these porn star friends.

153
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,310
You're really fucking porn stars.

154
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:14,243
Fuck yeah,

155
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,420
the Joe Rogan experience.

156
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,610
Joe Rogan podcast.

157
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,393
Wow.

158
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,920
He's got a new fate every time.

159
00:04:25,921 --> 00:04:28,320
The kid just when you think he can't just,

160
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,470
he can't add a different flair.

161
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:31,890
This is no more flares to add.

162
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,000
Does

163
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,480
this Retardo Martha bomb over here?

164
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:41,310
I got so much good feedback calling
you or retard the cool thing to do.

165
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:41,670
Yeah.

166
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,740
That's one thing that's weird
about opening for bands.

167
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:45,530
They will tune up while you're on onstage.

168
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:45,780
Well,

169
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,700
in that level yet.

170
00:04:46,701 --> 00:04:47,830
I mean when I work with share,

171
00:04:47,831 --> 00:04:52,440
it was classy because she was the one
that there was the by far the best job I

172
00:04:52,441 --> 00:04:56,130
ever had an opening for anybody because
she knows she had a great crowd.

173
00:04:56,131 --> 00:04:59,030
She had transvestites and
mothers with the grandmothers,

174
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,910
with their grandchildren.

175
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,850
That was the audience.

176
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:01,160
Yeah.

177
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,770
ECLECTIC.

178
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,930
If you know what the security told me,

179
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:09,110
if they ever saw a single straight guy
alone this thing and he looked straight,

180
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:09,750
they would,

181
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,420
they would track him all night because no,

182
00:05:12,421 --> 00:05:14,610
no guy along goes through a Cher concert.

183
00:05:14,611 --> 00:05:15,444
If you're straight,

184
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,610
well that's a gay guy dancing and happy.

185
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,473
No problem.

186
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,660
So if someone's going to
be like a crazy stalker,

187
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,430
it's going to be a straight straight guy.

188
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:24,990
But she was fun though.

189
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:25,591
Yeah.

190
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:26,610
You enjoyed working with her,

191
00:05:26,611 --> 00:05:26,940
right?

192
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:27,181
Yeah,

193
00:05:27,181 --> 00:05:27,930
I really liked her.

194
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,130
Do you ever feel like
a friendship with her?

195
00:05:29,131 --> 00:05:29,791
Do you contact her?

196
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:30,624
I'm not anymore.

197
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:31,321
But you know she's,

198
00:05:31,321 --> 00:05:32,760
she's very isolated.

199
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:33,490
Yeah,

200
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,380
she's a good person.

201
00:05:34,381 --> 00:05:35,214
And Yeah,

202
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,273
she was like,

203
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,010
she used to ask me about the world.

204
00:05:38,011 --> 00:05:38,131
Like,

205
00:05:38,131 --> 00:05:40,890
she wasn't really in it cause
she wasn't really in it to go,

206
00:05:40,891 --> 00:05:42,140
well what's it like and you,

207
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:42,721
you know,

208
00:05:42,721 --> 00:05:45,720
she asked me about people
and one night we went to,

209
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,080
I said,

210
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,880
I talked to her in the
going out in Montreal.

211
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:48,151
I said,

212
00:05:48,151 --> 00:05:48,331
look,

213
00:05:48,331 --> 00:05:49,890
why don't you drop the outfits?

214
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,830
Stop wearing a top hat and a cane.

215
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,411
I like,

216
00:05:55,411 --> 00:05:56,460
maybe nobody will notice.

217
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,850
I can just fix her with the fucking tails,

218
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,170
the dead,

219
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,700
the dead,

220
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,920
skipping back and forth on Ridge.

221
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,290
And she is,

222
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:12,791
you know,

223
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:16,610
so we go to an ice cream place and some
like old guy go in and look with French

224
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:16,910
guy.

225
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:17,690
Hey,

226
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:20,060
aren't you a famous one?

227
00:06:20,061 --> 00:06:20,894
What's her name?

228
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,390
And that's all she had to hear it.

229
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:22,641
She goes,

230
00:06:22,641 --> 00:06:22,850
yeah,

231
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:23,690
who could ever forget all,

232
00:06:23,691 --> 00:06:24,524
what's your name?

233
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,320
So then now that validated
that she can't go out,

234
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:27,830
you know.

235
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,150
But I have one guy,

236
00:06:29,151 --> 00:06:29,551
that's it.

237
00:06:29,551 --> 00:06:29,900
Yeah.

238
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,201
Yeah.

239
00:06:30,201 --> 00:06:31,220
But we had a good time.

240
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:31,641
You know,

241
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,550
we say it was a funny thing in the casino.

242
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,100
We would meet when I like in the,

243
00:06:37,101 --> 00:06:38,000
in the arenas,

244
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,360
I would do my act,

245
00:06:39,361 --> 00:06:41,120
then they'd have a break
and then she'd come up.

246
00:06:41,121 --> 00:06:43,520
So we'd never see each other
except when she had it,

247
00:06:43,521 --> 00:06:44,450
like a team prayer.

248
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,770
And sometimes I was in that.

249
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,460
But um,

250
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,753
when,

251
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:49,340
when she's,

252
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:53,420
we would cross each other one night her
grandmother and grandfather were there

253
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,011
and she said to me,

254
00:06:55,011 --> 00:06:55,730
she goes,

255
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:58,520
you just did a Jewish joke
when my grandparents there.

256
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,360
And I said,

257
00:06:59,360 --> 00:06:59,871
and by the way,

258
00:06:59,871 --> 00:07:02,120
your answers out and your
grandfather's looking at it.

259
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,640
And she stopped the left.

260
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:06,820
Well,

261
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:11,320
it was that one video she did where she
was on like a battleship to turn back

262
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:11,631
time.

263
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:14,380
I think it was fuck could turn back time.

264
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:14,891
Joe,

265
00:07:14,891 --> 00:07:16,130
he got a little charity,

266
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,630
some sheriffs on.

267
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,140
Yeah,

268
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:21,973
me too.

269
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,620
Gypsies,

270
00:07:23,621 --> 00:07:25,210
tramps and teas.

271
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,340
I didn't like halfbreed which was happen,

272
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,223
have prayed.

273
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:30,980
But I did.

274
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,581
I loved the,

275
00:07:31,581 --> 00:07:32,600
the Bob Dylan Song.

276
00:07:32,601 --> 00:07:34,580
She covered sound Goddamn ball.

277
00:07:34,581 --> 00:07:35,840
I really want to do with baby,

278
00:07:35,841 --> 00:07:36,710
be friends with you.

279
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,270
She's run a cannon.

280
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:39,440
We get up with that hair.

281
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,333
Jesus.

282
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,180
Hey Joey,

283
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:41,631
put the,

284
00:07:41,631 --> 00:07:41,751
uh,

285
00:07:41,751 --> 00:07:42,940
the song on the net.

286
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:44,000
Uh,

287
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,833
what is it called?

288
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,310
Itunes I tube.

289
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,440
I tune are you do?

290
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:47,850
Yeah,

291
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,480
it's called a just a
disappointing further.

292
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,140
The one you played last
time you were here?

293
00:07:52,141 --> 00:07:52,400
Yeah.

294
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,233
Beautiful.

295
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,720
Well you doing any music back when
you were opening for these people?

296
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:57,951
No,

297
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,210
but I did one time,

298
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:01,640
it come out at Madison Square Garden.

299
00:08:01,641 --> 00:08:03,300
We weren't at the big room
that we were doing the,

300
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:08,120
the smallest of any 500 to the pellet
form where they used to box and she,

301
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:09,690
this is so funny about her home.

302
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,190
I the good,

303
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:15,450
the band wants me to go out and pick
playing a guitar and she was singing a

304
00:08:15,451 --> 00:08:16,010
song,

305
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:20,160
something about the something
fire wheels of fire,

306
00:08:20,161 --> 00:08:20,994
some song.

307
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:21,720
And I get,

308
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,210
I get out there and I'm playing,

309
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,260
I'm not really playing that.

310
00:08:24,261 --> 00:08:25,700
He's the guys behind the Scrim,

311
00:08:25,701 --> 00:08:28,940
the real guitar players playing his ass
off and I'm thinking like I'm planning,

312
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:29,340
she's at that,

313
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,700
I'm singing with her on the song.

314
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,420
We get down on her knees and we're like
looking at each other and singing and

315
00:08:35,421 --> 00:08:36,254
screaming.

316
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,140
And then I get off and she
never said a word about it.

317
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,100
She never said,

318
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,180
what the fuck are you doing?

319
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:42,410
That was great.

320
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:43,790
That was going to be,

321
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:45,140
and I worked with her for all those years.

322
00:08:45,141 --> 00:08:45,291
You know,

323
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,370
you'd think she would
notice this one stage.

324
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:48,841
What was it?

325
00:08:48,841 --> 00:08:49,250
Song.

326
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,083
But he's singing,

327
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,410
I forget,

328
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,470
but it was pretty lucky.

329
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,600
It was a good rock song,

330
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:54,320
you know?

331
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,870
And it would be something
gimme shelter is up.

332
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,193
Oh Wow.

333
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,101
What now?

334
00:08:59,101 --> 00:09:00,210
How many different gigs did you do?

335
00:09:00,211 --> 00:09:01,044
Whitney Houston.

336
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,311
They're just,

337
00:09:02,311 --> 00:09:04,310
the weekend was a little
long weekend and I,

338
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,480
I think I opened for her three,

339
00:09:06,481 --> 00:09:07,201
it's three nights.

340
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:08,530
And then it was like a long lake,

341
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,260
like Memorial Day or July 4th,

342
00:09:10,261 --> 00:09:11,094
something like that.

343
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,250
And then I,

344
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,071
I did a,

345
00:09:13,071 --> 00:09:13,290
uh,

346
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:14,700
my own headlines the first time.

347
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,690
My headline was on the fourth night
and I did a whole bit about her,

348
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,790
like make fun of her and,

349
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:21,960
and singing and stuff.

350
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,780
And then the crew was crying,

351
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:24,643
laughing.

352
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,030
That's hilarious.

353
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,220
And her father was such a good guy and he,

354
00:09:29,221 --> 00:09:30,720
I felt like he said to me,

355
00:09:30,721 --> 00:09:30,871
you know,

356
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:31,840
I really like you.

357
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:32,610
You're,

358
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:33,110
I said,

359
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:33,451
thanks.

360
00:09:33,451 --> 00:09:33,751
He goes,

361
00:09:33,751 --> 00:09:35,310
I'd love to get a little
break with my daughter again.

362
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:36,181
I said thank you.

363
00:09:36,181 --> 00:09:36,601
And I'm thinking,

364
00:09:36,601 --> 00:09:37,590
no fucking way.

365
00:09:37,591 --> 00:09:42,060
I'd rather be at Jimmy's clam bar and
bail afforded before they shucked the

366
00:09:42,061 --> 00:09:42,894
clams

367
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,110
have them shocking in the backyard.

368
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:48,683
But anyway,

369
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,211
it was that bad,

370
00:09:51,211 --> 00:09:52,044
Huh?

371
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,060
Yeah.

372
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:53,310
She,

373
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:53,500
you know,

374
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,070
she like,

375
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,590
I remember saying on stage,

376
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,590
cause you know,

377
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,220
then she's already doing
the prayer and look,

378
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,490
and Jesus does in his hand.

379
00:09:59,491 --> 00:09:59,551
I,

380
00:09:59,551 --> 00:09:59,791
you know,

381
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:00,041
I don't,

382
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:04,410
I don't know about a lot about religious
history and I don't think Jesus had 300

383
00:10:04,411 --> 00:10:07,020
pimp bouncers pushing old people away.

384
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:07,860
You know?

385
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,041
I mean,

386
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,090
she pushed old people away.

387
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,601
Well,

388
00:10:09,601 --> 00:10:09,961
you know,

389
00:10:09,961 --> 00:10:12,450
I'm exactly the kind of shit
that had the divas thing.

390
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:14,270
I couldn't stand for that.

391
00:10:14,271 --> 00:10:15,330
Diva Shit is weird,

392
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:15,870
right?

393
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:16,230
Yeah.

394
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:16,621
Man.

395
00:10:16,621 --> 00:10:17,760
Senior was a lightweight,

396
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,830
so that was 135 pounds.

397
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:20,970
Um,

398
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:21,900
and I think that,

399
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:22,201
uh,

400
00:10:22,201 --> 00:10:24,320
I think that fight took place
as a lightweight fighter.

401
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:28,140
Believe fought Livingstone bramble
he found a lot of great fighters.

402
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:29,323
SARC whale.

403
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,330
He came to see me at the
Improv one night and uh,

404
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,660
we went out to talk and
his wife and his kid,

405
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:39,530
we're watching a show and some guy
comes up to us and it goes boom,

406
00:10:39,531 --> 00:10:40,170
boom and seen.

407
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:41,003
He goes,

408
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,020
can I ask you something when you hit me?

409
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,100
Right?

410
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,510
And I said to the guy,

411
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:45,841
I said,

412
00:10:45,841 --> 00:10:46,200
look,

413
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,033
uh,

414
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,700
you know,

415
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,181
I said,

416
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:49,014
they can't hit you.

417
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,440
You know,

418
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,550
Raymond's really nice guy.

419
00:10:50,551 --> 00:10:51,384
Do you ever meet him?

420
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,520
I'm said hi to him downstairs with them.

421
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:55,290
You know,

422
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:55,861
Youngstown,

423
00:10:55,861 --> 00:10:56,401
Ohio,

424
00:10:56,401 --> 00:10:59,500
like real cool guy and
did it all for his father.

425
00:10:59,501 --> 00:11:00,334
A great story.

426
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:01,770
And I said,

427
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:02,131
look man,

428
00:11:02,131 --> 00:11:03,000
he can't hit you.

429
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:03,570
You know,

430
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:04,403
like Raymond's like,

431
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:05,220
he's,

432
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:05,661
and they said,

433
00:11:05,661 --> 00:11:06,030
well,

434
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:08,570
can I hit you then to rape me?

435
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:08,911
I said,

436
00:11:08,911 --> 00:11:09,031
no,

437
00:11:09,031 --> 00:11:10,130
you can't fucking pay them.

438
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,760
What are you crazy kind of hit you?

439
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:13,970
He said,

440
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:14,190
good.

441
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:14,491
He said,

442
00:11:14,491 --> 00:11:17,010
I always wanted to see what like
a professional punch felt like,

443
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,873
oh God.

444
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,550
Like the fuck I look like to
give them an amateur punch.

445
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,820
Well now he that dummy,

446
00:11:21,821 --> 00:11:24,660
the guy's got to his fucking
hands and then put gloves on.

447
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,230
Then punch.

448
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:28,710
You either break his hands course
with the force that they hit.

449
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:29,791
Yeah,

450
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:30,870
you could easily break your hand.

451
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,713
Someone's forehead.

452
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:34,560
He's lucky he didn't say it at the
Vinny Corto if any would have probably

453
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:35,394
punched him.

454
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,293
Oh God.

455
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:40,020
I did a great thing of anyone
time ever tell you this.

456
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,453
I Dunno.

457
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,133
I brought him up.

458
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,183
Okay.

459
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:48,920
We had a crazy fucking nut cocaine head
that lived upstairs and they were funny

460
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,421
today when this,

461
00:11:49,421 --> 00:11:49,680
yeah,

462
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,550
they would fuck.

463
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,760
And then you hear the shower and it was
like five in the morning and I stay up

464
00:11:54,761 --> 00:11:54,971
late.

465
00:11:54,971 --> 00:11:55,661
But after a while,

466
00:11:55,661 --> 00:11:56,770
like I said,

467
00:11:56,771 --> 00:11:58,570
the Musky turned the
music down just a little.

468
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:00,190
That's all nice.

469
00:12:00,191 --> 00:12:01,024
You know,

470
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:04,030
next day Kim's window was broken in a car.

471
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,290
I knew he fucking did it.

472
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,610
So I go get Vinny.

473
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,380
Vinny looked like a fucking,

474
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,040
you know,

475
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,110
incredibly fucking gorilla.

476
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:14,830
Just killed 100% and I get,

477
00:12:14,831 --> 00:12:15,664
I get a kick out of him.

478
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,840
And I liked the guy personally,

479
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:17,421
but,

480
00:12:17,421 --> 00:12:17,580
uh,

481
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,590
he did me a favor,

482
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:18,820
come,

483
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:19,601
we go up and was like,

484
00:12:19,601 --> 00:12:19,991
good guy,

485
00:12:19,991 --> 00:12:20,830
bad guy thing.

486
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,170
And he kicked the door and the kid goes,

487
00:12:23,171 --> 00:12:23,850
what?

488
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:24,683
And I go,

489
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,150
hey man,

490
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,560
I just want to ask any sees Vinny.

491
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:29,260
And then he changed
completely and he goes,

492
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,040
uh,

493
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,480
you know,

494
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,310
uh,

495
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,140
uh,

496
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:32,973
my cup.

497
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:36,910
I just wanted to tell you
that somebody broke a window.

498
00:12:36,911 --> 00:12:37,780
And as your neighbor,

499
00:12:37,781 --> 00:12:40,000
I want to warn you that
there's somebody around here.

500
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:41,320
So just look out for yourself.

501
00:12:41,321 --> 00:12:42,730
And I'm totally not really me.

502
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,250
And Vinnie goes,

503
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,310
my fucking cousin,

504
00:12:45,311 --> 00:12:45,581
he goes,

505
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:46,750
I love him like a brother.

506
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:47,561
He goes,

507
00:12:47,561 --> 00:12:49,690
if anybody does fucks with dom,

508
00:12:49,691 --> 00:12:51,280
I get these fucking headaches.

509
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,600
I don't even know what I'm doing.

510
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,340
And the kids going.

511
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:53,831
And the guy goes,

512
00:12:53,831 --> 00:12:54,010
oh,

513
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:54,161
no,

514
00:12:54,161 --> 00:12:54,760
no ma'am,

515
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,750
I certainly didn't do it.

516
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:56,584
And Go,

517
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,800
holy fuck accused you of doing it.

518
00:12:58,801 --> 00:12:59,890
Why would you say that?

519
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,073
And,

520
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:02,650
and he goes,

521
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:03,280
he said,

522
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,380
I sleep on his couch and the afternoon,

523
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,940
make sure there's no fucking noise.

524
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,751
I'll go fucking crate.

525
00:13:07,751 --> 00:13:08,261
And that was it.

526
00:13:08,261 --> 00:13:09,094
You know,

527
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:09,620
stop.

528
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,301
The noise stopped,

529
00:13:10,301 --> 00:13:11,080
everything,

530
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,680
stopped everything that he'd see him
at the Jimmy see Benny impressive 500

531
00:13:14,681 --> 00:13:15,670
pounds at the gym.

532
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,210
Yeah.

533
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:16,930
How you doing?

534
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:17,763
How's your cousin?

535
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:18,520
I ended,

536
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,520
the thing I realized about
myself was that I love violence,

537
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,350
but it has to be real.

538
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,180
Like I don't like violent movies than it,

539
00:13:25,181 --> 00:13:29,230
than it did it and like to see Joey
Peshy a 60 year old guy beaten up some 20

540
00:13:29,231 --> 00:13:30,064
year old kid.

541
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:31,690
No fucking bullshit.

542
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:36,130
When I was there that night
when you invited me to the
pond and I see these guys

543
00:13:36,131 --> 00:13:37,540
really getting fucking whacked and,

544
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,161
and you know,

545
00:13:38,161 --> 00:13:38,420
you,

546
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,370
we know when it really hits.

547
00:13:39,371 --> 00:13:40,570
The reality is when you sit in,

548
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:40,991
like I told you,

549
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:44,320
I was sitting behind the guy's mother
and girlfriend when he got knocked down

550
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,513
and the mother's like,

551
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,553
chew me,

552
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:47,021
you know,

553
00:13:47,021 --> 00:13:47,854
like real,

554
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,341
it's fucking,

555
00:13:48,341 --> 00:13:49,174
you know,

556
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,190
I loved the pounding they take.

557
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:52,151
Yeah,

558
00:13:52,151 --> 00:13:52,660
it's odd.

559
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,680
I can't remember the kid that Tasmanian
Devil is just ran up the thing and did

560
00:13:56,681 --> 00:13:57,580
like flips over.

561
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:01,480
Do you remember him talking about it was
kind of maybe he was like maybe Mulatto

562
00:14:01,481 --> 00:14:03,280
or maybe from an island or something.

563
00:14:03,281 --> 00:14:06,640
He's kind of a light skin black
kid and he was phenomenal.

564
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,680
He was,

565
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,790
he was leaping in the air like eight feet.

566
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:12,260
And I'm talking about y'all.

567
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:12,941
I do.

568
00:14:12,941 --> 00:14:14,560
I can't believe I don't have
his name on the top line.

569
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:14,861
Hold on.

570
00:14:14,861 --> 00:14:14,981
How,

571
00:14:14,981 --> 00:14:15,590
but he was,

572
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:19,540
it was like they spread the camera
up when you were watching him,

573
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,390
you know he was the one
that knocked the guy out.

574
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,200
Yeah,

575
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,033
I have to,

576
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:30,100
I have to find out what his name is right
now because he's fucking brilliant and

577
00:14:30,131 --> 00:14:31,450
he's an up and coming kid.

578
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,711
So just give me a,

579
00:14:32,711 --> 00:14:33,540
so while we're waiting,

580
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,290
let's talk more about supplements.

581
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,400
Hey Tom,

582
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,710
what was it like meeting
Johnny Carson with,

583
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,900
do you have any stories
of anything cool that,

584
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:41,590
that,

585
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,423
that happened?

586
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:43,960
The thing about it is,

587
00:14:43,961 --> 00:14:47,890
and that was like in 1986 so that's when
the tonight show is still really big.

588
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,150
And it was not fun.

589
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:49,751
It was a,

590
00:14:49,751 --> 00:14:51,290
it was an experience like a,

591
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:51,740
um,

592
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,180
an imprimatur of comedy.

593
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,380
It was an experience.

594
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,340
John.

595
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,090
John,

596
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:56,900
Shit,

597
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,201
sorry,

598
00:14:57,201 --> 00:14:58,310
I keep calling shiny shit.

599
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,623
Uh,

600
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,500
but Carson,

601
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,280
I,

602
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:01,820
I wanted to,

603
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:05,270
I looked in the hills in Burbank
and I wonder to run away,

604
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:09,290
I wanted to run away and start a new
life like in the hills because I was so

605
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,630
fucking afraid of going
on that stage when they,

606
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:12,690
cause Jim Mccauley,

607
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:15,350
the guy booked that comes and talks
to you and then they pull it back in.

608
00:15:15,351 --> 00:15:16,010
There it is.

609
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:16,730
John Dodson.

610
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:17,200
Sorry.

611
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,320
You know what's his name?

612
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,543
John Dodson.

613
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:20,600
That was the kid.

614
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:20,781
Yeah,

615
00:15:20,781 --> 00:15:21,560
he's amazing.

616
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,393
Oh my God.

617
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:23,440
What an athlete.

618
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,510
He moves like a cartoon
flies through the air.

619
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:26,781
Yeah.

620
00:15:26,781 --> 00:15:28,010
It's just super talented.

621
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:29,000
He was doing that flip.

622
00:15:29,001 --> 00:15:30,350
He was like right up the walls.

623
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:30,561
Yeah.

624
00:15:30,561 --> 00:15:32,030
He's incredible.

625
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,103
He's incredible.

626
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:33,951
He's a,

627
00:15:33,951 --> 00:15:34,371
yeah,

628
00:15:34,371 --> 00:15:35,690
he does like cartoonish shit.

629
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,430
It's like self,

630
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,060
like so gifted.

631
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:38,900
You know,

632
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,711
he's just got like a,

633
00:15:39,711 --> 00:15:43,640
almost like an acrobatic
ability to throw the story.

634
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:44,563
Whatever you're saying.

635
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:45,403
You were terrified.

636
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,830
Terrified to go on the stage.

637
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:53,280
The curtain go back and it's unreal that
you hear Johnny Carson laughing and Ed

638
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,920
Mcmahon rule and see,

639
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:55,731
I had done a joke,

640
00:15:55,731 --> 00:15:57,500
but at Mcmahon and when,

641
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:59,810
when I saw him backstage,

642
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,130
he pulled me towards him.

643
00:16:01,131 --> 00:16:01,400
I think,

644
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:01,521
oh,

645
00:16:01,521 --> 00:16:05,660
fucking head's going to slide me right
before I go on because he and I actually,

646
00:16:05,661 --> 00:16:07,670
I didn't know that he loved the joke,

647
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,050
but remember the joke?

648
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:09,261
Yeah,

649
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:09,451
yeah,

650
00:16:09,451 --> 00:16:09,721
yeah,

651
00:16:09,721 --> 00:16:09,891
yeah.

652
00:16:09,891 --> 00:16:10,401
It was like,

653
00:16:10,401 --> 00:16:11,000
um,

654
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,250
you call them alcohol slow.

655
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,303
What do I call?

656
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,510
I said I met Ed Mcmahon.

657
00:16:14,511 --> 00:16:14,691
He's,

658
00:16:14,691 --> 00:16:14,931
you know,

659
00:16:14,931 --> 00:16:16,760
he's been in show business for 35 years.

660
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,960
What do I go up to him and say hi Ed.

661
00:16:18,961 --> 00:16:19,940
Like call him Mister Ed.

662
00:16:19,941 --> 00:16:21,470
Mr He was the Eddie Mcmahon.

663
00:16:21,471 --> 00:16:21,870
Mr You,

664
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:22,431
big fat,

665
00:16:22,431 --> 00:16:23,141
lucky town,

666
00:16:23,141 --> 00:16:26,150
one slump kissing Johnny's
ass for the last 30 years.

667
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,670
You Budweiser's suck on an
ALP was slinging nothing.

668
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,510
What do you do?

669
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:30,733
I don't mean that in the,

670
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,910
and that was the joke.

671
00:16:31,911 --> 00:16:32,600
Right.

672
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:32,991
And you know,

673
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:33,950
not a nice joke,

674
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:34,671
but hopefully,

675
00:16:34,671 --> 00:16:34,851
you know,

676
00:16:34,851 --> 00:16:38,630
he took it in the spirit that he was a
big success and I was a new comic and

677
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:39,381
that's the way you took it,

678
00:16:39,381 --> 00:16:40,214
you know?

679
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:40,970
That's awesome.

680
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,310
I watched Johnny Carson every single day.

681
00:16:43,311 --> 00:16:47,510
I never missed it and I was a kid and
that was because there was no VCRs when I

682
00:16:47,511 --> 00:16:48,050
was a kid.

683
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,310
But I would sit there
and watch it every day.

684
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:52,700
I think I remembered you from that.

685
00:16:52,701 --> 00:16:54,980
When I first moved to La,

686
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,020
I met you at the comedy
store and I was like,

687
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:00,920
from Johnny Carson saw young Carson,

688
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,370
I saw a bunch of guys on Carson that
wouldn't have been great comedians.

689
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,530
I saw Jenny on Carson for the first time.

690
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,393
It was a great community.

691
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,740
He was a great comedian as needed.

692
00:17:09,741 --> 00:17:10,100
Right?

693
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:10,490
Yeah.

694
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:10,671
I mean,

695
00:17:10,671 --> 00:17:13,430
Carson was the thing back
when you were coming up,

696
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,450
if you got on Carson,

697
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:15,050
Holy Shit,

698
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:15,883
you fucking made it.

699
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,570
I know he would see a
guy like Richard Jenny,

700
00:17:17,571 --> 00:17:19,700
you had like 18 Carson's
or something like that.

701
00:17:19,701 --> 00:17:20,060
Yeah.

702
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:20,893
And you really got writer.

703
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,700
Brilliant.

704
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,200
And,

705
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,870
and just such a great comic and you would,

706
00:17:23,871 --> 00:17:25,070
you'd see those uh,

707
00:17:25,071 --> 00:17:26,720
those credits and you go Jesus Christ,

708
00:17:26,721 --> 00:17:28,280
like I did Carson 18 times,

709
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,420
then you would go see him.

710
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:34,280
And of course like he was at the time
when I first saw Jenny was like in the

711
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:34,281
80s,

712
00:17:34,281 --> 00:17:35,360
he was a master,

713
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,800
a master.

714
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,280
I remember just being in awe and there
was a bunch of other comedians that were

715
00:17:40,281 --> 00:17:41,030
at the uh,

716
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,200
east side comedy club member,

717
00:17:42,201 --> 00:17:43,790
east side in Long Island.

718
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:44,920
Richard Medivation.

719
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,250
Yup.

720
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,083
Richard Meyer Vini,

721
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,480
me and Kevin James.

722
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,700
We're sitting around after the show and
we're shaking her head where like God

723
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:50,911
damn,

724
00:17:50,911 --> 00:17:51,630
he's good.

725
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:52,463
God dammit.

726
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:55,770
He apparently did two different
hours on a Friday night.

727
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,480
He did two shows in eight and a 10,

728
00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:59,550
two completely different hours,

729
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:01,710
completely top to bottom.

730
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,230
And they were like,

731
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:04,290
is both of them or slaughtering?

732
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,730
He has just a destroyer running writer.

733
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:10,590
I remember feeling like what he could
take premises that you didn't think there

734
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:13,680
was anything there and you could turn
them into like one of your favorite bits.

735
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:17,160
Like you did a premise about buying a
corvette and the guy tried to talk them

736
00:18:17,161 --> 00:18:18,690
into all sorts of stuff in the corvette.

737
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,610
And I remember thinking
while he was doing this,

738
00:18:20,611 --> 00:18:21,170
wow,

739
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,770
how is this guy going to make this funny?

740
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,490
This is talking about buying an expensive
sports car and he's gonna figure out

741
00:18:26,491 --> 00:18:27,820
how to make this funny number,

742
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,830
the ref thing he did.

743
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,200
I had a bunch of great the football,

744
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:31,140
we know he,

745
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:31,951
we have problems,

746
00:18:31,951 --> 00:18:32,784
him and I,

747
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,770
and it really was because of him.

748
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,220
And I'm not saying that clearly.

749
00:18:36,221 --> 00:18:36,990
I'm sorry.

750
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:37,380
Yeah,

751
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,213
because he's dead.

752
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:38,850
No,

753
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:43,350
but what happened was we were like
getting different things at the same time.

754
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:45,200
You know each other.

755
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,120
Well he was competitive
with me and I think,

756
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:51,950
cause people pitted us against each other
purely because we were short Italians

757
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,670
while I'm a short Italian as well.

758
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,100
But you've never been nothing
but supportive and Nice,

759
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,060
tight Joseph.

760
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,500
But I mean nothing.

761
00:18:58,501 --> 00:18:59,030
You know,

762
00:18:59,030 --> 00:18:59,580
I,

763
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,510
one time I said to him,

764
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,020
because there was,

765
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:01,710
somebody was talking about,

766
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:01,921
I said,

767
00:19:01,921 --> 00:19:03,210
why don't we go out on the road together?

768
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:03,730
Oh yeah,

769
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:04,680
we'll fill up theaters.

770
00:19:04,681 --> 00:19:05,101
And he goes,

771
00:19:05,101 --> 00:19:06,090
why would I want to do that?

772
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,140
I said,

773
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:07,580
I dunno.

774
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,790
Make money to have fun.

775
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:09,241
You know,

776
00:19:09,241 --> 00:19:10,680
he didn't understand the concept.

777
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:11,550
Yeah.

778
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,510
He said to me one time,

779
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:12,751
he goes,

780
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:14,400
Montreal comedy festival.

781
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:15,690
You think I should go there?

782
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:16,500
I said,

783
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,050
go with the idea that you're
going to meet beautiful girls.

784
00:19:19,051 --> 00:19:22,380
Go to great restaurants and then if you
happen to get a deal you do but have

785
00:19:22,381 --> 00:19:22,681
fun.

786
00:19:22,681 --> 00:19:23,520
And he goes fun.

787
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,211
He looked at me like,

788
00:19:24,211 --> 00:19:24,431
what?

789
00:19:24,431 --> 00:19:25,170
What do you mean fun?

790
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:25,921
This isn't fun.

791
00:19:25,921 --> 00:19:26,754
This is,

792
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:27,750
he was tortured.

793
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:28,763
Wow.

794
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,360
He never enjoyed it,

795
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:30,810
you know?

796
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:31,800
That's the saddest part of it.

797
00:19:31,801 --> 00:19:32,070
He was,

798
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,450
he never knew how good he was there.

799
00:19:33,451 --> 00:19:34,860
He never enjoyed how good he was.

800
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,330
I first met him in Montreal.

801
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:37,170
Yeah.

802
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,220
I first met him and like,

803
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:38,401
well,

804
00:19:38,401 --> 00:19:40,110
isn't that where I met you or Yup.

805
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,183
Yup.

806
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,480
I met him and uh,

807
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:47,250
94 just so we were both passing each
other and in the front doors just said,

808
00:19:47,251 --> 00:19:47,700
hi.

809
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,061
Hey Man.

810
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:48,691
Nice to meet you,

811
00:19:48,691 --> 00:19:48,811
blah,

812
00:19:48,811 --> 00:19:48,961
blah,

813
00:19:48,961 --> 00:19:49,081
blah,

814
00:19:49,081 --> 00:19:49,231
blah,

815
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:49,800
blah.

816
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,450
Which shows you doing that kind of thing.

817
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:51,990
Just,

818
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:52,650
you know,

819
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,650
and he seemed to me like he just was a,

820
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,000
just a brilliant,

821
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:58,261
brilliant mind,

822
00:19:58,261 --> 00:19:59,094
like a pro,

823
00:19:59,210 --> 00:19:59,650
but just the,

824
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:00,080
he's,

825
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:00,880
you know,

826
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,340
and had maybe almost too much.

827
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,050
I saw him on a plane I was getting,

828
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,700
I was flying back.

829
00:20:05,701 --> 00:20:09,570
Remember they three cabins and the
American and the notice in First Class,

830
00:20:09,571 --> 00:20:10,980
and he was in coach with Lenny.

831
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:12,323
Lenny Clarke.

832
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:16,800
Nola had clerked Lynnie I forget
his Lenny Shoultz crazy lending.

833
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:17,510
Crazy lint.

834
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:17,641
No,

835
00:20:17,641 --> 00:20:18,340
not that crazy.

836
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,990
And not to one more pigs were shit late.

837
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,833
Yeah,

838
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:23,870
but what are the Lenny,

839
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:25,950
they pull out the ones friend.

840
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,833
He would know them.

841
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:27,240
Okay.

842
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:27,870
But anyway,

843
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:28,170
uh,

844
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,003
he spent,

845
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,480
I walked back to say hi,

846
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:31,411
and he goes,

847
00:20:31,411 --> 00:20:31,630
you know,

848
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:31,860
I don't,

849
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,420
I usually apply first myself,

850
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:34,680
but I'm plying him.

851
00:20:34,681 --> 00:20:35,320
I said,

852
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:35,700
okay.

853
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,533
I said,

854
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:37,623
I went,

855
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,101
it's all right.

856
00:20:38,101 --> 00:20:38,581
I didn't fly.

857
00:20:38,581 --> 00:20:40,710
ABC flew me and he
didn't like that either.

858
00:20:40,711 --> 00:20:41,041
I'm thinking,

859
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:41,541
I didn't know.

860
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:42,570
Do I that to rub it in?

861
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,220
And then I finally said to him,

862
00:20:44,221 --> 00:20:44,521
rich,

863
00:20:44,521 --> 00:20:45,354
what do you want me to do?

864
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:46,410
You want my cookie?

865
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:47,920
I'm just in first class.

866
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,180
Not a big fucking deal.

867
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:50,230
You guys are so Italian.

868
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,580
That's such an Italian.

869
00:20:51,581 --> 00:20:52,740
I fucking cool.

870
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,910
They have the good Salami over there.

871
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:58,090
Fucking Salamis get to nitrates.

872
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,301
Yeah.

873
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:02,134
It's um,

874
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,453
it's a tough,

875
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:08,560
it's a tough lesson for those guys that
are like super competitive and loaners.

876
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:12,490
It's a tough lesson as you start getting
older that none of this shit is fun if

877
00:21:12,491 --> 00:21:13,324
you don't have friends.

878
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:14,080
Yeah.

879
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,940
You know what we're talking about?

880
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:20,941
Last night we were all hanging out
is you and me Kreischer and uh,

881
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:22,690
Josh Martin and all the,

882
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:23,160
uh,

883
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,370
Jessie Mae Peluso,

884
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,960
we're all hanging out with the lab.

885
00:21:25,961 --> 00:21:26,794
She's great.

886
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,663
She's so great,

887
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:30,850
but we're all laughing and
having a great time and you know,

888
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:31,900
we're all comics,

889
00:21:31,901 --> 00:21:32,440
you know?

890
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:32,531
Yeah.

891
00:21:32,531 --> 00:21:34,360
That's what it's all
about was to be like that.

892
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:34,751
It's supposed to be,

893
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:35,201
we see each other,

894
00:21:35,201 --> 00:21:37,000
we hug each other and decided,

895
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:39,740
I remember when I went to
see the premiere of a Batman,

896
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:40,630
the very first one,

897
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,840
and Jack Nicholson was in it and he
was at the bar and just fucking drink.

898
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,440
And it's cheers where
everybody and prince was there,

899
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:48,930
this little little,

900
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:49,450
you know,

901
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:50,850
kind of faggoty prints go,

902
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:51,641
whatever you say.

903
00:21:51,641 --> 00:21:53,790
Faggoty Shit.

904
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:54,360
No,

905
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,193
but anyway,

906
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:56,921
he's sitting there,

907
00:21:56,921 --> 00:21:57,191
Joe,

908
00:21:57,191 --> 00:22:00,280
he's got two body guards sitting in
front of me sitting there and he's not,

909
00:22:00,281 --> 00:22:00,821
and I'm thinking,

910
00:22:00,821 --> 00:22:01,654
what fun is it?

911
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,310
Why don't you talk to somebody?

912
00:22:03,311 --> 00:22:04,360
It feels like royalty though.

913
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,800
I mean the guy named himself prince,

914
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:07,360
how shocking is that?

915
00:22:07,361 --> 00:22:10,900
He wants to be treated like royalty
with giant men guarding his flesh.

916
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:11,743
Right.

917
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,260
These P,

918
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,100
by the way,

919
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,680
he's got to get into my car.

920
00:22:14,681 --> 00:22:15,640
I have an idea.

921
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,440
He had some high heels on it too.

922
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,300
I guess he wrote the music for that.

923
00:22:19,301 --> 00:22:20,134
But anyway,

924
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,440
it just struck me about the
here's Nicholson easily,

925
00:22:23,441 --> 00:22:25,390
just as famous if not more than him.

926
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,220
And,

927
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,490
and he was like miserable.

928
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,350
Nicholson's all having fun.

929
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:30,370
Well,

930
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:31,820
you know the person,

931
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:33,590
you know,

932
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:38,590
I taught fourth grade and now those kids
are grown ups and that's really cool

933
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:41,480
because some of them told me it
was the best year of their lives.

934
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,100
They come to see me do stand up.

935
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:43,881
Oh,

936
00:22:43,881 --> 00:22:44,511
that's amazing.

937
00:22:44,511 --> 00:22:44,961
Very cool.

938
00:22:44,961 --> 00:22:48,080
Will you teach and what fourth grade
until you know everything but all fourth

939
00:22:48,081 --> 00:22:49,730
graders like different than science,

940
00:22:49,731 --> 00:22:50,420
everything.

941
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:50,720
I mean,

942
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:50,901
yeah,

943
00:22:50,901 --> 00:22:54,590
it's different than what you did because
you went to set people who had like an

944
00:22:54,591 --> 00:22:57,710
interest and a love for something
and when to to explore it.

945
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:58,520
You weren't,

946
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,180
you were doing,

947
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,050
but mine is different.

948
00:23:00,051 --> 00:23:00,920
They had to be there.

949
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,440
So my thing was self doubt,

950
00:23:03,441 --> 00:23:04,274
self esteem.

951
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,670
I figure I can't teach these subjects
are going to come and go in and lives,

952
00:23:07,671 --> 00:23:11,240
but teaching them self esteem and some
of the most rewarding things were like,

953
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:11,860
uh,

954
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,100
I had this one kid who was real shy.

955
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:14,030
He was so shy,

956
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,550
he was real tall and he
was embarrassed by it.

957
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,800
And he would stay in the SEL in the cloak,

958
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,611
cloak room,

959
00:23:19,611 --> 00:23:20,444
they'd call it,

960
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:21,350
you know,

961
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,900
where all the coats and
he'd just stay in there.

962
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,250
And when to come out I go sky,

963
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:27,370
it was to calm sky king because
he was a space cadet goes sky,

964
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:28,223
you got to come out.

965
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,121
He can't stay.

966
00:23:29,121 --> 00:23:30,620
I can't let a kid just sitting,

967
00:23:30,621 --> 00:23:31,390
you know.

968
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:36,390
And by the end of me just like
work in his self esteem and all.

969
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:38,240
He was in the middle of the class,

970
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:40,190
just what everybody else waving his hand.

971
00:23:40,191 --> 00:23:44,210
And his mother came up to me and she was
like really touched by it and told me

972
00:23:44,211 --> 00:23:46,430
that I changed his and then you know,

973
00:23:46,431 --> 00:23:47,540
that kind of Shit's cool.

974
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:50,480
And now I got like a couple of the
girls come to see me as she goes,

975
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,553
one of the girls goes,

976
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,330
uh,

977
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:55,160
Turner or why did you
let us do so much stuff?

978
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:55,401
You know,

979
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:56,390
like I said,

980
00:23:56,391 --> 00:23:57,890
because you were smarter than me.

981
00:23:58,490 --> 00:23:58,821
I said,

982
00:23:58,821 --> 00:23:59,270
she'd go to me.

983
00:23:59,270 --> 00:23:59,571
I said,

984
00:23:59,571 --> 00:23:59,781
look,

985
00:23:59,781 --> 00:24:00,330
you know,

986
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:01,940
I'm heading more knowledge
because I was an adult.

987
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:02,451
But you know,

988
00:24:02,451 --> 00:24:02,961
you kids,

989
00:24:02,961 --> 00:24:04,640
a lot of you have more brainpower to me.

990
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:05,360
I mean,

991
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,160
I know I wasn't dumb.

992
00:24:07,161 --> 00:24:08,930
I was smart enough to know that I was in,

993
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,460
that's why you ran the class,

994
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,421
you know what I mean?

995
00:24:11,421 --> 00:24:12,710
So you were an easy teacher.

996
00:24:12,711 --> 00:24:13,880
That's what was really easy.

997
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:15,860
I told them at the beginning of the year,

998
00:24:15,861 --> 00:24:16,101
I said,

999
00:24:16,101 --> 00:24:16,341
look,

1000
00:24:16,341 --> 00:24:18,620
I want this to be the most
fun year of your life.

1001
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,210
Only you can mess it up.

1002
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,133
I said,

1003
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,640
fucking awesome opportunity.

1004
00:24:22,641 --> 00:24:23,330
That must've been,

1005
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:23,721
I said,

1006
00:24:23,721 --> 00:24:24,830
I want to go to the gym.

1007
00:24:24,831 --> 00:24:26,300
This is one I was playing
basketball and I said,

1008
00:24:26,301 --> 00:24:27,740
I want to go to the gym more than you do.

1009
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:31,670
So the re you know we're going to
have a party every Friday afternoon.

1010
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:32,960
Well I would have,

1011
00:24:32,961 --> 00:24:36,560
we would have like kids that would do
break dancing and stuff and really?

1012
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:36,831
Yeah,

1013
00:24:36,831 --> 00:24:38,150
it was awesome.

1014
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:38,960
It was great.

1015
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,510
Did you ever try to
pitch that as a sitcom?

1016
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,261
A No,

1017
00:24:42,261 --> 00:24:45,940
but somebody else had an idea for a couple
of times with it would be hilarious.

1018
00:24:45,941 --> 00:24:47,390
[inaudible] it seems like a natural,

1019
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:48,020
yeah.

1020
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:48,920
You as a,

1021
00:24:48,921 --> 00:24:51,590
as a a funny teacher
because you really did it.

1022
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:54,350
It's legit and if you really
stop and think about it,

1023
00:24:54,351 --> 00:24:58,000
that would be like for a kid that's like
one of the greatest rolls of the dice a

1024
00:24:58,001 --> 00:24:59,660
kid can get for their
fourth grade teacher.

1025
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:00,420
Yeah.

1026
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,340
Edit girl up tower.

1027
00:25:01,341 --> 00:25:01,611

1028
00:25:01,611 --> 00:25:02,720
For your fourth grade teacher.

1029
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,040
She still calls me Mister I,

1030
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:05,450
she's 26 years old.

1031
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:05,900
All right.

1032
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,690
26 27 whatever.

1033
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:10,430
And then she calls me
mister I rarer right.

1034
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:11,160
And I go,

1035
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:11,330

00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:11,811

1041

me dumb cause I just can't call you the

1042
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,170
and that funny like she's got,

1043
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,820
he's got me down as Mr. I rare.

1044
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:23,683
That's good.

1045
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:25,760

being a dirty birds.

00:25:28,311 --> 00:25:28,670
Dot.

1051
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,260
You notice that she's a little girl.

1052
00:25:30,261 --> 00:25:30,740
Let him talk.

1053
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,071

1054
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,930

establish boundaries.

1055
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:33,501
