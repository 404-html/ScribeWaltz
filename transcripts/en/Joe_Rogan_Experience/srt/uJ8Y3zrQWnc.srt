Episode of the Joe Rogan experience
podcast is brought to you by Squarespace.

3

website for you or your business.

00:00:22,261 --> 00:00:26,550
It's simple drag and drop interface. It's
just like if you can, you know, send a,

13
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,650

14
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:50,280
Very easy to start selling
shit online with Squarespace.

15
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,150
It's everything that everyone
has always wanted in like the,

16
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,530
the ease of use in creating a website but
literally never existed before. It was,

17
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,070
I hate people that correct you when
you use the term literally, Fuck Ugh,

18
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,640
you they've used,
you know,

19
00:01:05,641 --> 00:01:09,300
they've literally now has that
term is in the dictionary.

20
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,880
Like it's not just figuratively,
like literally if you look up,

21
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:16,830
the definition of literally has changed
in the actual fucking dictionary.

22
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:21,090
So when people correct you and say,
actually it's not literally you go,

23
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,740
actually you need to update your fucking
dictionary bitch, because we won.

24
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,730

take you to do? Like one second. Exactly.

34
00:02:07,201 --> 00:02:11,370
That's my new logo. It's a, an
elk and it says eat dick. Yo,

35
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:16,170
I'm not sure about the bottom part,
but everything else, everything else,

36
00:02:16,171 --> 00:02:17,670
I'm fucking,
I'm on a board.

37
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,690
Son were also brought to you by
[inaudible] Dot Com that's o. N N.

38
00:02:21,691 --> 00:02:26,490
I t if you have never been to on it
before on it is a human optimization

39
00:02:26,491 --> 00:02:30,150
website. We basically sell shit that makes
your body and your brain work better,

40
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:34,490
whether it's strength and conditioning
equipment like battle ropes and kettle

41
00:02:34,491 --> 00:02:39,390
bells, weight vest, ab wheels, uh,
medicine balls, things along those lines,

42
00:02:39,391 --> 00:02:44,130
things for functional strength or a,
whether it's foods like the new,

43
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:46,380
more your bar that we
just started selling. Uh,

44
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,480
it's by the same folks
that made the Tonka bar.

45
00:02:48,481 --> 00:02:53,481
And what it is is an ancient
native American recipe for
a Buffalo Jerky bar that

46
00:02:56,071 --> 00:03:00,280
is very healthy. Like it has no
antibiotics, no hormones, gluten

47
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,990
free, no nitrates, no artificial
flavors, no artificial colors.

48
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,730
And you get 14 grams of
protein in every serving,

49
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:15,250
four grams of fat in every serving. Um,
there's, and there's nothing bad in it.

50
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:18,970
Like there's, there's no nitrates,
no soy, no MSG, isn't it?

51
00:03:18,971 --> 00:03:20,470
What nitrate where it makes
your Dick hard though.

52
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,010
I think that's nitric oxide son.
You should not be a chemist.

53
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:29,050
I take a drug record,
Joe Rogan, beautiful.

54
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:33,550
I think that with my pro gain and my
other stuff that kicked my hair in

55
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:36,970
anyway on a.com,

56
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,080
use the codeword Rogan and you'll
save 10% off any and all supplements.

57
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:45,250
The controversial supplements like
I'm shroom tech, sport, new mood.

58
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:50,590
What these are essentially if you go to
any of those, uh, various, um, uh, items,

59
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,420
any of the various things that we sell,

60
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,590
there's a lot of science behind all of
the stuff. There's a research button,

61
00:03:56,591 --> 00:04:00,370
you click on it, you can find all
the research that's behind. I'm on.

62
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:02,380
It's supplements,
whether it's Alpha brain,

63
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,980
which we've actually run our
own clinical trial results.

64
00:04:05,981 --> 00:04:09,280
And those are also posted
online. Um, uh, there were,

65
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:13,930
it was a double blind placebo trial on
the efficacy of Alpha brain and it got

66
00:04:13,931 --> 00:04:16,810
positive results. And we're in
the middle of a second trial now,

67
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,970
which is much larger and
much more extensive. I should
also point out that the,

68
00:04:20,971 --> 00:04:25,690
the trial, the, the positive results were
exactly half of the dose that I take.

69
00:04:25,691 --> 00:04:26,620
It's two pills.

70
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:31,240
I take four of these bitches crazy because
some love renegade I can't be fucked

71
00:04:31,241 --> 00:04:35,330
with. Is this girth of your chart charro
going to be more a bigger dose? Um,

72
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,760
no it's not. No. The, the two
pill dose is the recommended dose.

73
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:42,910
It did it help you thinking you
might have seen it helps your memory.

74
00:04:42,911 --> 00:04:45,440
It helps a clinically proven so far.
Uh Huh.

75
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,600
That's the weird thing
about memory though.

76
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:49,360
I never know where the mine's going
because I've forgotten the things that I

77
00:04:49,361 --> 00:04:51,940
can't remember. That's true.
I think I remember everything,

78
00:04:51,941 --> 00:04:53,250
but obviously I don't know
what I've forgotten. Yeah.

79
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,810
It's whether or not you're
trying to pull it up.

80
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,870
I'll give you some Alpha brand and you
run your own Jim Jefferies clinical trial.

81
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,510
Yeah, man Rogan Doc. Oh. Anyway,

82
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:05,220

83

go fuck yourself. Jim Jeffries is here.

84
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,700
While I fuck around and play games.

85
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:15,860
Just good to the podcast.

86
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:24,220
Well, good experience. Try by
day Joe Rogan podcast all day.

87
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,740
Nick Diaz.

88
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:32,740
Yeah. Uh, so that never leaves. That will
stay on. You had a question about Elvis

89
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,220
because these are all mug shots
you've got on your wall here and you,

90
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,840
you've got an Elvis mug shot there.

91
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,740
I wear a tee shirt often
with the Sinatra mugshot.

92
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:43,600
Ah, I got that one. I have it framed
in my house. Let's just go on.

93
00:05:43,601 --> 00:05:48,490
What was he done for there? It was
um, uh, what is the word tree? No,

94
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:53,380
it wasn't adultery. It was so what?
Three shagging the guy's wife?

95
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:57,310
Yes. It was shagging the guy's wife,
but the word that they use seduction.

96
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,040
That's the word

97
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,700
that it says on the actual monk sheet.
That's what I hate. That photo of Sinatra,

98
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:02,600
that mag shot,

99
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:06,350
he looks better there than I've ever
looked in any photo in my life where

100
00:06:06,351 --> 00:06:10,250
professionals have taken it and they've
taken a thousand photos and still look

101
00:06:10,251 --> 00:06:14,780
like shit. Well, did you notice how
little he was? Yeah, the mugshot photo,

102
00:06:14,781 --> 00:06:16,910
I think it says 125 pounds.

103
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:21,000
You won 25 or one 39 the
only a slight fellow,

104
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,050
but also we've been talking about,
obviously we go in, Elvis was at the end,

105
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:28,100
he was fat. I was fat.
He was like 220 pounds.

106
00:06:28,101 --> 00:06:30,460
I'm like sitting at a cruisy today,

107
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:34,050
11 at the moment. And you
know what I mean? I go down,

108
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,700
I go down up to about two 15 I
go down to about one 95 and I,

109
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,910
I go through that spectrum my whole life.
Right.

110
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:44,540
But Elvis was by today's standards,
just eh, it was all right.

111
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,390
Yeah. See, that's what I look like now.

112
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,300
That's at the very end.

113
00:06:49,301 --> 00:06:53,950
He was anywhere between two 20 and
two 30 but what was the two 30 well,

114
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,050
he was probably shorter than me.
I'm six foot one,

115
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:00,460
so I get a little bit of leeway.
He's probably, what, five 10 Elvis?

116
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:04,660
How tall was five was Elvis.
God Damn, he got fat. Does that.

117
00:07:04,661 --> 00:07:08,740
But he was dead like a year later.
Yeah, he was on his way out. He died.

118
00:07:08,741 --> 00:07:11,860
And my sister's birthday.
I'll never forget. Really.

119
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,930
He died the year I was born.

120
00:07:13,931 --> 00:07:17,410
I always liked the fact that I was
alive and John Lennon and Elvis Presley,

121
00:07:17,411 --> 00:07:22,370
we were alive. Apparently the picture
was taken just for fun, all the,

122
00:07:22,371 --> 00:07:24,290
all the magnets. So he never
went to prison for any of them.

123
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:28,180
Elvis was a law enforcement nut and
the picture was taken just for fun.

124
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:32,830
That's according to one site on the
Internet because that could have been when

125
00:07:32,831 --> 00:07:35,830
he went to visit the FBI and we've
visited Nixon and all that type of stuff

126
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:40,300
because he was there. He was there. He
visited Nixon for the war against drugs.

127
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:45,620
Yeah. It's hilarious. That bends
the beetle. Bailey's Beatles, eh,

128
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,470
they're all doing drugs and we've got
to stop that. We're going to start it.

129
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,600
We're going to stop on my own.
He was apparently arrested, uh,

130
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:56,740
in the 1950s for speeding. Yeah,
but that was before he made it.

131
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,420
Well,
when did he make it?

132
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:03,350
Uh, 1954, I think four would
have been around that era.

133
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,243
Sun Records.

134
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,260
Well, that would be him then. That
was be like right as he made it.

135
00:08:07,261 --> 00:08:10,680
He was speeding. Yeah. But he's not
like early twenties taken hockey,

136
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,220
10 year old speeding in the car.
We all got those.

137
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,960
I remember the first time
I got caught speeding,

138
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:18,890
I was 16 and I just didn't have the money.

139
00:08:18,891 --> 00:08:21,660
So I thought if I broke down in tears,
the copper,

140
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,610
no, of course just fucking
funny. And the worst thing is

141
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:34,140
my brother is a cop and uh,

142
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:38,530
he reported it to my brother and then
my brother tease me in the near future.

143
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,080
Well probably they used to do awful
things as, as a couple of my brother,

144
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:44,100
my brother's named Danny Nugen
on, I think that's a bad, this,

145
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:48,570
he's a member of the rod squad
now. And uh, I got, I got,

146
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,430
I was driving home and it's sa at 17,

147
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:53,860
which is still not the legal
age to drink in Australia.

148
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,200
And I'm driving home and I had two beers
now it would have been under the limit,

149
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,740
but still, I'm not even allowed to have
two BZ me because I'm 17. Right, right.

150
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:05,250
I get pulled up, I get breathalyzed the
guard guys, please bring in the tube.

151
00:09:05,251 --> 00:09:08,480
And I said, my brother was a
sergeant at that stage and I was like

152
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,210
go, you know, uh, Denny Nugent,
you know, done. He Nugent,

153
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:14,740
you know is right and let you guys
know I never heard of him. Right.

154
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:18,980
So you guys off to his vehicle
is there for like 15 minutes.

155
00:09:18,981 --> 00:09:23,450
I'm just sitting in the
car, just panicking now he
comes back out and he goes,

156
00:09:23,451 --> 00:09:25,160
step out of the vehicle.
I was, you're a problem.

157
00:09:25,161 --> 00:09:28,070
Anything over just step out of the
vehicle right now as I step out,

158
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,780
he cuffs me and smacks me onto
the bonnet of the car. Right?

159
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:37,810
And I thought, oh Jesus Christ,
oh fuck, fuck, fuck. Like this.

160
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,540
Right.
And then I'll get my brother laugh

161
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,210
finger on the radio. Like he's actually
gone back to his car, radio the station,

162
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,650
talk to my brother and he said,
it's going to be shit out of him.

163
00:09:46,651 --> 00:09:47,484
You know what I mean?

164
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:51,570
Am because it's cops and they're going,
I was just joking with you.

165
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:55,020
I'm wiping tears away from ours. Look
good job guys. Well done. Thanks for that.

166
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:57,990
I bet.
You know,

167
00:09:57,991 --> 00:10:02,360
I still have one more line of defense
and it's mum went and told mom on him and

168
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,650
when I go,
what does your mom do?

169
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,331
Well,

170
00:10:05,331 --> 00:10:08,720
my mom was still angry because I shouldn't
have been drinking to begin with and

171
00:10:08,721 --> 00:10:11,950
Blah, blah blah. But I still
got in trouble for that.
But yeah, it's, it's, uh,

172
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:17,570
now he's like, he's in the swat team, so
he's like the guy who, you know, if I can,

173
00:10:17,571 --> 00:10:20,750
where's the helmets and swings in,
in the machine gun on top of Jesus Christ.

174
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:25,040
And the thing is, for the longest
time my parents were so like, oh,

175
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,800
your brother's a cop was like,

176
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:29,720
like the most upstanding job
you could have in our family.

177
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,990
And so my brother became a weapons
training before he's in a sweat. Same.

178
00:10:32,991 --> 00:10:35,720
So he would learn different holds
and restraints and stuff like that.

179
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,480
There was many a Christmas where
I was staying there. And then,

180
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,760
then my brother goes a, we've, uh, we've
been traveling over to America with,

181
00:10:41,761 --> 00:10:45,010
learned some new holds from
the American cops. And, uh,

182
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:48,460
we look one where we can
basically restrain the person
until the whole shoulder

183
00:10:48,461 --> 00:10:52,460
goes numb and they kind of like,
well, some guys do it on Jim. No, no,

184
00:10:52,461 --> 00:10:55,630
I don't want you to fucking do it.
Why are you doing this to me? Right.

185
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,990
Then he comes up and grabs like,
I just don't touch me.

186
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,420
You guys see how he's resisting them?
See how he's resisting.

187
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,920
Always end with me with my
fucking head and the Chevy.

188
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,700
He shagged Paul just got crying
again. [inaudible] mom, man,

189
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:11,040
your mom sold you down the river.
I would think that moms,

190
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:14,760
the last thing they would see want to
see is one son torturing the other side.

191
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:19,150
And uh, she, because my father wasn't
much of a physical disciplinarian,

192
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:23,710
my mother was very keen on
using my oldest brother as,

193
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:26,230
as the muscle when we got too big.
Ah,

194
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:29,050
how old is your oldest brother is
probably seven years older than me. Oh,

195
00:11:29,051 --> 00:11:31,840
that's a big gap. And then I have another
brother, he's five years older than me.

196
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:32,920
Oh Jeez.

197
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:37,720
And I was meant to be a girl because
my mum desperately wanted to have it.

198
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,450
I have a baby girl so
she gave it one more go.

199
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:43,990
And then when I didn't
come out of baby girl,

200
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:48,820
she didn't unwrap the blanket for the
first four days. After the first month,

201
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:51,340
she never unwrap up the blanket cause
she didn't want to see my genitalia and

202
00:11:51,341 --> 00:11:54,490
she didn't hold me for
the first four days. Whoa.

203
00:11:54,491 --> 00:11:58,030
She went into science depressant over
having another boy and then she got really

204
00:11:58,031 --> 00:12:00,460
passionate about
collecting porcelain dolls.

205
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,130
So there was four main living
in a house and his house,

206
00:12:03,131 --> 00:12:05,500
it was just filled with
fucking creepy dolls.

207
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:08,140
I remember in the old days when you could
put something on top of your TV that

208
00:12:08,141 --> 00:12:09,970
was sort of a joy.
Like you go go karting,

209
00:12:09,971 --> 00:12:11,710
you'd beat your brother and
you had the first trophy.

210
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:15,370
So for a week he'd put that on top of the
TV because you know he'd constantly be

211
00:12:15,371 --> 00:12:18,250
looking at it. When niggle is shit
out of me, those days are gone. Right.

212
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:21,510
But my mother would always have like a
different porcelain doll. Maybe like a,

213
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:26,320
I could porcelain clown juggling one of
those little statuettes Oh, something.

214
00:12:26,321 --> 00:12:27,670
Something very upsetting.

215
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:31,120
We'd always be looking at you whilst you
were trying to enjoy a Betamax version

216
00:12:31,121 --> 00:12:35,710
of star wars. When did you find out about
the not being held? She, she told me,

217
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:40,120
she tells me all the time that she always
wanted to have a go so she didn't even

218
00:12:40,121 --> 00:12:43,960
have a boy's name ready to go.
Like she was just,

219
00:12:43,961 --> 00:12:45,320
and you didn't want to
have the ultrasound.

220
00:12:45,321 --> 00:12:48,670
She didn't want to know it wasn't going
to have fuck is wrong with people when

221
00:12:48,671 --> 00:12:52,930
it comes to wanting the gender so badly
that they get upset and the thing is my

222
00:12:52,931 --> 00:12:56,620
mom, it's not like she's a super feminine
woman where she would have been like,

223
00:12:56,621 --> 00:12:58,660
it might be like I'm
not a good looking guy,

224
00:12:58,661 --> 00:13:01,240
but my parents wouldn't have made
her know, renders looking woman.

225
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:07,020
Like it would have been just a chinless
pile thing just just with thin wispy

226
00:13:07,211 --> 00:13:10,000
hair. It wouldn't have been
a good look and go, boy,

227
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:14,720
boy is the best thing they could
have hoped for with the fucking piss.

228
00:13:14,721 --> 00:13:18,110
That's been pissed into my Jean Paul
already from the different sites.

229
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,130
I've got a great story about, but
women don't see that. I've got a, yeah,

230
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,980
of course they then if you're a
woman and you're surrounded by men,

231
00:13:23,981 --> 00:13:27,160
I think it might be my mother. My mother
is 300 pounds and she thought she,

232
00:13:27,161 --> 00:13:29,650
I don't know if whether the
intention was to make a hot chick.

233
00:13:29,651 --> 00:13:34,150
I don't know if that was what she does.
She does want it to Mike ago.

234
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:38,230
But I got a story that I don't want to
tell because in front of my girlfriend

235
00:13:38,231 --> 00:13:41,170
because it will upset her because I would
make my life a bit harder and I don't

236
00:13:41,171 --> 00:13:43,770
want to tell it on, on any tonight shows
or anything. So I'll tell her here.

237
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,270
But I just did a Zombie
movie in Australia,

238
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:50,080
which isn't anything to do with story,
but they're always in Australia. And so,

239
00:13:50,081 --> 00:13:52,330
I mean it's dry and my parents
drive to Canberra where we are,

240
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,600
where we're at on the weekend to
spend a day with me. It's fair enough.

241
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,130
I see my parents and in
six months or something,

242
00:13:57,131 --> 00:13:59,260
so I'm spending time with my mom and dad.

243
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:04,410
Now back in the early nineties my father
was getting closer to retirement and

244
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:08,320
then he found a credit card bill because
my mother took care of the money fan

245
00:14:08,321 --> 00:14:12,130
out that she'd run up
$90,000 worth of bills,

246
00:14:12,131 --> 00:14:15,260
which made my dad had to work an extra
sort of eight years past retirement.

247
00:14:15,261 --> 00:14:17,710
The Pi, these all often, she'd
kept it all secret. All right,

248
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,960
so now my parents have got to retirement,

249
00:14:19,961 --> 00:14:23,020
they own the house and they just get a
pension of like Australian government

250
00:14:23,021 --> 00:14:25,630
gives each person like
$300 a week pension,

251
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:28,420
which is like two 60 American.
Right.

252
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:33,070
So my parents live off that and then,
but my father takes care of all the money.

253
00:14:33,071 --> 00:14:36,040
He pays all the bills and he balanced
the books because my mom can't be trusted

254
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,890
when it comes to shopping. And so I'm
talking to my parents. My mom goes,

255
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,840
all I want is my half of the money,
his half of the money and then will,

256
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,190
he can have his half of the money.

257
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:48,250
It will split the bills and then I
can do what I want with my money,

258
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,490
but instead I'm given an allowance
because I'm not responsible with money.

259
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,810
I said, ma'am, you can't
take care of the money ma'am.

260
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:57,070
You can't because you'll fuck
it up. You'll go online, you've,

261
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,990
you've found Internet shopping now
you'll fuck it up. You'll get rid of,

262
00:14:59,991 --> 00:15:03,140
you'll lose everything and
get more credit. Cards will
be terrible. And she goes,

263
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:06,170
Oh,
I'm not the problem with money anymore.

264
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:09,260
Your father's the one that spends all
the money. Now we're in a public bar,

265
00:15:09,261 --> 00:15:12,980
by the way, there's many people sitting
around us. It's a very public, open area.

266
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,590
Your father's the one who spends all
the money now and then she pointed,

267
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,250
my dad goes, tell him, tell him
what you spend your money on.

268
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,880
And I've already clicked what this might
be. And I've gone, oh no, wait, look on.

269
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:25,450
I want to know. I don't want
to know. And then it goes,

270
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:30,260
your father gets prostitutes,
right? And I've gone,

271
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,990
Oh God,

272
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,230
just shut up both of your
employees and she's gone.

273
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,870
Yet every Wednesday,
your father,

274
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:43,850
before he goes to play lawn bowls goes
off and gets himself a prostitute and

275
00:15:43,851 --> 00:15:46,430
then my dad went,
not every Wednesday,

276
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:54,610
he didn't even try.
Not every Wednesday makes you,

277
00:15:54,611 --> 00:15:57,050
it sounds like at least
three out of four Wednesdays.

278
00:15:57,051 --> 00:16:00,220
It takes a week off every now
and again. Yeah, like it costs,

279
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:02,960
you mean Australian money
for a very cheap prostitute.

280
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,820
It's legal in Australia and a brothel,

281
00:16:04,821 --> 00:16:09,550
maybe a hundred bucks for a pretty low
in sort of girl or Robin Tag Palace.

282
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:12,260
So he went to a place to get
it done. He didn't, no, no, no.

283
00:16:12,261 --> 00:16:15,140
It's not like here where you've got to
go to a hotel and all type of stuff.

284
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,700
They just brothels and they're,

285
00:16:16,701 --> 00:16:19,580
they're very legal and very well
signposted and stuff. It's not,

286
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:22,160
it's not such a big deal in Australia.

287
00:16:22,161 --> 00:16:26,090
It's actually makes it a bit safer,
if anything,

288
00:16:26,091 --> 00:16:27,470
because the girls have to get tested,

289
00:16:27,471 --> 00:16:30,110
they have to bring their results in
all the time and they're paying taxes.

290
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:32,190
It's safer.
It's like everything else.

291
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:34,560
As soon as the government
says it can't be a legal,

292
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:36,680
when it's something that
people really enjoy doing,

293
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,850
lowest divorce substantially.
Of course it does.

294
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,550
I don't begrudge my dad for doing this.
I just don't want to hear about it.

295
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:48,750
They're in their seventies. My mom
morbidly obese. My Dad still quite fit.

296
00:16:48,751 --> 00:16:50,940
Of course he wants to get
his end away sometimes

297
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:55,770
is end away. There's a book called
the sex at dawn by this guy,

298
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:00,420
Dr Chris Ryan. I do a podcast
with him once a month and uh,

299
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:05,640
he basically goes over in great detail.
Like what,

300
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:08,250
what is the root cause of, of, you know,

301
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:11,860
the reason why men want to breed
with more than one woman. Why is um,

302
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:15,930
why is marriage do so poorly? Why does so
many people want to stray? It's genetic.

303
00:17:15,931 --> 00:17:17,340
It's 100% genetic.

304
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:22,550
If you could squash that with
robot fucked dolls or prostitution,

305
00:17:22,711 --> 00:17:26,370
that's legal, like whatever you
have that's non relationship based,

306
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:29,150
he's going somewhere ruining
anyone else's life. Right?

307
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,220
You're just getting some sex.
That's it. Only sex. What did,

308
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,130
what are prostitutes over in,
in Australia?

309
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,620
Are they thought of differently
than prostitutes here?

310
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,930
Like is it not that big of it?

311
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,970
It's not as big of a deal.
They, I thought of the,

312
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:46,970
they're not like given a load of
respect or anything. It's not like,

313
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:52,320
like in Germany, Holland and stuff is
really not a big deal, you know. But,

314
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:57,170
uh, no, it's, it's still
kept fairly, you know,

315
00:17:57,171 --> 00:17:59,760
th th th the clubs that cold things
like the big one in Melbourne called the

316
00:17:59,761 --> 00:18:03,810
daily planet and it looks like it looks
like the front of the daily planet from

317
00:18:03,811 --> 00:18:06,550
Superman with the big globe.
You know,

318
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,210
Melbourne that's in Melbourne.

319
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:14,130
That's the brothel I went to when I took
my friend with muscular dystrophy to

320
00:18:14,131 --> 00:18:16,230
the brothel work,
which is what my TV show legit,

321
00:18:16,231 --> 00:18:21,220
which is on Wednesdays and Fx exit
10:00 PM we need writings. Um, but it,

322
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,440
it, it, uh,

323
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:26,850
that was the whole basis of my TV show
was taken a disabled guy to a brothel.

324
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:30,300
Yeah. Wow. This season,
incidentally, talking about my dad,

325
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,840
my father will be played
by George Lazenby who, uh,

326
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:39,390
was James Bond for one movie. George
Lazenby. Why do I know that name?

327
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,130
He was James Bond. No,
that's not why I know it.

328
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,460
It's actually there's a Paul
lays and beat who's um, uh,

329
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:48,570
mixed martial arts commentator
far right. All George. Oh,

330
00:18:48,571 --> 00:18:52,500
George isn't related to anything of that
lays and B is what got me. I was like,

331
00:18:52,501 --> 00:18:54,750
why do I know that George is just,
George did one,

332
00:18:54,751 --> 00:18:59,751
James Bond film was booked to do seven
and then he told him to fuck off after

333
00:18:59,821 --> 00:19:02,130
after Sean Connery because
you went ah, this, this,

334
00:19:02,131 --> 00:19:06,330
this franchise isn't going to go on for
too long because it was 1970. He's like,

335
00:19:06,331 --> 00:19:08,580
everyone wants to look
like long hair and beards.

336
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:12,900
No one wants to look like this fucking
idiot from a bank and he told him to fuck

337
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:15,180
off and he never was
really in a movie again.

338
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:17,970
You can't tell him to fuck off
when they ask you to be James Bond.

339
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:20,760
He was in my own model, never
acted before. Really. He just,

340
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:25,720
he just went straight into
it. He's like, he's got some
fucking stories, man. No, no.

341
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:28,110
If you, if you pull up a
picture of the guy, if you a,

342
00:19:28,111 --> 00:19:30,210
if you've taught George Lazenby,

343
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:34,440
you'll see like now he's in his mid
seventies but like in these day was the

344
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:38,910
number one male model on earth in like
1969 the number one male model on earth

345
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:41,310
and he was from a country
town in Australia there is

346
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,970
Hansel bastard,
beautiful genetics.

347
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,700
It's got that 1970 handsome
thing going on too.

348
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,370
That's like that wouldn't
really fly today. Yeah.

349
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,880
It's like they had poor nutrition.
They're eating fucking

350
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:58,090
well. Everyone was sort of shorter. He's
like six foot four and he's sort of a,

351
00:19:58,091 --> 00:19:59,580
you know,
we got to like you guys a,

352
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,740
a bit of a bubble head motion going
on in a big dimple in his chin.

353
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:06,670
Yeah, but like look at his face it,
there's almost something about his face.

354
00:20:06,671 --> 00:20:07,980
Like pull that picture up again.
Oh,

355
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:10,690
it's like the good looks in
the 80s with different people.

356
00:20:10,691 --> 00:20:13,030
Like Molly Ringwald wouldn't ruin.
Now pull the same picture up.

357
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,550
Go back to that picture.
There's a,

358
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:20,290
like there's something about this guy and
I don't know if it's his style of hair,

359
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:23,800
but that's not a guy from today,
but you know what I mean?

360
00:20:23,801 --> 00:20:28,780
Like in 2014 okay, what, who
is, how old is he? About 37
38 years old. And his photo,

361
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:33,620
no, no, no, no, no. This is, no,
no. If he's 70 now this is 19 set.

362
00:20:33,621 --> 00:20:35,510
That's 1969 when that film was made,

363
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:40,790
so he was probably 24 or something
like that. How's that possible?

364
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:44,750
Back in the day everyone was
smoking and drinking and it was a,

365
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,130
you all looked a little bit more leathery.
Put that picture back up,

366
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:52,930
look, look, look at it. Like
if you saw that photo and
said, where's this guy from?

367
00:20:52,931 --> 00:20:56,410
Like what time is this?
You would say like the 70s what is that?

368
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,930
This is like something
about his fucking face.

369
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:03,790
Like that's not a guy that was born after,
you know, 1920 or something like that.

370
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,450
You know what I mean? Does that
weird thing that they have like a,

371
00:21:07,451 --> 00:21:10,510
he looks like a guy from this,
like Burt Reynolds in his prime.

372
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:14,400
That guy doesn't exist
today. No, we're all,

373
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,040
we're all slightly changing
something in the field.

374
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:21,160
I think that women's faces in the ids
where rounder. Oh I think you're right.

375
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,053
Moon faces.

376
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:27,190
Oh that was deemed to be a good look
and we now shun the moon faced woman.

377
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:33,430
The moon face woman in the 80s was
a thing. Yeah. Is it a weight thing?

378
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:38,050
It's a weight thing, right? I don't know.
Like you guys know. I'm like that's a,

379
00:21:38,051 --> 00:21:42,130
that's a real issue for women to get so
skinny that they lose like the roundness

380
00:21:42,131 --> 00:21:46,360
of their face. Like they want
to have like, like sculpted
cheeks. It's a moon face.

381
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:51,070
Two. That's a quarter moon.

382
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,010
What do you,

383
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,670
what is he going to do now that he's
retired too and a lot of comedy.

384
00:21:54,671 --> 00:21:58,160
Apparently I'm not doing a lot of shows
at the comedy magic club cause he's to

385
00:21:58,161 --> 00:22:00,370
do every Sunday night.
He used to try it as monologue.

386
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,380
I'm there actually the
30th I was just there.

387
00:22:02,381 --> 00:22:05,020
I'm doing probably like
one or so every month.

388
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,530
I probably do at the Sunday nights
cause he's, he's on the road now.

389
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:11,590
He's just doing comedy. Is He
a good standup? I shooed me,

390
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:15,940
let me tell you something. At one point
in time he was thought of and it's, it's,

391
00:22:15,941 --> 00:22:20,590
it's tough to judge because you got to
judge it based on the fact that this 1970

392
00:22:20,591 --> 00:22:25,591
and everything from 1970 doesn't hold
up like a few movies set for him.

393
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,630
There's a few movies but like
television shows for example,

394
00:22:28,631 --> 00:22:31,300
try to watch a television show from
the 70s they're very, very dated.

395
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:35,170
So his comedy, it's hard to
date it just like Lenny Bruce.

396
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,930
I always can see that he's the
most important standup ever,

397
00:22:37,931 --> 00:22:40,600
but I don't want to watch them. I don't
want to listen to them. I've tried,

398
00:22:40,601 --> 00:22:44,230
I sit down and listen to the tapes
and I try to s two, two alien a time.

399
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,700
It's not us. You know, we were too free.
You know what he's saying? It's done.

400
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:52,270
You can get like from the ids,
you can still enjoy pickle pry.

401
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:53,870
You can still watch,
Ken isn't,

402
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,920
you can still watch things changed
considerably though. I think in the,

403
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:01,480
from the 1960 [inaudible] 1970s Cosby.
Yeah.

404
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:04,570
Yeah. You can still, yeah,
well he's a master. You know,

405
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,380
he's a really a master wordsmith and a
master storyteller, but it's also, he's,

406
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,650
he was dealing mercy that
I at that stage at, Oh,

407
00:23:11,651 --> 00:23:13,720
I've got a wife and young
kids and it's just how it is.

408
00:23:13,721 --> 00:23:16,980
And that stuff always sticks
around if you're a political guide,

409
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:20,290
always dates very horrible.
Yes. That's so true.

410
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,650
Or if you're talking about society and
how this is fucked up and that it's

411
00:23:23,651 --> 00:23:25,870
fucked up, that doesn't, you know, it's,

412
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:29,650
it's interesting culturally to go back
and listen to some shit where people were

413
00:23:29,651 --> 00:23:31,030
complaining about,
you know,

414
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,090
like Lenny Bruce has some stuff where
he's complaining about politicians.

415
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:38,830
It doesn't, it doesn't make you
laugh though. But anyway, Leno,

416
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:42,220
it's hard to say. Well, when
you look at his stuff now,

417
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:46,220
because it just seems so pedestrian.
But I think that back in the 1970s

418
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,780
Lenna Lenna was a motherfucker.

419
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,810
The reason I say it's because all
the comics said they all, yeah,

420
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:54,950
they're all the guys who knew
him back then go. He was a
bad motherfucker. He was,

421
00:23:54,951 --> 00:23:56,780
he was the legit comic.
He was really good.

422
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:59,350
He was the guy in the club
that everyone in when he's,

423
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,980
he came down who's a hard worker but
then somewhere along the line he stopped

424
00:24:03,981 --> 00:24:07,040
writing. This is kinda
interesting. Like he would go to a,

425
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:10,670
he would do shows like an and
do the same show the next year,

426
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,710
go back to the same
place next year verbatim.

427
00:24:12,711 --> 00:24:17,210
Every joke from the beginning to the
end and like the people in Edmonton,

428
00:24:17,211 --> 00:24:19,730
I was in Edmonton and they were
telling me like we went to see him be,

429
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,400
he did another set and
like play some of this.

430
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:27,940
I'm originally from the United States
and United States. People hit tonight.

431
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,990
It's funny cause he's in America.

432
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:35,590
I have a slight cold,
I have to apologize for that.

433
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:40,910
I've had is about two weeks went to
the hospital over here when the large

434
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:45,720
hospitals in California, I don't want to
say the name, healthcare isn't this day.

435
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,600
This is absolutely true.

436
00:24:46,601 --> 00:24:51,601
I went in and charge me $40 gave me some
pills to take and on the way out as a

437
00:24:51,731 --> 00:24:54,880
doc, my throat is still really solid. Do
you think I should have? My tonsils out

438
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:59,880
is a specialist and I'm showing the best
hospitals in California. Says to me,

439
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:01,340
well what are you

440
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,160
watching the local news

441
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:13,620
shut the fuck up.

442
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:19,710
Everybody who told me he's great,
you shut the fuck up. I imagine,

443
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:25,320
imagine if they buy came into you
and before the podcast I say, I said,

444
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:29,600
I want your opinion
and you ran that bar

445
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,050
and then the guy goes,
what do you think?

446
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,230
Yeah,

447
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:36,890
and then there were Steve Martin,
but that's the beginning of a bit.

448
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:40,930
That's what the beginning of a rant
like what do I think, motherfucker?

449
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:44,080
Isn't this your job that you've got
to go into the next week? Then we'll,

450
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:48,180
it would be a bit, that would be the bid.
It wouldn't be, it was a setup for a bit.

451
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,970
Steve Martin was still funny. Yeah,
he was brilliant and that was,

452
00:25:50,971 --> 00:25:54,300
this is from the same year and I
bet you it blows all that away.

453
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,340
Well he was very different.

454
00:25:56,370 --> 00:26:00,440
You know Steve Martin was one of the
most uniquely original like onstage

455
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:01,350
performance.

456
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:06,470
I can't believe he brought out to so
many recordings and not actual video.

457
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:09,960
Like you're such a visual act to go,

458
00:26:09,961 --> 00:26:13,470
oh I'm going to have an arrow on my
head and put this onto a cassette.

459
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:14,281
One of my,

460
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:17,940
what I was going to say about Jay Leno
was Jay Leno stopped putting things out.

461
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:21,220
He doesn't do anything. It doesn't do an
HBO special, won't do a showtime special.

462
00:26:21,221 --> 00:26:23,970
It doesn't do anything. Have you
noticed like there's no body of work.

463
00:26:23,971 --> 00:26:26,130
There's like one thing
he did for showtime,

464
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:30,660
like in the early 1980s and I
used to have it on a VHS cassette,

465
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:35,210
but after that, nothing. And you know
when they ask them, but I was like, wait,

466
00:26:35,211 --> 00:26:38,350
why would I do then I get there
at showtime, I gave him my bit.

467
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:42,780
My whole act is going to write
a new act. No, give it to them.

468
00:26:42,781 --> 00:26:43,980
And now this is how it's gonna make

469
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,880
me millions of dollars because his
attitude, like his act was like a,

470
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:51,120
he's just real old school in that respect.
Like those guys,

471
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:54,540
they thought about if they did an
HBO special, they didn't think, oh,

472
00:26:54,541 --> 00:26:57,810
this is just going to get my comedy
out to more people. They'll enjoy it.

473
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,170
It'll get more people to come
see me. No. It was like, oh,

474
00:27:01,171 --> 00:27:04,070
I'm going to give them my Emma selling
my aunt and then I can't do my Eric.

475
00:27:04,071 --> 00:27:07,290
Then if I can't do my act, I'm losing
all that. I eat that. I get to my yet.

476
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:11,820
I tried to do a Davy Day every sort
of 18 months or so and then yeah,

477
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:14,040
I retire the material as
soon as I've done it. Yeah,

478
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:17,270
we all do that now, I think. I
think that's the new era. I mean,

479
00:27:17,271 --> 00:27:19,700
once the Internet came along,
I think that's mandatory.

480
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,840
You know George Carlin always did it
and then Louie CK started doing it and

481
00:27:23,841 --> 00:27:26,810
telling people that he did it and then
you start looking around who all the

482
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:31,640
people that do it. Like bird does it,
you do it. Um, you know, Ari does it.

483
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:34,200
It's, it's one of those things now
I think the kind of everybody does.

484
00:27:34,201 --> 00:27:34,950
It's expected.
Yeah.

485
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:38,490
Yeah. I think I also, now I don't do,

486
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:42,450
I won't do stand up on television for
four minutes. I want either. Good for you.

487
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:43,623
That's for fucking year.

488
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,530
I just knocked back doing Fallon
for that and they're like,

489
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:51,330
like not anything special.
Like if I can be a guest on a show,

490
00:27:51,331 --> 00:27:54,030
like I'm doing Kimble next
week or whatever, that's fine,

491
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:58,500
but I don't want to burn four minutes
that I could put onto an actual special,

492
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,970
well, not only that, it's not your act.

493
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:04,670
Yeah. And it doesn't, I don't translate
well over four minutes. No one knows.

494
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:09,970
I feel like the tonight
show culture in America,

495
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,440
the late night show culture in America
fucked up a lot of comedians for a very

496
00:28:14,441 --> 00:28:17,200
long time because they'd come over to
Europe and they look at all the British

497
00:28:17,201 --> 00:28:17,920
acts and go,
Geez,

498
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:21,070
you all your stories are so long winded
and autonomous stuff where everyone over

499
00:28:21,071 --> 00:28:24,490
here seemed to for a very long time
trying to make a snappy five minutes.

500
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,040
And that's not where it's
at in the long term. Yes,

501
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:30,670
totally. Right. It ruined Boston
comedy. There's a whole special,

502
00:28:30,671 --> 00:28:33,180
a whole documentary that kind of France,
Alameda,

503
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:36,640
who was a Boston comic did about
it called when standup stood out.

504
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:40,540
And it's all about Steven, right?
Making it and Steven. Right. Getting on.

505
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:44,420
Was it Letterman? Did Steven Right?
Get on Letterman or tonight show? Uh,

506
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:45,323
it was Letterman.

507
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:49,350
Probably w whichever one it was either
the Letterman or tonight show the, the,

508
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,620
the, the documentary is excellent,
but it shows how everybody change.

509
00:28:53,621 --> 00:28:55,830
Then they all started
doing clean material there.

510
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,610
I'll start trying to get
on television until like,

511
00:28:57,611 --> 00:28:59,830
when am I going to get fucking
picked up? What's going on? Well,

512
00:28:59,831 --> 00:29:02,770
when's this going to happen to
me? This is a, the documentary.

513
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:03,801
There was nothing.

514
00:29:03,801 --> 00:29:08,720
It was like being on an island in the
only thing there was was trying and make

515
00:29:08,721 --> 00:29:09,710
the audience laugh.

516
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:16,580
This city by storm and without even
knowing it ignited the biggest standup

517
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,193
revolution.

518
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:28,330
Me In here. Hi Girl, how are Ya?

519
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:34,783
I love that

520
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,000
that was unnecessary

521
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:47,260
hold apart by excess success,
clashing egos,

522
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:51,310
even death threats.
All in the name of stand up comedy.

523
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,090
Comedy has become a thriving business.

524
00:29:55,091 --> 00:29:58,940
It's club owners spilled their rooms
to capacity weekend after weekend.

525
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:01,370
It was a really good
time to be doing stamina.

526
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,700
That was like the beginning of thinking.

527
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,270
There's a big future in this critics
called when standup stood out.

528
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,460
Hugely entertaining and hilarious and
have voted it one of the greatest standup

529
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:15,460
movies of all time. Convenience for
Jews like rock stuff. It's like,

530
00:30:15,461 --> 00:30:18,220
what do we call unbroken

531
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:24,430
official selection at the Montreal comedy
festival and winner of the Telluride

532
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:29,040
independent film festival
built type friends. So Lomita.

533
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:30,580
It's a great movie,

534
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:34,880
but the point being they're yummy. Look
Amazing, Huh? That was when he was,

535
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,170
when he, he was pretty revolutionary
man. Hey, Steven Wright came along,

536
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,490
nobody was like him before

537
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:45,500
he came to see me at Caroline's and a
with these promises or something like

538
00:30:45,501 --> 00:30:47,140
that. And um, you know,

539
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:50,510
after you signed your DVDs and siding and
doing photos and stuff from that foyer

540
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:55,930
and he waited in line with everyone and
he came and bought a DVD and side goes,

541
00:30:56,391 --> 00:30:59,180
I thought you were great like that. Right.
And I was like, what? Who is this kid?

542
00:30:59,181 --> 00:31:00,740
I know this kind of thing,
but he's just like,

543
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:04,850
he's just like an old guy in a baseball
bat. And I went, oh, Steven, right.

544
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:09,560
Anyway, yeah, yeah, yeah. And then
he walked away and then I went

545
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:13,990
standing next to all these comedy
fans and no one had noticed him.

546
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:14,860
It's the beard,
right?

547
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,181
Soso also the hat,

548
00:31:16,181 --> 00:31:19,780
but you wouldn't expect him to queue up
if you went to the front of the line and

549
00:31:19,781 --> 00:31:20,351
said hello.

550
00:31:20,351 --> 00:31:23,590
People would have noticed him because
he stood there so incognito and did it.

551
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:27,130
And then I went, fucking hell,
everyone. That was Steven ride.

552
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:30,520
And then all the people who were waiting
to take a photo of me chased off,

553
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,870
no one that took a photo with
me after that or bought DVDs.

554
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:40,610
I was in the middle of
having a conversation with
Robin Williams at the Improv

555
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:44,450
and I didn't realize it was Robin Williams
until halfway into the conversation.

556
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:48,110
I thought he was just some dude who came
to the show and wanted to talk to me

557
00:31:48,111 --> 00:31:51,900
after the show and he's talking to me
about the dolphin bit, the dolphins,

558
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:55,190
the Eden Mushrooms,
and or eaten a pot Brownie.

559
00:31:55,191 --> 00:31:58,520
I went on a boat and I had this life
changing experience in Hawaii playing with

560
00:31:58,521 --> 00:32:03,521
dolphins and I'm telling the story on
stage and Robin Williams comes up to me

561
00:32:03,951 --> 00:32:07,420
and he's, he's talking to me about the
bid and we're talking and I'm like, oh,

562
00:32:07,421 --> 00:32:12,350
it's just this cool old dude.
This is fucking Robin Williams and shit.

563
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:14,540
He's a tiny little fella,
but it was just,

564
00:32:14,541 --> 00:32:18,040
it was a bizarre thing like in the middle
of the conversation. I'm just going,

565
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:21,380
I'll, thanks man. Thank you. Whoa.

566
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:27,130
I have a theory on why actors in some
comedians are super short in comparison to

567
00:32:28,791 --> 00:32:31,280
the general populace need for attention.
Yeah.

568
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:34,150
I was at the Fox with the TV show.

569
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:38,330
There's a potty they have for Fox
for everything that's Fox related,

570
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:40,220
where star of every show

571
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:43,700
has to show up. It's in your
contract, you have to be there. Right.

572
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:47,450
And all the reporters go
around and talk to your site.

573
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:51,200
So there's people like this famous people
and then there's like Jennifer Lopez

574
00:32:51,201 --> 00:32:52,850
walked in and then all the
famous people were like, wow,

575
00:32:52,851 --> 00:32:55,820
this isn't a real famous person. You
know. But then I was staying next to like,

576
00:32:55,821 --> 00:33:00,020
like uh, Keith Sutherland was like, looked
like he was five foot nothing to me.

577
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:03,470
Really? Yeah he was, he's a big
guy cause he plays Jack Bauer.

578
00:33:03,471 --> 00:33:04,550
You think he's a big guy.

579
00:33:04,551 --> 00:33:08,360
And then Martin Freeman was there cause
he's in now the new Fargo and he's a

580
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:09,194
itty bitty

581
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,960
Fargo.
They have a Fargo TV show now.

582
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,880
Yeah. Effects to bring
it out. And it's got,

583
00:33:12,881 --> 00:33:17,881
it's got Billy Bob Thornton and
Martin frame and Kate Walsh is in it.

584
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:18,260
Yeah.

585
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:21,530
Holy Shit. Who is, does it have
anything to do with the Cohen brothers?

586
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:25,340
Uh, it's, it, I don't know if it's to,

587
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:28,360
but it's being reviewed through the roof.
People are saying it's the best thing.

588
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,010
It's coming out in like 16 days.

589
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:33,700
Oh, that's beautiful. Oh, that's,
I fucking love that movie.

590
00:33:33,701 --> 00:33:37,150
That's one of my all time favorite
comedies because there's no jokes in the

591
00:33:37,151 --> 00:33:42,110
entire fucking thing. It's just fuck
up after fuck up after, you know,

592
00:33:42,111 --> 00:33:46,030
just, it's a completely character
driven thing. That car salesman,

593
00:33:46,031 --> 00:33:50,030
the failure car salesman that fucks
everything up. What's that cat's name? Uh,

594
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:53,530
I don't know. I haven't seen
the guy who was in shameless

595
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,860
show them the billboard that posts,
they got the bus stops,

596
00:33:56,861 --> 00:33:58,690
which is like a knitted fucking rug.

597
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:04,360
Ah, that's pretty cool. What is
that guys? What's that guy's name?

598
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:08,890
Who uh, it's on that shameless
show on HBO or on Showtime? Uh,

599
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:13,100
the guy who plays the lead. Yeah,
he's in mystery man as well. Yeah.

600
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:17,120
Was that just the shovel bill Macy? Yeah.
Right. William H Macy. What do you match?

601
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:20,740
My is, he's a very nice guy. I met
that guy when I was on news radio.

602
00:34:20,741 --> 00:34:25,720
He's super friendly, very, very friendly
guy. Is He short though? Uh, I'm short.

603
00:34:25,721 --> 00:34:28,390
So it's hard to tell.
Everybody seems giant to me.

604
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,270
Everything is,

605
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:32,360
everything in this world is just like
simply used to a bit is everything is just

606
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:36,190
people trying to pick up chicks cause
that's why you get into anything like not

607
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:39,980
not in the long term, but in your
younger years, in your teens.

608
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:43,260
It's just about how can I make women
how Scott, how can I make money?

609
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:46,280
So if you're at school and
you're a good looking guy,

610
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:47,570
then that's your why you're meeting women.

611
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:51,080
If you're just a really good looking
guy and if you're really good at sport,

612
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:54,680
that's your why. But if you're
short, you better be fucking funny.

613
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:57,050
Or if you're not good looking,
you better be funny.

614
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:00,350
Or if you're not funny and
you're all those things,

615
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:04,700
then you better learn how to
do a Shakespearian monologue
in fucking drama class.

616
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,620
I better have something you
better have some little,

617
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,300
makes you a little thing that's
different from everybody else.

618
00:35:11,301 --> 00:35:15,290
So I think that's why all the actors,
I think re cause all the actresses a toll.

619
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:18,030
Some of them are,
there's a lot of shorter,

620
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:21,030
they're like Nicole came in,
she'd say she marries Tom Cruise,

621
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,050
he's itty bitty feller.

622
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:25,640
He's not as Itty bitty is. Everybody
says it's Sorta like the polling thing.

623
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:29,870
Her new husband's really small. Well, you
know, Napoleon wasn't really a short guy.

624
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,240
I didn't know that.
British propaganda.

625
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:36,130
Oh William was actually taller than the
average person at the time. Really? Yeah.

626
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:38,250
Yeah.
Well it wasn't tall compared to today.

627
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:41,760
He's like five six. Yeah. But
back then everybody was fucking,

628
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:45,420
they were really tiny. Right. So that
was thinking he's four. But Tom Cruise,

629
00:35:45,421 --> 00:35:48,630
apparently I've, I've talked to people
like I've met Sylvester Stallone.

630
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:52,010
He's not that small. Everybody would say.
So most of the loans, only five, six,

631
00:35:52,011 --> 00:35:55,170
he played a rocky and the movies, he
was a heavier, he's not five, six.

632
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,260
I met the guy, he's at
least five, 10 maybe taller,

633
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,770
and he was wearing some shit in his
shoes. I don't know. But I'm five,

634
00:36:01,771 --> 00:36:03,090
eight I don't wear any shit in my shoes.

635
00:36:03,091 --> 00:36:07,050
And I where I'm standing like right
next to the guy and he's taller than me.

636
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:09,810
I met Ben Kingsley and
he's like the opposite.

637
00:36:09,811 --> 00:36:13,680
They try to make him look smaller in
film it was a reasonable size guy.

638
00:36:13,681 --> 00:36:16,470
But whenever you seem in film they try
to make him look like a little tiny

639
00:36:16,471 --> 00:36:17,304
menacing book.

640
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:21,500
Well when Bar Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise
did that vampire movie together,

641
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:24,830
Tom Cruise walked on like
a platform around him.

642
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:26,450
So they were like similar heights.

643
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:30,470
So like everywhere they walked
when they were, you know,

644
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:34,780
doing the thing like Brad
Pitt is essentially walking
into a ditch that may or

645
00:36:34,781 --> 00:36:36,980
may not be true. I wasn't
there when it was filming. No,

646
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:39,980
I might have just made that up.
It might be,

647
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:43,190
might be just total Richard
Gere dribble in the ass.

648
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:47,260
Even on my TV show I fed it. We'd
win the season. I get the kids,

649
00:36:47,261 --> 00:36:50,500
two girls and one girl was like five
foot tall and Mongo was six foot tall.

650
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:54,910
It definitely looks better when you're
kissing a six foot tall. Go. Really? Yeah,

651
00:36:54,911 --> 00:36:56,800
because like I'm the same height as that.

652
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:58,600
You just have to turn
your head and you like,

653
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:03,730
but when all of a sudden he kiss in a
real short person and you're hunched over,

654
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:06,010
right, it doesn't look cool on film. Yeah.

655
00:37:06,011 --> 00:37:08,300
That's why they like you to pick them up.
Uh,

656
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:11,140
say I'm on a toll weak person.

657
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:17,680
I can't do that. We all have our
limitations. Is this the actors? Okay,

658
00:37:17,681 --> 00:37:22,430
so Danny Devito suit easy is super
small. Yeah, he's five foot and then uh,

659
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:26,740
I think he's under J. Fox is
just a five foot four. Uh,

660
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:28,380
same with Emilia estimators.

661
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:31,220
Then you go up to the woody Allen's
and they tested Emilio. Estefan is,

662
00:37:31,221 --> 00:37:35,740
is five foot four I, Yup. See? How do I
know they're not making this up though?

663
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:40,180
Woody Allen's taller and Emilio Estevez
for real. Woody Allen's five, five.

664
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:43,210
Yeah. He's a funny little
fella. And Jack Black.

665
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:48,590
I passed him yesterday at the
airport and no one was bothering him.

666
00:37:48,591 --> 00:37:51,430
And You wonder why.
I think he was wearing his neck pillow.

667
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:54,250
It was covering up a lot of these fights.

668
00:37:54,251 --> 00:37:56,710
He had it like with the little
velcro strap around his neck.

669
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,940
He just looked like a schlumpy sorta guy
who had to get his flight and he didn't

670
00:38:00,941 --> 00:38:02,860
look like a movie style.
I'll tell you that much.

671
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:05,220
That's a good move in the
neck pillow because no one,

672
00:38:05,221 --> 00:38:08,250
if you don't want people talking to
wear a neck pillow because there's that

673
00:38:08,251 --> 00:38:10,080
extra step that they have to take,

674
00:38:10,081 --> 00:38:13,440
like cause that fucking guy wearing a
neck pillow and then they decided not to

675
00:38:13,441 --> 00:38:13,950
talk.

676
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:17,690
It's not sure that it looks like you're
obviously ready for a slate so you don't

677
00:38:17,691 --> 00:38:20,180
want to be bothered. Bothered
bothers someone who wants to sleep.

678
00:38:20,181 --> 00:38:21,080
It's a very good point.

679
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,890
People the same type of people that
bother you while you're eating. Yeah.

680
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:27,920
Do you get people that come up to you
while you do that? After he got a high,

681
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:32,930
I don't want to, I don't want to interrupt
you, but I interrupt you. Will you do?

682
00:38:32,931 --> 00:38:36,520
You do want to interrupt me. You feel
bad about it? I want to interrupt you,

683
00:38:36,521 --> 00:38:38,500
but I feel bad about it
is what you should say.

684
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:39,940
Yeah.

685
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:44,790
They're just trying to find a way to be
not rude while they're being rude or not

686
00:38:44,791 --> 00:38:47,050
even being rude. I understand
that people want to say hello,

687
00:38:47,051 --> 00:38:49,080
especially if you're just saying the show.

688
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,440
If you're eating and you
have a mouthful of food. Yes.

689
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,340
That's where I draw the line.

690
00:38:53,341 --> 00:38:55,440
Like when you're sitting down to eat
and you're with your friends and people

691
00:38:55,441 --> 00:38:58,710
come over to the table, like if everybody
did that, it would be fucking chaos.

692
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:00,990
Like there's a certain amount of,
you know,

693
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:06,410
of privacy that a person should or just
the piece that a person should be able

694
00:39:06,961 --> 00:39:10,680
to get and while I'm person's eating
their meal, that's where I draw the line.

695
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:15,220
Well, how, how are you happy with your
level? You almost famous to me, right?

696
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:19,870
I'm mildly famous. You're famous,
famous, and then there's the next.

697
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,690
You don't want to go there.
You don't want to go, I think.

698
00:39:22,691 --> 00:39:25,000
I think I'd like to go up to
about where you are and then stop

699
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:28,440
low. Even back it down a little.
I'm trying to back it down a little.

700
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:32,470
I'm trying to take, take a little
bit of the edge off. It's like,

701
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,070
so at the moment I get stopped,

702
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:38,000
I would say four times a day in three
of those people are just say, Hey Jim.

703
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:39,830
And then that's great and that's great.

704
00:39:39,831 --> 00:39:42,290
And then there'll be one personal
take photos and that's no problem.

705
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:43,970
And that's where I'm at right now.

706
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:47,060
But I'm not at the stage where I
can ring a restaurant up and go,

707
00:39:47,061 --> 00:39:51,710
Jim Jefferies needs a table and they'll
fucking find a table because most of the

708
00:39:51,711 --> 00:39:53,330
population doesn't know who I am.
So I'm not,

709
00:39:53,331 --> 00:39:56,930
I would like that because I liked it.
I'm lazy with my reservations.

710
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:00,650
That's what I would like to
get to table restaurant tables.

711
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:05,500
Yeah, restaurant tables helps if you
were a club hopper and you want it to,

712
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:09,280
ah, I got a young kid, um, you
know, I might club up again,

713
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,730
it may be later on in life,
but I can't at the moment.

714
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,170
There's no club at the moment. I'm
just fucking daycare guy. Like,

715
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:21,180
like I'll tell you my sign on
Trump's rallies white again.

716
00:40:21,401 --> 00:40:22,790
So I started going back to the James.

717
00:40:22,791 --> 00:40:27,790
So I got a gym and there's a daycare at
my gym where I can take my son and just

718
00:40:27,791 --> 00:40:28,624
drop him off.

719
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:32,560
And there's like two ladies in their
50s that just sort of work behind the

720
00:40:32,561 --> 00:40:33,394
counter.

721
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:38,140
And one of my son who's 16 months old
just fucking loves one of these ladies is

722
00:40:38,141 --> 00:40:41,920
this old Asian lady and he lights up
when he sees her and she loves him.

723
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,010
She'll be playing with other
kids and when she sees my son,

724
00:40:45,011 --> 00:40:47,140
she'll just drop what she's
doing and just go, hey bank.

725
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:50,110
And then she says the same
thing every time she'll go,

726
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:54,880
there's my boyfriend here
he is possibly my boyfriend.

727
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:58,990
My boyfriend gives me kisses. And then
she starts kissing him all over the face,

728
00:40:58,991 --> 00:41:00,850
right? And then guys enjoy
your workout. And I walk off.

729
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:05,680
Now I can't do that with a baby girl.
I can never go.

730
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:09,190
There's my girlfriend, my girlfriend
gives me kisses. Give it here.

731
00:41:09,191 --> 00:41:14,020
Enjoy your workout. Why is that? Why
is that so I don't want to do that.

732
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,800
Mind you. I'm not, I'm not fighting for
the freedom to do this in the near future.

733
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:20,080
I just think it's a very odd,

734
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,830
I have a whole bit about it. Yeah. The,

735
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:28,510
there's no sexual equality and
child molesting because there's a,

736
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,291
there's a commercial,

737
00:41:29,291 --> 00:41:32,080
I don't know if you've ever seen the
commercial where there's just for men.

738
00:41:32,081 --> 00:41:35,840
Baby was a bit just from Madison Shit.
That old dudes putting their beard,

739
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:36,621
beard's gone.

740
00:41:36,621 --> 00:41:40,730
Gray is a baby with a beer
and he's driving a Porsche
with a grown woman next to

741
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:43,670
him and the baby goes to
the club and he's dancing.

742
00:41:43,671 --> 00:41:47,060
All these women are running
around kissing him and my,

743
00:41:47,061 --> 00:41:50,660
what I'm saying is in that bed is there's
no sexual equality and John Lawson,

744
00:41:50,661 --> 00:41:54,440
you couldn't make that same
commercial with the sex is reversed.

745
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,260
Look at this baby.
She's got a grown woman.

746
00:41:58,010 --> 00:41:59,840
The baby gets out of the car
and I look at the bouncer,

747
00:41:59,841 --> 00:42:03,080
he recognizes that many points a finger
at him like, oh, it's you. You fuck.

748
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:06,740
And the guy goes in there and he's
got a bottle. Look, he's got a bottle.

749
00:42:06,741 --> 00:42:09,650
Just in case you're thinking, well,
maybe it's a little eccentric midget.

750
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:14,270
So he's doing his little dance and look
surrounded by pussy and a couple of gay

751
00:42:14,271 --> 00:42:17,520
dudes. We just wish they
could get them to turn over.

752
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:21,080
This baby is the shit.
And if you switch the sexist,

753
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:24,740
if you had a bunch of dudes with
Tarzan, loin cloths, swinging cock,

754
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:29,270
like that's baby face, height to
vagina, that babies dancing around.

755
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:33,210
Well, I know China's or write an
ad that's making fun of something.

756
00:42:33,211 --> 00:42:38,160
It's a comedy of commercial. It's meant
to be a joke. But even in real life,

757
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,181
I dunno about you.

758
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:43,110
But whenever you hear like there's a guy
who's been molesting the fucking school,

759
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:47,670
the, the, the, the, the volleyball team,
you always go that fucking creep, right?

760
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:51,930
But then as soon as you hear there's a
female teacher that had sex with a 13

761
00:42:51,931 --> 00:42:55,660
year old boy, you always got, all right,
I'll have to see the photo of this woman.

762
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:01,210
And then if the woman's caught a hot,
you're like, Nah, I could see where he,

763
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:04,910
you know, I don't even blame the kid. I'm
like, no, I would never blame the kid,

764
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:09,180
but I'm like, eh. On and
off. He had a bad time. Yeah.

765
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:12,900
Is that wrong? No, it's not wrong
at all. What I say to my school,

766
00:43:12,901 --> 00:43:16,580
who I would've loved to have fucked when
I was 13 I used to masturbate it to her

767
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:17,423
all the time.

768
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:20,490
There's nothing wrong with it. If she's
hot, that's what people need to accept.

769
00:43:20,491 --> 00:43:21,540
There is something wrong with demand.

770
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:24,540
The difference is a man can
molest a 13 year old girl.

771
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:28,190
A woman can't molest a 13 year old boy.
She could just let him fucker. Yeah.

772
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:29,520
They're two different things.
Yeah.

773
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:32,330
And I say that women develop faster.

774
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:36,290
They do. They do in a lot
of ways. They just, um,

775
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:41,490
they're not allowed to fuck his early.
They can enjoy it. They can enjoy it.

776
00:43:41,491 --> 00:43:44,490
At 13, there's something really creepy
about a man fucking, the 13 year old.

777
00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:47,560
But if you found out your son got caught,
you know,

778
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:50,100
with the teacher bent over
the desk and he's banging her,

779
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:52,530
you fucking be really
kind of proud of him.

780
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:55,930
Yeah. It wouldn't be. It'd be
like, Oh, you shouldn't do that.

781
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:58,480
But it's, it's, it's funny,

782
00:43:58,481 --> 00:44:02,860
like Paul Walker when he died, he, Eh,

783
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:07,570
they found out that he had a girlfriend
for like eight years or something and

784
00:44:07,571 --> 00:44:08,800
when he started dieting,
uh,

785
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:14,190
she was 16 and he was
34 and then on the TV.

786
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:16,780
But then it's like that weird
thing that when their celebrity,

787
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:18,790
even at the end of time at tonight,
we're like,

788
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:23,650
but she was very mature earn she
uh, and you're like, no, no, no, no,

789
00:44:23,651 --> 00:44:25,330
no statutory.
Right man.

790
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:28,720
You can't just change the rules
because the guy is dead now.

791
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:30,640
First of all,
no.

792
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:36,590
But how good must have that pussy been
34 year old movie star is freaking out

793
00:44:37,081 --> 00:44:37,950
about a 16 year old.

794
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,490
Not that good. If you can pull a picture
of shit might not be a good thing.

795
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:45,810
I mean, yeah, she might've had a, she
might've been dynamite [inaudible] pussy,

796
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:50,970
those ones as well. Those girls
with other girls are like this.

797
00:44:50,971 --> 00:44:55,820
She is the 24 or something before she,
but I don't,

798
00:44:56,010 --> 00:44:59,490
I don't begrudge him fucking 16 year old
girl in the sense that you can see some

799
00:44:59,491 --> 00:45:02,190
16 year old goes where you're going and
it's legal in the UK and Australia are,

800
00:45:02,191 --> 00:45:03,024
it's not like it's,

801
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:06,870
I understand wanting to have sex
with a fully developed 16 year old.

802
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:09,960
What I don't get is him dating her.

803
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:14,140
Pull up that picture again. Does that
is an odd picture man. She's like,

804
00:45:14,141 --> 00:45:15,820
oh well she's in her 20s

805
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:16,321
yeah,

806
00:45:16,321 --> 00:45:19,110
this is like when she's like they'd been
dating for seven years or something.

807
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:24,160
You know, I hate the idea of,
look, I have daughters first.

808
00:45:24,161 --> 00:45:27,310
The first thing I'm going to say, this
is not something I'm really entertaining,

809
00:45:27,311 --> 00:45:30,760
but I hate the idea that if two people
really do love each other and for

810
00:45:30,761 --> 00:45:32,410
whatever reason they're perfect together,

811
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:37,210
it can't happen because the
guy's 30 and the girls 16

812
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:42,170
yeah, come on the go. I agree with you.
Has to died a few guys like the chat.

813
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,280
I agree with you. I was devastated
when the goal that's my virginity to,

814
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:50,400
it's 16 up with me and I thought I'd
never find love again and I haven't since

815
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:54,010
really. But I've enjoyed it.

816
00:45:54,011 --> 00:45:57,190
A lot of different women since then.
I just second,

817
00:45:57,290 --> 00:46:00,190
the thing is that's creepy is not the sex,

818
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:02,380
it's the conversation after six.

819
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:06,970
It's the fact that he lied there with
her afterwards and wait, how's school?

820
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:11,440
Thank you and good. And she goes, what
are you been up to? And he is like,

821
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:13,000
I made a movie.

822
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:20,290
It's a very good movie, but it's got a
lot of swear words so you can't say it

823
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:25,510
because you should listen to swear words.

824
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:30,340
Yeah, that's a good point man. That
is the one thing. That's a good point.

825
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:35,530
I think that you know, he should be
able to fucking do whatever he wants.

826
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:37,370
And here's a good looking
guy though, man. You know,

827
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:38,870
I mean he should be able to a,

828
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,210
I mean he should be able to date
anybody who wants a date him,

829
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:45,170
as long as that person is old
enough to make their own choice.

830
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:46,880
The real question is when,

831
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:49,640
when is the age that you're
old enough to make that choice?

832
00:46:49,641 --> 00:46:52,450
Is it 16 is it 17 is it eight?

833
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:56,190
It's 16 in the rest of it, but it's
18 oh Geez. Retained in America.

834
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:59,100
So we mean, so in that sense,
yeah, he broke the law.

835
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:02,730
But just because some shits written
down on paper obviously doesn't mean it

836
00:47:02,731 --> 00:47:03,100
makes.

837
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:06,820
And also we know that he broke
other laws such as speeding. Well,

838
00:47:06,821 --> 00:47:10,070
it wasn't like this guy was,
somebody else killed him. He didn't,

839
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:12,700
he didn't drive that car.
I felt sorry when,

840
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:15,070
when he died and all that type of stuff.

841
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:17,590
It was a lot of deaths
all at once this year.

842
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:22,240
And I felt really sorry for the guy
that made the in Memoriam thing for the

843
00:47:22,241 --> 00:47:26,460
Oscars every night. He must have
sat down and gone. All right. Okay.

844
00:47:26,461 --> 00:47:31,300
The ask is a common Paul Walker,
the gains. Beautiful. I got to bed,

845
00:47:31,301 --> 00:47:35,050
wakes up in the morning. Fucking
Phillip Seymour Hoffman. All right.

846
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:40,690
Phillip Seymour Hoffman the end.
And then like you read the paper,

847
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:45,210
I thought Shirley temple was already
dead. This is bullshit. Put Shelly.

848
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:49,150
She was dead to put Shirley
temple in the end. How old Ram us?

849
00:47:49,151 --> 00:47:52,810
It was just fucking ongoing until
the day he had to make that video.

850
00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:57,710
That guy, uh, James Reb
Horn who, uh, played, uh,

851
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:02,330
carries dad on a homeland.
He died. I did a,

852
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:06,950
I did a pilot with that guy. You ever see
that show? Homeland? I do watch homeland.

853
00:48:06,951 --> 00:48:11,460
Who Plays? Who? Harry's Dad. She plays
the, the father of the main chick.

854
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:17,390
The, the chickens off
of medication. Oh No,

855
00:48:17,391 --> 00:48:19,760
the daughter. Yes. Well, the dad,

856
00:48:19,761 --> 00:48:22,570
the British guy who played
the lead in homeland.

857
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:26,800
No, no, not that guy. The other
one, Carrie. Carrie is the crazy,

858
00:48:26,801 --> 00:48:28,240
a CIA agent.

859
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:33,110
Oh, he's all guy. Gray hair just died.

860
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:36,430
Great Guy. Really,
really, really nice guy.

861
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,790
I was still upset with Fred Phelps.
Thei

862
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:44,050
tried to, Phillips to me is, if you know,

863
00:48:44,051 --> 00:48:46,410
he's the [inaudible] at
Western Baptist Church.

864
00:48:46,411 --> 00:48:49,630
The Westboro Baptist Church
Guy who used to protest,

865
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:51,700
guide people's funerals,

866
00:48:51,701 --> 00:48:55,000
soldier's funerals because he believed
that war started because we were too nice

867
00:48:55,001 --> 00:48:59,830
to gaze. It's got a good point. Well,
this is my, this is my thing, but I,

868
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:00,820
I,
I,

869
00:49:00,821 --> 00:49:05,821
I'm an atheist and I'm also very non
homophobic person in the sense that I,

870
00:49:06,251 --> 00:49:10,450
I uh, I wouldn't even care if my son
was guy. He was loaning. You just have,

871
00:49:10,451 --> 00:49:14,860
I'm of that opinion when it comes
to having sex with, but he was,

872
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:20,130
Fred Phelps was possibly the most why
out there religious person we've had in a

873
00:49:21,341 --> 00:49:23,890
very long time where he
actually had decisions like,

874
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,960
oh the war started must
be because of the guys.

875
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,370
And then you decide it was gospel.
Right?

876
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:32,200
But what if he was the only
bloke on earth that was right?

877
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:37,360
Like he gets to heaven and then God's
like, you're the only one that got me.

878
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:41,440
And then like God sitting up there,
he goes, where's everyone else?

879
00:49:41,441 --> 00:49:42,430
You guys will no one else.

880
00:49:42,431 --> 00:49:45,700
You're the only person that followed it
to the fucking team and everyone else is

881
00:49:45,701 --> 00:49:46,534
in hell.

882
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:49,710
And the two of them just sitting there
and gorgeous and then Frager us faggots,

883
00:49:49,711 --> 00:49:50,990
a concept.
They

884
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:57,770
guard guys damn straight and they fist
pump or something. I don't know. Like if,

885
00:49:57,810 --> 00:50:00,040
if,
if his beliefs were real,

886
00:50:00,041 --> 00:50:02,130
then he's the only black getting
into heaven is the point on made.

887
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:04,690
Well the problem is his beliefs aren't
anywhere. They're not written anywhere.

888
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:09,010
Yeah. But he decided to believe
he may have believed them.

889
00:50:09,011 --> 00:50:10,780
If you listen to the way he talks though,

890
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:14,830
like you ever see the
Eleuthero documentary with
him? We went and visited them,

891
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:17,050
stay with them for three weeks.
It's very interesting.

892
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:20,650
And one of the things you realize is
the amount of ego this guy has. Yeah.

893
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:22,390
And he just wants people to listen to him.

894
00:50:22,391 --> 00:50:26,020
Like he doesn't answer questions sometimes
when when a question comes up he just

895
00:50:26,021 --> 00:50:28,130
says,
I'm not going to even answer that because

896
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:29,600
you're so stupid.

897
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:33,800
He just comes up with some
reason why he superior.

898
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:36,950
There's so much ego involved.
And like what he was doing,

899
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:40,190
the way he was running that church,
it wasn't based on any scripture.

900
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:44,200
I liked how they had to sing songs.
You know,

901
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:46,870
they weren't smart enough
to write their own songs.

902
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:49,680
So they just got songs of artists
who they probably called sin.

903
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:53,260
Sin is to begin with. And just the,
there was the one that they did.

904
00:50:53,261 --> 00:50:57,490
We are the world,
but it was like God hates the guy.

905
00:50:58,150 --> 00:51:02,590
They're all [inaudible] and
it's like Michael Jackson,

906
00:51:02,591 --> 00:51:04,690
Lionel Richie, write that song
and you're telling me that,

907
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,310
that you are fans of this.

908
00:51:06,311 --> 00:51:11,140
And I were pretty close to the model
that you wanted for your church or your

909
00:51:11,141 --> 00:51:11,870
paying rights.

910
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:15,680
Whenever someone is a religious guy and
they try saying in any sort of pop music,

911
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:17,150
you'd automatically kills it.

912
00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:20,270
Like that guy in Australia that thinks
he's Jesus and he sings green day.

913
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:21,583
Have you ever seen that guy?

914
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:24,550
No, he didn't, but I
like, I like him already.

915
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:27,410
You'd never seen the Australian
Jesus? No. Oh, he's awesome.

916
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:31,120
He says he's Jesus and he hangs out
with this hot chick that he banks who

917
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:34,760
apparently used to be Mary
and Mary has a vision.

918
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:39,080
I'm on the cross. I remember
him. I remember him crying.

919
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:41,050
I got a quick get a
picture of his cheek or

920
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:44,730
it's the second check. The one on
the far right is the Mary though.

921
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:49,560
That's the Jesus with the glasses.
Yeah. Right. And Mary apparently,

922
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:53,520
unfortunately just found out recently
that she was the second Mary and there was

923
00:51:53,521 --> 00:51:57,120
another girl that Jesus
said was married before her.

924
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,870
Ah,
that was Mary Magdalen.

925
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:04,790
Yeah. He likes to tell people
he's Jesus to get the pussy.

926
00:52:04,890 --> 00:52:09,630
Oh yeah, I'm Jesus. Yeah. Pain Jesus for
a wall. Really that's his nuclear option.

927
00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:10,370
You've got to listen to it.

928
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:11,203
You got to talk,

929
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:15,140
play some it Brian Cause it's quite
brilliant and you know he's not even an

930
00:52:15,141 --> 00:52:18,710
exceptional guy, which is not the Jesus
of Siberia. It's totally different ones.

931
00:52:18,711 --> 00:52:18,840
Yeah,

932
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:22,740
the faint, this is how the original Jesus
came out and they hung him on a cross.

933
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:25,200
Like there's got to be some guy. If, if,

934
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:27,900
if you believe in God and there's
got to be a second coming,

935
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:32,640
then he's going to cut. These guys got
as much chance as anyone I've been Jesus.

936
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:36,030
No he doesn't. He has zero chance of
being Jesus. If it's a guy, white guy.

937
00:52:36,031 --> 00:52:37,620
He said he was Jesus as well.
Right.

938
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:38,560
Well,

939
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:43,110
he was much like this guy just want to
get some pussy similar listen to them and

940
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,720
they are critical of Miller.
They have, that's not his voice.

941
00:52:46,721 --> 00:52:49,520
That's the narrator's voice.
Um,

942
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:52,340
his voice though is very non Jesus.
Like

943
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:55,200
I, I've always been, how
can you be from Australia?

944
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:57,510
The original Bible didn't
even mention Australia.

945
00:52:57,860 --> 00:53:00,080
Yeah. On Nightline to
the steak. It was like a,

946
00:53:00,081 --> 00:53:04,910
Paul was made the had to tell you that's
not his voice either. He's a Jesus guy.

947
00:53:04,911 --> 00:53:07,460
Was the other guy with the
dark hair and the glasses

948
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:10,400
fucking do and out of this is
I'd fucking day to, he can't,

949
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:13,250
if you could see him talking here,

950
00:53:13,251 --> 00:53:17,630
he goes here spirit. Well,
Yup. You can't listen to this.

951
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,250
Here you go. This is one
of Miller's Dick. Okay.

952
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:26,070
The narrator's wow. Oh
yeah. Quite a bit. Quite

953
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:29,970
a few. Queensland I believe is where
he lives. Uh, fucking Queensland.

954
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:32,213
Is that a spot?

955
00:53:33,530 --> 00:53:35,990
That's the,
that's the Alabama of Australia.

956
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:38,620
Oh, well there you go. That makes sense.

957
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:42,000
It's a little bit, I actually like
Queensland. My father's from Queensland.

958
00:53:42,001 --> 00:53:44,150
I have an affinity for Queensland.
I'll be there in April,

959
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:47,640
selling tickets to the Brisbane
Tivoli theater. But um,

960
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,220
I there they're a little bit,

961
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:52,830
they had a politician for a wall.

962
00:53:52,831 --> 00:53:57,831
They cold Pauline Hanson and Pauline
Hanson was just really racist.

963
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:03,370
It was like the problems, the aboriginals,
and this is why we have to about a,

964
00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:04,860
you know,
she was one of these type of people.

965
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:09,210
She got voted in and then town and uh,

966
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:13,560
and she was sorta these red headed,
what she looked like.

967
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:17,400
She was off a matchbox. She, she,
she was, sees redheaded woman.

968
00:54:17,401 --> 00:54:20,190
It turned out she had a
electoral fraud and she went to,

969
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:24,150
she went to prison for like six
months for us to invite him. Anyway,

970
00:54:24,151 --> 00:54:26,910
she comes out after being really racist,
like,

971
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:29,950
and then saying stupid things like how
would you fix the economy and she goes,

972
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,430
print more money.
Then we'd all have more money.

973
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:36,150
Like this is the level of intelligence.
Jesus Christ, she got voted in, right?

974
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:40,440
So she's like another level path. Sarah
Palin, even in my family, we were like,

975
00:54:40,441 --> 00:54:44,280
that woman's disgusting. I
can't believe that. All these
things. He's like, yeah, no,

976
00:54:44,310 --> 00:54:47,760
she's, she's a rice as Sarah Pylon. That's
a perfect, that's what I'm on. Right.

977
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:50,640
And so she gets put into prison
and then when she comes out,

978
00:54:50,641 --> 00:54:52,880
she goes on dancing with the stars.
Right.

979
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:55,860
And my parents forgive.

980
00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:59,250
My parents will forgive anything
if you do a cracking foxtrot,

981
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:03,360
like they're watching that they were
voting for her God, because my is,

982
00:55:03,410 --> 00:55:08,270
she's got good legs. I got, but she just
said that aboriginal should die. Ah,

983
00:55:08,290 --> 00:55:10,590
he bloody hold on to things for too long.

984
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:14,550
That's so true.

985
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:18,330
Someone was running for president and
they did star search or dancing with the

986
00:55:18,331 --> 00:55:22,170
stars or American idol or whatever
those fucking shows are. And you know,

987
00:55:22,171 --> 00:55:24,030
we're American got to vote
and they did really well.

988
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:24,990
They'd probably become president.

989
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:27,920
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Hi. If she,

990
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,730
let's see if we can get a
picture of Pauline Hanson up.

991
00:55:30,731 --> 00:55:34,540
I haven't had a look at this
woman's face for going on 20 years.

992
00:55:34,541 --> 00:55:35,890
She's done a fish and chip shop.

993
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:39,700
There was like people that she was so
racist people would where Martin Luther

994
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:40,990
King tee shirts on the front that said,

995
00:55:41,050 --> 00:55:43,450
I have a dream and then there'd be a
picture of her on the back of it goes,

996
00:55:43,451 --> 00:55:44,680
I have a fish and chip shop.

997
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:51,160
There she is.
That was that Sarah pilot in Australia.

998
00:55:51,230 --> 00:55:54,530
Well, she even kind of has that thing
going on. That Sarah Palin thing going on.

999
00:55:54,531 --> 00:55:58,400
Yeah. And the Asians, the Asians
come in here and buy all the land.

1000
00:55:59,510 --> 00:56:03,740
Wow. What do you think about these whole
banning bossy? You got retarded, stupid.

1001
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:06,350
Never going to work, but
me, it makes me angry.

1002
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:09,440
It makes me angry that you pretending
that someone's feelings are hurt because

1003
00:56:09,441 --> 00:56:11,350
you have the word bossy.
They tried,

1004
00:56:11,351 --> 00:56:13,340
they said the word bossy
means leadership ship.

1005
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,770
It doesn't like, I have a few nieces
and I won't say which of them.

1006
00:56:17,090 --> 00:56:21,680
One of them's bit bossy and when I'm
in Bossy, it's not like she goes, okay,

1007
00:56:21,681 --> 00:56:24,700
you sit over here, we're playing this
game. She's like, don't touch that.

1008
00:56:24,701 --> 00:56:27,390
That's my toy. She's just
a bit of a con. Yeah,

1009
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:30,900
they don't like Conti.
So they're trying to get rid of Bossy,

1010
00:56:31,050 --> 00:56:32,400
which is a substitute for Conti.

1011
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:36,630
They're trying to remove themselves from
criticism or anybody who's coming up

1012
00:56:36,631 --> 00:56:37,050
with that.

1013
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:41,400
They're either trying to silence free
speech or they're trying to remove what

1014
00:56:41,401 --> 00:56:45,450
they think is criticism and they
faced many times and it's, you know,

1015
00:56:45,451 --> 00:56:48,990
a lot of them. Like what,
where's it coming from? Most
likely feminists and well,

1016
00:56:48,991 --> 00:56:50,010
what are a lot of feminists?

1017
00:56:50,011 --> 00:56:54,240
A lot of feminists are very strong women
who like being able to tell people what

1018
00:56:54,241 --> 00:56:57,960
the fuck to do and what, what would be
a criticism of that? Well, she's a con,

1019
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:01,070
she's Conti, she's bossy. Those are there.

1020
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:05,310
They're all in line with what's what
people don't like. I will ban Bossy,

1021
00:57:05,311 --> 00:57:08,510
get the fuck, am I in frame
his speech, he campaign,

1022
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:10,380
it's fuck this thing

1023
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:13,670
on their advert or the program.
The woman was there going,

1024
00:57:13,671 --> 00:57:18,230
do you know that men earn
99% of the world's property?

1025
00:57:18,830 --> 00:57:22,160
Right. And I, and then
I, I thought about it,

1026
00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:25,700
do you know 95% of the
homeless are also men?

1027
00:57:26,190 --> 00:57:31,190
This is plenty of Bossy bitches kicking
cans out of the houses I live in rent

1028
00:57:31,431 --> 00:57:34,790
free are nice guy.
All you ban Bossy,

1029
00:57:34,791 --> 00:57:36,590
you won't get women that
are heads of corporations.

1030
00:57:36,770 --> 00:57:40,730
Most bossy women that I've
known in my life don't have jobs

1031
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:44,870
and probably would never get to the head
of a corporation because that requires

1032
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:48,500
a lot of people skills. It's not like they
have been held back, bicycling, Bossy,

1033
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:52,360
I'm there paying the rent and they're
still fucking bossing me around. You know?

1034
00:57:52,370 --> 00:57:56,900
It doesn't feel like, yeah, no,
this, the idea is ridiculous.

1035
00:57:57,020 --> 00:58:00,020
The idea that all these women want to
have fucking want to be the head of

1036
00:58:00,021 --> 00:58:03,530
corporations is ridiculous too. A lot
of women don't want those jobs either.

1037
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:05,360
They're not working towards those jobs.

1038
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:08,120
The idea that they're completely
banned from those jobs.

1039
00:58:08,121 --> 00:58:12,590
There are women out there
who run corporations. Is it
fair? I'm not saying it is,

1040
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,390
but there's a lot of shit that's not fair.

1041
00:58:14,610 --> 00:58:17,390
My life is not fair. Will most, well,

1042
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:22,030
there's a good chance we'll have a
female president next or possible. Yeah.

1043
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:25,780
There's just very different
characteristics that
men have and women have.

1044
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,250
It's very different personalities,

1045
00:58:27,251 --> 00:58:30,770
almost inherent to having testosterone
and a Dick, but you don't have,

1046
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:36,540
it was a with the woman
and this is nothing against
women when they have a kid.

1047
00:58:37,291 --> 00:58:39,540
I'm not saying cause they take
nine months out of the workplace,

1048
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:43,050
although it's probably a problem, but I
didn't give a fuck when they have a kid,

1049
00:58:43,051 --> 00:58:44,820
their mind does change a little bit.

1050
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:48,990
They become less career driven for
a lot of them. Not all of them,

1051
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:52,870
but they do start going, I want to
spend time with this and Dah Dah Dah.

1052
00:58:52,890 --> 00:58:55,590
And then a man has to step up a
little bit more and work a bit. Huh.

1053
00:58:55,890 --> 00:58:58,590
I sometimes big garage,

1054
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:02,640
the amount I have to go on the road
and be away from my kids. So I was,

1055
00:59:02,641 --> 00:59:07,470
I can support the family. You know, I
feel like I miss out on something there.

1056
00:59:07,471 --> 00:59:09,270
I'd rather be home all the time with him.

1057
00:59:09,590 --> 00:59:11,660
Right. I know exactly what you mean. Um,

1058
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:16,900
I think everyone has a role and that
everyone's role is different depending on

1059
00:59:17,601 --> 00:59:20,330
the relationship, depending on where you
are in life, depending on everything.

1060
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:24,770
But the idea that it would should be
even for men and women is ridiculous.

1061
00:59:24,771 --> 00:59:27,020
The idea that anything
should be even as ridiculous.

1062
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:32,210
The only thing you should ask is for
no discrimination, no discrimination,

1063
00:59:32,211 --> 00:59:34,910
and that someone will be there,

1064
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,510
there'd be promoted based entirely
on how well they do what they do.

1065
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:40,010
Here's what the idea that,
yeah,

1066
00:59:40,011 --> 00:59:43,520
but the idea that like there should be
an equal amount of men and an equal out

1067
00:59:43,521 --> 00:59:45,830
of women in the same
position that I don't buy.

1068
00:59:45,831 --> 00:59:49,370
That doesn't make any sense to me
because there's a lot of jobs that men do

1069
00:59:49,371 --> 00:59:52,070
better than women and a lot of
jobs that women do better than men.

1070
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:53,210
It's just a fact.

1071
00:59:53,350 --> 00:59:56,290
And they've got Beyonce
and Congolese arise.

1072
00:59:56,410 --> 01:00:00,850
And who is the other bird that got a
Giulia? God is on the campaign as well.

1073
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:06,400
And then like Beyonce is dead
going, going, uh, I'm not bossy,

1074
01:00:06,401 --> 01:00:09,970
but I am the boss. I'm the queen.
What is it with black women?

1075
01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:15,180
And wanting to be the coin queen.
Latifa. Amen. The coin of the night.

1076
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,330
Men.
Men are always the king.

1077
01:00:16,430 --> 01:00:20,060
Black men like this is a lot of fighters
that call themselves king black.

1078
01:00:20,170 --> 01:00:23,050
All white men will call
themselves the king of the castle.

1079
01:00:23,051 --> 01:00:26,860
I'm the king of my home.
That's a universal mile
thing. We want to be the king.

1080
01:00:27,550 --> 01:00:31,390
Black women want to be queens and
watch six want wanna be princesses.

1081
01:00:32,530 --> 01:00:36,080
It's true, right? They don't even
want to be Queens. The only child

1082
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:40,230
shake that wants to be
the queen is the queen.

1083
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:44,280
Every,
every time you made a girl,

1084
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:47,730
I want to be have a princess because
they want to be taken care of and black

1085
01:00:47,731 --> 01:00:49,950
chicks alike.
I want to fucking own you.

1086
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:54,190
God, I'm the Queen. Well,

1087
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:56,420
that was the thing that
black men like the,

1088
01:00:56,430 --> 01:01:00,820
there was a big thing they used to say.
It was that we used to be kings. You know,

1089
01:01:00,821 --> 01:01:03,490
black man used to be kings. You know,
before we were slaves, we were king.

1090
01:01:06,090 --> 01:01:09,950
God, I rarely I little villages
and they didn't travel very far.

1091
01:01:10,310 --> 01:01:15,050
It was easy to be a king
when the population was 10
and it was you and the other

1092
01:01:15,051 --> 01:01:20,051
hot and you're like I'm queen or whatever
and fucking you go out with your spear

1093
01:01:20,641 --> 01:01:23,060
and you think, oh I'm the king of
this little tea cause it's still,

1094
01:01:23,061 --> 01:01:28,010
now they've got guys that are
driving taxis in the UK who was like,

1095
01:01:28,011 --> 01:01:30,740
I'm Prince of Dubai. Bubububuh
right. And you're like,

1096
01:01:30,741 --> 01:01:34,550
I'm fourth in line for the throne and
there's so many fucking kings over there.

1097
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,250
That's hilarious.
And it's so true.

1098
01:01:36,251 --> 01:01:38,900
If you really stop and think
about it like the, the,

1099
01:01:38,910 --> 01:01:41,890
the amount of people that's
probably directly in line.

1100
01:01:41,891 --> 01:01:44,230
We were talking about and we
were talking about being famous,

1101
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:47,920
that you don't want to be the king of
a place. It's too big. Yeah. You know,

1102
01:01:47,921 --> 01:01:50,050
like you don't want to be the
[inaudible] either had a Rome,

1103
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:51,460
there's too much shit going on.

1104
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:55,180
Even all these other countries be able
to overthrow. Yeah. Too much stress.

1105
01:01:55,181 --> 01:01:57,040
Everybody's looking to
kill you all the time.

1106
01:01:57,220 --> 01:02:00,230
But if you're the king of a fucking
small village, Eh, like you probably do,

1107
01:02:00,231 --> 01:02:03,160
I'm pretty good. He'd get all
the fish. Yeah, you're good.

1108
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:05,800
You got 10 wives or
whatever the hell you need.

1109
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:07,280
You gotta go and wives.

1110
01:02:07,310 --> 01:02:10,010
Occasionally you can go over to a
guy's house and just take a goat.

1111
01:02:10,990 --> 01:02:15,820
Yeah, it's a, it's a tribute who has to
pay, but if you'd like to head of England,

1112
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:20,070
God damn is a lot of pressure on you.
Well, that king. Yeah, that was a good

1113
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:22,710
film. I love, you know what
I like about King Ralph?

1114
01:02:22,770 --> 01:02:27,160
King Ralph is a movie where you know
they've worked backwards. They've gone.

1115
01:02:27,161 --> 01:02:29,880
All right. This is the prep.
You've come up with movie ideas.

1116
01:02:29,881 --> 01:02:32,400
Whenever you go with movie ideas,
you think of just the broad strokes.

1117
01:02:32,401 --> 01:02:37,260
So someone's going, okay, American guy
is the king of England and he's a Slob,

1118
01:02:37,261 --> 01:02:39,750
and he likes 10 pin bowling.
All right, that's what I've got.

1119
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:43,690
And then another guy's going, how do we
get rid of the royal family? I'm fuck.

1120
01:02:43,691 --> 01:02:46,620
I'm thinking, all right. And then
one of them is gone. I've got it.

1121
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:49,220
They're all standing in a
puddle and get a lecture.

1122
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:53,220
They're all similar.

1123
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:57,290
They had take a photo of the entire
or family at once they're there,

1124
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:00,540
they're standing in a bit of water,
the camera, it goes, falls over, light,

1125
01:03:00,541 --> 01:03:02,610
falls into the puddle and
they all get electric,

1126
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,950
electrified the death ls electrified,

1127
01:03:07,110 --> 01:03:10,050
and then obviously they
go through all the family,

1128
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:14,490
like can't find a single relative until
they find a fat guy from Milwaukee

1129
01:03:14,491 --> 01:03:16,480
called Ralph.
I don't know if he's from Milwaukee.

1130
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:19,650
It sounds like he was king graph.
I never saw that movie.

1131
01:03:19,890 --> 01:03:22,350
Peter I told was it was a good painter.
I told,

1132
01:03:24,210 --> 01:03:27,510
it's funny, I haven't seen
it. Have you seen it recently?

1133
01:03:28,130 --> 01:03:30,300
I tell you what I know and movies.

1134
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:34,470
I tell you what I watched three
days ago I watched the doors movie,

1135
01:03:34,530 --> 01:03:35,363
great fucking movie.

1136
01:03:35,530 --> 01:03:39,440
I don't know because I went and saw it
when I was [inaudible] 99 three or 1992

1137
01:03:39,450 --> 01:03:40,283
when that movie came out,

1138
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:44,580
I saw it in the cinema so that would've
made me 16 I was a kid from Australia.

1139
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:48,960
I had never heard a doors song,
but I knew it was hip to like the doors.

1140
01:03:48,961 --> 01:03:51,960
And so I went along and watched it and
it was all of a stone is a lot of cutting

1141
01:03:51,961 --> 01:03:53,910
back and forth and all this type of stuff.

1142
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:58,740
And I remember walking out of the cinema
being bought out of my skull at 15,

1143
01:03:59,310 --> 01:04:02,790
but then like still signed to my
friends. Like that was a cool movie, man,

1144
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,680
they're lying.
And then when I had,

1145
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:08,460
then when I heard like someone
didn't like the film, I was like,

1146
01:04:08,490 --> 01:04:09,780
you obviously didn't get it.

1147
01:04:09,810 --> 01:04:12,480
You obviously don't get what
Jim Morrison has to say.

1148
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:16,740
And now I watched it as an adult and
it's not as a, I enjoyed it more.

1149
01:04:16,741 --> 01:04:19,860
But my conclusion was that Jim
Morrison was a bit of a Dick.

1150
01:04:20,350 --> 01:04:22,840
He was definitely a bit of a Dick,
but he was also a guy,

1151
01:04:23,020 --> 01:04:26,110
just like we were talking about with,
uh, when we're talking about Lenny Bruce,

1152
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:29,890
he's living in a totally different era,
like breaking out in that era,

1153
01:04:29,891 --> 01:04:31,770
like doing what they were doing.
How many,

1154
01:04:32,490 --> 01:04:36,570
how many young Canadians have you met
the think they like a gym. Like a, yeah,

1155
01:04:36,571 --> 01:04:40,280
the things I'm saying and the
words I'm, you know. Yeah.

1156
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:43,490
You ever worked the punchline
Atlanta? Uh, yes, I have. Yes.

1157
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:46,310
Back Room. The green room has
a, someone wrote on the wall,

1158
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:47,690
quit trying to be Hicks.

1159
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:52,610
That's fucking brilliant.
It's brilliant because for a long time,

1160
01:04:52,611 --> 01:04:57,380
like especially after Hicks died when he
died in the UK, that's all I care about.

1161
01:04:57,410 --> 01:05:01,550
The heat stopped man. Yeah. And
I've actually, I like Bill Hicks,

1162
01:05:01,551 --> 01:05:06,551
but I've gone out of my way not to
watch him because I got kind of sick of

1163
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:10,220
anytime you did edgy comedy
you've got compared to him.

1164
01:05:10,221 --> 01:05:12,740
And I thought if I don't watch him
and you can't compare because I'm not

1165
01:05:12,741 --> 01:05:15,380
influenced, so I haven't,
you know what I mean? But,

1166
01:05:15,810 --> 01:05:18,310
well, that's a compliment. I don't think
people are meaning in a negative way.

1167
01:05:18,390 --> 01:05:19,890
Yeah, no, no. But it's,

1168
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:24,390
it just got to the stage where evidently
we were all trying to be Bill Hicks.

1169
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:26,970
Yeah. That's just an easy
criticism. That's like,

1170
01:05:26,971 --> 01:05:29,850
if you have an argument with a woman
and someone say, Oh, you hate women.

1171
01:05:30,050 --> 01:05:33,430
You hate all women. Like, you know,
you know that easy argument, you know,

1172
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:35,940
and if you're, you're edgy and
they want to dismiss you, oh,

1173
01:05:35,941 --> 01:05:38,340
you're just trying to be
hex [inaudible] dismissal.

1174
01:05:38,390 --> 01:05:42,980
My girlfriend's favorite argument is when
I'm telling her off about something is,

1175
01:05:43,030 --> 01:05:44,930
or when she's telling me or
whatever the argument is,

1176
01:05:45,410 --> 01:05:49,610
is the problem with you is you always
think you're right. And I always go,

1177
01:05:49,650 --> 01:05:52,520
did you say things that you think are
wrong? Is this what you fucking do?

1178
01:05:53,810 --> 01:05:56,930
Of course, I always think are
Mariah. Oh, I might not be right,

1179
01:05:57,290 --> 01:06:01,250
but these are my opinions. These are
what I therefore believe to be correct.

1180
01:06:01,310 --> 01:06:03,350
You just fucking sign things willy nilly.

1181
01:06:03,530 --> 01:06:07,400
So this is probably why we fought so much.
But yeah, I always believe him. Right?

1182
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:11,680
I think if you consider it deeply enough,
you should always believe you're right.

1183
01:06:11,710 --> 01:06:14,050
Yeah. Yeah. If you're just talking
off the top of your head. Yeah,

1184
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:17,430
yeah, yeah. I, I, I might be an
idiot, but I always think I'm right.

1185
01:06:17,670 --> 01:06:21,120
Yeah. I don't ever say anything that
I think is wrong. Several Times,

1186
01:06:21,140 --> 01:06:25,050
four times I am wrong.
But I don't know that before the fight.

1187
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:28,800
That's a very important point
that you don't know you're wrong,

1188
01:06:28,801 --> 01:06:32,940
but you are if someone's, but that I
have a real problem with that. When,

1189
01:06:32,970 --> 01:06:37,620
when someone realizes in the middle of
an argument that the wrong keep going.

1190
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:39,550
No, when they keep going. That's what I,

1191
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:42,940
I fucking hate that when you
hear him justifying it back then

1192
01:06:44,410 --> 01:06:47,900
is I was unset Dajay calls it in my shows,

1193
01:06:47,901 --> 01:06:50,570
the skinny kid out of the road trip I was,

1194
01:06:50,630 --> 01:06:55,630
he was singing along to a wanted
dead or alive by Bon Jovi.

1195
01:06:56,370 --> 01:06:58,430
I'm on it data La.

1196
01:06:59,130 --> 01:07:03,230
And then there's the line on
the steel horse I ride, right?

1197
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:06,830
Yeah. I always thought it was,
I'm going to steal the whole,

1198
01:07:06,831 --> 01:07:09,600
so I ride because he's a cowboy,
right?

1199
01:07:09,620 --> 01:07:13,370
It tends that he's riding on a motorcycle
and I haven't got the gist of this

1200
01:07:13,371 --> 01:07:17,030
song whatsoever. Right. And I
said, Oh, you got that wrong.

1201
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:20,330
I'm going to steal the horse, our
rod. And then he said, no, it's not.

1202
01:07:20,390 --> 01:07:23,480
And then I went, Nah, you wrong. I checked
it on the Internet and he was right,

1203
01:07:24,050 --> 01:07:25,130
but I didn't back down.

1204
01:07:26,330 --> 01:07:29,370
[inaudible]

1205
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:31,350
it's going for weeks about it.

1206
01:07:31,351 --> 01:07:34,020
You don't even know fucking song lyric
sticks is gone. You would upset him.

1207
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:38,000
Either one is fine. Steel horse
or steal the horse. I think steel,

1208
01:07:38,001 --> 01:07:41,810
the horse is more renegade.
Cowboy steal horses.

1209
01:07:42,170 --> 01:07:46,640
Any asshole can go buy a Harley Davidson.
I like, I like my lyrics better.

1210
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:50,750
It's better. It is better steel. The horse
I ride. That's some real renegade shit.

1211
01:07:51,020 --> 01:07:53,090
You're a fucking euro.
You're a horse thief.

1212
01:07:53,330 --> 01:07:54,190
There's a song.

1213
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:57,980
One of my favorite songs when Australian
Bank would you and why is called a

1214
01:07:57,981 --> 01:08:01,670
heavy hot and uh,
uh,

1215
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:03,850
there's a lyric that goes,
uh,

1216
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:07,450
now every tee shirts
got a white wine stain.

1217
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:10,060
I'm loving cigarettes again.
I know every June,

1218
01:08:10,061 --> 01:08:13,720
it's just about a guy been dumped right
now. Every teacher has got a Weinstein.

1219
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:18,080
I always thought it was, now every teacher
has a white stain and that's my legs.

1220
01:08:18,081 --> 01:08:20,450
Cause like he's been dumped.
So he's winking so much,

1221
01:08:20,670 --> 01:08:21,510
getting come everywhere.

1222
01:08:24,390 --> 01:08:27,810
And I think that's probably
better in a romantic song though.

1223
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:32,640
Teesha it's got a wide stain. I'm
loving secret restaurant Game Weinstein.

1224
01:08:32,940 --> 01:08:37,680
Come on now. Hold me closer Tony.
Danza yeah, that's a good, yeah.

1225
01:08:37,681 --> 01:08:39,540
Everybody used to have a bit about that.

1226
01:08:39,541 --> 01:08:42,870
And there was like one of
the early standup bits that
people used to have a bit

1227
01:08:42,871 --> 01:08:45,660
about people getting the, the, the
lyrics wrong. There was a bunch of guys

1228
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:48,630
where they used to have like the sheet
where they haven't written and they'd be

1229
01:08:48,631 --> 01:08:50,040
flipping over what they thought was right.

1230
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:53,710
No, no, no, no. Like they
would sing the wrong lyrics.

1231
01:08:53,711 --> 01:08:56,860
Like there's a few guys that had bits
and it would be a real problem if they

1232
01:08:56,861 --> 01:08:57,694
work together.

1233
01:08:58,260 --> 01:09:02,350
Like there's a few guys that had bits
about people getting the wrong Lucy in the

1234
01:09:02,351 --> 01:09:05,020
sky with diamonds. I
would come up with an, uh,

1235
01:09:05,530 --> 01:09:08,170
the wrong word for it and
they would have a whole thing.

1236
01:09:08,330 --> 01:09:12,380
I saw a lot of guys hold me close,
a tiny dancer and chunk.

1237
01:09:12,510 --> 01:09:14,430
That's Photoshop though. So, obviously

1238
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:19,740
I, there was a, um, uh, there,

1239
01:09:19,741 --> 01:09:23,500
there was a lot of guys, you would have
a pad and they'd ride up in Britain.

1240
01:09:23,501 --> 01:09:26,260
They'd write out all the lyrics
to songs like a, you know,

1241
01:09:26,261 --> 01:09:28,070
like that's something that was
probably like in satanic movies.

1242
01:09:30,710 --> 01:09:34,030
It's in Latin. Right. But he would write
out what he thought it was an English.

1243
01:09:34,031 --> 01:09:38,200
And then when you saw the words with
the music, he started to go, oh,

1244
01:09:38,201 --> 01:09:42,190
that is what they're saying, you know?
And then there was another one for that.

1245
01:09:42,191 --> 01:09:46,390
Michael Jackson, the Earth Song. What
about pat? What about us? That one,

1246
01:09:46,990 --> 01:09:49,840
no one knows what the fuck he's saying
and that he's just screaming around.

1247
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:53,200
And that was very popular in Britain
for them to go, oh, these are the words.

1248
01:09:53,201 --> 01:09:57,610
I think it's, yeah, it's kind of hacky.
It's kind of hacky. Yeah. But I'm not,

1249
01:09:58,090 --> 01:09:59,530
I don't mind a guy.

1250
01:09:59,890 --> 01:10:04,030
There's occasionally you'd get like this
song parody guys that are really shit,

1251
01:10:04,570 --> 01:10:07,150
most of them is shit. But occasionally
you'll get a guy where you go, oh,

1252
01:10:07,151 --> 01:10:11,470
he's all right. Him just out
of nowhere. It's like anything,
if you, if you, if you,

1253
01:10:11,471 --> 01:10:14,620
even if you do something shit,
if you do it extraordinarily well,

1254
01:10:15,070 --> 01:10:15,903
that it can be good.

1255
01:10:16,010 --> 01:10:16,550
Well,

1256
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:20,480
it sucks for a guide like weird Al
Yankovic who was like one of the first guy

1257
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:24,060
who does it. He does it very good
and just doesn't change the lyrics.

1258
01:10:24,061 --> 01:10:28,490
He gives a whole new story. It's
like he does that, uh, that, that,

1259
01:10:28,710 --> 01:10:32,970
uh, um, offs, offspring song.
I'm pretty fly for a rabbi

1260
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:38,730
and it's just all about this
guy and he's in, he's in,

1261
01:10:38,731 --> 01:10:41,880
he's rabbi plays and he's
in a synagogue and you know,

1262
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:43,540
it is a weird thing.
No one,

1263
01:10:43,541 --> 01:10:46,360
someone else creates the foundation
for what you're doing. You know,

1264
01:10:46,361 --> 01:10:47,860
whenever you're doing
a parody of something,

1265
01:10:47,861 --> 01:10:51,370
someone else creates a foundation and
then you come along and build comedy on

1266
01:10:51,371 --> 01:10:55,480
the foundation of whatever they're doing.
Like, I'm fat from, I'm bad. You know,

1267
01:10:55,481 --> 01:10:59,290
you were at to
get the same outfit on

1268
01:11:00,110 --> 01:11:02,150
first guy to really,
uh,

1269
01:11:02,151 --> 01:11:05,210
he used to get the rights from people
like for the film clips and everything.

1270
01:11:05,211 --> 01:11:06,830
People were used to like
it when they did it. Oh,

1271
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:11,860
I'm sure at the moment I've been told
that Dana Carvey does an impersonation of

1272
01:11:14,071 --> 01:11:16,020
me.
I desperately want to see it.

1273
01:11:16,130 --> 01:11:17,480
Dana Carvey doesn't impersonation.

1274
01:11:17,790 --> 01:11:18,960
Yeah,
like it's CIA.

1275
01:11:18,961 --> 01:11:22,380
The agents we said we just had done in
coffee doesn't impersonation of you were

1276
01:11:22,381 --> 01:11:24,390
all cracking up and I
think he does it on stage,

1277
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:28,740
but he was just doing it for the other
agents down at sea and then I think they

1278
01:11:28,741 --> 01:11:31,620
thought that I'd be like, what the
fuck is that? Can't do. And I was like,

1279
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:36,510
fuck all I want to know and how it
is what it looks like I want to,

1280
01:11:36,511 --> 01:11:39,690
I want to see. Then it can be, he's
like one of the best impersonators ever.

1281
01:11:40,050 --> 01:11:43,690
Yeah, that's, that's cool.
That's cool that he's doing
an impersonation. Yeah. Wow.

1282
01:11:43,870 --> 01:11:44,540
That's a good sign.

1283
01:11:44,540 --> 01:11:45,910
That's a good sign. Yeah. He's,

1284
01:11:45,990 --> 01:11:50,330
he's one of these guys that I always
think maybe he just didn't want to do

1285
01:11:50,331 --> 01:11:53,630
movies anymore because you just
leave it up in San Francisco now.

1286
01:11:53,631 --> 01:11:57,050
He plays clubs every weekend and stuff
like that, but does he? Yeah. I thought,

1287
01:11:57,051 --> 01:11:59,000
I think as you do a lot of stand up.
Yeah,

1288
01:11:59,001 --> 01:12:02,780
but I think he does it like in a club
down the road from his house where he goes

1289
01:12:02,781 --> 01:12:06,620
every week and it's packed out. You know
what I mean? Like he's just that guy.

1290
01:12:06,710 --> 01:12:10,430
What's fine out. Yeah. He was, I think
he was at the Ice House recently. Really?

1291
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:16,550
Aye. Aye Man. He's
[inaudible] films where like,

1292
01:12:16,690 --> 01:12:20,110
like Wayne's world know that we're
like a big deal for me. Yeah, me too.

1293
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:23,140
I think I saw Wayne's world
more than any movie ever.

1294
01:12:23,250 --> 01:12:25,390
My life. Oh, he's doing
a bunch of theaters.

1295
01:12:25,450 --> 01:12:30,450
He's doing a San well casino and he's
doing the Ip casino resort and spies doing

1296
01:12:33,701 --> 01:12:38,310
like, you know, smaller casinos.
But maybe he's doing, you know,

1297
01:12:38,530 --> 01:12:40,490
he just mostly works up there and then

1298
01:12:40,540 --> 01:12:44,530
I wa I want to put him in legit. I'll
say a fee. If we get a third season.

1299
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:48,910
I don't want to put him in. I am
doing an impression of you. Yeah.

1300
01:12:48,911 --> 01:12:51,970
Maybe that could be the reason.
Like I can see him on TV doing in person.

1301
01:12:51,971 --> 01:12:54,790
They send me, I go to confront him or
something. It would be a cool episode.

1302
01:12:54,970 --> 01:12:58,300
Like if I was a bit arrogant and all upset
and I was on coke when I was watching

1303
01:12:58,810 --> 01:13:01,450
the episode where he was
doing that or the TV spot.

1304
01:13:01,550 --> 01:13:03,500
I think for a guy like him,
you know,

1305
01:13:03,501 --> 01:13:07,390
I bet it's probably really a nice thing
to do to just be able to do theaters.

1306
01:13:07,391 --> 01:13:11,960
Yeah. Just do his gig on the weekends
and then go places and not having anybody

1307
01:13:11,961 --> 01:13:14,880
telling him, you know, Oh our
movie got funded. Uh, the,

1308
01:13:14,881 --> 01:13:18,620
the production company wants to
change something about your show or

1309
01:13:19,130 --> 01:13:22,820
it's like, it's like my PR person
wanted to come along to me with this,

1310
01:13:22,821 --> 01:13:25,520
cause I didn't book it and went, Oh, we
should come along to everything. I'm like,

1311
01:13:25,521 --> 01:13:29,810
I've done Joe's podcast before.
Just fine getting there by myself.

1312
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:30,101
Oh,

1313
01:13:30,101 --> 01:13:33,430
pay PR people are disgusting when people
bring him and they start talking to me.

1314
01:13:33,460 --> 01:13:37,090
Um, you know, like what, what he
needs to do is if the fuck outta here,

1315
01:13:37,450 --> 01:13:40,930
get the fuck outta here. You can't talk
for him. What did that let that guy,

1316
01:13:40,931 --> 01:13:44,230
there's a reason why he's here
and not you. He's, he's a talker.

1317
01:13:44,410 --> 01:13:46,100
This is a comedian or
she or whoever the fuck,

1318
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:48,810
it's a very odd occupation.
The Po,

1319
01:13:48,970 --> 01:13:52,440
because they're confused everybody
else that you have employed,

1320
01:13:52,470 --> 01:13:57,180
you can sort of exactly tell where the
money's coming from. Your agent books,

1321
01:13:57,190 --> 01:14:00,490
the gigs and you manage it gets you to,
you can sorta go quintessential. You.

1322
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:05,050
You can justify that, but with
PR it's just like, I dunno.

1323
01:14:05,051 --> 01:14:08,280
Is that worth the money? I don't know.
I did. I did. I get anything out of it.

1324
01:14:08,281 --> 01:14:10,410
Is My life better? I don't. I'm
not sure what happened there.

1325
01:14:10,930 --> 01:14:13,960
Some of them are real good. Some of
them are really good at it. You know,

1326
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:16,930
I have a good publicist.
He gets it like if I need to do things,

1327
01:14:16,931 --> 01:14:18,440
he can get me those things here.

1328
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:20,980
I want to promote something
to Gig or what have you,

1329
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:25,210
but the bad ones are the ones that tell
the clients what to say and what to do

1330
01:14:25,211 --> 01:14:28,540
and where to don't don't talk about
this. Remember, don't don't do this.

1331
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:32,440
Don't do that. You can ever do that
with a comic, comics should do.

1332
01:14:32,690 --> 01:14:36,190
Most likely the mistake that you think
that they're going to make would be one

1333
01:14:36,191 --> 01:14:39,490
of the best things they could do. Like
you telling them not to say something.

1334
01:14:39,491 --> 01:14:42,370
If they wind up saying it
and it becomes hilarious,

1335
01:14:42,371 --> 01:14:44,500
a big uproar and the network gets pissed.

1336
01:14:44,620 --> 01:14:46,060
It's probably the best
thing they could ever do.

1337
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:48,970
I got in trouble yesterday,
a couple of weeks ago,

1338
01:14:48,971 --> 01:14:53,470
and Opie and Anthony just ringing in and
I had to have my publicist check that I

1339
01:14:53,471 --> 01:14:57,660
didn't fuck everything up in my life
because Carrie fishes in the season,

1340
01:14:57,670 --> 01:14:58,503
it legit.

1341
01:14:58,630 --> 01:15:03,550
And so I chatted to Carrie Fisher for a
wall and Carrie Fisher told me a little

1342
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:06,880
bit about what she was doing and star
wars and I didn't think it was a big

1343
01:15:06,881 --> 01:15:08,830
secret.
And I was talking to him.

1344
01:15:10,570 --> 01:15:12,290
What was it

1345
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:18,540
like on Star Wars for homes and web pages?
Went fucking mental look.

1346
01:15:18,541 --> 01:15:22,500
Jim Jefferies just spilled the beans on
the new star wars, Phil. Oh, not at all.

1347
01:15:22,510 --> 01:15:24,380
I was like, ah, fuck this.

1348
01:15:24,381 --> 01:15:28,180
The last fucking bit of Mafia in
this town that I need going after me.

1349
01:15:28,181 --> 01:15:33,181
The people who were in charge of tis
and 20th century Fox and Disney once

1350
01:15:33,490 --> 01:15:37,380
teaming up to ruin my career.
So she told you a secret nerd?

1351
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:40,900
She didn't give me a big check. He, oh,
she said, well, she said, ah. She said,

1352
01:15:40,930 --> 01:15:45,910
said to me, she goes, Oh, I'm gonna film
star wars sort of January through to July.

1353
01:15:45,911 --> 01:15:50,090
And I sit on Opie and Anthony. I
go, wow. And it was nasty. I got,

1354
01:15:50,170 --> 01:15:54,580
she kind of helped you having a small
role because she's there for that many

1355
01:15:54,580 --> 01:15:54,581
months.

1356
01:15:54,581 --> 01:15:59,581
So like I imagine that that we got to see
her Luke Skywalker and Han Solo in the

1357
01:16:00,371 --> 01:16:03,280
whole film, you know, which,

1358
01:16:03,310 --> 01:16:08,050
which many people were speculating
that they'll just have a cameo. Right.

1359
01:16:08,110 --> 01:16:10,090
And I was saying,
well that amount of time,

1360
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:13,570
and I thought maybe this was
information that everyone already knew.

1361
01:16:14,470 --> 01:16:17,980
I didn't know that I was,
I had some secret,

1362
01:16:18,010 --> 01:16:22,690
I can say it again here
because I'm already in trouble.
Right. She was the one who

1363
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:26,630
fucked up by telling you, you're going to
tell someone something. That's a secret.

1364
01:16:26,631 --> 01:16:29,090
You've got to say, hey, you
can't tell anybody this.

1365
01:16:29,250 --> 01:16:30,660
Well,
I didn't know if it was a secret.

1366
01:16:30,661 --> 01:16:32,190
I don't know if it's just
been blown out of proportion,

1367
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:36,840
but they say that episode seven is a
continuation of episode six. I'm like,

1368
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:41,730
Eh, it's got to have to be a
38 gap between these things.

1369
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:47,120
Unless something happened with the
force where everyone I age really fast.

1370
01:16:47,650 --> 01:16:52,310
They lost me 100% a few years back.
It's like the first couple of star wars,

1371
01:16:52,311 --> 01:16:54,320
the for the original few,
pretty good.

1372
01:16:54,620 --> 01:16:58,880
And then when they took that gap and then
came back was in the eighties the late

1373
01:16:58,880 --> 01:16:59,900
eighties when they
started doing them again

1374
01:17:00,030 --> 01:17:05,010
because the phantom menace
was a lighter than that man.

1375
01:17:05,011 --> 01:17:09,710
That was like 19 no, 2000 I was
at university. Was it really?

1376
01:17:09,740 --> 01:17:10,190
Yeah.

1377
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:14,090
Okay. Well, wherever it was, I was
like, man, this is just not star wars.

1378
01:17:14,091 --> 01:17:18,950
That was the height of my ecstasy
taking and I, I was that stupid thing.

1379
01:17:18,951 --> 01:17:21,250
When you get so into pills
where you're like, oh,

1380
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:25,360
we're going to see star wars and we'll
be on ecstasy because it's like someone's

1381
01:17:25,370 --> 01:17:28,580
just spent $1 billion in special effects
and that's still not good enough for my

1382
01:17:28,581 --> 01:17:32,930
mind anymore. I need to see it. What is
it like to see that movie on ecstasy?

1383
01:17:32,931 --> 01:17:35,520
Do you forgive them more?
I saw it.

1384
01:17:35,521 --> 01:17:37,820
The phone I started the first
time I'd actually to see,

1385
01:17:37,821 --> 01:17:39,800
and I remember saying to
people as we walked out,

1386
01:17:39,801 --> 01:17:44,690
best star wars ever when I
went and saw it two more times,

1387
01:17:45,530 --> 01:17:49,490
and also it didn't like adjust after the
drugs wore off because I'd been telling

1388
01:17:49,491 --> 01:17:50,900
everyone all that week,
you've got to see it.

1389
01:17:50,901 --> 01:17:55,490
It's better than the original star
wars is. Oh No. Cause the pod cast,

1390
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:58,220
the Pod, the pod thing, not the podcast.

1391
01:17:58,221 --> 01:18:01,220
The pod racing blew my fucking mind.

1392
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:04,280
Charter banks,

1393
01:18:04,310 --> 01:18:09,310
he is awesome and I smell an Oscar to
remember how bad that character was.

1394
01:18:10,161 --> 01:18:13,490
Everybody was angry. You know, always
bad about those new films where,

1395
01:18:13,550 --> 01:18:17,090
and I don't know if George is just
an idiot, but little bit racist,

1396
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:22,700
a little jar jar Binks was obviously
like a black sort of slave woman from a,

1397
01:18:22,701 --> 01:18:27,200
like a gone with the wind style fill and
a black actor. Yeah, pull up the jar,

1398
01:18:27,210 --> 01:18:30,000
jar Binks. But the way
he talk video, Misa,

1399
01:18:31,150 --> 01:18:35,810
Misa gonna to help you out to me said,
and he was like, just fucking Sean,

1400
01:18:35,811 --> 01:18:39,610
my shoes and fuck off. Like it was that
level of racism that we're putting in it.

1401
01:18:39,890 --> 01:18:44,540
And then they made the, the guys
who were the trade embargo people,

1402
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:48,920
they will like Nazi s Japanese people.
They were like,

1403
01:18:49,190 --> 01:18:53,910
you have no section here in this
part of the galaxy like that.

1404
01:18:53,930 --> 01:18:58,850
Right. Hold up a video, pull up a video.
I want to hear you do it. Yeah, no, it's,

1405
01:18:58,851 --> 01:19:02,990
it's uh, my bell or whatever.
Well that's interesting man.

1406
01:19:02,991 --> 01:19:06,710
I never even thought about it. And then
the goodies all had British accent,

1407
01:19:06,740 --> 01:19:07,850
all the jet noise.
We're like,

1408
01:19:07,851 --> 01:19:10,990
we have hosted the realm of the things
we do today and then you'll cannot come

1409
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:15,260
into our 20 [inaudible]. Right. So
it was like an all the, all the,

1410
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:19,820
all the gang guns were like light back.
Jim, Mike installed black people in the,

1411
01:19:19,821 --> 01:19:22,070
in the end of the film where
they were all like hippies.

1412
01:19:22,071 --> 01:19:26,240
Just did is that thing that we do when
we have a language that we want to be

1413
01:19:26,241 --> 01:19:28,770
noble,
we give it an English accent or villains.

1414
01:19:28,790 --> 01:19:32,820
They're good at villains or romantic
leads, English accent. When you hear

1415
01:19:35,650 --> 01:19:38,080
why is this music playing in
the background? Cause there's,

1416
01:19:38,110 --> 01:19:40,950
I think most of the videos would charge
our banks has been taken off for you too.

1417
01:19:40,970 --> 01:19:42,070
But this one's awesome.

1418
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:51,720
Misa Misa,

1419
01:19:54,580 --> 01:19:55,413
Robin

1420
01:19:59,410 --> 01:20:01,770
stepping on dog,

1421
01:20:01,850 --> 01:20:05,840
he always has to walk 10
steps behind this whole weird,

1422
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:13,530
the music is killing me.

1423
01:20:14,410 --> 01:20:18,460
He was the first like fully CGI
person in cinema in the technology.

1424
01:20:18,461 --> 01:20:22,030
Just was a few years off because then
they sort of nailed it with Gollum.

1425
01:20:22,510 --> 01:20:27,100
Well they can make it, the thing about
these guys like George our banks is,

1426
01:20:27,101 --> 01:20:28,300
it's not a real thing.

1427
01:20:28,420 --> 01:20:30,880
So you don't compare it to a real
thing and it doesn't fuck with you.

1428
01:20:30,881 --> 01:20:34,590
Like a real lion looks way
different than a CGI line.

1429
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:36,460
Oh yeah.
The way they move it's like,

1430
01:20:36,580 --> 01:20:39,880
but like Godzilla is probably
going to look fucking bad.

1431
01:20:39,881 --> 01:20:42,160
Ass Lizards and stuff looked really good.
But I,

1432
01:20:42,430 --> 01:20:44,890
I always say don't CGI clothes.

1433
01:20:45,970 --> 01:20:50,970
As soon as you did CGI clothing on
[inaudible] the material doesn't flows to

1434
01:20:51,161 --> 01:20:55,330
smoothly. Like it's water or something.
It doesn't ruffle like a real shirt.

1435
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:58,120
Like Yoda look cool as a puppet.

1436
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:02,590
He was more believable as a up
cause he existed. Yes. And now Yoda,

1437
01:21:02,591 --> 01:21:06,190
it's like with these flowing cloak
that he comes in with, it just doesn't,

1438
01:21:06,191 --> 01:21:07,330
that's what takes me out of it.
Yeah.

1439
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:07,541
Yeah.

1440
01:21:07,541 --> 01:21:12,040
That's the argument that special effects
guys have for using makeup and like

1441
01:21:12,041 --> 01:21:13,840
Richard, you know like the, the, the,

1442
01:21:13,841 --> 01:21:17,500
the type of special effects
that they used in star wars.

1443
01:21:17,740 --> 01:21:20,380
The original star wars
saw like the same shit.

1444
01:21:20,381 --> 01:21:23,500
They use an American Werewolf in London,
like rubber and you know,

1445
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:26,950
hair and they the, it's all special
effects guys, but it's really,

1446
01:21:27,010 --> 01:21:30,460
Rick Baker was like the main
guy. But yeah, it's a real thing.

1447
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:34,750
Whereas like if you're looking at
hair is a big one, like flowing hair,

1448
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:37,300
any flowing hair with CGI looks like shit.

1449
01:21:37,470 --> 01:21:41,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's not, yeah,
unless it's like in a CGI world,

1450
01:21:41,611 --> 01:21:45,020
like a Pixar film where everyone's
fucking, exactly. Yeah. Like A,

1451
01:21:45,050 --> 01:21:48,000
it's standing next to another
person. You're like, Eh,

1452
01:21:48,180 --> 01:21:50,400
it's not real. Yeah. It's
not, they're not ready yet.

1453
01:21:50,430 --> 01:21:53,130
Animals are not ready at the
wolves and game of Thrones,

1454
01:21:53,131 --> 01:21:54,280
those dire wolves or like

1455
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:58,200
we got, uh, we got John
Ratzenberger on the sh on my show.

1456
01:21:58,201 --> 01:22:02,520
He plays one of the dads, right.
Cliff climbing from cheese. Ah, great.

1457
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:06,390
Now I can always tell the age of a girl,
like,

1458
01:22:06,391 --> 01:22:07,410
I don't cheat on my girlfriend anything.

1459
01:22:07,411 --> 01:22:09,630
But I always think if when
these girls were extras,

1460
01:22:09,631 --> 01:22:11,550
I have one light on the thing.
I always, you always think,

1461
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:13,560
I wonder if I could have fucked
her. You know, that's our whole,

1462
01:22:13,590 --> 01:22:15,570
all your life is like this.
Right, right. Of course.

1463
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:20,960
I was talking to one go thinking thing
and she was cute and then this is the way

1464
01:22:21,181 --> 01:22:24,030
I gauge a girl,
whether she's too young for me where the,

1465
01:22:24,031 --> 01:22:28,770
when she's talking to John Ratzenberger
does she know him as I cliff from cheese

1466
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:31,680
or be the pig from toy story

1467
01:22:33,710 --> 01:22:37,160
and as she's never heard of
cheers and he goes, oh yeah,

1468
01:22:37,230 --> 01:22:39,310
mammy the pig from toy story.
Yeah.

1469
01:22:39,311 --> 01:22:42,450
I get them quick buzz Lightyear
if he does all that and they go,

1470
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:46,380
oh I know who you are. You Go, okay, you
can't go near that girl that's too young.

1471
01:22:47,810 --> 01:22:48,330
Okay

1472
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:53,010
so young. It's like actually
you must have seen cheese once.

1473
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:56,190
A lot of people haven't. You
know why? Cause kids did.

1474
01:22:56,191 --> 01:23:00,300
I don't see anything old because
they've got too many channels options.

1475
01:23:00,330 --> 01:23:04,320
It's true new shows to catch up on.
I used to see every,

1476
01:23:04,321 --> 01:23:06,090
I seen all the advocates size,
Maren

1477
01:23:06,090 --> 01:23:08,290
impact kettle films,
Everly Shirley temple movie.

1478
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:11,030
Cause my mother liked these old black
and white films and they were on a Sunday

1479
01:23:11,031 --> 01:23:12,730
and we only had four
channels in the one TV.

1480
01:23:12,731 --> 01:23:15,130
So I had to fucking sit and
watch these films. Right.

1481
01:23:15,131 --> 01:23:19,690
Because I didn't go out of the House
for whatever reason. Now the kids today,

1482
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:23,320
they've got their own, you know,
you got to wake up for a cartoon.

1483
01:23:24,190 --> 01:23:27,290
Remember you had to the cartoon, was
it Sunday? You had to wake up for it.

1484
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:29,750
I remember that Shit.
Now you can DVR it.

1485
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:32,710
Plus you've got a cartoon channel and
then when you get a bit older you've got

1486
01:23:32,711 --> 01:23:35,950
this channel. It's sort of caters
to you being a fucking moron.

1487
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:40,060
The Nickelodeon one where it's like
now like you're grown up a little bit.

1488
01:23:40,061 --> 01:23:42,760
We're still going to keep your children
when the kids should be stopped watching

1489
01:23:42,761 --> 01:23:45,430
more adults sort of dry
already type things.

1490
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:49,450
There's now they're watching fucking
Miley Cyrus or Hannah Montana or all that

1491
01:23:49,451 --> 01:23:50,284
type of shit.

1492
01:23:50,390 --> 01:23:53,570
Have you ever seen nick at nite
or Nick Moms? They have nick.

1493
01:23:53,830 --> 01:23:56,050
Nick Mom's stand after
dark. Yeah, they're,

1494
01:23:56,060 --> 01:23:59,280
they have the mum's doing stand
up about being a mom. Yeah.

1495
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:03,320
I guess it works for them, you know,
I'm not hating or anything but,

1496
01:24:03,550 --> 01:24:05,680
but it seems like a
very restrictive thing.

1497
01:24:06,070 --> 01:24:11,070
It's like I once did an atheist convention
in front of like 5,000 people in

1498
01:24:11,111 --> 01:24:13,480
Australia and I was booked to do it.
And as I said,

1499
01:24:13,481 --> 01:24:17,200
why Uttama jags after they'd done this
is the only time I brought back old jokes

1500
01:24:17,201 --> 01:24:19,810
in recent times because I
had to do a 40 minutes set.

1501
01:24:20,330 --> 01:24:24,580
It had to be all religious stuff and I
have 40 minutes or religious stuff over

1502
01:24:24,581 --> 01:24:27,520
the course of all my specials.
Yeah. But never at one.

1503
01:24:27,521 --> 01:24:31,690
So I actually sat on looking
myself up on youtube going, oh,

1504
01:24:31,691 --> 01:24:33,750
that's how that bit goes. All right,
let's have a bit. That'd be great.

1505
01:24:33,751 --> 01:24:36,480
So I could just do a
religious fucking set.

1506
01:24:36,790 --> 01:24:39,920
A 40 minute religious set. Yeah.
How do you keep yourself from your,

1507
01:24:39,930 --> 01:24:42,010
like repeating the same sort of a theme?

1508
01:24:42,110 --> 01:24:44,440
Wow. Well, I've done a
lot of religious books,

1509
01:24:44,441 --> 01:24:47,110
but there was a little bit of cheating
going on in the sense that I'd go,

1510
01:24:47,590 --> 01:24:52,210
I'd go a fucking, these Catholics
don't like people wearing condoms,

1511
01:24:52,211 --> 01:24:55,240
do they? Anyway? I fucked
a chick without a condom.

1512
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:59,110
[inaudible] wasn't a religious routine,

1513
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:02,940
but there was some definite,
yeah,

1514
01:25:02,980 --> 01:25:06,340
there was some dressing up of other
jokes to make them look like they were

1515
01:25:06,341 --> 01:25:09,580
religious. That's funny. But when you do,

1516
01:25:10,330 --> 01:25:12,850
when you meet that many atheists guy,
the atheist community,

1517
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:16,140
not a good looking bunch. Not a lot
of sexy atheists. I don't know why.

1518
01:25:16,150 --> 01:25:20,770
A lot of redundancy to la and as I said
at my opening line was look at this

1519
01:25:20,771 --> 01:25:22,570
5,000 people talking about nothing

1520
01:25:24,790 --> 01:25:26,860
like this is a lot of effort
to talk about nothing.

1521
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:30,170
Well, if you ever heard of
atheism plus, what's that? Oh,

1522
01:25:30,350 --> 01:25:31,220
this is where it gets rough.

1523
01:25:31,490 --> 01:25:36,380
It's atheism plus a set of
core ethical and moral values.

1524
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:41,090
So it's like, you know,
antidiscrimination antiracism atheist,

1525
01:25:41,091 --> 01:25:42,910
like essentially it's a religion,

1526
01:25:42,911 --> 01:25:47,090
a religion based on a
type of anti religion,

1527
01:25:47,210 --> 01:25:49,340
but you still know how to do these things.

1528
01:25:49,341 --> 01:25:52,780
You should have your own code
inherently in you as a human being.

1529
01:25:52,860 --> 01:25:57,540
I call it de, yeah, atheism.
Pluses, Duh, Duh. Don't be racist.

1530
01:25:57,650 --> 01:25:59,130
Duh.
Don't be homophobic.

1531
01:25:59,131 --> 01:26:04,131
I think it's certain point in time when
enough interest information gets like,

1532
01:26:04,730 --> 01:26:08,570
okay, like for instance this group, okay,
the four people that are in this room,

1533
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:12,320
if you want to start preaching to
the four people in this room that you

1534
01:26:12,321 --> 01:26:14,490
shouldn't be homophobic or
you shouldn't be racist.

1535
01:26:14,491 --> 01:26:19,250
Like to us with no point other than just
espousing your beliefs. We'd be like,

1536
01:26:19,251 --> 01:26:22,730
Duh. Of course with the fuck he's
saying, unless there's some humor to it.

1537
01:26:22,970 --> 01:26:26,840
You just repeating some shit that
everybody with a fucking brain and a heart

1538
01:26:26,841 --> 01:26:30,800
agrees with. Like why? Why would you
be sexist? Why would you be homophobic?

1539
01:26:30,801 --> 01:26:31,620
Why would you

1540
01:26:31,620 --> 01:26:32,470
all this symbol.

1541
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:37,180
Simple fundamental things that that
decide whether you can be friends with a

1542
01:26:37,181 --> 01:26:40,510
person. Just the the, the bit where
these are deal breakers for me.

1543
01:26:40,511 --> 01:26:42,260
If you're a homophobic
or racist or whatever,

1544
01:26:42,690 --> 01:26:44,530
I think you're a cock if
you're any of these things.

1545
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:46,940
And then there's the other
things like I'm anti gun.

1546
01:26:46,970 --> 01:26:49,090
I have a lot of people who are pro gun,
you know what I mean?

1547
01:26:49,091 --> 01:26:52,790
That's something that's just open
to fucking argument on the bipolar.

1548
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:56,290
It's not a deal closer when it comes
to being a friend. Right? Absolutely.

1549
01:26:56,530 --> 01:26:59,710
And then, yeah, and then we
of course, we all hate women.

1550
01:27:01,370 --> 01:27:03,100
We're all on the same page with that one.
Right.

1551
01:27:04,510 --> 01:27:08,080
The antidepressant one is one that I,
I leave open to debate.

1552
01:27:08,120 --> 01:27:12,400
I have people that I'm friends with that
we'll go on this big rants about how

1553
01:27:12,401 --> 01:27:15,940
evil antidepressants are.
And then I have friends that are on them.

1554
01:27:16,150 --> 01:27:20,230
Oh, I've, I've used them and I've
found that have helped me in my life.

1555
01:27:20,460 --> 01:27:23,160
You used them and you got off of
them? Yes. Why did you get off of him?

1556
01:27:24,110 --> 01:27:27,350
I probably should stay on them,
but I'm of the opinion in life,

1557
01:27:27,380 --> 01:27:31,310
it's better to be taking nothing into
your body. Medicine wise. You know,

1558
01:27:31,311 --> 01:27:34,040
there's other things you should take,
vitamins or whatever,

1559
01:27:34,041 --> 01:27:37,970
but I feel like if you can get
away with it and not take it,

1560
01:27:37,971 --> 01:27:39,350
it's probably better in the long term.

1561
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:44,170
Have you ever fucked around with five
HTP? What's that? Five HTP is, um,

1562
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:47,080
it's the building blocks
for Serotonin and you,

1563
01:27:47,081 --> 01:27:52,081
you could take it in a supplement form
and five HTP actually helps your body

1564
01:27:52,811 --> 01:27:55,090
produce more Serotonin,
makes you feel better.

1565
01:27:55,230 --> 01:27:58,830
Alright. I'd be definitely up
for something like that. I, uh,

1566
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:00,300
for me it's,

1567
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:05,600
I've been on any depression sometimes
there was some that was a big tragic event

1568
01:28:05,881 --> 01:28:07,240
happening in my life
and I could just have,

1569
01:28:07,260 --> 01:28:09,900
may have to pull my shit together a
couple of times that have happened in the

1570
01:28:09,901 --> 01:28:10,531
last time I was,

1571
01:28:10,531 --> 01:28:15,531
I was just suffering from depression
and it just wasn't fucking shifting.

1572
01:28:15,740 --> 01:28:19,740
You know, I've been hitting
head. Yeah. How many times? Um,

1573
01:28:20,790 --> 01:28:23,290
one major.
So like high school a few times,

1574
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:25,540
but one major time as an adult like this,

1575
01:28:25,541 --> 01:28:28,950
there's a infamous video of
me getting punched on stage,

1576
01:28:28,951 --> 01:28:31,080
but that one didn't actually hurt.
That was just a little dinger.

1577
01:28:31,620 --> 01:28:34,740
But one time I got off stage a Nottingham,

1578
01:28:34,741 --> 01:28:39,240
England and no hint that the Gig had gone
badly or heckles or anything like that.

1579
01:28:39,660 --> 01:28:42,630
And a guy came up and grabbed me from the
back of their head and smashed my head

1580
01:28:42,631 --> 01:28:47,100
into a table and I fractured my
skull above the bridge of my nose.

1581
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:51,030
Why did he do that? I, I'm never
quite sure I was knocked out,

1582
01:28:51,031 --> 01:28:54,840
like put the rest of the
guide. Um, from what I heard,

1583
01:28:54,841 --> 01:28:58,320
the security roughed him up and the
British government gave me $10,000 in

1584
01:28:58,321 --> 01:29:02,010
conference. I 10,000 pounds
in compensation. But you
got unconscious, Huh?

1585
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:05,910
And I wake up in the hospital. Yeah.
Fuck that one. It was like one of these,

1586
01:29:05,911 --> 01:29:06,541
one hit is,

1587
01:29:06,541 --> 01:29:11,040
but also I was facing the
other direction and it was,

1588
01:29:11,070 --> 01:29:14,490
it was really a, and this is what
I was saying, cause I ain't look,

1589
01:29:14,491 --> 01:29:15,660
this is one of the debates are getting,

1590
01:29:15,661 --> 01:29:19,800
I'm all for public health care and I'm
saying that as someone who's got money

1591
01:29:19,801 --> 01:29:24,570
and would pay for my private health care
on top of that. Anyway, uh, in Britain,

1592
01:29:24,571 --> 01:29:29,310
man, they put me in a hospital. They
never checked one name. They might. Sure.

1593
01:29:29,311 --> 01:29:30,750
I was, oh, fucking well and good.

1594
01:29:30,751 --> 01:29:33,000
And then they just left me and
I wasn't a citizen or nothing.

1595
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:38,440
I agree with you 100% I
think that healthcare should
be mandatory that society

1596
01:29:39,081 --> 01:29:42,860
takes care of its citizens. Yeah, I think
there should be optional healthcare,

1597
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:44,510
like a really good doctor,
you know,

1598
01:29:44,511 --> 01:29:46,130
like to get your knee fixed
or something like that.

1599
01:29:46,131 --> 01:29:47,510
You want to go to the
guy who does the Lakers,

1600
01:29:47,990 --> 01:29:50,000
but everyone should be
able to get healthcare.

1601
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:53,890
The the, the poor people in society
should have free health care.

1602
01:29:53,891 --> 01:29:55,960
And when I said the poor people,
like people, like students,

1603
01:29:55,961 --> 01:29:57,640
even if you come from a
rich family or whatever,

1604
01:29:57,641 --> 01:30:01,150
but once you're on your own at 18 and you
want to stand on your own two legs and

1605
01:30:01,151 --> 01:30:03,550
you don't want to ring mom and
dad up and go, moo, moo new book,

1606
01:30:03,580 --> 01:30:05,770
you know what I mean?
They should be taken care of.

1607
01:30:05,771 --> 01:30:08,260
And then once you get a bit like,
normally when you get money,

1608
01:30:08,261 --> 01:30:11,230
it's lighter in life and you have
more islands later in life anyway.

1609
01:30:11,470 --> 01:30:15,830
But in the UK, I paid for my
private health care on top
of my normal health care.

1610
01:30:15,970 --> 01:30:18,760
Now if the public health healthcare,
if I had something small,

1611
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:23,710
I used to use the public health k just
to see a GP or the emergency room or

1612
01:30:23,711 --> 01:30:26,700
whatever. I just sold my thing. And
then if they said like I had to,

1613
01:30:26,710 --> 01:30:30,490
like for instance, I had a cyst in my neck
that had to be cut out and the doctor,

1614
01:30:30,491 --> 01:30:31,870
when the doctor goes,
all right,

1615
01:30:31,871 --> 01:30:33,940
you can be put on the waiting
list for the public health care.

1616
01:30:33,941 --> 01:30:37,780
You can get it done in four weeks or I
can do it for you tomorrow if you use

1617
01:30:37,781 --> 01:30:41,380
your private cover. So you get
moved up the ladder quicker. Right.

1618
01:30:41,590 --> 01:30:43,300
So at least people who were
complaining and American look,

1619
01:30:43,330 --> 01:30:47,200
Oh and get as much help if you still
buy and on top, that's a better system.

1620
01:30:47,620 --> 01:30:50,110
And then nothing changes. But it's, it's,

1621
01:30:50,140 --> 01:30:54,910
I don't think they've structured it
brilliant. Yeah. He or maybe they've had,

1622
01:30:54,940 --> 01:30:58,420
they've been up against it trying to
explain it to Americans because I listened

1623
01:30:58,421 --> 01:31:02,500
to people on the radio all the time who
had just like, who sound poor to me.

1624
01:31:02,860 --> 01:31:05,860
They sound like they're working class
people who kind of, and they are like,

1625
01:31:05,861 --> 01:31:09,110
I don't want these healthcare, these self
care is going to, and you're like, what?

1626
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:12,150
You don't want what you
don't want to have. Like

1627
01:31:13,770 --> 01:31:18,340
the whole fact that these companies
won't cover existing conditions.

1628
01:31:18,580 --> 01:31:21,230
If you have a little child that's
born with aids or whatever and,

1629
01:31:21,231 --> 01:31:25,360
and it's a very like exact thing of
just say it, but of course someone,

1630
01:31:25,361 --> 01:31:26,420
they should have health care.

1631
01:31:27,030 --> 01:31:31,890
Exactly. You know there should be certain
core things that society takes care of.

1632
01:31:32,070 --> 01:31:33,930
There should be law enforcement,

1633
01:31:33,931 --> 01:31:36,010
there should be hospitals
just to be fire departments.

1634
01:31:36,390 --> 01:31:38,730
When those core things are
not being taken care of,

1635
01:31:39,090 --> 01:31:41,970
if you don't have health care for,
for people,

1636
01:31:41,971 --> 01:31:45,660
I mean the w what's the point in
having a society like what you can't,

1637
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:49,560
if you can't give these people the
ability to heal themselves. I mean,

1638
01:31:49,620 --> 01:31:51,360
isn't that like one of the
major things you would,

1639
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:54,370
let's take care of people's heads.
Not In the constitution,

1640
01:31:54,371 --> 01:31:56,680
but in the constitution.

1641
01:31:57,360 --> 01:32:00,100
It was written when health care was shit.

1642
01:32:00,990 --> 01:32:04,450
What the fuck they were doing chicken
bones and fucking didn't even have

1643
01:32:04,451 --> 01:32:06,760
bandaids. How about that?
They didn't have bandaids.

1644
01:32:06,790 --> 01:32:09,340
They didn't have sticky shit yet.
It leaches were very,

1645
01:32:09,341 --> 01:32:12,430
very in that that's how
people thought you'd heal.

1646
01:32:12,580 --> 01:32:13,930
They didn't know enough about bodies.

1647
01:32:13,931 --> 01:32:17,890
But the whole idea that we have to
stick only buy things that were in the

1648
01:32:17,891 --> 01:32:18,724
constitution.

1649
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:23,080
The world is so fucking
radically different than it
was in the 17 hundreds and

1650
01:32:23,081 --> 01:32:26,050
the I, the idea is just fucking
stupid. It's just a stupid idea.

1651
01:32:26,620 --> 01:32:30,370
The constitution has some great ideas
and a great understanding of what goes

1652
01:32:30,371 --> 01:32:31,810
wrong when corruption

1653
01:32:32,700 --> 01:32:36,620
commandments. It's a good foundation
and a base, but then you can add to it.

1654
01:32:36,621 --> 01:32:41,390
And then, you know, what did Louis
Ck say that uh, there's no, the, the,

1655
01:32:41,670 --> 01:32:43,590
the 10 commandments don't say you can't

1656
01:32:43,710 --> 01:32:47,760
rife. Well, rapists kind of
tolerate it in the Bible.

1657
01:32:48,410 --> 01:32:50,250
And when her second class
citizens in the Bible,

1658
01:32:50,270 --> 01:32:55,060
I mean it's so clearly flavored
by the time in which people, uh,

1659
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:58,590
wrote it. I mean there's a lot of
fucking shit and the Bible though,

1660
01:32:58,860 --> 01:32:59,460
when you were there,

1661
01:32:59,460 --> 01:33:03,840
talk about coveting that wives neighbor
that's not about fucking are wanting to

1662
01:33:03,850 --> 01:33:07,170
fucker. It's about she's
property. That's what it is.

1663
01:33:07,770 --> 01:33:12,300
It's like taking his property.
It's not like coveting his wife,

1664
01:33:12,330 --> 01:33:15,570
you know it will because they're in love.
When you got the GIG

1665
01:33:15,620 --> 01:33:16,800
vice and over a tit,

1666
01:33:17,820 --> 01:33:19,730
you're going to like calm it.
I'll put it on yet.

1667
01:33:20,630 --> 01:33:24,870
Great grasp of the English language. Well
I don't think most people do. All right.

1668
01:33:25,290 --> 01:33:29,240
My neighbor's wife though was about
him being, you know, him owning her.

1669
01:33:29,660 --> 01:33:31,370
Yay Slaves.
It's they,

1670
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:35,870
they have all these laws about in the
Bible about beating your slaves. It's all

1671
01:33:35,950 --> 01:33:40,910
written about wherever the guy was.
And we did a five mile radius. Is it?

1672
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:44,380
There's a webpage could ask God or
something with little kids can type in and

1673
01:33:44,381 --> 01:33:49,381
the most asked question and ask God is
this is what kids brains work like kids

1674
01:33:49,541 --> 01:33:51,430
want to know where they
kangaroos on the Ark.

1675
01:33:52,700 --> 01:33:53,533
All right,

1676
01:33:54,260 --> 01:33:58,330
hear all the stories a child can get the
Bible down to this is the information I

1677
01:33:58,331 --> 01:34:01,480
want. Where are the Kangaroos in
the arc is the most asked question.

1678
01:34:01,481 --> 01:34:06,040
And the answer is uh, although there was
no mention of Kangaroos in the Bible,

1679
01:34:06,100 --> 01:34:08,410
you can be assured because there was
two of each animal that there were

1680
01:34:08,411 --> 01:34:09,244
kangaroos on the air.

1681
01:34:09,510 --> 01:34:12,300
They just decided to leave it out
because not a lot of Australians read the

1682
01:34:12,301 --> 01:34:12,840
Bible.

1683
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:16,230
No, they just left it out because they
didn't fucking know about Australia.

1684
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:22,050
God made God made the entire earth and
the universe and all that type of stuff.

1685
01:34:22,051 --> 01:34:26,310
And he did it in like a week,
but a didn't know about it.

1686
01:34:26,390 --> 01:34:28,520
Australia,
at least not to mention in his book,

1687
01:34:28,700 --> 01:34:32,450
the Australia thing is very interesting
because it's such a huge continent and

1688
01:34:32,451 --> 01:34:36,190
there's all these animals that are
specific to Australia, like the kangaroo.

1689
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:38,090
Those motherfuckers aren't anywhere else.

1690
01:34:38,490 --> 01:34:41,840
No,
I'm fucking wombats

1691
01:34:42,370 --> 01:34:44,560
on the Yak.
And when Noah finished,

1692
01:34:44,830 --> 01:34:48,130
when the water was going down
or when the water was receding,

1693
01:34:48,160 --> 01:34:49,480
like to where it is now,

1694
01:34:50,460 --> 01:34:53,400
legal and drop everyone off
at their different places did,

1695
01:34:53,780 --> 01:34:57,710
it might be all these animals were rocking
around, whatever the that he was in,

1696
01:34:57,711 --> 01:34:57,980
they all

1697
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:01,370
lived in this one town and then you went,
oh, this is all the animals we got left.

1698
01:35:01,460 --> 01:35:05,320
I'm going to touch your garden.
Australia. Y'All gone astray. Paula Bays,

1699
01:35:05,321 --> 01:35:09,440
you all going to be on this bike
for a wall. Uh, lions. Africa,

1700
01:35:10,180 --> 01:35:11,600
like he must have decided,
right?

1701
01:35:11,601 --> 01:35:13,640
Is there a bit in the Bible
where he decides no one,

1702
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:17,740
they all walked and they found
their spots on the world.

1703
01:35:17,820 --> 01:35:20,220
Yeah. How, how did they
make it to Australia?

1704
01:35:20,870 --> 01:35:23,540
God provided them walking
on water abilities.

1705
01:35:23,650 --> 01:35:26,410
They gave him these big shoes that you
have on holidays that you think you're

1706
01:35:26,411 --> 01:35:31,040
good when you're going to walk on the
walk on water. Tennis racket shoes. Yeah.

1707
01:35:31,190 --> 01:35:33,000
Those ones,
those are snow shoes.

1708
01:35:33,030 --> 01:35:35,450
They, you need those man. If
you actually go walk in snow,

1709
01:35:35,451 --> 01:35:40,010
if you were watching those a Alaska shows
where people live and you from sinking

1710
01:35:40,011 --> 01:35:40,520
or yeah,

1711
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:45,520
they have these giant like you know sort
of like net looking shoes and they walk

1712
01:35:45,651 --> 01:35:47,450
around on those fucking
things and it keeps you from,

1713
01:35:47,690 --> 01:35:49,640
it spreads out your weight
over a large period.

1714
01:35:49,670 --> 01:35:54,200
A large a space keeps you from like if
you were on pegs walking through the snow

1715
01:35:54,201 --> 01:35:57,350
would be a real fucking pain in the ass.
Stilts would be not good.

1716
01:35:57,440 --> 01:36:00,350
Like you don't want a wide tire
when you drive it in the snow.

1717
01:36:00,380 --> 01:36:03,930
A lot of people think that you don't get
more traction if you had a wide tire.

1718
01:36:04,310 --> 01:36:04,551
Yeah,

1719
01:36:04,551 --> 01:36:07,880
you actually want a more narrow tire
because the narrow tire cuts through the

1720
01:36:07,881 --> 01:36:12,710
snow. The big wide tires tend to float
on it because there's more weight is

1721
01:36:12,711 --> 01:36:15,830
distributed over a larger patch,
a larger pattern.

1722
01:36:16,070 --> 01:36:19,530
I don't really understand the snow.
I find it.

1723
01:36:20,030 --> 01:36:24,200
I find it weird whenever I go play a Gig,
like I was just in this week,

1724
01:36:24,201 --> 01:36:25,430
I was in Milwaukee and Detroit.

1725
01:36:25,431 --> 01:36:30,431
It was snowing in both places and I'm
there in the snow and I feel like telling

1726
01:36:32,001 --> 01:36:36,380
the people, you know, you're
allowed to live anywhere in America.

1727
01:36:36,500 --> 01:36:40,160
You're a citizen. You can live in
anyway. You live in Hawaii anyway.

1728
01:36:40,220 --> 01:36:42,920
You want people shovel in the net,
they fucking driveway.

1729
01:36:42,921 --> 01:36:44,060
It seems like madness to me,

1730
01:36:44,580 --> 01:36:48,360
kind of madness, but there's a certain
type of person that grows up around snow.

1731
01:36:48,450 --> 01:36:50,010
That's a hard year person.

1732
01:36:50,220 --> 01:36:53,370
I understand like Canadians
where they're like, ah,

1733
01:36:53,371 --> 01:36:56,970
I like to hunt and this and I
like to cut down trees and shit.

1734
01:36:57,870 --> 01:37:00,360
You know what I mean? I'm Sarah.
Yeah, yeah. I liked the top.

1735
01:37:00,420 --> 01:37:03,990
I'm going to put a tap in that tree over
there, get syrup out of it. I'm like,

1736
01:37:03,991 --> 01:37:08,960
all right, enjoy yourself, but I
don't understand like if you just,

1737
01:37:08,970 --> 01:37:10,110
if you live in the city,

1738
01:37:10,260 --> 01:37:13,080
let's say if you have an apartment
in the middle of one of these cities,

1739
01:37:13,890 --> 01:37:17,400
if you want to live in a big house
in the hills and be like, Eh,

1740
01:37:17,940 --> 01:37:20,900
I've brought you some elk. Right.
That's what I'm talking about. Yeah,

1741
01:37:21,450 --> 01:37:25,110
I understand that. But why?
Why do I live in New York City?

1742
01:37:26,110 --> 01:37:28,830
And I also don't understand why.
Let's say you have a shitty job.

1743
01:37:28,831 --> 01:37:32,010
Like you're the guy in a
booth that cuts keys, right?

1744
01:37:32,011 --> 01:37:33,630
And you'd fix heels and shoes.

1745
01:37:33,631 --> 01:37:38,150
I've never understood why those two
occupations are bound together. Together.

1746
01:37:38,790 --> 01:37:42,780
Yeah. It's always the shoe hit
fixing guy. Also, we'll cut keys.

1747
01:37:43,370 --> 01:37:46,280
I don't know if that's true. That
is, you know what I'm saying, man,

1748
01:37:47,190 --> 01:37:51,650
the mailbox, I, I, there's a like a ups
place that I sent him packages out of.

1749
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:52,920
They also make keys.

1750
01:37:53,130 --> 01:37:56,010
Yeah. Keys, keys of attached to other

1751
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:59,750
occupations. He catches them. A keystone
war. You got to have a case store,

1752
01:37:59,751 --> 01:38:02,760
you've got to go.
I make keys and donuts.

1753
01:38:03,210 --> 01:38:08,210
I never knew that the shoe dog shoe guy
is inherently mixed in with the key guy.

1754
01:38:08,850 --> 01:38:12,990
I understand the key guy when he's,
when he's hanging out with the guy,

1755
01:38:13,170 --> 01:38:15,830
put batteries in watches. Look
it. That's it. That's enough.

1756
01:38:15,950 --> 01:38:19,260
This is the sign for sale on Ebay.
It's fork.

1757
01:38:19,261 --> 01:38:23,220
He keeps getting that and
ship it to Jim Jefferies

1758
01:38:24,830 --> 01:38:27,660
cake cutting. That's the thing.
Pop. Please purchase that.

1759
01:38:27,661 --> 01:38:31,590
It's 29 99 first that I would
ship to. Oh, I'll have that.

1760
01:38:31,591 --> 01:38:36,180
I'll put that in my gymnasium. Um,
so, so they have those it. Okay.

1761
01:38:36,181 --> 01:38:36,900
Now if you do that

1762
01:38:36,900 --> 01:38:39,450
job and you're doing,
you fix fixer heal for five,

1763
01:38:39,451 --> 01:38:44,451
$10 and you do a key for $3 and you
sit in your booth Keon and chewing.

1764
01:38:45,700 --> 01:38:47,240
Well,
I do that in Manhattan.

1765
01:38:47,630 --> 01:38:52,070
Why don't you become the guy does
that in like Kansas, Manhattan?

1766
01:38:52,510 --> 01:38:54,050
No,
but you can live anywhere.

1767
01:38:54,051 --> 01:38:57,140
You're not making a lot of money
with that key business. Enough.

1768
01:38:58,120 --> 01:39:03,120
Pile up your cash, the rent in
every place. Get a new house there.

1769
01:39:03,510 --> 01:39:05,510
Yeah,
but it's a big investment to move.

1770
01:39:05,630 --> 01:39:09,680
See the big problem with moving is you
need three months where the rent they

1771
01:39:09,681 --> 01:39:12,790
need first, last and security.
That's a lot of fucking money. Sure.

1772
01:39:12,890 --> 01:39:16,640
You also need the moving truck.
You also need the time.

1773
01:39:17,860 --> 01:39:22,070
I could just give away all my shit.
I moved to England Guy Wellman, Shit.

1774
01:39:22,490 --> 01:39:24,950
I moved over here to America.
Gave away fucking everything.

1775
01:39:25,050 --> 01:39:27,660
Yeah, but you're a successful
comic. There's a difference.

1776
01:39:27,661 --> 01:39:29,430
You make a good living every week.

1777
01:39:29,640 --> 01:39:32,640
That stuff that you need to do your
job as minimizing. What do you need?

1778
01:39:32,641 --> 01:39:35,640
You need a notebook. When I
moved to Britain, I was flattered

1779
01:39:35,670 --> 01:39:38,400
broke and then when I moved over
here I actually was getting,

1780
01:39:38,430 --> 01:39:41,580
I was getting sued by paramount when
I moved over here and they basically

1781
01:39:41,581 --> 01:39:42,780
cleaned up my bank account as well.

1782
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:43,793
Why were you getting sued?

1783
01:39:44,100 --> 01:39:48,500
I had a told them about stole Davy d

1784
01:39:48,510 --> 01:39:51,600
deal with paramount DVDs. You, UK.

1785
01:39:52,440 --> 01:39:54,060
I can speak about this now
because it's been so long.

1786
01:39:54,120 --> 01:39:57,090
I think I've the statue of whatever
it might be done. I don't give a fuck.

1787
01:39:58,290 --> 01:40:00,110
So I had,
I had this

1788
01:40:00,520 --> 01:40:02,740
DVD deal,
uh,

1789
01:40:02,830 --> 01:40:06,580
and I might one that was never meant to
have gone into the shops that I said I

1790
01:40:06,581 --> 01:40:08,500
can, I'm just going to make
one to sell after gigs.

1791
01:40:08,830 --> 01:40:11,680
So it was done really on the
cheap and it's called contraband,

1792
01:40:11,681 --> 01:40:14,510
which is sort of a cool name
for it because it wasn't
in shops and all that type

1793
01:40:14,511 --> 01:40:15,344
of stuff.
Right.

1794
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:20,800
And what happened was I,
after I made that,

1795
01:40:20,830 --> 01:40:24,520
I just started to get popular in the UK
and they released this into the shops.

1796
01:40:24,521 --> 01:40:27,280
I already wasn't happy with them
cause it was a really shitty product,

1797
01:40:27,880 --> 01:40:31,900
really bicycling crap product.
Anyway, I come over here,

1798
01:40:31,901 --> 01:40:34,390
so I got that DVD in the shops over there.
I'm doing very well in Britain,

1799
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:36,010
the well the end of a festival and stuff.

1800
01:40:36,011 --> 01:40:38,350
And I had a profile now I came over here,

1801
01:40:38,351 --> 01:40:43,330
I got my HBO special and I went back on,
couldn't use everyone.

1802
01:40:43,330 --> 01:40:46,240
I got an HBO special, I'm going
to make it in America now as well.

1803
01:40:46,540 --> 01:40:50,260
And The lady that was the executive,
it was like talking to a fucking child.

1804
01:40:50,261 --> 01:40:54,430
It was, she was like, but you've
still got a three deal with us.

1805
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:57,550
And I'm there going, yeah,
but let me do this one.

1806
01:40:57,850 --> 01:41:00,070
Then we'll then we'll start
selling product in America.

1807
01:41:00,071 --> 01:41:03,640
I'll do the next three with you. You've
already got me for a cheap, right.

1808
01:41:04,030 --> 01:41:06,190
Let me do this one in America.
The raise my price. And she goes,

1809
01:41:06,490 --> 01:41:10,810
but you can't do that.
You your deals with us as our weight.

1810
01:41:11,290 --> 01:41:14,850
I'm doing the HBO special.
Sumi and so they, they,

1811
01:41:14,900 --> 01:41:19,750
they sued me for the advanced money
they gave me for the four. And then, um,

1812
01:41:19,850 --> 01:41:20,320
I see

1813
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:22,890
Vance give you, well you don't have
to tell you, but 90,000 pounds.

1814
01:41:23,640 --> 01:41:25,290
And so you had to give him back.

1815
01:41:25,340 --> 01:41:29,390
Yeah. Which is like, which is like
150,000 American who was, you know,

1816
01:41:29,391 --> 01:41:30,570
a lot of money,
you know.

1817
01:41:31,190 --> 01:41:36,190
And I had to give him back that plus
plus money that I want to be less than

1818
01:41:36,681 --> 01:41:39,500
that. Anyway, I had to give them that
plus money that they'd spent on me.

1819
01:41:39,501 --> 01:41:43,340
So it was like another 20,000
pounds, whatever. And so I
said, all right for that,

1820
01:41:43,370 --> 01:41:43,701
I said,

1821
01:41:43,701 --> 01:41:46,340
you have to take contraband off the
shelves because I never liked that one.

1822
01:41:46,341 --> 01:41:51,341
So I got that DVD pulled from the shops
and I did a lot of jokes off that one.

1823
01:41:51,661 --> 01:41:55,520
We were in my HBO special as well,
but um, I got out of that deal.

1824
01:41:55,521 --> 01:41:58,850
Best thing I ever did because I've now
had three more deals since then to do

1825
01:41:58,851 --> 01:42:02,510
DVDs afterwards. It was the best thing
ever getting sued by those people.

1826
01:42:02,780 --> 01:42:07,780
But at the time I had that much money
minus 10 grand in my bank account and was

1827
01:42:07,971 --> 01:42:08,804
like,

1828
01:42:08,890 --> 01:42:12,620
and I felt like I was the richest guy
in the world are like a hundred thousand

1829
01:42:12,620 --> 01:42:16,550
pounds in my bank and I felt like I'm
sitting pretty and then I'm going to move

1830
01:42:16,551 --> 01:42:20,240
to America. And then I was fucking broke
man. They took it all the bastards.

1831
01:42:20,620 --> 01:42:23,840
Well, it sounds like they were
right. You had a deal. Oh No.

1832
01:42:24,160 --> 01:42:26,230
Unfortunately fundamentally
they were right,

1833
01:42:26,920 --> 01:42:30,940
but they could have made a lot more money
out of me if they just let me out to

1834
01:42:30,941 --> 01:42:31,900
do this one special.

1835
01:42:32,110 --> 01:42:36,370
But they wouldn't trust you to do that
because if you went and did that, you,

1836
01:42:36,390 --> 01:42:40,420
you see they're not making any money
off that HBO thing. The only way to get,

1837
01:42:40,421 --> 01:42:42,820
but I would have gotten alcoholic
cost for fully functional.

1838
01:42:42,830 --> 01:42:46,600
The one I'm about to record. Yeah,
but they would've never, how do we,

1839
01:42:46,620 --> 01:42:49,440
they know even you would stay alive.
They give you this HBO special,

1840
01:42:49,450 --> 01:42:51,340
you get hit by a meteor.
You know?

1841
01:42:52,270 --> 01:42:55,510
All I know is there was one of the
executives that were working for paramount

1842
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:57,560
who agreed with me and
one of them who didn't.

1843
01:42:58,250 --> 01:43:03,020
And those two executives
were fine. I think one of the
execs actually left. Yeah.

1844
01:43:03,060 --> 01:43:03,701
Went to a different guy.

1845
01:43:03,701 --> 01:43:06,490
I went to work with Sony or something
because he was like, I can't fucking,

1846
01:43:06,600 --> 01:43:09,480
this was the stupid cause
I want to be a way to work.

1847
01:43:09,481 --> 01:43:13,410
I was the first British spies comic in,
I

1848
01:43:13,560 --> 01:43:14,520
can't even think of another one,

1849
01:43:14,521 --> 01:43:19,521
but let's say in a very long time to get
a major break in America to get an HBO

1850
01:43:20,521 --> 01:43:22,790
special or Showtime Special In America.
They had like,

1851
01:43:22,791 --> 01:43:25,260
like I'm sure Billy Connolly's
probably done one. Yeah,

1852
01:43:25,390 --> 01:43:27,540
Eddie's odds always produced
his own type of stuff.

1853
01:43:27,541 --> 01:43:31,320
But I was the first British guy to British
base guy to have that sort of thing

1854
01:43:31,650 --> 01:43:33,990
and there was no way I wasn't
going to fucking do it. Of course.

1855
01:43:34,290 --> 01:43:38,820
So I just opted out of my contract
and got sued. I don't, you know,

1856
01:43:38,821 --> 01:43:42,300
I'm not angry about, to this day I
feel like it worked out better for me.

1857
01:43:42,600 --> 01:43:45,090
But at the time it was like
someone punched me in the guts.

1858
01:43:45,150 --> 01:43:46,530
When you give over there all that money

1859
01:43:47,190 --> 01:43:49,650
still though, you loot, you
getting rid of all your stuff,

1860
01:43:49,651 --> 01:43:52,030
you're still a successful
comics. Oh No, no, no, no. It's

1861
01:43:52,050 --> 01:43:55,520
still, I still being hired
for the HBO shows. I had money
coming in. No, it wasn't.

1862
01:43:55,521 --> 01:43:57,060
It wasn't super difficult. Yeah. So,

1863
01:43:57,210 --> 01:44:00,600
but I'm saying this a lot harder
for a guy who was making keys. Yay.

1864
01:44:00,601 --> 01:44:02,770
Kt Slash v Guy.
If you really stop it,

1865
01:44:02,850 --> 01:44:07,850
think about a guy who has like a real
low paying job and the idea of saving

1866
01:44:08,671 --> 01:44:11,730
money and the idea of
figuring out saving money.

1867
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:15,610
I was reading about this general, the,
he heard this case about this general to,

1868
01:44:15,750 --> 01:44:20,130
he got sued for sexual harassment
or for sexual misconduct.

1869
01:44:20,160 --> 01:44:22,770
Adultery apparently is
illegal in the armed forces.

1870
01:44:22,920 --> 01:44:26,190
That's how they got Patraeus betray us.
Got kicked out because of adultery,

1871
01:44:26,610 --> 01:44:29,190
which is pretty fucking unbelievable when
you think about you're allowed to kill

1872
01:44:29,191 --> 01:44:31,350
people, but you're not allowed to
fuck someone other than your wife.

1873
01:44:31,950 --> 01:44:36,290
Like they'll kick you out of the army
for that. Like okay. A little preachy,

1874
01:44:36,540 --> 01:44:39,240
but yeah,
but they talked about how much this guy,

1875
01:44:39,630 --> 01:44:43,470
how much he was making and you find
out how much like a general mix,

1876
01:44:43,500 --> 01:44:44,220
like they were talking about,

1877
01:44:44,220 --> 01:44:48,110
it was $4,000 a month or $5,000
a month for four months. They,

1878
01:44:48,111 --> 01:44:49,290
they took his money away.

1879
01:44:49,490 --> 01:44:51,780
Like he didn't get paid for four
months while this trial was going on.

1880
01:44:52,050 --> 01:44:54,810
I always find it amazing when you
find out how much the president, yeah,

1881
01:44:54,870 --> 01:44:56,940
like quarter of a million.
Yeah. Yeah. It's not,

1882
01:44:56,941 --> 01:44:58,140
well I think it's a
little more than that now.

1883
01:44:58,141 --> 01:45:01,830
I think it's like a half a mil for, for
the president. But I noticed that you,

1884
01:45:01,831 --> 01:45:05,940
I know that they earn less than the stage
hands. That kind of, Gee, Whoa, Whoa,

1885
01:45:05,941 --> 01:45:08,760
are you serious? [inaudible] kind
of. You hold the stage hands.

1886
01:45:08,761 --> 01:45:13,350
It kind of the whole union bites and you
can pass the job onto your children and

1887
01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:15,750
two thirds of the stage hands,
it kind of you hold, it's like a,

1888
01:45:15,751 --> 01:45:18,270
it's like a fact that they always
giving pop quizzes earn more than the

1889
01:45:18,271 --> 01:45:19,104
president.

1890
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:20,190
Whoa.

1891
01:45:20,190 --> 01:45:25,190
In 2001 the president earned $400,000
along with $50,000 annual expense account,

1892
01:45:26,310 --> 01:45:30,240
$100,000 non taxable travel account.
Now how much is it today?

1893
01:45:30,241 --> 01:45:34,650
In 2014 today it's still 400 grand.

1894
01:45:35,820 --> 01:45:39,140
IPAD plus monster beats a trial account.

1895
01:45:39,170 --> 01:45:43,120
You always get an upgrade on Delta,
the total salaries,

1896
01:45:43,310 --> 01:45:44,200
five 50

1897
01:45:44,250 --> 01:45:48,120
per year with a an entertainment stipend.

1898
01:45:48,121 --> 01:45:51,270
He has a to $20,000 entertainment stipend.

1899
01:45:51,500 --> 01:45:55,910
That means he gets to have z come over
and singing a song in one he likes.

1900
01:45:55,950 --> 01:45:59,610
I don't think that's what it is. I think
it means like for his entertainment,

1901
01:45:59,611 --> 01:46:04,470
like money,
he spends things on to $20,000 a year,

1902
01:46:04,471 --> 01:46:07,770
which I guess over the
course of three days, 50,

1903
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:09,550
well it's probably dinner
and stuff like that.

1904
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:12,800
That's it. Probably what,
he didn't pay for anything.

1905
01:46:12,810 --> 01:46:16,200
I thought he just had a corporate card
where he could buy anything and it was on

1906
01:46:16,201 --> 01:46:17,034
us,
you know?

1907
01:46:17,050 --> 01:46:19,790
Well he has an expense account.
There's an annual expense can,

1908
01:46:19,791 --> 01:46:23,380
but it doesn't say how much it
is. Uh, but it says that in 1969,

1909
01:46:23,530 --> 01:46:25,870
Nixon made $200,000,

1910
01:46:25,871 --> 01:46:29,470
which is over a million
today in today's dollars.

1911
01:46:29,530 --> 01:46:32,750
So no per year. That's what his, his uh,

1912
01:46:32,950 --> 01:46:36,670
his salary was next and might
have given himself a raise there.

1913
01:46:37,060 --> 01:46:41,550
Yeah, he was a crook ahead. Said he
wasn't, oh, he was definitely a crook.

1914
01:46:42,300 --> 01:46:44,090
He's a piece of shit,
but everybody was okay.

1915
01:46:44,130 --> 01:46:46,800
Piece of shit back then. He was just
one of the first guys that get caught,

1916
01:46:47,080 --> 01:46:50,010
you know, there was a, a
whole series pieces of shits.

1917
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:52,980
What is this as the interview
that Jimmy Carter did,

1918
01:46:52,981 --> 01:46:57,170
saying that he doesn't use a email to
talk or anything like that cause he thinks

1919
01:46:57,210 --> 01:47:01,080
the NSA spying on him. So you
only use this postal mail. Wow.

1920
01:47:01,620 --> 01:47:04,410
Now that he told them that they're
going to intercept is post a message.

1921
01:47:06,860 --> 01:47:10,240
Of course.
Of course.

1922
01:47:10,241 --> 01:47:13,080
This is an ex president, right? Of course.

1923
01:47:13,350 --> 01:47:15,270
He doesn't even know how to use
a computer. That's being honest.

1924
01:47:15,390 --> 01:47:19,850
He probably knows how to use a
computer. He's pretty smart guy. Yeah,

1925
01:47:20,040 --> 01:47:22,620
peanut. Yeah. At a certain point
in time, I think you kind of,

1926
01:47:22,621 --> 01:47:26,250
everybody who's paying attention knows
how to use a computer in this day and age.

1927
01:47:26,920 --> 01:47:31,670
I'm the worst at it, but I can still a
mile and then you're better than dom.

1928
01:47:32,590 --> 01:47:36,780
Even Herrera should get together to
decide who is the worst because I say dumb

1929
01:47:36,870 --> 01:47:39,030
fucking beats you hands down.
Oh I can.

1930
01:47:39,420 --> 01:47:44,420
I can use Netflix and a mile and I can
look at things and update my web pages

1931
01:47:45,151 --> 01:47:48,750
and stuff. That's all I can do. But I was
the worst for years and years and years.

1932
01:47:48,780 --> 01:47:52,560
And then I always used to look at
like kids with computers and things.

1933
01:47:52,561 --> 01:47:55,960
Look at these fucking pretentious co
parents giving that kid an iPad when I

1934
01:47:55,961 --> 01:47:57,420
didn't have an Ipad,
you know what I mean?

1935
01:47:57,930 --> 01:48:02,160
And now I just gave my son
who's 16 months I go, I got it,

1936
01:48:02,161 --> 01:48:06,030
I got a new iPad and I gave him my
old one. They love him, I love him.

1937
01:48:06,060 --> 01:48:10,200
But also it's like you have to,
the world is now computers,

1938
01:48:10,201 --> 01:48:14,040
so the sooner he gets his hand on a
computer and his fiddling with a computer,

1939
01:48:14,041 --> 01:48:16,710
the better. Well, it's also,
there's connections that are made.

1940
01:48:16,711 --> 01:48:20,970
There's a bunch of games that kids can
play on iPads that are actually good for

1941
01:48:20,971 --> 01:48:24,390
your brain. They're making connections.
They figured out how to do puzzles.

1942
01:48:24,600 --> 01:48:27,780
They figured out how to
count things. There's like a
series of educational games.

1943
01:48:27,781 --> 01:48:31,050
The kids fucking love.
My three year old's steals my phone.

1944
01:48:31,051 --> 01:48:33,360
Every time I leave it down,
she'll open it and start going.

1945
01:48:33,420 --> 01:48:35,520
She knows how to open my phone.
She's fucking three.

1946
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:39,210
She swipes it and enters in the code.
She knows what my code is,

1947
01:48:39,370 --> 01:48:40,350
goes right to the APP.

1948
01:48:40,351 --> 01:48:43,770
She wants and starts playing these games
and a lot of them are fucking really,

1949
01:48:43,980 --> 01:48:46,230
they're really good for your little brain.
Well,

1950
01:48:46,231 --> 01:48:49,320
my son's favorite game is a
cat that repeats what he says.

1951
01:48:52,020 --> 01:48:52,141
Well,

1952
01:48:52,141 --> 01:48:56,730
there's fun ones to my three year old
likes to do one where she gives a Manny

1953
01:48:56,731 --> 01:48:57,900
Petty's to dogs.

1954
01:48:58,660 --> 01:49:02,620
Yeah. There's a lot of
dressing. Things are like,

1955
01:49:02,621 --> 01:49:04,380
like this one the like,

1956
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:09,400
like my son just looks at
and goes [inaudible] the
thing goes back at him and he

1957
01:49:10,061 --> 01:49:13,300
thinks that he laughs.
This is, it's, it's weird.

1958
01:49:13,301 --> 01:49:18,070
As a comedian and someone who is being
terrible at sports her entire life,

1959
01:49:18,820 --> 01:49:21,670
I see a lot of people with
dad's when they're like,
look, you just threw the bowl.

1960
01:49:21,671 --> 01:49:26,250
You just threw the bowl. I
literally with my son Go. He knows.

1961
01:49:26,350 --> 01:49:29,740
That's funny, right? Like I was,

1962
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:33,760
I was proud in the same way that a
sporty dad who sees his son kick a goal.

1963
01:49:33,790 --> 01:49:36,670
I was proud. I saw my son,
he lifted up one ass cheek,

1964
01:49:37,060 --> 01:49:38,770
he farted and then he laughed

1965
01:49:40,710 --> 01:49:45,020
and I was like, he's developing. He knows
what's good and he knows the good bits.

1966
01:49:45,080 --> 01:49:48,190
My three year old runs
over her butt cheeks

1967
01:49:48,190 --> 01:49:51,490
and farts in my face right in my face.

1968
01:49:51,640 --> 01:49:55,720
Raw naked ass right out of the tub,
runs over.

1969
01:49:55,840 --> 01:50:00,840
Ben's over front of me and far it's in
my face and then fucking cries laughing.

1970
01:50:01,540 --> 01:50:05,340
She thinks it's the funniest thing.
Is Paul Funny? She Get mad? No,

1971
01:50:05,350 --> 01:50:08,610
I think it's hilarious. How did you
get mad? I did something. Shoot,

1972
01:50:08,650 --> 01:50:11,620
I didn't talk with my son that
I think may be illegal. Right.

1973
01:50:11,621 --> 01:50:14,050
You know when you do something you're
like, oh I might have committed a crime.

1974
01:50:14,230 --> 01:50:15,200
What'd you do? Well, I,

1975
01:50:15,201 --> 01:50:18,340
I'm in the shower as I do every morning
and he always comes up when he hears me

1976
01:50:18,341 --> 01:50:21,430
in the shower cause he wakes up about an
hour and a half before I do because he

1977
01:50:21,850 --> 01:50:22,571
wakes up early and he's,

1978
01:50:22,571 --> 01:50:25,720
mom takes care of him in the morning
and I'm having to shout and he comes up

1979
01:50:25,721 --> 01:50:28,630
when he hears that I'm awake and he
starts bashing on the glass door.

1980
01:50:28,930 --> 01:50:32,440
And what I do is because I'm
a, you know, adorable guy,

1981
01:50:32,470 --> 01:50:36,610
I always like paint a little like in
the condensation I drove a little tie on

1982
01:50:36,611 --> 01:50:39,190
him or give him a voice
bubble and then say,

1983
01:50:39,191 --> 01:50:40,650
Oh I love dad or something like that.

1984
01:50:40,651 --> 01:50:43,360
I do this a little game and
he laughs and uh, anyway,

1985
01:50:43,361 --> 01:50:48,070
so I stepped back and I got good morning
Hank and he slapped my cock and he ran

1986
01:50:48,071 --> 01:50:48,904
off.

1987
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:54,910
Why is that illegal child
touching your cock right now?

1988
01:50:54,911 --> 01:50:57,760
I know like I didn't
ask him to touch my car,

1989
01:50:58,150 --> 01:51:00,850
but also is it illegal because I laughed

1990
01:51:02,780 --> 01:51:07,720
and then told you like point
of my Dick and laugh. Yeah.

1991
01:51:07,750 --> 01:51:09,590
Three year olds like penis.

1992
01:51:11,620 --> 01:51:16,570
She thinks it's hilarious though.
Penises, IRA, humorous. Sure.

1993
01:51:16,660 --> 01:51:19,480
Vaginas are humorous too.
Both of them. My, my,

1994
01:51:19,570 --> 01:51:23,680
my son now is at the stage
where loves holding east cock.

1995
01:51:24,190 --> 01:51:28,560
Just haul pinches it at the end cause
it's only [inaudible]. I don't know.

1996
01:51:28,660 --> 01:51:32,020
I haven't got, I haven't got a lot
of baby Cox to reference it against.

1997
01:51:32,021 --> 01:51:35,710
I think my son has a small car,
but it's,

1998
01:51:35,950 --> 01:51:39,410
I think it grows or right. I think
he has a nice direction, but I don't,

1999
01:51:39,620 --> 01:51:42,190
I think he has a very,
doesn't erections at 16 months.

2000
01:51:42,270 --> 01:51:46,840
I have erections from day one. Wow. Like
sometimes you wake him up in the morning,

2001
01:51:46,860 --> 01:51:48,700
would take his nappy off
because he's got a shit.

2002
01:51:48,700 --> 01:51:52,780
In the end it will be a shit covered
direction. Oh, that's a weird connection.

2003
01:51:53,380 --> 01:51:54,610
And a good name for a band.

2004
01:51:56,610 --> 01:52:01,270
It's probably already taken because
probably a website, but it's, uh, it's,

2005
01:52:01,660 --> 01:52:02,351
it is.
Yeah.

2006
01:52:02,351 --> 01:52:07,351
He gets like a little tiny woody and I
always think what is going on in his head

2007
01:52:07,811 --> 01:52:10,090
where he is wanted or needed an erection.

2008
01:52:10,091 --> 01:52:12,030
What was the dream that he had last night?
Oh,

2009
01:52:12,060 --> 01:52:14,590
I know the dreams that I'm having
when I wake up with an erection.

2010
01:52:14,860 --> 01:52:17,260
What are the ones that are
hit like is that, you know,

2011
01:52:17,261 --> 01:52:20,440
that cat saying suggestive
things off the IPAD? What is,

2012
01:52:20,810 --> 01:52:22,600
it's probably just blood in his deck.

2013
01:52:23,020 --> 01:52:27,490
It's probably just blood his dick or
it's longing for something that he,

2014
01:52:27,491 --> 01:52:28,560
you know,
I don't know.

2015
01:52:28,680 --> 01:52:31,210
You ever get boners when you
drive in for no apparent reason.

2016
01:52:31,211 --> 01:52:36,010
You're not even horny. I have, yes I
have. Those are weird. Those are boners.

2017
01:52:37,390 --> 01:52:40,270
Sometimes you got to have sex and you
got to fucking work at a bit to get it

2018
01:52:40,271 --> 01:52:40,631
going.

2019
01:52:40,631 --> 01:52:44,380
And then like other times you ever done
that one where you masturbate in the car

2020
01:52:44,710 --> 01:52:47,390
while you're driving, you get it right
because you've been stuck in traffic.

2021
01:52:47,420 --> 01:52:49,610
And then I W I was alright
with it in Britain,

2022
01:52:49,611 --> 01:52:53,240
but too many people in this
town drive SUV. Oh, I drive,

2023
01:52:53,241 --> 01:52:56,720
I drive a common challenge
or I'm lower down. Oh,

2024
01:52:56,721 --> 01:53:01,721
I get seen by a lot of people got to get
the windows or I could just stop waking

2025
01:53:02,151 --> 01:53:04,110
in my car or just get one of those things

2026
01:53:04,260 --> 01:53:07,230
women use when they breastfeed in public
and just jerk off onto that. Yeah,

2027
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:08,280
get a quilt.
Yeah,

2028
01:53:09,590 --> 01:53:13,760
I found out the best thing to do is to
plug my phone into the iPod connection

2029
01:53:13,820 --> 01:53:14,900
and then play porn in it.

2030
01:53:15,140 --> 01:53:18,560
Cause then I'll get with subwoofer and
everything surround sound port in my car.

2031
01:53:19,540 --> 01:53:20,373
That's a good move.

2032
01:53:20,480 --> 01:53:24,630
So do you like hold it with one hand and
steer with like the last time? I know,

2033
01:53:24,770 --> 01:53:25,241
I know me,

2034
01:53:25,241 --> 01:53:29,420
you have to be in traffic so I'm not
doing that much steer and beating off in

2035
01:53:29,421 --> 01:53:32,630
your car.
Since I've lived in La last five years,

2036
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:36,350
I know of three times this has happened.
It's not like I'm not going to do it.

2037
01:53:36,351 --> 01:53:41,030
Like right now, this is a hobby. This
is like I've, I've just been somewhere,

2038
01:53:41,031 --> 01:53:42,650
there's some girls got me going.

2039
01:53:42,660 --> 01:53:47,660
I mean a bit of a frenzy or I've
just had a fight with my girlfriend.

2040
01:53:47,901 --> 01:53:50,750
I'm in a bit of a bad mood. I
need to cheer myself up. Really,

2041
01:53:52,490 --> 01:53:56,360
I only beat off once in my car ever,
and it was when I was driving limos.

2042
01:53:56,780 --> 01:54:00,710
I was driving home from a Gig. Uh, I had
to drop some lady off in New Hampshire,

2043
01:54:00,711 --> 01:54:02,980
drive way the fuck up in New Hampshire.
It's a long ride back,

2044
01:54:02,990 --> 01:54:03,920
like an hour and a half back.

2045
01:54:03,921 --> 01:54:08,030
I got boards I'd beat off and I
remember the fucking massive feeling of

2046
01:54:08,031 --> 01:54:12,110
disappointment in myself that I jerked
off because I'm jerking off underneath my

2047
01:54:12,111 --> 01:54:14,450
shirt. As soon as I came,
I was like, God damn it.

2048
01:54:14,451 --> 01:54:17,810
This is going to be a thing I do all
the time now. And I never did it again.

2049
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:22,670
I was shocked, but it never came
up. I never wanted to do it again,

2050
01:54:22,850 --> 01:54:26,450
but I'm shocked because I figured I'm
such a fucking idiot once I do something

2051
01:54:26,451 --> 01:54:29,030
embarrassing like that, I'm like,
well, this is something I do now.

2052
01:54:29,060 --> 01:54:30,660
This is not going to be,
I'm not going to like

2053
01:54:31,560 --> 01:54:35,450
I remember I remember once having sex
with a go and she was just yelling at,

2054
01:54:35,451 --> 01:54:40,010
fuck me Daddy. Fuck me. Right.
And I kind of went, hey,

2055
01:54:40,011 --> 01:54:42,000
what are you calling
me that like this fort?

2056
01:54:42,020 --> 01:54:44,750
And then I slightly enjoy
it as saying it and I don't,

2057
01:54:45,290 --> 01:54:47,510
I don't need that to be a thing.
Yeah,

2058
01:54:49,340 --> 01:54:52,430
don't make that a thing for
me because then I'm fucked up,

2059
01:54:52,431 --> 01:54:55,220
but I've got to ask other people to
do it and then we're in a real fucking

2060
01:54:55,221 --> 01:54:56,054
predicament.

2061
01:54:56,510 --> 01:55:00,770
When I was in Boston, I was, I used to
bang this really crazy Portuguese chick.

2062
01:55:01,100 --> 01:55:04,070
She used to call her pussy cunt.
It was the first girl I'd ever,

2063
01:55:04,071 --> 01:55:06,830
ever heard say that. She's like,
fuck that cunt. Fuck that bitch.

2064
01:55:06,860 --> 01:55:10,520
She was like angry about it and I was
like, I hope I don't start liking this.

2065
01:55:10,760 --> 01:55:14,750
That's going to be hard to get someone
else to agree to write a lot of gals.

2066
01:55:15,590 --> 01:55:15,801
Yeah.

2067
01:55:15,801 --> 01:55:20,550
It's hard when you've got a thing and
you've got to ask you go to do that thing.

2068
01:55:20,610 --> 01:55:24,640
I, I, for a while there, I loved choking
girls while I was fucking him for awhile.

2069
01:55:24,750 --> 01:55:28,910
I'm not as Chunky as I used to be,
but I used to be. I used to be.

2070
01:55:28,911 --> 01:55:32,920
I used to be very fucking hand around
the nic pin you down while I was fucking

2071
01:55:32,921 --> 01:55:36,770
you. Right. And some girls
and I was dying. He had got
off on doing that. Right.

2072
01:55:37,010 --> 01:55:40,020
And that was, that's what got me
into it was this is how I made this.

2073
01:55:40,021 --> 01:55:42,080
And then you meet the goals.
We don't want you to do that.

2074
01:55:42,081 --> 01:55:46,120
But then I met one girl who I was
choking her and then, uh, you know,

2075
01:55:46,121 --> 01:55:48,180
I'm not checking the whole time.
Right.

2076
01:55:48,630 --> 01:55:50,940
And then I've stopped and she's
thought of as thought, oh,

2077
01:55:50,941 --> 01:55:54,420
this is what we're doing, is it, she
starts choking me and I'm like 30 that,

2078
01:55:54,421 --> 01:55:55,260
that feels horrible.

2079
01:55:58,260 --> 01:56:01,590
I don't know how bad it feels for you
women, but it really hurts my mail neck.

2080
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:04,000
The choking thing is,
it's weird.

2081
01:56:04,120 --> 01:56:07,450
It's just like one of those other things
where some people love it and some

2082
01:56:07,451 --> 01:56:10,750
people hate it and you never fucking
know until it comes up. You know,

2083
01:56:10,751 --> 01:56:13,090
you could date a girl and I have no idea.
She likes to be choked.

2084
01:56:13,250 --> 01:56:17,290
Like the first girl I ever dated
that lock to be choked was so girly.

2085
01:56:17,590 --> 01:56:21,040
She was like, so like you would
never, she was, it wasn't loud.

2086
01:56:21,190 --> 01:56:22,690
She always wore dresses.

2087
01:56:22,691 --> 01:56:26,890
She Wa she wasn't like
boisterous or you know,

2088
01:56:26,950 --> 01:56:31,420
slotting in ever slutty. Just a
regular girl and she fucking loved it.

2089
01:56:31,421 --> 01:56:34,210
She asked me to choke her and there was,
I was like, what do you mean choke you?

2090
01:56:34,211 --> 01:56:36,370
Like how, how do you
mean choke you? She goes,

2091
01:56:36,371 --> 01:56:39,800
just grabbed my neck while you're
fucking man. I'm like, okay, hard.

2092
01:56:39,801 --> 01:56:42,350
Do you want me to hurt you?
Like what's going on here? Like,

2093
01:56:42,520 --> 01:56:45,880
and then if you thought about doing it
to another girl, they would freak out.

2094
01:56:46,150 --> 01:56:50,260
Like it's weird what like one person,
what's their big turn on?

2095
01:56:50,440 --> 01:56:51,273
And another person,

2096
01:56:51,570 --> 01:56:55,040
it's a southern of know is bad when you,
when you bring the choke into a go,

2097
01:56:55,041 --> 01:56:58,370
he doesn't want it. It's
always bad. I'm like, ah.

2098
01:56:58,610 --> 01:57:01,910
I was with the girl that I had an iron
deficiency and every time she would want

2099
01:57:01,911 --> 01:57:05,270
me to choke her the next day she would
just have like these horrible bruises

2100
01:57:05,271 --> 01:57:08,510
around her neck and she just would have
to like where like turtle necks and

2101
01:57:08,511 --> 01:57:11,750
stuff. But it looked like if I ever
got in trouble, oh, I'm fucked.

2102
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:18,020
Diagnoses and anemic, which
really, yeah. Which isn't pleasant.

2103
01:57:18,140 --> 01:57:21,560
Do you eat a lot of red meat? I
do. Yeah. I'm basically saying,

2104
01:57:21,780 --> 01:57:25,470
did you ever take iron supplements?
I'm going to stop on iron supplements.

2105
01:57:25,480 --> 01:57:28,880
I've never tell him. Well, I need, I think
a dog talking. I was like three days ago,

2106
01:57:28,910 --> 01:57:31,610
I'm actually going to the doctor again,
30 minutes for the second check on this.

2107
01:57:31,720 --> 01:57:35,270
You know, you, uh, you still
smoke cigarettes. I'd probably
has a factor in too. Yep.

2108
01:57:35,420 --> 01:57:38,890
No doubt. Cigarettes. Uh, I think,
I think that's one of the scent.

2109
01:57:38,960 --> 01:57:40,340
Is that what is anemic?
Yeah,

2110
01:57:40,350 --> 01:57:45,350
just you don't have low
hemoglobin in your blood.

2111
01:57:45,980 --> 01:57:50,150
They did a blood test. It's the
hemoglobin Globin globin hemoglobin.

2112
01:57:50,240 --> 01:57:55,060
Hemoglobin oxygen. Yeah.
I'm not hugely anemic. Yeah.

2113
01:57:55,760 --> 01:57:59,600
There's a link and I'm a little bit,
uh, yeah, a little bit tinny me.

2114
01:57:59,880 --> 01:58:02,130
There's a pub med study on it.

2115
01:58:02,520 --> 01:58:06,630
The effects of cigarette smoking on
hemoglobin levels and a anemia screening.

2116
01:58:07,080 --> 01:58:08,430
Yeah. I, uh,

2117
01:58:09,030 --> 01:58:13,020
it seems to cause a generalized upward
shift of the hemoglobin distribution

2118
01:58:13,021 --> 01:58:13,411
curve,

2119
01:58:13,411 --> 01:58:18,330
which reduces the utility of the
hemoglobin level to detect anemia.

2120
01:58:19,200 --> 01:58:23,310
So it, your body doesn't detect anemia,
so it doesn't compensate as much.

2121
01:58:23,390 --> 01:58:27,110
Also, I'm a, I'm, I'm a super pale guy.

2122
01:58:27,890 --> 01:58:28,700
Uh,

2123
01:58:28,700 --> 01:58:33,130
and that's when you say super pile
people is often that they've been naming,

2124
01:58:33,230 --> 01:58:36,950
I think I'm anemic. Oh yeah, you got
it. He's always fucking cigarettes, man.

2125
01:58:37,110 --> 01:58:40,970
He's done this, that exist. I was
just born like, I'm pile for a pile.

2126
01:58:42,220 --> 01:58:43,510
We're just pie.
He's like,

2127
01:58:43,720 --> 01:58:47,500
one of the things I hate about being
pale is it's seems like one of the few

2128
01:58:47,501 --> 01:58:52,501
things in society about why of human
being looks that people in society could

2129
01:58:53,141 --> 01:58:58,141
just pass fucking judgment with and
like not act like they're being cuts.

2130
01:58:58,420 --> 01:59:00,110
Yeah. They can make fun
of you. Yeah. Right.

2131
01:59:00,290 --> 01:59:04,210
If you see someone with a big nose and you
go, fuck, you got a big nose. People go,

2132
01:59:04,240 --> 01:59:07,990
Whoa, he's up with, yeah. But you go,

2133
01:59:08,050 --> 01:59:12,130
I'll have all that people who act as
on my fucking show, who I'm employing,

2134
01:59:12,131 --> 01:59:15,580
who want to be in more fucking episodes.
Go Fuck your pile man.

2135
01:59:16,210 --> 01:59:19,810
Fuck you. That's fine. You get
offended by that. For Real. I know.

2136
01:59:19,880 --> 01:59:22,330
I just find a reason to say,
I don't know.

2137
01:59:22,331 --> 01:59:25,390
I do get offended by it in the sense
that it doesn't bother me personally,

2138
01:59:25,391 --> 01:59:29,160
that I'm pale. It bothers me when people
bring it up. I don't mind looking power.

2139
01:59:29,200 --> 01:59:30,011
I even dislike,

2140
01:59:30,011 --> 01:59:33,950
I did a photo shoot once for some head
shots and the lady fucking put bronzer or

2141
01:59:33,960 --> 01:59:37,210
I mean that whole photo shoots ruined
because I'd look to Brown and it doesn't

2142
01:59:37,211 --> 01:59:42,090
suit me. You can't let them fuck with
you with the makeup and tanning. Tanning.

2143
01:59:42,140 --> 01:59:46,390
Yeah. That's what you to do. I
take a selfie in a tanning booth.

2144
01:59:46,730 --> 01:59:49,120
Gay Bay self. We have a
book. It's not the gas.

2145
01:59:49,121 --> 01:59:51,340
You don't have a copy in your
mouth or your outside to my hand.

2146
01:59:53,120 --> 01:59:55,390
I try to,
uh,

2147
01:59:55,450 --> 01:59:59,590
I tried my whole life to sound bake and
the Tan and to get doc all through high

2148
01:59:59,591 --> 02:00:00,940
school when it did affect me,

2149
02:00:00,941 --> 02:00:04,040
when I did not like the way
I looked or it wasn't at all.

2150
02:00:04,080 --> 02:00:06,070
It wasn't an ease with the way I look.
Oh I see.

2151
02:00:06,071 --> 02:00:09,700
So there's a residual thing when someone's
making fun of you saying you're pale.

2152
02:00:10,150 --> 02:00:13,630
It used to be a thing used to come he
Casper at school and stuff like that and

2153
02:00:13,700 --> 02:00:17,050
it's not about black people
like no damn you're dark.

2154
02:00:17,080 --> 02:00:21,820
Like you know a guy really the whole
world wants to be like a coffee color.

2155
02:00:22,390 --> 02:00:23,140
Right.

2156
02:00:23,140 --> 02:00:27,040
Because all of us white people are trying
to like get darker and then the really

2157
02:00:27,041 --> 02:00:29,830
black people now it's very
common to bleach their skin.

2158
02:00:29,860 --> 02:00:33,370
That bleach it down a bit. They don't
want to be super black is a really, yeah,

2159
02:00:33,371 --> 02:00:34,031
there was a thing,

2160
02:00:34,031 --> 02:00:37,960
I was watching it on something I chose
this lady get don't bleach and a kids

2161
02:00:37,961 --> 02:00:40,180
cause she didn't want them to be super,
super black.

2162
02:00:40,181 --> 02:00:43,480
They want to all be Beyonce Brown.

2163
02:00:43,510 --> 02:00:46,700
Beyonce brown I think
is the term that's a,

2164
02:00:47,050 --> 02:00:51,100
that's a type of paint that you get done
at home depot. I was some Beyonce Brown.

2165
02:00:51,490 --> 02:00:53,400
Um,
it's like they want to be Beyonce,

2166
02:00:53,401 --> 02:00:56,570
sort of that Whitney Houston sort of
color and white people want to be dark it

2167
02:00:56,571 --> 02:00:59,920
and we all want to meet in this one.
Sort of middle range

2168
02:00:59,960 --> 02:01:01,340
Mexican. Yeah, there's a,

2169
02:01:01,341 --> 02:01:05,390
there's a nutritional supplement that
allows people to bleach their skin.

2170
02:01:05,600 --> 02:01:09,920
It's something that's been really
popular in the Philippines.

2171
02:01:10,640 --> 02:01:14,870
Um, fuck is the stuff
called. There's a, there's,

2172
02:01:15,980 --> 02:01:19,950
there's an actual like nutritional
supplements that people take and they

2173
02:01:19,951 --> 02:01:21,110
injected apparently,

2174
02:01:21,190 --> 02:01:24,260
and it's gained popular in the
Philippines for some strange reason.

2175
02:01:24,350 --> 02:01:24,471
Well,

2176
02:01:24,471 --> 02:01:28,760
you even look like the movie stars are
always sort of like a more milky black.

2177
02:01:29,060 --> 02:01:32,780
And then when you have like a girl
who was that girl out of Africa,

2178
02:01:32,781 --> 02:01:33,620
I think she's out of Africa.

2179
02:01:33,720 --> 02:01:37,480
She was British or something out of 12
years of his life. I didn't see that. Um,

2180
02:01:37,630 --> 02:01:41,390
she got nominated for the Oscar alert
dog odds. Great. Yeah. And she was,

2181
02:01:41,391 --> 02:01:42,970
she was amazing in it,
but now they would,

2182
02:01:43,010 --> 02:01:48,010
they were talking about
like how liberating or how
good it was to see an actual

2183
02:01:49,940 --> 02:01:54,140
black woman portrayed like you
know, like she, she had afro,

2184
02:01:54,141 --> 02:01:55,750
he taught the Hay like shut down.

2185
02:01:55,760 --> 02:01:59,150
She wasn't trying to look like a watch
chick or something. You know what I mean?

2186
02:01:59,900 --> 02:02:02,210
The fashion people were going nuts.
We really liked this.

2187
02:02:02,211 --> 02:02:07,211
Now I think where I lead Wa
maybe see if I was black,

2188
02:02:07,521 --> 02:02:09,300
I don't understand women
who, whose, who did the,

2189
02:02:09,360 --> 02:02:14,150
if I was playing I'd be Afro all day. I
would be like Jackson five top. I know.

2190
02:02:14,151 --> 02:02:15,990
I always,
whenever you see a chick with that Hairdo,

2191
02:02:16,050 --> 02:02:18,320
it's always like fucking looking at fucks.
See Chick.

2192
02:02:18,560 --> 02:02:21,710
It's always a big turn from a turn on
for me. I love a chick with an Afro.

2193
02:02:21,770 --> 02:02:25,400
It was big in the 70s and she's town
that foxy brown had it, right? Yeah.

2194
02:02:25,401 --> 02:02:28,520
When you see like the chickies like I'm
a member of the Black Panthers and they

2195
02:02:28,530 --> 02:02:32,030
got the big fucking Afro, you're
like, fuck it. Take me down.

2196
02:02:33,650 --> 02:02:38,560
The white man choke me. Glutathione
is it? That's, I couldn't remember it.

2197
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:40,070
[inaudible] they uh,

2198
02:02:40,100 --> 02:02:43,280
they take a injections of this
shit or they rub it on her skin.

2199
02:02:43,340 --> 02:02:46,970
I don't know what the fuck
they're doing, but uh, maybe both.

2200
02:02:47,240 --> 02:02:51,590
But gludethyon apparently makes
your skin lighten. That's it.

2201
02:02:51,591 --> 02:02:56,390
That's how you want to look at that
for there. That's on her asshole too.

2202
02:02:56,510 --> 02:03:00,970
Yeah. You should have a big hairy
thing between the legs and a hairy

2203
02:03:01,080 --> 02:03:03,190
[inaudible] is the
worst thing in the world

2204
02:03:03,300 --> 02:03:06,000
are really used to be,
didn't used to be a problem at all.

2205
02:03:06,610 --> 02:03:08,370
Yeah. But I, there was
a girl, there was a guy,

2206
02:03:08,371 --> 02:03:11,830
fuck did our island who was one of the
best looking girls I ever fucking light

2207
02:03:11,831 --> 02:03:12,401
our eyes on.

2208
02:03:12,401 --> 02:03:17,401
And she was at a Gig and I was like single
and young in my twenties and I might

2209
02:03:17,861 --> 02:03:19,720
like,
I'm going to get that girl right.

2210
02:03:19,721 --> 02:03:23,320
And I was gigging it on for three days
and I romance this girl from the moment I

2211
02:03:23,321 --> 02:03:23,531
met her.

2212
02:03:23,531 --> 02:03:25,990
I took her out to lunch the next day and
then dinner and the thing and took her

2213
02:03:25,991 --> 02:03:28,870
to another show. Invited a
friend. I worked there. Right.

2214
02:03:29,620 --> 02:03:31,420
And it's very hard to
fucking Irish chicken.

2215
02:03:31,421 --> 02:03:35,080
This chick was about 19 it's hard to
fucking Irish chick. Yeah, they've got it.

2216
02:03:35,081 --> 02:03:36,550
They've all gone to Catholic schools.

2217
02:03:36,551 --> 02:03:39,520
They all have this cloud
of sex is evil over them.

2218
02:03:40,150 --> 02:03:44,800
They didn't have playboy
until the mid 1990s right.

2219
02:03:44,800 --> 02:03:48,160
It's a pretty repressed old
sexual society, the island.

2220
02:03:49,120 --> 02:03:53,440
Anyway, so I fucking got this
girl, she's a little bit like,

2221
02:03:53,441 --> 02:03:55,300
she wasn't up for it,
but I convinced her and said,

2222
02:03:55,301 --> 02:03:58,000
I'm going to come over to London and
hang out with me. And I was like,

2223
02:03:58,001 --> 02:04:02,100
this is like my girlfriend now on
that. And then it was like, what?

2224
02:04:02,101 --> 02:04:07,101
What was his like 2004 and like a
fucking a full length wild Bush.

2225
02:04:08,530 --> 02:04:12,310
And I had grown up in this era of
not really seeing it. I was just,

2226
02:04:13,090 --> 02:04:17,140
I almost couldn't find, I did fuck it,
but I almost couldn't. It was so horrific.

2227
02:04:17,141 --> 02:04:20,050
I still have flashbacks of it right
now as I'm saying, and I can see it.

2228
02:04:20,380 --> 02:04:21,280
It was menacing.

2229
02:04:21,740 --> 02:04:24,590
Here's the total complete opposite.
When I was in high school,

2230
02:04:24,591 --> 02:04:27,080
I was dating this girl dating,
like, you know, we would date,

2231
02:04:27,110 --> 02:04:29,930
we'd go on and off and you
know, it didn't, you know,

2232
02:04:30,410 --> 02:04:33,710
in the on and off she was banging
this other guy who told her,

2233
02:04:33,770 --> 02:04:38,070
told her to shave her pussy.
So she came over my house and,

2234
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:40,620
uh, we're about to get it. And she's
like, I can't, I can't take my pants off.

2235
02:04:40,621 --> 02:04:43,890
And I go, why she, cause you're gonna
think I'm a whore. And I go, why?

2236
02:04:43,891 --> 02:04:46,530
Why am I going to think you're
a whore? Like she goes, cause

2237
02:04:48,150 --> 02:04:49,260
whatever the guy's name is,

2238
02:04:49,380 --> 02:04:52,200
he talks to me to shape my pussy
and I'm so embarrassed. I'm like,

2239
02:04:52,650 --> 02:04:57,510
I don't give a fuck. Like what do I
care, you know, east it and freaked out.

2240
02:04:57,580 --> 02:05:00,730
Well, I didn't care. No,
not at all. I was, but,

2241
02:05:00,750 --> 02:05:04,380
but she was scared that I was going
to see her with a shave pussy.

2242
02:05:04,620 --> 02:05:09,510
The complete opposite. It's the
only way to go. But this is like,

2243
02:05:09,550 --> 02:05:11,640
you know,
1980 whatever the hell it was.

2244
02:05:11,800 --> 02:05:13,190
I always thought if I got a weird,
when there's,

2245
02:05:13,191 --> 02:05:15,940
there's always women that you know
have a Harry Bush when they're having a

2246
02:05:15,941 --> 02:05:17,140
conversation with you and you're like,

2247
02:05:17,480 --> 02:05:20,560
why would men want to have
sex with like a shave pussy?

2248
02:05:20,561 --> 02:05:25,360
Like I must be like having sex
with like a child and you're like,

2249
02:05:25,361 --> 02:05:26,920
that is the weakest argument.

2250
02:05:26,921 --> 02:05:30,820
You could fucking and then what then
then you should only kiss men was beads.

2251
02:05:31,420 --> 02:05:35,080
If you kiss him, man, he shaved his face
when he kissing. A young boy is straight.

2252
02:05:35,500 --> 02:05:39,910
You fucking pedophile go out with
a fucking Muslim comp with a beard.

2253
02:05:39,911 --> 02:05:42,040
Where are your happiest,
right?

2254
02:05:43,150 --> 02:05:43,960
It's actually,

2255
02:05:43,960 --> 02:05:47,230
did you know that pet harassed is someone
who actually has sex with children on

2256
02:05:47,231 --> 02:05:51,970
a rough pedophile, better
rast, right? Pet a raft.

2257
02:05:52,420 --> 02:05:55,030
That's a good spot for
a pedophile pedophile.

2258
02:05:55,031 --> 02:05:59,500
Someone who's attracted Peder rast is
someone who has sex with them but not

2259
02:05:59,501 --> 02:06:02,030
attracted. Yeah, they just
do it because it's fun.

2260
02:06:05,980 --> 02:06:10,840
That's a very good analogy though.
The beard analogy and the Bush analogy.

2261
02:06:11,290 --> 02:06:14,290
Some people just don't want to do
anything that they don't want to do.

2262
02:06:14,291 --> 02:06:16,270
Anything that like is society standard,

2263
02:06:16,271 --> 02:06:20,170
like a woman doesn't want to have to
agree like why should I shave my pussy?

2264
02:06:20,171 --> 02:06:23,260
Why should I have to like you someone
when they're like that? Like what?

2265
02:06:23,350 --> 02:06:28,220
Because it's in porn. Is that what it is?
Cause that's what it is. It's it's, yeah,

2266
02:06:29,110 --> 02:06:31,360
and Monterey Bay.
It might be because in porn,

2267
02:06:31,361 --> 02:06:35,200
but it's also because once a man's
used one of those shaving one's,

2268
02:06:35,201 --> 02:06:38,410
it's a lot more enjoyable than
the coarseness of the, well,

2269
02:06:38,460 --> 02:06:42,490
I've remember fucking hairy pussies and
having my cock old beaten up like it's

2270
02:06:42,491 --> 02:06:44,010
been fucking rip through a Brillo right

2271
02:06:44,060 --> 02:06:46,490
pad.
The last one I had,

2272
02:06:46,940 --> 02:06:51,650
which is a way back in the 90s the
last girl, the crazy wild Bush.

2273
02:06:51,651 --> 02:06:54,560
It's like my Dick. I don't
Rub Bra. It was horrible.

2274
02:06:54,561 --> 02:06:55,760
It was like fucking a Brillo pad.

2275
02:06:55,830 --> 02:06:57,390
It's,
it shouldn't be.

2276
02:06:57,600 --> 02:07:02,510
It shouldn't be a fucking
like Dow and I show,

2277
02:07:02,540 --> 02:07:05,240
I'm sure he could explain it while we
have Harry nuts and bolts and stuff,

2278
02:07:05,300 --> 02:07:07,410
but pbk should die out.

2279
02:07:07,590 --> 02:07:10,860
They reckon crabs is dying out because
of the shaving pussy that it's on the

2280
02:07:10,861 --> 02:07:12,970
decline because it can't
be passed so easily.

2281
02:07:13,100 --> 02:07:16,540
But you know it's on the rise
and hipster beards. Crabs.

2282
02:07:16,970 --> 02:07:20,420
That's where they live now. They just
jump from one Pabst Blue Ribbon Kansas.

2283
02:07:20,430 --> 02:07:23,550
Isn't that true? No, that would
be cool because it's Christ.

2284
02:07:26,010 --> 02:07:30,570
I hate out. Hipsters now call themselves
nerds. They do. Yeah. It's, well,

2285
02:07:30,571 --> 02:07:33,020
it's like even like case I'm doing,
I got nothing.

2286
02:07:33,030 --> 02:07:36,940
I'm doing the notice podcast sooner. I
these guys, Chris Hardwick's a nice bloke.

2287
02:07:36,970 --> 02:07:39,340
He's a nice guy. Not a nerd. No.

2288
02:07:39,341 --> 02:07:43,630
He's a handsome guy with a very handsome
guy with like a model girlfriend.

2289
02:07:44,630 --> 02:07:49,630
Not being interested in star wars
does not make you a fucking nerd.

2290
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:55,360
Heavy hobbies isn't what a nerd is.

2291
02:07:56,020 --> 02:07:58,870
Symmetrical face.
You know what a nerd is?

2292
02:07:58,900 --> 02:08:03,250
A nerd is a person who can't hold down
a conversation and can't look a woman in

2293
02:08:03,251 --> 02:08:05,260
the eye. That's a fucking nerd, man.

2294
02:08:06,780 --> 02:08:10,660
Your Napoleon dynamite. The
Polian darn amount, isn't it?

2295
02:08:10,730 --> 02:08:13,660
Even the guys off of, uh, the
Big Bang theory, they illness,

2296
02:08:13,900 --> 02:08:17,380
but these now these like girls going,
girls wearing tee shirts going,

2297
02:08:17,470 --> 02:08:22,090
I heart nerds. Really, really a guy
with a fucking club foot and, and, and,

2298
02:08:22,660 --> 02:08:25,450
and flaky skin around his
face. Is this, are you hot?

2299
02:08:25,500 --> 02:08:30,430
Does it guy with food stuck in
his braces? Patchouli, yeah. Who,

2300
02:08:30,431 --> 02:08:33,250
who is a little bit autistic and
that's why he's good at school,

2301
02:08:33,251 --> 02:08:36,880
but not at everything else. Yeah. You like
that? Yeah. That's, that's what you like.

2302
02:08:36,910 --> 02:08:39,080
How dare you? No, you, you like,

2303
02:08:39,670 --> 02:08:43,720
you like wearing a fucking backpack that
looks like Elmo. That's what you enjoy,

2304
02:08:43,721 --> 02:08:47,770
darling. You're like, Hello Kitty
stickers on your iPhone. Yeah, yeah,

2305
02:08:48,520 --> 02:08:51,190
yeah. All right. And then like
you'll see like a girl would be like,

2306
02:08:51,250 --> 02:08:56,200
I'm a nerd and she's wearing perfect
pigtails and classes and I'm like,

2307
02:08:56,230 --> 02:08:58,860
you're a fucking fuck machine.

2308
02:09:00,990 --> 02:09:04,150
You're, you're a com depository.
That's hardly a nerd.

2309
02:09:04,180 --> 02:09:06,790
I remember not wanting to fuck
nerds because they were nerds.

2310
02:09:06,791 --> 02:09:10,360
Why all of a sudden as the nerd
culture becomes so fuckable well,

2311
02:09:10,420 --> 02:09:13,360
I think people are just always trying
to be a part of a fucking group,

2312
02:09:13,361 --> 02:09:17,080
whether it's be hipsters, be nerds, be
whatever they used the learner in school.

2313
02:09:17,081 --> 02:09:19,870
I didn't have many friends,
but I wouldn't classify myself as a nurse.

2314
02:09:19,900 --> 02:09:20,740
How can be now friends.

2315
02:09:21,760 --> 02:09:26,650
I had problems making friends
and the main problem I have now,

2316
02:09:27,030 --> 02:09:30,220
um, that I, I, when I look back
on it, I wasn't good at sport.

2317
02:09:30,320 --> 02:09:34,570
I'm a bit of a Dick as well as
a little bit,

2318
02:09:35,250 --> 02:09:38,710
probably two, probably talked a little
bit too much when I should have shut up.

2319
02:09:38,711 --> 02:09:40,930
You know,
my have been irritating.

2320
02:09:40,931 --> 02:09:45,250
But I think my main problem was because
I found it very easy to make friends

2321
02:09:45,251 --> 02:09:46,780
after school.
Once I got out of school,

2322
02:09:46,781 --> 02:09:49,030
I found it very easy to
make friends in university.

2323
02:09:49,031 --> 02:09:53,110
I made friends very easily and uh, my
mother was a school teacher at my school.

2324
02:09:53,710 --> 02:09:57,400
Oh, fucking Christ. Not
just any school teacher,

2325
02:09:57,401 --> 02:10:00,650
the 300 pounds skilled teacher that
yelled at everybody that walked around and

2326
02:10:01,780 --> 02:10:06,300
she got it at school and at home. Oh my
God. Cool. Must have been fucking torture.

2327
02:10:06,360 --> 02:10:10,600
Go is not a fun time. Oh my God. I
remember when I went to university,

2328
02:10:10,601 --> 02:10:13,930
like actually enjoying this whole,
wow, we're all these fucking, yeah,

2329
02:10:13,931 --> 02:10:16,330
and like girls liking me
and shit. I'm like, ah,

2330
02:10:16,331 --> 02:10:19,900
this is what it's like when your mother
isn't within five feet of you all the

2331
02:10:19,901 --> 02:10:24,010
time. Oh yeah. That's a big difference
though. That's a terrible situation.

2332
02:10:24,320 --> 02:10:27,700
You got your mother who's telling her
older brother to kick your fucking ass and

2333
02:10:27,701 --> 02:10:30,400
then you get to school and she's
the one that yells at everybody.

2334
02:10:30,590 --> 02:10:34,100
All your friends know that
your mom is the conti teacher

2335
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:34,933
that yells at her,
right?

2336
02:10:34,990 --> 02:10:37,570
Yeah. So none of your friends. I
had a couple of friends at school,

2337
02:10:37,571 --> 02:10:38,660
but they never wanted to come over

2338
02:10:38,710 --> 02:10:41,570
the hat.
You know what I mean?

2339
02:10:41,571 --> 02:10:44,120
Like it was a very hard sell.

2340
02:10:45,340 --> 02:10:48,590
What are you coming to
my house that's not,

2341
02:10:49,700 --> 02:10:50,810
let's just go to the woods.

2342
02:10:51,960 --> 02:10:55,700
Let's go hang out with the wallaby's
that's going out in the bush.

2343
02:10:57,790 --> 02:10:59,740
I have a foot fetish. Yeah, no,

2344
02:10:59,910 --> 02:11:00,431
I just wondering,

2345
02:11:00,431 --> 02:11:04,640
I just wondering if you had any like
mom type sexual mom's a foot, foot,

2346
02:11:05,060 --> 02:11:09,100
foot fetish. People have mom.
Yeah, cause they're, yeah,

2347
02:11:09,101 --> 02:11:12,010
cause as a young kid you always see
your mom, you see your mom's feet. Yeah.

2348
02:11:12,011 --> 02:11:16,330
But I disliked my bullet. Yeah, I
didn't, that's why I say if he had some,

2349
02:11:16,510 --> 02:11:21,150
all right. I uh, she, she's all
right. She's all right now. You,

2350
02:11:21,230 --> 02:11:23,510
I find I get a lot more,

2351
02:11:23,900 --> 02:11:28,640
I liked my mother more now that I've had
a child because she has proven herself

2352
02:11:28,641 --> 02:11:31,880
to be a good grandmother.
But uh,

2353
02:11:32,210 --> 02:11:35,360
but she was fucking hard work,
man. I used to say too, I said,

2354
02:11:35,361 --> 02:11:39,410
why did you make me go to the same
school that you are teaching it?

2355
02:11:39,411 --> 02:11:43,190
It was noise nearby school. And she
goes, well I was there first. I'm like,

2356
02:11:43,191 --> 02:11:45,710
are you competing with your fucking kids?
Go teach at the school.

2357
02:11:45,711 --> 02:11:46,960
Over the road there's,
there was,

2358
02:11:47,270 --> 02:11:49,040
there was an all girls
school just down the street.

2359
02:11:49,041 --> 02:11:52,100
I don't care if you teach with it a
school within a half a mile of where I am.

2360
02:11:52,490 --> 02:11:54,460
Well, I was there for,
I was at first place.

2361
02:11:54,461 --> 02:11:58,190
She just liked to keep
it honest constantly.

2362
02:11:58,980 --> 02:12:01,400
It's very dominating childhood.
Very good.

2363
02:12:01,650 --> 02:12:06,300
Look how you turned out you
flung the other way. That's
how it works. Yeah. I mean,

2364
02:12:06,330 --> 02:12:09,030
what we were talking about about you
having a hard time shutting up in school

2365
02:12:09,031 --> 02:12:11,910
and being a bit of a Dick. All those
things are perfect for being a comedian,

2366
02:12:12,330 --> 02:12:15,420
the comedian, a bit of a Dick
and talks a little too much.

2367
02:12:15,540 --> 02:12:18,070
That's the guy who's going to say
the funny shit first. Yeah, right.

2368
02:12:18,410 --> 02:12:19,160
I,
I,

2369
02:12:19,160 --> 02:12:24,080
you know what's weird now is I go back
to Sydney and all the guys I went to

2370
02:12:24,081 --> 02:12:26,450
school with who I, they probably
didn't think they were bullying me,

2371
02:12:26,451 --> 02:12:29,840
but who I felt bullied by
for whatever reason. Um,

2372
02:12:30,530 --> 02:12:34,100
they all come as a group to
my shows and they're like,

2373
02:12:34,130 --> 02:12:37,970
come and meet me backstage and they say,
oh, happy that I got to hold no grudges.

2374
02:12:38,160 --> 02:12:39,530
They're good guys.
You know what I mean?

2375
02:12:39,531 --> 02:12:42,320
But they weren't my mindset
school and I remember them.

2376
02:12:42,510 --> 02:12:47,060
I think kids get bullied at school for the
same reason. Survival. Yeah. Will they?

2377
02:12:47,340 --> 02:12:50,880
It's, it's, it's a natural instinct
and they get shitty parenting.

2378
02:12:50,940 --> 02:12:53,970
I think that's a lot of where it
comes from. They get bullied at home.

2379
02:12:54,150 --> 02:12:57,240
It becomes a natural part of how you
behave. You get bullied by your brothers,

2380
02:12:57,241 --> 02:12:59,790
get bullied by your dad,
get bullied by your uncles who,

2381
02:12:59,830 --> 02:13:03,360
and then the first opportunity you
get to shit on somebody you do.

2382
02:13:03,390 --> 02:13:07,620
It's a lot of it is kids that grow up
associating other people with competition

2383
02:13:07,621 --> 02:13:11,190
and abuse and you know,
they just associated in a negative way.

2384
02:13:11,480 --> 02:13:12,770
It was a,

2385
02:13:12,771 --> 02:13:17,270
the bit I found hardest about the
whole thing was fuck the guards.

2386
02:13:17,271 --> 02:13:18,590
I just want to chicks to log me.

2387
02:13:19,520 --> 02:13:20,930
Well that's why you got into comedy,
right?

2388
02:13:21,020 --> 02:13:22,430
Yeah.
Well I got into company growth,

2389
02:13:22,431 --> 02:13:26,300
so I actually did pretty good with girls
in high school. I look back on it now.

2390
02:13:26,510 --> 02:13:30,980
Photos of me, 1670 I was a good looking
kid. I didn't think it at the time,

2391
02:13:31,260 --> 02:13:32,040
but I look back on it

2392
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:33,820
like I wasn't bad looking at that age.
I did

2393
02:13:34,050 --> 02:13:35,100
good in high school,

2394
02:13:35,160 --> 02:13:39,330
but then after high school I went
through a fucking terrible drought.

2395
02:13:39,570 --> 02:13:42,420
That didn't,
didn't go away until I became a comic.

2396
02:13:42,860 --> 02:13:47,540
Oh No, I did. I bet she is for high
school and university. Really? But I,

2397
02:13:47,660 --> 02:13:51,320
I was getting it attract
the never go at my school.

2398
02:13:51,321 --> 02:13:54,200
It was always I had to
go see other schools,

2399
02:13:54,650 --> 02:13:57,170
find out where their parties
were happening to get light.

2400
02:13:57,320 --> 02:14:00,130
Oh, so girls that knew you,
it was a problem. Yeah. Yeah.

2401
02:14:01,120 --> 02:14:04,390
Yeah. If you'd spent, if you spent
more than 10 minutes with me,

2402
02:14:04,391 --> 02:14:06,040
you were fucking with me.
But if I could,

2403
02:14:06,850 --> 02:14:10,150
if I could meet you at a party where the
music was too loud that I couldn't bore

2404
02:14:10,151 --> 02:14:12,910
you with conversation, there was a
good chance that I have sex with you.

2405
02:14:12,980 --> 02:14:17,980
I didn't get laid at all in college and
the reason being is I took a year off

2406
02:14:18,021 --> 02:14:20,510
after high school and
then went to Umass Boston,

2407
02:14:20,511 --> 02:14:22,100
which was like a commuting high school.

2408
02:14:22,340 --> 02:14:26,210
It was not a high school where you are
not a college rather community college.

2409
02:14:26,330 --> 02:14:29,810
It wasn't a college where you a was
to go and stay there, you would,

2410
02:14:30,020 --> 02:14:31,580
you would live somewhere else,
you know,

2411
02:14:31,581 --> 02:14:33,470
and then you would go and
take your classes there.

2412
02:14:33,650 --> 02:14:36,790
So everybody was like working
and I was a loser, you know,

2413
02:14:36,910 --> 02:14:40,060
I didn't have anything going on. I was,
I was a martial arts champion, but I was,

2414
02:14:40,120 --> 02:14:43,280
I was poor and I was teaching
martial arts and I was trying,

2415
02:14:43,400 --> 02:14:46,020
the only reason why I was
going to school at all, well,

2416
02:14:46,040 --> 02:14:47,420
so that people didn't
think I was an idiot.

2417
02:14:48,020 --> 02:14:51,500
I studied musical theater. Did you? Yeah.

2418
02:14:51,590 --> 02:14:54,980
So you've got to bang actresses.
It was the best. It was.

2419
02:14:55,790 --> 02:14:59,360
It was like they only took 20
kids a year into the course.

2420
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:03,980
3000 people auditioned. Whoa. Right.
It was like a very prestigious thing.

2421
02:15:03,981 --> 02:15:08,750
It was the same course of Hugh Jackman
did and there was an acting paper.

2422
02:15:08,751 --> 02:15:11,060
I couldn't, not good enough. So
I got, I knew I could sing a bit.

2423
02:15:11,061 --> 02:15:15,040
So I got in the musical theater thing
and I could back in the day. Yeah.

2424
02:15:15,050 --> 02:15:19,670
You sing now. No soundtrack
to legit. I'll tell you.

2425
02:15:19,730 --> 02:15:23,690
I'll tell you something
about me. You might not know.
It's a little fact about me.

2426
02:15:23,750 --> 02:15:26,420
I Sang,
I sang twice in the Australian opera,

2427
02:15:26,430 --> 02:15:31,220
in the course as an employed opera
singer. Yeah. Wow. I was like,

2428
02:15:31,230 --> 02:15:35,510
what? Kinda like what I wasn't, I
wasn't. I've had, I've had vocal nodules.

2429
02:15:35,510 --> 02:15:39,720
I've had surgery and my voice, I can't,
it's over. I'm not making up though. I,

2430
02:15:40,070 --> 02:15:44,330
I sang in a child's Bruno's Romeo and
Juliet and Wagner as the flying Dutchman

2431
02:15:44,390 --> 02:15:49,310
as chorus vocal nodules, um,
pull ups on your vocal chords.

2432
02:15:49,340 --> 02:15:52,490
Basically calluses from smoking coke.

2433
02:15:52,491 --> 02:15:56,780
A yelling is mostly from yelling from
the bashing together. They get calluses.

2434
02:15:56,781 --> 02:15:59,870
So you can't actually get your vocal
cords close enough together to make high

2435
02:15:59,871 --> 02:16:02,240
sounds because there's always a gap
in them from these little things.

2436
02:16:02,300 --> 02:16:06,860
So it makes you a man, it's
like a noodles. A fucking
man is what it is. Yeah.

2437
02:16:06,861 --> 02:16:10,370
Well I guess,
yeah,

2438
02:16:11,840 --> 02:16:13,070
exactly.
It's like these,

2439
02:16:13,180 --> 02:16:15,860
these grisled comedians who have
yelled on stage all the time.

2440
02:16:15,861 --> 02:16:17,960
It's because they that just covered like,
you know,

2441
02:16:17,961 --> 02:16:22,430
what else is bad comedy like
Bobby slight and Paul up top.

2442
02:16:22,431 --> 02:16:27,260
I'm telling you that guy, his vocal
cords is just, just a nodular,

2443
02:16:27,261 --> 02:16:30,250
nodular. I'm telling you, he
might've had a vocal surgery

2444
02:16:30,340 --> 02:16:32,690
if I'm, I might be wrong, but I've,

2445
02:16:32,691 --> 02:16:34,660
I've heard of comedians
that have had that before.

2446
02:16:34,720 --> 02:16:36,550
It's more than why I had this before.

2447
02:16:36,551 --> 02:16:39,970
I was a Canadian to try
to save the singing curry.

2448
02:16:40,060 --> 02:16:42,120
So he had surgery on
the polyps. Yeah. Yeah.

2449
02:16:42,160 --> 02:16:45,670
So they shaved down the council couldn't,
couldn't talk for a,

2450
02:16:45,700 --> 02:16:48,580
couldn't talk for two minutes.
Oh my God. Two months. Yeah.

2451
02:16:48,581 --> 02:16:52,930
Just riding on a fucking pad. Oh, that
was when I, that was when I thought,

2452
02:16:53,170 --> 02:16:53,801
this job,

2453
02:16:53,801 --> 02:16:57,340
I'm going to get these back because I
partied too much and then I thought,

2454
02:16:57,341 --> 02:17:00,850
I've got no other skills. I got no
other skills in the fucking world.

2455
02:17:01,300 --> 02:17:04,300
And I decided I always
wanted to be a comedian,

2456
02:17:04,301 --> 02:17:08,110
but it wasn't a job that my parents
would never let me do or let you do that.

2457
02:17:08,111 --> 02:17:08,771
He said it wasn't,

2458
02:17:08,771 --> 02:17:11,770
my parents were happy with the musical
theater because they saw my mother could

2459
02:17:11,771 --> 02:17:14,650
brag and act like it was a bit more light.
He die then the whole thing.

2460
02:17:14,920 --> 02:17:17,650
But I decided I was going to be a comedian
in that two months where I couldn't

2461
02:17:17,651 --> 02:17:22,600
talk. Wow. And it was like a
secret that I had to myself. Like,

2462
02:17:22,601 --> 02:17:24,880
that's fucking awesome.
And I'd already,

2463
02:17:24,881 --> 02:17:28,310
I was like checking out what were
the open mics were in Howard.

2464
02:17:29,180 --> 02:17:33,700
I started watching a lot of standup
videos and, and that's what I did,

2465
02:17:33,880 --> 02:17:36,550
you know, living by myself, not
talking for a couple of months.

2466
02:17:36,610 --> 02:17:39,400
That's fucking awesome. And, uh,

2467
02:17:40,510 --> 02:17:44,260
what was I talking about before with the,
uh, the great thing about the cost day,

2468
02:17:44,680 --> 02:17:48,530
so 10 boys, 10, 10 girls. Uh,

2469
02:17:48,580 --> 02:17:52,990
and there was two, two years above us,
so it was three years. So there was,

2470
02:17:53,050 --> 02:17:58,050
it was like 90 people in the
whole sort of department half,

2471
02:17:58,360 --> 02:18:02,650
uh, 80% of the men would
guy right in the course.

2472
02:18:02,770 --> 02:18:06,760
Let's study musical theater. So we had
eight guy guys and to heterosexuals,

2473
02:18:07,780 --> 02:18:11,650
all the women were fucking hot as fuck.

2474
02:18:12,410 --> 02:18:13,010
We're like,

2475
02:18:13,010 --> 02:18:17,040
like been dancing since I was a kid and
just seeing in fucking they would just,

2476
02:18:17,290 --> 02:18:22,060
and we were all like 20.
It was the best thing ever.

2477
02:18:22,061 --> 02:18:25,840
I didn't even, I is the reasonable
looking fucking heterosexual guy.

2478
02:18:26,050 --> 02:18:27,880
It was fantastic.

2479
02:18:28,330 --> 02:18:33,330
Now one of the main girls
in the course was a go cold.

2480
02:18:33,550 --> 02:18:34,030
Uh,

2481
02:18:34,030 --> 02:18:38,830
Shantelle Barry and Chantel was going
was the one that we were all like,

2482
02:18:38,831 --> 02:18:42,150
she's going to be a star.
She was stunning. You can
look her up in the night.

2483
02:18:42,190 --> 02:18:46,630
She was fucking stunning. She could sing
better than everyone else. She could.

2484
02:18:46,650 --> 02:18:49,000
She was,
she had everything is go right.

2485
02:18:49,870 --> 02:18:54,870
And then they brought out
the first version of like
pop bottle or American idol

2486
02:18:55,571 --> 02:18:59,980
or whatever that it was done in Australia
first and was called miking the band

2487
02:18:59,981 --> 02:19:03,550
or whatever the show is actually
originated in New Zealand.

2488
02:19:03,550 --> 02:19:05,170
But then in Australia
they might just go bang,

2489
02:19:05,171 --> 02:19:09,340
called Bardo were all the people came in
and auditioned to be in his girl band.

2490
02:19:09,360 --> 02:19:10,840
And the goal that I was at university,

2491
02:19:10,841 --> 02:19:14,770
she went to this audition for this TV
show she got in the band but they played

2492
02:19:14,771 --> 02:19:16,750
it over weeks and weeks and weeks
and they'd cameras in the house.

2493
02:19:16,751 --> 02:19:18,520
And it was the first reality,

2494
02:19:18,521 --> 02:19:23,290
big reality show ever where
we were watching these
people just living in a house

2495
02:19:23,320 --> 02:19:27,320
and people couldn't fathom within,
there's no act as this is real.

2496
02:19:27,321 --> 02:19:31,520
It was like a very, there she
is there. Yeah. Anyway, so uh,

2497
02:19:31,850 --> 02:19:35,680
I used to stand behind her stretching
and dance class every and just fuck it.

2498
02:19:35,690 --> 02:19:40,010
Just all I wanted was to have sex with
this young lady never happened. Right.

2499
02:19:40,910 --> 02:19:41,431
So anyways,

2500
02:19:41,431 --> 02:19:46,170
so she gets in this band and
she stills the story guys.

2501
02:19:46,170 --> 02:19:50,270
She stills on a 10 or $20 out of one of
the other girls who were in the bands a

2502
02:19:50,420 --> 02:19:54,110
bag and she gets caught cause
it's fucking cameras everywhere.

2503
02:19:54,440 --> 02:19:55,790
So she's got this big opportunity.

2504
02:19:55,791 --> 02:19:59,210
Everyone else who was in this band has
gone on to big things like Sophie monk

2505
02:19:59,211 --> 02:20:02,600
who's the model out here dated Ryan
Secrets for while she was one of the other

2506
02:20:02,601 --> 02:20:06,170
girls in the band and now does big
modeling in his movies and Shit. Right?

2507
02:20:07,280 --> 02:20:08,061
So he shan't tell,

2508
02:20:08,061 --> 02:20:12,800
gets kicked out of the
fucking bank right over right.

2509
02:20:12,801 --> 02:20:15,200
So she moves over.
She's bad press in Australia.

2510
02:20:15,201 --> 02:20:17,630
They're all really slagging
her off and what type of stuff?

2511
02:20:17,960 --> 02:20:20,070
She was sort of a friend and she,

2512
02:20:20,130 --> 02:20:24,080
she moved over to La and I remember
like looking at a myspace page like wow,

2513
02:20:24,081 --> 02:20:27,920
she's made in la. She was backup singing
for Lionel Richie or something. Right?

2514
02:20:27,921 --> 02:20:30,380
Like got everything worked out for,
right.

2515
02:20:31,220 --> 02:20:33,770
Cut to first season of legit.

2516
02:20:34,130 --> 02:20:38,270
We need a girl in a sane that
he's just hot girl number two,

2517
02:20:39,350 --> 02:20:43,310
right. She comes into the audition. I
went, fucking hell. Shantelle Berry.

2518
02:20:43,490 --> 02:20:47,350
She didn't recognize me or remember
me at all. And I said, oh wait,

2519
02:20:47,351 --> 02:20:50,420
where's your accent from him? And then I
started saying the suburb she was from,

2520
02:20:50,720 --> 02:20:52,610
if I'm at this and you have
two older sisters. Yeah.

2521
02:20:52,611 --> 02:20:53,900
You look like someone who has two oldest,

2522
02:20:54,110 --> 02:20:56,330
cause I used to potty
at a house as this goes,

2523
02:20:56,380 --> 02:20:59,900
I got you got a butterfly
tattoo just above your ass.
Just stuff to, and she goes,

2524
02:21:00,050 --> 02:21:03,710
yeah. And I, when I went away,
went to university together.

2525
02:21:04,820 --> 02:21:08,360
Right. And then she went, oh did we find,
and then I went, oh I give her the pot,

2526
02:21:09,140 --> 02:21:11,180
right.
Because I'm a good guy.

2527
02:21:11,750 --> 02:21:15,440
The pot had like one line
and then she came on set.

2528
02:21:15,920 --> 02:21:19,100
And I think in that moment,
this is how much of an ocelot must be.

2529
02:21:19,130 --> 02:21:23,240
She remembered who I was from school
when she came on,

2530
02:21:23,241 --> 02:21:26,050
since he came on set, she was
like, cause Jim Jeffrey, I,

2531
02:21:26,070 --> 02:21:30,050
my real last name is Nugent.
I use my middle name as a
stage name because of Ted.

2532
02:21:30,470 --> 02:21:34,780
No, I just did. Jim Jefferies sounded
better than Jim Nugent. Jim Jeffrey,

2533
02:21:34,790 --> 02:21:38,720
you know what I mean? It was just, it
was a little tiny thing to alliteration,

2534
02:21:38,721 --> 02:21:42,800
you know, so she, I wasn't
going by my original name,

2535
02:21:42,801 --> 02:21:43,880
so she had no reason to her.

2536
02:21:44,180 --> 02:21:47,080
And then I sort of reminded and I said
how he used to come over and your mommy's

2537
02:21:47,090 --> 02:21:49,310
to make this type of food and blah
blah blah blah blah blah blah.

2538
02:21:50,960 --> 02:21:54,470
I think she was so pissed off
that I made it and she didn't.

2539
02:21:54,710 --> 02:21:59,480
But I had my own TV show that uh, she
went up to the producer and went, ah,

2540
02:21:59,481 --> 02:22:02,060
I've got food poisoning. I need to
go home and just walked off the set.

2541
02:22:02,390 --> 02:22:06,500
What didn't even do the job?
Maybe she's just kinda little squirt.

2542
02:22:06,530 --> 02:22:07,363
Maybe she had to leave.

2543
02:22:08,680 --> 02:22:12,130
Really didn't take the Gig man.

2544
02:22:12,620 --> 02:22:15,830
What makes you think that it's
because of that? I just think it's,

2545
02:22:17,150 --> 02:22:20,180
I just think people get fucking
jealous man. We all get jealous.

2546
02:22:20,181 --> 02:22:21,350
I think she just was like,

2547
02:22:21,530 --> 02:22:25,920
fuck this can cause I was
the guy at university that
you thought wouldn't make it

2548
02:22:26,430 --> 02:22:28,740
all the other gay guys at
abs or what type of stuff.

2549
02:22:28,741 --> 02:22:31,980
And I was like a bit of a doorway fucking
marshmallow looking kind of who could

2550
02:22:31,981 --> 02:22:35,610
sing a little bit. He couldn't dance at
all and was acting was pretty average.

2551
02:22:35,850 --> 02:22:38,550
They always kicked out like five
people a year from the course,

2552
02:22:38,551 --> 02:22:39,480
like you're not good enough.

2553
02:22:39,960 --> 02:22:43,740
I left after I got the nodules and I knew
I was going to get kicked out anyway.

2554
02:22:43,920 --> 02:22:48,570
That was already rot on the cods. I walked
before I, I jumped before I was pushed.

2555
02:22:48,890 --> 02:22:52,070
That competitive thing of show business
is one of the weirdest aspects of it.

2556
02:22:52,250 --> 02:22:54,740
Yeah.
Sometimes even in relationships.

2557
02:22:54,741 --> 02:22:58,430
I had a friend who got something in his
girlfriend started crying when he got

2558
02:22:58,431 --> 02:23:02,000
some part in some TV show
and his girlfriend started
crying because she was like,

2559
02:23:02,030 --> 02:23:06,140
well, something to happen for me.
Like that was her immediate reaction.

2560
02:23:06,710 --> 02:23:08,480
And I remember thinking,
wow,

2561
02:23:08,600 --> 02:23:11,570
I gotta get rid of that. But it's
something that's about to happen to you.

2562
02:23:15,790 --> 02:23:19,600
Yeah. That had very unattractive,
that competitive thing.

2563
02:23:19,650 --> 02:23:22,440
Yeah. I, you can't help it
a little bit with comedy.

2564
02:23:22,560 --> 02:23:25,780
It's very hard to never have it
with any other stope colleague.

2565
02:23:25,800 --> 02:23:29,120
There's always going to be one
where you go, that guy. But I, I,

2566
02:23:29,500 --> 02:23:33,600
I found out now and I think it's
easier because I got a bit of success,

2567
02:23:33,601 --> 02:23:36,930
but I don't give a shit what any,
I just worry about me.

2568
02:23:36,960 --> 02:23:40,530
I don't give a fuck if someone's going a
movie or something. I don't give a fuck.

2569
02:23:40,531 --> 02:23:43,330
I just worry about me. And
then you know, the good guys,

2570
02:23:43,331 --> 02:23:47,760
you know the bad guys and that's it.
But when in the early days it was more,

2571
02:23:47,761 --> 02:23:50,880
I got more jealous at how's
that going at that club?

2572
02:23:50,970 --> 02:23:52,680
I'm going to try and get
into that club forever.

2573
02:23:52,810 --> 02:23:55,180
That's just the frustration
of not having made it yet.

2574
02:23:55,181 --> 02:23:57,190
And then once you have
and you got some success,

2575
02:23:57,280 --> 02:23:59,200
it goes away and then you
can actually enjoy it.

2576
02:23:59,920 --> 02:24:00,040
Well,

2577
02:24:00,040 --> 02:24:03,050
I think there's successful people who
are still fucking don't want any other.

2578
02:24:04,650 --> 02:24:04,801
Well,

2579
02:24:04,801 --> 02:24:08,520
there's a lot of successful people also
that only work with terrible comedian so

2580
02:24:08,521 --> 02:24:09,354
that they shine.

2581
02:24:09,540 --> 02:24:12,180
Have you ever seen like a really good guy
who brings like the fucking worst guys

2582
02:24:12,181 --> 02:24:13,700
ever on the road to open forum,

2583
02:24:14,120 --> 02:24:18,900
torches the audience for a half an hour
with the worst fucking Shit standup ever?

2584
02:24:19,050 --> 02:24:21,570
Just so they can come in and clean
up the show and look like a hero.

2585
02:24:21,920 --> 02:24:24,330
And that's really what it is.
They don't want anybody to shine.

2586
02:24:24,380 --> 02:24:29,150
That's a very, we'd a
common, yeah, it's common,

2587
02:24:29,151 --> 02:24:33,950
but it's, I always sang,
I like, he's uh, uh,

2588
02:24:33,980 --> 02:24:37,700
chase the dream that the competition.
It's a good saying. You know what I mean?

2589
02:24:37,701 --> 02:24:40,550
Cause if you're worried about the
competition, you'll always feel,

2590
02:24:40,880 --> 02:24:44,800
it's like people who get angry at fucking
Aziz Ansari, like, who the fuck can,

2591
02:24:45,320 --> 02:24:47,420
you know what I mean? Who
gets angry with Daca? I,

2592
02:24:47,470 --> 02:24:51,430
there's plenty of comics who don't think
he deserves. What does that mean though?

2593
02:24:51,480 --> 02:24:55,610
What does deserve, these are
the, this is my thing. Well,

2594
02:24:55,850 --> 02:24:57,260
whether you like him or not,

2595
02:24:58,040 --> 02:25:01,640
you're not a little tiny Indian
bloke who's a little bit hip hop.

2596
02:25:02,150 --> 02:25:04,970
So at least the guys unique,
he's not stepping on your fucking toes.

2597
02:25:04,971 --> 02:25:07,160
I'm never admin another can't lock him.
In the comedy community,

2598
02:25:07,500 --> 02:25:10,080
it's that zero sum thing that people have.

2599
02:25:10,081 --> 02:25:12,510
This idea that there's
a finite amount of gigs,

2600
02:25:12,511 --> 02:25:14,400
there's a finite amount
of audience members.

2601
02:25:14,401 --> 02:25:18,750
And if Jim Jefferies becomes
big and that takes away from me.

2602
02:25:18,990 --> 02:25:22,530
I've had people accuse me of being
like a foreigner coming over,

2603
02:25:22,531 --> 02:25:26,720
taking American jobs. That's hilarious.
Who did that? Had a few comic.

2604
02:25:27,100 --> 02:25:31,840
Oh No,
they're not people you'd know.

2605
02:25:31,841 --> 02:25:32,480
Anyway

2606
02:25:32,480 --> 02:25:34,910
cares. Name them. So
we don't ever know him.

2607
02:25:35,130 --> 02:25:39,870
Sorry. There's a radio station in
tamper that got into me about that.

2608
02:25:39,960 --> 02:25:44,200
Oh my God, that's so sad. I said that
I'd come over and fucking America,

2609
02:25:44,220 --> 02:25:47,490
it might be famous and blah blah. I
should look. I give back to America, man.

2610
02:25:47,491 --> 02:25:51,930
I say my show employees over a hundred
people and I've written it. I produced,

2611
02:25:51,931 --> 02:25:53,790
this is a recent thing. Yeah. Yeah.

2612
02:25:53,791 --> 02:25:57,210
And I said my TV show our employees over
a hundred different people in different

2613
02:25:57,211 --> 02:25:59,850
jobs. Right. And then he went, we'll,

2614
02:25:59,851 --> 02:26:02,090
if you didn't do it then an American
would do it and you're like,

2615
02:26:02,160 --> 02:26:05,450
it doesn't matter mate. I did a
true, oh I did. It doesn't matter.

2616
02:26:05,900 --> 02:26:08,300
But that's not true.
That that idea is not true.

2617
02:26:08,301 --> 02:26:12,380
The idea that if you didn't make that
show, someone else would make that Shelby.

2618
02:26:12,381 --> 02:26:14,360
And now this show, it's
place, so something,

2619
02:26:14,370 --> 02:26:16,420
I don't know who the fuck
knows what it would be.

2620
02:26:16,440 --> 02:26:19,340
Might not employ as many people.
It might not be a drama.

2621
02:26:19,341 --> 02:26:22,500
It might be a reality show that
employs very few people works nonunion.

2622
02:26:23,030 --> 02:26:25,490
You know that, that, that
attitude is so stupid.

2623
02:26:25,660 --> 02:26:30,340
All right. It's all started. A
whole immigrant thing that you get,

2624
02:26:30,341 --> 02:26:31,960
and I got it in the UK as well,

2625
02:26:32,200 --> 02:26:36,510
is we're all fucking immigrants.
Exactly.

2626
02:26:36,850 --> 02:26:39,010
Everyone ready states is a
hundred percent immigrants. Yeah.

2627
02:26:39,180 --> 02:26:43,240
100% immigrants or the
children of immigrants. Yeah.
That's how this was made.

2628
02:26:43,270 --> 02:26:44,200
Unless you're native American

2629
02:26:44,250 --> 02:26:47,580
and they say 80% of all
businesses in America now, uh,

2630
02:26:47,640 --> 02:26:51,570
either from immigrants or the sons and
daughters, first generation immigrant,

2631
02:26:51,740 --> 02:26:55,210
even if you're on native American, that
means you came over on the Bering strait.

2632
02:26:55,220 --> 02:26:58,520
Your great, great, great, great
grandfather walked here from fucking Asia.

2633
02:26:58,890 --> 02:27:01,640
Is that why it happened? I didn't
even need, that's very fascinating.

2634
02:27:01,641 --> 02:27:02,840
And native American,

2635
02:27:02,900 --> 02:27:07,070
I mean less you're talking about native
Americans at were they have their DNA

2636
02:27:07,071 --> 02:27:07,761
combined.

2637
02:27:07,761 --> 02:27:12,500
Like Mexicans is a lot of native Americans
that had sex with Spaniards like way,

2638
02:27:12,501 --> 02:27:14,840
way, way, way back in
the day. But when you,

2639
02:27:14,980 --> 02:27:17,540
when they do the DNA
chart of native Americans,

2640
02:27:17,541 --> 02:27:19,880
one of the things they found
when they were researching,

2641
02:27:19,881 --> 02:27:23,000
there was a guy who was a
Mormon, a hardcore Mormon,
and he's a really rich guy.

2642
02:27:23,001 --> 02:27:27,350
And he wanted to prove that Joseph Joseph
Smith was correct and everything that

2643
02:27:27,351 --> 02:27:30,500
he said in the Bible was true and that
the native Americans were the lost tribe

2644
02:27:30,501 --> 02:27:34,070
of Israel. So we mapped out the,
the genome of the native Americans.

2645
02:27:34,071 --> 02:27:36,980
It turns out they're from Siberia.
So they came down,

2646
02:27:36,981 --> 02:27:38,700
they walked when it was a solid land map.

2647
02:27:38,810 --> 02:27:43,670
They've got sort of Siberia.
Is that near Mongolia?

2648
02:27:43,800 --> 02:27:46,080
No. Well, Siberia is Russia.

2649
02:27:46,780 --> 02:27:51,690
Russia's sort of near it in the fact
that the Mongols actually invaded, uh,

2650
02:27:51,691 --> 02:27:54,620
they in, they invaded a Russia
and some that go with g.

2651
02:27:54,800 --> 02:27:58,140
If you, I've traveled the fucking world
and I don't know anything. Well, it's saw

2652
02:27:58,510 --> 02:28:00,790
that's all in the same, I mean,
you wouldn't want to walk there,

2653
02:28:00,910 --> 02:28:02,740
but I mean it's all on the same land mass.

2654
02:28:04,470 --> 02:28:08,100
All snow. It's all suck.
Like very soft. Shoveling.

2655
02:28:08,110 --> 02:28:11,490
The fucking driveways get what? The
happiest Shit we're in the tennis, right?

2656
02:28:11,491 --> 02:28:12,880
Well I reckon the happiest place on earth,

2657
02:28:12,960 --> 02:28:17,040
Denmark or something and it's like
highest tax bracket and, and you know why?

2658
02:28:17,041 --> 02:28:19,740
It's because the most content people,
maybe not the happiest,

2659
02:28:19,741 --> 02:28:23,030
most content people in in Denmark
because it gets fucking docket three.

2660
02:28:23,750 --> 02:28:25,520
And that is,

2661
02:28:27,290 --> 02:28:30,800
you don't even dream about being
a famous movie star or a musician.

2662
02:28:30,801 --> 02:28:33,020
There's no entertainment
business that comes out of it.

2663
02:28:33,410 --> 02:28:36,500
You have to keep your dreams that
know I slow level in Denmark.

2664
02:28:37,010 --> 02:28:39,380
So you never get crushed by
the world. The world. Never.

2665
02:28:39,560 --> 02:28:42,230
You never have a girlfriend going,
when's it gonna Happen For me?

2666
02:28:42,560 --> 02:28:45,590
All you have is people sitting around
Denmark going, oh, well, you know,

2667
02:28:45,591 --> 02:28:50,090
on Saturday we're going to have a drink,
aren't we? So I'll see. I'll see. Hans,

2668
02:28:50,091 --> 02:28:52,700
that'll be fun.
That's as much as your dreams.

2669
02:28:52,701 --> 02:28:56,810
Get to Saturday having a beer
with your buddy. You know,

2670
02:28:56,920 --> 02:28:58,640
you never get ahead of yourself.

2671
02:28:58,930 --> 02:29:02,860
There's a Werner Herzog documentary on
Siberia called happy people life in the

2672
02:29:02,861 --> 02:29:05,320
taiga. It's about all these
people that live up there.

2673
02:29:05,321 --> 02:29:09,760
Virtually no mental illness, lot of
fucking really content happy people.

2674
02:29:09,940 --> 02:29:14,260
All they do is fish and trap and hunt.
That's all they do.

2675
02:29:14,500 --> 02:29:15,160
It's all they do.

2676
02:29:15,160 --> 02:29:19,600
They trade like skins and
meat and fish for you know,

2677
02:29:19,630 --> 02:29:21,510
fucking chainsaw blades.

2678
02:29:21,570 --> 02:29:23,440
Cause that's the thing is,
you know when you go fishing,

2679
02:29:23,441 --> 02:29:28,000
there's very few people that can
fuck you over in your day. It's true.

2680
02:29:28,030 --> 02:29:29,530
You go work in an office,

2681
02:29:29,830 --> 02:29:32,500
you're getting fucked over by
people who were smiling at you.

2682
02:29:33,120 --> 02:29:37,200
Well you're also dealing with unbelievably
unnatural behavior sitting in a box,

2683
02:29:37,260 --> 02:29:38,970
the same box every day,

2684
02:29:39,090 --> 02:29:43,890
eight hours a day plus and commuting
and all day you're sitting and you're

2685
02:29:43,891 --> 02:29:46,260
fucking, he. There's no
physical movement at all.

2686
02:29:46,261 --> 02:29:49,980
There's nothing explosive going on
with your body. No use of your senses.

2687
02:29:50,160 --> 02:29:51,180
No fight or flight.

2688
02:29:51,750 --> 02:29:55,640
So say that.
It's like the bullying thing that you see.

2689
02:29:55,670 --> 02:29:56,780
You see these people who were,

2690
02:29:56,810 --> 02:30:01,090
when you first walk into ca
where assistance and they
sat in the front thing and

2691
02:30:01,091 --> 02:30:04,430
I'd always have a jar of m and m's and
they'd be like, Hey Jim, great to see you.

2692
02:30:04,431 --> 02:30:05,900
Oh, here's some evidence.
Here's the water.

2693
02:30:06,820 --> 02:30:09,800
Like the happiest person in the world
I'm going to have in the world. Oh.

2694
02:30:10,280 --> 02:30:13,430
And then they'll have that con that sat
behind him that used to just call them a

2695
02:30:13,431 --> 02:30:16,460
piece of shit cause they got
their coffee order wrong. Right.

2696
02:30:16,461 --> 02:30:19,220
And then they'd go home and cry even
though they smiled to you because it was

2697
02:30:19,221 --> 02:30:20,054
part of their job.

2698
02:30:20,390 --> 02:30:24,080
And then the second I get to move into
that back a little room and they get a

2699
02:30:24,081 --> 02:30:26,780
person up there, they're fucking
telling that person there or can't,

2700
02:30:26,781 --> 02:30:30,590
they can't get coffee to save their life
within the circle of life. Never ends

2701
02:30:30,730 --> 02:30:33,220
that Kevin Spacey Movie. Uh, which one?

2702
02:30:33,490 --> 02:30:36,670
The Kevin Spacey movie where he's
like the worst fucking employee ever,

2703
02:30:36,671 --> 02:30:38,050
or the employer ever.

2704
02:30:38,051 --> 02:30:42,190
He's like an agent and he hires some
guy and they wind up kidnapping him.

2705
02:30:42,790 --> 02:30:46,510
What was that moving? Kevin's Beth
fucking shit. I can't remember that movie.

2706
02:30:47,020 --> 02:30:51,820
Kevin Spacey.
Agent movie.

2707
02:30:52,480 --> 02:30:53,550
Yeah,
he's a fucking car.

2708
02:30:53,690 --> 02:30:58,280
Please. I got to get gone. I got to get to
the doctor's guys. Oh, is that a problem?

2709
02:30:58,310 --> 02:31:00,680
No, we've done never problem
problems. Two and a half hours.

2710
02:31:01,120 --> 02:31:03,850
I just want to tell people what
this fucking movie has. God dammit,

2711
02:31:04,870 --> 02:31:07,840
uh,

2712
02:31:09,880 --> 02:31:10,713
horrible bosses.

2713
02:31:11,490 --> 02:31:12,450
That's not the movie.

2714
02:31:12,451 --> 02:31:16,890
That's another movie that he made that
was based around the original first movie.

2715
02:31:18,990 --> 02:31:20,280
Find it.
Find

2716
02:31:20,280 --> 02:31:25,190
a Chamie. Find it before
we wrap up. That's your
assignment. Funding neighbor. Uh,

2717
02:31:25,330 --> 02:31:29,190
that's not a sign that wasn't there movie
called Kangaroo Jack or something? You,

2718
02:31:29,210 --> 02:31:30,710
yeah.
Yeah.

2719
02:31:30,720 --> 02:31:34,530
There was definitely that kangaroo
jack to my girlfriend at the moment.

2720
02:31:34,531 --> 02:31:38,610
Can't leave the house because we lived
just Jamie said swimming with sharks.

2721
02:31:38,611 --> 02:31:41,790
That's exactly what it is. Yeah.
That's fucking great. That's a,

2722
02:31:41,791 --> 02:31:42,690
that's a great movie.

2723
02:31:42,691 --> 02:31:46,940
We see what kind of a terrible
environment that agent environment is.

2724
02:31:46,941 --> 02:31:50,370
It's the worst. Oh, that's the one where
he sweat. I've seen the speech out of it.

2725
02:31:50,371 --> 02:31:52,440
There's a torches.
This young kid that works for him.

2726
02:31:52,770 --> 02:31:54,900
I used to have a girl that I
dated that worked for an agent.

2727
02:31:54,930 --> 02:31:57,060
She'd wake up in the middle of
the night freaking out like that.

2728
02:31:57,061 --> 02:32:01,190
She forgot to do something in the
middle and he was brutal. He was just,

2729
02:32:01,320 --> 02:32:05,880
that's like every occupation must have
that where you wake up and they're like,

2730
02:32:06,290 --> 02:32:10,290
oh, I forgot to ah shit.
Yeah, but it's a 24 hour job.

2731
02:32:10,320 --> 02:32:14,670
What about like the bloke who,
who put bolts on engines for GM?

2732
02:32:15,920 --> 02:32:18,830
Well, there's obviously this inspectors
at handle that along with, yeah,

2733
02:32:18,850 --> 02:32:22,200
but it just takes a couple of people that
have a bad dice simultaneously. Yeah.

2734
02:32:23,640 --> 02:32:24,990
This girl though, uh, this,

2735
02:32:25,050 --> 02:32:28,500
this Gig of being an assistant to
an agent was literally all day.

2736
02:32:28,501 --> 02:32:30,960
Like he would call her up in the
middle of the night. I need eggs,

2737
02:32:30,961 --> 02:32:32,940
I don't have any eggs. Go get me
some eggs, bringing in my house.

2738
02:32:33,270 --> 02:32:36,000
Like he would have to, she would
have laundry shoot up to pick up.

2739
02:32:36,001 --> 02:32:39,600
Like it was all day, every day, just
made shit money barely could survive.

2740
02:32:39,870 --> 02:32:42,030
And it was all day on,
on call.

2741
02:32:42,070 --> 02:32:46,480
If you're watching this live,
don't go to Laurel Canyon right now.

2742
02:32:46,680 --> 02:32:49,770
Why is that? If I am, well I am, I go
for as to why I live in Mount Olympus.

2743
02:32:49,800 --> 02:32:53,440
My girlfriend has to walk up the fucking
hill and pocked ricotta and the bottom

2744
02:32:53,470 --> 02:32:57,870
end of the road, which is like a mile up
the hill, know what's going on. There's a,

2745
02:32:57,880 --> 02:33:02,880
there's a cop being shot in a Laurel
Canyon and the guys barricaded himself in

2746
02:33:04,661 --> 02:33:08,610
his house. It was domestic uh,
thing and there is a standoff.

2747
02:33:08,670 --> 02:33:12,400
I heard about that this morning. That's
still going on. Well she just texts me,

2748
02:33:12,401 --> 02:33:14,680
don't drive down this way
because she's woken up the hill.

2749
02:33:15,700 --> 02:33:19,020
All right folks, uh, watch
Jim Jeffrey show legit.

2750
02:33:19,050 --> 02:33:21,270
It's on Fx FX.
Fx

2751
02:33:21,410 --> 02:33:24,720
Two X is we want to explain to them
at a six parody. What happened there?

2752
02:33:24,780 --> 02:33:28,180
Why did it go well?
They like comedy,

2753
02:33:28,230 --> 02:33:30,210
got a new channel and they
had to move so and so.

2754
02:33:30,211 --> 02:33:33,900
I sunny in Philadelphia in the league
or moved over and they've got some back

2755
02:33:34,350 --> 02:33:37,620
alley g's on after our show.
That's beautiful. How is it?

2756
02:33:37,890 --> 02:33:41,300
I heard the allergy one is a lot of his
old stuff too. That was a, the itch.

2757
02:33:41,480 --> 02:33:44,250
It's all this stuff that I had in England
that never had over here with this

2758
02:33:44,251 --> 02:33:48,690
whole show, um, with different intros
and stuff like that. Ah, beautiful.

2759
02:33:48,720 --> 02:33:51,510
It's really, it's repackaged at
that one, but that's on after me.

2760
02:33:51,511 --> 02:33:55,140
Don't worry about that. Worry
about budget. What time is legit?

2761
02:33:55,141 --> 02:33:58,890
When should they watch? It's at
10. Unless you have a direct TV,

2762
02:33:58,891 --> 02:34:02,430
which means it goes forward to seven
because you get them west coast feed.

2763
02:34:02,430 --> 02:34:05,760
But yeah, it's 10 o'clock east
coast. It's 10 o'clock east coast.

2764
02:34:05,790 --> 02:34:09,830
Do you enjoy working for Fxx?
Love it. Oh good. Yeah. Yeah.
It's beautiful. Beautiful.

2765
02:34:09,990 --> 02:34:13,550
Beautiful. All right. Legit. Watch it.
Um, you don't have a podcast anymore?

2766
02:34:13,551 --> 02:34:16,830
Stop doing that. No, I do not have a
podcast at the present moment. I'm on the,

2767
02:34:16,831 --> 02:34:21,520
I'm on tour at the moment. If a you
watching them doing a this Saturday,

2768
02:34:21,521 --> 02:34:23,440
I will be at a club,

2769
02:34:23,441 --> 02:34:28,030
Nokia in La and I'm somewhere
in San Francisco this
Friday. You don't even know.

2770
02:34:28,450 --> 02:34:32,200
I think they're both sold out, but
just check anyway. Check your flux.

2771
02:34:32,230 --> 02:34:36,040
I tried to go to a website. Mary's
fucking standup comic. Hey, I'm on to,

2772
02:34:36,050 --> 02:34:39,310

Australia? Very popular in Australia.

2773
02:34:39,650 --> 02:34:44,080
I will be touring the entire month of
April across Australia or major cities for

2774
