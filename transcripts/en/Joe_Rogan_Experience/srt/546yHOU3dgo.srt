1
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:08,880
I can't tell a story about taking this
shit without 90 people hitting me up the

2
00:00:08,881 --> 00:00:11,580
next day telling me that was the
most brilliant story in the world.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,100
Want to send it to Tom and I?

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:14,550
Tom,

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,000
I tell her ain't on the shit.

6
00:00:16,001 --> 00:00:16,530
Kind of make it.

7
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:17,570
Oh my God.

8
00:00:17,571 --> 00:00:18,200
That was dumb.

9
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,500
I took a shit in favor in his backyard
after a five hour drive from Colton or

10
00:00:22,501 --> 00:00:23,340
some weird town.

11
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:27,630
Did he not talk to you after that for
awhile I took a shit and then he ran over

12
00:00:27,631 --> 00:00:30,090
it with his car and the
whole back yard smartly.

13
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:31,551
I go,

14
00:00:31,551 --> 00:00:33,690
what did that meg a day he goes,

15
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,190
it smells back here.

16
00:00:35,191 --> 00:00:36,060
Let's walk in the house.

17
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,100
I don't know what happened.

18
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:43,310
As you can see the brown shit smooshed
it with this tire and a bunch of flyers.

19
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:52,410
Talk to me for a month after
that in some of these backyards

20
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,350
because I told him the truth.

21
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:56,760
I felt bad,

22
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:57,990
but I lied to the guy

23
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:01,320
that's hard to clean up too.

24
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:02,070
Wow.

25
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:02,281
Yeah.

26
00:01:02,281 --> 00:01:02,581
Shit.

27
00:01:02,581 --> 00:01:03,810
You can clean up dog shit.

28
00:01:03,811 --> 00:01:04,910
It doesn't mean make you gag,

29
00:01:04,911 --> 00:01:06,300
but human shit bomb shit.

30
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:06,730
Yeah.

31
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:06,880
Oh,

32
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,340
it smells so much stronger,

33
00:01:08,341 --> 00:01:09,174
man.

34
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:10,020
It's so much.

35
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:10,170
No,

36
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:10,360
no,

37
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:10,880
no.

38
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,530
Take a shit until you cut it in half,

39
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:14,403
right.

40
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,080
No one that fucking,

41
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,190
I think it was that Reese's
peanut butter fume leaks out.

42
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:21,960
Oh my God.

43
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:22,381
He's like,

44
00:01:22,381 --> 00:01:23,240
I've done studies.
