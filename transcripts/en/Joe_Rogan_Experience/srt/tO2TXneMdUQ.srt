1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:02,460
Whoa,

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,293
Whoa,

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:04,370
whoa.

4
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:05,250
You forgot where you were.

5
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:06,210
Yeah.

6
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,043
This is a,

7
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,090
this is the original spot.

8
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,590
And in the original spot,

9
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:11,873
uh,

10
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,050
now known as desk quad.

11
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,080
East east has cats and for some reason
Brian has decided that squad west is a

12
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,890
primate based.

13
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,740
It's all the monkeys and scary thing to.

14
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:27,180
Right.

15
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:27,421
Well,

16
00:00:27,421 --> 00:00:29,970
the studio itself definitely
has a different feel.

17
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:30,451
You know,

18
00:00:30,451 --> 00:00:33,630
with the Werewolf when you walk into
the place that's this extraordinary

19
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:33,990
feelings.

20
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:34,441
Awesome.

21
00:00:34,441 --> 00:00:34,950
It is awesome.

22
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,750
The coolest thing I've
ever bought in my life.

23
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:37,830
Powerful Pat Mcgee,

24
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,680
guy from a pat mcgee special effects.

25
00:00:40,681 --> 00:00:41,310
He makes them.

26
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,180
You can order one.

27
00:00:42,181 --> 00:00:42,930
I didn't going to order one.

28
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:43,770
Before you got married,

29
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,250
your house would have at least seven

30
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,740
different when you live
with the chicken man.

31
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:52,230
They start moving your shit around and
putting pictures of your kids on the

32
00:00:52,231 --> 00:00:52,771
wall.

33
00:00:52,771 --> 00:00:55,200
And I used to have champs
up all over my house.

34
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,230
If you went over to my house
when I was a single mom,

35
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,113
not going to do.

36
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:02,810
I used to have pictures
of champs everywhere in
sculptures to weird sculptures

37
00:01:02,811 --> 00:01:03,644
or weird shit.

38
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,480
Like literally you would walk around
his whole entire house and there'd be a

39
00:01:06,481 --> 00:01:09,810
monkey or a chimp every five
steps or be a different picture.

40
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,990
Really eating a tiger or when chimps.

41
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,681
Eaton Tigers.

42
00:01:13,681 --> 00:01:15,980
But I got them like
how long chasing after.

43
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,370
How long were you rocking that though?

44
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:18,481
Oh Man.

45
00:01:18,481 --> 00:01:20,910
I've been obsessed with
chimpanzees since I was a baby.

46
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,690
So even like a teenager
style you were doing?

47
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,121
Oh yeah.

48
00:01:24,121 --> 00:01:25,770
I've always been obsessed with apes.

49
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,120
You just asked with them.

50
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:28,920
I find them fucking fascinating.

51
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,370
My,

52
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:32,210
my production company's name
is talking monkey incorporate.

53
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:32,560
Yeah,

54
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,120
sure.

55
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:38,120
I got that was in like 1988 and that
was a line I stole from a movie with um,

56
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,430
the fuck was that dude's name.

57
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,650
I forget his name.

58
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,980
Oh God.

59
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,710
Harman Mark Harmon thing.

60
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:52,410
That was his.

61
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:54,000
He had a funny movie,

62
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,010
like a summertime moving carmen.

63
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,400
Okay.

64
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,510
It was like summer school
or some shit like that.

65
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,560
And I'm teaching summer
school and he said to guy,

66
00:02:01,561 --> 00:02:03,390
if you lose one more brain cell,

67
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:04,650
you'd be a talking monkey.

68
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:10,010
And I remember that all the sudden put
in my head the idea of a talking Michael,

69
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:14,160
like how stupid would a person
have to be if we really did evolve?

70
00:02:14,161 --> 00:02:17,700
How far back would we have to go
until we became a talking monkey,

71
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,703
you know,

72
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:19,703
what is that?

73
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:20,830
And so that became.

74
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:21,760
I mean,

75
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,080
it wasn't.

76
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,670
That was my initial obsession,

77
00:02:23,671 --> 00:02:27,100
but that's why I named my company
talking monkey in corporate.

78
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,920
I can see how an obsession with monkeys.

79
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,260
They're so fascinating,

80
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:30,750
man.

81
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,800
If they didn't exist,

82
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,110
we would be tripping the fuck out if we.

83
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:38,040
If someone showed you have newer no
chimpanzees and all of a sudden we found

84
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,390
chimpanzee somewhere would be like,

85
00:02:39,391 --> 00:02:40,740
holy shit.

86
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:41,341
Look at them.

87
00:02:41,341 --> 00:02:41,941
They're looking at you.

88
00:02:41,941 --> 00:02:42,774
They're thinking,

89
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,321
oh my God,

90
00:02:43,321 --> 00:02:44,250
they using tools.

91
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,660
Holy Fuck.

92
00:02:45,661 --> 00:02:46,471
Look at this.

93
00:02:46,471 --> 00:02:48,450
This is like a window back in time.

94
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,600
This is like the fucking sensory
deprivation tank and altered states.

95
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,730
We can see our past.

96
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:54,331
I mean,

97
00:02:54,331 --> 00:02:55,650
you literally can see your past.

98
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,270
I mean somehow or another.

99
00:02:57,271 --> 00:03:00,280
I don't understand that
evolution scientifically,

100
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:00,971
behaviorally.

101
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:01,260
That wasn't.

102
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,260
When I talk like this.

103
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:02,740
People said,

104
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:02,981
well,

105
00:03:02,981 --> 00:03:04,960
you really don't understand
how evolution works.

106
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:05,651
Okay,

107
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:07,030
I appreciate that,

108
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:11,110
but I think you can reasonably
extrapolate that if people exist,

109
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,940
and then there was some early people,

110
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,860
there was like no homo,

111
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:15,783
whatever.

112
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,990
It was like a bunch of different homos,

113
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,640
Homo ostrow,

114
00:03:20,641 --> 00:03:21,190
Paleo,

115
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:21,960
osteopathic,

116
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,310
this thing Australia pivot that was a,

117
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:28,150
that one tube or direct
ancestors that they believe.

118
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,390
It's like somehow or another we
had to be like more primitive.

119
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,220
It wasn't like we just started out like,

120
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,810
like close to a human now.

121
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,670
There were some steps
along the way you fuck.

122
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,391
Okay.

123
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:40,300
And I think it's not unreasonable
to look at chimpanzees and say,

124
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,250
even though that's not
our step along the way,

125
00:03:42,251 --> 00:03:43,960
it's from a different
branch of the same tree,

126
00:03:43,961 --> 00:03:45,040
the same prime a tree.

127
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:48,910
I think you can reasonably extrapolate
that there's something very similar to

128
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:50,680
the way they are that we probably were,

129
00:03:50,681 --> 00:03:51,310
you know,

130
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,510
at least we can put it together.

131
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,130
Then in a rang of tanks and Bonobos,

132
00:03:54,131 --> 00:03:57,730
we can mix them all together and try to
figure out what the fuck we were like.

133
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,760
There's different models that have come
along before humans can see class and

134
00:04:02,961 --> 00:04:04,840
there was an easy class and
then there's the s class.

135
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:05,883
You know what,

136
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,460
fuck,

137
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:06,761
fuck.

138
00:04:06,761 --> 00:04:08,080
Commercials for this podcast.

139
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,060
I don't feel like doing any commercials.

140
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,310
This is like a podcast
that came out of nowhere.

141
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,600
We didn't even see this coming.

142
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,493
Tommy buns.

143
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,820
We put it together last minute,

144
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,980
so no commercials.

145
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:18,850
Suck it,

146
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,051
suck it.

147
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:23,290
Please move on and let's just get going.

148
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:24,970
Brian Red Band,

149
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,250
work in the Mick Rock,

150
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,490
rocking the discs,

151
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,473
turning the tape

152
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:32,483
experience.

153
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,710
Joe Rogan podcast.

154
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,520
Ladies and gentlemen,

155
00:04:40,521 --> 00:04:41,354
Tommy Buns.

156
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,590
Now this podcast,

157
00:04:42,591 --> 00:04:45,200
maybe the first podcast series ever plays.

158
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,390
Will you get the full podcast?

159
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,140
Seriously?

160
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:51,080
They don't have to edit that because
we don't have a commercial in it.

161
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:51,471
Oh,

162
00:04:51,471 --> 00:04:51,980
that's great.

163
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,050
So people don't know is that um,

164
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:57,330
I'm financially irresponsible and uh,

165
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,360
I,

166
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,410
I'm not that good at advertising shit.

167
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,070
Right?

168
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,290
And a lot of times when we do our podcast,

169
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:06,470
the advertisements may take as long
as 20 minutes because somewhere in the

170
00:05:06,471 --> 00:05:07,304
advertisements,

171
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:07,581
you know,

172
00:05:07,581 --> 00:05:07,881
Brian,

173
00:05:07,881 --> 00:05:10,820
callum might bring up some crazy fucking
book that he read and all the sudden

174
00:05:10,821 --> 00:05:15,350
we're on this wild journey or Duncan
trussell blows your mind with a certain

175
00:05:15,351 --> 00:05:20,270
thought in the middle of a commercial
talking about something and now you're off

176
00:05:20,271 --> 00:05:21,170
on a tangent path.

177
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,890
But a lot of that shit never makes
it to Sirius satellite radio.

178
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:28,910
I even think isn't the show like an hour
long to like they just edit it down to

179
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:29,744
an hour.

180
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:30,170
I don't know.

181
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,460
But it's awesome that
they put us on there.

182
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,140
It's a,

183
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:36,140
I'm happy to be on there because it's
opie and anthony or my friends and there's

184
00:05:36,141 --> 00:05:36,471
a,

185
00:05:36,471 --> 00:05:37,190
it's just,

186
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,480
it's a good group of humans,

187
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:38,970
you know?

188
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:39,711
They're good guys.

189
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,790
Jim Norton is a great guy.

190
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,010
I love being associated with those guys.

191
00:05:43,011 --> 00:05:43,430
You know those,

192
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,150
those guys.

193
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,990
I'm down for them.

194
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,353
Everybody said my friend.

195
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:47,181
It seems like a good crew,

196
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:47,540
man.

197
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,231
They're great guys,

198
00:05:48,231 --> 00:05:48,650
man.

199
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:48,771
I,

200
00:05:48,771 --> 00:05:50,950
Anthony's beautiful human being ops,

201
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,550
a fucking awesome guy.

202
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,720
Awesome.

203
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,510
Jim Norton is like one of
my favorite humans ever,

204
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:57,470
you know,

205
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,880
so it's like all of them together.

206
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,130
We have some great conversations,

207
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,730
you know,

208
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:05,390
they're not dumb guys by any stretch of
the imagination even though I disagree

209
00:06:05,391 --> 00:06:07,160
with some of them ideologically,

210
00:06:07,161 --> 00:06:08,660
like sometimes I disagree with Anthony.

211
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,420
He's real strong like
right wing Republican,

212
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:12,980
but he's also,

213
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:15,170
I believe in a lot of
things that he believes in.

214
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,460
There's a lot of shit that I believe in,

215
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:17,960
especially like the gun control issue,

216
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,150
you know?

217
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,990
I mean he's a bit extreme,

218
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,560
you know,

219
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:21,890
he's,

220
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:24,210
he's a crazy gun nut and he has guns.

221
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:31,150
But I honestly believe that when you
see the shooting victims and all,

222
00:06:31,731 --> 00:06:32,900
all these different things,

223
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,000
this is not a gun issue.

224
00:06:35,001 --> 00:06:36,470
It's a mental health issue.

225
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,630
It's the ability to do that.

226
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,900
That should be so alien from our society.

227
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,720
And I liken it to a
group of close friends.

228
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:45,643
Okay.

229
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,840
And this is obviously an exaggeration.

230
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:50,330
It's really hard to do when you're
talking about giant society of people that

231
00:06:50,331 --> 00:06:51,620
are never going to get to meet each other.

232
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:54,200
But in a group of close friends like us,

233
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:55,243
the people in this room,

234
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:55,910
okay,

235
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:58,910
let's pretend that we were
all on a desert island.

236
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:01,610
What are the odds that one of us
would become a suicide bomber?

237
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,280
Came pretty fucking small,

238
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,390
right?

239
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,810
It's pretty fucking small planes.

240
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,290
Does someone become a suicide bomber?

241
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,300
How does someone become a guide?

242
00:07:11,301 --> 00:07:14,480
Would drop a bomb off at
a marathon finishing line.

243
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,830
How does someone do that?

244
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,380
What?

245
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:16,690
What?

246
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:17,150
What?

247
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:20,750
What the fuck happens to that
guy that lets you do that?

248
00:07:20,751 --> 00:07:25,190
Because the reality is that there's a
lot of shit that can kill people in this

249
00:07:25,191 --> 00:07:25,550
world,

250
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:28,070
including cars and everyone has cars.

251
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:32,510
And if you want it to kill far more
people than this guy did at the marathon,

252
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,280
you could run over people in your car.

253
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,600
The reason he did it this way is because
he wanted to not be accountable for it.

254
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,980
He thought he could get away with it.

255
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:40,430
Sure.

256
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,211
If this is the,

257
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:41,511
you know,

258
00:07:41,511 --> 00:07:42,770
if you buy the official story,

259
00:07:42,771 --> 00:07:43,850
I'll Alex Jones.

260
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,470
Have you bought the official story?

261
00:07:45,471 --> 00:07:46,310
Ladies and gentlemen?

262
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,010
But if you,

263
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:49,461
you know,

264
00:07:49,461 --> 00:07:52,220
you look at this guy like who
they're claiming this guy is,

265
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:52,760
that was the,

266
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:52,931
the,

267
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:53,870
the older brother,

268
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:56,780
they think he might've
committed three murders as well.

269
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,830
Three murderers out there.

270
00:07:58,850 --> 00:07:59,091
Yeah.

271
00:07:59,091 --> 00:08:00,560
There was one night,

272
00:08:00,561 --> 00:08:04,250
three people were murdered and one of
them was a close friend and training

273
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:09,251
partner of this guy and the body's
cash was left there and the bodies were

274
00:08:09,591 --> 00:08:10,910
covered with marijuana.

275
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:12,020
Yeah.

276
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,240
And this guy was very
religious apparently,

277
00:08:14,241 --> 00:08:15,074
and become,

278
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:19,550
he'd become more and more religious
in the past few years now again,

279
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:21,950
settled down tinfoil people.

280
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:22,371
This is,

281
00:08:22,371 --> 00:08:24,020
if you buy the official story,

282
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,580
I don't know what the fuck this dude was,

283
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,121
you know,

284
00:08:26,121 --> 00:08:26,690
I'm just,

285
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:29,540
I'm just reading what I'm getting out of.

286
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:29,961
You know,

287
00:08:29,961 --> 00:08:33,980
essentially almost all news
sources seem to be agreeing with,

288
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:37,640
with these stories that this
guy was like super religious.

289
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:37,891
Well,

290
00:08:37,891 --> 00:08:38,360
he went,

291
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,580
he got kind of radicalized
that a couple of years ago.

292
00:08:40,581 --> 00:08:43,640
He went back to to rush us for six months.

293
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:44,930
Say That's when he,

294
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,360
he came back and radicalize,

295
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:47,890
you know,

296
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:48,470
that's again,

297
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,610
that's the official story.

298
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:53,150
Jones will tell you it
was a false flag event.

299
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:53,950
Tommy,

300
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,270
what they're doing it or trying to
take away your guns were supposedly he

301
00:08:57,271 --> 00:08:58,560
listened to Alex Jones.

302
00:08:58,561 --> 00:08:59,880
He was a fan of infohort

303
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,240
when maybe he was a fan of infant wars.

304
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:05,160
The way I'm a fan of Sean Hannity,

305
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,950
like I'll listen just because
it's fucking hilarity.

306
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,680
It's funny to watch people
twist the narrative like that.

307
00:09:10,681 --> 00:09:15,580
It's funny to watch people that are just
so blatantly right wing that they'll

308
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:20,430
never admit anyone on
the left has any idea.

309
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:25,580
It's always any even compliment is said
with a smirk that soon to follow some

310
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,100
disparaging remark about who they are.

311
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:33,630
It's never like Obama's a brilliant man
or even if it's even if it's an idea

312
00:09:33,631 --> 00:09:35,140
that they were behind it,

313
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,300
there's still a spin on it,

314
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,680
so it's a.

315
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,450
it's a fucking game.

316
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:43,470
They're in a team and they strategize
to get that team to win and they do it

317
00:09:43,471 --> 00:09:44,101
within the rules,

318
00:09:44,101 --> 00:09:45,840
but they know they're full of shit.

319
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:46,890
Like as they're doing it,

320
00:09:46,891 --> 00:09:47,880
you can hear their voice.

321
00:09:47,881 --> 00:09:48,930
They know they're full of Shit,

322
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,480
but the game is so screwy.

323
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,330
It's one of those games that doesn't
make any sense like baseball.

324
00:09:54,331 --> 00:09:56,310
Why the fuck do they dress like that?

325
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,510
Look how you're dressed.

326
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:02,460
Look at what those stupid fucking
tights and what is that outfit?

327
00:10:02,461 --> 00:10:03,211
What is that?

328
00:10:03,211 --> 00:10:03,780
Those signs,

329
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,280
they've always dressed like that.

330
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:05,790
Goddammit.

331
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,623
They're stuck.

332
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:10,980
They're stuck with a stupid outfit back
from when people didn't have newspapers.

333
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,080
That's when they made
that dumb ass outfit.

334
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,790
That outfit's retarded.

335
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,111
It is.

336
00:10:15,111 --> 00:10:16,050
It's ridiculous.

337
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,220
It's ridiculous.

338
00:10:17,221 --> 00:10:18,240
It's stupid as fuck.

339
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,010
It puts me in the tiers to watch that game

340
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:22,471
while it's fun.

341
00:10:22,471 --> 00:10:23,304
Game to play.

342
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,163
But sure,

343
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:27,450
the butt getting stuck in
that old shit like that.

344
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,800
That's the only reason
why politicians are,

345
00:10:29,801 --> 00:10:31,950
are able to get away with
the way they communicate.

346
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:32,491
I can't.

347
00:10:32,491 --> 00:10:37,491
I can't imagine being a person who is
into politics like really into it and

348
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:39,510
like,

349
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:39,930
you know,

350
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,480
not be cynical and be like,

351
00:10:42,481 --> 00:10:44,490
it's so disheartening to follow politics.

352
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:44,971
To me,

353
00:10:44,971 --> 00:10:45,660
it just,

354
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,730
it absolutely kills the soul.

355
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:48,510
No one,

356
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,020
man.

357
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,250
I recognize it as.

358
00:10:50,251 --> 00:10:52,050
I would kinda come an older man.

359
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,460
I recognize it for what it is.

360
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,360
It's an act.

361
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:54,900
Right?

362
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,440
You know,

363
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,930
and you know why I know
because I do an act two,

364
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,490
I know what an act is like.

365
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,930
I know when I'm doing standup,

366
00:11:00,931 --> 00:11:01,764
when I stand up,

367
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:02,820
I'm going to,

368
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:03,541
if you know,

369
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:04,920
if I want to do my best,

370
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,340
what I do is I ad libbed quite a bit,

371
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:13,050
but I also have some key components that
I have broken down into pretty specific

372
00:11:13,051 --> 00:11:13,884
ways of saying it,

373
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:14,160
right?

374
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,350
Because that's the best way
that it has the most response,

375
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,030
but I'm trying to tell jokes.

376
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,240
When you hear a person give a speech and
they have that weird sorta artificial

377
00:11:25,171 --> 00:11:26,790
quality to the way they're talking,

378
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,650
we should reject that.

379
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,573
Yes.

380
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,600
I completely agree.

381
00:11:30,601 --> 00:11:31,680
We shouldn't let them do that.

382
00:11:31,681 --> 00:11:32,100
Yeah.

383
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:32,600
We should be like,

384
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,380
just talk.

385
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,800
Talk like a normal person.

386
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:35,663
Yeah.

387
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,500
What are you doing about the budget,

388
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:38,541
you know,

389
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:43,140
and have the budget yet an important
priority of this administration.

390
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:47,620
It's something we think about every day.

391
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:48,490
Oh,

392
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:49,550
what the fuck are you?

393
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,630
What you guy was talking to you like that?

394
00:11:51,631 --> 00:11:52,380
You'd be like,

395
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,460
stop,

396
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,010
stop,

397
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:54,830
asshole.

398
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:55,700
You know who else does that,

399
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,650
that exact speech.

400
00:11:56,651 --> 00:11:57,400
Do that,

401
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,640
that type of language
comes from corporate world.

402
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,503
If you were like,

403
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:02,860
if you talked to a guy and you're like,

404
00:12:02,861 --> 00:12:05,920
I had a bad experience at your offices,

405
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:06,823
he'd be like,

406
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,570
you know,

407
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:10,630
every time a customer comes
into one of our establishments,

408
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:11,171
they want that.

409
00:12:11,171 --> 00:12:13,150
We want them to have opportunity.

410
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,520
We want them to have choices
and what you'd be like,

411
00:12:15,521 --> 00:12:17,320
what the fuck are you talking about?

412
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,333
That's corporate.

413
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,940
Like it's not how humans stop.

414
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:21,581
Exactly.

415
00:12:21,581 --> 00:12:23,800
But you can hear the training video.

416
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:26,350
You get that sometimes when
you go now when they go,

417
00:12:26,351 --> 00:12:28,360
do you want to sign up for the um,

418
00:12:28,361 --> 00:12:29,950
the special extra warranty?

419
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:30,520
You Go,

420
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:30,950
I don't know.

421
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:31,540
They go,

422
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:31,721
well,

423
00:12:31,721 --> 00:12:32,350
you know,

424
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,390
when I had my computer
a couple of years ago,

425
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:37,000
I knocked a bottle of coke over.

426
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,110
I love coke.

427
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,610
And it left the thing.

428
00:12:39,611 --> 00:12:40,930
And because of the warranty,

429
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,120
they took care of it and you're like,

430
00:12:43,121 --> 00:12:45,630
that's a training speech.

431
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,970
They tell you to make a personal
story up and you're like,

432
00:12:48,971 --> 00:12:51,030
I know you're saying that to me right now.

433
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:55,750
So know that feelings when
someone's lying to you,

434
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:56,860
that when you're looking at them,

435
00:12:56,861 --> 00:13:00,450
when they're just straight bullshitting
you and they won't even look in the eye

436
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,570
looking down,

437
00:13:01,571 --> 00:13:04,480
looking around and panicking
as they bullshit you.

438
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,373
Sure.

439
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,820
There's the worst is if you
know somebody that can do the.

440
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,870
When you know they're lying
and they're not panicking,

441
00:13:10,871 --> 00:13:11,170
you're like,

442
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:11,381
oh,

443
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:12,350
you're a crazy person.

444
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:14,260
You're a fucking sociopath.

445
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,870
And that's a weird moment when you're
talking to a guy and you're like,

446
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,530
I'm not sure what you're playing this
game and I'm not wearing a hat right now.

447
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:21,101
You know what I mean?

448
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:21,934
I'm not wearing a hat.

449
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:24,430
And you see it on your head.

450
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:25,390
I don't.

451
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,290
I'm not where I'm with it.

452
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,040
Especially if they get
stuck in a bad situation.

453
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:31,263
Yeah.

454
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,300
They get stuck in some site
where they did something Douchey,

455
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:35,283
[inaudible],

456
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,373
you know,

457
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,673
like wow.

458
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:39,760
Crazy.

459
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,170
People are so strange.

460
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,700
It's so weird to run into someone
who just doesn't see things.

461
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,170
It is been like you.

462
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:52,200
You see the world and they see a gigantic
galactic conspiracy to ever tell you

463
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,220
about this comedian who
will remain nameless,

464
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,960
who came up to me and just start
showing me pictures on his iphone.

465
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:57,430
He's was like,

466
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,263
look at this,

467
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,231
and I'm looking at it.

468
00:13:59,231 --> 00:14:00,250
It's pictures of clouds,

469
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:00,821
right?

470
00:14:00,821 --> 00:14:01,654
I'm like,

471
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,220
I'm thinking of the
cat's beautiful clouds.

472
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:03,761
He goes,

473
00:14:03,761 --> 00:14:04,150
look at that,

474
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:04,983
look at that,

475
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,700
and we just keep doing this.

476
00:14:06,701 --> 00:14:08,470
He shows me like 10 of these and I go,

477
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,221
he's an older guy,

478
00:14:09,221 --> 00:14:10,480
so I'm trying to be considerate.

479
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:10,721
I'm like,

480
00:14:10,721 --> 00:14:11,170
yeah,

481
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:11,531
yeah.

482
00:14:11,531 --> 00:14:12,310
Wow.

483
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:12,910
Pretty cool.

484
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:13,743
And he goes,

485
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,021
you know,

486
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:15,400
I've been seeing them for years.

487
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:15,881
I go,

488
00:14:15,881 --> 00:14:16,121
well,

489
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:16,540
are they?

490
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:16,901
He goes,

491
00:14:16,901 --> 00:14:18,940
they're alien craft that goes,

492
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:19,774
these are Ufos.

493
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,070
They are.

494
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,650
They've been coming in various forms.

495
00:14:23,651 --> 00:14:24,161
I see them.

496
00:14:24,161 --> 00:14:25,390
I've been taking pictures of them.

497
00:14:25,391 --> 00:14:26,224
It's incredible that,

498
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:26,680
you know,

499
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,120
no one's paying attention
to this [inaudible].

500
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,410
This is a very strange thing.

501
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:30,161
And I'm like,

502
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:31,210
am I in a sketch?

503
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:31,671
I'm like,

504
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:33,200
because he fucking with me because if he,

505
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:33,520
you know,

506
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,290
he's a kind of a silly guy and I'm like,

507
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,130
if he's fucking with me,

508
00:14:36,131 --> 00:14:36,920
this will be kind of.

509
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,540
And then I realized,

510
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,291
Oh,

511
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:38,891
wait a minute,

512
00:14:38,891 --> 00:14:41,260
I'm dealing with someone
who's got a screw loose.

513
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:42,580
There's a screw.

514
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:43,570
It's not,

515
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,440
it's not worth supposed to be.

516
00:14:44,441 --> 00:14:45,760
He's not 100 percent crazy.

517
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,860
Like he's very functional
for the most part.

518
00:14:47,861 --> 00:14:48,120
He's,

519
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,180
I enjoyed talking to him.

520
00:14:49,181 --> 00:14:50,014
He's a nice guy,

521
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,650
but when it gets to,

522
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,590
he'll pull out his fucking iphone.

523
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,433
You gotta run,

524
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,510
you gotta get out of there because
you're going to be looking at pictures of

525
00:14:56,511 --> 00:15:00,830
clouds and he's gonna tell
you about spacecrafts that
have been contacting them.

526
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:01,963
Yeah.

527
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,780
And it's.

528
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,351
But other than that,

529
00:15:03,351 --> 00:15:03,801
he's normal.

530
00:15:03,801 --> 00:15:04,100
He goes,

531
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,570
do you like cheeseburgers
on cheeseburgers?

532
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:05,701
Yeah.

533
00:15:05,701 --> 00:15:05,870
Yeah.

534
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:06,510
Your fries.

535
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:06,670
Hey,

536
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,401
can you pass me the salt?

537
00:15:07,401 --> 00:15:07,941
Please show.

538
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:08,780
So what's going on man?

539
00:15:08,781 --> 00:15:09,141
How's that?

540
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:11,350
How's the road treat you like
you have a conversation with her.

541
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:12,400
Then if you get into,

542
00:15:12,401 --> 00:15:13,750
I know a guy like that and it's,

543
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,400
you think he's like a,

544
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:16,931
just being,

545
00:15:16,931 --> 00:15:17,231
like,

546
00:15:17,231 --> 00:15:19,480
I'm kind of a storyteller.

547
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,220
He starts telling us
stories and you're like,

548
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:24,640
there's a lot of exaggerations in
these stories and then you're like,

549
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,460
you know,

550
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,910
he kind of rambles on and on,

551
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:32,740
and then he switches topics like real
fast to have like a whole new story.

552
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:34,420
But it's about something like,

553
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,280
he's like,

554
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:35,471
you know,

555
00:15:35,471 --> 00:15:37,120
I got shot six times and you're like,

556
00:15:37,121 --> 00:15:37,720
what?

557
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:37,961
He's like,

558
00:15:37,961 --> 00:15:38,290
yeah.

559
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:39,130
So I was over,

560
00:15:39,131 --> 00:15:39,831
I was in the,

561
00:15:39,831 --> 00:15:40,250
um,

562
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,370
like the south in South Carolina.

563
00:15:42,371 --> 00:15:44,110
I was going past Columbia and I got it.

564
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:45,730
And it's a new story that
starts and you're like,

565
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:46,241
yeah.

566
00:15:46,241 --> 00:15:50,140
And then this guy helped me and then we
were up in the trees and then this guy

567
00:15:50,141 --> 00:15:52,960
pulled out a nine millimeter and he
has like everything and you're like,

568
00:15:52,961 --> 00:15:53,260
wait,

569
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,570
I thought we were talking about,

570
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,080
we're talking about fishing or something.

571
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,410
And then he goes back to like,

572
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,100
um,

573
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:00,331
yeah,

574
00:16:00,331 --> 00:16:00,660
you know,

575
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,170
when I went,

576
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:01,930
um,

577
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:03,010
I took a hot air balloon.

578
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,140
Oh,

579
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,570
I bought a hot air balloon company.

580
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,620
And number of years ago,

581
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,330
and I took this money that I got from
this investment into in mines and I bought

582
00:16:10,331 --> 00:16:12,730
this company that takes hot
air balloons up in the air,

583
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,670
is it costs me a quarter
million to get the startup.

584
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:15,131
And you're like,

585
00:16:15,131 --> 00:16:15,370
what?

586
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:15,700
You don't,

587
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,630
you make $10 an hour,

588
00:16:16,631 --> 00:16:17,464
what are you talking about?

589
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,810
Like it's just story after story.

590
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:20,770
Yeah.

591
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:21,250
And I'm like.

592
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:24,490
And then I start Kinda like
I don't know what to believe.

593
00:16:24,491 --> 00:16:28,420
And then part of it's fun to believe and
I start to think for a second I'll stop

594
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:28,870
and be like,

595
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:31,480
are you an improvisational
like genius or you like a,

596
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,700
like a brilliant Improv guy right now.

597
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,780
Is that what's going on?

598
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,270
Am I getting like played or something?

599
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:37,110
Pumped.

600
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:37,880
And then.

601
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,690
But then there's something you
see in the eyes where you're like,

602
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:41,351
oh,

603
00:16:41,351 --> 00:16:41,581
I don't,

604
00:16:41,581 --> 00:16:43,060
I really think there's,

605
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:43,690
there's,

606
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:44,230
maybe I'm,

607
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:49,230
I'm talking to somebody who has a
form of mental illness and I'm not,

608
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:50,650
it's not,

609
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:51,401
it's not the type.

610
00:16:51,401 --> 00:16:52,360
What makes you go like,

611
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:53,650
um,

612
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:54,040
I dunno,

613
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,470
like maybe more scare
or maybe like sillier.

614
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,550
Like it's not you.

615
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:00,910
He has all the intelligence and you can
talk about like what should we eat now

616
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:06,030
and you have a normal conversation about
that and then it goes off into like 10

617
00:17:06,071 --> 00:17:07,150
different storylines.

618
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,220
It's almost like it's his fault.

619
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:09,700
Yeah,

620
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,300
it's not.

621
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,140
It's not at that point.

622
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:11,441
Yeah.

623
00:17:11,441 --> 00:17:12,274
I don't know.

624
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:13,830
I don't know how your brain works,

625
00:17:13,831 --> 00:17:14,310
man.

626
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,143
You know,

627
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:15,931
what don't I,

628
00:17:15,931 --> 00:17:16,830
I'm guessing.

629
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,420
I always guess when people act like,

630
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:19,650
why the fuck did you do that?

631
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:23,700
Like I have to like stop
myself sometimes and go,

632
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,440
I don't know how his brain works.

633
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:28,770
My brain would process the same
scenario in a different way,

634
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:31,890
but maybe his brain
would handle some shit.

635
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:32,341
You know,

636
00:17:32,341 --> 00:17:33,900
that I can handle very well.

637
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,440
Yeah.

638
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:34,951
I don't know.

639
00:17:34,951 --> 00:17:35,940
I don't know how you think,

640
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:38,940
but I know when I see
someone who's just not,

641
00:17:38,941 --> 00:17:39,530
we're not.

642
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,280
There's a missing connection there.

643
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,750
Like I feel like this guy's like,

644
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:44,550
he's missing a whole piece.

645
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,930
Like what's going on here?

646
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:48,090
Sometimes you can see it from the moment,

647
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:48,361
right?

648
00:17:48,361 --> 00:17:49,510
Like there's some who.

649
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:50,080
Oh yeah.

650
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,940
At the moment you're like,

651
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:53,160
but it's scarier when you have long,

652
00:17:53,161 --> 00:17:56,360
normal conversations before that.

653
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,450
Then you're like,

654
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:57,900
what?

655
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,820
Like has this been there the whole time?

656
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:00,600
Yeah.

657
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:00,891
I've,

658
00:18:00,891 --> 00:18:05,040
I've talked to people and then like 20
minutes into the conversation you realize

659
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,510
that crazy [inaudible] yeah,

660
00:18:06,511 --> 00:18:06,930
like some,

661
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:08,460
some people it takes a little while.

662
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,140
Some people it's like right away.

663
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,130
Does the dangerous,

664
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:11,880
crazy,

665
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,271
dangerous,

666
00:18:12,271 --> 00:18:13,740
crazy have like sparks to them.

667
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:17,460
Like you'll just want to
back away from dangerous,

668
00:18:17,461 --> 00:18:17,940
crazy.

669
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,750
They give off an older kid.

670
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:20,670
You can't be dangerous.

671
00:18:20,671 --> 00:18:21,091
Crazy.

672
00:18:21,091 --> 00:18:23,550
Unless you have this like a certain
amount of danger to your odor.

673
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:24,990
You just feel weird.

674
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:25,891
It feel weird to be around.

675
00:18:25,891 --> 00:18:29,760
Every dangerous dude I've ever known
has a slight intangible odor about them.

676
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:30,420
You know?

677
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:30,991
You're just like,

678
00:18:30,991 --> 00:18:31,824
okay,

679
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,780
get the fuck Outta here.

680
00:18:33,781 --> 00:18:34,051
You know?

681
00:18:34,051 --> 00:18:35,760
There's those dudes.

682
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,030
Smells like the current farm.

683
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:37,870
Yeah.

684
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:39,590
It doesn't need more.

685
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,340
Yeah,

686
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,280
but not even.

687
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,320
That's dangerous.

688
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,290
Those are just silly
people for the most part.

689
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,390
It's just fucked up.

690
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:49,390
I feel like that with almost
with a super negative people,

691
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,260
the people that it's not
good for you to be around.

692
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:56,460
You pick up on additional vibes from,

693
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:57,150
you know,

694
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,320
like just being around them.

695
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:58,531
Yeah.

696
00:18:58,531 --> 00:18:59,191
You don't know what it is,

697
00:18:59,191 --> 00:18:59,371
right?

698
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:00,204
It's the smell.

699
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:01,740
It's not like they give off heat,

700
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,120
but if they leave,

701
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:06,450
like if you're just meeting them
and they leave the room and like,

702
00:19:06,451 --> 00:19:09,150
let's say you just brought
somebody in right when they leave,

703
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,110
you're like,

704
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:10,930
feel bums off with.

705
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:11,091
Yeah.

706
00:19:11,091 --> 00:19:11,341
And you go,

707
00:19:11,341 --> 00:19:12,180
something's off with that guy.

708
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:12,990
Absolutely.

709
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:17,010
She said their eyes for me because I
always look in the eyes for a second.

710
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,460
You can see like the worriness
or that friendliness sometimes.

711
00:19:20,461 --> 00:19:21,090
Yeah.

712
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:23,310
Or sometimes they just smell crazy.

713
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:29,120
I remember Brian Cowen had this chick
wants and he brought her over and I mean,

714
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:34,320
and I'm not bullshitting within
three seconds of meeting her,

715
00:19:34,321 --> 00:19:35,370
I knew she was nuts.

716
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:35,850
Really?

717
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:36,151
Yeah.

718
00:19:36,151 --> 00:19:36,580
Like he,

719
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,020
he brought her over and uh,

720
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,873
they introduced,

721
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:39,720
you know,

722
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,480
hey,

723
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,700
this is Joe Joe,

724
00:19:41,701 --> 00:19:42,750
this is whatever her name was.

725
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,220
And I go,

726
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:44,470
oh,

727
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:44,640
hi.

728
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:44,881
I go,

729
00:19:44,881 --> 00:19:45,091
hi.

730
00:19:45,091 --> 00:19:45,750
Nice to meet Ya.

731
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,610
She was high and I go,

732
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:48,503
come here for a second.

733
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:50,280
I go fucking crazy.

734
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:50,791
I go,

735
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:51,624
what are you doing?

736
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:51,901
He goes,

737
00:19:51,901 --> 00:19:52,531
what are you talking about?

738
00:19:52,531 --> 00:19:52,741
I go,

739
00:19:52,741 --> 00:19:53,071
dude,

740
00:19:53,071 --> 00:19:55,230
that girl is fucking crazy.

741
00:19:55,231 --> 00:19:55,531
I go,

742
00:19:55,531 --> 00:19:56,364
trust me,

743
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:56,790
you gotta,

744
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,330
get the fuck out fast.

745
00:19:58,331 --> 00:19:59,670
You knew fast.

746
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,760
I locked eyes with her and
it wasn't a nervousness.

747
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,210
People get nervous if they see people
that have been on television sometimes.

748
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:06,720
Yeah,

749
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,130
but that goes away pretty quick.

750
00:20:08,131 --> 00:20:09,140
Once you start talking,

751
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:10,950
usually they're weirded out,

752
00:20:10,951 --> 00:20:12,750
but you can see what the weirded out was.

753
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,510
This was like black.

754
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,970
This was a like,

755
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,170
like a crazy person just like.

756
00:20:19,171 --> 00:20:19,591
I was like,

757
00:20:19,591 --> 00:20:20,210
what are you doing?

758
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:20,920
Callen?

759
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,020
Like she wasn't bad looking.

760
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,400
She's very attractive young lady,

761
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:28,820
but unfortunately there was something
wrong with her mind and years later Brian

762
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:35,150
was going into a bar and he ran into
her and she was a streetwalker wow.

763
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:38,490
Couple of years later,

764
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:38,821
yeah,

765
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:43,440
it turned out she was cranked
out on math and while he was,

766
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:44,510
you know,

767
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,150
mildly sweater,

768
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:48,340
she's doing meth and it them
awhile to figure it out,

769
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,380
like exactly what the
fuck was wrong with her.

770
00:20:50,381 --> 00:20:51,490
And he tried to fix her.

771
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:52,211
Oh really?

772
00:20:52,211 --> 00:20:54,070
He was doing that and
then he gave up on that.

773
00:20:54,071 --> 00:20:58,370
And then he runs into her and he's going
to a bar and she's a streetwalker move.

774
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,720
He probably cut out the part
where he slept with her again.

775
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,053
This one

776
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:09,010
he did one last time recently.

777
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:09,853
These scabs.

778
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,920
When's your last checkup?

779
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,150
I don't want to use a condom or not you.

780
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,580
You're special to me.

781
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,480
You always use condoms?

782
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:19,060
Don't know.

783
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:19,893
A lot of me.

784
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:23,661
Yeah,

785
00:21:23,661 --> 00:21:25,400
she's a hooker but she always use condoms.

786
00:21:25,401 --> 00:21:26,234
Don't worry about.

787
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:26,961
It's good girl,

788
00:21:26,961 --> 00:21:27,490
man.

789
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:28,000
Yeah.

790
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,480
He said it was really super depressing,

791
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:29,931
but it was.

792
00:21:29,931 --> 00:21:30,830
I smelled her.

793
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:31,940
I don't know what to describe it.

794
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,340
I mean it would suck if I was wrong.

795
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:34,700
She was like the nicest person ever.

796
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:35,960
But I wasn't wrong.

797
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:36,290
James.

798
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:37,001
Exactly what it was.

799
00:21:37,001 --> 00:21:37,780
Warning him about.

800
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,840
Ranger has a smell.

801
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:39,763
You're dangerous.

802
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:40,740
It's assumption.

803
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:41,723
Don't know what

804
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:46,290
the fuck.

805
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:47,163
Cock sucker.

806
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,940
Bert Kreischer and Joey Diaz,

807
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:49,803
lazy gentleman.

808
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,030
They are actually doing it.

809
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:51,671
Podcast,

810
00:21:51,671 --> 00:21:55,380
a live podcast which is
the perfect spot for it.

811
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:57,120
Right next door at the ice house.

812
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,910
And they're doing that at a 8:30.

813
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,400
And is that going to be on
Ustream or anything like that?

814
00:22:02,401 --> 00:22:03,600
Or just on itunes?

815
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:05,710
Just on itunes.

816
00:22:05,711 --> 00:22:06,111
Spiritually.

817
00:22:06,111 --> 00:22:06,690
You smell that.

818
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:08,280
You don't have to see it smells crazy.

819
00:22:08,281 --> 00:22:10,680
Bird bird that you uh,

820
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,070
what's it?

821
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,960
Victoria's secret's perfume
that all the strippers were.

822
00:22:12,961 --> 00:22:13,441
That's what I think.

823
00:22:13,441 --> 00:22:14,274
Crazy.

824
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:14,940
Happy.

825
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,620
Yeah.

826
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,470
Doesn't wear Kimonos.

827
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,343
What you trying to sign?

828
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,520
I saw a friend of mine's
tweet the other day like,

829
00:22:20,521 --> 00:22:20,700
oh,

830
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,200
I gotta go shopping for Cologne.

831
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:22,680
Look.

832
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,160
And I'm like,

833
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,641
oh no,

834
00:22:23,641 --> 00:22:24,474
you don't.

835
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:27,240
You don't ever watch out
for puppies on the floor.

836
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,693
Powerful.

837
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,470
Those porn stars.

838
00:22:33,471 --> 00:22:35,080
She just bind about their dogs

839
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:38,683
or

840
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:44,190
powerful Joe George Saint Pierre
podcast was fucking awesome.

841
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:44,491
Yeah,

842
00:22:44,491 --> 00:22:45,001
it was cool.

843
00:22:45,001 --> 00:22:46,950
I wish he could have
stayed longer than an hour.

844
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,030
That's a long time for most people.

845
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,110
But he was super cool to talk to him.

846
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,410
Did he?

847
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:55,410
So what's the wrap?

848
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,573
Does he,

849
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,700
does he really think he
got abducted by aliens?

850
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,040
He really thinks he
got a Dr Balian series.

851
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:02,730
He,

852
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:03,120
um,

853
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,050
he thinks that it's possible that
ever since he was a little boy,

854
00:23:07,051 --> 00:23:08,330
like he's been missing time.

855
00:23:08,331 --> 00:23:09,540
He misses time sometimes.

856
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,630
Can he thinks it's possible if they
take him and he didn't want to let talk

857
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,553
about

858
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,040
fucking Nick Diaz and
to get ahold of that.

859
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:18,981
Well,

860
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:19,240
you know,

861
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:19,830
one man,

862
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,270
he fights like a fucking alien.

863
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,120
Joe.

864
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,380
Did you read what it could be like
there's somebody on your message board put

865
00:23:27,381 --> 00:23:27,590
like,

866
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,060
Oh,

867
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:32,960
wikipedia page where it said it could
be like five or six different things and

868
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:33,500
you know,

869
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,460
one thing and there's actually,

870
00:23:34,461 --> 00:23:36,080
when we were talking about
driving on the highway,

871
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:40,040
that's actually a condition like highway
hypnotism where you just get hypnotized

872
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:40,770
by the highway.

873
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:41,810
But like the constant,

874
00:23:41,811 --> 00:23:43,760
like a motion that's.

875
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,100
And then it also

876
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:46,490
said that,

877
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:46,670
you know,

878
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:47,690
some people say it's aliens,

879
00:23:47,691 --> 00:23:49,460
but I think you should
just do the gopro thing.

880
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:50,840
Yeah,

881
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,010
just record yourself.

882
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:57,230
I tell you what I saw in my boss
was not what was under this Gopro.

883
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:01,820
Tell you I saw a Ufo man.

884
00:24:01,821 --> 00:24:03,380
I'm not fucking lying.

885
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,240
Ufo.

886
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:06,890
Calm down man.

887
00:24:06,891 --> 00:24:11,780
And take me to another
planet fucking lying to you.

888
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:12,981
That's my best.

889
00:24:12,981 --> 00:24:16,370
George St Pierre was pretty
good at first when he says,

890
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:16,760
are you like,

891
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,593
that's cool man.

892
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:19,530
I don't know what the
fuck's going on with him.

893
00:24:19,531 --> 00:24:19,680
Yeah,

894
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,361
that might be true.

895
00:24:20,361 --> 00:24:21,380
Imagine if it was true when I was.

896
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,050
You got to deal with him and the aliens.

897
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,221
Good point,

898
00:24:26,221 --> 00:24:26,521
man,

899
00:24:26,521 --> 00:24:27,720
and at some point I've heard before,

900
00:24:27,721 --> 00:24:28,920
but it's still a really good point.

901
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:29,551
He's like,

902
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:32,980
imagine if you were a fish
and you are in the ocean.

903
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,600
That was great.

904
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,600
You are living your life and all of a
sudden a man come in with a hook and pull

905
00:24:38,761 --> 00:24:42,650
you out of the water and you come
back to tell your friend like,

906
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,410
look,

907
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:44,243
I saw you

908
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:46,960
Scott.

909
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,770
If you'd like to get the fuck out of here,

910
00:24:48,771 --> 00:24:49,604
you're crazy.

911
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,420
That was a really good point.

912
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,370
I was on the plane laughing hysterically.

913
00:24:55,371 --> 00:24:55,790
Yeah.

914
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:56,720
It's a very good point.

915
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:57,740
It's a very good point.

916
00:24:57,741 --> 00:24:58,061
Yeah,

917
00:24:58,061 --> 00:24:59,450
it is because look,

918
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,320
we.

919
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,290
The fact that we exist at all is insane.

920
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,910
People with cell phones driving around
in their cars talking to another dude.

921
00:25:07,911 --> 00:25:09,320
I do that on all the time in my car.

922
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,580
I was talking to my friend Tommy.

923
00:25:10,581 --> 00:25:11,660
He lives in Connecticut.

924
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:17,270
We're talking while I'm driving around
and in real time and just just taking it

925
00:25:17,271 --> 00:25:17,860
for granted.

926
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,310
It's just completely taken it for granted.

927
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:20,540
We're crazy amazing.

928
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:25,080
Pulling fish out of the ocean with giant
nets and shit just and throwing all

929
00:25:25,081 --> 00:25:26,790
this shit water in their kit.

930
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,501
Daddy here.

931
00:25:27,501 --> 00:25:29,180
Just dumping all our pollutants.

932
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:31,340
We don't give a fuck.

933
00:25:31,341 --> 00:25:32,360
We're gangster with.

934
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:33,470
There's water near us.

935
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,540
It's no good water in New York.

936
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:36,770
There's no good water.

937
00:25:36,771 --> 00:25:38,030
You can't drink any of that.

938
00:25:38,031 --> 00:25:39,650
You can't grow fish in any of that.

939
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,240
All that water's polluted with like,

940
00:25:41,241 --> 00:25:41,511
yeah,

941
00:25:41,511 --> 00:25:42,860
you know it's the Hudson

942
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,020
the way it is.

943
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:45,761
Just the way it is.

944
00:25:45,761 --> 00:25:45,960
Yeah.

945
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,280
Fucking animals.

946
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:52,400
Just throwing glass and shit
and Piss and tampons and rubbers

947
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:54,450
and bodies.

948
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,640
Bodies like fuck.

949
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:57,390
Fucking dead.

950
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:57,590
God.

951
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,423
God.

952
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:01,300
People from New York come up
with a Jersey cylon Sundays.

953
00:26:01,301 --> 00:26:02,320
It's like a big day for them.

954
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:06,210
Like we'll going into Jersey on fucking
Sunday and they go over and they fished

955
00:26:06,211 --> 00:26:07,200
and they catch eel.

956
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:08,043
No grill up.

957
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:09,070
What the fuck?

958
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,330
It's just an email that got me on.

959
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:10,870
It.

960
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:12,500
Just made on the yield
from the fucking Hudson.

961
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:14,530
That's why I ain't scared of not cancer.

962
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:15,490
They can suck my dick.

963
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:16,743
The yield from the

964
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,033
I'm in.

965
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:24,130
We were in Jersey one time and me and
joe on a bus headed to a UFC event and I

966
00:26:24,161 --> 00:26:27,070
showed him this pond and I said,

967
00:26:27,071 --> 00:26:27,910
look at cancer.

968
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:29,440
It was late cancer.

969
00:26:29,441 --> 00:26:30,274
It was cancer.

970
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:33,010
Like this pond had a
move that no movement.

971
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:35,830
It had like a layer of this green algae,

972
00:26:35,831 --> 00:26:36,940
which really wasn't green.

973
00:26:36,941 --> 00:26:38,340
That's just cancer bro.

974
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:39,703
They,

975
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,030
you know,

976
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:40,863
New Jersey.

977
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:43,330
They've been dumping
shit since the seventies,

978
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:44,840
since the sixties,

979
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:45,230
Bro.

980
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,710
But that's never going to be.

981
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,753
That's what's what's.

982
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:48,820
What's that word?

983
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,860
Record low record.

984
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,310
Mobile,

985
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:51,060
reconcilable.

986
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,670
Know the other word when
you can't reverse directly,

987
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:58,260
you can never reverse that soil and

988
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,320
that soil in New Jersey,

989
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,990
when they built the metal lands,

990
00:27:06,991 --> 00:27:10,770
I remember how many animals
all of a sudden I had in
my living room because they

991
00:27:10,771 --> 00:27:14,100
tore all that down that wildlife
and next year and I was seeing.

992
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:18,180
I remember one night seen a
possum the size of a small people

993
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:22,200
treat fucking tree.

994
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,070
You saw me

995
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:27,510
walk like a fucking ate those things.

996
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,140
When you,

997
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,520
when you call the police in Jersey,

998
00:27:29,521 --> 00:27:30,510
I've got a possum here.

999
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,830
They shoot the fucking thing.

1000
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,510
They shoot the fucking thing.

1001
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,120
You don't shoot snakes or the naughty.

1002
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,660
They shoot the fucking possible because
they play dead and then when the cops

1003
00:27:39,661 --> 00:27:41,580
leave they fucking get
up and they brushed me.

1004
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:46,580
You can run over a fucking car with
bicycles and throw names out of brush

1005
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,140
themselves off this

1006
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:50,970
behavioral trait.

1007
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:54,600
They play Dave fucking planes
that were playing possum.

1008
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:54,901
Oh,

1009
00:27:54,901 --> 00:27:58,620
I seen a fucking possum that looked at
me one night at like four in the morning.

1010
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,761
I looked at him.

1011
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:00,211
I was like,

1012
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:01,590
what the fuck?

1013
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:07,000
And he jumped on a treatment
it like he held onto the tree

1014
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:10,831
and I was like,

1015
00:28:10,831 --> 00:28:12,690
this is fucking mind boggling.

1016
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:16,620
I saw skunks that look
like fucking like monsters.

1017
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:18,280
You know that.

1018
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,550
What do you think those didn't they just.

1019
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:23,130
We had this discussion on your
show a year and a half ago,

1020
00:28:23,131 --> 00:28:27,300
but in the bronx they found
a rat that was just amazing.

1021
00:28:27,301 --> 00:28:28,470
Like it broke all records.

1022
00:28:28,471 --> 00:28:31,410
The length of it is a type,

1023
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,120
I think it's called the Zambian.

1024
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,660
Are you being something wrapped?

1025
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:35,880
So I'm from America.

1026
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:36,600
It's a pet.

1027
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:36,821
Oh,

1028
00:28:36,821 --> 00:28:37,610
how about.

1029
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:40,050
And they've let so many people
have let these things go.

1030
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,660
And like how Florida
has the python problem,

1031
00:28:42,661 --> 00:28:44,070
they have this rat problem.

1032
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,600
It's an invasive species.

1033
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:46,920
We let go of one of those.

1034
00:28:46,921 --> 00:28:49,110
Pythons in college were part of that.

1035
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:50,840
Laura,

1036
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,750
you went to school in Florida.

1037
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:57,030
Scariest fucking day of my life were
moving out of that apartment and I'm,

1038
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:57,331
am I,

1039
00:28:57,331 --> 00:28:57,690
you know,

1040
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:00,180
how you move out and you've got clothes
everywhere and I'm just digging my hands

1041
00:29:00,181 --> 00:29:01,260
into my buddy comes in the room.

1042
00:29:01,261 --> 00:29:01,470
He was,

1043
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:01,950
oh,

1044
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:06,950
keep a lookout for my python and know
what we lost it at the middle of the year.

1045
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:07,680
Like,

1046
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,860
and it's just in our house and as well.

1047
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:11,771
Wait a minute,

1048
00:29:11,771 --> 00:29:12,151
wait a minute.

1049
00:29:12,151 --> 00:29:12,330
Wait,

1050
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:12,571
but wait,

1051
00:29:12,571 --> 00:29:13,780
what do you mean we lost it?

1052
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:14,600
We.

1053
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:14,871
Okay.

1054
00:29:14,871 --> 00:29:16,760
We got broken into by,

1055
00:29:16,761 --> 00:29:17,060
uh,

1056
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,590
by these dudes and we had dogs.

1057
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:19,640
Me and my buddy hardly had dogs.

1058
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,690
Body cheese had a python.

1059
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:22,340
He put both his dog.

1060
00:29:22,341 --> 00:29:24,030
She's got,

1061
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,330
she's to fucking torture this dude.

1062
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,420
Fucking green stuff is bay breaks
and went mountain biking one time.

1063
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,750
Holy fucking.

1064
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,090
But we forgot about it.

1065
00:29:32,091 --> 00:29:35,090
We briefed his brakes on but he didn't
go and then two weeks later we go and we

1066
00:29:35,091 --> 00:29:35,361
forgot.

1067
00:29:35,361 --> 00:29:36,194
We increased them.

1068
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,530
He just like,

1069
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:38,403
what the fuck?

1070
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:39,591
So yeah,

1071
00:29:39,591 --> 00:29:44,020
these guys broke into her house and our
dogs in our rooms and then they broke in

1072
00:29:44,021 --> 00:29:47,020
the house and they let the fucking
snake out fucking broke into the house.

1073
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:47,913
Stole all her shit.

1074
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:48,850
Let her show you.

1075
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:50,380
Not totally responsible for it.

1076
00:29:50,381 --> 00:29:51,640
Somebody else let the snake out.

1077
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:51,940
Yeah.

1078
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:52,773
I don't know.

1079
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,190
Did you ever Diaz as.

1080
00:29:54,191 --> 00:29:55,180
Did you ever see a banana?

1081
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:55,650
Right?

1082
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:56,021
How do you know?

1083
00:29:56,021 --> 00:29:57,160
They didn't just steal a snake.

1084
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,460
A [inaudible] [inaudible].

1085
00:29:58,530 --> 00:29:59,140
She was like,

1086
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,550
I don't know if it's been in there or not.

1087
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:01,780
The fucking lid was open.

1088
00:30:01,781 --> 00:30:02,321
They looked for it.

1089
00:30:02,321 --> 00:30:03,010
That I don't know.

1090
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,860
It probably in the last assholes
are allowed to buy snakes.

1091
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:07,160
Any asshole like this anywhere.

1092
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:10,420
Responsible Savannah monitors.

1093
00:30:10,421 --> 00:30:11,470
I was into reptiles.

1094
00:30:11,471 --> 00:30:12,300
Big Ticket.

1095
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:15,400
You got a pit bull and I think that
they should give you by a pit bull.

1096
00:30:15,401 --> 00:30:16,600
You need to take a ged.

1097
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:20,470
That's a particular shift with
they when they should definitely,

1098
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:26,870
definitely make you answer questions
and they're dangerous animals.

1099
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:29,440
I'll go a step further and saddle
think single women in their 30,

1100
00:30:29,441 --> 00:30:30,730
she'd be allowed to adopt dogs.

1101
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:31,660
Why do you say that?

1102
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,910
Because they have fucked
up their life now.

1103
00:30:33,911 --> 00:30:35,410
Let's stop it there.

1104
00:30:35,411 --> 00:30:38,170
Let's cut it off there
and not let them to.

1105
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,453
Have you ever seen up.

1106
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:39,760
Look,

1107
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,061
this is.

1108
00:30:40,061 --> 00:30:41,540
I'm taking a stretch and
I know what I'm saying.

1109
00:30:41,541 --> 00:30:42,730
So I'm seeing a woman in the thirties,

1110
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:44,021
mid thirties,

1111
00:30:44,021 --> 00:30:44,960
like 35 when the.

1112
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:45,461
When they go,

1113
00:30:45,461 --> 00:30:46,294
that's it.

1114
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:48,010
I'm comfortable with being single.

1115
00:30:48,011 --> 00:30:51,460
Now I'm going to get a rescue dog and
then you go hiking and that dog goes after

1116
00:30:51,461 --> 00:30:52,760
your kids because they don't.

1117
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,310
Are you sure that they're
really comfortable with being
single and it's probably

1118
00:30:57,311 --> 00:30:58,810
hard to find a good dude man.

1119
00:30:59,080 --> 00:30:59,310
Yeah,

1120
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:02,970
but you never had those women that
get the big dogs and they're like,

1121
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,270
it's a rescue dog.

1122
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:05,500
This is my new project.

1123
00:31:05,501 --> 00:31:06,550
They want some love.

1124
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:06,890
Yeah.

1125
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:07,930
And exactly.

1126
00:31:07,931 --> 00:31:11,290
And then they don't fucking discipline
it and they just let it go from fucking

1127
00:31:11,291 --> 00:31:12,124
bananas,

1128
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:13,780
psycho fucking dog.

1129
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:14,540
The

1130
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:18,620
dogs get really protective of their
owners and if they sense that their owner

1131
00:31:18,621 --> 00:31:19,640
might not be like,

1132
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:20,550
you know,

1133
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,383
very dominant.

1134
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:21,740
Yeah.

1135
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,580
If it's maybe it doesn't have deep voice,

1136
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,260
something like that.

1137
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:27,050
The dog might be extra protective.

1138
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:28,520
Was your pit bull dangerous?

1139
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,150
Yeah.

1140
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:29,740
Yeah.

1141
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:30,130
Yeah.

1142
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:35,130
I had a pit bull encounters or one
dog killed one of my other dogs.

1143
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:36,320
Why?

1144
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,000
I came home in the
middle of my living room,

1145
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,980
one of my females that
killed my other female.

1146
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,000
Oh my God.

1147
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:41,511
Yeah.

1148
00:31:41,511 --> 00:31:43,280
You can have two female dogs together.

1149
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:47,340
Female dogs apparently will
always fight over dominance.

1150
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:49,910
Whereas a male and a female,

1151
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,310
they accept like who's who's the boss?

1152
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,720
Usually the male just lets the female,

1153
00:31:54,721 --> 00:31:55,280
like fap,

1154
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,210
she's leave me alone.

1155
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:57,800
Like female staffers,

1156
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,630
jaws in the mail like sort of gives up.

1157
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:02,930
But the females never give up.

1158
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,490
They never give up the position.

1159
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:05,990
They'll fight to the death.

1160
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:10,040
They fight and then they give up and
they figure out like who wins and who

1161
00:32:10,041 --> 00:32:10,640
loses.

1162
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,473
But then the challenge,

1163
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:12,381
the one who lost,

1164
00:32:12,381 --> 00:32:16,270
wants to go back out again and they did
it a couple of times and I thought I'd

1165
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:17,450
gotten them over it.

1166
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:18,590
I separated,

1167
00:32:18,591 --> 00:32:18,891
um,

1168
00:32:18,891 --> 00:32:21,260
and I did all sorts of different things
and then I started letting them be

1169
00:32:21,261 --> 00:32:24,680
together again because I thought they
would had gotten over it because I felt

1170
00:32:24,681 --> 00:32:27,560
like maybe it was just
some like animosity,

1171
00:32:27,561 --> 00:32:29,210
like it was too fresh
on each other's mind.

1172
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,320
They had gotten into a fight,

1173
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,800
but it's so normal for that
breed to get into fights,

1174
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:34,371
you know,

1175
00:32:34,371 --> 00:32:36,260
they're beautiful dogs with humans.

1176
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:37,700
They're beautiful dogs with humans.

1177
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:39,800
But with people with rather,

1178
00:32:39,801 --> 00:32:42,080
they have just this
incredible killed drive.

1179
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,700
It's like nothing I've ever seen.

1180
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:45,350
My dog killed two cats.

1181
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:45,980
Um,

1182
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,630
he killed squirrels.

1183
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:52,750
He killed anything dumb enough to get in
his yard and he would kill lizards all

1184
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:53,300
day.

1185
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,130
Like we had these lizards
that would run around and he,

1186
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:56,480
that was his video game.

1187
00:32:56,481 --> 00:32:58,850
He would just run around
with his paws on the wall,

1188
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:02,060
trying to get these lizards just running
around the perimeter of my house trying

1189
00:33:02,061 --> 00:33:02,894
to get lizards.

1190
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:03,651
In hindsight,

1191
00:33:03,651 --> 00:33:04,550
I look back and I'm like,

1192
00:33:04,551 --> 00:33:05,870
what a crazy animal to have.

1193
00:33:05,871 --> 00:33:06,800
You've got a monster.

1194
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:07,920
You got to monster.

1195
00:33:07,921 --> 00:33:09,110
It loves to attack things.

1196
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:09,441
He,

1197
00:33:09,441 --> 00:33:11,360
but he was a very particular type of dog.

1198
00:33:11,361 --> 00:33:11,670
He was,

1199
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:12,290
um,

1200
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:13,610
a hog dog.

1201
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:15,100
The origin from the Argentinian?

1202
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:15,530
No,

1203
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:15,740
no.

1204
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,573
He was a pit bull.

1205
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:17,660
Well,

1206
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,493
he was from Hawaii.

1207
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,420
It was from Hawaii and they're there.

1208
00:33:20,421 --> 00:33:24,590
They breed them to be super
animal aggressive because
they're breeding them for

1209
00:33:24,591 --> 00:33:26,390
hog hunting and so they all,

1210
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:30,050
they have longer ears and the ears pick
up more of a scent and they're larger

1211
00:33:30,051 --> 00:33:30,740
dogs.

1212
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,573
He was crazy.

1213
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,750
He was beautiful dog though.

1214
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:35,660
It was awesome with people with
people who the greatest thing ever.

1215
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:36,523
He was awesome.

1216
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,090
He was just amazing buddy.

1217
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,410
He was like super smart.

1218
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,840
He always wanted to hang with you.

1219
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:42,350
You always be down to wrestle.

1220
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:45,470
Like I never felt in danger
to do Jujitsu with him.

1221
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,490
I take us back,

1222
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,030
you know,

1223
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:49,090
I'd go tell him to put the
choker and they'd be like,

1224
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:51,560
he lady who to kiss me a buddha.

1225
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:52,760
Have you do like,

1226
00:33:52,761 --> 00:33:54,560
I would be like choking
him and he would kiss me.

1227
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:55,610
He was a sweet,

1228
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:56,391
sweet,

1229
00:33:56,391 --> 00:33:57,620
sweet dog with people,

1230
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:01,030
but with animals to another
who's not to be trusted,

1231
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:02,180
who was not to be trusted.

1232
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:03,230
It was the craziest thing.

1233
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:03,920
It didn't.

1234
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,200
I didn't have anything
to do with socializing.

1235
00:34:06,201 --> 00:34:09,470
I socialize them with other dogs like
right away he started fighting with other

1236
00:34:09,471 --> 00:34:09,810
dogs.

1237
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:10,191
What time?

1238
00:34:10,191 --> 00:34:10,851
He was a baby.

1239
00:34:10,851 --> 00:34:11,180
They got,

1240
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:11,630
they.

1241
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:14,290
People yelled at me at a
dog park when he was a baby.

1242
00:34:14,291 --> 00:34:15,350
It was like four months old.

1243
00:34:15,351 --> 00:34:17,000
He was trying to bite other dogs.

1244
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:22,490
He was just gangster like from the womb
and I was a fool to try to control this

1245
00:34:22,491 --> 00:34:23,510
animal is in pet,

1246
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:24,071
you know,

1247
00:34:24,071 --> 00:34:25,100
like my dog now.

1248
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:25,761
The big one,

1249
00:34:25,761 --> 00:34:26,390
Johnny.

1250
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:28,580
He's the sweetest dog ever.

1251
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,990
He's a sweetie.

1252
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:31,310
Like my other dog.

1253
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,400
That's a much smaller
dog that she believed.

1254
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:34,310
New bulldog mix.

1255
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:35,960
That dog tells him what's up.

1256
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:36,861
And Johnny goes,

1257
00:34:36,861 --> 00:34:37,201
all right,

1258
00:34:37,201 --> 00:34:37,581
all right.

1259
00:34:37,581 --> 00:34:38,840
He's just like relaxed.

1260
00:34:38,841 --> 00:34:39,231
We lag.

1261
00:34:39,231 --> 00:34:40,640
Just lets it all go by.

1262
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:41,743
You know.

1263
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:42,650
So you think it's it?

1264
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:43,371
They're born with it though,

1265
00:34:43,371 --> 00:34:45,400
is just like people how
their bread is buttered.

1266
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:45,740
Bread.

1267
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:45,921
Yeah.

1268
00:34:45,921 --> 00:34:48,500
They encourage a certain
type of animal aggression,

1269
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,850
aggression towards animals.

1270
00:34:49,851 --> 00:34:50,510
They encourage it.

1271
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:54,050
They encouraged fighting and it's been
that way for thousands of years and it's

1272
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:59,380
the cruel aspect of the dog fighting
though is what makes amazing dogs because

1273
00:35:00,201 --> 00:35:02,750
the ones that survived
through that horrible ordeal,

1274
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:07,580
that genetics that were passed on because
the dog that quit and the dogs that

1275
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:11,120
are cowed and backed away
from a fight were killed.

1276
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,290
They were all killed.

1277
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,140
That sounds horrible to us
because we love our dogs.

1278
00:35:15,141 --> 00:35:15,680
Sure.

1279
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,350
But they weren't looking
at dogs like that.

1280
00:35:18,351 --> 00:35:21,230
They were looking at dogs as a way to
make money and the way to make money.

1281
00:35:21,231 --> 00:35:21,530
I mean,

1282
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:26,510
you're talking about like this probably
went on from maybe the turn of the

1283
00:35:26,511 --> 00:35:27,200
century on.

1284
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,600
I mean it's probably something that's
been going on even before that.

1285
00:35:29,601 --> 00:35:31,520
If you could really get
into the history of it,

1286
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:32,510
but they.

1287
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:34,940
They bred dogs specifically for fighting.

1288
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,980
They bred them specifically for that.

1289
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:38,100
Had them on chains.

1290
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:38,970
They would put them.

1291
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:42,450
There's a dude that I know that was a
famous pool player used to keep 35 pit

1292
00:35:42,451 --> 00:35:43,180
bulls.

1293
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,490
It was this pro pool player,

1294
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:46,050
35 pit bulls at his house.

1295
00:35:46,051 --> 00:35:46,980
They weren't as pets.

1296
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,420
They were fighting dogs.

1297
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:49,680
Crazy man.

1298
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:50,041
There's.

1299
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:50,610
Yeah,

1300
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:51,241
craziness,

1301
00:35:51,241 --> 00:35:51,540
man.

1302
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,030
I think big boi from
outkast used to do that too.

1303
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:54,220
Well,

1304
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,710
that's a big part of the culture.

1305
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,410
He bred those dogs and he read the,

1306
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:58,970
the,

1307
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:01,170
the bully ones that are stocky.

1308
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:01,810
He,

1309
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:04,250
he never went to his
website and looked at him.

1310
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:05,103
They're expensive.

1311
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:05,970
You know,

1312
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:06,810
big boys website.

1313
00:36:06,811 --> 00:36:07,070
Well,

1314
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:07,350
yeah.

1315
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:09,410
Well it's purple ribbon in the,

1316
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,860
in the world of fighting dogs.

1317
00:36:10,861 --> 00:36:12,990
This is where it gets really squirrely
because it's not like I'm trying to

1318
00:36:12,991 --> 00:36:14,160
glorify this world,

1319
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:14,650
um,

1320
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:15,320
and get,

1321
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,010
give it morals or anything like that.

1322
00:36:17,011 --> 00:36:19,170
But the reality is in
the fighting dog world,

1323
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,300
you're not supposed to sell the puppies.

1324
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:24,090
They're called puppy peddlers
and they're looked down upon.

1325
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,720
You're only supposed to
let your dog breed with,

1326
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,500
with really respectable breed.

1327
00:36:28,501 --> 00:36:32,220
So you're going to make some crazy killer
dog and men will loan out their dog

1328
00:36:32,221 --> 00:36:35,700
and like you see like the lineage
written down like you know,

1329
00:36:35,701 --> 00:36:36,750
rough riders,

1330
00:36:36,751 --> 00:36:40,440
Bronco and subtle stables,

1331
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,720
Sheila e dot,

1332
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:42,151
you know,

1333
00:36:42,151 --> 00:36:43,710
and that's the dog's precedent.

1334
00:36:43,711 --> 00:36:46,240
And they all know the
championship bloodlines.

1335
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,870
That's totally illegal
to have dog fighting.

1336
00:36:48,871 --> 00:36:51,150
But the shit has been documented.

1337
00:36:51,151 --> 00:36:52,650
It's like very thoroughly.

1338
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,450
It's the same thing with chicken fighting.

1339
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,640
Like they have champion chickens.

1340
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,940
Like I know a dude who raises
chickens and he fights them,

1341
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:00,690
you know,

1342
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:01,830
there's this old Mexican dude,

1343
00:37:01,831 --> 00:37:02,790
he's cool as fuck,

1344
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,391
you know,

1345
00:37:03,391 --> 00:37:03,750
and,

1346
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:05,370
but that's his culture man.

1347
00:37:05,371 --> 00:37:10,320
He grew up fighting chickens and this guy
knows like championship bloodlines and

1348
00:37:10,321 --> 00:37:12,930
they breed the right chickens
with the right hands.

1349
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,890
Like it's been a part of
human history forever,

1350
00:37:16,891 --> 00:37:17,640
but it's,

1351
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,310
it's like in the shadows
and the darkness of our,

1352
00:37:20,311 --> 00:37:21,121
of our world.

1353
00:37:21,121 --> 00:37:23,540
And we don't want to admit that in 2000,

1354
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:24,151
whatever it was,

1355
00:37:24,151 --> 00:37:25,200
nine or whenever,

1356
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:25,440
when,

1357
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,273
when,

1358
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:27,890
when he got busted me.

1359
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:28,140
What,

1360
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:28,380
when,

1361
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,190
what year was that?

1362
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:29,791
Two thousand nine.

1363
00:37:29,791 --> 00:37:30,960
Maybe eight or nine.

1364
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:32,200
Maybe.

1365
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,230
It was some time in jail.

1366
00:37:34,231 --> 00:37:34,560
Yeah.

1367
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:39,150
We never want to think that a guy who's
capable of such great heights is being

1368
00:37:39,151 --> 00:37:43,950
like this massively successful football
player could also be capable of such an

1369
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:44,873
insane crew.

1370
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:45,830
So insane.

1371
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:46,431
I got to tell you,

1372
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:47,660
I love dogs.

1373
00:37:47,661 --> 00:37:48,020
Like,

1374
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:48,201
I mean,

1375
00:37:48,201 --> 00:37:48,650
you know,

1376
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:53,060
you guys all did me a huge salad doing
the fundraiser for the dog last week and

1377
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:54,200
I love dogs,

1378
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:55,880
but I still,

1379
00:37:55,881 --> 00:38:00,020
I also have a problem with people
who don't let somebody like him.

1380
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,190
I'm like,

1381
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:06,540
serve his time and then get another shot
at like earning a living again because

1382
00:38:06,831 --> 00:38:07,551
a lot of people were suit,

1383
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:10,010
like rightfully recruited
critical of what he did.

1384
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:11,030
Right.

1385
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:12,140
But you know,

1386
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,250
he lost his name.

1387
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:17,270
He lost hundreds of millions
of dollars probably.

1388
00:38:17,271 --> 00:38:18,104
Right?

1389
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,063
Absolutely.

1390
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:23,180
His contract was like about the biggest
at the time he had crazy endorsements.

1391
00:38:23,181 --> 00:38:24,320
He went to prison,

1392
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:26,630
which is what the punishment was.

1393
00:38:26,631 --> 00:38:27,140
He did it.

1394
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:30,500
He went to prison and he did his time and
then a lot of people were really upset

1395
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,870
that he even has a
chance to make a living.

1396
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:33,081
Right.

1397
00:38:33,081 --> 00:38:33,810
But it's like he,

1398
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:34,390
we,

1399
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:34,730
he,

1400
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:36,310
he paid the price,

1401
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:36,590
right?

1402
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:38,440
One denial is his fucking talent.

1403
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:39,521
The NFL is like,

1404
00:38:39,521 --> 00:38:39,970
you know what,

1405
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:40,810
come on back.

1406
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:41,440
Come on back.

1407
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,070
You know why?

1408
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,000
Because if they don't do it,

1409
00:38:43,001 --> 00:38:43,960
someone else going to do it.

1410
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:44,320
Yeah.

1411
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:44,590
Some,

1412
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:44,980
some.

1413
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,210
Someone's going to grab that guy.

1414
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:46,700
No,

1415
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,220
it really wouldn't be any
other way to play football.

1416
00:38:49,221 --> 00:38:50,750
I mean that's kind of A.

1417
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,270
I mean there's the nfl
and there's basically.

1418
00:38:52,271 --> 00:38:52,720
That's it.

1419
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,171
That's it.

1420
00:38:53,171 --> 00:38:53,551
That's the,

1421
00:38:53,551 --> 00:38:54,280
there's the,

1422
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,820
the b league is not really
a League for football.

1423
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,393
The idea that

1424
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,750
Rina.

1425
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:02,250
Rina.

1426
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:03,083
Yeah.

1427
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:05,640
I played that for for a day.

1428
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:06,813
I

1429
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,920
don't know if they drug test.

1430
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,310
It's just fucking brutal.

1431
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,000
It's brutal.

1432
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,230
It's like being in the yard.

1433
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,700
Canadian football has some good.

1434
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:15,960
Had some good athletes for sure.

1435
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:16,780
Good players,

1436
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:20,590
but NFL is definitely the top of
mine and he was a bad motherfucker.

1437
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,990
Doug flutie Canada

1438
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:24,630
first and play up there for awhile
before he came down to America.

1439
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,980
He was the hero when I was in highschool.

1440
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,170
Doug flutie was like,

1441
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:30,260
I think I was in high school
and he was in college.

1442
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,420
It was the hero.

1443
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,140
It's right.

1444
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:37,290
And then there was the USFL
was very famous in Boston.

1445
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:38,131
He was right.

1446
00:39:38,131 --> 00:39:38,570
Yeah.

1447
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:39,690
He was super famous.

1448
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:40,900
Have you seen the 30 for 30?

1449
00:39:40,901 --> 00:39:41,980
Who Killed The USFL?

1450
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:42,940
Yes.

1451
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:43,870
Fucking great.

1452
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,970
Donald trump ruined that Shaylee.

1453
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:46,750
Yeah,

1454
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:47,740
he just ruined it.

1455
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:48,721
He did it.

1456
00:39:48,721 --> 00:39:49,361
That's all.

1457
00:39:49,361 --> 00:39:50,140
Those are amazing.

1458
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,580
That's the best programming.

1459
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:56,370
ESPN or basically any
30 for 30 documentary.

1460
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:59,320
What are the stories that
will fucking kill you?

1461
00:39:59,640 --> 00:39:59,940
They.

1462
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:00,670
It started.

1463
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:03,610
The concept came up last year
was the 30th anniversary.

1464
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:04,990
Billy Corbin did the first one.

1465
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,230
That was about the.

1466
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:08,260
You had a podcast.

1467
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,213
That's up.

1468
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,700
Billy Corbin is the guy who did cocaine.

1469
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:14,940
Cowboys broke,

1470
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,110
broke,

1471
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:17,050
fucking broke,

1472
00:40:17,051 --> 00:40:17,930
which is amazing.

1473
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:18,761
Cool.

1474
00:40:18,761 --> 00:40:19,594
Fucking guy.

1475
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:23,010
The Fort Lauderdale Improv and hung out.

1476
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:23,410
Yeah,

1477
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:23,681
cooking.

1478
00:40:23,681 --> 00:40:24,820
You fucking.

1479
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:30,090
You have them on the EU when he
shows all the fucking Michael Irvin,

1480
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,860
those guys in front of
clubs and he goes to Miami.

1481
00:40:32,861 --> 00:40:36,100
Dolphins use to ask the college
guys to get them into the club.

1482
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:39,910
You watched the trailer
for the you of you.

1483
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:43,430
Why'd you go like thing was Florida state.

1484
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,940
We hated them and I fucking saw it.

1485
00:40:44,941 --> 00:40:49,941
It was like it was a bunch
of black gangsters with a
white coats that go out and

1486
00:40:49,981 --> 00:40:50,890
be black gangsters.

1487
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:51,773
Motherfucker,

1488
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:52,843
slow

1489
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,021
white guy.

1490
00:40:55,021 --> 00:40:57,230
Go the black of the better.

1491
00:40:58,740 --> 00:40:59,940
I want you to bring it back.

1492
00:40:59,941 --> 00:41:01,110
I want high fives.

1493
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:02,690
I want fucking chains.

1494
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,500
I want everything.

1495
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:06,720
I want you to not celebrate.

1496
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,593
I want everything.

1497
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:10,290
I want you to fucking
humiliate these motherfuckers.

1498
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,020
And then the guy from two live
crew came out with his own.

1499
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:18,260
He had a fucking VIP and they
will come out to hit my dick.

1500
00:41:18,271 --> 00:41:19,020
I'm on.

1501
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,980
And those bitches knew what
time it was and that's all.

1502
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:22,710
Listen,

1503
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:25,410
there's two things that drive
black people to different levels.

1504
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:27,270
That's when they hear two live crew.

1505
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:29,160
When they go to red lobster,

1506
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,310
black people lose their
minds at red lobster.

1507
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:33,180
Fuck Popeye's.

1508
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,690
On Tuesday you take,

1509
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,020
you go to Sacramento,

1510
00:41:36,021 --> 00:41:38,600
red lobster on Friday at about 4:30,

1511
00:41:38,601 --> 00:41:39,530
when they blow the whistle,

1512
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:41,603
blow the whistle.

1513
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:44,430
That assistance they
weighed 300 with the hills.

1514
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,600
What are you showing over there?

1515
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,070
That's the trailer for what?

1516
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:47,953
Yeah.

1517
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:48,420
Oh,

1518
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,430
that's that documentary is that.

1519
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:53,530
I don't know if that's all over the u.

1520
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:56,730
He did Bertha conquer with me.

1521
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:56,971
Well,

1522
00:41:56,971 --> 00:41:57,720
I got to remember this.

1523
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,351
Write this down.

1524
00:41:58,351 --> 00:41:58,471
Yeah.

1525
00:41:58,471 --> 00:42:00,600
That motherfucker was
given out blood test.

1526
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:03,330
He was coming up positive
and giving somebody else.

1527
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,250
This guy that was
smoking dope all the way.

1528
00:42:05,251 --> 00:42:06,150
The NFL warrants.

1529
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,800
Interesting that when you have like
football players and basketball players,

1530
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:14,100
they make rules on like how
they're allowed to celebrate.

1531
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:15,060
Yeah.

1532
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:18,360
Especially like the football thing
that's like you're not allowed to dance.

1533
00:42:18,361 --> 00:42:21,590
Hundred percent score a touchdown
100 percent because of black.

1534
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:21,871
Yeah.

1535
00:42:21,871 --> 00:42:22,410
And they're like,

1536
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:23,120
dude,

1537
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,660
if you blacked it up plenty.

1538
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:26,180
So let's dial it.

1539
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:27,170
It really is.

1540
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:28,340
This is a white man.

1541
00:42:28,341 --> 00:42:31,970
Probably didn't enjoy probably quite
old with a cigar with a white suit.

1542
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:32,250
Yeah.

1543
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:33,081
It's not a coincidence.

1544
00:42:33,081 --> 00:42:34,570
I love when people in the US to go,

1545
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:35,260
well,

1546
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:37,910
the greenish clockish child sudden listen,

1547
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:38,481
listen,

1548
00:42:38,481 --> 00:42:39,314
stupid.

1549
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:41,420
There was a guy named dexter the MOLESTA

1550
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:45,160
defensive back,

1551
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:48,840
the defensive back that used to
fucking group Krazy glue all over.

1552
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:49,320
So.

1553
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,350
Oh the

1554
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,193
other guy,

1555
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,890
he didn't stutter.

1556
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:03,720
People brought up with balls on his
shoulder because he was afraid of getting

1557
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,940
your ass dog be upon you.

1558
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:08,920
What your mother.

1559
00:43:08,921 --> 00:43:09,754
Hey Shit.

1560
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,810
There's a rule I got to touch.

1561
00:43:13,811 --> 00:43:15,550
You're five feet from
the line of scrimmage.

1562
00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:17,530
He was banging it right from the line.

1563
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:19,120
He come up on your spirit.

1564
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:20,680
What?

1565
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:21,250
What,

1566
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:21,810
what?

1567
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:22,480
What?

1568
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,460
What was his name to Lester Hayes?

1569
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:31,090
Defensive Bachelors and Ronnie Lott Total.

1570
00:43:31,091 --> 00:43:32,260
Joe Rogan about Ronnie Lott.

1571
00:43:32,261 --> 00:43:34,320
They told him he couldn't
play in the game phase.

1572
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:35,890
They cut his finger off during the game.

1573
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:36,431
They were like,

1574
00:43:36,431 --> 00:43:38,440
who the fuck gets his finger
cut off during the game?

1575
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:39,350
He had,

1576
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:41,390
he had caught his finger on a helmet.

1577
00:43:41,391 --> 00:43:42,620
He was like a cannon ball.

1578
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:47,890
Cannon Ball and just like total disregard
for body and like and like this is

1579
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:50,120
before good.

1580
00:43:50,121 --> 00:43:53,210
Hellman's and like he would
just annihilate people.

1581
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:57,620
He was the assassin and he got
his helmet caught in finger,

1582
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:58,970
his finger caught in a helmet,

1583
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:02,630
pinky and they went to the
locker room and they're like,

1584
00:44:02,631 --> 00:44:02,991
all right,

1585
00:44:02,991 --> 00:44:04,130
well you know,

1586
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:05,450
we're gonna need these.

1587
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:07,250
You're gonna have to put like
five stitches or whatever.

1588
00:44:07,251 --> 00:44:09,050
Twenty stitches in your finger.

1589
00:44:09,051 --> 00:44:09,321
He was like,

1590
00:44:09,321 --> 00:44:09,411
Nah,

1591
00:44:09,411 --> 00:44:10,520
I want to go back out there.

1592
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:11,031
And they were like,

1593
00:44:11,031 --> 00:44:11,670
well you'll,

1594
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:13,810
we'd have to cut off your finger
if you to go back out there.

1595
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:14,240
He was like,

1596
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:14,630
do it,

1597
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:15,051
do it.

1598
00:44:15,051 --> 00:44:16,300
They'll just fucking cut.

1599
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:17,750
Wait a minute.

1600
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:18,560
Wait.

1601
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,520
They could've fixed it.

1602
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:20,450
They could have fixed it,

1603
00:44:20,451 --> 00:44:22,460
but you wouldn't be playing that day.

1604
00:44:22,461 --> 00:44:25,480
So he said cut the playoffs and shit.

1605
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:26,600
How much of the finger?

1606
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:27,380
The just like.

1607
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:27,921
So there's no,

1608
00:44:27,921 --> 00:44:28,880
you don't see the nail.

1609
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:32,550
Like maybe that was an annoying
part of his whole masturbation

1610
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:33,280
ritual.

1611
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,070
It was secretly hoping to chew it away.

1612
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:35,913
Anyway.

1613
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:37,880
Powerful job.

1614
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:39,570
So right next door.

1615
00:44:39,571 --> 00:44:39,930
Um,

1616
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:42,210
you'll be able to get that on the
church and what's happening now,

1617
00:44:42,211 --> 00:44:45,330
right joey on itunes.

1618
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,000
There'll be able to get
yours with burt church.

1619
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:48,853
What's happening now?

1620
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:49,650
Yeah,

1621
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:50,790
it's on itunes.

1622
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:51,560
I was drunk.

1623
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:51,650
I,

1624
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:55,110
one of the greatest storytellers in the
world has ever known what he called me

1625
00:44:55,111 --> 00:44:56,190
when I was in New York and I was drunk.

1626
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:57,300
I don't know what we're doing.

1627
00:44:57,690 --> 00:45:00,120
I don't know if you're doing a standup
show or a podcast or you're doing a live

1628
00:45:00,121 --> 00:45:00,954
podcast,

1629
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,700
then you're going to do our standup show.

1630
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:02,910
Yeah,

1631
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:03,060
yeah.

1632
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:03,721
Then I'm doing that.

1633
00:45:03,721 --> 00:45:04,190
Yeah,

1634
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:04,911
but why you by just saying,

1635
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:05,251
Oh fuck,

1636
00:45:05,251 --> 00:45:06,380
I don't like that podcasts.

1637
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:06,691
Well,

1638
00:45:06,691 --> 00:45:08,400
it's an interesting one
because it's a small room.

1639
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:09,830
It's only like 50 people.

1640
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:12,030
I'm just going to sit there
and giggle my fucking ass off.

1641
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:13,080
You know,

1642
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:16,440
today we're driving in the car and he
goes and we're talking about health.

1643
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:16,801
And he goes,

1644
00:45:16,801 --> 00:45:17,060
AH,

1645
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:17,390
dog.

1646
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:18,480
I went to the doctor today.

1647
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:21,390
I dropped my pants and the
doctor looked up at him.

1648
00:45:21,391 --> 00:45:22,110
He goes,

1649
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:22,943
hey,

1650
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:24,310
you know you got toilet paper on

1651
00:45:29,290 --> 00:45:30,320
pass through it.

1652
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:36,423
He goes,

1653
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:38,350
I want to wipe the helmet
before I went in there.

1654
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:40,863
The helmet,

1655
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,730
I did notice a little piece of toilet
paper hanging off the end of the day.

1656
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:45,590
Hey,

1657
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:46,660
Dick sneezed a little.

1658
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,370
You know the answer as Joey.

1659
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:49,361
Hey Joey.

1660
00:45:49,361 --> 00:45:49,830
What's,

1661
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:50,470
uh,

1662
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:52,000
what's your first p of the day?

1663
00:45:52,001 --> 00:45:57,001
Smell like listerine and gunpowder
got shot out of an alien.

1664
00:45:57,510 --> 00:45:58,343
Sasol.

1665
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,233
It looks like

1666
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:07,360
Piss looks when you take too many
vitamins on an answer that Oh my God,

1667
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:09,663
he um,

1668
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,640
was it on your podcast that was on that?

1669
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:12,130
He said,

1670
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:12,963
you know,

1671
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:15,920
black people eat to talk

1672
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,670
bikeable sleep to eat,

1673
00:46:21,671 --> 00:46:22,504
to talk

1674
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:25,483
to the

1675
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:27,820
rest of the talk.

1676
00:46:27,821 --> 00:46:28,654
Yeah.

1677
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:31,373
Dad,

1678
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:34,860
why did you let him do that?

1679
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:35,760
Dad,

1680
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,430
you were there.

1681
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:37,120
It wasn't.

1682
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:37,651
Oh my God.

1683
00:46:37,651 --> 00:46:38,910
It just happened so quickly.

1684
00:46:38,911 --> 00:46:40,260
And your dad asked for them?

1685
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:40,500
No,

1686
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,580
you joyce grown ass,

1687
00:46:41,581 --> 00:46:41,941
man.

1688
00:46:41,941 --> 00:46:42,690
If he wanted one,

1689
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:43,770
you crack them open and he goes,

1690
00:46:43,771 --> 00:46:44,131
here you go,

1691
00:46:44,131 --> 00:46:44,820
Mr k.

1692
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:46,060
and just dumped somebody like that.

1693
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:46,931
What is it?

1694
00:46:46,931 --> 00:46:47,530
And he goes,

1695
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:48,240
candy,

1696
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:48,840
popcorn,

1697
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:49,580
you like it?

1698
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:50,660
My sit down,

1699
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:51,781
sit down and go,

1700
00:46:51,781 --> 00:46:51,991
dad,

1701
00:46:51,991 --> 00:46:52,980
there's marijuana in there.

1702
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:53,551
And he goes,

1703
00:46:53,551 --> 00:46:54,420
no buddy,

1704
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:55,560
it's good.

1705
00:46:56,490 --> 00:46:57,120
And I go,

1706
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:57,661
I go dad.

1707
00:46:57,661 --> 00:46:59,730
And then Joey's laughing hysterically.

1708
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:00,773
I'm like,

1709
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:01,500
I'm like,

1710
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:02,520
what are we going to do about this?

1711
00:47:02,521 --> 00:47:04,110
My sister has lost her fucking mind.

1712
00:47:04,111 --> 00:47:04,531
Everyone's like,

1713
00:47:04,531 --> 00:47:05,364
oh my God.

1714
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:06,001
And so yeah,

1715
00:47:06,001 --> 00:47:06,380
but,

1716
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:06,930
but he was,

1717
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:07,710
my dad was fine.

1718
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:08,610
You can't do that.

1719
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,410
The photos are photos that

1720
00:47:13,050 --> 00:47:14,520
I don't agree with doing that at all.

1721
00:47:14,521 --> 00:47:15,780
I did it with my own dad.

1722
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:16,370
Remembers.

1723
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:16,690
Yeah.

1724
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:17,600
But that's his dad.

1725
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:18,693
That's your thing.

1726
00:47:19,490 --> 00:47:20,101
It might now.

1727
00:47:20,101 --> 00:47:22,200
My Dad would never say
that he took it knowingly,

1728
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:22,850
but um,

1729
00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:23,910
I am way in my head.

1730
00:47:23,911 --> 00:47:24,121
I'm like,

1731
00:47:24,121 --> 00:47:26,160
there's no way joey slipped it to him.

1732
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,440
He must've said something.

1733
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:29,810
Maybe he just your dad,

1734
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:30,550
your

1735
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:32,750
dad didn't know what the Fuck Joey said.

1736
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:33,191
And he's like,

1737
00:47:33,191 --> 00:47:33,661
yeah,

1738
00:47:33,661 --> 00:47:34,190
sure,

1739
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:34,451
sure.

1740
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:36,460
But he probably has brain blacked out.

1741
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:39,020
You want to get high with me and Mr Kay,

1742
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:40,600
Mr Kay and my back.

1743
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:40,841
Dad,

1744
00:47:40,841 --> 00:47:41,740
just such a question.

1745
00:47:41,741 --> 00:47:42,510
Come on Cock sucker.

1746
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:44,620
What do we gain games are we go deep,

1747
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:45,480
deep,

1748
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:46,313
deep in me?

1749
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:48,460
Yeah,

1750
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,240
that's exactly what happened.

1751
00:47:52,241 --> 00:47:53,680
Is full of cookies.

1752
00:47:53,681 --> 00:47:58,681
Is wolfing down hurt to have
one cookie and our cookie

1753
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:03,850
times when someone's talking to you or
you're not even paying attention because

1754
00:48:03,851 --> 00:48:06,790
you're thinking about something else
and you're like giving them like a small

1755
00:48:06,791 --> 00:48:08,850
percentage and you're trying
to figure something out you.

1756
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:09,181
Oh yeah,

1757
00:48:09,181 --> 00:48:09,331

1758
00:48:09,331 --> 00:48:09,581

1759
00:48:09,581 --> 00:48:10,930
What are like taxi drivers?

1760
00:48:10,931 --> 00:48:11,141
You know,

1761
00:48:11,141 --> 00:48:14,110
you just hear the main
words money many times.

1762
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:15,120
My Dad has dragged

1763
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:16,090

1764

00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:36,063

They said they would pay for us if we
want to do an adventure because if they

1802
00:48:57,590 --> 00:48:58,210
can hear it,

1803
00:48:58,210 --> 00:48:58,521

What do you mean?

1809
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:03,230
I was sitting there,

1810
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:03,831
we were talking,

1811
00:49:03,831 --> 00:49:06,180
we just hadn't had a
dinner and there were um,

1812
00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:10,100
they asking questions or just kind of
getting hip to the podcast scene and they

1813
00:49:10,101 --> 00:49:11,350
were asking questions about that,

1814
00:49:11,351 --> 00:49:11,450
like,

1815
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:12,560
what is death squad?

1816
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:14,570
And I was Kinda just don't tell them

1817
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:16,330
particular to try to explain,

1818
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:17,253
you got to go.

1819
00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:18,231
I was like,

1820
00:49:18,231 --> 00:49:18,611
if you don't,

1821
00:49:18,611 --> 00:49:18,761
no,

1822
00:49:18,761 --> 00:49:19,594
you don't know,

1823
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,110
you don't know.

1824
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:21,170
And then they were like doing like,

1825
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:22,660
so these are all your buddies.

1826
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:23,081

do you ever want to do anything with them?

1830
00:49:24,971 --> 00:49:25,600
Like,

1831
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:26,920
and I jokingly said,

1832
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:27,820
I said,

1833
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:28,031
yeah,

1834
00:49:28,031 --> 00:49:31,750
we kind of just said this because Duncan
said at one time ago we kind of want to

1835
00:49:31,751 --> 00:49:35,770
take dugout canoes into the rain forest
and see if we can find Iowasca with our

1836
00:49:35,771 --> 00:49:36,400
dads.

1837
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:36,581
No,

1838
00:49:36,581 --> 00:49:37,360
just us,

1839
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:37,840
just us.

1840
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:38,500
And so then.

1841
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:39,560
So we were talking about dad.

1842
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:40,091
Oh No,

1843
00:49:40,091 --> 00:49:40,181
no,

1844
00:49:40,181 --> 00:49:40,361
no.

1845
00:49:40,361 --> 00:49:40,930
I don't know why.

1846
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:41,490
I don't know why.

1847
00:49:41,490 --> 00:49:42,220
You know what,

1848
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:42,850
how'd you get there?

1849
00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:44,690
I have no fucking idea how my brain it.

1850
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:46,750
You know what I was
thinking unrelated journey.

1851
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:47,470
I was thinking,

1852
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:50,740
I was thinking we should do a show where
we all take our dads and go do shit.

1853
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:51,910
In my head I was like,

1854
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:52,121
oh,

1855
00:49:52,121 --> 00:49:52,990
I have a better idea.

1856
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:53,853
You know what's fucked up?

1857
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:57,520
He was actually talking about people
that do that very thing earlier on the

1858
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:58,100
podcast.

1859
00:49:58,100 --> 00:49:58,933
Very negative,

1860
00:49:59,410 --> 00:49:59,710
very,

1861
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:00,570
very negative way.

1862
00:50:00,571 --> 00:50:01,930
It was about liars.

1863
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:02,640
Oh,

1864
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:07,640
it was not that at all was his.

1865
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:10,750
But he was talking about was about how,

1866
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:11,171
you know,

1867
00:50:11,171 --> 00:50:12,460
how some guys will go out.

1868
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:13,690
So what do you guys want to go see?

1869
00:50:13,691 --> 00:50:15,430
The movies wouldn't believe this man,

1870
00:50:15,431 --> 00:50:19,380
but I'm about to start a billion
dollar a year business kind of crazy.

1871
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:20,320
But uh,

1872
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,540
we're taking this from the
ground floor and Tommy was like,

1873
00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:23,990
you make $10 an hour.

1874
00:50:23,991 --> 00:50:25,470
What the fuck you talking about man?

1875
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:26,171
Well,

1876
00:50:26,171 --> 00:50:26,441
you know,

1877
00:50:26,441 --> 00:50:26,800
once,

1878
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,250
once we get the startup money,

1879
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:30,080
which is basically guaranteed.

1880
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:30,321
Yeah.

1881
00:50:30,321 --> 00:50:31,570
I got a couple of investors that got it.

1882
00:50:31,571 --> 00:50:31,980
I got to,

1883
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:32,813
I got an Italian,

1884
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:33,530
I,

1885
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:37,190
one in Czech Republic and we were
talking about what movie to go see.

1886
00:50:37,191 --> 00:50:37,341
Well,

1887
00:50:37,341 --> 00:50:38,420
how the fuck did we get here?

1888
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:38,750
Yeah,

1889
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:39,551
that's where you kind of did.

1890
00:50:39,551 --> 00:50:40,060
I just did,

1891
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:40,893
did that

1892
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:43,380
almost exactly like that.

1893
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:44,530
I was trying to.

1894
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:45,363
I was like,

1895
00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:47,070
my dad doesn't want to be on TV.

1896
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:48,060
I was like,

1897
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:49,170
I don't know where he's going with this,

1898
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:53,550
but it's exactly.

1899
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:55,100
It's funny on TV at all.

1900
00:50:55,110 --> 00:50:55,980
My Dad will be on TV.

1901
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,810
You're saying that your dad would
enjoy it as a fascinating guy.

1902
00:51:00,811 --> 00:51:01,231
I mean,

1903
00:51:01,231 --> 00:51:03,160
my dad's a very nice guy.

1904
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:03,520
He's,

1905
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:03,980
you know,

1906
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:06,530
he would be very polite and
friendly with everybody,

1907
00:51:06,531 --> 00:51:07,251
but my dad,

1908
00:51:07,251 --> 00:51:08,084
I don't think.

1909
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:09,160
Let's do it.

1910
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:09,993
Dad Show what?

1911
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:13,280
Pick it back up my nose.

1912
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:14,350
There's no way he would never do it.

1913
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:15,040
No.

1914
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,560
It's zero desire to be famous
and we cast it out for you.

1915
00:51:18,470 --> 00:51:19,510
Give me like a black guy,

1916
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:21,093
black guy.

1917
00:51:22,270 --> 00:51:23,890
Black Guy was only a couple
of years older than me.

1918
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:28,053
Four years old.

1919
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:36,300
Like Bernard Hopkins plays my dad and
no one even mentioned it the whole time

1920
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:36,571
though.

1921
00:51:36,571 --> 00:51:41,010
And Bernard Hopkins refuses to admit
it's him playing it on the show.

1922
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:41,270
Sure.

1923
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:42,011
And afterwards,

1924
00:51:42,011 --> 00:51:43,150
in every interview is,

1925
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:45,550
I don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

1926
00:51:45,551 --> 00:51:46,540
That's not me,

1927
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:47,613
but it is him.

1928
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,140
Take Bernard Hopkins
will go fishing with him.

1929
00:51:50,141 --> 00:51:51,450
I can't have to listen to it.

1930
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:52,570
You have good stories.

1931
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:54,130
Listen and tells me,

1932
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:55,030
you know,

1933
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:55,700
I'm listening to this.

1934
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:58,870
My Dad has to bring
back childhood memories,

1935
00:51:58,871 --> 00:52:01,380
but like it's like when joe was a kid
and he first learned how to ride a bike

1936
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:03,343
like Joe.

1937
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:07,380
You remember when I took
Joe to the holiday and you
remember that Joe and making

1938
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:12,290
some motherfuckers lying in his
bed playing with chimpanzee doll.

1939
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:14,470
Bernard Hopkins owns the right to the,

1940
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:15,281
to the title.

1941
00:52:15,281 --> 00:52:16,114
I am the machine.

1942
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:18,720
How do I know that's a.

1943
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:19,630
maybe that might be an API,

1944
00:52:19,631 --> 00:52:20,464
right?

1945
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:25,600
Get outta here.

1946
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:30,550
You tarnish your reputation
and doubly later brother,

1947
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:31,543
we'll see in a bit.

1948
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:34,150
Bert Kreischer will be joining us tonight.

1949
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,060
These sold out ice house,

1950
00:52:36,061 --> 00:52:39,700
kind of a club show along with his
man that I'm talking to right now,

1951
00:52:39,701 --> 00:52:40,810
Tom Segura.

1952
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:42,460
So exactly what.

1953
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:44,560
And I wasn't thinking of him at all,

1954
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:46,180
but it was perfect.

1955
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:48,721
It was perfect.

1956
00:52:48,721 --> 00:52:49,410
You sort of,

1957
00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:49,680
you know,

1958
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:50,340
but it wasn't.

1959
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:50,551
No,

1960
00:52:50,551 --> 00:52:50,881
he wasn't.

1961
00:52:50,881 --> 00:52:51,790
He's not a crazy person,

1962
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:52,983
but does,

1963
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:53,311
he?

1964
00:52:53,311 --> 00:52:55,170
Does make me think what
we were talking about,

1965
00:52:55,171 --> 00:52:57,540
which is like a lot of times I go.

1966
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,220
How does fucking Birch brainwork yeah,

1967
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,230
I think that all the time.

1968
00:53:01,231 --> 00:53:01,940
Yeah.

1969
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:02,370
How did,

1970
00:53:02,370 --> 00:53:03,390
how did he get there?

1971
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:05,760
You know which being you do
when you're sitting around?

1972
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:06,840
He's not even high though.

1973
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:07,860
He didn't even get high.

1974
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:08,180
No.

1975
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:12,020
So he's got no God damn excuse you just
showed up and I just didn't know where

1976
00:53:12,021 --> 00:53:13,290
it was going with the dad thing.

1977
00:53:13,291 --> 00:53:15,420
I was like dance on vacation,

1978
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:16,843
adventure.

1979
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:20,550
But somehow those things
do connect in his brain.

1980
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:21,091
You know what I'm saying?

1981
00:53:21,091 --> 00:53:21,680
Like we go.

1982
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:22,410
I don't think so.

1983
00:53:22,410 --> 00:53:25,830
I'm just waiting for an opportunity to
talk about doing something together.

1984
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:26,550
Yeah.

1985
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:30,690
I think it was more that I do want to
go chameleon like fucking really bad.

1986
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:31,610
Do you guys ever used to go?

1987
00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:32,580
Meanwhile,

1988
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:35,820
middle of the night fucking forest is on
fire because Brian left behind when it

1989
00:53:35,821 --> 00:53:39,990
lit cigarette to I don't want to go
canoeing with Ui up there in a river.

1990
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:40,441
Wait,

1991
00:53:40,441 --> 00:53:41,060
what happened?

1992
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:41,400
You,

1993
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,260
you like spiked your dad?

1994
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:46,200
Like you didn't finish that
or when did you do that?

1995
00:53:46,201 --> 00:53:48,060
To your dad when you told
them you were doing it though,

1996
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:48,993
right?

1997
00:53:49,930 --> 00:53:50,763
Whoops.

1998
00:53:50,910 --> 00:53:51,743
Hey listen.

1999
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:53,490
I mean sure you did.

2000
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:53,671
Well,

2001
00:53:53,671 --> 00:53:54,504
you brought it up.

2002
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:58,080
Remembered on me.

2003
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:01,860
Joe Joe gave me this
big bottle of pop soda,

2004
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:02,491
you know,

2005
00:54:02,491 --> 00:54:04,610
that was made out of marijuana and uh,

2006
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:08,910
I had it in my fridge for awhile and
then me and my fiance at the time,

2007
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:11,360
we're all recording ourselves like a,

2008
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:16,020
cause my dad was in town for the night
and I think I put the camera down and

2009
00:54:16,021 --> 00:54:17,040
then he is like,

2010
00:54:17,041 --> 00:54:17,221
oh,

2011
00:54:17,221 --> 00:54:19,500
I'm going to have some of this
wine or champagne or whatever.

2012
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:19,741
And I'm like,

2013
00:54:19,741 --> 00:54:20,551
that's not champagne.

2014
00:54:20,551 --> 00:54:21,301
That's okay.

2015
00:54:21,301 --> 00:54:21,481
Yeah,

2016
00:54:21,481 --> 00:54:22,314
you can drink that.

2017
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:24,390
And then I just like let him drink it.

2018
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:29,640
And then like in like within like half
hour or so he just became so giggly and

2019
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:33,090
just laughing and it was really actually
one of the coolest things ever because

2020
00:54:33,091 --> 00:54:33,331
like,

2021
00:54:33,331 --> 00:54:34,440
did he freak out at all?

2022
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:34,660
No,

2023
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:35,131
not at all.

2024
00:54:35,131 --> 00:54:35,731
He was just like,

2025
00:54:35,731 --> 00:54:37,320
almost like a happy drunk,

2026
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:40,770
but where he was just kind
of giggling and laughing.

2027
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,060
Did you ever tell him what happened?

2028
00:54:42,061 --> 00:54:42,510
No.

2029
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:43,350
Never be probably,

2030
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,040
no,

2031
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:46,050
but you should tell him
because he would enjoy it.

2032
00:54:46,390 --> 00:54:47,000
Yeah.

2033
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:47,510
You know,

2034
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:49,920
I mean maybe it'd be one of those
things that he discovered late in life,

2035
00:54:49,921 --> 00:54:50,431
like wow,

2036
00:54:50,431 --> 00:54:52,530
their slates makes life
so much more enjoyable,

2037
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:55,380
but you'd have to get it to
them in that form though.

2038
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:55,920
Right.

2039
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:59,010
That's the coolest forums that
the edible forms the best form.

2040
00:54:59,160 --> 00:54:59,993
I think

2041
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:02,490
I like it the most.

2042
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:02,940
Oh Shit.

2043
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:03,270
Sorry.

2044
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:04,560
As long as it's mild,

2045
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:06,360
as long as it's not like super strong,

2046
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:08,040
the effects are like really pleasant.

2047
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:11,100
Superstrong can bring strong is not good.

2048
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:12,980
That's a terrible feeling of.

2049
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:16,050
I'm just trying to relax
and get through this day.

2050
00:55:16,051 --> 00:55:18,800
I don't need to be contemplating the
fate of the fucking galaxy youth.

2051
00:55:18,890 --> 00:55:21,720
Do you like in a super
strong to psychedelic?

2052
00:55:21,721 --> 00:55:22,610
Is that what happens?

2053
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:24,000
It is very much so.

2054
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:24,781
In fact,

2055
00:55:24,781 --> 00:55:27,090
in a lot of the ancient Hindu writings,

2056
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:29,250
a lot of what they talked about,

2057
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:32,760
really extreme psychedelic
experiences that they,

2058
00:55:32,761 --> 00:55:32,971
uh,

2059
00:55:32,971 --> 00:55:33,900
they talked about it.

2060
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:35,880
We're all from eating hash.

2061
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:36,743
Really?

2062
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:37,200
Yeah.

2063
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,670
Eating cannabis can,

2064
00:55:38,770 --> 00:55:40,140
if you eat enough of it,

2065
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:44,220
you can have an experience that is
every bit as strong as mushrooms.

2066
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:44,701
Really?

2067
00:55:44,701 --> 00:55:45,001
Yeah.

2068
00:55:45,001 --> 00:55:45,811
You just have to eat.

2069
00:55:45,811 --> 00:55:46,644
A lot of it.

2070
00:55:46,730 --> 00:55:47,450
I've had.

2071
00:55:47,450 --> 00:55:49,710
I've been moved to tears a few times.

2072
00:55:49,711 --> 00:55:51,870
I've had experiences in the tank.

2073
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:52,650
Eating,

2074
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:56,280
eating pot are like a fucking,

2075
00:55:56,370 --> 00:55:58,080
like a ride to the movie,

2076
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,580
like experience that you
wouldn't believe if if you.

2077
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,990
If you didn't see it
with your own synapses,

2078
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:05,550
if you weren't going through it,

2079
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:07,110
it seems impossible.

2080
00:56:07,370 --> 00:56:08,670
It's all just eating pot,

2081
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:10,530
eating pot and getting into a tank.

2082
00:56:10,850 --> 00:56:13,010
The tank filled with water and the show,

2083
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,500
but you have to eat that.

2084
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,450
You got to get to that critical level
where you feel like you eat too much.

2085
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:20,400
That's where you gotta get you gotTa.

2086
00:56:20,430 --> 00:56:21,360
Get to that feeling where you're like,

2087
00:56:21,390 --> 00:56:21,511
oh,

2088
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:22,350
I fucked up.

2089
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:23,470
I fucked up,

2090
00:56:23,470 --> 00:56:24,100
and that's when

2091
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:26,010
you can close your eyes and see nobody.

2092
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:26,440
Shit.

2093
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:27,670
Like how much are you talking about?

2094
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:28,150
Well,

2095
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:29,530
you see it in the dark.

2096
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:29,861
See,

2097
00:56:29,861 --> 00:56:30,700
that's when you see it,

2098
00:56:30,701 --> 00:56:31,421
like you don't see it.

2099
00:56:31,421 --> 00:56:32,290
If you open your eyes,

2100
00:56:32,291 --> 00:56:33,101
if you open your eyes,

2101
00:56:33,101 --> 00:56:34,090
you're not going to hallucinate.

2102
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:38,350
It's not like it's going to misinterpret
visual cues and real information,

2103
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:42,880
but what it will do is supercharge your
imagination to the point where it can't

2104
00:56:42,881 --> 00:56:44,050
deal with a blank slate.

2105
00:56:44,590 --> 00:56:45,670
So when you,

2106
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:46,960
when you eat the pot,

2107
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:47,891
you close,

2108
00:56:47,891 --> 00:56:51,310
you either close your eyes like I've had
this habit on planes before where I ate

2109
00:56:51,311 --> 00:56:53,470
a cookie before I got to the airport,

2110
00:56:53,590 --> 00:56:54,910
and then while I'm on the plane,

2111
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:56,260
you're tripping your balls off.

2112
00:56:56,460 --> 00:57:00,050
When you close your eyes and the
darkness of your closed eyes,

2113
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:02,650
that's when your
imagination starts firing.

2114
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:04,810
When you start seeing wild,

2115
00:57:04,811 --> 00:57:08,500
crazy neon colors like fucking,

2116
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:09,161
you know,

2117
00:57:09,161 --> 00:57:09,530
like you,

2118
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:10,810
you start seeing like,

2119
00:57:10,850 --> 00:57:13,330
like computer cartoon,

2120
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:16,060
fractal shows.

2121
00:57:16,150 --> 00:57:17,320
It becomes very,

2122
00:57:17,321 --> 00:57:22,150
very bizarre and that's just closing
your eyes on a plane inside the tank.

2123
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:23,350
It can really like.

2124
00:57:23,351 --> 00:57:26,110
It almost like opens up
another realm of experience.

2125
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:27,190
Kids.

2126
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:30,040
Very strange because in
the absence of light,

2127
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:30,791
this,

2128
00:57:30,791 --> 00:57:34,990
all this stuff flying through your
brain sort of manifests itself as visual

2129
00:57:34,991 --> 00:57:35,824
information.

2130
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:40,180
You don't just get the feeling
like life's slipping away.

2131
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:40,880
You get,

2132
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,730
you get that feeling
when your eyes are open,

2133
00:57:42,731 --> 00:57:44,050
but everything looks normal.

2134
00:57:44,110 --> 00:57:44,860
You know,

2135
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:48,280
everything looks a little faker and
everything looks kind of two dimensional,

2136
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:49,750
a little closer that it should be,

2137
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:51,100
but it still looks normal,

2138
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:52,960
but when you close your eyes,

2139
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:55,090
then you get the fucking color show.

2140
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:57,940
Just madness and
craziness in front of you.

2141
00:57:58,660 --> 00:57:58,871
Yeah.

2142
00:57:58,871 --> 00:58:01,330
I've had an absolute freak out.

2143
00:58:01,630 --> 00:58:02,261
Oh my God.

2144
00:58:02,261 --> 00:58:04,330
Blowing my mind experiences eating it.

2145
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:04,631
Yeah.

2146
00:58:04,631 --> 00:58:05,500
You just have to eat it.

2147
00:58:05,890 --> 00:58:07,040
How much do you have?

2148
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:09,490
What's the most you've consumed like?

2149
00:58:09,491 --> 00:58:09,581
Well,

2150
00:58:09,581 --> 00:58:10,181
there's always going to say.

2151
00:58:10,181 --> 00:58:11,920
There was a friend who made pills.

2152
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:16,330
He made a thc pills and
I forget how he did it.

2153
00:58:17,090 --> 00:58:21,670
I forget what his process
was of extracting the thc
and putting it into pill

2154
00:58:21,671 --> 00:58:22,300
form,

2155
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:24,400
but he told us very specifically,

2156
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:25,690
only take one.

2157
00:58:26,350 --> 00:58:26,651
He said,

2158
00:58:26,651 --> 00:58:27,880
do not take more than one.

2159
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:29,110
I only took one.

2160
00:58:29,111 --> 00:58:32,290
I listened to any bravo took to eddie.

2161
00:58:32,291 --> 00:58:34,240
Bravo was one of those silly bitches,

2162
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:37,090
like I can't even get to high.

2163
00:58:37,091 --> 00:58:39,030
It's impossible to high.

2164
00:58:39,031 --> 00:58:43,270
You could and it was unbelievably strong.

2165
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:44,051
Just one.

2166
00:58:44,051 --> 00:58:44,561
I was like,

2167
00:58:44,561 --> 00:58:45,490
where is this?

2168
00:58:45,491 --> 00:58:50,491
Do travel in everyday this do it is
going to cover raising town every day and

2169
00:58:51,101 --> 00:58:54,400
that's something that a lot of people
are overlooking about this whole medical

2170
00:58:54,401 --> 00:58:55,360
marijuana movement.

2171
00:58:55,510 --> 00:58:57,910
Everyone's focusing on smoking pot.

2172
00:58:58,060 --> 00:59:00,520
We don't want people smoking pot.

2173
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:00,980
Well,

2174
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:04,510
the eating pot is five times stronger,

2175
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:09,550
five times more psychoactive when you
eat it and you're getting guys just

2176
00:59:09,551 --> 00:59:11,140
loading up these cookies,

2177
00:59:11,141 --> 00:59:12,730
loading up these candies,

2178
00:59:12,970 --> 00:59:15,550
and you can eat three or four of them
before you even know what the fuck's going

2179
00:59:15,551 --> 00:59:19,640
on and then an hour and 20 minutes
later you're on your deathbed.

2180
00:59:20,270 --> 00:59:21,950
You're freaking fuck out.

2181
00:59:21,951 --> 00:59:22,160
Like

2182
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:22,993
Yoshi,

2183
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:23,850
Yoshi,

2184
00:59:23,850 --> 00:59:24,950
like banana bread.

2185
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:28,550
Joey ideas actually had a funny story
from a long time ago when listerine strips

2186
00:59:28,551 --> 00:59:29,690
first came out for that pot,

2187
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:33,310
listerine strips and they used to have
like the little containers just like I'm

2188
00:59:33,311 --> 00:59:37,280
in it and he had a whole
one in and his friends,

2189
00:59:37,281 --> 00:59:37,491
I can,

2190
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:38,324
I have one.

2191
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:41,900
And he takes it out and they had all
melted together and there were like nine

2192
00:59:41,901 --> 00:59:44,470
strips melted together
and is it says like,

2193
00:59:44,510 --> 00:59:44,631
oh,

2194
00:59:44,631 --> 00:59:45,350
I guess that's it.

2195
00:59:45,350 --> 00:59:45,740
You know?

2196
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:46,670
And then I gave it to,

2197
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:53,710
I guess the guy called the ambulance
like 10 times the amount of those strong,

2198
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:58,670
super strong to take one
half of those breast trips.

2199
00:59:58,671 --> 00:59:59,900
It's really hard to find them now.

2200
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:01,250
They don't have them anymore,

2201
01:00:01,370 --> 01:00:04,430
but I used to take one
half of one and that's all.

2202
01:00:04,431 --> 01:00:05,030
It took.

2203
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:07,940
One half of one you gave me that one time.

2204
01:00:08,490 --> 01:00:11,150
Jesus Christ.

2205
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:13,460
That was when we were
headed to the east coast.

2206
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,010
We were on a red eye and I remember,

2207
01:00:16,030 --> 01:00:16,401
uh,

2208
01:00:16,401 --> 01:00:16,591
we,

2209
01:00:16,591 --> 01:00:17,950
we both landed and you were like,

2210
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:20,300
that is the highest I've
ever been in my lab.

2211
01:00:20,301 --> 01:00:21,240
I go right there on that plane.

2212
01:00:21,241 --> 01:00:22,820
And you go right there on the plane?

2213
01:00:22,970 --> 01:00:23,250
Yeah,

2214
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:23,481
I go.

2215
01:00:23,481 --> 01:00:24,060
What was that like?

2216
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:24,840
Was that with.

2217
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:25,910
That wasn't an adventure.

2218
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:26,481
Yeah,

2219
01:00:26,481 --> 01:00:27,080
it was.

2220
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:31,610
And I also remember that I buzzed
by no means not high anymore.

2221
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:36,410
When I said that and I felt
like leg 11 hours later,

2222
01:00:36,411 --> 01:00:37,950
I was like still kind of feeling it right?

2223
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:39,290
Like yeah dude,

2224
01:00:39,590 --> 01:00:41,360
that shit kicked my ass.

2225
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:42,500
It was unbelievable.

2226
01:00:42,501 --> 01:00:43,550
That was only a half.

2227
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:45,680
I can't imagine taking more than that.

2228
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:49,670
I actually started after that
I realized that I'm like,

2229
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:54,700
for me to not have that feeling
a quarter of a strip was,

2230
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:55,940
was better.

2231
01:00:55,940 --> 01:00:56,421
You know what I mean?

2232
01:00:56,421 --> 01:00:58,640
Like I could function on a quarter.

2233
01:00:59,090 --> 01:00:59,740
Yeah,

2234
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:01,390
not on the half men.

2235
01:01:03,610 --> 01:01:04,450
I don't like eating anywhere.

2236
01:01:04,451 --> 01:01:08,260
I had one the other day and I didn't
think I felt it the whole night.

2237
01:01:08,470 --> 01:01:09,940
Like I took around 8:00,

2238
01:01:10,060 --> 01:01:11,470
around 11 or 12.

2239
01:01:11,471 --> 01:01:11,711
I was like,

2240
01:01:11,711 --> 01:01:11,891
all right,

2241
01:01:11,891 --> 01:01:13,480
I guess so that was just a shitty edible.

2242
01:01:13,630 --> 01:01:16,240
Then I couldn't go to bed and it started
like my heart started going crazy.

2243
01:01:16,241 --> 01:01:16,481
I was like,

2244
01:01:16,481 --> 01:01:16,731
all right.

2245
01:01:16,731 --> 01:01:20,230
Now starting right now it's like one in
the morning and how long did it take to

2246
01:01:20,231 --> 01:01:21,064
kick in?

2247
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:26,020
Four or five hours on
a blockage somewhere,

2248
01:01:26,021 --> 01:01:26,381
son.

2249
01:01:26,381 --> 01:01:27,250
That doesn't even make sense.

2250
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:29,200
That doesn't make sense.

2251
01:01:29,201 --> 01:01:30,580
You just defied logic.

2252
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:31,690
You defied science.

2253
01:01:31,691 --> 01:01:32,530
You broke medicine,

2254
01:01:33,070 --> 01:01:35,400
but I couldn't go to sleep
though for like hours.

2255
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:36,100
Wow.

2256
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:39,640
Maybe just took you a while to realize
you were high or were you like caffeine,

2257
01:01:39,641 --> 01:01:41,830
dap and maybe it was having
a hard time getting in there?

2258
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:41,981
Yeah,

2259
01:01:41,981 --> 01:01:44,680
I think I must have had too
much other food in my stomach.

2260
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:48,400
Maybe it just took a while to digest it
or that's another possibility if you ate

2261
01:01:48,401 --> 01:01:49,091
something heavy,

2262
01:01:49,091 --> 01:01:49,361
right.

2263
01:01:49,361 --> 01:01:50,410
If that's behind it.

2264
01:01:50,470 --> 01:01:51,101
Is that happened?

2265
01:01:51,101 --> 01:01:51,934
Is it working with that?

2266
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:52,690
I think so.

2267
01:01:52,690 --> 01:01:53,231
Totally right.

2268
01:01:53,231 --> 01:01:53,690
Yeah.

2269
01:01:53,690 --> 01:01:54,000
Yeah.

2270
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:54,970
It was like busy.

2271
01:01:55,050 --> 01:01:57,220
Is your body has to do is break
it down and just get to it,

2272
01:01:57,370 --> 01:02:00,910
which totally unscientific when it
comes to understanding of the digestive

2273
01:02:00,911 --> 01:02:01,360
system.

2274
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:02,210
You know what I'm saying?

2275
01:02:02,350 --> 01:02:02,940
The juices.

2276
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:04,460
Break it down the brain juice.

2277
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:06,750
Yeah.

2278
01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:07,583
I don't,

2279
01:02:07,870 --> 01:02:09,070
I don't think we were right about that,

2280
01:02:09,071 --> 01:02:09,730
but yeah,

2281
01:02:09,730 --> 01:02:10,240
the uh,

2282
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,790
I think if anybody should be
concerned about experiences,

2283
01:02:12,791 --> 01:02:15,790
it's the eating it because I don't
want anybody to have bad trips,

2284
01:02:15,791 --> 01:02:16,100
man.

2285
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:16,230
Yeah,

2286
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:17,230
it's bad trips.

2287
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:19,920
Steer people away from weed
and you don't get anything

2288
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:23,700
out of those bad edible trips either
because they usually come when you don't

2289
01:02:23,701 --> 01:02:24,390
expect them.

2290
01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:26,700
Like they come when you're
trying to go to a movie,

2291
01:02:26,750 --> 01:02:28,170
have a plot cookie with your friends,

2292
01:02:28,171 --> 01:02:31,890
go to a movie and Giggle and
the POC cook who fucking.

2293
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:34,410
Everybody just wants to go home,

2294
01:02:34,411 --> 01:02:35,730
you just got to get out of there.

2295
01:02:35,731 --> 01:02:36,564
Everybody wants to leave.

2296
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:39,090
Panic is never a good time
and that's what it is.

2297
01:02:39,410 --> 01:02:42,520
You are in like you have super anxiety.

2298
01:02:42,521 --> 01:02:42,730
Go.

2299
01:02:42,730 --> 01:02:43,530
At least I do.

2300
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:44,410
And that's not like,

2301
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:45,450
that's not fun man.

2302
01:02:45,451 --> 01:02:46,020
You don't go.

2303
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:48,810
That was really cool to add panicked
for my life for a few hours,

2304
01:02:48,930 --> 01:02:49,500
you know,

2305
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:52,350
just from sitting there when
I was in full panic mode.

2306
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:52,681
Okay.

2307
01:02:52,681 --> 01:02:57,681
From taking this one one a pill
when Eddie Bravo had taken to.

2308
01:02:58,350 --> 01:03:01,860
I was in full panic mode and I was
talking to this dude and the dude I was

2309
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:06,861
talking to was say a very high level
Jujitsu guy who also apparently was a

2310
01:03:06,931 --> 01:03:11,430
rapist and a while I was
talking to him so high.

2311
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:13,000
I mean I'm just so hard,

2312
01:03:13,010 --> 01:03:14,490
really shouldn't be talking to anybody,

2313
01:03:14,790 --> 01:03:15,960
but why I'm talking to this guy.

2314
01:03:15,961 --> 01:03:16,231
I'm like,

2315
01:03:16,231 --> 01:03:16,531
man,

2316
01:03:16,531 --> 01:03:18,690
this guy is a fucking killer.

2317
01:03:18,930 --> 01:03:20,040
Like he's got this.

2318
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:22,410
Just feel about them.

2319
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,630
Like he feels super dangerous,

2320
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:25,080
you know?

2321
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:27,360
He's a like a really
high level Jujitsu guy,

2322
01:03:27,361 --> 01:03:28,350
but he also feels like,

2323
01:03:28,351 --> 01:03:28,651
wow,

2324
01:03:28,651 --> 01:03:30,900
like if you were alone in
the woods with this guy,

2325
01:03:31,110 --> 01:03:31,441
you know,

2326
01:03:31,441 --> 01:03:33,150
and you'd gone for a
few days without food,

2327
01:03:33,151 --> 01:03:34,670
he might fucking eat you.

2328
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:38,220
And then later after that had happened,

2329
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:39,720
he turned out that he was a rapist.

2330
01:03:39,721 --> 01:03:40,620
He got arrested,

2331
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:41,431
but he didn't.

2332
01:03:41,431 --> 01:03:43,740
He didn't get arrested
by the way he fleet.

2333
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:48,780
And the way they caught him was
he started doing Jujitsu again.

2334
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:53,640
He couldn't stop doing Jujitsu and they
started doing Jujitsu at a new gym and

2335
01:03:53,641 --> 01:03:57,960
he didn't realize how obvious it is
that he's like a super high level guy.

2336
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:00,570
It's not that many high
level guys know when you get.

2337
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:01,770
I mean there are quite a few,

2338
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:02,930
but I mean it,

2339
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:03,560
you know,

2340
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:04,710
maybe maybe there's hundreds,

2341
01:04:04,711 --> 01:04:08,310
but the people in the Jujitsu world are
pretty much aware of a guy that's that

2342
01:04:08,311 --> 01:04:11,100
high level and this guy
was just tapping everybody,

2343
01:04:11,101 --> 01:04:12,480
including their best black belts.

2344
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:13,411
And everybody's like,

2345
01:04:13,411 --> 01:04:13,651
okay,

2346
01:04:13,651 --> 01:04:14,484
what is this?

2347
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:15,493
Who is this dude?

2348
01:04:15,530 --> 01:04:15,901
And he says,

2349
01:04:15,901 --> 01:04:16,734
he's from Brazil,

2350
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:19,380
and so someone's got a
picture of him or something.

2351
01:04:19,381 --> 01:04:19,681
And they went,

2352
01:04:19,681 --> 01:04:20,071
oh my God,

2353
01:04:20,071 --> 01:04:20,904
that's that guy.

2354
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:22,170
And he's wanted for rape.

2355
01:04:22,590 --> 01:04:23,220
He couldn't.

2356
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:26,250
He couldn't go on the
Lam and not do Jujitsu.

2357
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:27,001
That's incredible.

2358
01:04:27,001 --> 01:04:27,630
It's amazing.

2359
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:28,380
Yeah.

2360
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:30,000
I mean maybe they would've
gotten them anyway.

2361
01:04:30,490 --> 01:04:31,323
I don't know.

2362
01:04:31,630 --> 01:04:32,161
Two things.

2363
01:04:32,161 --> 01:04:34,950
I got to have his Jujitsu
and raping people.

2364
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:36,600
Grape juice.

2365
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:39,000
I got to be able to do both of
those things to be a happy guy.

2366
01:04:39,110 --> 01:04:39,460
Yeah.

2367
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:41,760
He gave off this weird dangerous energy,

2368
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:42,420
you know,

2369
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:47,420
especially when you're that cranked
out on the wrong side of the pot.

2370
01:04:47,581 --> 01:04:48,370
Rainbow,

2371
01:04:48,370 --> 01:04:48,860
you know,

2372
01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:49,350
it was just.

2373
01:04:49,350 --> 01:04:53,290
I was in the never world I was in the
world of fairies and elves and dwarves and

2374
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:55,620
monsters and dragons in the night.

2375
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:56,670
Well that's the things.

2376
01:04:56,670 --> 01:04:57,390
If you're having that,

2377
01:04:57,390 --> 01:04:58,990
that type of a experience,

2378
01:04:58,991 --> 01:04:59,824
that trip,

2379
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:04,110
you've eaten too much and you happened
to be in a not cool environment,

2380
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:07,050
like if you're in an
already dangerous situation.

2381
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:08,040
Oh my God.

2382
01:05:08,110 --> 01:05:08,943
Yeah.

2383
01:05:09,510 --> 01:05:10,560
Somebody get us home,

2384
01:05:10,561 --> 01:05:11,010
please.

2385
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:13,020
God get us home right now
and get us out of here.

2386
01:05:13,590 --> 01:05:14,423
Yeah,

2387
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:14,750
yeah.

2388
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:15,960
There's bad spots in the world.

2389
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:21,140
Imagine eating a cookie and go to Karachi
in the middle of Pakistan watching

2390
01:05:22,181 --> 01:05:24,490
people pull up with mopeds
and gun people down.

2391
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:25,330
You see that on vice.

2392
01:05:25,330 --> 01:05:26,470
The dangerous border went.

2393
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:27,160
Oh,

2394
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:27,850
fantastic.

2395
01:05:27,850 --> 01:05:28,301
Amazing.

2396
01:05:28,301 --> 01:05:29,110
What an amazing,

2397
01:05:29,110 --> 01:05:30,010
amazing access.

2398
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:31,450
We had shane it in here.

2399
01:05:31,451 --> 01:05:34,150
He was telling us about
Karachi and how insane it is.

2400
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:35,230
That looks insane.

2401
01:05:35,710 --> 01:05:38,020
Like millions of people on this one.

2402
01:05:38,021 --> 01:05:38,830
Giant city,

2403
01:05:38,830 --> 01:05:39,531
I think it's $20,

2404
01:05:39,531 --> 01:05:40,150
million.

2405
01:05:40,150 --> 01:05:40,930
Something crazy.

2406
01:05:40,930 --> 01:05:42,470
A lot of people and crimes.

2407
01:05:42,490 --> 01:05:43,750
Just running a muck.

2408
01:05:43,810 --> 01:05:48,810
Who says they hate their neighbors so
much and they are hated so much too.

2409
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:50,291
So crazy.

2410
01:05:50,291 --> 01:05:50,890
He.

2411
01:05:50,890 --> 01:05:52,060
The way he described it to me,

2412
01:05:52,061 --> 01:05:52,894
he was like,

2413
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:56,230
it literally is like the
scariest place on earth.

2414
01:05:56,530 --> 01:05:57,850
Like you can't believe it exists.

2415
01:05:57,851 --> 01:06:02,851
It's like the apocalypse in a city and
it's there right now and nobody's talking

2416
01:06:02,951 --> 01:06:03,540
about it.

2417
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:03,940
Nobody.

2418
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:04,420
Nobody.

2419
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:05,740
Nobody even thinks about it.

2420
01:06:05,950 --> 01:06:07,210
When you talk about dangerous places,

2421
01:06:07,211 --> 01:06:08,440
people talk about like Detroit.

2422
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:12,520
Detroit is not nearly
as dangerous as karate.

2423
01:06:12,550 --> 01:06:13,383
Have you had Malan?

2424
01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:15,530
Have you ever had him on the
show because mailed on Johnny?

2425
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:15,760
No.

2426
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:16,270
Who's that?

2427
01:06:16,270 --> 01:06:19,070
He's a comic from Pakistan.

2428
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:20,080
From from Karachi.

2429
01:06:20,110 --> 01:06:20,730
Oh really?

2430
01:06:20,730 --> 01:06:21,050
Yeah.

2431
01:06:21,050 --> 01:06:21,883
Whoa.

2432
01:06:21,910 --> 01:06:23,020
He's really good comic.

2433
01:06:23,110 --> 01:06:24,040
Like where's he from?

2434
01:06:24,070 --> 01:06:26,050
Like this in America.

2435
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:26,913
Does he live in la?

2436
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:27,813
He lives in La.

2437
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:29,890
He came over when he was 19.

2438
01:06:30,010 --> 01:06:30,880
How do you say his name again?

2439
01:06:30,950 --> 01:06:31,690
Kumail.

2440
01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:32,380
Kumail.

2441
01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:33,213
Nanjiani.

2442
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:33,910
Nanjiani.

2443
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:34,200
Yeah.

2444
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:35,010
He's a really,

2445
01:06:35,010 --> 01:06:35,843
really good comic,

2446
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:39,240
like really good moms
casts a long time ago,

2447
01:06:39,330 --> 01:06:39,931
long time ago.

2448
01:06:39,931 --> 01:06:41,190
I mean he's very successful,

2449
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:42,360
like he does very well.

2450
01:06:42,361 --> 01:06:42,690
I mean,

2451
01:06:42,690 --> 01:06:43,290
yeah,

2452
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:44,910
I mean he just did an hour special.

2453
01:06:45,090 --> 01:06:45,460
He's a,

2454
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:47,360
he's acting in like
all kinds of like he's,

2455
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:49,520
he does really well and he's like,

2456
01:06:49,530 --> 01:06:51,420
he's a super really,

2457
01:06:51,450 --> 01:06:55,320
like the thing that I was obsessed with
when I had him on was that he didn't

2458
01:06:55,650 --> 01:06:56,190
like,

2459
01:06:56,190 --> 01:06:59,220
he grew up there and he didn't,

2460
01:06:59,250 --> 01:07:00,083
uh,

2461
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:05,700
he didn't like watch standup growing up
and he came into college at 19 and he's

2462
01:07:06,811 --> 01:07:08,280
so good at it that I'm like,

2463
01:07:08,550 --> 01:07:08,701
yeah,

2464
01:07:08,701 --> 01:07:12,570
but I just don't understand how you're
good at it because like how is your sense

2465
01:07:12,571 --> 01:07:14,580
of humor developed?

2466
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:17,220
You started at like basically 19,

2467
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:22,280
like being exposed to this at all and
he's like exceptionally good at it.

2468
01:07:22,620 --> 01:07:23,640
So you,

2469
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:28,230
you see like he just has such
a command of doing standup,

2470
01:07:28,231 --> 01:07:29,040
like everything,

2471
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:30,630
like really insightful,

2472
01:07:30,631 --> 01:07:31,464
smart,

2473
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:32,333
really,

2474
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:33,690
really good writer performer.

2475
01:07:33,691 --> 01:07:38,691
It's so funny and I just
fascinated at his whole background,

2476
01:07:38,941 --> 01:07:39,760
his whole story.

2477
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:39,911
Yeah.

2478
01:07:39,911 --> 01:07:44,080
That is interesting because there are
cultures that do not have standup comedy,

2479
01:07:44,081 --> 01:07:44,411
right?

2480
01:07:44,411 --> 01:07:44,770
I mean yeah,

2481
01:07:44,770 --> 01:07:45,790
he definitely didn't have it.

2482
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:50,791
They all have some sort of public
gathering before someone gets to talk.

2483
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:52,120
But for entertainment,

2484
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:54,040
I mean how many places have it

2485
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:56,800
just breaking out in some
parts of the world now?

2486
01:07:56,830 --> 01:08:00,100
Like I know in a lot of
Spanish speaking countries,

2487
01:08:00,101 --> 01:08:02,900
you know there are clubs now and you know,

2488
01:08:03,110 --> 01:08:04,360
a stand up show,

2489
01:08:04,570 --> 01:08:05,980
a unit for television,

2490
01:08:05,981 --> 01:08:06,580
but it's not,

2491
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:10,930
they don't have the like basically
8,000 year history of that we have,

2492
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:15,590
are they coming from the catskills and
it being like a thing that has different

2493
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:16,424
genres.

2494
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:16,761
You know what I mean?

2495
01:08:16,761 --> 01:08:17,020
It's,

2496
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:17,380
it's,

2497
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:19,610
it's newer in boys invented here.

2498
01:08:19,670 --> 01:08:21,350
It's totally ultimately invented here.

2499
01:08:21,351 --> 01:08:26,090
But there's a lot of confusion or a lot
of questionings as far as who invented

2500
01:08:26,091 --> 01:08:26,181
it.

2501
01:08:26,181 --> 01:08:26,361
I mean,

2502
01:08:26,361 --> 01:08:27,410
who the fuck invented it?

2503
01:08:27,950 --> 01:08:32,360
Is there anyone who is known
as the godfather of stand up?

2504
01:08:32,390 --> 01:08:32,900
That's a good,

2505
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:37,370
that's a good question because stand up
sort of became standup with lenny bruce

2506
01:08:37,610 --> 01:08:38,840
just before that.

2507
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:43,130
It was like a lot of guys that
would share jokes and they would,

2508
01:08:43,131 --> 01:08:43,430
uh,

2509
01:08:43,430 --> 01:08:47,420
they would do the same sketch
for 20 years and you know,

2510
01:08:47,421 --> 01:08:47,581
they,

2511
01:08:47,581 --> 01:08:48,020
they,

2512
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:52,040
they would go perform in the cat skills
and they would all steal each other's

2513
01:08:52,041 --> 01:08:53,030
material and shit.

2514
01:08:53,210 --> 01:08:53,750
They were like,

2515
01:08:53,750 --> 01:08:57,680
people in show business almost like you
would think of a contract studio person

2516
01:08:57,681 --> 01:08:59,690
from like the 19 forties and fifties,

2517
01:08:59,870 --> 01:09:00,141
you know,

2518
01:09:00,141 --> 01:09:02,810
you think of those people
that have contracts with
the studio and did all those

2519
01:09:02,811 --> 01:09:03,644
studio movies.

2520
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:04,251
Well,

2521
01:09:04,251 --> 01:09:05,300
these guys kind of were,

2522
01:09:05,301 --> 01:09:05,780
that,

2523
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:06,380
there were like,

2524
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:07,970
it was a different kind of comedy.

2525
01:09:08,390 --> 01:09:11,540
And then Lenny Bruce came along and all
of a sudden he starts talking about real

2526
01:09:11,541 --> 01:09:12,340
shit.

2527
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:12,590
Yeah.

2528
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:13,351
And all of a sudden you start,

2529
01:09:13,351 --> 01:09:13,701
it's like,

2530
01:09:13,701 --> 01:09:14,071
you know,

2531
01:09:14,071 --> 01:09:17,780
like breaking down our use of language
and why do we have to say this?

2532
01:09:17,781 --> 01:09:20,490
And who's talking about real
scenarios in the home and,

2533
01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:21,081
and like,

2534
01:09:21,081 --> 01:09:21,650
Whoa,

2535
01:09:21,650 --> 01:09:22,740
like that was,

2536
01:09:23,380 --> 01:09:24,213
you know,

2537
01:09:24,590 --> 01:09:25,490
like if you go over my house,

2538
01:09:25,491 --> 01:09:28,290
there's all these lenny bruce posters
everywhere and it's not like I listened to

2539
01:09:28,310 --> 01:09:29,900
Lenny Bruce a lot.

2540
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:31,220
I mean I've certainly have.

2541
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:34,010
It's not like it even holds up to
this day because it really doesn't.

2542
01:09:34,430 --> 01:09:36,800
It's really hard to laugh
at Lenny Bruce's stuff.

2543
01:09:36,801 --> 01:09:40,220
It's hard to put yourself
into that mindset of the
people that lived during the

2544
01:09:40,221 --> 01:09:41,710
19 fifties in the 19 sixties.

2545
01:09:41,750 --> 01:09:42,980
But if you could,

2546
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:47,600
if you could go back in time
and you would be below in a way,

2547
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:48,830
I'm sure of it.

2548
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:54,100
I'm sure his point of view was probably
so incredibly unique at the time and his

2549
01:09:55,131 --> 01:09:55,964
insight,

2550
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:56,570
you know,

2551
01:09:56,570 --> 01:09:57,530
his jokes,

2552
01:09:57,770 --> 01:10:00,590
some of his jokes today are great jokes.

2553
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:03,980
He had this joke about
homosexuality being illegal.

2554
01:10:04,310 --> 01:10:07,700
So what they do is they arrest you and
they put you in jail with a bunch of men

2555
01:10:07,701 --> 01:10:08,600
who want to have sex with you.

2556
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:09,260
Yeah.

2557
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:10,010
You know,

2558
01:10:10,010 --> 01:10:10,600
it was,

2559
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:11,610
it's a good job.

2560
01:10:11,990 --> 01:10:12,381
I mean,

2561
01:10:12,381 --> 01:10:12,650
it's,

2562
01:10:12,650 --> 01:10:13,250
it's,

2563
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:17,540
it's funny in 2013 and he probably
told that in the fifties it's crazy,

2564
01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:18,350
but people were like,

2565
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:18,890
what?

2566
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:20,090
I'd never heard anything like,

2567
01:10:20,570 --> 01:10:21,440
did he just say,

2568
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:22,010
yeah,

2569
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:22,843
yeah.

2570
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:23,360
I mean,

2571
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,310
Lenny Bruce went to jail for it.

2572
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,310
He went to jail for using bad words.

2573
01:10:28,311 --> 01:10:28,700
Like,

2574
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:29,780
people don't understand that.

2575
01:10:29,781 --> 01:10:32,840
That is in this past century.

2576
01:10:33,110 --> 01:10:37,790
People have been locked into
cages for saying naughty words,

2577
01:10:37,850 --> 01:10:38,840
not even threatening.

2578
01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:41,890
Not like saying I'm going to
blow up this plane and not,

2579
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:42,330
not,

2580
01:10:42,330 --> 01:10:42,620
you know,

2581
01:10:42,620 --> 01:10:43,490
words like that,

2582
01:10:43,491 --> 01:10:48,430
but a word like fuck or shit or tickets
or something like that document.

2583
01:10:48,470 --> 01:10:49,580
You're going to jail now.

2584
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:50,750
They drained his money,

2585
01:10:50,751 --> 01:10:51,740
ruined his career.

2586
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:52,880
Jesus.

2587
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:53,390
Yeah.

2588
01:10:53,390 --> 01:10:54,320
That in the smack.

2589
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:56,280
That was the other thing we need
to learn from guys like lenny,

2590
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:58,460
don't stay aware from my friend.

2591
01:10:59,690 --> 01:11:01,850
It seems like nobody
gets through this Mac.

2592
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:02,240
Okay.

2593
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:03,080
Nobody does.

2594
01:11:03,230 --> 01:11:04,460
There's no recovery from that.

2595
01:11:04,730 --> 01:11:06,320
I had a buddy who had
a hard time kicking it.

2596
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:07,251
He,

2597
01:11:07,251 --> 01:11:07,610
um,

2598
01:11:07,610 --> 01:11:08,000
uh,

2599
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:08,870
in a pill form.

2600
01:11:08,930 --> 01:11:10,750
He hurt his back and uh,

2601
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:12,260
the doctors immediately,

2602
01:11:12,261 --> 01:11:16,710
of course gave them heroin
or Oxycontin says oxycontin.

2603
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:17,671
And he was like,

2604
01:11:17,671 --> 01:11:18,091
dude,

2605
01:11:18,091 --> 01:11:18,421
he goes,

2606
01:11:18,421 --> 01:11:18,660
it was,

2607
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:19,920
it was magical.

2608
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:20,341
He goes,

2609
01:11:20,341 --> 01:11:21,030
a cured,

2610
01:11:21,030 --> 01:11:21,960
cured all the pain.

2611
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:22,761
He goes,

2612
01:11:22,761 --> 01:11:22,930
uh,

2613
01:11:22,930 --> 01:11:23,340
I didn't.

2614
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:25,470
It wasn't even that fucked
up when he was on it.

2615
01:11:25,471 --> 01:11:25,890
He was,

2616
01:11:25,890 --> 01:11:26,370
he goes,

2617
01:11:26,370 --> 01:11:27,270
I was just a.

2618
01:11:27,570 --> 01:11:27,991
He goes,

2619
01:11:27,991 --> 01:11:29,130
it just stopped the pain,

2620
01:11:29,740 --> 01:11:30,573
you know.

2621
01:11:31,230 --> 01:11:33,210
But then coming off of it,

2622
01:11:33,211 --> 01:11:35,160
he had to take some other drug.

2623
01:11:35,430 --> 01:11:36,450
It's my friend Tommy Jr,

2624
01:11:36,830 --> 01:11:37,740
if he's listening right now,

2625
01:11:37,770 --> 01:11:38,700
profit Tommy Junior.

2626
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:39,840
Uh,

2627
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:42,240
and they just give them to you man,

2628
01:11:42,270 --> 01:11:43,230
when you get hurt.

2629
01:11:43,290 --> 01:11:47,520
Like I know guys who were junkies
and went to the doctor and you know,

2630
01:11:47,521 --> 01:11:49,370
they give them pain
medication and you know,

2631
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:50,610
that's dangerous trip.

2632
01:11:50,870 --> 01:11:52,140
Like you're getting high,

2633
01:11:52,170 --> 01:11:52,940
like mark,

2634
01:11:52,940 --> 01:11:54,600
mark it down because here it comes,

2635
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:55,310
you know?

2636
01:11:55,310 --> 01:11:56,670
Do you like being sober?

2637
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:57,810
You like keeping your shit together?

2638
01:11:57,990 --> 01:11:58,920
Don't take that.

2639
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:00,720
That's no Bueno.

2640
01:12:00,910 --> 01:12:01,250
Know.

2641
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:03,650
And you take that pill to
the painkillers with a beer.

2642
01:12:03,730 --> 01:12:04,010
Yeah.

2643
01:12:04,010 --> 01:12:04,280
Ooh,

2644
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:05,113
it's,

2645
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:05,970
Oh my God.

2646
01:12:05,970 --> 01:12:06,620
Other ballgame.

2647
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:07,453
Most people do.

2648
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:08,320
Yeah,

2649
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:10,260
like super common of course,

2650
01:12:10,261 --> 01:12:11,180
but not supposed to.

2651
01:12:11,190 --> 01:12:11,600
Right,

2652
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:12,260
right.

2653
01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:12,590
Really?

2654
01:12:12,590 --> 01:12:15,020
Isn't Xanax a really bad
one to take with alcohol?

2655
01:12:15,070 --> 01:12:15,770
Yeah.

2656
01:12:15,770 --> 01:12:18,860
I saw a lady do it on a plane
and she was laughing about it.

2657
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:20,120
She's like,

2658
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:21,110
you didn't know

2659
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:25,420
just a glass of my want glass of
wine and my Xanax and I'm good to go.

2660
01:12:25,421 --> 01:12:26,530
And she was like laughing.

2661
01:12:27,310 --> 01:12:28,810
She puts her fucking goggles on.

2662
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:30,620
Sorry.

2663
01:12:30,620 --> 01:12:31,453
Later.

2664
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:32,890
Rule it on the chair.

2665
01:12:33,250 --> 01:12:33,461
She.

2666
01:12:33,461 --> 01:12:33,880
Yeah,

2667
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:35,950
she was letting everybody
know she was abusing drugs.

2668
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:36,873
Yeah.

2669
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:38,560
But if I let them know,

2670
01:12:38,561 --> 01:12:38,921
if I said,

2671
01:12:38,921 --> 01:12:39,191
listen,

2672
01:12:39,191 --> 01:12:41,320
I took a pot cookie an
hour before this flight.

2673
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:42,670
I'm out of my fucking head.

2674
01:12:42,671 --> 01:12:44,020
Right back the gate guys.

2675
01:12:44,050 --> 01:12:44,321
Yeah.

2676
01:12:44,321 --> 01:12:46,330
We're going to turn this thing
around and landed in the desert.

2677
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:47,200
Yeah.

2678
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:50,100
This a fucking criminal
monster off of our to us whole.

2679
01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:51,070
What were you thinking about?

2680
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:53,470
Just thinking about finger
girls in high school,

2681
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:55,390
what was that all about?

2682
01:12:57,410 --> 01:13:00,370
Just having a flashback to the excitement.

2683
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:02,140
The first time we touched a moist vagina,

2684
01:13:02,141 --> 01:13:02,821
like holy Shit.

2685
01:13:02,821 --> 01:13:06,520
I mean girls that would grab
your Dick and some girls.

2686
01:13:06,521 --> 01:13:09,520
Wouldn't you have those girls that
like everyone would pass around?

2687
01:13:09,521 --> 01:13:10,301
Like during movies,

2688
01:13:10,301 --> 01:13:12,140
like when you had the
projectors out and they like,

2689
01:13:12,340 --> 01:13:14,140
oh we got to some girls.

2690
01:13:14,141 --> 01:13:14,830
Yeah.

2691
01:13:14,830 --> 01:13:16,570
There was some girls that would
just let it do its finger on.

2692
01:13:17,290 --> 01:13:17,990
Yeah,

2693
01:13:17,990 --> 01:13:18,840
that's a good thing.

2694
01:13:20,180 --> 01:13:21,540
You need your posting things balanced.

2695
01:13:21,580 --> 01:13:21,820
This

2696
01:13:21,820 --> 01:13:22,653
universe,

2697
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:23,440
you know,

2698
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:26,620
and it's not necessarily a good thing
that those girls are so needy that they're

2699
01:13:26,621 --> 01:13:27,454
doing that.

2700
01:13:27,460 --> 01:13:29,710
But there's a cause and
effect and it's not her fault.

2701
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:30,280
You know,

2702
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:34,180
that's what people have to realize
whenever girls do like really overreaching

2703
01:13:34,181 --> 01:13:35,200
things to get attention,

2704
01:13:35,330 --> 01:13:36,880
it's because they didn't
get enough attention.

2705
01:13:37,030 --> 01:13:37,361
You know,

2706
01:13:37,361 --> 01:13:38,141
it's really that simple.

2707
01:13:38,141 --> 01:13:39,860
Or they have the wrong
kind of attention there.

2708
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:42,070
They got fucked up and
it's not their fault man.

2709
01:13:42,430 --> 01:13:42,731
You know?

2710
01:13:42,731 --> 01:13:43,060
And that's,

2711
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:44,980
that's something that takes
a long time to figure it out.

2712
01:13:44,981 --> 01:13:47,170
You don't realize that from what I mean,

2713
01:13:47,171 --> 01:13:49,600
people just sort of judge
people by what they see.

2714
01:13:49,780 --> 01:13:52,630
And that's one of the more interesting
things about having children as you start

2715
01:13:52,631 --> 01:13:55,480
judging people by how
they became that thing.

2716
01:13:55,860 --> 01:13:56,960
How did you get to be this,

2717
01:13:56,980 --> 01:13:58,210
this angry,

2718
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:00,630
like really deceptive,

2719
01:14:00,910 --> 01:14:01,270
you know,

2720
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:01,691
shitty,

2721
01:14:01,691 --> 01:14:05,830
selfish person who's ruining lives and
stealing from people and how does the

2722
01:14:05,831 --> 01:14:07,150
person get to be a murderer?

2723
01:14:07,150 --> 01:14:08,560
Has a person get to be a robber,

2724
01:14:08,590 --> 01:14:10,850
breaks into people's houses when you
know they're not going to be around.

2725
01:14:10,851 --> 01:14:13,030
And how do you get to be that person?

2726
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:13,541
Well,

2727
01:14:13,541 --> 01:14:15,610
some a bunch of shit asked to go wrong.

2728
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:17,660
You know there's a bunch
of people have to fail you,

2729
01:14:17,690 --> 01:14:18,120
you know,

2730
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:18,211
you,

2731
01:14:18,211 --> 01:14:20,230
you started off nothing but potential.

2732
01:14:20,350 --> 01:14:21,310
That's what a person is.

2733
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:26,290
Nothing but potential and that is the
number one thing that we don't pay

2734
01:14:26,291 --> 01:14:29,590
attention to and it's the number one
thing that's fucking up this world is that

2735
01:14:29,591 --> 01:14:34,030
people are raised by people that don't
have any idea how to raise the most

2736
01:14:34,031 --> 01:14:36,280
complex thing ever.

2737
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:38,030
A developing human being.

2738
01:14:38,031 --> 01:14:39,490
It's the most complex thing we know of.

2739
01:14:39,491 --> 01:14:44,020
It's a thing that literally can create
an atomic bomb that can blow up the

2740
01:14:44,021 --> 01:14:44,854
fucking world.

2741
01:14:45,010 --> 01:14:45,700
That's how.

2742
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:49,930
That's how powerful the human mind
is and you're leaving it to assholes.

2743
01:14:50,260 --> 01:14:54,400
You're leaving it to a bunch of people
that have no idea how to raise a person

2744
01:14:54,401 --> 01:14:56,450
correctly and weren't
raised correctly themselves,

2745
01:14:56,451 --> 01:14:59,410
so I have all sorts of baggage
that they're carrying into this,

2746
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:03,980
this relationship between mother and
daughter and father and son and the,

2747
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:04,833
you know,

2748
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:10,200
most people have no idea how the fuck
they got into the place that we're at

2749
01:15:10,631 --> 01:15:11,230
right now.

2750
01:15:11,230 --> 01:15:12,940
They live their life on momentum.

2751
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:13,840
You know,

2752
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:17,260
and raising a human when you're stuck
and momentum and screaming at people at

2753
01:15:17,261 --> 01:15:21,630
traffic and calling your wife a current
and kicking your dog and now you've got

2754
01:15:21,631 --> 01:15:22,210
a baby.

2755
01:15:22,210 --> 01:15:22,870
You okay,

2756
01:15:22,870 --> 01:15:23,980
this guy has a baby.

2757
01:15:24,310 --> 01:15:24,940
All right,

2758
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:29,890
now what happens now this baby's fucked
and he's being raised by a shithead and

2759
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:32,950
that's most of what's
going on in the world.

2760
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:38,340
Most of the problems is a
lack of compassion and a
lack of compassion from birth

2761
01:15:39,970 --> 01:15:44,500
to adulthood and it's so common
and it's not being addressed.

2762
01:15:44,530 --> 01:15:45,400
Nobody talks about it.

2763
01:15:45,401 --> 01:15:46,810
Everybody wants to talk about oil.

2764
01:15:46,990 --> 01:15:47,880
Everybody wants to auto.

2765
01:15:47,890 --> 01:15:49,150
What do we do when we run out of oil?

2766
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:53,740
What will we do when peak oil becomes a
problem in this country when we step up

2767
01:15:53,741 --> 01:15:54,370
and learn,

2768
01:15:54,370 --> 01:15:57,700
but nobody looks at the number one
commodity that humans have to offer.

2769
01:15:57,940 --> 01:16:02,940
That's humans are best commodity as
humans and the more potential that you can

2770
01:16:03,971 --> 01:16:05,920
have in that commodity,

2771
01:16:06,130 --> 01:16:09,070
the more the better the
world would be for everybody.

2772
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:12,160
But the problem is that the people that
have billions of dollars are a bunch of

2773
01:16:12,161 --> 01:16:17,161
cons and they want to hold onto that
money with their greasy old moisturizing

2774
01:16:18,461 --> 01:16:22,990
cream fucking leather hands
because they've had it
their whole life and they've

2775
01:16:22,991 --> 01:16:25,540
been in this position of privilege and
they understand what it takes to make

2776
01:16:25,541 --> 01:16:26,710
$16,000,000,000.

2777
01:16:26,850 --> 01:16:27,190
You know,

2778
01:16:27,190 --> 01:16:28,060
when people.

2779
01:16:28,061 --> 01:16:29,140
I had a payoff,

2780
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:29,491
you know,

2781
01:16:29,491 --> 01:16:30,470
I'm a lobbyist.

2782
01:16:30,471 --> 01:16:31,410
I had a bride,

2783
01:16:31,780 --> 01:16:33,400
him just fucking boat,

2784
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:34,353
you know,

2785
01:16:34,870 --> 01:16:37,210
but that's the,

2786
01:16:37,290 --> 01:16:37,540
the,

2787
01:16:37,540 --> 01:16:39,460
the extreme form of,

2788
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:39,880
uh,

2789
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:40,310
you know,

2790
01:16:40,310 --> 01:16:40,540
the,

2791
01:16:40,540 --> 01:16:44,590
the wrong parts of the
competitive aspects of capitalism.

2792
01:16:44,950 --> 01:16:46,430
Do you see Uc Riverside?

2793
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:46,961
No.

2794
01:16:46,961 --> 01:16:47,530
What is that?

2795
01:16:47,530 --> 01:16:48,580
Oh my God,

2796
01:16:48,581 --> 01:16:49,050
what is it?

2797
01:16:49,050 --> 01:16:49,861
It's a documentary.

2798
01:16:49,861 --> 01:16:50,950
It's so fucking.

2799
01:16:50,990 --> 01:16:52,140
You're not the first person to say,

2800
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:53,013
what is it about?

2801
01:16:53,020 --> 01:16:55,430
It's about the guy who,

2802
01:16:55,610 --> 01:16:56,060
um,

2803
01:16:56,060 --> 01:16:56,930
he started.

2804
01:16:57,200 --> 01:17:00,740
It's the world's biggest
time shareholder company.

2805
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:01,610
Westgate,

2806
01:17:01,610 --> 01:17:02,241
I think it's called,

2807
01:17:02,241 --> 01:17:02,751
or it was called,

2808
01:17:02,751 --> 01:17:04,310
something like that I think is westgate.

2809
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:05,031
Anyways,

2810
01:17:05,031 --> 01:17:10,031
a few years ago he went about building
the home in the United States.

2811
01:17:11,470 --> 01:17:12,303
Oh God.

2812
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:14,750
It was 90,000 square feet I think.

2813
01:17:14,860 --> 01:17:15,440
Okay.

2814
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:19,610
Ninety thousand square feet and
it was modeled after Versailles,

2815
01:17:19,970 --> 01:17:21,770
the palace and France.

2816
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:27,100
And he just so happened to be doing this
and a documentary crew was filming him,

2817
01:17:27,850 --> 01:17:28,280
you know,

2818
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:29,240
for this purpose.

2819
01:17:29,540 --> 01:17:32,690
And it happened in [inaudible]
eight when the market crashed,

2820
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:33,890
they had a lion.

2821
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:37,140
This is phenomenal.

2822
01:17:41,070 --> 01:17:45,260
Forty three year old mother of 8:00.

2823
01:17:45,410 --> 01:17:47,290
Choose most beautiful girl in the world.

2824
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:50,290
It took me a while to
fall in love with him.

2825
01:17:51,580 --> 01:17:52,600
We have a great relationship.

2826
01:17:53,290 --> 01:17:54,760
There's 30 years between us,

2827
01:17:54,970 --> 01:17:57,970
but he doesn't need at
least there is that option.

2828
01:17:57,971 --> 01:17:58,804
If he does,

2829
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:00,280
I don't know if 10 years from now

2830
01:18:03,140 --> 01:18:06,130
we never sought out to build
the biggest house in America.

2831
01:18:06,490 --> 01:18:07,630
It just kinda happened.

2832
01:18:07,631 --> 01:18:09,040
It's bigger than the White House.

2833
01:18:09,190 --> 01:18:10,130
Two tennis courts,

2834
01:18:11,090 --> 01:18:12,310
full size baseball field,

2835
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:13,030
kitchen,

2836
01:18:13,030 --> 01:18:13,900
antique furniture,

2837
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:14,980
thousand square feet.

2838
01:18:15,340 --> 01:18:15,731
I'm like,

2839
01:18:15,731 --> 01:18:16,470
God,

2840
01:18:16,470 --> 01:18:16,800
no.

2841
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:17,680
This is my room.

2842
01:18:18,130 --> 01:18:19,000
That's my closet.

2843
01:18:20,650 --> 01:18:22,630
Nothing's really normal about this life

2844
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:28,080
in line to do a billion
dollars in sales for the year.

2845
01:18:28,290 --> 01:18:29,430
We're on top of the world

2846
01:18:31,380 --> 01:18:33,060
and it came to a screeching halt.

2847
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:36,180
The market fell over 700 points.

2848
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:40,550
I would say it's touch and go
right now we don't talk about

2849
01:18:40,630 --> 01:18:41,650
financial problems.

2850
01:18:41,890 --> 01:18:45,970
I guess I'll have to watch the movie
to find out what's going on in my life.

2851
01:18:48,410 --> 01:18:49,280
Everything changes.

2852
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:52,190
This is almost like a
riches to rags story.

2853
01:18:52,370 --> 01:18:54,050
She knows we need to cut back,

2854
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:55,880
but she's still compulsive.

2855
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:00,290
All they could afford a watch.

2856
01:19:00,291 --> 01:19:01,124
I would tell you

2857
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:06,890
our problem is vegas.

2858
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:10,250
Our lenders are made it very clear that
you will have more money than he knows

2859
01:19:10,251 --> 01:19:11,180
what to do with human.

2860
01:19:11,181 --> 01:19:12,260
Go back to building this house.

2861
01:19:12,290 --> 01:19:15,020
If the turns over this
building over my dead body,

2862
01:19:17,410 --> 01:19:21,500
you can buy the palace that timeshare
mogul David Siegel already wants to sell.

2863
01:19:21,530 --> 01:19:22,363
Just think of the brace side.

2864
01:19:22,790 --> 01:19:23,623
You may not have.

2865
01:19:24,590 --> 01:19:25,423
The

2866
01:19:26,690 --> 01:19:31,550
American dream is raising way up above
what you started with and that is what

2867
01:19:31,551 --> 01:19:35,630
she has done when you're down is when
you found out who your true friends are.

2868
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:37,460
You get strength from your marriage.

2869
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:40,673
No,

2870
01:19:41,060 --> 01:19:42,520
I'm in this fantasy world,

2871
01:19:42,540 --> 01:19:43,373
you know,

2872
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:50,610
she is completely oblivious
to how she should come.

2873
01:19:50,611 --> 01:19:50,860
Comes

2874
01:19:50,860 --> 01:19:51,100
off.

2875
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:51,311
Well,

2876
01:19:51,311 --> 01:19:53,590
when they start having to make cutbacks,

2877
01:19:53,650 --> 01:19:54,100
yeah,

2878
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:58,330
there are cut backs or things like we're
not flying private or flying commercial

2879
01:19:58,750 --> 01:20:02,770
and like she picks up like one of her
kids they land and that she picks up her

2880
01:20:02,771 --> 01:20:04,000
kid at the airport and she's like,

2881
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:04,870
what's that?

2882
01:20:04,870 --> 01:20:06,220
What do you think of flying commercial?

2883
01:20:06,250 --> 01:20:06,941
Was that crazy?

2884
01:20:06,941 --> 01:20:07,774
And the kids like,

2885
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:10,440
I don't even know you're talking
about like you're just planes,

2886
01:20:10,441 --> 01:20:10,681
right?

2887
01:20:10,681 --> 01:20:11,430
She's like,

2888
01:20:11,430 --> 01:20:11,641
yeah,

2889
01:20:11,641 --> 01:20:12,340
commercial.

2890
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:16,560
They go to rent a car to visit her
friend at the airport and they're like,

2891
01:20:16,561 --> 01:20:17,250
it hurts.

2892
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:17,911
And then she's like,

2893
01:20:17,911 --> 01:20:21,300
so will the driver like meet me
out front or how does this work?

2894
01:20:21,330 --> 01:20:22,050
And he's like,

2895
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:23,370
this is hertz rent a car.

2896
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:24,653
She's like,

2897
01:20:24,690 --> 01:20:25,201
what is that?

2898
01:20:25,201 --> 01:20:26,220
Like there's no driver.

2899
01:20:26,221 --> 01:20:27,054
And he's like,

2900
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:27,361
no,

2901
01:20:27,361 --> 01:20:28,194
you're the driver.

2902
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:29,400
You're renting a car right now.

2903
01:20:29,820 --> 01:20:30,181
She's like,

2904
01:20:30,181 --> 01:20:30,690
okay.

2905
01:20:30,690 --> 01:20:31,141
I just,

2906
01:20:31,141 --> 01:20:31,960
I don't know.

2907
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:32,540
All right.

2908
01:20:32,540 --> 01:20:33,680
Flow like that.

2909
01:20:33,830 --> 01:20:37,160
That's pretty removed
from society where she's,

2910
01:20:37,460 --> 01:20:39,200
she's living in such a fantasy world.

2911
01:20:39,350 --> 01:20:40,820
How much money to homeboy lose?

2912
01:20:41,630 --> 01:20:43,940
I mean nine figures for sure.

2913
01:20:44,540 --> 01:20:45,373
For sure.

2914
01:20:45,470 --> 01:20:46,040
Yeah.

2915
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:48,800
But he's been a $100,000,000,

2916
01:20:48,950 --> 01:20:50,360
so over 100 million for sure.

2917
01:20:50,410 --> 01:20:50,570
Of,

2918
01:20:50,570 --> 01:20:51,470
of personal lap.

2919
01:20:51,471 --> 01:20:54,350
And think about that nine figure.

2920
01:20:56,070 --> 01:20:56,903
Yeah.

2921
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:57,141
Yeah.

2922
01:20:57,141 --> 01:20:59,450
He lost a substantial amount of money.

2923
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:00,080
Oh my God.

2924
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:01,170
And then you know,

2925
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:02,420
because of properties basically.

2926
01:21:02,450 --> 01:21:07,450
Basically what happened was his business
is a luxury business but it's a luxury

2927
01:21:08,811 --> 01:21:09,740
for the middle class.

2928
01:21:09,980 --> 01:21:13,370
So timeshares or something where
it's like if you have a good job,

2929
01:21:13,371 --> 01:21:15,260
like you know you can
more than pay your bills.

2930
01:21:15,261 --> 01:21:16,880
You can afford to do something.

2931
01:21:16,881 --> 01:21:19,040
Like let's go to Disney world this year,

2932
01:21:19,041 --> 01:21:20,060
let's go to Vegas.

2933
01:21:20,420 --> 01:21:24,770
But they sell you on whether you can
afford to do this and it's people who have

2934
01:21:24,771 --> 01:21:25,300
that,

2935
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:25,790
you know,

2936
01:21:25,790 --> 01:21:26,421
extra money,

2937
01:21:26,421 --> 01:21:28,120
some disposable income but not like.

2938
01:21:28,430 --> 01:21:29,420
So what does it mean?

2939
01:21:29,421 --> 01:21:30,770
What does it mean when
you have a timeshare?

2940
01:21:30,820 --> 01:21:33,300
Was I mean like you have this
month and I have that money.

2941
01:21:33,330 --> 01:21:34,430
It's exactly like that.

2942
01:21:34,431 --> 01:21:36,910
It's like you get to come
to this awesome timeshare,

2943
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:39,200
whichever way you like Vegas,

2944
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:44,120
you have the timeshare in Vegas and two
weeks out of every year maybe you get to

2945
01:21:44,121 --> 01:21:46,490
pick your month if you pay more
or sometime during the year,

2946
01:21:46,491 --> 01:21:47,450
less savory July.

2947
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:49,100
You get your vegas place,

2948
01:21:49,130 --> 01:21:51,770
it's yours and it's fully
furnished and it's awesome.

2949
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:53,180
But other people have the keys to it.

2950
01:21:53,510 --> 01:21:54,110
Yes.

2951
01:21:54,110 --> 01:21:54,361
Yes.

2952
01:21:54,361 --> 01:21:54,830
So it's not.

2953
01:21:54,830 --> 01:21:55,770
Who are the other people though?

2954
01:21:55,910 --> 01:21:58,700
People who like you
signed up for the service.

2955
01:21:58,930 --> 01:21:59,051
Yeah,

2956
01:21:59,051 --> 01:22:00,370
like your friends know.

2957
01:22:00,670 --> 01:22:00,820
No,

2958
01:22:00,820 --> 01:22:01,660
it's total strangers.

2959
01:22:01,661 --> 01:22:02,220
See?

2960
01:22:02,220 --> 01:22:02,820
Yeah,

2961
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:04,000
but there is a property.

2962
01:22:04,350 --> 01:22:09,350
There's a property manager that's on
site for you and then you have to go

2963
01:22:09,551 --> 01:22:14,551
through him that you're basically tell
them if you're paying to go back to the

2964
01:22:14,831 --> 01:22:15,680
same place,

2965
01:22:15,681 --> 01:22:16,390
then ambulance,

2966
01:22:16,390 --> 01:22:17,223
this is my shit,

2967
01:22:17,510 --> 01:22:18,400
but you know it's not,

2968
01:22:18,401 --> 01:22:19,230
but it's not really.

2969
01:22:19,230 --> 01:22:22,510
You don't keep a TV there and
you don't keep stereotype.

2970
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:22,841
I mean,

2971
01:22:22,841 --> 01:22:23,440
it's probably,

2972
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:24,850
I'm sure furnished with all that stuff,

2973
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:28,420
but what happened was probably for a lot
of people more comfortable than going

2974
01:22:28,421 --> 01:22:29,530
on a hotel definitely.

2975
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:30,480
And probably better.

2976
01:22:30,481 --> 01:22:31,530
Like if you can eat my felonies,

2977
01:22:31,540 --> 01:22:31,990
do it all.

2978
01:22:31,990 --> 01:22:35,590
That's the thing is that go
to a supermarket and shop
like you're at home and

2979
01:22:35,591 --> 01:22:36,360
you can get a,

2980
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:40,960
a way higher end place than you would
if you were renting the equivalent at a

2981
01:22:40,961 --> 01:22:41,794
hotel.

2982
01:22:42,010 --> 01:22:44,020
You're not going to get
like a three bedroom suite,

2983
01:22:44,021 --> 01:22:45,640
like you're going to
get at your timeshare.

2984
01:22:46,490 --> 01:22:48,490
But how much do you have to pay here?

2985
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:49,090
I don't know.

2986
01:22:49,090 --> 01:22:49,400
I don't know.

2987
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:50,350
There's not that much.

2988
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:50,801
Uh,

2989
01:22:50,801 --> 01:22:52,090
it's probably,

2990
01:22:52,740 --> 01:22:54,800
it's like the one I went to a,

2991
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:59,230
I actually got suckered into doing
one of those timeshare when I was 18.

2992
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:00,790
My stupid roommate,

2993
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:01,661
he was like,

2994
01:23:01,661 --> 01:23:01,871
Hey,

2995
01:23:01,871 --> 01:23:02,830
I want a vacation.

2996
01:23:02,831 --> 01:23:03,280
And I'm like,

2997
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:04,550
oh Brian.

2998
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:06,010
And then we went

2999
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:06,850
to Florida.

3000
01:23:06,910 --> 01:23:07,181
He's like,

3001
01:23:07,181 --> 01:23:08,860
well we have to do is
find a way to Florida.

3002
01:23:08,861 --> 01:23:10,960
And then we have five days in the Bahamas.

3003
01:23:10,961 --> 01:23:11,291
And I'm like,

3004
01:23:11,291 --> 01:23:11,591
fuck.

3005
01:23:11,591 --> 01:23:12,160
Yeah.

3006
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:16,030
So we get there and we had to like fly
and spend her own money to fly to Florida

3007
01:23:16,031 --> 01:23:18,250
or we could have drove
there and then we get there.

3008
01:23:18,251 --> 01:23:22,090
And then like the first day
we checked in to this hotel,

3009
01:23:22,091 --> 01:23:22,751
it was all paid for.

3010
01:23:22,751 --> 01:23:22,991
I was like,

3011
01:23:22,991 --> 01:23:23,824
this is sweet.

3012
01:23:23,910 --> 01:23:24,560
Uh,

3013
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:25,080
he was like,

3014
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:25,301
all right,

3015
01:23:25,301 --> 01:23:27,070
well we got to go to this condo thing.

3016
01:23:27,071 --> 01:23:29,870
We have to just do this little thing
for a couple of parameters seminar.

3017
01:23:30,390 --> 01:23:31,260
And he didn't tell him.

3018
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:34,000
He totally did not tell him that
we had to do this every day.

3019
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:35,860
Like for two hours a day,

3020
01:23:36,090 --> 01:23:37,750
except for like the last two days.

3021
01:23:37,810 --> 01:23:38,980
How many days were you there for?

3022
01:23:38,981 --> 01:23:40,060
I think five days.

3023
01:23:40,450 --> 01:23:43,720
And so every day they just went
to a new level of trying to.

3024
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:45,400
And everyday I would say the same thing.

3025
01:23:45,401 --> 01:23:45,820
I'm like,

3026
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:46,990
I'm 18.

3027
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:47,771
I was like,

3028
01:23:47,771 --> 01:23:49,690
do you really think I can do this?

3029
01:23:49,810 --> 01:23:50,680
I Howard,

3030
01:23:50,830 --> 01:23:52,580
how'd you even give me here everyday?

3031
01:23:52,780 --> 01:23:53,830
What were they saying to you?

3032
01:23:53,860 --> 01:23:55,190
They would show us the condos,

3033
01:23:55,210 --> 01:23:56,410
which they were all amazing,

3034
01:23:56,411 --> 01:23:59,920
but they would walk us around and then
like the next day would go to a different

3035
01:23:59,921 --> 01:24:00,490
part of,

3036
01:24:00,490 --> 01:24:01,840
at the time it was Florida,

3037
01:24:01,841 --> 01:24:02,680
like this is what happened.

3038
01:24:02,700 --> 01:24:04,660
It's like last two days was in Bahamas.

3039
01:24:04,780 --> 01:24:05,800
He didn't tell me that either.

3040
01:24:05,830 --> 01:24:07,270
He's just like five days in Bahamas.

3041
01:24:07,390 --> 01:24:07,960
But what was,

3042
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:08,800
it was in Pompano,

3043
01:24:08,801 --> 01:24:09,880
Florida the whole time.

3044
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:11,200
So he just went to all these different,

3045
01:24:11,201 --> 01:24:11,650
like,

3046
01:24:11,650 --> 01:24:12,280
whoa,

3047
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:14,080
these condo places in Pompano.

3048
01:24:14,260 --> 01:24:14,900
And they were like,

3049
01:24:14,900 --> 01:24:16,750
this is this so-and-so place.

3050
01:24:16,751 --> 01:24:19,030
And I know that was in the Bahamas now,

3051
01:24:19,060 --> 01:24:20,620
not the first three days.

3052
01:24:20,650 --> 01:24:21,780
The last few days

3053
01:24:23,310 --> 01:24:26,410
they take a boat cruise
thing over to the Bahamas.

3054
01:24:27,130 --> 01:24:27,880
Uh,

3055
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:31,930
like three hours to Obama's
on a boat in three hours.

3056
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:32,201
Yeah,

3057
01:24:32,201 --> 01:24:33,100
I think so.

3058
01:24:33,250 --> 01:24:33,640
Yeah.

3059
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:35,200
And so then,

3060
01:24:35,230 --> 01:24:39,130
but what sucked is like every day they
tried to get you to sign this contract.

3061
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:40,030
And it was like fucking,

3062
01:24:40,031 --> 01:24:40,721
like hardcore,

3063
01:24:40,721 --> 01:24:41,410
like they were like,

3064
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:41,770
no,

3065
01:24:41,770 --> 01:24:43,350
you need to sit down here and talk to,

3066
01:24:43,450 --> 01:24:43,950
you know.

3067
01:24:43,950 --> 01:24:44,210
And I'm like,

3068
01:24:44,210 --> 01:24:46,910
look at those young guys
who were the guys that,

3069
01:24:46,911 --> 01:24:47,261
you know,

3070
01:24:47,261 --> 01:24:48,100
these were older,

3071
01:24:48,130 --> 01:24:48,963
older guy,

3072
01:24:49,030 --> 01:24:49,690
you know,

3073
01:24:49,690 --> 01:24:50,590
what were they saying to you?

3074
01:24:50,750 --> 01:24:51,490
They were like,

3075
01:24:51,490 --> 01:24:53,680
do you understand you're
at the perfect age.

3076
01:24:54,100 --> 01:24:55,090
I'm sure your credit,

3077
01:24:55,091 --> 01:24:55,540
you know,

3078
01:24:55,540 --> 01:24:58,440
this will be a good investment in
your life because you can like,

3079
01:24:58,470 --> 01:24:58,750
you know,

3080
01:24:58,750 --> 01:24:59,501
rent this out,

3081
01:24:59,501 --> 01:25:02,530
sub rented out and you will always
have this really cool place,

3082
01:25:02,531 --> 01:25:02,781
you know,

3083
01:25:02,781 --> 01:25:06,820
in the pompanos or whatever
they're telling you that
if you don't use it for the

3084
01:25:06,821 --> 01:25:07,660
weeks that you get it,

3085
01:25:07,661 --> 01:25:08,171
you can rent,

3086
01:25:08,171 --> 01:25:11,170
you can rent it out to other people and
making profit from it so easily it's

3087
01:25:11,171 --> 01:25:12,100
going to cost you this,

3088
01:25:12,101 --> 01:25:12,790
but you could rent it.

3089
01:25:12,790 --> 01:25:13,210
Right?

3090
01:25:13,210 --> 01:25:13,780
Exactly.

3091
01:25:13,780 --> 01:25:14,560
And I wanted to,

3092
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:18,700
I want to say it was probably
something like he paid once,

3093
01:25:18,701 --> 01:25:20,020
like a huge chunk of money.

3094
01:25:20,021 --> 01:25:21,910
Like I want to say it was
like something ridiculous,

3095
01:25:21,911 --> 01:25:26,620
like $10,000 and then every year you
pay like a maintenance fee or something

3096
01:25:26,621 --> 01:25:26,861
like that.

3097
01:25:26,861 --> 01:25:28,180
That's like $200,

3098
01:25:28,181 --> 01:25:29,500
I want to say it's something like that.

3099
01:25:29,650 --> 01:25:31,660
So it's a top heavy sort of thing.

3100
01:25:31,690 --> 01:25:31,900
Yeah,

3101
01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:32,920
definitely top heavy.

3102
01:25:32,950 --> 01:25:33,783
And they were like,

3103
01:25:33,910 --> 01:25:34,511
they were saying like,

3104
01:25:34,511 --> 01:25:34,691
look,

3105
01:25:34,691 --> 01:25:37,570
we have the best financial
solutions we have.

3106
01:25:37,571 --> 01:25:38,404
These are we,

3107
01:25:38,410 --> 01:25:39,850
we are friends with
the people at the bank.

3108
01:25:40,060 --> 01:25:44,090
We will get you the best rate
that we can get you for 20 years,

3109
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:44,953
you know,

3110
01:25:44,970 --> 01:25:45,240
to,

3111
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:49,870
to divide that 10,000 out to probably
$30,000 after finance charges.

3112
01:25:49,871 --> 01:25:50,081
You know,

3113
01:25:50,081 --> 01:25:50,741
it's a scam.

3114
01:25:50,741 --> 01:25:51,550
It's,

3115
01:25:51,550 --> 01:25:52,000
it's,

3116
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:52,660
uh,

3117
01:25:52,660 --> 01:25:53,130
it's,

3118
01:25:53,130 --> 01:25:55,060
it's kind of a bit of A.

3119
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:55,980
I mean it's,

3120
01:25:55,980 --> 01:25:57,070
it's one of those scams.

3121
01:25:57,071 --> 01:25:58,540
It's been around for a long time though.

3122
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:00,460
The high pressure marketing scam,

3123
01:26:00,940 --> 01:26:01,510
you know,

3124
01:26:01,510 --> 01:26:02,920
it's like a legit scam.

3125
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:04,010
Like you're allowed to

3126
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:04,430
do that.

3127
01:26:04,430 --> 01:26:06,350
You're allowed to do that.

3128
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:10,370
That kind of like high pressure shit if
you're like socially awkward or weird,

3129
01:26:10,371 --> 01:26:11,870
you could really crack people with that.

3130
01:26:11,930 --> 01:26:12,660
You know,

3131
01:26:12,660 --> 01:26:13,920
I was just getting really pissed.

3132
01:26:13,980 --> 01:26:18,900
And the other thing you had to pay for
all the tax of all the hotels that we

3133
01:26:18,901 --> 01:26:19,560
stayed at.

3134
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:20,670
So at the end they were like,

3135
01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:20,941
all right,

3136
01:26:20,941 --> 01:26:23,190
you owe $800 in taxes.

3137
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:26,670
So I ended up having to pay
like back then like Ohio days,

3138
01:26:26,940 --> 01:26:27,750
$800.

3139
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:31,770
We both had to pay $400 or something
like that shit load of money that drained

3140
01:26:31,771 --> 01:26:35,430
my bank account and then like
I only had $300 so my room,

3141
01:26:35,460 --> 01:26:38,880
my roommate gave me the extra hundred
and then I never paid him back because I

3142
01:26:38,881 --> 01:26:39,121
was like,

3143
01:26:39,121 --> 01:26:39,540
look dude,

3144
01:26:39,540 --> 01:26:40,470
that was bullshit.

3145
01:26:40,620 --> 01:26:42,810
I'm sorry that you did
not tell me any of this.

3146
01:26:42,811 --> 01:26:44,130
You said we had a free vacation.

3147
01:26:44,131 --> 01:26:44,581
I'm sorry,

3148
01:26:44,581 --> 01:26:45,330
but I didn't eat.

3149
01:26:45,330 --> 01:26:46,710
Made me spend an extra,

3150
01:26:46,850 --> 01:26:47,160
you know,

3151
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:48,510
Blah Blah amount of money.

3152
01:26:48,780 --> 01:26:50,790
And so we stopped talking ever since then.

3153
01:26:50,940 --> 01:26:53,100
And then we became
enemies for a long time.

3154
01:26:53,101 --> 01:26:55,050
And then just because over $100.

3155
01:26:55,590 --> 01:26:57,780
Isn't it funny how
something like that wrong,

3156
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,630
you could just decide
that that person's enemy,

3157
01:27:00,780 --> 01:27:00,991
right?

3158
01:27:00,991 --> 01:27:02,790
Well it was just locked
me out of 100 bucks.

3159
01:27:02,850 --> 01:27:03,810
Bullshit man.

3160
01:27:03,811 --> 01:27:04,644
It was like,

3161
01:27:04,810 --> 01:27:06,510
it's definitely not a vacation.

3162
01:27:06,540 --> 01:27:06,811
Well,

3163
01:27:06,811 --> 01:27:07,130
you know,

3164
01:27:07,130 --> 01:27:07,963
it's also,

3165
01:27:08,010 --> 01:27:08,340
it would,

3166
01:27:08,340 --> 01:27:11,760
they would probably have to pay you a
lot of money to make you sit there and

3167
01:27:11,761 --> 01:27:12,630
listen to those people.

3168
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:13,860
And in the end,

3169
01:27:13,980 --> 01:27:15,000
what you did spend,

3170
01:27:15,030 --> 01:27:19,660
you probably could have done almost the
same thing with your 400 bucks or you

3171
01:27:19,661 --> 01:27:20,160
know,

3172
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:21,800
or whatever the hell
it would have cost me.

3173
01:27:21,810 --> 01:27:25,590
How much can you go to like on the
cheap to the Bahamas for and stay in the

3174
01:27:25,591 --> 01:27:26,820
cheapest place possible.

3175
01:27:26,821 --> 01:27:31,821
I bet you we ended up spending more money
between the two of you both got a two

3176
01:27:32,821 --> 01:27:33,654
bedroom.

3177
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:35,400
The hotels were just like,

3178
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:39,300
that was one thing I said like it's
three and a half or above a hotel.

3179
01:27:40,050 --> 01:27:41,580
It was like very borderline.

3180
01:27:41,581 --> 01:27:43,330
It was like courtyard at the Marriott,

3181
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:43,860
you know what I mean?

3182
01:27:43,860 --> 01:27:44,040
Do.

3183
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:47,400
That's one thing about like uh,

3184
01:27:47,430 --> 01:27:52,050
I think has happened to the older you
get to is like I will not compromise on

3185
01:27:52,051 --> 01:27:52,890
certain shit.

3186
01:27:52,950 --> 01:27:54,440
Like certain paper.

3187
01:27:54,660 --> 01:27:54,931
Well,

3188
01:27:54,931 --> 01:27:55,910
like just certain like,

3189
01:27:55,950 --> 01:27:56,520
like,

3190
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:56,911
hey man,

3191
01:27:56,911 --> 01:27:58,110
do you want to go see this shit?

3192
01:27:58,260 --> 01:28:00,720
And backpack with like eight
people that will see some Austin.

3193
01:28:00,721 --> 01:28:00,901
Like,

3194
01:28:00,901 --> 01:28:01,411
no man,

3195
01:28:01,411 --> 01:28:02,244
I don't want to do that.

3196
01:28:02,410 --> 01:28:03,243
Like if I,

3197
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:07,440
I'm not saying I have to have
four seasons and like I can't,

3198
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:07,920
you know,

3199
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:08,910
afford to do that.

3200
01:28:08,940 --> 01:28:09,773
And I'm not,

3201
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:10,890
I'm like,

3202
01:28:11,190 --> 01:28:13,560
I'm basically not going to
take a trip if I can't do it,

3203
01:28:13,561 --> 01:28:15,630
at least at a level that
I'm comfortable with,

3204
01:28:15,690 --> 01:28:16,523
you know,

3205
01:28:16,940 --> 01:28:19,620
I agree with you most of most of the time.

3206
01:28:19,710 --> 01:28:20,251
But uh,

3207
01:28:20,251 --> 01:28:20,400
I,

3208
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:20,661
you know,

3209
01:28:20,661 --> 01:28:23,970
I went on that show mediator and we've
been camping for five nights in the

3210
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:25,260
Missouri breaks.

3211
01:28:25,350 --> 01:28:26,131
But that's a trip.

3212
01:28:26,131 --> 01:28:28,110
Usury River brain want to do that,

3213
01:28:28,130 --> 01:28:29,340
that you want that experience.

3214
01:28:29,341 --> 01:28:32,250
I'm saying I'm not saying like if
that experience were presented to me,

3215
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:33,930
I would consider that for what it is.

3216
01:28:34,230 --> 01:28:35,940
But I'm not like I met
a dude who was like,

3217
01:28:35,970 --> 01:28:37,080
you haven't been to the Bahamas.

3218
01:28:37,230 --> 01:28:38,250
I went on a mail boat,

3219
01:28:38,310 --> 01:28:43,220
like bringing mail over and like slept
with like basically the mail carrier and

3220
01:28:43,221 --> 01:28:44,160
like the end the letters.

3221
01:28:44,161 --> 01:28:44,611
And I was like,

3222
01:28:44,611 --> 01:28:45,060
Nah,

3223
01:28:45,060 --> 01:28:46,200
you know what the product is that.

3224
01:28:46,230 --> 01:28:46,460
Yeah.

3225
01:28:46,460 --> 01:28:48,560
The problem with that is
though I am the same way,

3226
01:28:48,590 --> 01:28:49,880
but I'm kind of grumpy.

3227
01:28:49,881 --> 01:28:50,270
I'm getting old.

3228
01:28:50,270 --> 01:28:50,950
I'm the older,

3229
01:28:50,950 --> 01:28:51,660
I get it.

3230
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:51,910
But,

3231
01:28:51,910 --> 01:28:52,250
you know,

3232
01:28:52,250 --> 01:28:56,330
I went on this trip to Joshua tree where
we stayed in this like little rv and I

3233
01:28:56,331 --> 01:28:57,164
was so against,

3234
01:28:57,180 --> 01:28:57,381
I'm like,

3235
01:28:57,381 --> 01:28:57,651
look,

3236
01:28:57,651 --> 01:28:57,861
you know,

3237
01:28:57,861 --> 01:28:58,720
I want to go Joshua tree,

3238
01:28:58,730 --> 01:29:01,690
but I don't want to stay in some shitty
rv in the middle of some campground.

3239
01:29:01,710 --> 01:29:03,070
Like what can we just stay somewhere nice?

3240
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:07,140
And I was being a bitch about the whole
thing until we got there and it ended up

3241
01:29:07,141 --> 01:29:08,310
being the coolest adventure ever.

3242
01:29:08,311 --> 01:29:09,390
Like I would never have done it,

3243
01:29:09,550 --> 01:29:09,810
you know,

3244
01:29:09,810 --> 01:29:10,020
like,

3245
01:29:10,020 --> 01:29:14,480
or like I get like this girl I know
wants me to go camping with her and uh,

3246
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:18,420
I'm like doing the same thing where I
know if I go I might have a great fucking

3247
01:29:18,421 --> 01:29:19,254
time.

3248
01:29:20,010 --> 01:29:20,860
I've just been grumpy.

3249
01:29:20,861 --> 01:29:21,541
But that's again,

3250
01:29:21,541 --> 01:29:22,890
like a specific instance

3251
01:29:22,970 --> 01:29:24,170
variance I think though too,

3252
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:24,651
you know what I mean?

3253
01:29:24,651 --> 01:29:29,651
Like it's like it has the group called
the group experience in mind going into

3254
01:29:30,111 --> 01:29:31,640
it is going something like that.

3255
01:29:31,670 --> 01:29:32,061
If you go,

3256
01:29:32,061 --> 01:29:32,780
if somebody goes,

3257
01:29:32,780 --> 01:29:33,201
hey man,

3258
01:29:33,201 --> 01:29:34,460
do you want to go to Paris right now?

3259
01:29:34,461 --> 01:29:35,030
And you're like,

3260
01:29:35,030 --> 01:29:35,391
okay.

3261
01:29:35,391 --> 01:29:35,751
And they're like,

3262
01:29:35,751 --> 01:29:38,210
now we're going to stay at this place.

3263
01:29:38,211 --> 01:29:38,481
Will you,

3264
01:29:38,481 --> 01:29:40,040
will have your own room or bathroom.

3265
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:41,930
But if you get the key
from the front desk,

3266
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:42,381
I'd be like,

3267
01:29:42,381 --> 01:29:42,591
you know,

3268
01:29:42,591 --> 01:29:45,290
I'll wait on Paris for a
little while so that I can,

3269
01:29:45,350 --> 01:29:45,770
you know,

3270
01:29:45,770 --> 01:29:47,360
stay in my own room or something.

3271
01:29:47,361 --> 01:29:48,040
You know what I mean?

3272
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:48,180
Like,

3273
01:29:48,180 --> 01:29:48,810
I'm not,

3274
01:29:48,810 --> 01:29:50,370
I don't want to exactly

3275
01:29:50,730 --> 01:29:51,730
the lack of sleep.

3276
01:29:51,731 --> 01:29:54,730
You're going to get sleep on the dude
because you know he's snoring and you

3277
01:29:54,731 --> 01:29:54,851
know,

3278
01:29:54,851 --> 01:29:56,230
you're snoring is going to wake you up.

3279
01:29:56,550 --> 01:29:58,330
It's going to be a goddamn disaster.

3280
01:29:58,540 --> 01:29:59,860
Last time I slept with a dude,

3281
01:29:59,970 --> 01:30:00,970
it's my friend Gary.

3282
01:30:01,030 --> 01:30:03,610
It was a coming to a ringtone.

3283
01:30:04,210 --> 01:30:07,800
Last time I slept with a dude or
Dudette last time I slept with dude.

3284
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:09,533
Um,

3285
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:10,720
he uh,

3286
01:30:10,750 --> 01:30:12,010
he came to stay with me and he,

3287
01:30:12,011 --> 01:30:12,370
uh,

3288
01:30:12,370 --> 01:30:13,930
he didn't have enough money for a hotel.

3289
01:30:13,931 --> 01:30:16,120
He was out here doing like
some shit from New York.

3290
01:30:16,121 --> 01:30:17,050
He's a comic as well,

3291
01:30:17,230 --> 01:30:17,441
you know,

3292
01:30:17,441 --> 01:30:18,274
Gary Valentine,

3293
01:30:19,290 --> 01:30:20,860
Valentine Kevin's brother.

3294
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:23,320
And this mother fucker.

3295
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:25,900
I never heard anybody
snore like this before.

3296
01:30:26,970 --> 01:30:27,551
It's crazy,

3297
01:30:27,551 --> 01:30:27,761
right?

3298
01:30:27,761 --> 01:30:28,510
It was crazy.

3299
01:30:28,510 --> 01:30:29,021
In the middle of that,

3300
01:30:29,021 --> 01:30:30,070
I had a gap and go,

3301
01:30:30,071 --> 01:30:31,270
are you fucking kidding me?

3302
01:30:31,510 --> 01:30:32,740
But this was when we were kids.

3303
01:30:32,770 --> 01:30:35,050
We were both like in our early twenties,

3304
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:36,520
just like in the early nineties.

3305
01:30:36,620 --> 01:30:40,790
Couple of years ago I stayed at the West
Palm Beach head is a condo and I was

3306
01:30:40,791 --> 01:30:42,920
down there and my buddy
chuck came to town,

3307
01:30:42,950 --> 01:30:45,950
Chuck's 65 to 90 big,

3308
01:30:45,980 --> 01:30:46,813
big dude.

3309
01:30:46,970 --> 01:30:47,720
And he was like,

3310
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:48,111
Yo,

3311
01:30:48,111 --> 01:30:48,861
I'm like,

3312
01:30:48,861 --> 01:30:50,330
can I crash the condo is a,

3313
01:30:50,690 --> 01:30:51,523
has like a,

3314
01:30:51,670 --> 01:30:52,503
you know,

3315
01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:53,080
whatever,

3316
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:54,380
a bedroom and living room.

3317
01:30:54,830 --> 01:30:55,161
I was like,

3318
01:30:55,161 --> 01:30:55,461
yeah,

3319
01:30:55,461 --> 01:30:56,294
he goes,

3320
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:59,420
lays in the bed and like,

3321
01:30:59,421 --> 01:31:02,990
before I even can sit down I hear him,

3322
01:31:03,430 --> 01:31:04,080
uh,

3323
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:06,560
like not just snoring but
he also grinds his teeth.

3324
01:31:06,660 --> 01:31:07,540
Oh my God.

3325
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:11,760
And it sounded like a monster was doing
it because he's such an enormous person.

3326
01:31:12,060 --> 01:31:13,110
I laid on the couch

3327
01:31:13,140 --> 01:31:16,140
in that condo with my
noise canceling headphones,

3328
01:31:17,770 --> 01:31:18,311
a sun,

3329
01:31:18,311 --> 01:31:22,030
like a shirt over my eyes so that like
block it out and a mouth guard in my

3330
01:31:22,031 --> 01:31:22,864
mouth.

3331
01:31:23,950 --> 01:31:25,030
And he came out and he was like,

3332
01:31:25,031 --> 01:31:26,370
what the fuck are you doing?

3333
01:31:26,390 --> 01:31:26,680
Like what?

3334
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:27,050
I'm like,

3335
01:31:27,050 --> 01:31:27,431
if you,

3336
01:31:27,431 --> 01:31:27,701
man,

3337
01:31:27,701 --> 01:31:30,010
you came to visit and now
you've ruined my night.

3338
01:31:30,070 --> 01:31:30,940
That's what happened.

3339
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:34,660
That snoring is grown.

3340
01:31:34,661 --> 01:31:36,330
Like a grinding things to worse.

3341
01:31:36,331 --> 01:31:37,970
That's just scary sounding.

3342
01:31:37,980 --> 01:31:38,191
Yeah.

3343
01:31:38,191 --> 01:31:39,024
It's like,

3344
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:40,960
why do people do that?

3345
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:42,340
They say it's or whatever.

3346
01:31:42,341 --> 01:31:42,520
No,

3347
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:43,360
I'm a clincher.

3348
01:31:43,390 --> 01:31:44,440
Like the dentist said like,

3349
01:31:44,441 --> 01:31:44,591
no,

3350
01:31:44,591 --> 01:31:45,690
that's actually okay.

3351
01:31:45,730 --> 01:31:47,710
You clench and that's why
you have really strong.

3352
01:31:47,780 --> 01:31:50,330
Many of my teeth are
cracked from weightlifting.

3353
01:31:50,750 --> 01:31:51,350
What?

3354
01:31:51,350 --> 01:31:52,010
Yeah.

3355
01:31:52,010 --> 01:31:56,960
Really your teeth are cracked
from Ms Dot some serious weight,

3356
01:31:56,961 --> 01:31:57,380
man.

3357
01:31:57,380 --> 01:31:58,430
I'm a very strong person.

3358
01:31:58,431 --> 01:31:59,264
Yeah,

3359
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:02,683
my man.

3360
01:32:03,340 --> 01:32:03,850
But yeah,

3361
01:32:03,850 --> 01:32:05,500
he told me where a mouth
guard when I lift weights.

3362
01:32:05,890 --> 01:32:06,550
No Shit.

3363
01:32:06,550 --> 01:32:07,270
Yeah,

3364
01:32:07,270 --> 01:32:08,103
it's probably.

3365
01:32:08,170 --> 01:32:11,410
We do like squats years
hitting the bag as well.

3366
01:32:11,700 --> 01:32:13,300
I only hit the bag with the mouthpiece on.

3367
01:32:13,580 --> 01:32:13,990
When do you.

3368
01:32:13,990 --> 01:32:15,280
When you bite down,

3369
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:17,260
you know when you're really
digging into something,

3370
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:20,200
you actually lose a lot of
power if you don't bite down.

3371
01:32:20,201 --> 01:32:21,250
It's really strange.

3372
01:32:21,490 --> 01:32:22,450
I don't understand it.

3373
01:32:22,710 --> 01:32:23,350
I don't really want it.

3374
01:32:23,350 --> 01:32:24,090
Yeah.

3375
01:32:24,090 --> 01:32:24,250
Yeah.

3376
01:32:24,250 --> 01:32:26,770
It doesn't seem like you can hit
his heart when your mouth is open.

3377
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:28,200
It's like your whole body needs.

3378
01:32:28,950 --> 01:32:33,950
It needs to work together as you explode
out on impact and when your mouth is

3379
01:32:34,540 --> 01:32:35,380
open a little.

3380
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:37,330
I think there's a lack of,

3381
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:37,920
uh,

3382
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:38,631
of power to that.

3383
01:32:38,631 --> 01:32:39,580
It's kind of strange,

3384
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:42,610
but it's very difficult
to get full bounty of,

3385
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:43,060
of,

3386
01:32:43,060 --> 01:32:45,880
of power and explosive energy
when you have your mouth open.

3387
01:32:46,270 --> 01:32:50,830
They actually did like tests on it and
I think it was the basis of one of those

3388
01:32:50,831 --> 01:32:51,940
mouth guards they had.

3389
01:32:51,941 --> 01:32:56,230
They had like this power guard where they
proved that like if have a bit down on

3390
01:32:56,231 --> 01:32:56,360
it,

3391
01:32:56,360 --> 01:32:58,900
it actually increased the
amount of weight you can lift.

3392
01:32:59,170 --> 01:32:59,580
Really?

3393
01:32:59,580 --> 01:33:00,130
Yeah.

3394
01:33:00,130 --> 01:33:00,963
Yeah.

3395
01:33:01,210 --> 01:33:05,590
Like they aligned your jaw in a certain
way that increased the amount of power

3396
01:33:05,591 --> 01:33:06,041
that your,

3397
01:33:06,041 --> 01:33:06,874
your body hand.

3398
01:33:07,390 --> 01:33:08,440
I don't understand that.

3399
01:33:08,441 --> 01:33:11,680
I don't know why that would be
the case button for some reason.

3400
01:33:11,980 --> 01:33:13,660
You can't hit his heart
when your mouse open.

3401
01:33:14,090 --> 01:33:14,930
That's really interesting.

3402
01:33:14,931 --> 01:33:15,910
I know like you know,

3403
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:18,320
breathing can affect like how you like,

3404
01:33:19,270 --> 01:33:19,720
yeah,

3405
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:24,110
like holding your breath versus breathing
related to a lot of physical things

3406
01:33:24,330 --> 01:33:25,280
makes a huge difference.

3407
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:26,193
Huge difference.

3408
01:33:26,660 --> 01:33:31,660
And being able to sustain like a an in
and out breath versus like holding your

3409
01:33:31,911 --> 01:33:35,680
breath is one of the biggest
issues in Jujitsu is breathing

3410
01:33:35,870 --> 01:33:36,531
me how to breathe.

3411
01:33:36,531 --> 01:33:36,801
Right.

3412
01:33:36,801 --> 01:33:41,801
And that's why the really the best guys
are all really into yoga and Pranayama

3413
01:33:42,471 --> 01:33:44,660
and learning breathing
techniques and stuff like that.

3414
01:33:44,661 --> 01:33:47,300
Because if you can control
your breath and your,

3415
01:33:47,301 --> 01:33:47,570
your,

3416
01:33:47,570 --> 01:33:50,990
your diaphragm is a muscle
that you can control.

3417
01:33:51,020 --> 01:33:53,180
Much like you can control your arms,

3418
01:33:53,210 --> 01:33:54,043
your legs.

3419
01:33:54,230 --> 01:33:56,230
And there's certain guys like this dude,

3420
01:33:56,280 --> 01:33:58,970
Hixon Gracie is like the
greatest Jujitsu guy ever.

3421
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:03,280
He does all this crazy yoga shit
with his stomach where a stomach in.

3422
01:34:03,281 --> 01:34:04,850
It's really freaky to watch man.

3423
01:34:05,270 --> 01:34:09,230
But the guy has absolute
control of his breathing.

3424
01:34:09,260 --> 01:34:09,891
That's incredible.

3425
01:34:09,891 --> 01:34:10,730
And because of that,

3426
01:34:10,790 --> 01:34:12,110
I mean not just because of that,

3427
01:34:12,111 --> 01:34:14,780
because he's also incredibly talented.

3428
01:34:14,900 --> 01:34:18,890
Just has a wealth of knowledge of Jujitsu.

3429
01:34:18,891 --> 01:34:19,370
He just,

3430
01:34:19,370 --> 01:34:20,160
he's a master,

3431
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:21,350
a true master.

3432
01:34:21,770 --> 01:34:24,440
And on top of that he's also a Yogi.

3433
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:25,260
Yeah.

3434
01:34:25,260 --> 01:34:27,590
Not that breathing shit is like.

3435
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:28,880
It's super important.

3436
01:34:28,881 --> 01:34:31,070
Coordinating your breath
with striking as well,

3437
01:34:31,071 --> 01:34:32,150
not just with the Jujitsu.

3438
01:34:32,450 --> 01:34:33,650
When you kick the bag,

3439
01:34:33,651 --> 01:34:34,490
when you kick a person,

3440
01:34:34,491 --> 01:34:36,380
when you breathe out as you,

3441
01:34:36,381 --> 01:34:37,214
as you strike,

3442
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:38,473
you know,

3443
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:39,361
and that's why.

3444
01:34:39,361 --> 01:34:42,390
And a lot of like the karate and uh,

3445
01:34:42,470 --> 01:34:43,303
even um,

3446
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:44,800
I'm in Moitai,

3447
01:34:44,870 --> 01:34:45,410
they,

3448
01:34:45,410 --> 01:34:45,860
they,

3449
01:34:45,860 --> 01:34:48,290
they like it not like
the same thing that Kia,

3450
01:34:48,830 --> 01:34:50,540
like they yell out when they,

3451
01:34:50,541 --> 01:34:50,750
uh,

3452
01:34:50,750 --> 01:34:55,750
when they hit things and tie guys do that
a lot in training like here and like,

3453
01:34:56,280 --> 01:34:57,020
you know,

3454
01:34:57,020 --> 01:34:59,060
and like in when you go to Thai fights,

3455
01:34:59,061 --> 01:35:01,670
they yell out like the audience
or the trainers yellow,

3456
01:35:03,140 --> 01:35:03,861
the yellow out,

3457
01:35:03,861 --> 01:35:04,694
you know.

3458
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:05,950
And um,

3459
01:35:05,950 --> 01:35:06,760
it's like,

3460
01:35:06,760 --> 01:35:06,950
you know,

3461
01:35:06,950 --> 01:35:11,270
like you're tightening up
as you're delivering the
shot and also to protect you

3462
01:35:11,271 --> 01:35:12,740
a little bit if you get hit yourself.

3463
01:35:12,980 --> 01:35:13,701
I know a lot of the,

3464
01:35:13,701 --> 01:35:13,970
um,

3465
01:35:13,970 --> 01:35:16,980
like the heavy bench press guys with,

3466
01:35:16,990 --> 01:35:18,580
they're trying to wrap
out on heavy weight.

3467
01:35:18,710 --> 01:35:20,480
It's always a one in one out.

3468
01:35:21,590 --> 01:35:25,040
Take one breath in and push
it out with one breath.

3469
01:35:25,480 --> 01:35:27,280
And that's how they try to do like two,

3470
01:35:27,281 --> 01:35:27,831
25,

3471
01:35:27,831 --> 01:35:29,120
like 30 fucking times.

3472
01:35:29,450 --> 01:35:30,410
That shit is like,

3473
01:35:30,470 --> 01:35:31,303
all,

3474
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:31,641
you know,

3475
01:35:31,641 --> 01:35:32,474
it's better than going.

3476
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:37,460
You hold your breath and you're
totally fucks up the rhythm of it.

3477
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:41,290
You know what's crazy and to do what's
really hard to do that I enjoy doing.

3478
01:35:41,291 --> 01:35:44,830
I enjoy it as an exercise
is a minute in a minute out.

3479
01:35:45,010 --> 01:35:45,550
Really?

3480
01:35:45,550 --> 01:35:46,100
Yeah.

3481
01:35:46,100 --> 01:35:48,940
I take a one minute breath in,

3482
01:35:49,060 --> 01:35:49,841
a slow,

3483
01:35:49,841 --> 01:35:54,841
one minute breath in and then a slow one
minute breath out and it's very hard to

3484
01:35:55,301 --> 01:35:58,690
not freak out and just
talk in the middle of it.

3485
01:35:58,691 --> 01:35:59,471
It's very hard to.

3486
01:35:59,471 --> 01:36:01,190
I do like 30 seconds back there at a lot.

3487
01:36:01,270 --> 01:36:05,140
I do it in the tank and that's
how I start my tank sessions.

3488
01:36:05,141 --> 01:36:09,180
I start my tank sessions by completely
controlling via always been alive,

3489
01:36:09,220 --> 01:36:09,910
breathing and.

3490
01:36:09,910 --> 01:36:10,390
No,

3491
01:36:10,390 --> 01:36:10,571
no.

3492
01:36:10,571 --> 01:36:12,210
I had a buildup to it.

3493
01:36:12,300 --> 01:36:12,701
Your Buddy,

3494
01:36:12,701 --> 01:36:13,300
uh,

3495
01:36:13,300 --> 01:36:15,110
was it that powerful denny?

3496
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:15,410
Yeah.

3497
01:36:15,410 --> 01:36:15,761
Powerful.

3498
01:36:15,761 --> 01:36:16,120
Danny.

3499
01:36:16,120 --> 01:36:16,361
He,

3500
01:36:16,361 --> 01:36:16,690
um,

3501
01:36:16,690 --> 01:36:18,020
he said he does yoga like every morning.

3502
01:36:18,030 --> 01:36:18,371
Oh yeah.

3503
01:36:18,371 --> 01:36:19,450
Danny's a bad motherfucker.

3504
01:36:19,900 --> 01:36:21,550
World champion and he's been,

3505
01:36:21,610 --> 01:36:23,110
I've known Dennis since
he was a young kid.

3506
01:36:23,110 --> 01:36:23,921
He's a great guy.

3507
01:36:23,921 --> 01:36:24,521
He's awesome.

3508
01:36:24,521 --> 01:36:24,730
Danny,

3509
01:36:24,730 --> 01:36:25,480
proper coast.

3510
01:36:25,480 --> 01:36:26,020
He's a,

3511
01:36:26,020 --> 01:36:28,330
he runs 10th planet Jiu
Jitsu in San Francisco.

3512
01:36:28,331 --> 01:36:28,960
He's,

3513
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:29,201
you know,

3514
01:36:29,201 --> 01:36:29,951
he's a young man,

3515
01:36:29,951 --> 01:36:32,890
but he's also a master
race developing master,

3516
01:36:33,170 --> 01:36:33,431
you know,

3517
01:36:33,431 --> 01:36:34,420
as he's getting better.

3518
01:36:34,870 --> 01:36:35,231
But uh,

3519
01:36:35,231 --> 01:36:36,064
he's uh,

3520
01:36:36,310 --> 01:36:38,140
he's really into yoga right now,

3521
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:43,060
Yoga and meditation and he had a few
back issues and he actually gave me some

3522
01:36:43,061 --> 01:36:44,610
pointers and uh,

3523
01:36:44,860 --> 01:36:45,311
because uh,

3524
01:36:45,311 --> 01:36:45,551
you know,

3525
01:36:45,551 --> 01:36:46,061
I had some,

3526
01:36:46,061 --> 01:36:49,120
I had a bulging disc in my back
that's actually been getting better,

3527
01:36:49,121 --> 01:36:52,990
but denny went through some back issues
himself and he did like a very strict

3528
01:36:52,991 --> 01:36:55,340
regiment of yoga and um,

3529
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:56,273
uh,

3530
01:36:56,280 --> 01:36:57,113
like,

3531
01:36:57,120 --> 01:36:59,580
like it was like a type of a tension.

3532
01:36:59,620 --> 01:37:03,610
It's like a spinal decompression where
it's like literally like pulling your

3533
01:37:03,611 --> 01:37:04,840
neck while this cord.

3534
01:37:05,050 --> 01:37:05,711
And he did this,

3535
01:37:05,711 --> 01:37:09,970
like very disciplined over course of
like five or six weeks or something like

3536
01:37:09,971 --> 01:37:11,080
that and fixed his issue.

3537
01:37:11,170 --> 01:37:11,500
Denny

3538
01:37:11,500 --> 01:37:12,610
has that quality too,

3539
01:37:12,611 --> 01:37:12,821
you know,

3540
01:37:12,821 --> 01:37:17,140
we were talking about how you can
sense bad energy and less dangerous.

3541
01:37:17,470 --> 01:37:19,150
Denny to me has,

3542
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:19,710
um,

3543
01:37:19,710 --> 01:37:21,640
like just being around him a few moments.

3544
01:37:21,641 --> 01:37:23,770
You sense like a type of balance?

3545
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:27,610
I get the feeling from him that I
do from a lot of people who are very

3546
01:37:27,611 --> 01:37:28,444
disciplined.

3547
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:30,160
There's a certain intensity to them,

3548
01:37:30,310 --> 01:37:31,690
but there's also like a certain amount,

3549
01:37:31,691 --> 01:37:35,350
like you can feel like
their control at work,

3550
01:37:35,410 --> 01:37:37,930
like there's such discipline
characters a lot of times,

3551
01:37:37,931 --> 01:37:39,490
like really good athletes.

3552
01:37:39,670 --> 01:37:42,340
There's that like energy
that they bring into a room,

3553
01:37:42,790 --> 01:37:43,061
you know,

3554
01:37:43,061 --> 01:37:43,620
like I know these,

3555
01:37:43,620 --> 01:37:46,420
like these guys that do
like triathlons and stuff,

3556
01:37:46,421 --> 01:37:47,230
they have this,

3557
01:37:47,230 --> 01:37:49,300
it's like a quiet intensity to them.

3558
01:37:50,150 --> 01:37:50,560
Like you,

3559
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:53,530
you meet them and you
can feel their presence.

3560
01:37:54,130 --> 01:37:56,040
Their discipline comes
through just in there

3561
01:37:56,220 --> 01:37:57,120
when they speak to you.

3562
01:37:57,210 --> 01:37:57,750
Yeah,

3563
01:37:57,750 --> 01:37:58,590
absolutely.

3564
01:37:58,680 --> 01:38:02,070
Now the best time for people to be around
the best type of people to be around

3565
01:38:02,150 --> 01:38:02,761
good influence.

3566
01:38:02,761 --> 01:38:03,870
Control apps.

3567
01:38:03,990 --> 01:38:04,280
Yeah.

3568
01:38:04,280 --> 01:38:05,490
Inspirational influence.

3569
01:38:05,500 --> 01:38:06,330
I agree.

3570
01:38:06,330 --> 01:38:06,840
I agree.

3571
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:07,490
And uh,

3572
01:38:07,490 --> 01:38:09,300
Denny Denny is definitely inspirational.

3573
01:38:09,301 --> 01:38:09,751
He's just,

3574
01:38:09,751 --> 01:38:10,470
I love them.

3575
01:38:10,470 --> 01:38:14,630
I love the fact that I've
seen him as a young man.

3576
01:38:14,660 --> 01:38:15,780
So I met him when he was very young.

3577
01:38:15,781 --> 01:38:18,720
I think it was like 17 or 18
and he was always a cool kid.

3578
01:38:18,721 --> 01:38:19,030
I mean,

3579
01:38:19,030 --> 01:38:19,920
even back then it was great.

3580
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:24,060
But to see him evolve and develop
and become the man he is now,

3581
01:38:24,240 --> 01:38:25,110
I love seeing that.

3582
01:38:25,111 --> 01:38:25,381
Man,

3583
01:38:25,381 --> 01:38:30,030
I love seeing people progress and I
love seeing people get it together,

3584
01:38:30,270 --> 01:38:30,810
you know,

3585
01:38:30,810 --> 01:38:32,640
like I was telling Tony
Hinchcliffe the other day,

3586
01:38:32,641 --> 01:38:34,890
I had him on the podcast and I was like,

3587
01:38:35,130 --> 01:38:37,740
I love the fact that in
the time I've known you,

3588
01:38:37,770 --> 01:38:39,390
you became a really good comedian.

3589
01:38:39,450 --> 01:38:39,920
Sure.

3590
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:40,400
You know,

3591
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:41,460
I love that.

3592
01:38:41,461 --> 01:38:42,061
I love that.

3593
01:38:42,061 --> 01:38:43,140
I didn't know a guy.

3594
01:38:43,141 --> 01:38:45,570
He started out and then I meet
him a couple of years later.

3595
01:38:45,571 --> 01:38:46,320
He's a great comedian.

3596
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:46,540
Oh,

3597
01:38:46,540 --> 01:38:47,000
do this.

3598
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:47,880
We got one right there.

3599
01:38:47,881 --> 01:38:48,541
That's pretty awesome.

3600
01:38:48,541 --> 01:38:49,470
It's fucking amazing.

3601
01:38:49,471 --> 01:38:50,070
He's great.

3602
01:38:50,070 --> 01:38:50,731
I love Tony.

3603
01:38:50,731 --> 01:38:51,100
Man.

3604
01:38:51,100 --> 01:38:52,920
That guy is so funny.

3605
01:38:52,950 --> 01:38:55,430
He's a total natural and like,

3606
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:55,720
he,

3607
01:38:55,720 --> 01:38:56,190
uh,

3608
01:38:56,190 --> 01:38:58,560
the best comics are the ones
that can't even help themselves.

3609
01:38:58,800 --> 01:38:59,131
Like if,

3610
01:38:59,131 --> 01:39:01,470
if a joke is in the room to be said,

3611
01:39:01,710 --> 01:39:02,431
he just jumped.

3612
01:39:02,431 --> 01:39:04,080
He dives on it like a fucking grenade.

3613
01:39:04,081 --> 01:39:04,321
Yeah,

3614
01:39:04,321 --> 01:39:05,040
absolutely.

3615
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:06,300
I love that feeling with comics.

3616
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:07,673
I love the um,

3617
01:39:07,710 --> 01:39:11,670
and I love seeing like I have so many
friends who I started out with who I'm

3618
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:14,760
proud of just watching them as my friends.

3619
01:39:16,450 --> 01:39:17,040
I brought a,

3620
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:17,401
you met,

3621
01:39:17,401 --> 01:39:18,150
met full shown.

3622
01:39:18,150 --> 01:39:18,983
I brought it.

3623
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:19,420
Oh,

3624
01:39:19,420 --> 01:39:20,260
I love that dude.

3625
01:39:20,330 --> 01:39:20,610
I mean,

3626
01:39:20,610 --> 01:39:21,930
he can't help himself either.

3627
01:39:22,280 --> 01:39:22,920
You're in the room.

3628
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:23,820
Great personality.

3629
01:39:23,821 --> 01:39:27,720
That guy is the best fun and he's a.

3630
01:39:27,810 --> 01:39:28,441
When you're around,

3631
01:39:28,441 --> 01:39:28,681
I'm like,

3632
01:39:28,681 --> 01:39:29,100
he's all,

3633
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:32,700
he's got a legit smile and then all the
sudden you're smiling and everybody's,

3634
01:39:32,970 --> 01:39:33,900
he's a great guy.

3635
01:39:33,930 --> 01:39:34,860
There's certain guys like that,

3636
01:39:34,861 --> 01:39:36,060
like we only talked a little bit,

3637
01:39:36,061 --> 01:39:37,190
but I can tell right away.

3638
01:39:37,230 --> 01:39:38,063
He's awesome.

3639
01:39:38,130 --> 01:39:38,963
He's awesome.

3640
01:39:39,060 --> 01:39:39,893
And um,

3641
01:39:40,050 --> 01:39:40,381
you know,

3642
01:39:40,381 --> 01:39:42,390
he had the week off and
I asked him to come with,

3643
01:39:42,450 --> 01:39:44,910
to do the show that I'm saying Thursday,

3644
01:39:44,911 --> 01:39:47,140
Saturday and Sunday and he fucking like,

3645
01:39:47,220 --> 01:39:49,440
brought the house down
every set it was honestly.

3646
01:39:49,590 --> 01:39:50,423
Yeah,

3647
01:39:51,240 --> 01:39:52,770
I would imagine he'd be really funny.

3648
01:39:52,870 --> 01:39:53,310
Yeah.

3649
01:39:53,310 --> 01:39:54,860
Anybody that came to the show,

3650
01:39:54,861 --> 01:39:56,670
it's Friday night and weekend.

3651
01:39:56,671 --> 01:39:57,481
Thank you very much.

3652
01:39:57,481 --> 01:39:58,314
You guys were awesome.

3653
01:39:58,620 --> 01:40:00,660
San Jose was the shit that was the shit.

3654
01:40:00,690 --> 01:40:02,880
Northern California might
be the best place on earth.

3655
01:40:03,060 --> 01:40:03,630
It's awesome.

3656
01:40:03,630 --> 01:40:04,650
It really might be.

3657
01:40:04,651 --> 01:40:04,891
I mean,

3658
01:40:04,891 --> 01:40:06,180
the weather's not the best.

3659
01:40:06,240 --> 01:40:07,073
It's not the best,

3660
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:09,840
but as far as like human
beings as far as intelligence,

3661
01:40:09,841 --> 01:40:11,490
like vibing with human beings,

3662
01:40:11,700 --> 01:40:15,090
I think I vibed better with Northern
California people than anybody on the

3663
01:40:15,091 --> 01:40:15,740
planet really.

3664
01:40:15,740 --> 01:40:16,573
I really do.

3665
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:19,530
I have some friends that live up there
and whenever I go to hang with them,

3666
01:40:19,531 --> 01:40:20,220
I always feel like,

3667
01:40:20,220 --> 01:40:20,820
God dammit,

3668
01:40:20,820 --> 01:40:22,200
why don't I live in northern California?

3669
01:40:22,260 --> 01:40:22,800
It's awesome.

3670
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:24,090
It's better is it?

3671
01:40:24,091 --> 01:40:24,301
You know,

3672
01:40:24,301 --> 01:40:24,961
the weather sucks.

3673
01:40:24,961 --> 01:40:25,794
The Fat Dick Though,

3674
01:40:26,430 --> 01:40:30,600
unless you know that's only a negative
if you don't enjoy sucking dicks.

3675
01:40:30,620 --> 01:40:30,810
Yeah,

3676
01:40:30,810 --> 01:40:32,430
but if you enjoy sucking fat decks,

3677
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:35,430
I'm just talking from my own personal
perspective and I'm not trying to be

3678
01:40:35,431 --> 01:40:36,540
sexist or homophobic.

3679
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:38,790
Some of them are too big to
really get in your mouth.

3680
01:40:38,791 --> 01:40:39,030
Right?

3681
01:40:39,030 --> 01:40:41,820
Especially if it's like a
demon dick or a big giant word.

3682
01:40:41,820 --> 01:40:43,140
Harm the only ones a mouth.

3683
01:40:43,141 --> 01:40:43,660
Fuck you.

3684
01:40:43,660 --> 01:40:45,570
That's not beyond the
realm of possibility.

3685
01:40:45,780 --> 01:40:47,460
I watched a chimp fuck a frog.

3686
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:48,660
You know,

3687
01:40:48,660 --> 01:40:50,250
watching chimp fucking frogs face.

3688
01:40:50,620 --> 01:40:51,453
I'm.

3689
01:40:51,720 --> 01:40:52,130
No.

3690
01:40:52,130 --> 01:40:53,040
Has a video of it.

3691
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:54,790
There's a video of it
online and we've seen it.

3692
01:40:54,830 --> 01:40:55,330
Put CV.

3693
01:40:55,330 --> 01:40:55,721
Pull it up,

3694
01:40:55,721 --> 01:40:56,320
Jeremy.

3695
01:40:56,320 --> 01:41:01,320
I have seen a poor knows where I see
the girl really struggled to get a guy's

3696
01:41:01,391 --> 01:41:02,860
soft dick into her mouth and I'm like,

3697
01:41:03,010 --> 01:41:04,360
that's a big Dick right there.

3698
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:07,120
She's really struggling with his limp.

3699
01:41:07,140 --> 01:41:10,570
She like her mouth is all dry.

3700
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:11,140
Wow.

3701
01:41:11,140 --> 01:41:13,180
That's really fucking
stretching under all that.

3702
01:41:13,181 --> 01:41:15,220
Math is tough to generate saliva,

3703
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:19,060
dry blow jobs that take too long.

3704
01:41:19,061 --> 01:41:20,440
Dry blow jobs take too long.

3705
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:21,633
That's a

3706
01:41:22,990 --> 01:41:23,561
chimp rapes.

3707
01:41:23,561 --> 01:41:25,930
A frog maybe makes this frog suck him off.

3708
01:41:26,170 --> 01:41:31,170
So because we know this exists because
we know that this chimp takes this frog

3709
01:41:31,511 --> 01:41:35,650
and picks it up and puts it on his little
chimp cock and Fox it because we know

3710
01:41:35,651 --> 01:41:36,400
that exists.

3711
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:41,400
I don't think it's that preposterous to
propose that in an alternate world there

3712
01:41:41,441 --> 01:41:43,780
could be a giant boar that makes you suck.

3713
01:41:43,781 --> 01:41:46,310
His cock he wants to do is
hold a personality flaw.

3714
01:41:46,330 --> 01:41:47,650
Rape in that mouth right now,

3715
01:41:47,740 --> 01:41:51,030
fucks it up night with them,

3716
01:41:51,190 --> 01:41:51,850
and by the way,

3717
01:41:51,850 --> 01:41:53,650
this is not the only
time this has happened.

3718
01:41:53,680 --> 01:41:55,690
There's another video of
a chimp fucking a frog.

3719
01:41:55,900 --> 01:41:57,190
Apparently when chimps get frogs,

3720
01:41:57,191 --> 01:42:00,730
they fuck them beat off using that fraud.

3721
01:42:01,020 --> 01:42:01,590
This,

3722
01:42:01,590 --> 01:42:04,750
this is some shit we never saw a
mutual of Omaha's wild kingdom.

3723
01:42:05,700 --> 01:42:06,880
They would have edited this out.

3724
01:42:07,090 --> 01:42:09,160
We need the internet to
give us this information.

3725
01:42:09,340 --> 01:42:12,430
Mutual of Omaha's wild kingdom would
have you believe that chimps are cute

3726
01:42:12,431 --> 01:42:16,870
friends to be taken with on
rides in semis on sitcoms.

3727
01:42:17,260 --> 01:42:17,830
This.

3728
01:42:17,830 --> 01:42:18,850
This is what they are.

3729
01:42:18,910 --> 01:42:19,601
Ship is busted.

3730
01:42:19,601 --> 01:42:22,030
I received this murderous frog rapers.

3731
01:42:22,031 --> 01:42:22,510
To be fair.

3732
01:42:22,510 --> 01:42:23,680
I bet it does feel pretty decent.

3733
01:42:24,010 --> 01:42:24,620
Probably feels good.

3734
01:42:24,620 --> 01:42:27,160
I feel better about your own impulsive,

3735
01:42:27,250 --> 01:42:28,690
like nature when you see that.

3736
01:42:28,710 --> 01:42:28,990
Yeah.

3737
01:42:28,990 --> 01:42:30,210
I would try snake that like,

3738
01:42:30,270 --> 01:42:31,990
like cut off the head and fuck the snake.

3739
01:42:32,440 --> 01:42:33,161
Not a bad idea,

3740
01:42:33,161 --> 01:42:36,400
but the whole you need a whole
frogs have a nice big hole.

3741
01:42:36,970 --> 01:42:37,241
You know,

3742
01:42:37,241 --> 01:42:40,390
if you can keep them from clamping down
on your cock and balls and I think that

3743
01:42:40,391 --> 01:42:42,910
maybe chimps probably have
a much more leathery skin.

3744
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:46,120
Then I think that was the
whole idea in the beginning.

3745
01:42:46,340 --> 01:42:46,570
You know,

3746
01:42:46,570 --> 01:42:49,930
we had more leathery skin and then
that's why the head retracted.

3747
01:42:49,931 --> 01:42:52,360
You have the sensitive tip and
that's what makes you shoot,

3748
01:42:52,570 --> 01:42:56,320
but the average cock back in the day was
probably a lot tougher than the Kochs

3749
01:42:56,321 --> 01:42:56,980
have today.

3750
01:42:56,980 --> 01:42:58,690
What is fucking dicks today?

3751
01:42:58,780 --> 01:43:00,580
They can't take branches.

3752
01:43:00,610 --> 01:43:04,420
Snap it into them are rubbing up against
gravel where you fucking try to climb

3753
01:43:04,421 --> 01:43:05,620
up the rocks at the beach.

3754
01:43:05,830 --> 01:43:07,720
Now these cops are today or a week.

3755
01:43:07,780 --> 01:43:07,990
Yeah,

3756
01:43:07,990 --> 01:43:08,490
because you would,

3757
01:43:08,490 --> 01:43:09,200
you would funk,

3758
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:10,150
you would fuck winches,

3759
01:43:10,180 --> 01:43:11,980
winches and you wouldn't wash it off.

3760
01:43:12,010 --> 01:43:12,480
You're just like,

3761
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:13,360
you know that winches.

3762
01:43:13,361 --> 01:43:14,560
Is that what they used to become?

3763
01:43:14,570 --> 01:43:16,030
Winch a winch winches?

3764
01:43:16,031 --> 01:43:16,160
No.

3765
01:43:16,160 --> 01:43:16,841
Fuck a winch.

3766
01:43:16,841 --> 01:43:20,080
A winch is a thing you put on the back
of a truck to pull a log out of a ditch

3767
01:43:20,440 --> 01:43:21,310
that's a winch,

3768
01:43:21,610 --> 01:43:22,990
a winch winches.

3769
01:43:22,991 --> 01:43:27,390
I think the look because I got in trouble
for saying winches on fear factor was

3770
01:43:27,870 --> 01:43:28,180
you're like,

3771
01:43:28,180 --> 01:43:28,870
see,

3772
01:43:28,870 --> 01:43:30,640
I was just trying to motivate a girl.

3773
01:43:30,670 --> 01:43:31,330
And um,

3774
01:43:31,330 --> 01:43:33,750
she was on an all girls
fear factor and um,

3775
01:43:34,020 --> 01:43:35,560
there was these other
girls there were saying,

3776
01:43:35,561 --> 01:43:36,161
don't do it.

3777
01:43:36,161 --> 01:43:36,940
Don't do it though,

3778
01:43:36,940 --> 01:43:37,660
because she,

3779
01:43:37,660 --> 01:43:40,450
she was scared and so they were trying
to make her more scared and I said,

3780
01:43:40,451 --> 01:43:40,720
hey,

3781
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:40,991
I go,

3782
01:43:40,991 --> 01:43:41,291
listen,

3783
01:43:41,291 --> 01:43:41,680
listen to me.

3784
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:42,970
Don't listen to those caddy winches.

3785
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:44,021
Wow.

3786
01:43:44,021 --> 01:43:44,854
So what,

3787
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:46,330
like what would a winch be today?

3788
01:43:46,331 --> 01:43:46,571
Like A.

3789
01:43:46,571 --> 01:43:47,110
Whoa,

3790
01:43:47,110 --> 01:43:47,590
yes.

3791
01:43:47,590 --> 01:43:48,423
The parent.

3792
01:43:49,080 --> 01:43:50,170
What they said what the why.

3793
01:43:50,230 --> 01:43:53,180
The reason why I got in is because
apparently a wench is like a prostitute.

3794
01:43:53,930 --> 01:43:54,531
I mean,

3795
01:43:54,531 --> 01:43:56,150
we're talking medieval time folks.

3796
01:43:56,151 --> 01:43:56,451
Okay.

3797
01:43:56,451 --> 01:43:57,261
Is it really,

3798
01:43:57,261 --> 01:43:58,430
is that what it really means?

3799
01:43:58,940 --> 01:44:00,530
It doesn't mean what it means.

3800
01:44:00,531 --> 01:44:02,720
The cultural context and
the cultural context.

3801
01:44:02,721 --> 01:44:04,430
Where I grew up in Boston,

3802
01:44:04,670 --> 01:44:05,840
a wench was a like,

3803
01:44:05,970 --> 01:44:06,500
ah,

3804
01:44:06,500 --> 01:44:08,000
fucking wench is like,

3805
01:44:08,001 --> 01:44:09,170
she was kind of a bitch.

3806
01:44:09,320 --> 01:44:10,430
She was like a little bitch.

3807
01:44:10,510 --> 01:44:10,760
I trust,

3808
01:44:10,760 --> 01:44:11,180
you know,

3809
01:44:11,180 --> 01:44:11,771
winches and,

3810
01:44:11,771 --> 01:44:15,380
and so a caddy winch
would not be a prostitute.

3811
01:44:15,381 --> 01:44:19,520
It would be a chick that talks too fucking
much and is trying to damage a young

3812
01:44:19,521 --> 01:44:23,180
ladies confidence in completing
a challenge for $50,000.

3813
01:44:23,960 --> 01:44:25,520
Wench Patty wench.

3814
01:44:26,030 --> 01:44:30,500
But people get all upset they got or they
got all upset and this was back in the

3815
01:44:30,500 --> 01:44:31,430
day and this is a fear factor,

3816
01:44:31,431 --> 01:44:33,560
like season two or something like that.

3817
01:44:33,590 --> 01:44:34,910
It's not like today.

3818
01:44:34,911 --> 01:44:36,410
If you said anything like that today,

3819
01:44:36,411 --> 01:44:37,400
you'd probably get arrested.

3820
01:44:38,290 --> 01:44:38,570
You know,

3821
01:44:38,570 --> 01:44:42,940
somebody tweeted like that
rh sit on his recent podcast,

3822
01:44:42,941 --> 01:44:46,550
a punch drunk that he doesn't believe
half the stories I say that story is

3823
01:44:46,551 --> 01:44:46,881
useful.

3824
01:44:46,881 --> 01:44:47,270
Yeah.

3825
01:44:47,270 --> 01:44:47,720
And I'm like,

3826
01:44:47,720 --> 01:44:48,021
what?

3827
01:44:48,021 --> 01:44:48,530
How?

3828
01:44:48,530 --> 01:44:49,620
Why would I wake make no?

3829
01:44:49,730 --> 01:44:54,680
How would I make that shit up that
even me merely because you're a little

3830
01:44:54,681 --> 01:44:55,514
awkward,

3831
01:44:55,970 --> 01:44:56,470
right?

3832
01:44:56,470 --> 01:44:57,303
A little.

3833
01:44:58,120 --> 01:44:59,440
But yeah.

3834
01:44:59,850 --> 01:45:04,850
And you've been known to tell a
story a bit on the exaggerating side

3835
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:06,620
to make it more exciting.

3836
01:45:06,621 --> 01:45:07,130
Maybe.

3837
01:45:07,130 --> 01:45:07,963
Occasionally.

3838
01:45:07,970 --> 01:45:11,090
But that doesn't mean
that you're not a liar.

3839
01:45:11,300 --> 01:45:12,170
I really think,

3840
01:45:12,250 --> 01:45:12,770
uh,

3841
01:45:12,770 --> 01:45:15,510
just need to follow me around to these
massage parlors and stuff like that.

3842
01:45:15,511 --> 01:45:16,250
I don't believe me.

3843
01:45:16,250 --> 01:45:16,491
Yeah.

3844
01:45:16,491 --> 01:45:21,491
You also live an extraordinary
life sexually that I'm
sure he's not really able

3845
01:45:22,521 --> 01:45:26,430
to deal with that because he knew you
back in the day when you were kind of a

3846
01:45:26,440 --> 01:45:28,120
zero and a.

3847
01:45:28,220 --> 01:45:29,420
I just hate that you were a hero.

3848
01:45:29,450 --> 01:45:30,051
I hate that shit.

3849
01:45:30,051 --> 01:45:31,000
I hate when you know.

3850
01:45:31,020 --> 01:45:31,970
It's stuff like that though.

3851
01:45:32,030 --> 01:45:32,500
Like I said,

3852
01:45:32,500 --> 01:45:33,230
hey,

3853
01:45:33,230 --> 01:45:34,520
if you really don't believe my stores,

3854
01:45:34,521 --> 01:45:35,360
why don't you ask now,

3855
01:45:35,930 --> 01:45:36,380
here's,

3856
01:45:36,380 --> 01:45:37,000
here's,

3857
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:37,833
here's really what I think.

3858
01:45:38,110 --> 01:45:38,943
Why care?

3859
01:45:39,080 --> 01:45:39,680
Why was he,

3860
01:45:39,680 --> 01:45:40,550
why does he care?

3861
01:45:40,580 --> 01:45:41,410
Why do you,

3862
01:45:41,410 --> 01:45:42,500
you guys are friends.

3863
01:45:42,501 --> 01:45:43,334
What is that about?

3864
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:43,640
You know,

3865
01:45:43,640 --> 01:45:44,001
it's about,

3866
01:45:44,001 --> 01:45:44,990
it's a distracting.

3867
01:45:45,350 --> 01:45:45,610
It's,

3868
01:45:45,610 --> 01:45:46,910
it's an energy distraction.

3869
01:45:46,911 --> 01:45:49,130
It's not something to focus
on for him or for you.

3870
01:45:49,340 --> 01:45:50,390
He shouldn't have focused on it.

3871
01:45:50,391 --> 01:45:51,350
You shouldn't focus on it.

3872
01:45:51,650 --> 01:45:51,951
You know,

3873
01:45:51,951 --> 01:45:53,200
it's like in.

3874
01:45:53,210 --> 01:45:57,620
Sometimes you're on a podcast and you're
ranting and he wants to keep it real

3875
01:45:57,621 --> 01:45:58,730
and that's really what he thinks.

3876
01:45:59,020 --> 01:45:59,231
You know?

3877
01:45:59,231 --> 01:46:00,064
There's that too,

3878
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:01,730
but it's unnecessary.

3879
01:46:01,790 --> 01:46:02,011
It's,

3880
01:46:02,011 --> 01:46:02,810
it's when,

3881
01:46:02,810 --> 01:46:03,770
when you do that,

3882
01:46:03,771 --> 01:46:07,100
especially like with a friend you put
out like a certain amount of energy,

3883
01:46:07,101 --> 01:46:08,300
you put out a certain thing,

3884
01:46:08,330 --> 01:46:08,510
you know,

3885
01:46:08,510 --> 01:46:10,460
you put it out there and then okay,

3886
01:46:10,461 --> 01:46:12,920
well then that has to be responded to it.

3887
01:46:12,921 --> 01:46:16,070
Like it's being responded to now and he
probably didn't even think about that

3888
01:46:16,071 --> 01:46:16,790
when he did it,

3889
01:46:16,790 --> 01:46:20,360
but if he just said it or if he just
thought it and then didn't say it,

3890
01:46:20,750 --> 01:46:21,800
it'd be way better off.

3891
01:46:22,070 --> 01:46:24,290
Or if he wanted to talk to you about it,

3892
01:46:24,830 --> 01:46:25,490
just say,

3893
01:46:25,490 --> 01:46:26,090
hey man,

3894
01:46:26,090 --> 01:46:29,360
I just want to tell you that sometimes
you tell stories and I think they're

3895
01:46:29,361 --> 01:46:30,194
fucking.

3896
01:46:30,640 --> 01:46:31,330
I don't trust them.

3897
01:46:31,330 --> 01:46:31,550
Right.

3898
01:46:31,550 --> 01:46:31,630
Okay.

3899
01:46:31,630 --> 01:46:31,950
So.

3900
01:46:31,950 --> 01:46:33,650
And then I would say what stories are.

3901
01:46:34,330 --> 01:46:35,163
Yeah,

3902
01:46:35,560 --> 01:46:36,620
but you know,

3903
01:46:36,910 --> 01:46:39,340
you do tell a squirrely story on occasion.

3904
01:46:40,180 --> 01:46:41,013
I can't remember.

3905
01:46:41,120 --> 01:46:43,570
So I can have people that
were involved in the story.

3906
01:46:43,571 --> 01:46:44,181
There are no,

3907
01:46:44,181 --> 01:46:44,451
no,

3908
01:46:44,451 --> 01:46:45,030
no.

3909
01:46:45,030 --> 01:46:45,480
Listen.

3910
01:46:45,480 --> 01:46:45,831
Okay,

3911
01:46:45,831 --> 01:46:49,090
well that's even more ridiculous because
you're saying you've never exaggerated

3912
01:46:49,110 --> 01:46:50,100
or told the story a little

3913
01:46:50,230 --> 01:46:50,440
bit.

3914
01:46:50,440 --> 01:46:52,020
I would have to have an example.

3915
01:46:52,100 --> 01:46:52,500
You know,

3916
01:46:52,500 --> 01:46:54,060
I'm in high school,

3917
01:46:54,990 --> 01:46:55,620
never did it.

3918
01:46:55,620 --> 01:46:56,161
Like I'm saying,

3919
01:46:56,161 --> 01:46:57,330
like as an example,

3920
01:46:57,331 --> 01:47:00,240
I would probably be prone
to saying something like,

3921
01:47:00,630 --> 01:47:01,500
uh,

3922
01:47:01,501 --> 01:47:02,011
yeah,

3923
01:47:02,011 --> 01:47:03,660
that girl was like fucking hot man.

3924
01:47:03,690 --> 01:47:04,800
She was like an La 10,

3925
01:47:04,801 --> 01:47:05,220
you know,

3926
01:47:05,220 --> 01:47:07,140
when maybe she was like seven or eight,

3927
01:47:07,530 --> 01:47:08,250
something like that.

3928
01:47:08,250 --> 01:47:10,410
Nothing like a slight exaggeration,

3929
01:47:10,440 --> 01:47:11,120
but I,

3930
01:47:11,120 --> 01:47:11,720
I

3931
01:47:11,720 --> 01:47:13,250
appreciate it when someone
tells me the truth.

3932
01:47:13,470 --> 01:47:14,810
Like Ra would tell them the truth.

3933
01:47:14,940 --> 01:47:15,120
Go,

3934
01:47:15,120 --> 01:47:15,800
what did she look like?

3935
01:47:15,800 --> 01:47:16,320
You Go,

3936
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:17,153
oh,

3937
01:47:17,320 --> 01:47:18,153
maybe,

3938
01:47:18,390 --> 01:47:19,010
right.

3939
01:47:19,010 --> 01:47:19,843
Maybe

3940
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:22,460
he wouldn't say,

3941
01:47:22,460 --> 01:47:22,701
oh,

3942
01:47:22,701 --> 01:47:25,340
she was 10 greatest piece of ass ever.

3943
01:47:25,530 --> 01:47:25,820
You know,

3944
01:47:25,820 --> 01:47:29,900
everybody appreciates that more
than they appreciate exaggeration,

3945
01:47:30,290 --> 01:47:31,220
exaggeration.

3946
01:47:31,250 --> 01:47:32,210
Although I enjoy it.

3947
01:47:32,270 --> 01:47:35,270
Like Joey Diaz style exaggeration is
the greatest fucking thing on earth.

3948
01:47:35,330 --> 01:47:35,781
Absolutely.

3949
01:47:35,781 --> 01:47:36,081
I mean,

3950
01:47:36,081 --> 01:47:38,780
so in a way it's hypocritical
so you don't enjoy exaggeration.

3951
01:47:38,990 --> 01:47:39,860
It's just saying you know,

3952
01:47:39,870 --> 01:47:41,350
enjoy that.

3953
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:41,950
But you know,

3954
01:47:41,950 --> 01:47:45,870
Joey also tells them a very honest
story as well with the crazy saturations

3955
01:47:45,880 --> 01:47:46,280
that,

3956
01:47:46,280 --> 01:47:46,731
you know,

3957
01:47:46,731 --> 01:47:47,930
or for comedic effect.

3958
01:47:47,931 --> 01:47:48,111
I mean,

3959
01:47:48,111 --> 01:47:49,700
it's like part of the fun of it all,

3960
01:47:49,910 --> 01:47:52,350
but that's also part of each of the,

3961
01:47:52,370 --> 01:47:53,630
these people's nature.

3962
01:47:53,990 --> 01:47:55,850
Like Ari is a guy who,

3963
01:47:56,060 --> 01:47:57,020
he's not like,

3964
01:47:57,310 --> 01:47:57,550
oh,

3965
01:47:57,550 --> 01:47:59,980
I'm going to add all this
little spice to the story.

3966
01:47:59,990 --> 01:48:01,520
He doesn't like it when you do it either.

3967
01:48:01,521 --> 01:48:01,731
Right.

3968
01:48:01,731 --> 01:48:02,780
And he's a very specific.

3969
01:48:02,781 --> 01:48:03,290
Yeah,

3970
01:48:03,290 --> 01:48:05,810
he doesn't want you to bullshit
him because he's not a bullshitter,

3971
01:48:06,050 --> 01:48:07,360
but that's his own trip to,

3972
01:48:07,361 --> 01:48:07,611
you know,

3973
01:48:07,611 --> 01:48:11,180
his own trip is that he's very like
focused and ambitious now and he doesn't

3974
01:48:11,181 --> 01:48:12,260
want to hear any nonsense,

3975
01:48:12,500 --> 01:48:12,891
you know?

3976
01:48:12,891 --> 01:48:13,180
And,

3977
01:48:13,180 --> 01:48:15,890
and that's because he's on
a great groove right now.

3978
01:48:15,891 --> 01:48:17,780
He doesn't want anything getting hijacked,

3979
01:48:18,090 --> 01:48:22,340
whether it's this time hijacked where
the fake story or someone giving them a

3980
01:48:22,341 --> 01:48:24,770
fake impression of what happened.

3981
01:48:24,780 --> 01:48:28,040
Another guy who you've
witnessed crazy leap.

3982
01:48:28,100 --> 01:48:28,551
Dude,

3983
01:48:28,551 --> 01:48:32,240
we were with Ari when he was
first starting at the store.

3984
01:48:32,241 --> 01:48:34,250
I think when Ari came to the store.

3985
01:48:34,580 --> 01:48:34,941
I hate that.

3986
01:48:34,941 --> 01:48:35,774
I don't know this,

3987
01:48:35,870 --> 01:48:36,703
but I don't know if he's.

3988
01:48:36,920 --> 01:48:41,920
I think he started out his first
sets in DC right now I think.

3989
01:48:42,501 --> 01:48:44,780
But then when he came over the DC Improv,

3990
01:48:44,781 --> 01:48:44,960
right?

3991
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:46,910
Because I remember him
having a hard time for them.

3992
01:48:47,030 --> 01:48:49,400
I'm taking him seriously.

3993
01:48:49,940 --> 01:48:50,870
You Say Baltimore?

3994
01:48:50,930 --> 01:48:51,980
I thought he was from Baltimore,

3995
01:48:51,981 --> 01:48:52,300
Maryland.

3996
01:48:52,300 --> 01:48:53,133
He's from it.

3997
01:48:54,130 --> 01:48:55,220
It's close enough close.

3998
01:48:55,221 --> 01:48:57,320
But he's not from Baltimore
now he's from Washington DC.

3999
01:48:57,620 --> 01:48:58,453
But um,

4000
01:48:58,880 --> 01:48:59,900
he's from Maryland.

4001
01:48:59,990 --> 01:49:01,310
I mean DC and Maryland.

4002
01:49:01,400 --> 01:49:02,900
I mean they're like
right next to each other.

4003
01:49:02,950 --> 01:49:03,430
Yeah.

4004
01:49:03,430 --> 01:49:04,790
In Virginia is right there too.

4005
01:49:05,210 --> 01:49:05,750
Anyway,

4006
01:49:05,750 --> 01:49:09,980
point being he came over here
when he was fairly new to comedy,

4007
01:49:10,260 --> 01:49:10,520
you know,

4008
01:49:10,520 --> 01:49:11,990
but he was a really smart dude.

4009
01:49:11,991 --> 01:49:13,130
He was always a smart dude.

4010
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:17,720
We became friends like immediately he
was a young kid hanging out at the comedy

4011
01:49:17,721 --> 01:49:18,680
store and uh,

4012
01:49:18,850 --> 01:49:19,090
you know,

4013
01:49:19,090 --> 01:49:21,050
I remember at first he was like,

4014
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:22,113
you know,

4015
01:49:22,280 --> 01:49:25,700
everybody's weird around people that are
already like successful when you're an

4016
01:49:25,701 --> 01:49:26,240
amateur.

4017
01:49:26,240 --> 01:49:26,540
You're like,

4018
01:49:26,540 --> 01:49:28,280
you can't believe you're
allowed to even talk to them.

4019
01:49:28,280 --> 01:49:29,420
Of course they get weird,

4020
01:49:29,540 --> 01:49:31,250
but then once you get past that weirdness,

4021
01:49:31,251 --> 01:49:31,700
he realized,

4022
01:49:31,700 --> 01:49:32,330
Oh,

4023
01:49:32,330 --> 01:49:32,721
you know,

4024
01:49:32,721 --> 01:49:36,020
that's just Tommy Lauren
or Tommy Tommy Lawrence.

4025
01:49:36,380 --> 01:49:37,213
What's his name?

4026
01:49:37,250 --> 01:49:39,260
What's the fucking guys
from in living color?

4027
01:49:39,320 --> 01:49:40,220
What the Hell's the Tommy Davidson?

4028
01:49:40,221 --> 01:49:41,054
Tommy Davidson.

4029
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:45,950
A confusing with Joey Lawrence for some
reason because the first time I saw Joey

4030
01:49:45,950 --> 01:49:47,540
Lawrence was one of the
first celebrities oversaw.

4031
01:49:47,600 --> 01:49:48,040
Yeah.

4032
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:48,550
And uh,

4033
01:49:48,550 --> 01:49:52,180
I was on the set of news radio and Joey
Lawrence had his show right next to our

4034
01:49:52,181 --> 01:49:53,370
show is like a,

4035
01:49:53,560 --> 01:49:55,250
he had his Mercedes there and he was like,

4036
01:49:55,410 --> 01:49:59,470
he had his leg outside the car and he's
like singing along to his own song.

4037
01:49:59,850 --> 01:50:00,683
And I was like,

4038
01:50:01,240 --> 01:50:01,901
and I showed up.

4039
01:50:01,901 --> 01:50:02,340
I was like,

4040
01:50:02,340 --> 01:50:03,380
it was kind of starstruck.

4041
01:50:03,420 --> 01:50:03,641
I was like,

4042
01:50:03,641 --> 01:50:04,061
Holy Shit,

4043
01:50:04,061 --> 01:50:04,900
this Joey Lawrence.

4044
01:50:04,950 --> 01:50:05,181
Wow.

4045
01:50:05,181 --> 01:50:06,011
There's Joey Lawrence,

4046
01:50:06,011 --> 01:50:07,700
like singing his own his own shit.

4047
01:50:07,780 --> 01:50:08,710
Buy his own car.

4048
01:50:08,950 --> 01:50:10,990
So Tommy Davidson was another one.

4049
01:50:11,170 --> 01:50:13,660
I remember first talking to Tommy
Davidson at the comedy store.

4050
01:50:13,810 --> 01:50:14,680
Tommy Davidson was like,

4051
01:50:14,681 --> 01:50:14,981
hey man,

4052
01:50:14,981 --> 01:50:15,760
what's going on man?

4053
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:17,540
Like he didn't know who the fuck I was.

4054
01:50:17,541 --> 01:50:20,260
I was nobody when I
first came to the store.

4055
01:50:20,261 --> 01:50:23,650
I mean I might've been a paid regular
but I might not even been a paid regular

4056
01:50:23,651 --> 01:50:24,190
yet.

4057
01:50:24,190 --> 01:50:24,970
And then I realized,

4058
01:50:24,970 --> 01:50:25,181
Oh,

4059
01:50:25,181 --> 01:50:26,680
Tommy Davidson is just a comic,

4060
01:50:26,830 --> 01:50:27,340
you know,

4061
01:50:27,340 --> 01:50:28,450
like we're all just comics.

4062
01:50:28,770 --> 01:50:32,560
And then I always tried to
be the same way with guys,

4063
01:50:32,590 --> 01:50:33,423
young guys,

4064
01:50:33,790 --> 01:50:34,630
young guys coming up.

4065
01:50:34,640 --> 01:50:34,870
I,

4066
01:50:34,870 --> 01:50:38,680
I always tried to make sure I let them
all know we're all just the same fucking

4067
01:50:38,681 --> 01:50:39,250
thing,

4068
01:50:39,250 --> 01:50:40,480
just because that's Tim Allen,

4069
01:50:40,720 --> 01:50:42,180
just because you see
George Carlin over there,

4070
01:50:42,200 --> 01:50:43,600
he's a comic there comics.

4071
01:50:43,601 --> 01:50:44,380
Everybody's cool here,

4072
01:50:44,380 --> 01:50:44,600
you know,

4073
01:50:44,600 --> 01:50:45,850
this is a cool environment.

4074
01:50:46,420 --> 01:50:47,350
And Ari was like,

4075
01:50:47,351 --> 01:50:50,470
one of the first guys that
I saw go from being like,

4076
01:50:50,471 --> 01:50:50,890
you know,

4077
01:50:50,890 --> 01:50:53,680
like an open mic or to like
a fucking legit headliner,

4078
01:50:53,890 --> 01:50:58,390
like a real headliner who comes up with
an hours where the new shit every year.

4079
01:50:58,450 --> 01:50:59,283
It's pretty crazy.

4080
01:50:59,290 --> 01:51:00,300
He's a bad motherfucker.

4081
01:51:00,640 --> 01:51:01,570
Who's great at your,

4082
01:51:01,571 --> 01:51:01,811
uh,

4083
01:51:01,811 --> 01:51:02,351
your,

4084
01:51:02,351 --> 01:51:02,830
uh,

4085
01:51:02,830 --> 01:51:07,030
your thing for your dog he was
killing is both men and howling.

4086
01:51:07,600 --> 01:51:09,970
So important to have good comedy,

4087
01:51:09,971 --> 01:51:10,330
man.

4088
01:51:10,330 --> 01:51:13,450
Without good comedy I life would
not be nearly as interesting.

4089
01:51:13,451 --> 01:51:14,090
Man.

4090
01:51:14,090 --> 01:51:15,380
Wouldn't be as interesting to,

4091
01:51:15,530 --> 01:51:19,390
to perform because you'd be looking
around and all this other stuff and you

4092
01:51:19,391 --> 01:51:20,470
wouldn't be enjoying yourself.

4093
01:51:20,980 --> 01:51:21,311
You know?

4094
01:51:21,311 --> 01:51:22,450
It wouldn't be interesting.

4095
01:51:22,480 --> 01:51:23,830
It's interesting to watch.

4096
01:51:24,190 --> 01:51:25,930
Of course you're fucking
clock is not right.

4097
01:51:25,931 --> 01:51:26,660
Brian.

4098
01:51:26,660 --> 01:51:27,520
I think me hours,

4099
01:51:27,580 --> 01:51:31,030
but it's an hour behind your thoughts
on the while looking at your clock.

4100
01:51:31,031 --> 01:51:31,300
I'm like,

4101
01:51:31,300 --> 01:51:32,830
why do I have to pee so bad?

4102
01:51:33,160 --> 01:51:34,930
I haven't even been
sitting here that long.

4103
01:51:36,010 --> 01:51:37,550
I'm going to take a piss and uh,

4104
01:51:37,600 --> 01:51:39,490
don't let him talk about
anything too silly when I'm gone.

4105
01:51:40,360 --> 01:51:40,540
Hey,

4106
01:51:40,540 --> 01:51:41,373
no silliness.

4107
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:46,480
A set time and we should
talk about your podcast.

4108
01:51:46,540 --> 01:51:46,740
Uh,

4109
01:51:46,740 --> 01:51:47,573
you just,

4110
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:48,713
uh,

4111
01:51:49,700 --> 01:51:50,340
just,

4112
01:51:50,340 --> 01:51:51,173
uh,

4113
01:51:52,410 --> 01:51:53,290
something really silly.

4114
01:51:53,320 --> 01:51:53,500
Oh,

4115
01:51:53,500 --> 01:51:54,333
okay.

4116
01:51:54,450 --> 01:51:55,270
Um,

4117
01:51:55,270 --> 01:51:55,691
oh my God,

4118
01:51:55,691 --> 01:51:55,931
I got it.

4119
01:51:55,931 --> 01:51:56,830
I got the silliest thing.

4120
01:51:56,860 --> 01:51:57,021
Poop.

4121
01:51:57,021 --> 01:51:58,690
I take a May 2nd.

4122
01:51:58,691 --> 01:52:03,691
I'm in Toronto and I'm doing this
show at the underground comedy club.

4123
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:05,020
And then May 17th,

4124
01:52:05,021 --> 01:52:10,021
I'm in Portland at the fun house lounge
and we added a second show at 10:30.

4125
01:52:10,061 --> 01:52:11,320
How silly is that?

4126
01:52:11,370 --> 01:52:11,640
All right.

4127
01:52:11,640 --> 01:52:11,920
Hey,

4128
01:52:11,920 --> 01:52:13,180
I'm going to be May 3rd.

4129
01:52:13,181 --> 01:52:15,700
I'm going to be in
Sacramento and it May 4th.

4130
01:52:15,701 --> 01:52:18,730
I'm going to be in Sacramento and May
5th or may be at Cobb's in San Francisco

4131
01:52:18,731 --> 01:52:21,760
and I'm bringing a Sam
Tripoli and Tony Hinchcliffe.

4132
01:52:21,850 --> 01:52:21,971
Oh,

4133
01:52:21,971 --> 01:52:22,720
this is silly.

4134
01:52:22,720 --> 01:52:23,980
And you know what I was wondering,

4135
01:52:24,130 --> 01:52:26,230
because you've been doing
some shows with your,

4136
01:52:26,231 --> 01:52:26,561

4137
01:52:26,561 --> 01:52:26,920
uh,

4138
01:52:26,920 --> 01:52:28,240
your lovely wife,

4139
01:52:28,241 --> 01:52:28,710
Christina.

4140
01:52:28,710 --> 01:52:31,480
Has Jessica was Jessica
and how did that go?

4141
01:52:31,590 --> 01:52:33,550
Do RDC a future of you guys doing on.

4142
01:52:33,720 --> 01:52:34,650
That's a lot.

4143
01:52:34,720 --> 01:52:35,740
That's what we're doing.

4144
01:52:35,770 --> 01:52:36,780
The 17th and 18th.

4145
01:52:36,790 --> 01:52:37,690
It has to be great.

4146
01:52:37,720 --> 01:52:38,570
We're doing Portland,

4147
01:52:38,590 --> 01:52:39,050
Seattle,

4148
01:52:39,050 --> 01:52:40,000
Ralph together.

4149
01:52:40,030 --> 01:52:40,271
Yeah,

4150
01:52:40,271 --> 01:52:40,780
man.

4151
01:52:40,780 --> 01:52:41,351
That's awesome.

4152
01:52:41,351 --> 01:52:41,621
Yeah,

4153
01:52:41,621 --> 01:52:42,430
dude,

4154
01:52:42,430 --> 01:52:43,263
it's going to be awesome.

4155
01:52:43,650 --> 01:52:44,081
See Ya.

4156
01:52:44,081 --> 01:52:46,310
This is silly conversation
and your dog Theo,

4157
01:52:46,340 --> 01:52:49,490
is now better is coming
with us and really bring.

4158
01:52:49,491 --> 01:52:49,820
Yes,

4159
01:52:49,820 --> 01:52:50,450
absolutely.

4160
01:52:50,450 --> 01:52:51,470
And um,

4161
01:52:51,680 --> 01:52:52,730
he is doing much better.

4162
01:52:52,760 --> 01:52:53,840
Thanks again for doing the show,

4163
01:52:53,841 --> 01:52:54,250
man.

4164
01:52:54,250 --> 01:52:55,070
That was awesome view.

4165
01:52:55,070 --> 01:52:55,221
Yeah,

4166
01:52:55,221 --> 01:52:56,210
that was really cool man.

4167
01:52:56,320 --> 01:52:56,781
Actually,

4168
01:52:56,781 --> 01:52:59,960
I met somebody from a bunch of people
from cartoon network because of that.

4169
01:52:59,990 --> 01:53:00,591
And Really?

4170
01:53:00,591 --> 01:53:01,070
Yeah.

4171
01:53:01,070 --> 01:53:01,431
What do you mean?

4172
01:53:01,431 --> 01:53:03,350
They were at the show here at
the show and they were like,

4173
01:53:03,380 --> 01:53:03,501
oh,

4174
01:53:03,501 --> 01:53:04,041
you were great.

4175
01:53:04,041 --> 01:53:05,090
And I'm ready.

4176
01:53:05,120 --> 01:53:07,730
Go checkout cartoon network
studios pretty soon.

4177
01:53:07,731 --> 01:53:10,370
And maybe possibly pitch an idea to them.

4178
01:53:10,520 --> 01:53:11,271
That's a good idea,

4179
01:53:11,271 --> 01:53:11,620
buddy.

4180
01:53:11,620 --> 01:53:13,400
Me and joe ideas as cats maybe.

4181
01:53:13,600 --> 01:53:14,433
Oh,

4182
01:53:17,630 --> 01:53:19,760
I'm uh,

4183
01:53:19,761 --> 01:53:24,761
I got to talk to you about doing some
shows that I think you would find fun.

4184
01:53:25,070 --> 01:53:25,903
Entertaining.

4185
01:53:27,100 --> 01:53:27,380
No,

4186
01:53:27,380 --> 01:53:27,711
dude,

4187
01:53:27,711 --> 01:53:30,020
I don't believe in rabbits that talk.

4188
01:53:30,110 --> 01:53:32,840
Dave rabbits talk had been
featured in many cartoons.

4189
01:53:32,841 --> 01:53:35,260
It's the stupidest shit you believe docs,

4190
01:53:35,261 --> 01:53:36,094
but you don't believe rabbits.

4191
01:53:36,100 --> 01:53:36,690
No,

4192
01:53:36,690 --> 01:53:37,340
that's silly.

4193
01:53:37,340 --> 01:53:37,701
Rabbits.

4194
01:53:37,701 --> 01:53:38,241
Don't talk.

4195
01:53:38,241 --> 01:53:39,074
The carrots.

4196
01:53:39,890 --> 01:53:40,131
Actually,

4197
01:53:40,131 --> 01:53:44,360
I was really stoned and I was reading
about who framed Roger Rabbit and how they

4198
01:53:44,361 --> 01:53:45,530
edited out all these,

4199
01:53:45,590 --> 01:53:46,730
like the artists,

4200
01:53:46,790 --> 01:53:47,060
like,

4201
01:53:47,060 --> 01:53:47,420
you know,

4202
01:53:47,420 --> 01:53:50,780
there's a scene where Jessica Rabbit pops
out of the taxi and you could see her

4203
01:53:50,781 --> 01:53:54,020
vagina and there's a few other scenes
where like a baby looks up address and

4204
01:53:54,021 --> 01:53:55,100
there's drool coming out of it.

4205
01:53:55,101 --> 01:53:55,761
The baby's mouth.

4206
01:53:55,761 --> 01:53:56,630
What's that guy's name?

4207
01:53:57,950 --> 01:53:59,760
Robert Fletcher.

4208
01:53:59,900 --> 01:54:00,560
No,

4209
01:54:00,560 --> 01:54:00,741
no,

4210
01:54:00,741 --> 01:54:01,040
no.

4211
01:54:01,040 --> 01:54:01,341
Oh No,

4212
01:54:01,341 --> 01:54:01,461
no,

4213
01:54:01,461 --> 01:54:01,750
no.

4214
01:54:01,750 --> 01:54:02,960
The opposite.

4215
01:54:03,470 --> 01:54:05,030
Jessica Rabbit I'm talking about.

4216
01:54:05,060 --> 01:54:05,880
Yeah.

4217
01:54:05,880 --> 01:54:06,713
The Guy Bob.

4218
01:54:07,300 --> 01:54:10,210
No haskins hoskins.

4219
01:54:10,300 --> 01:54:11,133
Bob Hoskins.

4220
01:54:11,390 --> 01:54:12,223
Bob Hoskins.

4221
01:54:12,830 --> 01:54:16,160
So then I found out that the only version
that you can find that part in the

4222
01:54:16,161 --> 01:54:17,690
movie is on a laser dispersion.

4223
01:54:17,810 --> 01:54:19,280
There's only one version of that laser.

4224
01:54:19,310 --> 01:54:21,290
This ebay and bought it for $4.

4225
01:54:21,291 --> 01:54:22,190
Do you have a laser player?

4226
01:54:22,220 --> 01:54:23,053
I do in Ohio.

4227
01:54:24,420 --> 01:54:26,240
Do you have to go back to Ohio to get it?

4228
01:54:26,241 --> 01:54:27,830
Just so I can see her vagina.

4229
01:54:28,400 --> 01:54:28,731
Where do you.

4230
01:54:28,731 --> 01:54:29,900
How do you buy a laser player?

4231
01:54:29,910 --> 01:54:31,450
Because it's not like a turntables.

4232
01:54:31,460 --> 01:54:32,293
We still have turned to.

4233
01:54:32,500 --> 01:54:33,190
Right.

4234
01:54:33,190 --> 01:54:36,700
It's like literally the ones that
are out there are the ones exist.

4235
01:54:36,830 --> 01:54:39,500
What's cool about the one I got
is I got this really high tech,

4236
01:54:39,501 --> 01:54:43,250
like five disc change changer slash
laser disc player and I was like,

4237
01:54:43,251 --> 01:54:46,400
this is like the best because it was on
clearance for some reason and then like

4238
01:54:46,430 --> 01:54:47,930
two months later DVD came out.

4239
01:54:47,931 --> 01:54:48,141
I was like,

4240
01:54:48,141 --> 01:54:48,770
oh goodbye.

4241
01:54:48,770 --> 01:54:51,710
Isn't it kind of fucked up
that the real sound people,

4242
01:54:51,711 --> 01:54:56,711
the sound freaks say that music played
over a record sounds the best laser.

4243
01:54:57,800 --> 01:54:58,850
This is better than DVD,

4244
01:54:58,851 --> 01:55:01,130
but yet everyone went
crazy on DVD a way better.

4245
01:55:01,131 --> 01:55:02,090
Is it better than blue ray though?

4246
01:55:02,240 --> 01:55:02,481
No,

4247
01:55:02,481 --> 01:55:03,111
it's not better in blue.

4248
01:55:03,111 --> 01:55:03,270
Right.

4249
01:55:03,270 --> 01:55:04,103
But

4250
01:55:04,910 --> 01:55:09,710
there's no argument that suck unless you
have a laptop made by apple who can't

4251
01:55:09,711 --> 01:55:11,000
work out a deal with Sony.

4252
01:55:11,350 --> 01:55:16,350
I just feel so weak when I see a fucking
Pcu or whip out his Bluetooth or Blu

4253
01:55:17,180 --> 01:55:17,270
Ray Bluetooth.

4254
01:55:17,270 --> 01:55:18,980
Look at the players are in the.

4255
01:55:18,981 --> 01:55:19,940
All the pc laptops,

4256
01:55:20,080 --> 01:55:20,630
a lot of pieces.

4257
01:55:20,630 --> 01:55:21,463
There's no laptop.

4258
01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:22,340
No.

4259
01:55:22,340 --> 01:55:26,630
None of the new apple fanboy saying none
of the laptops today have DVD players

4260
01:55:26,640 --> 01:55:28,520
in this because that's blue rights.

4261
01:55:28,530 --> 01:55:29,900
The only ones that don't are apple ones.

4262
01:55:30,010 --> 01:55:33,380
Well they're actually taking them
out of most laptops nowadays.

4263
01:55:33,440 --> 01:55:34,730
You take them out and wait,

4264
01:55:34,731 --> 01:55:35,570
why would you take him out?

4265
01:55:35,750 --> 01:55:36,590
Why would I take them out?

4266
01:55:36,620 --> 01:55:37,770
You take them out is you said no,

4267
01:55:37,780 --> 01:55:37,911
no,

4268
01:55:37,911 --> 01:55:38,051
no,

4269
01:55:38,051 --> 01:55:38,201
no,

4270
01:55:38,201 --> 01:55:38,381
no.

4271
01:55:38,381 --> 01:55:38,690
I didn't.

4272
01:55:38,690 --> 01:55:39,680
Laptops and laptops.

4273
01:55:39,681 --> 01:55:40,514
The laptops.

4274
01:55:40,640 --> 01:55:41,510
I'm not up on that,

4275
01:55:41,511 --> 01:55:44,070
but I did when I was at my
friend and the Google friend's

4276
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:44,730
house.

4277
01:55:44,730 --> 01:55:44,941
Um,

4278
01:55:44,941 --> 01:55:47,760
I did see the google laptop with
the chrome operating system.

4279
01:55:47,770 --> 01:55:49,350
I got to play with that touchscreen.

4280
01:55:49,560 --> 01:55:50,730
Touchscreen laptop.

4281
01:55:50,970 --> 01:55:51,211
Yeah.

4282
01:55:51,211 --> 01:55:52,500
But it's all non local.

4283
01:55:52,501 --> 01:55:54,110
Everything is stored in the cloud.

4284
01:55:54,130 --> 01:55:54,963
Horrible idea.

4285
01:55:55,360 --> 01:55:58,960
That's what supposedly the next xbox
is supposed to be where you don't buy

4286
01:55:58,961 --> 01:55:59,381
games.

4287
01:55:59,381 --> 01:56:00,640
All your games are on a cloud,

4288
01:56:00,760 --> 01:56:02,740
so you can only play if you
have an Internet connection,

4289
01:56:02,741 --> 01:56:04,300
which drives me fucking crazy.

4290
01:56:04,301 --> 01:56:05,350
Can you imagine sitting there going,

4291
01:56:05,590 --> 01:56:06,490
I just wanna play video games.

4292
01:56:06,640 --> 01:56:07,473
There's a storm.

4293
01:56:07,870 --> 01:56:08,703
What the fuck?

4294
01:56:09,270 --> 01:56:10,091
That's ridiculous.

4295
01:56:10,091 --> 01:56:10,790
You should be able to

4296
01:56:10,790 --> 01:56:11,780
play if you're camping,

4297
01:56:12,170 --> 01:56:12,490
camping.

4298
01:56:12,490 --> 01:56:13,640
He set up a generator.

4299
01:56:13,641 --> 01:56:17,030
You shouldn't have to hook a
fucking Internet connection
to it through your cell

4300
01:56:17,031 --> 01:56:17,390
phone.

4301
01:56:17,390 --> 01:56:18,223
No

4302
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:20,151
camping.

4303
01:56:20,151 --> 01:56:21,410
He can't get away from your xbox.

4304
01:56:21,960 --> 01:56:24,240
I'm such a second
generation guy for that too.

4305
01:56:24,241 --> 01:56:29,241
Like I like people to buy that first one
that needs all the work and then come

4306
01:56:29,311 --> 01:56:30,560
through in the second half of me,

4307
01:56:30,600 --> 01:56:31,230
my friend.

4308
01:56:31,230 --> 01:56:31,391
Yeah,

4309
01:56:31,391 --> 01:56:31,591
I know.

4310
01:56:31,591 --> 01:56:33,470
You got to get everything I can.

4311
01:56:33,490 --> 01:56:36,630
I love your dedication to seeing
the Jessica rabbit snatch.

4312
01:56:36,900 --> 01:56:37,411
One of the,

4313
01:56:37,411 --> 01:56:38,244
um,

4314
01:56:39,280 --> 01:56:40,140
one of the episodes

4315
01:56:40,160 --> 01:56:40,971
as of this new show.

4316
01:56:40,971 --> 01:56:45,971
I'm doing Isabelle computer simulation
theory and one of the things I'm doing is

4317
01:56:46,041 --> 01:56:50,540
I went down to a place
that makes computer games.

4318
01:56:50,541 --> 01:56:50,881
Like they,

4319
01:56:50,881 --> 01:56:51,161
they,

4320
01:56:51,161 --> 01:56:55,520
they actually do like three d scanning
and they scan my face and they're going

4321
01:56:55,521 --> 01:56:57,940
to put me in like this
fake game with a creative.

4322
01:56:57,970 --> 01:56:59,120
Oh wow dude.

4323
01:56:59,150 --> 01:57:00,230
Way to use this show.

4324
01:57:00,290 --> 01:57:00,711
This show is,

4325
01:57:00,711 --> 01:57:02,090
I'm getting to do so much cool shit.

4326
01:57:02,091 --> 01:57:04,610
And most of it I can't talk about
because I can't give away any secrets or

4327
01:57:04,611 --> 01:57:06,440
anything on any of the
things that we found out.

4328
01:57:06,860 --> 01:57:07,370
But uh,

4329
01:57:07,370 --> 01:57:08,300
it's so much fun.

4330
01:57:08,330 --> 01:57:12,590
It's been really interesting because
I'm getting to talk to all these experts

4331
01:57:12,890 --> 01:57:13,091
again,

4332
01:57:13,091 --> 01:57:15,020
getting to talk to all
these like interesting,

4333
01:57:15,050 --> 01:57:17,450
intelligent people and crazy people too,

4334
01:57:17,770 --> 01:57:18,380
you know,

4335
01:57:18,380 --> 01:57:20,750
it's been like a couple of months so far,

4336
01:57:20,870 --> 01:57:23,420
a couple of weeks around
there and a couple of weeks.

4337
01:57:23,421 --> 01:57:24,320
I've had so much fun.

4338
01:57:24,321 --> 01:57:24,770
Man.

4339
01:57:24,770 --> 01:57:28,040
I believe that 100 percent
in the simulation theory
it's getting worse and worse

4340
01:57:28,041 --> 01:57:28,490
and worse.

4341
01:57:28,490 --> 01:57:29,290
Why do you say that?

4342
01:57:29,290 --> 01:57:30,081
Like last night my,

4343
01:57:30,081 --> 01:57:31,490
I've been having problems with my website,

4344
01:57:31,491 --> 01:57:34,160
so I call a dream house who's my,

4345
01:57:34,190 --> 01:57:37,940
who serves it and it's like five in
the morning and this girl lives in

4346
01:57:37,941 --> 01:57:38,481
California.

4347
01:57:38,481 --> 01:57:42,710
She works from her house and she's just
helping me out and not to get your freak

4348
01:57:42,711 --> 01:57:43,070
on.

4349
01:57:43,070 --> 01:57:44,740
And it's kind of funny you said that.

4350
01:57:45,020 --> 01:57:45,770
So I,

4351
01:57:45,770 --> 01:57:46,490
uh,

4352
01:57:46,490 --> 01:57:47,180
I uh,

4353
01:57:47,180 --> 01:57:48,530
was watching this movie,

4354
01:57:48,550 --> 01:57:48,730
uh,

4355
01:57:48,730 --> 01:57:52,460
Tim and Eric's billion dollar movie and
letting a Taffeta no one's got time for

4356
01:57:52,461 --> 01:57:54,530
that in the movie.

4357
01:57:54,690 --> 01:57:56,390
They were in this mall and it's,

4358
01:57:56,391 --> 01:57:58,280
I always find like places
that have closed down,

4359
01:57:58,281 --> 01:57:58,840
interesting.

4360
01:57:58,840 --> 01:58:01,730
Like this whole mall is actually a
real model that's in palm springs and

4361
01:58:01,731 --> 01:58:02,210
whatever.

4362
01:58:02,210 --> 01:58:06,230
So I'm like researching this mall while
I'm on hold trying to get to talk to

4363
01:58:06,231 --> 01:58:06,980
this girl.

4364
01:58:06,980 --> 01:58:07,790
And uh,

4365
01:58:07,790 --> 01:58:10,910
I found out there was all these pictures
of this big Marilyn Monroe statute

4366
01:58:10,911 --> 01:58:14,290
where they took two parts
of Marilyn Monroe and put
it in front of this mall and

4367
01:58:14,340 --> 01:58:16,940
somehow it came up with Google search
and I'm just looking at this crazy

4368
01:58:16,941 --> 01:58:17,780
Maryland moreau thing.

4369
01:58:18,140 --> 01:58:18,650
Uh,

4370
01:58:18,650 --> 01:58:19,071
and then,

4371
01:58:19,071 --> 01:58:21,680
so I'm talking to this girl and uh,

4372
01:58:21,830 --> 01:58:25,340
the next day today I noticed that she
follows me on twitter or somebody from

4373
01:58:25,341 --> 01:58:27,800
dreamhost follows me on
twitter and who's a girl?

4374
01:58:28,010 --> 01:58:29,390
And she like writes me,

4375
01:58:29,391 --> 01:58:29,721
she's like,

4376
01:58:29,721 --> 01:58:30,800
you got somebody on your side,

4377
01:58:30,801 --> 01:58:33,470
I'm helping you out right now and I'm
checking in that may try to help your

4378
01:58:33,471 --> 01:58:34,230
website.

4379
01:58:34,230 --> 01:58:34,550
Right?

4380
01:58:34,550 --> 01:58:35,540
So direct message.

4381
01:58:35,630 --> 01:58:38,450
So I go through her photos
because see what she looks like.

4382
01:58:38,451 --> 01:58:38,750
One,

4383
01:58:38,750 --> 01:58:40,130
she's a pretty Asia and I'm like,

4384
01:58:40,131 --> 01:58:40,281
wow.

4385
01:58:40,281 --> 01:58:42,390
So you've started her
after she was falling.

4386
01:58:43,120 --> 01:58:44,500
So I went through and I'm like,

4387
01:58:44,501 --> 01:58:44,591
wow,

4388
01:58:44,591 --> 01:58:45,610
she's a pretty Asian girl.

4389
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:50,350
Like the fourth photo is her in front
of that fucking Maryland Mary Statue.

4390
01:58:50,570 --> 01:58:52,390
Never seen in my whole entire life.

4391
01:58:52,480 --> 01:58:54,040
And now this girl that's helping me out,

4392
01:58:54,041 --> 01:58:55,120
this Asian girl that's helping me out.

4393
01:58:55,170 --> 01:58:56,003
Andrea,

4394
01:58:56,270 --> 01:58:59,440
you guys get him therapy
together in the next picture.

4395
01:58:59,441 --> 01:59:00,730
If you backed up one further,

4396
01:59:00,731 --> 01:59:04,930
you'd see her finger yourself with
the desk while the whole time.

4397
01:59:05,920 --> 01:59:06,670
I hope so.

4398
01:59:06,670 --> 01:59:09,400
This whole time that she's actually
the one that hacked my computer.

4399
01:59:09,401 --> 01:59:11,020
Have you seen the pictures of Rhonda Rousy

4400
01:59:11,060 --> 01:59:11,690
with a desk while?

4401
01:59:11,690 --> 01:59:14,330
T shirt on the fucking coolest thing ever.

4402
01:59:14,331 --> 01:59:15,081
And that's very cool.

4403
01:59:15,081 --> 01:59:17,990
Seeing Ronda Rousey gives the thumbs up.

4404
01:59:18,020 --> 01:59:19,370
The baddest chick on the planet.

4405
01:59:19,371 --> 01:59:19,840
Yeah.

4406
01:59:19,840 --> 01:59:20,421
But by the way,

4407
01:59:20,421 --> 01:59:22,400
there's a lot of bad
ass chicks on a planet.

4408
01:59:22,590 --> 01:59:24,230
There's a gang of a man,

4409
01:59:24,231 --> 01:59:26,450
there's some skillful women out there,

4410
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:26,950
there.

4411
01:59:26,950 --> 01:59:27,830
So many of them.

4412
01:59:27,831 --> 01:59:32,660
This new fight that they have the new
episode of the ultimate fighter with this

4413
01:59:32,661 --> 01:59:35,990
girl cat Zingano and
Ronda Rousey together.

4414
01:59:36,260 --> 01:59:36,560
Uh,

4415
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:37,040
looking at it.

4416
01:59:37,040 --> 01:59:37,873
That's awesome.

4417
01:59:38,840 --> 01:59:40,010
So nice man.

4418
01:59:40,011 --> 01:59:41,420
She wants to come on
the podcast again too.

4419
01:59:41,480 --> 01:59:46,010
It's just going to be on somewhere
after the beginning of May.

4420
01:59:46,040 --> 01:59:47,600
We're going to look how bad ass she is.

4421
01:59:47,630 --> 01:59:49,370
She has a fucking bed in her kitchen.

4422
01:59:50,210 --> 01:59:51,320
That's the way to do it.

4423
01:59:51,670 --> 01:59:51,930
Yeah.

4424
01:59:51,930 --> 01:59:52,420
Well,

4425
01:59:52,420 --> 01:59:52,850
you know,

4426
01:59:52,850 --> 01:59:54,260
she probably lives in a studio.

4427
01:59:54,780 --> 01:59:55,730
I mean she,

4428
01:59:55,731 --> 01:59:57,350
this is probably the same place.

4429
01:59:57,350 --> 01:59:59,300
She's one of those tricks that
probably wants to keep it real too,

4430
01:59:59,950 --> 02:00:00,320
I think.

4431
02:00:00,320 --> 02:00:00,430
Well,

4432
02:00:00,430 --> 02:00:01,670
I don't want to say where she lives,

4433
02:00:01,671 --> 02:00:02,900
but she's awesome.

4434
02:00:03,110 --> 02:00:04,100
She'll be back here again,

4435
02:00:04,550 --> 02:00:08,060
but she's fighting a cat Zingano and
they're going to coach against each other

4436
02:00:08,061 --> 02:00:08,960
on the ultimate fighter.

4437
02:00:09,350 --> 02:00:11,960
And a cat Zingano just beat Miesha tate.

4438
02:00:12,440 --> 02:00:14,990
Who's another beautiful dangerous girl.

4439
02:00:15,230 --> 02:00:16,490
And Cat Zingano too.

4440
02:00:16,520 --> 02:00:19,490
They're all like pretty girls
that can beat the fuck out of you.

4441
02:00:19,491 --> 02:00:20,480
It's really kind of scary,

4442
02:00:20,990 --> 02:00:22,100
but this is in Gong.

4443
02:00:22,101 --> 02:00:23,740
Chick is I based man.

4444
02:00:23,741 --> 02:00:25,310
She's so bad ass.

4445
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:30,440
She sure and Misha tate fought and cheat
this combination that she finished her

4446
02:00:30,441 --> 02:00:30,681
with.

4447
02:00:30,681 --> 02:00:31,280
Dude,

4448
02:00:31,280 --> 02:00:32,113
pull it up.

4449
02:00:32,120 --> 02:00:34,340
Cat Zingano versus Misha tate.

4450
02:00:34,510 --> 02:00:34,780
The,

4451
02:00:34,780 --> 02:00:35,180
the,

4452
02:00:35,180 --> 02:00:36,410
the female fight.

4453
02:00:36,411 --> 02:00:36,651
Dude.

4454
02:00:36,651 --> 02:00:38,570
I was watching it and my
friend [inaudible] place,

4455
02:00:39,470 --> 02:00:42,410
the female fight was the
highlight of the room.

4456
02:00:42,830 --> 02:00:44,120
We were going crazy.

4457
02:00:44,300 --> 02:00:45,051
It was me,

4458
02:00:45,051 --> 02:00:47,700
my friend Aubrey and a
bunch of his buddies,

4459
02:00:47,701 --> 02:00:51,500
he had like five of his friends over
and we were eating Mexican food and

4460
02:00:51,501 --> 02:00:52,130
watching the fights.

4461
02:00:52,130 --> 02:00:53,480
Having a great fucking time,

4462
02:00:53,720 --> 02:00:57,260
but the room went nuts when
the meesha take cuts and in.

4463
02:00:57,280 --> 02:00:57,471
Oh,

4464
02:00:57,471 --> 02:00:58,400
fight was going down.

4465
02:00:58,730 --> 02:01:00,140
It was chaos.

4466
02:01:00,141 --> 02:01:01,820
These girls were going off on each other.

4467
02:01:01,821 --> 02:01:02,460
Dude,

4468
02:01:02,460 --> 02:01:03,650
it's seriously.

4469
02:01:03,770 --> 02:01:06,440
Might've been one of the most entertaining
fights I've ever seen in my life is

4470
02:01:06,441 --> 02:01:06,980
awesome.

4471
02:01:06,980 --> 02:01:07,970
You got to see the finished.

4472
02:01:07,971 --> 02:01:09,170
Just look up the finish.

4473
02:01:09,240 --> 02:01:13,760
The whole fight was great and you know
me should take him really close again or

4474
02:01:13,761 --> 02:01:14,720
in a heel hook.

4475
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:18,730
It was like dominant
grappling exchanges and yeah,

4476
02:01:18,790 --> 02:01:20,200
you don't want to watch
all this stuff now,

4477
02:01:20,910 --> 02:01:23,450
although the actual fight
parts that are cut off youtube,

4478
02:01:23,451 --> 02:01:24,740
but I think they have like highlights.

4479
02:01:24,770 --> 02:01:25,480
Oh yeah.

4480
02:01:25,480 --> 02:01:25,820
These,

4481
02:01:25,820 --> 02:01:27,740
this is sort of showing you the highlight

4482
02:01:29,580 --> 02:01:30,413
was working.

4483
02:01:31,190 --> 02:01:34,070
You don't have to play all this stuff
because I hope it doesn't get us

4484
02:01:34,240 --> 02:01:35,790
hold off of youtube or
something like that,

4485
02:01:36,210 --> 02:01:37,960
but I probably won't.

4486
02:01:37,990 --> 02:01:38,131
I mean,

4487
02:01:38,131 --> 02:01:38,370
I know.

4488
02:01:38,370 --> 02:01:41,120
Imagine it just do picture in
picture and you just show the video.

4489
02:01:41,300 --> 02:01:41,660
Yeah,

4490
02:01:41,660 --> 02:01:42,440
she beats.

4491
02:01:42,440 --> 02:01:43,880
They beat the fuck out of each other,

4492
02:01:43,881 --> 02:01:44,151
man.

4493
02:01:44,151 --> 02:01:45,050
It was nasty.

4494
02:01:45,170 --> 02:01:46,940
I mean it was like such a tightly,

4495
02:01:47,180 --> 02:01:51,170
tightly contested fight and really Misha
tate was probably getting the better of

4496
02:01:51,171 --> 02:01:52,340
it on the scorecards,

4497
02:01:53,180 --> 02:01:57,470
but the end of it hits her with that elbow
and drops her and referee Kim winslow

4498
02:01:57,530 --> 02:01:58,430
stops the fight.

4499
02:01:58,730 --> 02:01:59,930
She's a bad ass man.

4500
02:01:59,990 --> 02:02:00,970
Do you remember that?

4501
02:02:01,210 --> 02:02:02,043
Was like,

4502
02:02:02,250 --> 02:02:05,840
this is what excites me is it's
not that the girls anymore,

4503
02:02:06,100 --> 02:02:09,320
it's now they're like really
highly skilled fighters.

4504
02:02:09,321 --> 02:02:09,800
Yeah.

4505
02:02:09,800 --> 02:02:11,030
That not just women.

4506
02:02:11,280 --> 02:02:11,510
You know.

4507
02:02:11,510 --> 02:02:12,350
It's not just like,

4508
02:02:12,380 --> 02:02:12,680
hey,

4509
02:02:12,680 --> 02:02:13,550
girls can do it too.

4510
02:02:13,551 --> 02:02:13,851
It's like,

4511
02:02:13,851 --> 02:02:14,061
no,

4512
02:02:14,061 --> 02:02:15,830
these chicks are bad ass,

4513
02:02:16,030 --> 02:02:17,300
like they're not half fascinated.

4514
02:02:17,300 --> 02:02:18,260
They're all going for it.

4515
02:02:18,261 --> 02:02:18,740
Sure.

4516
02:02:18,740 --> 02:02:21,410
And now that Ronda
Rousey's become so famous,

4517
02:02:21,620 --> 02:02:24,590
it's like this is going to open the door
to so many female athletes that have

4518
02:02:24,591 --> 02:02:25,970
never even considered it before.

4519
02:02:26,120 --> 02:02:27,170
You started looking at it and you go,

4520
02:02:27,171 --> 02:02:27,591
you know what?

4521
02:02:27,591 --> 02:02:29,340
I was wanting to kick a bitches ass

4522
02:02:31,260 --> 02:02:31,530
rap.

4523
02:02:31,530 --> 02:02:32,060
I'm on.

4524
02:02:32,060 --> 02:02:32,721
It's going to happen.

4525
02:02:32,721 --> 02:02:33,130
Yeah.

4526
02:02:33,130 --> 02:02:34,800
A show starts in 15 minutes.

4527
02:02:34,801 --> 02:02:35,180
Just Siena.

4528
02:02:35,180 --> 02:02:36,110
Indeed it does,

4529
02:02:36,111 --> 02:02:36,581
Brian,

4530
02:02:36,581 --> 02:02:40,550
and we would know much better if you had
a fucking clock that was more accurate.

4531
02:02:41,270 --> 02:02:41,580
Oh,

4532
02:02:41,580 --> 02:02:42,413
silly bitch.

4533
02:02:43,040 --> 02:02:43,550
How dare you?

4534
02:02:43,550 --> 02:02:44,383
Silly Bitch.

4535
02:02:44,840 --> 02:02:46,700
I'm powerful.

4536
02:02:46,701 --> 02:02:47,534
Kittycat clock.

4537
02:02:48,380 --> 02:02:49,213
Tommy Sigora.

4538
02:02:49,610 --> 02:02:49,940
Yo,

4539
02:02:49,940 --> 02:02:50,773
you're the champ.

4540
02:02:50,930 --> 02:02:51,380
Thanks Randy.

4541
02:02:51,380 --> 02:02:53,330
One of the greatest humans on the planet.

4542
02:02:53,331 --> 02:02:53,670
And thanks.

4543
02:02:53,670 --> 02:02:54,090
Bye Sweetheart.

4544
02:02:54,090 --> 02:02:54,923
To Buddy.

4545
02:02:55,050 --> 02:02:55,370
Uh,

4546
02:02:55,370 --> 02:02:56,330
I'm honored to be a friend.

4547
02:02:56,390 --> 02:02:56,781
Me Too,

4548
02:02:56,781 --> 02:02:57,170
man.

4549
02:02:57,170 --> 02:02:57,951
You guys are the best.

4550
02:02:57,951 --> 02:02:58,970
I love coming on your show.

4551
02:02:59,000 --> 02:02:59,810
It's a lot of fun.

4552
02:02:59,810 --> 02:03:00,950
While we love you too as well,

4553
02:03:00,951 --> 02:03:02,300
my friend and uh,

4554
02:03:02,480 --> 02:03:04,010
together we are stronger.

4555
02:03:04,130 --> 02:03:04,700
We are,

4556
02:03:04,700 --> 02:03:05,151
we're like,

4557
02:03:05,151 --> 02:03:05,870
um,

4558
02:03:05,870 --> 02:03:07,580
Genghis Khan would take one arrow.

4559
02:03:07,660 --> 02:03:08,120
Okay.

4560
02:03:08,120 --> 02:03:09,440
And you bring it in
front of Truth and snap.

4561
02:03:09,441 --> 02:03:13,250
It may take a bundle of arrows
and he couldn't snap it.

4562
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:13,820
Yeah.

4563
02:03:13,820 --> 02:03:17,030
Just to let the troops know
together we are stronger together.

4564
02:03:17,031 --> 02:03:17,391
We are strong,

4565
02:03:17,391 --> 02:03:19,250
but divided we are weak.

4566
02:03:19,850 --> 02:03:20,683
That's true.

4567
02:03:21,260 --> 02:03:22,430
And I know we talked about,

4568
02:03:22,431 --> 02:03:24,600
I talked about this with you and I
talked about it with Christina a lot.

4569
02:03:24,650 --> 02:03:29,630
It was such a cool thing to have all of
you like just as friends come out and do

4570
02:03:29,631 --> 02:03:30,340
our,

4571
02:03:30,340 --> 02:03:31,640
our fundraiser for the dog.

4572
02:03:31,641 --> 02:03:33,920
It was just such a cool
feeling for us to be like,

4573
02:03:34,040 --> 02:03:37,550
have all this support of like you
guys as friends just wanting to do it.

4574
02:03:37,730 --> 02:03:39,170
And then the crowd that night was just,

4575
02:03:39,200 --> 02:03:39,710
you know,

4576
02:03:39,710 --> 02:03:40,341
they were magic.

4577
02:03:40,341 --> 02:03:42,130
They're magic guys.

4578
02:03:42,160 --> 02:03:42,290
Man.

4579
02:03:42,290 --> 02:03:42,711
It was awesome,

4580
02:03:42,711 --> 02:03:42,861
man.

4581
02:03:42,861 --> 02:03:43,431
We couldn't.

4582
02:03:43,431 --> 02:03:44,690
I couldn't love you anymore than I do.

4583
02:03:44,810 --> 02:03:45,560
You're awesome.

4584
02:03:45,560 --> 02:03:46,630
I really appreciate.

4585
02:03:46,640 --> 02:03:49,070
We really appreciate it and
we appreciate you too man.

4586
02:03:49,071 --> 02:03:49,461
You know,

4587
02:03:49,461 --> 02:03:49,731
look,

4588
02:03:49,731 --> 02:03:50,480
we're all lucky.

4589
02:03:50,480 --> 02:03:51,440
We're all lucky bitches.

4590
02:03:51,441 --> 02:03:53,270
We're all lucky that we know each other.

4591
02:03:53,271 --> 02:03:53,990
And uh,

4592
02:03:53,990 --> 02:03:55,010
we got a good group of evil.

4593
02:03:55,011 --> 02:03:56,570
We're going to keep this
party rolling freaks.

4594
02:03:57,040 --> 02:03:59,100
There was no commercial coming in.

4595
02:03:59,370 --> 02:04:01,140
There's none coming out.

4596
02:04:01,620 --> 02:04:02,453
Sockets.

4597
02:04:02,490 --> 02:04:03,323
Halachic boy,

4598
02:04:03,360 --> 02:04:05,710
Paula Jihadi.

4599
02:04:06,150 --> 02:04:07,230
Hi Krishna.

4600
02:04:07,260 --> 02:04:08,640
God bless Duncan trussell.

4601
02:04:08,850 --> 02:04:10,230
We love the fuck out of you all.

4602
02:04:10,320 --> 02:04:12,120
We all are one together.

4603
02:04:12,121 --> 02:04:12,810
One for all.

4604
02:04:12,810 --> 02:04:14,070
Something like Robin Hood said,

4605
02:04:14,130 --> 02:04:16,400
piece to the guy or girl.com.

4606
02:04:16,550 --> 02:04:17,520
