1
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:06,243
Okay.

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:07,753
We're good.
Yeah.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,500
Ladies and Gentlemen,
please welcome Peter Boghossian.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:11,760
Hello.
Thanks everybody.

5
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:12,880
Thanks for doing that.
Appreciate it man.

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:13,733
I good.
I think I found out about you through 

7
00:00:16,081 --> 00:00:17,730
Sam Harris.
I'm not sure,

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,090
but,
uh,

9
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,830
you're also friends with my friend rory 
singer.

10
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:20,611
Oh,
Roy,

11
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:21,750
he's a great guy.
Great Guy.

12
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,060
He got excited when he found out that 
you were coming on.

13
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,320
Roy,
of course,

14
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,490
uh,
martial artists,

15
00:00:26,491 --> 00:00:28,100
a former UFC fighter.
Right.

16
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,093
And,
uh,

17
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,400
kept me many times.
I'm sure he taught me many times too.

18
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,930
So you,
you're,

19
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,190
uh,
you,

20
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,150
you work at,
um,

21
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,300
University of Portland State,
Portland state.

22
00:00:39,301 --> 00:00:40,370
Yeah.
Work Portland state,

23
00:00:40,371 --> 00:00:45,220
teach philosophy there.
And you're also a guy who is your,

24
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,860
you described as an atheism advocate,
like not just an atheist,

25
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,620
but someone who actively promotes,
hey,

26
00:00:52,621 --> 00:00:54,390
you should probably try this.
Um,

27
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,930
I promote critical thinking and reason 
and rationality and I,

28
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,010
and the two go together.

29
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,233
Yeah.
And I think that naturally leads to to 

30
00:01:01,651 --> 00:01:03,600
atheism if people are honest with 
themselves.

31
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,300
And,
um,

32
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,270
and you know,
you mentioned rory.

33
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,223
Uh,
I've been a longtime martial arts my 

34
00:01:08,161 --> 00:01:09,690
whole life actually.
Really?

35
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,630
What did you start off with?
The fantasy based martial arts?

36
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,640
The bullshit.
Like which ones?

37
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,220
Uh,
I did everything.

38
00:01:17,221 --> 00:01:20,280
I mean I did,
I tried Kempo I tried,

39
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:21,683
I literally tried if you were to put all
of the emotional arts together that 

40
00:01:26,221 --> 00:01:28,890
don't work and put them into one suite,
I tried them,

41
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:30,323
all of them.
Well Campos got some good striking 

42
00:01:32,491 --> 00:01:34,320
techniques.
They just don't have a,

43
00:01:34,321 --> 00:01:36,990
an overall comprehensive system to deal 
with grappling.

44
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,350
Yeah,
I tried [inaudible] I tried taekwondo.

45
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:41,490
I tried,
uh,

46
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:45,420
I tried tai cheese so I tried them all.
And then I actually,

47
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,810
one of my turning points was when Ron 
van Cleef,

48
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,730
who was in the original UFC as early 
UFC,

49
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,910
he was in like ufc three or four or 
something like that early on.

50
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,760
And he was like in his fifties he was 
older.

51
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,890
He's in still in very good shape.
He,

52
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,753
he liked competed in a tournament,
a karate tournament I think deep into 

53
00:02:06,571 --> 00:02:08,280
his sixties.
Yeah,

54
00:02:08,281 --> 00:02:11,420
I trained with,
with Ron and I trained with this guy,

55
00:02:11,421 --> 00:02:12,254
she on Hector Santiago who was quite 
something and I trained with them for 

56
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:15,834
years in New York City.
And when Ron van cleef got taken down 

57
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:21,840
and just dominated,
that was a huge moment for me.

58
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,070
That was then I then that started me on 
this whole other path.

59
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,380
And then I trained with Greg Jackson for
New Mexico.

60
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,210
Will you in New Mexico?
Yeah.

61
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,610
W having there,
I've trained,

62
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,850
I started in New York City before the 
UFC came,

63
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:36,803
came along and I trained there and then 
I trained in New Mexico and now I train 

64
00:02:40,591 --> 00:02:43,410
with Matt Thornton from straight blast.
Uh,

65
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,253
his John Calvin,
ours coach who's obviously conor 

66
00:02:46,471 --> 00:02:48,860
mcgregor and,
and Nelson's that's,

67
00:02:48,861 --> 00:02:49,694
that's a great lineage man.
So you saw Ron van cleave get dominated 

68
00:02:54,511 --> 00:02:55,350
by hoists,
gracie?

69
00:02:55,351 --> 00:02:57,600
Yeah,
like fairly easily.

70
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,070
It was kind of interesting watch like a 
guy

71
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,820
who is this ledge really,
really well respected in the karate.

72
00:03:03,821 --> 00:03:05,600
We're whole legend.
Legend.

73
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,020
Smoked like a beginner.
Yeah.

74
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,680
And I saw those guys,
like I saw Hector Santiago fight in real

75
00:03:11,681 --> 00:03:12,514
life and he is a very dangerous person.
You saw him fight like in a street 

76
00:03:16,151 --> 00:03:18,370
fighter.
So I used to live in the lower east side

77
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:21,690
between a and B and a d.
So,

78
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,400
so all of this,
this was just part of my,

79
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,283
my experience and I thought a lot of 
this stuff was real and it just turned 

80
00:03:28,721 --> 00:03:31,110
out to be fantasy.
It just turned out to be make-believe.

81
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,790
Well,
I think that's an interesting parallel.

82
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:34,983
When we were talking before the podcast,
we're talking about critical thinking 

83
00:03:37,661 --> 00:03:40,510
and Brazilian Jujitsu and martial arts 
in general,

84
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:45,730
and there are a lot of people that have 
very distorted ideas of many things,

85
00:03:45,731 --> 00:03:48,280
not just of their ability to handle 
themselves physically,

86
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,230
but just of the world in general.

87
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:55,330
And I think martial arts sort of 
highlights a lot of that curriculum,

88
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,010
those critical thinking issues.
Yeah,

89
00:03:57,011 --> 00:03:57,844
and I think that's,
that's one of the reasons that I was so 

90
00:03:59,261 --> 00:04:03,400
excited to come on this podcast today is
because I think you are ideally situated

91
00:04:03,401 --> 00:04:07,390
to have it have that conversation with 
me because Jujitsu,

92
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,420
Brazilian Jujitsu,
specifically alive in his training,

93
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:14,740
training against resisting opponents,
we don't talk about,

94
00:04:14,741 --> 00:04:17,650
this is a huge area that nobody is 
talking about.

95
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:21,520
We can understand all of reason and 
rationality through Jujitsu,

96
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:22,383
through corrective mechanisms,
through aligning your beliefs with 

97
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:26,590
reality.
I mean little things from,

98
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,540
you know,
testing ideas yourself,

99
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:33,541
not having to take it on faith.
I just talking to 'em as talking to uh,

100
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:36,843
uh,
uh,

101
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,560
cause the name eludes me now.
I think,

102
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:43,240
I think that there's something Chris 
harder I think is super good guy.

103
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:43,780
Great Guy.

104
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,470
Yeah.
Yeah.

105
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,960
There's something in the process.
So,

106
00:04:46,961 --> 00:04:49,780
so you've been tapped thousands of 
times.

107
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,440
Sure.
Um,

108
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,273
probably if I counted them all up yet,
I've been tapped to do something about 

109
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,833
the type of person who would either if 
you frame it in terms of subjecting 

110
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:01,024
yourself to that,
there's something about that that's 

111
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,720
fundamentally differentiates us,
if you will,

112
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,570
from people in fantasy based martial 
arts.

113
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:11,643
It develops a kind of character,
develops a kind of attitude when you 

114
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:18,520
placed yourself in situations and get 
tapped.

115
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,450
It's,
it's a type of a corrective mechanism.

116
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,313
Jujitsu is a corrective mechanism.
It can help you align your beliefs with 

117
00:05:25,511 --> 00:05:26,410
reality.
And,

118
00:05:26,411 --> 00:05:27,244
and I,
I'd love to explore that with you today 

119
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,170
and talk about what that means just in 
the case that some people might not know

120
00:05:32,171 --> 00:05:34,380
what that means.
We mean by tap is submit.

121
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,340
Um,
when you do Jujitsu,

122
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:37,990
I believe it or not,
I've talked to,

123
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:40,330
I assume that people know what we're 
talking about,

124
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:41,800
but I've talked to people go,
okay,

125
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:44,020
what is Jujitsu?
Like what are you doing?

126
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,120
What?
Submission?

127
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:49,840
Grappling,
which has a Jujitsu is one style of it,

128
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,930
but it's all about using leverage and 
technique,

129
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,123
uh,
against joints or chokes against 

130
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,120
arteries like choke holds,
uh,

131
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,370
to cut off the blood to your brain or 
neck cranks.

132
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:06,640
And when you train Jujitsu as opposed to
other martial arts other than wrestling,

133
00:06:06,921 --> 00:06:09,080
which I consider martial art,
you can go full speed on that.

134
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,120
You Go,
you go 100%.

135
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,013
And that's the difference between those 
martial arts and striking based martial 

136
00:06:14,961 --> 00:06:15,794
arts where you really shouldn't go 100% 
because you only have so many punches 

137
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:23,480
your head can take before your body just
stops working.

138
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:28,550
That's just a fact.
You could train sparring hard for,

139
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,870
you know,
a certain amount of years,

140
00:06:29,871 --> 00:06:31,650
but you're gonna,
you're gonna,

141
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:34,310
you're mind is going to turn into mush.
There's just no doubt about it.

142
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:37,000
We know that for a fact.
And people do Jujitsu into their sixties

143
00:06:37,001 --> 00:06:37,970
and yeah.
Oh yeah.

144
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,470
Well Anthony Bordain didn't even start 
until he was 58 and he's obsessed.

145
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:43,603
He trains every day.
He goes sometimes twice a day I'll take 

146
00:06:46,341 --> 00:06:49,790
a private in the morning and then he'll 
train in a group class after that.

147
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,710
He's a maniac.
Um,

148
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,143
but the difference being like you 
absolutely know what works and doesn't 

149
00:06:56,331 --> 00:06:58,130
work and you absolutely know how good 
people are.

150
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,990
So if we rolled,
you can't fake it.

151
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:00,853
Yeah.
If we rolled 20 times and you tapped me 

152
00:07:02,241 --> 00:07:03,870
18 of those 20 times,
you know,

153
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,810
and if someone said,
how good is Peter?

154
00:07:05,811 --> 00:07:07,280
I'm like,
he taps me most of the time.

155
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,090
And then we know we have no,
they all,

156
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,330
you sit in that case.
But yeah.

157
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,193
Well,
you know what I'm saying?

158
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,420
We know it's clear.
Yeah.

159
00:07:14,421 --> 00:07:17,540
And so you can't fake it.
There's no pretending.

160
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,433
There's no bullshit.
But I know like bowing rituals and 

161
00:07:20,871 --> 00:07:21,704
masters and all this nonsense,
all of those structures I think are put 

162
00:07:24,921 --> 00:07:25,754
in place to conceal the underlying 
paucity of the effectiveness of the 

163
00:07:29,601 --> 00:07:32,060
techniques.
And people come up with this.

164
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:33,943
So the other thing about that that that 
I think is so important is that all of 

165
00:07:37,461 --> 00:07:38,294
these combat based martial arts,
I've been waiting for this conversation 

166
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:47,270
for all of those combat,
these combat based martial arts.

167
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,910
Let's take a look at,
you mentioned wrestling.

168
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:50,803
We know it works.
We know there are some things we just 

169
00:07:52,011 --> 00:07:54,830
know that they work.
We know the kickboxing works.

170
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,740
We also know that it's head trauma for 
kickboxing.

171
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:58,603
We know that Moitai,
which is in my opinion and insane 

172
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,360
activity,
but we know that it works.

173
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,110
We know that Western boxing works.
We know that Jujitsu works,

174
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:09,080
so the reason that we know we can test 
these things,

175
00:08:09,081 --> 00:08:09,914
we can take people and hopefully later 
on we'll talk about the difference 

176
00:08:13,671 --> 00:08:15,770
between Brazilian Jujitsu and Japanese 
Jujitsu,

177
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,730
right?
Same techniques,

178
00:08:16,731 --> 00:08:19,490
different pedagogy,
different training method.

179
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,880
That's a $2 word for training method.
We can take that.

180
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:23,743
We can adjudicate these things because 
we take two people of equal weight and 

181
00:08:26,601 --> 00:08:27,434
we stick them in a cage and we have some
very basic rules and also for your 

182
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:33,590
listeners who aren't from there,
mma gloves are very thin.

183
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,830
You know,
I think people who don't understand mma,

184
00:08:36,831 --> 00:08:38,900
they think that they're kind of like 
boxing gloves.

185
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:39,853
They are very,
very thin gloves that they don't afford 

186
00:08:42,111 --> 00:08:42,944
much protection at all.
Really led the person punch you harder 

187
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,760
so they don't have to worry about 
breaking their hand.

188
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,910
But as far as like cushion to your brain
or your head,

189
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,320
yeah,
they're not a cushioning.

190
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:52,400
Yeah.
So,

191
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,980
so we can look,
we can judge what works.

192
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,580
And the one of the ways that we do that 
is to people same size,

193
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,140
put them in a cage and we see what 
works.

194
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:05,850
The other thing is that when you train 
against a resisting opponent,

195
00:09:05,851 --> 00:09:10,851
and I think this is the key,
you can figure out what's real.

196
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,980
Like that's a mechanism.
It's a corrective mechanism.

197
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:16,440
It's a way for you to discern,
make,

198
00:09:16,441 --> 00:09:19,440
believe land and reality.
Bullshit,

199
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,513
reality.
You know,

200
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,920
w what,
what works and what doesn't work.

201
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,790
And once we start introducing that in 
systems like,

202
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,230
look,
let's say that I said to you,

203
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:29,520
Hey,
I've,

204
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,190
I've come up with this technique.
Uh,

205
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:35,070
I know this is going to sound crazy,
but it's incredibly effective.

206
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:35,940
And you say,
what is it?

207
00:09:35,941 --> 00:09:38,670
And I say,
it's a pinky blitz creek.

208
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:41,470
I got a lot like they're gonna use it.
And so I said this,

209
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,300
they said,
well,

210
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,290
attacking with pink.

211
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:43,850
Yeah.
I say,

212
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:44,820
you know,
but it's a certain,

213
00:09:44,821 --> 00:09:46,760
you know,
stance and I do this right.

214
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,450
You know,
come Bantus stance where,

215
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:49,920
and you said,
really?

216
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,500
And so you call up,
unbeknownst to me,

217
00:09:52,501 --> 00:09:53,460
you call up,
you know,

218
00:09:53,461 --> 00:09:54,294
like I heard her show you're buddies 
with Eddie Bravo right now he's called 

219
00:09:56,951 --> 00:09:57,784
me and say,
look,

220
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,870
we got this guy in here.
He says that he has this technique,

221
00:10:00,871 --> 00:10:04,200
p picky blitzkrieg I'm going to send 
them over there,

222
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,060
put them up against your good purple 
belt,

223
00:10:06,061 --> 00:10:07,650
getting on video and we'll see what 
happens.

224
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,320
So it's,
it's a way to test it now.

225
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:12,780
Now if that works,
you'd be like,

226
00:10:12,781 --> 00:10:14,430
Holy Shit.
Like I can't,

227
00:10:14,431 --> 00:10:15,590
this is awesome.
Like we,

228
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,900
nobody ever thought of the pinky 
blitzkrieg it's incredible.

229
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,573
But what you've done there is you,
that's a core component of critical 

230
00:10:24,331 --> 00:10:25,164
thinking.
It's a willingness to revise your 

231
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:27,624
beliefs.

232
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:28,703
It may sound like bullshit,
but you're completely open to the 

233
00:10:31,711 --> 00:10:32,544
possibility.
If this works against a resisting 

234
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:34,591
opponent,
right?

235
00:10:34,591 --> 00:10:38,310
So let's say that I tap out his tap out 
his,

236
00:10:38,311 --> 00:10:39,630
uh,
purple belts,

237
00:10:39,631 --> 00:10:40,201
and you're like,
all right,

238
00:10:40,201 --> 00:10:41,034
well,
Brown belt.

239
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,003
At some point,
it would be so absurd that you'd think 

240
00:10:44,461 --> 00:10:45,930
that Eddie and I were in on it,
right?

241
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,400
I don't know the guy,
I've never rolled them,

242
00:10:47,401 --> 00:10:49,080
never met him.
So He'd call someone else,

243
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,053
but,
and then you can test it so you can 

244
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:52,374
watch it.
Eventually you can test it with your 

245
00:10:53,371 --> 00:10:54,204
friends.
So this idea of testability and people 

246
00:10:56,311 --> 00:10:57,144
can figure out things for themselves.
They don't have to go on the history of 

247
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,390
the tradition.
You know,

248
00:11:00,391 --> 00:11:01,224
some guy punched a bull in the head or 
there was a blind nun walking through 

249
00:11:03,721 --> 00:11:04,554
this and she killed all these guys.
But that's when we always had to deal 

250
00:11:06,271 --> 00:11:07,104
with that was that was the history of 
martial arts was always muscle yama and 

251
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,090
killed a bull with a banshee.

252
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:13,320
We always hear about Maslow Yama.
Who was this?

253
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,290
Was He kilkee Shin or I think it was 
coke cushion.

254
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,790
Right?
So his lineage,

255
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:18,900
I don't,
I don't remember,

256
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:19,853
but he was a famous Japanese guy who 
apparently had killed a bull right 

257
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,300
punch.
Which,

258
00:11:24,301 --> 00:11:25,500
uh,
and then that,

259
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,130
that,
that,

260
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:28,410
that comes down as legends.
So when people said,

261
00:11:28,411 --> 00:11:28,801
well,
you know,

262
00:11:28,801 --> 00:11:30,840
how do you know this works?
Why should do it?

263
00:11:30,841 --> 00:11:32,160
Well,
this guy killed a bull.

264
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,590
Well,
did you see the bull did,

265
00:11:34,591 --> 00:11:35,590
did you see it?
So,

266
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:36,523
so it's uh,
it's a fable and the fable takes on a 

267
00:11:38,971 --> 00:11:41,030
life of its own.
And the,

268
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,123
the,
the genius about the ultimate fighting 

269
00:11:44,311 --> 00:11:47,940
challenge was then you had a way to test
ideas,

270
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,833
right?
You can literally watch these things 

271
00:11:51,721 --> 00:11:53,980
unfold against people of,
in

272
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,813
the early ones,
your people have different weight 

273
00:11:55,931 --> 00:11:56,764
classes.
They had the sumo wrestler and the 

274
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,570
kickboxing guy.
So,

275
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,463
but not only that,
it was an opportunity for you to figure 

276
00:12:04,871 --> 00:12:06,730
out what was real,
right?

277
00:12:06,731 --> 00:12:09,910
And there's something that's incredibly 
appealing to that.

278
00:12:09,911 --> 00:12:12,970
Like think about,
think about Kata,

279
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:16,030
right?
What a fucking waste of time.

280
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:21,210
Like not only is it a waste of time in 
terms of let's say what Kata is,

281
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,650
it's like,
you want to go.

282
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:24,521
Yeah.
And so it's,

283
00:12:24,521 --> 00:12:25,354
we'll their forms and what a form as 
it's like a pattern of movement that 

284
00:12:28,061 --> 00:12:29,290
you,
that everyone does.

285
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,060
You'd get one when you get your white 
belt,

286
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,160
you practice that and you get really 
good at it.

287
00:12:33,161 --> 00:12:35,110
You do it for a task to get your yellow 
belt.

288
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,510
And in a lot of traditional martial 
arts,

289
00:12:37,511 --> 00:12:39,800
that is part of how you test.
You know,

290
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:40,634
I,
I got my black belt in taekwondo and I 

291
00:12:42,611 --> 00:12:47,611
had to remember all those goofy moves 
and they never came into play ever.

292
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,890
When I competed they were,
there were no sort of nonsense.

293
00:12:50,891 --> 00:12:54,140
It was a waste of time.
And as soon as I did get my black,

294
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,320
I forgot all of them,
barely remember it.

295
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:58,203
It's a waste of time.
But I'd argue it's even worse than a 

296
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:05,050
waste of time.
If it were just a waste of time,

297
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:07,660
then you know,
you could have been staring at a wall,

298
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:12,160
but you thought that you were doing 
something to help you achieve a goal and

299
00:13:12,161 --> 00:13:12,994
the goal was to win a fight.
So you thought you were engaged in 

300
00:13:16,091 --> 00:13:17,740
activity,
that the whole,

301
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,760
there's no resisting opponent.
So when there's no resisting opponent,

302
00:13:21,761 --> 00:13:23,410
it's not a tea,
it's not testable.

303
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,270
You can't bring the tools of science 
too.

304
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,170
Right.
So,

305
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:32,050
so you thought you were engaging in 
activity that brought you closer to your

306
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,330
desired objectives,
but it didn't.

307
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,610
Here's the argument against that though.

308
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,773
The what it does do is it helps your 
precision movement and you could argue 

309
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,223
that learning how to execute these 
patterns in a very beautiful way shows 

310
00:13:49,031 --> 00:13:52,330
control and it,
and it shows precision movement.

311
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,970
They aren't,
the problem with it is that there's some

312
00:13:54,971 --> 00:13:57,790
of those movements that are completely 
ineffective like double knife,

313
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:01,840
hand block or thrusts,
knife hand thrusts is,

314
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,470
there's movements that are there,
the not applicable to mma.

315
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,573
But the concept behind it is actually 
something that a lot of really good 

316
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:13,420
mixed martial arts like Carlos condit or
even conor mcgregor are doing.

317
00:14:13,421 --> 00:14:15,700
They're doing a lot of like movement 
training.

318
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,833
And um,
although I don't think Kata is the best 

319
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,970
way to achieve those kinds of goals.
Yeah,

320
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:21,933
I think that there's something to be 
said for not just martial arts 

321
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,520
techniques,
but other things as well.

322
00:14:27,521 --> 00:14:32,521
Like Yoga I think is extremely effective
in enhancing your ability to,

323
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:34,503
um,
to control and manage your body in the 

324
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,223
movements.
All right.

325
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,460
She's a weird strength.
So we're on the same page.

326
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:43,120
So think about it.
I'd offer a constructive way to think of

327
00:14:43,121 --> 00:14:45,730
it like this.
So what you just said,

328
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:46,773
I don't know anything about basketball.
So I'm going to just use basketballs 

329
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:49,983
stamp.
There's a ball and a net and black eyes 

330
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:52,530
and then that's

331
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:53,410
the court.
So,

332
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,340
so,
so I'm like guys,

333
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,383
when when you think about basketball,
what you just described was a guy on a 

334
00:15:00,501 --> 00:15:03,110
court practicing a lay up over and over 
again.

335
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,330
I think a layup is like when you bounce 
it and you shoot,

336
00:15:05,331 --> 00:15:07,910
you don't know the law.
I don't know anything about basketball.

337
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,520
So I'm like your run up to the fan,
you run,

338
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,700
throw the ball and then whole and 
everybody gets crazy.

339
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,410
Okay.
But think about,

340
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,110
don't think about caught.
So you,

341
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,193
so I think thinking about caught to like
a layup in terms of precision is the 

342
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:22,700
wrong way to look at,
look at it.

343
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,840
Think about Catia as a layup without a 
basketball.

344
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,950
Think about the practice of basketball 
practice,

345
00:15:30,951 --> 00:15:34,280
quote unquote a basketball without a 
basketball.

346
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,361
Right.
Okay,

347
00:15:35,361 --> 00:15:37,610
here's the problem with that.
What about shadow boxing?

348
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,453
Shadow boxing is extremely effective and
shadow boxing in a sense is a form of 

349
00:15:42,381 --> 00:15:47,180
Kata shadow boxing and w including not 
just boxing but kicking and punching and

350
00:15:47,181 --> 00:15:51,080
needing is a long,
long excepted.

351
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,930
Excellent form of training and 
visualization.

352
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,770
Yeah.
So,

353
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:57,880
so one of the things that shadow boxing 
you can do,

354
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:01,010
you can warm up was shadow boxing.
When I,

355
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:04,760
when I woke up in Git and just to be 
upfront,

356
00:16:04,761 --> 00:16:05,594
I,
I suck.

357
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,880
I've been doing it for a long time,
but I'm not very good.

358
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,070
I just felt or I love it.
Blue Belt.

359
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,930
So I'm not how long you've been doing.
I'm not,

360
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,620
I'm tell you it'd be ambassador.
Tell me since 1999 how dare you,

361
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:17,850
you're still a blue belt.
Um,

362
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:20,810
how often do you do it?
Well only once a week if I'm lucky.

363
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,793
Oh,
okay.

364
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,290
You gotta go Anthony Bourdain's tag.
You got to get obsessed.

365
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:25,363
Yeah.
I just don't have a lot of 

366
00:16:26,121 --> 00:16:26,954
opportunities.
Like I have a family that I pushed 

367
00:16:28,581 --> 00:16:29,414
forward.
I have a work career and I have either 

368
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:32,270
you have a life,
a life.

369
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,850
Yeah.
I'm fucking people with their lives.

370
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,870
Yeah.
So you know I'm not,

371
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,020
I'm not speaking about it from any kind 
of like,

372
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,460
you know,
I'm an expert in this.

373
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:41,743
I understand what you're saying.
But I think what's interesting about 

374
00:16:43,491 --> 00:16:46,390
this is the philosophical implications.
And so like,

375
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,383
like when I woke up,
I like to warm up with another body to 

376
00:16:49,251 --> 00:16:50,480
slow roll,
you know,

377
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:53,330
I like to just,
because then I have an opponent.

378
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,940
If you're practicing something over and 
over again,

379
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,030
the problem with that is there's no 
corrective mechanism.

380
00:16:59,150 --> 00:16:59,983
You could be doing the technique 
incorrectly and then when you actually 

381
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:03,554
go to execute it,
you've had a body memory for that 

382
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:07,880
technique that hasn't,
that's been,

383
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,773
that's taking you away from your goal.
Do you mean with striking you mean mean 

384
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,090
shadowbox and when you use these samples
shadowboxing,

385
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,640
just so you're saying with shadow boxing
that you,

386
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,130
you need another body in order for it to
be effective.

387
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:20,390
No,
I'm saying that like,

388
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:23,270
so let's say that you shadow box a 
hammer punch.

389
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:25,550
Okay,
so stuff that doesn't work like Catia,

390
00:17:25,551 --> 00:17:28,450
things like double knife hands.
If you,

391
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,353
even if you,
if you a shadowbox jabs and crosses and 

392
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:35,180
upper cuts and stuff,
even if you do that,

393
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:37,003
if you could not be doing it correctly 
and then you'd be practicing the wrong 

394
00:17:41,751 --> 00:17:46,460
thing over and over again and that will 
take you away from your goal.

395
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,353
That's why you need,
you have to have some kind of a 

396
00:17:48,771 --> 00:17:50,370
resisting opponent.
Resisting

397
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:54,540
opponents are the corrective mechanisms 
for everything and just as the,

398
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,970
they're the correct of mechanisms in the
physical domain.

399
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:57,943
Did the corrective mechanisms in the 
cognitive and intellectual domains as 

400
00:18:00,301 --> 00:18:03,750
well.
That's why prayer is so insidious.

401
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,793
It's because people think that they're,
they're doing something that's in their 

402
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:10,080
own wellbeing.
They're doing something that's good,

403
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,153
but they're just talking to themselves.
But there is some aspects and I would 

404
00:18:15,931 --> 00:18:17,560
agree with,
I don't know if I would,

405
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,430
I don't like labels.
I have a real hard time with labels,

406
00:18:20,431 --> 00:18:21,264
even labels for things that I think are 
good things like I think that some 

407
00:18:28,681 --> 00:18:33,480
people get a lot out of prayer and not 
necessarily because they're praying to a

408
00:18:33,481 --> 00:18:34,314
nonexistent deity or they really truly 
believe that if they wish for a new car 

409
00:18:38,521 --> 00:18:39,354
it's going to come to them,
but I think that the mind when focused 

410
00:18:43,771 --> 00:18:48,760
on positive thinking and and and focused
on love and focused on that,

411
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,673
the tenants of Christianity let go of 
God godly behavior and compassion and 

412
00:18:55,021 --> 00:18:55,854
all these different things and you truly
are looking out for your fellow man and 

413
00:18:59,131 --> 00:19:00,270
wanting to be a good person.

414
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,640
All those things.
I think there is merit in that.

415
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:04,080
I think you can,
you can,

416
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:08,250
you can certainly find benefit in that 
as a tool for mental management.

417
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,113
I mean does that mean there's a guy in 
the clouds with a harp and all that 

418
00:19:10,801 --> 00:19:12,120
jazz?
Of course not,

419
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,560
but I think that it's in a sense like 
like Tai Chi.

420
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,733
I mean,
if a guy thinks that he's going to take 

421
00:19:18,361 --> 00:19:21,590
Tai Chee only and get into the UFC,
uh,

422
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,490
it's hilarious.
He's going to get fucked up.

423
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,970
But if a guy in the UFC,
like conor mcgregor for instance,

424
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:31,500
who's so concentrated on movement really
gets involved in Tai Chi,

425
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,513
I think he would probably get at least 
some benefit out of it because in that 

426
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:41,150
slow moving,
this like rhythmic pattern,

427
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,323
what you're doing is you're exercising 
your body in an unusual way and 

428
00:19:46,171 --> 00:19:49,590
expanding the possibilities of,
of your,

429
00:19:49,591 --> 00:19:51,390
your,
your interactions with opponents,

430
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:53,850
expanding what your body can and can't 
do.

431
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:54,683
And I think yoga does that.
I think there's a lot of different 

432
00:19:56,191 --> 00:19:57,850
things.
So we need that.

433
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:01,260
There are about 20 really interesting 
things that you just said.

434
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,930
I think we need to kind of unpack those 
a little bit.

435
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:04,853
Like,
so if you talk about you to take a look 

436
00:20:07,531 --> 00:20:09,840
at prayer and what people think that 
they're doing,

437
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:13,770
and then let's,
this is why you're the perfect person is

438
00:20:13,771 --> 00:20:15,370
talking to this about,
uh,

439
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:19,500
then compare that to a martial art.
That's bullshit,

440
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,570
right?
Like Tai Chi is a good example.

441
00:20:21,571 --> 00:20:22,404
Okay,
so people think that they're going 

442
00:20:24,301 --> 00:20:27,750
towards a certain end winning fights.
It's certainly,

443
00:20:27,751 --> 00:20:31,560
I don't know about now anymore,
but certainly some people that teach Tai

444
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,140
Chi and even practice Tai Chi that are 
just doing it for their health.

445
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:35,640
Yeah.
My Dad is one of those people,

446
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,180
so he has zero ambitions to win a fight 
with anybody.

447
00:20:39,181 --> 00:20:43,080
He's in his late seventies so if 
somebody says that,

448
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:48,430
I have no problem with that at all and I
think it's true in Mo motion

449
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,263
would be better than non motion and the 
prom is exactly the same problem with 

450
00:20:52,841 --> 00:20:55,030
religion.
When people are making objective claims,

451
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:55,893
they're making claims about the nature 
of reality and I want to know what's 

452
00:21:00,251 --> 00:21:04,180
true and we don't even,
the problem is that people,

453
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:05,014
every time you talk about faith,
the religion or have you people shut 

454
00:21:07,271 --> 00:21:09,400
down or they have barriers,
we don't need to talk about that.

455
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,293
All we need to do is talk about Jujitsu.
That's why this is so perfect because 

456
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:17,350
with Jujitsu you can figure things out 
yourself with,

457
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,570
you can figure out what works,
right?

458
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,970
The pinky blitzkrieg you can figure out 
what doesn't work.

459
00:21:21,971 --> 00:21:23,710
You can figure out what you're capable 
of.

460
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,150
If,
if I tap you,

461
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,880
if,
if you tap me out 20 times,

462
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:30,640
I'm under no illusions that the 21st 
time,

463
00:21:30,641 --> 00:21:32,020
I mean I could get lucky,
you know,

464
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:34,870
like I could get lucky against rory,
I could get lucky against Matt Thornton.

465
00:21:34,871 --> 00:21:38,950
It's always possible I could get,
it's highly unlikely,

466
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,173
but I could get lucky.
The problem is that if you look at the 

467
00:21:44,771 --> 00:21:47,740
way that people engage these rituals in 
their lives,

468
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:48,963
what these people are doing is it,
they think it's taking them towards an 

469
00:21:51,881 --> 00:21:52,714
end.
It's exactly identical to fantasy based 

470
00:21:55,691 --> 00:21:56,524
martial arts.
They think it's taking them towards an 

471
00:21:58,631 --> 00:22:00,550
end.
It's not right.

472
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:06,070
I think also a parallel like in fantasy 
based martial arts,

473
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,060
the benefits of it.
Like

474
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,490
I was,
like I said,

475
00:22:09,491 --> 00:22:10,324
I did taekwondo for a long time and uh,
I got really good at it and then 

476
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,030
competed a lot.
And uh,

477
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,490
I was essentially in a cult.
I mean,

478
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,280
taekwondo a,
although it's a beneficial called and it

479
00:22:21,281 --> 00:22:22,114
helped me a lot and it made a lot of 
ways and made me the person that I am 

480
00:22:24,281 --> 00:22:25,114
today because in training and doing 
really difficult things and competing 

481
00:22:28,601 --> 00:22:31,540
and overcoming nerves and all that 
stuff,

482
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:33,610
there's a lot of benefit in it.
But then,

483
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,533
um,
I had a distorted perception of reality 

484
00:22:36,641 --> 00:22:39,160
because of it.
And that distorted perception of reality

485
00:22:39,161 --> 00:22:42,040
was shattered once I started boxing.
Exactly.

486
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:43,900
And I realize like,
oh my God,

487
00:22:43,901 --> 00:22:45,700
I was getting punched in the face.
I didn't know.

488
00:22:45,701 --> 00:22:48,460
I thought I knew how to fight when 
really I just knew how to do taekwondo.

489
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:49,323
Right.
And then I had to learn all the other 

490
00:22:50,891 --> 00:22:51,880
aspects of martial arts.

491
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,970
Like one of the most sobering moments of
my life was when I,

492
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,510
I trained at Carlson Gracie's in,
um,

493
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,250
on,
on Hawthorne,

494
00:23:00,251 --> 00:23:05,080
in Hollywood in 1996.
And this is before Vito Belfort made his

495
00:23:05,081 --> 00:23:07,150
debut in the UFC.
And,

496
00:23:07,151 --> 00:23:08,080
uh,
I,

497
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,910
you know,
I had this long,

498
00:23:09,911 --> 00:23:10,744
extensive history of competing and 
taekwondo tournament and I had kicked 

499
00:23:13,911 --> 00:23:15,490
boxed and,
uh,

500
00:23:15,491 --> 00:23:18,850
I'd done quite a bit of a boxing 
training and a,

501
00:23:18,851 --> 00:23:19,684
I wrestled in high school.
I thought it was pretty good martial 

502
00:23:21,311 --> 00:23:26,311
artist and I just got fucking mall.
So like I had never exercised.

503
00:23:27,851 --> 00:23:28,684
Like I had no idea what I was doing.
And I just remember the feeling of 

504
00:23:31,721 --> 00:23:33,520
helplessness and the guy who,
one of the,

505
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:34,960
I mean,
a bunch of people mauled me,

506
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,670
but one of the guys at mauled me I'll 
never forget,

507
00:23:36,671 --> 00:23:40,360
is this Brazilian kid who was a purple 
belt who was basically my size.

508
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:41,403
He wasn't any bigger than me.
And he wasn't like some Super Mario 

509
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,930
Sperry blackbelt guy.
Yeah.

510
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:46,070
He

511
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,290
was just some guy just beat the fuck out
of me.

512
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,393
I mean,
he's almost disdainfully and he was a 

513
00:23:51,021 --> 00:23:51,860
nice guy,
but I mean,

514
00:23:51,861 --> 00:23:52,694
when he was training,
he was training really hard and he 

515
00:23:53,871 --> 00:23:56,450
didn't give me any slack.
It was just getting wrecked.

516
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,460
And I remember thinking,
wow,

517
00:23:58,461 --> 00:24:00,830
what a stupid illusion I was under.
Yeah.

518
00:24:00,831 --> 00:24:01,400
And,
and,

519
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,310
and so in a sense,
I think it's,

520
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:06,493
I mean,
I guess that's a question we could talk 

521
00:24:07,131 --> 00:24:07,964
about,
but I know is it incumbent upon us to 

522
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:12,110
help people out of these traditional 
martial arts?

523
00:24:12,111 --> 00:24:14,360
Like I did a,
I had a very similar experience.

524
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,030
I trained in stick a knife fighting for 
years.

525
00:24:17,031 --> 00:24:19,100
That's why my hands cuts.
Yes.

526
00:24:19,101 --> 00:24:22,760
Grima that's why my my hands have all 
these cuts and are all married with real

527
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:24,320
knives,
real knives and sticks.

528
00:24:24,321 --> 00:24:25,154
Yeah.
I did the stuff with the dog brothers 

529
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:26,714
and Dan Medina was,
I've got a black belt and stick a knife 

530
00:24:29,031 --> 00:24:30,700
fighting and,
and you know,

531
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,860
I'm thinking about black belts and 
sticking a knife.

532
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:33,820
Yeah.
Yeah.

533
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:34,431
Okay.
Well,

534
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:35,264
I mean,
if you're in a place where the bullets 

535
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:38,150
are all gone and no one knows how to 
make a gun,

536
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,460
well,
bows and arrows haven't been invented.

537
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:41,900
That's where I was going to go with 
this.

538
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,970
Where I was going to go with this is I,
I,

539
00:24:43,971 --> 00:24:45,680
uh,
so I thought it was a pr like you,

540
00:24:45,681 --> 00:24:47,110
I thought I was pretty good martial 
artist.

541
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,530
Right.
And then,

542
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:52,730
uh,
I fought a guy fight,

543
00:24:52,731 --> 00:24:57,170
actually great Jackson with sticks and 
just beat the shit on them.

544
00:24:57,171 --> 00:24:58,004
And I mean I had a stick and I had been 
training with the stick for like years 

545
00:24:59,991 --> 00:25:03,080
at that point.
And it was just a huge wake up call from

546
00:25:03,081 --> 00:25:07,710
you guys fought like in the competition 
we fought in like a fight fight and,

547
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,980
and I,
he had only on fight fight.

548
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,510
You were mad at each other?

549
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:12,680
No,
like uh,

550
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:15,140
you know,
like a party's arm to the submission.

551
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:16,730
I mean we were like,
I was not,

552
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,160
so it was a competition?
Well No,

553
00:25:19,161 --> 00:25:23,440
it was at his old place and this is when
I started training with him and we,

554
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,493
I think we put on like very light hockey
gear and I was just going to beat the 

555
00:25:27,321 --> 00:25:29,200
shit out of him.
I was just going to,

556
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:30,203
yeah,
well that was my goal cause he said he 

557
00:25:32,271 --> 00:25:33,104
based,
this was before I learned about a 

558
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,230
liveliness training and and you know,
resisting.

559
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,000
That's the lifeness.
Yeah.

560
00:25:38,001 --> 00:25:40,350
So that's like Matt Thornton to me and,
and,

561
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:44,510
and it's a combination of,
that's a whole other discussion.

562
00:25:44,511 --> 00:25:45,590
It's like,
um,

563
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:47,300
timing,
energy and motion,

564
00:25:47,301 --> 00:25:48,134
resisting opponents,
ways to figure out what's true and what 

565
00:25:50,451 --> 00:25:52,220
works.
And I,

566
00:25:52,221 --> 00:25:53,054
uh,
this gets back to our discussion about 

567
00:25:55,281 --> 00:25:57,830
shadow boxing and about training other 
ways.

568
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,693
I had trained with a stick and I had 
known all of these kind of basically 

569
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:01,543
this caught to things,
but I also trained against a willing 

570
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:07,090
opponent.
Like when you watch these stick demos,

571
00:26:07,091 --> 00:26:10,280
the key to to look for is what the UK 
does.

572
00:26:10,281 --> 00:26:11,390
The feeder,
you know,

573
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:13,190
it's not what the guy does.
UK,

574
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:16,910
I think this is a Japanese word for like
the guy who's feeding in,

575
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:17,953
you know,
like,

576
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:18,521
oh,
okay,

577
00:26:18,521 --> 00:26:21,760
so the guy who is,
I do this and that people,

578
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,390
most of the people are listening to 
this.

579
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:27,290
It's like probably 90%,
even though a lot of watching it.

580
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,273
So what,
what you're demonstrating for those who 

581
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,460
are listening is like,
there's,

582
00:26:31,461 --> 00:26:32,750
um,
these live,

583
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,793
these drills that you do where someone 
will pretend to throw a punch gifts so 

584
00:26:35,991 --> 00:26:39,560
the person will step aside and do their 
counter attack and it looks awesome.

585
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,800
So the UK guy has it.
Got We in taekwondo,

586
00:26:41,801 --> 00:26:43,350
he used to call it the one steps.
Yeah.

587
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:44,010
The one steps.

588
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,080
Yeah.
And,

589
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:46,003
and it's,
it's a great example of a fantasy based 

590
00:26:47,851 --> 00:26:51,690
martial art because it makes you,
it brings you further from reality.

591
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:54,810
It makes you think you can do something 
that you simply cannot do.

592
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,183
So what you need to do in those 
circumstances is you need to watch the 

593
00:26:59,581 --> 00:27:01,890
feed or the person who's giving the 
reverse punch.

594
00:27:01,891 --> 00:27:03,510
It's like punched that comes off of 
your,

595
00:27:03,511 --> 00:27:04,344
I'm trying to be caught a punch that 
comes off of your ribs and goes out and 

596
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,580
they almost never hit somebody.
Like if,

597
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:15,150
if you watched the Steven Seagal when he
got his black belt as a famous black and

598
00:27:15,151 --> 00:27:18,900
white video that's out there and Jamie 
can link to it,

599
00:27:18,901 --> 00:27:19,840
I guess.
Uh,

600
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,500
it looks awesome,
but it's bullshit.

601
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:25,050
It's all choreographed.
The kido.

602
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:25,860
Yeah.
So,

603
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,693
so the,
the key deliverable I think in this 

604
00:27:29,401 --> 00:27:30,234
call,
one of those in this conversation is 

605
00:27:31,141 --> 00:27:35,730
that whether it's shadow boxing or 
whether it's Kata or whether it's taking

606
00:27:35,731 --> 00:27:36,900
a knife and doing a drill.

607
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,210
When I used to do those train with 
sticks,

608
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,370
I was really,
really good.

609
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:44,400
But I always knew the angle.
So it was fantasy based.

610
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,850
If you took the angle out of it,
I would just get beaten to death.

611
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,410
I mean peeps,
I'm,

612
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:49,243
what do you mean by angle?
So like in disrobed or scream or there 

613
00:27:51,901 --> 00:27:56,480
are 12 angles.
It goes 99 it goes like 75 degrees,

614
00:27:56,481 --> 00:27:58,410
35 degrees the other way.
Baseball swing,

615
00:27:58,411 --> 00:27:59,670
reverse baseball,
swing,

616
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:01,770
stab,
overhand stab,

617
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:04,530
tack to the knees,
attack to the other needs.

618
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,140
So when you do,
when you do those,

619
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,400
when you train,
you guys just do the numbers one,

620
00:28:11,401 --> 00:28:12,990
two,
three and you know,

621
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,600
you get so good at it.
I mean it's pretty crazy.

622
00:28:15,601 --> 00:28:16,620
I can show your stuff here.
You know?

623
00:28:16,621 --> 00:28:19,260
It's like if I know the angle,
it looks awesome.

624
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,640
I've seen guys do it.
It looks pretty bad ass,

625
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,793
but it's bullshit.

626
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,533
It's bullshit.
It's fantasy based martial arts because 

627
00:28:26,041 --> 00:28:29,400
the opponent isn't resisting.
You have to have a resisting opponent.

628
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,413
But here's the deliverable for this 
conversation I think is that if you 

629
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:37,950
train in a certain way,
absent to corrective mechanism,

630
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:42,090
but you think that corrective mechanism 
is an actual corrective mechanism.

631
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,013
In other words,
you think you're training in a way that 

632
00:28:44,251 --> 00:28:45,084
will bring you closer to reality,
but you're becoming further from 

633
00:28:47,701 --> 00:28:52,140
reality.
What that does is that takes that,

634
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:55,800
that's just a,
that's devastating because you need that

635
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:56,634
corrective mechanism.
You need to bring your thoughts in 

636
00:28:58,561 --> 00:28:59,394
alignment with reality.
And that was the great thing about the 

637
00:29:02,131 --> 00:29:06,510
UFC is because now we have all these 
people and we can see what works.

638
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:09,130
So think about the guys.
You know I,

639
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:12,780
I listened to your show that he bravo 
are I think,

640
00:29:12,781 --> 00:29:13,321
and he said,
you know,

641
00:29:13,321 --> 00:29:17,900
he was just practicing the,
the rear naked on his leg from,

642
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,773
well that's not gonna work because 
there's no corrective mechanism because 

643
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:21,930
I don't think you understand what you're
saying.

644
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,033
Well maybe I wasn't,
he was exercising his squeeze on his 

645
00:29:24,811 --> 00:29:25,770
leg.
He still does it.

646
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:28,200
And it's because one of the things about
Jujitsu,

647
00:29:28,201 --> 00:29:29,034
about finishing a technique is how hard 
can you squeeze and how long can you 

648
00:29:33,391 --> 00:29:34,224
squeeze.
So what Eddie does is he'll do this 

649
00:29:35,671 --> 00:29:37,050
like,
well if we're watching TV together,

650
00:29:37,051 --> 00:29:38,580
he'll do it.
He puts his knee up.

651
00:29:38,581 --> 00:29:39,414
If we're watching the fights,
who put his knee up like this and he'll 

652
00:29:41,501 --> 00:29:42,040
rear naked,

653
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,873
choke his own knee and just squeeze it.
And what he's doing is he's working on 

654
00:29:46,271 --> 00:29:47,104
it,
squeeze and it's not thinking that 

655
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:53,770
that's going to make him get to that 
position where he can squeeze someone.

656
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,673
Okay.
Well the or against a live resisting 

657
00:29:56,231 --> 00:29:57,160
opponent.
He's,

658
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,390
it's an exercise.
Okay.

659
00:29:58,391 --> 00:29:59,980
So that's cool.
So if,

660
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:02,560
if the idea then is that we'll work on 
your squeeze,

661
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:04,600
then that's different from thinking 
that,

662
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:06,190
that if,
if I,

663
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,530
if I,
if I train,

664
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:08,463
if you practice,
think about like practicing shadow 

665
00:30:10,211 --> 00:30:13,960
boxing and you're to use your example 
and your hook is always,

666
00:30:13,961 --> 00:30:14,610
you know,
wide,

667
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:17,890
you stand here and then when you get 
into a fight,

668
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:20,830
if you deal with a resisting opponent 
and you do that,

669
00:30:20,831 --> 00:30:21,664
so you would have,
you would have gone down a path to make 

670
00:30:23,711 --> 00:30:26,020
you worse than are,
but that's assuming that you're doing it

671
00:30:26,021 --> 00:30:26,800
incorrectly.

672
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,633
If you train correctly and you learn the
techniques correctly and then you apply 

673
00:30:30,701 --> 00:30:34,150
them in your shadow box and correctly 
it's going to benefit.

674
00:30:34,151 --> 00:30:34,990
Yeah.
Okay.

675
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,240
So that's the question that the question
is,

676
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:38,723
and I mean the,
the great thing about this conversation 

677
00:30:41,051 --> 00:30:42,490
is that we can test this stuff,
right?

678
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:46,180
I mean this is the ultimate we have,
we have people we have,

679
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,433
so for that we need to look at the,
the only big word I think we need here 

680
00:30:51,611 --> 00:30:53,740
today is pedagogy.
Like at the training method,

681
00:30:53,741 --> 00:30:55,790
it's a big word for training method.
We don't even need pedagogy.

682
00:30:55,791 --> 00:30:56,624
Just say training method.
So we look at the training method and 

683
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:03,850
what I think you would need for that is,
well actually I guess here's my question

684
00:31:03,851 --> 00:31:08,851
to you.
Would it be better in your mind to train

685
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:09,783
shadowboxing or to do some light boxing 
with guys with focus middle over there 

686
00:31:15,341 --> 00:31:19,190
at guys holding up focus Mitts at the 
same speed that you were shadowboxing?

687
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:21,580
This is where I think the conversation 
is going on,

688
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:24,160
right?
It's not that it's better.

689
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:28,960
All those things have their merits.
Shadowboxing has its merit.

690
00:31:28,961 --> 00:31:31,480
Yoga has its merit.
Yoga is not going to teach you how to be

691
00:31:31,481 --> 00:31:32,314
a a better fighter,
but if you learn all the techniques of 

692
00:31:35,081 --> 00:31:37,810
Jujitsu and you incorporate yoga into 
your training,

693
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,680
it will likely elevate your Jujitsu.
There's,

694
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,533
I have absolutely no question that 
that's true and I think that that goes 

695
00:31:44,441 --> 00:31:46,170
along with shadow boxing.
If you're,

696
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,013
especially if you're a striker,
if you're a striker and you don't 

697
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:50,123
shadowbox,
I think you're doing yourself a 

698
00:31:51,221 --> 00:31:52,054
disservice.
I think there is a benefit to a 

699
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:57,700
visualization and to movement.
And two,

700
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:58,563
there's,
there's things that happen when you 

701
00:31:59,891 --> 00:32:02,750
throw combinations in the air.
Um,

702
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:07,830
as far as you are dexterity,
especially with kicking and your ability

703
00:32:07,991 --> 00:32:12,991
to even do combinations without any 
resistance or without anybody,

704
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,360
um,
uh,

705
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:16,120
trying to counter you,
there's,

706
00:32:16,121 --> 00:32:19,930
there's benefit in stringing together 
those reps,

707
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,260
those repetitions.
Yeah.

708
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,390
Yeah.
Okay.

709
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:26,140
So I think there is a benefit of that.
And I think so sometimes if I,

710
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:30,070
if I go in to straight blast and there's
nobody on the mat,

711
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:30,933
there's no way to roll with,
sometimes what I'll do is I'll just go 

712
00:32:32,801 --> 00:32:35,470
through the motions.
Like I'll do roles or I'll do go over my

713
00:32:35,471 --> 00:32:37,210
back shoulder or I'll just,
you know,

714
00:32:37,211 --> 00:32:40,130
fall down.
There's

715
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:42,590
merit,
there's merit to that in that,

716
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:46,430
um,
I think I already know how to do it.

717
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:47,323
I mean I'm sure sure that I could 
improve on it without any question at 

718
00:32:51,171 --> 00:32:52,004
all.
Is so like your example of yoga is a 

719
00:32:55,191 --> 00:32:58,280
really good one.
I think it's certainly true that you can

720
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:02,060
use muscles and yoga that you don't,
and another activity.

721
00:33:02,061 --> 00:33:06,050
And I think that those have benefits to 
mma.

722
00:33:06,051 --> 00:33:06,884
In fact,
I'm sure they have benefits to a lot of 

723
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:08,871
other things.
So,

724
00:33:08,871 --> 00:33:12,800
so the not just the flexibility aspect 
and the body maintenance,

725
00:33:12,801 --> 00:33:15,140
there's a lot of good things to it.
Yeah.

726
00:33:15,141 --> 00:33:18,410
I don't do it myself.
I probably should,

727
00:33:18,411 --> 00:33:19,244
but if I would,
I'd just spend that hour and doing 

728
00:33:19,941 --> 00:33:20,774
Jujitsu to be blunt with you.
But I think that you can get things out 

729
00:33:24,261 --> 00:33:27,050
of yoga and get things out of these 
other activities,

730
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:31,430
but you have to be conscious about the 
reason why you're doing these things and

731
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,520
the way to get better ultimately like,
yeah,

732
00:33:34,521 --> 00:33:37,400
so you could shadow box at a certain 
level.

733
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:39,200
Um,
and again,

734
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:40,950
I guess I think we can think about it 
at,

735
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,710
in terms of the layup example,
again,

736
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:47,810
it's not necessarily the lay the ball is
the corrective mechanism with the layup.

737
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:50,270
The person is the corrective mechanism 
and the fight.

738
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,403
And as long as somebody knows what 
they're doing and their training in a 

739
00:33:54,171 --> 00:33:56,570
certain way,
it's not necessarily that shadowboxing,

740
00:33:56,850 --> 00:34:00,560
we'll take one away from one school if 
it's being practiced correctly.

741
00:34:00,561 --> 00:34:03,170
I think Carta would take one away from 
one school,

742
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:06,680
but I think that the whole project,
like if you think about,

743
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,490
and that's why I think the shadow boxing
is such a good example of this.

744
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:17,800
What is it that that w okay,
so when someone's shadow boxes,

745
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:18,643
the,
the point is to warm up that 

746
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,920
accomplishes that.
You could do that with squats to right.

747
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:25,400
And someone or you know,
you could do that in any one of a number

748
00:34:25,401 --> 00:34:26,840
of,
you're looking at me like you're lost.

749
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:27,733
No,
no,

750
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,370
that was all in your head,
man.

751
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,270
I just ain't got,
I got,

752
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,820
I got that look like we're just talking 
about,

753
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,251
no,
no,

754
00:34:41,251 --> 00:34:42,660
I'm just listening.
Yeah.

755
00:34:42,661 --> 00:34:44,640
Well if you think I'm,
if you think I'm off track,

756
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:45,900
let me know.
Uh,

757
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:49,790
you might be a little off track.
Um,

758
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:50,723
in that I think you think there's very 
little benefit and a lot of these 

759
00:34:53,761 --> 00:34:56,820
activities that I think a aren't primary
activities.

760
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:57,601
I think,
yeah,

761
00:34:57,601 --> 00:34:59,400
if you wanted to break it down to what 
is the only,

762
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:03,600
see there's just this broad range of 
things you can do,

763
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:07,590
you could do to improve all sorts of 
athletic endeavors.

764
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:08,663
Like there's a lot of people that don't 
believe you should do any strength and 

765
00:35:10,351 --> 00:35:11,184
conditioning training.
You should just do technique and you 

766
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:14,844
should just do sparring.
There's a lot of people that go that 

767
00:35:17,101 --> 00:35:19,080
route.
And then there's other people that think

768
00:35:19,081 --> 00:35:21,420
that's absolutely foolish you should 
primary like,

769
00:35:21,421 --> 00:35:24,060
especially once you learn the skills you
should,

770
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:24,923
if you're competing,
you should focus primarily on strength 

771
00:35:27,361 --> 00:35:28,194
and conditioning because really it's 
just about burning your body out and 

772
00:35:30,781 --> 00:35:34,650
reaching an incredibly high level of 
cardio so that when you compete,

773
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:35,573
you know all these techniques already,
you will now a gas tank that's superior 

774
00:35:38,491 --> 00:35:40,770
to your opponents and that will lead to 
victory.

775
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:44,220
Like there's a lot of modalities and 
there's a lot of schools of thought.

776
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:47,190
Can we talk for a sec?
Can we talk about that for a sec?

777
00:35:47,191 --> 00:35:48,900
Sure.
So it's interesting to me.

778
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:52,590
I see guys who come in who,
uh,

779
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,483
who are just super strong.
And I think to a certain extent we need 

780
00:35:57,541 --> 00:36:00,270
to be careful because strength,
and again,

781
00:36:00,271 --> 00:36:01,830
I'm not speaking from experience so 
much,

782
00:36:01,831 --> 00:36:02,664
I'm speaking of just conceptually.
I think there's a tendency for strong 

783
00:36:06,361 --> 00:36:11,310
guys or big guys to overlay upon their 
strengths or size small man Jiu Jitsu is

784
00:36:11,311 --> 00:36:14,070
the best to just tell people if they're 
thinking about learning.

785
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:17,340
Jujitsu learned from a little person 
because little guys,

786
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:20,280
you know,
boiler Gracie or even Eddie Bravo before

787
00:36:20,281 --> 00:36:22,950
he started lifting weights that he's 
quite a bit bigger now,

788
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,260
but Eddie was always like,
you know,

789
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:26,370
150 pounds,
140 pounds.

790
00:36:26,371 --> 00:36:28,980
So what he was rolling,
he would always be rolling with big guys

791
00:36:28,981 --> 00:36:30,870
and he had to rely on perfect technique.

792
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,620
Whereas a guy like Frank Mir,
who's a very large man,

793
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:38,100
has a lot of physical strength and they 
rely on that.

794
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,720
Yeah.
And I think,

795
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,160
well,
you tell him what you think.

796
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:46,200
Do you think that if somebody goes in 
strong and they focus on that often that

797
00:36:46,651 --> 00:36:49,050
that can come at the expense of learning
techniques?

798
00:36:49,051 --> 00:36:49,591
Yes,
it can.

799
00:36:49,591 --> 00:36:50,424
But here's the problem,
the concept of strength and 

800
00:36:51,511 --> 00:36:52,440
conditioning.
A lot of people think,

801
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:54,330
oh well you're doing squats and dead 
lifts.

802
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:57,600
Um,
a good example is a guy I've had on this

803
00:36:57,601 --> 00:36:59,600
podcast before.
His name is Nick Khorsandi,

804
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:00,463
Trans Hofeld Osan Joe see trains a 
Russell and providing the cough was a 

805
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,030
frame famous boxer,
but a lot of world class athletes.

806
00:37:06,031 --> 00:37:08,550
Joe Schilling,
who's a glory to shirt,

807
00:37:08,551 --> 00:37:10,740
I'm wearing a one of their uh,
best fighters,

808
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:11,603
excellent kickboxer world champion.
What he's doing is his strength and 

809
00:37:15,031 --> 00:37:15,870
conditioning program.

810
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:20,870
He trained under Marvin Marinovich and 
nick does a lot of plyometric exercises,

811
00:37:21,241 --> 00:37:22,074
a lot of sprinting,
a lot of box jumps and all these really 

812
00:37:24,931 --> 00:37:25,764
unorthodox techniques.
And the idea is to improve your ability 

813
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:29,874
to execute things,
improve your ability to close the 

814
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:32,874
distance and includes your,
improve your ability to get out of the 

815
00:37:35,341 --> 00:37:40,200
way and prove your ability to maintain a
high workload through the rounds.

816
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:41,970
You know,
like if you can only throw,

817
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:44,100
uh,
let's say 50 kicks in,

818
00:37:44,101 --> 00:37:44,934
around before you get exhausted,
and if you can improve that through 

819
00:37:47,671 --> 00:37:48,870
strength,
strength and conditioning,

820
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:49,733
make it 75 or 80,
you're going to have a significant 

821
00:37:51,721 --> 00:37:54,480
advantage over the pace that you can 
push on your opponent.

822
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:59,190
And that is in his opinion and many 
other people's opinion.

823
00:37:59,191 --> 00:38:00,024
And this is,
this is a really open debate right now 

824
00:38:02,431 --> 00:38:06,300
in the world of martial arts because it 
has not been solved because it relies on

825
00:38:06,301 --> 00:38:07,140
so many variables.

826
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:10,680
It relies on the athlete themselves,
their mental fortitude,

827
00:38:10,681 --> 00:38:13,150
their dedication to their craft.
Um,

828
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,153
how good is their technique in the first
place before they embark on a trunk 

829
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,293
strength and conditioning program?
There's so many variables I think to 

830
00:38:20,911 --> 00:38:22,650
unbox all this.
Um,

831
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:24,690
and to make it a little bit easier for 
people that are going,

832
00:38:24,691 --> 00:38:25,524
what the fuck are they talking about?
What we're saying is there's a lot of 

833
00:38:28,141 --> 00:38:33,141
people that have distorted ideas about 
reality itself and a method for exposing

834
00:38:36,311 --> 00:38:37,144
that kind of thinking,
which is like this sort of dogmatic 

835
00:38:43,931 --> 00:38:44,764
religious thinking,
which is ultimately accepted by all the 

836
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,320
people around you,
but never,

837
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:52,710
never critically judged.
Yeah.

838
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:58,450
A really good method is Jujitsu and the,
the meaning,

839
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,613
the reason why Jujitsu is such a good 
method is because Jujitsu is one of the 

840
00:39:02,741 --> 00:39:07,110
few martial arts that you could practice
at any age and you could apply to.

841
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:07,983
And you could also watch those 
techniques being applied by other 

842
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:11,471
people.
And when,

843
00:39:11,471 --> 00:39:14,050
you know,
gigit like yesterday I went to the Eddie

844
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:14,883
Bravo invitational,
which was at the orpheum theater in 

845
00:39:16,451 --> 00:39:20,320
downtown La,
some of the best Jujitsu fighters in the

846
00:39:20,321 --> 00:39:21,580
world.
We're going at it.

847
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,830
Uh,
and it was really amazing to watch.

848
00:39:23,831 --> 00:39:25,550
It was awesome.
And it was a,

849
00:39:25,551 --> 00:39:26,384
a crowd filled with thousands of people 
who are fans of Jujitsu and 

850
00:39:29,021 --> 00:39:31,570
practitioners.
So it was really educated crowd.

851
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:32,643
And what was cool about that is we all 
understood like when the guy got to a 

852
00:39:36,521 --> 00:39:37,240
position like,
oh,

853
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:37,481
blah,
blah,

854
00:39:37,481 --> 00:39:37,721
blah,
blah,

855
00:39:37,721 --> 00:39:38,590
blah.
And you know,

856
00:39:38,591 --> 00:39:39,424
the crowd would cheer when someone would
get out of a heel hook or they would 

857
00:39:42,071 --> 00:39:45,880
cheer when a guy would be able to tap a 
guy with a rear naked choke.

858
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,340
And we were watching all these things 
play out.

859
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,173
So there was lessons for me as a,
as someone who's not competing as 

860
00:39:52,931 --> 00:39:53,764
sitting in the audience,
because I've spent so much time doing 

861
00:39:56,051 --> 00:39:58,900
Jujitsu,
I was watching this sort of,

862
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,033
these interactions take place in a very 
logical truth seeking truth seeking 

863
00:40:04,841 --> 00:40:06,070
community.
Exactly,

864
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,213
exactly.
I mean,

865
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,130
when the techniques work,
the techniques work.

866
00:40:09,131 --> 00:40:09,964
And by the way,
what's interesting is Brazilian Jujitsu 

867
00:40:13,301 --> 00:40:17,830
as it was first created,
or a first sort of established came from

868
00:40:17,831 --> 00:40:20,950
Japanese Jujitsu and Elio Gracie and 
Carlos Gracie,

869
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,023
who were probably two of the most 
important people ever in the history of 

870
00:40:24,251 --> 00:40:26,020
martial arts.
They,

871
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:27,423
they sort of manipulated those 
techniques and improved upon them and 

872
00:40:30,881 --> 00:40:31,714
made the art more about the submissions 
than it was about the stand up and the 

873
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:39,070
bringing the fight to the ground.
And in doing so,

874
00:40:39,071 --> 00:40:41,920
they established a series of techniques 
and you know,

875
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:42,773
we,
we refer to those techniques as the 

876
00:40:43,901 --> 00:40:44,734
basics.

877
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,133
There are some people in that world that
think that the basics are all you need 

878
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:52,720
and they don't accept the new 
techniques.

879
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:53,973
And it's really fascinating because 
that's essentially how Jujitsu became 

880
00:40:57,161 --> 00:41:00,970
effective in the first place is because 
the new techniques that were established

881
00:41:00,971 --> 00:41:04,090
by Carlos and Elio,
Gracie and all these different movements

882
00:41:04,091 --> 00:41:04,924
like the guard,
like learning how to do triangles off 

883
00:41:06,521 --> 00:41:07,690
your back,
all these different things,

884
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:08,703
which people had no idea.
And the early UFC like Royce gracie 

885
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:12,280
tapped out,
dan severn,

886
00:41:12,281 --> 00:41:13,690
everybody's like,
what the fuck is he doing?

887
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:16,000
He's got his legs wrapped around his 
neck and his arm.

888
00:41:16,001 --> 00:41:16,834
What is this?
And then Dan's about to go out and he 

889
00:41:18,611 --> 00:41:20,230
taps and everybody's like,
whoa,

890
00:41:20,231 --> 00:41:23,770
this is crazy.
Well those were in our world,

891
00:41:23,771 --> 00:41:24,604
completely new techniques.
Well there's a lot of new techniques 

892
00:41:26,861 --> 00:41:27,694
that are constantly being established 
now by these young innovative 

893
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:35,060
practitioners and that some of the old 
guard are ignoring.

894
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:38,510
And the real question is,
is that smart?

895
00:41:38,511 --> 00:41:43,130
Do you just need the basics?
And it's a hot debate right now.

896
00:41:43,131 --> 00:41:45,560
But again,
this hot debate can be proven.

897
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:47,020
That's exactly what I was going to say.
Yes,

898
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:51,320
that's exactly right.
And if as a result of this being proven,

899
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:52,183
somebody doesn't change their mind.
So the core piece that what's really 

900
00:41:58,101 --> 00:41:59,480
important is belief,
revision,

901
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:01,850
critical thinking is all about,
I made a mistake.

902
00:42:01,851 --> 00:42:02,960
I was wrong.
I thought this,

903
00:42:02,961 --> 00:42:03,794
you know what,
I,

904
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,330
I,
I made a mistake.

905
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,193
And so if they don't do that,
then they're somehow deficient in that 

906
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,860
attitude and disposition of critical 
rationality,

907
00:42:12,861 --> 00:42:13,694
you know,
they,

908
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:17,720
but it would seem to me if it could be 
demonstrated,

909
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:20,330
people who want to seek the truth in 
this case,

910
00:42:20,331 --> 00:42:22,460
they want to win against a resisting 
opponent.

911
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:23,990
Some,
some would,

912
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:26,810
some would accept the data,
but many haven't.

913
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:29,780
And my good friend Eddie Bravo is a 
perfect example of that.

914
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:30,793
I went with Eddie to Brazil in 2003 and 
he competed in the world championships 

915
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:36,030
and he beat,
um,

916
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,360
Gustavo Dante,
who was a world champion at the time.

917
00:42:38,361 --> 00:42:39,194
He tapped him in his first fight.
And then after that he fought boiler 

918
00:42:42,111 --> 00:42:42,944
Gracie,
who was one of the greatest Brazilian 

919
00:42:44,961 --> 00:42:48,890
jujitsu competitors of all time.
Hoya gracie's a national hero.

920
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:49,873
They closed the other mats off.
They put a spotlight on the main event 

921
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:56,060
and they thought they thought that 
Heuler was going to wreck this young kid

922
00:42:56,061 --> 00:42:57,470
who wasn't even a black belt at the 
time.

923
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,700
Eddie was a brown belt.
Okay.

924
00:42:59,150 --> 00:42:59,983
And Eddie with his unorthodox techniques
that people had laughed at tap toilet 

925
00:43:03,771 --> 00:43:06,200
gracie in front of everybody and he got 
him with the triangle,

926
00:43:06,201 --> 00:43:08,420
but he got up the setup was his rubber 
guard set up.

927
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:10,760
He has all these crazy guards set ups 
and you know,

928
00:43:10,761 --> 00:43:12,620
his game has advanced light years since 
then.

929
00:43:12,621 --> 00:43:15,770
But the point being that people mocked 
him for that,

930
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:17,450
it didn't help that he went to his next 
fight.

931
00:43:17,451 --> 00:43:21,380
He fought Leo Vieira and he popped his 
rib early in the fight and got dominated

932
00:43:21,381 --> 00:43:22,214
in that fight and almost got tapped.
But he know there was also a giant 

933
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:28,370
emotional let down because he couldn't 
believe he just tapped toilet gracie.

934
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:31,460
And now,
now he's moving on and he's fighting Leo

935
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:33,830
Vieira,
who's another monster,

936
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:34,940
Brazilian Jujitsu,
ours.

937
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:38,450
But there's a point for the longest time
people,

938
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:39,493
there was two schools of thought.
There was the old guard that just did 

939
00:43:42,051 --> 00:43:44,270
not accept him.
They openly mocked him.

940
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:45,251
And you know,
the,

941
00:43:45,251 --> 00:43:47,870
the really criticized his whole movement
and his,

942
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:49,580
his techniques,
what champions is,

943
00:43:49,581 --> 00:43:50,414
he produced all this.
This doesn't really work on real 

944
00:43:51,711 --> 00:43:56,230
fighters until he had a rematch with 
boiler many years later and just wrecked

945
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:56,690
him.

946
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:57,290
I mean,
it was,

947
00:43:57,290 --> 00:44:00,710
it was worse than the first time because
heuler didn't tap,

948
00:44:00,711 --> 00:44:02,600
but he got his knee destroyed.
I mean,

949
00:44:02,601 --> 00:44:03,434
if you watch that video who are just 
deals with the fact that his knees 

950
00:44:06,171 --> 00:44:08,750
getting ripped apart while Eddie's 
mangling it,

951
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:12,020
but it was never a moment where Eddie 
was in trouble.

952
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:17,140
He dictated the entire match.
And we played the fight on,

953
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:18,410
uh,
on the TV,

954
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,580
on a,
on a podcast.

955
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:20,563
And had Eddie explained what he was 
doing and even when it looked like 

956
00:44:22,881 --> 00:44:23,714
horror,
Lou was improving the position and he 

957
00:44:25,311 --> 00:44:25,701
was like,
no,

958
00:44:25,701 --> 00:44:27,960
I let him do that.
So I could do this and then I'll,

959
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:29,950
then I would adjust and he was like 
explaining,

960
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:32,070
I pulled him back on top of me because

961
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:36,000
I knew if I did that I would be able to 
move his arm higher up on my shoulder.

962
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:36,983
Then I rolled him back over onto his 
back and then I can get deeper in on 

963
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:43,110
when he was explaining that it was even 
more humiliating.

964
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,210
Because you've got this guy who earlier 
Gracie,

965
00:44:45,211 --> 00:44:46,044
who has a multiple time world champion 
who just did not learn these new 

966
00:44:49,531 --> 00:44:50,364
techniques,
feels like she's got these old 

967
00:44:52,321 --> 00:44:55,140
techniques and that's it.
So this is the application.

968
00:44:55,141 --> 00:44:55,974
That's exactly right.
And if you don't learn it and if you're 

969
00:44:57,421 --> 00:44:59,790
not willing to revise your beliefs and 
if you're not looking,

970
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:03,060
if you're not willing to test this and 
accept the conclusion,

971
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:04,563
you know,
you might think something's common 

972
00:45:05,671 --> 00:45:08,220
sense.
Common sense is irrelevant.

973
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:10,500
What's relevant is what works.
Yeah.

974
00:45:10,501 --> 00:45:13,560
Well these new techniques that are 
constantly being innovative,

975
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:14,423
they're constantly changing.
Like it's almost impossible to stay up 

976
00:45:16,771 --> 00:45:17,604
on all of it unless it's a monster part 
of your life and you're absorbing him 

977
00:45:20,721 --> 00:45:21,554
every day.

978
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:26,550
Like the leg lock game is this new 
element that over the last few years has

979
00:45:26,551 --> 00:45:30,480
really come into play in a major way.
Thanks to a bunch of guys,

980
00:45:30,481 --> 00:45:31,151
John,
Donna,

981
00:45:31,151 --> 00:45:32,100
her,
Eddie Cummins,

982
00:45:32,101 --> 00:45:35,070
Gary Tone and who won the Eddie Bravo 
and invitation only yesterday.

983
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:36,263
These like really high level 
practitioners and instructors are 

984
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:44,040
constantly adding new improvements to 
approaches and techniques.

985
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:48,090
So it's all a applicable,
it's all you can watch it happen in real

986
00:45:48,091 --> 00:45:48,924
time.
And even as someone who's not competing 

987
00:45:50,341 --> 00:45:51,174
like me sitting in the audience,
I understand the positions and the 

988
00:45:53,131 --> 00:45:53,964
movements.
So when I see all this new stuff and I 

989
00:45:55,561 --> 00:45:57,030
see all these new approaches,
it's like,

990
00:45:57,031 --> 00:45:57,864
wow,
this game just continues to grow and 

991
00:45:59,401 --> 00:46:00,230
evolve.
Yeah,

992
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:03,390
and w what amazes me is when I watched 
kids classes,

993
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:04,463
kids are doing the craziest stuff.
I mean they really have stood on the 

994
00:46:07,111 --> 00:46:10,560
shoulders of giants and they're doing 
stuff that's just so advanced.

995
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,120
And I look at that now and I think,
wow,

996
00:46:12,121 --> 00:46:14,740
it's like speed.
Even great thing.

997
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:19,880
How quickly these techniques and this 
game has been advanced in a very,

998
00:46:21,271 --> 00:46:22,920
very short period time.
There has literally been,

999
00:46:22,921 --> 00:46:24,960
in my lifetime,
a revolution in the martial arts.

1000
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:28,620
It really has.
I've been saying this for a while,

1001
00:46:28,621 --> 00:46:29,454
but I'll say it again.
The UFC has changed martial arts so 

1002
00:46:32,851 --> 00:46:37,851
radically that there's been more 
improvement since 1993 there's been more

1003
00:46:37,891 --> 00:46:38,724
evolution than there are.
There have been in the last 10,000 

1004
00:46:40,711 --> 00:46:42,450
years.
That's real.

1005
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,313
That's 100% true.
You go back and watch martial arts from 

1006
00:46:46,291 --> 00:46:50,490
1993 and watch the UFC today,
it's a completely different realm.

1007
00:46:50,491 --> 00:46:51,810
Right?
It's fascinating.

1008
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,470
The differences.
Oh,

1009
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:54,333
of course.
When you talk about Jujitsu being 

1010
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:59,040
applicable and all its applicable inside
Jujitsu,

1011
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:02,160
the problem is when you get someone 
who's a really good wrestler,

1012
00:47:02,161 --> 00:47:05,130
who's an awesome kickboxer and you can't
use your Jujitsu,

1013
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:06,720
you're still going to get fucked up.

1014
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:10,170
Like a guy like chuck Liddell who you're
not going to take down and he's going to

1015
00:47:10,171 --> 00:47:12,030
knock you dead.
He's a great wrestler.

1016
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:14,760
You mean he's a perfect anti Jujitsu 
guy?

1017
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,410
Okay.
But even even that,

1018
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,840
look at that,
I gave five things that work,

1019
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:20,610
boxing and wrestling with two of the 
five.

1020
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,580
They train against resisting opponents,
right?

1021
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:25,080
Uh,
so it's no surprise then,

1022
00:47:25,081 --> 00:47:27,300
and maybe sometimes he comes from a 
Kempo background,

1023
00:47:27,301 --> 00:47:28,200
you know,
I mean,

1024
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,073
you,
you've listed that it's one of the 

1025
00:47:30,131 --> 00:47:30,964
martial arts that don't really work,
but that's the martial art that 

1026
00:47:33,101 --> 00:47:35,410
chocolate Dell learned for striking 
under John Hackleman.

1027
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:35,981
Yeah.
Okay.

1028
00:47:35,981 --> 00:47:37,570
So I mean,
that's another example.

1029
00:47:37,571 --> 00:47:38,910
People can,
like I,

1030
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:39,761
I saw,
I can't,

1031
00:47:39,761 --> 00:47:42,850
so you're much more versed in the 
specifics than I am,

1032
00:47:42,851 --> 00:47:43,684
but I,
sorry,

1033
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:46,210
to burst a gunner Nelson fight and what 
she did,

1034
00:47:46,211 --> 00:47:47,044
uh,
I think it was,

1035
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:47,883
uh,
uh,

1036
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:51,890
background hoss to someone's head and 
just ground Dick.

1037
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:52,480
He did.
Uh,

1038
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,111
no,
he did.

1039
00:47:53,111 --> 00:47:53,944
Uh,
I thought he looked around house to 

1040
00:47:55,481 --> 00:47:56,314
someone's in the back of someone's head.
He trained in traditional karate for 

1041
00:48:00,281 --> 00:48:01,310
years,
Huh?

1042
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:01,991
Yes.
Yeah.

1043
00:48:01,991 --> 00:48:03,400
He's a brown belt in karate.
Yeah.

1044
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:04,293
And so it's not that these techniques 
can't be integrated or that they don't 

1045
00:48:07,631 --> 00:48:09,690
work.
Part of the problem is that they're sold

1046
00:48:09,691 --> 00:48:10,960
as systems.
You know,

1047
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:13,420
it's like,
instead of picking and choosing,

1048
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:15,940
so if everybody trained against 
resisting opponents,

1049
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,550
it's not clear to me that there would be
any styles,

1050
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:20,490
styles would fade away.
Right.

1051
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:21,343
But then,
and then that highlights the problem 

1052
00:48:22,121 --> 00:48:25,450
that we brought up earlier that you 
really can't resist.

1053
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:28,810
You can't train 100% resisting with 
kickboxing.

1054
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:31,690
If you want to be a healthy member of 
society,

1055
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:33,153
that's brain damage.
I'm pretty sure I have brain damage and 

1056
00:48:36,671 --> 00:48:39,490
I stopped really getting hit in the head
when I was 22.

1057
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:40,763
I mean,
I really haven't been hitting the head 

1058
00:48:41,261 --> 00:48:42,094
of that much since then,
but I'm for sure something's fucked up 

1059
00:48:44,141 --> 00:48:44,710
in there.
Yeah.

1060
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:48,940
I was watching a guy hit the pads about 
a brown belt a couple of weeks ago and I

1061
00:48:48,941 --> 00:48:50,260
just thought to myself,
I mean he,

1062
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:52,840
the whole thing was moving it and I 
thought to myself like,

1063
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,910
wow,
like if that guy ever hit me,

1064
00:48:55,090 --> 00:48:56,470
Oh yeah.
I mean that would be it.

1065
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:59,080
I mean,
it would just be over and,

1066
00:48:59,081 --> 00:48:59,914
and I,
and I watched people kick the heavy bag 

1067
00:49:00,801 --> 00:49:02,910
sometimes.
Have you ever seen Melvin manhoef kicked

1068
00:49:02,911 --> 00:49:03,744
the pads?
Jesus Christ pull up Melvin manhoef 

1069
00:49:06,371 --> 00:49:07,810
trains with,
uh,

1070
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,870
um,
I forgot his trainer's name.

1071
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:13,000
Mike Mike's gym.
And uh,

1072
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:15,860
I forgot how to say his last passenger,
passenger.

1073
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:17,970
I forget how to say it cause he's there.
Dot.

1074
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,900
They're a Dutch,
they're from Holland.

1075
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:21,550
But uh,
there's a,

1076
00:49:21,551 --> 00:49:25,480
a video is a bunch of videos of Malvin 
but Melvin kicking the pads with him.

1077
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:26,313
It's just Scott,
the I'm terrifying cause he's a super 

1078
00:49:29,831 --> 00:49:34,560
fucking athlete and he's training with 
this really aggressive Moitai trainer or

1079
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:35,403
kickboxing trainer.
Mike's gym is famous for like guys like 

1080
00:49:37,931 --> 00:49:40,040
Badr Hari and,
and um,

1081
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:45,310
man who have that are just fucking 
ferocious aggressive competitors.

1082
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:50,170
And manhood is particularly famous for 
having just unbelievable knockout power.

1083
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:52,720
He knocked out Mark Hunt and he weighed 
185 pounds.

1084
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:56,170
He knocked out Mark Hunt when mark 
[inaudible] was probably 300 pounds.

1085
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,033
Yeah.
And so imagine some of those guys or 

1086
00:49:59,471 --> 00:50:03,670
people in their lineage fighting it is 
what fighting these guys who do Katas.

1087
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:06,670
There's not pads though.
You gotta focus pads.

1088
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:08,560
See,
see if you can find one with him.

1089
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,073
Yeah.
That says,

1090
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:13,000
that's just my,
see if you could find,

1091
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:14,330
um,
Melvin manhood.

1092
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:15,610
That's him though.
That's Melvin.

1093
00:50:15,611 --> 00:50:19,600
But they're just sparring there,
which most of the time they,

1094
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:21,400
they go hard.
But,

1095
00:50:21,401 --> 00:50:22,234
uh,
they usually don't go too hard to the 

1096
00:50:23,351 --> 00:50:24,280
head.
Yeah.

1097
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:25,373
That's the Holon style.
So imagine those guys fighting these 

1098
00:50:27,981 --> 00:50:29,720
guys who are in make believe land.
Oh yeah.

1099
00:50:29,721 --> 00:50:31,550
You want your fantasy fantasy land,
right?

1100
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:32,413
We've,
we've played videos many times and 

1101
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:38,550
recently one or here's hills.
Malvin see,

1102
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:39,570
get some volume on that shit.

1103
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:52,240
Sounds not saying for some reason,
but you get the picture of him.

1104
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,230
He's a fucking destroyed that switch 
kick to the body.

1105
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:02,600
Good Lord.
When you watch this guy in real life,

1106
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:07,670
it's even more stunning because you,
you really can feel the impact when he's

1107
00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:08,930
kicking the pads.

1108
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:13,290
So the other thing about that is that 
guy knows we can do and he can't do,

1109
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,700
they don't spend a lot of these young 
kids,

1110
00:51:15,701 --> 00:51:16,534
they see a movie with a guy who's beaten
up five guys with knives and bats and 

1111
00:51:19,901 --> 00:51:20,734
stuff.
It's total make believe land and it 

1112
00:51:22,961 --> 00:51:25,000
immerses people in a culture of make 
belief.

1113
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:26,553
Yeah,
I agree.

1114
00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:27,910
No,
I couldn't agree more.

1115
00:51:27,911 --> 00:51:31,270
And I was in that culture.
I used to teach it.

1116
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:32,650
I taught at Boston University.
I mean,

1117
00:51:32,651 --> 00:51:33,520
it's like a big,
big,

1118
00:51:33,521 --> 00:51:35,500
huge part of my life.
And,

1119
00:51:35,501 --> 00:51:38,050
uh,
the wake up call that I got was,

1120
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:42,190
it was a really stunning thing to just 
to end.

1121
00:51:42,191 --> 00:51:43,024
It was,
oh,

1122
00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:47,770
it was a long progression.
It wasn't just one wake up call.

1123
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:50,530
It was like one wake up call and then 
another one,

1124
00:51:50,531 --> 00:51:52,960
and then deeper and deeper and deeper.
And then the UFC comes along,

1125
00:51:52,961 --> 00:51:54,160
you're like,
oh fuck,

1126
00:51:54,670 --> 00:51:55,421
you know,
oh,

1127
00:51:55,421 --> 00:51:56,300
this is this.

1128
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:58,180
And then you get this understanding 
like,

1129
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:01,680
I live my life under this illusion.
Yeah.

1130
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:05,500
And the other thing that's interesting 
to me about that is those are culturally

1131
00:52:05,501 --> 00:52:06,940
reinforced,
right?

1132
00:52:06,970 --> 00:52:08,890
There are these rituals.
There's the bowing,

1133
00:52:08,891 --> 00:52:09,724
the master,
the other people that your friends that 

1134
00:52:11,651 --> 00:52:15,790
you come to do these things with.
All of that reinforces the delusion.

1135
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:17,770
It's,
it's very similar to,

1136
00:52:17,890 --> 00:52:18,723
to,
uh,

1137
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:20,293
to religions.
The way that religions focus with the 

1138
00:52:21,941 --> 00:52:25,030
difference being that people in 
religions,

1139
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:26,043
people who have faith,
they think they're a bit better people 

1140
00:52:27,821 --> 00:52:28,654
as a consequence of them having faith.
Whereas very few people in the 

1141
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:32,463
delusional martial arts,
you think that they think they're good 

1142
00:52:34,271 --> 00:52:35,410
fighters.
But,

1143
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,540
oh,
the techniques are too dangerous to task

1144
00:52:37,541 --> 00:52:38,051
or we,
you know,

1145
00:52:38,051 --> 00:52:40,570
we can't,
we can't do this and see if we did this,

1146
00:52:40,571 --> 00:52:42,570
we would kill you.
Uh,

1147
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:43,533
but those cultures of delusion keep 
people trapped in thinking about things 

1148
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:50,020
that remove them from reality.

1149
00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:52,390
Yeah,
there's definitely some of that,

1150
00:52:52,391 --> 00:52:53,224
but I think there's some good to the 
idea of respecting a Dojo as a place 

1151
00:52:59,591 --> 00:53:01,260
where you,
when you walk into it.

1152
00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:04,060
One of the things stupid,
but it's true.

1153
00:53:04,330 --> 00:53:06,550
When I was a kid,
I used to have keys to uh,

1154
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:07,613
the,
the,

1155
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:09,310
the,
it was a doe Jang,

1156
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:11,320
cause it was taekwondo is the Korean 
word doubled.

1157
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:12,580
I,
even when no one was there,

1158
00:53:12,581 --> 00:53:13,414
I would bow when I would walk in,
when I would go to work out in the 

1159
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:18,161
middle of the night,
like I would go there,

1160
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:19,430
I had keys.
So I,

1161
00:53:19,431 --> 00:53:20,264
I would,
I would train sometimes I'd show up at 

1162
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:22,353
midnight,
I go there and lock the door and go in 

1163
00:53:24,021 --> 00:53:24,720
myself.
And then,

1164
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,280
but when stepped into the training area,

1165
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:29,610
I would always bow and I was like almost
like an ocd thing.

1166
00:53:29,611 --> 00:53:31,080
Like,
I wouldn't not do it because I,

1167
00:53:31,081 --> 00:53:31,914
in my mind when I,
like I had been trained and taught that 

1168
00:53:34,861 --> 00:53:35,694
when I entered that room I had to bow 
and even with there's fucking no one 

1169
00:53:38,730 --> 00:53:41,580
there man.
I'm by myself and I always bout like one

1170
00:53:41,581 --> 00:53:42,414
time my girlfriend,
my girlfriend was a freak in high 

1171
00:53:43,411 --> 00:53:45,270
school.
She wanted to fuck in the,

1172
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:46,890
in the gym and I was like,
we can't,

1173
00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:48,930
can't do it.
I'm like,

1174
00:53:48,931 --> 00:53:50,460
I won't do it.
We can't do it here.

1175
00:53:50,461 --> 00:53:51,510
And she's like,
come on.

1176
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:52,373
I'm like,
nope,

1177
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,740
not happening.
It was a lost opportunity for you?

1178
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,210
Not really.
I fucked the shit out of her.

1179
00:53:57,211 --> 00:54:00,120
I fucked her all the time.
We were like little fucking rabbits,

1180
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,410
but,
but it was,

1181
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:04,740
there was the one place where I wouldn't
do it.

1182
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:05,700
I was like,
we can't,

1183
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:07,260
I can't do it here.
Like this is,

1184
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:10,920
this is a sacred ground for me.
So I guess here's my problem with that,

1185
00:54:11,070 --> 00:54:14,280
besides the lost opportunity,
but it wasn't a lost opportunity for me.

1186
00:54:14,281 --> 00:54:17,250
It was an execution of discipline of my 
mind.

1187
00:54:17,251 --> 00:54:18,084
Like I,
it was very hard for a 17 year old boy 

1188
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:21,563
to not have sex with this hot,
I think she was 1616 year old girl who 

1189
00:54:26,251 --> 00:54:29,610
wanted a bang in this karate or 
taekwondo gym.

1190
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:32,630
That's like,
for me it was like that.

1191
00:54:32,631 --> 00:54:34,160
This,
this what,

1192
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:35,043
what martial arts meant to me at the 
time was there was this the first thing 

1193
00:54:38,791 --> 00:54:41,430
that I had ever done that made me feel 
like I wasn't a loser.

1194
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:42,833
So my whole life I'd been insecure and 
we had moved around a lot when I was a 

1195
00:54:46,351 --> 00:54:47,184
kid.
I didn't really have a whole lot of 

1196
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:50,160
friends and I never felt like I fit in 
and I always felt,

1197
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:52,250
you know,
I didn't know my dad and you know,

1198
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:53,940
my stepdad was a little distant.

1199
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:55,680
There was all this stuff going on,
right?

1200
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:58,830
There was all these things that just 
didn't feel right,

1201
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:00,990
didn't,
didn't make me feel good.

1202
00:55:01,350 --> 00:55:04,110
And then this one thing came along that 
made me feel good.

1203
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:06,970
It's one thing came along that I had 
gotten really proficient,

1204
00:55:06,971 --> 00:55:07,804
not really quickly and was absolutely 
obsessed with and I was doing it all 

1205
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:11,191
day,
all day.

1206
00:55:11,191 --> 00:55:14,070
And there was a,
that was my whole focus of my life.

1207
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:15,990
Other than the girl.
No,

1208
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:16,711
no,
it wasn't not sure.

1209
00:55:16,711 --> 00:55:19,380
I'm sure it wasn't good at that.
I'm sure it was probably terrible,

1210
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:23,340
but point being like I wasn't willing to
sacrifice that.

1211
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:25,440
Like the ideals.
It's interesting isn't it?

1212
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:26,300
Yeah.
Yeah.

1213
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:28,890
So we use the same today.
Do you think,

1214
00:55:28,891 --> 00:55:31,770
I mean do you have that notion of sacred
with regard to these things?

1215
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:35,430
I don't have that notion of sacred when 
it comes to like a space,

1216
00:55:35,550 --> 00:55:38,640
but I do in terms of like my approach to
things.

1217
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:41,700
Like what if I,
if I'm focused on something,

1218
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:44,220
like I don't allow myself to get 
distracted.

1219
00:55:44,221 --> 00:55:45,680
If something is is,
is,

1220
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:46,553
is critical,
something's like really important to 

1221
00:55:48,181 --> 00:55:49,014
focus on.
And I decided this is what I'm doing 

1222
00:55:50,131 --> 00:55:51,870
now,
now I'm doing this,

1223
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:54,900
you know?
So if I may wanna be overly personal,

1224
00:55:54,901 --> 00:55:58,620
but like your marriage,
you decided to do it,

1225
00:55:58,770 --> 00:56:01,110
you're focusing on it too.
So it's taken me,

1226
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:03,360
marriage is a contract.
Okay.

1227
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:04,710
Relationships?
Yes.

1228
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:08,940
Like the way you engage with someone.
Like if you care about someone,

1229
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:09,803
here's a good way.
Not just relationships as far as like 

1230
00:56:12,091 --> 00:56:13,680
sexual relationships,
but friendships.

1231
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:14,843
If you care about someone and you,
you really enjoy being with them and 

1232
00:56:17,911 --> 00:56:20,160
they're one of the most important people
in your life.

1233
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:21,413
Like when you interact with them,
I think you should interact with them 

1234
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:28,690
under that provision or with that 
thought in mind with that.

1235
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:29,553
Would that intention with what I missed?
You intention that you care about them 

1236
00:56:32,411 --> 00:56:33,244
very deeply.
These are important people in your life 

1237
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:37,180
authentically.
Like you don't,

1238
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:38,770
you don't ever want,
like I don't,

1239
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,770
I would never like,
like really good friends.

1240
00:56:41,771 --> 00:56:45,370
I would never yell at them and um,
you know,

1241
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:48,160
call them a piece of shit.
I never want you in my life.

1242
00:56:48,161 --> 00:56:48,994
Or it's like say crazy things to people 
that sometimes people say hurtful 

1243
00:56:52,021 --> 00:56:52,854
things.
Yeah.

1244
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:54,730
You know,
it doesn't mean don't be critical.

1245
00:56:54,810 --> 00:56:57,610
It doesn't mean don't correct someone if
you see them doing something that you've

1246
00:56:57,690 --> 00:56:59,410
seen your friends doing something 
stupid,

1247
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:03,310
but that,
I don't think that's a good example.

1248
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:04,300
I think,
um,

1249
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,400
because marriage is not something that 
like,

1250
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:10,120
it's like something you're trying to do.
You know,

1251
00:57:10,121 --> 00:57:12,460
marriage is like,
or even relationships,

1252
00:57:12,461 --> 00:57:16,660
friendships are just their,
those are their interactions.

1253
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:17,673
So they should ships or it's different.
Like it should be fun and enjoyable and 

1254
00:57:21,161 --> 00:57:23,380
all that good stuff,
but I'm talking about as a discipline.

1255
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:23,671
Yeah.
Well,

1256
00:57:23,671 --> 00:57:26,740
what I was trying to tease out from you 
is that when you were 17,

1257
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:29,470
you had this idea of the Dojo being a 
sacred place.

1258
00:57:29,471 --> 00:57:30,304
Yeah.
And you talked about what that meant to 

1259
00:57:32,951 --> 00:57:36,370
you and I'm curious if there's anything 
that you hold sacred now.

1260
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:41,020
Um,
that's a good question.

1261
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:45,000
Like that.
Not,

1262
00:57:45,010 --> 00:57:45,843
no,
I've definitely changed my ideas about 

1263
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:53,190
what that even was at the time.
I think what that was that need for that

1264
00:57:54,011 --> 00:57:54,844
sacred space in this like intense 
concentration and purity of that 

1265
00:57:59,921 --> 00:58:04,270
environment was really like my,
my ticket out,

1266
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:08,260
my ticket out of this life that was 
really unfulfilling to manhood.

1267
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:10,810
Yeah.
That definitely to sovereignty,

1268
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:12,580
personal sovereignty,
to,

1269
00:58:12,581 --> 00:58:14,470
um,
to realize that,

1270
00:58:14,471 --> 00:58:17,020
um,
it's not that I,

1271
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:19,120
it's not that I was a loser.

1272
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:23,020
He says that I wasn't a winner and I had
to figure out how to be one.

1273
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:26,020
It wasn't,
it wasn't all my failures,

1274
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,153
what I was is now and all those failures
and all those mistakes and bad feelings 

1275
00:58:31,811 --> 00:58:32,644
that I had,
those were really just lessons and that 

1276
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:36,483
now that I have this new focus and this 
new thing and it's shown massive 

1277
00:58:40,451 --> 00:58:43,240
positive results,
I will honor that.

1278
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:44,373
And that's what it was to me,
that the new focus being one martial 

1279
00:58:47,081 --> 00:58:48,070
arts,
fighting,

1280
00:58:48,071 --> 00:58:52,360
competing taekwondo.
So that space to Dojo,

1281
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:53,223
that Doe Jang represented a sacred place
for me because it represented this new 

1282
00:58:57,821 --> 00:59:01,180
ticket and I wasn't about to cash that 
in for some Pussy Holla.

1283
00:59:01,870 --> 00:59:04,360
You know what I'm saying?
Like was my thoughts Matt.

1284
00:59:04,361 --> 00:59:06,400
Now my,
um,

1285
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:07,293
I mean if there's anything I would think
that the world like life itself is that 

1286
00:59:13,361 --> 00:59:15,610
environment life itself,
is that,

1287
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:20,670
that Doh Jang life itself is that thing.
So you don't ever want,

1288
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:22,693
you don't want to steal,
you don't want to commit crimes against 

1289
00:59:25,881 --> 00:59:27,980
people.
You don't want to do things to hurt.

1290
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:29,240
All those,
those,

1291
00:59:29,241 --> 00:59:32,270
those,
those terrible things that we see out in

1292
00:59:32,271 --> 00:59:35,870
the world.
If the world was your Dough Jang,

1293
00:59:35,871 --> 00:59:38,360
if the world was your,
your church,

1294
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:39,473
if the world was your sacred place,
you would never want to commit bad acts 

1295
00:59:42,921 --> 00:59:44,210
in your sacred place.

1296
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:49,800
That's a lovely,
I wish we could figure out a way to,

1297
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:53,720
to help people adopt those values.
You know,

1298
00:59:53,730 --> 00:59:56,960
I wish we could come up with some way 
to,

1299
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,033
especially when we see what's going on 
in the Middle East and we see what's 

1300
00:59:59,511 --> 01:00:00,344
going on in the world and we see what 
the way we're treating our environment 

1301
01:00:01,851 --> 01:00:02,684
or climate,
I wish there was some way to make that 

1302
01:00:05,661 --> 01:00:06,494
real and palatable to people so that we 
would start being more authentic and 

1303
01:00:11,241 --> 01:00:12,320
more sincere with someone.
And,

1304
01:00:12,321 --> 01:00:17,060
and I think what you said about,
it's not about criticism,

1305
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:19,580
the way I look at it,
I think it's about forthright speech.

1306
01:00:19,970 --> 01:00:24,020
You can be forthright in your speech 
with somebody and not be,

1307
01:00:24,110 --> 01:00:27,140
be be an asshole,
not be a jerk.

1308
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:30,420
I think those kinds of relationships 
for,

1309
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:32,030
for me,
aristotle talks about that too.

1310
01:00:32,031 --> 01:00:32,864
But for me,
I think that the most meaningful 

1311
01:00:35,511 --> 01:00:40,511
relationships are those people with whom
I can be authentic.

1312
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:43,490
And be myself and be real.
And those are kind of,

1313
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:45,230
I don't like the word sacred though.
It's,

1314
01:00:45,231 --> 01:00:47,720
I guess that's the one kind of nitpick I
have.

1315
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:49,523
Cause you attach that to religion.
Well because I attach it to the 

1316
01:00:52,381 --> 01:00:56,820
inability to revise something.
I attach it to the utmost respect.

1317
01:00:57,270 --> 01:01:00,270
Yeah.
So if we replaced a sacred for respect,

1318
01:01:00,271 --> 01:01:01,104
I think we'd be noises.
It's one of the things I don't like 

1319
01:01:04,831 --> 01:01:09,120
about labels.
Like I like intent and intent.

1320
01:01:09,121 --> 01:01:11,550
Like my,
my idea of sacred is not like God.

1321
01:01:11,790 --> 01:01:14,400
Like it's not like a sum,
it's not a deity,

1322
01:01:14,401 --> 01:01:18,630
this unnamed unknown word that's been 
passed down from person to person.

1323
01:01:18,631 --> 01:01:21,090
It's based on personal experience based 
on a real thing.

1324
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:23,270
So when I say sacred,
like my law,

1325
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:25,830
my love for my children is sacred.
Right.

1326
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:27,630
You know,
like I say it in that window.

1327
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:28,390
I don't,
you know,

1328
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:32,070
say it like in terms of like harps and 
the clouds and all that kind of jazz.

1329
01:01:32,370 --> 01:01:34,140
And when we were talking about,
um,

1330
01:01:34,410 --> 01:01:36,450
like don't be an asshole to people you 
care about.

1331
01:01:36,450 --> 01:01:37,283
Like it doesn't mean it certainly 
doesn't mean I'm some sort of a perfect 

1332
01:01:40,771 --> 01:01:42,630
person.
Certain doesn't mean that I have been an

1333
01:01:42,631 --> 01:01:43,464
asshole.
And then sometimes when you're 

1334
01:01:44,281 --> 01:01:47,520
responding to someone else being 
retarded or someone being ridiculous,

1335
01:01:47,521 --> 01:01:51,540
you can be an asshole because you don't 
have the patience for it anymore because

1336
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:56,541
you don't have the a at the moment you 
don't have the temperament to charity.

1337
01:01:56,810 --> 01:01:57,600
Yeah.
What?

1338
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:58,890
Yeah,
it could be maturity.

1339
01:01:58,891 --> 01:02:02,520
It could be you're overwhelmed.
There's a lot of variables.

1340
01:02:02,550 --> 01:02:06,060
So like if someone hears this and says,
you know all,

1341
01:02:06,061 --> 01:02:08,670
well man,
I've been an asshole lately.

1342
01:02:08,671 --> 01:02:10,450
Maybe I'm a bad person.
Like No.

1343
01:02:10,470 --> 01:02:11,303
It's just recognizing those moments 
where he probably could have handled 

1344
01:02:14,641 --> 01:02:18,900
something better and continuing to 
approve and then also this idea,

1345
01:02:18,990 --> 01:02:20,310
here's this is a really important

1346
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:24,000
one because people have this idea that 
somehow I'm 30 years old,

1347
01:02:24,001 --> 01:02:26,490
I shouldn't be doing this anymore.
I'm 50 years old.

1348
01:02:26,491 --> 01:02:28,800
I should have learned by now.
That's all bullshit.

1349
01:02:28,801 --> 01:02:31,140
Throw that away,
tossed that shit aside.

1350
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:32,213
You like these ideas of numbers that 
people have in their head that by a 

1351
01:02:35,401 --> 01:02:36,234
certain age you should stop.
You are alive and if you are alive and 

1352
01:02:40,831 --> 01:02:44,070
if you are thinking all those numbers 
that you keep attaching,

1353
01:02:44,071 --> 01:02:44,904
will,
you know when Einstein was 30 heat or 

1354
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:47,890
shut the fuck up,
stop doing that.

1355
01:02:48,110 --> 01:02:51,690
That that is a waste of your time and 
stop saying to yourself,

1356
01:02:51,691 --> 01:02:52,524
I should be better by now.
I'm such a total non helping thought 

1357
01:02:58,170 --> 01:03:01,920
what you need to think of his life.
You're living,

1358
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:02,813
you're alive right now.
And if you've made a mistake and you're 

1359
01:03:04,861 --> 01:03:07,680
still continuing to learn and grow,
that's all just data.

1360
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:10,470
And I think bundled with that is 
gratitude.

1361
01:03:11,310 --> 01:03:13,920
Gratitude is giant.
We don't say a prayer in my household,

1362
01:03:13,921 --> 01:03:14,754
but we go around every night.
We have seven people living with us and 

1363
01:03:17,611 --> 01:03:21,210
we say what we're grateful for and what 
you went into commune when you doing?

1364
01:03:21,370 --> 01:03:22,230
Uh,
we have,

1365
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:23,340
it's a lot.
We have a,

1366
01:03:23,630 --> 01:03:25,320
it's a long story of a woman from China 
there.

1367
01:03:25,390 --> 01:03:27,570
It's a lot of Christ.
But what does she do?

1368
01:03:28,770 --> 01:03:29,603
Wink,
wink.

1369
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:33,033
No sex slaves and bocce though.
We have another woman who lives in the 

1370
01:03:35,881 --> 01:03:36,714
cargo container.
Everybody who lives in the garage over 

1371
01:03:38,281 --> 01:03:39,750
there,
no attention to the banging.

1372
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:40,880
Um,
no,

1373
01:03:40,890 --> 01:03:42,020
but you know,
we go around,

1374
01:03:42,030 --> 01:03:42,863
we talk about what they're grateful for.
Everyone is grateful and I think that 

1375
01:03:45,121 --> 01:03:46,460
there's something,
it's,

1376
01:03:46,830 --> 01:03:48,810
it's an opportunity to be authentic at 
that time.

1377
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:49,793
But it's also like,
I think verbalizing those things are 

1378
01:03:51,601 --> 01:03:53,400
important.
So it's not just the negative,

1379
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:55,950
I shouldn't be doing this,
but just the positive look.

1380
01:03:55,951 --> 01:03:57,840
Is it general as a general rule of 
thumb,

1381
01:03:57,841 --> 01:04:00,540
if you ever have any doubts about it,
just be kind to people.

1382
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:01,530
It also,
it's a,

1383
01:04:01,531 --> 01:04:04,050
it's great when you reinforce it with 
your friends,

1384
01:04:04,051 --> 01:04:06,340
like verbalizing it like a,
um,

1385
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:07,493
I'm a big fan of tell.
I tell my friends I love them all the 

1386
01:04:09,811 --> 01:04:11,420
time.
Like me and my friend,

1387
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:13,650
like my wife jokes around about it.

1388
01:04:13,930 --> 01:04:14,763
She goes,
I don't know any men that tell their 

1389
01:04:15,421 --> 01:04:17,010
friends.
They love him all the time.

1390
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:18,083
But all my friends do,
we all tell each other we love each 

1391
01:04:19,171 --> 01:04:20,100
other.
You know,

1392
01:04:20,101 --> 01:04:21,940
I love you brother.
And we hang up the phone.

1393
01:04:21,970 --> 01:04:24,420
I'm dealing with all my friends and you 
know,

1394
01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:27,060
there were always hugging and always 
saying,

1395
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:28,380
I appreciate you.
You know,

1396
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:29,243
I think it's really important.
I have a very tight knit group of 

1397
01:04:31,471 --> 01:04:34,980
friends that I care about very much,
and they're all very,

1398
01:04:35,010 --> 01:04:37,610
they're very motivated and they're 
healthy and the,

1399
01:04:37,611 --> 01:04:39,330
you know,
they're not without flaws,

1400
01:04:39,331 --> 01:04:40,164
but they're there.
They got shit going on and it empowers 

1401
01:04:42,811 --> 01:04:44,910
me yet new up.
So here's why.

1402
01:04:45,510 --> 01:04:50,190
Here's why that's important.
Because you got the tattoos,

1403
01:04:50,370 --> 01:04:52,800
you got to build,
you've been in the ring,

1404
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:55,680
you're friends with whomever,
whoever you're friends with.

1405
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:58,740
And I think that whether you like it or 
not,

1406
01:04:58,770 --> 01:04:59,603
you're in a position,
particularly with young people to look 

1407
01:05:01,501 --> 01:05:04,680
up to you.
And that is exactly the kind of behavior

1408
01:05:04,681 --> 01:05:05,514
that we want to see modeled.
It's not emotionally immature for a guy 

1409
01:05:08,251 --> 01:05:10,320
to cry at a tragic event.
It's,

1410
01:05:10,350 --> 01:05:12,350
I tell my friends I love them.
I tell you know,

1411
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:13,770
people,
I tell my buddy over there,

1412
01:05:13,771 --> 01:05:16,470
I'm incredibly grateful for the 
opportunity to stay his house,

1413
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:17,980
et cetera.
And I think that

1414
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:21,790
that kind of,
we live in a culture that's suppressed,

1415
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:22,653
these particularly males,
this the ability for men to communicate 

1416
01:05:26,141 --> 01:05:29,140
in an authentic way.
Also to experience emotion.

1417
01:05:29,230 --> 01:05:34,230
Like this idea of somehow or another 
being stoic has virtue to it,

1418
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:39,310
especially in the form,
in face of tragedy or even joy.

1419
01:05:39,510 --> 01:05:40,343
Like I sometimes cry more or for happy 
moments sometimes and I do for a sad 

1420
01:05:44,021 --> 01:05:45,760
moments,
but I,

1421
01:05:45,761 --> 01:05:48,460
I'll cry,
I'll cry fucking cartoons man.

1422
01:05:48,940 --> 01:05:52,150
I almost cried.
I have not a ton of times,

1423
01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:54,390
I'm not crying to cartoons.
But yeah.

1424
01:05:56,470 --> 01:05:57,303
It's interesting.
I think that that journey from you as a 

1425
01:05:59,501 --> 01:06:00,334
17 year old to now,
I mean there was some really core 

1426
01:06:03,611 --> 01:06:08,611
lessons for people out there struggling 
with maybe issues of sexuality or issues

1427
01:06:09,281 --> 01:06:12,410
of feeling they hate the world and then 
on good enough or their,

1428
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:14,260
they,
their self esteem issues are they,

1429
01:06:14,590 --> 01:06:16,020
and I think that they,
yeah,

1430
01:06:16,290 --> 01:06:18,640
it acceptance and that's what we all 
want.

1431
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,450
We all want to be loved and look.
So I'm,

1432
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:26,170
I'm 49 and it's like I'd much rather be 
people say about me,

1433
01:06:26,171 --> 01:06:26,860
hey,
you know,

1434
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:29,110
pizza really good guy.
Then pizza,

1435
01:06:29,111 --> 01:06:30,880
really smart guy.
I want,

1436
01:06:30,910 --> 01:06:32,200
I want to,
uh,

1437
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:34,780
you know,
I want to embody those virtues.

1438
01:06:35,250 --> 01:06:36,310
But,
but more than that,

1439
01:06:36,370 --> 01:06:40,240
I think that um,
the story that you told there,

1440
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:42,273
it's,
it's something that's accessible to 

1441
01:06:44,411 --> 01:06:46,990
people and it's a type of thing that we 
need to do.

1442
01:06:46,991 --> 01:06:47,824
We need to figure out how to move our 
culture towards these more humane ways 

1443
01:06:52,781 --> 01:06:55,900
of dealing with people.
And my own opinion is that we don't need

1444
01:06:56,050 --> 01:06:59,770
superstitions to do that.
You're a perfect example of that,

1445
01:06:59,771 --> 01:07:00,604
right?
We don't need people making objective 

1446
01:07:02,831 --> 01:07:03,664
claims about reincarnating and times 
through bodies like the dilemma or wait 

1447
01:07:06,281 --> 01:07:07,114
a minute,
you don't think the Dalai Lama is a 

1448
01:07:08,291 --> 01:07:10,780
reincarnated saying,
are you serious?

1449
01:07:12,970 --> 01:07:15,170
You got,
you got nervous there for a moment.

1450
01:07:15,210 --> 01:07:16,590
I thought,
wow,

1451
01:07:16,630 --> 01:07:17,463
this is going to be a long conversation.
You see my Buddha said another buddha 

1452
01:07:21,791 --> 01:07:23,200
right there.
See that's the funny thing.

1453
01:07:23,201 --> 01:07:24,034
If like I'll call it just call bullshit 
on that in class and everybody will 

1454
01:07:27,011 --> 01:07:28,090
freak out.
Whereas if I say,

1455
01:07:28,091 --> 01:07:30,080
Jesus walking on water and I do,
you can join.

1456
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:32,530
But if you start taking a moment,
Buddhists and people were like,

1457
01:07:32,531 --> 01:07:33,670
Whoa,
bullshit.

1458
01:07:33,860 --> 01:07:35,550
You know,
how could you say that?

1459
01:07:35,830 --> 01:07:38,290
Whatever.
The Dalai Lama is so cool.

1460
01:07:38,890 --> 01:07:40,510
He's friends with Steven Seagal.
Yeah.

1461
01:07:40,511 --> 01:07:43,810
Well you actually saw them years ago 
together doing their little thing.

1462
01:07:43,811 --> 01:07:45,630
That all gets connected.
Yeah.

1463
01:07:47,310 --> 01:07:48,260
No,
I um,

1464
01:07:48,550 --> 01:07:51,360
I had a psychedelic trip that or saw a 
bunch of Golden Buddhas.

1465
01:07:51,450 --> 01:07:54,510
So that's what lsd about no DMT.
Oh Wow.

1466
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:58,630
Cause that cause that like literally 
that guy like in that position,

1467
01:07:58,631 --> 01:08:01,420
but there was fractals with millions of 
them,

1468
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:03,910
infinite numbers of them.
It was very strange.

1469
01:08:04,620 --> 01:08:06,010
Um,
so that's what that,

1470
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:07,390
that little puts,
this guy made it for me.

1471
01:08:07,391 --> 01:08:11,710
I wish I remembered this homeboy's name.
I'll find it somewhere and I'll throw it

1472
01:08:11,711 --> 01:08:14,260
up on instagram.
I think it's on my instagram picture.

1473
01:08:14,261 --> 01:08:15,094
Right.
I don't know.

1474
01:08:15,350 --> 01:08:16,183
I'll find it.

1475
01:08:16,820 --> 01:08:17,720
But um,
yeah,

1476
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:20,870
all of those things,
all those things are not necessary.

1477
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:24,980
It's a,
I think we are necessary like all these,

1478
01:08:24,981 --> 01:08:25,381
uh,
the,

1479
01:08:25,381 --> 01:08:29,180
the false beliefs and all the things,
what they are is like scaffolding.

1480
01:08:29,660 --> 01:08:30,493
I feel like they're scaffolding for like
evolution and I think that that's 

1481
01:08:33,830 --> 01:08:38,370
ultimately the benefit that religion 
does provide is in,

1482
01:08:38,390 --> 01:08:39,223
in these insane beliefs in the sky,
gods and all these different things and 

1483
01:08:42,830 --> 01:08:45,290
we show reverence to these,
uh,

1484
01:08:45,291 --> 01:08:47,870
these deities and they have these rules 
that we must follow.

1485
01:08:47,871 --> 01:08:50,480
Otherwise we would be punished in those 
rules.

1486
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:53,150
There becomes order and then the order 
becomes society.

1487
01:08:53,151 --> 01:08:55,160
And that's,
that's something that people always like

1488
01:08:55,161 --> 01:08:55,994
to fall back on.
Like we are a Judeo Christian sound 

1489
01:08:57,980 --> 01:09:00,860
founded society and our Judeo Christian 
ethics.

1490
01:09:00,861 --> 01:09:01,694
Like I saw some woman who was arguing 
about Muslim terrorists and that was 

1491
01:09:04,431 --> 01:09:06,530
like one of the big things that this is 
this,

1492
01:09:06,531 --> 01:09:09,350
this country was founded on Judeo 
Christian ethics.

1493
01:09:09,780 --> 01:09:14,090
Sowhat monkeys were founded on eating 
bananas and we're not monkeys anymore.

1494
01:09:14,310 --> 01:09:15,143
No.
It's like it's such a stupid fucking 

1495
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:20,300
like just because something's founded on
something that's illogical,

1496
01:09:20,380 --> 01:09:21,213
it doesn't mean you should have 
reverence for that illogical things 

1497
01:09:23,991 --> 01:09:24,824
perfectly stated.
That's part of the problem I think with 

1498
01:09:27,050 --> 01:09:29,270
once we make ideas sacred.
Yes.

1499
01:09:29,310 --> 01:09:30,143
And they become much more difficult,
if not impossible to revise like George 

1500
01:09:34,190 --> 01:09:35,023
Bush saying,
which is actually I invite your viewers 

1501
01:09:37,370 --> 01:09:39,150
or listeners to listen to this.
Uh,

1502
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:42,200
he's prayed about the war in Iraq.
He knows who God wants them to do.

1503
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:44,780
So the moment you do that,
it becomes irreversible.

1504
01:09:44,781 --> 01:09:47,840
I used to have a bit about that where 
George Bush was like,

1505
01:09:47,841 --> 01:09:48,674
you know,
uh,

1506
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:51,470
that he's prayed about the world in a 
rack and you know,

1507
01:09:51,471 --> 01:09:52,304
God blessed the troops.
Imagine if he said instead of that we 

1508
01:09:55,161 --> 01:09:55,994
have found Satan,
he is in Afghanistan and we're moving 

1509
01:09:58,371 --> 01:09:59,390
tanks into that area.

1510
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:00,650
Everybody would be like,
Whoa,

1511
01:10:00,651 --> 01:10:01,970
what the fuck did you do?
Say?

1512
01:10:01,971 --> 01:10:02,870
Right.
That's the,

1513
01:10:03,030 --> 01:10:06,440
that's the draw.
That's the line that we draw.

1514
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:07,413
Like you're not hitting out.
He said he prayed to vishnu or 

1515
01:10:09,711 --> 01:10:10,411
something.
Nope.

1516
01:10:10,411 --> 01:10:12,230
I mean,
you're not allowed to say that.

1517
01:10:12,231 --> 01:10:13,064
You know the devil.
You're not allowed to say the devil is 

1518
01:10:15,231 --> 01:10:15,621
real.
Like,

1519
01:10:15,621 --> 01:10:18,440
and you never hear the president bring 
up the devil.

1520
01:10:18,770 --> 01:10:20,870
They'll bring up God.
God blessed the troops.

1521
01:10:20,871 --> 01:10:21,704
Got,
they'll never say Satan is at work and 

1522
01:10:24,081 --> 01:10:26,940
Satan is in the hearts and minds of 
these,

1523
01:10:26,941 --> 01:10:27,321
uh,
uh,

1524
01:10:27,321 --> 01:10:28,154
these enemies.
They never say that because it's so 

1525
01:10:30,051 --> 01:10:30,884
preposterous that we're slowly as 
evolution as thinking evolves and 

1526
01:10:36,831 --> 01:10:37,664
changes.
I know evolutions where I'm worried for 

1527
01:10:38,961 --> 01:10:41,720
there,
but as it improves and expands,

1528
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:45,260
we are no longer accepting the idea of 
Satan.

1529
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:47,960
Like culturally,
culturally,

1530
01:10:47,961 --> 01:10:51,530
Satan was an accepted thing hundreds of 
years ago.

1531
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:52,393
It was parallel like he,
like if you looked at the mentions of 

1532
01:10:54,921 --> 01:10:57,860
Satan and dimensions of God,
they were right up there together.

1533
01:10:57,861 --> 01:10:58,694
You're blaming Satan on the bad things 
and you praising God for the good 

1534
01:11:00,690 --> 01:11:02,600
things.
That's no longer the case.

1535
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:03,583
Now we just cling to these absurd 
notions of this one that's watching us 

1536
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:08,864
all the time.
And you've got to sort of peripherally 

1537
01:11:11,901 --> 01:11:15,630
mention it and casually reference it 
without going into detail.

1538
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:18,030
And you're allowed to do that because it
makes people think,

1539
01:11:18,031 --> 01:11:19,410
well,
you're on the same page as me.

1540
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:22,230
You're a god feeling Kurt and Christian 
man like myself,

1541
01:11:22,530 --> 01:11:24,690
I'm a god fearing Christian man myself 
as well.

1542
01:11:24,870 --> 01:11:26,490
God bless you.
God bless you as well.

1543
01:11:27,010 --> 01:11:27,980
You know,
but if you go out,

1544
01:11:27,981 --> 01:11:30,750
Satan is looking out for you.
Peyton's watching you right now,

1545
01:11:30,810 --> 01:11:32,820
Satan is just letting the air out of 
your tires.

1546
01:11:33,090 --> 01:11:34,170
Like you go,
oh,

1547
01:11:34,171 --> 01:11:35,910
that guy's a fucking idiot.
You know,

1548
01:11:35,911 --> 01:11:38,180
like we've moved past Satan.
Yeah.

1549
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,860
But we haven't moved past Scott.
Exactly right.

1550
01:11:41,140 --> 01:11:42,920
Or the idea of God,
even though,

1551
01:11:42,921 --> 01:11:43,754
I mean if there is some all knowing 
entity that is controlling everything 

1552
01:11:47,521 --> 01:11:51,750
and is filled with love and has a grand 
plan for the universe,

1553
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:52,793
they have yet to show themselves.
So this is all just a concept and an 

1554
01:11:55,621 --> 01:11:57,900
idea with no basis.
In fact.

1555
01:11:57,901 --> 01:11:58,734
And as we have found more facts about 
the nature of reality in the world 

1556
01:12:03,421 --> 01:12:06,330
itself,
it seems more and more preposterous with

1557
01:12:06,331 --> 01:12:07,164
every day,
every day the scientists come up with 

1558
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:10,193
these new equations that show the the 
way the universe could have possibly be 

1559
01:12:15,990 --> 01:12:16,823
been formed.
And the every day that these fucking 

1560
01:12:19,681 --> 01:12:21,960
guys at the cern laboratory,
the,

1561
01:12:21,961 --> 01:12:22,794
they're the large Hadron collider,
are discovering these what were at one 

1562
01:12:26,941 --> 01:12:27,774
time theoretical particles showing them 
to be true in their calculations to be 

1563
01:12:32,101 --> 01:12:32,860
correct.

1564
01:12:32,860 --> 01:12:33,693
We're having.
We have a deeper and deeper 

1565
01:12:34,951 --> 01:12:37,620
understanding of the universe,
but we think now,

1566
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:41,280
we love to think that right now that 
were filled with knowledge and we'd love

1567
01:12:41,281 --> 01:12:44,520
to look at ourselves now and look at the
past as well.

1568
01:12:44,521 --> 01:12:46,800
They didn't know back then,
but we know now,

1569
01:12:47,070 --> 01:12:49,770
but if we looked in the past,
they would have the same ideas.

1570
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:50,753
They would look back at those poor 
monkey people with the bananas and then 

1571
01:12:53,021 --> 01:12:55,200
they'll go those fucking dummies.
They didn't even know houses yet.

1572
01:12:55,530 --> 01:13:00,530
We will one day look back at 2015 like 
what a bunch of fools,

1573
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:03,690
what a bunch of ridiculous people that 
were still,

1574
01:13:03,930 --> 01:13:04,763
they have this incredibly complicated 
society in this wonderful access to 

1575
01:13:09,031 --> 01:13:13,260
information,
but yet they were still shackled down by

1576
01:13:13,261 --> 01:13:14,094
ideology and killing each other over 
religion and ancient superstitions that 

1577
01:13:18,730 --> 01:13:23,040
the dictated their behaviors.
Like what a weird time to be in.

1578
01:13:23,180 --> 01:13:24,013
They'll look at,
they'll look at us now in 2015 they'll 

1579
01:13:26,550 --> 01:13:27,383
say,
what a strange time this is adolescent 

1580
01:13:30,331 --> 01:13:31,270
period of,
of,

1581
01:13:31,271 --> 01:13:34,510
of enlightenment,
where they're just still there,

1582
01:13:34,511 --> 01:13:35,344
still concentrating on stupid shit in 
the fucking president of the United 

1583
01:13:39,270 --> 01:13:42,690
States can openly talk about God and 
every and no and no one goes,

1584
01:13:42,691 --> 01:13:44,250
what is God?
What are you saying?

1585
01:13:44,370 --> 01:13:45,203
Like what are you saying?
Do you think Jesus came back from the 

1586
01:13:46,651 --> 01:13:47,700
dead weight?
What do you think?

1587
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:48,713
Do you think someone walked on water?
Do you believe in the literal 

1588
01:13:50,071 --> 01:13:50,904
translation?
Are you an old testament guy or a new 

1589
01:13:52,501 --> 01:13:54,510
testament guy?
Well off a new instruments?

1590
01:13:54,511 --> 01:13:54,960
He's like,
no.

1591
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:55,793
Well the New Testament was made by 
Constantine who was a fucking Roman 

1592
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:02,190
emperor who wasn't even Christian.
He didn't even believe it.

1593
01:14:02,191 --> 01:14:03,000
He was,
he was,

1594
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:03,990
he was,
he was,

1595
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:06,660
he became a Christian.
I was fucking death bed.

1596
01:14:07,190 --> 01:14:09,260
Like that's when he became a Christian.
I go,

1597
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:11,950
these people that are really into the 
new testament and like,

1598
01:14:11,951 --> 01:14:12,100
I'll

1599
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:15,100
talk about old testament shit and people
get mad at me on twitter.

1600
01:14:15,190 --> 01:14:17,740
They'll send me this fucking hate texts.
You understand?

1601
01:14:17,741 --> 01:14:18,574
Motherfucker.
What the difference is the Old 

1602
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:20,800
Testament,
the new testament,

1603
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:22,610
because the new testament is utter horse
shit.

1604
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:25,660
It was created by a bishop and a fucking
emperor.

1605
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:26,673
That's a fact.
That's like established religious fact 

1606
01:14:30,190 --> 01:14:32,800
like everyone knows where it came from.
And not only that,

1607
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:35,320
it was written hundreds of years after 
the death of Jesus.

1608
01:14:35,530 --> 01:14:36,363
So what are you talking about?
Because if you're talking about the old 

1609
01:14:38,051 --> 01:14:39,490
stuff,
you got to go deep.

1610
01:14:39,710 --> 01:14:41,770
What would go to the Dead Sea Scrolls?
Go,

1611
01:14:41,771 --> 01:14:42,604
go to the,
go to the fucking did go to the most 

1612
01:14:44,891 --> 01:14:45,724
ridiculous aspects of that and tell me 
you basing your life on that because 

1613
01:14:49,331 --> 01:14:52,930
that's even more preposterous.
They found them in clay pots in Qumran,

1614
01:14:53,170 --> 01:14:54,003
written on animal skins.
These people thought the world was flat 

1615
01:14:56,081 --> 01:14:58,390
and a son was 17 miles away and we're 
going to have,

1616
01:14:59,380 --> 01:15:00,160
they did.

1617
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:01,600
They really did.
And we're going to,

1618
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:02,493
we're going to do,
this is what we're going to live our 

1619
01:15:03,311 --> 01:15:04,360
lives.
This is it.

1620
01:15:04,361 --> 01:15:07,780
This is all the facts we need.
Fucked the whole large Hadron collider.

1621
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:09,400
Fuck cern.
You know,

1622
01:15:09,401 --> 01:15:12,280
Fuck Steven Hopkins and fuck quantum 
physics.

1623
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:15,490
Fuck Neil degrasse Tyson.
Fuck those dudes with their telescopes.

1624
01:15:15,790 --> 01:15:18,800
Now that we're going to base it on 
leather skins and and and,

1625
01:15:18,801 --> 01:15:20,720
and charcoal ink,
right?

1626
01:15:21,070 --> 01:15:23,110
Like really that's,
that's the,

1627
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:23,973
that's the conversation we're having 
when we're talking about ideological 

1628
01:15:26,561 --> 01:15:28,720
religions.
That was a thing of beauty by the way.

1629
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:30,730
Oh thanks.
That was a thing of beauty,

1630
01:15:31,550 --> 01:15:35,290
what it is and people think,
well you renew fuse your nurse school,

1631
01:15:35,291 --> 01:15:36,550
your,
what do you believe in?

1632
01:15:36,551 --> 01:15:37,384
I had a guy yell at me at a comedy club 
once cause I did this bit about 

1633
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:42,730
scientology.
I do this bit about scientology,

1634
01:15:42,970 --> 01:15:43,803
about watching a scientology documentary
with my mom who made me go to Catholic 

1635
01:15:46,961 --> 01:15:49,340
school and how my mom thinks 
scientology's religion.

1636
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:50,350
Ridiculous.
I'm like,

1637
01:15:50,590 --> 01:15:53,530
what the fuck is this guy like,
Yo,

1638
01:15:53,531 --> 01:15:55,930
what do you believe in?
What do you believe in?

1639
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:57,570
Like what if I have to believe in 
something?

1640
01:15:57,571 --> 01:15:58,404
Right.
Do I have to believe I believe in 

1641
01:15:59,351 --> 01:16:00,184
everything that has been proven.
I believe that this is made out of wood 

1642
01:16:01,810 --> 01:16:04,080
and I see it when I'm proven wrong.
Right.

1643
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:06,730
When change your mind,
it's back to the Jujitsu thing again.

1644
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:07,833
But when you also think about it,
what an unbelievable arrogance to think 

1645
01:16:10,781 --> 01:16:13,120
that you know the will of the creator of
the universe.

1646
01:16:13,330 --> 01:16:14,163
You know what he wants you to do.
You know where he wants you to put your 

1647
01:16:15,731 --> 01:16:16,900
genitals.
I mean,

1648
01:16:17,110 --> 01:16:17,943
like you said it philosophy,
it's called the problem of induction or 

1649
01:16:20,171 --> 01:16:21,820
looking at the past,
the past,

1650
01:16:21,821 --> 01:16:23,140
past,
resembling the past.

1651
01:16:23,740 --> 01:16:24,573
And we will look back,
there's absolutely no question in my 

1652
01:16:27,281 --> 01:16:29,020
mind that you're correct and we will 
say,

1653
01:16:29,021 --> 01:16:30,250
wow,
will you believe this?

1654
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:31,083
This was,
how could we possibly have believed 

1655
01:16:32,111 --> 01:16:32,944
this?
But what's interesting to me is we know 

1656
01:16:34,661 --> 01:16:35,494
that that will happen.
Like we know that that will happen and 

1657
01:16:37,871 --> 01:16:40,120
it's an opportunity for us to reflect 
and say,

1658
01:16:40,121 --> 01:16:42,100
wow,
are we being arrogant right now?

1659
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:43,313
W are we thinking we know things?
So we pretending to know things when we 

1660
01:16:46,001 --> 01:16:47,440
don't know them.
And I think,

1661
01:16:47,860 --> 01:16:52,120
I think that a lot of that God talk is a
type of arrogance.

1662
01:16:52,150 --> 01:16:55,640
I think it's a type of people,
I dunno,

1663
01:16:55,690 --> 01:16:59,410
wanting to assert how moral they are so 
they reap advantages.

1664
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:02,060
The president or,
I mean,

1665
01:17:02,070 --> 01:17:06,040
I think it's a very complicated social 
and even political problem,

1666
01:17:06,220 --> 01:17:10,010
but it's also a type of arrogance.

1667
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:11,293
It is definitely a type of arrogance and
it's also a way that people stab the 

1668
01:17:13,821 --> 01:17:14,654
moral high ground.
They establish a dominant social 

1669
01:17:16,881 --> 01:17:19,880
position over you.
And the people love to do that.

1670
01:17:19,881 --> 01:17:21,830
They'd love to do that with their pious 
attitude.

1671
01:17:21,831 --> 01:17:22,664
What they're doing is by,
by them accepting these religious 

1672
01:17:25,131 --> 01:17:28,010
tenants,
they are somehow are superior to you.

1673
01:17:28,370 --> 01:17:29,930
And some people don't do that.
And you know,

1674
01:17:29,931 --> 01:17:33,610
I shared a hunting camp with this guy.
I don't need to names names.

1675
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:34,653
A wonderful guy who was a,
an elk hunter and this guy would get up 

1676
01:17:37,911 --> 01:17:39,950
in the morning every day before 
everybody.

1677
01:17:39,951 --> 01:17:41,600
And we've got up fucking early,
you know,

1678
01:17:41,601 --> 01:17:44,630
we would leave the camp by 6:00 AM so 
this guy was up,

1679
01:17:44,690 --> 01:17:48,530
I would get up to take a shower like 
5:00 AM and this dude was up reading the

1680
01:17:48,531 --> 01:17:49,364
Bible and he never talked about it and 
he never talked about like God or Jesus 

1681
01:17:54,771 --> 01:17:55,550
or any of the rules.

1682
01:17:55,550 --> 01:17:56,383
But to him it was a way that he explored
these ideas and how he related to the 

1683
01:18:02,121 --> 01:18:05,840
world and in application.
This guy was a fantastic,

1684
01:18:06,170 --> 01:18:08,000
absolutely.
He was a wonderful guy.

1685
01:18:08,001 --> 01:18:11,720
Like he was,
he was kind and it was like when you had

1686
01:18:11,721 --> 01:18:15,860
conversations with him,
he was generous and it was very friendly

1687
01:18:15,861 --> 01:18:20,861
and he was curious and he would ask like
these really introspective questions,

1688
01:18:21,051 --> 01:18:23,840
like he was a good guy.
And I think that's what matters.

1689
01:18:23,870 --> 01:18:28,870
I think it matters less whether or not 
someone is an atheist or not or a Hindu.

1690
01:18:29,060 --> 01:18:31,850
And I think what matters is how we treat
other people.

1691
01:18:31,910 --> 01:18:34,010
I think what manages,
if we're kind to people,

1692
01:18:34,011 --> 01:18:34,844
if we listen to people,
if we do our best to engage them 

1693
01:18:37,251 --> 01:18:41,270
honestly and authentically and often we 
get too caught up in,

1694
01:18:41,271 --> 01:18:42,290
well,
what is someone's real,

1695
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:45,050
especially now with the Republicans 
going bizarre,

1696
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:46,940
bizarre fuck with this whole Islam 
thing.

1697
01:18:47,290 --> 01:18:49,910
It's just crazy and disgraceful.
Well,

1698
01:18:49,911 --> 01:18:50,744
you know,
did you see that video is a fantastic 

1699
01:18:52,731 --> 01:18:56,750
video that's just been put out recently 
I think by some guys in Holland.

1700
01:18:56,890 --> 01:18:57,723
Um,
where they were because it's in another 

1701
01:18:59,541 --> 01:19:00,530
language.
Oh,

1702
01:19:00,590 --> 01:19:01,401
the Bible.
Yeah.

1703
01:19:01,401 --> 01:19:04,400
I saw that.
They put a cover of the,

1704
01:19:04,401 --> 01:19:05,234
put the Koran cover on the Bible and 
then read passages to people on the 

1705
01:19:09,051 --> 01:19:11,120
street and they asked him what do they 
think about this?

1706
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:12,560
And you know,
they were like,

1707
01:19:12,561 --> 01:19:13,394
wow,
this is ridiculous and this is 

1708
01:19:14,601 --> 01:19:16,580
outrageous.
And it was all from the Bible,

1709
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:18,273
like Hilarious,
hilarious shit that a lot of people 

1710
01:19:20,481 --> 01:19:25,370
don't know is in the Bible.
And when you even bring this up,

1711
01:19:25,430 --> 01:19:27,320
people already,
you're questioning their beliefs.

1712
01:19:27,321 --> 01:19:30,290
So they start foaming at the mouth and 
fuming and that,

1713
01:19:30,291 --> 01:19:31,124
fuck,
I can feel my phone get heavy from hate 

1714
01:19:33,081 --> 01:19:33,980
tweets right now.

1715
01:19:36,220 --> 01:19:37,053
It's just coming in.
You're fucking question in my view of 

1716
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:41,300
reality and it makes me uncomfortable 
when not going to work.

1717
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:44,840
Right.
But isn't that the exact same issue with

1718
01:19:44,841 --> 01:19:46,730
someone doing a fantasy based martial 
arts?

1719
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:50,120
Oh a hundred percent I've had 
conversations with people where they are

1720
01:19:50,121 --> 01:19:53,510
fucking furious at me because I don't 
believe in their death touch.

1721
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:55,700
I've had conversations with people they 
like,

1722
01:19:55,701 --> 01:19:56,534
you know,
you are arrogant and your belief and 

1723
01:19:58,281 --> 01:20:00,690
martial arts and you're in a position of
a,

1724
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:05,700
of influence because of your work for 
the UFC and what you're doing is you're,

1725
01:20:05,831 --> 01:20:08,160
you're fucking up.
Cause you're not telling the truth

1726
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:10,020
about certain stop.
Right?

1727
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:12,360
Like did you stop abandoned it,
but,

1728
01:20:12,630 --> 01:20:13,660
but you,
we,

1729
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:14,790
if you're like me,
who,

1730
01:20:14,791 --> 01:20:18,150
like I said,
I was martial arts and that the doe Jang

1731
01:20:18,151 --> 01:20:18,984
was so sacred to me,
I wouldn't need to have sex with my 

1732
01:20:20,041 --> 01:20:20,874
girlfriend there.
That represents like such an important 

1733
01:20:24,541 --> 01:20:25,374
part of their life.
It's just so lucky for me that it 

1734
01:20:27,901 --> 01:20:28,734
happened during my formative period 
where I was exposed to reality at a 

1735
01:20:31,561 --> 01:20:33,940
young age where I had to accept it.
I was like,

1736
01:20:33,941 --> 01:20:34,950
God,
Jesus,

1737
01:20:35,250 --> 01:20:36,083
you know,
I had to accept that these techniques 

1738
01:20:37,951 --> 01:20:40,470
don't really work all the time.
Some of them work,

1739
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:43,500
but you have to learn all the other 
stuff for them to work at all.

1740
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:45,450
Yeah.
And I wonder about,

1741
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:48,390
again,
so few people have written about this.

1742
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:51,930
I wonder about the experience that you 
had of that.

1743
01:20:52,740 --> 01:20:53,573
And I had of that we were in the same 
boat realizing over time that these 

1744
01:20:57,001 --> 01:20:59,430
things just didn't work and we had 
wasted our time.

1745
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:03,780
And I wonder how similar that is to 
someone's escaped from a faith,

1746
01:21:03,990 --> 01:21:04,823
you know,
like 100% people that have escaped from 

1747
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:08,910
cults.
Like I've had folks on that have a,

1748
01:21:09,150 --> 01:21:12,630
used to be in cults.
Kurt Metzger is a perfect example,

1749
01:21:12,631 --> 01:21:15,420
is a hilarious standup comedian friend 
of mine and you know,

1750
01:21:15,421 --> 01:21:18,840
he was in Jehovah's Witness.
Is that what it yeah,

1751
01:21:18,841 --> 01:21:20,400
I think so.
And um,

1752
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:22,170
he uh,
you know,

1753
01:21:22,171 --> 01:21:25,680
he won't accept any stupid shit now 
cause he's like,

1754
01:21:25,681 --> 01:21:26,311
and he's like,
no,

1755
01:21:26,311 --> 01:21:27,144
like when it comes to the regressive 
left and some of these ideologies where 

1756
01:21:30,811 --> 01:21:31,644
you have to look at something in a 
certain way and you can't look at it in 

1757
01:21:34,420 --> 01:21:36,570
another way,
it's like a dogma and he's like,

1758
01:21:36,571 --> 01:21:36,751
no,
no,

1759
01:21:36,751 --> 01:21:37,800
no.
I've seen this before.

1760
01:21:37,830 --> 01:21:39,820
I know what this is.
What you're doing is you're,

1761
01:21:39,821 --> 01:21:41,490
you're saying you have to think a 
certain way.

1762
01:21:41,670 --> 01:21:43,260
That's bullshit.
That's bullshit.

1763
01:21:43,261 --> 01:21:44,094
Like it can be discussed like you q can 
discuss certain aspects of people's 

1764
01:21:48,001 --> 01:21:52,650
behavior or gender identity or gender 
pronouns are in fact,

1765
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:55,590
not only can it be discussed,
but it has to be discussion.

1766
01:21:55,860 --> 01:21:56,693
We have to have arenas and a lot of 
people have been writing about this 

1767
01:22:00,541 --> 01:22:01,374
lately.
I wrote about in my book and I tweeted 

1768
01:22:02,761 --> 01:22:04,800
about it.
If we have,

1769
01:22:05,250 --> 01:22:09,420
if we're not allowed an opportunity to 
have a conversation than extremists will

1770
01:22:09,421 --> 01:22:11,660
step in with the answers.
Like trump is a great example.

1771
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:15,600
So we have to create spaces,
talk about spaces.

1772
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:18,210
This is probably another offshoot of the
conversation space.

1773
01:22:18,211 --> 01:22:19,230
The regressive left,
right?

1774
01:22:19,470 --> 01:22:22,950
We need to create opportunities for 
people to,

1775
01:22:22,951 --> 01:22:27,150
for sincere inquirers to engage things.
And right now we don't have that.

1776
01:22:27,510 --> 01:22:28,710
And again,
I,

1777
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:29,843
I can bring it back to Jujitsu.
I mean you could just think about what 

1778
01:22:31,531 --> 01:22:33,720
would happen if you know,
this is a technique,

1779
01:22:33,721 --> 01:22:34,411
you do this,
blah,

1780
01:22:34,411 --> 01:22:34,651
blah,
blah,

1781
01:22:34,651 --> 01:22:35,790
blah.
It's sacred.

1782
01:22:35,791 --> 01:22:38,730
We don't question it.
Then you'd never get to the truth.

1783
01:22:38,731 --> 01:22:39,564
You deny people the opportunities that 
they need to figure out things for 

1784
01:22:43,021 --> 01:22:45,030
themselves.
100%,

1785
01:22:45,390 --> 01:22:48,300
a hundred percent.
And I think martial arts is an excellent

1786
01:22:48,301 --> 01:22:52,080
vehicle for that.
The one of the things that was explained

1787
01:22:52,081 --> 01:22:54,510
to me when I was really young,
they're really did sink in.

1788
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:55,530
My,
uh,

1789
01:22:55,530 --> 01:22:57,060
instructor,
uh,

1790
01:22:58,170 --> 01:22:59,290
was a,
uh,

1791
01:22:59,370 --> 01:23:03,150
a disciple of general chase,
young [inaudible] who was the founder of

1792
01:23:03,151 --> 01:23:04,050
taekwondo.
He was,

1793
01:23:04,140 --> 01:23:06,150
you know,
he taught it to troops and he was like,

1794
01:23:06,150 --> 01:23:06,983
or the,
the guy's like really honed the 

1795
01:23:09,371 --> 01:23:14,371
techniques for maximum power and 
efficiency and leverage.

1796
01:23:14,411 --> 01:23:16,210
And He,
um,

1797
01:23:16,510 --> 01:23:17,343
they had this idea that martial arts was
a vehicle for developing human 

1798
01:23:20,291 --> 01:23:21,760
potential.
And,

1799
01:23:21,761 --> 01:23:24,220
uh,
I read that when I was like 15,

1800
01:23:24,580 --> 01:23:27,720
and I've always used that phrase because
I think that's a,

1801
01:23:27,721 --> 01:23:29,830
uh,
such a massive,

1802
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:32,410
yeah.
What do you mean by such a massive what,

1803
01:23:32,580 --> 01:23:33,101
uh,
well,

1804
01:23:33,101 --> 01:23:34,300
it's,
it's,

1805
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:40,080
it's so clear when you,
when you understand that we will,

1806
01:23:40,541 --> 01:23:44,890
you go through life.
Life is filled with questions,

1807
01:23:44,891 --> 01:23:47,080
a diversity puzzles,
different things.

1808
01:23:47,081 --> 01:23:49,570
You have to figure out the questions you
have to ask of yourself.

1809
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:53,470
Examining your own behavior,
objective reasoning.

1810
01:23:53,471 --> 01:23:54,304
There's all these different variables 
that come into play when it comes to 

1811
01:23:56,021 --> 01:23:59,050
life.
And I think those are highlighted in the

1812
01:23:59,051 --> 01:23:59,884
realm of martial arts because mark,
if you can land a kick and you knock 

1813
01:24:04,301 --> 01:24:05,134
someone out and then that that happened,
that worked and you were in the 

1814
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:09,243
ultimate,
like especially the ultimate fighting 

1815
01:24:10,721 --> 01:24:12,160
championship is a perfect example of 
that.

1816
01:24:12,310 --> 01:24:13,143
But there's,
there's no higher level of problem 

1817
01:24:16,901 --> 01:24:17,734
solving than problem solving with dire 
physical consequences because your 

1818
01:24:22,331 --> 01:24:25,120
emotions are on the line,
your fears,

1819
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:27,790
your anxiety.
There's so,

1820
01:24:27,820 --> 01:24:31,510
there's so many fight or flight 
mechanisms in place,

1821
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,640
there's self doubt,
there's,

1822
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:34,533
you know,
how much discipline did you truly 

1823
01:24:36,221 --> 01:24:39,520
execute in training?
Did you give everything you had?

1824
01:24:39,521 --> 01:24:43,540
Did you reach your full potential?
Most people go through life without even

1825
01:24:43,541 --> 01:24:47,050
coming close to their full potential.
And they live life in this,

1826
01:24:47,350 --> 01:24:52,350
this weird fog of uncertainty and of 
regret and of,

1827
01:24:53,891 --> 01:24:54,724
of,
of just this feeling that they're not 

1828
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:57,633
accomplishing what they want to,
that they're not achieving their full 

1829
01:25:00,581 --> 01:25:01,414
potential.
And that martial arts is a vehicle for 

1830
01:25:03,311 --> 01:25:04,144
developing potential because through the
very difficult training and through 

1831
01:25:08,771 --> 01:25:11,740
pushing yourself when you don't think 
you can,

1832
01:25:11,890 --> 01:25:16,210
and through this overwhelming desire for
comfort,

1833
01:25:16,270 --> 01:25:17,710
we don't want to get out of bed.

1834
01:25:17,810 --> 01:25:18,643
What are you,
you don't want to do the training where 

1835
01:25:19,691 --> 01:25:22,210
you would rather just blow it off and 
don't go to class.

1836
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:27,480
By forcing yourself to do that it,
it engages the muscles of discipline.

1837
01:25:28,330 --> 01:25:29,440
The inner muscles.
Yeah.

1838
01:25:29,441 --> 01:25:30,274
And it also you understand about 
accomplishing goals and about about 

1839
01:25:34,270 --> 01:25:37,840
reality facing things that it's just so 
important.

1840
01:25:37,841 --> 01:25:38,880
So again,
it's Jujitsu.

1841
01:25:39,490 --> 01:25:42,390
When you defeat somebody,
like if you,

1842
01:25:42,460 --> 01:25:44,290
you,
you work really hard and you tap someone

1843
01:25:44,300 --> 01:25:47,350
else,
you get a sense of,

1844
01:25:47,830 --> 01:25:49,810
you get a little,
I'll speak for myself.

1845
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:51,280
I feel good.
Like wow,

1846
01:25:51,281 --> 01:25:53,200
like I worked for this,
I tried hard,

1847
01:25:54,430 --> 01:25:57,430
I work on my baseball back,
choke now and I feel pretty good.

1848
01:25:57,970 --> 01:26:02,970
So that activity,
your hard work brought you to a point in

1849
01:26:03,471 --> 01:26:04,220
which

1850
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:09,110
you would tap somebody out.
And as a consequence of that,

1851
01:26:09,350 --> 01:26:10,183
you feel self esteem.
What we have done is we have inverted 

1852
01:26:13,881 --> 01:26:17,630
the system.
We tried to teach self esteem absent any

1853
01:26:17,631 --> 01:26:20,810
accomplishments.
That's not the way it works.

1854
01:26:20,990 --> 01:26:21,823
Self esteem is a byproduct of hard work 
of something that you have done as a 

1855
01:26:25,191 --> 01:26:27,950
direct result of an accomplishment.
So every,

1856
01:26:27,951 --> 01:26:28,784
every few years they give Americans,
they give kids all around the world to 

1857
01:26:31,161 --> 01:26:32,360
test.
I read this in um,

1858
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:35,450
Martin is the conspiracy of ignorance 
many years ago,

1859
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:38,000
excuse me.
In the to the test is like,

1860
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:39,650
Hey,
all these people in the world,

1861
01:26:39,710 --> 01:26:41,660
you know the Koreans,
the industrialized world,

1862
01:26:41,710 --> 01:26:42,860
Japanese,
German center,

1863
01:26:42,980 --> 01:26:43,813
they took this,
how do you think you did in relation to 

1864
01:26:45,771 --> 01:26:46,604
them?
Americans consistently score on the 

1865
01:26:47,931 --> 01:26:51,650
bottom core tile in terms of their math 
and science,

1866
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:56,150
how well they did and in comparatively,
but they score extraordinarily high.

1867
01:26:56,150 --> 01:26:58,580
Number one,
almost always in terms of self esteem.

1868
01:26:58,910 --> 01:27:02,090
We have taught the wrong things.
We focused on the wrong things.

1869
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:05,690
Our school systems have been oriented 
toward the wrong things.

1870
01:27:06,290 --> 01:27:07,123
And I think again,
you can just bring that back to Jujitsu 

1871
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:10,610
and look at it.
Look at that.

1872
01:27:10,690 --> 01:27:12,260
You don't,
you couldn't possibly,

1873
01:27:12,380 --> 01:27:14,840
you could teach someone all of a self.
So you walk in,

1874
01:27:14,841 --> 01:27:15,674
they get a white belt,
you teach him to feel good about 

1875
01:27:16,611 --> 01:27:17,720
themselves,
do this to this,

1876
01:27:17,721 --> 01:27:19,100
to this,
but does it work?

1877
01:27:20,140 --> 01:27:20,973
Yeah,
yeah.

1878
01:27:20,980 --> 01:27:21,880
No,
it's,

1879
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:23,353
you could get a lot of the lessons from 
martial arts out of a lot of difficult 

1880
01:27:27,231 --> 01:27:28,640
endeavors.
You know,

1881
01:27:28,641 --> 01:27:31,540
I just don't think you get the problem 
solving aspect at the,

1882
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:32,413
it's such a high level,
like some people find that in rock 

1883
01:27:35,631 --> 01:27:38,110
climbing because it's scary.
And then in,

1884
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:38,953
in,
in accomplishing that and then getting 

1885
01:27:39,981 --> 01:27:41,240
through that you,
you,

1886
01:27:41,330 --> 01:27:46,330
you learn about yourself and learn about
your ability to Chicago adversity and to

1887
01:27:46,821 --> 01:27:47,750
face your fears.

1888
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:49,153
But I just think that martial arts is a 
more intense version of it because 

1889
01:27:53,510 --> 01:27:56,900
there's all this connected to combat and
to this,

1890
01:27:56,901 --> 01:27:59,300
the physical challenge of overcoming 
another human being.

1891
01:27:59,301 --> 01:28:00,134
And it's one of our biggest fears.
One of our biggest fears other than 

1892
01:28:02,241 --> 01:28:06,080
falling off of a mountain is being 
dominated by another human being,

1893
01:28:06,081 --> 01:28:10,790
getting your ass kicked and conflict 
where we have this long history of war.

1894
01:28:10,970 --> 01:28:12,530
I mean,
I was talking to,

1895
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:14,670
I heard that podcast the Jocko.
Yeah.

1896
01:28:14,690 --> 01:28:16,330
The seal guy.
Yeah.

1897
01:28:16,420 --> 01:28:18,230
That's a great podcast.
He's an awesome guy.

1898
01:28:18,470 --> 01:28:19,303
But we were talking about the 
conversation that I had with my friend 

1899
01:28:21,831 --> 01:28:24,070
Duncan trussell where I said that and 
we,

1900
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:24,913
it was kind of a revelation for the both
of us and like human history is a 

1901
01:28:27,231 --> 01:28:31,010
history of the wars.
That's when we talk about human history.

1902
01:28:31,011 --> 01:28:33,950
It's like the stuff that happened in 
between the wars and you know,

1903
01:28:33,951 --> 01:28:36,470
some inventions,
but it's mostly the wars.

1904
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:38,840
That's most of the history,
you know,

1905
01:28:38,870 --> 01:28:43,510
where whether it's world war one or 
world war two or Vietnam or you know,

1906
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,353
there's all these different conflicts 
that that happened and those are the 

1907
01:28:47,481 --> 01:28:49,280
bulk of our history.
When we,

1908
01:28:49,310 --> 01:28:53,240
when we consider the errors in the past,
when we consider the,

1909
01:28:53,241 --> 01:28:54,074
the,
the ages of the different things that 

1910
01:28:54,981 --> 01:28:55,814
happened,
we consider like kingus Khan and 

1911
01:28:57,801 --> 01:29:00,710
Napoleon Alexander the Great and all 
these different things that happen.

1912
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:02,490
We're considering war.
Yeah.

1913
01:29:02,491 --> 01:29:03,324
I'll,
I'll go off on a little tangent if you 

1914
01:29:04,471 --> 01:29:06,480
don't mind.
It makes me think,

1915
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:08,033
I've been thinking about talking to my 
buddy over there about life and the 

1916
01:29:10,951 --> 01:29:13,050
universe in this thing called the Fermi 
paradox.

1917
01:29:13,051 --> 01:29:13,884
Where is everybody and I wonder if that 
the Fermi paradox being the amount of 

1918
01:29:18,120 --> 01:29:20,080
life that must be out there.
You know,

1919
01:29:20,220 --> 01:29:21,053
like why haven't we been contacted yet?
I consider that to be just an 

1920
01:29:23,851 --> 01:29:24,684
extraordinarily interesting question,
but I wonder if what you just said that 

1921
01:29:28,230 --> 01:29:30,150
our history has been a history of war.

1922
01:29:30,750 --> 01:29:31,583
I,
I,

1923
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:36,540
I wonder if inherent in every species 
that has evolved,

1924
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:39,730
they've had a similar history of war,
you know,

1925
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:40,583
because they've been subject to 
different evolutionary mechanisms and 

1926
01:29:42,991 --> 01:29:44,040
pressures and such,
you know,

1927
01:29:44,041 --> 01:29:46,080
like different atmospheres would have 
it,

1928
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:49,290
but I wonder if it's conflict over 
resources,

1929
01:29:49,291 --> 01:29:50,520
conflict over,
you know,

1930
01:29:50,940 --> 01:29:51,773
whatever.
Maybe they have another gender or 

1931
01:29:52,650 --> 01:29:55,860
something.
I wonder if that's just intrinsic in the

1932
01:29:55,861 --> 01:29:59,460
nature of life.
I think it is.

1933
01:29:59,550 --> 01:30:00,383
I think what's intrinsic in the nature 
of life is that sort of problem solving 

1934
01:30:03,780 --> 01:30:08,780
and that nature wants to find the best 
method of achieving a goal.

1935
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:13,200
And so the methods that are ineffective 
die off.

1936
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:14,273
And that's why 90% of the living species
that have been on this planet are 

1937
01:30:17,761 --> 01:30:18,594
extinct.
They no longer exist because they 

1938
01:30:20,461 --> 01:30:23,250
weren't effective enough to be,
to keep reproducing.

1939
01:30:23,580 --> 01:30:24,570
And you can say,
no,

1940
01:30:24,571 --> 01:30:26,760
we'll a lot of them because people wipe 
them out.

1941
01:30:26,940 --> 01:30:30,900
People are evil and people are horrible.
People are the dominant species.

1942
01:30:31,590 --> 01:30:32,423
What species do,
I mean many animals have wiped out 

1943
01:30:34,471 --> 01:30:35,221
animals.
You know,

1944
01:30:35,221 --> 01:30:37,740
there's a,
there's a real issue right now with wild

1945
01:30:37,741 --> 01:30:42,741
pigs and ground nesting birds because 
wild pigs being an invasive species,

1946
01:30:42,751 --> 01:30:43,584
they're dealing with these birds that 
nest on the ground that didn't have 

1947
01:30:46,261 --> 01:30:49,020
these animals hunting them.
And,

1948
01:30:49,021 --> 01:30:51,690
or they shouldn't even say hunting.
They're eating their eggs.

1949
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:52,833
Um,
so that's just an ineffective way to 

1950
01:30:56,020 --> 01:30:56,801
diet.
Yeah.

1951
01:30:56,801 --> 01:30:57,634
They,
it's an ineffective way to take care of 

1952
01:30:58,831 --> 01:30:59,664
your eggs.
Can't leave them on the ground and a 

1953
01:31:00,571 --> 01:31:01,404
place where these fucking pigs are 
rooting up everything and eating 

1954
01:31:03,691 --> 01:31:07,140
everything in front of them.
So if they go ahead.

1955
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:07,990
No,
it's okay.

1956
01:31:07,990 --> 01:31:09,000
No.
If they don't adapt,

1957
01:31:09,001 --> 01:31:09,930
then there'll be no more.
Yes,

1958
01:31:09,990 --> 01:31:10,860
absolutely.
Are Gone.

1959
01:31:10,861 --> 01:31:11,760
And you know,
people say,

1960
01:31:11,790 --> 01:31:12,780
Oh,
it's so evil.

1961
01:31:12,780 --> 01:31:13,613
It's so awful.
Would you want a world filled with only 

1962
01:31:16,890 --> 01:31:18,990
the spotted owl?
No.

1963
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:19,450
Okay.
Well,

1964
01:31:19,450 --> 01:31:21,600
the spotted owl dies off.
It's cause it sucked.

1965
01:31:21,890 --> 01:31:23,130
All right.
I'm sorry.

1966
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:24,860
I'm not saying we should kill the 
spotted owl,

1967
01:31:24,870 --> 01:31:27,090
but the motherfucker didn't make it.
Okay.

1968
01:31:27,091 --> 01:31:30,180
And the other animals are still here and
eagles are still here and got,

1969
01:31:30,181 --> 01:31:31,014
by the way,
you wouldn't want a world filled with 

1970
01:31:31,711 --> 01:31:34,410
all eagles either.
And there's a competition between eagles

1971
01:31:34,411 --> 01:31:36,210
in salmon.
If the eagles eat all the salmon,

1972
01:31:36,330 --> 01:31:38,090
we're going to be pissed at the eagles,
you know?

1973
01:31:38,110 --> 01:31:39,540
I mean,
if the eagles make the stamp,

1974
01:31:39,570 --> 01:31:40,920
the salmon extinct,
we're going to be like,

1975
01:31:40,921 --> 01:31:43,530
what the Fuck Eagles.
But you know,

1976
01:31:43,531 --> 01:31:46,350
it's funny when you're,
so you're talking about this and uh,

1977
01:31:46,351 --> 01:31:48,420
in the back of my head,
I mean,

1978
01:31:48,421 --> 01:31:50,910
you're absolutely right.
In the back of my head I'm thinking,

1979
01:31:50,911 --> 01:31:51,790
wow,
like the,

1980
01:31:52,430 --> 01:31:54,000
so we're having a conversation,
right?

1981
01:31:54,030 --> 01:31:56,430
You and I are talking like if I started 
as talk about that,

1982
01:31:56,431 --> 01:31:57,264
some of that stuff in class,
that's when you get the whole trigger 

1983
01:31:59,261 --> 01:32:00,700
warnings,
safe spaces and stuff.

1984
01:32:00,701 --> 01:32:01,990
Again,
like people would freak out.

1985
01:32:02,020 --> 01:32:04,120
But look,
this is really important.

1986
01:32:04,121 --> 01:32:05,770
I mean,
you're talking about species,

1987
01:32:05,771 --> 01:32:06,604
you're talking about survival.
You're talking about taking care of the 

1988
01:32:09,611 --> 01:32:10,444
planet and you know,
how do we weigh the concerns of the 

1989
01:32:12,671 --> 01:32:14,320
spotted owl against the loggers?
I mean,

1990
01:32:14,321 --> 01:32:18,250
you're talking about some really 
important things and the recourse to I'm

1991
01:32:18,251 --> 01:32:20,260
offended or I can't think of what makes 
me upset.

1992
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:25,240
It makes me think that maybe soon 
universities won't be the,

1993
01:32:25,390 --> 01:32:28,060
I mean we'll have to have these 
discussions out of the universities,

1994
01:32:28,090 --> 01:32:30,460
which really be,
it's a great for you in your show.

1995
01:32:30,461 --> 01:32:32,170
It's at,
but it's terrible for the society.

1996
01:32:32,171 --> 01:32:34,060
It's terrible for the university.
It's terrible.

1997
01:32:34,390 --> 01:32:38,770
The universities in a sense of cease to 
have these sorts of conversations.

1998
01:32:38,771 --> 01:32:43,771
When you watch those children scream at 
that professor at Yale and then you find

1999
01:32:44,051 --> 01:32:46,180
out that that guy was disciplined and 
like,

2000
01:32:46,181 --> 01:32:48,880
why were they fired?
Or they stepped down.

2001
01:32:48,881 --> 01:32:49,661
They resign.
Yeah,

2002
01:32:49,661 --> 01:32:51,520
I think they resigned.
Yeah,

2003
01:32:51,580 --> 01:32:53,800
we're fucked.
But I think,

2004
01:32:53,870 --> 01:32:57,470
I think liberals are eating themselves.
I think the left is literally arrested,

2005
01:32:57,480 --> 01:32:58,840
left breast.
I think there's a difference.

2006
01:32:58,860 --> 01:32:59,693
Yeah.
Well,

2007
01:32:59,770 --> 01:33:01,210
yeah,
that's a good point.

2008
01:33:01,211 --> 01:33:06,211
Because liberals in terms of social 
change and progress and you know,

2009
01:33:07,420 --> 01:33:09,610
acceptance of a various different 
people.

2010
01:33:09,611 --> 01:33:11,080
I think that's wonderful.
It's great.

2011
01:33:11,380 --> 01:33:12,213
But I think that this regressive left 
with this very rigid ideology of what 

2012
01:33:15,911 --> 01:33:17,350
you can and can't say.
And the,

2013
01:33:17,351 --> 01:33:21,910
the behaviors which they,
they engage in enforcing these things.

2014
01:33:22,330 --> 01:33:26,230
I think it's preposterous.
And I think that ultimately what's going

2015
01:33:26,231 --> 01:33:29,860
to happen is you're not going to have 
these kind of structures,

2016
01:33:29,861 --> 01:33:30,640
these,
these,

2017
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:34,060
these places where people go and you're 
going to be learning things online.

2018
01:33:34,590 --> 01:33:37,300
It's going to be a lot worse before it 
gets better.

2019
01:33:37,301 --> 01:33:41,170
And the hard thing is that many of your 
listeners are not in academia.

2020
01:33:41,650 --> 01:33:44,440
And when we tell these stories,
people,

2021
01:33:44,470 --> 01:33:46,270
they think that this kind of just making
this too,

2022
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:47,233
you are an academia.
So explain it from a first person 

2023
01:33:50,291 --> 01:33:51,580
perspective.
Um,

2024
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:53,920
so I give,
give you an example.

2025
01:33:54,220 --> 01:33:55,900
Okay.
So I had uh,

2026
01:33:56,410 --> 01:34:00,710
an individual and class and the 
individual is not even part of the class

2027
01:34:00,711 --> 01:34:01,544
and they'll write in the syllabus.
I put in this entire class as a trigger 

2028
01:34:04,061 --> 01:34:05,920
warning.
Like the whole thing a to z.

2029
01:34:05,950 --> 01:34:07,600
You had to write that.
I put it in.

2030
01:34:07,830 --> 01:34:08,663
They,
so if you're going to trigger warning 

2031
01:34:09,940 --> 01:34:11,830
right in the syllabus,
the whole thing,

2032
01:34:12,010 --> 01:34:12,843
I love the fact that you even use 
trigger warning trigger warning you so 

2033
01:34:14,711 --> 01:34:16,210
fucking stupid.
I did the whole thing.

2034
01:34:16,220 --> 01:34:16,570
We'll see.

2035
01:34:16,570 --> 01:34:17,403
Here's what happens.
Cause I was actually just brought up in 

2036
01:34:18,521 --> 01:34:23,521
charges again.
And if you don't do that then you know,

2037
01:34:24,041 --> 01:34:25,480
people can say,
well you didn't warn me.

2038
01:34:25,690 --> 01:34:27,970
Well actually I did.
I wondered the first day,

2039
01:34:27,971 --> 01:34:29,470
it's an Ita.
None of these in the syllabus.

2040
01:34:29,471 --> 01:34:32,800
I'll say this [inaudible] it's bold in 
caps in the syllabus,

2041
01:34:32,830 --> 01:34:33,663
in increased font.
So everybody knows your class is a 

2042
01:34:36,611 --> 01:34:37,444
trigger warning.
Yep,

2043
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:38,553
Yep.
The whole thing,

2044
01:34:39,370 --> 01:34:40,660
the whole thing.
And you know,

2045
01:34:40,661 --> 01:34:41,494
when I,
I went to the dean or whatever and he's 

2046
01:34:43,571 --> 01:34:45,160
questioning about things and I'm like,
and I said,

2047
01:34:45,161 --> 01:34:45,580
you know what?
Hey,

2048
01:34:45,580 --> 01:34:46,480
it's in the thing.
And he said,

2049
01:34:46,481 --> 01:34:48,520
well,
can you see how people could be offended

2050
01:34:48,521 --> 01:34:49,420
by this stuff?
And I'm like,

2051
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:51,940
of course people are gonna be offended 
by everything you mean fit her.

2052
01:34:51,941 --> 01:34:52,774
Bailey,
I talked with you talking about the 

2053
01:34:53,111 --> 01:34:55,690
woman who's offended because darth vader
was black,

2054
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:57,980
right on MSNBC.
The Dave Rubin

2055
01:34:57,980 --> 01:34:58,940
tweeted today,
right?

2056
01:34:58,941 --> 01:35:01,340
Which is one of the dumbest fucking 
things I've ever seen in my life.

2057
01:35:01,341 --> 01:35:04,580
She's saying that star wars is racist 
because darth vader's black.

2058
01:35:04,610 --> 01:35:05,990
Meanwhile,
darth vader is not black.

2059
01:35:05,991 --> 01:35:06,824
They took the mask off.
You'd dump con it's a white dial into 

2060
01:35:09,261 --> 01:35:10,820
there.
So I'm an idiot.

2061
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:14,040
I'm not going to say I can trump that,
but let me give you a couple examples.

2062
01:35:14,060 --> 01:35:15,350
Look,
skywalker's his son too.

2063
01:35:15,351 --> 01:35:17,270
And that's another white guy.
You fucking idiot.

2064
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:21,950
So here's one.
So this woman is in the class and I give

2065
01:35:21,951 --> 01:35:23,840
a class at the end of the end of the 
class,

2066
01:35:24,350 --> 01:35:27,470
she says,
I've never seen so many microaggressions

2067
01:35:27,830 --> 01:35:29,990
in,
I think it was nice to class,

2068
01:35:30,010 --> 01:35:30,920
uh,
knowledge,

2069
01:35:30,921 --> 01:35:34,070
values and rationality.
We use Sam Harris's book,

2070
01:35:34,071 --> 01:35:36,770
the moral landscape in that class.
And we talk about,

2071
01:35:37,310 --> 01:35:38,690
well,
we talk about heavy things.

2072
01:35:38,691 --> 01:35:40,190
You know,
we talked about Isis,

2073
01:35:40,191 --> 01:35:42,110
we talked about cultural relativism.

2074
01:35:42,110 --> 01:35:44,240
We talked about is there a way to make a
cross cultural,

2075
01:35:44,420 --> 01:35:46,580
I mean,
we're talking about things that frankly,

2076
01:35:46,581 --> 01:35:48,110
people in college should be talking 
about,

2077
01:35:48,111 --> 01:35:48,944
right?
Because they vote their citizens in a 

2078
01:35:50,331 --> 01:35:53,120
democracy and they need to engage these 
issues.

2079
01:35:53,330 --> 01:35:56,840
And College professors are petrified.
They're just in,

2080
01:35:56,940 --> 01:35:57,773
in a sense,
I understand that because it's a theft 

2081
01:35:59,601 --> 01:36:01,220
of one's time.
My case,

2082
01:36:01,221 --> 01:36:03,740
I don't care because I have no 
opportunity.

2083
01:36:03,950 --> 01:36:06,740
I was told point blank that you'll never
get promoted.

2084
01:36:06,741 --> 01:36:08,930
You could publish 10 books from Harvard 
and we won't promote you.

2085
01:36:09,050 --> 01:36:10,400
So once I found that out,
I said,

2086
01:36:10,401 --> 01:36:11,540
well,
I can talk about whatever I want,

2087
01:36:11,750 --> 01:36:13,160
so why did they tell you?
Well,

2088
01:36:13,220 --> 01:36:14,070
let me fit,
I'll finish.

2089
01:36:14,970 --> 01:36:15,950
So,
um,

2090
01:36:16,820 --> 01:36:19,600
so it was really interesting to me.
So she,

2091
01:36:19,601 --> 01:36:20,434
she gets up and she said,
I've never been so microaggressed the 

2092
01:36:22,641 --> 01:36:23,180
guys,
you know,

2093
01:36:23,180 --> 01:36:24,013
racist.

2094
01:36:24,290 --> 01:36:27,350
This is someone that again was not even 
the class,

2095
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:28,480
there was not even in the,
in,

2096
01:36:28,490 --> 01:36:31,550
in the class.
And you know,

2097
01:36:31,551 --> 01:36:32,241
I,
I thought,

2098
01:36:32,241 --> 01:36:33,920
wow.
Like what my first,

2099
01:36:33,921 --> 01:36:34,754
it was like,
is this person totally insane or did I 

2100
01:36:36,411 --> 01:36:39,590
say something that was really horrible?
What were the micro aggressions that she

2101
01:36:39,591 --> 01:36:40,520
was citing?
Oh,

2102
01:36:40,521 --> 01:36:43,460
well I focus in the racist part.
So I said,

2103
01:36:43,461 --> 01:36:44,111
well,
what did,

2104
01:36:44,111 --> 01:36:46,400
what did I say?
What did I say?

2105
01:36:46,401 --> 01:36:47,990
Because if I said something that was 
racist,

2106
01:36:47,991 --> 01:36:50,720
I really do want to know cause I don't 
want to be that kind of person.

2107
01:36:50,721 --> 01:36:52,310
So that's their belief revision thing 
again.

2108
01:36:52,311 --> 01:36:52,630
Right,
right.

2109
01:36:52,630 --> 01:36:57,110
Okay.
So she said you used the example of star

2110
01:36:57,111 --> 01:37:01,490
trek in a class and you were shocked 
when the woman,

2111
01:37:01,810 --> 01:37:02,990
when she,
she pointed the woman,

2112
01:37:02,991 --> 01:37:04,370
she didn't know she was right.
I was shocked.

2113
01:37:04,371 --> 01:37:05,204
I was genuinely,
I was almost flabbergasted that she 

2114
01:37:07,521 --> 01:37:09,860
never heard of star Trek.
Like I understand not watching it,

2115
01:37:10,100 --> 01:37:12,850
but she never heard of it.
And then I used the example,

2116
01:37:13,100 --> 01:37:15,860
the example of Marilyn Manson,
right?

2117
01:37:16,130 --> 01:37:20,660
She said that you assumed that she 
participated in white culture.

2118
01:37:23,180 --> 01:37:24,680
So that's racist.
Okay.

2119
01:37:24,710 --> 01:37:26,660
Now I,
so yeah,

2120
01:37:26,690 --> 01:37:29,030
so for Marilyn Manson is white culture.
Yeah.

2121
01:37:29,060 --> 01:37:30,230
Okay.
So this is a white guy.

2122
01:37:30,260 --> 01:37:33,370
So now we can really drill down in this 
and think about this.

2123
01:37:33,380 --> 01:37:35,720
Can to find a forum,
black fans of Marilyn Manson,

2124
01:37:35,721 --> 01:37:38,810
I'm sure it's out there.
Go to read it out for forum.

2125
01:37:38,990 --> 01:37:42,200
So now we can really unpack this 
insanity.

2126
01:37:42,310 --> 01:37:43,143
Okay.
So,

2127
01:37:43,550 --> 01:37:44,383
so she,
she tells people that everybody should 

2128
01:37:46,071 --> 01:37:47,570
file a complaint against me.
And I said,

2129
01:37:47,571 --> 01:37:48,440
okay,
well you know,

2130
01:37:48,441 --> 01:37:50,420
well let's,
if you,

2131
01:37:50,430 --> 01:37:51,263
you look,
anybody is free to free to file 

2132
01:37:52,590 --> 01:37:53,810
complaint.
Do you have the number?

2133
01:37:53,811 --> 01:37:54,644
I said,
would you like,

2134
01:37:54,740 --> 01:37:57,030
we'll put it around on the board and you
want to have a conversation with me?

2135
01:37:57,031 --> 01:37:57,451
She said,
no,

2136
01:37:57,451 --> 01:37:58,284
you're too far gone.
You're too far gone because you like 

2137
01:38:00,091 --> 01:38:02,690
start or you mentioned star trek far.
Well,

2138
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:03,090
I don't know.

2139
01:38:03,090 --> 01:38:05,970
See that's the thing.
It's like the horse analysis and run one

2140
01:38:05,971 --> 01:38:07,670
lane.
It runs off furiously in all directions.

2141
01:38:07,671 --> 01:38:09,780
And the whole thing is main thing that 
people do though,

2142
01:38:09,781 --> 01:38:11,640
they say,
I can't discuss it with you.

2143
01:38:11,641 --> 01:38:13,740
You're too far gone.
That's a symptom.

2144
01:38:13,980 --> 01:38:16,140
That's a symptom of space.
Safe spaces,

2145
01:38:16,141 --> 01:38:20,130
trigger warnings and microaggressions in
your mind that goes in,

2146
01:38:20,610 --> 01:38:21,443
I cannot speak to you will not get 
infected by your horrible ideas which 

2147
01:38:26,791 --> 01:38:30,420
come from Satan.
You are too far gone or repent.

2148
01:38:30,810 --> 01:38:31,770
Repent.
Peter.

2149
01:38:31,950 --> 01:38:33,180
So,
so here's,

2150
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:34,600
I mean,
this is what she's saying.

2151
01:38:35,020 --> 01:38:36,840
It is very,
it's very similar.

2152
01:38:37,080 --> 01:38:39,720
It's very similar on the left.
So what you're saying.

2153
01:38:40,050 --> 01:38:42,900
So here's what's happening.
So she black by the way,

2154
01:38:42,901 --> 01:38:44,490
cause it'd be awesome if she was white.
No,

2155
01:38:44,491 --> 01:38:47,670
she was his,
she was Hispanic.

2156
01:38:47,700 --> 01:38:51,060
Dammit.
So one of the things that that she was,

2157
01:38:51,090 --> 01:38:52,050
or maybe not,
I didn't know,

2158
01:38:52,051 --> 01:38:53,470
she said her name was [inaudible].

2159
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:54,840
She rolled her eyes.
I don't remember what,

2160
01:38:55,800 --> 01:39:00,450
how dare you racist the in the first 
name is Inigo Montoya.

2161
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:01,313
The first thing I said to her is my 
literally when she told me her name and 

2162
01:39:03,421 --> 01:39:05,700
said,
I'm sorry if I can't pronounce it,

2163
01:39:05,701 --> 01:39:08,640
but he caught a mundo bond.
Okay.

2164
01:39:08,641 --> 01:39:10,860
So here's what's interesting about that.
Okay.

2165
01:39:11,370 --> 01:39:16,370
So obviously she's been inculcated,
she is incapable and I never want to pay

2166
01:39:18,091 --> 01:39:20,130
pick on her because in a sense she's 
just a victim,

2167
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:20,993
right?
She's a victim of this malicious 

2168
01:39:22,201 --> 01:39:24,330
ideology that's running across campuses 
now.

2169
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:26,333
But people like that are not capable of 
engaging and entertaining ideas because 

2170
01:39:31,441 --> 01:39:34,980
they have this,
the university protects them.

2171
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,270
They can say they've been aggressed.
They can,

2172
01:39:38,340 --> 01:39:41,250
they can say they've been kind of 
violated,

2173
01:39:41,251 --> 01:39:42,084
if you will,
like cognitively intellectually 

2174
01:39:43,501 --> 01:39:44,334
violated.
But what's really interesting about 

2175
01:39:46,291 --> 01:39:47,730
that?
Two things.

2176
01:39:47,731 --> 01:39:48,564
One,
she thinks that she can arbitrate 

2177
01:39:50,071 --> 01:39:51,330
everybody else's reality.

2178
01:39:51,590 --> 01:39:52,423
So she thinks I can understand if I say 
something and he's offended by it or I 

2179
01:39:55,231 --> 01:39:55,711
say,
you know,

2180
01:39:55,711 --> 01:39:56,544
taekwondo and so like,
but she thinks that the regressive 

2181
01:39:59,471 --> 01:40:00,304
thinks that they arbitrate people's 
reality and they know what other people 

2182
01:40:02,941 --> 01:40:05,160
should be offended by,
which is amazing.

2183
01:40:05,310 --> 01:40:08,880
But here's the really interesting part.
I Love Star Trek.

2184
01:40:09,270 --> 01:40:10,950
I'll show you my,
my daughter in a sec.

2185
01:40:10,970 --> 01:40:12,930
Offscreen,
I love Star Trek.

2186
01:40:12,931 --> 01:40:14,460
I'm the j clean.
No,

2187
01:40:14,850 --> 01:40:19,850
but she's Asian and know star Trek.
It has everything to do with paws.

2188
01:40:20,850 --> 01:40:22,230
It has,
it has everything.

2189
01:40:22,231 --> 01:40:23,940
That pause was the emphasis.
It has emphasis.

2190
01:40:24,420 --> 01:40:26,130
It has everything good because the 
woman,

2191
01:40:26,550 --> 01:40:29,940
the woman I was shocked,
hadn't heard of star Trek was Asian.

2192
01:40:30,460 --> 01:40:31,890
You said she was?
No.

2193
01:40:31,891 --> 01:40:32,724
Who had heard of Star Trek?
It's a different woman now that there 

2194
01:40:35,041 --> 01:40:35,874
were two women.
One was the woman who said she's never 

2195
01:40:37,201 --> 01:40:40,170
been so offended in her whole life.
And the other one,

2196
01:40:40,171 --> 01:40:41,190
when she's,
when I missed,

2197
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:42,233
she said she didn't hurt her,
hadn't heard of it because it was white 

2198
01:40:44,041 --> 01:40:45,540
culture.
So,

2199
01:40:45,541 --> 01:40:46,291
okay.
Two different people.

2200
01:40:46,291 --> 01:40:47,071
So I haven't,
yeah,

2201
01:40:47,071 --> 01:40:49,920
I haven't articulated.
There's a woman in the class.

2202
01:40:49,980 --> 01:40:52,440
I use a structure for example.
She hasn't heard of it.

2203
01:40:52,500 --> 01:40:53,620
I'm stunned.
I'm like,

2204
01:40:53,621 --> 01:40:54,190
I can't believe

2205
01:40:54,190 --> 01:40:55,900
it.
And I use a Marilyn Manson example.

2206
01:40:55,960 --> 01:40:57,820
She hasn't heard of it.
I'm shocked.

2207
01:40:58,120 --> 01:40:59,740
Then the other woman,
the regressive,

2208
01:40:59,870 --> 01:41:01,190
the road,
the one who's watching.

2209
01:41:01,200 --> 01:41:02,033
Yeah,
the one who's watching the regressive 

2210
01:41:02,801 --> 01:41:03,634
leftist says you're a racist.
You know something that better if I 

2211
01:41:06,881 --> 01:41:08,030
don't remember exact words.
Okay.

2212
01:41:08,050 --> 01:41:09,880
Now I understand.
I was so confused.

2213
01:41:09,881 --> 01:41:11,120
I thought you were talking about the,
the,

2214
01:41:11,230 --> 01:41:12,063
all of these interactions.
I thought the woman who is the 

2215
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:15,550
regressive also hadn't heard about star 
trek.

2216
01:41:15,630 --> 01:41:17,530
And that's,
that's a problem with mark circulation.

2217
01:41:17,531 --> 01:41:19,300
Not your understanding.
Just apologize.

2218
01:41:19,750 --> 01:41:21,460
So,
uh,

2219
01:41:22,270 --> 01:41:24,880
okay.
So w w what was really interesting to me

2220
01:41:24,881 --> 01:41:28,930
about that is that she identified that 
person on the basis of her race,

2221
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:30,333
not me.
She was assuming she made w when you're 

2222
01:41:34,811 --> 01:41:36,760
a hammer,
everything looks like a nail.

2223
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:40,600
When you're a regressive leftist,
every single thing you think of as race,

2224
01:41:40,601 --> 01:41:41,770
gender,
oppression,

2225
01:41:42,310 --> 01:41:44,200
intersectionality,
which is parenthetically,

2226
01:41:44,230 --> 01:41:46,270
I have never heard their sectionality.

2227
01:41:46,330 --> 01:41:47,163
Anytime you,
you,

2228
01:41:47,190 --> 01:41:49,390
you see sectionality,
what does that,

2229
01:41:49,450 --> 01:41:50,283
anytime you hear someone use that word,
you can automatically assume they were 

2230
01:41:53,041 --> 01:41:53,874
aggressive leftist and the next thing 
out of your mouth they're most will be 

2231
01:41:55,841 --> 01:41:56,674
some kind of smear campaign.
There's a hilarious video of Steven 

2232
01:41:59,111 --> 01:42:03,120
crowder going up to people and asking 
them what their preferred pronouns are.

2233
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:05,650
I almost retweeted that,
but I thought,

2234
01:42:05,651 --> 01:42:07,540
you know what?
I got to get in trouble for right now.

2235
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:10,720
I know that,
but that's what it is.

2236
01:42:11,030 --> 01:42:16,030
They have really infested the highest 
levels of academia and it's funny,

2237
01:42:16,151 --> 01:42:16,984
these diversity offices,
they report directly to the president 

2238
01:42:19,571 --> 01:42:22,000
like they,
they are offices in search of tasks,

2239
01:42:22,570 --> 01:42:23,403
but back to this example,
so she was the one who identified the 

2240
01:42:26,411 --> 01:42:27,244
person on the basis of their race.
She identified me on the basis of their 

2241
01:42:29,771 --> 01:42:34,480
race of your race because somehow 
somehow there's,

2242
01:42:34,570 --> 01:42:36,430
there's a thing called white culture.

2243
01:42:36,610 --> 01:42:40,420
She knows what it is.
She's offended on someone else's behalf.

2244
01:42:40,930 --> 01:42:45,930
I'm a white CIS gendered heterosexual,
cisgendered use that term.

2245
01:42:47,060 --> 01:42:48,700
Uh,
okay.

2246
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:50,740
Are you being forced to use that term?
Is that real?

2247
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:52,930
Okay?
It's a question of being,

2248
01:42:53,380 --> 01:42:54,380
how's that work?
It's like,

2249
01:42:54,480 --> 01:42:56,680
is that a question of being forced to 
use it?

2250
01:42:56,681 --> 01:42:58,330
But,
but,

2251
01:42:58,550 --> 01:42:59,383
but that's not a real term.
Like that's not in any dictionary or 

2252
01:43:01,900 --> 01:43:05,680
bullshit nonsense.
But CIS gender is hilarious.

2253
01:43:05,710 --> 01:43:06,543
And the idea being that you shouldn't 
have to say transgender because 

2254
01:43:08,711 --> 01:43:13,570
transgender should be normal.
It's normal to want to be transgender.

2255
01:43:13,750 --> 01:43:14,583
It's like it's,
it's so normal that by saying 

2256
01:43:16,691 --> 01:43:18,430
transgender,
you're making it abnormal.

2257
01:43:18,550 --> 01:43:22,540
So I should say sis gender for people 
who aren't transgender.

2258
01:43:22,541 --> 01:43:26,680
Meaning if you are a male and you 
identify as being a male,

2259
01:43:26,681 --> 01:43:30,220
you are a cis gendered metric.
You're fucking mail.

2260
01:43:30,310 --> 01:43:31,360
Like we're,
we're adding all,

2261
01:43:31,630 --> 01:43:32,463
here's the thing about look,
adding all this extra shit to define 

2262
01:43:36,701 --> 01:43:39,340
things that are already defined by the 
original word.

2263
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:42,940
We don't need that.
You're doing it to prop up transgender.

2264
01:43:42,970 --> 01:43:45,640
Like that's the idea to make it so it's 
even,

2265
01:43:45,641 --> 01:43:49,370
we'll put sis regular gender trans with,
right.

2266
01:43:49,570 --> 01:43:50,680
So now,
so,

2267
01:43:50,740 --> 01:43:52,310
okay,
if that was another

2268
01:43:52,310 --> 01:43:54,950
great explanation.
So now why do these people do this?

2269
01:43:54,980 --> 01:43:55,813
Well that's a long story,
but one value that's responsible for 

2270
01:43:58,941 --> 01:44:02,120
that is radical egalitarianism.
Everything has to be radical.

2271
01:44:02,150 --> 01:44:04,000
Everybody has to be equal.
Yes.

2272
01:44:04,190 --> 01:44:05,750
Interesting though.
How,

2273
01:44:06,170 --> 01:44:07,003
you know,
and then they have these diversity 

2274
01:44:07,491 --> 01:44:10,700
initiatives and diversity requirements.
We need more faculty of Color.

2275
01:44:10,701 --> 01:44:11,534
And I actually think that that's,
that can be a good thing in some 

2276
01:44:13,701 --> 01:44:15,160
circumstances.
Uh,

2277
01:44:15,320 --> 01:44:16,153
so,
but what they mean is they mean 

2278
01:44:17,961 --> 01:44:18,794
diversity and the most narrow,
bigoted kind of a way they mean it in 

2279
01:44:21,531 --> 01:44:22,364
terms of skin color.
They don't mean it in terms of 

2280
01:44:23,421 --> 01:44:24,890
ideological differences.
They're not enough.

2281
01:44:24,891 --> 01:44:26,410
They're hiring,
you know,

2282
01:44:26,810 --> 01:44:27,643
uh,
Republicans and Libertarians or 

2283
01:44:29,631 --> 01:44:30,464
conservatives.
But the other thing that's interesting 

2284
01:44:32,841 --> 01:44:34,490
is that,
you know,

2285
01:44:34,491 --> 01:44:35,324
I think it was,
it was a on Sam's podcast with Douglas 

2286
01:44:37,160 --> 01:44:37,431
Murray.
He said,

2287
01:44:37,431 --> 01:44:39,380
we're going to be talking about pronouns
to the big thing.

2288
01:44:39,380 --> 01:44:40,940
Now we're going to be talking about 
pronouns.

2289
01:44:40,941 --> 01:44:43,370
While these people are still sneaking 
nukes in our cities.

2290
01:44:43,690 --> 01:44:47,300
It is a failure to Morley triage.
It is a,

2291
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:50,570
it is a system wide failure.
That's,

2292
01:44:51,020 --> 01:44:51,853
that's trickled down to individuals 
within the system to make it almost 

2293
01:44:55,341 --> 01:44:58,760
impossible for them to make discerning 
judgments about things.

2294
01:44:59,060 --> 01:44:59,893
And so we have this consequence now have
an entire generation of students who's 

2295
01:45:03,651 --> 01:45:07,730
being trained not only to suspend moral 
judgments,

2296
01:45:08,030 --> 01:45:10,670
but to think they're better people of as
being a result.

2297
01:45:11,540 --> 01:45:14,570
And it's also beautiful.
This is all coming from academia because

2298
01:45:14,571 --> 01:45:17,360
if you think about what a university as 
an academia,

2299
01:45:17,390 --> 01:45:19,940
like a lot of people that are in 
academia,

2300
01:45:19,941 --> 01:45:22,490
I went to college,
went on to Grad school,

2301
01:45:22,520 --> 01:45:24,740
got their masters or their phd,
started teaching,

2302
01:45:24,741 --> 01:45:25,574
never entered the real world,
stayed in a sheltered environment and 

2303
01:45:27,741 --> 01:45:31,790
now they're dictating this sort of 
behavior and thinking it's like,

2304
01:45:31,880 --> 01:45:35,870
it's like a Dojo in which they never,
it's everybody's training with everybody

2305
01:45:35,871 --> 01:45:37,160
else in the Dojo,
right?

2306
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:40,280
I told you it's all mushy.
Like the whole thing can be seen through

2307
01:45:40,281 --> 01:45:41,114
that Lens.
And then that this radical ideology 

2308
01:45:43,581 --> 01:45:47,540
coming in this area and wanting to 
redefine reality.

2309
01:45:47,570 --> 01:45:49,310
Absolutely.
In this area,

2310
01:45:49,550 --> 01:45:50,383
they're not,
they're not going out into the real 

2311
01:45:52,431 --> 01:45:53,264
world and experiencing the Congo and all
this crazy fucked up parts of the world 

2312
01:45:56,931 --> 01:45:57,764
and understanding like you're dealing 
with like an inherent problem with the 

2313
01:46:01,041 --> 01:46:01,874
human race.
Like you can't redefine it by changing 

2314
01:46:05,001 --> 01:46:05,834
pronouns and CIS gender.
It really is the most insidious form of 

2315
01:46:10,490 --> 01:46:11,323
Cultural Myopia.
Like they think they have latched onto 

2316
01:46:14,301 --> 01:46:15,134
some times they just making shit up.
They think they've latched onto some 

2317
01:46:18,291 --> 01:46:19,124
universal truth about reality and now 
they have this moral and I think that 

2318
01:46:24,171 --> 01:46:26,540
the,
the moral underlying moral impulses that

2319
01:46:26,541 --> 01:46:27,740
they have a pretty good ones.
You know,

2320
01:46:28,340 --> 01:46:31,050
you don't treat people differently on 
the basis of their licensing or you'd be

2321
01:46:31,090 --> 01:46:32,740
basically a cool person.
You will be asked.

2322
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:33,633
Yes.
I think that those are there being a 

2323
01:46:34,990 --> 01:46:35,823
laudable and forcing it.
They're not enforcing it with kindness 

2324
01:46:38,331 --> 01:46:39,164
and compassion and understanding and 
trying to promote this like positive 

2325
01:46:43,011 --> 01:46:45,170
thing.
Now they're shaming and docs.

2326
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:49,070
So that's the other piece that we need 
to understand here.

2327
01:46:49,290 --> 01:46:50,280
The other piece is

2328
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:51,113
the tactics and the techniques and these
people have really done a number on me 

2329
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:55,193
or they have attempted to they,
they mistake me for someone who gives a 

2330
01:46:57,361 --> 01:46:58,320
shit.
I really don't care.

2331
01:46:58,590 --> 01:47:03,590
But the other thing is these people are 
just the most mean spirited,

2332
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:06,800
nasty,
vituperative operative.

2333
01:47:07,900 --> 01:47:09,330
Tam,
you ever heard that one?

2334
01:47:09,810 --> 01:47:10,643
No.
It goes to the google that Google that 

2335
01:47:11,911 --> 01:47:16,240
vet to v VI.
T.

2336
01:47:16,240 --> 01:47:16,240
P.
R.

2337
01:47:16,240 --> 01:47:16,240
I.
T.

2338
01:47:16,240 --> 01:47:16,250
I.
Tiv Vituperative.

2339
01:47:16,250 --> 01:47:17,083
It means like,
you know a nasty name calling son of a 

2340
01:47:18,961 --> 01:47:21,300
bitch.
I'm going to call someone that one day.

2341
01:47:22,110 --> 01:47:24,360
Wow.
The two operative like it.

2342
01:47:24,530 --> 01:47:26,460
There you go.
Bitter of your day.

2343
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:27,870
Oh,
like it.

2344
01:47:27,900 --> 01:47:32,900
That's a good abusive or Tuper to fuck 
you can.

2345
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:34,433
These people are also characterized by 
the strategies they use with when they 

2346
01:47:39,241 --> 01:47:42,720
are engaging people.
The smear tactics,

2347
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:43,673
if you say anything,
if you question or you challenge your 

2348
01:47:45,421 --> 01:47:46,710
racist,
you're a bigot,

2349
01:47:46,830 --> 01:47:47,700
you're a homophobe.

2350
01:47:48,060 --> 01:47:51,150
But what that does is that shuts down 
the conversation.

2351
01:47:51,390 --> 01:47:55,740
That's the end of the conversation.
So they have marginally,

2352
01:47:55,770 --> 01:47:56,603
it's,
it really is that not only are they 

2353
01:47:57,631 --> 01:48:00,420
marginalize you,
it's this rise of the victim culture,

2354
01:48:00,510 --> 01:48:01,343
like every like victims or esteem.
Now I think I can find parallels when I 

2355
01:48:05,281 --> 01:48:10,281
was talking about again with mixed with 
martial arts is that like the Dojo to me

2356
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:15,870
was sacred because this was something 
that was transforming me and changing me

2357
01:48:15,871 --> 01:48:16,704
from a loser to someone who had like a 
possible outcome that was positive that 

2358
01:48:22,680 --> 01:48:24,600
I had potential.
I don't want a path out.

2359
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:25,793
I think a lot of these people,
they come from environments where maybe 

2360
01:48:28,801 --> 01:48:29,634
their parents were fucked up or racist 
or dumb or they didn't like their life 

2361
01:48:34,291 --> 01:48:36,720
or they've been raped or some kind of 
physical trauma.

2362
01:48:36,750 --> 01:48:37,800
Yes,
that's a good point.

2363
01:48:37,850 --> 01:48:40,530
Um,
had horrible experiences with bad people

2364
01:48:40,770 --> 01:48:42,380
or you know,
and you know,

2365
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:44,610
maybe abused in highschool,
bullied,

2366
01:48:44,611 --> 01:48:45,444
fucked with,
and now they found some culture where 

2367
01:48:47,161 --> 01:48:49,580
they're being not just accepted,
but the,

2368
01:48:49,581 --> 01:48:50,400
the,
it's,

2369
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:51,233
it's invigorating to them like other,
and then we're going to change this 

2370
01:48:54,181 --> 01:48:57,130
world and we're going to make things 
awesome for people and we're gonna,

2371
01:48:57,320 --> 01:48:58,153
you know,
we're going to make you ask people what 

2372
01:48:59,551 --> 01:49:01,320
their preferred gender pronouns are.

2373
01:49:01,350 --> 01:49:03,540
This is so important.
We really need to get on right.

2374
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:06,810
And they're there.
They're living in this environment.

2375
01:49:06,811 --> 01:49:07,644
And again,
you're dealing with a really young 

2376
01:49:08,251 --> 01:49:09,084
people like,
like I was when I was young and I was 

2377
01:49:11,221 --> 01:49:12,054
looking at this,
this stage of my life is this 

2378
01:49:13,861 --> 01:49:17,880
transformative journey that I was on and
I was wholeheartedly dedicated to it.

2379
01:49:18,810 --> 01:49:20,350
Maybe that's what they're doing.
You know,

2380
01:49:20,351 --> 01:49:22,530
this is their transformative journey.
Yeah.

2381
01:49:22,590 --> 01:49:26,760
I think that's right.
And I wasn't going on others.

2382
01:49:27,780 --> 01:49:28,970
Yeah,
they're imposing it there.

2383
01:49:29,210 --> 01:49:33,150
They're using the mechanisms of the 
university to impose those things.

2384
01:49:33,540 --> 01:49:34,373
I think that's right.
But the very things that we need reason 

2385
01:49:37,141 --> 01:49:39,690
and rationality or liberatory,
they can liberate us.

2386
01:49:39,691 --> 01:49:41,280
They can emancipate us.
You know,

2387
01:49:41,650 --> 01:49:42,990
again,
Jujitsu is like that.

2388
01:49:43,020 --> 01:49:44,760
You can test ideas,
you can,

2389
01:49:45,180 --> 01:49:45,960
you know,
it's like,

2390
01:49:45,960 --> 01:49:47,980
it's a son of a bitch to have a guy had 
a guy on

2391
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:48,813
me,
he's like 300 pounds and he's like knee 

2392
01:49:49,571 --> 01:49:51,490
ride me and then skull riding me.
I mean,

2393
01:49:51,491 --> 01:49:53,710
it's just not a very pleasant 
experience.

2394
01:49:53,711 --> 01:49:57,490
Those both sound very gay and be riding 
a skull riding.

2395
01:49:57,760 --> 01:49:59,640
That's a microaggression is a 
micrograph.

2396
01:50:00,190 --> 01:50:03,580
So I wanted to get back to that,
that protest,

2397
01:50:04,210 --> 01:50:06,250
because I don't think we completely 
finished it.

2398
01:50:06,760 --> 01:50:09,010
I was going to finish the thought that 
it was,

2399
01:50:09,100 --> 01:50:09,933
give me the protest.
W This woman that was saying all this 

2400
01:50:11,891 --> 01:50:15,340
stuff about you that you know you're 
racist and that you're like,

2401
01:50:15,341 --> 01:50:15,761
yeah,
okay.

2402
01:50:15,761 --> 01:50:18,400
So you know,
I used the word hurtful before.

2403
01:50:18,580 --> 01:50:19,413
So one of the reasons that's really 
hurtful to me is because my daughter's 

2404
01:50:22,210 --> 01:50:23,043
Asian,
right.

2405
01:50:23,170 --> 01:50:26,320
And now as the age of twitter,
and that's like saying I'm not racist.

2406
01:50:26,321 --> 01:50:28,330
I have black friends.
No,

2407
01:50:28,490 --> 01:50:29,171
no,
no.

2408
01:50:29,171 --> 01:50:30,970
It's different getting,
I know you're kidding,

2409
01:50:30,971 --> 01:50:31,630
but,
but,

2410
01:50:31,630 --> 01:50:33,970
but just think about,
just think about it for a second.

2411
01:50:34,390 --> 01:50:35,223
You know,
like my daughter grows up and this 

2412
01:50:36,430 --> 01:50:37,570
person in my class at,
Oh,

2413
01:50:37,571 --> 01:50:39,550
you know,
he's like hates Asians or whatever,

2414
01:50:40,750 --> 01:50:42,760
Asians,
I just like to guy like star Trek,

2415
01:50:42,761 --> 01:50:43,594
right?
So,

2416
01:50:43,810 --> 01:50:44,643
so you know,
those things tend to have a life of 

2417
01:50:47,081 --> 01:50:49,060
their own and then it's like,
oh,

2418
01:50:49,061 --> 01:50:51,400
but Goshen,
he's the guy who hates Asians,

2419
01:50:51,460 --> 01:50:52,630
right?
He's the guy.

2420
01:50:52,810 --> 01:50:53,650
Whereas,
no,

2421
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:56,650
I'm just the guy who,
and this is the earlier point,

2422
01:50:56,651 --> 01:51:01,210
I was going to make the very thing that 
these regressives one of the things that

2423
01:51:01,211 --> 01:51:02,200
they don't understand,
uh,

2424
01:51:02,230 --> 01:51:07,230
perhaps the most important is that 
reason is liberatory w we can emancipate

2425
01:51:07,481 --> 01:51:09,670
ourselves through reason and 
rationality,

2426
01:51:09,940 --> 01:51:12,610
but the only way to do that,
the weight,

2427
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:15,670
that reason acts as a lubricant is in 
social discourse.

2428
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:18,850
Like we need to be able to have 
conversations.

2429
01:51:19,120 --> 01:51:23,090
It's non negotiable.
Free speech is not a negotiation 100%.

2430
01:51:23,270 --> 01:51:25,720
It is pure.
And so these people,

2431
01:51:25,750 --> 01:51:26,583
they want to disinvite people if they 
don't agree with them as opposed to 

2432
01:51:29,021 --> 01:51:30,250
having,
you know,

2433
01:51:30,620 --> 01:51:31,453
uh,
an alternative speaker for their point 

2434
01:51:32,411 --> 01:51:34,720
of view or debate.
I'm not a fan of debates but you know,

2435
01:51:34,721 --> 01:51:37,450
or debate.
But what they want to do is they want to

2436
01:51:37,451 --> 01:51:38,284
shut down the discourse,
but let's take that at a deeper level 

2437
01:51:40,451 --> 01:51:43,510
and take a look at that.
Part of the problem with that is,

2438
01:51:44,230 --> 01:51:48,580
is that I firmly believe,
and I think I have evidence for this,

2439
01:51:48,581 --> 01:51:49,414
overwhelming evidence actually is a 
pedigree and long pedigree in western 

2440
01:51:52,961 --> 01:51:55,780
intellectual thought.
We can derive our values,

2441
01:51:56,020 --> 01:52:00,880
we can sit down and I can talk to you 
and we can figure out and looking at the

2442
01:52:00,940 --> 01:52:03,220
black statue there,
Hendrix there,

2443
01:52:03,460 --> 01:52:07,960
we can figure out why we shouldn't 
discriminate against people in the basis

2444
01:52:07,961 --> 01:52:08,794
of their skin color.

2445
01:52:08,890 --> 01:52:11,380
But the only way that we can do that,
it's not matte,

2446
01:52:11,410 --> 01:52:13,570
it doesn't come from a want,
is,

2447
01:52:13,630 --> 01:52:16,540
is that you need to be able to ask 
questions,

2448
01:52:16,630 --> 01:52:17,463
right?
So we can figure things out in 

2449
01:52:18,821 --> 01:52:20,110
discourse,
in dialog.

2450
01:52:20,230 --> 01:52:21,063
That's how we figure things out.
And these people want to shut down 

2451
01:52:23,741 --> 01:52:25,900
discourse.
But if they do that,

2452
01:52:26,170 --> 01:52:27,003
then they become their own enemies.
They're the worst type of idealog 

2453
01:52:30,520 --> 01:52:34,300
because they have beliefs,
but they haven't derived those beliefs.

2454
01:52:34,390 --> 01:52:37,120
So then those beliefs are then sacred,
right?

2455
01:52:37,121 --> 01:52:38,260
Yes,
yes,

2456
01:52:38,261 --> 01:52:40,330
yes.
And the only way they're,

2457
01:52:40,420 --> 01:52:45,420
they're taking away the one thing that 
we need to figure to figure stuff out.

2458
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:47,233
It's like they're in Jujitsu.
They're taking away the resisting 

2459
01:52:49,971 --> 01:52:51,080
opponent.
In this case,

2460
01:52:51,081 --> 01:52:53,000
they're taking away the dialectic,
the dialogue,

2461
01:52:53,001 --> 01:52:54,590
free speech,
open inquiry,

2462
01:52:54,980 --> 01:52:55,813
the ability to say things on campuses 
without being smeared as a racist or a 

2463
01:52:58,731 --> 01:52:59,930
homophobe or a bigot.

2464
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:02,420
You're 100% right.
You're 100% right.

2465
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:03,553
You couldn't be more right about that 
aspect of this whole dilemma that they 

2466
01:53:08,211 --> 01:53:09,044
are trying to stop the debate because I 
think part of them knows what they're 

2467
01:53:12,231 --> 01:53:13,064
doing is ridiculous.
Just like the the Ci Gong master that 

2468
01:53:15,681 --> 01:53:17,720
wants to shoot you across the room when 
there's a question,

2469
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:21,720
they kind of know they've got to know 
the question.

2470
01:53:21,770 --> 01:53:22,603
Right.
So that is what I've really been 

2471
01:53:24,081 --> 01:53:24,914
thinking about.
Do they know that their ideologies are 

2472
01:53:28,461 --> 01:53:30,230
bankrupt?
Do they know?

2473
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:31,153
I mean,
and,

2474
01:53:31,160 --> 01:53:33,800
and again,
I'm thinking about guys at the top,

2475
01:53:33,801 --> 01:53:34,760
like Reza,
Aslan,

2476
01:53:34,761 --> 01:53:35,390
green.
Glenn,

2477
01:53:35,390 --> 01:53:38,330
Glenn Greenwald,
Jank from the young Turks.

2478
01:53:38,331 --> 01:53:42,110
Like when you have to make shit up and 
lie,

2479
01:53:42,830 --> 01:53:46,490
it makes me think that you're not 
genuine about your beliefs,

2480
01:53:46,550 --> 01:53:50,810
that you're not authentic.
Like I would just mention to someone the

2481
01:53:50,810 --> 01:53:54,050
other day,
I have no problem talking to someone who

2482
01:53:54,051 --> 01:53:56,480
tells me with total sincerity,
hey,

2483
01:53:56,481 --> 01:53:57,314
you know what?

2484
01:53:57,410 --> 01:53:59,030
I believe that there was a talking 
snake.

2485
01:54:00,020 --> 01:54:01,730
Like I can have a conversation with that
guy.

2486
01:54:01,760 --> 01:54:02,850
He's sincere,
that Whoa,

2487
01:54:02,870 --> 01:54:04,330
that person's sincere.
They're,

2488
01:54:04,500 --> 01:54:06,350
you know,
they say this is what I believe,

2489
01:54:07,430 --> 01:54:08,263
but the regressives you can't,
it's almost impart the one thing you 

2490
01:54:12,441 --> 01:54:14,000
need.
You can't have a conversation.

2491
01:54:14,001 --> 01:54:15,590
Cause if you ask a question,
you're,

2492
01:54:15,770 --> 01:54:18,710
you're smeared you,
you become a whole smear campaign.

2493
01:54:18,980 --> 01:54:23,980
So it's incredibly frustrating on an 
individual level.

2494
01:54:24,530 --> 01:54:27,770
But then when they have institutional 
support of this stuff,

2495
01:54:28,010 --> 01:54:33,010
then when they have woven their 
tentacles into academia in,

2496
01:54:33,460 --> 01:54:34,500
into,
you know,

2497
01:54:34,550 --> 01:54:38,270
very high positions and it's across the 
United States,

2498
01:54:38,360 --> 01:54:39,530
western Europe.
And again,

2499
01:54:39,531 --> 01:54:42,650
remember there is a hierarchy of things 
you can't talk about.

2500
01:54:42,950 --> 01:54:43,783
You know,
th there is and if you want to figure 

2501
01:54:45,951 --> 01:54:48,380
something,
if you can figure out the relationship,

2502
01:54:48,590 --> 01:54:52,580
you mean this would be epic.
You figure out why.

2503
01:54:53,390 --> 01:54:54,223
I love my freedom of language with you 
here on the show and you figure out why 

2504
01:54:57,801 --> 01:54:58,634
of feminists are in bed with Islamists.
And then we got something because this 

2505
01:55:03,291 --> 01:55:07,700
to me is one of the most bizarre,
fascinating,

2506
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:10,550
disturbing,
grotesque.

2507
01:55:11,420 --> 01:55:14,150
I mean,
if there were ever a group who actively,

2508
01:55:14,180 --> 01:55:14,601
I mean,
you know,

2509
01:55:14,601 --> 01:55:17,750
it's even worse than the form Baltic 
states and the Soviet Union who,

2510
01:55:17,780 --> 01:55:18,613
the only military alliance in history,
their primary objective was to attack 

2511
01:55:21,051 --> 01:55:22,730
themselves.
This is even worse than that.

2512
01:55:22,910 --> 01:55:23,743
I mean these people,
you could not possibly find a group of 

2513
01:55:26,841 --> 01:55:27,674
people who are more antithetical to the 
most rudimentary feminist values than 

2514
01:55:33,081 --> 01:55:35,510
the Islamists.
It is not possible.

2515
01:55:35,540 --> 01:55:36,373
Never has it existed,
but yet these people are in bed with 

2516
01:55:39,351 --> 01:55:42,020
each other and it happens over and over 
again.

2517
01:55:42,530 --> 01:55:44,340
I mean,
this situation where you're laughing,

2518
01:55:44,340 --> 01:55:45,270
it's awesome.
I mean,

2519
01:55:45,390 --> 01:55:46,740
it's true.
It's just,

2520
01:55:46,770 --> 01:55:50,130
it's the poetry of the bizarre.
Yeah,

2521
01:55:50,131 --> 01:55:50,964
it is.
It's,

2522
01:55:51,350 --> 01:55:52,183
it's,
it's,

2523
01:55:52,260 --> 01:55:56,640
it's some bizarre folly.
It's very strange.

2524
01:55:56,940 --> 01:55:57,773
It's very strange,
but it's they're brown and you that you 

2525
01:55:59,941 --> 01:56:00,774
can't,
that's part of the bad about Brown 

2526
01:56:01,510 --> 01:56:04,110
people.
You can openly mock Christians.

2527
01:56:04,530 --> 01:56:05,690
Yeah,
that that's right you,

2528
01:56:05,691 --> 01:56:07,080
you can,
you can mock Christians.

2529
01:56:07,290 --> 01:56:08,123
There's something about a skin color 
that that trumps other things to think 

2530
01:56:13,231 --> 01:56:15,810
about that for a second.
These people,

2531
01:56:16,270 --> 01:56:18,270
the only people who care,
this isn't my line,

2532
01:56:18,271 --> 01:56:19,104
I read this somewhere,
but the only people who care about race 

2533
01:56:20,940 --> 01:56:24,990
are racists and regressive leftist.
These people are,

2534
01:56:24,991 --> 01:56:25,824
look,
the regressive left really are the new 

2535
01:56:27,871 --> 01:56:28,704
racist.
They were really looking at everything 

2536
01:56:30,181 --> 01:56:33,410
in terms of race and sex and I think 
there's a lot of sense of sex.

2537
01:56:33,420 --> 01:56:34,253
There's a lot of sexism in the 
regressive left because they don't 

2538
01:56:36,031 --> 01:56:36,864
really like men and there's a lot of 
anti unmasculine ideology that gets 

2539
01:56:40,051 --> 01:56:41,400
perpetrated on people.

2540
01:56:41,580 --> 01:56:46,350
The point where you thinking like you're
supposed to be more soft gendered,

2541
01:56:46,650 --> 01:56:47,483
gender supposed to be a fluid thing,
like you're not supposed to be overtly 

2542
01:56:49,921 --> 01:56:51,630
masculine.
That's nonsense.

2543
01:56:51,810 --> 01:56:55,410
How come you can be overtly feminine 
once you become transgender?

2544
01:56:55,470 --> 01:56:57,310
How come?
How come you,

2545
01:56:57,480 --> 01:57:00,330
if a woman wants to wear like a pushup 
Bra,

2546
01:57:00,331 --> 01:57:03,930
have our tits poking out in a short 
skirt and high heels and a lot of makeup

2547
01:57:03,931 --> 01:57:07,170
and do her hair up.
That girl's giving into the patriarchy,

2548
01:57:07,380 --> 01:57:10,050
but if a transgender does it,
you go,

2549
01:57:10,051 --> 01:57:10,884
girl.
If a transgender man all of a sudden 

2550
01:57:12,841 --> 01:57:15,630
adopts those traditionally feminine 
views,

2551
01:57:15,660 --> 01:57:16,493
it hypocrisy.
But it's even worse than hypocrisy 

2552
01:57:19,320 --> 01:57:21,450
because if it just stopped there,
it would be something.

2553
01:57:21,750 --> 01:57:22,583
But it's this idea that these people,
they think that they can dictate to 

2554
01:57:26,041 --> 01:57:28,110
other people how they should live.
Yeah.

2555
01:57:28,111 --> 01:57:31,050
When you see a guy who's a power lifter,
okay.

2556
01:57:31,050 --> 01:57:34,830
Some big fucking giant,
like you know that game of thrones,

2557
01:57:34,950 --> 01:57:36,460
the mountain guy,
the mountain guys.

2558
01:57:36,600 --> 01:57:38,280
I met that guy.
That's why I didn't say hi to him.

2559
01:57:38,281 --> 01:57:40,800
I saw him.
He was at the UFC this past weekend.

2560
01:57:40,820 --> 01:57:43,170
He's a fucking gigantic man.
It's huge.

2561
01:57:43,460 --> 01:57:45,190
He a whole thing with conor mcgregor.
Yeah.

2562
01:57:45,210 --> 01:57:46,110
Yeah.
It's awesome.

2563
01:57:46,200 --> 01:57:47,033
He obviously likes being fucking huge.
He enjoys picking shit up and moving it 

2564
01:57:51,211 --> 01:57:53,310
around.
He enjoys breaking records.

2565
01:57:53,490 --> 01:57:55,950
What do I give a fuck?
Why would I care?

2566
01:57:55,951 --> 01:57:58,470
He seems like a nice guy,
like the idea that this it,

2567
01:57:58,480 --> 01:57:59,840
even if he's an Asshole,
what?

2568
01:58:00,090 --> 01:58:01,140
Well,
here's the thing is,

2569
01:58:01,170 --> 01:58:02,970
but he's,
he doesn't seem to be,

2570
01:58:03,120 --> 01:58:05,880
and that my point is like there's no,
he's,

2571
01:58:06,180 --> 01:58:07,013
he's not doing anything terrible like,
but you would look at that and decide 

2572
01:58:12,241 --> 01:58:15,750
that this person living their life in 
this way is negative.

2573
01:58:15,751 --> 01:58:16,584
That he's masculine and he's a part of 
the problem and rape culture and all 

2574
01:58:20,071 --> 01:58:20,610
this Jay.
No,

2575
01:58:20,610 --> 01:58:25,610
he's just picking big shit up and moving
it around and flexing the most innocuous

2576
01:58:26,251 --> 01:58:26,731
thing,
right?

2577
01:58:26,731 --> 01:58:27,600
That blood could do.
Well,

2578
01:58:27,601 --> 01:58:28,434
why is it mean?
Why is it because he's overtly 

2579
01:58:30,541 --> 01:58:31,860
masculine?
Why is that bad?

2580
01:58:31,861 --> 01:58:32,694
Like what if he just put the same amount
of energy into swimming and this guy 

2581
01:58:35,671 --> 01:58:37,410
just like to swim across the fucking 
ocean?

2582
01:58:37,640 --> 01:58:39,150
Would you freak out about that?
No.

2583
01:58:39,151 --> 01:58:39,850
It's like,
it's,

2584
01:58:39,850 --> 01:58:44,530
it's this feeling,
this guy is becoming this thing that you

2585
01:58:44,531 --> 01:58:46,840
find impressive even if he's not doing 
any of that yet.

2586
01:58:46,980 --> 01:58:48,480
So,
so it's ticked.

2587
01:58:48,650 --> 01:58:49,483
So they're already a logs.
We got that and they subscribe to ideas 

2588
01:58:54,060 --> 01:58:56,430
that are just not in accordance with 
reality.

2589
01:58:56,640 --> 01:58:57,473
And I think,
and I'm not using the term regressive 

2590
01:58:59,311 --> 01:59:01,440
here,
I think general liberals in general tend

2591
01:59:01,441 --> 01:59:05,360
to believe that if we can change social 
system somehow and,

2592
01:59:05,390 --> 01:59:06,270
and,
and I,

2593
01:59:06,390 --> 01:59:08,220
I think that there's a lot of truth in 
this.

2594
01:59:08,590 --> 01:59:10,470
Uh,
Steven Steven pinker kind of,

2595
01:59:10,570 --> 01:59:11,700
uh,
in the blank slate,

2596
01:59:12,030 --> 01:59:12,863
deconstruct some of these ideas,
but liberals kind of think if you could 

2597
01:59:15,241 --> 01:59:16,074
only change the institutions in society,
then things would by definition be more 

2598
01:59:19,501 --> 01:59:20,334
fair and more equal.
We're all born blank slates and you 

2599
01:59:22,351 --> 01:59:23,184
know,
it's all of these disparities and 

2600
01:59:24,871 --> 01:59:26,910
inequality has come about as a result 
of,

2601
01:59:27,340 --> 01:59:28,173
uh,
problems within the system despite 

2602
01:59:29,880 --> 01:59:32,370
inequalities when the system and this 
look,

2603
01:59:33,790 --> 01:59:36,000
unless you are really an ideolog on the 
right,

2604
01:59:37,020 --> 01:59:39,840
you would be hard pressed to say,
you know,

2605
01:59:40,950 --> 01:59:41,783
why,
why shouldn't we try to do our best to 

2606
01:59:43,891 --> 01:59:45,840
create systems of justice that are more 
fair?

2607
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:50,730
I'm a big Fan of John Ralston.
Any reasonable person would say that,

2608
01:59:51,090 --> 01:59:56,090
but these people,
they don't believe in differences be,

2609
01:59:56,790 --> 01:59:59,060
they think that they're,
they're non bile.

2610
01:59:59,100 --> 02:00:02,490
The differences between men and women 
are not biological.

2611
02:00:02,550 --> 02:00:04,410
They think that their cultural 
artifacts,

2612
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:06,030
they think that,
you know,

2613
02:00:06,170 --> 02:00:07,800
and I don't know if you want to get the 
whole race thing,

2614
02:00:07,801 --> 02:00:08,634
but the race thing is another thing.
But they think that race is only skin 

2615
02:00:10,771 --> 02:00:12,780
deep there.
It's a social construct.

2616
02:00:12,990 --> 02:00:14,220
You know,
rather than saying,

2617
02:00:14,221 --> 02:00:15,054
well,
why do Jewish women get [inaudible] 

2618
02:00:15,780 --> 02:00:16,890
syndrome?
Wider Black Guy,

2619
02:00:16,891 --> 02:00:19,080
black people get more sickle cell 
anemia.

2620
02:00:19,520 --> 02:00:20,580
Um,
but again,

2621
02:00:20,670 --> 02:00:21,210
you know,
I,

2622
02:00:21,210 --> 02:00:25,880
I notice my hesitancy in discussing 
these things because I know that anytime

2623
02:00:25,890 --> 02:00:26,723
you bring this up,
this is an opportunity for people to 

2624
02:00:29,071 --> 02:00:30,900
smear.
You tell you you're a bigot,

2625
02:00:30,970 --> 02:00:33,710
a racist or a homophobe and,
and,

2626
02:00:33,780 --> 02:00:34,613
oh,
and it's also the pinnacle of identity 

2627
02:00:36,001 --> 02:00:36,834
politics where the things that I say are
discredited or they look at me because 

2628
02:00:42,331 --> 02:00:43,164
I'm,
I'm situated in the body than I am for 

2629
02:00:45,061 --> 02:00:45,750
the sexuality.

2630
02:00:45,750 --> 02:00:46,583
I had no choice over whatsoever.
And they used that as an opportunity to 

2631
02:00:49,831 --> 02:00:53,160
discredit my speech.
I mean the whole thing is just,

2632
02:00:53,190 --> 02:00:55,890
it's,
it is literally if you could say,

2633
02:00:55,920 --> 02:00:58,590
well let's,
let's make a list of all the things that

2634
02:00:58,591 --> 02:01:01,620
we can write down to make it impossible 
to solve our problems.

2635
02:01:01,740 --> 02:01:03,480
These people,
they have the list.

2636
02:01:03,600 --> 02:01:06,090
I mean they have the gold standard for 
the list.

2637
02:01:06,870 --> 02:01:08,610
Yeah,
it's a very good point.

2638
02:01:08,700 --> 02:01:09,533
I mean I think one of the most important
aspects of this is what you said about 

2639
02:01:14,041 --> 02:01:17,580
silencing debate and that debate and 
discussion

2640
02:01:17,700 --> 02:01:20,340
is the only way we figure things out.
And I don't know,

2641
02:01:20,580 --> 02:01:23,130
I've met you today.
I know you because of your work.

2642
02:01:23,131 --> 02:01:25,500
I know you because of your associations 
with friends of mine,

2643
02:01:25,501 --> 02:01:26,334
like Sam Harris.
But I don't know your thinking until I 

2644
02:01:30,181 --> 02:01:32,280
talked to you and when I talked to you I
go,

2645
02:01:32,700 --> 02:01:33,121
oh,
okay,

2646
02:01:33,121 --> 02:01:36,150
I see how he sees that.
Or he sees things in a different way and

2647
02:01:36,151 --> 02:01:36,984
it's hard for people to do that because 
we have this rigid set ideas that we 

2648
02:01:39,951 --> 02:01:40,130
have

2649
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:40,963
in our head and we would like to 
reinforce those on everybody because it 

2650
02:01:42,531 --> 02:01:43,700
makes life simpler.
Well,

2651
02:01:43,701 --> 02:01:44,534
if you think the way I think,
and I think the way you think it's 

2652
02:01:45,920 --> 02:01:46,753
perfect,
right?

2653
02:01:46,790 --> 02:01:48,590
So that's when we bring Jujitsu and 
again,

2654
02:01:48,591 --> 02:01:49,424
right?
So that's why the problem is when we 

2655
02:01:51,771 --> 02:01:54,590
hang out with people who only believe 
like we do,

2656
02:01:54,790 --> 02:01:57,070
it's called the filter bubble.
Uh,

2657
02:01:57,120 --> 02:01:59,220
and the,
and it's a book about it called the beat

2658
02:01:59,330 --> 02:02:00,163
big sort.
We tend to be more confident in the 

2659
02:02:01,911 --> 02:02:03,790
beliefs that we have,
right?

2660
02:02:04,070 --> 02:02:07,400
But what we should be doing is we should
be going to different gyms,

2661
02:02:07,670 --> 02:02:08,503
right?
You should be going as your buddy to 

2662
02:02:09,990 --> 02:02:10,823
10th planet,
you should be going and checking out 

2663
02:02:12,321 --> 02:02:13,154
different things because you need to 
test these ideas to see if they work in 

2664
02:02:17,541 --> 02:02:20,180
the same way we should be listening to 
ideas.

2665
02:02:20,270 --> 02:02:21,103
It's a problem if you're a liberal and 
you only listen to liberal stuff or an 

2666
02:02:24,711 --> 02:02:25,544
atheist and you only listen.
You really need to listen to challenge 

2667
02:02:28,281 --> 02:02:29,114
and engage yourself by opening yourself 
up to these experiences and starting 

2668
02:02:32,541 --> 02:02:34,850
with the possibility that you could be 
wrong.

2669
02:02:34,940 --> 02:02:35,773
So if you're a black belt in Brazilian 
Jujitsu and you walk into someone's 

2670
02:02:39,191 --> 02:02:41,930
school and the blue belts are routinely 
tapping you do,

2671
02:02:41,990 --> 02:02:43,470
you got to do some thinking.
Yeah,

2672
02:02:43,510 --> 02:02:44,343
you're going to be honest with yourself 
and it doesn't matter how much time 

2673
02:02:46,911 --> 02:02:47,744
you've put into it,
it doesn't matter what your commitment 

2674
02:02:49,251 --> 02:02:51,320
is,
what matters is what works.

2675
02:02:51,350 --> 02:02:52,183
Yeah,
that's it.

2676
02:02:52,400 --> 02:02:56,750
That's it.
And that is a beautiful thing about high

2677
02:02:56,751 --> 02:03:00,050
level problem solving in martial arts 
that if it works,

2678
02:03:00,080 --> 02:03:02,270
it works.
And it's,

2679
02:03:02,320 --> 02:03:03,153
it's hard to do that when it comes to 
ideas like compassion and justice and 

2680
02:03:07,940 --> 02:03:08,773
getting along and how you should treat 
people and how people should be 

2681
02:03:11,421 --> 02:03:12,230
accepted.

2682
02:03:12,230 --> 02:03:13,430
And you know,
there's,

2683
02:03:13,580 --> 02:03:14,413
there's things about diversity and about
a quality that I think we all agree 

2684
02:03:20,631 --> 02:03:21,464
with.
I mean I think you shouldn't be judged 

2685
02:03:23,031 --> 02:03:28,031
by your sexuality or what you look like 
or where you were born or you know,

2686
02:03:28,731 --> 02:03:29,564
fill in the blank.
Nationalism seems to be kind of fucking 

2687
02:03:31,671 --> 02:03:32,504
silly to me.
I think you should judge people on how 

2688
02:03:35,031 --> 02:03:38,180
you behave and how you interact with 
each other and be like,

2689
02:03:38,360 --> 02:03:40,580
do I enjoy talking to this person?
And guess what?

2690
02:03:40,850 --> 02:03:41,683
You might enjoy talking to me,
but somebody else might fucking think 

2691
02:03:43,731 --> 02:03:45,590
I'm a moron.
They might not like talk to me.

2692
02:03:45,591 --> 02:03:47,930
And that's their prerogative to.
They can.

2693
02:03:48,140 --> 02:03:50,980
You don't have to just because you like 
Peter Boghossian.

2694
02:03:50,990 --> 02:03:53,780
Just because you enjoy people,
it doesn't mean I have to enjoy them.

2695
02:03:53,990 --> 02:03:55,460
You know,
I have friends that have friends.

2696
02:03:55,461 --> 02:03:57,500
I can't fucking stand,
you know,

2697
02:03:57,501 --> 02:03:59,480
and I'll be around like,
oh Christ,

2698
02:03:59,481 --> 02:04:00,600
why are you hanging around with this 
guy?

2699
02:04:00,600 --> 02:04:02,270
He gives me headaches.
I gotta get Outta here.

2700
02:04:02,271 --> 02:04:04,070
And the the older,
yeah,

2701
02:04:04,071 --> 02:04:06,290
the older I get,
the more I,

2702
02:04:06,340 --> 02:04:07,880
I just want to spend my time with 
people.

2703
02:04:07,881 --> 02:04:10,240
I really want to spend money and not 
obligations.

2704
02:04:10,241 --> 02:04:11,074
You can't fix people.
I've tried so fucking hard to get along 

2705
02:04:14,481 --> 02:04:15,314
with people that are unmotivated or lazy
or they have constant problems in their 

2706
02:04:19,221 --> 02:04:20,054
life.
They don't look at themselves objective 

2707
02:04:21,441 --> 02:04:22,274
Lee.
And you talk to them about things that 

2708
02:04:23,721 --> 02:04:26,480
happen in their life and they have a 
fucking myriad of excuses.

2709
02:04:26,900 --> 02:04:29,840
It's overwhelming and that you,
if you have those people in your life,

2710
02:04:29,870 --> 02:04:30,703
they will overwhelm you with their 
issues and you will never get anything 

2711
02:04:34,041 --> 02:04:34,874
done.
And so my take is try until you can't 

2712
02:04:38,611 --> 02:04:40,760
try and then get the fuck out of there.
Yeah.

2713
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:42,480
And you,
you're already doing what you're doing.

2714
02:04:42,481 --> 02:04:44,280
And is that you're modeling those 
behaviors.

2715
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:45,290
You know,
when my,

2716
02:04:45,290 --> 02:04:46,950
I was just talking to my buddy the other
day,

2717
02:04:46,980 --> 02:04:47,813
he's,
he's upset that all their aggressives 

2718
02:04:49,411 --> 02:04:51,300
are attacking him.
And I just said,

2719
02:04:51,330 --> 02:04:52,470
just,
I'll publish everybody.

2720
02:04:53,140 --> 02:04:54,960
No,
that's the currency in academia.

2721
02:04:55,050 --> 02:04:55,883
Like what do you care,
like just publish and explain your 

2722
02:04:58,591 --> 02:05:02,730
thoughts in a way that will inspire 
debate and aspire thought.

2723
02:05:03,030 --> 02:05:07,800
Explain your thoughts in a blog in a way
where people can read it and like it and

2724
02:05:08,460 --> 02:05:09,293
share it with friends.
And that's one of the beautiful things 

2725
02:05:10,441 --> 02:05:11,274
about today is that you have this 
ability that's never literally 

2726
02:05:16,110 --> 02:05:19,260
unparalleled access to other human 
beings.

2727
02:05:19,261 --> 02:05:21,900
It's never been like this where you 
could just write something.

2728
02:05:21,930 --> 02:05:22,763
You put it on facebook.
You could be a carpenter in Kansas and 

2729
02:05:27,331 --> 02:05:28,164
you write something beautiful on 
facebook and it'll be shared across the 

2730
02:05:31,741 --> 02:05:34,020
world within minutes.
Yeah.

2731
02:05:34,021 --> 02:05:34,854
I'll add one more thing to that and 
don't treat people if you've been 

2732
02:05:38,071 --> 02:05:40,410
treated negatively by people.
Don't stoop to that.

2733
02:05:40,530 --> 02:05:41,490
It's hard.
Right?

2734
02:05:41,550 --> 02:05:43,190
It's hard for people.
Yeah.

2735
02:05:43,290 --> 02:05:44,850
My Mentor,
my mentor,

2736
02:05:45,070 --> 02:05:45,903
this is somewhat of a of a non sequitur,
but my metro told me this really fast 

2737
02:05:49,450 --> 02:05:51,080
Dalai Lama story.
No,

2738
02:05:51,540 --> 02:05:52,640
no.
The Pope No.

2739
02:05:54,050 --> 02:05:56,040
Did the one that just got rid of right.
Then what?

2740
02:05:56,041 --> 02:05:58,530
The child molester pope,
he told me he was a,

2741
02:05:58,540 --> 02:06:01,820
he's 97 and he's a survivor of a book 
involved.

2742
02:06:02,860 --> 02:06:03,693
Yeah.
It's a really amazing guys that Phil 

2743
02:06:05,160 --> 02:06:07,170
about his life and he went back and 
liberated the same,

2744
02:06:07,171 --> 02:06:07,280
yeah,
same

2745
02:06:07,280 --> 02:06:11,060
concentration camp told me the story 
about chickens.

2746
02:06:11,270 --> 02:06:14,780
That was a very profound in my life.
Basically.

2747
02:06:14,930 --> 02:06:17,120
I think he was on the study.
If not then,

2748
02:06:17,480 --> 02:06:19,280
but it doesn't make a difference.
Basically they,

2749
02:06:19,340 --> 02:06:22,580
they wanted to see if they could reverse
the pecking order among chickens.

2750
02:06:23,150 --> 02:06:26,330
And there's something that's a literal 
pecking order.

2751
02:06:26,331 --> 02:06:28,820
And then if you put chickens in a coop,
seven chickens,

2752
02:06:29,150 --> 02:06:32,240
chicken,
one will peck chicken to chicken,

2753
02:06:32,241 --> 02:06:36,380
one would pet chickens two through seven
but never be picked chicken too will not

2754
02:06:36,381 --> 02:06:38,240
pet chicken one.
But we'll pick,

2755
02:06:38,241 --> 02:06:40,320
check it patrick.
So the same thing all the way down.

2756
02:06:40,430 --> 02:06:44,630
Chick chicken seven gets packed by all 
the chickens and pex nobody.

2757
02:06:45,170 --> 02:06:47,600
So they wanted to see if they could 
reverse the pecking order.

2758
02:06:48,050 --> 02:06:51,380
And I think that this story has profound
implications for all of life.

2759
02:06:51,860 --> 02:06:53,870
And so what they did was they put a 
little color,

2760
02:06:54,020 --> 02:06:57,680
they put little collars on all the 
chickens and when the chicken raised his

2761
02:06:57,681 --> 02:07:00,260
head as if it was going to pack into the
chicken,

2762
02:07:00,410 --> 02:07:01,243
they zapped it.

2763
02:07:01,820 --> 02:07:04,790
Now here's the question to you,
and I got it wrong.

2764
02:07:04,791 --> 02:07:05,624
When he asked me,
do you think it was easier to make 

2765
02:07:08,031 --> 02:07:08,864
chicken one chicken seven or chicken 
seven chicken one chicken seven chicken 

2766
02:07:12,651 --> 02:07:13,221
one.
See,

2767
02:07:13,221 --> 02:07:14,420
that's what I said.
That's wrong.

2768
02:07:14,750 --> 02:07:18,170
And here's the reasoning for that 
chicken seven has been,

2769
02:07:19,070 --> 02:07:23,880
has been,
I'm not plugged duct correct peck,

2770
02:07:23,910 --> 02:07:26,240
peck,
thanks has been pecked at whole life.

2771
02:07:26,480 --> 02:07:27,313
It's,
it's,

2772
02:07:27,410 --> 02:07:31,340
it's all only going to get packed and 
only takes one shock.

2773
02:07:31,370 --> 02:07:32,570
And I'll tell you another very quick 
story.

2774
02:07:32,780 --> 02:07:37,630
It only takes one shock of chicken,
one to make a chicken seven instantly.

2775
02:07:37,750 --> 02:07:38,500
Really?
Yeah,

2776
02:07:38,500 --> 02:07:41,200
because it's never experienced that.
That's why,

2777
02:07:41,500 --> 02:07:43,300
for example,
in the criminal justice system,

2778
02:07:43,480 --> 02:07:46,090
harsh punishments don't work.
They just don't.

2779
02:07:46,091 --> 02:07:48,160
And that's borne out by overwhelming 
empirical evidence.

2780
02:07:48,161 --> 02:07:51,910
But I think a theoretical background for
that is the chicken story.

2781
02:07:52,360 --> 02:07:55,600
That's why like my,
he was telling me that when his son,

2782
02:07:55,630 --> 02:07:56,463
he never yelled at his son is a funny 
story looking at you with all the 

2783
02:07:58,451 --> 02:07:59,284
tattoos and his son wanted to get a 
tattoo and he slammed his hand down and 

2784
02:08:02,621 --> 02:08:03,490
he said No.

2785
02:08:03,640 --> 02:08:06,070
And he screamed and his son was so 
shocked.

2786
02:08:06,160 --> 02:08:10,240
It was like such a shocking thing 
because he had never raised his voice.

2787
02:08:10,241 --> 02:08:12,880
He always been chicken one,
you know he had always been,

2788
02:08:13,390 --> 02:08:17,800
but when you really start to think about
the implications of that,

2789
02:08:18,070 --> 02:08:21,370
of what kindness will do,
of what,

2790
02:08:21,850 --> 02:08:22,683
of why being,
there's your word again for two 

2791
02:08:24,971 --> 02:08:25,960
creative,
nasty,

2792
02:08:25,961 --> 02:08:26,794
harsh to people.
The best way to change moral attitudes 

2793
02:08:29,380 --> 02:08:31,600
is through rapport.
The best way to help people,

2794
02:08:31,601 --> 02:08:32,434
and if you read the the Christian books,
they talk about this interesting book 

2795
02:08:35,801 --> 02:08:40,090
called tactics and the main thing is,
you know,

2796
02:08:40,091 --> 02:08:42,460
develop relationships with people.
They're friendly,

2797
02:08:42,461 --> 02:08:43,294
they're kind,
they're trustworthy of communities with 

2798
02:08:45,041 --> 02:08:45,874
people and that gets them involved in 
their community and thus their faith 

2799
02:08:49,930 --> 02:08:51,400
based blood.
Same thing with Jujitsu.

2800
02:08:51,401 --> 02:08:52,234
I have like some great guys I was just 
hanging out with the other day who do 

2801
02:08:53,961 --> 02:08:54,794
Jujitsu.

2802
02:08:54,940 --> 02:08:55,773
Jujitsu is also interesting just 
parenthetically because you have such a 

2803
02:08:59,471 --> 02:09:03,400
trust of the people you work out with.
I mean you have a bond.

2804
02:09:03,520 --> 02:09:08,110
A buddy of mine is a prosecutor for the 
state and you know how you have to say,

2805
02:09:08,111 --> 02:09:09,190
Hey,
I know this guy.

2806
02:09:09,310 --> 02:09:10,143
When he knew another guy who's also a 
friend of mine and they did Jujitsu 

2807
02:09:12,431 --> 02:09:16,120
together and he told the judge and the 
lawyer and they said they have,

2808
02:09:16,150 --> 02:09:19,720
they don't have a problem with it.
Neither one of those people do Jujitsu.

2809
02:09:20,350 --> 02:09:21,183
Right.
Because there's no freaking way that I 

2810
02:09:22,871 --> 02:09:23,704
would let someone do Jujitsu,
sit on a jury with somebody else who's 

2811
02:09:28,240 --> 02:09:29,630
either the prosecutor,
the defender,

2812
02:09:29,631 --> 02:09:30,464
because those people trust each other 
because you have to trust each other 

2813
02:09:33,010 --> 02:09:35,730
when you do Jujitsu or people will break
your arm still choke deck.

2814
02:09:35,731 --> 02:09:39,070
You're also part of a very tight knit 
and unusual community.

2815
02:09:39,070 --> 02:09:39,903
Absolutely.
You have this bond with each other that 

2816
02:09:41,711 --> 02:09:44,770
I don't think people understand your,
your practice and killing each other.

2817
02:09:44,830 --> 02:09:45,700
Yeah,
that's right.

2818
02:09:45,730 --> 02:09:46,563
Yeah.
You're practicing breaking each other's 

2819
02:09:47,531 --> 02:09:48,190
arms.
Yeah.

2820
02:09:48,190 --> 02:09:50,740
So I think that that,
that chicken story,

2821
02:09:50,741 --> 02:09:55,741
and I told that because often we think 
that the best response to be when,

2822
02:09:56,670 --> 02:10:00,040
when we're being mistreated or we 
perceive an injustice or unfairness just

2823
02:10:00,041 --> 02:10:04,570
to lash out and a type of emotional 
maturity is just to not lash out.

2824
02:10:04,990 --> 02:10:05,823
You know,
maybe a really good strategy which I've 

2825
02:10:08,351 --> 02:10:10,900
adopted instead of,
it's certainly much easier than,

2826
02:10:10,930 --> 02:10:14,890
than attempting to do the emotional work
of being kind and compassionate is just,

2827
02:10:14,891 --> 02:10:15,724
just ignore people.
You don't have to meet their nastiness 

2828
02:10:18,161 --> 02:10:20,080
with nastiness.
You just walk away.

2829
02:10:20,730 --> 02:10:22,630
Well that's a good approach.
If he could pull it off,

2830
02:10:22,660 --> 02:10:25,690
sometimes people get pissed off,
told you like fuck this guy.

2831
02:10:25,900 --> 02:10:28,930
Ah,
but I think that also is what I call the

2832
02:10:28,931 --> 02:10:32,080
battery effect.
And it's also a good aspect of Jujitsu.

2833
02:10:32,590 --> 02:10:34,040
I think beings have

2834
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:34,873
a certain amount of energy that they 
store up in their body because I think 

2835
02:10:37,010 --> 02:10:39,140
we have,
our bodies are,

2836
02:10:39,560 --> 02:10:40,393
we have this ancient structure that it's
been passed on from generation to 

2837
02:10:44,181 --> 02:10:45,014
generation,
thousands and thousands of years of 

2838
02:10:46,791 --> 02:10:47,624
human beings.
And for the most part up until really 

2839
02:10:50,331 --> 02:10:51,164
recently you were constantly engaged in 
physical activity and conflict and your 

2840
02:10:55,101 --> 02:10:55,934
body is designed for that.
And I believe your body has a certain 

2841
02:10:58,550 --> 02:11:01,040
amount of requirements for the 
expenditure of energy.

2842
02:11:01,070 --> 02:11:03,110
And when you don't meet those 
requirements,

2843
02:11:03,290 --> 02:11:06,680
your battery overflows.
And I think that's what road rage is.

2844
02:11:06,681 --> 02:11:07,880
And I think that's what,
uh,

2845
02:11:07,900 --> 02:11:08,733
irrational responses.
And I know personally from my own 

2846
02:11:10,971 --> 02:11:15,590
experience in my own shortcomings when I
have had irrational responses is because

2847
02:11:15,770 --> 02:11:16,603
I have not maintained my body correctly 
and I have not taken care of that 

2848
02:11:18,921 --> 02:11:21,560
battery.
And then when it comes up,

2849
02:11:21,561 --> 02:11:22,394
especially when you're someone like me,
it's even more consequential because 

2850
02:11:25,131 --> 02:11:26,360
I've done it my whole life.

2851
02:11:26,650 --> 02:11:29,360
So my whole life has been about 
exploding,

2852
02:11:29,390 --> 02:11:30,260
punching,
kicking.

2853
02:11:30,370 --> 02:11:33,260
I'm just all look kettlebells,
Jujitsu,

2854
02:11:33,770 --> 02:11:35,320
there's all this,
Rah,

2855
02:11:35,320 --> 02:11:35,320
Rah,
Rah,

2856
02:11:35,320 --> 02:11:36,650
Rah.
And in doing that,

2857
02:11:36,651 --> 02:11:38,990
if I get it out of my system,
I'm tranquil.

2858
02:11:39,380 --> 02:11:40,213
Everything's calm.
But when I don't get out of my system 

2859
02:11:41,401 --> 02:11:42,350
was about my body.
It's like,

2860
02:11:42,440 --> 02:11:44,290
I think this is an opportunity to go 
fuck a class.

2861
02:11:45,860 --> 02:11:47,750
You got all this extra,
you know what I mean?

2862
02:11:47,751 --> 02:11:48,830
It's like if you bought,
he's like,

2863
02:11:48,831 --> 02:11:50,380
come on bitch.
You're like,

2864
02:11:50,381 --> 02:11:51,680
it's,
it's stored up.

2865
02:11:51,710 --> 02:11:53,600
You've got too much juice in your 
battery.

2866
02:11:53,990 --> 02:11:57,620
And Jujitsu people for the most part are
some of the most mellow,

2867
02:11:57,621 --> 02:11:58,454
calm and relaxed people outside of it.
They also have the benefit of knowing 

2868
02:12:02,840 --> 02:12:06,470
that the average person literally has no
idea how to defend themselves.

2869
02:12:06,630 --> 02:12:07,463
We know this because we have been 
personally humiliated as an average 

2870
02:12:10,881 --> 02:12:11,714
person going into Jujitsu and then you 
become a practitioner and you become 

2871
02:12:15,020 --> 02:12:17,720
fairly proficient and then you 
understand your limitations,

2872
02:12:17,721 --> 02:12:21,380
but you also understand much more deeply
the limitations of the average person.

2873
02:12:21,470 --> 02:12:22,080
Absolutely.
No,

2874
02:12:22,080 --> 02:12:22,891
you,
you haven't.

2875
02:12:22,891 --> 02:12:23,724
Having an at from my perspective and 
encyclopedic knowledge of martial arts 

2876
02:12:26,631 --> 02:12:29,900
and lineages and people in my 
experience,

2877
02:12:30,170 --> 02:12:32,150
the people I've met like,
like,

2878
02:12:32,390 --> 02:12:33,440
uh,
you know,

2879
02:12:33,500 --> 02:12:35,990
um,
I'm trying to think of,

2880
02:12:36,050 --> 02:12:37,610
uh,
um,

2881
02:12:37,940 --> 02:12:39,800
John Kavanagh I'd be a good example.
He's a very,

2882
02:12:39,830 --> 02:12:41,450
very deep,
have you ever role with John?

2883
02:12:41,480 --> 02:12:42,590
No.
He's very good.

2884
02:12:42,620 --> 02:12:44,630
Like he's extraordinarily good.
I'm sure he is.

2885
02:12:44,660 --> 02:12:45,650
Yeah.
He's a great guy.

2886
02:12:45,920 --> 02:12:46,753
He's a super good guy.
The people you meet who are just the 

2887
02:12:49,671 --> 02:12:51,710
most dangerous,
deadly people,

2888
02:12:51,890 --> 02:12:53,180
they're just,
they got nothing to prove.

2889
02:12:53,210 --> 02:12:54,043
Yeah.
They seem to be the nicest people you 

2890
02:12:55,221 --> 02:12:57,380
ever met Marcella Garcia?
No.

2891
02:12:57,410 --> 02:13:01,010
He's the sweetest of sweeties.
He's just like a smiling,

2892
02:13:01,011 --> 02:13:02,950
happy assassin.
Yeah.

2893
02:13:02,960 --> 02:13:04,610
When you're around him,
he's so nice.

2894
02:13:04,640 --> 02:13:06,350
He's just such a nice guy.
And Yeah,

2895
02:13:06,351 --> 02:13:07,184
when you're around them,
my friend Eddie Bravo is fucking nicest 

2896
02:13:08,931 --> 02:13:10,520
guy ever.
He's always nice.

2897
02:13:10,850 --> 02:13:11,450
Yeah.
And then,

2898
02:13:11,450 --> 02:13:13,730
and then as I went out to a bar a little
while ago,

2899
02:13:13,790 --> 02:13:14,623
and a guy had a black belt around his 
waist as a belt and he was playing pool 

2900
02:13:20,060 --> 02:13:23,690
and I thought to myself,
this guy has some issues.

2901
02:13:23,720 --> 02:13:27,290
It was a dangling a,
you know how you tie a belt around a g?

2902
02:13:27,470 --> 02:13:28,970
He was tied it around his pants like 
that.

2903
02:13:28,971 --> 02:13:29,890
So like,
like the,

2904
02:13:29,970 --> 02:13:31,980
the,
the two were dangling like

2905
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:32,813
a black belt with me.
So he wanted to let everybody know that 

2906
02:13:34,291 --> 02:13:35,480
he's a black belt.
You know,

2907
02:13:35,490 --> 02:13:37,740
you just buy a black belt.
That's the other thing I tell people,

2908
02:13:37,741 --> 02:13:38,574
like,
like you can get a black belt from like 

2909
02:13:39,990 --> 02:13:42,750
online,
you buy them and then they come and then

2910
02:13:42,751 --> 02:13:44,380
you put it on.
Like you don't have to earn it.

2911
02:13:44,381 --> 02:13:47,280
It's not like,
it's like a sacred forging ground,

2912
02:13:47,460 --> 02:13:50,850
black belts where there's only one way 
to just pay a lot of money.

2913
02:13:50,950 --> 02:13:53,640
You don't even have to fucking do a 
fantasy martial art.

2914
02:13:53,760 --> 02:13:56,130
You could just be a regular guy or a 
black belt.

2915
02:13:56,880 --> 02:13:57,930
I mean,
you literally can,

2916
02:13:57,931 --> 02:13:59,730
there was a video really recently.
I mean,

2917
02:13:59,731 --> 02:14:00,564
it still does happen to this day.
If some guy showing up at a Brazilian 

2918
02:14:03,331 --> 02:14:05,580
Jujitsu school,
he puts on a game,

2919
02:14:05,850 --> 02:14:09,240
I think he had a wrestling shoes on and 
a black belt and a,

2920
02:14:09,270 --> 02:14:12,450
he showed up at this gym and he started 
a working out with people.

2921
02:14:12,450 --> 02:14:13,283
And then the instructor realized 
immediately that this guy was not a 

2922
02:14:16,291 --> 02:14:17,124
black belt and humiliated him and punish
him and tell him to take the belt off 

2923
02:14:20,731 --> 02:14:23,280
and get the fuck outta here.
And he was screaming at him.

2924
02:14:23,340 --> 02:14:25,290
But see,
that's the beauty of Jujitsu too,

2925
02:14:25,291 --> 02:14:27,330
is you can't pretend,
cannot pretend.

2926
02:14:27,420 --> 02:14:29,610
Yeah.
You can pretend in some martial arts,

2927
02:14:30,090 --> 02:14:33,870
I mean there's guys that invent moves 
that they think,

2928
02:14:33,871 --> 02:14:34,704
like with this,
one of my favorite videos as these guys 

2929
02:14:36,151 --> 02:14:38,730
in Harlem,
it's not videos.

2930
02:14:38,731 --> 02:14:41,200
There's a series of them who practice 
some,

2931
02:14:41,250 --> 02:14:45,030
some sort of fake Kung Fu.
And like one guy will,

2932
02:14:45,031 --> 02:14:46,110
uh,
will be like,

2933
02:14:46,140 --> 02:14:48,810
he'll throw a punch and then the other 
guy will go,

2934
02:14:48,811 --> 02:14:50,690
well if someone does that to me when I'm
going to do is,

2935
02:14:50,760 --> 02:14:51,340
um,
they,

2936
02:14:51,340 --> 02:14:54,240
they don't say it like this.
They say it in a very urban way.

2937
02:14:54,240 --> 02:14:55,800
Like not,
I'm not,

2938
02:14:55,801 --> 02:14:56,634
I'm not,
that shit ain't gonna work cause I'm 

2939
02:14:57,121 --> 02:15:00,090
gonna step over here and I'm attack with
a chicken wing and then I got a,

2940
02:15:00,091 --> 02:15:00,924
I got a monkey Paul and they invent all 
this stuff on my attack your ribs for 

2941
02:15:03,901 --> 02:15:04,734
this position.
And then their guys also in on it 

2942
02:15:06,211 --> 02:15:07,980
because they're also practicing 
bullshit.

2943
02:15:08,260 --> 02:15:09,001
It's like,
oh yeah,

2944
02:15:09,001 --> 02:15:09,451
yeah,
yeah.

2945
02:15:09,451 --> 02:15:11,040
I see how that would work.
Well,

2946
02:15:11,090 --> 02:15:11,923
what's hilarious is sometimes these guys
actually have fights and when they have 

2947
02:15:16,231 --> 02:15:20,040
fights it becomes like two kids in a 
fucking school yard.

2948
02:15:20,280 --> 02:15:22,590
It becomes a,
a brawl on the ground.

2949
02:15:22,840 --> 02:15:26,130
These wind up clawing at each other and 
they can't do anything.

2950
02:15:26,131 --> 02:15:28,450
There's no Kung Fu.
There's no monkey paw.

2951
02:15:28,451 --> 02:15:29,284
There's no attack the ribs with your 
knife point fingers and all this stupid 

2952
02:15:32,851 --> 02:15:34,830
shit.
But you watch these guys do it.

2953
02:15:34,831 --> 02:15:37,920
And me as a person who studied martial 
arts my whole life.

2954
02:15:38,160 --> 02:15:38,993
I know I don't practice Kung Fu,
but I know what is actually Kung Fu and 

2955
02:15:43,621 --> 02:15:45,420
what is some shit that someone's making 
up.

2956
02:15:45,720 --> 02:15:47,670
They're just practicing and making 
things up.

2957
02:15:47,790 --> 02:15:50,520
Well,
they could go to even a common food dojo

2958
02:15:50,760 --> 02:15:55,020
and try and pretend that that stuff's 
real and the Kung Fu guy would go like,

2959
02:15:55,021 --> 02:15:56,270
what are you talking about?
Like this?

2960
02:15:56,550 --> 02:15:57,383
You're inventing things.
Don't you feel bad for those guys at 

2961
02:15:59,851 --> 02:16:00,511
some level?
Yes,

2962
02:16:00,511 --> 02:16:01,800
I do.
I do.

2963
02:16:02,010 --> 02:16:05,970
I think that a lot of those guys,
if they had just found the correct path,

2964
02:16:06,420 --> 02:16:10,590
would benefit greatly if they just found
a real martial arts school.

2965
02:16:10,920 --> 02:16:13,350
Okay.
So here's what I think part of it is,

2966
02:16:13,710 --> 02:16:14,543
I think that they engage,
and I'm really interested to hear what 

2967
02:16:17,491 --> 02:16:18,324
you think about this.
I think that they engage in a 

2968
02:16:19,951 --> 02:16:22,260
willingness to self deceive.
Oh,

2969
02:16:22,261 --> 02:16:24,210
a hundred percent yeah,
100% yeah.

2970
02:16:24,450 --> 02:16:25,800
And they,
it's mutual.

2971
02:16:26,040 --> 02:16:27,960
It's with both people.
Like they,

2972
02:16:28,260 --> 02:16:29,093
they,
you know,

2973
02:16:29,110 --> 02:16:31,480
reinforce each other.
You see it in religion too though.

2974
02:16:31,750 --> 02:16:34,210
You see that in religion?
God finds a way.

2975
02:16:34,211 --> 02:16:36,300
Yes he does.
God does find a way.

2976
02:16:36,370 --> 02:16:40,150
Meanwhile they leave and smoke crack and
suck some dude's Dick people are crazy.

2977
02:16:40,180 --> 02:16:41,020
I mean,
that's what they do.

2978
02:16:41,021 --> 02:16:44,020
They pretend,
they pretend and they loved.

2979
02:16:44,050 --> 02:16:44,883
One of the things that people love about
Christians and Christians love about 

2980
02:16:48,041 --> 02:16:49,180
Christians and he's like,
well,

2981
02:16:49,181 --> 02:16:50,290
I'm a Christian.
I'm a Christian too,

2982
02:16:50,320 --> 02:16:52,660
right?
They you're saying no.

2983
02:16:52,690 --> 02:16:53,620
Yes.
Tribalism.

2984
02:16:53,621 --> 02:16:56,410
And also,
I know that at least in the moment,

2985
02:16:56,560 --> 02:16:59,890
you are going to engage in some very 
predictable behavior.

2986
02:17:00,220 --> 02:17:01,340
You're going to engage in,
uh,

2987
02:17:01,380 --> 02:17:02,213
you're,
you're a god feeling fear and Christian 

2988
02:17:03,191 --> 02:17:04,024
man.
So you're going to behave like a god 

2989
02:17:05,291 --> 02:17:06,124
fearing Christian man,
and you're going to say things 

2990
02:17:07,530 --> 02:17:09,640
[inaudible] I know where you're coming 
from.

2991
02:17:09,820 --> 02:17:10,653
You're not some fucking Weirdo Buddhist 
Zen dude who likes to do payoti now 

2992
02:17:14,801 --> 02:17:15,250
you're,
you're,

2993
02:17:15,250 --> 02:17:17,260
you're real clear.
You know what I mean?

2994
02:17:17,261 --> 02:17:18,310
I mean,
so it's real clear.

2995
02:17:18,311 --> 02:17:20,830
You like country music.
Are you Luke Bryan Fan Bait to,

2996
02:17:20,831 --> 02:17:21,664
well,
of course you've got a pickup truck off 

2997
02:17:22,541 --> 02:17:23,560
course and I've got,
oh,

2998
02:17:23,610 --> 02:17:25,060
I've got a belt buckle.
I've got a big belt buckle.

2999
02:17:25,061 --> 02:17:27,610
Do you know what about your boots?
Look at my boots or cowboy boots.

3000
02:17:27,760 --> 02:17:28,530
You know,
it's like we,

3001
02:17:28,530 --> 02:17:29,363
we engage in these really predictable 
patterns and people find comfort in 

3002
02:17:32,801 --> 02:17:34,000
those patterns.
Yeah.

3003
02:17:34,001 --> 02:17:36,370
And we tend to like people who are like 
ourselves.

3004
02:17:36,400 --> 02:17:37,360
Yes,
yes.

3005
02:17:37,361 --> 02:17:39,350
It's very much a tribalism thing and 
it's,

3006
02:17:39,370 --> 02:17:40,870
it's also very much,
it's,

3007
02:17:40,940 --> 02:17:41,773
it reinforces your,
like if you have a lack of willingness 

3008
02:17:46,870 --> 02:17:47,703
or ability or whatever it is to question
the reality that you have been shown 

3009
02:17:52,121 --> 02:17:53,560
that you have subscribed to.

3010
02:17:53,560 --> 02:17:55,870
If you have,
if you're not willing to question it and

3011
02:17:55,871 --> 02:17:58,180
you find someone else who was also not 
willing to question it,

3012
02:17:58,181 --> 02:18:00,700
there's some comfort in that.
And if you reassure each other,

3013
02:18:00,820 --> 02:18:02,290
there's some comfortable,
that's absolutely right.

3014
02:18:02,291 --> 02:18:06,070
And that's why it's so important for 
people to be honest with themselves.

3015
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:11,620
And how do,
how do we promote those values of people

3016
02:18:11,680 --> 02:18:12,513
of self honesty this way?
I think that is exactly what 

3017
02:18:15,581 --> 02:18:17,410
conversations,
I think this is the way you do it.

3018
02:18:17,590 --> 02:18:18,423
And especially the conversation like 
this that will be heard by more than a 

3019
02:18:20,980 --> 02:18:21,813
million people.
Yeah.

3020
02:18:22,200 --> 02:18:23,380
And that's,
that's the way you do it.

3021
02:18:23,410 --> 02:18:25,240
And I mean,
I'm just saying those Willem doing broom

3022
02:18:25,270 --> 02:18:26,103
to fix in the world,
but I'm saying humans talking to each 

3023
02:18:28,301 --> 02:18:29,920
other through social media,
through,

3024
02:18:30,230 --> 02:18:32,350
I want various math,
I'll just throw this out now.

3025
02:18:32,351 --> 02:18:33,130
I wonder if,
you know,

3026
02:18:33,130 --> 02:18:33,761
everyone's like,
oh,

3027
02:18:33,761 --> 02:18:35,860
you know,
would come after postmodernism,

3028
02:18:35,861 --> 02:18:36,040
whatever.

3029
02:18:36,040 --> 02:18:37,810
I wonder if this comes after 
postmodernism.

3030
02:18:37,811 --> 02:18:38,644
I mean,
I wonder if these truth telling 

3031
02:18:39,731 --> 02:18:40,564
conversations come after postmodernism.
Why say I certainly think there's a 

3032
02:18:44,861 --> 02:18:45,694
great benefit to talking to people and 
having people be honest and even in an 

3033
02:18:49,690 --> 02:18:52,060
uncomfortable way where when you 
listened to it,

3034
02:18:52,061 --> 02:18:53,170
it makes you think,
oh,

3035
02:18:53,560 --> 02:18:56,920
there's lights that go on in my head 
when I hear someone say something,

3036
02:18:56,950 --> 02:19:00,790
maybe maybe they'll be vulnerable or 
maybe there'll be like introspective and

3037
02:19:00,791 --> 02:19:01,624
almost a painful way when I hear it,
there's lights that go on in my head 

3038
02:19:04,691 --> 02:19:05,291
while I go,
wow,

3039
02:19:05,291 --> 02:19:06,124
okay,
I'm getting some real shit from this 

3040
02:19:06,941 --> 02:19:07,774
person and I'll find in myself these 
moments that relate to what this guy is 

3041
02:19:12,491 --> 02:19:13,240
saying.
And I,

3042
02:19:13,240 --> 02:19:14,073
I,
I try to see themselves from this point 

3043
02:19:15,491 --> 02:19:18,820
of view as opposed to a newscaster.
When someone is,

3044
02:19:18,840 --> 02:19:21,160
uh,
today in Los Angeles,

3045
02:19:21,161 --> 02:19:21,994
we found out the hard way.
What happens when you don't obey the 

3046
02:19:25,631 --> 02:19:27,860
law?
There's no re

3047
02:19:27,980 --> 02:19:29,900
reality.
There's no,

3048
02:19:30,260 --> 02:19:32,330
there's,
there's no human in there.

3049
02:19:32,570 --> 02:19:37,130
This is a strip club dj coming up on the
main stage.

3050
02:19:37,160 --> 02:19:42,110
It's lexus $14 Comma cozzies order now.
You know what I mean?

3051
02:19:42,111 --> 02:19:44,990
It's like these are patterns that are 
not real,

3052
02:19:44,991 --> 02:19:49,991
that people subscribe to and adopt and 
then perpetrate and,

3053
02:19:50,121 --> 02:19:52,700
and they do it over and over again in 
the business world.

3054
02:19:52,701 --> 02:19:54,920
Hello Jim.
How's the family?

3055
02:19:54,921 --> 02:19:57,800
Is Everything good?
These patterns are like,

3056
02:19:57,830 --> 02:20:01,310
they protect you from having to be 
vulnerable and real.

3057
02:20:01,460 --> 02:20:02,293
They buy by adopting these predetermined
patterns of behavior that we all are 

3058
02:20:06,981 --> 02:20:10,160
comfortable with and we all know as a 
god fearing Christian man,

3059
02:20:10,280 --> 02:20:11,590
well,
I'm a god fearing Christian man,

3060
02:20:11,600 --> 02:20:12,380
myself,
swap.

3061
02:20:12,380 --> 02:20:13,970
I don't understand where you're coming 
from there sir.

3062
02:20:14,210 --> 02:20:17,420
Give me a handshake right now on the,
we're on the same page that what they're

3063
02:20:17,421 --> 02:20:18,430
doing is they,
they're,

3064
02:20:18,440 --> 02:20:19,273
they're,
they're removing the possibility of 

3065
02:20:22,310 --> 02:20:25,670
vulnerability and of,
of reality and authenticity.

3066
02:20:25,700 --> 02:20:26,533
Yes.
Authenticity is the perfect word and 

3067
02:20:27,441 --> 02:20:29,090
that,
that makes me sad for them.

3068
02:20:30,140 --> 02:20:30,871
It really does.
It's,

3069
02:20:30,871 --> 02:20:34,400
it's a type of tragedy when you get sad 
of the shit that I don't get sad.

3070
02:20:35,120 --> 02:20:36,890
I get sad at cartoons.
Well,

3071
02:20:37,520 --> 02:20:40,640
I don't get set of cartoons,
but I do feel the impetus to help people

3072
02:20:40,641 --> 02:20:41,474
like that.
Like I do feel that it's important that 

3073
02:20:43,340 --> 02:20:47,000
that people are laboring under beliefs 
about reality.

3074
02:20:47,030 --> 02:20:47,863
Like again,
fantasy based martial arts that just 

3075
02:20:49,101 --> 02:20:51,710
simply aren't true and they're wasting 
their time.

3076
02:20:51,800 --> 02:20:52,633
But unlike fantasy martial arts,
these people vote and these people 

3077
02:20:56,150 --> 02:20:59,240
affect decisions.
They directly affect my life.

3078
02:20:59,330 --> 02:21:00,680
Yes,
yes,

3079
02:21:01,010 --> 02:21:01,843
yes.
Especially social issues comes a real 

3080
02:21:03,561 --> 02:21:04,520
problem.
You know,

3081
02:21:04,580 --> 02:21:05,413
it becomes a real problem when you start
blocking people's access to certain 

3082
02:21:08,811 --> 02:21:12,860
medical procedures and deciding what can
and can be done based on,

3083
02:21:13,010 --> 02:21:13,843
I mean,
look at what was happening during the 

3084
02:21:14,571 --> 02:21:17,960
Bush administration when it comes to,
when it came to stem cell research,

3085
02:21:17,961 --> 02:21:18,470
right?

3086
02:21:18,470 --> 02:21:21,920
I mean it was fucking shackled and 
stopped because everybody,

3087
02:21:21,921 --> 02:21:22,754
they're gold sail bay bees and they go,
they're going to kill babies and just 

3088
02:21:25,941 --> 02:21:29,020
get the stem cells from embryos and 
said,

3089
02:21:29,030 --> 02:21:32,750
Satan mean stem cells from skin you 
fuck.

3090
02:21:32,751 --> 02:21:36,600
And meanwhile the rest of the world,
it has like advanced in progress.

3091
02:21:36,601 --> 02:21:38,270
Do you know the Indians and South 
Koreans?

3092
02:21:38,271 --> 02:21:39,104
Yeah.
I mean it's just we got fucked by 

3093
02:21:40,521 --> 02:21:43,130
religious ideology.
Got in the way of medical innovation.

3094
02:21:43,310 --> 02:21:45,050
Yeah,
it's Itchy I think.

3095
02:21:45,230 --> 02:21:48,680
I think part of this is,
I've been thinking about this a lot.

3096
02:21:48,710 --> 02:21:49,543
I think part of this,
a way that we can at least dent this 

3097
02:21:52,861 --> 02:21:56,540
problem is by promoting the value of 
honesty.

3098
02:21:57,260 --> 02:21:59,630
Because if we promote the value of 
honesty,

3099
02:21:59,990 --> 02:22:00,823
then with that comes the willingness to 
revise people's beliefs and we have to 

3100
02:22:04,341 --> 02:22:05,900
make it okay to say,
I don't know,

3101
02:22:06,360 --> 02:22:07,190
like I'm totally cool.

3102
02:22:07,190 --> 02:22:08,780
It's you sitting here and you talk about
all these guys.

3103
02:22:08,781 --> 02:22:09,614
I don't know all that stuff.
I think that's one of the beautiful 

3104
02:22:11,421 --> 02:22:12,254
things about this new age of information
is that is impossible now clearly to 

3105
02:22:18,081 --> 02:22:20,360
know everything.
No one can know everything,

3106
02:22:20,690 --> 02:22:21,523
so it's okay to say,
I don't know now where it used to be a 

3107
02:22:24,651 --> 02:22:28,940
sign of you are poorly motivated,
are poorly educated or what?

3108
02:22:29,100 --> 02:22:32,310
I mean I'm not very educated.
I went to college for three years.

3109
02:22:32,311 --> 02:22:35,580
I barely paid attention and I only did 
it because I didn't want people to think

3110
02:22:35,581 --> 02:22:38,040
I was a loser.
I barely made it out of high school,

3111
02:22:38,160 --> 02:22:41,610
but since that time I've read a lot of 
shit,

3112
02:22:41,611 --> 02:22:42,444
have watched a lot of documentaries,
I've had a lot of fascinating 

3113
02:22:44,131 --> 02:22:47,670
conversations with people and I've 
accumulated some information.

3114
02:22:47,730 --> 02:22:49,830
So am I educated?
Not really,

3115
02:22:49,831 --> 02:22:52,440
but yeah,
I mean I'm an educated on certain things

3116
02:22:52,441 --> 02:22:53,070
about light.

3117
02:22:53,070 --> 02:22:55,920
I would say maybe not formally educated.
What does that,

3118
02:22:55,921 --> 02:22:57,000
you know,
where,

3119
02:22:57,030 --> 02:23:01,110
where is formality now when you have 
formal education?

3120
02:23:01,111 --> 02:23:02,910
Like what's going on with your school?
Wait,

3121
02:23:02,911 --> 02:23:04,560
question.
Not La sit now.

3122
02:23:04,561 --> 02:23:05,820
All schools,
all schools.

3123
02:23:05,940 --> 02:23:08,340
What is it now?
Because that's not education.

3124
02:23:08,550 --> 02:23:09,031
You're,
you're,

3125
02:23:09,031 --> 02:23:13,440
you're being indoctrinated into this 
ridiculous ideology.

3126
02:23:13,650 --> 02:23:15,390
If you're participating in that kind of 
shit,

3127
02:23:15,420 --> 02:23:18,030
it's worse than it's anti education.
It's like Kata.

3128
02:23:18,230 --> 02:23:20,130
Yeah.
It's in a lot of ways.

3129
02:23:20,380 --> 02:23:21,990
In a lot of ways.
It is.

3130
02:23:21,991 --> 02:23:24,860
Um,
it is just like religion and,

3131
02:23:24,861 --> 02:23:25,694
and that's what my friend Kurt Metzger 
was saying about the social justice 

3132
02:23:28,441 --> 02:23:29,490
warriors.
He's like,

3133
02:23:29,491 --> 02:23:30,121
no,
no,

3134
02:23:30,121 --> 02:23:31,290
I,
I've seen this.

3135
02:23:31,320 --> 02:23:34,680
I grew up in a fucking call.
I know what this is.

3136
02:23:34,770 --> 02:23:36,780
You're telling me I can't think about it
any other way.

3137
02:23:36,781 --> 02:23:39,720
And that's bullshit.
And his reaction to it is very bright.

3138
02:23:39,750 --> 02:23:42,720
He gets angry at it and you know,
and he's not like a violent guy,

3139
02:23:42,721 --> 02:23:43,840
but he's just like,
it was like,

3140
02:23:44,010 --> 02:23:45,060
this is fucking bullshit.

3141
02:23:45,060 --> 02:23:46,280
I know what it is,
is bullshit.

3142
02:23:46,290 --> 02:23:47,760
You're,
you're making me think a certain way.

3143
02:23:47,940 --> 02:23:48,780
I'm not doing it.
Yeah.

3144
02:23:48,781 --> 02:23:51,270
And in the bigger picture of things,
you know,

3145
02:23:51,271 --> 02:23:52,104
America has been,
this is a somewhat of a controversial 

3146
02:23:54,181 --> 02:23:54,630
statement,
but,

3147
02:23:54,630 --> 02:23:55,463
but we're,
we're not the great superpower we used 

3148
02:23:56,911 --> 02:23:57,744
to be,
but the one thing that we make for 

3149
02:23:59,230 --> 02:24:00,063
yourself,
the one thing we've always had is we've 

3150
02:24:03,061 --> 02:24:03,894
had strong institutions and strong 
universities and now we're seeing those 

3151
02:24:07,890 --> 02:24:08,723
being undermined,
at least in the humanities in general 

3152
02:24:10,441 --> 02:24:12,990
and even to a certain extent in the 
sciences and it,

3153
02:24:13,080 --> 02:24:14,220
it,
I don't assign it.

3154
02:24:15,300 --> 02:24:16,500
See,
I guess what I said,

3155
02:24:16,501 --> 02:24:17,430
I think,
cause I don't,

3156
02:24:17,520 --> 02:24:21,300
I don't really know because I'm not in 
the sciences so I can't speak to that.

3157
02:24:21,750 --> 02:24:24,030
But just anecdotally from what I've 
heard of people,

3158
02:24:24,031 --> 02:24:24,331
but again,
can't,

3159
02:24:24,331 --> 02:24:25,530
I can't,
I can't speak to that.

3160
02:24:25,830 --> 02:24:26,970
You know,
I was thinking about,

3161
02:24:27,060 --> 02:24:31,110
but anecdotally can come up with 
specific examples because that's where I

3162
02:24:31,111 --> 02:24:31,944
haven't heard it interfered with except 
for the idea of promoting more women in 

3163
02:24:36,961 --> 02:24:38,820
science and there's some how or another,
some sex.

3164
02:24:38,821 --> 02:24:40,500
That's what I was in science.
What I was thinking.

3165
02:24:40,501 --> 02:24:42,570
So,
so here's the problem with that.

3166
02:24:42,990 --> 02:24:43,823
Why are there no diversity requirements 
with sports teams that will write like 

3167
02:24:48,931 --> 02:24:49,764
football teams,
how come they don't need to have a 

3168
02:24:50,701 --> 02:24:52,380
certain amount of women because they 
want to win,

3169
02:24:53,100 --> 02:24:55,080
but also they don't want women to get 
killed,

3170
02:24:55,680 --> 02:24:56,513
right?
So that's different because it's 

3171
02:24:57,541 --> 02:24:58,770
physical.
Okay,

3172
02:24:58,830 --> 02:25:00,240
well why?
Why aren't they say,

3173
02:25:00,241 --> 02:25:03,330
well we need so many Puerto Ricans here 
or we need so many,

3174
02:25:03,540 --> 02:25:07,650
there aren't diversity requirements.
So here's a word flight exogenous.

3175
02:25:07,651 --> 02:25:08,640
It's like an X.
I know that word.

3176
02:25:08,860 --> 02:25:09,241
Okay,
cool.

3177
02:25:09,241 --> 02:25:14,241
Cool.
So because because they want to win.

3178
02:25:14,251 --> 02:25:16,470
In other words,
they're telling you this is important to

3179
02:25:16,471 --> 02:25:17,304
us.
Anytime you impose a value on a system 

3180
02:25:19,920 --> 02:25:24,190
that is,
that is winning is the value

3181
02:25:24,250 --> 02:25:26,170
and that's an marketplace,
right?

3182
02:25:26,171 --> 02:25:27,640
Right.
That's a con competition.

3183
02:25:27,641 --> 02:25:29,560
That's a free market.
Anytime you say,

3184
02:25:29,561 --> 02:25:32,770
well,
you know you also need diversity,

3185
02:25:32,800 --> 02:25:37,800
then you're making it more difficult to,
to win a meritocracy is like that.

3186
02:25:38,111 --> 02:25:42,370
Like you,
you want people in a system to have in,

3187
02:25:42,371 --> 02:25:43,720
in academia,
I can tell you what those are.

3188
02:25:43,721 --> 02:25:44,554
You need to be well published.
You had works need to be cited by 

3189
02:25:46,181 --> 02:25:47,570
others.
You need to have the,

3190
02:25:47,610 --> 02:25:48,760
we have all these metrics,
they're,

3191
02:25:48,761 --> 02:25:49,594
they're pretty straightforward and you 
either live up to the metrics or you 

3192
02:25:51,611 --> 02:25:52,444
don't.
But now this is why I was talking about 

3193
02:25:55,661 --> 02:25:56,494
the sciences.
When you tried to put people in 

3194
02:25:58,181 --> 02:26:01,720
positions who are not qualified for 
those positions,

3195
02:26:01,780 --> 02:26:05,920
you undermine the meritocracy.
So when you're trying to put people,

3196
02:26:06,010 --> 02:26:07,780
if you say,
well there's not enough women here,

3197
02:26:07,990 --> 02:26:09,070
we need to find more women.

3198
02:26:09,190 --> 02:26:11,220
There are not enough African American.
Well enough.

3199
02:26:11,230 --> 02:26:12,430
That's a trickier.
But there,

3200
02:26:12,480 --> 02:26:15,070
there are very few African Americans who
study philosophy.

3201
02:26:15,610 --> 02:26:18,010
If you are an African American with a 
phd in philosophy,

3202
02:26:18,040 --> 02:26:21,310
may you are your gold.
That is awesome.

3203
02:26:21,640 --> 02:26:22,473
So an African American with a phd for 
philosophy can kind of write their own 

3204
02:26:25,541 --> 02:26:26,374
ticket.
Yeah.

3205
02:26:27,640 --> 02:26:30,480
Yeah.
[inaudible] a good thing cause they want

3206
02:26:30,481 --> 02:26:31,314
to promote more African Americans get 
involved in philosophy and then perhaps 

3207
02:26:34,811 --> 02:26:38,780
that will sort of engage more people 
doing that.

3208
02:26:38,840 --> 02:26:39,673
Now this is now,
this is a really interesting 

3209
02:26:41,051 --> 02:26:41,884
conversation that we should have.
This is the kind of thing at this point 

3210
02:26:45,970 --> 02:26:46,803
in academia,
we have to shut down the discourse 

3211
02:26:48,251 --> 02:26:51,550
because someone's going to be offended,
but I think that's an important question

3212
02:26:51,730 --> 02:26:55,930
because your question is basically it's 
a kind of utilitarian calculus like,

3213
02:26:56,020 --> 02:26:56,590
okay,
yeah.

3214
02:26:56,590 --> 02:26:59,560
Let's say that we have,
what is the,

3215
02:26:59,561 --> 02:27:01,030
first of all,
you have to look at the evidence.

3216
02:27:01,030 --> 02:27:02,560
Regressives don't like evidence very 
much,

3217
02:27:02,561 --> 02:27:06,100
but we have to look at the evidence.
What is the evidence?

3218
02:27:06,280 --> 02:27:09,040
If there are more African Americans in 
philosophy,

3219
02:27:09,280 --> 02:27:11,170
can they mentor more African American 
students,

3220
02:27:11,171 --> 02:27:12,490
et Cetera.
Of course.

3221
02:27:12,550 --> 02:27:15,280
I would think that we would want that.
That would be a good thing.

3222
02:27:15,310 --> 02:27:19,330
That would be something that would be 
wonderful.

3223
02:27:19,630 --> 02:27:20,463
The question is,
does that mean that we would hire a 

3224
02:27:23,141 --> 02:27:28,141
candidate who does not,
who would not be hired if that candidate

3225
02:27:29,891 --> 02:27:31,180
had a different skin color?
Right?

3226
02:27:31,320 --> 02:27:34,360
Like that whole thing undermines the 
meritocracy,

3227
02:27:34,600 --> 02:27:35,433
but the moment that you start talking 
about putting a diversity requirement 

3228
02:27:38,680 --> 02:27:39,610
on,
for example,

3229
02:27:39,611 --> 02:27:41,770
my discipline philosophy,
in essence,

3230
02:27:41,771 --> 02:27:44,260
I think what you're saying is it's not 
important.

3231
02:27:44,410 --> 02:27:48,910
Your discipline isn't important because 
we don't do that when the outcome really

3232
02:27:48,911 --> 02:27:51,610
matters.
We don't do that with brain surgery.

3233
02:27:51,760 --> 02:27:53,290
We don't do that with sports teams.

3234
02:27:53,650 --> 02:27:57,160
So we're not looking for the best 
candidates.

3235
02:27:57,430 --> 02:27:58,263
What we're looking for is to bring 
people into these disciplines that may 

3236
02:28:03,761 --> 02:28:08,761
not have had the opportunity and that 
might be bad for the overall discipline.

3237
02:28:10,030 --> 02:28:12,460
Yeah,
it's bad for the overall institution.

3238
02:28:12,461 --> 02:28:13,294
It's bad for the discipline,
but because you're not finding the best 

3239
02:28:15,401 --> 02:28:16,234
people,
but the idea is that you're trying to 

3240
02:28:17,081 --> 02:28:20,860
promote these disciplines in places 
where people aren't,

3241
02:28:21,110 --> 02:28:21,943
as it were not represented,
but also they don't have the same 

3242
02:28:26,331 --> 02:28:28,820
advantages.
They don't have privileges there,

3243
02:28:28,821 --> 02:28:30,700
don't have good as privileged as another
word we talked about.

3244
02:28:30,720 --> 02:28:32,030
So,
so they're underrepresented.

3245
02:28:32,031 --> 02:28:32,864
So we want more people to discipline in 
as long as that's not bad in and of 

3246
02:28:37,971 --> 02:28:40,820
itself,
but we need to have a conversation about

3247
02:28:40,821 --> 02:28:41,690
what that means.
See,

3248
02:28:41,691 --> 02:28:42,524
part of the problem with regressives is 
they look at outcomes instead of 

3249
02:28:46,251 --> 02:28:47,084
opportunities.
We need to construct systems to give 

3250
02:28:49,731 --> 02:28:51,890
everybody,
regardless of their skin color,

3251
02:28:51,891 --> 02:28:56,030
of their ethnicity and equal opportunity
and an education or the first rate.

3252
02:28:56,360 --> 02:29:01,280
And what we're seeing instead is systems
being created to orchestrate or engineer

3253
02:29:01,281 --> 02:29:05,600
outcomes produce this many black African
about whatever it is,

3254
02:29:05,601 --> 02:29:06,860
or Hispanic,
whatever it is.

3255
02:29:07,310 --> 02:29:09,350
The,
first of all,

3256
02:29:09,351 --> 02:29:12,110
it's a bad way to think about it.
It's a horrible way to think about it.

3257
02:29:12,560 --> 02:29:17,560
But the other problem is in meritocracy 
matters we need,

3258
02:29:18,440 --> 02:29:22,220
we need to,
if anything should be institutionalized.

3259
02:29:22,520 --> 02:29:27,520
It should be systems that are raced,
blind systems that don't look,

3260
02:29:28,551 --> 02:29:30,350
think about it.
You could also think about like this,

3261
02:29:30,740 --> 02:29:32,660
think about the black guy who is in 
philosophy,

3262
02:29:32,690 --> 02:29:35,750
who's incredibly smart and qualified.
I have a student of mine,

3263
02:29:35,751 --> 02:29:38,120
Matt Hernandez,
that kid is freaking genius,

3264
02:29:38,240 --> 02:29:42,920
like truly one in a million,
like much smarter than I am.

3265
02:29:43,280 --> 02:29:44,870
He's published off.
I mean he,

3266
02:29:44,871 --> 02:29:47,120
the kid's awesome.
He's Hispanic.

3267
02:29:47,210 --> 02:29:49,640
He's going to get his phd in philosophy,
got a full ride,

3268
02:29:49,641 --> 02:29:50,474
a full scholarship.

3269
02:29:51,860 --> 02:29:55,970
The crime.
The shame is that when Matt gets in,

3270
02:29:56,030 --> 02:29:56,841
people would say,
well,

3271
02:29:56,841 --> 02:29:58,940
he just got it because he's Hispanic.
No,

3272
02:29:59,000 --> 02:29:59,833
actually,
no,

3273
02:29:59,840 --> 02:30:01,580
he got is going to say that though.
Well,

3274
02:30:01,581 --> 02:30:03,770
no one's going to say it.
They're gonna think it.

3275
02:30:04,460 --> 02:30:05,540
Well,
that's the problem.

3276
02:30:05,541 --> 02:30:06,374
The problem is that we can't have a 
conversation to ask people if they're 

3277
02:30:08,481 --> 02:30:10,040
thinking about it,
because if they say yes,

3278
02:30:10,041 --> 02:30:11,510
there'll be smeared as a racist.
Okay.

3279
02:30:11,511 --> 02:30:12,344
So then how do you address the issue 
with inequality inside of these 

3280
02:30:18,261 --> 02:30:20,660
marginalized community?
That's a great question.

3281
02:30:22,520 --> 02:30:23,353
Look,
this is what I think we need to do when 

3282
02:30:24,651 --> 02:30:25,484
you look at surveys of if people,
so I think that these lines are 

3283
02:30:30,711 --> 02:30:33,260
primarily a po on class drawn upon 
class,

3284
02:30:33,261 --> 02:30:35,990
which is something else no one wants to 
talk about instead of race.

3285
02:30:36,020 --> 02:30:39,020
It just so happens that,
uh,

3286
02:30:39,170 --> 02:30:42,140
fewer African Americans frame it the 
other way.

3287
02:30:42,140 --> 02:30:44,840
More African Americans have bond born 
into poverty then,

3288
02:30:44,930 --> 02:30:46,280
then white folks.
That's just the,

3289
02:30:46,400 --> 02:30:47,233
that's just a fact.
We can also talk about something that's 

3290
02:30:50,091 --> 02:30:53,840
really an interesting about criminigenic
factors or risk predictors.

3291
02:30:53,841 --> 02:30:54,674
They're not what you think for people 
who would be violent criminals did just 

3292
02:30:56,601 --> 02:30:58,610
not what you think at all.
Uh,

3293
02:30:58,611 --> 02:31:00,320
but people try to make that a ratio 
issue.

3294
02:31:00,500 --> 02:31:05,500
But when you look at these systems,
when you look at these school systems,

3295
02:31:06,080 --> 02:31:09,050
for example,
um,

3296
02:31:09,110 --> 02:31:09,943
I just totally lost my train of thought.
I started thinking about race and Jimi 

3297
02:31:12,470 --> 02:31:13,460
Hendrix's photo back there.
Oh,

3298
02:31:13,461 --> 02:31:15,440
sorry.
What you were talking about,

3299
02:31:15,490 --> 02:31:18,230
um,
trying to get more,

3300
02:31:18,270 --> 02:31:19,103
oh yeah.
Addressing the issue of income 

3301
02:31:20,310 --> 02:31:21,540
inequality.
And so,

3302
02:31:21,660 --> 02:31:23,760
so what we need to do is,
well,

3303
02:31:23,850 --> 02:31:27,090
we need to start thinking about 
opportunities.

3304
02:31:27,390 --> 02:31:29,540
Well,
the other thing is we need to think long

3305
02:31:29,541 --> 02:31:31,140
term and not short term.

3306
02:31:31,350 --> 02:31:33,870
We need to look at the problem and be 
honest.

3307
02:31:33,900 --> 02:31:34,733
And there are some structural issues 
with our electorate and the way that 

3308
02:31:37,951 --> 02:31:38,784
we've established politics in this 
country of offices of four years and 

3309
02:31:41,491 --> 02:31:42,324
then eight years in numerable.
We need to have a longer term vision in 

3310
02:31:45,631 --> 02:31:47,860
a look at what this wants to be.
Ah,

3311
02:31:48,260 --> 02:31:49,093
Eh,
right now we face a problem and that 

3312
02:31:52,501 --> 02:31:55,890
we're not adequately educating poor 
people in our country.

3313
02:31:55,891 --> 02:31:57,870
And the majority of those happened to be
black,

3314
02:31:58,230 --> 02:32:02,790
and this is an enormous problem.
This is going to come back to haunt us.

3315
02:32:03,900 --> 02:32:08,040
But the solution to that problem is not 
diversity initiatives.

3316
02:32:08,430 --> 02:32:11,310
That's the,
here's the other reason why that's bad.

3317
02:32:11,700 --> 02:32:13,890
It's not even a bandaid.
It's worse.

3318
02:32:14,160 --> 02:32:15,840
It's because people then say,
well,

3319
02:32:15,841 --> 02:32:17,070
look,
this floss department,

3320
02:32:17,071 --> 02:32:19,560
this department has so many minorities,
things must be going well,

3321
02:32:19,620 --> 02:32:21,090
actually no,
they're not going well.

3322
02:32:21,150 --> 02:32:21,983
It was an artificial solution that was 
put in and the underlying structural 

3323
02:32:25,441 --> 02:32:28,230
inequality and economic disparity hasn't
been addressed.

3324
02:32:28,260 --> 02:32:29,093
That's a great way to put it.
And what about all the poor people that 

3325
02:32:32,011 --> 02:32:32,844
live in West Virginia or Kentucky?
There's families have been generations 

3326
02:32:35,551 --> 02:32:36,384
and generations of coal miners.
I mean just because other white people 

3327
02:32:39,780 --> 02:32:43,980
have made it into universities and made 
an into certain institutions.

3328
02:32:43,981 --> 02:32:48,030
You're being racist if you think that 
those people shouldn't get an equal shot

3329
02:32:48,031 --> 02:32:50,610
of things as well.
And so the way we fix it is,

3330
02:32:50,611 --> 02:32:51,990
again,
this is John rawls idea,

3331
02:32:52,020 --> 02:32:54,240
public education in the first rate.
However,

3332
02:32:54,390 --> 02:32:57,210
every time I would say that people would
say two things.

3333
02:32:57,211 --> 02:32:58,044
They'd play identity politics.
You're just what you're saying that 

3334
02:33:00,211 --> 02:33:01,680
because you're white,
that gives them,

3335
02:33:01,830 --> 02:33:03,990
that's their ticket to discredit what 
I'm saying.

3336
02:33:04,260 --> 02:33:06,720
That's the,
that's why people,

3337
02:33:07,020 --> 02:33:09,990
they use that as an excuse to not listen
to your arguments.

3338
02:33:10,110 --> 02:33:11,730
It's really,
it's perverted.

3339
02:33:12,210 --> 02:33:12,960
I mean it's,
it's,

3340
02:33:12,960 --> 02:33:16,010
it's really despicable.
So,

3341
02:33:16,020 --> 02:33:17,100
so,
so the,

3342
02:33:17,170 --> 02:33:19,800
so they use that.
They use that idea as an excuse.

3343
02:33:20,070 --> 02:33:23,460
So you've just said that.
But the other thing that it does,

3344
02:33:24,330 --> 02:33:29,330
I mean if you really start to think 
about what kind of society do we want to

3345
02:33:29,761 --> 02:33:30,511
move to,
what,

3346
02:33:30,511 --> 02:33:33,300
what are the limits of our institutions?
What,

3347
02:33:33,540 --> 02:33:36,540
what role should the meritocracy play?
Should you disrupt that?

3348
02:33:36,541 --> 02:33:39,120
If there are racial inequalities or 
imbalances,

3349
02:33:39,570 --> 02:33:40,403
these are questions we have to address.
People had democracy have to address 

3350
02:33:44,671 --> 02:33:45,504
this and you cannot have fear of talking
about this because someone's going to 

3351
02:33:48,991 --> 02:33:51,150
call you a racist.
You just can't.

3352
02:33:51,270 --> 02:33:53,400
So if you want to put a proposal forward
that says,

3353
02:33:53,401 --> 02:33:54,510
or an idea,
well,

3354
02:33:54,511 --> 02:33:55,590
I don't think,
you know,

3355
02:33:55,710 --> 02:33:58,500
hiring should be this way.
You need to have that conversation.

3356
02:33:58,650 --> 02:33:59,850
But there's one other issue.

3357
02:33:59,910 --> 02:34:00,743
There's one of the tactic that the 
regressive left use and that's the idea 

3358
02:34:03,871 --> 02:34:06,420
of privilege.
They love that word privilege.

3359
02:34:06,750 --> 02:34:09,060
Oh well you know,
you don't even see your privilege.

3360
02:34:09,061 --> 02:34:12,540
You don't privileges yet.
Another thing that's used and look,

3361
02:34:12,780 --> 02:34:16,800
I,
I think the impetus for that is good.

3362
02:34:16,930 --> 02:34:21,520
The danger here is that because these 
people are so nasty,

3363
02:34:21,610 --> 02:34:22,443
so mean spirited and so generally insane
that we discard everything that they're 

3364
02:34:26,891 --> 02:34:27,724
saying.
We throw the baby out with the bath 

3365
02:34:28,761 --> 02:34:32,500
water and now we need to be conscious 
and careful that we don't do that.

3366
02:34:32,800 --> 02:34:36,820
We need to acknowledge that they're 
saying some important things there.

3367
02:34:37,180 --> 02:34:38,013
You know,
racial treatment of people in the basis 

3368
02:34:40,601 --> 02:34:41,590
of race,
gender,

3369
02:34:41,591 --> 02:34:42,424
sexual orientation,
not discriminating against someone 

3370
02:34:44,171 --> 02:34:45,004
because they,
they don't feel comfortable in a male 

3371
02:34:46,331 --> 02:34:47,164
body or a female or Guy Mark Fisher I 
roll with just is a gay and has his 

3372
02:34:51,090 --> 02:34:51,500
gauges.

3373
02:34:51,500 --> 02:34:54,190
Just think these things are important.
These things matter.

3374
02:34:54,340 --> 02:34:58,150
These things are things that we have to 
talk about and if I have privilege,

3375
02:34:58,300 --> 02:34:59,133
I want to be conscious of that in.
If I'm treating someone in a way that's 

3376
02:35:02,500 --> 02:35:04,600
unjust or if it's unkind,
I,

3377
02:35:04,690 --> 02:35:06,400
I,
I want to know about that.

3378
02:35:06,401 --> 02:35:08,530
That's not the guy I want to be,
you know,

3379
02:35:08,620 --> 02:35:12,280
so,
so how do we talk about these things?

3380
02:35:12,370 --> 02:35:14,890
How do we,
how do we engage these?

3381
02:35:14,891 --> 02:35:16,630
Well,
here's how you don't talk about them.

3382
02:35:17,110 --> 02:35:20,830
You don't talk about them by constantly 
smearing people with privilege.

3383
02:35:20,960 --> 02:35:23,130
You saying you have privilege,
you're not,

3384
02:35:23,260 --> 02:35:27,190
or Portland state my university,
they had an event where students,

3385
02:35:27,220 --> 02:35:29,170
minority students were,
were,

3386
02:35:29,320 --> 02:35:31,030
you know,
could speak about all these things,

3387
02:35:31,240 --> 02:35:33,610
but students who were,
I can't remember the exact phrasing,

3388
02:35:33,611 --> 02:35:35,920
not of color,
were invited to listen.

3389
02:35:37,710 --> 02:35:40,260
Think about that.
They were invited to listen.

3390
02:35:41,190 --> 02:35:45,900
They have institutionalized racism.
That's what that is.

3391
02:35:48,270 --> 02:35:51,720
It is.
It certainly racism in that sense.

3392
02:35:51,721 --> 02:35:52,554
But isn't it an opportunity for people 
that have been marginalized to express 

3393
02:35:55,711 --> 02:35:56,544
themselves in a platform that maybe a 
lot of people that have been 

3394
02:35:59,281 --> 02:36:00,810
marginalized haven't had the 
opportunity?

3395
02:36:02,220 --> 02:36:07,220
Isn't there room for people of a 
specific race to speak,

3396
02:36:07,590 --> 02:36:08,423
uh,
about some issues that maybe they would 

3397
02:36:10,020 --> 02:36:14,070
understand intimately that you are,
I wouldn't because we're white folks.

3398
02:36:14,071 --> 02:36:16,020
There's no question at all that that's 
true.

3399
02:36:16,320 --> 02:36:18,060
And you know what I was at at bad 
though,

3400
02:36:18,061 --> 02:36:20,300
to have someone have the opportunity to 
like,

3401
02:36:20,370 --> 02:36:21,203
let's,
let's allow African Americans speak and 

3402
02:36:23,401 --> 02:36:25,950
let's allow these white folks to listen 
to what they have to say.

3403
02:36:26,220 --> 02:36:27,053
And then maybe you have another 
conference or maybe a debate or maybe a 

3404
02:36:31,051 --> 02:36:34,650
conversation where you allow someone to 
have a retort.

3405
02:36:34,710 --> 02:36:35,543
So the first,
the first problem with that is if you 

3406
02:36:37,411 --> 02:36:39,930
frame it in terms of an opportunity than
if I say yes,

3407
02:36:39,931 --> 02:36:40,764
it's bad,
then it should be like I'm denying 

3408
02:36:41,851 --> 02:36:42,684
people the opportunity.
So I think that's the best way to frame 

3409
02:36:44,311 --> 02:36:45,144
it.
Right.

3410
02:36:46,200 --> 02:36:48,430
Uh,
the problem with that one price,

3411
02:36:48,460 --> 02:36:50,710
my buddy who's an appellate court judge,
and he said one,

3412
02:36:50,830 --> 02:36:53,680
he said he thinks it's unwise or his son
actually said this,

3413
02:36:53,681 --> 02:36:54,640
he didn't say this.
His son is,

3414
02:36:54,641 --> 02:36:55,181
uh,
is a,

3415
02:36:55,181 --> 02:36:55,870
uh,
uh,

3416
02:36:55,870 --> 02:36:59,740
uh,
on the clerks for some supreme court.

3417
02:37:00,040 --> 02:37:02,380
I don't even know what he's put some,
but he has his lawyer,

3418
02:37:02,381 --> 02:37:03,330
board certified,
et Cetera,

3419
02:37:03,520 --> 02:37:04,810
have a pass the bar.
Excuse me.

3420
02:37:05,480 --> 02:37:06,313
Uh,
part of the problem is that if you do 

3421
02:37:07,301 --> 02:37:09,880
that,
so I was amazed that that was legal.

3422
02:37:09,940 --> 02:37:11,800
I'm not a lawyer,
I don't pretend to be a lawyer,

3423
02:37:11,801 --> 02:37:12,634
but he said it's actually legal.
The problem is that you then need to 

3424
02:37:14,681 --> 02:37:18,560
hold than white people or whoever any 
other group can hold and say,

3425
02:37:18,561 --> 02:37:20,630
look,
blacks can't speak basically.

3426
02:37:20,660 --> 02:37:22,820
So we can get in and we can talk about 
how great it is.

3427
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:24,890
Good luck with that.
So you're right.

3428
02:37:24,950 --> 02:37:27,190
So you're so it's not so you,
you,

3429
02:37:27,220 --> 02:37:28,053
you're creating an opportunity for 
people who are genuine racists to 

3430
02:37:31,221 --> 02:37:33,800
undermine the whole system.
But the other thing is like,

3431
02:37:34,340 --> 02:37:37,490
I think it's important you can totally 
do that and say,

3432
02:37:37,491 --> 02:37:40,130
look,
we're going to have people for two hours

3433
02:37:40,131 --> 02:37:41,870
speak about their experiences of 
oppression.

3434
02:37:41,930 --> 02:37:44,480
I think that's great.
And I think that they should do that.

3435
02:37:44,630 --> 02:37:45,463
And I think we need to be more sensitive
and I think we need to correct any 

3436
02:37:48,411 --> 02:37:51,920
structural inequalities or remove biases
that we have with people.

3437
02:37:51,921 --> 02:37:53,300
And I'm sure I still have some,
I don't,

3438
02:37:53,420 --> 02:37:55,040
I don't know of any,
I try to remove them.

3439
02:37:55,190 --> 02:37:56,180
I'm sure.
I still have them.

3440
02:37:56,450 --> 02:37:57,283
But the idea is that shouldn't people of
any race then be allowed to ask people 

3441
02:38:01,341 --> 02:38:03,980
questions about those experiences?
Shouldn't we then say,

3442
02:38:03,981 --> 02:38:05,720
Oh,
you've had this experiences of,

3443
02:38:05,900 --> 02:38:07,070
you know,
gang Jujitsu again,

3444
02:38:07,071 --> 02:38:09,470
whatever it is,
or being black in the academy are being,

3445
02:38:09,471 --> 02:38:11,330
uh,
like you said this,

3446
02:38:11,331 --> 02:38:13,070
like,
I don't know how to explain that to me.

3447
02:38:13,100 --> 02:38:13,933
Explain that to all know.
So you shutting down possibilities for 

3448
02:38:16,911 --> 02:38:21,500
people who don't understand those.
That's the way we understand things.

3449
02:38:21,560 --> 02:38:24,350
We come to understand through asking 
questions like,

3450
02:38:24,440 --> 02:38:24,801
you know,
Oh,

3451
02:38:24,801 --> 02:38:27,200
well why do you do the rear naked choke 
list?

3452
02:38:27,201 --> 02:38:27,681
Why?
Oh,

3453
02:38:27,681 --> 02:38:28,514
because if you don't,
the guy will pull your arm off so you 

3454
02:38:29,691 --> 02:38:31,160
put in the back of his head.
So like,

3455
02:38:31,580 --> 02:38:35,700
we need environments that,
uh,

3456
02:38:36,050 --> 02:38:40,580
encourage genuine inquirers and 
questions and that here's the problem so

3457
02:38:40,590 --> 02:38:42,020
that someone could say,
well,

3458
02:38:42,021 --> 02:38:42,854
what if someone goes in there and starts
shouting racial epitaphs or horrible 

3459
02:38:45,561 --> 02:38:46,250
things?
Okay,

3460
02:38:46,250 --> 02:38:47,570
well there are a bad person.
Well,

3461
02:38:47,571 --> 02:38:49,250
they're horrible.
They're a file person.

3462
02:38:49,310 --> 02:38:50,143
But that's a,
that's what should be clear to 

3463
02:38:51,141 --> 02:38:51,974
everybody.
And the only way that's going to be 

3464
02:38:52,881 --> 02:38:55,580
clear to everybody is if you allow open 
thinking,

3465
02:38:55,790 --> 02:38:56,623
open speech and allow people to express 
themselves and you accumulate all that 

3466
02:38:59,241 --> 02:39:02,420
data and you get an understanding of 
what is okay and what's not okay,

3467
02:39:02,421 --> 02:39:03,890
what's hurtful,
what's not hurtful.

3468
02:39:04,160 --> 02:39:07,820
And if you're constantly in an 
environment where you don't even,

3469
02:39:07,850 --> 02:39:09,260
you know,
the monkey hear no evil,

3470
02:39:09,740 --> 02:39:10,573
you can't even hear a bad idea when 
someone does something legitimately 

3471
02:39:14,540 --> 02:39:17,000
horrible,
what would the reaction be?

3472
02:39:17,090 --> 02:39:20,720
Your threshold.
We'll constantly be decreasing.

3473
02:39:20,721 --> 02:39:21,554
If you're not hearing ideas right?
If you're not hearing ideas that run 

3474
02:39:24,381 --> 02:39:28,460
contrary or you know,
challenging than your threshold for what

3475
02:39:28,461 --> 02:39:30,440
you find offensive will constantly 
lower.

3476
02:39:30,560 --> 02:39:33,890
So then anything will offend you.
I had Thaddeus Russell on,

3477
02:39:34,010 --> 02:39:34,843
uh,
who's a great guy and he teaches at a 

3478
02:39:36,590 --> 02:39:39,440
occidental and we were talking about 
that,

3479
02:39:39,441 --> 02:39:42,140
um,
issue where there was a,

3480
02:39:42,141 --> 02:39:46,160
a young man and a young woman who got 
together and they got drunk and they had

3481
02:39:46,161 --> 02:39:48,590
some consent.
The girl decided that,

3482
02:39:49,090 --> 02:39:50,750
uh,
either she decided,

3483
02:39:50,751 --> 02:39:51,584
her friends convinced her into it,
that she had been raped even though she 

3484
02:39:53,871 --> 02:39:56,300
had sent him a bunch of text messages 
saying,

3485
02:39:56,301 --> 02:39:57,890
are you coming over?
Bring condoms,

3486
02:39:58,130 --> 02:40:00,170
told their friends I'm getting laid,
lol.

3487
02:40:00,470 --> 02:40:02,450
And uh,
he had gotten to her,

3488
02:40:02,451 --> 02:40:05,300
they were both intoxicated,
but because he's a man,

3489
02:40:05,690 --> 02:40:09,260
he was kicked off the campus.
He was kicked out of school.

3490
02:40:09,261 --> 02:40:11,240
He's,
they're suing is a big lawsuit.

3491
02:40:11,360 --> 02:40:13,560
She stayed,
they both sex.

3492
02:40:13,561 --> 02:40:13,980
There was no

3493
02:40:13,980 --> 02:40:15,570
force.
There was no,

3494
02:40:15,850 --> 02:40:18,150
there was no,
no lies.

3495
02:40:18,180 --> 02:40:21,060
There's no,
no one held anyone down.

3496
02:40:21,120 --> 02:40:23,370
No one did,
did anything against anyone's will.

3497
02:40:23,460 --> 02:40:24,293
But they had decided that he had 
committed sexual assault because they 

3498
02:40:27,061 --> 02:40:29,220
were both drunk and they could not 
consent,

3499
02:40:29,790 --> 02:40:32,670
which is fucking insane.
End Rady.

3500
02:40:32,671 --> 02:40:34,050
Ready?
Sexist.

3501
02:40:34,051 --> 02:40:34,771
Yeah,
that's right.

3502
02:40:34,771 --> 02:40:36,840
It's sexist.
It's sexist towards men.

3503
02:40:36,870 --> 02:40:38,420
And if that's just in the pot,
it just,

3504
02:40:38,490 --> 02:40:39,630
it disempowers women.
Yes,

3505
02:40:39,631 --> 02:40:40,381
it does.
It also,

3506
02:40:40,381 --> 02:40:41,214
it's ridiculous because how come you are
responsible for your own actions and 

3507
02:40:44,401 --> 02:40:46,350
every other realm?
If you drive a car and you're drunk,

3508
02:40:46,351 --> 02:40:47,184
you can't say,
well,

3509
02:40:47,280 --> 02:40:48,061
Hey,
I was drunk.

3510
02:40:48,061 --> 02:40:51,270
I'm not responsible for plowing into 
that fucking school bus full of kids.

3511
02:40:51,570 --> 02:40:53,250
You can't say that.
But if you say,

3512
02:40:53,251 --> 02:40:54,084
hey,
I was drunk.

3513
02:40:54,090 --> 02:40:57,750
I'm not responsible for my consent to 
have sex with this man.

3514
02:40:57,960 --> 02:40:58,830
That was preposterous.

3515
02:40:58,830 --> 02:41:01,530
We all know that alcohol limits your 
inhibitions.

3516
02:41:01,531 --> 02:41:04,200
It lowers your inhibitions and it makes 
you do things you might regret.

3517
02:41:04,380 --> 02:41:05,213
But there's a,
there's a big thing amongst people 

3518
02:41:07,490 --> 02:41:10,320
online that are trying to say this and 
pass it on.

3519
02:41:10,770 --> 02:41:13,740
Regret does not equal rape.
People make mistakes.

3520
02:41:14,100 --> 02:41:15,900
We've all made mistakes.
Everyone's made was,

3521
02:41:15,950 --> 02:41:17,910
and if you drink,
you're going to make more mistakes.

3522
02:41:17,940 --> 02:41:18,773
That's just a fact.
But that doesn't mean that the person 

3523
02:41:20,011 --> 02:41:22,080
you made a mistake with is a fucking 
rapist.

3524
02:41:22,081 --> 02:41:22,914
Now,
they've also made a mistake and maybe 

3525
02:41:24,331 --> 02:41:25,380
not,
maybe,

3526
02:41:25,410 --> 02:41:26,243
maybe you guys just had sex and maybe 
you're around a bunch of fucking nutty 

3527
02:41:28,981 --> 02:41:29,814
people who are trying to convince you 
that anytime you have sex and you're 

3528
02:41:31,741 --> 02:41:32,574
drunk,
you've been raped and there is a lot of 

3529
02:41:34,201 --> 02:41:35,034
that too loud.
So I was going to say that's a cultural 

3530
02:41:36,331 --> 02:41:37,164
problem.
Now look at it from the view of the 

3531
02:41:38,461 --> 02:41:39,270
administrator.

3532
02:41:39,270 --> 02:41:41,490
Right?
So from the view of the administrator,

3533
02:41:42,160 --> 02:41:43,020
students,
Dell,

3534
02:41:43,021 --> 02:41:45,360
after his job and those guys have 
couched jobs,

3535
02:41:45,361 --> 02:41:47,340
man,
they have cush up 300,000.

3536
02:41:47,341 --> 02:41:50,640
They get parking spaces and everything.
I mean they have parking spaces are big.

3537
02:41:50,730 --> 02:41:51,563
Parking spaces are huge.
The sign Mr. Wilson to sign it just is 

3538
02:41:56,130 --> 02:41:57,330
ready.
Let me sweep it.

3539
02:41:58,390 --> 02:41:59,870
Pulling your test Ya.
Yeah.

3540
02:41:59,880 --> 02:42:01,260
So,
so the Tesla,

3541
02:42:01,320 --> 02:42:02,940
so,
so those guys,

3542
02:42:03,480 --> 02:42:04,750
um,
so,

3543
02:42:04,751 --> 02:42:05,584
so those,
those administrative guys as a 

3544
02:42:06,820 --> 02:42:09,030
microaggression,
how dare you microaggressed me.

3545
02:42:09,300 --> 02:42:10,680
So those,
those folks,

3546
02:42:10,770 --> 02:42:12,600
I prefer Z.
Yeah.

3547
02:42:12,810 --> 02:42:14,250
Oh,
which is funny,

3548
02:42:14,370 --> 02:42:15,203
a funny story.
There's a story at U s s story about at 

3549
02:42:18,390 --> 02:42:20,790
the university about this.
So again,

3550
02:42:20,791 --> 02:42:23,250
I have no problem calling somebody,
you know,

3551
02:42:23,340 --> 02:42:25,760
he looks like a she or whatever you 
want.

3552
02:42:25,761 --> 02:42:29,370
Hit a couple of quick stories.
So I had a,

3553
02:42:29,640 --> 02:42:31,260
I take attendance.
It's long story,

3554
02:42:31,261 --> 02:42:33,570
why I take attendance,
just run with it.

3555
02:42:34,050 --> 02:42:36,300
So I get this,
uh,

3556
02:42:36,470 --> 02:42:39,630
this very attractive young woman comes 
up to me at the end of class.

3557
02:42:39,631 --> 02:42:40,464
I'm kind of discombobulated,
got all the shit in my head and she 

3558
02:42:42,271 --> 02:42:46,140
hands me this note.
And so you can get out of it if you have

3559
02:42:46,141 --> 02:42:50,290
a jury duty military orders,
um,

3560
02:42:50,490 --> 02:42:52,180
doctor's note,
uh,

3561
02:42:52,250 --> 02:42:54,300
excuse from my boss's boss,
the dean or whatever.

3562
02:42:54,301 --> 02:42:56,490
So in that way,
and just in case I'm audited,

3563
02:42:56,491 --> 02:42:57,390
right,
if I'm audited,

3564
02:42:57,391 --> 02:42:58,120
I can say,
or I,

3565
02:42:58,120 --> 02:42:59,160
if I say,
hey,

3566
02:42:59,161 --> 02:43:01,230
why did this person get off of this?
But I didn't,

3567
02:43:01,280 --> 02:43:02,220
you know,
do anything.

3568
02:43:02,221 --> 02:43:04,050
And then next thing you know,
she's paying me,

3569
02:43:04,051 --> 02:43:05,160
I'm sleeping with who know,
it just,

3570
02:43:05,190 --> 02:43:08,400
it's just so much easier for me.
So I'm reading this note and it said,

3571
02:43:08,760 --> 02:43:12,310
would you please excuse Mr. So,
and from this

3572
02:43:12,760 --> 02:43:15,460
thing and his,
his sis system is,

3573
02:43:15,461 --> 02:43:17,460
but whatever it was.
And I'm looking at this like,

3574
02:43:17,750 --> 02:43:18,820
who's,
who's,

3575
02:43:18,970 --> 02:43:22,210
who's Mr Saul and saul and I lived as a,
I don't,

3576
02:43:22,211 --> 02:43:23,044
I'm so w is their friends,
I don't know have any idealize what 

3577
02:43:25,090 --> 02:43:26,740
she's handing me this note should own.
I'm,

3578
02:43:26,800 --> 02:43:31,800
I'm Mr so and so.
And it took me a second and it took me a

3579
02:43:31,991 --> 02:43:32,824
moment.
I had to like process that I didn't say 

3580
02:43:35,381 --> 02:43:37,390
anything about it.
I'm like,

3581
02:43:37,420 --> 02:43:38,253
oh,
that's great.

3582
02:43:38,260 --> 02:43:39,340
Because if I do,
you know,

3583
02:43:39,341 --> 02:43:41,980
if people do demand something and,
and they'll say,

3584
02:43:41,981 --> 02:43:43,840
well look,
this person gave you this,

3585
02:43:43,841 --> 02:43:45,880
this is not a Mr. And like you have a 
problem with that.

3586
02:43:46,240 --> 02:43:47,890
I mean,
I can pull the same regressive card that

3587
02:43:47,891 --> 02:43:50,680
they can you,
you're being homophobic,

3588
02:43:50,710 --> 02:43:52,660
you're being transphobic or whatever it 
is.

3589
02:43:53,290 --> 02:43:54,123
So,
so people have been choosing their own 

3590
02:43:55,841 --> 02:43:56,674
pronouns.
But the craziest thing that happened to 

3591
02:43:58,301 --> 02:44:03,280
a colleague of mine is he was told that,
and again,

3592
02:44:03,340 --> 02:44:06,250
I call anybody any pronoun you want,
you want to be called Z.

3593
02:44:06,251 --> 02:44:07,084
I've got no,
I got bigger shit to where the h e m 

3594
02:44:09,540 --> 02:44:11,140
problem.
That's three e's.

3595
02:44:11,380 --> 02:44:15,120
I'll spell it out for you every time.
Sh so,

3596
02:44:15,280 --> 02:44:18,240
so this person wanted to be called,
uh,

3597
02:44:18,580 --> 02:44:20,240
I can't remember what the days were,
but certainly

3598
02:44:20,260 --> 02:44:21,610
daisy,
he,

3599
02:44:21,611 --> 02:44:23,920
she mm.
And he made it

3600
02:44:23,980 --> 02:44:27,520
mistake,
my colleague made a mistake and all hell

3601
02:44:27,521 --> 02:44:28,990
broke loose.
What was the mistake?

3602
02:44:29,380 --> 02:44:31,990
He calls pushy on the wrong thing like 
that.

3603
02:44:31,991 --> 02:44:32,461
Yeah.
And,

3604
02:44:32,461 --> 02:44:33,310
and she said,
you know,

3605
02:44:33,311 --> 02:44:34,310
okay,
don't do that again.

3606
02:44:34,311 --> 02:44:36,160
And evidently he did that again or 
something.

3607
02:44:36,220 --> 02:44:37,750
I don't know.
So now

3608
02:44:45,080 --> 02:44:47,150
whatever happened to people just being 
fucking crazy.

3609
02:44:47,280 --> 02:44:49,130
It's not an option.
Is that possible?

3610
02:44:49,430 --> 02:44:50,263
You know,
I was watching a video listening to a 

3611
02:44:51,471 --> 02:44:55,010
radio lab podcast and they were 
interviewing this guy who got a guy.

3612
02:44:55,011 --> 02:44:56,810
Sometimes,
sometimes it's a girl,

3613
02:44:56,960 --> 02:45:00,650
sometimes it goes back and forth and his
gender is fluid and in the middle of the

3614
02:45:00,651 --> 02:45:03,080
conversations like I just switched.
I'm a guy now.

3615
02:45:03,680 --> 02:45:05,140
I just switched.
I just felt it.

3616
02:45:05,141 --> 02:45:05,974
It was immediate.
Like I'm listening to this and I'm 

3617
02:45:08,091 --> 02:45:08,571
going,
well,

3618
02:45:08,571 --> 02:45:13,571
this is a fucking idiot.
Clearly this is obviously a nutty person

3619
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:19,000
that has a very loose,
slippery mineral oil grip on reality.

3620
02:45:20,421 --> 02:45:21,254
It's like what just flies were out of 
their fingers and they want you to give 

3621
02:45:25,281 --> 02:45:29,810
in to this slippery reality and focus on
them constantly.

3622
02:45:29,960 --> 02:45:30,793
Now he now mushy.
It's another way to divert attention 

3623
02:45:33,561 --> 02:45:34,394
from anything that's going on and focus 
it on them and something completely 

3624
02:45:37,581 --> 02:45:38,720
trivial like that.

3625
02:45:38,720 --> 02:45:41,260
They decide there are female,
they decided they're a male.

3626
02:45:41,360 --> 02:45:43,490
What?
What the fuck are you talking about?

3627
02:45:43,620 --> 02:45:46,370
And I don't even,
I don't even care if,

3628
02:45:46,790 --> 02:45:50,630
if it's pointless piece feel different.
Different Times of the day.

3629
02:45:50,840 --> 02:45:52,700
If you feel different sexually,
if you're,

3630
02:45:52,701 --> 02:45:53,534
you know,
you're pansexual or it's just you're 

3631
02:45:55,851 --> 02:45:56,684
just thinking too much and projecting,
you're projecting that off on other 

3632
02:46:00,381 --> 02:46:01,214
people.
If you really think that you become 

3633
02:46:03,110 --> 02:46:03,943
transgender,
we assist gender and all like it 

3634
02:46:06,501 --> 02:46:08,840
switches back and forth all throughout 
the day.

3635
02:46:08,960 --> 02:46:11,420
You're probably fucking crazy.
Was it?

3636
02:46:11,480 --> 02:46:12,313
Was it you who tweeted the link about 
the guy who is a six year old girl or 

3637
02:46:15,291 --> 02:46:18,860
eight year old girl is 52 year old man 
and a,

3638
02:46:18,861 --> 02:46:21,950
he's a father and he has decided that 
now he's a six year old girl.

3639
02:46:22,010 --> 02:46:23,030
All right.
I love it.

3640
02:46:23,990 --> 02:46:26,050
He should be a six year old fox.
I'm a,

3641
02:46:26,051 --> 02:46:27,080
I'm going to be a Fox.

3642
02:46:27,280 --> 02:46:28,220
No,
I'm an owl.

3643
02:46:28,580 --> 02:46:32,060
I'm an eagle.
I identify with trees.

3644
02:46:32,210 --> 02:46:33,950
I'm just going to stand here.
Don't judge.

3645
02:46:34,110 --> 02:46:36,080
So,
so instead of,

3646
02:46:36,081 --> 02:46:36,914
so here's,
so have a hat with apple's hanging from 

3647
02:46:38,331 --> 02:46:39,164
it that don't disrespect this is real.
So I think that's part of the problem 

3648
02:46:44,451 --> 02:46:46,950
with not being able to Morley triage,
right?

3649
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:47,833
It's part of the problem with not being 
triage is a great way to describe it 

3650
02:46:51,261 --> 02:46:52,820
too.
That's a great way to his crime.

3651
02:46:53,130 --> 02:46:54,140
So,
so instead of saying,

3652
02:46:54,141 --> 02:46:54,651
okay,
look,

3653
02:46:54,651 --> 02:46:56,600
this guy,
whatever's going on in his,

3654
02:46:56,610 --> 02:46:58,400
her life person,
that's Z,

3655
02:46:58,401 --> 02:46:59,440
whatever,
fine,

3656
02:46:59,510 --> 02:47:00,360
great run with it.
I,

3657
02:47:00,740 --> 02:47:03,200
it's just not,
it's not worth my time.

3658
02:47:03,220 --> 02:47:05,720
Yeah.
If a guy wants to be trivial world girl,

3659
02:47:05,750 --> 02:47:06,583
you go forward.
I think we have a problem with mister 

3660
02:47:07,701 --> 02:47:09,920
and misses and all that shit.
How about we just abandoned it.

3661
02:47:10,100 --> 02:47:10,820
Your name's Peter.

3662
02:47:10,820 --> 02:47:14,270
My name's Joe and make a fucking noise.
That means that's like my,

3663
02:47:14,300 --> 02:47:15,133
my,
my issue with this whole Caitlin Jenner 

3664
02:47:16,071 --> 02:47:16,904
thing.
Cause like you have to call her Caitlyn 

3665
02:47:18,261 --> 02:47:19,400
now.
It's a shitty car.

3666
02:47:19,401 --> 02:47:22,610
Caitlin,
I've been calling this fucking person is

3667
02:47:22,611 --> 02:47:26,120
one noise that I make with my mouth my 
whole life.

3668
02:47:26,480 --> 02:47:29,960
In the Diane Sawyer interview,
he said he and he said,

3669
02:47:29,961 --> 02:47:32,360
Bruce,
I'm sticking with that.

3670
02:47:32,750 --> 02:47:36,020
You can't keep making new noises that I 
have to make with my face.

3671
02:47:36,021 --> 02:47:36,854
They make you feel better about yourself
because if that's all it takes for you 

3672
02:47:38,691 --> 02:47:41,240
to feel better about yourself is people 
call you a new noise.

3673
02:47:41,360 --> 02:47:43,550
That's ridiculous.
If I decide tomorrow,

3674
02:47:43,551 --> 02:47:45,350
my,
my new name is Sheila,

3675
02:47:45,530 --> 02:47:48,230
I want everybody to call me Sheila.
But you just laughed.

3676
02:47:48,231 --> 02:47:50,400
That's a micro aggression.
There is a microaggression.

3677
02:47:50,930 --> 02:47:52,010
Why wide?
What?

3678
02:47:52,370 --> 02:47:53,203
Joe is a boring ass fucking stupid name 
and I've got stuck with that boring ass 

3679
02:47:56,661 --> 02:47:57,260
stupid name.

3680
02:47:57,260 --> 02:47:59,720
This is how boring ass stupid.
My Dad's name is Joe.

3681
02:47:59,810 --> 02:48:03,230
My grandfather's name is Joe.
My grandmother's name is Josephine.

3682
02:48:03,410 --> 02:48:06,560
Bunch of fucking unoriginal,
uncreative fucks in my family.

3683
02:48:06,860 --> 02:48:07,693
So what,
it's just a noise that you make with 

3684
02:48:09,051 --> 02:48:12,080
your face when you say,
hey joe to me and my,

3685
02:48:12,150 --> 02:48:15,200
my friend Joey is right behind me and I 
don't know which Joe after look.

3686
02:48:15,320 --> 02:48:16,410
Oh No,
you've,

3687
02:48:16,430 --> 02:48:19,670
you've microaggressed me again cause I 
don't know what Joe you're referring to.

3688
02:48:19,760 --> 02:48:22,070
This is a noise that you make that 
represents you.

3689
02:48:22,130 --> 02:48:23,830
Who gives a shit?
Is it,

3690
02:48:23,970 --> 02:48:25,730
those are some noises.
They're feminine.

3691
02:48:25,880 --> 02:48:27,530
There was some noises that are 
ambiguous,

3692
02:48:27,550 --> 02:48:28,101
right?
You know,

3693
02:48:28,101 --> 02:48:29,690
like it's Pat,
remember that?

3694
02:48:30,050 --> 02:48:30,883
I'm not fucking show.
We couldn't figure out what gender she 

3695
02:48:32,121 --> 02:48:34,100
was.
There's women named shelly,

3696
02:48:34,220 --> 02:48:35,870
there's men named shelly.
Fuck,

3697
02:48:35,871 --> 02:48:36,590
what are we,
Chris.

3698
02:48:36,590 --> 02:48:37,423
Christine.
There's genes that are girls and genes 

3699
02:48:39,321 --> 02:48:39,780
that are guides.

3700
02:48:39,780 --> 02:48:41,750
So,
so confusing.

3701
02:48:41,751 --> 02:48:45,110
So you see how crazy that is?
It is confusing.

3702
02:48:45,230 --> 02:48:46,063
But here's what makes it worse.
What makes it worse is that if you make 

3703
02:48:49,401 --> 02:48:50,690
a mistake,
there's,

3704
02:48:50,840 --> 02:48:51,673
there's a rule to punish you.
Like right now you have your operating 

3705
02:48:55,161 --> 02:48:56,360
freely.
You have no rules.

3706
02:48:56,960 --> 02:49:00,890
People in people out that their pr,
they're paranoid.

3707
02:49:01,010 --> 02:49:05,840
They're paranoid about making a mistake.
So of course,

3708
02:49:06,230 --> 02:49:07,950
I mean that's just the way it is.
I mean,

3709
02:49:08,700 --> 02:49:11,130
when,
when you have a bunch of people that are

3710
02:49:11,131 --> 02:49:15,720
hypersensitive and that are trying to 
enforce these ridiculous ideas on people

3711
02:49:15,930 --> 02:49:17,580
and they're trying to pound these things
down,

3712
02:49:17,730 --> 02:49:21,930
they're looking for these moments with 
aiken solidify.

3713
02:49:21,931 --> 02:49:24,780
This is the moment.
So they could point at you these moments

3714
02:49:24,781 --> 02:49:25,614
where I call them green lights are 
called them green lights because they 

3715
02:49:28,801 --> 02:49:30,870
might not be upset.
They might not really be upset,

3716
02:49:30,871 --> 02:49:32,610
but they have a green light to act 
upset.

3717
02:49:32,900 --> 02:49:35,130
Yeah,
there's their battery.

3718
02:49:35,131 --> 02:49:36,540
You know,
my whole buffalo battery,

3719
02:49:36,541 --> 02:49:37,374
that's where I found one.
And they have community support because 

3720
02:49:41,131 --> 02:49:43,890
now the victim is the highest level.
Yeah.

3721
02:49:43,920 --> 02:49:46,530
And they're all social retards.
The other part of the problem,

3722
02:49:47,160 --> 02:49:49,320
and I say retards,
he'll like,

3723
02:49:49,321 --> 02:49:50,760
you know,
it's politically incorrect.

3724
02:49:50,761 --> 02:49:51,594
Word retarded means slowed.
And the that is socially retarded to 

3725
02:49:56,461 --> 02:49:57,960
like operate this way.
It's,

3726
02:49:57,961 --> 02:49:59,640
it's,
it's slows everything down.

3727
02:49:59,641 --> 02:50:00,630
It's,
it's awkward.

3728
02:50:00,631 --> 02:50:03,210
It's confusing.
It's not necessary.

3729
02:50:03,390 --> 02:50:06,300
What's necessary is friendship,
kindness,

3730
02:50:06,360 --> 02:50:08,400
compassion,
open mindedness.

3731
02:50:08,580 --> 02:50:11,670
And those things don't exist when you 
were pointing fingers at people.

3732
02:50:11,700 --> 02:50:14,460
Right.
And shaming them over innocuous things.

3733
02:50:14,461 --> 02:50:15,390
Right.
Like you,

3734
02:50:15,391 --> 02:50:17,280
Oh,
you called her a she on Thursday,

3735
02:50:17,300 --> 02:50:19,260
right?
You fuck she's he on Thursday.

3736
02:50:19,500 --> 02:50:20,430
Right.
Come on in.

3737
02:50:20,431 --> 02:50:23,850
And this is nonsense that acts against 
their own interest.

3738
02:50:24,210 --> 02:50:26,760
That creates adversary relationships.
Cause then you're like,

3739
02:50:26,800 --> 02:50:28,480
oh,
Caitlin.

3740
02:50:28,590 --> 02:50:29,423
You know,
could you just make them socially 

3741
02:50:30,091 --> 02:50:30,924
spoiled?

3742
02:50:30,990 --> 02:50:31,950
I mean,
that's what you're doing.

3743
02:50:32,010 --> 02:50:33,540
That's exactly what you're doing.
Yeah.

3744
02:50:33,620 --> 02:50:34,710
Yeah.
We're out of time.

3745
02:50:34,850 --> 02:50:35,540
All right,
cool.

3746
02:50:35,540 --> 02:50:36,373
Fucking hammered it out for three hours.
I don't say we've changed the Goddamn 

3747
02:50:38,670 --> 02:50:40,290
thing about the world,
but a three hour thing.

3748
02:50:40,291 --> 02:50:41,880
Yes we did.
We just did three hours.

3749
02:50:42,200 --> 02:50:43,350
Well,
thank you Peter.

3750
02:50:43,351 --> 02:50:45,990
I really appreciate it.
If people want to find you on twitter,

3751
02:50:46,200 --> 02:50:48,150
it's a Peter Boghossian,

I.

3756
02:50:51,720 --> 02:50:52,620
N.
Uh,

3757
02:50:52,650 --> 02:50:53,483
he's probably gonna be fired from his 
job at Portland State University after 

3758
02:50:55,891 --> 02:50:57,810
this podcast.
So please,

3759
02:50:57,811 --> 02:50:58,411
uh,
you know,

3760
02:50:58,411 --> 02:50:59,244
open up a patrion page and that's the 
request I call those social justice 

3761
02:51:02,101 --> 02:51:03,780
freaks.
Anything else?

3762
02:51:04,200 --> 02:51:04,971
Thank you.
Thank you.

3763
02:51:04,971 --> 02:51:06,060
I appreciate.
Let's do this again.

3764
02:51:06,061 --> 02:51:07,010
This is a lot of fun.
Thanks.

3765
02:51:07,090 --> 02:51:08,180
All right,
Peter Goes,

3766
02:51:08,181 --> 02:51:09,014
the young ladies and gentlemen,
we'll be back at 2:00 PM with the 

3767
02:51:10,801 --> 02:51:13,530
fighter and the kid,
Brian Cowen and Brendan Schaub.

3768
02:51:13,531 --> 02:51:17,100
We're going to have a UFC one 94 recap.
Holla.

3769
02:51:32,890 --> 02:51:33,723
Yeah.
