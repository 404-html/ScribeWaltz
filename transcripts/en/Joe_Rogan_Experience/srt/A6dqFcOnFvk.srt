Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,480
You can converse in like an a type the
type of English we're talking right now

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:08,343
almost,

4
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:13,120
which creates this weird tension between
the things that you're discussing and

5
00:00:13,121 --> 00:00:14,320
how you're discussing them.

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:15,581
Like for instance,

7
00:00:15,581 --> 00:00:20,581
to have a guy just in conversational
English talking about problems they're

8
00:00:20,591 --> 00:00:25,240
having with neighboring schamens and
their own Sharman putting curses on each

9
00:00:25,241 --> 00:00:26,770
other and it like creates like,

10
00:00:26,771 --> 00:00:30,880
there's like a strange tension between
like how it's being conveyed to you.

11
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,553
You know,

12
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:33,341
like how,

13
00:00:33,341 --> 00:00:34,390
so like,

14
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:35,283
okay,

15
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,300
if you're talking conversational English,

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,740
I guess like a life,

17
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,770
it's almost like you'd want it
to be when he's telling you this,

18
00:00:41,771 --> 00:00:46,771
you'd almost want to be reading it in
like closed caption and he'd be saying it

19
00:00:47,411 --> 00:00:52,411
in the indigenous language because it
sounds weird to have to have an idea

20
00:00:52,841 --> 00:00:54,550
that's so foreign to us,

21
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,530
which would be like a battle of schamens
battling over access to wild animals.

22
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:00,693
Okay.

23
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,480
Um,

24
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,110
to have that delivered in conversational
English has struck me as unusual.

25
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,210
And because like usually
when you're traveling,

26
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,710
you're getting all of your information
like traveling and Bolivia,

27
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:15,970
a guy would tell a story
and he'd tell a story in um,

28
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,660
Sim Shyanne no one was staying
in that same Shan Chimani.

29
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:20,410
Okay.

30
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:24,580
He tells story in Chimani to
a person who spoke Spanish.

31
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:28,660
The person who speaks Spanish
would tell it to a person.

32
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:30,110
No,

33
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:30,200
no,

34
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,033
no.

35
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:34,630
Chimani guy telling someone
who speaks Chimani in Spanish.

36
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:40,560
Then that person telling it to a person
who speaks Spanish and English and then

37
00:01:41,231 --> 00:01:43,420
that person giving you the information.

38
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:48,040
When you get it through that
it takes on a mystical quality.

39
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:51,040
Like you're crossing
some space time thing,

40
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,020
right.

41
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,140
Where you're seeing like these ideas
discussed in their ancestral tongue.

42
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:57,280
Okay.

43
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:57,920
Yeah.

44
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,300
Tamara sent you a video of a guy
talking about killing a Jaguar.

45
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:01,900
Yes.

46
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,590
Right.

47
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,110
The language you've never like
when he's speaking you're like,

48
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,610
I've never in all my travels,

49
00:02:06,611 --> 00:02:07,500
I've never heard of language.

50
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:08,920
It sounds anything like that

51
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,040
right here.

52
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:11,251
Yeah.

53
00:02:11,251 --> 00:02:11,940
I don't want to leave.

54
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,110
You can use a Kombucha bottle.

55
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:13,291
Yeah,

56
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:13,471
man.

57
00:02:13,471 --> 00:02:14,620
It's the healthiest for all of the PD.

58
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,540
You've done this twice.

59
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:16,020
Really?

60
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:16,291
Yeah.

61
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:17,940
We've done this on the podcast for great.

62
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:18,780
For sure.

63
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,700
I liked the fact that you're
willing to do that too.

64
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,920
I don't think we could
show it on youtube though,

65
00:02:22,921 --> 00:02:23,754
so we'll have to,

66
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,180
we'll have to move away up or
he's got his dick out great too.

67
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:28,650
Cause I got a big opening.

68
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,191
Yeah.

69
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:30,570
So it doesn't vacuum up.

70
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,480
How often dup dup several times.

71
00:02:33,481 --> 00:02:34,060
Every day.

72
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:34,650
Every day.

73
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,140
You like one of them are
healthy water drinker dudes.

74
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,063
I PLR.

75
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,151
Do you,

76
00:02:39,151 --> 00:02:40,260
are you a healthy water drinker?

77
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:40,770
Dude?

78
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,010
Interesting detail.

79
00:02:42,011 --> 00:02:42,810
This just happened.

80
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:42,901
Oh,

81
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:43,710
you ran out?

82
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,543
I don't know.

83
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,600
Uh,

84
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,433
hold on a second.

85
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,110
I to go to the recycling.

86
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,260
Got It's all right.

87
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:50,890
I'm pitching.

88
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,280
I've got a strong grip as you can move,

89
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,900
but it's all have to take it lightly.

90
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:56,721
Touching them.

91
00:02:56,721 --> 00:02:57,554
A bottle.

92
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,620
A cop,

93
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,350
not a bottle.

94
00:02:59,350 --> 00:02:59,801
Hold on,

95
00:02:59,801 --> 00:03:00,270
hold on.

96
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:00,490
Oh,

97
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,323
model.

98
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:01,980
Seems like.

99
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,321
Oh man,

100
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:03,250
it's going back in though.

101
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,420
I can feel it starting to swell back yet.

102
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,463
That's unhealthy.

103
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,100
I'm putting,

104
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,220
I've been pitching too long.

105
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,800
Should I pay into the cup or bottle yet?

106
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:11,951
Oh,

107
00:03:11,951 --> 00:03:12,700
you emptied it.

108
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:12,821
Oh,

109
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:13,654
thanks man.

110
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:17,501
Oh yeah.

111
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:19,000
A lot went back into my urethra.

112
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,710
Ari should fear,

113
00:03:20,711 --> 00:03:21,544
uh,

114
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,350
couldn't hold in his pee.

115
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,400
Ladies and gentlemen.

116
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:28,210
Couldn't means wouldn't
filled up one Kombucha bottle.

117
00:03:28,211 --> 00:03:31,570
Here's a cap they're feeling
and then fill it up again.

118
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:32,940
I had to go empty it out for him.

119
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,680
Thanks for doing that.

120
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:36,923
Applies on the front.

121
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,110
Yeah.

122
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,130
I didn't want to leave
you hanging in there,

123
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:39,930
dude.

124
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:40,390
Really?

125
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,350
There was only one solution.

126
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:44,140
I almost went to the kitchen
sink and then I put it like,

127
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:44,450
Ooh.

128
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,700
Then we'd have to rinse that out.

129
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,520
That shit would be nasty there.

130
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:49,900
That bathroom sick as nasty.

131
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:51,010
You're going to have a cleaner in here?

132
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:51,903
No,

133
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:52,511
it's like,

134
00:03:52,511 --> 00:03:53,500
it looks like a bachelor.

135
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,160
We're on our way out of the spot.

136
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,573
Oh Man.

137
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:57,963
It's not that bad.

138
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:01,320
I just use the time to fucking tweet
about my new record saying had I kept

139
00:04:01,321 --> 00:04:02,550
tweeting that James Comey was,

140
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,470
it was all code for my new record,

141
00:04:04,471 --> 00:04:05,370
that he wanted people to buy it.

142
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:05,941
I know.

143
00:04:05,941 --> 00:04:09,360
I saw some of the Instagram posts and
how to call me endorsing your album.

144
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:09,721
Yeah.

145
00:04:09,721 --> 00:04:10,441
He's a big fan.

146
00:04:10,441 --> 00:04:10,621
He,

147
00:04:10,621 --> 00:04:10,850
he,

148
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:11,130
he,

149
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,620
he said he wanted to talk about it
during the hearings cause that's a big

150
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:14,070
audience.

151
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,170
But apparently they wouldn't let them go.

152
00:04:16,171 --> 00:04:16,381
Yeah.

153
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,690
Collusion between me and Comi
would have fucked things up.

154
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:19,650
Is that what it's called?

155
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:20,820
Yeah,

156
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,653
it's uh,

157
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:22,531
well I actually,

158
00:04:22,531 --> 00:04:23,620
it's funny cause this guy,

159
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:24,781
cause there's,

160
00:04:24,781 --> 00:04:28,290
they say there's a chance which looking
less like there's this guy Luke combs

161
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:30,450
who's like my arch nemesis
even though he's a good dude.

162
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:31,930
I just,

163
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:35,370
he was up against me this week on the
country charts cause my album comes out,

164
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,590
my new album came out this week
and I'm trying to beat him.

165
00:04:37,591 --> 00:04:42,591
And I said on Twitter that Russians have
colluded with Sony records to like have

166
00:04:42,931 --> 00:04:44,790
him outsell me and he
kind of played along.

167
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:45,624
So we'll see.

168
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:46,051
I think,

169
00:04:46,051 --> 00:04:46,321
I think,

170
00:04:46,321 --> 00:04:47,131
I think they are,

171
00:04:47,131 --> 00:04:49,550
I mean Nashville is definitely
trying to keep me down,

172
00:04:49,551 --> 00:04:50,130
but

173
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:50,760
are they really,

174
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,481
are they fucking with you?

175
00:04:51,481 --> 00:04:51,960
Like how,

176
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,400
how were they receiving you now?

177
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,260
Now that you've become
a mainstream success?

178
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:56,820
Cause I hear about you all the time.

179
00:04:56,821 --> 00:04:58,020
Donald Cowboy Cerrone,

180
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,490
I think you know that he listens to your
music before he goes out and fights.

181
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:01,711
Oh,

182
00:05:01,711 --> 00:05:03,630
cowboy Cerrone reached
out to me thanks to you.

183
00:05:03,631 --> 00:05:04,050
He called,

184
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:08,550
he called me up and he was on the set
of a movie with Michael Madsen and uh,

185
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:09,750
they go,

186
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,670
I don't know how it
seems like last second,

187
00:05:11,671 --> 00:05:12,390
but they go,

188
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:12,991
hey capital,

189
00:05:12,991 --> 00:05:15,660
you had a scene tomorrow where you
sing Karaoke with Michael Madsen.

190
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,140
And he saw you on saying,

191
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:17,640
and he's like,

192
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,500
fucking eating pussy
kicking ass producers.

193
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,810
Like fuck you talking about.

194
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:21,810
He's like,

195
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,310
I want to sing eating pussy kicking ass.

196
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:23,941
He's like,

197
00:05:23,941 --> 00:05:24,990
do you have the rights to this song?

198
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:25,230
He's like,

199
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,370
I'll have it in like five minutes.

200
00:05:26,371 --> 00:05:27,360
And he just fucking calls me.

201
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:31,170
I call my peoples like now I'm in a movie
with cowboy Cerrone and Michael Madsen

202
00:05:31,171 --> 00:05:32,580
singing and eating pussy kicking ass.

203
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:33,810
He said he was in the trailer,

204
00:05:33,811 --> 00:05:34,021
you know,

205
00:05:34,021 --> 00:05:34,680
like,

206
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,430
you know,

207
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,170
rehearsing with Michael
Madsen and you know,

208
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:38,700
it gets to the sucking Dick Parker.

209
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:39,823
I think he was just like,

210
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,100
what the fuck we sing in here?

211
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,120
So it's just the,

212
00:05:45,121 --> 00:05:45,600
uh,

213
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,510
it's the threat of losing
everything in moderation.

214
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:50,320
Yeah.

215
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,960
Being ostracized by and just sort of
expelled into this world that you believe

216
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:58,250
and have always believed
is as evil and without

217
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,083
hope and doomed.

218
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,020
So how did you do it?

219
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,860
How did your,

220
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:02,270
your,

221
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,290
you got all your stuff packed.

222
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:04,050
People are coming in,

223
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:04,760
they're saying,

224
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:04,971
yeah.

225
00:06:04,971 --> 00:06:05,631
I mean like they're,

226
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:05,901
they're,

227
00:06:05,901 --> 00:06:07,160
they're trying to convince us,

228
00:06:07,161 --> 00:06:10,640
but once they understand that
we're not being convinced that,

229
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:11,480
that,

230
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:11,721
you know,

231
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:12,050
they,

232
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:12,950
they walked away.

233
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:17,060
So I mean that night our dad dropped us
off at a hotel and then Jesus Christ.

234
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:17,470
Yeah.

235
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:17,760
Like it's,

236
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,020
it's,

237
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,810
it's so immediate that you become this,

238
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,770
you become other,

239
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,910
you become an outsider.

240
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,650
Like in the next morning
when we went back,

241
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:26,660
I rang the doorbell,

242
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:30,740
I rang the doorbell and I lived in
that house from the day I was born.

243
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:31,903
Whoa.

244
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,190
Felt like you had to ring the doorbell.

245
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,720
This is not my world anymore.

246
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:37,550
Wow.

247
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,001
Chris was like,

248
00:06:38,001 --> 00:06:39,110
why don't you ring the doorbell?

249
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:40,550
And it was like,

250
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:40,820
there's,

251
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,653
there's no other,

252
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:42,580
there's,

253
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,490
there is nothing else.

254
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:43,770
Like it's,

255
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:44,730
this is not our home.

256
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,460
It says not so we go and,

257
00:06:46,461 --> 00:06:46,701
you know,

258
00:06:46,701 --> 00:06:48,470
we're packing all of our things.

259
00:06:48,471 --> 00:06:49,070
It was just,

260
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,060
it was awful just to,

261
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,240
I had been in those four months,

262
00:06:53,241 --> 00:06:57,600
I had been so terrified of not
knowing what was coming like this.

263
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:02,090
Imagine you're going to lose everyone
in your life that they're just,

264
00:07:02,091 --> 00:07:03,050
you're just going to like,

265
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,400
you're not going to like how your
parents met and fell in love or like your

266
00:07:07,401 --> 00:07:12,401
grandparents and family recipes and photos
and memories and what did the house,

267
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,890
I'm like taking photos and voice
recordings and just all the time,

268
00:07:15,891 --> 00:07:17,090
like in every,

269
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:18,231
it was just,

270
00:07:18,231 --> 00:07:18,561
it's just,

271
00:07:18,561 --> 00:07:19,340
it's overwhelming.

272
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,173
It's just,

273
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,163
um,

274
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:26,750
it may be at least understand that the
source of my dissatisfaction in life

275
00:07:26,751 --> 00:07:27,980
wasn't internal.

276
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:29,480
It Wa it made sense.

277
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:34,481
It was that I was having a healthy
reaction to circumstances in society that,

278
00:07:34,851 --> 00:07:36,470
that humans were not adapted for.

279
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:41,650
And even that was enough to bring
a kind of peace of mind for me.

280
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:42,400
Um,

281
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,000
I also very consciously and deliberately
try to live in places where there is

282
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:47,960
the possibility of,

283
00:07:47,961 --> 00:07:48,794
of um,

284
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:49,310
uh,

285
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,690
sort of close communal neighborhood.

286
00:07:50,691 --> 00:07:55,130
I live in a very poor neighborhood in
New York City at which for some of the

287
00:07:55,131 --> 00:07:58,970
hassles at least has the sort of rich
fabric of human connection that you just

288
00:07:58,971 --> 00:08:00,140
don't get in wealthy neighborhoods.

289
00:08:00,141 --> 00:08:01,220
So you'd do it on purpose.

290
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,263
Oh yeah.

291
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,100
What would,

292
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,250
I don't want you to say,

293
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:05,450
where do you want to say where you live?

294
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,460
I live in lower east side
Manhattan and I mean,

295
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:07,881
he's not very,

296
00:08:07,881 --> 00:08:08,271
very poor,

297
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:08,631
but it's,

298
00:08:08,631 --> 00:08:08,781
it,

299
00:08:08,781 --> 00:08:08,921
you know,

300
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:10,910
is a Dominican to Dominican neighborhood,

301
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,670
have half the people in that neighborhood
really don't speak English very well.

302
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:14,001
So it's,

303
00:08:14,001 --> 00:08:14,151
you know,

304
00:08:14,151 --> 00:08:14,781
it's a very,

305
00:08:14,781 --> 00:08:16,730
it's a very rich or ethnic neighborhood.

306
00:08:16,731 --> 00:08:17,750
People are quite poor.

307
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:18,350
Um,

308
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:18,670
and,

309
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:19,670
and I know everybody and we,

310
00:08:19,671 --> 00:08:21,770
everyone knows each other by sight
and we look out for each other.

311
00:08:21,771 --> 00:08:22,310
And it's,

312
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:22,700
I mean,

313
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,540
during hurricane,

314
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:24,591
a hurricane,

315
00:08:24,591 --> 00:08:26,720
when hurricane sandy hit New York,

316
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:27,291
I mean,

317
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,840
a lot of the people that had young
children had to leave because there was no

318
00:08:29,841 --> 00:08:30,320
light,

319
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,250
there was no water.

320
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:34,130
The power was out right to half
of Manhattan was completely dark.

321
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:38,180
It was really actually quite dangerous
at night in the dark half a Manhattan

322
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:39,080
and,

323
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,391
uh,

324
00:08:39,391 --> 00:08:40,390
where there was no streetlights.

325
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,170
And,

326
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:41,660
um,

327
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:42,441
so this building,

328
00:08:42,441 --> 00:08:45,410
it's a tenement building that
I live in with my wife and um,

329
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:51,040
and a lot of the people left and that
they were worried about being robbed and

330
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,161
these are poor people,

331
00:08:52,161 --> 00:08:52,480
right?

332
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,960
It is not a wealthy building at all,

333
00:08:53,961 --> 00:08:54,500
is quite,

334
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,333
quite poor building.

335
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:56,520
And so they,

336
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:56,831
they,

337
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,320
they organized a guard shift.

338
00:08:58,321 --> 00:08:59,131
One of the people,

339
00:08:59,131 --> 00:09:02,880
one of the women in the building had a
machete and they organized guard shifts

340
00:09:02,881 --> 00:09:04,350
at the front door with
a machete and the young,

341
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,440
the young men in the building took turns
like two hours at a time guarding the

342
00:09:07,441 --> 00:09:08,280
building with a machete.

343
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,233
Oh yeah.

344
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,170
And um,

345
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:10,891
you know,

346
00:09:10,891 --> 00:09:13,350
I wasn't associated with
the building at that time,

347
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,020
but boy would that have made me
feel good to be part of that.

348
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,010
That,

349
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:17,491
you know what I mean?

350
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:18,810
Like that is what human beings,

351
00:09:18,811 --> 00:09:19,680
that's what they are.

352
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:20,340
Right.

353
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,360
It's that right.

354
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:21,910
And you,

355
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,940
you didn't see that in
a wealthy neighborhood,

356
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:27,420
partly because the wealthy
neighborhoods actually had light.

357
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,553
Right.

358
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:38,340
Okay.
