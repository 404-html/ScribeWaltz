00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,270
Greetings, ladies and gentlemen and people
who consider yourself neither. Folks,

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,420
it's them's that we live in strange times.

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,010
Sometimes people don't want to be
defined by a gender or anything.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,870
They're in it and I support
that. You go it, you go,

5
00:00:18,871 --> 00:00:22,770
girl, you go, boy, you go,
whatever the fuck you want to be.

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,860
You go furries.
You go mascots.

the best legal minds in the country,

25
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:39,480
attorney if the whole process
becomes confusing and you're saying,

26
00:01:39,481 --> 00:01:41,160
I don't know if what I'm doing is legal.

27
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:46,440
Legal Zoom will connect you to an
independent attorney. It's not a law firm,

28
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,970

30
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:55,290
you don't have to go anywhere,

31
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:58,470
you don't have to pay someone
some ridiculous amount of money.

32
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:02,460
You can form an LLC starting at 99 bucks.

00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:17,740

37
00:02:19,201 --> 00:02:21,600
started the desk squad podcast network.

38
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:24,690
It's how he incorporated his how
on it was originally incorporated.

39
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,990
I know many people that have used
legal zoom. It is an excellent service.

40
00:02:27,991 --> 00:02:32,610
It's very easy to use and you could
even get divorced and legal zoom.

41
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,880
I don't think it's likely you know much.

42
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,440
It's probably going to
take a lot more than that.

43
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:41,730
If you've caught yourself in the legal
entanglement in the quagmire and the

44
00:02:41,731 --> 00:02:45,870
octopus has tentacles that is divorced,

I can't recommend them enough,

48
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:58,020
especially with that a plus
from the better business bureau.

49
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,730

51
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:10,150
Fuck around. It's cube's music.
Jamie. Stefan Molyneux is here.

52
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,100
Experience,

53
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,130
gentlemen from the dark north of Canada,

54
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,820
the white north enjoying
the fabulous sun here. Well,

55
00:03:27,821 --> 00:03:31,300
it's sunny where you are too now, right?
That's all right. Staggeringly beautiful,

56
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,580
beautiful in the summertime is fantastic.

57
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:38,560
She is a seductive bitch into
summer Canada. She really
is. She's like, hey come.

58
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,970
No problem. Yeah, come on. Set up a
house, built some stuff, couple of bugs,

59
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:46,550
no biggie. And then Bam, ice vista snow
around your hot for all the tenants. Yeah.

60
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,620
I have friends that live several
hours north of Edmonton. Oh yeah.

61
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:56,040
Oh. And uh, I visited them in the spring
and it's fantastic. It's just called.

62
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:59,790
Okay. I just green and the
walleyes fishing is absolutely how,

63
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:03,460
how do you end up living a few hours?
Like did they disturb them?

64
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:07,540
I mean to me that they get cursed in
some horrifying way. But what happened?

65
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:11,860
That's a good question there from there.
Oh, they streck dodging villagers.

66
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,930
They're really nice folks. Wow. Um,
and uh, they're, they're from there.

67
00:04:16,931 --> 00:04:19,360
My friend Johnny Rivet
and Janny Rivet and uh,

68
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,510
they actually run a hunting camp up there.

69
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,710
So they do a lot of their business
up in the, in the bush, as they say,

70
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,490
Canadian Bush, but it's so beautiful up
there in the spring and summer. Oh yeah,

71
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,660
it's fantastic. And for, you know, for
a little bit in the winter, you know,

72
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:38,410
pretty sparkly and then after awhile it
just becomes this ice dungeon and you're

73
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:41,380
like, chew your way out like a
Ferritin, an upturned aquarium. Yeah.

74
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,420
That's how you really would
not good for your health,

75
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,850
like your mental health at least to be
trapped in those environments. But what,

76
00:04:47,851 --> 00:04:50,440
you know, so after, uh, after
high school I wanted to,

77
00:04:50,441 --> 00:04:55,441
college had broke and I got a job as a
gold pan or a prospect or I spent about

78
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:59,530
18 months, like fly in camps, uh,

79
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,460
looking for debt, getting soil samples,
looking for gold and stuff like that.

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,050
And Yeah, you're in a tent for, you know,
four or five months with the same people.

81
00:05:08,051 --> 00:05:11,620
And I, they were smokers too,
so I basically, it was like
this little co, you know,

82
00:05:11,621 --> 00:05:15,280
I'm up north, it's so clear.
It's so pristine. I was a
little tent sale, tent sites,

83
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:17,470
cube of smoke for six months.

84
00:05:17,471 --> 00:05:19,610
I think it's going to have permanent
health effects even now. Yeah.

85
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:23,530
That is one of the weird things about
smokers is that they're more than willing

86
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:28,120
to impose that on other people. That's
a strange thing that they don't find.

87
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:32,860
Like it would bother me if I was a
smoker and I was sitting in a box with

88
00:05:32,861 --> 00:05:36,100
somebody and just
subjecting them to my toxin.

89
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,440
I know it's minus 40
but c'mon step outside.

90
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,690
I mean how often do you go to
a pool party and say, you know,

91
00:05:40,691 --> 00:05:44,410
I don't feel like going inside to
pee so I'm just going to let it go.

92
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:44,861
You know what I mean?

93
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:48,310
There's no non piece side to that pool
and there's no nonsmoking side to a

94
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:50,890
restaurant anyway. Yeah. Smoking.

95
00:05:50,891 --> 00:05:54,310
And the other thing about smokers is
there's a lot of them that don't have any

96
00:05:54,311 --> 00:05:57,620
problem with littering and I think it
has something to do with the fact that

97
00:05:57,621 --> 00:05:58,040
they're their

98
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,030
fucking,
their body up.

99
00:05:59,031 --> 00:06:04,031
So this is like cognitive dissonance
of like there's something involved in,

100
00:06:04,251 --> 00:06:08,360
like you have to have a separation of
clarity. If you're willing to, you,

101
00:06:08,361 --> 00:06:12,020
it's your will. You're
lighting the cigarette, you're
putting it up to your lips,

102
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,540
you're sucking in poison.
And they,

103
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,020
so many of them throw their cigarettes
on the ground. So many of them,

104
00:06:18,021 --> 00:06:20,780
and I really think there's a connection
because it's very rare that you see

105
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:23,300
someone drink a soda and then
throw the cat on the ground.

106
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:27,950
But I in front of people,
you'll see someone take a
cigarette, throw the ground,

107
00:06:27,951 --> 00:06:31,700
step on it, and just walk away. Like
as if it's out of sight, out of mind.

108
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:35,660
I think it has a direct connection
to this, this connection.

109
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:39,830
You could test that, you know,
you, you could go to like
the healthiest food store,

110
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:44,530
like up the street, there's this, a
Vegan, uh, sit down food store, whatever.

111
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,160
You get a cafe,
Vegan cafe.

112
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:49,310
It'd be interesting to see if people come
out of that with the Care Kale shakes

113
00:06:49,311 --> 00:06:52,490
and just throw crap on the ground.
I bet you that almost nobody would.

114
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,620
But you know you're hanging outside some,

115
00:06:54,621 --> 00:06:58,310
you know skeevy pool hall with a bunch
of smokers and it's all that her out

116
00:06:58,311 --> 00:07:01,160
front. Yeah. Your body is the world
is all that kind of stuff. I think.

117
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:01,651
Yeah.

118
00:07:01,651 --> 00:07:06,270
It's like the one thing where like it's
really common to litter with like that's

119
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:10,230
the like if you like if you have like
survey says if you were on family feud,

120
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:14,760
most common thing to litter,
I'm on doing the old dude who's dead.

121
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:19,920
Meanwhile it's been like five guys.
Richard Dawson, Dawson Hogan's heroes,

122
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:24,540
remember? Yeah. But now it's Steve
Harvey. Yeah. It's not the same. But yeah,

123
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:27,480
I would think that that would be like the
number one thing. It's like cigarettes.

124
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,450
So you were stuck in this tent with these
dudes and they didn't have any problem

125
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:31,650
smoking in front of you in a tent

126
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,100
just nonstop. And they were
like, they weren't even like,

127
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,290
like they would like light cigarettes
off the previous cigarette.

128
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:39,260
Like I think they,

129
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:43,420
the kind of smokers who
other than sleeping had not
had a breath of fresh air in

130
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,290
about 10 years.

131
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,740
Like they hadn't had anything coming
into their lungs that wasn't tar based.

132
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,980
And I said,
I know one of them's dead now and uh,

133
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm not sure where the other one is,
but uh,

134
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:56,330
yeah, that's, if you were an alien
and you were studying human behavior,

135
00:07:56,331 --> 00:07:58,280
cigarettes would be one
of the weirdest ones.

136
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,650
One of the weirdest things
you'd have to pay attention to.

137
00:08:00,651 --> 00:08:03,740
Like how the fuck did that
take root on so many people?

138
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,781
Oh, it's a, it's a,

139
00:08:04,781 --> 00:08:08,950
it's a legitimate payback for the like
smallpox laced blankets that the early

140
00:08:08,951 --> 00:08:10,780
settlers gave the Indian.
It's like, okay, fine.

141
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:15,550
Yt you can give us a TB lice
blankets here, smoke this.
And like, Ooh, that's good.

142
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,110
Well let's get a wipe out
more of us than a view.

143
00:08:17,111 --> 00:08:19,150
But it'll take time and it'll
go with a smile on her face.

144
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:23,040
Well, I'm wondering, I don't think
they use tobacco in the same way.

145
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:25,590
I think most native
tribes that use tobacco,

146
00:08:25,591 --> 00:08:29,790
they use it like a cigar or like
a pipe or they're not inhaling it.

147
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:33,120
They just get it into their mouth.
And when you get into your mouth,

148
00:08:33,121 --> 00:08:35,320
it gets into your bloodstream,
you get the nicotine. Okay.

149
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:40,460
That's why you can get cancer
from cigars when it's more rare.

150
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,210
Even people that are like really branding

151
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:46,560
Freud in cancer cause he like,
he had like 20 cigars a day and he got,

152
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,870
I think half is cheeky in a
way with cancer and stuff like

153
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,500
to what's going on in his life.
Yeah.

154
00:08:50,501 --> 00:08:55,320
A lot of the chewers get that to those
people that keep that stuff like in

155
00:08:55,321 --> 00:08:56,030
between their lip

156
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:59,840
and gum. Weird evidence.
Yeah. But, uh, it's,

157
00:08:59,841 --> 00:09:03,280
it's not that common with pipe smokers,
pipe smokers.

158
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:08,400
That's the original way to do it. You just
sort of take in the nicotine. In fact,

159
00:09:08,401 --> 00:09:12,480
nicotine is like a part of a, a lot
of psychedelic rituals in the Amazon.

160
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,620
They below nicotine smoke that blowed
tobacco smoke on the people that are going

161
00:09:16,621 --> 00:09:20,280
through these psychedelic rituals. Yeah.
Yeah. I don't know. For whatever reason,

162
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:25,110
I don't know how the fuck we got on
this stuff, but, so, uh, I was on,

163
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:29,040
uh, Ana Kasparian show your, you're good
buddy. You're good friends. Yesterday.

164
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:29,581
And we had,

165
00:09:29,581 --> 00:09:33,930
we had some interesting conversations
and part of it was about you and um,

166
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,440
and I appreciate that. I know you
were talking just before the show.

167
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,910
I don't care what you say about me.
Just make sure you spell my name right.

168
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,490
Well that's what I was telling her
in a way. I was saying, you know,

169
00:09:41,491 --> 00:09:42,870
she was getting upset,
you know,

170
00:09:42,871 --> 00:09:46,500
the things that you had said about
what she had said and I said,

171
00:09:46,501 --> 00:09:47,870
well you got to lick.

172
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:51,720
This is a weird thing that goes on
where people make these sort of call out

173
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:52,531
videos.
You know,

174
00:09:52,531 --> 00:09:56,490
everybody likes to do a call out video
but nobody likes to call out video turned

175
00:09:56,491 --> 00:09:57,324
on them.

176
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:02,420
And what Anna did is essentially she
listened to Adam Carolla's rant about

177
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:08,760
conservatism and she made a rant about
that and then you made a rant about her

178
00:10:08,761 --> 00:10:12,960
rant and then she's pissed a, your
rant about her rant about Adam's rant.

179
00:10:12,961 --> 00:10:13,980
And I'm like,
first of all,

180
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:17,820
this is like incredibly ineffective
way to communicate. You know,

181
00:10:17,821 --> 00:10:21,060
when people like I, I, it's one of the
things that I don't like about blogs.

182
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:24,140
I think blog entries are
great in some ways, uh,

183
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:25,930
because I think it gives someone to,
uh,

184
00:10:25,931 --> 00:10:28,650
an opportunity to really
expand on their thoughts.

185
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:32,220
And you can put a lot of energy and
effort into writing something down.

186
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:36,540
Whereas I think you might be able to get
into deeper detail than you would in a

187
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:40,150
conversation where you perhaps searching
for words or trying to clarify the

188
00:10:40,151 --> 00:10:40,640
position.

189
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,710
A lot of things you need to look up and
you can't do that and necessarily in a

190
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:47,130
debate. So it's nice having a back and
forth debt when it's database, sorry,

191
00:10:47,131 --> 00:10:51,150
go ahead. But it's a massive amount
of time involved and it's, it's,

192
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,010
it doesn't give the other person the
opportunity to respond. And when you,

193
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:55,741
you do it,

194
00:10:55,741 --> 00:11:00,741
like one person goes on this long rant
describing you in very disparaging terms

195
00:11:00,811 --> 00:11:04,140
and you know, minimize is
you, and then, you know,

196
00:11:04,141 --> 00:11:08,040
you have to respond to that and then
you go that it's way better to just sit

197
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:12,250
down and talk through ideas. So
there's a lot of these ideas that, um,

198
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:15,630
you have said that are very controversial
that we're going to give you

199
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,290
opportunities. He's no way. I know,
it's crazy. And to be fair, I mean, um,

200
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:24,030
I was working on the flight down,
I was working on a response.

201
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:26,380
I was hoping to go in and talk to them.
We,

202
00:11:26,381 --> 00:11:28,980
we knew we needed them and emailed them
and said maybe we could go and have a

203
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:31,920
debate. I think that would be
interesting and fun and useful,

204
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:35,430
very important issues that
are being talked about. But,
um, we didn't hit a bank,

205
00:11:35,431 --> 00:11:38,940
so, yeah. Well, you probably pissed
her off, you know, that's what,

206
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,820
that's what I mean, if you're not
annoyed, it's not a good debate.

207
00:11:41,821 --> 00:11:46,590
That means it's not that important. Right.
I guess. Yeah. I guess, um, the, the, the,

208
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:51,960
the core of the conversation was Adam's
position on being a conservative and how

209
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,520
the term has become

210
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:58,960
a pejorative and then the term
conservative is become a negative way of

211
00:11:58,961 --> 00:12:02,290
describing a person's behavior
and a person's thoughts.

212
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:07,750
It's more like,
it seems that it's become,

213
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,940
um,
uh,

214
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:14,210
maybe like a badge of callousness or
a descriptive term of someone who's

215
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,710
insensitive or who does not
care about the underclass.

216
00:12:17,711 --> 00:12:21,100
It does not care about poverty, does not
care about poor people. And you know,

217
00:12:21,101 --> 00:12:25,750
she had this take on it and then
you had to take on her take on it.

218
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:29,050
Um, uh, you, can you consider
yourself conservative?

219
00:12:29,051 --> 00:12:32,710
You consider yourself a libertarian,
right? I'm an anarchist. An anarchist.

220
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:34,330
And what is that exactly,

221
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,210
exactly. Well, I mean, so,
and I was resistant anarchist.

222
00:12:39,211 --> 00:12:42,350
Like for me, I was 20 years,
what's called like a mineral cast.

223
00:12:42,351 --> 00:12:45,080
It came sort of out of the
objectivist iron ran school, uh,

224
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:49,170
where your government is basically
law and national defense.

225
00:12:49,171 --> 00:12:52,320
Maybe a court system, maybe that's
sort of tiny, tiny government.

226
00:12:52,321 --> 00:12:54,690
It's called the night watchman
state, which is, you know, keep,

227
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:58,560
keep other people's Mitsoff my staff and
keep their shifts out of my kidney kind

228
00:12:58,561 --> 00:13:02,730
of thing. That's, that's
the basic function of
government. And I was like, ah,

229
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,310
but it always bothered me because that's,

230
00:13:05,311 --> 00:13:07,510
that would still have to be
funded through taxation, right?

231
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:11,340
Taxation philosophically, morally
is the initiation of force, right?

232
00:13:11,341 --> 00:13:13,080
I mean it's like I have a good idea.

233
00:13:13,081 --> 00:13:15,060
You have to pay for it and
if you don't pay for it,

234
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,770
you are going to get some letters.

235
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:19,380
And if you don't pay for it still we're
going to send some people over to your

236
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,390
house and blue costumes. And if
you don't pay for, it's still,

237
00:13:21,391 --> 00:13:24,120
they're going to take you off to jail.
And so it is the initiation of force.

238
00:13:24,121 --> 00:13:26,790
And that always bothered me.
And uh,

239
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:31,110
I guess it was about a
2006, uh, I just, um,

240
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,310
I just gave up the ghost as
far as that goes. If you like,

241
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:38,220
nobody wants to go with these particular
directions. It's just principles, right?

242
00:13:38,221 --> 00:13:40,890
You have to sort of hang on your
principles no matter what, right?

243
00:13:40,891 --> 00:13:45,090
So if you're into the non initiation of
force, right? That, that self defense,

244
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,290
perfectly moral,
legitimate,

245
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:49,410
but you can't go around pop and people
in the head without provocation,

246
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,060
you can't go around
stealing people's stuff.

247
00:13:51,061 --> 00:13:55,080
So the non initiation of force and if
you accept that as a principal and if you

248
00:13:55,081 --> 00:13:58,680
try to get philosophy as close to like
the physical sciences, physical sciences,

249
00:13:58,681 --> 00:14:01,530
they don't have exceptions, you know,
they say, well, this Rockwell, but we'll,

250
00:14:01,531 --> 00:14:03,000
we'll fall this fast in,

251
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:07,890
in know Kazakhstan and this
fast in Philadelphia, I
mean this universal, right?

252
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:10,410
So if you're going to go with
the nonaggression principle,

253
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:13,170
then the concept of government,
it's um,

254
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:16,980
morally illegitimate because the
government is that group of people in a

255
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:21,900
geographical area that initiate
the use of force against others.

256
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:25,560
And some, some people agree
with it and some people don't,
but those who don't, uh,

257
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,620
do end up being on the receiving end
to force that they don't agree with it.

258
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,890
So in an anarchist state,
the,

259
00:14:30,891 --> 00:14:34,070
the idea would be that
there would be no taxes.

260
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:38,510
So how would people fund roads?
Would they voluntarily donate?

261
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:42,200
How would they fund education? How
would, how would things get done?

262
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,920
Well. Um, the first answer is I
have no idea if I, because I mean,

263
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:49,210
if you could design a future,

264
00:14:49,211 --> 00:14:51,410
then everyone should put me in
charge of everything and right.

265
00:14:51,411 --> 00:14:54,920
That wouldn't make any sense. People
build roads, government don't build roads.

266
00:14:54,921 --> 00:14:57,620
Right? And, and it's not, there's
no entity called government.

267
00:14:57,621 --> 00:15:00,740
It's like this big a morphous flag
that goes around and lays the tarmac.

268
00:15:00,741 --> 00:15:03,380
It's just people who receive money.
So I mean,

269
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:06,380
if you're going to build a bunch of
houses, you have to build a road there.

270
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:11,180
I mean, I mean, malls build parking lots,
a air, air, airport spray, build roads.

271
00:15:11,181 --> 00:15:14,090
It's not government, it's
all private. And you know,

272
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,280
I in a gps you could charge people,
you know,

273
00:15:16,281 --> 00:15:19,010
there's a private highway
up in Canada way, you know,

274
00:15:19,011 --> 00:15:21,530
they take a photo of your license
plate or if you have a transponder,

275
00:15:21,531 --> 00:15:25,130
it's even cheaper. And they just judge
you when you go on. And however, you know,

276
00:15:25,131 --> 00:15:29,090
when you go off, then they charge you for
that. So isn't that taxing you? Well, no,

277
00:15:29,091 --> 00:15:30,840
because that's volunteering

278
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:34,870
for use. Well, it's volunteering. You can
use it, but if you have to get over there,

279
00:15:34,871 --> 00:15:37,540
is there other options without paying?
Sure.

280
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,960
Those are these other roads that mean
because that will be competition, right?

281
00:15:40,961 --> 00:15:41,970
I mean hopefully,

282
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,830
well not to the point of wasteful
duplication because that would not be very

283
00:15:44,831 --> 00:15:45,760
efficient economically.

284
00:15:45,761 --> 00:15:48,190
And if there's a hundred rows
going to the exact same direction,

285
00:15:48,191 --> 00:15:51,070
I'll say my side one costs
a dollar a lot competition.

286
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,770
I haven't seen a tree in
four days or I'd be like,

287
00:15:53,771 --> 00:15:57,070
you know the movie Brazil where they have
those billboards maybe on either side.

288
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:01,390
So I think you pretty open in the
idea that you don't have a solution,

289
00:16:01,391 --> 00:16:04,720
but what you're doing is saying that
the current problem is unacceptable.

290
00:16:04,721 --> 00:16:08,880
Is that a fair way of assessing
your, your take on current? Yeah.

291
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,040
I mean technically it's not good
philosophy to have a universal caught the

292
00:16:16,031 --> 00:16:16,870
nonaggression principle.

293
00:16:16,871 --> 00:16:20,620
But you and I and this fine fellow here
in the listeners, we all accept, right?

294
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:24,220
We all here voluntarily. You don't
force anyone to come to your shows.

295
00:16:24,221 --> 00:16:25,780
I didn't force anyone
to listen to what I do.

296
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,050
So we all accept that at a personal level.
And that's what we teach our kids,

297
00:16:29,051 --> 00:16:31,840
right? Yeah. Don't hit, don't take
other people's stuff. Don't push.

298
00:16:31,841 --> 00:16:35,230
Do you know that kind of stuff.
And so if we're going to have these rules,

299
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,080
you know, much like science, like
how far can we push these rules?

300
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,040
Now I think that it's kind of wrong
to say, well, we have these rules,

301
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:46,210
but right up to here will completely
abandon them and go to the opposite. Um,

302
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,880
or at least we need to acknowledge
that it's what's going on in society.

303
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,600
So if we say that the nonaggression
principle is the way that we should live,

304
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,970
well the government is just people.
How do they get this?

305
00:16:54,971 --> 00:16:58,120
Get Out of jail free card where they can
do stuff that is specifically illegal

306
00:16:58,121 --> 00:16:59,770
for the private citizens,
like print money,

307
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:03,340
like take out debts on behalf of other
people and you and I can't do that.

308
00:17:03,341 --> 00:17:07,870
I can't go buy a car and send you the
bill. And they can invade countries.

309
00:17:07,871 --> 00:17:11,980
They can force people to pay for things
so they can incarcerate huge numbers of

310
00:17:11,981 --> 00:17:15,880
people. Largely on a whim. They can tell
people who are doing things like drugs,

311
00:17:15,881 --> 00:17:19,060
which is a purely voluntary form
of enjoyment and stuff. Medication,

312
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,540
they can throw them in jail. I
can't do that. You can't do that.

313
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,980
If I'm on a pay for my kids' education,

314
00:17:23,981 --> 00:17:26,770
I don't get to walk up and down the
street with a machete saying pay or die.

315
00:17:26,771 --> 00:17:28,840
I mean, but this is the way
that we've set up or the wave.

316
00:17:28,841 --> 00:17:31,420
You've inherited society. Sorry, I
don't want to go on to big Aranda. No,

317
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:34,340
but it's a good rent.
It's a good point as well.

318
00:17:34,341 --> 00:17:38,660
The idea that it's society has
been sort of inherited, you know,

319
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:43,040
that we have sort of been born into
this system that is really not that well

320
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:47,630
engineered and has massive flaws in
it. And uh, it's a very good point.

321
00:17:47,631 --> 00:17:51,190
When you talk about the
reinforce the um, uh, the,

322
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,890
the taxes,

323
00:17:52,891 --> 00:17:57,570
like enforcing tax laws that you can
lock people in jail for owing money.

324
00:17:57,571 --> 00:18:02,100
It's one of the only times where someone
gets locked in a cage because they owe

325
00:18:02,101 --> 00:18:04,430
money even if you choose
to pay that money. Yeah.

326
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,500
Wesley snipes is a perfect example.

327
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:11,520
The actor chose to not pay his
taxes based on an erroneous belief.

328
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,120
He had this belief that
the constitution does not,

329
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:19,020
does not force you to pay taxes and
that it's a misunderstanding that if you

330
00:18:19,021 --> 00:18:21,900
fight it in court, you would, when
he had these terrible advisors.

331
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,610
So he decided to not pay taxes for a long
time and he made a really large sum of

332
00:18:26,611 --> 00:18:30,000
money.
And that is when they go after you,

333
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:33,720
when you're one of those people
that is already the privileged few,

334
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:37,530
making an exorbitant amount of money and
then you step up and say you don't have

335
00:18:37,531 --> 00:18:41,610
to pay taxes and you do it blatantly
didn't even matter if he tried to pay the

336
00:18:41,611 --> 00:18:42,061
money back,

337
00:18:42,061 --> 00:18:44,550
they were going to lock him in jail
no matter what it felt like this is,

338
00:18:44,551 --> 00:18:49,100
it's not, it's a crime and it's the only
time it's a crime to owe money. You know,

339
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:51,900
every other time it's like we
have a debt and you know what,

340
00:18:51,901 --> 00:18:53,520
you have to pay that debt off. Like, say,

341
00:18:53,521 --> 00:18:58,170
if I loaned you 100 bucks and we went to
court and the court found out that you

342
00:18:58,171 --> 00:19:00,150
didn't pay me that a hundred bucks,
you don't go to jail,

343
00:19:00,151 --> 00:19:03,120
you just have to pay me 100 bucks.
But if you're the government 100 bucks,

344
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,490
they have the option
to lock you in a cage.

345
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:10,070
And that to me is sort of akin to
shitty parenting. You know, like you're,

346
00:19:10,071 --> 00:19:12,770
you're a, a strong believer in, uh,

347
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,570
not hitting kids and
not screaming at them.

348
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,500
And if you're tired and you're dumb
and your kid doesn't want to listen,

349
00:19:19,501 --> 00:19:23,850
one of the best ways to get them to
listen to you is violent force or fear.

350
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:28,800
Those are the best ways. And it's, uh,
it's been a huge problem throughout.

351
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,080
You know, it's, it's, as far
as recorded history, I mean,

352
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:35,460
people have been beating their kids.
People have been yelling at their kids,

353
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:37,860
people who've actually even defended it.
You know?

354
00:19:37,861 --> 00:19:42,861
And I think that this lazy use of force
is very similar to what the government

355
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:44,790
does. It's almost like they
feel like their hands are tied.

356
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,130
There's 350 million people
they have to get money from.

357
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,670
What's the best way to do it? Scare
the fuck out of him. The block,

358
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,740
that actor in jail, that Wesley
Snipes, he put him in a cage.

359
00:19:52,741 --> 00:19:55,920
Make an example out of him and
anybody else that steps out of line,

360
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,300
lock them in cage too.

361
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:00,700
Lauren Hill to Lauren Hill,
the food just solo artist.

362
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,140
Fantastic singer and yeah,
she's serenading like
James Brown and the in the,

363
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,050
and the echoing holes of
the incarceration station

364
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,770
talks about that either she didn't never
heard anybody, she didn't do anything.

365
00:20:11,771 --> 00:20:13,920
She's got some wacky ideas I've
ever heard that broad talk.

366
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:17,180
Ooh,
well if you're pretty and talented,

367
00:20:17,181 --> 00:20:19,580
sometimes people don't step up to say.

368
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:24,230
But the other thing too is that there
are things that I find extremely morally

369
00:20:24,231 --> 00:20:28,980
objectionable, like, like at a skin
crawling, visceral base of the spine,

370
00:20:28,981 --> 00:20:30,620
the electrification kind of feeling like,

371
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:35,330
I hate the imperialism of a
lot of the western countries,

372
00:20:35,331 --> 00:20:37,910
particularly in America right there,
the invasions of Iraq and, and all that.

373
00:20:37,911 --> 00:20:41,210
I just, I find that stuff unbelievably
reprehensible. And as you can see,

374
00:20:41,211 --> 00:20:45,620
the entire society has disintegrated.
Now. I hate the war on drugs.

375
00:20:45,621 --> 00:20:49,780
I really, I mean at a very
fundamental level, I think, um,

376
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:52,930
it is absolutely abhorrent and
destructive. You know, we saw some of the,

377
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:55,540
I think the shake out of that
and Ferguson, Missouri recently,

378
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,820
which I think a war on drugs
had a lot to do with that stuff.

379
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:01,300
And the fact that I'm forced to,
to fund this,

380
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:06,550
it goes violently against my
conscience and I feel very helpless to,

381
00:21:06,551 --> 00:21:07,211
um,
to,

382
00:21:07,211 --> 00:21:12,211
to not support the things that I find
incredibly objectionable and incredibly

383
00:21:12,311 --> 00:21:16,840
destructive, uh, to, uh, to particularly
minorities is unbelievably horrendous.

384
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,730
And I'd like to have the right to say no,

385
00:21:18,731 --> 00:21:21,250
I really would like to have the right
to say no to that kind of stuff.

386
00:21:21,251 --> 00:21:21,851
There's lots,
I mean,

387
00:21:21,851 --> 00:21:24,760
I do charitable work and I give away
my shows for free and I'm very happy to

388
00:21:24,761 --> 00:21:27,820
share whatever goodies I've accumulated
in life with people who are less

389
00:21:27,821 --> 00:21:28,654
fortunate or needy.

390
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:34,320
But there's so much that goes on in the
world that governments do that I find

391
00:21:34,421 --> 00:21:35,500
just so horrendous.

392
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:40,660
And I would really like none of
the above as one of the options.

393
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:45,810
Yeah. None of the above. But how
do these things get funded then?

394
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,610
How would they fund war? How would they
fund, you know, that would be very tricky.

395
00:21:50,611 --> 00:21:53,820
They would have to get creative. Yeah.
I was listening to hardcore history.

396
00:21:53,821 --> 00:21:56,340
You ever listen to hardcore history,
Dan Collins? Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah.

397
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:59,730
We've done some shows together. Yeah,
he's fantastic show. I really love it.

398
00:21:59,731 --> 00:22:04,650
And he's got a new episode and it's about
World War One and it goes into great

399
00:22:04,651 --> 00:22:08,870
detail about the massive
losses that were just,

400
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:14,090
just racking the French forces and the
the German artillery and all this shit

401
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:20,040
that was going on and how it was becoming
increasingly difficult to get people

402
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:22,830
to sign up for the war,
especially with English.

403
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:25,200
The English folks trying
to get them to sign up,

404
00:22:25,201 --> 00:22:28,410
like had gotten to the point
where he had lost 500,000 people,

405
00:22:28,411 --> 00:22:33,100
500,000 casualties in a short
period of time. And you know it,

406
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:37,020
it gets to that point where
people aren't buying it anymore.

407
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:41,310
Like in the beginning it was easy to
sort of coerce people into doing it by,

408
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:46,140
he was actually going into depth about
people with shame. People like women,

409
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:47,970
like pretty white feathers. Yeah, yeah.

410
00:22:47,971 --> 00:22:52,080
They would put a white feather
on you if you weren't in uniform.

411
00:22:52,081 --> 00:22:54,120
If you weren't a military person,
you weren't,

412
00:22:54,121 --> 00:22:56,220
you were a coward and you were
considered to be a coward.

413
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,060
And it was so much so that they had
to kind of figure out a way not to,

414
00:23:00,061 --> 00:23:02,490
because there were many people that are
involved in the war effort that weren't

415
00:23:02,491 --> 00:23:02,971
soldiers,

416
00:23:02,971 --> 00:23:05,850
that people that were building munitions
and people that were making guns and

417
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:10,080
people that were involved in all sorts
of different levels of government that

418
00:23:10,081 --> 00:23:12,100
weren't cowards in their eyes.
But you know,

419
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,100
they were getting attack the
same way everybody else was.

420
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:18,530
It was sort of like a feeding frenzy and
it's, it's, it's interesting to see, uh,

421
00:23:18,531 --> 00:23:22,890
especially when you're talking about the
early 19 hundreds of the essentially a

422
00:23:22,891 --> 00:23:24,990
hundred years ago,
the talking about this,

423
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:30,330
the use of manipulation of trying
to get people to go along with war,

424
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,020
especially back then when there was so
much less information available to the

425
00:23:34,021 --> 00:23:35,550
average person,
whereas today,

426
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:39,270
trying to get someone to go along
with wars far more difficult,

427
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,010
far more problematic.

428
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:45,860
Well, and this is terrible, um, power
that the government has to money at will,

429
00:23:45,861 --> 00:23:46,070
which

430
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,620
the first World War Lashley and gendered
in the first World War could not have

431
00:23:48,621 --> 00:23:51,650
been fought on the gold reserves
that the country has had at the time.

432
00:23:51,651 --> 00:23:53,300
It would have been over
in six to 12 months.

433
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,260
And so right now they can just create
this money out of thin air. Right.

434
00:23:57,261 --> 00:24:00,200
So I mean the, the war in Iraq
did not come with equivalent.

435
00:24:00,201 --> 00:24:03,230
The war on terror did not
come with equivalent massive
tax increases to pay for

436
00:24:03,231 --> 00:24:06,410
it cause they just printed all this
money and this messed up the economy.

437
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:10,190
It was inefficient contribution to the
housing crash and all of the mass that's

438
00:24:10,191 --> 00:24:13,370
gone ever since then. And
so for me, it's like, well,

439
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:17,060
wouldn't this weight make war more
difficult if you had sort of privatized a

440
00:24:17,061 --> 00:24:22,040
defense systems? It's like, yes, yes,
yes. That's what we want. Let's make more,

441
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:26,240
more difficult to, to embark on and
pursue and make sure that it's defensive.

442
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,270
Aggressive was a very expensive defensive
wards are relatively cheap. I mean,

443
00:24:29,271 --> 00:24:34,190
look at what defeated in a sense,
the American military in Iraq,

444
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:35,900
I mean,
what was the cost?

445
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,920
How much did America spend versus how
much did the people defending themselves

446
00:24:39,921 --> 00:24:42,110
spent a look at, uh, a Vietnam,

447
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:46,010
what people were defending themselves and
around the inceptions essentially as a

448
00:24:46,011 --> 00:24:49,370
blood bath though, but, and just,
I'm terms of dollar cost, right?

449
00:24:49,371 --> 00:24:51,830
So you can bring down a $20 million plane,

450
00:24:51,831 --> 00:24:54,740
but the $20,000 Stinger missile
attacking is very expensive.

451
00:24:54,741 --> 00:24:59,150
Defending is very cheap. But look at how
poor a job they did a defending, I mean,

452
00:24:59,151 --> 00:25:01,130
a million civilians were wiped out.

453
00:25:01,131 --> 00:25:03,110
Their entire country was
essentially taken over.

454
00:25:03,111 --> 00:25:07,490
The only reason why they don't the United
States is now full power of Iraq is

455
00:25:07,491 --> 00:25:09,530
because that was never the
objective in the first place.

456
00:25:09,531 --> 00:25:11,800
And because we abandoned
it and pulled out, right,

457
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:15,020
I mean their defense of the military,

458
00:25:15,021 --> 00:25:17,980
the United States military
was woefully ineffective.

459
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:21,650
So like saying that it's inexpensive,
it's kind of silly. I don't know.

460
00:25:21,651 --> 00:25:24,200
I just want to 10 credibly in effective.
Well,

461
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:29,000
but the goal again is a stated goal of
the leaders of al Qaeda was to provoke

462
00:25:29,001 --> 00:25:33,980
America into the same kind of war that
Russia got into in Afghanistan that broke

463
00:25:33,981 --> 00:25:35,900
the Russian economy and
collapsed their empire.

464
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:40,760
It was to get America to start waging
war in a way that was much more costly to

465
00:25:40,761 --> 00:25:42,920
the Americans. I mean, human
side, I agree with you.

466
00:25:42,921 --> 00:25:46,250
I mean a rack is just a complete mess and,
and not just physical,

467
00:25:46,251 --> 00:25:49,010
but genetic damage from all of
these depleted uranium shells.

468
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:52,610
They've wiped out the genetics of
an entire population. Uh, birth,

469
00:25:52,611 --> 00:25:55,370
birth defects and leukemia.
And I mean, it's unbel.

470
00:25:55,371 --> 00:25:59,510
It's literally like hell since
Desert Storm since the first year,

471
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:01,910
since the first one.
But even more so I think in the second,

472
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:05,330
but from a pure dollars
and cents standpoint,

473
00:26:05,331 --> 00:26:09,410
their goal was get America into these
unwinnable wars against these insurgents

474
00:26:09,411 --> 00:26:13,430
because I mean this is what the CIA taught
to be enlightened in the 80s with the

475
00:26:13,431 --> 00:26:14,500
Mujahideen was gold,
gold.

476
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,270
Get the Russians to come in and then just
keep pinging them off and picking them

477
00:26:17,271 --> 00:26:19,160
off and picking them
off until they go broke.

478
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:21,710
What we're talking about two completely
different locations now we're talking

479
00:26:21,711 --> 00:26:23,180
about Iraq and Afghanistan,

480
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:25,550
two completely different
environments and Afghanistan.

481
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:30,410
One of the reasons why it's almost an
entirely unwinnable war is because of the

482
00:26:30,411 --> 00:26:31,610
terrain.
I mean,

483
00:26:31,611 --> 00:26:36,110
Afghanistan is like trying
to fight a battle in the
rocky mountains. It's insane.

484
00:26:36,111 --> 00:26:39,850
Yeah. I mean if you look at the terrain
that these people were involved with it,

485
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:42,720
it's just crazy.
It's mountains and there's no cities.

486
00:26:42,721 --> 00:26:45,510
You have war lords that our own,
you know,

487
00:26:45,511 --> 00:26:50,460
these particular parcels of land and it's,
it's a crazy,

488
00:26:50,461 --> 00:26:54,030
crazy place. The idea of taking
over Afghanistan. I mean,

489
00:26:54,031 --> 00:26:58,490
you would literally have to comb the
mountain side and pull everybody out and,

490
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:02,370
and camp them or something. I mean,
there's no way you can't, there's no,

491
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,390
there's no cities to take over.
You know,

492
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:09,510
it's a completely unwinnable
geographic situation. But Iraq,

493
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:13,140
totally different story. I mean,
Iraq to death, it was cities. Yeah,

494
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:15,930
for the most part. Right. So you've got
a lot of places you can take over, but,

495
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:16,591
but we,

496
00:27:16,591 --> 00:27:21,591
if we were invaded like that in
this anarchist version of society,

497
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,510
what would you do? I mean, you,

498
00:27:24,511 --> 00:27:28,170
you obviously could enforce your version
of society on other people if you have

499
00:27:28,171 --> 00:27:28,921
dictatorships,

500
00:27:28,921 --> 00:27:33,270
like say North Korea or something along
those lines that has a strong military

501
00:27:33,271 --> 00:27:37,320
power and decided to invade. What are
you doing? An anarchist society? I mean,

502
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:40,400
that's, you know, let's
say you have, you have a,

503
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:45,210
an advocate society and next all you have
some status society. Right? Okay. I mean,

504
00:27:45,211 --> 00:27:48,600
there's a couple of answers,
which you know, who knows, right?

505
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:53,610
But one of the answers is that invading
an anarchist country is pretty tough

506
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,170
because what are you going to take over?

507
00:27:55,171 --> 00:27:57,870
So if you look at countries
that invade other countries,

508
00:27:57,871 --> 00:28:02,250
they they take over the tax system.
Natural Resources. Well, to some degree,

509
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:06,210
one of the main reasons why we in vain
countries, it's like if the hugest reason,

510
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:10,150
well I'm not sure if, I mean that doesn't
really explain much about Afghanistan,

511
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:13,200
although there are some arguments
that massive amounts of minerals,

512
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:16,980
trillions of dollars in minerals, but
you can get that trade, right? I mean,

513
00:28:16,981 --> 00:28:19,800
you don't have to go and invade and why
would you do that when you can just take

514
00:28:19,801 --> 00:28:21,390
it?
If you have no cities,

515
00:28:21,391 --> 00:28:25,050
you have cobble and then you have like
a bunch of dudes with goats and you go,

516
00:28:25,051 --> 00:28:27,670
yeah, I think we're going to just go
over there and take your shit. Right.

517
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,920
Why would you do that when you're this
giant military force and you also make

518
00:28:31,921 --> 00:28:33,540
money in invading,
right?

519
00:28:33,541 --> 00:28:38,541
Because the people that are contractors
that get government funds to go over

520
00:28:38,731 --> 00:28:42,600
there and spend money on tanks and
planes and it's a huge business.

521
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,900
The business of the military
industrial complex cannot be denied.

522
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:49,470
But he was a mass made money because
I know that there's the theory have.

523
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:53,280
So who's, who's made
money from the invasion of
Afghanistan? Of all Halliburton,

524
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:56,310
Halliburton, no, no, that's mass amounts
of money. But in terms of the minerals,

525
00:28:56,311 --> 00:28:59,040
like in terms of getting the minerals,
because I know that they're for sure, yes,

526
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,140
but who's actually making money from it?
Well,

527
00:29:01,141 --> 00:29:05,190
they haven't yet because they have to
figure out a way to extract them. Lithium,

528
00:29:05,191 --> 00:29:09,720
there's a lot of minerals that we need
for Tesla cars and cell phones and all

529
00:29:09,721 --> 00:29:13,770
the battery operated things that we use.
For the most part, we use lithium ion.

530
00:29:13,771 --> 00:29:16,860
That's the current technology and the
trillions of dollars worth of that stuff

531
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:20,780
in Afghanistan when the biggest supplies
of it in the world. Right. So. Okay,

532
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:24,660
so they located it and it's like
even if it hasn't been extracted,

533
00:29:24,661 --> 00:29:27,760
it's like we're not going to let anybody
else go over and control that area

534
00:29:27,761 --> 00:29:30,510
because you're talking about massive,

535
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:33,540
massive amounts of money and resources.
Well,

536
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:37,120
it sort of remains to be seen because if
the argument is why they wouldn't have

537
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:39,750
had the resources, they've been
in there for what, 12 years now,

538
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,370
and if they still haven't extracted
the resources, that argument,

539
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:45,700
I think it's much more around Halliburton
and the military industrial complex,

540
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:49,270
making a huge amount of money by basically
picking the pockets of the unborn for

541
00:29:49,271 --> 00:29:51,490
inflation and debt.
So I think that's much more immediate.

542
00:29:51,491 --> 00:29:54,160
I think that's like a 12 or 15
year plan to get the resources.

543
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,320
I think that's maybe something
that's in the back pocket,

544
00:29:56,321 --> 00:29:59,550
but I think they really make money off
the Fed. That's Fed Brinton, right?

545
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:03,190
Yeah. That's certainly the current way
that they're making money, but it's,

546
00:30:03,191 --> 00:30:06,250
I don't think it's an either or.
I think without a doubt there's,

547
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:10,690
there's plans on trying to figure
out how to get those resources.

548
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,320
But I think that's the main reason
why people invade countries.

549
00:30:14,321 --> 00:30:15,430
It's natural resources.

550
00:30:15,431 --> 00:30:19,240
They don't invade because they want to
control the population for no reason and

551
00:30:19,241 --> 00:30:20,230
turn them into slaves.

552
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:24,010
They invade because they need
something that the other people have.

553
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,080
Okay. So, I mean it Germany,

554
00:30:27,081 --> 00:30:30,030
but generally invade countries that when
they invaded Czechoslovakia and Austria

555
00:30:30,031 --> 00:30:30,960
and France and so on,

556
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:34,350
they invaded and took over the tax base
so that they got all the tax money and

557
00:30:34,351 --> 00:30:37,260
they've got the gold and all that.
So if there's no tax structure,

558
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:41,070
then it's less profitable to
invade and take over a country.

559
00:30:41,071 --> 00:30:44,250
That's not a final argument.
That's sort of one, one thing.

560
00:30:44,251 --> 00:30:46,470
It's sort of like if you've got two areas,
uh,

561
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:49,230
that you're thinking of taking over one
of them as a farm and the other one is

562
00:30:49,231 --> 00:30:52,710
just a forest with nothing there you'd
want to take over the farm because

563
00:30:52,711 --> 00:30:55,890
everyone's already domesticated and
there's already a system of production so

564
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:59,700
that like the farm is like the government
system where the, the human livestock,

565
00:30:59,701 --> 00:31:01,440
the tax lifestyle already domesticated,

566
00:31:01,441 --> 00:31:04,620
the whole system of payment is all set
up and so on. So it's more profitable.

567
00:31:04,621 --> 00:31:09,180
Usually if you want to just get money
and resources to go and into an existing

568
00:31:09,181 --> 00:31:13,260
country with the state to go into a
country without a state, it's, it's tough.

569
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:14,041
You can still do it,

570
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:18,450
but you don't have that farm domestication
production system all set up for you

571
00:31:18,451 --> 00:31:19,284
to take over.

572
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:23,160
The second thing is that new nuclear
weapons generally mean you don't get

573
00:31:23,161 --> 00:31:28,020
invaded, right? I mean this, why did
Europe suddenly find Kumbaya? You know,

574
00:31:28,021 --> 00:31:32,470
let's hold hands and be peaceful after
Ken billion years of warfare because they

575
00:31:32,471 --> 00:31:34,500
got nuclear weapons and the
Post Second World War period,

576
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:38,150
and with nuclear weapons, suddenly it's
like blessed are the Peacemakers. So most,

577
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,170
you know, if you get
a couple of nukes, uh,

578
00:31:40,171 --> 00:31:44,430
then you're most likely not going to be
in the how those new skid fund they get

579
00:31:44,431 --> 00:31:48,780
funded by still will pay
taxes. I know, isn't it?

580
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:51,270
But this is the thing,
right? I mean, because,

581
00:31:51,271 --> 00:31:53,670
and this is what I was making
the beef fat with Anna as well.

582
00:31:53,671 --> 00:31:56,910
This is something needs
to be done going to say,

583
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,320
therefore we need a coercive
redistributionist. Yx State is,

584
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,620
to me, sort of similar to saying, well,
where do we come from? What God made us?

585
00:32:04,621 --> 00:32:07,140
It's not really much of
an answer, right? So, yes,

586
00:32:07,141 --> 00:32:10,860
you'll need nukes now running a nuke
for a population of any kind of size,

587
00:32:10,861 --> 00:32:13,050
having a couple of nukes will
cost you like five bucks a year,

588
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,890
10 bucks a year for everyone to chip in.
People will generally do that.

589
00:32:16,891 --> 00:32:20,340
People tip waiters, right? I mean, you've
worked in nightclubs. The waiters. Dot.

590
00:32:20,341 --> 00:32:21,630
Starving and Mac ate it.
Right.

591
00:32:21,631 --> 00:32:25,710
So people will generally pay for things
that can be shown, have a value to them.

592
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:28,630
But aren't you?
I mean the nonviolent principal,

593
00:32:28,631 --> 00:32:32,590
aren't you the person that doesn't
advocate violence doesn't want war

594
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:35,300
on initiation?
Self defense is different.

595
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:38,820
Okay, so you were in favor of using
nuclear weapons for self defense.

596
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,540
I think it's one possibility. It's one
possibility. Execution of nuclear weapons.

597
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:46,310
I would absolutely view that
as a last resort for sure.

598
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,740
Because of course there's so many
innocence who get caught up in that.

599
00:32:48,741 --> 00:32:50,240
Let me give you another
couple of possibilities.

600
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:54,410
There are weapons you can create that
are targeted to people specific DNA.

601
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:54,951
In other words,

602
00:32:54,951 --> 00:32:59,210
you can release an illness that only
will kill somebody specific DNA. Oh,

603
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:03,320
that sounds like a fucking dream. That
doesn't seem like it would be possible.

604
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:06,650
I'm telling you, I'm telling you I've
been done. Is that a proof of concept?

605
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,390
Does that,
I'm not sure if it's been done,

606
00:33:08,391 --> 00:33:11,630
but there's some are certainly ways of
targeting from the start of a movie where

607
00:33:11,631 --> 00:33:15,270
shit gets terribly out of control
and then it's mad max well,

608
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:19,160
but whether or not right when you
have a bunch of people who all have

609
00:33:19,161 --> 00:33:20,420
governments invading each other,

610
00:33:20,421 --> 00:33:22,490
there's kind of an unwritten
rule which says don't tag it,

611
00:33:22,491 --> 00:33:25,770
the leaders because they don't want
that to happen. On the other hand, uh,

612
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,970
an anarchic societies,
perfectly comfortable targeting leaders,

613
00:33:28,971 --> 00:33:30,800
which would really be
the best thing to do.

614
00:33:30,801 --> 00:33:34,760
I would much rather target a leader and
disabled that person or even kill them

615
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:38,700
if that leader was initiating a
aggression against a free society. Uh,

616
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,200
that to me would be the way to go and
that would be a significant disincentive.

617
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,970
That seems like,
that sounds like a beautiful idea,

618
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,610
but that seems cool daily. I
mean, past the first hurdle. Yeah.

619
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:54,560
But doesn't that seem highly unlikely
that anybody would be able to engineer

620
00:33:54,561 --> 00:33:59,140
genetic disease that's going to
cause piece that seems like, I mean,

621
00:33:59,141 --> 00:34:01,280
if that's the way to go about doing this,

622
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:05,030
I mean is that the only way if you can
target the leaders of people who are

623
00:34:05,031 --> 00:34:08,320
going to invade you, that just seems to
me like the best sense, right? I mean why,

624
00:34:08,321 --> 00:34:08,670
why,

625
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:12,800
why all the while all the surfs killing
each other in France in the first world

626
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:16,220
war. It's the leaders who started at all
whom, you know, that old pink Floyd sign,

627
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:19,880
you know, a general sat by the lines
on the map move from side to side.

628
00:34:19,881 --> 00:34:23,060
I mean it's the general suicide in
the war. Well, it's a different time.

629
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:26,150
You know that back then it's completely
different because the only way you were

630
00:34:26,151 --> 00:34:30,920
getting information was through
newspapers and we weren't able to have

631
00:34:30,921 --> 00:34:33,800
independent journalists giving you
the full facts of the situation.

632
00:34:33,801 --> 00:34:37,220
Like we're able to today.
But if you did do that,

633
00:34:37,221 --> 00:34:38,810
you create a power vacuum.

634
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:41,960
One of the things that
people don't understand about
what's going on in Chicago.

635
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:44,780
Everyone's like,
why is there so much violence in Chicago?

636
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:49,040
I talked to a cop when I was in Chicago
and he gave me a unique point of view

637
00:34:49,041 --> 00:34:50,270
and what he said was,

638
00:34:50,271 --> 00:34:53,870
what happened is they arrested
some of the big Dame drug dealers.

639
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:56,990
They arrested some of the top dogs.
When they arrested these guys,

640
00:34:56,991 --> 00:35:00,320
they created a power vacuum and boom.
That's what's going on.

641
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:03,010
That's also what we see going on
in the Middle East with Isis. Yeah.

642
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,450
With that is is we see a power vacuum.

643
00:35:05,451 --> 00:35:09,110
The United States is pulling out of Iraq
and then we're being forced to go back

644
00:35:09,111 --> 00:35:10,580
in there now and try to deal with this.

645
00:35:10,581 --> 00:35:15,530
That was that journalist that was just
beheaded. Fucking crazy shit going on.

646
00:35:15,531 --> 00:35:18,470
These guys, the isis videos that
they're putting out on youtube,

647
00:35:18,471 --> 00:35:22,400
it's like they're taking extremism
to a completely new level.

648
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:27,260
They're taking violence and they're taking
the shockingness of it. All the, the,

649
00:35:27,261 --> 00:35:30,530
the, the fear tactics. They're
taking it to a whole new level,

650
00:35:30,531 --> 00:35:34,100
putting these execution videos on
youtube. Brutal, brutal videos.

651
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:38,040
I don't know how they're on youtube got
taken down right away. But they weren't

652
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,191
though.

653
00:35:38,191 --> 00:35:40,890
There was over a hundred thousand views
in a bit up for a couple of months.

654
00:35:40,891 --> 00:35:45,360
It's one that I watched. Yeah, it
had been up for at least 30 days.

655
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,680
I know that for a fact.

656
00:35:46,681 --> 00:35:50,940
And it was over a hundred thousand views
and it was brutal. Was Execution Style.

657
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:53,280
There was shooting these guys that were
on the ground and they cut this guy's

658
00:35:53,281 --> 00:35:56,940
head off while he was alive. That's
a power vacuum. I mean that's,

659
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:59,940
that's the result of a power vacuum
from the United States pulling out.

660
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,760
I don't know. I mean, I think this,

661
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,060
this idea of this anarchistic
society is interesting.

662
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,610
It's an interesting alternative.
It's certainly, look,

663
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,100
the society that we have
right now is massive flaws.

664
00:36:11,101 --> 00:36:14,340
It's certainly open for
improvement, but I dunno. Uhm,

665
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:18,810
I dunno how you fight off bad
guys, you know, I just don't know.

666
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,370
Well, but we had a state,
but, but that is, is, um,

667
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:27,490
to not view set and aspects of the
state as the bad guys. Right. So, uh,

668
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,190
to me,

669
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:32,000
I think there's better ways to protect
my property than giving people the right

670
00:36:32,001 --> 00:36:34,160
to take half of it away at gunpoint.
You know,

671
00:36:34,161 --> 00:36:36,260
that three with you seem sort of logical.
I'm,

672
00:36:36,261 --> 00:36:37,670
and I don't know how it's going to go,

673
00:36:37,671 --> 00:36:39,920
but let me give you an analogy and
I've used this before and I'll,

674
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:40,761
I'll keep it brief,

675
00:36:40,761 --> 00:36:45,761
but we've learned how to do without evil
and problematic institutions before.

676
00:36:46,761 --> 00:36:48,560
I mean the institution
of slavery obviously was,

677
00:36:48,561 --> 00:36:52,430
was central throughout human history
all throughout the world, uh,

678
00:36:52,431 --> 00:36:55,580
for all of human history that
has ever been known or recorded.

679
00:36:55,581 --> 00:36:56,780
So like 100,000 years,

680
00:36:56,781 --> 00:37:01,760
basically people had slaves and then
there was a crazy bunch of people who came

681
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:04,700
along and said this stuff
is wrong and bad and so on.

682
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:07,850
And people spent a lot of time and
energy and money to end slavery.

683
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:13,060
And now we have, I think, some fantastic
benefits from that. You know, we have, um,

684
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,110
I mean obviously a more moral society,

685
00:37:15,111 --> 00:37:18,320
we have a better economic efficiency
and all that kind of slaves was very

686
00:37:18,321 --> 00:37:21,740
inefficient. So we do end to subjugation
of women. And things like that.

687
00:37:21,741 --> 00:37:25,130
Like there's things where we've said,
or serfdom or or,

688
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,950
or bondage share for, um, for debt.

689
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:31,340
There's things that we've done away with
that haven't created necessarily the

690
00:37:31,341 --> 00:37:32,450
same kind of power vacuum.

691
00:37:32,451 --> 00:37:34,640
Like when we get away with
things from a moral standpoint,

692
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:36,170
they usually isn't a power vacuum.

693
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:39,170
If there's some decapitation of
power without principles behind it,

694
00:37:39,171 --> 00:37:41,570
then people ration to to fix it.

695
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:46,100
But I think we're not done yet as a
species. I think we have more to go.

696
00:37:46,101 --> 00:37:48,800
And I think the question of the state
is one that we really need to examine.

697
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:52,550
So if you were to say to somebody and
like the 17th century, you say, okay,

698
00:37:52,551 --> 00:37:53,384
wait a second.

699
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:58,280
Almost like basically all agricultural
productivity is down by slaves.

700
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,240
So if you get rid of slaves,
what's going to happen? Right.

701
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:04,610
And if I were to say to you,
Oh man, I got a great idea,

702
00:38:04,611 --> 00:38:05,444
here's how it's going to work.

703
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:10,340
We're going to have these giant robots
that goes sweeping through the fields,

704
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:14,090
which have the energy of a
thousand horses and they rush,

705
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:19,230
they run on the crushed tree juice
from the dinosaur era and you'd say,

706
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:24,350
what the hell are you talking about?
That's impossible. It makes no sense.

707
00:38:24,351 --> 00:38:27,650
It could never happen, but that is what
happened. We got these giant combine,

708
00:38:27,651 --> 00:38:31,220
half assist that run on gasoline and
oil that comes out of crushed trees from

709
00:38:31,221 --> 00:38:32,450
hundreds of millions of years ago.

710
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:37,510
So what happens when you get rid of
an immoral institution is ungraspable.

711
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:39,820
And we don't know you used
to be because you'd say what?

712
00:38:39,821 --> 00:38:41,980
Look 80% of people that
are involved in farming.

713
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:44,860
So if you're going to get rid of slaves,
first of all,

714
00:38:44,861 --> 00:38:47,470
nobody's going to pick the crops because
it's unpleasant work or whatever.

715
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:51,190
And 80% of people will, you know,
40% of them will be out of a job.

716
00:38:51,191 --> 00:38:54,430
But now like 2% of people that are
involved in farming because we got rid of

717
00:38:54,431 --> 00:38:57,760
slavery and it became much more efficient
to invest in machinery rather than

718
00:38:57,761 --> 00:39:00,370
maintain the value of slaves
by relying on manual labor.

719
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:04,300
So what I'm saying is we
focus on the principles. The
non initiation of force is,

720
00:39:04,301 --> 00:39:05,590
I think a universal principle.

721
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,640
What happens on the other side of that
is absolutely and guessable it's like

722
00:39:09,641 --> 00:39:12,460
saying what a phone is going to be
like in 200 years. Like nobody knows.

723
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:16,690
Right. So you're saying that the most
important things to get rid of what is

724
00:39:16,691 --> 00:39:19,360
essentially a corrupt
and evil institution.

725
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,640
Get rid of that and then figure it out.

726
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:25,090
I mean, did you didn't? No, you didn't.

727
00:39:25,091 --> 00:39:28,960
And nobody ended slavery because
things would be better afterwards.

728
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:32,590
We ended slavery because it was an
Mrl institution. Right. And the state,

729
00:39:32,591 --> 00:39:35,670
which relies on the initiation
of force is fundamentally Mr.

730
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:38,100
But isn't there a difference
between ending slavery,

731
00:39:38,101 --> 00:39:42,600
which is essentially a crime against
humanity and ending government because

732
00:39:42,601 --> 00:39:46,860
government is essentially
how we keep order and is in
our countries. They really,

733
00:39:46,861 --> 00:39:49,980
as far as like you're bathing in
an excess of order these days,

734
00:39:49,981 --> 00:39:54,780
I don't feel like it's perfect,
but it's more order than chaos.

735
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,540
So I don't think that it's
ideal. No, absolutely not.

736
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:05,400
But is it some form of an order?
Clearly it's flawed.

737
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:09,180
Clearly I don't like the tax scenario.

738
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,600
I mean the tax situation is,
is grotesque.

739
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:17,840
I mean the idea of being forced to pay
money for crimes against humanity in

740
00:40:19,481 --> 00:40:21,210
other countries,
which is essentially what,

741
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:25,470
when you see thousands of people that
are innocent, that got killed by drones,

742
00:40:25,471 --> 00:40:28,920
a million innocence killed in Iraq,
if that's not a crime against humanity,

743
00:40:28,921 --> 00:40:30,540
what is a crime against humanity?

744
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:33,900
If millions of people dying
isn't a crime against humanity?

745
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:36,570
What's a crime against
humanity? I don't, well,

746
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:41,340
clearly slavery was a co a crime
against humanity, taking people,

747
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:46,350
locking them up, making them work against
their will, selling them as objects,

748
00:40:46,351 --> 00:40:51,351
as property abolishing that is not
the same as abolishing any form of

749
00:40:52,921 --> 00:40:53,754
government.

750
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:58,040
It was a foundation for all of human
society, all the way throughout history,

751
00:40:58,041 --> 00:41:01,040
and it was central.
It was central to how the economy worked.

752
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,250
Like why was that no industrial
revolution and the ancient Greek and Roman

753
00:41:04,251 --> 00:41:06,530
civilizations,
they'd even discovered the steam engine.

754
00:41:06,531 --> 00:41:09,980
They knew all about this stuff. Why?
Why was there no industrial revolution?

755
00:41:09,981 --> 00:41:13,820
Which was really the basis
of all the wealth we have
now because they had slaves.

756
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,790
And so when you buy a bunch of slaves,

757
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:19,190
you don't want to invest
in labor saving machinery.

758
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:23,570
You have to get rid of slavery in order
for machinery to do the work of slaves

759
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:27,140
or of of human beings, because then it
becomes cost efficient and cost effective.

760
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:31,460
So it's central to how society's south
organized. Slavery was a central,

761
00:41:31,461 --> 00:41:35,750
I would argue to historical as government
is. It's how everything was done.

762
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:40,850
You know, that's an old story about,
about Rome where one guy, one,

763
00:41:40,851 --> 00:41:42,110
one, Patricia was saying, I don't know,

764
00:41:42,111 --> 00:41:44,730
I can do some bizarre upper class
Roman accent. I don't know much,

765
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,370
but that would be like, I don't even
know what the shot, it's always English.

766
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,570
Just pretend some British
guy. I was like, oh my God.

767
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:53,210
I was walking down the street
and I said hello to a slave.

768
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:55,910
I don't even know which one's a
slaves and which ones aren't slaves.

769
00:41:55,911 --> 00:41:59,360
We should make them all way
yellow tags on their shoulders.

770
00:41:59,361 --> 00:42:02,330
So none of us ended up talking to slaves
and the other guy said, are you crazy?

771
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,760
We can't put yellow tags on the slaves.

772
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:09,410
Otherwise they'll see how many
there are and how few we are. Right?

773
00:42:09,411 --> 00:42:13,520
So like 70 80% of the population
in some cultures were slaves.

774
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:19,060
And so it was as central to the ancient
world and to a lot of the modern

775
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:22,430
societies up until sort of the 17th
18th century as government is to now.

776
00:42:22,431 --> 00:42:26,180
And it says incomprehensible for them
to think post slavery as it is for us to

777
00:42:26,181 --> 00:42:27,014
think post state.

778
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:32,630
But the moral principles I think have
to win out rather than consequentialism.

779
00:42:32,631 --> 00:42:36,320
Like because we can't possibly guess
what will happen in terms of spontaneous

780
00:42:36,321 --> 00:42:38,810
self organization when you get
rid of the coercion of the state.

781
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:43,010
The problem with your analogy though is
that during the same time that the south

782
00:42:43,011 --> 00:42:47,210
had slavery, the North had
abolished slavery. So then
in the north was prospering.

783
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:50,930
So they were Cohen coexisting.
So there was not,

784
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:55,990
not only was there a clear example of
a profitable forward moving society

785
00:42:57,711 --> 00:43:02,330
without slavery, it was connected on the
same continental mass. I mean, it was,

786
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:05,480
it was a part of North America.
It was the country.

787
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:09,500
It was even a part of the actual union.
It was, they were trying to succeed,

788
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,990
but they had,
I mean the,

789
00:43:11,991 --> 00:43:16,991
the North had no slavery and they had
excellent cities and they had buildings

790
00:43:19,041 --> 00:43:22,370
and they were building ships and
it was all done through paid labor,

791
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,990
whereas at the same time,
the south had slavery. I've,

792
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:29,690
I saw something that I thought was really
fascinating that you argued and you

793
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:32,990
argued that the south should
have been allowed to succeed.

794
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,960
And then if the north wanted
the slaves to be free,

795
00:43:35,961 --> 00:43:38,240
they should have purchased
them from the south.

796
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:41,790
Oh, that's how slavery ended
up or where else? I mean,

797
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:46,590
the British government and the British
taxpayers paid for a lot of the slaves

798
00:43:46,591 --> 00:43:49,920
that's record or some
British, um, priest. A bishop,

799
00:43:49,921 --> 00:43:53,220
I think was paid like 12,000
pounds for his slaves. Basically,

800
00:43:53,221 --> 00:43:56,640
the way that slavery ended throughout
most of the rest of the world was the

801
00:43:56,641 --> 00:43:58,110
government stopped catching slaves.

802
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:02,970
And when the government stops
catching slaves, they just,
it has to be socialized.

803
00:44:02,971 --> 00:44:05,070
You can't go around chasing slaves
who are running all over the place.

804
00:44:05,071 --> 00:44:09,090
It doesn't work anymore. The government
and slaves that are escaping. Yeah. Yeah.

805
00:44:09,091 --> 00:44:11,610
So if, if the government
stops catching the slaves,

806
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,170
then it's not cost efficient to keep them.

807
00:44:13,171 --> 00:44:16,170
You have to socialize that cost and the
cost. The government at the end of south,

808
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:20,850
uh, the government forced, uh,
white people to go on slave
patrols all the time. Oh,

809
00:44:20,851 --> 00:44:23,640
they'd throw them in jail.
Right. So looking for slim.
Yeah. Looking for slaves.

810
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:24,930
They hated that.
Uh,

811
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,960
so did it take 600,000
people dying to end slavery?

812
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:32,100
Well,
only in America

813
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:37,080
did that. Was that a requirement?
Everywhere else it was,
it was money, uh, and um,

814
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,410
uh, moral brow beating and all
that kind of stuff and legislation.

815
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:44,100
It was the only in America. Was
that a required? Isn't that,

816
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:47,970
wouldn't it be required that they
would agree to that though? I mean,

817
00:44:47,971 --> 00:44:50,370
what if they didn't want to
give up their free labor?

818
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:55,400
I mean the whole idea was you're saying
that the reason why certain societies

819
00:44:55,711 --> 00:44:59,760
did not advance past a certain position
was because they relied on slavery.

820
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:02,040
And if you come along and you say,
hey,

821
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:06,240
we're going to buy all the slaves
from the south, what if they say, no,

822
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:07,950
we want to keep our free labor.

823
00:45:07,951 --> 00:45:11,730
It's more profitable for us to keep
these slaves and make them work.

824
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:14,340
But You keep bidding up until it's
more profitable to sell them. Well,

825
00:45:14,341 --> 00:45:16,740
how do they, where's the United
States get all this money?

826
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:19,920
Them might not have the north get
the money to buy all those slaves.

827
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:24,330
Where does that money come from? It comes
from not having 600,000 people dead.

828
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,570
Right. And when does it come from
taxes? Before the people are dead?

829
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:31,710
There's no debt of death.
No, but what I mean, I said,
yeah, it was hugely expensive,

830
00:45:31,711 --> 00:45:33,850
right?
I'm just saying from a cost standpoint,

831
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:36,750
it would have been much less expensive
to buy the slaves then it would be who

832
00:45:36,751 --> 00:45:38,250
would have been to a wage that entire war.

833
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:40,500
That's a hindsight is 2020
argument though, isn't it?

834
00:45:40,501 --> 00:45:43,080
Because no one knew how many people were
going to die in the war and no one knew

835
00:45:43,081 --> 00:45:44,520
how expensive it was going to be.

836
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:47,460
They just decided that they were going
to go to war and they were going to win.

837
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:50,310
Right.
And that's how a lot of wars are fought.

838
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:54,840
That's how we got an Iraq and that's how
a million people are dead and countless

839
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:57,090
amounts of money have been spent.
I mean we,

840
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,670
who fucking knows how much money was
spent and our rabidly since 2001 I think

841
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,990
that if it didn't,
they just fly over like giant crates,

842
00:46:03,991 --> 00:46:08,040
full of hundred dollar bills and basically
just throw them into the wind. I mean,

843
00:46:08,041 --> 00:46:11,250
there's just huge amounts of
of cash itself just went there.

844
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,310
But that's the big lesson of history is
that once you let slip the dogs of war,

845
00:46:14,311 --> 00:46:15,540
you don't know who they're
going to take down.

846
00:46:15,541 --> 00:46:16,860
You don't know how long it's gonna last.

847
00:46:16,861 --> 00:46:18,390
You don't know what the
blow back is going to be.

848
00:46:18,391 --> 00:46:22,380
That's one of the big lessons is that
there's very few examples of contained

849
00:46:22,381 --> 00:46:26,130
wars in very few examples of wars that
match the expectations that people going

850
00:46:26,131 --> 00:46:29,770
in. So with hindsight being 20,
20, and 600,000 people dying.

851
00:46:29,771 --> 00:46:33,690
And what were the actual numbers of
slaves that were eventually freed?

852
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:38,190
Do we know how many, I've done a whole
video on the history of slavery. Yeah.

853
00:46:38,191 --> 00:46:41,200
I can't remember honestly.
Then I feel sometimes like a,

854
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,320
a pipe with through which knowledge,

855
00:46:43,321 --> 00:46:47,370
pastas leaving no residue like to do
these presentations. You know what I mean?

856
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:50,340
You've had, you know, hundreds and
hundreds of great conversation,

857
00:46:50,341 --> 00:46:54,510
but somebody said, oh, what
did the podcast one thing to
do. Yeah. My memory sucks.

858
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:58,410
I mean, it's pretty good,
but it sucks compared to what
I would like it to be. Oh,

859
00:46:58,411 --> 00:47:02,890
I'd love to be this giant,
you know, Museum of everything
that happened. But, uh, uh,

860
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:07,080
so documents I think a pretty strong that
it would have been much cheaper, uh, to,

861
00:47:07,081 --> 00:47:08,120
to simply by the method.

862
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:11,910
The other option of course is that you
let them succeed and you let them have

863
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,270
their slaves.
Uh,

864
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,950
and then the north gets more and more
prosperous and the south generally stays

865
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:19,260
or it becomes less and less
prosperous relative to handle.

866
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:24,030
Allow that on your watch. How can you
allow people to be enslaved? I mean, if,

867
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:28,890
if there's anything that you as
a person with morals and ethics,

868
00:47:28,891 --> 00:47:32,680
a person that wants the,
the human race to advance and evolve,

869
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:35,740
there's anything that you would
want to stop. It would be slavery.

870
00:47:35,741 --> 00:47:39,970
That's one of the first things.
First, you know, uh, abusive children,

871
00:47:39,971 --> 00:47:44,080
child slavery. I mean, in
that order it's slavery.

872
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:45,700
It's like number one,

873
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:49,000
it'd be one of the murder and slavery
would be like right next to each other.

874
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:51,640
Those are the things you would
want to stop, but you can't,

875
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:56,740
you can't fight slavery with conscription.
Conscription meaning what?

876
00:47:56,770 --> 00:48:00,040
Meaning that you are forcing people to
come and fight your war because that's

877
00:48:00,041 --> 00:48:02,350
even worse than slavery.
Okay.

878
00:48:02,351 --> 00:48:05,510
So did there's a six and a half to
be pulled up during the civil war?

879
00:48:05,511 --> 00:48:10,210
Is that a draft situation? So they force
people to fight against the south? Look,

880
00:48:10,211 --> 00:48:13,900
it wasn't a good plan.
It didn't work out well.

881
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:18,880
The only good part of it was that the
slaves were freed and slavery's illegal.

882
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:23,320
Yeah. And I mean I would
lie. I think that's a way,

883
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:26,230
like I never advocate violence
with regards to the state.

884
00:48:26,231 --> 00:48:28,420
It's something we outgrow.
Its something we reasoned about.

885
00:48:28,421 --> 00:48:30,970
It's something we discussed. It's
something we look for alternatives for.

886
00:48:30,971 --> 00:48:32,620
And you can see a lot of
these things showing up.

887
00:48:32,621 --> 00:48:36,180
Even in Detroit there's a private to
police forces now cause the police that

888
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:39,130
basically said, you know, if you call
and you get an answering machine,

889
00:48:39,131 --> 00:48:39,941
you're lucky.
Right?

890
00:48:39,941 --> 00:48:43,090
I mean the police had basically abandoned
sections of Detroit that are wild dogs

891
00:48:43,091 --> 00:48:45,970
going through there that people have set
up their own bus systems where you can

892
00:48:45,971 --> 00:48:47,560
have a beer and there's Wifi on them.

893
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:52,360
I mean there's lots of things that rush
into to take the place of a decaying or

894
00:48:52,361 --> 00:48:56,830
diminishing state systems. And
I, it's just something we act,

895
00:48:56,831 --> 00:49:00,310
grow over time through a compensation
and it is a multigenerational change.

896
00:49:00,311 --> 00:49:01,960
It's not going to happen anytime soon.

897
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:06,370
But I do think that we are still a long
way from don as far as a really great

898
00:49:06,371 --> 00:49:10,570
society goes and um, I look at the
biggest institutions around and I,

899
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:15,820
I think that everything is
open to question. I think
you do as well, but I just,

900
00:49:15,821 --> 00:49:16,601
I can't sort of say,

901
00:49:16,601 --> 00:49:21,430
well what's on the other side of a
truly free society where people are not

902
00:49:21,431 --> 00:49:24,850
subject to the initiation of force known
as the state? I don't know. I don't know.

903
00:49:24,851 --> 00:49:27,670
I don't know either. And I like
having these conversations with you.

904
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:31,990
I like having these conversations in this
sort of a diff, a form. We're bouncing,

905
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:36,070
bouncing these ideas back and
forth and we admit we don't know.

906
00:49:36,071 --> 00:49:39,190
And there are possibilities when
you do your videos, whoever you're,

907
00:49:39,191 --> 00:49:44,050
you're doing these essentially these hour
long pieces and you're very eloquent.

908
00:49:44,051 --> 00:49:45,580
You are very good speaker and it's,

909
00:49:45,581 --> 00:49:48,400
it's very unusual how
eloquent you are because you,

910
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:53,500
you don't use ums or Uhs, you don't
stammer a lot and no jump cuts. Right.

911
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:55,060
It's not like I had to be in the cuts.

912
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:57,970
You're obviously very impressed with
yourself doing that. I'm just mentioning.

913
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:00,610
I am happy with it.
They're good. You're great.

914
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:05,350
I haven't looked at it for awhile so,
but in that aren't a lot of these ideas.

915
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,860
They're not, it's, it's not, these aren't
essentially black and white issues.

916
00:50:08,861 --> 00:50:11,560
And when you state them as if
they are black and white issues,

917
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:15,610
that's what opens up all these
portals of debate and dissent.

918
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:20,910
And there's just quite a few places
online where people were upset at you and

919
00:50:21,341 --> 00:50:24,520
quite a few things that you've
said in these hour long,

920
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:28,220
eloquent pieces that people
are vehemently opposed.

921
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:32,610
Yeah. And I'm annoyed that it's not
more like really, I'm really, I want Eh,

922
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:37,190
people don't you try to stop them,
stop them. Don't you pull videos down,

923
00:50:37,191 --> 00:50:41,150
don't you like whole videos for copyright
infringement and tell people to not

924
00:50:41,151 --> 00:50:44,780
make video? Oh No, no, no,
no. Oh, this, sorry. This just
recently happened. So yeah,

925
00:50:44,781 --> 00:50:47,120
this is a guy who worked at FDR.
Um,

926
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:51,410
there was a trial out there who
IDR free domain. Main radio.

927
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:55,580
Yeah. So there was a, I'm a guy,

928
00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:57,490
I'm going to say trawl is going
to poison the well, right.

929
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:00,190
There was a fellow out there I
think in the man, a gentleman, oh,

930
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:04,010
have a trolley persuasion. Um, and he,

931
00:51:04,011 --> 00:51:07,220
I do these colon chose when people call
and we talk about sort of philosophy and

932
00:51:07,221 --> 00:51:08,390
ideas and whatever else.

933
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:13,960
And he had gotten some of those calls
and it through means I don't pretend to

934
00:51:15,051 --> 00:51:17,180
understand. He had, you
know, doxing where you,

935
00:51:17,181 --> 00:51:19,160
you start revealing people's
personal information.

936
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:22,050
He'd got pictures of their kids.
He'd found out where they lived.

937
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:24,770
He had just done stuff where he was,
um,

938
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:27,560
someone just called in and he
got pictures of their kids.

939
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:31,870
What can I tell you what
I mean? I do, I do. I can,

940
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:34,880
can I pretend to know why people do
this now when this person called in,

941
00:51:34,881 --> 00:51:36,560
but I want to elaborate
or sorry to interrupt,

942
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,040
but with these people
being threatening with a,

943
00:51:40,041 --> 00:51:42,810
criticizing you and some
sort of an, oh, I know, I,

944
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:45,770
I think we were just having a
conversation about something,

945
00:51:46,490 --> 00:51:49,940
trying to get this information about
their families. Well, so, so I,

946
00:51:49,941 --> 00:51:53,270
let's say I call someone named
Barb called in. Okay. And then, um,

947
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:58,370
someone took that slice of
our conversation and work
like crazy to try and find

948
00:51:58,371 --> 00:52:01,550
everything out about Bob and then
publish videos with pictures of Barb and

949
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:07,080
pretty personal. So everybody uses
my staff and I don't care about it.

950
00:52:07,081 --> 00:52:10,370
And you're going to do a search on
youtube for my staff and everybody and

951
00:52:10,371 --> 00:52:13,370
everybody who said, I'd really
like to reuse your stuff.
I'm like, Hey, go for it.

952
00:52:13,371 --> 00:52:17,090
Right. But we had a number of listeners
who called in and said, listen,

953
00:52:17,091 --> 00:52:20,180
this guy's doing some pretty creepy
stuff with my personal info here. It,

954
00:52:20,181 --> 00:52:23,240
I'm not comfortable with it. So we
use that mechanism to take that down.

955
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,430
It's got nothing to do with
copyright or anything like that.

956
00:52:25,431 --> 00:52:28,730
I just felt that listeners were being
acted against in a negative way,

957
00:52:28,731 --> 00:52:31,340
significantly negative ways.
So that's what we did.

958
00:52:31,341 --> 00:52:33,530
But it's nothing to do with copyright
or anything like that and people,

959
00:52:33,531 --> 00:52:37,580
people use my stuff all the time.
That's incredibly bizarre. So this was,

960
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:42,820
was this a scare tactic to threaten
people that were criticizing you was no,

961
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:46,490
no, it, it's, it's a scare tactic to try
and get people to not call into my shell.

962
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:47,030
Like,

963
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:50,840
so we'll target people who tried to call
into your show and then we will start

964
00:52:50,841 --> 00:52:53,150
trying to find out personal
information about them and so on.

965
00:52:53,151 --> 00:52:55,850
And it's only one or two people
and it's only happened once,

966
00:52:55,851 --> 00:52:57,740
but that's why we did
that. Uh, that's why, uh,

967
00:52:57,860 --> 00:53:00,880
Mike decided to do that thing on youtube,
which I fully agree with.

968
00:53:00,890 --> 00:53:03,140
I think it's a terrible use of uh,
uh,

969
00:53:03,141 --> 00:53:06,500
of time and it's a negative thing
to do and someone else but people,

970
00:53:06,501 --> 00:53:08,710
I mean if I was, if I
was interested in, in,

971
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:11,300
in taking down people's who use my stuff,

972
00:53:11,301 --> 00:53:14,450
then why on earth would there be so many
of my videos re posted all over youtube.

973
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,410
Do you think that maybe part of the
problem with your perception, your Po,

974
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:22,520
the public perception of you is that
you don't engage in these kinds of

975
00:53:22,521 --> 00:53:26,010
conversations where you're allowed to
elaborate on your question on things and

976
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:30,300
people get to see a more
nuanced perspective on what
do you mean big instead of

977
00:53:30,301 --> 00:53:34,360
this like hour long echo chamber
where you do these videos, he just,

978
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:39,180
it's your thoughts. Bang,
Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang. Thank
you. Good night. W you know,

979
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:40,440
it's like, uh, there's a,

980
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:45,590
there's a bit that I've done
about on stage where like it's,

981
00:53:45,591 --> 00:53:50,591
it's amazing that you can get someone to
sit down and listen to you talk for an

982
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:53,760
hour because most of the times
when people are talking it's,

983
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:58,170
they're having a conversation. It's a
very unnatural form to have like, uh, uh,

984
00:53:58,171 --> 00:54:02,820
like a long rant or a lecture.
It's a fairly recent thing
in human history, right?

985
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:06,300
And that most of the times when people
are talking for an hour, you're like far,

986
00:54:06,301 --> 00:54:07,430
I got some shit to say to.

987
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:10,770
And that's isn't that what's kind of
going on with a lot of the criticism

988
00:54:10,771 --> 00:54:11,604
against you?

989
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:16,860
I do six to seven hours of
colon shows a week. Right?

990
00:54:16,861 --> 00:54:21,780
So I am not like a, it's not like a one
way street in what it is that I do. Right.

991
00:54:21,810 --> 00:54:26,810
And we've had a standing policy for I
think three years that if you have a

992
00:54:27,061 --> 00:54:29,660
criticism of me, you go to
the front of the line. I mean,

993
00:54:29,661 --> 00:54:34,230
we were booking people into the winter
now who want to talk on this show on

994
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:37,380
unfree to main radio. Uh, people
are booked up until November,

995
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:41,230
but if you have a criticism of me, you
get to the front, you bump everyone,

996
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:42,270
you get to the front of the line.

997
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:46,860
So as far as people who have issues with
me or disagree with things that I say,

998
00:54:46,861 --> 00:54:49,950
you'll have better reason than evidence.
Fantastic. I mean, I've done entire shows,

999
00:54:49,951 --> 00:54:50,700
what I've read out,

1000
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:53,640
somebody's criticisms of media and
things that I got wrong and all that.

1001
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:56,940
I am very open to correction.
Lord knows,

1002
00:54:56,941 --> 00:54:59,880
I mean I'm at one human being with
some researchers and all that, so yeah,

1003
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:03,060
make mistakes are made and I've
admitted to mistakes that I've made in

1004
00:55:03,061 --> 00:55:03,894
researching and so on,

1005
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:08,460
but if people want to tell me that I'm
doing something wrong or want to debate

1006
00:55:08,461 --> 00:55:11,010
with me, they get to the very
front of the line every time.

1007
00:55:11,011 --> 00:55:12,150
But they just never really show up.

1008
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:15,930
But it's not necessarily things
that you're getting wrong.

1009
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:21,110
It's people disagreeing with
positions that you have that it's,

1010
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:23,640
you can't say it's right or wrong,

1011
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:27,000
but these are very strong positions that
you have. For one. There's a video of,

1012
00:55:27,001 --> 00:55:28,980
you were talking about being an,

1013
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:33,540
you consider yourself an
an arco capitalist that the
best way to describe it,

1014
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,590
and you were telling people
that if they weren't,

1015
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:41,430
if their friends were not
also a narco capitalists,

1016
00:55:41,470 --> 00:55:43,260
they should abandon those friends.

1017
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:44,970
They should cut those
friends out of their lives.

1018
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:50,610
I don't think I've ever said there's
one time in sort of an eight year show

1019
00:55:50,611 --> 00:55:51,840
history where I said to someone,

1020
00:55:51,841 --> 00:55:53,670
I think you need to not have
these people in your life.

1021
00:55:53,671 --> 00:55:55,140
And that's because he was suicidal.
But

1022
00:55:56,700 --> 00:56:00,870
there is a principle that is I
think really important, right?

1023
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:04,470
And it is part of a long term
conversation that you have with people.

1024
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:08,760
So let's say that, uh, I
like to smoke marijuana.

1025
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:12,540
Let's just go out on a limb here and
say, I like to smoke marijuana. Now,

1026
00:56:12,541 --> 00:56:16,860
people who support the war
on drugs literally do support
me being thrown in jail

1027
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:20,250
for the peaceful activity
of smoking marijuana.

1028
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:24,010
Now that's a very real thing.
People who

1029
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:27,250
support the war on drugs to
support me being thrown in jail.

1030
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:31,870
And that is a pretty aggressive thing to
have around you. Now, this doesn't mean,

1031
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:34,090
oh, you disagree with me, I'm
never going to talk to you again.

1032
00:56:34,091 --> 00:56:35,950
I talk all the time to
people who disagree with me,

1033
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:39,520
but I will say that in my
very personal relationships,

1034
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:42,370
in sort of my close friends
and family and so on,

1035
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:46,840
I really can't it myself.
I can't get past this idea that I have.

1036
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:49,480
If I have people in my life who say,
staff,

1037
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:51,910
if you disagree with me
about the welfare state,

1038
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:55,030
I think the welfare state is a complete
disaster and incredibly destructive to

1039
00:56:55,031 --> 00:56:59,500
the poor. Then you must pay the
taxes for the welfare state.

1040
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:03,400
Or I support you being thrown in jail.
Or if people are pro the war in Iraq,

1041
00:57:03,401 --> 00:57:06,250
I would say, I mean I'm Canadian,
but let's say I was in America.

1042
00:57:06,310 --> 00:57:09,010
And if people say to me,
Steph,

1043
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:12,760
I think you should be thrown in jail
for not supporting the war in Iraq.

1044
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:16,150
Well that would be a pretty aggressive
action for somebody to sort of eyeball

1045
00:57:16,151 --> 00:57:18,640
you and say, yes, people should
come and throw you in jail.

1046
00:57:18,670 --> 00:57:20,860
Were God awful things are
going to happen to you.

1047
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:24,730
That to me is a very aggressive
and very real thing that happens.

1048
00:57:24,731 --> 00:57:28,720
And if you are committed to a belief
system, then in the long run, again,

1049
00:57:28,721 --> 00:57:31,720
this is not a short term scenario,
and I've done speeches, full speeches,

1050
00:57:31,721 --> 00:57:34,780
there's one in Liberty Apia 2010 where
I've sort of go into this in more detail,

1051
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,620
but if you are committed to something,
like let's say you're against racism,

1052
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:41,530
which is of course a wonderful
thing to be against at some point,

1053
00:57:41,531 --> 00:57:45,940
if you got friends in the KKK, you gotta
make a choice. You have to make a choice.

1054
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:49,540
If you say, well, I really want
the friends in the KKK, then fine,

1055
00:57:49,541 --> 00:57:52,900
then you're just not that much of an
antiracist, right? I get it. Right?

1056
00:57:53,590 --> 00:57:54,580
But if you say,
well,

1057
00:57:54,581 --> 00:57:57,520
I want to be a committed antiracist and
I want to maintain my friendships in the

1058
00:57:57,521 --> 00:58:01,420
KKK, this kind of a problem, right?
So it's, and, and so I say, look,

1059
00:58:01,570 --> 00:58:04,720
if you want to hang around with a bunch
of people who want you thrown in jail

1060
00:58:04,721 --> 00:58:07,420
for following your conscience,
do it. That's completely fine,

1061
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:10,180
but don't say that you're committed
to the belief system then. Right?

1062
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:11,980
If you are committed to the belief system,

1063
00:58:11,981 --> 00:58:14,490
this is going to be a collision
at some point. I mean, I don't,

1064
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:16,840
that's not something I'm making up.
That seems to me to be pretty true,

1065
00:58:16,841 --> 00:58:18,430
but that's sort of where people get upset.

1066
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:20,000
I don't think that's very controversial.

1067
00:58:20,001 --> 00:58:22,190
I think what you're saying is very
reasonable. It makes a lot of sense.

1068
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:27,220
But the video that I saw was you talking
about people that support the state

1069
00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:32,390
saying that if you support the state,
you support people that want you dead.

1070
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:35,510
These are exactly what laws
the state wants you dead.

1071
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:39,500
That's what laws are though.
If you disobey laws and
you resist police officer,

1072
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:44,000
but wow, sword it from you.
Which laws are you talking about?

1073
00:58:44,001 --> 00:58:49,001
I mean this state encompasses a broad
range of laws that range from traffic

1074
00:58:49,731 --> 00:58:52,580
lights too. You know what I mean?
There's a lot going on there.

1075
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:56,720
Supporting the state mean if
you're not in a narco capitalist,

1076
00:58:56,870 --> 00:59:00,650
you support the state and you were saying
that you should cut those people out

1077
00:59:00,651 --> 00:59:02,720
of your life.
Anyone who supports the state,

1078
00:59:02,721 --> 00:59:05,480
I mean that is a incredibly
generalized position,

1079
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:08,590
but you're boiling down like a,
I gave you a sort of very compressed

1080
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:12,680
did there right now, but in the video
that I watched, it's you, you're,

1081
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:17,740
you were going on and on about cutting
people out of your life that support the

1082
00:59:18,691 --> 00:59:21,990
state and essentially this idea of

1083
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:26,510
this philosophy that you have about how
to live life being the one that these

1084
00:59:26,511 --> 00:59:30,230
people should have spouse and everything
else is dangerous and you should cut

1085
00:59:30,231 --> 00:59:31,970
these people out of your life.
Well,

1086
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:36,110
was that at the end of me making the
argument? I mean, if that's sort of, if,

1087
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:38,150
if somebody just takes out
of the tail end, right?

1088
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:41,750
So I sort of gave you the argument here
that if you're an antiracist at some

1089
00:59:41,751 --> 00:59:45,500
point you got to stop hanging with the
KKK people or give up on your anti racism.

1090
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:49,260
I mean that's so, uh, it
calling it the state is such a,

1091
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,260
it's such a crazy term.

1092
00:59:51,950 --> 00:59:55,310
It's such a broad term saying that
anyone who supports the state,

1093
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:58,700
you need to cut out of your life.
What does, there's no, you're not,

1094
00:59:58,701 --> 00:59:59,690
you don't feel that way.

1095
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:05,300
So should I play the video so you can
listen to what it is that you said would

1096
01:00:05,301 --> 01:00:05,520
be?

1097
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:10,520
Probably because I'm sort of trying to
tie him up to 3000 records or whatever,

1098
01:00:10,761 --> 01:00:14,570
but yeah, that's here. Okay. Let's
see. Can you a I s I emailed it to you,

1099
01:00:14,571 --> 01:00:17,400
right Jamie, let's, uh, cause uh,

1100
01:00:18,170 --> 01:00:23,170
it's a fascinating clip and I think you
elaborating on it and enlightened or

1101
01:00:24,261 --> 01:00:28,100
illuminates rather, your positions
are these things and it's hot.

1102
01:00:28,101 --> 01:00:33,101
It's easy to like say something in a rant
and then have people go and all sorts

1103
01:00:33,141 --> 01:00:35,840
of different directions with it. So
it's, uh, let's listen to what it says

1104
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:40,840
by this time tomorrow, you call up
the people, you know, when you say,

1105
01:00:41,230 --> 01:00:43,450
I've got a question to ask you,
I know it's going to be uncomfortable,

1106
01:00:43,451 --> 01:00:48,080
then you know something about my beliefs.
And I don't mean to put you in the, uh,

1107
01:00:48,130 --> 01:00:50,770
put you on the spot, but you kind
of got a gun against my temple.

1108
01:00:50,771 --> 01:00:52,360
So I just want to talk about that.

1109
01:00:53,770 --> 01:00:56,140
I know we've talked a lot about all
the abstract things in the universe,

1110
01:00:56,141 --> 01:00:59,290
but I want to ask you a question directly
and it's better to talk to people face

1111
01:00:59,291 --> 01:01:00,124
to face.

1112
01:01:00,130 --> 01:01:04,630
It's harder to point a gun at
somebody face to face even.

1113
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:05,940
Yeah,

1114
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:08,040
in an abstract manner.
I talked to them face to face,

1115
01:01:08,041 --> 01:01:09,690
go sit down with them at
a coffee shop and say,

1116
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:14,040
so I just want to understand
the basis of our relationship.

1117
01:01:14,041 --> 01:01:16,370
So you claim to have some affection
from me, some love for me,

1118
01:01:16,371 --> 01:01:17,480
some respect from me or whatever.

1119
01:01:17,481 --> 01:01:19,850
And you assume that something positive
for the relationship and you say to them,

1120
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:24,540
sitting across from
them, you say, excuse me.

1121
01:01:24,990 --> 01:01:27,870
You say, do you support the
use of violence against me?

1122
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:32,353
Yeah.

1123
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:35,780
And they all of course. No, of
course not. It's like, oh, okay.

1124
01:01:35,781 --> 01:01:37,600
So then we're on the same ground.
So

1125
01:01:39,130 --> 01:01:42,490
you don't support the use of violence
just against me or do you support the use

1126
01:01:42,491 --> 01:01:44,770
of violence against everyone
except me. I was like, no,

1127
01:01:44,771 --> 01:01:46,810
I don't support the use of
violence against anyone. It's like,

1128
01:01:46,811 --> 01:01:51,170
well then you must be an anarchist or
at an ACO capitalist or voluntary as to

1129
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:54,460
whatever the hell you must be.
A philosopher gonna speak basically decent

1130
01:01:57,090 --> 01:02:00,060
and they say, well, no, I don't want
to. I still believe in the state.

1131
01:02:00,061 --> 01:02:02,760
I still believe in taxation.
I still believe in government.

1132
01:02:02,761 --> 01:02:06,520
I still believe in front Paul.
Okay,

1133
01:02:06,521 --> 01:02:08,590
well then you do support the
use of violence against me.

1134
01:02:10,490 --> 01:02:13,980
They will do whatever they can
to disconnect these two things,

1135
01:02:13,981 --> 01:02:14,820
theory and practice

1136
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:19,150
so they can get all the emotional
comforts of conformity with the theory.

1137
01:02:19,290 --> 01:02:22,710
None of the emotional discomforts of
actually advocating somebody getting shot,

1138
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:25,140
which people that others are
totally uncomfortable with,

1139
01:02:25,141 --> 01:02:28,200
but don't let them have their cake and
eat it too. It's not because you're mean.

1140
01:02:28,201 --> 01:02:33,030
That's just reality. If you support me
getting shot, at least have the courage,

1141
01:02:33,031 --> 01:02:36,750
the balls to look me in the eye
and say, staff, I support you.

1142
01:02:36,751 --> 01:02:40,140
Getting shot and then I can get
you the fuck out of my life.

1143
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:46,870
Cause how can I have even
a shred of self esteem,

1144
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:52,830
a shred of pride in my own existence if
I'm willing to hang out with people who

1145
01:02:53,141 --> 01:02:54,400
want the shot

1146
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:58,720
that's sick.

1147
01:03:00,220 --> 01:03:05,220
That is how the basement self grovelling
self denigration of the most revolting.

1148
01:03:14,650 --> 01:03:18,640
Well I know that you want to be shocked
but uh hey can I maybe get a little more

1149
01:03:18,641 --> 01:03:19,474
meatloaf?

1150
01:03:24,150 --> 01:03:25,320
And if we're not willing to do that,

1151
01:03:25,321 --> 01:03:28,050
like if we're not willing to put our
personal relationships to the test,

1152
01:03:28,110 --> 01:03:31,710
if we're not willing to do that, if we're
not willing to do that, that's fine.

1153
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:33,210
Nobody has to do anything.

1154
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:36,690
But don't imagine you have
anything to do with libertarianism.

1155
01:03:36,691 --> 01:03:41,100
And I'm don't imagine that
you have anything to do with
third that you are using

1156
01:03:41,101 --> 01:03:45,320
these ideas to play as a clever
card to play the cool car,

1157
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:49,380
to play the alternative card to play the
I am smarter and know more than you and

1158
01:03:49,381 --> 01:03:52,650
I'm out of the Matrix and you're in the
Matrix and we play all this nonsense.

1159
01:03:53,370 --> 01:03:57,010
Don't try and use philosophy.
Don't try and use philosophy.

1160
01:03:57,030 --> 01:04:01,020
Don't try and use ethics for your own
personal comfort and to feel superior and

1161
01:04:01,021 --> 01:04:03,660
avoid the anxiety of asking people
that basic central question,

1162
01:04:03,661 --> 01:04:06,540
which you yourself bring up,
you yourself bring this question up

1163
01:04:08,490 --> 01:04:12,270
that our taxation of violence as the
initiation of use of what you bring it up.

1164
01:04:12,271 --> 01:04:14,550
Other people don't bring this to
the conversation you bring into the

1165
01:04:14,551 --> 01:04:16,500
conversation.
So do it.

1166
01:04:17,430 --> 01:04:19,740
Bring it to the conversation.

1167
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:21,380
Yeah.

1168
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:25,290
Okay. I think we got the
gist of it there. Yeah.

1169
01:04:26,050 --> 01:04:27,380
I didn't tell anyone to leave anyone.

1170
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:32,360
I said if you are committed to
the nonaggression principle then,

1171
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:34,820
and I said at the beginning,
I said,

1172
01:04:34,821 --> 01:04:36,770
we've talked about these
things many times before,

1173
01:04:36,771 --> 01:04:39,930
so this isn't sort of like the first
time you sit down and chat with someone

1174
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:43,160
when it takes a long time
to have these conversations.

1175
01:04:43,161 --> 01:04:47,930
It took me years to get anywhere useful
in philosophy. So yeah, I mean I,

1176
01:04:47,990 --> 01:04:49,970
I'm always sort of curious
about, you know, people say,

1177
01:04:49,971 --> 01:04:52,160
oh this is terrible stuff that you said,
not that you were saying that,

1178
01:04:52,190 --> 01:04:54,140
oh this is really controversial
stuff that you said.

1179
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:58,340
And then they play it and we're like,
did I say something really crazy?

1180
01:04:58,341 --> 01:04:59,540
And then I watch it? I'm like, yeah,

1181
01:04:59,541 --> 01:05:02,960
like I still believe even
more of that now than I did.

1182
01:05:02,961 --> 01:05:06,590
This is probably back in
2008 because I want you dead.

1183
01:05:06,591 --> 01:05:09,740
This is my problem with it.
The state doesn't want you dead.

1184
01:05:09,741 --> 01:05:13,610
The state wants order
over 350 million people.

1185
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:16,760
They want to figure out
how to keep schools in

1186
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:21,890
roads, in order law
enforcement in order. That's,

1187
01:05:21,990 --> 01:05:25,030
that's what they're trying to do. They
might be doing a really shitty job of it,

1188
01:05:25,031 --> 01:05:28,540
but the idea that they want you dead,
it's,

1189
01:05:28,690 --> 01:05:32,650
they don't want their population dead. If
everyone was dead, there'd be no money.

1190
01:05:32,651 --> 01:05:37,510
There'd be no live to be no civilization.
It's not. It's, it's, in my opinion,

1191
01:05:37,570 --> 01:05:42,550
that's not an effective way to phrase
that and it's leading misleading, in fact,

1192
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:45,550
because it's not,
the goal of the state is to kill you.

1193
01:05:46,110 --> 01:05:48,850
You keep saying the state wants you dead.

1194
01:05:48,851 --> 01:05:52,630
That's an unfair way of
describing their position. No, no.

1195
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:56,040
Wasn't describing that. The state
wants you dead in that clip. Okay.

1196
01:05:56,140 --> 01:06:00,040
What I was describing was, um, so again,

1197
01:06:00,041 --> 01:06:03,580
if I like marijuana and you think I
should be thrown in jail for marijuana,

1198
01:06:04,270 --> 01:06:08,740
then I must comply with the laws
that you support or I will get shot.

1199
01:06:08,830 --> 01:06:13,150
I mean at the base of every law is a gun.

1200
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:16,390
I mean that's,
that's what the state is.

1201
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:21,520
That's how it's different
from a restaurant or a the
boy scouts or I mean at the

1202
01:06:21,941 --> 01:06:24,640
bottom of what the state does is again,

1203
01:06:24,641 --> 01:06:27,940
that it's the initiation of force that
is the, the, the upside down pyramid.

1204
01:06:27,941 --> 01:06:31,210
That restaurant is a bullet.
And so when people say,

1205
01:06:31,211 --> 01:06:33,490
I want the government to do this
or the government should do that,

1206
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:37,360
what they're saying is that violence,

1207
01:06:37,361 --> 01:06:39,550
the initiation of violence is how
we're going to solve this problem.

1208
01:06:39,551 --> 01:06:43,990
And that initiation of violence goes
against specific individuals. And so if,

1209
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:48,220
if you're for the war on
drugs and I enjoy using drugs,

1210
01:06:48,670 --> 01:06:50,980
then you want forced
to be used against me.

1211
01:06:50,981 --> 01:06:55,390
You want people to come and use force
against me to prevent me doing my peaceful

1212
01:06:55,391 --> 01:06:58,990
activity. And that is, I mean
stripped of all the rhetoric.

1213
01:06:58,991 --> 01:07:01,360
And all of the flag waving
and all of the Matrix.

1214
01:07:01,361 --> 01:07:06,361
He stuff that goes on there that were
raised with law is an opinion with a gun.

1215
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:11,230
That's what government
law fundamentally is. And

1216
01:07:12,730 --> 01:07:16,240
to resist the state is to risk death.

1217
01:07:16,270 --> 01:07:17,800
I mean we've seen this
over and over again.

1218
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:21,500
Do you, do you regret saying
it the way you said it?

1219
01:07:21,530 --> 01:07:24,230
Do you think that it could
be perhaps said in a,

1220
01:07:24,231 --> 01:07:29,231
in a way that more illuminates
that position rather than
this continuing use of

1221
01:07:29,361 --> 01:07:31,190
this phrase.
They want you dead,

1222
01:07:31,370 --> 01:07:35,870
they want you dead and then you separate
from the people that support people

1223
01:07:35,871 --> 01:07:36,800
that want you dead.

1224
01:07:37,310 --> 01:07:40,310
Cause that's one of the things that
people were worried about with you is that

1225
01:07:40,311 --> 01:07:41,780
they think that you're,

1226
01:07:42,530 --> 01:07:47,530
you have this main principle that you
bring up about cutting people out of your

1227
01:07:48,291 --> 01:07:50,960
life,
cutting family members out of your life,

1228
01:07:50,990 --> 01:07:54,680
cutting people out of your life that
disagree with your views on the state,

1229
01:07:54,681 --> 01:07:56,420
cutting people out of
your life and disagree.

1230
01:07:56,630 --> 01:08:01,610
And by doing that you're separating these
folks from their friends and that that

1231
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:04,190
is the foundation of cults.

1232
01:08:04,470 --> 01:08:09,470
That that is a big part of cults is
that cults separate you from your,

1233
01:08:10,070 --> 01:08:12,200
your friends that might
disagree with the cult,

1234
01:08:12,290 --> 01:08:14,990
separate you from your loved ones,
separate you,

1235
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:18,530
your family that may have some sort of
a control and bond over you so that the

1236
01:08:18,531 --> 01:08:22,160
con, the cult can have more
control over you. Like this is the,

1237
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:24,170
so are you saying I'm running a Celt,

1238
01:08:24,171 --> 01:08:26,960
is that men on me saying
that that is the argument.

1239
01:08:26,980 --> 01:08:28,270
If I thought you were running a cult,

1240
01:08:28,271 --> 01:08:31,280
I wouldn't be having a
conversation with you. But people,

1241
01:08:31,730 --> 01:08:36,730
that is a main principle of cults that
they separate you from all the descent

1242
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:41,120
from their ideas, the, the,
anybody that would disagree.

1243
01:08:41,121 --> 01:08:44,360
Anybody that would be no fear
what their control anybody with.

1244
01:08:44,570 --> 01:08:48,260
So when you're saying things like,
like what,

1245
01:08:48,261 --> 01:08:53,240
why would you say to someone like anybody
who agrees with the state cut them out

1246
01:08:53,241 --> 01:08:55,580
of your life? Like what, what
would be the goal of that?

1247
01:08:55,581 --> 01:08:58,910
Just to try to enhance that person's
life to try to say like, look,

1248
01:08:58,911 --> 01:08:59,960
my advice to you,

1249
01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:03,200
because Joe, it's a true
statement. It's not,

1250
01:09:03,201 --> 01:09:06,830
it has no sort of effect or
intent in that particular thing.

1251
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:08,600
It is a true statement.

1252
01:09:09,290 --> 01:09:13,490
If people are concerned about
being separated from families,

1253
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:17,780
they should be a hell of a lot more
concerned about the war on drugs than

1254
01:09:17,781 --> 01:09:21,920
anything. Some Internet podcasts is
saying, you know as well as I do,

1255
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:25,760
how many families are smashed
up by the war on drugs, right?

1256
01:09:25,761 --> 01:09:29,390
So if somebody is for the war on drugs
than they are for people getting ripped

1257
01:09:29,391 --> 01:09:33,200
out of their homes, separated from
their children, thrown in prison,

1258
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:37,850
that smashes up families.
If people are for family cohesion,

1259
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:40,700
which you know, I'm married,
I have a child and love it.

1260
01:09:41,090 --> 01:09:42,830
If there for family cohesion,

1261
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:46,520
they should be against the
military industrial complex,

1262
01:09:46,730 --> 01:09:50,480
which separates people from their
families, sends them overseas,

1263
01:09:50,510 --> 01:09:52,370
guests them traumatized,
has them come back,

1264
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:56,210
dumps them back in with very little
support into society as a whole.

1265
01:09:56,690 --> 01:09:59,750
If people are very much
into family cohesion,

1266
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:05,200
then forcing parents to pay for government
schools where parents and children

1267
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:07,790
are separated from each other
for seven or eight hours a day,

1268
01:10:08,150 --> 01:10:09,560
that is a significant issue.

1269
01:10:09,561 --> 01:10:13,430
So I'm sort of a little baffled
sometimes when people say,

1270
01:10:14,150 --> 01:10:15,440
when I, when I say, look,

1271
01:10:15,441 --> 01:10:18,020
if you're going to take a
committed stand on a moral issue,

1272
01:10:18,410 --> 01:10:21,170
at some point your personal relationships
are going to have to become part of

1273
01:10:21,171 --> 01:10:22,790
that equation.
If you now,

1274
01:10:22,791 --> 01:10:25,070
if you don't want to take a
committed stand on a moral issue,

1275
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:27,290
that's perfectly fine and I said
that right there in the video,

1276
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:30,620
you know if then den and
give up this philosophy,

1277
01:10:30,621 --> 01:10:33,920
if if you want to keep your
relationships that's perfectly fine,

1278
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:37,580
but if you do want to take
a moral stand on an issue,

1279
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:41,270
then at some point your personal
relationships are going to be part of the

1280
01:10:41,271 --> 01:10:43,910
equation. Otherwise you're kind of
a hypocrite, right? You're saying,

1281
01:10:43,911 --> 01:10:46,340
well this is non aggression
principle is really important to me,

1282
01:10:46,610 --> 01:10:49,850
but all the people who want me thrown
in jail for following my conscience,

1283
01:10:49,851 --> 01:10:50,870
well that's okay,

1284
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:55,980
but do they want you thrown in jail
just by simply saying that they re they

1285
01:10:55,990 --> 01:10:59,700
support quote unquote the state?
Is that what they're saying?

1286
01:10:59,701 --> 01:11:02,070
Or they're saying that they want you in
jail. They don't want you breaking laws.

1287
01:11:02,071 --> 01:11:03,630
But did they want you in jail?
I mean,

1288
01:11:03,631 --> 01:11:06,390
are they saying they really want you
dead or are they saying that they,

1289
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:10,170
they don't think that it's the worst
situation ever to have a government?

1290
01:11:10,550 --> 01:11:13,590
Well, no, but you see again in
this, the clip that you, I said,

1291
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:16,890
I've talked to [inaudible]. I said, when
you sit down with that person, you say,

1292
01:11:16,891 --> 01:11:19,260
I've talked about this
for years, right? Right.

1293
01:11:20,310 --> 01:11:24,120
So at some point people do have to get
down to the essence of what's being

1294
01:11:24,121 --> 01:11:26,910
talked about when we talk about the
state and what is being talked about

1295
01:11:26,911 --> 01:11:29,280
fundamentally in essence
is the initiation of force.

1296
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:35,370
It is the only agency in society that
is able to initiate the use of force and

1297
01:11:35,671 --> 01:11:38,190
do that, which is illegal
for private citizens to do.

1298
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:44,700
And that is a great and deep and I
argue terrible power in the world.

1299
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:45,993
It gets like,

1300
01:11:47,030 --> 01:11:47,650
yeah,

1301
01:11:47,650 --> 01:11:49,090
if I was erm,

1302
01:11:53,780 --> 01:11:57,860
I don't mean to push and pull the j Chi,
but let's just say the j card,

1303
01:11:57,890 --> 01:12:01,700
the Jewish. Right. So,
but let's say that, um,

1304
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:05,870
uh, I don't think anybody's
ever said that somebody was a,

1305
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:10,960
somebody was talking about I'm a
Holocaust is not a big deal or who cares.

1306
01:12:11,121 --> 01:12:15,080
Right. And I this is an extreme example
and it's, I mean obviously it's, it's um,

1307
01:12:15,530 --> 01:12:16,363
contentious.
But

1308
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:17,830
yeah,

1309
01:12:17,830 --> 01:12:21,590
at some point if somebody was
a holocaust denier and, uh, uh,

1310
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:24,670
I would at some point have to say, look,
I mean this is really not acceptable.

1311
01:12:24,671 --> 01:12:28,470
I mean we can't write or I can say,
well, I'm not, you know, for reality,

1312
01:12:28,471 --> 01:12:30,310
your true for Judaism or
anything like that anymore.

1313
01:12:31,510 --> 01:12:34,570
That is the reality of having a
committed moral principle. If,

1314
01:12:34,630 --> 01:12:39,370
if you are in the 18th century and you
are for the end of slavery and everyone

1315
01:12:39,371 --> 01:12:40,150
around you is like,

1316
01:12:40,150 --> 01:12:43,840
I think slavery is unnecessary and
moral institution and you had years of

1317
01:12:43,841 --> 01:12:47,320
conversation with them about the moral
reality and you've shown them the

1318
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:49,840
pictures.
In the 20th century alone,

1319
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:54,310
Joe governments murdered a
quarter of a billion human beings,

1320
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:59,320
not including war,
a quarter of a billion human beings.

1321
01:12:59,321 --> 01:13:02,890
250 million human beings were murdered
by governments. In the 20th century.

1322
01:13:03,130 --> 01:13:06,850
That is some serious shit
that goes down that is like,

1323
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:08,770
I don't even know how many Holocaust.
Right?

1324
01:13:10,030 --> 01:13:12,370
And so people who support the state,

1325
01:13:12,371 --> 01:13:14,960
and I'm talking about after
years of conversation, right?

1326
01:13:14,961 --> 01:13:17,320
Because it takes a long time
to change these paradigms,

1327
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:21,520
but at some point if you are
committed to a moral goal,

1328
01:13:22,570 --> 01:13:27,570
then people who are happy or comfortable
or positive or pro the initiation of

1329
01:13:29,441 --> 01:13:31,600
force against you in
pursuit of that moral goal.

1330
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:35,530
I think that I cannot have people
in my life who are going to,

1331
01:13:35,531 --> 01:13:38,890
after I have explained it and after they
have agreed with the general principles,

1332
01:13:38,891 --> 01:13:42,070
as I said in the, uh, the
clip that you just played,

1333
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:43,870
I can't have those people in my life.

1334
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:48,490
I can't have people in my life who at
want me thrown in jail for following my

1335
01:13:48,491 --> 01:13:49,170
conscience.

1336
01:13:49,170 --> 01:13:50,700
When you say support the state,

1337
01:13:51,210 --> 01:13:53,550
you don't want people in your
life to support the site.

1338
01:13:53,580 --> 01:13:55,260
To what end do they dissent?

1339
01:13:55,440 --> 01:14:00,120
I mean saying you don't agree with war
is fairly commonplace yet there's war

1340
01:14:00,121 --> 01:14:03,600
everywhere saying you don't
agree with taxes. Pretty much.

1341
01:14:03,601 --> 01:14:06,240
Most Americans don't agree
with the current tax structure,

1342
01:14:06,241 --> 01:14:10,080
but what are the options? I mean by
saying you don't agree with them,

1343
01:14:10,081 --> 01:14:12,040
that's all you require or do you require

1344
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:16,810
action like by saying you don't
support the state, nothing gets done.

1345
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:18,970
There's nothing different.
If you don't pay your taxes,

1346
01:14:18,971 --> 01:14:22,270
you will get thrown in jail.
You will get in trouble.

1347
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:25,240
And what happens if you resist?
You get thrown in jail.

1348
01:14:25,270 --> 01:14:28,030
What happens if you resist the people
who come to throw you in jail probably

1349
01:14:28,031 --> 01:14:32,500
shoot you. That's what I'm talking about.
No ones. Even if you don't support that,

1350
01:14:32,860 --> 01:14:34,180
like what do you do?

1351
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:39,430
What do the doing pot well that's doing
everything because otherwise you're just

1352
01:14:39,431 --> 01:14:42,580
saying you don't support it but
you are supporting it. Right.

1353
01:14:42,790 --> 01:14:46,540
You know by saying do you support the
state? If you send in your tax dollars,

1354
01:14:46,541 --> 01:14:49,360
you support the state. If you follow
the laws, you do support the state.

1355
01:14:50,410 --> 01:14:54,070
I mean you are essentially, yeah. No,
I mean they're bidding but that's the,

1356
01:14:54,130 --> 01:14:58,270
I think that's using the, you know,
if, if a slave doesn't run away,

1357
01:14:58,271 --> 01:15:01,150
he doesn't support slavery.
Reminisce recognizes who has the whip.

1358
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:04,540
But if you're saying that you're going
to cut people out of your life that

1359
01:15:04,541 --> 01:15:08,740
support the state, to what extent do you
have to not support the state? I mean,

1360
01:15:08,741 --> 01:15:10,930
what if you're paying taxes,
you're supporting the state.

1361
01:15:10,931 --> 01:15:13,390
If you're following the laws,
you're essentially supporting the state.

1362
01:15:13,391 --> 01:15:16,810
You're falling laws that you don't agree
with, right? Like when someone says,

1363
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:20,010
I don't support the state, what the fuck
does that even mean? I mean, come on Joe.

1364
01:15:20,050 --> 01:15:24,100
I mean someone who's in a concentration
camp is not supporting the regime even

1365
01:15:24,101 --> 01:15:24,970
if they're not fighting it.

1366
01:15:25,150 --> 01:15:29,300
So are we all in a concentration
camp just paying the tax?

1367
01:15:29,301 --> 01:15:32,080
I'm analogizing that obedience
to force is not supported.

1368
01:15:32,081 --> 01:15:35,660
I understand that of force, right? I
pay my taxes, I obey all the law. Right?

1369
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:38,410
But then the descent of
though that obedience,

1370
01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:43,830
the disallowing of the state or the
disapproving rather of the state.

1371
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:47,830
Like what? To what extent do you
require to maintain a friendship?

1372
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:51,400
All I all I require for
friendships with me.

1373
01:15:51,401 --> 01:15:53,320
All they require is for somebody to say,

1374
01:15:53,650 --> 01:15:57,400
I do not support the use of force against
you for a piece of, of activities.

1375
01:15:57,401 --> 01:15:59,680
That's all I require.
They don't have to do anything.

1376
01:15:59,681 --> 01:16:01,630
They don't have to join a march.

1377
01:16:01,631 --> 01:16:03,820
They don't have to chain
themselves to an IRS officer,

1378
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:07,150
haven't anything like that.
All I require is for people to say,

1379
01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:10,120
I do not want you shot for
following your conscience.

1380
01:16:10,210 --> 01:16:13,870
I reject the use of force against you
for peaceful activities. That's it.

1381
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:17,200
That's the magic key to the Kingdom
of me. Well, that, that's all very,

1382
01:16:17,201 --> 01:16:21,880
very reasonable. And in saying
that, but also saying that you,

1383
01:16:22,370 --> 01:16:26,800
you also are following the laws,
you're still sort of supporting the state,

1384
01:16:26,801 --> 01:16:30,640
aren't you? Yeah. Again, we're
back to this question of support.

1385
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:34,460
I don't think that enforced compliance
could be considered since support.

1386
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:35,890
Otherwise, you know? Right.

1387
01:16:35,891 --> 01:16:38,410
There's no such thing as rape because
if the woman's not fighting back, right.

1388
01:16:38,411 --> 01:16:41,650
Obviously it's, you know, a
terrible situation. So now I just,

1389
01:16:41,651 --> 01:16:45,880
all I requires for people
to say it is coercion and I,

1390
01:16:46,130 --> 01:16:49,900
I think it's wrong that that's all.
I mean nobody has to do anything. Uh,

1391
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:53,890
because I think that once
everybody gets that, then

1392
01:16:57,040 --> 01:17:01,210
evil is a very tough thing to fight
because most people like once,

1393
01:17:01,211 --> 01:17:04,980
once someone identify something as
evil, it's usually done. Like what?

1394
01:17:04,981 --> 01:17:08,470
Once immorality is clear to people,
it's usually over and done with.

1395
01:17:08,471 --> 01:17:10,160
Like that's why nobody says let's

1396
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:13,550
get bring back slavery because everybody
recognizes what a social immorality it

1397
01:17:13,551 --> 01:17:17,630
is. So it has no power, which had
huge power throughout most of history.

1398
01:17:18,110 --> 01:17:22,460
Slavery now has no power all let's say,
let's take away the rights of women.

1399
01:17:22,490 --> 01:17:24,440
Now nobody suggests that
cause it would be wrong,

1400
01:17:24,530 --> 01:17:27,740
but it was format a lot of history.
That was how a lot of societies function.

1401
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:30,770
So once people see
immorality for what it is,

1402
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:34,430
it loses all of its power and
society fundamentally changes.

1403
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:37,670
That's why all I want is for people to
see what I call the gun in the room.

1404
01:17:37,940 --> 01:17:39,470
That when people are
talking about the state,

1405
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:43,550
they are at the bottom talking about
the use of violence in the initiation of

1406
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:45,950
violence. When people, if people see that,

1407
01:17:47,210 --> 01:17:48,830
then that is,

1408
01:17:48,831 --> 01:17:52,520
I think that and peaceful parenting
is the very best way to bring about a

1409
01:17:52,521 --> 01:17:55,730
peaceful change. Revolution suck. I mean,

1410
01:17:56,270 --> 01:17:59,280
I think maybe three times in human history
they ended up with something better

1411
01:17:59,281 --> 01:18:02,000
and most times it's
just terrible. And, um,

1412
01:18:02,030 --> 01:18:05,780
and of course most people who do follow
the state follow the state just as I did

1413
01:18:05,781 --> 01:18:08,990
and, and prove approve of and appraisal
state because that's how they're raised.

1414
01:18:08,991 --> 01:18:12,650
And that's, you know, so it takes years
of conversations to change people's minds.

1415
01:18:12,890 --> 01:18:14,660
But at some point, you know, again,

1416
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:18,440
committed to all people have to say is
they reject the use of force against me.

1417
01:18:18,470 --> 01:18:22,130
And um, that's great. Yeah.

1418
01:18:22,570 --> 01:18:27,570
I think that the issue that people have
with it is this is the stern stance of

1419
01:18:28,241 --> 01:18:29,620
cutting folks out of your life.

1420
01:18:29,650 --> 01:18:33,340
I mean that seems to come up over and
over again in the criticisms of you is

1421
01:18:33,341 --> 01:18:36,070
this idea of cutting family
members out of your life,

1422
01:18:36,340 --> 01:18:39,370
cutting your parents out of
your life. And that, you know,

1423
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:43,780
even people that have thought that
they had happy relationships with their

1424
01:18:43,781 --> 01:18:44,530
family,

1425
01:18:44,530 --> 01:18:47,560
you don't believe they're
happy relationships and you
don't believe that these,

1426
01:18:47,650 --> 01:18:49,190
these people,
you,

1427
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:53,380
you essentially have talked
about childhood in a lot
of folks as being like a

1428
01:18:53,381 --> 01:18:54,214
prison.

1429
01:18:54,790 --> 01:18:58,600
Well, I mean technically it kind of here's
my daughter can't, can't go anywhere.

1430
01:18:58,601 --> 01:19:00,250
It's not wrong. It's just that, you know,

1431
01:19:00,251 --> 01:19:03,400
she's completely dependent
on me and she has no rights.

1432
01:19:03,401 --> 01:19:05,370
She has no economic
independence and someone,

1433
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:08,530
so that's more a biological
description of dependence rather than,

1434
01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:10,600
it's terrible like a government prison.

1435
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:13,510
Hmm. Yeah. I don't think I would
ever describe it as a prison.

1436
01:19:14,140 --> 01:19:19,140
I think I would more describe it as
someone developing and more of like,

1437
01:19:20,310 --> 01:19:20,740
you know,

1438
01:19:20,740 --> 01:19:25,030
a scenario where you're mentoring and
raising them and protecting them and then

1439
01:19:25,031 --> 01:19:26,940
slowly nurturing them
to the point with her

1440
01:19:27,140 --> 01:19:30,070
pendant. Yeah. I mean, I
considered that prison. No.

1441
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:34,130
And I can't remember if and where and
when I've said anything like that.

1442
01:19:34,131 --> 01:19:36,460
But I mean I obviously I'm a parent and,

1443
01:19:36,461 --> 01:19:39,640
and I'd been a stay at home parent
for five and a half years now.

1444
01:19:39,641 --> 01:19:40,330
And you've caught

1445
01:19:40,330 --> 01:19:44,020
parents out, your wife has cut
her parents out and you've,

1446
01:19:44,270 --> 01:19:46,390
you've recommended this
to many other folks.

1447
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:49,790
No, no, no, no, no, no. I haven't.
No, I didn't recommend it in that.

1448
01:19:49,791 --> 01:19:53,270
I say there are consequences to
holding certain beliefs. Right?

1449
01:19:53,420 --> 01:19:56,840
And if you want to keep people in your
life who had destructive towards you,

1450
01:19:56,841 --> 01:19:59,600
that's absolutely your choice. But then
don't say you're against destruction.

1451
01:19:59,630 --> 01:20:03,470
That's all. If you want
to keep, and this is, um,

1452
01:20:03,530 --> 01:20:05,180
the consequences of beliefs.
I've really,

1453
01:20:05,181 --> 01:20:07,040
really want people to
take philosophy seriously.

1454
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:09,840
Don't want it to be like
a dilettante's science.

1455
01:20:09,841 --> 01:20:14,340
I don't want it to be a a or habit.
I mean, when you hold moral beliefs,

1456
01:20:14,341 --> 01:20:16,290
they have very serious,
very, very important.

1457
01:20:16,291 --> 01:20:19,380
And that's how things change in the world
is people who take their moral beliefs

1458
01:20:19,381 --> 01:20:23,670
incredibly seriously and are willing to
go to the wall for them. Yeah. Right?

1459
01:20:23,910 --> 01:20:27,170
And so if you hold
moral beliefs, then, um,

1460
01:20:27,930 --> 01:20:31,410
they have to inform your relationships.
Otherwise, it's pretty hypocritical. Now,

1461
01:20:31,890 --> 01:20:33,380
if you want to hang
onto your relationships,

1462
01:20:33,390 --> 01:20:35,250
as I've said millions of times before,
fantastic,

1463
01:20:35,251 --> 01:20:38,460
then recognize that you don't really
hold those beliefs. That's fine.

1464
01:20:39,370 --> 01:20:43,440
No one can tell anyone what to do in
that regard. But if you hold the beliefs,

1465
01:20:43,441 --> 01:20:47,880
they have consequences in your life.
Otherwise they're just noise.

1466
01:20:47,881 --> 01:20:48,714
They're just talk.

1467
01:20:48,770 --> 01:20:53,060
So essentially what you're saying
is that your idealistic view,

1468
01:20:53,061 --> 01:20:57,290
your Utopian view must
be in somehow acted upon.

1469
01:20:57,500 --> 01:21:01,940
And that if you have this idea of what
is correct, what is morally correct,

1470
01:21:01,941 --> 01:21:05,690
what is ethically correct, what is
the, the best way to live your life?

1471
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:09,680
If there are any impediments to that,
that you're enforcing or even nurturing,

1472
01:21:09,681 --> 01:21:13,880
you need to remove them from your life?
The impediments to progress.

1473
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:19,040
I think there's, there's, there's,
there's a certain amount of real,

1474
01:21:19,940 --> 01:21:24,440
there's a certain amount of momentum
that we were raised with. Um,

1475
01:21:24,441 --> 01:21:28,130
I think many of us, I mean, I can
give you my own personal example.

1476
01:21:28,131 --> 01:21:31,640
We were raised by people who were raised
by people who really didn't know much.

1477
01:21:32,030 --> 01:21:36,810
And a lot of how we developed
and a lot of how we were,

1478
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:41,120
we're taught around the home was
by people that really didn't,

1479
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:43,250
they weren't aware of the
consequences of their actions.

1480
01:21:43,250 --> 01:21:47,360
They're essentially acting in the
momentum of how they were raised and,

1481
01:21:47,450 --> 01:21:50,870
and also what is convenient. They're
working all day, they're tired.

1482
01:21:50,990 --> 01:21:54,200
They want you to shut the fuck up. And
so they yell at you to shut the fuck up.

1483
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:58,100
And is it that they're evil or is it that
they didn't really know what the fuck

1484
01:21:58,101 --> 01:21:59,570
they were doing?
You know?

1485
01:21:59,571 --> 01:22:04,571
And I think that taking a stand to
do things differently is incredibly

1486
01:22:04,611 --> 01:22:05,240
important.

1487
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:09,080
And if you have grandparents or parents
or whatever that are destructive to the,

1488
01:22:09,650 --> 01:22:12,200
to your children,
or they give your children,

1489
01:22:12,650 --> 01:22:16,130
put bad thoughts in their heads or
teach them that what you're saying is

1490
01:22:16,131 --> 01:22:17,660
incorrect and that this,

1491
01:22:17,661 --> 01:22:20,420
these ethics and morals that you're
teaching them that you feel so strongly

1492
01:22:20,421 --> 01:22:23,150
about or in fact against the Bible,

1493
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:27,170
or I could see cutting those
types of folks out of your life.

1494
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:28,490
I honestly can see that,

1495
01:22:28,700 --> 01:22:33,700
but I think people have a problem
with you saying it because you're so

1496
01:22:34,731 --> 01:22:37,670
charismatic because you're so eloquent.

1497
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:41,240
Because when I hear someone
talk that talks better than me,

1498
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:43,550
I assume that person's smarter than me.

1499
01:22:43,820 --> 01:22:47,030
I want to listen to that person more
than one to listen to my own mind because

1500
01:22:47,031 --> 01:22:50,630
most people's minds are filled
with doubt and insecurity,

1501
01:22:50,750 --> 01:22:54,320
and it's one of the reasons why colt
cults get formed in the first place.

1502
01:22:54,530 --> 01:22:57,020
If someone can talk
clearly and confidently,

1503
01:22:57,200 --> 01:23:00,470
and I say this with all knowledge that
I've been accused of fucking starting my

1504
01:23:00,471 --> 01:23:04,190
own cult, all right, I'm not, I'm
not any sort of a leader whatsoever.

1505
01:23:04,340 --> 01:23:06,640
What I am is entirely

1506
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:08,830
a person who is curious
and who asks questions.

1507
01:23:08,831 --> 01:23:12,160
And I give advice based on
what I've learned about myself.

1508
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:16,270
And I tried to be as open and honest
about all my flaws and all the mistakes

1509
01:23:16,271 --> 01:23:19,000
that I've made totally in the,

1510
01:23:19,001 --> 01:23:22,270
in the interest of disclosure so that
other people can learn from the mistakes

1511
01:23:22,271 --> 01:23:23,950
that I've made without
having to make them yourself.

1512
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:29,410
But I think that when people hear
that this idea of cutting people off,

1513
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:34,060
d fooling as you call it, cutting
people off, it makes them nervous. Why?

1514
01:23:34,070 --> 01:23:38,770
Because that's why the polls, it's
principal directive about cults. It's not,

1515
01:23:38,830 --> 01:23:42,820
it's not, that's the why
of your life. No, no,

1516
01:23:43,570 --> 01:23:46,720
isn't it though? Listen, isn't the
thing, let me ask you this, Joe,

1517
01:23:46,750 --> 01:23:50,380
do you think that a woman
who's being abused by her
husband should stay or leave?

1518
01:23:50,410 --> 01:23:55,180
No. Stay. She should stay? No, of course.
No. She said leave. Yes, of course.

1519
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:59,920
Yes. So, um, why is it any
different between adult
children and their parents? No,

1520
01:23:59,921 --> 01:24:01,480
you're right. You know,
if your parents abuse you,

1521
01:24:01,481 --> 01:24:05,530
I absolutely 100% whole heartedly agree.
If you had an abusive asshole parents,

1522
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:08,620
you should cut them off. And
furthermore, I strongly suggest,

1523
01:24:08,650 --> 01:24:12,490
and I've been to therapy myself and I
think it's a wonderful discipline. Uh,

1524
01:24:12,491 --> 01:24:15,490
if you get a great therapist,
I have consistently said,

1525
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:19,510
if you have problems with your parents,
sit down with them and talk about them.

1526
01:24:19,690 --> 01:24:21,550
Screw the philosophy,
screw this. You know,

1527
01:24:21,551 --> 01:24:24,790
all this other stuff we've been talking
about the state and so on, right?

1528
01:24:25,030 --> 01:24:27,370
If you have issues with your parents,

1529
01:24:27,371 --> 01:24:30,730
like if they beat you up or if they
never paid any attention to you,

1530
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:35,940
sit down and talk with them and air
your grievances because you have to be

1531
01:24:36,341 --> 01:24:38,620
honest in relationships.
If you're going to have a relationship,

1532
01:24:38,710 --> 01:24:41,350
I agree and have conversations
with them and talk with them.

1533
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:43,450
If the abuse escalates,
if it gets worse,

1534
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:46,870
try and continue to have the conversation
until you just can't take it anymore.

1535
01:24:47,050 --> 01:24:50,950
If you're considering family
separation, talk to a therapist. It's,

1536
01:24:50,970 --> 01:24:53,980
and don't do it without a therapist
has been my consistent mantra for eight

1537
01:24:53,981 --> 01:24:56,300
years. Go Talk to a therapist, uh, and,

1538
01:24:56,301 --> 01:24:59,260
and make sure a therapist reviews
the whole situation with you,

1539
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:01,120
goes with you through the whole process.

1540
01:25:01,510 --> 01:25:04,150
Now that's a heck of a lot more than
women who are being abused by their

1541
01:25:04,151 --> 01:25:07,870
husbands usually get in terms
of advice, right? But, um,

1542
01:25:08,260 --> 01:25:09,940
as far as I know, it, uh,

1543
01:25:09,970 --> 01:25:13,540
the people who have left their families
have done so under the care of a

1544
01:25:13,541 --> 01:25:14,081
therapist,

1545
01:25:14,081 --> 01:25:17,710
which I think is really essential and
important because it is a challenging

1546
01:25:17,711 --> 01:25:20,830
thing to do. And Fss said at the
beginning of the show, I mean,

1547
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:25,000
it's all about principles. It's all
about the extension of principles.

1548
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:29,740
Women who were abused by their husbands
chose those relationships for bad

1549
01:25:29,741 --> 01:25:30,461
reasons,
obviously,

1550
01:25:30,461 --> 01:25:33,040
and probably for own personal histories
of abuse as children and so on.

1551
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:37,720
Women who chose their husbands are in
those relationships voluntarily and can

1552
01:25:37,721 --> 01:25:41,860
leave at any time and have massive support
systems around in the world to leave.

1553
01:25:42,190 --> 01:25:45,460
Now when you're a child, you really
can't leave your parents, right? I mean,

1554
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:46,100
that's why I was,

1555
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:49,630
I think half jokingly referred to it as
like a prison because you can't leave.

1556
01:25:49,990 --> 01:25:52,270
You can't get out.
Now,

1557
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:57,100
if you were abused by your parents when
you're a child, you couldn't leave.

1558
01:25:57,580 --> 01:26:00,340
You couldn't get out. I mean,
where are you going to go?

1559
01:26:01,180 --> 01:26:05,810
And so then you become an adult and
the behavior has not reformed and the

1560
01:26:05,811 --> 01:26:08,660
parents are still negative or
difficult or abusive. Absolutely.

1561
01:26:08,661 --> 01:26:11,720
Sit down and air your grievances with
them. If they continue to be abusive,

1562
01:26:11,721 --> 01:26:12,560
you don't have to stay.

1563
01:26:12,930 --> 01:26:16,770
Well, how do you define abuse of
though what? What is abusive? I mean,

1564
01:26:16,771 --> 01:26:19,410
there's a broad range of
many would consider abusive.

1565
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:23,220
There are, um, so, uh,

1566
01:26:23,990 --> 01:26:25,530
minor little pitch here.
Um,

1567
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:29,780
the FDR [inaudible] dot com slash bib
is my presentation on the bomb in the

1568
01:26:29,781 --> 01:26:32,540
brain where I go through what's called
the adverse childhood experiences,

1569
01:26:32,541 --> 01:26:36,800
which is a test developed by Dr. Vincent
Felitti, who's also been on my show.

1570
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:40,940
And I think it's a nine or 11 part
questionnaire about things that you

1571
01:26:40,941 --> 01:26:45,470
experienced as a child that are
considered to be a abusive, uh,

1572
01:26:45,530 --> 01:26:47,190
so being beaten,
uh,

1573
01:26:47,210 --> 01:26:51,100
not receiving proper medical
care or food or shelter, um,

1574
01:26:51,140 --> 01:26:54,890
and living with a family member who was
incarcerated or mentally ill or addicted

1575
01:26:54,891 --> 01:26:57,980
to various substances and so on. So, um,

1576
01:26:58,040 --> 01:27:01,480
there is a pretty objective
questions out there. You know,

1577
01:27:01,490 --> 01:27:04,280
how comprehensive I didn't develop them.
I haven't,

1578
01:27:04,281 --> 01:27:07,970
obviously you vetted them compared to
what I don't do. Excuse me. I don't know.

1579
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:11,960
But there are sort of standards out there
by which people can sort of find out

1580
01:27:11,961 --> 01:27:15,470
to some degree whether or not they have,
uh, uh, experienced abuse as a child.

1581
01:27:16,310 --> 01:27:20,390
This, but this practice of
[inaudible], um, this is, I mean,

1582
01:27:20,420 --> 01:27:23,720
it's pretty widely criticized, right? I
mean, your wife got in trouble for this,

1583
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:28,550
for advocating this on your, on your
show, right? No, she didn't. No,

1584
01:27:29,100 --> 01:27:32,510
didn't, she gets suspended and
she'd have no, none of that is true.

1585
01:27:33,050 --> 01:27:35,230
So that's just lies she online.

1586
01:27:35,410 --> 01:27:39,070
Yeah. None of it. That is true. She was
never suspended, have practice continued.

1587
01:27:39,071 --> 01:27:42,190
They had some questions about the podcast
and in the end of it they said, listen,

1588
01:27:42,490 --> 01:27:46,600
we thought that maybe you had been
given advice without giving a full, um,

1589
01:27:47,020 --> 01:27:49,360
uh,
psychological question or workup.

1590
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:54,950
The quote that I had wrote and written
down was that she had been told her

1591
01:27:54,951 --> 01:27:56,710
statements are in,
uh,

1592
01:27:57,470 --> 01:28:02,130
in support of deferring or not
supported by current professional now or

1593
01:28:02,131 --> 01:28:03,650
consistent with a,

1594
01:28:03,890 --> 01:28:05,360
that was in the complaints.

1595
01:28:05,390 --> 01:28:09,680
The final result was that a defunding
is perfectly consistent with best

1596
01:28:09,681 --> 01:28:10,730
psychological practices.

1597
01:28:11,070 --> 01:28:14,910
So this was just in the complaint.
So people are taking this out of context.

1598
01:28:14,911 --> 01:28:17,760
Can you believe it?
Something that it's being taken well,

1599
01:28:17,761 --> 01:28:21,880
that's very illuminating, then that
makes people feel a lot better. Um,

1600
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:24,320
because that,
that,

1601
01:28:24,330 --> 01:28:29,280
that mean that is the one thing that
people consistently have issue with a lot

1602
01:28:29,281 --> 01:28:32,430
of the teachings of you and your,

1603
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:37,460
well, let's, let's look at it this
way. Right? So in, in the 60s,

1604
01:28:37,490 --> 01:28:41,030
I'm sorry to drop it. In the 60s, there
was, I mean, it's great. I'm really,

1605
01:28:41,031 --> 01:28:43,160
I appreciate you bringing
all this stuff up. I mean,

1606
01:28:44,170 --> 01:28:47,300
because it's interesting stuff. So, um,

1607
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:50,090
in the 1960s,
uh,

1608
01:28:50,210 --> 01:28:53,780
feminists and I think really great
feminists came along and said to women,

1609
01:28:53,781 --> 01:28:58,380
don't put up with abuse. Right? I had
this, a woman on my show, she's a, uh,

1610
01:28:58,580 --> 01:29:03,420
Aaron [inaudible] or she, she created
the a woman's shelter, uh, in, in England

1611
01:29:05,370 --> 01:29:10,370
and women would come beaten up
and broken down to her shelter.

1612
01:29:11,490 --> 01:29:14,160
And everybody was appalled.

1613
01:29:14,610 --> 01:29:19,240
Absolutely appalled until death do
us part was the mantra, right? Uh,

1614
01:29:19,260 --> 01:29:22,470
that you can't leave your
husband no matter how abusive,
no matter how terrible,

1615
01:29:22,471 --> 01:29:25,170
no matter how drunk and no
matter how, what effort. Right.

1616
01:29:26,240 --> 01:29:26,650
Okay.

1617
01:29:26,650 --> 01:29:29,230
And she basically said, well,
I don't think that's right.

1618
01:29:29,260 --> 01:29:32,260
I think that you should not stay
in abusive relationships. Now,

1619
01:29:32,290 --> 01:29:35,200
if the only people you ever
talked to with the husbands,

1620
01:29:36,430 --> 01:29:38,260
the abusive husbands that
these women had left,

1621
01:29:38,261 --> 01:29:42,160
what would they say about this
woman? Yeah, no, I see your point.

1622
01:29:42,940 --> 01:29:43,780
It's not the children,

1623
01:29:44,050 --> 01:29:47,860
it's not the adult children who are
complaining about this. It's the parents.

1624
01:29:49,150 --> 01:29:50,920
Well, my mom, what you, I
mean, what would you expect?

1625
01:29:52,550 --> 01:29:56,870
I mean if you promote volunteerism in
relationships and then people go to a

1626
01:29:56,871 --> 01:30:00,210
therapist and um, you know, like I was a,

1627
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:04,130
I think I kind of hope 2000 and
whatever it was years and years ago,

1628
01:30:04,550 --> 01:30:09,020
there was some write up in the newspapers,
a about some guy who left his family.

1629
01:30:09,710 --> 01:30:11,150
He was a therapist,

1630
01:30:11,151 --> 01:30:14,120
was helping him through the whole process
and the therapist was recommending it

1631
01:30:14,121 --> 01:30:17,390
and the therapist was the one who
was helping him through the process.

1632
01:30:17,391 --> 01:30:21,590
But somehow it's the podcast in Canada
that is the sole cause of all this stuff.

1633
01:30:22,010 --> 01:30:25,520
Well, I certainly think there's arguments
for cutting people out of your life,

1634
01:30:25,550 --> 01:30:29,330
whether it's a fee, a sister or
a brother or a mother or father,

1635
01:30:29,331 --> 01:30:34,331
they are abusive people that you are
unfortunately just given a relationship

1636
01:30:35,841 --> 01:30:38,450
with. You don't choose them. They
are just a part of your life.

1637
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:43,840
And I think it certainly can be argued
that an engineered life where you choose

1638
01:30:43,971 --> 01:30:45,260
the people in your life,

1639
01:30:45,261 --> 01:30:48,440
when you choose the positive influences
that you have can be more rewarding,

1640
01:30:48,441 --> 01:30:49,310
more satisfying,

1641
01:30:49,311 --> 01:30:53,780
more beneficial than being committed
to this blood is thicker than water

1642
01:30:53,781 --> 01:30:56,900
bullshit where you have a bunch of people
in your life that are fucking assholes.

1643
01:30:57,380 --> 01:30:58,610
Um,
I think that

1644
01:30:59,780 --> 01:31:04,780
in illuminating it like this and speaking
about it in this sort of a form where

1645
01:31:05,121 --> 01:31:06,950
you get a chance to go back
and forth with someone,

1646
01:31:06,951 --> 01:31:10,700
people will get a better idea of your
point of view and your perspective on it.

1647
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:15,290
And it's really easy to look at
what you've said and say, oh,

1648
01:31:15,291 --> 01:31:19,370
this guy's fucking starting a call. This
guy's telling people, cut everybody out.

1649
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:22,460
If you don't, if you support the
state, cut them out of your life.

1650
01:31:22,670 --> 01:31:26,030
Cut everybody out. If, uh, if
you, if your mom, you know,

1651
01:31:26,031 --> 01:31:28,330
yelled at you to do your
homework and called you a loser,

1652
01:31:28,340 --> 01:31:32,120
cut her out of your life. Everybody cut
out. Come to me, send me your money.

1653
01:31:32,270 --> 01:31:36,740
Get in my inner circle. I need about 50
bucks a month come to come to my house.

1654
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:40,190
We're going to have POW wows when I
sit around the campfire and I'll wax

1655
01:31:40,191 --> 01:31:41,990
eloquently while you all stare and

1656
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:43,360
I,
uh,

1657
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:48,100
I will give you access to the basement
of fertile women and then everything will

1658
01:31:48,160 --> 01:31:51,280
be set there in the basement. Yeah.
No, I mean, look, it's a podcast.

1659
01:31:51,290 --> 01:31:54,140
I'm making arguments, right? Every
philosopher throughout history,

1660
01:31:54,141 --> 01:31:56,300
and I'm not trying to put myself
in such illustrious company,

1661
01:31:56,301 --> 01:32:00,340
but every philosopher throughout history
has accused of corrupting the young,

1662
01:32:00,820 --> 01:32:02,950
right? I mean, that's, if
you're not accused of that,

1663
01:32:02,951 --> 01:32:06,690
you're just not even in the
remotely. Right. You're not
trying hard enough. Yeah.

1664
01:32:06,700 --> 01:32:08,260
You're just not,
not doing hard labor.

1665
01:32:08,310 --> 01:32:13,020
Zero lazy philosopher and, um, well,
it's, sorry, go ahead. No, I'm sorry.

1666
01:32:13,021 --> 01:32:15,300
It was just, there is, without a doubt,

1667
01:32:15,810 --> 01:32:20,810
there's problems with the society at
large and many of the problems are because

1668
01:32:21,270 --> 01:32:24,900
it has not been engineered in a,
a very

1669
01:32:27,060 --> 01:32:28,770
ethical or moral way.

1670
01:32:28,771 --> 01:32:32,130
It's been engineered out of convenience
and it's been engineered out of momentum.

1671
01:32:32,131 --> 01:32:34,590
It's been engineered by the
ignorance of the past. That's it.

1672
01:32:34,670 --> 01:32:37,430
It's just history. It's industry,
right? It's just what we've inherited.

1673
01:32:37,550 --> 01:32:40,200
[inaudible] we've got this
brain that's like, you know,

1674
01:32:40,220 --> 01:32:43,330
it's like the lizard bit and then there's
like a bit above the list or if that's

1675
01:32:43,340 --> 01:32:46,610
an amphibian and then we've got this
monkey and now we're trying to operate on

1676
01:32:46,611 --> 01:32:50,720
this like post monkey Beta expansion
pack of the frontal Cortex,

1677
01:32:51,020 --> 01:32:54,410
which is all layered on crap and it's,
you know, it's kind of unwieldy. We,

1678
01:32:54,411 --> 01:32:54,681
you know,

1679
01:32:54,681 --> 01:32:57,800
we evolved from some pretty primitive
lifeforms and it's not like that stuff's

1680
01:32:57,801 --> 01:32:59,560
all vanished,
which is actually quite a good thing then.

1681
01:32:59,730 --> 01:33:04,080
Well all these discussions and these
conversations in these heated debates,

1682
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:08,520
what they essentially do is they bring
up very important points and they allow

1683
01:33:08,521 --> 01:33:12,690
people to give opinions and
bounce ideas back and forth.

1684
01:33:12,930 --> 01:33:13,980
And that's very important.

1685
01:33:13,981 --> 01:33:18,981
And that's one of the major things that
society benefits from when it comes to

1686
01:33:20,731 --> 01:33:21,564
philosophy.

1687
01:33:22,030 --> 01:33:22,301
Well,

1688
01:33:22,301 --> 01:33:27,280
I certainly hope that is the case and I'm
very much into a consistency and I was

1689
01:33:27,281 --> 01:33:30,220
raised that if you're in abusive
relationships, you should leave them.

1690
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:33,310
That's how I was raised.
I mean because I saw that all the time.

1691
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:35,800
You know the movie of the week,
the woman in peril,

1692
01:33:35,801 --> 01:33:37,960
the husband is a creep
and and she just gets out.

1693
01:33:38,270 --> 01:33:40,820
Why do you think there's been
this blow back against you then?

1694
01:33:40,850 --> 01:33:43,850
Why do you think people take
these clips out of context?

1695
01:33:43,851 --> 01:33:45,620
Put them up and make it look like?

1696
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:49,760
Like I've always talked about like I
guess jokes are very different because it

1697
01:33:49,761 --> 01:33:53,060
should be inherently known that when
someone's joking that most likely they

1698
01:33:53,061 --> 01:33:56,120
aren't serious,
but people love to take someones jokes,

1699
01:33:57,050 --> 01:34:02,050
take the words in quotes on and put
them down in text form completely out of

1700
01:34:02,121 --> 01:34:02,900
context.

1701
01:34:02,900 --> 01:34:05,750
And some of the things that people say
look absolutely horrible because of that

1702
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:09,200
and that that's not exactly
what they're doing with you,

1703
01:34:09,230 --> 01:34:11,590
but they're doing their,

1704
01:34:11,591 --> 01:34:16,190
they're trying to label you in a
certain way and trying to label you as a

1705
01:34:16,191 --> 01:34:19,280
destructive influence. Why
do you think that is? Well,

1706
01:34:19,281 --> 01:34:22,760
I think I am at destructive implements
to them, to their interests,

1707
01:34:23,510 --> 01:34:27,470
but is it the interest of who is the
interest of the state interest of the

1708
01:34:27,471 --> 01:34:30,460
family? A lot of these folks are
not, they don't care about me.

1709
01:34:30,530 --> 01:34:32,630
You don't know what I'm saying?
A lot of these folks, they might,

1710
01:34:32,631 --> 01:34:36,530
if you keep getting bigger,
see, we'll see. It'll be happy.

1711
01:34:36,531 --> 01:34:39,230
One day of the state cares about you.
You've made it. Oh yeah, that's right.

1712
01:34:39,710 --> 01:34:44,370
Hey look, Lazarus. Yay. I the ride.
I've arrived, I'm sweating. Um,

1713
01:34:44,630 --> 01:34:45,351
but what,

1714
01:34:45,351 --> 01:34:49,310
why do you think that these folks who've
left and start these blogs against you

1715
01:34:49,311 --> 01:34:51,860
and all this nonsense? Like what
or where she didn't say nonsense,

1716
01:34:51,861 --> 01:34:54,350
all this criticism.
What do you think that's about?

1717
01:34:55,340 --> 01:34:56,810
Well, I think that, um,

1718
01:34:56,870 --> 01:35:01,870
the of volunteerism in any relationship
harms the interest of those who are

1719
01:35:02,691 --> 01:35:06,290
relying on things other than volunteerism.
God, that's a bad way of putting it.

1720
01:35:06,291 --> 01:35:10,940
Does that even make any sense? A little
bit? Okay. So let's say that, um,

1721
01:35:11,300 --> 01:35:15,650
I don't know. Let's say that the UFC
has issues in New York with a union.

1722
01:35:16,210 --> 01:35:19,100
You probably never heard of
anything like this, but let's say,

1723
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:24,110
let's say that the UFC has a,
has problems with a union, right?

1724
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:28,070
I mean, don't you have to go
to New Jersey to see a UFC?

1725
01:35:28,100 --> 01:35:31,670
Like you can't go to New York
and, and, and why? So why,

1726
01:35:31,700 --> 01:35:34,760
why is this union now so
negative towards the UFC?

1727
01:35:35,010 --> 01:35:38,100
Well, I'll give you the full
details. It's the culinary union.

1728
01:35:38,101 --> 01:35:41,640
The reason why the culinary union is
against the UFC and the UFC is owned by

1729
01:35:41,641 --> 01:35:45,150
[inaudible] Zoo for the
parent company of the UFC,

1730
01:35:45,180 --> 01:35:48,150
also own station casino station casinos.

1731
01:35:48,151 --> 01:35:52,410
There's 20 plus station
casinos and they are non union.

1732
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:54,660
So the Culinary Union
does not control them.

1733
01:35:54,661 --> 01:35:57,630
They don't reap benefits and
rewards and money from them.

1734
01:35:59,160 --> 01:36:02,850
It would be worth upwards of,
according to many sources,

1735
01:36:02,851 --> 01:36:06,600
more than $15 million a year.
So they spend an exorbitant amount,

1736
01:36:06,810 --> 01:36:11,310
exorbitant amounts of money
to make the UFC look terrible,

1737
01:36:11,311 --> 01:36:15,600
to highlight anything that any fighter
says that's politically incorrect and

1738
01:36:15,870 --> 01:36:19,560
harp on it and pay off politicians
to keep it out in New York state.

1739
01:36:19,561 --> 01:36:21,420
That's the last place where it's illegal.

1740
01:36:21,660 --> 01:36:26,490
But it's also just New York is a
deeply rooted, corrupt institution.

1741
01:36:26,820 --> 01:36:28,710
I mean it's, it's showing it, I mean,

1742
01:36:28,711 --> 01:36:30,690
some of the people that
have commented on the UFC,

1743
01:36:30,691 --> 01:36:34,290
they have done so with complete
disregard to the truth,

1744
01:36:34,620 --> 01:36:38,070
to the facts of the competition
itself, to the, the,

1745
01:36:38,100 --> 01:36:42,750
the laws and the regulations and the
safety record of the UFC. I mean,

1746
01:36:42,751 --> 01:36:47,700
they're distorted perceptions are
distorted depictions rather of the mixed

1747
01:36:47,701 --> 01:36:48,301
martial arts.

1748
01:36:48,301 --> 01:36:52,740
I've been just grossly inaccurate and
willfully and they've done so because they

1749
01:36:52,741 --> 01:36:53,820
were being paid to do that.

1750
01:36:54,020 --> 01:36:55,070
Right?
Yeah.

1751
01:36:55,071 --> 01:36:58,190
So something that UFC is doing is to
their perception negative to their

1752
01:36:58,250 --> 01:37:02,360
interests and therefore they become
very hostile towards the, uh, the UFC.

1753
01:37:02,870 --> 01:37:06,440
Now this doesn't mean that everyone
who's upset with me is in this category.

1754
01:37:06,441 --> 01:37:10,400
I'm sure there's many legitimate reasons
to, to have a negative opinion of me.

1755
01:37:10,401 --> 01:37:15,110
But, uh, I think that the people who
are the most upset of the people who,

1756
01:37:15,140 --> 01:37:18,980
um, their, their adult children
listened to my show. And I said,

1757
01:37:18,981 --> 01:37:22,970
I'm just, as everyone has been
telling women for 50 years, I said,

1758
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,150
you don't have to put up with abuse,
but you should sit down,

1759
01:37:26,151 --> 01:37:26,781
talk with your parents,

1760
01:37:26,781 --> 01:37:29,180
and you should get a therapist if
you're going to think about separating.

1761
01:37:29,770 --> 01:37:33,310
So you think it's just people that are
like the parents of these people that are

1762
01:37:33,311 --> 01:37:33,771
separating,

1763
01:37:33,771 --> 01:37:36,790
that are pissed off at you because you're
challenging the rule that they have

1764
01:37:36,791 --> 01:37:37,520
over their children.

1765
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:41,160
I know a lot of the people,
uh, who, uh, have, uh, um,

1766
01:37:42,620 --> 01:37:46,460
who have a websites. In fact, one
of them was even on my show and I'm,

1767
01:37:47,270 --> 01:37:50,660
so, it's not a huge mystery to me
as to what their identity is. Now,

1768
01:37:50,900 --> 01:37:54,530
the other thing to remember is that I
don't have a lot of shows about this.

1769
01:37:54,890 --> 01:37:59,520
I've done 3000 shows of which three or
four have been me talking about this

1770
01:37:59,521 --> 01:38:04,080
topic, right? So this is not any
kind of central focus of what it is.

1771
01:38:04,081 --> 01:38:06,510
It's just if people ask me
where the principles apply,

1772
01:38:06,780 --> 01:38:10,500
I have to say where I think the
principles apply and I have to provide my

1773
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:14,220
arguments. So I does not a big
topic for me. I understand.

1774
01:38:14,221 --> 01:38:18,450
Of course it's a big topic for
other people and so if you have, um,

1775
01:38:18,510 --> 01:38:21,480
if you are a parent and your child
has had significant issues with you,

1776
01:38:21,481 --> 01:38:25,350
that child has grown up, that child has
listened to me and they have sat down.

1777
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:27,450
Like if I have any influence over someone,

1778
01:38:27,451 --> 01:38:30,770
then what they should do that say
is do what I say, which is sit down,

1779
01:38:30,790 --> 01:38:32,940
talk with your parents,
try and work things out.

1780
01:38:33,060 --> 01:38:36,330
Remember that adult relationships are
voluntary and engage with the therapist.

1781
01:38:36,331 --> 01:38:38,970
If you're thinking of separating,
like if people listen,

1782
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,840
if people listen to me then
that's what they'll do.

1783
01:38:43,230 --> 01:38:45,930
But if people aren't listening to me,
then don't claim I have any influence.

1784
01:38:45,931 --> 01:38:46,800
Like if somebody just says,

1785
01:38:46,801 --> 01:38:49,680
well I listened to three podcasts
and I walked right out of my family,

1786
01:38:49,860 --> 01:38:52,860
then that's not me. And because they're
not doing what I recommend then. Right.

1787
01:38:52,861 --> 01:38:55,350
So if I have influence by definition,

1788
01:38:55,380 --> 01:38:58,620
then the onus shifts to the
parents and the therapist. Right.

1789
01:38:58,621 --> 01:38:59,490
Because that's what I'm saying.

1790
01:38:59,491 --> 01:39:01,260
Go talk to your parents and
engage with the therapist.

1791
01:39:01,290 --> 01:39:03,690
If you're thinking of family separation,
it's what I did.

1792
01:39:04,950 --> 01:39:07,260
And so if I have influence,

1793
01:39:07,380 --> 01:39:10,620
then it shifts to the parents because
people are quote to doing what I tell them

1794
01:39:10,621 --> 01:39:12,090
to do and go on to talk to their parents.

1795
01:39:12,300 --> 01:39:16,170
And then the owners shifts
to the therapist because I
say go and don't do this.

1796
01:39:16,171 --> 01:39:18,070
Don't even think of doing any
of this without a therapist.

1797
01:39:18,100 --> 01:39:19,950
I'd recommend that in divorce
and stuff like that too.

1798
01:39:19,951 --> 01:39:24,570
I think it's beneficial in
those situations. So the
people who have hate ons, well

1799
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:27,080
I mean they,
if

1800
01:39:27,140 --> 01:39:31,340
there's not like a hard on
with hey is it's your own term,

1801
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:35,810
they giant foreskin of horror.
But say your own term. Hate
on hate on, I guess so.

1802
01:39:35,811 --> 01:39:39,390
Yeah. I don't know Jamie. All right.

1803
01:39:39,530 --> 01:39:43,550
If you've got a raging hate on wow,
how does one rage with the heat on?

1804
01:39:43,900 --> 01:39:44,650
So I dunno,

1805
01:39:44,650 --> 01:39:48,610
but I assume it involves thigh high
leather boots and acts on the nipples and

1806
01:39:48,611 --> 01:39:51,830
stuff like that. But, um, yeah, so if,

1807
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:54,490
if your kids came to you when they
were adults and they say, listen,

1808
01:39:54,491 --> 01:39:57,850
I had all these problems and you
didn't listen and you got angry and you

1809
01:39:57,851 --> 01:40:00,220
escalate and they went to a therapist
and the therapist said, wow,

1810
01:40:00,221 --> 01:40:03,370
this is a really toxic relationship.
You should try and get out. Well,

1811
01:40:03,400 --> 01:40:05,980
is it easier? They can't even
find the therapist? Probably Ryan,

1812
01:40:05,981 --> 01:40:08,680
who's the easiest person to
target and by definition,

1813
01:40:08,681 --> 01:40:10,900
if they're just pouring
hate and vitriol on me,

1814
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:15,760
is it really that surprising as to why
their kids might not want to be in their

1815
01:40:15,761 --> 01:40:18,910
lives? Like if this is what they
do in response to a challenge,

1816
01:40:19,330 --> 01:40:23,890
it's they just create hate sites and
pour all this venom and scour around and

1817
01:40:23,891 --> 01:40:27,850
manipulate and cut things out of context
and like then maybe this is something

1818
01:40:27,860 --> 01:40:28,030
to do

1819
01:40:28,030 --> 01:40:29,750
do with why their kid
signed in their lives.

1820
01:40:29,770 --> 01:40:34,770
I think as this thing went down with
Adam Carolla and then Adam was criticized

1821
01:40:35,231 --> 01:40:37,480
by Anna and Anna was criticized by you.

1822
01:40:37,481 --> 01:40:42,310
I think part of the issue is when people
communicate in essentially an echo

1823
01:40:42,311 --> 01:40:42,731
chamber,

1824
01:40:42,731 --> 01:40:46,750
there's one person talking for long
periods of time and you could take any one

1825
01:40:46,751 --> 01:40:51,370
of those chunks and decide this is
something you want to highlight and out of

1826
01:40:51,371 --> 01:40:52,630
the context of the entire,

1827
01:40:53,860 --> 01:40:57,730
you might be able to manipulate it and
make it look in a way that it's entirely

1828
01:40:57,731 --> 01:41:02,590
negative. Your position. However, what
you're saying now on this podcast,

1829
01:41:02,591 --> 01:41:04,120
obviously I haven't
listened to all your shows.

1830
01:41:04,360 --> 01:41:08,260
I've seen many of your things online, but
I haven't listened to. I quite honestly,

1831
01:41:08,261 --> 01:41:13,261
I don't think I've ever listened to any
of your positions on d fooling with your

1832
01:41:14,021 --> 01:41:14,854
family.
I think

1833
01:41:14,910 --> 01:41:16,560
anything I was talking about it that much.

1834
01:41:16,590 --> 01:41:18,900
Everything I've gotten from
is just communicating with
you and then reading the

1835
01:41:18,901 --> 01:41:21,690
criticisms of it.
But your position on this podcast,

1836
01:41:21,691 --> 01:41:26,490
I think it's very difficult to argue. I
think it's very reasonable. It's very,

1837
01:41:26,491 --> 01:41:28,620
and if I've done wrong,
if people can tell me,

1838
01:41:28,650 --> 01:41:31,020
but then the problem is it has
to go to everyone. Then I just,

1839
01:41:31,021 --> 01:41:34,860
I can't slice and dice ethics. I'm
so sorry Jeff. I was just, uh, I,

1840
01:41:34,920 --> 01:41:37,650
I've never really had a chance to talk
about this kind of stuff and I don't

1841
01:41:37,651 --> 01:41:40,170
really address it,
but I'm excited to be able to,

1842
01:41:40,260 --> 01:41:44,040
I'm glad we're talking about it because
I think it's important sometimes to give

1843
01:41:44,041 --> 01:41:47,310
people an opportunity. Like
I've had people email me, like,

1844
01:41:47,311 --> 01:41:49,860
why are you friends with Stefan Molyneux?
That guy's a dick. And I'm like,

1845
01:41:50,150 --> 01:41:54,120
like Peter Joseph fucking very
upset at you. Peter Joseph the

1846
01:41:55,770 --> 01:41:56,603
PJ.
Yeah.

1847
01:41:56,920 --> 01:41:59,650
I liked that guy.
I think he's got some great ideas,

1848
01:41:59,651 --> 01:42:04,240
but he was very upset with
you as well. Um, but whatever,
that's not important. Um,

1849
01:42:04,270 --> 01:42:08,260
I think that it's important to
have these kinds of conversations.

1850
01:42:08,261 --> 01:42:11,500
I think I need to have them too, with
people to where I go over my own ideas.

1851
01:42:11,800 --> 01:42:13,720
You know,
when you have someone disagree with you,

1852
01:42:13,721 --> 01:42:16,990
when you get a chance to look at your
position from a different angle as well,

1853
01:42:17,410 --> 01:42:20,080
and look at the perceptions
of your positions, you know,

1854
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:22,510
one of your positions to get criticized,

1855
01:42:22,511 --> 01:42:25,750
or one of the other things that gets
tossed at you as the term misogynist.

1856
01:42:26,200 --> 01:42:29,410
And I'm sure that's, uh, that's
upsetting to you as well, right?

1857
01:42:29,440 --> 01:42:30,670
You're not a massage done.
Sorry.

1858
01:42:31,530 --> 01:42:34,380
I don't even like if people
could define to me what that,

1859
01:42:34,410 --> 01:42:36,180
if it means general hatred of all women,

1860
01:42:36,181 --> 01:42:38,880
that I made a really bad choice of
who to get married too. Isn't it

1861
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:42,310
though? That's what it besides
just means. It's like if,

1862
01:42:42,410 --> 01:42:45,520
if you criticize anyone who's gay,
you're a homophobe.

1863
01:42:45,700 --> 01:42:49,630
If you have issue with someone who's
black who does something stupid like Al

1864
01:42:49,630 --> 01:42:51,340
Sharpton, you're a racist, you know, it's,

1865
01:42:51,341 --> 01:42:56,341
it's a cute way of dismembering your
argument or dismembering your position

1866
01:42:56,860 --> 01:42:57,693
right away.

1867
01:42:57,940 --> 01:43:02,940
But you said some stuff about women that
I have even disagreed with and one of

1868
01:43:04,601 --> 01:43:06,490
them,
you did this thing recently.

1869
01:43:06,500 --> 01:43:11,500
We were talking about how the way
to get assholes out of society,

1870
01:43:11,630 --> 01:43:15,670
it's women's responsibility cause women
are breeding with these assholes and

1871
01:43:15,671 --> 01:43:16,150
they're making,

1872
01:43:16,150 --> 01:43:18,160
it's the only women's responsibility,
right?

1873
01:43:18,161 --> 01:43:22,000
It's a key part of the equation that
I think is not discussed enough,

1874
01:43:22,060 --> 01:43:23,620
which is the sexual choices of women.

1875
01:43:23,670 --> 01:43:27,150
That expression or that, that,
that sentence is really critical.

1876
01:43:27,151 --> 01:43:30,690
It's not only women's responsibility,
but in what I saw,

1877
01:43:30,691 --> 01:43:32,880
the thing that you went off on,
you were talking,

1878
01:43:32,881 --> 01:43:34,920
I think it was the Elliot Rogers thing,
is that what it was?

1879
01:43:34,921 --> 01:43:37,890
We were talking about that fucking crazy
kid up in Santa Barbara that killed

1880
01:43:37,891 --> 01:43:41,580
everybody by the way.
He killed more men than he did women.

1881
01:43:41,730 --> 01:43:44,250
It's one of the things that I found
fascinating that that soul, yes.

1882
01:43:44,251 --> 01:43:45,810
All Women Hashtag yes,

1883
01:43:45,811 --> 01:43:50,100
all women thing came out after four men
were murdered in and two women and that

1884
01:43:50,101 --> 01:43:54,800
guy was a piece of, regardless of
gender and gender had very little to do.

1885
01:43:54,801 --> 01:43:59,180
He was mad at the men that women
found attractive. This is not a,

1886
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:02,090
it's not an even game,
this life, you know,

1887
01:44:02,091 --> 01:44:05,540
there's people that were born and they
look like Beyonce and then there's people

1888
01:44:05,541 --> 01:44:08,270
that are born that looked like Bridget,
the midget and you know,

1889
01:44:08,530 --> 01:44:10,790
I didn't even know who that is.
Is the onsite or bridge of the images.

1890
01:44:10,850 --> 01:44:14,690
The second one, I dare you pretend you
don't know who that is. She's a porn star.

1891
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:19,790
Oh yeah. She's a small person. Porn
Star. All right, my, but point being,

1892
01:44:20,390 --> 01:44:22,400
you know, it's, we didn't,

1893
01:44:22,460 --> 01:44:27,140
it's not like you've earned being beyond
size looks, you know, no one earned that.

1894
01:44:27,170 --> 01:44:30,410
No one worked really hard. She might've
worked really hard to get that body,

1895
01:44:30,411 --> 01:44:34,490
but she's a beautiful person. She was
born extremely physically attractive.

1896
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:38,330
And if you're voice yes, I mean,
you know, good practice forever.

1897
01:44:38,331 --> 01:44:41,850
Onca sounded like that in this
Elliot Rodger Guy was, uh, you know,

1898
01:44:41,930 --> 01:44:45,830
he was socially awkward and probably
mentally there was something wrong with

1899
01:44:45,831 --> 01:44:49,190
them. Asberger's whatever the fuck it was.
I don't know what was wrong with them,

1900
01:44:49,191 --> 01:44:51,410
but if you watch his
videos where he's talking,

1901
01:44:51,650 --> 01:44:54,320
there's clearly some sort of
a weird social disconnect.

1902
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:58,250
He had a really hard time connecting
with people and, and couldn't,

1903
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:01,610
couldn't get a woman to like
him for various reasons,

1904
01:45:01,820 --> 01:45:04,400
blamed them for his hate and is feeling.

1905
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:07,670
That's when people see,
when they look around,

1906
01:45:07,671 --> 01:45:09,380
they see all these people
that are attractive.

1907
01:45:09,530 --> 01:45:10,730
They see all these people that are,

1908
01:45:10,760 --> 01:45:14,180
that are attracted to each other
and then they're left out of that.

1909
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:18,020
They are frustrated, they're
angry. It drives him fucking crazy.

1910
01:45:18,050 --> 01:45:23,050
And I think that's where this
Elliot Rogers guy fit in.

1911
01:45:23,121 --> 01:45:27,890
And when this, yes, all women
thing came about on one hand,

1912
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:31,550
I agree with it. I, it's got to be
way more difficult to be a woman.

1913
01:45:31,551 --> 01:45:35,180
Way more difficult to constantly
worry about your own physical safety,

1914
01:45:35,330 --> 01:45:37,610
worry about men wanting
to sexually assault you,

1915
01:45:37,611 --> 01:45:42,050
which is very rare for a man to
fear. I mean, maybe in prison, yeah.

1916
01:45:42,051 --> 01:45:46,700
But in real life it's very rare for men
to worry about other men physically,

1917
01:45:46,701 --> 01:45:50,660
sexually abusing them or
wanting to get them somewhere,

1918
01:45:50,661 --> 01:45:53,300
roofie them up and sexually abused them.
But for women,

1919
01:45:53,301 --> 01:45:55,430
it's a super common occurrence.
It's a,

1920
01:45:55,431 --> 01:45:59,570
women in bars are always worried about
covering their drink. I've talked to,

1921
01:46:00,470 --> 01:46:05,470
it leaves five women over the course of
my life that believe or ward definitely

1922
01:46:05,601 --> 01:46:10,190
roof feed or we're definitely
drugged by someone with unknown drug.

1923
01:46:10,191 --> 01:46:11,720
They woke up in someone's hotel room.

1924
01:46:11,721 --> 01:46:16,721
It's disgusting and evil and creepy and
it's something that men don't have to

1925
01:46:16,761 --> 01:46:18,680
worry about, but women do. Um,

1926
01:46:19,160 --> 01:46:23,030
but when a guy like that comes along,
I think the,

1927
01:46:23,060 --> 01:46:27,590
it's not a matter of,
it's not a matter of,

1928
01:46:28,430 --> 01:46:31,190
it's a matter of a mental illness
is what it is. I mean that guy,

1929
01:46:31,240 --> 01:46:32,660
it was a mentally ill person.

1930
01:46:33,050 --> 01:46:35,900
I don't know what causes a person
like that to be mentally ill.

1931
01:46:35,901 --> 01:46:40,010
But I don't think that women can
prevent that by not breeding.

1932
01:46:40,460 --> 01:46:45,230
I don't think that women can prevent a
guy like that from being born. I mean,

1933
01:46:45,231 --> 01:46:46,970
I don't think his parents were abusive.

1934
01:46:46,971 --> 01:46:49,950
I've never read anything that said
that his parents anything evil to him.

1935
01:46:49,951 --> 01:46:54,510
So how does an evil guy like that come
about is mentally, he's mentally ill.

1936
01:46:54,570 --> 01:46:57,480
Something happened during his childhood
and I don't think anybody could have

1937
01:46:57,481 --> 01:46:58,740
prevented that by being a woman,

1938
01:46:58,741 --> 01:47:01,870
not allowing him to have sex
with them or whatever. You know,

1939
01:47:01,871 --> 01:47:06,030
what you were talking about. I think
especially in this particular example,

1940
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:08,940
that guy was sick.
There's something wrong with him.

1941
01:47:08,970 --> 01:47:10,140
There's sick people all the time.

1942
01:47:10,290 --> 01:47:13,470
You can go down the street and there's
a guy who pushes his car to car talks to

1943
01:47:13,471 --> 01:47:15,360
himself. And I don't think
it's, cause no one fucked him.

1944
01:47:15,510 --> 01:47:18,510
I think that guy's got something wrong.
There's an issue there.

1945
01:47:18,810 --> 01:47:21,870
And I think that was what this Elliot
Rodger Guy, there's an issue with him.

1946
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:25,620
That guy was a monster. That guy was
an asshole and it's no woman's fault.

1947
01:47:27,110 --> 01:47:29,600
Well,
okay.

1948
01:47:29,601 --> 01:47:34,580
So let's pull back from Elliot Rodger
because we don't know much about his

1949
01:47:34,581 --> 01:47:35,031
childhood.

1950
01:47:35,031 --> 01:47:38,210
We know that he had some complaints
about the way his step mom treated him.

1951
01:47:38,211 --> 01:47:40,040
But I went over that in the video.
So,

1952
01:47:41,240 --> 01:47:43,790
so a study came out recently and again,

1953
01:47:43,791 --> 01:47:48,791
I had the guy on my show to talk about
it and what he did was he went to a solid

1954
01:47:49,060 --> 01:47:51,920
middle class neighborhood and went
to a daycare and he said to the women

1955
01:47:51,921 --> 01:47:55,490
listening, I really want to study
aggression, yelling, whatever in families,

1956
01:47:55,640 --> 01:47:57,820
I need you to wear this recorder before,
I don't know,

1957
01:47:57,821 --> 01:48:01,160
a week or 10 days or
whatever it was. And, uh,

1958
01:48:01,161 --> 01:48:06,161
so he had the women wear this recorder
and then he got the footage back or the

1959
01:48:07,070 --> 01:48:12,070
audio back and he found that the
women were hitting the children a lot.

1960
01:48:17,060 --> 01:48:20,150
A lot like 936 times a year.

1961
01:48:20,780 --> 01:48:25,780
An average of three times a day from 16
months to four years of age where it was

1962
01:48:26,691 --> 01:48:29,840
this study. Where is it taking
place? Some, I can't remember where,

1963
01:48:29,841 --> 01:48:33,470
but it was sitting. Yeah. I'll give you
the link for, maybe Micah can dig it up.

1964
01:48:33,471 --> 01:48:36,680
I'll give you the link for the show.
936

1965
01:48:36,790 --> 01:48:39,610
how many people were involved
in the study? I think 40 or so.

1966
01:48:39,700 --> 01:48:40,810
So it's not comprehensive,

1967
01:48:40,811 --> 01:48:43,330
but this is a middle class neighborhood
conferences and even poor, right.

1968
01:48:43,331 --> 01:48:46,210
40 is a pretty good number.
And out of those 40 people,

1969
01:48:46,211 --> 01:48:47,980
what percentage of them
were hitting their kids?

1970
01:48:48,370 --> 01:48:52,720
I think all but two and the other
two were verbally aggressive. Whoa.

1971
01:48:53,230 --> 01:48:58,230
So the idea that women are not part of
the cycle of violence to me seems a,

1972
01:48:58,960 --> 01:49:02,590
and again, this doesn't explain Elliot
Rodger of competent, you know, but, but,

1973
01:49:02,630 --> 01:49:06,370
but the reality is that uh,
women and men to like, again,

1974
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:11,740
not all women, right? My wife
has an incredible mom. Uh,

1975
01:49:11,741 --> 01:49:16,390
but um, there is a lot of aggression
coming from women to towards children.

1976
01:49:16,570 --> 01:49:18,760
Now it's funny because
when people talk about,

1977
01:49:18,761 --> 01:49:21,160
when I talk about this kind of stuff,
people will say, well, what about men?

1978
01:49:21,190 --> 01:49:24,730
It's like, but we know about men. We need
to look at the stuff that's not seen.

1979
01:49:25,060 --> 01:49:26,920
Right. Because right
now it's like, you know,

1980
01:49:26,921 --> 01:49:31,840
like it's just man at ist and men need
to change. Yes, men need to change.

1981
01:49:31,870 --> 01:49:33,790
Absolutely.
Of course men need to change,

1982
01:49:34,090 --> 01:49:38,800
but saying that women are not part of
the cycle of violence is not correct with

1983
01:49:38,801 --> 01:49:43,690
the data.
And I am committed against all calumny,

1984
01:49:43,691 --> 01:49:46,720
against all insults,
against all hates and trolls.

1985
01:49:46,721 --> 01:49:50,020
I am to doing everything I can
to maximize peace in the world.

1986
01:49:50,050 --> 01:49:52,690
I know that sounds like crappy
and diluted and all that,

1987
01:49:52,691 --> 01:49:55,780
but that is my commitment,
you know, in life.

1988
01:49:56,170 --> 01:49:59,770
And if we can get women
to stop hitting children,

1989
01:50:01,120 --> 01:50:04,930
the world will become a much more
peaceful place if we can get men to stop

1990
01:50:04,931 --> 01:50:06,910
hitting children. Absolutely. But we,

1991
01:50:07,010 --> 01:50:12,010
the male aggression has
already been focused on so
much that there is this blind

1992
01:50:12,011 --> 01:50:12,700
spot,

1993
01:50:12,700 --> 01:50:15,880
which is the degree to which women use
aggression in the raising of children.

1994
01:50:16,120 --> 01:50:20,290
80% of British mothers spank their
child before the child is one year old.

1995
01:50:21,100 --> 01:50:22,360
Wow.
I mean it's,

1996
01:50:22,361 --> 01:50:27,361
it's mad centers and those of us who
have great wives and peaceful girlfriends

1997
01:50:27,581 --> 01:50:31,070
and all that, there is a whole
world out there of people who,

1998
01:50:31,390 --> 01:50:34,120
and men and women. But again,
we've talked about the mental,

1999
01:50:34,121 --> 01:50:34,990
I'd focus on the women.

2000
01:50:36,080 --> 01:50:39,370
Damn it. Well that just dad is very
different than what we're talking about.

2001
01:50:39,880 --> 01:50:44,050
You know, we're talking about
is a, is horrific. You know,

2002
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:47,380
we're talking about is just,
that's any,

2003
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:50,920
anytime you're getting a
fucking baby that's sick.

2004
01:50:51,010 --> 01:50:54,700
And the fact that so many people
do it is really hard to believe.

2005
01:50:54,701 --> 01:50:58,900
I don't have any access to any statistics
and I believe you. I'm not, I'm not,

2006
01:50:59,080 --> 01:51:00,670
well again, people can look, I had the,

2007
01:51:00,671 --> 01:51:04,920
I grilled the guy on my show and a
so people can can listen to it. Um,

2008
01:51:05,470 --> 01:51:08,890
but uh, Mike is going to put it out
on Twitter. My Twitter handle this,

2009
01:51:08,950 --> 01:51:11,530
Stefan Molyneux. Uh, but
um, yeah, people can,

2010
01:51:11,531 --> 01:51:14,310
can look at the study and this is all
lots of studies around this study.

2011
01:51:14,450 --> 01:51:18,350
I'll retweet that study cause
that's, that's incredibly
disturbing. And when kids,

2012
01:51:18,420 --> 01:51:22,580
the issue of course is that when
kids are hit by their loved ones,

2013
01:51:22,720 --> 01:51:25,750
they are way more likely to hit their
loved ones. They're wearing my Leica,

2014
01:51:25,760 --> 01:51:30,140
you accept violence.
Some of the scariest kids are ever,

2015
01:51:30,141 --> 01:51:31,790
or kids that were abused at home.

2016
01:51:31,870 --> 01:51:36,590
And I remember growing up with this kid
that was a abused at home and he was so

2017
01:51:36,591 --> 01:51:41,300
quick to violence and it's, it's super
cool. We find it in the UFC as well.

2018
01:51:41,301 --> 01:51:44,480
Some of the best fighters were
bullied when they were younger.

2019
01:51:44,481 --> 01:51:46,010
They were beaten up by their brothers.

2020
01:51:46,040 --> 01:51:49,310
Some of the scariest guys or guys who
had older brothers used to kick their

2021
01:51:49,311 --> 01:51:53,060
asses because they get used to having
that from their family and their loved

2022
01:51:53,061 --> 01:51:56,570
ones. And they have a certain tolerance
to violence and a certain tolerance to

2023
01:51:56,571 --> 01:52:00,740
aggression that other folks don't have.
They have a peace with it, you know,

2024
01:52:00,741 --> 01:52:02,810
so they're not as afraid of fighting.

2025
01:52:02,811 --> 01:52:07,220
They're not as afraid of competition
as the other folks are. And um, yeah,

2026
01:52:07,221 --> 01:52:09,650
that's a,
that's a terrible cycle to be a part of.

2027
01:52:09,651 --> 01:52:12,320
And those numbers are absolutely
incredibly disturbing.

2028
01:52:12,770 --> 01:52:15,920
But that's not exactly what I had
read what I had read where you were,

2029
01:52:15,921 --> 01:52:20,660
you were essentially talking about women's
attraction to assholes and that this

2030
01:52:20,661 --> 01:52:25,250
was the cause of their being
more assholes. And if women
just stood up and said,

2031
01:52:25,251 --> 01:52:27,440
they're not going to be
with assholes anymore,

2032
01:52:27,560 --> 01:52:29,360
we wouldn't have any assholes
in the world. And I just,

2033
01:52:29,670 --> 01:52:32,220
well, look, I mean, when, when,

2034
01:52:32,221 --> 01:52:36,150
when it stated as a completing an isolated
absolute, I get that. It sounds do.

2035
01:52:36,200 --> 01:52:37,790
Right, right, right. And I, you know,

2036
01:52:37,791 --> 01:52:41,220
I certainly held men's feet to the fire
as far as aggression and violence goes

2037
01:52:41,221 --> 01:52:45,090
as well. And I've talked to dads
not to hit their kids and all that.

2038
01:52:45,230 --> 01:52:47,570
I'm not saying, well, no, I don't
need to talk to you. You're the dead.

2039
01:52:47,571 --> 01:52:50,030
Let me talk to the only person who
was ever aggressive to children,

2040
01:52:50,031 --> 01:52:53,030
which must be the woman.
But the reality is, I think,

2041
01:52:53,210 --> 01:52:56,160
and I think this is somewhat debatable,

2042
01:52:56,190 --> 01:53:00,710
I think it's fairly well established that
in general men ask women out and women

2043
01:53:00,711 --> 01:53:02,930
say yes or no.
That's generally how it works.

2044
01:53:02,931 --> 01:53:05,390
And there are exceptions and
all that, right? But in studies,

2045
01:53:05,391 --> 01:53:08,090
I've read about 90% of
dates or initiated by men.

2046
01:53:09,470 --> 01:53:14,240
And so women are doing the choosing.
And I'm saying to women,

2047
01:53:14,810 --> 01:53:18,530
one of the ways that women can incredibly
contribute to reducing the cycle of

2048
01:53:18,531 --> 01:53:23,510
violence is to choose better man. Because
there's a part of women, and again,

2049
01:53:23,511 --> 01:53:26,300
this is fairly well established as
least as well as these things can be

2050
01:53:26,301 --> 01:53:30,300
established. There's a part of women that
likes the Alpha Guy, right? That the,

2051
01:53:30,301 --> 01:53:32,550
the guy who's kind of cold and,

2052
01:53:32,551 --> 01:53:35,870
and efficient and I mean I'm plowing
my way through 50 shades of grey.

2053
01:53:35,871 --> 01:53:40,560
God helped me how to you if you know
it, I'm telling you. Oh, you, oh,

2054
01:53:40,580 --> 01:53:45,350
I'm sorry he's not a midget porn star,
but yes, this is all I got. Right? But,

2055
01:53:45,351 --> 01:53:46,700
um,
and I get that,

2056
01:53:46,730 --> 01:53:51,730
I mean men are attracted to particular
physical things which indicate fertility

2057
01:53:51,860 --> 01:53:55,970
and women are attracted to particular
male traits that indicate good provider.

2058
01:53:56,210 --> 01:53:59,060
And again, there's nothing wrong with
any of that. That's perfectly natural.

2059
01:53:59,870 --> 01:54:04,870
But the reality is that we do need to be
wise in who we choose to raise our kids

2060
01:54:05,211 --> 01:54:06,710
with and who we choose to have kids with.

2061
01:54:07,160 --> 01:54:11,150
And I berate men all the time
for choosing looks over virtue.

2062
01:54:12,170 --> 01:54:13,130
I mean,
on my show,

2063
01:54:13,131 --> 01:54:16,610
I'm horrendous on men for choosing looks
over virtue and we've all been there,

2064
01:54:16,611 --> 01:54:19,040
we've all done it. And we all know
what a mistake then is, right?

2065
01:54:19,730 --> 01:54:21,980
What is it that someone says,
I don't care how good looking she is.

2066
01:54:21,981 --> 01:54:23,990
There's some guy out there who's
tired of screwing her. Right?

2067
01:54:24,470 --> 01:54:28,340
And so I talked to Matt about
don't just go for virtue. You know,

2068
01:54:28,850 --> 01:54:31,040
virtue is the big tits of philosophy,
right?

2069
01:54:31,041 --> 01:54:34,550
I mean that's what you want to to go
for when you're going to get married.

2070
01:54:34,790 --> 01:54:37,220
And for women, I say the
same thing, go for virtue,

2071
01:54:37,340 --> 01:54:42,340
but I think men's tendency to choose on
shallow standards is fairly well known.

2072
01:54:42,890 --> 01:54:45,650
And again, I'm just trying
to sort of shine the light
on that other side and say,

2073
01:54:45,651 --> 01:54:46,484
look,

2074
01:54:46,610 --> 01:54:49,820
if like you need to sort of cross your
legs and grit your teeth and say he may

2075
01:54:49,821 --> 01:54:52,280
be sexy but he's not a good guy,
I'm not going to have kids with him.

2076
01:54:52,640 --> 01:54:56,680
And I think that will help a lot. I
mean, I want to empower women to be like,

2077
01:54:56,780 --> 01:55:01,010
not to be victims alone, right? I mean I'm
trying to empower, once you give people,

2078
01:55:01,160 --> 01:55:01,971
like if you say,
look,

2079
01:55:01,971 --> 01:55:04,880
women are part of the cycle of violence
than women aren't helpless and just need

2080
01:55:04,881 --> 01:55:06,800
to sit on their knees and
beg men not to be violent.

2081
01:55:06,980 --> 01:55:11,330
Women can actually talk amongst
themselves and be empowered to do things,

2082
01:55:11,331 --> 01:55:14,510
to help reduce the prevalence of
violence in society. Choose better men.

2083
01:55:14,511 --> 01:55:17,390
Don't punish your kids, don't
yell at them, don't hit it
them reasoned with them.

2084
01:55:17,690 --> 01:55:20,690
That gives women something to do rather
than cross their fingers and hope that

2085
01:55:20,691 --> 01:55:21,524
men get better.

2086
01:55:22,840 --> 01:55:23,740
You.
Um,

2087
01:55:24,130 --> 01:55:28,540
you also did this thing on Robin
Williams and you do a lot of these,

2088
01:55:28,541 --> 01:55:33,541
the truth about people and you do these
a one hour long pieces where you stare

2089
01:55:34,481 --> 01:55:37,270
at the camera and explain and
I don't even various, yeah,

2090
01:55:37,470 --> 01:55:42,270
don't even blink. My eyes
are so dry. It you, uh,

2091
01:55:42,300 --> 01:55:46,900
just before, I'm so sorry to interrupt.
Um, uh, and we'll get right back to the,

2092
01:55:46,990 --> 01:55:50,280
go ahead to Robin, but a, so this
is from the doctor Phil website.

2093
01:55:50,281 --> 01:55:53,700
I had this bookmarked and that
up. Dr Phil. No, but look,

2094
01:55:53,701 --> 01:55:56,850
Dr Phil has on his advisory board,
all of the top stars,

2095
01:55:56,880 --> 01:55:59,850
Dr. Phillips in the Bardo who was
past head of the APA and all that.

2096
01:55:59,851 --> 01:56:03,900
So he's got the top guys. And this is
what he says. If you were abused, right.

2097
01:56:04,590 --> 01:56:09,270
And I'll just read the last bit,
right. And we can tweet this as well.

2098
01:56:10,380 --> 01:56:12,240
Um,
do what is best for you.

2099
01:56:12,241 --> 01:56:14,910
Consider the possibility that it may
not be healthy to have any sort of

2100
01:56:14,911 --> 01:56:15,990
relationship with your parents.

2101
01:56:16,020 --> 01:56:18,870
It's a difficult pill to swallow and
it should be used as the last option.

2102
01:56:18,871 --> 01:56:20,910
However, it may be the option
that helps you. The most.

2103
01:56:21,920 --> 01:56:26,900
Doctor Phil also said that if a
man is masturbating to a video,

2104
01:56:27,080 --> 01:56:30,440
that's just as much of a betrayal as
if he had another woman in that room.

2105
01:56:30,470 --> 01:56:34,080
Actually that's Jesus. Uh, channel
and talk to Phyllis. No, but I mean,

2106
01:56:34,081 --> 01:56:38,950
so that's not his psychological science.
Right. But I just know about videos, um,

2107
01:56:39,170 --> 01:56:41,840
so ahead of his time anyway,
so I just wanted this,

2108
01:56:41,841 --> 01:56:44,690
this question is sort of voluntary
family stuff. Uh, you know,

2109
01:56:44,691 --> 01:56:48,730
people can get mad at Dr Fail, but I'm
basically just echoing what I'm, what

2110
01:56:48,890 --> 01:56:51,590
I think people should get married. A
Doctor Phil just for his fucking mustache.

2111
01:56:51,591 --> 01:56:55,310
How about that? All right. Sorry.
Back to, no worries. Um, yeah.

2112
01:56:55,311 --> 01:56:57,080
About back to Robin Williams.

2113
01:56:57,660 --> 01:57:02,570
E what are these videos that you do?
I think they're very interesting.

2114
01:57:02,571 --> 01:57:07,571
But to do a biography on someone requires
an extensive amount of preparation and

2115
01:57:09,531 --> 01:57:10,940
massive amounts of research.

2116
01:57:10,970 --> 01:57:15,290
So when you do the truth and the word
the truth is a very tricky thing because

2117
01:57:15,291 --> 01:57:19,250
there's many truths as many versions.
Like I've had conversations with people,

2118
01:57:19,251 --> 01:57:20,510
they'll say, oh, you know,

2119
01:57:20,511 --> 01:57:23,870
I heard that this person met this
person and that person was an asshole.

2120
01:57:24,140 --> 01:57:27,660
And I'm like, well, actually I was there
and that's not what happened at all.

2121
01:57:27,950 --> 01:57:30,920
That person was annoying as fuck and
the other person was trying to get away

2122
01:57:30,921 --> 01:57:34,760
from them. And that's why, you know,
they looked like an asshole. Um,

2123
01:57:35,510 --> 01:57:36,920
you did this,

2124
01:57:36,921 --> 01:57:41,420
the true thing about Robin Williams and
your conclusion was that Robin Williams

2125
01:57:41,421 --> 01:57:46,421
died because of women's addiction
to free stuff and that he,

2126
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:51,880
he essentially killed himself because of
the fact that he owed money because the

2127
01:57:51,921 --> 01:57:56,840
fact that he spent a lot of money in
his, a alimony. Um, I think that's a,

2128
01:57:58,160 --> 01:58:02,690
I think that's an irresponsible statement
because, uh, I think first of all,

2129
01:58:02,750 --> 01:58:06,890
it may have been a factor. It's certainly
was a factor in his unhappiness,

2130
01:58:07,280 --> 01:58:12,280
but we're not even aware of what kind of
behavior he had in those relationships.

2131
01:58:12,561 --> 01:58:15,620
It was probably also a factor in
the breakup of the relationship.

2132
01:58:15,621 --> 01:58:20,621
Also a factor in the antagonism that he
shared with his ex wives if and when,

2133
01:58:20,750 --> 01:58:25,190
whether or not that did take place,
but also his alcoholism,

2134
01:58:25,191 --> 01:58:29,720
his drug dependency has medical
state, the state of the, just the,

2135
01:58:29,721 --> 01:58:34,010
the natural body and brain chemistry
after years and years of abusing drugs and

2136
01:58:34,011 --> 01:58:37,430
then going back into it
and then depression itself.

2137
01:58:37,460 --> 01:58:42,220
Then on top of that Parkinson's disease.
Then on top of that, whatever medication,

2138
01:58:42,221 --> 01:58:44,740
then he was taken for
Parkinson's disease disease,

2139
01:58:44,741 --> 01:58:47,920
which many have been proven
to cause depression in people.

2140
01:58:47,921 --> 01:58:52,921
So to boil it all down to Robin Williams
died because of women's addiction to

2141
01:58:53,831 --> 01:58:56,710
free stuff.
I think that's irresponsible.

2142
01:58:58,200 --> 01:58:59,280
Well,
I'm in and again,

2143
01:58:59,281 --> 01:59:02,000
I said at the beginning of the video
that this is not all set in stone.

2144
01:59:02,001 --> 01:59:05,460
It's just my, my thoughts,
but I think that's a good
case to be made. I really do.

2145
01:59:05,520 --> 01:59:05,761
I mean,

2146
01:59:05,761 --> 01:59:10,140
because the timing to me is like right
after his show was canceled and he's

2147
01:59:10,141 --> 01:59:14,850
paying $600,000 a year to
his first wife from the 80s.

2148
01:59:15,510 --> 01:59:18,240
I mean that, that's what the settler,
he hadn't, he had a prenup with her,

2149
01:59:18,241 --> 01:59:22,380
but it got thrown out. Right. And
um, has prenup get thrown out?

2150
01:59:22,410 --> 01:59:25,200
How's that work out if the judge
thinks it's not reasonable?

2151
01:59:26,250 --> 01:59:29,060
I mean people sort of, cause people
post it back to me and said, well,

2152
01:59:29,070 --> 01:59:32,970
you should've gotten a prenup.
Prenup is not bullet proof. I mean,

2153
01:59:33,060 --> 01:59:35,850
how many things happened that on
Congress is supposed to declare war?

2154
01:59:35,851 --> 01:59:38,850
How many was this Congress to care
like three out of the hundred wars that

2155
01:59:38,851 --> 01:59:43,530
America has been involved with. It's just
part of the law. So a prenup. Um, um,

2156
01:59:43,860 --> 01:59:47,100
Steven Spielberg's wife, I
think Amy Irving, they've
been married for four years.

2157
01:59:47,101 --> 01:59:51,930
They had a prenup and uh, she ended
up taking 100 million from him.

2158
01:59:52,280 --> 01:59:56,750
Yeah. A cell prenup is not a
reasonable, yeah. A prenup is not a,

2159
01:59:56,760 --> 01:59:57,510
it's not a magic.
Yeah.

2160
01:59:57,510 --> 02:00:01,560
Bullet. Weird. She hasn't worked since
one of why lost all over ambition.

2161
02:00:02,420 --> 02:00:06,120
Denny's probably isn't hiring.
So you know, how dare you,

2162
02:00:06,121 --> 02:00:07,920
she was an accomplished actress,
right?

2163
02:00:08,690 --> 02:00:12,710
And he's a lucky guy.
Shelter 20 to 30 million bucks in alimony,

2164
02:00:13,570 --> 02:00:17,020
so made 200 and something million
over the course of his career.

2165
02:00:17,110 --> 02:00:21,270
He made an insane amount of money, the
to the, the fact that he's broke. Um,

2166
02:00:21,460 --> 02:00:24,820
even if he did have to
pay out $30 million,

2167
02:00:24,880 --> 02:00:29,350
it can't be totally attributed to the
fact that his ex wives took an incredible

2168
02:00:29,351 --> 02:00:33,550
amount of money. It has to be attributed
also to poor management of his finances.

2169
02:00:33,760 --> 02:00:37,870
It has to be attributed to just the
overall recklessness that he exhibited in

2170
02:00:37,871 --> 02:00:41,860
his life. He was a very impulsive
guy. As many great comics are, it's a,

2171
02:00:41,861 --> 02:00:46,180
it's an attribute that many great comics
share is this wild, impulsive behavior.

2172
02:00:46,330 --> 02:00:47,800
I've struggled with it myself.

2173
02:00:47,830 --> 02:00:50,830
Most of my friends have struggled
with it or aren't struggling.

2174
02:00:50,831 --> 02:00:52,790
They're just fucking embrace it.
Um,

2175
02:00:52,810 --> 02:00:55,330
it's a part of what makes someone
a comic in the first place,

2176
02:00:55,331 --> 02:00:58,480
and that is as much of Robin's problem,

2177
02:00:58,810 --> 02:01:03,430
his poor financial management.
Um, as the divorce settlements,

2178
02:01:03,431 --> 02:01:04,480
cause if he had just,

2179
02:01:04,590 --> 02:01:09,020
if he had been prudent with
his finances and had been, um,

2180
02:01:09,400 --> 02:01:11,470
like really good at managing his career,

2181
02:01:11,740 --> 02:01:15,940
he would still have a shit fuck ton of
money even after giving away 30 million

2182
02:01:15,941 --> 02:01:20,890
bucks. But the 30 million bucks don't
mean something that sucks. Sucks. Sucks.

2183
02:01:21,220 --> 02:01:25,240
Sucks. Now, because that was 60
years old. You think that's just,

2184
02:01:25,540 --> 02:01:27,610
I don't know what just is,

2185
02:01:27,790 --> 02:01:32,170
I don't know if it's just that someone
makes $300 million by making people laugh.

2186
02:01:32,200 --> 02:01:34,930
I mean, I think if you looked
at, in terms of commerce,

2187
02:01:34,931 --> 02:01:39,100
it clearly is because people paid
to see his movies. He was a draw.

2188
02:01:39,230 --> 02:01:42,140
Everybody wanted to go see Robin Williams.
He's a hilarious guy.

2189
02:01:42,141 --> 02:01:43,820
He's a lovable personality.

2190
02:01:44,240 --> 02:01:48,500
I think the real tragedy is not as
much that he had to pay so much money.

2191
02:01:48,680 --> 02:01:52,940
It's that here's a guy who the world
loved who died alone, hanging himself.

2192
02:01:52,940 --> 02:01:53,900
Cause he was sad.

2193
02:01:54,320 --> 02:01:59,180
I mean that's the real tragedy and the
factors that led to him taking his own

2194
02:01:59,181 --> 02:02:03,560
life by cutting his wrists and hanging
himself. I mean, that's a fucking guy.

2195
02:02:03,561 --> 02:02:08,330
Wanted to be dead. Those there's,
there's many, many, many, many, many,

2196
02:02:08,331 --> 02:02:12,250
many factors in that poor
choices, a life of regret. Uh,

2197
02:02:12,260 --> 02:02:16,520
accusations of plagiarism that haunted
his professional standup comedy career.

2198
02:02:16,880 --> 02:02:20,780
All the various things that were
wrong in the life of Robin Williams,

2199
02:02:20,781 --> 02:02:24,920
that the alcoholism, the cocaine abuse,
and then of course, is health failing.

2200
02:02:24,921 --> 02:02:27,230
There's so many different
things that were wrong there.

2201
02:02:27,530 --> 02:02:29,660
The $30 million certainly hurt,

2202
02:02:29,990 --> 02:02:34,990
but Robin Williams made an ungodly
sum of money throughout his career.

2203
02:02:35,540 --> 02:02:38,180
He was a huge fucking star.

2204
02:02:38,690 --> 02:02:41,420
He was making shitloads of money.

2205
02:02:42,140 --> 02:02:46,400
He could have been fine if he had
managed his, his, his resources better.

2206
02:02:46,401 --> 02:02:50,750
I don't think you can say that the $30
million that he gave his wives was the

2207
02:02:50,751 --> 02:02:55,640
problem. Well, it was a problem for sure,

2208
02:02:55,880 --> 02:02:59,570
and probably wasn't other than the
real estate, right. I mean, he had,

2209
02:02:59,571 --> 02:03:02,530
I think a $30 million ranch
that he was trying to offload,

2210
02:03:02,531 --> 02:03:04,600
but he was trying to get rid of it,
but he could have just for,

2211
02:03:04,640 --> 02:03:08,210
he could have let them foreclose on that,
you know? I mean, he just didn't want,

2212
02:03:08,480 --> 02:03:13,040
he didn't want the shame of losing the
home. And by the way, he still had money.

2213
02:03:13,100 --> 02:03:14,300
He wasn't destitute.

2214
02:03:14,450 --> 02:03:17,560
It was not like we're talking about Robin
Williams is living in some fucking no,

2215
02:03:17,561 --> 02:03:19,730
no. He's bag motel somewhere. Set himself.

2216
02:03:19,731 --> 02:03:21,990
He took the TV Gig for
the money short did. Yeah.

2217
02:03:21,991 --> 02:03:25,880
Because he wanted to keep his
lifestyle the way it was. And look,

2218
02:03:26,810 --> 02:03:30,410
it's still fucking TV gig. It's not like
someone told him to work in a coal mine.

2219
02:03:30,470 --> 02:03:34,660
No, no, no. I'm not CBS. I get
that. Yeah, no, I can. I mean,

2220
02:03:34,670 --> 02:03:37,190
it's a great job and it failed.

2221
02:03:37,250 --> 02:03:41,180
And one of the reasons why it failed
had nothing to do with his ex wife and

2222
02:03:41,181 --> 02:03:44,090
nothing people said that
he looked like he was sad.

2223
02:03:44,360 --> 02:03:47,600
Like people watch the sitcoms said
that he looked tired, he looked sad.

2224
02:03:47,601 --> 02:03:51,290
He didn't have the energetic persona
that everyone who he was, except he,

2225
02:03:51,291 --> 02:03:53,150
it was a downsizing to him.

2226
02:03:53,390 --> 02:03:57,530
And it was a downsizing professionally
in a way that's embarrassing to many film

2227
02:03:57,531 --> 02:04:01,820
actors when film actors go from
film to television, it's a loss.

2228
02:04:02,050 --> 02:04:06,350
And it's so hilarious, like it's like my
God, you're on fucking television show.

2229
02:04:06,351 --> 02:04:10,010
But the hierarchy of of stars is no.

2230
02:04:10,040 --> 02:04:13,880
If Jack Nicholson all sudden started doing
a sitcom, everybody be like, oh, check.

2231
02:04:14,300 --> 02:04:17,870
But if I come down right, but if I
did a sitcom, everybody be like, Hey,

2232
02:04:17,871 --> 02:04:20,000
congratulations on your comp.
You know what I mean?

2233
02:04:20,150 --> 02:04:24,070
It's not a consolation prize for you,
but it would be d level celebrity.

2234
02:04:24,071 --> 02:04:29,030
So if I did a sitcom, it would be,
you know, it'd be a bump up I B a c,

2235
02:04:29,170 --> 02:04:31,280
you know, you know what I'm
saying? But with an Aa guy,

2236
02:04:31,281 --> 02:04:36,230
like Robin Williams does a Sitcom, all
of a sudden he's a B or whatever. Right?

2237
02:04:36,620 --> 02:04:38,070
Now let's just start hierarchy

2238
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:39,180
of things.
To be fair,

2239
02:04:39,181 --> 02:04:42,870
I also talked a lot about the stuff
that happened in his childhood that he

2240
02:04:42,871 --> 02:04:47,700
himself had talked about that uh, he
felt that he had to be, what I call it,

2241
02:04:47,701 --> 02:04:51,210
the me plus, you know, like in
order to get people's attention,

2242
02:04:51,211 --> 02:04:54,030
in order to get their positive response,
I can't just be me.

2243
02:04:54,031 --> 02:04:56,910
I have to be me with a show.
I have to be me with money.

2244
02:04:56,911 --> 02:04:59,460
I have to be me with good looks. I
have whatever it's going to be. Right.

2245
02:05:00,270 --> 02:05:02,230
And I think that stuff comes out of,
uh,

2246
02:05:02,420 --> 02:05:04,140
I think that stuff came
out of his childhood.

2247
02:05:04,170 --> 02:05:06,390
Now that you can't be
definitive about that stuff.

2248
02:05:06,391 --> 02:05:09,810
I would love to have chatted with him,
but sadly that never will happen. But, um,

2249
02:05:10,380 --> 02:05:13,710
I think that stuff came out of a lot
of his, uh, his childhood issues.

2250
02:05:13,740 --> 02:05:16,950
And I think that's really tragic.
And I really wanted to, you know,

2251
02:05:16,951 --> 02:05:21,450
there is no external solution to the
problem of insecurity to the problems of

2252
02:05:21,451 --> 02:05:26,000
feeling unlovable to the problems of
feeling not enough people will try,

2253
02:05:26,040 --> 02:05:27,300
I think until the end of time.

2254
02:05:27,301 --> 02:05:30,360
It seems like people would try to stop
the holes in their heart with whatever

2255
02:05:30,361 --> 02:05:33,690
they can grab from talent or money
your looks or fame or whatever it is.

2256
02:05:34,250 --> 02:05:36,540
But it really, you know, I've
really tried to urge people,

2257
02:05:36,541 --> 02:05:40,560
you have to look inside and deal with
that stuff in a very proactive way, uh,

2258
02:05:40,710 --> 02:05:43,950
because the idea that you can just
basically glue eyeballs of attention to

2259
02:05:43,951 --> 02:05:47,430
yourself and become whole I think
is a very dangerous myth on there.

2260
02:05:47,540 --> 02:05:49,040
It is a very dangerous math,

2261
02:05:49,041 --> 02:05:52,130
but it's also what propels
great comics to become great.

2262
02:05:52,160 --> 02:05:55,280
And that's where it's ironic
that a guy like Robin Williams,

2263
02:05:55,281 --> 02:05:58,340
his horrific childhood, it wasn't
horrific. It just wasn't good.

2264
02:05:58,730 --> 02:06:03,140
But that childhood, I mean,
he was wealthy. He is, it
was just ignored. But that,

2265
02:06:03,170 --> 02:06:08,170
that the lack that he had in his
childhood was what led him to be this

2266
02:06:08,720 --> 02:06:13,460
magnanimous, just energetic, explosive.
Like, look at me, look at me.

2267
02:06:13,970 --> 02:06:18,260
And he was just look at me guy, because
no one was looking at him. You know,

2268
02:06:18,261 --> 02:06:22,040
I know this from my own personal
experience of becoming a standup comedian.

2269
02:06:22,041 --> 02:06:22,874
My parents were,

2270
02:06:23,120 --> 02:06:26,150
they broke up when I was five years
old and my father was very physically

2271
02:06:26,151 --> 02:06:29,670
abusive, violent, very
terrifying. And then, you know,

2272
02:06:29,810 --> 02:06:32,810
my stepfather was very young when my
parents got together. And there's like,

2273
02:06:33,020 --> 02:06:37,130
I was ignored a lot, you know, and
that's what led me to become a fighter.

2274
02:06:37,210 --> 02:06:39,530
It a part of is being bullied.
I was small.

2275
02:06:39,770 --> 02:06:44,770
And the other part was what led me to
become a comic was this lack of attention.

2276
02:06:45,710 --> 02:06:48,470
And I figured out a way to,

2277
02:06:48,500 --> 02:06:52,390
to manage it and I figured out a way with,
you know,

2278
02:06:52,430 --> 02:06:57,430
constant objective analysis of myself
constantly pushing myself towards new

2279
02:06:58,881 --> 02:07:02,840
goals, constant research. It's in,

2280
02:07:02,860 --> 02:07:06,560
in terms of like psychology,
in terms of philosophy,

2281
02:07:06,561 --> 02:07:08,270
in terms of meditation,

2282
02:07:08,271 --> 02:07:13,130
in terms of psychedelic experiences and
all sorts of different things that I've

2283
02:07:13,220 --> 02:07:17,360
done to try to manage my
own particular insanity.

2284
02:07:17,361 --> 02:07:22,160
But my particular insanity
was more manageable than
someone who's a drug addict.

2285
02:07:22,640 --> 02:07:25,780
The people that are drug addicts
with that particular insanity.

2286
02:07:25,900 --> 02:07:30,170
The real problem is you're also creating
this massive chemical imbalance in your

2287
02:07:30,171 --> 02:07:32,330
main, and I could be argued
that I've been drug addicts,

2288
02:07:32,331 --> 02:07:34,160
some people set up my drug
addict because I liked pot.

2289
02:07:34,760 --> 02:07:39,360
But I disagree because I
don't smoke it every day.

2290
02:07:39,370 --> 02:07:43,150
And I have quit for weeks on end and
it doesn't bother me. I like pot.

2291
02:07:43,390 --> 02:07:48,270
I think it's like saying I'm a coffee
addict or I'm an I'm a dick in the coffee

2292
02:07:48,300 --> 02:07:52,150
again. Nope, you can take my coffee. I'm
not addicted to stake, but I love it.

2293
02:07:52,170 --> 02:07:57,040
You know, I love weed too. I think
it's a beautiful calming, insightful,

2294
02:07:57,310 --> 02:08:01,430
introspective drug. I think it makes
food taste better. I think it's,

2295
02:08:01,431 --> 02:08:04,990
there's a lot of benefits to it as
far as the way you deal with people.

2296
02:08:04,991 --> 02:08:07,510
It makes you more compassionate and
I believe it makes you more creative.

2297
02:08:07,511 --> 02:08:10,540
I think it's a tool that mother
nature has given human beings,

2298
02:08:10,541 --> 02:08:15,540
but it's not a physically addictive in,
in terms of the,

2299
02:08:15,560 --> 02:08:18,790
what it does to your neurochemistry
and what it dumps it does to,

2300
02:08:18,791 --> 02:08:23,260
your body's like actual need for it,
where you have to go in a fucking rehab.

2301
02:08:23,260 --> 02:08:27,130
If you go into Rehab for weed,
you're either some sort of a weird case,

2302
02:08:27,370 --> 02:08:30,640
like one of those people that's a
allergic to sweat or something like that.

2303
02:08:31,330 --> 02:08:34,130
Or you know, there are people
that are allergic to their wives,

2304
02:08:34,160 --> 02:08:37,840
the wives who are allergic to their
husband's sperm. I've heard of this.

2305
02:08:38,320 --> 02:08:40,930
That's not just a line. Yeah,
that's, that's what I would say.

2306
02:08:40,931 --> 02:08:43,580
I would say it's a time, but
no, it is true. Are there,

2307
02:08:43,630 --> 02:08:48,280
there's medical proof that some women
are actually allergic to their husband's

2308
02:08:48,281 --> 02:08:51,400
sperm, allegedly. What am
I a doctor? Medical proof.

2309
02:08:51,820 --> 02:08:56,820
But my point is Robin had a physical
addiction to chemicals without a doubt.

2310
02:08:57,850 --> 02:09:01,150
And one of the big ones was cocaine.
He did a fuck load of cocaine.

2311
02:09:01,600 --> 02:09:04,400
And I personally have had,
um,

2312
02:09:04,720 --> 02:09:08,770
several friends that have had real
problems with cocaine and it is a Goddamn

2313
02:09:08,771 --> 02:09:12,370
rollercoaster ride.
And the downs are awful.

2314
02:09:12,430 --> 02:09:14,620
And when they go up, you know, they're,

2315
02:09:14,621 --> 02:09:17,550
they're riding this manic
wave and when they crashed,

2316
02:09:17,560 --> 02:09:21,910
they are fucking day are just miserable.

2317
02:09:21,911 --> 02:09:23,500
It's horrible to watch.

2318
02:09:23,860 --> 02:09:27,700
The best way to keep people from doing
coke is to put them around someone who's

2319
02:09:27,701 --> 02:09:32,701
done coke because it is just seeing how
fucked up they are when they're high and

2320
02:09:32,711 --> 02:09:35,620
seeing how low they are when they're low.
And you know,

2321
02:09:35,621 --> 02:09:39,820
that that was without a doubt, a problem
with Robin. He filled up his whole,

2322
02:09:39,821 --> 02:09:43,600
not just with the tension, but he
did it with hardcore damaging drugs.

2323
02:09:44,240 --> 02:09:47,360
And there's, uh, there's
this Vancouver physician, um,

2324
02:09:47,480 --> 02:09:51,950
I can recommend your listeners to check
out his book. His name is [inaudible], m,

2325
02:09:51,951 --> 02:09:56,870
a, t, e, and he's written a book called
in the realm of hungry ghosts. And, uh,

2326
02:09:56,871 --> 02:10:01,160
he's, uh, specializes in treating
people with significant drug addictions.

2327
02:10:01,161 --> 02:10:05,870
He's a doctor in Vancouver's drug area,
drug district and so on.

2328
02:10:05,900 --> 02:10:08,210
And, uh, he sort of noticed
this pattern that the,

2329
02:10:08,211 --> 02:10:12,380
particularly the women who were heroin
addicts had all been sexually abused as

2330
02:10:12,381 --> 02:10:12,771
children.

2331
02:10:12,771 --> 02:10:17,690
And you noticed this relationship between
childhood trauma and Adult Addiction.

2332
02:10:17,720 --> 02:10:21,530
And this book, uh, I won't obviously do
any kind of justice summarizing it here,

2333
02:10:21,531 --> 02:10:24,320
but it goes into,
and I've had him on the show too,

2334
02:10:24,321 --> 02:10:27,590
but it goes into a significant amount
of detail about the biochemistry of

2335
02:10:27,591 --> 02:10:29,270
addiction that generally,

2336
02:10:29,271 --> 02:10:34,271
if people have gone through these very
hard childhoods and neglect is underrated

2337
02:10:34,611 --> 02:10:38,120
as far as how harmful it
can be for, for someone, uh,

2338
02:10:38,121 --> 02:10:40,220
which is why children act
out in order to get hit.

2339
02:10:40,250 --> 02:10:43,910
They'd rather get hit than being
neglected, uh, for, for, for in many ways.

2340
02:10:44,660 --> 02:10:49,430
And his basic idea is that when you
have a, a neglected or abused childhood,

2341
02:10:50,020 --> 02:10:53,840
the, your brain is missing particular
receptors for certain chemicals.

2342
02:10:53,870 --> 02:10:57,890
And then when you take drugs,
you begin normal.

2343
02:10:57,980 --> 02:11:00,100
You feel normal because you,

2344
02:11:00,101 --> 02:11:02,750
you finally feel what it's like what
everyone else feels who didn't have those

2345
02:11:02,751 --> 02:11:06,800
kinds of childhoods. And that's why the
addiction is so strongly their, you know,

2346
02:11:06,980 --> 02:11:10,010
personal, regular happiness. Like just
make up a number of happen as hundred.

2347
02:11:10,190 --> 02:11:11,660
They'd take coke,
they go to one 50,

2348
02:11:11,661 --> 02:11:14,060
they go back down to 95 and
then they settle around that.

2349
02:11:14,390 --> 02:11:17,300
But somebody has got to happen as of 30.
They go to one 10.

2350
02:11:17,301 --> 02:11:20,960
They feel like normal happiness and what
everyone else feels for the first time.

2351
02:11:20,961 --> 02:11:24,050
And then when they crash
back down their life,

2352
02:11:24,051 --> 02:11:26,420
which formerly was just
normal now feels unbearable.

2353
02:11:26,421 --> 02:11:30,770
And that's one of the reasons why there's
this drive for addiction. Uh, and, uh,

2354
02:11:30,771 --> 02:11:33,320
I did a whole speech of this
sorta college in Canada recently,

2355
02:11:33,321 --> 02:11:34,340
so I won't go into the details,

2356
02:11:34,341 --> 02:11:38,960
but I think there is a lot of ways
in which you can see really difficult

2357
02:11:38,961 --> 02:11:43,961
childhoods producing a brains that are
very susceptible to getting the REApps

2358
02:11:44,090 --> 02:11:47,360
from external substances that should be
naturally occurring but didn't develop

2359
02:11:47,361 --> 02:11:48,710
as a result of childhood trauma.

2360
02:11:48,810 --> 02:11:51,960
No question whatsoever.
And we're learning more [inaudible] we,

2361
02:11:51,961 --> 02:11:55,490
they are learning the people that study
that are learning more about that every

2362
02:11:55,491 --> 02:11:58,230
day and it's a fairly new
science over the last, you know,

2363
02:11:58,380 --> 02:12:02,400
x amount of decades they've just started
sorta delve into these responses and

2364
02:12:02,401 --> 02:12:07,170
then understanding genes and understanding
how you could actually pass on

2365
02:12:07,171 --> 02:12:11,700
depression and pass on these tours, sorts
of behavior patterns to your children.

2366
02:12:12,090 --> 02:12:16,680
And a guy like Robin Williams
clearly had demons and I,

2367
02:12:17,370 --> 02:12:21,900
there was, there was many,
many, many, many issues. The
divorce part was something,

2368
02:12:22,110 --> 02:12:24,390
it was definitely something,
but you know,

2369
02:12:24,391 --> 02:12:28,560
it bothered me listening to you talk
about that because I've had friends that

2370
02:12:28,561 --> 02:12:30,820
were depressed. I know that, you know,

2371
02:12:31,770 --> 02:12:36,770
it's going very clearly
against the current of modern
medical thinking in which

2372
02:12:39,121 --> 02:12:44,121
recognizes depression as a disease to
say that this guy was killed because of

2373
02:12:45,060 --> 02:12:48,340
divorce. You know, when he died, he still
had millions of dollars. It wasn't, yeah.

2374
02:12:48,410 --> 02:12:50,660
Well, you know, and I think
in listening to you talk,

2375
02:12:50,750 --> 02:12:52,340
I think I will retract what I said.

2376
02:12:52,430 --> 02:12:54,790
I think I went too far
in saying that that was,

2377
02:12:54,800 --> 02:12:58,000
if I said that that was the sole
course, that's, that's wrong. Yeah. I,

2378
02:12:58,010 --> 02:13:01,940
I can't definitively say of course, that
that was the sole cause. So for those, uh,

2379
02:13:02,050 --> 02:13:03,920
foot hope for saying, if I
said that, I'm sure I did.

2380
02:13:03,921 --> 02:13:06,380
You've listened to it more recently than
I have then. Yeah, I would track that.

2381
02:13:06,381 --> 02:13:07,200
That's going too far.

2382
02:13:07,200 --> 02:13:11,730
You think you just got worked up
over this idea of a alimony, this,

2383
02:13:11,731 --> 02:13:16,170
this idea, which I agree with you
that it's, it's a very strange thing.

2384
02:13:16,171 --> 02:13:19,080
And the way you put it I think was a
good way that you said that if people get

2385
02:13:19,081 --> 02:13:23,670
fired from a job, you know, you
don't get fired and say, well,

2386
02:13:23,671 --> 02:13:27,750
I still want money. I want you to continue
to pay me even though I've been fired.

2387
02:13:27,870 --> 02:13:30,520
But if someone is married,
um,

2388
02:13:30,720 --> 02:13:33,720
I have friend who was married and
I talked about this yesterday,

2389
02:13:33,721 --> 02:13:37,050
but I'll briefly, he, uh, his wife,

2390
02:13:37,080 --> 02:13:39,300
not only did she divorce him,

2391
02:13:39,301 --> 02:13:43,230
but she planned it out for several
months and went to all the best divorce

2392
02:13:43,231 --> 02:13:46,920
attorneys and consulted with them so that
he couldn't consult with them because

2393
02:13:46,921 --> 02:13:51,750
it would be a conflict of interest. And
she, uh, they don't have any children,

2394
02:13:52,050 --> 02:13:54,390
but they were married for a while and,
uh,

2395
02:13:54,450 --> 02:13:56,550
she will never get married
again because she did,

2396
02:13:56,551 --> 02:13:58,530
she wouldn't receive these payments.

2397
02:13:58,560 --> 02:14:02,640
So she has her boyfriend living in his
old house and when they send inspectors

2398
02:14:02,641 --> 02:14:05,370
over there, the guy moves
out. He gets a shit out,

2399
02:14:05,371 --> 02:14:08,940
like weights around the corner with a u
haul. She calls them, the inspectors gone.

2400
02:14:08,941 --> 02:14:11,790
He turns around and you know,
my friend knows about it. He,

2401
02:14:11,800 --> 02:14:15,960
and it drives me fucking crazy because
he worked 12 hours a day while she was at

2402
02:14:15,961 --> 02:14:19,500
home doing Jack Shit. She never had
a kid, had a little dog, you know,

2403
02:14:19,501 --> 02:14:20,400
the whole deal,
you know,

2404
02:14:20,401 --> 02:14:23,670
got her nails done every day and he's
just a fucking workaholic maniac.

2405
02:14:23,671 --> 02:14:27,090
And she benefited from it greatly.
And to this day,

2406
02:14:27,091 --> 02:14:31,680
his lifestyle is impaired because he
has to send her money and he's not Robin

2407
02:14:31,680 --> 02:14:34,740
Williams, he's not making that kind of
money. He, he did very well for himself,

2408
02:14:34,741 --> 02:14:39,720
but the guy earned every fucking
penny with labor. I mean,

2409
02:14:39,721 --> 02:14:44,721
he's a hard worker and he's got this
fucking ex wife that's an anchor tied to

2410
02:14:44,881 --> 02:14:48,510
his neck and uh, he can't get
free of it no matter what he does.

2411
02:14:48,710 --> 02:14:51,950
It's something Norman Mailer you
American writer, he said, uh, he said,

2412
02:14:51,951 --> 02:14:56,330
you never know your wife till you meet
her in court. And I think, you know,

2413
02:14:56,420 --> 02:14:58,910
I think that's pretty cynical
for all wives, but uh,

2414
02:14:59,240 --> 02:15:01,070
I think he's the guy who
stabbed his wife and he said,

2415
02:15:01,071 --> 02:15:03,620
as long as you're still using a knife,
there's still some love there.

2416
02:15:04,550 --> 02:15:07,730
It's only a knife. But no, I
think that the alimony thing,

2417
02:15:07,731 --> 02:15:11,600
it's funny because it actually is pretty
not that common throughout history.

2418
02:15:11,601 --> 02:15:14,930
It really came out of the Catholic
Church until death do us part. You can't,

2419
02:15:15,230 --> 02:15:15,441
right.

2420
02:15:15,441 --> 02:15:18,770
The reason that the alimony
thing basically got its
root in western common law

2421
02:15:18,771 --> 02:15:22,190
was because the Catholic Church didn't
allow divorce and so people would just

2422
02:15:22,191 --> 02:15:24,080
kind of separate the way it used to work.

2423
02:15:24,081 --> 02:15:26,320
As you take a dowery for marrying a woman,
if you're devoted,

2424
02:15:26,350 --> 02:15:28,130
you had to give the dowery back.
But that was about it.

2425
02:15:28,580 --> 02:15:32,330
But then this idea of until death do us
part kind of came out of the Catholic

2426
02:15:32,330 --> 02:15:33,980
Church and that's sort of
where it came from. And uh,

2427
02:15:34,490 --> 02:15:36,470
it is brutal and he has some
people got upset and say,

2428
02:15:36,471 --> 02:15:39,020
well are you saying that being a
wife was only a job? Well, kind of.

2429
02:15:39,021 --> 02:15:40,910
And being a husband is kind of a job too,
right?

2430
02:15:40,911 --> 02:15:43,880
I mean there is a financial
aspect to marriage that, you know,

2431
02:15:43,881 --> 02:15:48,710
it's foolish to ignore and um, I think
it is a, I think it is pretty terrible.

2432
02:15:48,800 --> 02:15:51,770
I think that's also something that breaks
up a lot of families too because um,

2433
02:15:52,210 --> 02:15:54,890
uh, more than half of people
who are considering divorce,

2434
02:15:54,891 --> 02:15:58,680
if they stick it out five years later,
they say, I'm really glad I did. You know,

2435
02:15:58,700 --> 02:16:03,320
there's a lot of um, uh, people
who go through challenges,
rough spots, tough spots,

2436
02:16:03,321 --> 02:16:06,200
transitions. You never know
you get sick or, or you know,

2437
02:16:06,201 --> 02:16:08,240
you lose some money or you lose your job.
But I mean,

2438
02:16:08,241 --> 02:16:10,940
things can happen that are really tough.
People have affairs and,

2439
02:16:11,300 --> 02:16:14,930
but the majority of people who stick
out their marriages, and again,

2440
02:16:14,931 --> 02:16:16,400
it's not like 99%,

2441
02:16:16,401 --> 02:16:19,300
but certainly more than 50 majority people
who stick out there and he would just

2442
02:16:19,301 --> 02:16:22,160
yell or we're very happy that they
did. I hate using those terms. It's

2443
02:16:22,160 --> 02:16:22,520
terms,

2444
02:16:22,520 --> 02:16:25,790
I hate saying the majority of when you're
dealing with individual relationships,

2445
02:16:25,791 --> 02:16:30,130
because they vary so widely that I don't
think that you can really narrow them

2446
02:16:30,131 --> 02:16:31,630
down to statistics.

2447
02:16:31,631 --> 02:16:36,631
I think every individual interaction
between two unique people is unique in and

2448
02:16:36,941 --> 02:16:38,710
of itself.
And that person,

2449
02:16:38,740 --> 02:16:41,830
I'm different with my wife than I've
been with anybody I've ever dated.

2450
02:16:42,130 --> 02:16:44,860
And I think that that's
how it is with most people.

2451
02:16:44,861 --> 02:16:47,620
Sometimes you find someone who's
compatible and it works great for you,

2452
02:16:47,621 --> 02:16:50,380
but there's other times
where you're thinking about
getting away from them where

2453
02:16:50,410 --> 02:16:53,320
that's probably the best fucking
decision you could ever make.

2454
02:16:53,710 --> 02:16:56,200
And I know people that say,
why does divorce cost so much?

2455
02:16:56,201 --> 02:17:00,280
Cause it's fucking worth it. You know?
There's a lot of people think that too.

2456
02:17:00,360 --> 02:17:02,590
Yeah.
I agree with you though,

2457
02:17:02,620 --> 02:17:07,620
that there are some ridiculous alimony
settlements that are just unreasonable

2458
02:17:07,691 --> 02:17:09,760
and don't make any fucking
sense why as well. And Europe,

2459
02:17:10,270 --> 02:17:12,760
I mean really no such thing. Yeah. Like,

2460
02:17:12,790 --> 02:17:16,030
and people can check out the movie divorce
Corp, I felt like I'm having to wait.

2461
02:17:16,060 --> 02:17:17,260
I don't get any money from this stuff,

2462
02:17:17,261 --> 02:17:20,740
but I think it's a good movie and they
sort of compare what goes on in Europe.

2463
02:17:20,741 --> 02:17:21,574
So in Europe,

2464
02:17:21,600 --> 02:17:25,390
the worst that can happen is you have to
pay alimony during the period that the

2465
02:17:25,391 --> 02:17:27,430
divorce is going through it.
But once it's done, it's done.

2466
02:17:27,460 --> 02:17:30,610
Now they can't be child support and so
on. But it's not much. It's a weird thing,

2467
02:17:30,880 --> 02:17:35,380
this idea that once a woman has separated
from her husband that she's no longer

2468
02:17:35,381 --> 02:17:38,620
able to live her life as an independent.
That's so strange.

2469
02:17:38,621 --> 02:17:43,300
I don't understand how that ever came to
be and this idea that you have to keep

2470
02:17:43,301 --> 02:17:48,010
her in the same fashion and style and
the style in which she has become a cast.

2471
02:17:48,010 --> 02:17:50,050
That's so crazy. Like, if you,

2472
02:17:50,410 --> 02:17:54,940
if you're a woman and you are used to
being a waitress and you're used to living

2473
02:17:54,941 --> 02:17:56,860
in an apartment and there's
nothing wrong with that.

2474
02:17:56,861 --> 02:18:00,540
And then all of a sudden you meet some
guy who's some real estate mogul who's

2475
02:18:00,550 --> 02:18:04,600
worth $1 billion and he puts you up in
his Beverly hills mansion and you live

2476
02:18:04,601 --> 02:18:06,260
with them for a year and you get married.
Uh,

2477
02:18:06,330 --> 02:18:10,840
should you discount the 30 years of your
life that you lived as a waitress or

2478
02:18:10,841 --> 02:18:15,700
should there be an average, you know, like
one of the things that we talked about,

2479
02:18:15,720 --> 02:18:19,240
um, the last time we were
here was, um, we were,

2480
02:18:19,241 --> 02:18:22,990
we were talking about poverty and we're
talking about people in poverty work

2481
02:18:23,140 --> 02:18:24,640
shockingly small amount.

2482
02:18:24,910 --> 02:18:27,760
And you were saying that people that
built live below the poverty line work an

2483
02:18:27,761 --> 02:18:32,620
average of 16 hours a week. And my
argument to two people, two people,

2484
02:18:32,621 --> 02:18:36,370
people in my argument with that is
also of course that you're dealing with

2485
02:18:36,371 --> 02:18:38,650
people that mostly are unemployed.

2486
02:18:38,651 --> 02:18:42,610
So if you have one person works 80
hours a week, one person works zero,

2487
02:18:42,940 --> 02:18:45,710
you meet those two in the middle and the,
you find out what the averages.

2488
02:18:45,760 --> 02:18:49,060
So it's not like most people would just
saying, oh, I want to work one day a week.

2489
02:18:49,090 --> 02:18:53,470
Most of them were unemployed.
And when you're dealing with something,

2490
02:18:53,471 --> 02:18:56,470
when it comes to like alimony,
when you, you want it,

2491
02:18:56,500 --> 02:18:58,480
someone in the style of
had been accustomed to,

2492
02:18:58,630 --> 02:19:01,510
you should take into account their
whole fucking life. You know,

2493
02:19:01,511 --> 02:19:03,970
you shouldn't take into account the
style they've been accustomed to over the

2494
02:19:03,971 --> 02:19:08,320
last 12 months living with this crazy
rich guy, right? Like that's preposterous.

2495
02:19:08,550 --> 02:19:10,900
The idea that somehow or another,

2496
02:19:11,080 --> 02:19:15,760
this man that you married who's worth
$1 billion that you helped earn him,

2497
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:19,030
you know, half of what he made during
the year that you were together.

2498
02:19:19,120 --> 02:19:22,450
Where's the evidence that you've ever
been successful at making that kind of

2499
02:19:22,451 --> 02:19:25,390
money in the past? Why should you
be entitled to that kind of money?

2500
02:19:25,600 --> 02:19:27,830
And I think the same is true with men.

2501
02:19:27,980 --> 02:19:31,160
When Kevin Federline was
married to Britney spears,

2502
02:19:31,370 --> 02:19:33,800
that mother fucker never made a nickel.
Okay.

2503
02:19:33,801 --> 02:19:36,490
And I've seen him drive a
Ferrari and that fat bitch

2504
02:19:36,570 --> 02:19:40,690
didn't earn that Ferrari on his own. He
ended off the bat getting his rap career.

2505
02:19:42,560 --> 02:19:45,860
I think at least for you, I'd like to,
unfortunately, it's burned into my brain.

2506
02:19:45,861 --> 02:19:48,050
It's the whitest thing I've ever seen.
There's two cases,

2507
02:19:48,080 --> 02:19:51,230
Kevin Federline and Tom Arnold,
we won on both of those cases.

2508
02:19:51,231 --> 02:19:53,030
Those cases are all men.
But remember,

2509
02:19:53,031 --> 02:19:57,660
it's only 3% of alimony payments
are men to women. Sorry,
women. Women to men. Yeah.

2510
02:19:58,030 --> 02:20:00,110
And,
and it $10 billion a year.

2511
02:20:00,111 --> 02:20:02,780
It's a $10 billion and billion
a year in money transfer thing.

2512
02:20:03,410 --> 02:20:06,200
It's pretty brutal. I think it's brutal
on man. And I think it's brutal on women.

2513
02:20:06,201 --> 02:20:10,250
I mean, free stuff is, it's bad
for the brain unless you were like,

2514
02:20:10,330 --> 02:20:14,450
it's fabulous soul for the soul, you
know, free stuff a again, hey, you know,

2515
02:20:14,460 --> 02:20:17,570
I mean you, you're injured, you know,
absolutely charity and all that.

2516
02:20:17,571 --> 02:20:20,000
But the focus on free stuff,

2517
02:20:20,001 --> 02:20:23,930
I think a personality is like a
muscle. It needs resistance. You know,

2518
02:20:23,931 --> 02:20:26,930
you need to have challenges in life
actually wanted if you have another topic.

2519
02:20:27,370 --> 02:20:28,370
No, no, no. We can go on.

2520
02:20:28,700 --> 02:20:31,820
So one of the questions I get quite a
lot and in my colon shows is people who

2521
02:20:31,821 --> 02:20:35,030
say, I lack motivation. I like, you know,

2522
02:20:35,031 --> 02:20:37,250
I don't know what I don't want to do
with my life and I want you to get your

2523
02:20:37,251 --> 02:20:42,251
thoughts because you seem to be a guy
who's almost vibrating with work and

2524
02:20:42,651 --> 02:20:45,860
projects and you know, like you're
like this tuning fork that never stops.

2525
02:20:46,760 --> 02:20:50,960
What do you think is it that really
gets your juices going and gets you

2526
02:20:50,961 --> 02:20:55,100
committed and focused on achieving
the things that you achieve? Well,

2527
02:20:55,101 --> 02:20:55,934
I don't think

2528
02:20:56,020 --> 02:20:58,690
in terms of achievement,
I think of it in terms of interests.

2529
02:20:58,750 --> 02:21:02,890
What things fascinate me. You know,
I'm fascinated by martial arts.

2530
02:21:02,891 --> 02:21:07,690
I'm fascinated by comedy. I'm fascinated
by many, many different things.

2531
02:21:07,750 --> 02:21:12,280
I don't understand when people say
they're bored because if I had the time to

2532
02:21:12,281 --> 02:21:15,400
live a hundred lives,
I'd be speaking different languages.

2533
02:21:15,401 --> 02:21:17,020
I'd be living in different countries.
I would,

2534
02:21:17,080 --> 02:21:20,200
I would try a number of different
careers because I think there's a lot of

2535
02:21:20,560 --> 02:21:22,900
unbelievably fascinating,
puzzling,

2536
02:21:22,930 --> 02:21:25,390
complex things that you
could study in this world.

2537
02:21:25,910 --> 02:21:27,610
That's just me and my personality,

2538
02:21:27,611 --> 02:21:30,270
but that's a personality also
that have cultivated over years.

2539
02:21:30,300 --> 02:21:31,710
What do you like that as a kid too?

2540
02:21:31,930 --> 02:21:34,120
While I was involved in
martial arts very early,

2541
02:21:34,180 --> 02:21:39,180
and I think that is one of the things
that motivated me to explore difficult

2542
02:21:39,881 --> 02:21:42,820
tasks because through difficult tasks,

2543
02:21:42,821 --> 02:21:47,821
you learn an incredible amount about
yourself and you through through the fire

2544
02:21:47,861 --> 02:21:50,050
of competition,
you get to understand,

2545
02:21:50,680 --> 02:21:52,990
you get to understand motivation.

2546
02:21:52,990 --> 02:21:56,230
You get to understand the resistance
that you have inside your mind to doing

2547
02:21:56,250 --> 02:21:59,470
hard work. You get to understand
the rewards of discipline.

2548
02:21:59,680 --> 02:22:04,060
Like you don't truly appreciate
relaxation unless you've worked hard.

2549
02:22:04,290 --> 02:22:07,520
And that is the Yin and the Yang of life.
And I've said this to,

2550
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:11,440
to the point of people getting sick of it,

2551
02:22:11,441 --> 02:22:14,620
but one of the worst
decisions a man can make,

2552
02:22:14,680 --> 02:22:18,130
I can only speak for men obviously,
um, is to be comfortable.

2553
02:22:18,460 --> 02:22:20,740
I don't think you should
try to be comfortable.

2554
02:22:20,770 --> 02:22:24,670
I think what you should try to do
is try to earn comfort and if you,

2555
02:22:24,671 --> 02:22:27,090
if you get a day off where you you,

2556
02:22:27,120 --> 02:22:31,380
you've worked hard and you've accomplished
goals that day off, we'll be so sweet.

2557
02:22:31,560 --> 02:22:34,770
When I work hard and I sit in front
of the TV, I enjoy the shit out of it.

2558
02:22:34,980 --> 02:22:39,210
I put my feet up, I have a nice
drink, you know, I enjoy my free time.

2559
02:22:39,210 --> 02:22:42,200
It's your back or something like that.
One of those. Those are great. All right.

2560
02:22:42,220 --> 02:22:43,590
Right now I don't use it that much though.

2561
02:22:44,130 --> 02:22:47,790
Honestly I'm more of a workaholic
than I should be probably if, if the,

2562
02:22:47,800 --> 02:22:51,180
the balance was I probably
should relax more than I do,

2563
02:22:51,330 --> 02:22:52,650
but I never feel like I earned it,

2564
02:22:52,651 --> 02:22:55,530
but that's part of the reason why
when I do feel like I earned it,

2565
02:22:55,531 --> 02:22:56,364
I can enjoy it.

2566
02:22:56,750 --> 02:23:01,750
It's because I am more connected
to the idea that I need to,

2567
02:23:02,130 --> 02:23:04,590
to accomplish things and to,

2568
02:23:04,660 --> 02:23:09,180
and it's not like for anybody else has
benefit other than my own or anybody

2569
02:23:09,181 --> 02:23:13,800
else's approval other than my own. I just,
when I have a task, whether it's a I,

2570
02:23:13,801 --> 02:23:16,050
today I'm going to write a thousand words,
you know,

2571
02:23:16,051 --> 02:23:19,650
or 2000 or whatever the number is.
If I don't do that, I don't, I'm not,

2572
02:23:19,660 --> 02:23:20,730
I write things down,

2573
02:23:20,731 --> 02:23:23,160
like I'll write down the list of
things that get accomplished that day.

2574
02:23:23,430 --> 02:23:26,140
And if I don't accomplish
that, I'll get sick. Like I'll,

2575
02:23:26,150 --> 02:23:30,300
it'll drive me fucking crazy if I can't
fill out that list that drives me nuts,

2576
02:23:30,660 --> 02:23:35,490
you know? But that's what led me to be
a championship level martial artists.

2577
02:23:35,491 --> 02:23:38,580
That's what led me to achieve the,
it's like that.

2578
02:23:39,300 --> 02:23:42,570
It's the reinforcement of those goals,

2579
02:23:42,600 --> 02:23:46,470
like understanding that you can achieve
those goals, it's going to be difficult.

2580
02:23:46,471 --> 02:23:48,990
You're going to push through
the difficulty and then
you've got to understand

2581
02:23:48,991 --> 02:23:51,690
what difficulty truly is and
how much of it is just mental.

2582
02:23:51,691 --> 02:23:54,900
How much of it is just in your mind,
this adversity to,

2583
02:23:55,140 --> 02:23:59,760
to a difficult task or to struggle. You
know? And a lot of people have that,

2584
02:23:59,761 --> 02:24:02,820
they're scared, they're
scared of, of complications.

2585
02:24:02,821 --> 02:24:06,810
They're scared of failure. Failure is
a big one that people are afraid of.

2586
02:24:06,811 --> 02:24:10,020
But failure is one of the most important
things you could ever have as far as

2587
02:24:10,021 --> 02:24:12,000
like the motivation to
do things differently.

2588
02:24:12,450 --> 02:24:17,450
One of the reasons why I think that I'm
good at friendships and relationships is

2589
02:24:18,571 --> 02:24:20,340
because I failed at them in the past.

2590
02:24:20,341 --> 02:24:23,610
One of the things that I'm good at
comedies because I bombed on stage.

2591
02:24:23,850 --> 02:24:27,960
One of the reasons why I'm good at work
is because I've been a shitty worker in

2592
02:24:27,961 --> 02:24:32,130
the past and I know the feeling
of failure, the feeling of, uh,

2593
02:24:32,190 --> 02:24:36,750
of shame of being like a week
non-motivated lazy person.

2594
02:24:36,751 --> 02:24:40,440
It's a weak feeling. It's an you
don't respect yourself. You know,

2595
02:24:40,441 --> 02:24:43,890
and I have this phrase that I use all
the time to people to try to motivate

2596
02:24:43,891 --> 02:24:47,040
people. I say that, be the
hero in your own movie.

2597
02:24:47,130 --> 02:24:50,070
Pretend that if your life was a
movie and your life started now,

2598
02:24:50,100 --> 02:24:52,500
what would the hero do?
What would the person that you respect,

2599
02:24:52,570 --> 02:24:55,020
what would the person that you admire,
person that inspires you?

2600
02:24:55,020 --> 02:24:58,050
What would they do? We'll do
that shit. And if you do that,

2601
02:24:58,140 --> 02:25:03,000
you slowly build momentum. You like
today I did what I wanted to do today.

2602
02:25:03,210 --> 02:25:06,030
I started a class in Yoga,
I did this,

2603
02:25:06,031 --> 02:25:08,760
I did all these things that I was saying
I wasn't going to do and now I feel

2604
02:25:08,761 --> 02:25:13,620
momentum and momentum is a very
important point in people's lives.

2605
02:25:13,830 --> 02:25:16,260
That's why some folks don't like to take
days off because they feel like they're

2606
02:25:16,261 --> 02:25:20,220
losing momentum and they sort of have
to restart the wheel up again after a

2607
02:25:20,221 --> 02:25:22,620
vacation. It's like what they
say, if you want something done,

2608
02:25:22,621 --> 02:25:24,070
give it to the busy guy.
Yeah,

2609
02:25:24,100 --> 02:25:26,710
it's true because he's in motion.
He'll get some things done.

2610
02:25:26,810 --> 02:25:27,291
That's true.

2611
02:25:27,291 --> 02:25:31,550
There's certain people that I know that
just are lazy as fuck and they can never

2612
02:25:31,551 --> 02:25:34,310
get anything done. You're like, did you
do that thing? Nah, it was just getting,

2613
02:25:34,320 --> 02:25:36,830
didn't get to it. Like what are you
talking about? You didn't get to it.

2614
02:25:36,831 --> 02:25:37,664
What did you do?

2615
02:25:37,910 --> 02:25:41,440
You wear out instagraming pictures of
you at a strip club two days ago, right?

2616
02:25:41,540 --> 02:25:43,720
Like how the fuck did you
not get that done? Right?

2617
02:25:43,760 --> 02:25:45,440
Like you had all the time to
do all these other things,

2618
02:25:45,441 --> 02:25:48,170
but you don't have the time to do the
thing that's going to enhance your life.

2619
02:25:48,330 --> 02:25:51,710
It's going to benefit you, that's going
to move forward, your career, your life,

2620
02:25:51,711 --> 02:25:54,960
your prospects, your art, whatever
it is you're working on. You know?

2621
02:25:55,070 --> 02:25:56,510
And I think that it's,

2622
02:25:56,511 --> 02:25:59,840
it's hard for people because we
operate on the momentum of the past.

2623
02:25:59,841 --> 02:26:04,170
And a lot of times our past has been to
just fucking, just a graveyard, uh, uh,

2624
02:26:04,370 --> 02:26:08,330
just, uh, a wreck of
disasters one after the other.

2625
02:26:08,331 --> 02:26:11,420
And you look at that and you go,
well, that's who I am. I'm a failure.

2626
02:26:11,421 --> 02:26:14,300
I drank too much. I fall asleep
at work, I do this, I do that.

2627
02:26:14,350 --> 02:26:17,390
And we put kids in these schools where
they just sit there passively receiving

2628
02:26:17,391 --> 02:26:20,600
stuff rather than actively doing stuff.
And then we wonder why they may,

2629
02:26:20,601 --> 02:26:22,430
some of them lack motivation
when they get older.

2630
02:26:22,540 --> 02:26:25,070
And I think there's a big
problem in the fact that the,

2631
02:26:25,100 --> 02:26:30,100
the job of being a teacher should be
a revered position that's incredibly

2632
02:26:31,071 --> 02:26:34,670
difficult to earn.
I think it should be just like you know,

2633
02:26:34,700 --> 02:26:37,310
being someone who is in charge.

2634
02:26:37,340 --> 02:26:41,120
I mean being someone who is in charge
of the development of the mind of your

2635
02:26:41,121 --> 02:26:45,950
child is such an incredible
position and an incredible,

2636
02:26:46,640 --> 02:26:48,710
the just the,

2637
02:26:50,030 --> 02:26:55,030
the amount of responsibility involved
in influencing a young developing mind

2638
02:26:56,870 --> 02:26:59,240
can't be under overestimated.

2639
02:26:59,380 --> 02:27:01,680
Do you have teachers that you
remember when you were a kid? Yeah,

2640
02:27:01,690 --> 02:27:05,740
I do like good stand out like yeah,
like, like, like the sun in the sky.

2641
02:27:05,741 --> 02:27:07,130
You can't see any kind see any star.

2642
02:27:07,131 --> 02:27:10,060
I can't see the other teachers in my
head for the few good ones that I had.

2643
02:27:10,390 --> 02:27:11,830
What an incredible,
if they could all be like,

2644
02:27:11,831 --> 02:27:15,040
and obviously it'd be great but I mean
teach us. Yeah. Awesome responsibility.

2645
02:27:15,040 --> 02:27:16,540
Yeah.
I had some great ones.

2646
02:27:16,541 --> 02:27:20,440
I had a few great ones that were just
really good people that were smart and

2647
02:27:20,441 --> 02:27:23,370
kind and they, they, they profoundly,

2648
02:27:23,620 --> 02:27:26,740
I had a science teacher in seventh
grade that I had a discussion with him,

2649
02:27:26,741 --> 02:27:28,390
just me and him one day
and I never forgot it.

2650
02:27:28,440 --> 02:27:32,110
We were talking about space and he was
a really interesting guy. You know,

2651
02:27:32,111 --> 02:27:35,560
it was a bad neighborhood. We
lived in, I lived in Jamaica plain,

2652
02:27:35,561 --> 02:27:39,490
which was like this, um,
neighborhood in Boston,

2653
02:27:39,520 --> 02:27:42,520
just outside of, um, uh, Boston.

2654
02:27:42,521 --> 02:27:44,740
It's just a really shit
neighborhood at the time.

2655
02:27:44,741 --> 02:27:46,390
It's become a little bit gentrified now,

2656
02:27:46,391 --> 02:27:49,660
but back then it was just really sketchy,
very poor kids.

2657
02:27:49,661 --> 02:27:53,020
And there was a kid that was in my class,
I can't. So seventh grade eight went,

2658
02:27:53,021 --> 02:27:55,990
ninth is a high school is eighth grade
because it was right before high school.

2659
02:27:55,990 --> 02:27:59,050
And this kid was 17 years old
in the fucking eighth grade.

2660
02:27:59,470 --> 02:28:01,090
I mean it was crazy cause they were just,

2661
02:28:01,150 --> 02:28:03,490
they would be there for the beginning of
the year and then they would drop out.

2662
02:28:03,820 --> 02:28:08,350
And uh, the science teacher was, you
know, in this shit school system,

2663
02:28:08,590 --> 02:28:12,970
but he was just genuinely kind,
curious patient man.

2664
02:28:13,330 --> 02:28:15,740
And he talked to me about space and,

2665
02:28:15,840 --> 02:28:19,270
and I'd never considered the
idea that space is never ending.

2666
02:28:19,330 --> 02:28:23,750
And he was explaining the concept of
infinity to me and that there truly is no

2667
02:28:23,751 --> 02:28:25,770
boundary. And if you
really, I remember he said,

2668
02:28:25,790 --> 02:28:27,500
you ever really want
to make your head hurt?

2669
02:28:27,890 --> 02:28:32,810
Just stare at the sky and try to wrap
your head around the idea that it never

2670
02:28:32,811 --> 02:28:33,410
ends.

2671
02:28:33,410 --> 02:28:36,890
And we had this long conversation about
it and they inbetween classes one day,

2672
02:28:37,460 --> 02:28:39,210
not even a long, you
know, 10 minutes maybe,

2673
02:28:39,230 --> 02:28:43,700
but enough that I thought about that for
years to this day. I remember that guy

2674
02:28:44,430 --> 02:28:48,210
that's a great to Richard Fiman was
this a physicist, a fantastic guy.

2675
02:28:48,840 --> 02:28:51,420
And uh, he said, told about
his father that his, you know,

2676
02:28:51,421 --> 02:28:54,600
he was pulling some wagon and they hit
balls in the wagon. He said, you know,

2677
02:28:54,601 --> 02:28:56,580
it's when you pull the wagon,
the bowl stay for a bit,

2678
02:28:56,581 --> 02:28:59,010
and then they bump up and then you
stop the wagon. They keep going.

2679
02:28:59,011 --> 02:29:03,150
So he was talking about
momentum and physics and all
that. And so like all kids,

2680
02:29:03,151 --> 02:29:04,410
he said, well, why, why, why?

2681
02:29:04,411 --> 02:29:08,670
And then he got to a point with his
father where he said, well, why?

2682
02:29:08,850 --> 02:29:13,290
And his father said that nobody
knows. Like, why is that gravity?

2683
02:29:13,350 --> 02:29:15,700
I mean that nobody knows. And, uh,

2684
02:29:15,720 --> 02:29:20,520
I think those kinds of questions where
you really stimulate your mind I think is

2685
02:29:20,521 --> 02:29:21,360
a great idea.

2686
02:29:21,690 --> 02:29:25,720
I was telling my daughter a couple of
I made made two months ago about a,

2687
02:29:25,740 --> 02:29:27,950
there's an old Spanish
proverb that says, Whoa, um,

2688
02:29:28,080 --> 02:29:33,080
habits begin as cobwebs and end up
has chains way easier to break in the

2689
02:29:33,390 --> 02:29:36,030
beginning than later off. Right. Way To
put it. It's a great way to put it. Wow.

2690
02:29:36,120 --> 02:29:40,740
And uh, anyway, she just, she just
brought this up, uh, you know, um,

2691
02:29:41,230 --> 02:29:42,870
we were talking about
someone she knew and,

2692
02:29:42,871 --> 02:29:45,870
and to something that she didn't like
that they did and she said, yeah,

2693
02:29:45,871 --> 02:29:49,170
but they're still pretty much in the
cob web phase so they can probably still

2694
02:29:49,171 --> 02:29:52,020
change it at him. She was like, well, I
even, I didn't remember it. She was like,

2695
02:29:52,050 --> 02:29:54,030
Oh yeah, the cob webs and
change things. Like she really,

2696
02:29:54,120 --> 02:29:55,710
that sunk in her and she's like five.

2697
02:29:55,711 --> 02:29:59,520
And she can remember those things that
can really take you through life and give

2698
02:29:59,521 --> 02:30:01,590
you real clarity.
I think that stuff is great.

2699
02:30:01,591 --> 02:30:05,400
And I remember those people who gave me
those important lessons as, as a kid.

2700
02:30:05,740 --> 02:30:10,360
Yeah, that's a great statement. That's
a big one man. Cause that is so true.

2701
02:30:10,660 --> 02:30:14,320
If you can break them in the beginning
they say that if you do something for 90

2702
02:30:14,321 --> 02:30:18,910
days it, it can become a habit.
It becomes an ingrained, negative,

2703
02:30:19,660 --> 02:30:23,530
positive or negative as why I've run into
people that all of a sudden they just,

2704
02:30:23,531 --> 02:30:26,470
you look at them, they look great. I've
lost all this weight. Like what'd you do?

2705
02:30:26,471 --> 02:30:31,300
I just started every day doing
this. I started walking, I
started eating, you know,

2706
02:30:31,301 --> 02:30:34,140
healthy vegetables and all this
different shit. And now look at me.

2707
02:30:34,160 --> 02:30:37,810
90 days later I'm all healthy. You
know, you can't, it can be done.

2708
02:30:37,840 --> 02:30:39,220
It's just very difficult.

2709
02:30:39,550 --> 02:30:44,350
And it sort of flies in the face of a
lot of people like to harp on free will

2710
02:30:44,351 --> 02:30:48,220
and determinism and there is no
freewill and these sort of, you know,

2711
02:30:48,400 --> 02:30:52,120
I think those can be fascinating
philosophical debates.

2712
02:30:52,360 --> 02:30:55,450
But I think as far as like your own life,
it could be a massive distraction.

2713
02:30:55,451 --> 02:30:58,510
This idea, this concept that
there is no free will. Yeah,

2714
02:30:58,900 --> 02:31:02,170
throw that shit out the window and just
fucking get off your lazy ass and get

2715
02:31:02,171 --> 02:31:02,681
shit done.

2716
02:31:02,681 --> 02:31:07,300
Cause this cause that's
like this pontificating of
whether or not freewill is a

2717
02:31:07,301 --> 02:31:10,890
real thing. It's not going to
fucking help you. Well and for me,

2718
02:31:11,030 --> 02:31:16,010
I mean I act as if I have
free will because I know
it's going to get me a better

2719
02:31:16,011 --> 02:31:19,070
life and if I don't have freewill it was
pretty determined that I'm going to act

2720
02:31:19,080 --> 02:31:21,330
as if I have free will. So I don't
lose anything that way either way.

2721
02:31:21,331 --> 02:31:24,990
So I mean I'm just going to pretend like
I have free will maximize it as much as

2722
02:31:24,991 --> 02:31:26,730
I can.
And if it turns out I don't,

2723
02:31:26,760 --> 02:31:28,350
then I was pretty determined
to believe that anyway.

2724
02:31:28,380 --> 02:31:30,420
I said, yeah, I don't understand it.

2725
02:31:30,421 --> 02:31:34,110
I mean the argument one way or the
other that can be proven and in each,

2726
02:31:34,170 --> 02:31:36,460
well Sam Harris will be on soon.

2727
02:31:36,810 --> 02:31:39,120
I'll have a conversation
with him about it because he,

2728
02:31:39,180 --> 02:31:44,180
he can go into it from a neuroscientific
standpoint because apparently they can

2729
02:31:44,491 --> 02:31:48,180
determine that. You make decisions
before you make decisions

2730
02:31:48,580 --> 02:31:51,670
down in the Amygdala, like the base
and the brain, top of the spine.

2731
02:31:52,510 --> 02:31:54,370
That impulse is there.

2732
02:31:54,460 --> 02:31:57,970
And then people make the decision and
they experienced a decision up here.

2733
02:31:57,971 --> 02:31:59,470
But the decision is happening down here.

2734
02:31:59,740 --> 02:32:01,930
I don't think that means
that's inevitable for everyone.

2735
02:32:01,931 --> 02:32:05,350
That's part of self knowledge is learning
what your emotional triggers are so

2736
02:32:05,351 --> 02:32:09,790
that you can make decisions right
now you're not just ex post facto

2737
02:32:09,791 --> 02:32:12,580
rationalizing stuff that you want to
do anyway. You learn about yourself.

2738
02:32:12,581 --> 02:32:15,670
And I think that you can expand
free well by through self knowledge.

2739
02:32:15,671 --> 02:32:18,400
It's what Socrates said at the
very beginning of philosophy. Uh,

2740
02:32:18,401 --> 02:32:22,000
the first commandment is know thyself
and that way you can figure out your own

2741
02:32:22,001 --> 02:32:26,150
cognitive biases and you can figure out
what blocks you and what, what your um,

2742
02:32:26,380 --> 02:32:28,720
prejudices are.
And then I think you get choices.

2743
02:32:28,890 --> 02:32:30,790
But I don't think you get
choices just for having a brain.

2744
02:32:30,791 --> 02:32:31,960
You really have to explore it.

2745
02:32:32,200 --> 02:32:34,430
Like you don't know a country
just by falling into it.

2746
02:32:34,830 --> 02:32:38,050
You out of a plane land somewhere, you
have to explore it. You have to map it,

2747
02:32:38,051 --> 02:32:40,780
you have to know the terrain and
then you're competent at the country.

2748
02:32:40,781 --> 02:32:41,980
And I think that freewill is,

2749
02:32:41,981 --> 02:32:46,540
is pursued through south
knowledge and that gives you
the choice. Um, but so yeah,

2750
02:32:46,570 --> 02:32:48,670
if you think you can, you think
you can't, you're right. I mean,

2751
02:32:48,671 --> 02:32:50,690
if you think you have free will or you
think you can't, you can't have, right.

2752
02:32:51,010 --> 02:32:52,450
Yeah.
And did that impulse,

2753
02:32:52,451 --> 02:32:55,990
I would love to know if there's been any
studies done on whether or not people

2754
02:32:55,991 --> 02:32:58,810
ignore that impulse because there's a
lot of impulses that you have that you

2755
02:32:58,811 --> 02:32:59,750
never act on.
Right.

2756
02:32:59,790 --> 02:33:03,950
Do you have a quarter second
sign? Typically you have
a quarter second to the,

2757
02:33:04,080 --> 02:33:05,640
around to interrupt an impulse.

2758
02:33:06,110 --> 02:33:07,610
How much research has been done on that?

2759
02:33:07,611 --> 02:33:10,250
Like how many people were observed
and how through uh, how, uh,

2760
02:33:10,310 --> 02:33:14,690
how many different complicated periods
of their life where they've been forced

2761
02:33:14,691 --> 02:33:17,570
to have weird situation. How many people
wanted to strangle somebody and didn't,

2762
02:33:18,170 --> 02:33:19,330
you know, I mean, how many times now?

2763
02:33:19,340 --> 02:33:22,200
I think most people given how few
strangulations there aren't worth,

2764
02:33:22,220 --> 02:33:25,880
I think most people manage to, you know,
slapped down the strangle hands, you know,

2765
02:33:25,881 --> 02:33:26,714
and it's really important.

2766
02:33:26,750 --> 02:33:29,780
Wouldn't that be like the number one
argument against free will is how few

2767
02:33:29,781 --> 02:33:34,030
people get strangled. We've all
been there, we've all been there.

2768
02:33:34,300 --> 02:33:34,811
Now what about,

2769
02:33:34,811 --> 02:33:37,330
but what about the days when do you
have two days where you're just like,

2770
02:33:38,320 --> 02:33:41,500
the elephant of inertia sits on your
chest and just fucks up your nose and you

2771
02:33:41,501 --> 02:33:43,450
just don't want to get anything
done? I mean, how'd he,

2772
02:33:43,451 --> 02:33:46,180
how'd he do deal with those? I mean, you
just let them ride. I mean, how do you,

2773
02:33:46,340 --> 02:33:50,990
I don't have those days that much.
No, no. I don't know if they do,

2774
02:33:50,991 --> 02:33:55,160
I'm usually sick. Okay. It's usually
like a health thing. And if I'm sick,

2775
02:33:55,430 --> 02:33:59,120
I'm pretty good. I'm, I've gotten really
good at not doing shit when I'm sick,

2776
02:33:59,121 --> 02:34:03,750
but just drinking liquids and eating
healthy foods and relaxing and I'll go in

2777
02:34:03,751 --> 02:34:08,420
the isolation tank and meditate
and I don't, I'm a, I'm not a big,

2778
02:34:08,780 --> 02:34:11,480
I think if there's something
wrong, like I'm like, Ooh,

2779
02:34:11,690 --> 02:34:14,750
I usually don't do anything.
I just usually let everything recover.

2780
02:34:15,200 --> 02:34:18,280
Your listen to your body, but it's
basically a saying, we need some downtime,

2781
02:34:18,281 --> 02:34:19,100
we need some recharge.

2782
02:34:19,100 --> 02:34:22,880
Well, that's where my energy comes from
because my mind is usually pretty damn

2783
02:34:22,881 --> 02:34:23,510
energetic.

2784
02:34:23,510 --> 02:34:25,730
My mind is always filled with a bunch
of different things I don't try to

2785
02:34:25,731 --> 02:34:29,780
accomplish and different things that
I'm interested in pursuing. But My,

2786
02:34:30,050 --> 02:34:33,860
if I'm down, usually it's
my body. Right? You know,

2787
02:34:33,861 --> 02:34:36,590
maybe I get that.
Sometimes I've worked out too hard.

2788
02:34:36,591 --> 02:34:40,540
If I'm overtrained I get exhausted,
but it just, I just recover, you know?

2789
02:34:40,730 --> 02:34:42,770
But I don't discount peoples,

2790
02:34:42,950 --> 02:34:47,570
the mental blockades and the different
issues that some folks do have with

2791
02:34:47,571 --> 02:34:51,680
motivation and with, uh,
with depression and a that,

2792
02:34:52,400 --> 02:34:56,420
whether that depression comes from
chemical abuse, abusing substances,

2793
02:34:56,421 --> 02:34:59,120
or whether it comes from
a biological perspective.

2794
02:34:59,450 --> 02:35:04,450
Kara Santa Maria and will be on
next week on the first and uh,

2795
02:35:04,850 --> 02:35:09,410
uh, no, I mean, uh, soon. Next
week. Yeah, next Monday I think.

2796
02:35:09,840 --> 02:35:14,360
Um, and she's a neuroscientist as
well and she's had issues the 25th,

2797
02:35:14,361 --> 02:35:17,730
that's when she's coming on and she's
had issues herself with depression and

2798
02:35:17,731 --> 02:35:20,900
she's pretty open about it and she,
she understands,

2799
02:35:20,960 --> 02:35:23,930
understands it much more
from a chemical standpoint,

2800
02:35:24,320 --> 02:35:27,260
from what's going on inside the mind.
And there's a,

2801
02:35:27,261 --> 02:35:31,070
there's a lot going on there that keeps
people on that fucking couch. And, uh,

2802
02:35:32,410 --> 02:35:32,700
it's,

2803
02:35:32,700 --> 02:35:37,700
what's interesting is it doesn't exist
in all cultures and that it may be also

2804
02:35:37,731 --> 02:35:39,050
the society that we live in,

2805
02:35:39,051 --> 02:35:42,300
that this is a very unnatural way
to live your life and that the,

2806
02:35:42,301 --> 02:35:43,730
the human body's not essentially,

2807
02:35:43,731 --> 02:35:47,540
essentially not designed for sitting in
cubicles, sitting in cars, no motion.

2808
02:35:47,870 --> 02:35:52,100
And they've also shown that exercise
has been as effective at mitigating

2809
02:35:52,610 --> 02:35:57,160
depression, has have antidepressants
as an Ssri, which I think,

2810
02:35:57,170 --> 02:36:01,010
I think the physical exercise
plus therapy is, you know,

2811
02:36:01,070 --> 02:36:04,400
your best times for longterm recovery
from the data that I've read with regards

2812
02:36:04,401 --> 02:36:05,050
to depression.

2813
02:36:05,050 --> 02:36:09,370
Yeah. I think people need to get their
juices flowing. I think it's, it's so,

2814
02:36:09,880 --> 02:36:13,720
it's so underrated and um,
it's associated with vanity.

2815
02:36:13,721 --> 02:36:17,320
It's associated with all sorts
of insecurities about, you know,

2816
02:36:17,321 --> 02:36:19,810
your body that you're trying to
pump yourself up and your ego,

2817
02:36:19,811 --> 02:36:22,390
but put all that out of the
window. I mean, God damn,

2818
02:36:22,391 --> 02:36:25,540
I put a fucking a bubble outfit over your
head so you don't have to look at your

2819
02:36:25,541 --> 02:36:29,350
body if you're really tweaking on that.
It's not about that. It's about movement.

2820
02:36:29,590 --> 02:36:31,720
It's about getting all
your endorphins flowing.

2821
02:36:31,721 --> 02:36:35,080
It's about getting your body into a
natural state because the body's natural

2822
02:36:35,081 --> 02:36:36,430
state is in motion.

2823
02:36:36,850 --> 02:36:39,340
We're not supposed to be sitting
around doing nothing all day.

2824
02:36:39,341 --> 02:36:42,580
We're supposed to be hunting
and gathering. And that's
how our body was designed.

2825
02:36:42,680 --> 02:36:43,460
And do you know,
I mean,

2826
02:36:43,460 --> 02:36:46,130
we're not the strongest species and
we don't have the biggest teeth.

2827
02:36:46,131 --> 02:36:46,641
But you know,

2828
02:36:46,641 --> 02:36:50,660
one thing that human beings have is
like ridiculous physical endurance.

2829
02:36:50,840 --> 02:36:52,930
Like what I've read is
that the ancient hunters,

2830
02:36:52,940 --> 02:36:56,140
do you know how they used to
get their assistance hunting?
Yeah. You just, you, you,

2831
02:36:56,200 --> 02:37:00,680
you chase that animal until it's hard,
just fucking explodes in its chest.

2832
02:37:00,740 --> 02:37:03,410
And then you're like, I win. And
any drag it back to camp, like,

2833
02:37:03,411 --> 02:37:06,970
like 20 miles of running and then the
zebras hot just dies and you get him.

2834
02:37:07,350 --> 02:37:12,350
We're also in Africa because it's
extremely hot and they don't sweat animals

2835
02:37:12,390 --> 02:37:16,160
sweat from their tongue.
That's why a has his tongue hanging

2836
02:37:16,160 --> 02:37:18,770
out when it's hot, their body
doesn't sweat water, right?

2837
02:37:18,800 --> 02:37:22,550
So they overheat very quickly.
Right? So they're good for sprints,

2838
02:37:22,880 --> 02:37:26,660
but they're not good for long term
long endurance runs. And that's what

2839
02:37:28,160 --> 02:37:30,100
being bipeds right. I mean, um,

2840
02:37:30,430 --> 02:37:33,140
I think I read somewhere that one of
the ways that we were able to get,

2841
02:37:33,190 --> 02:37:34,970
I'm most expensive organ is the brain.
Right?

2842
02:37:35,240 --> 02:37:38,270
But one of the reasons we're able to
have the brain is because when we were on

2843
02:37:38,271 --> 02:37:41,450
all fours,
more of our back was exposed to sunlight.

2844
02:37:41,510 --> 02:37:44,420
And so we had to spend more of the
water and energy cooling ourselves off.

2845
02:37:44,421 --> 02:37:45,500
Once we went by Piddle,

2846
02:37:45,770 --> 02:37:48,770
much less sun is hitting the body so you
have more water available to grow the

2847
02:37:48,771 --> 02:37:52,100
brain. Because the brain requires a lot
of energy and water and just really cool

2848
02:37:52,101 --> 02:37:54,980
things. I love that biological
development stuff I think is really,

2849
02:37:55,190 --> 02:37:57,940
really fascinating.
Unbelievably fascinating.

2850
02:37:57,960 --> 02:38:01,960
The development of the human brain as
opposed to the brains of lower hominids is

2851
02:38:01,970 --> 02:38:03,700
one of the biggest
mysteries in all science.

2852
02:38:03,730 --> 02:38:07,250
There's so many different things have
been attributed to what caused the human

2853
02:38:07,251 --> 02:38:11,690
brain to grow double in brain size over
a period of 2 million years is pretty

2854
02:38:11,691 --> 02:38:14,240
fascinating.
But thank God it happened I guess.

2855
02:38:14,450 --> 02:38:18,770
But this conversation probably be a
lot less entertaining if a grunting and

2856
02:38:18,771 --> 02:38:21,560
pounding our head forehead into the
microphone. And not only that, if,

2857
02:38:21,610 --> 02:38:23,060
if it was the same conversation,

2858
02:38:23,061 --> 02:38:26,540
who the fuck would listen drew that they
wouldn't be able to understand? Yeah,

2859
02:38:26,541 --> 02:38:26,871
I think,

2860
02:38:26,871 --> 02:38:30,410
I think that's a huge amount of human
potential that's locked up in people's

2861
02:38:30,411 --> 02:38:34,040
insecurities and inertia.
And uh, I, I really, um,

2862
02:38:34,880 --> 02:38:39,080
uh, I really would love to find
a way and you know, to just get,

2863
02:38:39,110 --> 02:38:42,530
get people to understand how much fun
being in motion is and how much fun

2864
02:38:42,531 --> 02:38:46,670
exploring and challenging yourself and
challenging the world. How much fun it is,

2865
02:38:46,671 --> 02:38:50,150
but I think that there's just
a lot of, I dunno, negativity,

2866
02:38:50,151 --> 02:38:52,430
hostility of course on the Internet
as we were talking about earlier,

2867
02:38:52,431 --> 02:38:54,140
it's kind of not all over the place,

2868
02:38:54,141 --> 02:38:58,790
but it's definitely there and I just wish
people could understand that there is

2869
02:38:58,791 --> 02:39:01,970
very little to be afraid of in life.
I mean other than death,

2870
02:39:01,971 --> 02:39:04,940
which is going to happen whether
you're busy or not. What's interesting,

2871
02:39:04,941 --> 02:39:09,230
we're were talking about essentially
like if we could talk to Robin Williams,

2872
02:39:09,231 --> 02:39:12,950
if we could pull Robin Williams aside
before he committed suicide and have these

2873
02:39:12,951 --> 02:39:17,090
conversations with them. If you
look at that guy, he is in a way,

2874
02:39:17,360 --> 02:39:20,060
a great example of someone who

2875
02:39:20,470 --> 02:39:23,530
paper should be unbelievably happy.

2876
02:39:23,531 --> 02:39:26,230
He's been insanely successful.

2877
02:39:26,231 --> 02:39:29,920
He is loved by millions
and yet still not happy.

2878
02:39:30,220 --> 02:39:35,220
And one of the reasons is you look at
his life and it's this series of things

2879
02:39:36,461 --> 02:39:37,480
that went wrong,

2880
02:39:37,481 --> 02:39:42,481
series of coke binges and alcoholism and
breakups of the marriage and regret for

2881
02:39:43,541 --> 02:39:46,510
the way he was raised by his parents
and all these different things that you

2882
02:39:46,511 --> 02:39:50,920
carry around with you like weight. And
it's very difficult to shed that weight.

2883
02:39:51,190 --> 02:39:53,380
I don't know what he
did besides counseling.

2884
02:39:53,381 --> 02:39:58,381
I Dunno if he was an exercise guy or if
he did yoga or what his diet was like.

2885
02:39:59,231 --> 02:40:04,231
But there's a lot of people out there
that are dragged down by their past that

2886
02:40:07,150 --> 02:40:10,600
right now their heart's beating,
their breathing out of their mouth,

2887
02:40:10,780 --> 02:40:14,550
their fucking brain is functioning,
but they're just burdened.

2888
02:40:14,610 --> 02:40:16,260
They're burdened by their past.

2889
02:40:16,290 --> 02:40:19,680
And it's a huge issue with folks
like getting a fresh start,

2890
02:40:20,100 --> 02:40:23,160
like getting a reset,
getting this, you know, this,

2891
02:40:23,220 --> 02:40:26,820
this escaping all the bullshit
of their past. It's very,

2892
02:40:26,821 --> 02:40:28,110
very hard for folks to do.

2893
02:40:29,250 --> 02:40:34,130
When I was a twine to
yeah, to went back 20, uh,

2894
02:40:34,140 --> 02:40:36,750
I was at the national theater school
studying acting and playwriting,

2895
02:40:37,140 --> 02:40:42,140
and I was in a play King Lear and we
had this delightfully insane director,

2896
02:40:43,570 --> 02:40:48,450
uh, who was, and, and that, so something
bad happen on stage in the play.

2897
02:40:48,960 --> 02:40:51,310
And, uh, we were all
method actress, you know,

2898
02:40:51,311 --> 02:40:55,260
I grew up on Brando and stuff like that.
So it was all internal and we were just,

2899
02:40:55,270 --> 02:40:59,340
uh, and so he said basically he stopped
the rehearsal when this thing happened in

2900
02:40:59,341 --> 02:41:03,630
the play and he said,
why isn't anyone reacting?

2901
02:41:04,830 --> 02:41:09,780
And we said, we all said Paul, but I felt
it inside. And he's like, this is theater,

2902
02:41:10,170 --> 02:41:13,470
right? Nobody has a window into your
head. You've got to do something.

2903
02:41:13,980 --> 02:41:17,130
And he got himself when he actually
ended up throwing chairs, he's like,

2904
02:41:17,131 --> 02:41:21,900
just do something to anything.
I don't care. Do a somersault.

2905
02:41:22,080 --> 02:41:25,410
Produce a dove from inside your cloak.
I bet do something.

2906
02:41:25,411 --> 02:41:28,050
So the audience knows that
something is happening.

2907
02:41:28,410 --> 02:41:30,930
Don't just stand there and
expect them to be mind readers.

2908
02:41:30,931 --> 02:41:35,310
And I think that that had a big impact
on me just in terms of life as a whole.

2909
02:41:35,340 --> 02:41:37,260
You have to be out there doing stuff.
I mean,

2910
02:41:37,270 --> 02:41:40,800
the what goes on in our heads is great,
but if it's not out there in the world,

2911
02:41:40,801 --> 02:41:44,100
we'll take it with us when we die and
nobody will ever know anything about it.

2912
02:41:44,400 --> 02:41:44,871
And a,

2913
02:41:44,871 --> 02:41:48,240
I just never really wanted to have a life
where I could sort of go through life

2914
02:41:48,241 --> 02:41:52,470
and into death like a spear into a still
like, you know, barely leaving a ripple.

2915
02:41:52,890 --> 02:41:54,360
Uh,
and I think that um,

2916
02:41:54,570 --> 02:41:58,050
the challenges of an active and
challenging life where you're, you know,

2917
02:41:58,860 --> 02:42:02,970
messing with society's perceptions and
trying to advance the moral course that

2918
02:42:02,971 --> 02:42:06,330
you are passionate about is so worth it.

2919
02:42:06,360 --> 02:42:09,480
I wish people could just live one
day on the other side of that fear.

2920
02:42:09,481 --> 02:42:13,320
I wish that people could live one day
in motion and then they would never be

2921
02:42:13,321 --> 02:42:16,710
satisfied with the inertia of their lives.
But until you get there,

2922
02:42:16,711 --> 02:42:18,930
I think it's really half the
really tough for people to,

2923
02:42:19,590 --> 02:42:22,410
to picture what it's like. I mean, you
know, we were talking before the show.

2924
02:42:22,411 --> 02:42:25,680
I mean you've, you've got a special
coming up. I mean you're doing this, you,

2925
02:42:25,681 --> 02:42:28,020
I mean you, you, your ferociously busy.

2926
02:42:28,560 --> 02:42:32,460
And I think if people who are in Nerc
could live a day in your shoes and

2927
02:42:32,461 --> 02:42:37,080
recognize just how much fun it is and
what a great challenge it is and how

2928
02:42:37,920 --> 02:42:41,920
wonderful it is to be testing yourself
on the edges of your capacities. A,

2929
02:42:41,921 --> 02:42:45,270
a suit for significant periods of time.
I think that they would go back and say,

2930
02:42:45,420 --> 02:42:48,300
oh, can't do this anymore. But I
think until you've experienced it,

2931
02:42:48,301 --> 02:42:50,160
that's the tough thing
until you've experienced it.

2932
02:42:50,550 --> 02:42:53,760
I think the inertia feels safer and
better, if that makes any sense.

2933
02:42:54,100 --> 02:42:57,280
Also important to surround yourself with
other people that are also trying to

2934
02:42:57,281 --> 02:43:01,250
accomplish things. When you surround
yourself with lazy people, it's it,

2935
02:43:01,320 --> 02:43:04,930
it's very taxing. And you surround
yourself that self sabotaging people.

2936
02:43:04,960 --> 02:43:07,120
They kind of cocked buck your
ambitions a little bit too, right?

2937
02:43:07,121 --> 02:43:08,890
Cause they're like, oh, I don't
know if that'll be a good idea.

2938
02:43:08,891 --> 02:43:11,770
I don't know if that'll work.
I don't know. Yeah, well

2939
02:43:12,030 --> 02:43:15,500
I lost my spinal fluid. I can't
feel my legs this. So there's a

2940
02:43:15,570 --> 02:43:17,100
negative aspect of them being around,

2941
02:43:17,101 --> 02:43:20,940
but there's certainly not the positive
aspect of being around ambitious people.

2942
02:43:21,120 --> 02:43:24,600
If you're around happy,
fun people that are full of energy,

2943
02:43:24,630 --> 02:43:27,990
you feel happy and fun and
you're full of energy as well.

2944
02:43:28,350 --> 02:43:32,250
With standup Comedians as a really
important factor. Like we, we,

2945
02:43:32,251 --> 02:43:36,870
we grow the best, we grow the most
when we're around others like us,

2946
02:43:36,871 --> 02:43:41,430
like the best comedy communities.
It's not one comic that stands out,

2947
02:43:41,610 --> 02:43:42,600
you know,
there's not,

2948
02:43:42,870 --> 02:43:47,870
like I started out in Boston and there
was like 10 12 great comics where I was

2949
02:43:49,320 --> 02:43:52,680
and one of the things about that place
as you would see all these great comics

2950
02:43:52,681 --> 02:43:57,090
and they went inspire you and there's
other towns where there are no great

2951
02:43:57,091 --> 02:44:01,140
comics and there's no great comics coming
up and you'll see like the local guys

2952
02:44:01,141 --> 02:44:02,190
and their dog shit,

2953
02:44:02,191 --> 02:44:06,000
their acts are terrible and the reason
why is they have no one to emulate.

2954
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:10,320
There's no one around to build them up.
There's no community and standup comedy.

2955
02:44:10,321 --> 02:44:12,180
It's very important to have a community.

2956
02:44:12,181 --> 02:44:17,181
I did all my growing as a comic in the
communities of Boston than New York and

2957
02:44:17,761 --> 02:44:18,451
then La,

2958
02:44:18,451 --> 02:44:23,310
the two to three rather strongest
communities in the country.

2959
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:26,430
Boston not so much anymore,
but at the time huge.

2960
02:44:26,640 --> 02:44:31,640
And now New York is still just as giant
and La is giant and those being in those

2961
02:44:32,161 --> 02:44:34,710
clubs and being around
those guys and seeing those,

2962
02:44:34,920 --> 02:44:38,000
those other people that are out
there writing new jokes and,

2963
02:44:38,001 --> 02:44:43,001
and constantly expanding and creating
and growing and getting better at the art

2964
02:44:43,471 --> 02:44:46,260
form inspires people and that's um,

2965
02:44:46,740 --> 02:44:48,720
that cannot be underestimated.

2966
02:44:48,721 --> 02:44:51,900
Surround yourself with positive
people and you will be positive.

2967
02:44:51,901 --> 02:44:55,170
Surround yourself with shit heads and
you'll be a shithead or at least you'll be

2968
02:44:55,171 --> 02:44:56,640
fighting against being a shithead.

2969
02:44:56,840 --> 02:44:57,081
Yeah.

2970
02:44:57,081 --> 02:45:00,140
I mean nobody expects to become a great
tennis player if they pay light people

2971
02:45:00,141 --> 02:45:03,350
who can't play. Yeah, I mean you, you
have to match yourself against the best.

2972
02:45:03,351 --> 02:45:05,630
And this is another thing,
last random promise of the day,

2973
02:45:05,631 --> 02:45:10,040
but the people who have low
expectations and low ambitions,

2974
02:45:10,200 --> 02:45:14,690
I also find a little frustrating at times.
I mean,

2975
02:45:15,170 --> 02:45:18,130
I think aim, aim your sights as high
as humanly possible. I mean there's,

2976
02:45:18,160 --> 02:45:21,650
there's no Schwartz and egger films unless
that crazy bastard from Austria comes

2977
02:45:21,651 --> 02:45:24,680
and says, I didn't barely
speak the language, but I'm
going to go marry a Kennedy,

2978
02:45:24,681 --> 02:45:28,850
Ran California and make some great movies.
We don't forget it. Fuck my main, well,

2979
02:45:28,851 --> 02:45:31,120
there's that aspect to have that aspect.
It,

2980
02:45:31,121 --> 02:45:33,220
that's the problem with hyper ambition.

2981
02:45:33,260 --> 02:45:37,000
It manifests itself and sometimes an
unfortunate and uncomfortable to literally

2982
02:45:37,280 --> 02:45:41,840
check the Alpha. But, um, uh, but
the people who, I mean, again,

2983
02:45:41,841 --> 02:45:43,370
I sort of feel like, um, you know,

2984
02:45:43,371 --> 02:45:48,050
I was sick last year and
confronting mortality and
all that and it's sort of how

2985
02:45:48,051 --> 02:45:51,950
I've lived as a whole is
whether you're great or not,

2986
02:45:51,951 --> 02:45:55,760
whether your ambitions are high or low,
death's going to take you either way. And,

2987
02:45:55,780 --> 02:45:56,090
uh,

2988
02:45:56,090 --> 02:46:01,090
I think that it adds to the human capital
of the world to strive to communicate,

2989
02:46:01,970 --> 02:46:06,200
passion, power, magic, creativity, virtue,
whatever it is that you're good at,

2990
02:46:06,620 --> 02:46:08,180
it adds to the human capital of the world.

2991
02:46:08,181 --> 02:46:11,450
We all inherit this stuff that comes
rolling down the mountain of history from

2992
02:46:11,451 --> 02:46:14,060
all the great people who've
come before us add a little bit.

2993
02:46:14,061 --> 02:46:18,320
Anything that you can do that human
momentum of, of energy and positivity.

2994
02:46:18,321 --> 02:46:23,300
I think that's so important. And the
people who want to do a little or get by.

2995
02:46:23,720 --> 02:46:25,060
I just wish I,

2996
02:46:25,310 --> 02:46:28,040
it's the biggest regret that people have
when their oldest that they played at

2997
02:46:28,041 --> 02:46:31,260
small and they didn't take the risks
that they wanted to because there's this

2998
02:46:31,270 --> 02:46:35,880
disaster on the other side of risk that
never seems to materialize. And um,

2999
02:46:36,500 --> 02:46:40,760
really it's like you're in some fight to
the battle with your own hand puppets,

3000
02:46:40,761 --> 02:46:42,920
you know, a fight to the death
with your own hand puppets.

3001
02:46:42,920 --> 02:46:46,260
I think that people just take those
gloves off and go and take life and,

3002
02:46:46,261 --> 02:46:49,700
and have high ambitions and forget
everybody who ridicules you for high

3003
02:46:49,701 --> 02:46:52,310
ambitions and great things.
Uh, they don't matter.

3004
02:46:52,460 --> 02:46:55,940
And that's a great speech that Robin
Williams has. I forget them. Forget them.

3005
02:46:55,941 --> 02:46:58,380
He says to the man who's talking
about the sweaty tooth madmen,

3006
02:46:58,400 --> 02:47:02,330
the boy who's got the poetic imagination,
he said, forget them. Forget them.

3007
02:47:02,331 --> 02:47:06,560
Focus on, on your creativity and what
is making you great. And I would really,

3008
02:47:06,561 --> 02:47:11,450
I think the human potential is the great
untapped resource of the planet. And uh,

3009
02:47:11,480 --> 02:47:13,240
I wish that there was ways to communicate.

3010
02:47:13,250 --> 02:47:15,590
I tried to do this of
course as best I can,

3011
02:47:15,591 --> 02:47:19,730
but ways to communicate to people
just how amazing a life can be,

3012
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:23,900
which is a, an active, enthusiastic,
passionate and challenging.

3013
02:47:24,530 --> 02:47:27,980
And, um, we get this
incredibly brief opportunity.

3014
02:47:27,980 --> 02:47:29,630
And I said recently in a podcast,
uh,

3015
02:47:30,140 --> 02:47:33,620
the universe has repulsively fucked
itself senseless to give you life. I mean,

3016
02:47:33,830 --> 02:47:35,060
in order for us to be here,

3017
02:47:35,660 --> 02:47:39,230
like one single celled organisms
had to meet with each other. I mean,

3018
02:47:39,231 --> 02:47:41,120
that's gross.
I don't even know where they put white,

3019
02:47:41,121 --> 02:47:44,240
but it's really disgusting stuff that
goes on in a magnifying glass that's like

3020
02:47:44,241 --> 02:47:45,260
the worst porn ever.

3021
02:47:45,620 --> 02:47:49,010
But we're all here because
of this incredible striving
for billions of years of

3022
02:47:49,011 --> 02:47:54,011
this life and to not embrace
that gift of existence.

3023
02:47:54,381 --> 02:47:55,640
In this brief time that we have.

3024
02:47:55,641 --> 02:48:00,380
It just seems to me such a waste and such
a disrespect to the incredible odds of

3025
02:48:00,381 --> 02:48:04,130
us actually being here and being in this
relatively free country and being in

3026
02:48:04,131 --> 02:48:07,730
this incredible time of communication,
technology and human opportunity.

3027
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:11,210
I really want people to try and
grab that as much as possible. Uh,

3028
02:48:11,270 --> 02:48:15,290
you do not save up points that you get to
redeem after your dad spend everything,

3029
02:48:15,291 --> 02:48:19,160
leave nothing on the table. And that's
what I hope people can find a way to do.

3030
02:48:19,340 --> 02:48:21,010
But I think by living your life,
I liked

3031
02:48:21,030 --> 02:48:23,720
that you set an example that
people can be inspired by.

3032
02:48:23,721 --> 02:48:27,080
And I think that having
these conversations and
and having something that

3033
02:48:27,081 --> 02:48:30,170
someone can listen to when they, they,
they hear this and they go, you know what?

3034
02:48:30,171 --> 02:48:33,080
I'm going to go fucking run up a hill.
I'm going to go do something.

3035
02:48:33,081 --> 02:48:34,430
And people do do that.

3036
02:48:34,431 --> 02:48:37,750
I get messages from people that
do hear these conversations at an,

3037
02:48:37,780 --> 02:48:39,020
it enhances their life.

3038
02:48:39,021 --> 02:48:42,350
And I've had so many people come up
to me after the show and say that the

3039
02:48:42,351 --> 02:48:45,650
podcast changed their life because they
become motivated because they never had

3040
02:48:45,651 --> 02:48:48,440
anybody around them that
was inspiring in any way.

3041
02:48:48,441 --> 02:48:51,410
And then all of a sudden they get to
hear conversations with inspirational

3042
02:48:51,411 --> 02:48:56,090
people and they take these conversations
and it fuels them it. And we need that.

3043
02:48:56,120 --> 02:48:58,640
You know, if you can't have that
community in your neighborhood, you can,

3044
02:48:58,850 --> 02:49:00,530
you can have that community online now.

3045
02:49:00,770 --> 02:49:04,010
You can have that community by having
access to these kinds of conversations,

3046
02:49:04,011 --> 02:49:08,970
by listening to songs that fire you up
by a book that gets you going by hearing

3047
02:49:08,971 --> 02:49:11,550
a conversation by there's,
there's many, many,

3048
02:49:11,551 --> 02:49:16,320
many methods and it's all about just
having the access to these influences by

3049
02:49:16,321 --> 02:49:19,830
having the access to these positive
things. And you can enhance your life.

3050
02:49:20,730 --> 02:49:24,240
What one man can do and what one woman
can do another man and woman can do.

3051
02:49:24,300 --> 02:49:28,770
And yeah, nobody needs to be denied a
great life, but you will not come to you.

3052
02:49:28,771 --> 02:49:31,830
You have to at least go and meet
it halfway. And I hope that people,

3053
02:49:31,831 --> 02:49:35,820
I know that your show gets a lot of
people roused and gets a lot of people

3054
02:49:35,821 --> 02:49:38,490
energetic. And that I hugely
applaud you for, I think it's a,

3055
02:49:38,491 --> 02:49:42,810
it's a fantastic contribution to the
world to be able to inspire people

3056
02:49:42,811 --> 02:49:46,140
certainly in your comedy. I mean,
which is fantastic. I mean, by the way,

3057
02:49:46,170 --> 02:49:48,350
if you haven't seen Joe,
go see Joe. But, uh,

3058
02:49:48,360 --> 02:49:51,240
I think that that energy is
incredibly positive and uh,

3059
02:49:51,310 --> 02:49:54,210
I think people who grew up around
negative people are neutral people.

3060
02:49:54,211 --> 02:49:57,750
They don't even know what it's like to
have any kind of incandescence around

3061
02:49:57,751 --> 02:49:58,830
them.
And if they see that,

3062
02:49:59,040 --> 02:50:03,930
then it awakens in them a possibility
that probably was not possible even within

3063
02:50:03,931 --> 02:50:07,710
their own imaginations before.
And I think that social media and

3064
02:50:09,360 --> 02:50:10,560
the Internet and Youtube,

3065
02:50:10,561 --> 02:50:14,070
it's giving people access to conversations
that they probably have been sealed

3066
02:50:14,071 --> 02:50:19,071
off from a it for who knows how many
generations in sectors of society have not

3067
02:50:19,621 --> 02:50:24,210
had access to enthusiasm, positivity,
competence, efficiency, energy.

3068
02:50:24,450 --> 02:50:28,350
And now there's this amazing
cross pollination of an energetic,

3069
02:50:28,351 --> 02:50:29,490
enthusiastic people.

3070
02:50:29,491 --> 02:50:32,940
We can pollinate people who otherwise
would never have had access to it.

3071
02:50:32,941 --> 02:50:35,050
I think what an amazing
opportunity that is for a,

3072
02:50:35,051 --> 02:50:36,840
for a to unleash more human potential.

3073
02:50:36,870 --> 02:50:39,690
Yeah. We live in awesome times. And, uh,

3074
02:50:39,710 --> 02:50:42,900
I want to thank you for addressing all
the criticisms and all the different

3075
02:50:42,901 --> 02:50:43,800
things that I,

3076
02:50:43,801 --> 02:50:47,280
I've been fielding and I think we
really illuminated a lot of these. Uh,

3077
02:50:47,330 --> 02:50:51,270
I appreciate the opportunities and,
uh, if someone wants to follow you,

3078
02:50:51,271 --> 02:50:56,070
it's Stefan Molyneux on Twitter.
Can you spell that out for folks?

3079
02:50:56,300 --> 02:51:00,460
Uh, can I give the secret handshake
cling on to enter the Celt compound?

3080
02:51:00,760 --> 02:51:03,370
That's most important to me.
So they can go to free domain radio.

3081
02:51:03,460 --> 02:51:06,880
They can youtube.com/free domain radio.
Um,

3082
02:51:06,970 --> 02:51:10,210
Twitter is stiff and a free
domain radio and um, yeah,

3083
02:51:10,330 --> 02:51:12,580
and Stefan Molyneux,
the spelling is,

3084
02:51:12,610 --> 02:51:17,610
it's an f s t e f a n m o l y n.

3085
02:51:17,920 --> 02:51:22,870
E. U. X. Amen to that. You,
that's right. That's it.

3086
02:51:22,900 --> 02:51:26,350
All right, well thank you very much man.
