1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,090
Hello Freak pitches.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:04,350
You know,

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:09,350
one of my heroes who's building a health
city in the Cayman Islands is named a

4
00:00:10,271 --> 00:00:11,140
Devy shitty.

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:12,300
Uh,

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,140
he did create name.

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:13,591
Yeah.

8
00:00:13,591 --> 00:00:13,891
He's a,

9
00:00:13,891 --> 00:00:17,070
he's an Indian guy and he
did amazing stuff with,

10
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:17,671
you know,

11
00:00:17,671 --> 00:00:18,700
he'll offer Americans,

12
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:19,290
uh,

13
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:23,130
heart surgery for one 10th the price
with the best doctors and that makes them

14
00:00:23,131 --> 00:00:26,490
enough money where he can offer a
medical insurance to rural Indians,

15
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:27,510
uh,

16
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:28,800
for 25 cents a month.

17
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,860
So he plays this kind of
jurisdictional arbitrage.

18
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:33,450
So now he's moving,

19
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:33,691
uh,

20
00:00:33,691 --> 00:00:38,610
to the Cayman Islands and building what
are called health cities ready to catch

21
00:00:38,611 --> 00:00:39,444
the wiving,

22
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:43,380
the rising wave of Americans who are
going to be dissatisfied with their

23
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,090
healthcare and when a faster,

24
00:00:45,091 --> 00:00:45,990
quicker and cheaper.

25
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,310
And we'll fly there.

26
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:48,773
And I,

27
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,380
I've been looking at him as a guy
that seems like he understands what

28
00:00:52,381 --> 00:00:53,191
seasteading would be.

29
00:00:53,191 --> 00:00:57,090
He seems to understand the principles
and he's applying them by using real

30
00:00:57,091 --> 00:00:57,924
islands.

31
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:01,480
And I've always fantasized if I could
talk to him and get him to like invest in

32
00:01:01,481 --> 00:01:02,314
the cease dead.

33
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:03,121
And you know,

34
00:01:03,121 --> 00:01:07,260
I almost peed my pants a few months ago
where he was in the news and he said,

35
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:07,861
you know,

36
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:11,220
the best place to have a floating
hospital would be on a ship,

37
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:11,850
you know,

38
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,980
off the coast of a major American city.

39
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,260
Given that we don't have that,

40
00:01:16,261 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm going to build one
in the Cayman Islands.

41
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:18,601
And I'm like,

42
00:01:18,601 --> 00:01:19,290
oh my God,

43
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,860
there's so many people
thinking along these lines.

44
00:01:22,861 --> 00:01:23,820
Like if we could just,

45
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,410
we have innovations and technologies
moving forward and we have regulatory

46
00:01:28,411 --> 00:01:32,490
structures and government's holding it
back and the world can't be held back.

47
00:01:32,491 --> 00:01:36,180
The world has to move forward when you
don't want to overthrow governments

48
00:01:36,181 --> 00:01:37,014
that's violent.

49
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,200
You want to innovate and compete with
an embarrassed governments the way you

50
00:01:42,571 --> 00:01:46,050
know Singapore and Hong Kong
and the island man have done.

51
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:46,710
Heck,

52
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:47,471
she was like that too.

53
00:01:47,471 --> 00:01:49,270
I worked with him in Texas.

54
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:50,950
I mean this is,

55
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,450
I was getting high,

56
00:01:52,451 --> 00:01:55,000
so 29 years ago,

57
00:01:55,001 --> 00:01:55,834
30 you know,

58
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,440
wow.

59
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:01,440
And kiss something happened to him in
seven 11 and he went on stage and adlibbed

60
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,030
about it to next night for tea.

61
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,913
And I'm going,

62
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,970
I'll never be that funny
as long as I fucking live.

63
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,150
I'll never be that for,

64
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,190
why am I doing this?

65
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:12,040
We were at catch a rising
star in New York one night.

66
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:17,080
So Brenner goes on and this is,

67
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,990
I mean they love Brenner was
fucking bread or at the time.

68
00:02:19,991 --> 00:02:20,650
Yeah,

69
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,480
cause he was a big act back then.

70
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:23,950
Big fucking act.

71
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,400
So ladies and John Deere Brenner
kills the fucking audience.

72
00:02:27,401 --> 00:02:28,150
Goes nuts.

73
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,983
Okay.

74
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,250
So does he set there one
and Hicks goes on after him.

75
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,020
Hicks opens up with,

76
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:35,891
you know,

77
00:02:35,891 --> 00:02:40,891
I was growing up and I used
to watch comedy on TV and
I'd watch Robert Klein and

78
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:42,670
David Brenner.

79
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,510
I'm thinking if these
fucking guys can do with,

80
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,353
so can I,

81
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,010
that's his opening fucking joke.

82
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,300
Then he goes into that Nancy Reagan,

83
00:02:50,301 --> 00:02:51,900
that anorexic Qantas Hall.

84
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:55,420
So people are running out
like there was a fire.

85
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,720
I mean he just fucking cunt and mean
it's comics and he gets off stage.

86
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,691
I swear to God,

87
00:03:01,691 --> 00:03:02,231
he walked up to me,

88
00:03:02,231 --> 00:03:02,680
he goes,

89
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,760
fuck what happened?

90
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,140
What went wrong?

91
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:05,621
Oh,

92
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:06,370
I don't know.

93
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,400
Maybe the anorexic conti trashing the guy,

94
00:03:10,401 --> 00:03:15,401
that date is fucking loved
and he was so fucking dark,

95
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,660
just dark,

96
00:03:16,661 --> 00:03:17,140
just Wah.

97
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:17,850
You know what I mean?

98
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:20,070
It's just like if you listen to now,

99
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,561
you're going to have,

100
00:03:20,561 --> 00:03:21,131
that's all right.

101
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:24,160
But this is fucking 30 years ago,

102
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,720
this is 30 years ago,

103
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:27,370
this shit was fucking dark.

104
00:03:27,371 --> 00:03:27,970
You know,

105
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,130
Jenny will take a bit,

106
00:03:30,131 --> 00:03:31,750
he would take a premise like you say,

107
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,920
and you know,

108
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:33,410
it could,

109
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:35,470
he could turn it into 20 fucking minutes.

110
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,600
He would bring shit out of like,

111
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:37,790
well,

112
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:41,320
how the fuck did he come up with
that added that you're going,

113
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:42,070
what?

114
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,903
You know what I mean?

115
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,913
Uh,

116
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,330
but Hicks was so fucking dark and he just,

117
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,203
it,

118
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:48,011
we,

119
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:49,360
we're in fucking Texas.

120
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,011
This is true story.

121
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:51,700
So he,

122
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,320
his girlfriend just broke up with him.

123
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,210
He was going out with her forever.

124
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:59,650
So we're in a cab and he
said to the cab driver,

125
00:03:59,651 --> 00:04:01,350
I want to hooker in tech.

126
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,130
And we were in Lubbock in Lubbock.

127
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,421
It's a true story.

128
00:04:04,421 --> 00:04:05,290
So the old man,

129
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,990
so I made me shivers
just thinking about it.

130
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:09,930
So,

131
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:10,930
so the cab driver's said,

132
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:11,111
okay,

133
00:04:11,111 --> 00:04:14,260
I'll take you to one plate
on and you go to their house.

134
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,780
So I was just going to
wait in the cab like so.

135
00:04:16,781 --> 00:04:21,781
He wants to the first house and the
lady opened the door and looked at him,

136
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:22,853
goes to a cops,

137
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,693
slammed the door,

138
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,130
excuse back into car

139
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:28,483
[inaudible]

140
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,450
but then it makes no sense,

141
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:32,471
don't Kevin,

142
00:04:32,471 --> 00:04:34,060
I would take him to another place.

143
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,500
She opens the door and goes,

144
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:36,281
you're too young.

145
00:04:36,281 --> 00:04:37,120
Slams the door,

146
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:38,531
gets in the car.

147
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:38,920
He goes,

148
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:43,630
I can't get fucking hookers
me 10 minutes the next night.

149
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,810
Just brilliant fucking on hookers.

150
00:04:46,811 --> 00:04:47,644
That won't fuck up

151
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,660
in local taxes.

152
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,330
Just fucking brilliant.

153
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,260
I'm going.

154
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,390
It's unbelievable how
fucking good this guy is.

155
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,433
The

156
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:02,320
the amount of responsibility involved
in influencing a young developing mind

157
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:06,830
can't be under overestimated due.

158
00:05:06,831 --> 00:05:08,720
You have to overcome for
remember when you were a kid?

159
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:08,970
Yeah,

160
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:09,920
I do like good ones.

161
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,490
Like late,

162
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,010
like the sun in the sky.

163
00:05:13,011 --> 00:05:14,420
You can see any kind of see any star.

164
00:05:14,421 --> 00:05:17,360
I can't see the other teachers in my
head for the few good ones that I had.

165
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:17,660
Yeah.

166
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,360
What an incredibly,

167
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,160
they could all be like,

168
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,971
obviously it'd be great,

169
00:05:19,971 --> 00:05:21,020
but I mean teach us.

170
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:21,290
Yeah.

171
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:22,310
Awesome responsibility.

172
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:22,641
Yeah.

173
00:05:22,641 --> 00:05:23,810
I had some great ones.

174
00:05:23,811 --> 00:05:27,710
I had a few great ones that were just
really good people that were smart and

175
00:05:27,711 --> 00:05:29,300
kind and they,

176
00:05:29,301 --> 00:05:29,641
they,

177
00:05:29,641 --> 00:05:30,640
they profoundly,

178
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:34,010
I had a science teacher in seventh
grade that I had a discussion with him,

179
00:05:34,011 --> 00:05:35,660
just me and him one day
and I never forgot it.

180
00:05:35,661 --> 00:05:38,750
And we were talking about space and
he was a really interesting guy.

181
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,411
You know,

182
00:05:39,411 --> 00:05:41,600
it was a bad neighborhood we lived in,

183
00:05:41,601 --> 00:05:42,830
I lived in Jamaica plain,

184
00:05:42,831 --> 00:05:43,940
which was like this um,

185
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:48,390
neighborhood in Boston just outside of um,

186
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:49,310
uh,

187
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:49,791
Boston.

188
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:52,010
It's just is a real shit
neighborhood at the time.

189
00:05:52,011 --> 00:05:53,660
It's become a little bit gentrified now,

190
00:05:53,661 --> 00:05:55,490
but back then it was just really sketchy,

191
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,930
very poor kids.

192
00:05:56,931 --> 00:05:58,310
And was a kid that was in my class.

193
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:02,000
I guess I was seventh grade eight went
ninth is a highschool is eighth grade

194
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,360
cause it was right before high school
and this kid was 17 years old and the

195
00:06:05,361 --> 00:06:06,290
fucking eighth grade.

196
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,101
I mean,

197
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:08,370
it was crazy cause they were just,

198
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:10,760
there would be there for the beginning
of the year and then they would drop out.

199
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,770
And uh,

200
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,160
this science teacher was,

201
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:13,851
you know,

202
00:06:13,851 --> 00:06:15,620
in this shit school system,

203
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,590
but he was just genuinely kind,

204
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,240
curious patient man.

205
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,040
And he talked to me about space and,

206
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:26,540
and I'd never considered the
idea that space is never ending.

207
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,040
And he was explaining the concept of
infinity to me and that there truly is no

208
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:31,551
boundary.

209
00:06:31,551 --> 00:06:32,410
And if you really any,

210
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,021
I remember he said,

211
00:06:33,021 --> 00:06:34,790
do you ever really want
to make your head hurt?

212
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:40,070
Just stare at the sky and try to wrap
your head around the idea that it never

213
00:06:40,071 --> 00:06:40,700
ends.

214
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,150
And we had this long conversation about
it and Nick Inbetween classes one day,

215
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,471
not even a long,

216
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:45,650
you know,

217
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:46,483
10 minutes maybe,

218
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,670
but enough that I,

219
00:06:47,671 --> 00:06:50,210
I thought about that
for years to this day.

220
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:51,044
I remember that guy.

221
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,543
That's a great,

222
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,590
Richard Fiman was this a physicist?

223
00:06:54,591 --> 00:06:55,490
A fantastic guy.

224
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:56,870
And uh,

225
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:57,291
he said,

226
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,490
told about his father that his,

227
00:06:58,491 --> 00:06:58,701
you know,

228
00:06:58,701 --> 00:07:01,420
he was pulling some wagon and
he had balls in the wagon.

229
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:01,671
He said,

230
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:01,851
you know,

231
00:07:01,851 --> 00:07:02,750
it's when you pull the wagon,

232
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:03,860
the ball stay for a bit,

233
00:07:03,861 --> 00:07:05,670
and then they bump up and
then you stop the wagon.

234
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,261
They keep going.

235
00:07:06,261 --> 00:07:08,330
So he was talking about momentum
and physics and all that.

236
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,430
And so like all kids,

237
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:10,761
he said,

238
00:07:10,761 --> 00:07:10,881
well,

239
00:07:10,881 --> 00:07:11,091
why,

240
00:07:11,091 --> 00:07:11,331
why,

241
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:11,691
why?

242
00:07:11,691 --> 00:07:15,380
And then he got to a point
with his father where he said,

243
00:07:15,381 --> 00:07:15,501
well,

244
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:16,100
why?

245
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,440
And his father said that nobody knows.

246
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,371
Like,

247
00:07:19,371 --> 00:07:20,540
why is there gravity?

248
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:21,920
I mean that nobody knows.

249
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:22,370
Yeah.

250
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,010
And uh,

251
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:27,080
I think those kinds of questions
where you really stimulate your mind,

252
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,640
I think is a great idea.

253
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,790
I was telling my daughter a couple of,

254
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,030
I made me two months ago about a,

255
00:07:33,031 --> 00:07:34,550
there's an old Spanish proverb that says,

256
00:07:34,551 --> 00:07:34,850
Whoa,

257
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:35,360
um,

258
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,360
habits begin as cobwebs and end up
has chains way easier to break in the

259
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:40,920
beginning than later off.

260
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,151
Right.

261
00:07:41,151 --> 00:07:41,821
Way To put it.

262
00:07:41,821 --> 00:07:42,710
It's a great way to put it.

263
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:43,400
Wow.

264
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:43,880
And,

265
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,713
uh,

266
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,260
anyway,

267
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:45,950
she just,

268
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:46,940
she just brought this up,

269
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:47,160
uh,

270
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,571
you know,

271
00:07:47,571 --> 00:07:48,230
um,

272
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,150
that we were talking about
someone she knew and,

273
00:07:50,151 --> 00:07:52,100
and something that she
didn't like that they did.

274
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:52,971
And she said,

275
00:07:52,971 --> 00:07:53,151
yeah,

276
00:07:53,151 --> 00:07:54,980
but that's still pretty
much in the cob web phase,

277
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,230
so they can probably
still change it at him.

278
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:57,651
She's like,

279
00:07:57,651 --> 00:07:57,830
well,

280
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,431
I even,

281
00:07:58,431 --> 00:07:58,980
I didn't remember.

282
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:59,330
She's like,

283
00:07:59,330 --> 00:07:59,571
Oh yeah,

284
00:07:59,571 --> 00:08:00,770
the cob webs and change things.

285
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:04,640
Like she really sunk in her and she's
like five and she can remember those

286
00:08:04,641 --> 00:08:07,700
things that can really take you
through life and give you real clarity.

287
00:08:07,701 --> 00:08:08,840
I think that stuff is great,

288
00:08:08,841 --> 00:08:12,020
and I remember those people who
gave me those important lessons as,

289
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:12,680
as a kid.
