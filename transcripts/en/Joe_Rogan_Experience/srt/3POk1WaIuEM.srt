1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:03,060
All right,
we're live,

2
00:00:03,061 --> 00:00:03,660
dude.
That's it.

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,500
We're going.
Boom.

4
00:00:04,501 --> 00:00:05,520
It's moving.
Just like that.

5
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,290
Just like that.
It's amazing.

6
00:00:07,291 --> 00:00:09,540
It's amazing to have young man like your
show.

7
00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:12,180
You know,
it's one of the few shows where you take

8
00:00:12,181 --> 00:00:17,181
over,
like it's a real problem whenever you 

9
00:00:17,181 --> 00:00:19,020
got a show that's iconic and top gear is
iconic as fuck.

10
00:00:19,021 --> 00:00:22,020
Oh sure.
I mean it's the iconic car show and then

11
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:24,300
they did an Australian version.
They've done other.

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,740
How many versions is,
are there now?

13
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:31,520
Australia was first.
There was a German one really German 

14
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,380
when they did something with them once 
and then that kind of killed them.

15
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:35,910
There was,
there's us,

16
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:39,510
we're still a thing.
There was a top gear Korea for like five

17
00:00:39,511 --> 00:00:42,270
minutes,
which may or may not be going on there.

18
00:00:42,271 --> 00:00:44,550
The ones that drop that Apache 
helicopter,

19
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,990
uh,
in the desert,

20
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,240
everybody was fine.
What was the same?

21
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,930
There was a new,
there's like a Zl one camaro chasing,

22
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:57,200
getting chased by an Apache helicopter,
which is something we did in our first 

23
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,111
season and the same helicopter pilot and
copilot got too close to the.

24
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:03,990
The blades got too close and caught it 
and it dropped him.

25
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:06,870
They walked away,
the helicopters toast.

26
00:01:06,871 --> 00:01:08,160
But then when you hear it,
you start,

27
00:01:08,161 --> 00:01:13,161
there are certain things that happen and
you start to look back at your life and 

28
00:01:13,161 --> 00:01:15,411
go like,
does that mean I could've also almost 

29
00:01:15,411 --> 00:01:15,411
died when we did that?

30
00:01:15,411 --> 00:01:16,680
Like 20 minutes from my house season one
before?

31
00:01:16,681 --> 00:01:17,910
Totally.
Definitely.

32
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:23,120
So luckily that didn't happen.
Apache helicopters are fucking 

33
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:23,330
expensive.
Yes.

34
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,400
The government had all these helicopters
laying around that they couldn't do 

35
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:28,400
anything with.
And uh,

36
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,311
the guy that,
that flute with us was a guy named skip 

37
00:01:32,311 --> 00:01:32,311
lamb and he and a bunch of other pilots 
like,

38
00:01:32,311 --> 00:01:33,270
hey,
we could do stuff with TV,

39
00:01:33,271 --> 00:01:34,140
with movies,
whatever.

40
00:01:34,141 --> 00:01:39,141
So they started this little group and 
the government gave them a bunch of 

41
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:39,670
these surplus helicopters that they 
weren't doing anything with.

42
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:43,950
So they exist and they can do different 
films and movies and it's cool for these

43
00:01:43,951 --> 00:01:48,951
guys because they get to use the skills 
that they had and get to do something 

44
00:01:48,951 --> 00:01:49,410
cool with them.
But again,

45
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,280
it's a real helicopter.
Like it's a bad bitch helicopter that

46
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:58,910
millions to be to be one of those work.
Jamie,

47
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,390
find out what one of those fuckers are 
worth.

48
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,910
We had a,
not those,

49
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,060
but we had a bunch of helicopters that 
we used on fear factor and a lot of 

50
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:08,490
times they were really close to each 
other.

51
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,730
It have to fly staggered where the 
blades of one,

52
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:14,790
we're just above the blades of the other
and they're connected.

53
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:18,390
Both of them connected by ropes to 
something that they're picking up like a

54
00:02:18,391 --> 00:02:22,200
bus or some shit on fucking stupid.
$52 million.

55
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,290
Jesus fucking Christ.
Wow.

56
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,880
Oh my God.

57
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:31,670
I kind don't feel like there's any of 
those on Amazon is what my gut tells me.

58
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:36,880
There might be Ebay for sure.
603% more expensive than the average for

59
00:02:37,311 --> 00:02:42,311
its class.
Were you ever close enough when they 

60
00:02:42,311 --> 00:02:42,311
were doing that and you can feel like 
the wash from them?

61
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:47,540
I assume you've been in a helicopter.
One of my least favorite things in life.

62
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:52,860
I've only been in all honestly.
I never flew in a helicopter the entire 

63
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:52,860
time we did for your factor.
We,

64
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,760
we,
we shot for six fucking years.

65
00:02:54,761 --> 00:02:59,761
Helicopters every other week.
I never got on one good for you because 

66
00:02:59,761 --> 00:03:02,581
I couldn't.
It was part like I would have to be 

67
00:03:02,581 --> 00:03:02,581
insured

68
00:03:02,581 --> 00:03:02,581
due to the helicopter.
Right.

69
00:03:02,581 --> 00:03:03,010
But uh,
I've been on.

70
00:03:03,011 --> 00:03:04,420
I'm on vacation.
I've done that.

71
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:06,760
I'm the Big Island in Hawaii.
Oh yeah,

72
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,280
the volcanoes you've ever done that I've
known,

73
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,510
I've been there once.
It was lovely to.

74
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,950
It's,
it's like literally take it,

75
00:03:14,951 --> 00:03:19,951
takes my breath away just thinking about
it because it's the earth bleeding out 

76
00:03:19,951 --> 00:03:24,570
into the surface.
Middle of nowhere going into the water 

77
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:28,141
and creating the island.
You watched the island be created like 

78
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:31,771
it's every day.
It's like a couple more inches gets 

79
00:03:31,771 --> 00:03:34,981
added to the big island and you could 
actually literally watch it happen and 

80
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:34,981
that's that.
That's it.

81
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:36,670
Like next level stuff.
Meanwhile,

82
00:03:36,671 --> 00:03:40,150
the whole time I'm in there,
I'm thinking like this bitch is going to

83
00:03:40,151 --> 00:03:45,151
go down and he takes off or when it 
lands is the worst part for you because 

84
00:03:45,551 --> 00:03:49,270
you can feel when you feel that when 
push up against the blade and it's like,

85
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:49,810
are we're going to go?

86
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,670
Are we thinking about that?
That's for me,

87
00:03:51,671 --> 00:03:54,850
the pants crapping factor that makes it 
not fun.

88
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:00,660
I've owned a lot of shit boxes and I'm 
sure you're aware of things breaking 

89
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:05,611
like you're on the highway,
but if a wheel falls off,

90
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,780
you and I can pull over exactly if a or 
drops off we make the news.

91
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:13,570
It's not my favorite.
Yeah,

92
00:04:13,571 --> 00:04:15,640
I think there's a way they can kind of 
like.

93
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:18,280
Bill Burr just started flying 
helicopters.

94
00:04:18,281 --> 00:04:23,281
He has his fucking hilarious bit about 
it on his last Netflix special about 

95
00:04:23,281 --> 00:04:28,111
flying helicopters,
but he said that they're not nearly as 

96
00:04:28,111 --> 00:04:31,531
bad to crash as people think they are.
There's a way you learn how to bring 

97
00:04:31,531 --> 00:04:33,730
them down.
I'll pass on that man.

98
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,910
I will and I have for you.
I would probably,

99
00:04:36,911 --> 00:04:39,610
if he ever invite you up then I just 
tell him I'll just meet you there man.

100
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,020
I'll go.
I'll just drive.

101
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,360
I'll go for the story.
I was in high school.

102
00:04:43,361 --> 00:04:46,030
Buddy of mine was taking flight lessons 
when I was in high school.

103
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:51,050
I had a buddy one and his parents were,
who was a wild guys family was his dad 

104
00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:55,900
was a poacher.
He's dead like a out here illegally.

105
00:04:55,901 --> 00:05:00,901
There's a lot of weird shit in their 
family and they were teaching him at a 

106
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:01,330
very young age how to fly planes.
I don't know what the fuck they're going

107
00:05:01,331 --> 00:05:04,060
to do with the plane,
but he came from a very sketchy family.

108
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,080
But uh,
we're gonna like fucking 15.

109
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,190
We were in a plane and I'm like 
[inaudible],

110
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:14,410
well you shouldn't be flying shit.
But we were flying in a little single 

111
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:14,410
engine plane.

112
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:15,210
Man,

113
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,680
one of those little,
one of my best friends flies for Delta 

114
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:20,680
and I,
I tell him,

115
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:20,680
you know,
you travel a lot,

116
00:05:20,681 --> 00:05:25,681
you get it.
But like if I hear his name broadcast 

117
00:05:25,681 --> 00:05:29,261
over the PA,
I'm probably going to get off the plane 

118
00:05:29,261 --> 00:05:30,980
because I've been drunk with them enough
times that it's just,

119
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:36,240
I'm,
I dig that he's in charge of so many 

120
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,240
people's lives.
I just don't know for their.

121
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,420
Did you see the picture of the plane 
that ran into a bird?

122
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:44,050
A commercial jet plane slammed into a 
bird in a caved in the entire front of 

123
00:05:44,241 --> 00:05:45,340
the plane.
No,

124
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:49,150
you didn't say that's awesome though.
Assuming everyone's okay.

125
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:52,310
Everyone lived because it hit it 
perfect.

126
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:57,520
But if you hit the wing,
I mean you look at what it did to the 

127
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:57,520
front of the planet,
like give it hit,

128
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:57,920
hit,
you know,

129
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,310
six

130
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,840
feet to the left,
six feet to the right,

131
00:05:59,841 --> 00:06:04,841
whatever you look like people might have
died or if it landed the through the 

132
00:06:04,841 --> 00:06:09,221
windshield and it killed the pilot.
I mean you've gotta if you're hitting 

133
00:06:09,221 --> 00:06:12,590
like a Canadian ghosts,
like one of those bright fucking giant 

134
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,310
geese vineyard trying to land in the 
Hudson.

135
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,640
Yeah.
It's like that story.

136
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,810
Yeah.
So there's this place in Georgia near me

137
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:24,970
where we shot the same place with the 
helicopter and they are the people that 

138
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:25,590
go and recover airplanes.
Look at it.

139
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,380
There's the impact.
Holy Cow,

140
00:06:27,381 --> 00:06:28,430
right?
Just boom.

141
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,790
Soft spot right in there.
So when the plane went down the Hudson,

142
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:36,820
these redneck dudes from Griffin,
Georgia were sent up there to get the 

143
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,980
plane that's floating in the water,
right?

144
00:06:39,981 --> 00:06:44,981
Insurance companies pay them to go and 
recover these planes and they have to 

145
00:06:45,561 --> 00:06:47,030
basically cut them up,
get them on a,

146
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,920
on a train or a flat bed or whatever.

147
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:53,920
And so for Christmas,
one of our executive producer for top 

148
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:53,920
gear,
he was like showing me,

149
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:58,660
Oh,
here's some stuff I got from Ronnie and 

150
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,510
my buddies back in Georgia.
And it was a tiny bottle of Jack Daniels

151
00:06:59,511 --> 00:07:01,460
that looked like it had mold growing on 
the outside.

152
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,520
And it was one of the bottles that was 
in the plane that went down on the 

153
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,421
Hudson and these guys were covered it.
And that was his Christmas keepsake to 

154
00:07:09,421 --> 00:07:10,580
his friends.
That's funny.

155
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,660
Wow.
That's probably worth money things.

156
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:17,850
So then on Ebay and there's like,
there's this cool like [inaudible] 

157
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:18,890
looking and I was like,
oh,

158
00:07:18,891 --> 00:07:19,850
that looks neat.
What?

159
00:07:19,851 --> 00:07:20,500
Like,
uh,

160
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,010
I landed that.
And the guy was like,

161
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:27,011
oh no,
that plane hit the water and the Panama 

162
00:07:27,011 --> 00:07:27,011
City,
that guy died.

163
00:07:27,011 --> 00:07:31,900
You couldn't have a more trite like 
business unless maybe you're an 

164
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:31,900
undertaker.
I don't,

165
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,090
I don't know.

166
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,340
Maybe a funeral service director,
I'm not sure.

167
00:07:34,341 --> 00:07:39,341
But you have to basically go pick up 
crap after bill burr and his friends 

168
00:07:39,341 --> 00:07:40,910
learn how to roll a helicopter that's 
going down safely.

169
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,810
Didn't Patrick swayze crashed drunk?
Wasn't uh,

170
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:48,850
something that happened?
I believe Patrick swayze before he died 

171
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:49,850
was boozing it up,
flying around with his cancer.

172
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,370
He's not so happy with just going for 
it.

173
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:54,560
Just getting hammered and flying around.
I mean,

174
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:58,760
he had cancer for quite a while and uh,
was flying planes.

175
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:03,860
I think he crashed one of them.
I'm pretty sure he crashed one of them 

176
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,401
and walked away until it's hardcore.
And was it a Harrison Ford that just 

177
00:08:06,401 --> 00:08:07,850
landed one on a,
on a golf course?

178
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:08,990
Yeah,
he crashed,

179
00:08:08,991 --> 00:08:10,790
landed somewhere.
Harrison Ford.

180
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:13,660
He apparently,
he got pretty banged up like that was a,

181
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:18,700
that was a real crush swayze.
Suspected drunk flying was in 2000 

182
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,020
skews.

183
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:21,550
Me.
Yeah.

184
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:26,570
Three men are facing misdemeanor charges
in connection with Patrick swayze 

185
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:26,570
emergency landing.
Earlier this month,

186
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:31,481
the men are accused of failing to tell 
authorities about how they allegedly 

187
00:08:31,481 --> 00:08:33,590
held the act to remove alcoholic 
beverages from his crashed plane.

188
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,230
He was doing it,
man.

189
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:39,260
He's fucking dirty dancing guy.
Come on,

190
00:08:39,261 --> 00:08:40,700
he's roadhouse.
Let them,

191
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:45,900
you know,
it's weird that like Patrick swayze 

192
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,580
would wear stuff in those movies that 
like if our friends war,

193
00:08:46,581 --> 00:08:49,130
we'd kind of make fun of Patrick swayze 
ways.

194
00:08:49,131 --> 00:08:50,870
You're like,
that guy can dance.

195
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,730
Only because he didn't know him.
If you got to know him after awhile,

196
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,160
you start mocking them if hanging around
with him.

197
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,560
You met Patrick swayze and he was like 
dancing.

198
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,250
You'd be like,
Hey,

199
00:08:59,251 --> 00:09:04,251
that's pretty cool.
And then like five minutes later I'd be 

200
00:09:04,251 --> 00:09:04,251
like,
uh,

201
00:09:04,251 --> 00:09:05,730
do you do sports or just fucking dance 
around you play golf?

202
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:06,650
Or like what?
What is,

203
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,590
uh,
do you have friends?

204
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,930
Do you hang around with like on a 
Tuesday?

205
00:09:09,931 --> 00:09:14,931
You know,
Mckell Baryshnikov or some shit like 

206
00:09:14,931 --> 00:09:14,931
there.
There's roadhouse.

207
00:09:14,931 --> 00:09:17,700
Roadhouse wouldn't move.
It wasn't a man playing the guitar.

208
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,090
I'm the blind guy.
Yeah.

209
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:23,400
That guy was really good.
He was really good.

210
00:09:23,401 --> 00:09:25,020
Whatever happened to that dude got 
killed.

211
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,780
Yeah.
Dive.

212
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,070
I think it was in a car wreck.
He wasn't driving.

213
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:34,210
I'm sure as you know,
that's not a joke against and I just got

214
00:09:34,211 --> 00:09:37,500
asked the same question.
That was a really good musician.

215
00:09:37,501 --> 00:09:39,330
He was great.
That's right.

216
00:09:39,331 --> 00:09:40,490
He was in and I forgot it was in it.

217
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:41,280
And that.
Sam,

218
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:42,600
Jeff,
he leaf healy.

219
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:43,690
Thank you.
How did he die?

220
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,200
Find it for us.
This is the.

221
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,830
Can I get somebody like that that just 
goes with going places,

222
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,250
right?
So it's more fun with someone else.

223
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,310
You can continue your thought.
That's the benefit when you're have,

224
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,360
when you have a podcast.
Died of cancer.

225
00:10:00,361 --> 00:10:03,180
Underwent surgery to remove metastic 
tissue from both lungs.

226
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,870
And that's what in Alabama,
that's what we call a car wreck.

227
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,010
So my bad,
I got.

228
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,570
I categorized that wrong.
Well,

229
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:15,590
we were talking before the podcast and 
we were talking about muscle cars and 

230
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:19,170
we're talking about mustangs and Mustang
people being weird like that.

231
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,270
You're not the only one who's ever said 
that to me.

232
00:10:21,271 --> 00:10:25,230
I haven't experienced this except in 
high school when I was in high school,

233
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:29,190
my um,
auto shop teacher was a mustang fanatic.

234
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:29,580
Okay.

235
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:30,590
The guy was nuts.
Sure.

236
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:34,590
And he had all these old shitty mustangs
and he'd like to put back together again

237
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:39,920
and they were all like,
fucking heat that students do the Bondo 

238
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:39,920
on them.
They're all,

239
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:39,920
you know,
look at them sideways.

240
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,550
It was like looking at a fucking ski 
slope.

241
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,250
Right.
They're just completely fucked up.

242
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,640
But he was weird and he just,
he didn't look like any other cars.

243
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,710
He's like,
I like mustangs just hardcore,

244
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:52,980
just all he wanted and he even like,
he didn't even like the cool ones,

245
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:54,750
like,
you know,

246
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:59,580
shitty hubcaps and like he never,
he never like did them up nice.

247
00:10:59,581 --> 00:11:03,480
And where they look like something,
I would want muscle cars,

248
00:11:03,481 --> 00:11:05,370
but in his mind they were,
they were the jam.

249
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,920
Yeah.
It was a mustang or nothing.

250
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,070
That was his thing,
and to quantify it a tiny bit,

251
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:16,071
you told me that you were kind of 
thinking about building a car and it's 

252
00:11:16,071 --> 00:11:16,071
maybe a Chevelle or maybe a mustang.

253
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,690
I think there's lots of.
If you look at the car world,

254
00:11:18,691 --> 00:11:19,060
man,
there's,

255
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:22,950
there's so many different pockets of 
people and this stuff that they like and

256
00:11:22,951 --> 00:11:26,010
I.
I was never a big mustang guy.

257
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,590
I dig them.
I get why people love them,

258
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:31,530
but like let's pick the Fox body,
right?

259
00:11:31,531 --> 00:11:36,531
That's the 79 to 93 and they made a few 
changes in their.

260
00:11:37,771 --> 00:11:41,010
Like they had the tops and a few death.
Those cars were desk.

261
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,060
They're just ship there in vanilla ice 
is a number one song.

262
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:45,840
Write doom,
doom,

263
00:11:45,841 --> 00:11:47,860
doom,
doom with a rag top down below.

264
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,460
And I did that,
but that's what that car was like.

265
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:55,461
To me.
It's a great representation of sort of 

266
00:11:55,461 --> 00:11:56,740
like a redneck mullet,
late eighties,

267
00:11:56,741 --> 00:11:58,530
early nineties kind of style.
Well,

268
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,880
I on my show,
lost and transmission,

269
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:03,880
we had to take one.
I've found it in my buddy's junkyard.

270
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:07,570
I needed an engine and transmission and 
try to make this AMC Eagle.

271
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,710
Cool,
right?

272
00:12:08,711 --> 00:12:13,711
I couldn't keep the car all wheel drive.
It was like a jacked up ugly four by 

273
00:12:13,711 --> 00:12:17,191
four.
I couldn't keep it all wheel drive and 

274
00:12:17,191 --> 00:12:17,191
have any amount of power.
So I said,

275
00:12:17,191 --> 00:12:17,200
all right,
let's make it rear wheel drive.

276
00:12:17,201 --> 00:12:21,010
Let's make it something cool.
So I had to basically sacrifice this Fox

277
00:12:21,011 --> 00:12:23,830
body and do people came out of the 
woodwork.

278
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:26,770
I don't know how active you are on so I 
know you are,

279
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:30,550
but like sometimes when people try to 
get mad at you on facebook,

280
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,970
it's so much funnier to read and you're 
like,

281
00:12:33,971 --> 00:12:38,971
this goes so pissed.
He forgot that English is a language 

282
00:12:38,971 --> 00:12:42,580
because it's just a hail of words and 
like he tried to call this one fox body 

283
00:12:42,941 --> 00:12:46,120
rare and I made fun of him and then 
other people saw it.

284
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,400
Not like in a mean way,
I just poked back,

285
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:50,320
but like there's no fox body that's 
rare.

286
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:55,950
Those pictures back up again and let's 
all agree that these should all be put 

287
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,930
in a pile and nuked awful,
disgusting cars.

288
00:12:58,931 --> 00:13:02,890
The worst representation of American 
muscle cars that have ever been built.

289
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,240
Look at that girl in the hood.
Even.

290
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,460
She's not enthusiastic.
She's like this.

291
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,470
I hate my boyfriend.
Chaz Chaz.

292
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:14,490
He's an asshole.
He makes them get on top of his car and 

293
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:14,490
you know,
that's.

294
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:18,940
That's like an Lx.
Five point on my might have been a four 

295
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:18,940
cylinder.
I don't know.

296
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,840
I'll look at the girl with the pink one.
Oh yeah.

297
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,770
Oh yeah.
You totally want to buy her some boone's

298
00:13:23,771 --> 00:13:25,330
farm.
Look at you girl.

299
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:29,260
I like how they redid the back lights.
They got crafted the fucking lights.

300
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:35,590
All Teza style.
It supposed to be a muscle car and they 

301
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:35,950
had four lug wheels.

302
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,350
It was a disgusting car.
My friend,

303
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:40,360
my buddy Kevin,
Jason had one when we were kids.

304
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:44,950
He had A.
I'm not saying you can't make on cool.

305
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,810
Oh yeah.
I mean they're kind of cool.

306
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,310
They're kind of cool.
It's cool,

307
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:53,400
but they're not cool compared to the 60s
mustangs and the not cool compared to 

308
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,240
the new ones.
The new ones are fucking bad.

309
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,380
They're dope.
Right?

310
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:01,500
And really they got,
they got better than what was the next 

311
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,981
one.
So in 95 or would it not to be a total 

312
00:14:04,981 --> 00:14:04,981
dork?
I know codes and stuff,

313
00:14:04,981 --> 00:14:05,950
I said,
but shouldn't they got cooler,

314
00:14:05,951 --> 00:14:06,640
right?
They did.

315
00:14:06,641 --> 00:14:08,200
They got better.
They got,

316
00:14:08,201 --> 00:14:11,490
they were kind of decent.
And then in the two thousands,

317
00:14:11,491 --> 00:14:14,440
like I had a 2010 shelby gt,
500.

318
00:14:14,441 --> 00:14:16,420
That's bad.
That's a bad ass car.

319
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:18,280
It was a vicious car.
But it was,

320
00:14:18,281 --> 00:14:20,440
you know,
live rear axle.

321
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,210
The handling properties weren't the 
best,

322
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:24,330
but it wasn't about that.
That car was about.

323
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:28,540
It could go sideways anytime you want 
her to know anybody around.

324
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:33,541
No hit it.
I would just go sideways around corners.

325
00:14:33,611 --> 00:14:35,380
I mean it was so easy,
right?

326
00:14:35,381 --> 00:14:40,381
Just anytime you wanted to just give it 
a little juice and it would just kick 

327
00:14:40,381 --> 00:14:43,531
out the back for you.
And there's only really only a handful 

328
00:14:43,531 --> 00:14:44,350
of cars that you feel like when you see 
someone on the road in,

329
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:45,490
you know,
sometimes people,

330
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:50,520
it's not that they're messing with you,
they're just not bright enough to know 

331
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,161
how to be a good driver.
That's one of those cars you would 

332
00:14:53,161 --> 00:14:53,161
always see a dude in a mustang just be 
like,

333
00:14:53,161 --> 00:14:54,830
I've had enough of your crap.
I'm out,

334
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,190
I'm going to drop the hammer and I go.
So like I always liked that about him,

335
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:03,460
but there's just certain cars that 
people that love them are sometimes 

336
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:03,620
just.

337
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:07,310
They turned me off of the car,
like I always wanted a he 46 m,

338
00:15:07,311 --> 00:15:08,480
three BMW.
Right.

339
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,390
That to me it's just such a great car 
out of the box,

340
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:14,090
but then when I would meet a lot of the 
people that would own them,

341
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,630
I would decide.
I don't think I really went wrong.

342
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:19,270
One.
I've heard that about Porsche's.

343
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:21,710
Do people have always said that about 
porsches?

344
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,960
Magnus Walker is changing that for me.
Yes,

345
00:15:23,961 --> 00:15:28,160
he is that guy.
How could you not love magnus?

346
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:33,161
First off,
he's just as bad ass dude that just 

347
00:15:33,161 --> 00:15:33,230
likes what he likes.
Well,

348
00:15:33,231 --> 00:15:36,560
he's also so enthusiastic about it.
That's contagious.

349
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:41,640
Yeah,
he loves those like 60 to 73 and now 

350
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:41,640
he's.
He.

351
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,600
He's in some turbos now.
Some older turbo models.

352
00:15:43,601 --> 00:15:48,601
Sure.
Although he loves his [inaudible] 30 

353
00:15:48,601 --> 00:15:48,601
now.
A bunch of those.

354
00:15:48,601 --> 00:15:49,120
Yeah,
and I think your buddies at shark works.

355
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,680
Took him a newer one,
like a 14,

356
00:15:51,681 --> 00:15:53,960
that he got to go beat around on it and 
suddenly he was like,

357
00:15:53,961 --> 00:15:56,870
maybe the new ones aren't so bad.
Well he knows now.

358
00:15:56,871 --> 00:16:00,170
Well he had never experienced anything 
like the GT two.

359
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,330
So what Alex did,
Alex,

360
00:16:02,331 --> 00:16:05,900
my buddy from shark works,
took a gt two from,

361
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:09,390
I want to say it's 2010 maybe somewhere 
around there.

362
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,720
And um,
he made it 800 horsepower and it is the 

363
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,170
fucking scariest car I've ever driven in
my life.

364
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,750
I mean,
it's fucking terrifying.

365
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:22,860
Like my gt three has 518 horsepower that
has almost 300 more horsepower.

366
00:16:24,321 --> 00:16:27,910
It's somewhere in the eight.
It's a mind bogglingly fast.

367
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:31,160
It's a fucking time machine.
And he lead magnets,

368
00:16:31,161 --> 00:16:36,161
drive it,
and he said to do with it whatever you 

369
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:36,710
would do if it was your own car.
So Magnus had it fucking painted,

370
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:37,200
right?

371
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,360
Yeah.
But that's how cool Alex is.

372
00:16:39,361 --> 00:16:41,000
And that's how cool magnets,
they just,

373
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:45,380
they're both fanatics so they just have 
this understanding with each other.

374
00:16:45,381 --> 00:16:47,660
So this is what he did to it.
You can see it there.

375
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,060
He painted.
I think it's ugly as fuck.

376
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,070
Go.
Come on with testing.

377
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,880
I love the golden wheels on there.
First wheels not aren't bad,

378
00:16:55,881 --> 00:17:00,881
but the orange and the bumpers like why 
it has that very like German dtm kind of

379
00:17:01,191 --> 00:17:03,560
look to it like shit.
It looks like dog shit.

380
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:07,760
It's a great card since it's such a 
beautiful design though.

381
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:11,660
It doesn't need fucking gray stripes in 
the hood and Orange Burger.

382
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,160
But whatever.
Something my car.

383
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,710
But the bottom line is driving it 
though.

384
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:17,960
What a goddamn experience.
Yeah,

385
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,840
it's terrifying.
We took it up.

386
00:17:20,841 --> 00:17:22,190
Um,
Angel's crest.

387
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,190
Oh yeah.
That area.

388
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,700
And you can't drive it up.

389
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,990
It's too fast.
It,

390
00:17:26,991 --> 00:17:30,830
every corner comes to quick.
And that's one of those cars.

391
00:17:30,831 --> 00:17:33,920
That is,
when the power comes on,

392
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:36,110
it is,
doesn't matter how they've tuned at your

393
00:17:36,111 --> 00:17:38,450
foot is not a machine.
You're foot is like,

394
00:17:38,451 --> 00:17:39,710
hey,
let's do this.

395
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,890
All the sudden you think,
oh,

396
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:45,650
maybe I'll shoot off this hill,
or is this because you can't.

397
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:49,380
It's hard to drive that car in control 
no matter who you are.

398
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:50,790
Well,
I had never really thought.

399
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:55,230
I never been in a car that had too much 
power before where I drove it.

400
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:56,700
I've always been like,
whoa,

401
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:59,140
this is fast.
Like the shelby gt 500.

402
00:17:59,141 --> 00:18:02,190
It was like 550 horsepower.
Pretty light car.

403
00:18:02,191 --> 00:18:03,150
I'm like,
God damn,

404
00:18:03,151 --> 00:18:04,980
this thing is fast,
ridiculously fast.

405
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:08,610
The GT three super fast,
but that is in a different category.

406
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:13,490
So it's mind boggling how much power it 
has and when it kicks in,

407
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,890
just pinned you to the child.

408
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,100
It Ah,
ah.

409
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:21,390
Your heart starts racing like I'm going 
to die.

410
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,350
This kid,
this kid,

411
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,940
this is,
this is physics.

412
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,530
You're like,
I get a James Dean.

413
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:31,150
Sinking feeling brother on a highway 
apparently is even scarier.

414
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,960
They were saying on the highway,
you just don't feel compelled to let off

415
00:18:33,961 --> 00:18:38,961
the gas.
And so you look down and you go in 170 

416
00:18:38,961 --> 00:18:38,961
miles an hour on the [inaudible] and 
you're like,

417
00:18:38,961 --> 00:18:41,790
what the fuck am I doing last season?
Top gear we went to,

418
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:44,220
we went to Germany,
we drove on the nurburgring.

419
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,400
Have you ever been in that ring?
Is like being inside of a of a video 

420
00:18:49,831 --> 00:18:54,831
game for folks who aren't car geeks.
The Nuremberg ring is the track that 

421
00:18:54,931 --> 00:18:57,750
everyone talks about when talking about 
lap times.

422
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:02,920
Like if you have a car that can do seven
minutes and 30 seconds or below on the 

423
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,370
nurburgring you've got a mother fucker.

424
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:08,050
It's car motherfucker.
What?

425
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,680
The record is just under seven minutes 
right now.

426
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:13,170
So it,
it's for the 12 minute course,

427
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,060
right?
It's 14 if you run the whole thing.

428
00:19:15,061 --> 00:19:20,061
But the 12 minute courses is like just 
under seven for some unbelievably fast 

429
00:19:20,061 --> 00:19:20,760
thing.
When,

430
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:23,370
when we went there,
they tanner's got a friend over there,

431
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:24,330
right?
And Faust,

432
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,730
[inaudible] spouse.
Who's The you?

433
00:19:26,731 --> 00:19:27,510
Adam for our,
uh,

434
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,410
and tanner.
Yes.

435
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,840
Of top gear.
Do Dude.

436
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:31,980
Gosh,
he loves you,

437
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:32,610
you guys.
It's,

438
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:34,110
it's like,
I love that comedy.

439
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:39,140
It's like one gigantic,
a fraternity and sorority that everyone 

440
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,260
likes everyone,
unless you're that one.

441
00:19:40,261 --> 00:19:45,261
A whole does a few of them.
We could go into that for guys that 

442
00:19:45,261 --> 00:19:45,820
needed to be killed.
Exactly.

443
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,860
Climate in the body of those shitty old 
mustangs and newcomb from orbit.

444
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,660
But tanner tanner's got a friend who is 
friends with the owner,

445
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,920
the people that just bought it.

446
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:59,310
So they closed the nurburgring for us 
with God for three hours.

447
00:19:59,311 --> 00:20:01,280
We had to track all to ourselves.
Wow,

448
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:06,360
dude,
that's the most insane thing I've ever 

449
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,541
done in my life.
And I was in a 2014 carerra ass for us.

450
00:20:08,991 --> 00:20:12,930
So it's a non turbo all wheel drive and 
it's a little over 300 horsepower,

451
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,520
right?
It's about four.

452
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:17,220
I think it maybe you're right,
it's about four horsepower.

453
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,660
You could kill yourself on that track.
And uh,

454
00:20:19,661 --> 00:20:23,160
you go maybe on a bicycle on a,
on a good downhill.

455
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:26,940
Every turn is a blind turn.
Every hill is a blind hill.

456
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:32,270
I hit one 82 on the back stretch.
And then like on the way there we were,

457
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:39,560
we were trying to hit the rev limiter on
the Autobahn because people know how to 

458
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,250
drive on the interstate there.
It's the most amazing thing.

459
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:46,310
They get on the right hand lane and they
stay there until they need to use the 

460
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:46,310
left.
And then they just like California.

461
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,070
Unless I'm like any work

462
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,770
before you use the word everywhere I've 
lived,

463
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:53,530
California's still worse when it comes 
to getting out of that left lane.

464
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,190
Nobody respects it.
Literally was slow down.

465
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,790
I'm going fast enough.
Yeah.

466
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:01,100
I'm just going to patrol this on my own 
horn.

467
00:21:01,101 --> 00:21:02,920
Yeah,
I've always lived in California.

468
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,250
I don't know anything about tomorrow 
rounds because they kind of designed the

469
00:21:06,251 --> 00:21:08,700
roads out here for a bunch of cars.
Right?

470
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,420
There's no.
Like when I first came here,

471
00:21:10,421 --> 00:21:15,421
one of the first things that I did,
I drove down to was a place called hard 

472
00:21:15,421 --> 00:21:15,421
times billiards in bellflower,
California.

473
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:18,430
It's like a legendary pool hall and I 
drove down there and I,

474
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,870
you have to take four or five,
get down there.

475
00:21:19,871 --> 00:21:22,420
I was like,
look at this fucking road.

476
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,580
It's like seven lanes on each side.
I'm like,

477
00:21:24,581 --> 00:21:27,070
this is insane.
And Massachusetts where I grew up,

478
00:21:27,071 --> 00:21:28,090
there's nothing like that.

479
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:29,110
Right?
They didn't exist.

480
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:34,230
There were like horse and buggy roads 
and someone can put hard pavement over 

481
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:34,230
here.
You know,

482
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,860
potholes everywhere.
Yeah.

483
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:37,520
The road down here.
It's.

484
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:43,110
This is like the best car culture in the
world and the worst driving conditions 

485
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,890
for car people.
Certainly for traffic.

486
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,520
It's on dude.
I don't know.

487
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:47,200
3:00
AM.

488
00:21:47,201 --> 00:21:48,840
You guys can have traffic.
Yup.

489
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,880
In the middle of nowhere.
That bumper to bumper for no real 

490
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:53,880
reason.
The real reason is people.

491
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,711
Fuck.
And they made babies and then they move 

492
00:21:58,711 --> 00:21:58,820
out here because they want to be famous.
I mean,

493
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,250
don't.
You're wrong if you go nowhere,

494
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:05,340
if you go south.
I mean there are some great roads to 

495
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:05,340
drive here.
Yeah.

496
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:08,940
But you,
it'll take you six hours to go five 

497
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:08,940
miles to find them.
Right.

498
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,290
I'm just,
I'm so nervous going anywhere here.

499
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:16,500
I was five minutes away and just 
crapping my pants about if I could get 

500
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:16,500
here on time or not.

501
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:16,500
Uh,
yeah.

502
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,360
It's it's nerve wracking place if you 
want to be punctual,

503
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,670
but that dude run.
Let's lose it.

504
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,610
Let's go to the nurburgring.
What was your time?

505
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,330
Did you.
How fast did you get around it?

506
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:31,380
Did whatever.
I think I was under 10 minutes from my 

507
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:31,670
first slap.
That's pretty God damn good.

508
00:22:31,671 --> 00:22:34,180
And they said that's first time seeing 
the track.

509
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,660
That's great.
You should feel really good about that.

510
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:39,760
You lose it at any point in time or just
get close to the edge.

511
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:45,160
The carousel is the coolest feeling I've
ever had because you dip in and it's it.

512
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:46,990
There's graffiti everywhere,
right?

513
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:51,991
Because they have these huge parties out
there around the races and so you're 

514
00:22:51,991 --> 00:22:55,171
seeing all this stuff in the car just 
dips in and you're hauling ass as hard 

515
00:22:55,171 --> 00:22:59,491
as you can and then it just shoots you 
right out the other side and you keep 

516
00:22:59,491 --> 00:22:59,491
going and you're like,
I just did it.

517
00:22:59,491 --> 00:23:02,800
So the carousel is like a site,
like you're almost going sideways like a

518
00:23:02,801 --> 00:23:03,700
bank.
Yes.

519
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:08,740
It's just steep bank to just kind of 
pops in out of nowhere and you just get 

520
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,460
any kind of.
Just ride it.

521
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,910
There it is right there.
It's so.

522
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:16,450
It's so amazing.
And the whole time I kept thinking,

523
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,330
what am I doing here?
Like how did this happen?

524
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:23,590
How did this goofball kid from Atlanta 
end up on this show?

525
00:23:23,591 --> 00:23:26,700
And they handed me a car and the keys to
the nerve,

526
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:30,010
greg to a German porsche,
modern German Porsche.

527
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:31,930
It was,
it was insane.

528
00:23:31,931 --> 00:23:36,931
And they do the coolest part about that 
road in that track on days when there 

529
00:23:36,931 --> 00:23:41,161
aren't races,
it's a toll road so you can pay $30 and 

530
00:23:41,161 --> 00:23:42,040
go take a lap.
Really?

531
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:47,190
So there are guys like you and I who 
were there who either showed up with a 

532
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:47,420
[inaudible],
rented one,

533
00:23:47,421 --> 00:23:47,930
whatever.

534
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,300
Right?
So they're going out and having fun.

535
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,330
You still have to use your blinker and 
you can only pass on the left,

536
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:58,810
which is hilarious to me.
But there's also like grandmothers and 

537
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:00,860
families in tourists on the track at the
same time.

538
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,400
So you're just going to do it.
But people really going.

539
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:06,980
And so we're standing there,
we had just wrapped up and I was like,

540
00:24:06,981 --> 00:24:09,260
let's see if we got five minutes,
I just want to watch some cars.

541
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:11,900
You see this mini cooper come hauling 
ass around.

542
00:24:11,901 --> 00:24:14,240
Right.
And this dude's just carving and there's

543
00:24:14,241 --> 00:24:16,360
a guy in a f four 30,
he's like,

544
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:21,370
I can keep up with this son of a bitch.
And he punted that for 30 into the wall 

545
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:26,510
on one side and then drug it down past 
us now because it's a toll road,

546
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,880
they have to do an accident 
investigation.

547
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:31,520
The money's gone.
The mini coopers checked out.

548
00:24:31,521 --> 00:24:33,080
It's not.
He didn't have anything to do with it,

549
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,850
but he,
I think he still felt bad.

550
00:24:34,851 --> 00:24:39,851
So everybody that was on the track at 
that point has to exit and this team 

551
00:24:39,851 --> 00:24:44,021
shows up and they do like an accident 
investigation because that guy's 

552
00:24:44,021 --> 00:24:46,541
insurance would still be good on the 
track at that moment because it was a 

553
00:24:46,541 --> 00:24:47,000
toll road.
That's hilarious.

554
00:24:47,001 --> 00:24:51,270
So how fast can you go?
I had one 83 and there's no Schema.

555
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:53,000
No,
you could just go.

556
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:56,690
And I was not the fastest car we had.
What kind of fucking insurance that they

557
00:24:56,691 --> 00:25:01,691
have underneath crazy.
It's because you've heard of friends 

558
00:25:01,691 --> 00:25:01,850
that are like,
oh,

559
00:25:01,851 --> 00:25:06,851
I took this new car to the track and 
then I had to pay the tow truck guy to 

560
00:25:06,851 --> 00:25:06,851
drop it on the side of the four.
Oh,

561
00:25:06,851 --> 00:25:08,120
five.
So I can call the insurance company.

562
00:25:08,121 --> 00:25:11,150
Tell them I don't know what happened.
I was sitting here,

563
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:15,160
so I guess it just works out better,
but you can rent a racecar.

564
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:20,170
They're either like a Peugeot or they 
have all these like little kind of 

565
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:23,670
import smaller race cars you can rent.
It says like rent a racecar.

566
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,100
Just go for it.

567
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,890
Well if you get a Nissan Gtr,
they have a.

568
00:25:27,891 --> 00:25:32,891
They have a speed limiter on it until 
you get to race courses and the GPS 

569
00:25:32,891 --> 00:25:35,510
recognizes that you're at a race course.
That's awesome.

570
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,670
And it lets you just go fucking crazy.

571
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:40,440
Have you have you journal on such a 
great car for the money?

572
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:41,580
Did one.
Did you?

573
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,330
Yes,
I rented one in Austin,

574
00:25:43,331 --> 00:25:45,610
Texas.
If you go to um,

575
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,280
ah,
it hurts.

576
00:25:48,281 --> 00:25:48,780
I think it's hurting.

577
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:52,630
Hertz has some pretty ridiculous cars 
that you could share and if you wanna if

578
00:25:52,631 --> 00:25:54,460
you wanna pay,
they'll let you run a GTR.

579
00:25:54,461 --> 00:25:56,230
I was like,
whew.

580
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,930
So the whole weekend I was like,
I was riding a ride everywhere.

581
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,210
Just what I mean.
It's.

582
00:26:00,211 --> 00:26:02,400
I mean,
for the supercar world,

583
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:04,670
it's such a bargain.
That car.

584
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:07,450
I mean it's,
they're getting more expensive now.

585
00:26:07,451 --> 00:26:09,220
There is somewhere around a hundred 
grand now.

586
00:26:09,221 --> 00:26:12,330
They were like seven and nine I think 
was when they first came out.

587
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,050
Yeah,
and it was like fully loaded.

588
00:26:14,051 --> 00:26:16,030
Now they keep adding a little bit,
a little bit more.

589
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:21,120
They're a little bit over a hundred now,
but the way they handle is like it 

590
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,411
defies physics.
It doesn't feel like the gt three 

591
00:26:25,411 --> 00:26:28,861
handles amazing,
but it makes sense that car does not 

592
00:26:28,861 --> 00:26:31,570
make sense because there's all sorts of 
electronics going on.

593
00:26:31,571 --> 00:26:33,050
It's four wheel drive.
It's three.

594
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:38,090
It's very heavy.
It's probably like eight or 900 pounds 

595
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,040
heavier than my gt three.
About 3,900

596
00:26:39,041 --> 00:26:40,150
pounds or something like that.
I think.

597
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:44,070
I think it's a fairly heavy car and 
that's like part their strategy in

598
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:47,220
some sort of strange way,
but it fucking works.

599
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:52,400
That is an ungodly fast ride and it's 
just hop in and go kart.

600
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:55,470
Tanner doesn't like it because it takes 
so much.

601
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,230
He feels like a way from a driver at 
that skill level,

602
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:00,600
but you and I are in fact not tanner 
foust.

603
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:03,420
I don't feel like I.
I feel that same way,

604
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:08,660
but one of my favorite episodes of your 
show was when he was racing with a 

605
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:13,191
motorcycle around all these industrial 
box core zero six

606
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:16,390
down in Long Beach.
It

607
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:21,390
was nuts is when you can watch someone 
drift and entire cloverleaf onramp.

608
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:26,730
Yeah,
and I think the city of Long Beach try 

609
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,891
to get mad at US afterwards.
Really saw all the stripes that we had 

610
00:27:28,891 --> 00:27:29,650
done.
And you're like,

611
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,250
no,
no.

612
00:27:30,251 --> 00:27:32,140
You gave us permission.
Sorry.

613
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:34,420
They were mad because it was rubber on 
the road.

614
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:36,130
That looks cool.
That's what I say.

615
00:27:36,131 --> 00:27:37,720
Pussies.
I don't know what their deal is.

616
00:27:37,721 --> 00:27:38,620
Died.
Yeah.

617
00:27:38,621 --> 00:27:41,950
Fucking was a drift drift bike.
Right.

618
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:44,950
And he only had like three degrees of of
slip on it.

619
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,320
Still bad.
It is right here for the record.

620
00:27:47,321 --> 00:27:50,650
But you just see how good a driver 
tanner is in this video,

621
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,880
especially with those shitty dog shits.
God is fighting core vets.

622
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:01,500
Who the fuck allowed that?
That was such a glaring error on their 

623
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:05,671
part to make this incredible car.
I mean ridiculously fast car.

624
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:09,700
And then give it these dog shit seats to
terrible.

625
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:12,520
I had a CEO sick for about five minutes.
So you.

626
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:14,120
It was awesome.
It was not.

627
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,580
Again,
I'm not a corvette guy.

628
00:28:15,581 --> 00:28:20,581
Like you wouldn't,
you wouldn't see me get out of the car 

629
00:28:20,581 --> 00:28:23,341
and think that guy has got a vet because
I don't have like a gold chain not 

630
00:28:23,341 --> 00:28:24,490
wearing jean shorts.
Nowhere she.

631
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,390
Right.
Or George shorts,

632
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:28,930
if you will,
for their very popular thing.

633
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,940
Were they aware?
Do they do they do.

634
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:33,160
And I,
it was atomic orange.

635
00:28:33,161 --> 00:28:34,600
I got it from my friend Kevin,
uh,

636
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:36,460
in Chicago.
Give me a killer deal on it.

637
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:38,800
And it was one of those cars at once.
You drove.

638
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:40,860
Once you got in that [inaudible] it was 
a [inaudible],

639
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:46,010
atomic orange.
Everything about core vets change 

640
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:46,010
because that.
I mean it's the same as that car.

641
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:49,540
It's just such.
It's a mean ass car so fast,

642
00:28:49,541 --> 00:28:53,560
so fast,
so fun and really well balanced to where

643
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,480
those cars are shockingly well balanced.

644
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:00,480
It's just because it's plastic and 
American sheets and the seats are dog 

645
00:29:00,791 --> 00:29:02,450
shit.
You just think like,

646
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,570
well this is a fucking terrible car,
but it's not if you.

647
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:05,830
If they just.
If someone,

648
00:29:05,831 --> 00:29:10,831
if you took it somewhere and just had 
some really good bucket seats installed 

649
00:29:10,831 --> 00:29:14,040
the ride experience and then the 
steering wheel's dog shit to the 

650
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,040
cavaliers.
Yeah.

651
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:19,040
That was always my beef.
You could get the same radio in the 

652
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,160
corvette that you could in the last 10.
Now it's just not how that's supposed to

653
00:29:21,161 --> 00:29:21,770
work.
No,

654
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:24,040
but they did fix that.
Yeah.

655
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:29,070
I mean the c seven c six zero six and a 
GTR had an illegitimate child and that's

656
00:29:30,281 --> 00:29:31,780
what they.
That's what they spit out.

657
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:34,020
He even made it better than anybody 
anticipated.

658
00:29:34,021 --> 00:29:37,300
Like the new [inaudible] is a 
motherfucker a car.

659
00:29:37,301 --> 00:29:42,301
I mean it a really incredible,
incredible car and that's just them 

660
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:42,970
listening.

661
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,850
You know what?
You got to appreciate goodness.

662
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:48,820
They listened and they even engineered 
it like way better than the other ones.

663
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:52,660
I mean the new corvette,
c seven corvette is a marvelous car.

664
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:55,350
It's a marvel of engineering.
It really is.

665
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:56,290
I mean,
it doesn't.

666
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,830
There's not a car under a half a million
dollars even compares to it,

667
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:05,460
you know,
when to get that zero six and they 

668
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:05,460
finally.
They are.

669
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:05,460
Let's do it.
Yeah.

670
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,070
They finally figured it out.
The seats are perfect.

671
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:09,230
Like everything's great in it.
Tanner's good drivers.

672
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,030
I just went,
man.

673
00:30:10,031 --> 00:30:12,280
Every time we would go out and do stuff 
and people would say like,

674
00:30:12,281 --> 00:30:14,400
why are you letting tanner beat you?
Just smiling,

675
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,840
talking.
I don't know if you noticed I was trying

676
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,690
my ass off.
I've actually not trying to let him beat

677
00:30:19,691 --> 00:30:24,691
me.
I think people don't truly understand 

678
00:30:24,691 --> 00:30:27,451
the amount of skill and knowledge that's
involved in driving a car like that or 

679
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:28,030
when he took that,
um,

680
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:33,120
the GT two around downtown La at nine,
it was that they closed down some 

681
00:30:33,311 --> 00:30:37,630
sections of downtown La and he had a 
really recent model,

682
00:30:37,631 --> 00:30:42,631
gt two,
which is just a stupendously fast car 

683
00:30:42,631 --> 00:30:46,010
and he was driving it during the day,
but it was too hot because it's turbo 

684
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:46,010
charged and it just didn't really help.

685
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,620
So she was getting crazy.
Yeah.

686
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:51,100
So he took it.
They mean it was pretty fast,

687
00:30:51,101 --> 00:30:52,160
I'm sure still.
Oh yeah.

688
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,870
But not fast enough and that's like his,
you know,

689
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,320
that's his dream car right there.
He's got a nine,

690
00:30:58,321 --> 00:30:59,680
nine,
six,

691
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,570
nine,
six turbo.

692
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,040
Yeah.
He bought it from.

693
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:08,070
Somebody had built it up.
It had like seven and change hundred 

694
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:10,360
horsepower at the wheels and the guy put
a really stiff clutch in their thought.

695
00:31:10,361 --> 00:31:11,920
He had ruined the car.
Tanner bought it,

696
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,650
drove it home from,
I think he got an Arizona Change,

697
00:31:15,651 --> 00:31:20,651
a clutch.
Took it and I think it's called bb buys 

698
00:31:20,651 --> 00:31:20,651
a place.
He took it and change a clutch,

699
00:31:20,651 --> 00:31:22,450
did a bunch of little tuning on it,
so it's six and change it.

700
00:31:22,451 --> 00:31:27,451
The wheels now and that sucker is so 
stupid fast and just absolute screamer 

701
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,400
will look how much better that looks.

702
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,850
Disgusting.
Magnus Walker.

703
00:31:30,851 --> 00:31:35,851
Paint job.
That's the same car you're looking at 

704
00:31:35,851 --> 00:31:39,061
the same car,
but that car looks bitching like some 

705
00:31:39,061 --> 00:31:40,150
freak carbon makes everything better.
The carbon fiber hoods.

706
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:42,190
Pretty wicked.
It's just,

707
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:44,530
it's an amazing car.
I had a gt,

708
00:31:44,531 --> 00:31:47,050
I'm a 19,
96 rather turbo,

709
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,720
just like his,
those same ones,

710
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:49,190
the nine,
nine,

711
00:31:49,191 --> 00:31:51,250
six turbo.
But mine was a hunk of Shit.

712
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,150
Mine broke down five times and almost 
queered me off of A.

713
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,870
I don't know if that's it.
Can you say about that?

714
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,730
I mean gay.
I was like,

715
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,080
ah.
It's too weird.

716
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:03,610
They just break too much.
I mean,

717
00:32:03,611 --> 00:32:07,510
queer as an odd.
I wouldn't say queer it off.

718
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:08,490
I don't even know.
I said that.

719
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,370
I think I've ever said that before,
but I'm just butter coffees.

720
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,510
What it is.
It's in my blood.

721
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,760
But um,
the,

722
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,610
the car broke down five times,
like catastrophic failures,

723
00:32:18,611 --> 00:32:21,400
like twice the shift,
linkage blue where the clutch,

724
00:32:21,401 --> 00:32:22,590
like I go to put in the clutch and I 
moved,

725
00:32:22,591 --> 00:32:27,591
move the gear and there's just nothing 
that the gear shifter just spinning 

726
00:32:27,591 --> 00:32:27,591
around in a circle,
nothing connected to it.

727
00:32:27,591 --> 00:32:31,420
One time it blew at a red light and a,
it stuck in second gear.

728
00:32:31,421 --> 00:32:34,660
So I just rubbed it really high and I 
pulled out in second gear.

729
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:38,890
I drove to the porsche dealership in 
second gear and that was the second time

730
00:32:38,891 --> 00:32:39,410
they,
it.

731
00:32:39,411 --> 00:32:40,280
So I was like,
what

732
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:42,140
the fuck?
What's happening?

733
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:45,410
Then they replace the engine once the 
engine.

734
00:32:45,411 --> 00:32:50,411
They didn't know what the fuck was.
It was making weird noises and like 

735
00:32:50,411 --> 00:32:50,411
we're going to replace the entire 
engine.

736
00:32:50,411 --> 00:32:51,410
Like okay,
great,

737
00:32:51,411 --> 00:32:52,610
good.
Whatever.

738
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:54,560
Fucking year old car replaced the 
engine,

739
00:32:54,561 --> 00:32:57,160
that's this whole thing to the ground.
And then they um,

740
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:00,800
then the gas gauge broke on the highway.
I had half a tank of gas,

741
00:33:00,801 --> 00:33:04,810
but I did not have a half tank.
And in the left lane on the [inaudible],

742
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:08,990
near the Hollywood bowl,
the motherfucker ran out of gas of man.

743
00:33:08,991 --> 00:33:10,940
That's the worst.
Yeah,

744
00:33:10,941 --> 00:33:15,941
it was his year.
There you are on the side of the road 

745
00:33:15,941 --> 00:33:15,941
and everyone knows you.
Huh?

746
00:33:15,941 --> 00:33:16,820
Well,
I can't tell you a little secret.

747
00:33:16,821 --> 00:33:21,821
There was a.
I saw a good looking food truck about 

748
00:33:21,821 --> 00:33:21,821
two minutes from here.
Yeah.

749
00:33:21,821 --> 00:33:22,700
Uh,
we're getting a little lunch for him.

750
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,120
I was like,
oh,

751
00:33:23,121 --> 00:33:28,121
it's swinging there.
And I caught just enough of the curb 

752
00:33:28,121 --> 00:33:28,220
with the tire that when the tire came 
off of it,

753
00:33:28,221 --> 00:33:30,380
the noise was so loud that I was like,
okay,

754
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,670
get back in.
Let's go.

755
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:35,960
We can stop here.
I bought a car from Toyota racing,

756
00:33:35,961 --> 00:33:38,390
loaned me Alexis RCF,
beautiful car.

757
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:43,450
I'm not getting out at that point 
because then I'm that guy who I just 

758
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:44,030
don't.
You just don't need more of that in your

759
00:33:44,031 --> 00:33:45,950
life.
Turns out cars don't.

760
00:33:45,951 --> 00:33:48,230
Especially if they're like,
you're that guy from top gear.

761
00:33:48,231 --> 00:33:50,250
Hey,
you just fucked up that car,

762
00:33:50,251 --> 00:33:51,650
man.
I saw you hit that curb.

763
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:53,630
What happened?
There's nothing you can do about it.

764
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,230
If you can hit a fucking curb every now 
and again,

765
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:02,380
here he is in downtown La,
going sideways around these regular 

766
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:05,120
streets that gt two,
so say in the tunnels,

767
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,220
you people don't appreciate it.

768
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:12,280
Like what it takes to drive like that.
They don't really have to know when to 

769
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:12,280
come in,
when to go out,

770
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:17,180
where the turn is when they hit the gas.
There's like so much knowledge and 

771
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:21,020
experience that goes into driving a car 
like that and the consequences or death.

772
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,360
There's not a lot of gray area.
Yeah.

773
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,510
This isn't a real game.
You're getting good at.

774
00:34:26,511 --> 00:34:29,300
You're driving a fucking 600 horsepower 
car.

775
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:31,790
The waist,
a little bit over 3000 pounds.

776
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,580
Have you ever gone in and either watched
her done any drifting?

777
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:36,070
No.
Oh my gosh.

778
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:41,080
You love the most.
It's just vehicular shenanigans in one 

779
00:34:41,241 --> 00:34:42,200
place.
Right.

780
00:34:42,201 --> 00:34:45,710
And that's why like I can trip but my 
transition suck.

781
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:46,560
Right.
Minefield.

782
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:49,220
Like I stole a car.
Where's tanner?

783
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:53,360
Like you could hold a cup of coffee and 
never move it because he's just so good.

784
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:54,260
Smooth me in.

785
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:58,700
It's like when they come down to long 
beach or Irwindale Fan,

786
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:01,190
I think that it's early and I was going 
to be a mall now or something.

787
00:35:01,191 --> 00:35:03,830
But yeah,
finally they,

788
00:35:03,831 --> 00:35:05,240
they,
they fought that for years.

789
00:35:05,241 --> 00:35:09,140
But watching what those guys in formula 
drift can do is.

790
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,690
I mean it's the stuff we did in parking 
lots in high school.

791
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:16,740
Right.
But now it's a sport and they're so 

792
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,941
good.
I did a lot of that in high school 

793
00:35:18,941 --> 00:35:18,941
because we had snow.
So yeah,

794
00:35:18,941 --> 00:35:20,840
are drifting with snow creative.
Like I learned how to drive from driving

795
00:35:20,841 --> 00:35:23,570
in snow because that's when the asset 
kicks out.

796
00:35:23,571 --> 00:35:26,420
It's like that's the skills you need.
It's really the same skills.

797
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:31,450
It's why we pray for snow in the south.
It snow like five times in my life and I

798
00:35:31,731 --> 00:35:33,720
bought some of the cars from top gear so
I don't know.

799
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:38,360
We built a four by four school bus was 
jacked up on 44 is with a snowplow.

800
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:41,220
I don't know if you ever saw it.
It had a flame thrower on the roof.

801
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:46,540
Well,
I knew they were going to crush it and 

802
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:46,540
cut it up because they couldn't sell it 
to the public.

803
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,420
Let me buy it.
I'll take it home.

804
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:53,660
Shifted home to Georgia.
So got it tagged taking my daughters to 

805
00:35:56,701 --> 00:35:59,340
school.
We drive it around for Halloween.

806
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:03,810
Do you really still has a snow plow on 
the front and as you can imagine like it

807
00:36:03,811 --> 00:36:06,300
snowed once and like the last 10 years 
in Georgia.

808
00:36:06,301 --> 00:36:11,301
And we made the news because everybody 
got on the interstate at the exact same 

809
00:36:11,301 --> 00:36:11,760
time.
So it melts the snow.

810
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:15,730
The fire blaster turns out there was a 
Celica under their toys.

811
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:18,500
So yeah,
we left a note.

812
00:36:18,501 --> 00:36:19,140
It will be fine.

813
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:21,540
It was in Maine.
That was in Caribou,

814
00:36:21,541 --> 00:36:23,390
Maine at the old,
uh,

815
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,900
the air force base.
It's right there.

816
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:30,540
So there's Canada is just on the other 
side of that shot and this is one of 

817
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,180
those places where,
um,

818
00:36:32,181 --> 00:36:37,181
I think they call it a minute men where 
you had to be able to get from like 

819
00:36:37,181 --> 00:36:40,530
where you were sleeping to an airplane 
in 60 seconds in case like Cold War.

820
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:47,240
Right?
So there's all these tunnels underneath 

821
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,090
where we were shooting and we had to 
have all sorts of clearance would be out

822
00:36:48,091 --> 00:36:49,230
there.
It was awesome.

823
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:54,410
Whoa.
And then I bought the bus much as they 

824
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:55,440
sold that to for a I,
I got,

825
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:58,830
I got a very good deal.
I got it costs more to ship at home.

826
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,590
It was a lot to ship it.
I'm not going to lie because you have to

827
00:37:01,591 --> 00:37:05,880
put on a low boy cause no truck that 
delivers cars can get through,

828
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:11,330
you know,
have like 13 or 14 clearance getting 

829
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:11,330
across the country.

830
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:12,740
So when it's already at like 12 feet.
Right.

831
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,900
You have kind of a problem.
Did you think about driving it for about

832
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:20,160
five seconds?
I mean 44 super show offers.

833
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:23,050
I can't imagine what the mileage would 
be like.

834
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:24,090
Two.
Yeah,

835
00:37:24,091 --> 00:37:28,110
two months ago and there's 197,000
miles on it.

836
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:33,230
And Tanner drove and didn't kill it.
It now says the magic school bus on the 

837
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:34,110
side.
I put a stereo in there.

838
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,600
It's really fun.
But we gassed it up,

839
00:37:36,601 --> 00:37:41,130
got it ready for it to snow in January.
And we didn't even get rain at my house.

840
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:44,190
It was just,
it's so defeating year,

841
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:46,350
dude.
Snow driving is.

842
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,980
I mean,
that's just some of the best out there.

843
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,880
Parking lots and snow.
That's what dreams are made up.

844
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:55,910
Yeah.
That's where I learned how to drive in 

845
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:55,910
snow in the parking lot.
It's just,

846
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:55,910
it's the best.

847
00:37:55,910 --> 00:38:00,350
Yeah.
Because it's so gentle the way you're 

848
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:00,350
going sideways.
It's like,

849
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:02,580
it doesn't feel like when you go in 
sideways on concrete,

850
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:04,840
it feels very violent.
Right?

851
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:08,550
On paved surfaces.
But if you go in the snow,

852
00:38:08,551 --> 00:38:13,551
it's like woo.
Wish I could remember a this girlfriend 

853
00:38:13,551 --> 00:38:13,760
that I had back in Boston,
um,

854
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:18,480
I took the car that I had to a parking 
lot once and for like an hour,

855
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,410
all we did was like gun it.
And then I'd slam on the e brake.

856
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:24,600
I turned the wheel and slam on the 
break.

857
00:38:24,601 --> 00:38:28,000
We'd spin around in circles.
We were just laughing and laughing.

858
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:30,510
It was fun.
And that's really,

859
00:38:30,511 --> 00:38:31,770
that's the car,
the car's fine.

860
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,710
That's basically drifting is because you
think about the beauty of your car takes

861
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,700
on concrete when you do that.
The other friction and everything that's

862
00:38:39,701 --> 00:38:44,701
rubbing but on snow and you just,
you just glad there are ice driving 

863
00:38:44,701 --> 00:38:44,701
schools.

864
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:47,740
Tamar,
todd [inaudible] in Colorado for years.

865
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:52,990
So again,
one of the reasons he's so good at what 

866
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:54,841
he does,
but it's basically like a little road 

867
00:38:54,841 --> 00:38:56,410
course they have and they wait for it to
snow and then they put a little water on

868
00:38:56,411 --> 00:39:01,411
it and ice it over and you take BMW's 
out there and learn how to handle a car 

869
00:39:01,411 --> 00:39:03,430
in the ice.
Like what a great idea is a great idea.

870
00:39:03,431 --> 00:39:05,760
And apparently it really translates.
Sure.

871
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:09,250
One of the things I w I almost got a 
motorcycle a long time ago,

872
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:14,460
but I saw a bunch of people crashed.
I saw two crashes and a friend of mine 

873
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:18,481
saw somebody get hit,
some guy who was at a red light and 

874
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:21,370
somebody was texting him this dude and 
he went flying through the air and I was

875
00:39:21,371 --> 00:39:21,970
like,
that's it.

876
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:24,250
Fuck that.
And my two friends that got hurt,

877
00:39:24,251 --> 00:39:25,240
they got hurt pretty bad.

878
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,270
Um,
but I was thinking about getting one.

879
00:39:28,271 --> 00:39:30,760
And my friend said,
who wrote all his life?

880
00:39:30,761 --> 00:39:32,020
He said,
get a dirt bike,

881
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:37,160
said,
get a dirt bike and learn how to drive 

882
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:37,660
in the dirt because when you,
when you have that loose surface,

883
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:42,900
you get used to the ass kicking out on 
you and it becomes normal because it's 

884
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:42,900
natural.
You don't panic.

885
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:48,570
So I think it's the same thing with snow
and ice and totally probably directly 

886
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:50,280
translates driving on the ice.
I think so because it's,

887
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,400
again,
it's all of that,

888
00:39:51,401 --> 00:39:53,160
you know,
it's the overseer,

889
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:58,180
the uninsured,
all of those things that you would feel 

890
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:00,390
in a smooth,
safe environment you would feel you 

891
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:00,390
would feel they're all.
He's drifting.

892
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:01,480
Yeah.
That's a,

893
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:06,020
that's a closely to each other.
That's Turk up front from the back.

894
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,250
Know who these people are.
Yeah.

895
00:40:07,251 --> 00:40:07,950
Dude,
I love this.

896
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:11,110
This is my mama right here.
This is my son.

897
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:13,480
So he's from.
He lives up in New Hampshire.

898
00:40:13,481 --> 00:40:16,720
Freddy's from Sweden I think,
but both of those cars.

899
00:40:16,721 --> 00:40:20,450
So those start out Frederick Houseboat,
that's a front wheel drive sign,

900
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:25,510
TC converted to rear wheel drive.
It's got a turbo four cylinder and 

901
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,010
they're Turks.
Car Is A.

902
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:29,470
has a turbo super swapping it gigantic 
turbo.

903
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:33,460
It's a a really seriously.
I just love it.

904
00:40:33,461 --> 00:40:35,440
It's just the most fun you can have in a
car,

905
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:38,260
but it's just going sideways.
It's basically these guys,

906
00:40:38,261 --> 00:40:40,090
what they do is they have these clipping
points,

907
00:40:40,091 --> 00:40:45,091
right,
and they try to get as close to the 

908
00:40:45,091 --> 00:40:45,400
clipping point is they can.
It has to do with their speed of entry,

909
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,350
the angle,
the car right,

910
00:40:47,351 --> 00:40:51,790
and they've got this huge e-brake that 
they've got the breaks or is big for the

911
00:40:51,791 --> 00:40:54,550
rear wheels as they are for the front 
because they've got a clutch,

912
00:40:54,551 --> 00:40:59,551
kick it pulling on a lever right block,
you know that can block Mustang video,

913
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:01,840
which is amazing.

914
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,810
That four wheel drive Mustang call that.
Yes,

915
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:07,750
the Hunington guys,
but that's a funny name for that.

916
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:12,810
The Unicorn a yes that that Mustang is 
such a bad memory jammer,

917
00:41:12,851 --> 00:41:16,570
but you know what?
What those guys do in that precision.

918
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:21,070
Look at that fucking thing.
It's so calm and so the e brake is a big

919
00:41:21,071 --> 00:41:24,550
part of being able to do that and right 
the way they bring the car around.

920
00:41:24,551 --> 00:41:29,551
So especially in drifting,
those guys have to get as close to each 

921
00:41:29,551 --> 00:41:29,950
others they can write while still 
keeping the line,

922
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:35,400
trying to get as close to these 
different like clipping points as they 

923
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:35,400
can.
So he's slamming on the e brake,

924
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:39,701
right to make these turns and the way 
these guys have to to use the clutch at 

925
00:41:40,821 --> 00:41:45,821
the same time they're using the e brake 
to get it to slide without killing 

926
00:41:45,821 --> 00:41:45,821
everything.

927
00:41:45,821 --> 00:41:48,290
And then they get back on a guy like 
Vaughn gitten jr who drifts a Mustang.

928
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:53,440
He is full throttle the whole time in 
module eight just with the clutch.

929
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,510
And that's like next level stuff that I 
can't.

930
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,810
I can only do seven things at one time.
I can't have a 12th.

931
00:41:59,811 --> 00:42:03,410
So one watching him go out there.
Tanner has A.

932
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:05,450
Tamar,
took a VW Passat,

933
00:42:05,451 --> 00:42:09,750
convert it's rear wheel drive and use 
that ls seven from zero six.

934
00:42:09,751 --> 00:42:11,330
It's no,
it's basically like the Chevy,

935
00:42:11,331 --> 00:42:12,690
a cookbook,
American Jewry,

936
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:17,190
and then they tune.
He's gotten nine nine to the wheels that

937
00:42:17,191 --> 00:42:19,700
the chambers newpark wait a minute.
Nine the wheels.

938
00:42:19,701 --> 00:42:22,970
And what kind of car is.
It looks like a Volkswagen Passat,

939
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:28,490
so on the outside it's a fucking shitty 
Volkswagen community car in the inside 

940
00:42:28,761 --> 00:42:33,761
it has 900 horsepower to the wheels.
It's bad ass.

941
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:37,220
The most ridiculous thing I've ever 
heard in my life.

942
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:40,730
I just wish Volkswagen would build 
something like a little bit like that.

943
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:43,220
It would make them much cooler.
Now let me ask you this.

944
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:48,230
[inaudible] Mustang.
People are so weird that that can block 

945
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:48,560
video.
What did they think about that car?

946
00:42:48,561 --> 00:42:52,760
Because he took,
was it 65 or 65 or 66 and they basically

947
00:42:52,761 --> 00:42:57,761
had to stretch it and make it kind of 
fit and they turn into a four wheel 

948
00:42:57,761 --> 00:42:59,060
drive.
Did everybody freak out?

949
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:04,100
They lose the fucking power.
That car made the cover a hot rod 

950
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:08,291
magazine,
so it transcended like people like me 

951
00:43:08,291 --> 00:43:09,980
that love import cars and in horsepower 
it was like,

952
00:43:09,981 --> 00:43:10,820
no,
this,

953
00:43:10,821 --> 00:43:13,220
I'm just going to trump everyone with 
this ridiculous car.

954
00:43:13,221 --> 00:43:17,090
So I think that's one of those ones that
can also can kind of get away with stuff

955
00:43:17,091 --> 00:43:20,750
like that because he's Ken can block and
he kinda just like,

956
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:21,830
you have to dig that.

957
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:25,400
He can do what he wants to do because he
made it work.

958
00:43:25,401 --> 00:43:26,090
But yeah,
that's,

959
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:31,120
that's tanner sought what a ridiculous 
human being 900 Horsepower v eight 

960
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:36,630
Volkswagen bug sot that's an ela.
So.

961
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:38,060
So He's,
he's a,

962
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:43,010
he's racing in Daytona this weekend.
He does that global rally cross series,

963
00:43:43,011 --> 00:43:48,011
which is a lot of funds basically him 
and Ken Block and about 10 other people 

964
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:53,710
wrecking the crap out of each other.
There's not a single person out there 

965
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:54,950
that knows how to pass besides tanner 
that gets them.

966
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,470
It's really fun to watch,
but it's just,

967
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:03,120
it's insanity.
These cars are so I just don't 

968
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:06,461
understand why.
Like why would you do that to an ugly 

969
00:44:06,461 --> 00:44:06,461
car?
Like,

970
00:44:06,461 --> 00:44:08,810
I mean why wouldn't he do that to a car 
that's like a really cool car.

971
00:44:08,811 --> 00:44:13,811
Like why do this?
He's sponsored by sponsored by 

972
00:44:13,811 --> 00:44:16,541
Volkswagen.
So he races their stuff in GRC and then 

973
00:44:16,541 --> 00:44:17,930
did some world rallycross stuff with 
him.

974
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:21,020
But the coolest part is that he 
convinced them to let him do it.

975
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,610
Like that's what I love.
Yeah.

976
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:25,100
Because I have.
So I have a scion xb at home,

977
00:44:25,101 --> 00:44:28,280
like the little box that the same people
that built that car.

978
00:44:28,281 --> 00:44:32,190
Papadakis racing built this one and my 
Johan used to own it.

979
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:37,250
It's converted a rear wheel drive.
The back of the car thinks it's a mark 

980
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:37,800
for supra,
like complete sub frame,

981
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:43,070
just like the car.
And then it has a two jz super swap in 

982
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:45,480
there with a six speed.
And Yo had a line lock put in.

983
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:46,950
If you look up,
uh,

984
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:50,580
if you look up Dta Xb,
you would find that.

985
00:44:50,581 --> 00:44:54,630
But papadakis racing Stefan postdoc 
right away.

986
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:57,570
Super Guy like coolest nerd you'll ever 
meet.

987
00:44:57,630 --> 00:44:58,480
He's like the,
just,

988
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,570
he's like the doctor,
you know,

989
00:45:00,571 --> 00:45:04,980
he's like the mad scientist up there,
but this has a line lock so you can step

990
00:45:04,981 --> 00:45:07,530
on the brakes and hold the button and it
holds the front brakes.

991
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:09,180
Right?
So then you rev it up,

992
00:45:09,181 --> 00:45:10,740
drop the clutch.
And it's a smoke show.

993
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:14,700
Adam have cy on that.
Looks like a front wheel drive car.

994
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:19,470
That's hilarious.
That's really fun stuff out there.

995
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:22,560
If you make it to Atlanta,
you got to come drive it.

996
00:45:22,561 --> 00:45:23,910
It's really fun.
I get it.

997
00:45:23,911 --> 00:45:26,970
But the cars are ugly.
That's what I don't understand.

998
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:32,150
Taking these ugly cars and turn them 
into these amazing driving vehicles like

999
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:37,610
wouldn't you want to invest that same 
amount of energy and is something that 

1000
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,180
looks great now?
Well that's a fair point.

1001
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:41,440
I hadn't really thought about it from 
that.

1002
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:45,510
For me,
when I saw this car I in and I was like,

1003
00:45:45,511 --> 00:45:47,490
oh well that's,
that's it.

1004
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,350
Because for me,
I've got three daughters,

1005
00:45:49,351 --> 00:45:50,310
right?
So I can't,

1006
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:53,700
like I can't have [inaudible] because 
that's a date night card.

1007
00:45:53,810 --> 00:45:56,000
Right.
Beyond that I can't afford one.

1008
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:57,690
But let's pretend for a second I could 
afford it.

1009
00:45:57,691 --> 00:46:02,691
And I love it.
I still can't have one because I just 

1010
00:46:02,691 --> 00:46:02,691
don't need just a car for me and my 
wife.

1011
00:46:02,691 --> 00:46:04,020
Like I want my girls to be able to come 
with me.

1012
00:46:04,021 --> 00:46:06,270
So that's Cya.
They can ride with me.

1013
00:46:06,271 --> 00:46:10,970
I can have three car seats in there.
God go thousand miles there.

1014
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:14,310
They're tiny bit embarrassed by it 
because it's really.

1015
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:19,370
It sounds great.
It had magnaflow do nice custom exhaust 

1016
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:19,370
when I was here.
Right.

1017
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:21,090
It's got a great growl to it,
but when the boost starts to build,

1018
00:46:21,091 --> 00:46:23,400
it's got this huge single turbo.
I mean it's.

1019
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:28,430
It'll pay you back in your sheets for I 
think it's like four 25 to the rear 

1020
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:30,600
wheels and a car's very light,
maybe 3000 pounds.

1021
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:34,980
They cut a lot of stuff out.
Things safety wise,

1022
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:40,710
the best fucking bread,
but it's a lunchbox drove around a 

1023
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:43,521
lunchbox with wheels,
but it's got air conditioning because I 

1024
00:46:43,521 --> 00:46:44,940
wanted my wife to ride in it with me.

1025
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:47,640
So when a bought it out here,
I took it to my friends at tr,

1026
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:48,660
Dionne Hill,
the Guy Chuck.

1027
00:46:48,661 --> 00:46:49,680
I said,
can you see,

1028
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:55,180
okay,
it looks like there's a vintage vintage 

1029
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:55,180
era as this company that makes like old 
hot rod kits.

1030
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:57,720
Right?
So there was a control panel for vintage

1031
00:46:57,721 --> 00:46:58,830
air thing in there.
And I said,

1032
00:46:58,831 --> 00:47:01,110
can you check and see like if we could 
make it.

1033
00:47:01,111 --> 00:47:02,190
And have air conditioning.
He looked,

1034
00:47:02,191 --> 00:47:02,610
he's like,
yeah,

1035
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:05,630
just going to bolt up a supra ac 
compressor and charge it.

1036
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:09,690
You'll be fine for 20 horse at four,
25 horsepower.

1037
00:47:09,691 --> 00:47:13,440
The thing that looks like insane,
like vintage air.

1038
00:47:13,441 --> 00:47:17,400
So important because they made those old
hot rods livable because if you drove in

1039
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:19,920
one of those old hot rods,
most of them didn't have any AC.

1040
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:21,450
And if they did,
it was a joke.

1041
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:22,500
Yeah,
it was not.

1042
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:25,860
It was like the swamp cooler of what you
put underneath.

1043
00:47:25,861 --> 00:47:28,050
But my wife will actually ride in stuff 
with me.

1044
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,610
That makes a big difference as you 
understand.

1045
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:32,130
I do understand that.
Makes.

1046
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:37,140
That definitely makes a big difference.
What were you doing before you were 

1047
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:39,460
hosting top gear?
So they found me and found you.

1048
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:42,280
I felt like I would say so I was uh,
you know,

1049
00:47:42,281 --> 00:47:44,950
when a man and a woman,
when they find each other,

1050
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:46,540
they found me,
believe it or not,

1051
00:47:46,541 --> 00:47:47,770
from,
from Youtube,

1052
00:47:47,771 --> 00:47:52,771
from a clip that somebody had loaded up 
that I was traveling with a the speed 

1053
00:47:52,771 --> 00:47:53,830
channel.
I started with them in,

1054
00:47:53,831 --> 00:47:55,870
Oh,
five from a craigslist ad.

1055
00:47:56,830 --> 00:47:58,870
Love craigslist,
I'm,

1056
00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:01,570
I'm the number one craigslist fan.
Uh,

1057
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:04,600
I found this add on there that just 
national motorsports company was looking

1058
00:48:04,601 --> 00:48:06,400
for a marketing guy that could be an MC.

1059
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,240
And so I sent all my stuff in and it was
one of those terrible interviews.

1060
00:48:10,241 --> 00:48:12,250
I'm not going to get this job.
And then two weeks later like,

1061
00:48:12,251 --> 00:48:13,750
hey,
go down to Daytona.

1062
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:17,290
So you got the Gig.
So I go down to Daytona and I,

1063
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:19,900
I like kind of knew a little bit about 
Nascar,

1064
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:25,070
you know,
knew Petey and Wallace Earnhardt I know 

1065
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:25,930
much else besides that.
Went to school for marketing.

1066
00:48:25,931 --> 00:48:27,910
So all of a sudden I want to be around 
cars.

1067
00:48:27,911 --> 00:48:32,410
That was always my plan.
So it started as a Dj for this big speed

1068
00:48:32,411 --> 00:48:33,730
stage.
It would go to all the races.

1069
00:48:33,731 --> 00:48:35,800
So I was out here at Fontana twice a 
year.

1070
00:48:35,801 --> 00:48:40,801
I said all the other races and that I 
kept begging him to let me do something 

1071
00:48:40,801 --> 00:48:42,220
on TV.
And they finally let me a year later.

1072
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:44,500
And then I think a year after that,
oh,

1073
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:45,790
seven,
uh,

1074
00:48:45,791 --> 00:48:50,560
John Schneider from the Dukes of hazzard
came to Atlanta Motor speedway to be the

1075
00:48:50,561 --> 00:48:51,250
Grand Marshall.

1076
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:51,820
And they said,
hey,

1077
00:48:51,821 --> 00:48:54,100
would you do this little piece with this
guy?

1078
00:48:54,101 --> 00:48:56,410
Um,
he does kind of lighter side of racing.

1079
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:57,580
Yeah,
just do something.

1080
00:48:57,581 --> 00:49:02,581
We found a general lead to borrow and we
shot this whole piece riding around in 

1081
00:49:02,581 --> 00:49:03,940
the generally in the whole time I refuse
to call him John.

1082
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:08,020
I would only refer to him as Bo.
And I kept being like,

1083
00:49:08,021 --> 00:49:11,470
so Bo,
I'm daisy is not your real cousin.

1084
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:13,790
Right?
He was like,

1085
00:49:13,791 --> 00:49:14,350
no,
that's a,

1086
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:16,170
that's an actress Katherine Bach.
Like,

1087
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:17,750
but so like,
if she was not your real cousin,

1088
00:49:17,751 --> 00:49:19,480
like you guys ever,
you know,

1089
00:49:19,481 --> 00:49:24,481
go to dinner or see a movie or.
And so he starts out,

1090
00:49:25,641 --> 00:49:26,260
he's like,
yeah,

1091
00:49:26,261 --> 00:49:27,970
we're good friends.
Really enjoyed it.

1092
00:49:27,971 --> 00:49:32,971
And so some a race fan who,
I don't know who loaded that clip onto 

1093
00:49:32,971 --> 00:49:35,320
youtube illegally,
this Guy John Heseltine,

1094
00:49:35,321 --> 00:49:38,410
who is our executive producer,
saw it in A.

1095
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:40,750
I don't know if he was here still in the
UK at that point.

1096
00:49:40,751 --> 00:49:42,460
And he was like,
this kid might be funny.

1097
00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:47,610
He was looking at everybody who had been
on TV for cars and like the last 10 

1098
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:47,610
years.
And so this re,

1099
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:52,050
the craziest part about my life is that 
this person who I don't know who loaded 

1100
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:56,731
this video up is the person that like I 
feel like is the reason I got to talk 

1101
00:49:56,731 --> 00:49:56,731
here.
Because you ever find that person?

1102
00:49:56,731 --> 00:49:58,180
No,
I don't know who it is because the video

1103
00:49:58,181 --> 00:50:00,130
got kicked off because it was 
copywritten.

1104
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:05,310
Well,
I guarantee you that person is going to 

1105
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:07,921
find out that they got you.
That somehow through the grapevine I 

1106
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:12,130
want to take them to a race.
I want to say I don't want to do 

1107
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:12,130
something.
Like I didn't have an agent.

1108
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:15,030
I was in the phone book like I was just 
a kid trying to hustle and try to figure

1109
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,120
out how am I going to make this TV thing
works.

1110
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:18,880
Great Story.
Thanks man.

1111
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:20,940
That's amazing.
I love craigslist.

1112
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:22,270
Yeah,
I guess you should.

1113
00:50:22,330 --> 00:50:23,280
They.
That's what I mean.

1114
00:50:23,281 --> 00:50:28,281
It's a little.
Craigslist is like a little bit filthy 

1115
00:50:28,281 --> 00:50:28,281
dirty,
but human beings

1116
00:50:28,281 --> 00:50:31,510
all about where everything's.
Everything's got a little bit turns on.

1117
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,130
It brings us a little bit of poop.
This is a little bit.

1118
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:34,820
Yeah.
Well,

1119
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:37,010
there's a lot of weird,
you know,

1120
00:50:37,011 --> 00:50:40,700
men seeking women seeking men seeking,
seeking,

1121
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:43,400
seeking that out will be honest.
That.

1122
00:50:43,401 --> 00:50:44,140
What is it,
um,

1123
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:46,640
missed connections.
What's that?

1124
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:49,070
That is this section of craigslist where
it's like,

1125
00:50:49,071 --> 00:50:51,200
Hey,
saw you in the coffee shop.

1126
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:56,260
You ordered the Latte.
I had the muffin that some of the best 

1127
00:50:56,260 --> 00:51:00,370
reading.
If you're bored or if you're a person 

1128
00:51:00,370 --> 00:51:00,370
that reads a lot when you're taking a 
dump,

1129
00:51:00,370 --> 00:51:01,460
that's,
that is joy.

1130
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:06,720
It's like people who've seen too many 
tom hanks movies and believe that they 

1131
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,380
just missed out on the one they saw her 
older,

1132
00:51:09,381 --> 00:51:12,770
that pumpkin spice lattes,
pumpkin spice lattes.

1133
00:51:12,771 --> 00:51:15,020
I knew it was her and I just,
I didn't have the courage,

1134
00:51:15,021 --> 00:51:17,040
but now I do and I need a finer.

1135
00:51:17,790 --> 00:51:22,790
You honestly,
you're going to have to look at these 

1136
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:24,881
because some of them are so we forget 
that because you probably don't spend 

1137
00:51:24,881 --> 00:51:26,180
time with like my friends are just 
pretty normal people.

1138
00:51:26,181 --> 00:51:31,181
I don't spend time with people that are 
genuinely just out of their mind crazy 

1139
00:51:31,181 --> 00:51:33,140
and that's an entire section for those 
people.

1140
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:38,230
We had a guy like that on fear factor 
once and he met a girl at a cod,

1141
00:51:38,651 --> 00:51:43,651
believe it was at a concert and spoke to
her briefly and wanted to win fear 

1142
00:51:44,030 --> 00:51:49,030
factor because he knew that she was the 
one and he needed to find her again and 

1143
00:51:50,151 --> 00:51:55,151
he'd spent some insane amount of time 
and money going around the city and 

1144
00:51:55,581 --> 00:52:00,581
where he met her putting up flyers and 
say put up all these flyers and you 

1145
00:52:00,581 --> 00:52:01,160
know,
all those people that contacted him that

1146
00:52:01,161 --> 00:52:02,150
weren't,
that girl,

1147
00:52:02,151 --> 00:52:03,950
you know,
that were fucking with him.

1148
00:52:03,951 --> 00:52:08,951
And he was like super determined.
But he had done it for like a couple of 

1149
00:52:08,951 --> 00:52:12,830
years and they thought it was funny when
we first talked about having this guy on

1150
00:52:12,831 --> 00:52:14,140
the show.
Like he's got a great story.

1151
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:19,190
Good story.
So I heard the story I go to imagine 

1152
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:19,550
that was your fucking sister.
Imagine if that was your daughter.

1153
00:52:19,551 --> 00:52:22,280
I imagine that was your girlfriend.
That's not a great story.

1154
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:29,500
He's nuts and you know,
who knows like where he's going to take 

1155
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:29,500
it.
Right.

1156
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:29,930
You know,
who knows if he's murder,

1157
00:52:29,931 --> 00:52:31,190
suicidal,
you know,

1158
00:52:31,191 --> 00:52:32,390
it's in.
What if she just.

1159
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:33,710
What if he said to her like,
Hey,

1160
00:52:33,711 --> 00:52:35,090
can I get a Napkin?
Sure.

1161
00:52:35,350 --> 00:52:39,110
What if that was the entire conversation
was a very brief conversation.

1162
00:52:39,111 --> 00:52:41,990
I forget the nature of the conversation,
but it was extremely brief,

1163
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:45,620
but I remember being really creeped out 
by him really creeped out.

1164
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:48,480
Like when we had him on the show,
because there was a lot,

1165
00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:53,910
there was a lot of decision making that 
went into getting on those shows that I 

1166
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:57,401
didn't agree with.
A lot of people made it onto the show 

1167
00:52:57,401 --> 00:52:57,401
that I was like,
fucking really,

1168
00:52:57,401 --> 00:52:58,760
you want to put this guy on tv?
Are you out of your mind?

1169
00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:03,910
This is a crazy person.
Like there was a guy that I almost got 

1170
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:07,661
into a fist fight with,
like I had to restrain him and it was 

1171
00:53:07,661 --> 00:53:07,661
the same thing.

1172
00:53:07,661 --> 00:53:10,310
It was a guy he beat his girlfriend up 
on one one TV show.

1173
00:53:10,311 --> 00:53:15,311
He threw her to the ground on a TV show 
and attack some fucking guy on vh one 

1174
00:53:15,311 --> 00:53:17,600
and then got in my face and I was like,
Jesus fucking Christ.

1175
00:53:17,830 --> 00:53:22,830
And I said to them like,
why are you putting these crazy fucks 

1176
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:22,830
that,
you know,

1177
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:23,360
are crazy Fox on TV?
Like,

1178
00:53:23,361 --> 00:53:25,220
do you understand that this is like,
you're responsible,

1179
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:28,410
this is not a smart thing to do.
What did the producers say to that?

1180
00:53:29,090 --> 00:53:30,610
Um,
they didn't give a fuck,

1181
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:32,040
right?
They're trying to,

1182
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:34,860
they're trying to make money and the way
to make money is to have crazy people on

1183
00:53:34,861 --> 00:53:36,200
tv and that's it.
You know,

1184
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:39,470
in my point of view was like,
I had hosted,

1185
00:53:39,810 --> 00:53:44,810
you know,
and these people were kind of dangerous 

1186
00:53:44,810 --> 00:53:47,001
and you know,
you're on rooftops with him and shit in 

1187
00:53:47,001 --> 00:53:47,250
downtown La.
So that's a 30 fucking stories,

1188
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:47,690
right?

1189
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:50,790
There's a lot of weird shit that could 
happen on those rooftops,

1190
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:52,370
you know,
someone could push somebody,

1191
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:57,380
somebody could jump,
and we had some like really nutty fucks 

1192
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:59,370
that made it on that show,
but that guy that got the guy almost got

1193
00:53:59,371 --> 00:54:04,371
in a fight with that guy that was trying
to find that girl they stood out like 

1194
00:54:04,411 --> 00:54:09,411
cheese is Christ because I looked in his
eyes while I was talking to them and 

1195
00:54:09,411 --> 00:54:13,620
there was nobody there.
It was just this missed of consciousness

1196
00:54:13,621 --> 00:54:18,621
who's like a child in a man's body who 
thought he was in a movie and thought,

1197
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:21,010
you know,
that he's just gonna keep going until he

1198
00:54:21,011 --> 00:54:23,670
finds the ratio and as the show went on,
you know,

1199
00:54:23,671 --> 00:54:25,410
a couple of days in and hanging out with
this guy,

1200
00:54:25,411 --> 00:54:28,950
you got deeper and deeper into who he 
really is and he's creepier and creepier

1201
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,720
and weirder and weirder.

1202
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,670
And then even the producers,
by the third day it was like,

1203
00:54:32,671 --> 00:54:34,440
we made a mistake.
We shouldn't have this guy on the show.

1204
00:54:35,270 --> 00:54:40,270
We're like,
we only hope that it doesn't ever right 

1205
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:40,270
by bad.
We only hope we never find that girl,

1206
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:41,630
you know,
can I,

1207
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:43,410
can I ask,
because I was such a big fan.

1208
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,700
What,
what was Newsradio lack?

1209
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:48,750
Because when I watched that show and 
saw,

1210
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:53,780
I mean,
what an amazing group of people you got 

1211
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:54,510
to work with like that.
When you look back on that time,

1212
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:59,980
like how does that rank?
Because you've done some really cool 

1213
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:00,000
stuff.
Turns out for sure.

1214
00:55:00,001 --> 00:55:05,001
It,
it fucked me up at queered me off of 

1215
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:05,120
sitcoms forever.
Really?

1216
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:10,600
I never do another [inaudible] because 
it will never be that good because it 

1217
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:12,390
was so.
It was just so lucky and I had gotten to

1218
00:55:12,391 --> 00:55:15,480
do a show before that for Fox.

1219
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:20,480
That was terrible.
It was called hardballs a baseball set 

1220
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:20,480
comp.
Okay.

1221
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:24,360
And it wasn't hard.
It wasn't horrible because of the 

1222
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:26,121
creators.
It was one of those situations were 

1223
00:55:26,121 --> 00:55:28,161
really funny.
Guys who wrote with married with 

1224
00:55:28,161 --> 00:55:28,161
children,
they wrote off for the simpsons.

1225
00:55:28,161 --> 00:55:30,720
They created a show and then the show 
became,

1226
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:36,320
once it went on television,
they took it away from them and then 

1227
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:36,320
they brought in some hacks and it just 
became.

1228
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:41,120
It was grow,
so that got canceled really quick 

1229
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:41,220
because I went from that to news radio,
which was the total opposite.

1230
00:55:41,221 --> 00:55:43,200
Sure.
The guy running the show at genius,

1231
00:55:43,201 --> 00:55:48,201
the writers were fantastic that the 
scripts were insanely funny and the 

1232
00:55:48,201 --> 00:55:50,460
people were so talented and I had no 
acting experience.

1233
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:54,000
I had taken a few acting lessons because
they forced me into taking it.

1234
00:55:54,001 --> 00:55:55,530
When the game me this big development 
deal,

1235
00:55:55,570 --> 00:55:55,890
no way.

1236
00:55:55,910 --> 00:56:00,910
It was all based on stand up and all of 
a sudden the mountain Hollywood and I'm 

1237
00:56:00,910 --> 00:56:04,641
totally feel like a fraud.
I totally feel like I don't belong and 

1238
00:56:04,641 --> 00:56:05,520
I'm on the greatest outcome of all time.
It was.

1239
00:56:05,521 --> 00:56:06,750
It was madness,
but it was.

1240
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:11,810
It was one of the greatest things about 
it was that it never got any 

1241
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:12,150
recognition,
so no one ever got a big head because it

1242
00:56:12,151 --> 00:56:13,560
never.
No one ever got famous from it.

1243
00:56:13,561 --> 00:56:18,561
It was just.
We barely survived every year and the 

1244
00:56:18,561 --> 00:56:22,041
one year that I thought that we weren't 
going to get canceled was the year we 

1245
00:56:22,041 --> 00:56:23,010
got canceled because it was.
I was like,

1246
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:24,940
well,
they didn't cancel us after Phil Hartman

1247
00:56:24,941 --> 00:56:25,780
got murdered.
Right.

1248
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,300
We're probably not going to get 
canceled.

1249
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:29,710
Right.
But then it just didn't work.

1250
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:32,590
It just didn't work with Jon Lovitz.
It's not that it does love,

1251
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:33,540
it isn't funny.
It's just,

1252
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:35,470
it was,
it was fucked.

1253
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:37,210
It was just,
he was dead.

1254
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,340
It was the whole thing was just,
you know,

1255
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:44,970
even though there was andy,
Dick was still on the show and Vicky 

1256
00:56:44,970 --> 00:56:46,430
Lewis and Maura tierney was still 
amazing and Dave Foley is still.

1257
00:56:46,431 --> 00:56:51,431
It was like having filled dead was 
always going to be a part of what was 

1258
00:56:52,270 --> 00:56:53,950
wrong.
It just didn't work.

1259
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:55,010
It was just,
it was

1260
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:56,880
time was such a,
you know,

1261
00:56:57,110 --> 00:56:58,530
it was,
um,

1262
00:56:59,270 --> 00:57:04,270
it was,
it really interesting landscape for tv 

1263
00:57:04,270 --> 00:57:04,270
because there weren't a ton.
There's also like,

1264
00:57:04,270 --> 00:57:08,261
if we look back at that time,
I don't remember a lot of other shows 

1265
00:57:08,261 --> 00:57:10,941
that I really liked and could sit there 
because it was such a good ensemble of 

1266
00:57:10,941 --> 00:57:12,120
so many people that brought different 
things.

1267
00:57:12,121 --> 00:57:17,121
Whereas normally there's like there's 
Alpha male and then there's two other 

1268
00:57:17,121 --> 00:57:20,451
sort of people.
I felt like that was a fantastic mix of 

1269
00:57:20,451 --> 00:57:20,820
people.
It was a group.

1270
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:22,080
It was a very weird.

1271
00:57:22,470 --> 00:57:26,490
None of us were all outliers.
We're all Weirdos.

1272
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:29,490
Like even phil was a Weirdo de 
[inaudible],

1273
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:34,540
as weird as it gets.
Dick's the weirdest human that's ever 

1274
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:34,540
walked the face of the planet.
I was weird.

1275
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:35,880
I didn't belong.
No one belonged.

1276
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:40,940
You know,
we all had some weird bond because of 

1277
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:43,140
that though.
We all felt like we didn't fit in.

1278
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:46,020
And so like when we would do,
like we'd have guests stars,

1279
00:57:46,021 --> 00:57:47,790
it would be like real actors.
We'd be like,

1280
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:52,910
what's this methodology that he's doing?
We would have guest stars and they would

1281
00:57:52,911 --> 00:57:57,240
like talk after talk like industry talk,
just a way that actors talk.

1282
00:57:57,270 --> 00:57:58,890
They pick up this,
uh,

1283
00:57:58,891 --> 00:58:03,891
this sort of acquired vernacular.
And one of the things that I say when 

1284
00:58:03,891 --> 00:58:03,891
they meet someone,
they say,

1285
00:58:03,891 --> 00:58:04,410
Hey,
nice to meet Ya.

1286
00:58:04,411 --> 00:58:06,660
Like you did.
And I do normal stuff.

1287
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:11,690
They say,
good to see you because they're hoping 

1288
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:14,960
that they didn't meet you and forget you
because they don't give a fuck about 

1289
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:14,960
you.

1290
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,750
There are so constantly they're 
concentrating on themselves wholly and 

1291
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:19,620
exclusively,
so to mitigate that,

1292
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:21,570
what they do is they say,
good to see you,

1293
00:58:21,610 --> 00:58:24,090
and so it becomes this thing that they 
all say.

1294
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:26,850
So when you meet someone they say,
good to see you and they're an actor,

1295
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:31,970
fucking run.
They've adopted this actor think shirts 

1296
00:58:32,221 --> 00:58:35,310
and they would read like the,
what I would call the devil's rag,

1297
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:38,430
like the Hollywood reporter.
They would read that shit and get angry.

1298
00:58:38,431 --> 00:58:40,140
God,
how does he have a show?

1299
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:41,130
God,
how does she have a show?

1300
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:46,280
And they like that shit would happen.
Like when we have guest stars that we 

1301
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:49,500
would like.
So it was a weird combination of a bunch

1302
00:58:49,501 --> 00:58:52,110
of people that were just Weirdos.
They were just,

1303
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:55,630
they didn't,
they didn't fit the mold of standard sit

1304
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:59,970
calm and no one went on to do a sitcom 
since none of them.

1305
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:02,280
I didn't think about that.
No one did.

1306
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:05,310
I'm Vicky did one for a little bit that 
didn't work out.

1307
00:59:05,550 --> 00:59:10,550
I'm Stephen Root,
went on to do amazing work and office 

1308
00:59:10,550 --> 00:59:13,971
space and he was in um,
he was fantastic in that fucking hbo.

1309
00:59:14,071 --> 00:59:14,910
What does that,
uh,

1310
00:59:15,330 --> 00:59:20,330
the uh,
Hbo Documentary of the HBO show.

1311
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,410
What the fuck is his show with,
um,

1312
00:59:22,790 --> 00:59:25,460
about liquor,
about bootleg liquor sales.

1313
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:26,860
Boardwalk Empire.
Yeah,

1314
00:59:26,870 --> 00:59:28,940
boardwalk empire.
He was amazing in that.

1315
00:59:28,941 --> 00:59:30,800
I mean,
he's just a fucking brilliant actor.

1316
00:59:30,801 --> 00:59:34,250
He was the one guy that wasn't himself 
on the show to like,

1317
00:59:34,430 --> 00:59:39,430
like what they would do is they take the
wackiest shit about like Andy and 

1318
00:59:39,430 --> 00:59:40,920
exaggerated wackiest shit about me and 
exaggerated.

1319
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:43,790
But Stephen Root,
like if you met him,

1320
00:59:43,791 --> 00:59:48,791
he's nothing like Jimmy James.
Jimmy James says this wacky character 

1321
00:59:48,791 --> 00:59:50,720
that he developed,
but he's just a brilliant,

1322
00:59:50,721 --> 00:59:52,760
brilliant actor,
you know,

1323
00:59:52,850 --> 00:59:54,260
just to the bone.

1324
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:59,320
I was listening to you one day and you 
were talking about the difference and I 

1325
00:59:59,320 --> 00:59:59,320
can't,
I'm sorry,

1326
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:01,250
I can't remember if it was stand up that
I was watching you or or the podcast,

1327
01:00:01,251 --> 01:00:06,251
but you're talking about the difference 
between a comedians and actors and how 

1328
01:00:06,251 --> 01:00:10,961
essentially the actors have to get up 
every day and pretend to be someone 

1329
01:00:10,961 --> 01:00:10,961
else.
I never really like.

1330
01:00:10,961 --> 01:00:13,490
They don't know who they are.
Whereas comedians like know who they are

1331
01:00:13,491 --> 01:00:14,840
and they.
That's what they talk about,

1332
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:19,420
but even in my limited experience in 
that town I don't like.

1333
01:00:19,421 --> 01:00:24,421
I don't really like it.
I don't ever have to wake up and wonder 

1334
01:00:24,421 --> 01:00:26,261
who to be.
I can't imagine what that's truly liked 

1335
01:00:26,261 --> 01:00:29,191
to to dive into someone so much that you
essentially get paid to lose yourself 

1336
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:32,310
each time and then you have to move on 
and do it again.

1337
01:00:32,310 --> 01:00:35,510
Like that's a lot harder.
Will think that Steven Brute,

1338
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:40,520
who's the one guy who did that on the 
show is he doesn't have any problems 

1339
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:41,080
knowing who he is.
He's a really nice guy.

1340
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:43,970
Super easy to like.
You get to know him.

1341
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:49,240
He's like very warm and friendly,
easy going guy and he just loves the 

1342
01:00:49,551 --> 01:00:54,551
craft of creating a character like it's.
He has the most pure intention other 

1343
01:00:55,571 --> 01:00:58,160
than any actor person I've ever met,
like his,

1344
01:00:58,190 --> 01:01:03,190
his love is really of creating,
you know that Steve Buscemi character 

1345
01:01:03,190 --> 01:01:05,090
that you remember from that movie that 
you know,

1346
01:01:05,091 --> 01:01:08,300
that Russell Crowe character,
they like fucking nailed it,

1347
01:01:08,301 --> 01:01:08,800
you know,
like that.

1348
01:01:09,050 --> 01:01:14,050
He just loves nailing a character.
He's just a master actor.

1349
01:01:14,151 --> 01:01:19,151
He's just a master at that and there's a
difference between those people and the 

1350
01:01:19,151 --> 01:01:22,010
people that just want to be famous and 
they want to be famous as an actor.

1351
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:27,220
So there's,
there's a lot of weirdness in that 

1352
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:27,220
craft.
There's a,

1353
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:31,110
there's a giant percentage of the people
that want to do it are massively damaged

1354
01:01:31,191 --> 01:01:36,191
people,
which is why they feel like they should 

1355
01:01:36,191 --> 01:01:36,830
be famous.
It's like they got fucked over when they

1356
01:01:36,831 --> 01:01:39,050
were children or when they were,
you know,

1357
01:01:39,051 --> 01:01:41,060
adolescents or whatever the fuck 
happened to them.

1358
01:01:41,061 --> 01:01:45,110
That led them to have this insatiable 
desire to be thought of as special.

1359
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:48,400
And once they get it,
that's when they become maniacs.

1360
01:01:48,790 --> 01:01:51,990
Like everybody's heard the story of the 
person who's got their own [inaudible].

1361
01:01:51,991 --> 01:01:53,920
Then they become maniacs.
I mean I've,

1362
01:01:53,921 --> 01:01:56,450
I've met them,
I've seen them,

1363
01:01:56,451 --> 01:01:57,270
you know,
I've talked to them.

1364
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:01,220
I had Roseanne on and she was telling me
about how fucking crazy she went.

1365
01:02:01,221 --> 01:02:03,110
When she got sick on,
she was like,

1366
01:02:03,111 --> 01:02:05,150
I was fucking crazy.
Completely crazy.

1367
01:02:05,151 --> 01:02:06,800
Like she'll,
she'll tell you.

1368
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:09,940
And she was a great standup comic in my 
opinion.

1369
01:02:09,941 --> 01:02:12,830
Like one of the top 10 greatest of all 
time,

1370
01:02:12,831 --> 01:02:16,940
like Roseanne's in my,
as far as like revolutionary influential

1371
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:19,710
stand ups I think for,
for time,

1372
01:02:19,711 --> 01:02:20,040
like she's

1373
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:22,980
a top 10 and she was in,
she went crazy.

1374
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:24,120
She,
they all go crazy.

1375
01:02:24,121 --> 01:02:26,310
It's like she seems totally chill now 
though.

1376
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:31,320
Yeah.
That's just perspective over time or 

1377
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:32,100
what.
But I think it's that she got rid of Tom

1378
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:35,590
Arnold that helped mom.
Guy Is,

1379
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:38,490
he is crazy.
Every cycle.

1380
01:02:38,910 --> 01:02:41,330
You know why he married her?
Get the fuck out of here.

1381
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:43,350
That's ridiculous.
Just me,

1382
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:44,940
like,
I feel like that's one of those guys,

1383
01:02:44,941 --> 01:02:47,610
if you watched like 12 hours of just his
life,

1384
01:02:47,611 --> 01:02:48,600
you'd be like,
Shit.

1385
01:02:48,710 --> 01:02:50,820
Yeah,
it's crazy.

1386
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:55,880
I met him.
I did the best damn sport show when he 

1387
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:55,880
was on.
He's a nice guy.

1388
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:55,880
Yeah.
But you know,

1389
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:57,990
he took his shot.
He had to do what he had to do,

1390
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:01,080
married Roseanne,
did what he had to do and then it didn't

1391
01:03:01,081 --> 01:03:03,540
work out.
It's weird,

1392
01:03:03,541 --> 01:03:05,010
man.
Some days my wife will be like,

1393
01:03:05,011 --> 01:03:06,000
Hey,
can we um,

1394
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:07,080
can we hang this painting?

1395
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:08,460
And I'm like,
ah,

1396
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:14,190
probably like the kids going to bed 
early.

1397
01:03:14,191 --> 01:03:16,680
Like it's a different negotiation I 
think when you're married.

1398
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:21,860
But like his was like,
you might have to marry Rosanne bar to 

1399
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:22,470
have a career.
That's just,

1400
01:03:22,471 --> 01:03:27,471
I'm saying she's lovely.
That's just a different kind of 

1401
01:03:27,471 --> 01:03:27,471
negotiation for the record.
That was,

1402
01:03:27,471 --> 01:03:28,950
yeah,
he sold his soul.

1403
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:30,920
I know what you're saying.
Thank you.

1404
01:03:30,921 --> 01:03:31,800
Did.
Yeah,

1405
01:03:31,801 --> 01:03:33,690
like I want to say that you,
like,

1406
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:36,900
you will trade sex for hanging up the 
painting.

1407
01:03:36,930 --> 01:03:40,190
Sure.
You'll make this house and I get it.

1408
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:41,970
I get it.
That's a good move.

1409
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:47,720
But that's like everybody wins.
It's like nobody got hurt there and you 

1410
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:47,720
love.
Everybody was happy.

1411
01:03:47,850 --> 01:03:49,290
He sold us all,
but he,

1412
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:51,060
but he got out of it.
He's alive.

1413
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:56,480
You get a refund on your soul,
like what do you think happens at that 

1414
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:56,480
point?

1415
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:57,190
Or do you feel like it's going to be 
misses Roseanne?

1416
01:03:57,191 --> 01:04:02,191
Dom on the devil,
he has a very steep price based on 

1417
01:04:02,401 --> 01:04:03,960
everything.
Big,

1418
01:04:03,961 --> 01:04:05,520
big number out here,
man.

1419
01:04:05,690 --> 01:04:07,530
I mean,
she's a super talented woman,

1420
01:04:07,531 --> 01:04:11,130
but she was 300 pounds and you know,
he did what he had to do.

1421
01:04:11,420 --> 01:04:12,360
What do you think?
Um,

1422
01:04:12,570 --> 01:04:14,190
what was,
what was her husband on that show?

1423
01:04:14,191 --> 01:04:15,000
John?
Uh,

1424
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:16,410
John Goodman?
Yeah.

1425
01:04:16,710 --> 01:04:19,320
Amazing.
One of those guys that I watch,

1426
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:24,920
I can't from from big Dan Teeg in 
brother where art thou to just anything 

1427
01:04:25,801 --> 01:04:27,600
he does.
He's almost people.

1428
01:04:27,601 --> 01:04:31,220
I want you to go ski that fucking 
character from the bigger basket.

1429
01:04:31,221 --> 01:04:33,030
It wasn't even.
You're not even Jewish man.

1430
01:04:34,790 --> 01:04:39,790
I don't turn on the TV.
Turn on the stove and I sure as Shit 

1431
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:42,620
fucking roll.

1432
01:04:44,730 --> 01:04:49,730
And he would pull out when someone 
violate bowling rules by the only one 

1433
01:04:50,341 --> 01:04:55,341
that gives a shit about the rules.
What a great fucking character is.

1434
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:01,590
Just.
He's amazing man.

1435
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:04,470
By three o'clock with Nail Polish.
Like what?

1436
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:06,660
How do you channel?
I'm finishing my coffee.

1437
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:10,290
There was a conviction of that being 
that crazy.

1438
01:05:11,730 --> 01:05:12,900
He just created a.
well,

1439
01:05:12,901 --> 01:05:17,901
first of all,
Coen brothers movies are my ultimate 

1440
01:05:17,901 --> 01:05:18,400
favorite movie.
Like when I saw Donald Trump was running

1441
01:05:18,401 --> 01:05:20,950
for president the other day,
I say we live in a Coen brothers movie.

1442
01:05:20,951 --> 01:05:22,170
It's official.
Seriously,

1443
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:27,180
because like his fucking Slob,
this is goofy Slob is going to run his 

1444
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:29,080
ego just pouring out of his ears.
He ever met him.

1445
01:05:29,180 --> 01:05:30,520
No.
Weird dude.

1446
01:05:30,521 --> 01:05:35,521
And I'm sure we met him.
We did something on top care where 

1447
01:05:35,521 --> 01:05:36,700
you're trying to convince him to like 
pick one of these cars that,

1448
01:05:36,730 --> 01:05:38,640
that we had each pick for a celebrity.

1449
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:40,690
We found out like halfway through,
it's for Donald Trump.

1450
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:43,540
And he basically was like,
uh,

1451
01:05:43,541 --> 01:05:45,910
this guy looks gay.
He's looking at tanner was like,

1452
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:47,920
I think this car,
you look gay.

1453
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:52,170
So the car's probably for gay person at 
whatever tailored to.

1454
01:05:52,190 --> 01:05:54,330
I don't remember what kind of car he had
picked the teams.

1455
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:58,650
Like what did you tell Donald Trump to 
make fun of me that I look like I'm in.

1456
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:04,080
That's just what he does.
He just went for it and then he was 

1457
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:04,080
like,
Adam,

1458
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:05,230
I'll take your.
Was it trying to be funny?

1459
01:06:05,290 --> 01:06:10,290
I think he was,
but he's one of those people that I 

1460
01:06:10,290 --> 01:06:14,011
don't think he can hear other people.
I think maybe he can read lips a tiny 

1461
01:06:14,011 --> 01:06:17,581
bit,
but like he walks into the room and all 

1462
01:06:17,581 --> 01:06:17,581
you do is you look at his hair,
man,

1463
01:06:17,581 --> 01:06:21,601
you can't.
There is nothing an asteroid hit the 

1464
01:06:21,601 --> 01:06:23,260
earth next door and you'd still be like,
man,

1465
01:06:24,310 --> 01:06:26,020
what's going on up there to that?

1466
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:28,600
Like how do you get up every day?
And you say,

1467
01:06:28,601 --> 01:06:32,080
yeah,
this is the look weirds me out.

1468
01:06:32,081 --> 01:06:36,130
Here's you and him weirds me out is.
It's not like he's going bald,

1469
01:06:36,730 --> 01:06:38,800
is he?
I don't think so.

1470
01:06:38,801 --> 01:06:43,801
I think he's just,
he just moves it around in some weird 

1471
01:06:43,801 --> 01:06:45,850
way or doesn't want to cut it or it's a 
signature look,

1472
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:49,660
but it seems like there's too much hair 
up there for him to be going bald.

1473
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:52,210
It's just I ain't been there in real 
life.

1474
01:06:52,211 --> 01:06:57,211
So what do you remember the hair spray 
that had looked like hair follicles?

1475
01:06:57,700 --> 01:06:59,560
I don't know if it's like that's in 
there.

1476
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:02,110
It's not a,
it's not a rug.

1477
01:07:02,111 --> 01:07:05,290
It's in the book.
It's just,

1478
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:08,140
you can't take your eyes off of it.
I just don't understand.

1479
01:07:08,141 --> 01:07:11,620
I mean,
he can't think it looks good dudes.

1480
01:07:11,621 --> 01:07:16,621
So in a weird,
because New York doesn't actually like 

1481
01:07:16,621 --> 01:07:16,621
him that much,
but like some.

1482
01:07:16,621 --> 01:07:16,800
Right.
But you like him?

1483
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:19,180
He's a Dick.
He puts his face on everything,

1484
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:21,370
but he's like,
he's so aggressive with his,

1485
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:23,710
like stickiness.
Like I remember he had this feud with,

1486
01:07:24,010 --> 01:07:25,450
with the,
um,

1487
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:28,720
with the fuck's her name.
Who was it with?

1488
01:07:28,890 --> 01:07:30,460
God Damn it.
Oh,

1489
01:07:30,461 --> 01:07:31,930
with Rosie O'donnell,
that's who it was.

1490
01:07:32,190 --> 01:07:34,360
His,
his feud with Rosie O'donnell and he was

1491
01:07:34,361 --> 01:07:37,210
on know TV's like Rosie is a losers.
Basically.

1492
01:07:37,211 --> 01:07:38,220
She's a loser.
Right,

1493
01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:43,430
okay.
Let's think about who's listening to 

1494
01:07:43,430 --> 01:07:44,860
this.
You're talking about a multi millionaire

1495
01:07:44,861 --> 01:07:49,861
movie star world famous comedian and 
you're talking in a camera's on you and 

1496
01:07:51,341 --> 01:07:56,341
it's broadcasting to the rest of the 
world and you're saying this 

1497
01:07:56,341 --> 01:07:58,150
multimillionaire world famous comedian 
is in fact the loser.

1498
01:07:58,280 --> 01:07:59,620
What are we?
Right?

1499
01:07:59,650 --> 01:08:01,660
What the fuck am I?
What am I?

1500
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:06,661
If she's a loser,
like what standards do you have and how 

1501
01:08:06,661 --> 01:08:06,661
do you feel about yourself?

1502
01:08:06,661 --> 01:08:06,750
Right?
You know,

1503
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:08,410
like this is just nonsense.
He,

1504
01:08:08,411 --> 01:08:11,260
that guy needs mushrooms in his life in 
a bad way,

1505
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:16,440
is to get in a tent in the middle of the
desert and eat a giant bag of mushrooms 

1506
01:08:16,791 --> 01:08:19,520
and really find out how the rest of the 
world sees him.

1507
01:08:19,550 --> 01:08:20,890
Sweat it out.
Oculus,

1508
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:25,900
I think he needs to go to a sears and 
pick out a washer and dryer like a 

1509
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:27,740
Thursday night.
Like I think he may be normal person.

1510
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:30,260
Maybe just feel like what life is kind 
of like.

1511
01:08:30,270 --> 01:08:35,270
But I like those.
Those are the kind of people that I see 

1512
01:08:35,270 --> 01:08:35,270
in like his wife,
um,

1513
01:08:35,270 --> 01:08:36,170
malaria,
malaria,

1514
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:37,990
malaria,
some of them,

1515
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:39,320
whatever her name is,
Larry,

1516
01:08:39,321 --> 01:08:44,321
I'm.
That's one of those girls that I would 

1517
01:08:44,321 --> 01:08:44,321
look at her and then look at him and 
think,

1518
01:08:44,510 --> 01:08:47,520
there's no way you guys have ever had a 
conversation right now.

1519
01:08:47,530 --> 01:08:49,340
You look at her,
you look at him and you go,

1520
01:08:49,341 --> 01:08:52,540
do you know Tom Arnold?
Is He did what you're doing.

1521
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:54,740
He did it with a woman.
Right?

1522
01:08:54,741 --> 01:08:56,620
I see what you're doing.
I get you.

1523
01:08:56,670 --> 01:08:57,950
It's all right.
Hey,

1524
01:08:57,951 --> 01:09:02,951
look,
it's better that than working at 

1525
01:09:02,951 --> 01:09:02,951
Wendy's.
If these are your odds.

1526
01:09:02,951 --> 01:09:03,110
It's true.
What do you want to do?

1527
01:09:03,150 --> 01:09:05,300
Do you get trump's dick or get a lot of 
money?

1528
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:06,920
Do you get the free frosties?

1529
01:09:09,350 --> 01:09:10,030
Donald?
I've,

1530
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:11,900
I gotta give you that,
but your wacky hair,

1531
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:14,900
if you're into that,
it's because you're in a what?

1532
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:15,820
Tens?
Yeah.

1533
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:18,640
Who's into that?
Who's in the hutches mouth shut.

1534
01:09:18,870 --> 01:09:20,810
I was thinking.
I was really thinking for her.

1535
01:09:20,870 --> 01:09:22,160
Like if you're really into.
Oh,

1536
01:09:22,161 --> 01:09:23,780
she's not into that.
I don't know.

1537
01:09:24,150 --> 01:09:29,150
She's probably pilled up.
She'd probably just stays on a steady 

1538
01:09:29,150 --> 01:09:30,170
oxycontin drip throughout the entire 
day,

1539
01:09:30,870 --> 01:09:35,870
just just stays mellow and weird looking
at a gelatinous facial thing he's got 

1540
01:09:37,161 --> 01:09:42,161
going on too.
Was really the shoulder rolls into his 

1541
01:09:42,161 --> 01:09:42,830
neck colors.
Really interesting here too.

1542
01:09:42,890 --> 01:09:44,090
I'm telling you,
I meet him.

1543
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:46,120
I hope not necessarily that you meet 
them,

1544
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:51,160
but just that you're in in your life.
You end up in the same room and just 

1545
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:51,620
test my theory.
I honestly,

1546
01:09:51,621 --> 01:09:55,270
I couldn't look away the moment if I did
meet him.

1547
01:09:55,290 --> 01:09:58,640
The moment he gets Dickie,
I will grab your fucking hair.

1548
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:02,120
I'm just telling you right now and I 
will find out what's going on.

1549
01:10:02,121 --> 01:10:03,440
So you might want to shut the fuck up.

1550
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:07,490
What are you going to do?
Beat me up.

1551
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:13,100
Call security.
I better get your hair before security 

1552
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:13,100
gets here.
I Bet I get to your fucking hair,

1553
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:15,140
dude.
Don't get ticket with me just to lead in

1554
01:10:17,870 --> 01:10:20,270
the later stages of my life or whatever 
where I'm at.

1555
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:22,100
I don't have any patience for people 
like that.

1556
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:24,800
Just don't have any desire.
I get it.

1557
01:10:24,801 --> 01:10:25,060
Like,
uh,

1558
01:10:25,170 --> 01:10:30,170
you know,
that's the reason why he's so 

1559
01:10:30,170 --> 01:10:30,170
successful.
I mean,

1560
01:10:30,170 --> 01:10:30,170
you don't get to be a super fucking 
billionaire.

1561
01:10:30,170 --> 01:10:33,800
Real estate mogul has his name on every 
building dot trump towers.

1562
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:38,860
Right?
You don't get that unless you have that 

1563
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:38,860
sort of an attitude.
So I guess I understand.

1564
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:40,340
Stay there history,
put us up there once for the upfronts.

1565
01:10:40,510 --> 01:10:45,510
And uh,
I opened the little like mini bar and 

1566
01:10:45,510 --> 01:10:47,450
his face was on the vodka for me.
I was like,

1567
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:49,070
this feels like too much,
bro.

1568
01:10:50,020 --> 01:10:55,020
I feel like you've got to draw a line 
somewhere or you just go for it.

1569
01:10:55,800 --> 01:11:00,800
Just go for it.
If you just keep going like the further 

1570
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:03,401
and deeper you go into the crazy ego,
swimming pool becomes like warmer water 

1571
01:11:03,401 --> 01:11:06,980
because it gets better.
Is that the more he can be like the Walt

1572
01:11:06,980 --> 01:11:10,190
Disney of total douchebag,
real estate moguls,

1573
01:11:10,220 --> 01:11:13,200
is that.
It was,

1574
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:16,410
it felt like Disney world.
I couldn't escape his face.

1575
01:11:16,470 --> 01:11:18,210
He's got steaks,
trump steaks.

1576
01:11:18,211 --> 01:11:23,211
Look above that job.
I think those are made from a manatees 

1577
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:27,590
in endangered species.
Polar bear stakes.

1578
01:11:27,591 --> 01:11:28,160
Yeah.
Right,

1579
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:34,280
right.
When they get sad about the fucking 

1580
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:36,081
icebergs melting,
they shoot him in the fucking head and 

1581
01:11:36,081 --> 01:11:36,300
cut them up,
drag them down in New York and he's ever

1582
01:11:36,301 --> 01:11:38,590
had a hot dog cart.
Yeah,

1583
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:40,690
I'm sure he has.
I mean a,

1584
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:42,840
uh,
like all bullshit aside.

1585
01:11:42,841 --> 01:11:47,841
Like you gotta he went fairly bankrupt 
and then built it right back up again.

1586
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:50,460
Good for him.
I mean he really did.

1587
01:11:50,461 --> 01:11:55,461
He hit a point in our lifetime where he 
like basically was worth what we're 

1588
01:11:55,461 --> 01:11:56,640
worth,
you know,

1589
01:11:56,770 --> 01:12:01,770
so it went down to almost nothing and 
then he just shot right back up to being

1590
01:12:01,771 --> 01:12:06,771
that guy again.
There was like one week where he 

1591
01:12:06,771 --> 01:12:06,771
thought,
can I,

1592
01:12:06,771 --> 01:12:07,500
can I go to the grocery store?
Do I need to wait a couple days before I

1593
01:12:07,501 --> 01:12:08,640
go?
And then he's like,

1594
01:12:08,641 --> 01:12:10,320
okay,
you want me to be a millionaire?

1595
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:13,680
Then he,
I think never stop being a millionaire I

1596
01:12:13,681 --> 01:12:16,380
think,
but it got down to like a million.

1597
01:12:16,590 --> 01:12:20,040
But he might have had a lot of debt to.
I forget what the entire story was,

1598
01:12:20,041 --> 01:12:25,041
but it was,
there was a store that I've read in one 

1599
01:12:25,041 --> 01:12:27,351
of those magazines,
esquire in New York or something like 

1600
01:12:27,351 --> 01:12:29,781
that and they were essentially saying 
that what he's doing right now is 

1601
01:12:29,781 --> 01:12:32,040
pretending that he's rich and then if 
you look at like the amount of debt that

1602
01:12:32,041 --> 01:12:34,980
he had,
but he knew how to get rich.

1603
01:12:35,310 --> 01:12:37,260
I like that knows what the fuck he's 
doing.

1604
01:12:37,810 --> 01:12:40,200
You just.
And I always wonder like,

1605
01:12:40,201 --> 01:12:44,010
do you like to be a Michael Jordan?
Don't you have to be kind of crazy,

1606
01:12:44,370 --> 01:12:49,370
you know,
truly that Goddamn damn good at 

1607
01:12:49,370 --> 01:12:50,640
basketball and to be that fucking deal 
making son of a bitch,

1608
01:12:51,150 --> 01:12:54,210
don't you have to be a real asshole.
I think you,

1609
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:57,530
I think you have to trade in like,
okay,

1610
01:12:57,531 --> 01:12:59,910
look,
he claimed his network was 9 billion.

1611
01:12:59,911 --> 01:13:02,580
We figure is close to 4 billion 
[inaudible] billion to be exact,

1612
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:04,920
but this is,
this is recently now,

1613
01:13:04,921 --> 01:13:06,480
right?
This is yesterday.

1614
01:13:06,810 --> 01:13:07,980
Yeah,
but this is like,

1615
01:13:08,010 --> 01:13:10,770
look,
even if he's worth 4 billion or knight,

1616
01:13:10,771 --> 01:13:12,990
who gives a fuck?
He's a goddamn billionaire.

1617
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:18,320
You know,
he wasn't a while ago at one point in 

1618
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:19,650
time,
I want to say like maybe 15 years ago,

1619
01:13:19,890 --> 01:13:21,630
maybe 20,
something like that.

1620
01:13:21,690 --> 01:13:26,690
He had hit a,
like a really a really bad spot and 

1621
01:13:26,690 --> 01:13:28,120
there was a,
an issue with him,

1622
01:13:28,121 --> 01:13:33,121
like opening up golf courses,
look some golf course in Scotland and 

1623
01:13:33,121 --> 01:13:34,680
this one guy was fighting it and this 
one guy,

1624
01:13:34,681 --> 01:13:39,681
like he had land that was outside of the
golf course and they wanted to buy him 

1625
01:13:39,681 --> 01:13:40,740
out and he wouldn't sell and it became 
this huge issue.

1626
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:41,730
Who are,
you know,

1627
01:13:41,731 --> 01:13:43,350
Donald Trump's like,
this guy's a loser.

1628
01:13:43,351 --> 01:13:45,020
He wants to show me his property.
And the guy's like,

1629
01:13:45,030 --> 01:13:48,980
I don't give a fuck about him.
This is my house man fucking stone.

1630
01:13:49,290 --> 01:13:51,480
But it was,
it was a fascinating thing.

1631
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:56,780
It's like this,
this insane pursuit of just ungodly 

1632
01:13:56,941 --> 01:14:01,941
wealth and that's what he does.
That's his thing and now he's going to 

1633
01:14:01,941 --> 01:14:02,910
run for president.
It's a weird man.

1634
01:14:02,911 --> 01:14:07,911
I'm all about keeping the lights on,
but sometimes you watch those people 

1635
01:14:07,911 --> 01:14:07,911
that don't.
They don't know what you know.

1636
01:14:07,911 --> 01:14:10,980
There has to be this good balance of 
work.

1637
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:16,110
Hustle and drive in enjoyment,
like if you're just doing stuff all the 

1638
01:14:16,110 --> 01:14:18,370
time and you can't find anything good 
out of life,

1639
01:14:18,371 --> 01:14:21,010
you should probably just check up a 
little bit.

1640
01:14:22,190 --> 01:14:27,190
Maybe he does find good out of life.
They asked me to be on that celebrity 

1641
01:14:27,190 --> 01:14:27,190
apprentice thing.

1642
01:14:27,190 --> 01:14:29,140
I thought about it for a second,
but I would have been great man.

1643
01:14:29,170 --> 01:14:30,950
I'm not into that man.
I just,

1644
01:14:30,951 --> 01:14:32,740
I don't like those shows.
I don't,

1645
01:14:32,741 --> 01:14:36,050
I don't,
I don't like those fake scenarios work,

1646
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:41,160
any of that just didn't seem appealing 
to me and it wasn't a fuck load of 

1647
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:41,160
money.
It wasn't enough money where I was like,

1648
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:43,870
hmm.
But it also,

1649
01:14:43,871 --> 01:14:46,070
I don't,
I don't enjoy those kinds of.

1650
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:49,540
Would dance with the stars or you have 
no fucking chance.

1651
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:51,530
Not a chance in hell.
That's hard.

1652
01:14:51,780 --> 01:14:53,650
By the way.
I did a part in that movie.

1653
01:14:53,651 --> 01:14:55,450
Zookeeper and I had to learn how to 
dance.

1654
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:57,910
Me and Leslie Bibb,
we,

1655
01:14:57,911 --> 01:14:58,990
uh,
we did this,

1656
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:04,040
this dance scene where we had,
I had to learn how to dance for fucking 

1657
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:04,040
weeks,
had to take dance lessons.

1658
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:05,230
I was like,
that's awesome.

1659
01:15:06,580 --> 01:15:07,420
You know,
and they were like,

1660
01:15:07,421 --> 01:15:08,880
you should totally do dancing with the 
stars.

1661
01:15:08,890 --> 01:15:13,120
Like fuck you dude.
No chance.

1662
01:15:13,121 --> 01:15:14,650
And now it's not even dancing with the 
stars.

1663
01:15:14,651 --> 01:15:17,620
It's like dancing with the,
used to be stars like a long time ago.

1664
01:15:18,410 --> 01:15:20,620
The Internet sensations,
dancing with the people.

1665
01:15:20,621 --> 01:15:24,280
You kind of know who they are.
Like dancing with the people who someone

1666
01:15:24,281 --> 01:15:28,240
out there knows that the bachelor guy 
was just all there.

1667
01:15:28,850 --> 01:15:30,710
I don't know.
I don't have a nice.

1668
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:33,560
Whereas um,
he was from Iowa that,

1669
01:15:33,740 --> 01:15:35,050
those,
those are the people that are.

1670
01:15:35,051 --> 01:15:40,051
I'm proud.
Like when I go to the supermarket and I 

1671
01:15:40,051 --> 01:15:42,901
see us weekly and I look at the cover,
what I love is want to look at the 

1672
01:15:42,901 --> 01:15:42,901
cover.
I don't know anybody.

1673
01:15:42,901 --> 01:15:47,620
My good.
I don't know who the fuck are these 

1674
01:15:47,620 --> 01:15:47,620
people?
You know?

1675
01:15:47,620 --> 01:15:48,460
Dominic is mad a debra,
debra,

1676
01:15:48,461 --> 01:15:49,530
who's dominate,
right?

1677
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:50,650
Talking about good.
I'm glad.

1678
01:15:50,651 --> 01:15:53,380
I don't know.
I'm glad I'm out of that cultural loop.

1679
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:54,520
It's strange,
man.

1680
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:59,640
I'm not sure why.
I'm sure you're thinking about this all 

1681
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:02,131
the time.
I'm just not sure why people care about 

1682
01:16:02,131 --> 01:16:04,690
some of the people that we do that it's 
not really that we care.

1683
01:16:04,750 --> 01:16:09,750
It's that they broadcast people.
This is what I've thought about this 

1684
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:12,991
long and hard for a long time when you 
have something like television and it's 

1685
01:16:13,661 --> 01:16:18,661
something that is a,
just a natural thing that people come 

1686
01:16:18,661 --> 01:16:21,331
home,
they turn it on and they sit there and 

1687
01:16:21,331 --> 01:16:21,331
they badge.
I have children too and uh,

1688
01:16:21,331 --> 01:16:25,531
you know,
like if I want my kids to chill for a 

1689
01:16:25,531 --> 01:16:25,630
second and just like sit down,
like if I need to do something,

1690
01:16:25,631 --> 01:16:27,460
look,
daddy has to make a business call.

1691
01:16:27,550 --> 01:16:29,470
So I'm going to put on one episode of a 
show.

1692
01:16:29,471 --> 01:16:31,390
What show do you want to watch?
And then they'll sit down.

1693
01:16:31,660 --> 01:16:35,710
They fucking Zombie out,
right for that 20 minutes or 20 minutes,

1694
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:38,170
whatever.
The shows on their jaws open up and they

1695
01:16:38,171 --> 01:16:39,370
sit there.
I want a drink.

1696
01:16:39,371 --> 01:16:40,060
Okay,
get a drink,

1697
01:16:40,061 --> 01:16:41,140
here's your drink,
here's a chip.

1698
01:16:41,170 --> 01:16:42,130
You want some chips?
Okay,

1699
01:16:42,131 --> 01:16:43,420
here's your snack cheese stick.
Okay,

1700
01:16:43,421 --> 01:16:46,360
I'll be right over here if you need me.
And I know they're not going anywhere,

1701
01:16:46,390 --> 01:16:51,390
right,
but there's something that happens when 

1702
01:16:51,390 --> 01:16:51,390
people watch tv,
they just lock in.

1703
01:16:51,390 --> 01:16:55,690
Well if you get used to that thing being
on while you'll watch almost anything.

1704
01:16:55,691 --> 01:16:57,460
And that's how keeping up with the 
Kardashians,

1705
01:16:57,461 --> 01:17:00,730
it's still on the air because people sit
down there and they watch.

1706
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:03,140
They just sit there.
I was getting to buy this for us,

1707
01:17:03,180 --> 01:17:05,130
but then I couldn't find it and I was 
like,

1708
01:17:05,131 --> 01:17:08,300
oh my God,
this is sun knowing and I'm watching it,

1709
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:10,130
watching it.
I'll be in a hotel

1710
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:15,130
room when it comes on and if they edit 
it quick enough where it's like one 

1711
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:15,130
scene to the next scene,
one scene,

1712
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:15,320
the next scene.
They're like,

1713
01:17:15,321 --> 01:17:17,630
I'm watching a little ping pong match 
with my eyeballs.

1714
01:17:17,810 --> 01:17:20,870
For whatever reason I lock in.
I know their names,

1715
01:17:20,990 --> 01:17:22,550
I know their.
I know their names.

1716
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:27,640
I know the why.
If I look at the poor Bruce Jenner 

1717
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:30,401
bastard before it became a woman,
I know about all those people for no 

1718
01:17:30,401 --> 01:17:32,180
reason.
There's not a goddamn thing they've ever

1719
01:17:32,181 --> 01:17:32,830
said.
I've been.

1720
01:17:32,831 --> 01:17:35,990
It's been interesting to me.
This is not a content thing.

1721
01:17:35,991 --> 01:17:38,240
It's not a quality thing.
It's not a.

1722
01:17:38,270 --> 01:17:41,000
They have these.
If they're engaging,

1723
01:17:41,001 --> 01:17:43,970
they're these amazing points.
They're very unique individuals.

1724
01:17:43,971 --> 01:17:44,960
Now.
There's none of that.

1725
01:17:44,961 --> 01:17:47,990
There's none of that like because the 
show I really love,

1726
01:17:47,991 --> 01:17:50,060
it's called life below zero.
Ever seen that show?

1727
01:17:50,530 --> 01:17:52,490
No,
I feel like I've heard of that.

1728
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:55,220
So all these crazy fucks that live north
of the arctic circle,

1729
01:17:55,400 --> 01:18:00,400
above subsistence living.
This one woman that we had on the show 

1730
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:03,970
named Sue Akins and she lives 200 
fucking miles plus above the arctic 

1731
01:18:03,970 --> 01:18:07,220
circle in this place where you're not 
allowed to have permanent structure.

1732
01:18:07,221 --> 01:18:10,670
So she has tents that she built up there
and like these,

1733
01:18:10,671 --> 01:18:12,200
these,
these covered,

1734
01:18:12,201 --> 01:18:13,450
you know,
circular tents.

1735
01:18:13,670 --> 01:18:15,830
It snows like a fuck.
There's wolves everywhere.

1736
01:18:15,831 --> 01:18:18,150
She was attacked by a grizzly bear.
Okay.

1737
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:21,770
Broken her hip bone in your skull,
broke her leg.

1738
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:24,500
She went back,
shot the bear and ate it.

1739
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:29,860
Okay.
That's a person I'm interested in 

1740
01:18:29,860 --> 01:18:29,860
seeing.
You know what I mean?

1741
01:18:29,860 --> 01:18:31,550
Pitches gangster as fuck.
She lives crazy.

1742
01:18:31,551 --> 01:18:33,050
She's crazy,
but she's awesome.

1743
01:18:33,051 --> 01:18:34,940
She's a really.
It's really unique.

1744
01:18:35,090 --> 01:18:37,820
Like when I had her on the show,
sitting and talking to her because she's

1745
01:18:37,821 --> 01:18:39,470
so personable.

1746
01:18:39,570 --> 01:18:40,830
You had her here.
Yeah,

1747
01:18:40,850 --> 01:18:44,090
so she knows there are other places in 
the world she could live.

1748
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:45,830
She likes it up there.
She really does.

1749
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:49,280
I think people like weird shit.
Some people like living in Florida,

1750
01:18:49,730 --> 01:18:51,080
they like it.
They like Florida,

1751
01:18:51,950 --> 01:18:54,740
you know?
They just decide like I'm staying here.

1752
01:18:54,741 --> 01:18:56,690
Like it.
She loves it up there.

1753
01:18:56,691 --> 01:19:01,691
She loves the solitude.
She loves the fact that she has to rely 

1754
01:19:01,691 --> 01:19:03,070
on ourself and she.
But she's,

1755
01:19:03,170 --> 01:19:06,710
she's a unique human.
She has a very unique perspective.

1756
01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:11,240
She's very intelligent and very.
She's very strong and independent and so

1757
01:19:11,241 --> 01:19:12,920
that's the person that I want to hear 
talk.

1758
01:19:12,921 --> 01:19:14,510
Sure.
She's just unique.

1759
01:19:14,790 --> 01:19:16,490
Don't get any of that from,
oh,

1760
01:19:16,491 --> 01:19:19,850
we went there and oh my God,
this is so annoying.

1761
01:19:19,851 --> 01:19:24,851
The air conditioning was not working 
properly and those are not my favorite 

1762
01:19:25,281 --> 01:19:28,670
shoes and they hate you watching 
nonsense.

1763
01:19:28,670 --> 01:19:30,800
But as long as that nonsense is on 
television,

1764
01:19:30,990 --> 01:19:32,660
certain amount of people will watch 
nonsense.

1765
01:19:33,620 --> 01:19:37,890
Nonsense in the environment of dating.
He's like always exciting to people like

1766
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:41,660
who's hooking up with who is he going to
be with her or was he going to be there,

1767
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:46,760
she going to feel rejected or is he 
going to feel rejected or is she going 

1768
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:47,480
to reject him,
but then he rejects her.

1769
01:19:47,950 --> 01:19:49,970
God,
it's amazing.

1770
01:19:49,971 --> 01:19:51,920
There's suffering.
There's panic.

1771
01:19:51,921 --> 01:19:55,220
People are freaking out right now 
because it came out that I guess whoever

1772
01:19:55,221 --> 01:19:59,120
the current Bachelorette is might have 
slept with a bunch of the guys.

1773
01:20:00,490 --> 01:20:04,920
I've been telling sex with a man.
I've been telling my wife years.

1774
01:20:05,130 --> 01:20:06,960
I was like,
you know everybody on that show,

1775
01:20:06,990 --> 01:20:07,890
so can often.
She's like,

1776
01:20:07,891 --> 01:20:08,280
no,

1777
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:09,840
it's not.
It's not like that.

1778
01:20:09,841 --> 01:20:11,880
One of our,
one of our directors on top gray sky,

1779
01:20:11,881 --> 01:20:15,020
gary was was one of the directors for 
the first couple of seasons.

1780
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:20,700
There's a vault with footage every.
There's a camera everywhere and we feed 

1781
01:20:21,331 --> 01:20:23,940
these people tons of alcohol and hardly 
any food.

1782
01:20:24,270 --> 01:20:29,270
There's.
There's video of everybody humping like 

1783
01:20:29,270 --> 01:20:31,020
there's just a whole closet full of 
weird videos of these people hooking up.

1784
01:20:31,021 --> 01:20:34,920
Find Out who Caitlin sleeps with and the
surprising motivation.

1785
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:39,480
Click that fucking tab.
You shut that tab off.

1786
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:42,270
I don't want to ever see that again.
You keep that out of my life.

1787
01:20:42,271 --> 01:20:47,271
Jamie.
You may have to clear out the Google 

1788
01:20:47,271 --> 01:20:47,370
history just to.
Just to jumble clear your history.

1789
01:20:47,371 --> 01:20:48,330
Jamie.
That's what.

1790
01:20:48,331 --> 01:20:50,280
This is enough.
I can't do it.

1791
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:55,520
I won't.
I miss the days of of you remember the 

1792
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:57,270
real world and MTV like people's first 
started sort of look at like,

1793
01:20:57,490 --> 01:21:02,490
Oh,
I guess that people just sit around and 

1794
01:21:02,490 --> 01:21:02,490
drink all day.

1795
01:21:02,490 --> 01:21:02,760
They might get into fights about 
something that's seemingly important.

1796
01:21:02,820 --> 01:21:04,710
Well,
just as a bit of history,

1797
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:07,980
the guy who produced the real word world
was the producer fear factor.

1798
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:09,660
Might not know that.
Yeah.

1799
01:21:09,690 --> 01:21:11,580
Mac units.
Great Guy,

1800
01:21:12,170 --> 01:21:14,320
and he saw some.
He was the guy that forced the people in

1801
01:21:14,321 --> 01:21:16,830
there drinking.
Come on a fear factor.

1802
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:19,920
Was it from donkey?
Sure.

1803
01:21:19,980 --> 01:21:24,980
It was his idea.
He laughs at me when I told him he 

1804
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:24,980
shouldn't do it.
I'm like,

1805
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:24,980
you shouldn't have people drink.
Come.

1806
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:25,710
He's laughing.
Why not?

1807
01:21:25,711 --> 01:21:27,720
They're going to do it.
Don't do it.

1808
01:21:27,810 --> 01:21:30,300
Don't fucking do it.
Don't do it.

1809
01:21:30,910 --> 01:21:35,040
And I didn't watch a ton of the show 
because I was just against like,

1810
01:21:35,050 --> 01:21:38,730
why would you eat exactly horse's anus?
I'm going to be honest with you.

1811
01:21:38,731 --> 01:21:41,810
I didn't watch it either.
I watched it maybe three times,

1812
01:21:41,830 --> 01:21:43,830
entire fucking hundred and 48 episodes.

1813
01:21:43,890 --> 01:21:45,340
I enjoyed some of the,
like the,

1814
01:21:45,341 --> 01:21:50,341
the physical things that people don't 
have to feel like I get why those were 

1815
01:21:50,341 --> 01:21:53,680
cool.
And I don't know what like Lake y'all 

1816
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:53,680
used for some stuff.
Stay at mostly boy,

1817
01:21:54,350 --> 01:21:57,900
that sucker looked,
had looked cold and it looked rough some

1818
01:21:57,900 --> 01:21:59,880
days.
How cold does it get?

1819
01:21:59,881 --> 01:22:01,860
Were living in California?
Two shits down.

1820
01:22:02,330 --> 01:22:06,460
It must have been 60 degrees in their 
water was like 75 degrees.

1821
01:22:07,470 --> 01:22:12,390
You've seen one snake on a stranger.
I just felt like this is not for me man.

1822
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:17,400
Well I get so used to like fucked up 
things and vomit and like,

1823
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:19,920
like it just,
I'm just so used to it.

1824
01:22:20,010 --> 01:22:21,380
Um,
so like just unfazed.

1825
01:22:21,450 --> 01:22:22,600
One time my wife,
um,

1826
01:22:22,620 --> 01:22:25,830
she went to the gym and she had wheat 
grass juice right off the gym.

1827
01:22:25,831 --> 01:22:27,480
She threw up in her car.
She just couldn't help.

1828
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:29,340
But she was on the highway and she threw
up in her console.

1829
01:22:29,670 --> 01:22:30,840
She's like,
oh my God,

1830
01:22:30,841 --> 01:22:32,550
I can't even clean it all.
Throw up again.

1831
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:35,180
I will clean it.
I didn't give a shit no big deal.

1832
01:22:35,190 --> 01:22:39,390
Just going in there to throw up to me 
was nothing I saw throw up every day.

1833
01:22:39,790 --> 01:22:44,790
I mean,
literally every day I was at work is 

1834
01:22:44,790 --> 01:22:47,601
either someone throwing up or someone 
thinking they were going to throw up 

1835
01:22:47,601 --> 01:22:50,270
once a week for sure.
I saw three or four people throw up 

1836
01:22:50,270 --> 01:22:51,190
every week.
It was really like preparing,

1837
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:53,640
preparing you for being a parent to sort
of.

1838
01:22:53,710 --> 01:22:57,020
Yeah,
the diverse hit or anything else.

1839
01:22:57,050 --> 01:22:57,330
Like,
Oh,

1840
01:22:57,331 --> 01:22:58,290
let's get in there.
Well,

1841
01:22:58,291 --> 01:23:03,291
you know what,
that was one thing that really was 

1842
01:23:03,291 --> 01:23:03,291
shocking to me was,
um,

1843
01:23:03,291 --> 01:23:07,000
that it wasn't gross at all.
Like when it's your shit and you're 

1844
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:10,000
cleaning out a diaper and you're wiping 
and cleaning or it's not gross at all,

1845
01:23:10,001 --> 01:23:10,810
you just feel like,
oh,

1846
01:23:10,811 --> 01:23:11,620
this poor little thing.

1847
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:13,580
I got to help her.
I got to help her out.

1848
01:23:13,581 --> 01:23:18,581
And your uncle,
it's your uncle at a wedding and you're 

1849
01:23:18,581 --> 01:23:18,581
like,
this guy's got a problem.

1850
01:23:18,581 --> 01:23:19,480
Exactly.
This weirdo drunk bastard.

1851
01:23:19,490 --> 01:23:20,950
Shit crap.
Again.

1852
01:23:20,951 --> 01:23:23,810
Fucking savage.
How old?

1853
01:23:23,870 --> 01:23:26,740
How old are your kids?
The little ones are seven and five.

1854
01:23:26,741 --> 01:23:31,741
Seven to five.
And that means you've seen like doc 

1855
01:23:31,741 --> 01:23:31,810
mcstuffins,
doc mcstuffins.

1856
01:23:31,811 --> 01:23:34,930
I watch all the time to call her doctor 
stuffings.

1857
01:23:34,940 --> 01:23:36,460
It drives my girl's crazy.
Well,

1858
01:23:36,461 --> 01:23:41,461
you know what they think is funny now.
They like to watch shows that they 

1859
01:23:41,461 --> 01:23:41,890
already know in other languages and just
laugh and laugh.

1860
01:23:42,570 --> 01:23:44,350
Yeah,
they're like bubble guppies in French.

1861
01:23:44,351 --> 01:23:49,351
That's the latest plays in the car 
singing to apiece because you have 

1862
01:23:50,231 --> 01:23:51,850
daughters to people at home.
I'm like,

1863
01:23:51,851 --> 01:23:53,500
yeah,
not fantastic.

1864
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:55,980
People listening clear like Jamie over 
there.

1865
01:23:56,020 --> 01:23:57,250
No Kid,
no girlfriend.

1866
01:23:57,251 --> 01:23:57,850
Look at him.
He's like,

1867
01:23:58,240 --> 01:23:59,770
you should get some kids,
man.

1868
01:23:59,980 --> 01:24:02,540
It is a ride.
We have a dog,

1869
01:24:03,090 --> 01:24:08,090
do we?
But the beauty is when kids say things 

1870
01:24:08,090 --> 01:24:09,880
that you,
you know aren't wrong,

1871
01:24:09,881 --> 01:24:12,430
but you're not sure how to help them 
understand that publicly.

1872
01:24:12,431 --> 01:24:14,980
Sometimes they're incorrect.
We stopped on the.

1873
01:24:14,981 --> 01:24:19,420
We drove back from Chicago last week.
We stopped in a in a town called Arcola,

1874
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:22,600
I think it was in Illinois,
might have been Indiana.

1875
01:24:22,601 --> 01:24:27,601
It's something with an eye.
It's the home of the guy that created a 

1876
01:24:27,601 --> 01:24:31,171
raggedy ann and Andy Doll and it just so
happens there was a parade in Andy 

1877
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:35,030
Parade and kids here.
There's a parade and it's.

1878
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:38,500
It's like catnip to children.
They just go,

1879
01:24:38,501 --> 01:24:43,501
oh my God,
we have to see this parade and we're 

1880
01:24:43,501 --> 01:24:43,501
just trying to get them out of the car 
to stretch it looks.

1881
01:24:43,501 --> 01:24:43,770
Here we go.
Okay,

1882
01:24:43,771 --> 01:24:44,710
great.
We'll see the parade.

1883
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:48,460
Big woman comes up on a golf cart and 
she tells this high school girl,

1884
01:24:48,461 --> 01:24:50,410
okay,
plugging the speakers and this girl gets

1885
01:24:50,411 --> 01:24:54,360
out with a boombox,
like a disk man and two,

1886
01:24:54,490 --> 01:24:58,150
three inch speakers and she plugs it in 
with an orange extension cord.

1887
01:24:58,150 --> 01:25:00,780
And my wife turned to me and she says,
is,

1888
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:02,200
do you think that's the music?
I said,

1889
01:25:02,201 --> 01:25:04,390
honey,
just got this.

1890
01:25:04,430 --> 01:25:07,090
This is an exit off the interstate.
Let's look this up.

1891
01:25:07,780 --> 01:25:09,880
And then suddenly realize the parade has
begun.

1892
01:25:10,270 --> 01:25:12,140
My uh,
our four year old male,

1893
01:25:12,141 --> 01:25:13,510
he is on my shoulders,
LCR,

1894
01:25:13,511 --> 01:25:18,511
seven year old standing at my wife's 
holding the baby and so they start in 

1895
01:25:18,511 --> 01:25:20,740
the first group is about six women 
dresses,

1896
01:25:20,741 --> 01:25:25,741
Ragaini in and then one weird dude 
wearing striped socks and I don't know 

1897
01:25:25,781 --> 01:25:27,460
how to tell you this man,
but I just felt like saying,

1898
01:25:27,461 --> 01:25:32,461
hey dude,
you're not going to dress up like it 

1899
01:25:32,461 --> 01:25:33,100
just stand over here with the other 12 
of us watching this parade,

1900
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:35,710
which is all of a hundred yards long.
That actually,

1901
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:37,960
that that's way too.
It's like 30 yards long.

1902
01:25:38,380 --> 01:25:40,500
So the six,
the six women go buy it.

1903
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:42,580
Then there's about five high school 
girls dresses,

1904
01:25:42,581 --> 01:25:47,581
raggedy Ann.
They walk by and then there's the eight 

1905
01:25:47,581 --> 01:25:48,400
girls from the local high school,
flat core.

1906
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:52,690
That's the entire parade.
It takes maybe a minute and a half.

1907
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:56,110
And then lc,
the seven year old said,

1908
01:25:56,450 --> 01:25:59,710
is that a real loud chemo?
And all of town is there.

1909
01:25:59,711 --> 01:26:04,711
And then millie,
the four year old says that's the worst 

1910
01:26:04,711 --> 01:26:04,711
parade ever seen.

1911
01:26:07,070 --> 01:26:10,370
She's not wrong.
How to tell her like,

1912
01:26:10,380 --> 01:26:11,600
ah,
you sit there and you're like,

1913
01:26:11,601 --> 01:26:13,220
all right,
all right,

1914
01:26:13,221 --> 01:26:14,180
how do you do this?
And I said,

1915
01:26:14,630 --> 01:26:16,460
millie,
debt wasn't very sweet.

1916
01:26:17,590 --> 01:26:19,640
Very honest.
Let's just go get some food.

1917
01:26:20,030 --> 01:26:22,940
Let's get out of here.
And I know they tried.

1918
01:26:22,941 --> 01:26:27,941
But like sometimes when kids say stuff 
you just don't know how else to be like 

1919
01:26:27,941 --> 01:26:30,761
you're not wrong.
But socially we shouldn't say that out 

1920
01:26:30,761 --> 01:26:33,941
loud.
Well they need to experience that 

1921
01:26:33,941 --> 01:26:33,941
though.
They need to know that not everything is

1922
01:26:33,941 --> 01:26:35,240
the Disneyland parade.
Right.

1923
01:26:35,241 --> 01:26:40,241
Not Everything is Snow White and the 
cast of frozen and all the jazz that you

1924
01:26:40,251 --> 01:26:45,251
see a Disneyland like sometimes,
like sometimes in the middle of the 

1925
01:26:45,251 --> 01:26:46,370
country it's dog shit.
It's just a terrible fucking parade.

1926
01:26:46,430 --> 01:26:51,430
It's a terrible,
terrible raggedy and prey drive from La 

1927
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:52,710
to Vegas.
Yeah.

1928
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:53,870
Oh yeah.
You know those.

1929
01:26:53,871 --> 01:26:58,871
There's all this weird towns that you 
stop off along the way if you adventure 

1930
01:26:58,871 --> 01:27:03,460
still and just a great town in 
comparison to some of the really odd 

1931
01:27:03,801 --> 01:27:04,250
ones.

1932
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:08,270
Well there was one that was about an 
hour or so outside of Vegas.

1933
01:27:08,271 --> 01:27:13,271
I was with a couple buddies were driving
down to go as long time ago to go see 

1934
01:27:13,271 --> 01:27:15,410
some kickboxing event,
k one event that was in Vegas.

1935
01:27:15,650 --> 01:27:20,650
And so we said,
well let's just stop over here and go 

1936
01:27:20,650 --> 01:27:24,191
get,
grab something to drink or something 

1937
01:27:24,191 --> 01:27:24,191
like that.
So we pulled into this town and they had

1938
01:27:24,191 --> 01:27:25,640
a wild west show and I was like,
oh,

1939
01:27:25,641 --> 01:27:28,100
we are going to see this fucking wild 
too.

1940
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:33,400
So we got out and they had like a fake 
gun fight in the whole thing and like 

1941
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:35,720
there's these like shitty fake houses 
that were like,

1942
01:27:35,721 --> 01:27:37,500
you know those movies.
Yeah,

1943
01:27:37,690 --> 01:27:40,120
you have the front and there's nothing 
behind it.

1944
01:27:40,121 --> 01:27:42,570
Like Saloon Bank,
you know,

1945
01:27:43,850 --> 01:27:48,350
we got out and they had this whole act 
and all we could talk about for like the

1946
01:27:48,351 --> 01:27:53,351
whole weekend was that fucking Shitty 
wild west show that we stopped off just 

1947
01:27:53,351 --> 01:27:56,060
randomly,
completely randomly pull off the road,

1948
01:27:56,061 --> 01:27:57,830
drove a mile,
pulled in,

1949
01:27:58,040 --> 01:27:59,540
paid our money,
got out of our car,

1950
01:27:59,541 --> 01:28:04,541
smoked some weed,
got in and went to see this ridiculous 

1951
01:28:04,541 --> 01:28:04,541
wild west show.

1952
01:28:04,541 --> 01:28:07,280
That was the highlight of our weekend.
Not at the time,

1953
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:09,740
but became the highlight of our week and
all weekend.

1954
01:28:09,741 --> 01:28:14,741
We're just making fun of this fucking 
wild west show that we saw and their 

1955
01:28:14,741 --> 01:28:15,770
total commitment.
Right.

1956
01:28:15,771 --> 01:28:19,610
That's the part like when you see it and
there's like Wyatt earp walks out.

1957
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:21,710
It's not a guy who's kind of wider 
pitch.

1958
01:28:21,711 --> 01:28:24,620
This son of a bitch believes he is 
wider.

1959
01:28:24,670 --> 01:28:28,910
He grew that mustache curly at the poor 
bastards.

1960
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:34,120
They just made it kind of like the 
people that believe in doing the 

1961
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:34,280
reenactments.
Oh yeah.

1962
01:28:35,620 --> 01:28:40,620
I know how this could end the best 
reenactments or reenactments where you 

1963
01:28:40,620 --> 01:28:44,441
know it's a lie in the first place,
like a reenactment of like the time you 

1964
01:28:44,441 --> 01:28:48,071
saw big foot this fucking show on the 
sci fi network.

1965
01:28:49,641 --> 01:28:52,970
When I was on,
when my show was on Joe Rogan questions,

1966
01:28:52,971 --> 01:28:53,870
everything was on the network.

1967
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:58,130
They had this supernatural show that 
should've just been called the liars our

1968
01:28:58,460 --> 01:29:03,460
because it was all just a bunch of liars
and one of them was these people that 

1969
01:29:03,460 --> 01:29:06,921
said that they were trapped in a house 
in Maine while werewolves were outside 

1970
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:11,280
and they just going over this whole 
thing and they're like talking about.

1971
01:29:11,281 --> 01:29:13,320
And then they had like the reenactments 
of them,

1972
01:29:13,321 --> 01:29:17,430
like looking out the window and then 
like they're trapped.

1973
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:21,940
The werewolves not know that glass is 
super fucking easy to break your know.

1974
01:29:21,980 --> 01:29:23,850
So you're looking out windows.
The werewolves,

1975
01:29:23,851 --> 01:29:28,851
they're,
you're protected inside this fucking 

1976
01:29:28,851 --> 01:29:28,851
house when he's killing machines.
Yeah.

1977
01:29:28,851 --> 01:29:32,100
Well,
because they can't figure out how to 

1978
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:32,100
break the glass and get it.
The meeting.

1979
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:32,220
Delicious portions inside.
Right?

1980
01:29:32,310 --> 01:29:37,310
Fuck out of here.
That's not how that works for the 

1981
01:29:37,310 --> 01:29:37,310
center.
The werewolves,

1982
01:29:37,310 --> 01:29:38,010
they're little like there's one in your 
lobby,

1983
01:29:38,020 --> 01:29:39,690
but genuinely frightened me.

1984
01:29:40,390 --> 01:29:42,990
You think it's going to stop and like 
use the doorbell?

1985
01:29:43,140 --> 01:29:45,120
No.
Well that's a rubber one.

1986
01:29:45,121 --> 01:29:46,980
It's really easy,
so it doesn't weigh that much.

1987
01:29:46,981 --> 01:29:49,800
Smack it wiggles.
If that was a werewolf,

1988
01:29:49,830 --> 01:29:52,260
it's going through your window.
It's gonna tear apart.

1989
01:29:52,261 --> 01:29:55,440
Everybody in the room,
but it's just those reenactments,

1990
01:29:55,470 --> 01:29:56,330
you know,
they're,

1991
01:29:56,331 --> 01:29:58,320
they're,
they're cheesy in the first place,

1992
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:01,920
but when it's a lie,
when you know it's a long time and those

1993
01:30:03,240 --> 01:30:04,880
are the best.
Do you like those guys?

1994
01:30:05,370 --> 01:30:10,370
They watching that show cracks me up.
Some of them are nice and some of them 

1995
01:30:10,741 --> 01:30:15,741
really believe,
but why did you to just look at each 

1996
01:30:15,741 --> 01:30:18,891
other with that funny look,
because we've had a bunch of those guys 

1997
01:30:18,891 --> 01:30:18,891
on that.
Nothing goes hundred guys,

1998
01:30:18,891 --> 01:30:20,400
but bigfoot hunter guys.
We've had a few of those on the show.

1999
01:30:20,401 --> 01:30:22,350
Ones that make the sasquatch call.
Oh yeah,

2000
01:30:22,351 --> 01:30:27,351
we had that guy.
That guy's a bad shouting nonsense.

2001
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:33,320
Not only that,
no one has ever recorded a sasquatch 

2002
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:35,280
where you know,
it's like if you do a coyote sound,

2003
01:30:35,310 --> 01:30:37,100
you know what a coyote sounds like.
Right?

2004
01:30:37,110 --> 01:30:39,180
He can hear coyotes,
they have recordings.

2005
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:41,190
You don't know what a fucking pig foot 
sounds like.

2006
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:44,610
No guessing because it's made up because
it's not a real thing.

2007
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:50,290
They just yell out into the Holler,
yell out in the Canyon.

2008
01:30:50,310 --> 01:30:55,310
How about those dudes and back?
The guys in Alabama a couple years ago 

2009
01:30:55,310 --> 01:30:56,410
that they said they had one in the deep 
freezer.

2010
01:30:56,500 --> 01:30:59,410
That guy had already hooked something 
just a few years before that.

2011
01:30:59,990 --> 01:31:00,400
It.
Yeah.

2012
01:31:00,401 --> 01:31:02,500
He had hosted a few years before that.
He said,

2013
01:31:02,501 --> 01:31:03,280
well,
that one was fake,

2014
01:31:03,281 --> 01:31:04,660
but this one's.
This one's real.

2015
01:31:04,710 --> 01:31:06,060
This time through.
Yeah,

2016
01:31:06,100 --> 01:31:09,310
we've got them for normal witness.
Season three is just the Werewolf one.

2017
01:31:09,780 --> 01:31:14,780
Oh,
please play some of this fucking stupid 

2018
01:31:14,780 --> 01:31:14,780
shit.
Look,

2019
01:31:14,780 --> 01:31:14,780
it says Joe Rogan questions.
Everything in the corner.

2020
01:31:14,780 --> 01:31:18,880
You.
These people were reenacting is this.

2021
01:31:19,060 --> 01:31:21,370
This is what the inside of the house 
would have looked like this.

2022
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:26,520
This is the reenactment account.
Froze.

2023
01:31:27,790 --> 01:31:30,570
I had this weird recurrent dreams plan 
at the same time,

2024
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:34,480
had a weird dream as a kid that I saw a 
lumberjack outside my house.

2025
01:31:34,481 --> 01:31:36,640
He was in a red and black flannel,
like,

2026
01:31:36,641 --> 01:31:41,641
uh,
the one big he used to wear and he had 

2027
01:31:41,641 --> 01:31:44,191
red eyes and I up to Alabama.
I would see him outside the house and I 

2028
01:31:44,191 --> 01:31:44,800
thought like,
that dude could get in.

2029
01:31:45,550 --> 01:31:47,050
Right.
But it was just a dream.

2030
01:31:47,290 --> 01:31:49,210
Yeah.
I didn't believe he was actually outside

2031
01:31:49,211 --> 01:31:54,211
there.
Scroll back to that guy talking about 

2032
01:31:54,211 --> 01:31:54,211
how the thing was outside while Joe 
hurted,

2033
01:31:54,211 --> 01:31:57,340
not just froze,
was he drunk,

2034
01:31:57,341 --> 01:31:58,750
dropped his keys,
look like,

2035
01:31:59,380 --> 01:31:59,980
and I and

2036
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:01,330
I felt very vulnerable.

2037
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:07,040
Do you have to have a mustache to have a
really crazy story or is that sometimes 

2038
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:08,850
just an added bonus?
Listen to this.

2039
01:32:09,010 --> 01:32:09,060
Yeah.

2040
01:32:14,100 --> 01:32:17,830
Paranormal witness season three.
That means they had two other seasons of

2041
01:32:17,831 --> 01:32:20,670
the shitty show.
I like.

2042
01:32:20,770 --> 01:32:21,360
He sees it.

2043
01:32:23,430 --> 01:32:23,790
Rachel,

2044
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:30,680
he was right there.
I was on my dodge Ram and that's when I 

2045
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:32,350
realized I had soiled and pants.
This thing was breathing.

2046
01:32:33,990 --> 01:32:35,700
I thought he was going to come in.

2047
01:32:39,150 --> 01:32:41,430
This is the worst recreation of all 
time.

2048
01:32:42,330 --> 01:32:45,640
Honest question.
Is it possible this guy had glaucoma and

2049
01:32:45,641 --> 01:32:48,240
it just the neighbor had a black lab.
It's possible.

2050
01:32:48,241 --> 01:32:49,710
This guy's been sniffing paint.

2051
01:32:50,250 --> 01:32:53,730
Three years old and he's got three brain
cells inside his head.

2052
01:32:53,731 --> 01:32:57,300
They're bouncing around off the walls.
He's an idiot.

2053
01:32:57,301 --> 01:33:00,900
He can't even pronounce sentences.
Just amazing.

2054
01:33:00,901 --> 01:33:03,270
Now he's going down.
Did they recreated this?

2055
01:33:03,330 --> 01:33:07,590
They actually made a show around an 
obvious lie and recreated.

2056
01:33:07,591 --> 01:33:10,860
It makes feel bad.
He left his keys out there.

2057
01:33:10,861 --> 01:33:12,280
I wonder if they're still there.
Well,

2058
01:33:12,290 --> 01:33:14,880
one of the things when I first started 
doing the sci fi show,

2059
01:33:15,060 --> 01:33:18,540
they were worried that the show is going
to be just totally debunking things,

2060
01:33:18,690 --> 01:33:19,170
and I said,
no,

2061
01:33:19,171 --> 01:33:21,570
I'm going to approach everything with a 
complete open mind.

2062
01:33:21,571 --> 01:33:26,571
I just want to find out what what.
What are these alien implants that 

2063
01:33:26,571 --> 01:33:27,450
people keep saying that they find in 
their bodies?

2064
01:33:27,660 --> 01:33:28,980
What are,
you know,

2065
01:33:28,981 --> 01:33:30,810
what our crop circles,
what are all these things?

2066
01:33:31,230 --> 01:33:33,360
The problem is once you start looking at
it,

2067
01:33:33,390 --> 01:33:38,390
you realize you're dealing with the same
type of human being over and over and 

2068
01:33:38,390 --> 01:33:38,430
over again.

2069
01:33:38,700 --> 01:33:41,580
You're dealing with these really 
socially awkward,

2070
01:33:41,850 --> 01:33:44,220
delusional,
bad liars,

2071
01:33:44,250 --> 01:33:46,260
right?
And that's a whole industry.

2072
01:33:46,261 --> 01:33:51,261
There's a whole industry of making shows
around the stories of these socially 

2073
01:33:51,261 --> 01:33:52,620
awkward,
bad liars.

2074
01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:55,530
Like I met one guy within three minutes 
of meeting them,

2075
01:33:55,580 --> 01:33:58,320
and I'm not exaggerating,
he told me that he saw big foot,

2076
01:33:58,650 --> 01:34:03,650
that he saw a bulletproof wolf that 
appeared out of mist and that he knew a 

2077
01:34:03,691 --> 01:34:06,630
spot where he could regularly some in 
Ufos.

2078
01:34:06,631 --> 01:34:11,631
They would come and these,
these orbs would show up and they would 

2079
01:34:11,631 --> 01:34:12,970
start moving around you.
And we were looking at each other.

2080
01:34:12,971 --> 01:34:17,971
It was like,
I can't believe we drove out to talk to 

2081
01:34:17,971 --> 01:34:19,380
this fucking a long shot.
Is he by any chance unemployed?

2082
01:34:20,310 --> 01:34:25,310
This guy actually ran his own bar.
He's got his own place job though,

2083
01:34:26,620 --> 01:34:30,180
like all his time would be taken up by 
believing nonsense.

2084
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:32,100
He might've lived in Florida or 
somewhere like,

2085
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:34,410
just get away with shit.
I love that.

2086
01:34:34,411 --> 01:34:39,411
Florida is your go to like,
what's the craziest place that this 

2087
01:34:39,411 --> 01:34:39,411
country has?
Florida.

2088
01:34:39,411 --> 01:34:41,790
That's everybody's craziest places in 
the south.

2089
01:34:41,791 --> 01:34:43,290
It really is.
It's the best.

2090
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:44,130
That's like,
we're like,

2091
01:34:44,140 --> 01:34:45,560
uh,
whatever happened to him.

2092
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:46,830
Moved to Florida.
Well,

2093
01:34:46,831 --> 01:34:51,831
I had a,
my friend Jim Florentine on the podcast 

2094
01:34:51,831 --> 01:34:51,831
the other day,
a stand up comic.

2095
01:34:51,831 --> 01:34:53,880
Love Him and he uh,
he moved to Florida when he was a kid,

2096
01:34:54,030 --> 01:34:56,250
he said because when he went there on 
vacation,

2097
01:34:56,280 --> 01:34:57,560
everybody got off.
He was like,

2098
01:34:57,561 --> 01:34:59,150
Shit will just.
He goes,

2099
01:34:59,151 --> 01:35:04,151
oh,
let's just move down here because you 

2100
01:35:04,151 --> 01:35:04,151
realize like in Florida,
like girls would just fuck.

2101
01:35:04,151 --> 01:35:08,471
Like things were crazy.
This totally different kind of human 

2102
01:35:08,471 --> 01:35:10,700
being that you're interacting with.
I love it.

2103
01:35:10,701 --> 01:35:14,200
That was his reasoning.
That's exactly what is brilliant.

2104
01:35:14,201 --> 01:35:14,830
It appear.

2105
01:35:14,970 --> 01:35:16,820
But if you live in New Jersey,
it's hard to get laid,

2106
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:22,240
you know,
if you're a young guy coming up in New 

2107
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:22,240
Jersey,
it's fucking to grind.

2108
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:22,240
Is it?
Yeah.

2109
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:25,460
It's a grind because all the big hair 
and like it's just a lot of work.

2110
01:35:26,090 --> 01:35:31,090
So they're not that fun.
You ever watched real housewives of New 

2111
01:35:31,090 --> 01:35:31,090
Jersey?
Once when I was getting it,

2112
01:35:31,090 --> 01:35:33,550
it's based on real humans drills.
Those are real human beings.

2113
01:35:34,110 --> 01:35:39,110
This is the one lady who literally,
her fucking hair starts an inch above 

2114
01:35:39,110 --> 01:35:40,110
her eyebrows,
like shit her,

2115
01:35:40,160 --> 01:35:42,680
she has her eyebrows and then an 
insulator her,

2116
01:35:42,770 --> 01:35:47,770
she's a monkey.
She's essentially some kind of monkey 

2117
01:35:47,770 --> 01:35:49,110
and they let this lady live with people 
and uh,

2118
01:35:49,190 --> 01:35:50,120
she wound up,
uh,

2119
01:35:50,121 --> 01:35:52,410
she's in jail now for like,
yeah,

2120
01:35:52,870 --> 01:35:55,080
it didn't work out to her husband.
Her husband's in eight.

2121
01:35:55,310 --> 01:35:57,020
He looked at her husband and he looks 
like a gorilla,

2122
01:35:57,021 --> 01:35:59,750
like someone shaved down a gorilla,
big fat Italian gorilla.

2123
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:04,070
And that's Jersey.
Do you know what I almost miss is a,

2124
01:36:05,460 --> 01:36:10,460
what was the MTV show?
Jersey shore that watching that train 

2125
01:36:10,460 --> 01:36:13,490
wreck happen was you have to admit like 
when that dude,

2126
01:36:13,491 --> 01:36:17,170
the situation was like,
like I'm a,

2127
01:36:17,180 --> 01:36:18,860
I've got a Lamborghini,
not for those.

2128
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:20,210
That was one of those moments where you 
thought,

2129
01:36:20,211 --> 01:36:25,211
kids,
I can't wait to tell you about this one 

2130
01:36:25,211 --> 01:36:25,211
day.
Stay on the air.

2131
01:36:25,211 --> 01:36:25,790
That's what's confusing.
Great question.

2132
01:36:26,900 --> 01:36:31,900
Somehow Pauly d like,
I don't know what he seems very 

2133
01:36:31,900 --> 01:36:32,150
charming.
I'm like,

2134
01:36:32,151 --> 01:36:37,151
I want to not like them,
but I kind of do because he's just fist 

2135
01:36:37,151 --> 01:36:37,151
pumping,
like chance.

2136
01:36:37,151 --> 01:36:38,660
Like I think he's just a dude that just 
knows what he loves.

2137
01:36:38,661 --> 01:36:39,090
Right?
Yeah.

2138
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:41,990
But snookie seems everyone else seems 
bananas.

2139
01:36:42,020 --> 01:36:42,680
Jesse,
the video,

2140
01:36:42,710 --> 01:36:44,590
the one where snuck,
he got punched in the face.

2141
01:36:44,610 --> 01:36:48,320
It was hard to watch.
Man was harder.

2142
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:49,490
I've been,
I've been in,

2143
01:36:49,730 --> 01:36:53,450
I've been in one fight in my life and it
was with one of my best friends in sixth

2144
01:36:53,451 --> 01:36:53,810
grade.

2145
01:36:53,900 --> 01:36:57,650
My Buddy Richard Davis punched me 
repeatedly in the face.

2146
01:36:57,680 --> 01:36:59,180
Why?
I was,

2147
01:36:59,181 --> 01:37:00,920
we're mad about something.
Right.

2148
01:37:00,921 --> 01:37:02,720
And it was like,
I'll meet you after school.

2149
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:06,770
Well,
I was like trying to like tackle him and

2150
01:37:06,771 --> 01:37:07,780
trying to.
I don't know what.

2151
01:37:07,860 --> 01:37:10,220
I don't know what I was doing.
I'd never been in a fight before.

2152
01:37:10,370 --> 01:37:14,120
My face was so swollen.
I told my mom that I had had an accident

2153
01:37:14,121 --> 01:37:16,700
on my bicycle because I didn't want to 
tell her like,

2154
01:37:17,390 --> 01:37:22,390
yeah,
my friend Richard from up the street 

2155
01:37:22,390 --> 01:37:22,390
beat the crap out of me.
Did you enrich your stay friends?

2156
01:37:22,390 --> 01:37:23,300
We're friends now.
Great Guy.

2157
01:37:23,700 --> 01:37:25,640
Great Guy.
Like that was a time when you could just

2158
01:37:25,641 --> 01:37:26,860
get in a fight,
right?

2159
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:29,680
It's fucked up.
How easy that guy punched her.

2160
01:37:29,980 --> 01:37:31,570
Like he just like,
you fucking bitch.

2161
01:37:31,571 --> 01:37:32,740
Boom.
Just punched her in the face.

2162
01:37:32,750 --> 01:37:36,280
Like there wasn't no like worry that she
was going to hit him.

2163
01:37:36,460 --> 01:37:38,800
She didn't have a knife,
she wasn't threatening him.

2164
01:37:38,801 --> 01:37:43,801
It wasn't like self defense.
It was just like he decided he didn't 

2165
01:37:43,801 --> 01:37:43,900
want her talking to anymore.
So he just knock it right in the face.

2166
01:37:44,860 --> 01:37:48,680
Your hat flew off.
Don't don't play that back.

2167
01:37:48,730 --> 01:37:51,510
Please go from the beginning though.
Here we go.

2168
01:37:51,540 --> 01:37:53,980
This guy was a school teacher to watch.
No,

2169
01:37:54,130 --> 01:37:54,870
boom.
Yeah.

2170
01:37:55,410 --> 01:37:56,730
And He.
Did he lose his job?

2171
01:37:57,150 --> 01:38:00,120
Of course he did.
I think he actually had some MMA fights.

2172
01:38:00,240 --> 01:38:00,990
No,
he didn't.

2173
01:38:00,991 --> 01:38:02,580
Yeah,
he just punched her right in.

2174
01:38:02,581 --> 01:38:05,960
The face isn't by the way that the human
body scraper.

2175
01:38:05,961 --> 01:38:06,690
Good friends.
I know,

2176
01:38:06,691 --> 01:38:09,480
but like what is it that made you get 
into.

2177
01:38:09,530 --> 01:38:14,530
Where did that come into your life?
Where did see 1997 when I first started 

2178
01:38:15,301 --> 01:38:18,840
working for them,
I did the post fight interviews in 1997.

2179
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:23,880
Was it something like that?
Had you seen it and kind of dug it and 

2180
01:38:23,880 --> 01:38:23,880
told him and those guys,
Hey,

2181
01:38:23,880 --> 01:38:24,460
was the for Dana.
Really?

2182
01:38:24,461 --> 01:38:26,040
Yeah.
I worked at the UFC before Dana.

2183
01:38:26,220 --> 01:38:29,430
I didn't realize that I quit and then 
Dana hired me.

2184
01:38:29,490 --> 01:38:34,490
Okay.
I did it back during the dark ages when 

2185
01:38:34,490 --> 01:38:34,490
I was banned from cable.
Right.

2186
01:38:34,490 --> 01:38:36,990
And it was like,
it was in the video store,

2187
01:38:37,050 --> 01:38:39,750
in the faces of death aisle where you 
see it.

2188
01:38:39,820 --> 01:38:42,540
Remember those?
I didn't watch them.

2189
01:38:42,541 --> 01:38:43,770
I just remember seeing him.
Well,

2190
01:38:43,771 --> 01:38:45,740
that's where you would find the UFC 
video.

2191
01:38:45,741 --> 01:38:47,370
So it was just,
it was a freak show.

2192
01:38:47,700 --> 01:38:48,840
And uh,
I,

2193
01:38:48,870 --> 01:38:53,870
my,
most of my life I'd been involved in 

2194
01:38:53,870 --> 01:38:53,870
martial arts from Tom was a little kid.

2195
01:38:53,870 --> 01:38:57,670
Sure.
So for me it was like that show a or 

2196
01:38:57,670 --> 01:39:01,431
that event was like the first time they 
had figured out a way to get different 

2197
01:39:01,621 --> 01:39:05,550
styles to compete against each other.
And for me as a martial artist,

2198
01:39:05,551 --> 01:39:09,230
it was entirely fascinating because I 
had always wondered like,

2199
01:39:09,270 --> 01:39:13,520
what would happen if a karate guy fought
a judo guy or what have you?

2200
01:39:14,060 --> 01:39:16,830
So the UFC was the first time someone 
has ever done it and put it together.

2201
01:39:16,831 --> 01:39:18,210
So it was a huge,
huge fan of it.

2202
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:23,720
And um,
they needed someone to do their 

2203
01:39:23,720 --> 01:39:25,701
interviews just the after the fight 
interviews and they literally didn't 

2204
01:39:25,701 --> 01:39:27,780
give me any instruction,
no advice,

2205
01:39:27,810 --> 01:39:32,810
nothing.
They put a microphone in my hand and 

2206
01:39:32,810 --> 01:39:32,810
they said,
okay,

2207
01:39:32,810 --> 01:39:34,430
we're going to come to you in three 
minutes.

2208
01:39:34,450 --> 01:39:36,990
Talk about the fights.
This is a live on pay per view.

2209
01:39:37,320 --> 01:39:42,320
I mean,
no one had briefed me when I say no one 

2210
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:42,320
to give me any advice.

2211
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:43,610
I mean,
they hadn't said a fucking thing to me,

2212
01:39:43,611 --> 01:39:48,611
right?
They turn the camera on me and they 

2213
01:39:48,611 --> 01:39:48,611
said,
okay,

2214
01:39:48,611 --> 01:39:48,611
you're live.
And I then I was like,

2215
01:39:48,611 --> 01:39:50,280
this is an amazing event.
Ba Ba ba Ba ba.

2216
01:39:50,290 --> 01:39:55,290
We got this guy who's going to fight 
that guy and the implications are blah 

2217
01:39:55,290 --> 01:39:56,850
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
And he's just got to train in Jujitsu.

2218
01:39:56,851 --> 01:39:59,250
And then that's it.
It's a fantastic event.

2219
01:39:59,251 --> 01:40:01,050
I can't wait back to you guys.
And I did it.

2220
01:40:01,051 --> 01:40:02,190
And I was like,
what the fuck am I doing?

2221
01:40:02,191 --> 01:40:03,240
Like who?
Let me do this,

2222
01:40:03,270 --> 01:40:04,560
right?
Like this is ridiculous.

2223
01:40:04,561 --> 01:40:06,450
Like the post fight interviews.
No,

2224
01:40:06,451 --> 01:40:08,180
no advice.
No one told me how to do it,

2225
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:10,740
not just set me in.
Their fight was over.

2226
01:40:10,741 --> 01:40:12,720
I had to come up with the questions I 
would ask him.

2227
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:15,270
It was very bizarre,
very bizarre,

2228
01:40:15,480 --> 01:40:16,110
very,
very,

2229
01:40:16,111 --> 01:40:17,250
very strange gig.

2230
01:40:17,250 --> 01:40:22,250
And I did it for about two years and it 
was like all little puddle up hopper 

2231
01:40:22,250 --> 01:40:24,810
planes flying into weird casinos in the 
south.

2232
01:40:25,460 --> 01:40:27,300
That was the only places where they 
allowed them to have it.

2233
01:40:27,830 --> 01:40:28,890
And uh,
I quit.

2234
01:40:28,891 --> 01:40:30,630
It was just too much,
just too weird.

2235
01:40:30,780 --> 01:40:33,450
And so I stopped for a couple years in 
the UFC,

2236
01:40:33,451 --> 01:40:38,451
got purchased by [inaudible] when Dana 
came into it for the brothers and uh,

2237
01:40:38,670 --> 01:40:43,670
I just became a fan and I was hanging 
out with Dana and Dana and I became 

2238
01:40:43,670 --> 01:40:45,570
friends and we would go to dinner and I 
would just start saying,

2239
01:40:45,571 --> 01:40:50,571
well,
why don't you have this kind of fight 

2240
01:40:50,571 --> 01:40:50,571
that guy?
Like,

2241
01:40:50,571 --> 01:40:50,571
what about this?
You ever see this guy find Japan?

2242
01:40:50,571 --> 01:40:50,571
Like,
do you know about this guy?

2243
01:40:50,571 --> 01:40:55,281
Do you know about that?
And I just started talking to him about 

2244
01:40:55,281 --> 01:40:55,281
all this different cities,
like,

2245
01:40:55,281 --> 01:40:55,281
do you want to do commentary?

2246
01:40:55,281 --> 01:40:55,360
I was like,
wow man,

2247
01:40:55,361 --> 01:40:58,800
I don't want to work,
I just want to come and drink fights and

2248
01:40:58,810 --> 01:41:03,810
have a good time.
And back then no one was watching it 

2249
01:41:03,810 --> 01:41:03,810
either.
It was like,

2250
01:41:03,810 --> 01:41:05,350
it wasn't like someone was asking me to 
do the UFC today.

2251
01:41:05,490 --> 01:41:08,150
Right.
It was like the UFC then was doing porn.

2252
01:41:08,340 --> 01:41:11,110
That's literally what it was like.
Like you want to fuck on film.

2253
01:41:11,111 --> 01:41:13,990
Like oh I don't know that much money is 
involved,

2254
01:41:13,991 --> 01:41:15,350
you know,
they're going to be alcohol.

2255
01:41:15,620 --> 01:41:17,270
You'd have to be like,
you know,

2256
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:22,320
to be involved.
And it was like detrimental for your 

2257
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:22,320
career.
But she was on news radio.

2258
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:23,500
I was doing the UFC.
Really?

2259
01:41:23,501 --> 01:41:28,501
Yeah.
They were flying me these weird places 

2260
01:41:28,501 --> 01:41:28,501
like I started in 97.
So yeah,

2261
01:41:28,501 --> 01:41:31,090
the news radio started in [inaudible] 
94,

2262
01:41:31,270 --> 01:41:33,730
so Nandini 94 95.
So it was like two,

2263
01:41:33,731 --> 01:41:36,370
three years in that I was doing that and
they were like,

2264
01:41:36,371 --> 01:41:41,371
what the fuck are you doing?
Like they were thinking about your 

2265
01:41:41,371 --> 01:41:44,071
weekend.
They were thinking it was bad for my 

2266
01:41:44,071 --> 01:41:44,140
career because like w filming would be 
over on Friday,

2267
01:41:44,380 --> 01:41:45,670
you know,
we'd be done filming.

2268
01:41:45,700 --> 01:41:49,570
I'd get on a fucking plane and I'd fly 
to Alabama and watched dudes get punched

2269
01:41:49,571 --> 01:41:50,650
in the head.
Right.

2270
01:41:53,800 --> 01:41:58,800
What else do you work with?
Like in Santa Barbara for the weekend 

2271
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:02,110
they were doing at fucking plays.
You're in Montgomery at the civic 

2272
01:42:02,110 --> 01:42:05,671
center.
They'd go to some musical that nobody 

2273
01:42:05,671 --> 01:42:07,981
really enjoyed.
Like you had to pretend that everybody 

2274
01:42:07,981 --> 01:42:08,500
enjoyed and I would come back and talk 
about,

2275
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:10,300
you know,
some crazy event.

2276
01:42:10,330 --> 01:42:12,970
Somebody's got to teeth kicked into the 
third row.

2277
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:14,980
It was a,
it was very strange.

2278
01:42:15,550 --> 01:42:20,550
I got to,
I got to do the Toyota pro celebrity 

2279
01:42:20,550 --> 01:42:20,550
race.
But cain Velasquez,

2280
01:42:20,700 --> 01:42:24,850
cain.
Cain is like a gentle giant right guy.

2281
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:27,070
Total sweetheart.
Total teddy bear.

2282
01:42:27,250 --> 01:42:29,950
But he could rip your house down like he
is.

2283
01:42:30,140 --> 01:42:31,390
He's visually to me,
he's like,

2284
01:42:31,391 --> 01:42:36,391
wreck it Ralph.
He could just come in and take out an 

2285
01:42:36,391 --> 01:42:37,540
interstate and I don't know what it is 
about like being around them,

2286
01:42:37,720 --> 01:42:39,650
but the first couple of days I was like,
hey guys,

2287
01:42:39,790 --> 01:42:44,790
nice to see you.
Don't kill me by like the end of the 

2288
01:42:44,790 --> 01:42:44,790
second week.
I was like,

2289
01:42:44,790 --> 01:42:44,790
what's up?
You want to just go,

2290
01:42:44,790 --> 01:42:46,150
just take care of this circuit.
I don't know why.

2291
01:42:46,330 --> 01:42:51,330
I started talking crap to constantly and
there was one time,

2292
01:42:51,980 --> 01:42:56,980
I don't know if he actually touched me 
or he just got real close and I did.

2293
01:42:57,221 --> 01:42:58,600
I shut down.
I was like,

2294
01:42:58,601 --> 01:43:01,930
Oh God,
I just want sort of limp,

2295
01:43:01,990 --> 01:43:03,530
like he's going to grab your neck or 
settlement.

2296
01:43:03,550 --> 01:43:04,570
Why?
I did that.

2297
01:43:05,140 --> 01:43:06,640
Every time I see him now I'll still 
like,

2298
01:43:06,641 --> 01:43:07,450
what's,
hey man.

2299
01:43:07,690 --> 01:43:09,220
Did you see the fight this weekend?
No.

2300
01:43:09,400 --> 01:43:11,470
Was it just nuts?
It was rough.

2301
01:43:11,530 --> 01:43:12,430
Yeah.
He got beat up.

2302
01:43:12,570 --> 01:43:16,030
I got beat up and then he got strangled.
So watching a guy like Cain,

2303
01:43:16,390 --> 01:43:17,860
uh,
who has been,

2304
01:43:17,890 --> 01:43:22,890
except from one fight,
he got knocked out by junior dos Santos 

2305
01:43:22,890 --> 01:43:22,890
in the first round,
the one fight.

2306
01:43:22,890 --> 01:43:24,760
But he went into that fight with a torn 
knee ligament,

2307
01:43:24,761 --> 01:43:28,420
like he was pretty busted up going into 
that fight and um,

2308
01:43:28,870 --> 01:43:32,820
he got caught with a huge punch from a 
real devastating knockout puncher.

2309
01:43:33,140 --> 01:43:34,780
Go Santos.
So that fight,

2310
01:43:34,781 --> 01:43:39,180
that loss was a tough loss,
but there was a lot of reasons behind it

2311
01:43:39,250 --> 01:43:44,250
kind of made sense.
Then he came back and dominated junior 

2312
01:43:44,250 --> 01:43:44,250
and the rematch and you know,
he's like,

2313
01:43:44,250 --> 01:43:45,940
in my opinion,
he's like one of the all time,

2314
01:43:45,941 --> 01:43:48,100
all time greats.
But to see him fight,

2315
01:43:48,110 --> 01:43:50,790
fabrizio over doing for preschool for 
Dylan was fucking him up.

2316
01:43:51,910 --> 01:43:56,120
And fabricio is like one of the best 
Jujitsu artist ever to compete in MMA.

2317
01:43:56,330 --> 01:44:01,330
Multiple time world champion.
And a cane was actually forced into 

2318
01:44:01,330 --> 01:44:05,891
taking fabrizio down and he took for 
heel into the ground and for resale 

2319
01:44:05,891 --> 01:44:07,160
economy a team and tap them out.
No Way.

2320
01:44:07,220 --> 01:44:08,120
It was crazy.
Well,

2321
01:44:08,121 --> 01:44:12,560
they fought in Mexico City down there 
training for,

2322
01:44:12,561 --> 01:44:14,000
for.
I don't know why.

2323
01:44:14,001 --> 01:44:19,001
I mean,
it seemed like it was in the middle of 

2324
01:44:19,001 --> 01:44:19,001
nowhere in Mexico training.

2325
01:44:19,001 --> 01:44:19,001
He was only there for two weeks.
Really?

2326
01:44:19,001 --> 01:44:19,520
And yeah,
somebody,

2327
01:44:19,521 --> 01:44:22,010
um,
I don't know where it was,

2328
01:44:22,011 --> 01:44:27,011
but somebody put it up on my message 
board that there's some sort of a 

2329
01:44:27,011 --> 01:44:30,200
formula of like altitude like that if 
you competed altitude,

2330
01:44:30,201 --> 01:44:35,201
you have to be there for x amount of 
days depending upon how high the 

2331
01:44:35,201 --> 01:44:38,831
altitude is.
There's x amount of days you have to be 

2332
01:44:38,831 --> 01:44:39,140
there in order to acclimate for Mexico 
City.

2333
01:44:39,141 --> 01:44:41,030
It's like 26 days.
Oh Wow.

2334
01:44:41,031 --> 01:44:46,031
And can only got there two weeks before.
So he had not acclimated at all and he 

2335
01:44:46,551 --> 01:44:49,810
just wasn't ready yet.
And the altitude is ruthless.

2336
01:44:49,910 --> 01:44:52,790
75 to 7,800
feet above sea level.

2337
01:44:52,820 --> 01:44:54,090
And people don't know.
Like I,

2338
01:44:54,230 --> 01:44:56,930
I've gotten altitude sickness on top 
gear before.

2339
01:44:56,990 --> 01:44:58,470
It's,
it's ridiculous,

2340
01:44:58,471 --> 01:44:59,450
man.
You just can't.

2341
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:01,970
Your body just doesn't know how to 
function.

2342
01:45:01,971 --> 01:45:05,660
It's like wearing the tightest belt on 
every part of your body.

2343
01:45:05,770 --> 01:45:08,000
It's just weird what it does.
It's real bad to just see.

2344
01:45:08,001 --> 01:45:10,040
I put a picture on Instagram,
I don't know if you saw it,

2345
01:45:10,280 --> 01:45:15,280
but there's an instagram picture that I 
put up that I took while we were 

2346
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:15,280
landing.
This is real.

2347
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:19,100
That's how bad the pollution is all in 
that same Mexico City,

2348
01:45:19,400 --> 01:45:24,400
Mexico City that's landing in Mexico,
so you see it on the big screen and I 

2349
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:25,970
mean I was like,
holy fucking shit.

2350
01:45:26,450 --> 01:45:28,550
That is it,
and as soon as I got down there,

2351
01:45:28,551 --> 01:45:33,551
I could smell it.
You smell it in the air and you get a 

2352
01:45:33,551 --> 01:45:35,630
headache right away because there's no 
fucking air because you're at 7,500

2353
01:45:35,631 --> 01:45:40,631
feet above sea level and whatever air 
that you have is filled with car 

2354
01:45:40,631 --> 01:45:43,850
exhausts and no traffic lights are a 
joke.

2355
01:45:44,120 --> 01:45:47,330
No one stops.
It's not even a suggestion.

2356
01:45:47,331 --> 01:45:47,840
It's just like they.

2357
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:52,840
They fought a government gig street 
somewhere and read right through.

2358
01:45:53,780 --> 01:45:56,170
Nobody was paying attention.
Everything's gridlock.

2359
01:45:56,360 --> 01:45:58,720
When you hit rush hour,
everything's gridlock.

2360
01:45:58,910 --> 01:46:00,650
There's no non gridlock.
You know?

2361
01:46:00,651 --> 01:46:05,651
Sometimes you get la gridlock.
Some selfish asshole decides that even 

2362
01:46:05,651 --> 01:46:09,281
though the light is turned red,
he's still going to make that left turn 

2363
01:46:09,281 --> 01:46:09,281
right and he gets blocked and people 
honk and he's like,

2364
01:46:09,281 --> 01:46:11,810
just looking ahead.
Lucky doesn't notice you in Mexico.

2365
01:46:11,811 --> 01:46:16,811
That's just what they do.
There's just too many people and it's 

2366
01:46:16,811 --> 01:46:17,390
not even their fault.
It's just that it's just out of control.

2367
01:46:17,510 --> 01:46:22,510
Just too many people I saw people pull 
out into intersections and it's like a 

2368
01:46:22,510 --> 01:46:25,130
kamikaze maneuver.
The traffic's going and they just go.

2369
01:46:25,930 --> 01:46:28,700
They just pull out and you have to slam 
on the breaks.

2370
01:46:28,701 --> 01:46:30,710
They just decide no one's going to let 
you in.

2371
01:46:30,770 --> 01:46:31,760
Right?
You just have to make.

2372
01:46:31,790 --> 01:46:33,590
You just have to make your way.
Just go for it.

2373
01:46:33,800 --> 01:46:38,800
And so like traffic was going and this 
guy's like creeping in front of car and 

2374
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:43,031
you see people hitting the brakes.
Then he would recognize that a little 

2375
01:46:43,031 --> 01:46:45,970
bit of an opening,
so you're going to be gone it a car 

2376
01:46:45,970 --> 01:46:49,181
length ahead and like fuck.
And watching it was giving me a 

2377
01:46:49,181 --> 01:46:49,181
headache.
I was like,

2378
01:46:49,181 --> 01:46:53,111
this is crazy.
A crazy way to live and there's like 40 

2379
01:46:53,111 --> 01:46:54,720
million people or something like that.
It's much larger than La,

2380
01:46:55,050 --> 01:46:57,300
much larger,
much larger.

2381
01:46:57,390 --> 01:47:00,630
2000 feet above Denver and polluted as 
fuck.

2382
01:47:01,250 --> 01:47:03,000
It's madness.
How's the food?

2383
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:05,040
Great.
The people are great too.

2384
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:07,170
That's the interesting thing.
They're very,

2385
01:47:07,171 --> 01:47:08,580
very nice.
They're super,

2386
01:47:08,581 --> 01:47:11,670
super friendly.
I get it to just easy going,

2387
01:47:11,850 --> 01:47:15,030
even though they're in a giant ass city.
It's not like a New York thing,

2388
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:16,860
like sometimes in New York.

2389
01:47:17,010 --> 01:47:19,260
I love New York.
I love the vibe of it.

2390
01:47:19,261 --> 01:47:21,180
I love the fact there's so many great 
restaurants.

2391
01:47:21,181 --> 01:47:24,380
It's so much stuff to do.
It's like this is a crazy pack,

2392
01:47:24,620 --> 01:47:29,620
a packet of energy,
but the abrasive nature of some of the 

2393
01:47:29,620 --> 01:47:33,711
people,
it really gets to me like totally like 

2394
01:47:33,711 --> 01:47:35,670
the Tsa in New York.
You go to Kennedy airport.

2395
01:47:35,671 --> 01:47:39,530
It's like some of the rudest fucking 
people I've ever met at a,

2396
01:47:39,610 --> 01:47:42,120
at an airport there or just in the 
world.

2397
01:47:42,240 --> 01:47:43,670
They just happened to be at the airport 
at that.

2398
01:47:43,750 --> 01:47:45,840
It's like it's.
It's just that attitude.

2399
01:47:45,841 --> 01:47:48,930
I think it's because there's so many 
human beings jammed into this place that

2400
01:47:48,931 --> 01:47:53,931
people like,
they lose an appreciation for each 

2401
01:47:53,931 --> 01:47:53,931
other.
Yeah.

2402
01:47:53,931 --> 01:47:55,130
Which you know,
if you grew up in a small town or if you

2403
01:47:55,170 --> 01:48:00,170
have ever been to a small town,
the one thing that people love that 

2404
01:48:00,170 --> 01:48:00,840
people look at you and they say hi when 
you walked on the street and wave,

2405
01:48:00,920 --> 01:48:01,830
kind of appreciate.

2406
01:48:01,830 --> 01:48:02,610
Yes,
there's not.

2407
01:48:02,850 --> 01:48:06,720
We're not overwhelming each other.
I think in cities like New York,

2408
01:48:07,080 --> 01:48:12,080
there's just too many God damn people 
smushed in next to each other and in la 

2409
01:48:12,080 --> 01:48:15,860
too.
That's why everybody gets so angry on 

2410
01:48:15,860 --> 01:48:15,860
the road.
Sure world,

2411
01:48:15,860 --> 01:48:16,590
we're overwhelming each other and we're 
not valuable.

2412
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:21,800
There's too many of us just New York 
with with more cars that people can 

2413
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:25,050
drive versus taxis,
but when you're in New York,

2414
01:48:25,140 --> 01:48:30,140
I'm always astounded that it seems like 
everyone is simultaneously upset that 

2415
01:48:30,181 --> 01:48:35,181
they're there,
but they will tell you it is the 

2416
01:48:35,181 --> 01:48:35,181
greatest city in the world.
Yeah,

2417
01:48:35,181 --> 01:48:35,460
but they're all like,
this place sucks.

2418
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:36,120
Really?
Yeah.

2419
01:48:36,121 --> 01:48:37,500
But I love it.
God never leave.

2420
01:48:37,530 --> 01:48:42,530
Well,
the dumbest fucking people in the world 

2421
01:48:42,530 --> 01:48:44,271
are the ones that are they.
They act like there's something special 

2422
01:48:44,271 --> 01:48:44,400
because they're from New York.
Like,

2423
01:48:44,420 --> 01:48:44,880
Hey,
listen,

2424
01:48:44,881 --> 01:48:46,590
I'm from New York.
I could handle myself,

2425
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:47,670
you know,
like of like,

2426
01:48:47,671 --> 01:48:52,671
well,
you know how to fight because you were 

2427
01:48:52,671 --> 01:48:52,671
from a spot,
right?

2428
01:48:52,671 --> 01:48:52,671
Like really?
Is that what you're telling me?

2429
01:48:52,671 --> 01:48:54,570
You wrote a small bus hooked to other 
buses.

2430
01:48:54,571 --> 01:48:59,571
They called a subway,
so suddenly I'm from New York so I can 

2431
01:48:59,571 --> 01:48:59,571
handle myself.
You know how it is,

2432
01:48:59,571 --> 01:48:59,670
right?
I'm from New York.

2433
01:49:00,140 --> 01:49:01,100
No,
I don't know.

2434
01:49:01,101 --> 01:49:03,480
I don't know what you're saying.
I thought we were trying to run a rental

2435
01:49:03,481 --> 01:49:04,080
car.
It's really.

2436
01:49:04,081 --> 01:49:05,550
That doesn't apply here.
Okay.

2437
01:49:05,551 --> 01:49:09,780
Your toughness and grown up in New York.
They're from nom nom.

2438
01:49:09,960 --> 01:49:13,220
I did my time overseas within the Bronx 
in New York.

2439
01:49:13,350 --> 01:49:17,280
I live in a city,
big city in a box.

2440
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:17,850
You know,
we,

2441
01:49:17,851 --> 01:49:20,650
we're looking at real estate the other 
day just as a goof and there was a,

2442
01:49:20,651 --> 01:49:23,970
a tiny ass shitty little apartment on 
the west side.

2443
01:49:24,650 --> 01:49:27,600
Uh,
and it was $500,000.

2444
01:49:28,030 --> 01:49:29,760
I was like,
this is offensive,

2445
01:49:29,790 --> 01:49:31,560
right?
It's one bedroom,

2446
01:49:31,710 --> 01:49:36,710
shitty little apartment.
Didn't even say how many square feet it 

2447
01:49:36,710 --> 01:49:39,561
was because it looked like it was less 
than a thousand square feet and it's 

2448
01:49:39,561 --> 01:49:42,150
half of a million dollars.
Like think about how many years it would

2449
01:49:42,151 --> 01:49:46,080
take the average person working every 
fucking day,

2450
01:49:46,350 --> 01:49:48,100
all day long,
eight hours

2451
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:50,100
a day plus commuting.
Right.

2452
01:49:50,110 --> 01:49:55,110
And then tax is taken out of it to 
scrape up enough money to buy this shit 

2453
01:49:55,110 --> 01:49:56,810
back house.
It's basically impossible.

2454
01:49:57,420 --> 01:50:00,230
It's basically the weird thing is like 
we're.

2455
01:50:00,550 --> 01:50:03,040
When we were shooting lost in 
transmission,

2456
01:50:03,041 --> 01:50:08,041
there was two different producers that 
bought houses in Atlanta where we live 

2457
01:50:08,680 --> 01:50:13,680
not to live there,
but to buy them and then rent them out 

2458
01:50:13,680 --> 01:50:16,591
because they can at least make a little 
money and grow some equity in something 

2459
01:50:16,591 --> 01:50:16,780
there.
Because out here,

2460
01:50:17,140 --> 01:50:20,350
like if people don't know to the 
dumpiest house,

2461
01:50:20,351 --> 01:50:25,351
you can find out here is still like a 
million plus unless you want to live in 

2462
01:50:25,351 --> 01:50:29,221
Palmdale and smoke crack every day.
Which if you're watching from Palmdale 

2463
01:50:29,221 --> 01:50:30,280
and you smoke crack,
I'm not singling you out.

2464
01:50:30,281 --> 01:50:35,281
I'm just making a suggestion.
I have a friend who just moved to 

2465
01:50:35,281 --> 01:50:35,281
Palmdale.
Gosh,

2466
01:50:35,281 --> 01:50:35,610
is it for dogs?

2467
01:50:35,620 --> 01:50:39,310
Just for pit bulls and she needed to 
leave some space.

2468
01:50:39,470 --> 01:50:43,260
She needed a place that accepted her 
dogs and that wasn't very much money.

2469
01:50:43,261 --> 01:50:46,070
She doesn't make a lot of money.
She moved to Palmdale is awful.

2470
01:50:46,180 --> 01:50:49,130
It's so far out there.
If you.

2471
01:50:49,170 --> 01:50:51,940
If you could move to the surface of the 
sun.

2472
01:50:52,180 --> 01:50:57,010
That's what living in Palm Dale is like.
It's the hottest place on earth and Afro

2473
01:50:57,010 --> 01:51:02,010
Man is from there because I feel like he
should know that side is not to go beat 

2474
01:51:03,641 --> 01:51:05,560
up some woman on stage.
Oh No.

2475
01:51:06,310 --> 01:51:07,510
Oh Gosh.
I'm sorry.

2476
01:51:07,580 --> 01:51:08,280
Yeah,
righty.

2477
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:10,720
Like he fucking crack some woman on 
stage.

2478
01:51:10,721 --> 01:51:15,721
He was on stage.
She came up behind him and he punched 

2479
01:51:15,721 --> 01:51:16,110
her in the face and dropped her.
Did you ever see that?

2480
01:51:16,120 --> 01:51:17,050
Didn't.
I'm not.

2481
01:51:17,051 --> 01:51:19,330
I don't wanna make it sound like I'm a 
fan of Afro Man.

2482
01:51:19,331 --> 01:51:20,800
I just know that he's from Palmdale.

2483
01:51:21,130 --> 01:51:25,210
We filmed almost every car scene from 
fear factor in Palmdale.

2484
01:51:25,370 --> 01:51:27,400
I like willow springs or somewhere like 
that.

2485
01:51:27,450 --> 01:51:32,450
Just closed down some side roads.
There's some side roads out in the 

2486
01:51:32,450 --> 01:51:33,970
desert is nothing but Joshua trees,
coyotes and shit and,

2487
01:51:34,110 --> 01:51:36,340
and we had these giant,
you know,

2488
01:51:36,341 --> 01:51:39,100
10 mile stretches row that they allow us
to close down.

2489
01:51:39,101 --> 01:51:41,020
Nobody gives a fuck right there.
Just go for it.

2490
01:51:41,080 --> 01:51:45,640
This is the video video.
You're showing second video of a chicken

2491
01:51:45,641 --> 01:51:48,050
and punched in the face.
Hit people.

2492
01:51:48,160 --> 01:51:51,930
It says you're so sweet and gentle.
I try to be nice man.

2493
01:51:51,940 --> 01:51:54,040
Shit goes wrong sometimes,
but yeah,

2494
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:59,880
some woman got behind them and she was 
like just drunk and being silly at a 

2495
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:02,080
show and just thought it was cute 
clothes on stage with him and he punched

2496
01:52:02,081 --> 01:52:03,850
her in the face and knocked her out 
cold.

2497
01:52:04,180 --> 01:52:05,920
She fell back and cracked her head.

2498
01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:10,270
I mean it was fucked up.
I was on stage and in New Hampshire at a

2499
01:52:10,271 --> 01:52:12,110
Nascar race once and I was telling 
people like,

2500
01:52:12,120 --> 01:52:13,620
all right,
thanks for coming up to the show.

2501
01:52:14,050 --> 01:52:19,050
Have a great night.
And all of a sudden I turned and there 

2502
01:52:19,050 --> 01:52:20,770
was a woman right here.
And I'm not saying like I've never had a

2503
01:52:20,771 --> 01:52:22,330
stock or anything like that.
Thank goodness.

2504
01:52:22,570 --> 01:52:27,570
But I don't know if you've ever had 
people precariously I was standing on 

2505
01:52:27,570 --> 01:52:30,721
like an eight foot tall platform,
I don't know where she came from and no 

2506
01:52:30,721 --> 01:52:35,081
one saw her and then she was just there 
in my face and a little bit drunk and 

2507
01:52:35,081 --> 01:52:39,031
definitely from New Hampshire.
I don't know if you've had those 

2508
01:52:39,031 --> 01:52:39,031
moments.
It's a real fight or flight moment where

2509
01:52:39,031 --> 01:52:39,250
you're like,
why are you,

2510
01:52:39,910 --> 01:52:44,910
why are you right here in my face and 
you're drunk and she knew my name and 

2511
01:52:44,910 --> 01:52:44,910
then you're like,
I'm just going to go.

2512
01:52:45,410 --> 01:52:45,980
This feels

2513
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:50,980
weird.
It's weird that someone would not think 

2514
01:52:50,980 --> 01:52:53,321
that you would freak out by sneaking 
behind your glasses in real limited 

2515
01:52:53,321 --> 01:52:57,941
peripheral.
So it's not like you can sneak up on me 

2516
01:52:57,941 --> 01:53:00,611
in the room that we're in.
My wife will sometimes stare at me in 

2517
01:53:00,611 --> 01:53:04,241
the car to see how long it takes me to 
notice and then she'll give up because 

2518
01:53:04,241 --> 01:53:05,150
I'm not going to see you over there.
I can't.

2519
01:53:05,151 --> 01:53:08,600
I'm not going to notice.
Little tough game with me.

2520
01:53:09,450 --> 01:53:11,000
Yeah,
there's a lot of Weirdos out there.

2521
01:53:11,001 --> 01:53:16,001
That's the thing is you never know when 
you hear about that guy that shot 

2522
01:53:16,001 --> 01:53:17,690
Darrell dimebag on stage,
you know like you never know.

2523
01:53:17,691 --> 01:53:19,310
There's.
You might be in the wrong place,

2524
01:53:19,311 --> 01:53:22,070
wrong time,
so I can understand that.

2525
01:53:22,071 --> 01:53:23,670
He'd be freaked out.
This woman was onstage,

2526
01:53:23,780 --> 01:53:28,250
but a cursory glance at her would let 
you understand,

2527
01:53:28,251 --> 01:53:33,251
oh,
there's no reason to give this woman a 

2528
01:53:33,251 --> 01:53:33,251
concussion.

2529
01:53:33,251 --> 01:53:35,240
She's just a crazy drunk lady.
You don't need to fucking molly whopper 

2530
01:53:35,240 --> 01:53:38,330
in the face.
Jesus Christ certainly am.

2531
01:53:38,350 --> 01:53:40,490
I bet they had security there too.
Like you could've,

2532
01:53:40,940 --> 01:53:44,540
could've probably had another plan of 
action.

2533
01:53:45,500 --> 01:53:50,120
They did have security shoot a never 
gotten onstage a fair point.

2534
01:53:50,330 --> 01:53:55,330
I mean the security got high because 
they were listening to a song because I 

2535
01:53:55,330 --> 01:53:58,901
got high.
Like that song is basically like I was 

2536
01:53:58,901 --> 01:53:58,901
going to do all the things I need to do,
like pay the rent,

2537
01:53:59,180 --> 01:54:01,180
pay the bills.
I was going to do some stuff and then it

2538
01:54:01,181 --> 01:54:03,310
got high.
Maybe he got hot,

2539
01:54:03,340 --> 01:54:04,790
maybe security got high.
I don't know.

2540
01:54:05,140 --> 01:54:07,600
Anything could have happened.
It's just saturation,

2541
01:54:08,390 --> 01:54:13,390
speculation.
It feels like a Monday morning 

2542
01:54:13,390 --> 01:54:13,390
quarterback here.
Riff raff happens.

2543
01:54:13,390 --> 01:54:17,570
Insecurity is onstage.
Is Fan gets tackled.

2544
01:54:17,571 --> 01:54:19,520
Oh Jesus Christ.
All right,

2545
01:54:19,521 --> 01:54:21,300
let's get.
Let's get with God.

2546
01:54:21,400 --> 01:54:23,600
Let's just through that guy in the 
crowd.

2547
01:54:23,600 --> 01:54:25,490
Riff raff.
The white rapper.

2548
01:54:25,491 --> 01:54:29,090
Let's give him some credit for making it
on Worldstar hip hop.

2549
01:54:29,270 --> 01:54:31,770
Is he white?
He is all you've seen.

2550
01:54:32,410 --> 01:54:37,410
Is that a woman that tackles what's?
Show that again,

2551
01:54:38,121 --> 01:54:40,680
because that's the power.
Double that.

2552
01:54:40,690 --> 01:54:42,710
This dude lens is quite impressive to 
watch.

2553
01:54:43,100 --> 01:54:45,280
The guy taps some.
Look at this blue.

2554
01:54:45,281 --> 01:54:47,870
Oh Gosh.
That guy probably died.

2555
01:54:49,180 --> 01:54:51,240
Throws him in the crowd to look.
He's trash.

2556
01:54:52,110 --> 01:54:57,110
Like don't they have any liability 
whatsoever to for fucking a 300 pound 

2557
01:54:57,110 --> 01:55:00,580
giant human being.
So riff Raff.

2558
01:55:00,590 --> 01:55:02,330
I've.
I've never heard of this fellow before,

2559
01:55:02,331 --> 01:55:03,860
but gosh,
he has dreadlocks.

2560
01:55:03,980 --> 01:55:08,230
Is he related to the woman from spokane?
That was the head of the Naacp to apps.

2561
01:55:08,360 --> 01:55:12,630
How crazy is that to me?
Did you ever see the movie soul man?

2562
01:55:12,631 --> 01:55:17,631
That was our babies.
You know what I love about this super 

2563
01:55:17,631 --> 01:55:17,631
progressive.
People are starting to take her side.

2564
01:55:17,750 --> 01:55:22,750
The tide has turned and they're starting
to say that race is just a social 

2565
01:55:22,750 --> 01:55:26,630
construct and I've been reading all 
these articles about how she ran circles

2566
01:55:26,631 --> 01:55:31,631
around Matt Lauer on the today show.
All these like super progressive left 

2567
01:55:31,631 --> 01:55:35,471
wing.
People who are pro transgender are now 

2568
01:55:35,471 --> 01:55:37,280
starting to accept Trans Racial.
They're not fucking around.

2569
01:55:37,281 --> 01:55:39,530
I never saw that coming.
She is running with it.

2570
01:55:39,531 --> 01:55:41,150
She's running with it.
I love it.

2571
01:55:41,300 --> 01:55:44,400
And one of the things that she said is I
as black,

2572
01:55:44,580 --> 01:55:46,420
so she's been lying about her dad like 
this.

2573
01:55:46,421 --> 01:55:48,030
The guy she hangs out with,
she calls him her dad,

2574
01:55:48,360 --> 01:55:49,980
he's black.
I just pretended to real dad.

2575
01:55:50,060 --> 01:55:52,050
Her parents are from Montana or white as
fuck.

2576
01:55:52,440 --> 01:55:54,390
They're white as fuck,
but she has.

2577
01:55:56,710 --> 01:55:58,530
She checked on her college application.
Right?

2578
01:55:58,650 --> 01:56:02,850
What's amazing about,
apparently she went to Howard University

2579
01:56:02,851 --> 01:56:07,851
and sued Howard University because sued 
for discrimination because she was 

2580
01:56:07,921 --> 01:56:10,140
white,
so she's in the lawsuit.

2581
01:56:10,141 --> 01:56:12,240
She's saying that she's white.
She's like,

2582
01:56:12,241 --> 01:56:13,680
well,
then I identified as white,

2583
01:56:14,280 --> 01:56:17,970
but I identify as black now.
Wow.

2584
01:56:18,090 --> 01:56:22,020
We live in crazy times.
Donald Trump's gonna be president.

2585
01:56:22,080 --> 01:56:23,550
No one's black.
No one's white,

2586
01:56:23,551 --> 01:56:26,370
you whatever the fuck you want to be.
You can be anything you want.

2587
01:56:26,580 --> 01:56:31,470
We live in fantasy land America.
He paid $50 to cheer for him.

2588
01:56:31,750 --> 01:56:33,000
A president.
No,

2589
01:56:33,001 --> 01:56:38,001
really?
Is that true that he offered actors $50 

2590
01:56:38,001 --> 01:56:38,001
each year from him?

2591
01:56:38,001 --> 01:56:38,850
Hey,
you can't say he's not a businessman.

2592
01:56:38,851 --> 01:56:41,700
There's a video of him pulling his hair 
back to reveal that he has a real hair.

2593
01:56:42,660 --> 01:56:46,650
No way you could see.
I love that.

2594
01:56:46,651 --> 01:56:48,480
Your fans are that.
Yeah,

2595
01:56:48,490 --> 01:56:51,060
there are two dude throwing the ball for
you,

2596
01:56:51,061 --> 01:56:54,470
so someone must have challenged him on 
his hair and he.

2597
01:56:54,480 --> 01:56:56,400
So he pulls his hair back.
Look,

2598
01:56:56,401 --> 01:56:58,740
see he's got fucking hair.
He just likes.

2599
01:56:58,741 --> 01:57:01,080
He just,
he basically just moved his bangs,

2600
01:57:01,140 --> 01:57:04,680
which shows,
but he showed his look.

2601
01:57:04,681 --> 01:57:06,760
He showed his hairline and he does his 
hair.

2602
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:09,760
It just has a wacky fucking thing with 
AOL.

2603
01:57:09,770 --> 01:57:12,030
Got Don king thing going on.
That's fucking hair,

2604
01:57:12,031 --> 01:57:12,930
man.
Okay,

2605
01:57:12,931 --> 01:57:17,931
that's weird.
There's a lot of hairspray in there and 

2606
01:57:17,931 --> 01:57:18,750
it's obviously thinning,
but you know,

2607
01:57:18,840 --> 01:57:23,840
there's nothing wrong for the record.
There's nothing wrong with losing your 

2608
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:23,840
hair.
You're talking to a bald guy.

2609
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:25,470
It looks great on you.
Thank you very much.

2610
01:57:25,500 --> 01:57:27,720
I've always said if I lose it,
I want to look like a clown.

2611
01:57:27,721 --> 01:57:32,721
I might go like just diet,
but I think when you get to be the guy 

2612
01:57:32,721 --> 01:57:33,540
like a don king or a guy like a Donald 
Trump,

2613
01:57:33,541 --> 01:57:38,541
that's sort of his look like.
They commit to that and then they start 

2614
01:57:38,541 --> 01:57:42,381
thinking that that's their lucky look 
that you kind of have to have your hair 

2615
01:57:42,381 --> 01:57:43,470
sticking straight up in the air or 
nobody's going to know it's don king.

2616
01:57:44,100 --> 01:57:45,990
Don King all sudden had cornrows.
Everybody's like,

2617
01:57:45,991 --> 01:57:48,960
get the fuck Outta here man.
You can't have cornrows.

2618
01:57:49,460 --> 01:57:54,460
You're don king.
Your shit supposed to stick out like a 

2619
01:57:54,460 --> 01:57:54,810
troll doll.
I interviewed him.

2620
01:57:55,090 --> 01:57:56,270
He said,
oh,

2621
01:57:56,271 --> 01:57:58,260
it's amazing.
I did it for the UFC.

2622
01:57:58,261 --> 01:58:00,870
It was fucking amazing.
I do some stuff.

2623
01:58:00,930 --> 01:58:03,390
He doesn't let you talk.
First of all,

2624
01:58:03,391 --> 01:58:04,840
he doesn't answer any questions.

2625
01:58:04,980 --> 01:58:08,940
You asked him a question.
The the pontification upon the universal

2626
01:58:08,941 --> 01:58:13,941
connection that we all share.
Like most of like I would ask him a 

2627
01:58:13,941 --> 01:58:14,550
question and he would bring in to 
women's rights.

2628
01:58:14,750 --> 01:58:15,900
Who would go to well,
like he's like,

2629
01:58:15,910 --> 01:58:16,980
oh,
let's go to,

2630
01:58:17,020 --> 01:58:17,640
let's not.
Yeah,

2631
01:58:17,641 --> 01:58:20,250
it was like a women's rights and gay 
rights and,

2632
01:58:20,610 --> 01:58:22,500
and uh,
it was really strange.

2633
01:58:22,530 --> 01:58:27,530
It was very strange.
It was like he just talks and they 

2634
01:58:27,530 --> 01:58:28,590
change his subjects in mid sentence and 
keeps going and going and going.

2635
01:58:28,740 --> 01:58:31,200
So like you'll ask him a question and 
you sit there for 10 minutes.

2636
01:58:31,590 --> 01:58:36,590
Like I said,
I couldn't imagine being a fucking 

2637
01:58:36,590 --> 01:58:39,051
fighter who has some issues with my 
contract to come into your office and 

2638
01:58:39,051 --> 01:58:42,421
um,
I probably have a hard time talking 

2639
01:58:42,421 --> 01:58:42,421
already.
Right?

2640
01:58:42,421 --> 01:58:42,421
I mean,
not,

2641
01:58:42,421 --> 01:58:43,540
not everybody's as eloquent as that 
fucking guy.

2642
01:58:43,870 --> 01:58:45,250
You sit in his office,
you know,

2643
01:58:45,251 --> 01:58:50,251
maybe you're a regular dude who just 
doesn't know how to phrase shit that 

2644
01:58:50,251 --> 01:58:50,251
good.

2645
01:58:50,251 --> 01:58:54,430
He sit in his office,
he asked them a question and he goes on 

2646
01:58:54,430 --> 01:58:54,430
his fucking 10 minute diatribe about,
you know,

2647
01:58:54,430 --> 01:58:56,470
Rosa Parks and women's rights and,
you know,

2648
01:58:56,471 --> 01:59:00,190
minorities and the white man.
And it just keeps going.

2649
01:59:00,191 --> 01:59:02,680
He just keeps going on and on and on.
And I was like,

2650
01:59:03,010 --> 01:59:05,230
you would,
you would confuse the fuck into people.

2651
01:59:05,350 --> 01:59:07,630
And I brought it up to them,
I kind of called them on it.

2652
01:59:07,810 --> 01:59:08,920
I was like,
you're baffling.

2653
01:59:09,160 --> 01:59:12,160
Baffling speaker.
It was weird though,

2654
01:59:12,161 --> 01:59:15,400
just knowing that first of all,
across the guy from the guy who killed a

2655
01:59:15,401 --> 01:59:16,870
couple people.
Yeah.

2656
01:59:16,900 --> 01:59:19,660
One of the worst stomped the guy to 
death for a gambling debt.

2657
01:59:20,170 --> 01:59:25,170
And uh,
one of them I think he got off on the 

2658
01:59:25,170 --> 01:59:27,901
other one he did some time for like,
one of them was like manslaughter and 

2659
01:59:27,901 --> 01:59:31,561
the other one was like justifiable 
homicide or some point that she.

2660
01:59:31,750 --> 01:59:33,300
Yeah,
that's,

2661
01:59:33,580 --> 01:59:35,080
that's a real stuff.
CLEVELAND,

2662
01:59:35,081 --> 01:59:36,460
right?
Isn't he from Cleveland,

2663
01:59:36,760 --> 01:59:39,220
Ohio in the fucking house.
Yeah.

2664
01:59:39,221 --> 01:59:42,280
Don King is a but,
but an interesting guy nonetheless.

2665
01:59:42,340 --> 01:59:44,920
Fascinating to talk to.
Covered in diamonds by the way.

2666
01:59:45,040 --> 01:59:45,790
Covered.
Yeah.

2667
01:59:45,820 --> 01:59:50,200
Diamond Star of David and cross covering
both sides just in case.

2668
01:59:50,201 --> 01:59:51,770
Just in case.
And uh,

2669
01:59:51,790 --> 01:59:54,010
he told me that late diamonds are a 
girl's best friend.

2670
01:59:54,011 --> 01:59:55,060
That's why.
Whereas diamonds,

2671
01:59:55,870 --> 01:59:58,660
diamonds and rings diamonds on his 
chains,

2672
01:59:58,661 --> 02:00:01,600
like you find yourself when you're on 
tour.

2673
02:00:01,660 --> 02:00:04,790
A lot of times when you make it back to 
a hotel room late on Saturday night,

2674
02:00:04,791 --> 02:00:08,890
that lock up is the only show on 
television that just great

2675
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:11,420
it block out some of those shows and 
when I travel,

2676
02:00:11,421 --> 02:00:16,421
especially going to nascar races,
I don't know why they're always on 

2677
02:00:16,421 --> 02:00:18,941
Saturday night and I feel like what if 
like what if these dudes were like one 

2678
02:00:18,941 --> 02:00:21,680
wrong car on the interstate away from 
just being like a normal person.

2679
02:00:21,950 --> 02:00:25,940
Then just snapped.
Now I'm watching them in a federal pen,

2680
02:00:26,210 --> 02:00:27,140
like those two.
Okay.

2681
02:00:27,141 --> 02:00:29,480
So the two dudes that got out,
you're hearing about that.

2682
02:00:29,540 --> 02:00:34,160
The do's escaped from New York.
I learned late yesterday that the reason

2683
02:00:34,161 --> 02:00:39,161
that chick helped them was because they 
told her they were gonna kill her 

2684
02:00:39,161 --> 02:00:39,161
husband.
She wanted her husband,

2685
02:00:39,161 --> 02:00:44,111
dad.
So that's why she was helping them get 

2686
02:00:44,111 --> 02:00:44,111
out because they said they would go kill
her husband.

2687
02:00:44,111 --> 02:00:44,111
Okay.

2688
02:00:44,430 --> 02:00:49,430
And then my next thought is or where 
they hooking up with her because I 

2689
02:00:49,430 --> 02:00:50,400
assume they have to.
There's gotta be some sort of weird love

2690
02:00:50,401 --> 02:00:51,090
triangle.
Right?

2691
02:00:51,150 --> 02:00:52,620
Well,
apparently the younger guy,

2692
02:00:52,650 --> 02:00:56,400
the word is he had a giant hog.
How does that come out?

2693
02:00:57,040 --> 02:00:58,170
Well,
everyone's going to want to know,

2694
02:00:58,171 --> 02:01:02,340
do you look at the girl?
She's quite the ugly duckling and uh,

2695
02:01:02,360 --> 02:01:03,510
you know,
you figure well,

2696
02:01:03,511 --> 02:01:06,690
she's inside the prison.
She probably gets to talk to these guys.

2697
02:01:06,691 --> 02:01:08,520
Probably lonely.
You know,

2698
02:01:08,550 --> 02:01:12,900
they make friends slowly but surely the 
guy works his way in shows is giant hog.

2699
02:01:13,950 --> 02:01:16,420
Suddenly she wants her husband dead.
Let me ask you question.

2700
02:01:16,430 --> 02:01:16,930
Okay.
Just,

2701
02:01:16,960 --> 02:01:18,310
just two guys talking.
Okay.

2702
02:01:18,320 --> 02:01:18,960
You ever heard,
hey,

2703
02:01:18,961 --> 02:01:20,790
there's a prison break.
And your first thought is,

2704
02:01:20,791 --> 02:01:22,380
I wonder how big this guy is downstairs.

2705
02:01:22,400 --> 02:01:26,390
There's never been.
When a woman's involved though,

2706
02:01:27,130 --> 02:01:28,670
if the woman helped him get out,
you're like,

2707
02:01:28,671 --> 02:01:29,810
well,
what did he have to offer?

2708
02:01:30,390 --> 02:01:33,660
Can fucking giant snake?
Maybe it was a great dancer.

2709
02:01:33,710 --> 02:01:38,710
Maybe we knew a lot about poetry.
And you look at her and she's just sad 

2710
02:01:38,710 --> 02:01:40,250
and unkempt

2711
02:01:40,250 --> 02:01:43,490
and neglected.
All of the above.

2712
02:01:43,540 --> 02:01:46,490
Just her whole body's just a tragedy.
You know,

2713
02:01:46,910 --> 02:01:49,610
John Mayer flaring bodies in Wonderland 
about her.

2714
02:01:49,611 --> 02:01:52,820
It is kind of a wonderland.
Wonder how the heart keeps beating.

2715
02:01:53,480 --> 02:01:56,730
She doesn't climb to the top of the 
fucking tower where they shoot prisoners

2716
02:01:56,731 --> 02:01:59,270
and jump off face first into the 
basketball court.

2717
02:01:59,960 --> 02:02:00,860
Yeah.
What keeps you going,

2718
02:02:00,861 --> 02:02:01,770
honey?
Well,

2719
02:02:01,771 --> 02:02:04,880
I was hoping this guy shoot my husband 
and give me some giant Dick.

2720
02:02:08,120 --> 02:02:10,610
What's amazing that they haven't caught 
them yet.

2721
02:02:10,640 --> 02:02:12,590
Right?
And that they're still out there.

2722
02:02:12,950 --> 02:02:17,950
What are those guys doing?
Probably they're learning French and 

2723
02:02:17,950 --> 02:02:19,900
walking into Canada.
Yeah,

2724
02:02:19,930 --> 02:02:22,100
that's what I would do if I was in 
upstate New York.

2725
02:02:22,160 --> 02:02:26,060
I would think the best way like Canada,
if you go to Lubbock,

2726
02:02:26,540 --> 02:02:27,410
um,
they're,

2727
02:02:27,440 --> 02:02:32,440
they're very divorced from American 
culture and a lot of ways in a very 

2728
02:02:32,440 --> 02:02:34,370
strange way.
Like Toronto's not like Toronto,

2729
02:02:34,371 --> 02:02:36,480
like we understand that their mayors a 
crackhead,

2730
02:02:36,500 --> 02:02:38,060
they know all about our presidents.

2731
02:02:38,240 --> 02:02:39,530
You know,
like we,

2732
02:02:39,590 --> 02:02:44,590
we,
when I go to Toronto it seems like I'm 

2733
02:02:44,590 --> 02:02:44,590
in America.
The people are nicer,

2734
02:02:44,660 --> 02:02:46,310
you know,
it's very similar to America,

2735
02:02:46,311 --> 02:02:51,311
but Montreal is not.
Montreal is a very international 

2736
02:02:51,311 --> 02:02:53,130
feeling.
City and the outside of Montreal,

2737
02:02:53,480 --> 02:02:54,830
Quebec,
like that whole area,

2738
02:02:54,831 --> 02:02:59,390
the French speaking area,
they have completely different stars.

2739
02:02:59,600 --> 02:03:02,240
They have singers that you've never 
heard of that are huge,

2740
02:03:02,241 --> 02:03:07,241
that play stadiums.
They have comedians that a lot of them 

2741
02:03:07,241 --> 02:03:08,720
would steal like English jokes and they 
would translate them into,

2742
02:03:08,900 --> 02:03:13,900
into French and they would go on tour 
throughout the French speaking areas and

2743
02:03:14,781 --> 02:03:19,781
do their comedy routines and they have 
like a whole different world.

2744
02:03:19,821 --> 02:03:24,821
They speak French,
they like a lot of them exclusively 

2745
02:03:24,821 --> 02:03:27,910
speak French and a lot of the areas like
you have to have French on the signs of 

2746
02:03:27,921 --> 02:03:29,910
the buildings.
Like you know when you go to Montreal,

2747
02:03:29,911 --> 02:03:30,980
like everything's in French.

2748
02:03:31,250 --> 02:03:34,280
Like even Kentucky Fried Chicken,
they don't have KFC.

2749
02:03:34,490 --> 02:03:37,820
It's Pfc.
it's pooled a fried chicken,

2750
02:03:38,510 --> 02:03:41,000
you know,
it's probably not do well.

2751
02:03:41,010 --> 02:03:43,880
There's no way you'd learn French,
you know,

2752
02:03:44,120 --> 02:03:49,120
they're lovely people.
I mean I guess if I had broken out of 

2753
02:03:49,120 --> 02:03:49,120
prison,
yeah,

2754
02:03:49,120 --> 02:03:49,120
I would think that that would be the 
move though.

2755
02:03:49,120 --> 02:03:53,561
You go up there,
you learn French and a French on tape,

2756
02:03:54,140 --> 02:03:57,920
but you think they have Rosetta stone 
when you've escaped from prison.

2757
02:03:58,190 --> 02:04:01,730
I bet you could learn in prison and I 
bet if the guy was learning French,

2758
02:04:01,731 --> 02:04:04,560
they would say,
motherfucker is probably learning,

2759
02:04:04,640 --> 02:04:09,640
so you're going to escape to Quebec.
He's talking to his new girlfriend who 

2760
02:04:09,640 --> 02:04:09,640
hates her husband.
He's like,

2761
02:04:09,640 --> 02:04:14,561
hey,
why don't you Rosetta stone me some 

2762
02:04:14,561 --> 02:04:16,190
fringe me and Tommy will get out.
I'll take care of your husband.

2763
02:04:16,320 --> 02:04:20,900
Little Walkman or something.
We'll meet in in French speaking Canada.

2764
02:04:21,140 --> 02:04:23,800
How much could you really learn from one
of those Rosetta stone thing?

2765
02:04:23,801 --> 02:04:27,740
So I mean to really learn a language.
It seems like it's a long process.

2766
02:04:27,760 --> 02:04:29,120
I don't think.
It doesn't seem that way.

2767
02:04:29,330 --> 02:04:34,330
Do you know anything you want to speak 
and I know a tiny bit of Spanish took 

2768
02:04:34,330 --> 02:04:36,500
two years dose on Ios.
I took two years of Italian.

2769
02:04:36,501 --> 02:04:38,450
I don't know a word of it anymore.

2770
02:04:39,180 --> 02:04:41,310
Not sitting there.
That's a nice language though.

2771
02:04:42,260 --> 02:04:45,330
I just don't understand it at all.
I didn't pay attention.

2772
02:04:45,390 --> 02:04:49,450
I've had trouble with this language that
we're speaking clearly enough,

2773
02:04:49,890 --> 02:04:52,050
enough hurdles.
They're speaking to English.

2774
02:04:52,550 --> 02:04:54,380
I'm the tra.
Wow.

2775
02:04:54,381 --> 02:04:59,381
That would be a mess if I talked to you 
and didn't talk about the Jeremy 

2776
02:04:59,381 --> 02:04:59,520
Clarkson tragedy.
Oh sure.

2777
02:05:00,900 --> 02:05:01,660
Because,
uh,

2778
02:05:01,710 --> 02:05:04,170
the real top gear,
original top gear rather.

2779
02:05:04,171 --> 02:05:08,410
I'm in England,
which was a Jeremy Clarkson,

2780
02:05:08,520 --> 02:05:11,260
Richard May.
And I'm James Madison,

2781
02:05:11,300 --> 02:05:12,810
James,
Richard Hamill,

2782
02:05:13,080 --> 02:05:13,770
Hammond,
Hammond,

2783
02:05:13,771 --> 02:05:15,150
Hammond,
they call the hamster.

2784
02:05:15,180 --> 02:05:15,870
Yeah.
Sweet.

2785
02:05:16,560 --> 02:05:19,440
Hilarious folks there.
Nice work together.

2786
02:05:19,980 --> 02:05:21,720
And that's a tough act to follow,
right?

2787
02:05:21,721 --> 02:05:24,990
I mean it's a long running show that 
went on for decades,

2788
02:05:25,230 --> 02:05:27,750
the most popular international show I 
think,

2789
02:05:28,080 --> 02:05:28,470
isn't it?

2790
02:05:28,500 --> 02:05:33,500
Yeah.
And they said it was the most viewed 

2791
02:05:33,500 --> 02:05:33,500
show in the world.
Um,

2792
02:05:33,500 --> 02:05:38,010
when you looked at CBS Sunday morning,
did an awesome kind of a no 60 minutes.

2793
02:05:38,011 --> 02:05:40,830
I'm sorry,
60 minutes was talking about it based on

2794
02:05:40,831 --> 02:05:43,260
downloads,
both legal and illegal.

2795
02:05:43,650 --> 02:05:47,490
And then how many shows how many 
countries does show airs in like our top

2796
02:05:47,491 --> 02:05:49,080
gear USA or something like a hundred 
countries.

2797
02:05:49,081 --> 02:05:52,800
There isn't like 170.
Um,

2798
02:05:53,100 --> 02:05:54,950
so yeah,
it's a big huge.

2799
02:05:54,960 --> 02:05:57,120
Can you kind of hinted to it before 
about like,

2800
02:05:57,180 --> 02:05:58,800
you know,
it's a big act to follow.

2801
02:05:58,801 --> 02:06:03,801
We knew when we got ours that we 
couldn't pretend to be the three of 

2802
02:06:03,801 --> 02:06:04,650
those.
We were never gonna do that.

2803
02:06:04,651 --> 02:06:06,090
We're going to have to be our three 
guys.

2804
02:06:06,570 --> 02:06:08,540
Um,
and we knew that there's like,

2805
02:06:08,550 --> 02:06:13,550
there's this like kind of core group,
we call them UK fan boys and they got 

2806
02:06:13,550 --> 02:06:18,051
really upset that we were doing an 
American version because they felt like 

2807
02:06:18,051 --> 02:06:19,740
they were the only ones that knew about 
the UK show,

2808
02:06:20,190 --> 02:06:22,560
not realizing how many people around the
world saw it.

2809
02:06:22,590 --> 02:06:24,930
They felt like,
I've got this special like Unicorn.

2810
02:06:24,931 --> 02:06:26,610
No one knows about.
I'm super awesome.

2811
02:06:26,970 --> 02:06:31,970
Well,
it turns out we were just taking the 

2812
02:06:31,970 --> 02:06:33,330
kind of foundation of it and it's three 
people in cars,

2813
02:06:33,331 --> 02:06:35,130
right?
So we're going to go do our own thing.

2814
02:06:35,310 --> 02:06:40,310
We,
we started with some of the same 

2815
02:06:40,310 --> 02:06:40,310
fundamental ideas,
did everything different.

2816
02:06:40,310 --> 02:06:42,900
We didn't like our producers would come 
up with crazy things for us to do,

2817
02:06:42,901 --> 02:06:47,901
but we didn't know about them.
Like we just went and they wanted to 

2818
02:06:47,901 --> 02:06:50,691
watch us squirm and go have fun.
But what's happening now is a announced 

2819
02:06:50,940 --> 02:06:52,890
a today.
I think Chris,

2820
02:06:52,891 --> 02:06:54,600
is it Chris Evans?
The guy's name,

2821
02:06:54,601 --> 02:06:58,590
who I guess is like a morning host or 
their show or dj or something,

2822
02:06:59,170 --> 02:07:03,930
a popular guy is going to be the new 
host of top gear UK,

2823
02:07:03,931 --> 02:07:06,360
which would,
they will relaunch and kind of re.

2824
02:07:06,361 --> 02:07:11,361
I'm not saying they'll reformat.
I assume he's going to have two people 

2825
02:07:11,361 --> 02:07:11,361
with him,
sort of a rebirth.

2826
02:07:11,361 --> 02:07:13,450
So James May is not going to be on 
anymore.

2827
02:07:13,500 --> 02:07:15,620
Correct?
Correct.

2828
02:07:16,780 --> 02:07:17,020
I think

2829
02:07:17,020 --> 02:07:21,640
the two of them said we will stand with 
Clarkson and this is our group.

2830
02:07:21,641 --> 02:07:26,641
This is what top gear is to us.
So when everything went down,

2831
02:07:27,820 --> 02:07:29,980
um,
and I've never met Clarkson,

2832
02:07:29,981 --> 02:07:33,040
I've only met Hammon and uh,
he and I are pals.

2833
02:07:33,041 --> 02:07:34,840
Really great guy.
Uh,

2834
02:07:34,980 --> 02:07:39,980
I think it's one of those things where 
he had gotten in so much trouble before 

2835
02:07:39,980 --> 02:07:40,300
over the things he had said,
which is also like,

2836
02:07:40,301 --> 02:07:42,550
it's weird because that's the same 
reason people watch him.

2837
02:07:42,580 --> 02:07:43,450
Yeah.
You know,

2838
02:07:43,451 --> 02:07:46,060
it's like when comedians get in trouble 
for being funny.

2839
02:07:46,061 --> 02:07:47,710
You're right.
But that's what you wanted.

2840
02:07:48,070 --> 02:07:51,010
So I'm not making any kind of excuse for
that,

2841
02:07:51,011 --> 02:07:53,930
but I think it's a real bummer what 
happened.

2842
02:07:53,931 --> 02:07:55,360
And you know,
everybody has bad days,

2843
02:07:55,361 --> 02:07:57,520
but when he flipped out,
flipped out on this producer,

2844
02:07:57,521 --> 02:07:59,290
who's a great guy,
I've met him before.

2845
02:08:00,410 --> 02:08:05,410
Ah,
apparently they'd had like a long day 

2846
02:08:05,410 --> 02:08:05,800
and there were some sort of dispute,
excuse me,

2847
02:08:05,801 --> 02:08:09,070
about dinner or whether something should
be cold.

2848
02:08:09,130 --> 02:08:12,370
There was cold cuts instead of like a 
hot steak or something.

2849
02:08:12,371 --> 02:08:17,020
I wasn't there and no one talks about it
in our lab group.

2850
02:08:17,021 --> 02:08:20,200
Everyone's very sensitive because I 
didn't know whether overnight that would

2851
02:08:20,201 --> 02:08:22,860
screw up our show because it worldwide 
brand is,

2852
02:08:22,890 --> 02:08:25,210
it's very important to,
to everybody.

2853
02:08:25,211 --> 02:08:29,800
That's a part of it.
And so I think,

2854
02:08:30,130 --> 02:08:35,130
I think he just had a real bad evening 
and he took it out on somebody and that 

2855
02:08:35,130 --> 02:08:37,570
cost him his job.
And so did he beat the guy up?

2856
02:08:37,571 --> 02:08:39,070
Is that what he did?
I think so.

2857
02:08:39,340 --> 02:08:44,340
I think he punched him.
I don't know if he beat him up and seem 

2858
02:08:44,340 --> 02:08:45,790
like when you watch that show and you 
watch that guy,

2859
02:08:45,791 --> 02:08:47,740
he's like this fun loving.
Right.

2860
02:08:47,741 --> 02:08:52,741
Hilarious dude.
I just have a hard time seeing him 

2861
02:08:52,741 --> 02:08:52,830
beating somebody up.
Yeah,

2862
02:08:52,850 --> 02:08:53,860
I don't.
I don't know.

2863
02:08:53,870 --> 02:08:58,870
I mean,
I just read the same stuff everybody 

2864
02:08:58,870 --> 02:08:58,870
else did that.

2865
02:08:58,870 --> 02:09:01,110
There were some sort of verbal 
altercation and then a physical 

2866
02:09:01,110 --> 02:09:02,170
altercation.
I don't know what that means.

2867
02:09:02,171 --> 02:09:07,171
I know it's a bummer for everybody that 
was involved because it's certainly not 

2868
02:09:07,171 --> 02:09:11,071
something that.
I mean he obviously was very upset in 

2869
02:09:11,071 --> 02:09:12,550
the shame that happen as well as a 
producer.

2870
02:09:12,551 --> 02:09:17,551
Everybody else.
It just wasn't one of those things that 

2871
02:09:17,551 --> 02:09:19,231
happens sometimes and you realize it 
sucks for every single person involved I

2872
02:09:20,171 --> 02:09:24,160
think because all the things he had been
in trouble for four before that.

2873
02:09:24,330 --> 02:09:28,360
What are the retarded or they not 
understand what's going on and there's a

2874
02:09:28,361 --> 02:09:33,361
reason why the show is popular and it's 
because that guy is a very unique and 

2875
02:09:33,361 --> 02:09:37,291
bizarre character.
That is the main reason that shows 

2876
02:09:37,291 --> 02:09:38,920
popular is Jeremy Clarkson in Richard 
Hammond is grade and James May is great,

2877
02:09:38,921 --> 02:09:40,750
but on their own they're starving to 
death.

2878
02:09:40,751 --> 02:09:41,890
Let's be honest.
It's a.

2879
02:09:41,890 --> 02:09:43,380
it's a.
it's an Altima.

2880
02:09:43,600 --> 02:09:44,490
I'm rude.
It's,

2881
02:09:44,630 --> 02:09:45,850
it's a.
it's a group.

2882
02:09:46,060 --> 02:09:48,550
It is an ensemble,
but Jeremy Clarkson is the funny one.

2883
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:52,480
Just like the heart and so like he,
he wrote a ton of the different,

2884
02:09:52,481 --> 02:09:55,150
you know,
because he from the journalist side,

2885
02:09:55,151 --> 02:09:55,780
you know,
right.

2886
02:09:55,790 --> 02:09:59,470
So much about the stuff that they do and
a porsche people hate him.

2887
02:09:59,920 --> 02:10:04,920
There's a lot of people from the 
manufacturers that don't like and which 

2888
02:10:04,920 --> 02:10:09,331
is funny because sometimes people 
wouldn't want to loan us cars because 

2889
02:10:09,331 --> 02:10:10,270
things that they had done will the 
Chrysler,

2890
02:10:10,450 --> 02:10:12,550
remember they had those three cars,
they drove costs in America.

2891
02:10:12,551 --> 02:10:15,790
Chrysler didn't want to give them raw 
challenger so they bought one.

2892
02:10:15,791 --> 02:10:18,350
So the black friend was a producer that 
had to pay for it,

2893
02:10:18,960 --> 02:10:19,750
pay them back.
And then.

2894
02:10:19,751 --> 02:10:21,440
So yeah,
like that's hilarious.

2895
02:10:21,600 --> 02:10:26,050
Things like that that would happen.
Richard Hanna was actually very funny.

2896
02:10:26,050 --> 02:10:28,300
I'm just fucking around saying that they
would both starve to death.

2897
02:10:28,301 --> 02:10:33,301
They're good together,
but they're better with him like as a 

2898
02:10:33,301 --> 02:10:34,400
threesome.
So are they going to try to launch a new

2899
02:10:34,401 --> 02:10:35,680
show?
The three of them together?

2900
02:10:35,690 --> 02:10:37,970
So what I heard they have to.
Yeah,

2901
02:10:37,971 --> 02:10:39,920
I know the name is not important.
Right.

2902
02:10:40,130 --> 02:10:43,430
And so right now they're doing a,
they would go and do these kinds of live

2903
02:10:43,431 --> 02:10:45,140
show events.
I've never done one here.

2904
02:10:45,470 --> 02:10:47,900
They wanted to do on with us and them 
kind of a combo thing.

2905
02:10:47,901 --> 02:10:49,940
And then we never,
nobody really moved on it.

2906
02:10:49,941 --> 02:10:54,941
But they were in [inaudible].
Ken Block was helping them out in South 

2907
02:10:54,941 --> 02:10:59,170
Africa this week.
They did like six shows and they're 

2908
02:10:59,170 --> 02:10:59,810
calling it like a Clarkson Hammond may 
live or something because they can't use

2909
02:10:59,811 --> 02:11:00,770
the name.
Oh,

2910
02:11:00,771 --> 02:11:02,050
that's hilarious.
Gear live.

2911
02:11:02,260 --> 02:11:07,260
Right.
So I hope they'll keep doing something 

2912
02:11:07,260 --> 02:11:07,260
fun together.

2913
02:11:07,260 --> 02:11:07,490
They're funny guys.
Yeah,

2914
02:11:07,570 --> 02:11:10,770
they're great together.
Hammons got a sweet Mustang.

2915
02:11:10,810 --> 02:11:13,370
We've seen some.
He's got some killer toys.

2916
02:11:13,371 --> 02:11:15,920
He's a helicopter guy too.
He lives in a castle.

2917
02:11:16,040 --> 02:11:18,260
I'm sure.
How much money they make off that show.

2918
02:11:18,650 --> 02:11:23,650
I think they did pretty well.
Maybe they got just a hair more than we 

2919
02:11:23,650 --> 02:11:24,800
have.
Says the guy with two other jobs.

2920
02:11:24,860 --> 02:11:25,850
Uh,
yeah,

2921
02:11:25,851 --> 02:11:26,840
they,
they,

2922
02:11:26,900 --> 02:11:31,900
he lives way out far somewhere,
which I think is also why he has a 

2923
02:11:31,900 --> 02:11:32,240
helicopter.
But Hayman's got a bunch of kids.

2924
02:11:32,241 --> 02:11:34,280
Shows that he produces.
Really?

2925
02:11:34,281 --> 02:11:36,350
Yeah.
So he's got like kind of his other thing

2926
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:42,000
and I don't,
I don't know what may does the rest of 

2927
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:42,380
the time when they're not makes you two 
videos,

2928
02:11:42,730 --> 02:11:45,530
a lot of youtube videos and being 
unemployed and cooking,

2929
02:11:45,590 --> 02:11:47,650
which are funny.
But they'll and recorder.

2930
02:11:47,730 --> 02:11:52,730
Yeah,
like really talented musician 

2931
02:11:52,730 --> 02:11:52,730
apparently.
But those guys,

2932
02:11:52,730 --> 02:11:55,310
it's we got to do when they were 
launching our show over there,

2933
02:11:55,640 --> 02:12:00,640
we got to go to this like a British,
I'm kind of television thing where they 

2934
02:12:00,640 --> 02:12:04,571
put us up and,
and they had this party like top gear 

2935
02:12:04,571 --> 02:12:04,571
USA.

2936
02:12:04,571 --> 02:12:06,260
So they tried to make the most American 
themed evening they could.

2937
02:12:06,680 --> 02:12:09,830
So there's glass coke bottles on every 
table.

2938
02:12:10,120 --> 02:12:11,540
Uh,
in Jack Daniel's.

2939
02:12:12,110 --> 02:12:17,110
And then the girls,
they had girls in like daisy dukes with 

2940
02:12:17,110 --> 02:12:17,810
cowboy boots and American flag Bandana.
Amazon.

2941
02:12:17,840 --> 02:12:21,140
And they had like a holster with Jack 
Daniels and shot glasses.

2942
02:12:21,980 --> 02:12:24,390
That's hilarious.
That was a fun time.

2943
02:12:25,250 --> 02:12:30,250
Fun Time.
Tanner I think was single at the time 

2944
02:12:30,250 --> 02:12:33,071
and I'm a pretty good wing man because 
my wife loves me so I can just be an 

2945
02:12:33,071 --> 02:12:34,250
idiot publicly and not worry about it.
So the whole time I was like,

2946
02:12:34,251 --> 02:12:36,530
you guys know that's,
that's tanner foust over there.

2947
02:12:36,890 --> 02:12:41,890
You know,
he's got a couple couple gold medals 

2948
02:12:41,890 --> 02:12:41,890
from x games.
I don't know if they have it all here.

2949
02:12:42,740 --> 02:12:47,690
Yeah,
well it's like a casio g shock.

2950
02:12:47,840 --> 02:12:51,380
They dipped in gold chrome.
That's not true.

2951
02:12:51,381 --> 02:12:52,820
I don't,
I don't know that for sure.

2952
02:12:52,820 --> 02:12:57,820
But I have experience in taking over a 
show that was a big love show because I 

2953
02:12:57,820 --> 02:12:58,280
took over the man show for a couple 
years.

2954
02:12:58,360 --> 02:13:02,010
I hope we got tortured like right out of
look.

2955
02:13:02,050 --> 02:13:07,050
Rightly so.
In a lot of ways it was kind of a 

2956
02:13:07,050 --> 02:13:07,050
disaster.
The show wasn't what we wanted it to be.

2957
02:13:07,240 --> 02:13:08,300
Fun.
Funny.

2958
02:13:08,430 --> 02:13:12,290
We got fucked over because we came in 
under false pretenses.

2959
02:13:12,291 --> 02:13:14,680
They Kinda told us that they were going 
to make this wild show,

2960
02:13:14,681 --> 02:13:15,650
you know,
have nudity,

2961
02:13:15,651 --> 02:13:17,480
will blurt out,
swear will beep it out.

2962
02:13:17,600 --> 02:13:19,070
We want to get sued.
We're crazy.

2963
02:13:19,280 --> 02:13:23,450
And then right when we started doing it,
Janet Jackson pulled her nipple out.

2964
02:13:23,451 --> 02:13:24,800
Oh,
this the superbowl.

2965
02:13:24,830 --> 02:13:26,180
Jt?
Yeah.

2966
02:13:26,750 --> 02:13:31,750
Slipped.
The plan says not amazing that that 

2967
02:13:31,750 --> 02:13:31,750
generated this.
Still to this day

2968
02:13:32,850 --> 02:13:37,850
just hurts my brain that everybody got 
so upset that they saw nipple on 

2969
02:13:37,850 --> 02:13:37,850
television.
Right.

2970
02:13:38,400 --> 02:13:41,040
I quite enjoyed the show,
but just doesn't make any sense.

2971
02:13:41,041 --> 02:13:43,140
Like it was a man's nipple.
No one would care.

2972
02:13:43,440 --> 02:13:46,320
But it's Janet Jackson's nipple.
She's how man.

2973
02:13:46,490 --> 02:13:48,960
Like,
it's still just the nipple live in tyler

2974
02:13:48,961 --> 02:13:53,961
showed his nipple on that.
Probably every time they did a halftime 

2975
02:13:53,961 --> 02:13:53,961
show.
So what's the big deal?

2976
02:13:53,990 --> 02:13:55,770
Yeah,
I mean it's because it's a female.

2977
02:13:55,771 --> 02:13:58,620
It's a sexual thing.
Poor Justin timberlake.

2978
02:13:58,780 --> 02:14:00,600
Heck,
I didn't even know that was gonna happen

2979
02:14:00,610 --> 02:14:01,590
y'all.
I was like,

2980
02:14:01,830 --> 02:14:06,830
he pulled it.
He pulled the nipple a pulled her 

2981
02:14:06,830 --> 02:14:06,830
closer.
He knew what the fuck is going on here.

2982
02:14:06,830 --> 02:14:09,600
But how weird is it that a nipple is 
like for a woman?

2983
02:14:09,990 --> 02:14:13,230
It's like super taboo for a dude is 
nothing.

2984
02:14:13,260 --> 02:14:16,310
No problem in that strange.
He,

2985
02:14:16,430 --> 02:14:21,430
uh,
my friend Ari Shaffir lives in New York 

2986
02:14:21,430 --> 02:14:21,840
City during the summertime and he takes 
his shirt off every day of the week,

2987
02:14:21,870 --> 02:14:26,870
just walks down the street with his 
shirt off because they have laws in New 

2988
02:14:26,870 --> 02:14:26,870
York.
You're allowed to do that.

2989
02:14:26,870 --> 02:14:28,890
But because they have laws like that,
they have,

2990
02:14:28,920 --> 02:14:33,920
they can't sexually discriminated,
so women are allowed to take their 

2991
02:14:33,920 --> 02:14:37,041
shirts off too,
so women could walk down the street 

2992
02:14:37,041 --> 02:14:38,720
topless and occasionally they do.
And there's like this naked cowgirl,

2993
02:14:38,770 --> 02:14:40,140
you know,
have that naked cowboy.

2994
02:14:40,450 --> 02:14:41,850
I was him for Halloween one year.

2995
02:14:44,650 --> 02:14:45,600
I was.
It was tough.

2996
02:14:45,601 --> 02:14:50,601
It was tough costume.
It was cold that year were built 

2997
02:14:50,601 --> 02:14:53,931
slightly differently.
He's a hands on me and the naked cowboy 

2998
02:14:53,931 --> 02:14:54,180
built fella.
He's a strong businessman to.

2999
02:14:54,190 --> 02:14:56,650
It makes a lot of money off the shit.
Let's do him.

3000
02:14:56,830 --> 02:14:59,340
He's suing this woman because she was 
doing the exact same act.

3001
02:14:59,430 --> 02:15:01,700
She was the naked cowboy.
She's topless.

3002
02:15:01,770 --> 02:15:04,620
There is the naked cow girl.
Good for her.

3003
02:15:04,621 --> 02:15:09,621
This is a different one I think.
I think there's more than one naked 

3004
02:15:09,621 --> 02:15:12,171
cowboy for her,
but she has to have [inaudible] that 

3005
02:15:12,171 --> 02:15:12,880
they deal because in Manhattan like you 
don't.

3006
02:15:12,881 --> 02:15:17,881
I'm pretty sure the law is that a woman 
can walk down the street naked or 

3007
02:15:18,060 --> 02:15:21,000
whether top out rather.
You can't have your vagina out,

3008
02:15:21,320 --> 02:15:25,160
but you could have your nipples out 
because man can just want to.

3009
02:15:25,161 --> 02:15:25,430
We're,
we're,

3010
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:26,730
we're,
we're fucking so strange.

3011
02:15:26,840 --> 02:15:28,680
Great law though.
Good for them.

3012
02:15:28,790 --> 02:15:30,280
You know,
be quality.

3013
02:15:30,360 --> 02:15:31,680
Yeah,
topless.

3014
02:15:31,681 --> 02:15:33,570
All around.
I say go for it.

3015
02:15:33,600 --> 02:15:34,830
Why not?
It's just nipples.

3016
02:15:35,200 --> 02:15:40,200
Like if it wasn't,
it was something that the whole idea of 

3017
02:15:40,200 --> 02:15:40,200
clothes,
it's just preposterous.

3018
02:15:40,200 --> 02:15:41,490
You don't want to wear them.
I don't give a fuck as long as you don't

3019
02:15:41,491 --> 02:15:44,370
rub your Dick on anybody or get weird,
who cares?

3020
02:15:44,460 --> 02:15:45,420
You know?
Suns out,

3021
02:15:45,421 --> 02:15:46,950
guns out.
You're fucking.

3022
02:15:46,951 --> 02:15:48,630
Your kid freaks out.
You gotta explain to them.

3023
02:15:48,660 --> 02:15:50,560
You get some talking to that little guy.
Say,

3024
02:15:50,630 --> 02:15:52,180
hey look buddy,
this is a.

3025
02:15:52,410 --> 02:15:57,410
Some people are freaks.
They like weird shit and they want you 

3026
02:15:57,410 --> 02:15:57,410
to look at their Dick.
Okay.

3027
02:15:57,410 --> 02:15:58,650
You don't have to look at it.
They're not going to force you it.

3028
02:15:58,651 --> 02:16:03,651
Sometimes your parents are going to take
you to the worst raggedy Ann and Andy 

3029
02:16:03,651 --> 02:16:05,360
Parade you'll ever see and you need to 
not shout that afterwards.

3030
02:16:05,450 --> 02:16:07,170
Exactly.
Some checks and balances.

3031
02:16:07,171 --> 02:16:10,130
Sometimes shit gets weird.
Also,

3032
02:16:10,230 --> 02:16:13,110
big foot's not real and that is not 
black.

3033
02:16:13,800 --> 02:16:15,690
She's white,
but she identifies as black,

3034
02:16:15,720 --> 02:16:20,720
so he's just wearing a lot man.
He used to be a man he wanted to Cathal 

3035
02:16:20,720 --> 02:16:23,130
on in the Olympics and he had children 
and then decided to use a woman.

3036
02:16:23,370 --> 02:16:25,260
So now we have to call Caitlin.
Hey,

3037
02:16:25,650 --> 02:16:26,830
smoke them if you've got them.

3038
02:16:28,890 --> 02:16:31,190
It's an interesting thing when you have 
to win,

3039
02:16:31,250 --> 02:16:32,590
when you have to make sure everybody 
knows,

3040
02:16:32,591 --> 02:16:34,420
look,
everybody's got a right to be happy,

3041
02:16:34,720 --> 02:16:38,500
but everybody does not have a right to 
be completely out of their mind.

3042
02:16:38,520 --> 02:16:42,100
Crazy.
Somewhere we will find that line.

3043
02:16:42,750 --> 02:16:45,580
I say,
you do have a right to be completely out

3044
02:16:45,581 --> 02:16:50,581
of your mind.
Crazy as long as it doesn't interfere 

3045
02:16:50,581 --> 02:16:53,611
with someone else's happiness.
Like say if your neighbor and you're 

3046
02:16:53,611 --> 02:16:57,481
completely out of your mind crazy and 
you're like sticking fireworks up your 

3047
02:16:57,481 --> 02:16:58,690
ass and doing cartwheels,
but you live in a dry area and you could

3048
02:16:58,691 --> 02:17:01,540
potentially start fires,
right?

3049
02:17:02,400 --> 02:17:04,380
Then.
This is all logical,

3050
02:17:04,470 --> 02:17:06,790
fantastic analogy.
Your,

3051
02:17:06,890 --> 02:17:09,730
your craziness is interfering with 
people's health and safety.

3052
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:10,600
So,
uh,

3053
02:17:10,601 --> 02:17:13,360
I would say that guy know that guy 
can't,

3054
02:17:13,450 --> 02:17:15,690
he can't be that crazy.
That's too crazy like that.

3055
02:17:15,691 --> 02:17:18,130
The guy with fireworks up was totally 
cool.

3056
02:17:18,640 --> 02:17:19,630
Listen,
is this a,

3057
02:17:19,631 --> 02:17:22,520
is this a burn sensitive area?
Not Cool Pal.

3058
02:17:23,110 --> 02:17:25,120
This is California.
We have a drought going on right now.

3059
02:17:25,121 --> 02:17:30,121
Man is really interesting.
They're paying people in California to 

3060
02:17:30,371 --> 02:17:33,850
take out their lawns and putting what 
they call hardscape.

3061
02:17:34,060 --> 02:17:39,060
They give you money and you put like 
rocks and Cactus in grass.

3062
02:17:39,281 --> 02:17:41,010
You can vacuum.
Yeah,

3063
02:17:41,011 --> 02:17:42,550
I've seen that.
The plastic turf.

3064
02:17:42,610 --> 02:17:47,610
I've drove down the street the other day
and there was a sign up from work for a 

3065
02:17:47,610 --> 02:17:51,121
company that does again,
are they calling it hardscape as though 

3066
02:17:51,121 --> 02:17:51,250
they're calling it like tax rebates and 
whatnot for it too?

3067
02:17:51,310 --> 02:17:56,310
I think they actually give you money.
I think that they find out about that 

3068
02:17:56,310 --> 02:17:57,060
because uh,
me and you're interested,

3069
02:17:57,360 --> 02:17:58,120
you know,
I'm thinking about.

3070
02:17:58,310 --> 02:18:00,220
No,
you've had enough of grass and bushes.

3071
02:18:00,280 --> 02:18:00,940
Well,
you know what,

3072
02:18:00,941 --> 02:18:03,340
I fucking passed by A.
Was it pepperdine?

3073
02:18:03,340 --> 02:18:05,090
Whatever.
The ones in Malibu is nice.

3074
02:18:05,160 --> 02:18:09,970
That is a God damn enormous lawn 
watering for Jesus.

3075
02:18:10,330 --> 02:18:15,330
It's a big religious college roll down 
that hill before it's fun for top gear.

3076
02:18:15,460 --> 02:18:20,460
No,
I think it was just for fun with my 

3077
02:18:20,460 --> 02:18:22,740
family.
That was shooting a commercial for a lot

3078
02:18:22,750 --> 02:18:25,420
of fucking water to use on that gun.
Nice grass.

3079
02:18:25,421 --> 02:18:28,640
If they're listening,
so Kudos will not be taxed.

3080
02:18:29,050 --> 02:18:31,720
You cannot be taxed a not being taxed on
that rebate,

3081
02:18:31,721 --> 02:18:36,721
which can range as much as $3,000.
So you get a free three grand.

3082
02:18:37,510 --> 02:18:40,660
No saying they just won't tax you on the
three grand.

3083
02:18:41,160 --> 02:18:44,230
Is that what you said?
Like no,

3084
02:18:44,231 --> 02:18:46,570
because you get a rebate,
you get a rebate,

3085
02:18:46,571 --> 02:18:48,790
you get money and then you can't be 
taxed on the money.

3086
02:18:48,791 --> 02:18:49,700
I think was when he started,
right?

3087
02:18:50,470 --> 02:18:55,470
Rebates received by homeowners replacing
their lungs with drought tolerant 

3088
02:18:55,470 --> 02:18:55,470
landscaping would not be counted as 
income,

3089
02:18:55,510 --> 02:18:56,920
so it doesn't say exactly how much 
should probably,

3090
02:18:57,100 --> 02:18:59,050
depending on how much land have 
insights.

3091
02:18:59,170 --> 02:19:04,170
That makes sense,
but the thing that's fucked his golf 

3092
02:19:04,170 --> 02:19:04,320
courses,
I mean that that is.

3093
02:19:04,930 --> 02:19:06,520
I get that.
You like to play golf.

3094
02:19:06,521 --> 02:19:09,430
I like to play pool.
I understand I get get addictions,

3095
02:19:09,880 --> 02:19:14,880
but your addiction is using up a lot of 
fucking water and apparently in some 

3096
02:19:15,910 --> 02:19:20,910
Middle Eastern countries they play a 
version of Golf on oiled sand sand and 

3097
02:19:23,381 --> 02:19:28,381
they put some sort of oil on the sand 
and the way the ball reacts is very 

3098
02:19:28,381 --> 02:19:30,890
similar to the way a ball would react on
grass.

3099
02:19:31,100 --> 02:19:33,230
See if you could find that.
Someone was just.

3100
02:19:33,240 --> 02:19:36,320
Explain that to me the other day.
I never bothered looking it up.

3101
02:19:36,680 --> 02:19:40,550
I just said it sounds like a great idea.
Well,

3102
02:19:40,610 --> 02:19:43,370
except allow those assholes,
like those divots,

3103
02:19:43,670 --> 02:19:47,870
those big chunks of grass that go flying
through the air and then what?

3104
02:19:47,871 --> 02:19:49,010
Yeah,
he didn't want this.

3105
02:19:49,070 --> 02:19:51,740
Is this it?
Okay.

3106
02:19:51,860 --> 02:19:56,120
Just disgusting.
Be a tough place to where a lot of white

3107
02:19:56,121 --> 02:19:57,070
colors.
Weird.

3108
02:19:57,390 --> 02:20:02,390
Well,
where do golf bluestones what does that 

3109
02:20:02,390 --> 02:20:05,111
say?
Grassland Greens used motor oil to make 

3110
02:20:05,111 --> 02:20:05,930
putting possible.
Huh?

3111
02:20:06,380 --> 02:20:07,740
Whoa.
There's no.

3112
02:20:07,750 --> 02:20:12,750
I've been to a lot of tracks that will 
use a motor oil from all the tractors 

3113
02:20:13,611 --> 02:20:17,780
and stuff to put it on top of gravel to 
basically like keep dust down.

3114
02:20:18,170 --> 02:20:21,230
So it's like that idea magnified.
I guess,

3115
02:20:22,010 --> 02:20:25,220
yeah,
I think that just they're putting right.

3116
02:20:25,221 --> 02:20:27,020
Is that what they're doing?
It's a tough gig.

3117
02:20:27,440 --> 02:20:30,500
Tough gig right there,
but I'm not that good at golf.

3118
02:20:30,740 --> 02:20:32,320
I'm never played it.
Really?

3119
02:20:32,430 --> 02:20:33,070
Yeah.
Never.

3120
02:20:33,140 --> 02:20:35,500
Best part golf carts.
Yes.

3121
02:20:35,510 --> 02:20:38,270
That's really like my dad,
when he would go play golf,

3122
02:20:38,271 --> 02:20:40,340
I would always go with him as a kid 
because I was like,

3123
02:20:40,341 --> 02:20:41,540
yeah,
can I drive the golf cart?

3124
02:20:42,070 --> 02:20:44,250
And then when there's no water like 
waterhole,

3125
02:20:44,270 --> 02:20:49,270
then I would take his own ball finder 
and just swim with a little stick and 

3126
02:20:49,270 --> 02:20:49,270
try to get as many balls as I could.

3127
02:20:49,270 --> 02:20:52,160
I have a friend of mine who has a ranch 
in California and uh,

3128
02:20:52,190 --> 02:20:55,160
he has golf course and just drive golf 
carts around and when she lets us little

3129
02:20:55,161 --> 02:20:56,510
kids take the golf cart.
So.

3130
02:20:56,710 --> 02:20:58,190
And one of his daughters like 
[inaudible],

3131
02:20:58,191 --> 02:21:03,191
she was driving us around his fucking 
golf cart ranch where the town I live 

3132
02:21:03,191 --> 02:21:03,191
in.
You can have golf carts.

3133
02:21:03,191 --> 02:21:03,710
Really?
Yeah.

3134
02:21:03,940 --> 02:21:05,270
You must have lived in a little tiny 
place.

3135
02:21:05,271 --> 02:21:06,670
I do.
That's cool.

3136
02:21:06,710 --> 02:21:09,080
I grew up in this town called peach tree
city in Georgia.

3137
02:21:09,081 --> 02:21:14,081
It's south of Atlanta,
it's built on five golf courses and the 

3138
02:21:14,081 --> 02:21:17,141
idea was that you could get to any of 
these little miniature neighborhoods on 

3139
02:21:17,141 --> 02:21:20,771
a golf cart.
So there's a hundred miles a golf cart 

3140
02:21:20,771 --> 02:21:23,111
path there.
So if we're at my house and you want to 

3141
02:21:23,111 --> 02:21:23,111
go to dinner,
like we can just get on the golf cart,

3142
02:21:23,111 --> 02:21:24,720
it's a little bit like the movie the 
Truman show,

3143
02:21:24,721 --> 02:21:26,540
like he definitely feel like there's a 
bubble over it,

3144
02:21:26,541 --> 02:21:27,860
but it's also a golf cart.

3145
02:21:27,860 --> 02:21:30,140
So it's really fun.
That was kind of cool.

3146
02:21:30,320 --> 02:21:31,820
Huh?
And you can soup them up.

3147
02:21:31,970 --> 02:21:36,690
I built a golf cart on my new show,
but it's a 69 Subaru three 60 van,

3148
02:21:36,691 --> 02:21:39,500
a microcar.
And I built it on a golf cart chassis.

3149
02:21:39,900 --> 02:21:42,150
This just got 20 horsepower,
single cylinder engine.

3150
02:21:42,170 --> 02:21:46,070
The thing about golf golf courses is 
pesticides.

3151
02:21:46,220 --> 02:21:51,220
And uh,
I knew a dude who got bone cancer and a 

3152
02:21:51,220 --> 02:21:53,741
lot of people in his neighborhood got 
bone cancer because the water from the 

3153
02:21:53,741 --> 02:21:57,551
pesticides are in the wells and uh,
like a lot of people in his 

3154
02:21:57,591 --> 02:21:58,940
neighborhood.
All cancer.

3155
02:22:01,010 --> 02:22:06,010
Yeah.
Pesticides or there's just the term 

3156
02:22:06,010 --> 02:22:09,520
pesticide past like it's just poison.
Just call it what the fuck it is.

3157
02:22:10,131 --> 02:22:13,310
Why are you calling it pesticides?
You're poisoning bugs.

3158
02:22:13,311 --> 02:22:16,010
Bugs are tough,
mean roaches are going to be half to the

3159
02:22:16,011 --> 02:22:19,980
fucking nuclear bombs go off and you're 
killing them with some chemicals and you

3160
02:22:19,981 --> 02:22:22,730
leave that shit in the grass and it gets
through the ground,

3161
02:22:22,731 --> 02:22:27,731
seeps into the water and then people 
drink the water and they get sick as 

3162
02:22:27,731 --> 02:22:27,731
fuck.

3163
02:22:27,731 --> 02:22:28,290
Pesticides.
They're just.

3164
02:22:28,590 --> 02:22:33,590
That's a creepy thing.
That seems pretty obvious to us then 

3165
02:22:33,590 --> 02:22:33,590
that pretty God damn obvious and yet we 
just go.

3166
02:22:33,630 --> 02:22:36,360
But the people that live in the golf 
course or near the golf course,

3167
02:22:36,361 --> 02:22:41,361
they didn't even think about it.
They just let it seep into the well 

3168
02:22:41,361 --> 02:22:41,840
water because it looks real pretty.
Yeah.

3169
02:22:42,310 --> 02:22:45,930
The only way to keep it pretty.
You gotta keep killing bugs.

3170
02:22:46,080 --> 02:22:47,610
Keep slit after,
right?

3171
02:22:47,640 --> 02:22:48,620
It's key.
Policing them.

3172
02:22:48,630 --> 02:22:50,670
Spraying.
It's brutal.

3173
02:22:51,730 --> 02:22:54,720
Yeah.
I'm one of the pesticides.

3174
02:22:54,870 --> 02:22:56,940
I was,
I'm listening to his radio lab podcast.

3175
02:22:57,400 --> 02:22:59,370
I'm the way they,
um,

3176
02:22:59,610 --> 02:23:04,610
figured out how to use poison gas in the
concentration camps.

3177
02:23:05,610 --> 02:23:10,610
They used Zyklon B and zipline a was 
originally developed as a pesticide and 

3178
02:23:10,700 --> 02:23:13,360
so they,
they use this gas zipline,

3179
02:23:13,410 --> 02:23:17,450
a had a particular aroma to it to alert 
anyone that was near it or handling it.

3180
02:23:17,470 --> 02:23:19,020
It was very dangerous,
so the,

3181
02:23:19,021 --> 02:23:24,021
the Nazis re engineered Zyklon a and 
turn it into a Ziploc bag and took out 

3182
02:23:24,021 --> 02:23:28,341
the smell and you started using it as 
gas and the concentration camps designed

3183
02:23:29,010 --> 02:23:31,740
a by a Jew,
not only that,

3184
02:23:31,741 --> 02:23:36,741
a Jew who was one of the first guys to 
figure or the guy figured out how to 

3185
02:23:36,741 --> 02:23:38,200
pull the nitrogen out of the air like 
they,

3186
02:23:38,220 --> 02:23:43,220
like I'm a big majority of the particles
in the air apparently or nitrogen and 

3187
02:23:43,220 --> 02:23:45,920
nitrogen is very difficult to get w for 
fertilizer and stuff.

3188
02:23:46,230 --> 02:23:49,260
It's very difficult to acquire but 
necessary in order to grow plants.

3189
02:23:49,710 --> 02:23:54,710
And so this guy hopper Fritz hopper 
figured out how to pull it out of the 

3190
02:23:54,710 --> 02:23:57,210
air and uh,
use it for fertilizer.

3191
02:23:57,211 --> 02:23:59,910
And apparently that method that he 
developed in 19,

3192
02:23:59,911 --> 02:24:03,060
19 fucking [inaudible] or some shit like
that during World War One.

3193
02:24:03,300 --> 02:24:08,300
That method is still being used today.
And like half of the food that people 

3194
02:24:08,430 --> 02:24:12,810
eat in the world is fertilized from this
method.

3195
02:24:13,590 --> 02:24:18,590
Same Guy Develop Zyklon b or cycle on a.
At least I feel like if they ever need 

3196
02:24:18,590 --> 02:24:22,260
to go in front of Congress and talk 
about the legalization of marijuana,

3197
02:24:22,261 --> 02:24:27,261
I think we could take a video clip of 
that last 45 seconds of you telling me 

3198
02:24:27,261 --> 02:24:28,620
that story and then like people would be
like,

3199
02:24:28,621 --> 02:24:33,621
well,
he can remember all that and he smokes 

3200
02:24:33,621 --> 02:24:33,621
weed.
We should probably just let it go.

3201
02:24:33,621 --> 02:24:38,450
That's great.
That's the kind of podcasts that you 

3202
02:24:38,450 --> 02:24:38,450
relax and listen to.
Shit that I listen to.

3203
02:24:38,450 --> 02:24:39,040
Yeah.
Why love stuff.

3204
02:24:39,200 --> 02:24:40,380
Yeah.
That history.

3205
02:24:40,381 --> 02:24:41,790
Podcasts.
I love those.

3206
02:24:42,150 --> 02:24:45,480
I just thought I'd love.
I'm fascinating information.

3207
02:24:45,481 --> 02:24:46,980
I don't have any information that makes 
me go.

3208
02:24:47,040 --> 02:24:48,450
What the fuck,
right.

3209
02:24:48,451 --> 02:24:49,800
Anything like that.
You know,

3210
02:24:50,180 --> 02:24:52,050
pot does not fuck with your memory.

3211
02:24:52,050 --> 02:24:54,600
It fucks with your memory about shit you
were just talking about.

3212
02:24:54,720 --> 02:24:59,670
I don't mean that's what you just laid 
down was brilliant.

3213
02:25:00,480 --> 02:25:04,350
But what's interesting in the way that 
the guy also was one of the first people

3214
02:25:04,351 --> 02:25:07,650
that use gas and warfare and he uses 
like,

3215
02:25:07,710 --> 02:25:10,820
I think it was a chlorine gas.
He used it on the,

3216
02:25:10,821 --> 02:25:13,500
uh,
English and the Canadians,

3217
02:25:13,501 --> 02:25:16,170
I think it was English and the Canadians
that they used it on,

3218
02:25:16,380 --> 02:25:18,600
but he was being,
he was,

3219
02:25:19,230 --> 02:25:24,230
he,
they thought the United States was 

3220
02:25:24,230 --> 02:25:24,230
addressing him as a war criminal the 
same time they

3221
02:25:24,230 --> 02:25:27,120
were using his fertilization methods.
I Kid,

3222
02:25:27,940 --> 02:25:30,160
right?
Like he was a very,

3223
02:25:30,161 --> 02:25:32,740
very complex guy,
was a very complex guy.

3224
02:25:32,770 --> 02:25:34,540
Like he wasn't a good guy,
but he wasn't,

3225
02:25:34,541 --> 02:25:35,470
I mean,
he was like,

3226
02:25:35,710 --> 02:25:40,710
he was brilliant in a lot of ways.
The radiolab podcast when anyone's 

3227
02:25:40,710 --> 02:25:41,920
interested,
it's called the bad show.

3228
02:25:42,310 --> 02:25:44,130
And it is about,
um,

3229
02:25:44,350 --> 02:25:47,650
a lot of people that did a lot of really
awful things.

3230
02:25:47,950 --> 02:25:50,560
And it's,
he's just one of the many stories.

3231
02:25:51,100 --> 02:25:53,680
Um,
but I've been on this world war one kick

3232
02:25:53,710 --> 02:25:54,540
lately.
Sure.

3233
02:25:54,650 --> 02:25:59,650
Because of Dan Carlin.
He's got this podcast called hardcore 

3234
02:25:59,650 --> 02:26:02,761
history and um,
he has his whole world war one series 

3235
02:26:02,761 --> 02:26:03,970
that's going on right now.
And just put the final,

3236
02:26:03,971 --> 02:26:06,640
I think it's the final episode out.
It's fucking amazing.

3237
02:26:07,060 --> 02:26:11,530
It's just so crazy that world war one 
was just for me,

3238
02:26:11,780 --> 02:26:16,780
a war that I never really thought about 
and if really looked into it and I've 

3239
02:26:16,780 --> 02:26:18,220
just been really getting into it lately 
because of these podcasts.

3240
02:26:18,220 --> 02:26:19,420
But.
So yeah,

3241
02:26:19,940 --> 02:26:24,940
it doesn't really fuck with your memory.
I just meant that was what you lay down 

3242
02:26:24,940 --> 02:26:24,940
and uh,
the,

3243
02:26:24,940 --> 02:26:29,760
the um,
there's a lot of layers to them and I 

3244
02:26:30,281 --> 02:26:32,110
just thought that was,
I was just sitting here thinking,

3245
02:26:32,260 --> 02:26:37,260
that's really impressive.
Inhibited you asked me about something 

3246
02:26:37,260 --> 02:26:37,260
about 10 minutes ago,
but what the fuck we're talking,

3247
02:26:37,260 --> 02:26:41,600
but what was it?
Or just 10 seconds ago we were just 

3248
02:26:41,600 --> 02:26:41,600
talking about whatever,
whatever.

3249
02:26:41,600 --> 02:26:43,810
I got to turn into my dad and I just 
can't remember things.

3250
02:26:43,840 --> 02:26:44,520
Really.
Yeah.

3251
02:26:44,650 --> 02:26:46,030
My Dad will,
will,

3252
02:26:46,240 --> 02:26:47,740
like the,
my friend that's a pilot.

3253
02:26:47,741 --> 02:26:49,870
Martin,
my dad has met Martin.

3254
02:26:50,140 --> 02:26:53,410
I met because he's introducing himself 
each time is a new time,

3255
02:26:53,530 --> 02:26:56,010
30 times.
And I'm like that.

3256
02:26:56,050 --> 02:26:58,130
That's smart.
And it's nice to meet you.

3257
02:26:58,210 --> 02:27:00,010
Yeah.
The teacher right now,

3258
02:27:00,011 --> 02:27:02,050
he's a pilot.
He's always been a pilot.

3259
02:27:02,051 --> 02:27:04,270
If your dad ever meets Martin and says,
good to see you,

3260
02:27:04,600 --> 02:27:06,670
then I'll know my dad's an actor.

3261
02:27:06,850 --> 02:27:08,980
Yeah.
Need some fucking Alpha brain song.

3262
02:27:08,981 --> 02:27:13,981
I've got to get some of this stuff.
This is this cognitive enhancing 

3263
02:27:13,981 --> 02:27:14,290
supplements.
Really good for memory.

3264
02:27:14,380 --> 02:27:17,460
I was in double blind placebo testing.
I wasn't kidding when I said I really.

3265
02:27:17,600 --> 02:27:22,600
I really enjoyed like watching you on 
instagram and the stuff that you're 

3266
02:27:22,600 --> 02:27:22,870
into.
Like I dig because you don't.

3267
02:27:22,960 --> 02:27:27,960
You're very honest about who you are.
She don't like you don't split hairs 

3268
02:27:27,960 --> 02:27:27,960
about like,
yeah,

3269
02:27:27,960 --> 02:27:29,200
this stuff is cool.
I want to learn more about it.

3270
02:27:29,470 --> 02:27:34,470
And you'll ask people like you have 
genuine interest in feedback and stuff 

3271
02:27:34,470 --> 02:27:37,651
like that.
That's what I did because there's so 

3272
02:27:37,651 --> 02:27:37,651
many people that are like that.
They wouldn't want to say like,

3273
02:27:37,651 --> 02:27:42,331
I had a coca cola classic at lunch today
because someone's going to tell him 

3274
02:27:42,331 --> 02:27:42,331
there's corn syrup in there.
Right.

3275
02:27:42,331 --> 02:27:43,930
Where you live in that kind of like a 
weird thing,

3276
02:27:43,931 --> 02:27:44,170
but.

3277
02:27:44,230 --> 02:27:47,630
Well if you really feel that way,
I feel like you shouldn't have classic.

3278
02:27:47,760 --> 02:27:48,380
Right.
You know,

3279
02:27:48,430 --> 02:27:51,490
just do what you want to do and if you 
have,

3280
02:27:51,491 --> 02:27:54,490
if there's any repercussions,
this is probably something you shouldn't

3281
02:27:54,491 --> 02:27:56,500
have done in the first place and you 
should learn from them.

3282
02:27:56,860 --> 02:28:01,860
I think so many people go through life 
like trying to project something instead

3283
02:28:02,201 --> 02:28:07,201
of just being who they are and working 
on what the negative aspects of whoever 

3284
02:28:07,201 --> 02:28:09,340
they have designed themselves to be said
of working on that.

3285
02:28:09,341 --> 02:28:14,341
They just put up this fucking fake 
facade that's too labor intensive.

3286
02:28:14,910 --> 02:28:19,910
I have no desire to do that.
I don't pretend you're someone who 

3287
02:28:19,910 --> 02:28:21,160
you're not.
Seems to me like a Glock goddamn effort.

3288
02:28:21,180 --> 02:28:22,050
Lot of work.
And

3289
02:28:22,050 --> 02:28:24,890
for what would you get out of it?
Like look at Charlie Sheen.

3290
02:28:25,190 --> 02:28:26,600
Okay.
That guy's a junkie.

3291
02:28:26,660 --> 02:28:31,660
Okay.
He's a junkie and he loves horse and 

3292
02:28:31,660 --> 02:28:33,460
everybody knows it and they love them.
It's not like some fucking secret,

3293
02:28:33,710 --> 02:28:35,840
but it's because he's like,
hey,

3294
02:28:35,960 --> 02:28:38,450
I like to smoke rocks.
And uh,

3295
02:28:38,451 --> 02:28:42,920
I pay girls to suck my Dick Goodnight.
I love him.

3296
02:28:42,921 --> 02:28:44,760
He's so refreshing.
Sawdust.

3297
02:28:44,790 --> 02:28:49,790
Isn't that amazing that a guy can be on 
a a network fucking television show,

3298
02:28:50,270 --> 02:28:54,410
like a squeaky clean cbs show like two,
two and a half men,

3299
02:28:54,680 --> 02:28:59,680
and do these interviews about doing 
smoking rocks and paying girls to leave.

3300
02:29:00,231 --> 02:29:02,450
You don't pay them to have sex with you.
Pay Him to leave.

3301
02:29:02,780 --> 02:29:04,220
And everybody's like,
yes,

3302
02:29:04,400 --> 02:29:06,340
I love them.
Hashtag winning,

3303
02:29:06,400 --> 02:29:08,560
right?
Hashtag tiger blood sugar blood.

3304
02:29:08,870 --> 02:29:10,450
I saw that all over the,
the,

3305
02:29:10,451 --> 02:29:12,770
the,
the Internet when that all went down.

3306
02:29:13,120 --> 02:29:14,000
Any,
you know,

3307
02:29:14,001 --> 02:29:17,960
look did the reality of who he was.
He was not pretty.

3308
02:29:18,190 --> 02:29:20,150
I mean it looks like he's a hundred 
years old.

3309
02:29:20,360 --> 02:29:24,140
His fucking face has fallen off.
He looks really bad.

3310
02:29:24,290 --> 02:29:25,160
Like there's,
there's some,

3311
02:29:25,310 --> 02:29:30,310
some of the videos that he did like 
right after he got kicked off that show 

3312
02:29:30,310 --> 02:29:33,790
and he did like these weird podcast 
style videos where he's like staring 

3313
02:29:33,790 --> 02:29:33,790
into the camera and the people behind 
him,

3314
02:29:34,040 --> 02:29:36,680
he looks like he's just sweaty death.
Right.

3315
02:29:36,710 --> 02:29:39,650
You know,
it was fucking mine.

3316
02:29:40,190 --> 02:29:45,190
Still.
People love the fact that he was being 

3317
02:29:45,190 --> 02:29:47,540
who he really is.
I think so much of what you see,

3318
02:29:47,541 --> 02:29:52,541
like when you see Tom Cruise jumping on 
oprah winfrey's couch saying how much 

3319
02:29:52,541 --> 02:29:52,760
she's in love.
I'm in love,

3320
02:29:52,761 --> 02:29:57,761
I'm in love,
I'm in love and all the women in the 

3321
02:29:57,761 --> 02:29:59,000
audience and everybody else

3322
02:29:59,120 --> 02:30:01,300
like bullshitting me,
you're bullshitting me,

3323
02:30:01,301 --> 02:30:03,580
but I'm used to being bullshitted so I 
just deal with it.

3324
02:30:03,581 --> 02:30:04,670
Right?
Like the bachelor,

3325
02:30:04,671 --> 02:30:06,520
you're peeing on my back and telling me 
it's raining.

3326
02:30:06,521 --> 02:30:07,780
Tom Cruise.
I'm used to it.

3327
02:30:07,781 --> 02:30:12,781
Now I'm going to put up with it,
but only because top gun was a great 

3328
02:30:12,781 --> 02:30:12,781
movie.
Exactly like we're shocked at.

3329
02:30:12,781 --> 02:30:15,880
That girl fucked a bunch of handsome 
guys that she got drunk with.

3330
02:30:16,450 --> 02:30:18,190
Whoever.
That girl is good for you,

3331
02:30:18,191 --> 02:30:20,680
young lady.
I hope you got your rocks off.

3332
02:30:21,190 --> 02:30:26,190
I hope you sucked.
A lot of delicious dicks and how gail 

3333
02:30:26,190 --> 02:30:26,530
time like flinstone style

3334
02:30:28,030 --> 02:30:29,390
flinstone style.

3335
02:30:32,960 --> 02:30:35,060
Just different world back then you could
say again,

3336
02:30:35,061 --> 02:30:36,590
it had nothing to do.
It's totally different.

3337
02:30:36,600 --> 02:30:41,600
Now.
The thing that I'm still puzzled by 

3338
02:30:41,600 --> 02:30:43,811
right now is that I got.
I put up a picture on instagram about 

3339
02:30:43,811 --> 02:30:47,680
like a picture with some friends or 
whatever and the amount of people that 

3340
02:30:47,680 --> 02:30:49,930
will go out of their way to say nasty 
stuff to strangers.

3341
02:30:50,110 --> 02:30:52,220
Yeah.
I'll put a picture up of of friends that

3342
02:30:52,221 --> 02:30:57,221
I'm hanging with and someone will go 
after someone in the picture and I'm 

3343
02:30:57,221 --> 02:30:57,221
like,
[inaudible],

3344
02:30:57,221 --> 02:30:59,600
how much is your life suck that you need
to go attack a stranger?

3345
02:31:00,590 --> 02:31:03,170
Virtually.
It's just not.

3346
02:31:03,740 --> 02:31:06,250
It seems to me the internet,
once they.

3347
02:31:06,280 --> 02:31:11,280
They fall into several categories,
but the most egregious or youtube and 

3348
02:31:11,280 --> 02:31:12,250
instagram.
Yeah,

3349
02:31:12,290 --> 02:31:14,060
like twitter.
At least.

3350
02:31:14,061 --> 02:31:19,061
My twitter feed is surprisingly polite 
and nice and genuine and kind friendly 

3351
02:31:19,850 --> 02:31:20,250
it.

3352
02:31:20,280 --> 02:31:25,280
I mean people was talking about the 
negative people that deal with the 

3353
02:31:25,280 --> 02:31:25,280
Internet.
I deal with Nice people.

3354
02:31:25,280 --> 02:31:27,210
99.9%
of the time.

3355
02:31:27,211 --> 02:31:32,211
It's almost all nice people.
Occasionally a Twat will sneak through 

3356
02:31:32,211 --> 02:31:35,050
the to the net and find their way into 
my twitter feed,

3357
02:31:35,051 --> 02:31:36,830
but then you just block them and then 
you're done with it.

3358
02:31:36,831 --> 02:31:38,220
Yeah,
but instagram,

3359
02:31:38,340 --> 02:31:41,820
good luck trying to block those fucking 
monsters and they all have.

3360
02:31:41,850 --> 02:31:44,670
If you go to their accounts,
they're all locked right there.

3361
02:31:44,671 --> 02:31:46,290
Like I feel like if you're going to be 
critical,

3362
02:31:46,330 --> 02:31:50,520
my pictures let me be critical of years.
There's a couple of times I always think

3363
02:31:50,880 --> 02:31:55,880
because for me it's not that different 
from like being in middle school and 

3364
02:31:55,880 --> 02:31:57,120
people like this cannot go shockey.
I was a little weird middle school too,

3365
02:31:57,121 --> 02:32:00,360
like that not much has changed.
The world was in middle school as well.

3366
02:32:00,430 --> 02:32:05,430
It's just more accepting of us.
I come from the exact same person but 

3367
02:32:05,430 --> 02:32:05,880
good for you.
It's like lunch room bullying,

3368
02:32:06,360 --> 02:32:11,360
but on this virtual level,
so I guess what I would stand up for 

3369
02:32:11,360 --> 02:32:12,990
myself then so sometimes I watch people 
and I don't get a lot anymore,

3370
02:32:12,991 --> 02:32:17,991
but like when when they said I was on 
top gear or when I started being on tv 

3371
02:32:17,991 --> 02:32:20,360
for Nascar than you would see those 
people come out of the woodwork and even

3372
02:32:20,370 --> 02:32:25,370
still like I did these funny videos for 
Nascar on NBC with like Danica Patrick 

3373
02:32:25,370 --> 02:32:29,830
and Kevin Hart,
all these people and someone will be 

3374
02:32:29,830 --> 02:32:29,830
like,
you suck,

3375
02:32:29,830 --> 02:32:29,830
you're fat,
you're stupid.

3376
02:32:29,830 --> 02:32:30,440
And that's fine.
I'm not.

3377
02:32:30,960 --> 02:32:32,670
I don't mind,
but I will.

3378
02:32:32,790 --> 02:32:37,790
I would say 95% of the time I at least 
like to know if it's something funny 

3379
02:32:37,861 --> 02:32:41,430
then I'll laugh and just move on.
But if it's something to where like they

3380
02:32:41,550 --> 02:32:43,380
they really want to go after you a lot,
I'll be like,

3381
02:32:43,381 --> 02:32:48,381
okay,
let me just at least look at your 

3382
02:32:48,381 --> 02:32:48,381
profile and if I can tell they don't 
know any better,

3383
02:32:48,381 --> 02:32:48,381
you just block them.

3384
02:32:48,381 --> 02:32:50,190
Unum wrong.
But if I feel like they know better,

3385
02:32:50,430 --> 02:32:55,430
every once in awhile I'll just lean back
a tiny bit and this guy one day when 

3386
02:32:55,430 --> 02:32:59,271
after me about something stupid and he 
told me how stupid I was and fat and 

3387
02:32:59,271 --> 02:33:00,360
ugly and I shouldn't have a job in 
whatever.

3388
02:33:00,660 --> 02:33:05,660
I looked at his picture,
his profile on twitter and it was a 

3389
02:33:05,660 --> 02:33:07,050
picture with him and his daughter like 
going canoeing and so all I said was,

3390
02:33:07,051 --> 02:33:09,480
hey man,
I hope no one ever says to your daughter

3391
02:33:09,780 --> 02:33:14,780
at school what you just said to me 
because I know that'll feel bad for you 

3392
02:33:14,780 --> 02:33:15,130
to hear that.
And He,

3393
02:33:15,140 --> 02:33:16,920
you would've thought I cussed his 
mother.

3394
02:33:16,921 --> 02:33:21,921
He came after me so hardcore at that.
How dare you look at my picture and how 

3395
02:33:21,921 --> 02:33:26,250
dare you try to dare you make me public 
is public.

3396
02:33:26,251 --> 02:33:27,030
We're all public.

3397
02:33:27,450 --> 02:33:29,340
If you're on the Internet,
you fuck your public.

3398
02:33:30,060 --> 02:33:32,610
Like I wasn't being mean.
I'm just being honest.

3399
02:33:32,611 --> 02:33:32,970
Like,
hey,

3400
02:33:32,971 --> 02:33:34,500
how about golden rule?
This sucker,

3401
02:33:34,501 --> 02:33:38,190
like don't say mean stuff to people.
If you don't want them to say it back to

3402
02:33:38,191 --> 02:33:43,191
you.
Like fascinated people have said mean 

3403
02:33:43,191 --> 02:33:43,191
shit to me and I retweet them.
That's it.

3404
02:33:43,191 --> 02:33:46,230
Just retained them and like you pick 
your friends.

3405
02:33:46,231 --> 02:33:46,590
I mean,
no,

3406
02:33:46,591 --> 02:33:46,870
no,
no,

3407
02:33:46,871 --> 02:33:47,130
no,
no,

3408
02:33:47,131 --> 02:33:52,131
no.
All I did was retweet what you put out 

3409
02:33:52,131 --> 02:33:55,440
there.
This is you and I let everyone know this

3410
02:33:55,441 --> 02:33:56,680
is you.
This is you.

3411
02:33:56,880 --> 02:33:58,230
This is shared,
you know,

3412
02:33:58,440 --> 02:34:01,140
shared.
You know that's not being a bully.

3413
02:34:01,141 --> 02:34:02,530
Do I have a bigger platform?
You?

3414
02:34:02,550 --> 02:34:03,630
Of course I do.
Fuck face.

3415
02:34:03,631 --> 02:34:05,580
That's how you know who I am.
I don't know who you are.

3416
02:34:05,910 --> 02:34:07,640
That's simple logic.
It's like,

3417
02:34:07,790 --> 02:34:12,790
don't stick your hand the cage if you 
don't want to get bit because that's 

3418
02:34:12,790 --> 02:34:15,711
what's going to happen.
I'm going to retweet you and then 

3419
02:34:15,711 --> 02:34:17,991
everyone is going to all these other 
people that are bored looking for some 

3420
02:34:17,991 --> 02:34:18,190
asshole to shit

3421
02:34:18,190 --> 02:34:18,670
on.
Right?

3422
02:34:18,720 --> 02:34:20,860
They get home at Tartar taking shit from
their boss.

3423
02:34:20,861 --> 02:34:25,861
Their fucking wife is an asshole.
They're kids suck and they're happy to 

3424
02:34:25,861 --> 02:34:28,240
climb up your ass and plant bombs.
They're happy.

3425
02:34:28,420 --> 02:34:30,430
I'll give you an earful.
Exactly,

3426
02:34:30,640 --> 02:34:35,640
but I think it's because of the same 
reasons why people were bullying people 

3427
02:34:35,640 --> 02:34:38,740
in middle school where you don't see 
nearly as much when you become an adult.

3428
02:34:39,110 --> 02:34:41,070
I think it's because it's a new thing,
Sharon.

3429
02:34:41,080 --> 02:34:45,640
I think that the cyber communication is.
It's untested.

3430
02:34:45,820 --> 02:34:48,460
We have to figure it out.
We don't know what the fuck we're doing.

3431
02:34:48,700 --> 02:34:51,250
All the normal shit involved in 
communication,

3432
02:34:51,251 --> 02:34:55,150
like social cues and knowing first of 
all,

3433
02:34:55,450 --> 02:34:59,320
someone accepting you as a person who 
want to have a conversation with.

3434
02:34:59,321 --> 02:35:04,321
There's a lot of these people that 
you're communicating with online that 

3435
02:35:04,321 --> 02:35:05,950
you would never accept as communication 
partners in real life.

3436
02:35:05,990 --> 02:35:07,300
Right?
You would meet them.

3437
02:35:07,301 --> 02:35:12,301
They'd be gross.
He'd be like Mike a dick and he just 

3438
02:35:12,301 --> 02:35:14,750
like stopped talking to him.
He right or stop visiting his place of 

3439
02:35:14,750 --> 02:35:18,001
business or or whatever,
but because they can just get to you 

3440
02:35:18,001 --> 02:35:19,540
without any,
you don't have to accept them.

3441
02:35:19,541 --> 02:35:23,140
You don't have to choose them to pick 
you because you pick your friends.

3442
02:35:23,141 --> 02:35:26,380
If you're a wise person and you'll have 
a better life if you do that.

3443
02:35:26,680 --> 02:35:29,410
If you don't pick your friends,
you just let let anybody in your life.

3444
02:35:29,500 --> 02:35:34,500
You develop a series of fucking 
incurable disasters over and over and 

3445
02:35:34,500 --> 02:35:36,940
over again that you never really recover
from and you live your life based on the

3446
02:35:36,941 --> 02:35:41,941
momentum of a bunch of assholes who 
aren't thinking straight then that's a 

3447
02:35:41,941 --> 02:35:42,850
lot of people.
I have friends like that,

3448
02:35:42,880 --> 02:35:47,880
but live their life like that.
It's just one disaster after another 

3449
02:35:47,880 --> 02:35:51,430
fucking disaster and if you get caught 
up in the hurricane that is their life,

3450
02:35:51,431 --> 02:35:53,020
they'll drag you into the cyclone.

3451
02:35:53,020 --> 02:35:57,100
You'll get fucking tossed out into the 
ocean somewhere or you.

3452
02:35:57,120 --> 02:35:59,350
You choose.
But in the online world,

3453
02:35:59,351 --> 02:36:04,351
you don't get to choose.
So if you're out there and what they're 

3454
02:36:04,351 --> 02:36:07,231
doing by blocking you,
they think my wildest get him and he 

3455
02:36:07,231 --> 02:36:10,531
can't even me back and so they put their
little fucking locked profile on 

3456
02:36:11,741 --> 02:36:14,470
instagram and it's just guaranteed 
they're a coward.

3457
02:36:14,471 --> 02:36:17,020
Like anybody who has a locked profile to
talk shit.

3458
02:36:17,460 --> 02:36:19,240
I don't.
I just block them immediately.

3459
02:36:19,390 --> 02:36:23,170
I don't even think twice.
I don't speak to them if they think like

3460
02:36:23,171 --> 02:36:26,540
they like there's a rider in Nascar,
the blocked me and I was laughing,

3461
02:36:26,550 --> 02:36:27,710
right?
Yeah.

3462
02:36:27,790 --> 02:36:28,720
And,
and it,

3463
02:36:28,960 --> 02:36:32,020
it was just one of those things where 
for some reason this guy decided the day

3464
02:36:32,021 --> 02:36:33,040
I showed up,
he hated me,

3465
02:36:33,340 --> 02:36:38,340
but I laughed because I thought that 
means you thought I wanted to know what 

3466
02:36:38,340 --> 02:36:42,421
you thought,
but I never wanted to know what you 

3467
02:36:42,421 --> 02:36:42,460
thought because I didn't care then and I
didn't care now.

3468
02:36:42,460 --> 02:36:43,960
But the fact that he went to that 
effort,

3469
02:36:44,350 --> 02:36:49,350
it made me giggle.
Like same thing with if some stranger 

3470
02:36:49,350 --> 02:36:49,930
says you're stupid and then blocked me,
I'm so sorry.

3471
02:36:50,440 --> 02:36:55,440
You must have thought I was going to 
want to learn more about you after you 

3472
02:36:55,440 --> 02:36:59,041
insulted me.
What provider could seriously get to 

3473
02:36:59,041 --> 02:37:00,850
know you and not take care of Greg Carr?
That's choosing to me.

3474
02:37:01,510 --> 02:37:03,230
They're very friendly guy.
Like why?

3475
02:37:03,240 --> 02:37:05,770
Why did he decide that you're a dick?
Great question.

3476
02:37:05,860 --> 02:37:07,360
What was his criticism?
What he say?

3477
02:37:07,361 --> 02:37:08,200
What's his name,
by the way?

3478
02:37:08,270 --> 02:37:10,220
No,
please find out.

3479
02:37:10,270 --> 02:37:14,020
There's this one guy,
this one guy who was a nascar rider.

3480
02:37:15,200 --> 02:37:16,880
Too many of the other way.
There's a bunch.

3481
02:37:16,881 --> 02:37:17,810
There's a bunch.
It's a.

3482
02:37:17,811 --> 02:37:18,970
It is a great guy.
Honestly.

3483
02:37:18,971 --> 02:37:19,470
It's great,
right?

3484
02:37:19,480 --> 02:37:20,930
With crayons,
Napkins?

3485
02:37:21,040 --> 02:37:22,310
Not Anymore.
They.

3486
02:37:22,311 --> 02:37:24,440
I think most of them have a brother 
typewriter.

3487
02:37:24,710 --> 02:37:26,180
I think his brother is that right?

3488
02:37:26,630 --> 02:37:31,280
This one dude would go on like serious 
and say terrible things about me.

3489
02:37:31,281 --> 02:37:33,830
How much he disliked me,
but then it was really nice to me at the

3490
02:37:33,831 --> 02:37:36,710
track and he did a bunch of shows.
Big Boy,

3491
02:37:36,711 --> 02:37:38,270
and I'll say this.
My boy,

3492
02:37:38,271 --> 02:37:42,170
like a fat guy was sloppy.
He was big size load.

3493
02:37:42,740 --> 02:37:44,860
Every motherfucker he's gone,
he's dead.

3494
02:37:45,440 --> 02:37:47,570
He died of a heart attack.
It's poor fat.

3495
02:37:47,640 --> 02:37:52,640
Had a.
He had a windbreaker that he would take 

3496
02:37:52,640 --> 02:37:52,640
when he went to eat chili dogs.
Whoa.

3497
02:37:52,640 --> 02:37:53,660
And that was kind of when I found that 
out.

3498
02:37:53,661 --> 02:37:54,800
So when I worked with is like,
you know,

3499
02:37:54,801 --> 02:37:56,870
he puts on like a tarp,
the chili dogs.

3500
02:37:56,880 --> 02:37:57,770
I was like,
I can't,

3501
02:37:58,280 --> 02:38:03,280
I got to leave.
This guy knows his stuff is a lot worse 

3502
02:38:03,280 --> 02:38:04,370
than anything I got going on in my life.
If you need a tarp for Chile though,

3503
02:38:04,371 --> 02:38:07,700
either he really loves clothes or knows 
he's a slob.

3504
02:38:07,700 --> 02:38:09,310
And just gave in,
I think it was the second,

3505
02:38:10,140 --> 02:38:15,140
it was a lot of self loathing is 
involved in people being mean to people 

3506
02:38:15,140 --> 02:38:17,270
because they want you to feel the way 
they feel a little bit.

3507
02:38:17,630 --> 02:38:18,830
You know,
they want to reach out.

3508
02:38:19,130 --> 02:38:22,730
Like I've had communication with people 
online like really mean to people.

3509
02:38:22,731 --> 02:38:27,731
And then you go and look at their 
twitter feed and like you'll find some 

3510
02:38:27,731 --> 02:38:29,620
like suicidal shit in there.
You'll find you some miserable.

3511
02:38:29,690 --> 02:38:31,190
Yeah,
there's a lot of that.

3512
02:38:31,191 --> 02:38:32,780
There's a lot of people out there that 
are hurting.

3513
02:38:32,781 --> 02:38:37,781
I think the model of life that the 
majority of people are living in civil 

3514
02:38:38,301 --> 02:38:42,200
as well as in civilization.
The civil civilized world,

3515
02:38:42,201 --> 02:38:47,201
when you're involving offices and jobs 
that you don't really want and places 

3516
02:38:47,201 --> 02:38:51,371
that you don't really want to go to,
but you have to like what you're doing 

3517
02:38:51,371 --> 02:38:51,371
for a living.

3518
02:38:51,371 --> 02:38:55,240
You enjoy your.
Obviously you have a real passion for 

3519
02:38:55,240 --> 02:38:56,300
cars and totally great time.
That's the ideal life for everybody.

3520
02:38:56,370 --> 02:39:01,370
That's what everybody really wants,
but there's not a lot of people get to 

3521
02:39:01,370 --> 02:39:01,370
be you.
Sure.

3522
02:39:01,370 --> 02:39:04,160
Small amount of people that get to be 
you just it's.

3523
02:39:04,170 --> 02:39:05,440
It's like a.
not even a one.

3524
02:39:05,590 --> 02:39:10,590
You know?
People talk about the one percenters 

3525
02:39:10,590 --> 02:39:10,590
isn't even the 1% that are doing what 
they want to do.

3526
02:39:10,590 --> 02:39:14,291
Do you think Donald Trump is doing,
he wants to do that for fucking goofy 

3527
02:39:14,291 --> 02:39:14,291
Prek wants to be president.
He wants to.

3528
02:39:14,291 --> 02:39:19,090
He wants to be loved.
He was paying people to cheer at his 

3529
02:39:19,090 --> 02:39:20,240
presidential announcement.
He's just an ego.

3530
02:39:20,241 --> 02:39:22,990
He's just a big ego.
You know that's not.

3531
02:39:23,180 --> 02:39:28,180
He just got on that path and that's the 
path that he's using to try to validate 

3532
02:39:28,180 --> 02:39:33,041
himself,
but if you are not living a life that 

3533
02:39:33,041 --> 02:39:37,121
you enjoy,
you're going to have this fucking 

3534
02:39:37,121 --> 02:39:39,560
feeling all the time of God dammit,
like,

3535
02:39:39,561 --> 02:39:41,660
why can't I be on top gear?

3536
02:39:41,660 --> 02:39:46,660
Or why can't I do this?
Or why can't I be the fucking UFC 

3537
02:39:46,660 --> 02:39:47,840
commentator?
Or why can't I be the president?

3538
02:39:47,841 --> 02:39:51,270
Or why can't I do this and what about?
And that's,

3539
02:39:51,690 --> 02:39:53,120
that's a lot of people,
man,

3540
02:39:53,121 --> 02:39:58,121
it's all day is fuck,
this guy is fucking core vet and fuck 

3541
02:39:58,121 --> 02:40:01,931
that guy in his Ferrari and fuck this 
guy in his big house and fuck him and 

3542
02:40:01,931 --> 02:40:04,730
his hot wife and fucking with his 
fucking kids that don't suck.

3543
02:40:05,950 --> 02:40:08,360
No,
it's true.

3544
02:40:08,720 --> 02:40:13,720
It's hard and most of us,
we're the victims of Shitty childhoods 

3545
02:40:13,720 --> 02:40:17,711
and people who had kids that didn't know
what the fuck they were doing and they 

3546
02:40:17,711 --> 02:40:17,711
pray.
It's like,

3547
02:40:17,711 --> 02:40:19,440
it's like imagine getting programmed.
Imagine if you had a program,

3548
02:40:19,500 --> 02:40:21,030
a computer program,
right?

3549
02:40:21,031 --> 02:40:26,031
And your computer was programmed by 
someone like me who doesn't know Jack 

3550
02:40:26,031 --> 02:40:30,230
Shit about computers.
I know how to type my name in the 

3551
02:40:30,230 --> 02:40:30,230
fucking,
you know,

3552
02:40:30,230 --> 02:40:33,700
my password and how to get my gmail,
but I don't know what's going on 

3553
02:40:33,700 --> 02:40:33,880
underneath the surface as well.

3554
02:40:34,020 --> 02:40:35,910
I don't know.
So I'm an idiot.

3555
02:40:36,080 --> 02:40:37,920
You know,
if I had to program my own computer,

3556
02:40:37,921 --> 02:40:40,320
it'd be a disaster.
It would be crashing every five.

3557
02:40:40,530 --> 02:40:45,530
That's a human being.
It's essentially like a gigantic 

3558
02:40:45,530 --> 02:40:46,560
biological computer.
What's your most complex?

3559
02:40:46,561 --> 02:40:51,561
When we know and they're being 
engineered and program by morons,

3560
02:40:52,020 --> 02:40:57,020
millions and millions of morons.
They're raising kids and fucking them up

3561
02:40:57,630 --> 02:41:02,630
and then it's our job as the kids who 
got fucked up to sort of decipher what 

3562
02:41:02,630 --> 02:41:07,101
the fuck are parents did wrong to us are
and try to make it through life with as 

3563
02:41:07,101 --> 02:41:11,121
much happiness as we possibly can to our
heart stops beating and that's a complex

3564
02:41:11,341 --> 02:41:14,580
puzzle and everybody makes it through 
and figures that fucking thing out.

3565
02:41:14,640 --> 02:41:19,640
That's it.
Those are the people on instagram with 

3566
02:41:19,640 --> 02:41:21,501
locked accounts and those are the people
that eat chili dogs with wind breakers 

3567
02:41:21,501 --> 02:41:25,881
on and smile to your face and Shit on 
you and your fucking computer or on 

3568
02:41:26,220 --> 02:41:28,500
Sirius satellite radio or whatever they 
do.

3569
02:41:28,501 --> 02:41:29,460
It's just,
it's hard.

3570
02:41:29,461 --> 02:41:30,600
It's hard to be nice,
man.

3571
02:41:30,660 --> 02:41:35,660
It's hard.
It's hard to let yourself forget about 

3572
02:41:35,660 --> 02:41:37,731
liking other people,
especially liking other people that are 

3573
02:41:37,731 --> 02:41:37,731
successful.
Host in top gear.

3574
02:41:37,731 --> 02:41:40,830
That handsome tanner foust and that 
beautiful Adam Ferrara.

3575
02:41:40,950 --> 02:41:43,920
I mean,
I will say this.

3576
02:41:43,921 --> 02:41:45,390
I think you know,
like if,

3577
02:41:46,170 --> 02:41:48,030
if,
if your life sucks,

3578
02:41:48,090 --> 02:41:50,050
if it's now or you want,
you know,

3579
02:41:50,051 --> 02:41:51,180
you,
we've all been there,

3580
02:41:51,181 --> 02:41:54,340
but like I think a lot of people forget 
sometimes that you can change that.

3581
02:41:54,341 --> 02:41:59,341
Like we,
the reality that we're flying through 

3582
02:41:59,341 --> 02:41:59,550
this gigantic marble in space.
It will kind of blow your mind,

3583
02:41:59,850 --> 02:42:03,240
but the fact that you can wake up every 
day and do what you want to do or not do

3584
02:42:03,241 --> 02:42:05,310
what you want to do,
like that's pretty awesome.

3585
02:42:05,400 --> 02:42:07,710
Like I these things,
the fact that we're sitting here,

3586
02:42:07,711 --> 02:42:10,110
this didn't happen by accident.
You know,

3587
02:42:10,111 --> 02:42:14,010
and I think sometimes people forget that
like if there's something out there that

3588
02:42:14,011 --> 02:42:19,011
you want,
you're going to have to physically do 

3589
02:42:19,011 --> 02:42:19,011
something about it,
you know,

3590
02:42:19,011 --> 02:42:19,760
and that's the one thing that when 
people come after me that I,

3591
02:42:19,790 --> 02:42:21,810
I,
I love having fun.

3592
02:42:21,810 --> 02:42:26,810
Like I want to make people's day better.
That for me it was like I was either 

3593
02:42:26,810 --> 02:42:28,380
going to try to go back to school and be
some sort of teacher,

3594
02:42:28,710 --> 02:42:33,710
like a high school counselor because 
columbine and stuff like that breaks my 

3595
02:42:33,710 --> 02:42:34,550
heart like I can't believe that 
happened.

3596
02:42:34,580 --> 02:42:39,580
And it's because those kids didn't have 
the parents that I did when they got 

3597
02:42:39,580 --> 02:42:40,710
made fun of the parents weren't there to
say,

3598
02:42:40,770 --> 02:42:42,780
you're fine.
There's nothing wrong with you.

3599
02:42:42,781 --> 02:42:47,781
There's something wrong with those 
people that they don't have enough 

3600
02:42:47,781 --> 02:42:51,021
confidence in who they are,
that they're going to take it out on 

3601
02:42:51,021 --> 02:42:51,021
everybody else.
And so I thought,

3602
02:42:51,021 --> 02:42:52,340
well,
I'm either going to do that or I'm going

3603
02:42:52,341 --> 02:42:55,050
to try and get on TV and make as many 
people smile as I can,

3604
02:42:55,410 --> 02:42:57,630
but it's because I wanted to do 
something about it like that.

3605
02:42:57,930 --> 02:43:02,930
I just sometimes it breaks my heart that
there are people that aren't willing to 

3606
02:43:02,930 --> 02:43:03,690
push and say I want something better.

3607
02:43:03,920 --> 02:43:08,920
I think a lot of people feel trapped in 
their existence because they sort of 

3608
02:43:08,920 --> 02:43:13,300
live their life on momentum and they got
kind of stuck in this trap.

3609
02:43:13,330 --> 02:43:18,330
They're in high school and then they go 
to college and they get student loans 

3610
02:43:18,330 --> 02:43:18,780
and they somehow get out and they don't 
have a job.

3611
02:43:18,810 --> 02:43:23,810
They're trying to find a job and then 
they take whatever job they can get and 

3612
02:43:23,810 --> 02:43:26,881
they still have debt and then they have 
a family and then they have mouths to 

3613
02:43:26,881 --> 02:43:30,031
feed and they feel fucking trapped and 
was super frustrated so they see a guy 

3614
02:43:30,031 --> 02:43:33,781
like you who's putting a 900 horsepower 
engine Osi on and running around like a 

3615
02:43:33,781 --> 02:43:38,071
fucking crazy person on television and 
they get mad because you look at your 

3616
02:43:38,071 --> 02:43:38,260
sweet guy,
have a big smile on your face.

3617
02:43:38,261 --> 02:43:39,490
You look like you're having a great 
time.

3618
02:43:39,790 --> 02:43:41,890
And for people who are not having a good
time,

3619
02:43:41,891 --> 02:43:46,060
one of the most punishing things is 
watching someone live their life better.

3620
02:43:46,360 --> 02:43:48,730
It's like,
like we were talking about drifting,

3621
02:43:49,030 --> 02:43:52,150
like how good tanner is a driving a 
fucking car when he drifts.

3622
02:43:52,151 --> 02:43:53,200
He's like,
he's an artist,

3623
02:43:53,201 --> 02:43:58,201
right?
It's like he's moving like a ballet 

3624
02:43:58,201 --> 02:43:58,201
dancer total if you,
if I was drifting.

3625
02:43:58,201 --> 02:44:00,250
I'm sure I do it way.
I don't even know how to drift.

3626
02:44:00,251 --> 02:44:00,700
Okay.
Let's,

3627
02:44:00,701 --> 02:44:03,670
let's pretend I did.
I took some drifting lessons today.

3628
02:44:03,730 --> 02:44:04,930
Sure.
I know how to drive,

3629
02:44:04,931 --> 02:44:07,420
but I guarantee uh,
I've looked like a clunk.

3630
02:44:07,450 --> 02:44:09,850
Clunky fuck fuckhead in comparison to 
him.

3631
02:44:09,900 --> 02:44:14,620
I'm not doing as good a job and the 
drifting or driving or doing anything or

3632
02:44:14,890 --> 02:44:17,920
bowling or fucking playing darts.
It's like life.

3633
02:44:18,090 --> 02:44:19,870
So he's going to be people that are 
better at it than you.

3634
02:44:20,200 --> 02:44:22,330
Okay.
And you could either learn what are they

3635
02:44:22,331 --> 02:44:26,410
doing differently and try to apply that 
to your own life or you can just shit on

3636
02:44:26,411 --> 02:44:26,560
them.

3637
02:44:27,870 --> 02:44:29,800
No,
you easier to shit.

3638
02:44:29,801 --> 02:44:31,660
It's a lot easier to.
Shouldn't have tried to learn.

3639
02:44:31,661 --> 02:44:34,390
So it's a lot easier to shit on them.
And sometimes you shitting on people and

3640
02:44:34,391 --> 02:44:35,680
you're correct.
You know,

3641
02:44:35,681 --> 02:44:37,390
sometimes you shitting on people and you
know,

3642
02:44:37,391 --> 02:44:42,391
you,
you realize you are watching some 

3643
02:44:42,391 --> 02:44:44,610
bloated ego or some ridiculous version 
of a pop singer that record companies 

3644
02:44:46,391 --> 02:44:48,840
are trying to stuff down your face and 
you know it's Horseshit,

3645
02:44:48,890 --> 02:44:51,160
right?
You're correct.

3646
02:44:51,161 --> 02:44:52,550
And comparing them to,
you know,

3647
02:44:52,551 --> 02:44:53,620
whatever,
fill in the blank,

3648
02:44:53,621 --> 02:44:57,160
Lou Reed or Mick Jagger or whatever the 
fuck it is that you really appreciate.

3649
02:44:57,190 --> 02:45:01,420
You're correct,
but a lot of times it's just pitching.

3650
02:45:02,040 --> 02:45:05,530
A lot of times you're just trying to 
figure out why you're not happy.

3651
02:45:05,780 --> 02:45:10,780
You know,
you're seeing someone on television or 

3652
02:45:10,780 --> 02:45:10,800
in movies or just on the cover of a 
magazine and you're,

3653
02:45:10,870 --> 02:45:14,440
you're angry because it's not you 
because for whatever reason,

3654
02:45:14,441 --> 02:45:19,441
you got down a bad path and you got 
stuck in this fucking shitty existence 

3655
02:45:19,871 --> 02:45:22,960
that seems to have no exit door.
You don't know what to do.

3656
02:45:23,320 --> 02:45:28,000
So you lock up that instagram account.
You Start Shit graphing on strangers.

3657
02:45:30,990 --> 02:45:35,990
Fucking Shitty fucking dad.
Just farting in your fucking office 

3658
02:45:37,331 --> 02:45:42,331
chair and sniffing your own farts and 
keeping typing and horrible people out 

3659
02:45:42,331 --> 02:45:47,191
there.
I don't mean to make you think that I 

3660
02:45:47,191 --> 02:45:47,380
have a ton of those.
They're just have them look.

3661
02:45:47,381 --> 02:45:49,770
The better you do,
the more you're going to have snow.

3662
02:45:49,780 --> 02:45:52,780
There's no getting around it,
but I think it's a temporary stop.

3663
02:45:53,350 --> 02:45:58,350
I really do.
I think we're about maybe a decade or 

3664
02:45:58,350 --> 02:46:02,341
two away from no one ever having secrets
ever from everyone understanding 

3665
02:46:03,161 --> 02:46:05,800
everyone's motivation,
being able to read people's minds.

3666
02:46:06,390 --> 02:46:11,390
I think we're.
We're getting closer and closer to each 

3667
02:46:11,390 --> 02:46:14,711
other in some ridiculous way through 
technology and that's what's going on 

3668
02:46:14,711 --> 02:46:16,310
with these people that you would've 
never chosen to communicate with.

3669
02:46:16,311 --> 02:46:18,530
Reach out and fuck with you.
You know,

3670
02:46:18,531 --> 02:46:20,480
whether it's through twitter or facebook
or what have you.

3671
02:46:20,840 --> 02:46:23,810
I think that we're going to come to a 
point in time where,

3672
02:46:24,020 --> 02:46:28,340
and not too far away from now what we're
going to share thoughts and some sort of

3673
02:46:28,341 --> 02:46:33,341
a weird way that's not going to be as 
simple as like reading something on 

3674
02:46:33,710 --> 02:46:37,700
Reddit or you know,
facebook or instagram.

3675
02:46:37,850 --> 02:46:40,640
It's going to be way more complex.
It's going to be.

3676
02:46:40,670 --> 02:46:45,670
We're going to have you seen that thing 
that they did where they did an 

3677
02:46:45,670 --> 02:46:45,670
experiment where they,
um,

3678
02:46:45,670 --> 02:46:49,820
they hooked these people up to some sort
of a brain detecting device,

3679
02:46:49,830 --> 02:46:52,190
implanted electrodes on their head and 
they,

3680
02:46:52,270 --> 02:46:56,660
they sent words through the Internet,
across the world.

3681
02:46:57,010 --> 02:47:02,010
Like instantaneously these people on the
other side of the world receive these 

3682
02:47:02,010 --> 02:47:03,110
words and knew what the person was 
saying,

3683
02:47:03,590 --> 02:47:07,310
like brain to brain communication.
You haven't seen that?

3684
02:47:07,311 --> 02:47:08,990
I have not.
And that's crazy.

3685
02:47:08,991 --> 02:47:09,940
It's not,
man,

3686
02:47:09,970 --> 02:47:10,790
I,
I'm not.

3687
02:47:11,210 --> 02:47:13,490
I don't totally understand how they did 
it.

3688
02:47:13,820 --> 02:47:16,820
I think they can only do it with crude 
words right now.

3689
02:47:16,821 --> 02:47:17,510
Like,
yes,

3690
02:47:17,511 --> 02:47:18,950
no,
you know,

3691
02:47:18,951 --> 02:47:23,951
you suck like those kinds of thoughts 
because I think they,

3692
02:47:24,590 --> 02:47:29,590
you identify in your head what that word
means and you commit to that thought and

3693
02:47:31,731 --> 02:47:33,830
then they can transmit that thought 
pull,

3694
02:47:33,831 --> 02:47:35,900
pull up that study.
Because I don't understand it

3695
02:47:35,990 --> 02:47:40,990
binary.
I think it turn that word into a binary 

3696
02:47:40,990 --> 02:47:41,960
code of some kind of transmitted that 
one zero on offs to you.

3697
02:47:41,961 --> 02:47:46,961
And then you know what?
There was only a couple of things they 

3698
02:47:46,961 --> 02:47:46,961
had in it,

3699
02:47:46,961 --> 02:47:49,440
so they knew what it was because of the 
binary.

3700
02:47:49,840 --> 02:47:51,930
It's our hello or something like that.
Shower.

3701
02:47:51,940 --> 02:47:53,490
Hello or goodbye.
We'll do.

3702
02:47:53,830 --> 02:47:58,160
Did they just play the flight of the 
conchords song about the Binary Solo?

3703
02:47:58,161 --> 02:47:58,980
Do you think that's what it is?

3704
02:47:59,660 --> 02:48:01,170
Oh Man,
I love those guys.

3705
02:48:02,190 --> 02:48:06,120
New Zealand's are my favorite.
New Zealand is a nice gentle people.

3706
02:48:06,210 --> 02:48:11,210
It's a sweet spot,
but they're trying to getting fucked 

3707
02:48:11,210 --> 02:48:14,031
over over there.
Stole all his money and they're trying 

3708
02:48:14,031 --> 02:48:14,220
to import or export them to the United 
States,

3709
02:48:14,240 --> 02:48:17,010
deport them rather.
That's a weird situation.

3710
02:48:17,020 --> 02:48:21,630
Honda Mega upload situation because a,
he didn't,

3711
02:48:21,660 --> 02:48:26,660
you know,
he's never even been to America and 

3712
02:48:26,660 --> 02:48:28,671
they're trying to bring them to America 
for some alleged crimes against these 

3713
02:48:28,671 --> 02:48:31,410
alleged movie companies where people 
were uploading videos.

3714
02:48:31,710 --> 02:48:33,240
It's very,
very complex,

3715
02:48:33,600 --> 02:48:38,600
but it's also like I would like to know 
like what percentage of that site was 

3716
02:48:38,600 --> 02:48:43,191
being used for that and what percentage 
of it was being used for people just 

3717
02:48:43,191 --> 02:48:43,830
uploading things.
I don't totally understand how he was.

3718
02:48:43,860 --> 02:48:46,740
Were people paying like a subscription 
fee?

3719
02:48:46,780 --> 02:48:48,450
I don't know either.
I don't know either.

3720
02:48:48,480 --> 02:48:50,250
Sometimes when people make a lot of 
money,

3721
02:48:50,251 --> 02:48:50,580
you're like,
well,

3722
02:48:50,581 --> 02:48:51,680
how did that just happen?

3723
02:48:51,700 --> 02:48:56,700
Okay.
A company in Barcelona called star lab 

3724
02:48:56,700 --> 02:48:59,541
described transmitting short words like 
chow and coded as binary digits between 

3725
02:49:00,361 --> 02:49:02,520
the brains of individuals on different 
continents,

3726
02:49:02,521 --> 02:49:05,550
both sides.
Both studies use a similar setup.

3727
02:49:05,690 --> 02:49:10,690
This the sender of the war in Iraq,
electro and cephalgia graphic cap that 

3728
02:49:12,031 --> 02:49:17,031
captured electrical signal generated by 
his cortext while he thought about 

3729
02:49:17,031 --> 02:49:21,230
moving his hands or feet.
These signals were then sent over the 

3730
02:49:21,230 --> 02:49:23,730
Internet to a computer that translated 
them into jolts delivered to a recipient

3731
02:49:23,940 --> 02:49:28,260
recipients brain using a magnetic coil.
In Star labs case,

3732
02:49:28,261 --> 02:49:32,430
the recipient perceived a flash of light
in the University of Washington case.

3733
02:49:32,431 --> 02:49:37,431
The magnetic poles caused an involuntary
twitch of the wrist over a touchpad to 

3734
02:49:37,651 --> 02:49:41,430
shoot a rocket into a computer game.
Whoa.

3735
02:49:41,970 --> 02:49:46,970
See where we're getting to this weird 
place in technology and the the.

3736
02:49:47,511 --> 02:49:50,640
The ability that we have to manipulate 
technology,

3737
02:49:50,641 --> 02:49:55,641
but the ability to manipulate matter and
information that's going to make haters 

3738
02:49:56,551 --> 02:49:57,090
online.

3739
02:49:57,090 --> 02:49:58,800
It's gonna be.
It's gonna be ridiculous.

3740
02:49:58,801 --> 02:50:03,801
This is a temporary pitstop like an 
adolescent stage and the communication 

3741
02:50:03,801 --> 02:50:08,781
that we're enjoying and it's what it is,
is if you look back at watch game of 

3742
02:50:08,781 --> 02:50:13,401
thrones,
send a raven the only typical fucking 

3743
02:50:13,401 --> 02:50:13,401
rave and tie a message through his leg,
you know,

3744
02:50:13,401 --> 02:50:17,990
that was like the only way you get a 
message to somebody that is ridiculous 

3745
02:50:17,990 --> 02:50:21,390
now and I think these ideas of texts and
tweets and all that stuff,

3746
02:50:21,420 --> 02:50:25,050
it will be ridiculous in the future 
because we'll just have something that's

3747
02:50:25,051 --> 02:50:27,990
far more satisfying.
Far more direct.

3748
02:50:28,140 --> 02:50:29,880
You'll understand sarcasm,
you're gonna.

3749
02:50:29,881 --> 02:50:34,881
Understand when someone's fucking.
You ever get a text from someone you 

3750
02:50:34,881 --> 02:50:34,881
know,
like,

3751
02:50:34,881 --> 02:50:34,881
are you fucking with me as this of 
really mad at me?

3752
02:50:34,881 --> 02:50:35,310
Are you fucking with me?
Right?

3753
02:50:35,570 --> 02:50:37,350
And then you have to say,
are you fucking with me?

3754
02:50:37,351 --> 02:50:38,150
And they're like,
totally,

3755
02:50:38,210 --> 02:50:43,210
totally no,
not serious or just joking around and 

3756
02:50:43,210 --> 02:50:45,531
sometimes they are serious,
but they're pretending they're not 

3757
02:50:45,531 --> 02:50:45,531
serious.
You're going to be able to feel that

3758
02:50:45,531 --> 02:50:47,970
right now you're saying that we could 
wake up one day and I'll be like,

3759
02:50:47,971 --> 02:50:50,430
I'll be thinking we should get coffee 
and you'll be thinking that.

3760
02:50:50,431 --> 02:50:55,431
That sounds great.
You show up at your house with coffee 

3761
02:50:55,431 --> 02:50:59,490
even.
How about butter conversation 

3762
02:50:59,490 --> 02:50:59,490
nootropics,
nootropics,

3763
02:50:59,490 --> 02:51:02,250
nootropics.
That was close with his memory.

3764
02:51:02,340 --> 02:51:03,420
Is that it?
Oh yeah.

3765
02:51:03,440 --> 02:51:04,290
From shawnee.
Parker.

3766
02:51:04,291 --> 02:51:09,291
Kligerman soon.
Something with those whose a bunch of 

3767
02:51:09,291 --> 02:51:09,291
different nootropics that'll help with 
memory.

3768
02:51:09,291 --> 02:51:09,291
But,
uh,

3769
02:51:09,291 --> 02:51:14,090
we've done two double blind placebo 
controlled tests on it with the Boston 

3770
02:51:15,480 --> 02:51:16,470
Institute of Memory,
Boston Center for memory.

3771
02:51:16,860 --> 02:51:18,060
And um,
they showed.

3772
02:51:18,061 --> 02:51:20,250
Can you not remember the name of the 
center?

3773
02:51:20,470 --> 02:51:25,170
Um,
that we've got work left to do.

3774
02:51:25,320 --> 02:51:26,250
It's not important to me.

3775
02:51:28,350 --> 02:51:30,570
For me,
I use like names.

3776
02:51:30,571 --> 02:51:32,640
I don't remember people's names.
Mike Baab.

3777
02:51:32,850 --> 02:51:34,320
Tim.
It's not important.

3778
02:51:34,380 --> 02:51:35,310
It's like that,
that dude,

3779
02:51:35,490 --> 02:51:36,110
you know,
like,

3780
02:51:36,130 --> 02:51:38,850
love that.
But when something's important to me,

3781
02:51:38,970 --> 02:51:40,610
I've never fucking forget it.
Right?

3782
02:51:40,730 --> 02:51:43,440
Like,
like what I do like UFC commentary and I

3783
02:51:43,441 --> 02:51:45,840
started talking about past fights.
I don't have notes.

3784
02:51:46,470 --> 02:51:49,920
Those aren't just from my head.
I just remember fights.

3785
02:51:49,980 --> 02:51:50,910
Good for you.
You remember?

3786
02:51:51,240 --> 02:51:56,240
I've probably called like 1500 
professional fights at least and I just 

3787
02:51:56,881 --> 02:51:58,790
remember it was just Rolodex.
It's in there.

3788
02:51:58,800 --> 02:52:02,280
I don't remember all of them.
Sometimes I have to research or go back,

3789
02:52:02,340 --> 02:52:04,890
but I remember most of them,
most of the big ones,

3790
02:52:04,910 --> 02:52:08,380
most the ones by the memories of weird 
thing,

3791
02:52:08,381 --> 02:52:08,830
man,
you know,

3792
02:52:08,831 --> 02:52:10,410
I went to this thing the other day.
My daughter had this,

3793
02:52:10,450 --> 02:52:14,620
a dance recital and uh,
she had been to the same place two years

3794
02:52:14,621 --> 02:52:18,010
before and I'd only been there once and 
as I was walking there I was like,

3795
02:52:18,011 --> 02:52:18,610
where do I go?

3796
02:52:18,670 --> 02:52:19,930
Oh yeah,
I'll go over here.

3797
02:52:19,931 --> 02:52:21,880
Like all of a sudden my brain went,
Yay,

3798
02:52:21,881 --> 02:52:23,250
let me pull those files up.
Right.

3799
02:52:23,330 --> 02:52:24,650
You gotta go over here.
And I was like,

3800
02:52:24,670 --> 02:52:29,670
thinking as I was walking I was like,
how weird is this that my brain is just 

3801
02:52:29,670 --> 02:52:33,301
pulling these files up now?
Because if it wasn't for this recital 

3802
02:52:33,301 --> 02:52:35,890
that I had to go do,
I would never remember shit.

3803
02:52:36,220 --> 02:52:40,570
But for whatever reason your brain can 
like reach back and find those files and

3804
02:52:40,571 --> 02:52:44,830
pull them out when necessary.
For now it'll keep them for like,

3805
02:52:44,860 --> 02:52:49,860
it's like sort of like tweets.
Someone sends you a direct message in 

3806
02:52:49,860 --> 02:52:53,341
twitter,
twitter cleans those out after six 

3807
02:52:53,341 --> 02:52:53,341
months or something.
Like you don't need this anymore.

3808
02:52:53,341 --> 02:52:54,670
Trying to save.
So this was an important.

3809
02:52:54,970 --> 02:52:56,710
Kicked this out of here.
You know,

3810
02:52:56,740 --> 02:53:01,740
I think that's also going to be one of 
the things that gets resolved with a 

3811
02:53:01,740 --> 02:53:03,790
technology.
I think the way we memorize things now,

3812
02:53:03,791 --> 02:53:06,730
it's like really crude and it doesn't 
work that good.

3813
02:53:06,940 --> 02:53:11,940
I think they're going to,
we're going to be able to record things 

3814
02:53:11,940 --> 02:53:14,140
that you see directly to some sort of 
medium,

3815
02:53:14,200 --> 02:53:16,780
like whether it's a SD card or whatever 
the fuck it is.

3816
02:53:17,140 --> 02:53:19,840
And you're going to be able to share 
experiences with someone else.

3817
02:53:20,050 --> 02:53:21,520
You're going to be.
Your wife was like,

3818
02:53:21,700 --> 02:53:22,780
hey,
how was work today?

3819
02:53:22,781 --> 02:53:27,781
Like,
well why don't you fucking live it 

3820
02:53:27,781 --> 02:53:27,781
bitch?

3821
02:53:27,781 --> 02:53:29,620
You put the card in her.
Yeah.

3822
02:53:29,621 --> 02:53:30,790
And she's like,
oh my God,

3823
02:53:30,791 --> 02:53:35,791
I just jumped a fucking school bus over 
the top of a bridge and flames were 

3824
02:53:35,791 --> 02:53:35,791
shooting out of it.
Yeah,

3825
02:53:35,791 --> 02:53:36,930
that's what I did at work today.
Yeah,

3826
02:53:37,330 --> 02:53:38,830
pretty good.
Pretty good day.

3827
02:53:38,831 --> 02:53:41,890
Were cutting.
That's going to be crazy.

3828
02:53:41,920 --> 02:53:43,420
Yeah.
We're gonna put,

3829
02:53:43,421 --> 02:53:45,310
you know,
the roots really bumming me out.

3830
02:53:45,570 --> 02:53:50,570
And what's going to bum me out as an 
automotive enthusiast as you are as 

3831
02:53:50,570 --> 02:53:51,550
well.
Is He self driving cars?

3832
02:53:51,870 --> 02:53:53,110
So strange,
isn't it?

3833
02:53:53,290 --> 02:53:54,280
Well it isn't.
It isn't.

3834
02:53:54,520 --> 02:53:57,580
I think we need it because I think a lot
of assholes drive like shit.

3835
02:53:58,180 --> 02:53:59,800
But man,
it's going to be a bummer when you can't

3836
02:53:59,801 --> 02:54:04,801
just go for a ride up the fucking 
angel's crest highway and just blah 

3837
02:54:04,801 --> 02:54:06,820
blah.
Just just have fun.

3838
02:54:06,821 --> 02:54:10,830
Just go drive and you know,
roll the window down and feel it just.

3839
02:54:11,350 --> 02:54:16,350
Or is it possible it will make driving 
for people like us even better because.

3840
02:54:17,230 --> 02:54:19,150
No,
in three minutes.

3841
02:54:19,151 --> 02:54:20,170
Okay.
No one else.

3842
02:54:20,171 --> 02:54:25,171
Like if,
if all the people that suck at driving 

3843
02:54:25,171 --> 02:54:27,200
in autonomous cars in,
we're just in the left lane in fast 

3844
02:54:27,200 --> 02:54:27,520
cars,
won't that be better?

3845
02:54:27,790 --> 02:54:29,740
Yeah.
Maybe if you have to like,

3846
02:54:30,320 --> 02:54:35,320
you know,
like every tanner foust guy is allowed 

3847
02:54:35,320 --> 02:54:35,320
to drive whatever the fuck you want.
Right.

3848
02:54:35,320 --> 02:54:37,030
Because he has such tense,
right?

3849
02:54:37,240 --> 02:54:40,870
Because like my 53 plymouth,
you can't,

3850
02:54:40,871 --> 02:54:44,170
there's no way you could make a computer
big enough to drive that thing yourself.

3851
02:54:44,200 --> 02:54:49,200
Do you think we'll ever get to a point 
where you're not allowed to drive those 

3852
02:54:49,200 --> 02:54:49,200
cars?
So I get some weird laws in California,

3853
02:54:49,300 --> 02:54:54,300
like one of the reasons why people like 
older cars because you don't have to 

3854
02:54:54,300 --> 02:54:54,300
smog them.
Hell yes.

3855
02:54:54,300 --> 02:54:59,190
But look at Mexico City,
that fucking picture that I showed you 

3856
02:54:59,190 --> 02:55:01,831
today,
that's what happens when you let people 

3857
02:55:01,831 --> 02:55:03,350
not small their cars or you have too 
many cars and we don't want that.

3858
02:55:03,730 --> 02:55:03,960
So

3859
02:55:03,980 --> 02:55:08,980
like where do you draw the line?
I mean there's only a certain amount of 

3860
02:55:08,980 --> 02:55:11,201
19,
69 Chevelle that are available in the 

3861
02:55:11,201 --> 02:55:11,201
world,
you know?

3862
02:55:11,201 --> 02:55:11,900
And you've got to find one of those in 
order to have a 19,

3863
02:55:11,901 --> 02:55:13,160
69 Chevelle.
That's it.

3864
02:55:13,161 --> 02:55:14,330
They don't make them anymore.
Totally.

3865
02:55:14,450 --> 02:55:16,850
And if you want to build a new 19,
69 Chevelle,

3866
02:55:16,851 --> 02:55:17,670
well guess what,
bitch,

3867
02:55:17,680 --> 02:55:19,730
that's gotta get smog.
That's not going to be the same.

3868
02:55:20,310 --> 02:55:22,280
But I think that,
you know,

3869
02:55:22,490 --> 02:55:25,050
there's good and there's bad,
you know,

3870
02:55:26,010 --> 02:55:28,580
it's not clean.
It seems like if you've been drinking,

3871
02:55:28,581 --> 02:55:31,300
it's a genius idea,
right?

3872
02:55:31,310 --> 02:55:34,460
Just drop me off at home parking garage.
That sounds awesome.

3873
02:55:34,520 --> 02:55:39,520
But imagine if you were in that self 
driving car and you're safe and sound 

3874
02:55:39,520 --> 02:55:43,400
and some Dick Wad in a fucking Mustang 
is going who?

3875
02:55:43,401 --> 02:55:48,401
And again in right on the corner,
just doing a standard burned out at the 

3876
02:55:48,401 --> 02:55:48,401
stoplight.

3877
02:55:48,401 --> 02:55:49,700
Boom.
He smashes into you.

3878
02:55:50,330 --> 02:55:51,110
You know?
Then you're like,

3879
02:55:51,111 --> 02:55:56,111
well,
everybody should be in these fucking 

3880
02:55:56,111 --> 02:55:56,111
driverless cars.
God Damn it.

3881
02:55:56,111 --> 02:55:56,300
Didn't crash.
One of those Google cars though.

3882
02:55:56,780 --> 02:55:58,960
There's been some confirmation that the 
Google cars,

3883
02:55:58,990 --> 02:56:00,990
they've actually crashed.
So they're not.

3884
02:56:01,000 --> 02:56:02,240
They're not perfect yet.
They're not.

3885
02:56:02,720 --> 02:56:06,650
But they've probably crashed a lot less 
than the people that work for Google.

3886
02:56:06,950 --> 02:56:08,600
Right?
To Shay.

3887
02:56:09,320 --> 02:56:11,930
Now see that?
That's a stat.

3888
02:56:11,931 --> 02:56:13,350
I don't want to wonder.
Hmm.

3889
02:56:13,560 --> 02:56:18,560
Out.
Just because you're good with a laptop 

3890
02:56:18,560 --> 02:56:18,560
doesn't mean you're good with the camry.
Dude,

3891
02:56:18,560 --> 02:56:18,790
I had a great time talking to you,
but once you're having me,

3892
02:56:18,860 --> 02:56:20,210
thanks for being on.
We got to do this again.

3893
02:56:20,270 --> 02:56:21,980
That was great.
What's funny is I was like,

3894
02:56:21,981 --> 02:56:26,390
how long are some of these?
This was three hours flew by man.

3895
02:56:26,391 --> 02:56:27,770
Thanks for having.
Thanks for being on,

3896
02:56:27,771 --> 02:56:28,550
man.
I really appreciate it.

3897
02:56:28,550 --> 02:56:30,260
And I enjoy your show.
And when can people watch?

3898
02:56:30,261 --> 02:56:31,360
It's on the history channel.
Yeah.

3899
02:56:31,370 --> 02:56:34,040
So we just ran our season of lost in 
translation,

3900
02:56:34,041 --> 02:56:39,041
so we'll go back to work.
It looks like into the summer on top 

3901
02:56:39,041 --> 02:56:41,351
gear.
They'll take a little while to make and 

3902
02:56:41,351 --> 02:56:41,351
then hopefully we'll do more.
I'm lost in translation and,

3903
02:56:41,351 --> 02:56:46,011
and see me every weekend on NBC a 
starting in July for all our nascar 

3904
02:56:46,011 --> 02:56:50,141
covered.
And what is your twitter handle is at 

3905
02:56:50,141 --> 02:56:50,540
rutledge would rut leg.
Beautiful.

3906
02:56:50,930 --> 02:56:55,930
All Right Ladies and gentlemen,
we'll be back tomorrow with hypnotist 

3907
02:56:55,930 --> 02:56:58,010
vinny shoreman demand that uh,
Joe Schilling was telling me about.

3908
02:56:58,100 --> 02:57:00,620
Is he going to hit and ties me?
I'm going to tell you if this shit works

3909
02:57:01,250 --> 02:57:02,950
so you guys much love.
Thanks buddy.

3910
02:57:02,960 --> 02:57:07,960
Appreciate it.
Mm.

3911
02:57:17,040 --> 02:57:17,100
Yeah.
