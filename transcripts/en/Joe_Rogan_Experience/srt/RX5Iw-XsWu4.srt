1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:03,070
Boom,
and we're live.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,140
There's a lot of rich people in the 
world,

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,000
but it's not a lot of rich people live 
in like you.

4
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:08,740
So first of all,
before we even get started,

5
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:12,520
I salute you sir,
because if I was a 16 year old kid and I

6
00:00:12,521 --> 00:00:16,030
won the lottery,
I'd be living exactly the way you live.

7
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,520
Like if you asked a 16 year old kid,
hey man,

8
00:00:18,521 --> 00:00:20,410
if you had 100 million bucks,
what would you do?

9
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,670
Oh Dude,
I just have,

10
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:23,920
I just have bitches around me all the 
time.

11
00:00:23,921 --> 00:00:28,921
I'd be jet skiing,
I'd be driving around in Ferrari's and 

12
00:00:28,921 --> 00:00:29,600
private jets.
You live in like a,

13
00:00:29,601 --> 00:00:31,810
a life that doesn't even seem real.
It's A.

14
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,430
Does it seem real to you?

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,450
Um,
now it seems normal.

16
00:00:35,451 --> 00:00:37,940
As crazy as that sounds.
I've been doing it for awhile,

17
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,720
but that's actually kind of exactly what
I did.

18
00:00:41,721 --> 00:00:46,721
I was um,
I think it started in maybe like 2000,

19
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:47,990
11,
12.

20
00:00:47,991 --> 00:00:52,991
So I had a girlfriend for about two or 
three years and she was pretty happy 

21
00:00:53,211 --> 00:00:55,250
that she was a playmate.
She had like 100,000

22
00:00:55,251 --> 00:00:58,700
followers and she was going to move to 
La to become famous and this and that.

23
00:00:58,701 --> 00:01:03,530
And we ended up breaking up and I 
actually ended up getting a place in San

24
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:08,530
Diego.
Then I got a place in La and I started 

25
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,061
playing this real big poker and I mean I
beat one guy for like $54 million and 

26
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:12,650
then I'd be another guy for like 10 and 
you know,

27
00:01:12,651 --> 00:01:15,830
so there's some pretty big Christ.
Yeah,

28
00:01:15,831 --> 00:01:16,590
like,
you know what I'm saying,

29
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,640
it's just like there are some pretty big
wins there.

30
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:23,090
And uh,
and I was single and I was just like,

31
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,110
you know what,
fuck it.

32
00:01:24,111 --> 00:01:26,210
I'm just Kinda Kinda like do bucket list
shit.

33
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:31,211
Like whatever,
like whatever I wanted to do when I was 

34
00:01:31,211 --> 00:01:31,211
a kid,
I'm just going to fucking deal,

35
00:01:31,211 --> 00:01:34,340
you know.
And I just did and I posted about it and

36
00:01:34,341 --> 00:01:39,341
it was like,
part of the posting was because I knew 

37
00:01:39,341 --> 00:01:39,710
it'd be able to get me some pussy 
without like actually speaking to girls,

38
00:01:39,711 --> 00:01:44,711
which was good.
And then there's like another piece of 

39
00:01:44,711 --> 00:01:44,960
it where it was kind of like a fuck you 
to her,

40
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,710
but it was never like really to become 
famous,

41
00:01:48,711 --> 00:01:53,711
you know what I mean?
It was just kinda like just doing my 

42
00:01:53,711 --> 00:01:53,711
thing and you know,
we're getting pictures here and there.

43
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,780
Uh,
and then it kind of,

44
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,180
I mean fuck it's,
you know,

45
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,770
I mean I sent you some of the stats.
I mean I think like a week ago,

46
00:02:00,771 --> 00:02:03,760
like I fuck,
I reach a $175 million people.

47
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,380
Just those insane you sent me,
uh,

48
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:11,630
some,
some measurement of all the different 

49
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,050
people that are looking at your stuff.
And I'll read it because it's insane.

50
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,970
Analytics.
Yeah.

51
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,690
Like it doesn't even make sense.
These,

52
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:23,010
it's hundreds of millions of people here
will see hidden hundred 61 million,

53
00:02:23,011 --> 00:02:24,150
300,
4,000,

54
00:02:24,151 --> 00:02:29,151
941 impressions this week.
That's insane.

55
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:31,650
Grant,
you know,

56
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:34,470
like facebook's a whole nother thing.
And,

57
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:35,160
and,
and,

58
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:40,350
and it's really underrepresented because
first of all everybody else is buying 

59
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,270
all their followers and the likes and 
all their shifts.

60
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:46,450
So there's this like really inflated and
also I actually kind of like the 

61
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,560
opposite because I got a lot of people 
that are looking at my shit.

62
00:02:47,561 --> 00:02:49,420
They can't really be seen looking at my 
shit,

63
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,730
you know what I mean?
Like there was like some big producer,

64
00:02:51,731 --> 00:02:54,730
I won't say his name,
but like every time I posted a girl,

65
00:02:54,731 --> 00:02:56,890
like they get hit up in the D and this 
is like a big,

66
00:02:56,891 --> 00:02:57,570
big,
like,

67
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,080
you know,
like fucking,

68
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,160
like $100,
million

69
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,130
dollar movies and shit.
And he's like,

70
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,370
hits them all up,
you know.

71
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:08,470
So there's like a lie.
It just stopped me out like this 

72
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,260
Marsianno this fucking guy is like every
time I posted chick she's got a guest 

73
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:11,400
campaign now,
you know.

74
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,510
So it's like,
it's kind of funny,

75
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:14,770
you know,
it's great for them to.

76
00:03:14,771 --> 00:03:19,771
Then what,
what I'm saying is they're not actually 

77
00:03:19,771 --> 00:03:21,490
like officially fall and click that 
button on my shit.

78
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,630
They're stocking you.
Target.

79
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:28,640
Yeah.
So they hit that search button and 

80
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:28,640
you're at the top of the list always 
because they're always searching you.

81
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,990
That's funny.
Seems like.

82
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:35,100
So how long has this been going on?
When did you start making all these 

83
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,131
crazy posts?
And when did this gambling rampage 

84
00:03:38,131 --> 00:03:38,131
start?
Um,

85
00:03:38,131 --> 00:03:38,410
well,
I mean I've been here

86
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,220
gamble for a long time,
but um,

87
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,280
I think kind of the craziness I would 
say started in 2012 probably.

88
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,840
I just distinctly remember because I,
I won like $11,

89
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:54,250
million bucks in a night and my buddy 
who I just give them like $2,000

90
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:58,100
to made me a million off it because he 
got second in the world series of poker.

91
00:03:58,101 --> 00:03:59,420
So I had like a $12,000,000
a week.

92
00:03:59,421 --> 00:04:00,200
So I was like,
fuck it,

93
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:05,500
I'm going to take this dude down to 
Puerto Vallarta with a bunch of chicks 

94
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:05,500
and we're going to have fun,
you know.

95
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,140
And that was Kinda like,
um,

96
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,900
that was,
that was one of the big.

97
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,230
Actually not,
I'm sorry,

98
00:04:09,231 --> 00:04:14,231
I take that back.
I'd broken up with my girlfriend and it 

99
00:04:14,231 --> 00:04:15,080
was a buddy of mine,
nick cassavetes,

100
00:04:15,081 --> 00:04:17,270
who he's like know he's pretty big.
Uh,

101
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:19,560
he did like the notebook and blow and 
you know,

102
00:04:19,561 --> 00:04:22,280
like the director or whatever.
And um,

103
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:26,390
I played poker with him a lot and I just
broke it up my girl and I was like,

104
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:27,680
Hey,
let's go down to Cabo,

105
00:04:27,681 --> 00:04:29,960
I'm going to bring some chicks.
And it was supposed to be me,

106
00:04:29,961 --> 00:04:34,961
him and one other guy and the other guy 
ended up bailing but he had committed so

107
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:38,030
he paid for his part of the trip.
So it was me and nick and I think it was

108
00:04:38,031 --> 00:04:40,250
like,
I want to say 17 chicks.

109
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,640
I remember I had sex nine times in one 
day.

110
00:04:43,641 --> 00:04:44,990
I was like,
so proud of myself,

111
00:04:44,991 --> 00:04:46,340
right.
I think by the end I was like,

112
00:04:46,341 --> 00:04:48,580
it was like dust was coming out.
It was like,

113
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:52,070
it was funny because I didn't even want 
to have sex the night time,

114
00:04:52,071 --> 00:04:54,830
but it was just kinda like a,
like a matter of principle.

115
00:04:54,831 --> 00:04:58,100
It's like have a billion a billionaires 
walking down the street and he sees $100

116
00:04:58,101 --> 00:04:58,890
bill.
He says,

117
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,410
always going to pick it up.
You know what I mean?

118
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,660
That was me.
I didn't get a lot of pussy when I was 

119
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:05,660
younger.
So it was like,

120
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:05,660
it was a hot chick,
fuck.

121
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,010
We like,
I didn't care about wanting to beggars,

122
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,810
just like obligation.
So 17 girls.

123
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,120
Yep.
Now the pay these girls to come.

124
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:17,440
Okay.
So that's the big misconception on 

125
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:17,440
addressing that.
On my app.

126
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,990
I actually nap,
I've got an APP coming out and I'm just 

127
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,900
going to basically,
but you know what,

128
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,460
I'll give it to you for free,
you know?

129
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:28,520
So um,
I'm not opposed to paying for sex,

130
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,060
you know,
like,

131
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,100
I mean I have in the past like I've,
you know,

132
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,530
fuck thousands of girls.
So it's like,

133
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,530
you know,
and I paid for maybe like 10 or 20,

134
00:05:36,531 --> 00:05:41,531
something like that.
And it's not because I have any moral 

135
00:05:41,531 --> 00:05:43,070
dilemma about it and it's not because I 
think it's wrong.

136
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:44,120
Um,
in fact,

137
00:05:44,121 --> 00:05:49,121
I think like sex for money is one of the
most like pure interactions because the 

138
00:05:49,121 --> 00:05:49,310
guy gets what he wants,
the girl gets what she wants.

139
00:05:49,311 --> 00:05:54,311
There's no bullshit.
I think like this whole like sugar 

140
00:05:54,311 --> 00:05:56,561
daddy,
sugar baby thing is the biggest fucked 

141
00:05:56,561 --> 00:05:59,381
up part because then the guy's like 
pretending to like the girl pretending 

142
00:05:59,381 --> 00:05:59,381
he's not

143
00:05:59,381 --> 00:06:00,950
fucking other girls.
The girls pretending to like him.

144
00:06:00,951 --> 00:06:05,951
It's just like all this like convoluted 
bullshit is prostitution at the end of 

145
00:06:05,951 --> 00:06:07,190
the day,
like it is paying for sex.

146
00:06:07,191 --> 00:06:12,191
Right.
But they're not coming out and saying 

147
00:06:12,191 --> 00:06:12,191
it.
It's not like,

148
00:06:12,191 --> 00:06:12,191
hey,
I want x and I'll give you why.

149
00:06:12,191 --> 00:06:14,300
It's like the guy from the clippers,
donald sterling and that girl.

150
00:06:14,301 --> 00:06:15,510
Come on man,
these are all,

151
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,560
they all have like,
you know,

152
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:23,561
these five girlfriends there supporting 
them and then the girls have other 

153
00:06:23,561 --> 00:06:23,561
boyfriends.
They don't tell,

154
00:06:23,561 --> 00:06:24,800
you know,
and it's this whole fucked up thing.

155
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:26,870
But like I said,
but for me,

156
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:28,250
like I said,
it's not a moral thing.

157
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:30,620
It's not a.
I mean for me it's not a monetary thing.

158
00:06:30,621 --> 00:06:33,680
Obviously I'd much prefer to just give a
girl money fucker and be done.

159
00:06:33,681 --> 00:06:38,681
But for me,
if the girl's not into me then I'm just 

160
00:06:38,681 --> 00:06:39,980
like kind of not into the sex.
So that's the hangup for me.

161
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,120
But no,
I,

162
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,770
I,
that's actually healthy.

163
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,420
Yeah,

164
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,190
I mean it is.
I mean make these big judgments there.

165
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:53,230
They're going to make big judgments on 
you first of all because you're doing 

166
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,300
some stuff that's just like so far to 
the right end of the spectrum.

167
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,850
It doesn't even make sense.
Like how the fuck is he pulling all this

168
00:06:56,851 --> 00:06:57,850
off?
It doesn't.

169
00:06:57,851 --> 00:07:01,480
It's like it seems unattainable,
so they're gonna make well he's this guy

170
00:07:01,481 --> 00:07:04,070
is wrong and these gi would never do 
that.

171
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,890
They're saying a bunch of crazy shit 
because the way you're living is just so

172
00:07:07,891 --> 00:07:09,450
bizarre.
But at the end of the day,

173
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:14,490
that's the thing,
like people just can't wrap their hands 

174
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:14,490
around the fact that like,
you know,

175
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:14,490
they,

176
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,450
because so many guys are paying right 
now,

177
00:07:16,451 --> 00:07:21,451
like people are tricking off in record 
numbers because of instagram and all 

178
00:07:21,451 --> 00:07:22,210
this stuff and the access that people 
have like

179
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,780
tricking off being,
paying for,

180
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:28,040
paying for sex in like record numbers.
Like it's unbelief.

181
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,540
First of all,
it should be legal,

182
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,280
just like getting a massage should be 
legal.

183
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,020
No,
nobody wants to rub your feet.

184
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:38,250
Nobody wants to suck your Dick,
but it should be able to pay both of 

185
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,661
them.
It's the oldest profession like since 

186
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:40,661
the history of time.
It is.

187
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:40,661
It is.
Well,

188
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:45,521
not only that,
they taught chimpanzees the value of 

189
00:07:45,521 --> 00:07:48,200
currency that gave chimpanzees coins and
they gave them coins and then every time

190
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:51,590
the chimps had given the coins to back 
to the people that give them candy.

191
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:54,620
You know the chimps did the first 
fucking thing they did.

192
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,570
They gave the coins,
the female chimps,

193
00:07:56,571 --> 00:07:59,420
and they fucked up surveys.
That's the first thing they did,

194
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,930
and the researchers like Jesus.
That is number one.

195
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,980
The first thing they did,
that's what it added.

196
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:07,070
Another layer.
I used to have a little bit about it.

197
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:13,470
It's nothing.
There's nothing wrong with it and like 

198
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,990
making pleasure.
A crime is ridiculous.

199
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,540
There's no victim,
no one's getting her.

200
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:21,440
Think of all the shitty jobs that you 
can get paid to do.

201
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:26,470
You can get paid to clean toilets.
You can get paid to fucking insulate 

202
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:30,071
addicts.
There's a lot of terrible jobs that you 

203
00:08:30,071 --> 00:08:31,450
can get paid to mop up the.
Come on a fucking on the floors of these

204
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:31,890
like,
you know,

205
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:34,050
jerk houses or the place or whatever,
you know,

206
00:08:34,051 --> 00:08:34,940
it's,
it's like,

207
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,300
I don't know.
I,

208
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:39,020
like I said,
I have no issues with it.

209
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,820
I think it should be legal.
Um,

210
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,430
it's a victimless crime.
Yeah.

211
00:08:43,431 --> 00:08:43,800
I just

212
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,040
like for,
like I said,

213
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,150
for me it's,
it's the,

214
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,270
it's the mental thing and I just like,
I,

215
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,920
I got,
I couldn't fuck all the girls,

216
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,340
you know,
if I had five dicks.

217
00:08:52,341 --> 00:08:53,290
So it's like,
what?

218
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:55,980
And I'm not like bragging like

219
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,090
I used to,
I'm just,

220
00:08:57,091 --> 00:08:58,620
you know,
I'm just kicking you the real deal,

221
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,630
you know?
It's like I should.

222
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:02,690
I said,
there's no victims.

223
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,570
I kissed.
There is some,

224
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,730
there's victims of some prostitution,
right?

225
00:09:05,731 --> 00:09:10,731
There's a people that are abducted and 
there's certain people that are like sex

226
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:12,780
traffic,
like sex slaves.

227
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,430
That's real,
but we're not talking about it

228
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:17,300
that we're talking about.
That's exactly what you said,

229
00:09:17,301 --> 00:09:18,440
that,
that sex slavery,

230
00:09:18,441 --> 00:09:20,270
that's not really like a girl saying,
hey,

231
00:09:20,271 --> 00:09:22,010
I want x for y.
that's her saying,

232
00:09:22,011 --> 00:09:27,011
hey,
you got to do this and you're getting 

233
00:09:27,011 --> 00:09:27,011
your ass beat.

234
00:09:27,011 --> 00:09:27,060
There's a big way,
bigger difference,

235
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:32,100
a big difference between that and a lot 
of what you see in La as these girls,

236
00:09:32,101 --> 00:09:37,101
they want to wear the nice purses and 
have nice shoes and they don't really 

237
00:09:37,101 --> 00:09:41,241
want a job and they want to live in a 
nice apartment but they don't want to 

238
00:09:41,241 --> 00:09:42,000
work.
How do I work this out?

239
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:44,120
And by the way,
getting back to your last thing,

240
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:46,850
if it was legal,
there wouldn't be,

241
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:47,780
you know,
the pimp saying,

242
00:09:47,781 --> 00:09:48,920
hey,
you're going to do this.

243
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:49,880
You're gonna.
Get your ass beat.

244
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:54,910
It will all be regulated just like drug 
dealers and also then than the 

245
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:54,910
beginning,
you know,

246
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:59,560
tested and you know,
they're just be like a whole regulated 

247
00:09:59,560 --> 00:09:59,560
system.

248
00:09:59,560 --> 00:09:59,560
Exactly.
I mean,

249
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,710
as much as I hate pain pills and as much
as I have lost friends to pain pills and

250
00:10:02,711 --> 00:10:07,711
oxides and all this different shit,
there's no fucking wars being fought 

251
00:10:07,711 --> 00:10:11,821
over it.
There's not blood in the streets of war 

252
00:10:11,821 --> 00:10:11,821
as Mexico over pain pills.
You know,

253
00:10:11,821 --> 00:10:13,180
all that shit is over drugs that are 
illegal.

254
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:18,450
As soon as those drugs become legal,
I think probably less people would use 

255
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:22,231
them and you'd get tax dollars from them
and the least there would be some sort 

256
00:10:22,231 --> 00:10:25,921
of a solution in terms of treatment and 
responsibility and he'd be able to look 

257
00:10:25,921 --> 00:10:26,530
at it a little bit differently.

258
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:32,030
Yeah.
I just think there's too much money and 

259
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:32,030
kickbacks for that to happen,
but I,

260
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:32,030
I totally agree.
I mean,

261
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:35,800
I think alcohol is far worse for you 
than many drugs and I mean,

262
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:40,801
you know,
I mean how many times have you seen 

263
00:10:40,801 --> 00:10:41,310
people get into fights or shoot people 
or you know,

264
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,340
wreck their cars because they're high on
al or high on weed,

265
00:10:44,341 --> 00:10:45,270
you know,
it never happens.

266
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,860
Never happens on alcohol,
you know,

267
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:49,860
more people are dying from alcohol 
related deaths and there are firearms,

268
00:10:49,861 --> 00:10:51,240
but they want to ban the guns,
you know?

269
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:51,830
Yeah.
It's,

270
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,820
there's,
there's a lot of real problems with that

271
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,220
for sure.
And you know,

272
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:59,610
there's also these companies like the 
company that makes a fentanyl fentanyl,

273
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:04,950
it's super strong pain pill,
a painkiller that's 10 times at least 

274
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:07,560
more powerful than a oxycontin's.
I believe that's what the numbers,

275
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,920
they're spending $500,000
just to keep marijuana illegal in 

276
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,470
Arizona because they're,
you know,

277
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:18,490
they've got it on the ballot to make it 
recreationally legal in the state of 

278
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:21,531
Arizona and so they're putting out all 
these ads and they have this whole 

279
00:11:21,531 --> 00:11:23,940
campaign to try to sway people,
but they're just doing it for business.

280
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:27,150
It has nothing to do with public safety 
or health.

281
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,130
You see a fucking thing about Hillary 
Clinton.

282
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,560
One of the Wiki leaks things that 
Hillary Clinton,

283
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:37,310
she.
Wikileaks released some paper where she 

284
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:40,761
was in communication with bankers,
one of the emails and she was saying 

285
00:11:40,761 --> 00:11:42,620
that she was going to stop weed and that
she was going to make sure that we're,

286
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,400
uh,
was not legal.

287
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,700
Then she was gonna,
do her best and stand her ground.

288
00:11:47,701 --> 00:11:51,840
And all this nonsense leak reveals 
Clinton promise bankers to stand against

289
00:11:51,841 --> 00:11:53,170
marijuana legalization.
Like,

290
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,940
what the fuck?
Hillary.

291
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:57,130
She's pretty brutal.
Just what the fuck.

292
00:11:57,131 --> 00:12:00,760
I know you're bought and sold,
but don't you have enough money,

293
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,770
lady,
how much money you need?

294
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:04,750
Unless you're gambling with Dan 
Bilzerian,

295
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,180
where the fuck's all your money going?
I read.

296
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,250
It's kind of funny because what did they
pay these presidents like 250 k a year,

297
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,230
$400,000
a year and they're all worth hundreds of

298
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,360
millions of dollar or billionaires,
you know,

299
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:16,330
it's insane.
Yeah.

300
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:17,520
Well,
not only that,

301
00:12:17,521 --> 00:12:19,680
like she was trying to say that once 
bill got out of the office,

302
00:12:19,681 --> 00:12:21,240
he was dead broke.
Well,

303
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:26,241
you're not dead broke now,
so how the fuck did you guys make all 

304
00:12:26,241 --> 00:12:26,241
that money that they're worth hundreds 
and hundreds of millions of dollars.

305
00:12:26,241 --> 00:12:31,230
It's all from speaking arrangements and 
pay to play and weird fucking shady 

306
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:35,991
deals they have with banks and they do 
these speeches that nobody wants to 

307
00:12:35,991 --> 00:12:38,040
fucking here and they pay him a quarter 
million bucks an hour.

308
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,200
So preposterous.
Yeah.

309
00:12:40,201 --> 00:12:40,600
I mean,

310
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,780
the more money you have and the more you
kind of rub shoulders with these people,

311
00:12:43,781 --> 00:12:45,880
you kind of get a look behind the 
curtain and you see that,

312
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:46,960
you know,
it's just uh,

313
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,870
it's,
I mean politics.

314
00:12:49,871 --> 00:12:51,670
If you look up the definition of 
politics,

315
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:52,960
I mean it's like bullshitting,
right?

316
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,800
Well that is being political is not 
being yourself,

317
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,630
which is the opposite of what you're 
doing.

318
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:02,290
I mean you're kind of like an anti 
politician it a lot of ways,

319
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:06,540
but do you want to get at though is do 
you get hit up because you're,

320
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:11,541
you're so wealthy.
Do you get hit up by people that are in 

321
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,690
the political spectrum that want to use 
your influence and your.

322
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,090
You have,
how many followers do you have?

323
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,800
A 19 point something on instagram and 
it's 10 and a half million on facebook 

324
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,710
and twitter.
Twitter,

325
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:26,810
but I mean that's insane.
The whole UFC.

326
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,710
Yeah.
The reach is tracking

327
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,890
point 2 million followers.
That's crazy.

328
00:13:31,891 --> 00:13:34,110
And it's all just pictures of you 
grabbing titties.

329
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,430
Like,
look at this one right here.

330
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,380
This is what?
This one's hilarious.

331
00:13:37,381 --> 00:13:39,750
It's like someone told you that you 
shouldn't.

332
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,910
You should post something a little more

333
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,020
team is like,
you got to clean this up.

334
00:13:44,021 --> 00:13:44,660
You know,
like,

335
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:46,930
you know there's a new team.
Fuck your team.

336
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:51,150
Like there's all this money out there.
You know,

337
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,870
you know this,
this,

338
00:13:52,871 --> 00:13:55,110
uh,
this rocky got paid $70,

339
00:13:55,111 --> 00:13:57,880
million bucks to indoors for the,
like you can make all this money.

340
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,170
Yeah.
Oh,

341
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:00,790
what do you do with it?
Just drive a truck.

342
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,670
A big truck.
It does afford a commercial $70 million.

343
00:14:03,671 --> 00:14:08,671
It's probably worth it though for them.
The Rock has like $67 million or some 

344
00:14:08,671 --> 00:14:09,380
insane shit,
but he's a goddamn movie star.

345
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,200
Do two takes pictures with.

346
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,630
That's a thing,
you know,

347
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:17,670
like I feel like I got to be maybe the 
most famous guy that never had like a TV

348
00:14:18,411 --> 00:14:21,440
show or like a real talent.
One hundred percent.

349
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:27,090
No one even close.
That's kind of rare to be like number 

350
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:27,090
one and anything,
you know.

351
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:27,370
So that's kind of cool.
You're the number one baller.

352
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,630
Well I don't know about that from 
America.

353
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,480
We're the number one power.
I'm giving you the crown right now.

354
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,610
Burger King,
crown.

355
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,880
I put it on your head.
I can tell you some stories about some 

356
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,700
guys that know who you are when nobody 
knows who they are.

357
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:46,510
Public ball for sure.
I'm the only guy that's kind of putting 

358
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:46,510
it out there because,
you know,

359
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,350
most guys they got,
they got a job,

360
00:14:47,351 --> 00:14:48,770
they get a wife,
the family,

361
00:14:48,771 --> 00:14:49,550
you know,
whatever.

362
00:14:49,551 --> 00:14:51,350
I just Kinda just said fuck all of it,
you know,

363
00:14:51,351 --> 00:14:52,220
like they can accept

364
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,140
me or not and I,
I'm just going to do it all.

365
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,910
How old are you?
Thirty five.

366
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:01,300
Do you think that there's gonna come a 
day when this is going to be tired and 

367
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:01,700
if you,
if it does come a day,

368
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:03,860
do you think you're ever going to go the
marriage route?

369
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,290
Is that possible at this point?
So look,

370
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,630
you know,
I'm a gambler.

371
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,140
I don't want to bet half of my net 
worth.

372
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:10,160
I'm a lucky girl forever,

373
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:15,180
but that's not to say that I wouldn't 
have a girlfriend or you know what I'm 

374
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:15,910
capable of being monogamous.

375
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,210
Um,

376
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,420
you know,
it's just for me it's more about options

377
00:15:20,421 --> 00:15:21,570
really.
Look at the end of the day,

378
00:15:21,571 --> 00:15:26,571
it comes down to most guys earn 
relationships I feel like because it's 

379
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:27,950
either,
hey,

380
00:15:27,951 --> 00:15:31,040
I'm going to jerk off on Saturday night 
or I've got to put up with her shit.

381
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:31,940
And I get laid,
you know,

382
00:15:31,941 --> 00:15:34,100
and it's like in a lot of,
it's out of laziness.

383
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:36,590
A lot of it's not a lack of options,
whatever the case may be,

384
00:15:36,591 --> 00:15:38,690
but it's not correct.
Like for me,

385
00:15:38,691 --> 00:15:41,570
I think a correct relationship as a guy 
that could be fucking,

386
00:15:41,571 --> 00:15:46,571
you know,
five or 10 girls and he chooses to hang 

387
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:48,941
out with this one girl because he likes 
her and he likes hanging out with her 

388
00:15:48,941 --> 00:15:49,220
and she hangs out with him because she 
enjoys his company.

389
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,650
And regardless of what the reason is,
you know,

390
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:52,890
because a lot of people are like,
Oh,

391
00:15:52,891 --> 00:15:57,891
you know,
that girl's a gold digger or they want 

392
00:15:57,891 --> 00:15:57,891
to hate on them.
Um,

393
00:15:57,891 --> 00:16:01,420
but you know,
at the end of the day if a guy has made 

394
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:04,790
his money from successful business and,
you know,

395
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:08,420
being smart and,
and he hasn't fucked it off like,

396
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,920
you know,
or he's a doctor,

397
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:12,470
whatever.
That to me is more of a part of who that

398
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,510
guy is.
Then a girl that's just born hot.

399
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,240
So for a guy to like a girl just because
she's hot,

400
00:16:17,241 --> 00:16:19,580
I feel like it's like the most 
superficial thing of all time.

401
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,450
Well,
I mean chess would be nice to.

402
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,430
She can't.
I mean hopefully she does,

403
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:29,460
but I'm saying a lot of guys are with a 
girl just because she's hot and they 

404
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:33,241
don't really get as much shit as a girl 
that's with a guy because he's 

405
00:16:33,241 --> 00:16:33,241
successful because he has money.

406
00:16:33,241 --> 00:16:33,560
It's true.
It is true.

407
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,960
It is true.
Like the guy who earned that money,

408
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:40,220
it's his character and his willpower and
his discipline that's allowed him,

409
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:43,340
his smarts is allowed him to earn that 
money or he just got lucky as fuck.

410
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,260
And there's definitely some lucky ones 
but

411
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,030
you know,
you also have to hold onto it.

412
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:52,390
I mean once you got money,
I mean you got every asshole and their 

413
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:52,390
mother with their handout,
you know,

414
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,660
trying to scam you and it's easy to,
you know,

415
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:54,710
fuck it off or

416
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,410
you know,
make bad investments or you know,

417
00:16:57,411 --> 00:16:58,740
whatever the case might be.
Yeah,

418
00:16:58,741 --> 00:16:59,200
it is.
That's,

419
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,470
it is a funny little situation there,
isn't it?

420
00:17:01,471 --> 00:17:06,471
Because like it's also the way women are
allowed to dress even like a,

421
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:13,040
like a respectable woman is allowed to 
have her tits pressed together and 

422
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,360
pushed up and she's allowed to have a 
skirt that's just like a little,

423
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,850
a little light,
vagina curtain,

424
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,350
you know,
and it's really all it is.

425
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:22,560
Little panties underneath and smooth 
legs and high heels.

426
00:17:22,561 --> 00:17:25,710
I mean the whole thing is sex selling,
lust.

427
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:29,820
Let's talk about bathing suits and the 
fact that every bathing suit now,

428
00:17:29,821 --> 00:17:34,560
is it basically a thong and the fact 
that like a bathing suit shows more than

429
00:17:34,561 --> 00:17:36,930
like the most revealing underwear back 
in the day.

430
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:41,990
Ever used to,
but it's like completely socially 

431
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:44,601
acceptable.
Then on Halloween they could wear even 

432
00:17:44,601 --> 00:17:44,601
less than that.
They paint.

433
00:17:44,601 --> 00:17:44,601
Okay.
Yeah.

434
00:17:44,601 --> 00:17:45,570
It's like literally,
but naked.

435
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,980
When the fuck did paint become close,
magically put on our deck and went

436
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:50,970
out.
You'd get arrested,

437
00:17:50,971 --> 00:17:55,971
right?
Well how come a girl can wear on tits 

438
00:17:55,971 --> 00:17:55,971
became,
were paying on your Dick?

439
00:17:55,971 --> 00:17:57,540
I want to know.
I want to know.

440
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,830
Oh,
that's a double standard.

441
00:17:58,831 --> 00:18:01,050
It is a double standard.
Nobody wants to see your Dick painted it

442
00:18:01,051 --> 00:18:03,690
up.
That's why especially with like American

443
00:18:03,691 --> 00:18:04,700
flag or something.
Yeah.

444
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:09,000
I don't want to see a bunch of zebra.
It is weird.

445
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:14,020
There are weird double standards,
but it's also people don't want to open 

446
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:14,020
their mouth because they don't want.
First of all,

447
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,450
they don't want anybody to think that 
they,

448
00:18:15,451 --> 00:18:16,910
you know,
like why do women get do is not,

449
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,630
oh,
what are you complaining?

450
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,920
Poor guy,
you know,

451
00:18:19,921 --> 00:18:24,921
you don't want to hear that.
But it's also when men complain about 

452
00:18:24,921 --> 00:18:27,390
the double standard in like,
like marriage,

453
00:18:27,391 --> 00:18:30,000
like what you said as far as it being a 
gamble.

454
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,890
It's a terrible gamble for a wealthy 
man.

455
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,030
It's terrible because it's,
it's essentially a financial agreement.

456
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:37,440
It's not a love agreement.

457
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,440
Well No,
you're asking the government permission 

458
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,620
to be with a girl and if you decide that
you don't want to be with them,

459
00:18:43,621 --> 00:18:48,621
now you have to go ask the government 
and then you have to get lawyers 

460
00:18:48,621 --> 00:18:51,591
involved.
And it's this whole process that in my 

461
00:18:51,591 --> 00:18:52,140
eyes it makes both parties field.
Well,

462
00:18:52,141 --> 00:18:53,640
not both parties because usually,
you know,

463
00:18:53,641 --> 00:18:56,070
it's kind of like a magnet,
like one is pushing a little bit further

464
00:18:56,071 --> 00:18:56,610
than,
than the other.

465
00:18:56,611 --> 00:18:59,340
And so there's one kind of like always 
chasing or whatever.

466
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:03,480
So for me it just makes the party that's
a little bit less invested,

467
00:19:03,481 --> 00:19:08,481
just feel trapped.
And when you're in a relationship and 

468
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:08,481
you feel trapped,
the first thing you want to do is run,

469
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:09,780
right?
So you've got this one person,

470
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:14,781
you know,
that inevitably ends up feeling trapped 

471
00:19:14,781 --> 00:19:16,770
and the other person you know,
kind of gets lazy or complacent.

472
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,480
And I feel like it just snowballs,
you know,

473
00:19:18,481 --> 00:19:20,340
there's like a lot of momentum things,
right?

474
00:19:20,341 --> 00:19:25,341
So if relationships just starts kind of 
going downhill and you're trapped in it 

475
00:19:25,341 --> 00:19:29,421
because you're legally bound,
I just feel like it's just gonna get 

476
00:19:29,421 --> 00:19:32,661
worse and worse and the girl is going to
stop giving them blowjobs and the guy's 

477
00:19:32,661 --> 00:19:32,661
going to resent it and then maybe he 
cheats.

478
00:19:32,661 --> 00:19:37,340
You know what I mean?
It's like this whole cycle that just 

479
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,711
wouldn't happen if you were hanging out 
because he wanted to hang out because 

480
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:39,711
let's face it,
if you're,

481
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:40,110
if you're hanging out with the chicken,
you like her,

482
00:19:40,111 --> 00:19:45,111
she's cool and then she just decides to 
just completely let herself go and she 

483
00:19:45,111 --> 00:19:48,561
turns into a fat ass and or she just 
like stopped wanting to have sex and 

484
00:19:48,561 --> 00:19:51,941
you're just going to fuck other girls or
you're just not going to hang out with 

485
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:51,941
it.
Right.

486
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,010
But if you're married to or you don't 
really have a choice.

487
00:19:53,011 --> 00:19:55,590
I mean now you're kind of like,
you got to ask the government permission

488
00:19:55,591 --> 00:19:56,610
and you know,
this and that.

489
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,050
Yeah.
You got to get lawyers involved.

490
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,470
You live in the same place.
You gotta Oh,

491
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:05,490
it takes forever.
You have to agree on terms and you have 

492
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:06,190
to pay for her lawyer.
Do you mean how brutal is that?

493
00:20:06,191 --> 00:20:09,360
Like you're like literally like trapped 
in the same house as the birth,

494
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,160
you know,
it's just like,

495
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:16,180
it can get crazy,
it can get crazy and I've seen it get 

496
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:16,180
crazy.
I'm sure you have to.

497
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:20,550
When people get divorced,
I mean it is one of the most stressful 

498
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:23,110
things a person go through in their life
and when you're working,

499
00:20:23,111 --> 00:20:26,020
you're working all day and if she's not 
working,

500
00:20:26,021 --> 00:20:31,021
that's when it's really crazy.
I had a buddy who was going through a 

501
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:31,540
divorce,
his wife never worked and he was working

502
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,770
10,
12 hours a day,

503
00:20:32,771 --> 00:20:37,771
just busting his ass constantly as his 
own business and she would be fucking 

504
00:20:37,771 --> 00:20:39,310
off and doing whatever she wanted during
the day.

505
00:20:39,311 --> 00:20:43,420
He had to pay for all that on top of 
paying for her lawyer and her lawyer was

506
00:20:43,421 --> 00:20:48,421
trying to fuck him and then he had to 
pay for his lawyer to paddle her and 

507
00:20:48,421 --> 00:20:48,421
they all

508
00:20:48,421 --> 00:20:53,160
just dragged the whole thing out.
Took over a year and a half for him to 

509
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:53,160
get divorced.
Suffix,

510
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,730
a year and a half.
This poor bastard just means free now,

511
00:20:54,731 --> 00:20:57,070
but God damn,
but try to get them married now.

512
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,980
He'll fucking shoot you in the face if 
you even bring up that word.

513
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:05,090
It's like he went through it.
I mean they have a term for it and 

514
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:05,260
gambling.
It's a negative free role.

515
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,810
It's where you can basically only lose,
you have no upside.

516
00:21:07,811 --> 00:21:08,890
You know,
like for instance,

517
00:21:08,891 --> 00:21:12,520
a negative free roll is like if I were 
to tell you,

518
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,530
hey,
um,

519
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,520
you know,
if you can go bench press 300 pounds,

520
00:21:15,521 --> 00:21:18,730
I'll give you $10,000.
Well I just can't win anything,

521
00:21:18,731 --> 00:21:23,731
you know what I mean?
Because if you can't do it then I don't 

522
00:21:23,731 --> 00:21:23,731
get anything.
So it's Kinda like in my eyes,

523
00:21:23,731 --> 00:21:27,631
I just feel like as a situation where 
you can just lose its kinda like my 

524
00:21:27,631 --> 00:21:31,591
buddy he got into a relationship and he 
just dove in like super hardcore really 

525
00:21:31,591 --> 00:21:35,611
fast and I just told them,
I said look like I just feel like you 

526
00:21:35,611 --> 00:21:36,370
don't have a lot of upside by doing that
because you know,

527
00:21:36,371 --> 00:21:39,220
you can get hurt and if you just take it
slow,

528
00:21:39,221 --> 00:21:40,960
like worst case scenario,
you know,

529
00:21:40,961 --> 00:21:43,150
you just weren't quite as close for a 
month.

530
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:44,050
But I said,
you know,

531
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:49,410
if it doesn't work out then now you 
invested all this time and this effort 

532
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:54,240
and it's like.
And I feel like because he went so 

533
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,600
hardcore for this girl,
it Kinda like,

534
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:01,500
you know,
sometimes it makes them run away a 

535
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:01,500
little bit because they know people,
you know,

536
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,330
they just by nature want what,
they can't have rights.

537
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,230
If you just give it all to him 
immediately,

538
00:22:05,231 --> 00:22:07,150
then it's Kinda like,
like look at this bitch.

539
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,020
Yeah,
exactly.

540
00:22:08,021 --> 00:22:09,970
The kind of like lose respect for you a 
little bit.

541
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,030
It can happen or it can be perfect.
You know,

542
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:15,160
relationships just have to be organic.
That's what it really has to be.

543
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,320
And as soon as you involve legal 
contracts,

544
00:22:17,321 --> 00:22:18,890
it's not organic anymore.
Exactly.

545
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:24,220
Once it,
once I feel like once it starts to be 

546
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:24,220
forced in anyway,
you know,

547
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,230
then well it's when there's no 
prenuptial to.

548
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:28,420
That's when things get really screwy.
You know,

549
00:22:28,421 --> 00:22:30,520
when you find out how much people 
actually have to pay.

550
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,320
Like I've talked about it on my podcast 
before,

551
00:22:32,321 --> 00:22:36,160
but I have another buddy who's paying 
his ex wife for the rest of her life.

552
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,980
They were married for 12 years.
He has to pay her forever.

553
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:39,990
Forever.
Yeah.

554
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,740
She's got a new boyfriend.
He's married,

555
00:22:41,741 --> 00:22:44,200
he's got kids now with another woman to 
the most brutal part.

556
00:22:44,201 --> 00:22:49,201
It's when they,
when they get to the boyfriend and now 

557
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:49,201
you're like support and this dude to 
bang your wife.

558
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:53,190
Not only that,
the dude lives in his house and every 

559
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:53,430
time they send a lawyer over to check 
the date,

560
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:55,210
the guy packs up his stuff.
It's like a joke.

561
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:58,330
He throws it in a u haul.
He drives around the corner,

562
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:03,480
waits for the inspector to leave,
goes all the way around and brings the 

563
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:03,480
shit back.

564
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,870
It's fucking insanity because you know,
he's got this baller house in the 

565
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:09,200
palisades is living with this girl and 
the only way she gets screwed up because

566
00:23:09,201 --> 00:23:11,500
if she marries this guy,
but this guy doesn't have any money,

567
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,380
so she's never going to marry this guy.
I mean she would,

568
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:17,050
she would have to bank on marrying this 
guy would be worth,

569
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:22,080
I think my buddy pays or somewhere 
around a half million dollars a year 

570
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,190
forever.
Forever for life.

571
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,560
So they've been,
were married for 12 years,

572
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:31,600
had been divorced for 15.
So He's been paying her longer than they

573
00:23:31,631 --> 00:23:36,631
were married.
Just want to just fucking jump off a 

574
00:23:36,631 --> 00:23:36,820
bridge,
but that's,

575
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:37,860
you know,
like I said,

576
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:38,980
negative fruit.
I just,

577
00:23:38,981 --> 00:23:40,360
I don't see the upside.
Right.

578
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,580
What's so rare that it works out the 
other way.

579
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:46,280
It's so rare that a woman has to pay a 
man and it's one of those things where

580
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:51,340
it's like men are being victimized left 
and right by this and when you talk to 

581
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:51,740
people about their.
I was like,

582
00:23:51,741 --> 00:23:52,270
Oh,
you will.

583
00:23:52,271 --> 00:23:53,510
You fucked up.
Well,

584
00:23:53,511 --> 00:23:54,410
you shouldn't have done it.
Well,

585
00:23:54,411 --> 00:23:55,960
you should've got a prenup.
Well,

586
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:56,810
okay.
Maybe.

587
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,310
Maybe you could say all those things.
Yes,

588
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:03,311
maybe it was a mistake,
but it was obviously a mistake under 

589
00:24:03,311 --> 00:24:04,310
the,
the whole spell of love.

590
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:09,730
And to have this be a financial 
entanglements that can trap you in this 

591
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:10,880
one I'm talking about.
My friend doesn't even have any kids.

592
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:14,460
He didn't have any kids with this lady,
so it's,

593
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,650
it's insanity.
It's just,

594
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,350
it's just a robbery.
It's just a legalized robbery.

595
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,940
And I was having this conversation with 
a buddy of mine who is married.

596
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:22,850
He's like,
wow,

597
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,140
you know,
I don't look at it that way.

598
00:24:24,141 --> 00:24:25,250
I go,
look at it this way,

599
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:29,390
the the business of divorce and it is a 
business.

600
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:31,070
Whenever there's money involved in 
something,

601
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:36,100
there's a bunch of people that try to 
figure out how to extract that money of 

602
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,991
the lawyer.
The only money is in taking the money 

603
00:24:38,991 --> 00:24:38,991
from the rich guy.
That's where the money comes from.

604
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,990
That's the only way you get the money.
You don't get the money.

605
00:24:41,991 --> 00:24:45,740
If the girl doesn't make much money and 
everybody wins.

606
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,870
If the rich guy gets fucked.
So if the.

607
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:52,900
If the legal battle for the divorce last
two years as opposed to two minutes,

608
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:58,600
everybody gets paid.
The both lawyers on both sides make a 

609
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,691
substantial amount of money.
The woman gets a substantial amount of 

610
00:25:01,691 --> 00:25:04,001
money.
The guy gets fucking drain like a 

611
00:25:04,001 --> 00:25:04,790
vampire and that's what happens 
predominantly.

612
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:08,330
Yeah.
Which is usually the outcome of a lot of

613
00:25:08,331 --> 00:25:10,910
times when a rich guy gets involved in 
anything is yeah,

614
00:25:10,911 --> 00:25:15,911
he gets drained and that's kind of goes 
back to my previous point of why I feel 

615
00:25:15,911 --> 00:25:17,840
like women that are attracted to guys 
that are successful,

616
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:23,160
you know,
it makes sense because there's just so 

617
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:23,160
many people trying to take that 
motherfucker down,

618
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,070
you know,
like when you're at the top of the hill,

619
00:25:25,071 --> 00:25:25,600
like,
you know,

620
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,170
everybody wants to,
you know,

621
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,760
get out there and bringing it down while
it's nature.

622
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:34,910
I mean it's just like a moose having a 
fucking giant set of antlers.

623
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:35,990
All the other moods.
Like,

624
00:25:35,991 --> 00:25:37,120
oh,
look at those antlers.

625
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:42,360
And I mean it's just,
it is a thing that exists in all 

626
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,670
different species.
I mean there's no,

627
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:47,300
there's no denying that.
When a guy pulls up in a Rolls Royce and

628
00:25:47,301 --> 00:25:52,301
he flies into his own private jet,
he does a bunch of things that nobody 

629
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:52,301
else can do,
that people just go,

630
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:56,760
oh,
and women automatically genetically get 

631
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,950
attracted to that guy for some strange 
reason.

632
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,770
There is you,
you are buddy bawling,

633
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:01,880
bawling,
out of control.

634
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:05,060
How did you get all your money 
originally?

635
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:11,370
So that's another common misconception 
and I didn't really,

636
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:17,950
I didn't really talk about it or,
or saying anything about it just because

637
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:20,890
it helped me out so much in poker.
Um,

638
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,590
but everybody just thought that I was,
you know,

639
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:23,770
rich trust fund,
idiot.

640
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:26,200
Um,
and then my parents gave me all my money

641
00:26:26,201 --> 00:26:29,860
so that actually allowed me to get into 
a lot of these poker games.

642
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,050
Um,
because they thought you were a fish.

643
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,430
Yeah,
it's like a weird thing.

644
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:35,020
Um,
it's not just that,

645
00:26:35,021 --> 00:26:40,021
but in poker I've noticed that if a guy 
loses money to another guy and he knows 

646
00:26:42,011 --> 00:26:47,011
that that money's going to,
that other guy out or his quality of 

647
00:26:47,011 --> 00:26:47,011
life is going to be improved by that 
money.

648
00:26:47,011 --> 00:26:49,080
It really fucking irritates them.
Like going.

649
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:51,060
Yeah.
And I'm guilty of it too.

650
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,760
If I lose $5,000,000
to a billionaire,

651
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:59,090
it doesn't bother me nearly as much as 
if I lose maybe a couple hundred 

652
00:26:59,090 --> 00:26:59,700
thousand to some guy that's like pretty 
broke.

653
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:02,610
And now he goes out and buys a new 
fucking car with my money.

654
00:27:02,611 --> 00:27:04,800
And I'm just like this fucking guy,
you know what I mean?

655
00:27:04,801 --> 00:27:05,220
Like,
oh,

656
00:27:05,221 --> 00:27:06,850
that's weird.
I don't know why and it,

657
00:27:06,851 --> 00:27:08,640
and it's,
it's kind of counterintuitive,

658
00:27:08,641 --> 00:27:13,641
you know.
But another thing about it is like if 

659
00:27:13,641 --> 00:27:13,641
you lose money to a guy that has a 
bunch,

660
00:27:13,641 --> 00:27:13,840
like you always think that,
you know,

661
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,480
there's a chance you could win it back 
to.

662
00:27:15,481 --> 00:27:17,670
So there's that piece of it.
Um,

663
00:27:17,671 --> 00:27:22,671
if you lose money to a guy that doesn't 
really have much and he goes out and 

664
00:27:22,671 --> 00:27:23,070
spends it will like,
you're never getting it back again.

665
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,400
Um,
yeah,

666
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:29,420
that exists in pool.
Like a lot of guys don't want to gamble 

667
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,510
with guys only have one barrel.
Go play your game pool for 100 bucks,

668
00:27:30,511 --> 00:27:32,670
but he's only got 100 bucks,
but they might have 10,000.

669
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,260
Exactly.
So you look at your upside,

670
00:27:34,261 --> 00:27:34,770
it's like,
okay,

671
00:27:34,771 --> 00:27:37,440
best case scenario,
walk away from this with this guy's last

672
00:27:37,441 --> 00:27:38,610
hundred bucks,
which to me,

673
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,170
some guys get off on that.
To me,

674
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:42,660
I don't really ever want to break a guy.
Right?

675
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:45,540
But then you look at the d,
The downswing of that is like,

676
00:27:45,541 --> 00:27:47,740
okay,
I could spend 10,000

677
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,040
trying to chase my initial hundred bucks
that I lost.

678
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,920
So you have to take that.
There's just a lot of things in gambling

679
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,190
that you've taken to account,
you know,

680
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,500
with the,
with the money management,

681
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,940
psychological things.
Yeah.

682
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:59,610
So how did you make your money then 
playing poker?

683
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:01,300
He made it all playing poker.
Yeah.

684
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,670
Wow.
That is insane.

685
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,220
So what did you do for a living before 
you played poker?

686
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:08,100
I mean,
I was in the military for four years.

687
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,550
Um,
and when I got out,

688
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,270
got honorable discharge,
I had,

689
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,180
you know,
uh,

690
00:28:13,181 --> 00:28:16,260
I was getting some disability money from
the va just because I,

691
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:18,270
you know,
I got a lot of injuries when I was going

692
00:28:18,271 --> 00:28:21,820
through buds and,
and just not even just injury,

693
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:26,830
just all the medical checks they do,
they just document all the things that 

694
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:27,780
are wrong with you so you get a 
percentage for all those things.

695
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:29,730
Kind of Shit was wrong with you.
Fuck,

696
00:28:29,731 --> 00:28:34,731
I mean,
I first time I went in and I had a 

697
00:28:34,731 --> 00:28:35,280
bilateral stress fractures so I was,
you know,

698
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:40,580
went into bugs,
have broken legs and so I was eating a 

699
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:40,580
bunch of motor and it burned a hole in 
my stomach.

700
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:45,261
I had acid reflux.
They ended up getting so bad they were 

701
00:28:45,261 --> 00:28:45,261
actually going to kick me out of the 
navy,

702
00:28:45,261 --> 00:28:47,040
gone through buds with broken legs first
I went in.

703
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:50,050
Yeah.
And nobody knew that lecture sore.

704
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:51,810
Well no I got medically dropped the 
first.

705
00:28:51,811 --> 00:28:56,811
So I mean it's kind of a long story,
but I'll try and give you the cliff 

706
00:28:56,811 --> 00:28:56,811
notes.
Um,

707
00:28:56,811 --> 00:29:01,700
so I went to bootcamp and the furthest 
I'd ever ran was like two miles and it 

708
00:29:01,831 --> 00:29:03,750
was straight out of high school because 
I got thrown in jail,

709
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,430
um,
my senior year of high school.

710
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:08,270
So I didn't graduate and get your ged.
Um,

711
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:12,180
and kids you don't need a degree.
Slim how to play poker.

712
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,710
Well we'll get to that.
So,

713
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,550
um,
end up joining the military,

714
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:20,700
go go through bootcamp in a school.
I was trying to ramp up.

715
00:29:20,701 --> 00:29:21,270
So I'm like,
fuck,

716
00:29:21,271 --> 00:29:23,880
I'm going to seal training.
I gotta I gotta start running.

717
00:29:23,881 --> 00:29:26,610
So I started running,
I got an overuse injury,

718
00:29:26,611 --> 00:29:31,611
turned into stress fracture a.
They basically put me on a medical hold 

719
00:29:31,611 --> 00:29:32,640
and my detailer said,
look,

720
00:29:32,641 --> 00:29:33,870
you can stay on this medical hold 
through,

721
00:29:33,871 --> 00:29:38,871
your legs are healed and then I'm going 
to send you to a ship for two years and 

722
00:29:38,871 --> 00:29:42,231
then you can apply or else you can get 
cleared and go straight to seal 

723
00:29:42,231 --> 00:29:42,231
training.
So I was like,

724
00:29:42,231 --> 00:29:42,760
okay,
got cleared.

725
00:29:42,761 --> 00:29:47,761
When seal training,
they dropped me the first day I had to 

726
00:29:47,761 --> 00:29:47,761
request to talk to the captain and 
finally the captain's like,

727
00:29:47,761 --> 00:29:48,250
okay,
you know,

728
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:53,460
I'll let you,
I'll let you try it because I basically 

729
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:53,460
said,
look,

730
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:53,460
just give me a shot.

731
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:53,460
I'm already here.
Like,

732
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,230
let me just train.
Um,

733
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,510
what's the worst that can happen?
I'm not going to die and you know,

734
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:58,240
break the leg worse.
So I said,

735
00:29:58,241 --> 00:30:00,160
if I make it through hell week,
just give him medical role.

736
00:30:00,161 --> 00:30:00,580
He's like,
yeah,

737
00:30:00,581 --> 00:30:01,450
sure kid,
go ahead.

738
00:30:01,451 --> 00:30:03,370
So the guy let me train.
Um,

739
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:07,210
that was actually first bet I made my 
doctor who was like a Vietnam seal.

740
00:30:07,211 --> 00:30:12,211
He's like,
he was so fucking pissed that the c CEO 

741
00:30:12,211 --> 00:30:12,211
allowed me to train.
And so he's like,

742
00:30:12,211 --> 00:30:16,801
I'll bet you a hundred bucks you don't 
make it through hell week is 100 bucks 

743
00:30:16,801 --> 00:30:16,801
or 20 bucks,
I forget which,

744
00:30:16,801 --> 00:30:18,010
but I bet the guy and I won the fucking 
money.

745
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:21,310
Um,
and three weeks after I was just,

746
00:30:21,311 --> 00:30:23,350
I mean I could barely walk,
you know,

747
00:30:23,351 --> 00:30:26,110
so I ended up getting enrolled and they 
kicked me out.

748
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:31,320
Um,
and so I went to my ship and the ship 

749
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,580
was like,
the captain of the ship wants to take me

750
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:36,070
out to see even though it's supposed to 
be on crutches.

751
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,750
So I was like,
this motherfucker.

752
00:30:37,751 --> 00:30:42,751
So after,
after going through like the hardest 

753
00:30:42,751 --> 00:30:43,450
thing and then getting dropped,
um,

754
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:47,260
now I'm on a boat and I was supposed to 
be like healing up and this guy wants to

755
00:30:47,261 --> 00:30:50,260
take me out at sea.
So go to Okinawa.

756
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:53,380
And I requested to go in to see my 
wisdom teeth.

757
00:30:53,381 --> 00:30:54,850
And then when I was there I was like,
hey,

758
00:30:54,851 --> 00:30:56,050
you know,
check my legs and like,

759
00:30:56,051 --> 00:30:57,700
okay,
we'll do a nuclear bone scan.

760
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,970
So when I was supposed to go in from an 
they said,

761
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:02,230
you know,
come back in two hours.

762
00:31:02,231 --> 00:31:05,950
So I went for a two hour run and in just
like my fucking,

763
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:08,390
not even like my,
uh,

764
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:09,330
fatigues.

765
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:12,190
It was like a work uniform.
It was like a button down shirt.

766
00:31:12,191 --> 00:31:14,050
I wear a two hour run,
took a shower,

767
00:31:14,051 --> 00:31:16,270
came back and he looked at my legs and 
I'm like,

768
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,000
your legs are fucking destroyed.
Like I can't believe you can walk.

769
00:31:19,001 --> 00:31:19,450
I'm like,
yeah,

770
00:31:19,451 --> 00:31:21,000
these motherfuckers,
you know,

771
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:22,870
and so they're gonna kick me out of the 
navy.

772
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:28,200
So it just like that was thing I was 
going to get medically discharged from 

773
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,831
the navy and it took them so long that I
actually requested to go back and I 

774
00:31:33,461 --> 00:31:38,461
just,
I'll never forget because I went in and 

775
00:31:38,461 --> 00:31:40,411
talked to the CEO of my,
it was like a limited duty security 

776
00:31:40,411 --> 00:31:41,800
detail or whatever.
And he goes,

777
00:31:41,801 --> 00:31:43,090
let me get this straight.
He goes,

778
00:31:43,091 --> 00:31:46,120
you're about to be medically retired 
from the military.

779
00:31:46,121 --> 00:31:51,121
He goes for broken legs and you want me 
to request or approval requests for you 

780
00:31:51,401 --> 00:31:52,390
to go to seal training.

781
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,730
He goes,
how fucking stupid are you?

782
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:58,720
And I was just like,
and I didn't really know what to say.

783
00:31:58,721 --> 00:32:00,970
I was or you know,
this is just like,

784
00:32:00,971 --> 00:32:02,770
he's like,
get the fuck out of my office.

785
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:04,500
And I was like,
thinking about it,

786
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:05,260
I was like,
well fuck,

787
00:32:05,261 --> 00:32:05,890
like I,
you know,

788
00:32:05,891 --> 00:32:07,990
I'm like,
he'll have been doing steroids.

789
00:32:07,991 --> 00:32:09,940
I feel great,
but fucking working out like,

790
00:32:09,941 --> 00:32:11,920
well it's been like eight months,
right?

791
00:32:11,921 --> 00:32:13,690
Like I feel like I could go do this 
again.

792
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:16,390
So I ended up pulling some strings and 
uh,

793
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:21,570
and basically I just had to get cleared 
and then I had to pray that I got sent 

794
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,500
to buds because if not it'll go to a 
ship.

795
00:32:23,501 --> 00:32:24,790
And then I had to.
It was just like,

796
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,860
it would be the biggest disaster of all 
time.

797
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,130
So that was one of my biggest gambles 
was doing that.

798
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:34,030
I'd like a free ride for the rest of my 
life medically retired.

799
00:32:34,031 --> 00:32:35,050
Like,
you know,

800
00:32:35,051 --> 00:32:36,550
I'm a disabled veteran,
like,

801
00:32:36,551 --> 00:32:41,551
you know,
all this great shit and I kinda like 

802
00:32:41,551 --> 00:32:41,551
gave it up to go back.
And um,

803
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:42,530
uh,
yeah,

804
00:32:42,531 --> 00:32:44,630
I went into his office and he goes,
he goes,

805
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:49,660
he goes,
you might be the stupidest motherfucker 

806
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:49,660
I've ever seen.
He goes,

807
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,120
he goes,
he goes,

808
00:32:50,121 --> 00:32:52,730
you just better hope that you don't end 
up back at this command.

809
00:32:52,731 --> 00:32:57,731
He could see goes,
you're going to clean fucking toilets 

810
00:32:57,731 --> 00:32:59,180
until you get discharged.
And uh,

811
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,520
yeah.
So that was,

812
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:06,060
how would they have discharge?
How would they have paid you for life 

813
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:06,060
from broken links?
I mean,

814
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:08,480
Delta legs heal up and then you're okay.
That's the thing is like,

815
00:33:08,481 --> 00:33:13,481
it just,
it had been basically since it was 

816
00:33:13,481 --> 00:33:14,780
documented because when I got out of um,
bootcamp at a school,

817
00:33:14,781 --> 00:33:18,250
I had them and I had them all through 
buds.

818
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:21,560
Where is it broken?
A bilateral tibial stress fracture.

819
00:33:21,561 --> 00:33:23,600
So my tip,
um,

820
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,250
and then that's the big one,
right?

821
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:29,330
The fibula is a smaller one.
Those in the shins.

822
00:33:29,331 --> 00:33:31,730
I don't remember which,
but I think it was the very one.

823
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:35,210
Um,
and then so all through bonds and then,

824
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,320
you know,
on the boat.

825
00:33:36,321 --> 00:33:37,430
So it was,
it was basically like,

826
00:33:37,431 --> 00:33:42,431
you know,
I had broken legs for like a year and a 

827
00:33:42,431 --> 00:33:42,431
half or a year and seven months just 
insane.

828
00:33:42,431 --> 00:33:42,920
It was basically like,
they're like,

829
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:47,921
okay,
well this guy's legs are just never 

830
00:33:47,921 --> 00:33:47,921
going to fucking.
He'll right.

831
00:33:47,921 --> 00:33:47,921
Like,
that was kind of like the military,

832
00:33:47,921 --> 00:33:48,620
his take on it was like,
okay,

833
00:33:48,621 --> 00:33:51,020
well he's been on limited duty like this
and that,

834
00:33:51,021 --> 00:33:54,260
like his leg should have healed by now 
and they just aren't,

835
00:33:54,261 --> 00:33:57,620
so what are we going to do with them?
So why wasn't it healing?

836
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:02,620
I'm still confused because I went 
through seal training that kind of 

837
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,800
fucked them up a little bit and then,
you know,

838
00:34:03,801 --> 00:34:07,340
I was on the boat and I wasn't allowed 
to use crutches.

839
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:11,210
And then I think obviously the final 
Straw was probably me fucking going on a

840
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:15,800
two hour run on a purpose.
Fuck yeah,

841
00:34:15,801 --> 00:34:17,310
I did it on purpose.
Yeah.

842
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:21,650
But what was the goal of fighting to get
the fuck off the ship?

843
00:34:21,651 --> 00:34:22,810
I said,
you know,

844
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:25,380
this capital was such a dickhead.
It's like Brah,

845
00:34:25,381 --> 00:34:27,440
I went through all this fucking pain,
you know what I mean?

846
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:30,410
Like I went through seal training,
it's like letting my legs,

847
00:34:30,411 --> 00:34:31,760
you know,
you fucking cock sucker.

848
00:34:31,761 --> 00:34:34,340
Like the guy like wanted me to like 
stand watches on the bus.

849
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:37,100
It was like Kinda like,
it's basically like a fuck you to him.

850
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:42,190
So you crushed her own legs to get off 
the boat and then try to get into seal 

851
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:42,190
training.

852
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,220
Yeah,
well it took them so long,

853
00:34:43,221 --> 00:34:48,221
you know,
took them so long to process me out of 

854
00:34:48,221 --> 00:34:49,871
the military that they had healed.
And so I was like well fuck wow that's 

855
00:34:49,871 --> 00:34:52,070
hilarious.
So just from those broken links,

856
00:34:52,071 --> 00:34:57,071
you could have been set up where you've 
got a pension forever and not only that 

857
00:34:57,071 --> 00:35:01,931
but like if you're a disabled veteran 
you get like a year eligible for a lot 

858
00:35:01,931 --> 00:35:01,931
of shit,
you know,

859
00:35:01,931 --> 00:35:04,430
if you're like medically retired,
it's kind of like,

860
00:35:04,431 --> 00:35:05,620
you know,
you went in the military,

861
00:35:05,621 --> 00:35:06,670
he tried to,
you know,

862
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,200
be in there forever and like you just 
got injured,

863
00:35:09,201 --> 00:35:11,210
you know what I mean?
So they like make a lot of,

864
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,490
you know,
allowances for people like that.

865
00:35:13,491 --> 00:35:16,280
Like I think they give you like your 
first loan on your house for free.

866
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:18,020
There's like a whole bunch of Shit,
Huh?

867
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:19,760
Yeah,
I remember because I looked into it when

868
00:35:19,761 --> 00:35:20,600
I gave it all up.

869
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:26,950
So then what happens then?
I'm so well then I went back into uh,

870
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:31,550
into bugs or field training or whatever.
Um,

871
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,690
and I,
uh,

872
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:37,810
I made it two days before graduation and
I got rolled all the way back the 

873
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:40,500
beginning and then I did the whole 
fucking thing again.

874
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:43,170
And why did you get rolled all the way 
back to the beginning?

875
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:48,770
So when I went through the second time I
kind of had the attitude of just like,

876
00:35:49,411 --> 00:35:51,870
fuck,
I've already done this shit and I just,

877
00:35:51,871 --> 00:35:53,820
you know,
also,

878
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:59,350
I don't know,
I mean I was just in great shape and I 

879
00:35:59,350 --> 00:35:59,350
just,
I wasn't worried about anything.

880
00:35:59,350 --> 00:35:59,480
So my attitude was like,
okay,

881
00:35:59,481 --> 00:36:03,350
well worst case scenario I'm just going 
to get beat and I don't really care.

882
00:36:03,351 --> 00:36:08,351
So I just would,
I just figured if I passed everything 

883
00:36:08,351 --> 00:36:11,081
and I performed well and I didn't quit,
like they couldn't kick me out so I 

884
00:36:11,081 --> 00:36:13,310
kinda didn't really like kiss ass or 
anything.

885
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:14,270
I was just like,
whatever,

886
00:36:14,271 --> 00:36:14,900
like,
you know,

887
00:36:14,901 --> 00:36:17,060
and if I fucked up it's like okay,
I'll get beat.

888
00:36:17,061 --> 00:36:17,940
Like,
you know,

889
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:21,020
I was like pretty hard dude.
I've been trained for two years,

890
00:36:21,021 --> 00:36:24,170
I'd already been through hell week and 
now I'm doing it without broken legs,

891
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:29,650
you know,
like going through with broken legs now 

892
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:29,650
I'm like,
he'll,

893
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:29,650
I'm like fuck,
you know,

894
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:33,431
like nothing could be bad now.
So it's like worth the worst that can 

895
00:36:33,431 --> 00:36:33,431
happen.
I'm,

896
00:36:33,431 --> 00:36:34,310
we get hypothermia or I'm going to have 
to do some pushups,

897
00:36:34,311 --> 00:36:39,311
like whatever.
And so I just didn't really have a good 

898
00:36:39,311 --> 00:36:39,311
attitude.
I wasn't too worried about um,

899
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:41,030
like the other guys in the class because
I figured,

900
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:42,730
you know,
would lose Mosa.

901
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:47,750
I mean started off with 239 guys and we 
came through hell week with like 34.

902
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:55,330
My first class we started with 119 and 
we came through [inaudible] 17.

903
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,440
So you're like,
you're going to lose most of these guys.

904
00:36:57,441 --> 00:36:59,090
I don't really.
I don't know.

905
00:36:59,150 --> 00:36:59,870
I,
I mean,

906
00:36:59,871 --> 00:37:01,910
I wasn't much of a team player.
I just want to graduate,

907
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:02,720
you know,
so.

908
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:04,910
So,
but how they kick you back then?

909
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:08,000
Well started,
I got one safety violation,

910
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:09,850
um,
uh,

911
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:14,690
for the instructor gave the wrong order.
We're on the range and we're facing down

912
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:17,030
range and he gave an about face and 
drop.

913
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:20,620
So half the class just did with words,
you know,

914
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:23,480
we did the about face,
we drop and now we're like pointing down

915
00:37:23,481 --> 00:37:24,140
range,
right?

916
00:37:24,141 --> 00:37:26,240
So half the class got a safety violation
for that.

917
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:31,930
And then the second one was we were 
doing I ads like these a live fire 

918
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:34,280
drills and half the classes behind the 
berm,

919
00:37:34,281 --> 00:37:39,281
the other half was doing it and then we 
switched and I was behind the berm and 

920
00:37:39,281 --> 00:37:43,421
my,
off my own berm was like a big mound of 

921
00:37:43,421 --> 00:37:43,421
dirt.

922
00:37:43,421 --> 00:37:43,640
And My,
uh,

923
00:37:43,641 --> 00:37:45,770
the officer in charge of my class,
he didn't really like me.

924
00:37:45,771 --> 00:37:48,830
So he had me on watch every single night
and he put me on the Middle Watch.

925
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,020
So out on the island,
um,

926
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:56,080
you get six hours of sleep Max if you 
fall asleep when you get off and then 

927
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,080
you wake up the second and you don't 
clean any of your gear,

928
00:37:58,081 --> 00:38:03,081
you get six hours.
So he put me on us on a watch in the 

929
00:38:03,081 --> 00:38:06,311
middle,
so I got maybe like an hour in the 

930
00:38:06,311 --> 00:38:08,921
beginning and then I just wake up for 
two hours for the watch and then maybe 

931
00:38:08,921 --> 00:38:08,921
if I could go back to bed I'd get like 
an hour,

932
00:38:08,921 --> 00:38:13,481
maybe two hours asleep.
So I was running on real low sleep and 

933
00:38:13,481 --> 00:38:13,510
um,
so I was behind the Berman.

934
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:13,940
I just,
you know,

935
00:38:13,941 --> 00:38:15,320
I fell asleep.
It wasn't a big deal.

936
00:38:15,321 --> 00:38:20,321
Most guys did.
But my crew leader didn't wake me up 

937
00:38:20,321 --> 00:38:20,321
because he didn't like me.

938
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:24,290
So now I'm technically sleeping during a
live fire drill because they did a class

939
00:38:24,291 --> 00:38:28,310
muster up fucking sleeping as the guns 
going off.

940
00:38:28,311 --> 00:38:30,020
And you're sleeping.
Yeah,

941
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,820
I mean the other guys did too.
Yeah.

942
00:38:31,821 --> 00:38:33,370
I mean we're just like,
we're sitting there because it,

943
00:38:33,371 --> 00:38:33,830
it,
you know,

944
00:38:33,831 --> 00:38:38,831
it's like 40 minutes something.
They're doing their shit and we're just 

945
00:38:38,831 --> 00:38:38,831
laying there,
we're not doing it.

946
00:38:38,831 --> 00:38:39,550
We're not supposed to be involved or you
know,

947
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:44,630
were just,
they could only have half the class in 

948
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:46,831
the range.
So half is just sitting there and then 

949
00:38:46,831 --> 00:38:46,831
the other half is doing it and fuck man.
Like,

950
00:38:46,831 --> 00:38:47,180
I mean,
dude,

951
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:49,090
during hell week I fell asleep standing 
up,

952
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:50,440
you know.
So it's like,

953
00:38:50,441 --> 00:38:51,430
yeah,
you get tired enough,

954
00:38:51,431 --> 00:38:54,430
you fall asleep like no matter what.
So.

955
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:57,150
So you came out of that.
So yes,

956
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,240
I got rolled all the way back.

957
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,430
So,
so basically they put me in front of the

958
00:39:00,431 --> 00:39:01,720
thing and,
and uh,

959
00:39:01,721 --> 00:39:03,670
and they're like,
well you got to safety violations,

960
00:39:03,671 --> 00:39:04,720
whatever.
And I was just like,

961
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,980
you know,
I was like,

962
00:39:05,981 --> 00:39:07,690
well,
I didn't really even explain.

963
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:12,810
I didn't even really like at the time 
you're so brainwashed that these guys 

964
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:13,390
are like gods.
You don't even really want to argue with

965
00:39:13,391 --> 00:39:18,391
them because they instructors.
It's like you can't even like have a 

966
00:39:18,391 --> 00:39:18,391
conversation with these guys because 
I've asked you a question.

967
00:39:18,391 --> 00:39:18,730
Like,
your answers are like,

968
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:21,220
who you are.
Like you don't even say yes or no.

969
00:39:21,221 --> 00:39:22,700
It's just like a,
you know,

970
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:28,090
so you're so like conditioned to not 
argue that I didn't really like defend 

971
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:28,180
what happened,
you know,

972
00:39:28,181 --> 00:39:33,181
because if I were to like walk in there 
and like defended like exactly like 

973
00:39:33,181 --> 00:39:33,181
look,
like half the class,

974
00:39:33,181 --> 00:39:34,420
you know,
just given the explanation,

975
00:39:34,421 --> 00:39:39,421
but I didn't really want to like argue 
with these instructors because you're 

976
00:39:39,421 --> 00:39:39,421
just so brainwashed.

977
00:39:39,421 --> 00:39:40,360
Anyways.
So I basically told him,

978
00:39:40,361 --> 00:39:40,810
I said,
look,

979
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:41,890
you know,
I don't care.

980
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:43,720
I'll go do the whole fucking thing 
again.

981
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,430
And they're like,
oh yeah.

982
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,510
I was like,
yeah.

983
00:39:46,511 --> 00:39:47,110
I was like,
oh,

984
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:52,200
I'll do the whole fucking course again.
So they rolled me all the way back and 

985
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,080
did the whole fucking thing again.
And uh,

986
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,090
and this instructor that didn't like me,
he just,

987
00:39:55,091 --> 00:39:57,610
he couldn't even find excuses.
The third time he just,

988
00:39:57,611 --> 00:40:02,611
admin dropped me.
I didn't even know that was a good 

989
00:40:02,611 --> 00:40:02,611
thing.
I didn't know you could get admin drop,

990
00:40:02,611 --> 00:40:02,890
but yeah,
I just cut

991
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:04,380
it,
made it all the way through.

992
00:40:04,381 --> 00:40:06,470
Any admin dropped.
You haven't driven the stocks,

993
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:08,910
your instagram page right now?
I don't know,

994
00:40:08,911 --> 00:40:11,200
but I think he remembers.
You have

995
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,220
probably,
probably,

996
00:40:13,221 --> 00:40:15,000
yeah,
I mean he's probably heard of me now.

997
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:19,250
I mean the seal community is definitely 
love or hate with me,

998
00:40:19,251 --> 00:40:20,870
like you know,
the guys that know me usually,

999
00:40:20,871 --> 00:40:25,871
you know,
have good things to say and the guys 

1000
00:40:25,871 --> 00:40:25,871
that don't usually all talk shit but.

1001
00:40:25,871 --> 00:40:27,610
So you get out and then what happened?

1002
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,630
So I get out.
I'm a diva for years.

1003
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:33,690
Got Out and um,
I uh,

1004
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:34,950
I went to college.
When did you,

1005
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,790
and did four years there and uh,

1006
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:41,160
my brother was like the military too.
It did four years.

1007
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:43,360
Paid my dues.
I prison.

1008
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:44,030
Yeah,

1009
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,330
no it was,
it was fun.

1010
00:40:45,331 --> 00:40:48,630
I had a great time in college.
My brother taught me how to play poker.

1011
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:53,690
I'm like the first year because I was 
getting all this money from the Va and 

1012
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:55,560
the Gi bill and I got grants.
I was eligible for everything.

1013
00:40:55,561 --> 00:41:00,561
Right.
So that's what you learn how to play 

1014
00:41:00,561 --> 00:41:00,561
poker.
Yeah.

1015
00:41:00,561 --> 00:41:01,050
My brother taught me and then I was 
planning college is playing,

1016
00:41:01,051 --> 00:41:06,051
like some online stuff.
I had a couple of fraternity brothers 

1017
00:41:06,051 --> 00:41:08,511
that were really into it and they taught
me a little bit and there's some home 

1018
00:41:08,511 --> 00:41:09,430
games and yeah,
that's,

1019
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:11,190
that's how I started.
I went broke,

1020
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,990
um,
my sophomore year,

1021
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,260
so I was just like,
it was a,

1022
00:41:16,261 --> 00:41:21,261
it was a wild ride.
I just sell some guns that went and 

1023
00:41:21,261 --> 00:41:22,180
played on a gambling boat for like a 
week and turned like this.

1024
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:27,120
I sold three guns for 750 bucks,
played on this gambling boat for a week,

1025
00:41:27,121 --> 00:41:32,121
turned into 10,000,
went to Vegas and then turn that into 

1026
00:41:32,121 --> 00:41:35,701
187,000
at Bellagio after playing for three 

1027
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:35,701
weeks straight.

1028
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:35,840
Never forget it.
Wow.

1029
00:41:35,841 --> 00:41:38,830
So that was the launching point.
One hundred and 87,000

1030
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:43,900
at the Bellagio.
Bellagio created Dan Bilzerian 

1031
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:43,900
essentially.
Yeah.

1032
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,340
Yeah.
Well they started it.

1033
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:51,640
So there you go and you just become this
crazy baller poker player character.

1034
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:53,150
Well,
I mean it was a,

1035
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:54,740
it was a slow rise,
you know,

1036
00:41:54,741 --> 00:41:55,360
I mean,
it wasn't.

1037
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,130
How long did it take?
Oh,

1038
00:41:58,540 --> 00:41:59,210
I mean,
you know,

1039
00:41:59,211 --> 00:42:01,700
that was,
I was,

1040
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:04,140
that was 2005.
You know,

1041
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:09,150
and I actually,
I mean I got really lucky I came into 

1042
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:10,720
poker at a time when nobody really knew 
how to play this fucking guy,

1043
00:42:10,721 --> 00:42:12,910
Chris moneymaker,
um,

1044
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:17,970
you know,
he turned $25 into like a two or 

1045
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:17,970
$3,000,000
win and he wasn't even that great.

1046
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:22,741
So it was like the new gold rush,
like everybody wanted to play poker 

1047
00:42:22,741 --> 00:42:22,741
rounders had just come out,
you know,

1048
00:42:22,741 --> 00:42:24,250
that's what it was fucking movie.
I remember that.

1049
00:42:24,251 --> 00:42:25,290
It was that,
you know,

1050
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,550
celebrity started playing and it was 
just like,

1051
00:42:27,551 --> 00:42:32,551
it was one of those things were and 
there wasn't really any like training 

1052
00:42:32,551 --> 00:42:35,791
tools like the game hadn't been solved.
Like even the pros weren't that good 

1053
00:42:35,791 --> 00:42:36,940
back then.
So really?

1054
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:37,990
Yeah,
I mean there wasn't,

1055
00:42:37,991 --> 00:42:40,150
it was just kinda like,
I mean back in the day,

1056
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:42,100
like the old pros,
the way they won,

1057
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:43,530
they just cheated,
you know?

1058
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:44,460
Really.
Yeah.

1059
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:46,330
I mean there was a cheat.
Oh fuck.

1060
00:42:46,331 --> 00:42:49,150
I mean there's more cards,
there's cold backs,

1061
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:50,280
there's a million ways.

1062
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:55,480
I've never played poker.
I mean I might've played once in high 

1063
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,090
school or something like that.
I've never played my friend Ari,

1064
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:59,780
Ari Shaffir,
he when he was struggling in Hollywood,

1065
00:42:59,781 --> 00:43:00,180
when he,
he's,

1066
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:02,590
he's a stand up comedian and when he 
wasn't,

1067
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,620
was just starting out,
he would make his money playing poker,

1068
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:08,360
go to poker tournaments,
and he made way more money playing poker

1069
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:10,130
than he ever did.
Doing standup.

1070
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:10,950
Yeah.
Actually,

1071
00:43:10,951 --> 00:43:12,840
I mean I'll tell you the story of how I 
dropped out of college.

1072
00:43:12,841 --> 00:43:14,470
Can I piss real quick?
Good.

1073
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,470
No worries man.
One Sec.

1074
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:17,040
Go ahead.
Right here.

1075
00:43:17,041 --> 00:43:22,041
So I drank a bunch of water.
I just want to point out Dan Bilzerian 

1076
00:43:22,041 --> 00:43:23,530
and I wear the same pants both wearing 
camo pants.

1077
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:25,750
I think he deserves it more than me 
though.

1078
00:43:25,751 --> 00:43:30,751
He went to hell week.
I've just hidden from animals three 

1079
00:43:30,751 --> 00:43:30,890
times,
but my pants are a.

1080
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:34,360
they're fake.
I mean I just bought them on Amazon.

1081
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:37,330
They're not like,
they're not like real cammo either.

1082
00:43:37,331 --> 00:43:37,930
It's something like,
cool.

1083
00:43:37,931 --> 00:43:41,830
You are first light or anything.
What a fucking character though.

1084
00:43:41,831 --> 00:43:43,360
Huh?
That's crazy shit.

1085
00:43:43,361 --> 00:43:48,361
Right?
Like a lot of people hate on that dude 

1086
00:43:48,361 --> 00:43:51,990
ever.
I've met him a couple of times and it's 

1087
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:51,990
one of the reasons why I wanted to do 
this one.

1088
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:55,290
It seems like a super nice guy,
but every time I've talked to people 

1089
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:55,480
about them,
there was a food third good food,

1090
00:43:55,810 --> 00:44:00,270
good food.
The course,

1091
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,530
of course.
I mean,

1092
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:07,920
he's like all.
I mean the fact he's not paying those 

1093
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,490
girls that I find that suspicious.
Do you find that suspicious?

1094
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:10,600
We don't.
Not really.

1095
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:11,950
I mean,
why are they there then?

1096
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:13,720
Because they can get.
They don't have shit to do.

1097
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:16,150
Don't they have jobs?
They're hot.

1098
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:17,440
Probably he loans the money.

1099
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,610
Let's leave some cash around.
Can Be.

1100
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,790
Doesn't sure.
They're getting good gigs out of it.

1101
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,580
I'm sure they're getting good gigs out 
of it.

1102
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:32,820
I mean,
look what the fuck's that guy's named 

1103
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:35,001
Corey Feldman.
He's Feldman's angels or whatever the 

1104
00:44:35,001 --> 00:44:35,001
fuck that is.
Right?

1105
00:44:35,001 --> 00:44:38,600
Hugh hefner had this.
The halfs have like show for awhile.

1106
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:39,930
Well,
the he had to pay.

1107
00:44:39,931 --> 00:44:43,430
Those girls were talking about a 
haffner.

1108
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:45,450
They're all playing.
Maybe that was,

1109
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:48,660
that was sad to me.
That was more sad to me.

1110
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:50,940
Was that the Haffner thing?
Like,

1111
00:44:50,941 --> 00:44:52,710
uh,
I could see chicks to bang you.

1112
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:54,060
Handsome guy,
thick beard,

1113
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:59,010
built no military man,
got a lot of guns.

1114
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:01,830
That makes sense.
The after thing was always like,

1115
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:03,100
oh,
those poor girls,

1116
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:08,630
I have daughters and I would,
I would think about some poor girl and 

1117
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:08,630
Hugh hefner and just going,
oh

1118
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:09,810
yeah,
but it's not just him.

1119
00:45:09,811 --> 00:45:13,650
It's Kinda like all these fashion guys.
Fashion guys.

1120
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:14,130
Yeah.
Like,

1121
00:45:14,131 --> 00:45:14,970
I mean,
you know,

1122
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,670
Paul Marsianno,
he bangs every check this and gas,

1123
00:45:17,671 --> 00:45:18,600
you know.
Oh yeah,

1124
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:19,180
okay.
Yeah.

1125
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:21,330
So I mean it's Kinda like they set it 
up,

1126
00:45:21,331 --> 00:45:21,740
right?
Like,

1127
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:27,400
I mean,
my whole thing is kind of like life 

1128
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:27,400
setup,
right?

1129
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,571
So you set up your life to where you 
don't really have to work for what you 

1130
00:45:29,571 --> 00:45:30,100
want,
right.

1131
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:31,830
So,
um,

1132
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:32,970
you know,
push for instance,

1133
00:45:32,971 --> 00:45:37,971
like if you set it up correctly,
like I mean if you buy a big brand or a 

1134
00:45:37,971 --> 00:45:41,781
modeling agency or whatever it is,
and you're providing these girls with a 

1135
00:45:41,781 --> 00:45:41,781
career,
like for instance,

1136
00:45:41,781 --> 00:45:43,110
let's,
let's use Hugh Hugh hefner.

1137
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:47,400
So if you become a playmate,
you're guaranteed $25,000.

1138
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:49,440
Um,
you now you're,

1139
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:51,180
I mean this is back in the day,
right,

1140
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:52,090
there's like,
you know,

1141
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:54,940
10 years ago and playboy was hot or you 
know,

1142
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:55,870
20,
whatever,

1143
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,000
whatever,
so now they're getting a thousand 

1144
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:01,000
dollars for appearance before they were 
getting,

1145
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:02,160
you know,
whatever,

1146
00:46:02,161 --> 00:46:03,260
but now they won't,
you know,

1147
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:06,720
you can't even show up for less than a 
grand through your guaranteed more money

1148
00:46:06,721 --> 00:46:07,080
there.

1149
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:08,760
Now you have a title,
um,

1150
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:13,860
as far as modeling,
like you're just going to book higher 

1151
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:13,860
end jobs.
There's,

1152
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:15,360
you know,
there's the playboy events,

1153
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:16,680
so it's Kinda like,
you know,

1154
00:46:16,681 --> 00:46:21,681
it's like you fuck this guy,
he'd be home playmate and now you like 

1155
00:46:21,681 --> 00:46:21,681
have a career.

1156
00:46:21,681 --> 00:46:21,681
Oh,
I get it.

1157
00:46:21,681 --> 00:46:23,370
It makes sense and I mean it makes 
sense,

1158
00:46:23,371 --> 00:46:27,750
but the factor that's missing is the 
fact that you were talking about before,

1159
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:29,870
like you're not really into fucking 
girls that aren't into you,

1160
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:33,690
you know,
that's completely out of the downside of

1161
00:46:33,691 --> 00:46:34,950
the question.
Yeah.

1162
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:36,330
When you're a skeleton,

1163
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:37,300
you.
Oh yeah,

1164
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:38,130
yeah.
When you're a scale.

1165
00:46:38,131 --> 00:46:38,750
Yeah.
But I mean,

1166
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:40,460
when you're a skeleton,
like what are you going to do

1167
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:45,500
your ball and you just take molly and 
fucking throw down those Viagra is get 

1168
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:46,500
the party started.
Who gives a shit?

1169
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:48,450
Throw that money out.
You can't spend it when you're dead.

1170
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:50,060
Yeah.
What up 70.

1171
00:46:50,061 --> 00:46:51,650
I'm probably going to be less picky,
you know,

1172
00:46:51,651 --> 00:46:52,550
so.
Oh yeah,

1173
00:46:52,551 --> 00:46:53,670
for sure.
But I mean,

1174
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:54,940
like I said,
it's,

1175
00:46:57,220 --> 00:47:00,110
it's you go for a hot 50 year old,
but you know,

1176
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:05,140
who knows,
some of those girls might be into it 

1177
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:05,140
because he's,
you know,

1178
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:05,990
he's iconic and you know,
fuck a celebrity thing.

1179
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:09,420
Celebrity is another crazy thing.
I mean I've,

1180
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,150
I've said it to my buddy,
I'm like,

1181
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:16,190
money maybe brings five or 10 x girls,
like if you use it and I'm going to talk

1182
00:47:16,191 --> 00:47:18,800
about using it in the sense of just 
paying them saying like set up your life

1183
00:47:18,801 --> 00:47:21,140
to where they're given a nice life and 
there's cool shit going on.

1184
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:22,310
Parties,
whatever.

1185
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:26,240
And then the fame I think,
I think it's like a hundred X.

1186
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:29,710
I think it's like a hundred times.
Well you,

1187
00:47:29,711 --> 00:47:30,220
it's very

1188
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:35,220
interesting because you're a guy that's 
just come into this just a few years 

1189
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:35,530
ago,
four years ago,

1190
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:40,800
you know,
so you were already a man in his 

1191
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:40,800
thirties and all this happened and then 
boom,

1192
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,940
you become famous.
So you've got a good perspective on it,

1193
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:48,270
you know,
I think for people looking at it on the 

1194
00:47:48,270 --> 00:47:51,151
outside,
like I don't think any of us could 

1195
00:47:51,151 --> 00:47:51,250
understand what it'd be like to be 
drake.

1196
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:55,180
You know,
I've heard that drake has parties at his

1197
00:47:55,181 --> 00:48:00,181
house.
I know dude who lives near Drake and he 

1198
00:48:00,181 --> 00:48:02,121
complains about the fucking parties and 
the parties are so crazy that the 

1199
00:48:02,121 --> 00:48:04,150
neighbor complaints at drake bought his 
house drinks like,

1200
00:48:04,151 --> 00:48:05,230
fuck it,
I'll just buy your house,

1201
00:48:05,231 --> 00:48:08,110
man.
He has girls.

1202
00:48:08,111 --> 00:48:13,111
They meet at one place,
then they get in a bus and then the bus 

1203
00:48:13,111 --> 00:48:15,530
comes to drake's house.
Now he's,

1204
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:16,630
he's got it.

1205
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,580
Yeah.
He's definitely has it on the level.

1206
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:22,870
Super Baldwin for Super Bowl and you,
you know me,

1207
00:48:22,871 --> 00:48:24,880
I'm fucking saddled down.
I'm married.

1208
00:48:24,881 --> 00:48:26,290
I've got kids.
I've got daughters too.

1209
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:31,320
Dude.
I see all this stuff I have to watch 

1210
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:31,320
from afar and go,
wow,

1211
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:32,980
look at this action with all this 
craziness happening,

1212
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:35,830
look at this.
Wildlife just had a completely different

1213
00:48:35,831 --> 00:48:38,030
kind of life.
But to um,

1214
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:43,440
to be a guy like you,
it's very interesting because not only 

1215
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:43,800
are you're famous,
you're famous in a,

1216
00:48:43,801 --> 00:48:47,830
like a really confusing way.
You're famous just for being a baller,

1217
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:49,870
like 100 percent.
Like it's Kinda crazy.

1218
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:52,540
I didn't write a book.
You're not in any movies,

1219
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,150
you don't sing any songs.
You're not telling jokes.

1220
00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:59,110
You just balling out of control your 
ball and so hard that you become famous.

1221
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:00,880
You way more famous than me.
I mean,

1222
00:49:00,881 --> 00:49:03,490
what did you say you have?
How many instagram followers you got?

1223
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,350
What is it?
Nineteen 18.

1224
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:09,760
I think the total is 31.
One point five on instagram.

1225
00:49:09,761 --> 00:49:13,630
I have a two one on twitter.
I've been on TV for 20 fucking years.

1226
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:19,420
It's funny man.
It's an interesting kind of fame.

1227
00:49:19,421 --> 00:49:20,830
It's a very different kind of fame.

1228
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,190
Yeah,
I mean I just remember,

1229
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:26,910
I remember when it Kinda hit me because 
I was in

1230
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:30,930
can and I

1231
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:32,840
was over there and this,
you know,

1232
00:49:32,841 --> 00:49:37,841
this is,
this is France and then they don't only 

1233
00:49:37,841 --> 00:49:37,841
speak English a lot of these places

1234
00:49:37,841 --> 00:49:37,940
and I mean

1235
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:43,560
I think what was I fuck 16 girls and 
it's 12 days and I remember because I 

1236
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:46,620
fucked a girl without talking to her and
that was when I talked to her.

1237
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:52,110
Yeah,
because she didn't speak English and 

1238
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:52,110
they're.
And I also like,

1239
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:52,480
I just kinda like wanted to like just 
see if I could do it,

1240
00:49:52,481 --> 00:49:57,481
you know,
I just like wanted to see if I could 

1241
00:49:57,481 --> 00:49:57,481
actually have sex with a girl without 
speaking to her at all.

1242
00:49:57,481 --> 00:50:02,160
It was kind of awkward because like 
there's Times that I wanted to say 

1243
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:02,530
something or like there was a question 
asked or whatever,

1244
00:50:02,531 --> 00:50:02,910
like,
you know,

1245
00:50:02,911 --> 00:50:04,700
or it was like in the middle of sex,
like norma,

1246
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,630
like I'll say you have to talk dirty or 
something.

1247
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:09,250
But like I made a point to be a fucking 
mute.

1248
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:14,680
Right.
And I actually like pull it off and I 

1249
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:14,680
was like,
wow,

1250
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:15,070
like this shit is real,
you know,

1251
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:15,800
and,
and,

1252
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:16,840
and,
and,

1253
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:19,560
and the time that I really saw it as a.

1254
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:19,940
sorry,
let me,

1255
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:20,910
it was,
it was,

1256
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:21,860
I mean,
I was in Canada.

1257
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:23,650
Is before the,
the no talking thing.

1258
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:29,490
I was at some restaurant and raw Ron 
Perlman's manager came over to me and 

1259
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,580
he's the actor.
Yeah.

1260
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,120
Sons of anarchy.
Yeah.

1261
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:36,310
Hellboy in hell,
that's a real shit,

1262
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:37,340
you know,
he's a real dude.

1263
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:41,330
So he come over and he's telling me 
about this new movie that he wants to do

1264
00:50:41,331 --> 00:50:42,440
and there's like a,
um,

1265
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:44,870
there's a dad and there's a son or 
grandfather's grandfather,

1266
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:47,810
son and dad and they're all,
they're all in the military in different

1267
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:52,811
wars.
And he was talking to me about maybe 

1268
00:50:52,811 --> 00:50:52,811
playing the son and,
and we're having,

1269
00:50:52,811 --> 00:50:57,770
you know,
and I was interested in it because I'd 

1270
00:50:57,770 --> 00:50:57,770
done a little bit of acting up until 
then.

1271
00:50:57,770 --> 00:50:57,770
And so it was like,
you know,

1272
00:50:57,770 --> 00:50:57,770
kind of,
you know,

1273
00:50:57,770 --> 00:50:58,490
trying to,
you know,

1274
00:50:58,520 --> 00:50:59,000
check it out.

1275
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:04,000
And so I remember it was like every 30 
seconds or minutes somebody would come 

1276
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:09,161
up and ask you for a picture and after 
like the 20th person,

1277
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:12,590
somebody came up and was like,
oh Ron,

1278
00:51:12,591 --> 00:51:13,070
like,
you know,

1279
00:51:13,071 --> 00:51:16,010
I love a picture with you and I'll never
forget it.

1280
00:51:16,011 --> 00:51:17,390
I'll never forget for the rest of my 
life.

1281
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:19,160
He stood up and he goes,
oh,

1282
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:20,330
you want a picture of me?
Like,

1283
00:51:20,331 --> 00:51:25,331
who the fuck am I?
You sure you don't want a picture of 

1284
00:51:25,331 --> 00:51:25,331
this guy?
And he was kidding.

1285
00:51:25,331 --> 00:51:25,340
But I was just like,
I was like,

1286
00:51:25,341 --> 00:51:27,260
wow,
like this is so fucking crazy.

1287
00:51:27,261 --> 00:51:29,120
Now here's a guy that's like,
you know,

1288
00:51:29,121 --> 00:51:31,400
a super successful actor has been like,
you know,

1289
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:35,900
big like tv series and like all these 
people are asking to take a picture with

1290
00:51:35,901 --> 00:51:36,650
me.
And I was just like,

1291
00:51:36,651 --> 00:51:38,970
wow,
like this is so fucked up.

1292
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:40,460
But it was real.
I was just like,

1293
00:51:40,461 --> 00:51:41,660
wow,
this is like a real thing.

1294
00:51:41,661 --> 00:51:43,940
This isn't just like numbers on the 
Internet.

1295
00:51:43,941 --> 00:51:48,941
This is like I'm in a foreign country 
and I got all these fucking people 

1296
00:51:48,941 --> 00:51:48,941
coming up.
I was,

1297
00:51:48,941 --> 00:51:51,080
I was kinda like,
I was dumbfounded.

1298
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:51,910
Have you ever

1299
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:57,000
read that thoreau quote?
Most men live lives of quiet 

1300
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:57,000
desperation.

1301
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,610
Yeah,
actually quoted that in one of my 

1302
00:52:01,610 --> 00:52:01,610
pictures.
Oh,

1303
00:52:01,610 --> 00:52:03,981
that's a great quote.
The massive men or something along the 

1304
00:52:03,981 --> 00:52:05,690
lines of the mass of men lead lives of 
quiet.

1305
00:52:06,310 --> 00:52:08,320
Something along those lines.
That quote,

1306
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:10,480
fucking died.
Love that quote.

1307
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:12,460
That's got a lot of great ones.
He's a brilliant,

1308
00:52:12,490 --> 00:52:17,490
brilliant guy,
but that quote is that one of the 

1309
00:52:17,490 --> 00:52:20,521
reasons why I think your instagram and 
everything is so popular is because 

1310
00:52:20,521 --> 00:52:24,391
there's a lot of people out there that 
are stuck in cubicles or they're stuck 

1311
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:24,640
in jobs that they don't want to be 
there.

1312
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:25,900
They don't want to be doing what they're
doing.

1313
00:52:25,901 --> 00:52:28,060
They're looking at the resources.
They're so small,

1314
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:29,950
they're tired all the time.
They get done from work.

1315
00:52:30,370 --> 00:52:32,560
They don't have any energy to do 
anything else.

1316
00:52:32,561 --> 00:52:37,561
They're saddled down with some 
relationship is probably not optimal to 

1317
00:52:37,561 --> 00:52:39,760
getting yelled at the fucking.
It's not going well.

1318
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:41,380
It's not going well.
There's not a lot of joy.

1319
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:46,620
And then they go on your instagram and 
your fucking jet skiing and lake mead 

1320
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:46,750
and so all the,
you know,

1321
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:49,240
shooting guns and your underwear and 
it's like,

1322
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:51,250
it's.
So it looks so fun,

1323
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:52,230
you know?
And

1324
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:54,280
yeah,
I mean I try and be authentic,

1325
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:55,480
you know,
another one of his quotes,

1326
00:52:55,481 --> 00:52:57,550
you know,
rather than love rather than fame rather

1327
00:52:57,551 --> 00:53:02,551
than money Gimme truth.
And I liked that to have all those 

1328
00:53:02,551 --> 00:53:02,551
though.
Look,

1329
00:53:02,551 --> 00:53:02,551
you got it all.
You got to truth.

1330
00:53:02,551 --> 00:53:03,640
You've got fame.
We got drugs,

1331
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:05,930
heroin and la.

1332
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:11,410
Well it is,
it is rare because it's difficult to 

1333
00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:12,410
pull off because most people are not 
really comfortable with who they are.

1334
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:14,230
So instead of,
you know,

1335
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:18,190
instead of fixing that,
they just kinda pretend you know,

1336
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,070
and like,
look,

1337
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:22,160
that's what politics is.
That's what a business is.

1338
00:53:22,161 --> 00:53:25,800
When you put that fucking stupid tie on 
and he got those slippery shoes with the

1339
00:53:25,801 --> 00:53:29,100
tassels on them and pretending that you 
really talk like that.

1340
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:34,420
You know,
when you're talking about dividends and 

1341
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:36,501
making them know that we can make this 
work and let's touch base on Monday and 

1342
00:53:36,501 --> 00:53:39,951
way.
Great to talk to you and like shut the 

1343
00:53:39,951 --> 00:53:39,951
fuck up

1344
00:53:39,951 --> 00:53:41,740
or correctness,
the fucking pleasant trees that just the

1345
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:43,380
bullshit,
you know,

1346
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:44,950
that's what I wanted to just kind of

1347
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:47,880
get rid of.
I had a conversation with someone about,

1348
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:53,030
you know,
people that have a lot of money and 

1349
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:53,030
ballers and someone goes,
uh Oh,

1350
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:57,381
that seems like such an empty life.
And I don't know if we were talking 

1351
00:53:57,381 --> 00:53:57,450
about you specifically,
but you're like a perfect example of it.

1352
00:53:57,810 --> 00:54:00,240
I'm like,
but here's my point.

1353
00:54:00,241 --> 00:54:01,260
I'm defending you.
I'm like,

1354
00:54:01,261 --> 00:54:03,420
what's empty about?
It looks like he's having fun.

1355
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:08,540
Like,
what's so great about showing up to an 

1356
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:09,150
insurance company every day and putting 
in your work like,

1357
00:54:09,350 --> 00:54:09,810
yeah,
look,

1358
00:54:09,811 --> 00:54:12,240
it's very admirable to provide for your 
family.

1359
00:54:12,241 --> 00:54:17,241
It's very admirable to put in hard work 
when you don't want to and get it done.

1360
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:21,510
But there's nothing wrong with figuring 
out a way to not do that either.

1361
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:26,590
You know?
Just because you got stuck in some sort 

1362
00:54:26,590 --> 00:54:28,260
of a weird situation where you have to 
fucking grind it out at some lumber yard

1363
00:54:28,261 --> 00:54:28,770
every day.

1364
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:34,040
Doesn't mean that a guy like you who's 
just got some crazy life that he's lived

1365
00:54:34,421 --> 00:54:36,240
and where he figured out a way to make a
bunch of money,

1366
00:54:36,241 --> 00:54:39,700
gambling poker,
playing card games like that's not,

1367
00:54:39,770 --> 00:54:42,570
it's not necessarily a bad thing.
Like I look at all your shit.

1368
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,540
I don't see any victims.
I don't see anything wrong.

1369
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:49,740
I see you having a bunch of fun and I 
see a bunch of girls that are laughing.

1370
00:54:49,830 --> 00:54:52,890
They seem to be having a bunch of fun.
You're flying to Italy,

1371
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:58,010
you're doing all this crazy shit.
I don't see anything wrong but yet 

1372
00:54:58,010 --> 00:55:01,671
people get mad and people hate.
And when I have conversations with 

1373
00:55:01,671 --> 00:55:05,271
people and Mike,
what is shallow about all these 

1374
00:55:05,271 --> 00:55:05,271
experiences?
Like what is,

1375
00:55:05,271 --> 00:55:05,670
what is so awful?

1376
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:06,220
Yeah.
I mean,

1377
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,880
and a lot of girls have really 
benefited,

1378
00:55:07,881 --> 00:55:09,230
you know,
build some careers.

1379
00:55:09,231 --> 00:55:09,600
Like,
you know,

1380
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,150
Lindsay polyps.
When I started dating her,

1381
00:55:11,151 --> 00:55:12,680
she had a 100,000
followers.

1382
00:55:12,681 --> 00:55:17,681
She bumped up the one point $6 million 
and three weeks and now this chick's 

1383
00:55:17,681 --> 00:55:19,850
making poor $500,000
a year posting pictures on instagram and

1384
00:55:19,851 --> 00:55:20,390
snapchat.
I mean,

1385
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:25,590
just just think about that for a second,
like she's making four times as much as 

1386
00:55:26,421 --> 00:55:29,760
a doctor or a lawyer when they get out 
of college and,

1387
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:34,840
and,
and forget about all their debt that 

1388
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:34,840
they have,
you know,

1389
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:34,940
let's just say they come out of college 
with no debt.

1390
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:39,410
She's still making five times more money
than them at four years younger.

1391
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:44,940
Well also the amount of fucking time 
they have to spend if you're a doctor or

1392
00:55:45,161 --> 00:55:46,780
a lawyer,
not just going through medical school,

1393
00:55:46,781 --> 00:55:48,670
not just going through your residency 
but working,

1394
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:51,260
constantly working and she's got a post,
a couple pictures.

1395
00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:54,080
Sit on a couch,
post a few pictures.

1396
00:55:54,081 --> 00:55:57,760
She stuck her by t her ass up in the 
air.

1397
00:55:57,820 --> 00:55:59,230
High heels.
Ooh.

1398
00:55:59,550 --> 00:56:04,550
It's beautiful world.
The world of social media is a 

1399
00:56:04,550 --> 00:56:05,340
fascinating world man because like 
speaking for me personally as a,

1400
00:56:05,341 --> 00:56:09,970
as a comedian before social media,
I used to have to do so much work.

1401
00:56:09,971 --> 00:56:13,930
I used to have to get up early in the 
morning and do radio shows before gigs.

1402
00:56:13,931 --> 00:56:17,410
I used to have to do morning TV.
You'd have to do interviews with,

1403
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:22,770
you know,
I do an interview with some newspaper 

1404
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:22,770
reporter if that guy did not want to 
fucking talk to me and give a shit about

1405
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:25,450
me and try to have fun with it and maybe
he would try to have fun with it,

1406
00:56:25,451 --> 00:56:30,451
but for the most part it was nonsense.
You don't have to do any of that 

1407
00:56:30,451 --> 00:56:30,451
anymore.
Social media,

1408
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:34,980
it's just pure uh,
access and it's,

1409
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:40,660
it's actually fucked it up honestly for 
a lot of these girls now because they 

1410
00:56:40,911 --> 00:56:45,911
don't want to go to the clubs.
Like they don't need to go to parties 

1411
00:56:45,911 --> 00:56:46,150
and meet celebrities anymore.
They could just dm him like,

1412
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:49,430
and then you have all these rich guys 
that are just having their,

1413
00:56:49,431 --> 00:56:50,780
you know,
their pussy coordinator,

1414
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,170
you know,
message all these ordinator Oh,

1415
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:55,050
who has a court,
was a pussy coordinator.

1416
00:56:55,070 --> 00:56:56,510
Crazy Bro.
You have no idea.

1417
00:56:56,511 --> 00:56:58,490
Like now these girls are getting booked 
out there,

1418
00:56:58,491 --> 00:57:01,640
getting paid $5,000,
$10,000

1419
00:57:01,641 --> 00:57:06,641
to just go on a vacation.
Some of them don't even have to sleep 

1420
00:57:06,641 --> 00:57:06,641
with any of the guys.
I mean,

1421
00:57:06,641 --> 00:57:06,641
it's just like,

1422
00:57:07,310 --> 00:57:09,740
that seems like you would never get 
anything done.

1423
00:57:10,490 --> 00:57:10,800
Yeah,
I mean,

1424
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:11,260
and,
and,

1425
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:16,261
and from these girls' point of view,
you can't really blame them and it's 

1426
00:57:16,261 --> 00:57:16,261
like,
fuck,

1427
00:57:16,261 --> 00:57:16,910
if I was one of these girls and I could 
travel the world on a private jet and do

1428
00:57:16,911 --> 00:57:20,270
all this other crazy shit for free and 
it's just.

1429
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:21,480
I mean,
I don't

1430
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:26,480
blame them at all as long as long as 
nothing awful is happening.

1431
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:29,070
Yeah.
I used to know this guy,

1432
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:34,940
we call him wild man.
A buddy of mine used to work at a strip 

1433
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:37,701
club.
He was a DJ at a strip club and there 

1434
00:57:37,701 --> 00:57:40,101
was a guy there that apparently invented
bell bottoms is a crazy story and he had

1435
00:57:40,801 --> 00:57:45,801
lung cancer.
He smoked cigarettes like packs and 

1436
00:57:45,801 --> 00:57:46,500
packs a day and no emphysema.
And his doctor was telling him,

1437
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:52,190
listen man,
you are going to fucking die if you 

1438
00:57:52,190 --> 00:57:52,190
don't stop smoking cigarettes.
You're gonna fucking die.

1439
00:57:52,190 --> 00:57:53,280
And he's like,
I'm just addicted to smoking.

1440
00:57:53,281 --> 00:57:54,890
It was like smoke joints.
He's like,

1441
00:57:54,891 --> 00:57:59,891
they're,
they've shown in studies that smoking 

1442
00:57:59,891 --> 00:58:02,121
marijuana is not nearly as bad for you.
And actually it might act as an 

1443
00:58:02,121 --> 00:58:03,570
expectorant it might help clean your 
lungs out even though it sounds contrary

1444
00:58:03,571 --> 00:58:05,190
to,
to logical thinking.

1445
00:58:05,910 --> 00:58:08,010
Just give it a try.
So this guy starts smoking weed,

1446
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:11,640
like he would smoke cigarettes.
You just roll in joint smoking.

1447
00:58:11,910 --> 00:58:14,370
He would smoke like 15,
20 joints a day.

1448
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,140
And he would,
when he pull up to the Strip club,

1449
00:58:16,290 --> 00:58:21,290
he would give these guys like his 
roaches because there's roaches were 

1450
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:21,290
like half done because he would smoke 
them,

1451
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:24,170
smoke cigarettes.
The guy changes his entirely.

1452
00:58:24,171 --> 00:58:26,310
He gets so high and he's so high all the
time.

1453
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:31,520
He's like,
I don't want to do any of these things 

1454
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:31,520
that I'm doing anymore.
He goes,

1455
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:31,800
this is one on one,
do I want to play guitar?

1456
00:58:31,890 --> 00:58:35,340
And I want a bank checks.
And that's when he decides to do.

1457
00:58:35,341 --> 00:58:38,340
He realizes he's like 60 years old and 
he's worth some shit,

1458
00:58:38,341 --> 00:58:43,341
ton of money.
And this was like right around when 

1459
00:58:43,341 --> 00:58:45,171
Viagra was invented.
So this guy goes on a rampage and he's.

1460
00:58:46,470 --> 00:58:48,990
But he's mean,
he's like really nasty.

1461
00:58:48,991 --> 00:58:51,030
And he did what he would call mad dog in
these chicks.

1462
00:58:51,210 --> 00:58:56,210
So He'd bring them back to his house and
he would say nasty shit to him and hit 

1463
00:58:56,210 --> 00:58:57,510
him and piss on him and all kinds of 
crazy shit.

1464
00:58:57,511 --> 00:58:59,760
Apparently,
I don't know the full details of it,

1465
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:05,060
but his house was for sale and he had 
this ball baller house in the Hollywood 

1466
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:07,860
hills and for awhile I was thinking 
because I go to the comedy store all the

1467
00:59:07,861 --> 00:59:08,400
time,
I'm like,

1468
00:59:08,401 --> 00:59:09,900
man,
maybe I should buy this fucking house.

1469
00:59:09,901 --> 00:59:11,490
It's like it's close to the comedy 
store,

1470
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:12,600
but I'm like,
God,

1471
00:59:12,601 --> 00:59:14,160
it's like this $5,000,000
house.

1472
00:59:14,161 --> 00:59:16,020
It's right on the street.
It's right there.

1473
00:59:16,021 --> 00:59:18,990
Like you could use the sidewalk and then
here's his door.

1474
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:24,020
Like you just touch his door and like 
someone's gonna fucking break into this 

1475
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:24,020
guy's house.

1476
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:24,320
And so the realtor is like,
no,

1477
00:59:24,321 --> 00:59:29,321
listen,
there's a state of the art security 

1478
00:59:29,321 --> 00:59:29,321
system in this place.
It's got all these cameras.

1479
00:59:29,321 --> 00:59:29,321
I go,
yeah,

1480
00:59:29,321 --> 00:59:30,020
you know what that camera's going to 
get.

1481
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:35,230
It's going to get a picture of a dude 
with a ski mask robbing your fucking 

1482
00:59:35,230 --> 00:59:35,230
house.
Like,

1483
00:59:35,230 --> 00:59:36,080
do you understand that?
Like what is,

1484
00:59:36,110 --> 00:59:37,800
what is a camera going to do?
Like how's it going?

1485
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:41,510
Two weeks after I said that the dude got
shot in the neck,

1486
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:46,720
in the fucking house he brought.
He used to bring the hookers to his 

1487
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:50,471
house.
He used to bring them to his house and 

1488
00:59:50,471 --> 00:59:52,691
he brought one to his house and she 
brought her boyfriend and they shot him 

1489
00:59:52,691 --> 00:59:52,691
in the neck.
Wow.

1490
00:59:52,691 --> 00:59:52,691
Yeah.
There's a lot of setup,

1491
00:59:52,691 --> 00:59:53,320
stuff like that.
Yeah.

1492
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:54,110
Yeah.
But.

1493
00:59:54,111 --> 00:59:58,160
So they see that's a bad guy.
That was a guy doing bad shit.

1494
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:00,440
I don't see anything wrong with anything
you're doing.

1495
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,300
I see.
I see happiness.

1496
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:05,030
I look at your instagram.
I see a bunch of people laughing.

1497
01:00:05,270 --> 01:00:07,870
I liked the music you're playing.
You're playing

1498
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:11,210
songs that I would listen to.
It looks like a fucking party.

1499
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:15,200
Nothing wrong here.
People need to relax.

1500
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:18,290
Yeah,
I mean I'm just know doing some wish.

1501
01:00:18,291 --> 01:00:19,850
Fulfillment.
Now,

1502
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,680
do you have like,
do you have a like a plan,

1503
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:28,430
chart it out for this existence?
Are you just winging it?

1504
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:31,580
Well,
I got this APP coming out,

1505
01:00:31,710 --> 01:00:36,710
um,
where it's going to be kind of similar 

1506
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:36,710
to like what World Star does,
where you can,

1507
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:37,400
users can upload,
you know,

1508
01:00:37,410 --> 01:00:39,440
they're bad ass videos,
right.

1509
01:00:39,441 --> 01:00:42,550
So anything kind of like,
you know,

1510
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,600
similar to the stuff that I post or you 
know,

1511
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:49,630
fights or whatever crazy cool videos 
that they want they can post on there 

1512
01:00:49,630 --> 01:00:54,250
and you know,
I'll just share the best ones on my 

1513
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:54,250
facebook or instagram or whatever.
So they're,

1514
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:55,850
you know,
if they post cool shit on there,

1515
01:00:55,851 --> 01:00:57,370
they're guaranteed to get,
you know,

1516
01:00:57,410 --> 01:00:58,250
a view on a shine.

1517
01:00:58,250 --> 01:01:00,200
Yeah.
And that's why they post on Worldstar,

1518
01:01:00,201 --> 01:01:02,180
you know,
because they want people to see it.

1519
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:05,110
So I'm,
I'm,

1520
01:01:05,150 --> 01:01:06,500
you know,
I'm going to do that.

1521
01:01:06,501 --> 01:01:09,840
I got this,
a fantasy betting app that I got a,

1522
01:01:09,841 --> 01:01:10,690
it's a,
you know,

1523
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:14,330
it's like similar to the draft kings of 
the fantasy sports stuff.

1524
01:01:14,830 --> 01:01:17,240
Um,
I know just,

1525
01:01:17,241 --> 01:01:22,241
you know,
I've been focusing more on doing some 

1526
01:01:22,241 --> 01:01:22,241
stuff like that.
I've Kinda just done everything I wanted

1527
01:01:22,241 --> 01:01:22,860
to do,
you know,

1528
01:01:22,890 --> 01:01:27,260
and you know,
as far as like the partying and shit,

1529
01:01:27,261 --> 01:01:28,430
you know,
so.

1530
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:31,340
Well that's why I was asking him like,
well how much more can you do,

1531
01:01:32,090 --> 01:01:32,770
you know?
Yeah.

1532
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:35,120
I mean I've checked most of the boxes 
man.

1533
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:40,150
So now I kinda just want to give people 
a platform to how much money have you 

1534
01:01:40,150 --> 01:01:43,850
made playing poker?
I don't know.

1535
01:01:44,190 --> 01:01:46,880
I mean if you had to guess in the 
neighborhood.

1536
01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:49,940
I mean,
I know,

1537
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:51,570
I mean I,
you know,

1538
01:01:51,730 --> 01:01:53,280
I just know the big figures,
right?

1539
01:01:53,590 --> 01:01:55,450
You know,
it'd be one guy for $54 million.

1540
01:01:55,460 --> 01:02:00,460
I mean I won 10 and a half and another 
night I've been another guy for 10 and 

1541
01:02:00,921 --> 01:02:05,921
then you know,
I don't know what the total is on the 

1542
01:02:05,921 --> 01:02:06,600
other cash games but you know,
I dunno,

1543
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:07,550
I know made a lot.

1544
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:09,090
But do you have enough stashed away?

1545
01:02:09,270 --> 01:02:10,120
That was,
that was just an,

1546
01:02:10,150 --> 01:02:12,190
you know,
a six month or a year period.

1547
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:13,420
So it's like a,
you know,

1548
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:13,970
I don't know.

1549
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:16,850
Did you take a chunk and put it away and
say,

1550
01:02:16,851 --> 01:02:21,851
okay,
this is my break glass in case of 

1551
01:02:21,851 --> 01:02:21,851
apocalypse fund.

1552
01:02:21,851 --> 01:02:21,851
Okay.

1553
01:02:21,851 --> 01:02:22,830
Oh good.
I've bought bathrooms goal then,

1554
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:23,600
you know,
and I,

1555
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:27,660
and I own my stuff,
my plan and my house and my car.

1556
01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:32,390
Then I cash in the bank.
I'm doing all.

1557
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:34,730
Yeah,
but I mean this,

1558
01:02:34,790 --> 01:02:37,140
like this.
First of all,

1559
01:02:37,141 --> 01:02:37,980
that's crazy,
right?

1560
01:02:37,981 --> 01:02:42,981
It's crazy that you went from being a 
navy seal to being a college student 

1561
01:02:42,981 --> 01:02:44,060
who's learning to play cards,
you know,

1562
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:47,160
preparing or trying to attempt to be a 
navy seal,

1563
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:50,370
going to college and learn how to play 
cards to a guy who's got his own fucking

1564
01:02:50,371 --> 01:02:53,700
jet.
Got It all from gambling.

1565
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:54,210
I mean,
that's,

1566
01:02:54,330 --> 01:02:56,070
that's,
that's bizarre in and of itself.

1567
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:01,400
But do you ever think like there's a 
time where I'm not going to want to do 

1568
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:01,950
this anymore?

1569
01:03:02,690 --> 01:03:03,230
Yeah,
I mean,

1570
01:03:03,231 --> 01:03:03,740
I'm,
you know,

1571
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:05,120
I'm kind of at the point,
like I said,

1572
01:03:05,121 --> 01:03:07,550
where I've done most of the stuff that I
wanted to do.

1573
01:03:07,890 --> 01:03:10,910
Um,
so now I'm just,

1574
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:13,250
I'm kind of winging it.
I've been doing more active stuff.

1575
01:03:13,251 --> 01:03:14,170
I've been doing,
uh,

1576
01:03:14,210 --> 01:03:18,660
like some wake surfing and we went out 
to Lake Powell and um,

1577
01:03:18,930 --> 01:03:23,930
you know,
winter's coming up and doing some 

1578
01:03:23,930 --> 01:03:23,930
snowboarding trips.
Snowmobile and just more fun.

1579
01:03:23,930 --> 01:03:28,870
Yeah,
just haven't bombed but doing like more 

1580
01:03:28,870 --> 01:03:28,870
active stuff.
Less party and mean self,

1581
01:03:28,870 --> 01:03:30,830
the girls around.
But um,

1582
01:03:31,130 --> 01:03:32,030
yeah,
I mean I got,

1583
01:03:32,130 --> 01:03:34,030
I did a cartoon.
It's a,

1584
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:34,430
I'm about to,

1585
01:03:35,330 --> 01:03:38,060
didn't you have two heart attacks and 
like one night or something.

1586
01:03:38,090 --> 01:03:42,030
That's actually one of the cartoon 
episodes happen.

1587
01:03:42,170 --> 01:03:44,270
How did you have to.
Hard to get out the car theater.

1588
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:46,590
Do you have the cartoon?
Watch it,

1589
01:03:46,870 --> 01:03:50,880
throw the Cartena how do we,
how do we get to it until Jamie gets A.

1590
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:51,940
Yeah,
I'm sure you could drop a day,

1591
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:53,840
Jamie,
or do you have it on your phone?

1592
01:03:53,841 --> 01:03:56,030
Is that what it is?
It's on my phone.

1593
01:03:56,270 --> 01:03:57,140
Oh,
can you,

1594
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,370
can you airdrop it to you?
Jamie?

1595
01:03:58,371 --> 01:03:59,150
Does that work?
Uh,

1596
01:03:59,190 --> 01:04:04,190
I can't airdrop it,
but I can airplay it if you've got an 

1597
01:04:04,190 --> 01:04:04,880
apple TV.
We have an apple tv but we can't play it

1598
01:04:04,881 --> 01:04:08,370
online vs watching it in here.
We can hear it or anything.

1599
01:04:08,910 --> 01:04:10,850
I can't put it on that.
You can,

1600
01:04:10,851 --> 01:04:13,520
but I don't have that.
That's not the system here.

1601
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:16,170
It's not built into this display.
Um,

1602
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:18,230
let me see.
Can we fix that?

1603
01:04:18,290 --> 01:04:20,370
Can we make that happen or is that we 
can in the future,

1604
01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:22,910
but we need a different setup or 
something.

1605
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:24,740
I need some extra inputs.
Yeah,

1606
01:04:26,860 --> 01:04:31,860
we'll do it another time.
I'm going to call my guy and see if I 

1607
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:32,310
can get you a link you want to give me.
Give me one second.

1608
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:32,670
Yeah,
yeah.

1609
01:04:32,671 --> 01:04:35,420
Good.
Call Your Guy Dan Bilzerian,

1610
01:04:35,421 --> 01:04:36,950
but we'll be right back.
Ladies and gentlemen,

1611
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:38,240
he's gonna.
Call his guy.

1612
01:04:38,570 --> 01:04:40,430
Not to be confused with this pussy 
coordinator.

1613
01:04:41,030 --> 01:04:44,780
He doesn't have one of those.
Are you looking for pussy coordinator?

1614
01:04:45,110 --> 01:04:50,110
I know some dudes look crazy.
Life Bizarre,

1615
01:04:50,691 --> 01:04:52,340
right?
I just,

1616
01:04:53,780 --> 01:04:54,720
you know,
people,

1617
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:58,400
people will tell you that's going to get
tired.

1618
01:04:58,670 --> 01:05:03,670
We guess what?
So it was being married to a lot of 

1619
01:05:03,670 --> 01:05:03,980
people,
not to me.

1620
01:05:03,981 --> 01:05:08,981
Jamie.
So is working in a regular job that's 

1621
01:05:08,981 --> 01:05:09,110
got to be tired too.

1622
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:14,380
I love the fact that this is a real 
thing that all of a sudden because of 

1623
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:19,001
social media,
some guy can gather up 50 million 

1624
01:05:19,001 --> 01:05:19,020
followers,
be continent,

1625
01:05:19,030 --> 01:05:20,740
I don't know how to word this right?
But like,

1626
01:05:20,741 --> 01:05:23,050
you know,
people start calling the Michael Jordan.

1627
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:28,200
You'd be the Michael Jordan of this 
because you're the greatest of whatever 

1628
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:31,800
he's starting to become.
People are calling so and so the Dan 

1629
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:31,900
Bilzerian of,
of X.

1630
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:36,900
Oh yeah,
well that becomes so intense that 

1631
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:37,540
Italian guy,
juvenile vaccine,

1632
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:37,890
the,
Oh,

1633
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:40,680
that old guy is my age.
Isn't that sad?

1634
01:05:40,730 --> 01:05:41,620
God Damn,
I'm old.

1635
01:05:41,660 --> 01:05:46,660
Pro Sad.
Every now and then I wake up and I got 

1636
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:50,190
some new pain and uh,
I just think it's this pain like forever

1637
01:05:50,670 --> 01:05:54,300
is this going to heal here,
this hip thing that's going on lately?

1638
01:05:55,410 --> 01:06:00,410
And it's not bad.
Like I did kickboxing today and no 

1639
01:06:00,410 --> 01:06:00,750
problem,
no pain while I'm working out,

1640
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:04,050
but every now and then it irritates me 
and instead of it,

1641
01:06:04,110 --> 01:06:06,720
like when I was young,
if I had something that irritated me,

1642
01:06:06,721 --> 01:06:07,600
I would say,
Eh,

1643
01:06:07,770 --> 01:06:08,850
some fucking nothing.

1644
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:13,880
I'll get over that.
But that's also why I developed a bunch 

1645
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:16,431
of chronic injuries from Jujitsu because
I would go and train even though it had 

1646
01:06:16,431 --> 01:06:18,300
something fucked up.
It's also because Jujitsu is really fun,

1647
01:06:18,390 --> 01:06:20,200
but I don't think like that anymore.
Man.

1648
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:23,370
Now I think,
is this like broken?

1649
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:26,250
Like is this,
am I going to need a hip replacement?

1650
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:28,800
Like I know guys that are my age that if
a fucking.

1651
01:06:28,830 --> 01:06:32,310
I know guys younger than me that have 
had hip replacements.

1652
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:34,710
I started thinking like,
is this shit broken forever?

1653
01:06:35,550 --> 01:06:38,250
You got your guy.
I talked to him.

1654
01:06:38,251 --> 01:06:40,140
He's telling me I can't.
I can't show it.

1655
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:42,700
You can't always tell who the fuck is 
that guy.

1656
01:06:42,701 --> 01:06:44,490
So you've got a guide that tells you 
what to do.

1657
01:06:44,970 --> 01:06:46,980
Saying,
dude,

1658
01:06:46,981 --> 01:06:48,870
I'm available.
I worked for free.

1659
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:53,970
Pretty much fire them all.
I have a team to.

1660
01:06:53,971 --> 01:06:54,900
I don't listen to them either.

1661
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:00,300
Nobody should listen to teams.
I mean,

1662
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:05,320
I obviously don't know shit about poker.
I don't know nothing about your 

1663
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:05,320
business.
I'm not a Gambler,

1664
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:07,830
but I can advise you.
Fire the whole to fire everybody.

1665
01:07:07,831 --> 01:07:10,170
Keep doing exactly what you're doing.
Listen to me,

1666
01:07:10,171 --> 01:07:11,310
dude.
I'm telling them right.

1667
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:14,640
I have no experience in your business.
I'm totally unqualified,

1668
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,640
but I will give you a,
some sound advice.

1669
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:19,790
Yeah.
Um,

1670
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:25,040
you know,
that Italian guy that people keep 

1671
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:25,040
comparing to you,
the guy who dances around a lot.

1672
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:25,040
Oh,
seeing them.

1673
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:26,460
Yeah.
Some health issue.

1674
01:07:26,461 --> 01:07:27,810
What's going on?
Really?

1675
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:33,560
I thought so,
but I don't know if that was the last I 

1676
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:33,560
had heard.
Oh,

1677
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:33,560
I didn't hear that.
What's his name?

1678
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:38,520
Giovanni vaccine or something like that.
Why I became aware of him because it was

1679
01:07:38,521 --> 01:07:40,800
a hilarious video of him and his 
girlfriend dancing.

1680
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:41,470
Oh yeah.
That's great.

1681
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:43,290
Really good.
Fucking great.

1682
01:07:44,490 --> 01:07:45,930
But this thing,
here's the thing man.

1683
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:50,960
Everybody's like,
I saw this thing like something about 

1684
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:52,230
sugar daddy and she's young and hot and 
he's got gray hair that motherfuckers my

1685
01:07:52,231 --> 01:07:54,060
age,
like that's how old I am doing.

1686
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:56,310
Forty nine.
The end is near.

1687
01:07:57,060 --> 01:08:01,140
The end is near Jamie.
There is no,

1688
01:08:01,170 --> 01:08:02,880
it looks great.
Yeah.

1689
01:08:02,881 --> 01:08:07,881
Well it's just the air.
I mean if he had black hair he would 

1690
01:08:07,881 --> 01:08:07,890
look a little bit younger.
Right?

1691
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:08,880
Oh,
for sure.

1692
01:08:08,881 --> 01:08:11,580
I mean he just has premium.
I have a buddy monitor thirties.

1693
01:08:11,610 --> 01:08:14,000
Here's almost all white.
I mean it's just some.

1694
01:08:14,030 --> 01:08:17,450
Some dudes are premature hair and he's 
got a and girlfriend.

1695
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:20,450
He's got one C,
you can't call them the Dan Bilzerian of

1696
01:08:20,451 --> 01:08:22,850
Italy.
I mean he's obviously a baller.

1697
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:24,500
He's living guide.
I was bawling.

1698
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:26,720
Just got one girl.
Yeah,

1699
01:08:26,990 --> 01:08:28,910
I mean I'm sure he's happy.
He looks very happy.

1700
01:08:28,911 --> 01:08:30,890
She looks very happy.
Everybody looks happy.

1701
01:08:31,010 --> 01:08:33,230
I be like,
he's doing a lot of stuff or instagram,

1702
01:08:33,231 --> 01:08:35,810
like he's posted a lot.
Just trying to get on that.

1703
01:08:35,811 --> 01:08:40,430
Dan Bilzerian level picky.
He at with levels yet $5 million.

1704
01:08:40,431 --> 01:08:43,570
How many giant jump.
He's done

1705
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:48,780
twice as many posts as I've done in the 
last five years and he's done it and I 

1706
01:08:48,780 --> 01:08:49,090
think like six bucks.

1707
01:08:49,260 --> 01:08:50,190
Yeah,
very quickly.

1708
01:08:50,310 --> 01:08:53,010
Say he's posting a lot.
Well not only that,

1709
01:08:53,011 --> 01:08:57,300
his shit became a really popular like 
really recently,

1710
01:08:57,410 --> 01:08:59,670
like I want to say when I became aware 
of them,

1711
01:08:59,671 --> 01:09:04,671
we only have 2 million followers,
but like if you look at his stuff 

1712
01:09:04,671 --> 01:09:04,671
though,
it Kinda looks like,

1713
01:09:04,671 --> 01:09:05,280
you know,
like a lot of photo shoots.

1714
01:09:05,290 --> 01:09:07,080
Right,
exactly.

1715
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:10,200
How it looks like a lot of stage.
Oh look,

1716
01:09:10,201 --> 01:09:12,450
I found a goat.
Yeah,

1717
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:14,010
look,
it's me with the goat.

1718
01:09:14,070 --> 01:09:14,820
Yeah.
Yeah.

1719
01:09:14,821 --> 01:09:16,200
He's,
he's got a lot of money.

1720
01:09:16,290 --> 01:09:17,070
Look at that.
Come on.

1721
01:09:17,071 --> 01:09:18,720
So that doesn't just accidentally 
happened,

1722
01:09:18,721 --> 01:09:19,230
right?
Yeah.

1723
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:24,231
You don't just accidentally get 
photographed on a horse with no shirt 

1724
01:09:24,231 --> 01:09:24,510
on.
White with prison tattoos.

1725
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:29,540
What's what?
All the prison tattoos got like a bunch 

1726
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:29,540
of writing on his chest.
Was that all say?

1727
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:33,950
Do we notice tattoos?
Say there must be like a website 

1728
01:09:33,950 --> 01:09:33,950
dedicated to his chest.

1729
01:09:33,950 --> 01:09:33,950
Tattoos.
Look,

1730
01:09:33,950 --> 01:09:34,590
he's there with pit bull.
Look,

1731
01:09:34,740 --> 01:09:37,430
there he is.
Come on.

1732
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:39,880
He's so happy now.
I mean it looks great.

1733
01:09:39,881 --> 01:09:41,820
It looks like a cool cat.
He does what?

1734
01:09:41,821 --> 01:09:46,821
He's doing his beard though.
That little thing that he puts at the 

1735
01:09:46,821 --> 01:09:49,671
bottom of his beard.
He twists it up and puts like a little 

1736
01:09:49,671 --> 01:09:49,671
rubber band around it.
Get the fuck Outta here.

1737
01:09:49,671 --> 01:09:49,760
Fuck.
That is.

1738
01:09:49,830 --> 01:09:52,500
I will pull that thing off.
I see you sir.

1739
01:09:52,501 --> 01:09:55,000
I'm going to grab that thing.
That's Goddamn handle.

1740
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:56,670
I don't understand that.
Yeah,

1741
01:09:57,060 --> 01:09:58,950
he's A.
He's a fun cat though.

1742
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:00,360
His videos are really fun.

1743
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,670
No,
the fucking guy can dance.

1744
01:10:03,820 --> 01:10:05,160
Oh Man.
Did she pulled it?

1745
01:10:05,290 --> 01:10:07,960
See if you can find that one video of 
him with the girl.

1746
01:10:07,961 --> 01:10:10,900
The first one they did on the boat that 
got them really famous.

1747
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:15,790
I want to say that was only four or five
months ago and I've really

1748
01:10:17,670 --> 01:10:20,110
in the last like five months he's really
like,

1749
01:10:20,111 --> 01:10:22,990
he's gone hard like.
But there's some stuff.

1750
01:10:22,991 --> 01:10:25,390
I mean it's like he set up a dinner 
table.

1751
01:10:25,391 --> 01:10:30,391
I saw a picture.
He set up a dinner table underwater 

1752
01:10:30,391 --> 01:10:33,541
where he could like pretend like he was 
eating under water and then he did like 

1753
01:10:33,541 --> 01:10:33,541
a whole,
like a whole skit where he was like,

1754
01:10:33,550 --> 01:10:35,050
underwater doing all this.
I'm like,

1755
01:10:35,051 --> 01:10:40,051
fuck man,
that must have taken you like fucking 

1756
01:10:40,051 --> 01:10:40,051
full day.
Like he's wearing a suit.

1757
01:10:42,210 --> 01:10:43,610
Well,
he's gone a different approach.

1758
01:10:43,630 --> 01:10:46,250
Yeah.
Instead of the baller approach,

1759
01:10:46,251 --> 01:10:51,251
like shooting guns in his underwear,
what he's doing is he's got like this 

1760
01:10:51,251 --> 01:10:55,451
one beautiful girlfriend.
They just have a good time all over the 

1761
01:10:55,451 --> 01:10:55,451
world.
It seems.

1762
01:10:55,451 --> 01:10:55,451
I'm an,
it's a,

1763
01:10:55,451 --> 01:10:55,700
it's a different approach.
But

1764
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,210
here's the by like that.
I did that.

1765
01:10:58,540 --> 01:10:59,590
Like this.
That's it.

1766
01:10:59,620 --> 01:11:00,430
No,
that's awesome.

1767
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:03,200
I mean this mother fucker can dance.
He can.

1768
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:08,240
He can fuck.
And he looks like he's having a good 

1769
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:08,240
time.
Not One hundred percent

1770
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:08,940
that,
that,

1771
01:11:08,970 --> 01:11:09,660
that,
that,

1772
01:11:09,661 --> 01:11:10,440
that.
That's cool.

1773
01:11:10,441 --> 01:11:15,441
To me.
They're like the other stuff that's 

1774
01:11:15,441 --> 01:11:15,441
like,
it seems like lot of effort put into

1775
01:11:15,441 --> 01:11:15,441
it is not,
not quite,

1776
01:11:15,441 --> 01:11:16,320
but that.
That's dope.

1777
01:11:16,321 --> 01:11:19,440
I mean chick seems cool,
bumbling and dance.

1778
01:11:19,441 --> 01:11:20,740
Looks like he's having fun.
I mean like,

1779
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:22,290
listen,
if you got that kind of money,

1780
01:11:22,291 --> 01:11:24,570
why wouldn't you be dancing?
She'd be dancing.

1781
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:26,670
Has Awesome.
Should be partying.

1782
01:11:26,671 --> 01:11:28,080
You're fucking.
And he is just.

1783
01:11:28,110 --> 01:11:30,450
I don't understand his tattoos.
I'm confused about the ankle one.

1784
01:11:31,110 --> 01:11:33,390
What's going on down there?
Maybe it like his ex wife's name.

1785
01:11:33,391 --> 01:11:36,630
Like fuck you.
Bitch isn't good shape though.

1786
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:37,470
Yeah,
he is.

1787
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:38,430
Fuck you.
Yeah,

1788
01:11:38,550 --> 01:11:41,010
he's in very good shape for 49 year old.
That's my age.

1789
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:43,980
Goddammit.
I'm fucking 49,

1790
01:11:43,981 --> 01:11:45,750
man.
It's just the end is near.

1791
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:48,540
Know you're in the right time timeframe.
I'll tell you what it is.

1792
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:51,880
They got the stem cells.
They got the hang of it all of,

1793
01:11:51,881 --> 01:11:53,790
all the above.
Oh yeah man.

1794
01:11:53,791 --> 01:11:55,770
Stem cells fix my fucking shoulder.

1795
01:11:55,790 --> 01:11:57,300
Like people are tired of hearing about 
it.

1796
01:11:57,301 --> 01:11:59,750
On this podcast,
was that Regena kind or was that.

1797
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:02,790
I had regeneca and on my shoulder to 
help as much.

1798
01:12:03,330 --> 01:12:07,140
I had some pretty significant tearing.
I'm a slap tear.

1799
01:12:07,141 --> 01:12:09,290
I had a tear of the,
um,

1800
01:12:09,380 --> 01:12:14,380
the labor room,
a tear of the biceps tendon and a tear 

1801
01:12:14,380 --> 01:12:14,780
of the rotator cuff.
I did the rotator cup.

1802
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:19,820
I basically,
I couldn't even lift my arm like three 

1803
01:12:19,820 --> 01:12:23,061
inches.
I did the REGENECA and then three weeks 

1804
01:12:23,061 --> 01:12:23,061
later I was boxing like,
well Regina,

1805
01:12:23,061 --> 01:12:26,430
Regina kind did wonders for my back.
It just wasn't enough for my shoulder.

1806
01:12:26,610 --> 01:12:27,480
Again.
I'm an idiot.

1807
01:12:27,481 --> 01:12:29,460
I don't give it enough time off.
But uh,

1808
01:12:29,461 --> 01:12:30,350
when I was,
I,

1809
01:12:30,351 --> 01:12:35,351
I mean I literally from like this,
three weeks later I was boxing like,

1810
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:37,450
yeah,
it is amazing.

1811
01:12:37,530 --> 01:12:38,230
Aggressive,
right?

1812
01:12:38,231 --> 01:12:43,231
I mean,
by all the doctors told me I needed 

1813
01:12:43,231 --> 01:12:43,231
surgery.

1814
01:12:43,231 --> 01:12:44,430
Same thing to me.
Not that I've had that said to me twice.

1815
01:12:44,580 --> 01:12:48,150
I need surgery on my neck and I've heard
I need surgery on my shoulder.

1816
01:12:48,151 --> 01:12:50,190
I avoided both of them and I do 
everything now,

1817
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:55,520
but one of the things about shoulder 
injuries that I've found from Steve 

1818
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:55,520
Maxwell,
he's a pretty famous,

1819
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:57,510
a strength and conditioning coach has 
been on this podcast a bunch of times,

1820
01:12:57,990 --> 01:13:01,600
is a hanging hanging from Chin up bars.
It's,

1821
01:13:01,660 --> 01:13:06,660
it's so important to do.
It's so good for your shoulders to 

1822
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:08,220
straighten out your shoulders.
You're going to say bad.

1823
01:13:08,221 --> 01:13:09,170
I was like,
fuck done.

1824
01:13:09,210 --> 01:13:11,430
A lot of that,
so it's really good for you.

1825
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:16,640
There's a whole video about it with his 
doctor who was a shoulder surgery 

1826
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:20,250
doctor,
stopped doing shoulder surgery on most 

1827
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:20,250
of his patients and started them on 
this.

1828
01:13:20,370 --> 01:13:25,370
This hanging therapy,
because when you see most human human 

1829
01:13:26,071 --> 01:13:31,071
beings,
essentially we're primates and most 

1830
01:13:31,071 --> 01:13:31,071
primates swing from trees.

1831
01:13:31,071 --> 01:13:34,760
I mean that is what they do.
They grab a hold of things and they 

1832
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:37,491
swing and it stretches out your arm and 
you develop impingements from gravity 

1833
01:13:38,341 --> 01:13:41,460
from a lack of use or from too much use 
or overuse,

1834
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:45,690
and this guy has you hang from a chin up
bar,

1835
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:50,840
just just holding on and hanging and it 
stretches out your shoulder and it 

1836
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:54,690
alleviates pain in a giant percentage of
people that have shoulder injuries and I

1837
01:13:54,691 --> 01:13:59,691
urge anybody who's listening to this 
that has any sort of shoulder weirdness 

1838
01:13:59,691 --> 01:14:00,870
or some shit that fucks with them to 
just try this.

1839
01:14:00,871 --> 01:14:05,871
I know it sounds crazy like how the fuck
is hanging by your shoulders going to 

1840
01:14:05,871 --> 01:14:09,000
help you and this is one doctor that.
This is not the doctor that invented the

1841
01:14:09,001 --> 01:14:14,001
procedure,
but he basically explains it really 

1842
01:14:14,001 --> 01:14:14,001
well.
There's a bunch of them.

1843
01:14:14,001 --> 01:14:17,670
What did you google so people can 
shoulder pain hanging from a bar and 

1844
01:14:17,670 --> 01:14:19,490
there's a lot of things that start 
popping up as there's a gang of it,

1845
01:14:19,510 --> 01:14:20,950
but it's super effective.

1846
01:14:21,010 --> 01:14:23,020
It's super effective for a lot of 
people.

1847
01:14:23,021 --> 01:14:28,021
I mean if you have significant tearing 
where you're going to need surgery of a 

1848
01:14:28,021 --> 01:14:29,130
failure of your joint or something like 
that,

1849
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:30,040
you know,
that's one thing.

1850
01:14:30,041 --> 01:14:35,041
But for a lot of people this offers them
a great deal of relief and it really 

1851
01:14:35,041 --> 01:14:36,070
helps me.
I do it every day.

1852
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:38,050
It's one of the first things I do in the
morning.

1853
01:14:38,051 --> 01:14:42,160
I hang and then I do a scapular raises 
for archery.

1854
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:47,460
So I hang.
I'll do like two minutes of hanging and 

1855
01:14:47,460 --> 01:14:47,500
then once I've done two minutes,
then I just,

1856
01:14:47,590 --> 01:14:51,100
I contract my scapula and I hold that in
place for as long as I can.

1857
01:14:51,250 --> 01:14:55,630
So it's like my hands are given out,
my forms are given out and then I forced

1858
01:14:55,631 --> 01:15:00,250
my scapula to carry all the weight.
And you make it a daily routine.

1859
01:15:00,251 --> 01:15:01,780
Just make it is what I do.
I brush my teeth,

1860
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:03,220
I do that.
I just have to do it.

1861
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:05,740
So I'm forcing myself.
I have zero pain,

1862
01:15:05,770 --> 01:15:08,130
zero pain in my shoulders.
But the stem cells was a

1863
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:13,340
factor.
So now are you getting the infusion or 

1864
01:15:13,340 --> 01:15:13,340
are you getting the like how,
how,

1865
01:15:13,340 --> 01:15:14,250
how are you getting it?
Like I said earlier?

1866
01:15:14,330 --> 01:15:14,610
Yeah.

1867
01:15:14,870 --> 01:15:16,460
Um,
well they,

1868
01:15:16,970 --> 01:15:18,950
what they do is they take it from a 
woman,

1869
01:15:18,980 --> 01:15:23,980
a young woman who's had a Sicilian 
section when they give birth through 

1870
01:15:23,980 --> 01:15:25,400
Assyrian section,
they take the placenta and then they use

1871
01:15:25,401 --> 01:15:30,401
that for stem cells and that apparently 
is the most powerful version of stem 

1872
01:15:30,401 --> 01:15:35,261
cell therapy.
There's a bunch of different kinds of 

1873
01:15:35,261 --> 01:15:35,261
they use in this country that a lot of 
people,

1874
01:15:35,261 --> 01:15:35,840
like a lot of people like it.
When they take your fat out,

1875
01:15:35,870 --> 01:15:38,710
they take your fat out and they convert 
that stem cells and I brought into that.

1876
01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:41,210
But Daniel Cormier,
they went into his hip.

1877
01:15:41,430 --> 01:15:42,770
They got his marrow.

1878
01:15:42,820 --> 01:15:43,370
Yeah.
I got,

1879
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:46,180
I got a 19 year old bone marrow

1880
01:15:46,580 --> 01:15:48,300
from someone else.
Okay.

1881
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:51,680
Daniel Cormier,
they went into his own hip and pulled it

1882
01:15:51,681 --> 01:15:56,681
out.
But I've heard great results from a lot 

1883
01:15:56,681 --> 01:15:57,680
of different versions of stem cells.
But I know for me personally,

1884
01:15:58,070 --> 01:16:01,610
when they shot the stuff from placenta 
and in my shoulder,

1885
01:16:01,910 --> 01:16:05,240
it was like within a couple of weeks it 
was better than it had been in a year.

1886
01:16:05,540 --> 01:16:08,930
And then a few months after that I was 
like,

1887
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:11,690
no pain.
It's amazing how quick it's healed.

1888
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:16,430
And also did a lot of shoulder exercises
with rubber bands and stuff.

1889
01:16:16,730 --> 01:16:18,530
A lot of different things that I 
concentrate on.

1890
01:16:18,531 --> 01:16:21,590
I do all the time now to strengthen up 
the area and keep it tight.

1891
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:23,900
But you haven't done the,
uh,

1892
01:16:23,901 --> 01:16:25,550
the Ivs.
So you did that?

1893
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:26,840
Huh?
I've done that twice.

1894
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:29,120
Last route and did that.
He told me that it was like he goes,

1895
01:16:29,121 --> 01:16:31,220
it was like the power was coming out of 
my hands.

1896
01:16:32,670 --> 01:16:34,890
It's pretty crazy.
I mean,

1897
01:16:34,891 --> 01:16:37,200
I basically,
it was weird though,

1898
01:16:37,201 --> 01:16:40,470
the first time I did it,
it seemed like I had a lot more profound

1899
01:16:40,471 --> 01:16:45,471
effect on the second but the first time.
So I went down to Mexico because you 

1900
01:16:46,231 --> 01:16:51,231
can't do it in the US.
So I went down there and got like $90 

1901
01:16:51,231 --> 01:16:51,231
million,
uh,

1902
01:16:51,231 --> 01:16:54,450
of the 19 year old bone marrow oxygen 
deprived or whatever,

1903
01:16:54,470 --> 01:16:57,530
and they injected in you.
Um,

1904
01:16:57,660 --> 01:17:02,660
the next day I went to get some dental 
work done and they got a root canal or 

1905
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:05,721
whatever it was,
but they injected 25 vials of like lie 

1906
01:17:05,721 --> 01:17:06,990
to Canaan,
Novacane and whatever it is.

1907
01:17:06,991 --> 01:17:10,430
And they said that my body was just 
cycling through like instantaneously.

1908
01:17:10,430 --> 01:17:15,430
Right.
So I had all this dental work done the 

1909
01:17:15,430 --> 01:17:15,430
next day I was completely healed from 
all the dental work,

1910
01:17:15,430 --> 01:17:16,490
which is pretty crazy.
Yeah.

1911
01:17:16,491 --> 01:17:19,490
And they said they've never given 
anybody that much lighter cane ever.

1912
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:20,600
Um,
even,

1913
01:17:20,630 --> 01:17:21,210
you know,
and,

1914
01:17:21,211 --> 01:17:21,980
and,
and they're like,

1915
01:17:21,981 --> 01:17:26,981
you know,
the guy asked me if I do coke and I'm 

1916
01:17:26,981 --> 01:17:26,981
like,
no,

1917
01:17:26,981 --> 01:17:26,981
like,
I haven't done that since I was 25.

1918
01:17:26,981 --> 01:17:27,230
He said,
yeah,

1919
01:17:27,231 --> 01:17:28,910
he's like,
normally like nobody can,

1920
01:17:28,940 --> 01:17:33,940
you know,
needs this much unless they have some 

1921
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:35,771
kind of a thing.
And I'm like actually normally really 

1922
01:17:35,771 --> 01:17:35,771
drug sensitive.
I also found that um,

1923
01:17:35,780 --> 01:17:37,450
because I do a,
uh,

1924
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:40,730
hrt and I found that when I did the 
shots like I,

1925
01:17:40,820 --> 01:17:43,820
it was like a lot of people listening to
hormone replacement therapy.

1926
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:45,230
Yeah.
And um,

1927
01:17:45,231 --> 01:17:50,231
and so basically I found that it just 
cycled all these drugs faster through my

1928
01:17:50,421 --> 01:17:53,060
system so I'd get a stronger effect but 
then it be out.

1929
01:17:53,650 --> 01:17:55,520
Um,
and then I went to the gym.

1930
01:17:55,530 --> 01:17:57,770
They said you're not supposed to work 
out for three days or whatever.

1931
01:17:57,910 --> 01:18:02,910
I went to the gym,
I think it was like four or five days 

1932
01:18:02,910 --> 01:18:04,961
later and I was like 20,
I think 20 percent stronger and I mean 

1933
01:18:06,401 --> 01:18:09,290
I've been training for 20 something 
years of done everything.

1934
01:18:09,291 --> 01:18:13,490
So to get like 20 percent strength in 
Greece is just fucking crazy.

1935
01:18:13,850 --> 01:18:16,610
I'm going to Mexico.
It was so part of Mexico.

1936
01:18:16,790 --> 01:18:17,720
Where do you go?
Exactly?

1937
01:18:17,780 --> 01:18:21,580
I had an address Tijuana.
He it so dangerous.

1938
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:23,730
It was like,
it was like Mario had,

1939
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:27,940
I had like the armored cars.
I like made them give me a machine gun.

1940
01:18:27,950 --> 01:18:30,430
I was like,
I had like a machine go,

1941
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:32,130
you want to your own machine going down 
there.

1942
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:33,620
She just,
in case shit goes down.

1943
01:18:33,621 --> 01:18:36,530
You don't want these guys to get shot 
that place like the wild west man,

1944
01:18:36,550 --> 01:18:37,940
you know,
at least I'm going out.

1945
01:18:37,940 --> 01:18:39,040
I want to have a gun,
you know,

1946
01:18:39,510 --> 01:18:41,300
Tiwan,
it seems to me like,

1947
01:18:41,330 --> 01:18:42,620
yeah,
it's the wild west,

1948
01:18:42,621 --> 01:18:45,200
but they don't want to fuck it up 
because there's,

1949
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:50,320
the money's made all through tourism.
Like if somebody gets gunned down or 

1950
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:50,320
kidnap,
nobody wants to go to Tijuana.

1951
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:53,900
So you rarely hear about anything going 
down in Tijuana except those drugs.

1952
01:18:53,901 --> 01:18:55,070
Murders.
Yeah.

1953
01:18:55,071 --> 01:18:58,060
That was just the last ones with those 
beheadings which were,

1954
01:18:58,120 --> 01:19:00,050
that was like a decade.
Pretty gnarly shit.

1955
01:19:00,051 --> 01:19:00,540
I,
I mean,

1956
01:19:00,550 --> 01:19:05,550
I,
I just know that they didn't want me to 

1957
01:19:05,550 --> 01:19:05,550
fly my plane down there.
I did anyways.

1958
01:19:05,550 --> 01:19:05,550
But they're like,
yeah,

1959
01:19:05,550 --> 01:19:08,870
you should probably show and you know,
there's probably drive you drive.

1960
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,710
Not that long.
Uh,

1961
01:19:10,850 --> 01:19:12,050
I don't know.
Last time I went,

1962
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:14,120
I mean I hadn't been down there since 
the military,

1963
01:19:14,121 --> 01:19:18,140
but she seemed like the border crossing 
going back just took forever.

1964
01:19:18,140 --> 01:19:19,850
It's a nightmare and now they want you 
to.

1965
01:19:20,270 --> 01:19:20,930
I mean,
I don't know,

1966
01:19:20,931 --> 01:19:24,420
it just it back in the day it was easy.
We used to walk across the license.

1967
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:25,190
Yeah,
yeah.

1968
01:19:25,210 --> 01:19:25,760
Driver.
Yeah.

1969
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:27,320
That's.
When did he make it a passport?

1970
01:19:27,321 --> 01:19:28,670
Things Canada too,
right?

1971
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:30,250
Yeah,
yeah.

1972
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:31,880
Yeah.
Well Canada has been like that,

1973
01:19:31,881 --> 01:19:36,881
but Mexico I think you said not be like,
or maybe Canada used to be licensed when

1974
01:19:38,151 --> 01:19:40,550
I used to go to Montreal is to know 
you're right.

1975
01:19:40,551 --> 01:19:41,420
You're right.
You're right.

1976
01:19:41,421 --> 01:19:43,010
Because I used to go fishing trips with.
Yeah.

1977
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:45,770
So I don't know.
I don't know how long ago it was,

1978
01:19:45,771 --> 01:19:49,350
but they definitely uh,
definitely changed a lot since you know,

1979
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:51,890
you don't want to get these injections,
you just for no reason.

1980
01:19:52,070 --> 01:19:53,510
I just want,
I did it for no reason.

1981
01:19:53,930 --> 01:19:55,700
Like,
just like,

1982
01:19:55,701 --> 01:19:59,890
fuck it,
we only did it once and I did it twice.

1983
01:20:00,190 --> 01:20:00,630
Twice.
Yeah.

1984
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:03,350
But the second time I just felt like I 
just left.

1985
01:20:03,470 --> 01:20:05,990
I actually went straight from burning 
man down there,

1986
01:20:06,350 --> 01:20:08,130
um,
and

1987
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:10,950
uh,
I only got 70 and I just,

1988
01:20:10,951 --> 01:20:11,430
I dunno,
I,

1989
01:20:11,431 --> 01:20:14,300
I did a fast before,
um,

1990
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:19,360
and I kinda like,
I kinda got sick and then I took some 

1991
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:23,691
antibiotics.
They say you're not supposed to take 

1992
01:20:23,691 --> 01:20:23,691
antibiotics.
I don't know,

1993
01:20:23,691 --> 01:20:23,970
maybe I fucked it up.
I'm not really sure,

1994
01:20:23,971 --> 01:20:28,971
but I just remember the first time was a
distinctly like super strong effect.

1995
01:20:29,740 --> 01:20:34,740
Yeah.
Well I believe boss route and went to 

1996
01:20:34,740 --> 01:20:34,740
South America I think.
Do you remember where he said he went?

1997
01:20:34,740 --> 01:20:36,310
Jamie Peru.
Did you say Peru?

1998
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:37,770
Yeah,
my buddy doesn't.

1999
01:20:37,771 --> 01:20:40,370
Can Cue and I know they were doing it 
and determine a.

2000
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:42,100
yeah,
I think just the door if I,

2001
01:20:42,390 --> 01:20:42,870
you know,
it's,

2002
01:20:42,910 --> 01:20:44,660
it's all,
it's just basically anywhere that is not

2003
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:45,600
the US I think.

2004
01:20:45,730 --> 01:20:50,730
Yeah.
Well we got fucked during the Bush 

2005
01:20:50,730 --> 01:20:53,501
administration when they did these 
sweeping ban on stem cells because the 

2006
01:20:53,501 --> 01:20:58,421
religious right and they went back.
They don't want you to play God and you 

2007
01:20:58,421 --> 01:20:58,760
know,
it wasn't just that they were concerned.

2008
01:20:58,761 --> 01:21:03,761
Stem cells were connected to fetal 
tissue and there was this whole idea 

2009
01:21:03,761 --> 01:21:08,141
that people are going to get abortions 
on purpose just to get the fetal tissue 

2010
01:21:08,141 --> 01:21:08,141
and cell this something.
Yeah,

2011
01:21:08,141 --> 01:21:10,150
and they probably would.
I mean someone probably will.

2012
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:15,520
It probably wouldn't be a lot of people,
but it'd be enough that it would be an 

2013
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:15,860
issue with some folks,
so because of that,

2014
01:21:15,890 --> 01:21:20,890
all these European countries,
especially Germany and got way ahead of 

2015
01:21:20,890 --> 01:21:23,420
the curve when it comes to stem cell 
research and applications in the medical

2016
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:27,800
industry and now what we're seeing now,
you obviously know Regena.

2017
01:21:27,801 --> 01:21:29,270
Keem was invented in Germany.

2018
01:21:29,270 --> 01:21:33,800
That's how I found out about it for a 
knee like fuck.

2019
01:21:33,801 --> 01:21:36,710
I think it was 20 years ago or so.
I'm crazy.

2020
01:21:36,711 --> 01:21:37,730
I mean,
do you know Mickey Rourke?

2021
01:21:38,150 --> 01:21:39,980
I've met him twice.
Tell him to settle down.

2022
01:21:41,510 --> 01:21:42,260
Calm down,
dude.

2023
01:21:43,070 --> 01:21:45,170
It seemed like it seemed like a good 
guy.

2024
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:48,800
Just come down.
He's a whatever you're doing.

2025
01:21:48,801 --> 01:21:53,801
Don't do that anymore.
Just just realize what a fucking actor 

2026
01:21:53,801 --> 01:21:55,110
though the wrath or was it like one of 
my favorite movies?

2027
01:21:55,850 --> 01:21:57,080
Public Greenwich Village.
Man.

2028
01:21:57,081 --> 01:21:58,940
Let me go back to some old shit.
Angel Heart.

2029
01:21:59,340 --> 01:22:00,590
So bad motherfucker.
I mean,

2030
01:22:00,591 --> 01:22:01,340
it's good.
I just,

2031
01:22:01,341 --> 01:22:03,800
the rest of this seems so authentic.
I Dunno.

2032
01:22:03,850 --> 01:22:05,080
It's just uh,
yeah,

2033
01:22:05,081 --> 01:22:10,081
I just liked that movie.
What was perfect for him at the time 

2034
01:22:10,081 --> 01:22:13,000
too,
because he was an older guy and you 

2035
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:13,000
know,
and he was kind of fucked up.

2036
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,830
He let his own the part.
He was perfect for it.

2037
01:22:15,850 --> 01:22:20,850
Now,
now he's a fucking amazing actor and 

2038
01:22:20,850 --> 01:22:20,850
people forget that because he's kind of 
a freak now.

2039
01:22:21,110 --> 01:22:26,110
But if you go back to his earlier stuff 
and you see like how good he was in 

2040
01:22:26,230 --> 01:22:27,260
diner,
you know what I mean?

2041
01:22:27,261 --> 01:22:28,790
He's a fucking.
He was amazing.

2042
01:22:28,820 --> 01:22:31,430
He was amazing.
But uh,

2043
01:22:31,690 --> 01:22:36,690
yeah,
whatever he's doing don't do that 

2044
01:22:36,690 --> 01:22:36,690
anymore.

2045
01:22:36,830 --> 01:22:39,170
But uh,
I know Peyton manning went down there to

2046
01:22:39,171 --> 01:22:40,400
Germany and um,

2047
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:41,980
so now let me ask you,
is that,

2048
01:22:42,010 --> 01:22:44,270
is that stuff band in professional 
sports?

2049
01:22:44,790 --> 01:22:46,400
Red Regena keen?
No,

2050
01:22:46,401 --> 01:22:46,720
no,
no,

2051
01:22:46,721 --> 01:22:47,070
no,
no,

2052
01:22:47,071 --> 01:22:48,720
not the.
Not the healing stuff.

2053
01:22:48,721 --> 01:22:50,720
I'm talking about.
Just like stem cell infusion.

2054
01:22:51,180 --> 01:22:51,810
No,
no,

2055
01:22:51,811 --> 01:22:52,890
not yet.
Oh Wow.

2056
01:22:52,930 --> 01:22:57,350
But could be soon.
You could

2057
01:22:57,350 --> 01:22:58,130
test for that.
I mean,

2058
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:03,240
that's the thing,
what I've been told is you cannot tell 

2059
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:04,130
the difference between a regular,
like a stem cell from you or a stem cell

2060
01:23:04,131 --> 01:23:05,950
from me or whatever if been scrubbed and

2061
01:23:06,050 --> 01:23:07,030
your system.
I mean,

2062
01:23:07,031 --> 01:23:09,460
it's like they said to me as stem cells,
the stem cells.

2063
01:23:09,910 --> 01:23:10,630
Well,
um,

2064
01:23:10,900 --> 01:23:15,900
I paid very close attention to the 
latest cutting edge research for doping 

2065
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:17,320
[inaudible] the UFC.
And because,

2066
01:23:17,321 --> 01:23:22,321
uh,
I'm friends with Jeff Novitsky who was 

2067
01:23:22,321 --> 01:23:24,241
the guy who busted Lance Armstrong,
who's of course the guy who works for 

2068
01:23:24,241 --> 01:23:26,941
the UFC now and he and I talk all the 
time and it's really fucking interesting

2069
01:23:27,910 --> 01:23:32,910
how these people who are trying to get 
ahead or like way they're way ahead of 

2070
01:23:32,921 --> 01:23:37,921
the people that are trying to detect it.
So like now they're developing 

2071
01:23:37,921 --> 01:23:41,431
testosterone from animals,
which is interesting because you're 

2072
01:23:41,431 --> 01:23:41,470
seeing people that are taking 
testosterone.

2073
01:23:41,471 --> 01:23:45,040
It's exoticness testosterone,
but it used to be that they were getting

2074
01:23:45,041 --> 01:23:50,041
it from wild yams.
So what they would do is they'd do 

2075
01:23:50,041 --> 01:23:53,101
carbon isotope tests and they would be 
able to detect that the testosterone 

2076
01:23:53,101 --> 01:23:55,420
inside of your body's not from a 
biological.

2077
01:23:55,421 --> 01:24:00,421
It's not from an animal that 
testosterone is actually coming from a 

2078
01:24:00,421 --> 01:24:00,910
yam is a Mexican Wild Yam.

2079
01:24:00,910 --> 01:24:02,530
It's really interesting.
Um,

2080
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:07,680
but now they're figuring out a way to 
extract it from animals at least 

2081
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:10,921
theoretically.
So Novitsky Levitsky says it like it 

2082
01:24:10,921 --> 01:24:11,500
hasn't been proven yet,
but they're pretty sure.

2083
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:16,560
So what they're doing now is they're 
taking people's pis and blood and then 

2084
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:18,610
they freeze it and they hold onto it for
eight years.

2085
01:24:18,910 --> 01:24:23,910
So the idea is that eight years from now
they're going to find out like new 

2086
01:24:23,910 --> 01:24:24,310
detection methods and they're using 
those,

2087
01:24:24,311 --> 01:24:29,311
the Olympics now,
which is why two Russian Olympic gold 

2088
01:24:29,311 --> 01:24:30,580
medalist in wrestling got their metals 
taken away from 2008.

2089
01:24:30,770 --> 01:24:34,060
Oh yeah.
And they haven't even gone in 2012 yet.

2090
01:24:34,061 --> 01:24:35,410
So there's 2000,
12,

2091
01:24:35,411 --> 01:24:36,730
2016.
I mean there's,

2092
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:41,920
there's,
these guys are going to get fucked over 

2093
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:41,920
for sure.
But you know,

2094
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:44,980
Russia has extensive state sponsored 
anti doping agency.

2095
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:50,600
They also are pretty big advocates of.
I mean they were the ones that started 

2096
01:24:50,670 --> 01:24:52,450
back to.
Yeah,

2097
01:24:52,610 --> 01:24:54,000
yeah.
Well they started it.

2098
01:24:54,001 --> 01:24:59,001
But also what's interesting is the 
scientists that were involved in the 

2099
01:24:59,001 --> 01:24:59,001
program,
they all got whacked.

2100
01:24:59,001 --> 01:25:00,180
They're killing these motherfuckers left
and right.

2101
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:03,660
All the people that know when,
when one guy blew the whistle,

2102
01:25:03,810 --> 01:25:08,810
one of the Russian anti-doping guys blew
the whistle and apparently they just 

2103
01:25:08,810 --> 01:25:12,921
started ice.
And these motherfuckers see if you pull 

2104
01:25:12,921 --> 01:25:12,921
it up,
Jamie,

2105
01:25:12,921 --> 01:25:16,020
like how many Russian anti-doping 
scientists have been murdered?

2106
01:25:17,940 --> 01:25:20,640
They don't fuck around over there and 
they don't fuck around.

2107
01:25:20,670 --> 01:25:21,600
And like,
and,

2108
01:25:21,740 --> 01:25:26,740
and from what I've heard,
like Putin is like really into sports 

2109
01:25:26,740 --> 01:25:26,740
too.
So.

2110
01:25:26,740 --> 01:25:26,880
Oh yeah,
he's into fighting.

2111
01:25:27,150 --> 01:25:29,910
Loves fader fade or million INCO.
Yeah,

2112
01:25:29,940 --> 01:25:33,270
whatever happened to that guy 
motherfucker time.

2113
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:34,610
Motherfucker.
Time got him,

2114
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:36,210
you know.
And Jesus got them,

2115
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:38,080
got super into Jesus.
Oh really?

2116
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:39,210
Yeah.
He uh,

2117
01:25:39,270 --> 01:25:40,950
he changed,
his body changed.

2118
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:41,760
Um,
I dunno,

2119
01:25:41,790 --> 01:25:45,430
it's indicative of his training methods.
I've never really had much of a body on.

2120
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:50,740
It's always say Italy.
It's so strange to be when you see guys 

2121
01:25:50,941 --> 01:25:55,760
like him or especially guys like country
Nelson and this guy,

2122
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:58,590
like I just don't understand how you 
could train all the.

2123
01:25:58,690 --> 01:26:00,910
It looked like,
like it's like so crazy to me.

2124
01:26:00,911 --> 01:26:01,950
Right?
Like I know.

2125
01:26:01,951 --> 01:26:02,910
Especially Roy,
right?

2126
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:03,870
Yeah,
that's what I'm saying.

2127
01:26:03,871 --> 01:26:03,990
Yeah.

2128
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:04,870
Big country.
Yeah.

2129
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:08,370
He wears it like a bag.
A badge of courage too.

2130
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:14,160
I think Roy,
if he just have really got super 

2131
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:16,841
disciplined and lost a ton of way,
he would be fighting at 185 pounds and 

2132
01:26:16,841 --> 01:26:19,040
you'd be knocking motherfuckers to.
It'd be visible with that fucking chin.

2133
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:20,750
This guys,
big crack.

2134
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:23,060
He's like,
the big guys can't knock them out of the

2135
01:26:23,061 --> 01:26:28,061
fucking little guys.
Well unfortunately his chin started to 

2136
01:26:28,061 --> 01:26:30,891
fail him in recent years.
A couple of in Mark Hunt knocked him 

2137
01:26:30,891 --> 01:26:31,850
out.
It was just kinda like time.

2138
01:26:31,851 --> 01:26:32,810
Right.
But I'm just saying like,

2139
01:26:33,070 --> 01:26:35,990
genetically the,
I was blessed with the freakiest Chin of

2140
01:26:35,991 --> 01:26:36,860
all time.
Crazy.

2141
01:26:36,861 --> 01:26:37,520
Right.
So it's like.

2142
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:43,240
But I just,
I never understood how you could train 

2143
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:43,730
that much because,
I mean obviously it's genetics,

2144
01:26:43,731 --> 01:26:44,800
but I just remember,
you know,

2145
01:26:44,910 --> 01:26:49,910
when I was in the military like going 
through and I'll eat like pizza is audi 

2146
01:26:49,910 --> 01:26:49,910
butter.

2147
01:26:49,910 --> 01:26:54,410
I mean I was trying to like gain fat 
because it's so fucking cold in this 

2148
01:26:54,410 --> 01:26:54,830
water.
I couldn't do it.

2149
01:26:55,670 --> 01:26:58,400
Granted we were training more hours but 
like fuck,

2150
01:26:58,401 --> 01:26:59,690
I don't know.
I mean a lot of these,

2151
01:26:59,691 --> 01:27:00,950
you know,
UFC guys that I know,

2152
01:27:00,951 --> 01:27:03,200
they train six hours a day and it was 
just like,

2153
01:27:03,330 --> 01:27:05,270
I don't know what Roy eats,
but it's not good.

2154
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:09,230
Whatever it is,
it's most likely a lot of carbs,

2155
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:11,750
most likely he's just taken in a lot of 
sugar,

2156
01:27:11,751 --> 01:27:14,540
a lot of carbs and his body doesn't know
what to do with it and it just,

2157
01:27:14,690 --> 01:27:16,650
he must just have a slow metabolism.
Just,

2158
01:27:17,340 --> 01:27:19,190
I don't know.
I mean he certainly trains hard.

2159
01:27:19,191 --> 01:27:20,450
He's got endurance.
I mean,

2160
01:27:20,451 --> 01:27:23,120
Roy doesn't gas out.
I mean he gets tired like everybody else

2161
01:27:23,121 --> 01:27:24,860
does,
but it's not like a fatigue issue.

2162
01:27:24,930 --> 01:27:26,720
She didn't know.
What's crazy is.

2163
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:31,720
I knew Roy way back in the day and Roy 
was known as being a really good 

2164
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:33,440
grappler.
He was a Brazilian Jujitsu competitor.

2165
01:27:33,441 --> 01:27:36,470
I knew him before he ever did MMA and 
when he did mma,

2166
01:27:36,530 --> 01:27:37,580
my thought was,
oh,

2167
01:27:37,581 --> 01:27:42,581
well,
you're going to see some high level 

2168
01:27:42,581 --> 01:27:42,581
grappling from this guy.
This guy's like a stud on the mat.

2169
01:27:42,581 --> 01:27:43,860
Nope.
Just started bombing on the ground.

2170
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:44,930
Yeah,
hardly ever.

2171
01:27:45,170 --> 01:27:50,170
Well,
the one time we really see his Jujitsu 

2172
01:27:50,170 --> 01:27:51,430
was in the Andre Arlovski fight when 
he's fighting elite ECC,

2173
01:27:51,740 --> 01:27:53,390
took our lawsky down.
Hadn't been signed control,

2174
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:56,180
but elite not elite.
ECC was.

2175
01:27:56,360 --> 01:28:01,360
They were really corrupt and they had 
this weird thing where if you on the 

2176
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:01,550
ground from whether 15 seconds it 
standing up,

2177
01:28:01,670 --> 01:28:06,670
so he's on the ground inside control 
with a double double wrist lock going 

2178
01:28:06,670 --> 01:28:09,110
for memorial on Orlowski and they stand 
them up.

2179
01:28:09,620 --> 01:28:11,150
Anyone up getting stopped by Orlowski.

2180
01:28:11,180 --> 01:28:13,070
But that was.
But that was that.

2181
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:16,970
They were making Kimbo slice their,
their poster boy,

2182
01:28:16,971 --> 01:28:21,971
and it was like Gary Shaw was promoting 
and he was a boxing guy and he had his 

2183
01:28:21,971 --> 01:28:25,550
own idea about how to promote it and if 
they weren't mma friendly it was just,

2184
01:28:25,551 --> 01:28:30,551
they wanted excitement.
They didn't really want to promote like 

2185
01:28:30,551 --> 01:28:30,680
in a pure sense of the sport,
you know,

2186
01:28:30,681 --> 01:28:32,450
so it was a,
the whole thing was kind of fucked.

2187
01:28:32,510 --> 01:28:37,510
But I remember I saw Kimbo was down in 
Miami and I saw one of his fights or 

2188
01:28:37,510 --> 01:28:40,931
whatever and they had like some 
alternate gallic coming off the couch 

2189
01:28:40,931 --> 01:28:40,931
and this guidance document.
Wait,

2190
01:28:40,931 --> 01:28:41,360
seth petrus,
len seconds.

2191
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:44,870
So that was a bad fight.
They should have never taken that fight.

2192
01:28:44,990 --> 01:28:49,120
Seth Petrocelli's very good.
And when I saw that I had known that Kim

2193
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:54,120
Boses a tough guy.
He was a really good guy to 

2194
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:56,800
unfortunately he passed away recently.
Just kind of fucked up because he had a 

2195
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:57,740
bad heart and he was scheduled for 
another fight.

2196
01:28:58,230 --> 01:29:00,600
They ever figured out what it was.
It was just had heart disease,

2197
01:29:00,810 --> 01:29:02,430
congenital heart defect,

2198
01:29:02,940 --> 01:29:03,840
you know?
I mean,

2199
01:29:04,020 --> 01:29:09,020
I don't know if it was genetic,
I don't know if it's something that 

2200
01:29:09,020 --> 01:29:09,020
happened along the way,
I don't know,

2201
01:29:09,020 --> 01:29:12,570
but he was a really good guy,
like pretty much universally loved.

2202
01:29:13,140 --> 01:29:15,060
Really good guy.
His story is so crazy.

2203
01:29:15,061 --> 01:29:18,300
I heard the guy that basically almost 
like walked onto the football team.

2204
01:29:18,310 --> 01:29:19,230
Yeah.
Yes.

2205
01:29:20,330 --> 01:29:21,670
Living on the streets,
like,

2206
01:29:22,290 --> 01:29:23,550
yeah,
I mean just a tough,

2207
01:29:23,551 --> 01:29:27,280
tough guy knew how to punch and um,
you know what,

2208
01:29:27,290 --> 01:29:32,290
when I found out about him,
I found out about them like everybody 

2209
01:29:32,290 --> 01:29:34,971
else did these youtube videos.
Did you ever see when he fought Sean 

2210
01:29:34,971 --> 01:29:36,900
Gannon,
Gannon was a cop.

2211
01:29:37,020 --> 01:29:37,940
Oh yes.
Yeah,

2212
01:29:37,941 --> 01:29:38,790
yeah.
The White Guy,

2213
01:29:38,791 --> 01:29:39,380
right?
Yeah.

2214
01:29:39,690 --> 01:29:44,690
It's all big white guy.
See if you find that in Sean Gannon 

2215
01:29:44,690 --> 01:29:48,770
versus Kimbo slice.
They had a Dojo war and he was a cop in 

2216
01:29:48,770 --> 01:29:52,671
Massachusetts and uh,
he got in trouble for beaten up Kimbo 

2217
01:29:53,820 --> 01:29:56,820
and like he got suspended I think from 
the police force.

2218
01:29:56,850 --> 01:29:57,780
Yeah,
there he is right there.

2219
01:29:57,781 --> 01:29:59,100
This is a crazy fight,
man.

2220
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:02,910
They just had this one,
this brawl in the middle of this Dojo.

2221
01:30:02,911 --> 01:30:05,370
I think Kenny Florian was there and 
people were posted.

2222
01:30:05,371 --> 01:30:10,371
This was a mixed martial arts.com,
which is the greatest martial arts 

2223
01:30:10,371 --> 01:30:11,010
website on the Internet.
Uh,

2224
01:30:11,310 --> 01:30:14,340
back in the day.
We all watch this shit live.

2225
01:30:14,370 --> 01:30:16,080
I don't remember if we had to pay for 
it.

2226
01:30:16,081 --> 01:30:19,940
It was streaming on some website or 
something like that as a of data,

2227
01:30:19,970 --> 01:30:23,130
like an aeronautical number.
This I definitely remember being like,

2228
01:30:23,131 --> 01:30:25,710
fuck,
this guy could fucking hodges oh yeah.

2229
01:30:25,711 --> 01:30:27,510
Well we got tested,
right?

2230
01:30:27,540 --> 01:30:32,540
Yeah.
This is what John Gannon is a tough 

2231
01:30:32,540 --> 01:30:33,570
motherfucker.
I mean tough as hell.

2232
01:30:33,670 --> 01:30:38,400
Long time cop real martial artists had a
bunch of pro fights and uh,

2233
01:30:38,460 --> 01:30:41,230
there was like all these discrepancies 
about the rules because he's got them in

2234
01:30:41,231 --> 01:30:46,231
a standing guillotine and they're,
they're trying to break it up and 

2235
01:30:46,231 --> 01:30:46,500
there's all,
you got to let go and all this different

2236
01:30:46,501 --> 01:30:46,740
shit.

2237
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:50,310
So He lets go and then it winds up going
to the ground like there was,

2238
01:30:50,340 --> 01:30:52,680
it was all stacked against Gannon.
Yeah.

2239
01:30:52,710 --> 01:30:57,710
Because you know,
they didn't want to get submitted and 

2240
01:30:57,710 --> 01:30:57,710
nobody wants to die.
Right?

2241
01:30:57,710 --> 01:30:58,270
Yeah.
And you know,

2242
01:30:58,290 --> 01:31:03,290
again has got ahold of this good team,
he doesn't want to let it go and then 

2243
01:31:03,290 --> 01:31:03,290
Kimbo winds up getting them down on the 
ground.

2244
01:31:03,290 --> 01:31:05,700
So then kimball's ground and pounded 
them see like this,

2245
01:31:05,850 --> 01:31:10,850
this is supposed to be illegal to,
you're not supposed to be able to do 

2246
01:31:10,850 --> 01:31:10,860
this.
But gannon had a fucking head,

2247
01:31:10,861 --> 01:31:15,510
like a fire hydrant and it just super 
game and great endurance.

2248
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:19,080
And so kimball is used to taking these 
guys out and he couldn't take in and out

2249
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:22,770
again and eventually beat him down and 
they had some crazy nonsense,

2250
01:31:22,771 --> 01:31:25,250
like a 30 count.
Like when he goes down,

2251
01:31:25,270 --> 01:31:27,930
you count the 30 before you get back up,
I'm not kidding.

2252
01:31:28,580 --> 01:31:32,490
And he beat it once he beat it once.
And then Gannon got him,

2253
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:36,420
knocked him down again.
But like you could see Kimbo starting to

2254
01:31:36,421 --> 01:31:38,640
get tired and that was the big thing.
But.

2255
01:31:38,641 --> 01:31:43,641
So he goes from this and then starts 
fighting in elite ECC and has some great

2256
01:31:44,191 --> 01:31:45,030
fights.
Man.

2257
01:31:45,031 --> 01:31:46,950
Some really good fights that James 
Thompson.

2258
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:52,200
It was kind of controversial as well.
But I knew him as like a pretty tough.

2259
01:31:53,420 --> 01:31:58,420
I mean really tough,
but as far as like professional 

2260
01:31:58,420 --> 01:31:58,420
skillset,
you know,

2261
01:31:58,420 --> 01:31:59,890
he wasn't like the elite level

2262
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:01,600
and so when he fought Petros Lee,
I was like,

2263
01:32:01,660 --> 01:32:03,010
oh my God,
he's going to get fucked up.

2264
01:32:03,011 --> 01:32:08,011
Like this is a terrible fight for him.
Petrocelli's like it's a world class 

2265
01:32:08,011 --> 01:32:10,720
fighter that happened real quick now.
I remember I was.

2266
01:32:10,721 --> 01:32:11,700
Yeah,
it was like front row.

2267
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:15,760
So tell me about your heart attacks if 
you can't show me the video.

2268
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:17,800
Yeah.
So basically,

2269
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:19,540
yeah,
I,

2270
01:32:19,541 --> 01:32:20,370
uh,
I was,

2271
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,890
I think it was 25.
I was on a ski trip.

2272
01:32:23,891 --> 01:32:27,970
My fraternity brothers were in Park 
City,

2273
01:32:27,971 --> 01:32:32,320
Utah Park City and we've just been 
partying.

2274
01:32:32,321 --> 01:32:32,940
I,
I,

2275
01:32:32,950 --> 01:32:34,960
uh,
I met this chick and the lyft line ended

2276
01:32:34,961 --> 01:32:39,961
up getting her number and it went to the
bar and I got like everybody shit faced.

2277
01:32:40,651 --> 01:32:41,830
It was like 300 bucks,
right?

2278
01:32:41,860 --> 01:32:43,110
Cut the whole bar drunk.
We're,

2279
01:32:43,111 --> 01:32:43,960
you know,
we're having fun.

2280
01:32:43,961 --> 01:32:48,961
We go back to her house or banging until
like seven in the morning or six in the 

2281
01:32:48,961 --> 01:32:50,740
morning and then I get a call,
like I just showered.

2282
01:32:50,740 --> 01:32:55,740
I was like,
just started sleeping on my buddy's 

2283
01:32:55,740 --> 01:32:55,740
like,
hey,

2284
01:32:55,740 --> 01:32:55,740
it's the last fucking day.
Like we're going like,

2285
01:32:55,740 --> 01:32:58,150
let's ride.
And I was just like,

2286
01:32:58,240 --> 01:32:59,440
ah,
fuck it.

2287
01:32:59,441 --> 01:33:00,100
Alright,
sure.

2288
01:33:00,101 --> 01:33:02,010
So I took a shot and drink,
have copied,

2289
01:33:02,230 --> 01:33:03,350
got my shit on,
went out.

2290
01:33:03,351 --> 01:33:04,810
We shot of booze.
Yeah.

2291
01:33:04,811 --> 01:33:06,550
Shot of Tequila.
Jesus Christ.

2292
01:33:07,260 --> 01:33:07,850
Fuck.
I mean,

2293
01:33:07,870 --> 01:33:12,870
you know what I mean if you don't,
if you keep drinking you don't get hung 

2294
01:33:12,870 --> 01:33:12,870
over.
Right.

2295
01:33:12,870 --> 01:33:15,781
So I was just like fuck it.
So when wrote all day and then that 

2296
01:33:16,181 --> 01:33:17,290
night,
I don't know,

2297
01:33:17,620 --> 01:33:19,480
I don't know if it was like a stomach 
flu or what,

2298
01:33:19,481 --> 01:33:24,481
but I was just like puke in and I just 
felt like shit and I just couldn't keep 

2299
01:33:24,481 --> 01:33:28,711
anything down.
I remember I paid like the hotel guy 

2300
01:33:28,711 --> 01:33:30,901
like 100 bucks or getting a bunch of 
gatorades that couldn't even like leave 

2301
01:33:30,901 --> 01:33:30,901
my room.

2302
01:33:30,901 --> 01:33:34,570
So next day go to the airport.
When I knew that if I got nivea I'd feel

2303
01:33:34,571 --> 01:33:36,200
better because I've like had some,
you know,

2304
01:33:36,370 --> 01:33:41,370
you know when you get dehydrated that's 
usually like the root of most of your 

2305
01:33:41,370 --> 01:33:43,861
problems.
So I just like ended up buying an ivy 

2306
01:33:43,861 --> 01:33:44,290
from this medic because the guy's like,
well if I hook this up to you,

2307
01:33:44,291 --> 01:33:45,730
you know,
like you're not gonna be able to fly.

2308
01:33:45,731 --> 01:33:46,420
And I was like,
dude,

2309
01:33:46,421 --> 01:33:47,010
like,
you know,

2310
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:49,110
I gave him a bunch of bullshit.
I was gone,

2311
01:33:49,170 --> 01:33:54,170
you know,
fucking medic from the military and you 

2312
01:33:54,170 --> 01:33:54,170
know,
this and that and I'm,

2313
01:33:54,170 --> 01:33:54,170
you know,
qualified to do that.

2314
01:33:54,370 --> 01:33:55,950
Anyway,
this guy ended up fucking salary.

2315
01:33:55,960 --> 01:33:59,440
The bag basically just gave it to me.
I hooked it up myself,

2316
01:33:59,441 --> 01:34:01,870
like on the plane.
And you haven't done this before?

2317
01:34:02,350 --> 01:34:07,350
Yeah,
we did it a couple times when we're in 

2318
01:34:07,350 --> 01:34:07,350
buds,
like if we went out drinking or whatever

2319
01:34:07,350 --> 01:34:09,250
and uh,
and we had to train the next day or this

2320
01:34:09,251 --> 01:34:10,890
is a commercial flight or a private 
flight?

2321
01:34:10,890 --> 01:34:11,860
Commercial.
Yeah.

2322
01:34:11,861 --> 01:34:15,190
So a pro commercial flight.
You Hook up an IV bag?

2323
01:34:15,220 --> 01:34:16,450
Yeah.
Well in the bathroom,

2324
01:34:16,451 --> 01:34:16,780
like,
yeah,

2325
01:34:16,781 --> 01:34:17,920
before I got on there.
Right.

2326
01:34:17,921 --> 01:34:19,840
So I go in the bathroom,
like hooked this thing up,

2327
01:34:19,841 --> 01:34:20,920
you know?
Yeah.

2328
01:34:20,980 --> 01:34:22,750
You ain't got to wait like an hour.
Right.

2329
01:34:22,751 --> 01:34:27,751
So I'm like,
what else we're gonna do is I fucking 

2330
01:34:27,751 --> 01:34:27,751
hook this thing up.
Start feeling better.

2331
01:34:27,751 --> 01:34:29,020
Go to Vegas.
How long did you let it drip in there?

2332
01:34:29,021 --> 01:34:31,810
For?
Probably 20 minutes.

2333
01:34:31,811 --> 01:34:36,811
I was like,
he just locked the bezirk in the 

2334
01:34:36,811 --> 01:34:36,811
bathroom and just.
Yeah,

2335
01:34:36,811 --> 01:34:37,600
just hooked it up and fucking bang on 
the door.

2336
01:34:37,601 --> 01:34:38,680
Hey Dude,
I'm going to take a shit.

2337
01:34:38,681 --> 01:34:39,120
Nah,
no.

2338
01:34:39,130 --> 01:34:40,520
It was like,
no,

2339
01:34:40,650 --> 01:34:45,650
I'm pretty sure it was in the airport.
I mean it's just been like fucking 11 

2340
01:34:45,650 --> 01:34:45,650
slash 12 years.
But yeah,

2341
01:34:45,650 --> 01:34:46,130
it was,
I think it was a,

2342
01:34:46,370 --> 01:34:47,980
it wasn't uh,
wasn't on the plane.

2343
01:34:47,981 --> 01:34:52,981
It was like in the sort of thing and so,
you know,

2344
01:34:53,260 --> 01:34:54,170
I just,
you know,

2345
01:34:54,190 --> 01:34:55,760
and so I sorta sketchy started.
Yeah,

2346
01:34:55,820 --> 01:34:58,250
super sketchy.
I don't even know if I use alcohol

2347
01:34:58,250 --> 01:35:00,430
and such a scumbag.
So I uh,

2348
01:35:01,310 --> 01:35:03,050
yeah.
So I get to Vegas,

2349
01:35:03,051 --> 01:35:04,850
I'm like feeling a little bit better.
I'm just like,

2350
01:35:04,851 --> 01:35:06,800
I'm such a sick.
I'll want to go gamble.

2351
01:35:06,801 --> 01:35:08,900
Right.
Like I should've gone and checked into.

2352
01:35:08,901 --> 01:35:10,160
Oh yeah,

2395
01:36:19,311 --> 01:36:19,970
I'm just like,

2396
01:36:19,971 --> 01:36:21,530

to bang her.

2397
01:36:21,531 --> 01:36:23,180
I'm like,
I don't want to get slapped again.

2398
01:36:23,181 --> 01:36:25,190
I was just so like,

2399
01:36:25,191 --> 01:36:25,590

you know,

2400
01:36:25,610 --> 01:36:26,520
get your shit load.
We go,

2401
01:36:26,521 --> 01:36:27,830
let's get out of here,
let's go out to party.

2402
01:36:28,070 --> 01:36:29,210
So I talked to my buddy,
I'm like,

2403
01:36:29,211 --> 01:36:29,960
Hey,
like I need it,

2404
01:36:30,140 --> 01:36:32,240
I need a bag or some kind of Dick pill 
or something,

2405
01:36:32,241 --> 01:36:33,580
you know,
and I'd never taken Viagara.

2406
01:36:33,620 --> 01:36:35,360
So I didn't really know the dosing or 
whatever.

2407
01:36:35,361 --> 01:36:37,820
So he gives me the 100 milligram one,
which is for fucking,

2408
01:36:37,821 --> 01:36:40,730
if you don't know anything about Viagra 
for like geriatrics,

2409
01:36:40,731 --> 01:36:43,370
right business thing.
I take the whole thing.

2410
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:46,220
I don't know,
like a minute goes by and I'm like,

2411
01:36:46,221 --> 01:36:49,200
the fucking thing isn't working,
you know,

2412
01:36:49,290 --> 01:36:54,290
coked up.
I think it seems like it's been at our 

2413
01:36:54,290 --> 01:36:54,290
right guys.

2414
01:36:54,290 --> 01:36:56,240
Like it hasn't been good enough to give 
me the fucking again another pill.

2415
01:36:56,510 --> 01:36:57,530
And uh,
so no.

2416
01:36:57,540 --> 01:36:58,430
So he said,
he's like,

2417
01:36:58,431 --> 01:37:00,770
no,
you can like give me the fucking thing.

2418
01:37:00,980 --> 01:37:03,320
So it gives me another user only take 
half.

2419
01:37:03,321 --> 01:37:04,100
He's like don't,
you know,

2420
01:37:04,101 --> 01:37:05,920
don't take this.
And so anyways,

2421
01:37:05,921 --> 01:37:09,260
so I'd take another half,
wait like five minutes,

2422
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:10,490
do some more blow.
And I'm like,

2423
01:37:10,491 --> 01:37:12,950
oh my Dick's not hard.
Like the girls aren't even around like I

2424
01:37:12,951 --> 01:37:15,320
have no,
like sexual esteem is no even reason for

2425
01:37:15,321 --> 01:37:15,980
my Dick.
The yard.

2426
01:37:15,981 --> 01:37:20,981
Right.
But it's like in my mind I'm like 

2427
01:37:20,981 --> 01:37:20,981
overthinking it,
which makes it worse,

2428
01:37:20,981 --> 01:37:20,981
right?
So I'm like fuck it.

2429
01:37:20,981 --> 01:37:23,180
So I take the other half.
So now I'm like 200 milligrams into this

2430
01:37:23,181 --> 01:37:25,010
fucking bag or which is like,
you know,

2431
01:37:25,250 --> 01:37:27,650
double the absolute Max from what,
uh,

2432
01:37:27,660 --> 01:37:32,660
you know,
some guys have to get their Dick 

2433
01:37:32,660 --> 01:37:32,660
drained,
right?

2434
01:37:32,660 --> 01:37:32,660
Yeah,
yeah.

2435
01:37:32,660 --> 01:37:36,251
Well we'll get to that.
So go back to my hotel and I'm like,

2436
01:37:36,770 --> 01:37:38,900
fucking banging the shit out of this 
girl.

2437
01:37:38,901 --> 01:37:39,350
Like,
you know,

2438
01:37:39,351 --> 01:37:41,510
I mean I got like veins coming out of my
head.

2439
01:37:41,511 --> 01:37:44,240
I'm sweating profusely and I'm like 
doing blue.

2440
01:37:44,460 --> 01:37:46,660
I'd fucked her for like maybe like 45,
50 minutes.

2441
01:37:46,661 --> 01:37:49,580
Like it wasn't not pleasurable at all if
this was like work,

2442
01:37:49,790 --> 01:37:50,720
right?
I'm just like.

2443
01:37:51,080 --> 01:37:52,580
And after like,
fuck man,

2444
01:37:52,581 --> 01:37:54,200
I think it was like 50 minutes.
I just like,

2445
01:37:54,201 --> 01:37:55,800
I just quit.
Like I was just like,

2446
01:37:55,801 --> 01:37:56,100
I just,

2447
01:37:56,180 --> 01:38:01,180
you know,
I just knew there was zero chance of me 

2448
01:38:01,180 --> 01:38:03,111
coming and I was like,
punished this chick enough and I'm just 

2449
01:38:03,111 --> 01:38:03,660
like.
And I like didn't like I was tired.

2450
01:38:03,661 --> 01:38:06,360
I went in the bathroom,
took a cold shower,

2451
01:38:06,660 --> 01:38:11,160
my dick like wouldn't go down like I and
I ordered some room service,

2452
01:38:11,161 --> 01:38:14,170
end of like tucking it up into my waist.
And um,

2453
01:38:14,200 --> 01:38:16,590
because it's like there's just no going 
down for this bucket thing,

2454
01:38:16,591 --> 01:38:20,040
right?
It's ether room service I think.

2455
01:38:20,130 --> 01:38:25,130
Oh yeah.
Then I actually ended up taking a 

2456
01:38:25,130 --> 01:38:25,590
volume,
went to sleep banger again,

2457
01:38:25,770 --> 01:38:27,960
woke up,
went and ate some Mexican food.

2458
01:38:27,961 --> 01:38:31,320
I was like,
betting on the sports game and I started

2459
01:38:31,321 --> 01:38:36,321
getting like this pain in my shoulder 
and I didn't really like know what it 

2460
01:38:36,321 --> 01:38:37,110
was like.
It kind of just felt like a,

2461
01:38:37,111 --> 01:38:42,111
like an ache.
So started doing pushups that didn't 

2462
01:38:42,111 --> 01:38:42,111
really make it feel any better.

2463
01:38:42,111 --> 01:38:44,010
And I was like stretching my arm and I 
was like trying to sleep,

2464
01:38:44,011 --> 01:38:46,020
but I couldn't even lay on that side.
I'm just like,

2465
01:38:46,021 --> 01:38:51,021
what the fuck?
Like heart attack never even entered 

2466
01:38:51,021 --> 01:38:51,910
into the realm of possibility of shit 
that could be wrong.

2467
01:38:51,940 --> 01:38:52,350
Me,
right.

2468
01:38:53,490 --> 01:38:55,070
Like fucking 25,
like I said,

2469
01:38:55,080 --> 01:38:56,250
like shoulder pain,
like wow,

2470
01:38:56,270 --> 01:39:01,270
you know,
I had no idea without having to do a 

2471
01:39:01,270 --> 01:39:03,741
hard time.
So call my mom tardy at the family 

2472
01:39:03,741 --> 01:39:07,251
doctor on the phone.
She calls this dude up and I'm like 

2473
01:39:07,251 --> 01:39:07,251
getting like kind of shorter breaths.
So I'm like fuck.

2474
01:39:07,251 --> 01:39:11,771
So I just hang up the phone and I find 
out the hospitals like 10 minutes away.

2475
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:14,010
So I'm like,
fuck it.

2476
01:39:14,011 --> 01:39:15,510
I'll just get a cap,
be faster.

2477
01:39:16,290 --> 01:39:18,090
I should've gotten an ambulance but I 
got a cab,

2478
01:39:18,710 --> 01:39:19,680
you know,
note to self,

2479
01:39:19,681 --> 01:39:22,110
always get an ambulance if you've got 
any shit because I got the cab,

2480
01:39:22,111 --> 01:39:23,880
I was in the waiting room for like 50 
minutes.

2481
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:25,900
I pulled out like 10 grand out of my 
pocket.

2482
01:39:25,930 --> 01:39:26,700
I told the Lady,
I was like,

2483
01:39:26,701 --> 01:39:28,890
I'll give you 10 grand.
Let me talk to the fucking doctor.

2484
01:39:28,891 --> 01:39:30,450
Like something's wrong here.
I don't know what's wrong,

2485
01:39:30,451 --> 01:39:32,460
but I know something's wrong.
Anyway,

2486
01:39:32,670 --> 01:39:34,130
she take the 10 grand,
fuck no.

2487
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:37,880
Made me sit in the fucking waiting room 
and like 30,

2488
01:39:37,900 --> 01:39:42,900
40 minutes go by.
Finally get seen by doctors like Holy 

2489
01:39:42,900 --> 01:39:45,830
Shit,
like you're having a full blown heart 

2490
01:39:45,830 --> 01:39:47,061
attack.
All that stuff and giving the 

2491
01:39:47,061 --> 01:39:49,300
Nitroglycerin and I call him my dad and 
my mom was like,

2492
01:39:49,301 --> 01:39:54,301
you know,
telling my mom like I'm thinking I'm 

2493
01:39:54,301 --> 01:39:54,301
fucking done.
Right.

2494
01:39:54,301 --> 01:39:57,310
And because this has been going on for 
awhile and I'm like having a hard time 

2495
01:39:57,310 --> 01:39:59,460
breathing.
I'm like in pain and so they gave me the

2496
01:39:59,461 --> 01:40:00,830
nitroglycerin right,
and I,

2497
01:40:00,831 --> 01:40:05,831
I start feeling better.
They do an angiogram or whatever where 

2498
01:40:05,831 --> 01:40:05,831
they check out the heart that said there
was no damage.

2499
01:40:06,150 --> 01:40:09,420
Parents come out the next day I have 
another one and I'm like,

2500
01:40:09,421 --> 01:40:14,421
and I tell the doctor I'm going to say,
and then my doctor was Conrad Murray 

2501
01:40:14,421 --> 01:40:14,421
too,
by the way,

2502
01:40:14,421 --> 01:40:14,500
which is Michael Jackson.
Dr.

2503
01:40:14,580 --> 01:40:16,920
Got it.
Smoked him and the craziest.

2504
01:40:16,950 --> 01:40:21,950
How's you're talking to.
And the spookiest thing about the whole 

2505
01:40:21,950 --> 01:40:24,561
deal was my grandfather had the same 
doctor in the same motherfucking 

2506
01:40:24,561 --> 01:40:26,880
hospital exactly one year prior and 
died.

2507
01:40:27,240 --> 01:40:28,340
So I'm just like,
you know,

2508
01:40:28,350 --> 01:40:30,120
this is not looking good for the home 
team.

2509
01:40:30,450 --> 01:40:35,450
This was before it killed.
Michael Jackson's asked to write sound 

2510
01:40:35,450 --> 01:40:35,450
like,
you know,

2511
01:40:35,450 --> 01:40:36,540
fuck,
I'm just in the hospital.

2512
01:40:36,541 --> 01:40:37,650
So I call my dad.
I'm like,

2513
01:40:37,651 --> 01:40:40,140
I'm having another heart attack.
I tell the nurse and they're like,

2514
01:40:40,141 --> 01:40:41,820
no,
like your thing looks fine.

2515
01:40:42,180 --> 01:40:43,110
I call my dad.
I'm like,

2516
01:40:43,111 --> 01:40:48,111
there's something wrong.
My Dad like comes down to the hospital 

2517
01:40:48,111 --> 01:40:48,111
and sure enough like I'm having a 
second,

2518
01:40:48,111 --> 01:40:48,111
like minor heart attack.

2519
01:40:48,111 --> 01:40:48,780
I'm like,
what the fuck?

2520
01:40:49,290 --> 01:40:53,780
So they do a bunch of tests to say my 
heart's fine and they asked you for like

2521
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:55,660
the list.
So I got to like give him the list.

2522
01:40:55,661 --> 01:40:57,760
And my ex girlfriends there,
my mom's there,

2523
01:40:57,770 --> 01:41:00,130
my dad's there and I'm just like,
started off with like,

2524
01:41:00,131 --> 01:41:00,870
oh well,
you know,

2525
01:41:00,900 --> 01:41:03,040
the smoking some pot.
And he's like,

2526
01:41:03,041 --> 01:41:03,490
well,
you know,

2527
01:41:03,491 --> 01:41:05,200
like,
you better tell us like what you've been

2528
01:41:05,201 --> 01:41:06,270
doing.
It's important.

2529
01:41:06,271 --> 01:41:07,900
We need to figure out what's going on 
with you.

2530
01:41:08,440 --> 01:41:09,870
And I say ah,
and you know,

2531
01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:13,480
did you know I did some ecstasy cocaine 
and like,

2532
01:41:13,481 --> 01:41:16,420
my dad like looks over at me like,
what the fuck,

2533
01:41:16,421 --> 01:41:19,390
you know,
my dad is like Super Square and um,

2534
01:41:19,870 --> 01:41:21,270
anyway,
so then I was like,

2535
01:41:21,271 --> 01:41:22,810
yeah.
And I think it took some Viagra.

2536
01:41:22,820 --> 01:41:26,470
My girlfriend's like fucking writing now
and he's like,

2537
01:41:26,471 --> 01:41:27,010
how much?

2538
01:41:27,010 --> 01:41:28,570
I'm like 200 milligrams.
And he's like,

2539
01:41:28,571 --> 01:41:30,020
why?
I'm like,

2540
01:41:30,290 --> 01:41:32,460
I don't fucking know.
It was good seeing,

2541
01:41:32,461 --> 01:41:34,670
you know,
seem like this was tasing.

2542
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:37,610
That's like an insane amount,
like anyway.

2543
01:41:37,611 --> 01:41:39,830
So I,
uh,

2544
01:41:39,940 --> 01:41:42,430
I ended up staying in the hospital for 
like four days.

2545
01:41:42,431 --> 01:41:46,180
I actually fucked my girlfriend in the 
hospital with all these cords and crazy.

2546
01:41:46,181 --> 01:41:46,970
She'll,
Jeez.

2547
01:41:47,050 --> 01:41:49,780
Yeah.
I smoked a joint in the hospital thing.

2548
01:41:49,781 --> 01:41:54,781
I fucked her,
like I had a buddy of my bringing like 

2549
01:41:54,781 --> 01:41:56,110
wine coolers and Chinese food,
I think the worst patient of all time.

2550
01:41:56,111 --> 01:41:58,060
Right.
And somehow like,

2551
01:41:58,061 --> 01:42:00,460
you know,
so give me all these fucking pills.

2552
01:42:00,461 --> 01:42:05,461
I got to take their telling me like I 
got to take these pills for the rest of 

2553
01:42:05,461 --> 01:42:05,461
my life for the rest of your life.
So they said,

2554
01:42:05,461 --> 01:42:07,150
and I was just like,
after like three days,

2555
01:42:07,151 --> 01:42:09,310
like they fucked my girlfriend eight,
the Chinese food.

2556
01:42:09,310 --> 01:42:09,850
I was like,
okay.

2557
01:42:09,851 --> 01:42:12,640
I'm like back to being invincible again 
through all the shit.

2558
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:15,940
He's a heart attack.
Exactly.

2559
01:42:16,030 --> 01:42:21,030
I've heard that phrase,
but what is the exact medical thing 

2560
01:42:21,030 --> 01:42:21,310
that's going on?
You know,

2561
01:42:21,311 --> 01:42:23,150
for guidance had to.
I should know.

2562
01:42:23,740 --> 01:42:28,740
I don't know.
I think it's just like basically when 

2563
01:42:28,740 --> 01:42:29,390
your heart's not getting enough oxygen 
or something or um,

2564
01:42:29,590 --> 01:42:31,870
I dunno.
It's just not functioning properly.

2565
01:42:31,871 --> 01:42:33,580
Yeah.
Usually there's like a.

2566
01:42:33,581 --> 01:42:35,050
yeah,
there's like a blocked artery.

2567
01:42:35,051 --> 01:42:38,490
There's like something and,
and I think like coke is a,

2568
01:42:38,500 --> 01:42:42,190
is a vasoconstrictor whatever,
so maybe like constricted my veins.

2569
01:42:42,191 --> 01:42:43,890
So there wasn't like an that isn't the 
way I grew up.

2570
01:42:43,891 --> 01:42:48,891
Visal dilator.
She shouldn't have balance it out I 

2571
01:42:48,891 --> 01:42:48,891
think,
but I don't know,

2572
01:42:48,891 --> 01:42:49,150
you know what I mean?
I don't know.

2573
01:42:49,151 --> 01:42:50,770
I don't really know the science behind 
it,

2574
01:42:50,771 --> 01:42:55,771
but I know that like coke and wag or I 
don't think you're supposed to make 

2575
01:42:55,771 --> 01:42:55,771
some.

2576
01:42:55,771 --> 01:42:56,010
I Dunno.
Wow.

2577
01:42:56,230 --> 01:42:57,760
I mean,
I know I did a lot of both.

2578
01:42:59,290 --> 01:43:01,180
Should've canceled it out,
but I guess it didn't.

2579
01:43:01,410 --> 01:43:04,210
I guess my body was like so confused as 
going so directions.

2580
01:43:04,211 --> 01:43:06,370
It's like fuck you to shut down.
I don't know.

2581
01:43:06,660 --> 01:43:07,840
Wow.
But yeah.

2582
01:43:08,530 --> 01:43:10,720
Wow.
That's fucking terrifying.

2583
01:43:10,840 --> 01:43:12,520
Twenty five years old and have a heart 
attack.

2584
01:43:12,610 --> 01:43:13,900
Yeah,
it was pretty crazy.

2585
01:43:13,901 --> 01:43:14,590
Right.
But your heart,

2586
01:43:14,650 --> 01:43:16,910
your heart obviously works great now.
I mean,

2587
01:43:16,911 --> 01:43:21,911
you just,
you did that vegas run crazy bike the 

2588
01:43:21,911 --> 01:43:25,041
book,
which was a fucking hilarious cause you 

2589
01:43:25,041 --> 01:43:27,250
and I were talking about it and then 
Lance Armstrong gets hold of me.

2590
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:28,150
He says,
hey man,

2591
01:43:28,151 --> 01:43:33,151
I don't want to help them.
I remember I got the text view and 

2592
01:43:33,151 --> 01:43:33,151
you're like,
would you want lance to coach?

2593
01:43:33,151 --> 01:43:33,730
I was like,
Oh fuck yeah.

2594
01:43:34,490 --> 01:43:36,940
So what did he do?
Shit in the woods.

2595
01:43:37,900 --> 01:43:42,900
So I mean he,
it was funny because he came out and I 

2596
01:43:42,900 --> 01:43:42,900
was expecting,
I was like,

2597
01:43:42,900 --> 01:43:43,080
okay,
like you know,

2598
01:43:43,090 --> 01:43:48,090
what kind of drugs do I need to do?
I'm like ready to get all doped up and 

2599
01:43:48,090 --> 01:43:48,490
he didn't really want to talk about it 
in the drug shit,

2600
01:43:48,491 --> 01:43:53,491
which was kind of disappointing.
He didn't want to talk about the drug 

2601
01:43:53,491 --> 01:43:53,491
shit.
No,

2602
01:43:53,491 --> 01:43:53,491
no.

2603
01:43:53,491 --> 01:43:57,000
I was like,
I thought this guy would have like some 

2604
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:57,000
like miracle formula.
Right?

2605
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,911
I was like ready to get all hooked up,
but I actually had like a super high 

2606
01:43:59,911 --> 01:44:01,780
humor credit count and he,
he was actually the one that told me,

2607
01:44:01,781 --> 01:44:03,820
he's like,
I think sleep apnea makes it so that you

2608
01:44:03,830 --> 01:44:06,670
have that you can have a really high red
blood cell count.

2609
01:44:06,850 --> 01:44:11,850
So I actually have like the equivalent 
of like the guys that are doing the EPO 

2610
01:44:11,850 --> 01:44:12,510
and doping,
I guess

2611
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:15,460
that helps in some sort of a way.
Well,

2612
01:44:15,461 --> 01:44:16,450
because you're,
you're,

2613
01:44:16,570 --> 01:44:19,210
you're basically at night you're gasping
for air,

2614
01:44:19,350 --> 01:44:21,070
gasping for air,
and you're lacking oxygen.

2615
01:44:21,071 --> 01:44:24,010
So it's Kinda like goes back to the 
whole like sleeping in an oxygen tent,

2616
01:44:24,011 --> 01:44:25,600
right?
So the reason you do that,

2617
01:44:25,601 --> 01:44:30,601
it's because you don't have enough 
oxygen because you don't your body 

2618
01:44:30,601 --> 01:44:33,421
stimulate your red blood cell count and 
because red blood cells are what 

2619
01:44:33,421 --> 01:44:34,600
transports the oxygen.
So the less auction you have,

2620
01:44:34,601 --> 01:44:37,660
the more your body produces that.
Well if it gets to a certain point,

2621
01:44:37,661 --> 01:44:39,640
then your blood kind of turns into 
fucking syrup.

2622
01:44:39,641 --> 01:44:41,050
Right?
So this is amazing.

2623
01:44:41,051 --> 01:44:46,051
Look at that.
A surprising link between sleep apnea 

2624
01:44:46,051 --> 01:44:46,051
and red blood cell count according to 
Sleep Review magazine,

2625
01:44:46,051 --> 01:44:50,431
elevated red blood cell count or a high 
hematic rate is an indicator of a lack 

2626
01:44:50,431 --> 01:44:51,640
of oxygen in the person's body.
That's amazing.

2627
01:44:51,641 --> 01:44:54,280
So sleep apnea can actually give you 
more endurance,

2628
01:44:54,940 --> 01:44:55,600
sort of,

2629
01:44:55,940 --> 01:44:57,000
you know that the attire,
the.

2630
01:44:57,170 --> 01:44:58,820
Yeah,
the problem is you don't really recover.

2631
01:44:58,821 --> 01:45:01,190
So I actually got.
I actually because of him actually ended

2632
01:45:01,191 --> 01:45:03,020
up getting a mouth garbage I think 
helped.

2633
01:45:03,210 --> 01:45:05,220
Uh,
I have a really good one and I know,

2634
01:45:05,221 --> 01:45:10,221
I know a really good doctor.
I don't know if yours is the same as 

2635
01:45:10,221 --> 01:45:10,221
what we'll talk about that letting the 
mom was like 50 bucks online.

2636
01:45:10,221 --> 01:45:13,560
So it's probably not a guide.
It's close to here.

2637
01:45:13,561 --> 01:45:18,561
It's,
it actually pushes down on your tongue 

2638
01:45:18,561 --> 01:45:18,561
because the issue is well with a lot of 
guys,

2639
01:45:18,561 --> 01:45:23,490
mine was they put my jaw,
like it kind of moved my back jaw 

2640
01:45:23,490 --> 01:45:24,110
forward a little bit,
Kinda like gives me an underbite.

2641
01:45:24,130 --> 01:45:24,530
So I suppose

2642
01:45:24,820 --> 01:45:25,780
airway,
but I don't know,

2643
01:45:25,830 --> 01:45:26,870
that's not the best one.
Yeah,

2644
01:45:26,871 --> 01:45:28,530
there's a better one than that.
For me it's,

2645
01:45:28,670 --> 01:45:31,110
it's a life changer.
It changed my fucking life.

2646
01:45:31,140 --> 01:45:33,720
You know,
guys will work out a lot in particular.

2647
01:45:33,721 --> 01:45:38,721
You developed big neck muscles and that 
can constrict the air hole and your 

2648
01:45:39,721 --> 01:45:43,050
tongue can fall back on that.
Especially if you lie on your back.

2649
01:45:43,051 --> 01:45:44,310
Like if I align my back,
dude,

2650
01:45:44,311 --> 01:45:45,060
I,
I sound,

2651
01:45:45,090 --> 01:45:49,350
it sounds hard,
but it sounds like choking and it's just

2652
01:45:49,410 --> 01:45:50,220
terrific.
Yeah,

2653
01:45:50,221 --> 01:45:51,510
I'm in the same boat.
Yeah.

2654
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:53,040
Um,
so,

2655
01:45:53,250 --> 01:45:54,390
so what did he have you do?

2656
01:45:55,880 --> 01:45:57,580
Lance or lance?
Oh,

2657
01:45:57,581 --> 01:45:59,010
so I mean I,
I did it,

2658
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:00,490
you know,
I did a good ride with him.

2659
01:46:00,730 --> 01:46:05,730
We did like some vehicle drafting,
which was actually surprisingly really 

2660
01:46:05,730 --> 01:46:10,081
fucking hard because you have to stay 
close enough to the vehicle to where 

2661
01:46:10,271 --> 01:46:15,271
you're like in that draft.
But then if you get caught by a 

2662
01:46:15,271 --> 01:46:17,911
crosswind and plus if you're,
if you're drafting a vehicle you can't 

2663
01:46:17,911 --> 01:46:19,520
see like what's in the road and if you 
hit any shit in the road,

2664
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:20,260
there's a,
you know,

2665
01:46:20,261 --> 01:46:25,261
because on my race I blew out a front 
tire doing like 30 something downhill 

2666
01:46:25,261 --> 01:46:27,550
and almost crashed.
And I was like on the highway doing this

2667
01:46:27,551 --> 01:46:28,690
too,
so I like,

2668
01:46:28,691 --> 01:46:33,691
you know,
they have those things that wake you up 

2669
01:46:33,691 --> 01:46:33,691
when you're sleeping,
you know,

2670
01:46:33,691 --> 01:46:36,631
there's debate to try hitting that on a 
bicycle with little skinny tires you in 

2671
01:46:36,631 --> 01:46:38,530
like 30 miles an hour.
Like that shit that gnarly.

2672
01:46:38,531 --> 01:46:41,380
So it like sent me into the fucking 
highway and I'm getting passed.

2673
01:46:41,381 --> 01:46:43,450
But like tractor trailers that like 70,
80,

2674
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:45,910
90 miles an hour,
which if you think about it,

2675
01:46:45,911 --> 01:46:47,920
if you're in a car and it lays waste 
5,000

2676
01:46:47,921 --> 01:46:50,040
pounds and it can pull a.
imagine

2677
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:55,040
what it does.
Do a guy on a bike that weighs 200 

2678
01:46:55,040 --> 01:46:56,931
pounds plus fucking 10 bikes.
We didn't explain the bet what was the 

2679
01:46:56,931 --> 01:46:56,931
best.
Oh,

2680
01:46:56,931 --> 01:47:00,540
so it actually originally were in a 
poker game.

2681
01:47:00,541 --> 01:47:01,330
And uh,
Scott,

2682
01:47:01,350 --> 01:47:02,580
Bill Perkins,
he,

2683
01:47:03,210 --> 01:47:04,520
um,
he,

2684
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:09,560
you know,
he just makes crazy best all the time 

2685
01:47:09,560 --> 01:47:11,241
because he's a real rich guy and he 
likes to just fucking make people do 

2686
01:47:11,241 --> 01:47:11,241
crazy shit.
And it's Kinda like,

2687
01:47:11,241 --> 01:47:12,210
you know,
the poker world too.

2688
01:47:12,211 --> 01:47:17,211
So the first bet was he bet my brother 
that he couldn't go three days without 

2689
01:47:17,491 --> 01:47:19,250
saying the word,
the,

2690
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:22,830
I think it was like 100,000,
something like that.

2691
01:47:23,460 --> 01:47:26,550
And then the,
I think he basically just wanted to shut

2692
01:47:26,551 --> 01:47:29,340
my brother up to pay 100 because he was 
like,

2693
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:31,760
fuck you.
So uh,

2694
01:47:31,940 --> 01:47:36,940
well he ended up buying out because he 
realized that my brother was just like 

2695
01:47:36,940 --> 01:47:39,711
such a stubborn asshole that he wasn't 
going to talk for three days and he's 

2696
01:47:39,711 --> 01:47:39,711
like,
married with kids.

2697
01:47:39,711 --> 01:47:44,350
He doesn't have to go out and get any 
pussy and like you could probably just 

2698
01:47:44,350 --> 01:47:47,030
sit home with this fucking miserable 
dogs and just like not talk for three 

2699
01:47:47,030 --> 01:47:48,360
days and just collect a hundred grand.
So you ended up buying out of that.

2700
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:50,880
But that's on the honor system,
right?

2701
01:47:50,910 --> 01:47:55,910
I mean all of this honor system.
I mean that's the thing about the poor 

2702
01:47:55,910 --> 01:47:58,881
communities,
like you lie one fucking time or you 

2703
01:47:58,881 --> 01:47:58,881
don't pay a debt back and you're just 
done.

2704
01:47:58,881 --> 01:48:00,480
Like nobody will fuck with you.
So you,

2705
01:48:00,680 --> 01:48:02,790
you know,
your word has to be good,

2706
01:48:02,791 --> 01:48:03,660
which is kind of like,
you know,

2707
01:48:03,661 --> 01:48:04,950
one of my things which,
you know,

2708
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:10,040
irritates me,
like when people say that I'm not 

2709
01:48:10,040 --> 01:48:10,040
authentic because I take great pride and
like,

2710
01:48:10,040 --> 01:48:13,880
you know,
being fucking 100 percent honest about 

2711
01:48:13,880 --> 01:48:13,880
everything,
you know.

2712
01:48:13,880 --> 01:48:16,700
So,
and that's been like drilled in through 

2713
01:48:16,700 --> 01:48:16,700
13,
14 years ago.

2714
01:48:16,700 --> 01:48:20,500
Gamble.
That's a big one though if you're 

2715
01:48:20,500 --> 01:48:20,500
married because you to be like,
listen,

2716
01:48:20,500 --> 01:48:21,450
it's me with me.
That doesn't count.

2717
01:48:21,650 --> 01:48:23,210
Okay.
You have to save the,

2718
01:48:23,740 --> 01:48:25,210
you know,
know that he.

2719
01:48:25,350 --> 01:48:27,360
Yeah know he,
my brother Woulda woulda told them.

2720
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:29,640
Um,
and so,

2721
01:48:29,710 --> 01:48:32,100
you know,
we're just discussing crazy shit because

2722
01:48:32,101 --> 01:48:33,930
in,
in the poker world I've done crazy stuff

2723
01:48:33,931 --> 01:48:34,980
like one guy,
but another guy,

2724
01:48:34,981 --> 01:48:36,720
5,000
wouldn't jumping the shark tank.

2725
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:41,760
Atlanta's another guy bet that um,
fuck,

2726
01:48:42,481 --> 01:48:44,250
what was it?
I mean I bet fuck,

2727
01:48:44,251 --> 01:48:47,520
I bet $400,000
on a drag race and I hadn't even raced a

2728
01:48:47,521 --> 01:48:49,830
car before.
Um,

2729
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:52,290
and then there was,
there was another,

2730
01:48:52,350 --> 01:48:57,350
there's been so many crazy ones.
I'm just trying to think of the 

2731
01:48:57,350 --> 01:48:59,130
highlight reel a boy.
Um,

2732
01:48:59,940 --> 01:49:02,250
there was one really good one,
um,

2733
01:49:02,550 --> 01:49:04,790
anyway,
so he and abetting,

2734
01:49:04,850 --> 01:49:05,900
um,
I'll think of,

2735
01:49:05,910 --> 01:49:07,800
I'll think of some other ones later,
but he ended up betting.

2736
01:49:08,280 --> 01:49:13,280
He ended up wanting to Bet Rick Solomon 
that he couldn't ride from La to Vegas 

2737
01:49:14,911 --> 01:49:19,911
or Vegas,
la or whatever on a bicycle in 48 hours 

2738
01:49:19,911 --> 01:49:23,330
and rick called one of his buddies that 
has set some Guinness Book of World 

2739
01:49:23,820 --> 01:49:24,990
Records Things and asked him and the 
guy's like,

2740
01:49:25,020 --> 01:49:30,020
look,
like it's not going to fucking happen 

2741
01:49:30,020 --> 01:49:30,020
buddy,
you can't do this.

2742
01:49:30,020 --> 01:49:31,440
And so rick ended up turning down the 
bet and it was just really intriguing to

2743
01:49:31,441 --> 01:49:34,440
me because I'm always up for physical 
tasks,

2744
01:49:34,441 --> 01:49:35,340
you know,
like during,

2745
01:49:35,700 --> 01:49:36,470
during,
you know,

2746
01:49:36,490 --> 01:49:41,490
how you stay up for five and a half days
with no sleep and you run 144 miles like

2747
01:49:42,540 --> 01:49:47,540
boats and telephone poles and you get 
hypothermia and you're doing all this 

2748
01:49:47,540 --> 01:49:47,830
crazy shit.
You don't sleep for five days and you're

2749
01:49:47,831 --> 01:49:48,000
just

2750
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:49,450
going the entire time.
Right.

2751
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:53,380
So I've like put myself through some 
likes and I did two of those.

2752
01:49:53,381 --> 01:49:58,381
Right?
So I've put myself through some real 

2753
01:49:58,381 --> 01:50:01,051
serious,
like physical tests and one of the 

2754
01:50:01,051 --> 01:50:03,931
things that you learned there is that 
your body's just capable of way more 

2755
01:50:03,931 --> 01:50:05,710
than what you think or anybody else 
thinks is capable of doing.

2756
01:50:06,640 --> 01:50:11,640
But one other thing that you learn and 
gambling is that like there's certain 

2757
01:50:11,640 --> 01:50:15,661
things that sound like a good bet that 
just aren't just like drinking a gallon 

2758
01:50:15,661 --> 01:50:17,800
of milk in and hour like that sounds 
pretty fucking easy.

2759
01:50:17,801 --> 01:50:22,801
Right?
But like there's something with the 

2760
01:50:22,801 --> 01:50:23,230
lactose which like most people just 
physically can't do it without puking.

2761
01:50:23,231 --> 01:50:24,880
Right.
Because there's just some weird thing.

2762
01:50:24,910 --> 01:50:25,640
But like,
who would,

2763
01:50:25,641 --> 01:50:30,641
uh,
who would guess that are like saltine 

2764
01:50:30,641 --> 01:50:30,641
crackers?
Like you can't,

2765
01:50:30,641 --> 01:50:33,960
you know what I mean?
Like there's like these weird little 

2766
01:50:33,960 --> 01:50:34,330
things that like sound super easy but 
you just can't do.

2767
01:50:34,820 --> 01:50:39,820
Yeah,
I would think a gallon of milk would be 

2768
01:50:39,820 --> 01:50:39,820
totally doable.
Yeah.

2769
01:50:39,820 --> 01:50:39,820
Right.
But it's like,

2770
01:50:39,820 --> 01:50:40,210
it's a,
it's like a thing.

2771
01:50:40,211 --> 01:50:45,211
I mean,
I remember I like better fraternity 

2772
01:50:45,211 --> 01:50:47,641
brother and he ended up puking like I,
I bet him before his midterm and I 

2773
01:50:47,641 --> 01:50:47,860
remember in his midterm,
you know,

2774
01:50:47,890 --> 01:50:50,770
vomiting on a girl,
kicked out of his,

2775
01:50:50,980 --> 01:50:54,760
like projectile vomited,
like a gallon of milk onto a girl in his

2776
01:50:54,761 --> 01:50:56,590
midterm.
I look pretty fucking brutal.

2777
01:50:57,120 --> 01:50:59,040
A head.
I was like,

2778
01:50:59,140 --> 01:51:00,910
yeah,
we had some funny midterms stories.

2779
01:51:00,911 --> 01:51:03,670
I actually ended up taking my vitamins 
one morning with A.

2780
01:51:03,710 --> 01:51:06,460
I had a thing of Ghb and it looks just 
like water,

2781
01:51:06,461 --> 01:51:07,140
right?
Oh No.

2782
01:51:07,340 --> 01:51:12,340
So I ended up taking like a,
like a full swallow because I had all 

2783
01:51:12,340 --> 01:51:14,050
these horse pills.
I took like a full swig and I was like,

2784
01:51:14,080 --> 01:51:15,730
holy fuck.
I was like,

2785
01:51:15,731 --> 01:51:17,440
I knew like as a guide,
but 20,

2786
01:51:17,450 --> 01:51:19,570
30 minutes before I turned into a 
fucking wild animal.

2787
01:51:19,570 --> 01:51:24,570
Right.
And so I just like got in my car and I 

2788
01:51:24,570 --> 01:51:24,570
drove right down and I called.
My buddy was like,

2789
01:51:24,570 --> 01:51:24,570
hey,
I was like,

2790
01:51:24,570 --> 01:51:26,120
I gotta take this final.
I was like,

2791
01:51:26,290 --> 01:51:28,720
I'm going to be fucking lights out in 30
minutes.

2792
01:51:28,721 --> 01:51:29,740
You got to like,
come pick me up.

2793
01:51:29,741 --> 01:51:31,930
But I got to finish as much as I can.
Right.

2794
01:51:31,931 --> 01:51:35,890
So I go in there and I got like halfway 
through the test and I was just like,

2795
01:51:35,891 --> 01:51:39,030
he ended up like carrying me out.
Um,

2796
01:51:39,260 --> 01:51:40,380
he was black out,
right?

2797
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:42,230
Yeah.
It was a state called the,

2798
01:51:42,400 --> 01:51:45,040
it's a date rape drug.
I think that's real hip.

2799
01:51:45,041 --> 01:51:47,110
Normal.
But he used me as well.

2800
01:51:47,111 --> 01:51:48,610
They've used that on people too.
Yeah,

2801
01:51:48,611 --> 01:51:49,600
you.
Well,

2802
01:51:49,670 --> 01:51:54,670
you'd have to be a real fucking asshole 
to do that because if you mix it with 

2803
01:51:54,670 --> 01:51:56,080
alcohol you can kill somebody.
So I know people have done it though.

2804
01:51:56,140 --> 01:52:01,140
Yeah.
You got to be pretty hard up for pussy 

2805
01:52:01,140 --> 01:52:01,140
to like risk killing the girl.
The fucker.

2806
01:52:01,140 --> 01:52:01,140
But I don't know.

2807
01:52:01,140 --> 01:52:05,690
Have you ever seen.
I'm speaking of the throwing up from 

2808
01:52:05,690 --> 01:52:05,690
drink a two milk.
Too much milk.

2809
01:52:05,690 --> 01:52:07,650
Did you ever see the opiod anthony 
sketch with the baby bird?

2810
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:09,330
Did you ever see baby bird know what 
that is?

2811
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:13,860
Maybe the most disgusting stuff that 
anyone's ever done on the radio.

2812
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:17,370
They had an eggnog drinking contest.
And this dude,

2813
01:52:17,790 --> 01:52:22,260
um,
he drank 72 shots of eggnog.

2814
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:23,850
Is that what it was?
Something like that,

2815
01:52:23,910 --> 01:52:28,910
but then projectile vomited and then we 
were trying to figure out what to do 

2816
01:52:28,910 --> 01:52:29,300
here before he played this pauses for a 
second,

2817
01:52:29,301 --> 01:52:31,740
because I'm explain it.
He knew he was gonna throw up.

2818
01:52:31,800 --> 01:52:35,730
So they had this intern named Pat Duffy,
this intern's fucking crazy.

2819
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:39,330
And I'm dave from,
from knocky.

2820
01:52:39,350 --> 01:52:40,110
No,
who's the other guy?

2821
01:52:41,310 --> 01:52:43,670
Pat Pat from when knocky is the guy who 
throws up and,

2822
01:52:43,690 --> 01:52:45,890
and uh,
Pat Duffy

2823
01:52:46,520 --> 01:52:50,630
is the guy who is laying down there and 
he,

2824
01:52:50,900 --> 01:52:53,960
we were trying to figure out what to do 
with the throw up,

2825
01:52:54,260 --> 01:52:55,610
like you said,
I'm going to throw up.

2826
01:52:55,820 --> 01:52:58,620
And so this guy had done or like,
what was it?

2827
01:52:58,640 --> 01:52:58,840
No,
no,

2828
01:52:58,841 --> 01:52:59,660
no.
He's an intern.

2829
01:52:59,661 --> 01:53:00,710
He's,
he's a fucking animal.

2830
01:53:00,711 --> 01:53:05,711
It's.
And one of them are trying to do 

2831
01:53:05,711 --> 01:53:05,900
anything.
You will fucking do anything for us just

2832
01:53:05,901 --> 01:53:08,360
for the store and just for the gag.
So we say,

2833
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:10,340
okay,
here's the idea,

2834
01:53:10,341 --> 01:53:12,170
because you know,
I was hosting fear factor at the time.

2835
01:53:12,380 --> 01:53:13,250
I go,
here's,

2836
01:53:13,310 --> 01:53:18,310
here's the idea.
You lean your head over the edge of the 

2837
01:53:18,310 --> 01:53:22,030
over the edge of this garbage pail and 
he throws up in your mouth and he's 

2838
01:53:22,030 --> 01:53:22,030
like,
I'll do it.

2839
01:53:22,030 --> 01:53:22,310
And we're like,
no fucking way.

2840
01:53:22,311 --> 01:53:23,870
And I think bill burroughs one who named
it,

2841
01:53:23,871 --> 01:53:25,010
he named it the baby bird.

2842
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:28,940
And so just watch this because the sheer
volume,

2843
01:53:29,030 --> 01:53:32,350
you're not even going to believe that 
this is really all weekend long.

2844
01:53:32,870 --> 01:53:36,200
I'm a caroline's all weekend long.
Here's the plug.

2845
01:53:36,350 --> 01:53:39,740
So pat had done this before.
I mean he obviously,

2846
01:53:39,741 --> 01:53:43,160
he's a giant dude and he was on like 
number,

2847
01:53:43,161 --> 01:53:48,161
like 72 and this other kid,
Pat Duffy sitting there with his head 

2848
01:53:48,200 --> 01:53:53,200
leaning.
He's sitting in a chair leaning back 

2849
01:53:53,200 --> 01:53:54,920
with his head over this barrel and to 
this day,

2850
01:53:54,921 --> 01:53:57,080
I mean they've got tarps all over the 
ground.

2851
01:53:57,710 --> 01:54:02,710
Who else was there fear?
Was there think red band was there to 

2852
01:54:02,710 --> 01:54:04,460
this day?
Maybe one of the best moments of my life

2853
01:54:05,030 --> 01:54:07,610
just because it was so completely 
fucking ridiculous.

2854
01:54:08,060 --> 01:54:09,890
Yeah.
So here it comes.

2855
01:54:10,310 --> 01:54:11,300
He's like,
here we go.

2856
01:54:12,140 --> 01:54:14,530
He takes one last chuck and he's like,
I'm going to throw up this.

2857
01:54:14,740 --> 01:54:16,690
Oh my God,
you haven't seen nothing.

2858
01:54:17,290 --> 01:54:19,960
You haven't seen nothing.
He throws it his face.

2859
01:54:21,660 --> 01:54:24,430
Now look at us now.
It keeps going.

2860
01:54:24,910 --> 01:54:28,480
This is nothing.
When you think it's over,

2861
01:54:28,720 --> 01:54:30,310
it keeps going.
Now Watch.

2862
01:54:30,490 --> 01:54:35,490
You think it's silver.
You think it's over like there's no way 

2863
01:54:35,490 --> 01:54:35,490
he has more and now he's got way more 
inside.

2864
01:54:35,490 --> 01:54:38,650
If I'm looking at,
Oh my God,

2865
01:54:40,310 --> 01:54:44,920
she's actually going to keep watching.
Keep watching.

2866
01:54:45,180 --> 01:54:47,530
He's done.
He's not been done.

2867
01:54:49,600 --> 01:54:52,770
How's it possible?
Holy Shit.

2868
01:54:54,510 --> 01:54:56,710
How is it possible?
Oh my God.

2869
01:54:56,711 --> 01:54:58,480
That was like the chicken.
The midterm.

2870
01:54:58,510 --> 01:55:02,620
Hang on,
hang on more and this is not fake.

2871
01:55:02,830 --> 01:55:04,870
I mean I was there and we were all 
there.

2872
01:55:04,871 --> 01:55:06,040
We all saw this live

2873
01:55:06,080 --> 01:55:07,680
and I think he got his one more inside 
of him.

2874
01:55:07,690 --> 01:55:09,420
Okay.
He gets one more off now.

2875
01:55:09,450 --> 01:55:10,410
He said that's it.
He's done.

2876
01:55:11,850 --> 01:55:12,600
Oh my God.
Hold on.

2877
01:55:12,601 --> 01:55:14,520
I got to have the greatest fucking 
brutal.

2878
01:55:14,840 --> 01:55:19,840
Go ahead.
One of the greatest things I've ever 

2879
01:55:19,840 --> 01:55:19,920
seen in my life.
We're going to get back to this.

2880
01:55:19,921 --> 01:55:23,640
A bike racing story.
Ladies and gentlemen in a moment.

2881
01:55:25,110 --> 01:55:27,170
Ridiculous.
So it's remembering.

2882
01:55:27,180 --> 01:55:28,770
Yeah,
I don't think it was on.

2883
01:55:28,771 --> 01:55:31,440
It might've been on one of the jackass 
movies or the TV show.

2884
01:55:31,620 --> 01:55:36,620
A bams uncle was crazy.
Uncle drank like 70 shots of peach 

2885
01:55:36,620 --> 01:55:37,020
schnapps.

2886
01:55:37,890 --> 01:55:39,880
70 something.
That's right.

2887
01:55:39,900 --> 01:55:42,020
Shitload of Bam.
Bam.

2888
01:55:42,021 --> 01:55:43,710
Margherita.
With Don Vito.

2889
01:55:43,730 --> 01:55:44,470
The big guy.
Yeah.

2890
01:55:44,530 --> 01:55:46,920
Yeah.
70 seven projectile vomiting.

2891
01:55:46,921 --> 01:55:48,390
All.
I think it was said it was a lot.

2892
01:55:48,420 --> 01:55:49,920
It was way more than 20.
I don't know.

2893
01:55:50,820 --> 01:55:55,820
You could die from that.
There was a woman in San Jose or 

2894
01:55:55,820 --> 01:55:59,451
Sacramento,
one of those places where she was doing 

2895
01:55:59,451 --> 01:56:01,200
a radio contest and it was like,
how much water can you drink?

2896
01:56:01,470 --> 01:56:05,670
And she died from drinking water.
Like if you drink too much water,

2897
01:56:05,940 --> 01:56:10,940
you could die the disk.
I get sick from this vomit stuff at all 

2898
01:56:10,940 --> 01:56:11,880
to the kid.
Pat.

2899
01:56:11,950 --> 01:56:14,650
No kids.
Bulletproof just doesn't get sick.

2900
01:56:14,700 --> 01:56:17,730
That guy ate cat shit.
He brushed his teeth with cat shit.

2901
01:56:18,060 --> 01:56:23,060
He also ate fruit loops in the puke.
Like he took a bowl of fruit loops and 

2902
01:56:23,460 --> 01:56:25,980
mixed it with the puke and ate the fruit
loops.

2903
01:56:27,690 --> 01:56:28,610
Yeah.
Um,

2904
01:56:29,010 --> 01:56:30,950
there's people out there that are 
different than you and I,

2905
01:56:30,970 --> 01:56:34,320
Jamie is people that can do things that 
we can't do.

2906
01:56:34,360 --> 01:56:36,750
What's the why?
Why it's just,

2907
01:56:36,751 --> 01:56:39,000
I don't know,
just for the story steps and now I don't

2908
01:56:39,001 --> 01:56:40,320
know what we're talking about them 
though,

2909
01:56:40,321 --> 01:56:42,690
you know what I'm saying?
Like we're talking about,

2910
01:56:42,691 --> 01:56:43,140
um,
so it's,

2911
01:56:43,320 --> 01:56:45,450
it's one of those things like that's why
he did it.

2912
01:56:45,451 --> 01:56:48,420
We're still talking about this isn't a 
world pre youtube really,

2913
01:56:48,421 --> 01:56:50,700
right.
I don't remember when it was.

2914
01:56:50,730 --> 01:56:53,280
It says 2008,
but I don't think that's correct.

2915
01:56:54,300 --> 01:56:59,300
I feel like it was earlier than that.
I feel like it was like 2003 or four or 

2916
01:56:59,300 --> 01:57:02,900
something like that.
I think it was a long time ago is 

2917
01:57:02,900 --> 01:57:02,900
insane.
Right.

2918
01:57:03,450 --> 01:57:04,270
So,
uh,

2919
01:57:04,350 --> 01:57:05,880
I think that was like the guy in 
college,

2920
01:57:06,150 --> 01:57:07,350
so similar to that.

2921
01:57:08,040 --> 01:57:13,040
So back to the bed.
So,

2922
01:57:15,001 --> 01:57:20,001
um,
so the bed is that you can't ride a bike

2923
01:57:21,121 --> 01:57:22,950
from La to vegas,
you have a starting point.

2924
01:57:23,710 --> 01:57:24,830
Um.
Oh yeah.

2925
01:57:24,831 --> 01:57:28,550
So basically it was two is gonna bet 
this guy.

2926
01:57:28,551 --> 01:57:30,140
And he like,
looked into it and he's like,

2927
01:57:30,141 --> 01:57:31,880
Nah,
that's not possible.

2928
01:57:32,660 --> 01:57:34,820
And I was hanging out,
I was just like,

2929
01:57:34,821 --> 01:57:37,700
fuck,
I was like doing some research on it and

2930
01:57:37,701 --> 01:57:40,520
I like looked it up and I like googled,
like,

2931
01:57:40,940 --> 01:57:45,940
you know,
how to prepare for 300 mile bike ride 

2932
01:57:45,940 --> 01:57:46,430
and a month.
And like nothing came up.

2933
01:57:46,431 --> 01:57:50,960
It came up like how to prefer prepare 
for 100 mile in like three months.

2934
01:57:50,961 --> 01:57:52,160
Right.
So I'm just like,

2935
01:57:52,610 --> 01:57:54,390
that's not a good sign.
But I just like,

2936
01:57:54,470 --> 01:57:55,170
I don't know,
someone,

2937
01:57:55,180 --> 01:57:58,190
Bob and just thought it was possible.
Um,

2938
01:57:58,220 --> 01:58:00,260
so like talking to bill is like trying 
to get more time.

2939
01:58:00,261 --> 01:58:01,850
And I talked to like some buddies that 
were cyclist,

2940
01:58:02,270 --> 01:58:07,270
like look,
they're like if you had time to train 

2941
01:58:07,270 --> 01:58:07,270
for this,
like you could do it like,

2942
01:58:07,270 --> 01:58:08,750
but there's fucking no way like just off
the couch you could do it.

2943
01:58:09,400 --> 01:58:10,240
And I'm like,
how long,

2944
01:58:10,250 --> 01:58:10,920
you know,
do I need.

2945
01:58:10,921 --> 01:58:15,921
And they're like minimum three months.
So I'm talking to bill and I kinda like 

2946
01:58:15,921 --> 01:58:16,370
want the bet.
But I'm just like,

2947
01:58:16,371 --> 01:58:18,230
I don't know how much money I really 
want to risk.

2948
01:58:18,920 --> 01:58:23,920
And so he ended up sand that he would 
give me because it's because the initial

2949
01:58:24,201 --> 01:58:26,060
bet was like,
you just had to go do it tomorrow.

2950
01:58:26,120 --> 01:58:27,800
Right.
And I was like,

2951
01:58:27,801 --> 01:58:29,630
there's no fucking way,
like,

2952
01:58:30,200 --> 01:58:31,760
you know,
and then he's like,

2953
01:58:32,150 --> 01:58:34,340
he goes,
well I'll give you a month and I go give

2954
01:58:34,341 --> 01:58:37,920
me.
It was like until x date and it was like

2955
01:58:37,921 --> 01:58:39,770
a little under six weeks.
I was like,

2956
01:58:39,790 --> 01:58:41,290
I'll do it.
And he's like,

2957
01:58:41,291 --> 01:58:42,400
how much do you want to bet?
I was like,

2958
01:58:42,401 --> 01:58:47,401
ah,
it's like 600 grand because I wanted it 

2959
01:58:47,401 --> 01:58:49,580
bad enough to where like I would do it,
but I didn't want to bet too much where 

2960
01:58:49,580 --> 01:58:52,411
it like,
I'd not only like fucking break my ass 

2961
01:58:52,411 --> 01:58:52,411
but like,
you know,

2962
01:58:52,411 --> 01:58:52,720
just lose a shitload.

2963
01:58:52,750 --> 01:58:54,820
So I was like $600.
Seemed like it was a good number.

2964
01:58:55,870 --> 01:58:57,850
So we made the bat and I started doing 
some research.

2965
01:58:57,851 --> 01:59:00,370
So I go down to the bike shop and I'm 
like,

2966
01:59:00,371 --> 01:59:01,480
oh,
like I need a bike.

2967
01:59:01,481 --> 01:59:04,480
Like I'm doing a triple century ride and
the guy's like,

2968
01:59:04,481 --> 01:59:05,960
oh,
like how,

2969
01:59:06,460 --> 01:59:07,570
how much bike?
And I was like,

2970
01:59:07,571 --> 01:59:09,580
oh,
like I haven't been on a bike,

2971
01:59:09,860 --> 01:59:14,860
like ever really?
I did some mountain biking like 19 

2972
01:59:14,860 --> 01:59:14,860
years.
The guy just like La.

2973
01:59:14,860 --> 01:59:18,720
Yeah,
that response you just like laughed at 

2974
01:59:18,720 --> 01:59:18,720
me.
I'm like,

2975
01:59:18,720 --> 01:59:18,720
no,
like really?

2976
01:59:18,720 --> 01:59:22,141
Like I got to do it.
I got like five weeks and he's just 

2977
01:59:22,141 --> 01:59:25,171
like,
he just like looked at me like I was a 

2978
01:59:25,171 --> 01:59:26,530
complete fucking retard and I'm like no,
like I've got a bet,

2979
01:59:26,531 --> 01:59:28,390
like I'm going to do it.
And then the guy's like,

2980
01:59:28,480 --> 01:59:30,340
okay,
like what kind of bike do you.

2981
01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:31,420
I'm like,
I don't know,

2982
01:59:31,421 --> 01:59:34,270
like you're the bike shop looked like I 
didn't have no fucking idea.

2983
01:59:34,271 --> 01:59:36,670
Right.
So it gives me like this race bike,

2984
01:59:36,671 --> 01:59:41,671
which is super fucking uncomfortable.
So I go out and I ride this thing and I 

2985
01:59:41,831 --> 01:59:46,831
wrote it like,
I don't know for like 45 minutes and my 

2986
01:59:46,831 --> 01:59:48,730
ass was just like fucking in so much 
pain.

2987
01:59:49,540 --> 01:59:51,820
And I'm like,
I am fucked.

2988
01:59:52,090 --> 01:59:55,180
Like I think I made it like 11 miles and
I was just like,

2989
01:59:55,181 --> 02:00:00,181
this is going to be really brutal.
And so I ended up finding like a bike 

2990
02:00:00,181 --> 02:00:04,261
where like you could sit down a little 
bit more with like a recumbent or 

2991
02:00:04,261 --> 02:00:04,510
whatever.
It was literally a low rider bicycle.

2992
02:00:04,511 --> 02:00:05,500
Right.
Okay.

2993
02:00:05,501 --> 02:00:08,440
So that'll kind of alleviate a little 
bit of like the ass issue.

2994
02:00:09,250 --> 02:00:11,290
And it gave me like a slightly 
different,

2995
02:00:11,291 --> 02:00:16,291
like pedaling position.
So I got that and then I felt a little 

2996
02:00:16,291 --> 02:00:20,041
bit better about the bat and then I 
talked to like written a little bit but 

2997
02:00:21,311 --> 02:00:25,420
like nothing over like 20 or 30 miles 
and now it's like,

2998
02:00:25,421 --> 02:00:27,340
you know,
Kinda like going hard.

2999
02:00:27,790 --> 02:00:30,550
And then I talked to you and I talked to
lance and lance like,

3000
02:00:30,551 --> 02:00:35,551
Oh,
if you use a fucking any other bike 

3001
02:00:35,551 --> 02:00:35,551
other than a road bike,
like I'm not fucking,

3002
02:00:35,551 --> 02:00:36,610
you know,
I can't have any need to do this.

3003
02:00:36,611 --> 02:00:37,390
And I'm like,
why?

3004
02:00:37,720 --> 02:00:40,580
I don't know.
Because it's like a purist.

3005
02:00:40,730 --> 02:00:43,450
Yes,
he's a bike or out of the fucking no.

3006
02:00:43,750 --> 02:00:45,970
So I'm just like,
well listen buddy,

3007
02:00:45,971 --> 02:00:47,740
I'm betting big money on this.
I'm like,

3008
02:00:47,741 --> 02:00:52,741
I'm going to do whatever the fuck I 
gotta do to fucking make it there on a 

3009
02:00:52,741 --> 02:00:52,741
bicycle.
Right.

3010
02:00:52,741 --> 02:00:56,380
And so anyways,
then I Bet Rick Solomon,

3011
02:00:56,440 --> 02:01:01,440
Rick,
Rick thought I was going to die because 

3012
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:03,270
like the route that I chose was like on 
the freeway and I didn't have a police 

3013
02:01:03,270 --> 02:01:03,850
escort at the time.
So he's like,

3014
02:01:03,880 --> 02:01:08,880
you know,
this guy's gonna be driving on the 

3015
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:08,880
freeway at night,
like there's going to be trucks pass.

3016
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:09,910
And I'm like he's,
he's got a decent chance of dying.

3017
02:01:10,330 --> 02:01:15,330
So.
And he's like in the heart attack thing 

3018
02:01:15,330 --> 02:01:18,600
now actually went to the hospital 
because I was like having some shoulder 

3019
02:01:18,600 --> 02:01:21,121
pain again.
And it felt very similar to the last 

3020
02:01:21,121 --> 02:01:21,121
things I was like fuck.
So Rick is like,

3021
02:01:21,121 --> 02:01:25,980
you know,
he likes while you were training you 

3022
02:01:25,980 --> 02:01:25,980
were having shoulder pain?
Yeah,

3023
02:01:25,980 --> 02:01:28,080
like after I had done like a long ride.
I'm one of the nights like I,

3024
02:01:28,130 --> 02:01:30,090
like I actually went to the hospital,
I was like kind of word.

3025
02:01:30,970 --> 02:01:34,630
And so rick was like saying that and I 
was like,

3026
02:01:34,631 --> 02:01:37,810
well honestly let's bet that I'll bet 
you I don't die.

3027
02:01:37,930 --> 02:01:40,660
And I was like,
I'll give you a because,

3028
02:01:40,860 --> 02:01:42,110
because for me I'm like,
well fuck,

3029
02:01:42,111 --> 02:01:44,360
I can't take it with me if I do die,
like fuck it,

3030
02:01:44,390 --> 02:01:44,850
you know,
like,

3031
02:01:45,560 --> 02:01:50,560
and then it would light up the stakes 
for me without really like too much 

3032
02:01:50,560 --> 02:01:50,560
risk.

3033
02:01:50,560 --> 02:01:50,930
And so I was like,
I'll,

3034
02:01:50,980 --> 02:01:52,940
I like,
I'll bet you whatever the fuck you want.

3035
02:01:52,970 --> 02:01:55,100
You know what I mean?
Like I'll bet you my plane.

3036
02:01:55,420 --> 02:01:56,500
And uh,
and I was like,

3037
02:01:56,520 --> 02:01:59,030
I'll give you.
I think it was like 10 to one or 21.

3038
02:01:59,031 --> 02:02:00,820
I think it was like I gave him like,
fuck,

3039
02:02:00,840 --> 02:02:05,240
I think I initially offered them like 20
to one odds and then we settled it.

3040
02:02:05,241 --> 02:02:05,950
Like,
I dunno,

3041
02:02:06,200 --> 02:02:10,130
it ended up being where he would,
he would lose 250,000

3042
02:02:10,460 --> 02:02:15,460
and I would give him like my plane plus 
my pilots for he got my plane and then 

3043
02:02:15,460 --> 02:02:18,100
I'd pay the pilots for a year.
We like at all you die,

3044
02:02:18,200 --> 02:02:20,060
you had to die.
But if I didn't,

3045
02:02:20,090 --> 02:02:24,710
if I didn't complete the race then it 
was like a wash for me.

3046
02:02:24,711 --> 02:02:27,410
I'm just like fuck.
It was like Rick didn't think I could do

3047
02:02:27,411 --> 02:02:28,100
it,
period.

3048
02:02:28,100 --> 02:02:28,460
Right.
So.

3049
02:02:28,470 --> 02:02:30,980
So he didn't think there was a 
possibility that I could do it.

3050
02:02:31,370 --> 02:02:33,080
And then he thought there was a decent 
chance that he could,

3051
02:02:33,200 --> 02:02:38,200
that I could die.
So for him he thought he was kind of 

3052
02:02:38,200 --> 02:02:40,361
free rolling.
And for me I was free rolling because 

3053
02:02:40,361 --> 02:02:40,361
it's like if I die will okay,
I don't need the fucking plane.

3054
02:02:40,400 --> 02:02:41,790
Ain't going to take me to hell.
Right.

3055
02:02:41,791 --> 02:02:44,390
So like I'm good.
So I made,

3056
02:02:44,810 --> 02:02:49,810
I made the bet with him so.
And then I bet a little bit on the side 

3057
02:02:49,810 --> 02:02:53,171
with somebody else.
I basically had a million bucks on it 

3058
02:02:53,171 --> 02:02:53,171
when I finally ended up doing it and I.
Yeah.

3059
02:02:53,171 --> 02:02:56,540
And I cut a police escort like through 
vegas.

3060
02:02:56,541 --> 02:02:59,000
So it's so funny because I had like 11 
squad cars,

3061
02:02:59,001 --> 02:03:04,001
like blocking off all the intersections 
and here comes this fucking Dildo on a 

3062
02:03:04,001 --> 02:03:04,760
bicycle.
Like riding right through it.

3063
02:03:04,760 --> 02:03:05,750
I'm like,
have all the,

3064
02:03:05,780 --> 02:03:06,410
like,
you know,

3065
02:03:06,430 --> 02:03:09,830
you're expecting like a presidential 
motorcade to come or like,

3066
02:03:09,831 --> 02:03:10,810
you know,
somebody like every,

3067
02:03:10,811 --> 02:03:15,811
like looking to see like what bucket 11 
squad cars blocking off every 

3068
02:03:15,811 --> 02:03:17,660
intersection and here's this fucking 
asshole on a bicycle.

3069
02:03:18,110 --> 02:03:19,730
A lot of people knew that you were going
to do it.

3070
02:03:20,060 --> 02:03:21,350
They didn't know when you were going to 
do it.

3071
02:03:21,570 --> 02:03:24,200
He didn't announce when I didn't want to
announce it because I didn't want people

3072
02:03:24,201 --> 02:03:25,430
to fuck with me.
You know what I mean?

3073
02:03:25,431 --> 02:03:27,470
Like I didn't want fans to like come out
and,

3074
02:03:27,471 --> 02:03:29,510
you know,
or people that hated me or anything,

3075
02:03:29,511 --> 02:03:32,480
right?
I just wanted this bad enough as it was,

3076
02:03:32,481 --> 02:03:35,840
it'd be on the fucking highway.
So,

3077
02:03:35,990 --> 02:03:40,370
um,
I ended up leaving from Vegas and uh,

3078
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:46,000
and I did it in about 32 hours was the 
whoa.

3079
02:03:47,390 --> 02:03:48,200
And what was the bet?

3080
02:03:48,830 --> 02:03:49,460
Uh,
it was,

3081
02:03:49,710 --> 02:03:51,830
it was 48.
Jesus Christ.

3082
02:03:51,831 --> 02:03:52,640
Yeah.
So I,

3083
02:03:52,641 --> 02:03:54,170
I just remember it because there was 
like,

3084
02:03:54,200 --> 02:03:57,680
because he was giving me some shit about
cars I was allowed to draft,

3085
02:03:57,681 --> 02:04:00,570
but he was saying that the van that I 
had had the doors open like,

3086
02:04:00,750 --> 02:04:05,750
because you had to leave the doors open 
because I want to talk to my coach and 

3087
02:04:05,750 --> 02:04:06,800
they were like filming it and stuff.
So we had the doors open.

3088
02:04:07,400 --> 02:04:10,310
So he was like bitching,
rick was bitching about that,

3089
02:04:10,311 --> 02:04:13,640
which was kind of stupid rick to bitch 
about because that was like what made it

3090
02:04:13,670 --> 02:04:18,670
the least safe of all was drafting off a
car because you got to be like six 

3091
02:04:19,610 --> 02:04:23,060
inches from this car and you can't see 
like shit in the road.

3092
02:04:23,090 --> 02:04:25,820
So if they have to slam on the brakes,
you're fucking in the car,

3093
02:04:25,821 --> 02:04:28,280
you're crashing.
And we had times when,

3094
02:04:28,281 --> 02:04:29,540
like there was a.

3095
02:04:30,840 --> 02:04:34,310
yeah,
there was a time when we're on a fucking

3096
02:04:34,311 --> 02:04:35,900
one lane road,
right.

3097
02:04:36,410 --> 02:04:39,300
And there was um,
there was.

3098
02:04:39,780 --> 02:04:43,620
So there's one lane and were in this 
lane and there's lane going this way and

3099
02:04:43,621 --> 02:04:48,450
we had a car come to pass us as another 
car was coming.

3100
02:04:48,451 --> 02:04:52,500
And Miss like our van by like inches and
they were doing like 50,

3101
02:04:52,501 --> 02:04:57,501
60 miles an hour,
like cross if they were to crash out of 

3102
02:04:57,501 --> 02:04:58,590
a dead for sure.
Like it was fucking bad.

3103
02:04:59,160 --> 02:05:04,160
And so like shit got pretty gnarly.
Some of the spots I blew out a tire 

3104
02:05:04,160 --> 02:05:06,080
doing like 30 something miles an hour 
downhill.

3105
02:05:06,150 --> 02:05:08,090
I mean it was like,
who's,

3106
02:05:08,390 --> 02:05:10,860
you rest it all while you're doing this?
Yeah,

3107
02:05:10,861 --> 02:05:14,790
I slept for like an hour or two,
maybe an hour and a half.

3108
02:05:15,300 --> 02:05:20,300
Um,
and then I like stopped to eat but it 

3109
02:05:20,851 --> 02:05:23,580
was mostly just just truck the whole way
through.

3110
02:05:23,770 --> 02:05:27,030
And so you stayed on this recumbent 
style bike the whole time?

3111
02:05:27,060 --> 02:05:32,060
No,
I did half of it on that and half on a 

3112
02:05:32,060 --> 02:05:32,060
road bike.
Um,

3113
02:05:32,060 --> 02:05:32,760
and then in the second half of it I 
didn't,

3114
02:05:32,820 --> 02:05:34,710
I just,
I did know drafting,

3115
02:05:34,711 --> 02:05:37,140
I just did a road bike with no drafting,
drafting.

3116
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:40,680
He was bitching about it and I just,
I was just like,

3117
02:05:40,681 --> 02:05:41,940
fuck it,
I don't need it.

3118
02:05:41,941 --> 02:05:43,010
Like it was bitching about,
uh,

3119
02:05:43,011 --> 02:05:45,630
while you were riding something like 
happens.

3120
02:05:46,010 --> 02:05:47,070
Oh yeah,
he was following me.

3121
02:05:47,071 --> 02:05:49,560
So I'm having arguments with them and I 
was just like,

3122
02:05:49,900 --> 02:05:54,900
it was helpful but it only helped on 
like flat,

3123
02:05:55,500 --> 02:05:57,340
like it.
So it doesn't help at all.

3124
02:05:57,341 --> 02:05:58,650
I'm uphill,
right.

3125
02:05:58,890 --> 02:06:00,360
So no uphill.
It helps.

3126
02:06:00,630 --> 02:06:05,630
And on the downhill I didn't need it 
because you're going so fucking fast 

3127
02:06:05,630 --> 02:06:07,610
that like you don't really want to be 
going more than like 30,

3128
02:06:07,630 --> 02:06:10,590
40 miles an hour and down hills because 
like if you hit shit in the road,

3129
02:06:10,591 --> 02:06:13,110
like you're and you crash,
like you're fucked.

3130
02:06:13,110 --> 02:06:14,250
You know what I mean?
Like if I crashed,

3131
02:06:14,251 --> 02:06:19,251
like I couldn't finish the thing.
So there's that and there's shit in the 

3132
02:06:19,251 --> 02:06:22,881
road.
I mean I'm almost like the side of a 

3133
02:06:22,881 --> 02:06:24,621
highway,
there's like tires and nails and you 

3134
02:06:24,621 --> 02:06:24,621
know what I mean,
like,

3135
02:06:24,621 --> 02:06:25,530
so you don't really want to be going 
like,

3136
02:06:25,570 --> 02:06:28,380
and I couldn't go on the highway because
I couldn't get the police escort for the

3137
02:06:28,381 --> 02:06:33,381
actual highway.
The CHP wouldn't do the highway portion 

3138
02:06:33,381 --> 02:06:33,381
of it.
Um,

3139
02:06:33,690 --> 02:06:35,250
so which,
which suck is,

3140
02:06:35,251 --> 02:06:40,251
that was like the most dangerous part.
So I was in the breakdown lane instead 

3141
02:06:40,251 --> 02:06:40,730
of like actually being in one of the 
lanes,

3142
02:06:40,731 --> 02:06:45,731
so there's just like,
there's just shit and the breakdown 

3143
02:06:45,731 --> 02:06:45,731
lanes,
you know,

3144
02:06:45,731 --> 02:06:46,660
just like fucking nails and whatever.
And you're doing it at night?

3145
02:06:46,980 --> 02:06:47,590
Yeah,
there was,

3146
02:06:47,591 --> 02:06:51,000
it was like pitch black sometimes we had
high winds.

3147
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:56,000
I mean it was gnarly.
It cut down to like 34 degrees at one 

3148
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:56,040
point.
Plus with the winds,

3149
02:06:56,041 --> 02:07:00,180
I mean I had a ski jacket on.
What you're thinking to yourself,

3150
02:07:00,181 --> 02:07:02,570
what the fuck am I doing?
A.

3151
02:07:02,700 --> 02:07:07,700
Yeah,
I mean I've had a lot of those moments 

3152
02:07:07,700 --> 02:07:08,730
in my life,
but I was more like thinking like I just

3153
02:07:08,731 --> 02:07:13,731
didn't know if I could do it.
I just didn't know like physically 

3154
02:07:13,731 --> 02:07:13,731
because I had just never done any 
biking.

3155
02:07:13,731 --> 02:07:17,841
I didn't know,
but my legs were just going to like not 

3156
02:07:17,841 --> 02:07:21,171
be able to go anymore.
I had no real experience in it so I 

3157
02:07:21,171 --> 02:07:22,490
didn't.
That was my real concern was just like I

3158
02:07:22,680 --> 02:07:24,810
knew mentally,
like I was just never going to quit.

3159
02:07:25,530 --> 02:07:30,530
I just didn't want to get injured or 
like just physically not be capable.

3160
02:07:30,571 --> 02:07:33,240
That was like my two concerns.
This is a video of you doing it this,

3161
02:07:33,241 --> 02:07:34,230
watch this,
look this,

3162
02:07:34,320 --> 02:07:36,090
look at these two cars.
They.

3163
02:07:36,220 --> 02:07:38,530
That was.
That was one fucking lane.

3164
02:07:38,560 --> 02:07:41,170
They just passed each other.
Yeah.

3165
02:07:41,171 --> 02:07:42,340
That was very close.

3166
02:07:45,980 --> 02:07:47,810
Thirty eight hours?
No,

3167
02:07:47,830 --> 02:07:50,600
30 to 32 hours.
So 48 hours is the bet.

3168
02:07:50,601 --> 02:07:53,750
And you did it in 32.
How pissed was when you won?

3169
02:07:54,280 --> 02:07:56,270
He actually treated it like a champ.
He didn't really give a shit.

3170
02:07:56,330 --> 02:07:58,620
It was pretty great.
It got a lot of money.

3171
02:07:58,820 --> 02:08:00,980
He's a baller.
He is for sure.

3172
02:08:01,610 --> 02:08:03,380
What does this.
Is this your house or my house?

3173
02:08:03,570 --> 02:08:08,570
Just went up on the bike for credit or 
are those the grinch?

3174
02:08:11,181 --> 02:08:12,680
The next day I was like green.
Fuck.

3175
02:08:13,010 --> 02:08:18,010
You said the most one is 51 million.
That was the most you've ever won 

3176
02:08:18,010 --> 02:08:18,080
before,
but not in one sitting.

3177
02:08:18,860 --> 02:08:22,370
That was over a course of eight,
nine months.

3178
02:08:22,400 --> 02:08:27,400
And that was just you going at it with 
this one dude and you guys playing one 

3179
02:08:27,400 --> 02:08:28,670
on one when you're doing shit like that.
Oh my God.

3180
02:08:29,240 --> 02:08:32,590
I remember there was one point where I 
was sitting there,

3181
02:08:32,610 --> 02:08:33,970
that's a Granola Bar,
ladies and gentlemen,

3182
02:08:34,010 --> 02:08:35,420
you know,
what the fuck is that sound?

3183
02:08:36,370 --> 02:08:41,370
And I checked my watch in a while,
so there was one point when at 18 

3184
02:08:41,370 --> 02:08:42,740
million bucks in front of me and he had 
me covered.

3185
02:08:42,741 --> 02:08:45,440
So if he said all I had to make a 
decision for 18 million bucks,

3186
02:08:45,470 --> 02:08:47,450
oh my God,
he's a billionaire.

3187
02:08:47,451 --> 02:08:52,451
He didn't give a fuck.
Eighteen dollars million on a hand in 

3188
02:08:52,451 --> 02:08:53,990
one hand up over.
What's the most you've ever had.

3189
02:08:53,991 --> 02:08:57,820
On one hand it was,

3190
02:09:05,090 --> 02:09:05,930
I think it was like

3191
02:09:07,550 --> 02:09:08,090
14,

3192
02:09:08,210 --> 02:09:10,370
10 million,
15 million bucks.

3193
02:09:10,820 --> 02:09:13,740
Obviously you had a buildup to this.
Like what?

3194
02:09:13,860 --> 02:09:17,540
At any point in time while you're 
gambling these ridiculous sums of money.

3195
02:09:17,541 --> 02:09:20,450
I mean this is not that long since you 
were broke.

3196
02:09:20,480 --> 02:09:23,660
I mean this is like you going from 
college to you doing this,

3197
02:09:23,810 --> 02:09:25,550
you know,
we're only talking about a decade or so.

3198
02:09:25,900 --> 02:09:26,920
Yeah.
Um,

3199
02:09:27,560 --> 02:09:29,630
that's fucking crazy.
Well,

3200
02:09:29,930 --> 02:09:32,360
there was periods of time when been 
over.

3201
02:09:33,350 --> 02:09:35,780
I've played with like almost my entire 
net worth on the day.

3202
02:09:35,920 --> 02:09:39,530
Will players do that kind of shit 
though?

3203
02:09:39,970 --> 02:09:41,560
Stressful.
That's crazy.

3204
02:09:41,650 --> 02:09:45,340
I've had my hair fall out before playing
just because you're too freaking out.

3205
02:09:46,010 --> 02:09:47,640
Shouldn't stress man,
you know,

3206
02:09:47,641 --> 02:09:52,641
like,
I mean there's just so many things that 

3207
02:09:52,641 --> 02:09:52,641
go into it.
Like you're,

3208
02:09:52,641 --> 02:09:53,230
you're,
you're not only thinking about like what

3209
02:09:53,231 --> 02:09:56,320
that person has,
but like what do they like?

3210
02:09:56,321 --> 02:09:58,300
What did they think that you think that 
they have?

3211
02:09:58,780 --> 02:10:03,780
Um,
I mean the basic step is what do you 

3212
02:10:03,780 --> 02:10:06,421
think that they think that you have and 
then like the range of hands that they 

3213
02:10:06,421 --> 02:10:07,930
could have.
Um,

3214
02:10:08,470 --> 02:10:09,880
why,
why,

3215
02:10:09,910 --> 02:10:12,340
why would he be betting this?
Why would he be calling here?

3216
02:10:12,341 --> 02:10:17,341
What type of hands could he have?
Like what are the probabilities that 

3217
02:10:17,341 --> 02:10:17,800
he's bluffing?
Like what is his mental state?

3218
02:10:18,490 --> 02:10:22,390
I mean like trying to pick up on telus.
There's just so many things that go into

3219
02:10:22,391 --> 02:10:25,360
it that you're,
you're so focused and it's so much money

3220
02:10:25,510 --> 02:10:28,510
and any little mistake that you make is 
going to cost you millions of dollars.

3221
02:10:28,510 --> 02:10:31,330
So it's like that.
That is like a lot.

3222
02:10:31,360 --> 02:10:34,610
And you're playing for sometimes 16,
17 hours.

3223
02:10:34,611 --> 02:10:39,611
Like you're just like delirious.
I remember one time while you're 

3224
02:10:39,611 --> 02:10:42,431
playing,
do you take like provigil or add 

3225
02:10:42,431 --> 02:10:44,890
adderall or anything?
I took adderall and it really fucked me 

3226
02:10:44,890 --> 02:10:47,771
up because I just like try to win every 
hand and it may be too aggressive and I 

3227
02:10:47,771 --> 02:10:49,250
just fucking plane crash into the 
mountain.

3228
02:10:49,251 --> 02:10:51,560
It was terrible.
So try that a couple times.

3229
02:10:51,620 --> 02:10:52,960
No good.
Um,

3230
02:10:54,080 --> 02:10:59,080
try weed and it fucking was terrible 
every time I was bluffing a little 

3231
02:10:59,080 --> 02:11:01,390
paranoid so I,
you know,

3232
02:11:01,430 --> 02:11:06,430
know.
And then sometimes I've taken like 

3233
02:11:06,430 --> 02:11:06,430
volume just so fucking relax,
you know,

3234
02:11:06,430 --> 02:11:07,820
because I'm just like strung out.
But then that makes you kind of not give

3235
02:11:07,821 --> 02:11:10,640
a fuck and so you do stupid shit.
It's.

3236
02:11:10,670 --> 02:11:12,530
Yeah,
you just almost got to be sober.

3237
02:11:12,560 --> 02:11:14,730
What about Beta blockers?
Um,

3238
02:11:14,750 --> 02:11:15,590
I never tried them.

3239
02:11:15,760 --> 02:11:20,760
I never tried to meet her,
but I saw this thing on concert 

3240
02:11:20,760 --> 02:11:24,810
performers,
like a penis or it was actually some 

3241
02:11:24,810 --> 02:11:25,510
people that playing in an orchestra.
They were talking about,

3242
02:11:25,540 --> 02:11:30,540
they took Beta blockers and it made a 
massive impact because they were super 

3243
02:11:30,540 --> 02:11:30,760
nervous about performing.
And I always thought about it.

3244
02:11:30,761 --> 02:11:31,390
I was like,
man,

3245
02:11:31,391 --> 02:11:36,391
that's a,
I guess it just stops you from getting 

3246
02:11:36,391 --> 02:11:38,971
nervous.
I would be really curious to see what 

3247
02:11:38,971 --> 02:11:38,971
that feels like.

3248
02:11:38,971 --> 02:11:38,971
Yeah.
Yeah.

3249
02:11:38,971 --> 02:11:38,971
No,
that'd be interesting.

3250
02:11:38,971 --> 02:11:39,720
I,
uh,

3251
02:11:41,010 --> 02:11:42,300
yeah,
I've definitely heard of that.

3252
02:11:42,301 --> 02:11:47,301
I think uh,
I think it's a big thing for actors and 

3253
02:11:47,301 --> 02:11:47,301
stuff like that with stage fright or 
whatever.

3254
02:11:47,301 --> 02:11:51,690
Sure.
At just don't know how long it lasts 

3255
02:11:51,690 --> 02:11:51,690
because like I said,
I mean these are,

3256
02:11:51,690 --> 02:11:55,011
you know,
you're talking about 18 hours sessions 

3257
02:11:55,011 --> 02:11:55,011
and it's just like.
And also you don't want anything to fuck

3258
02:11:55,011 --> 02:11:55,170
with your,
like mental acuity.

3259
02:11:55,480 --> 02:11:56,400
Yeah.
Um,

3260
02:11:56,430 --> 02:11:56,970
so

3261
02:11:57,510 --> 02:12:02,510
game.
Do you lead your study strategy and 

3262
02:12:02,510 --> 02:12:02,510
read,
read poker books?

3263
02:12:02,510 --> 02:12:02,510
And

3264
02:12:02,510 --> 02:12:03,030
I did,
I did,

3265
02:12:03,300 --> 02:12:08,300
I did back in the day,
but back in the day it wasn't quite as 

3266
02:12:08,300 --> 02:12:08,490
advanced.
Now they have so much stuff online where

3267
02:12:08,491 --> 02:12:13,491
you can basically watch these pros play.
And I'll give you an example.

3268
02:12:13,501 --> 02:12:15,610
Back when I was playing,
um,

3269
02:12:16,110 --> 02:12:20,610
I would play in college.
I played 10 tables at a time.

3270
02:12:20,611 --> 02:12:22,140
And you,
yeah,

3271
02:12:22,440 --> 02:12:24,210
and you would see about 100 hands an 
hour.

3272
02:12:24,450 --> 02:12:29,450
Um,
and let's say I just played for a 10 

3273
02:12:29,450 --> 02:12:31,551
hour session.
So you're playing 10 tables 

3274
02:12:31,551 --> 02:12:31,551
simultaneously.
How do you do that?

3275
02:12:31,551 --> 02:12:31,980
You have like 10 windows open up.
Yeah.

3276
02:12:32,160 --> 02:12:32,900
Wow.
Yes.

3277
02:12:32,910 --> 02:12:33,670
You're going click,
click,

3278
02:12:33,671 --> 02:12:34,100
click,
click.

3279
02:12:34,110 --> 02:12:39,110
All between all of them.
Many of sometimes you have multiple 

3280
02:12:39,110 --> 02:12:39,110
monitors set up.
Um,

3281
02:12:39,110 --> 02:12:43,580
and so basically in that period,
if you extrapolate that out,

3282
02:12:44,400 --> 02:12:45,120
that's,
you know,

3283
02:12:45,121 --> 02:12:47,820
you're seeing 10,000
hands right in that 10 hours of sessions

3284
02:12:47,821 --> 02:12:52,740
because 100 hands an hour per table 
times 10 times 10 times 100.

3285
02:12:53,060 --> 02:12:56,670
Um,
so if you plan a casino,

3286
02:12:56,850 --> 02:13:00,810
you're seeing about 20 hands an hour and
you're obviously only playing one table.

3287
02:13:01,020 --> 02:13:04,440
So that translates to 200 hands for that
day.

3288
02:13:04,680 --> 02:13:08,050
So have one one day playing online,
I've seen 10,000

3289
02:13:08,120 --> 02:13:09,080
hands,
one plant,

3290
02:13:09,120 --> 02:13:14,120
one day playing live have seen 200.
So you can imagine one day playing 

3291
02:13:14,120 --> 02:13:18,231
online,
I've seen more hands than a guy that's 

3292
02:13:18,231 --> 02:13:20,391
played in a casino for his entire life.
So just think about those numbers.

3293
02:13:20,791 --> 02:13:23,580
And so the thing is like when you're 
playing in casino.

3294
02:13:23,920 --> 02:13:25,080
Yeah,
exactly.

3295
02:13:25,280 --> 02:13:26,490
This picture,
who's that dude?

3296
02:13:26,550 --> 02:13:28,200
Lke,
what's his name?

3297
02:13:28,350 --> 02:13:29,700
Lke Elk.
Why?

3298
02:13:29,910 --> 02:13:31,800
That's his whole name.
Was He like Oprah?

3299
02:13:31,860 --> 02:13:34,370
I don't know.
He's,

3300
02:13:34,470 --> 02:13:37,170
I think he's a Swedish guy or something 
like that.

3301
02:13:37,171 --> 02:13:42,171
And so he's just,
he's got four giant monitors going on 

3302
02:13:42,171 --> 02:13:43,320
that like.
I mean these guys are say more tables.

3303
02:13:44,290 --> 02:13:45,960
That guy's got 12 on each side.

3304
02:13:46,200 --> 02:13:47,430
Yeah.
Wow.

3305
02:13:47,580 --> 02:13:49,620
So I mean this is what it's evolved to.
You know,

3306
02:13:49,621 --> 02:13:52,860
I was like one of the pioneers of this 
stuff because this guy got a fucking six

3307
02:13:52,861 --> 02:13:54,500
monitors here.
So when,

3308
02:13:54,570 --> 02:13:56,490
when you,
you can't do this in America anymore?

3309
02:13:56,491 --> 02:13:59,010
Correct.
Like it used to gamble online.

3310
02:13:59,100 --> 02:14:04,100
It's stopped.
I think a black pride or was in 2009.

3311
02:14:06,240 --> 02:14:07,860
Was it?
Fuck too.

3312
02:14:08,400 --> 02:14:09,680
Why not?
I mean,

3313
02:14:09,720 --> 02:14:12,540
why not?
Why can't my kids total bullshit?

3314
02:14:12,541 --> 02:14:13,830
I mean it's a game of skill.
Clearly.

3315
02:14:13,831 --> 02:14:16,350
I mean they allow the fantasy because 
it's a game of skill.

3316
02:14:16,770 --> 02:14:19,440
Um,
and yeah,

3317
02:14:19,510 --> 02:14:21,030
I just,
I think it's nonsense.

3318
02:14:21,031 --> 02:14:26,031
I don't really care because I wouldn't 
be playing online anymore because I 

3319
02:14:26,031 --> 02:14:27,690
can't compete with these kids.
They've just put too much time in it.

3320
02:14:27,691 --> 02:14:31,500
And the thing is now there's so much 
software that does so much for them.

3321
02:14:31,501 --> 02:14:36,501
Like for instance,
it'll tell you how many hands each 

3322
02:14:36,501 --> 02:14:37,890
person plays preflop,
how many,

3323
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,680
what percentage of the time they bet the
flop,

3324
02:14:40,920 --> 02:14:42,660
what percentage of the time they 
bluffed,

3325
02:14:42,870 --> 02:14:47,870
and they can just figure that out based 
on like how often they're going to have 

3326
02:14:47,870 --> 02:14:47,870
a hand in how often they bluff.

3327
02:14:47,870 --> 02:14:50,280
So to actually give you their bluff 
percentages on each street,

3328
02:14:50,281 --> 02:14:55,281
on the flop,
turn the river and it'll tell you like 

3329
02:14:55,281 --> 02:14:55,281
how,
how many times they're just like calling

3330
02:14:55,281 --> 02:15:00,141
bad.
Like it'll just give you all these 

3331
02:15:00,141 --> 02:15:02,451
stats.
So it's almost more turned into like a 

3332
02:15:02,451 --> 02:15:04,581
mathematical computer game.
Whereas I liked the more pure form of 

3333
02:15:04,581 --> 02:15:05,130
just like I'm looking the guy in the 
fucking.

3334
02:15:05,131 --> 02:15:07,560
I'm just trying to figure out what he's 
got.

3335
02:15:07,561 --> 02:15:08,130
And you know,
you're.

3336
02:15:08,350 --> 02:15:10,530
And you're also playing the player.
Like when you're playing live,

3337
02:15:10,531 --> 02:15:12,360
like you know,
for me,

3338
02:15:12,361 --> 02:15:14,970
I can calculate how much money a guy has
very fast.

3339
02:15:15,210 --> 02:15:18,330
I can figure out like his comfort level 
with bluffing.

3340
02:15:18,331 --> 02:15:21,390
I can figure out the type of guy he is.
Whether or not he's aggressive,

3341
02:15:21,391 --> 02:15:24,480
whether or not he's the type of guy that
when he's winning,

3342
02:15:24,481 --> 02:15:26,740
he's gonna want to lock it up or the 
type of guy that when he's winning,

3343
02:15:26,750 --> 02:15:28,050
he's want to gamble more.

3344
02:15:28,290 --> 02:15:33,290
The type of guy that when he's losing is
going to kind of play a lot more hands 

3345
02:15:33,290 --> 02:15:36,381
and try and get even,
or the type of guy that going to just 

3346
02:15:36,381 --> 02:15:39,260
try and wait for a big hand.
The type of guy that's going to be just 

3347
02:15:39,260 --> 02:15:39,260
calling his money,
chasing,

3348
02:15:39,260 --> 02:15:40,430
trying to get lucky.
That kind of got,

3349
02:15:40,431 --> 02:15:42,360
that's going to be pushing the action 
and betting a lot.

3350
02:15:42,390 --> 02:15:45,480
Like there's just so many things that go
into it that,

3351
02:15:45,810 --> 02:15:47,220
you know,
I like to just,

3352
02:15:47,250 --> 02:15:48,480
you know,
play live.

3353
02:15:48,481 --> 02:15:50,400
And I like talk to people and I liked 
it.

3354
02:15:50,401 --> 02:15:52,380
You know,
have that human interaction.

3355
02:15:52,381 --> 02:15:54,480
There's a lot of these guys that are 
really good behind a computer,

3356
02:15:54,481 --> 02:15:55,830
but you put them in front of another 
guy.

3357
02:15:55,831 --> 02:15:58,510
You can't look at man in the eye and 
just fucking blow up.

3358
02:15:58,511 --> 02:15:59,650
You'd just like crumble,
you know,

3359
02:15:59,651 --> 02:16:00,630
so,
so online.

3360
02:16:00,630 --> 02:16:03,390
They can click that button and say all 
in and do these crazy bluffs,

3361
02:16:03,391 --> 02:16:08,391
but you know,
they just physically can't push those 

3362
02:16:08,391 --> 02:16:08,430
chips in and keep a straight face on a 
table.

3363
02:16:08,700 --> 02:16:11,790
So you know,
there's something going on when you're,

3364
02:16:11,791 --> 02:16:13,350
when you're looking at them,
there's like,

3365
02:16:13,380 --> 02:16:14,890
there's a certain amount of weeks.
I,

3366
02:16:14,950 --> 02:16:16,320
like I said,
I've never played poker.

3367
02:16:16,440 --> 02:16:21,440
So there,
there is a certain amount of intuition 

3368
02:16:21,440 --> 02:16:21,440
and instinct.
Yeah.

3369
02:16:21,440 --> 02:16:21,440
Uh,
it definitely is.

3370
02:16:21,440 --> 02:16:23,100
It's not like in the movies where it's 
like,

3371
02:16:23,130 --> 02:16:28,130
oh,
like I picked up a tail on this guy and 

3372
02:16:28,130 --> 02:16:28,130
every time he bluffs he twitches or you 
know what I mean?

3373
02:16:28,130 --> 02:16:30,070
Like,
like that's a rare thing.

3374
02:16:30,370 --> 02:16:35,370
It's more,
it's more just like understanding the 

3375
02:16:35,370 --> 02:16:37,921
person.
It's like you figure out what kind of 

3376
02:16:37,921 --> 02:16:37,921
job this guy does,
like how much money he makes a year.

3377
02:16:37,921 --> 02:16:40,030
Like how much this money means to them,
how much he cares about the money,

3378
02:16:40,031 --> 02:16:42,760
how much he wants to gamble,
how much he's playing for fun,

3379
02:16:42,761 --> 02:16:44,920
how much he wants to win.
Some of these guys,

3380
02:16:44,921 --> 02:16:46,420
they just,
they actually want to lose their,

3381
02:16:46,421 --> 02:16:48,240
just like self sabotagers,
you know,

3382
02:16:48,250 --> 02:16:53,250
they'll go in there and like some of 
them I'll see them and they'll want to 

3383
02:16:53,250 --> 02:16:54,760
lose because they'll want everybody at 
the table like them.

3384
02:16:54,761 --> 02:16:56,460
And that's kind of like,
you know,

3385
02:16:56,530 --> 02:16:57,830
the path of least resistance.

3386
02:17:00,100 --> 02:17:05,100
How do you detect that?
Like how do you detect that a guy wants 

3387
02:17:05,100 --> 02:17:05,100
to lose,
he'll be,

3388
02:17:05,100 --> 02:17:05,380
you know,
he'll be just like wanting to be friends

3389
02:17:05,381 --> 02:17:07,650
with everybody and he'll do shit to show
off or to like,

3390
02:17:07,660 --> 02:17:08,170
you know,
make.

3391
02:17:08,230 --> 02:17:09,730
Because I mean look at the end of the 
day,

3392
02:17:09,731 --> 02:17:11,530
like people want people to play bad,
right?

3393
02:17:11,531 --> 02:17:16,531
Like you want a player to play like shit
you want to play or to give his money 

3394
02:17:16,531 --> 02:17:16,531
away.
You want to play or to,

3395
02:17:16,531 --> 02:17:16,531
you know,
uh,

3396
02:17:16,531 --> 02:17:17,380
you know,
do crazy stuff.

3397
02:17:17,381 --> 02:17:22,381
So these guys will know.
They'll put on a show for people that 

3398
02:17:22,381 --> 02:17:22,540
want to be the popular guy.
Maybe they weren't cool in high school.

3399
02:17:22,541 --> 02:17:25,240
Maybe they want people like them who 
knows what their reason is.

3400
02:17:25,241 --> 02:17:26,920
Maybe they feel like they don't deserve 
the money.

3401
02:17:26,921 --> 02:17:29,050
I'll play with a lot of guys that,
you know,

3402
02:17:29,080 --> 02:17:31,780
some of them ended up in jail,
some of them are fraud somewhere cheat.

3403
02:17:31,780 --> 02:17:32,500
Some of these guys,
you know,

3404
02:17:32,501 --> 02:17:37,501
they have a bunch of money and they feel
like they don't deserve it 

3405
02:17:37,501 --> 02:17:37,501
subconsciously,
so they'll just want to give it away.

3406
02:17:37,501 --> 02:17:41,431
It's just the thing that's interesting.
And do you see a lot of guys who just 

3407
02:17:41,431 --> 02:17:43,810
lose everything?
I've seen it before.

3408
02:17:43,811 --> 02:17:46,150
Yeah.
I've seen guys go completely broke.

3409
02:17:46,750 --> 02:17:51,750
It's tough because in gambling you can 
just keep going up but you can't really 

3410
02:17:52,571 --> 02:17:54,460
go down.
It's like for instance,

3411
02:17:54,461 --> 02:17:59,461
if you go and you play blackjack and you
bet whatever arbitrary number of $500 a 

3412
02:17:59,981 --> 02:18:00,640
hand.
Right?

3413
02:18:00,700 --> 02:18:02,610
And you were playing 500 bucks at hand 
and you know,

3414
02:18:02,620 --> 02:18:07,620
your level of excitement when you win is
at a seven and you keep playing and 

3415
02:18:07,620 --> 02:18:10,720
whatever and then now you go and play a 
thousand bucks a hand and even winning a

3416
02:18:10,721 --> 02:18:12,280
little bit or you've been losing or 
whatever.

3417
02:18:12,670 --> 02:18:16,330
And now if you try and go back to $500 
to 50,

3418
02:18:16,331 --> 02:18:17,500
it's just like,
you know,

3419
02:18:17,690 --> 02:18:19,510
if you're losing,
it's just like it's,

3420
02:18:19,540 --> 02:18:24,540
it's a mental fuck because it's really 
hard to get even betting smaller and if 

3421
02:18:24,540 --> 02:18:27,430
you've been winning you don't really 
care about the small money.

3422
02:18:27,430 --> 02:18:28,260
Right.
Like you want to,

3423
02:18:28,660 --> 02:18:30,700
you know what I'm saying?
It's like one of those things where like

3424
02:18:31,120 --> 02:18:34,120
once you go up it's really hard to go 
the other direction.

3425
02:18:34,121 --> 02:18:39,121
So a lot of,
a lot of the problems that professional 

3426
02:18:39,121 --> 02:18:39,400
poker players have,
it's called bankroll management,

3427
02:18:39,401 --> 02:18:43,850
where they keep going up and up and up.
And then when they start losing they,

3428
02:18:43,870 --> 02:18:48,490
they are completely unable to drop down 
and steaks and then play good.

3429
02:18:48,790 --> 02:18:52,330
You know,
like if they lost let's say $100,000

3430
02:18:52,331 --> 02:18:54,620
just to use round numbers at,
you know,

3431
02:18:54,880 --> 02:18:59,880
this game.
Then for them to go to play a game 

3432
02:18:59,880 --> 02:19:01,090
that's half that size and try and win 
that hundred $100,000

3433
02:19:01,091 --> 02:19:06,091
back,
it's going to take them twice as much 

3434
02:19:06,091 --> 02:19:06,091
time.
You know what I mean?

3435
02:19:06,091 --> 02:19:06,091
So it's kind of like one of those things
where,

3436
02:19:06,091 --> 02:19:11,080
you know,
in the games have gotten bigger and 

3437
02:19:11,080 --> 02:19:11,080
bigger and bigger,
so somebody goes on a bad run,

3438
02:19:11,080 --> 02:19:12,910
like,
and poker is their profession.

3439
02:19:12,910 --> 02:19:14,070
It's not like,
you know,

3440
02:19:14,320 --> 02:19:19,320
that's,
that's another thing that people don't 

3441
02:19:19,320 --> 02:19:19,320
understand.
It's like,

3442
02:19:19,320 --> 02:19:19,320
you know,
people,

3443
02:19:19,320 --> 02:19:19,320
people are like,
oh,

3444
02:19:19,320 --> 02:19:19,320
you're winning.
Like you should,

3445
02:19:19,320 --> 02:19:20,710
you should take the money and run.
It's like,

3446
02:19:20,711 --> 02:19:22,390
no,
like when you play poker for a living,

3447
02:19:22,391 --> 02:19:25,540
like it never ends.
Like there it's like yeah,

3448
02:19:25,541 --> 02:19:29,420
there may be session to session but like
you're always going to be playing poker.

3449
02:19:29,421 --> 02:19:33,080
So it's like if that's a good spot you 
should just play until the game's over.

3450
02:19:33,081 --> 02:19:35,480
Like even if you want,
it's not like blackjack where you should

3451
02:19:35,481 --> 02:19:40,481
just lock up a when like in poker you 
just stay there and in fact the more 

3452
02:19:40,481 --> 02:19:41,150
you're winning,
the more other people are losing and the

3453
02:19:41,151 --> 02:19:43,280
more other people are losing the worst 
they're going to play.

3454
02:19:43,550 --> 02:19:45,470
So it's Kinda like one of those things 
where you just,

3455
02:19:45,760 --> 02:19:47,900
you know,
it's just one long session.

3456
02:19:47,920 --> 02:19:49,090
It never ends.
You know

3457
02:19:49,260 --> 02:19:52,770
how pissed too people get when they lose
fuck tons of money.

3458
02:19:52,771 --> 02:19:56,910
If you ever had issues with that where 
people get violent or people were angry.

3459
02:19:57,230 --> 02:19:59,780
Definitely angry.
And it's funny because,

3460
02:19:59,810 --> 02:20:01,580
and I,
and I'm a victim of this too,

3461
02:20:01,581 --> 02:20:06,581
like I've found sometimes I've gotten 
far more angry at losing $20,000.

3462
02:20:07,671 --> 02:20:11,270
Then I have at losing $500,000.
A strange as that may sound.

3463
02:20:11,670 --> 02:20:13,430
I'm just because

3464
02:20:14,200 --> 02:20:19,200
you know,
of the way I lost it or if I played 

3465
02:20:19,200 --> 02:20:19,780
shitty or if I lost it to a guide in 
like,

3466
02:20:19,781 --> 02:20:21,460
or it was just like I lost,
lost,

3467
02:20:21,461 --> 02:20:22,150
lost,
lost,

3468
02:20:22,151 --> 02:20:24,460
and just like a steady progression of 
losses.

3469
02:20:24,970 --> 02:20:29,970
Or if I was up a ton of money and then 
like let's say I was up a million 

3470
02:20:29,970 --> 02:20:34,050
dollars and ended up losing $20,000.
Like I'd be fucking miserable even 

3471
02:20:34,050 --> 02:20:38,221
though I only lost 20 grand.
But let's say I was down a million 

3472
02:20:38,221 --> 02:20:40,720
dollars and I ended up losing $20,000.
I'd be ecstatic.

3473
02:20:41,350 --> 02:20:43,900
Now look at the end result was one night
I,

3474
02:20:43,901 --> 02:20:44,590
I

3475
02:20:44,650 --> 02:20:49,650
one slash 20 grand and I was miserable 
and the other night I lost 20 grand and 

3476
02:20:49,650 --> 02:20:49,880
I was happy,
right?

3477
02:20:50,200 --> 02:20:54,970
Because I started off up a million and 
then last ended up being a $20,000

3478
02:20:55,000 --> 02:21:00,000
winner.
Like that seems like a million dollar 

3479
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:00,250
loss to me because at one point in that 
game I was up a million bucks,

3480
02:21:00,251 --> 02:21:01,750
right?
So mentally,

3481
02:21:01,990 --> 02:21:06,990
you know,
I kinda like in my mind I've lost a 

3482
02:21:06,990 --> 02:21:10,170
million dollars.
And then in the other game I was down a 

3483
02:21:10,170 --> 02:21:10,170
million and then ended up only losing 
$20,000,

3484
02:21:10,170 --> 02:21:11,590
so almost broke even.
So I'm like ecstatic,

3485
02:21:11,620 --> 02:21:12,720
you know what I'm saying?
So there's

3486
02:21:13,950 --> 02:21:18,950
also something that you were just 
talking about that I think is really 

3487
02:21:18,950 --> 02:21:19,710
interesting because it kind of parallels
a martial arts and fighting and a lot of

3488
02:21:19,711 --> 02:21:22,230
ways is that you don't want to lose 
someone that you hate.

3489
02:21:22,560 --> 02:21:23,460
Yup.
Yeah.

3490
02:21:23,470 --> 02:21:25,200
And that's a big factor.
And fighting.

3491
02:21:25,201 --> 02:21:30,201
That's why conor mcgregor does so well 
is that he fucks with your head so bad 

3492
02:21:30,201 --> 02:21:34,401
that the amount of pressure that's on 
you is so exacerbated when you actually 

3493
02:21:34,401 --> 02:21:35,970
get into the cage with them.
Like even guys like Josie,

3494
02:21:35,971 --> 02:21:40,971
although who's this seasoned world 
champion who never lost in the UFC,

3495
02:21:41,850 --> 02:21:45,690
hey connor just mind fucked him and he 
can punch.

3496
02:21:45,720 --> 02:21:47,040
I mean it's,
it's both things.

3497
02:21:47,041 --> 02:21:52,041
He's got skill and he's really good at 
handling pressure and he's the mindfuck 

3498
02:21:52,140 --> 02:21:57,140
master,
but you see it with guys when guys get 

3499
02:21:57,140 --> 02:22:00,471
in these emotional situations with 
fighters and then you see when they 

3500
02:22:00,471 --> 02:22:01,860
fight with someone who respects them and
shake hands the weigh ins and they could

3501
02:22:01,861 --> 02:22:06,861
fight up to their full potential.
I that that is a big factor I guess in 

3502
02:22:06,861 --> 02:22:07,830
poker as well.
Yeah,

3503
02:22:08,730 --> 02:22:10,170
definitely.
I mean there's,

3504
02:22:10,230 --> 02:22:15,230
I've seen tons of times when somebody 
really hates another player and in fact 

3505
02:22:15,230 --> 02:22:20,121
like has just played far worse against 
that guy and given that guy so much 

3506
02:22:20,731 --> 02:22:22,100
money because they,
they,

3507
02:22:22,101 --> 02:22:24,070
they kept going after him.
You know,

3508
02:22:24,071 --> 02:22:25,770
like they really wanted bluff them.

3509
02:22:26,130 --> 02:22:27,630
They're like,
fuck this motherfucker.

3510
02:22:27,631 --> 02:22:32,631
I'm not going to let this guy blocked me
and then they ended up just paying them 

3511
02:22:32,631 --> 02:22:32,631
off and paying them off and paying them 
off.

3512
02:22:32,631 --> 02:22:36,600
I actually found that in poker because 
there was times when I'd be friend,

3513
02:22:36,601 --> 02:22:40,650
really bad players and then that player 
would not play hard against me,

3514
02:22:41,010 --> 02:22:42,150
you know,
because of that.

3515
02:22:42,151 --> 02:22:47,151
And it actually ended up costing me a 
bunch of money and then there's other 

3516
02:22:47,151 --> 02:22:49,761
times when I would just like talk shit 
to a bad player and they would really 

3517
02:22:49,761 --> 02:22:50,760
come after me and then I'm just smoking 
them,

3518
02:22:51,170 --> 02:22:52,440
you know?
So it's Kinda like,

3519
02:22:52,770 --> 02:22:57,770
it's tough because usually the bad 
players were the coolest guys because 

3520
02:22:57,770 --> 02:23:00,981
they're just like the rich guys that are
having fun and they got a good attitude 

3521
02:23:00,981 --> 02:23:01,780
and this and that.
But sometimes you know,

3522
02:23:01,790 --> 02:23:03,480
like you gotta fuck with them a little 
bit,

3523
02:23:03,550 --> 02:23:08,550
you know,
cause otherwise you're not going to be 

3524
02:23:08,550 --> 02:23:08,550
able to gamble with them really.

3525
02:23:08,550 --> 02:23:08,550
You know.
So you want that.

3526
02:23:08,550 --> 02:23:13,071
Like you want that kind of like,
optimally you want that competitive but 

3527
02:23:13,951 --> 02:23:17,430
semi friendly relationship because you 
don't want them to just totally hate you

3528
02:23:17,431 --> 02:23:19,110
because then you'd be like,
fuck this motherfucker,

3529
02:23:19,170 --> 02:23:24,170
I'm not playing if he's there and then 
you're kinda like out of the game 

3530
02:23:24,170 --> 02:23:24,720
because he's the big sucker and he can 
call the shots,

3531
02:23:25,020 --> 02:23:28,610
which just seems like such a 
psychological management thing with,

3532
02:23:28,650 --> 02:23:30,330
with poker players.
There's a lot,

3533
02:23:30,331 --> 02:23:31,590
man.
It's a real,

3534
02:23:31,591 --> 02:23:34,560
it seems on the surface like an easy 
thing to do.

3535
02:23:34,650 --> 02:23:37,410
No it doesn't.
But I feel like for a lot of people they

3536
02:23:37,411 --> 02:23:38,460
look at it and they're just like,
oh,

3537
02:23:38,461 --> 02:23:41,400
he gambles for a living.
Like he got lucky or he's just like good

3538
02:23:41,401 --> 02:23:42,190
with numbers.
You know?

3539
02:23:42,290 --> 02:23:47,290
They've break it down so simplistically 
that they don't realize like how 

3540
02:23:47,290 --> 02:23:47,290
difficult it is.

3541
02:23:47,290 --> 02:23:52,160
But isn't that the case with everything?
I mean I've heard people say that about 

3542
02:23:52,160 --> 02:23:52,160
Nascar,
like Oh,

3543
02:23:52,160 --> 02:23:53,880
they'll just turn left.
Like No.

3544
02:23:54,660 --> 02:23:55,660
Well Nascar's,
I would,

3545
02:23:55,690 --> 02:24:00,690
I would come.
I think that the closest comparison is 

3546
02:24:00,690 --> 02:24:00,690
with the stock bark,
like stockbrokers,

3547
02:24:00,690 --> 02:24:01,410
stock market stuff,
you know,

3548
02:24:01,411 --> 02:24:06,411
because they're really gambling.
I mean at the end of the day that that 

3549
02:24:06,411 --> 02:24:06,780
is kind of gambling and you know,
and they're going to have losses.

3550
02:24:07,080 --> 02:24:07,480
The,
the,

3551
02:24:07,550 --> 02:24:09,960
the parallel there is that you can go 
into work,

3552
02:24:10,170 --> 02:24:13,380
you can fucking do a good job,
bust your ass to everything,

3553
02:24:13,381 --> 02:24:18,381
right,
and then just get fucked because of bad 

3554
02:24:18,381 --> 02:24:18,381
luck.
That can happen to a doctor.

3555
02:24:18,381 --> 02:24:19,170
Really.
You know what I'm saying?

3556
02:24:19,171 --> 02:24:21,330
Like that can't happen with most 
professions.

3557
02:24:21,331 --> 02:24:23,970
Like even in fighting,
like even the loser gets paid,

3558
02:24:23,971 --> 02:24:26,130
right?
You don't go into a fight and lose money

3559
02:24:26,131 --> 02:24:27,030
if you lose,
right?

3560
02:24:27,030 --> 02:24:30,600
Like poker and the stock market or some 
of the few things that like,

3561
02:24:30,601 --> 02:24:34,680
it's kind of hard to really have that 
good bankroll management because you can

3562
02:24:34,681 --> 02:24:36,030
go into everything,
right?

3563
02:24:36,031 --> 02:24:39,480
Bust your ass and work for an entire 
month and lose money.

3564
02:24:39,750 --> 02:24:43,320
But that is where the thrill lies to the
common man,

3565
02:24:43,340 --> 02:24:43,720
the,
the,

3566
02:24:43,740 --> 02:24:48,740
the average person that plays it safe 
and takes it easy and gets his 401k and 

3567
02:24:48,740 --> 02:24:49,680
doesn't,
doesn't do anything risky.

3568
02:24:50,070 --> 02:24:52,260
That's where the thrill lies and that 
lifestyle,

3569
02:24:52,261 --> 02:24:55,410
like talking to you and hearing you talk
about this shit,

3570
02:24:55,680 --> 02:25:00,680
that's where people that are getting 
their palms are sweaty right now when 

3571
02:25:00,680 --> 02:25:00,900
they're driving to work and they listen 
to this and thinking,

3572
02:25:00,901 --> 02:25:02,280
could I do that?
Could I do that?

3573
02:25:02,310 --> 02:25:03,780
Could I do that?
Most people can't.

3574
02:25:03,810 --> 02:25:04,970
Most people cannot.
It's,

3575
02:25:04,980 --> 02:25:06,210
I mean it's,
it's,

3576
02:25:06,940 --> 02:25:11,940
it's one of the hardest things I've done
and I've done a lot of hard things just 

3577
02:25:11,971 --> 02:25:16,971
because for me doing,
doing physically hard things actually 

3578
02:25:16,971 --> 02:25:19,920
isn't like as challenging as mentally 
tough things.

3579
02:25:20,040 --> 02:25:25,040
Um,
if that makes any sense because the 

3580
02:25:25,040 --> 02:25:25,720
physical stuff fit the physically tough 
stuff.

3581
02:25:25,721 --> 02:25:30,721
You just kind of like sparking bite your
tongue and grit and fucking take the 

3582
02:25:30,721 --> 02:25:34,651
pain and just power through like,
well that's got to be one of the 

3583
02:25:34,651 --> 02:25:35,530
benefits of going through buds twice.
Yeah,

3584
02:25:35,531 --> 02:25:38,300
I mean it puts it in perspective.
Yeah.

3585
02:25:38,340 --> 02:25:39,460
I mean just,
you know,

3586
02:25:39,520 --> 02:25:44,520
you've been through way more of a 
hellacious physical test than most 

3587
02:25:44,520 --> 02:25:45,820
people could ever endure.
Yeah.

3588
02:25:45,821 --> 02:25:47,710
I mean,
I think a lot of it comes down to,

3589
02:25:47,711 --> 02:25:48,880
you know,
a lot of people are like,

3590
02:25:48,910 --> 02:25:49,450
oh,
like,

3591
02:25:49,720 --> 02:25:54,720
you know,
you must be a super tough motherfucker 

3592
02:25:54,720 --> 02:25:56,641
and all this other shit.
And I think it comes down more to just 

3593
02:25:56,641 --> 02:25:58,030
like how bad you want it.
Like in life,

3594
02:25:58,031 --> 02:26:00,460
like if you just want something so 
fucking bad.

3595
02:26:00,461 --> 02:26:05,461
Like I just remembered like when I was 
doing the 50 meter underwater swim is 

3596
02:26:05,461 --> 02:26:05,461
really hard for me.

3597
02:26:05,461 --> 02:26:07,270
I'd never been able to do it.
Um,

3598
02:26:07,330 --> 02:26:08,510
outside of,
you know,

3599
02:26:08,590 --> 02:26:13,590
seal training and the only two times I 
did it was when I had to do it and I 

3600
02:26:13,590 --> 02:26:13,630
just remembered,
I was just like,

3601
02:26:13,631 --> 02:26:16,600
well I'm just going to swim until I 
fucking reached the wall or blackout.

3602
02:26:16,601 --> 02:26:19,270
Like there just wasn't another option.
Like I was just like,

3603
02:26:19,271 --> 02:26:21,880
I just wasn't going to quit just because
I wanted it so bad.

3604
02:26:22,390 --> 02:26:27,390
So that actually helps you.
I remember there's one guy that that 

3605
02:26:27,390 --> 02:26:30,610
went into buds and he was um,
he had like a million dollar business.

3606
02:26:30,611 --> 02:26:35,611
I think it was,
I think it was the guy that owned van 

3607
02:26:35,611 --> 02:26:38,131
Dutch or something maybe,
or had some affiliation with that and I 

3608
02:26:38,131 --> 02:26:38,131
just remember he went into buds after 
that.

3609
02:26:38,131 --> 02:26:42,600
I just remember he showed up and he had 
like a hot chick or two hot chicks and 

3610
02:26:42,600 --> 02:26:42,910
it,
a sports car and everybody's like,

3611
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:44,470
fuck,
he's a stud.

3612
02:26:44,470 --> 02:26:45,920
You know what I mean?
Like it was like,

3613
02:26:46,210 --> 02:26:49,780
and then he like showed up a buds and 
ended up quitting like straight away.

3614
02:26:49,781 --> 02:26:54,781
And I was just like,
but it didn't surprise me because I'm 

3615
02:26:54,781 --> 02:26:54,781
like thinking,
you know,

3616
02:26:54,781 --> 02:26:55,090
if,
if,

3617
02:26:55,120 --> 02:26:57,640
you know,
if I don't make it I'm going to ship and

3618
02:26:57,641 --> 02:27:00,220
I'm going to be fucking miserable.
Like I don't want that.

3619
02:27:00,490 --> 02:27:05,490
Like this guy's thinking like if I quit 
I can go like fuck a bunch of girls and 

3620
02:27:05,490 --> 02:27:07,150
like drive nice cars.
And I got money.

3621
02:27:07,151 --> 02:27:07,930
Like,
you know what I'm saying?

3622
02:27:07,931 --> 02:27:10,780
So like for him it was like,
I actually think it's harder,

3623
02:27:11,170 --> 02:27:12,100
you know,
like,

3624
02:27:12,101 --> 02:27:15,610
because you look at like,
you know what your alternatives are,

3625
02:27:15,611 --> 02:27:15,980
you know,
like,

3626
02:27:16,150 --> 02:27:17,100
like,
you know,

3627
02:27:17,110 --> 02:27:22,110
if you,
if you put a fucking guy up against the 

3628
02:27:22,110 --> 02:27:24,121
wall and he's got no choice,
then he's just going to like do what 

3629
02:27:24,121 --> 02:27:24,121
he's gotta do.

3630
02:27:24,121 --> 02:27:25,570
Like for instance if I told you you had 
to go crawl,

3631
02:27:25,840 --> 02:27:30,840
you know,
50 miles or I'm going to fucking put a 

3632
02:27:30,840 --> 02:27:34,651
bullet in your head,
like you're probably going to go crawl 

3633
02:27:34,651 --> 02:27:34,651
that 50 miles.
But,

3634
02:27:34,651 --> 02:27:34,651
but I told you,
hey,

3635
02:27:34,651 --> 02:27:37,690
like I'm going to give you $500,000,
you know,

3636
02:27:37,691 --> 02:27:39,820
if you can go crawl these 50 miles,
but you know,

3637
02:27:39,821 --> 02:27:41,710
you got money and you don't really need 
it,

3638
02:27:41,920 --> 02:27:43,680
you're probably not going to crawl 50 
miles.

3639
02:27:43,720 --> 02:27:48,720
You know what I'm saying?
Like it's Kinda like one of those 

3640
02:27:48,720 --> 02:27:50,641
things.
It's just like the alternative is what 

3641
02:27:50,641 --> 02:27:53,370
determines the difficulty.
It was a great scene and officer and a 

3642
02:27:53,370 --> 02:27:55,720
gentleman remember what your gear.
I don't know.

3643
02:27:55,780 --> 02:27:56,800
Yeah,
I remember that.

3644
02:27:56,860 --> 02:27:57,820
Yeah,
I do remember that.

3645
02:27:57,821 --> 02:27:59,890
And that's exactly it.
I got nowhere else to go.

3646
02:27:59,960 --> 02:28:02,740
That's one thing I tell people when 
they're thinking about fighting,

3647
02:28:03,070 --> 02:28:04,540
I say,
is it all you want to do?

3648
02:28:04,710 --> 02:28:05,890
Is it.
Is it your whole life?

3649
02:28:05,910 --> 02:28:07,630
Does it absorb you?
Does it do?

3650
02:28:07,631 --> 02:28:10,240
Do you want that more than anything that
you can imagine?

3651
02:28:10,241 --> 02:28:11,320
It's not like,
well,

3652
02:28:11,321 --> 02:28:16,321
fighting doesn't work out.
I'm going to be an author it because if 

3653
02:28:16,321 --> 02:28:16,420
that's the case and you want to do it 
for the experience,

3654
02:28:16,421 --> 02:28:21,421
that's cool,
but if you actually think you're going 

3655
02:28:21,421 --> 02:28:23,671
to be a champion,
if you have all these other escape 

3656
02:28:23,671 --> 02:28:23,671
routes and it's

3657
02:28:23,671 --> 02:28:27,070
not going to happen.
That's why I actually think it's harder 

3658
02:28:27,070 --> 02:28:29,231
for guys like conor mcgregor or guys 
like mayweather because now they have 

3659
02:28:29,231 --> 02:28:29,930
money and they have that lifestyle and 
it's like that.

3660
02:28:29,931 --> 02:28:34,931
I actually thought Rhonda was going to 
get fucked up just because she likes 

3661
02:28:34,931 --> 02:28:34,931
she,
you know,

3662
02:28:34,931 --> 02:28:35,180
she was going to Hollywood.
I mean,

3663
02:28:35,240 --> 02:28:36,350
don't get me wrong,
she's tough,

3664
02:28:36,351 --> 02:28:37,550
she's fucking great,
whatever,

3665
02:28:37,820 --> 02:28:42,820
but you know,
she was like doing the movies and she's 

3666
02:28:42,820 --> 02:28:45,641
doing this and it's like I just,
I know that lifestyle and I know the 

3667
02:28:45,641 --> 02:28:49,751
addictiveness of the money and the fame 
and all that other stuff and now it's 

3668
02:28:49,751 --> 02:28:49,751
like these people that have been 
fucking,

3669
02:28:49,751 --> 02:28:54,251
you know,
living in a one bedroom apartment are 

3670
02:28:54,251 --> 02:28:55,550
now introduced to all this money and all
this fame and people and it's just,

3671
02:28:55,580 --> 02:28:58,130
it's so distracting as opposed to the 
guy that's like,

3672
02:28:58,400 --> 02:29:03,400
you know,
fucking waking up everyday and going to 

3673
02:29:03,400 --> 02:29:03,530
the gym and fucking busting his ass and 
just trying to make ends meet and that's

3674
02:29:03,531 --> 02:29:06,470
all he's got and he's got no fucking 
nowhere else to go.

3675
02:29:06,470 --> 02:29:07,210
Like you said,
you know.

3676
02:29:07,460 --> 02:29:09,230
And,
and for that guy,

3677
02:29:09,231 --> 02:29:12,460
I feel like it's far easier to stay the 
course for garlic,

3678
02:29:12,470 --> 02:29:14,660
conor mcgregor.
Now he's got all this money and this and

3679
02:29:14,661 --> 02:29:15,680
that,
you know,

3680
02:29:15,830 --> 02:29:16,610
he's,
you know,

3681
02:29:16,640 --> 02:29:19,940
he doesn't have to fight anymore.
Like like I mean,

3682
02:29:19,941 --> 02:29:24,941
yeah,
he like if he wants to continue his 

3683
02:29:24,941 --> 02:29:26,561
lifestyle,
he does right now he's like up as 

3684
02:29:26,561 --> 02:29:28,751
expenses in his image and all this stuff
and he's used to all this stuff and now 

3685
02:29:28,751 --> 02:29:30,020
he has to make x to maintain his current
situation.

3686
02:29:30,260 --> 02:29:32,810
So he's got a little bit of pressure on 
them in that sense,

3687
02:29:33,050 --> 02:29:35,720
but he's not,
he's not struggling.

3688
02:29:35,721 --> 02:29:37,250
He's not hungry anymore.
You know what I mean?

3689
02:29:37,251 --> 02:29:39,110
He's got the pencil on who you are 
though.

3690
02:29:39,170 --> 02:29:41,000
I mean everybody has a different 
motivation.

3691
02:29:41,001 --> 02:29:46,001
Some people,
it's not even like they changed the 

3692
02:29:46,001 --> 02:29:46,460
goalposts instead of becoming rich.

3693
02:29:46,580 --> 02:29:51,580
It's become the greatest of all time.
It's like you look at all these other 

3694
02:29:51,580 --> 02:29:51,590
guys that are nipping at your heels and 
you decide,

3695
02:29:51,591 --> 02:29:56,591
no motherfuckers,
I am the man at the top of the mountain 

3696
02:29:56,591 --> 02:29:59,711
and I'm going to stay at the top of the 
mountain as long as my body hangs in 

3697
02:29:59,711 --> 02:29:59,711
there.
But again,

3698
02:29:59,711 --> 02:30:03,161
it's like that has to be something that 
you want to do and you could see the 

3699
02:30:03,161 --> 02:30:03,950
shift.
I see the shift in guys were,

3700
02:30:03,951 --> 02:30:08,951
they all of a sudden they do it for 
money and they started doing it for a 

3701
02:30:08,951 --> 02:30:11,471
living.
You see that shift and it's an ugly 

3702
02:30:11,471 --> 02:30:13,211
shift because they just don't have the 
same tenacity is like I see a lot and 

3703
02:30:13,421 --> 02:30:18,421
like nfl and stuff like that,
I'm sure we get tired of getting your 

3704
02:30:18,421 --> 02:30:22,181
fucking bell rang to men know he get 
tired of Bang Bang clashing heads with 

3705
02:30:22,761 --> 02:30:24,440
people and running into each other.

3706
02:30:24,710 --> 02:30:29,710
After a while that shit gets tired.
I remember there was a big basketball 

3707
02:30:29,710 --> 02:30:29,710
player,
um,

3708
02:30:29,710 --> 02:30:33,470
and he would play poker and it was funny
because he would go on these vendors and

3709
02:30:33,471 --> 02:30:35,490
he would play for like 24 hours straight
or something.

3710
02:30:35,800 --> 02:30:39,630
I just remember we just always bet 
against him and he was like a big,

3711
02:30:39,631 --> 02:30:42,080
big basketball player.
Like he was like the star on the team or

3712
02:30:42,081 --> 02:30:43,530
whatever.
And so we were just like,

3713
02:30:43,580 --> 02:30:46,010
always bet against like whatever team he
was playing,

3714
02:30:46,011 --> 02:30:48,170
if he had been playing poker for 24,
48 hours,

3715
02:30:48,171 --> 02:30:49,710
which is bet against the other team were
right,

3716
02:30:49,730 --> 02:30:54,730
like almost every time.
Like he just like always played like 

3717
02:30:54,730 --> 02:30:54,730
shit.
Yeah,

3718
02:30:54,730 --> 02:30:55,880
fuck yeah.
It's like mentally exhausting.

3719
02:30:55,881 --> 02:30:57,560
He's not sleeping,
you don't eat.

3720
02:30:57,561 --> 02:30:59,830
It's just like it's just hard on your 
body or you,

3721
02:30:59,860 --> 02:31:04,860
you're screwed.
The cortisone or whatever cortisol 

3722
02:31:04,860 --> 02:31:04,860
levels go up.

3723
02:31:04,860 --> 02:31:05,460
I mean it's just like,
yeah,

3724
02:31:05,530 --> 02:31:06,320
it's,
it's tough.

3725
02:31:06,350 --> 02:31:09,230
I mean it's a balancing act I think in 
anything in life,

3726
02:31:09,231 --> 02:31:14,231
but especially in risky things,
whether it's playing poker or fighting 

3727
02:31:14,231 --> 02:31:15,620
or anything along those lines.
Something that's really difficult to do.

3728
02:31:15,650 --> 02:31:20,650
There's this weird balancing act and you
have to this this perfect balance of 

3729
02:31:21,990 --> 02:31:24,480
motivation,
reward,

3730
02:31:24,481 --> 02:31:26,460
intensity,
focused,

3731
02:31:26,461 --> 02:31:28,710
disciplined,
but still pleasure.

3732
02:31:28,920 --> 02:31:32,700
You can't be miserable forever.
Like there's to be a time where you have

3733
02:31:32,701 --> 02:31:34,200
fun too.
It's hard.

3734
02:31:34,201 --> 02:31:34,950
I mean,
like I said,

3735
02:31:34,951 --> 02:31:37,050
I think it just comes down to like,
you just gotTa want it,

3736
02:31:37,230 --> 02:31:42,230
you know,
you just got to fucking just want it 

3737
02:31:42,230 --> 02:31:42,230
really bad.
But there was some study recently that I

3738
02:31:42,230 --> 02:31:46,110
was reading about whether they were 
talking about how you can't be happy all

3739
02:31:46,111 --> 02:31:48,810
the time and you don't want to be happy 
all the time.

3740
02:31:48,811 --> 02:31:53,811
Like literally,
you won't achieve the same levels of 

3741
02:31:53,811 --> 02:31:54,820
happiness all the time if you're not 
miserable like you,

3742
02:31:54,830 --> 02:31:59,830
you don't ever hit those highs unless 
you hit those lows like you ever been 

3743
02:31:59,830 --> 02:32:01,080
around someone who's manic ever day to 
check his manic.

3744
02:32:01,350 --> 02:32:04,750
I know where you're talking about the 
suite is a sweet,

3745
02:32:04,930 --> 02:32:05,050
the

3746
02:32:05,050 --> 02:32:09,040
bitter end.
And I've found that I'm actually have an

3747
02:32:09,041 --> 02:32:13,450
interesting outlook on that because I 
have bought pleasure for so long,

3748
02:32:14,140 --> 02:32:16,060
I can't buy happiness.
You can buy a pleasure though.

3749
02:32:16,310 --> 02:32:17,380
And a lot of people say,
oh,

3750
02:32:17,381 --> 02:32:22,381
money isn't happiness,
money can buy a boat and the boat will 

3751
02:32:22,381 --> 02:32:22,381
make me fucking happy.
That kind of thing.

3752
02:32:22,381 --> 02:32:24,640
Right?
So I'm an example I like to give is,

3753
02:32:25,010 --> 02:32:26,830
you know,
when I was 16,

3754
02:32:26,860 --> 02:32:29,260
like my dream car was a,
um,

3755
02:32:29,530 --> 02:32:30,730
a Mustang Cobra,
right?

3756
02:32:30,731 --> 02:32:33,430
So if I got a Mustang Cobra,
I would have been a 10,

3757
02:32:33,760 --> 02:32:35,440
right?
Um,

3758
02:32:36,070 --> 02:32:37,000
but,
you know,

3759
02:32:37,001 --> 02:32:38,770
a Ferrari would also bring me to a 10.
I mean,

3760
02:32:38,771 --> 02:32:40,210
he,
but you can't go higher than a 10,

3761
02:32:40,211 --> 02:32:42,070
right?
So let's just say that I got,

3762
02:32:42,190 --> 02:32:43,320
um,
you know,

3763
02:32:43,321 --> 02:32:43,830
uh,
you know,

3764
02:32:43,840 --> 02:32:46,900
the,
when I was 16 and now we flash forward,

3765
02:32:46,901 --> 02:32:50,410
I graduated college and my dad gives me 
a,

3766
02:32:50,950 --> 02:32:54,460
let's say he gives me a BMW m five,
if I had the Ferrari,

3767
02:32:54,490 --> 02:32:56,680
now I'm going to be kind of like 
probably at a seven,

3768
02:32:56,681 --> 02:32:56,830
right?

3769
02:32:56,830 --> 02:33:01,830
Because I'm stepping down on a car.
But if I had the Mustang Cobra and now 

3770
02:33:01,830 --> 02:33:02,530
I'm going to an m five,
I'm going to be back at a 10.

3771
02:33:03,070 --> 02:33:05,980
Well it's the same car.
You're the same person.

3772
02:33:05,981 --> 02:33:10,981
You're at the same spot in life.
The only difference is your perspective 

3773
02:33:10,981 --> 02:33:11,290
because your previous experience,
you know,

3774
02:33:11,291 --> 02:33:16,291
so it's Kinda like when people ask like 
why rich people aren't as happy and I 

3775
02:33:17,291 --> 02:33:22,291
just think it's because they've upped 
the bar so far that only the best things

3776
02:33:23,860 --> 02:33:26,500
satisfy them.
Like a guy off the street.

3777
02:33:26,501 --> 02:33:28,380
If I took like when I was going to the 
bootcamp,

3778
02:33:28,450 --> 02:33:30,540
I'll use that as an example.
I go to outback steakhouse,

3779
02:33:30,610 --> 02:33:35,610
I'm going to 10 right now.
If I go to the best restaurant in the 

3780
02:33:35,610 --> 02:33:35,860
fucking world.
I mean,

3781
02:33:35,861 --> 02:33:37,950
I'm like maybe like a six or a seven.
I'm just like,

3782
02:33:37,990 --> 02:33:39,430
satisfied.
I got three chefs,

3783
02:33:39,431 --> 02:33:41,740
like I eat the best food all the time,
you know what I mean?

3784
02:33:41,740 --> 02:33:43,690
So like that doesn't make me happy 
anymore.

3785
02:33:43,960 --> 02:33:45,790
Like if,
if somebody bought me a Lamborghini,

3786
02:33:45,791 --> 02:33:47,620
I'd be like whatever,
like I've had them,

3787
02:33:47,621 --> 02:33:49,800
I don't care like it.
But if you're gay,

3788
02:33:50,150 --> 02:33:51,670
you know,
give it a guy off the street,

3789
02:33:51,671 --> 02:33:54,490
he'd be at a 10 so I can't buy happiness
anymore.

3790
02:33:54,520 --> 02:33:57,280
You know what I mean?
I bought every fucking thing that I ever

3791
02:33:57,281 --> 02:33:57,850
wanted,
right.

3792
02:33:57,851 --> 02:34:01,390
There's not really anything that I want 
so I can't buy any like,

3793
02:34:01,391 --> 02:34:02,830
pleasure.
Um,

3794
02:34:03,010 --> 02:34:07,240
and also if you gave me like a regular 
car or put me in a regular hotel,

3795
02:34:07,600 --> 02:34:10,150
I would actually be it like below the 
normal level.

3796
02:34:10,151 --> 02:34:13,270
Whereas a normal person would be like 
happy to be on a vacation,

3797
02:34:13,271 --> 02:34:18,271
you know what I'm saying?
So like I think that has like some 

3798
02:34:18,271 --> 02:34:18,271
correlation.
It's Kinda

3799
02:34:18,271 --> 02:34:20,650
like a guy that wins the lotto like a 
year later.

3800
02:34:20,651 --> 02:34:25,651
He is like statistically less happy than
a guy that got his leg amputated a year 

3801
02:34:26,051 --> 02:34:27,400
prior,
you know?

3802
02:34:27,630 --> 02:34:28,770
Yes.
That's,

3803
02:34:28,910 --> 02:34:30,070
that's interesting.
It's also,

3804
02:34:30,071 --> 02:34:32,110
I think,
what are you trying to do?

3805
02:34:32,230 --> 02:34:35,020
Like do a lot of people that are trying 
to get rich because they think that once

3806
02:34:35,021 --> 02:34:40,021
they get rich there'll be happy.
They think that that's going to give 

3807
02:34:40,021 --> 02:34:40,021
them this thing that they've always been
missing.

3808
02:34:40,021 --> 02:34:44,911
And so they've been working hard,
busting their ass and they look at all 

3809
02:34:44,911 --> 02:34:44,911
these other people like we're talking 
about,

3810
02:34:44,911 --> 02:34:45,160
you know,
you uh,

3811
02:34:45,161 --> 02:34:47,090
you land your private jet,
you drive your,

3812
02:34:47,150 --> 02:34:49,150
your Bentley to the club.
And everybody's like,

3813
02:34:49,180 --> 02:34:49,810
oh,
samples,

3814
02:34:51,220 --> 02:34:52,300
you want to be that guy.
Right?

3815
02:34:52,301 --> 02:34:53,970
But once you're that guy,
it's like,

3816
02:34:53,980 --> 02:34:58,980
that doesn't mean anything anymore.
And then for a lot of people there's 

3817
02:34:58,980 --> 02:34:59,320
this emptiness,
there's nothing left to chase,

3818
02:34:59,321 --> 02:35:00,400
there's nothing else to do.

3819
02:35:00,400 --> 02:35:04,390
And your life is just about possessions 
and upping the ante.

3820
02:35:04,391 --> 02:35:06,880
And now I got to get a yacht and now I 
have to get the biggest yacht.

3821
02:35:06,920 --> 02:35:08,950
Now I've got to buy an island,
you know,

3822
02:35:08,951 --> 02:35:11,260
and trying to find something to fill 
that void.

3823
02:35:11,261 --> 02:35:16,210
Because you've sort of set your life up 
to chase these material goals instead of

3824
02:35:16,211 --> 02:35:20,020
to try to find out what actually does 
make you happy.

3825
02:35:20,240 --> 02:35:23,020
You have to have goals and you have to 
have stuff that like,

3826
02:35:23,280 --> 02:35:28,280
you know,
you got to be climbing the mountain 

3827
02:35:28,280 --> 02:35:29,941
because at the end of the day like 
climbing the mountain is far more 

3828
02:35:29,941 --> 02:35:29,941
satisfying than being at the top of the 
mountain.

3829
02:35:29,941 --> 02:35:31,000
You know?
Isn't that weird though?

3830
02:35:31,030 --> 02:35:33,130
That's not what we've ever been taught.
Well,

3831
02:35:33,131 --> 02:35:35,730
it's counterintuitive because most 
people don't like get the,

3832
02:35:35,780 --> 02:35:37,300
they just know that like,
okay,

3833
02:35:37,420 --> 02:35:38,290
like,
you know,

3834
02:35:38,291 --> 02:35:40,840
my dad told me like it's better to give 
than receive.

3835
02:35:40,840 --> 02:35:42,470
And I was like okay,
that's perfect by the burglary unit,

3836
02:35:42,471 --> 02:35:44,760
just give me shit and I'll receive it 
and I'll be happy.

3837
02:35:44,780 --> 02:35:45,610
Like,
you know what I'm saying?

3838
02:35:45,611 --> 02:35:46,600
Like,
but you don't have it.

3839
02:35:46,601 --> 02:35:48,580
If you don't have it then that makes 
sense.

3840
02:35:48,750 --> 02:35:49,360
Yeah,
exactly.

3841
02:35:49,361 --> 02:35:50,620
And like,
you know,

3842
02:35:50,660 --> 02:35:52,780
just people.
I mean it's just experience like,

3843
02:35:52,781 --> 02:35:54,910
I mean like from the time you're a 
little kid,

3844
02:35:54,911 --> 02:35:56,230
you get something,
you're happy.

3845
02:35:56,231 --> 02:35:58,000
Like you know,
you get a boat,

3846
02:35:58,001 --> 02:35:59,710
you're happy.
Like if I have this bike,

3847
02:35:59,711 --> 02:36:01,870
I'm be happy and,
and it's true and it works,

3848
02:36:01,871 --> 02:36:06,871
you know what I mean?
But there's a point you almost have to 

3849
02:36:06,871 --> 02:36:10,141
like get really rich to understand that 
you really have to just buy all that 

3850
02:36:10,141 --> 02:36:10,480
shit.
It was okay.

3851
02:36:10,481 --> 02:36:11,980
Like I got it all,
it's cool.

3852
02:36:11,981 --> 02:36:13,600
That made me happy,
but it's temporary,

3853
02:36:13,601 --> 02:36:14,070
you know?
That's,

3854
02:36:14,100 --> 02:36:16,960
that's I,
that's kind of where I differentiate the

3855
02:36:16,990 --> 02:36:18,340
happiness and the pleasure,
you know,

3856
02:36:18,341 --> 02:36:21,000
you can buy the pleasure for the 
pleasure is somewhat short lived,

3857
02:36:21,001 --> 02:36:21,150
you know?

3858
02:36:21,610 --> 02:36:26,610
Yeah.
I had a conversation with someone about 

3859
02:36:26,610 --> 02:36:26,610
this recently where I was saying that 
material possessions,

3860
02:36:26,610 --> 02:36:28,450
once you have enough money to acquire 
basically everything you want,

3861
02:36:28,630 --> 02:36:31,210
they don't mean anything anymore.
So they don't mean anything.

3862
02:36:31,270 --> 02:36:33,370
You can enjoy them when you have them.
What if you lose them?

3863
02:36:33,400 --> 02:36:35,180
It's really not that big a deal.
You know,

3864
02:36:35,181 --> 02:36:37,600
if like if you get an escalate and 
fucking meteor hits,

3865
02:36:37,630 --> 02:36:40,040
you're escalating and go out there.
Homes get another escalate,

3866
02:36:40,070 --> 02:36:41,950
there's bunch of them.
It's no big deal.

3867
02:36:42,130 --> 02:36:47,130
But if that was all you had and you had 
a save and scrape up your money to get 

3868
02:36:47,130 --> 02:36:49,360
that escalate and he kept it clean,
then it got hit by a meteor.

3869
02:36:49,361 --> 02:36:50,490
You'd be devastated.
Yeah.

3870
02:36:50,860 --> 02:36:55,090
Once you have achieved this level of 
success where material possessions don't

3871
02:36:55,091 --> 02:36:58,050
mean anything anymore,
then you can kind of like,

3872
02:36:58,120 --> 02:36:59,580
okay,
well what do I enjoy?

3873
02:36:59,620 --> 02:37:01,300
Camaraderie,
friendship,

3874
02:37:01,301 --> 02:37:06,301
creativity.
Like what is it that I'm actually 

3875
02:37:06,301 --> 02:37:08,341
chasing?
Because I remember talking to this 

3876
02:37:08,341 --> 02:37:08,440
Buddhist monk,
I had to do this thing once where I went

3877
02:37:08,441 --> 02:37:13,441
to all these different religions.
It was for this TV show and I 

3878
02:37:13,441 --> 02:37:15,230
interviewed all these different people 
and ask them like,

3879
02:37:15,231 --> 02:37:15,970
what?
You know,

3880
02:37:16,010 --> 02:37:17,810
what is it about your religion that's 
the best.

3881
02:37:17,811 --> 02:37:19,250
Like say if I was going to join your 
religion,

3882
02:37:19,300 --> 02:37:24,300
you try to sell me your salad,
and the Buddhist guy was saying that sex

3883
02:37:25,400 --> 02:37:27,290
and all these material possessions,
they,

3884
02:37:27,340 --> 02:37:30,800
they possess you and that to be 
completely free,

3885
02:37:30,801 --> 02:37:33,740
you have to be abstinent and you have to
be free of material possessions.

3886
02:37:33,741 --> 02:37:34,130
I said,
well,

3887
02:37:34,131 --> 02:37:35,450
why?
I go,

3888
02:37:35,451 --> 02:37:39,260
what if you achieve a level of success 
where you don't worry about those things

3889
02:37:39,261 --> 02:37:40,880
anymore and they don't,
they don't,

3890
02:37:41,510 --> 02:37:43,770
they don't contain you,
they don't hold you there,

3891
02:37:43,790 --> 02:37:47,000
you're not a prisoner of them because 
you're really not worried about them.

3892
02:37:47,180 --> 02:37:51,950
Like if all you had was this one thing 
and that one thing was taken from you,

3893
02:37:51,951 --> 02:37:53,990
that would be devastating and that's 
what this is based on.

3894
02:37:54,410 --> 02:37:56,720
But what if you had unlimited resources?
If you were,

3895
02:37:56,721 --> 02:37:59,270
if you were Richard Branson or someone 
like you or whatever,

3896
02:37:59,630 --> 02:38:04,630
when you're,
it's not an issue then then those 

3897
02:38:04,630 --> 02:38:04,760
material possessions no longer possess 
you,

3898
02:38:05,240 --> 02:38:06,830
but this guy didn't want to look at it 
that way.

3899
02:38:07,070 --> 02:38:09,530
Like he didn't want to think that that 
was ever a possibly an option.

3900
02:38:09,560 --> 02:38:09,920
I'm like,
well,

3901
02:38:09,921 --> 02:38:14,921
it's not an option because you don't 
think it's possible to achieve that 

3902
02:38:14,921 --> 02:38:16,010
level of material possession of that 
material success.

3903
02:38:16,090 --> 02:38:21,090
Yeah.
And that's Kinda the thing I feel like 

3904
02:38:21,090 --> 02:38:22,651
you have to,
you have to get to that place to 

3905
02:38:22,651 --> 02:38:22,651
understand it.
You know,

3906
02:38:22,651 --> 02:38:23,550
it's Kinda like tell him that

3907
02:38:23,560 --> 02:38:28,560
to anybody who's listening to this like 
99 point nine percent of people 

3908
02:38:28,560 --> 02:38:31,711
listening to this are never going to 
make a fraction of the amount of money 

3909
02:38:31,711 --> 02:38:31,711
that you've earned.

3910
02:38:31,711 --> 02:38:32,880
Yeah.
But you know,

3911
02:38:33,160 --> 02:38:38,160
in some ways that is a blessing because 
they're going to have a lifetime of 

3912
02:38:38,160 --> 02:38:40,660
being able to buy that pleasure to 
because of that.

3913
02:38:40,661 --> 02:38:45,661
You know,
because if you start here on this lower 

3914
02:38:45,661 --> 02:38:46,600
rung than all those little purchases and
stuff like that,

3915
02:38:46,601 --> 02:38:49,420
you're still like,
you're enjoying the shit out there.

3916
02:38:50,210 --> 02:38:52,110
Their baseline is just lower,
right?

3917
02:38:52,150 --> 02:38:54,010
They get a new fishing rod,
they're fucking pumped.

3918
02:38:54,040 --> 02:38:55,000
Exactly.
You know,

3919
02:38:55,001 --> 02:39:00,001
and when that wears off,
then they're gonna get a new reel and 

3920
02:39:00,001 --> 02:39:00,001
you know,
when that wears off,

3921
02:39:00,001 --> 02:39:01,660
they're gonna buy a new depth finder.
What,

3922
02:39:01,661 --> 02:39:03,460
you know what I'm saying?
It's like it's the little ship,

3923
02:39:03,461 --> 02:39:05,170
that little shit.
If it makes them happy,

3924
02:39:05,171 --> 02:39:06,760
then that's,
then that's okay.

3925
02:39:06,761 --> 02:39:07,080
But,

3926
02:39:07,250 --> 02:39:08,660
but to the people listening to this 
right now,

3927
02:39:08,661 --> 02:39:09,410
they're thinking,
okay,

3928
02:39:09,411 --> 02:39:14,411
well you're equating material 
possessions in the acquisition of these 

3929
02:39:14,411 --> 02:39:15,440
material possessions as being the thing 
that makes people happy.

3930
02:39:15,441 --> 02:39:20,441
Now is this because you've got 15 
bitches and you're flying around on 

3931
02:39:20,441 --> 02:39:23,450
private jets and yachts and you're,
you're lacking like real depth to you.

3932
02:39:23,451 --> 02:39:25,430
You're a smart guy.
You're not a dumb guy.

3933
02:39:25,760 --> 02:39:28,130
So I don't,
I don't think that that's the case.

3934
02:39:28,520 --> 02:39:30,650
I think you're having a lot of fun and 
you're,

3935
02:39:30,651 --> 02:39:32,240
you know,
you're doing a lot of wild,

3936
02:39:32,241 --> 02:39:37,241
crazy shit.
But I don't think you're lacking in 

3937
02:39:37,241 --> 02:39:37,241
depth.

3938
02:39:37,241 --> 02:39:40,130
Yeah,
no I am just trying to fully experience 

3939
02:39:40,130 --> 02:39:44,360
everything that I wanted to experience.
And there also a part of me that's,

3940
02:39:44,900 --> 02:39:47,610
you know,
Kinda doing some wish fulfillment,

3941
02:39:47,611 --> 02:39:52,150
some part of me that's overcompensating 
for lack of things,

3942
02:39:52,151 --> 02:39:57,151
you know,
that I had childhood was or when I was 

3943
02:39:57,151 --> 02:39:59,721
growing up or that I wanted or whatever 
it was basically just kinda like 

3944
02:39:59,721 --> 02:40:01,710
whatever I wanted when I was younger or 
whatever I place emphasis on,

3945
02:40:01,711 --> 02:40:06,570
I kinda like just overexaggerated and 
beat it into the fucking dirt.

3946
02:40:06,571 --> 02:40:10,080
So then now I can move on and do 
something else like my life,

3947
02:40:10,110 --> 02:40:11,850
you know,
I have,

3948
02:40:11,910 --> 02:40:12,990
I have add,
so for,

3949
02:40:13,200 --> 02:40:18,200
it's like hypersensitive or real.
I think it is and I think I think a lot 

3950
02:40:18,200 --> 02:40:20,820
of successful people have it and I think
what it allows you to do is when you are

3951
02:40:20,821 --> 02:40:24,390
focused on something and when you have 
that like pinpoint focus,

3952
02:40:24,391 --> 02:40:27,390
you can be extremely successful but when
you don't,

3953
02:40:27,391 --> 02:40:32,391
you're just scattered all over the 
fucking map and you can't accomplish 

3954
02:40:32,391 --> 02:40:32,391
anything.

3955
02:40:32,391 --> 02:40:36,290
I mean you're just like.
And I think a lot of kids have nowadays 

3956
02:40:36,290 --> 02:40:36,780
because of the stimulus,
I think.

3957
02:40:36,781 --> 02:40:41,781
I think you have so much stimulus at 
your fingertips nowadays that these 

3958
02:40:41,781 --> 02:40:42,060
kids,
if they're not,

3959
02:40:42,830 --> 02:40:47,830
I guess I guess what I'm trying to say 
is that people just overstimulated in 

3960
02:40:47,830 --> 02:40:48,900
and because they have it at their 
fingertips all the time.

3961
02:40:48,901 --> 02:40:53,901
Like when I was a kid,
like we used to have to entertain 

3962
02:40:53,901 --> 02:40:56,841
ourselves.
You said it was just like go out and 

3963
02:40:56,841 --> 02:40:56,841
play,
you know,

3964
02:40:56,841 --> 02:40:58,710
and just like figure out shit to do.
And so we didn't need massive amounts of

3965
02:40:58,711 --> 02:41:03,711
stimulus nowadays.
If kids don't have a fucking video game 

3966
02:41:03,711 --> 02:41:06,060
and a movie playing at the same time,
they're bored and three other friends to

3967
02:41:06,061 --> 02:41:06,690
talk to,
you know,

3968
02:41:06,691 --> 02:41:08,760
so it's when they're hanging out and 
they're constantly checking their phone,

3969
02:41:08,761 --> 02:41:09,750
they're not even looking at each other.

3970
02:41:09,750 --> 02:41:10,460
They know.
Yeah.

3971
02:41:11,020 --> 02:41:12,300
And I'm victim of it too,
you know,

3972
02:41:12,301 --> 02:41:13,040
it's like,
it's like,

3973
02:41:13,350 --> 02:41:14,610
it's crazy you'll,
you'll be,

3974
02:41:14,760 --> 02:41:16,740
you'll be in a social setting and 
there'll be five,

3975
02:41:16,741 --> 02:41:19,650
six people at a table and they'll all be
on their phones and it's just like,

3976
02:41:19,860 --> 02:41:23,040
it's Kinda sad that,
that we've been reduced to that level of

3977
02:41:23,041 --> 02:41:25,700
interaction where it's just like 
electronic,

3978
02:41:25,740 --> 02:41:27,900
like this just all electronic and 
people,

3979
02:41:28,130 --> 02:41:33,130
you know,
like I mean when people call people 

3980
02:41:33,130 --> 02:41:33,130
nowadays,
this is like,

3981
02:41:33,130 --> 02:41:33,130
wait,
what the fuck?

3982
02:41:33,130 --> 02:41:34,350
Like why are you calling me back when we
were kids,

3983
02:41:34,420 --> 02:41:36,630
like there wasn't even texting,
you know,

3984
02:41:36,631 --> 02:41:41,631
it was like flip phones.
Like now it's like if somebody calls 

3985
02:41:41,631 --> 02:41:41,631
you,
it's like,

3986
02:41:41,631 --> 02:41:41,631
wait,
what the fuck?

3987
02:41:41,631 --> 02:41:42,600
I go,
I have one friend,

3988
02:41:42,601 --> 02:41:45,060
Joey Diaz.
We never text each other ever.

3989
02:41:45,210 --> 02:41:46,530
He might've texted me once,
I was like,

3990
02:41:46,531 --> 02:41:47,550
what the fuck is going on?

3991
02:41:47,820 --> 02:41:48,900
All we do is call.
He goes,

3992
02:41:48,901 --> 02:41:50,250
I don't like to text.
He goes,

3993
02:41:50,251 --> 02:41:51,630
I like the car,
I want to hear your voice.

3994
02:41:51,631 --> 02:41:53,310
I'm insecure.
I want to know you love me.

3995
02:41:53,700 --> 02:41:55,560
Like you.
He wants to talk to you on the phone.

3996
02:41:56,130 --> 02:41:57,480
I think that's,
yeah,

3997
02:41:57,560 --> 02:41:59,190
we're,
we're definitely missing something.

3998
02:41:59,191 --> 02:42:02,940
We definitely missing something by all 
this electronic shit,

3999
02:42:02,970 --> 02:42:05,460
but it's,
it's also like a new style of living and

4000
02:42:05,461 --> 02:42:09,310
I'm sure humans will adjust eventually.
We'll figure it out how to manage it or,

4001
02:42:09,370 --> 02:42:14,370
or change accordingly.
The one positive thing I think is just 

4002
02:42:14,370 --> 02:42:14,430
that you,

4003
02:42:15,500 --> 02:42:17,390
you're so connected,
you know,

4004
02:42:17,391 --> 02:42:22,391
everybody.
I feel like everybody's more connected 

4005
02:42:22,391 --> 02:42:22,391
now.
Like back when we were kids,

4006
02:42:22,391 --> 02:42:24,200
like you know,
a guy in Idaho is never going to fucking

4007
02:42:24,470 --> 02:42:27,920
feel any connection whatsoever with 
somebody that's in California,

4008
02:42:27,921 --> 02:42:32,921
but now like that guy can upload a 
youtube video and everybody around the 

4009
02:42:32,921 --> 02:42:33,920
world can see it and people are just,
you know,

4010
02:42:33,921 --> 02:42:36,200
dating wise,
social media wise,

4011
02:42:36,201 --> 02:42:37,220
like whatever.
They're just,

4012
02:42:37,580 --> 02:42:39,820
there is more connection.
I mean I feel like it's,

4013
02:42:40,070 --> 02:42:43,190
it's not quite as real and it's not as 
tangible but.

4014
02:42:43,700 --> 02:42:48,700
And people I think are also losing,
I'm losing the ability to kind of like 

4015
02:42:49,491 --> 02:42:52,370
interact like I like my older friends,
like we'll sit around,

4016
02:42:52,371 --> 02:42:54,500
we'll tell stories and it's like we'll 
have fun.

4017
02:42:54,501 --> 02:42:57,770
And it's like the younger generation 
when you watch them interact,

4018
02:42:57,771 --> 02:43:02,771
it's almost comical.
It's like these people like socially 

4019
02:43:02,771 --> 02:43:05,801
awkward,
like they don't like people don't know 

4020
02:43:05,801 --> 02:43:07,841
how to like approach girls anymore.
It's just like in the whole thing has 

4021
02:43:07,841 --> 02:43:08,330
been reduced to like online dating,

4022
02:43:10,220 --> 02:43:10,870
you know,
it's,

4023
02:43:10,871 --> 02:43:12,070
it's a,
it's a new world

4024
02:43:12,070 --> 02:43:12,820
for sure.
I mean,

4025
02:43:12,821 --> 02:43:17,821
I don't know there's a new world,
but what I found really fascinating is 

4026
02:43:17,821 --> 02:43:21,331
that because I travel a lot doing stand 
up is that there's no dumb places 

4027
02:43:21,331 --> 02:43:22,510
anymore.
Like you can go to,

4028
02:43:22,780 --> 02:43:27,780
you know,
fill in the blank some place in the 

4029
02:43:27,780 --> 02:43:27,780
middle of the Midwest,
Boise,

4030
02:43:27,780 --> 02:43:30,991
Idaho or whatever.
And you'll do a show there and the 

4031
02:43:30,991 --> 02:43:34,231
fucking people are on the ball.
They know what the fuck's going on 

4032
02:43:34,231 --> 02:43:34,231
there.
There's so much more informed.

4033
02:43:34,420 --> 02:43:39,420
When I used to travel on the road in the
nineties when I used to do stand up in 

4034
02:43:39,420 --> 02:43:40,660
the nineties and you know,
fly into Ohio or sorry Jamie,

4035
02:43:41,050 --> 02:43:45,100
fly into someplace in the middle of the 
country is fucking people were apes.

4036
02:43:45,400 --> 02:43:47,050
I mean they didn't know anything.
They were like,

4037
02:43:47,080 --> 02:43:51,250
what's it like to be on an airplane?
Mean fucking didn't know anything.

4038
02:43:51,251 --> 02:43:51,580
No one.

4039
02:43:51,610 --> 02:43:56,610
But now it's like you run into the same 
kind of people in la that you can run 

4040
02:43:56,610 --> 02:43:58,360
into in fill in the blank,
you know,

4041
02:43:58,361 --> 02:44:00,220
Phoenix or whatever,
wherever the fuck it is.

4042
02:44:00,221 --> 02:44:02,910
There's no dumb cities anymore because 
you're still gonna.

4043
02:44:02,930 --> 02:44:07,930
Find some dumb people.
But I think overall the awareness level 

4044
02:44:07,930 --> 02:44:12,091
of people has changed and I think that's
a lot due to the internet,

4045
02:44:12,310 --> 02:44:13,560
you know,
honest that accident.

4046
02:44:13,561 --> 02:44:14,880
I mean,
when I was a kid,

4047
02:44:14,881 --> 02:44:16,450
if I wanted to know something,
her mom's like,

4048
02:44:16,451 --> 02:44:21,451
okay,
look it up and the encyclopedia 

4049
02:44:21,451 --> 02:44:21,451
Britannica.
And I'm like fuck that.

4050
02:44:21,451 --> 02:44:25,490
I'm not going to do that.
And we literally would have like 

4051
02:44:25,490 --> 02:44:26,640
hundreds of encyclopedias around the 
thing and like,

4052
02:44:27,150 --> 02:44:28,600
you know,
we thought that was great,

4053
02:44:28,601 --> 02:44:30,760
but now it's like you want to know 
something,

4054
02:44:30,790 --> 02:44:32,890
you google it and you just instantly 
know it.

4055
02:44:32,891 --> 02:44:35,290
Like you don't even have to press it,
you just talk into your phone.

4056
02:44:35,500 --> 02:44:36,660
You don't have to type,
you know?

4057
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:38,280
Yeah.
You just ask Siri.

4058
02:44:38,281 --> 02:44:42,880
It's like google cold fusion shows you 
instantaneously.

4059
02:44:42,881 --> 02:44:47,881
I mean,
it's so freaky that they didn't even 

4060
02:44:47,881 --> 02:44:47,881
think about it in star trek or star 
wars.

4061
02:44:47,881 --> 02:44:51,190
None of those places had the internet.
None of those visions of science fiction

4062
02:44:51,191 --> 02:44:52,410
in the future had the internet.
It's,

4063
02:44:52,420 --> 02:44:53,480
it's,
it's.

4064
02:44:53,620 --> 02:44:56,350
I think it's going to be when,
when history is all said and done,

4065
02:44:56,351 --> 02:45:01,351
when people look back on this era as 
it's going to be one of the biggest 

4066
02:45:01,351 --> 02:45:02,140
changes in the human race ever.
And we're in the middle of it.

4067
02:45:02,141 --> 02:45:04,180
It's a storm and we're just caught up in
it.

4068
02:45:04,450 --> 02:45:09,450
And like you were talking about when you
were saying how you're so wealthy and 

4069
02:45:09,450 --> 02:45:12,751
it's just normal,
it just becomes normal to you to have 

4070
02:45:12,751 --> 02:45:12,751
all this money and someone gives you a 
Lamborghini.

4071
02:45:12,751 --> 02:45:12,910
It's normal.
Well,

4072
02:45:12,911 --> 02:45:15,550
this wealth of information is normal to 
us.

4073
02:45:15,580 --> 02:45:17,440
It just seems normal,
you know,

4074
02:45:17,441 --> 02:45:19,060
and you know,
my kids are young,

4075
02:45:19,061 --> 02:45:21,100
they're grown up with the internet their
whole life.

4076
02:45:21,130 --> 02:45:22,990
They've never experienced anything but 
the internet.

4077
02:45:22,991 --> 02:45:27,991
So it's to them they're not gonna know 
how weird it was to run into bullshit 

4078
02:45:27,991 --> 02:45:29,260
artists now.
People just lied about stuff.

4079
02:45:29,290 --> 02:45:30,740
Like you couldn't google them,
you know,

4080
02:45:30,790 --> 02:45:35,790
now you can just like,
if you want to know about somebody 

4081
02:45:35,790 --> 02:45:35,790
fucking google them and it's like,
okay,

4082
02:45:35,790 --> 02:45:36,640
this guy's a scam artist.
This chick's a hooker.

4083
02:45:37,060 --> 02:45:39,430
You just got their life story.
It's like Bam,

4084
02:45:39,431 --> 02:45:41,430
like wikipedia or else.
Yeah,

4085
02:45:41,440 --> 02:45:44,110
it's Kinda crazy.
Before we did the podcast,

4086
02:45:44,320 --> 02:45:49,320
we started talking about psychedelics 
and you started talking about some 

4087
02:45:49,320 --> 02:45:50,200
psychedelic experiences that you had.
And I still like save it,

4088
02:45:50,770 --> 02:45:53,350
save it,
because I wanted to talk to you about it

4089
02:45:53,351 --> 02:45:54,370
on the air.
So tell me,

4090
02:45:54,430 --> 02:45:55,720
tell me what,
what has happened?

4091
02:45:56,200 --> 02:45:57,190
I mean,
you actually,

4092
02:45:57,191 --> 02:46:00,360
the one that turned me onto it,
the DMT.

4093
02:46:01,410 --> 02:46:02,380
Um,
I was,

4094
02:46:02,410 --> 02:46:07,410
the first time I tried,
I was at burning man and I smoked a 

4095
02:46:07,410 --> 02:46:07,610
small amount of it.
Um,

4096
02:46:08,400 --> 02:46:09,420
and it was interesting.
I was,

4097
02:46:09,421 --> 02:46:09,860
I mean,
it was,

4098
02:46:10,220 --> 02:46:12,380
I felt like it was a pretty enlightening
experience.

4099
02:46:12,470 --> 02:46:15,530
Um,
I tried it a second time.

4100
02:46:15,560 --> 02:46:18,350
We had this small Malik,
how many hits?

4101
02:46:18,440 --> 02:46:19,910
Just one,
just one.

4102
02:46:19,911 --> 02:46:20,620
So I was uh,
you know,

4103
02:46:20,630 --> 02:46:23,390
it wasn't like deep in it or anything.
It's got to the doorway.

4104
02:46:23,480 --> 02:46:24,980
Took a look inside.
Yeah.

4105
02:46:24,981 --> 02:46:26,000
And I just,
I don't know,

4106
02:46:26,001 --> 02:46:28,490
it felt like a little bit of sense of 
peace and clarity,

4107
02:46:28,491 --> 02:46:30,350
you know,
but that was all I really got from it.

4108
02:46:30,351 --> 02:46:32,320
The second time I did not have a good 
experience.

4109
02:46:32,350 --> 02:46:36,070
I had this,
a Shaolin monk come over and he a priest

4110
02:46:36,110 --> 02:46:39,860
or whatever you call them and um,
I don't know if we did too much,

4111
02:46:40,370 --> 02:46:45,370
but I just didn't really get too much.
I actually got more out of it after,

4112
02:46:46,550 --> 02:46:50,360
um,
but during the experience it was like,

4113
02:46:51,110 --> 02:46:53,390
it was just too much.
I didn't really get anything.

4114
02:46:53,580 --> 02:46:55,910
It was just almost like overwhelming.
Yeah.

4115
02:46:55,940 --> 02:46:57,890
Yeah.
It was just overwhelming where like,

4116
02:46:58,650 --> 02:46:59,540
yeah,
it was almost like a,

4117
02:46:59,600 --> 02:47:04,600
almost like a video game,
kind of the best way to describe it 

4118
02:47:04,600 --> 02:47:08,681
where I just like kinda almost seemed 
like everything was kind of like 

4119
02:47:08,681 --> 02:47:08,890
separating apart,
um,

4120
02:47:08,891 --> 02:47:11,570
but didn't really get too much.
Um,

4121
02:47:12,140 --> 02:47:15,500
and then the third time I had a similar 
experience.

4122
02:47:15,560 --> 02:47:19,020
Um,
but that was,

4123
02:47:19,080 --> 02:47:24,080
that was just a smoking.
I haven't done Iowasca or anything like 

4124
02:47:24,080 --> 02:47:24,410
that.
I did mushrooms three times.

4125
02:47:24,550 --> 02:47:26,390
Um,
it was funny.

4126
02:47:26,391 --> 02:47:28,400
I,
I had a couple,

4127
02:47:29,090 --> 02:47:31,930
so the first time I did mushrooms I 
think goes was in high school and I just

4128
02:47:31,940 --> 02:47:35,150
never forget because it was like 1:30
in the morning or whatever.

4129
02:47:35,510 --> 02:47:40,510
And I just wanted to call all my friends
and tell them how great it was and have 

4130
02:47:40,510 --> 02:47:40,510
conversation.
I remember them picking up the phone,

4131
02:47:40,510 --> 02:47:43,580
like Cheetahs 30 fuck off,
but I was just like,

4132
02:47:43,581 --> 02:47:44,510
I want to talk to everybody.

4133
02:47:44,510 --> 02:47:49,510
I was like,
I was having a good time and then I did 

4134
02:47:49,510 --> 02:47:53,231
an Amsterdam,
got sick and it was funny because I 

4135
02:47:53,570 --> 02:47:55,940
actually did it four times.
The third time I did it,

4136
02:47:55,941 --> 02:48:00,941
we were in Amsterdam and we were walking
down this long alleyway and we were 

4137
02:48:01,521 --> 02:48:06,521
probably about 75 yards down the 
alleyway and a buddy of mine,

4138
02:48:06,950 --> 02:48:07,760
it was like,
oh,

4139
02:48:08,100 --> 02:48:13,100
give me a second,
and we kept walking and we turn around 

4140
02:48:13,240 --> 02:48:15,610
about five seconds later,
10 seconds later,

4141
02:48:15,611 --> 02:48:19,390
and he was gone and it was probably like
a 200 yard.

4142
02:48:19,391 --> 02:48:19,900
Allie,
where's,

4143
02:48:19,910 --> 02:48:22,540
I mean this guy was fucking Ben Johnson.
He couldn't have made.

4144
02:48:22,541 --> 02:48:24,320
It was like a long,
long alleyway there.

4145
02:48:24,480 --> 02:48:27,010
If he was in a dead sprint is a fast guy
in the world.

4146
02:48:27,011 --> 02:48:30,550
He couldn't have made it the end and 
there was no like no ladders,

4147
02:48:30,551 --> 02:48:31,840
no nothing.
We're just like,

4148
02:48:32,650 --> 02:48:34,960
what the fuck happened and this dude,
we're just like,

4149
02:48:34,961 --> 02:48:37,600
and nobody can and we haven't even 
really started tripping,

4150
02:48:37,660 --> 02:48:42,660
but we're like,
we thought this do got abducted by 

4151
02:48:42,660 --> 02:48:42,660
aliens.

4152
02:48:42,660 --> 02:48:43,180
There was like no explanation,
right?

4153
02:48:43,181 --> 02:48:44,710
With like turnaround and we're just 
like,

4154
02:48:45,280 --> 02:48:48,010
we all looked at each other like,
what the fuck happened?

4155
02:48:48,370 --> 02:48:50,340
And we knew these mushrooms are gonna 
hit soon.

4156
02:48:50,341 --> 02:48:52,600
So we're just like,
but we didn't feel it.

4157
02:48:52,601 --> 02:48:53,710
We're like,
the mushrooms ain't hit.

4158
02:48:53,711 --> 02:48:54,700
We just ate it like,
you know,

4159
02:48:54,701 --> 02:48:55,280
five,
10,

4160
02:48:55,390 --> 02:48:56,050
whatever,
you know.

4161
02:48:56,051 --> 02:48:59,380
And it hadn't hit,
walked around the corner and there was a

4162
02:48:59,381 --> 02:49:00,790
police station were like,
Oh shit,

4163
02:49:00,791 --> 02:49:04,270
like I guess we should ask them.
And we went in there and we're like,

4164
02:49:04,580 --> 02:49:06,250
we don't know what happened or a 
friendly,

4165
02:49:06,251 --> 02:49:09,270
we don't know if he got or whatever.
And we're like,

4166
02:49:09,271 --> 02:49:12,900
he looks like this.
And so there's this long alleyway,

4167
02:49:12,901 --> 02:49:16,710
right?
And this motherfucker chose the one spot

4168
02:49:16,711 --> 02:49:21,711
to piss where apparently there was like 
a secret door that opened inward into 

4169
02:49:21,711 --> 02:49:25,260
the police station and there was a 
camera facing down and he was pissing on

4170
02:49:25,261 --> 02:49:25,650
the door.

4171
02:49:25,650 --> 02:49:30,650
The police station,
they grabbed a mid pissed stick still 

4172
02:49:30,650 --> 02:49:33,030
out in the fucking police station and 
throw them in jail.

4173
02:49:34,180 --> 02:49:35,910
And it's.
So we get this information,

4174
02:49:35,911 --> 02:49:36,970
we're like,
oh fuck,

4175
02:49:36,971 --> 02:49:39,090
like what do we gotta do?
Like we got to pay this guy,

4176
02:49:39,091 --> 02:49:41,580
like we're like,
this dude never done mushrooms before.

4177
02:49:41,581 --> 02:49:44,280
His first experience,
he's going to be in a jail in Amsterdam.

4178
02:49:44,281 --> 02:49:46,260
This guy's my gonna fucking lose his 
mind.

4179
02:49:46,530 --> 02:49:51,530
Like we gotta get them out.
So we ended up paying these people and 

4180
02:49:51,530 --> 02:49:51,530
then like,
I forget,

4181
02:49:51,530 --> 02:49:52,980
we've got to pay them a lot because I 
was in college.

4182
02:49:52,981 --> 02:49:55,350
I remember it was like a significant 
amount of money for us,

4183
02:49:55,620 --> 02:49:57,660
but we bailed them out.
And then I ended up.

4184
02:49:57,900 --> 02:50:00,810
I remember I offered like the chicken,
the counter.

4185
02:50:00,811 --> 02:50:05,811
I was like,
I'll give you 100 bucks if you'll mail 

4186
02:50:05,811 --> 02:50:07,671
this to his parents or the video of 
pissing and getting arrested if you met 

4187
02:50:07,671 --> 02:50:08,950
his parents,
get the fuck out.

4188
02:50:10,670 --> 02:50:14,370
So that was number three.
And then the fourth time I did it,

4189
02:50:14,371 --> 02:50:15,160
I was in,
um,

4190
02:50:15,210 --> 02:50:17,790
it was that trip that I took to Puerto 
Vallarta.

4191
02:50:18,570 --> 02:50:20,340
And uh,
when I took my buddy that one,

4192
02:50:20,341 --> 02:50:23,490
the or he got second in the world series
of poker and I,

4193
02:50:23,550 --> 02:50:25,680
and I'll never forget it because I was 
um,

4194
02:50:26,670 --> 02:50:28,710
I was downstairs and we had this,
this,

4195
02:50:28,730 --> 02:50:33,730
this big villa on the edge of a cliff 
and I remember not wanting to have sex 

4196
02:50:35,760 --> 02:50:38,790
and I was just like,
this is the greatest thing for the first

4197
02:50:38,791 --> 02:50:40,800
time.
Like my Dick doesn't control me.

4198
02:50:41,060 --> 02:50:43,290
Like I like this is so,
you know,

4199
02:50:43,291 --> 02:50:48,291
this is so nice to just be able to like 
relax and not like because we had all 

4200
02:50:48,291 --> 02:50:52,791
these chicks running around.
I was like banging on the whole weekend 

4201
02:50:52,791 --> 02:50:54,921
and I was like,
just not even like half to like think 

4202
02:50:54,921 --> 02:50:54,921
about it because I have no desire to 
have sex right now.

4203
02:50:54,921 --> 02:50:56,310
I remember having that thought and being
like,

4204
02:50:56,311 --> 02:51:01,311
wow,
this is great and I'm so fucked up that 

4205
02:51:01,311 --> 02:51:04,110
I like took that as a personal challenge
to like see if I can have sex.

4206
02:51:04,790 --> 02:51:08,900
I'm fucking this girl for like 40 
minutes on mushrooms on mushrooms.

4207
02:51:08,940 --> 02:51:11,280
It was the craziest bucket experience 
ever.

4208
02:51:11,790 --> 02:51:16,790
I didn't even really enjoy it that much.
But I just remember at the end of it I 

4209
02:51:16,790 --> 02:51:16,790
was like,
wow,

4210
02:51:16,790 --> 02:51:21,621
like you had this opportunity where like
you were not consumed with wanting to 

4211
02:51:21,621 --> 02:51:25,401
have sex and he could put the fucking 
ruined it foot.

4212
02:51:27,750 --> 02:51:29,400
Um,
I had a mushroom trip.

4213
02:51:29,401 --> 02:51:30,280
I was,
um,

4214
02:51:30,630 --> 02:51:33,810
I was with my friend Eddie and we were 
near a mountain.

4215
02:51:34,020 --> 02:51:37,830
It was a very high hill.
We were below it and we were laying down

4216
02:51:37,831 --> 02:51:42,300
in the grass just laughing and giggling 
and I don't know if you've ever,

4217
02:51:42,301 --> 02:51:47,301
like,
if you've ever been like lying down 

4218
02:51:47,301 --> 02:51:50,430
looking up at a mountain range and you 
see the sky and the clouds go overhead.

4219
02:51:50,970 --> 02:51:55,970
It was the first time,
I think in my life that I really took in

4220
02:51:57,330 --> 02:52:02,330
the concept of an atmosphere of this 
shape of the earth being round and that 

4221
02:52:03,510 --> 02:52:06,180
behind that atmosphere,
I'm to look it up as blue sky.

4222
02:52:06,181 --> 02:52:08,590
It's beautiful.
But I didn't see the blue sky anymore.

4223
02:52:08,591 --> 02:52:09,880
Saw it.
I knew it was there,

4224
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:12,370
but I realized that it's just this 
layer.

4225
02:52:12,610 --> 02:52:17,020
And then beyond that is the vast 
infinity of space.

4226
02:52:17,350 --> 02:52:22,350
And I remember looking at it and 
thinking for the first time because of 

4227
02:52:22,350 --> 02:52:22,570
this hill I could see like,
oh,

4228
02:52:22,571 --> 02:52:24,820
like oh my God,
we're like in a convertible spaceship.

4229
02:52:25,120 --> 02:52:27,520
Like this whole thing is a space ship.
Like this is an illusion.

4230
02:52:27,720 --> 02:52:28,290
We're,
we're,

4231
02:52:28,291 --> 02:52:30,340
we're standing here like we're on 
ground,

4232
02:52:30,341 --> 02:52:32,950
we're laying down on the grass looking 
up at the sky,

4233
02:52:33,370 --> 02:52:35,620
but this is not,
this is not sky,

4234
02:52:35,621 --> 02:52:40,621
this is a thin layer of atmosphere 
that's protecting you from space.

4235
02:52:41,350 --> 02:52:44,830
And then above that is there's no end to
it.

4236
02:52:44,890 --> 02:52:49,890
And it fucking stuck in my head.
That idea for the very first time.

4237
02:52:50,830 --> 02:52:55,830
And it's something about being below a 
mountain and laying down and looking up 

4238
02:52:55,830 --> 02:52:59,880
and seeing them out and seeing the air 
and seeing the clouds go where it just 

4239
02:52:59,880 --> 02:53:00,850
said into my mind like,
well that's an atmosphere.

4240
02:53:01,550 --> 02:53:03,790
This isn't just the sky,
this is a.

4241
02:53:04,590 --> 02:53:06,760
So I,
from that moment on,

4242
02:53:06,761 --> 02:53:10,240
I can look up at a mountain now and I'll
get this weird,

4243
02:53:10,241 --> 02:53:15,241
almost like half trippy feeling that.
That's one thing that I've heard 

4244
02:53:15,241 --> 02:53:17,600
actually about a lot of psychedelics is 
that it is not like,

4245
02:53:17,601 --> 02:53:22,601
it doesn't like rewire you,
but it just makes you think about 

4246
02:53:22,601 --> 02:53:23,800
certain things differently and I think 
that they,

4247
02:53:23,920 --> 02:53:28,920
they explained that there's some 
chemical thing or kind of like almost 

4248
02:53:28,920 --> 02:53:33,271
like resets you to like where you can 
have a new perspective on certain 

4249
02:53:33,271 --> 02:53:33,480
things.
That's one of the things that I read.

4250
02:53:33,520 --> 02:53:36,220
I was considering doing acid at burning 
man this last year,

4251
02:53:36,510 --> 02:53:41,510
um,
because I've heard from a lot of people 

4252
02:53:41,510 --> 02:53:43,891
that it's like,
it's more like clean form of the 

4253
02:53:43,891 --> 02:53:48,111
mushrooms and they kinda like got more 
out of it and I had like 10 people tell 

4254
02:53:48,111 --> 02:53:49,600
me that it was like the best experience 
or life.

4255
02:53:49,600 --> 02:53:52,720
And so that's like a pretty strong 
statement of 10 people tell you that.

4256
02:53:52,721 --> 02:53:55,420
So yeah,
I did it this year for the first time.

4257
02:53:55,520 --> 02:53:58,750
It's a,
I wouldn't say it's like a,

4258
02:53:58,990 --> 02:54:00,070
it's,
it's powerful.

4259
02:54:00,130 --> 02:54:05,130
I mean they're all amazing.
They all have their own little thing 

4260
02:54:05,130 --> 02:54:05,130
that goes on with them.
But the um,

4261
02:54:05,130 --> 02:54:10,050
the changing of perspective is really 
beneficial to people that have 

4262
02:54:10,050 --> 02:54:13,231
addictions.
Like apparently people that smoke 

4263
02:54:13,231 --> 02:54:15,301
cigarettes,
like they'll have a powerful mushroom 

4264
02:54:15,301 --> 02:54:15,301
trip and they don't have any desire to 
smoke cigarettes anymore.

4265
02:54:15,301 --> 02:54:18,610
It's a really common experience.
Drug addicts and you know,

4266
02:54:18,611 --> 02:54:23,611
even people that probably have other 
weird addictions like gambling 

4267
02:54:23,611 --> 02:54:23,611
addictions or sex addictions like,
yeah.

4268
02:54:23,910 --> 02:54:28,910
Like I said,
I think I had a small experience like 

4269
02:54:28,910 --> 02:54:31,330
that with the sex thing on the mushrooms
and it was pretty liberating.

4270
02:54:31,840 --> 02:54:36,840
Yeah.
I mean I think for a lot of people they 

4271
02:54:36,840 --> 02:54:36,840
get trapped in the momentum of the life 
that they're in,

4272
02:54:37,160 --> 02:54:42,160
whatever it is.
And sometimes psychedelic trips or you 

4273
02:54:42,160 --> 02:54:46,621
know,
sometimes for people it's just a near 

4274
02:54:46,621 --> 02:54:46,621
death experience.
You almost drowned.

4275
02:54:46,621 --> 02:54:46,621
You don't drown.
You get out of there and you're like,

4276
02:54:46,621 --> 02:54:48,010
Holy Shit,
I got to rethink my whole life.

4277
02:54:48,370 --> 02:54:51,940
And he just just changes who you are.
Like the reset.

4278
02:54:52,650 --> 02:54:53,270
Yeah.
I mean,

4279
02:54:53,271 --> 02:54:55,660
I,
and I've preached this for a long time.

4280
02:54:55,661 --> 02:54:58,750
I think just so much of your life is 
just perspective.

4281
02:54:58,751 --> 02:54:59,740
I mean,
it really is.

4282
02:54:59,741 --> 02:55:00,480
And I,
I,

4283
02:55:00,481 --> 02:55:01,900
you know,
a lot of times I have these,

4284
02:55:01,901 --> 02:55:04,000
um,
these crazy part is on

4285
02:55:04,050 --> 02:55:06,870
white disabled veterans out or whatever 
and try and show them a good time.

4286
02:55:06,871 --> 02:55:08,480
And it's one time I,
uh,

4287
02:55:08,610 --> 02:55:13,610
had this one guy who got both his legs 
blown off in Afghanistan and super cool 

4288
02:55:13,610 --> 02:55:14,360
dude,
like really humble,

4289
02:55:14,361 --> 02:55:16,000
nice guy.
And um,

4290
02:55:16,340 --> 02:55:19,030
there's this like super hot chick that 
was at the,

4291
02:55:19,050 --> 02:55:20,690
at the party and I really wanted to fuck
her,

4292
02:55:20,691 --> 02:55:21,520
but I was like,
ah,

4293
02:55:21,560 --> 02:55:23,990
see if she can get her to fuck him.
And uh,

4294
02:55:23,991 --> 02:55:25,850
I,
I paid her a fucking ton of money,

4295
02:55:25,851 --> 02:55:29,330
which is kind of fucked,
fuck this guy.

4296
02:55:30,010 --> 02:55:30,740
And uh,
and I,

4297
02:55:30,741 --> 02:55:35,741
I was,
I was fucked up and I ended up passing 

4298
02:55:35,741 --> 02:55:37,961
out and I forgot about it.
And the next day we're sitting there at 

4299
02:55:37,961 --> 02:55:37,961
breakfast and um,
I was just like,

4300
02:55:37,961 --> 02:55:42,801
I'm so fucking miserable.
And I look over at this dude and almost 

4301
02:55:42,801 --> 02:55:42,801
like,
you know,

4302
02:55:42,801 --> 02:55:42,830
like,
what the fuck are you so happy.

4303
02:55:42,850 --> 02:55:45,370
He's like,
smiling and eat this shit and you know,

4304
02:55:45,380 --> 02:55:46,250
I'm hung over.
I'm like,

4305
02:55:46,251 --> 02:55:48,290
what the fuck are you so happy about?
You know,

4306
02:55:48,710 --> 02:55:49,580
he's like,
he's like,

4307
02:55:49,581 --> 02:55:50,360
shit man.
He's like,

4308
02:55:50,361 --> 02:55:51,710
I feel great.
Oh,

4309
02:55:51,711 --> 02:55:52,880
you're not hung over.
He's like,

4310
02:55:52,881 --> 02:55:53,270
yeah.
He's like,

4311
02:55:53,271 --> 02:55:55,370
I don't give a shit though.
And uh,

4312
02:55:55,460 --> 02:55:56,210
and I'm just like,
dude,

4313
02:55:56,211 --> 02:55:57,500
I got to ask you man.
I'm like,

4314
02:55:57,501 --> 02:55:59,450
he got you got the fucking best 
attitude.

4315
02:55:59,451 --> 02:56:04,451
I was like,
since you've been here has always been 

4316
02:56:04,451 --> 02:56:04,451
fucking positive.
I was like,

4317
02:56:04,451 --> 02:56:04,490
you know,
is it ever like,

4318
02:56:04,610 --> 02:56:09,610
you know,
do you ever have moments where you're 

4319
02:56:09,610 --> 02:56:09,610
just like fucking depressed about,
you know,

4320
02:56:09,610 --> 02:56:14,111
the,
the fucking amputation or any of that 

4321
02:56:14,111 --> 02:56:14,111
stuff was exact fuck with you.
I was like,

4322
02:56:14,111 --> 02:56:14,480
how do you like,
how do you maintain such a good attitude

4323
02:56:14,481 --> 02:56:16,430
as I think it's amazing.
And he's like,

4324
02:56:16,431 --> 02:56:17,160
what are you talking about?

4325
02:56:17,160 --> 02:56:18,060
I was like,
losing my legs.

4326
02:56:18,110 --> 02:56:23,110
The best thing that ever happened to me 
and I'll just never forget it because 

4327
02:56:23,110 --> 02:56:23,390
that statement was just like,
so,

4328
02:56:23,391 --> 02:56:27,230
like different from what I ever expected
this guy to say.

4329
02:56:27,231 --> 02:56:29,090
Right.
And he followed it up with,

4330
02:56:29,330 --> 02:56:30,710
you know,
if that never happened to me,

4331
02:56:30,711 --> 02:56:32,950
he's like,
I'd be over in fucking some sand pit and

4332
02:56:32,951 --> 02:56:37,951
Afghanistan,
I'd just be another number and nobody 

4333
02:56:37,951 --> 02:56:37,951
gives a shit about me.
He goes,

4334
02:56:37,951 --> 02:56:38,450
and then when I came home he's like,
I just be,

4335
02:56:38,860 --> 02:56:41,480
you know,
fucking military guy and everybody in my

4336
02:56:41,481 --> 02:56:43,400
town wouldn't care.
And he's like,

4337
02:56:43,401 --> 02:56:48,401
now he's like,
I go and I motivate people and I give 

4338
02:56:48,401 --> 02:56:49,130
these speeches.
He goes and people look up to me and I'm

4339
02:56:49,131 --> 02:56:50,420
inspiring people.
He's like,

4340
02:56:50,421 --> 02:56:53,450
and I get to do cool shit.
I just got a fucking brand new rifle the

4341
02:56:53,451 --> 02:56:54,500
other week for free.

4342
02:56:54,780 --> 02:56:56,630
He goes to military is paying me.
He goes,

4343
02:56:56,631 --> 02:57:00,290
I'm fucking party in here with you 
fucked a super hot chick class.

4344
02:57:00,291 --> 02:57:01,310
I know that.
I remembered.

4345
02:57:01,311 --> 02:57:01,910
I was like,
oh good.

4346
02:57:02,460 --> 02:57:07,460
And then it was just like funny though 
because like his whole thought process 

4347
02:57:07,911 --> 02:57:12,440
about it was so great and I could just 
see how another guy,

4348
02:57:12,441 --> 02:57:17,441
if that happened to them,
could easily like get into like the woe 

4349
02:57:17,441 --> 02:57:17,441
is me and the whole like,
you know,

4350
02:57:17,441 --> 02:57:17,860
fuck this,
you know,

4351
02:57:17,930 --> 02:57:18,920
depressed and,
you know,

4352
02:57:18,921 --> 02:57:21,080
think about all the time,
like how could this have gone,

4353
02:57:21,140 --> 02:57:23,690
you know,
but this guy just like accepted it,

4354
02:57:23,750 --> 02:57:26,300
fucking charge with it.
And I was just like,

4355
02:57:26,750 --> 02:57:30,980
he viewed it as like a huge positive.
And I thought that was great.

4356
02:57:31,050 --> 02:57:32,660
I don't know if you've ever seen,
um,

4357
02:57:33,470 --> 02:57:38,470
I got this youtube thing.
It's like the story of the Chinese 

4358
02:57:38,470 --> 02:57:38,470
farmer.

4359
02:57:38,470 --> 02:57:38,470
You ever seen that?
No,

4360
02:57:38,470 --> 02:57:42,400
we're.
So he loses his horse and everybody in 

4361
02:57:42,400 --> 02:57:42,400
the town comes over and they say,
oh,

4362
02:57:42,400 --> 02:57:43,430
well that's,
that's terrible.

4363
02:57:43,460 --> 02:57:44,470
And he's like,
I'm.

4364
02:57:45,230 --> 02:57:46,160
And they're like,
oh,

4365
02:57:46,161 --> 02:57:47,570
well that's terrible now,
isn't it?

4366
02:57:47,630 --> 02:57:49,190
And he's like,
maybe.

4367
02:57:49,730 --> 02:57:54,730
And then the next day seven wild horses 
come back and they all come over and 

4368
02:57:54,730 --> 02:57:54,730
they say,
oh,

4369
02:57:54,730 --> 02:57:55,970
well that's great.
And he says,

4370
02:57:55,971 --> 02:57:58,820
well,
maybe the next day his kid is taken out,

4371
02:57:58,821 --> 02:58:03,821
one of the wild horses and breaks his 
leg and the whole town comes over and 

4372
02:58:03,821 --> 02:58:03,821
they say,
oh,

4373
02:58:03,821 --> 02:58:03,821
that's terrible.
Now in it.

4374
02:58:04,230 --> 02:58:09,230
He says,
maybe the next day the conscription 

4375
02:58:09,230 --> 02:58:09,630
officers come over and they're,
you know,

4376
02:58:09,840 --> 02:58:14,840
taking people into the military to go 
fight and they pass by his son because 

4377
02:58:14,840 --> 02:58:15,810
he's got a broken leg and the whole town
comes over and they say,

4378
02:58:15,930 --> 02:58:16,620
you know,
and they say,

4379
02:58:16,621 --> 02:58:17,490
oh,
that's great now.

4380
02:58:17,490 --> 02:58:18,510
And then he says,
maybe.

4381
02:58:19,170 --> 02:58:24,170
And the point of it is that you never 
really know if something is bad or good 

4382
02:58:25,111 --> 02:58:29,100
because you don't know how that's gonna 
affect the rest of your life.

4383
02:58:29,101 --> 02:58:30,190
Like back,
you know,

4384
02:58:30,270 --> 02:58:33,570
when I fuck up two days before graduated
seal training,

4385
02:58:33,571 --> 02:58:38,571
I've done 510 days of it.
I'll put my fucking heart and soul into 

4386
02:58:38,571 --> 02:58:42,081
this fucking thing and I get kicked out 
because some fucking guy doesn't like 

4387
02:58:42,081 --> 02:58:42,510
me.
And you know,

4388
02:58:42,511 --> 02:58:44,850
it's kind kinda hard to look at that in 
any way other than,

4389
02:58:44,880 --> 02:58:46,320
oh,
that's fucking terrible.

4390
02:58:46,650 --> 02:58:49,170
But as I'm older and I've experienced a 
lot,

4391
02:58:49,171 --> 02:58:50,640
I can look at that and be like,
well,

4392
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:55,140
half of my class died right in combat so
I could have fucking died.

4393
02:58:55,550 --> 02:58:58,260
Um,
if I would have became a navy seal,

4394
02:58:58,261 --> 02:59:00,960
then that might've just been like what I
hung my hat on,

4395
02:59:00,961 --> 02:59:01,860
you know,
and I was just like,

4396
02:59:01,861 --> 02:59:06,861
for the rest of my life I didn't feel 
like I really needed to fucking prove 

4397
02:59:06,861 --> 02:59:08,440
anything or excel or do anything because
I've done this thing that everybody uses

4398
02:59:08,460 --> 02:59:11,370
great.
And you know,

4399
02:59:11,410 --> 02:59:13,560
I don't know if I would've been as 
motivated.

4400
02:59:13,740 --> 02:59:18,740
And so there's just a lot of things like
that and your life that in the short 

4401
02:59:18,740 --> 02:59:21,400
term you look at them as being extreme 
negatives or you know,

4402
02:59:21,560 --> 02:59:23,430
something that you view as positive 
that,

4403
02:59:23,431 --> 02:59:25,530
you know,
it's just hard to say until,

4404
02:59:25,830 --> 02:59:30,830
you know,
it's Kinda like run its course and you 

4405
02:59:30,830 --> 02:59:30,830
see what effects that has later on down 
the line.

4406
02:59:31,410 --> 02:59:32,940
We're going to end it with some deep 
shit.

4407
02:59:32,980 --> 02:59:37,980
Dan Bilzerian,
I knew I'd get some deep shit out of 

4408
02:59:37,980 --> 02:59:37,980
you.
I knew it was in there.

4409
02:59:37,980 --> 02:59:38,350
God Damn it.
Thank you very much,

4410
02:59:38,351 --> 02:59:39,320
man.
I really appreciate it.

4411
02:59:39,330 --> 02:59:41,170
It was a lot of fun.
Really appreciate it.

4412
02:59:41,420 --> 02:59:43,540
Uh,
obviously instagram.

4413
02:59:43,541 --> 02:59:45,160
Then twitter,
the same.

4414
02:59:45,161 --> 02:59:46,660
Right?
Thanks brother.

4415
02:59:46,690 --> 02:59:48,730
That was fun.
Good Times night everybody.

4416
02:59:48,940 --> 02:59:53,940
Oh,
we'll be back tomorrow with Jesse 

4417
02:59:53,940 --> 02:59:53,940

Holy Shit.

4418
02:59:53,940 --> 02:59:53,950
Cool.
