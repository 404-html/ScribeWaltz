Joe Rogan podcast by night.

All Day.

Back for round two.

6
00:00:17,981 --> 00:00:18,850
Ladies and gentlemen,

7
00:00:18,851 --> 00:00:20,170
we're here with Randall Park.

8
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:20,520
Wait,

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:20,711
none.

10
00:00:20,711 --> 00:00:21,700
Eddie Wong,

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,070
he's stuck in traffic
coming over to Panga.

12
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,510
Probably Dodge and hippies.

13
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,450
You ever take that ride over to Panga?

14
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:28,100
Oh yeah.

15
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,940
Pass by those fucking
weird organic people.

16
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,650
I pass by a guy with a sign.

17
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:33,480
A lot of,

18
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,313
a lot of hemp.

19
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,590
I know a lot of beads.

20
00:00:35,591 --> 00:00:40,591
Let a dirty feet a pass by a guy who
had a sign that said Vegan Gardner.

21
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:42,940
Like what does that mean?

22
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,050
Like what?

23
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:44,171
No,

24
00:00:44,171 --> 00:00:45,220
it wasn't Vegan Gardener.

25
00:00:45,221 --> 00:00:46,480
It was Vegan landscaping.

26
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:47,170
That's what it was.

27
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:48,003
I was like,

28
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,650
what the fuck does that even mean?

29
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,790
I just wanted to hit him.

30
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,780
Just want to fucking have
bears chase him or something.

31
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,330
Son of a bitch ran a park.

32
00:00:58,331 --> 00:00:59,490
Ladies and gentleman happened and yeah.

33
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:00,190
Good to see you brother.

34
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:00,851
Good to see you,

35
00:01:00,851 --> 00:01:01,061
man.

36
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:01,940
Thanks for coming on here.

37
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:02,561
I appreciate it.

38
00:01:02,561 --> 00:01:02,790
Yeah,

39
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:03,190
sure.

40
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,570
You are in the middle of the,

41
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:08,200
one of the most controversial
movies in the history of the world.

42
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:08,560
Yeah.

43
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,040
Yeah.

44
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,581
You are.

45
00:01:09,581 --> 00:01:10,330
You play?

46
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:11,440
I play Kim Jong owner.

47
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:11,831
Yeah,

48
00:01:11,831 --> 00:01:12,670
in the interview,

49
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,320
which is fucking crazy,

50
00:01:14,321 --> 00:01:15,154
man.

51
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,170
I didn't think it was crazy when I
signed on I realized it was crazy.

52
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,370
You know,

53
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:22,660
in the midst of all that,

54
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,360
what is the verdict?

55
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,110
Because they say that it's not,

56
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:27,640
it's not North Korea.

57
00:01:27,641 --> 00:01:29,500
Someone was saying it
was an insider at Sony.

58
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:30,483
They had it.

59
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:34,060
They had it narrowed down
to a woman who hacked it.

60
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,420
Right.

61
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,500
That you know,

62
00:01:35,501 --> 00:01:36,250
I don't know.

63
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:36,791
I don't know.

64
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:38,170
Cause after they came out with that,

65
00:01:38,171 --> 00:01:39,760
the FBI came out and said,

66
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:40,151
no,

67
00:01:40,151 --> 00:01:41,410
it is North Korea.

68
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:46,650
We have a lot of information that we
haven't released but it is trust us.

69
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:48,780
But then you know the,

70
00:01:48,781 --> 00:01:53,781
the private kind of security experts
still think it's not North Korea.

71
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:58,210
I would almost always go with private
security experts over the FBI.

72
00:01:58,330 --> 00:01:59,670
Almost always I am.

73
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:03,610
I kind of feel like most
people now what also,

74
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,140
which is kind of sad,

75
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,910
that's sad for the FBI,

76
00:02:06,911 --> 00:02:08,680
but I think most people
are questioning it.

77
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,860
W W would you be willing to go
over there ever one I ever do.

78
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,160
You mean like,

79
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,040
do you mean North Korea specifically?

80
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,290
Do you mean Oh yes,

81
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,230
very specific.

82
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,583
No,

83
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,780
not go over there.

84
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,140
I would never go with it.

85
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,570
Especially if you went over there
under the guidance of Dennis Rodman.

86
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,820
No,

87
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,150
no.

88
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:31,551
I,

89
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:34,070
I would say I wouldn't go near Dennis Rod

90
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,911
in America.

91
00:02:36,911 --> 00:02:37,960
I would not go near him,

92
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:41,170
but I would not go near
North Korea at all.

93
00:02:41,171 --> 00:02:41,800
I mean,

94
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,800
if the regime topples and changes and uh,

95
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,173
you know,

96
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,710
I don't know 20 years from now,

97
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,030
what's the likelihood of that though?

98
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,661
I don't know.

99
00:02:52,661 --> 00:02:53,020
I don't,

100
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:53,620
I don't think it's fine.

101
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,490
I think it's possible,

102
00:02:54,491 --> 00:02:56,230
but in our lifetimes I think,

103
00:02:56,231 --> 00:02:57,730
but uh,

104
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,091
yeah,

105
00:02:58,091 --> 00:02:59,050
that's the only way I'd,

106
00:02:59,550 --> 00:02:59,700
well,

107
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,190
we were talking

108
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,930
about this before the
podcast started there.

109
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,380
They exchange flashdrives yeah.

110
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,580
Back and forth to each other.

111
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:06,991
Yeah.

112
00:03:06,991 --> 00:03:07,980
Like in the eye,

113
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,180
a huge part of

114
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,140
the underground economy there is,

115
00:03:13,141 --> 00:03:15,930
is basically these flash drives with,

116
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,480
with South Korean TV shows,

117
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,291
movies,

118
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:20,460
American movies,

119
00:03:20,461 --> 00:03:20,731
you know,

120
00:03:20,731 --> 00:03:25,380
just glimpses into the outside world
that they're not supposed to see.

121
00:03:25,381 --> 00:03:27,120
It's a huge underground market.

122
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,820
So I think the people there,

123
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:32,490
especially the younger people
that they know what's going on,

124
00:03:32,491 --> 00:03:33,030
you know,

125
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,110
and if they get caught,

126
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:35,940
not only they fucked.

127
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:36,863
Yeah.

128
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,620
Well this is what I read and
I don't know how it is now.

129
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:42,930
It might be even worse now for all I know.

130
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:43,291
But yeah,

131
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:44,220
if they get caught,

132
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,640
they go to a labor camp for,

133
00:03:47,641 --> 00:03:49,570
I don't know how long that,

134
00:03:49,571 --> 00:03:51,330
it's like a three generational thing.

135
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:52,200
There they are,

136
00:03:52,201 --> 00:03:55,620
kids go to a labor camp there
and their parents will go.

137
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:00,000
Like the whole family ends up
being punished for their action,

138
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,650
which is wild.

139
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:02,893
It's insane.

140
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,290
Yeah.

141
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:03,561
And when,

142
00:04:03,561 --> 00:04:06,410
when we hear about like
dictatorships like that,

143
00:04:06,411 --> 00:04:08,870
we always think of it like if that's
from like the forties like you know,

144
00:04:08,871 --> 00:04:10,400
you think of it as he is,

145
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,050
it is from the forties that's a thing.

146
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:15,020
And it just has not changed over there.

147
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:15,800
Yeah.

148
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,920
I just wonder what it would take for
something like that to be toppled.

149
00:04:18,921 --> 00:04:21,770
And we were also talking before the
podcast started about his uncle,

150
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,370
but his uncle apparently was
planning some sort of a coup,

151
00:04:24,371 --> 00:04:25,160
so yeah.

152
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,060
Killed his uncle.

153
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,110
Killed his uncle's son.

154
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:27,690
Yeah.

155
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:28,081
Yeah.

156
00:04:28,081 --> 00:04:28,471
I mean,

157
00:04:28,471 --> 00:04:28,651
well,

158
00:04:28,651 --> 00:04:30,000
one thing that happened when our,

159
00:04:30,001 --> 00:04:34,320
when our movie was about to come
out there was like a some expert on,

160
00:04:34,321 --> 00:04:39,321
on North Korea who said
that it's important that the
elite in Pyongyang see this

161
00:04:40,081 --> 00:04:40,650
movie,

162
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,020
especially the people in the,

163
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:43,531
the,

164
00:04:43,531 --> 00:04:43,861
you know,

165
00:04:43,861 --> 00:04:46,860
the government and it
working it because it's so,

166
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:51,090
it's so they're on such shaky ground
right now that for them to see something

167
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:56,091
like this could like really help in
getting something to happen over there.

168
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,321
This is what Sony,

169
00:04:57,321 --> 00:04:57,781
you were saying?

170
00:04:57,781 --> 00:04:57,991
No,

171
00:04:57,991 --> 00:04:58,171
no.

172
00:04:58,171 --> 00:04:58,761
This was like a,

173
00:04:58,761 --> 00:04:59,640
an expert on it.

174
00:04:59,641 --> 00:05:02,130
Like some professor or
something on North Korea,

175
00:05:02,131 --> 00:05:03,480
which I thought was interesting.

176
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,620
But yeah,

177
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,473
I,

178
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,310
that kind of blew my
mind when he said that.

179
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,260
Wow,

180
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:09,741
that's great.

181
00:05:09,741 --> 00:05:10,580
Imagine if it did.

182
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:11,960
Imagine if that was the catalyst.

183
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:14,380
If hours are ridiculous comedy,

184
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,260
Seth Rogan,

185
00:05:15,261 --> 00:05:20,261
James Franco movie catalyst
for overthrowing the last
great communist dictator.

186
00:05:21,991 --> 00:05:22,350
Yeah,

187
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,090
yeah.

188
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,370
I mean school communist dictatorship.

189
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,441
That's crazy.

190
00:05:26,441 --> 00:05:27,161
I mean it's all,

191
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:27,521
you know,

192
00:05:27,521 --> 00:05:28,580
as so much of it is,

193
00:05:28,581 --> 00:05:28,841
is,

194
00:05:28,841 --> 00:05:32,470
is this kind of deification you know,

195
00:05:32,471 --> 00:05:34,060
of him and,

196
00:05:34,061 --> 00:05:34,894
uh,

197
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,280
all of this stuff,

198
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:36,581
you know,

199
00:05:36,581 --> 00:05:37,151
our movie,

200
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,050
but not just that,

201
00:05:38,051 --> 00:05:40,210
even just glimpses into the outside world.

202
00:05:40,211 --> 00:05:41,890
It just chips away at that,

203
00:05:41,891 --> 00:05:42,221
you know,

204
00:05:42,221 --> 00:05:45,070
and he becomes who he is,

205
00:05:45,071 --> 00:05:45,341
you know,

206
00:05:45,341 --> 00:05:48,070
to these people and to
other people and you know,

207
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,191
in the government and,

208
00:05:49,191 --> 00:05:49,441
and,

209
00:05:49,441 --> 00:05:52,300
and that does not help their cause,

210
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:53,020
you know,

211
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,900
or the government or Kim
Jong Un's cause you know,

212
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,770
what is the Dennis Rodman thing?

213
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:58,723
What's,

214
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:01,450
did you research him at
all when you did this?

215
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:02,281
I did,

216
00:06:02,281 --> 00:06:02,671
yeah.

217
00:06:02,671 --> 00:06:03,504
I mean,

218
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:09,750
Kim Jong Moon include an his father
Kim Jong Il when he was alive.

219
00:06:09,931 --> 00:06:11,460
Huge NBA fans.

220
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,920
He was a huge basket fall ball fan.

221
00:06:13,921 --> 00:06:16,920
He was like a loved Michael Jordan.

222
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,150
And there's a story of,

223
00:06:18,151 --> 00:06:18,961
of Kim Jong who,

224
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,100
and supposedly he was a,

225
00:06:20,101 --> 00:06:21,270
when he was a student,

226
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,820
he went to like an international
school in Switzerland.

227
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:24,781
And uh,

228
00:06:24,781 --> 00:06:28,050
there are accounts of
him from other students.

229
00:06:28,051 --> 00:06:32,130
He just sit in class all day and draw
doodle pictures of Michael Jordan.

230
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,121
Like,

231
00:06:33,121 --> 00:06:34,590
literally in this class.

232
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:38,940
So like he was obsessed with
basketball and in that era,

233
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:39,511
and I think,

234
00:06:39,511 --> 00:06:40,140
you know,

235
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,960
that bowls team was
running things at the time,

236
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,490
like rotten just to,

237
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,050
he was a huge rod and fan.

238
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:46,830
Wow.

239
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:47,663
Yeah.

240
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,540
Crazy.

241
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,351
It's so crazy.

242
00:06:49,351 --> 00:06:52,320
See Rodman over there hanging
out with them as so surreal.

243
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:55,650
So did you see that at
that press conference?

244
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,553
No,

245
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:00,060
there's a video of like a press conference
where he's basically sitting there

246
00:07:00,061 --> 00:07:00,320
with,

247
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:05,160
with the other play at some other players
who went with him on this trip and

248
00:07:05,161 --> 00:07:06,660
he's clearly drunk

249
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,380
and he's basically justifying his,

250
00:07:10,381 --> 00:07:11,214
you know,

251
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,200
his actions by going over there and,

252
00:07:13,201 --> 00:07:14,034
and you know,

253
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:17,760
becoming friends with this guy and
he's like drunk and this is a press

254
00:07:17,761 --> 00:07:19,530
conference from Korea or from America,

255
00:07:19,531 --> 00:07:23,580
I think it was in Korea that they shot
that they shot it and you could see the

256
00:07:23,581 --> 00:07:26,490
players behind him and they
just look super uncomfortable

257
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:28,980
going around like,

258
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:29,161
well,

259
00:07:29,161 --> 00:07:31,020
how could you not be super
uncomfortable first of all,

260
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,170
hanging out with Dennis Rodman
and make you super uncomfortable.

261
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,690
Dennis Rodman calling a press conference.

262
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,351
Yeah,

263
00:07:37,351 --> 00:07:38,020
yeah,

264
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:38,490
yeah.

265
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:39,040
I mean,

266
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,371
yeah.

267
00:07:39,371 --> 00:07:39,690
Yeah.

268
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,170
Is it the top one or the,

269
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:41,981
yeah,

270
00:07:41,981 --> 00:07:42,814
that top one.

271
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:47,440
[inaudible] worth,

272
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,753
man,

273
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,351
this is la.

274
00:07:50,351 --> 00:07:51,550
The traffic is insane.

275
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:52,630
Also fucking,

276
00:07:52,631 --> 00:07:55,780
I'm an idiot that lost my car
in a fucking parking garage.

277
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,600
Did you,

278
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,810
you meant I was running up and down.

279
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,840
Were you like along third street?

280
00:08:01,841 --> 00:08:05,860
Like one of those garages like the
prominent and they got three garages that

281
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:08,770
look the same and I was
running up and down.

282
00:08:08,771 --> 00:08:08,981
I'm like,

283
00:08:08,981 --> 00:08:10,220
where the fuck is my car?

284
00:08:10,221 --> 00:08:11,860
It was right here and then they were like,

285
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,101
you know,

286
00:08:12,101 --> 00:08:13,270
there's another parking garage.

287
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,091
My bad dude.

288
00:08:16,091 --> 00:08:16,930
No worries man.

289
00:08:16,931 --> 00:08:17,260
We,

290
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,130
we kicked things off.

291
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,993
Randall were good.

292
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,370
Just we had to cover the interview anyway.

293
00:08:21,371 --> 00:08:24,100
We had to go over all the crazy
shit that he's been going through.

294
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:27,760
The artist formerly known as Kim Jong Un.

295
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:33,340
Did you at any point in time
feel like you fucked up now man,

296
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,233
you know,

297
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:36,143
no,

298
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:37,211
this is the thing.

299
00:08:37,211 --> 00:08:40,830
I wasn't like scared for my
life or anything like that.

300
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,093
This is the thing.

301
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:42,800
There were enough

302
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,820
people like you,

303
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:44,841
friends,

304
00:08:44,841 --> 00:08:45,674
family,

305
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:50,060
people who were genuinely scared for
my life that it got me thinking like,

306
00:08:50,061 --> 00:08:51,830
should I be scared for my life?

307
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,260
Well you had secret service.

308
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,190
We had guards at the house.

309
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,210
Yeah.

310
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:57,631
Yeah.

311
00:08:57,631 --> 00:08:58,880
Sony provided US guards.

312
00:08:58,881 --> 00:08:59,714
If her mom,

313
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,440
it's like a couple of weeks,

314
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,430
what's the fuck Sony.

315
00:09:02,431 --> 00:09:04,650
And at first at first I was like,

316
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:07,030
we don't need guards series,

317
00:09:07,031 --> 00:09:07,920
so we don't need guards.

318
00:09:07,921 --> 00:09:08,754
They're like,

319
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:11,640
let us just give you some
guards just for peace of mind.

320
00:09:11,641 --> 00:09:12,091
I was like,

321
00:09:12,091 --> 00:09:12,710
all right,

322
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:13,543
all right.

323
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,620
And then a one and then one
day they were just gone.

324
00:09:16,621 --> 00:09:17,910
Like a few weeks later they're gone.

325
00:09:17,911 --> 00:09:18,570
And I was thinking,

326
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:18,991
oh my God,

327
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:19,621
we're the guards.

328
00:09:19,621 --> 00:09:20,580
I need pick guards.

329
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:20,971
You know,

330
00:09:20,971 --> 00:09:22,170
like I was just so,

331
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:24,030
you know,

332
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,890
I felt so protected by them when I did.

333
00:09:25,891 --> 00:09:27,210
It wouldn't have otherwise,

334
00:09:27,211 --> 00:09:27,840
you know,

335
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,110
I just got used to and then my
friends being so concerned for me,

336
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,240
it just Kinda got me paranoid.

337
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:33,560
Yeah.

338
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,990
Did anyone contact you?

339
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,710
Did you get any threats or anybody?

340
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,240
No.

341
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,021
No one on Twitter,

342
00:09:38,021 --> 00:09:39,580
like pretended to be from North Korea.

343
00:09:39,581 --> 00:09:40,414
And fucked with you.

344
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:41,920
We should have done a tool.

345
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:43,570
I,

346
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:44,360
you know,

347
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,970
would get like spam mail,

348
00:09:45,971 --> 00:09:49,660
like I always get and I would
think twice if I fee like,

349
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,583
wait a minute,

350
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:54,870
is this like regular spam
or is this like hacking?

351
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,170
So my email destroy my life spam,

352
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,013
you know?

353
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:58,983
And uh,

354
00:09:59,380 --> 00:09:59,741
but I,

355
00:09:59,741 --> 00:10:00,011
you know,

356
00:10:00,011 --> 00:10:00,810
I didn't know.

357
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:01,690
I would never have,

358
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:02,950
I just kind of deleted it.

359
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:03,830
Like I always do it.

360
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,701
Yeah.

361
00:10:04,701 --> 00:10:06,830
You're always yearning
that I was paranoid.

362
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:07,980
Yeah.

363
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:08,251
Yeah.

364
00:10:08,251 --> 00:10:08,851
Most likely.

365
00:10:08,851 --> 00:10:09,101
But I,

366
00:10:09,101 --> 00:10:09,321
I,

367
00:10:09,321 --> 00:10:09,541
you know,

368
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:10,530
I got paranoid.

369
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,970
I got paranoid after awhile and then the
movie came out and like we were talking

370
00:10:14,971 --> 00:10:15,511
about earlier,

371
00:10:15,511 --> 00:10:17,850
it just all died out.

372
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:20,190
The dust settled really quickly.

373
00:10:20,191 --> 00:10:21,090
It was like crazy.

374
00:10:21,091 --> 00:10:23,730
It was like the biggest news
and then all of a sudden,

375
00:10:23,731 --> 00:10:24,564
I don't know,

376
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,300
it seems like things just die quick
today because there's so much new scandal

377
00:10:29,301 --> 00:10:30,380
coming down every day.

378
00:10:30,381 --> 00:10:30,990
There's,

379
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,360
there's always something new,

380
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:34,040
nutty Dick pics,

381
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,120
sex scandals,

382
00:10:36,121 --> 00:10:37,790
something horrible happens,

383
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:38,720
you know,

384
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,730
isis cut somebody's head off something,

385
00:10:40,731 --> 00:10:40,941
you know,

386
00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:43,000
there's always some kind
of getting another one.

387
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,090
Yeah.

388
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:44,900
One year.

389
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,630
Things that used to happen in
five years happened in one year.

390
00:10:47,631 --> 00:10:49,070
Now it happened in a day.

391
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:49,970
It's weird.

392
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:50,130
Yeah.

393
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,020
It's kind of insane.

394
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:51,470
Yeah.

395
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,970
Things are accelerating for sure.

396
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,230
Even when I travel,

397
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:55,550
every city I go to,

398
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,100
there's a pocket of every
city that looks the same.

399
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,570
Like that same arts district is in
every fucking city with the same stores,

400
00:11:02,571 --> 00:11:03,440
the same kids,

401
00:11:03,441 --> 00:11:04,280
the same clothes,

402
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,210
and by contrast,

403
00:11:05,211 --> 00:11:06,350
the same apple bees,

404
00:11:06,351 --> 00:11:07,910
the same Walmart,

405
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,250
the same target them.

406
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,850
If you're in a target anywhere in America,

407
00:11:10,851 --> 00:11:12,600
you feel like you're in the same file.

408
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,573
Yeah.

409
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:14,180
Yeah.

410
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:17,150
How the fuck did you go from
being a chef to being on a sitcom?

411
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,290
What the hell is going on,

412
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:19,124
man?

413
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,660
How did you run this man?

414
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:21,441
Dude,

415
00:11:21,441 --> 00:11:21,710
I,

416
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:21,951
we,

417
00:11:21,951 --> 00:11:26,270
I guess we kind of ran the table and
fucking definitely we were for the cycle.

418
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,370
You were a ted talk.

419
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:29,080
I mean,

420
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,570
fuck yeah.

421
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:33,350
That's when I met you deal for this
show was cut the day I met you.

422
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,160
That's hilarious.

423
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:34,491
Yeah.

424
00:11:34,491 --> 00:11:35,750
You were part of this Joe.

425
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,650
That's a part of this.

426
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,730
I feel responsible.

427
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,050
You're part of Asian history.

428
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:39,880
You are.

429
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,190
Yeah.

430
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:40,701
Thank you.

431
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:41,330
Thank you Joe.

432
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,560
So how did it go down?

433
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,160
Well,

434
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,820
what happened was I was at Ted and then
there was this producer in Melvin Maher

435
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,880
who my boy Jay gave the book to.

436
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:53,650
So he read the book and
he was like looking these,

437
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:53,980
you

438
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,161
know,

439
00:11:54,161 --> 00:11:55,660
stats and demographics,

440
00:11:55,661 --> 00:11:59,350
they send those things in the studio
like pay attention to the Asian market.

441
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:00,430
They got fucking money now.

442
00:12:00,431 --> 00:12:01,264
You know what I mean?

443
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:03,610
People were buying fucking soy products.

444
00:12:03,611 --> 00:12:08,500
So he got one of those things that was
a directive or or some study saying,

445
00:12:08,501 --> 00:12:10,210
look there's a lot of Asian viewers,

446
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:10,961
you know,

447
00:12:10,961 --> 00:12:12,490
we should make some content for this.

448
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,960
The book landed on his table within
like the similar amount of time I was in

449
00:12:16,961 --> 00:12:17,620
Long Beach.

450
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,630
I was doing the show at you
and he met me that night.

451
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,710
Wow,

452
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:21,670
that's incredible.

453
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,230
That's incredible.

454
00:12:23,231 --> 00:12:24,580
And you got in trouble for doing the show,

455
00:12:24,581 --> 00:12:24,821
right?

456
00:12:24,821 --> 00:12:27,340
Cause you left Ted and they
get pissed at you for yeah,

457
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,990
they were mad because I did,

458
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,890
you know,

459
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,570
did the number one podcast in the world,

460
00:12:31,571 --> 00:12:34,540
Joe Rogan and then I also did DVD asa.

461
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:38,290
They weren't too happy about that and I
went to take the meeting with Melvin and

462
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:38,771
they were like,

463
00:12:38,771 --> 00:12:43,771
you should be here politicking with
these ted people suck in this Scientology

464
00:12:44,081 --> 00:12:49,081
Dick [inaudible] they have like no,

465
00:12:49,211 --> 00:12:49,511
no,

466
00:12:49,511 --> 00:12:50,830
no Scientology deals.

467
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:54,730
Was it that that they have like in a
like a specific thing plan for you or are

468
00:12:54,731 --> 00:12:55,840
they just wanted you to hang out?

469
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:56,050
No,

470
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,140
I had already given my talk
and then it was like dude we,

471
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,910
we'd looked like slow children.

472
00:13:00,911 --> 00:13:05,140
They had us with signs and like neck
lanyards with your photo and like speaker

473
00:13:05,141 --> 00:13:08,770
and then these people would be like donor
and we were supposed to like show more

474
00:13:08,771 --> 00:13:11,350
love to the donors and oh one of those.

475
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:13,560
Yeah.

476
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:14,920
I was like this is weird.

477
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:17,470
It was the beginning of my understanding,

478
00:13:17,471 --> 00:13:17,611
my,

479
00:13:17,611 --> 00:13:17,890
my,

480
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:20,650
my journey of trying to
understand what we're,

481
00:13:20,651 --> 00:13:25,210
ted has gone like where it's still what
it started out as and what it is now and

482
00:13:25,211 --> 00:13:27,190
you re re very illuminating.

483
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:27,710
Yeah,

484
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:30,700
it was cool cause after me and
Sarah Silverman kind of shit on it,

485
00:13:30,701 --> 00:13:32,500
there's been lots of people
that come out being like,

486
00:13:32,501 --> 00:13:33,790
Yo they fucked with my speech.

487
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:34,840
They told me to say this,

488
00:13:34,841 --> 00:13:35,870
they took this down.

489
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:40,210
And did you find that during your speech
where they like oh in your hands in it

490
00:13:40,211 --> 00:13:41,050
or yeah,

491
00:13:41,051 --> 00:13:42,760
they definitely tried to edit it.

492
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,930
I mean it's everywhere.

493
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:48,850
The last few years I've started to realize
everywhere you go besides like pretty

494
00:13:48,851 --> 00:13:50,800
much vice I guess is they,

495
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:51,580
they just,

496
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,021
they parked,

497
00:13:52,021 --> 00:13:53,210
they tried to put the Dick in it.

498
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,120
Here you go ma'am.

499
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:56,000
Come here,

500
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,850
come here.

501
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,600
You want to get rich too.

502
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:04,150
There's only one way that donor day,

503
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,300
well they would make you
stay with somebody else too.

504
00:14:07,301 --> 00:14:08,740
They made you stay in a room.

505
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:09,011
Yeah,

506
00:14:09,011 --> 00:14:09,521
it was weird.

507
00:14:09,521 --> 00:14:12,520
We were like adults and they had us
rooming and I was rooming with this other

508
00:14:12,521 --> 00:14:15,160
guy who was super nervous about
his speech and I was just like,

509
00:14:15,161 --> 00:14:15,994
this is bugged,

510
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:17,743
bugged out.

511
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:22,570
You gave me a box of kind bars and I'm
supposed to be cool with this and then

512
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:24,370
they get mad when you
go off to do other shit.

513
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,361
It's just a very,

514
00:14:25,361 --> 00:14:26,260
very bizarre,

515
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,340
bizarre,

516
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:27,581
yeah.

517
00:14:27,581 --> 00:14:29,380
You should sign up to be
a ted speaker one year,

518
00:14:29,381 --> 00:14:30,810
just so you could like do the expo,

519
00:14:30,811 --> 00:14:32,020
say not interested

520
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,520
too much as it is highly overexposed.

521
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,080
So fresh off the boat.

522
00:14:38,081 --> 00:14:38,741
When does it start,

523
00:14:38,741 --> 00:14:39,250
Erin?

524
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,390
February 4th.

525
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,860
It's a CBS,

526
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:42,581
ABC,

527
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:43,061
ABC.

528
00:14:43,061 --> 00:14:43,894
Beautiful.

529
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,950
February 4th.

530
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,600
And is everything in the can already?

531
00:14:46,601 --> 00:14:47,021
You guys done?

532
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:47,920
Are you filming right now?

533
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:48,221
Yeah,

534
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:48,850
we're done.

535
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:49,810
We're done shooting.

536
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,900
How many soldiers do?

537
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:51,741
13.

538
00:14:51,741 --> 00:14:52,370
13.

539
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:55,120
So they decided to film
13 and then air these,

540
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,000
they did a pilot.

541
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,660
They liked it and then they
just shot 13 or 12 more.

542
00:14:59,661 --> 00:14:59,930
Yeah.

543
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:00,740
That's nice.

544
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,573
That was nice.

545
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:02,060
Um,

546
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:05,600
if they pick up what they call the back
nine and to give you a full order of 22.

547
00:15:05,601 --> 00:15:06,171
When do you,

548
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:06,411
uh,

549
00:15:06,411 --> 00:15:07,520
when do you know about all that?

550
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,680
I think may and we find out in May.

551
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,280
Yeah.

552
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,600
I don't know if we're going into the bay.

553
00:15:11,601 --> 00:15:13,340
I think it'll be just a sec.

554
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:13,710
Yeah,

555
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:13,970
yeah,

556
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:14,803
yeah.

557
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:15,441
That's cool.

558
00:15:15,441 --> 00:15:16,970
So what's that experience been like?

559
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:18,311
Men,

560
00:15:18,311 --> 00:15:18,671
Randall,

561
00:15:18,671 --> 00:15:19,270
you go first.

562
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,081
I've been talking about it too.

563
00:15:20,081 --> 00:15:20,914
It's Randall.

564
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,490
Well,

565
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:24,850
I mean also the eldest Asian goes first.

566
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,930
I that's right.

567
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:26,853
Respect.

568
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,110
Uh,

569
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:29,800
you know,

570
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,611
for me it was,

571
00:15:30,611 --> 00:15:31,391
it was fun.

572
00:15:31,391 --> 00:15:31,701
It was a,

573
00:15:31,701 --> 00:15:32,111
you know,

574
00:15:32,111 --> 00:15:33,970
there was a lot of challenges.

575
00:15:33,971 --> 00:15:34,151
I,

576
00:15:34,151 --> 00:15:35,050
I was,

577
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,183
you know,

578
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:37,360
I've been kind of

579
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,820
the middle man,

580
00:15:39,821 --> 00:15:41,920
I feel like in a lot of the situation.

581
00:15:41,921 --> 00:15:43,860
So I like talking to the producers,

582
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,310
talking to the other actors,

583
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:46,510
talking to Eddie and like,

584
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:46,961
you know,

585
00:15:46,961 --> 00:15:49,550
trying to kind of navigate everything and,

586
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:49,810
and,

587
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:52,210
and hearing out their
issues and their problems.

588
00:15:52,211 --> 00:15:53,800
And so I don't know that,

589
00:15:53,801 --> 00:15:54,634
that,

590
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,290
I think with any TV show,

591
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:59,330
they're always like
politics and issues and,

592
00:15:59,340 --> 00:15:59,950
and,

593
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:04,950
but when you have one that's specifically
based on a memoir of a real life

594
00:16:05,711 --> 00:16:06,250
person,

595
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,083
you know,

596
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:07,751
there,

597
00:16:07,751 --> 00:16:11,140
there's a lot of kind of bumps in the
road and a lot of things to work out.

598
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,000
And we definitely had those,

599
00:16:13,001 --> 00:16:13,720
uh,

600
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,501
those issues.

601
00:16:14,501 --> 00:16:16,450
But with that being said,

602
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:17,651
I mean,

603
00:16:17,651 --> 00:16:18,371
I had a great time.

604
00:16:18,371 --> 00:16:19,540
The cast has been great.

605
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:20,320
The,

606
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:20,651
you know,

607
00:16:20,651 --> 00:16:21,150
the crew.

608
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,270
I had fun,

609
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:24,310
I had fun and uh,

610
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,660
I think it's like a,

611
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,710
it's a good show,

612
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,051
you know,

613
00:16:27,051 --> 00:16:27,220
it's,

614
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:31,570
and it's a groundbreaking show
like in terms of just Asians on TV.

615
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:36,640
Well Margaret shows the first she had
that show on you can girls 20 years ago.

616
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,360
Yeah,

617
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,530
I was around back then.

618
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,340
I remember it.

619
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,200
I was friends with Margaret and the whole,

620
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,160
when it went down it was,

621
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,211
it was weird.

622
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:44,530
It was telling me you got to lose weight,

623
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,510
you got to do this just different.

624
00:16:46,511 --> 00:16:50,500
You can have a fat Asian on TV or they
mean like her stories about her pretty

625
00:16:50,501 --> 00:16:51,191
fucking crazy.

626
00:16:51,191 --> 00:16:51,790
He's bad.

627
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:54,940
They had like an Asian consultant
or something on that show.

628
00:16:54,941 --> 00:16:57,970
Like basically telling
them how to be Asian,

629
00:16:57,971 --> 00:16:58,300
you know?

630
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:58,900
Yeah.

631
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,810
I mean we had those weird ass
accent coach too is too though.

632
00:17:01,811 --> 00:17:03,100
It was super cool.

633
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:04,240
Super Cool Dude.

634
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:06,280
But there was a dude that
was literally like Randall,

635
00:17:06,281 --> 00:17:06,781
your accent,

636
00:17:06,781 --> 00:17:08,380
like checking on the accents and shit.

637
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:08,911
Yeah.

638
00:17:08,911 --> 00:17:09,660
And hit that too.

639
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,441
That I,

640
00:17:10,441 --> 00:17:10,650
yeah,

641
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:11,470
super cool guy,

642
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,330
friend of mine even.

643
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,830
But it was like it,

644
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,490
it definitely got me in
my head for that pilot.

645
00:17:17,491 --> 00:17:19,470
So after once we got into the series,

646
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:19,981
I was like,

647
00:17:19,981 --> 00:17:20,191
no,

648
00:17:20,191 --> 00:17:21,360
I'm going to learn this.

649
00:17:21,361 --> 00:17:22,194
I'm going to learn this.

650
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,030
What were the accent?

651
00:17:24,031 --> 00:17:25,440
We try to learn Chinese accent.

652
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:25,720
It was

653
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,230
like a supposed to be a
mandarin Taiwanese accent.

654
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:31,330
But what I feel like there isn't one,

655
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,860
there isn't anyone locally
in their own fucked up.

656
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:34,990
That's what I learned.

657
00:17:34,991 --> 00:17:35,830
That's what I learned.

658
00:17:35,831 --> 00:17:36,580
It's like there is,

659
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:40,390
cause I went to so many
people to get like coaching,

660
00:17:40,391 --> 00:17:40,691
you know,

661
00:17:40,691 --> 00:17:45,691
like to get specifically
experts are actors who could
really do it because there

662
00:17:45,971 --> 00:17:47,560
were no dialect coaches who could do it.

663
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,100
But they all had different approaches

664
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:50,933
and I was like,

665
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,060
there is not one way to do an accent.

666
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:54,270
Yeah.

667
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:58,110
It's basically a cottage industry for
Asian people to just g off and be like,

668
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:58,411
oh no,

669
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:58,591
no,

670
00:17:58,591 --> 00:17:59,740
I know this thing.

671
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:00,741
Let me tell you.

672
00:18:00,741 --> 00:18:01,260
Yeah,

673
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,250
it's flied lice.

674
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:05,780
[inaudible] House.

675
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:06,623
And I know,

676
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,200
no,

677
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,040
it's not always.

678
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,780
So they're just running the
game and the white people like,

679
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:10,470
Oh gee,

680
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:10,711
okay,

681
00:18:10,711 --> 00:18:10,981
okay.

682
00:18:10,981 --> 00:18:11,770
He's religious.

683
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:12,603
He understands.

684
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,350
Yeah,

685
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:15,480
we have an Asian accent consultant.

686
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:16,830
They hired this guy,

687
00:18:16,831 --> 00:18:19,120
he's like an actress or actor and they,

688
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:19,560
he was like,

689
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,650
I got hired to consult on the
accent because I'm Taiwanese.

690
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,513
And it was like,

691
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:23,791
Yo,

692
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,140
this is so book.

693
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,390
What are they trying to do with you?

694
00:18:27,391 --> 00:18:29,500
They try to fuck with your
accent because you have a no,

695
00:18:29,501 --> 00:18:29,791
no,

696
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:30,390
no.

697
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,560
I just do voiceover,

698
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,050
do voiceover and give people a hard time.

699
00:18:34,051 --> 00:18:35,520
That's pretty much my job on the show.

700
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:36,930
So you don't act on the show?

701
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:37,591
No,

702
00:18:37,591 --> 00:18:38,041
I'm just,

703
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:38,874
I'm the voice.

704
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,833
Oh,

705
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,940
so someone play you?

706
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:42,361
Yeah,

707
00:18:42,361 --> 00:18:44,430
there's a 12 year old kid
who was a really cool kid.

708
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:45,841
Wow.

709
00:18:45,841 --> 00:18:47,520
So it's Sorta like that Chris rock show.

710
00:18:47,521 --> 00:18:48,450
Everybody hates Chris.

711
00:18:48,451 --> 00:18:48,870
Yeah,

712
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:49,570
exactly.

713
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:50,670
Yeah.

714
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,290
That's interesting.

715
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,230
Oh see I was under the
impression that you were acting.

716
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,343
I was confused.

717
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:56,910
But like voice.

718
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:57,301
Voice.

719
00:18:57,301 --> 00:18:57,900
Right.

720
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,740
And who do you play?

721
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,633
I play the Dat.

722
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:00,690
You play his dad.

723
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:01,770
That's a weird relationship.

724
00:19:01,771 --> 00:19:02,604
It's weird.

725
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,500
It's funny cause my mom on the
show is the same age as me now.

726
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:08,161
Oh.

727
00:19:08,161 --> 00:19:09,630
But super cool rent like,

728
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,051
you know,

729
00:19:10,051 --> 00:19:11,580
the actors on the show were incredible.

730
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:14,820
Like the casting on the show I
think is my favorite part of it.

731
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:15,180
Yeah.

732
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,800
I'm not just saying it
because home is here.

733
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,420
Like we really get along.

734
00:19:18,421 --> 00:19:19,021
We hang out,

735
00:19:19,021 --> 00:19:20,430
we eat Jamaican beef patties.

736
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,460
That's what we did worry that that 12
year old kid is going to be like that two

737
00:19:23,461 --> 00:19:25,500
and a half men kid just fucking get crazy.

738
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:25,991
Yes,

739
00:19:25,991 --> 00:19:26,460
yes,

740
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,000
yes,

741
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,833
absolutely.

742
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,190
He already gets crazy.

743
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,180
But I love the kid.

744
00:19:30,181 --> 00:19:31,170
He's a great kid.

745
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:32,280
He's like amazing.

746
00:19:32,281 --> 00:19:33,450
But he's a real kid.

747
00:19:33,451 --> 00:19:34,470
He's not like a,

748
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:35,550
an actor.

749
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:35,911
He,

750
00:19:35,911 --> 00:19:36,270
you know,

751
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:40,920
he didn't have hardly any experience
going in and that's part of the reason why

752
00:19:40,921 --> 00:19:41,701
we loved him so much.

753
00:19:41,701 --> 00:19:42,600
He was just raw,

754
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:43,081
you know,

755
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:43,501
Brooklyn,

756
00:19:43,501 --> 00:19:48,501
Chinese kid that went to a cold acting
at casting and then we saw his tape and I

757
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:49,920
remember watching,

758
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,270
did you get to see his audition?

759
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:51,910
Uh,

760
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:52,260
I saw,

761
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:52,471
I mean,

762
00:19:52,471 --> 00:19:53,850
I was there for some of the early ones,

763
00:19:53,851 --> 00:19:55,110
but I didn't see the original,

764
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,790
his audition is so funny.

765
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:59,940
They're like telling him to say things
and he's swinging at the camera with his

766
00:19:59,941 --> 00:20:00,600
arm.

767
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,240
He's looking in the wrong direction
and he just doesn't give a fuck.

768
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:06,000
And I saw the tables like
we have to cast this kid.

769
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,800
Just personality and just personality.

770
00:20:07,801 --> 00:20:10,710
He couldn't be bothered
and not be bothered.

771
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,790
And even when we sh,

772
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:15,990
I mean Randall may hate us at times just
because the kid will be bouncing off

773
00:20:15,991 --> 00:20:16,824
the walls.

774
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:20,040
Like we basically just captured
this real kid on camera.

775
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:20,820
Cool.

776
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,171
Start,

777
00:20:21,171 --> 00:20:21,960
stop.

778
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,793
Yeah.

779
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:23,970
But the other kids,

780
00:20:23,971 --> 00:20:26,430
like they were all polished actors,

781
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,293
you know,

782
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,920
with clean line reads,

783
00:20:28,921 --> 00:20:29,341
you know,

784
00:20:29,341 --> 00:20:29,761
like,

785
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:30,041
and,

786
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,070
and emoting right at the right,

787
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:32,760
you know,

788
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,050
right at the right word.

789
00:20:34,051 --> 00:20:34,860
And it just,

790
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,030
it just didn't feel like,

791
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:36,480
yeah.

792
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:36,781
When,

793
00:20:36,781 --> 00:20:37,140
when,

794
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,020
when a show comes around
that's very specifically Asian,

795
00:20:40,021 --> 00:20:41,670
it's hiring all these Asian people.

796
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:42,450
There's like,

797
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,300
there's a tremendous amount of
attention from the Asian community.

798
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,470
Everybody gets very excited.

799
00:20:46,471 --> 00:20:46,880
Like,

800
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,430
I have Asian friends that were actors

801
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:52,300
and they will get very bummed out that
there's no roles for Asian and they'd get

802
00:20:52,301 --> 00:20:56,140
really pissed off and I would bring up
like when John Wayne Played Kingus Khan

803
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:01,310
boiling read Mickey,

804
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,880
the Charlie Chan,

805
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,220
Charlie Chan was a white car,

806
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,920
had the tape on the ice.

807
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:08,500
Yeah.

808
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,130
So now that there's like
an actual agent show,

809
00:21:12,131 --> 00:21:16,210
like what has the response
been like you're an actor
who was like the wire dude.

810
00:21:16,211 --> 00:21:18,280
Basically every Asian
person is hitting you up.

811
00:21:18,281 --> 00:21:19,360
Like you'll kind of be bubbles.

812
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:22,840
Everybody wants to be bubbling.

813
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:23,290
Yeah,

814
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:24,123
exactly.

815
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,960
It's been like,

816
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:26,531
you know,

817
00:21:26,531 --> 00:21:30,730
I mean the overwhelming like just
positivity and negativity and,

818
00:21:30,731 --> 00:21:31,330
and you know,

819
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:33,460
skepticism and it's everything.

820
00:21:33,461 --> 00:21:35,500
It's because it's the only one you,

821
00:21:35,501 --> 00:21:36,334
and is there any

822
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,660
inter Asian like anger,

823
00:21:39,661 --> 00:21:43,320
like you are being a Korean guy
playing a guy who's from Taiwan?

824
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:43,701
You know,

825
00:21:43,701 --> 00:21:45,290
I haven't experienced it personally.

826
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:46,310
I'm sure it's out there.

827
00:21:46,311 --> 00:21:47,930
I haven't experienced it personally.

828
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,550
I had my own issues with that too.

829
00:21:49,551 --> 00:21:53,930
Like I actually went to Eddie like early
on after I found out the show is being

830
00:21:53,931 --> 00:21:55,130
picked up the pilot and I was like,

831
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,750
I don't think that this
doesn't feel right.

832
00:21:56,751 --> 00:21:58,640
I don't think I should
be playing this part.

833
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,950
Really handle super earnest about it.

834
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:01,431
Yeah,

835
00:22:01,431 --> 00:22:03,410
I like wigged out about it.

836
00:22:03,411 --> 00:22:07,080
I actually had a nervous breakdown
about it cause nervous breakdown and not

837
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,810
nervous about a panic attack.

838
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,280
I had a panic attack.

839
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:11,683
How does that go?

840
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:16,250
Just like I thought I was going to die
like literally like the night before I

841
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:16,420
was,

842
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,980
I couldn't sleep and
I have to keep moving.

843
00:22:18,981 --> 00:22:19,461
I was like,

844
00:22:19,461 --> 00:22:22,730
and I knew it was because of this cause
I was just so in my outs like I don't

845
00:22:22,731 --> 00:22:24,260
think I should be playing this part.

846
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,970
This is like a big moment.

847
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:26,930
Yeah.

848
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:30,440
And that's part of the reason that got
me to that thought was because after the

849
00:22:30,441 --> 00:22:33,500
show got picked up it was
already all over the Internet.

850
00:22:33,501 --> 00:22:34,730
Like amongst Asian people.

851
00:22:34,731 --> 00:22:36,890
Like super excited for it,

852
00:22:36,891 --> 00:22:37,724
you know?

853
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:38,190
Yeah.

854
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,450
The great yellow hopes shit.

855
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,313
It was just,

856
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,060
Oh my God,

857
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:43,650
our dicks are all going to get bigger.

858
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:47,310
February 4th my Dick is going
to be six and a half inches.

859
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:53,820
Everybody gonna have six and a half
inch sticks on February 4th so you,

860
00:22:54,061 --> 00:22:55,020
it's fascinating though.

861
00:22:55,021 --> 00:22:55,590
He was like,

862
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:56,423
Oh man,

863
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:57,630
I don't know if I should be,

864
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:58,830
I don't know if I'm the one,

865
00:22:58,890 --> 00:22:59,520
you know?

866
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,460
And it's just because of the fact that
you're Korean playing guy was Chinese.

867
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:03,600
Yeah.

868
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:03,811
Yeah.

869
00:23:03,811 --> 00:23:05,040
I mean that was a big part of it.

870
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:05,371
Also,

871
00:23:05,371 --> 00:23:06,204
I had my,

872
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:06,810
you know,

873
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:10,650
I had issues with the character and
we talked about it and I had like,

874
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:11,611
I was like,

875
00:23:11,611 --> 00:23:11,971
man,

876
00:23:11,971 --> 00:23:12,480
I don't know.

877
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,980
I just don't feel like this is

878
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:14,540
right.

879
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,530
I think that thing was,

880
00:23:15,531 --> 00:23:17,300
was Randall is so earnest and,

881
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,470
and the reason like I've really bonded
with Randall through the whole thing is

882
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,390
there's a lot of people that
lie to you in Hollywood.

883
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:25,070
There's a lot of fake
motherfuckers out here.

884
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,000
Wait a minute.

885
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,833
What are you saying?

886
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:27,963
Oh,

887
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:31,760
I can't be a part of the show
and I got a go have a meeting.

888
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:34,281
But no,

889
00:23:34,281 --> 00:23:35,180
like he would,

890
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:38,720
we would talk really openly
and honestly about the script,

891
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:42,520
like the things that didn't
seem to like represent my pop's,

892
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:42,810
that,

893
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:45,530
that weren't totally there
because you don't shows,

894
00:23:45,531 --> 00:23:48,800
they always have like a really powerful
woman and a kind of a schlubby dude.

895
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:53,900
My Dad walked around the crib in his
underwear with a k just chilling.

896
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:54,561
Did he really?

897
00:23:54,561 --> 00:23:54,990
Yeah.

898
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:55,430
Okay.

899
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:55,761
Yeah.

900
00:23:55,761 --> 00:23:59,750
He cocked it on my friend once when we
were just like watching cartoons in my

901
00:23:59,751 --> 00:24:00,260
dad was like,

902
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,160
ha ha.

903
00:24:01,161 --> 00:24:01,821
And I was like,

904
00:24:01,821 --> 00:24:02,654
Whoa,

905
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:05,631
bad ass.

906
00:24:05,631 --> 00:24:05,901
I mean,

907
00:24:05,901 --> 00:24:06,860
like I met him.

908
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,000
The dude is,

909
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:08,270
I mean,

910
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,021
not only bad it,

911
00:24:09,021 --> 00:24:10,130
he's just like a diner.

912
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:10,431
He's like,

913
00:24:10,431 --> 00:24:10,920
Eddie,

914
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,580
he's like this a dynamic person.

915
00:24:13,581 --> 00:24:13,800
You know,

916
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,670
he didn't mean a bed because my friend
had been asking him about it and he

917
00:24:16,671 --> 00:24:17,750
always wanted to see it.

918
00:24:17,751 --> 00:24:20,330
So my dad ones I just came
out with and it was like Bong,

919
00:24:20,331 --> 00:24:21,164
bong.

920
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:22,551
Yeah.

921
00:24:22,551 --> 00:24:22,911
So,

922
00:24:22,911 --> 00:24:23,301
so,

923
00:24:23,301 --> 00:24:24,134
you know,

924
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:25,790
we don't see much of that,

925
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,890
that in the character of the show.

926
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:28,720
But you know,

927
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,660
with that being said,

928
00:24:29,661 --> 00:24:29,871
like,

929
00:24:29,871 --> 00:24:31,160
you know my issues were just like,

930
00:24:31,161 --> 00:24:31,311
yeah,

931
00:24:31,311 --> 00:24:36,311
I don't want him to be like always like
the funny one are always the inept kind

932
00:24:37,551 --> 00:24:39,170
of classic Sitcom Dad.

933
00:24:39,171 --> 00:24:40,100
I want him to kind of,

934
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,510
I want him to do well.

935
00:24:41,511 --> 00:24:42,500
I want him to work hard.

936
00:24:42,501 --> 00:24:44,090
I want to be a good example for the kids.

937
00:24:44,091 --> 00:24:44,540
You know,

938
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,560
because again,

939
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,330
we're the only Asian show.

940
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:51,710
It's important that like I
don't just play that one lane.

941
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,960
I want him to be more fleshed out.

942
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:54,710
You know

943
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:55,650
that is a real issue.

944
00:24:55,651 --> 00:24:55,831
Right?

945
00:24:55,831 --> 00:24:58,320
If you're the only Asian
show on television,

946
00:24:58,321 --> 00:25:00,330
you definitely don't want
to be a negative stereotype.

947
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:04,650
You don't want to like play into all
the bullshit that is already out there.

948
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,150
The negative stereotypes.

949
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:06,993
Yeah.

950
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,220
That's a tricky,

951
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,240
tricky position.

952
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:09,420
Huh?

953
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:12,160
Is that why you felt like you
were real nervous about it though?

954
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,650
Pat was deaf that that was it.

955
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:13,900
See,

956
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,660
I mean also like in
combination with the accent,

957
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:17,523
you know,

958
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,090
if you have an accent,

959
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:19,600
that's one.

960
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:19,990
Thank you.

961
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,040
Hit me with some of that accident.

962
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,490
Come on down.

963
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:26,570
But,

964
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:27,403
but,

965
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,540
but the thing is just say fuck
you Joe Rogan with that accident.

966
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:32,483
Say that.

967
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:34,360
Just try it.

968
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:34,601
No,

969
00:25:34,601 --> 00:25:34,800
but,

970
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,360
but,

971
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,180
but fuck you.

972
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:39,953
Fuck you.

973
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,650
Joe Logan and Xingrei.

974
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,131
Yeah,

975
00:25:42,131 --> 00:25:42,810
exactly.

976
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:43,530
Uh,

977
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:43,811
no,

978
00:25:43,811 --> 00:25:44,201
but yeah,

979
00:25:44,201 --> 00:25:45,010
exactly.

980
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,970
You got an accent and we
just seen throughout history,

981
00:25:47,971 --> 00:25:48,900
Hollywood history,

982
00:25:48,901 --> 00:25:50,460
it's like as if there's an accent.

983
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,990
This character is one dimensional.

984
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:52,391
You know,

985
00:25:52,391 --> 00:25:54,250
David Show had this fucking great posts.

986
00:25:54,251 --> 00:25:54,911
It was one point in time.

987
00:25:54,911 --> 00:25:59,830
We pulled his DVD asa podcast off the
year and you put this great quote on his

988
00:25:59,831 --> 00:26:01,780
website about Jackie Chan.

989
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,261
He goes,

990
00:26:02,261 --> 00:26:05,470
how come Jackie Chan never
got to fuck or finger bang?

991
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:06,540
Yes,

992
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:06,811
yes,

993
00:26:06,811 --> 00:26:07,644
yes.

994
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,910
Totally killed off this whole thing about
everyone's afraid of the yellow man.

995
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:13,340
I want,

996
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,980
he talks about fear of a black planet.

997
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:16,000
We're on me on my style.

998
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:18,370
That was a huge moment
for like Asian kids.

999
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:19,060
Yeah.

1000
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:19,831
You remember chatting,

1001
00:26:19,831 --> 00:26:20,120
Leanna,

1002
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:20,590
Leah,

1003
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:22,160
if you could've just made out with the,

1004
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,560
I swear like that,

1005
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:24,320
would it just life,

1006
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,153
would it tripled

1007
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:27,820
in that theater?

1008
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:29,380
They don't even like,

1009
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:30,880
they don't even shake hands.

1010
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,593
What is that?

1011
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:37,030
And that's a Romeo and Juliet
that was like the fuck.

1012
00:26:37,031 --> 00:26:39,760
I don't even shake hands
except for walking dead.

1013
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,620
That's the only time with Asian guy wins.

1014
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,660
That's the thing is like there
had be a Zombie Apocalypse Asian

1015
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:46,831
too.

1016
00:26:46,831 --> 00:26:47,670
To get some pussy.

1017
00:26:47,671 --> 00:26:49,260
It has to be a Zombie apocalypse.

1018
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,820
That dude had to be a motherfucker,

1019
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,970
a few white dudes that want to
fuck that check you in that show.

1020
00:26:56,971 --> 00:26:59,070
But she's the hottest
chick on that show by far,

1021
00:26:59,071 --> 00:26:59,730
by far.

1022
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:00,221
By far.

1023
00:27:00,221 --> 00:27:00,631
By far.

1024
00:27:00,631 --> 00:27:02,580
And that's a big victory
for the guy was Asian here.

1025
00:27:02,581 --> 00:27:03,414
We caught one day.

1026
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:05,451
Yeah,

1027
00:27:05,451 --> 00:27:06,201
that was a good one.

1028
00:27:06,201 --> 00:27:06,380
Yeah.

1029
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,140
Well this is

1030
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,330
anger and resentment in
the Asian community too.

1031
00:27:09,331 --> 00:27:12,300
When Asian girls will
exclusively date white guys.

1032
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:13,261
Yeah.

1033
00:27:13,261 --> 00:27:14,130
I used to get mad,

1034
00:27:14,131 --> 00:27:15,240
but now I'm just like,

1035
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,133
it's cool.

1036
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,240
There's billions of us.

1037
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,260
That is a weird thing though,

1038
00:27:22,261 --> 00:27:22,620
right?

1039
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,320
I mean that's a common occurrence
when I was in college that way,

1040
00:27:25,321 --> 00:27:26,580
that that were like,

1041
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:26,911
yeah,

1042
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:29,280
that would definitely like get me upset,

1043
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:29,761
hit home.

1044
00:27:29,761 --> 00:27:30,750
But I'm the same.

1045
00:27:30,751 --> 00:27:30,961
Like,

1046
00:27:30,961 --> 00:27:31,591
I'm just like,

1047
00:27:31,591 --> 00:27:31,991
dude,

1048
00:27:31,991 --> 00:27:32,250
it's,

1049
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,083
you know,

1050
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:33,420
it's,

1051
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:37,410
my thing is everybody deals with their
identity and their own way and it's like

1052
00:27:37,411 --> 00:27:38,040
if you,

1053
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:38,610
if you,

1054
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:40,920
if you not loving someone
for the right reasons,

1055
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,630
it may rear its head in three months,

1056
00:27:42,631 --> 00:27:43,201
six months,

1057
00:27:43,201 --> 00:27:43,861
six years,

1058
00:27:43,861 --> 00:27:45,360
but eventually you're
going to deal with it.

1059
00:27:45,361 --> 00:27:46,020
Yeah.

1060
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:49,680
And it's just not my job to be judge
and jury Wickham machineries and white

1061
00:27:49,681 --> 00:27:50,161
dudes.

1062
00:27:50,161 --> 00:27:50,940
It's kind of,

1063
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:51,480
you know,

1064
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,690
shorty's that's,

1065
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,840
that's your prerogative,

1066
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,693
man.

1067
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,170
I used to get tightened college

1068
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,140
tighten college.

1069
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,110
I was always about white
chicks with big butts.

1070
00:28:04,111 --> 00:28:04,531
Anyway,

1071
00:28:04,531 --> 00:28:05,364
so

1072
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,480
who isn't UPA exactly.

1073
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:11,160
Paul Knox is a number one
dropdown on Bang Bros,

1074
00:28:11,161 --> 00:28:11,580
I think.

1075
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,030
Yeah,

1076
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:12,863
that's perfect

1077
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:13,780
ass white girl.

1078
00:28:13,781 --> 00:28:15,880
If you don't know what Pa WG means.

1079
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:18,340
Yeah.

1080
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,160
There's something about,

1081
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:19,301
well,

1082
00:28:19,301 --> 00:28:20,650
it's just such an anomaly.

1083
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:21,610
You know,

1084
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:23,020
you find a white girl with perfect cas.

1085
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,220
We were in a,

1086
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,800
Tony Hinchcliffe and I were in
this coffee shop the other day.

1087
00:28:26,801 --> 00:28:28,790
We met this black girl from Kenya who,

1088
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:29,681
she had an ash.

1089
00:28:29,681 --> 00:28:32,960
She turned around and we both went like
that and just looked at each other like,

1090
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,810
Jesus is that real?

1091
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,810
And then we talked about it
for like an hour afterwards.

1092
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,790
Like you don't ever see that
on any other nationality.

1093
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:42,190
It's only black chicks from Africa.

1094
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:45,760
I mean she had her ass was
like in the middle of her back,

1095
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,040
you know,

1096
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,550
west,

1097
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,930
west Indian or come up with,

1098
00:28:48,931 --> 00:28:50,070
it's like Caribbean,

1099
00:28:50,071 --> 00:28:50,910
west Indian,

1100
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,140
you'll get it right.

1101
00:28:52,141 --> 00:28:54,390
And right now there's a lot of
chicks with fake bloods out there.

1102
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,640
If you look at Instagram,

1103
00:28:56,641 --> 00:28:58,260
sometimes there's a lot
of these girls that,

1104
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:58,920
you know,

1105
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,390
they never showed the backside.

1106
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,260
Then all of a sudden,

1107
00:29:01,261 --> 00:29:02,250
like six weeks,

1108
00:29:02,251 --> 00:29:04,020
there's a gap in photos and then bang.

1109
00:29:04,021 --> 00:29:04,470
And you're like,

1110
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:05,220
Whoa,

1111
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:05,670
is that,

1112
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:06,810
you mean people here and,

1113
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,270
and the and yeah,

1114
00:29:08,271 --> 00:29:08,790
that's a thing.

1115
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:08,911
Yeah.

1116
00:29:08,911 --> 00:29:11,790
There's a few girls in New
York for Israel that's like,

1117
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:12,181
Yo,

1118
00:29:12,181 --> 00:29:13,770
it's huge in Brazil and Colombia.

1119
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,590
But in New York now there's a lot of
New York girls could be fake blood.

1120
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,150
You know what's fucked up about that?

1121
00:29:18,151 --> 00:29:23,151
It's like a girl can get her a but
big by working out and lift weights.

1122
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,910
But you can't do anything about your
breasts if you want your breasts to be

1123
00:29:26,911 --> 00:29:27,660
larger.

1124
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,430
I don't think they have
a solution to that yet.

1125
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,320
But if you want your asked to be big,

1126
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:31,951
all you gotta do it.

1127
00:29:31,951 --> 00:29:32,850
You Lazy Bitch,

1128
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,320
just do some squats.

1129
00:29:34,321 --> 00:29:36,050
You don't have to stick plastic in here.

1130
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,680
My ass is tight.

1131
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:38,820
I got to workout.

1132
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,500
Beautiful.

1133
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,040
I knew a dude

1134
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,030
who had chest implants.

1135
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:43,380
Oh,

1136
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,213
what?

1137
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:44,951
Yeah,

1138
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:45,401
he got who?

1139
00:29:45,401 --> 00:29:46,240
Just implants.

1140
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,040
That's weird.

1141
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,873
It was a comedian.

1142
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,030
He decided he would,

1143
00:29:49,031 --> 00:29:49,241
you know,

1144
00:29:49,241 --> 00:29:52,510
he wanted to be a sitcom star and that's
chicken chest and instead of working

1145
00:29:52,511 --> 00:29:52,661
out,

1146
00:29:52,661 --> 00:29:53,890
I mean I think you
worked out a little bit,

1147
00:29:53,891 --> 00:29:55,000
but he had peck implants.

1148
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:55,660
I feel like,

1149
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,710
I feel like fat Jew,

1150
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,551
I think I talked to him.

1151
00:29:57,551 --> 00:30:01,330
I think he wants breast and close
fat Jew that this comedian fed shoe.

1152
00:30:01,331 --> 00:30:02,150
He's awesome.

1153
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:02,831
That's his name.

1154
00:30:02,831 --> 00:30:03,190
Yeah,

1155
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,023
that's his name.

1156
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:04,421
Yeah.

1157
00:30:04,421 --> 00:30:06,060
He sends me photos like this to,

1158
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,330
he sends me wild photos
of Turkey testicles.

1159
00:30:10,331 --> 00:30:12,040
This is super weird stuff,

1160
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:12,371
man.

1161
00:30:12,371 --> 00:30:13,330
But he's the best.

1162
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,561
You have to see this.

1163
00:30:14,561 --> 00:30:16,300
He sent this to me for thanksgiving,

1164
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:17,810
but yeah.

1165
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,183
Hmm.

1166
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:23,110
So it's a Turkey with his balls.

1167
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:23,571
Yeah.

1168
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:24,500
You can out of the hole.

1169
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:25,590
It's a Turkey.

1170
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:29,640
He cut out putting balls
in the photo of his balls.

1171
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:30,750
Yeah.

1172
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:31,140
It's just,

1173
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,270
it was an acceptable way
for him to send his balls.

1174
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:35,170
Exactly.

1175
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,003
Yeah.

1176
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,670
Is he a guy in New York?

1177
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:38,150
Yeah.

1178
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:38,670
Yeah.

1179
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:38,860
He,

1180
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,581
he's in New York.

1181
00:30:39,581 --> 00:30:40,960
He's been a homemaker for a few years.

1182
00:30:40,961 --> 00:30:42,040
He was like in this rap group,

1183
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:42,950
team face lift.

1184
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:46,080
Super futuristic to you.

1185
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,230
You got to have him on the show.

1186
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:47,830
All right.

1187
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:49,480
If I'm in fat Jew.

1188
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,573
Interesting.

1189
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,341
That's my man.

1190
00:30:51,341 --> 00:30:52,110
Strange name.

1191
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:52,943
Yeah.

1192
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:54,460
Yeah.

1193
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:57,070
So you guys have been filming
this for how many months now?

1194
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:58,750
Ooh.

1195
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,790
Since uh,

1196
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,780
we ended right before Christmas.

1197
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,180
And did it go through like,

1198
00:31:05,181 --> 00:31:05,810
um,

1199
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:10,490
I've been on a sitcom news radio from the
beginning to like the one of the first

1200
00:31:10,491 --> 00:31:11,480
episodes to the end.

1201
00:31:11,481 --> 00:31:15,770
It's like they grow and everybody sort
of finds their own rhythm and people get

1202
00:31:15,771 --> 00:31:17,270
fired and writers,

1203
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:18,410
new writers come in.

1204
00:31:18,411 --> 00:31:19,580
Do you guys have go through all that?

1205
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:21,920
We didn't like that.

1206
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:25,250
Only because we didn't start
airing while we're in production.

1207
00:31:25,251 --> 00:31:26,720
I feel like those things
happen when you're,

1208
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:30,400
when it starts airing and
then the feedback comes and,

1209
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,790
and you know the,

1210
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:35,540
the lower it maybe if the ratings are
like on the edge and then they start

1211
00:31:35,541 --> 00:31:36,111
panicking,

1212
00:31:36,111 --> 00:31:37,610
oh we've got to make
changes but we didn't.

1213
00:31:37,611 --> 00:31:39,860
We like we're literally
in a bubble kind of thing.

1214
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:44,200
It's a gift and a curse that your mid
season when you're mid season they buy all

1215
00:31:44,201 --> 00:31:45,850
the episodes and they're going to all air.

1216
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:46,270
Yeah.

1217
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:48,130
So did they do a pilot first?

1218
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:48,761
Yeah,

1219
00:31:48,761 --> 00:31:49,630
the pilot's great.

1220
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:52,840
They did the pilot pilots actually my
favorite episode of the whole season.

1221
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:53,800
So he's did a pilot.

1222
00:31:53,801 --> 00:31:55,630
And then how long before
they decided to pick it up?

1223
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,593
Had

1224
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:00,370
a little bit of a break.

1225
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:00,611
Yeah,

1226
00:32:00,611 --> 00:32:01,450
we finished it.

1227
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,340
I feel like we delivered it in March.

1228
00:32:03,341 --> 00:32:03,671
Right.

1229
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:04,900
And then we found out in May.

1230
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:05,420
Yeah,

1231
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,650
beginning of man months.

1232
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:07,580
Yeah.

1233
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,413
Two months.

1234
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,710
I didn't think it was gonna get picked up.

1235
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:12,110
Not because I didn't
think it was good cause I,

1236
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,390
nothing gets picked up
but nothing gets picked.

1237
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:18,890
That number one and that no Asian
family sitcom gets picked up one ever.

1238
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,330
One 20 years ago.

1239
00:32:20,331 --> 00:32:20,601
Yeah,

1240
00:32:20,601 --> 00:32:21,020
it was fine.

1241
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,100
I knew it would get picked up.

1242
00:32:22,101 --> 00:32:22,940
I told everybody,

1243
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:23,331
I was like,

1244
00:32:23,331 --> 00:32:23,930
Yo man,

1245
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:24,960
see what chase bank,

1246
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,313
Chase Bank.

1247
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,031
Eddie knew.

1248
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:29,960
I was just like,

1249
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:30,621
you know,

1250
00:32:30,621 --> 00:32:33,340
I mean I've been in the trenches
as an actor for it for a long end.

1251
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,550
Like these things don't happen.

1252
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:36,091
They don't happen.

1253
00:32:36,091 --> 00:32:36,801
And then it happened.

1254
00:32:36,801 --> 00:32:37,520
I was like,

1255
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,840
well they occasionally happened.

1256
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,480
Yeah,

1257
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:39,930
yeah,

1258
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:40,480
yeah,

1259
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:40,910
yeah.

1260
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:41,571
I feel like you,

1261
00:32:41,571 --> 00:32:42,800
you will shit to happen.

1262
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,810
Like when my whole life I just feel like,

1263
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,500
you know,

1264
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:49,100
you gotta like will it and just believe
it and if you don't then it really

1265
00:32:49,101 --> 00:32:49,371
won't.

1266
00:32:49,371 --> 00:32:52,190
It has to you everything had
the Mojo all has to line up.

1267
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:53,443
It helps.

1268
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,270
It helps if you believe it does.

1269
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,640
There's a lot of people out there
that watched the secret and thought,

1270
00:32:58,641 --> 00:32:59,474
I'm going to change.

1271
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,570
Nothing fucking happen.

1272
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:02,331
No,

1273
00:33:02,331 --> 00:33:03,050
I think you have.

1274
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:05,990
It's essential to believe and
then there's still a lot of shit,

1275
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,350
but if you don't believe it,

1276
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,050
you good luck.

1277
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:09,831
Yeah.

1278
00:33:09,831 --> 00:33:10,200
It's,

1279
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,110
there's a vibration
that you have to catch.

1280
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:16,310
You have to be on a frequency and all
these things have to align together in

1281
00:33:16,311 --> 00:33:17,600
order for it to be successful.

1282
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,250
Yeah.

1283
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:18,490
And,

1284
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:19,490
and you can feel it.

1285
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,990
Like you can really feel the energy.

1286
00:33:20,991 --> 00:33:24,940
Like we had a good energy on our show
and I think it's because everyone,

1287
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:25,850
this was the biggest thing.

1288
00:33:25,851 --> 00:33:26,930
Anyone will not,

1289
00:33:26,931 --> 00:33:29,620
you had a lot of other hits
but like constants Hudson,

1290
00:33:29,621 --> 00:33:30,454
the kids,

1291
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:30,771
you know,

1292
00:33:30,771 --> 00:33:33,290
it's Melvin the producers
first thing that's his own.

1293
00:33:33,291 --> 00:33:35,510
It was the biggest thing
I've done and you know,

1294
00:33:35,511 --> 00:33:38,000
for everybody was just
like humbling to be there.

1295
00:33:38,001 --> 00:33:38,511
Happy,

1296
00:33:38,511 --> 00:33:39,590
happy to get there.

1297
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,120
And then once we got there we were like,

1298
00:33:41,121 --> 00:33:41,954
let's Breck shot,

1299
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:42,840
you know,

1300
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,760
let's do this.

1301
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,200
Well you should act man.

1302
00:33:45,201 --> 00:33:46,490
You got such a great personality

1303
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,220
that all the time I tell him,

1304
00:33:49,221 --> 00:33:50,054
I'm like,

1305
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:50,811
I'm like,

1306
00:33:50,811 --> 00:33:51,970
I'm writing something for you at.

1307
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:55,530
That's why it made sense to
me that you were on a sitcom.

1308
00:33:55,531 --> 00:33:56,790
Like there's a lot of chefs,

1309
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,590
if you told me they were
on a sitcom would be like,

1310
00:33:58,591 --> 00:33:59,090
what?

1311
00:33:59,090 --> 00:33:59,310
Yeah,

1312
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,143
like Emeril.

1313
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:05,420
I didn't know exactly.

1314
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:06,151
Exactly.

1315
00:34:06,151 --> 00:34:06,391
Yeah,

1316
00:34:06,391 --> 00:34:07,730
and Merle had a fucking said calm.

1317
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,970
I think it was called Emeril.

1318
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:09,871
Yeah.

1319
00:34:09,871 --> 00:34:12,090
It was like some fucking NBC disaster.

1320
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:12,720
Fuck.

1321
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,553
Oh my God.

1322
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,750
He's actually pretty
fucking cool in person.

1323
00:34:15,751 --> 00:34:17,040
Like I chill with Emeril on top.

1324
00:34:17,041 --> 00:34:18,330
Chef dude is,

1325
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:19,740
especially in New Orleans.

1326
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:21,180
I got to hang with them in New Orleans.

1327
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:21,991
Cool.

1328
00:34:21,991 --> 00:34:22,161
Dude.

1329
00:34:22,161 --> 00:34:22,994
That's a spot.

1330
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:23,190
Yeah,

1331
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:23,911
that's his spot.

1332
00:34:23,911 --> 00:34:24,300
But like,

1333
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:24,511
no,

1334
00:34:24,511 --> 00:34:25,020
I,

1335
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:25,621
I definitely,

1336
00:34:25,621 --> 00:34:26,371
I told my agent,

1337
00:34:26,371 --> 00:34:26,641
I was like,

1338
00:34:26,641 --> 00:34:26,851
Yo,

1339
00:34:26,851 --> 00:34:29,720
if there's any roles out there for
an Asian Joe Peshy fucking sign,

1340
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,280
that's what I want to be.

1341
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:33,330
An Asian Joe,

1342
00:34:33,331 --> 00:34:36,030
Joe Pegi Goodfellows or
Joe Pesci lethal weapon.

1343
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:36,151
Oh,

1344
00:34:36,151 --> 00:34:37,230
like my cousin Vinny.

1345
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:37,880
Ah,

1346
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,260
yeah,

1347
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,093
yeah,

1348
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,073
yeah,

1349
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:40,471
yeah.

1350
00:34:40,471 --> 00:34:40,711
I mean,

1351
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:41,930
you could totally do you.

1352
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,070
That's why when I heard
that you were doing it,

1353
00:34:44,071 --> 00:34:44,430
I was like,

1354
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:45,270
oh wow.

1355
00:34:45,271 --> 00:34:45,640
What did we,

1356
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:49,770
this fucking versatile motherfucker
could shine a voice acting,

1357
00:34:49,771 --> 00:34:50,071
but no,

1358
00:34:50,071 --> 00:34:50,420
I got it.

1359
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,350
I got to do the acting it,

1360
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,193
it'll be fun.

1361
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:52,960
I'm excited.

1362
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,100
The voice acting to that.

1363
00:34:54,101 --> 00:34:55,000
I mean that's like,

1364
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:56,610
I feel like that was a huge,

1365
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,180
I mean that wasn't in the original,

1366
00:34:58,181 --> 00:34:59,280
that wasn't in the original.

1367
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:02,710
Nafta kind of came in like
how can we make this better?

1368
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:07,330
And then they came up with the idea we
got to have Eddie and that like changed

1369
00:35:07,331 --> 00:35:07,541
it.

1370
00:35:07,541 --> 00:35:08,820
It like really made a,

1371
00:35:08,821 --> 00:35:10,000
solidified the show,

1372
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:10,863
you know,

1373
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,151
and,

1374
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:11,331
and,

1375
00:35:11,331 --> 00:35:13,240
and framed it in the right way.

1376
00:35:13,241 --> 00:35:14,200
It happened in the edit.

1377
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,580
I think it was just in the edit.

1378
00:35:15,581 --> 00:35:15,971
They were like,

1379
00:35:15,971 --> 00:35:16,480
Yo,

1380
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,430
you should fucking
Kevin Arnold this thing.

1381
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:18,970
Yeah.

1382
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:19,803
You know,

1383
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:20,980
I was so excited.

1384
00:35:20,981 --> 00:35:21,670
I was really,

1385
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:24,400
they told him I was playing ball
when Melvin called me and was like,

1386
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,270
Oh lucky I do this.

1387
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:26,160
I was playing football.

1388
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,250
Getting pockets.

1389
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:30,700
Yeah.

1390
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,140
Is there any way they could write you in?

1391
00:35:32,141 --> 00:35:32,351
I mean,

1392
00:35:32,351 --> 00:35:34,450
who would you play if you
were going to be on that show?

1393
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:35,261
You'll like cousin,

1394
00:35:35,261 --> 00:35:37,030
cousin Eddie would be sick or cousin.

1395
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,070
I got a cousin

1396
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:38,910
Allen or something.

1397
00:35:38,911 --> 00:35:39,490
But yeah,

1398
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:40,890
like cousin.

1399
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,101
Yeah,

1400
00:35:41,101 --> 00:35:42,280
you could be like kids cousin.

1401
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:45,940
It's always given them like
sneaky advice in trouble.

1402
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:46,290
You know,

1403
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:47,400
leading them astray.

1404
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:48,631
Temptation,

1405
00:35:48,631 --> 00:35:48,961
life,

1406
00:35:48,961 --> 00:35:49,261
man.

1407
00:35:49,261 --> 00:35:50,120
The kid was telling me,

1408
00:35:50,121 --> 00:35:50,371
it's like,

1409
00:35:50,371 --> 00:35:50,531
Yo,

1410
00:35:50,531 --> 00:35:51,870
like I like girls now,

1411
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,650
like word.

1412
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,430
That's great.

1413
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:54,241
That's great.

1414
00:35:54,241 --> 00:35:54,780
That's great.

1415
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:55,471
That's really great.

1416
00:35:55,471 --> 00:35:56,304
You like girls?

1417
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,360
And I was like,

1418
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,130
do you have like a girlfriend or whatever?

1419
00:35:59,131 --> 00:35:59,341
He's like,

1420
00:35:59,341 --> 00:35:59,521
no,

1421
00:35:59,521 --> 00:36:00,360
there's this girl I like,

1422
00:36:00,361 --> 00:36:01,590
but I'm afraid to talk to her.

1423
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,300
And I was like,

1424
00:36:03,301 --> 00:36:05,880
well what are you going to do
then you should go talk to her.

1425
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:06,481
And he's like,

1426
00:36:06,481 --> 00:36:06,631
no,

1427
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:06,721
no,

1428
00:36:06,721 --> 00:36:06,811
no,

1429
00:36:06,811 --> 00:36:07,740
I don't want to talk to her.

1430
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,491
And I was like,

1431
00:36:08,491 --> 00:36:09,181
well what do you want to do?

1432
00:36:09,181 --> 00:36:09,520
And he's like,

1433
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,490
I kind of want to touch her.

1434
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,373
I was like,

1435
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:12,683
good.

1436
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,351
So I'm like,

1437
00:36:13,351 --> 00:36:13,531
Yo,

1438
00:36:13,531 --> 00:36:14,820
when she gets out of class,

1439
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,280
just kind of bumped into
her boobs with your elbow.

1440
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:17,530
No,

1441
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:18,260
don't tell him he's like,

1442
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:18,521
what?

1443
00:36:18,521 --> 00:36:18,871
And I was like,

1444
00:36:18,871 --> 00:36:19,051
no.

1445
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:19,191
Yeah,

1446
00:36:19,191 --> 00:36:20,860
you got to just kind of
bumping into the booth.

1447
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,261
Can't tell him that.

1448
00:36:22,261 --> 00:36:24,420
And you definitely can't admit that
on the Internet because if he goes,

1449
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:27,540
if he goes and does that now
that's like sexual assault.

1450
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:29,400
It's not that you did
that in middle school.

1451
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,840
You come out of like seventh grade.

1452
00:36:30,841 --> 00:36:31,920
I lived in a different world.

1453
00:36:31,921 --> 00:36:32,371
My friend,

1454
00:36:32,371 --> 00:36:32,911
this is the world,

1455
00:36:32,911 --> 00:36:33,430
the Internet,

1456
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:34,560
social justice warriors.

1457
00:36:34,561 --> 00:36:35,360
He just asked that dude,

1458
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:35,640
come on.

1459
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,120
Rape.

1460
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:36,631
No,

1461
00:36:36,631 --> 00:36:37,091
no,

1462
00:36:37,091 --> 00:36:37,381
no.

1463
00:36:37,381 --> 00:36:38,214
In this world,

1464
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,410
your illegally touching a sexual
organ with your elbow on purpose.

1465
00:36:43,411 --> 00:36:44,191
It's not an accident.

1466
00:36:44,191 --> 00:36:45,270
You're pretending it's an accident.

1467
00:36:45,271 --> 00:36:45,901
Fuck man.

1468
00:36:45,901 --> 00:36:46,900
Do I have to apologize?

1469
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:47,470
Dark.

1470
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:48,480
We're so sorry.

1471
00:36:48,481 --> 00:36:49,920
Boobs with,

1472
00:36:49,921 --> 00:36:52,470
I'm so sorry to all those boobs out there.

1473
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,380
Especially if the girl doesn't
want him to touch her boobs,

1474
00:36:55,381 --> 00:36:56,670
then it's really sexual assault.

1475
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:57,961
Do you know?

1476
00:36:57,961 --> 00:36:59,700
I'm sure he's a good kid.

1477
00:36:59,701 --> 00:37:03,970
I'm sure she wouldn't mind it
if that's not sure enough rent.

1478
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:04,351
Randall,

1479
00:37:04,351 --> 00:37:07,170
you never like kind of just brushed up
against the pedal and are meant to it.

1480
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,860
Even if I cannot recall the only one.

1481
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:14,250
I'm the only one that was
running my Nautica competition.

1482
00:37:14,251 --> 00:37:14,740
Fleece.

1483
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,330
Gabriel,

1484
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:18,540
stop beating that Cosby horse
and start running towards you.

1485
00:37:18,541 --> 00:37:19,160
It sticks.

1486
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:19,880
No Man.

1487
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,500
No [inaudible] not on that.

1488
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:22,860
No.

1489
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:23,693
Come on.

1490
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:25,080
It doesn't matter.

1491
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,230
There's so many people out there,

1492
00:37:26,231 --> 00:37:27,300
they're looking to be angry.

1493
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:28,820
They're looking to find something.

1494
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:29,230
They just,

1495
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:32,700
they can't brush it off as something
innocent or joking around and especially

1496
00:37:32,701 --> 00:37:35,310
when it comes to something
like asking a young kid,

1497
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,510
giving him advice,

1498
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,210
had a bump in with chicks tits,

1499
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:38,760
maybe.

1500
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,840
Maybe I did fuck up.

1501
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:40,621
Do you fucked up?

1502
00:37:40,621 --> 00:37:41,490
Fuck it doesn't matter.

1503
00:37:41,491 --> 00:37:42,540
Which is what you tell them to do.

1504
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:46,830
Tell him to let her watch him on TV
and then she'll probably like him.

1505
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:48,040
Compelling.

1506
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:48,300
All right,

1507
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,040
I'm going to have to call
Hudson tonight and be like,

1508
00:37:50,041 --> 00:37:50,281
Yo,

1509
00:37:50,281 --> 00:37:54,150
remember that technique I told you about
kind of brushing or pick a new plan.

1510
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:55,163
New Plan.

1511
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,650
Uncle Joe wants her to
watch the show first.

1512
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:00,930
Trust uncle Joe,

1513
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:02,520
the pussy buses coming.

1514
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:02,851
All right.

1515
00:38:02,851 --> 00:38:04,140
They're loading it up right now.

1516
00:38:04,141 --> 00:38:05,280
Once you get on TV,

1517
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,800
they're gonna want to broad
brushed her tits up against you.

1518
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,590
Then it's wait for them
to brush up against you.

1519
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:12,840
That sexual assault,

1520
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:14,040
nobody complains about that.

1521
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:15,190
Sexual assault is not a guy.

1522
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,190
Lives there were complaining
about a girl brushing her tits up.

1523
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:21,270
I remember the first time I
saw up a skirt was incredible.

1524
00:38:21,271 --> 00:38:23,250
I wasn't earth space science class.

1525
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,590
I was an earth space science and I would,

1526
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,041
oh this,

1527
00:38:26,041 --> 00:38:29,820
there was this one Colombian
chick that was so fly,

1528
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,080
like always came done up,

1529
00:38:31,081 --> 00:38:33,060
was the first one to be
wearing heels in school.

1530
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:33,923
How old was she?

1531
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:34,501
Well,

1532
00:38:34,501 --> 00:38:38,740
we were both 14 so we were both
14 she might've went 15 heels.

1533
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:39,730
She's wearing heels.

1534
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:43,240
And I remember she had this like hounds
tooth dress on and I was just like,

1535
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:43,781
Yo,

1536
00:38:43,781 --> 00:38:46,600
her legs look like fucking Hams right now.

1537
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:46,841
Oh,

1538
00:38:46,841 --> 00:38:48,010
they look like Christmas.

1539
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,700
Honeybaked Hams in there.

1540
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:51,940
And I could not stop looking.

1541
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:53,850
And I remember she turned to me,

1542
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:57,040
smiled and just open her legs and nodded.

1543
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,600
And I was like looked.

1544
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:00,910
And it was just peach fuzz and bear.

1545
00:39:00,911 --> 00:39:02,590
And I was Oh,

1546
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:03,570
oh,

1547
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:04,121
lifelong.

1548
00:39:04,121 --> 00:39:05,200
She had no underwear on,

1549
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:06,190
no underwear.

1550
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:06,611
Oh my gosh.

1551
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:07,480
She's just flashed.

1552
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,430
I was 14 and I was a site and I was,

1553
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:10,181
I was like me.

1554
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:10,570
She was like,

1555
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:11,330
yeah.

1556
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:12,163
Wow.

1557
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:12,520
Oh,

1558
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,540
like this is for you.

1559
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:13,841
Yeah.

1560
00:39:13,841 --> 00:39:14,320
And I was,

1561
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,160
I was cooked.

1562
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,210
I couldn't talk to her.

1563
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:17,380
Yeah.

1564
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,430
That was my first time.

1565
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,560
That was my first time.

1566
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,400
But yeah,

1567
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:27,610
so maybe I should've just told Hudson
just keeps staring be at the right place

1568
00:39:27,611 --> 00:39:28,190
at the right.

1569
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:28,640
Yes,

1570
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:28,990
Darren,

1571
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:29,980
they call that I rape.

1572
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,340
Oh Yay.

1573
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,310
You're going to have to issue on it.

1574
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,150
And you've been reading the New Yorker?

1575
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:34,540
No,

1576
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:34,870
I just,

1577
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:35,560
I like to,

1578
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,950
I like to read super progressive
websites where they're just out of their

1579
00:39:38,951 --> 00:39:39,784
fucking mind.

1580
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:40,480
Yeah.

1581
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,810
Mostly people that no one wants to
fuck and with they're trying to do is

1582
00:39:43,811 --> 00:39:47,560
establish these parameters for what
is appropriate and not appropriate.

1583
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,170
It's mostly against,

1584
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:50,470
that's the thing though.

1585
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:54,910
That doesn't work because like I'm all
about women's rights and and ideologies

1586
00:39:54,911 --> 00:39:59,110
and all those things is I just went and
did a whole piece in Japan about why the

1587
00:39:59,111 --> 00:40:03,670
birth rate is declining there and I was
like championing the fact that we've

1588
00:40:03,671 --> 00:40:08,620
asked women to go into the workplace
but then not redistribute the duties of

1589
00:40:08,621 --> 00:40:12,520
home and childbearing and child
bearing and it's just like we have to

1590
00:40:12,521 --> 00:40:15,640
redistribute the duties
that are traditionally left
for women because they're

1591
00:40:15,641 --> 00:40:19,720
working now we all got to share but then
when you just have rules of like don't

1592
00:40:19,721 --> 00:40:20,980
do this and don't do that,

1593
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:24,040
you're not really understanding
the relationship of like men,

1594
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:25,000
women in society.

1595
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,630
You just setting weird ass rules then
make everybody upset and uncomfortable.

1596
00:40:28,631 --> 00:40:30,780
It's also like who's
setting those rules like?

1597
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,070
Like one of them is about drinking.

1598
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,930
Like they're saying that men and women
when they're having sex with this,

1599
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:40,270
it's hilarious blog that I like to read
occasionally and they were trying to say

1600
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,290
that if men and women,

1601
00:40:41,291 --> 00:40:42,040
if they're both,

1602
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:42,880
if they're drinking,

1603
00:40:42,881 --> 00:40:44,350
if you're drinking and
you have sex with someone,

1604
00:40:44,351 --> 00:40:45,160
it's rape.

1605
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:48,340
Including if a woman is
sober and the man is drunk,

1606
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:49,870
if the woman has sex with a drunk man,

1607
00:40:49,871 --> 00:40:50,704
she's raping him,

1608
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,250
which is raping her fucking hilarious.

1609
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:55,383
It is hilarious.

1610
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:56,740
Might be my favorite position.

1611
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,580
If you're drunk,

1612
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,930
you ain't me being drunk.

1613
00:40:58,931 --> 00:40:59,920
Her being sober.

1614
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,480
That is my favorite position.

1615
00:41:01,481 --> 00:41:04,150
The language that they use is that they,

1616
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:04,931
if you're drunk,

1617
00:41:04,931 --> 00:41:07,150
they put you in a position
where you cannot consent.

1618
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:09,250
You're not able to consent
because you're drunk.

1619
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:12,910
I mean,

1620
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:13,780
which is,

1621
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:14,501
it's first of all,

1622
00:41:14,501 --> 00:41:18,100
it's rude towards women because
some women have to be drunk.

1623
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:18,240
They,

1624
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:18,510
they,

1625
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:19,211
it's a strategy.

1626
00:41:19,211 --> 00:41:19,930
They did it on purpose.

1627
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:22,480
They want to be drunk so that they could
deal with the fact they're gonna let

1628
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:23,314
some dude fuck.

1629
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:27,310
A lot of dudes are annoying as shit
and women get horny and I'm like,

1630
00:41:27,311 --> 00:41:27,581
God,

1631
00:41:27,581 --> 00:41:28,271
I want someone to hug me,

1632
00:41:28,271 --> 00:41:31,120
but I don't want to just
idiot wrote a few shots back.

1633
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:31,630
Yeah,

1634
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:32,480
we all do that.

1635
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:33,350
Good.

1636
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:33,950
You know,

1637
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:37,080
I can understand it if it's like in
fraternities and sororities cause the,

1638
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:42,050
the rampant rape on college campuses is
insane right now because at that age is,

1639
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,490
nobody knows what the fuck they're doing.

1640
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:45,140
But like adults,

1641
00:41:45,141 --> 00:41:45,441
man,

1642
00:41:45,441 --> 00:41:47,480
like who's having sex without drinking?

1643
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:49,550
Seriously,

1644
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,740
like without some combination
of like wines and extra,

1645
00:41:54,741 --> 00:41:56,750
we'd like nobody's having sex.

1646
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:57,441
Sober people.

1647
00:41:57,441 --> 00:42:00,500
We would be Japan sober people.

1648
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:01,011
You know,

1649
00:42:01,011 --> 00:42:02,750
people who are like in
the program or something.

1650
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:04,160
Alcoholics anonymous people.

1651
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:07,400
What do they do it half are terrible sex.

1652
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:08,263
Go jogging,

1653
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:10,400
get a runner's high for us and then

1654
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,513
hold the breath,

1655
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:16,460
go spinning and then smash.

1656
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:17,903
Then you've got to shower.

1657
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:20,750
I ain't gotta shower twice
to fuck us up with that.

1658
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:21,691
Yeah,

1659
00:42:21,691 --> 00:42:25,820
I know the high might wear
off it as hard as the last,

1660
00:42:25,821 --> 00:42:27,290
nearly as long as I get an edible.

1661
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,090
Nice cold brew coffee.

1662
00:42:29,091 --> 00:42:29,924
Six.

1663
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:31,460
I would get crazy logs.

1664
00:42:31,461 --> 00:42:33,170
Y'All and dry mouth with coffee.

1665
00:42:33,171 --> 00:42:35,450
Sex are real for real.

1666
00:42:35,451 --> 00:42:38,120
If I drank coffee and
then she sat on my face,

1667
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:40,130
there would be serious problems.

1668
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,320
If you drink coffee,

1669
00:42:42,321 --> 00:42:44,780
your com is more likely
to get a girl pregnant.

1670
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:45,451
Really?

1671
00:42:45,451 --> 00:42:47,270
You know the sperm is more active drink,

1672
00:42:47,271 --> 00:42:48,104
green tea,

1673
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:48,591
green tea,

1674
00:42:48,591 --> 00:42:49,221
green tea,

1675
00:42:49,221 --> 00:42:49,490
even.

1676
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:50,270
Same thing.

1677
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:50,930
Caffeine.

1678
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:51,441
Oh really?

1679
00:42:51,441 --> 00:42:51,561
Yeah.

1680
00:42:51,561 --> 00:42:52,394
It's caffeine.

1681
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:54,680
Caffeine makes your spur more act.

1682
00:42:54,681 --> 00:42:55,390
That's for real thing.

1683
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:56,330
It's safe these days.

1684
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:56,960
Yeah.

1685
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,793
Nothing's fucking nothing.

1686
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,633
Say Nothing.

1687
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:01,520
There's nothing safe including sex.

1688
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:02,240
Yeah.

1689
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,880
Let's say so point being,

1690
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,070
don't tell this 12 year old kid the
wrong shit because as the climate becomes

1691
00:43:07,071 --> 00:43:09,200
more and more hostile towards men,

1692
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:13,250
it's going to get crazier and just really
think we should ask the twitters and

1693
00:43:13,251 --> 00:43:15,360
just don't be last Twitter ever.

1694
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:18,490
I'm just going to correct
this and tell him that.

1695
00:43:18,491 --> 00:43:21,170
Just stare and tell
her to watch your show.

1696
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:23,270
This stay offline.

1697
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,620
They'll Google your name.

1698
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,220
Doesn't exist.

1699
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:28,250
Just don't exist.

1700
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,113
Keep moving.

1701
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:30,380
Oh Man.

1702
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:32,190
Well the things that usually
get away with when you,

1703
00:43:32,191 --> 00:43:33,620
you know like natural boy,

1704
00:43:33,621 --> 00:43:34,730
girl type shit.

1705
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:35,330
It's like,

1706
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:35,840
you know,

1707
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,640
people take offense to that stuff now.

1708
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:38,331
Yeah,

1709
00:43:38,331 --> 00:43:39,440
like the anti whole thing.

1710
00:43:39,441 --> 00:43:39,980
When he just,

1711
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:41,030
he goes to grab her.

1712
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:41,901
I don't remember.

1713
00:43:41,901 --> 00:43:42,590
Annie Hall.

1714
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:42,711
Oh,

1715
00:43:42,711 --> 00:43:43,191
it was great.

1716
00:43:43,191 --> 00:43:43,581
He's like,

1717
00:43:43,581 --> 00:43:47,310
it's like Alvie singer as a kid and he
goes to kiss the girl and the girl's

1718
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:47,780
like,

1719
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:50,600
even throid talks about a latency period.

1720
00:43:50,601 --> 00:43:51,920
Alvey yeah.

1721
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:52,911
I don't remember.

1722
00:43:52,911 --> 00:43:54,530
It was so long ago.

1723
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:55,490
It's a great movie.

1724
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:56,480
Woody Allen,

1725
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,313
who's another one.

1726
00:43:57,470 --> 00:43:58,303
Yeah,

1727
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:00,500
free Bao bad example.

1728
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:03,270
I shouldn't put myself down.

1729
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:05,330
I'm saying this is just
change the subject.

1730
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:09,620
Have you ever seen those photos of woody
Allen with the girl on his lap when she

1731
00:44:09,621 --> 00:44:10,231
was a little girl,

1732
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:12,740
when he was the dad and then
the two of them together.

1733
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:14,360
The girl who,

1734
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:15,223
the girl,

1735
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:17,183
his wife,

1736
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:21,110
his wife now while she was sitting on
his lap when she was a little girl at a

1737
00:44:21,111 --> 00:44:25,130
basketball game and then many years
later she sitting next to him holding his

1738
00:44:25,131 --> 00:44:26,270
hand as his wife.

1739
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:26,961
It's crazy.

1740
00:44:26,961 --> 00:44:27,550
That's like,

1741
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:28,383
Yo,

1742
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:29,503
it's weird.

1743
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:32,070
Well that's seeing it laid out like

1744
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:32,341
that.

1745
00:44:32,341 --> 00:44:33,720
It's very dark.

1746
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:33,990
Yeah.

1747
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:35,490
It's like there's one thing,

1748
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,110
like if you hear about it like,

1749
00:44:37,111 --> 00:44:38,610
well maybe he didn't spend
a lot of time with her,

1750
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:43,620
but then you see the photo with her on
his lap at a basketball game and then,

1751
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:43,951
yeah,

1752
00:44:43,951 --> 00:44:45,030
and when you see them now,

1753
00:44:45,031 --> 00:44:45,870
even in the garden,

1754
00:44:45,871 --> 00:44:46,704
it's bugged.

1755
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:47,880
It's totally bugged out.

1756
00:44:47,881 --> 00:44:48,330
Yeah.

1757
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:49,770
It's amazing that he goes out with her.

1758
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:51,930
I mean that's got balls.

1759
00:44:51,931 --> 00:44:52,470
Yeah.

1760
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:53,850
I mean that guy's got crazy,

1761
00:44:53,851 --> 00:44:54,091
but oh,

1762
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:58,200
do you need to be ringside or we're
courtside that fucking pad with your

1763
00:44:58,201 --> 00:44:58,960
daughter or wife.

1764
00:44:58,960 --> 00:44:59,793
No,

1765
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:01,670
stay in the nose.

1766
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:02,700
Claim with your daughter.

1767
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:04,470
Wife didn't even go watch it.

1768
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:06,210
They have it on TV.

1769
00:45:06,211 --> 00:45:06,451
Yeah.

1770
00:45:06,451 --> 00:45:07,350
You got Voodoo.

1771
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:07,711
Yeah.

1772
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,550
What the fuck,

1773
00:45:08,551 --> 00:45:08,911
man?

1774
00:45:08,911 --> 00:45:10,620
It just seems like it's not a good move,

1775
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:11,161
but I don't,

1776
00:45:11,161 --> 00:45:12,300
I don't think people care.

1777
00:45:12,301 --> 00:45:13,920
He got no fucks given that dude.

1778
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:14,760
Just like,

1779
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:16,170
I think because of that,

1780
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:17,250
people don't care his,

1781
00:45:17,251 --> 00:45:18,780
I mean he just got a big deal.

1782
00:45:18,781 --> 00:45:20,510
I don't know if you read
about it like Amazon,

1783
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:21,930
Amazon TV deal,

1784
00:45:21,931 --> 00:45:26,850
like he's doing like shows for
Amazon now and even a thing,

1785
00:45:26,851 --> 00:45:27,480
you know.

1786
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:27,631
Well,

1787
00:45:27,631 --> 00:45:28,890
he's a really good director.

1788
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:32,340
He writes and directs
a new movie every year.

1789
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,470
Have you ever seen how
he does everything to,

1790
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:35,641
he does it all.

1791
00:45:35,641 --> 00:45:36,510
What a typewriter.

1792
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:37,410
No Way.

1793
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:38,190
Oh yeah,

1794
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:38,881
there's a video.

1795
00:45:38,881 --> 00:45:39,691
See if you pull it up,

1796
00:45:39,691 --> 00:45:40,140
Jeremy.

1797
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:40,411
There's a,

1798
00:45:40,411 --> 00:45:41,550
it's a fascinating video.

1799
00:45:41,551 --> 00:45:43,410
Woody Allen explaining
his writing process.

1800
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,520
He's got a video,

1801
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:45,720
he's got a typewriter,

1802
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:47,580
and then when he does changes,

1803
00:45:47,581 --> 00:45:49,530
when he doesn't need sort of a
change to one of his scripts,

1804
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:53,970
he cuts a piece of paper out and
fucking tape sits down over the other.

1805
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:54,833
The other place,

1806
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,610
I mean him and him and Wes Anderson,

1807
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,220
definitely my favorite director.

1808
00:45:58,221 --> 00:45:59,460
What do you owe on this typewriter?

1809
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,380
It's kind of fucking weird,

1810
00:46:01,381 --> 00:46:01,980
man.

1811
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:02,370
I mean,

1812
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:04,680
I think this is one of the
ways he avoids the Internet.

1813
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:07,200
This to stay sane

1814
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:09,140
house was always full of clarinet,

1815
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:09,540
reeds,

1816
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:10,373
ovary.

1817
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:15,850
It was 16 still works like a Tang and
it's a German typewriter and it's an

1818
00:46:19,131 --> 00:46:20,050
Olympia part of,

1819
00:46:20,051 --> 00:46:20,271
Oh,

1820
00:46:20,271 --> 00:46:23,270
I've had it my whole life.

1821
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:29,020
It cost me $40 I think the guy told me
it would be around long after my death

1822
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:32,410
and I've typed everything,

1823
00:46:32,411 --> 00:46:33,244
uh,

1824
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,760
that I've ever written,

1825
00:46:34,761 --> 00:46:35,750
every script,

1826
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:37,310
every New Yorker piece,

1827
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:39,800
everything I've ever done
on this type of that.

1828
00:46:39,801 --> 00:46:42,500
You used to have a metal
piece on top covering this,

1829
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:44,690
which I lost 30 years ago.

1830
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:49,480
One advantage obviously
to the word processors.

1831
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:51,200
You can electronically cut and paste.

1832
00:46:51,201 --> 00:46:52,760
What do you do when you
have to cut and paste?

1833
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:54,710
If I'm typing something,

1834
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:59,890
I have my scissors here and
I have a lot of these things,

1835
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:03,020
these little stapling machines.

1836
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,950
So if I'm typing something,

1837
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:11,110
I typed in the box like this and then
nobody is really tighten this stuff.

1838
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,800
It looks terrible on the page,

1839
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:19,370
so I have to type it because I have
arrows and all kinds of things,

1840
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:21,410
but when they come to a nice pile,

1841
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:27,470
then I cut that part off and
staple it on to something else.

1842
00:47:27,471 --> 00:47:28,730
With this time it's very,

1843
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:31,420
but it works.

1844
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:32,440
It works very well.

1845
00:47:32,441 --> 00:47:34,470
She is due to sewing screenplays,

1846
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,040
so there's no problem.

1847
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:41,853
How bizarre.

1848
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:42,730
I fucking love it.

1849
00:47:42,731 --> 00:47:43,630
I love this dude,

1850
00:47:43,631 --> 00:47:45,630
like he's just so I,

1851
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:49,120
I'd may be people if you can't
forgive any of that shit,

1852
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:50,013
it's really,

1853
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:51,370
really fucked up.

1854
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:56,080
I think people just aren't shocked by
it because he's such an idiosyncratic,

1855
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:56,914
like,

1856
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:57,783
yeah,

1857
00:47:57,790 --> 00:47:58,960
we are dude.

1858
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:00,550
It doesn't say nothing with him,

1859
00:48:00,551 --> 00:48:01,291
surprisingly,

1860
00:48:01,291 --> 00:48:02,110
but yeah.

1861
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:04,020
Well have you ever seen his old stand up?

1862
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:07,030
I have a record of his,

1863
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:07,881
like an old,

1864
00:48:07,881 --> 00:48:09,460
old record of his and eh,

1865
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:09,940
I mean he,

1866
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:10,751
it was pretty good.

1867
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:10,961
I mean,

1868
00:48:10,961 --> 00:48:12,670
it's like weird stories.

1869
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:12,821
Well,

1870
00:48:12,821 --> 00:48:14,110
he's a fucking pervert man.

1871
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:14,380
Yeah,

1872
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:16,400
he was always a perfect
this some stand up,

1873
00:48:16,401 --> 00:48:16,461
uh,

1874
00:48:16,461 --> 00:48:16,930
his,

1875
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:17,271
you know,

1876
00:48:17,271 --> 00:48:20,410
that stand up black and
white is near a staircase.

1877
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:21,610
It's from old,

1878
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:24,370
just look like rare woody Allen stand up.

1879
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:26,860
All his work is about sex and psychology,

1880
00:48:26,861 --> 00:48:27,420
all of it.

1881
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:27,921
And we'll,

1882
00:48:27,921 --> 00:48:29,140
with the younger women,

1883
00:48:29,141 --> 00:48:30,280
like that's like a theme.

1884
00:48:30,690 --> 00:48:31,690
He's a pervert man.

1885
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:32,441
Just like,

1886
00:48:32,441 --> 00:48:34,090
it's a rare old piece.

1887
00:48:34,091 --> 00:48:34,690
That's it.

1888
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:35,111
That's it.

1889
00:48:35,111 --> 00:48:36,160
65 rare.

1890
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:36,940
It's,

1891
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:37,780
it's hilarious.

1892
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:39,243
Listen to him talk.

1893
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:40,103
Is he the Bot,

1894
00:48:40,410 --> 00:48:41,860
which is this fabulous museum?

1895
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:42,703
A Bot.

1896
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:43,710
And when I was younger,

1897
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,450
I used to hang out a lot.

1898
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:50,720
The museum in search of a
meaningful social relationships.

1899
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:53,550
He used to look for girl

1900
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:57,630
I saw on the rural one,

1901
00:48:57,910 --> 00:48:58,221
uh,

1902
00:48:58,221 --> 00:49:00,090
no by Rubens,

1903
00:49:00,091 --> 00:49:02,010
but a real succulent nude

1904
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:07,310
huntress stabbing to death,

1905
00:49:07,311 --> 00:49:08,144
a war hawk.

1906
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:11,910
And I got very emotionally
involved with the painting,

1907
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:12,833
you know,

1908
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:14,820
to God had to restrain me.

1909
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:16,030
Alright,

1910
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:16,501
the lick,

1911
00:49:16,501 --> 00:49:17,870
some of the oil off the cap.

1912
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:23,390
Hi.

1913
00:49:23,390 --> 00:49:27,000
Where is it that I could meet the kind
of girl that would pose for that type

1914
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:29,050
picture I had in my neighborhood,

1915
00:49:29,051 --> 00:49:33,520
there's an art supply shop that deals
and offbeat things that I read it down

1916
00:49:33,521 --> 00:49:36,370
there and I get the name of
the oddest bottle off the wall.

1917
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:41,080
I call her up and I came on very
strong like an artist was it,

1918
00:49:41,081 --> 00:49:41,260
you know,

1919
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:42,880
I used a lot of 30 autistic terms.

1920
00:49:42,881 --> 00:49:43,960
Like right

1921
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:49,480
though I was just adorable
and we agreed on a price,

1922
00:49:49,481 --> 00:49:50,070
you know,

1923
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:50,903
hung up,

1924
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:54,800
rest stop and my Ma Baret you know,

1925
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:57,700
Harvey's Bristol cream on the hair

1926
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:00,941
too much.

1927
00:50:00,941 --> 00:50:01,774
What I want to be

1928
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:06,920
now or later.

1929
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:09,160
There's a knock on my
door and standing there,

1930
00:50:09,161 --> 00:50:10,480
just this fabulous woman,

1931
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:12,130
really sensational.

1932
00:50:12,730 --> 00:50:13,750
I let her in quickly,

1933
00:50:13,751 --> 00:50:14,050
you know,

1934
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:16,420
and I locked the door with my police,

1935
00:50:16,421 --> 00:50:21,130
lock the media and I said take
off your clothes right away.

1936
00:50:21,131 --> 00:50:24,100
Cause I don't know much about
art but I know what I like.

1937
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,690
So he was,

1938
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:31,780
he was always a creeper bed glance.

1939
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:32,690
Yeah.

1940
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:33,520
Graybar.

1941
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:33,770
I mean,

1942
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:34,640
which is getting bad,

1943
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:35,110
you know,

1944
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:35,260
she,

1945
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:35,770
yeah.

1946
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:36,350
Yeah.

1947
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:38,490
It's like that cause view
that Spanish fly bit.

1948
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:42,700
You what I mean like that was
toweling Cosby Spanish fly better,

1949
00:50:42,701 --> 00:50:42,950
right?

1950
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:43,783
Or easy.

1951
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:44,673
Yeah.

1952
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:45,051
Yeah.

1953
00:50:45,051 --> 00:50:45,884
Especially in that.

1954
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:48,950
And he talked about that on
more than one occasion to,

1955
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:49,550
Oh did he?

1956
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:49,641
Yeah.

1957
00:50:49,641 --> 00:50:52,640
There was another thing he talked about
Spanish fly in an interview who's doing

1958
00:50:52,641 --> 00:50:55,760
an interview with someone and he
talked about Spanish fly like yeah,

1959
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:57,890
like a casual interview panel,

1960
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,750
like do with doing panel on a talk show.

1961
00:51:00,110 --> 00:51:01,790
And he talked about Spanish fly.

1962
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:03,313
Oh man,

1963
00:51:03,870 --> 00:51:06,620
there's like a part of his daily life.

1964
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:09,860
I mean I wonder what the fuck that was.

1965
00:51:09,861 --> 00:51:10,101
You know,

1966
00:51:10,101 --> 00:51:10,581
he wouldn't it,

1967
00:51:10,581 --> 00:51:12,710
we're never going to
hear it from his mouth,

1968
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:15,080
which is too bad because I mean,

1969
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:19,130
it's almost like you ever see that
documentary iceman portrait of a serial

1970
00:51:19,131 --> 00:51:19,670
killer.

1971
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:20,091
No,

1972
00:51:20,091 --> 00:51:20,330
no,

1973
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:20,600
no.

1974
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,620
It's on Netflix though.

1975
00:51:21,621 --> 00:51:22,454
I know what you're talking about.

1976
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:27,500
Hbo Documentary where they sat down with
this guy who was a notorious Hitman,

1977
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:29,620
killed a bunch of people and uh,

1978
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:32,390
they sat down with them and talk
to them about how it started.

1979
00:51:32,391 --> 00:51:33,680
Who was the first person he killed,

1980
00:51:33,681 --> 00:51:34,890
what was his methods the whole day.

1981
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:38,330
And you hear the guy talk and you hear
his mentality and you understand where

1982
00:51:38,331 --> 00:51:38,961
he's coming from.

1983
00:51:38,961 --> 00:51:39,321
And he's like,

1984
00:51:39,321 --> 00:51:40,370
Whoa,

1985
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:44,570
well you can just have a glimpse into
the eyes of a monster and you kind of

1986
00:51:44,571 --> 00:51:49,571
understand like how it went down because
we don't often get a chance to hear

1987
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:52,790
interviews from serial
killers or Hitman or whatever,

1988
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:56,360
but to have Cosby sit down
if he ever did come clean,

1989
00:51:56,600 --> 00:52:01,010
like maybe if they ever did arrest him
and he came clean and he started talking

1990
00:52:01,011 --> 00:52:03,110
about what he did or why
he did it or you know,

1991
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:05,930
he couldn't help himself
or what was the impulse?

1992
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:06,891
I mean,

1993
00:52:06,891 --> 00:52:09,740
I can't imagine because
I don't think like that,

1994
00:52:09,741 --> 00:52:10,700
but it's just like maybe,

1995
00:52:10,701 --> 00:52:11,031
I don't know,

1996
00:52:11,031 --> 00:52:13,100
maybe some people think
they're entitled to Shit.

1997
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:14,023
That's where,

1998
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:14,981
that's where my bay,

1999
00:52:14,981 --> 00:52:15,320
right?

2000
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:18,830
That's my guess is that either you
have an impulse you can't control,

2001
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:22,760
but then it's like how can you have so
much control in the rest of your life?

2002
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,460
Then I start to think like
you have self control,

2003
00:52:25,461 --> 00:52:29,360
so it can't be an impulse thing has to
be that you feel you've justified this in

2004
00:52:29,361 --> 00:52:31,700
your mind and you feel entitled to this.

2005
00:52:31,970 --> 00:52:32,181
Well,

2006
00:52:32,181 --> 00:52:36,890
he has always been a guy that's been
known as being very arrogant and a guy who

2007
00:52:36,891 --> 00:52:40,010
is my manager met him and he had a very,

2008
00:52:40,011 --> 00:52:41,270
very poor opinion of him.

2009
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:42,680
He said a meeting and be like,

2010
00:52:42,681 --> 00:52:43,640
treats everybody like,

2011
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:47,270
like he's a king and like you're
supposed to have like a certain behavior

2012
00:52:47,271 --> 00:52:47,990
towards him.

2013
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:52,310
You ever see the shit on a lot of
younger black comics to always give him a

2014
00:52:52,311 --> 00:52:52,550
heart.

2015
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:53,001
All of them.

2016
00:52:53,001 --> 00:52:53,900
Everyone is dirty.

2017
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:54,763
Chris Rock,

2018
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:55,461
Eddie Murphy,

2019
00:52:55,461 --> 00:52:57,990
that famous bit that
Eddie Murphy did and uh,

2020
00:52:58,070 --> 00:53:02,330
Eddie Murphy raw where he talked about
he had to call up Richard Pryor cause

2021
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:05,900
bill Cosby saw his standup and
called them up and chastised them,

2022
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:06,831
you know,

2023
00:53:06,831 --> 00:53:10,370
and he called up Richard prior to ask
him for advice and bill Cosby because due

2024
00:53:10,371 --> 00:53:11,360
to people laugh,

2025
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:12,650
did you get paid?

2026
00:53:12,830 --> 00:53:15,650
Well tell bill to have a coke
and a smile and shut the fuck up.

2027
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:17,353
It's like,

2028
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:20,400
it's a famous famous quote fryer.

2029
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,070
I'm prior as the greatest,

2030
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:22,963
the greatest.

2031
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:26,130
I feel like there's two
greatest of time is I say,

2032
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:28,500
I always say that Sam Kinison
was the greatest for one year,

2033
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:29,131
for one year.

2034
00:53:29,131 --> 00:53:30,600
I don't think anybody was ever stronger,

2035
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:30,961
like,

2036
00:53:30,961 --> 00:53:34,020
especially like in that
time in 1986 or 1987.

2037
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:35,170
But he didn't sustain it.

2038
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:39,030
He just kept doing coke and fucking
is material went way downhill.

2039
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:42,420
But over the long term period of time
prior was the greatest and the most

2040
00:53:42,421 --> 00:53:44,390
influential has everything.

2041
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,260
Everything that most people would hide.

2042
00:53:46,261 --> 00:53:47,094
He just,

2043
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,290
it was onstage and just said it,

2044
00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:50,860
but he had nothing to hide.

2045
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:51,540
Well,

2046
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:52,380
he was a unique,

2047
00:53:52,381 --> 00:53:53,460
unique talent man.

2048
00:53:53,461 --> 00:53:54,480
Very unique guy.

2049
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:55,530
And you know,

2050
00:53:55,531 --> 00:54:00,531
he also was like unique in that he would
be real honest about his drug use and

2051
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:02,880
how the drug use thing was very,

2052
00:54:02,881 --> 00:54:05,400
that was a very big part of,

2053
00:54:05,401 --> 00:54:05,700
uh,

2054
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:06,510
his standup,

2055
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:07,110
you know,

2056
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:08,730
especially after he tried to kill himself,

2057
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:09,540
you know,

2058
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:11,370
and you never felt like
he was telling jokes.

2059
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:15,030
It really just felt like you're just a
naturally funny guy talking about tax

2060
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:15,873
shit.

2061
00:54:16,070 --> 00:54:16,411
Yeah.

2062
00:54:16,411 --> 00:54:16,741
Yeah.

2063
00:54:16,741 --> 00:54:19,120
It never felt like set up punchline,

2064
00:54:19,121 --> 00:54:19,410
so,

2065
00:54:19,410 --> 00:54:19,980
yeah.

2066
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:20,340
Yeah,

2067
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:20,551
yeah.

2068
00:54:20,551 --> 00:54:21,510
He was just talking,

2069
00:54:21,511 --> 00:54:21,791
you know,

2070
00:54:21,791 --> 00:54:23,570
it's even though you knew he was,

2071
00:54:23,571 --> 00:54:25,320
it's calculated in his delivery,

2072
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:30,600
it was just so comfortable and it's hard
to put it in perspective because back

2073
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:35,601
then if you listen to like some Cosby or
Richard Pryor rather from like 1981 or

2074
00:54:35,641 --> 00:54:36,211
something like that,

2075
00:54:36,211 --> 00:54:41,211
it's hard to put your brain back in 1981
because it was just a different time.

2076
00:54:41,341 --> 00:54:42,510
The world was young.

2077
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:42,810
It was,

2078
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:43,161
it was,

2079
00:54:43,161 --> 00:54:43,440
uh,

2080
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:47,310
the media had not had the same
influence that it has now.

2081
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:49,920
Do you think your show,

2082
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:50,940
do you ever wonder like,

2083
00:54:50,941 --> 00:54:51,630
man,

2084
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:54,270
like your show going to get
fucked with cause it's censored.

2085
00:54:54,271 --> 00:54:57,930
And do you ever think like maybe
it would have been a free or shelf?

2086
00:54:57,930 --> 00:55:00,210
I did it on showtime or HBO.

2087
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:00,650
Did you,

2088
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:01,710
did you think about doing it?

2089
00:55:01,990 --> 00:55:05,280
He got offers from other
production companies and um,

2090
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:05,941
you know,

2091
00:55:05,941 --> 00:55:08,700
th the thing for me was I
wanted to fight this battle.

2092
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:12,030
I wanted to take the story to
network television and be like,

2093
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:12,810
let's,

2094
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:14,550
let's take this to western Michigan.

2095
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:15,151
You know,

2096
00:55:15,151 --> 00:55:16,920
like going to cable,

2097
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,180
that's preaching to the choir.

2098
00:55:18,181 --> 00:55:19,080
That's me,

2099
00:55:19,081 --> 00:55:19,471
you,

2100
00:55:19,471 --> 00:55:19,951
Randall,

2101
00:55:19,951 --> 00:55:20,551
my friends,

2102
00:55:20,551 --> 00:55:22,020
we all watch showtime,

2103
00:55:22,021 --> 00:55:22,854
Hbo,

2104
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:23,821
Netflix,

2105
00:55:23,821 --> 00:55:24,301
and you know,

2106
00:55:24,301 --> 00:55:25,380
I have the vice show,

2107
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:29,520
but there's a huge difference in the
people we're going to reach with this show

2108
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:30,450
and my vice show.

2109
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:31,800
Is that vice show the same name?

2110
00:55:32,090 --> 00:55:32,470
Uh,

2111
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:32,641
no.

2112
00:55:32,641 --> 00:55:33,290
They change will.

2113
00:55:33,290 --> 00:55:34,830
They bought the name from vice,

2114
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:36,260
so yeah.

2115
00:55:36,410 --> 00:55:37,020
Yeah.

2116
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:39,360
I had licensed it to vice and then it got,

2117
00:55:39,390 --> 00:55:40,620
it got sold over,

2118
00:55:40,621 --> 00:55:41,520
but it's cool.

2119
00:55:41,521 --> 00:55:44,310
Vice was awesome because
ABC needed the name.

2120
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:45,390
Who was the name of the book?

2121
00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:47,400
And for me it was,

2122
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:47,940
they were,

2123
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:51,450
they were calling it four
East Orlando Far East Orlando.

2124
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:53,250
If it wasn't such a bad name,

2125
00:55:53,310 --> 00:55:55,440
I wouldn't have taken the
name from the vice show.

2126
00:55:55,470 --> 00:55:56,580
But you know,

2127
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,230
Shane and those guys are great man.

2128
00:55:58,231 --> 00:55:59,520
Like they really did me a favor.

2129
00:55:59,521 --> 00:56:00,510
They didn't have to do that.

2130
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:02,400
And that's why I fuck with them.

2131
00:56:02,401 --> 00:56:04,050
So heavy chain doesn't give a fuck.

2132
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:04,771
He doesn't give a fuck.

2133
00:56:04,771 --> 00:56:05,281
He does it right.

2134
00:56:05,281 --> 00:56:06,720
The gentleman he doesn't give a shame,

2135
00:56:06,721 --> 00:56:08,370
does the right thing all the time.

2136
00:56:08,371 --> 00:56:09,120
I love that dude.

2137
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:09,391
Yeah.

2138
00:56:09,391 --> 00:56:11,640
And like I'm very critical of,

2139
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:12,000
you know,

2140
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,970
my experience with 20th
and ABC and those things.

2141
00:56:14,971 --> 00:56:15,810
But you know,

2142
00:56:15,811 --> 00:56:16,630
I would never lie.

2143
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:18,580
Like I'm not just here to
say nice things about vice.

2144
00:56:18,590 --> 00:56:20,040
Those dudes always come through.

2145
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,233
They always do.

2146
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,051
They do the right thing.

2147
00:56:22,051 --> 00:56:24,070
And so we put it ABC cause I was like,

2148
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:25,690
we can't go out with foist Orlando.

2149
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,040
Then name was fucked.

2150
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:29,993
Sorry.

2151
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:32,410
What does that even mean?

2152
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:33,513
Yeah.

2153
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,450
Chinks life dreams.

2154
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:37,540
Where dreamworks,

2155
00:56:37,541 --> 00:56:38,374
the Chinks Life.

2156
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:40,060
Did you grow up in Orlando?

2157
00:56:40,061 --> 00:56:40,840
Is that why they did it?

2158
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:41,410
Yeah,

2159
00:56:41,410 --> 00:56:41,801
I was,

2160
00:56:41,801 --> 00:56:42,161
yeah,

2161
00:56:42,161 --> 00:56:43,450
it takes place in Orlando.

2162
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:43,760
Yeah.

2163
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,940
Like in the 90s was a dark place.

2164
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:48,130
Dark fucking place of people don't know.

2165
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:48,580
No,

2166
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:51,700
you got Disneyland and then everything
that's outside of Disneyland.

2167
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:52,030
Yeah,

2168
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:52,870
very strange.

2169
00:56:52,871 --> 00:56:56,770
I took a lot of ecstasy to
stay positive in Orlando.

2170
00:56:56,771 --> 00:56:57,604
Yeah.

2171
00:56:57,810 --> 00:56:58,210
But you,

2172
00:56:58,210 --> 00:56:58,570
you,

2173
00:56:58,570 --> 00:57:00,340
when did you develop the New York accent?

2174
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:01,833
I've always been,

2175
00:57:01,870 --> 00:57:03,070
I've always talked like this.

2176
00:57:03,130 --> 00:57:04,330
It's super fucking weird.

2177
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:05,290
It's just in the hip hop.

2178
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:06,760
I think it's hip hop.

2179
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:09,250
It's watching so much basketball and then,

2180
00:57:09,251 --> 00:57:10,084
um,

2181
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:10,600
it's,

2182
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,850
my parents don't speak English at home,

2183
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:14,560
so my English is learned.

2184
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:17,080
So in a way I think it's,

2185
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:19,110
you choose the way you talk,

2186
00:57:19,150 --> 00:57:19,983
right?

2187
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:21,053
Yeah.

2188
00:57:21,330 --> 00:57:22,160
So it's,

2189
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,650
it's just I want all I did,

2190
00:57:23,651 --> 00:57:25,510
I just watched gangster movies,

2191
00:57:25,511 --> 00:57:26,261
listen to hip hop,

2192
00:57:26,261 --> 00:57:27,220
watch basketball,

2193
00:57:27,221 --> 00:57:27,880
and it's,

2194
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:28,361
it is what,

2195
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:29,890
it always sounded like this,

2196
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:31,080
that's an interesting man.

2197
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,920
Even when I was in Orlando,

2198
00:57:33,190 --> 00:57:34,420
I remember there was a few girls,

2199
00:57:34,421 --> 00:57:34,631
I was like,

2200
00:57:34,631 --> 00:57:35,351
you from Brooklyn?

2201
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:36,590
And I was no,

2202
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:38,470
DC,

2203
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:39,303
Orlando,

2204
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:40,151
Pittsburgh.

2205
00:57:40,151 --> 00:57:41,740
And then I've been in New York,

2206
00:57:41,741 --> 00:57:43,030
Brooklyn for like 10 years.

2207
00:57:43,031 --> 00:57:47,150
So then it just crystallized it for me.

2208
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:51,270
How long you allowed to like how long do
you have to live in a place before you

2209
00:57:51,271 --> 00:57:52,104
accept the accent?

2210
00:57:53,350 --> 00:57:53,651
You know,

2211
00:57:53,651 --> 00:57:54,100
man,

2212
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:57,880
like if you're from Georgia and then you
moved to New Jersey and then you start

2213
00:57:57,881 --> 00:58:00,310
talking like you're from New Jersey
and then you go back to Georgia,

2214
00:58:00,311 --> 00:58:00,701
they're going to go,

2215
00:58:00,701 --> 00:58:01,960
what the fuck man.

2216
00:58:02,290 --> 00:58:02,861
But you know,

2217
00:58:02,861 --> 00:58:04,900
even if you spend a week in Atlanta,

2218
00:58:04,930 --> 00:58:09,760
because in Atlanta you just tossed it
just sizzurp and alcohol all weekend and

2219
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:10,420
you get,

2220
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:12,600
you get so faded that you,

2221
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,770
I end up saying things a little weird.

2222
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:16,060
Even after a week in Atlanta,

2223
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:18,020
you get that fucked up
and you go to Atlanta.

2224
00:58:18,021 --> 00:58:19,300
I get fucked up in Atlanta,

2225
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:21,910
shouts to cooker,

2226
00:58:21,950 --> 00:58:23,100
arrived my man cooker.

2227
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:24,470
We went out to follies last time.

2228
00:58:24,471 --> 00:58:25,304
It was awesome.

2229
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:27,850
So sizzurp that's that
shit with coding in it.

2230
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:28,900
Yeah.

2231
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:29,980
Yeah.

2232
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:30,813

There is no closet that the guy asap yams

2236
00:58:39,401 --> 00:58:40,150

2238
00:58:42,271 --> 00:58:46,750
he had this crew called the blackout
boys and it's like my boy Ron had a tee

2239
00:58:46,751 --> 00:58:47,170

2245
00:58:58,940 --> 00:58:59,140
No,

2246
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:00,040
they haven't said why.

2247
00:59:00,041 --> 00:59:00,400
Yeah,

2248
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:00,851
but you know,

2249
00:59:00,851 --> 00:59:01,601

2250
00:59:01,601 --> 00:59:03,310

2258
00:59:12,941 --> 00:59:16,630
I've talked about on the podcast before

2292
01:00:02,301 --> 01:00:02,840

2304
01:00:16,911 --> 01:00:19,010
But like people know how old was he?

2305
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:20,060

2309
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:24,711

01:00:32,361 --> 01:00:32,571

2317
01:00:32,571 --> 01:00:33,140
it's,

2318
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:33,980
it's pretty dangerous.

2319
01:00:33,981 --> 01:00:34,850
It'll creep up on you.

2320
01:00:34,851 --> 01:00:36,110
You think it's just cough syrup,

2321
01:00:36,111 --> 01:00:37,250
but it'll creep up on you.

2322
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:38,743
Wow.

2323
01:00:38,870 --> 01:00:39,490
Damn,

2324
01:00:39,490 --> 01:00:39,930

2325
01:00:39,930 --> 01:00:41,960
that's a thing that with
the youth today though,

2326
01:00:41,961 --> 01:00:44,330
I know there's a lot of kids
that are drinking concert.

2327
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:45,343
Yeah.

2328
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,990
I mean I did it growing up
and like not all the time.

2329
01:00:47,991 --> 01:00:51,170
Maybe like once or twice a
year or something like that.

2330
01:00:51,590 --> 01:00:54,320
But I never saw it as that serious.

2331
01:00:54,321 --> 01:00:55,870
But now you start to see people pass.

2332
01:00:55,940 --> 01:00:56,773
It's serious.

2333
01:00:57,050 --> 01:00:57,831
You know what?

2334
01:00:57,831 --> 01:00:59,030
They're doing it probably every day.

2335
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:00,441
I'm not sure,

2336
01:01:00,441 --> 01:01:00,920
man.

2337
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:01,730
I'm not sure.

2338
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:02,930
It's just not to be fucked with.

2339
01:01:02,931 --> 01:01:03,260
I don't,

2340
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:04,760
I also people,

2341
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:05,990
people in Philly like,

2342
01:01:06,050 --> 01:01:06,850
um,

2343
01:01:06,850 --> 01:01:07,220
Harlem,

2344
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:08,510
you'll do pancakes and syrup,

2345
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:12,500
which is you dropped his annex into the
coding and then that's just good night.

2346
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:13,940
Oh my God,

2347
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:14,803
that's good night.

2348
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:15,440
Hallmark.

2349
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:16,273
God,

2350
01:01:16,370 --> 01:01:21,370
we were in Boston two weeks ago and there
was this dude that was fucked up and

2351
01:01:22,521 --> 01:01:26,270
he was standing in front of the w
hotel and you're standing there,

2352
01:01:26,271 --> 01:01:29,900
his pants were like half falling down
and it just kept leaning forward.

2353
01:01:29,930 --> 01:01:31,400
Like he was going to face plant.

2354
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:31,551
Well,

2355
01:01:31,551 --> 01:01:32,181
like he's gone down,

2356
01:01:32,181 --> 01:01:35,690
he's going down and he would catch himself
and then he moved forward every time

2357
01:01:35,691 --> 01:01:39,260
he did it to the point where he was in
the middle of the fucking road in the

2358
01:01:39,261 --> 01:01:40,070
middle of the road,

2359
01:01:40,070 --> 01:01:41,030
which is fucked up.

2360
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:42,080
And then leaning forward.

2361
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:42,930
And uh,

2362
01:01:42,930 --> 01:01:43,521
my friend was like,

2363
01:01:43,521 --> 01:01:44,061
he's drunk.

2364
01:01:44,061 --> 01:01:44,391
And I'm like,

2365
01:01:44,391 --> 01:01:45,830
that guy is not drunk.

2366
01:01:46,450 --> 01:01:49,190
That is some next level
shit that's not drunk.

2367
01:01:49,550 --> 01:01:51,410
He's on some pills or something.

2368
01:01:51,950 --> 01:01:52,640
Yeah,

2369
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:55,310
but he kept leaning forward
and then we're like,

2370
01:01:55,311 --> 01:01:55,830
he's going,

2371
01:01:55,830 --> 01:01:57,650
hey face plant catch himself.

2372
01:01:57,830 --> 01:01:59,270
We've watched him like five minutes.

2373
01:01:59,510 --> 01:02:00,111
My friend was like,

2374
01:02:00,111 --> 01:02:00,651
rescue him.

2375
01:02:00,651 --> 01:02:01,830
Like what you rescue him?

2376
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:03,140
Rescue in that guy.

2377
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:04,131
You rescue that guy.

2378
01:02:04,131 --> 01:02:06,530
You got to go back to his
childhood figuring out what
the fuck made him the way

2379
01:02:06,531 --> 01:02:07,041
he is.

2380
01:02:07,041 --> 01:02:08,870
You got to take a time machine,

2381
01:02:09,050 --> 01:02:09,980
kill his parents.

2382
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:11,450
You know there's a lot of shit.

2383
01:02:11,451 --> 01:02:12,650
You got to do the rescue that guy.

2384
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:13,963
Yeah.

2385
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:15,680
It'll put the hooks in you man.

2386
01:02:15,681 --> 01:02:18,440
Like that's why you know
kids don't do drugs.

2387
01:02:18,770 --> 01:02:19,603
Right.

2388
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:21,660
It's rough man.

2389
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:22,793
It's rough.

2390
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:23,713
You not need it.

2391
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:24,990
He just smoked some weed kids.

2392
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:25,350
Yeah.

2393
01:02:25,350 --> 01:02:26,680
I don't even really smell weed that,

2394
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:28,470
I mean I smoked like three nights ago,

2395
01:02:28,471 --> 01:02:30,750
but I've stopped having weed in the crib.

2396
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:31,980
Like I'll smoke when I'm out.

2397
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:33,070
Yeah,

2398
01:02:33,070 --> 01:02:38,070
because I noticed like I went to some
family shit and I noticed I would get

2399
01:02:38,611 --> 01:02:40,110
really depressed when I smoked.

2400
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:41,970
Like it would just make me
depressed and I was like,

2401
01:02:41,971 --> 01:02:43,230
this really is a depressant,

2402
01:02:43,890 --> 01:02:48,090
so I just switched socially now in one
way or the images or like when I'm really

2403
01:02:48,091 --> 01:02:50,040
sad about like when
there's something going on,

2404
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:52,740
I feel like I don't have
my own self control.

2405
01:02:53,190 --> 01:02:54,300
If I'm smoking weed,

2406
01:02:54,301 --> 01:02:56,820
like I can control the
emotions and block things out,

2407
01:02:56,821 --> 01:03:00,360
but once I smoke weed it's just like
it'll hit you or makes you hyper aware.

2408
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:00,991
Yes.

2409
01:03:00,991 --> 01:03:01,770
Super aware.

2410
01:03:01,770 --> 01:03:02,250
Yeah.

2411
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:04,700
Wallow in it sometimes does.

2412
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:06,210
That's not protecting you,

2413
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:07,440
but I always feel like it's the,

2414
01:03:08,110 --> 01:03:11,970
the plant is trying to let me know all
the real shit that I'm dealing with and

2415
01:03:11,971 --> 01:03:14,160
all the dangers of all the
shit that I'm dealing with,

2416
01:03:14,161 --> 01:03:14,790
so it makes,

2417
01:03:14,790 --> 01:03:18,210
that's like what we're paranoia comes
from when people say weed makes me

2418
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:18,661
paranoid,

2419
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:18,901
I'm like,

2420
01:03:18,901 --> 01:03:20,520
we should be fucking paranoid.

2421
01:03:20,521 --> 01:03:22,740
If you're paying attention
to the weed is doing,

2422
01:03:22,741 --> 01:03:24,690
is letting you aware,

2423
01:03:24,890 --> 01:03:29,280
be letting you become aware of all the
variables that may be pushing aside or

2424
01:03:29,281 --> 01:03:30,300
putting blinders on.

2425
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:30,900
Yeah.

2426
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:32,780
I think I just been stressed lately.

2427
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:36,240
Lot of shit going on in
my life and I was like,

2428
01:03:36,241 --> 01:03:37,074
Whoa,

2429
01:03:37,110 --> 01:03:37,710
I can't,

2430
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:39,960
I can't look at all of this 24 hours.

2431
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:42,450
I have to be able to
just get away from this.

2432
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:43,740
And when I was smoking weed,

2433
01:03:43,770 --> 01:03:44,550
it was like,

2434
01:03:44,550 --> 01:03:45,211
Kaboom,

2435
01:03:45,211 --> 01:03:46,530
you just unmarinated in it.

2436
01:03:47,070 --> 01:03:47,410
And I was like,

2437
01:03:47,410 --> 01:03:47,940
I can't,

2438
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:48,900
I can't do this man.

2439
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:53,940
So I got it out of the house now
just smoking when I'm with friends,

2440
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:54,510
you know.

2441
01:03:54,510 --> 01:03:55,110
There you go.

2442
01:03:55,110 --> 01:03:55,680
That's a smart,

2443
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:57,320
well I think I'll everything you know,

2444
01:03:57,330 --> 01:03:58,170
you need moderation.

2445
01:03:58,171 --> 01:04:00,780
You can't just be high all day every day.

2446
01:04:01,050 --> 01:04:02,460
The [inaudible] breaks before too,

2447
01:04:02,461 --> 01:04:02,730
right?

2448
01:04:02,730 --> 01:04:03,061
Oh yeah,

2449
01:04:03,061 --> 01:04:03,810
I take weeks.

2450
01:04:03,810 --> 01:04:04,320
Yeah,

2451
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:05,370
I'll take weeks off of it.

2452
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:06,383
Yeah,

2453
01:04:06,390 --> 01:04:07,710
go on vacation or whatever.

2454
01:04:07,711 --> 01:04:08,640
I always take breaks.

2455
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:11,040
I've never gotten
anything from smoking it,

2456
01:04:11,130 --> 01:04:11,963
but like I,

2457
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:16,080
I've been like eating it on occasion and
I know some shit right here and we'll

2458
01:04:16,081 --> 01:04:18,660
get you something
totally different eating.

2459
01:04:18,661 --> 01:04:20,010
I feel good eating it,

2460
01:04:20,250 --> 01:04:21,010
but okay.

2461
01:04:21,010 --> 01:04:21,690
It just doesn't do it.

2462
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:21,841
Well,

2463
01:04:21,841 --> 01:04:24,690
I'll explain it because I've explained
it a million times in the podcast.

2464
01:04:24,691 --> 01:04:25,520
People are tired of hearing that,

2465
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:26,101
but when you eat it,

2466
01:04:26,101 --> 01:04:27,090
it's a totally different drug.

2467
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:28,021
When you eat it,

2468
01:04:28,021 --> 01:04:31,140
it's process by your liver and it
becomes something called 11 hydroxy

2469
01:04:31,141 --> 01:04:31,820
metabolite.

2470
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:34,560
It's four to five times
more psychoactive than THC,

2471
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,060
but it's a totally different truck.

2472
01:04:36,061 --> 01:04:37,170
It's way more powerful.

2473
01:04:37,530 --> 01:04:42,530
That's why you can have like one of those
little 75 milligram THC candies or 15

2474
01:04:43,051 --> 01:04:45,720
you can have a 15 milligram
THC few Joey Diaz.

2475
01:04:45,721 --> 01:04:50,210
He go with the 75 those
15 milligram THC candies.

2476
01:04:50,211 --> 01:04:51,690
It just give you a nice feeling,

2477
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:52,410
man.

2478
01:04:52,410 --> 01:04:52,910
Good.

2479
01:04:52,910 --> 01:04:53,610
Yeah.

2480
01:04:53,610 --> 01:04:54,770
Relax there.

2481
01:04:54,810 --> 01:04:56,940
You ironman with the eating because I,

2482
01:04:56,941 --> 01:04:57,571
if I eat,

2483
01:04:57,571 --> 01:04:59,520
I bug a bug out.

2484
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:00,930
I can smoke.

2485
01:05:00,990 --> 01:05:02,430
It's about the volume.

2486
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:02,791
It's like,

2487
01:05:02,791 --> 01:05:02,940
yeah,

2488
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:06,000
you just got to get the right
guy to sell you the right amount.

2489
01:05:06,001 --> 01:05:06,691
That's what it is.

2490
01:05:06,691 --> 01:05:08,040
The right amount is,

2491
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:13,080
I feel like 20 milligrams is good and
you get crazy and you start getting into

2492
01:05:13,081 --> 01:05:15,150
50 and 75 and you know.

2493
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:15,960
Yeah,

2494
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:17,260
I know dudes who go deep,

2495
01:05:17,290 --> 01:05:18,130
like my friend Joey,

2496
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:18,880
he goes deep.

2497
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:19,240
Joey,

2498
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:21,420
Joey chomp to one fifty's.

2499
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:22,690
Wow.

2500
01:05:22,690 --> 01:05:23,523
Yeah,

2501
01:05:23,690 --> 01:05:23,881
yeah,

2502
01:05:23,881 --> 01:05:24,070
yeah.

2503
01:05:24,070 --> 01:05:25,950
He'll have panic attacks and
she didn't have no planes.

2504
01:05:26,310 --> 01:05:27,030
I ate,

2505
01:05:27,030 --> 01:05:32,030
I ate at Endeca beef jerky and I ate the
whole jerky myself was supposed to be

2506
01:05:32,811 --> 01:05:36,430
the host between like a couple
people and I thought I died.

2507
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:37,450
I woke up my brother,

2508
01:05:37,451 --> 01:05:38,770
I thought I died and I was like,

2509
01:05:38,771 --> 01:05:39,604
I'm a ghost,

2510
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:42,130
I'm going to take me to the hospital.

2511
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:46,150
And he took me to the hospital and I'm
doing jumping jacks in the emergency

2512
01:05:46,170 --> 01:05:47,003
room,

2513
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:48,220
straight jumping jacks.

2514
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:48,671
And they're like,

2515
01:05:48,671 --> 01:05:50,740
why are you doing
jumping jacks and the er?

2516
01:05:50,741 --> 01:05:51,100
And I was like,

2517
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:52,120
I need to feel alive.

2518
01:05:52,390 --> 01:05:53,890
I need to fill up my hardest money.

2519
01:05:54,390 --> 01:05:55,211
I was say if I stop,

2520
01:05:55,211 --> 01:05:56,044
I'm going to die.

2521
01:05:56,140 --> 01:05:57,790
And the doctor rolled up on me,

2522
01:05:57,791 --> 01:05:58,450
he's like sand,

2523
01:05:58,450 --> 01:05:59,710
there's nothing I can do for you.

2524
01:05:59,890 --> 01:06:00,640
I could really,

2525
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:00,941
really,

2526
01:06:00,941 --> 01:06:01,870
I'm doing jumping jacks.

2527
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:02,620
And he's like,

2528
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:04,210
I have one piece of advice and I'll go,

2529
01:06:04,211 --> 01:06:04,631
what is it?

2530
01:06:04,631 --> 01:06:05,140
He goes,

2531
01:06:05,140 --> 01:06:06,010
if you're going to eat,

2532
01:06:06,011 --> 01:06:07,810
we'd don't be such a pussy about it.

2533
01:06:08,470 --> 01:06:13,120
Oh but it got me sober because I was like,

2534
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:14,171
yeah,

2535
01:06:14,171 --> 01:06:15,600
the doctor woke me out of it.

2536
01:06:15,601 --> 01:06:17,320
Cause are all of a sudden I was like,

2537
01:06:17,321 --> 01:06:17,561
wait,

2538
01:06:17,561 --> 01:06:18,640
so you say I'm not going to die?

2539
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:18,851
He goes,

2540
01:06:18,851 --> 01:06:20,530
you're not going to die
if you stop being a pussy.

2541
01:06:20,531 --> 01:06:21,340
Just stop it.

2542
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:21,701
Wow.

2543
01:06:21,701 --> 01:06:22,700
This doctor said this.

2544
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:24,640
How old was the doctor do?

2545
01:06:24,641 --> 01:06:26,830
He was like a 40 year old white dude.

2546
01:06:26,831 --> 01:06:27,970
Really cool in Houston.

2547
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:29,800
I did this on the road in Houston.

2548
01:06:29,801 --> 01:06:31,240
This Hughes.

2549
01:06:31,350 --> 01:06:31,580
Yeah.

2550
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:33,580
I don't need to be in Houston and Atlanta.

2551
01:06:33,581 --> 01:06:34,450
I just get in trouble.

2552
01:06:36,010 --> 01:06:36,671
Why Houston?

2553
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:37,280
Atlanta.

2554
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:37,870
You could,

2555
01:06:37,870 --> 01:06:38,920
you could just get it.

2556
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:41,710
I had like a leader of something.

2557
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:43,900
It was some sorta like vodka,

2558
01:06:43,901 --> 01:06:44,860
some shitty Varga.

2559
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:48,460
We rolled up to the smoothie king cause
you could get the smoothie king drive

2560
01:06:48,461 --> 01:06:49,050
through,

2561
01:06:49,050 --> 01:06:49,541
dump out,

2562
01:06:49,541 --> 01:06:50,530
have your smoothie,

2563
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:53,610
fill the rest with vodka and
scissor and then just goodnight.

2564
01:06:54,070 --> 01:06:55,180
Oh yeah.

2565
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:56,860
There's a place in West Palm does the,

2566
01:06:56,890 --> 01:06:57,580
the uh,

2567
01:06:57,580 --> 01:06:59,500
Improv in west palm was right.

2568
01:06:59,740 --> 01:07:01,360
It was connected to this place.

2569
01:07:01,361 --> 01:07:02,500
I forget the name of it,

2570
01:07:02,501 --> 01:07:05,100
but they used to have these
drinks that were like,

2571
01:07:05,110 --> 01:07:05,410
ah,

2572
01:07:05,410 --> 01:07:06,243
it was like,

2573
01:07:06,670 --> 01:07:07,311
like a,

2574
01:07:07,311 --> 01:07:08,830
a wake of frosty.

2575
01:07:08,831 --> 01:07:08,981
Like,

2576
01:07:08,981 --> 01:07:09,880
what are those things like,

2577
01:07:09,881 --> 01:07:10,091
you know,

2578
01:07:10,091 --> 01:07:14,050
you'd get them at the movie theater but
you know they're fucking those slushy.

2579
01:07:14,051 --> 01:07:14,860
Slushy,

2580
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:15,281
slushy.

2581
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:15,610
Yeah,

2582
01:07:15,610 --> 01:07:20,200
but there were alcohol and there was one
called call a cab because if you drank

2583
01:07:20,201 --> 01:07:21,100
it you need to call a cab.

2584
01:07:21,430 --> 01:07:25,030
It was like five drinks in one drank like
five drinks worth of alcohol in one of

2585
01:07:25,031 --> 01:07:27,550
these fucking things and
you would drink it and it,

2586
01:07:27,570 --> 01:07:30,130
you didn't know what you were
drinking because it was so sweet,

2587
01:07:30,370 --> 01:07:33,790
like as you were drinking and it didn't
feel like that is a slight alcohol taste

2588
01:07:33,791 --> 01:07:34,624
to it,

2589
01:07:34,690 --> 01:07:39,670
but good law you but make some fucking
poor decisions after that shit.

2590
01:07:40,850 --> 01:07:41,800
And when I was younger,

2591
01:07:41,801 --> 01:07:42,610
you just get up,

2592
01:07:42,610 --> 01:07:43,670
you'd be in another town,

2593
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:43,961
you're like,

2594
01:07:43,961 --> 01:07:44,171
Yo,

2595
01:07:44,171 --> 01:07:44,921
we in Atlanta,

2596
01:07:44,921 --> 01:07:45,491
we yo,

2597
01:07:45,491 --> 01:07:45,890
let's,

2598
01:07:45,890 --> 01:07:46,960
let's wild out.

2599
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:50,830
Twice a year I would just
be like on my lights out,

2600
01:07:50,831 --> 01:07:51,664
dance shit.

2601
01:07:51,730 --> 01:07:52,563
Right.

2602
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:53,950
It's time to do the lights out.

2603
01:07:53,951 --> 01:07:54,784
Dance.

2604
01:07:56,450 --> 01:07:57,660
That's when you call blacking out.

2605
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:01,090
Sean Merriman played for the charges.

2606
01:08:01,091 --> 01:08:03,730
He was doing the crazy like
lights out dance and I was like,

2607
01:08:03,731 --> 01:08:03,941
Yo,

2608
01:08:03,941 --> 01:08:05,500
I'm about to do the lights out dance.

2609
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:07,960
But I had the chill man after that.

2610
01:08:07,961 --> 01:08:08,794
I was like,

2611
01:08:08,890 --> 01:08:09,940
I'm too old for this shit.

2612
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:11,531
Very,

2613
01:08:11,531 --> 01:08:12,730
very bad for the liver.

2614
01:08:12,910 --> 01:08:13,740
Yeah,

2615
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:14,200
that's the,

2616
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:15,033
you gotta get out of hand.

2617
01:08:15,230 --> 01:08:16,063
Randall's gotta go.

2618
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:17,020
Wouldn't let them out.

2619
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:17,660
Okay.

2620
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:18,231
Thanks so much.

2621
01:08:18,231 --> 01:08:18,980
Thanks Randall.

2622
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:19,813
Man.

2623
01:08:20,210 --> 01:08:21,090
Appreciate it man.

2624
01:08:21,580 --> 01:08:24,050
I gotta pick up my daughter.

2625
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:26,133
Keep it where it sir.

2626
01:08:26,150 --> 01:08:26,630
I'll talk.

2627
01:08:26,630 --> 01:08:27,463
I'll talk you soon.

2628
01:08:28,090 --> 01:08:28,731
Thanks so much.

2629
01:08:28,731 --> 01:08:30,170
That should be on the show of course.

2630
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:31,393
And good luck man.

2631
01:08:32,690 --> 01:08:34,940
Good luck with all that
North Korea shit to son now.

2632
01:08:34,941 --> 01:08:36,590
He's the best dude for real.

2633
01:08:36,770 --> 01:08:38,420
The fucking hung out with
them before the show.

2634
01:08:38,421 --> 01:08:39,040
He's a good dude.

2635
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:39,873
Yeah.

2636
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,200
That's a crazy position to be in,

2637
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:41,480
man.

2638
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:46,480
To play a dictator that gets banned
that Sony is so scared of it.

2639
01:08:46,821 --> 01:08:48,260
They pull it out of the movie theater.

2640
01:08:48,350 --> 01:08:49,183
Yeah.

2641
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:53,030
I have so much respect for him because
you meet a lot of people who they'll do

2642
01:08:53,031 --> 01:08:54,170
anything for a role.

2643
01:08:54,650 --> 01:08:55,483
He's like,

2644
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:57,920
he was trying to like give
his roll back and be like,

2645
01:08:57,950 --> 01:08:59,240
I don't think I'm the one for this.

2646
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:00,200
That's amazing.

2647
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:00,681
I was like,

2648
01:09:00,681 --> 01:09:04,520
I've never seen honor like this
from anybody in this industry.

2649
01:09:04,521 --> 01:09:05,990
So I mean he's,

2650
01:09:05,991 --> 01:09:06,680
he's for real.

2651
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:06,861
Yeah.

2652
01:09:06,861 --> 01:09:08,870
That's amazing that he made that decision.

2653
01:09:08,910 --> 01:09:09,190
Well the,

2654
01:09:09,190 --> 01:09:14,190
it's amazing that the movie freaked
them out less than the show.

2655
01:09:14,380 --> 01:09:15,213
Yeah.

2656
01:09:15,390 --> 01:09:15,711
You know,

2657
01:09:15,711 --> 01:09:19,700
one of them was just social pressure or
social responsibility and the other one

2658
01:09:19,701 --> 01:09:20,301
being like,

2659
01:09:20,301 --> 01:09:20,471
look,

2660
01:09:20,471 --> 01:09:23,930
you're a real legitimate threat
where Sony's hiring arm guards.

2661
01:09:23,950 --> 01:09:24,410
Yeah.

2662
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:26,630
And it seems like he
freaked out about that less.

2663
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:27,440
Yeah.

2664
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:28,190
It's his,

2665
01:09:28,190 --> 01:09:28,521
it was,

2666
01:09:28,521 --> 01:09:31,550
for him it was more morals and
values and like representing,

2667
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:33,680
he used to be like an
Asian studies professor.

2668
01:09:34,130 --> 01:09:34,611
Really?

2669
01:09:34,611 --> 01:09:34,911
Yeah.

2670
01:09:34,911 --> 01:09:35,451
There's kids.

2671
01:09:35,451 --> 01:09:37,730
Like I'll put up a photo of him
on Instagram and they're like,

2672
01:09:37,731 --> 01:09:37,911
Yo,

2673
01:09:37,911 --> 01:09:38,240
that's,

2674
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:39,650
that's Randall Park.

2675
01:09:39,651 --> 01:09:43,130
He was my professor or my
graduate assistant or whatever.

2676
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:44,090
Wow.

2677
01:09:44,150 --> 01:09:45,440
That's hilarious.

2678
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:46,041
Well,

2679
01:09:46,041 --> 01:09:47,570
he seems like a very educated,

2680
01:09:47,690 --> 01:09:49,430
measured sort of a dude.

2681
01:09:50,180 --> 01:09:51,013
Real smart.

2682
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:52,400
That's a wild,

2683
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:53,271
wild thing,

2684
01:09:53,271 --> 01:09:53,511
man.

2685
01:09:53,511 --> 01:09:56,990
To be a part of like one of the most
controversial movies and all of history.

2686
01:09:57,370 --> 01:09:57,621
I mean,

2687
01:09:57,621 --> 01:09:59,270
if you think about like Hollywood movies,

2688
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:00,620
probably the most controversial,

2689
01:10:00,621 --> 01:10:02,060
it's right up there with
passion of the Christ.

2690
01:10:02,061 --> 01:10:03,290
Do you remember passion of the Christ?

2691
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:05,750
That while there was that
one and there was the other,

2692
01:10:05,870 --> 01:10:06,770
the other one,

2693
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:07,580
um,

2694
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:10,400
before passion of the
Christ Willem Defoe played,

2695
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:15,760
he played Jesus in a much
more controversial film
a long fucking time ago.

2696
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:17,533
I don't remember that one.

2697
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:20,270
Do you know what I'm talking about?

2698
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:20,451
Yeah.

2699
01:10:20,451 --> 01:10:21,410
I don't remember the name of it,

2700
01:10:21,411 --> 01:10:25,550
but people were mad as fuck because I
think he had like a sexual relationship

2701
01:10:25,551 --> 01:10:28,460
with Mary and the movie or something
like that and people last temptation of

2702
01:10:28,461 --> 01:10:28,970
Christ.

2703
01:10:28,970 --> 01:10:29,810
Oh yeah,

2704
01:10:29,811 --> 01:10:30,381
yeah.

2705
01:10:30,381 --> 01:10:32,540
People thought it was
blast from this and the,

2706
01:10:32,570 --> 01:10:33,440
but it's still,

2707
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,300
the thing about Christians is,

2708
01:10:35,301 --> 01:10:35,661
man,

2709
01:10:35,661 --> 01:10:38,480
you could piss them off and they'll
fucking angry and you get a few death

2710
01:10:38,481 --> 01:10:38,811
threats,

2711
01:10:38,811 --> 01:10:39,170
but very,

2712
01:10:39,170 --> 01:10:39,830
you know,

2713
01:10:39,830 --> 01:10:44,270
it's not like someone drawing Muhammad
like this Charlie Hebdo thing.

2714
01:10:44,290 --> 01:10:49,290
Like that's the most fucked up of all
the religions to to pick on pick on the

2715
01:10:50,271 --> 01:10:51,980
Muslims and they do dark shit.

2716
01:10:52,010 --> 01:10:53,270
You start to see a pattern though,

2717
01:10:53,271 --> 01:10:53,630
right?

2718
01:10:53,630 --> 01:10:55,460
It's like people,

2719
01:10:55,461 --> 01:10:57,050
whether it's France or America,

2720
01:10:57,080 --> 01:11:02,080
people in like a position of
power feel like they're entitled,

2721
01:11:02,450 --> 01:11:02,780
right?

2722
01:11:02,780 --> 01:11:04,040
We talked about entitlement.

2723
01:11:04,041 --> 01:11:04,880
They feel entitled,

2724
01:11:04,881 --> 01:11:09,200
like I have to be able to make fun of
everybody and it's sometimes it's just is

2725
01:11:09,201 --> 01:11:10,034
it worth it?

2726
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:10,760
Well,

2727
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:12,770
they think that you got
to change the culture.

2728
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:17,070
That what I think a lot of people think
that it's almost a responsibility to

2729
01:11:17,071 --> 01:11:20,190
take those risks because
at the end of the day,

2730
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:25,460
anybody that is angry to the point where
they want to kill someone for satire is

2731
01:11:26,041 --> 01:11:29,880
in the wrong and you have to protect
it is you have to protect free speech.

2732
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:31,320
And the only way to protect free speech,

2733
01:11:31,321 --> 01:11:36,240
like Sam Harris felt that everyone
should have like unilaterally across the

2734
01:11:36,241 --> 01:11:36,541
board,

2735
01:11:36,541 --> 01:11:37,710
like every magazine,

2736
01:11:37,711 --> 01:11:39,390
every newspaper should
have published all those,

2737
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:40,553
those images.

2738
01:11:40,710 --> 01:11:42,840
That's the only way they could
ever protect free speech.

2739
01:11:43,410 --> 01:11:44,250
How do you feel?

2740
01:11:44,910 --> 01:11:45,390
Well,

2741
01:11:45,390 --> 01:11:47,010
I'm not a publisher so I don't,

2742
01:11:47,020 --> 01:11:48,240
I see Sam's point,

2743
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:50,760
but I also see the point of people that
don't want to publish it because they

2744
01:11:50,761 --> 01:11:54,210
don't want to risk their lives for
something that they feel like is a story

2745
01:11:54,211 --> 01:11:55,050
they're reporting on.

2746
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:58,500
They don't feel like it's
their responsibility because
they didn't create those

2747
01:11:58,501 --> 01:11:59,334
cartoons,

2748
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:01,920
but they feel like this is a
story they're reporting on.

2749
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:04,800
They can report on that story
without putting them in danger.

2750
01:12:05,850 --> 01:12:10,320
This is not like the first time someone's
been killed for making a drawing about

2751
01:12:10,321 --> 01:12:10,771
Muhammad.

2752
01:12:10,771 --> 01:12:11,700
I mean there's like,

2753
01:12:11,730 --> 01:12:15,030
there was some credible threats against
the south park guys after they did

2754
01:12:15,031 --> 01:12:15,331
those,

2755
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:15,600
uh,

2756
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:20,600
episodes of South Park where they had
Muhammad in like a guy like was in a teddy

2757
01:12:22,501 --> 01:12:24,660
bear outfit and then they
put them inside a truck.

2758
01:12:24,661 --> 01:12:28,980
He was talking from inside a truck and
they still were getting like credible

2759
01:12:28,981 --> 01:12:29,610
threats.

2760
01:12:29,610 --> 01:12:30,990
Like people are saying that
we're going to kill him.

2761
01:12:31,050 --> 01:12:36,050
I absolutely believe in
everybody's freedom of speech
to say whatever it is you

2762
01:12:36,271 --> 01:12:37,104
want to say.

2763
01:12:37,110 --> 01:12:38,550
Like you have to have that right.

2764
01:12:38,610 --> 01:12:42,450
But you'll also have to know
there's going to be repercussions.

2765
01:12:42,450 --> 01:12:45,390
You can't expect and you
have to calculate it.

2766
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:46,560
Right?

2767
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:47,393
Cause it's also,

2768
01:12:48,150 --> 01:12:49,170
do you have to like,

2769
01:12:49,171 --> 01:12:50,580
did we have to make the interview?

2770
01:12:51,540 --> 01:12:52,950
Did that movie half to get made?

2771
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:53,791
I didn't see it.

2772
01:12:53,791 --> 01:12:57,120
So I can't say if I saw it and it
was as funny as like team America,

2773
01:12:57,180 --> 01:12:57,580
I would say.

2774
01:12:57,580 --> 01:12:58,413
Yeah,

2775
01:12:58,440 --> 01:12:59,490
I love team America.

2776
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:00,000
You know,

2777
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,030
I don't even think North
Korea's mad about team man.

2778
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:04,500
So I fucking love team America.

2779
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:06,150
But that's why the South Park dudes,

2780
01:13:06,151 --> 01:13:09,060
I loved them because they have a purpose
and there's something they're really

2781
01:13:09,061 --> 01:13:12,720
saying and it's like
everybody can be in on it.

2782
01:13:12,990 --> 01:13:13,800
In a way.

2783
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:15,930
The interview is not nuance like that.

2784
01:13:15,931 --> 01:13:18,630
Randall does a really good job for,

2785
01:13:18,631 --> 01:13:22,140
I'd say two thirds of the
movie humanizing Kim Jong On.

2786
01:13:22,530 --> 01:13:25,410
But then of course like the writing
takes a dive and it just is like,

2787
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:25,771
okay,

2788
01:13:25,771 --> 01:13:28,710
here's everything we expected
to see in this movie.

2789
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:29,580
They had a wrap it up,

2790
01:13:29,581 --> 01:13:31,740
probably wrapped it up Hollywood proper.

2791
01:13:32,130 --> 01:13:33,120
And you know,

2792
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:38,540
it's for people who are in oppressed
countries or an oppressed ideology,

2793
01:13:39,061 --> 01:13:40,890
it's why continue to poke them.

2794
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:42,031
You know,

2795
01:13:42,031 --> 01:13:43,320
they're gonna respond badly.

2796
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:45,870
You kind of have a responsibility to like,

2797
01:13:45,930 --> 01:13:48,900
people just don't fucking poke that dog.

2798
01:13:49,350 --> 01:13:50,640
And if you're going to poke that dog,

2799
01:13:50,670 --> 01:13:52,890
you got to have a real solid,

2800
01:13:52,891 --> 01:13:55,110
legitimate point to what you're doing.

2801
01:13:56,060 --> 01:13:56,470
Yeah.

2802
01:13:56,470 --> 01:14:00,030
There has to be a positive social
benefit to like what's going on here.

2803
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:05,060
It's not just to like create a stunt to
flex the muscle of freedom of speech.

2804
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:06,121
Yeah.

2805
01:14:06,121 --> 01:14:09,990
There's like deep responsibilities that
you have when you taco any like Railey

2806
01:14:09,991 --> 01:14:11,160
super controversial.

2807
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:13,600
This is some deep responsibilities.

2808
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:14,320
Yeah.

2809
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:16,300
And that's one of one of the deepest,

2810
01:14:16,301 --> 01:14:16,660
right?

2811
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:16,871
Yeah.

2812
01:14:16,871 --> 01:14:17,740
Just even me and you,

2813
01:14:17,741 --> 01:14:20,590
I probably have the legal right to
say whatever the fuck I want to say,

2814
01:14:20,591 --> 01:14:20,981
but like,

2815
01:14:20,981 --> 01:14:22,180
why would I say that to you?

2816
01:14:22,270 --> 01:14:22,931
I respect you.

2817
01:14:22,931 --> 01:14:23,764
Do you know what I mean?

2818
01:14:24,510 --> 01:14:24,790
You know,

2819
01:14:24,790 --> 01:14:26,290
we do it in our daily lives,

2820
01:14:26,730 --> 01:14:27,040
you know?

2821
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:27,400
I mean,

2822
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:28,600
I can see if they,

2823
01:14:28,740 --> 01:14:29,573
I don't know,

2824
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:31,480
the Charlie Hebdo thing.

2825
01:14:31,481 --> 01:14:32,720
It's strange because what,

2826
01:14:32,721 --> 01:14:35,200
what it was really
fascinating to me was not,

2827
01:14:35,830 --> 01:14:37,300
not necessarily,

2828
01:14:37,301 --> 01:14:39,550
I mean it was horrible what had happened.

2829
01:14:39,870 --> 01:14:42,250
It wasn't necessarily surprising,

2830
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:47,710
but what was surprising to me was
like super progressive people who were

2831
01:14:47,711 --> 01:14:49,210
criticizing the,

2832
01:14:49,211 --> 01:14:54,211
the magazine saying that this is in
response for racist cartoons and they were

2833
01:14:54,911 --> 01:14:58,600
almost justifying it in the way they
were saying they weren't justifying it,

2834
01:14:58,601 --> 01:15:03,340
but by focusing on what they felt
was racist cartoons instead of like,

2835
01:15:03,341 --> 01:15:03,470
Hey,

2836
01:15:03,470 --> 01:15:04,360
well so what,

2837
01:15:04,630 --> 01:15:09,630
you don't assassins stormed a magazine
and shot people and you would get a

2838
01:15:10,070 --> 01:15:11,020
grocery store.

2839
01:15:11,050 --> 01:15:11,411
Yeah.

2840
01:15:11,411 --> 01:15:14,830
You guys are looking for Social Brownie
points by trying to be like the most

2841
01:15:14,831 --> 01:15:16,270
progressive sensitive,

2842
01:15:16,271 --> 01:15:17,920
non racist people alive.

2843
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:18,753
Like it's like it's,

2844
01:15:18,870 --> 01:15:19,220
it's,

2845
01:15:19,220 --> 01:15:20,560
there's only one response.

2846
01:15:20,561 --> 01:15:24,580
The response is you should never
kill someone for drawing something.

2847
01:15:24,610 --> 01:15:25,443
Absolutely.

2848
01:15:25,690 --> 01:15:26,523
Absolutely.

2849
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:27,693
My,

2850
01:15:28,150 --> 01:15:28,361
you know,

2851
01:15:28,361 --> 01:15:29,470
I think what the articles is,

2852
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:30,580
I fully agree with you.

2853
01:15:30,610 --> 01:15:31,270
There's,

2854
01:15:31,270 --> 01:15:35,980
there's no justification for any
of this radical fucking stuff.

2855
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:36,890
Do you know what I mean?

2856
01:15:36,890 --> 01:15:37,723
Like,

2857
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:39,010
you know,

2858
01:15:39,010 --> 01:15:40,930
I don't even connect it to Islam.

2859
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:44,010
I think it's a cover and it
has nothing to do with Islam.

2860
01:15:44,060 --> 01:15:44,431
It is.

2861
01:15:44,431 --> 01:15:47,320
These are just people
on their own doing wild,

2862
01:15:47,860 --> 01:15:48,693
crazy,

2863
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:49,960
aborad behavior.

2864
01:15:50,470 --> 01:15:51,161
My thing is,

2865
01:15:51,161 --> 01:15:53,470
is as the rational
people in the situation,

2866
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:57,310
as irrational people in a relationship
to these radical movements,

2867
01:15:57,340 --> 01:15:59,260
it's just why inside it,

2868
01:15:59,410 --> 01:16:00,460
it's not worth it.

2869
01:16:00,820 --> 01:16:01,270
You know,

2870
01:16:01,270 --> 01:16:02,650
like we have to be better.

2871
01:16:02,980 --> 01:16:03,191
Right?

2872
01:16:03,191 --> 01:16:04,120
But when does it end?

2873
01:16:04,180 --> 01:16:04,391
I mean,

2874
01:16:04,391 --> 01:16:06,130
how do you stop that sort of behavior?

2875
01:16:06,131 --> 01:16:07,990
Do you kill everybody
who thinks like that?

2876
01:16:08,290 --> 01:16:08,741
What do you do?

2877
01:16:08,741 --> 01:16:08,951
I mean,

2878
01:16:08,951 --> 01:16:09,330
how do you,

2879
01:16:09,330 --> 01:16:14,050
when joining Isis and people keep
joining al Qaeda and you know,

2880
01:16:14,051 --> 01:16:17,770
there's a lot of those vice I think did
something called like children of the

2881
01:16:17,771 --> 01:16:22,540
drones and talked about how I think me,

2882
01:16:22,570 --> 01:16:24,460
me and Shane Talk to you about
it last time we were here,

2883
01:16:24,610 --> 01:16:25,180
but it's,

2884
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:26,013
it's,

2885
01:16:26,050 --> 01:16:26,590
you know,

2886
01:16:26,590 --> 01:16:28,810
people whose families have
been killed by drones,

2887
01:16:28,930 --> 01:16:29,763
they'll sign up.

2888
01:16:30,070 --> 01:16:30,490
Of course,

2889
01:16:30,490 --> 01:16:31,151
they'll go do that.

2890
01:16:31,151 --> 01:16:32,020
And you would do,

2891
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:33,880
and I would too,

2892
01:16:33,940 --> 01:16:35,770
if you were in that land and your,

2893
01:16:35,771 --> 01:16:36,130
your,

2894
01:16:36,130 --> 01:16:40,510
your family got killed by some fucking
robot shooting missiles out of the sky.

2895
01:16:40,511 --> 01:16:41,710
And they killed the wrong people,

2896
01:16:41,711 --> 01:16:44,710
which happens more often than not.

2897
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:45,633
Yeah.

2898
01:16:46,330 --> 01:16:49,480
They're way more unsuccessful
than they are successful.

2899
01:16:49,490 --> 01:16:50,590
And they think about it this way,

2900
01:16:50,591 --> 01:16:50,880
Joe,

2901
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:53,920
like their lives just don't
count like our lives matter.

2902
01:16:54,490 --> 01:16:54,820
You know,

2903
01:16:54,820 --> 01:16:56,050
like this happened in Paris.

2904
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:56,750
It was terrible.

2905
01:16:56,750 --> 01:16:58,060
This terrible tragedy.

2906
01:16:58,061 --> 01:17:00,190
There's no justification for any of this.

2907
01:17:00,580 --> 01:17:01,270
But then it's,

2908
01:17:01,270 --> 01:17:01,750
you know,

2909
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:03,670
what's going on with Boko Haram.

2910
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:06,130
Those lives aren't worth as
much as the ones in Paris,

2911
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:09,130
at least in the eyes of
the press and in the eyes,

2912
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:13,610
the aid and because of Somalis
that were killed and their black.

2913
01:17:14,330 --> 01:17:14,900
Yeah.

2914
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:15,261
I mean,

2915
01:17:15,261 --> 01:17:15,610
I think,

2916
01:17:15,610 --> 01:17:15,890
yeah,

2917
01:17:15,890 --> 01:17:16,250
those are,

2918
01:17:16,250 --> 01:17:17,300
those are some of the factors.

2919
01:17:17,301 --> 01:17:18,290
I think there's even more.

2920
01:17:18,291 --> 01:17:19,340
But even with drones,

2921
01:17:19,341 --> 01:17:22,100
it's like we accept that
innocent people get killed.

2922
01:17:22,130 --> 01:17:23,780
If this was in America,

2923
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:24,531
I mean,

2924
01:17:24,531 --> 01:17:26,700
we wouldn't accept this is it?

2925
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:27,320
It's cops.

2926
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:28,790
Imagine if cops were using drones,

2927
01:17:28,791 --> 01:17:29,990
we wouldn't fucking accept that.

2928
01:17:30,470 --> 01:17:31,303
Yeah.

2929
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:34,700
It's Nigeria actually.

2930
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:35,680
Yeah,

2931
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:36,513
I was wrong.

2932
01:17:36,710 --> 01:17:37,251
But the,

2933
01:17:37,251 --> 01:17:37,670
uh,

2934
01:17:37,670 --> 01:17:38,361
I dunno man.

2935
01:17:38,361 --> 01:17:40,100
This is the world today,

2936
01:17:40,101 --> 01:17:41,290
the climate of the world today.

2937
01:17:41,450 --> 01:17:42,440
It's so disturbing.

2938
01:17:42,650 --> 01:17:47,650
It's so disturbing that we would think
it's okay to engage in a practice where

2939
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:52,910
the great majority of the people that
get killed by that practice or innocence,

2940
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:54,170
which is what drones are.

2941
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:54,950
Yeah.

2942
01:17:54,950 --> 01:17:56,660
And also the thing for me is just like,

2943
01:17:56,810 --> 01:17:57,860
I definitely,

2944
01:17:58,730 --> 01:18:03,560
I definitely fully agree with you that
there is never a reason to kill anyone

2945
01:18:03,590 --> 01:18:06,530
over a satirical article picture,

2946
01:18:06,531 --> 01:18:07,364
whatever.

2947
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:11,060
But the fact of the matter is it's like
do we want to save lives or do we want

2948
01:18:11,061 --> 01:18:12,680
to make a statement about free speech?

2949
01:18:12,950 --> 01:18:13,460
Yeah.

2950
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:14,960
I think it's about saving lives.

2951
01:18:14,961 --> 01:18:18,740
I think it's about doing the right thing
and saying these people feel oppressed.

2952
01:18:18,770 --> 01:18:19,603
We've killed,

2953
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:20,480
you know,

2954
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:22,070
who knows why they're joining Isis,

2955
01:18:22,071 --> 01:18:23,840
who knows why they're joining al Qaeda,

2956
01:18:24,260 --> 01:18:28,820
but we need to go the extra mile
and figure out why they're mad,

2957
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:34,360
address these things and not just like
sit on our high horse because they're mad

2958
01:18:35,150 --> 01:18:38,000
and they probably have some reason for it.

2959
01:18:38,030 --> 01:18:39,440
And whether it's rational or not,

2960
01:18:39,441 --> 01:18:42,080
let's diffuse it instead of inciting it.

2961
01:18:42,110 --> 01:18:42,291
Like,

2962
01:18:42,291 --> 01:18:44,840
that's my opinion is that we're not wrong.

2963
01:18:44,870 --> 01:18:46,550
But like let's solve the problem.

2964
01:18:46,940 --> 01:18:50,570
And the problem is once you
have someone whose child,

2965
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:53,600
who's the child of someone
who was killed by drones,

2966
01:18:53,601 --> 01:18:56,030
or your children were killed
by drones and you become,

2967
01:18:56,270 --> 01:18:56,631
you know,

2968
01:18:56,631 --> 01:18:57,261
this sort of,

2969
01:18:57,261 --> 01:18:57,500
uh,

2970
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:59,330
a radical fundamentalist,

2971
01:18:59,910 --> 01:19:00,530
it's,

2972
01:19:00,530 --> 01:19:02,140
you can't turn that around.

2973
01:19:02,141 --> 01:19:02,870
Like how you,

2974
01:19:02,870 --> 01:19:05,670
there's no eye for an eye
there and it's just like they,

2975
01:19:06,190 --> 01:19:09,500
you've created something that almost
has to go through generations and

2976
01:19:09,501 --> 01:19:11,350
generations in order to calm down and,

2977
01:19:11,390 --> 01:19:14,420
and there's no way to have
any sort of immediate fix.

2978
01:19:14,421 --> 01:19:16,070
And everybody wants an immediate fix.

2979
01:19:16,071 --> 01:19:16,970
You want an immediate fix?

2980
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:17,390
No,

2981
01:19:17,390 --> 01:19:17,631
man,

2982
01:19:17,631 --> 01:19:19,720
this is going to take a hundreds of years.

2983
01:19:19,721 --> 01:19:24,721
And imagine even if you weren't killed
by drones or you're just a kid in Iraq or

2984
01:19:24,831 --> 01:19:28,100
Afghanistan and you've seen your entire
neighborhood blown up and you're born

2985
01:19:28,101 --> 01:19:28,731
into this life,

2986
01:19:28,731 --> 01:19:29,810
you have no choice.

2987
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:30,980
You have nowhere to go,

2988
01:19:30,981 --> 01:19:32,090
you have no opportunity,

2989
01:19:32,091 --> 01:19:32,960
there's no hope.

2990
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:36,110
And then the one thing
you have is religion.

2991
01:19:36,710 --> 01:19:37,041
This,

2992
01:19:37,041 --> 01:19:39,500
these people writing these
cartoons making funny you like,

2993
01:19:39,501 --> 01:19:40,520
what else do you have?

2994
01:19:40,770 --> 01:19:41,270
You know,

2995
01:19:41,270 --> 01:19:43,640
we're really kicking people who are,

2996
01:19:43,641 --> 01:19:44,480
who have nothing.

2997
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:46,550
And when you poke people who have nothing,

2998
01:19:47,510 --> 01:19:48,410
not in a,

2999
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:49,670
it's not reasonable,

3000
01:19:49,671 --> 01:19:50,960
but bad things are gonna happen.

3001
01:19:51,110 --> 01:19:56,110
And that's what fuels the sort of crazy
conspiracy theories about the military

3002
01:19:56,121 --> 01:19:59,810
industrial complex being the
sort of perpetual war machine,

3003
01:20:00,050 --> 01:20:02,660
like create enemies like that.

3004
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:03,970
That's the way to create enemies,

3005
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:05,300
destroy areas,

3006
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:05,960
uh,

3007
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:08,010
kill a million innocent people

3008
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:08,521
in Iraq.

3009
01:20:08,521 --> 01:20:08,931
That's the,

3010
01:20:08,931 --> 01:20:09,960
the number that I've heard.

3011
01:20:10,260 --> 01:20:10,531
I mean,

3012
01:20:10,531 --> 01:20:11,530
I don't know what the did,

3013
01:20:11,650 --> 01:20:15,750
somewhere between several hundred thousand
and a million innocent people have

3014
01:20:15,751 --> 01:20:18,990
died as a direct result
of our actions in Iraq.

3015
01:20:19,130 --> 01:20:20,820
We just as a number alone man,

3016
01:20:21,090 --> 01:20:25,140
that's almost ensuring there's going
to be some sort of a fucking military

3017
01:20:25,141 --> 01:20:27,480
conflict over there for a long time.

3018
01:20:27,481 --> 01:20:31,740
And the people that are alive today that
are involved in selling arms and the

3019
01:20:31,741 --> 01:20:32,940
military industrial complex,

3020
01:20:33,150 --> 01:20:36,420
they're going to profit off of
that action for a long time.

3021
01:20:36,450 --> 01:20:37,830
And what do we have against these people?

3022
01:20:37,831 --> 01:20:39,000
You don't have anything against them.

3023
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:40,290
Don't have anything against them.

3024
01:20:40,291 --> 01:20:41,124
How could you know?

3025
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:42,810
I were there like no idea.

3026
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:45,810
And we're there for false
pretenses for both places,

3027
01:20:45,811 --> 01:20:47,610
whether it's Afghanistan or Iraq.

3028
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:49,740
The idea behind it was a lie,

3029
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:50,850
especially Iraq.

3030
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:51,810
I mean the idea that,

3031
01:20:52,110 --> 01:20:52,943
you know,

3032
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:54,270
the one thing is like,

3033
01:20:54,271 --> 01:20:54,541
hey,

3034
01:20:54,541 --> 01:20:54,751
you know,

3035
01:20:54,751 --> 01:20:55,830
we got rid of a dictator.

3036
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:56,341
Yeah,

3037
01:20:56,341 --> 01:20:56,971
we definitely did.

3038
01:20:56,971 --> 01:20:57,750
He's a piece of shit,

3039
01:20:57,750 --> 01:20:58,650
no doubt about it.

3040
01:20:58,651 --> 01:20:59,461
But as a piece of shit,

3041
01:20:59,461 --> 01:21:00,294
we propped up,

3042
01:21:00,510 --> 01:21:02,130
we put them into place in the first place.

3043
01:21:02,131 --> 01:21:04,680
We helped him out and now what's better?

3044
01:21:04,710 --> 01:21:05,221
What's better?

3045
01:21:05,221 --> 01:21:06,810
Is that better than Isis?

3046
01:21:07,060 --> 01:21:07,291
I mean,

3047
01:21:07,291 --> 01:21:08,490
we divided that country.

3048
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:09,030
Yeah.

3049
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:09,271
You know,

3050
01:21:09,271 --> 01:21:12,330
we divided that country
and then Palestine,

3051
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:14,160
all the countries had
something to do with that.

3052
01:21:14,250 --> 01:21:14,900
And,

3053
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:16,800
and then we look at Iraq and people,

3054
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:18,090
even the cynical ones are like,

3055
01:21:18,091 --> 01:21:19,080
we're there for oil.

3056
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:22,800
But look at oil prices now
with fracking and natural gas.

3057
01:21:22,801 --> 01:21:23,840
Now the oil price has dropped.

3058
01:21:23,841 --> 01:21:24,080
And like,

3059
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:27,540
so now why are we still fighting
people while still money?

3060
01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:27,990
You know?

3061
01:21:27,990 --> 01:21:30,210
Even though this not as much money,

3062
01:21:30,211 --> 01:21:32,370
there's still a shitload of oil.

3063
01:21:32,390 --> 01:21:32,760
Yeah.

3064
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:33,840
Like I'm against fracking.

3065
01:21:33,841 --> 01:21:35,490
But if it can create Middle East peace,

3066
01:21:35,491 --> 01:21:36,630
like maybe I'm for fracking,

3067
01:21:36,870 --> 01:21:37,320
you know what I mean?

3068
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:38,670
Like I'm definitely against fracking,

3069
01:21:38,671 --> 01:21:40,920
but it's just like we
can't win with anything.

3070
01:21:40,921 --> 01:21:41,600
Then he,

3071
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:42,360
yeah.

3072
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:42,721
That's,

3073
01:21:42,721 --> 01:21:43,020
uh,

3074
01:21:43,020 --> 01:21:43,853
people are gross.

3075
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:45,313
Yeah.

3076
01:21:46,380 --> 01:21:46,860
And you know,

3077
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:47,520
anyways,

3078
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:47,761
yeah.

3079
01:21:47,761 --> 01:21:47,911
And,

3080
01:21:47,911 --> 01:21:48,231
and the,

3081
01:21:48,231 --> 01:21:52,260
they say the world temperature was the
hottest year ever on records and they

3082
01:21:52,261 --> 01:21:53,070
kept,

3083
01:21:53,070 --> 01:21:55,020
and they said that by 2025,

3084
01:21:55,290 --> 01:21:56,550
it's going to greenhouse gases.

3085
01:21:56,551 --> 01:21:59,040
The temperature of the earth
will be irreversible and like,

3086
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:01,830
who knows if that's true,

3087
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:03,120
but I mean,

3088
01:22:03,121 --> 01:22:05,160
I feel like we should just
start to work on an owl,

3089
01:22:05,250 --> 01:22:05,640
you know.

3090
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:05,950
Well,

3091
01:22:05,950 --> 01:22:06,220
do,

3092
01:22:06,220 --> 01:22:07,680
they could start to work on it now,

3093
01:22:07,681 --> 01:22:10,590
but I think the real issue
is once this cycle has been,

3094
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:12,100
it has begun.

3095
01:22:12,150 --> 01:22:14,100
It's almost impossible turnaround.

3096
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:15,570
It's kind of got to play out.

3097
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:16,831
I had this guy,

3098
01:22:16,831 --> 01:22:20,700
Randall Carlson on my podcast and
he's going to be on again soon,

3099
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:21,271
um,

3100
01:22:21,271 --> 01:22:25,800
and pull that shit up February 2nd.

3101
01:22:26,340 --> 01:22:27,300
He'll be back again.

3102
01:22:27,540 --> 01:22:32,460
And he's a fascinating guy and he's
an expert on cataclysmic events and,

3103
01:22:32,490 --> 01:22:33,323
um,

3104
01:22:33,410 --> 01:22:33,661
and,

3105
01:22:33,661 --> 01:22:35,490
and global warming,

3106
01:22:35,491 --> 01:22:39,390
he said is far preferable
to global cooling.

3107
01:22:39,780 --> 01:22:42,030
He's like everybody that's
worried about global warming,

3108
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:45,350
all the great periods in
history as far as advancement,

3109
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:48,540
as far as like a innovation civilization.

3110
01:22:48,541 --> 01:22:49,950
They all have followed,

3111
01:22:49,951 --> 01:22:51,240
grow global warming,

3112
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:53,290
global cooling on the other hand.

3113
01:22:53,291 --> 01:22:57,120
And these were all natural cycles
before we started inventing machines and

3114
01:22:57,121 --> 01:22:58,380
carbon emissions and all that shit.

3115
01:22:58,710 --> 01:22:59,940
But the global cooling,

3116
01:22:59,941 --> 01:23:00,330
he said,

3117
01:23:00,330 --> 01:23:00,591
I,

3118
01:23:00,591 --> 01:23:02,070
sage is terrible.

3119
01:23:02,340 --> 01:23:02,551
Yeah.

3120
01:23:02,551 --> 01:23:02,821
I mean,

3121
01:23:02,821 --> 01:23:04,200
we could debate this forever,

3122
01:23:04,201 --> 01:23:04,891
but the thing is,

3123
01:23:04,891 --> 01:23:07,420
is this is an artificial warming.

3124
01:23:08,020 --> 01:23:08,351
Well,

3125
01:23:08,351 --> 01:23:10,180
it's artificially accelerated.

3126
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:11,740
The cycle has always been,

3127
01:23:11,770 --> 01:23:15,610
there's a natural cycle that you could
track that's always existed of warming

3128
01:23:15,611 --> 01:23:17,470
and cooling and uncontrollable,

3129
01:23:17,471 --> 01:23:19,810
like the ice age that
wasn't caused by man,

3130
01:23:20,140 --> 01:23:20,470
you know,

3131
01:23:20,470 --> 01:23:21,340
and the ice age.

3132
01:23:21,341 --> 01:23:23,620
The ending of the ice age
also wasn't caused by man.

3133
01:23:23,620 --> 01:23:27,430
They believe it was caused by Asteroidal
impacts around 12,000 years ago.

3134
01:23:27,670 --> 01:23:30,340
But this is something that
Randall's an expert in.

3135
01:23:30,341 --> 01:23:30,521
I mean,

3136
01:23:30,521 --> 01:23:30,770
he had,

3137
01:23:30,770 --> 01:23:33,250
he had these charts and graphs
and showed us all these,

3138
01:23:33,251 --> 01:23:33,551
uh,

3139
01:23:33,551 --> 01:23:38,551
these photographic pieces of evidence
of global warming's a good thing.

3140
01:23:39,610 --> 01:23:40,120
He doesn't,

3141
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:40,340
well,

3142
01:23:40,340 --> 01:23:40,781
he,

3143
01:23:40,781 --> 01:23:41,260
you know,

3144
01:23:41,260 --> 01:23:41,921
everyone's like,

3145
01:23:41,921 --> 01:23:42,820
the debate is settled.

3146
01:23:42,821 --> 01:23:43,151
He's like,

3147
01:23:43,151 --> 01:23:44,790
the debate hasn't even begun.

3148
01:23:44,890 --> 01:23:45,910
Like it hasn't even been gone,

3149
01:23:45,911 --> 01:23:46,810
but he's saying this,

3150
01:23:46,811 --> 01:23:48,130
this is not,

3151
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:48,431
it's,

3152
01:23:48,431 --> 01:23:48,641
look,

3153
01:23:48,641 --> 01:23:49,720
it's definitely not good.

3154
01:23:49,721 --> 01:23:52,810
Pollutants aren't good particulates or
what he's really worried about more than

3155
01:23:52,811 --> 01:23:53,644
the warming.

3156
01:23:53,650 --> 01:23:56,200
He's worried about what we're doing
to the air and places where they're,

3157
01:23:56,230 --> 01:23:57,320
they're burning coal.

3158
01:23:57,321 --> 01:24:00,790
Like if you look at China and these
cities that are almost unoccupied bubble

3159
01:24:00,791 --> 01:24:01,480
like you,

3160
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:01,780
you,

3161
01:24:01,780 --> 01:24:02,650
people can't live there.

3162
01:24:02,651 --> 01:24:05,170
They're walking around with the
fucking masks on their face everywhere.

3163
01:24:05,171 --> 01:24:07,450
The Sky is perpetually dark gray.

3164
01:24:07,900 --> 01:24:08,350
He said,

3165
01:24:08,350 --> 01:24:09,870
that's particulates.

3166
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:10,150
He said,

3167
01:24:10,150 --> 01:24:11,140
that's what we should really,

3168
01:24:11,141 --> 01:24:12,730
really be concerned with pollutants,

3169
01:24:12,850 --> 01:24:13,990
what we're doing to the ocean.

3170
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:14,980
But he's like,

3171
01:24:14,980 --> 01:24:17,350
global warming is a bad thing,

3172
01:24:17,351 --> 01:24:20,110
but it's not nearly as
bad as the alternative.

3173
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:20,411
He says.

3174
01:24:20,411 --> 01:24:20,861
Interesting.

3175
01:24:20,861 --> 01:24:22,690
Global Cooling is terrifying.

3176
01:24:23,150 --> 01:24:24,020
I got to listen to that one.

3177
01:24:24,180 --> 01:24:24,420
Ooh.

3178
01:24:24,420 --> 01:24:25,720
He scared the fuck out of me.

3179
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:26,913
Yeah.

3180
01:24:27,970 --> 01:24:28,141
Well,

3181
01:24:28,141 --> 01:24:32,140
he also scared the fuck on me because
he was explaining all the verifiable

3182
01:24:32,740 --> 01:24:35,260
instances of asteroidal
impacts throughout history,

3183
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:39,550
verifiable where they've asteroids
have hit or comments of hit,

3184
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:44,020
things have hit the earth and just fucked
everything sideways and this is what

3185
01:24:44,021 --> 01:24:44,440
they teach.

3186
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:48,310
They tie this into these ancient
structures that are totally unexplained.

3187
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:53,020
Like there's some ancient structures from
pre 10,000 years ago that they didn't

3188
01:24:53,021 --> 01:24:55,030
even know people could
build these kinds of things.

3189
01:24:55,031 --> 01:24:58,840
Back then they thought the 10,000 years
ago was like people were hunters and

3190
01:24:58,841 --> 01:24:59,350
gatherers.

3191
01:24:59,350 --> 01:25:01,390
So they've tried to explain
a lot of these structures,

3192
01:25:01,391 --> 01:25:02,920
especially cause they're
made out of stone.

3193
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:05,050
They've tried to explain
them by saying no,

3194
01:25:05,051 --> 01:25:05,884
they were built,

3195
01:25:05,890 --> 01:25:06,251
you know,

3196
01:25:06,251 --> 01:25:07,730
much sooner by you know,

3197
01:25:07,750 --> 01:25:10,000
modern people and they just
forgot how they built them.

3198
01:25:10,230 --> 01:25:12,190
And they were built like 2000
years ago or something like that.

3199
01:25:12,490 --> 01:25:13,000
But they have,

3200
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:13,360
there's,

3201
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:18,360
since they've discovered some structures
that they have verified that are twelve

3202
01:25:18,610 --> 01:25:19,121
thousand fourteen thousand years old,

3203
01:25:19,121 --> 01:25:23,380
like there's some stuff in Turkey that
they found this place called Gold Beckley

3204
01:25:23,380 --> 01:25:23,560
Tempe.

3205
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:25,750
They found for sure 12,000 years old,

3206
01:25:25,810 --> 01:25:30,400
huge stone columns with three d
reliefs of animals on them and shit.

3207
01:25:30,401 --> 01:25:33,600
All really sophisticated stuff for hunters
and gatherers at the time that we're

3208
01:25:33,601 --> 01:25:36,610
supposed to be wearing animal
skins and thrown pointy sticks.

3209
01:25:36,611 --> 01:25:37,810
It fucking moving creatures,

3210
01:25:37,811 --> 01:25:38,644
you know,

3211
01:25:38,950 --> 01:25:39,301
so the,

3212
01:25:39,301 --> 01:25:42,490
the this Guy Randall
Carlson points to all these,

3213
01:25:42,491 --> 01:25:43,060
um,

3214
01:25:43,060 --> 01:25:47,350
these instances of core samples where
they find the stuff called nuclear glass

3215
01:25:47,590 --> 01:25:52,060
that only exists on nuclear blast
test sites and we're asteroids hit,

3216
01:25:52,260 --> 01:25:55,720
it's all over Europe and
Asia at around 12,000 years.

3217
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:56,770
And the core samples.

3218
01:25:57,250 --> 01:25:57,910
Wow.

3219
01:25:57,910 --> 01:25:58,390
Yeah.

3220
01:25:58,390 --> 01:26:00,400
So it was verifiable evidence.

3221
01:26:00,401 --> 01:26:01,330
And this is not just him.

3222
01:26:01,331 --> 01:26:02,220
There's also these all,

3223
01:26:02,230 --> 01:26:06,710
all these other geologists that have found
these micro diamonds that only exists

3224
01:26:06,711 --> 01:26:09,110
from massive impact craters,

3225
01:26:09,350 --> 01:26:10,460
massive impacts,

3226
01:26:10,461 --> 01:26:11,294
just huge,

3227
01:26:11,540 --> 01:26:12,373
powerful,

3228
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:13,170
you know,

3229
01:26:13,170 --> 01:26:14,003
events.

3230
01:26:14,150 --> 01:26:14,321
And they,

3231
01:26:14,321 --> 01:26:17,660
so they think that somewhere around
12,000 years ago we were just hit,

3232
01:26:18,170 --> 01:26:18,411
you know,

3233
01:26:18,411 --> 01:26:19,191
and that happens.

3234
01:26:19,191 --> 01:26:19,521
He said it,

3235
01:26:19,521 --> 01:26:20,180
it's not,

3236
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:22,580
it's not whether or not
it's going to happen again.

3237
01:26:22,581 --> 01:26:23,960
It's when is it gonna happen again?

3238
01:26:24,230 --> 01:26:25,063
And you never know.

3239
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:28,250
You never know when things come behind
the sun and we can't even see them until

3240
01:26:28,251 --> 01:26:29,900
it's too late because the sun,

3241
01:26:29,901 --> 01:26:32,180
the gravity of his son Ben Space and time,

3242
01:26:32,390 --> 01:26:35,390
because it's so immense that you literally
can't see them when they're headed

3243
01:26:35,391 --> 01:26:36,080
your way.

3244
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:36,711
They're headed your way,

3245
01:26:36,711 --> 01:26:38,810
but we can't view them.

3246
01:26:39,290 --> 01:26:42,890
So there's things that pass near us
that we didn't see until it's like,

3247
01:26:42,891 --> 01:26:43,690
oh Jesus.

3248
01:26:43,690 --> 01:26:44,020
You know,

3249
01:26:44,020 --> 01:26:45,470
it's really too short fat.

3250
01:26:46,250 --> 01:26:47,600
It's really too short.

3251
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:49,460
And even if you don't get
hit by an asteroid like,

3252
01:26:49,461 --> 01:26:49,641
dude,

3253
01:26:49,641 --> 01:26:52,160
I'm 47 I'm halfway dead looking good,

3254
01:26:52,161 --> 01:26:52,410
Joe.

3255
01:26:52,410 --> 01:26:53,243
Thank you very much.

3256
01:26:53,730 --> 01:26:55,300
But there's no getting around that.

3257
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:56,470
Even if you stay looking good,

3258
01:26:56,471 --> 01:26:56,871
what are you gotta look?

3259
01:26:56,871 --> 01:26:56,981
Look,

3260
01:26:56,981 --> 01:26:57,260
look,

3261
01:26:57,260 --> 01:26:58,400
I met Cindy Crawford.

3262
01:26:58,430 --> 01:27:00,100
I think she's like 51
or something like that.

3263
01:27:00,101 --> 01:27:00,651
So bad.

3264
01:27:00,651 --> 01:27:01,484
Still

3265
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:04,490
smoke is still bad.

3266
01:27:04,510 --> 01:27:04,860
Oh,

3267
01:27:04,860 --> 01:27:06,170
well you know some girls,

3268
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:07,610
they hit that ball hard,

3269
01:27:07,611 --> 01:27:10,100
but this bitch has been
preparing for that wall.

3270
01:27:10,610 --> 01:27:13,340
She's got fucking rubber shoes.

3271
01:27:13,341 --> 01:27:14,420
She puts her feet up.

3272
01:27:14,421 --> 01:27:15,560
She's bouncing back.

3273
01:27:15,770 --> 01:27:16,910
I don't know what she's doing,

3274
01:27:16,911 --> 01:27:17,750
but whatever she's doing,

3275
01:27:17,751 --> 01:27:19,400
she should write books and give seminars.

3276
01:27:19,570 --> 01:27:19,730
Yeah.

3277
01:27:19,730 --> 01:27:20,840
She broke through that wall.

3278
01:27:21,110 --> 01:27:21,751
She definitely,

3279
01:27:21,751 --> 01:27:22,491
she's doing something.

3280
01:27:22,491 --> 01:27:23,600
She's beautiful.

3281
01:27:23,601 --> 01:27:23,841
I mean,

3282
01:27:23,841 --> 01:27:26,210
not just beautiful for 50 she's beautiful.

3283
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:27,080
Oh yeah.

3284
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:27,950
So you know,

3285
01:27:28,220 --> 01:27:28,880
but that doesn't matter.

3286
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:29,720
She's going to die too.

3287
01:27:29,780 --> 01:27:30,470
They all die.

3288
01:27:30,470 --> 01:27:31,303
Everybody dies.

3289
01:27:31,310 --> 01:27:35,640
So whether you get hit by an asteroid
or global cooling or global warming or,

3290
01:27:36,140 --> 01:27:41,140
but the reality is civilization
itself might not exist if we get hit.

3291
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:43,610
That's why all the other
shit we're talking about.

3292
01:27:43,611 --> 01:27:44,330
People who are like,

3293
01:27:44,330 --> 01:27:46,220
they treat it like life
and death and it just like,

3294
01:27:46,790 --> 01:27:47,001
like,

3295
01:27:47,001 --> 01:27:47,821
come on man.

3296
01:27:47,821 --> 01:27:48,620
It's perspective.

3297
01:27:48,620 --> 01:27:49,640
Nothing's worth it.

3298
01:27:49,790 --> 01:27:53,000
It's all perspective in his life and
death for them because their life is dog

3299
01:27:53,001 --> 01:27:53,834
shit.

3300
01:27:53,940 --> 01:27:55,670
Know what I'm saying?

3301
01:27:55,671 --> 01:27:56,780
If your life is amazing,

3302
01:27:56,781 --> 01:27:57,680
it's not life and death.

3303
01:27:57,681 --> 01:27:59,840
If somebody draws a cartoon
of your fucking leader.

3304
01:28:00,570 --> 01:28:01,970
But even when I was broke,

3305
01:28:01,971 --> 01:28:02,830
just selling Dune,

3306
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:03,351
whatever,

3307
01:28:03,351 --> 01:28:06,470
like fucking around like life
was still dope is mad font.

3308
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:06,651
Well,

3309
01:28:06,651 --> 01:28:07,461
you're a fun dude.

3310
01:28:07,461 --> 01:28:08,510
You've got a great personality,

3311
01:28:08,511 --> 01:28:09,630
which is why you're,

3312
01:28:09,710 --> 01:28:12,350
you should be some sort of an
entertainer in the first place.

3313
01:28:12,350 --> 01:28:15,050
You know you in Joe Peshy
we may make this happen.

3314
01:28:15,051 --> 01:28:15,771
You want to be the narrow,

3315
01:28:15,771 --> 01:28:16,580
you won't be ace.

3316
01:28:16,580 --> 01:28:17,413
Nah,

3317
01:28:17,450 --> 01:28:18,031
come on.

3318
01:28:18,031 --> 01:28:19,100
So I'm not interested.

3319
01:28:19,490 --> 01:28:20,890
You don't want to run the Tan Jews.

3320
01:28:21,140 --> 01:28:22,580
I think I do too much as it is.

3321
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:22,760
Um,

3322
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:27,010
it's too confusing already being a
podcast or slash cage fighting commentator

3323
01:28:27,011 --> 01:28:28,790
slash standup comedian.

3324
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,770
That shit is all too confusing.

3325
01:28:31,030 --> 01:28:31,731
Your UFC,

3326
01:28:31,731 --> 01:28:33,170
you kill it on UFC though.

3327
01:28:33,230 --> 01:28:34,220
That shit is great man.

3328
01:28:34,221 --> 01:28:37,850
I'm not even a big UFC fan but just cause
like when it's on at the bar or if my

3329
01:28:37,851 --> 01:28:38,720
friends are watching,

3330
01:28:38,721 --> 01:28:39,110
it's,

3331
01:28:39,110 --> 01:28:39,310
it's,

3332
01:28:39,310 --> 01:28:41,180
it's fucking dope to see
you on that shit man.

3333
01:28:41,181 --> 01:28:41,650
Thanks man.

3334
01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:41,871
Yeah,

3335
01:28:41,871 --> 01:28:42,561
I enjoy doing it.

3336
01:28:42,561 --> 01:28:43,394
It's fun.

3337
01:28:43,550 --> 01:28:44,670
It's crazy how the,

3338
01:28:44,680 --> 01:28:45,411
the athletes,

3339
01:28:45,411 --> 01:28:46,340
the level of athletes,

3340
01:28:46,341 --> 01:28:47,600
it's just fucking through the roof.

3341
01:28:47,601 --> 01:28:50,300
Now you're getting these
John Jones types characters,

3342
01:28:50,570 --> 01:28:54,800
Anthony Johnson type characters such
as the high level athletes now that

3343
01:28:54,980 --> 01:28:57,770
probably would have been planned other
professional sports like baseball or

3344
01:28:57,771 --> 01:29:00,400
basketball or something like that and
now they're fighting and MMA and you're

3345
01:29:00,420 --> 01:29:01,253
seeing just,

3346
01:29:01,550 --> 01:29:02,383
whew.

3347
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:04,230
Just some high level shit.

3348
01:29:04,231 --> 01:29:04,931
Gladiators.

3349
01:29:04,931 --> 01:29:05,764
Shit.

3350
01:29:05,970 --> 01:29:06,803
I,

3351
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:11,010
I could never imagine fighting
any of those dudes too.

3352
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:11,750
So Shit,

3353
01:29:11,750 --> 01:29:14,040
you gotta want to do that and only that,

3354
01:29:14,590 --> 01:29:16,260
that's gotta be what you want to do.

3355
01:29:16,650 --> 01:29:17,431
There's the people that,

3356
01:29:17,431 --> 01:29:20,520
like David was on the podcast once David
showed and he was talking to you about,

3357
01:29:20,521 --> 01:29:20,731
uh,

3358
01:29:20,731 --> 01:29:21,550
you know,

3359
01:29:21,550 --> 01:29:22,680
wanted to have an MMA fight.

3360
01:29:22,681 --> 01:29:23,010
I'm like,

3361
01:29:23,010 --> 01:29:23,843
don't do it.

3362
01:29:24,090 --> 01:29:24,390
He's like,

3363
01:29:24,390 --> 01:29:25,830
I just want to do it just to say I did it.

3364
01:29:25,831 --> 01:29:25,981
Like,

3365
01:29:25,981 --> 01:29:26,440
don't,

3366
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:27,670
you're going to fight somebody.

3367
01:29:28,510 --> 01:29:31,630
You were fight someone who lives
for it and you can't do that.

3368
01:29:31,660 --> 01:29:34,600
You know your fight some dude and he'll
head kick you and you'll be depressed

3369
01:29:34,601 --> 01:29:35,410
for the rest of your life.

3370
01:29:35,410 --> 01:29:35,640
Yeah.

3371
01:29:35,640 --> 01:29:37,080
Chose so fucking talented.

3372
01:29:37,081 --> 01:29:40,410
And he really can do 99% of
everything he wants to do.

3373
01:29:40,411 --> 01:29:42,240
But UFC is in that 1%.

3374
01:29:42,241 --> 01:29:43,170
It's like chill.

3375
01:29:43,410 --> 01:29:44,580
No matter how talented you are,

3376
01:29:44,581 --> 01:29:45,840
you will get fucked up.

3377
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:46,350
Well,

3378
01:29:46,350 --> 01:29:46,591
I mean,

3379
01:29:46,591 --> 01:29:48,150
if he dedicated his whole life to it,

3380
01:29:48,151 --> 01:29:52,800
I mean from the time he was like 15 on
Twitter's training him like a fucking

3381
01:29:52,801 --> 01:29:56,020
broke his rib critters idea
of being as personal trainers,

3382
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:58,410
like kicking him in the stomach
and it's like take it Dave.

3383
01:29:58,500 --> 01:29:59,333
Did they do that?

3384
01:29:59,340 --> 01:29:59,821
Yeah,

3385
01:29:59,821 --> 01:30:00,990
man in the stomach.

3386
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:01,631
He,

3387
01:30:01,631 --> 01:30:06,120
he broke his ribs somehow training him
and then I remember asking her like,

3388
01:30:06,121 --> 01:30:06,511
what's he doing?

3389
01:30:06,511 --> 01:30:06,720
He's like,

3390
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:06,841
oh,

3391
01:30:06,841 --> 01:30:08,280
I've got Dave like
running down the street,

3392
01:30:08,281 --> 01:30:08,710
man.

3393
01:30:08,710 --> 01:30:09,870
We just wanted it on the street.

3394
01:30:10,930 --> 01:30:12,000
He quit.

3395
01:30:12,001 --> 01:30:13,200
It's going to break Cho.

3396
01:30:14,430 --> 01:30:15,780
But it's perfect for Joe.

3397
01:30:15,781 --> 01:30:18,180
Like to have a guy like
clear no critters the best.

3398
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:20,260
So it was hilarious.

3399
01:30:20,410 --> 01:30:22,120
All that shit that went down
with him while they were,

3400
01:30:22,150 --> 01:30:22,451
you know,

3401
01:30:22,451 --> 01:30:23,290
people were decided.

3402
01:30:23,291 --> 01:30:24,850
There was the same thing that
we were talking about earlier.

3403
01:30:24,851 --> 01:30:27,820
The social justice warriors attacked
him because of the story that he told on

3404
01:30:27,821 --> 01:30:28,654
his podcast.

3405
01:30:28,990 --> 01:30:29,591
But if you know,

3406
01:30:29,591 --> 01:30:30,041
Dave,

3407
01:30:30,041 --> 01:30:33,880
he's got this flair for entertainment
where exaggerates the truth and you know,

3408
01:30:34,090 --> 01:30:36,760
there's no one coming forward
to say that he raped them.

3409
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:37,211
You know,

3410
01:30:37,211 --> 01:30:37,870
this is not like,

3411
01:30:37,870 --> 01:30:39,730
this is like he's bullshitting.

3412
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:42,490
Like it's half bullshitting for fun for,

3413
01:30:42,580 --> 01:30:43,331
for theater,

3414
01:30:43,331 --> 01:30:44,164
for excitement.

3415
01:30:45,730 --> 01:30:47,590
Dude is this these days man,

3416
01:30:47,591 --> 01:30:48,880
you never know what people are just

3417
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:51,920
needing to get upset instead
of actually getting upset,

3418
01:30:51,921 --> 01:30:53,060
they're waiting to get upset.

3419
01:30:53,090 --> 01:30:56,430
And also people have one
perspective only they,

3420
01:30:56,431 --> 01:30:56,690
oh,

3421
01:30:56,690 --> 01:30:57,530
I watched this.

3422
01:30:57,830 --> 01:30:58,880
Here's a perfect example.

3423
01:30:59,570 --> 01:31:00,550
I was online today and I was,

3424
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:05,300
I was following this abortion
debate between these two people.

3425
01:31:05,630 --> 01:31:06,530
And uh,

3426
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:11,680
it was the most bizarre thing ever
where someone was talking about at what,

3427
01:31:12,350 --> 01:31:15,560
at what age does the
fetus becomes a person?

3428
01:31:16,250 --> 01:31:16,931
And the,

3429
01:31:16,931 --> 01:31:21,410
the argument like watching both sides
go back and forth and it wasn't even,

3430
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:24,890
this wasn't even like a right
wing versus left wing side.

3431
01:31:24,950 --> 01:31:25,160
Yeah.

3432
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:28,760
It was like someone who is like an
objective rationalist who was debating

3433
01:31:28,761 --> 01:31:33,500
someone who's a hardcore left winger who
was also like one of these like Super

3434
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:34,520
White Knights defending women.

3435
01:31:34,790 --> 01:31:35,330
You know.

3436
01:31:35,330 --> 01:31:40,100
And one of the arguments was it was so
hilarious that it's a woman's right to

3437
01:31:40,101 --> 01:31:40,641
choose.

3438
01:31:40,641 --> 01:31:44,360
I have no business saying what a woman
should or shouldn't do with her body,

3439
01:31:44,540 --> 01:31:46,880
which is universally like,

3440
01:31:46,930 --> 01:31:48,260
I agree with that as well.

3441
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:51,890
But what they were saying was
this is where it got really crazy.

3442
01:31:52,130 --> 01:31:57,130
No person has the right to exist in
another person's body without permission.

3443
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:00,411
So we're,

3444
01:32:00,411 --> 01:32:05,411
they were saying the argument was that
a baby doesn't have the right to use a

3445
01:32:05,621 --> 01:32:07,480
woman's body without her permission.

3446
01:32:07,481 --> 01:32:07,871
I was like,

3447
01:32:07,871 --> 01:32:09,790
this is fucking crazy,

3448
01:32:10,160 --> 01:32:12,070
baby cannot use a woman's body.

3449
01:32:12,071 --> 01:32:12,360
You were,

3450
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:13,091
they were there.

3451
01:32:13,091 --> 01:32:14,680
So pro woman,

3452
01:32:14,770 --> 01:32:15,620
so pro,

3453
01:32:15,621 --> 01:32:15,751
right?

3454
01:32:15,751 --> 01:32:19,030
Like you were talking about like nine
months in like at what point the real

3455
01:32:19,031 --> 01:32:19,841
debate was,

3456
01:32:19,841 --> 01:32:20,201
and this is,

3457
01:32:20,201 --> 01:32:23,620
I think he's a real debate and this is
again coming from me who's pro choice.

3458
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:27,640
There's a real debate as to when is
that a person and to say that it's not a

3459
01:32:27,641 --> 01:32:28,031
debate,

3460
01:32:28,031 --> 01:32:31,090
it's fucking horseshit to say that it's
not a debate that a woman who gives

3461
01:32:31,091 --> 01:32:34,420
birth tomorrow kills the
baby today and it's her.

3462
01:32:34,450 --> 01:32:35,500
It's her prerogative.

3463
01:32:35,710 --> 01:32:36,180
Like,

3464
01:32:36,180 --> 01:32:36,910
okay,

3465
01:32:36,910 --> 01:32:38,290
really like at what?

3466
01:32:38,291 --> 01:32:39,124
At what time?

3467
01:32:39,340 --> 01:32:40,300
Is this creepy?

3468
01:32:40,540 --> 01:32:40,930
Is it,

3469
01:32:40,930 --> 01:32:45,760
what time is this a born behavior when
someone has a living being inside their

3470
01:32:45,761 --> 01:32:46,990
body was not a living,

3471
01:32:46,991 --> 01:32:50,320
being told to born well was really like,

3472
01:32:50,321 --> 01:32:50,831
come on man.

3473
01:32:50,831 --> 01:32:51,581
There's some you,

3474
01:32:51,581 --> 01:32:56,320
you have to have some flexibility to
your perception because this is a strange

3475
01:32:56,530 --> 01:32:58,850
and very unusual situation
where you're all,

3476
01:32:58,930 --> 01:33:00,520
you can terminate a life.

3477
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:03,040
And when I think you can terminate a line,

3478
01:33:03,050 --> 01:33:03,341
I mean the,

3479
01:33:03,341 --> 01:33:03,441
the,

3480
01:33:03,441 --> 01:33:03,671
the,

3481
01:33:03,671 --> 01:33:03,851
the,

3482
01:33:03,851 --> 01:33:04,061
the,

3483
01:33:04,061 --> 01:33:05,560
the image that they were showing was a,

3484
01:33:05,561 --> 01:33:06,220
um,

3485
01:33:06,220 --> 01:33:08,830
a three day old embryo
and the head of a pin.

3486
01:33:08,890 --> 01:33:10,330
So we started this conversation,

3487
01:33:10,331 --> 01:33:11,740
which just looks like a few cells,

3488
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:17,380
but when it's a fucking baby with an
umbilical cord in a heartbeat and eyes and

3489
01:33:17,381 --> 01:33:18,700
its fingers are moving like,

3490
01:33:18,701 --> 01:33:19,600
whoa.

3491
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:20,680
Yeah,

3492
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:25,680
to pretend that's just the new person
has a right to use a woman's body without

3493
01:33:25,871 --> 01:33:26,471
her permission.

3494
01:33:26,471 --> 01:33:26,651
Like,

3495
01:33:26,651 --> 01:33:27,630
Oh really?

3496
01:33:27,710 --> 01:33:27,941
You're,

3497
01:33:27,941 --> 01:33:32,941
you're absolutely right that there is a
debate that that is being had constantly

3498
01:33:33,161 --> 01:33:35,050
at what point something
becomes a human being.

3499
01:33:35,051 --> 01:33:36,280
Because there are people,

3500
01:33:36,281 --> 01:33:39,490
I mean obviously it's a human
being once it comes out.

3501
01:33:39,550 --> 01:33:39,980
Yeah.

3502
01:33:39,980 --> 01:33:40,200
It's,

3503
01:33:40,200 --> 01:33:41,770
it's not a black and white issue.

3504
01:33:41,771 --> 01:33:42,550
It's just not,

3505
01:33:42,550 --> 01:33:43,120
it's not,

3506
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:43,331
it's,

3507
01:33:43,331 --> 01:33:43,660
it's,

3508
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:44,770
it's very,

3509
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:46,360
I'm super pro choice though.

3510
01:33:46,361 --> 01:33:46,961
And I just,

3511
01:33:46,961 --> 01:33:47,741
as a man,

3512
01:33:47,741 --> 01:33:52,300
I feel like women need to decide what
they want to do with their bodies and you

3513
01:33:52,301 --> 01:33:52,421
know,

3514
01:33:52,421 --> 01:33:54,700
we run so much in this world that for me,

3515
01:33:54,701 --> 01:33:54,990
I,

3516
01:33:54,990 --> 01:33:57,160
I just don't want to
legislate women's bodies.

3517
01:33:57,161 --> 01:33:58,450
Like from my perspective,

3518
01:33:58,480 --> 01:33:58,740
no one,

3519
01:33:58,740 --> 01:34:00,700
no would suck to be in
a personal situation.

3520
01:34:01,090 --> 01:34:04,450
If I had a girl and we were
having a kid eight months in,

3521
01:34:04,451 --> 01:34:05,680
she doesn't like me anymore.

3522
01:34:05,690 --> 01:34:07,030
Doesn't want to have a kid and wants to,

3523
01:34:07,210 --> 01:34:07,570
I mean,

3524
01:34:07,570 --> 01:34:10,390
dude right now would be some shit.

3525
01:34:10,460 --> 01:34:10,641
Well,

3526
01:34:10,641 --> 01:34:11,211
not only that,

3527
01:34:11,211 --> 01:34:14,870
like does a woman even have a right to
tell a woman what you can and can't do

3528
01:34:14,871 --> 01:34:15,380
for her body?

3529
01:34:15,380 --> 01:34:16,820
Obviously a man,

3530
01:34:16,850 --> 01:34:17,720
we don't understand.

3531
01:34:17,721 --> 01:34:18,710
We don't ever get pregnant.

3532
01:34:18,711 --> 01:34:21,110
It's not our concern or it's not a,

3533
01:34:21,111 --> 01:34:23,390
it's not up to us to decide,

3534
01:34:23,391 --> 01:34:24,170
I should say.

3535
01:34:24,170 --> 01:34:25,310
But for a woman,

3536
01:34:25,340 --> 01:34:28,790
can a woman tell another woman that she
can't have an abortion at nine months?

3537
01:34:28,791 --> 01:34:29,540
I mean like what,

3538
01:34:29,540 --> 01:34:30,373
what,

3539
01:34:30,380 --> 01:34:31,940
where do we draw this line

3540
01:34:32,610 --> 01:34:33,271
question too?

3541
01:34:33,271 --> 01:34:37,050
Like where does the government
have an ability to legislate?

3542
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:40,620
Imagine if you were dating someone and
you guys were having a kid and she was

3543
01:34:40,621 --> 01:34:42,630
eight months pregnant and
just on a whim decided,

3544
01:34:42,631 --> 01:34:43,200
you know what,

3545
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:46,650
I feel like I don't want this baby to
be attendant in my stomach anymore.

3546
01:34:47,550 --> 01:34:48,030
Yeah,

3547
01:34:48,030 --> 01:34:48,181
it,

3548
01:34:48,181 --> 01:34:48,871
his baby does not.

3549
01:34:48,871 --> 01:34:51,900
This is a person who does not
have permission to use my body.

3550
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:52,620
Like whoa.

3551
01:34:52,620 --> 01:34:54,120
That was the way they phrased it.

3552
01:34:54,170 --> 01:34:54,410
That

3553
01:34:54,410 --> 01:34:58,790
would really test my intellectual
an end like reasonableness.

3554
01:34:59,030 --> 01:34:59,510
Right.

3555
01:34:59,510 --> 01:35:01,820
That would really put me to the test.

3556
01:35:01,821 --> 01:35:04,190
And that's why when you
think about those situations,

3557
01:35:04,191 --> 01:35:04,460
you're like,

3558
01:35:04,460 --> 01:35:04,821
king,

3559
01:35:04,821 --> 01:35:06,650
we even logically vote on this.

3560
01:35:06,680 --> 01:35:09,680
Like you can't really have an opinion
of vote on this until you're in that

3561
01:35:09,681 --> 01:35:10,281
situation.

3562
01:35:10,281 --> 01:35:11,750
You kind of like needs to be,

3563
01:35:12,740 --> 01:35:12,891
well,

3564
01:35:12,891 --> 01:35:13,611
the person who was,

3565
01:35:13,611 --> 01:35:15,140
who's debating was started insulting.

3566
01:35:15,141 --> 01:35:18,560
I'm the super left wing white knight
person started insulting him and calling

3567
01:35:18,561 --> 01:35:19,071
him an idiot,

3568
01:35:19,071 --> 01:35:22,730
which is always when you know that they're
falling apart in a debate because he

3569
01:35:22,731 --> 01:35:23,450
was saying,

3570
01:35:23,450 --> 01:35:23,781
okay,

3571
01:35:23,781 --> 01:35:27,770
well you were saying before that it's
not a person and now you're saying no

3572
01:35:27,771 --> 01:35:32,150
person has the right to use someone's
body without their permission.

3573
01:35:32,390 --> 01:35:33,680
So what the fuck is it?

3574
01:35:33,710 --> 01:35:34,790
Is it a person?

3575
01:35:35,150 --> 01:35:38,450
Are you killing a person that doesn't
have the right to use your body or is it

3576
01:35:38,451 --> 01:35:39,620
not a person till it's born?

3577
01:35:39,770 --> 01:35:41,870
And then they started
insulting them because they do,

3578
01:35:41,871 --> 01:35:43,700
they realize the moral conundrum,

3579
01:35:43,940 --> 01:35:46,310
the logical conundrum that they're in,

3580
01:35:46,540 --> 01:35:47,060
you know,

3581
01:35:47,060 --> 01:35:47,930
it's a fucking real,

3582
01:35:47,990 --> 01:35:49,580
like there's no black and white there.

3583
01:35:49,610 --> 01:35:50,210
No.

3584
01:35:50,210 --> 01:35:52,310
Whether you're a pro choice
or whether you're prolife,

3585
01:35:52,730 --> 01:35:53,660
that issue is a,

3586
01:35:53,661 --> 01:35:55,940
that is a very bizarre issue.

3587
01:35:56,120 --> 01:35:56,390
Yeah.

3588
01:35:56,390 --> 01:35:59,630
I mean I'm all about women's rights
in and rights over their body.

3589
01:35:59,810 --> 01:36:00,500
That one,

3590
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:01,220
that one,

3591
01:36:01,220 --> 01:36:02,210
I don't have the answer,

3592
01:36:02,420 --> 01:36:05,330
nor do I want to be part of the
decision making to be honest.

3593
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:08,540
Like I just don't feel like I got
the fucking facts for that one kid.

3594
01:36:08,570 --> 01:36:09,920
I don't think anybody has
the facts without one.

3595
01:36:10,010 --> 01:36:11,870
Well that's one of those
things about life itself.

3596
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:15,950
If someone wants to abort a baby at eight
months for no real good reason besides

3597
01:36:15,951 --> 01:36:17,480
just maybe not wanting to pump it out,

3598
01:36:17,481 --> 01:36:18,170
like that's dude,

3599
01:36:18,170 --> 01:36:18,470
that's,

3600
01:36:18,470 --> 01:36:19,490
that's wow.

3601
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:23,150
But there's a lot of people
that are willing to jump
up and defend women and you

3602
01:36:23,151 --> 01:36:23,660
know,

3603
01:36:23,660 --> 01:36:23,881
and,

3604
01:36:23,881 --> 01:36:24,121
and,

3605
01:36:24,121 --> 01:36:25,370
and jump into this,

3606
01:36:25,580 --> 01:36:29,090
this position of being the sort of

3607
01:36:30,790 --> 01:36:31,070
the,

3608
01:36:31,070 --> 01:36:32,150
this defender,

3609
01:36:32,390 --> 01:36:33,230
no matter what,

3610
01:36:33,470 --> 01:36:36,860
this defender of women's rights
in the world is absolute though.

3611
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:39,530
Like that's the thing I think
people have to believe in.

3612
01:36:39,590 --> 01:36:40,011
And also,

3613
01:36:40,011 --> 01:36:40,280
yeah,

3614
01:36:40,280 --> 01:36:42,350
people hold it as like a badge of honor.

3615
01:36:42,730 --> 01:36:45,410
I defend us no matter what
insights they're looking for.

3616
01:36:45,411 --> 01:36:49,970
Social Brownie points instead
of objectively discussing
a very bizarre issue.

3617
01:36:50,180 --> 01:36:50,430
Well,

3618
01:36:50,430 --> 01:36:51,770
it's a very bizarre issue.

3619
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:52,610
Abortions.

3620
01:36:52,610 --> 01:36:53,443
Bizarre.

3621
01:36:53,540 --> 01:36:54,770
And even you brought up tow,

3622
01:36:54,771 --> 01:36:55,011
right?

3623
01:36:55,011 --> 01:36:55,490
I love,

3624
01:36:55,490 --> 01:36:57,350
we all love Chow and that,

3625
01:36:57,530 --> 01:37:01,400
that podcast episode with
the misuse rape story,

3626
01:37:01,790 --> 01:37:02,001
Dude,

3627
01:37:02,001 --> 01:37:05,270
that put me in a tough spot
that put me in a tough spot,

3628
01:37:05,271 --> 01:37:06,104
dude.

3629
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:06,680
You know,

3630
01:37:06,680 --> 01:37:07,513
and like I,

3631
01:37:07,580 --> 01:37:10,130
people were calling me and
asking me and they're like,

3632
01:37:10,160 --> 01:37:11,300
you're an Asian man too.

3633
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:13,190
Do you think this is an
Asian male anchor thing?

3634
01:37:13,191 --> 01:37:13,970
And I was like,

3635
01:37:13,970 --> 01:37:14,211
Yo,

3636
01:37:14,211 --> 01:37:14,631
number one,

3637
01:37:14,631 --> 01:37:17,810
this has nothing to do with nothing to
do with what part of the country your

3638
01:37:17,811 --> 01:37:18,950
ancestors came from.

3639
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:20,060
That's crazy.

3640
01:37:20,060 --> 01:37:20,870
And I'm just like,

3641
01:37:20,870 --> 01:37:22,010
but I can't,

3642
01:37:22,580 --> 01:37:23,413
I mean,

3643
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:24,890
he's the,

3644
01:37:24,890 --> 01:37:29,240
he's the homie and so like I know
who he is and I know his intentions,

3645
01:37:29,241 --> 01:37:30,470
but if I didn't know him,

3646
01:37:31,100 --> 01:37:31,460
yeah,

3647
01:37:31,460 --> 01:37:32,750
I'd be tight at that.

3648
01:37:32,810 --> 01:37:34,700
Like that's if you really did that,

3649
01:37:34,701 --> 01:37:35,660
like I never asked him,

3650
01:37:35,661 --> 01:37:36,051
but I'm like,

3651
01:37:36,051 --> 01:37:37,790
if you really did like in my mind,

3652
01:37:37,791 --> 01:37:38,030
I'm like,

3653
01:37:38,030 --> 01:37:38,863
if you did that,

3654
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:40,490
I don't know if he could be friends,

3655
01:37:40,491 --> 01:37:41,324
Homey,

3656
01:37:42,380 --> 01:37:43,213
you know?

3657
01:37:43,460 --> 01:37:43,611
Well,

3658
01:37:43,611 --> 01:37:44,870
what did exactly did he say?

3659
01:37:44,871 --> 01:37:46,250
He said that he asked her to touch it.

3660
01:37:46,251 --> 01:37:50,390
She started jerking him off and then he
grabbed her head and it has her suck and

3661
01:37:50,391 --> 01:37:51,380
she didn't want to.

3662
01:37:51,380 --> 01:37:53,640
And then he grabbed her head and
then started mouth fucking her.

3663
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:54,090
Yeah,

3664
01:37:54,090 --> 01:37:54,651
that's what he said,

3665
01:37:54,651 --> 01:37:54,960
right?

3666
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:55,560
Yeah.

3667
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:55,920
Yeah.

3668
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:56,371
It's a whole,

3669
01:37:56,371 --> 01:37:57,720
it's so bizarre.

3670
01:37:58,230 --> 01:37:59,520
I get so David Cho,

3671
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:00,600
it's so chill.

3672
01:38:00,630 --> 01:38:01,830
It's really the line,

3673
01:38:01,831 --> 01:38:05,880
like the motherfucker just
stands on the line and you know,

3674
01:38:05,881 --> 01:38:06,870
you look,

3675
01:38:06,871 --> 01:38:09,940
if you're a woman and you heard that and
you'd imagine being this poor woman who

3676
01:38:09,941 --> 01:38:12,750
was a massage therapist who's being
probably doesn't speak English,

3677
01:38:13,140 --> 01:38:15,960
taking this millionaire
guys money and you really,

3678
01:38:15,961 --> 01:38:16,500
you know,

3679
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:16,920
you can't,

3680
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:18,300
you shove them out.

3681
01:38:18,301 --> 01:38:19,680
That's pretty indefensible dude.

3682
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:22,260
She's already jerking him off.

3683
01:38:22,261 --> 01:38:22,441
I mean,

3684
01:38:22,441 --> 01:38:23,160
what's up dad?

3685
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:23,261
No,

3686
01:38:23,261 --> 01:38:23,381
no,

3687
01:38:23,381 --> 01:38:23,491
no,

3688
01:38:23,491 --> 01:38:23,591
no,

3689
01:38:23,591 --> 01:38:23,731
no.

3690
01:38:23,731 --> 01:38:24,630
She didn't want to,

3691
01:38:24,780 --> 01:38:26,340
she just tells him want to lose her job.

3692
01:38:26,341 --> 01:38:27,030
I'd like,

3693
01:38:27,030 --> 01:38:27,211
Yo,

3694
01:38:27,211 --> 01:38:27,460
I've,

3695
01:38:27,460 --> 01:38:29,120
I'm been with women where even like,

3696
01:38:29,330 --> 01:38:29,610
I,

3697
01:38:29,610 --> 01:38:31,410
I'm so careful with this shit.

3698
01:38:31,650 --> 01:38:32,431
You never know.

3699
01:38:32,431 --> 01:38:35,160
Like I'll be dating and grow for
a couple of years and it's just,

3700
01:38:35,161 --> 01:38:35,994
you know,

3701
01:38:36,440 --> 01:38:37,920
no forcible blowjob.

3702
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:38,370
Do you know what I mean?

3703
01:38:38,370 --> 01:38:38,970
I just can't,

3704
01:38:38,970 --> 01:38:40,260
I can't do it like I,

3705
01:38:40,510 --> 01:38:42,750
but I dated a girl who used to like that.

3706
01:38:42,990 --> 01:38:43,823
That was her thing.

3707
01:38:44,010 --> 01:38:47,910
She to watch porn where guys were like
grabbing the back of a girl's head and

3708
01:38:47,911 --> 01:38:49,200
forcing the head on,

3709
01:38:49,260 --> 01:38:50,093
on her chair.

3710
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:50,611
And I was like,

3711
01:38:50,611 --> 01:38:51,360
why do you like that?

3712
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:51,571
I mean,

3713
01:38:51,571 --> 01:38:55,140
if somebody gives me the Asian Joe Pesci
role and I have to force ginger to suck

3714
01:38:55,141 --> 01:38:55,620
my Dick,

3715
01:38:55,620 --> 01:38:57,270
I'm going to be morally compromised.

3716
01:38:57,900 --> 01:38:59,590
I don't do that in my normal life.

3717
01:38:59,610 --> 01:38:59,730
Yeah,

3718
01:38:59,730 --> 01:39:00,890
but it's a role.

3719
01:39:02,350 --> 01:39:04,170
But if you're dating a
girl and that's her thing,

3720
01:39:04,171 --> 01:39:05,250
she likes you to grab her head.

3721
01:39:05,251 --> 01:39:05,431
I mean,

3722
01:39:05,431 --> 01:39:06,570
it's not involuntary.

3723
01:39:06,660 --> 01:39:08,520
She wants to do this beforehand.

3724
01:39:08,650 --> 01:39:10,560
And she signs the papers when my lawyer,

3725
01:39:10,650 --> 01:39:12,720
so that for the next six months I can,

3726
01:39:12,721 --> 01:39:13,110
you know,

3727
01:39:13,110 --> 01:39:13,561
do this.

3728
01:39:13,561 --> 01:39:14,820
And that's what you want.

3729
01:39:14,970 --> 01:39:15,780
Sure.

3730
01:39:15,780 --> 01:39:17,850
Have you ever seen that
Louis Ck joke about that?

3731
01:39:17,910 --> 01:39:18,430
No.

3732
01:39:18,430 --> 01:39:18,950
He does it.

3733
01:39:18,950 --> 01:39:21,180
He's dating some girl or
hooks up with some girl.

3734
01:39:21,181 --> 01:39:23,400
They started making out and he
tries to have sex or she says no,

3735
01:39:23,401 --> 01:39:25,980
and then he sees the
next day and she goes,

3736
01:39:25,981 --> 01:39:26,940
what happened last night?

3737
01:39:27,270 --> 01:39:27,880
And he goes,

3738
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:28,713
what do you mean?

3739
01:39:28,740 --> 01:39:29,220
She goes,

3740
01:39:29,220 --> 01:39:29,580
well,

3741
01:39:29,580 --> 01:39:30,660
why didn't we have sex?

3742
01:39:30,690 --> 01:39:31,140
He goes,

3743
01:39:31,140 --> 01:39:31,890
well,

3744
01:39:31,890 --> 01:39:32,730
I tried,

3745
01:39:32,731 --> 01:39:34,290
but you didn't want to.

3746
01:39:34,470 --> 01:39:34,711
She goes,

3747
01:39:34,711 --> 01:39:34,921
no,

3748
01:39:34,921 --> 01:39:35,754
I did.

3749
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:36,481
And he goes,

3750
01:39:36,481 --> 01:39:36,691
well,

3751
01:39:36,691 --> 01:39:37,320
why?

3752
01:39:37,320 --> 01:39:38,220
Why did you say no?

3753
01:39:38,221 --> 01:39:38,491
She goes,

3754
01:39:38,491 --> 01:39:38,631
why?

3755
01:39:38,631 --> 01:39:40,020
I was hoping you would just go for it.

3756
01:39:40,260 --> 01:39:40,591
He goes,

3757
01:39:40,591 --> 01:39:41,424
what?

3758
01:39:41,970 --> 01:39:45,990
You wanted me to rape you on the off
chance that you're into that shit?

3759
01:39:46,430 --> 01:39:46,680
No,

3760
01:39:46,680 --> 01:39:47,513
she got,

3761
01:39:47,670 --> 01:39:48,690
that's the dance.

3762
01:39:48,691 --> 01:39:51,090
The shorty that like fucks everybody.

3763
01:39:51,240 --> 01:39:55,350
Not only are you fucking women and
women's body image and women's rights,

3764
01:39:55,351 --> 01:39:57,780
but now you're fucking dude's
cause now you just taught to do,

3765
01:39:57,781 --> 01:39:58,171
to move,

3766
01:39:58,171 --> 01:39:59,970
like rubbing your elbow into the boobs.

3767
01:40:00,280 --> 01:40:02,430
I mean like now you just,

3768
01:40:02,431 --> 01:40:04,650
now you put a really
bad tool in the toolbox.

3769
01:40:04,770 --> 01:40:05,131
Yeah.

3770
01:40:05,131 --> 01:40:08,290
It's not because the next
time Louis C K gets to that.

3771
01:40:08,430 --> 01:40:09,420
Oh it means,

3772
01:40:09,421 --> 01:40:10,190
yes,

3773
01:40:10,190 --> 01:40:11,220
it's a great bit.

3774
01:40:11,250 --> 01:40:14,820
It's a great bit because
any man who dates more than,

3775
01:40:14,821 --> 01:40:15,091
you know,

3776
01:40:15,091 --> 01:40:15,901
x amount of women,

3777
01:40:15,901 --> 01:40:19,530
it's going to come across when you're
going to come across in an aberration,

3778
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:23,610
a very rare person who has were like
this girl that I used to date who wanted

3779
01:40:23,611 --> 01:40:24,870
guys to grab her head,

3780
01:40:24,871 --> 01:40:25,860
force it on her dick.

3781
01:40:26,330 --> 01:40:27,540
Like she wanted a blow me,

3782
01:40:27,541 --> 01:40:28,740
but she wanted me to grab it.

3783
01:40:28,741 --> 01:40:29,311
She would like,

3784
01:40:29,311 --> 01:40:30,420
I dated her for awhile.

3785
01:40:30,630 --> 01:40:31,500
She was her shit.

3786
01:40:31,501 --> 01:40:32,580
That was what she was into.

3787
01:40:33,570 --> 01:40:37,260
She wanted to get on her knees and she
wants you to grab the back of her head

3788
01:40:37,290 --> 01:40:38,310
and like face fucker.

3789
01:40:38,340 --> 01:40:38,910

I've been in a situation where
it's like I want to be choked,

3792
01:40:42,440 --> 01:40:42,870

3793

01:40:50,570 --> 01:40:51,540
So I'll do it.

3796
01:40:51,541 --> 01:40:51,841

01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:56,801
I'll always be like,

3801
01:40:56,801 --> 01:40:57,251
Yo man,

3802
01:40:57,251 --> 01:40:58,420
like is something wrong?

3803
01:40:58,421 --> 01:40:59,260
Like you okay?

3804
01:40:59,261 --> 01:41:01,690
Like what the fuck did your dad do to you?

3805
01:41:01,720 --> 01:41:02,051
You know,

3806
01:41:02,051 --> 01:41:03,400
and I'm always kind of just like,

3807
01:41:03,430 --> 01:41:04,960
Yo this like he can't like,

3808
01:41:04,961 --> 01:41:06,700
cause I would never want
to be punched in the face.

3809
01:41:08,340 --> 01:41:11,350
You're a guy and I think
there's also a different,

3810
01:41:11,351 --> 01:41:12,130
like women,

3811
01:41:12,130 --> 01:41:15,070
there are women who have
legitimate rape fantasies.

3812
01:41:15,110 --> 01:41:16,930
It's a social structural thing though.

3813
01:41:16,931 --> 01:41:19,650
Like if it is it or is it a dude?

3814
01:41:19,660 --> 01:41:21,400
One masculine and feminine thing.

3815
01:41:22,240 --> 01:41:23,620
Definitely men who want to be raped.

3816
01:41:23,650 --> 01:41:23,861
No,

3817
01:41:23,861 --> 01:41:24,310
Dang.

3818
01:41:24,310 --> 01:41:24,730
Yeah.

3819
01:41:24,730 --> 01:41:25,350
Why do you think,

3820
01:41:25,350 --> 01:41:26,700
Oh hell no.

3821
01:41:26,710 --> 01:41:27,530
Not Jamie,

3822
01:41:27,530 --> 01:41:29,140
but I have a friend who
likes getting tied up,

3823
01:41:29,141 --> 01:41:29,650
man.

3824
01:41:29,650 --> 01:41:30,820
He likes girls to beat him up.

3825
01:41:30,850 --> 01:41:30,971
Oh,

3826
01:41:30,971 --> 01:41:31,804
that's right.

3827
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:31,961
No,

3828
01:41:31,961 --> 01:41:32,351
you're right.

3829
01:41:32,351 --> 01:41:33,480
You're right there aren't there are.

3830
01:41:33,500 --> 01:41:35,080
He likes being abused at all.

3831
01:41:35,080 --> 01:41:37,600
I'm glad you brought that up cause
I was about to chalk it up to like,

3832
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:40,510
we live in a patriarchal society
and we treat them like shit.

3833
01:41:40,511 --> 01:41:42,100
And that's must be why they want this.

3834
01:41:42,101 --> 01:41:42,581
But you're right,

3835
01:41:42,581 --> 01:41:42,910
there are,

3836
01:41:42,910 --> 01:41:43,960
there are dudes too.

3837
01:41:44,290 --> 01:41:44,740
Yeah,

3838
01:41:44,740 --> 01:41:45,070
there's,

3839
01:41:45,070 --> 01:41:50,070
there's people that it's not easy to
nail down single spot on the spectrum and

3840
01:41:50,711 --> 01:41:51,070
there's no,

3841
01:41:51,070 --> 01:41:51,521
I mean there's,

3842
01:41:51,521 --> 01:41:51,761
look,

3843
01:41:51,761 --> 01:41:53,590
there's men who wished there were women.

3844
01:41:53,591 --> 01:41:55,150
There's women who wished there was men.

3845
01:41:55,151 --> 01:41:57,880
There's men who'd like to beat
women as women who like to beat men.

3846
01:41:58,060 --> 01:41:59,740
There's men who like to
get beat up by women.

3847
01:41:59,820 --> 01:42:00,061
There's a,

3848
01:42:00,061 --> 01:42:00,610
there's like,

3849
01:42:00,610 --> 01:42:05,170
I think the end of the story is basically
just like sexually people are fucked

3850
01:42:05,980 --> 01:42:07,120
and there's no normal,

3851
01:42:07,300 --> 01:42:08,200
there's no normal,

3852
01:42:08,230 --> 01:42:09,910
there's no new customer's always right.

3853
01:42:11,740 --> 01:42:12,221
There's a,

3854
01:42:12,221 --> 01:42:16,390
there's a law that they're passing in
California called the Yes means yes law.

3855
01:42:16,420 --> 01:42:18,910
And the idea is you're
supposed to get verbal consent.

3856
01:42:19,060 --> 01:42:21,730
The idea is to curb these
college rape issues,

3857
01:42:21,731 --> 01:42:22,810
which are constantly,

3858
01:42:23,020 --> 01:42:23,950
and a lot of them,

3859
01:42:23,951 --> 01:42:27,730
they think they think there's one way
to mitigate that is to make sure that

3860
01:42:27,731 --> 01:42:28,570
people communicate.

3861
01:42:28,571 --> 01:42:32,710
Because like sometimes like things are
just happening and women like feel awful

3862
01:42:32,711 --> 01:42:33,550
about it afterwards,

3863
01:42:33,551 --> 01:42:35,680
but they didn't know how to
stop it when it was going on.

3864
01:42:35,950 --> 01:42:38,680
So the idea being that a guy has
to say every step of the way,

3865
01:42:38,860 --> 01:42:39,970
can I take your clothes off?

3866
01:42:39,971 --> 01:42:41,080
Can I put my finger in you?

3867
01:42:41,081 --> 01:42:41,580
Can I,

3868
01:42:41,580 --> 01:42:41,860
you know,

3869
01:42:41,860 --> 01:42:42,910
put my dick inside you.

3870
01:42:42,911 --> 01:42:43,481
Can I do this?

3871
01:42:43,481 --> 01:42:44,314
Can I do that?

3872
01:42:44,380 --> 01:42:49,180
And there's like a video that accompanies
it called consent is sexy and it's

3873
01:42:49,181 --> 01:42:49,811
hilarious.

3874
01:42:49,811 --> 01:42:53,860
It's weird campaign where you get this
hipster looking dude with a goofy fucking

3875
01:42:53,861 --> 01:42:57,190
beard and he just looks like a kind of
a bitch and he's with this really hot

3876
01:42:57,191 --> 01:42:57,791
girl and he's like,

3877
01:42:57,791 --> 01:42:58,390
can I kiss you?

3878
01:42:58,390 --> 01:42:58,870
Yes.

3879
01:42:58,870 --> 01:42:59,411
And the kisses,

3880
01:42:59,411 --> 01:43:00,190
it was just like ordering,

3881
01:43:00,190 --> 01:43:00,941
take your shirt off.

3882
01:43:00,941 --> 01:43:01,570
Sandwich.

3883
01:43:01,570 --> 01:43:02,040
Not yet.

3884
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:02,440
Yes.

3885
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:03,221
Francina yes.

3886
01:43:03,221 --> 01:43:03,730
Olives.

3887
01:43:03,730 --> 01:43:04,810
Like that's fucking weird.

3888
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:05,830
And she asks him,

3889
01:43:05,831 --> 01:43:06,581
can I touch your leg?

3890
01:43:06,581 --> 01:43:06,791
He's like,

3891
01:43:06,791 --> 01:43:06,951
yeah.

3892
01:43:06,951 --> 01:43:07,160
It's like,

3893
01:43:07,160 --> 01:43:07,840
oh,

3894
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:08,800
let's just get this straight.

3895
01:43:08,801 --> 01:43:10,270
You can do whatever the fuck you want.

3896
01:43:10,271 --> 01:43:10,571
Okay.

3897
01:43:10,571 --> 01:43:11,740
You got the green light honey?

3898
01:43:11,830 --> 01:43:12,071
Yeah.

3899
01:43:12,071 --> 01:43:14,140
He's telling me when I can
stick it in the fucking,

3900
01:43:14,141 --> 01:43:15,160
the easy pass.

3901
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:16,233
Just like,

3902
01:43:16,900 --> 01:43:17,860
yeah,

3903
01:43:18,280 --> 01:43:19,570
put that shit on her forehead.

3904
01:43:19,750 --> 01:43:20,920
It's like a Turkey tester.

3905
01:43:20,921 --> 01:43:21,710
See that point?

3906
01:43:21,710 --> 01:43:22,660
So that's sticking out.

3907
01:43:22,940 --> 01:43:23,780
Go like that's,

3908
01:43:24,010 --> 01:43:24,221
yeah,

3909
01:43:24,221 --> 01:43:25,420
it's just like this.

3910
01:43:25,470 --> 01:43:26,680
You're at the casino buffet.

3911
01:43:26,681 --> 01:43:27,514
Just bring your plate,

3912
01:43:27,850 --> 01:43:28,780
fucking eat everything.

3913
01:43:29,380 --> 01:43:33,820
I'm going to put a fucking of a thing
over your neck on a lanyard while you're

3914
01:43:33,821 --> 01:43:34,301
wearing that.

3915
01:43:34,301 --> 01:43:35,410
You could do whatever you want.

3916
01:43:35,800 --> 01:43:36,880
Touch me any way you want.

3917
01:43:36,910 --> 01:43:37,780
You've got a green light,

3918
01:43:38,200 --> 01:43:39,520
but you know like a girl saying,

3919
01:43:39,521 --> 01:43:40,370
can I touch your leg?

3920
01:43:40,370 --> 01:43:41,203
And the kind of yes,

3921
01:43:41,230 --> 01:43:42,340
like get the fuck out of here.

3922
01:43:42,460 --> 01:43:43,293
What guys that were said,

3923
01:43:43,330 --> 01:43:45,120
I didn't give you
permission to touch my leg.

3924
01:43:45,540 --> 01:43:45,880
Yes.

3925
01:43:45,880 --> 01:43:47,530
Museum shows during judgment.

3926
01:43:47,870 --> 01:43:49,210
It also the asshole in me.

3927
01:43:49,211 --> 01:43:51,010
Like I would have more fun,

3928
01:43:51,020 --> 01:43:52,940
like just fuck fucking with them.

3929
01:43:52,941 --> 01:43:53,960
Then actually fucking them.

3930
01:43:54,170 --> 01:43:54,861
Like if they were like,

3931
01:43:54,861 --> 01:43:56,150
can I touch your leg and be like,

3932
01:43:56,151 --> 01:43:57,500
just this area here.

3933
01:43:58,180 --> 01:43:59,013
You know,

3934
01:43:59,150 --> 01:44:00,380
only an inch above Miami.

3935
01:44:01,040 --> 01:44:02,660
Don't disrespect your thigh.

3936
01:44:02,661 --> 01:44:04,280
Five inches below my taint,

3937
01:44:04,281 --> 01:44:05,500
three and above the knee.

3938
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:06,620
You're safe.

3939
01:44:06,620 --> 01:44:07,550
You touch anything else?

3940
01:44:07,551 --> 01:44:08,384
I'll fucking cut.

3941
01:44:09,180 --> 01:44:11,180
Well there was a guy who
was debating it and he was,

3942
01:44:11,420 --> 01:44:11,661
well,

3943
01:44:11,661 --> 01:44:15,260
he was arguing with this yes means yes
thing and he had this really important

3944
01:44:15,261 --> 01:44:15,770
point.

3945
01:44:15,770 --> 01:44:19,040
He said there was a moment that
happened to me when I was in college.

3946
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:19,641
He goes,

3947
01:44:19,641 --> 01:44:19,761
where?

3948
01:44:19,761 --> 01:44:20,571
I met this girl,

3949
01:44:20,571 --> 01:44:23,440
we were at a bar and I had
a couple of drinks we had.

3950
01:44:23,630 --> 01:44:24,500
We'd never talked.

3951
01:44:24,590 --> 01:44:25,371
She looked at me,

3952
01:44:25,371 --> 01:44:28,550
I looked at her and she raised her
eyebrows and she went like that,

3953
01:44:28,551 --> 01:44:28,840
like,

3954
01:44:28,840 --> 01:44:29,720
like this come here.

3955
01:44:29,960 --> 01:44:32,000
And the guy walked towards her.

3956
01:44:32,060 --> 01:44:32,930
She put her hand out,

3957
01:44:32,931 --> 01:44:33,651
he grabbed her hand,

3958
01:44:33,651 --> 01:44:34,950
he took her into the woman's bathroom,

3959
01:44:34,951 --> 01:44:36,800
have fucked her in a stall and he said,

3960
01:44:36,801 --> 01:44:37,820
we never talked.

3961
01:44:38,030 --> 01:44:38,301
He goes,

3962
01:44:38,301 --> 01:44:41,900
it was one of the greatest nights of
my life because I've jerked off like a

3963
01:44:41,900 --> 01:44:42,830
hundred times since then.

3964
01:44:42,831 --> 01:44:43,664
Thinking about it.

3965
01:44:43,730 --> 01:44:45,170
I never talked to her again.

3966
01:44:45,171 --> 01:44:45,620
I never,

3967
01:44:45,620 --> 01:44:46,040
we never,

3968
01:44:46,040 --> 01:44:47,600
we didn't become boyfriend and girlfriend.

3969
01:44:47,750 --> 01:44:49,010
I didn't speak to this girl.

3970
01:44:49,100 --> 01:44:49,700
We didn't expect,

3971
01:44:49,700 --> 01:44:50,540
we didn't exchange words.

3972
01:44:50,541 --> 01:44:51,090
It was allowed.

3973
01:44:51,090 --> 01:44:51,923
Cub

3974
01:44:52,970 --> 01:44:53,930
went into the bathroom with her.

3975
01:44:53,931 --> 01:44:54,030
Any,

3976
01:44:54,030 --> 01:44:54,863
they fucked,

3977
01:44:55,130 --> 01:44:55,601
they fucked.

3978
01:44:55,601 --> 01:44:56,600
They didn't even know each other.

3979
01:44:56,840 --> 01:44:57,291
And he's like,

3980
01:44:57,291 --> 01:45:00,170
this could not happen
with his yes means yes.

3981
01:45:00,171 --> 01:45:00,391
Shit.

3982
01:45:00,391 --> 01:45:01,970
And it was the greatest night of my life.

3983
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:04,250
I don't mean that he goes,

3984
01:45:04,251 --> 01:45:06,740
it was instigated by a
girl like you and me,

3985
01:45:06,741 --> 01:45:07,670
the of face,

3986
01:45:07,671 --> 01:45:08,450
you know,

3987
01:45:08,450 --> 01:45:10,490
and grabbing my hand
and next thing you know,

3988
01:45:10,491 --> 01:45:12,620
we're in a bathroom and we're having sex.

3989
01:45:13,130 --> 01:45:13,311
You know,

3990
01:45:13,311 --> 01:45:17,930
like that kind of Shit does happen
with people and pretty much every girl,

3991
01:45:17,931 --> 01:45:20,420
I mean the thing you try to block
it out when were in relationship,

3992
01:45:20,421 --> 01:45:22,550
but pretty much every girl
you know is given a bathroom,

3993
01:45:22,551 --> 01:45:23,360
blowjob,

3994
01:45:23,360 --> 01:45:24,193
you know what I mean?

3995
01:45:24,350 --> 01:45:25,130
Sorry guys.

3996
01:45:25,130 --> 01:45:27,570
All your wives taking a bath was,

3997
01:45:27,710 --> 01:45:28,850
is what it is.

3998
01:45:28,851 --> 01:45:30,410
You have to access like boys,

3999
01:45:30,411 --> 01:45:31,400
boys like girls,

4000
01:45:31,401 --> 01:45:34,250
some boys like boys and girls
like girls who gives a fuck.

4001
01:45:34,370 --> 01:45:35,151
It's fine.

4002
01:45:35,151 --> 01:45:40,040
And bathrooms are totally fucking
fine places for our comments to come.

4003
01:45:40,050 --> 01:45:41,390
Common motherfuckers are warming.

4004
01:45:41,450 --> 01:45:42,283
Exactly.

4005
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:44,030
And it's like to legislate.

4006
01:45:44,031 --> 01:45:44,841
This shit is just like,

4007
01:45:44,841 --> 01:45:45,800
come on man.

4008
01:45:46,010 --> 01:45:46,730
It's not the way.

4009
01:45:46,730 --> 01:45:49,220
The way is education
more than legislation.

4010
01:45:49,250 --> 01:45:49,851
That's the way,

4011
01:45:49,851 --> 01:45:52,660
but how do you educate a
kid that's 18 years old?

4012
01:45:52,661 --> 01:45:54,710
I grew up at douchebag
parents and he's got,

4013
01:45:54,780 --> 01:45:55,070
you know,

4014
01:45:55,070 --> 01:45:57,320
some sort of a sociopathic mindset.

4015
01:45:57,800 --> 01:46:01,910
It's like how do you educate people
out of that besides psychedelic drugs

4016
01:46:01,990 --> 01:46:06,990
besides some total reset of the mind
with Ibogaine Iowasca or DMT or mushrooms

4017
01:46:07,761 --> 01:46:10,460
without that and even
that doesn't always work.

4018
01:46:10,461 --> 01:46:13,550
There's people that are fucking complete
sociopath that have done all kinds of

4019
01:46:13,551 --> 01:46:14,384
psychedelics.

4020
01:46:14,690 --> 01:46:16,520
I know people that are
out of their fucking mind,

4021
01:46:16,550 --> 01:46:21,550
Eagle maniacs that are like purportedly
psychedelic users and I'm like,

4022
01:46:21,831 --> 01:46:23,390
how was that guy was like a delegate.

4023
01:46:23,570 --> 01:46:25,160
He doesn't check himself at all.

4024
01:46:25,161 --> 01:46:28,280
He's not looking at himself
introspectively at all.

4025
01:46:28,790 --> 01:46:29,870
So it doesn't work on everybody,

4026
01:46:29,871 --> 01:46:30,111
man.

4027
01:46:30,111 --> 01:46:30,944
There's no every,

4028
01:46:31,160 --> 01:46:32,810
it's like we were saying the spectrum.

4029
01:46:32,840 --> 01:46:33,770
It's just giant.

4030
01:46:34,090 --> 01:46:34,851
It's giant.

4031
01:46:34,851 --> 01:46:36,200
We are so fucking weird.

4032
01:46:36,350 --> 01:46:38,510
Humans are just fucking weird bro.

4033
01:46:38,600 --> 01:46:42,380
It was weird and I almost think like
we have to be weird in order to,

4034
01:46:43,350 --> 01:46:45,830
in order for this super organism to exist,

4035
01:46:45,831 --> 01:46:46,970
the way exists and function,

4036
01:46:46,971 --> 01:46:47,751
the way it functions,

4037
01:46:47,751 --> 01:46:49,190
and in order for innovation,

4038
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:49,980
culture and

4039
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:51,060
society to exist,

4040
01:46:51,450 --> 01:46:54,480
it almost seems like everybody
has to play this very weird,

4041
01:46:54,481 --> 01:46:55,530
unique role.

4042
01:46:55,950 --> 01:47:00,000
And some people are pretty obvious and
pretty straight forward and cookie cutter

4043
01:47:00,001 --> 01:47:00,330
and you're like,

4044
01:47:00,330 --> 01:47:00,481
oh,

4045
01:47:00,481 --> 01:47:01,560
I see one of these before.

4046
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:03,030
And then other people you meet him,

4047
01:47:03,031 --> 01:47:03,331
you're like,

4048
01:47:03,331 --> 01:47:03,721
whoa,

4049
01:47:03,721 --> 01:47:04,940
this bitch is crazy.

4050
01:47:04,980 --> 01:47:05,370
You know?

4051
01:47:05,370 --> 01:47:09,420
I want people to be as weird
as they possibly can as
long as it doesn't infringe

4052
01:47:09,421 --> 01:47:11,310
on my ability to be weird myself.

4053
01:47:11,820 --> 01:47:12,690
Let's say you go,

4054
01:47:12,840 --> 01:47:13,321
that's it.

4055
01:47:13,321 --> 01:47:16,950
That's like the basis of the social
contract and this is the guy I want you to

4056
01:47:16,951 --> 01:47:18,000
be fucking psycho.

4057
01:47:18,420 --> 01:47:18,601
Yeah.

4058
01:47:18,601 --> 01:47:22,980
The weird thing is like when someone tries
to prevent you from being who you are

4059
01:47:22,981 --> 01:47:25,080
because whatever you enjoy offends them,

4060
01:47:25,110 --> 01:47:29,460
even if it doesn't hurt anybody or if
your desires like requires somebody else

4061
01:47:29,461 --> 01:47:30,271
to be victimized,

4062
01:47:30,271 --> 01:47:31,104
like then that's,

4063
01:47:31,460 --> 01:47:32,190
that's too weird.

4064
01:47:32,190 --> 01:47:32,670
But that's,

4065
01:47:32,670 --> 01:47:33,361
that's different.

4066
01:47:33,361 --> 01:47:38,361
But as long as no one's being hurt and
everyone is agreeable upon the act,

4067
01:47:38,940 --> 01:47:40,800
like it's like gay
marriage or gay sex at all.

4068
01:47:40,801 --> 01:47:43,560
Like anybody who's got an issue with
people that are fucking each other.

4069
01:47:43,860 --> 01:47:44,880
Like what do you care?

4070
01:47:45,230 --> 01:47:47,730
Like what is it about you,

4071
01:47:47,820 --> 01:47:49,950
whether it's religion or whether it's,

4072
01:47:49,951 --> 01:47:50,310
uh,

4073
01:47:50,310 --> 01:47:50,730
you know,

4074
01:47:50,730 --> 01:47:51,630
social issues.

4075
01:47:51,631 --> 01:47:54,540
What is it about you that
gives a fuck with someone does,

4076
01:47:54,541 --> 01:47:58,970
if two chicks want to live with each
other and put on rubber strap ons and plow

4077
01:47:58,980 --> 01:47:59,880
each other all day,

4078
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,200
why does that freak you out?

4079
01:48:01,240 --> 01:48:02,073
Enjoy.

4080
01:48:02,190 --> 01:48:02,580
Enjoy.

4081
01:48:02,580 --> 01:48:03,050
You know,

4082
01:48:03,050 --> 01:48:03,631
the big world.

4083
01:48:03,631 --> 01:48:05,010
It's not like there's only five people.

4084
01:48:05,070 --> 01:48:05,490
Yeah.

4085
01:48:05,490 --> 01:48:05,851
You know,

4086
01:48:05,851 --> 01:48:06,870
you could do it upstairs from me.

4087
01:48:06,871 --> 01:48:07,704
I don't care.

4088
01:48:07,820 --> 01:48:08,820
You're whatever.

4089
01:48:09,040 --> 01:48:09,873
If you're loud.

4090
01:48:10,430 --> 01:48:11,870
Live on those all departments.

4091
01:48:11,880 --> 01:48:12,900
That squeaky floors.

4092
01:48:13,260 --> 01:48:14,820
I love noise when I'm sleeping.

4093
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:16,410
I need noise.

4094
01:48:16,440 --> 01:48:16,741
Yeah.

4095
01:48:16,741 --> 01:48:18,030
I have to like turn the TV on,

4096
01:48:18,031 --> 01:48:19,680
leave the TV on and shit real.

4097
01:48:19,681 --> 01:48:20,041
Yeah.

4098
01:48:20,041 --> 01:48:20,480
I don't like,

4099
01:48:20,480 --> 01:48:21,840
I don't like quiet when I sleep.

4100
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:22,410
Wow.

4101
01:48:22,410 --> 01:48:23,190
That's weird.

4102
01:48:23,190 --> 01:48:24,020
Maybe like New York,

4103
01:48:24,020 --> 01:48:24,510
like when,

4104
01:48:24,510 --> 01:48:26,640
when the garbage truck came a fight.

4105
01:48:26,641 --> 01:48:27,211
Like I was like,

4106
01:48:27,211 --> 01:48:28,044
fantastic.

4107
01:48:28,050 --> 01:48:28,861
Really sleep.

4108
01:48:28,861 --> 01:48:30,570
Good noise.

4109
01:48:30,630 --> 01:48:31,560
Where do you live in New York?

4110
01:48:31,710 --> 01:48:32,640
Uh,

4111
01:48:32,670 --> 01:48:33,240
well I,

4112
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:33,540
my,

4113
01:48:33,540 --> 01:48:38,160
my apartment my brother has now is in
Fort Greene on a Delphi between decal and

4114
01:48:38,161 --> 01:48:38,994
Lafayette.

4115
01:48:39,020 --> 01:48:39,750
Is that Brooklyn?

4116
01:48:39,750 --> 01:48:40,230
Yeah.

4117
01:48:40,230 --> 01:48:40,411
Yeah.

4118
01:48:40,411 --> 01:48:41,820
That's when my brother lives there now.

4119
01:48:41,850 --> 01:48:42,540
But um,

4120
01:48:42,540 --> 01:48:43,020
I don't,

4121
01:48:43,020 --> 01:48:43,950
I get to live in New York.

4122
01:48:44,340 --> 01:48:44,680
No,

4123
01:48:44,680 --> 01:48:45,600
that I live out here now.

4124
01:48:45,660 --> 01:48:46,240
Do you really?

4125
01:48:46,240 --> 01:48:46,590
Yeah.

4126
01:48:46,590 --> 01:48:47,520
How long you been here for?

4127
01:48:47,521 --> 01:48:48,354
Seven months.

4128
01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:49,353
We got to hang,

4129
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:51,740
we got to hang and we ain't
got to do a regular podcast.

4130
01:48:51,741 --> 01:48:53,910
And you're hilarious dude.

4131
01:48:54,390 --> 01:48:55,410
I love doing this.

4132
01:48:55,470 --> 01:48:56,730
I love you doing it man.

4133
01:48:56,840 --> 01:48:57,300
Yeah.

4134
01:48:57,300 --> 01:49:01,050
So do you like open the window up
out here to hear the horns and shit?

4135
01:49:01,080 --> 01:49:01,530
I leave.

4136
01:49:01,530 --> 01:49:02,251
I leave the window,

4137
01:49:02,251 --> 01:49:05,100
but I'm like the border
of Malibu Palisades soon.

4138
01:49:05,130 --> 01:49:06,450
Super Quiet.

4139
01:49:06,451 --> 01:49:06,751
Chill.

4140
01:49:06,751 --> 01:49:06,931
Yeah.

4141
01:49:06,931 --> 01:49:07,351
I just didn't,

4142
01:49:07,351 --> 01:49:08,910
he learned the leave the TV on.

4143
01:49:09,110 --> 01:49:09,590
Oh,

4144
01:49:09,590 --> 01:49:10,423
that's what he did.

4145
01:49:10,600 --> 01:49:11,340
He fall asleep.

4146
01:49:11,340 --> 01:49:12,420
That's so weird.

4147
01:49:12,870 --> 01:49:13,890
Have you always been like that?

4148
01:49:14,250 --> 01:49:14,521
Yeah.

4149
01:49:14,521 --> 01:49:14,881
You know,

4150
01:49:14,881 --> 01:49:15,271
I think,

4151
01:49:15,271 --> 01:49:19,020
cause my mom was always screaming and
yelling and fighting with my pops.

4152
01:49:19,110 --> 01:49:23,280
So it's like I went to bed with Connie
Corleone just breaking on the place.

4153
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:27,331
Wow,

4154
01:49:27,331 --> 01:49:28,470
that's interesting.

4155
01:49:28,580 --> 01:49:29,413
Yeah.

4156
01:49:29,460 --> 01:49:31,500
Well people are adaptable as fuck,

4157
01:49:31,501 --> 01:49:31,980
man.

4158
01:49:31,980 --> 01:49:32,830
People are like,

4159
01:49:32,850 --> 01:49:35,250
some people like they
cannot deal with the city.

4160
01:49:35,251 --> 01:49:38,100
They coming to cities start freaking
out and some people they freak out when

4161
01:49:38,101 --> 01:49:38,820
they go to the country.

4162
01:49:38,820 --> 01:49:39,660
They just don't like it.

4163
01:49:39,661 --> 01:49:40,980
And I'm like desensitized.

4164
01:49:41,310 --> 01:49:42,091
I'm totally dissed.

4165
01:49:42,091 --> 01:49:42,570
I've,

4166
01:49:42,570 --> 01:49:47,570
I've seen anything that you could possibly
throw be thrown and just my a maniac.

4167
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:48,903
That's hilarious.

4168
01:49:49,330 --> 01:49:50,230
They're still together though.

4169
01:49:50,270 --> 01:49:50,500
Yeah,

4170
01:49:50,500 --> 01:49:51,160
they're still together.

4171
01:49:51,160 --> 01:49:52,270
They still fight all the time.

4172
01:49:52,360 --> 01:49:52,930
Wow.

4173
01:49:52,930 --> 01:49:53,590
Yeah.

4174
01:49:53,590 --> 01:49:57,280
My grandparents fought so hard dude
that I thought that I would never get

4175
01:49:57,281 --> 01:49:57,701
married.

4176
01:49:57,701 --> 01:49:59,350
I thought I would never
have a relationship.

4177
01:49:59,380 --> 01:50:00,400
I my my,

4178
01:50:00,790 --> 01:50:05,200
like I had issues with relationships
based on not just my parents,

4179
01:50:05,230 --> 01:50:06,280
my mother and father.

4180
01:50:06,281 --> 01:50:06,430
My,

4181
01:50:06,430 --> 01:50:07,900
my actual father.

4182
01:50:07,930 --> 01:50:08,411
I grew up with,

4183
01:50:08,411 --> 01:50:09,850
my stepdad was a great guy,

4184
01:50:10,090 --> 01:50:13,210
but my actual dad was a
real fucking piece of shit.

4185
01:50:13,300 --> 01:50:13,540
Yeah.

4186
01:50:13,540 --> 01:50:15,070
And is very violent,

4187
01:50:15,071 --> 01:50:15,731
abusive.

4188
01:50:15,731 --> 01:50:17,380
And I saw a lot of domestic abuse.

4189
01:50:17,410 --> 01:50:18,100
Yeah.

4190
01:50:18,100 --> 01:50:18,791
Heard a lot.

4191
01:50:18,791 --> 01:50:21,760
But I saw some like dark
shit when I was a little kid.

4192
01:50:22,390 --> 01:50:23,620
And then my mom,

4193
01:50:23,650 --> 01:50:24,400
my grandma,

4194
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:25,121
my grandparents,

4195
01:50:25,121 --> 01:50:26,710
they didn't physically fine,

4196
01:50:26,890 --> 01:50:31,510
but they would fucking scream at each
other so hardcore that I would never want

4197
01:50:31,511 --> 01:50:32,321
to be in a relationship.

4198
01:50:32,321 --> 01:50:32,651
I was like,

4199
01:50:32,651 --> 01:50:35,620
fuck this man aiming at each other.

4200
01:50:35,870 --> 01:50:39,230
Parents physically fought and I,

4201
01:50:39,440 --> 01:50:42,740
I used to always reach for the phone and
call the cops and both of them we'd be

4202
01:50:42,741 --> 01:50:42,951
like,

4203
01:50:42,951 --> 01:50:43,730
don't do it.

4204
01:50:43,730 --> 01:50:44,180
And I was like,

4205
01:50:44,180 --> 01:50:44,541
wait,

4206
01:50:44,541 --> 01:50:47,300
the one thing you guys can agree
on is for me to not call the cops.

4207
01:50:48,170 --> 01:50:49,160
And they'd be like,

4208
01:50:49,161 --> 01:50:50,060
go upstairs,

4209
01:50:50,360 --> 01:50:51,430
hide your brothers.

4210
01:50:54,860 --> 01:50:58,670
And I would just like put my brothers
under the bed and then close the door.

4211
01:50:58,671 --> 01:51:00,950
And they were younger than me
cause I was the oldest thing,

4212
01:51:00,951 --> 01:51:01,731
what's going on.

4213
01:51:01,731 --> 01:51:03,050
And I had no answers for them,

4214
01:51:03,051 --> 01:51:03,350
man.

4215
01:51:03,350 --> 01:51:04,183
Wow.

4216
01:51:04,190 --> 01:51:05,120
I have no answer.

4217
01:51:05,180 --> 01:51:06,300
They were younger than you.

4218
01:51:06,301 --> 01:51:08,430
So you were the one that had to
make sense of it all to them.

4219
01:51:09,010 --> 01:51:09,843
It was rough.

4220
01:51:10,460 --> 01:51:14,580
It was rough on my sister was
a year younger than me when my,

4221
01:51:14,581 --> 01:51:15,060
uh,

4222
01:51:15,060 --> 01:51:18,600
mom and dad had like this
physical altercation that
made my mom move out of the

4223
01:51:18,601 --> 01:51:19,070
house.

4224
01:51:19,070 --> 01:51:19,350
Yeah.

4225
01:51:19,350 --> 01:51:22,380
My Dad smacked the shit on my mother
in front of the kitchen and my little

4226
01:51:22,381 --> 01:51:24,810
sister ran and hid and I hid and we were,

4227
01:51:25,050 --> 01:51:26,070
we were both freaked out,

4228
01:51:26,071 --> 01:51:27,450
but my sister just shut it out.

4229
01:51:27,451 --> 01:51:28,710
She doesn't even remember it.

4230
01:51:28,711 --> 01:51:29,580
She doesn't talk about it.

4231
01:51:29,610 --> 01:51:33,240
I can't forget it because
in my mind it was like,

4232
01:51:33,270 --> 01:51:33,571
okay,

4233
01:51:33,571 --> 01:51:36,120
now I know that my dad is a shithead.

4234
01:51:36,360 --> 01:51:40,050
Like I used to think that like he was
a hero and he was a great guy and you

4235
01:51:40,051 --> 01:51:40,180
know,

4236
01:51:40,180 --> 01:51:42,300
every body wants to think
their dad is superman.

4237
01:51:42,330 --> 01:51:42,690
Yeah.

4238
01:51:42,690 --> 01:51:42,890
You know,

4239
01:51:42,890 --> 01:51:43,080
when,

4240
01:51:43,080 --> 01:51:46,140
when it was undeniable
proof that he wasn't it,

4241
01:51:46,141 --> 01:51:47,190
fuck my head up,

4242
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:48,000
you know.

4243
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:49,560
But I only had my little sister,

4244
01:51:49,561 --> 01:51:50,970
she was only a year younger than me.

4245
01:51:51,630 --> 01:51:52,201
It wasn't like a,

4246
01:51:52,201 --> 01:51:53,640
how to like explain everything

4247
01:51:53,700 --> 01:51:55,350
that's my youngest brother is good with a,

4248
01:51:55,351 --> 01:51:56,430
he's well adjusted.

4249
01:51:56,460 --> 01:51:57,510
Me and my other,

4250
01:51:57,511 --> 01:51:58,560
my middle brother,

4251
01:51:58,740 --> 01:52:01,830
we've never really let it go.

4252
01:52:02,040 --> 01:52:05,490
It's like a part of us and I wished that
there was one parent that I could just

4253
01:52:05,491 --> 01:52:05,880
be like,

4254
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:07,410
they're the good one
and the other one's bad,

4255
01:52:07,620 --> 01:52:08,453
right.

4256
01:52:08,460 --> 01:52:12,120
My mom would like throw hot
water at my pops and I'd be like,

4257
01:52:12,121 --> 01:52:13,860
what the fuck is going on?

4258
01:52:14,820 --> 01:52:15,151
And then,

4259
01:52:15,151 --> 01:52:15,601
you know,

4260
01:52:15,601 --> 01:52:16,710
he would do his Dame,

4261
01:52:16,711 --> 01:52:17,880
I smack or whatever.

4262
01:52:17,881 --> 01:52:21,150
And then she tried to punch him and
then he'd hit her and I was just like,

4263
01:52:21,151 --> 01:52:23,370
this is WWF in the crib.

4264
01:52:23,430 --> 01:52:24,140
I got a friend who

4265
01:52:24,140 --> 01:52:27,580
still fights with his wife and his wife
threw a fucking screwdriver at him and

4266
01:52:27,581 --> 01:52:28,960
stuck him in the arm.

4267
01:52:28,961 --> 01:52:31,930
I get stuck out of his arm
and he fucked her that night.

4268
01:52:32,330 --> 01:52:32,650
He goes,

4269
01:52:32,650 --> 01:52:33,481
that shit turns me on.

4270
01:52:33,481 --> 01:52:33,701
And I go,

4271
01:52:33,701 --> 01:52:34,534
what?

4272
01:52:34,830 --> 01:52:35,231
And he goes,

4273
01:52:35,231 --> 01:52:35,771
one time,

4274
01:52:35,771 --> 01:52:36,190
man,

4275
01:52:36,190 --> 01:52:36,580
one time,

4276
01:52:36,580 --> 01:52:37,030
it will,

4277
01:52:37,030 --> 01:52:37,781
this is hilarious.

4278
01:52:37,781 --> 01:52:40,240
They were watching a
movie together and uh,

4279
01:52:40,270 --> 01:52:42,190
she fell asleep at the movie.

4280
01:52:42,340 --> 01:52:45,590
So he took his pants down and
it was there watching hundred.

4281
01:52:45,710 --> 01:52:46,040
He took

4282
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:49,790
his pants down and put his ass hole
like an inch away from her head.

4283
01:52:49,791 --> 01:52:51,410
And he goes and he yelled something.

4284
01:52:51,411 --> 01:52:53,360
She woke up and he
farted right in her face.

4285
01:52:55,970 --> 01:52:56,781
That's a new move.

4286
01:52:56,781 --> 01:52:57,770
That's the cornholio.

4287
01:52:59,330 --> 01:52:59,841
Oh man,

4288
01:52:59,841 --> 01:53:01,760
that's an easy fucking went crazy.

4289
01:53:01,761 --> 01:53:03,050
She punched him in the mouth.

4290
01:53:03,051 --> 01:53:03,920
She fucking freaky.

4291
01:53:03,921 --> 01:53:04,250
She goes,

4292
01:53:04,250 --> 01:53:04,581
he goes,

4293
01:53:04,581 --> 01:53:06,800
she fucking made me see stars.

4294
01:53:06,801 --> 01:53:09,670
Like she cracked me in
the job and he goes,

4295
01:53:09,680 --> 01:53:10,650
I fucking love it.

4296
01:53:10,680 --> 01:53:11,660
That shit turns me off.

4297
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:12,950
But that turns you on.

4298
01:53:13,120 --> 01:53:14,630
I know,

4299
01:53:14,660 --> 01:53:14,901
man.

4300
01:53:14,901 --> 01:53:16,430
When I saw this stuff with my parents,

4301
01:53:16,431 --> 01:53:16,940
I was just like,

4302
01:53:16,940 --> 01:53:19,280
I never want to be in a family like this.

4303
01:53:19,670 --> 01:53:20,150
Exactly.

4304
01:53:20,150 --> 01:53:21,530
I've always just dated.

4305
01:53:21,531 --> 01:53:22,370
Just Nice,

4306
01:53:22,371 --> 01:53:23,210
good people.

4307
01:53:23,240 --> 01:53:24,050
Yeah.

4308
01:53:24,050 --> 01:53:24,830
That's what I like.

4309
01:53:24,830 --> 01:53:25,370
I like,

4310
01:53:25,370 --> 01:53:27,410
I like people that are nice year.

4311
01:53:27,510 --> 01:53:28,050
Sweet.

4312
01:53:28,050 --> 01:53:28,290
Yeah.

4313
01:53:28,290 --> 01:53:29,123
Want no yelling?

4314
01:53:29,140 --> 01:53:29,331
No,

4315
01:53:29,331 --> 01:53:30,164
not in the island.

4316
01:53:30,290 --> 01:53:30,531
No.

4317
01:53:30,531 --> 01:53:31,610
I don't want to yell at my friends.

4318
01:53:31,610 --> 01:53:32,810
I don't want anybody yelling at me.

4319
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:34,760
That's the one thing I
looked for people as,

4320
01:53:34,770 --> 01:53:35,900
what do you look for when you hire people?

4321
01:53:35,990 --> 01:53:36,470
Good.

4322
01:53:36,470 --> 01:53:37,640
Trustworthy people.

4323
01:53:37,670 --> 01:53:38,503
Good values.

4324
01:53:38,510 --> 01:53:38,990
That's it.

4325
01:53:38,990 --> 01:53:39,620
You can't,

4326
01:53:39,620 --> 01:53:40,610
you can't teach that.

4327
01:53:40,611 --> 01:53:41,690
People have it or they don't.

4328
01:53:41,810 --> 01:53:42,200
Yeah,

4329
01:53:42,200 --> 01:53:44,270
and avoid people that you
can have disputes with.

4330
01:53:44,271 --> 01:53:44,540
Like,

4331
01:53:44,540 --> 01:53:45,890
maybe it's not them.

4332
01:53:45,950 --> 01:53:49,280
Maybe it's how you get along with
them that makes them the way they are,

4333
01:53:49,281 --> 01:53:50,720
but whatever the fuck it is,

4334
01:53:51,030 --> 01:53:53,780
just take the path of least resistance.

4335
01:53:53,950 --> 01:53:54,783
Yeah.

4336
01:53:54,890 --> 01:53:58,790
Cause the asteroids are fucking comment
come and even wasn't on the way.

4337
01:53:58,880 --> 01:53:59,870
All of the above.

4338
01:53:59,871 --> 01:54:00,860
Global warming.

4339
01:54:00,861 --> 01:54:01,880
Global Cooling.

4340
01:54:01,910 --> 01:54:02,330
Yeah.

4341
01:54:02,330 --> 01:54:03,141
This was fun though,

4342
01:54:03,141 --> 01:54:03,471
man.

4343
01:54:03,471 --> 01:54:03,601
Yeah.

4344
01:54:03,601 --> 01:54:04,350
I had a great time.

4345
01:54:04,350 --> 01:54:05,180
Fucking going to do it,

4346
01:54:05,180 --> 01:54:06,260
my friend more often.

4347
01:54:06,261 --> 01:54:06,870
Right around,

4348
01:54:06,870 --> 01:54:07,703
dude,

4349
01:54:08,630 --> 01:54:09,440
we got to hang.

4350
01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:10,340
And when does he show start?

4351
01:54:10,341 --> 01:54:11,061
February 4th.

4352
01:54:11,061 --> 01:54:14,210
February 4th February
4th fresh off the boat.

4353
01:54:14,240 --> 01:54:14,750
Anyone?

4354
01:54:14,750 --> 01:54:15,650
You're a bad mother fucker.

4355
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:16,011
Thank you.

4356
01:54:16,011 --> 01:54:16,281
Thank you,

4357
01:54:16,281 --> 01:54:16,580
sir.

4358
01:54:16,580 --> 01:54:17,080
I appreciate,

4359
01:54:17,080 --> 01:54:18,740

01:54:18,741 --> 01:54:19,790

Okay.
