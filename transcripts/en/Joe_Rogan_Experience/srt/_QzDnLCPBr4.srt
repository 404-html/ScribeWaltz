1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:02,440
The Joe Rogan experience.

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:05,040
What were you saying before the podcast
started?

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,470
You were gonna bring it up again about
veganism coming from a religion.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,850
Yeah.
Veganism started with the seventh

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,980
adventist church,
I believe.

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,240
So there was um,
a,

7
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,630
you know,
a group of people that had a church and

8
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,440
the guy that led the church as part of
the church was like,

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,020
you know,
they were following the Jewish kosher

10
00:00:25,021 --> 00:00:28,920
laws or whatever at first and it was
like no pigs or whatever else.

11
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:32,040
Shell fish,
I think pigs are shellfish and then the

12
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:34,950
guy just said like,
it just sort of took it to a next level

13
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:35,730
and said like,
no,

14
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,560
no meat,
no animal products at all.

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,550
And so these people that were in this
church were like the first real group of

16
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,180
vegans a church.
I've seventh adventist I think is what

17
00:00:45,181 --> 00:00:47,130
it's called is where it came from,
like 18,

18
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,100
63 is when that movement I guess started
everybody.

19
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,540
Sure.
I'd started early.

20
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,880
I'm sure people were doing it earlier
than that obviously,

21
00:00:53,881 --> 00:00:57,480
but I think that that's where the roots
came in and I just find that really

22
00:00:57,481 --> 00:00:59,400
interesting because it does,
you know,

23
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:01,170
it does seem like a religion,
it seems like,

24
00:01:01,171 --> 00:01:02,560
um,
they,

25
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,910
it seems like a lot of times you get,
um,

26
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:09,330
I get called out a lot on instagram and
stuff like that from people that are

27
00:01:09,331 --> 00:01:11,280
Vegan saying like,
I can't believe you'd do this and blah

28
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:12,780
blah,
but I would never go on their page and

29
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:15,280
say anything to them at all there

30
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:16,660
proselytizing.
I mean,

31
00:01:16,661 --> 00:01:18,160
that's,
that's a big part of this whole

32
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,200
community is,
it's,

33
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:22,810
there's the moral high ground they stand
on it and then a lot of these people,

34
00:01:22,811 --> 00:01:25,780
especially people with Vegan in their
name and their screen name,

35
00:01:25,781 --> 00:01:30,781
they always go after people that try to
shame people and what they're doing is

36
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:36,250
in many ways is a very good thing.
They're not participating factory

37
00:01:36,251 --> 00:01:37,150
farming,
right?

38
00:01:37,151 --> 00:01:40,570
They're not participating in the horrors
that we see these fucking peta videos

39
00:01:40,571 --> 00:01:44,110
where you see cows and pigs and
chickens.

40
00:01:44,111 --> 00:01:45,340
They're just being tortured.
All that.

41
00:01:45,341 --> 00:01:46,630
Fuck.
That is disgusting.

42
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:49,750
And that should be eliminated and it
shouldn't be a part of modern culture,

43
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:54,580
but in terms of like the humane raising
and killing of animals,

44
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,250
look,
they're not going to live forever and I

45
00:01:57,251 --> 00:01:59,950
don't care what you say.
I'm not into animal suffering.

46
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,290
I don't think they should suffer,
but if you try to say that people are

47
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:05,140
not herbivores or that people are
herbivores rather,

48
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,000
and then we're not omnivores,
you're crazy.

49
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,410
It's just not true.
It's not fact and they show pictures.

50
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,530
These are not the teeth of a carnivore.
These were not carnivores.

51
00:02:13,531 --> 00:02:14,980
Stupid.
We're omnivores.

52
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:19,720
Yeah.
We looked real similar in our teeth to

53
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:24,070
fucking chimps.
Chimps are omnivores and the human diet

54
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:27,400
is a very complex thing.
When you attach that human diet to

55
00:02:27,401 --> 00:02:29,080
ideology,
then it gets really,

56
00:02:29,081 --> 00:02:32,500
screw it because you're not dealing.
You're not dealing with people that are

57
00:02:32,501 --> 00:02:37,501
being honest about dietary,
like what is really important and for

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,780
dietary requirements,
how your body functions.

59
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,630
What the studies show.
If you look at it objectively,

60
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,750
the objective,
the first thing anybody should say first

61
00:02:46,751 --> 00:02:49,390
thing across the board,
get rid all the fucking sugar.

62
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,460
That's number one.
Get rid of all the refined

63
00:02:51,461 --> 00:02:53,980
carbohydrates,
eat more vegetables.

64
00:02:53,981 --> 00:02:56,590
I think you guys don't eat more
vegetables.

65
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,490
Eat healthy fats.
Get some form omega fatty acids.

66
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:05,170
Recognize that the omega fatty acids
that you get from flax seed oil or not

67
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:10,120
as bioavailable is fact from studies not
as bioavailable.

68
00:03:10,121 --> 00:03:11,860
Is it?
Mega fatty acids you get from fish and

69
00:03:11,861 --> 00:03:13,900
meat,
they're just not the meat.

70
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:14,711
The protein,
you say,

71
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:18,610
well broadly has 15 groups,
not as bioavailable.

72
00:03:18,611 --> 00:03:20,770
You fucks and you know it's not.
It's just not.

73
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:24,940
Yeah,
so you can get bioavailable protein from

74
00:03:24,941 --> 00:03:26,290
plants.
You get it from him.

75
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,840
You get it from Keenwah,
you get it from peas.

76
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,010
PEA proteins.
Very good.

77
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:34,270
But it's not as good as the protein that
you get from meat.

78
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,960
It's just not.
That's a high right,

79
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:40,820
but no.
You never saw 100 beck from the bottom

80
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,380
right,
like lower back.

81
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:47,410
We can make that like a lumbar pad.
Work as a lumberjack.

82
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:49,920
Yeah.
Yeah.

83
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,810
Sleeps all night and he works all day.
Like if,

84
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,320
if you look at Roy Nelson,
he's like the size of a really good

85
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:58,850
middleweight yeah,
no,

86
00:03:58,851 --> 00:03:59,330
he is.

87
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:00,350
Yeah.
But meanwhile,

88
00:04:00,351 --> 00:04:02,600
the guy knocked out,
Chuck Congo,

89
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,370
knocked out,
Brendan Schaub,

90
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,590
knocked out some big fucking
heavyweights,

91
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:10,880
knocked out Mitrione.
I mean fucking isn't announced and

92
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:13,740
knocked out.
A lot of people actually have.

93
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,350
They'll show.
Did he knock out?

94
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,750
I think I do not remember that fight.
Oh.

95
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,600
Um.
And it was the worst thing is it's with

96
00:04:23,601 --> 00:04:26,180
his right hand.
So you would think that people go to the

97
00:04:26,181 --> 00:04:27,770
hill to left up.
Yeah.

98
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:30,490
But somehow he connect anyway.
It's like,

99
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,070
you know what's going to happen?
We can stop it now.

100
00:04:34,071 --> 00:04:35,710
Almost knocked out over him.
Remember that?

101
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:36,540
Yeah.
Yeah.

102
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,730
He heard over him.
Yup.

103
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:42,110
Stephen's true.
Jesus Christ crazy.

104
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,790
I mean Roy is like six feet tall.
Stephan struve seven feet tall.

105
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,120
Yeah.
I mean fucking animal is an animal.

106
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,880
And I honestly,
I mean look at his gut right there.

107
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,670
How much is that?
It weighs about 2:50,

108
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:56,563
right?

109
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:57,891
He's,
he,

110
00:04:57,891 --> 00:05:02,891
I'm not bullshitting.
He is 50 pounds overweight and he's a

111
00:05:04,101 --> 00:05:06,140
world class athlete.
I mean,

112
00:05:06,141 --> 00:05:09,050
you cannot say that Roy Nelson is on a
world class fighter.

113
00:05:09,051 --> 00:05:12,920
You just know a world class fighter and
he's 50 pounds overweight.

114
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,220
So you dropped down 50 pounds,
now you're 200 pounds,

115
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,050
you make 85,
you cut weight,

116
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,530
everybody does that cut 15 pounds or 85
year old world champion.

117
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,900
You know,
there's no butter bean.

118
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,220
You know,
we were somewhere,

119
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,590
uh,
and the lead commissioner told me from

120
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:31,400
all the boxes on the card,
he had actually the best blood pressure

121
00:05:31,401 --> 00:05:36,401
and cholesterol.
He said we weren't a shock that the guy

122
00:05:36,651 --> 00:05:39,560
is in phenomenal shape.
That's what they told us.

123
00:05:39,561 --> 00:05:40,970
Yeah.
That's insane.

124
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,690
Butter being made.
Him Look like Rodriguez.

125
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,980
Look at him.
Jesus Christ.

126
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,000
Actually,
he looks good.

127
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,720
His whole family.
He looks exactly like that.

128
00:05:50,721 --> 00:05:52,550
I hear go upper right hand corner.
Yeah,

129
00:05:52,551 --> 00:05:54,110
that's what he looked like when he was
at its worse.

130
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:58,010
Meanwhile he's another guy knocked dudes
dead man.

131
00:05:58,011 --> 00:06:00,110
He is so funny at such a good time with
him.

132
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:03,110
And there was a prince George in
Kennedy.

133
00:06:03,111 --> 00:06:04,310
He was there.
He's a player.

134
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,800
That's hilarious.
Very funny guy.

135
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,990
That's funny.
You know,

136
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:16,190
he's a fucking hell of a cook apparently
you can't tell,

137
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:20,570
but it's like there's food watching a
video of butter beans cooking some ribs.

138
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,070
And I was like,
damn,

139
00:06:22,071 --> 00:06:23,720
that looks legit.
Like yes.

140
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,580
Smoker.
Who's cooking them in a smoker?

141
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,800
He broke the rule though.
Don't get high if your own supply.

142
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,700
Jamie was watching the video of soccer
Berg.

143
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:35,480
How did it go?
He should know the answer is

144
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:41,470
he dad had to go again today and uh,
I was watching right before you got here

145
00:06:41,471 --> 00:06:43,090
in this,
I don't know where she was from,

146
00:06:43,091 --> 00:06:45,340
but she was saying like,
you're the CEO of this company and you

147
00:06:45,341 --> 00:06:47,020
should know some of these answers.
And she was like,

148
00:06:47,021 --> 00:06:49,720
listing all the shitty.
Didn't know it was like this is

149
00:06:49,721 --> 00:06:51,250
ridiculous.
And then I afterwards,

150
00:06:51,251 --> 00:06:53,730
now they've shown,
which I guess it's part of nonpublic

151
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,030
information,
has notes.

152
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,640
Oh no,
that he had like as references that he

153
00:06:57,641 --> 00:06:59,350
was looking at.
I've only seen one picture of it.

154
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:03,010
Just very weird stuff that like,
seems blatantly obvious that he should

155
00:07:03,011 --> 00:07:05,710
know or should say that's different from
what we've.

156
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,130
Maybe we think we should.
Yeah,

157
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,160
I think they should be able to.

158
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,700
Fellas,
I get the impression that this company

159
00:07:10,701 --> 00:07:13,430
grew so fast,
they don't even know what the fuck is

160
00:07:13,431 --> 00:07:14,480
going on in now.
Well,

161
00:07:14,481 --> 00:07:17,540
that was the other thing he was talking
about their influence on possible.

162
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,760
Are we going to continue?
Will continue,

163
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:20,690
don't worry about that.
Um,

164
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:24,890
he was talking about his influence on
all these different upcoming elections

165
00:07:24,891 --> 00:07:27,830
that were coming up and about how they
wanted to make sure that there was no

166
00:07:27,831 --> 00:07:30,530
bots that were influencing these
elections.

167
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,210
And I stopped and thought about it and
I'm like,

168
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,700
oh my God.
In that moment of him saying that,

169
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:37,310
I realized like what pressure he must be
under,

170
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,990
what pressure that companies under
there.

171
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,920
They went from being a thing where
people could share pictures like of,

172
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,740
Hey,
this isn't our summer vacation.

173
00:07:44,741 --> 00:07:45,511
And like,
Hey,

174
00:07:45,511 --> 00:07:47,330
you know,
fucking we're going to go to the pub on

175
00:07:47,331 --> 00:07:49,730
Friday.
That's what facebook kind of was,

176
00:07:49,731 --> 00:07:52,040
right?
People would talk about certain things

177
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,780
in the news.
They would have opinions.

178
00:07:53,781 --> 00:07:55,790
You put up something,
a bunch of people comment on it.

179
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:00,940
That's what it was.
Now with this last election and with him

180
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:06,800
testifying in front of Congress,
what I'm seeing is facebook being like

181
00:08:06,801 --> 00:08:11,801
one of the most important sources of
influence in the world today,

182
00:08:12,621 --> 00:08:16,760
and it's not really being completely
managed.

183
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,220
Oh,
oh,

184
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,280
awesome.
You're like the Russians,

185
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,121
the Russians.
Yeah.

186
00:08:22,121 --> 00:08:25,660
Maybe there's a little bit like Google
needs to be looked into.

187
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:29,320
What was going on with my mic?
So Google also probably like they have a

188
00:08:29,321 --> 00:08:31,780
data.
I think someone was just looking into

189
00:08:31,781 --> 00:08:32,200
this,
you know,

190
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,330
people downloaded their facebook profile
and they're like,

191
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,970
my files one gigabyte.
Well,

192
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,770
how much data is in here?
People found out a way to download

193
00:08:38,771 --> 00:08:40,270
theirs and find their information and
what,

194
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,510
what does facebook know about me?
Apparently there's also one that Google

195
00:08:43,511 --> 00:08:46,670
has on everyone and it's much larger to
the busy.

196
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:50,730
Ah,
Ooh.

197
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,540
I'm not shocked.
I don't know.

198
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:54,060
There's,
there's.

199
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,280
And here's the thing that it an endless
cycle.

200
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,920
Yeah.
I mean we just don't have that next

201
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,950
unacceptable word,
right.

202
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,910
You know,
like everybody knows.

203
00:09:02,911 --> 00:09:07,710
I think a lot of people know that as far
as somebody who's a doesn't have is

204
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:12,690
developmentally disabled.
Retarded was kind of the latest term

205
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,330
that was once acceptable.
It's clearly not now.

206
00:09:15,331 --> 00:09:17,940
I mean that is kind of the point,
but before that,

207
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:20,870
you know,
moron was a medical term wasn't.

208
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,340
Yeah,
mongoloid idiot was what they used to

209
00:09:23,341 --> 00:09:27,350
call 'em down syndrome children.
That was like 100 years ago.

210
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,010
Yeah,
it was on the birth certificate.

211
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,910
Right.
But I'm saying,

212
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,730
you know,
people who are saying,

213
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,730
you know,
just to stop saying they're not wrong,

214
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:40,200
that you know,
but there is also another word down the

215
00:09:40,201 --> 00:09:40,891
pipeline,
right.

216
00:09:40,891 --> 00:09:45,330
There's something else that's coming
that's going to be a medical word or

217
00:09:45,331 --> 00:09:47,730
term and then that'll be used to insult
people,

218
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:50,250
but that's the way people use language.

219
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:55,250
Like once we identify this is the word
people use to label someone with a

220
00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:00,930
developmental disability,
people in the slang will grow from that.

221
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,570
People will start using that.
Well,

222
00:10:03,571 --> 00:10:07,710
what's interesting to me is that when
we're talking about words,

223
00:10:07,711 --> 00:10:09,600
you're not going to change the way
people think.

224
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,310
So words are supposed to convey.
Intent is supposed to be sounds that we

225
00:10:14,311 --> 00:10:19,110
all agree mean a certain thing and the
more depth,

226
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:23,910
the more access towards you have,
the more you can sort of flavor your

227
00:10:23,911 --> 00:10:25,470
conversation.
So I understand what you're saying.

228
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,010
Like if you're saying this guy,
I kinda get it,

229
00:10:29,011 --> 00:10:31,530
but you feel like this fucking guy.
I'm like,

230
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:33,200
well Tom is really mad.
You know what I mean?

231
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,140
That and to take that out.
Yeah.

232
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:40,430
It's like I don't know.
So sometimes you take those things out

233
00:10:40,651 --> 00:10:42,780
when you're like on a television show or
something like that,

234
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,670
but all television shows because of that
all censored television shows only

235
00:10:47,671 --> 00:10:50,700
exists within a certain band.
Yes.

236
00:10:50,701 --> 00:10:52,800
A certain frequency.
They never get out of that.

237
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,020
Like the Joey Diaz frequency is like,
ah,

238
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:57,420
there's no fucking roof.
There's no fence.

239
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,233
True.
This,

240
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:03,930
this frequency that you get on like late
night talk shows or sitcoms,

241
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:09,170
this very narrow band that,
that there's no contact in that band.

242
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,340
There's no,
you motherfucker this.

243
00:11:11,341 --> 00:11:13,970
All those things are not in there.
Which is what you're all about.

244
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,080
I feel like whenever you're.
For me,

245
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:19,230
when I'm watching something like that,
part of my brain's always like,

246
00:11:19,231 --> 00:11:22,140
go find a motherfucker somewhere.
You kind of want it.
