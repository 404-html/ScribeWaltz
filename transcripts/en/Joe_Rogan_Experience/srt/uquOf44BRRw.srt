1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,051
Try My day,

2
00:00:01,051 --> 00:00:03,720
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:04,681
I mean you're,

4
00:00:04,681 --> 00:00:08,300
you're seeing all these new
approaches constantly changing.

5
00:00:08,301 --> 00:00:09,540
So many great minds involved.

6
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:10,320
Yeah,

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,051
that's what I liked.

8
00:00:11,051 --> 00:00:14,140
I mean fear us a hobby and I
meet them on the list can go on,

9
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:14,910
but that's what,

10
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:15,360
to me,

11
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,650
that's what I've become now a bit of
more of a nerd because you call somebody

12
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:19,440
fights and you,

13
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,760
you try to have a life as well,

14
00:00:20,761 --> 00:00:22,350
but I'm really now getting back into,

15
00:00:22,351 --> 00:00:22,770
okay,

16
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,230
let's catch up and see what
these different minds are saying.

17
00:00:25,231 --> 00:00:26,310
Well you yourself sir,

18
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:27,150
even you know,

19
00:00:27,151 --> 00:00:27,931
listening to this,

20
00:00:27,931 --> 00:00:31,620
it's just always so cool to hear
different perspectives and okay,

21
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:32,693
what's going to work.

22
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:34,800
It's super important for all of us.

23
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,630
I think that's why Bj's going to do good.

24
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:37,321
It really,

25
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:40,830
I truly believe because he changed cab.

26
00:00:40,831 --> 00:00:42,060
I think talent,

27
00:00:42,061 --> 00:00:44,520
like Bj in his training in Hawaii,

28
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,061
you know,

29
00:00:45,061 --> 00:00:46,800
he kind of dictates
whatever he wants to do.

30
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:47,670
He's so talented.

31
00:00:47,671 --> 00:00:48,660
He schools people around.

32
00:00:48,661 --> 00:00:50,550
And that's why when you put
people like that on a pressure,

33
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,060
they get tired because they
never experienced that in
the ring because he's so

34
00:00:54,061 --> 00:00:55,470
way ahead above of everybody else.

35
00:00:55,471 --> 00:00:58,680
So if they want to do extra three rounds
with them and he doesn't want to do it,

36
00:00:58,681 --> 00:00:59,370
he's going to have,

37
00:00:59,370 --> 00:00:59,951
I'm not going to do it.

38
00:00:59,951 --> 00:01:02,360
I think that's a batch of
that trick at Greg Winkle.

39
00:01:02,361 --> 00:01:02,940
John,

40
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:03,241
you know,

41
00:01:03,241 --> 00:01:05,040
and there he's got all
these guys gunning for him.

42
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:05,641
It's a legend.

43
00:01:05,641 --> 00:01:06,390
I mean I'm,

44
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,430
I can only imagine the sparring
sessions they have going on.

45
00:01:08,431 --> 00:01:09,960
I think it's going to
do really well for him.

46
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:10,980
It's opponent.

47
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:11,521
Yeah.

48
00:01:11,521 --> 00:01:12,570
Rodriguez is really good.

49
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:13,220
Okay.

50
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,480
But I think the whole,

51
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:15,991
honestly,

52
00:01:15,991 --> 00:01:16,590
I mean the,

53
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,490
he's a hall of Famer,

54
00:01:17,491 --> 00:01:20,070
done everything of w we
saw against Frankie Edgar.

55
00:01:20,071 --> 00:01:20,580
What does it,

56
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,110
we talked about our podcast the last,

57
00:01:22,111 --> 00:01:23,070
when was Matt Hughes?

58
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,460
2010 do you,

59
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,130
why do you think he's still fighting?

60
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:26,731
Well,

61
00:01:26,731 --> 00:01:28,950
he probably feels like
he didn't do it right.

62
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,860
He probably feels like the
fights he took with Frankie.

63
00:01:31,861 --> 00:01:36,370
We had that really bizarre standups
stance was that was the weirdest thing guy

64
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,111
I've ever seen.

65
00:01:37,111 --> 00:01:40,380
He decided that he was gonna fight that
way because it was more efficient and it

66
00:01:40,381 --> 00:01:43,260
didn't use as much energy
as like widening his stance.

67
00:01:43,261 --> 00:01:43,981
And He,

68
00:01:43,981 --> 00:01:48,981
I think a lot of his career
he was concerned with losing
his energy in the ring.

69
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:49,620
Yup.

70
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,311
A lot of his crew,

71
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:51,570
he's worried about gassing him.

72
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,190
So then he went with Mark Marinovich.

73
00:01:53,191 --> 00:01:53,461
Right.

74
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:57,000
So he does these two camps with Marvin
or intervention at least two camps.

75
00:01:57,001 --> 00:01:57,450
Correct?

76
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,970
He did Sean Sherk and I
think he did Diego Sanchez.

77
00:01:59,971 --> 00:02:00,391
I know he did.

78
00:02:00,391 --> 00:02:01,230
Diego Sanchez.

79
00:02:01,231 --> 00:02:05,400
Yeah cause I know also that Steve Maxwell
was training Diego Sanchez got Sanchez

80
00:02:05,401 --> 00:02:06,490
and incredible shame.

81
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:11,190
But that was Bj in his prime and when
Bj wasn't tired when he was in shape and

82
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,630
he was joking around about it.

83
00:02:12,631 --> 00:02:13,680
Like when I have a six pack,

84
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,110
oh my aunt took him know what was it?

85
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,390
He wasn't just a different
animal back then,

86
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,300
but it was only sustainable
for like a few fights.

87
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,410
I think like Bj,

88
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,320
it's for whatever reason,

89
00:02:25,321 --> 00:02:29,280
it was hard for him to get totally
motivated to get into that kind of shape

90
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:29,731
again.

91
00:02:29,731 --> 00:02:30,350
And you know,

92
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,111
when he described it,

93
00:02:31,111 --> 00:02:33,720
it sounded helacious like he
couldn't hold his daughter literally,

94
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:37,710
literally so tired after working out
that he couldn't even hold his kid.

95
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,700
And they have a very specific training
philosophy to the Marinovich is,

96
00:02:41,701 --> 00:02:42,270
and uh,

97
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,410
in a lot of ways,

98
00:02:43,411 --> 00:02:44,010
um,

99
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:44,400
uh,

100
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,360
some of the guys that,

101
00:02:45,361 --> 00:02:45,510
uh,

102
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:49,500
like nick curse on who trains under
his philosophy and a speed of sport in

103
00:02:49,501 --> 00:02:50,334
California,

104
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,090
they want strength and conditioning
to be number one priority number one,

105
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:54,980
you already know how to fight.

106
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,853
I love that.

107
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:56,281
Yeah.

108
00:02:56,281 --> 00:02:57,900
And the idea is that you
already know how to find,

109
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,650
so since [inaudible] how to fight,

110
00:02:59,651 --> 00:03:04,090
you should just work on having the most
incredible aerobic threshold that goes

111
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:07,930
back to frank and a plan to Ortiz.

112
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,430
Well,

113
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:08,680
yeah,

114
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,070
but even Franco with the,

115
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,140
why am I going to Kip Maury Smith with
a node deck partner show you at the

116
00:03:14,141 --> 00:03:14,501
beginning,

117
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:16,310
that's what frank was all about was the,

118
00:03:16,311 --> 00:03:17,200
the couldn't be cardio.

119
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:20,120
Cardio was on the bus back.

120
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:20,690
Uh,

121
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,450
when Tito loss to frank,

122
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:25,200
I was in the same bus going
back to the airport at Tito,

123
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,450
jump next to me and he starts asking me
question about stamina because I always

124
00:03:28,451 --> 00:03:31,480
said is the most important thing
you can never have enough stamina.

125
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:31,810
Right.

126
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,210
The most important that you start asking
drills and doing the all these things.

127
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,530
And then he became debt.

128
00:03:35,531 --> 00:03:37,210
Crazy cycle,

129
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:37,571
cardio,

130
00:03:37,571 --> 00:03:38,380
cardio,

131
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:38,680
you know.

132
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,790
And he started beating everybody,

133
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,633
showing me,

134
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,900
transferred that to Kendall Grove and
trained under the ultimate fighter when

135
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,090
Kendell came out of that show.

136
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:46,960
And that's what he told me.

137
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:47,231
He's like,

138
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:48,160
it's all cardio man.

139
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:50,650
Everything is about cardio and but again,

140
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:52,090
cardio also.

141
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,790
What about the nerves then in
how much panicking and your,

142
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:56,890
your emotions drained?

143
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,840
Like what I'm saying is a factor in it,

144
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:03,040
but the actual real cold hard
cardio plays a factor too.

145
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:03,340
Right.

146
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,960
And it also plays a factor in your nerves.

147
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:05,200
Yeah.

148
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,430
Because if you know that you have a small
gas tank and they started to give it

149
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:08,720
up.

150
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,340
Yeah.

151
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,050
And especially when you walk to the ring.

152
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:12,220
Did I train hard enough?

153
00:04:12,221 --> 00:04:12,441
You know,

154
00:04:12,441 --> 00:04:14,320
cause you know that you can really go,

155
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:14,860
you know,

156
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,710
after work I done,

157
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:16,391
we'll do seven,

158
00:04:16,391 --> 00:04:17,260
six minutes round.

159
00:04:17,261 --> 00:04:18,910
So the type at full blast,

160
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,500
that's like 42 minutes.

161
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:20,950
Wow.

162
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:21,330
Uh,

163
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:22,870
and but that was after a workout.

164
00:04:22,871 --> 00:04:24,340
But I knew that nobody did that.

165
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,960
So I was not going to run out against,

166
00:04:25,961 --> 00:04:27,370
because we had half our fights in the,

167
00:04:27,371 --> 00:04:28,180
in Japan.

168
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,760
But it's the only way to do it.

169
00:04:29,761 --> 00:04:30,670
Chances are they go hard.

170
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,690
And I had guys coming who couldn't
do the warmup in my class.

171
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:37,190
This is a 20 minute warmup is the boss
where workout with the sprawls and in a

172
00:04:37,191 --> 00:04:37,930
minutes we built,

173
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:41,110
I fill them up with the IDA pushups
or with the Kettlebell swings.

174
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,340
So it's 20 minutes straight.

175
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:46,300
People come in who had a fight like in
two weeks in Japan and he couldn't do it.

176
00:04:46,301 --> 00:04:46,931
They had dead man.

177
00:04:46,931 --> 00:04:47,201
I said,

178
00:04:47,201 --> 00:04:47,770
don't fight.

179
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:47,951
He said,

180
00:04:47,951 --> 00:04:48,311
what do you mean?

181
00:04:48,311 --> 00:04:48,551
I said,

182
00:04:48,551 --> 00:04:49,240
this is the warmup.

183
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,020
We didn't even start now and neutral.

184
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:53,620
So say they lost because
of cardio over there,

185
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:54,760
but he's not shy.

186
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:55,650
But how do you do this?

187
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:55,901
I said,

188
00:04:55,901 --> 00:04:56,681
it's just baby steps.

189
00:04:56,681 --> 00:05:00,130
It is just get yourself to the point
where you can get through that entire warm

190
00:05:00,131 --> 00:05:00,401
up,

191
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:01,970
full clip and then just get,

192
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:02,921
yeah,

193
00:05:02,921 --> 00:05:03,591
just keep doing it.

194
00:05:03,591 --> 00:05:04,424
Yeah.

195
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,153
Okay.

196
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:13,470
Okay.
