1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:00,843
The phone calls.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:03,773
Nothing to hide.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,313
Yeah.

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,570
And we're live ladies and gentlemen.

5
00:00:08,571 --> 00:00:10,100
So just like that,

6
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,050
just like that bitch is,

7
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:17,200
I get a message from a friend of mine
who says that while he was listening to

8
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:18,620
the show,

9
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,950
we were talking about something and then
the ads for that thing started showing

10
00:00:24,621 --> 00:00:25,454
up.

11
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:26,360
Yeah.

12
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:26,810
Oh God.

13
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:27,410
It's a,

14
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,570
it's Fong from my plastic cell.

15
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,470
He said you guys were talking about
slouching with the avant today and this

16
00:00:33,471 --> 00:00:35,090
popped up on his feet just now.

17
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,530
I never googled it before.

18
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,170
And it's some fucking alarm that goes off.

19
00:00:39,171 --> 00:00:40,400
Like when you slouch forward,

20
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:41,080
have you seen those things?

21
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:41,850
You glue them on you.

22
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,130
I've been getting an ad for that too.

23
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:43,671
Oh,

24
00:00:43,671 --> 00:00:46,430
you have as random
coincidence could be that.

25
00:00:46,431 --> 00:00:51,350
Or it could be targeting Joe Rogan
listeners do the way it works.

26
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,970
So they found out that
we were listening to,

27
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:54,741
they could just be going,

28
00:00:54,741 --> 00:00:55,670
I mean maybe that,

29
00:00:55,671 --> 00:00:58,670
but like there's a large audience here
so they could just be going after like,

30
00:00:58,830 --> 00:00:59,360
oh right.

31
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,820
But do you think like what?

32
00:01:00,821 --> 00:01:01,371
Adam Green,

33
00:01:01,371 --> 00:01:04,070
she said the other day that that's
happening again talking about,

34
00:01:04,071 --> 00:01:07,520
he was talking about Toyota trucks and
then all of a sudden it's Google ads

35
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:08,630
started showing up.

36
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,660
Toyota Tacomas and he,

37
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:11,421
and he was like,

38
00:01:11,421 --> 00:01:11,780
dude,

39
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,201
he goes,

40
00:01:12,201 --> 00:01:13,850
they're listening and
the robots are listening.

41
00:01:13,851 --> 00:01:14,720
So one's listening,

42
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,360
but they're also looking for like
key terms and stuff like that.

43
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:21,560
But they're listening to your phone as
you're having a conversation you think?

44
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:22,423
Yes,

45
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,320
I have a few instances.

46
00:01:24,321 --> 00:01:25,520
I took screenshots because I was,

47
00:01:25,521 --> 00:01:26,140
it was happening.

48
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:26,973
It happened three,

49
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:28,130
three consecutive weeks.

50
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,510
I touched something.

51
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,100
I literally like held the object in my
hand and within 12 hours I was getting an

52
00:01:34,101 --> 00:01:34,640
ad for it.

53
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,630
Maybe your magic bro.

54
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,860
It's very strange.

55
00:01:36,861 --> 00:01:38,760
One of them I have with [inaudible] Bravo,

56
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:40,291
they're so weird.

57
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:40,551
It was like,

58
00:01:40,551 --> 00:01:42,920
how the fuck am I getting
an ad for this thing now?

59
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:44,300
I've never even seen this.

60
00:01:44,301 --> 00:01:45,680
I've never talked about it to anybody.

61
00:01:45,681 --> 00:01:46,820
I didn't tell anybody I was holding it.

62
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:47,181
Yeah,

63
00:01:47,181 --> 00:01:48,014
you got look for it.

64
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:52,700
Always be careful of like this idea that,

65
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:53,031
you know,

66
00:01:53,031 --> 00:01:57,260
because sometimes things
are just a coincidence and
this idea that there's some

67
00:01:57,261 --> 00:02:00,290
grand conspiracy when it could be
easily explained by coincidence,

68
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,880
but the thing that Adam said,

69
00:02:01,881 --> 00:02:02,240
he said it,

70
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:02,810
he goes,

71
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:03,290
man,

72
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,050
I never fucking Google Toyota trucks.

73
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:06,651
Is that a good,

74
00:02:06,651 --> 00:02:07,170
uh,

75
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,780
I was trying to get that really not bad.

76
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:09,400
Not that good.

77
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,233
A little British.

78
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,083
Hey Mike.

79
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:11,960
Um,

80
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,670
but he was saying that uh,

81
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,910
they start popping up right
after the podcast immediately.

82
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,770
So if that's the case,

83
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:22,610
they had to be listening to his podcast
or they are listed one of them's list

84
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:24,290
because you have a large audience,

85
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:28,370
someone from those listened to it
live and then they're just like,

86
00:02:28,371 --> 00:02:29,090
dude,

87
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,680
they launched those ads.

88
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:30,951
Yeah,

89
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:32,690
but it has to get on his Google feed.

90
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,313
Yeah.

91
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:39,110
You think they spoil more
fucking crime and stuff?

92
00:02:39,111 --> 00:02:39,944
If they're listening,

93
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,990
you don't make money spoiling crying,

94
00:02:41,991 --> 00:02:42,760
Bro.

95
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,380
I'm like,

96
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:43,900
Eh,

97
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,290
make money selling trucks.

98
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,181
I don't know.

99
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:48,890
I mean,

100
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:52,670
I feel like for sure when I Google
something and starts popping up,

101
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,361
we know that,

102
00:02:53,361 --> 00:02:54,350
but that seems normal.

103
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:54,600
All,

104
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,240
dude,

105
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,300
if you go on my phone right now,

106
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,890
because I've been looking at dodge vipers,

107
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,030
it anything I clicked on,

108
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,093
vipers pop up.

109
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,510
Even ads on Instagram.

110
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:02,290
Real.

111
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,123
Yeah.

112
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,310
They're just trying to get you to like,

113
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,910
when I look at houses in a certain house,

114
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,160
markets pop up.

115
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,150
It's weird.

116
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:10,810
They know.

117
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:11,230
They know.

118
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,700
Mother fuckers look at
to spend some money.

119
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:13,240
Yeah.

120
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,310
Speaking and spend some money forward.

121
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:16,990
Why do you hate America?

122
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,950
They released the new gt
500 only an automatic.

123
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,240
Oh my God.

124
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:23,320
What a shame.

125
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,600
What shame is it only automatic?

126
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:26,590
Only automatic.

127
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,011
I didn't know that.

128
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:28,750
I posted on my story
because some dude was like,

129
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:29,960
shop when you get one of these.

130
00:03:29,961 --> 00:03:30,251
And I was like,

131
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:30,491
God,

132
00:03:30,491 --> 00:03:31,600
that thing is dope.

133
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,700
And I posted with like a thinking face.

134
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,770
None of that's automatic ain't happening.

135
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,271
People go,

136
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:39,490
well you have a PDK gt three Rs.

137
00:03:39,491 --> 00:03:40,500
It's deaf Fred.

138
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,171
Well it's also,

139
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:42,490
that's the only way they make it.

140
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,191
Well,

141
00:03:43,191 --> 00:03:44,920
he's usually the way they
make the gt three Rs.

142
00:03:44,921 --> 00:03:45,491
The RS.

143
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:45,880
Yeah.

144
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,090
I mean you could get a gt three or are I,

145
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:49,810
you know,

146
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:50,590
I get it.

147
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,020
People don't want to shift.

148
00:03:52,021 --> 00:03:53,170
It gets stuck in traffic.

149
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,830
I get it.

150
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:57,730
But there's a lot of other cars
and get the GT 500 the whole,

151
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,060
it used to only be stick
like the gt three 50.

152
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,430
Well you know why they're doing it
because they want to compete with everyone

153
00:04:03,431 --> 00:04:03,550
else.

154
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:08,160
Cause on the track the PDK is beat the
best racers in the world know like uh,

155
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,710
my brother's telling me about this uh,

156
00:04:09,711 --> 00:04:11,730
article he was reading where I,

157
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,571
I think it was the,

158
00:04:12,571 --> 00:04:15,640
the new gt three Rs and um,

159
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:16,740
or maybe was the,

160
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,820
it was the new gt three
cause there's one in PDK,

161
00:04:18,821 --> 00:04:19,750
there's one in stick,

162
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,890
one of the best race car drivers in
the world driving the stick shift.

163
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,090
Then they had some average
dumb ass driving the PDK
and they're going around the

164
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:29,470
track and the PDK smoke.

165
00:04:29,471 --> 00:04:30,250
This dude,

166
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,690
the guy with a stick shift smoked him.

167
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:32,441
Yeah.

168
00:04:32,441 --> 00:04:36,400
But what are you trying to do if you'd
just trying to buy a car for the track?

169
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:36,941
I get it.

170
00:04:36,941 --> 00:04:38,950
But how many people are
buying a car for the track?

171
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:39,941
You're looking at him,

172
00:04:39,941 --> 00:04:40,690
Bro.

173
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,220
I race on the track and I don't,

174
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:42,940
I have no idea.

175
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,960
I don't give a shit.

176
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,270
I just liked the feeling.

177
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,380
Um,

178
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:47,811
and it's,

179
00:04:47,811 --> 00:04:50,440
it's kind of link cause
I have that slingshot,

180
00:04:50,441 --> 00:04:54,310
the polar slingshot and that stick shift
and that's like a tricky stick shift.

181
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,380
Well that's that little tiny cage.

182
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,120
Dang wheels dangerous as shit.

183
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,560
But because the stick shift,

184
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,890
I like not being able to
pay attention to my phone.

185
00:05:02,891 --> 00:05:05,680
I like having to worry about
all the cars around me.

186
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:06,940
Like I liked that feeling.

187
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,020
I like the feeling of the road and
the stick shift and I dig that.

188
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,340
I want that in a car now.

189
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,180
Yeah.

190
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,250
I that,

191
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,240
that's how my corvette is.

192
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:17,231
My court,

193
00:05:17,231 --> 00:05:18,460
that little 65 corvette,

194
00:05:18,461 --> 00:05:19,660
that thing's so small.

195
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:20,381
Pumps some life.

196
00:05:20,381 --> 00:05:20,920
India though.

197
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,510
Oh God.

198
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,140
You drive it to the store all the time.

199
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:23,880
Yeah,

200
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,671
we shut right.

201
00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:24,851
Yeah.

202
00:05:24,851 --> 00:05:25,540
Wakes you up.

203
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,410
Well it's so loud.

204
00:05:26,411 --> 00:05:27,460
It's good side pipes.

205
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:28,621
It's a stick shift.

206
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:30,730
Big Old Hearst fucking
cue ball on the top.

207
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:32,650
That's what you want.

208
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,510
That's what they used
to have with a gt 500.

209
00:05:34,511 --> 00:05:38,260
I had a gt 500 way back
in 2012 that was glorious.

210
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,270
Big Old rumbly fucking,

211
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,710
I had a convertible to hell.

212
00:05:41,711 --> 00:05:42,100
Yeah.

213
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:42,581
Damn right.

214
00:05:42,581 --> 00:05:42,800
You know,

215
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,633
Blah Blah Blah.

216
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:44,440
It was great.

217
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,420
Put the top down loud as fuck.

218
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,230
But also we get,

219
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,700
we get too comfy with the,

220
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,091
with the,

221
00:05:49,091 --> 00:05:49,331
you know,

222
00:05:49,331 --> 00:05:49,950
if you have your,

223
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:53,290
you drive your fricking m five so
cushy and everything's kind of,

224
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,183
there it is.

225
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,140
I think it looks dope as shit.

226
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,410
Look at the front view,

227
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:57,921
the seat.

228
00:05:57,921 --> 00:05:59,780
Go with a silver gt.

229
00:05:59,781 --> 00:06:01,070
500 pull that up.

230
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,930
There's a shitload of
carbon fiber in it now.

231
00:06:02,931 --> 00:06:03,460
Yeah,

232
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,293
yeah,

233
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:05,721
yeah.

234
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:09,620
There's a bunch of shit like the
splitter and a bunch of the aero stuff.

235
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,330
They'll hit that one right there.

236
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,020
Look at that.

237
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,190
Oh,

238
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,990
that looks so healthy.

239
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,070
That looks so good.

240
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:16,521
I love it.

241
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:17,900
It's a goddamn automatic.

242
00:06:17,901 --> 00:06:19,070
Like why did they do that?

243
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,510
Like just to compete man.

244
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:23,750
So when you look on
motor trend as an option,

245
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:24,643
I agree.

246
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:24,861
I,

247
00:06:24,861 --> 00:06:25,970
but to have it as an option.

248
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:26,330
Yeah.

249
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:29,360
Having it as an option and they give
you a skirt when you climb into it.

250
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:32,150
It said the transmission was
made specifically for this car.

251
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:32,980
Yes.

252
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,450
Just to get performance out of it.

253
00:06:34,451 --> 00:06:35,840
That's all they want is the performance.

254
00:06:35,841 --> 00:06:36,411
So they can say,

255
00:06:36,411 --> 00:06:36,591
hey,

256
00:06:36,591 --> 00:06:37,760
this competes with,

257
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,810
you know,

258
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:41,150
I would still drive that even
though it's an automatic oh,

259
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,380
driving as a daily driver.

260
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:43,940
Yeah,

261
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:44,480
I agree.

262
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,340
I would 750 horsepower
dailies at seven 57 it says.

263
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:48,711
Oh it is.

264
00:06:48,711 --> 00:06:48,920
Yeah.

265
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,150
I think it's probably pretty light.

266
00:06:50,151 --> 00:06:50,690
Yeah.

267
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:51,560
All the carbon fiber,

268
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:52,100
the things up.

269
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,250
No fucking rocket check the way Jamie.

270
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,410
I bet it's 3,900 pounds easy.

271
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,600
Do you think it's almost 4,000 no way.

272
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,350
Yeah,

273
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,040
I bet it is.

274
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,480
Several of the cushy shit in it.

275
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,670
16 you know,

276
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,740
mid three seconds.

277
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,790
Zero to 60 yeah,

278
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,560
I bet it's a 3,900 pounds.

279
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,160
Google a g 53 50 a GT,

280
00:07:13,161 --> 00:07:14,180
three 50 are,

281
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,790
they'll have the curb weight on a,

282
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,700
if there's a bunch of carbon fiber,

283
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,910
something of me that that carbon fiber,

284
00:07:20,911 --> 00:07:23,060
that's a pretty cushy mostly for looks.

285
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,040
No.

286
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,420
Yeah.

287
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,251
It's so strong,

288
00:07:25,251 --> 00:07:25,730
dude.

289
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:26,530
Yeah,

290
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:27,650
but it's mostly for,

291
00:07:27,651 --> 00:07:32,270
looks like it's not making it that much
light at 3,700 pounds and that's the

292
00:07:32,271 --> 00:07:33,470
most track ready one.

293
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:37,340
So this is going to be heavier than
the GT three 50 because it has a

294
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,410
supercharger on it.

295
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:41,930
The supercharger and all that other
jazz is probably about a hundred pounds.

296
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,271
So yeah,

297
00:07:43,271 --> 00:07:43,660
I think so.

298
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:43,971
Robert?

299
00:07:43,971 --> 00:07:44,804
800 pounds.

300
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,730
3,700 yeah,

301
00:07:46,731 --> 00:07:47,360
for that one.

302
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,360
But that's the three 50 to three
the gt 500 has a a a big ass whipple

303
00:07:52,881 --> 00:07:55,790
supercharger on it to
make it even heavier.

304
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:56,631
Sound so good though.

305
00:07:56,631 --> 00:07:58,070
You were here a supercharger whine.

306
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:58,620
Fuck.

307
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,330
Yay.

308
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,890
That's American power though.

309
00:08:01,891 --> 00:08:02,310
You know,

310
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,143
they're not light.

311
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:04,051
They're heavy,

312
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:05,560
you know big ass engines.

313
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:06,481
Well that's the thing.

314
00:08:06,481 --> 00:08:08,130
It's like that's what you
want kind of in there.

315
00:08:08,131 --> 00:08:10,110
They're trying to make a muscle car,

316
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,780
a precision scalpel instrument,

317
00:08:12,781 --> 00:08:15,750
like a nine 11 gt three it's not that.

318
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,710
It's a different thing.

319
00:08:16,711 --> 00:08:19,380
It's not where we're looking for
like the white car that I have,

320
00:08:19,381 --> 00:08:20,220
the gt three Rs,

321
00:08:20,221 --> 00:08:21,054
the shark works car,

322
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,770
that car is a scalpel.

323
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,480
It's precision.

324
00:08:24,481 --> 00:08:28,260
It's effortless the way it handles and
maneuvers and it's just a different

325
00:08:28,261 --> 00:08:29,094
experience.

326
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,440
But a muscle car is
supposed to thrill you.

327
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,610
Supposed to be exciting.

328
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:33,181
Yeah.

329
00:08:33,181 --> 00:08:33,691
You don't want to,

330
00:08:33,691 --> 00:08:34,171
yeah.

331
00:08:34,171 --> 00:08:36,690
It's not going to beat
any fucking track town.

332
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,530
You know you care.

333
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,370
You're not trying to,

334
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,323
I mean,

335
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:42,180
what do you Nicholas cage
and gone in 60 seconds.

336
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,690
My brother always says that streetcar car.

337
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,031
I'm like,

338
00:08:45,031 --> 00:08:46,530
my thing would beat the
shit of that and he's like,

339
00:08:46,531 --> 00:08:47,370
not on the track though.

340
00:08:47,371 --> 00:08:47,740
I'm like,

341
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:47,930
ah,

342
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,490
I'm on the five.

343
00:08:49,491 --> 00:08:52,030
I don't fuck he's old.

344
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,880
I look like on the track.

345
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:58,200
I know it's so a irresponsible to
even be able to sell these cars.

346
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,970
Like when they're selling these Corvettes,

347
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:04,100
these new corvette zr
one with 757 horsepower.

348
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,850
They have a sub three seconds,

349
00:09:05,851 --> 00:09:08,130
zero to 60 it's like 2.6 seconds.

350
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,400
There needs to be like an Iq test for
that thing name and a driving test like

351
00:09:11,401 --> 00:09:13,200
what do you believe in flat earth.

352
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,131
You know what I'm saying?

353
00:09:14,131 --> 00:09:14,964
Like,

354
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,780
what was it about that pizza gate

355
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:26,580
that new Tesla roadster is going to
be zero to 60 in under two seconds.

356
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:29,190
That's trouble because
every moron that doesn't,

357
00:09:29,191 --> 00:09:29,311
oh,

358
00:09:29,311 --> 00:09:33,480
cars getting Tesla because it's like the
new Prius cool thing to do and so they

359
00:09:33,481 --> 00:09:36,330
get those things and they're
fucking lightning rods.

360
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:36,890
Lightening.

361
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:37,410
I can't,

362
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,190
I just,

363
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,480
I know I'm super old school.

364
00:09:39,481 --> 00:09:40,770
I can't fuck with them.

365
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:41,910
I don't like them.

366
00:09:41,911 --> 00:09:42,740
I getting calendar.

367
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,710
That bumps me out.

368
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,670
That's just not for me,

369
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:45,150
man.

370
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:45,661
I just,

371
00:09:45,661 --> 00:09:46,494
I don't,

372
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,090
I like the sound of an engine.

373
00:09:48,091 --> 00:09:48,810
I like,

374
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:49,231
I don't know.

375
00:09:49,231 --> 00:09:49,870
I don't like,

376
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:50,210
yeah,

377
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,660
you feel like you're driving an iPod.

378
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,760
I don't care how fucking fast it goes.

379
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:54,270
It's just,

380
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,650
it does nothing for me.

381
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,730
Callen goes back and forth
from complaining about it
to tell you how you should

382
00:09:59,731 --> 00:10:00,270
get one.

383
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:00,391
Oh,

384
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:00,750
I know.

385
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,583
It's very strange.

386
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:02,820
It depends what day you catch them.

387
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,860
It depends which day it is.

388
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,750
It's like he's tried to talk you into it.

389
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:07,561
It's like he's so,

390
00:10:07,561 --> 00:10:08,640
he doesn't feel alone now.

391
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,690
Cause like I love that thing.

392
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,830
I fucking love that thing.

393
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,693
The next day it's like,

394
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,300
I don't do that thing,

395
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:14,040
the charge.

396
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,360
I just don't know man.

397
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:15,830
Well,

398
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:16,261
there you go.

399
00:10:16,261 --> 00:10:17,270
Should I get a Porsche you?

400
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:17,761
She'll be like,

401
00:10:17,761 --> 00:10:18,121
you and Joe.

402
00:10:18,121 --> 00:10:18,731
Should I get a Porsche?

403
00:10:18,731 --> 00:10:19,564
I'm like,

404
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:20,851
Shit.

405
00:10:20,851 --> 00:10:21,684
I be like,

406
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,003
Oh man,

407
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:27,690
he should get something that's reliable
that he could drive around everywhere

408
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:28,861
that you know,

409
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:30,270
like a BMW or something?

410
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:31,280
Yeah.

411
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:31,770
Yeah.

412
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,360
Like you should just
get like a five series,

413
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,740
three series.

414
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,170
But as ego won't let
them and he's a big car.

415
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:38,010
Really?

416
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:38,191
Oh,

417
00:10:38,191 --> 00:10:39,360
he won't get a small car now.

418
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,380
Why does it need a big car?

419
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:41,330
You know?

420
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:41,521
Okay.

421
00:10:41,521 --> 00:10:42,570
It's Callen man.

422
00:10:42,571 --> 00:10:43,740
Your life is a big car.

423
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:43,891
Well,

424
00:10:43,891 --> 00:10:44,100
yeah,

425
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,060
he wants to be manly.

426
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:48,480
You know he's not going to get
jars or mammy before to him.

427
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,873
Brian,

428
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:51,841
he wants to be manly.

429
00:10:51,841 --> 00:10:52,481
Why would he get a car?

430
00:10:52,481 --> 00:10:56,010
It doesn't make any noise because
he's even thinking about that.

431
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,720
He doesn't care about like dual.

432
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,370
If you ask him what dual exhaust is,

433
00:10:59,371 --> 00:11:00,330
he booked half an idea.

434
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,100
He doesn't know what dual exhaust.

435
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,580
No,

436
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,241
it's fucking,

437
00:11:03,241 --> 00:11:04,190
he's not into that stuff.

438
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:04,951
Those two times.

439
00:11:04,951 --> 00:11:05,670
You know what happened?

440
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:08,100
He took a chance the way back in the day.

441
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:12,660
I want to say like 2000
fucking two or three.

442
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:15,420
He had a Ford Bronco like 1969.

443
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:16,340
Oh hell ago.

444
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:17,641
It was bad ass,

445
00:11:17,641 --> 00:11:18,420
but really?

446
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:18,781
Yeah.

447
00:11:18,781 --> 00:11:19,320
Yeah.

448
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,460
But it stunk.

449
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,470
It was one of them old school ones.

450
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,760
It wasn't like an icon one.

451
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:26,130
It was an old school one
with a carburetor and shit.

452
00:11:26,131 --> 00:11:27,810
So you smelled gas fumes everywhere.

453
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:28,411
He loved it.

454
00:11:28,411 --> 00:11:31,890
Didn't have any doors and it
didn't have a top Kallin had this,

455
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,113
it was dope.

456
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:33,983
Yeah.

457
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:34,831
Give it to him.

458
00:11:34,831 --> 00:11:36,080
But he didn't know I bought it.

459
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,573
Yes he did.

460
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:38,940
Yeah.

461
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,330
He decided he was a wild man and
he was going to drive around it.

462
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,170
Um,

463
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,640
it was a stick shift,

464
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,290
stick shift.

465
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:46,471
Uh,

466
00:11:46,471 --> 00:11:47,760
pretty sure the stick shift.

467
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,410
Ford Bronco,

468
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,870
early Bronco and put his
pit bull in the back.

469
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,100
Yeah.

470
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,760
It has a tank top old man
living on Venice beach,

471
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:59,680
single single guy taken down if free
buddy insight just out there on the,

472
00:11:59,681 --> 00:12:00,520
on the freak prowl,

473
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,920
just dropping loads
all over Venice and uh,

474
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:03,520
couldn't,

475
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,353
couldn't keep it up.

476
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:05,050
I got,

477
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,250
I was looking up the roadster.

478
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:09,610
This is a Audi's new thing
that they just announced.

479
00:12:09,611 --> 00:12:13,420
It's called the P be 18 Jesus Christ.

480
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,190
That's an electric car in a arrival.

481
00:12:15,191 --> 00:12:16,024
The roadster,

482
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,250
same speed is what they're sorta claiming.

483
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:21,190
It will go a zero to 60
in just under two seconds.

484
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,300
Jesus starts getting too fat.

485
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,640
Look how good it looks though.

486
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,310
It charges in 15 minutes,

487
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,310
but yeah.

488
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:30,000
What?

489
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,370
Yeah.

490
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:31,540
How the fuck is that possible?

491
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,920
Because the Germans said,

492
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:33,491
oh Tesla,

493
00:12:33,491 --> 00:12:34,300
you're making cars.

494
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:34,960
Very cool.

495
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,280
Let us try as this coming out,

496
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,290
there's only going to be about 50 of them,

497
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,124
mate.

498
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:39,950
Fuck you.

499
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:42,190
You fuck sons of bitches again,

500
00:12:42,191 --> 00:12:44,800
even that like it looks dope,

501
00:12:44,801 --> 00:12:46,030
but because I'd rather have,

502
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:48,700
you know the r eight with a a gas inches,

503
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:51,780
a beastly looking spaceship of
a video looks pretty much like,

504
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:53,740
oh,

505
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,120
it's got a seat in the center.

506
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:56,130
Yeah,

507
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:56,351
I see.

508
00:12:56,351 --> 00:12:57,184
Yeah,

509
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,570
you get one seat.

510
00:12:58,810 --> 00:12:59,680
I like that.

511
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,160
I took that.

512
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:00,911
If you got a girlfriend,

513
00:13:00,911 --> 00:13:02,920
you told her to sit in the
backseat and rub my neck.

514
00:13:02,921 --> 00:13:03,790
CanNot kick rocks,

515
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,633
bitch.

516
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,610
Get an Uber meets you there.

517
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:08,420
Doesn't have a backseat.

518
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,630
We take off.

519
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,430
You can't peel rubber and those things.

520
00:13:12,431 --> 00:13:15,670
You just go fucking filthy though.

521
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,553
It has a dirty,

522
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:17,590
yeah,

523
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,000
I bet they're going to
come out of the gas pedal.

524
00:13:19,001 --> 00:13:19,171
Right.

525
00:13:19,171 --> 00:13:20,050
It looks just the same.

526
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:25,380
Well apparently people are taking the
ACURA NSX and they're replacing their

527
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,260
other,

528
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,830
doing something to the
boots are replacing the ECU.

529
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,053
So they're uh,

530
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,020
changing the,

531
00:13:32,021 --> 00:13:32,520
the,

532
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,930
the program that they use to,

533
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,040
to,

534
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,351
you know,

535
00:13:36,351 --> 00:13:38,200
and using the changing,

536
00:13:38,201 --> 00:13:41,970
using a aftermarket exhaust and
just Jack in a horse and stores.

537
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,390
It's what you do with those.

538
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:46,480
Did I fucking knew Nsx
is a beast of a car mat?

539
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,260
They're cool.

540
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,790
I didn't realize how
small they were though.

541
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:51,040
I one pulled up to me the other night.

542
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,200
It was like revenues in general.

543
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:52,361
Like,

544
00:13:52,361 --> 00:13:52,511
dude,

545
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,410
we're not doing this.

546
00:13:53,411 --> 00:13:54,170
I don't know.

547
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:56,200
I'm 35 years old.

548
00:13:56,201 --> 00:13:57,034
We're not.

549
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,120
Um,

550
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,590
and he was a grown man to,

551
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,020
this is off sunset was
coming home from the store.

552
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,230
No Brag about it to blew bloom
off the line at the red light.

553
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,490
I don't like what are going to do,

554
00:14:06,491 --> 00:14:06,731
man,

555
00:14:06,731 --> 00:14:07,750
I don't get this.

556
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,880
But I didn't realize
how small they were now.

557
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:10,511
Yeah,

558
00:14:10,511 --> 00:14:11,140
they're pretty little.

559
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:11,301
Yeah,

560
00:14:11,301 --> 00:14:11,481
it was.

561
00:14:11,481 --> 00:14:13,150
The old ones are real little.

562
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,590
That's what it looks like now.

563
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:15,543
That's a diff,

564
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,430
that's a deep red.

565
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:18,320
Oh,

566
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,153
I like that.

567
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,140
What's the guards red?

568
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:20,830
It's a Porsche.

569
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:21,670
Could look in car.

570
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,300
Goddammit.

571
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,133
It's cool.

572
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:24,400
That's very McLaren.

573
00:14:24,401 --> 00:14:24,780
Ish.

574
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,180
Yeah,

575
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,013
a little bit.

576
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:26,220
Well,

577
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:26,710
it's there.

578
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:29,230
They're making them spaceshipy you know,

579
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:29,590
dude,

580
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,131
there was a,

581
00:14:30,131 --> 00:14:33,130
I was in Edmonton this past
weekend freezing at the giant mall,

582
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:36,790
but in the middle of the mall there's a
McLaren and you know that malls filled

583
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:37,331
with kids.

584
00:14:37,331 --> 00:14:40,480
Cause there's wave pools and dolphin.

585
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,830
There's all sorts of shit there.

586
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,480
It's the biggest mall in North America.

587
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,050
And this poor Mclaren,

588
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,150
it was hurting my feelings.

589
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:46,870
Cause there's,

590
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:47,710
there's kids everywhere.

591
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,600
They don't give a fuck about the MC Lynn.

592
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,700
They're yanking on the
fucking mirrors is awesome.

593
00:14:52,701 --> 00:14:53,990
Kick kick in the back.

594
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,291
I'm like,

595
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:54,890
dude,

596
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:55,760
what are you guys doing?

597
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:56,960
It's just parked in the middle.

598
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:58,101
Just says like,

599
00:14:58,101 --> 00:14:58,550
uh,

600
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:58,821
you know,

601
00:14:58,821 --> 00:15:00,020
like a showcase car.

602
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:00,850
Don't even have a rose.

603
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,450
They're on it all the no ropes,

604
00:15:02,451 --> 00:15:03,200
nothing.

605
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,470
Kids wiping their shitty sticky
fingers in it and picking their nose,

606
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:07,500
right.

607
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,630
Boogers in Lego's,

608
00:15:08,631 --> 00:15:11,150
just fucking edge and their
names and the side and shit.

609
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,343
I know,

610
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:12,651
I was like,

611
00:15:12,651 --> 00:15:12,951
come on,

612
00:15:12,951 --> 00:15:16,970
make laryngeal or pride on why would they
let pull that taste usually sell on a

613
00:15:16,971 --> 00:15:18,470
lot of Mclaren's and Edmonton.

614
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:19,723
I don't know.

615
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,970
It is that oil money starts
to burn a hole in your pocket.

616
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,040
A lot of those guys up there in Alberta,

617
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,210
they get those jobs,

618
00:15:26,211 --> 00:15:28,310
which are tough fucking jobs.

619
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,000
The oil,

620
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,950
all my great hard work,

621
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:31,641
hard work,

622
00:15:31,641 --> 00:15:32,540
but big money.

623
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:33,590
Um,

624
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:36,740
my friend John Rivet
and his wife Jen there,

625
00:15:36,741 --> 00:15:38,930
their son was doing it for awhile.

626
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,880
Kind of a bad business to be in though.

627
00:15:40,881 --> 00:15:41,211
Right?

628
00:15:41,211 --> 00:15:43,460
So it's oil is kind of on the way out.

629
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,503
Uh,

630
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,950
not up there,

631
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:46,211
I think.

632
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:46,790
I think it's,

633
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,050
I think it's down though.

634
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:48,381
I know.

635
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:50,160
I know it's down because
the economy there,

636
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:50,870
uh,

637
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,220
one of the drivers was telling me,

638
00:15:52,221 --> 00:15:52,461
he's like,

639
00:15:52,461 --> 00:15:52,641
yeah,

640
00:15:52,641 --> 00:15:53,660
well it's just not what it's,

641
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:53,901
you know,

642
00:15:53,901 --> 00:15:56,000
it's a fraction of the price
than what it was a year ago,

643
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,000
two years ago.

644
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,501
Oh really?

645
00:15:57,501 --> 00:16:02,000
So we're taking hits from it can imagine
if that was like your business and your

646
00:16:02,001 --> 00:16:05,340
business could just fluctuate that
hard like all of a sudden and down.

647
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:08,240
It's just useless.

648
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:08,781
Well,

649
00:16:08,781 --> 00:16:10,370
cause eventually it's going to be useless.

650
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:12,230
[inaudible] our lifetime.

651
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,100
Well not with assholes.

652
00:16:13,101 --> 00:16:15,140
I guess it don't want
to drive electric cars.

653
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:15,530
I know.

654
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,330
I think about the whole tie
thing about it with my son,

655
00:16:17,331 --> 00:16:20,000
like God help this little perk isn't
just driving Teslas everywhere.

656
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:24,260
Like I want to educate
them on Topaz rights,

657
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,510
but that's fucking at the planet.

658
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,830
But also is it?

659
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,210
It is.

660
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:29,720
You think?

661
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,320
Yeah,

662
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,050
for sure.

663
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:31,330
Yeah.

664
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:33,080
So then we should be in electric.

665
00:16:33,081 --> 00:16:34,100
It's having an effect.

666
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:34,910
Yeah.

667
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,970
But the question is how much of an effect,

668
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,730
what is having the most effect?

669
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,220
There's a lot of different things that
are having an effect and what's our

670
00:16:43,221 --> 00:16:44,630
footprint and that effect.

671
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,673
You know what I'm saying?

672
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,030
There's a lot.

673
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:47,481
I mean,

674
00:16:47,481 --> 00:16:48,230
human beings,

675
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:52,640
there's a lot of us and we're definitely
burning a lot of shit and putting a lot

676
00:16:52,641 --> 00:16:55,280
of carbon into the
atmosphere and there's a,

677
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:56,630
there's definitely an impact.

678
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:56,841
Well,

679
00:16:56,841 --> 00:16:58,400
it starts with the eyes and impact.

680
00:16:58,401 --> 00:16:58,881
It's crazy.

681
00:16:58,881 --> 00:16:59,160
The core,

682
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:04,160
the real question is how much of an
impact and can it be turned around and uh,

683
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:05,180
how much,

684
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,770
how much of a bad thing is it actually,

685
00:17:06,771 --> 00:17:08,090
because somewhere in the,

686
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,230
it's in the middle of,

687
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:09,921
there's,

688
00:17:09,921 --> 00:17:14,040
you got your ultimate doom
and gloom people that are all,

689
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,420
they're saying that all of the
city's going to be underwater.

690
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:19,460
Fucking east coast can be underwater.

691
00:17:19,461 --> 00:17:20,770
The west coast could be underwater.

692
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:21,643
Everyone's fucked.

693
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,090
And then you've got the
other people that say,

694
00:17:23,091 --> 00:17:23,541
no,

695
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,550
we're just going to be able
to move it in northern Canada.

696
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:26,923
Jesus Christ,

697
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,610
the of the people who
think that you could just,

698
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:31,640
we're just going to have up there
beautiful spots in Antarctica.

699
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:32,563
Yeah,

700
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:33,450
I dunno.

701
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,400
Maybe somewhere in the middle.

702
00:17:34,401 --> 00:17:34,670
Huh?

703
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:35,540
It's somewhere in the middle.

704
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:36,403
Somewhere in the middle.

705
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:37,603
I'm a middle guy.

706
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,540
The Real,

707
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:39,080
uh,

708
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:44,080
optimist think that we're going to be
able to take some of the carbon out of the

709
00:17:44,391 --> 00:17:46,850
atmosphere and the way they're
going to be able to do it.

710
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,730
They actually invented this
giant that looks like a building.

711
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:55,760
It's like a building size machine that's
like a huge air filter that just sucks

712
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:58,590
carbon out of the air.

713
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,150
I think they did it since,

714
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,680
I think it's a Chinese
thing and I think they,

715
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:03,120
they're,

716
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,180
they're installing them somewhere in
China because you know like when the

717
00:18:06,181 --> 00:18:08,580
athletes were in Beijing for the Olympics,

718
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,110
they said the air and my God,

719
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,420
the air quality was like smoking
a pack of cigarettes a day.

720
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:12,631
Dude,

721
00:18:12,631 --> 00:18:15,870
you don't realize how important the
air quality is till when those fires.

722
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,640
I was doing shows in Sacramento.

723
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,630
I didn't even think of it.

724
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,210
Pete and fans or a DM,

725
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:21,751
are you going to do,

726
00:18:21,751 --> 00:18:22,411
are you going to cancel?

727
00:18:22,411 --> 00:18:23,041
Please don't cancel.

728
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:23,460
I'm like,

729
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,760
why the fuck would I cancel a night?

730
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:26,340
I don't cancel shows.

731
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,353
I'll see sin man.

732
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,000
Then I fly in and I was like,

733
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:31,530
Oh shit.

734
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,780
You couldn't see a foot
in front of your face.

735
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,010
She sent me a smoke.

736
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:37,470
You sent me a picture from
your hotel room and I was like,

737
00:18:37,471 --> 00:18:38,850
is there a fire in your room?

738
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,320
I've never seen anything like it and I
did not feel good off sick the whole time

739
00:18:43,321 --> 00:18:44,460
there to my shows,

740
00:18:44,461 --> 00:18:45,294
US lightheaded,

741
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:47,820
everyone had mass gone
like Asians at airports.

742
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,070
Everybody set for me and my brother.

743
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,060
And guess what?

744
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,040
We couldn't get any mass
cause they're all sold out.

745
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,143
Did they help?

746
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,140
Yeah,

747
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:55,973
I think so.

748
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,450
They filter some of it,

749
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,700
but I didn't realize
how big of a deal was.

750
00:18:59,701 --> 00:19:00,690
Ty went up there and I'm like,

751
00:19:00,691 --> 00:19:01,560
Holy Shit Man,

752
00:19:01,561 --> 00:19:02,190
this is,

753
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,180
this is serious.

754
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,400
Those fires were so big.

755
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,930
The mean the fires down here,

756
00:19:06,931 --> 00:19:10,800
we're big but nothing compared to the
northern California fires because of the

757
00:19:10,801 --> 00:19:14,880
area of northern California
that got lit up was like woods,

758
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,470
like huge,

759
00:19:16,471 --> 00:19:17,670
huge wooded areas.

760
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,080
And the whole town was just,

761
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:20,370
it's not there anymore.

762
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:22,530
It was a paradise done.

763
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:23,690
Game over does.

764
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:24,523
No,

765
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:25,830
nothing's,

766
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:26,400
nothing.

767
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,590
The whole town burned down British.

768
00:19:27,591 --> 00:19:29,070
Sure go to that.

769
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,540
Pull up paradise.

770
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,040
california.com.

771
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:33,931
Is that a,

772
00:19:33,931 --> 00:19:37,140
is that a place that I
want to sit down now?

773
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,281
Do you see?

774
00:19:38,281 --> 00:19:39,800
They fired the Frickin uh,

775
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:44,430
some of the firefighters in like a relief
people cause they were taking pictures

776
00:19:44,431 --> 00:19:47,730
like not even mock and I don't think they
should have been fired because it was

777
00:19:47,731 --> 00:19:49,770
like all burnt down house
and then there's like,

778
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,311
I don't know,

779
00:19:50,311 --> 00:19:54,450
like a wooden horse and then
like firefighters like on
the wooden horse and like

780
00:19:54,451 --> 00:19:56,950
go like your mark mocking the
people lost their homes and they,

781
00:19:56,951 --> 00:19:58,110
oh they lost their jobs.

782
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,401
That's crazy.

783
00:19:59,401 --> 00:20:00,091
Come on man.

784
00:20:00,091 --> 00:20:01,800
This guys are fighting
for their life out there.

785
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:03,120
That probably just to do with it.

786
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,010
Not only that,

787
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:04,390
the,

788
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:05,610
the horses there,

789
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,470
it's like,

790
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,680
well what do you give a shit?

791
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:09,351
Why?

792
00:20:09,351 --> 00:20:10,210
Why the,

793
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,640
the house is burned to the ground.

794
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,570
You really think it's that in that poor
taste for these poor guys who risked

795
00:20:15,571 --> 00:20:18,000
their lives to save people's
houses to have a good time.

796
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:18,990
Why was that real?

797
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,390
This is crazy.

798
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,440
I should have made it out of those trees.

799
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:27,560
Trees are still standing in.

800
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:28,640
The trees are pretty gangster.

801
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:29,860
What's going on?

802
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:33,480
Like at a certain point in time we're
going to have to make fireproof houses.

803
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,573
Does that exist?

804
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,350
Yes.

805
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:38,700
Making them out of cinder
block or you got to do what?

806
00:20:38,701 --> 00:20:41,280
Kanye didn't just have your
own fricking fire department.

807
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:42,990
Just surround your house just in case.

808
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:43,824
That's a good move.

809
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:44,940
In my neighborhood,

810
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:46,950
there's a house that burnt to the ground.

811
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:51,100
I put pictures of it up on my
Instagram as a car in the driveway.

812
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,121
But the,

813
00:20:52,121 --> 00:20:52,954
um,

814
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:53,861
this is,

815
00:20:53,861 --> 00:20:55,180
this picture is terrifying.

816
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:55,661
Oh Dude.

817
00:20:55,661 --> 00:20:57,820
You're talking Armageddon style.

818
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,050
This fixture is terrifying.

819
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:03,160
Is this what we're looking at
as rows of houses that are gone?

820
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,380
That looks like it goes
for an entire neighborhood.

821
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,303
It's an entire neighborhood.

822
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:09,070
Why second mile and just
there's nothing left.

823
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,360
Everything's burnt to the ground,

824
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,251
but it's amazing.

825
00:21:12,251 --> 00:21:13,270
Those trees are still standing.

826
00:21:13,271 --> 00:21:14,140
Look at those trees there.

827
00:21:14,141 --> 00:21:14,360
I mean,

828
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,101
their torch,

829
00:21:15,101 --> 00:21:15,461
but yeah,

830
00:21:15,461 --> 00:21:16,120
they're there.

831
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:16,300
Yeah,

832
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:16,811
but it's weird.

833
00:21:16,811 --> 00:21:17,680
Black as fuck.

834
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:18,551
Isn't it weird?

835
00:21:18,551 --> 00:21:20,710
Wouldn't you expect the trees
would be burnt to a crisp?

836
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:21,700
Yeah,

837
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,810
they're so thick.

838
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:23,981
The other thing is,

839
00:21:23,981 --> 00:21:24,610
uh,

840
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:25,930
where's that coming from?

841
00:21:25,931 --> 00:21:26,230
Ed.

842
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,460
I flew down.

843
00:21:27,461 --> 00:21:32,320
So from north to south and when you go
over Malibu and like in Woodland Hills

844
00:21:32,321 --> 00:21:33,490
and where you live,

845
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,331
you wouldn't bell kit.

846
00:21:34,331 --> 00:21:35,170
When you see all that,

847
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:36,640
it's insane.

848
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,140
From a bird's eye view,

849
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:41,140
you can just see all the
black women flying into La.

850
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:41,680
Well,

851
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,310
I flew over a Malibu with
burr and a helicopter,

852
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,510
so we got real low.

853
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:47,290
It was,

854
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:47,951
it's crazy.

855
00:21:47,951 --> 00:21:48,670
Crazy.

856
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,260
We get this Mcdonald's
burnt to the ground.

857
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,183
That's crazy.

858
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:54,520
You know that motherfucker
burned when cheese,

859
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:58,180
that bridge burnt well,

860
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,470
I like this thought of
before and after steel.

861
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,040
Well it's not.

862
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,780
It's wooden.

863
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,230
That was a,

864
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:02,621
what was it?

865
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:04,990
A wooden bridge wouldn't
look at this like the whole,

866
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:05,824
everything's gone.

867
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:10,120
So is that the case that the
whole town is evaporated?

868
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:10,811
Ice Is gone.

869
00:22:10,811 --> 00:22:11,000
Yeah,

870
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,530
pretty sure.

871
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:16,530
Paradise is what the fuck those people
do now the do you don't rebuild,

872
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:18,101
right?

873
00:22:18,101 --> 00:22:18,461
You're like,

874
00:22:18,461 --> 00:22:19,294
wow,

875
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:20,500
Jesus.

876
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,870
Then also a lot of it in this,

877
00:22:22,871 --> 00:22:24,850
just from my own experience down here,

878
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:30,030
I'm looking at homes in
areas where there's chances
of fire that were caused by

879
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:30,530
fires.

880
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:33,790
Banks won't give you the loan
or you have to put a higher,

881
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:38,260
almost all cash payment down
real [inaudible] and also
the house insurance on a

882
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:39,191
fire area.

883
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,450
They're not going to do it these days.

884
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,070
But what are they going to
do with a place like Malibu?

885
00:22:42,071 --> 00:22:43,990
Because Malibu got hit
harder than anything.

886
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,150
They lost 600 plus houses.

887
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:46,700
Find out.

888
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,530
That's true.

889
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:49,840
I know they said they
lost like 1500 structures,

890
00:22:49,841 --> 00:22:52,090
but someone told me that
600 of those warehouses,

891
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:54,070
and if you're talking about Malibu,

892
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:58,450
like when Burt and I were flying
around the coastline over by zoom,

893
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,020
uh,

894
00:22:59,020 --> 00:22:59,853
point doom,

895
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:01,510
you know those beautiful beach there?

896
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,050
Well James Beach,

897
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:04,951
I don't know,

898
00:23:04,951 --> 00:23:07,480
it's the cliffs fire.

899
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:13,140
Worst fired to hit Malibu with
home loss is topping 1.6 billion.

900
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:13,631
Bubba,

901
00:23:13,631 --> 00:23:13,901
Bubba,

902
00:23:13,901 --> 00:23:14,231
Bubba,

903
00:23:14,231 --> 00:23:15,310
Bubba billion,

904
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,540
620 structures destroyed.

905
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:21,490
I feel like we don't hear about it
so much because I think people assume

906
00:23:21,491 --> 00:23:22,870
everyone Malibu has money.

907
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,470
They are a higher tax bracket
so that God will figure it out.

908
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,510
It's still super fucked up,

909
00:23:28,511 --> 00:23:28,900
man.

910
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,231
Well,

911
00:23:29,231 --> 00:23:31,930
I have friends that don't
have a lot of money,

912
00:23:31,931 --> 00:23:34,030
but they build houses and one of them,

913
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:38,200
one of the houses they were living in and
the other house they were building and

914
00:23:38,201 --> 00:23:38,951
they're all the,

915
00:23:38,951 --> 00:23:40,270
both houses got torched.

916
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:44,860
400 single family houses with an
estimated market value of 1.6 billion.

917
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,700
So 670 structures,

918
00:23:46,701 --> 00:23:48,440
400 of them were houses.

919
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,640
That's horrible man.

920
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,793
Whew.

921
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:54,880
It's a weird to fly over man when
you fly over it because in the,

922
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:55,743
with a helicopter,

923
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:56,430
you know,

924
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:58,150
[inaudible] was pretty close.

925
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:58,581
We were,

926
00:23:58,581 --> 00:23:59,150
we were,

927
00:23:59,150 --> 00:23:59,751
you know,

928
00:23:59,751 --> 00:24:01,100
right above it and circling,

929
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:01,911
you know,

930
00:24:01,911 --> 00:24:05,390
just outside right over the ocean and
as you do an it flying over the ocean,

931
00:24:05,391 --> 00:24:07,670
you're looking at these compounds.

932
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:09,860
They are probably $50 million houses.

933
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:11,630
I mean these fucking massive,

934
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:13,940
massive compounds burnt to the ground.

935
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:17,000
Not a goddamn thing
they could do about it.

936
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,980
How good of a pilot is burr?

937
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:19,880
Terrible.

938
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,960
We almost died three times.

939
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:21,740
Jesus Christ.

940
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:21,891
No,

941
00:24:21,891 --> 00:24:22,400
he's great.

942
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:22,821
Is He?

943
00:24:22,821 --> 00:24:23,031
Yeah,

944
00:24:23,031 --> 00:24:23,581
he's crazy.

945
00:24:23,581 --> 00:24:25,730
So he could have it that he's
been doing it for a while.

946
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,080
When I saw that picks on my cal,

947
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:31,900
I trust that guy 100% and if he told me
that he was going to take me up in the

948
00:24:31,901 --> 00:24:32,391
helicopter,

949
00:24:32,391 --> 00:24:33,140
he knows how to do it.

950
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:33,860
Yeah,

951
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,521
it was a good time,

952
00:24:34,521 --> 00:24:35,150
man.

953
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:35,691
We had fun.

954
00:24:35,691 --> 00:24:36,590
We had a lot of laughs.

955
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:37,483
Is it fun?

956
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:38,660
So much fun.

957
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:39,160
You're,

958
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,220
you're up in a helicopter.

959
00:24:40,221 --> 00:24:43,250
Was one of the greatest comedians that
ever lived where having a good fucking

960
00:24:43,251 --> 00:24:44,450
time were just howling.

961
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,313
Me and him.

962
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,573
He's hilarious.

963
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:51,320
And we talk it through headphones cause
it's like [inaudible] so you got a

964
00:24:51,321 --> 00:24:53,930
little little fucking
like command or some shit.

965
00:24:53,931 --> 00:24:54,351
Hell yeah.

966
00:24:54,351 --> 00:24:56,300
That's sick and microphone in the corner.

967
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:56,571
I don't know.

968
00:24:56,571 --> 00:24:57,740
Helicopters scare me man.

969
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,490
It was a good time.

970
00:24:58,490 --> 00:24:58,641
Yeah,

971
00:24:58,641 --> 00:24:59,121
I saw that.

972
00:24:59,121 --> 00:25:00,020
Scared the fuck out of me.

973
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:02,630
It's weird how close you
can get to downtown La.

974
00:25:02,631 --> 00:25:03,464
Like you're not,

975
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,180
there's no real restrictions.

976
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:07,240
You just fly right next to the building.

977
00:25:07,241 --> 00:25:09,560
So I'm like this is okay
because it's a helicopter.

978
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:10,423
Yeah.

979
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:11,540
Yeah.

980
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,380
That was us right there.

981
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:12,831
Yeah.

982
00:25:12,831 --> 00:25:14,330
We just flying around.

983
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:15,320
I mean,

984
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,950
we were just flying right next to these
buildings and we were the height of the

985
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:21,980
buildings and all those two buildings,

986
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:23,960
see those flat spots
and all those buildings.

987
00:25:23,961 --> 00:25:25,430
Those are all helicopter pads.

988
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,630
Landing Pads,

989
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:26,840
Huh?

990
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,260
Yeah.

991
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:30,020
And some of them are
real narrow and bills.

992
00:25:30,021 --> 00:25:32,390
Like I wouldn't want to lend on
that fucking thing on a windy day.

993
00:25:32,391 --> 00:25:32,780
And I'm like,

994
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:33,291
oh my God,

995
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:34,370
I don't even think about hold up.

996
00:25:34,371 --> 00:25:35,540
It was just you and bird.

997
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,180
There's no,

998
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,060
it was the third guy lies the third guy.

999
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:38,360
Yeah.

1000
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,070
The third guy was a um,

1001
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,300
um,

1002
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,710
you know an instructor.

1003
00:25:42,711 --> 00:25:45,620
He's the guy that bill
that teaches bill but bill.

1004
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:46,130
Gotcha.

1005
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:47,900
But bill can fly solo.

1006
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,670
He has a license to fly solo.

1007
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,511
He flies a lot,

1008
00:25:50,511 --> 00:25:50,810
right?

1009
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:50,961
Yeah.

1010
00:25:50,961 --> 00:25:51,590
He flies.

1011
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:51,921
God,

1012
00:25:51,921 --> 00:25:53,330
I'd just not into that.

1013
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:55,830
I think it'd be awesome
to get up there and do it.

1014
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,440
It's just not pros and cons,

1015
00:25:57,441 --> 00:25:57,960
man.

1016
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,130
Pros you fly around a little bit,

1017
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,180
get real high con die.

1018
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:02,541
Yeah.

1019
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:05,030
But it seemed pretty controlled.

1020
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:06,350
It really does.

1021
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,930
But there's no like
there's no room for error,

1022
00:26:08,931 --> 00:26:09,650
you know what I'm saying?

1023
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:11,060
But like unless you're Harrison Ford,

1024
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:16,100
he crashed and Santa Monica to be
crashed a plane straight up plain.

1025
00:26:16,101 --> 00:26:16,330
Yeah.

1026
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:17,163
Yeah.

1027
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,950
Helicopter Santa Monica crashed.

1028
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,053
Where'd he crashed?

1029
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:20,781
Uh,

1030
00:26:20,781 --> 00:26:21,261
I forget.

1031
00:26:21,261 --> 00:26:22,011
Looked that up Jamie.

1032
00:26:22,011 --> 00:26:24,530
He flew out of Santa Monica
airport and it was like,

1033
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:24,770
ah,

1034
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:27,530
fuck it went down because
he's so high all the time.

1035
00:26:27,531 --> 00:26:28,490
I hear is he really?

1036
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:29,091
Oh Dude,

1037
00:26:29,091 --> 00:26:32,030
he smokes like fuck and
Cheech and Chong Bro.

1038
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:35,690
You smoke weed for Harrison
Ford blazes that up.

1039
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,430
I think when you get that famous,

1040
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:40,430
you probably just want to be high all
the time because life is a dream anyway.

1041
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,300
He just like,

1042
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,890
I just think there's nothing else to,

1043
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:43,771
and he's just like,

1044
00:26:43,771 --> 00:26:44,790
I don't know man.

1045
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:47,040
That doesn't keep you busy.

1046
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:48,510
30 years ago,

1047
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:49,940
we just did one a couple of years ago.

1048
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:51,210
Had a cameo in it.

1049
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,440
He wasn't like the main guy.

1050
00:26:52,441 --> 00:26:53,460
That's why people were pissed.

1051
00:26:53,461 --> 00:26:53,641
Right.

1052
00:26:53,641 --> 00:26:54,900
He got Merkt did he?

1053
00:26:54,901 --> 00:26:55,980
I'm not star wars guy.

1054
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:58,211
Dude.

1055
00:26:58,211 --> 00:26:59,640
That came out forever ago.

1056
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:00,990
Spoiler alert.

1057
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:03,420
There is for everything
as a spoiler it now.

1058
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,290
Oh Dude.

1059
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:06,360
People are seeing game of
Thrones now for the first time.

1060
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:07,740
There's dragons assholes.

1061
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:09,780
It's like with that Dannemora escape.

1062
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:10,920
I've seen that on showtime.

1063
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,153
It's about,

1064
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,470
you know those two guys.

1065
00:27:13,471 --> 00:27:17,700
Harrison Ford saved several lives
by landing plane on golf course.

1066
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:19,123
That,

1067
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,940
what the fuck does that mean?

1068
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,980
Scroll down where that kind of fucking,

1069
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,390
there you go and fucking
hand sell low Indiana Jones.

1070
00:27:30,391 --> 00:27:30,930
But you know what?

1071
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:31,570
Just walked away.

1072
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:32,640
Went fuck this noise.

1073
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:34,560
I'm looking where he crashed
and how the plane went down.

1074
00:27:34,561 --> 00:27:36,150
I'm sure there was a moment where he said,

1075
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,800
I'm not going to risk lives.

1076
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,490
Whatever happens,

1077
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,323
happens.

1078
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:40,740
It's going to be just me.

1079
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:46,130
72 year old actor suffered moderate
injuries after crashing the vehicle.

1080
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:49,710
The vintage to Cedar Poe huskies
find a fucking old plane,

1081
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:52,590
a vintage plane that he
was piloting on the green.

1082
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,050
Uh,

1083
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:55,320
on the golf course Thursday afternoon.

1084
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:59,280
He had lacerations to his
face and possible fractures.

1085
00:27:59,281 --> 00:28:00,630
Television news footage taken,

1086
00:28:00,631 --> 00:28:03,720
showed him on a stretcher
being taken into an ambulance.

1087
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:04,441
Dude,

1088
00:28:04,441 --> 00:28:07,980
he risked life and limb by putting it
down on the golf course instead of trying

1089
00:28:07,981 --> 00:28:08,814
to go further,

1090
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,230
try to get back to the airport.

1091
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,060
Notice how Harrison Ford,

1092
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,680
he's not quoted anything.

1093
00:28:13,681 --> 00:28:14,550
He didn't give a fuck.

1094
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:15,330
How about,

1095
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:15,680
uh,

1096
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,650
we were on the Fox lot.

1097
00:28:16,651 --> 00:28:17,251
Brian and I were,

1098
00:28:17,251 --> 00:28:19,170
when we worked for Fox and uh,

1099
00:28:19,171 --> 00:28:23,490
this Tesla pulls in and it's all tinted
windows and it rolled down the window.

1100
00:28:23,491 --> 00:28:24,390
It's Harrison Ford.

1101
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:25,400
And I go,

1102
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,071
I tell Brian you,

1103
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:26,581
oh shit,

1104
00:28:26,581 --> 00:28:28,080
that's fucking Indiana Jones.

1105
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:28,943
Like joking around.

1106
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:29,911
And Brian,

1107
00:28:29,911 --> 00:28:33,540
I didn't know how big of a Harrison
Ford Fanny's Brian gets super.

1108
00:28:33,541 --> 00:28:35,430
It never seemed like
this gets super nervous.

1109
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:37,040
And Harrison s and Brian,

1110
00:28:37,041 --> 00:28:37,874
he was like this.

1111
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,780
It gives them the peace sign.

1112
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:42,780
I've never seen a grown man give
another grown man a peace sign.

1113
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,920
Here's the forest she likes them.

1114
00:28:43,921 --> 00:28:47,600
Just cause tells you
acknowledged the piece.

1115
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:48,620
I'm just keeps on going,

1116
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:49,290
Yo Bro,

1117
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:52,980
you just gave deuces to
fucking Indiana Jones.

1118
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,023
I will do that.

1119
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,440
It was so great.

1120
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:56,830
Here's a four.

1121
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,230
Didn't get signed.

1122
00:28:58,231 --> 00:28:58,960
The people do.

1123
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,250
What are we,

1124
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:00,370
what do you think that alien,

1125
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:01,770
they'd be coming peas.

1126
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,013
You go like this.

1127
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,303
Y'All do that.

1128
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:04,770
You know what?

1129
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:05,603
I do those good.

1130
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:07,650
I do like this weekend we'll know.

1131
00:29:07,651 --> 00:29:09,480
This is Kinda like Yo,

1132
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:10,770
like not a wave,

1133
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:11,960
but this,

1134
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,020
this is kind of halt.

1135
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:13,441
This is,

1136
00:29:13,441 --> 00:29:14,460
I'm reaching for you,

1137
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,350
reaching for you.

1138
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,530
And then if you go too high,

1139
00:29:17,531 --> 00:29:18,570
it's the Hail Hitler.

1140
00:29:18,571 --> 00:29:19,410
You don't want that.

1141
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:20,840
So you gotta tell you,

1142
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,120
man,

1143
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,520
I'm now I'm thinking I give peace
signs of people all the time.

1144
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,900
You do this all the time.

1145
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,360
Like a 14 year old Korea up teenager girl.

1146
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:27,660
Yup.

1147
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,493
Exactly.

1148
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:29,783
13,

1149
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:31,350
13 year old teenager girl.

1150
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,400
Peace,

1151
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:32,940
peace out.

1152
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,710
Nothing the wrong with that.

1153
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:35,110
My kids to hear all the time,

1154
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,540
but they do sideways like this.

1155
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:37,231
They'll take pictures.

1156
00:29:37,231 --> 00:29:37,650
They were like,

1157
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:38,240
that's,

1158
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:38,850
that's cute.

1159
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:39,690
Lips out though.

1160
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,110
They'll do like this.

1161
00:29:41,111 --> 00:29:42,010
Hand forward,

1162
00:29:42,011 --> 00:29:42,970
this hand backward.

1163
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:44,140
You know they do like this.

1164
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:45,263
Yes.

1165
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,360
Well that's what Brian did.

1166
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:47,200
Harrison Ford.

1167
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,430
Look at that picture right there.

1168
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,720
That's me Bro.

1169
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:52,300
Put a match and running up to
here some four to doing that.

1170
00:29:52,301 --> 00:29:54,960
Freaked him the fuck out
and he's high off his ass.

1171
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:55,480
Yeah,

1172
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,400
I was driving that fucking
electric Dune buggy.

1173
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,693
It was great man.

1174
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:01,991
Yeah.

1175
00:30:01,991 --> 00:30:02,351
He's,

1176
00:30:02,351 --> 00:30:03,184
um,

1177
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,670
I wonder what he does with his
spare time other than fly planes,

1178
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:10,780
but can you make that much money and
you're that famous and then you just sit

1179
00:30:10,781 --> 00:30:11,200
around,

1180
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,033
what do you do?

1181
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,551
I don't know,

1182
00:30:12,551 --> 00:30:13,780
but there's,

1183
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,190
there's certain guys at that level,

1184
00:30:15,191 --> 00:30:15,341
right?

1185
00:30:15,341 --> 00:30:16,360
Like he's so famous.

1186
00:30:16,361 --> 00:30:17,320
He's a whole nother level.

1187
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,730
But I was thinking about last night,

1188
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,210
Dave,

1189
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:21,730
when Dave Chappelle
walked in and it was like,

1190
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,151
you know,

1191
00:30:22,151 --> 00:30:23,950
you're around birds around,

1192
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:26,050
there's some of the greatest
comics in the world.

1193
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:28,210
Then when Dave Chappelle walks in,

1194
00:30:28,211 --> 00:30:31,540
I wonder if it's weird for him
because I can feel the room,

1195
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:35,530
like everyone just stares
at him and he was in the or,

1196
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,230
and I was in there before
he went on and there's,

1197
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,153
I mean,

1198
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,450
there wasn't a seat.

1199
00:30:40,451 --> 00:30:41,760
I mean people are in the hallways.

1200
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:43,720
There's just watch him do
his thing and he's just,

1201
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:44,471
he was up there,

1202
00:30:44,471 --> 00:30:44,981
I don't know,

1203
00:30:44,981 --> 00:30:45,521
an hour,

1204
00:30:45,521 --> 00:30:46,061
two hours,

1205
00:30:46,061 --> 00:30:48,280
just not really doing a set,

1206
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,420
just feeling it out.

1207
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:49,961
I went,

1208
00:30:49,961 --> 00:30:50,111
man,

1209
00:30:50,111 --> 00:30:55,111
that must be weird at where he's
at in life that he just goes up.

1210
00:30:55,301 --> 00:30:57,880
Then it's like the everything
shuts down for him as a comic.

1211
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,350
Like he's not working out right.

1212
00:30:59,351 --> 00:30:59,980
You know what I'm saying?

1213
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:00,101
Well,

1214
00:31:00,101 --> 00:31:01,060
he's definitely working out.

1215
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:01,410
No,

1216
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:02,890
that's not correct,

1217
00:31:02,891 --> 00:31:06,970
but it's different than if somebody else
like all eyes are on them all the time

1218
00:31:06,971 --> 00:31:07,640
nonstop.

1219
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,740
So even him working out,

1220
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:09,790
it's funny as fuck,

1221
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:10,870
you know?

1222
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,050
Well he,

1223
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:14,290
he handles it remarkably well.

1224
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:18,880
Like the way he just around people like
even though he's super duper ridiculous,

1225
00:31:18,881 --> 00:31:19,714
famous,

1226
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:22,540
he handles it like he's
not wanders through.

1227
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:23,111
But man,

1228
00:31:23,111 --> 00:31:25,570
when people start grabbing Adam
and wanting pictures and shit,

1229
00:31:25,571 --> 00:31:26,770
it's so embarrassing.

1230
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,460
Oh,

1231
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:27,850
they just,

1232
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,560
they won't let them talk to people.

1233
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,150
Like say if you're talking to them,

1234
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:35,980
they don't care if you're in a locked in
a conversation about your mom's cancer,

1235
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:36,963
they don't care.

1236
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:37,580
They're just,

1237
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,030
Yo Bro,

1238
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:38,863
can I get a picture?

1239
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:41,950
The day health freak out,

1240
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,773
they freak out.

1241
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:47,320
This is my time to dress
up my Facebook page.

1242
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,410
And they get there with
that and they just liked,

1243
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:51,550
they move in on him like a fucking hawk.

1244
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:53,710
It's just,

1245
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:54,820
it's embarrassing.

1246
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:55,930
It's embarrassing.

1247
00:31:55,930 --> 00:32:00,220
People don't respect another
person having a conversation.

1248
00:32:00,221 --> 00:32:03,040
They don't wait like no
one sits around and wait.

1249
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:04,570
It's like in their head.

1250
00:32:04,571 --> 00:32:05,920
If they don't grab them right now,

1251
00:32:05,921 --> 00:32:07,240
they're never going to get that picture.

1252
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,040
So it doesn't matter who he's talking to.

1253
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:09,874
These,

1254
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:10,541
I've seen it too.

1255
00:32:10,541 --> 00:32:15,541
Like I was talking to the rock once and
this dude literally slid in between us

1256
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:22,770
and held his phone up to the rock
slid in between is it just didn't ask.

1257
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:27,910
He was taking the picture as he was asking
these two pictures with you and just

1258
00:32:27,911 --> 00:32:30,580
like in between us like I'm talking to,

1259
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,800
hey what's up and you have a good
time but blah blah blah blah.

1260
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:34,990
And then this guy slides in.

1261
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:40,190
It's got the camera up like no thought
whatsoever for people's and what did the

1262
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:41,000
rock do?

1263
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,210
He's probably used to it by
swallowed saying Jesus Christ.

1264
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:45,500
I handled it like a man.

1265
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,240
It's just such a bummer man.

1266
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:47,760
It is.

1267
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,450
Cause there's a certain
point of fame with Chappelle,

1268
00:32:50,451 --> 00:32:51,284
the rock.

1269
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:54,290
You're probably pretty fucking close
at where you came and go through the

1270
00:32:54,291 --> 00:32:54,950
airport.

1271
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:57,650
Like I have to go through the
airport one time with Tim Tebow.

1272
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,240
Um,

1273
00:32:59,240 --> 00:32:59,481
right.

1274
00:32:59,481 --> 00:33:00,081
I think right,

1275
00:33:00,081 --> 00:33:02,150
right after he went like
this huge playoff game.

1276
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,920
Does he get on a knee
before he gets on a plane?

1277
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:07,250
Now he assumes Jesus is taken care of him.

1278
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:07,910
Oh yeah.

1279
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:08,840
Jesus take the wheel.

1280
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,540
And I knew I was safe
as fuck next to himself.

1281
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:12,823
I didn't give a fuck.

1282
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:17,990
So going through the
report with him and um,

1283
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:18,760
I,

1284
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:18,920
I,

1285
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,940
I felt bad for him.

1286
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,331
I mean,

1287
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:21,164
you're talking,

1288
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:22,071
you can't,

1289
00:33:22,071 --> 00:33:22,940
you can't get anywhere.

1290
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:23,990
It was just like these,

1291
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,690
this mob do,

1292
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,050
this is exhausting.

1293
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,340
Exhausting.

1294
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:30,890
There's to be a certain level
where that's just not cool man.

1295
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:31,021
Well,

1296
00:33:31,021 --> 00:33:31,300
when,

1297
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,720
what change was phones?

1298
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:36,770
Cameras on phones and then social media
because everybody wants a picture.

1299
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:38,030
Whereas before,

1300
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:41,350
I guess people would just want autographs
and no one had a camera with them.

1301
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:44,330
Now the autograph is the Selfie.

1302
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:44,930
Yeah.

1303
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:45,690
There's no more audit.

1304
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,523
Is that something you get?

1305
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:49,200
Like there might be a
few that had a show off,

1306
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:49,961
but once I said,

1307
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:52,910
I'm literally so cute with your death
for an autograph because the other day,

1308
00:33:52,911 --> 00:33:55,400
but it's like a hundred to
one pictures of herself.

1309
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,440
It's all self.

1310
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:56,621
Yeah.

1311
00:33:56,621 --> 00:33:57,454
It's all selfies.

1312
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:58,763
Yeah.

1313
00:33:58,820 --> 00:33:59,653
It's weird.

1314
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:00,741
It's strange.

1315
00:34:00,741 --> 00:34:02,000
This is the life we chose.

1316
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:03,590
This is a weird world we live in.

1317
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,150
Well take it easy.

1318
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,940
You know I'm not Tim Teebo fricking Joe.

1319
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,540
Like you can walk through
an airport bomb done.

1320
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:11,901
Yeah,

1321
00:34:11,901 --> 00:34:12,920
I could walk through an airport.

1322
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:13,400
Yeah,

1323
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,233
it gets weird,

1324
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:15,163
but I can do it.

1325
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:16,880
But like Chapelle it'd be tough.

1326
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:17,330
Yeah.

1327
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:18,470
Well Tom Cruise,

1328
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,150
that motherfucker can't
walk through an airport.

1329
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:20,421
Yeah,

1330
00:34:20,421 --> 00:34:21,141
but you're Tom Cruise.

1331
00:34:21,141 --> 00:34:21,980
You get Tom Cruise money,

1332
00:34:21,981 --> 00:34:23,140
you go private.

1333
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,351
Lax.

1334
00:34:24,351 --> 00:34:24,920
He laughs.

1335
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,520
He laughs.

1336
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,420
Like that's the best joke.

1337
00:34:26,421 --> 00:34:28,800
He's heard that you bring
up lax or Tom Cruise.

1338
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:29,370
What's up?

1339
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:30,450
Fuck on Bro.

1340
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,830
Well we flew over there
when we were with Berger.

1341
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,380
Yeah.

1342
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:33,781
Yeah.

1343
00:34:33,781 --> 00:34:33,991
The,

1344
00:34:33,991 --> 00:34:36,690
the van Nuys Airport flew over
the Tom Cruise experience.

1345
00:34:36,691 --> 00:34:37,730
I feel like he autographs,

1346
00:34:37,731 --> 00:34:40,940
his jet does have like his
signature on his jet has a button.

1347
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:45,530
You can press and then it's all covered
in screens and it turns into the clouds

1348
00:34:45,531 --> 00:34:47,040
behind it and becomes invisible.

1349
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:47,781
Wonder woman.

1350
00:34:47,781 --> 00:34:48,830
Makes Sense.

1351
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,600
It's fucking Tom Cruise Fan,

1352
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:54,350
but don't you think that guy
has probably a lot of expenses?

1353
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,210
I always assumed that a guy like that,

1354
00:34:56,211 --> 00:34:57,410
not only do they have a lot of money,

1355
00:34:57,411 --> 00:35:00,560
but they burned through a lot of money
so they have to keep making a lot of

1356
00:35:00,561 --> 00:35:00,860
money.

1357
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,790
Is that true though?

1358
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:06,350
Or are we assuming everyone's Johnny
Depp and has 19 houses and buying old

1359
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:09,050
pirate ships were $30 billion.

1360
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,093
You know what I'm saying?

1361
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,380
And then just making
horrible life decisions.

1362
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,690
Like that's the same thing with,

1363
00:35:13,691 --> 00:35:16,970
with like athletes or even
comics or entertainers.

1364
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:19,160
Like if I post something
and say I post my car,

1365
00:35:19,161 --> 00:35:19,994
somebody that like,

1366
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,811
good luck bro,

1367
00:35:20,811 --> 00:35:21,970
in three years when you go broke.

1368
00:35:21,971 --> 00:35:22,400
I'm like,

1369
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:22,850
no,

1370
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:24,260
I know the bad stories.

1371
00:35:24,261 --> 00:35:25,041
I get that man.

1372
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:26,030
I'm a smart dude.

1373
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:26,840
Like I,

1374
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,280
I think I've made it this far.

1375
00:35:28,281 --> 00:35:29,031
And listen to those people.

1376
00:35:29,031 --> 00:35:30,230
They just hope you're going broke.

1377
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:30,501
No,

1378
00:35:30,501 --> 00:35:33,800
but there's that stigma of
like the 30 for 30 ESPN broke.

1379
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,340
It's like not,

1380
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,020
that's not everyone's like that man.

1381
00:35:36,021 --> 00:35:36,680
Hate to tell you.

1382
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:40,320
Not all entertainers are our fucking
rappers where we're just blowing through

1383
00:35:40,321 --> 00:35:40,711
money.

1384
00:35:40,711 --> 00:35:40,851
They,

1385
00:35:40,851 --> 00:35:41,880
it doesn't work like that.

1386
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,070
I'm in a business where it's not,

1387
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:44,461
you know,

1388
00:35:44,461 --> 00:35:45,630
it's not just like,

1389
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:46,230
you know,

1390
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:46,381
it's,

1391
00:35:46,381 --> 00:35:50,310
it's not the UFC where your average
careers a year and a half or two years,

1392
00:35:50,311 --> 00:35:51,144
you know,

1393
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:52,890
the world of podcasting,

1394
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:54,600
podcasting is a weird thing,

1395
00:35:54,601 --> 00:35:55,080
right?

1396
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:55,381
It's like,

1397
00:35:55,381 --> 00:35:55,981
what are we doing?

1398
00:35:55,981 --> 00:35:56,814
We're just talking,

1399
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:57,931
you know,

1400
00:35:57,931 --> 00:35:58,381
this is what our,

1401
00:35:58,381 --> 00:35:58,631
our,

1402
00:35:58,631 --> 00:36:01,260
our art form is shit people already do.

1403
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:02,730
You know?

1404
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:03,450
Yeah.

1405
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:03,931
That's weird.

1406
00:36:03,931 --> 00:36:04,621
If you think about it,

1407
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:05,670
it's very weird.

1408
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:06,691
You know,

1409
00:36:06,691 --> 00:36:09,630
there's no other art form
where everybody does it.

1410
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:11,083
Every what?

1411
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:12,060
Every company does it.

1412
00:36:12,061 --> 00:36:13,170
Not everybody paints.

1413
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,131
No.

1414
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:15,540
But when was the last time you painted?

1415
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:16,411
Well,

1416
00:36:16,411 --> 00:36:20,130
I paint with my son on your own was the
last time you went down to Michael's

1417
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,353
canvas?

1418
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:21,871
Never.

1419
00:36:21,871 --> 00:36:22,830
Cause I don't suck.

1420
00:36:22,831 --> 00:36:23,431
Tick.

1421
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,264
I get out.

1422
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:27,630
I can't pay for a lot of
painters that don't Suck Dick.

1423
00:36:27,631 --> 00:36:28,080
You,

1424
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,010
you'd be surprised.

1425
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:29,920
But there are,

1426
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:31,321
but I'm talking about like,

1427
00:36:31,321 --> 00:36:31,480
uh,

1428
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,780
like taking time out of
my data kind of flower,

1429
00:36:33,781 --> 00:36:36,090
the rose sexual male
painters that admire you,

1430
00:36:36,091 --> 00:36:36,960
that are listening to this.

1431
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:37,241
Right.

1432
00:36:37,241 --> 00:36:38,074
I love you guys man.

1433
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,300
Cool Bro.

1434
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,980
Paint brush in their hand
right now and they're like,

1435
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:42,480
fuck this guy.

1436
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:44,820
I'm going to paint shop with
a big old Dick in his mouth.

1437
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:45,803
Do it.

1438
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,673
Um,

1439
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,280
yeah.

1440
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:47,791
I don't know,

1441
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:48,120
man.

1442
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,120
I went with podcasts is,

1443
00:36:49,121 --> 00:36:49,531
it's weird,

1444
00:36:49,531 --> 00:36:53,160
but it's also the gateway to a,

1445
00:36:53,161 --> 00:36:58,161
an unfiltered medium where before
with TV and movies and stuff like,

1446
00:36:59,100 --> 00:36:59,401
you know,

1447
00:36:59,401 --> 00:37:00,810
with like a name,

1448
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,070
any big guy,

1449
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:02,460
um,

1450
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,180
who's who,

1451
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:03,981
I'm trying to think of a,

1452
00:37:03,981 --> 00:37:04,500
uh,

1453
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,340
like Dax Shepard,

1454
00:37:05,341 --> 00:37:05,521
right?

1455
00:37:05,521 --> 00:37:05,791
He's a,

1456
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:06,720
he's an actor.

1457
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,610
He's an actor and he has a podcast.

1458
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:08,851
Well,

1459
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:10,410
if you just watch his movies,

1460
00:37:10,411 --> 00:37:11,580
you don't know shit about him.

1461
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:11,790
Right?

1462
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:12,690
He's playing a character,

1463
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,470
but you can go on his pockets.

1464
00:37:14,471 --> 00:37:15,180
You have some toxic,

1465
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:15,900
I'll fuck.

1466
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,400
We're in a lot of the same things.

1467
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:18,241
Oh Damn.

1468
00:37:18,241 --> 00:37:19,500
He's struggling with his wife.

1469
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:20,071
God,

1470
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,150
I have the same issues.

1471
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:21,841
Oh Damn.

1472
00:37:21,841 --> 00:37:22,770
He's struggling with his kids.

1473
00:37:22,771 --> 00:37:25,080
And then you find out
where all the exact same,

1474
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:27,060
but you'd never get that
if there weren't podcasts,

1475
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:27,690
you wouldn't.

1476
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:31,110
You're not going to get that off
of ESPN interview off of 31st.

1477
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,640
You're not going to get any of that ever.

1478
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:34,290
That's my podcast and is taken over.

1479
00:37:34,291 --> 00:37:34,770
I think.

1480
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:35,070
Well,

1481
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:37,140
it's also because no one
could tell you what to do.

1482
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:40,560
You know you can have
conversations that no one can,

1483
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:41,610
no one can steer.

1484
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:42,750
No one can.

1485
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,210
There's no executives going
to come in and stop you.

1486
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:45,961
If you fuck up,

1487
00:37:45,961 --> 00:37:46,794
it's your fuck up.

1488
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:48,090
And then if you apologize,

1489
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,990
an apology that you make yourself,

1490
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:52,430
you,

1491
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:54,330
you don't feel good about what you did.

1492
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,340
You want you express remorse,

1493
00:37:56,341 --> 00:37:57,330
which I do all the time.

1494
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,070
That's the way to go though.

1495
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:00,780
Like I took a lot of shit.

1496
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:01,861
I don't want to say shit.

1497
00:38:01,861 --> 00:38:02,370
I just,

1498
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:03,240
I go and then,

1499
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:06,330
then I'll think about
something like with Novitsky,

1500
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:06,901
right?

1501
00:38:06,901 --> 00:38:08,430
I like Jeff [inaudible].

1502
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,690
I really like a metal.

1503
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,501
The onetime met him.

1504
00:38:10,501 --> 00:38:11,221
He's great dude.

1505
00:38:11,221 --> 00:38:12,300
We had a joke about it.

1506
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:14,070
The nickname,

1507
00:38:14,071 --> 00:38:14,851
the golden snitch.

1508
00:38:14,851 --> 00:38:15,480
Like good dude.

1509
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,110
Look right there.

1510
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:16,900
Right next to you.

1511
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:17,070
Oh,

1512
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:17,820
this the shirt.

1513
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:18,150
Yeah.

1514
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:18,780
Oh Dude.

1515
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:19,613
Thank you Jen.

1516
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:21,110
I will rock the shit out of that.

1517
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:21,993
I get that.

1518
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:23,460
That's pretty dope.

1519
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,110
Hold that up for the camera.

1520
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,490
Was Pretty Dope for sure.

1521
00:38:26,491 --> 00:38:28,080
Let me or Joe Design their shirts.

1522
00:38:28,081 --> 00:38:29,100
But that's a good sheriff.

1523
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,000
It's a decent shirt.

1524
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,840
I like it a lot.

1525
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,081
Yeah,

1526
00:38:31,081 --> 00:38:31,914
it's cool.

1527
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,533
Um,

1528
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,590
but like with him,

1529
00:38:34,591 --> 00:38:34,801
right?

1530
00:38:34,801 --> 00:38:36,310
Like I go off on something

1531
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,990
and then when I talked to you about it,

1532
00:38:37,991 --> 00:38:38,320
I'm like,

1533
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,970
I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings.

1534
00:38:39,971 --> 00:38:40,720
It's just like,

1535
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,553
to me it's a,

1536
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:42,131
it's a,

1537
00:38:42,131 --> 00:38:44,110
it's a gay and then,

1538
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:48,100
but when you think about like [inaudible]
he might have to deal with it in the

1539
00:38:48,101 --> 00:38:48,551
office.

1540
00:38:48,551 --> 00:38:48,911
People are like,

1541
00:38:48,911 --> 00:38:49,151
dude,

1542
00:38:49,151 --> 00:38:52,000
her shop this or gets DM this or you know,

1543
00:38:52,001 --> 00:38:52,340
I'm like,

1544
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,560
I don't want that.

1545
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:54,730
It's the last thing I want.

1546
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,270
Well you just,

1547
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:59,620
you made an error in that you thought
that he worked for Usada and he'd never

1548
00:38:59,621 --> 00:39:01,750
worked for Usada although
worked for the UFC.

1549
00:39:01,751 --> 00:39:03,760
You said he worked for the east
side and now he works with UFC,

1550
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,780
but he never really worked for Usada.

1551
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:08,860
He wasn't where the
government very closely with
[inaudible] who worked for the

1552
00:39:08,861 --> 00:39:11,320
UFC where for the UFC and
he brought over to the UFC.

1553
00:39:11,321 --> 00:39:13,780
Now he know he coordinated the UFC.

1554
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:16,630
He's meeting with Usada
and he put it all together.

1555
00:39:16,631 --> 00:39:21,631
He's the vice president of
us of a athletes' safety,

1556
00:39:21,731 --> 00:39:22,630
health and safety's.

1557
00:39:22,631 --> 00:39:22,811
I would,

1558
00:39:22,811 --> 00:39:24,670
it is something like that for the UFC.

1559
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:28,120
That's what he's always had that before
that he worked for the government.

1560
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:29,050
Yes,

1561
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:29,461
but he,

1562
00:39:29,461 --> 00:39:31,370
he's worked hand in hand with Usada.

1563
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:32,950
Not as an employee,

1564
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,750
but he never worked for Usada.

1565
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:35,021
No,

1566
00:39:35,021 --> 00:39:35,854
he's never worked with,

1567
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,210
he went from,

1568
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:39,010
I think he was working for the IRS.

1569
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:41,703
Pretty sure.

1570
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,000
Mm.

1571
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,360
Yeah.

1572
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,230
My point was,

1573
00:39:44,231 --> 00:39:44,381
yeah,

1574
00:39:44,381 --> 00:39:44,770
he's not,

1575
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:45,460
he's never got it.

1576
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,320
I don't know if he's ever
gotten a check from the Sada,

1577
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,880
but he's been in cahoots with them.

1578
00:39:48,881 --> 00:39:50,890
They worked hand in hand.

1579
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,700
FDA.

1580
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:52,210
FDA.

1581
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:52,800
That's it.

1582
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,590
Yeah.

1583
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:55,330
That's when he wasn't at his job.

1584
00:39:55,331 --> 00:39:56,080
Lance Armstrong,

1585
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:56,770
right?

1586
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:57,603
Yeah.

1587
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:59,490
Every time I talked to Novitsky,

1588
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,740
I get text messages from land.

1589
00:40:00,741 --> 00:40:02,740
So I'm sure it makes sense though.

1590
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:03,011
Right?

1591
00:40:03,011 --> 00:40:04,000
So salty.

1592
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:04,863
Why wouldn't you be,

1593
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:05,990
I mean you kidding me?

1594
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:06,790
Wow.

1595
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:08,590
I see why he would be salty.

1596
00:40:08,591 --> 00:40:09,424
But I also,

1597
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:11,170
he has to accept,

1598
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:14,740
I think that he did some things
that he shouldn't have done.

1599
00:40:14,741 --> 00:40:16,450
And I'm not even just
talking about the steroids.

1600
00:40:16,451 --> 00:40:19,570
I'm talking about suing the people
that came out and said that he took the

1601
00:40:19,571 --> 00:40:19,830
stairs.

1602
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:23,650
That's where he's fucked up
because just doing pds in uh,

1603
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:25,090
in a cycling dirty,

1604
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,680
don't give a fuck.

1605
00:40:26,681 --> 00:40:27,211
Do it bro.

1606
00:40:27,211 --> 00:40:28,120
And you're the best at it.

1607
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,310
He's still would have been the
best of the level playing field.

1608
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:31,203
I think so too.

1609
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:31,870
So,

1610
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:35,950
but the way he fucked up his use mean
and bullied the people that we're trying

1611
00:40:35,951 --> 00:40:37,780
to snitch on him or,

1612
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:40,600
or if they weren't into the pds or
if they were going to tell on him,

1613
00:40:40,601 --> 00:40:41,440
he kind of fucked them over.

1614
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:44,200
That's where it gets dark and
that's where people hate them.

1615
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:45,100
So I get that.

1616
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:47,110
But in his defense,

1617
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,780
and then this is a shaky defense.

1618
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:52,180
They went after those
people to get to him.

1619
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:55,010
They went after those people and
they broke those people down there,

1620
00:40:55,011 --> 00:40:59,860
made those people rat on him and then he
was threatening them with lawsuits sort

1621
00:40:59,861 --> 00:41:01,120
of to protect himself.

1622
00:41:01,121 --> 00:41:02,200
But even before that,

1623
00:41:02,201 --> 00:41:02,531
right,

1624
00:41:02,531 --> 00:41:03,150
I did there,

1625
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:05,890
there's a little bit of a
bully culture coming from him,

1626
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:08,470
which is why everyone
competitors a mean guy,

1627
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:09,491
you know,

1628
00:41:09,491 --> 00:41:10,890
a lot of like most people are.

1629
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:11,201
Yeah,

1630
00:41:11,201 --> 00:41:11,650
you're right.

1631
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:12,490
You're right about that.

1632
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:15,280
I was just talking about this
the other day and it in this,

1633
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,950
Tj Dillashaw is a great
guy and he fight Saturday,

1634
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:18,940
um,

1635
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:19,773
great guy,

1636
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:20,703
but he's mean,

1637
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:21,850
correct.

1638
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:22,683
Great Guy.

1639
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,160
But if you say,

1640
00:41:24,161 --> 00:41:25,060
Hey Tj,

1641
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,040
if you knock him out with a head kick,

1642
00:41:27,041 --> 00:41:28,240
his family won't eat tonight.

1643
00:41:28,241 --> 00:41:29,380
In order for you to win this fight,

1644
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:30,880
he's going to knock you
out with a head kick.

1645
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,100
He's the most ultra
competitive guy in the world

1646
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:36,440
and it shows in training
shows in practice.

1647
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:36,801
I mean,

1648
00:41:36,801 --> 00:41:38,690
he's a nasty motherfucker.

1649
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,141
Do you know him?

1650
00:41:39,141 --> 00:41:41,090
He was 135 pounds right now.

1651
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:41,540
Oh yeah.

1652
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,373
He's ready to go.

1653
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:46,320
But he got his body down to 135
pounds before the weight cut.

1654
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:47,000
It's Craig.

1655
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,530
He looks so thin freak.

1656
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:52,010
I saw him on ESPN last night
and they were discussing it.

1657
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:55,160
He might fight Max or he
wants to fight Max next.

1658
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:57,680
He wants to fight one 45 after this.

1659
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:02,681
But that's a 20 pound jumping weight and
Max is a giant 45 or that's a bad idea.

1660
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,220
But you never know what Tj,

1661
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:04,521
hey,

1662
00:42:04,521 --> 00:42:08,540
who knows mean if he can get
his body up to one 65 dude,

1663
00:42:08,541 --> 00:42:09,440
have you seen the Henry?

1664
00:42:09,441 --> 00:42:12,260
So Hutto jacked Pico,

1665
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:13,950
Pico pose.

1666
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:14,541
Just kidding.

1667
00:42:14,541 --> 00:42:15,530
He's gonna clear the test.

1668
00:42:15,531 --> 00:42:16,221
I'm just joking around,

1669
00:42:16,221 --> 00:42:18,020
but he looks like he's pulsing.

1670
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:18,291
Yeah.

1671
00:42:18,291 --> 00:42:19,790
He might not make weight.

1672
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:22,250
He's Jack City,

1673
00:42:22,251 --> 00:42:22,970
Bro.

1674
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:23,181
Yeah.

1675
00:42:23,181 --> 00:42:24,620
I don't know if he's
going to make the weight.

1676
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:24,920
Oh,

1677
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,760
I bet he makes it.

1678
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,713
I bet he's never,

1679
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,140
he's missed a bunch of times Henry.

1680
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:29,660
So who Hutto at one 25?

1681
00:42:29,661 --> 00:42:30,320
Yes.

1682
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,250
That's why they made him
fight at one 35 for a while.

1683
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:34,543
Uh,

1684
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,860
while you do doing your
shit a bunch though.

1685
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:37,783
More than once.

1686
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:38,780
Yeah,

1687
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:39,613
that's a problem.

1688
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:40,613
Look at him.

1689
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:41,720
Looks pretty stacked.

1690
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,491
Could look in,

1691
00:42:43,491 --> 00:42:44,211
kiss it thick,

1692
00:42:44,211 --> 00:42:44,750
dude.

1693
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:45,600
He's a short dude.

1694
00:42:45,601 --> 00:42:45,861
Didn't that?

1695
00:42:45,861 --> 00:42:48,080
He's probably walking around at

1696
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:54,110
more than 45 I would say it's
more than 40 and he's so short.

1697
00:42:54,111 --> 00:42:54,944
I don't know.

1698
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:55,650
Yeah,

1699
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:58,220
I still think he's more
than a hundred years.

1700
00:42:58,230 --> 00:42:59,090
That's a tough life.

1701
00:42:59,091 --> 00:43:02,120
If you're that short and
you're not an Olympic champion,

1702
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:02,690
UFC,

1703
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:03,140
right?

1704
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:05,120
Like I was looking at him
the other day in a video.

1705
00:43:05,121 --> 00:43:05,251
I'm like,

1706
00:43:05,251 --> 00:43:05,601
God damn,

1707
00:43:05,601 --> 00:43:06,350
he's dying.

1708
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:08,420
What does e five two five two five,

1709
00:43:08,421 --> 00:43:11,450
three I'm only five inches away from that.

1710
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:12,920
I'm barely five inches.

1711
00:43:12,921 --> 00:43:17,240
That's a lifetime for those five inches
in which money they would pay to have

1712
00:43:17,241 --> 00:43:17,991
five inches.

1713
00:43:17,991 --> 00:43:18,591
They do pay.

1714
00:43:18,591 --> 00:43:19,460
Do you ever see what they do?

1715
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:22,770
They stretch your bones where they
break them and then extend to,

1716
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:25,340
do you know how crazy you have
to be to get your shins extended?

1717
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:26,830
They cut your shins,

1718
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:31,760
they saw into you and then they put this
metal brace all around you like a halo

1719
00:43:31,761 --> 00:43:32,594
brace,

1720
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:35,290
and then you crank it
a little bit of click,

1721
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:36,831
click,

1722
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:37,161
click,

1723
00:43:37,161 --> 00:43:39,020
because you have a couple inches taller.

1724
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:40,460
Come on Bro.

1725
00:43:40,461 --> 00:43:41,031
For what?

1726
00:43:41,031 --> 00:43:41,240
So,

1727
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,350
so it's an ego thing.

1728
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:42,711
No.

1729
00:43:42,711 --> 00:43:43,610
So you can get laid.

1730
00:43:43,611 --> 00:43:45,590
I was watching this
documentary on Chinese guys.

1731
00:43:45,591 --> 00:43:46,430
This guy was like,

1732
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:48,990
he had these braces on
his leg and he's like my,

1733
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:50,270
my girlfriend,

1734
00:43:50,271 --> 00:43:51,104
she,

1735
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:51,351
she,

1736
00:43:51,351 --> 00:43:51,541
no,

1737
00:43:51,541 --> 00:43:54,320
she wouldn't marry me
because I'm too short,

1738
00:43:54,321 --> 00:43:57,950
but I'm going to come to her and I'm
going to be over five feet tall for the

1739
00:43:57,951 --> 00:44:00,630
first time to use it
under five feet tall kid.

1740
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:01,940
Another girl.

1741
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:02,870
Fuck that Hoe.

1742
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:04,580
It's hard to get a girl
when you're four nine.

1743
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:07,400
The biggest problem is
if you have a short deck.

1744
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:08,811
Yeah.

1745
00:44:08,811 --> 00:44:10,580
But the biggest problem is if you're four,

1746
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:11,030
nine D,

1747
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:12,290
they don't wanna see your Dick.

1748
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:13,821
Oh Jesus.

1749
00:44:13,821 --> 00:44:14,654
Look at this guy.

1750
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:17,750
He went from five or to
say he getting six inches.

1751
00:44:17,751 --> 00:44:17,991
Five,

1752
00:44:17,991 --> 00:44:18,920
six to six foot.

1753
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:19,461
Okay,

1754
00:44:19,461 --> 00:44:20,300
let me see this.

1755
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,330
Oh God.

1756
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:21,991
He was a thick,

1757
00:44:21,991 --> 00:44:22,910
he on the low gain,

1758
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:25,520
six inches from stretching.

1759
00:44:25,521 --> 00:44:26,960
It's fucking bones out.

1760
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:28,220
Let me see what it says there.

1761
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:29,930
How unhappy do you have
to be with your body?

1762
00:44:29,931 --> 00:44:30,764
Go up there.

1763
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:32,040
Nip Tuck,

1764
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:32,700
grow.

1765
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:33,451
Five foot,

1766
00:44:33,451 --> 00:44:36,480
six inch man underwent
astonishing leg length.

1767
00:44:36,481 --> 00:44:39,120
Any procedure because he
wanted to be six foot tall.

1768
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:39,751
Oh,

1769
00:44:39,751 --> 00:44:44,751
he started at five six and he
got up to six feet tall us.

1770
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:48,360
But how fucking damaging is that?

1771
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:48,991
Well,

1772
00:44:48,991 --> 00:44:53,991
how we see the procedure in which both
legs are broken then slowly stretched

1773
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:57,420
bears more than a little
resemblance to medieval torture.

1774
00:44:57,421 --> 00:45:00,330
Let me see what this fucking
guy did too is oh my God.

1775
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,800
Oh my God.

1776
00:45:01,801 --> 00:45:03,390
It has to be some mental health issue.

1777
00:45:03,391 --> 00:45:03,820
Yeah.

1778
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:03,990
Oh,

1779
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:05,540
a little bit about the Trent.

1780
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:05,701
Well,

1781
00:45:05,701 --> 00:45:07,410
maybe if you wanted to
really play football,

1782
00:45:07,411 --> 00:45:12,090
the trend for Ling Leong limb lengthening
surgery swept China where minimum

1783
00:45:12,091 --> 00:45:15,930
heights are often quoted on personal
adverts and job advertisement says the

1784
00:45:15,931 --> 00:45:18,390
country opened up to
the west a decade ago.

1785
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:20,550
Look at that fucking thing on his leg,

1786
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:21,384
man.

1787
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:22,710
Oh my God.

1788
00:45:22,711 --> 00:45:24,060
So his,

1789
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:25,770
we're looking at here,

1790
00:45:25,771 --> 00:45:28,980
it looks like they stick
cut an inch out of his bone,

1791
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:33,180
but then they have this
bar that runs through it.

1792
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:37,500
So that's his femur mad
dude that the IP leg bone,

1793
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:38,700
that's not even his shin.

1794
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:43,610
How do you think he's going to feel when
he's 70 that can't be good for what?

1795
00:45:43,611 --> 00:45:47,400
To be five inches taller to get a skill.

1796
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:49,980
You know what chicks dig
over height skill man.

1797
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,313
Funny.

1798
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,460
Get a fucking ah,

1799
00:45:53,461 --> 00:45:56,580
650 leg lengthening
procedures in West Palm Beach,

1800
00:45:56,581 --> 00:45:57,414
Florida.

1801
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,390
Not all to remedy deformity.

1802
00:46:00,391 --> 00:46:01,710
Some of them to remedy deformities.

1803
00:46:01,711 --> 00:46:02,544
Which makes sense.

1804
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:06,000
Now how long do you think it takes for
them to fucking recover from something

1805
00:46:06,001 --> 00:46:06,720
like that?

1806
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:07,590
A lifetime.

1807
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:08,461
Oh,

1808
00:46:08,461 --> 00:46:09,860
they kind of height dysphoria.

1809
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:12,000
So it's sorta like
Anorexia with their height.

1810
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:13,080
It's a mental disorder.

1811
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:13,890
Oh,

1812
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:17,400
it's one of the few psychiatric disorders
that you can actually cure with the

1813
00:46:17,401 --> 00:46:19,350
knife says the surgeon.

1814
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,131
Oof what?

1815
00:46:20,131 --> 00:46:22,230
US as the surgeon trying
to sell this bullshit.

1816
00:46:22,231 --> 00:46:25,260
Doctor uses the term night for you
don't really use it on a knife,

1817
00:46:25,261 --> 00:46:25,530
bro.

1818
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:26,510
Don't you have a scalpel?

1819
00:46:26,511 --> 00:46:27,690
And I ain't going to that guy.

1820
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:28,621
What I can cure.

1821
00:46:28,621 --> 00:46:31,620
What the saw it costs 85 grand.

1822
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:32,990
Look what it says he does here.

1823
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:35,130
It's 30 surgery is not
for the fainthearted.

1824
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:36,780
The leg bone is broken into.

1825
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:41,870
The doctor then implants a state of the
art telescopic rod into the cartilage of

1826
00:46:42,721 --> 00:46:43,261
the bone,

1827
00:46:43,261 --> 00:46:46,920
which then pulls it apart very gradually.

1828
00:46:46,921 --> 00:46:48,810
One millimeter a day.

1829
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:54,170
New living bone grows along it to
fill the gap and muscles or in nerves.

1830
00:46:55,171 --> 00:46:57,300
The arteries is skin
also renew themselves.

1831
00:46:57,301 --> 00:46:58,560
The cost is prohibitive.

1832
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:01,200
$85,000 takes at least
three months to complete.

1833
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:04,020
Grueling physical therapy is essential.

1834
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:04,470
Ah,

1835
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:05,303
look at that one.

1836
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:07,440
Look at the gap and it's fucking leg.

1837
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:12,500
Look how big that gap you can play in
any slower walking up that kind of like

1838
00:47:13,171 --> 00:47:13,760
kicking him.

1839
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:13,930
Yeah,

1840
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:14,700
I was just thinking that.

1841
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:15,450
Oh,

1842
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:16,890
imagine if he decides to do Moitai.

1843
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,180
I betcha his um,

1844
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:22,050
like where your leg is
vulnerables changed,

1845
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:22,711
right?

1846
00:47:22,711 --> 00:47:22,891
Dude,

1847
00:47:22,891 --> 00:47:25,460
if your girl geometry core leg is like,

1848
00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:25,991
if you,

1849
00:47:25,991 --> 00:47:27,660
if your leg is a certain,

1850
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,800
like your bones are certain wit,

1851
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:30,070
I

1852
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:31,570
would imagine there's like a,

1853
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:36,970
like it all make sense pretty
much in terms of like mathematics,

1854
00:47:36,971 --> 00:47:40,390
like how long your knee is
or how long your femur is.

1855
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:42,190
It would be a certain thickness,

1856
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:43,810
but then if you spread it out,

1857
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,270
it's like the thickness of a shorter one.

1858
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:49,410
But now it's long and
it's probably more safe.

1859
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:51,850
Like stilt that make
me tell our community.

1860
00:47:51,851 --> 00:47:52,684
I just found,

1861
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:53,920
oh wow.

1862
00:47:53,921 --> 00:47:57,760
There's a whole trick deduction to
leg lengthening and frequently asked

1863
00:47:57,761 --> 00:47:58,241
questions.

1864
00:47:58,241 --> 00:47:59,260
Holy Shit.

1865
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:00,640
There's only 30 posts though,

1866
00:48:00,641 --> 00:48:01,474
dude,

1867
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:02,633
that's just that.

1868
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:03,580
Thank you.

1869
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:05,410
This one's got 300 posts.

1870
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,570
This is 3000 posts down here.

1871
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:10,170
Diary on a ton though of a,

1872
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:14,730
I'd be more worried about
lengthening those guys.

1873
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:16,420
Is there a lengthening Dick Community?

1874
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:17,590
Fuck yeah.

1875
00:48:17,591 --> 00:48:18,101
You know what they do?

1876
00:48:18,101 --> 00:48:18,760
They're all age.

1877
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:20,560
They hang weights on how dare you.

1878
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:21,101
What?

1879
00:48:21,101 --> 00:48:21,880
Racist?

1880
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:22,330
No,

1881
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:23,070
it's life.

1882
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:25,120
It's got to be some Asians
with giant dogs out there.

1883
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:28,000
I feel like we'd know about it.

1884
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:29,050
Right?

1885
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:29,351
Cause that,

1886
00:48:29,351 --> 00:48:29,441
yeah,

1887
00:48:29,441 --> 00:48:31,060
it'd be flaunting his shit.

1888
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:36,940
Make me longer community then or make me
a bigger cock community because there's

1889
00:48:36,941 --> 00:48:37,120
death,

1890
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:39,250
there's procedure you can
do like to cut it right?

1891
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:39,941
Just Google.

1892
00:48:39,941 --> 00:48:41,140
How do I get a bigger cock?

1893
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:42,550
So that's the thing.

1894
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:44,940
[inaudible]

1895
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:45,640
porn site.

1896
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:50,640
There's the pumps because the pump
man you like if you everybody,

1897
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:54,880
if it was something that really worked,

1898
00:48:54,881 --> 00:48:55,900
everybody would know about it.

1899
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:57,220
Yeah.

1900
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:58,060
Fuck you out there.

1901
00:48:58,061 --> 00:48:59,230
Would you want any room?

1902
00:48:59,231 --> 00:49:00,460
You walked in with a
bunch of dudes be like,

1903
00:49:00,461 --> 00:49:00,701
dude,

1904
00:49:00,701 --> 00:49:02,020
you see that new fucking device.

1905
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:03,370
Get Your Dick Bigger.

1906
00:49:03,371 --> 00:49:03,971
Everybody.

1907
00:49:03,971 --> 00:49:06,250
Once he devices and Dick's,

1908
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,680
those two words don't go
together like a device.

1909
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:10,810
I think I'm like clamps and screws.

1910
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:13,270
If you ever seen a penis
place like from Austin Powers,

1911
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:14,021
I've seen one.

1912
00:49:14,021 --> 00:49:17,530
I've never seen one in person like being
used like with a blown up Dickinson.

1913
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,060
I've never seen it being used,

1914
00:49:19,061 --> 00:49:22,240
but I've seen one in person and it's very,

1915
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:23,710
I mean it's intense dude.

1916
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,980
I've heard that some guys
like especially old fellows,

1917
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:27,691
they use one.

1918
00:49:27,691 --> 00:49:29,950
Then penis pumps to just get hard ons.

1919
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:30,600
Oh yeah.

1920
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:31,810
That it's attached to them.

1921
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:32,180
No,

1922
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:32,330
they,

1923
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:32,690
they,

1924
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:33,550
they have that too.

1925
00:49:33,551 --> 00:49:35,500
Like that was in Liberace and the um,

1926
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:40,240
Candelabra Oh I love that movie when we
sell getting his bag and Matt Damon 24,

1927
00:49:40,241 --> 00:49:40,630
seven,

1928
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:42,280
I think it was like how do you stay hard?

1929
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:43,270
Oh that's right.

1930
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:44,410
Got An implant.

1931
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,131
That's right.

1932
00:49:45,131 --> 00:49:45,580
Yeah.

1933
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:46,930
Do that movie so good.

1934
00:49:46,970 --> 00:49:48,220
That's a crazy movie man.

1935
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:50,530
That'd be a weird movie to
make if you're Matt Damon.

1936
00:49:50,531 --> 00:49:51,131
Cause they're like,

1937
00:49:51,131 --> 00:49:52,180
he talks about it too.

1938
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:53,620
There's a scene where,

1939
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:54,483
spoiler,

1940
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:58,660
there's a scene where he's in a speedo
and Michael Douglas is just like laying

1941
00:49:58,661 --> 00:50:01,870
down in the pool and he has
straddles him and just full on,

1942
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:02,660
ah,

1943
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:03,090
ah,

1944
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:03,310
just,

1945
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:03,790
you know,

1946
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:05,860
Matt Damon Straight as shit
to playing the character.

1947
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:06,970
That'd be tough though.

1948
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:09,970
Like if Hollywood came to me was like,

1949
00:50:09,971 --> 00:50:10,211
Brennan,

1950
00:50:10,211 --> 00:50:11,860
we need you to play the new Batman,

1951
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:15,850
but you got to go add it with
the joker mouth to mouth.

1952
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:17,740
And you guys are bumpy is in the movie.

1953
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:18,431
Yeah.

1954
00:50:18,431 --> 00:50:18,911
You'd be like,

1955
00:50:18,911 --> 00:50:19,311
yeah,

1956
00:50:19,311 --> 00:50:20,410
it'd be a little bit of a struggle.

1957
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:21,340
That's a hard pass.

1958
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:22,563
But how much you say,

1959
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:24,820
do you think you could live
in Las Vegas like that?

1960
00:50:24,821 --> 00:50:27,040
Do you think you'd do a
residency in Las Vegas?

1961
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:27,470
No.

1962
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:28,710
Like it would if they offered you the,

1963
00:50:28,711 --> 00:50:29,050
the,

1964
00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:31,670
the big brown boom boom room,

1965
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:33,880
boom,

1966
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:34,460
boom.

1967
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:35,540
Like a fucking,

1968
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:37,520
what is it at Mandalay bay.

1969
00:50:37,521 --> 00:50:40,760
Like Jay Leno type of shit
getting 30 million a year.

1970
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:41,090
Yeah,

1971
00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:42,200
something crazy like that.

1972
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:43,850
Like a Britney Spears type deal?

1973
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:44,811
I don't think so.

1974
00:50:44,811 --> 00:50:44,941
I,

1975
00:50:44,941 --> 00:50:45,101
I'm,

1976
00:50:45,101 --> 00:50:45,660
I'm,

1977
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:46,130
I,

1978
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:47,420
and this is different for me.

1979
00:50:47,450 --> 00:50:48,460
I have such a,

1980
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:51,230
a stressful connotation when it goes,

1981
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:52,161
comes to Vegas,

1982
00:50:52,161 --> 00:50:52,860
cause a fighting.

1983
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:55,190
It's whenever I think of
things I think of stress,

1984
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:55,791
stress,

1985
00:50:55,791 --> 00:50:56,270
stress.

1986
00:50:56,270 --> 00:51:00,350
So as soon as I land in Vegas I get all
introverted and I searched sweating.

1987
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:02,900
It's just not because I've
done so much work there.

1988
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,690
I was on the ultimate fighter
there for eight weeks,

1989
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:06,321
you know,

1990
00:51:06,321 --> 00:51:07,700
I've had some huge fights there.

1991
00:51:07,701 --> 00:51:09,350
So for me when I think of Vegas,

1992
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:11,240
I think of k like stressful,

1993
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:12,050
stressful,

1994
00:51:12,050 --> 00:51:12,883
Don Jr.

1995
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:13,610
Yeah.

1996
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:16,460
So it'd be tough for me to live there for,

1997
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:18,830
that'd be really tough.

1998
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:19,281
It goes,

1999
00:51:19,281 --> 00:51:21,500
people do residency for like two years.

2000
00:51:21,530 --> 00:51:22,363
Could you do it?

2001
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:23,713
I don't know.

2002
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:25,243
Um,

2003
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:26,510
I don't think I could.

2004
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:31,670
Well I think the thing about Vegas
is you got to not live in Vegas.

2005
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,790
Like you don't want to have like a,

2006
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:37,940
a suite at Mandalay bay
or something like that.

2007
00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:41,390
I think the move is to live in like
Henderson or something like that.

2008
00:51:41,391 --> 00:51:43,130
Like by red rocks or,

2009
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:43,521
yeah,

2010
00:51:43,521 --> 00:51:44,420
one of those places.

2011
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:46,220
And you just drive in.

2012
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:47,500
I think that's the move.

2013
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,070
Cause then you're just living in a town,

2014
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:50,960
well not even a big town.

2015
00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:51,231
See,

2016
00:51:51,231 --> 00:51:52,700
I would say fuck all that noise.

2017
00:51:52,701 --> 00:51:53,660
And I probably,

2018
00:51:53,661 --> 00:51:55,220
if they offered me 30 million,

2019
00:51:55,430 --> 00:52:00,430
I'd probably hire a bill burr fucking
helicopter pilot type of dude.

2020
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:03,290
And I'd live in La and just
fly out there on Fridays.

2021
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:05,000
I think it's a long flight.

2022
00:52:05,570 --> 00:52:09,170
No helicopter doesn't toss to
something like that are used to it.

2023
00:52:09,171 --> 00:52:10,040
When he was going there,

2024
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:12,410
he would just flying in for
like Friday night on a plane.

2025
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:13,760
That 25 minute flight.

2026
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:14,150
It is.

2027
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:14,301
What,

2028
00:52:14,301 --> 00:52:15,350
was he doing that a lot?

2029
00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:16,320
Yeah,

2030
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:16,760
he was,

2031
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:17,500
he was for awhile.

2032
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:18,680
Right Saturday or something like that.

2033
00:52:18,681 --> 00:52:19,520
They might stay the night,

2034
00:52:19,521 --> 00:52:22,370
but they'd be back within 36
hours or something like that.

2035
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:23,090
I can,

2036
00:52:23,090 --> 00:52:23,990
I cannot live there,

2037
00:52:23,991 --> 00:52:24,824
man.

2038
00:52:25,130 --> 00:52:29,570
There's no way just because of your past
experience that and just in general.

2039
00:52:29,571 --> 00:52:30,500
It's just not for me.

2040
00:52:30,501 --> 00:52:32,060
It's not my type of living cause or a,

2041
00:52:32,061 --> 00:52:35,450
Ralphie may had a residency there
for awhile and he was doing it,

2042
00:52:35,451 --> 00:52:36,410
but that's where he died.

2043
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:39,680
I know Eddie Griffin has a residency.

2044
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:42,170
Dice had a residency there for awhile to,

2045
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:43,400
Seinfeld did too.

2046
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,510
I think he said he'll does.

2047
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:44,691
Yeah,

2048
00:52:44,691 --> 00:52:45,524
he was making films.

2049
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:46,750
Yeah.

2050
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:47,080
Really?

2051
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:47,913
Yeah.

2052
00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:49,183
It's just,

2053
00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:51,470
there's a lot of great stuff there,

2054
00:52:51,471 --> 00:52:51,711
right?

2055
00:52:51,711 --> 00:52:52,910
Like what do you like to do?

2056
00:52:52,911 --> 00:52:54,170
Do you like to go to restaurants?

2057
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:55,430
Great restaurants.

2058
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:56,001
What do you like to do?

2059
00:52:56,001 --> 00:52:58,400
Do you like to go to the movie
theater and there's plenty of movies.

2060
00:52:58,670 --> 00:52:59,451
Great shows.

2061
00:52:59,451 --> 00:52:59,601
Yeah,

2062
00:52:59,601 --> 00:53:00,740
there's plenty of gyms,

2063
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:02,420
amazing places to work out.

2064
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:04,010
There's a lot of stuff there.

2065
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:04,461
I just,

2066
00:53:04,461 --> 00:53:05,330
I don't know man.

2067
00:53:05,331 --> 00:53:05,810
I know,

2068
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:06,171
I know what,

2069
00:53:06,171 --> 00:53:06,861
that's what I'm saying.

2070
00:53:06,861 --> 00:53:08,040
It's like sweat and talking about,

2071
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:08,851
I don't know what it is.

2072
00:53:08,851 --> 00:53:09,350
I just,

2073
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:13,760
I guess I have some great friends who
live in Vegas and some of the best people

2074
00:53:13,761 --> 00:53:14,960
I know live in Vegas.

2075
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:17,580
Some of the best people I
know work in the night clubs.

2076
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:18,980
You know what we need to do?

2077
00:53:19,010 --> 00:53:24,010
We need to sit down before big events
and make a youtube video where we're just

2078
00:53:24,651 --> 00:53:26,850
breaking down each event,

2079
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:30,000
like fight by fight as it comes up.

2080
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,740
I think people would really enjoy that.

2081
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,520
But you and me breaking down the,

2082
00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:34,440
the big fight.

2083
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:34,771
Yeah,

2084
00:53:34,771 --> 00:53:36,150
breaking down big events,

2085
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:36,680
you know?

2086
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:37,513
Good idea.

2087
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:38,850
Like if,

2088
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:40,230
if I didn't work for the UFC,

2089
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:45,240
I would love to go there and just like
cover the weigh ins as like a spectator

2090
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:49,420
but as as unfiltered no production
and me just talking shit.

2091
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:50,560
Yes.

2092
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:51,300
Yes.

2093
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:56,010
Like I don't like doing
the weigh ins stressful.

2094
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,920
I try to pronounce people's names,

2095
00:53:59,450 --> 00:54:00,640
Peel Troy young,

2096
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:01,793
like what the,

2097
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:03,480
they're going to be a worst job for me.

2098
00:54:03,481 --> 00:54:05,790
If you ask me to pronounce
everyone's names correctly,

2099
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:07,110
some of these Russian cats,

2100
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:11,790
they're names are off the charts and
it starts with the Russian g and a z.

2101
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,750
But you got to use a why not for me.

2102
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:14,461
It like a why,

2103
00:54:14,461 --> 00:54:15,900
like what not for me.

2104
00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:16,763
What is the name?

2105
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:17,790
Yeah.

2106
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:19,230
I have to write it out phonetically.

2107
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:21,120
How much longer you think you'd do that?

2108
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:21,960
I don't know.

2109
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:22,770
Just between me and you.

2110
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:23,370
No one's listening.

2111
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:24,210
No one's listening.

2112
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:24,990
I don't know.

2113
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:25,801
I do enjoy her.

2114
00:54:25,801 --> 00:54:26,520
Thought about it.

2115
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:27,240
Yes,

2116
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:28,073
all the time.

2117
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:32,310
The guy cut way back cause first of
all I was doing too many of them at one

2118
00:54:32,311 --> 00:54:33,960
point in time I was doing 24 a year.

2119
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:34,711
It was way too many.

2120
00:54:34,711 --> 00:54:35,550
It was like half the year.

2121
00:54:35,551 --> 00:54:40,110
I was half the weekends in the year I
was flying somewhere to go to the UFC.

2122
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:42,090
But that's when you did
international as well?

2123
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:42,391
Yeah,

2124
00:54:42,391 --> 00:54:43,224
it was too much.

2125
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:45,540
And that was before the UFC really?

2126
00:54:46,310 --> 00:54:46,920
Um,

2127
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:51,060
they started adding a bunch of people and
it took a lot of the weight off of me.

2128
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:51,870
Yeah,

2129
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:53,280
I'm sad they got rid of Jimmy Smith.

2130
00:54:53,281 --> 00:54:54,630
I think Jimmy Smith is really good.

2131
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:56,160
I think he's really good.

2132
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:58,560
But sometimes it's just not a fit.

2133
00:54:58,561 --> 00:54:59,520
Like I didn't see,

2134
00:54:59,521 --> 00:55:00,301
I didn't find him.

2135
00:55:00,301 --> 00:55:01,710
And maybe he didn't get his fair shot.

2136
00:55:01,711 --> 00:55:03,300
I think he's one of the
best companies in the world,

2137
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,070
but it never felt right.

2138
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:06,150
Maybe because he was at,

2139
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:07,530
he didn't get to do it enough.

2140
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:09,360
He's brilliant at his job,

2141
00:55:09,361 --> 00:55:10,510
but there was the,

2142
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:11,393
I just didn't,

2143
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:13,230
it never felt right to me.

2144
00:55:13,450 --> 00:55:15,480
It was like watching Joe
Montana played for the chiefs.

2145
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:16,020
Well,

2146
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:16,853
I'm selfish.

2147
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:17,581
He's my friend.

2148
00:55:17,581 --> 00:55:18,690
I was happy he was there.

2149
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:19,950
I think he's really good.

2150
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:20,611
I love Jimmy.

2151
00:55:20,611 --> 00:55:21,091
I'm not saying,

2152
00:55:21,091 --> 00:55:21,924
I think he's great.

2153
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:22,823
I think he's gonna gone.

2154
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:23,971
Whoever finds them,

2155
00:55:23,971 --> 00:55:24,541
it can be lucky,

2156
00:55:24,541 --> 00:55:25,374
but it never,

2157
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:29,790
like the writing was on the wall because
you would see DC who's amazing and I

2158
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:32,160
see Paul Felder who was
amazed that Dominick Cruz,

2159
00:55:32,550 --> 00:55:33,440
Michael Bisbing.

2160
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:34,230
It's like,

2161
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:35,820
well of course Jimmy's
not going to have a job.

2162
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:38,010
Like they're going to
use the in house guys.

2163
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:39,510
That's the direction they're going.

2164
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:40,823
Yeah,

2165
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:41,760
I guess so.

2166
00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:45,810
I wonder if he could do play by play.

2167
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:46,711
You know,

2168
00:55:46,711 --> 00:55:50,970
like when the ones in antique doesn't
want to do and it does and it does all

2169
00:55:50,971 --> 00:55:51,121
the,

2170
00:55:51,121 --> 00:55:51,810
hey Anik,

2171
00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:52,643
go home to your kids.

2172
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:54,930
Don't you have like seven daughters,

2173
00:55:54,990 --> 00:55:55,261
dude,

2174
00:55:55,261 --> 00:55:56,820
go home to your fucking kids.

2175
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:58,290
John knows I love him,

2176
00:55:58,291 --> 00:56:02,670
but I see him at Brazil and
a post like two days sleep,

2177
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:03,270
you know,

2178
00:56:03,270 --> 00:56:05,370
been on the road 19 days in a row.

2179
00:56:05,371 --> 00:56:05,551
I'm like,

2180
00:56:05,551 --> 00:56:05,731
dude,

2181
00:56:05,731 --> 00:56:06,990
go home bro.

2182
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:08,063
He can't,

2183
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:08,610
he's,

2184
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:09,540
he's the best.

2185
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,433
He's really good.

2186
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:14,280
There's not a better commentating team
in the history of combat sports when it's

2187
00:56:14,281 --> 00:56:15,960
you DC and Jon Anik,

2188
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:16,913
that's the best.

2189
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:18,120
It's fun.

2190
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:21,960
It's a fun DC's himself and he's one
of the best fighters of all time.

2191
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,033
Genetics.

2192
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,520
Very fucking good.

2193
00:56:24,521 --> 00:56:25,540
He's a brilliant dude.

2194
00:56:25,541 --> 00:56:27,100
And then you do your thing and that's,

2195
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:29,920
he's a dcs so loose too.

2196
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:31,360
Like he makes it silly.

2197
00:56:31,390 --> 00:56:32,260
He's a special dude.

2198
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:32,921
Like when,

2199
00:56:32,921 --> 00:56:33,340
uh,

2200
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:37,810
when rose knocked out a Yoni
and Jay Jackie's like thug rose,

2201
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:39,640
what you want thug rose,

2202
00:56:39,641 --> 00:56:40,031
you can't,

2203
00:56:40,031 --> 00:56:40,570
you can't,

2204
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:41,890
you can't pay for that.

2205
00:56:41,891 --> 00:56:45,040
That's natural that you either got it.

2206
00:56:45,041 --> 00:56:45,431
He don't,

2207
00:56:45,431 --> 00:56:46,480
and he hasn't yet.

2208
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:48,120
That's his future man.

2209
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:48,530
Yeah.

2210
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:49,363
At this future.

2211
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:49,751
Yeah.

2212
00:56:49,751 --> 00:56:52,150
Well that's why everybody
kind of wants him to retire.

2213
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:52,991
You know?

2214
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:56,110
That's why I think his family is kind
of pushing for him to retire and I talk

2215
00:56:56,410 --> 00:56:56,711
crazy.

2216
00:56:56,711 --> 00:56:57,191
Bob Cook,

2217
00:56:57,191 --> 00:56:57,461
he's like,

2218
00:56:57,461 --> 00:56:58,960
I'd be happy for retired right now.

2219
00:56:59,370 --> 00:56:59,600
I,

2220
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:03,830
and I don't think the UFC is going to
let him retire without facing judgment,

2221
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:04,780
the heavyweight division.

2222
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:09,010
And he certainly can retire if he
decides to [inaudible] not happening.

2223
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:09,670
You don't think so?

2224
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:10,090
Nope.

2225
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:13,390
They're gonna throw that big cause we
sit down and you sit down and make a deal

2226
00:57:13,391 --> 00:57:13,871
with the devil.

2227
00:57:13,871 --> 00:57:15,130
That Ikea thing about retiring.

2228
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:15,761
Very cool.

2229
00:57:15,761 --> 00:57:16,594
Here's the thing,

2230
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:20,680
we're going to pay you this
much to fight this monster.

2231
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:21,850
They're going to get out that Pantego.

2232
00:57:22,790 --> 00:57:23,170
Yup.

2233
00:57:23,170 --> 00:57:25,180
And then got to push
that a piece of paper.

2234
00:57:25,181 --> 00:57:26,590
Crossing's going to
have a theme every time.

2235
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:27,480
What does it look?

2236
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:28,180
Do me a favor.

2237
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:31,270
Just look at this Red
Strip steak house in Vegas.

2238
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:34,870
We're talking about 2 million pay per
view buys and this is what you would get

2239
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:36,123
separate life.

2240
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:39,040
He's probably set for life already.

2241
00:57:39,510 --> 00:57:40,560
Ah,

2242
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:43,030
he made $4 million with Derek Lewis.

2243
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:44,740
They are not sad.

2244
00:57:45,610 --> 00:57:46,910
I don't think you're set with email.

2245
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:50,240
Who knows how much you made
for Steve Bay who won't?

2246
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:51,460
Who knows how much he made.

2247
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,100
I mean,

2248
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:53,480
in a way,

2249
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:54,460
let's say after taxes,

2250
00:57:54,461 --> 00:57:58,120
10 million in the bank is
that sat not how to live.

2251
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:01,360
We let go and watch kit out.

2252
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:03,160
You weren't a gold watch,

2253
00:58:03,161 --> 00:58:03,790
bro.

2254
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:03,991
Dude,

2255
00:58:03,991 --> 00:58:05,080
that's not that crazy.

2256
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:06,700
CK has a joke and his,

2257
00:58:06,701 --> 00:58:07,330
uh,

2258
00:58:07,330 --> 00:58:09,850
his newest set about finding a cold water,

2259
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:11,240
they say solid.

2260
00:58:11,270 --> 00:58:12,340
It wasn't doing the same.

2261
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:13,390
Couldn't be more opposite.

2262
00:58:13,470 --> 00:58:14,080
Yeah.

2263
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:14,913
Yeah.

2264
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:17,320
You got a gold watch.

2265
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:18,410
Gold Watch dog.

2266
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:19,960
It's a gold Rolex.

2267
00:58:19,961 --> 00:58:22,030
The fucking Gold Rolex man.

2268
00:58:22,031 --> 00:58:22,181
See,

2269
00:58:22,181 --> 00:58:22,781
that's what I'm saying.

2270
00:58:22,781 --> 00:58:26,090
$10 million isn't going to last for
you to 10 million would last room.

2271
00:58:26,091 --> 00:58:26,891
I'm not that crazy.

2272
00:58:26,891 --> 00:58:27,571
Everyone thinks I'm crazy.

2273
00:58:27,571 --> 00:58:29,410
How long would it last
for the rest of your life?

2274
00:58:29,411 --> 00:58:31,180
Do you tell me that I'd be
set with my investments,

2275
00:58:31,181 --> 00:58:31,690
stuff like that.

2276
00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:32,523
Buy Property.

2277
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:32,981
I'd be,

2278
00:58:32,981 --> 00:58:34,060
I'd be panicking.

2279
00:58:34,270 --> 00:58:34,660
Count,

2280
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:34,781
well,

2281
00:58:34,781 --> 00:58:35,351
don't get me wrong,

2282
00:58:35,351 --> 00:58:36,970
I wouldn't stop working.

2283
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:38,260
You know what I'm saying?

2284
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:39,580
But if you wanted to stop working,

2285
00:58:39,970 --> 00:58:40,481
if you wanted to,

2286
00:58:40,481 --> 00:58:41,314
I don't know.

2287
00:58:41,470 --> 00:58:42,430
Have you ever thought about,

2288
00:58:42,431 --> 00:58:44,110
have you ever put a number
where if I get here,

2289
00:58:44,111 --> 00:58:46,270
I can chill out and
like I don't need to do,

2290
00:58:46,510 --> 00:58:48,510
I have 17 podcast,

2291
00:58:48,511 --> 00:58:49,950
I don't need to do all that word.

2292
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:52,690
I don't need to do nine sets of week at,

2293
00:58:52,770 --> 00:58:53,020
you know,

2294
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:55,030
the comedy store and get good.

2295
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:55,451
I know,

2296
00:58:55,451 --> 00:58:59,590
but what if I want to get 100% if only
he'd get up podcasts and do that if I

2297
00:58:59,591 --> 00:59:00,250
want to get good at.

2298
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:05,250
But there has to be some material
level financially where I can get to.

2299
00:59:05,461 --> 00:59:05,770
I can,

2300
00:59:05,770 --> 00:59:07,300
I can chill out on this,

2301
00:59:07,390 --> 00:59:07,771
but I'm not,

2302
00:59:07,771 --> 00:59:08,350
I'm not,

2303
00:59:08,350 --> 00:59:09,250
I'm not built that way.

2304
00:59:09,490 --> 00:59:10,820
Every morning I wake up like off,

2305
00:59:10,821 --> 00:59:11,321
fuck man,

2306
00:59:11,321 --> 00:59:12,160
we ready to get going.

2307
00:59:12,161 --> 00:59:13,000
I better get going.

2308
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:13,961
I don't,

2309
00:59:13,961 --> 00:59:14,440
um,

2310
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:17,020
I don't think about retiring
because I like what I do.

2311
00:59:17,230 --> 00:59:18,063
So I don't think,

2312
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:19,563
I don't think like,

2313
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:19,901
oh,

2314
00:59:19,901 --> 00:59:22,550
I need to have x amount of money in the
bank so I'm not going to do this very

2315
00:59:22,551 --> 00:59:22,941
much longer.

2316
00:59:22,941 --> 00:59:23,960
I'm not saying retiring,

2317
00:59:23,990 --> 00:59:27,020
I'm saying maybe cut back
on all the shit you do.

2318
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:29,150
Like all that stuff.

2319
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:34,180
I think it keeps me from going crazy to
think being active keeps me from losing

2320
00:59:34,971 --> 00:59:38,060
my marbles just around the house.

2321
00:59:38,061 --> 00:59:39,590
Just only with my demons.

2322
00:59:39,591 --> 00:59:40,424
Depressed.

2323
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:42,020
I don't think I'd ever get depressed.

2324
00:59:42,270 --> 00:59:42,970
No.

2325
00:59:42,970 --> 00:59:43,940
I get depressed if I'm not,

2326
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:45,290
if I'm not busy,

2327
00:59:45,291 --> 00:59:46,250
if I'm with my son,

2328
00:59:46,251 --> 00:59:46,581
I'm good,

2329
00:59:46,581 --> 00:59:50,060
but you leave me alone now I'm
like a Gremlin after midnight.

2330
00:59:50,061 --> 00:59:51,050
Don't leave me alone man.

2331
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:52,940
I don't like being all
by myself all the time.

2332
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:53,810
Well,

2333
00:59:53,810 --> 00:59:57,860
I have so many different
interests that have the sort of,

2334
00:59:57,861 --> 01:00:02,861
one of the patterns that I've picked
up my whole life is that I like to do.

2335
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:06,470
I find things that I like to do
when I do them as much as I can.

2336
01:00:07,130 --> 01:00:07,670
I would,

2337
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:09,320
I mean I have so many different things,

2338
01:00:09,321 --> 01:00:13,490
whether it's archery or
martial arts or I would,

2339
01:00:14,330 --> 01:00:16,310
I've joined the fucking pro pool tour.

2340
01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:17,480
I would do some see,

2341
01:00:17,481 --> 01:00:18,390
but everything your timeout,

2342
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:21,440
it would you wouldn't hear good about
too though is you're doing that with

2343
01:00:21,441 --> 01:00:24,110
friends like so your friends are the
best in the world at those things.

2344
01:00:24,111 --> 01:00:27,200
You just mentioned that his
hand in that helps having,

2345
01:00:27,230 --> 01:00:27,711
well yeah,

2346
01:00:27,711 --> 01:00:29,300
if you were alone with no friends,

2347
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:30,770
that shit is very,

2348
01:00:30,771 --> 01:00:34,430
that's what I can get a little dark if
you leave me like my brother goes on the

2349
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:37,880
road to me all the time it up then tons
of dates and when he's not with me and

2350
01:00:37,881 --> 01:00:41,150
I'm in that room all by myself
for like three or four days,

2351
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:41,541
like,

2352
01:00:41,541 --> 01:00:41,691
oh,

2353
01:00:41,691 --> 01:00:42,350
I'm not,

2354
01:00:42,350 --> 01:00:43,131
I'm not happy man.

2355
01:00:43,131 --> 01:00:44,000
I'm not doing well.

2356
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:45,170
I don't know.

2357
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:47,990
I tried something I need to talk
someone about but I don't know.

2358
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:50,930
That is a depressing thing when
you were alone on the road.

2359
01:00:51,030 --> 01:00:51,530
Um,

2360
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:56,270
I used to do those gigs on the road
with no opening act like way back in the

2361
01:00:56,270 --> 01:00:56,271
day.

2362
01:00:56,271 --> 01:00:58,670
That's when I'll do work with a local guy.

2363
01:00:58,820 --> 01:00:59,653
And it was just not,

2364
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,160
if the local guy was cool,

2365
01:01:01,310 --> 01:01:01,971
it was great.

2366
01:01:01,971 --> 01:01:03,710
We had a good old time and it was fun.

2367
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:04,640
I hope it,

2368
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:05,473
uh,

2369
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:06,411
and you know,

2370
01:01:06,411 --> 01:01:06,610
I'm,

2371
01:01:06,610 --> 01:01:06,790
I,

2372
01:01:06,790 --> 01:01:07,760
I like everybody,

2373
01:01:07,761 --> 01:01:08,660
but if,

2374
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:09,950
if I'm all set,

2375
01:01:09,951 --> 01:01:10,551
I'm friends.

2376
01:01:10,551 --> 01:01:11,540
So if you're not in my group,

2377
01:01:11,541 --> 01:01:14,420
I don't want to spend time like I'm
not going to go to eat with you.

2378
01:01:14,421 --> 01:01:15,140
I'm like,

2379
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:16,520
I'll see you at sea at the venue man.

2380
01:01:16,550 --> 01:01:18,340
Like I don't want to
get to know each other.

2381
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:19,550
I want to get to know anybody now.

2382
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:19,970
No,

2383
01:01:19,970 --> 01:01:20,803
not really.

2384
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:22,190
Your book's closed.

2385
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:23,061
It's a lot of energy,

2386
01:01:23,061 --> 01:01:23,640
man.

2387
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:25,190
You know I talked to her living.

2388
01:01:25,191 --> 01:01:27,740
So if you didn't have to work ever again,

2389
01:01:27,741 --> 01:01:28,790
what would you do with your time?

2390
01:01:28,970 --> 01:01:29,571
Like what if,

2391
01:01:29,571 --> 01:01:30,680
say you know,

2392
01:01:30,681 --> 01:01:31,370
you,

2393
01:01:31,370 --> 01:01:32,181
you hit the lottery,

2394
01:01:32,181 --> 01:01:33,470
you won $500 billion,

2395
01:01:33,471 --> 01:01:34,520
you never have to work again.

2396
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:36,380
I would still do standup in podcasting.

2397
01:01:36,381 --> 01:01:37,430
Really guaranteed.

2398
01:01:37,431 --> 01:01:38,150
Yeah.

2399
01:01:38,150 --> 01:01:38,960
If I'm not busy,

2400
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,850
like I like being stupid busy.

2401
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:41,681
Like I didn't like,

2402
01:01:41,681 --> 01:01:41,960
you know,

2403
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:43,310
Theo and I have a new podcast.

2404
01:01:43,311 --> 01:01:45,860
I didn't need to do that and
I have my show on showtime.

2405
01:01:45,861 --> 01:01:48,920
But yet you did need to do
that because I love doing it.

2406
01:01:48,921 --> 01:01:51,590
Well it's not for financial works good.

2407
01:01:51,591 --> 01:01:53,600
Like I love Theo by himself.

2408
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:55,330
Like his podcast by
himself was really good.

2409
01:01:55,350 --> 01:01:55,760
Be here,

2410
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:56,990
he's better with other people.

2411
01:01:56,991 --> 01:01:57,540
Yes.

2412
01:01:57,540 --> 01:01:59,840
Cause it's because other
people get to respond.

2413
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:01,080
How ridiculous he is.

2414
01:02:01,110 --> 01:02:05,270
So out of this world it guess
half the fun is people go,

2415
01:02:05,330 --> 01:02:09,680
what the fuck are you talking some
crazy shit at some crazy shit mean.

2416
01:02:09,890 --> 01:02:10,041
You know,

2417
01:02:10,041 --> 01:02:12,680
me and him talked about doing it but
for a long time doing the king of this

2418
01:02:12,681 --> 01:02:13,520
thing a long time.

2419
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:16,060
Then we even made the announcement
and then months later,

2420
01:02:16,061 --> 01:02:16,851
like even months later,

2421
01:02:16,851 --> 01:02:18,680
just because you know he's a busy guy.

2422
01:02:18,681 --> 01:02:21,180
I'm a busy guy and it's like
we don't need to do this.

2423
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:22,320
Are you the sting?

2424
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:24,270
He's the cause he called me,

2425
01:02:24,271 --> 01:02:24,751
he says,

2426
01:02:24,751 --> 01:02:27,750
I look all you get stung by a
bunch of bs cause I'm like swollen.

2427
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:28,770
And I called him,

2428
01:02:28,770 --> 01:02:29,041
I said,

2429
01:02:29,041 --> 01:02:30,000
it looks like he,

2430
01:02:30,350 --> 01:02:31,140
you know,

2431
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:32,430
keeps rats or something like that.

2432
01:02:32,431 --> 01:02:36,150
So I'll come the rat king and then just
stuck and then king in the sting and

2433
01:02:36,151 --> 01:02:37,350
it's been going great man.

2434
01:02:37,410 --> 01:02:38,161
It's been going great.

2435
01:02:38,161 --> 01:02:38,610
It's,

2436
01:02:38,610 --> 01:02:40,590
it's so different than
what Callen and I do.

2437
01:02:40,770 --> 01:02:41,251
And people are like,

2438
01:02:41,251 --> 01:02:42,061
oh fire the kid.

2439
01:02:42,061 --> 01:02:42,871
It's coming to an end.

2440
01:02:42,871 --> 01:02:42,991
No,

2441
01:02:42,991 --> 01:02:43,890
it's fucking not.

2442
01:02:43,950 --> 01:02:44,670
Come on.

2443
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:45,151
Foreign kids.

2444
01:02:45,151 --> 01:02:45,841
Never been bigger,

2445
01:02:45,841 --> 01:02:46,070
man.

2446
01:02:46,070 --> 01:02:47,240
He can't pay attention every month.

2447
01:02:47,241 --> 01:02:48,074
It's built to build.

2448
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:48,661
I don't know why,

2449
01:02:48,661 --> 01:02:49,740
but every month builds,

2450
01:02:49,741 --> 01:02:49,981
builds,

2451
01:02:49,981 --> 01:02:50,790
builds mean cal.

2452
01:02:50,790 --> 01:02:51,301
I'm doing great,

2453
01:02:51,301 --> 01:02:52,650
but there's the rat king.

2454
01:02:52,830 --> 01:02:53,790
That's what he looks like.

2455
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:55,380
This is a turtles.

2456
01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:58,110
Oh Dude.

2457
01:02:58,111 --> 01:02:59,010
We have a,

2458
01:02:59,190 --> 01:03:04,110
we have a segment on the show called
flaunt my aunt and people send in pictures

2459
01:03:04,111 --> 01:03:06,120
of their aunts and we wrote to him,

2460
01:03:08,030 --> 01:03:09,560
you don't show the picture online.

2461
01:03:09,570 --> 01:03:10,410
Do we?

2462
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:12,960
Sure do serve people.

2463
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:15,000
It's not all bad things like some,

2464
01:03:15,090 --> 01:03:16,980
some girl set a picture of uh,

2465
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:18,840
her uncle and she's like,

2466
01:03:18,841 --> 01:03:19,170
Yo,

2467
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:20,220
talk about my uncle.

2468
01:03:20,221 --> 01:03:21,090
So you know,

2469
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:24,480
if he always tries to be positive and I
take it down a weird road but it's great

2470
01:03:24,481 --> 01:03:27,540
or so and send a picture of
their APP from the 1950s,

2471
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:29,010
she got pretty hot.

2472
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:29,960
Uh,

2473
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:32,190
our producer Chin showed his aunt,

2474
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,110
aunt and she was hot as fuck.

2475
01:03:34,290 --> 01:03:35,820
1950s hot was different.

2476
01:03:36,090 --> 01:03:36,750
Black and white,

2477
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:37,320
mushy.

2478
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:38,970
There we are talking about
somebody who's fucking,

2479
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:41,670
and then someone's old on 75 years old,

2480
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:45,540
you guys have a nice set.

2481
01:03:45,540 --> 01:03:46,350
Where's your set?

2482
01:03:46,350 --> 01:03:49,860
Is it then the same complex where
you do a fighter and the kid?

2483
01:03:49,890 --> 01:03:50,281
No,

2484
01:03:50,281 --> 01:03:51,100
so it's a,

2485
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:53,520
it's in Santa Monica and um,

2486
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:53,940
it's,

2487
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:55,000
it's um,

2488
01:03:55,080 --> 01:04:00,080
the company that produced called Ma
Malka and they do all my showtime stuff.

2489
01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:02,970
So showtime with Brian
Dailey and those guys,

2490
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:03,970
they went,

2491
01:04:03,970 --> 01:04:06,660
we want to make it as easy as possible
because you have all these shows,

2492
01:04:06,661 --> 01:04:07,980
we don't want you driving all over.

2493
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:11,250
So they just had a very much
smaller scale in this base.

2494
01:04:11,251 --> 01:04:14,850
He did like a Joe Rogan style where they
built me set where it's kind of like my

2495
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:15,571
fantasy land.

2496
01:04:15,571 --> 01:04:19,740
So I'll have all my below the showtime
stuff there of King of the sting there.

2497
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:21,090
What's with the bumblebee colors?

2498
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:22,590
That Charlie Brown colors?

2499
01:04:22,591 --> 01:04:22,981
I don't know.

2500
01:04:22,981 --> 01:04:23,940
We have a set designer there.

2501
01:04:23,941 --> 01:04:24,121
I'm like,

2502
01:04:24,121 --> 01:04:24,331
all right,

2503
01:04:24,331 --> 01:04:26,220
well we're not huge Charlie band fans.

2504
01:04:26,221 --> 01:04:27,270
It's too on the nose.

2505
01:04:27,390 --> 01:04:28,223
Black and yellow.

2506
01:04:28,310 --> 01:04:29,400
It's like a bee sting.

2507
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:30,361
I used a little way.

2508
01:04:30,361 --> 01:04:31,350
It's too on the nose.

2509
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:31,980
Uh,

2510
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:32,700
see it's 200.

2511
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:33,181
You know what I'm saying?

2512
01:04:33,181 --> 01:04:34,390
It's very fashion conscious though.

2513
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:35,251
I'll do that stuff.

2514
01:04:35,251 --> 01:04:36,084
It drives me nuts.

2515
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:39,600
I was going to say last night
you were and you trust out,

2516
01:04:39,601 --> 01:04:40,050
man.

2517
01:04:40,050 --> 01:04:40,883
I dressed up.

2518
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:42,920
You like panel shark and fly you Peter.

2519
01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:43,650
Look for DCF.

2520
01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:44,940
Jamie looked pretty dope.

2521
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:45,991
You're on stage.

2522
01:04:45,991 --> 01:04:46,301
I looked at,

2523
01:04:46,301 --> 01:04:46,621
I looked at,

2524
01:04:46,621 --> 01:04:47,011
Brian said,

2525
01:04:47,011 --> 01:04:47,360
it's fuck.

2526
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:49,290
Look at Rogin with the swaggy tonight.

2527
01:04:49,460 --> 01:04:49,891
It's drip,

2528
01:04:49,891 --> 01:04:50,631
drip sound.

2529
01:04:50,631 --> 01:04:51,371
Wonderful trip.

2530
01:04:51,371 --> 01:04:51,970
It was good.

2531
01:04:51,970 --> 01:04:54,330
Like damn look good dude.

2532
01:04:55,110 --> 01:04:56,820
Those friends dress horrible dude.

2533
01:04:56,821 --> 01:04:58,980
They uh theos the worst dressed person.

2534
01:04:58,981 --> 01:05:00,270
I know Brian.

2535
01:05:01,410 --> 01:05:01,711
Theo.

2536
01:05:01,711 --> 01:05:05,910
Where's like those pants with like rubber
bands on the bottom of like parachute

2537
01:05:05,911 --> 01:05:06,720
pants?

2538
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:08,490
Like their mom vegan pants.

2539
01:05:08,491 --> 01:05:09,324
They're very,

2540
01:05:09,890 --> 01:05:11,040
he wears Veekan pack.

2541
01:05:11,050 --> 01:05:11,880
What does that mean?

2542
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:12,240
Did you,

2543
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,830
there's just some bullshit pants.

2544
01:05:14,270 --> 01:05:17,590
Like where's those me too moment pants.

2545
01:05:17,591 --> 01:05:19,930
Like they're just so non Alpha Male,

2546
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:20,231
you know,

2547
01:05:20,231 --> 01:05:21,640
like that's just what he wears.

2548
01:05:21,810 --> 01:05:22,540
That's his style.

2549
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:26,260
They taper down the bottom
and then there's elastic
that holds them up like six

2550
01:05:26,261 --> 01:05:27,490
inches away from his shoe.

2551
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:30,010
It's very yoga mom ish.

2552
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:30,730
And then,

2553
01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:35,730
then he wears weird shoes and then he'll
wear like Nike shoes with Reebok socks.

2554
01:05:35,741 --> 01:05:37,140
Drives me fucking nuts.

2555
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,140
That drives me nuts.

2556
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:40,110
Really nuts dude.

2557
01:05:40,150 --> 01:05:41,050
I did that the other day.

2558
01:05:41,290 --> 01:05:41,471
No,

2559
01:05:41,471 --> 01:05:46,270
you did it as I did have a pair of
converse with a pair of Adidas a and I was

2560
01:05:46,271 --> 01:05:48,310
thinking about it before I left
him like no one's gonna know.

2561
01:05:48,690 --> 01:05:48,851
Oh,

2562
01:05:48,851 --> 01:05:49,300
if I,

2563
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:50,170
Dude Jamie,

2564
01:05:50,610 --> 01:05:51,860
you come with the same like if I,

2565
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:53,290
if you did that at my school,

2566
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:55,840
you wouldn't have got out
alive by fifth period.

2567
01:05:58,180 --> 01:05:59,230
There's a word for it.

2568
01:05:59,890 --> 01:06:03,100
Mismatched PR purpose maybe.

2569
01:06:03,101 --> 01:06:03,540
I don't know.

2570
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:03,881
There's like,

2571
01:06:03,881 --> 01:06:04,840
there's like a word when you were,

2572
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:07,520
when you found that it was like an
early nineties thing I remember on it.

2573
01:06:08,050 --> 01:06:08,351
Yeah.

2574
01:06:08,351 --> 01:06:09,400
It just wasn't my thing.

2575
01:06:09,850 --> 01:06:10,683
Um,

2576
01:06:11,570 --> 01:06:11,920
yeah,

2577
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:12,301
but it's,

2578
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:12,971
it's a good time.

2579
01:06:12,971 --> 01:06:13,390
It didn't,

2580
01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:14,230
what Fiona,

2581
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:17,320
Fiona and I tried to do is
something completely different.

2582
01:06:17,321 --> 01:06:17,710
There's,

2583
01:06:17,710 --> 01:06:18,011
there's,

2584
01:06:18,011 --> 01:06:20,080
it's not like open ended conversation.

2585
01:06:20,081 --> 01:06:20,950
There's no guests.

2586
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:21,880
It's just,

2587
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:25,420
it's all segments king adjusting
it and it's all fancy emissions.

2588
01:06:25,510 --> 01:06:26,700
So people are viewing videos.

2589
01:06:26,710 --> 01:06:27,491
Go Yo,

2590
01:06:27,491 --> 01:06:28,630
Burger King or Mcdonald's.

2591
01:06:28,631 --> 01:06:30,130
I mean him debate Mcdonald's,

2592
01:06:30,131 --> 01:06:32,330
Burger King or flunk
mine sending pictures.

2593
01:06:32,331 --> 01:06:34,930
Here you have a preference to
burger king and Mcdonald's.

2594
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:36,190
I'm a Burger King Guy.

2595
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:37,390
A whopper with cheese.

2596
01:06:37,780 --> 01:06:37,961
Well,

2597
01:06:37,961 --> 01:06:39,130
I didn't say either one is healthy,

2598
01:06:39,131 --> 01:06:39,850
but they're fucking,

2599
01:06:39,850 --> 01:06:40,151
he's like,

2600
01:06:40,151 --> 01:06:40,660
Shit.

2601
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:41,980
Doing a whopper with cheese.

2602
01:06:43,210 --> 01:06:44,260
What do you like fast food?

2603
01:06:44,830 --> 01:06:47,650
You have to choose between Wendy's and
Burger King right next to each other.

2604
01:06:47,651 --> 01:06:48,460
King all day.

2605
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:49,300
Whopper with cheese.

2606
01:06:49,301 --> 01:06:50,560
Ketchup only bro.

2607
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:52,330
That's outrageous.

2608
01:06:52,450 --> 01:06:53,283
You went Wendy's.

2609
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:54,340
Of course,

2610
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:54,550
dude.

2611
01:06:54,550 --> 01:06:59,550
They're square patties you isis funds
which shapes the square patties.

2612
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:02,231
What's my script?

2613
01:07:02,231 --> 01:07:02,861
Pizza tour.

2614
01:07:02,861 --> 01:07:03,580
It's slices.

2615
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:04,360
Give a fuck.

2616
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:05,890
As long as it tastes good dude.

2617
01:07:05,930 --> 01:07:06,820
Not worried about shapes.

2618
01:07:06,821 --> 01:07:07,450
Come on Bro.

2619
01:07:07,450 --> 01:07:10,300
You're so fashion conscious that drives
me that you should have been a gay guy

2620
01:07:10,301 --> 01:07:11,560
in another life to Pri.

2621
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:12,240
Yeah,

2622
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,073
like if I get,

2623
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:14,193
that's why I stopped fighting.

2624
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:17,470
Drain a second straightness
fashion conscious guy.

2625
01:07:17,471 --> 01:07:18,251
I know I,

2626
01:07:18,251 --> 01:07:18,491
yeah,

2627
01:07:18,491 --> 01:07:19,324
I don't know why.

2628
01:07:20,020 --> 01:07:23,950
Like you're really into like looks
and fashion and trends and stuff.

2629
01:07:23,970 --> 01:07:24,370
Yeah.

2630
01:07:24,370 --> 01:07:25,240
You pay attention.

2631
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:26,950
The only guy that I know that does that,

2632
01:07:27,010 --> 01:07:30,580
I've had my outfit picked out for my
special Saturday for three weeks now.

2633
01:07:30,850 --> 01:07:31,480
Wow.

2634
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:33,100
I went through like constantly thinking,

2635
01:07:33,310 --> 01:07:34,020
constantly thinking,

2636
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:34,750
what am I going to do?

2637
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:38,650
You should have a tiger come out in a
cage like Katt Williams were the top.

2638
01:07:38,710 --> 01:07:39,220
Yeah.

2639
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:43,160
Just to go nuts and have a fur coat and
has some chicks take the fur coat off

2640
01:07:43,270 --> 01:07:44,320
when you get on stage.

2641
01:07:44,350 --> 01:07:45,640
The set's a little outrageous,

2642
01:07:46,690 --> 01:07:47,440
crazy set.

2643
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:48,340
Not Crazy,

2644
01:07:48,341 --> 01:07:48,811
but I'm like,

2645
01:07:48,811 --> 01:07:48,941
oh,

2646
01:07:48,941 --> 01:07:49,774
that's very,

2647
01:07:50,370 --> 01:07:52,070
it's very Kevin Hart hedge.

2648
01:07:52,071 --> 01:07:53,740
Like that's when they sit there.

2649
01:07:53,741 --> 01:07:53,870
They,

2650
01:07:53,870 --> 01:07:54,191
all right.

2651
01:07:54,191 --> 01:07:55,024
Well that's,

2652
01:07:55,090 --> 01:07:55,810
that'll work.

2653
01:07:55,810 --> 01:07:56,051
Yeah.

2654
01:07:56,051 --> 01:07:56,884
Excited.

2655
01:07:56,890 --> 01:07:57,071
Yeah.

2656
01:07:57,071 --> 01:07:57,910
I can't wait man.

2657
01:07:58,090 --> 01:07:59,050
That's fucking awesome.

2658
01:07:59,170 --> 01:08:00,280
I've never been more excited.

2659
01:08:00,550 --> 01:08:04,960
So the same night that you are doing
your showtime Special Tj Dillashaw is

2660
01:08:04,970 --> 01:08:06,160
fighting Henry's Hutto.

2661
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:07,380
Who else is on that card?

2662
01:08:07,390 --> 01:08:08,170
Pull that card up.

2663
01:08:08,170 --> 01:08:09,003
Good card man.

2664
01:08:09,010 --> 01:08:13,210
First card ever for ESPN plus ESPN plus.

2665
01:08:13,211 --> 01:08:15,100
So it's a streaming thing.

2666
01:08:15,650 --> 01:08:16,040
You watch

2667
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:18,770
cowboy a Serone though
on the unregular ESPN.

2668
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:19,790
He's the,

2669
01:08:19,790 --> 01:08:21,610
he's the main amount of
the regular ESPN then.

2670
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:25,130
So it's weird because the prelims
are on the digital device.

2671
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:26,750
Then it goes regular,

2672
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:27,560
uh,

2673
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:29,270
ESPN for the Donald Cerrone fight.

2674
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:31,250
Then you got switched back to the digital.

2675
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,680
It can take a little while for
people to get used to that.

2676
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:36,350
Some people are super bummed out
with my friend Brian Stevens.

2677
01:08:36,351 --> 01:08:41,351
He lives in a rural Texas outside of
Dallas and he's bummed out because his

2678
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:43,040
internet something that fast.

2679
01:08:43,430 --> 01:08:43,790
It's like,

2680
01:08:43,790 --> 01:08:44,121
you know,

2681
01:08:44,121 --> 01:08:45,740
in certain places you can't get fax,

2682
01:08:45,741 --> 01:08:46,574
Internet,

2683
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:47,413
Frilly,

2684
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:50,510
2019 he can't get Wifi.

2685
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:52,040
If you want to live on a ranch,

2686
01:08:52,310 --> 01:08:53,540
the whole live on a fucking rant.

2687
01:08:53,541 --> 01:08:55,700
You going have to get slowly ranch.

2688
01:08:55,940 --> 01:08:56,770
Fuck Bro.

2689
01:08:56,770 --> 01:08:56,920
No,

2690
01:08:56,920 --> 01:09:00,470
there's some stuff they can do some stuff,

2691
01:09:00,471 --> 01:09:01,250
right.

2692
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:01,700
Well,

2693
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:02,450
you can,

2694
01:09:02,450 --> 01:09:03,740
if you really want to be,

2695
01:09:04,780 --> 01:09:05,390
you know,

2696
01:09:05,390 --> 01:09:06,223
balling,

2697
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:07,490
you got to spend a lot of money.

2698
01:09:07,490 --> 01:09:11,180
Like it took four months for us to
get legit internet at the old place.

2699
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:13,310
They had a chew up the streets and we're,

2700
01:09:13,311 --> 01:09:13,611
you know,

2701
01:09:13,611 --> 01:09:14,444
we were in,

2702
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:15,201
you know,

2703
01:09:15,201 --> 01:09:16,460
the Canoga Park area,

2704
01:09:16,461 --> 01:09:19,370
which has all these businesses
and they legit there.

2705
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:20,263
Yeah.

2706
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:21,193
They,

2707
01:09:21,230 --> 01:09:22,250
it's a fucking,

2708
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:24,990
it's a grind to get legit
internet in some spots.

2709
01:09:25,010 --> 01:09:25,401
Oh boy.

2710
01:09:25,401 --> 01:09:26,031
Can't get it.

2711
01:09:26,031 --> 01:09:26,864
So he's bummed out it.

2712
01:09:26,930 --> 01:09:27,290
Yeah.

2713
01:09:27,290 --> 01:09:28,123
So He's,

2714
01:09:28,190 --> 01:09:28,640
you know,

2715
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:32,210
they used to be able to watch all
the good fights on a regular TV.

2716
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:33,193
So here we go.

2717
01:09:33,250 --> 01:09:34,083
Um,

2718
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:37,670
Greggor Gillespie versus Yancey Madeiros.

2719
01:09:37,671 --> 01:09:41,270
Grego Gillespie is that
guy's a fucking beast.

2720
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:42,980
Minus five 50.

2721
01:09:42,981 --> 01:09:43,521
You look at it.

2722
01:09:43,521 --> 01:09:43,701
Yeah,

2723
01:09:43,701 --> 01:09:44,534
he's us.

2724
01:09:44,570 --> 01:09:48,230
Darryl's whelming favorite look
that could be fight of the night.

2725
01:09:48,231 --> 01:09:49,670
I love how you skip over the Greg Hardy.

2726
01:09:49,730 --> 01:09:52,100
We all recognize this bullshit
and then let's keep going.

2727
01:09:52,101 --> 01:09:52,821
Is it bullshit?

2728
01:09:52,821 --> 01:09:53,001
I mean,

2729
01:09:53,001 --> 01:09:54,980
the guy's got fucking serious power.

2730
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:55,171
Well,

2731
01:09:55,171 --> 01:09:56,260
the only thing that does he,

2732
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:57,370
he's fought cans.

2733
01:09:57,371 --> 01:09:58,240
He said No.

2734
01:09:58,250 --> 01:09:59,200
So on the ESPS,

2735
01:09:59,210 --> 01:10:00,800
far cans to co main event.

2736
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:01,221
Well,

2737
01:10:01,221 --> 01:10:01,670
he's deaf.

2738
01:10:01,670 --> 01:10:01,851
Well,

2739
01:10:01,851 --> 01:10:02,690
it's because of his name.

2740
01:10:02,930 --> 01:10:03,440
He's dead.

2741
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:03,860
Well,

2742
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:04,693
Allen Crowder,

2743
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:05,720
I don't know him.

2744
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:06,733
I don't know who,

2745
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:07,040
who?

2746
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:10,700
Alan Crowder's and he's Greg Allen.

2747
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:12,920
Giant favorite 600.

2748
01:10:13,190 --> 01:10:14,023
Yeah,

2749
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:15,860
he's a minus 600.

2750
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:16,860
The wait a minute.

2751
01:10:16,861 --> 01:10:18,170
He calls himself the prince of war.

2752
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:19,070
Hey Bro.

2753
01:10:19,070 --> 01:10:19,581
Whoa.

2754
01:10:19,581 --> 01:10:19,761
No,

2755
01:10:19,761 --> 01:10:20,241
he doesn't it.

2756
01:10:20,241 --> 01:10:20,810
Yes he does.

2757
01:10:20,810 --> 01:10:21,111
Greg,

2758
01:10:21,111 --> 01:10:22,430
the print of war hardy.

2759
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:23,240
Wow.

2760
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:24,073
Don't do that.

2761
01:10:24,110 --> 01:10:25,010
Do not.

2762
01:10:25,370 --> 01:10:26,390
Absolutely.

2763
01:10:26,391 --> 01:10:27,320
Do not do that.

2764
01:10:27,321 --> 01:10:28,040
Do that.

2765
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:30,470
Decent nicknames are so bad.

2766
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:32,630
Like someone needs like a nickname coach.

2767
01:10:32,810 --> 01:10:33,860
The UFC should provide,

2768
01:10:33,861 --> 01:10:35,300
you know how they have like the athletes,

2769
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:36,740
the performance center,

2770
01:10:36,940 --> 01:10:38,410
the athletes get to go center.

2771
01:10:38,650 --> 01:10:38,840
Yeah.

2772
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:42,080
They have a niche to have a nickname
center like Greg or the Gift Gillespie.

2773
01:10:42,110 --> 01:10:43,300
That's a good name dude.

2774
01:10:43,370 --> 01:10:44,630
All the triple cheese.

2775
01:10:44,690 --> 01:10:46,220
That mother fucker can wrestle.

2776
01:10:46,490 --> 01:10:47,301
Holy Shit.

2777
01:10:47,301 --> 01:10:48,410
And he ran fish too.

2778
01:10:48,470 --> 01:10:48,981
He can fight.

2779
01:10:48,981 --> 01:10:49,131
Yeah.

2780
01:10:49,131 --> 01:10:49,780
He's a good freshman.

2781
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:50,090
Yeah.

2782
01:10:50,090 --> 01:10:50,923
Yeah.

2783
01:10:51,140 --> 01:10:53,600
So fucking serious wrestler though.

2784
01:10:53,810 --> 01:10:54,680
This is a good fight.

2785
01:10:54,710 --> 01:10:56,780
Does for veto is a good fight.

2786
01:10:56,820 --> 01:10:57,653
Yeah.

2787
01:10:57,770 --> 01:10:59,840
Did they did fight before and um,

2788
01:10:59,870 --> 01:11:00,800
Benevidez one right?

2789
01:11:00,810 --> 01:11:01,250
Yeah.

2790
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:02,540
Bellevue as a motherfucker.

2791
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:06,260
Love Benevidez glow over
to share and call Roberson.

2792
01:11:06,261 --> 01:11:07,190
That's a good fight.

2793
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:10,550
Carl Robertson is a fucking beast man.

2794
01:11:10,910 --> 01:11:11,631
Interesting nicknames.

2795
01:11:11,631 --> 01:11:12,530
He say Robertson.

2796
01:11:12,531 --> 01:11:13,080
Robertson.

2797
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:13,831
Carl Baby.

2798
01:11:13,831 --> 01:11:14,700
K Robertson.

2799
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:15,240
Yeah.

2800
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:17,010
That mother fucker can fight.

2801
01:11:17,290 --> 01:11:18,450
He is good.

2802
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:19,040
Striking.

2803
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:19,501
Very good.

2804
01:11:19,501 --> 01:11:19,651
Yeah.

2805
01:11:19,651 --> 01:11:21,810
He hurt his foot in his last fight,

2806
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:23,490
like early on.

2807
01:11:23,491 --> 01:11:25,800
But this is a big step up for him.

2808
01:11:26,060 --> 01:11:27,700
It's getting a little long in the tooth,

2809
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:29,520
a lot long in the tooth,

2810
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:30,810
but he's still tough as shit.

2811
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:32,100
If that goes to the ground,

2812
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:33,870
you could get dicey.

2813
01:11:34,230 --> 01:11:35,220
And then the next one,

2814
01:11:35,221 --> 01:11:36,600
boys get your dates out.

2815
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:40,630
Van Zandt doing Rachel almost of itch.

2816
01:11:40,990 --> 01:11:42,840
Dimey demis of all diabetes.

2817
01:11:42,870 --> 01:11:44,430
They're better looking
than the green card girls.

2818
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:49,460
Well most of which has the most rid
donkey body and her face is re she's

2819
01:11:50,491 --> 01:11:51,324
beautiful too.

2820
01:11:51,950 --> 01:11:52,590
Time.

2821
01:11:52,590 --> 01:11:53,391
She's so beautiful.

2822
01:11:53,391 --> 01:11:54,780
Her body is so ridiculous.

2823
01:11:54,781 --> 01:11:56,120
It's like are you are person?

2824
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:57,953
Yeah.

2825
01:11:58,020 --> 01:11:59,100
At risk at all for that girl.

2826
01:11:59,150 --> 01:11:59,610
Um,

2827
01:11:59,610 --> 01:12:00,443
and then you got,

2828
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:03,660
he got Paige vanzant who's,

2829
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:05,940
why does it seem one 55
she's not willing to fund.

2830
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:07,540
That's a title on UFC guys.

2831
01:12:08,070 --> 01:12:10,310
Get your fucking people on the website.

2832
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:10,611
Tam.

2833
01:12:10,611 --> 01:12:10,891
It,

2834
01:12:10,891 --> 01:12:11,701
someone's an asshole.

2835
01:12:11,701 --> 01:12:12,534
They want to make fun of her.

2836
01:12:12,690 --> 01:12:14,100
She just won 55.

2837
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:16,180
They could also do a
better picture of him.

2838
01:12:16,260 --> 01:12:17,550
Girl who works for the w,

2839
01:12:18,070 --> 01:12:23,070
the girlfriend of the web designers
ways one 55 slash 45 but she 55

2840
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:28,290
she uh,

2841
01:12:28,350 --> 01:12:28,561
yeah.

2842
01:12:28,561 --> 01:12:29,820
She's easy on the eyes too.

2843
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:30,331
Yeah,

2844
01:12:30,331 --> 01:12:31,050
she's beautiful.

2845
01:12:31,050 --> 01:12:31,560
Yeah,

2846
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:32,910
they're both gorgeous women.

2847
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:37,200
It's crazy though that most of it's coming
off of that domestic violence thing.

2848
01:12:37,290 --> 01:12:38,820
Where have you seen the video of that?

2849
01:12:38,910 --> 01:12:40,340
No disturbance.

2850
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:41,820
It's her husband saying
he's gonna kill her.

2851
01:12:43,930 --> 01:12:46,770
It's super disturbing
and if you need security,

2852
01:12:46,771 --> 01:12:47,371
Rachel,

2853
01:12:47,371 --> 01:12:48,600
I am here for you.

2854
01:12:48,601 --> 01:12:49,680
So sad.

2855
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:50,833
Um,

2856
01:12:50,970 --> 01:12:52,110
they have kids together too.

2857
01:12:52,111 --> 01:12:53,250
It's just so fucked up.

2858
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:54,630
It's super dark.

2859
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:56,760
But to put her on the
card with Greg Hardy,

2860
01:12:56,761 --> 01:12:57,720
there was a giant,

2861
01:12:57,990 --> 01:13:02,700
a lot of people criticizing that
in the UFC does not give a fuck.

2862
01:13:02,730 --> 01:13:03,150
Well,

2863
01:13:03,150 --> 01:13:06,390
the thing is that Greg
Hardy was on the card.

2864
01:13:06,391 --> 01:13:10,470
The card was set before she
got assaulted by her husband,

2865
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:12,330
so it was already in place.

2866
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:13,440
She was supposed to be on the car.

2867
01:13:13,441 --> 01:13:16,800
They pulled her from the card when they
thought that she had a broken orbital

2868
01:13:16,801 --> 01:13:17,550
bone.

2869
01:13:17,550 --> 01:13:20,730
She went to a different doctor.

2870
01:13:20,731 --> 01:13:23,700
I guess she got some actual
exams and Mris and stuff.

2871
01:13:23,701 --> 01:13:25,440
Turns out she didn't have
a broken orbital bone.

2872
01:13:25,441 --> 01:13:26,310
They cleared it a fight.

2873
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:28,560
She begged them to let her
fight because she just,

2874
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:33,390
she doesn't want this to take her out
of fighting is what meets a gigantic

2875
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:34,830
catastrophe,

2876
01:13:35,130 --> 01:13:38,370
a horrible dilemma in her life.

2877
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:41,100
It's hard not to root for
her husband hits her Pizza,

2878
01:13:41,110 --> 01:13:41,550
rob.

2879
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:42,480
It's awful.

2880
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:43,651
And she's like,

2881
01:13:43,651 --> 01:13:46,170
I'm not gonna let this Guy Stop my career.

2882
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:48,140
I'm not going to let this
guy changed the path.

2883
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:48,451
My life.

2884
01:13:48,451 --> 01:13:49,350
I'm done with him.

2885
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:50,310
I want to fight.

2886
01:13:50,310 --> 01:13:52,770
And she begged them to let
her fight and I'm just saying,

2887
01:13:52,771 --> 01:13:54,030
if I'm the UFC,

2888
01:13:54,390 --> 01:13:54,901
I go,

2889
01:13:54,901 --> 01:13:55,380
all right,

2890
01:13:55,380 --> 01:13:56,160
Greg Hardy,

2891
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:57,330
he's not a big draw.

2892
01:13:57,331 --> 01:13:57,740
He's not,

2893
01:13:57,740 --> 01:13:58,980
he's not a veteran.

2894
01:13:58,981 --> 01:14:00,090
There's nothing going on here.

2895
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:03,030
Let's just move them to any
other fucking card we have.

2896
01:14:03,450 --> 01:14:04,650
We're sensitive to this.

2897
01:14:05,030 --> 01:14:05,863
We don't Hae,

2898
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:06,750
no one's tuned in.

2899
01:14:06,751 --> 01:14:07,500
Just one.

2900
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:08,700
It's not a big deal.

2901
01:14:08,910 --> 01:14:09,721
Moving to the next call.

2902
01:14:09,721 --> 01:14:12,400
I think they want some controversy.

2903
01:14:12,910 --> 01:14:14,140
I think they like controversy.

2904
01:14:14,141 --> 01:14:18,640
I think any sort of press and they live
and die by this negative press is good

2905
01:14:18,641 --> 01:14:18,970
press.

2906
01:14:18,970 --> 01:14:20,380
We'll look at what the John Joe's thing,

2907
01:14:20,410 --> 01:14:22,090
they don't give a fuck Conor Khabib thing.

2908
01:14:22,090 --> 01:14:23,480
They kept showing him throwing the,

2909
01:14:23,481 --> 01:14:23,801
the,

2910
01:14:23,801 --> 01:14:25,480
the Dolly at the bus.

2911
01:14:25,510 --> 01:14:27,000
They kept showing it over and over again.

2912
01:14:27,070 --> 01:14:28,550
Promos until they're appointed.

2913
01:14:28,570 --> 01:14:28,810
You know,

2914
01:14:28,810 --> 01:14:29,710
it kind of works.

2915
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:30,610
Fuck cad work.

2916
01:14:30,611 --> 01:14:32,830
That was at Joe you and paper view.

2917
01:14:32,890 --> 01:14:34,660
I mean that was just,

2918
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:35,650
it works.

2919
01:14:35,650 --> 01:14:36,200
So he can't,

2920
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:36,480
yeah.

2921
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:37,540
This one's a little different.

2922
01:14:37,541 --> 01:14:40,480
Like throwing a Dolly through the window
when with other professional fighters.

2923
01:14:40,510 --> 01:14:40,751
All right.

2924
01:14:40,751 --> 01:14:41,051
Whatever.

2925
01:14:41,051 --> 01:14:41,741
I botched that.

2926
01:14:41,741 --> 01:14:43,570
I hyped that shit too with this one.

2927
01:14:43,571 --> 01:14:43,931
I can't,

2928
01:14:43,931 --> 01:14:44,750
I just can't.

2929
01:14:44,750 --> 01:14:45,280
I'm out.

2930
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:46,210
I'm not hyping it.

2931
01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:47,620
I can't get on board for it.

2932
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:47,831
Well,

2933
01:14:47,831 --> 01:14:48,670
it's not like Austin,

2934
01:14:48,671 --> 01:14:50,740
which is fighting her
boyfriend or husband.

2935
01:14:51,670 --> 01:14:52,151
It'd be cool.

2936
01:14:52,151 --> 01:14:52,984
She was,

2937
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:54,930
I think he's a fighter
that can be troublesome.

2938
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:57,393
Looks pretty jagged.

2939
01:14:57,410 --> 01:14:57,580
Yeah,

2940
01:14:57,580 --> 01:14:58,210
that's true.

2941
01:14:58,210 --> 01:14:58,900
Not Good.

2942
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:00,220
The whole thing is so ugly.

2943
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:01,353
It's tough.

2944
01:15:01,770 --> 01:15:02,620
What are the fights?

2945
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:04,030
What are the fights are cowboy.

2946
01:15:05,770 --> 01:15:08,380
Alexander Hernandez is a fucking beast.

2947
01:15:08,650 --> 01:15:10,450
That is a good fight.

2948
01:15:10,660 --> 01:15:14,980
That guy is super cocky to
Alexander the Great Hernandez.

2949
01:15:15,190 --> 01:15:17,160
He is a bad motherfucker.

2950
01:15:17,170 --> 01:15:18,280
Cowboy being cowboy.

2951
01:15:18,281 --> 01:15:20,050
Just taking a random ass fight.

2952
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:20,321
Yeah.

2953
01:15:20,321 --> 01:15:21,850
Well this is his first.

2954
01:15:22,030 --> 01:15:23,080
This is Hernandez.

2955
01:15:23,081 --> 01:15:25,180
His first fight in the big leagues.

2956
01:15:25,590 --> 01:15:25,960
Um,

2957
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:27,100
let me look at his record.

2958
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:28,180
They show his record.

2959
01:15:29,350 --> 01:15:29,531
No,

2960
01:15:29,531 --> 01:15:30,490
but I mean look at it.

2961
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:31,480
The actual fights,

2962
01:15:31,510 --> 01:15:32,530
this show who he's fought,

2963
01:15:32,950 --> 01:15:33,960
they don't have that on the web.

2964
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:35,500
He hasn't fought anyone.

2965
01:15:35,501 --> 01:15:36,650
Nowhere on your account.

2966
01:15:36,660 --> 01:15:37,493
On the website.

2967
01:15:37,690 --> 01:15:39,730
I'm on the fight card,

2968
01:15:39,731 --> 01:15:40,301
I don't believe,

2969
01:15:40,301 --> 01:15:42,640
but maybe on here guy here on his page.

2970
01:15:42,670 --> 01:15:43,330
They do.

2971
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:44,163
Wow.

2972
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:45,040
How weird.

2973
01:15:45,190 --> 01:15:45,371
I mean,

2974
01:15:45,371 --> 01:15:48,340
he'd be where you shot a dowel merciay.

2975
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:50,230
How dare you.

2976
01:15:50,231 --> 01:15:51,490
She's a motherfucker and he not,

2977
01:15:51,491 --> 01:15:52,690
he starts to him.

2978
01:15:53,110 --> 01:15:53,470
Yeah.

2979
01:15:53,470 --> 01:15:55,680
He starts Dariusz and he beat Obama.

2980
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:56,470
Rca.

2981
01:15:56,470 --> 01:15:58,330
Those are two really good fighters.

2982
01:15:58,380 --> 01:15:59,213
Yeah.

2983
01:15:59,650 --> 01:16:01,230
But the way he beat dairy,

2984
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:01,631
which I was like,

2985
01:16:01,631 --> 01:16:02,920
Holy Shit,

2986
01:16:03,340 --> 01:16:04,900
he's fast as fuck.

2987
01:16:05,410 --> 01:16:07,210
He's got serious power.

2988
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:09,610
He's really technical too.

2989
01:16:09,790 --> 01:16:11,050
And he's really hungry.

2990
01:16:11,530 --> 01:16:12,170
Like he,

2991
01:16:12,170 --> 01:16:14,900
he views his cowboy fight as
the breakout opportunities.

2992
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:15,790
A young line man.

2993
01:16:15,791 --> 01:16:15,971
Yeah,

2994
01:16:15,971 --> 01:16:16,570
he's,

2995
01:16:16,570 --> 01:16:16,781
yeah.

2996
01:16:16,781 --> 01:16:20,410
He's got real future
championship potential.

2997
01:16:20,650 --> 01:16:21,311
He's one of those guys.

2998
01:16:21,311 --> 01:16:21,820
You look at,

2999
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:22,031
you go,

3000
01:16:22,031 --> 01:16:22,660
let's see,

3001
01:16:22,660 --> 01:16:23,100
let's do this.

3002
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:25,330
Just shows with cowboy.

3003
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:26,290
It's just like,

3004
01:16:27,010 --> 01:16:28,180
um,

3005
01:16:28,210 --> 01:16:29,710
make zero sense in the world.

3006
01:16:29,711 --> 01:16:30,071
But Kevin,

3007
01:16:30,071 --> 01:16:31,090
I just want to stay active.

3008
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:32,710
He's a savage man.

3009
01:16:32,860 --> 01:16:33,730
He just loves it.

3010
01:16:34,660 --> 01:16:35,590
And you know what,

3011
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:35,951
man,

3012
01:16:35,951 --> 01:16:36,430
I mean,

3013
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:39,040
if you look at his last
fight against Perry,

3014
01:16:39,041 --> 01:16:41,380
he's still fighting smooth and smart.

3015
01:16:41,740 --> 01:16:43,550
He looked fantastic in that fight.

3016
01:16:43,551 --> 01:16:44,440
Good short work.

3017
01:16:44,441 --> 01:16:46,960
A Peri Peri is a dangerous guy.

3018
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:47,920
Powerful guy.

3019
01:16:48,250 --> 01:16:48,510
Cowboy.

3020
01:16:48,510 --> 01:16:49,420
You're going to cowboy man.

3021
01:16:49,660 --> 01:16:50,770
It's very interesting.

3022
01:16:50,830 --> 01:16:51,611
Very interesting.

3023
01:16:51,611 --> 01:16:51,970
Fine.

3024
01:16:51,970 --> 01:16:52,251
I'm,

3025
01:16:52,251 --> 01:16:52,600
I'm,

3026
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:56,240
that might be one of the fights
that I'm most curious about.

3027
01:16:56,250 --> 01:16:57,083
For sure.

3028
01:16:57,190 --> 01:16:57,840
For sure.

3029
01:16:57,840 --> 01:16:58,673
Yeah.

3030
01:16:58,950 --> 01:17:00,160
That mother Fucker,

3031
01:17:00,170 --> 01:17:03,730
you just go down the first kid and I've
seen this kid since he walked in the gym

3032
01:17:03,731 --> 01:17:04,960
at 13.

3033
01:17:04,961 --> 01:17:05,221
Cory,

3034
01:17:05,221 --> 01:17:06,130
Sandy Hagan.

3035
01:17:06,310 --> 01:17:10,340
He came into Aurora high altitude when
I was fighting and he was a basketball

3036
01:17:10,341 --> 01:17:15,341
player in high school and came in
there and he is a mother fucker.

3037
01:17:15,770 --> 01:17:16,603
He is damn good.

3038
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:18,020
He switched fight John Linacre.

3039
01:17:18,021 --> 01:17:19,040
But John got hurt,

3040
01:17:19,310 --> 01:17:19,731
but he,

3041
01:17:19,731 --> 01:17:22,400
until this kid is stand
up by super special,

3042
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:23,480
five 11,

3043
01:17:23,481 --> 01:17:24,291
one 35.

3044
01:17:24,291 --> 01:17:26,390
That's a tall gentleman
for that weight class.

3045
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:28,010
He's a protege of Christian Allen.

3046
01:17:28,011 --> 01:17:28,221
He,

3047
01:17:28,221 --> 01:17:29,120
this kid has skills,

3048
01:17:29,121 --> 01:17:29,360
man.

3049
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:30,200
Damn.

3050
01:17:30,260 --> 01:17:30,771
I don't know.

3051
01:17:30,771 --> 01:17:31,081
I don't,

3052
01:17:31,081 --> 01:17:33,060
I know nothing about Mario Amputees.

3053
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:33,973
I have nothing about,

3054
01:17:33,980 --> 01:17:38,000
see if you can find a video of
Corey Fighting Corey San Hagen,

3055
01:17:38,050 --> 01:17:38,311
uh,

3056
01:17:38,311 --> 01:17:39,500
just his movement.

3057
01:17:39,501 --> 01:17:43,820
You'll see how fluid is movement is in
how an orthodoxy is and he's good in all

3058
01:17:43,821 --> 01:17:44,390
he is.

3059
01:17:44,390 --> 01:17:46,130
The one downfall might be his wrestling,

3060
01:17:46,131 --> 01:17:47,720
but he's fucking good man.

3061
01:17:48,590 --> 01:17:48,981
Yeah.

3062
01:17:48,981 --> 01:17:53,060
It's a fun time right now
for for up and coming talent.

3063
01:17:53,061 --> 01:17:55,460
There's so many cutbacks
as far as combat sports,

3064
01:17:55,461 --> 01:17:57,590
including boxing and MMA.

3065
01:17:57,620 --> 01:17:58,453
They're going to,

3066
01:17:58,650 --> 01:17:59,540
in the business we're in,

3067
01:17:59,541 --> 01:18:00,440
they couldn't be a better time.

3068
01:18:00,441 --> 01:18:00,921
I know,

3069
01:18:00,921 --> 01:18:01,191
right?

3070
01:18:01,191 --> 01:18:02,024
It's crazy.

3071
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:03,231
It's a,

3072
01:18:03,231 --> 01:18:04,520
it's a male soap opera.

3073
01:18:04,521 --> 01:18:06,020
I always have something to talk about.

3074
01:18:06,050 --> 01:18:08,060
The only thing that's
left out is kickboxing.

3075
01:18:08,150 --> 01:18:10,550
Kickboxing still is not
getting any traction.

3076
01:18:10,551 --> 01:18:11,060
You know what?

3077
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:12,020
It's just like Jujitsu,

3078
01:18:12,021 --> 01:18:16,070
like it's never going to just blow up
like these other sports because it's,

3079
01:18:16,130 --> 01:18:17,150
it's the way the world is.

3080
01:18:17,151 --> 01:18:17,930
Joe.

3081
01:18:17,930 --> 01:18:18,763
No one gives a fuck.

3082
01:18:19,550 --> 01:18:20,300
Yeah.

3083
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:24,370
That's the one thing that I think is
missing is kickboxing blowing up the,

3084
01:18:24,410 --> 01:18:24,801
again,

3085
01:18:24,801 --> 01:18:26,210
I love combat sports,

3086
01:18:26,211 --> 01:18:31,211
but it's like I'm not going to jump to
my couch to watch kickbox and origins too

3087
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:33,110
and I love Jujitsu,

3088
01:18:33,111 --> 01:18:37,220
but I'm not going to like if
it was a big kick boxing card,

3089
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,740
like I watched Overeem Bahari didn't we
go to see Joe Schilling fight together?

3090
01:18:42,740 --> 01:18:43,910
Did you come with me to that event?

3091
01:18:43,940 --> 01:18:45,050
I didn't go with you can go with that.

3092
01:18:45,230 --> 01:18:46,130
All tweaking of that.

3093
01:18:46,310 --> 01:18:46,610
Uh,

3094
01:18:46,610 --> 01:18:47,900
coker text me last night.

3095
01:18:47,901 --> 01:18:49,610
I didn't get back to
them so I just got fader.

3096
01:18:49,670 --> 01:18:49,851
Yeah.

3097
01:18:49,851 --> 01:18:50,121
He's like,

3098
01:18:50,121 --> 01:18:50,421
Dude,

3099
01:18:50,421 --> 01:18:51,680
you Lynn for fader Bader.

3100
01:18:51,681 --> 01:18:52,640
Get back to me yet either.

3101
01:18:53,030 --> 01:18:53,863
I was going to ask you.

3102
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:54,320
Yeah,

3103
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:54,711
I was waiting.

3104
01:18:54,711 --> 01:18:55,544
He wants to go.

3105
01:18:55,550 --> 01:18:56,383
Should we go?

3106
01:18:56,510 --> 01:18:57,470
Is it next weekend?

3107
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:58,760
Is the 26th,

3108
01:18:58,761 --> 01:18:59,870
the weekend after your uh,

3109
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:00,733
your event?

3110
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:02,450
It's at the forum.

3111
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:03,951
That can be fun.

3112
01:19:03,951 --> 01:19:05,780
We should go to see fade or fight.

3113
01:19:05,781 --> 01:19:06,411
Lie Too.

3114
01:19:06,411 --> 01:19:06,771
Cause if,

3115
01:19:06,771 --> 01:19:08,540
especially if he loses
plenty of the last time,

3116
01:19:08,780 --> 01:19:13,780
well it's just that the opportunity to
see if there's five all time greatest

3117
01:19:14,961 --> 01:19:15,681
fighters in history.

3118
01:19:15,681 --> 01:19:16,310
He's on that list.

3119
01:19:16,310 --> 01:19:18,290
Have you been to a live feed or never?

3120
01:19:18,530 --> 01:19:19,590
I've been to two when,

3121
01:19:19,610 --> 01:19:23,810
when he fought Ronnie Coleman a Vegas
and when he fell and then I worked at the

3122
01:19:23,811 --> 01:19:26,300
bell tower when he fought a mitre own.

3123
01:19:26,750 --> 01:19:27,670
Here's San Hagen,

3124
01:19:27,790 --> 01:19:28,310
get a change.

3125
01:19:28,310 --> 01:19:28,551
God,

3126
01:19:28,551 --> 01:19:30,260
he's so tall for 35.

3127
01:19:30,650 --> 01:19:35,450
He looks like a Vegan that like cl smooth.

3128
01:19:35,451 --> 01:19:35,690
He is,

3129
01:19:35,690 --> 01:19:36,291
when he switches,

3130
01:19:36,291 --> 01:19:37,490
he got lit up there.

3131
01:19:37,510 --> 01:19:38,343
And this,

3132
01:19:38,450 --> 01:19:39,260
but uh,

3133
01:19:39,260 --> 01:19:39,471
he,

3134
01:19:39,471 --> 01:19:40,520
he's very smooth man.

3135
01:19:40,580 --> 01:19:40,671
Oh,

3136
01:19:40,671 --> 01:19:42,080
he fought Uri Alcantara.

3137
01:19:42,140 --> 01:19:42,973
That's a tough one.

3138
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:43,880
Woo.

3139
01:19:43,940 --> 01:19:44,590
Jesus.

3140
01:19:44,590 --> 01:19:45,020
All this.

3141
01:19:45,020 --> 01:19:46,340
This is one of the rounds of the year.

3142
01:19:46,341 --> 01:19:50,240
He gets in trouble and you think
you submitted his snack in his arm.

3143
01:19:51,380 --> 01:19:52,430
He goes on to win this fight.

3144
01:19:52,431 --> 01:19:55,340
I'm pretty sure Jesus Christ.

3145
01:19:55,850 --> 01:19:56,900
Oh my God.

3146
01:19:56,930 --> 01:19:58,310
How does he not tap here?

3147
01:19:58,311 --> 01:19:59,510
This is crazy.

3148
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:01,310
He's triangled.

3149
01:20:01,970 --> 01:20:04,360
He's in a full on armbar humans.

3150
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:04,630
Guinea.

3151
01:20:04,630 --> 01:20:06,260
His arm fucked up.

3152
01:20:06,620 --> 01:20:07,453
He gets out of this.

3153
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:09,030
Oh my God.

3154
01:20:09,031 --> 01:20:10,410
How's he get out of this?

3155
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:12,720
I have no idea what heart.

3156
01:20:14,370 --> 01:20:14,611
Yeah,

3157
01:20:14,611 --> 01:20:15,530
here's a special talent.

3158
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:16,171
Oh my God.

3159
01:20:16,171 --> 01:20:17,760
He's got some rubber arms.

3160
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:18,990
Look at his arm.

3161
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:20,310
His arm looks broken,

3162
01:20:20,311 --> 01:20:20,671
man.

3163
01:20:20,671 --> 01:20:21,900
He's broken.

3164
01:20:21,930 --> 01:20:22,763
Look at it.

3165
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:24,240
Look how far it's bent back.

3166
01:20:24,241 --> 01:20:25,560
And I'm surprised the reference stuff.

3167
01:20:25,590 --> 01:20:26,423
Oh,

3168
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:28,130
I'm surprised the ref didn't stop though.

3169
01:20:28,350 --> 01:20:28,681
Oh No,

3170
01:20:28,681 --> 01:20:28,861
no.

3171
01:20:28,861 --> 01:20:30,270
It's turned sideways now.

3172
01:20:30,450 --> 01:20:31,650
See the way his wrist is,

3173
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:32,010
Yup.

3174
01:20:32,010 --> 01:20:35,940
That's actually going with the
joint because he's doing this now,

3175
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:39,000
so he's actually in way better shape.

3176
01:20:39,001 --> 01:20:39,810
Nannies bleeding.

3177
01:20:39,810 --> 01:20:40,860
Now he's fucked.

3178
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:41,341
Oh No.

3179
01:20:41,341 --> 01:20:42,360
But he bent it down.

3180
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:42,871
Dude.

3181
01:20:42,871 --> 01:20:43,704
He's safe.

3182
01:20:44,550 --> 01:20:45,383
He's actually,

3183
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:47,910
he's actually doing his
shirt and not doing well.

3184
01:20:47,950 --> 01:20:48,451
Defense.

3185
01:20:48,451 --> 01:20:48,721
Well,

3186
01:20:48,721 --> 01:20:49,111
shoulders,

3187
01:20:49,111 --> 01:20:50,700
not in danger there.

3188
01:20:51,630 --> 01:20:53,280
He's doing very good with defense.

3189
01:20:53,340 --> 01:20:53,431
Look,

3190
01:20:53,431 --> 01:20:55,080
he's getting cut up from this.

3191
01:20:55,230 --> 01:20:56,430
This is incredible.

3192
01:20:56,450 --> 01:20:56,570
Yeah,

3193
01:20:56,570 --> 01:20:58,200
it controls the leg so he can escape.

3194
01:20:59,190 --> 01:21:00,060
Oh my God,

3195
01:21:00,061 --> 01:21:01,800
this is horrific to watch.

3196
01:21:02,850 --> 01:21:04,050
How does he get out of this?

3197
01:21:04,051 --> 01:21:05,070
That's incredible.

3198
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:07,710
How can has got to be like,

3199
01:21:07,711 --> 01:21:11,810
what the fuck is that guy not
to break your will when you,

3200
01:21:11,850 --> 01:21:14,690
when you do all that and he's still
there and they look at him and then he's

3201
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:17,640
smashing you and then you're
tired and you realize like,

3202
01:21:17,670 --> 01:21:18,081
oh my God,

3203
01:21:18,081 --> 01:21:18,311
I should,

3204
01:21:18,311 --> 01:21:19,144
I tried to choke him.

3205
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:21,150
He should've committed to the triangle.

3206
01:21:21,570 --> 01:21:25,170
I mean the triangle is fully locked in
through that permitting to alarm or with

3207
01:21:25,171 --> 01:21:25,740
nasty.

3208
01:21:25,740 --> 01:21:26,610
It was nasty,

3209
01:21:26,611 --> 01:21:28,380
but triangles put you to sleep.

3210
01:21:28,860 --> 01:21:32,130
The thing about armbars is
you can let your arm snap.

3211
01:21:32,490 --> 01:21:34,050
You really can and guys have,

3212
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:37,020
there's some crazy savage is out there
that will let you break their arm.

3213
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:38,370
No time they stop at,

3214
01:21:38,420 --> 01:21:39,780
but when you get put to sleep,

3215
01:21:39,810 --> 01:21:41,040
you get put to sleep,

3216
01:21:41,850 --> 01:21:42,990
get your triangle better,

3217
01:21:42,991 --> 01:21:43,830
be fucking good.

3218
01:21:43,830 --> 01:21:47,400
Especially this [inaudible] triangle
besides fucking by our Tayga,

3219
01:21:47,401 --> 01:21:48,300
like the triangle.

3220
01:21:48,301 --> 01:21:49,710
Better be God damn good man.

3221
01:21:49,711 --> 01:21:52,230
Guys are so good with their
defense with triangles these days.

3222
01:21:52,940 --> 01:21:53,773
Yeah,

3223
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:55,020
and triangles aren't,

3224
01:21:55,810 --> 01:21:56,350
you know,

3225
01:21:56,350 --> 01:21:57,210
Cory's a black belt,

3226
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:57,601
right?

3227
01:21:57,601 --> 01:21:58,021
But it's like,

3228
01:21:58,021 --> 01:21:59,250
who's who's,

3229
01:21:59,251 --> 01:21:59,730
uh,

3230
01:21:59,730 --> 01:22:01,980
who's triangle is that good?

3231
01:22:02,670 --> 01:22:05,070
Like triangle defense
or trial submissions?

3232
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:07,170
Charles Fortune's by the best in the UFC.

3233
01:22:07,330 --> 01:22:07,890
Yeah.

3234
01:22:07,890 --> 01:22:08,131
Yeah.

3235
01:22:08,131 --> 01:22:09,300
T city to city.

3236
01:22:09,301 --> 01:22:10,134
That's what it stands for.

3237
01:22:10,570 --> 01:22:11,580
If people,

3238
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:12,120
you know,

3239
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:15,000
people have seen him in
the Max Holloway fight.

3240
01:22:15,001 --> 01:22:16,560
If you've only seen him
fighting that fight,

3241
01:22:16,561 --> 01:22:16,831
God,

3242
01:22:16,831 --> 01:22:20,130
you go back and watch him do your
homework is submissions are so nasty.

3243
01:22:20,131 --> 01:22:21,540
It's flying triangles.

3244
01:22:22,350 --> 01:22:26,010
San Hagans is hoggin sand hog and
or San Hagen and Sienna Hagen.

3245
01:22:26,130 --> 01:22:28,380
San Hagen is just smashing down on them.

3246
01:22:28,650 --> 01:22:30,780
I'll can taros seemed spent again,

3247
01:22:30,781 --> 01:22:32,640
came to the gym basketball player.

3248
01:22:32,670 --> 01:22:33,960
No experience.

3249
01:22:34,050 --> 01:22:36,900
That's zero at 13 young.

3250
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:42,120
You ever see the 13 year olds learn shit
stink about 13 walk in the gym and you

3251
01:22:42,601 --> 01:22:45,120
have this work ethic from
basketball and you're like,

3252
01:22:45,121 --> 01:22:45,450
oh,

3253
01:22:45,450 --> 01:22:46,470
I'll try this stuff out.

3254
01:22:46,710 --> 01:22:47,541
And you walk in the gym,

3255
01:22:47,541 --> 01:22:51,000
you got Christian Allen who's a Ninja
and then he just downloads all his

3256
01:22:51,030 --> 01:22:52,280
experience into like,

3257
01:22:52,290 --> 01:22:52,830
all right,

3258
01:22:52,830 --> 01:22:54,210
then you're in the fucking UFC.

3259
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:55,561
Amazing.

3260
01:22:55,561 --> 01:22:55,950
That is.

3261
01:22:55,950 --> 01:22:58,830
And he was gonna be an underdog against
John Linacre and he would have beat

3262
01:22:58,890 --> 01:22:59,723
Linacre man.

3263
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:00,360
Dude,

3264
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:02,490
he's some mash in Alcantara.

3265
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:04,710
How does this fight end?

3266
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:05,920
Do you remember?

3267
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:06,580
Uh,

3268
01:23:06,580 --> 01:23:07,413
Corey wins.

3269
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:09,033
He's beaten up

3270
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:12,160
a bonus for that night.

3271
01:23:12,620 --> 01:23:15,160
You will think Alcantara
is probably after all that.

3272
01:23:15,161 --> 01:23:15,371
He's like,

3273
01:23:15,371 --> 01:23:16,091
Jesus Christ.

3274
01:23:16,091 --> 01:23:16,570
Dude,

3275
01:23:16,570 --> 01:23:18,040
he's not even defending himself.

3276
01:23:18,041 --> 01:23:18,874
Well,

3277
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:20,110
he's exhausted from,

3278
01:23:20,111 --> 01:23:24,200
but he's like trying to block the damn
shoulder the way he's defending himself.

3279
01:23:24,201 --> 01:23:24,310
Like,

3280
01:23:24,310 --> 01:23:25,060
look at it the way he's,

3281
01:23:25,060 --> 01:23:25,893
what he's doing.

3282
01:23:26,170 --> 01:23:31,170
It's almost like he's confused that the
guy is still there and he's pounding on

3283
01:23:31,541 --> 01:23:32,374
him now.

3284
01:23:32,510 --> 01:23:34,900
He's like letting him
know he must be exhausted.

3285
01:23:35,350 --> 01:23:36,880
He emptied his gas tank

3286
01:23:39,130 --> 01:23:39,963
up.

3287
01:23:40,010 --> 01:23:40,401
Yeah,

3288
01:23:40,401 --> 01:23:41,480
he's getting fucked up,

3289
01:23:42,260 --> 01:23:42,531
dude.

3290
01:23:42,531 --> 01:23:43,350
Hop Out.

3291
01:23:43,350 --> 01:23:45,410
So like you can move right now.

3292
01:23:45,411 --> 01:23:46,700
He's so exhausted man.

3293
01:23:48,540 --> 01:23:49,010
I'm for that.

3294
01:23:49,010 --> 01:23:51,550
Nogueira sweep the deep half.

3295
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:52,230
Yup.

3296
01:23:52,230 --> 01:23:53,063
Knowing better.

3297
01:23:53,190 --> 01:23:54,023
Um,

3298
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:54,751
yeah man.

3299
01:23:54,751 --> 01:23:55,080
That's it.

3300
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:55,771
That's interesting.

3301
01:23:55,771 --> 01:23:55,920
And,

3302
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:57,090
and that is on,

3303
01:23:57,091 --> 01:23:58,440
what is that on fight pass?

3304
01:23:58,441 --> 01:23:59,680
Some of them are at file pass.

3305
01:23:59,700 --> 01:24:00,091
Oh No.

3306
01:24:00,091 --> 01:24:00,601
Fight Pass.

3307
01:24:00,601 --> 01:24:00,991
That's a,

3308
01:24:00,991 --> 01:24:02,310
this is on ESPN plus.

3309
01:24:02,350 --> 01:24:02,560
Okay.

3310
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:05,970
So goes ESPN plus then he had jumped
a regular ESPN to watch cowboy.

3311
01:24:06,090 --> 01:24:09,120
Then you got to get jumped back to the
digital platform to watch the rest of the

3312
01:24:09,121 --> 01:24:09,610
card.

3313
01:24:09,610 --> 01:24:10,443
Why?

3314
01:24:10,830 --> 01:24:11,521
Terrible idea.

3315
01:24:11,521 --> 01:24:13,320
Whoever did that really terrible idea.

3316
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:15,630
Really terrible ideas back and forth.

3317
01:24:15,660 --> 01:24:16,493
Yeah.

3318
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:18,121
That doesn't make,

3319
01:24:18,121 --> 01:24:19,170
is it not on an APP though?

3320
01:24:20,630 --> 01:24:21,870
ESPN APP saying it goes,

3321
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:24,400
it goes APP regular TV to watch cop.

3322
01:24:24,401 --> 01:24:26,820
Like you can watch ESPN normal on the APP,

3323
01:24:26,850 --> 01:24:27,683
I believe.

3324
01:24:27,810 --> 01:24:28,830
I'm not sure where I'm at.

3325
01:24:28,831 --> 01:24:29,550
That's what I'm asking.

3326
01:24:29,550 --> 01:24:30,390
Well I'm not sure.

3327
01:24:30,430 --> 01:24:33,450
I hope hope Luke Thomas
was talking about it.

3328
01:24:33,780 --> 01:24:36,150
And so can you get the
APP on your television?

3329
01:24:36,151 --> 01:24:37,730
Could you do it through apple TV?

3330
01:24:38,060 --> 01:24:38,470
Should be,

3331
01:24:38,470 --> 01:24:38,900
yeah.

3332
01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:40,260
So you can just watch all of it.

3333
01:24:40,570 --> 01:24:41,400
Yeah.

3334
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:42,690
Have you seen the Oh,

3335
01:24:42,691 --> 01:24:43,830
so at the end he stopped him.

3336
01:24:43,860 --> 01:24:44,520
Yup.

3337
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:45,780
Damn crazy dude.

3338
01:24:45,781 --> 01:24:46,201
Hop Out.

3339
01:24:46,201 --> 01:24:48,060
Fucking Cain Velasquez first.

3340
01:24:48,061 --> 01:24:48,960
Francis in Ghana.

3341
01:24:48,990 --> 01:24:49,381
Ooh,

3342
01:24:49,381 --> 01:24:50,340
that makes me nervous.

3343
01:24:50,550 --> 01:24:51,300
For who?

3344
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:52,133
For Cane.

3345
01:24:52,140 --> 01:24:52,680
Really?

3346
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:53,190
Yeah.

3347
01:24:53,190 --> 01:24:53,731
It's amazing.

3348
01:24:53,731 --> 01:24:54,360
Fight for cane.

3349
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:55,410
It's a great fight for cane.

3350
01:24:55,411 --> 01:24:56,580
If he gets that guy to the ground,

3351
01:24:56,581 --> 01:24:59,010
it's a great fight for Francis
to what makes me excited.

3352
01:24:59,630 --> 01:24:59,940
I mean,

3353
01:24:59,940 --> 01:25:02,880
I say nervous anytime
I see Francis fighting,

3354
01:25:03,030 --> 01:25:05,190
I'm nervous for his opponent because he,

3355
01:25:05,220 --> 01:25:07,170
I wasn't nervous after the steep a fight.

3356
01:25:07,171 --> 01:25:08,370
I was like half fuck.

3357
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:10,050
You weren't nervous in
the Derrick Lewis fight?

3358
01:25:10,290 --> 01:25:11,123
No.

3359
01:25:11,130 --> 01:25:14,660
I thought if he thought the way he
always fights that would be a car Raisie

3360
01:25:14,670 --> 01:25:14,970
fight.

3361
01:25:14,970 --> 01:25:19,970
But he was so nervous from that fight
from the steep bay fight that he just

3362
01:25:20,071 --> 01:25:20,970
dealing terrible.

3363
01:25:21,180 --> 01:25:22,350
He just couldn't pull the trigger.

3364
01:25:22,380 --> 01:25:24,960
Well then it was Derrick
rose had a hurt back.

3365
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:28,290
So you've got a complete shit
show out of two knockout artists.

3366
01:25:28,710 --> 01:25:29,640
I just think that,

3367
01:25:29,641 --> 01:25:30,474
um,

3368
01:25:30,630 --> 01:25:31,081
that,

3369
01:25:31,081 --> 01:25:31,914
uh,

3370
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:32,221
you know,

3371
01:25:32,221 --> 01:25:33,870
Keynes been out for a long time.

3372
01:25:33,930 --> 01:25:35,160
He's a motherfucker though.

3373
01:25:35,180 --> 01:25:35,281
Oh,

3374
01:25:35,281 --> 01:25:36,210
he's the best,

3375
01:25:36,330 --> 01:25:38,160
I think is the best.

3376
01:25:38,220 --> 01:25:40,770
I think he's the best in terms
of like physical ability.

3377
01:25:41,250 --> 01:25:43,020
You think he's the best
heavyweight of all time?

3378
01:25:43,350 --> 01:25:44,220
I think he's amassed.

3379
01:25:44,370 --> 01:25:46,500
I think he has to do I
to do a little more work.

3380
01:25:46,501 --> 01:25:48,780
I think he's the best in terms
of what he's accomplished.

3381
01:25:49,170 --> 01:25:51,720
I think [inaudible] is the
best heavyweight of all
time in terms of what he's

3382
01:25:51,721 --> 01:25:52,231
accomplished.

3383
01:25:52,231 --> 01:25:55,530
Maybe maybe you can make the argument for,

3384
01:25:55,531 --> 01:25:57,840
for BC over doom because
boardroom beat him,

3385
01:25:58,140 --> 01:26:01,020
but I think for doom beat a fade or that
had already been through the ringer and

3386
01:26:01,021 --> 01:26:03,530
pride and you know the
all the chaos there.

3387
01:26:03,531 --> 01:26:04,010
I mean

3388
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:06,920
he had been in those wars
with fucking cro cop,

3389
01:26:06,950 --> 01:26:10,550
but if you're doing beat him when it was
still the ORIF fade or here's the first

3390
01:26:10,551 --> 01:26:11,080
one where,

3391
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:12,040
where you realized she's,

3392
01:26:12,041 --> 01:26:12,650
she knows,

3393
01:26:12,650 --> 01:26:15,230
cause Brett Rogers kind of
took a little bit out of that.

3394
01:26:15,231 --> 01:26:17,500
Did he starched fucking payout him?

3395
01:26:17,510 --> 01:26:19,010
But before that he had trouble with them.

3396
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:19,731
It was a,

3397
01:26:19,731 --> 01:26:20,930
it wasn't an easy fight.

3398
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:24,110
It wasn't an easy fight
and blazing respect Brat.

3399
01:26:24,111 --> 01:26:24,291
Right.

3400
01:26:24,291 --> 01:26:27,230
He did have a cro cop like
I mean you'll curl hop,

3401
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:31,880
fucking punch and leaped and Oh fucking
God don't with that right hand and right

3402
01:26:31,881 --> 01:26:33,410
hand was ridiculous though.

3403
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:34,630
I it's,

3404
01:26:34,631 --> 01:26:34,940
it's,

3405
01:26:34,940 --> 01:26:38,210
it's tough to say grace while time cause
it's the greatest of that time period.

3406
01:26:38,211 --> 01:26:38,560
Cause when,

3407
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:39,680
when he was doing it,

3408
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:41,960
there were specialists that he was great.

3409
01:26:42,050 --> 01:26:43,370
There were certain things
that made him great.

3410
01:26:43,460 --> 01:26:44,570
He was under size.

3411
01:26:44,860 --> 01:26:48,630
Cause if you put his skillset
with his frame now into the,

3412
01:26:48,810 --> 01:26:49,110
the,

3413
01:26:49,110 --> 01:26:49,731
the pool,

3414
01:26:49,731 --> 01:26:49,970
it's,

3415
01:26:49,970 --> 01:26:51,110
I don't know if he's the best,

3416
01:26:51,260 --> 01:26:55,940
but then Cain at his time when there's
jds and he's in his prime Brock Lesnar

3417
01:26:55,941 --> 01:26:57,080
and he's beating those guys,

3418
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:58,880
what cane would do to people,

3419
01:26:58,881 --> 01:27:02,120
he would overwhelm you in a way
that looked like you were drowning.

3420
01:27:02,510 --> 01:27:04,490
His Cardio in and pace was insane.

3421
01:27:04,491 --> 01:27:05,150
Insane.

3422
01:27:05,150 --> 01:27:05,681
Like did you,

3423
01:27:05,681 --> 01:27:08,930
did junior dos Santos fights I
think took so much out of junior,

3424
01:27:09,110 --> 01:27:09,770
both of them.

3425
01:27:09,770 --> 01:27:10,431
I think it took it,

3426
01:27:10,431 --> 01:27:12,030
both of them paid the price it,

3427
01:27:12,100 --> 01:27:12,530
yeah,

3428
01:27:12,530 --> 01:27:13,610
it was the same thing as a,

3429
01:27:13,611 --> 01:27:14,480
I was listening to,

3430
01:27:14,481 --> 01:27:15,314
um,

3431
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:18,530
who's the box you just had on from
a young staff love Kelly Patrick,

3432
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:22,250
how are you saying he doesn't want you
to rematch with Canelo triple g cause it

3433
01:27:22,251 --> 01:27:25,160
takes so much out of those guys
that they're never the same.

3434
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:25,611
I'm using,

3435
01:27:25,611 --> 01:27:28,790
I'm usually on the same thinking path.

3436
01:27:28,791 --> 01:27:29,580
Is that where I'm like,

3437
01:27:29,580 --> 01:27:29,800
God,

3438
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:30,860
if those guys go at it again,

3439
01:27:30,861 --> 01:27:31,150
man,

3440
01:27:31,150 --> 01:27:33,120
we're never going to get a good product.

3441
01:27:33,121 --> 01:27:33,501
But Cain,

3442
01:27:33,501 --> 01:27:35,090
Cain and junior for sure.

3443
01:27:35,180 --> 01:27:39,140
I mean especially the third fight and
the third fight was second one to the

3444
01:27:39,141 --> 01:27:40,610
second one to pop both of them.

3445
01:27:40,611 --> 01:27:42,710
They just jds a steep bay.

3446
01:27:43,010 --> 01:27:43,520
Yeah.

3447
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:43,941
That was,

3448
01:27:43,941 --> 01:27:47,050
that was very steep and jds
has had some Warthen steep.

3449
01:27:47,060 --> 01:27:48,740
It has had some wars and you can,

3450
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:50,250
you can tell that they're there.

3451
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:51,800
They're just different in life.

3452
01:27:52,220 --> 01:27:53,720
I'm not saying it's brain
train on whatever is,

3453
01:27:53,721 --> 01:27:54,320
but it's just,

3454
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:55,131
they're just different.

3455
01:27:55,131 --> 01:27:55,580
They're not,

3456
01:27:55,580 --> 01:27:57,110
they leave a piece of themselves in that,

3457
01:27:57,140 --> 01:27:57,891
in that octagon.

3458
01:27:57,891 --> 01:27:58,101
Well,

3459
01:27:58,101 --> 01:27:59,690
it's for sure some brain trauma.

3460
01:27:59,810 --> 01:28:00,091
Yeah.

3461
01:28:00,091 --> 01:28:02,510
I'm just trying to be nice to try and
be nice and getting hit in the head that

3462
01:28:02,511 --> 01:28:03,990
much like they,

3463
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:04,521
they leave,

3464
01:28:04,521 --> 01:28:08,300
they leave a little piece of a man in
there for our entertainment and I feel a

3465
01:28:08,301 --> 01:28:09,740
little guilty about,

3466
01:28:09,770 --> 01:28:12,200
what's crazy is there's
no talk about Steve Bay.

3467
01:28:12,410 --> 01:28:15,260
Steve paid the most accomplished
heavyweight of all time.

3468
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:18,560
He's the greatest in terms
of like his accomplishments.

3469
01:28:18,740 --> 01:28:21,200
He defended the title more than anybody.

3470
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:24,710
He didn't fight the best guys in their
prime when he fought junior and junior

3471
01:28:24,711 --> 01:28:26,050
was definitely past as promised.

3472
01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:26,721
The knock on him.

3473
01:28:26,721 --> 01:28:26,911
Right.

3474
01:28:26,911 --> 01:28:28,720
It's like the only fight for doom crime.

3475
01:28:28,940 --> 01:28:29,721
That's not his it,

3476
01:28:29,721 --> 01:28:30,440
but again,

3477
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:30,860
when,

3478
01:28:30,860 --> 01:28:32,780
when it was his run during his era,

3479
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:34,090
Steve Bay's the best he said,

3480
01:28:34,091 --> 01:28:35,480
but it was caned during his era.

3481
01:28:35,510 --> 01:28:37,460
He was the best fader was the best.

3482
01:28:37,580 --> 01:28:41,270
It's hard to say this guy has been in
this guy because it's just a different

3483
01:28:41,271 --> 01:28:41,930
time period.

3484
01:28:41,930 --> 01:28:42,410
Right.

3485
01:28:42,410 --> 01:28:45,290
Jordan better than Lebron
Jordan during that era.

3486
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:46,280
By far the best,

3487
01:28:46,460 --> 01:28:47,271
the Brown right now,

3488
01:28:47,271 --> 01:28:48,170
by far the best.

3489
01:28:48,530 --> 01:28:49,250
It's stupid.

3490
01:28:49,250 --> 01:28:50,290
We don't know each other for,

3491
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:50,850
I don't know.

3492
01:28:50,850 --> 01:28:51,410
Anyhow,

3493
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:52,070
so that's,

3494
01:28:52,070 --> 01:28:54,050
that's the question about Steve Pays.

3495
01:28:54,050 --> 01:28:54,980
Like why,

3496
01:28:55,250 --> 01:28:57,740
why is there no talk
about him fighting again?

3497
01:28:58,250 --> 01:29:00,530
Like why have they not
set something he's trying.

3498
01:29:00,590 --> 01:29:01,231
He's like,

3499
01:29:01,231 --> 01:29:02,170
he even tweeted,

3500
01:29:02,270 --> 01:29:03,560
he goes DC before he retired.

3501
01:29:03,570 --> 01:29:04,141
Let's do it,

3502
01:29:04,141 --> 01:29:04,520
man.

3503
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:05,730
Like quit waiting for John.

3504
01:29:05,731 --> 01:29:06,240
Let's do it.

3505
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:06,331
Well,

3506
01:29:06,331 --> 01:29:08,890
he's being really active
on social media trying to,

3507
01:29:09,070 --> 01:29:12,270
but it doesn't seem like there's a lot
cause he has to be because you know why

3508
01:29:12,470 --> 01:29:13,500
it's not in his nature.

3509
01:29:13,590 --> 01:29:14,790
We know that's not steep,

3510
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:17,550
but we know that that's not
Steve Bay's a firefighter.

3511
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:19,050
Humble blue collar dude.

3512
01:29:19,230 --> 01:29:20,310
He's going to put in work.

3513
01:29:20,370 --> 01:29:21,870
Comes to fight all the time.

3514
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:24,870
So Derrick Lewis explains
turning down Steve Bay fight.

3515
01:29:24,900 --> 01:29:27,810
Derrick says they wanted me to
fight steep and short notice.

3516
01:29:27,811 --> 01:29:28,890
I wanted some time off.

3517
01:29:29,220 --> 01:29:30,310
I would still fight Steve Pay,

3518
01:29:30,311 --> 01:29:31,081
but not right now.

3519
01:29:31,081 --> 01:29:31,920
Not so soon.

3520
01:29:32,150 --> 01:29:35,670
Specially after you're fighting a guy
like DC who's more of a wrestler thing

3521
01:29:35,671 --> 01:29:36,960
going to fight steep pay.

3522
01:29:37,230 --> 01:29:38,730
I know I wanted some time off.

3523
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:41,070
So they tried getting steep a fight.

3524
01:29:41,160 --> 01:29:42,910
So they were trying to
get them for the UFC.

3525
01:29:42,911 --> 01:29:44,550
He's a Brooklyn car this weekend.

3526
01:29:44,910 --> 01:29:45,350
Nothing,

3527
01:29:45,350 --> 01:29:45,880
uh,

3528
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:47,010
was that this weekend scene,

3529
01:29:47,070 --> 01:29:48,860
but it's smart of Derek Lewis.

3530
01:29:48,900 --> 01:29:49,440
They,

3531
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:51,480
when you go DC then Steve Bay,

3532
01:29:51,481 --> 01:29:53,130
there couldn't be two
worst matchups for him.

3533
01:29:53,370 --> 01:29:56,340
He's going to get paid to beatings.

3534
01:29:56,370 --> 01:29:57,203
You're going to take,

3535
01:29:57,480 --> 01:29:57,780
you know,

3536
01:29:57,780 --> 01:29:59,310
it's likely unless you connect slack,

3537
01:29:59,340 --> 01:29:59,670
you know,

3538
01:29:59,670 --> 01:30:01,170
Derrick Lewis is doing it for the money.

3539
01:30:01,171 --> 01:30:01,710
He says that,

3540
01:30:01,710 --> 01:30:01,921
you know what,

3541
01:30:01,921 --> 01:30:03,360
I'm trying to make cash man.

3542
01:30:03,361 --> 01:30:04,560
So that'd be the best way to do it.

3543
01:30:04,561 --> 01:30:05,700
But if she's not healthy,

3544
01:30:05,810 --> 01:30:07,320
just give me an ass
whooping from Steve Bay.

3545
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:08,233
Yeah.

3546
01:30:08,670 --> 01:30:09,810
Or he connects,

3547
01:30:10,590 --> 01:30:11,070
cracked.

3548
01:30:11,070 --> 01:30:11,851
That's early on.

3549
01:30:11,851 --> 01:30:15,240
But even Francis connected with steeper
and steeper eight does not give a

3550
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:15,990
bodies.

3551
01:30:15,990 --> 01:30:17,010
That's how freaky is.

3552
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:17,251
Yeah.

3553
01:30:17,251 --> 01:30:18,031
He's tough as shit,

3554
01:30:18,031 --> 01:30:19,800
which is more incredible.

3555
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:21,300
Even that DC took 'em out,

3556
01:30:21,330 --> 01:30:23,090
so them offering steep bay,

3557
01:30:23,330 --> 01:30:24,163
um,

3558
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:25,420
black bees,

3559
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:27,500
you can tell they're not even thinking DC.

3560
01:30:27,540 --> 01:30:29,720
Steepy rebadge I know he's,

3561
01:30:29,721 --> 01:30:31,860
he's getting Jones Lesnar.

3562
01:30:31,890 --> 01:30:32,400
That's,

3563
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:32,910
that's it.

3564
01:30:32,910 --> 01:30:34,200
I don't think lessors fighting.

3565
01:30:34,410 --> 01:30:34,951
I don't either.

3566
01:30:34,951 --> 01:30:36,420
I think some suspects going on there.

3567
01:30:36,450 --> 01:30:41,450
I would be willing to bet dcs last
fight is that heavyweight against John

3568
01:30:41,530 --> 01:30:41,650
Against Jon Jones.

3569
01:30:41,650 --> 01:30:43,290
It's the biggest fight of all time.

3570
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:44,910
That's such a I like,

3571
01:30:44,911 --> 01:30:46,260
and I'm a Brock Lesnar fan.

3572
01:30:46,290 --> 01:30:46,690
I like,

3573
01:30:46,690 --> 01:30:46,891
like,

3574
01:30:46,891 --> 01:30:47,671
I like when he fights,

3575
01:30:47,671 --> 01:30:48,451
he's such a freak.

3576
01:30:48,451 --> 01:30:49,620
I celebrate the guy.

3577
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:53,280
I don't want to let you start hating
Novasky go get a cup of coffee on Brock

3578
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:53,521
fights.

3579
01:30:53,521 --> 01:30:54,354
I don't give a fuck.

3580
01:30:54,570 --> 01:30:55,350
But when,

3581
01:30:55,350 --> 01:30:56,183
uh,

3582
01:30:56,370 --> 01:30:58,770
when you talk about Jon Jones DC that,

3583
01:30:58,771 --> 01:31:01,320
I mean no one's even talking
about proc Jon Jones,

3584
01:31:01,321 --> 01:31:01,681
DC.

3585
01:31:01,681 --> 01:31:03,330
That's the motherfucking fuck.

3586
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:06,300
I think that's bigger
than Conor could be too.

3587
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:07,110
I think it's,

3588
01:31:07,110 --> 01:31:09,240
there's so much history there.

3589
01:31:09,241 --> 01:31:10,320
It's for fucking the habit.

3590
01:31:10,530 --> 01:31:14,160
And I think at DC at
heavyweight fight and John the,

3591
01:31:14,190 --> 01:31:15,360
the gap narrows,

3592
01:31:15,970 --> 01:31:17,250
but at light heavyweight DC,

3593
01:31:17,251 --> 01:31:19,020
it's not for you at heavyweight though.

3594
01:31:19,050 --> 01:31:21,150
And I think that's why
John's kind of like,

3595
01:31:21,330 --> 01:31:24,480
I'll fight them has to be at light
heavyweight because DC does have some

3596
01:31:24,481 --> 01:31:25,500
advantages that heavyweight now,

3597
01:31:25,530 --> 01:31:26,040
but let's,

3598
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:30,930
let's look at what they've done with
Tj Dillashaw dropping him down to

3599
01:31:30,940 --> 01:31:31,773
flyweight.

3600
01:31:31,950 --> 01:31:36,030
Why can't DC do the same thing when
he gets down to the light heavyweight?

3601
01:31:36,210 --> 01:31:36,720
What do you mean?

3602
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:36,901
Oh,

3603
01:31:36,901 --> 01:31:37,950
just saying what do you mean?

3604
01:31:38,340 --> 01:31:38,551
Well,

3605
01:31:38,551 --> 01:31:41,400
he struggled so hard to get down to the
light heavyweight that it fucks with.

3606
01:31:41,401 --> 01:31:42,690
His cardio is conditioning.

3607
01:31:42,691 --> 01:31:43,830
He just doesn't feel the same.

3608
01:31:43,831 --> 01:31:45,210
He says it takes too much out of him.

3609
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:48,990
He feels so much stronger at heavyweight
because he doesn't have to go through

3610
01:31:48,991 --> 01:31:49,650
that weight cut.

3611
01:31:49,650 --> 01:31:50,161
Big Dude,

3612
01:31:50,161 --> 01:31:50,410
man.

3613
01:31:50,410 --> 01:31:51,243
Absolutely.

3614
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:52,553
No,

3615
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:52,861
no.

3616
01:31:52,861 --> 01:31:54,060
He's got body fat on him.

3617
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:55,950
Got Extra body fat.

3618
01:31:55,951 --> 01:31:56,730
That's not,

3619
01:31:56,730 --> 01:31:58,440
it doesn't aid your performance.

3620
01:31:58,560 --> 01:31:59,080
Now wait,

3621
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:03,250
that doesn't diminish himself or is he
a mesomorph where he's different because

3622
01:32:03,370 --> 01:32:06,220
sometimes like a fade or
[inaudible] or or Roy,

3623
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:07,113
Roy Nelson.

3624
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:08,290
If though you sh,

3625
01:32:08,290 --> 01:32:09,520
if you make those guys shred it,

3626
01:32:09,521 --> 01:32:10,390
that's not in their DNA.

3627
01:32:10,420 --> 01:32:11,320
They're not ectomorphs.

3628
01:32:11,321 --> 01:32:11,770
That's not,

3629
01:32:11,770 --> 01:32:12,610
you can't do that,

3630
01:32:12,850 --> 01:32:14,950
but because we see guys
like Francis and Ghana,

3631
01:32:15,070 --> 01:32:16,110
we assume that,

3632
01:32:16,390 --> 01:32:16,991
you know what I'm saying?

3633
01:32:16,991 --> 01:32:20,020
Like ectomorph is the like real skinny,

3634
01:32:20,290 --> 01:32:23,200
super skinny Mesomorph
is what you're thinking.

3635
01:32:23,230 --> 01:32:23,861
That's in the middle.

3636
01:32:23,861 --> 01:32:24,680
That's what I'm saying.

3637
01:32:24,680 --> 01:32:25,150
Don't like.

3638
01:32:25,150 --> 01:32:28,660
I think DC's a mezzo more morph as fat,

3639
01:32:28,690 --> 01:32:28,940
right?

3640
01:32:28,940 --> 01:32:29,620
Yes.

3641
01:32:29,620 --> 01:32:30,770
I think for DC,

3642
01:32:30,850 --> 01:32:31,840
like being shredded,

3643
01:32:31,841 --> 01:32:33,020
his body doesn't function off,

3644
01:32:33,021 --> 01:32:34,240
but it doesn't have to be shredded,

3645
01:32:34,450 --> 01:32:36,640
but he's carrying around
so much extra weight,

3646
01:32:37,570 --> 01:32:39,970
like heavy marching dudes.

3647
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:40,211
Well,

3648
01:32:40,211 --> 01:32:42,490
he starts look at Cain Velasquez.

3649
01:32:42,580 --> 01:32:44,050
He just starts to guys,

3650
01:32:44,140 --> 01:32:48,070
he starts steep a who he just connected
with a beautiful shot in the clinch.

3651
01:32:48,310 --> 01:32:49,660
That's a skill as wrestling.

3652
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:53,260
I think what's going on at heavyweight
with DC as he's not weakened,

3653
01:32:53,710 --> 01:32:56,170
let them eat whatever the fuck
he wants and he's not weakened.

3654
01:32:56,380 --> 01:32:59,680
I think that is critical for him and
I think when he gets done the light

3655
01:32:59,681 --> 01:33:00,071
heavyweight,

3656
01:33:00,071 --> 01:33:00,904
I think he's weakened.

3657
01:33:01,090 --> 01:33:02,470
I think it takes something out of them,

3658
01:33:02,471 --> 01:33:07,471
but I wonder how much they could mitigate
that with great diet and planning it

3659
01:33:08,531 --> 01:33:12,840
out the same way Colivida
has done to to to Tj,

3660
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:18,120
smaller guy naturally and leaner sent
100% but still they leaned him out further

3661
01:33:18,910 --> 01:33:21,760
to get him down to 135
pounds before the weight cut.

3662
01:33:21,790 --> 01:33:26,310
I just don't think it's in
a dcs DNA to be that lean.

3663
01:33:26,311 --> 01:33:27,250
It's just not for him.

3664
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:28,870
Maybe it's just not,

3665
01:33:28,871 --> 01:33:29,704
you know,

3666
01:33:29,710 --> 01:33:30,160
maybe,

3667
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:34,510
but I think everyone benefits
from scientific planning,

3668
01:33:34,511 --> 01:33:35,500
meal planning,

3669
01:33:35,890 --> 01:33:40,330
real analysis of your calories
in calories out nutrients.

3670
01:33:40,570 --> 01:33:40,901
I don't know,

3671
01:33:40,901 --> 01:33:41,734
maybe he does that.

3672
01:33:42,650 --> 01:33:44,710
I bet he does that some degree.

3673
01:33:44,711 --> 01:33:49,711
But some guys I think do better where for
a guy like DC where he just that extra

3674
01:33:49,751 --> 01:33:50,920
fat and it's just,

3675
01:33:50,921 --> 01:33:51,754
that's his thing.

3676
01:33:51,820 --> 01:33:53,320
I hope that they fight.

3677
01:33:53,380 --> 01:33:54,340
If they do fight,

3678
01:33:54,341 --> 01:33:56,140
I hope the first fight
is that heavyweight.

3679
01:33:56,380 --> 01:33:59,440
That's 100% because we've seen the light
heavyweight cause they've talked about

3680
01:33:59,441 --> 01:34:02,200
doing it at light heavyweight and we've
seen the likes of John Watson at light

3681
01:34:02,201 --> 01:34:02,680
heavyweight.

3682
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:03,340
Yeah,

3683
01:34:03,340 --> 01:34:08,340
well John Lott said at light heavyweight
so that it never has to appear that he

3684
01:34:08,531 --> 01:34:12,490
picked up a title when they took it away
from the champion that didn't earn it

3685
01:34:12,491 --> 01:34:13,180
from the champ.

3686
01:34:13,180 --> 01:34:13,811
And I get that.

3687
01:34:13,811 --> 01:34:17,060
But how great would it be if
you're John where you know,

3688
01:34:17,410 --> 01:34:19,330
most people clearly know he's beat DC.

3689
01:34:19,390 --> 01:34:21,700
Then you go to heavyweight
and take that from him.

3690
01:34:21,701 --> 01:34:23,290
It's just the ultimate fuck you.

3691
01:34:24,180 --> 01:34:27,130
But I also think DC's a different
animal and heavyweight and his power is

3692
01:34:27,131 --> 01:34:30,940
different than John does get hit in DC
at heavyweight could land some shit.

3693
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:31,541
Yeah,

3694
01:34:31,541 --> 01:34:32,170
that's the base.

3695
01:34:32,170 --> 01:34:34,270
Not Easy to knock out at all.

3696
01:34:34,330 --> 01:34:35,163
No,

3697
01:34:35,740 --> 01:34:36,700
that would be the fight.

3698
01:34:37,090 --> 01:34:40,030
But it's also like they get
so emotional with each other.

3699
01:34:40,060 --> 01:34:40,893
They hate each.

3700
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:41,651
Yeah.

3701
01:34:41,651 --> 01:34:42,041
DC.

3702
01:34:42,041 --> 01:34:43,180
He fucking hates that guy.

3703
01:34:43,181 --> 01:34:44,610
That's why paper viewed ghost,

3704
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:47,950
like that's what you want that
especially at heavyweight you,

3705
01:34:47,970 --> 01:34:49,420
it's hard to sell a trilogy yet.

3706
01:34:49,421 --> 01:34:50,021
Light heavyweight,

3707
01:34:50,021 --> 01:34:50,854
July,

3708
01:34:50,980 --> 01:34:52,790
July 4th that one's weekend.

3709
01:34:52,791 --> 01:34:54,730
You see DC versus John Jones,

3710
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:56,200
the heavyweight championship of the world.

3711
01:34:56,201 --> 01:34:57,034
Champ champ,

3712
01:34:57,050 --> 01:34:57,411
champ,

3713
01:34:57,411 --> 01:34:57,920
champ,

3714
01:34:57,920 --> 01:34:58,580
boom.

3715
01:34:58,580 --> 01:35:00,620
Oh giant paper view.

3716
01:35:00,621 --> 01:35:02,670
3 million buys prior around the area.

3717
01:35:03,070 --> 01:35:04,220
People are a lot of papers is,

3718
01:35:04,221 --> 01:35:04,491
but yeah,

3719
01:35:04,491 --> 01:35:07,820
there's a lot of it can be done and
that that's what's going to happen.

3720
01:35:07,820 --> 01:35:10,880
Dana's gonna make an
offer they can't refuse.

3721
01:35:11,380 --> 01:35:11,601
Well,

3722
01:35:11,601 --> 01:35:12,980
we're in January,

3723
01:35:13,340 --> 01:35:13,941
February,

3724
01:35:13,941 --> 01:35:15,560
March,

3725
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:15,560
April,

3726
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:15,560
May,

3727
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:15,560
June,

3728
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:15,561
July,

3729
01:35:15,561 --> 01:35:16,394
six months from now.

3730
01:35:16,580 --> 01:35:17,780
You want to retire in March?

3731
01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:18,460
I don't.

3732
01:35:18,460 --> 01:35:18,920
You know what?

3733
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:20,060
It's not going to be June,

3734
01:35:20,060 --> 01:35:20,061
July.

3735
01:35:20,061 --> 01:35:21,890
It's not going to retire in March.

3736
01:35:21,891 --> 01:35:23,000
That's he said his force.

3737
01:35:23,001 --> 01:35:23,211
What?

3738
01:35:23,211 --> 01:35:24,020
Its 40th birthday.

3739
01:35:24,020 --> 01:35:24,853
He's going to retire.

3740
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:26,090
I can't have it here.

3741
01:35:26,330 --> 01:35:27,163
That's why it's steep.

3742
01:35:27,380 --> 01:35:28,101
Tweet him was like,

3743
01:35:28,101 --> 01:35:29,390
dude let's do this before you get out.

3744
01:35:29,630 --> 01:35:30,191
What is this?

3745
01:35:30,191 --> 01:35:32,600
This is from a promo for wrestling,

3746
01:35:32,680 --> 01:35:35,960
the wrestling event this week cause he's
in the royal rumble at the end of the

3747
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:36,320
month.

3748
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:36,681
Is this,

3749
01:35:36,681 --> 01:35:40,670
knew him as just like current him
do think or well it's current him.

3750
01:35:40,671 --> 01:35:42,190
He ain't passing any tests?

3751
01:35:42,610 --> 01:35:43,630
No it's just a couple.

3752
01:35:43,650 --> 01:35:45,050
Pecos Bros.

3753
01:35:45,050 --> 01:35:45,150
Relax.

3754
01:35:45,150 --> 01:35:46,670
Look at the size of them.

3755
01:35:47,350 --> 01:35:48,170
There's another little,

3756
01:35:48,170 --> 01:35:49,220
he's a freak though,

3757
01:35:49,221 --> 01:35:50,054
you know?

3758
01:35:50,210 --> 01:35:55,210
Well he's definitely a freak but is he
physically the st like look up Brock

3759
01:35:57,470 --> 01:35:58,303
Lesnar lean.

3760
01:35:58,910 --> 01:36:00,070
So I trying to find a new picture.

3761
01:36:00,380 --> 01:36:02,000
You ever seen a picture
of him in high school?

3762
01:36:02,060 --> 01:36:02,893
Do you have jacked?

3763
01:36:02,930 --> 01:36:03,680
Huge.

3764
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:06,270
Yeah he had a giant actually giant dude.

3765
01:36:07,430 --> 01:36:10,610
Ultra large size a can
of paint for a head.

3766
01:36:11,420 --> 01:36:13,010
He's so busy tank.

3767
01:36:13,070 --> 01:36:15,920
He looks like every bully of all time
in high school but he's actually a nice

3768
01:36:15,921 --> 01:36:16,754
guy.

3769
01:36:17,450 --> 01:36:19,790
Yeah like there he looks pretty lean.

3770
01:36:21,150 --> 01:36:21,740
That's old.

3771
01:36:21,740 --> 01:36:23,090
Did you ever hear about the story?

3772
01:36:23,210 --> 01:36:24,140
Pat Barry was telling me this.

3773
01:36:24,141 --> 01:36:25,610
He used to train with Brock.

3774
01:36:25,640 --> 01:36:26,301
Good God,

3775
01:36:26,301 --> 01:36:27,134
that's a freak.

3776
01:36:27,170 --> 01:36:28,003
Um,

3777
01:36:28,100 --> 01:36:29,230
when they were,

3778
01:36:29,270 --> 01:36:32,480
they were there in between camp and
Brock had his daughter and his hand and

3779
01:36:32,481 --> 01:36:36,080
people saw him and went to grab and take
pictures and he's holding his daughter

3780
01:36:36,230 --> 01:36:37,070
and they grabbed the hand.

3781
01:36:37,071 --> 01:36:40,250
He's holding his daughter and he just
went off on this dude and he's like the

3782
01:36:40,251 --> 01:36:41,180
nicest guy ever.

3783
01:36:41,350 --> 01:36:42,440
Uproxy always great.

3784
01:36:42,590 --> 01:36:43,460
But I guess this fan was like,

3785
01:36:43,610 --> 01:36:44,151
oh my God,

3786
01:36:44,151 --> 01:36:44,661
Brock Lesnar.

3787
01:36:44,661 --> 01:36:44,961
And he's like,

3788
01:36:44,961 --> 01:36:45,380
Yo,

3789
01:36:45,380 --> 01:36:45,981
I'm with my kids,

3790
01:36:45,981 --> 01:36:46,161
man.

3791
01:36:46,161 --> 01:36:46,641
Don't bother me.

3792
01:36:46,641 --> 01:36:47,870
And some dude was like,

3793
01:36:47,871 --> 01:36:48,081
Nah,

3794
01:36:48,081 --> 01:36:50,320
let's do you get a picture and grabs
him and he's holding his daughter and it

3795
01:36:50,321 --> 01:36:51,154
just went,

3796
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:52,191
he just was like,

3797
01:36:52,191 --> 01:36:53,750
what the fuck are you doing?

3798
01:36:53,751 --> 01:36:56,900
Man grabbed his arm while
he's holding his daughter.

3799
01:36:57,020 --> 01:36:58,200
He sold this down like this and the,

3800
01:36:58,450 --> 01:36:58,760
that's why.

3801
01:36:58,760 --> 01:36:59,050
Yeah,

3802
01:36:59,050 --> 01:36:59,360
that's,

3803
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:01,130
she remind me and grabbed me.

3804
01:37:01,131 --> 01:37:01,311
He's like,

3805
01:37:01,311 --> 01:37:02,210
what the fuck,

3806
01:37:02,211 --> 01:37:02,391
dude?

3807
01:37:02,391 --> 01:37:03,201
I get my daughter,

3808
01:37:03,201 --> 01:37:05,900
you're a man and I'm Brock Lesnar.

3809
01:37:06,130 --> 01:37:07,310
I'm gonna Twist your head off.

3810
01:37:07,610 --> 01:37:09,020
People want what they want.

3811
01:37:09,021 --> 01:37:10,010
And they don't care.

3812
01:37:11,750 --> 01:37:13,280
I just don't see him fighting again.

3813
01:37:13,820 --> 01:37:15,170
I'd be happy if I was wrong.

3814
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:17,870
I think he definitely wants
to get back in there again.

3815
01:37:18,260 --> 01:37:19,460
I mean I think he has some,

3816
01:37:19,550 --> 01:37:22,220
some fights in his mind that
he would like to get back.

3817
01:37:22,250 --> 01:37:23,110
I think it's been,

3818
01:37:23,220 --> 01:37:27,710
I think you could beat Cain 95%
of the division to freak man.

3819
01:37:28,010 --> 01:37:28,840
He is a freak.

3820
01:37:28,840 --> 01:37:30,560
You know Pico grams.

3821
01:37:30,561 --> 01:37:30,971
No Pico.

3822
01:37:30,971 --> 01:37:31,140
Great.

3823
01:37:31,140 --> 01:37:32,240
He's a fucking freak.

3824
01:37:32,241 --> 01:37:33,270
Did he could cramps.

3825
01:37:33,290 --> 01:37:35,600
That's just my reference
for fucking steroids now.

3826
01:37:36,190 --> 01:37:37,220
A Pico Pico.

3827
01:37:37,221 --> 01:37:38,060
So hot right now.

3828
01:37:39,710 --> 01:37:40,760
He's such a freak.

3829
01:37:40,850 --> 01:37:41,683
He is.

3830
01:37:42,240 --> 01:37:44,450
Do you want some skeptical
Hipaa wise for your boy?

3831
01:37:44,451 --> 01:37:49,451
Novitsky how about the test results for
Lesner showed up then went away on their

3832
01:37:49,971 --> 01:37:51,230
website and they're like,

3833
01:37:51,260 --> 01:37:51,381
oh,

3834
01:37:51,381 --> 01:37:52,214
it's just a,

3835
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:53,500
just a random mistake.

3836
01:37:53,501 --> 01:37:54,231
It's just a glitch.

3837
01:37:54,231 --> 01:37:55,980
That 50,000 took care of.

3838
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:56,993
How funny is that?

3839
01:37:57,390 --> 01:37:58,260
I wonder what happened?

3840
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:00,390
What do you think happened?

3841
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:01,460
I don't know.

3842
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:02,280
I literally,

3843
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:03,180
I do not know.

3844
01:38:03,181 --> 01:38:03,331
I,

3845
01:38:03,331 --> 01:38:03,540
I,

3846
01:38:03,540 --> 01:38:06,210
there's some sort of shakiness there.

3847
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:07,140
Oh,

3848
01:38:07,140 --> 01:38:07,801
come on man.

3849
01:38:07,801 --> 01:38:12,510
If you think you saw it as the end all
be all your goddamn on technical issues

3850
01:38:12,540 --> 01:38:15,600
caused online block
Brock Lesnar drug tests,

3851
01:38:15,630 --> 01:38:16,830
number discrepancy.

3852
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:17,821
Here's my prom,

3853
01:38:17,821 --> 01:38:18,031
Joe.

3854
01:38:18,031 --> 01:38:19,170
Here's my problem with this.

3855
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:21,930
So let's just assume Brock,

3856
01:38:21,960 --> 01:38:22,710
I don't know,

3857
01:38:22,710 --> 01:38:24,060
has he had a needle in his ass?

3858
01:38:24,180 --> 01:38:25,013
Maybe.

3859
01:38:25,050 --> 01:38:25,860
Maybe I'm not.

3860
01:38:25,860 --> 01:38:26,400
I don't know.

3861
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:28,740
I've never done it 100% I would guess.

3862
01:38:28,770 --> 01:38:31,350
Well he tested positive
in the Mark Hunt fight.

3863
01:38:31,380 --> 01:38:31,801
Correct.

3864
01:38:31,801 --> 01:38:32,730
And mark suing them for that.

3865
01:38:32,810 --> 01:38:33,550
So,

3866
01:38:33,550 --> 01:38:34,950
so he's marked suing him.

3867
01:38:35,340 --> 01:38:37,050
Mark soon in the UFC still.

3868
01:38:37,110 --> 01:38:40,010
He's still a legal
action with interesting.

3869
01:38:40,020 --> 01:38:40,161
Yeah.

3870
01:38:40,161 --> 01:38:40,381
And he's,

3871
01:38:40,381 --> 01:38:41,220
and he's not in the UFC.

3872
01:38:41,221 --> 01:38:42,750
He's his contract's up with UFC.

3873
01:38:42,751 --> 01:38:44,370
So it's could probably
get even gnarlier now.

3874
01:38:45,060 --> 01:38:46,020
So good luck to Mark Hunt.

3875
01:38:46,140 --> 01:38:46,973
But,

3876
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:48,390
so Brock Lesnar,

3877
01:38:48,570 --> 01:38:50,220
we know steroid user,

3878
01:38:50,490 --> 01:38:51,061
his tasks,

3879
01:38:51,061 --> 01:38:51,271
what?

3880
01:38:51,271 --> 01:38:52,170
It just doesn't show up.

3881
01:38:52,230 --> 01:38:53,011
I mean that's random.

3882
01:38:53,011 --> 01:38:53,211
But what,

3883
01:38:53,211 --> 01:38:56,160
that's coincidence John John's
greatest fighter of all time.

3884
01:38:56,161 --> 01:38:57,030
You saw the issues.

3885
01:38:57,031 --> 01:38:57,720
Pico grams.

3886
01:38:57,720 --> 01:38:59,040
That's just a coincidence.

3887
01:38:59,220 --> 01:39:00,870
It's too much of a coincidence for me.

3888
01:39:00,950 --> 01:39:01,230
Okay.

3889
01:39:01,230 --> 01:39:01,800
But wait a minute,

3890
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:05,460
the Jon Jones you sought of
thing they tested and positive.

3891
01:39:06,060 --> 01:39:06,690
Correct?

3892
01:39:06,690 --> 01:39:06,871
Like,

3893
01:39:06,871 --> 01:39:07,704
what are you saying,

3894
01:39:08,830 --> 01:39:09,220
by the way,

3895
01:39:09,220 --> 01:39:12,630
did test negative after the
fight even for the metabolites.

3896
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:15,340
So heat for the Pico grams afterwards.

3897
01:39:15,341 --> 01:39:16,380
So there's no pico gardens.

3898
01:39:16,410 --> 01:39:17,560
You're saying Pico grants?

3899
01:39:17,561 --> 01:39:19,050
Pico grams is a unit of measurement.

3900
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:19,590
Correct.

3901
01:39:19,590 --> 01:39:21,300
What he tested positive for?

3902
01:39:21,330 --> 01:39:24,150
There were no peacock volite for this,

3903
01:39:24,151 --> 01:39:24,660
this,

3904
01:39:24,660 --> 01:39:25,493
this steroid,

3905
01:39:25,620 --> 01:39:26,190
which,

3906
01:39:26,190 --> 01:39:28,020
and after the fight there was nothing.

3907
01:39:28,021 --> 01:39:28,500
Correct.

3908
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:28,830
Right.

3909
01:39:28,830 --> 01:39:29,460
Okay.

3910
01:39:29,460 --> 01:39:30,450
Cause the numbers,

3911
01:39:30,650 --> 01:39:31,180
they're there.

3912
01:39:31,180 --> 01:39:33,510
What they're saying is that what he,

3913
01:39:33,540 --> 01:39:37,860
what his body has in it is
a response to this sterile.

3914
01:39:37,861 --> 01:39:40,950
It's not detecting like
Anna Var in his system,

3915
01:39:41,190 --> 01:39:44,670
whether detecting is it's a metabolite.

3916
01:39:44,820 --> 01:39:45,211
Correct.

3917
01:39:45,211 --> 01:39:45,871
Or detecting,

3918
01:39:45,871 --> 01:39:50,871
is the body responding to the fact that
this steroid had been in his system

3919
01:39:51,001 --> 01:39:51,720
previously?

3920
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:52,410
Yes.

3921
01:39:52,410 --> 01:39:53,040
But they,

3922
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:54,360
they dashikis coincidence.

3923
01:39:54,361 --> 01:39:54,501
Yeah.

3924
01:39:54,501 --> 01:39:57,060
It's not that it's a co you
keep saying it like it's a joke.

3925
01:39:57,510 --> 01:39:59,680
But the situation to me is a,

3926
01:39:59,900 --> 01:40:00,481
I look at it.

3927
01:40:00,481 --> 01:40:00,711
Okay,

3928
01:40:00,711 --> 01:40:02,070
well why don't you tell
me why it's a joke.

3929
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:03,300
This is why it's a joke.

3930
01:40:03,301 --> 01:40:06,000
Because have you ever heard of any,

3931
01:40:06,001 --> 01:40:11,001
and before I say all this Jones is I
think whether he did anything or not.

3932
01:40:11,490 --> 01:40:12,960
He's still the greatest
fighter on the planet.

3933
01:40:13,020 --> 01:40:13,890
He doesn't need this stuff.

3934
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:14,671
The reason to me,

3935
01:40:14,671 --> 01:40:18,420
cause it's a joke is because the greatest
fighter on the planet to ever enter

3936
01:40:18,421 --> 01:40:21,680
the octagon has all these issues to him.

3937
01:40:21,720 --> 01:40:23,100
He's too much of a coincidence to me.

3938
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:25,950
He has plenty of issues outside of that.

3939
01:40:25,951 --> 01:40:27,090
When you say all of these issues,

3940
01:40:27,091 --> 01:40:28,410
you mean steroid issue?

3941
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:29,190
Correct.

3942
01:40:29,190 --> 01:40:31,330
Right now first one being the Dah,

3943
01:40:31,330 --> 01:40:31,330
Dah,

3944
01:40:31,330 --> 01:40:31,340
Dah.

3945
01:40:31,340 --> 01:40:32,131
I don't mean to cut you off,

3946
01:40:32,131 --> 01:40:35,130
but the first one being the
excuse of the Dick Pills.

3947
01:40:35,340 --> 01:40:35,671
Okay.

3948
01:40:35,671 --> 01:40:36,000
But,

3949
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:39,120
but it was like they
actually got the Dick Pills.

3950
01:40:39,150 --> 01:40:40,140
They tested them.

3951
01:40:40,141 --> 01:40:41,490
This is all documented.

3952
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:42,000
Is it?

3953
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,580
Cause they will those data in finals,

3954
01:40:43,581 --> 01:40:44,161
it pills Joe,

3955
01:40:44,161 --> 01:40:48,060
they felt what they found
were the precursors that
can be found in Dick Pills.

3956
01:40:48,210 --> 01:40:49,980
So if it's Clenbuterol Emma,

3957
01:40:49,981 --> 01:40:51,030
what do you mean when
you're talking about,

3958
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:51,781
so,

3959
01:40:51,781 --> 01:40:52,610
so the,

3960
01:40:52,610 --> 01:40:54,200
the thing that he flagged for

3961
01:40:54,250 --> 01:40:55,780
those do show up in Dick Pills.

3962
01:40:55,890 --> 01:40:56,140
Yeah.

3963
01:40:56,140 --> 01:40:57,880
They also show up in
a lot of other things.

3964
01:40:58,330 --> 01:40:58,751
Right.

3965
01:40:58,751 --> 01:41:03,610
But he got them the Dick Pills that
he took and they had it in them.

3966
01:41:04,570 --> 01:41:05,111
Correct.

3967
01:41:05,111 --> 01:41:05,950
So that means he,

3968
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:07,350
so then he would cook.

3969
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:11,350
But in the amount that
he had in his system,

3970
01:41:12,130 --> 01:41:16,990
what they're saying is the only way
that could exist is through a tainted

3971
01:41:16,991 --> 01:41:17,530
supplement.

3972
01:41:17,530 --> 01:41:19,000
The way they tested them before,

3973
01:41:19,180 --> 01:41:21,190
the way they tested them after the wet,

3974
01:41:21,191 --> 01:41:23,980
the small window of time where
he was positive for that thing,

3975
01:41:23,981 --> 01:41:27,790
there'd be no performance
enhancing benefit for him
to take something in a micro

3976
01:41:27,791 --> 01:41:28,690
dose or whatever.

3977
01:41:29,080 --> 01:41:32,980
And that it's in such a small amount
that it had to be a tainted supplement.

3978
01:41:33,160 --> 01:41:36,220
They got them the actual
supplement that he took,

3979
01:41:36,221 --> 01:41:37,480
the Dick pill supplement,

3980
01:41:37,900 --> 01:41:40,930
it had it in it that contained that
sick and he got punished for that.

3981
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:45,070
This is not like a steroid that he took
were made him a better fighter or made

3982
01:41:45,071 --> 01:41:46,000
him a better athlete.

3983
01:41:46,001 --> 01:41:49,870
So to play devil's advocate here so
that that stuff that comes in those dick

3984
01:41:49,871 --> 01:41:52,060
pills and you can get from other steroids,

3985
01:41:52,061 --> 01:41:53,420
but it happens to be in those days,

3986
01:41:53,620 --> 01:41:54,450
you certainly can.

3987
01:41:54,450 --> 01:41:54,940
Correct.

3988
01:41:54,940 --> 01:41:55,470
But,

3989
01:41:55,470 --> 01:41:59,380
but that's one narrative that you took
clear that you could say what's in these

3990
01:41:59,380 --> 01:41:59,590
Dick Pills?

3991
01:41:59,590 --> 01:42:00,120
I'm not saying,

3992
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:01,210
I'm saying I just can't do that.

3993
01:42:01,211 --> 01:42:01,690
That's true.

3994
01:42:01,690 --> 01:42:06,690
But it's in such a small amount in his
body and it wasn't in his body before and

3995
01:42:06,851 --> 01:42:10,690
it wasn't in his body after which showed
that it was only in his body and an

3996
01:42:10,691 --> 01:42:13,000
extremely small amounts
for a small window,

3997
01:42:13,930 --> 01:42:15,610
but a small window of time.

3998
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:16,810
So it's not like he had,

3999
01:42:16,830 --> 01:42:18,550
it's not even like this stuff,

4000
01:42:18,551 --> 01:42:22,540
which is a metabolite which is
showing a response to the body,

4001
01:42:23,140 --> 01:42:24,580
the body responding to the steroids.

4002
01:42:24,580 --> 01:42:25,480
And let me ask this Joe.

4003
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:26,553
Okay.

4004
01:42:26,740 --> 01:42:31,150
Why does no other fighter have any Pico
Pico grants that this pulsating effect

4005
01:42:31,151 --> 01:42:31,984
really?

4006
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:32,681
Well,

4007
01:42:32,681 --> 01:42:33,520
that's not true.

4008
01:42:33,610 --> 01:42:35,660
I mean other fighters had tested,

4009
01:42:35,860 --> 01:42:38,470
Frank Mir tested positive
for something two years.

4010
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:40,200
Tom Lawler test it,

4011
01:42:40,210 --> 01:42:45,210
but Frank Mir didn't go through
the same steps that Jon Jones did.

4012
01:42:45,311 --> 01:42:48,430
He didn't provide them with a,

4013
01:42:48,450 --> 01:42:51,310
I forget what the exact there was.

4014
01:42:51,370 --> 01:42:56,370
There was something that John did also
that lowered his sentencing and it was

4015
01:42:56,501 --> 01:42:56,781
covered.

4016
01:42:56,781 --> 01:42:57,710
He was an informant.

4017
01:42:57,940 --> 01:42:58,420
Yes.

4018
01:42:58,420 --> 01:43:01,450
It was cooperating with Usada.

4019
01:43:01,730 --> 01:43:02,170
Yeah.

4020
01:43:02,170 --> 01:43:02,530
Or,

4021
01:43:02,530 --> 01:43:05,440
or agreeing to cooperate with Usada.

4022
01:43:06,790 --> 01:43:07,360
Yeah.

4023
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:10,450
That was were just cool with that.

4024
01:43:11,050 --> 01:43:11,441
Listen,

4025
01:43:11,441 --> 01:43:12,730
I don't even know what that means.

4026
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:13,481
I don't either.

4027
01:43:13,481 --> 01:43:14,860
But let me ask you this.

4028
01:43:15,130 --> 01:43:19,480
If I agreed to Usada to be an informant,

4029
01:43:20,210 --> 01:43:21,700
snitches get stitches.

4030
01:43:21,790 --> 01:43:22,500
Correct.

4031
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:23,380
But unless you're John,

4032
01:43:23,381 --> 01:43:24,250
then no one can beat you up,

4033
01:43:24,251 --> 01:43:24,970
so you're fine.

4034
01:43:24,970 --> 01:43:25,810
But the thing is,

4035
01:43:25,811 --> 01:43:26,644
is

4036
01:43:27,790 --> 01:43:30,280
the only way I can inform
you is if something that,

4037
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:30,450
uh,

4038
01:43:30,450 --> 01:43:30,910
of that,

4039
01:43:30,910 --> 01:43:31,270
um,

4040
01:43:31,270 --> 01:43:32,650
knowing that I know of,

4041
01:43:32,710 --> 01:43:34,150
I can inform you of Joseph.

4042
01:43:34,490 --> 01:43:35,560
That speculation.

4043
01:43:35,590 --> 01:43:37,540
That was what I asked Novitsky I was like,

4044
01:43:37,541 --> 01:43:39,040
if he didn't do anything wrong,

4045
01:43:39,550 --> 01:43:40,000
like,

4046
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,040
and what is he going to offer?

4047
01:43:42,520 --> 01:43:42,941
Because if,

4048
01:43:42,941 --> 01:43:44,530
unless he took something,

4049
01:43:45,010 --> 01:43:46,180
unless you know what you're doing.

4050
01:43:46,270 --> 01:43:50,650
Like if I'm an informant for the
FBI or for the feds for cocaine,

4051
01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:50,990
right.

4052
01:43:50,990 --> 01:43:52,190
I know my cocaine.

4053
01:43:52,360 --> 01:43:52,490
Right.

4054
01:43:52,490 --> 01:43:53,510
They're not going to get Joe blow.

4055
01:43:53,511 --> 01:43:56,600
That makes my fucking express so we can
get the guy who knows the ins and outs

4056
01:43:56,601 --> 01:43:57,250
of cocaine.

4057
01:43:57,250 --> 01:43:58,083
Right.

4058
01:43:58,490 --> 01:44:00,080
That's again,

4059
01:44:00,140 --> 01:44:00,681
that's I'm like,

4060
01:44:00,681 --> 01:44:01,400
all right,

4061
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:01,750
cool.

4062
01:44:01,750 --> 01:44:02,240
More.

4063
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:06,830
They have a conversation with him
and he says he can provide them with

4064
01:44:06,831 --> 01:44:10,070
information with how guys are getting
away with passing truck to and how would

4065
01:44:10,071 --> 01:44:11,630
you know about that
unless you're in on that?

4066
01:44:11,630 --> 01:44:12,140
No,

4067
01:44:12,140 --> 01:44:12,741
I don't either.

4068
01:44:12,741 --> 01:44:13,840
I'm just saying again,

4069
01:44:13,940 --> 01:44:17,870
to me all of his is a little too much of
coincidence that the best fight on the

4070
01:44:17,871 --> 01:44:19,280
planet earth has these issues.

4071
01:44:19,281 --> 01:44:23,180
The best fight in the planner is also
ran away from a hit and run smash into a

4072
01:44:23,181 --> 01:44:24,440
girl and broke her arm.

4073
01:44:24,500 --> 01:44:27,650
He also drove his car into a tree.

4074
01:44:27,830 --> 01:44:32,030
He's a reckless person who takes
a lot of chances and he does some,

4075
01:44:32,510 --> 01:44:35,750
at least in the past has done some
things that are not very wise.

4076
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:40,190
This could social under that or
it could fall is correct or two.

4077
01:44:40,191 --> 01:44:41,390
I began to play devil's advocate.

4078
01:44:41,420 --> 01:44:42,650
I'm not accusing them of anything.

4079
01:44:42,990 --> 01:44:46,670
Play Devil's advocate or a guy who was
that Lucy Goosey outside the AUC gun

4080
01:44:47,290 --> 01:44:51,500
might have taken some performance
enhancing things cause that would be the

4081
01:44:51,501 --> 01:44:55,520
similar traits could have
except in this situation.

4082
01:44:55,521 --> 01:44:59,710
It doesn't line up with the facts
of what he took in terms of longterm

4083
01:44:59,720 --> 01:45:00,371
metabolites,

4084
01:45:00,371 --> 01:45:02,870
short term metabolites and
medium term metabolize.

4085
01:45:03,110 --> 01:45:03,830
The only,

4086
01:45:03,830 --> 01:45:05,060
the only lonely,

4087
01:45:05,061 --> 01:45:07,370
only longterm metabolites existed,

4088
01:45:07,550 --> 01:45:09,050
which means that whatever he took,

4089
01:45:09,051 --> 01:45:10,610
he had to have taken a long time ago.

4090
01:45:10,670 --> 01:45:15,640
Now the problem with this is this
all comes from that Guy Gregory re,

4091
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:16,760
re Cenk office,

4092
01:45:16,761 --> 01:45:17,450
and I say his name.

4093
01:45:17,450 --> 01:45:18,680
You're talking about the one test.

4094
01:45:19,030 --> 01:45:19,490
The,

4095
01:45:19,490 --> 01:45:23,510
what I'm talking about is a study that
shows these metabolites is all from this

4096
01:45:23,511 --> 01:45:24,650
one individual.

4097
01:45:24,651 --> 01:45:26,810
This guy Grigory were Cenk Goff,

4098
01:45:26,811 --> 01:45:28,790
who was the man from that documentary.

4099
01:45:28,820 --> 01:45:29,361
ICARUS.

4100
01:45:29,361 --> 01:45:32,090
He used to work for the Russian doping,

4101
01:45:32,120 --> 01:45:33,980
the state sponsored doping program.

4102
01:45:34,370 --> 01:45:37,160
He's the one who established these tests.

4103
01:45:37,161 --> 01:45:39,500
And the way he established
his test is very,

4104
01:45:39,950 --> 01:45:40,640
uh,

4105
01:45:40,640 --> 01:45:42,700
highly criticized by people because,

4106
01:45:43,490 --> 01:45:43,731
well,

4107
01:45:43,731 --> 01:45:45,140
it's not suspect it's,

4108
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:48,830
but it's criticized by people
because he injected himself and,

4109
01:45:49,010 --> 01:45:51,770
and test that all these
metabolites on himself.

4110
01:45:52,040 --> 01:45:56,720
And this is not been done on any peer
reviewed test outside of his research.

4111
01:45:57,110 --> 01:45:57,441
Um,

4112
01:45:57,441 --> 01:45:58,610
it hasn't been duplicated.

4113
01:45:58,611 --> 01:46:02,450
The problem is it's not legal to perform
these sorts of tests on people in

4114
01:46:02,451 --> 01:46:03,284
America.

4115
01:46:03,380 --> 01:46:06,620
You can't just shoot people up with
illegal steroids in America and find out

4116
01:46:06,830 --> 01:46:09,800
what it does to them and they'll do that.

4117
01:46:10,100 --> 01:46:13,520
I told him to get Sean Shelby whack
'em up with a bunch of steroids.

4118
01:46:13,590 --> 01:46:15,860
Just test for Sean's down for,

4119
01:46:15,870 --> 01:46:16,703
he wants to get bigger,

4120
01:46:17,090 --> 01:46:20,040
just do it or just do it to veto
bell wherever he's fighting,

4121
01:46:20,050 --> 01:46:20,883
just set him down,

4122
01:46:21,170 --> 01:46:21,531
tell him,

4123
01:46:21,531 --> 01:46:22,010
look veto,

4124
01:46:22,010 --> 01:46:23,820
we've got an extra couple of
hundred grand for you on the side.

4125
01:46:23,821 --> 01:46:26,930
It's just do this and let us do
some plugging up with Dick Pills.

4126
01:46:26,931 --> 01:46:27,501
See how it goes,

4127
01:46:27,501 --> 01:46:27,711
Bro.

4128
01:46:27,711 --> 01:46:30,620
Fucking cocaine tainted creating for real.

4129
01:46:30,980 --> 01:46:31,813
He would do it.

4130
01:46:33,770 --> 01:46:34,011
Yeah.

4131
01:46:34,011 --> 01:46:34,431
I don't know,

4132
01:46:34,431 --> 01:46:34,721
man.

4133
01:46:34,721 --> 01:46:34,791
I'm,

4134
01:46:34,791 --> 01:46:35,040
I'm,

4135
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:35,460
I,

4136
01:46:35,460 --> 01:46:37,940
I maintain an open mind.

4137
01:46:38,420 --> 01:46:39,200
I do too.

4138
01:46:39,200 --> 01:46:40,520
I'm not accusing John Anything,

4139
01:46:40,521 --> 01:46:41,420
but again,

4140
01:46:41,421 --> 01:46:41,991
for me,

4141
01:46:41,991 --> 01:46:42,950
and this is just me,

4142
01:46:43,070 --> 01:46:44,360
it's too much of a coincidence,

4143
01:46:44,450 --> 01:46:47,350
coincidence for it to raise
some red flags from me.

4144
01:46:47,351 --> 01:46:48,260
Glide tried to,

4145
01:46:48,261 --> 01:46:52,440
to independent scientists outside
of Novitsky where I was sending guys

4146
01:46:52,441 --> 01:46:52,981
information.

4147
01:46:52,981 --> 01:46:55,350
They were sending me back or saying
them all the work that they did.

4148
01:46:55,590 --> 01:46:58,270
I send them all the
relevant studies and uh,

4149
01:46:58,290 --> 01:47:03,290
one of them who was suspicious initially
after reviewing all this stuff decided

4150
01:47:03,571 --> 01:47:07,430
that it doesn't seem like it's likely
that it could be possible that he could

4151
01:47:07,431 --> 01:47:08,430
have actually cheated.

4152
01:47:08,700 --> 01:47:13,680
He said it's more like she did during
that time more likely that the actual,

4153
01:47:13,740 --> 01:47:16,210
the tainted supplement excuse is,

4154
01:47:16,350 --> 01:47:17,183
and by the way,

4155
01:47:17,190 --> 01:47:18,900
the team tainted supplement,

4156
01:47:18,901 --> 01:47:21,510
I'm using the air quotes
supplement was never provided.

4157
01:47:21,510 --> 01:47:23,220
That supplement was never provided.

4158
01:47:23,610 --> 01:47:26,640
So unless they did it
to Usada and he cited,

4159
01:47:26,641 --> 01:47:27,960
didn't want to release it,

4160
01:47:28,290 --> 01:47:31,620
the number one question was,

4161
01:47:31,621 --> 01:47:34,290
was it cocaine that was
tainted with creatine?

4162
01:47:34,620 --> 01:47:35,191
That was the,

4163
01:47:35,191 --> 01:47:39,060
that was where people thought it came
from because it's really co according to

4164
01:47:39,061 --> 01:47:40,860
Novitsky when he was
working for the government,

4165
01:47:41,130 --> 01:47:46,130
that would be a really common thing that
creatine was used in cocaine to cut it

4166
01:47:47,131 --> 01:47:48,390
because it looks like coke.

4167
01:47:48,690 --> 01:47:49,650
It cuts with coke.

4168
01:47:49,651 --> 01:47:50,131
It's normal.

4169
01:47:50,131 --> 01:47:51,030
It's not toxic.

4170
01:47:51,180 --> 01:47:55,620
So they would always mix in cheap
creotine with cocaine to make more coke.

4171
01:47:55,680 --> 01:47:56,280
Makes Sense.

4172
01:47:56,280 --> 01:47:56,491
Yeah,

4173
01:47:56,491 --> 01:47:57,031
it makes sense.

4174
01:47:57,031 --> 01:47:57,360
And he,

4175
01:47:57,360 --> 01:47:58,140
that's what,

4176
01:47:58,140 --> 01:47:59,370
that's what Novitsky believed,

4177
01:47:59,670 --> 01:48:00,780
but that's not what he believed.

4178
01:48:01,170 --> 01:48:02,940
But he believed that was a possibility.

4179
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:04,770
I've heard all sorts of possibilities.

4180
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:05,190
Yeah.

4181
01:48:05,190 --> 01:48:06,870
It'd be interesting to
know the actual truth.

4182
01:48:08,730 --> 01:48:09,563
Yeah.

4183
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:10,560
Well you know,

4184
01:48:11,220 --> 01:48:12,570
we do not going to know that.

4185
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:17,040
I think we know as much as we're going
to know unless John comes out was John

4186
01:48:17,041 --> 01:48:18,210
retires and it's like,

4187
01:48:18,250 --> 01:48:18,740
you know,

4188
01:48:18,740 --> 01:48:19,280
I had,

4189
01:48:19,280 --> 01:48:22,950
I had a doctor and he would stick it
in my fingernails and see him slowly

4190
01:48:22,951 --> 01:48:23,640
release.

4191
01:48:23,640 --> 01:48:23,810
Yeah.

4192
01:48:23,810 --> 01:48:26,760
With some high advance microdose.

4193
01:48:26,790 --> 01:48:28,020
He would never admit that though.

4194
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:30,480
Nobody ever admits it
unless they get caught.

4195
01:48:30,570 --> 01:48:34,140
It tarnish your legacy unless
it's like an MLB thing.

4196
01:48:34,380 --> 01:48:36,450
But so many people were
quick to jump on the,

4197
01:48:36,600 --> 01:48:38,710
he's a cheater bandwagon.

4198
01:48:38,790 --> 01:48:39,091
I'm like,

4199
01:48:39,091 --> 01:48:39,924
man,

4200
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:41,700
it got you gotta be careful.

4201
01:48:41,701 --> 01:48:42,770
I gotta be careful with that.

4202
01:48:42,790 --> 01:48:42,861
Yeah,

4203
01:48:42,861 --> 01:48:43,694
be careful of that.

4204
01:48:43,830 --> 01:48:46,140
But also you've got to
be careful with that.

4205
01:48:46,141 --> 01:48:49,080
But also you should be suspicious.

4206
01:48:49,140 --> 01:48:50,070
You should be suspicious.

4207
01:48:50,071 --> 01:48:54,000
I don't think that if when
you saw the Novitsky go,

4208
01:48:54,120 --> 01:48:55,110
it's all good man.

4209
01:48:55,140 --> 01:48:55,811
It was a date pill.

4210
01:48:55,811 --> 01:48:56,370
You Go,

4211
01:48:56,370 --> 01:48:57,203
cool man,

4212
01:48:58,470 --> 01:48:58,831
I don't,

4213
01:48:58,831 --> 01:48:59,730
I don't think you can do that.

4214
01:48:59,790 --> 01:49:01,350
Well they definitely didn't do that.

4215
01:49:01,351 --> 01:49:01,521
He,

4216
01:49:01,521 --> 01:49:02,040
he,

4217
01:49:02,040 --> 01:49:03,570
he lost a lot of money.

4218
01:49:03,820 --> 01:49:04,680
But the fans do.

4219
01:49:04,860 --> 01:49:05,693
That's what the fans do.

4220
01:49:05,940 --> 01:49:06,180
You know,

4221
01:49:06,180 --> 01:49:07,170
some people can do that.

4222
01:49:07,260 --> 01:49:08,430
I think it's okay to go.

4223
01:49:08,550 --> 01:49:08,941
God I,

4224
01:49:08,941 --> 01:49:09,301
it's just,

4225
01:49:09,301 --> 01:49:10,051
I don't know man.

4226
01:49:10,051 --> 01:49:11,430
Like it's too much smoke here for me.

4227
01:49:11,431 --> 01:49:12,310
It's okay to do that.

4228
01:49:12,311 --> 01:49:15,690
What it's not okay do is
to say he was cheating.

4229
01:49:15,691 --> 01:49:16,130
He's,

4230
01:49:16,130 --> 01:49:16,850
you know,

4231
01:49:16,850 --> 01:49:17,850
he's busted.

4232
01:49:17,851 --> 01:49:18,900
So the only reason these wires,

4233
01:49:18,901 --> 01:49:20,400
you have this stuff in his system,

4234
01:49:20,920 --> 01:49:21,500
that one,

4235
01:49:21,500 --> 01:49:21,620
no,

4236
01:49:21,620 --> 01:49:22,291
it's fine to say,

4237
01:49:22,291 --> 01:49:23,790
why's he have this stuff in the system?

4238
01:49:24,060 --> 01:49:24,301
Well,

4239
01:49:24,301 --> 01:49:25,190
this is what I said,

4240
01:49:25,380 --> 01:49:26,950
but they showed why he had an assistant.

4241
01:49:27,080 --> 01:49:27,180
Yeah,

4242
01:49:27,180 --> 01:49:28,890
but doesn't mean you should
have it in your system now.

4243
01:49:28,891 --> 01:49:29,281
He definitely,

4244
01:49:29,281 --> 01:49:30,780
she's not cool to have it in the system.

4245
01:49:30,781 --> 01:49:31,200
No,

4246
01:49:31,200 --> 01:49:31,381
no.

4247
01:49:31,381 --> 01:49:32,011
So it's okay to go.

4248
01:49:32,011 --> 01:49:35,490
Why the fuck is in the best fighter in
the world system and then what are you

4249
01:49:35,491 --> 01:49:35,791
doing,

4250
01:49:35,791 --> 01:49:36,480
dude?

4251
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:37,210
That's fine.

4252
01:49:37,210 --> 01:49:40,980
There's some shit that's going on right
now that they haven't figured out yet.

4253
01:49:41,010 --> 01:49:41,970
That's going to be revealed.

4254
01:49:41,980 --> 01:49:43,620
We leave you shit cited.

4255
01:49:44,390 --> 01:49:45,223
I think so.

4256
01:49:45,260 --> 01:49:46,220
The the,

4257
01:49:46,221 --> 01:49:47,054
the drugs,

4258
01:49:47,380 --> 01:49:49,540
those then that underworld
is always ahead of the,

4259
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:50,530
of the testing.

4260
01:49:50,530 --> 01:49:50,980
Always.

4261
01:49:50,980 --> 01:49:51,341
Always.

4262
01:49:51,341 --> 01:49:51,760
Always.

4263
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:54,400
That's what Novitsky said at first,

4264
01:49:54,401 --> 01:49:59,140
but now he thinks it's reached this
point where the testing is so good.

4265
01:49:59,410 --> 01:50:02,740
Do you know the testing threshold that
he tested positive for for the peak of

4266
01:50:02,741 --> 01:50:07,741
grams is five two to 5,000 times
stronger than the Wata threshold?

4267
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:11,530
Yeah.

4268
01:50:11,530 --> 01:50:16,530
So He'd have 2000 to 5,000 times more
of it in his system or 2000 to five

4269
01:50:18,970 --> 01:50:20,210
thousand two thousand percent
numbers are tough to keep up with.

4270
01:50:20,380 --> 01:50:21,070
I don't remember.

4271
01:50:21,070 --> 01:50:26,070
Andy Foster told me what it was either
way but an insane amount of much higher

4272
01:50:27,250 --> 01:50:27,800
quantities.

4273
01:50:27,800 --> 01:50:31,150
This shit for him to test
positive and water like these,

4274
01:50:31,151 --> 01:50:34,960
these tests that they use now are insane.

4275
01:50:35,230 --> 01:50:37,810
Some of the doctors in the undergrads now,

4276
01:50:37,811 --> 01:50:39,190
this is the thing
they're doing well maybe,

4277
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:40,900
but this is the thing they're doing now.

4278
01:50:40,930 --> 01:50:41,081
Well,

4279
01:50:41,081 --> 01:50:42,880
the thing is like if it's so low,

4280
01:50:42,881 --> 01:50:44,730
you're not going to have a
performance enhancing benefits.

4281
01:50:44,731 --> 01:50:48,520
It has to actually be in your system in
order to have a performance enhancing

4282
01:50:48,521 --> 01:50:49,180
benefit.

4283
01:50:49,180 --> 01:50:54,180
But now in 2019 they are
actually considering lowering
their standards so that

4284
01:50:55,481 --> 01:51:00,310
say if you do take some creatine and it
does have the tiniest trace amount of

4285
01:51:00,330 --> 01:51:01,900
Austrian or something like that,

4286
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:04,270
that's not going to show
up positive and him,

4287
01:51:04,271 --> 01:51:07,880
which is how maybe they should do it
because it's so strict now where it's,

4288
01:51:08,110 --> 01:51:09,620
it's tainting guys legacy.

4289
01:51:09,621 --> 01:51:10,770
You look at Josh Barnett,

4290
01:51:10,771 --> 01:51:11,680
you look at Frank Mir,

4291
01:51:12,070 --> 01:51:12,430
this barn,

4292
01:51:12,430 --> 01:51:14,800
that's another one where
they eventually cleared him,

4293
01:51:15,130 --> 01:51:17,890
but Jesus Christ took
a year fucked up man.

4294
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:19,450
And then on top of that,

4295
01:51:19,451 --> 01:51:23,190
everybody knew that he was under
suspicion and Josh has tested positive for

4296
01:51:23,191 --> 01:51:23,770
four.

4297
01:51:23,770 --> 01:51:25,960
So everybody assumed that he
was doing something fucked them.

4298
01:51:26,110 --> 01:51:27,580
Novitsky told me that the stuff,

4299
01:51:27,581 --> 01:51:32,050
the testing is so good now that if you
and I were in this room and I had a jar

4300
01:51:32,051 --> 01:51:36,550
of creating that had steroids in it and
I popped it open and the fucking dust

4301
01:51:36,551 --> 01:51:38,920
got in the air and we ingested that dust,

4302
01:51:39,490 --> 01:51:42,760
we would both test positive
from opening a jar in a room.

4303
01:51:42,850 --> 01:51:44,500
And that's crazy good for them.

4304
01:51:44,501 --> 01:51:48,220
But I think there's the Elan Musk
of steroid pds out there who's like,

4305
01:51:48,221 --> 01:51:48,401
yeah,

4306
01:51:48,401 --> 01:51:48,851
cool man.

4307
01:51:48,851 --> 01:51:49,810
You guys are testing for this.

4308
01:51:49,930 --> 01:51:50,621
We're over here.

4309
01:51:50,621 --> 01:51:51,270
You dumb ass.

4310
01:51:51,270 --> 01:51:51,610
His bed.

4311
01:51:51,610 --> 01:51:54,520
He's got a lot of y's and z's
and his name and had cheese.

4312
01:51:55,320 --> 01:51:55,660
Yeah.

4313
01:51:55,660 --> 01:51:56,290
It's just push.

4314
01:51:56,290 --> 01:51:57,110
Just fuck.

4315
01:51:57,110 --> 01:51:58,420
It was like a glass house.

4316
01:51:58,480 --> 01:51:58,960
Hell yeah.

4317
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:00,300
Probably dead as we're speaking.

4318
01:52:00,310 --> 01:52:02,260
They probably shot him and sleep now.

4319
01:52:02,610 --> 01:52:02,900
Yeah,

4320
01:52:02,900 --> 01:52:06,050
I mean they still applies to
all or did you see a Chris,

4321
01:52:06,070 --> 01:52:07,530
did you see that insane man?

4322
01:52:08,420 --> 01:52:09,253
A second.

4323
01:52:09,500 --> 01:52:14,170
I know the lengths people go to with the
whole Russian anti doping program was

4324
01:52:14,200 --> 01:52:14,920
horseshit.

4325
01:52:14,920 --> 01:52:15,880
They were just doping people,

4326
01:52:15,881 --> 01:52:17,110
state sponsored doping,

4327
01:52:17,530 --> 01:52:20,770
and that the fact that they had rigged
the Sochi Olympics so that they,

4328
01:52:20,830 --> 01:52:22,480
they got fake piss.

4329
01:52:22,850 --> 01:52:25,900
And you think that the only
country doing that China did it.

4330
01:52:26,100 --> 01:52:26,681
Oh for sure.

4331
01:52:26,681 --> 01:52:27,940
They still did it on the paging.

4332
01:52:27,970 --> 01:52:29,710
China's like they were breaking gold,

4333
01:52:29,711 --> 01:52:31,120
red gold medals.

4334
01:52:31,210 --> 01:52:32,620
And I think it's funny
how people are like,

4335
01:52:32,621 --> 01:52:33,730
this is ridiculous.

4336
01:52:33,731 --> 01:52:34,541
How could Russia do it?

4337
01:52:34,541 --> 01:52:34,780
I'm like,

4338
01:52:34,780 --> 01:52:35,450
oh my God,

4339
01:52:35,450 --> 01:52:35,860
everyone.

4340
01:52:35,860 --> 01:52:36,730
Or even with John,

4341
01:52:36,731 --> 01:52:37,564
like I don't,

4342
01:52:37,720 --> 01:52:38,700
I don't eat,

4343
01:52:38,830 --> 01:52:41,920
let's say John did do some illegal shit
that we don't know and he got away.

4344
01:52:41,950 --> 01:52:43,420
I don't give a fuck dude.

4345
01:52:43,510 --> 01:52:44,320
I really don't.

4346
01:52:44,320 --> 01:52:45,770
I think a lot of guys are doing things.

4347
01:52:45,771 --> 01:52:46,040
I D

4348
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:48,740
I think it's part of
every professional sport.

4349
01:52:48,980 --> 01:52:49,551
NFL,

4350
01:52:49,551 --> 01:52:50,300
NBA,

4351
01:52:50,300 --> 01:52:51,133
Nhl,

4352
01:52:51,260 --> 01:52:52,280
especially fighting.

4353
01:52:52,281 --> 01:52:52,700
It's just,

4354
01:52:52,700 --> 01:52:53,960
that's the nature of the beast.

4355
01:52:54,020 --> 01:52:54,231
Well,

4356
01:52:54,231 --> 01:52:55,670
it's certainly a nature.

4357
01:52:56,060 --> 01:52:56,940
I mean it's definitely a,

4358
01:52:56,941 --> 01:52:57,860
comes with the territory.

4359
01:52:57,890 --> 01:52:59,690
It's definitely far
sports because it works.

4360
01:53:00,140 --> 01:53:03,530
You know what's interesting is like why
is it okay to take regular creatine,

4361
01:53:03,830 --> 01:53:07,250
regular creatine works probably
as good as micro dosing.

4362
01:53:07,251 --> 01:53:08,900
Any of this bullshit where be surprised,

4363
01:53:08,901 --> 01:53:09,440
but yeah.

4364
01:53:09,440 --> 01:53:09,940
Yeah.

4365
01:53:09,940 --> 01:53:10,830
I think they,

4366
01:53:10,831 --> 01:53:14,350
there's some microdosing shit out there
that the NFL guys can get their hands on

4367
01:53:14,351 --> 01:53:15,500
or MLB that you're like,

4368
01:53:15,501 --> 01:53:18,050
God damn well they say that micro dosing,

4369
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:23,080
actual testosterone is more effective
because microdosing actual testosterone

4370
01:53:23,751 --> 01:53:28,340
doesn't produce any random weird
metabolites and that's what God was doing.

4371
01:53:28,341 --> 01:53:30,570
He had like gummy bears
were riding a four.

4372
01:53:30,571 --> 01:53:31,341
He'd bat and he's like,

4373
01:53:31,341 --> 01:53:32,360
pop this gummy bear,

4374
01:53:32,380 --> 01:53:33,190
this bag.

4375
01:53:33,190 --> 01:53:33,860
Hold on.

4376
01:53:33,860 --> 01:53:35,450
And then by the time
test them after the game.

4377
01:53:35,450 --> 01:53:36,200
He's good.

4378
01:53:36,200 --> 01:53:37,490
That's so crazy.

4379
01:53:38,330 --> 01:53:39,163
So crazy.

4380
01:53:39,200 --> 01:53:41,120
How much did they take
away from him after that?

4381
01:53:41,270 --> 01:53:42,081
Oh my God,

4382
01:53:42,081 --> 01:53:42,410
man.

4383
01:53:42,410 --> 01:53:42,680
His,

4384
01:53:42,680 --> 01:53:44,150
the whole legacy was tarnished.

4385
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:46,050
Were were you with me in Vegas Time?

4386
01:53:46,051 --> 01:53:51,051
We at Strip steak house and a rod was
there and he was like to smoke shows and

4387
01:53:51,801 --> 01:53:52,670
no one like,

4388
01:53:52,671 --> 01:53:53,170
everyone's like really?

4389
01:53:53,170 --> 01:53:54,320
That fucking guy.

4390
01:53:54,500 --> 01:53:55,400
Where are you there with me?

4391
01:53:55,460 --> 01:53:55,971
Oh No,

4392
01:53:55,971 --> 01:54:00,290
I forget everyone at the table's like
fuck back and like why he's awesome.

4393
01:54:00,680 --> 01:54:01,910
Like do all the steroids and like,

4394
01:54:02,220 --> 01:54:02,650
yeah,

4395
01:54:02,650 --> 01:54:03,830
played baseball.

4396
01:54:03,831 --> 01:54:05,120
Everyone's on steroids.

4397
01:54:05,300 --> 01:54:06,680
You hate him because of that.

4398
01:54:06,681 --> 01:54:07,820
That's a funny thing though,

4399
01:54:07,821 --> 01:54:09,170
that you're a cheater thing.

4400
01:54:09,620 --> 01:54:13,490
Like that was the thing with mark
McGwire and Sammy Sosa hate to tell you,

4401
01:54:13,491 --> 01:54:14,960
the guy's pitching the ball to them.

4402
01:54:14,990 --> 01:54:16,340
Also juice to the gills.

4403
01:54:16,370 --> 01:54:19,460
It fuck with Sammy Sosa so much he
turned himself into a white guy and went,

4404
01:54:19,461 --> 01:54:20,240
fuck this noise.

4405
01:54:20,240 --> 01:54:20,930
I'm going white.

4406
01:54:20,930 --> 01:54:21,321
Go on.

4407
01:54:21,321 --> 01:54:22,130
Super White.

4408
01:54:22,130 --> 01:54:26,120
Went ultra camouflage not working cause
he sticks out even more now he's still

4409
01:54:26,121 --> 01:54:28,940
doing interviews and she
dresses what is going on.

4410
01:54:28,941 --> 01:54:29,070
No,

4411
01:54:29,070 --> 01:54:31,880
he does interviews but just
assumed like it's all good.

4412
01:54:32,030 --> 01:54:34,110
He's like dressing up like
the plant and makes sense man.

4413
01:54:34,520 --> 01:54:35,353
Yeah he is.

4414
01:54:35,630 --> 01:54:36,650
And then when someone brings it up,

4415
01:54:36,651 --> 01:54:36,921
he's like,

4416
01:54:36,921 --> 01:54:37,520
what?

4417
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:37,770
What do,

4418
01:54:37,770 --> 01:54:38,760
what do you mean what's
wrong with this guy?

4419
01:54:38,761 --> 01:54:40,400
And I just used the lotion
that people are like,

4420
01:54:40,670 --> 01:54:42,230
well you're white bro.

4421
01:54:42,231 --> 01:54:42,770
And he's like,

4422
01:54:42,770 --> 01:54:43,610
what about it?

4423
01:54:43,770 --> 01:54:44,070
Yeah,

4424
01:54:44,070 --> 01:54:45,080
I like to look like this.

4425
01:54:45,081 --> 01:54:45,681
Like no,

4426
01:54:45,681 --> 01:54:45,981
I know.

4427
01:54:45,981 --> 01:54:47,270
But what the fuck are you doing?

4428
01:54:47,310 --> 01:54:47,541
He's like,

4429
01:54:47,541 --> 01:54:50,450
leaching yourself with
just straight up low shit.

4430
01:54:50,480 --> 01:54:52,850
Do you think he has spots on his
back that he can't reach now?

4431
01:54:52,851 --> 01:54:54,020
I bet as girls and she's like,

4432
01:54:54,021 --> 01:54:54,171
dude,

4433
01:54:54,171 --> 01:54:55,520
we can't have these fucking spots.

4434
01:54:55,520 --> 01:54:57,640
Like your Goddamn
Dalmatian back of his dude.

4435
01:54:57,660 --> 01:54:58,860
Hop out his dead.

4436
01:54:59,210 --> 01:55:01,520
There's no way all his
dick wrinkles aren't black.

4437
01:55:02,330 --> 01:55:06,110
Like you're not going to get all that
probably looks like help drain the

4438
01:55:06,260 --> 01:55:07,041
whitening stuff.

4439
01:55:07,041 --> 01:55:09,860
Do you have to to get all the
nooks and crannies of the day?

4440
01:55:09,880 --> 01:55:10,820
You don't have the tape.

4441
01:55:11,570 --> 01:55:14,450
Do you get your asshole bleached could
match if you have a black hole for an

4442
01:55:14,451 --> 01:55:17,150
asshole like everything else is.

4443
01:55:17,151 --> 01:55:21,240
There's just spots all over
something to think about fro.

4444
01:55:21,570 --> 01:55:22,403
It's just,

4445
01:55:22,670 --> 01:55:23,481
Oh wow,

4446
01:55:23,481 --> 01:55:24,590
look how wide he is.

4447
01:55:24,680 --> 01:55:25,491
He doesn't look bad there,

4448
01:55:25,491 --> 01:55:26,690
but it looks like he's wearing makeup.

4449
01:55:26,770 --> 01:55:28,040
Felt good.

4450
01:55:28,200 --> 01:55:30,860
He looks like like we got
them Dick Tracy character.

4451
01:55:31,280 --> 01:55:32,660
It looks weird because you know what?

4452
01:55:32,661 --> 01:55:35,810
Like the inside of his eyelids,

4453
01:55:36,290 --> 01:55:38,240
like that's dark.

4454
01:55:39,140 --> 01:55:39,621
You know what I'm saying?

4455
01:55:39,621 --> 01:55:42,140
Because you can't really
get the whitening cream.

4456
01:55:42,270 --> 01:55:44,100
He looks like a God van Pyre.

4457
01:55:44,130 --> 01:55:46,050
You can't get the whitening cream to your,

4458
01:55:46,080 --> 01:55:46,291
well,

4459
01:55:46,291 --> 01:55:48,720
if he was a regular guy and
that's what he looked like,

4460
01:55:48,721 --> 01:55:49,501
that'd be normal.

4461
01:55:49,501 --> 01:55:50,450
I mean that's like Joey Diaz,

4462
01:55:50,460 --> 01:55:51,293
the skin color,

4463
01:55:51,660 --> 01:55:53,700
but it's like you get to his eyeliner,

4464
01:55:53,730 --> 01:55:54,810
go to his eyeballs,

4465
01:55:55,320 --> 01:55:56,153
make that larger.

4466
01:55:56,700 --> 01:55:57,960
Like look around.

4467
01:55:57,961 --> 01:56:00,750
His eye is dark and his ear lobes.

4468
01:56:01,260 --> 01:56:01,351
Oh,

4469
01:56:01,351 --> 01:56:01,951
that's weird.

4470
01:56:01,951 --> 01:56:03,090
The ear lobes are freaking me out,

4471
01:56:04,290 --> 01:56:05,490
but at the end,

4472
01:56:05,491 --> 01:56:06,900
the inside of his nostrils.

4473
01:56:07,020 --> 01:56:07,501
Oh yeah.

4474
01:56:07,501 --> 01:56:09,000
You can't look at the darkness.

4475
01:56:09,030 --> 01:56:10,140
It's a nightmare.

4476
01:56:10,290 --> 01:56:10,621
Well,

4477
01:56:10,621 --> 01:56:10,761
Hey,

4478
01:56:10,761 --> 01:56:11,340
strange.

4479
01:56:11,340 --> 01:56:12,173
He digs it.

4480
01:56:12,330 --> 01:56:13,081
I guess he likes you to,

4481
01:56:13,081 --> 01:56:13,914
how bout happy?

4482
01:56:14,070 --> 01:56:14,550
How bout,

4483
01:56:14,550 --> 01:56:18,540
how hard were we howling at Joey Diaz
story the other night at the comedy store?

4484
01:56:18,541 --> 01:56:19,110
Mark,

4485
01:56:19,110 --> 01:56:19,541
I'm telling you,

4486
01:56:19,541 --> 01:56:20,810
you fucked up my ribs.

4487
01:56:21,420 --> 01:56:22,440
That's what he used to look like.

4488
01:56:22,750 --> 01:56:23,820
Oh my gosh.

4489
01:56:23,990 --> 01:56:24,823
She was a black guy.

4490
01:56:25,170 --> 01:56:25,680
Oh yeah,

4491
01:56:25,680 --> 01:56:29,170
black cube did he held court last
night to same spot on the kitchen.

4492
01:56:29,700 --> 01:56:30,840
Oh my God.

4493
01:56:31,410 --> 01:56:33,090
He told a story about him taking a shit.

4494
01:56:33,120 --> 01:56:34,500
I sent me a picture of his shit.

4495
01:56:34,530 --> 01:56:34,861
Me Too.

4496
01:56:34,861 --> 01:56:35,970
The next morning we woke up,

4497
01:56:35,971 --> 01:56:36,960
he sent us pictures of his shit.

4498
01:56:36,961 --> 01:56:37,270
He goes,

4499
01:56:37,270 --> 01:56:38,650
this is

4500
01:56:40,790 --> 01:56:41,623
stop about how he,

4501
01:56:41,640 --> 01:56:42,420
how he's eating.

4502
01:56:42,420 --> 01:56:43,280
This isn't a bit right.

4503
01:56:43,290 --> 01:56:47,550
He's that he's eating sauerkraut and
farting on the crane and Lauren hills.

4504
01:56:47,551 --> 01:56:47,701
Like,

4505
01:56:47,701 --> 01:56:48,810
what the fuck man,

4506
01:56:48,840 --> 01:56:49,220
dude.

4507
01:56:49,220 --> 01:56:49,440
Yeah.

4508
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:49,980
I was floored.

4509
01:56:49,980 --> 01:56:52,000
I was sweating in my mind.

4510
01:56:52,320 --> 01:56:52,771
I'm telling you.

4511
01:56:52,771 --> 01:56:53,551
That's why I woke up.

4512
01:56:53,551 --> 01:56:54,090
I'm like,

4513
01:56:54,090 --> 01:56:55,440
did I get punched in the ribs?

4514
01:56:55,441 --> 01:56:55,590
Like,

4515
01:56:55,590 --> 01:56:56,430
oh no fucking,

4516
01:56:56,550 --> 01:56:57,121
I texted her.

4517
01:56:57,121 --> 01:56:57,361
I'm like,

4518
01:56:57,361 --> 01:56:57,601
dude,

4519
01:56:57,601 --> 01:56:58,141
your story.

4520
01:56:58,141 --> 01:56:58,921
Fuck my ribs up.

4521
01:56:58,921 --> 01:57:00,670
Last night I had a runaway.

4522
01:57:00,720 --> 01:57:01,740
I was about to go on stage.

4523
01:57:01,741 --> 01:57:04,380
I had a runaway from him before because
I wouldn't have been able to think about

4524
01:57:04,381 --> 01:57:05,070
when material.

4525
01:57:05,070 --> 01:57:05,210
Oh,

4526
01:57:05,210 --> 01:57:07,260
I would have a think about
what you're talking about.

4527
01:57:07,320 --> 01:57:08,790
I was laughing so hard.

4528
01:57:09,090 --> 01:57:09,923
He's the goat.

4529
01:57:10,870 --> 01:57:12,040
I gotta wrap this on my bed.

4530
01:57:12,060 --> 01:57:12,990
You get the fuck out.

4531
01:57:13,010 --> 01:57:13,980
You got the FBI guy.

4532
01:57:13,981 --> 01:57:14,814
CIA.

4533
01:57:14,820 --> 01:57:15,653
CIA.

4534
01:57:15,660 --> 01:57:16,050
Yeah.

4535
01:57:16,050 --> 01:57:16,831
A little different than me.

4536
01:57:16,831 --> 01:57:17,490
Huh?

4537
01:57:17,490 --> 01:57:20,280
Maybe talk to him about fucking Pecos.

4538
01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:21,320
See what he says about them.

4539
01:57:21,690 --> 01:57:22,710
I'm all out picos right now.

4540
01:57:22,740 --> 01:57:23,760
I don't know why I can't.

4541
01:57:23,761 --> 01:57:24,510
It's just in my head.

4542
01:57:24,510 --> 01:57:24,721
Well,

4543
01:57:24,721 --> 01:57:24,990
it's,

4544
01:57:24,990 --> 01:57:26,670
it's a fun thing to run with and if it's,

4545
01:57:26,671 --> 01:57:26,971
he's like,

4546
01:57:26,971 --> 01:57:29,160
Jesus Christ show shut
the full Saturday night.

4547
01:57:29,430 --> 01:57:30,510
San Diego.

4548
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:32,160
You'd be surprised.

4549
01:57:32,161 --> 01:57:35,730
I know Brendan motherfucking
Shab Showtime Special.

4550
01:57:35,820 --> 01:57:36,181
That's right.

4551
01:57:36,181 --> 01:57:40,020
I'm running my one hour at flappers
in Burbank the night before on Friday.

4552
01:57:40,110 --> 01:57:41,340
Then you've been banging it out,

4553
01:57:41,341 --> 01:57:41,701
man.

4554
01:57:41,701 --> 01:57:45,540
You've been hitting the road hard Edmonton
everywhere you've been tr Torin grind

4555
01:57:45,541 --> 01:57:46,410
and punching it in.

4556
01:57:46,440 --> 01:57:47,270
Yes sir.

4557
01:57:47,270 --> 01:57:48,103
They excited.

4558
01:57:48,120 --> 01:57:49,500
I can't wait Saturday night.

4559
01:57:49,530 --> 01:57:50,190
We'll see ya.

4560
01:57:50,190 --> 01:57:50,421
Bye.

4561
01:57:50,421 --> 01:57:51,254
Or Buddy.

4562
01:58:01,960 --> 01:58:02,210
Okay.
