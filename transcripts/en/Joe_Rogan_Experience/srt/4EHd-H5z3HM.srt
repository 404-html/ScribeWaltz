1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,260
Her low freak bitches.
I've,

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:07,840
I've taught that story is crazy.
I was telling a friend of mine about it,

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:08,441
the,
uh,

4
00:00:08,441 --> 00:00:09,274
the story of you,
you were in Alberta and you shot an elk 

5
00:00:12,101 --> 00:00:15,190
and these wolves circled the elk.
How many,

6
00:00:15,191 --> 00:00:16,024
how many?

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,570
Well,
at first there was just the one,

8
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:24,900
the one came in and you know,
the one came in on us and I,

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,353
and I,
and that's one I do want to say off the 

10
00:00:27,881 --> 00:00:28,714
beginning.
One thing that I always do as a hunter 

11
00:00:30,971 --> 00:00:34,420
is I always buy a Predator tag if it's 
available,

12
00:00:34,421 --> 00:00:36,530
if I know that I can get,
uh,

13
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,250
that I can buy a tag for coyotes or 
wolves,

14
00:00:39,251 --> 00:00:42,760
I always have one in my pocket.
Because you do see,

15
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:43,653
you know,
they're out there and they're out there 

16
00:00:44,471 --> 00:00:45,304
way more now and this,
and this is an exact reason why he got 

17
00:00:49,111 --> 00:00:49,944
to do it because literally we had an elk
down and next thing you know we're out 

18
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:55,660
there kind of,
you know,

19
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,440
getting it ready to like,
you know,

20
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:02,940
to cut it up and stuff and get it out of
there and all sudden this big wolf comes

21
00:01:03,101 --> 00:01:03,600
through,
you know,

22
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,120
it comes in and I had spotted it and we 
weren't really being noisy.

23
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,400
So I ended up shooting that wolf and it 
kind of went off.

24
00:01:12,401 --> 00:01:14,710
And you know,
with a bow there's no noise.

25
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:19,830
So what we didn't realize was there was 
a pack there and that that was actually,

26
00:01:20,441 --> 00:01:23,680
it was an Alpha female is because of the
size of it.

27
00:01:23,681 --> 00:01:24,514
I mean,
you saw the size of it is a big as me 

28
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:31,270
and it actually went off and then we 
kind of thought,

29
00:01:31,271 --> 00:01:32,560
wow,
it's freaking freaky.

30
00:01:32,561 --> 00:01:33,394
We'll then about 20 minutes later all 
sudden we see another one and we see 

31
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:39,940
another one and we're kinda like,
holy crap.

32
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,313
So we start moving into this draw and 
one of them was like making like a 

33
00:01:45,311 --> 00:01:48,190
noise,
almost like it was injured or something.

34
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,750
And I was like whimpering.
So we're like,

35
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,070
what is the deal?
So we,

36
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,173
we were on high ground with the elk and 
then we started moving down into this 

37
00:01:55,481 --> 00:01:58,810
ravine because we saw the wolves down in
there.

38
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,850
And next thing you know,
we get down in there and I start looking

39
00:02:03,851 --> 00:02:06,430
around and there's like hair on the 
trees.

40
00:02:06,431 --> 00:02:07,264
There's like,
I mean it looked like that movie into 

41
00:02:09,191 --> 00:02:10,510
the gray,
the gray,

42
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,270
the gray,
that's exactly what it looked like.

43
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,133
Liam Neeson,
there was like fricking Harry turds 

44
00:02:16,211 --> 00:02:17,650
everywhere.
It was just,

45
00:02:17,651 --> 00:02:20,410
there was like beds,
there was hair rubbed on the trees.

46
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:24,640
And I started looking around and there's
like holes dug in and I'm like,

47
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,900
I literally look at my two buddies that 
were there with me and I said,

48
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,810
right.
And they're fricking den like,

49
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,733
you know,
and I think we had that elk was not too 

50
00:02:34,361 --> 00:02:35,141
far,
you know,

51
00:02:35,141 --> 00:02:35,974
our elk wasn't too far.
You shot an elk that they probably 

52
00:02:38,711 --> 00:02:40,240
thought of as theirs.
Oh,

53
00:02:40,241 --> 00:02:42,010
they definitely thought of it was 
theirs.

54
00:02:42,011 --> 00:02:42,680
Yeah,
they,

55
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,680
they definitely thought that was theirs.
So then once we're down there all sudden

56
00:02:48,311 --> 00:02:50,860
we hear this,
how were like down there,

57
00:02:50,861 --> 00:02:51,694
we hear this how,
and it was definitely an Alpha because 

58
00:02:53,681 --> 00:02:55,840
an Alphas,
the how,

59
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:01,110
it literally turns your blood instantly 
if you're right in on a true wolf howl.

60
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,660
It's,
I mean it's like,

61
00:03:04,661 --> 00:03:09,250
so freaking low and deep and it's just 
like chills your blood.

62
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:10,811
Well,
yeah.

63
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:11,980
Then I realized,
I'm like,

64
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:13,990
we're in their fricking Dan and you 
know,

65
00:03:13,991 --> 00:03:15,280
I'm kind of looking down.
I'm like,

66
00:03:15,281 --> 00:03:16,600
okay,
well shot an elk.

67
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,180
Then I shot that.
I've got two arrows left.

68
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,640
So,
and you know,

69
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:23,770
both my guides kind of had,
you know,

70
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:24,880
once we said,
oh,

71
00:03:24,881 --> 00:03:25,714
there's wolves,
they like grabbed a gun and we kind of 

72
00:03:26,951 --> 00:03:30,550
went down in there to see what was up.
Well now this happens.

73
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,220
A next thing after that Alpha sounded 
off,

74
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,940
it was like,

75
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,870
Ooh,
Ooh.

76
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,553
And I mean 12,
I think it was 12 sounded off all the 

77
00:03:41,411 --> 00:03:43,120
way around us.
We're in,

78
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:43,720
uh,
we're,

79
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,090
we're literally down.
Anyone who's been in Alberta,

80
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:50,710
you know that the farm land is level and
then it falls into the river system.

81
00:03:50,711 --> 00:03:54,010
So we're literally,
they have the high ground,

82
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:57,280
there's a dozen wolves and we're in the 
middle and we're like,

83
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,870
what the crap.
So I just,

84
00:03:58,871 --> 00:03:59,704
I'm like,
get you back to a tree so we can all 

85
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:01,924
spin around and we're sitting there and 
next thing you know here comes to dogs 

86
00:04:06,491 --> 00:04:10,690
on a full blown,
I'm talking like full blown like this,

87
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:15,250
like front running coming.
And I mean it turned into chaos.

88
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:16,084
There was like bullets flying.
I mean there's fricking arrows skipping 

89
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:19,324
off junk.
And we ended up shooting both of those 

90
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,083
wolves dead and there's a few gunfires 
going off while I'm down to like one 

91
00:04:27,671 --> 00:04:30,910
Arrow left and I told the guy said how 
many bullets you got?

92
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,330
And he goes,
well I didn't,

93
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:34,711
I,
you know,

94
00:04:34,711 --> 00:04:35,544
I just grabbed the gun to couple bullets
like I didn't know were this was all 

95
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,870
going down,
so it can't,

96
00:04:40,871 --> 00:04:42,760
we're kind of like,
we need to get outta here.

97
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:45,280
So we started backing up and next thing 
you know they,

98
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,233
the Alpha sounded off again and they all
reported this time there's only two or 

99
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:56,350
two less.
So next thing I know I'm like kind of,

100
00:04:56,351 --> 00:04:58,140
we're trying to back out.
So when you say that,

101
00:04:58,141 --> 00:04:58,930
wait a minute,
hold on a second.

102
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,770
You say they reported there's,
so there's,

103
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,280
they know that two were dead.
Yeah,

104
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:07,630
all of them are Howlin.
I'm certain that the first,

105
00:05:07,631 --> 00:05:08,464
how was the Alpha male?
Pretty much saying is everyone in 

106
00:05:13,931 --> 00:05:17,560
position because then they all like,
yes,

107
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,150
yes.
All the way around.

108
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,440
Then all of a sudden the two come,
all hell breaks loose.

109
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:28,780
Then we're like the alpha sounds again,
but he's in a different location.

110
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,840
He was actually to my left like right 
here and it really close and I mean it's

111
00:05:34,571 --> 00:05:36,100
thick in there.
You've been there,

112
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:39,310
you know how thick it gets.
So then they sound awful.

113
00:05:39,311 --> 00:05:44,311
Now this time there's two less.
So I'm kind of looking,

114
00:05:45,701 --> 00:05:49,420
cause I know this wolf that sounded was,
and I know it's the Alpha,

115
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:52,870
so I like grabbed my bow and I start 
kinda creeping over there.

116
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:57,900
And as soon as I get to where I can see,
he's like fricking standing right there.

117
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:03,850
And how far were 30 yards,
which actually both can cover.

118
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,280
Jamie,
pull up that picture from,

119
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:11,690
I'm Joe's instagram.
Like it was about a week ago.

120
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,670
You found those pictures of those 
wolves?

121
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,320
Yeah.
I forget who the photographer was.

122
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:18,320
There's got some amazing photographs or 
yeah,

123
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,213
it was,
it was like not the most recent one on 

124
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:24,620
that was on that dead Moose,
but it was from national geographic.

125
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,930
That was actually a bison.
Those from yesterday.

126
00:06:26,931 --> 00:06:28,920
That's right.
Yesterday or the day before.

127
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:29,783
Look at that right there.
That is exactly the face that I saw in 

128
00:06:36,381 --> 00:06:37,850
the,
but he was head on.

129
00:06:37,851 --> 00:06:38,684
He wasn't broad side,
but that face where he was literally 

130
00:06:41,571 --> 00:06:42,404
looking at me like that and I mean 
you're in a fight or flight like I'm in 

131
00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:49,610
totally in a fight or flight.
I had one arrow left on my string.

132
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,640
I fricking grabbed my bow.
I literally,

133
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,050
I like,
I just,

134
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:57,980
I kind of looked at him.
I knew at that moment it was like he was

135
00:06:57,981 --> 00:06:58,671
coming.
Yeah.

136
00:06:58,671 --> 00:07:02,160
That's it's like fricking Deja Vu,
right?

137
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,070
The twitter,
the instagram page,

138
00:07:04,071 --> 00:07:04,904
Jamie,
to go back up a little bit is c j m 

139
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:11,090
underscore photography and if you go to 
that guy's instagram page,

140
00:07:11,091 --> 00:07:15,500
he's got an amazing photographs just,
and he's out there with them.

141
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:18,560
There was another one that I had and 
it's just right before that Jamie,

142
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,240
the,
before that wolf picture,

143
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:22,070
there was another wolf picture.
That one.

144
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,113
Look at that one man,
he's got snow all over his face and his 

145
00:07:25,251 --> 00:07:26,840
teeth are bare.
That's a cool,

146
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,610
yeah,
that's a cool picture.

147
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,270
Like to me that's pretty cool.
Wools are amazing.

148
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,133
They're amazing.
And the one thing people underestimate 

149
00:07:34,851 --> 00:07:36,910
about hunters is our respect for 
animals.

150
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,090
I freaking,
I totally respect him.

151
00:07:41,091 --> 00:07:41,924
I love him.
But I can tell you that other picture 

152
00:07:42,831 --> 00:07:46,130
right there when you have that looking 
at you in the face,

153
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,083
I mean,
I knew it was like fricking do or die 

154
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,023
and I,
I literally looked at that thing and I 

155
00:07:51,651 --> 00:07:53,240
said out loud,
I said,

156
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,530
I'm going to shoot you in theF and face 
because you don't swear.

157
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,430
Yeah,
sorry.

158
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,660
It's cute.
And my boy might listen.

159
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,880
I remember I drew back.
Oh.

160
00:08:04,881 --> 00:08:09,680
Like I literally drew back and I 
anchored and that came into my peep.

161
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:11,863
And as soon means for people don't know,
there's like a little circle that you 

162
00:08:14,751 --> 00:08:17,750
look at through the string line lining 
up with your site.

163
00:08:17,751 --> 00:08:21,320
So I was literally lining up the shot,
lining up the shot,

164
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:25,910
and as soon as I kind of brought my shot
down to where that wolf was,

165
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,070
there was nothing there.
He bolted.

166
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,420
No,
I think he just like,

167
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,470
yeah,
like Ninja ad.

168
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:35,660
If they're that wise and that big and 
that old,

169
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:40,310
they've got to know what smarter.
It had to have known that you killed the

170
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,144
elk and they had to have known that you 
killed those other two wolves that 

171
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:48,041
chased you went after the ALC.
I think he came in to to think,

172
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,040
okay,
we've see you called the fight.

173
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,090
We responded.
Now he's like sizing up.

174
00:08:57,091 --> 00:08:59,100
Okay,
I've lost.

175
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,570
Here's what I've lost.
I want to know what I'm going against.

176
00:09:03,571 --> 00:09:08,571
He kind of came in and he fricking 
looked at us all and then that was it.

177
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,750
Good thing they can't count for you.
Who you only had two hours.

178
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,420
Yeah,
two hours and two bullets.

179
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,990
Bullets the guy up.
It was bone chilling.

180
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,220
And I mean,
I have,

181
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:25,140
you and I both have friends that are you
grizzlies cats.

182
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,033
I mean,
cats are notorious for stalking hunters 

183
00:09:27,721 --> 00:09:28,560
too.
Cause I mean,

184
00:09:28,561 --> 00:09:31,270
they are the ultimate hunter.
Um,

185
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:34,260
but grizzlies and wolves,
I mean,

186
00:09:34,261 --> 00:09:37,120
there you have to be on guard that,
you know,

187
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,270
there's places now we're,
you know,

188
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,360
grizzlies are strongly becoming such a 
problem when it comes to,

189
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,700
you know,
they have to be controlled.

190
00:09:47,701 --> 00:09:49,660
They're just starting to get to be too 
many for,

191
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,180
especially for the food source.
