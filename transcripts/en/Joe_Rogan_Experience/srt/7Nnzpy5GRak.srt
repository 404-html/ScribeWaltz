1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,950
Four,
three,

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,080
two,
one.

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:05,820
Boom.
And we're live.

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,890
Candice Owens.
How are you doing?

5
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:08,940
I'm good.
How are you?

6
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,530
I'm very good.
Thank you.

7
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,350
Thank you for asking.
A lot of controversy these days.

8
00:00:13,351 --> 00:00:15,930
Candice,
I guess a little bit in the twitter

9
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:17,280
verse the world.
Yeah.

10
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,830
Just everybody's excited about being
outraged.

11
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:20,611
Yeah,
exactly.

12
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:23,340
That's exactly right.
This controversy every five seconds.

13
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,020
You know,
I had a guy on before,

14
00:00:25,021 --> 00:00:27,480
the guy that you just met,
a Dr Robert Schoch.

15
00:00:27,481 --> 00:00:32,010
He's a geologist from Boston University
and he is a part of this,

16
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:35,190
uh,
backdating of the ancient,

17
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,010
uh,
the history of Egypt and they're talking

18
00:00:38,011 --> 00:00:39,120
about,
you know,

19
00:00:39,121 --> 00:00:41,610
all these different structures that
might be thousands and thousands of

20
00:00:41,611 --> 00:00:45,030
years older than people think they are.
And one of the things that he's working

21
00:00:45,031 --> 00:00:50,031
on is that there was coronal mass
ejections from the sun somewhere around

22
00:00:51,271 --> 00:00:55,140
10,000 years ago that basically killed
off a giant percentage of the population

23
00:00:55,141 --> 00:00:57,270
on the planet.
Lightening storms millions of times

24
00:00:57,271 --> 00:00:59,100
greater than anything we've ever
experienced before.

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,440
That literally,
which like lightning coming down,

26
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:03,300
like rain,
barbecuing the ground,

27
00:01:03,301 --> 00:01:06,000
killing people,
people forst indicates civilization

28
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,150
resets.
It's almost like we need something like

29
00:01:09,151 --> 00:01:13,530
that to really be upset about because
instead of being upset about Roseanne or

30
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:16,950
Samantha Bee or Samantha Bee,
use the c word today,

31
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:17,784
that Nadia

32
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:22,610
chest outrage culture.
I say everyone should just wait like 48

33
00:01:22,611 --> 00:01:25,790
hours if everybody hates you and then
there'll be onto the next person that

34
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:26,620
they have.

35
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,360
Yeah.
Well that's one of the cool things about

36
00:01:28,361 --> 00:01:30,220
the Internet is the cycle.
Boy,

37
00:01:30,221 --> 00:01:32,080
it hits you hard,
but then it goes back

38
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:33,310
really fast.
Yeah.

39
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,080
It's never that serious

40
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,860
sound like the old days when someone got
in trouble with something.

41
00:01:37,861 --> 00:01:39,060
Boy,
that trouble stuck.

42
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,820
No,
I don't know that time.

43
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,560
I,
I genuinely don't know that time.

44
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,820
How old are you?
Twenty nine.

45
00:01:44,821 --> 00:01:46,740
I just turned 29.
So you're very,

46
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,290
very young in the shit stirring culture.
Yeah,

47
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,270
exactly.
This is all new stuff to you.

48
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,320
It's new.
Yeah,

49
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:55,800
and I think the thing that sucks for me
is that I'm really conscious of it.

50
00:01:55,801 --> 00:01:57,510
Like I wish I thought all of this was
normal.

51
00:01:57,511 --> 00:02:00,330
It would be easier,
but like even when I do things like just

52
00:02:00,331 --> 00:02:01,260
before this I was like,
oh,

53
00:02:01,261 --> 00:02:03,570
let me do an instagram story that I'm
about to go on.

54
00:02:03,571 --> 00:02:04,171
Joe Rogan.
I'm like,

55
00:02:04,171 --> 00:02:06,270
hey guys,
like we under Grogan.

56
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:06,991
I'm like,
how weird.

57
00:02:06,991 --> 00:02:11,940
I'm like holding my phone in the middle
of talking to this device you're aware

58
00:02:11,941 --> 00:02:14,190
of.
It's that kind of sucks that I'm aware

59
00:02:14,191 --> 00:02:14,780
of it.
Like I.

60
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,340
It would be so much more natural if I
wasn't aware of it,

61
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,680
you know,
girls that just hey guys,

62
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:24,090
and they all day and it feels normal.
So being conscious of it is kind of not

63
00:02:24,091 --> 00:02:26,850
that fun.
That's probably the best way to approach

64
00:02:26,851 --> 00:02:28,740
it though,
to be conscious of our goofy it is

65
00:02:28,741 --> 00:02:31,050
because if you just swept away in the
Zeitgeists,

66
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,930
I don't know.
I think it's basically ignorance is

67
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,270
bliss,
I think.

68
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,870
Yeah.
I think there are people that think it's

69
00:02:36,871 --> 00:02:41,130
the most normal thing in the world to
just put your entire life on social

70
00:02:41,131 --> 00:02:44,550
media and I actually don't think it's
the most normal thing in the world,

71
00:02:44,551 --> 00:02:46,380
but my entire life is on social media.

72
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,770
Well,
I've just met you,

73
00:02:47,771 --> 00:02:50,680
but you seem like a very bright woman
and that's probably part of the problem

74
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,690
is you're not stupid.
You're stupid.

75
00:02:52,691 --> 00:02:55,870
You'd be like putting everything on
instagram and you'd be.

76
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,850
Do you do the Selfie face?
This is my favorite.

77
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,980
This thing,
when

78
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,400
they do that weird thing with their neck
angle,

79
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,960
I'm really bad at selfies.
My cousin always has to take them if

80
00:03:07,961 --> 00:03:11,130
we're in the same picture,
but I'm getting good at my like

81
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,390
instagram angle and the things that I
say like,

82
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,220
Oh,
do you guys like this eyeshadow?

83
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,270
Like it's like it's,
it's that ridiculous.

84
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,300
My friend Cameron hanes loves you.
He saw you on Fox News.

85
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:23,230
He's like,
who's this girl?

86
00:03:23,231 --> 00:03:27,040
She's making so much sense.
He's like super hardcore conservative.

87
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:31,030
So he likes when anyone is like young
and conservative,

88
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,310
like loves Ben Shapiro.
He loves all that Shit.

89
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:36,380
So you got excited about you.
People have been really excited.

90
00:03:36,381 --> 00:03:38,090
I think it's just because I,
I'm,

91
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:42,770
I'm really unapologetically myself and
today that's like,

92
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,540
it's like seeing an alien.

93
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,670
It's hard to pull off,
right?

94
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,440
Because people get mad at you.
People trying this,

95
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,390
this one thing that is absolutely
happening,

96
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:53,480
whether people like it or not or believe
it or not it people are trying to

97
00:03:53,481 --> 00:03:58,481
silence other people's opinions.
If you say something that doesn't jive

98
00:03:58,761 --> 00:04:00,050
with them,
instead of saying,

99
00:04:00,051 --> 00:04:01,880
wow,
this lady's kind of out there,

100
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,950
or she's saying some shit that I'm not
sure I agree with.

101
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,630
Instead of that,

102
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,860
they're like,
fire her.

103
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,490
Get her off here.
You know what?

104
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,360
Boycott boycott.
Which was insane.

105
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,360
It's like,
do you really want someone to lose their

106
00:04:13,361 --> 00:04:16,300
job if you didn't like a tweet?
Like how weird or some of these

107
00:04:16,301 --> 00:04:18,490
situations I'll make you really want
this person not to able to feed their

108
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:20,710
family because you don't like a tweet.
People are crazy.

109
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,070
Just they find targets and they want to
go after him.

110
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,570
There was a bunch of people that were
writing,

111
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,930
writing boycott.
Joe Rogan because I was talking about

112
00:04:27,931 --> 00:04:29,940
having Roseanne Barr on the show
tomorrow.

113
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,110
It's insane.
I know and it's like she just.

114
00:04:32,111 --> 00:04:33,900
She doesn't have a right to speak.
Genuine.

115
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,330
Can't even talk.
She can't even talk.

116
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,190
Even though I'm sure you don't agree
with.

117
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,720
I don't agree with what she said,
right,

118
00:04:38,721 --> 00:04:42,710
but the idea that she can't like have a
conversation after that to me is like

119
00:04:42,711 --> 00:04:44,150
the most bizarre thing in the entire
world,

120
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:48,110
but that is what outrage culture is.
It's like they need you off the island.

121
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,040
He doesn't even agree with what she said
and she apologized and nobody cares.

122
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,460
She's taken all kinds of
antidepressants.

123
00:04:56,461 --> 00:04:59,700
She's drinking.
She's fucked out of her head and like my

124
00:04:59,701 --> 00:05:03,270
mom took ambien.
She just told me about this today.

125
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:05,820
I forgot I forgot about the store
because I was telling her the story

126
00:05:05,821 --> 00:05:08,160
about another friend of mine on the
podcast yesterday.

127
00:05:08,161 --> 00:05:11,550
I talked about how a friend of mine got
on Ambien,

128
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,920
made a full meal,
cooked it,

129
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,330
ate it,
went to sleep,

130
00:05:15,331 --> 00:05:19,080
got up in the morning and had zero
recollection of it was in total denial

131
00:05:19,081 --> 00:05:19,914
of it.
It happens.

132
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:25,580
My mom told me that she went to bed,
got up in the morning and she had got up

133
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:30,950
and put red lipstick and I'm a and nail
Polish all over the white bathroom.

134
00:05:33,601 --> 00:05:38,200
Carpet was a little.
She's painted on it like a child now and

135
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,560
she had zero recollection of it.
She's like,

136
00:05:40,561 --> 00:05:43,200
this is scary shit.
Like she's painted like a little kid

137
00:05:43,201 --> 00:05:46,080
would like a two year old would get
ahold of your lipstick and start drawing

138
00:05:46,081 --> 00:05:48,240
on the walls.
She did that on this shag carpet.

139
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,540
Ambien is just like sleep look like.
It instantly brings you into sleep walk

140
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:53,490
and you can do anything you want.
Ambien.

141
00:05:53,491 --> 00:05:55,740
I,
I had a bunch of college friends who

142
00:05:55,741 --> 00:05:58,760
used to do ambien and bizarre stories
would just come out.

143
00:05:58,761 --> 00:06:01,310
I'm like very anti pills.
I don't take anything.

144
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,570
Nothing,
nothing at all.

145
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,010
No drink.
I don't drink.

146
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,230
I don't do any toddler.
I,

147
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,730
I mean I wasn't always.
I just,

148
00:06:07,731 --> 00:06:09,920
I kinda got,
I guess you could say it's like a little

149
00:06:09,921 --> 00:06:13,070
bit of paranoia,
but once I started down this journey of

150
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:14,210
realizing that like,
Whoa,

151
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,520
oh my God,
I lived for 26 years in my mind wasn't

152
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:18,320
my own.
Like I thought like being a liberal was

153
00:06:18,321 --> 00:06:20,960
okay and like everything that was said
on tv it was okay.

154
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,960
Then it's like very easy to sort of get
a little paranoid and go,

155
00:06:23,961 --> 00:06:25,160
okay,
well what else did I do?

156
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,150
I accept normally that is actually
retrospect to look a little weird and I

157
00:06:29,151 --> 00:06:30,770
started thinking about drinking.
I'm like,

158
00:06:30,771 --> 00:06:33,860
how can drinking possibly be the cure to
everything?

159
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,530
Like it's like you're getting married,
drink happy,

160
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:39,590
you're sad,
drink a little embarrassed,

161
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,930
have some drink,
right?

162
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,940
You want to come out of your shell drink
like no matter what emotion you have,

163
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,250
there's like a liquor designed for it.
So I was like,

164
00:06:46,251 --> 00:06:47,900
this is a little shady.
Like I don't know,

165
00:06:47,901 --> 00:06:51,080
I just feel like.
And I did like a little bit of math and

166
00:06:51,081 --> 00:06:55,150
I calculated that since I had started
drinking when I was 14 years old and I

167
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,120
look,
I would say like fair,

168
00:06:56,121 --> 00:06:58,010
like I drank every weekend,
probably more in college,

169
00:06:58,011 --> 00:06:59,600
maybe five days a week in college.
Right.

170
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,310
Then I was like,
wow,

171
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:04,790
I've technically drank for like three
years of my life and that feels weird,

172
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,670
so I'm just not going to drink any.
So you put in your time.

173
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:08,930
Yeah,
take a little break,

174
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:10,960
take a little break.
Yeah,

175
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,760
which is weird because now I go places
and I'm like,

176
00:07:13,761 --> 00:07:15,170
oh,
I don't drink and everyone gets really

177
00:07:15,171 --> 00:07:16,750
uncomfortable and they're like,
oh,

178
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,800
okay,
I'll have a glass of water.

179
00:07:18,801 --> 00:07:20,510
I'm like,
I'm an alcoholic.

180
00:07:20,511 --> 00:07:23,480
You can have a beer and no,
but um,

181
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,290
it's a weird way,
like if other people were drinking,

182
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:27,750
you don't do like,
Huh?

183
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,810
No,
I'm the weird one.

184
00:07:28,811 --> 00:07:29,650
Yeah.
Yeah,

185
00:07:29,651 --> 00:07:30,820
they don't,
they don't trust you.

186
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,260
Almost like,
it's either just like,

187
00:07:32,261 --> 00:07:33,960
I can't trust this one.
I'm like,

188
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,180
water's going to be like,
man,

189
00:07:37,181 --> 00:07:39,940
we were fucked up.
And then whoever did weird shit.

190
00:07:39,941 --> 00:07:41,650
It's like it's okay,
we're all hammered.

191
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,960
Right?
But if one person,

192
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:45,910
every person right and shit down

193
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,800
the atrial,
all my friends are getting married and

194
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,660
like the first thing they say,
when I say I don't drink,

195
00:07:50,661 --> 00:07:52,280
it's like you're not going to drink at
my wedding.

196
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,070
And I'm like,
well yeah,

197
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,960
is that okay?
Like,

198
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,560
can I still come and like,
they feel like you're ruining their

199
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,740
wedding because you're not going to
drink it.

200
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:03,410
It's like a very strange thing,
the culture of drinking as a nondrinker

201
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,870
you really realize how bizarre it is
socially.

202
00:08:05,871 --> 00:08:07,160
Take off.
How long has it been?

203
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:10,700
I stopped drinking last November,
so it hasn't been like super long,

204
00:08:10,701 --> 00:08:14,990
but long enough for people to really
have some weird feelings about it and

205
00:08:14,991 --> 00:08:16,790
just some shit.
I'm just sober man.

206
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:17,380
I Dunno.

207
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,900
It's not a bad thing.
I took a month off.

208
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,850
I took a.
We did sober October.

209
00:08:21,851 --> 00:08:23,530
No Pot,
no booze,

210
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,110
and then we had to do 15.
Yeah,

211
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:30,340
15 hot yoga classes,
90 minute hot yoga classes in a month.

212
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:33,150
It was this a bad between me and my four
friends was.

213
00:08:33,151 --> 00:08:35,410
It was a stupid bet because it wasn't
even a stakes.

214
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,960
Right.
Like if one of us didn't do it,

215
00:08:37,961 --> 00:08:41,050
we had to throw a party but we all did
it so it was pointless but.

216
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,170
But we learned a lot.
You learn a lot about just,

217
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:49,530
you learn a lot about that even if you
don't think you use alcohol or pot as an

218
00:08:50,201 --> 00:08:51,600
escape,
you do,

219
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,400
you lean on it a little bit?
Yeah,

220
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:56,430
and I always talk like people were like,
what are the differences

221
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,110
you've noticed and there've been so many
differences,

222
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:02,130
but I think like the number one thing is
just like the amount of confidence that

223
00:09:02,131 --> 00:09:02,861
I have.
Like I,

224
00:09:02,861 --> 00:09:06,510
I have this theory now that alcohol
gives you anxiety.

225
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:09,180
Like I used to be stressed out.
Like I realized that I was self

226
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:10,470
diagnosing myself.
I'd be like,

227
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,670
Eh,
I'm on a morning person.

228
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,520
I was probably just like perpetually
hung over and never like now,

229
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,710
like I,
I jumped up now in the morning I have so

230
00:09:16,711 --> 00:09:18,600
much energy,
so I'm like wow,

231
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:21,690
I wonder how many things I've been like
self-diagnosing.

232
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:22,620
I'm like,
Oh yeah,

233
00:09:22,621 --> 00:09:24,910
my skin just got bad.
Once I turned 26,

234
00:09:24,911 --> 00:09:26,970
like skinny immediately clears up.
So I'm like,

235
00:09:26,971 --> 00:09:27,900
wow,
maybe I,

236
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:32,700
I just had so much alcohol in my system
that I like developed random things like

237
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:35,490
it just kind of making excuses.
It's definitely not good for you.

238
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,780
It's certainly not good for you.
Five,

239
00:09:36,781 --> 00:09:37,910
six nights a week?
No.

240
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,430
And the best way to like stop drinking
is to read an article that freaks you

241
00:09:41,431 --> 00:09:43,800
out about like what drinking does,
like this is what I do because it's like

242
00:09:43,801 --> 00:09:47,280
how I trained myself to do things.
I'll look read some really extreme thing

243
00:09:47,281 --> 00:09:48,690
on the internet and then be like,
okay,

244
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,320
like
no,

245
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,600
like this guy had this theory that like
alcohol and people call alcoholic

246
00:09:58,021 --> 00:10:00,660
spirits or whatever that like when you
drink,

247
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:03,650
like it allows like evil spirits to come
into your body.

248
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:06,450
Like the most bizarre thing.
And I was just like,

249
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,010
yeah,
I can't drink anymore.

250
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,530
Got To keep away from evil spirits.
And that's what you used?

251
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:11,423
Yeah,
yeah.

252
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,520
I just like read weird articles and then
I'm like,

253
00:10:13,521 --> 00:10:14,610
I'm not gonna drink anymore.
I'm done.

254
00:10:14,611 --> 00:10:16,440
I'm over it.
And then I realized like who else

255
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:16,920
doesn't drink?

256
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,010
Like the most successful,
like Donald Trump has never drank

257
00:10:20,011 --> 00:10:21,570
alcohol,
which is just fascinating because I'm

258
00:10:21,571 --> 00:10:22,404
like,
I don't know,

259
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,550
he's got so much energy,
right?

260
00:10:26,551 --> 00:10:29,430
Like he's just like going at it.
And I'm like,

261
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:32,250
maybe that's the secret.
Charlie Kirk doesn't drink.

262
00:10:32,251 --> 00:10:34,890
He's like 24 years old.
And taking over the world.

263
00:10:34,891 --> 00:10:36,130
So I don't know.
Um,

264
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:39,030
who else?
Don trump junior doesn't drink.

265
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,800
Doesn't.
I mean he did like,

266
00:10:40,801 --> 00:10:43,020
I used to drink.
I don't mean to but he doesn't drink.

267
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,060
Um,
yeah.

268
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,190
I don't know.
I guess the people that I'm around now

269
00:10:47,191 --> 00:10:51,300
don't drink so it makes it easier,
but they're just like highly productive

270
00:10:51,301 --> 00:10:53,850
individuals and I'm now like highly
productive.

271
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,830
Kim Kardashian doesn't drink and whether
you like to

272
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,410
be highly productive,
but it's also good to have fun.

273
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,290
And I don't think there's anything wrong
with the little.

274
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,830
No,
I think there's nothing wrong with that.

275
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,660
People can drink around me all the time.
I don't care.

276
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,170
Oh actually I will say like when people
get like completely sloshed,

277
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,390
it's a weird thing to observe when
you're sober.

278
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:15,540
It's a strange place.
It's like being on another planet where

279
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:20,090
like everyone's acting like a toddler.
It's like watching a preschool class and

280
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,080
going to the bathroom like,
you know,

281
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,570
I'm like,
why are you screaming close to my face

282
00:11:24,571 --> 00:11:26,490
and talk to you and explain and they
want to get wrong.

283
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:30,060
Really close,
like drinking makes you a really close

284
00:11:30,061 --> 00:11:32,250
talker.
There's something where you need to feel

285
00:11:32,251 --> 00:11:35,810
like the heat emanating off of someone's
space.

286
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,520
You know,
people grabbed people do weird shit.

287
00:11:40,521 --> 00:11:42,560
To him.
It's a weird thing to watch sober.

288
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:44,820
There's a certain number of drinks where
it's fun and then there's a certain

289
00:11:44,821 --> 00:11:46,410
number of drinks were like,
wow,

290
00:11:46,411 --> 00:11:48,210
human beings are weird.
You know,

291
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:49,980
you're going to go back.
I mean,

292
00:11:49,981 --> 00:11:51,930
look,
I'm sure I'm not going to like never

293
00:11:51,931 --> 00:11:53,920
drink again,
but like I'm not even,

294
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,770
I don't even think about it.
Like it's just like this is the new

295
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,500
candice I'm sure like when I get
married,

296
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,110
right?
Like I'm not going to not have like

297
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:03,070
gossip champagne,
but like right now,

298
00:12:03,071 --> 00:12:04,540
like especially with like the stuff that
I'm doing,

299
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:07,480
I'm like I just don't have the energy to
be like tired.

300
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,280
Right.
Which is kind of a weird

301
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,320
sentence.
How did you become this?

302
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,760
You're a very popular,
what I would call conservative thinker,

303
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:19,000
but you're very young.
Like how did this all happen?

304
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,370
How did you become this Fox News
personality?

305
00:12:21,371 --> 00:12:22,420
Conservative thinker?

306
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,670
Yeah.
I mean I just launched a youtube channel

307
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,760
and fucking Youtube Youtube where magic,
but you teach a strange place.

308
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,470
Strange,
strange place.

309
00:12:33,471 --> 00:12:36,710
Yeah.
The Internet and the Internet of things

310
00:12:36,711 --> 00:12:38,750
happen on the Internet.
But yeah,

311
00:12:38,751 --> 00:12:41,150
I just kind of,
I was really passionate.

312
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,760
Um,
I understood I had studied for like,

313
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,520
it sounds strange,
but like I spent a year underground,

314
00:12:46,521 --> 00:12:50,030
like studying politics once I had my red
pill moment,

315
00:12:50,031 --> 00:12:52,980
if that's what you want to explain that
because you used to be a liberal,

316
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,010
right?
And then you became a conservative.

317
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,780
That's correct.
So what was it?

318
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:01,350
So the story really starts with like
high school I guess,

319
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,310
like you know,
how things can happen you in life and

320
00:13:03,311 --> 00:13:05,480
they don't make sense when they happen.
You're like why God me?

321
00:13:05,481 --> 00:13:07,010
And then when you get a little older and
you're like,

322
00:13:07,011 --> 00:13:08,460
this makes perfect sense.
Right?

323
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:13,630
So I was the quote unquote victim of a
hate crime when I was in high school.

324
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:17,870
When you say quote unquote victims
victim know I hate the word victim and

325
00:13:17,871 --> 00:13:19,850
it's,
I'm like an again early.

326
00:13:19,851 --> 00:13:23,270
I can see why early on I've sort of
developed this mentality that like being

327
00:13:23,271 --> 00:13:24,680
a,
there's no value in being a victim and

328
00:13:24,681 --> 00:13:27,130
people rush to call people a victim.
They rushed to call somebody the

329
00:13:27,131 --> 00:13:28,820
aggressor.
So how do you describe it that you

330
00:13:28,821 --> 00:13:31,610
experienced a hate crime against
something that was labeled as a hate

331
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:33,050
crime?
I W I wouldn't even call it a hate

332
00:13:33,051 --> 00:13:34,760
crime.
I think we live in a label obsessed

333
00:13:34,761 --> 00:13:37,430
culture and before we seek to understand
what happened,

334
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,870
we seek to like put it in a box like so
what?

335
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,240
Someone has to be a demon and someone
has to be an angel.

336
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:46,370
Right?
So what happened was I received some

337
00:13:46,371 --> 00:13:49,820
voice mail messages from about four kids
and then like,

338
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:51,110
you know,
the language was,

339
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,160
it was pretty strong.

340
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,260
It was like run a tar and feather your
family.

341
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,880
Um,
we're going to put a bowl in the back of

342
00:13:55,881 --> 00:13:57,440
your head that we did the Martin Luther
King.

343
00:13:57,441 --> 00:13:58,040
Like,
you know,

344
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,230
Edward,
Edward Edward.

345
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,600
And you received these on your phone?
On my cell phone?

346
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,130
Yeah.
How'd they get your phone number?

347
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,690
Well,
there was a prank phone call,

348
00:14:05,691 --> 00:14:07,940
so I didn't know.
I was like four male voices and I was

349
00:14:07,941 --> 00:14:09,500
like in high school at the time and I
was like,

350
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:11,630
okay,
I cannot think of for human beings that

351
00:14:11,631 --> 00:14:13,250
want me dead,
that would say like been up,

352
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,340
put a bullet in the back of your head
like we did to Martin Luther King and

353
00:14:16,341 --> 00:14:17,870
Rosa Parks.
Like naming a school.

354
00:14:17,871 --> 00:14:19,250
Where were you?
What part of the country?

355
00:14:19,251 --> 00:14:22,040
Stanford High School in Connecticut.
That's a shithole.

356
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,600
Yeah.
Yeah,

357
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,150
it's a total shit hole.
Connecticut Connecticut's on a Shithole.

358
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,840
It's a running joke.
I'm sorry.

359
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:31,870
I have my buddy Tommy Junior.
He lives in Connecticut and I'm always

360
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:32,411
telling him,
dude,

361
00:14:32,411 --> 00:14:35,380
you got to move out of Connecticut.
And it became this terrible running joke

362
00:14:35,381 --> 00:14:37,060
where I talk about the Connecticut's the
worst.

363
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:40,450
Have you actually been a bunch of times?
I used to work there all the time.

364
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:44,950
Well,
I used to work in all over Connecticut.

365
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:47,740
When I was doing standup,
I would drive from Boston into

366
00:14:47,741 --> 00:14:51,340
Connecticut.
I did like a lot of gigs in Hartford.

367
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,270
I did gigs

368
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:54,350
and shit.
It's a shit hole.

369
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:57,380
Bridgeport is a shithole.
Shout out tomorrow and starling junior

370
00:14:57,381 --> 00:15:01,280
though
he was a boxer that came out of

371
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,140
Hartford,
big time boxer,

372
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,150
Marlin,
Marlin starling.

373
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:10,690
But when you were in high school,
somebody started doing this prank call

374
00:15:13,801 --> 00:15:16,240
and shit on you and was,
this is all in one night.

375
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,480
It was all in one that was like four
voices tied to like a boyfriend or a

376
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,990
friend's house when I got the calls and
I just like put aside like it was a

377
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,020
blocked number.
So I was like,

378
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:29,570
I think anything of it.
And then like what I listened to it like

379
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,390
it was like some pretty horrific stuff.
Like I definitely cried,

380
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:34,160
you know,
I was 17 years old.

381
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:36,560
Um,
and then the next day at school I took

382
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:39,470
this philosophy class and like,
I don't know what the topic was.

383
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:43,430
I don't know what prompted me to raise
my hand and like introduce what happened

384
00:15:43,431 --> 00:15:45,260
last night as like,
you know,

385
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,270
a segway,
maybe I just needed to get off my chest.

386
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,580
But like the teacher like spazzed out
and was like,

387
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:51,500
get up,
we're going to the principal's office,

388
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:52,521
like,
you know,

389
00:15:52,521 --> 00:15:55,220
you have to report this.
He brings me into the office,

390
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:57,320
the principal like,
freaked out.

391
00:15:57,321 --> 00:15:58,970
Like she just like the language was
like,

392
00:15:58,971 --> 00:16:00,230
you know,
it was shocking,

393
00:16:00,231 --> 00:16:01,320
you know.
Um,

394
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:06,050
and then she called like the resource
officer and then like the next period of

395
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:09,440
my life was like a blackout because it
turned out that three of the kids I had

396
00:16:09,441 --> 00:16:12,170
never even met.
Like this was like maybe some kids that

397
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:15,290
had their first beer,
one of the kids I was like friends with,

398
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:18,860
but we were arguing because he was upset
that I was spending so much time with my

399
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,380
boyfriend,
but I didn't know he's gay.

400
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:22,250
Like he wasn't,
like,

401
00:16:22,251 --> 00:16:23,150
he just was like Jelly,
like,

402
00:16:23,151 --> 00:16:23,391
you know,
like,

403
00:16:23,391 --> 00:16:25,190
just like I,
you saying album every day started

404
00:16:25,191 --> 00:16:26,870
hanging off my boyfriend was a stupid
thing.

405
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,490
He wasn't 100 percent.
Yeah,

406
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:33,080
no I 100 percent from what I'm told.
But um,

407
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,401
yeah.
So,

408
00:16:34,401 --> 00:16:36,260
uh,
then petty.

409
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,530
And then it was like,
here are my three friends and they were

410
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:43,220
all going to get drunk and call these,
call this black girl and you know,

411
00:16:43,221 --> 00:16:45,800
it's easy to say awful things until like
this,

412
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:48,090
if you don't have to look at a human
being like,

413
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:51,050
it's easy to say awful things.
But unfortunately for me,

414
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,770
one of the people in the car happened to
be the current governor of Connecticut

415
00:16:54,771 --> 00:16:55,930
Sun.
Oh.

416
00:16:56,150 --> 00:17:00,440
So this turned from like some kids prank
called to like said some awful things to

417
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:04,370
like front page of the newspaper
throughout the entire state of

418
00:17:04,371 --> 00:17:08,120
Connecticut,
a little bit in New York Naacp outside

419
00:17:08,121 --> 00:17:09,340
of my school.
I have to.

420
00:17:09,341 --> 00:17:12,110
It was like this situation that was
talking about outrage culture.

421
00:17:12,111 --> 00:17:15,860
My first like introduction to outrage
culture and the things that sort of

422
00:17:15,861 --> 00:17:19,310
formed my thoughts like this was a very
formative experience in my life.

423
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,060
Um,
which to me it wasn't,

424
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,590
it was nonpolitical.
But it was like my life wasn't mine.

425
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,690
Like I went from like sitting down
watching.

426
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:30,500
I was watching Talladega nights with my
boyfriend to being the most discussed

427
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:34,220
person in the state of Connecticut.
And what was interesting about it was

428
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:36,350
just that,
because it was the governor of

429
00:17:36,351 --> 00:17:39,620
Connecticut sign that was in this car,
they had to get the FBI involved to

430
00:17:39,621 --> 00:17:44,240
determine the authenticity of the,
like maybe she called herself instead of

431
00:17:44,241 --> 00:17:45,890
just saying like,
yes it was my son,

432
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:48,940
he actually left the FBI,
investigated for six weeks and waited

433
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,450
and to get arrested six weeks.
Like,

434
00:17:50,451 --> 00:17:53,330
you know what I mean,
like his son denying this one,

435
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:54,900
see if they can get away with it.
But this is politics,

436
00:17:54,901 --> 00:17:55,441
you know what I mean?
Like,

437
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:58,410
can we get away with it?
Is it plausible for us to get away with

438
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:58,740
it?

439
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,530
You know,
so six weeks of the entire state.

440
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,910
I didn't,
I left school.

441
00:18:02,911 --> 00:18:04,950
People were like fighting on my behalf.
Fighting.

442
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:09,140
Yeah,
it was,

443
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:10,830
it was just like,
yeah,

444
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,780
yeah.
This was just like,

445
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:17,790
it was like a monstrosity of a situation
and it was one of those things where

446
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,590
like literally like letters to the
editor and be like,

447
00:18:19,591 --> 00:18:20,520
mom's like,
talk about,

448
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:21,510
you know,
outrage culture,

449
00:18:21,511 --> 00:18:23,520
right.
I don't believe candice,

450
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,930
this happened,
this girl,

451
00:18:24,931 --> 00:18:27,900
I believe she called herself like,
like I'm just looking for attention one

452
00:18:27,901 --> 00:18:31,050
night and I just decided to say I was
going to hang by family from a tree.

453
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,830
Isn't it funny that someone would even
have an opinion on that?

454
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,833
It's,
it's bizarre.

455
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,800
Writes letters to the editor.
Like I.

456
00:18:37,801 --> 00:18:39,780
The whole thing is weird
retrospectively,

457
00:18:39,781 --> 00:18:40,051
right?
Like,

458
00:18:40,051 --> 00:18:42,750
I don't believe her,
but that is what life is about,

459
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,090
right?
You have to go to youtube.

460
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:47,970
I still don't believe.

461
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,910
Exactly.
So it was the situation that was just

462
00:18:53,911 --> 00:18:57,580
completely out of my control.
And then as quick as it had,

463
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:59,250
these kids got arrested and then as
quick as it happened,

464
00:18:59,251 --> 00:19:00,520
it was over,
um,

465
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:03,030
for like everyone but not for me.
Are these kids,

466
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:03,923
right?
Like,

467
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,060
so I never wanted these kids to get
arrested.

468
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:09,330
Like if no one look at this whole
situation was taken out of my hands.

469
00:19:09,331 --> 00:19:10,680
People thought I didn't go to the
police.

470
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:13,110
Like my teacher went to the police.
It turned into the zoo.

471
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,660
These kids were labeled publicly
racists,

472
00:19:15,661 --> 00:19:17,190
right?
The youngest kid in the car,

473
00:19:17,191 --> 00:19:19,860
it was 14.
I'm not comfortable with every labeling,

474
00:19:19,861 --> 00:19:21,150
a 14 year old racist,
right,

475
00:19:21,151 --> 00:19:24,810
or any of these kids racist.
These are kids and in my opinion,

476
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:28,650
adults that failed to act like adults
and adults that fail to take a step back

477
00:19:28,651 --> 00:19:29,520
and say,
okay,

478
00:19:29,521 --> 00:19:31,800
why would,
what would prompt these kids do this?

479
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,750
Why is it so easy to be mean?
Right.

480
00:19:33,751 --> 00:19:36,810
Why is it so easy nowadays for children
to be mean?

481
00:19:36,811 --> 00:19:39,210
And no one to me,
like when I really thought about that,

482
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,200
I went through like five years of like
anorexia because of the situation

483
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,540
and I was the victim.
Yeah.

484
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,990
And Yeah,
you went through Lexia,

485
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:52,320
which is so weird now because like
people that know me now,

486
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:53,730
like there's no way you never didn't
eat.

487
00:19:53,731 --> 00:19:57,090
But I did.
I did like did not eat for like five

488
00:19:57,091 --> 00:20:00,370
years.
I had issues with Anorexia because I

489
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,820
actually has a disease that genuinely is
about control.

490
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,710
It's about a certain control of your
life.

491
00:20:04,711 --> 00:20:07,720
And I felt that I had my,
like my life was fine and then like

492
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,350
people took the narrative,
um,

493
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:12,180
and I could decide to determine what the
narrative was.

494
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,110
You're in,
you're,

495
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,950
you're a victim or maybe you're a liar,
you know,

496
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:18,480
these kids are racists,
these kids are this,

497
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,750
and just nobody really thought that,
like you actually ruined all of our

498
00:20:21,751 --> 00:20:22,080
lives.

499
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,000
Right?
Like for a little bit like these kids

500
00:20:24,001 --> 00:20:28,680
went on to have duis and get arrested
and got into drugs and it was because it

501
00:20:28,681 --> 00:20:31,830
was outraged of everything that happened
and I was like,

502
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:33,870
would have been totally cool with an
apology.

503
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:35,400
Like,
you know what I mean?

504
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,200
Like,
sorry.

505
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:41,190
Good for you for looking at it that way.
That's hard to do because everybody

506
00:20:41,191 --> 00:20:44,100
loves when they are allowed to get
outraged.

507
00:20:44,101 --> 00:20:45,240
Everybody loves,
get outraged.

508
00:20:45,241 --> 00:20:48,610
Obviously what they did do was horrible,
but I think a lot of kids,

509
00:20:48,611 --> 00:20:51,520
especially if they're drinking,
they don't even understand how stupid

510
00:20:51,521 --> 00:20:54,550
and gross it is what they do and they
just know they can do it and they get a

511
00:20:54,551 --> 00:20:57,490
thrill out of it.
And then there's that mob mentality when

512
00:20:57,491 --> 00:20:59,650
there's like a bunch of people together
doing the same thing,

513
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:02,000
wrap it up and start saying crazy shit.

514
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,810
Understandable.
When you think about it as a human being

515
00:21:04,811 --> 00:21:07,210
and not as somebody who to ab opinion,
like ear,

516
00:21:07,211 --> 00:21:07,661
like,
hey,

517
00:21:07,661 --> 00:21:08,950
we're going to call this black girl,
right?

518
00:21:08,951 --> 00:21:12,310
You've got a bunch of kids were going to
say mean things to her on the phone and

519
00:21:12,311 --> 00:21:14,450
you don't have to look her in the face.
Right.

520
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:18,880
It's like if I hold up this pen and
unlike just say mean stuff like

521
00:21:18,881 --> 00:21:21,250
someone's going to get,
you could say anything to this pen.

522
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,490
So it's,
it's sort of um,

523
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:26,350
it,
it was a formative experience that in

524
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:29,700
retrospect I understand has so much to
do with why I am who I am because I

525
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:32,320
hated that,
that label obsessed culture and the

526
00:21:32,321 --> 00:21:33,820
outrage machine and then like,
oh,

527
00:21:33,821 --> 00:21:34,480
okay,
we're done.

528
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,290
But like,
you know,

529
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:37,120
forget the people that,
whose lives we just like.

530
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:39,640
No.
Do you know those people anymore?

531
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:40,330
I don't.
I,

532
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:43,300
I know like the siblings of them because
I was friends.

533
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:44,800
Like that's the thing,
like one of the people that was

534
00:21:44,801 --> 00:21:46,660
involved,
I was very good friends with his brother

535
00:21:46,661 --> 00:21:48,290
and it's like,
you're just going to tell me this kid,

536
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,650
like a racist.
Like I actually knew the kid's mother,

537
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,360
you know,
like nobody cared.

538
00:21:52,361 --> 00:21:55,600
It was just hot story necessarily
racist.

539
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,450
They were just stupid,
stupid,

540
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:01,750
did something stupid and they do that.
That was a way that they could scare

541
00:22:01,751 --> 00:22:02,190
you.
Right.

542
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,530
That they could and they might fit,
you know,

543
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,460
like drunk.
Maybe it was their first beer.

544
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:10,390
Right.
But people can do well.

545
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:13,900
The youngest was 14,
the youngest and this person was labeled

546
00:22:13,901 --> 00:22:15,910
a racist.
Like that's to me is like,

547
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,490
that's harsh on people say,
Oh,

548
00:22:18,491 --> 00:22:20,920
you're too forgiving,
but not labeled them a racist because

549
00:22:20,921 --> 00:22:22,870
what they said was most certainly
racist.

550
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,520
Yes.
The words are racist.

551
00:22:24,521 --> 00:22:25,290
Right?
Can somebody,

552
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:27,790
the.
I guess the question is can somebody say

553
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:30,580
something,
say a word that is racist and not be a

554
00:22:30,581 --> 00:22:31,990
racist human being?
Yes.

555
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:33,940
I think now I'm going to tell you why.
Yes.

556
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,650
Okay.
If somebody stand up,

557
00:22:35,651 --> 00:22:37,450
I was watching,
I actually don't remember who it was.

558
00:22:37,451 --> 00:22:39,580
Like maybe it was Louis Ck,
I don't know,

559
00:22:39,581 --> 00:22:44,200
but he was saying how he like instantly
turns into a racist,

560
00:22:44,201 --> 00:22:46,420
like if somebody cuts him off and it's
like a Chinese person,

561
00:22:46,421 --> 00:22:48,100
like,
like instantly the first thing he has

562
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,620
something to do with him being Chinese.
Right.

563
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,990
And there's a little bit of that in all
of us.

564
00:22:52,991 --> 00:22:57,430
Like I was walking through New York City
the other day and I'm like a huge bus

565
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:02,590
just happen to like stop in front of me.
And like literally 45 agents got up and

566
00:23:02,591 --> 00:23:04,530
suddenly I was just like,
I couldn't walk around.

567
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,321
I'm like,
oh,

568
00:23:05,321 --> 00:23:07,360
I was like,
why do Asians always travel in packs?

569
00:23:07,361 --> 00:23:08,830
Right?
Like the most bizarre thing,

570
00:23:08,831 --> 00:23:11,740
like I don't have an issue with them or
taking a bus and traveling.

571
00:23:11,741 --> 00:23:13,480
And then afterwards I giggled.
I was like,

572
00:23:13,481 --> 00:23:14,620
what a stupid thing.
Oh,

573
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:18,670
stupid thoughts even had to have because
I'm frustrated in the moment that I

574
00:23:18,671 --> 00:23:20,620
can't like get my bearings in New York
City.

575
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,390
Um,
so yes,

576
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:26,230
I think that people in a moment of
frustration of anger,

577
00:23:26,231 --> 00:23:28,210
if you add alcohol,
if you add Ambien,

578
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:29,530
right?
Um,

579
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:32,090
and are,
are coming from a place of upset and

580
00:23:32,091 --> 00:23:37,060
they can just do something that's stupid
without holding this like whole word for

581
00:23:37,061 --> 00:23:40,000
the rest of their,
your 14 year racist and forever you are

582
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:41,060
raised.
That's march.

583
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,800
Yeah.
So especially today.

584
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,070
Today,
nobody wants

585
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,030
anybody to recover from anything.
That's right.

586
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:49,460
They want to know that you're,
you're dead.

587
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:52,160
It's over.
Your career is done.

588
00:23:52,161 --> 00:23:56,000
Your life is over.
You said the wrong thing.

589
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:59,060
Done the wrong thing.
I mean obviously there's some reasons

590
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,760
for some people to be like Harvey
Weinstein's.

591
00:24:01,761 --> 00:24:03,710
Perfect example of that guy should be in
jail.

592
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:06,610
Of course,
for sure this is a rapist.

593
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:07,710
Yeah.
This is great.

594
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:10,310
Police alleged rapist.
What for sure.

595
00:24:10,311 --> 00:24:12,710
He's done a lot of horrible shit.
Correct.

596
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:15,980
But then there's people that like,
like,

597
00:24:15,981 --> 00:24:19,060
what did Samantha Bee say today?
She called up Ivanka con.

598
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,650
Exactly.
What happens there.

599
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,430
Thinks he gets in trouble.
I bet she doesn't.

600
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:26,330
She's not going to get into,
but she doesn't because she left wing.

601
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:29,330
She's left wing overmanned space to say
sorry.

602
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:32,780
I'm assuming some of this shit that
Keith Olbermann job at espn.

603
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:33,980
It's,
they don't care.

604
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:38,570
There are fucking so many tweets that he
put out that are crazy called trump a

605
00:24:38,571 --> 00:24:42,440
Nazi and fuck you and think about what
people say

606
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:45,300
about like Ben Carson and black
conservatives.

607
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,970
We get.
Ben Carson was literally called a porch

608
00:24:47,971 --> 00:24:50,250
monkey.
Eat it and that's totally fine.

609
00:24:50,251 --> 00:24:51,270
He's black.
It doesn't matter.

610
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,133
They like,

611
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:54,770
who created this system?
Who is it that did it though?

612
00:24:54,771 --> 00:24:56,960
It wasn't like a famous person,
a famous person.

613
00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:00,410
Absolutely called monkey black person.
Black Person.

614
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:05,650
That's like if I call a Guy Guinea but
it's porch monkey is not.

615
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,940
I don't care who it's coming from,
right?

616
00:25:07,941 --> 00:25:08,421
Like,
yeah,

617
00:25:08,421 --> 00:25:11,940
but black people are allowed to say
racist shit to other black people.

618
00:25:11,941 --> 00:25:13,460
Which racist.
It's not.

619
00:25:13,461 --> 00:25:15,780
Okay.
None of it's okay if the uncle toms and

620
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:20,000
we go weird stuff that we have laws or
rules culturally and I don't like those

621
00:25:20,001 --> 00:25:21,410
laws and rules,
so I pushed back.

622
00:25:21,411 --> 00:25:22,244
I hear you.
Yeah,

623
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,550
I agree.
It's definitely hypocritical.

624
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:28,880
Like someone was saying that there was a
tweet that I retweeted today,

625
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:33,350
that smallville girl,
that smallville show is still on the air

626
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,910
and that girl is apparently she,
she's admitted to sex trafficking and

627
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:42,440
that some of it was her idea.
I read the smallville still on the air

628
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:45,160
and they're pulling Roseanne from Hulu.
Right?

629
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:48,020
Roseanne swear she did not know that
lady was black.

630
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:49,790
She swears she.
I mean she doesn't,

631
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:53,570
she doesn't look,
if you don't allison mack's as branding

632
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,780
the sex slaves was her idea branding
them.

633
00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:00,440
Allison.
That's means like burning a logo into

634
00:26:00,441 --> 00:26:01,820
their bodies.
Right.

635
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,940
What is wrong with that?
I don't know enough about that story.

636
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:08,300
Put that bitch must be off the charts,
which is crazy.

637
00:26:08,301 --> 00:26:09,134
Yeah,

638
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,710
but it's,
it's only accepted.

639
00:26:10,711 --> 00:26:15,480
Like if you have any ties whatsoever to
conservative thought like if you have

640
00:26:15,481 --> 00:26:17,940
even liked,
liked a tweet that trump sent out,

641
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,860
like forget about it,
forget about it.

642
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,450
Like I'm not even conservative,
but I have conservative people or talk

643
00:26:23,451 --> 00:26:26,700
to and people call me all right and all
this crazy shit.

644
00:26:26,701 --> 00:26:29,110
They're just looking to silence and
labor.

645
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:31,840
Right.
They're obsessed with labels and I hate

646
00:26:31,841 --> 00:26:33,280
that.
I hate the idea that you can't say

647
00:26:33,281 --> 00:26:37,150
something like they were literally,
I mean everyone piled in every celebrity

648
00:26:37,151 --> 00:26:39,520
on the sun piled in.
When I tweeted a couple of weeks ago

649
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,160
that I was having a conversation,
I don't know if you saw this,

650
00:26:42,161 --> 00:26:43,860
I was like,
I was having a at lunch

651
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,620
because I've just been observing Chelsea
handler.

652
00:26:46,621 --> 00:26:49,530
I just think she's weird person.
Like I don't know what happened because

653
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,570
I used to really like her.
Like you know,

654
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:54,230
10 years ago when you were liberal.
Yeah,

655
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,590
I.
But like when she was,

656
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:58,080
had her show,
like she was not politically correct.

657
00:26:58,081 --> 00:27:00,120
I mean I don't know if anybody remembers
the show Chelsea lately,

658
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,050
but she was making fun of everybody and
now with the era of trump,

659
00:27:04,051 --> 00:27:05,790
she's like,
something's weird.

660
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:09,750
She's getting older and I think she
wants to be an activist now and I think

661
00:27:09,751 --> 00:27:12,720
she's looking for more meaning and
importance because she doesn't have a

662
00:27:12,721 --> 00:27:15,550
family or children and I tweaked that.
Oh,

663
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,270
you tweeted this,
tweet it.

664
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,720
But it's true.
I'm like,

665
00:27:20,721 --> 00:27:22,710
I'm like,
I'm talking to like a friend at lunch.

666
00:27:22,711 --> 00:27:27,420
I was and we were talking about like,
why some of these like older woman I

667
00:27:27,421 --> 00:27:30,300
have just gone bonkers and you know,
my friend made a comment.

668
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,280
She's like,
if you don't like use your eggs,

669
00:27:32,281 --> 00:27:33,410
they scramble.
Like just saying

670
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:36,930
that.
My friend said,

671
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,030
well I didn't even tweet that.
I didn't tweet that.

672
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,830
You're French.
Put that shit on TV show.

673
00:27:40,831 --> 00:27:42,730
It's really funny if we don't use your
eggs scrambled.

674
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:45,270
So I was like cracking up.
I know it's a but there's something

675
00:27:45,271 --> 00:27:46,970
there.
There's something there.

676
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:50,340
It's not politically correct,
but I observed the pattern of Kathy

677
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,530
Griffin.
I observe the pattern of Chelsea handler

678
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,860
and Sarah Silverman on the fence.
Not as bad but in that neighborhood.

679
00:27:55,861 --> 00:27:57,450
So I tweet out,
do you think there's something

680
00:27:57,451 --> 00:28:00,330
associated like between like woman who
don't have children and they need

681
00:28:00,331 --> 00:28:04,320
something to nurture and foster and try
to raise and in this sense it's society.

682
00:28:04,321 --> 00:28:07,170
Like they are just trying to parent the
hell out of society.

683
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:10,650
And I think Sarah does.
Sarah goes back and forth.

684
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,040
She's like,
she's like,

685
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:15,300
she's a kind person,
but there's something like once in a

686
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,021
wash,
I'm just like,

687
00:28:16,021 --> 00:28:18,270
what?
Like I did actually go back when I said,

688
00:28:18,271 --> 00:28:19,104
you know what,
Sarah,

689
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:22,500
I shouldn't put you in the same category
as Kathy and Chelsea,

690
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:25,390
but it's like this.
They're like obsessed with like

691
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:29,910
everything and they're completely wrong
and educated about everything and yet

692
00:28:29,911 --> 00:28:31,590
they think they can say whatever they
want.

693
00:28:31,591 --> 00:28:33,940
So I tweet this and I mean everyone was
like,

694
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,090
you'd like to believe that you like l,
like Ellen.

695
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,280
I'm the ellen shows producers.
Like,

696
00:28:38,281 --> 00:28:40,290
I mean jake tapper,
like delete the tweet.

697
00:28:40,291 --> 00:28:42,810
I was like,
I'm not deleting jake.

698
00:28:42,811 --> 00:28:45,710
Jake tapper jumps,
chunked up or delete the three now.

699
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,110
He said,
he said like,

700
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,840
this is literally,
so I tweet,

701
00:28:48,841 --> 00:28:50,370
this has nothing to do with trump.
Anybody.

702
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:54,300
He's like,
this is the girl who supports trump and

703
00:28:54,301 --> 00:28:56,580
works for turning point USA,
which loves trump.

704
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:58,160
I'm like,
what were the weirdest,

705
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:00,400
like logical jump ever.
So yeah.

706
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,440
And I just like,
I'm like,

707
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:02,280
Jake,
Jake,

708
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,410
stop yourself.
Like,

709
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,400
come on.
So in the end everyone was just like,

710
00:29:05,401 --> 00:29:06,570
delete the two.
And I was just like,

711
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:08,580
how about,
what was the actual wording of the

712
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:10,950
tweet?
I think my exact words were at lunch

713
00:29:10,951 --> 00:29:15,951
with a friend talking about like how
bizarre Chelsea Handler Kathy Griffin

714
00:29:16,351 --> 00:29:17,610
and Sarah Silverman.
So Sarah something.

715
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:20,670
I just tweeted something like pro
[inaudible] and it was like the whole

716
00:29:20,671 --> 00:29:22,020
Israel.
It was bizarre,

717
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:24,130
you know,
and how crazy they've gotten.

718
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,060
And then I just said like,
do you think that something really

719
00:29:27,061 --> 00:29:29,190
happened?
Swimming if they don't have children.

720
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,740
And that was,
it's just a question question.

721
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:35,920
Such a hot spots or you're going after a
soft spot on.

722
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:38,470
Yeah,
that's it.

723
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,930
Right?
And I'm like,

724
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:42,310
Sarah Huckabee,
sanders

725
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,270
going to lose her job.
Right?

726
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,890
She can say anything.
We want to say anything that's Sarah.

727
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,980
There's anything to anybody to me,
right?

728
00:29:50,981 --> 00:29:52,330
Anybody that supports trump,
it doesn't matter.

729
00:29:52,331 --> 00:29:55,360
But then like these women who literally
go after these people,

730
00:29:55,361 --> 00:30:00,310
like the amount of vitriol that Chelsea
handler has thrown to Ivanka to every

731
00:30:00,311 --> 00:30:02,440
single woman in the world.
Chrissy teagan's also like a net.

732
00:30:02,441 --> 00:30:03,790
Like she just like angry,
like,

733
00:30:03,791 --> 00:30:04,900
you know,
just like hate,

734
00:30:04,901 --> 00:30:05,734
hate,
hate.

735
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:08,220
And then like you say,
one thing about them and like they were

736
00:30:08,221 --> 00:30:10,240
like,
how could you even question,

737
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:13,930
how could you even ask a question if
it's because they don't have kids?

738
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:16,190
And I'm like,
the fact that you guys are so outraged

739
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,070
makes me sort of think that,
you know,

740
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,170
yeah,
a little bit.

741
00:30:20,171 --> 00:30:22,840
And I didn't delete the tweet.
If you didn't have any point at all,

742
00:30:22,841 --> 00:30:25,030
it wouldn't work in that way.

743
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:28,330
Just like a stupid
person.

744
00:30:28,331 --> 00:30:29,440
She doesn't know what the fuck she's
talking.

745
00:30:29,441 --> 00:30:30,520
And I tweeted that.
I was like,

746
00:30:30,521 --> 00:30:33,010
there's gotta be something here because
you guys are all losing your minds.

747
00:30:33,011 --> 00:30:35,500
You know,
it's so Sarah Silverman responded.

748
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:37,150
Kathy Griffin was like,
they went nuts.

749
00:30:37,151 --> 00:30:39,980
This was like a full on,
like Kathy Griffin is so happy someone's

750
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:43,480
talking about her,
but she's busy and they'd gotten

751
00:30:43,481 --> 00:30:46,840
bizarre.
And at one point these people to me were

752
00:30:46,841 --> 00:30:49,090
funny and something sort of just
happened.

753
00:30:49,091 --> 00:30:53,200
And like trump is the means like they,
whatever they're going through in life,

754
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,950
the outlet is trump.
And anybody that likes trump will people

755
00:30:56,951 --> 00:30:58,440
think there's a cultural war going on
there.

756
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:03,100
Most certainly is areas for sure,
so they feel like they're on a side and

757
00:31:03,101 --> 00:31:03,934
they have to,
you know,

758
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:07,570
they're going to lob grenades during the
war and it gives people,

759
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:10,900
it also gives people a sense of purpose
like that engaging in these twitter

760
00:31:10,901 --> 00:31:14,980
fights somehow or another is like
reinforcing good behavior and shutting

761
00:31:14,981 --> 00:31:18,610
down the bad behavior and don't
necessarily believe that I,

762
00:31:18,611 --> 00:31:20,950
even if I don't agree with someone
online,

763
00:31:20,951 --> 00:31:23,320
I very rarely tweet about them.

764
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,170
I'm not,
I just,

765
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:29,110
I feel like I try at this stage in my
life to avoid conflict as much as

766
00:31:29,111 --> 00:31:31,960
possible unless it comes to writing
jokes.

767
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,960
Sometimes.
Some people gotta get you gotta take the

768
00:31:34,961 --> 00:31:35,950
hit.
I know.

769
00:31:35,951 --> 00:31:37,900
And usually when I go after someone
like,

770
00:31:37,901 --> 00:31:39,670
I mean I'm not at that phase in my life
where it's all peace.

771
00:31:39,671 --> 00:31:42,040
Like I'm definitely a person that'll
just say something,

772
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:45,550
but usually it's just in like,
that's what I thought,

773
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:47,320
you know,
it's not as thoughtful like,

774
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:49,030
and people were like back down or you
can't,

775
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:52,870
like this morning or yesterday,
like Ben Shapiro and I got into a little

776
00:31:52,871 --> 00:31:57,871
spat and we actually like each other.
But like I genuinely annoyed by his

777
00:31:57,881 --> 00:31:59,770
behavior online,
like it's genuinely,

778
00:31:59,771 --> 00:32:00,990
yeah,
I just find them to be like,

779
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:02,263
like,
and by.

780
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:03,670
I like him.
Like that's the thing that's bizarre.

781
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:06,280
It's like I think people think there's
much more like hate between us and there

782
00:32:06,281 --> 00:32:06,941
is,
it's like not,

783
00:32:06,941 --> 00:32:08,800
it's just like genuinely like I read a
sweet sound like dude,

784
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,420
shut up when I say,
what did he say?

785
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:13,990
Just little petty things that he throws
that trump's sometime that are so

786
00:32:13,991 --> 00:32:14,824
unnecessary.

787
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,530
It's not even trump.
It's like he,

788
00:32:18,531 --> 00:32:21,190
like Kim Kardashian goes to,
you know,

789
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:24,340
get Alice Marie Johnson.
She's been fighting for this for years.

790
00:32:24,341 --> 00:32:28,530
She put all of her money into a legal
team to do this and that's not the only

791
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,430
case she's been working on,
like actually trying to help these

792
00:32:30,431 --> 00:32:33,460
people get clemency and she takes a
picture and he's like,

793
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,130
he says something just very Ben Shapiro.
He was like,

794
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:38,380
we should not be worshiping.
Slept like that.

795
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:40,070
Hopefully he's worshiping as we're
taking a meeting

796
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,540
with convention,
not worshiping a celebrity.

797
00:32:41,541 --> 00:32:44,090
These are,
that's a little extreme of an analysis

798
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:46,600
for a meeting.
And the picture is taken,

799
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:46,900
like,
you know,

800
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,200
I've visited the president,
there is a full time photographer and

801
00:32:49,201 --> 00:32:51,460
every person that to the president,
you've got a picture of the,

802
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:53,540
in the Oval Office.
It's like a part of the system.

803
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:55,580
Um,
and yeah,

804
00:32:55,581 --> 00:32:56,570
so I was just like,
dude,

805
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:57,620
shut up.
Like,

806
00:32:57,621 --> 00:32:58,760
you know,
like I didn't say shut up.

807
00:32:58,761 --> 00:32:59,594
I said like,

808
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:04,930
she's got a good point in a way we
really shouldn't be worshiping celebrity

809
00:33:04,931 --> 00:33:08,750
for the sake of celebrity.
And especially reality show celebrity.

810
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,270
I mean,
it doesn't mean that she couldn't have a

811
00:33:10,271 --> 00:33:12,910
very valid point about prison reform.
Yeah,

812
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,310
that's what I'm saying.
That's what I'm saying.

813
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:16,110
She wasn't he,
I think he said something like,

814
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,630
we shouldn't allow celebrities to shape
policy.

815
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:22,440
She wouldn't go there shape policy.
She literally had a case that she's been

816
00:33:22,441 --> 00:33:23,221
trying to get.
Pardon me?

817
00:33:23,221 --> 00:33:26,370
The only person that can do that happens
to be President Donald Trump.

818
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:27,870
It's actually,
you know,

819
00:33:27,871 --> 00:33:29,660
what she's trying to do is actually very
honored.

820
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:31,040
That's what I said.
I said,

821
00:33:31,041 --> 00:33:31,880
listen,
she.

822
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,940
And she's been working on it for you.
Like,

823
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:36,140
she's actually into this now.
Like she's into this prison reform and

824
00:33:36,141 --> 00:33:38,480
I'm passionate about it.
Like I grew up seeing my uncle's in

825
00:33:38,481 --> 00:33:39,770
prison.
So like for me,

826
00:33:39,771 --> 00:33:42,350
the only time that I like snap back at
anyone is if it's something that I care

827
00:33:42,351 --> 00:33:43,021
about.
Obviously.

828
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,390
Like I'm,
I really am passionate about black

829
00:33:44,391 --> 00:33:46,160
America.
I'm really passionate about the changes

830
00:33:46,161 --> 00:33:48,950
that can happen for black America and
prison reform or something I'm really

831
00:33:48,951 --> 00:33:51,890
passionate about.
So I've been observing like how hard

832
00:33:51,891 --> 00:33:53,300
yard at and working on this.
I hardly,

833
00:33:53,301 --> 00:33:56,660
Blanca has been working on this and have
really understood what they're trying to

834
00:33:56,661 --> 00:33:57,051
do.
Like,

835
00:33:57,051 --> 00:33:59,420
you know,
I went to the prison reform summit a

836
00:33:59,421 --> 00:34:02,450
couple like a month ago and,
and Kim in this,

837
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,790
she doesn't even like agree with trump
on a lot of stuff.

838
00:34:04,791 --> 00:34:08,480
She's thrown some shade at him,
but this is something is Alison Marie

839
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,980
Johnson case she was doing before trump
got into office.

840
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,650
What I love about the picture of her and
him,

841
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,450
she's like,
where the fuck over here?

842
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,170
I was taking a picture with Donald.
I'd be hugging.

843
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,160
I'd be like,
ha ha.

844
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,060
But she,
she cares about the case.

845
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:24,220
But look how far away she is from them.
Look at it.

846
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:28,130
I will say two of them

847
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:32,010
I will say is awkward though because his
desk is a lot lower than you than you

848
00:34:32,011 --> 00:34:34,200
realize.
That's actually a little closer to like

849
00:34:34,201 --> 00:34:37,540
stand up straight like she's standing or
like Ben,

850
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,160
I bent when I was in there,
which is also kind of weird too.

851
00:34:41,161 --> 00:34:43,950
So it's like you see people who either
like this or they're like this and

852
00:34:43,951 --> 00:34:44,740
there's no in between.

853
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:47,820
We could do like 19 fifties,
moviestar picture like this.

854
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,010
What do you mean exactly?
I should.

855
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:53,520
That's what I should've done.
But she's closer than I thought she was.

856
00:34:53,521 --> 00:34:56,130
I felt like maybe I put it in my own
head.

857
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,100
It's actually pretty.
God damn good right there.

858
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,880
She's gorgeous,
but it doesn't look anything like she

859
00:34:59,881 --> 00:35:01,090
used to look.
But yeah,

860
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,360
whoever did that,
nobody does.

861
00:35:03,361 --> 00:35:06,810
Nowadays Mr. Surgeon,
you did some awesome work.

862
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,840
She's plump.
It looks good.

863
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:11,940
But I guess the question is kind of
celebrity.

864
00:35:11,941 --> 00:35:13,350
Do a good act,
you know,

865
00:35:13,351 --> 00:35:14,184
and.
Sure.

866
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,060
Of course the answer is yes.
I mean that's,

867
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,910
that's what Chelsea handler's trying to
do.

868
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:19,380
I mean,
that's like she's donating,

869
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:23,130
but she really is.
She donated a million dollars to Puerto

870
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:23,360
Rico.
Oh,

871
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,540
right.
Which is good.

872
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,380
Yeah,
that's good.

873
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,510
That should be celebrated.
That's what she's trying to do with all

874
00:35:27,511 --> 00:35:29,580
of her money now.
She doesn't even give a fuck about like,

875
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,580
which is,
which is good.

876
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:31,630
Good.

877
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,460
All of that stuff.
Like when they do stuff like that,

878
00:35:33,461 --> 00:35:35,980
it's great and it's honorable,
but like the stuff that I hate that

879
00:35:35,981 --> 00:35:38,070
celebrities do and what I wish I
differentiate

880
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:40,890
from,
and I guess this confuses people is when

881
00:35:40,891 --> 00:35:43,710
they just give their opinion like we,
you know,

882
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,920
at like the emmys and they're onstage
just like teaching all of us about how

883
00:35:46,921 --> 00:35:49,620
wrong our opinions are.
It's like I don't need the celebrity

884
00:35:49,621 --> 00:35:51,340
grandstanding.
Like you know,

885
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:54,000
if there's an issue you care about other
than the fact that people disagree with

886
00:35:54,001 --> 00:35:55,320
you,
then sure do.

887
00:35:55,321 --> 00:35:56,820
That.
If you care about like Ashton Kutcher

888
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,680
going after sex trafficking,
celebrate that.

889
00:35:58,681 --> 00:36:01,940
That's cool.
Like Kim Kardashian going over after a

890
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:03,300
crime justice reform.
Celebrate that.

891
00:36:03,301 --> 00:36:05,700
That's cool.
But when you get these celebrities that

892
00:36:05,701 --> 00:36:07,770
just get up there and try to deliver a
tier two,

893
00:36:07,771 --> 00:36:10,740
it's like shut up.
Literally nobody cares what you think

894
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,410
like this.
Well the care enough that that person's

895
00:36:13,411 --> 00:36:17,160
got that platform and they feel like
this is their opportunity to say

896
00:36:17,161 --> 00:36:19,600
something significant.
I'm looking at this girl also like

897
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:23,160
thinking they're for sure 100 percent
virtue signaling,

898
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,000
letting everybody know how moral and
ethical they are.

899
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:31,350
Even if they are,
I mean this is just those fucking award

900
00:36:31,351 --> 00:36:33,180
shows or weird as shit.
They're weird.

901
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:35,640
It's weird.
You should go up there and you should

902
00:36:35,641 --> 00:36:39,910
say thank you God.
Thank you.

903
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:41,560
Thank you to the man upstairs.
Thank you.

904
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:45,540
Owed and you for number of the days when
they used to do that.

905
00:36:45,541 --> 00:36:47,070
Yeah.
They used to say a couple of names of

906
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:49,830
producers come up with a little piece of
paper and then they used to always think

907
00:36:49,831 --> 00:36:51,810
the man upstairs and they used to go
down.

908
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,330
Now they have like,
like the face and the emotion,

909
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,640
you know,
started off.

910
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,870
Started this.
Marlin motherfucking Brando.

911
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,930
Really?
In between having sex with everyone.

912
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:03,630
Marlon Brando apparently fucked Richard
Pryor.

913
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:07,230
Who knows what the fuck.
He's fucked a bunch of different people.

914
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:07,771
I've,
I've,

915
00:37:07,771 --> 00:37:11,280
I brought you.
This guy was one Marvin Gaye.

916
00:37:11,281 --> 00:37:13,560
Am I making that up completely?
I think one was like,

917
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,130
it was sad.

918
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:15,090
It was Marvin Gaye,
but it's,

919
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:18,240
you know,
it's Pryor's wife admitted it,

920
00:37:18,241 --> 00:37:20,020
which to me is a huge prior fans.
Uh,

921
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:24,510
there was a spike through the heart.
Quincy said he would fuck anything in

922
00:37:24,511 --> 00:37:25,350
quotes.
Yeah,

923
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,180
I bet it would be fucked.
Richard Pryor.

924
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,070
I mean,
what the hell?

925
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:31,150
He's still.
He started this.

926
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:36,380
So he started this because when he won
the academy award for I wanna say it was

927
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:40,950
apocalypse now.
He had a native American guy go on stage

928
00:37:40,951 --> 00:37:43,860
and take it to this place to highlight
the plight of native Americans.

929
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,410
Maybe it was a different movie,
but it was,

930
00:37:46,411 --> 00:37:50,460
it became as big political.
Marlon Brando was crazy for the

931
00:37:50,461 --> 00:37:51,870
godfather.
The Godfather.

932
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:55,620
Thank you.
So we had this guy go up and accept the

933
00:37:55,621 --> 00:37:58,440
award in his place and give some speech
is woman.

934
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,533
Oh,
okay.

935
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:02,070
So then just became like a culture of
like trying to one up each other.

936
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:05,010
So that was going on really was him.
I just know that that was a miracle.

937
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,450
It's unbearable.
You know,

938
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:09,180
it's just a little odd.
I can't stand it.

939
00:38:09,181 --> 00:38:11,550
It drives me insane.
But that's a huge difference.

940
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,250
That doesn't mean that I think that
celebrities can't do good in the world.

941
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:19,251
It's just that like the celebrity
grandstanding can use volume on this job

942
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,390
bearable.
Roger Moret looking all good.

943
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,730
Oh,
so this won't hold on.

944
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:23,603
Go back to

945
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,230
modern Glendo the godfather.
And so now

946
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:38,500
my name's a little feather.
Holy Shit.

947
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:41,280
I look at,
look at them.

948
00:38:41,281 --> 00:38:42,990
They're like,
we can't say shit.

949
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,440
Even back then nobody knew what to do.
Like a

950
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:51,730
little feather.
I'm the president of the national native

951
00:38:51,991 --> 00:38:54,560
American affirmative image committee.
She's hot as fuck.

952
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:59,630
She's really pretty
and he has asked me to tell you in a

953
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:03,030
very long speech,
which I cannot share with you presently

954
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:07,080
because of time,
but I will be glad to share with the

955
00:39:07,081 --> 00:39:12,081
press afterwards.
CanNot accept this very generous award

956
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:20,630
and the reasons for this being are the
treatment of American Indians today by

957
00:39:21,781 --> 00:39:25,140
the film industry.
Excuse me,

958
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:39,370
and on television and movie reruns,
and also with recent happenings at

959
00:39:40,671 --> 00:39:44,450
wounded knee.
I beg at this time that I have not

960
00:39:44,451 --> 00:39:49,451
intruded upon this evening and that we
will in the future our hearts and our

961
00:39:52,041 --> 00:39:54,410
understandings will meet with love.

962
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,600
Pause for a second.
Isn't that what was going on?

963
00:39:57,601 --> 00:39:59,530
Just a second.
This isn't it?

964
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:03,200
The same place where a couple years ago.
Well,

965
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,530
no,
that wasn't wounded knee.

966
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:06,000
What was that?
Standing rock

967
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:11,850
standing rock.
Know that this is heavy head.

968
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,800
Wow.
This is where it all began.

969
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:17,700
It's where I've
been trying to one up each other.

970
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,820
Maybe I might've made that up.
Like she like one.

971
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,990
She came in around the perfect time.
Yes.

972
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:28,310
NBC wrote,
this is our president tweeted it.

973
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,930
It's insane.
It's like the not even pretending,

974
00:40:30,931 --> 00:40:33,030
which I appreciate now.
They're not pretending to be the news

975
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:34,920
anymore.
Like they're just like,

976
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:39,990
we hate trump and we are the propaganda
machine that will tell you like twitter.

977
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,570
It was just the NBC twitter,
it said something like,

978
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,990
I was just like,
wow,

979
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:48,130
wow.
And then everyone was out.

980
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,040
There was like the opposite of outrage
culture,

981
00:40:50,041 --> 00:40:50,820
which I don't even know what it is.

982
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:51,421
It's like run,
run,

983
00:40:51,421 --> 00:40:53,760
run.
You have to run because like speech

984
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:59,360
secret and Dr Oz.
It's just like I can't take anything

985
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:03,270
seriously anymore.
So there's things to be taken seriously.

986
00:41:03,271 --> 00:41:06,740
But celebrities probably on that list.
It's hard bureaus,

987
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:07,810
right?
Yeah.

988
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:09,240
Dot,
well he's right about this.

989
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:13,080
But he was trying to correlate like what
Kim did like with Alisha Marie Johnson

990
00:41:13,081 --> 00:41:14,070
with like that.
And I'm like,

991
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:15,480
come on man.
That's like totally different.

992
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:17,430
And just in general,
like sometimes she just gets a little

993
00:41:17,431 --> 00:41:19,140
like hall monitor for me.
Like you know,

994
00:41:19,141 --> 00:41:20,200
like it's just like,
you know,

995
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:23,880
you can't help themselves.
Was very snarky.

996
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:25,350
I liked him a lot.
I like him too.

997
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,120
That's the thing.
It's like people we actually really get

998
00:41:27,121 --> 00:41:29,000
along,
but like the hall monitor,

999
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:31,650
I know these types of school,
like I was in their classes,

1000
00:41:31,651 --> 00:41:33,050
you know,
like they're just like,

1001
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:34,100
like late

1002
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,010
to school or the last person you want to
see is like a hall monitor.

1003
00:41:37,011 --> 00:41:40,910
Like you know,
like the idea that she would be late

1004
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:44,720
writing you a pink slip.
It's like Ben just gave me the pink

1005
00:41:44,721 --> 00:41:46,620
slip.
Do that.

1006
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:47,510
Just give it to me,
Ben.

1007
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,620
All right.
Like right.

1008
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:51,330
This is a gateway to Saturday school.
Like it's just like,

1009
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:56,900
it's so bad
he saying sometimes.

1010
00:41:56,901 --> 00:41:57,820
Yeah,
I do that.

1011
00:41:57,821 --> 00:41:59,450
A lot of you do that.
How do you do that?

1012
00:41:59,451 --> 00:42:01,010
Can't do that.
And he's doing it sober.

1013
00:42:01,011 --> 00:42:03,710
He's not like some dudes who do that.
They're all adderall dot.

1014
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,013
Yeah,
he does that.

1015
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,840
But I liked that.
I liked these kids in school.

1016
00:42:08,841 --> 00:42:09,621
I'd just be like,
you know,

1017
00:42:09,621 --> 00:42:12,590
I was just the kid that was just like
Kinda like more chill and like I don't

1018
00:42:12,591 --> 00:42:15,200
need to like and sometimes new just
schools over stupid stuff.

1019
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,050
It's like.
But I do wonder like if he's learning

1020
00:42:18,051 --> 00:42:19,370
anymore,
that's the one thing,

1021
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,300
like I like,
yeah,

1022
00:42:20,301 --> 00:42:23,330
because he doesn't like to have like
it's like once he has an opinion,

1023
00:42:23,331 --> 00:42:26,900
like I liked to be,
like to have conversations and I like to

1024
00:42:26,901 --> 00:42:29,030
be wrong and about the conversation
because I don't know everything.

1025
00:42:29,031 --> 00:42:32,240
I think that's kind of like white people
love this podcast so much because you're

1026
00:42:32,241 --> 00:42:34,460
open to learning anything.
Like it will have people on this

1027
00:42:34,461 --> 00:42:35,270
podcast.
You're like,

1028
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:36,290
what was he having,
you know?

1029
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:39,320
Because there's some,
there's always something that you can

1030
00:42:39,321 --> 00:42:40,790
learn.
There's always something that you don't

1031
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:43,790
understand that you don't know if you
have an open mind.

1032
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:46,780
Right.
And I think that in in many ways and

1033
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:50,540
that like sometimes he's just not open
to learning about certain things and

1034
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:55,580
somebody might know something about a
culture beyond what he knows and it's

1035
00:42:55,581 --> 00:42:56,250
just like,
nope,

1036
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:58,050
that's the idea,
right?

1037
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:03,250
Like it's just drives me crazy,
but I like is really fucking smart.

1038
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:05,270
And that's the problem.
That's the problem.

1039
00:43:05,271 --> 00:43:08,060
Exactly stupid.
He thinks everyone is stupid.

1040
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:10,120
Know,
like I hate it.

1041
00:43:10,121 --> 00:43:14,160
Like I got so annoyed with like the
Kanye West for second to the greatest

1042
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:16,340
article saying Kanye West is just crazy.
I'm like,

1043
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:18,710
yeah,
and I wrote him an email.

1044
00:43:18,711 --> 00:43:19,550
I was just like,
dude,

1045
00:43:19,551 --> 00:43:22,460
like I understand that to you and the
way that you've done your life.

1046
00:43:22,461 --> 00:43:23,690
This doesn't make sense.
Right?

1047
00:43:23,691 --> 00:43:28,130
But this is actually really important
for black people to see that he was the

1048
00:43:28,131 --> 00:43:31,050
most important thing.
Which thing was it him like,

1049
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:32,240
you know,
him tweeting out.

1050
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:34,880
I love the way cancer was saying,
but beyond that saying that he openly

1051
00:43:34,881 --> 00:43:38,330
supported the president so I can see why
ben chips something like that down

1052
00:43:38,331 --> 00:43:42,170
initially because to him like culture is
not the way you talk about politics.

1053
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,760
Right?
Like because he's by the book,

1054
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,030
but he has to understand that by the
book is not the way people in the hood

1055
00:43:47,031 --> 00:43:49,370
or being raised by the book.
It's not the way people in the projects

1056
00:43:49,371 --> 00:43:51,320
are being raised.
These people have had their families

1057
00:43:51,321 --> 00:43:53,960
destroyed and decimated by,
by the welfare system.

1058
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:55,790
Right.
The fathers aren't even at the homes,

1059
00:43:55,791 --> 00:43:57,470
you know,
the single motherhood rate jumped seven

1060
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,710
from 25 percent in 1965 to 74 percent
today,

1061
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:04,880
and so these kids turn to culture to
father them.

1062
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:08,600
They turned to Jay z and beyonce and hip
hop and Kanye and to tell them what's

1063
00:44:08,601 --> 00:44:11,270
right and what's wrong.
So for so long because the left has had

1064
00:44:11,271 --> 00:44:14,000
a stranglehold on culture,
they've had a strangle hold on black

1065
00:44:14,001 --> 00:44:16,460
America.
So the most significant thing that

1066
00:44:16,461 --> 00:44:20,750
opened up this dialogue beyond the work
that I was doing was this simple tweet

1067
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,240
and the simple show of support from
Kanye West.

1068
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:28,370
And I was so frustrated that he had,
he had to like in that moment just like

1069
00:44:28,371 --> 00:44:29,990
dismiss them as crazy.
It's just like dude,

1070
00:44:29,991 --> 00:44:31,800
like just be willing to learn,
like,

1071
00:44:31,801 --> 00:44:32,970
you know,
just be willing to say like,

1072
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:36,950
I don't understand why the hell this is
the way that this is why people want to

1073
00:44:36,951 --> 00:44:38,160
talk about politics.
Right?

1074
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:42,030
But maybe there's something here.
And I always understood that culture was

1075
00:44:42,031 --> 00:44:44,820
the most important vertical.
When Charlie and I first met and we sat

1076
00:44:44,821 --> 00:44:46,100
down,
I defined three very minimal.

1077
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:48,460
Charlie is Charlie,
Charlie,

1078
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:53,760
Charlie Kirk is like this 18 year old.
We started turning point USA who I work

1079
00:44:53,761 --> 00:44:56,610
for when he was 18 and he is like a
savant.

1080
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,160
They call him like trump's boy wonder,
like,

1081
00:44:59,161 --> 00:45:02,230
he's a brilliant.
If you want to talk about like smart and

1082
00:45:02,231 --> 00:45:03,630
beyond,
like the smartest person I know is

1083
00:45:03,631 --> 00:45:05,850
Charlie Kirk,
hands down and he's only 24.

1084
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:06,841
Um,
he didn't,

1085
00:45:06,841 --> 00:45:08,160
he didn't go to college,
just like,

1086
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:10,230
I don't know,
just like just reading weird stuff when

1087
00:45:10,231 --> 00:45:11,140
he was seven.
I don't know,

1088
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:12,240
like,
just like things that everyone's like,

1089
00:45:12,241 --> 00:45:13,520
oh yeah,
I just read that Thomas Soul.

1090
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:13,861
He's like,
yes,

1091
00:45:13,861 --> 00:45:15,080
I read it when I was six,
you know,

1092
00:45:15,290 --> 00:45:17,100
what am I trying?
Did you not say that?

1093
00:45:17,101 --> 00:45:18,540
Could you be cool?
But.

1094
00:45:18,541 --> 00:45:19,374
So,
um,

1095
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,330
when,
when Charlie and I met and I,

1096
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:24,630
like I told him like my plan to sort of
help black America and wake them up

1097
00:45:24,631 --> 00:45:27,510
because I understood how we had fallen
victim to this brainwash.

1098
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:30,690
There was brainwashed,
the leftist dogma.

1099
00:45:30,691 --> 00:45:32,490
There's this idea that because we're
black,

1100
00:45:32,491 --> 00:45:35,460
we have to vote Democrat anyway.
That is not a Democrat is racist and

1101
00:45:35,461 --> 00:45:38,040
against helping us.
That is like what so many black

1102
00:45:38,041 --> 00:45:39,270
Americans believe.
I believed it.

1103
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:40,920
I believed it.
You know what I mean?

1104
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:41,381
So,
and I'm a,

1105
00:45:41,381 --> 00:45:42,540
I'm a pretty smart girl,
you know,

1106
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:44,160
I've always been a very smart girl.
I've always,

1107
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:45,120
I've always been,
you know,

1108
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:48,120
I've excelled in,
in academics,

1109
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:50,370
right?
So how did I fall victim to it?

1110
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,690
The exact same system,
right?

1111
00:45:51,691 --> 00:45:53,430
These three verticals,
the first being the family,

1112
00:45:53,431 --> 00:45:56,430
that breakdown of the family.
The second one I'm being culture,

1113
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:58,770
which then to me like growing up it was
like Jay z,

1114
00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:01,610
like Jay z was God to me.
Like I would throw on like I was,

1115
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:02,850
you know,
I went through a lot of stuff when I was

1116
00:46:02,851 --> 00:46:04,140
a kid.
I didn't have a great family,

1117
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:05,310
um,
you know,

1118
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:07,500
um,
but I would throw on a Jay z album and

1119
00:46:07,501 --> 00:46:09,870
like whatever he said was like,
it was like going to church,

1120
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,700
you know?
And then,

1121
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:14,130
and I can't stand them now,
but the third vertical,

1122
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,120
no,
no,

1123
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:17,280
because he knows exactly what he's doing
and he's a trader,

1124
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:22,310
but the third vertical being education,
which was casual side trader,

1125
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:26,580
yeah,
it's like beyonce and Jay z because he

1126
00:46:26,581 --> 00:46:29,460
knows what's happening to black America
and he's somebody that built his entire

1127
00:46:29,461 --> 00:46:32,490
career off the backs of black America,
you know,

1128
00:46:32,491 --> 00:46:37,270
of being the guy who started in the
honing in in Queens and worked at,

1129
00:46:37,271 --> 00:46:38,760
you know,
as a drug dealer and worked his way up

1130
00:46:38,761 --> 00:46:40,920
and it became the ideal for so many
people in Black America.

1131
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:43,380
And then he stands on stage and endorses
Hillary Clinton.

1132
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:46,800
He stands on stage and tell us,
black America to put the same people in

1133
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:49,770
the White House that locked up more
black men than any present history of

1134
00:46:49,771 --> 00:46:50,730
United States.
Bill Clinton,

1135
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:52,770
right?
The person that stands on the crime bill

1136
00:46:52,771 --> 00:46:55,710
of 94 is Bill Clinton.
But because Jay Z is now focused on

1137
00:46:55,711 --> 00:46:57,780
getting a piece of the pie,
the globalist piece of the Pie,

1138
00:46:57,781 --> 00:46:59,590
he doesn't care about black America.
Um,

1139
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:00,780
that's,
that's my opinion.

1140
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,260
Um,
so what,

1141
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:06,000
what it was or do you think that maybe
he thought that Donald Trump represented

1142
00:47:06,001 --> 00:47:07,530
a lot of racist white people?
No.

1143
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:09,503
Oh God,
no.

1144
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:11,160
Not even.
Kind of,

1145
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,890
not,
not for a single second,

1146
00:47:13,891 --> 00:47:16,400
Jay,
because Jay z is very smart now.

1147
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,251
I didn't speak to him.
I just,

1148
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:20,370
I know like there's a certain thing
where like I just,

1149
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:22,590
I know that Jay z and beyonce betrayed
the black community.

1150
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:25,200
Like there they are.
I think they did it purposely for

1151
00:47:25,201 --> 00:47:26,220
financial gain.
Yeah,

1152
00:47:26,221 --> 00:47:26,971
I think,
yeah,

1153
00:47:26,971 --> 00:47:27,700
I think that they,
they,

1154
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:29,860
they were interested in having,
they want to be

1155
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,770
the people that control the world and
they felt that Hillary Clinton,

1156
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:34,330
you know,
they were working with Obama very

1157
00:47:34,331 --> 00:47:37,810
closely and very cluey.
Now we know that the Obama

1158
00:47:37,811 --> 00:47:40,690
administration worked very hard to get
Hillary Clinton to office and they

1159
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:45,100
wanted to stay in that group.
And so they supported Hillary Clinton

1160
00:47:45,101 --> 00:47:48,910
who was selected behind closed doors,
forget the American people to the next

1161
00:47:48,911 --> 00:47:52,300
president.
United States selected certainly by the

1162
00:47:52,301 --> 00:47:53,260
DNC.
Yeah,

1163
00:47:53,261 --> 00:47:54,940
no 100 percent.
But beyond that,

1164
00:47:54,941 --> 00:47:56,320
it was an embed with Obama,
you know,

1165
00:47:56,321 --> 00:47:59,440
she was our secretary of state and she,
she was doing deals behind closed doors

1166
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:01,750
and Jay Z and beyonce,
we're a part of that click,

1167
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:04,900
right?
So they were a part of the celebrated

1168
00:48:04,901 --> 00:48:08,350
celebrities that were allowed to go to
the White House and they'd wear the ties

1169
00:48:08,351 --> 00:48:12,670
and everybody will be taken photo.
But it was a cool thing to be friends

1170
00:48:12,671 --> 00:48:13,760
with Obama,
right?

1171
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:16,900
Nobody wants to go to the White House
and like celebrities.

1172
00:48:16,901 --> 00:48:18,640
It's hard to get celebrities to go with
trump.

1173
00:48:18,641 --> 00:48:21,400
There's so much controversy attached to
attach your career.

1174
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:25,600
Can you get attacked and attacked by
quarter left and right?

1175
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:28,870
Part of what's happening with Rosanna is
not just that you made a racist tweet,

1176
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:32,560
she didn't know it was racist.
She supports trump and then she,

1177
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:37,000
her character supports trump and people
were looking for something to hate her

1178
00:48:37,001 --> 00:48:39,220
over and she handed it to them.
You know,

1179
00:48:40,110 --> 00:48:40,943
you,
you,

1180
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:45,960
you stick your neck out in that way and
you're just people on the left for sure.

1181
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:49,390
Look at anyone who's a trump supporter
as an open target.

1182
00:48:49,391 --> 00:48:53,710
Even if they're a reasonable person,
even if they're a person who is kind and

1183
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:58,740
measured and very even keeled,
he's like the nicest person I've ever

1184
00:48:59,201 --> 00:49:00,760
met about the trump,
you know,

1185
00:49:00,761 --> 00:49:03,550
and she's like never responds,
never punches back.

1186
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:04,483
And,
and look what they,

1187
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:05,600
how they treat her.
Well,

1188
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:07,090
this house,
Samantha Bee did it.

1189
00:49:07,091 --> 00:49:09,280
But yeah,
other people have gone after all the

1190
00:49:09,281 --> 00:49:10,490
time.
They go after Ivanka.

1191
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:14,650
She's such a kind person,
but it's just because her father is

1192
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:18,100
Donald Trump.
So it's open season and that's why jake

1193
00:49:18,101 --> 00:49:21,430
tapper jumps into a tweet about Chelsea
handler and tries to correlate trump.

1194
00:49:21,431 --> 00:49:25,510
It's like they're obsessed with people
that I'm like,

1195
00:49:25,511 --> 00:49:26,380
trump.
I like trump.

1196
00:49:26,381 --> 00:49:27,610
I don't know what to say.
I liked the guy.

1197
00:49:27,611 --> 00:49:32,080
I think it's really funny to have jake
tapper on the news the day of the

1198
00:49:32,081 --> 00:49:33,760
election.
We did a comedy.

1199
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:36,270
We did a podcast from the comedy store.
Uh,

1200
00:49:36,271 --> 00:49:38,200
we,
we call it the end of the world podcast,

1201
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:41,350
have a bunch of people because whoever
the fuck when's the end of the world,

1202
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:45,220
this live podcast.
And uh,

1203
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:49,840
I went into the green room afterwards to
the comedians bar and jake tapper was on

1204
00:49:49,841 --> 00:49:54,841
TV and he was so bummed out and I took a
photo of him like him on the screen.

1205
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,670
You just see the sadness.
I remember his face.

1206
00:49:57,671 --> 00:50:00,700
He was really sad.
He was sad to find that,

1207
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:01,723
oh my God,
it's

1208
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:05,950
the best likes,
like a splice together,

1209
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:08,620
like all of the clips of just like it
was exceptional.

1210
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:10,760
The news anchors and the emotion that
was coming out of them.

1211
00:50:10,761 --> 00:50:14,860
And he did some crazy thing is all of
them that said he'll never win.

1212
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:19,060
You'll never win.
It's forever.

1213
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:20,320
They laughed,
they laughed.

1214
00:50:20,321 --> 00:50:21,820
I remember there's a moment where like
Ann Coulter,

1215
00:50:21,821 --> 00:50:23,080
they said,
so who do you have winning?

1216
00:50:23,081 --> 00:50:24,670
And she says,
Donald Trump.

1217
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:27,740
And they broke into laughter,
like the cool kids,

1218
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,940
the cool kids at the,
um,

1219
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:32,360
at the lunch table.
And that's really how they've been

1220
00:50:32,361 --> 00:50:36,290
acting like they're not interested.
They think that they're the cool kids at

1221
00:50:36,291 --> 00:50:40,280
the lunch table and they get to define
what's cool and they're just having a

1222
00:50:40,281 --> 00:50:42,050
rude awakening right now.
And it's beautiful to watch.

1223
00:50:42,051 --> 00:50:43,030
I love it,
I love it.

1224
00:50:43,031 --> 00:50:44,550
He loves an upset to.
Yeah,

1225
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:47,570
people love enough.
And then they also wants their team gets

1226
00:50:47,571 --> 00:50:49,280
in.
Then they want to support their team so

1227
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:51,260
they fucked up.
I'm making it tribal.

1228
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,250
Tribal right.
Versus left.

1229
00:50:55,251 --> 00:50:55,791
People go,
well,

1230
00:50:55,791 --> 00:50:57,650
fuck these guys.
Fuck Jake tapper.

1231
00:50:57,651 --> 00:51:00,080
I'm going on this side.
That's my team now.

1232
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:05,900
It's like team sports fanatics right
now.

1233
00:51:05,901 --> 00:51:08,540
It doesn't even matter.
There's little sense anymore.

1234
00:51:08,541 --> 00:51:11,120
It's just like this is the team that
I've plugged my life too.

1235
00:51:11,121 --> 00:51:14,600
And part of that is ego.
Like you just spent how many months

1236
00:51:14,601 --> 00:51:16,130
calling everybody racist,
sexist,

1237
00:51:16,131 --> 00:51:17,300
deplorable.
Are you really going to go,

1238
00:51:17,301 --> 00:51:17,781
man,
you know what?

1239
00:51:17,781 --> 00:51:19,610
I was wrong.
They have to hold on to something.

1240
00:51:19,770 --> 00:51:20,290
Right?
And,

1241
00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:24,800
and I see that because like when I went
to this prison reform summit,

1242
00:51:25,090 --> 00:51:28,580
I'm Van Jones was there and,
and Donald trump is speaking and it was

1243
00:51:28,581 --> 00:51:30,320
like love between them.
It was.

1244
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,290
But this is the guy that said White
Lash,

1245
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:33,950
you know,
right after the election.

1246
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:35,060
And He,
you know,

1247
00:51:35,061 --> 00:51:36,920
but how,
how can he go back from that?

1248
00:51:36,921 --> 00:51:38,590
It's very hard to,
you know,

1249
00:51:38,610 --> 00:51:41,630
peddle backwards from that.
So half of them are fake in my opinion.

1250
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:44,110
I find them to be fake because I've seen
them behind closed doors.

1251
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:46,700
They don't feel that animosity for the
president cause it's hard to.

1252
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:49,700
He's really likable.
I mean like his presence when you meet

1253
00:51:49,701 --> 00:51:51,290
him,
he's very aware of himself.

1254
00:51:51,291 --> 00:51:53,060
He's aware of the jokes that are being
made about him.

1255
00:51:53,061 --> 00:51:56,080
He'll make the jokes about himself and
yeah,

1256
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:57,440
he's,
he's likable,

1257
00:51:57,441 --> 00:51:59,840
he's got the.
He just has something about him when he

1258
00:51:59,841 --> 00:52:02,960
makes a tweet,
a memorial day saying that the dead

1259
00:52:02,961 --> 00:52:07,961
soldiers would be really happy to know
how the economy is doing and how black

1260
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:09,760
unemployment.
It's the slowest.

1261
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:12,230
Never been like,
that shit was ridiculous.

1262
00:52:12,231 --> 00:52:14,530
I actually missed that to you.
I'm just laughing as I.

1263
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:16,450
every time someone says a trunk to be,
I just like,

1264
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:19,340
I laugh.
I just think it's funny that he put the

1265
00:52:19,410 --> 00:52:22,580
me in memorial.
There was an article,

1266
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,840
I'm telling you,
I'm telling you we're in going in

1267
00:52:26,841 --> 00:52:27,350
different directions.

1268
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:29,990
Like I predict in 20 slash 20,
like he's not going to go on seat and

1269
00:52:29,991 --> 00:52:31,040
he's going to be like,
be here.

1270
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:33,830
Like it's like he just wants to talk and
it's really hard.

1271
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:37,700
It's really hard for these people to
speak because what happens is they go

1272
00:52:37,701 --> 00:52:39,680
onto a stage and the room,
they love him.

1273
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:41,750
They great.
Everyone loves him because he's really

1274
00:52:41,751 --> 00:52:43,280
likable.
You can't be in room with trump and not

1275
00:52:43,281 --> 00:52:46,910
laugh and like him.
But then they take out his fingers right

1276
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:51,920
now I know they take away the,
the clips and they spliced up and they

1277
00:52:52,401 --> 00:52:53,690
make it,
like he said something bad,

1278
00:52:53,691 --> 00:52:56,810
but what they're doing is it's a
terrible game to play because you're not

1279
00:52:56,811 --> 00:53:00,110
just lying on trump.
You're lying on the 50,000 people,

1280
00:53:00,111 --> 00:53:02,120
you know,
the thousands of people that are there

1281
00:53:02,121 --> 00:53:03,020
to hear him speak,
right?

1282
00:53:03,021 --> 00:53:06,200
Like so they're playing a game where
then those people get pissed off with

1283
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:07,670
me.
You think they're playing a game where

1284
00:53:07,671 --> 00:53:09,620
they're,
they're misinterpreting the things that

1285
00:53:09,621 --> 00:53:13,710
he's said plenty of shit.
The way they spliced it up.

1286
00:53:13,870 --> 00:53:15,060
Like for example,
when that,

1287
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:17,120
that,
that moment when he says,

1288
00:53:17,121 --> 00:53:18,320
Oh,
if this was the old days,

1289
00:53:18,321 --> 00:53:20,570
we take you,
we take you out to the back,

1290
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:21,290
like,
you know,

1291
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:24,170
do you remember that moment when he said
while he was running and somebody was,

1292
00:53:24,290 --> 00:53:26,010
you know,
causing a circus in the

1293
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:28,080
crowd and like he was like,
get him out of here.

1294
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,850
And then the way they ran it,
right?

1295
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:30,730
Like,
oh,

1296
00:53:30,730 --> 00:53:33,960
like when in the old days when they used
to like hang black people from trees.

1297
00:53:33,970 --> 00:53:35,530
Like what?
Why?

1298
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:38,400
I think he literally meant that you used
to be able to get your ass kicked.

1299
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:41,520
That's how they spin it.
And then same thing,

1300
00:53:41,570 --> 00:53:43,410
like when he said you,
what do you have to lose?

1301
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:45,120
Prior to that,
he had listed every stat.

1302
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:46,180
We're quietly,
you got tentative and you're like,

1303
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:46,860
oh,
you know what I mean,

1304
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:47,693
the loser,
you know?

1305
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,050
But then they get that clip in there
like,

1306
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:51,840
oh,
trump is insulting black America.

1307
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:53,800
He's saying that they all live in.
No,

1308
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,260
he's saying this.
Typically speaking,

1309
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,600
if you look at the people that live in
the projects are going to be letter in

1310
00:53:57,601 --> 00:53:59,370
poverty.
It is black America,

1311
00:53:59,371 --> 00:54:02,760
so he's asking the current,
the past administrations have not been

1312
00:54:02,761 --> 00:54:04,260
serving you.
What do you have to lose?

1313
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:07,740
So it frustrates me because it's like
you see that,

1314
00:54:07,970 --> 00:54:09,930
um,
that they mix it up and they try to

1315
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,330
divide the country,
but at the end of the day,

1316
00:54:12,331 --> 00:54:15,450
unfortunately for them,
he's actually really likable and same

1317
00:54:15,451 --> 00:54:16,920
for don trump,
junior like,

1318
00:54:16,921 --> 00:54:18,690
I mean they're,
they're really funny.

1319
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:20,580
They're really likable and they're aware
of themselves.

1320
00:54:20,581 --> 00:54:21,960
Like they're in on the joke guys like,

1321
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,790
well,
Jamie was telling me the other day that

1322
00:54:24,791 --> 00:54:27,900
they made some video.
What was the video that they made to see

1323
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:30,880
if you can find that video was really
funny with her all mocking themselves

1324
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,840
about that.
What was it about that Laurel and um,

1325
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,140
yeah,
yeah,

1326
00:54:36,141 --> 00:54:38,100
the two words.
I actually haven't even heard the words

1327
00:54:38,101 --> 00:54:39,330
that everyone was.
I haven't either.

1328
00:54:39,331 --> 00:54:40,081
I'm like,
fuck you.

1329
00:54:40,081 --> 00:54:41,640
I'm not paying attention to that stupid
shit.

1330
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:43,160
I will not listen to the board.
Yeah,

1331
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,930
just to woods in my life.
I don't care.

1332
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:48,120
I literally don't care.
I didn't even listen to the word,

1333
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,860
but yeah,
they made fun of themselves.

1334
00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:50,441
Yeah.
Let's see.

1335
00:54:50,441 --> 00:54:51,750
It will play it.
Kellyanne Conway.

1336
00:54:51,751 --> 00:54:52,150
Was it?

1337
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:53,480
Give it to us from the beginning.
John Young.

1338
00:54:53,481 --> 00:54:55,160
Jamie.
This is a different.

1339
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,610
It's a different one.
The news put it up so I've got to get

1340
00:54:58,611 --> 00:54:59,410
the real one.
They put.

1341
00:54:59,410 --> 00:55:00,350
Okay.
Okay.

1342
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:03,560
It's,
it's hilarious that they have.

1343
00:55:03,561 --> 00:55:06,800
I mean this is,
this is actually a very clever thing to

1344
00:55:06,801 --> 00:55:07,130
do

1345
00:55:07,130 --> 00:55:08,360
because they.
But they're all like that.

1346
00:55:08,361 --> 00:55:10,370
Like Ivanka,
like they're all aware of the joke,

1347
00:55:10,371 --> 00:55:11,350
like they're in on it

1348
00:55:11,410 --> 00:55:13,630
here for sure.
Do you have an ad blocker on?

1349
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:13,930
Yeah.

1350
00:55:13,930 --> 00:55:16,940
You clever bastard.
So clean.

1351
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:25,040
It's Laurel.
It's Laurel,

1352
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:30,210
but I could deflect and divert to Yanni
if you need me to do that.

1353
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:32,653
Definitely.

1354
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:34,993
I don't know.
It's

1355
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:37,700
sorry.
Laura.

1356
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:41,620
Sara,
it's been reported that you hear more or

1357
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:44,380
how do you respond?
Clearly you're getting your information

1358
00:55:44,381 --> 00:55:46,570
from CNN because that's fake news.
Uh,

1359
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:49,000
all I hear is yawning.
Oh Man.

1360
00:55:49,001 --> 00:55:51,130
That's Laurel.
Laurel.

1361
00:55:51,131 --> 00:55:51,964
To stop this.

1362
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:53,390
What is,
what is wrong here?

1363
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:55,760
Something going on today.
The things messing up.

1364
00:55:55,910 --> 00:55:58,810
What is messing up the tri caster?
Yeah.

1365
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:00,990
We to do that thing we were talking
about and fix up.

1366
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:04,940
Anyway.
It's just the idea is that these people

1367
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,380
had the sense of humor and then with the
trump at the end he's doing.

1368
00:56:10,090 --> 00:56:11,480
What is he saying?
Was He at

1369
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:13,920
a year?
Yeah.

1370
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:15,950
That's funny.
Yeah,

1371
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:18,720
and that's the thing is they're like,
like they were in on the joke and I

1372
00:56:18,721 --> 00:56:23,410
think that people don't realize like how
in on the joke they are like,

1373
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,160
they're like,

1374
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:27,550
he's aware that you say all this stuff
about the fact that he tweets out and

1375
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:28,440
says all of this stuff.
Right?

1376
00:56:28,441 --> 00:56:30,940
Like,
like don trump junior is aware that he's

1377
00:56:30,941 --> 00:56:32,800
a billionaire son and that's what people
say,

1378
00:56:32,801 --> 00:56:33,610
Oh,
you're a billionaire.

1379
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:37,480
So and like they're so funny and that
it's sad that people don't get to see

1380
00:56:37,481 --> 00:56:39,670
that side.
So I actually do hope that they all come

1381
00:56:39,671 --> 00:56:43,600
on the show because it's.
People should actually see how hilarious

1382
00:56:43,601 --> 00:56:45,730
they are and how aware of themselves
they're like the most to me,

1383
00:56:45,731 --> 00:56:47,650
in my opinion,
the most likable,

1384
00:56:47,651 --> 00:56:50,650
relatable first family of my lifetime.
Like,

1385
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,210
you know,
I can't speak to anyone but there.

1386
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:55,670
So you didn't think that Obama and
Michelle were likable.

1387
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:57,730
My God.
Oh my God.

1388
00:56:57,731 --> 00:56:59,770
Are you going to like Obama?
Like he was a likable guy.

1389
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:01,000
Just,
you know what's funny,

1390
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:06,001
I was at a dinner last night with people
that came over from Cuba and this woman

1391
00:57:06,761 --> 00:57:08,980
said that when she first heard Obama
speak and she was,

1392
00:57:08,981 --> 00:57:10,120
she was way older.

1393
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:13,610
She broke down crying because it
reminded her of the first time shared

1394
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:15,610
Fidel Castro street,
which is a bizarre thing to say,

1395
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:16,301
right?
I was just like,

1396
00:57:16,301 --> 00:57:17,111
well,
I don't know anything.

1397
00:57:17,111 --> 00:57:21,100
I've never been to Cuba.
And they got scared that America was

1398
00:57:21,101 --> 00:57:23,320
going to turn into a communist country.
It was with a bunch of Cubans.

1399
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:25,091
Yeah.
Crazy.

1400
00:57:25,091 --> 00:57:26,290
Right?
Like they literally came out of their

1401
00:57:26,291 --> 00:57:30,820
mouths but have ptsd but what they know,
but what they say could be.

1402
00:57:31,570 --> 00:57:34,270
It could be,
but what they were saying was like the

1403
00:57:34,271 --> 00:57:35,670
veneer of it all.
Like,

1404
00:57:35,671 --> 00:57:36,430
like,
you know the.

1405
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:38,530
It was like exactly what you wanted to
hear.

1406
00:57:38,710 --> 00:57:40,730
Obama said,
and the perfect and the perfect home.

1407
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:44,770
The perfect hand mannerism with,
um,

1408
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:45,880
with the,
I don't know,

1409
00:57:45,890 --> 00:57:49,540
the perfect inflection in his voice and
there's something about that to me,

1410
00:57:49,541 --> 00:57:50,980
like,
especially the person that I am,

1411
00:57:50,981 --> 00:57:53,140
that just was super inauthentic and not
saying,

1412
00:57:53,141 --> 00:57:54,460
by the way,
when Obama won in 2008,

1413
00:57:54,461 --> 00:57:55,600
I cried like the let's,
let's,

1414
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:56,980
let's let me not be fake here.

1415
00:57:57,010 --> 00:57:58,660
Like I was like,
like he's black,

1416
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:00,100
I'm black,
everything was going to be great,

1417
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:01,080
you know?
Um,

1418
00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:02,230
but,
uh,

1419
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,000
you know,
as things went on and I was watching

1420
00:58:04,001 --> 00:58:05,380
him,
it just,

1421
00:58:05,381 --> 00:58:08,080
everything seemed so fake and he wasn't
really doing anything.

1422
00:58:08,081 --> 00:58:11,530
So I just don't respond to that sort of
a personality.

1423
00:58:11,531 --> 00:58:14,860
I liked that authentic and I think
that's why trump coming in behind him,

1424
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,860
um,
was so relatable as a precedent.

1425
00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:19,810
Like there's this theory and it's a good
one.

1426
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:20,630
Bye.
Tumor,

1427
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:21,910
Koran,
that,

1428
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:25,480
why do you like revolution?
Revolutions take place unexpectedly.

1429
00:58:25,481 --> 00:58:28,180
You could argue that right now America
is having a revolution.

1430
00:58:28,181 --> 00:58:29,830
It's,
we're not out there shooting each other,

1431
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:32,860
but there's an ideological revolution,
a cultural war,

1432
00:58:32,861 --> 00:58:34,090
if you want to call it,
that's taken place.

1433
00:58:34,091 --> 00:58:35,770
And too many people just seems
unexpected,

1434
00:58:35,771 --> 00:58:37,300
right?
Obama was in office and then like,

1435
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:39,040
Whoa,
went to Donald Trump.

1436
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:41,410
You know,
and the theory is that when you're,

1437
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,690
when the public and the private of an
individual,

1438
00:58:43,691 --> 00:58:47,290
our personas get too far apart,
a natural evolution takes place.

1439
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:50,800
And Society really has just been so
fake.

1440
00:58:50,910 --> 00:58:51,341
It.
I mean,

1441
00:58:51,341 --> 00:58:54,010
like everything offends you.
Everywhere you go.

1442
00:58:54,011 --> 00:58:57,760
People get offended by people's hair.
Like literally Kardashians will put

1443
00:58:57,761 --> 00:59:01,900
their hair in braids and the whole
Internet will explode.

1444
00:59:01,901 --> 00:59:04,030
Saying that they need to pay tribute to
Africa.

1445
00:59:04,031 --> 00:59:05,020
Like the crazy.
I'm like,

1446
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:08,860
I have never in my life looked at
someone's hair and felt emotional.

1447
00:59:08,870 --> 00:59:09,880
I'm just like,
whatever you're doing,

1448
00:59:09,881 --> 00:59:12,040
your hair is fine with me.
Like if you took the time to do it,

1449
00:59:12,041 --> 00:59:13,970
it's fine with me.
But the idea is,

1450
00:59:13,971 --> 00:59:16,060
is that as a culture we've become so
fake.

1451
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:21,290
I'm just looking to get angry at things.
I think it's fake thing.

1452
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:22,000
It's fake.

1453
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,050
It's fake.
It's 100.

1454
00:59:23,090 --> 00:59:25,660
There's no person that can tell me that.
Like the first time they saw Braden,

1455
00:59:25,690 --> 00:59:28,250
someone tear and upset them.
But then somebody told them that they

1456
00:59:28,251 --> 00:59:30,550
should be upset,
but like privately when they're at home,

1457
00:59:30,551 --> 00:59:32,420
do you think they get upset when they're
watching TV?

1458
00:59:32,830 --> 00:59:34,970
I think they do.
I think there's some people to get upset

1459
00:59:34,971 --> 00:59:35,990
at a lot of stupid shit.

1460
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,610
I don't think.
I don't think they're inauthentic with

1461
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:42,030
their being upset.
I just think their focus in their anger

1462
00:59:42,031 --> 00:59:43,980
is just misguided and dumb.

1463
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:44,801
Yeah.
Maybe.

1464
00:59:44,801 --> 00:59:47,210
Maybe it's the dumb part.
Maybe it's just when it gets to dumb

1465
00:59:48,270 --> 00:59:49,970
with hoop earrings,
shit,

1466
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,880
it's like crazy.
Like Bantu Braids,

1467
00:59:51,881 --> 00:59:53,860
you need to pay tribute to the island of
Jamaica.

1468
00:59:53,861 --> 00:59:57,040
I'm like horse off.
Like you've got to be a really inspired

1469
00:59:57,041 --> 00:59:58,750
person to even look up why you're
offended.

1470
00:59:58,751 --> 01:00:01,030
Like that takes a lot of research.
Like who is researching?

1471
01:00:01,031 --> 01:00:05,410
Like who started the Bantu knots,
like who's who started the corn row.

1472
01:00:05,411 --> 01:00:07,390
I'm like,
you've got a lot of time on your hands.

1473
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:09,880
For me personally,
like if I could just not have to

1474
01:00:09,881 --> 01:00:12,730
research why I'm offended,
have a little more time.

1475
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:16,570
Ejections boom,
power grid goes down.

1476
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:20,950
Lightening storms million times greater
than anything and we wouldn't be worried

1477
01:00:20,951 --> 01:00:22,080
about braids anymore.
I know.

1478
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:23,160
It's insane.
Too easy.

1479
01:00:23,170 --> 01:00:24,420
It's too easy.
It's too easy to live.

1480
01:00:24,421 --> 01:00:25,450
There's no wolves in the street.

1481
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:27,520
There's no humor either.
That's another thing is like,

1482
01:00:27,521 --> 01:00:31,510
especially like you a former standup
comedian,

1483
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:32,373
right?
Current.

1484
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:34,960
You still buy,
but do you tore in and do you do comedy

1485
01:00:34,961 --> 01:00:39,290
or
comedy or do you.

1486
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:41,470
Okay,
so to speak.

1487
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:44,060
I don't speak ever do I speaking right
now?

1488
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:47,230
Places you do that shit.
I don't do that shit.

1489
01:00:47,850 --> 01:00:50,080
Get you on the road.
Could just be having conversations with

1490
01:00:50,081 --> 01:00:51,490
the crowd.
People love to talk to you.

1491
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:56,170
That's tiresome.
So the thing is like how is it difficult

1492
01:00:56,171 --> 01:00:59,130
when you're standing?
You can't say anything anymore because

1493
01:00:59,150 --> 01:01:01,210
like five seconds in your whole life can
be over.

1494
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:04,960
Can you just have to legitimately not
give a fuck and have a bunch of good

1495
01:01:04,961 --> 01:01:07,010
friends that you really love and you
know,

1496
01:01:07,011 --> 01:01:10,870
you surround yourself with loving people
and you all support each other and then

1497
01:01:10,871 --> 01:01:13,090
when people get mad at you,
that's what I do.

1498
01:01:13,090 --> 01:01:15,160
People don't realize.
I think they don't realize how little I

1499
01:01:15,161 --> 01:01:16,930
care about their outreach.
I've always say to myself,

1500
01:01:17,290 --> 01:01:19,090
I wonder if they knew how little I
cared.

1501
01:01:19,091 --> 01:01:22,110
If they actually write the article,
like if they actually knew how little I

1502
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:24,780
care a little.
You still talking about jake tapper and

1503
01:01:25,690 --> 01:01:28,840
fascinated by it and fascinated.
Just look at Jake tapper was like a day

1504
01:01:28,841 --> 01:01:31,030
where they all were just like,
ah,

1505
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:33,290
and then like the next day,
his fist right now.

1506
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:34,753
Yeah.
Yeah.

1507
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:36,370
Then the next day it was over like,
you know,

1508
01:01:36,371 --> 01:01:38,630
like just now with like Ben Shapiro.
It's like no one cares.

1509
01:01:38,650 --> 01:01:40,030
Like I don't care.
I know Ben doesn't care like that.

1510
01:01:40,090 --> 01:01:41,770
I don't like it.
We're going to teach other in one week,

1511
01:01:41,771 --> 01:01:44,470
like in two weeks I'm in Texas,
we're doing an event together.

1512
01:01:44,590 --> 01:01:46,060
Like I see them all the time and I like
them,

1513
01:01:46,390 --> 01:01:48,490
but like to everyone else they're
weighing in.

1514
01:01:48,491 --> 01:01:49,324
It's like,
it's like,

1515
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:51,750
so this is your business though.
This is your,

1516
01:01:51,751 --> 01:01:54,390
you're in the business of politics now.
Now this is what I want to get to.

1517
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:59,010
How do you go from being a liberal who
cried when Obama was elected?

1518
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:00,840
He's black on black.
Yay.

1519
01:02:01,110 --> 01:02:06,110
How do you go from that to being miss
conservative poster girl in 2018?

1520
01:02:06,810 --> 01:02:08,210
Because that's what you are 10 years
later.

1521
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:10,830
No,
you are like a lot of people that are

1522
01:02:10,831 --> 01:02:12,270
conservative.
They love the fact that you're

1523
01:02:12,271 --> 01:02:13,380
attractive,
you're smart,

1524
01:02:13,381 --> 01:02:15,840
you're articulate,
you're black and you,

1525
01:02:15,870 --> 01:02:19,470
you're fucking forceful with your
thoughts and ideas and you them through

1526
01:02:19,471 --> 01:02:20,300
quick and

1527
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:23,790
you're not scared of pissing people off.
And this is very exciting to

1528
01:02:23,791 --> 01:02:25,290
conservative people that are on the
sidelines.

1529
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:28,320
It's like we got fucking great running
back,

1530
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,080
you know,
we're going to win the superbowl this

1531
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:31,360
year.
Like that's how they look at you like

1532
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:33,720
you're,
you're like a great soldier in the

1533
01:02:33,721 --> 01:02:35,460
field.
That's how people look at it.

1534
01:02:35,490 --> 01:02:36,323
That's fine.
You know,

1535
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:38,340
I appreciate that.
So how do you go from that?

1536
01:02:38,370 --> 01:02:41,760
What happened to reconcile?
What happened to me in high school?

1537
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:47,250
We got to that and then we got off track
two things that I wanted to correct the

1538
01:02:47,461 --> 01:02:49,110
world.
I guess I wanted to correct what had

1539
01:02:49,111 --> 01:02:50,760
happened to me,
so the first thing was I launched a

1540
01:02:50,761 --> 01:02:53,010
website,
like a blog for young girls that were

1541
01:02:53,011 --> 01:02:56,300
going through things I had gotten out of
the eating disorder and I wanted to just

1542
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:58,350
give girls that may be going through
something a way to.

1543
01:02:58,350 --> 01:02:58,921
Right,
right.

1544
01:02:58,921 --> 01:03:00,450
So I do I build this blog,
would you go and eat?

1545
01:03:00,451 --> 01:03:01,590
I tell them they can write whatever they
want.

1546
01:03:01,591 --> 01:03:03,690
That was the first thing.
The second thing I wanted to do was to

1547
01:03:03,691 --> 01:03:07,080
combat like I felt and I still feel in
my soul that children today are growing

1548
01:03:07,081 --> 01:03:11,190
up in a time that people can't,
don't even stop to think about,

1549
01:03:11,191 --> 01:03:13,080
we have 10 year olds that are killing
themselves over snapchat.

1550
01:03:14,430 --> 01:03:16,560
Like if someone posts a picture on
snapchat and they killed themselves,

1551
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:19,770
you know,
and no one has really thought about how

1552
01:03:19,771 --> 01:03:23,100
much technology has negatively impacted
the ability for a child to grow up.

1553
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:25,170
Right?
But they're concerned about the way they

1554
01:03:25,171 --> 01:03:27,300
look.
Like I used to Babysit name to put

1555
01:03:27,301 --> 01:03:32,301
myself through some years of college and
I'm a nanny for these kids.

1556
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:34,560
So they care about how they look when I
was 10.

1557
01:03:34,630 --> 01:03:38,180
Like I didn't care how I looked,
I didn't even know how I looked at it.

1558
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:40,110
I definitely didn't have seen the
pictures.

1559
01:03:40,111 --> 01:03:40,950
Right.
So,

1560
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:43,950
so,
and now we have kids color.

1561
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,200
Just so the second thing I wanted to do,
I said I have this great idea that I'm

1562
01:03:47,210 --> 01:03:48,940
going to build this project.
Um,

1563
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,640
and this is,
this is the,

1564
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:53,430
the,
the social autopsy bit that the

1565
01:03:53,431 --> 01:03:55,590
youtubers were freaking out about and
they thought that it was a political

1566
01:03:55,591 --> 01:03:57,840
machine and it was going to be to help
children.

1567
01:03:57,870 --> 01:04:00,990
I found that
it never launched.

1568
01:04:00,991 --> 01:04:05,070
It was an idea that I had to build
something that would be like screenshots

1569
01:04:05,071 --> 01:04:07,640
of what people said online and like to
put them in like a timeout.

1570
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:08,820
So I literally,
we were going around,

1571
01:04:08,821 --> 01:04:11,770
we were meeting with high school,
like high schools and saying like,

1572
01:04:11,790 --> 01:04:13,920
we're thinking about building something
for children that.

1573
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:17,100
So instead of going to prison,
because you send a mean tweet or a snap,

1574
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:20,280
like what if you just couldn't like trap
for the football team,

1575
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:22,710
you know what I mean?
Like what if like your teachers to check

1576
01:04:22,711 --> 01:04:24,630
the database to see like how you're
behaving online.

1577
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:28,480
Was it like naive going back like sure,
like it.

1578
01:04:28,590 --> 01:04:32,340
But the idea that the feedback that we
were getting from principals was like

1579
01:04:32,341 --> 01:04:35,190
first try it on adults because like if
this goes awry,

1580
01:04:35,191 --> 01:04:37,770
like to do this for children is not
going to be a great idea.

1581
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:40,620
So I started kickstart her saying that
I'm raising money for this project to

1582
01:04:40,621 --> 01:04:44,970
help combat online bullying.
Like it was like a project that was so

1583
01:04:44,971 --> 01:04:48,060
from the heart,
it was just like trying to rectify the

1584
01:04:48,061 --> 01:04:52,320
wrongs that I felt were done for these
kids that aggressed me,

1585
01:04:52,470 --> 01:04:53,610
you know,
in high school.

1586
01:04:53,970 --> 01:04:56,400
And instead I ended up in the middle of
a firestorm again.

1587
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:58,140
It's unbelievable.
I was like,

1588
01:04:58,141 --> 01:05:01,880
God really?
I'm a Gamer Gate scandal like that.

1589
01:05:02,070 --> 01:05:03,000
Do you know about this?
Um,

1590
01:05:03,001 --> 01:05:06,210
you've spoken to my leg.
So I knew nothing about it.

1591
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:07,420
It wasn't a Gamer,
I wasn't lying,

1592
01:05:07,430 --> 01:05:08,790
I wasn't politics,
nothing about it,

1593
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:11,610
um,
but I put this kickstarter up saying

1594
01:05:11,611 --> 01:05:13,860
like,
what we're doing is figuratively lifting

1595
01:05:13,861 --> 01:05:18,010
the masks off of trolls and the Internet
lost its mind.

1596
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:20,740
It lost its mind.
And a girl named Zoe Quinn who was

1597
01:05:20,741 --> 01:05:23,860
patient,
one of the Gamer Gate scandal calls me

1598
01:05:23,861 --> 01:05:27,710
and at this point she was working for
twitter as the official anti harassment

1599
01:05:27,711 --> 01:05:30,550
or twitter and she basically threatens
me and tells me to kill the project.

1600
01:05:31,450 --> 01:05:34,840
And I had no idea at the bread and
butter of the Gamer Gate scandal called

1601
01:05:35,070 --> 01:05:36,490
me on the phone.
She contacted me via twitter.

1602
01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:40,630
My numbers were threatened first she
started off with like,

1603
01:05:40,660 --> 01:05:42,610
I'm the girl that was the victim of
Gamergate.

1604
01:05:42,610 --> 01:05:45,610
And instantly to me it was all people
don't wear a victim like a badge.

1605
01:05:45,611 --> 01:05:48,520
Like I knew this because I had gone
through this in high school and she was

1606
01:05:48,521 --> 01:05:49,660
like,
I'm telling you why you need to kill

1607
01:05:49,661 --> 01:05:51,230
your project immediately.
Um,

1608
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:53,410
because there are people,
you know,

1609
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:56,620
there are that harassed me and they will
harass you if they find out about it.

1610
01:05:56,621 --> 01:05:57,700
I'm trying to save you,
like,

1611
01:05:57,701 --> 01:05:58,540
you know,
and I was Kinda like,

1612
01:05:58,570 --> 01:05:59,560
you know,
I appreciate that and I'd be like,

1613
01:05:59,561 --> 01:06:01,510
no thank you.
And then she got like,

1614
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:04,510
you know,
increasingly like you have to kill this

1615
01:06:04,511 --> 01:06:05,890
project.
And then she started crying.

1616
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,860
It was like very bizarre phone call.
I'm super confused.

1617
01:06:08,861 --> 01:06:12,550
So your project was to take the masks
off trolls.

1618
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:14,710
Figuratively.
We'd never had built a technology.

1619
01:06:14,711 --> 01:06:17,290
We never like what we were saying,
like what we were going to literally do

1620
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:22,320
was archive facebook messages because
kids on the Internet will being

1621
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:24,720
ruthless.

1622
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:25,301
Yeah,
fine.

1623
01:06:25,301 --> 01:06:28,510
Their messages and archive it.
So why don't you have an issue with

1624
01:06:28,511 --> 01:06:29,260
this?
I don't understand.

1625
01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:31,960
My kickstarter said,
I guess I said a word that made them

1626
01:06:31,961 --> 01:06:34,120
think that we were going to be able to
unmask twitter trolls,

1627
01:06:34,121 --> 01:06:37,540
like a tow something that we had never
even thought of that like literally like

1628
01:06:37,541 --> 01:06:42,250
that we were gonna be able to like build
the technology name is going to be like

1629
01:06:42,390 --> 01:06:45,190
that's Joe Rogan.
No,

1630
01:06:45,610 --> 01:06:47,110
we did not build this.
This is like crazy.

1631
01:06:47,111 --> 01:06:49,750
Like we literally had an idea to a
better place.

1632
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:52,780
If I know I actually not opposed to
that,

1633
01:06:52,781 --> 01:06:54,370
but we weren't building it,
you know,

1634
01:06:54,371 --> 01:06:56,120
that was she opposed to it.
That's why I'm so,

1635
01:06:56,330 --> 01:06:57,730
you know,
the bread and butter of the Gamer Gate

1636
01:06:57,731 --> 01:06:59,650
scandal is that people say she harassed
herself.

1637
01:07:00,670 --> 01:07:02,440
Okay.
I didn't know this.

1638
01:07:02,530 --> 01:07:03,790
I just hung up the phone with her.

1639
01:07:03,910 --> 01:07:06,640
Yeah.
I hung up the phone with her and she was

1640
01:07:06,641 --> 01:07:08,740
like,
if you go through with this project her,

1641
01:07:08,741 --> 01:07:11,290
these were her last words,
you're going to ruin everything.

1642
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:13,540
Crying and hangs up the phone.
I was like,

1643
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:14,480
what?
Oh.

1644
01:07:15,830 --> 01:07:19,730
So you're saying that people think this
is the Gamer Gate scandal.

1645
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:24,900
She harassed herself in order to get the
left media helped her and launched like

1646
01:07:25,481 --> 01:07:27,610
a thousand charities.
Like all of these girls harassed

1647
01:07:27,611 --> 01:07:29,410
themselves.
So this is like literally why Milo's

1648
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:31,550
some people have definitely harassed
themselves.

1649
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:32,350
Yes.
And the whole,

1650
01:07:32,350 --> 01:07:35,890
she was the first person that this
started with and everyone of these

1651
01:07:35,891 --> 01:07:36,790
gamers like,
mind you,

1652
01:07:36,791 --> 01:07:38,950
I'm a Gamer.
I'm just telling you the two sides that

1653
01:07:38,951 --> 01:07:40,840
I walked into,
I didn't know.

1654
01:07:40,841 --> 01:07:42,640
So I hang up the phone with her and nice
and a tweet that was like,

1655
01:07:42,641 --> 01:07:45,070
don't know who zoe Quinn is and I can
tell you this girl has never been

1656
01:07:45,071 --> 01:07:48,990
harassed and the world breaks what I was
going to say.

1657
01:07:48,990 --> 01:07:50,250
My,
the finished resends.

1658
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:53,500
I know some people have harassed
themselves.

1659
01:07:53,501 --> 01:07:56,320
They faked it,
but way more people have actually been

1660
01:07:56,321 --> 01:07:58,480
harassed.
I'm sure I agree.

1661
01:07:58,481 --> 01:08:01,600
I'm just saying that her in particular
and you say by talking to her,

1662
01:08:01,601 --> 01:08:02,860
she's never been around 100.
I,

1663
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:03,321
dude,
I,

1664
01:08:03,321 --> 01:08:06,970
I know like I'm telling you,
victims don't like,

1665
01:08:06,971 --> 01:08:10,410
you would never like be like I'm the
victim of it.

1666
01:08:10,411 --> 01:08:14,220
It's something that you know,
here,

1667
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,100
here that's the story.
So I hang up the phone with her.

1668
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:20,540
I tweet this within one hour we start
getting inundated.

1669
01:08:20,541 --> 01:08:21,410
Just like she said,
she said,

1670
01:08:21,411 --> 01:08:23,990
if you don't kill the project,
I mean trump supporters are going to

1671
01:08:23,991 --> 01:08:26,090
come after you and start harassing you.
Like literally,

1672
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:31,120
like we're getting inundated with emails
that say like Bob@trumpfortyfive.com and

1673
01:08:31,551 --> 01:08:34,880
they're like die and were die.
Like if you go through it like we're

1674
01:08:34,881 --> 01:08:35,990
going kill it,
just like the most,

1675
01:08:35,991 --> 01:08:37,700
like I was like,
well this is kind of perfect,

1676
01:08:37,701 --> 01:08:37,970
right?

1677
01:08:37,970 --> 01:08:42,170
Like you warn me and then it happens.
Like within an hour we had had no

1678
01:08:42,171 --> 01:08:43,070
messages,
nothing,

1679
01:08:43,071 --> 01:08:45,400
and then all of a sudden I was full on
like,

1680
01:08:45,410 --> 01:08:46,011
and I was like,
no,

1681
01:08:46,011 --> 01:08:46,940
no,
no sweetheart,

1682
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:48,800
you did this like you aren't restricted
this.

1683
01:08:48,860 --> 01:08:50,990
And she had been accused of doing this
like five times.

1684
01:08:50,991 --> 01:08:54,200
Like it wasn't like Milo and Breitbart.
We're just covering all of the instances

1685
01:08:54,350 --> 01:08:57,920
that people have accused her of like she
calls them and then they get harassed.

1686
01:08:57,980 --> 01:09:00,590
She calls them and then they get
harassed and I didn't give up.

1687
01:09:00,650 --> 01:09:02,360
I had no horse in the race.
I don't care about,

1688
01:09:02,361 --> 01:09:03,860
you know,
gamers respectfully.

1689
01:09:03,861 --> 01:09:06,350
I don't game right.
I didn't care about politics,

1690
01:09:06,410 --> 01:09:07,520
you know,
respectfully.

1691
01:09:07,521 --> 01:09:10,670
At that time it wasn't politicking.
I just had a phone call with the girl.

1692
01:09:10,810 --> 01:09:12,530
It was a little weird phone call and
then I suddenly,

1693
01:09:12,531 --> 01:09:16,380
I was getting inundated with emails and
just making youtube videos at the time.

1694
01:09:16,430 --> 01:09:18,620
No,
I was literally like fully doing this

1695
01:09:18,621 --> 01:09:21,560
degree with anything and I was going to
really try to build this high school,

1696
01:09:21,561 --> 01:09:24,590
like this thing to help kids that
everyone says you docs minors like

1697
01:09:24,591 --> 01:09:26,960
literally like we were building this
platform is that children will never

1698
01:09:26,961 --> 01:09:29,720
have to be like get in serious trouble
for doing stupid stuff.

1699
01:09:29,721 --> 01:09:32,390
Like via technology ever.
How did she get your contact?

1700
01:09:32,391 --> 01:09:33,560
She messaged me.
I gave it to her.

1701
01:09:33,561 --> 01:09:35,780
She messaged me on twitter,
like she was burnt,

1702
01:09:35,781 --> 01:09:39,380
which are something that you and I,
I like it literally her Hannah was burnt

1703
01:09:39,381 --> 01:09:41,930
rich and like at that time I wasn't even
like on twitter,

1704
01:09:41,931 --> 01:09:45,140
like I had just made a twitter profile
and I see someone that has a check mark

1705
01:09:45,290 --> 01:09:47,060
and it says like official whatever
handle of twitter.

1706
01:09:47,061 --> 01:09:49,130
So what seems more official than like a
check mark?

1707
01:09:49,130 --> 01:09:51,410
And so I was like here's my number,
call me.

1708
01:09:51,411 --> 01:09:52,330
We'd love to talk.
Like,

1709
01:09:52,370 --> 01:09:54,760
you know,
you're going to have a conversation with

1710
01:09:55,190 --> 01:09:57,860
that maybe wants to partner with me
because I'm like oh this girl's been

1711
01:09:57,861 --> 01:09:59,780
harassed on the Internet.
Like maybe she'll like want to help

1712
01:09:59,781 --> 01:10:00,614
kids,
like,

1713
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:03,050
you know,
like Alice in Wonderland,

1714
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:07,340
like totally like insane alice in
wonderland and then like all of a sudden

1715
01:10:07,341 --> 01:10:09,470
there's like a Cheshire cat who's like
smoking.

1716
01:10:09,570 --> 01:10:14,570
So you think that someone orchestrated
this attack at 100 percent fake trump

1717
01:10:15,351 --> 01:10:18,170
supporters that we're going after that.
That was my,

1718
01:10:18,171 --> 01:10:19,040
like I was like,
oh,

1719
01:10:19,070 --> 01:10:20,760
how can we,
we've been on kickstarter for three days

1720
01:10:20,761 --> 01:10:23,180
and no one has harassed us.
You call me and tell me killed a project

1721
01:10:23,181 --> 01:10:25,570
or I'm going to get harassed.
I hang up the phone with you and now or

1722
01:10:25,571 --> 01:10:27,340
later we're getting inundated with
harassment people.

1723
01:10:27,350 --> 01:10:30,090
She was saying that you were going to
get harassed by trump supporters.

1724
01:10:30,510 --> 01:10:32,480
She said she,
she didn't say trump supporters.

1725
01:10:32,510 --> 01:10:34,360
They all have their addresses happened
to be like,

1726
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:36,560
you know,
like trump 45 at ge,

1727
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:39,770
whatever it was like they would,
they would actually have like weird porn

1728
01:10:40,130 --> 01:10:40,751
handles.
Like,

1729
01:10:40,751 --> 01:10:41,810
I don't know,
like weird handles,

1730
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:42,651
you know?
I still have them.

1731
01:10:42,651 --> 01:10:45,170
I would have to pull it up.
Why did she think that someone was going

1732
01:10:45,171 --> 01:10:45,921
to harass you?
That's,

1733
01:10:45,921 --> 01:10:49,160
I'm still confused.
She was saying she was trolls.

1734
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:51,050
Yeah,
and that's what she said when the

1735
01:10:51,051 --> 01:10:53,620
Gamergate people like these,
these anonymous men who were harassed

1736
01:10:53,630 --> 01:10:54,770
people,
the people that harassed me,

1737
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:56,120
when they see what you're working on,
they're gonna,

1738
01:10:56,180 --> 01:10:57,620
they're gonna Freak out,
you can't do it.

1739
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:58,790
They've ruined my life.
You know,

1740
01:10:58,820 --> 01:10:59,780
she's.
And then she started saying,

1741
01:10:59,781 --> 01:11:00,770
you're going to get doxed.

1742
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:02,450
They're going to find out what your
parent lives.

1743
01:11:02,451 --> 01:11:06,080
And like literally after that someone
sent me like a map and they had dogs to

1744
01:11:06,081 --> 01:11:07,560
my family,
like my grandmother,

1745
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:09,560
like where she lives,
my grandfather.

1746
01:11:09,561 --> 01:11:13,960
Like it was just like,
was what she said was going to happen to

1747
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:16,880
you contacting her.
So you think that she did.

1748
01:11:17,610 --> 01:11:19,380
She did it like I've said this a
thousand times.

1749
01:11:19,381 --> 01:11:20,730
I said,
and then the second I said it,

1750
01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:23,310
all of a sudden the New York magazine in
the Washington Post tried to smear me

1751
01:11:23,490 --> 01:11:24,900
instantly.
Instantly.

1752
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:27,750
At that time I thought,
no,

1753
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:31,320
it's not implausible with the timeframe
of getting no.

1754
01:11:31,410 --> 01:11:35,670
Nobody messaging me right.
To her calling me all of this flooding

1755
01:11:35,671 --> 01:11:36,930
in.
And then the New York magazine,

1756
01:11:36,990 --> 01:11:39,810
I was a girl on kickstarter,
why the hell is the Washington Post

1757
01:11:39,811 --> 01:11:42,930
calling me after I tweet this girl
harassed yourself,

1758
01:11:42,931 --> 01:11:47,520
the Washington Post New York magazine,
the usual suspects right now,

1759
01:11:47,521 --> 01:11:47,880
the usual.

1760
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:49,140
So at that time I was like,
oh great.

1761
01:11:49,170 --> 01:11:51,270
The Washington Post,
I was like,

1762
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:52,900
totally an idiot.
Um,

1763
01:11:53,290 --> 01:11:54,840
you know,
we're rushing to say like,

1764
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:56,040
oh,
candice got confused.

1765
01:11:56,041 --> 01:11:56,521
Like it's,
it's,

1766
01:11:56,521 --> 01:11:58,500
it's been a long time internet
conspiracy.

1767
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:01,110
So we Quinn's harassed herself and
Canada's got sucked in and like,

1768
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:03,210
I don't even know what Gamergate is.
I don't know,

1769
01:12:03,330 --> 01:12:04,790
like,
I don't even know this article is about,

1770
01:12:04,810 --> 01:12:08,040
had no idea that there was accusations
that she had arrived.

1771
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:09,440
Zero,
none.

1772
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:13,080
The hall been harassed.
It's an instinct.

1773
01:12:13,110 --> 01:12:16,350
One instinct.
And I got in the middle of a cultural

1774
01:12:16,350 --> 01:12:18,360
war and people were like,
get in touch with Nero.

1775
01:12:18,361 --> 01:12:19,021
I'm like,
fuck,

1776
01:12:19,021 --> 01:12:21,470
is nero was Milo Yiannopoulos or the
tucker again,

1777
01:12:21,510 --> 01:12:23,310
just like,
even though like you just like landed.

1778
01:12:23,311 --> 01:12:25,590
And then people that I thought were
white nationalists,

1779
01:12:25,710 --> 01:12:28,410
which was like,
Breitbart was the only publication that

1780
01:12:28,411 --> 01:12:30,420
was like just telling the truth about
what's happening.

1781
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:32,060
Like just saying like,
this girl jumped on kickstarter this

1782
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:34,380
like,
she's no pulling no leg in this race to

1783
01:12:34,430 --> 01:12:35,730
nonpolitical.
I'm not end like,

1784
01:12:36,150 --> 01:12:38,170
this is what she says happened.
So it was just a,

1785
01:12:38,430 --> 01:12:42,690
it was a very bizarre situation.
But it changed my life because the

1786
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:47,580
people that I would have thought in that
moment would have like come after me and

1787
01:12:47,581 --> 01:12:51,780
said awful things about me or said like,
we're the people that were very kind,

1788
01:12:51,810 --> 01:12:52,501
like,
you know,

1789
01:12:52,501 --> 01:12:53,940
at that time I would've said I was a
liberal,

1790
01:12:53,970 --> 01:12:55,170
you know,
I would have said like,

1791
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:58,470
you know,
I supported Bernie Sanders or Hillary

1792
01:12:58,470 --> 01:12:58,591
Clinton,
you know,

1793
01:12:58,591 --> 01:13:00,540
whatever it was.
He probably wasn't politically active.

1794
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:05,130
And people that were like reaching down
and just being kind were like Mike

1795
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:06,900
Cernovich,
who if I googled his name,

1796
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:09,360
said it was,
he was like a white supremacist.

1797
01:13:09,390 --> 01:13:12,720
So it just was like a weird thing.

1798
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:15,300
Like my whole life just went like,
I was like,

1799
01:13:15,310 --> 01:13:15,990
well,
okay.

1800
01:13:15,990 --> 01:13:18,300
So one interaction,
that's all it took.

1801
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:23,100
It's a subsequent firestorm.
Is there ever been any proof at all

1802
01:13:23,230 --> 01:13:26,460
who's done what you think she did?
Just a bunch of people saying the same

1803
01:13:26,461 --> 01:13:28,980
thing that had nothing to do with one
another in different situations and the

1804
01:13:28,981 --> 01:13:31,570
media refusing to,
to um,

1805
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:34,650
so like one of those blamed the victim
things nobody wants,

1806
01:13:35,450 --> 01:13:38,520
unless there's just overwhelming and she
never responds like I've said it,

1807
01:13:38,530 --> 01:13:40,060
a thousand things.
Like she harassed her,

1808
01:13:40,061 --> 01:13:43,080
like she never responds and I stick by
that.

1809
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:45,420
I'll never veer from that.
And it was.

1810
01:13:45,570 --> 01:13:47,250
But I always say that was,
that was my moment,

1811
01:13:47,251 --> 01:13:49,680
like this project that I had never even
built out.

1812
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,270
Um,
that changed everything.

1813
01:13:52,271 --> 01:13:56,720
I like,
I stopped the project and I subsequently

1814
01:13:56,730 --> 01:13:58,650
just wanted to learn.
Like I just like,

1815
01:13:58,651 --> 01:14:02,640
is it possible that I got to 26 years
old and have everything wrong about

1816
01:14:02,641 --> 01:14:04,090
people that I thought,
you know,

1817
01:14:04,150 --> 01:14:05,820
I was just believing in the background.

1818
01:14:05,850 --> 01:14:08,640
You know,
that anybody that CNN said this one

1819
01:14:08,641 --> 01:14:12,190
interaction with one person that may or
not be deceptive,

1820
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:15,220
why would that make you switch political
affiliation?

1821
01:14:15,470 --> 01:14:17,260
It was even switching.
I wasn't politically active.

1822
01:14:17,261 --> 01:14:20,020
I just like if you had asked me,
I would've said I wasn't.

1823
01:14:20,090 --> 01:14:21,190
You know what I'm saying?
Like I was never,

1824
01:14:21,191 --> 01:14:23,170
I was never a girl wearing a pussy hat
outside.

1825
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:25,690
Like people don't understand if if
chest,

1826
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:26,553
no,
God,

1827
01:14:26,830 --> 01:14:31,830
if press now that I think of like where
I'm at now and talking about how I hate

1828
01:14:32,261 --> 01:14:34,210
labels,
I was probably already a conservative

1829
01:14:34,211 --> 01:14:37,720
but I didn't give a shit about politics.
I had $100,000 in student loan debt and

1830
01:14:37,721 --> 01:14:39,490
I was just trying to pay back.
That's it.

1831
01:14:39,491 --> 01:14:41,680
That was my whole life.
There was nothing about politics,

1832
01:14:41,890 --> 01:14:44,560
but at that moment it made me,
it was forced to me to consider my

1833
01:14:44,950 --> 01:14:48,040
political affiliations because I had me
saying this.

1834
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:49,330
I'm saying like,
you know,

1835
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,340
the New York magazine like tried to
smear me.

1836
01:14:51,341 --> 01:14:54,520
I say the Washington Post I just made me
at the exact same time Donald Trump is

1837
01:14:54,521 --> 01:14:56,230
getting on a stage and he's saying
they're fake news.

1838
01:14:56,620 --> 01:14:59,880
It was just this divine moment trying to
smear you.

1839
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:02,240
So they called me and pretended to be my
friend.

1840
01:15:02,241 --> 01:15:03,760
I'm like,
we just wanna know what happened.

1841
01:15:03,761 --> 01:15:06,370
Like I told him the story,
I gave him messages of like Zoe,

1842
01:15:06,371 --> 01:15:10,150
the timestamps that the hate vibe and
receiving and then the articles that

1843
01:15:10,151 --> 01:15:11,800
they wrote were like the.
I'm like,

1844
01:15:12,190 --> 01:15:13,480
dude,
I just have a conversation with you on

1845
01:15:13,481 --> 01:15:14,980
the phone.
Like insane stuff.

1846
01:15:14,981 --> 01:15:16,510
Like,
I mean I'm like,

1847
01:15:16,511 --> 01:15:18,220
you know,
the Washington Post actually,

1848
01:15:18,221 --> 01:15:22,360
because I caught them in a lie.
I recorded the conversation and the

1849
01:15:22,361 --> 01:15:25,660
email of what she wrote didn't match.
They pulled the article.

1850
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:27,030
I said,
if you run this article,

1851
01:15:27,150 --> 01:15:28,660
I will sue you guys for libel.

1852
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:30,430
And the manager pulled the article and
he was like,

1853
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:31,780
you're not even relevant or even
important.

1854
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:34,670
Really.
We don't have to run this article I'm

1855
01:15:34,750 --> 01:15:35,680
writing.
I still have it.

1856
01:15:35,710 --> 01:15:37,520
They were ready to lie.
They were ready to lie.

1857
01:15:38,470 --> 01:15:41,350
They were trying to make it.
They were trying to make it seem that I

1858
01:15:41,351 --> 01:15:44,020
had like they were trying to figure out
who was funding.

1859
01:15:44,050 --> 01:15:47,620
So like social autopsy was what that was
the like what the journalists were

1860
01:15:47,621 --> 01:15:48,790
trying to figure out for whatever
reason,

1861
01:15:48,791 --> 01:15:51,220
like who's helping you.
So when I refused to say any names,

1862
01:15:51,221 --> 01:15:53,020
I just got that weird gut feeling on the
phone.

1863
01:15:53,021 --> 01:15:54,010
Like I'm like,
why are you like,

1864
01:15:54,011 --> 01:15:55,660
I'm telling you like,
this girl has been harassing her.

1865
01:15:55,661 --> 01:15:58,420
So why are you trying to figure out
where I'm getting money from?

1866
01:15:58,480 --> 01:15:59,510
You know?
Um,

1867
01:15:59,710 --> 01:16:03,100
and when I refuse to answer the,
the girl was going to like,

1868
01:16:03,130 --> 01:16:07,330
lied and tried to say that I had said
certain names that she was just trying

1869
01:16:07,331 --> 01:16:11,740
to get like other anti bullying,
like organizations to come out and say I

1870
01:16:11,741 --> 01:16:12,310
was a liar.

1871
01:16:12,310 --> 01:16:15,430
Like say I was working with them but I
had never said any names throughout the

1872
01:16:15,431 --> 01:16:18,970
phone and somebody gave me a tip.
Like one of the antique,

1873
01:16:18,990 --> 01:16:21,460
I'm not gonna say the name of the.
They gave me a tip and said that,

1874
01:16:21,630 --> 01:16:23,690
you know,
they called and you know,

1875
01:16:23,710 --> 01:16:24,760
did you tell them this?
And I was like,

1876
01:16:24,761 --> 01:16:25,421
no.
I was like,

1877
01:16:25,421 --> 01:16:27,160
I literally have the recording.
And they were like,

1878
01:16:27,161 --> 01:16:30,520
you need to lawyer up like the
Washington Post is trying to smear you

1879
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:32,740
if.
Because he just wasn't that they said

1880
01:16:32,741 --> 01:16:36,700
that you hadn't said they were trying to
say that they were basically going to

1881
01:16:36,701 --> 01:16:41,701
try to get a really reputable
anti-bullying company to issue a strong

1882
01:16:41,741 --> 01:16:44,800
statement against me calling me a liar,
but this company,

1883
01:16:44,801 --> 01:16:47,170
because I had been in touch with them
because I had been on the phone with

1884
01:16:47,171 --> 01:16:49,510
them,
had a sense that it just wasn't like

1885
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:51,430
they didn't feel good out the reporter
either,

1886
01:16:51,590 --> 01:16:54,730
so they gave me a heads up.
I had actually recorded the conversation

1887
01:16:54,731 --> 01:16:57,970
with the Washington Post was in the
conversation that they didn't want to

1888
01:16:57,971 --> 01:17:00,370
prove they were going to print.
That like I said,

1889
01:17:00,371 --> 01:17:05,290
that this company was supporting me and
they reached out to that company and

1890
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:07,820
that company denied it,
but I had never said that they was just

1891
01:17:07,821 --> 01:17:09,890
the way to say that I was a liar.
I never said it.

1892
01:17:10,110 --> 01:17:12,290
You get what I'm saying?
The conversation.

1893
01:17:12,540 --> 01:17:14,470
Oh,
my instinct was just like,

1894
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:18,380
record the conversation.
So imagine like you go through that and

1895
01:17:18,381 --> 01:17:20,000
then Donald Trump gets on the stage and
he was like,

1896
01:17:20,001 --> 01:17:21,940
Washington Post is fake news.
Jeff Bezos is like,

1897
01:17:22,010 --> 01:17:25,550
it was just like this,
like order things from Amazon.

1898
01:17:26,350 --> 01:17:29,010
I.
It's awful.

1899
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:30,620
I know that one click.
I know.

1900
01:17:31,010 --> 01:17:33,800
It's just amazing.
I know I shouldn't.

1901
01:17:33,801 --> 01:17:35,230
I shouldn't,
but what do you need?

1902
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:36,390
Crazy glue,
Bab.

1903
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,060
I hear there's another company coming
out and

1904
01:17:41,150 --> 01:17:44,000
he's got us all.
I know I lot shit off Amazon.

1905
01:17:44,030 --> 01:17:44,870
I know.
I know.

1906
01:17:44,871 --> 01:17:46,190
I do too.
I can't even deny it.

1907
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:48,380
I know.
It just shows it's there.

1908
01:17:48,381 --> 01:17:49,880
It's just when you get home,
it's there.

1909
01:17:49,940 --> 01:17:52,550
It's home to you know.
Do you think he has anything to do with

1910
01:17:52,551 --> 01:17:54,640
the Washington Post?
Because he bought it.

1911
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:58,820
It's his personal diary.
Now of course,

1912
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:02,570
if you have you seen the stuff that they
were their publishing show subscribe to

1913
01:18:02,571 --> 01:18:05,780
it online,
meaning I pay to get it online,

1914
01:18:05,810 --> 01:18:06,890
pay for propaganda.

1915
01:18:07,290 --> 01:18:08,850
Well occasionally I have a good story.
Yeah,

1916
01:18:09,620 --> 01:18:11,350
it's all it's propaganda.
I,

1917
01:18:11,351 --> 01:18:13,330
I can't take any other article series
this up.

1918
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:17,140
They've run and that they've said it's
just like it just everything.

1919
01:18:17,250 --> 01:18:20,680
I mean like the stuff that you read like
the Washington Post lately.

1920
01:18:20,690 --> 01:18:22,310
Do you like what was the last good
article?

1921
01:18:22,311 --> 01:18:24,260
Let me ask you,
what was the last that you thought this

1922
01:18:24,261 --> 01:18:27,310
was a fair and balanced reporting job by
Washington Post?

1923
01:18:27,311 --> 01:18:29,480
They don't hate trump.
They just went to report the news.

1924
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:31,340
Difficult question,
because I read too many articles.

1925
01:18:31,341 --> 01:18:34,250
I'd have to go back and see which one.
What's the number one?

1926
01:18:34,251 --> 01:18:36,960
What's the number one article on the top
of today?

1927
01:18:37,010 --> 01:18:38,960
Right now?
That would be an interesting question.

1928
01:18:39,220 --> 01:18:41,090
Let's get.
Let's get a trump.

1929
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:42,200
I'm going to go ahead with it out there.

1930
01:18:44,690 --> 01:18:47,480
Will.
It could be saying because it correlates

1931
01:18:47,481 --> 01:18:48,450
to trump.
Maybe it's,

1932
01:18:48,451 --> 01:18:49,580
uh,
what's her face be?

1933
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:53,390
They're going to burn me that story.
Okay.

1934
01:18:53,391 --> 01:18:55,790
Lynn manual.
Miranda metal.

1935
01:18:55,791 --> 01:19:00,791
Tariffs trigger retaliation from Mexico.
I will trade war that Samantha Bee,

1936
01:19:02,931 --> 01:19:04,580
apologize.
After White House.

1937
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:08,310
Couldn't condemnation calling Ivanka
trump a vulgar word I went to.

1938
01:19:09,670 --> 01:19:12,890
They're forgiving her.
Forgiving her in that.

1939
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:14,170
Just thinking of the headlines.
Yeah.

1940
01:19:14,220 --> 01:19:16,910
She apologized and she looks nice in
that picture.

1941
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:20,880
Will be forgiving her.
She apologizes after combination.

1942
01:19:21,350 --> 01:19:25,350
Ivanka trump a word.
Why don't they just can come on camera

1943
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:28,640
for airing the word.
Oh,

1944
01:19:28,641 --> 01:19:30,560
they did it on TV.
Wait a minute.

1945
01:19:31,010 --> 01:19:36,010
Wait a minute was on her TV show.
Cut The fuck was on TV.

1946
01:19:36,231 --> 01:19:40,850
It's insane.
That's tbs had to apologize to tbs said

1947
01:19:40,860 --> 01:19:41,750
Gunt.
No,

1948
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:46,960
it was on her shows on tbs say cunt.
Like the word they just apologize for.

1949
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:47,501
No,
no,

1950
01:19:47,501 --> 01:19:49,790
no.
I'm saying did they air the actual word

1951
01:19:49,791 --> 01:19:51,410
or did they beat.
I don't know.

1952
01:19:51,411 --> 01:19:52,330
That's a good question.
Yes.

1953
01:19:52,331 --> 01:19:55,220
You remember when Steven Colbert,
when he,

1954
01:19:55,221 --> 01:19:56,090
uh,
he said he,

1955
01:19:56,091 --> 01:20:00,920
that trump uses a Putin uses trump's
mouth for his cock holster.

1956
01:20:02,170 --> 01:20:03,570
That shit's crazy.
That's what I'm,

1957
01:20:04,010 --> 01:20:08,330
that's what I'm saying.
They would lose their mind.

1958
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:11,220
Just imagine.
Imagine people that get it the worst are

1959
01:20:11,221 --> 01:20:14,700
black conservatives like that.
Like we get the things that people say

1960
01:20:14,701 --> 01:20:16,950
to us.
And what's bizarre now is white

1961
01:20:16,951 --> 01:20:17,460
liberals,
like,

1962
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:18,720
they just feel comfortable.
So I'm like,

1963
01:20:18,721 --> 01:20:20,400
why to like this?
It's like so weird.

1964
01:20:20,401 --> 01:20:22,020
They'll,
they'll write and they'll say anything

1965
01:20:22,021 --> 01:20:24,350
to me.
TBS networks.

1966
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:26,450
It's taking the right action,
the right action,

1967
01:20:26,451 --> 01:20:31,290
and apologizing for the vial and
inappropriate language used about Ivanka

1968
01:20:31,291 --> 01:20:33,540
trump last night.
Those words should not have been aired.

1969
01:20:33,660 --> 01:20:34,860
It was our mistake too.

1970
01:20:34,860 --> 01:20:36,760
And we regretted,
what is this?

1971
01:20:37,020 --> 01:20:41,640
I do not like the way they worded that
she's taken the right action.

1972
01:20:41,700 --> 01:20:42,533
So they,
they,

1973
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:47,600
they have a positive action attributed
to her before that negative.

1974
01:20:48,051 --> 01:20:49,710
When you read,
when you read what,

1975
01:20:49,780 --> 01:20:51,300
how they're going to interpret it while
she was there.

1976
01:20:51,301 --> 01:20:52,560
It's always going to be going to be
positive,

1977
01:20:52,561 --> 01:20:55,620
but it's just not going to get fired.
That's oddly positive.

1978
01:20:55,621 --> 01:20:58,740
They're not going to know because
there's a double standard is double

1979
01:20:58,741 --> 01:21:00,990
standard.
And this is what I heard Roseanne when

1980
01:21:00,991 --> 01:21:02,700
she had the number one show in the
country,

1981
01:21:02,701 --> 01:21:05,160
they just threw away a lot of money with
that one.

1982
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:06,390
Yeah.
And also,

1983
01:21:06,420 --> 01:21:10,260
you know,
and did a lot of jobs for people to hook

1984
01:21:10,261 --> 01:21:12,000
it up.
I think she doesn't want to do it

1985
01:21:12,001 --> 01:21:13,470
anymore.
Talking to Roseanne.

1986
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:16,770
Yeah.
Personally I think she was so worn out

1987
01:21:16,950 --> 01:21:17,940
from doing that show.

1988
01:21:17,970 --> 01:21:20,650
She's 66 years old,
you know,

1989
01:21:20,670 --> 01:21:24,810
and she's not in the best of health.
And she told me she got bronchitis doing

1990
01:21:24,811 --> 01:21:26,580
the show and she almost died.
She was like,

1991
01:21:26,581 --> 01:21:29,310
I'm too fucking old for this shit.
I can't do this anyway.

1992
01:21:29,311 --> 01:21:31,980
And they were wearing me out.
I just wish that there was just a little

1993
01:21:31,981 --> 01:21:36,180
more humanity like,
and I'm not saying that it's just like I

1994
01:21:36,181 --> 01:21:40,380
really fundamentally,
strongly dislike something about the

1995
01:21:40,381 --> 01:21:44,490
outrage culture and the willingness to
forego the fact that she's a human being

1996
01:21:44,491 --> 01:21:46,830
and human.
Like there's something about people that

1997
01:21:46,831 --> 01:21:51,450
they believe that human beings are
perfectible and tractable.

1998
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:54,970
I think that this is something that left
has sold the idea that it's predictable,

1999
01:21:54,990 --> 01:21:58,080
that you can defeat racism with the
right person in office.

2000
01:21:58,081 --> 01:21:59,480
That you can like,
you know,

2001
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:00,690
defeat sexism.
Yeah,

2002
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:03,990
you can defeat massage and this is not
possible.

2003
01:22:04,230 --> 01:22:06,870
You can't defeat these things.
Bad things happen because human beings

2004
01:22:06,871 --> 01:22:08,250
are constantly learning.
We're flawed,

2005
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:11,460
but,
but don't you think that ultimately the

2006
01:22:11,461 --> 01:22:14,280
direction that we're all moving in as
human beings,

2007
01:22:14,610 --> 01:22:18,780
if you looked at human beings from 3000
years ago to human beings have today

2008
01:22:19,050 --> 01:22:24,050
we're moving in a general direction of a
much more positive culture

2009
01:22:26,220 --> 01:22:27,900
does to me,
but to me it does.

2010
01:22:27,950 --> 01:22:30,290
Do is negative.
Could both agree,

2011
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:33,030
right?
Can't be depleted,

2012
01:22:33,180 --> 01:22:35,760
but don't you think it can be shunned
out of society?

2013
01:22:35,761 --> 01:22:38,130
Slowly but surely.
If people realize there's repercussions

2014
01:22:38,570 --> 01:22:40,920
for racism,
then you're operating from a fear.

2015
01:22:40,921 --> 01:22:43,020
That doesn't mean that you're not racist
because you're afraid to say it.

2016
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:44,820
No,
but people realize that,

2017
01:22:44,860 --> 01:22:47,730
you know,
it hurts people's feelings and it causes

2018
01:22:47,731 --> 01:22:50,970
all sorts of issues and no,
maybe no human beings,

2019
01:22:50,971 --> 01:22:53,340
especially when they're in.
And I've learned this all the time when

2020
01:22:53,341 --> 01:22:55,200
they were in a spot where they're
fundamentally unhappy.

2021
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:56,830
It's very easy for them to,
to,

2022
01:22:56,920 --> 01:22:57,660
to,
you know,

2023
01:22:57,660 --> 01:23:00,600
lash out.
So if you find someone who's just

2024
01:23:00,601 --> 01:23:01,630
miserable,
right,

2025
01:23:01,830 --> 01:23:02,663
but it doesn't,
you know,

2026
01:23:02,670 --> 01:23:04,560
have,
I dunno the career,

2027
01:23:04,570 --> 01:23:05,800
the girl,
whatever it is,

2028
01:23:05,830 --> 01:23:06,100
that

2029
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:10,960
person is much more likely to say
something that's vitriolic and that's

2030
01:23:10,961 --> 01:23:12,400
just,
that's the human condition.

2031
01:23:12,410 --> 01:23:15,070
Like you're not happy.
So you lash out at someone else.

2032
01:23:15,230 --> 01:23:18,730
I agree with you,
but don't you think that human beings in

2033
01:23:18,731 --> 01:23:22,900
general are less racist today?
Certainly less racist publicly in

2034
01:23:22,901 --> 01:23:25,660
America than 1950.
Oh my gosh,

2035
01:23:25,661 --> 01:23:28,760
yes.
No questions past eight years ago.

2036
01:23:28,761 --> 01:23:30,970
Yeah.
If we go back 68 years ago,

2037
01:23:31,390 --> 01:23:35,170
the world has changed for the better.
Like what love 100 percent in terms of

2038
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:36,970
the social progress progress that we've
made,

2039
01:23:37,150 --> 01:23:39,970
especially in America.
Sixty,

2040
01:23:39,971 --> 01:23:43,540
eight years from now,
we could at least come very close to

2041
01:23:43,541 --> 01:23:45,830
eradicating racism.
Um,

2042
01:23:45,970 --> 01:23:47,860
that's a very good question.
Uh,

2043
01:23:47,861 --> 01:23:50,710
so if you're talking about just America,
yes.

2044
01:23:50,970 --> 01:23:54,070
Well let's just go with America because
it's was just it up because I don't know

2045
01:23:54,071 --> 01:23:57,790
what the fuck's going on.
China or wherever.

2046
01:23:58,300 --> 01:24:02,820
There's some places where racism is just
deep and they accept it.

2047
01:24:03,940 --> 01:24:05,950
That's why I say like racism never go
away,

2048
01:24:05,980 --> 01:24:08,410
but they change it up because then
they'll say Americans are racist towards

2049
01:24:08,411 --> 01:24:09,011
Muslims,
right?

2050
01:24:09,011 --> 01:24:10,420
When you say that you're going to do the
Muslim,

2051
01:24:10,450 --> 01:24:14,470
the Muslim ban from certain countries.
And that's also considered like racism

2052
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:16,600
and not just like,
you know,

2053
01:24:17,860 --> 01:24:19,390
national security,
right?

2054
01:24:19,540 --> 01:24:22,930
So everything sort of becomes racism.
So the problem with racism is nobody

2055
01:24:22,931 --> 01:24:25,510
knows it means anymore.
Everything is racist.

2056
01:24:25,511 --> 01:24:27,520
You can use,
you could the starbucks situation,

2057
01:24:27,521 --> 01:24:29,290
which to me was not racist,
was racist.

2058
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:32,560
That racism,
the starbucks.

2059
01:24:32,590 --> 01:24:35,200
We have to define racism.
You don't think that was racist?

2060
01:24:35,230 --> 01:24:37,090
No,
I don't think that was racist.

2061
01:24:37,091 --> 01:24:37,960
I live in.
I live in.

2062
01:24:37,970 --> 01:24:41,860
So you think if those were white dudes
hanging out in starbucks,

2063
01:24:42,130 --> 01:24:44,530
not buying anything,
just sitting down mind their own

2064
01:24:44,531 --> 01:24:49,180
business that they would have got fucked
with the same exact picture.

2065
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:50,470
So first off,
I live in Philadelphia.

2066
01:24:50,620 --> 01:24:52,840
I'm not kidding.
I wonder if sometimes when I'm there I'm

2067
01:24:52,841 --> 01:24:54,220
like,
I wonder if any white people live here

2068
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:58,270
like Philadelphia is like,
it's 44 percent black,

2069
01:24:58,310 --> 01:25:01,300
not excluding Hispanic,
44 percent black.

2070
01:25:01,301 --> 01:25:03,640
It's unbelievable.
Everyone who works in my build,

2071
01:25:03,650 --> 01:25:05,110
everyone's black.
It's like the weirdest thing.

2072
01:25:05,111 --> 01:25:06,550
I'm like,
this is a very black city,

2073
01:25:06,551 --> 01:25:08,860
right?
So bizarre city to be racist.

2074
01:25:08,861 --> 01:25:11,380
Outright racist in like you're dealing
with black people all day.

2075
01:25:11,740 --> 01:25:14,290
So you remove that and then you think to
me,

2076
01:25:14,291 --> 01:25:15,910
and I've seen this happened tons of
times,

2077
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:19,810
is it possible that this guy was just on
like a power,

2078
01:25:19,860 --> 01:25:22,510
like power trips happen?
I've seen it happen at the most bizarre

2079
01:25:22,511 --> 01:25:23,570
places and I'm like,
all right,

2080
01:25:23,571 --> 01:25:28,571
like at the airport the other day,
like this woman gave me absolute hell at

2081
01:25:28,901 --> 01:25:30,550
Tsa.
I mean it was like I came recap,

2082
01:25:30,700 --> 01:25:31,780
it was just absolute hell.

2083
01:25:32,290 --> 01:25:35,260
I could've walked away and said she was
racist and she randomly selected my bag

2084
01:25:35,261 --> 01:25:37,570
22 times to go through and made me go
through and miss my flight.

2085
01:25:37,571 --> 01:25:40,180
Right.
Or she was having a bad day and she was

2086
01:25:40,181 --> 01:25:41,170
power tripping,
you know?

2087
01:25:41,180 --> 01:25:42,790
And then people have these little
positions.

2088
01:25:42,791 --> 01:25:44,980
It's like that movie where they go door
man,

2089
01:25:44,981 --> 01:25:45,730
you know,
and like,

2090
01:25:45,730 --> 01:25:48,460
and they have these little positions
like the manager of starbucks and you're

2091
01:25:48,461 --> 01:25:51,250
having an off day and these two kids
that could have easily said,

2092
01:25:51,251 --> 01:25:52,150
okay,
I'll buy a cookie.

2093
01:25:52,210 --> 01:25:54,160
Right.
Like common decency by the way.

2094
01:25:54,161 --> 01:25:56,530
Even for me,
if I go use the bathroom at starbucks,

2095
01:25:56,740 --> 01:25:59,910
I'll just fricking buy a cookie or a
little juice box or water.

2096
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:01,090
Just something that makes me feel all
right.

2097
01:26:01,091 --> 01:26:03,800
It's a little more civilized if I just
buy something even though I'm just here

2098
01:26:03,801 --> 01:26:04,010
to use

2099
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:08,510
the bathroom like so on both ends,
pee real bad and there's a line you go

2100
01:26:08,511 --> 01:26:09,470
and then I,
I,

2101
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:11,660
I'll probably spend to the bathroom and
then buy something afterwards.

2102
01:26:11,661 --> 01:26:13,190
I do that.
It was like a natural thing that like,

2103
01:26:13,191 --> 01:26:18,110
it's a little more because of these guys
you could just be a shower and the

2104
01:26:18,111 --> 01:26:22,140
toilet because of outrage culture rich
culture and say like my cousin who is

2105
01:26:22,141 --> 01:26:24,380
half Mexican and black had to go through
this training and she works for

2106
01:26:24,381 --> 01:26:25,214
starbucks.
It's like,

2107
01:26:25,690 --> 01:26:26,660
it's to me,
it's just insane.

2108
01:26:26,661 --> 01:26:28,760
It's like,
is it possible that this guy was power

2109
01:26:28,761 --> 01:26:30,410
tripping?
These kids were being like,

2110
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:32,180
you know,
that could've just bought something and

2111
01:26:32,181 --> 01:26:35,210
it could have been resolved,
but you had two people that are being

2112
01:26:35,211 --> 01:26:37,790
stubborn and,
and taking it to as far as possible,

2113
01:26:37,791 --> 01:26:39,320
you know,
talk about like hall monitor,

2114
01:26:39,410 --> 01:26:41,300
like you know,
these are the rules and it just got too

2115
01:26:41,301 --> 01:26:42,134
far.

2116
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:44,450
That could be a perspective that is
possible.

2117
01:26:44,451 --> 01:26:47,390
But it's also possible that they were
racially selected.

2118
01:26:48,380 --> 01:26:50,060
Yeah.
That's racist.

2119
01:26:50,061 --> 01:26:52,070
And looked at them and they said these
guys are black,

2120
01:26:53,740 --> 01:26:57,460
we don't want them sitting around here
and not buying anything for.

2121
01:26:57,740 --> 01:26:59,720
Could you remind.
Weren't they just waiting for their

2122
01:26:59,721 --> 01:27:04,460
friend to the whole thing didn't make.
How long were they sitting there for 45

2123
01:27:04,461 --> 01:27:06,710
minutes.
But that's like until the cops got

2124
01:27:06,711 --> 01:27:08,210
there,
they probably weren't.

2125
01:27:08,310 --> 01:27:10,040
I mean,
how long does it take to get the cops to

2126
01:27:10,041 --> 01:27:12,210
come and fill it?
Just like if you were sitting there,

2127
01:27:12,220 --> 01:27:13,053
I fill it.
No,

2128
01:27:13,110 --> 01:27:14,890
I don't know.
I've never called the cops and feel it,

2129
01:27:14,900 --> 01:27:18,070
but I do know that like Philly is,
it's just a very,

2130
01:27:18,210 --> 01:27:21,620
it's a very black city.
It's a very black city.

2131
01:27:21,621 --> 01:27:22,970
You know,
I was there with uh,

2132
01:27:23,390 --> 01:27:26,930
Dave Rubin and
Jordan Peterson.

2133
01:27:26,931 --> 01:27:30,600
Peterson opened for them and it's just
stand up,

2134
01:27:31,350 --> 01:27:32,450
stand up,
stand up.

2135
01:27:32,450 --> 01:27:35,030
I'd be good at it.
Come out tonight.

2136
01:27:35,031 --> 01:27:35,864
I'll get,
I'll get you up.

2137
01:27:35,930 --> 01:27:36,763
I'll do it.
Oh wait,

2138
01:27:36,770 --> 01:27:39,650
no I can't because I have A.
I'm going to Wyoming right after this.

2139
01:27:40,390 --> 01:27:42,860
You have any ideas of what you were
talking about if you went on stage?

2140
01:27:43,910 --> 01:27:45,350
I don't know.
I would be really funny though,

2141
01:27:45,351 --> 01:27:49,510
I'm like randomly really funny random
noises that when people pay.

2142
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:50,870
No,
I would be really good,

2143
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:53,540
like really good voices.
Like really good,

2144
01:27:53,780 --> 01:27:56,990
like I'm finding to believe that most
people think they would do really good

2145
01:27:56,991 --> 01:28:00,080
at standing up,
but it's hard because they get nervous.

2146
01:28:00,140 --> 01:28:01,370
Yeah,
I could see that.

2147
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:03,620
It could be just like I'm not funny
anymore.

2148
01:28:04,550 --> 01:28:08,750
I probably would if I was on stage,
I feel like I would be like that like

2149
01:28:08,840 --> 01:28:11,600
stereotypical comedian that just gets
completely sloshed and goes out.

2150
01:28:11,601 --> 01:28:13,810
It's interesting to try to loosen up the
labs.

2151
01:28:14,420 --> 01:28:18,470
I think it's a really hard thing to try
to be funny in front of a sold out room.

2152
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:22,820
I think it's important to be objective
and I think it's important to look at

2153
01:28:22,821 --> 01:28:27,200
something for what it really is and I
think it's highly possible that that

2154
01:28:27,201 --> 01:28:28,990
starbucks thing was racist.
I see.

2155
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,490
I think it's.
I think it's just as.

2156
01:28:31,491 --> 01:28:31,941
Yeah,
like I said,

2157
01:28:31,941 --> 01:28:35,690
it's just as of outweighed culture.
It's here we are.

2158
01:28:35,691 --> 01:28:37,070
It's got.
It's got to be racist.

2159
01:28:37,071 --> 01:28:37,870
It's like,
yes,

2160
01:28:37,870 --> 01:28:40,910
the chances.
I'm just telling you like a lot of black

2161
01:28:40,911 --> 01:28:42,860
people that come in.
I work from the starbucks and reading a

2162
01:28:42,861 --> 01:28:44,300
book.
I work from starbucks all over

2163
01:28:44,301 --> 01:28:45,530
Philadelphia.
That's like what I do.

2164
01:28:45,770 --> 01:28:47,120
Right,
and it's just there's.

2165
01:28:47,180 --> 01:28:48,980
I don't know if there's any white people
in Philadelphia.

2166
01:28:48,981 --> 01:28:53,981
I'm constantly trying to find where,
what area of town where you met?

2167
01:28:54,490 --> 01:28:55,910
Tower theater.
That's where we.

2168
01:28:56,980 --> 01:28:59,480
But they probably commuted.
Oh,

2169
01:28:59,490 --> 01:29:01,470
the fuck drive.

2170
01:29:02,450 --> 01:29:04,230
Yeah.
It's all black people,

2171
01:29:05,370 --> 01:29:07,860
so it's a bizarre place.
Thank you.

2172
01:29:07,861 --> 01:29:08,610
Yeah,
it's rough.

2173
01:29:08,610 --> 01:29:10,740
It's really rough and people don't
understand.

2174
01:29:10,741 --> 01:29:11,191
I'm like,
dude,

2175
01:29:11,191 --> 01:29:13,590
like it's a weird place to come to if
you're racist.

2176
01:29:13,860 --> 01:29:17,340
It's like really hard to be racist and
filled up because everyone's black.

2177
01:29:17,370 --> 01:29:18,080
Like it's like

2178
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:21,290
we went to the movies once and we saw
planet of the apes actually,

2179
01:29:21,291 --> 01:29:25,000
ironically in a really black
neighborhood and then we were.

2180
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:27,860
It was.
I was there for the UFC and it was me

2181
01:29:27,861 --> 01:29:30,690
and my again,
my friend Tommy from Connecticut and we

2182
01:29:30,691 --> 01:29:34,910
were looking for somewhere to go and we
went to this uber black neighborhood and

2183
01:29:34,911 --> 01:29:39,500
it was a fucking blast.
It was hilarious because I never,

2184
01:29:39,501 --> 01:29:41,420
I never go to an all black movie
theaters,

2185
01:29:41,421 --> 01:29:43,610
but they were yelling shit at the
screen.

2186
01:29:43,611 --> 01:29:45,860
I mean,
they became like it was,

2187
01:29:45,930 --> 01:29:48,910
there was the audience that was
entertaining and those,

2188
01:29:48,920 --> 01:29:51,730
a movie and Talese.
There's one scene in the movie where

2189
01:29:51,731 --> 01:29:52,131
the,
you know,

2190
01:29:52,131 --> 01:29:53,810
the planet of the apes kept.
What was the guy's name?

2191
01:29:53,811 --> 01:29:55,310
Caesar got mad.
He's like,

2192
01:29:55,311 --> 01:29:56,144
ah,
you

2193
01:30:01,150 --> 01:30:03,460
barbecued.
We were high out of our mind.

2194
01:30:04,020 --> 01:30:06,120
So the whole thing was like extra
hilarious

2195
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:07,280
black hole.
This is a thing.

2196
01:30:07,281 --> 01:30:09,050
It's in.
So funding is so much of what I do is

2197
01:30:09,051 --> 01:30:11,300
inspired by this.
It's just like people like this,

2198
01:30:12,020 --> 01:30:13,880
I guess presentation of black people in
the media.

2199
01:30:13,881 --> 01:30:17,570
It actually gets me mad because to me,
and I could be biased.

2200
01:30:17,630 --> 01:30:20,330
I think black people are like the most
like funny.

2201
01:30:20,390 --> 01:30:21,920
Like we're so funny,
so endearing.

2202
01:30:21,921 --> 01:30:24,100
Like when I'm around my cousins like I
do,

2203
01:30:24,170 --> 01:30:25,880
there's not a better time that I can
have when I'm around.

2204
01:30:25,881 --> 01:30:27,980
My family were not easily offended.
Right?

2205
01:30:27,981 --> 01:30:30,080
We're constantly being funny.
We tried to making fun of other people.

2206
01:30:30,081 --> 01:30:34,010
Like there's no one meaner.
People are portrayed like victims,

2207
01:30:34,011 --> 01:30:36,350
like everything upsets us.
Like we're just,

2208
01:30:36,351 --> 01:30:40,040
we feel so oppressed and I'm like,
this is not like the black community

2209
01:30:40,041 --> 01:30:42,910
that I grew up in,
in my family and it's also not the,

2210
01:30:43,050 --> 01:30:45,140
the black community,
just like who we celebrate.

2211
01:30:45,140 --> 01:30:47,660
Like I was watching.
Was it Chris rock stand up bigger and

2212
01:30:47,661 --> 01:30:50,840
blacker.
I watched that like from 1994 classic,

2213
01:30:51,230 --> 01:30:55,130
like it is like the stuff that he said
he could never say today,

2214
01:30:55,600 --> 01:31:00,530
just like that is black culture.
He went there on every single race.

2215
01:31:00,590 --> 01:31:03,770
Every single culture made fun of
everybody and it was beautiful.

2216
01:31:03,771 --> 01:31:06,020
It was perfection.
It was a sold out Apollo theater.

2217
01:31:06,170 --> 01:31:08,210
He comes out in.
The first thing he says is like ratio

2218
01:31:08,211 --> 01:31:08,870
was like,
Oh,

2219
01:31:08,870 --> 01:31:11,630
white people in the back today.
You know what I mean?

2220
01:31:11,890 --> 01:31:14,690
And everyone gets up and starts cheering
and they started making fun of black

2221
01:31:14,691 --> 01:31:16,310
people about things that we need to fix.
Right?

2222
01:31:16,311 --> 01:31:17,144
He's using like,
it's,

2223
01:31:17,210 --> 01:31:19,190
he's being funny,
but he's also saying stuff that's real.

2224
01:31:19,191 --> 01:31:22,460
Talking about that baby mama culture and
the difference between like the white

2225
01:31:22,461 --> 01:31:24,230
community starts,
she's talking about school shootings.

2226
01:31:24,260 --> 01:31:26,420
It had just like,
maybe it was columbine that just

2227
01:31:26,430 --> 01:31:29,600
happened and he starts talking about
that and nobody was sensitive.

2228
01:31:29,930 --> 01:31:32,000
Nobody.
Nobody in the audience was going the

2229
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:33,350
way.
You know what I mean?

2230
01:31:33,710 --> 01:31:35,060
It was a different time.

2231
01:31:35,630 --> 01:31:38,180
I missed that time inundated with school
shootings.

2232
01:31:38,181 --> 01:31:40,490
There's so many of them now that people
are just twisted.

2233
01:31:40,770 --> 01:31:42,130
They don't know what to do.
Right.

2234
01:31:42,190 --> 01:31:45,080
So I don't know.
I don't agree with this is the problem

2235
01:31:45,081 --> 01:31:48,890
with when you blame the NRA.
No one in the NRA has ever committed.

2236
01:31:49,250 --> 01:31:50,210
I know it's,
it's insane.

2237
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:50,660
It's,
it's,

2238
01:31:50,660 --> 01:31:52,600
it's,
it's bizarre that people blame them but.

2239
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:52,940
But

2240
01:31:52,940 --> 01:31:56,720
there's an argument that there should be
tighter regulations on people with

2241
01:31:56,721 --> 01:31:59,050
mental illness.
People with the slope.

2242
01:31:59,170 --> 01:32:01,750
Incredibly slippery for that.
It is slippery and it's like it's

2243
01:32:01,751 --> 01:32:03,040
something you can't define.
Like it's,

2244
01:32:03,080 --> 01:32:04,720
it's,
it's too slow mental illness,

2245
01:32:04,810 --> 01:32:05,260
right?
Yeah.

2246
01:32:05,260 --> 01:32:06,760
It's too slippery.
So what does that mean?

2247
01:32:06,761 --> 01:32:08,920
Does that mean if you go to one therapy
session,

2248
01:32:08,970 --> 01:32:12,220
like it is so slippery?
I don't like it.

2249
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:13,030
I,
I,

2250
01:32:13,030 --> 01:32:17,260
it's a dangerous way to go down to
having to be 21 to be able to buy a gun.

2251
01:32:17,350 --> 01:32:19,660
I'm against it because you shouldn't be
able to go get your limbs blown off

2252
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:21,160
overseas.
If you can't come back and defend your

2253
01:32:21,161 --> 01:32:24,280
home totally against it.
That's a good argument that you

2254
01:32:24,281 --> 01:32:26,680
shouldn't be able to go to war if you're
not 21 either,

2255
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:30,160
right?
The frontal cortex isn't developed until

2256
01:32:30,161 --> 01:32:31,930
you're 25 years old,
so who knows?

2257
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:36,580
Who knows when you can make real good
rational decisions for yourself and the

2258
01:32:36,581 --> 01:32:39,700
idea is that if you take a 17 year old
kid fresh out of high school and send

2259
01:32:39,701 --> 01:32:43,060
them overseas and put a gun in his hand,
like he doesn't really know exactly what

2260
01:32:43,061 --> 01:32:46,330
he's doing in the first place because
you're not making informed choices.

2261
01:32:46,331 --> 01:32:49,390
You're just following the lead of the
people that are in command.

2262
01:32:49,391 --> 01:32:51,370
You're hoping that they're telling you
the right thing to do.

2263
01:32:51,490 --> 01:32:53,620
You can get so bizarre to me is that
we're sitting here and we're talking

2264
01:32:53,621 --> 01:32:56,530
about the age,
like as if guns were just created like

2265
01:32:56,531 --> 01:33:00,220
you know when something's wrong,
but what's wrong?

2266
01:33:02,250 --> 01:33:03,730
What do you think is wrong?
Mental Health,

2267
01:33:03,750 --> 01:33:04,930
right?
So I say I,

2268
01:33:04,931 --> 01:33:07,420
I agree with you,
but I think it should the aeration of

2269
01:33:07,421 --> 01:33:10,330
culture altogether.
Like they used to be taught the Bible in

2270
01:33:10,331 --> 01:33:11,150
school.
Like you know,

2271
01:33:11,150 --> 01:33:12,900
people,
people make fun of that now.

2272
01:33:13,050 --> 01:33:15,370
Now we've got this culture where you're
making fun of kids.

2273
01:33:15,371 --> 01:33:17,930
Like religion is like,
we're so far away from religion.

2274
01:33:17,931 --> 01:33:20,380
Like that's like weird to us.
Like you know like teaching religion is

2275
01:33:20,381 --> 01:33:24,040
like it's got like a scarlet letter if
you come in as like a crow holy

2276
01:33:24,041 --> 01:33:26,950
Christian kid and like a normal public
public education thing.

2277
01:33:26,951 --> 01:33:29,800
You've got the family structure where
it's like these kids are running the

2278
01:33:29,801 --> 01:33:32,500
houses these days.
Like I look on facebook and it's like

2279
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:36,070
supposed to be funny when like a four
year old is acting like Cardi b.

2280
01:33:36,070 --> 01:33:37,060
I'm like okay.
Yes.

2281
01:33:37,061 --> 01:33:39,580
It's funny because she's four,
but it's also like not funny because

2282
01:33:39,581 --> 01:33:40,360
she's four right?

2283
01:33:40,360 --> 01:33:41,740
Like,
how do you feel about little tay?

2284
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:47,160
Who's a little tay?
Tay Is this all of out of the news now

2285
01:33:47,951 --> 01:33:52,120
because they found that it's a hustle.
She's a nine year old Asian girl from

2286
01:33:52,121 --> 01:33:53,590
what?
Vancouver is that what's wrong?

2287
01:33:54,070 --> 01:33:57,310
And she talks mad shit,
throws money around calls everybody

2288
01:33:57,311 --> 01:33:59,740
bitches and haters.
That's my point.

2289
01:33:59,741 --> 01:34:01,740
Like this is considered like funny.
It's entertaining.

2290
01:34:01,750 --> 01:34:03,700
Like the fact that and,
and we're okay with that.

2291
01:34:03,701 --> 01:34:06,670
And so parents are pushing their kids to
be more outrageous because there's a way

2292
01:34:06,671 --> 01:34:10,770
that they can make it.
So to me it's like hanging out with Rick

2293
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:14,300
Rubin,
Rubin.

2294
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:15,790
Oh,
she looks like she's.

2295
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,020
She like,
how old is she?

2296
01:34:17,021 --> 01:34:18,830
She looks like she's fingers.
Oh,

2297
01:34:18,831 --> 01:34:21,310
those are hooks.
You should get the horns up and she's

2298
01:34:21,311 --> 01:34:24,340
got a g wagon in front of us.
It's just like the cash me outside girl.

2299
01:34:24,650 --> 01:34:26,770
Right?
So we don't talk about any of that.

2300
01:34:26,771 --> 01:34:29,320
We don't talk about the fact that we no
longer focus on family.

2301
01:34:29,321 --> 01:34:30,970
We know it's no longer focused on
religion.

2302
01:34:30,971 --> 01:34:32,770
Doesn't need to be,
doesn't mean to be that everyone needs

2303
01:34:32,771 --> 01:34:35,260
to be religious about their structure in
religion,

2304
01:34:35,470 --> 01:34:36,430
right there.
Structure in,

2305
01:34:36,431 --> 01:34:39,550
in me when I grew up in and my grandpa
used to make us read the Bible around

2306
01:34:39,551 --> 01:34:41,360
the table,
there was some structure to that and

2307
01:34:41,380 --> 01:34:45,960
lessons and prayers that.
And then there's this mass,

2308
01:34:46,010 --> 01:34:47,500
the facebook,
the snap,

2309
01:34:47,501 --> 01:34:49,550
the snapping,
the instagram,

2310
01:34:49,551 --> 01:34:52,130
the twitter.
It's like we've changed the world and

2311
01:34:52,131 --> 01:34:55,300
expected children to say stay the same
of it and nobody talks about it.

2312
01:34:55,480 --> 01:34:56,980
So is that they say it's the gun's
fault.

2313
01:34:57,230 --> 01:34:58,400
We need to be stricter

2314
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:01,580
gun gun legislation,
but the entire world has shifted.

2315
01:35:01,581 --> 01:35:04,640
We're not talking about those changes.
The dynamic of the world that has

2316
01:35:04,641 --> 01:35:05,880
shifted.
So I,

2317
01:35:05,881 --> 01:35:07,790
I just hold the different position.
I,

2318
01:35:07,791 --> 01:35:09,590
you know,
I think it starts with family.

2319
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:11,810
It starts with structure.
I think we need,

2320
01:35:11,811 --> 01:35:13,910
we need religion back.
I think that that needs to stop being

2321
01:35:13,911 --> 01:35:17,240
such a dirty word and into stopping
mocked roundly by the media.

2322
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:18,800
Like it shouldn't be funny,
you know,

2323
01:35:18,801 --> 01:35:20,030
when joy Behar,
um,

2324
01:35:20,060 --> 01:35:22,610
you know,
says something about Jesus and the whole

2325
01:35:23,330 --> 01:35:25,400
audience giggles.
That's weird.

2326
01:35:25,401 --> 01:35:27,590
She said something about Mike Pence
being mentally ill.

2327
01:35:27,591 --> 01:35:28,850
Yeah,
because he talks to Jesus.

2328
01:35:29,010 --> 01:35:30,470
Think about how weird that is,
right?

2329
01:35:30,471 --> 01:35:34,220
Like how weird that the stuff that we
used to be normal,

2330
01:35:34,221 --> 01:35:35,210
like you know,
praying,

2331
01:35:35,211 --> 01:35:36,560
talking to you.
Just like when I grew up,

2332
01:35:36,561 --> 01:35:38,630
that was like my grandparents'
generation.

2333
01:35:38,631 --> 01:35:42,260
That was everyone was religious and now
we're so far away from that.

2334
01:35:42,620 --> 01:35:43,131
Right?
That,

2335
01:35:43,131 --> 01:35:44,390
that,
that seems like,

2336
01:35:44,820 --> 01:35:47,570
like it's okay to mock and we roundly
market all the time.

2337
01:35:47,930 --> 01:35:51,080
So these,
the structure in the home is,

2338
01:35:51,170 --> 01:35:53,300
in my opinion,
the most important thing that needs to

2339
01:35:53,301 --> 01:35:54,500
change.
The fact that some people are growing up

2340
01:35:54,501 --> 01:35:56,630
without fathers in the home is something
that needs to change.

2341
01:35:56,990 --> 01:35:59,480
Letting your kid have a facebook account
when they're seven.

2342
01:35:59,690 --> 01:36:00,920
Right?
Like just,

2343
01:36:00,980 --> 01:36:03,020
there's just too much.
It's the information age,

2344
01:36:03,021 --> 01:36:04,640
but what information are they
downloading?

2345
01:36:05,480 --> 01:36:07,040
Well,
I definitely think that people need

2346
01:36:07,041 --> 01:36:08,780
structure.
I definitely think that people need

2347
01:36:08,781 --> 01:36:10,760
family and community and all those good
things,

2348
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:13,450
but when it comes to religion it's like,
which one is right?

2349
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:17,040
All of them.
It's not about being right about.

2350
01:36:17,060 --> 01:36:19,190
Yeah,
it doesn't sound like there's not.

2351
01:36:19,210 --> 01:36:22,130
I know I'm going to be honest.
I know nothing about scientology,

2352
01:36:22,131 --> 01:36:24,350
so I'm not.
I know that people hate scientology.

2353
01:36:24,351 --> 01:36:27,980
That's all that all I know about it
created by a science fiction writer and

2354
01:36:27,981 --> 01:36:30,110
it's all nonsense right there.
That's all you needed to know,

2355
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:33,800
so that's one of the dumbest religions
of all time.

2356
01:36:33,801 --> 01:36:36,270
If you read like what they are,
what they stand for,

2357
01:36:37,190 --> 01:36:38,970
Leah Remini,
who was in it for years,

2358
01:36:39,340 --> 01:36:43,040
I didn't watch her series,
she been on my podcast and she explained

2359
01:36:43,100 --> 01:36:46,940
her journey into it and what happened
with it and when she started to question

2360
01:36:46,941 --> 01:36:48,500
it and there's a whole thing.

2361
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:52,730
There is a,
what is the fucking Hbo Documentary?

2362
01:36:52,731 --> 01:36:57,230
It's also the book,
the HBO on Scientology.

2363
01:36:57,280 --> 01:37:00,290
The Lawrence Wright going clear.
Going clear.

2364
01:37:00,380 --> 01:37:02,810
Yeah.
I read the book and I watched the

2365
01:37:02,870 --> 01:37:06,770
documentary so crazy.
I know nothing about it besides like Tom

2366
01:37:06,770 --> 01:37:07,161
Cruise,
I'm going to be like,

2367
01:37:07,161 --> 01:37:08,690
I'm going to be honest with totally
ignorant.

2368
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:10,520
It's,
you know,

2369
01:37:10,970 --> 01:37:12,620
for some people.
Here's the thing,

2370
01:37:12,770 --> 01:37:15,260
for some people its structure and it's
helpful,

2371
01:37:15,290 --> 01:37:18,560
right?
Ideologies are helpful sometimes because

2372
01:37:18,561 --> 01:37:21,980
they give you like a,
like a format to live your life by or

2373
01:37:21,981 --> 01:37:24,040
scaffolding to keep your,
your,

2374
01:37:24,070 --> 01:37:27,500
your moral beliefs inside of these
boundaries and it helps you get ahead

2375
01:37:27,501 --> 01:37:31,880
and you have purpose in decision making,
but at the end of the day it's a cult

2376
01:37:33,020 --> 01:37:35,060
and there's a lot of them,
so a lot of different ones.

2377
01:37:35,061 --> 01:37:37,470
So it's how do you decide?
It's just

2378
01:37:37,470 --> 01:37:41,160
that there's something that comes from.
I think just learning certain lessons.

2379
01:37:41,161 --> 01:37:43,060
It doesn't need to be.
I'm not saying like we all need to like

2380
01:37:43,090 --> 01:37:44,540
structure structure,
like a,

2381
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:48,120
like the Bible used to be taught in
school objectives will be taught by

2382
01:37:48,121 --> 01:37:50,190
people that were not practicing
Christians.

2383
01:37:50,370 --> 01:37:52,300
Right?
I'm used to be taught in school

2384
01:37:52,301 --> 01:37:55,050
objectively because there are still
lessons that are timeless in these

2385
01:37:55,350 --> 01:37:55,980
stories.
Isn't going

2386
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:58,110
to do with whether or not your.
You don't need to then say,

2387
01:37:58,111 --> 01:37:59,340
oh,
and then we go to church and then we

2388
01:37:59,341 --> 01:38:03,060
pray in school and all that stuff.
You can almost extract that and try to

2389
01:38:03,061 --> 01:38:04,330
teach these lessons objective,
Lee,

2390
01:38:04,331 --> 01:38:07,770
but what kids are learning now is like
how to be an anarchistic,

2391
01:38:07,980 --> 01:38:08,341
like,
you know,

2392
01:38:08,341 --> 01:38:10,440
feminism 100,
one and every issue.

2393
01:38:10,490 --> 01:38:14,550
You're like actually fostering an angry
culture by telling them in every term if

2394
01:38:14,551 --> 01:38:16,620
they should be outraged.
We are in outrage culture.

2395
01:38:16,621 --> 01:38:19,320
And then your,
you're surprised when somebody does

2396
01:38:19,321 --> 01:38:21,490
something outrageous.
It,

2397
01:38:21,560 --> 01:38:23,030
it's,
it's a little bizarre to me.

2398
01:38:23,270 --> 01:38:23,841
It's like,
no,

2399
01:38:23,841 --> 01:38:26,420
everything should piss you off.
Everything should make you angry.

2400
01:38:26,630 --> 01:38:29,600
Everything should make you upset.
Everything is as unjust.

2401
01:38:29,601 --> 01:38:32,660
Everything as oppressed.
And I don't know why this kid to shut up

2402
01:38:32,661 --> 01:38:33,860
at school.
I was so angry.

2403
01:38:34,180 --> 01:38:35,360
Like,
it's weird.

2404
01:38:35,361 --> 01:38:37,500
It's like we're weirdly fake.
Uh,

2405
01:38:37,550 --> 01:38:39,810
no one wants to have the conversation in
shooting happens and everyone's to talk

2406
01:38:39,811 --> 01:38:41,930
about the NRA.
And then David Hogg is back on the news.

2407
01:38:43,530 --> 01:38:46,950
Jordan Peterson has some interesting
ideas about religion and the fundamental

2408
01:38:46,951 --> 01:38:51,951
beliefs and the lessons that are learned
from things like the Bible and how they

2409
01:38:53,251 --> 01:38:58,251
apply to human life and that are our own
belief systems.

2410
01:38:59,640 --> 01:39:02,100
Without them,
without these sort of structures and

2411
01:39:02,101 --> 01:39:06,720
belief systems is one of the things that
leads civilization astray and that it's

2412
01:39:06,721 --> 01:39:08,580
done that before and things go awry.

2413
01:39:08,610 --> 01:39:10,740
Well,
I actually had this debate with Charlie

2414
01:39:10,741 --> 01:39:13,830
and I did a panel.
I'm down in DC and we were talking about

2415
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:18,530
whether the reintroduction of God and
teaching them to school and I said like

2416
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:20,490
at some point there seems to be the
struggle.

2417
01:39:20,491 --> 01:39:23,430
I have this idea that like human beings
in a certain way,

2418
01:39:23,431 --> 01:39:25,170
we're doomed to just keep repeating
history.

2419
01:39:25,171 --> 01:39:29,400
I'm obsessed with Greek mythology,
obsessed with like Egyptian history,

2420
01:39:29,401 --> 01:39:31,740
hieroglyphic,
like anything that like or where they

2421
01:39:31,741 --> 01:39:34,050
tell stories,
especially Greek mythology because the

2422
01:39:34,051 --> 01:39:36,450
lessons are there and we just keep doing
it.

2423
01:39:36,451 --> 01:39:37,440
Right?
Greed,

2424
01:39:37,441 --> 01:39:39,090
lust,
like the things that human beings fall

2425
01:39:39,091 --> 01:39:40,020
for.
Right?

2426
01:39:40,050 --> 01:39:42,590
So I had this idea when we were talking
because Charlie is,

2427
01:39:42,591 --> 01:39:45,330
is an evangelical Christian.
I'm not right.

2428
01:39:45,331 --> 01:39:47,670
I believe in I,
I super smart guys.

2429
01:39:47,671 --> 01:39:51,810
And Evangelical Christians believe Jesus
came back to life.

2430
01:39:51,870 --> 01:39:53,190
Yes,
yes.

2431
01:39:53,220 --> 01:39:54,053
He's an avid dog.

2432
01:39:54,300 --> 01:39:58,770
Believes that someone died three years,
three days later they came back to life

2433
01:39:58,830 --> 01:40:00,420
and that they walked on water and

2434
01:40:00,660 --> 01:40:02,700
yeah,
I mean I haven't really gotten into a

2435
01:40:02,701 --> 01:40:04,710
thing because I'm not like,
I'm not the person that should ever be

2436
01:40:04,711 --> 01:40:08,880
like debating or talking about religion.
It's not my shtick I guess.

2437
01:40:09,660 --> 01:40:10,580
But.
So what I,

2438
01:40:10,620 --> 01:40:12,780
what I said to him [inaudible],
me and him both believed that in many

2439
01:40:12,781 --> 01:40:14,950
ways the reason that the government has
a,

2440
01:40:15,090 --> 01:40:17,550
the media has started roundly dissing
God,

2441
01:40:17,610 --> 01:40:18,660
right?
Like in dissing,

2442
01:40:18,910 --> 01:40:20,970
he says Christ is because the government
wants to be God.

2443
01:40:21,420 --> 01:40:22,620
Right?
So if people don't,

2444
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:27,460
the media is responding to the
government's suggestion.

2445
01:40:27,910 --> 01:40:29,130
Is that what you think the reason why

2446
01:40:30,190 --> 01:40:33,760
religion is because the media is
responding to some sort of orders from

2447
01:40:33,761 --> 01:40:35,620
the government.
That's wrong.

2448
01:40:35,650 --> 01:40:37,360
So directive.
No,

2449
01:40:37,361 --> 01:40:38,141
no,
but you know,

2450
01:40:38,141 --> 01:40:41,020
Andrew,
Andrew Breitbart said that politics is

2451
01:40:41,021 --> 01:40:42,460
downstream from culture,
right?

2452
01:40:42,700 --> 01:40:45,310
So,
and you can argue that they feed into

2453
01:40:45,311 --> 01:40:46,180
each other,
whatever it is,

2454
01:40:46,181 --> 01:40:50,560
but there's definitely something between
culture and politics that is linked,

2455
01:40:50,561 --> 01:40:52,100
inextricably linked.
Um,

2456
01:40:52,210 --> 01:40:54,120
so when,
you know,

2457
01:40:55,070 --> 01:40:57,100
when it,
when everyone's on the same page,

2458
01:40:57,101 --> 01:40:58,480
like,
so if the government wants to get

2459
01:40:58,481 --> 01:41:00,130
bigger,
which it has been doing right,

2460
01:41:00,370 --> 01:41:02,320
and wants people to look to them for
answers,

2461
01:41:02,321 --> 01:41:05,830
which it has been doing,
you have to understand they have to sort

2462
01:41:05,831 --> 01:41:09,280
of destroy everything else that they
would potentially be looking to for

2463
01:41:09,281 --> 01:41:10,300
answers,
right?

2464
01:41:10,301 --> 01:41:14,470
So instead of when you're down and out
and people would just go to church and

2465
01:41:14,471 --> 01:41:15,430
pray,
right?

2466
01:41:15,431 --> 01:41:17,890
Or believing in your family or the
family structure,

2467
01:41:18,070 --> 01:41:21,530
they need to know that no matter what
you think the government is the answer

2468
01:41:21,531 --> 01:41:23,200
and that is what a leftist at the end of
the day,

2469
01:41:23,500 --> 01:41:26,920
the left believes the government can fix
all of their problems.

2470
01:41:27,100 --> 01:41:29,920
And uh,
and I find especially when I realized

2471
01:41:29,921 --> 01:41:33,010
that as they do not believe in religion,
like there's just a thing.

2472
01:41:33,011 --> 01:41:33,870
It's a trend.
I've noticed that,

2473
01:41:33,871 --> 01:41:34,810
you know,
I'm not religious,

2474
01:41:34,811 --> 01:41:36,080
I'm not saying that,
you know,

2475
01:41:36,100 --> 01:41:38,980
there's something wrong with it,
but leftists tend to be,

2476
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,170
you know,
really apart from religion.

2477
01:41:41,350 --> 01:41:45,160
So you could make the argument could
definitely be made that the destruction

2478
01:41:45,730 --> 01:41:48,820
of believing in the Bible have stopped
teaching the Bible is because you want

2479
01:41:48,821 --> 01:41:51,240
to make it so that every time you have a
problem then because you're still going

2480
01:41:51,241 --> 01:41:53,110
to our soul,
we need to believe in something.

2481
01:41:53,140 --> 01:41:55,660
We're naturally beings that we need to
believe that something can fix

2482
01:41:55,661 --> 01:41:57,610
something.
I really believe that that is the reason

2483
01:41:57,611 --> 01:41:59,400
why we go get our palms read,
right?

2484
01:41:59,410 --> 01:42:00,730
Like we just like there's something
else.

2485
01:42:00,731 --> 01:42:04,750
Somebody has the answer and people are
starting to believe it's government in

2486
01:42:04,751 --> 01:42:06,490
America and it freaks me out.

2487
01:42:07,460 --> 01:42:11,000
I agree with you that people like
structure and I agree with you that

2488
01:42:11,001 --> 01:42:14,810
people without religion try to find that
structure and those rules and other

2489
01:42:14,811 --> 01:42:16,190
things.
But I don't believe that,

2490
01:42:16,210 --> 01:42:18,740
that this is like some calculated by the
government.

2491
01:42:19,010 --> 01:42:21,920
I think it's human nature thing.
It's human nature.

2492
01:42:22,950 --> 01:42:25,220
It's.
It could be a daddy.

2493
01:42:25,580 --> 01:42:28,700
We want someone to tell us what to do
and if that daddy is the government or

2494
01:42:28,701 --> 01:42:31,280
if that get daddy is aliens,
whatever the fuck it is,

2495
01:42:31,490 --> 01:42:34,880
people need something smarter than
Charlie

2496
01:42:34,970 --> 01:42:35,850
because then he said,
you know,

2497
01:42:36,050 --> 01:42:37,980
we got rid of the guard right now.
We have to go back to religion,

2498
01:42:37,981 --> 01:42:38,701
and then I said,
okay,

2499
01:42:38,701 --> 01:42:40,800
but Charlie,
but then we could actually recreate all

2500
01:42:40,801 --> 01:42:42,870
the terrible stuff that happened with
religion when religion became daddy.

2501
01:42:42,871 --> 01:42:44,850
So we might just be going government,
religion,

2502
01:42:44,970 --> 01:42:45,810
government,
religion,

2503
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:46,561
government,
you know what I mean?

2504
01:42:46,561 --> 01:42:49,110
Just swinging the pendulum corruption in
both.

2505
01:42:49,170 --> 01:42:50,810
Exactly.
And that's my.

2506
01:42:50,850 --> 01:42:52,260
And that's what I believe.
Yeah.

2507
01:42:52,261 --> 01:42:54,900
So I think that we could say that yeah,
we need to start reading using these

2508
01:42:54,901 --> 01:42:56,220
things,
but then we could just end up with the

2509
01:42:56,221 --> 01:42:59,190
extreme again where there's massive
corruption in the church.

2510
01:42:59,191 --> 01:43:01,050
Not everyone's pleased about the
emphasis in the church.

2511
01:43:01,230 --> 01:43:02,190
So then I just said,
wow,

2512
01:43:02,370 --> 01:43:03,203
we're just doomed.

2513
01:43:04,010 --> 01:43:06,380
I think we're doomed.
Mark Twain had a great line.

2514
01:43:06,410 --> 01:43:08,600
History doesn't repeat itself,
but it rhymes.

2515
01:43:09,820 --> 01:43:11,630
Interesting.
Go on.

2516
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:14,900
It's great.
It's great.

2517
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:16,360
Fucker.
Duncan told me that yesterday.

2518
01:43:16,520 --> 01:43:18,520
Yeah,
it often rhymes.

2519
01:43:18,521 --> 01:43:20,630
That's the quote.
I think it repeats itself fully.

2520
01:43:20,970 --> 01:43:22,550
Like we like all of the signs there.
I'm like,

2521
01:43:22,570 --> 01:43:24,730
we could literally just read this all in
a Bible.

2522
01:43:24,731 --> 01:43:27,530
We can read this on Greek mythology and
we know what happens.

2523
01:43:27,531 --> 01:43:30,870
Like it's like it's our humanity and but
there's.

2524
01:43:30,970 --> 01:43:32,080
Is it fixable?
No,

2525
01:43:32,081 --> 01:43:33,810
that's why people think that as a
society perspective,

2526
01:43:33,910 --> 01:43:35,770
of course it's not perfect.
There's going to be great,

2527
01:43:35,771 --> 01:43:36,970
there's going to be less,
there's going to be,

2528
01:43:37,150 --> 01:43:40,510
but now we're in this culture where it's
like he cheated on his wife like,

2529
01:43:40,540 --> 01:43:41,330
oh,
like this.

2530
01:43:41,330 --> 01:43:41,720
Humans

2531
01:43:41,720 --> 01:43:44,930
are different than we used to be and if
we keep moving in this direction,

2532
01:43:44,931 --> 01:43:46,970
we're going to improve.
We're going to continue to improve.

2533
01:43:46,971 --> 01:43:51,830
I think the problems,
thank queen cynical.

2534
01:43:51,950 --> 01:43:52,870
It's not cynical,
it's just,

2535
01:43:52,871 --> 01:43:53,910
it's just,
it's.

2536
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:54,913
There's just always

2537
01:43:55,310 --> 01:43:57,380
lifetime perhaps,
but the idea is that we're moving to a

2538
01:43:57,381 --> 01:43:59,870
greater good.
We're moving towards a greater good that

2539
01:43:59,871 --> 01:44:03,710
some day our children will enjoy and
that we are in a better situation than

2540
01:44:03,711 --> 01:44:06,350
our grandparents were.
Our grandchildren will be in a better

2541
01:44:06,351 --> 01:44:09,590
situation than us and we're constantly
moving towards improvement and this is

2542
01:44:09,591 --> 01:44:14,570
the reason why we're so dissatisfied
with racism and sexism and homophobia

2543
01:44:14,571 --> 01:44:17,870
and hate and all the bullshit that we
see in the world that can be prevented.

2544
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:23,060
We think that if we can shun that and
shame that and push it out of our

2545
01:44:23,061 --> 01:44:27,290
culture that some day in the future
we'll have gotten past this and evolve

2546
01:44:27,291 --> 01:44:32,291
to the point where we as a culture and
we as a civilization will be something

2547
01:44:32,661 --> 01:44:36,530
that we are proud of and we're not proud
of what we are now with school shootings

2548
01:44:36,531 --> 01:44:41,090
and people dependent on Oxycontin's and
seven year olds on facebook and we'll

2549
01:44:41,091 --> 01:44:43,820
take flashing cash in front of a g
wagon.

2550
01:44:43,950 --> 01:44:44,783
There's a.

2551
01:44:45,370 --> 01:44:47,160
that's nothing new.
I want to talk about overmedicating

2552
01:44:47,210 --> 01:44:49,100
children,
like when I was a kid is sick shows

2553
01:44:49,101 --> 01:44:50,990
bouncing off the walls.
We just said you were hyper today.

2554
01:44:50,991 --> 01:44:55,450
It's like give him adderall is.
I literally like ice babysit a kid and

2555
01:44:55,460 --> 01:44:57,770
like the mom would give them adderall.
He was six years old.

2556
01:44:57,970 --> 01:44:58,580
He's like,
oh no.

2557
01:44:58,580 --> 01:45:00,620
What's wrong with him?
Like he might be a kid,

2558
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:01,371
you know,
and,

2559
01:45:01,371 --> 01:45:02,800
and,
and that's another commerce,

2560
01:45:02,810 --> 01:45:03,643
he's got energy,

2561
01:45:03,670 --> 01:45:05,640
don't want to have kids when,
when,

2562
01:45:05,641 --> 01:45:07,390
when kids are going crazy and you're
tired,

2563
01:45:07,391 --> 01:45:08,350
it's fucking hard.
Yeah.

2564
01:45:08,420 --> 01:45:10,490
But you don't medicate them and it's.
And it's bizarre.

2565
01:45:10,491 --> 01:45:11,241
And,
and then they say,

2566
01:45:11,241 --> 01:45:11,810
oh,
well,

2567
01:45:11,810 --> 01:45:12,680
you know,
something's wrong with him.

2568
01:45:12,681 --> 01:45:15,470
He's in school and he and he's not
performing his while he's not paying

2569
01:45:15,471 --> 01:45:17,450
attention.
Maybe he's just not interested.

2570
01:45:18,290 --> 01:45:19,260
Maybe he'd rather be out.

2571
01:45:19,510 --> 01:45:20,940
Oh,
I remember that very well.

2572
01:45:20,941 --> 01:45:22,830
And I remember thinking when I was in
school,

2573
01:45:22,831 --> 01:45:27,831
I am never going to tell my kids that
they have to pay attention to some

2574
01:45:28,381 --> 01:45:29,490
fucking boring shit.

2575
01:45:29,500 --> 01:45:32,020
Right?
Or assume that maybe you want them to

2576
01:45:32,021 --> 01:45:33,550
pay attention,
but I assume that there's something

2577
01:45:33,551 --> 01:45:35,470
wrong with them if they don't is what's
crazy to me.

2578
01:45:35,471 --> 01:45:38,740
They assume there's something wrong with
their child and that they need medicine

2579
01:45:38,920 --> 01:45:42,310
because they're not paying attention to
math problems on the board for an hour.

2580
01:45:42,490 --> 01:45:44,580
That's what scary.
I mean it's like parents are out of

2581
01:45:44,581 --> 01:45:47,170
touch down.
It's the whole thing is unnatural.

2582
01:45:47,910 --> 01:45:49,960
I,
I totally agree with you.

2583
01:45:49,961 --> 01:45:54,490
Like I am like so anti and you see that
like there's this famous kanye quote

2584
01:45:54,730 --> 01:45:56,590
where he says like,
when you see a five year old,

2585
01:45:56,770 --> 01:45:58,510
they have so much energy,
but there's,

2586
01:45:58,511 --> 01:46:01,870
they have so much confidence and so much
passion in everything that they do,

2587
01:46:01,871 --> 01:46:04,780
like they think they can be anything or
they can be a dancer or a singer,

2588
01:46:04,781 --> 01:46:08,080
they'll try to do flips and then go find
like an 11 year old after they've been

2589
01:46:08,081 --> 01:46:09,190
socialized in school.

2590
01:46:09,190 --> 01:46:10,240
They're like the,
the,

2591
01:46:10,250 --> 01:46:12,790
that,
that spark just dies in them and it's

2592
01:46:12,791 --> 01:46:15,310
because they're literally being put
through a system that tells them that

2593
01:46:15,311 --> 01:46:16,180
they can't.
Well,

2594
01:46:16,181 --> 01:46:18,220
this girl got a 90 on a test and you got
an 80,

2595
01:46:18,221 --> 01:46:19,510
so something must be,
you know,

2596
01:46:19,511 --> 01:46:22,240
you're not getting this right.
Well maybe math is just not her thing.

2597
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:23,291
Right?
Maybe she does.

2598
01:46:23,291 --> 01:46:24,490
She does.
And she's not as good at math as

2599
01:46:24,491 --> 01:46:27,550
somebody else.
I think everybody has their own pieces

2600
01:46:27,551 --> 01:46:31,180
of brilliant and that the current
education system does not foster to

2601
01:46:31,181 --> 01:46:33,730
those individually to individualism.
They're actually trying to create a

2602
01:46:33,731 --> 01:46:36,010
collectivist society by being able to
measure.

2603
01:46:36,310 --> 01:46:39,070
You know,
I'm a kids brilliance by standardized

2604
01:46:39,071 --> 01:46:40,990
testing something.
Charlie and I very much agree.

2605
01:46:41,310 --> 01:46:43,320
Yeah.
I don't think they're necessarily doing

2606
01:46:43,321 --> 01:46:45,060
that,
but what they are is uninspired and

2607
01:46:45,061 --> 01:46:48,800
underpaid and they're boring and kids go
to their classes and their board or

2608
01:46:48,801 --> 01:46:50,010
their mind,
they have to get

2609
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:51,540
this stupid grade so they can keep
going.

2610
01:46:51,541 --> 01:46:53,610
Me,
I was so bored.

2611
01:46:53,611 --> 01:46:56,940
I was those personality to your.
You got a lot of energy.

2612
01:46:56,941 --> 01:46:59,640
I would imagine you sitting.
What am I just always felt like they

2613
01:46:59,641 --> 01:47:01,000
were stupid.
Like,

2614
01:47:01,010 --> 01:47:01,480
you know,
I'm like,

2615
01:47:01,480 --> 01:47:03,320
is this teacher even like smarter than
that?

2616
01:47:03,321 --> 01:47:06,210
Can we take a test?
Like a just like a quick Iq test to see

2617
01:47:06,211 --> 01:47:09,030
if I should even have to take a class
from someone who's actually dumber than

2618
01:47:09,031 --> 01:47:12,120
me and we're having those thoughts like
in high school just being like just

2619
01:47:12,121 --> 01:47:14,820
aren't even smart sometimes,
like they're not alone.

2620
01:47:15,460 --> 01:47:19,170
Good news is that from that you get this
dissatisfaction,

2621
01:47:19,171 --> 01:47:23,850
this feeling of just not not wanting to
be a part of this anymore and then you

2622
01:47:23,851 --> 01:47:25,560
start seeking other ways to make a
living.

2623
01:47:25,570 --> 01:47:27,470
Other ways to get mean.
Let me see.

2624
01:47:27,660 --> 01:47:30,930
I got on Youtube and I started talking
about stuff and people responded to it.

2625
01:47:31,260 --> 01:47:34,590
And so how did you go?
Full blown conservative?

2626
01:47:34,720 --> 01:47:36,220
I'm a human.
The White House.

2627
01:47:36,240 --> 01:47:36,860
Yes,
I have.

2628
01:47:36,860 --> 01:47:38,010
Oh fuck.
Have you been in the White House?

2629
01:47:38,011 --> 01:47:40,260
You're a conservative for two years.
Two years ago.

2630
01:47:40,261 --> 01:47:42,540
This is why some concern talking shit
online.

2631
01:47:43,080 --> 01:47:45,270
I'm telling you,
it's because you're like a conservative,

2632
01:47:45,271 --> 01:47:46,104
wet dream.

2633
01:47:48,010 --> 01:47:49,490
A little bit of jealousy.
But I'm like,

2634
01:47:49,491 --> 01:47:50,720
I'm like,
this is.

2635
01:47:50,730 --> 01:47:54,870
But this is like,
I believe in this so much that I wish we

2636
01:47:54,871 --> 01:47:56,250
could stop that because like,
I'm like,

2637
01:47:56,251 --> 01:47:57,510
no,
let's change the paradigm.

2638
01:47:57,760 --> 01:48:00,600
Like let's get trump to do the,
like the Joe Rogan show as opposed to

2639
01:48:00,601 --> 01:48:01,351
saying,
you know what I mean,

2640
01:48:01,351 --> 01:48:03,180
like there's.
But people don't see things that way.

2641
01:48:03,181 --> 01:48:03,931
It's all about me,
me,

2642
01:48:03,931 --> 01:48:05,070
me,
the ego comes out,

2643
01:48:05,071 --> 01:48:05,940
you know?
So.

2644
01:48:05,941 --> 01:48:06,571
But anyways,
um,

2645
01:48:06,571 --> 01:48:07,770
so I,
I met Charlie,

2646
01:48:07,771 --> 01:48:09,880
that was a huge thing that happened.
Um,

2647
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:12,260
I was speaking at the David Horowitz
Freedom Center.

2648
01:48:12,420 --> 01:48:14,450
Charlie's 24.
You could ask why he's flying around

2649
01:48:14,460 --> 01:48:16,080
with the first family too,
but when you meet them,

2650
01:48:16,081 --> 01:48:17,940
you understand he's just absolutely
brilliant.

2651
01:48:18,300 --> 01:48:19,920
Um,
and uh,

2652
01:48:19,921 --> 01:48:21,930
we just wanted to do this together.
I met him and I said,

2653
01:48:21,931 --> 01:48:23,460
look,
I think that there needs to be a black

2654
01:48:23,461 --> 01:48:25,140
revolution against the Democratic Party.

2655
01:48:25,230 --> 01:48:27,330
I think I'm the person to lead it.
Like I'm your girl.

2656
01:48:27,570 --> 01:48:32,570
And I was speaking on a panel with Dave
Rubin about why I left the left and what

2657
01:48:33,751 --> 01:48:37,590
I understood about the left and he hired
me on the spot and the rest is sort of

2658
01:48:37,591 --> 01:48:38,424
history,
you know?

2659
01:48:38,460 --> 01:48:39,500
I mean,
that's really it.

2660
01:48:39,510 --> 01:48:41,460
I worked,
I worked my ass off.

2661
01:48:41,461 --> 01:48:43,200
The one who hired you,
who?

2662
01:48:43,350 --> 01:48:45,590
Charlie Kirk.
He actually runs turning point USA.

2663
01:48:45,720 --> 01:48:46,800
I know.
He's like so young.

2664
01:48:46,801 --> 01:48:50,060
It's insane.
And you should look him up and figuring

2665
01:48:50,061 --> 01:48:51,900
out who he is because he's,
in my opinion,

2666
01:48:51,901 --> 01:48:53,270
he's going to be a future present.
United States.

2667
01:48:53,271 --> 01:48:56,970
And everyone says that everyone who
every show is bound and Fox as like very

2668
01:48:56,971 --> 01:48:58,620
rarely do you meet,
like rush limbaugh just said,

2669
01:48:58,621 --> 01:49:01,020
very rarely do you meet someone and
think that's going to be a president of

2670
01:49:01,021 --> 01:49:04,860
United States.
Try the is probably on like 18 different

2671
01:49:04,861 --> 01:49:06,930
kinds of pills.
And I know he said it's,

2672
01:49:06,940 --> 01:49:08,800
it's so many times.
Yeah.

2673
01:49:11,220 --> 01:49:12,053
But yeah,
he's

2674
01:49:13,560 --> 01:49:15,630
clean now.
I didn't even know that he was not

2675
01:49:15,631 --> 01:49:17,340
clean.
Took 100 pills a day.

2676
01:49:17,610 --> 01:49:21,600
That's scary to me.
And from taking pills,

2677
01:49:21,760 --> 01:49:25,950
you understand this.
I won't even take tylenol.

2678
01:49:25,980 --> 01:49:28,230
I don't even like.
I'm just like told me that by the way.

2679
01:49:28,540 --> 01:49:30,510
Very Fair.
Fair warning.

2680
01:49:30,600 --> 01:49:32,160
Alex Jones,
he explained to me,

2681
01:49:32,510 --> 01:49:35,580
he explained to me the mechanism of rush
limbaugh going deaf and taking pills.

2682
01:49:35,581 --> 01:49:36,750
So rush,
if I'm wrong,

2683
01:49:36,751 --> 01:49:38,220
I'm sorry.
I,

2684
01:49:38,221 --> 01:49:41,520
I have no idea if that's true.
It's true.

2685
01:49:41,990 --> 01:49:46,920
As long as we can from taking pills.
Gone almost never lies.

2686
01:49:46,930 --> 01:49:48,130
Look up mine.
Exactly.

2687
01:49:48,131 --> 01:49:52,360
Me and Brian Cowen or we're brothers and
sisters something.

2688
01:49:53,320 --> 01:49:54,250
But yeah.
So I just,

2689
01:49:54,251 --> 01:49:54,821
I,
I just,

2690
01:49:54,821 --> 01:49:58,240
I've worked incredibly hard.
I feel like I haven't slept since last

2691
01:49:58,240 --> 01:49:59,051
year.
I'm traveling.

2692
01:49:59,051 --> 01:50:03,430
I mean I flew like a politician,
but not all policies.

2693
01:50:03,580 --> 01:50:04,900
People ask me,
they're like,

2694
01:50:04,970 --> 01:50:05,740
candice,
what do you like?

2695
01:50:05,740 --> 01:50:06,670
What are you going to do?
I'm like,

2696
01:50:06,700 --> 01:50:08,920
I'm not a.
I'm just a girl who talks about stuff

2697
01:50:08,921 --> 01:50:12,550
that I believe in and people view me as
a politician.

2698
01:50:12,551 --> 01:50:14,190
I don't.
I don't understand pills though.

2699
01:50:14,470 --> 01:50:15,670
You pull that article.
I'm sorry.

2700
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:18,040
I didn't mean to interrupt you.
The article on the screen.

2701
01:50:18,240 --> 01:50:19,073
Why?
Why?

2702
01:50:19,210 --> 01:50:20,390
What about me?
Seems like a Paul.

2703
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:23,590
This is what I don't get a little bit
polished.

2704
01:50:23,650 --> 01:50:27,890
You've got a little bit of a sort of a
plant.

2705
01:50:28,120 --> 01:50:31,300
You said these things before.
A lot of the things you're saying,

2706
01:50:31,320 --> 01:50:35,710
you're very good at it.
You've got a well oiled path.

2707
01:50:35,950 --> 01:50:38,330
There's a nice groove in your brain.
Well,

2708
01:50:38,331 --> 01:50:41,020
you know how to say these things and
then occasionally pop out of it and you

2709
01:50:41,021 --> 01:50:43,280
just play in Kansas,
but you know when you're like,

2710
01:50:43,300 --> 01:50:45,270
I'm going to leave black America.
I'm going to go against the Democrats.

2711
01:50:45,810 --> 01:50:47,620
I believe.
I believe you believe,

2712
01:50:48,240 --> 01:50:50,410
believe you said it many,
many times,

2713
01:50:50,980 --> 01:50:52,450
but I just said to you,
I told you,

2714
01:50:52,460 --> 01:50:55,150
I told this in November.
It was my plan,

2715
01:50:55,330 --> 01:50:57,580
so I'm just a person that's going after
my goal and then as I started

2716
01:50:57,581 --> 01:51:00,010
accomplishing it,
people are just like throwing shade and

2717
01:51:00,011 --> 01:51:00,611
he,
and I'm like,

2718
01:51:00,611 --> 01:51:02,400
dude,
like now it's turned into like,

2719
01:51:02,500 --> 01:51:05,620
what has been the shade and the hate
that you think is unwarranted?

2720
01:51:06,420 --> 01:51:07,030
One?
Well,

2721
01:51:07,030 --> 01:51:09,460
first off,
let's not pretend like we can talk about

2722
01:51:09,461 --> 01:51:13,240
social justice warriors on the left.
We have them on the right to,

2723
01:51:13,241 --> 01:51:16,390
let's not pretend we don't have the
people that like they can't.

2724
01:51:16,420 --> 01:51:19,420
Like as soon as I got to a 100,000
youtube followers every youtube or

2725
01:51:19,421 --> 01:51:21,880
suddenly it was like,
who is this deep dive?

2726
01:51:22,030 --> 01:51:23,520
And then they came with the like she
was,

2727
01:51:23,650 --> 01:51:24,180
she,
uh,

2728
01:51:24,180 --> 01:51:25,013
she,
she,

2729
01:51:25,150 --> 01:51:28,010
she,
she created because she wanted to doc

2730
01:51:28,040 --> 01:51:28,420
smile.

2731
01:51:28,420 --> 01:51:30,790
The most bizarre I have youtube or
looking up like,

2732
01:51:31,050 --> 01:51:34,000
has she ever dated a black guy?
Like the most absurd.

2733
01:51:34,090 --> 01:51:35,260
I'm like,
what are you guys doing?

2734
01:51:35,261 --> 01:51:38,420
Like can we just all like just
peacefully coexist like this?

2735
01:51:38,670 --> 01:51:43,670
What would it be conservative that I'm
not asking you.

2736
01:51:44,111 --> 01:51:46,420
I'm just saying like what would it be?
The issue will be the article.

2737
01:51:46,421 --> 01:51:46,901
I know.
I'm like,

2738
01:51:46,901 --> 01:51:49,750
what is the article going to be here?
The same boyfriend from high school and

2739
01:51:49,751 --> 01:51:51,010
he happened to be white,
but that'd be problem.

2740
01:51:51,180 --> 01:51:54,070
It wouldn't be a big part would be an
article that's for sure 100 percent,

2741
01:51:54,071 --> 01:51:56,290
but they just started digging in and I'm
just like,

2742
01:51:56,320 --> 01:51:57,970
guys,
I'm just working hard and if you want to

2743
01:51:57,971 --> 01:52:00,490
know what my strategy is,
I don't make videos about you guys.

2744
01:52:00,690 --> 01:52:02,140
I,
I make these not what I care about.

2745
01:52:02,141 --> 01:52:03,670
I have a brand and define my brand.

2746
01:52:03,670 --> 01:52:06,430
Your brand is just going after people
and that's not,

2747
01:52:06,431 --> 01:52:09,070
that's not a brand at all.
That's a weird thing on youtube where

2748
01:52:09,190 --> 01:52:11,920
you have these little communities,
they attack each other in the

2749
01:52:11,921 --> 01:52:14,950
communities.
Have you ever seen the Vegan hate videos

2750
01:52:14,951 --> 01:52:16,920
where they go after it,
but I got,

2751
01:52:17,090 --> 01:52:18,400
it was like banana.
What's it?

2752
01:52:18,401 --> 01:52:21,670
Banana girl
freely or something?

2753
01:52:21,671 --> 01:52:22,320
Yeah,
I've heard about.

2754
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:25,320
I've heard about it,
but I didn't say call youtube like

2755
01:52:25,330 --> 01:52:27,640
youtube high,
like it's like I and I was like the new

2756
01:52:27,641 --> 01:52:29,320
girl who showed up,
but there are like 40.

2757
01:52:29,400 --> 01:52:30,360
Yeah,
I mean I know that's what's weird,

2758
01:52:30,361 --> 01:52:32,140
but like I was like the new girl who
showed up and like,

2759
01:52:32,230 --> 01:52:34,660
like
cheerleader.

2760
01:52:34,661 --> 01:52:36,190
Yeah.
I like the captain of the cheerleading

2761
01:52:36,191 --> 01:52:37,024
team.
All of a sudden

2762
01:52:38,860 --> 01:52:39,900
they were like,
no,

2763
01:52:41,470 --> 01:52:42,430
hate me.
They hate me.

2764
01:52:43,070 --> 01:52:45,040
Was like,
I don't want to be a youtuber.

2765
01:52:45,260 --> 01:52:46,040
I just plugged my

2766
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:49,160
content on youtube and then I really
hate me.

2767
01:52:50,690 --> 01:52:52,460
That's bizarre.
That's just like totally weird.

2768
01:52:52,461 --> 01:52:55,150
But it's fine because I never ran into
them because they don't have like,

2769
01:52:55,160 --> 01:52:58,040
there's no brand here.
I really don't think they go outside,

2770
01:52:58,041 --> 01:53:00,650
but there's no brand if you don't see,
they run,

2771
01:53:00,680 --> 01:53:05,150
run back inside and make another huge.
That's bizarre.

2772
01:53:05,240 --> 01:53:06,470
Youtube,
there's youtube high.

2773
01:53:06,590 --> 01:53:08,480
Then you have what I call game of
conservatives.

2774
01:53:08,650 --> 01:53:09,560
Just like didn't,
didn't,

2775
01:53:09,561 --> 01:53:11,720
didn't it?
Did it like they're all like racing for

2776
01:53:11,721 --> 01:53:14,900
the throne and I thought,
I'm like guys like there's like white

2777
01:53:14,901 --> 01:53:16,100
walkers at the wall.
Like,

2778
01:53:16,130 --> 01:53:17,930
you know,
the glove is trying to like turn this

2779
01:53:17,931 --> 01:53:20,600
into comedy so America can we not
compete for the egos.

2780
01:53:20,601 --> 01:53:24,390
That's like it's helping to save
America.

2781
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:27,680
I genuinely believe that,
like right now is the only time that we

2782
01:53:27,681 --> 01:53:28,640
have to save this country.

2783
01:53:28,640 --> 01:53:30,520
I genuinely believe that.
Like we're at the.

2784
01:53:31,230 --> 01:53:34,220
I think if Donald Trump did not win the
election,

2785
01:53:34,250 --> 01:53:37,760
we would've lost America.
I genuinely like Hillary,

2786
01:53:37,761 --> 01:53:40,670
the global initiative.
Just this like the.

2787
01:53:40,671 --> 01:53:43,490
I like,
they were like communist to me.

2788
01:53:43,491 --> 01:53:44,960
I'm,
I really believe that this is an

2789
01:53:44,961 --> 01:53:47,450
opportunity to sort of like,
we're like the last stand for Western

2790
01:53:47,451 --> 01:53:48,740
civilization.
Look what's going on in Europe.

2791
01:53:48,950 --> 01:53:51,320
It's like insane and people don't
understand that.

2792
01:53:51,321 --> 01:53:53,000
I'm like,
what is going on in Europe right now?

2793
01:53:53,010 --> 01:53:55,640
It's like Europe's done.
Like she want you to watch the video.

2794
01:53:55,641 --> 01:53:59,510
Like Europe has committed suicide or
whatever it was called Douglas Murray on

2795
01:53:59,511 --> 01:54:01,700
the podcast.
He was trying to explain to me his book

2796
01:54:01,720 --> 01:54:03,950
a strange death of Europe.
Oh,

2797
01:54:03,960 --> 01:54:05,070
I,
I think he did a prayer.

2798
01:54:05,071 --> 01:54:07,240
You video on that too.
It's,

2799
01:54:07,310 --> 01:54:10,370
it's real.
Like they've lost Europe and the last

2800
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:13,400
stand for resin civilization is America
and then you have people that are

2801
01:54:13,401 --> 01:54:14,330
competing for Egos.

2802
01:54:14,330 --> 01:54:14,990
I'm like guys,
no.

2803
01:54:14,990 --> 01:54:19,700
Like there's white walkers at the point.
I don't understand how you think that we

2804
01:54:20,590 --> 01:54:23,880
were almost losing America and there's a
battle for America.

2805
01:54:23,900 --> 01:54:28,900
I really feel that like just in in every
regard in terms of just just the people

2806
01:54:29,691 --> 01:54:32,570
that were running like Hillary Clinton,
like this woman was a globalist.

2807
01:54:32,610 --> 01:54:35,780
Like just think about who we were,
who we were in bed with like Saudi

2808
01:54:35,780 --> 01:54:37,550
Arabia selling all of our uranium to
Russia.

2809
01:54:37,670 --> 01:54:40,040
Like trump came in and was like,
no,

2810
01:54:40,041 --> 01:54:42,170
like America people.
We weren't the gap.

2811
01:54:42,171 --> 01:54:43,850
Like we lost them.
We're losing the middle class.

2812
01:54:43,851 --> 01:54:47,860
That gap between the rich and the poor
was like literally causing that.

2813
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:52,220
A policy's shipping all of our jobs
overseas.

2814
01:54:52,310 --> 01:54:53,960
The regulation,
the government getting bigger and

2815
01:54:53,961 --> 01:54:55,820
better.
You can't do anything as an entrepreneur

2816
01:54:55,910 --> 01:54:57,980
entrepreneur in America without a piece
of paper from the government,

2817
01:54:58,160 --> 01:55:00,110
discouraging people with this piece of
paper,

2818
01:55:00,160 --> 01:55:02,780
like sending,
like shutting down the factories from

2819
01:55:02,781 --> 01:55:03,200
getting that.

2820
01:55:03,200 --> 01:55:05,870
There's something,
there's a little land between New York

2821
01:55:05,871 --> 01:55:06,890
and La,
believe it or not,

2822
01:55:06,891 --> 01:55:07,400
like,
you know,

2823
01:55:07,400 --> 01:55:10,480
and this is what trump understood.
We were losing that and,

2824
01:55:10,481 --> 01:55:12,260
and trump appealed to that.
Those people.

2825
01:55:12,261 --> 01:55:15,440
I'm still floored,
like as I'm traveling the world and

2826
01:55:15,441 --> 01:55:19,310
seeing different pieces of the country,
I'm learning how ignorant I was like,

2827
01:55:19,311 --> 01:55:21,050
and that's the best thing in the entire
world.

2828
01:55:21,400 --> 01:55:25,010
Just I fell victim to the idea that like
it was progress,

2829
01:55:25,011 --> 01:55:26,330
it was progress,
it was progress.

2830
01:55:26,480 --> 01:55:29,360
We have to care about the environment.
It was progress and it's like no,

2831
01:55:29,361 --> 01:55:32,630
like we've been losing.
America has been losing and Donald Trump

2832
01:55:32,631 --> 01:55:34,940
understood that in a way that I didn't
end.

2833
01:55:35,150 --> 01:55:37,130
I thought we have to care about the
environment.

2834
01:55:38,050 --> 01:55:40,450
Not even a little bit,
not even a little bit,

2835
01:55:40,520 --> 01:55:41,390
no.
Okay.

2836
01:55:41,391 --> 01:55:42,710
Let me,
let me clarify this.

2837
01:55:42,800 --> 01:55:44,340
I don't throw trash on the ground.

2838
01:55:44,400 --> 01:55:46,590
Like I'm not saying like we need to
like,

2839
01:55:46,850 --> 01:55:48,460
you know,
trash the environment like,

2840
01:55:48,740 --> 01:55:51,050
but do I believe in climate change?
No.

2841
01:55:51,530 --> 01:55:54,690
Don't believe in climate change.
I think the climate always changes,

2842
01:55:54,691 --> 01:55:56,610
I guess is what I should do.
I believe that this is like,

2843
01:55:56,810 --> 01:55:57,810
you know,
an issue that,

2844
01:55:57,900 --> 01:56:00,690
um,
is being that is fatal global warming,

2845
01:56:00,691 --> 01:56:02,670
which they've changed conveniently.
They got rid of the word one.

2846
01:56:02,671 --> 01:56:05,850
Scientists started disproving it.
Now they only say client climate change.

2847
01:56:06,230 --> 01:56:07,090
Um,
no,

2848
01:56:07,160 --> 01:56:08,370
I,
I think that that was just a way to

2849
01:56:08,371 --> 01:56:10,980
extract dollars from Americans.
I don't at all believe they had no

2850
01:56:10,981 --> 01:56:12,870
actionable plan.
It was great for trump to gather that

2851
01:56:12,871 --> 01:56:13,740
deal.
It was terrible.

2852
01:56:13,840 --> 01:56:17,130
Okay.
But this is an incredibly complicated

2853
01:56:17,131 --> 01:56:18,080
subject,
right?

2854
01:56:18,440 --> 01:56:22,530
You would have to talk to a bunch of
different scientists and see how they

2855
01:56:22,531 --> 01:56:26,040
gathered data and see what they
understand about co two levels and

2856
01:56:26,041 --> 01:56:29,230
what's the danger of that and what can
combat it and what could not.

2857
01:56:29,580 --> 01:56:34,580
Have you done all this flipping opinion?
This is not.

2858
01:56:34,650 --> 01:56:36,300
This wouldn't be the hill I died on.
Right.

2859
01:56:36,301 --> 01:56:37,770
But it's not about part.
I just genuinely,

2860
01:56:37,771 --> 01:56:40,200
I've read a ton about it,
but I would not be able to.

2861
01:56:40,201 --> 01:56:41,610
I would not be able to come to you and
say like,

2862
01:56:41,790 --> 01:56:44,250
this is my strong opinion,
but here's like the easiest way to say

2863
01:56:44,251 --> 01:56:45,084
this,
right?

2864
01:56:45,120 --> 01:56:47,640
The fact that there is a disparity in
the science committee about whether or

2865
01:56:47,641 --> 01:56:49,650
not it's real,
it's enough to very little,

2866
01:56:49,790 --> 01:56:51,390
very little disparity.
Most,

2867
01:56:51,410 --> 01:56:53,340
most,
most scientists,

2868
01:56:53,460 --> 01:56:58,460
most the vast majority agree that human
beings are negatively affecting climate

2869
01:56:59,341 --> 01:57:01,530
change.
The vast majority.

2870
01:57:02,580 --> 01:57:03,270
Yeah.
I don't,

2871
01:57:03,270 --> 01:57:04,500
I just,
I just don't think so.

2872
01:57:04,920 --> 01:57:08,280
So you think that the very few
scientists that disagree with the

2873
01:57:08,281 --> 01:57:10,380
consensus or the ones that are correct?
Well,

2874
01:57:10,381 --> 01:57:14,130
I think if something is it,
it's either subjective or objective and

2875
01:57:14,160 --> 01:57:15,360
their objective truths.

2876
01:57:15,360 --> 01:57:16,710
Right?
But it's subjective.

2877
01:57:16,711 --> 01:57:19,050
If you're saying that there are some.
I don't think there's very little.

2878
01:57:19,080 --> 01:57:21,870
There are some that don't get paid to go
on tv then some of their are not bill

2879
01:57:21,871 --> 01:57:24,730
Nye who are not funded scientists.
Um,

2880
01:57:24,740 --> 01:57:27,120
and,
and that has been a whole world not

2881
01:57:27,121 --> 01:57:31,780
assigned.
It's just not my heart when science

2882
01:57:32,030 --> 01:57:33,660
piece,
but that's the,

2883
01:57:33,780 --> 01:57:37,330
that's the point.
Now that's not a good word to

2884
01:57:37,420 --> 01:57:40,800
scientists,
but bill Nye is like a science

2885
01:57:40,890 --> 01:57:44,090
influencer or a science entertainer.
He's like,

2886
01:57:44,240 --> 01:57:46,770
he doesn't have a background in actual
science.

2887
01:57:46,771 --> 01:57:49,900
He's not a scientist,
doesn't have a phd in science.

2888
01:57:50,360 --> 01:57:55,200
How to do with he promotes science.
Science is not bad,

2889
01:57:55,201 --> 01:58:00,201
but the real problem is with climate
change is that would for sure there has

2890
01:58:01,381 --> 01:58:04,350
been ups and downs throughout the
history of this planet.

2891
01:58:04,351 --> 01:58:05,710
They're observable.
They've.

2892
01:58:05,780 --> 01:58:08,670
They followed them in.
We was one of the subjects that I had

2893
01:58:08,671 --> 01:58:12,540
earlier today with a Dr Robert Schoch in
2014.

2894
01:58:12,540 --> 01:58:15,750
The vast majority,
87 percent of scientists said that human

2895
01:58:15,751 --> 01:58:20,190
activity is driving global warming.
Yet only half the American public public

2896
01:58:20,191 --> 01:58:22,080
ascribe to that view.
So what website?

2897
01:58:22,110 --> 01:58:26,780
80 seven percent.
And this is scientific American though,

2898
01:58:26,960 --> 01:58:29,880
like that means it's making money.
I don't trust that.

2899
01:58:29,881 --> 01:58:31,530
If it was a.org,
I would probably take that,

2900
01:58:31,531 --> 01:58:35,160
but that this is just a random website
and scientific American is not

2901
01:58:35,250 --> 01:58:37,570
necessarily a random website.
I don't.

2902
01:58:37,680 --> 01:58:39,780
I don't believe this like at all.
Just so you know,

2903
01:58:40,430 --> 01:58:43,630
you don't believe it.
Like I genuinely.

2904
01:58:43,631 --> 01:58:46,420
I genuinely don't believe I know you do,
but I genuinely don't believe it.

2905
01:58:46,480 --> 01:58:51,480
I believe first time the consensus of
scientists that are studying the data

2906
01:58:52,060 --> 01:58:54,910
and so what they're doing is studying
all of the stories that came out about

2907
01:58:54,911 --> 01:58:57,760
the scientist that said that when they
tried to present their evidence to show

2908
01:58:57,761 --> 01:59:00,100
like they were basically just getting
shut down at every corner,

2909
01:59:00,460 --> 01:59:02,680
you can pull that up to like scientists
who look up,

2910
01:59:02,750 --> 01:59:03,880
I guess look up the opposite.

2911
01:59:04,210 --> 01:59:05,550
Right?
So instead of instead of looking for,

2912
01:59:05,560 --> 01:59:07,390
you're searching for,
looking for what you're not looking for.

2913
01:59:07,640 --> 01:59:10,290
I didn't search for it.
That's what I found when I searched it.

2914
01:59:10,810 --> 01:59:12,460
Sorry.
But yeah,

2915
01:59:12,490 --> 01:59:15,400
look up is my question.
Why are you so sure.

2916
01:59:15,401 --> 01:59:20,320
This is a
complicated subject and it is,

2917
01:59:20,330 --> 01:59:24,970
and I said I am not so sure that I would
die on the hill for it.

2918
01:59:25,360 --> 01:59:28,990
My opinion right now,
and it's just that it was a means,

2919
01:59:28,991 --> 01:59:31,840
because forget the fact of whether you
believe global warming is real.

2920
01:59:31,850 --> 01:59:33,820
Let's say it's 100 percent real estate.
We know for fact that trail.

2921
01:59:34,150 --> 01:59:39,150
Is there a way clear global warming,
global climate change is definitely

2922
01:59:39,281 --> 01:59:40,630
real.
It's happening.

2923
01:59:41,450 --> 01:59:42,530
It's happened,
yes.

2924
01:59:42,640 --> 01:59:44,080
It has always had what?
What are we?

2925
01:59:44,081 --> 01:59:45,820
What is the climate change?
Yes.

2926
01:59:45,821 --> 01:59:47,740
The climate changes.
It was different weather yesterday than

2927
01:59:47,741 --> 01:59:48,574
it was today.

2928
01:59:48,580 --> 01:59:50,130
The climate is forever changing like
that.

2929
01:59:50,190 --> 01:59:52,930
That's the problem is that people are
making it seem like that's something

2930
01:59:52,931 --> 01:59:54,550
weird.
It's not unique.

2931
01:59:54,750 --> 01:59:58,030
You're misrepresenting the issue.
The issue is people think that human

2932
01:59:58,031 --> 02:00:01,280
beings are exacerbating climate change
to the point where there's a.

2933
02:00:01,390 --> 02:00:04,210
there's a tipping point.
We cross over that tipping point.

2934
02:00:04,211 --> 02:00:08,860
We're going to deal with huge problems
that could be corrected if we act now

2935
02:00:08,861 --> 02:00:13,030
and put a lot of funding into climate
control and this is what Howard bloom

2936
02:00:13,031 --> 02:00:16,660
was on talking about a few days ago.
He was talking about that the real

2937
02:00:16,661 --> 02:00:20,140
future involves the technology of
climate control and that will we have to

2938
02:00:20,141 --> 02:00:25,141
be really careful of is letting it get
too far where you can't ever stop it and

2939
02:00:26,321 --> 02:00:28,360
pull it back.
This is what scientists are reporting

2940
02:00:28,361 --> 02:00:30,300
about.
This is why they want emission

2941
02:00:30,370 --> 02:00:33,430
standards.
This is why they want to figure out how

2942
02:00:33,431 --> 02:00:37,300
to get people to be aware of the fact
that this is a real issue.

2943
02:00:37,400 --> 02:00:38,680
Now,
it regardless,

2944
02:00:39,550 --> 02:00:42,550
human beings,
if they never existed,

2945
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:46,090
the earth has constantly gone through
cycles.

2946
02:00:46,360 --> 02:00:50,200
The question is not whether or not the
earth has gone through cycles of cooling

2947
02:00:50,350 --> 02:00:51,910
and warming.
The question is,

2948
02:00:52,210 --> 02:00:56,200
are we exacerbating that?
The vast majority of scientists say we

2949
02:00:56,201 --> 02:00:57,820
are now.
This could.

2950
02:00:58,390 --> 02:01:01,600
This could negatively impact all sorts
of coastal cities.

2951
02:01:01,720 --> 02:01:06,070
This can be a gigantic problem.
This is not like the propaganda that's

2952
02:01:06,100 --> 02:01:10,360
drummed up by some sort of big business
that seeks to make money off of this or

2953
02:01:10,361 --> 02:01:14,750
some sort of a organization.
Al Gore might've made some money off of

2954
02:01:14,751 --> 02:01:16,090
it,
but who's making money on that?

2955
02:01:16,110 --> 02:01:19,570
We were in
the amount of money that America was

2956
02:01:19,571 --> 02:01:20,920
losing,
but here's what I was gonna ask you.

2957
02:01:21,280 --> 02:01:25,750
So let's say amount of money.
America was losing who was the Paris

2958
02:01:25,751 --> 02:01:28,450
agreement because this is the reason why
we wanted to get out of the Paris

2959
02:01:28,451 --> 02:01:31,150
agreement is,
but that's why I wanted to get to say we

2960
02:01:31,180 --> 02:01:34,720
all agree that global warming is real.
I don't believe it's real.

2961
02:01:34,750 --> 02:01:37,020
Okay.
So I can't see the question,

2962
02:01:37,060 --> 02:01:39,950
but why have a belief?
What do you mean?

2963
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:43,700
Why have a belief as to whether or not
global warming is real or not real?

2964
02:01:43,750 --> 02:01:47,200
Because I just found in it you don't
understand the science,

2965
02:01:47,500 --> 02:01:50,560
but why have a belief in it?
So it's high believe it's not a belief

2966
02:01:50,561 --> 02:01:51,394
in.
I don't believe in it,

2967
02:01:51,600 --> 02:01:54,100
but that's what I'm saying.
But you have a belief that it doesn't

2968
02:01:54,101 --> 02:01:54,934
exist.
I,

2969
02:01:55,020 --> 02:01:55,801
I know,
I,

2970
02:01:55,801 --> 02:01:58,540
I personally think that this was just
the next.

2971
02:01:58,570 --> 02:02:01,300
The fact that it was presented to us by
Al Gore and it's just,

2972
02:02:01,510 --> 02:02:02,280
it was,
yeah.

2973
02:02:02,280 --> 02:02:06,560
Not presented to us by just by Al Gore.
Al Gore made a vr film and he's been

2974
02:02:06,561 --> 02:02:09,260
called like the first green billionaire
who's made a shitload of

2975
02:02:09,340 --> 02:02:11,940
the offer that he flies in his private
plane because he's so worried about the

2976
02:02:11,941 --> 02:02:13,290
emissions.
That is hilarious.

2977
02:02:13,480 --> 02:02:16,560
This is something hilarious about that.
But the people that are telling us a

2978
02:02:16,561 --> 02:02:19,830
fucking politician,
there's gross and all that stuff.

2979
02:02:20,150 --> 02:02:21,570
Right.
And that's what worries me.

2980
02:02:21,571 --> 02:02:24,960
So my question is,
let's say that it's real.

2981
02:02:25,440 --> 02:02:27,540
Let's just assume like,
if that's the best way to have,

2982
02:02:27,990 --> 02:02:29,140
let's say it's 100 percent.
Yeah.

2983
02:02:30,450 --> 02:02:34,500
Do you feel that you have found in your
research that there is something that

2984
02:02:34,501 --> 02:02:37,680
human beings can do that would change
this all around?

2985
02:02:37,850 --> 02:02:38,950
That's possible?
Yes.

2986
02:02:38,951 --> 02:02:41,410
One of the things that they're figuring
out how to pull carbon out of the

2987
02:02:41,411 --> 02:02:44,050
atmosphere and even even possibly reuse
it.

2988
02:02:44,440 --> 02:02:45,940
There's,
there's all sorts of things that people

2989
02:02:45,941 --> 02:02:46,960
were trying to do.
I mean,

2990
02:02:46,961 --> 02:02:47,860
we had,
um,

2991
02:02:47,950 --> 02:02:52,150
what was the young man who made that
device on slot?

2992
02:02:52,450 --> 02:02:57,370
He figured out a way to make this device
that pulls plastic out of the oceans.

2993
02:02:57,371 --> 02:02:58,510
They're figuring out a way.

2994
02:02:58,800 --> 02:02:59,633
Yeah.
I mean there's,

2995
02:02:59,810 --> 02:03:01,310
yeah,
there's a lot of plastic,

2996
02:03:01,311 --> 02:03:03,110
just can't like a overtime,
but that's what I mean like,

2997
02:03:03,111 --> 02:03:04,940
so when I say that I'm like,
like I,

2998
02:03:04,950 --> 02:03:07,770
I believe in recycling.
I'm not like a person that's like this,

2999
02:03:08,080 --> 02:03:11,060
but the idea that the government is just
going to take trillions of dollars

3000
02:03:11,061 --> 02:03:13,520
because we're in some agreement where
we're all agreeing that we should do

3001
02:03:13,521 --> 02:03:17,150
something is useless and,
and look from the stuff.

3002
02:03:17,380 --> 02:03:19,820
Like there's obviously a lot of debate
here and as I said,

3003
02:03:19,950 --> 02:03:23,330
I'm not so at the one thing you always
find with me is I'll never pretend to be

3004
02:03:23,331 --> 02:03:26,300
so educated on something like I'm not
going onto college campuses talking

3005
02:03:26,301 --> 02:03:27,710
about global warming.
I don't do that.

3006
02:03:27,770 --> 02:03:29,240
Right.
But why are you saying that you don't

3007
02:03:29,270 --> 02:03:30,140
think?
I just don't,

3008
02:03:30,141 --> 02:03:31,310
I just,
I don't know.

3009
02:03:31,311 --> 02:03:34,700
Maybe because it got so close maybe
because it got so politicized.

3010
02:03:35,140 --> 02:03:39,910
Studies into scientific agreement on
human caused global warming.

3011
02:03:40,480 --> 02:03:45,480
And look at all the studies.
It's between 100 percent and 91 percent

3012
02:03:46,271 --> 02:03:48,790
at the lowest.
Ninety one percent of one of the studies

3013
02:03:49,120 --> 02:03:52,390
from 2014.
Since the Union of concerned scientists

3014
02:03:52,650 --> 02:03:53,890
work,
they almost,

3015
02:03:54,290 --> 02:03:57,070
it's,
it's a pretty broad consensus.

3016
02:03:57,180 --> 02:03:57,931
Who did?
Who did?

3017
02:03:57,931 --> 02:04:00,240
Who are they?
I'm pulling.

3018
02:04:00,860 --> 02:04:02,610
Is it the people that are a part of
this?

3019
02:04:03,690 --> 02:04:05,940
It's a good question.
That's what I'm asking.

3020
02:04:06,500 --> 02:04:07,880
Numbers can 300,

3021
02:04:07,930 --> 02:04:12,930
six scientists to confirm over 97
percent of climate scientists agree and

3022
02:04:13,451 --> 02:04:17,050
over 97 percent of the scientific
articles find that global warming is

3023
02:04:17,051 --> 02:04:21,100
real and largely caused by humans.
So my question to you is if you want to

3024
02:04:21,101 --> 02:04:23,440
step outside of the scientific
consensus,

3025
02:04:23,710 --> 02:04:28,710
which is vast and involves 10,000,
306 scientists and just say,

3026
02:04:29,771 --> 02:04:32,350
I don't believe in it.
Even if you're right,

3027
02:04:32,800 --> 02:04:35,350
even if you're right,
you don't have enough information to say

3028
02:04:35,351 --> 02:04:35,940
that

3029
02:04:35,940 --> 02:04:36,800
right?
You might be.

3030
02:04:37,080 --> 02:04:38,030
Why I said this

3031
02:04:38,030 --> 02:04:39,980
was the thing you don't believe.
I don't know.

3032
02:04:39,981 --> 02:04:42,210
Yeah.
I would have to have someone sit down

3033
02:04:42,211 --> 02:04:44,700
and convinced me that it was real.
I personally don't believe it.

3034
02:04:44,701 --> 02:04:47,280
That's okay.
It's good to start at a place of not

3035
02:04:47,281 --> 02:04:48,540
believing something.
No,

3036
02:04:48,541 --> 02:04:49,890
it's not.
You think you should start with

3037
02:04:49,891 --> 02:04:53,250
believing everything he did not believe
either or not believe?

3038
02:04:53,251 --> 02:04:54,800
Yes.
Not believe no,

3039
02:04:55,110 --> 02:04:58,140
but don't say you don't believe I learn
about it,

3040
02:04:58,650 --> 02:05:01,650
learn about it and then have an opinion,
but you're stating this opinion without

3041
02:05:01,651 --> 02:05:04,220
having any real understanding of what
climate science.

3042
02:05:04,610 --> 02:05:06,480
But that's.
That's exactly what an opinion is.

3043
02:05:06,481 --> 02:05:07,410
I'm not going,
like I said,

3044
02:05:07,411 --> 02:05:07,830
if,
if,

3045
02:05:07,830 --> 02:05:10,380
if you said that Kenneth,
she went onto 10,000 college campuses

3046
02:05:10,381 --> 02:05:11,610
and you said that global warming isn't
real,

3047
02:05:11,611 --> 02:05:14,400
then we'd have a problem and I just
having a conversation.

3048
02:05:14,940 --> 02:05:17,880
Why have an opinion on something that
you don't have data about?

3049
02:05:17,910 --> 02:05:21,630
This is my question.
Like I don't necessarily have an opinion

3050
02:05:21,631 --> 02:05:24,810
on climate science.
I really don't know much about it,

3051
02:05:24,930 --> 02:05:29,930
but what I know is that what I've read
is that the vast majority of people who

3052
02:05:29,971 --> 02:05:32,350
study it or an agreement that human
beings are effect.

3053
02:05:32,351 --> 02:05:35,490
So I just my recall on a lot of things
that I read,

3054
02:05:35,491 --> 02:05:37,190
and this was a while ago,
so this is why I.

3055
02:05:37,210 --> 02:05:39,330
When I first formed my opinion,
not believing this,

3056
02:05:39,331 --> 02:05:42,780
I read it a shit ton of articles,
can't recall the data because like I

3057
02:05:42,781 --> 02:05:43,770
said,
this wasn't something I was super

3058
02:05:43,771 --> 02:05:45,930
passionate about.
It was like somebody posted something

3059
02:05:46,170 --> 02:05:47,910
and then I went on a tear or reading
about it.

3060
02:05:48,280 --> 02:05:51,510
Um,
but it was essentially just noting that

3061
02:05:51,511 --> 02:05:53,610
in a lot of these studies,
like when you go and you,

3062
02:05:53,730 --> 02:05:55,920
if we had time to sit down and really
pulled this up,

3063
02:05:56,190 --> 02:05:57,550
they're pulling,
you know,

3064
02:05:57,720 --> 02:06:01,290
10,000 scientists that are within a
community that is like these,

3065
02:06:01,291 --> 02:06:02,430
that works,
do you believe?

3066
02:06:02,431 --> 02:06:04,710
And everything that media matter,
media matters,

3067
02:06:04,711 --> 02:06:07,380
dot org puts out for statistics,
right?

3068
02:06:07,381 --> 02:06:10,140
That's a political,
that's a political arm of the Democratic

3069
02:06:10,140 --> 02:06:10,973
Party.

3070
02:06:12,510 --> 02:06:16,110
Politics versus science.
This has been politicized.

3071
02:06:17,790 --> 02:06:21,330
It has global warming in particular has
been politicized 100 percent.

3072
02:06:21,331 --> 02:06:22,770
It has been politicized,
right?

3073
02:06:22,771 --> 02:06:25,780
That's the whole reason that I fell down
this dark hole one night reading about

3074
02:06:25,781 --> 02:06:26,401
it and I didn't.
I was like,

3075
02:06:26,401 --> 02:06:29,610
you know what?
The day care it has been politicized.

3076
02:06:29,611 --> 02:06:32,340
And I think that's also maybe why you're
saying you don't agree with it so

3077
02:06:32,341 --> 02:06:36,990
quickly because it's an ideological
right wing point,

3078
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,360
right?
Is that global warming isn't real if

3079
02:06:39,361 --> 02:06:41,580
you're one of those people that thinks
global warming isn't real,

3080
02:06:41,581 --> 02:06:44,310
you're almost always on the right and
that's fine,

3081
02:06:44,311 --> 02:06:46,020
but I'm telling you that like,
again,

3082
02:06:46,620 --> 02:06:49,860
I didn't do a deep dive on all of this
because I read about it because it was

3083
02:06:49,861 --> 02:06:52,590
at a forefront of discussion and so I
read about it all night and my

3084
02:06:52,591 --> 02:06:55,200
conclusion was that they started pulling
up all of these studies and the person

3085
02:06:55,201 --> 02:06:57,810
that did this,
I did a deep dive on and they started

3086
02:06:57,811 --> 02:07:00,840
showing how like these community of
scientists were in fact,

3087
02:07:00,841 --> 02:07:03,240
somewhere behind that.org as someone
that was being funded.

3088
02:07:03,360 --> 02:07:06,520
So to me,
the issue got to politicize for me to to

3089
02:07:06,600 --> 02:07:10,170
to believe that global warming was
something that was going to wipe out the

3090
02:07:10,171 --> 02:07:12,790
world.
Now that is a fact,

3091
02:07:13,150 --> 02:07:17,490
but that doesn't mean that the funding
affects the scientific research and the

3092
02:07:17,491 --> 02:07:21,690
data which they all agree on.
And this is universally across the

3093
02:07:21,691 --> 02:07:25,830
entire plant.
Thousands and thousands of scientists

3094
02:07:25,831 --> 02:07:28,170
would not stake their reputation on
false data,

3095
02:07:28,420 --> 02:07:33,420
but what they're saying is not that the
only reason why the world is getting

3096
02:07:33,631 --> 02:07:37,030
warm is because human beings that the
only reason why the climate isn't

3097
02:07:37,031 --> 02:07:40,150
totally static for the rest of eternity
because of human beings.

3098
02:07:40,330 --> 02:07:45,330
What they're saying is we are negatively
impacting our own environment and we're

3099
02:07:45,461 --> 02:07:50,461
doing it because we have technology and
we use coal and fossil fuels and

3100
02:07:52,660 --> 02:07:57,660
emissions and we're raising our CEO two
levels and this is based on data and

3101
02:07:57,731 --> 02:07:58,150
this is.

3102
02:07:58,150 --> 02:08:02,260
This is something that you can look at.
You could look at the data and follow

3103
02:08:02,261 --> 02:08:05,860
where they're getting this information
from and follow how they're making these

3104
02:08:05,861 --> 02:08:10,420
conclusions and follow.
The vast majority of these brilliant

3105
02:08:10,421 --> 02:08:12,830
people study that shit their whole line.
Exactly,

3106
02:08:12,850 --> 02:08:15,310
and if I look,
if I was a person that was putting forth

3107
02:08:15,311 --> 02:08:19,720
policy on climate change or if I was a
person that put out by opinion publicly

3108
02:08:19,721 --> 02:08:22,390
on Paul on on climate change,
I would do all of that.

3109
02:08:22,420 --> 02:08:24,460
I'm just not.
I understand what you're saying,

3110
02:08:24,461 --> 02:08:26,680
but what I'm saying is that you are a
very smart person.

3111
02:08:26,681 --> 02:08:28,210
Yeah,
and people listened to you and they're

3112
02:08:28,211 --> 02:08:29,960
going to listen to for a long time,
I believe,

3113
02:08:31,650 --> 02:08:33,350
but hold on.
Let me finish what I'm saying.

3114
02:08:33,351 --> 02:08:36,430
To have a formal opinion on if you don't
have to have a formal opinion on

3115
02:08:36,431 --> 02:08:36,730
everything.

3116
02:08:36,730 --> 02:08:41,140
What you do have to have is the ability
to know when you don't know what the

3117
02:08:41,141 --> 02:08:44,180
fuck you're talking about.
You said you don't believe it.

3118
02:08:45,010 --> 02:08:46,780
Don't believe.
He asked me and I said this wouldn't be

3119
02:08:46,781 --> 02:08:51,781
the hill I chose to die on because I
don't say you don't believe in because I

3120
02:08:52,330 --> 02:08:57,330
personally do not have a belief until
you really prefer if my language as

3121
02:08:57,641 --> 02:08:59,890
opposed to admitting that I do not know
this.

3122
02:08:59,891 --> 02:09:01,240
I went diamond,
so I've never made a B.

3123
02:09:01,241 --> 02:09:03,250
I've never made a public statement.
You would have preferred if I had just

3124
02:09:03,251 --> 02:09:06,250
started by saying I have no.
I have no opinion.

3125
02:09:06,360 --> 02:09:07,420
No,
I don't know.

3126
02:09:08,020 --> 02:09:09,000
That's what I'm saying.
But you.

3127
02:09:09,010 --> 02:09:11,590
You say no.
You say I don't believe in it.

3128
02:09:11,990 --> 02:09:12,930
I don't believe it.
You.

3129
02:09:12,931 --> 02:09:15,100
You're saying really clearly that you
don't think it's real.

3130
02:09:15,340 --> 02:09:17,110
I mean,
I think it would be the same if I said

3131
02:09:17,111 --> 02:09:18,420
to you like,
you know,

3132
02:09:18,900 --> 02:09:22,430
do,
do you believe in God right now?

3133
02:09:22,430 --> 02:09:23,980
I would say I don't know if he would
say,

3134
02:09:24,940 --> 02:09:26,980
I feel like this is sort of like
linguistics though.

3135
02:09:27,070 --> 02:09:28,150
I would say.
I don't know.

3136
02:09:28,151 --> 02:09:32,710
I always say I'm agnostic.
I believe I believe it or I don't.

3137
02:09:32,740 --> 02:09:34,650
Right.
So it's like if you say a lot of people

3138
02:09:34,651 --> 02:09:37,280
say they don't know.
I think believers is definitely worth

3139
02:09:37,370 --> 02:09:38,650
associated with God,
but

3140
02:09:40,240 --> 02:09:44,320
don't say I don't believe in God.
And then somebody starts saying,

3141
02:09:44,321 --> 02:09:44,961
oh,
you need to form.

3142
02:09:44,961 --> 02:09:45,794
It did.
It's like,

3143
02:09:47,130 --> 02:09:47,651
no,
you don't.

3144
02:09:47,651 --> 02:09:50,070
Because God is not scientific data.
Right.

3145
02:09:50,320 --> 02:09:52,420
There's a big difference between
measuring the CEO two levels in the

3146
02:09:52,421 --> 02:09:55,480
atmosphere and deciding whether or not
there's an afterlife.

3147
02:09:56,420 --> 02:09:59,410
I,
I'm sorry that I just don't believe.

3148
02:09:59,530 --> 02:10:03,350
I don't believe in global warming.
I'm happy to try

3149
02:10:05,390 --> 02:10:08,500
to influence her.
You're a very bright person.

3150
02:10:08,980 --> 02:10:12,880
If somebody had asked me like at a place
for influencing on a college campus,

3151
02:10:12,881 --> 02:10:13,840
what's your opinion?

3152
02:10:13,840 --> 02:10:16,690
I would say I have nothing.
I bet you would say I don't believe in

3153
02:10:16,691 --> 02:10:18,900
it like you just did.
That is absolutely not what you,

3154
02:10:19,370 --> 02:10:21,640
we.
There are so many instances where you

3155
02:10:21,641 --> 02:10:22,391
could watch.
It's just like,

3156
02:10:22,391 --> 02:10:24,970
and you can ask Dave route,
but when he asks me a question I say I

3157
02:10:24,971 --> 02:10:27,940
don't have any opinion about a different
subject for you and I are having a

3158
02:10:27,941 --> 02:10:29,440
conversation one on one.
I'm not,

3159
02:10:29,441 --> 02:10:32,050
I'm not sitting here to try to.
I don't go on campus talking about

3160
02:10:32,051 --> 02:10:34,010
global warming because I don't,
I don't have an opinion on it,

3161
02:10:34,160 --> 02:10:36,230
but if you press me and asked if I
believe in it,

3162
02:10:36,650 --> 02:10:37,910
no,
I don't really believe in it,

3163
02:10:37,940 --> 02:10:41,330
but it could I go deep dive in and learn
that perhaps I'm wrong.

3164
02:10:41,720 --> 02:10:44,180
Sure.
I personally am inclined to believe that

3165
02:10:44,181 --> 02:10:46,220
a lot of those studies are manipulated.
Um,

3166
02:10:46,280 --> 02:10:48,680
as I said,
generally the one night that did deep

3167
02:10:48,681 --> 02:10:51,820
dive on it and when they showed like all
the pieces of evidence,

3168
02:10:51,830 --> 02:10:53,160
whatever,
it just seemed a little shady,

3169
02:10:53,161 --> 02:10:56,270
but I felt that it was politicized.
But I think I have a right to say that.

3170
02:10:56,271 --> 02:10:58,430
I don't believe in something,
but I also don't know and that's what I

3171
02:10:58,431 --> 02:10:59,630
said to you.
I don't believe in it,

3172
02:10:59,810 --> 02:11:01,970
but I wouldn't die on this hill.
I don't know enough about it.

3173
02:11:01,971 --> 02:11:02,470
I don't

3174
02:11:02,470 --> 02:11:05,770
when dinosaurs.
But you also said you don't believe in

3175
02:11:05,771 --> 02:11:08,920
it and you stated the reason why.
Because you think it's a scam.

3176
02:11:09,140 --> 02:11:09,973
Yeah,

3177
02:11:10,770 --> 02:11:11,710
that's true.
What do want me to.

3178
02:11:11,711 --> 02:11:12,910
You want me to lie to you?
It's okay,

3179
02:11:12,911 --> 02:11:15,090
but I just.
I'm not sitting here saying like heated

3180
02:11:15,110 --> 02:11:17,810
issue.
It's a very complicated.

3181
02:11:17,811 --> 02:11:18,640
That's fine,
but I,

3182
02:11:18,640 --> 02:11:20,060
I.
What do you want me to lie to you and

3183
02:11:20,061 --> 02:11:22,280
say I'm not a politician.
You want me to say you should the

3184
02:11:22,340 --> 02:11:24,410
correct term like the.
I feel like this is like the editing of

3185
02:11:24,420 --> 02:11:25,820
people do like when they're like,
oh,

3186
02:11:25,930 --> 02:11:27,330
a bond.
If they ask a question you don't know.

3187
02:11:27,800 --> 02:11:29,570
I'm not running for office.
I'm answering.

3188
02:11:29,571 --> 02:11:32,880
I'm talking to you.
I don't believe in it that I appreciate

3189
02:11:32,900 --> 02:11:33,920
you.
I can't be fake.

3190
02:11:33,930 --> 02:11:36,440
I die.
This is my number one problem in life is

3191
02:11:36,441 --> 02:11:39,200
I can't be fake and I know that you're
oppressing me or that you want me to

3192
02:11:39,201 --> 02:11:40,880
adjust and to say like,
I don't.

3193
02:11:41,060 --> 02:11:43,850
I do not have an opinion or the EPA.
I'm not a politician.

3194
02:11:43,851 --> 02:11:45,380
I'm telling you I don't believe in it.
Could I?

3195
02:11:45,410 --> 02:11:48,670
Could I changed my perspective of
leaving in a year after I read that?

3196
02:11:48,780 --> 02:11:50,270
If you were just a regular person,
you said,

3197
02:11:50,271 --> 02:11:51,770
I don't believe in that.
I'd probably go all right.

3198
02:11:52,130 --> 02:11:54,260
The problem is you're not.
You're,

3199
02:11:54,261 --> 02:11:55,730
you're,
you're a very.

3200
02:11:56,010 --> 02:11:58,470
When I'm aware,
I'm aware when I'm on stage,

3201
02:11:58,471 --> 02:12:00,900
when I'm on my youtube channel,
there's no videos of can.

3202
02:12:00,901 --> 02:12:02,430
If someone's talking about global
warming,

3203
02:12:02,431 --> 02:12:04,360
I'm aware of that.
There is now a.

3204
02:12:04,400 --> 02:12:05,233
yeah,
exactly.

3205
02:12:05,670 --> 02:12:07,590
Now it's going to be broken.
It can go either way.

3206
02:12:07,770 --> 02:12:08,550
I just.
Yeah,

3207
02:12:08,550 --> 02:12:10,310
exactly.
They were going to be mad at me because

3208
02:12:11,300 --> 02:12:14,560
you
know what's funny though is that like

3209
02:12:14,960 --> 02:12:16,830
this feels so like we're not on the
Internet right now,

3210
02:12:16,831 --> 02:12:18,630
but it's like I still don't feel like
we're on the Internet.

3211
02:12:18,631 --> 02:12:19,530
This is the problem.
Yeah,

3212
02:12:19,770 --> 02:12:21,840
but like if we were,
if you and I are on a college campus,

3213
02:12:21,841 --> 02:12:22,674
I'd be like,
Eh,

3214
02:12:22,890 --> 02:12:25,350
I'm not really sure.
I don't have an informed discussion on

3215
02:12:25,351 --> 02:12:27,420
it.
Jack Shit about global warming.

3216
02:12:27,421 --> 02:12:28,310
I really don't.
Yeah,

3217
02:12:28,311 --> 02:12:30,450
I think with the real fear is not even
global warming.

3218
02:12:30,451 --> 02:12:31,920
The real fear is global cooling.

3219
02:12:32,070 --> 02:12:35,450
The Ice Age is the most terrifying thing
that can happen to human beings that

3220
02:12:35,460 --> 02:12:38,130
should happen is everybody dies global
warming,

3221
02:12:38,131 --> 02:12:41,250
you just move inland.
I think that the real thing that people

3222
02:12:41,251 --> 02:12:44,220
are concerned about is like,
just beyond any of that stuff.

3223
02:12:44,221 --> 02:12:46,020
I don't know.
I think that there's more concerns in

3224
02:12:46,021 --> 02:12:46,651
society.
Like I,

3225
02:12:46,651 --> 02:12:50,310
I personally think that some scientists
are talking about global warming and it

3226
02:12:50,311 --> 02:12:51,720
got politicized.
They figured it was another way to

3227
02:12:51,721 --> 02:12:53,400
extract human beings money because of
fear.

3228
02:12:53,401 --> 02:12:55,950
That's my opinion.
I think there's probably some truth to

3229
02:12:55,951 --> 02:12:57,630
that.
There's definitely going to find our

3230
02:12:57,631 --> 02:12:59,100
core scientists that agree with
everything we say.

3231
02:12:59,101 --> 02:13:01,830
If it's improvement.
Harvard studies have been in incorrect

3232
02:13:01,831 --> 02:13:05,050
because they were being funded by
certain political interest group,

3233
02:13:05,051 --> 02:13:08,880
so I'm not inclined to pull up something
on and um,

3234
02:13:10,470 --> 02:13:12,060
I'm blanking.
It'll come back to me in a second.

3235
02:13:12,061 --> 02:13:15,000
But there were Harvard papers that had
been funded by certain researchers that

3236
02:13:15,001 --> 02:13:18,330
are trying to get a certain political
position out and it causes mass fear.

3237
02:13:18,660 --> 02:13:21,120
People are willing to spend their money
a certain way possible.

3238
02:13:21,121 --> 02:13:21,990
It is.
It's real.

3239
02:13:21,991 --> 02:13:23,250
That's very real.
People are flawed.

3240
02:13:23,251 --> 02:13:25,350
So I'm not inclined.
When someone pulls up an article and

3241
02:13:25,351 --> 02:13:26,020
says,
look,

3242
02:13:26,020 --> 02:13:28,110
a 10,000 scientists,
I err on the side of,

3243
02:13:28,111 --> 02:13:29,370
okay,
I don't know those scientists are.

3244
02:13:29,371 --> 02:13:31,440
I don't know what the organization is
by,

3245
02:13:31,590 --> 02:13:31,980
so I'm going

3246
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:33,660
to stick by my guns and say,
I don't really believe in it yet.

3247
02:13:33,720 --> 02:13:36,210
Now if I decide that I'm going to run
for office and I've got to make a

3248
02:13:36,211 --> 02:13:37,920
decision on,
on the atmosphere and,

3249
02:13:37,921 --> 02:13:39,090
and,
and what we're going to do about global

3250
02:13:39,091 --> 02:13:41,970
warming into two missions,
you better believe I will be fully ready

3251
02:13:41,971 --> 02:13:42,960
to discuss it.
I'm not gonna.

3252
02:13:42,990 --> 02:13:45,270
Make a youtube video and just know the
outskirts of it.

3253
02:13:45,271 --> 02:13:46,290
I don't do that.
Right.

3254
02:13:46,620 --> 02:13:48,540
But if you and I having a discussion,
sorry,

3255
02:13:48,541 --> 02:13:50,260
I don't believe it.
Like I would almost say

3256
02:13:51,960 --> 02:13:53,130
open,
open to learning,

3257
02:13:53,700 --> 02:13:55,230
open to learn.
I'm always open to learning.

3258
02:13:55,231 --> 02:13:56,760
I've,
I've been wrong before.

3259
02:13:56,761 --> 02:13:58,330
I was a liberal two years ago,
you know,

3260
02:13:58,540 --> 02:13:59,700
um,
or three years ago.

3261
02:13:59,701 --> 02:14:01,080
So that's,
that's not a problem.

3262
02:14:01,081 --> 02:14:05,100
I'm open to learning,
but I'm not going to like for like say

3263
02:14:05,101 --> 02:14:07,560
something that feels inauthentic and
what I wanted to say there was,

3264
02:14:07,561 --> 02:14:08,260
I don't believe in it.

3265
02:14:08,260 --> 02:14:09,860
It's one of those things that it's
become,

3266
02:14:09,910 --> 02:14:12,980
it's a real right wing talking points.
It's like there's very few,

3267
02:14:13,600 --> 02:14:16,560
like pro life is a very right wing
talking points.

3268
02:14:16,561 --> 02:14:18,960
Very few I would imagine.
I'm just guessing,

3269
02:14:18,961 --> 02:14:22,080
but very few liberals who are also
prolife well no.

3270
02:14:22,081 --> 02:14:25,560
So when I first went on Dave Rubin show,
he asked me about that and I said,

3271
02:14:25,561 --> 02:14:27,960
I don't really know.
I'm forming my opinion on it like just

3272
02:14:27,961 --> 02:14:29,400
like you and I just said about global
warming.

3273
02:14:29,401 --> 02:14:32,940
I said to Dave Rubin about a pro life
and pro choice,

3274
02:14:33,170 --> 02:14:33,961
um,
and he was like,

3275
02:14:33,961 --> 02:14:35,880
this is the first time someone has just
said that,

3276
02:14:35,940 --> 02:14:38,010
like just said that I'm forming an
opinion on it and didn't feel like they

3277
02:14:38,011 --> 02:14:38,910
needed to get an answer.
And I said,

3278
02:14:38,911 --> 02:14:40,830
I'm not a politician.
Same thing I'm saying to you like I can

3279
02:14:40,831 --> 02:14:42,600
answer how I feel and,
and,

3280
02:14:42,610 --> 02:14:45,510
and I'm happy to learn,
but that's a different kind of subjects.

3281
02:14:45,810 --> 02:14:50,700
But then I wanted to get really educated
on it and I became prolife but not

3282
02:14:50,701 --> 02:14:53,610
because I think people that are pro
choice or awful human beings,

3283
02:14:53,660 --> 02:14:54,493
um,
you know,

3284
02:14:54,610 --> 02:14:55,980
um,
who needed to burn in hell.

3285
02:14:55,981 --> 02:14:58,980
But just because the history of it is
really shady.

3286
02:14:59,200 --> 02:15:02,550
I'm with Margaret Sanger and because I
do recognize that it does seem a little

3287
02:15:02,760 --> 02:15:04,050
off putting.
I don't say like,

3288
02:15:04,051 --> 02:15:04,701
you know,
I'm,

3289
02:15:04,701 --> 02:15:07,110
I'm prolife,
but I just say to people that like,

3290
02:15:07,140 --> 02:15:11,130
the idea that the left is so pro choice
at the same time that they are running

3291
02:15:11,131 --> 02:15:13,110
around reporting to know black lives
matter.

3292
02:15:13,111 --> 02:15:15,900
It doesn't make any sense.
When you look at the numbers of black

3293
02:15:15,901 --> 02:15:18,770
babies never even get a chance to live
and when you look at the numbers and

3294
02:15:18,780 --> 02:15:22,980
just understanding that 17 million black
babies had been exterminated since 1973.

3295
02:15:22,981 --> 02:15:25,320
So what kind of black lives do you care
about?

3296
02:15:25,350 --> 02:15:28,350
I don't believe that baby's life starts
after three months.

3297
02:15:28,351 --> 02:15:30,420
I think that that's crap.
That's scientific crap.

3298
02:15:30,460 --> 02:15:31,920
Anybody.
We could probably pull up some articles

3299
02:15:31,921 --> 02:15:35,030
that say for sure the baby's life does
not begin until the three months.

3300
02:15:35,080 --> 02:15:37,950
We wonder the best indication that the
baby's life begins before it because you

3301
02:15:37,951 --> 02:15:39,390
have to rip it out of the stomach in
order to kill it.

3302
02:15:39,650 --> 02:15:40,260
It if,
if,

3303
02:15:40,260 --> 02:15:41,071
if you,
if left alone,

3304
02:15:41,071 --> 02:15:42,510
it would grow into a baby.
Right?

3305
02:15:42,511 --> 02:15:45,420
So I've thought about that issue and now
I have a stance on it.

3306
02:15:45,450 --> 02:15:47,100
Like,
and that would be my stance.

3307
02:15:47,280 --> 02:15:48,210
You know,
if I was president,

3308
02:15:48,211 --> 02:15:49,400
I'd say it's,
I don't want to be the president.

3309
02:15:49,401 --> 02:15:50,320
I'd states,
you know,

3310
02:15:50,540 --> 02:15:51,630
I.
let me say what trump said,

3311
02:15:52,090 --> 02:15:53,310
if I,
if I stepped up,

3312
02:15:53,370 --> 02:15:54,930
if my country needed me,
like I said,

3313
02:15:54,931 --> 02:15:57,270
10 years ago,
I would step up and I would do the job.

3314
02:15:57,450 --> 02:15:59,160
Right.
Do you have aspirations?

3315
02:15:59,430 --> 02:16:01,800
I.
I promise you I get this question all

3316
02:16:01,801 --> 02:16:02,760
the time on the road.
Kenneth,

3317
02:16:02,761 --> 02:16:04,290
do you want to be in the White House?
Do you want to be the White House?

3318
02:16:04,530 --> 02:16:06,810
I would love if Charlie Kirk was a
president of dates.

3319
02:16:06,900 --> 02:16:09,000
I would have fun being the press
secretary.

3320
02:16:09,300 --> 02:16:10,380
I'd be like,
just let him in,

3321
02:16:10,381 --> 02:16:12,120
let the dogs in.
Like I would choose.

3322
02:16:12,960 --> 02:16:17,430
It just looks like a fun job because
they're so crazy fun job does because

3323
02:16:17,431 --> 02:16:20,880
they're just so crazy and I.
I would just have fun at that too.

3324
02:16:20,881 --> 02:16:23,780
I feel like that's what I'm saying.
It would be a fun job.

3325
02:16:24,060 --> 02:16:25,860
They're so serious and like,
I'm like,

3326
02:16:25,861 --> 02:16:28,020
you take yourself seriously like Jim
Acosta.

3327
02:16:28,680 --> 02:16:33,680
Just be running the government of the
greatest empire the world has ever

3328
02:16:34,211 --> 02:16:36,400
known.
You think that would be fun?

3329
02:16:36,670 --> 02:16:38,830
That doesn't even seem remotely funny.
I know I'm being,

3330
02:16:38,831 --> 02:16:41,710
I'm being a little facetious,
but it insanely stressful.

3331
02:16:42,070 --> 02:16:44,740
Who's the press secretary?
Sarah Huckabee.

3332
02:16:44,741 --> 02:16:47,710
Sanders.
She looks stressed out.

3333
02:16:47,820 --> 02:16:50,620
I think she's just trying to have a game
face you just like a stupid question.

3334
02:16:50,730 --> 02:16:52,720
I'm like,
Jesus Christ.

3335
02:16:52,870 --> 02:16:54,160
It's one of those things.
It's like,

3336
02:16:54,610 --> 02:16:57,490
how far can you swim?
Some people could swim for sandy hours.

3337
02:16:57,850 --> 02:17:01,520
Nobody can swim forever and that's what
that job looks like to me forever.

3338
02:17:02,260 --> 02:17:04,230
Nobody can swim forever.
Yeah.

3339
02:17:04,420 --> 02:17:07,240
I didn't like,
I didn't start this because I wanted to

3340
02:17:07,241 --> 02:17:10,990
get into politics.
I started this because I saw a dial that

3341
02:17:10,991 --> 02:17:12,610
needed to be moved.
And what?

3342
02:17:12,611 --> 02:17:15,430
You're obviously a very ambitious
person.

3343
02:17:15,730 --> 02:17:17,260
You seem very ambitious.
It.

3344
02:17:17,280 --> 02:17:20,950
Listen,
I'm good no matter what space I'm in

3345
02:17:20,951 --> 02:17:22,540
weather,
like when I was in private equity,

3346
02:17:22,810 --> 02:17:25,360
I'm always good at my job.
When I put my mind to something,

3347
02:17:25,420 --> 02:17:27,580
I can do something and people will be
blown away.

3348
02:17:27,850 --> 02:17:29,170
That's always in my character.

3349
02:17:29,360 --> 02:17:30,193
Um,
and,

3350
02:17:30,280 --> 02:17:33,280
and I will do it despite people saying,
I can't look at that.

3351
02:17:33,281 --> 02:17:35,410
To me,
my whole to do list is people telling me

3352
02:17:35,411 --> 02:17:36,051
I can't,
you know,

3353
02:17:36,051 --> 02:17:38,500
like I don't like when people try to put
me in a box.

3354
02:17:38,501 --> 02:17:40,390
Like,
I really don't like the whole idea that

3355
02:17:40,391 --> 02:17:42,160
because you were this,
you can't be that.

3356
02:17:42,161 --> 02:17:43,870
It's like,
it's like I'm always going to decide

3357
02:17:43,960 --> 02:17:47,970
what's best for me and you to be
Republican in the first place.

3358
02:17:48,150 --> 02:17:51,520
I'm not Republican,
right wing Republican.

3359
02:17:51,521 --> 02:17:54,350
I'm independent.
I'm independent.

3360
02:17:54,360 --> 02:17:56,950
I know I would say.
I say I leaned right.

3361
02:17:57,040 --> 02:17:59,340
I definitely right.
Because that to me is just,

3362
02:17:59,350 --> 02:18:01,780
if you believe that people are allowed
to have different opinions,

3363
02:18:01,810 --> 02:18:03,370
you lean right?
Like literally,

3364
02:18:03,371 --> 02:18:05,740
that's where we're at right now.
Like it's like you're not even allowed

3365
02:18:05,741 --> 02:18:08,140
to have a dissenting opinion.
Second Amendment.

3366
02:18:09,450 --> 02:18:12,000
I just think the slippery slope,
pro life

3367
02:18:14,380 --> 02:18:18,330
anti global warming,
the anti global warming thing is like,

3368
02:18:19,060 --> 02:18:20,350
this is something that I've looked at.

3369
02:18:20,390 --> 02:18:24,640
Your organ has forced on me.
I genuinely like we're getting along

3370
02:18:24,641 --> 02:18:26,630
great,
right?

3371
02:18:26,800 --> 02:18:29,020
Like this is,
I just,

3372
02:18:29,070 --> 02:18:33,970
I have no reason to believe that because
some scientists that could very well be

3373
02:18:33,971 --> 02:18:37,210
funded as we constantly,
things are constantly being funded to

3374
02:18:37,270 --> 02:18:39,670
create a public perception.
I very much believe that.

3375
02:18:39,671 --> 02:18:40,880
I see that.
Um,

3376
02:18:40,890 --> 02:18:42,920
and we see this in the case of Donald
trump there.

3377
02:18:42,930 --> 02:18:45,490
If you go pull people in California,
they're going to say he's a racist

3378
02:18:45,491 --> 02:18:47,020
sentiment.
It's just whatever is put on the

3379
02:18:47,021 --> 02:18:48,310
Internet.
People believe as the truth.

3380
02:18:48,610 --> 02:18:51,760
I like to do a deeper dive.
I have not done deeper dive on global

3381
02:18:51,761 --> 02:18:53,260
warming.
Save that one night when I went down to

3382
02:18:53,261 --> 02:18:56,590
our coal or what other like right wing
talking points.

3383
02:18:56,591 --> 02:18:58,210
Is there anything that you don't agree
with?

3384
02:18:58,420 --> 02:18:59,440
Um,
yes.

3385
02:18:59,530 --> 02:19:01,690
Uh,
I don't know if this is still a thing,

3386
02:19:02,360 --> 02:19:06,930
but I like,
I fully support gay marriage and,

3387
02:19:07,090 --> 02:19:08,290
and,
and the reason is simple,

3388
02:19:08,300 --> 02:19:11,170
like regardless how people feel about
gay marriage,

3389
02:19:11,350 --> 02:19:15,640
the government has stepped in and is now
doing marriage and the idea that two

3390
02:19:15,641 --> 02:19:19,300
individuals that are in love to should
get tax cuts while the others shouldn't,

3391
02:19:19,660 --> 02:19:21,850
is nonsensical just because,
you know,

3392
02:19:21,851 --> 02:19:22,360
that doesn't make it.

3393
02:19:22,360 --> 02:19:24,460
So forget the.
I personally don't think the government

3394
02:19:24,461 --> 02:19:26,800
should have gotten involved in marriages
in the first place,

3395
02:19:26,801 --> 02:19:29,870
but they have you.
You can't sit here and decide that to

3396
02:19:30,140 --> 02:19:32,720
gay men don't get tax cuts.
And Amanda Woman Do.

3397
02:19:32,750 --> 02:19:34,820
That's wrong from a,
from a governing perspective.

3398
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:36,830
So if you're 100 percent.
Yeah,

3399
02:19:36,831 --> 02:19:37,910
that's a good one.
Yeah,

3400
02:19:37,911 --> 02:19:39,590
that's a good one because that's one
that gets slippery.

3401
02:19:39,591 --> 02:19:41,810
Even Caitlyn Jenner,
it isn't in a gay marriage,

3402
02:19:41,840 --> 02:19:45,350
which is fucking.
I know that one is.

3403
02:19:45,780 --> 02:19:47,820
Yeah,
this can't get anywhere.

3404
02:19:47,880 --> 02:19:50,630
I have cousins that are gay like it's
even though despite the fact that

3405
02:19:50,631 --> 02:19:52,580
Internet,
I found them anti lgbt,

3406
02:19:52,581 --> 02:19:54,890
which is insane.
But I just think that since the

3407
02:19:54,891 --> 02:19:56,930
government has,
has stepped up and decide it's going to

3408
02:19:56,931 --> 02:19:58,790
be in it,
if it's the governing body,

3409
02:19:58,791 --> 02:20:01,110
everyone should have a right to the same
tax customer.

3410
02:20:02,020 --> 02:20:02,990
They shouldn't be.

3411
02:20:03,240 --> 02:20:04,400
They shouldn't be.
That's the real problem.

3412
02:20:04,401 --> 02:20:06,100
But nobody talks about that.
They are.

3413
02:20:06,490 --> 02:20:07,560
Well,
everything you,

3414
02:20:07,970 --> 02:20:09,440
you have to get married through the
government.

3415
02:20:09,441 --> 02:20:11,240
You got to be saved from the government.
It gets recognized by the government,

3416
02:20:11,241 --> 02:20:12,040
your tax cut,
you know,

3417
02:20:12,040 --> 02:20:14,360
you get,
you can check certain boxes when you do

3418
02:20:14,361 --> 02:20:17,090
your taxes because you're married.
So since the government is doing that,

3419
02:20:17,270 --> 02:20:20,360
there's no reason why if,
if two guys live in the same house,

3420
02:20:20,361 --> 02:20:21,920
that they should not be allowed to get
tax cuts.

3421
02:20:21,921 --> 02:20:24,640
So the difference,
it's the separation of the church in the

3422
02:20:24,650 --> 02:20:25,483
state,
right?

3423
02:20:25,610 --> 02:20:27,140
Well,
the state has taken on something that

3424
02:20:27,141 --> 02:20:28,670
traditionally was in the church and
because they'd has,

3425
02:20:28,671 --> 02:20:30,320
you have to be looking at it
objectively.

3426
02:20:30,540 --> 02:20:32,600
Um,
despite your personal feelings.

3427
02:20:32,780 --> 02:20:34,100
Um,
it looked at objectively and every,

3428
02:20:34,101 --> 02:20:37,820
every person has a right to,
to get a tax cut because they married

3429
02:20:37,821 --> 02:20:42,560
the person that they love
100 percent with you on the gay marriage

3430
02:20:42,561 --> 02:20:42,740
thing.

3431
02:20:42,740 --> 02:20:47,280
So what other ones don't you agree with?
I don't know what the right way.

3432
02:20:47,281 --> 02:20:49,580
I don't even think about like,
right wing talking points.

3433
02:20:50,790 --> 02:20:52,080
So.
Okay.

3434
02:20:52,120 --> 02:20:54,020
So first off,
a chance just hilarious.

3435
02:20:54,021 --> 02:20:55,070
So it's funny,
you just jump in it,

3436
02:20:55,100 --> 02:20:55,933
you know.
Um,

3437
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,040
but.
So the number one thing.

3438
02:20:58,041 --> 02:21:00,290
So my whole shtick,
the only time I snapped back or get

3439
02:21:00,291 --> 02:21:01,460
upset,
it's because I'm really focusing on

3440
02:21:01,490 --> 02:21:02,620
community dude.
And the,

3441
02:21:03,080 --> 02:21:06,470
the committee that has been affected the
most by illegal immigration is a black

3442
02:21:06,471 --> 02:21:07,370
community.
It's just a fact.

3443
02:21:07,371 --> 02:21:09,260
I mean,
you talk about low wage workers,

3444
02:21:09,261 --> 02:21:10,370
the people that are the most
unimportant,

3445
02:21:10,371 --> 02:21:13,160
this company or our young black men
between the ages of 18 and 21,

3446
02:21:13,400 --> 02:21:16,100
right?
So they have been negatively impacted by

3447
02:21:16,101 --> 02:21:19,760
the influx of people running over the
border because they'll come here and

3448
02:21:19,761 --> 02:21:20,570
they'll say,
okay,

3449
02:21:20,570 --> 02:21:22,510
well you were going to pay this guy $7,
you know,

3450
02:21:22,540 --> 02:21:25,220
whatever the minimum wages will do it
for less.

3451
02:21:25,520 --> 02:21:28,130
And that directly impacts the black
labor force.

3452
02:21:28,250 --> 02:21:29,690
So I,
you know,

3453
02:21:30,350 --> 02:21:32,690
I recognize that we very much have an
immigration problem.

3454
02:21:32,691 --> 02:21:34,010
I think that the immigration,
you know,

3455
02:21:34,011 --> 02:21:36,020
they talk about diversity.
It's not diverse whatsoever.

3456
02:21:36,440 --> 02:21:38,330
Half of the immigrants that we take in
from Mexico,

3457
02:21:38,331 --> 02:21:39,530
that's not,
that's making America,

3458
02:21:39,531 --> 02:21:40,610
Mexico,
that's a problem.

3459
02:21:40,730 --> 02:21:42,890
If you want to take in some more from
from Africa,

3460
02:21:42,950 --> 02:21:45,230
that'd be great.
Only only three percent come from Africa

3461
02:21:45,440 --> 02:21:47,570
or I think four percent last year came
from Africa.

3462
02:21:47,850 --> 02:21:49,160
Tougher Commute.
It's,

3463
02:21:49,170 --> 02:21:50,090
it's,
it's tougher commute.

3464
02:21:50,091 --> 02:21:51,830
Right?
But the truth is that the argument that

3465
02:21:51,831 --> 02:21:55,200
is behind people that are like so pro
immigration and against the wall is that

3466
02:21:55,260 --> 02:21:56,930
it's about diversity.
It's not about diversity,

3467
02:21:57,320 --> 02:21:59,720
it's about diversity.
Let's go look around the country and

3468
02:21:59,721 --> 02:22:01,490
actually make a diverse.
There are tons of people that live in

3469
02:22:01,491 --> 02:22:04,100
Africa that worked their ass off.
I would love the opportunity to be in

3470
02:22:04,101 --> 02:22:09,100
America and we need to work that system
out just because they have a Geo Geo

3471
02:22:09,110 --> 02:22:11,240
advantage here.
Doesn't make it fair.

3472
02:22:11,241 --> 02:22:12,080
So,
um,

3473
02:22:12,200 --> 02:22:12,861
I'm,
I,

3474
02:22:12,861 --> 02:22:16,070
I'm not,
I'm pro coming up with a solution for

3475
02:22:16,071 --> 02:22:20,150
immigration because it's negatively
impacting running for president candice.

3476
02:22:20,151 --> 02:22:22,430
That's what I'm hearing.
I'm not running for president.

3477
02:22:22,431 --> 02:22:24,580
I'm here and people going crazy and
shit.

3478
02:22:24,990 --> 02:22:25,823
A

3479
02:22:26,410 --> 02:22:27,390
logo.
Let's just do it.

3480
02:22:27,391 --> 02:22:29,340
Looks like what would be my slogan?
Make America great again.

3481
02:22:29,341 --> 02:22:31,250
Is already taken.
He needed another one.

3482
02:22:31,740 --> 02:22:36,740
Keep making America better.
Even better.

3483
02:22:37,620 --> 02:22:38,970
Even more better.

3484
02:22:39,140 --> 02:22:41,270
You've been more better.
No,

3485
02:22:41,300 --> 02:22:43,970
but these speeds of the things that.
So anything like in every situation,

3486
02:22:43,971 --> 02:22:45,940
and you'll see this if you watch like
trial and I live on campus.

3487
02:22:45,980 --> 02:22:47,960
Let me do this.
Every situation when I'm asked my

3488
02:22:47,961 --> 02:22:50,600
opinion,
my answer is tailored towards the black

3489
02:22:50,601 --> 02:22:53,060
community because I just think that we
have really gotten the shit end of the

3490
02:22:53,061 --> 02:22:53,600
stick.

3491
02:22:53,600 --> 02:22:56,800
Did you write a lot of this stuff,
a lot of these thoughts out of these

3492
02:22:57,970 --> 02:22:58,900
locked in your head?

3493
02:22:59,020 --> 02:23:00,120
My had I read,
um,

3494
02:23:00,250 --> 02:23:03,070
I,
I make cards like to just remember

3495
02:23:03,071 --> 02:23:04,840
certain numbers and to watch.
Yeah.

3496
02:23:04,841 --> 02:23:05,674
And I just do that.
Yeah.

3497
02:23:05,860 --> 02:23:09,040
Kind of weird.
You out that a couple years ago you were

3498
02:23:09,050 --> 02:23:11,570
liberal and now you're not just a
conservative,

3499
02:23:11,571 --> 02:23:15,680
but you're on all these fucking cable
network shows and you're constantly

3500
02:23:15,681 --> 02:23:19,820
talking about it and you're the in a lot
of people look at you as like the hope

3501
02:23:19,821 --> 02:23:23,540
for the future.
You get a good looking 28 year old woman

3502
02:23:23,541 --> 02:23:27,560
who's super articulate and smart and you
could rattle off facts and Statistics

3503
02:23:27,561 --> 02:23:30,200
and talk real good on camera.
We got one,

3504
02:23:30,250 --> 02:23:31,340
we got a good one.
You know,

3505
02:23:31,341 --> 02:23:34,190
that's what they look mean.
Anyone young and vibrant.

3506
02:23:34,790 --> 02:23:37,580
That's what every political party looks
towards.

3507
02:23:37,970 --> 02:23:38,361
Like,
you know,

3508
02:23:38,361 --> 02:23:40,580
whether it's on the left or on the
remaining constant looking for somebody

3509
02:23:40,581 --> 02:23:41,750
on the left.
They're looking right now.

3510
02:23:41,751 --> 02:23:45,080
We need someone to go against trump.
We need someone good bleak

3511
02:23:47,060 --> 02:23:48,530
Charlie Booker.
We need someone.

3512
02:23:48,710 --> 02:23:53,590
We need someone like Charlie.
He's like an actor.

3513
02:23:54,530 --> 02:23:56,690
He's just an actor is.
It just doesn't come across as authentic

3514
02:23:56,691 --> 02:23:57,524
to me,
but whatever.

3515
02:23:57,900 --> 02:23:58,730
Yeah,
I am.

3516
02:23:58,730 --> 02:24:01,400
I do not like cory booker.
I know him whatsoever.

3517
02:24:01,820 --> 02:24:02,720
Great Guy.
Yeah.

3518
02:24:03,050 --> 02:24:05,240
He could be personally,
but he's a publicly.

3519
02:24:05,241 --> 02:24:07,730
He's representing himself fictitiously
in my opinion.

3520
02:24:07,760 --> 02:24:10,790
That's just my opinion is to.
It almost sounds like no,

3521
02:24:10,900 --> 02:24:14,870
stop that attack knows how to go on the
attack.

3522
02:24:15,200 --> 02:24:16,033
No,
I just,

3523
02:24:16,320 --> 02:24:18,560
I've just.
It's the language I really don't like

3524
02:24:18,561 --> 02:24:20,560
when people sit on a stage and go
racism,

3525
02:24:20,570 --> 02:24:21,321
racism,
racism.

3526
02:24:21,321 --> 02:24:22,610
It's just,
it's to me,

3527
02:24:22,611 --> 02:24:25,040
it's insulting to people's intelligence.
Talks about to me about what's going on

3528
02:24:25,041 --> 02:24:26,330
black minute.
You don't need to scare them.

3529
02:24:26,360 --> 02:24:28,640
Like it's the fear.
Politics pisses me off and that's what

3530
02:24:28,641 --> 02:24:30,230
they do every four years.
It's fear politics.

3531
02:24:30,420 --> 02:24:32,360
Well guy bought for us because racism,
racism,

3532
02:24:32,361 --> 02:24:33,270
racism.
It's not.

3533
02:24:33,730 --> 02:24:36,950
That's manipulating.
That's using fear to control what we do.

3534
02:24:37,070 --> 02:24:39,440
Okay.
We have a right to just be presented

3535
02:24:39,441 --> 02:24:41,240
with the facts and being allowed to make
a decision on our own.

3536
02:24:41,270 --> 02:24:42,770
That's.
That's my really perspective.

3537
02:24:42,771 --> 02:24:44,600
That's the big thing that's been so
controversial.

3538
02:24:44,601 --> 02:24:47,810
Candice Owens thinks that the black
community should be spoken to about

3539
02:24:47,811 --> 02:24:50,630
what's going on in their communities.
It shouldn't be thrown Jay Z and beyonce

3540
02:24:50,631 --> 02:24:52,190
concerts,
all law Hillary Clinton.

3541
02:24:52,340 --> 02:24:53,200
Right.
But like that.

3542
02:24:53,260 --> 02:24:55,020
Is that really that controversial a
thought?

3543
02:24:55,080 --> 02:24:56,360
It's,
it's broken the Internet.

3544
02:24:56,420 --> 02:24:57,590
I go out and I say,
Hey,

3545
02:24:57,591 --> 02:25:00,380
I think that there might be a little
more to the story that everybody's

3546
02:25:00,410 --> 02:25:01,910
racist and they go,
oh my God.

3547
02:25:01,911 --> 02:25:04,650
Like she can't say that I'm not the
first black conservative views.

3548
02:25:04,670 --> 02:25:07,910
I don't know why I'm the most like
controversial at this has turned into

3549
02:25:07,911 --> 02:25:08,300
like

3550
02:25:08,300 --> 02:25:10,870
we already highlighted it young and
you're good looking and you're all

3551
02:25:11,820 --> 02:25:14,380
looking conservative.
Articulate person farm.

3552
02:25:14,390 --> 02:25:15,840
Me and other young one.
Yeah.

3553
02:25:16,130 --> 02:25:18,140
How many have you got?
I don't know.

3554
02:25:18,290 --> 02:25:19,910
Young whip.
Smart.

3555
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:21,170
Fast with the tongue,

3556
02:25:21,310 --> 02:25:24,130
and I do want to say this.
I think that people like the.

3557
02:25:24,131 --> 02:25:25,040
Unless they say,
oh,

3558
02:25:25,041 --> 02:25:26,490
it's just because like she,
she's a black girl,

3559
02:25:26,491 --> 02:25:27,221
scream with them.
It's like,

3560
02:25:27,221 --> 02:25:29,290
no,
it's because for the first time someone

3561
02:25:29,300 --> 02:25:30,750
has the audacity and it's not the first
time.

3562
02:25:31,010 --> 02:25:33,010
You know,
I met with Secretary Ben Carson last

3563
02:25:33,010 --> 02:25:33,640
week.
Lovely man,

3564
02:25:33,640 --> 02:25:37,030
lovely managed time money or sometimes
he is brilliant.

3565
02:25:37,060 --> 02:25:40,170
Love all that shit.
When people were hating on him and angry

3566
02:25:40,171 --> 02:25:41,290
at him,
he never lost his cool.

3567
02:25:41,630 --> 02:25:44,920
He's so calm.
So imagine he and I are meeting and I'm

3568
02:25:44,921 --> 02:25:46,270
like,
they'll like knock them down,

3569
02:25:46,271 --> 02:25:47,110
like,
let me out.

3570
02:25:47,380 --> 02:25:47,870
Yeah.
Yeah.

3571
02:25:47,870 --> 02:25:48,860
He's like,
hello candice.

3572
02:25:49,210 --> 02:25:52,180
I was just like,
that's what you want for a dude is

3573
02:25:52,181 --> 02:25:54,690
operating on brains called.
Yeah.

3574
02:25:54,691 --> 02:25:55,970
Yeah.
And I'm like here's what we're going to

3575
02:25:55,971 --> 02:25:58,190
do.
We're going to have something to do.

3576
02:25:58,450 --> 02:25:59,710
And we just like love each other.

3577
02:25:59,710 --> 02:26:01,600
Like,
I mean like it was just a love affair.

3578
02:26:01,601 --> 02:26:02,160
Like I,
he,

3579
02:26:02,160 --> 02:26:04,780
it was,
I didn't realize that I was so

3580
02:26:04,781 --> 02:26:09,040
intellectually uninspired my whole life
because I was in a room of people that

3581
02:26:09,070 --> 02:26:11,920
didn't understand me and I never
realized how,

3582
02:26:12,170 --> 02:26:17,170
how misunderstood I felt until I got
into a room with like Secretary Ben

3583
02:26:17,500 --> 02:26:21,010
Carson and he just like got me and Andy
Armstrong Williams who was a close

3584
02:26:21,011 --> 02:26:23,770
friend of his and he just like got me
and Kanye West,

3585
02:26:23,771 --> 02:26:24,400
right?
Like,

3586
02:26:24,400 --> 02:26:24,911
who?
They just,

3587
02:26:24,911 --> 02:26:26,090
they get me and,
and it's,

3588
02:26:26,200 --> 02:26:30,580
it's been so inspiring and I'm so happy
and I don't think I've ever been this

3589
02:26:30,581 --> 02:26:33,070
happy in my entire life.
That's why it's hard for me to ever take

3590
02:26:33,071 --> 02:26:36,430
a negative perspective on anything
really except for global warming.

3591
02:26:39,620 --> 02:26:44,620
It's not real
because I'm,

3592
02:26:45,350 --> 02:26:46,360
I'm,
I'm like,

3593
02:26:46,390 --> 02:26:50,210
I feel so alive.
I feel by vicious and I,

3594
02:26:50,410 --> 02:26:52,320
I see the change happening in the black
community,

3595
02:26:52,360 --> 02:26:53,980
unlike all you have to do is be an
individual.

3596
02:26:53,981 --> 02:26:56,140
I do not tell.
I don't go on campus and say vote for

3597
02:26:56,141 --> 02:26:58,960
trump.
I don't say you need to be a Republican.

3598
02:26:58,961 --> 02:27:01,270
I actually have tons of palm with the
public and people just want ask me,

3599
02:27:01,300 --> 02:27:02,980
you know,
and they assume I'm a Republican.

3600
02:27:02,981 --> 02:27:04,870
They assume I'm a registered Republican.
That's just not true.

3601
02:27:05,110 --> 02:27:07,090
Um,
I and I fully support the president.

3602
02:27:07,091 --> 02:27:08,590
I love the guy.
I don't know what to say.

3603
02:27:08,591 --> 02:27:10,630
I love president trump.
I love his song.

3604
02:27:10,631 --> 02:27:13,660
I love don trump jr.
I love eric.

3605
02:27:13,661 --> 02:27:17,100
I love ivanka and that's controvErsial.
I love them.

3606
02:27:17,380 --> 02:27:18,610
They're great.
They're great people.

3607
02:27:18,611 --> 02:27:20,740
I want you to meet them because they're,
when you can't,

3608
02:27:20,741 --> 02:27:21,370
not like them,
like,

3609
02:27:21,370 --> 02:27:23,260
think about like,
like terribly wrong.

3610
02:27:23,990 --> 02:27:26,420
ThIs could go bad,
but think about like boundary.

3611
02:27:26,440 --> 02:27:28,570
Like,
this is a guy who is out hunting.

3612
02:27:28,571 --> 02:27:33,160
Moose friends of mine.
He's supposed to come in here,

3613
02:27:33,161 --> 02:27:36,040
we're supposed to play techno hunt
archery game.

3614
02:27:36,041 --> 02:27:37,210
And he helped me.
He's like,

3615
02:27:37,211 --> 02:27:40,720
you know,
really like a grizzly bear out in the

3616
02:27:40,870 --> 02:27:43,450
wilderness and nature and it's just like
they've gotten a really lIke unfair

3617
02:27:43,451 --> 02:27:45,840
shake in the media spokesperson.
I,

3618
02:27:45,870 --> 02:27:46,890
I love them.
I mean,

3619
02:27:46,900 --> 02:27:47,740
I,
it's authentic.

3620
02:27:47,741 --> 02:27:49,690
It's not.
No,

3621
02:27:49,720 --> 02:27:50,360
I'm not.
No,

3622
02:27:50,360 --> 02:27:50,591
no,
no.

3623
02:27:50,591 --> 02:27:52,540
I've actually explicitly say it.
I don't want to work on the

3624
02:27:52,541 --> 02:27:54,010
administration.
If someone came along and said,

3625
02:27:54,011 --> 02:27:57,460
we've got a sweet deal for you.
I've already been offered people just so

3626
02:27:57,490 --> 02:27:58,540
everybody knows who thinks,
oh,

3627
02:27:58,541 --> 02:28:00,430
she's pining for.
I've been offered shows.

3628
02:28:00,431 --> 02:28:02,080
Everything that you think that I've been
off,

3629
02:28:02,280 --> 02:28:04,570
I'm going to towards.
I've already been offered.

3630
02:28:04,571 --> 02:28:07,000
I've actually believe in what I'm doing
and I'm building my own company.

3631
02:28:07,090 --> 02:28:09,160
I believe in it,
super ambitious.

3632
02:28:10,120 --> 02:28:11,980
I don't want to work for anybody because
then you have confines.

3633
02:28:11,981 --> 02:28:13,390
Like let's say I went in,
for example,

3634
02:28:13,391 --> 02:28:15,160
worked for cnn or fox news,
right?

3635
02:28:15,370 --> 02:28:17,590
Then I can't say David Hall kind of
sucks,

3636
02:28:17,790 --> 02:28:21,090
but like at that tweet I would have had
to remove about chelsea handler outrage,

3637
02:28:21,310 --> 02:28:22,010
right machine,
and the

3638
02:28:22,010 --> 02:28:23,660
best thing ever is when jake sites lead.
I'm like,

3639
02:28:23,661 --> 02:28:24,580
ha ha,
no.

3640
02:28:25,160 --> 02:28:27,380
I'm going to retweet it.
You can get away with it.

3641
02:28:27,410 --> 02:28:30,380
Like samantha,
she did the right thing by apologizing.

3642
02:28:30,410 --> 02:28:33,170
She made the right action.
Take the correct action.

3643
02:28:33,230 --> 02:28:34,340
Yeah,
she did.

3644
02:28:34,370 --> 02:28:36,020
She took.
She'd made the correct action,

3645
02:28:36,021 --> 02:28:37,460
but what's so beautiful for me is I'm
free.

3646
02:28:37,461 --> 02:28:40,100
I say whatever I want,
and then they say deleted and I retweet

3647
02:28:40,101 --> 02:28:41,030
it.
Okay.

3648
02:28:41,031 --> 02:28:41,760
By the way,
that's.

3649
02:28:41,760 --> 02:28:43,010
That's to me,
that's freedom like that.

3650
02:28:43,020 --> 02:28:45,380
You can'T be like,
that's the best part of this is that I'm

3651
02:28:45,410 --> 02:28:46,820
truly free.
I can say whatever I want.

3652
02:28:46,821 --> 02:28:48,770
I don't have advertisers that you can
boycott.

3653
02:28:49,070 --> 02:28:50,440
Like it's just.
I can say my whole,

3654
02:28:50,470 --> 02:28:53,810
my twitter feed is just me.
That is a very powerful thing.

3655
02:28:53,840 --> 02:28:55,050
Yeah.
I feel so empowered.

3656
02:28:55,051 --> 02:28:56,180
It's a very good thing.
You know,

3657
02:28:56,420 --> 02:28:59,660
and I'm sure your ideas,
I mean you,

3658
02:28:59,930 --> 02:29:04,700
There's no better way to have your ideas
expressed than to have no one that you

3659
02:29:04,701 --> 02:29:05,534
are beholden to.

3660
02:29:05,820 --> 02:29:08,330
No boss.
I love that and that's why I was like,

3661
02:29:08,331 --> 02:29:09,310
you know,
I start working with charlie in there,

3662
02:29:09,311 --> 02:29:11,960
so I build my own company and now he's a
part of my company now we work for each

3663
02:29:11,961 --> 02:29:16,280
other and it's just like we're,
we're mission or mission driven and I do

3664
02:29:16,281 --> 02:29:17,510
support the president,
but I don't.

3665
02:29:17,511 --> 02:29:20,240
I don't want to go work administration.
That seems like a really the worst job

3666
02:29:20,241 --> 02:29:21,380
in America.
That's what I'm saying.

3667
02:29:21,400 --> 02:29:24,350
We need to be the secretary or press or
no,

3668
02:29:24,380 --> 02:29:24,981
no,
nope.

3669
02:29:24,981 --> 02:29:26,960
I'm particularly.
This administration has got it because

3670
02:29:26,961 --> 02:29:29,450
they have.
They're so angry and bItter about

3671
02:29:29,451 --> 02:29:31,280
losing.
Like I by that time 20,

3672
02:29:31,281 --> 02:29:32,590
24 comes around,
you know,

3673
02:29:32,600 --> 02:29:34,490
it'll be a little different,
but they've just been like,

3674
02:29:34,970 --> 02:29:36,380
oh.
Like they're just like,

3675
02:29:36,520 --> 02:29:38,520
if you can sense it,
they're angry.

3676
02:29:38,521 --> 02:29:43,000
Like definitely an ideological war going
on that it clouds a lot of thinking in

3677
02:29:43,001 --> 02:29:43,834
terms of winning.

3678
02:29:44,100 --> 02:29:45,230
I don't know.
You tell me who's winning.

3679
02:29:45,260 --> 02:29:48,100
We were winning.
We were republican now.

3680
02:29:48,770 --> 02:29:51,380
I didn't say it properly.
Can you just insert their code was we

3681
02:29:51,410 --> 02:29:53,120
know we're winning the independent
thinkers.

3682
02:29:53,121 --> 02:29:54,140
The people that think,
yes.

3683
02:29:54,160 --> 02:29:54,993
See,
see,

3684
02:29:55,430 --> 02:29:58,250
just check in.
See exactly your republican.

3685
02:29:58,251 --> 02:30:02,450
Now I know people that have this
mentality that people that are are,

3686
02:30:02,451 --> 02:30:03,720
are,
are freedom driven,

3687
02:30:03,721 --> 02:30:06,320
that just want to be able to have
different ideas and that's why I snapped

3688
02:30:06,321 --> 02:30:07,180
back at,
you know,

3689
02:30:07,250 --> 02:30:08,180
conservatives to.
I'm like,

3690
02:30:08,181 --> 02:30:10,220
I'm not a product of the right.
Don't think like,

3691
02:30:10,221 --> 02:30:11,210
I don't want people to go,
oh,

3692
02:30:11,230 --> 02:30:13,530
candace is just joining the lap.
Then she wants to create a model.

3693
02:30:13,531 --> 02:30:15,080
If on the right,
no wrong,

3694
02:30:15,290 --> 02:30:17,930
all I want walk you would do is
understand you have a right to like

3695
02:30:17,931 --> 02:30:21,410
certain ideas on both sides,
but you don't like what you should never

3696
02:30:21,411 --> 02:30:21,800
allow us.

3697
02:30:21,800 --> 02:30:24,710
For someone to use your identity to
define how you have to think.

3698
02:30:24,740 --> 02:30:26,510
You should always be the person to
finding how you think.

3699
02:30:26,690 --> 02:30:28,550
That's the message that I say on college
campuses.

3700
02:30:29,420 --> 02:30:30,960
That's a very good message.
Qantas,

3701
02:30:31,010 --> 02:30:33,210
we could probably talk for hours,
but I've got to get the fuck out of

3702
02:30:33,211 --> 02:30:34,370
here.
I got out of Wyoming.

3703
02:30:34,640 --> 02:30:36,130
Now you're going to Wyoming.
Yeah,

3704
02:30:36,170 --> 02:30:38,360
right now you're going to hang out with
kanye on the ranch.

3705
02:30:38,510 --> 02:30:41,240
Maybe.
Maybe that's what she's doing.

3706
02:30:41,510 --> 02:30:44,900
She's going to go ride horses and shit.
Piss off somewhere.

3707
02:30:44,930 --> 02:30:47,330
Liberals.
You're firecracker and good luck to you.

3708
02:30:47,331 --> 02:30:49,340
I really enjoyed talking to you.
We'll do this again sometime.
