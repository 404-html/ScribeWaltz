1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:05,070
I'm on the eve of an epic weekend.
The fights we come to live to break this

2
00:00:09,261 --> 00:00:10,320
shit down.
The Quito kid.

3
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,210
What's up,
bro?

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,043
What's up,
bro?

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,780
What is that?
That shirt reminds me of something and

6
00:00:15,781 --> 00:00:20,190
I'm trying to figure out what it reminds
me of some Japanese in the summer.

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,190
That was summer.
It's so fucking summer.

8
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:24,860
This isn't the yellow and I gave you
the.

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,860
The yellow one is so summer.
It's a fighter and the kid shirt with

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,580
Brian.
This is such a perfect shirt for Brian.

11
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:37,480
All of his pictures should be him
leaping pretending to be a ballerina for

12
00:00:37,481 --> 00:00:38,940
ells.
The endless summer.

13
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:39,783
Yeah.
Similar.

14
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:40,860
Yeah,
very similar.

15
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,600
So it's a collab with roots of faith
where we got the idea.

16
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,740
That's this summer.
What's your summer?

17
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,140
Every day in Venice Beach,
California.

18
00:00:49,141 --> 00:00:51,750
Unless you're a bum.
It was summer though.

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,880
That's true.
Hottest fucking a nice Tan.

20
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,370
That's true.
Nice Tan.

21
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:56,550
That's true,
Bro.

22
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:57,510
You don't.
I'll tell you right now.

23
00:00:57,511 --> 00:00:59,370
You don't wanna be on Venice beach
during July.

24
00:00:59,371 --> 00:01:02,130
Fourth at night.
Was that do I even posted?

25
00:01:02,131 --> 00:01:03,540
It was like the purge.
I was scared.

26
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:07,590
I might get in the car,
fucking google guns,

27
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,230
fireworks,
smoke.

28
00:01:09,231 --> 00:01:10,480
I was like,
holy garments.

29
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,020
You.
Oh yeah,

30
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,390
street.
We'll just shoot up in the air to those.

31
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,440
But they're not like shooting towards
the ocean,

32
00:01:16,441 --> 00:01:18,030
you know?
It was like a rap video.

33
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:21,780
I'd fucking flew.
I was stressed to.

34
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,600
I've been to Venice a few times and
every time I'm there I'm like,

35
00:01:24,601 --> 00:01:26,890
why would anybody live here?
Well,

36
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,450
you live in the middle of nowhere.
Where secluded.

37
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,770
I know that's your style.
I like to be able to be more in the

38
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:37,130
middle of nowhere.
I want to go straight to the woods off

39
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,250
with you.
I liked it.

40
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,770
Your kids might not.
You know what I'm saying?

41
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,280
I don't think they'd like Venice either.

42
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:47,490
There's a comfortable medium.
There's parts of Venice like what?

43
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,340
Like you on that,
but Kenny was just crowded as well.

44
00:01:50,341 --> 00:01:52,650
There's a nice little restaurants there.
It's a good spot to drop.

45
00:01:52,651 --> 00:01:55,470
Bank gets neat and true,
but she's packed and feel happy that you

46
00:01:55,471 --> 00:01:56,730
don't live there.
Well,

47
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,230
no.
See I live like away from the word

48
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,730
slower.
Like del Rey,

49
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,950
right on the beat.
That's nice.

50
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,920
If you have like a Prius,
it's a good place to live because the

51
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:09,360
parking spots were all like Prius sized.
That's why I can walk and that's why I

52
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,960
said because I like to be able to walk
everywhere to the genome.

53
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,110
Everything.
Ride my bike.

54
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,480
Run on the beach.
You would run on the beach.

55
00:02:15,481 --> 00:02:16,670
We're here at Sun.
No,

56
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,090
not.
I could run hills though.

57
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,240
It's cool
to.

58
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,830
He like to run the beach.
Yeah.

59
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,170
Oh yeah.
I can't be a better path,

60
00:02:25,171 --> 00:02:26,004
man.

61
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,500
You just like being.
You just don't.

62
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:29,940
You don't want neighbors.
Well,

63
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,460
this overpopulation,
it's not that I don't like neighbors.

64
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,610
There's a very clear overpopulation
problem.

65
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,350
Like A.
I told you I went to yellowstone a

66
00:02:37,351 --> 00:02:40,650
couple of weeks ago and one of the
things that I got out of that about

67
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,680
being in Montana and Wyoming is that
like you feel more at peace when you

68
00:02:46,171 --> 00:02:49,590
look at nature and there's less people.
It's more relaxing.

69
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,360
One hundred percent.
There's not the hustle.

70
00:02:51,361 --> 00:02:53,850
I think you need both though,
but there's a reason why there's no one

71
00:02:53,851 --> 00:02:55,680
out there.
You're in the middle of fucking nowhere.

72
00:02:55,681 --> 00:02:58,440
Your neighbors were the grizzly bear.
That's part of the reason.

73
00:02:58,441 --> 00:02:59,860
The big reason.
The winter,

74
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:05,370
the winter comes.
You can keep that and you like that shit

75
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,910
out of mind.
It just stay inside.

76
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,860
Make a fire.
Your kids are going to be miserable.

77
00:03:11,861 --> 00:03:12,970
You Muslim out,
maybe.

78
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,610
Maybe not.
Maybe they enjoy it,

79
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:19,150
so I saw a bunch of happy kids out there
right now.

80
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:23,200
If you move them out for good,
they have cell phones out there.

81
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:27,430
They have internet.
Very few differences culturally,

82
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,860
friends to have each other.
Oh,

83
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:33,130
there's plenty of pizza there.
You just said there's 35,000 people in

84
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:33,964
the town.
A lot.

85
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,070
That's a lot.
That's more than I thought.

86
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:42,730
How many people are in Venice?
At least a million to 20 million Venice.

87
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:46,780
Winning the size of a football field.
There's a million people live in their.

88
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,501
You know,
Abot.

89
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:49,840
Kenny just got a,
which is not a good thing,

90
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,380
but per square foot.
It's the most expensive street in Los

91
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:53,380
Angeles.

92
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,510
Just beat out rodale drive.
Oh God.

93
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,770
I know that.
It's beyond me.

94
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,810
How crazy is that?
It makes sense.

95
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,000
I've seen real estate in Venice.
It's insane.

96
00:04:01,001 --> 00:04:05,470
I saw a house that was for sale.
It was $14,000,000 and it was a house

97
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,710
just to fucking house.
I mean it's Venice man.

98
00:04:08,711 --> 00:04:11,980
It's to great restaurants,
friendly people,

99
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,150
Venice foot guys walking around.
Not not,

100
00:04:16,151 --> 00:04:19,160
you know,
know when,

101
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:22,480
when I first moved there like way way
back in the day I used to visit them

102
00:04:22,481 --> 00:04:24,940
there and I'd be like,
what in the fuck are you doing here man?

103
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,460
Like why here?
Well,

104
00:04:27,461 --> 00:04:29,860
but when you first moved here,
were you Hollywood?

105
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,060
No,
I first lived in Burbank at one of those

106
00:04:34,061 --> 00:04:37,420
Oakwood apartments and then I moved to
North Hollywood.

107
00:04:37,421 --> 00:04:41,800
My car got broken into and then I moved
to Encino.

108
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,560
I mean North Hollywood.
That's a hustle too.

109
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:45,543
You know what I'm saying?

110
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,700
Yeah.
You've been in done that like city life.

111
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,700
It's just too many people.
I agree.

112
00:04:51,701 --> 00:04:53,650
It's a lot of people.
I just don't think it's healthy.

113
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,560
I think when mean I think you can deal
with it,

114
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,280
but I think there's,
there's an effect of too many people on

115
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:02,740
you all the time around you all the
time.

116
00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:03,281
Buzz,
buzz,

117
00:05:03,281 --> 00:05:05,230
buzz,
all that data coming in.

118
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,270
I think it affects your thinking
process.

119
00:05:07,271 --> 00:05:12,040
I think it makes you accelerate,
like they did a study with a put cameras

120
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:16,580
up and cities and they monitored the
amount of footsteps that people take per

121
00:05:16,581 --> 00:05:20,110
minute and through the amount of
footsteps that people take per minute

122
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,720
and the amount of syllables.
As people speak per minute,

123
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,170
they can accurately determine how many
people live in that city.

124
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,280
Damn.
Yeah.

125
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,670
Like down to like a thousand,
you know,

126
00:05:30,671 --> 00:05:32,180
they can tell you like,
what's one?

127
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,750
This is 2 million people.
This is a city of 5 million people.

128
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:38,370
This is a city of 6 million people.
They could tell by watching people walk

129
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:42,220
and by listening to people talk because
when there's too many people around,

130
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:46,750
everything run ramps up and accelerates.
Like when I was in Wyoming,

131
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,460
you know,
but driving around yellowstone,

132
00:05:48,461 --> 00:05:53,140
it's so peaceful and relaxed and I came
back here and the moment we started

133
00:05:53,141 --> 00:05:55,630
driving home I started feeling it.
I was like,

134
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,010
everyone's driving faster.
Everyone's cutting everybody

135
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:58,910
off.
And I'm like,

136
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:02,210
this is a direct response to the
overpopulation issue.

137
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,700
Is it overpopulation or is it the
hustle?

138
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:05,800
You know,
it's this,

139
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:08,570
the American mindset,
the hustle where you got to make money,

140
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,220
get a job,
provide.

141
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,490
If it was Sunday,
they weren't hustling to go make money

142
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,260
to get.
We're just cutting each other off.

143
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,330
It's a bummer.
It's a bummer.

144
00:06:17,331 --> 00:06:19,520
And plus people don't really talk to
each other anymore.

145
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,220
There's not a lot of that.
Yeah,

146
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:25,700
well I think it's.
People aren't as valuable.

147
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:29,420
It's like if you have.
Do you ever see those things about Pablo

148
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,340
Escobar that he's to light fires with
like a million dollars?

149
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:33,770
Oh yeah.
Because he had so much fucking money.

150
00:06:33,771 --> 00:06:37,670
A million dollars wasn't shit to him.
The same thing happens with people.

151
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:41,120
If you live in a place that has 30
million people stuffed into it,

152
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:45,170
if you don't value people the way you
value people,

153
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:46,940
if you're in a small town,
that makes sense,

154
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,070
but you also don't know him either
because you can't.

155
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,443
Yeah,
you can't.

156
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,430
There's no way.
No,

157
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,930
there's no way you'd know less people.
Which is weird.

158
00:06:53,931 --> 00:06:55,910
Yeah.
Like I was talking to Jim Norton about

159
00:06:55,911 --> 00:06:59,480
that because Jim Norton lives in this
big ass apartment building in New York

160
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,830
City and he said,
I don't know anybody.

161
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,860
He goes,
I've said hi once to a guy that's down

162
00:07:03,861 --> 00:07:05,720
the hallway from me.
I don't know anybody else in the

163
00:07:05,721 --> 00:07:06,680
building.
And I'm like,

164
00:07:06,681 --> 00:07:08,100
how many people you think live in the
buildings?

165
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:12,110
Which thousand dollars?
Maybe more than 1000 people in the

166
00:07:12,111 --> 00:07:13,880
building.
You can go out of your way though to

167
00:07:13,881 --> 00:07:15,940
meet people.
Like last night I was at dinner at

168
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,410
Benihanas.
When's the last time I went to Bennett?

169
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,790
You kids like Benihanas?
Yeah,

170
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,750
we go to that place right there you go.
Talk to.

171
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,780
Don't dot my girl.
Her family.

172
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,670
Love it.
So we.

173
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,830
Yeah,
we went there and they sit with you sit

174
00:07:27,831 --> 00:07:29,340
with random people,
right?

175
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm trying to start a conversation
because we were having dinner together.

176
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:35,120
We're here for the long haul.
It's can show just not getting your

177
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,210
steak and then dipping out.
He's throwing shrimp at your face and

178
00:07:38,211 --> 00:07:40,940
all that shit.
So I'm trying to talk to them and it was

179
00:07:40,941 --> 00:07:43,040
exhausting man.
Because you would think they wanted

180
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:44,330
something from me,
you know what I'm saying?

181
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,111
Like was just like,
dude,

182
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:47,270
I literally just a friendly
conversation.

183
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,970
So it was weird because we were talking
about that last night.

184
00:07:48,971 --> 00:07:50,240
I'm like,
no one really talks to each other

185
00:07:50,241 --> 00:07:55,241
anymore and this is ridiculous.
When I was a kid I went to Benihanas and

186
00:07:56,001 --> 00:08:00,650
someone paid for my meal,
paid for the table and I remember I word

187
00:08:00,651 --> 00:08:02,270
whatever,
chicken and shrimp and I only had like

188
00:08:02,271 --> 00:08:06,190
$20 in my pocket and I was so stressed
and I had to drink water and all this

189
00:08:06,191 --> 00:08:07,660
stuff.
So someone paid for the meal and it was

190
00:08:07,661 --> 00:08:09,170
like the best day of my life.
So I was like,

191
00:08:09,171 --> 00:08:10,280
all right,
and I'm going to pay it forward.

192
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,260
So before we sat down,
I didn't know anyone.

193
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,420
I just gave the lady my card behind
them,

194
00:08:14,421 --> 00:08:16,910
like I'm gonna cover the table.
She's like,

195
00:08:16,911 --> 00:08:17,744
all right,
cool.

196
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,760
People on trying to.
People I'm trying to talk with.

197
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,500
It's their birthday,
right?

198
00:08:24,501 --> 00:08:25,320
It's,
it's the,

199
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:29,840
the girl's birthday.
She starts in fucking peanut Pina

200
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,960
coladas all sorts of stuff,
man.

201
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,110
I'm like,
God dog.

202
00:08:33,111 --> 00:08:36,890
I fucked
or and all sorts of shit.

203
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,000
It worked out though,
man.

204
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:40,820
That's it worked out.
But literally I was.

205
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,550
I didn't need anything from them.
I didn't want anything.

206
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:46,250
I just wanted to talk to them,
get to know him,

207
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,840
but I,
I guess I'm bigger dude.

208
00:08:47,841 --> 00:08:50,330
I gotTa fucking fall asleep that to
whatever you'd like.

209
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:54,050
They were almost scare on a date.
They were on a date,

210
00:08:54,051 --> 00:08:57,360
but it's still probably do is probably
trying to mack on his lady doesn't want

211
00:08:57,361 --> 00:09:01,650
some better looking dude.
Law Muscular with all tattoos and shit

212
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,810
talking.
I was talking to him though.

213
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,920
Yeah,
but doesn't matter.

214
00:09:04,921 --> 00:09:06,390
You eventually going to start target to
his woman.

215
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:08,320
He knows that's coming up.
The dude.

216
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,800
She's going to get all excited.
So now everyone wants to fuck your girl

217
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,210
down the nose.
Doesn't.

218
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,710
Family Environment.
People that they have motives.

219
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,770
They have ulterior motives.
There you go.

220
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,430
That's why you live in the fucking
mountains.

221
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:24,000
That's why I'm not starting up
conversations with random people at

222
00:09:24,001 --> 00:09:28,530
Benihanas and you don't talk to me.
I do.

223
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,360
It just don't try hard.
Yeah,

224
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,420
I mean if someone says something I'll,
I'll talk.

225
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,540
We'll start talking,
but I'm like,

226
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:34,830
Hey,
look at you folks.

227
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:38,180
You guys going crazy over there with the
shrimp shrimp,

228
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,420
isn't it?
Hey,

229
00:09:39,421 --> 00:09:41,910
do you like your with butter or garlic
or a shampoo

230
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,593
today,
man.

231
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,470
Yeah.
You're going to spend some time

232
00:09:46,471 --> 00:09:48,480
together.
I get it.

233
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,860
You know what I'm saying?
I get it.

234
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,780
Get the fuck out of Venice and broaden
your brain.

235
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,410
May Be men.

236
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:58,230
So a UFC 200 map.
There's not just UFC 200.

237
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:00,240
This.
This whole weekend is crazy because it's

238
00:10:00,241 --> 00:10:02,500
Thursday night.
When was the last time there was a.

239
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,580
not just a world title fight on fight
pass,

240
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:11,060
but a world title fight between half El
Dos Anjos and Eddie Alvarez on fucking

241
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,310
Thursday night.
Thursday and it's only on fight pass.

242
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,950
What they should do if that.
If it's like a bad ass fight,

243
00:10:16,951 --> 00:10:18,960
they should play that Friday or Saturday
for everyone.

244
00:10:18,961 --> 00:10:21,710
Who's this card?
This is a good card for Thursday night.

245
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,360
God Damn.
You Got Nelson and Derrick Lewis.

246
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:29,460
Lewis is your job on that handsome
mother fuckers bad and I don't know this

247
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:32,310
gentlemen Billao Mohammed.
Do you know him?

248
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,470
Mohammed?
Remember the name is his nickname.

249
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:35,940
I don't remember the name.
Mohammed.

250
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:38,370
He motherfuckers what?
Your same pants fan.

251
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,530
Remember the name?
Get out of here,

252
00:10:40,531 --> 00:10:44,910
dude.
Maybe he didn't pick that Joe Duffy back

253
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:47,730
on the fucking warpath against Mitch
Clark.

254
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,700
After dust employee a put a beating on
him and he did.

255
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,650
He got Mike pyle still doing the damn
thing.

256
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,440
He is this one.
How is he now?

257
00:10:55,441 --> 00:10:57,090
Forty two.
40 three.

258
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:01,500
He's been doing it for ever Griffin's
coach before.

259
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:04,230
Forces fighting.
Legendary Jim fighter.

260
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,680
Legendary.
Like before he ever became a UFC guy.

261
00:11:07,681 --> 00:11:09,870
Like everybody would talk about him
handling dudes.

262
00:11:09,871 --> 00:11:11,970
I've heard crazy stories about him.
That's a tough guy.

263
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:12,923
How old is he?

264
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,970
Yeah,
at least 40,

265
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,400
41.
I would say 43.

266
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,263
Forty,

267
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,113
40,
40.

268
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,650
Besides Dan Henderson,
it's

269
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:30,280
a Dan Anderson that young Anderson and
him and probably the same age.

270
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,250
Anderson's 40 now.
Right,

271
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,450
but that the lighter weight,
it's tougher to maintain this long of a

272
00:11:36,451 --> 00:11:38,430
career.
How many of these guys are pissed that

273
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:41,130
they weren't 46 years ago when t e,
r,

274
00:11:41,131 --> 00:11:44,770
t was in full swing.
Those were the glory days.

275
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:47,880
The glory days that uh,
I don't know,

276
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:48,491
man,
I,

277
00:11:48,491 --> 00:11:50,880
I mean I don't have flight path.
I don't want you on fight pass,

278
00:11:50,881 --> 00:11:54,850
but if that dos Anjos and Eddie Alvarez
cards or that fight is a fight of the

279
00:11:54,851 --> 00:11:56,770
night,
he got to play it on,

280
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,480
you know what I'm saying?
For the people just for notoriety as a,

281
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:06,070
as a world champion at 55,
I'm hearing Alvarez stories that he's

282
00:12:06,071 --> 00:12:08,680
training like a fucking demon man.
Yeah.

283
00:12:08,681 --> 00:12:09,301
I've heard,
I've,

284
00:12:09,301 --> 00:12:10,840
I've,
I saw his interview that he did where he

285
00:12:10,841 --> 00:12:13,240
said he did 150 rounds of sparring.

286
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,820
He doesn't believe in overtraining.
Excuse me sir.

287
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,760
It's not a debate.
It's science.

288
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:20,380
There's overtraining.
And he's like,

289
00:12:20,381 --> 00:12:22,480
I think someone just made that up
because they didn't want to train that

290
00:12:22,481 --> 00:12:23,314
date.
No,

291
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,450
that's not true.
The thing is,

292
00:12:25,451 --> 00:12:29,230
you look at his last two fights.
We beat Pettis and he beat Melendez.

293
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,730
They're not,
it's not,

294
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,571
it's not that.
I mean,

295
00:12:31,571 --> 00:12:33,460
granted he beat them.
It's not impressive.

296
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,490
He's not,
he's not like the dream Eddie Alvarez or

297
00:12:36,491 --> 00:12:39,640
the belt or do knocking dudes out.
Like we don't see that Eddie Alvarez

298
00:12:39,641 --> 00:12:41,690
yet,
and he said that's that that was his

299
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,960
plan,
but don't you think that a good part of

300
00:12:43,961 --> 00:12:46,390
that is because of the competition that
he's facing?

301
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:50,860
I mean he just.
Sure he's facing the toughest guys in

302
00:12:50,861 --> 00:12:52,540
the world.
So you change your fighting style?

303
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:53,970
No,
I just don't think he's capable of

304
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,480
fighting the same way against those
guys.

305
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,870
And winning.
I just don't think that you can go balls

306
00:12:58,871 --> 00:13:03,820
out against pedis and just slug it out
with him the way he slugged it out with

307
00:13:03,821 --> 00:13:06,760
some guys and other organizations.
True.

308
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:07,301
I mean,
he,

309
00:13:07,301 --> 00:13:09,010
he,
he went kind of,

310
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:12,490
he traded with Melendez but he has like
this clinching game now,

311
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:13,530
right?
Like it's this thing,

312
00:13:13,531 --> 00:13:16,360
it's,
I can't match up for him.

313
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:19,690
Melendez got a lot of miles on them now
at this stage of his career as well,

314
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,850
you know,
Amanda's had some injuries and a bunch

315
00:13:21,851 --> 00:13:23,380
of issues,
you know,

316
00:13:23,381 --> 00:13:25,900
uh,
Alvis had those fucking wars with

317
00:13:25,901 --> 00:13:28,690
Michael Chandler and you see how good
Michael Chandler looked the other day.

318
00:13:28,691 --> 00:13:30,330
Yeah,
he's a,

319
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,300
he looked good and not just good because
the knockout punch.

320
00:13:34,301 --> 00:13:36,640
But look good before that,
his footwork and movement,

321
00:13:36,641 --> 00:13:39,100
everything looked good.
I'd love to see him in the UFC.

322
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,120
Yeah,
I would too.

323
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,740
Especially after that fight,
man,

324
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:45,910
that one punch knockout.
But I bet spike is taking care of them.

325
00:13:45,911 --> 00:13:47,350
I bet they're giving them some good
money,

326
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:47,920
you know?
I mean,

327
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,400
should,
I mean I had a discussion with metro and

328
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:53,530
the other day and you know,
I discuss his financials but what he's

329
00:13:53,531 --> 00:13:56,010
getting paid and chandler being the
champ [inaudible],

330
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:59,320
I'm sure he's getting that paper mitre
on almost got slept.

331
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,650
That was crazy.
He got wobbling just crazy and now he's

332
00:14:02,651 --> 00:14:04,810
fighting.
I know that's not good.

333
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,040
And he was saying no,
he uh,

334
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:06,821
that's what I told him.
I said,

335
00:14:06,821 --> 00:14:07,491
dude,
it's not smart.

336
00:14:07,491 --> 00:14:09,400
And for what?
It's not like it's for a title.

337
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,020
If it's for a title.
Yeah.

338
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,690
Go get your money.
Become the champion.

339
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:15,130
Then rest,
he's fighting some Schmuck,

340
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,160
Somali Thompson guy who fought in the
UFC.

341
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,820
I don't think you want to fight in the
UFC.

342
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,800
So he's going over there to beat this
guy.

343
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:21,791
But then he was like,
dude,

344
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,140
this so much.
They're paying pain,

345
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:24,880
to be honest.
It's easy.

346
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,200
You know,
he didn't say this,

347
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:31,510
but this is me gauging from his mantra.
It's easy work from where he's coming.

348
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,240
Super easy work.
Maybe he could probably be both guys in

349
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:35,290
the same night.
Right.

350
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:38,020
But if he did get concussed in that
fight,

351
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,480
it's hard to tell.
If he did 100 percent,

352
00:14:40,481 --> 00:14:43,660
he has brain.
The brain suffered some sort of trauma.

353
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,510
You don't get wobbled and just like not.
I didn't feel anything yet.

354
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:50,530
Sat down to like his knees went,
his body sat down like it was a big

355
00:14:50,531 --> 00:14:51,560
deal.
It's been that way.

356
00:14:51,561 --> 00:14:53,050
Like when he fought Roy Nelson,
he was like,

357
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,060
I wasn't.
I wasn't even out.

358
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,913
And I was like,
Bro,

359
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,280
you got fucking rocked men maybe don't
remember it.

360
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,450
I'm telling you,
you have.

361
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,410
You had that brain trauma man.
When he sat down in the lights turn off

362
00:15:03,411 --> 00:15:05,360
even for a second.
That counts.

363
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,740
Oh yeah,
100 percent.

364
00:15:06,741 --> 00:15:08,900
The brain doesn't.
If it's a football head,

365
00:15:08,901 --> 00:15:11,450
if it's punch kick,
it doesn't give a fuck.

366
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,440
It's the brain rattling around.
Some guys take comfort in the fact that

367
00:15:15,441 --> 00:15:16,790
there were still conscious,
you know,

368
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:18,110
was like I was,
I didn't go out.

369
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,570
John Hendrick said,
same thing with wonderboy.

370
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,580
Yeah.
I didn't go out and I get that,

371
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:25,010
but if that ref isn't there,
your debt.

372
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,570
If this is the street,
you're dead.

373
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,910
Yeah.
Yeah.

374
00:15:28,911 --> 00:15:30,800
It's um,
it's a tough call for him.

375
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,270
It's tough for Matt.
He was just like,

376
00:15:32,271 --> 00:15:33,071
damn,
fighting this dude,

377
00:15:33,071 --> 00:15:34,760
this dude this,
whether payment of that get your money

378
00:15:34,761 --> 00:15:36,170
son.
It's tough because,

379
00:15:36,171 --> 00:15:37,850
you know,
if he thinks he could stop it,

380
00:15:37,851 --> 00:15:40,700
but then those are the fights that
sometimes you can get fucked up in

381
00:15:40,701 --> 00:15:44,060
because you think it's an easy fight,
don't you think?

382
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:46,670
I mean there's,
there's times where you step in and say,

383
00:15:46,671 --> 00:15:48,830
this is a fight that I can win.
Pretty easy.

384
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:51,830
True.
There's over the overconfidence,

385
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:56,860
but like rockhold and bisping for sure.
Rockhold was overconfident going into

386
00:15:58,581 --> 00:16:00,230
that fight.
A little too relaxed.

387
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,440
Almost disdainful.
Just did not give a fuck.

388
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:06,560
Just Dot Murray.
I woke up my baby up.

389
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:07,683
Ooh.
I know.

390
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,310
He jumped out of my seat.
I was so scared.

391
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,850
Did you hear John Jones talk about that?
He had a great point.

392
00:16:13,851 --> 00:16:15,230
Did you hear his interview?
What'd he say?

393
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,630
He goes,
because the media was like,

394
00:16:17,631 --> 00:16:19,820
you know all this criticism,
get for Osp,

395
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,200
and he goes,
hold on home criticism.

396
00:16:21,201 --> 00:16:23,120
Let's just go over this.
It was brilliant shit.

397
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,850
He goes,
what would you guys like to see?

398
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:26,750
I thought it was.
He goes,

399
00:16:26,751 --> 00:16:29,030
I thought it was brilliant.
He was number six guys in the world,

400
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,073
South Ball.

401
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,720
They change it on four day notice,
some shit like that.

402
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:35,360
He was the explosive south pulse number
six in the world.

403
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:38,540
He goes,
you want me to to act and dance around

404
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:42,650
and get knocked out like a Anderson
Silva did or maybe you wanted me to go

405
00:16:42,651 --> 00:16:44,360
in there and not respect them.
They get knocked out.

406
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:47,420
Luke rockhold w and what do you.
What do you guys want from me?

407
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,373
He was,
to me,

408
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,410
those guys will never be the same.
Like once they get knocked out like

409
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,450
that,
their legacy is over,

410
00:16:53,451 --> 00:16:53,991
man.
He's like,

411
00:16:53,991 --> 00:16:55,390
that won't be me.
I won't go down.

412
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,090
Go down as the greatest job.
You will never see me like that.

413
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:02,720
John Smarter in his approach,
he's definitely smarter and his approach

414
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:04,370
to fight,
he takes them very seriously.

415
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:08,360
Even if he's not 100 percent trained,
he doesn't fight reckless.

416
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,560
He fights,
he fights,

417
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,500
he takes chances,
but they're calculated chances.

418
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,380
He's improvisational in his,
in his movements.

419
00:17:15,381 --> 00:17:18,260
But John's a bad motherfucker.
I mean his,

420
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:23,300
the reason why he's gotten into fights
and not trained very much and you know

421
00:17:23,301 --> 00:17:28,301
and like been like fairly out of shape
is just his massive believer in what

422
00:17:28,491 --> 00:17:31,100
he's been able to pull off inside the
octagon.

423
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,520
But you would think especially out what
it was he 22 years old when he won the

424
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:38,120
world title against Shogun.
You'll see 1:28 against A.

425
00:17:38,121 --> 00:17:39,260
Yeah.
I can show you a new work.

426
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:41,110
So when he's there,
you,

427
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:45,050
if anyone's going to get overconfident
and do some bullshit,

428
00:17:45,051 --> 00:17:46,860
it's gonna be Jon Jones.
Dude.

429
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,541
That the.
To me,

430
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,980
that's why it's pound for pound best
because look at the guys he's

431
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,100
fighting like DC.
He only has one last thing.

432
00:17:53,101 --> 00:17:55,080
Not all the guys.
He's been that fight.

433
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,480
I don't care what anyone,
it wasn't that close.

434
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,200
NDC got taken down and kind of broke,
you know what I'm saying?

435
00:18:01,201 --> 00:18:04,870
So for the guys John's beating and what
he's doing to them,

436
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:05,723
that's why,
to me,

437
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:08,010
he's pound for pound best.
WHO's mighty mouse by next

438
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,820
you're not going to.
Yeah.

439
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:12,863
Cool man.
Yeah,

440
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,150
no,
very cool.

441
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:17,220
There's no comp comp comparison.
And then what's next for John?

442
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,650
Probably gastrin rumble,
rumble.

443
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:24,730
He's just fucking monsters.
And Glover going to fight in a two O

444
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:27,600
two.
So perhaps a winter that.

445
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,830
And we saw how it went against.
He just dismantled glover.

446
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,510
Yeah.
So I'm just saying at the margin of

447
00:18:33,511 --> 00:18:35,730
error for John and the way beating these
dudes,

448
00:18:35,731 --> 00:18:37,140
that's why he's pound for pound number
one.

449
00:18:37,141 --> 00:18:37,974
Greatest for me.

450
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,540
Well,
it's definitely an argument.

451
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,490
You know,
it's a subjective conversation.

452
00:18:41,491 --> 00:18:45,090
I think when you look at the movements
and what mighty mouse was capable of

453
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:47,080
doing it inside the octagon.
I don't think anybody touches,

454
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,700
but look at level of competition.
Well,

455
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,480
it's also because he's eliminating so
much competition.

456
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:54,690
Like what could he did to Benevidez?
Benevidez is a world class fighter,

457
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,550
knocks him out in the first round.
Look what it does.

458
00:18:56,551 --> 00:18:58,510
A Henry Cejudo Olympic gold medal.
Merck's.

459
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,240
I'm in the first round.
He had four fights.

460
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,530
Yeah,
I had more than that,

461
00:19:01,531 --> 00:19:03,660
but.
But I saying in the UFC,

462
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:04,680
you know what I'm saying?
Like he's not,

463
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:09,830
he's not this established bad ass like
St John's Merkin Gusta Fin v tour,

464
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,700
clover,
clover trail,

465
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:14,760
like all these legends to good point.
That's a good point.

466
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,160
That's what I'm saying.
But that interview,

467
00:19:17,161 --> 00:19:17,610
I,
I,

468
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:18,960
it was,
it was so good man.

469
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,360
Because do you guys are gonna criticize
me for this?

470
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,040
He was in Rhonda.
He goes,

471
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,810
what do you.
They overlooked her opponent.

472
00:19:24,811 --> 00:19:26,520
I'm not that guy.
I respect on this p.

473
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:27,451
well,
not only that,

474
00:19:27,451 --> 00:19:29,370
I,
I didn't think that performance was bad

475
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,740
because first of all,
I have a lot of respect for Osp.

476
00:19:31,741 --> 00:19:35,040
I think Osp is dangerous as fuck.
He hits really hard.

477
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,870
He's,
he's tough as shit.

478
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,150
And we saw that in that fight.
He broke his arm and the fourth round

479
00:19:39,151 --> 00:19:40,800
didn't say God damn thing about it.
Yeah,

480
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:44,110
very explosive.
You can't fuck around with Osp and also

481
00:19:44,111 --> 00:19:45,660
a you to,
you know this like,

482
00:19:45,661 --> 00:19:48,330
it's when people that have never fought
before,

483
00:19:48,331 --> 00:19:51,840
when you change from a,
from a traditional stance of south ball,

484
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,270
you're talking world of different.
The gap plans out the window,

485
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:57,300
especially with short notice is nuts.
Yeah.

486
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,350
No it is.
I mean,

487
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,100
and he did it because he realized that,
uh,

488
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,330
you know,
he was behind the eight ball already

489
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,030
going into that fight with all his
personal problems,

490
00:20:06,031 --> 00:20:10,960
all the bullshit he had to take that
fight or he felt like he had to get sort

491
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,720
of like back in the fans.
Good graces.

492
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,550
I did not think it was a bad
performance.

493
00:20:14,551 --> 00:20:15,810
A lot of people saying he looked
terrible.

494
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:19,200
I think he fought a really tough guy and
he fought smart.

495
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,320
Yeah.
Didn't really take that many chances for

496
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:24,360
really smart.
But also his mom that week got her leg

497
00:20:24,361 --> 00:20:25,330
amputated.
Yup.

498
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,840
Yup.
And you know what,

499
00:20:27,841 --> 00:20:29,760
he didn't fight for what,
15 months before that.

500
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,590
I think it was 16,
so 16 months.

501
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:35,730
So he had that because if that same John
fight dc that night,

502
00:20:35,731 --> 00:20:37,030
he had been in trouble,
you know,

503
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:41,520
maybe I don't know or maybe shows maybe
he gets another switch.

504
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:45,420
Well one of the things that he said when
I interviewed him after the fight is it

505
00:20:45,421 --> 00:20:47,140
wasn't physical.
He was like,

506
00:20:47,141 --> 00:20:49,660
physically I felt great.
He just like,

507
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:52,420
I just wasn't doing the things that I
wanted to do.

508
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,970
I wasn't,
I wasn't executing when I wanted to.

509
00:20:54,971 --> 00:20:58,330
I was hesitating.
I think he was under a tremendous amount

510
00:20:58,331 --> 00:21:00,400
of pressure.
I mean talking about a guy who came that

511
00:21:00,401 --> 00:21:04,900
close to going to jail and a lot of
people felt like his,

512
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:08,350
his choices outside the ring,
we're going to lead to his demise.

513
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,860
And there was a lot of talk about that.
I mean just the amount of pressure that

514
00:21:11,861 --> 00:21:14,770
he had to be under,
all the scrutiny,

515
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,690
all that.
That was a lot.

516
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,930
And then on top of that is also changed
his camp up quite a bit because you

517
00:21:19,931 --> 00:21:21,340
started doing a lot of power lifting.

518
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,890
Did you hear him talk about that?
Yeah.

519
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,460
He said that it helped me.
It hurt him.

520
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:25,900
He's not,
he's not lifting anymore.

521
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:26,740
He doesn't.
Well,

522
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,170
I don't know if that's the answer,
but he hasn't lifted this camp.

523
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,183
Well,
you know,

524
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,430
some people believe that you should do
it and some people believe that you

525
00:21:33,431 --> 00:21:36,100
shouldn't.
And some people believe that it's

526
00:21:36,101 --> 00:21:40,000
something to do in between camps and
that what you really should be

527
00:21:40,001 --> 00:21:41,830
concentrating on during campus.
Plyo.

528
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,693
Correct.
Yeah.

529
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,960
I think.
I think that's the.

530
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,650
And I think most experts agree like
outside of camp you build this,

531
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:51,060
this shell just you build your body as
healthy,

532
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,430
as big as it can get and then you go
into camp and you ditch that heavy lift

533
00:21:54,431 --> 00:21:56,440
and all that stuff and just focus on
your cardio,

534
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,540
explosiveness,
footwork and stuff like that.

535
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,690
I had a really good conversation with
Diego about that once Diego Sanchez and

536
00:22:01,691 --> 00:22:04,140
he was talking about how he treats it
dig.

537
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:09,010
It was very smart and as preparation and
that he takes time like in between the

538
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,910
safety as a fight,
like a.

539
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:13,350
he's fighting Miller this weekend.
Uh,

540
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:14,161
Lozan.
Oh,

541
00:22:14,161 --> 00:22:17,410
that's fighting Lozan.
So he's fighting lawyers on this

542
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:18,220
weekend,
right?

543
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,780
Shit.
Did he just fight Jim Miller?

544
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:20,920
Yes.
Yes.

545
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:21,790
He Won.
Right.

546
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:24,730
Beat Jim Miller did know.
I thought Jim Miller one who the fuck

547
00:22:24,731 --> 00:22:27,700
one that find the jail sanction Miller
won by decision.

548
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,440
Really?
Maybe I just picked them to win,

549
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:32,560
man.
I'm trying to remember that fight.

550
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,410
I don't remember that fight at all and
neither.

551
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,100
What's that?
Yeah,

552
00:22:36,101 --> 00:22:36,934
he did.
Boom.

553
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:40,120
Um,
so diego does all of his,

554
00:22:40,121 --> 00:22:42,460
uh,
pre before the fight,

555
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:44,920
like you know,
before fight camp starts,

556
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:48,580
he does a lot of physical training.
You get this cardio very high.

557
00:22:48,581 --> 00:22:50,860
He gets his weight lifting up.
He does all this different stuff,

558
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,090
but it doesn't do any sparring.

559
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:55,240
Who says drilling?
Does some drilling buddies mostly

560
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:58,440
concentrating on physical preparation,
like weightlifting,

561
00:22:58,570 --> 00:22:59,980
Yoga,
all that jazz.

562
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:05,160
Then he gets in a peak state of physical
condition than he enters at camp.

563
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,390
Fully.
Fully trained,

564
00:23:07,391 --> 00:23:09,760
like very,
very high rate of cardio.

565
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:13,460
Like he's not out of shape when he gets
into camp and then when he's in camp

566
00:23:13,461 --> 00:23:16,240
then he concentrates on a skill sets.
That's interesting.

567
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,890
Yeah.
I think it's a smart way to do it

568
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,170
because Klitschko does us a complete
different sports.

569
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,830
The Klitschko brothers did it opposite.
They would do,

570
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,770
um,
the,

571
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:31,020
the first day we call it pre camp,
they just focus on skills and like their

572
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:33,040
jab,
the straight right,

573
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:37,390
the very basics for two or three weeks.
And then when they'd go into camp they'd

574
00:23:37,391 --> 00:23:40,150
add and everything else.
But the first couple of weeks camp was

575
00:23:40,151 --> 00:23:41,650
just the basics.
Very,

576
00:23:41,651 --> 00:23:43,270
very basics.
But that's also,

577
00:23:43,271 --> 00:23:45,070
he's in his forties.
Klitschko is right,

578
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,190
isn't it?
This is before the.

579
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:47,900
I don't know what he's doing now.
This was before?

580
00:23:47,901 --> 00:23:49,160
Yeah.
How old is Klitschko?

581
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:52,250
Forty to 42.
I'd say 42.

582
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:55,620
But am I off on that?
Jamie heavily relies on Mexican

583
00:23:55,621 --> 00:23:56,540
supplements.
Right?

584
00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:00,770
The Russians have been known to dabble.
They've been known and he looks

585
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:03,170
fantastic.
He is bodied.

586
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,670
Hey,
did you see what Brock Lesnar said?

587
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:10,040
Hey,
I'm white and I'm jack.

588
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,130
Get over it.
Yeah,

589
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:14,900
Dude.
And I liked them.

590
00:24:14,901 --> 00:24:15,850
A lot of shit.
I actually liked.

591
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,090
I saw them like,
fuck you.

592
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,980
Hell yeah man.
Good free character.

593
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,870
He's a character.
He's a fucking character.

594
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,420
I would,
I would bet my entire life that he's

595
00:24:23,421 --> 00:24:25,730
dabbled in some of that stuff.
That's just what they do.

596
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:30,200
How when he was over there for sure.
But he's been tested five times or was

597
00:24:30,201 --> 00:24:31,970
tested five times in the last.
I heard about it.

598
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,800
True.
When,

599
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,570
when,
when he was clear to this Klitschko and

600
00:24:35,571 --> 00:24:38,060
Tyson fury,
the guy on the right,

601
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:43,061
beat them 40 by 40 Dad Bod beat him dad
bod beat didn't beat the shit.

602
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,990
Um,
but me beat him.

603
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,120
He beat him,
fucked his head up before the fight.

604
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:49,580
That was the big deal.
Klitschko beat them in the rematch.

605
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,180
You think so?

606
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:53,450
Yeah.
It was such a boring fight.

607
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,320
It.
But uh,

608
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:54,921
what we're talking.
Oh,

609
00:24:54,921 --> 00:24:57,450
with brock lesnar.
Did you hear what Mark said?

610
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,470
Mark goes,
they told me like three months ago,

611
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,720
hey man,
be ready for UFC 200 because,

612
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:04,643
uh,
we,

613
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:06,030
we were,
we might use you.

614
00:25:06,031 --> 00:25:07,280
So make sure you're in shape.
And he's like,

615
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,250
they've never done that.
You know what I'm saying?

616
00:25:10,251 --> 00:25:13,850
So it's like,
if you're bat shit crazy,

617
00:25:13,851 --> 00:25:15,620
if you think brock's for weeks,
he was like,

618
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,260
y'all fight at $200,
are they going to test me?

619
00:25:18,261 --> 00:25:19,430
I'm fine.
I'm clear.

620
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,680
Like it was obviously a plan,
you know what I'm saying?

621
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,900
And I'm not mad at it.
I get it for entertainment.

622
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:27,590
I can't wait to see the fight.
But you're batshit crazy if you don't

623
00:25:27,591 --> 00:25:31,170
think this has been an ongoing thing and
they're just saving this fucking bat

624
00:25:31,171 --> 00:25:32,290
card to save the.

625
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,670
I know it was an ongoing thing.
I can tell you.

626
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,130
I'll tell you everything that happened.
Okay.

627
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:39,590
There was a bunch of difficulties in
pulling this off.

628
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,390
Exactly.
A lot of it dealt with Vince and Vince

629
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:46,190
Mcmahon.
I say I call him vince because I don't

630
00:25:46,191 --> 00:25:50,350
know him at all that your friends with
typed.

631
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,520
But boy vinny.
Um,

632
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:57,500
so there was a lot of work to pull this
off and it was touch and go touch and go

633
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:00,050
was they weren't sure whether or not
they're going to be able to pull it off.

634
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,990
So it was something that they tried to
get done.

635
00:26:02,991 --> 00:26:07,040
But it took a long fucking time,
there was a lot of finagling and they've

636
00:26:07,041 --> 00:26:09,530
had some,
some cooperation before,

637
00:26:09,531 --> 00:26:13,490
like Rhonda,
she went over there and did some shows,

638
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,010
right?
Or did a show completely and um,

639
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:16,873
yeah,
but,

640
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:19,610
but that cross promotion can benefit
them.

641
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:21,440
So I think both,
both parties,

642
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,420
both parties.
So I think they wanted to work some

643
00:26:23,421 --> 00:26:26,330
stuff out and figure out how to do it
right and whether or not there were

644
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:29,360
going to do it right and whether or not,
you know,

645
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:31,640
it's,
it ain't easy to pull those things off

646
00:26:31,641 --> 00:26:36,140
when you've got a company like the wwe
and the UFC and they have egos.

647
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:39,050
Then you'll brock's,
they're freaking boy,

648
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:42,620
obviously he's their cash cow and then
he's the biggest draw of all time in the

649
00:26:42,621 --> 00:26:44,100
UFC.
I get that.

650
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,870
I wonder what could happen if Mark Hunt
lays them out,

651
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,430
you know,
I mean,

652
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:54,840
and here's another thing,
like the reason why he stepped back,

653
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,350
one of the reasons you talked about when
he said he wasn't going to fight again

654
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,660
was a few years back,
right?

655
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:03,150
Three years ago he said he was concerned
about concussions.

656
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:04,790
Brock said that,
yeah,

657
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:08,190
it's more cut and he's fighting bitch.
You're fighting Mr. Concussion,

658
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,720
concussion.
Fucking captain over the ask right now.

659
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:13,860
I mean,
yeah,

660
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:18,890
I mean he's fighting one of the best
strikers to ever compete in MMA in the

661
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,290
division head or in the ve world.
He gave me a list.

662
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:23,460
He's number one.
He's.

663
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:28,520
He's certainly in the list mean he's
more skillful than you might have a guy

664
00:27:28,951 --> 00:27:32,700
that hits harder than him physically
name someone in the heavyweight division

665
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:35,130
knocked out Roy Nelson.
Sir.

666
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,720
That's true.
That's true.

667
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:42,800
I mean it's arguable.
Knocked out some monsters,

668
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,490
knocked out a lot of fucking people.

669
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:46,550
There's no doubt about it.
He hit very,

670
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,780
very hard.
That's why you look at brock and his

671
00:27:48,781 --> 00:27:50,700
career.
I give him shit about the Dodo and all

672
00:27:50,701 --> 00:27:55,701
that as far as an athlete and hit the
balls of doing what he's doing because

673
00:27:55,831 --> 00:27:59,400
he doesn't have that many fights and
they just threw him to the fucking dogs.

674
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,910
You've married?
Started with heath herring.

675
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,450
He was frank mayor.
These randy couture,

676
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:07,920
far uber dream.
He fought the Uber and God dealt with.

677
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:10,800
He said he said the undertaker.
Yeah,

678
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:13,760
we ain't rehearsing this.
Here's a kick to the straight liver son.

679
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,630
He wasn't worried about being taken down
at all.

680
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:21,630
Didn't give a fuck.
Ubering looks so good enough.

681
00:28:21,631 --> 00:28:22,464
Fine.
Oh my.

682
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,690
To me,
that's the hardest fighter ever to be in

683
00:28:24,691 --> 00:28:26,760
the world.
Uber and I was scared.

684
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:28,410
I was still on the roster.
I'm like,

685
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,880
oh my God,
what if they call me with him?

686
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,700
What the fuck am I going to do the fuck
am I going to do?

687
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:35,760
It's not a good guy to fight.
Not that one.

688
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:37,200
Well,
it's that one.

689
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:40,620
That's almost.
I almost want to see what he could have

690
00:28:40,621 --> 00:28:42,160
done.
You know,

691
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,260
if we were on old school testing.
Oh everyone getting fucked up.

692
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,640
We all go.
And sizzler.

693
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:51,140
I mean that's a,
that's a good picture right there where

694
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:52,650
you get to see what he looked like,
but that's.

695
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,400
We don't flex and right.
Yeah,

696
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,790
that's the picture.
Good.

697
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:58,080
Googling the back.

698
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,210
Just like,
God damn what in the fuck.

699
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:00,841
I was like,
okay,

700
00:29:00,841 --> 00:29:03,870
how's he keeping that much mass on with
all that training,

701
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:04,733
you know?
Uh,

702
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:07,800
yeah,
I know exactly how Mexican supplements,

703
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,500
but it's fair.
You're crazy girl.

704
00:29:11,501 --> 00:29:13,980
Think Brock was doing some sort of like,
it's a fair fight.

705
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,410
Well,
um,

706
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:18,600
there's a lot of things that are fair
about it skillfully.

707
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,250
I mean,
skill wise,

708
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:25,200
look,
overeem is a far superior MMA fighter,

709
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,680
far superior striking.
They're on there.

710
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:31,740
It's almost hard to put into context how
much better he states that are on the

711
00:29:31,741 --> 00:29:33,990
same fucking planet.
Yeah.

712
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:39,080
I mean he's so much better.
And overeem knew it too because overeem

713
00:29:39,121 --> 00:29:41,440
had seen brock struggle with Shane

714
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:46,390
and a scene Brockett beat up by Cain and
he knew what he was going to do to him.

715
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:50,290
I mean that was a confident juice to the
tits over.

716
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:56,090
He came in that mother fucker guns
blazing but also shit.

717
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:00,030
I mean he didn't just walk unfortunately
that bullshit.

718
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:04,960
College double leg.
Shoot that fucking shit.

719
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:08,230
Ask the Gita how that happened.
Like ahead and fucking shoot.

720
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:11,920
But I'll tell you what,
man,

721
00:30:11,921 --> 00:30:15,940
I liked the way overeem fights now.
He's fighting smart as fuck now.

722
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:18,460
He moves around a lot,
picks his openings,

723
00:30:18,461 --> 00:30:20,800
throws those leg kicks when he needs
them.

724
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,380
And when he lands bombs on
motherfuckers,

725
00:30:23,381 --> 00:30:26,140
he's hurting people killing here.
Yes.

726
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,940
Yes.
Very skillful,

727
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:30,580
very skillful.
The way for junior dos Santos,

728
00:30:30,581 --> 00:30:33,570
I was heavily impressed and a lot of
people are juniors.

729
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:36,430
Done.
And then you see junior box the fucking

730
00:30:36,431 --> 00:30:38,410
ears off of Ben Rothwell and you go to
junior's.

731
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:41,290
Not done at all better than ever.
That's just how good at over him.

732
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,970
It's how good overeem is.
I mean,

733
00:30:42,971 --> 00:30:47,971
you're talking about a world class
kickboxer real world class Grom Prix

734
00:30:49,601 --> 00:30:52,150
champion.
He's the most decorated guy in the UFC.

735
00:30:52,151 --> 00:30:54,610
Striking wise.
Can you think of someone better hunt,

736
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,230
hunt,
hunt,

737
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:56,910
uh,
you know,

738
00:30:56,910 --> 00:31:00,370
is the only one.
But honestly when the hunt won the Grand

739
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:04,330
Prix,
hunt lost a decision and then the guy he

740
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:08,830
fought couldn't go on in the finals and
then he went on the finals in one.

741
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:11,470
Correct.
See the grand prixs is sketchy fucking

742
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,710
thing because you know,
it's a tournament.

743
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:17,200
And so you got to fight multiple times
in a night.

744
00:31:17,201 --> 00:31:21,610
And if you fight a guy who won by first
round knockout and you went through a

745
00:31:21,611 --> 00:31:25,450
three round war or even worse,
some of these guys went through through

746
00:31:25,451 --> 00:31:29,710
like when Joe Schilling fought in that
last man standing tournament in Los

747
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:33,580
Angeles when he fought a Simon Marcus,
he went three rounds.

748
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:36,790
It was a draw.
They went to a fourth round and then he

749
00:31:36,791 --> 00:31:39,880
knocked him out in a fourth round.
But he had been dropped in that fight.

750
00:31:39,881 --> 00:31:44,350
And then you gotta think that fighting
like that is,

751
00:31:44,351 --> 00:31:45,580
it's,
it's touch and go.

752
00:31:45,581 --> 00:31:49,300
So the guy who makes it to the finals
might not be the best guy.

753
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,960
He might just be less beat up.
Very fuck.

754
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:58,090
It's kind of cool because it had a
little bit of luck to do with it a

755
00:31:58,091 --> 00:31:58,990
little,
you know what I'm saying?

756
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,570
This punch lands I get out of there.
Well,

757
00:32:01,571 --> 00:32:05,680
didn't overeem beat go con Saki in the
finals?

758
00:32:05,681 --> 00:32:08,680
And I believe Saki had a broken arm
going into that fight.

759
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:09,730
That's right.
Yeah.

760
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,040
So there's that.
But over him,

761
00:32:12,041 --> 00:32:16,880
as far as just pure striking right now,
I don't think there's anyone better

762
00:32:16,881 --> 00:32:19,400
knocked out Badr Hari.
Yeah,

763
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,480
he did.
But the thing you had already stopped

764
00:32:22,481 --> 00:32:22,900
him.

765
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,940
But he,
Kod Barnett bought her heart with a

766
00:32:24,941 --> 00:32:29,941
fucking left hook from buhloone fucking
way bigger than what's been a high

767
00:32:31,661 --> 00:32:33,100
thinking will bother her.
He,

768
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,330
he,
uh,

769
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:36,760
he's been known to dabble in the Mexican
supplements himself.

770
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,950
He got pretty God damn big,
but bought her heart.

771
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,130
Going through a bunch of personal
issues,

772
00:32:41,131 --> 00:32:44,400
had been breaking dude's legs and
nightclubs to therapists are like

773
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:46,340
planets on fire.
He's crazy.

774
00:32:46,341 --> 00:32:50,540
I mean,
you see means fuck all that whole camp.

775
00:32:50,541 --> 00:32:54,740
Mike's Jim's filled with monsters.
Just Melvin Melvin manhoef.

776
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,870
Oh,
they got some monsters over their

777
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,000
monsters.
But the thing that my point was,

778
00:32:59,001 --> 00:33:01,580
is for brock with his experience,
fight,

779
00:33:01,581 --> 00:33:03,140
fight,
snack and monsters.

780
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,590
And right now brock doesn't need money,
although I'm sure he's getting paid the

781
00:33:06,591 --> 00:33:08,060
most that I have any fighter ever right
now.

782
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,180
He doesn't need money.
He just do it for the competition.

783
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,970
Yeah.
Which it shows you the type of balls on

784
00:33:13,971 --> 00:33:14,930
this dude.
Well,

785
00:33:14,931 --> 00:33:17,380
he has the type of balls anyway,
I mean you're talking about a guy who

786
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:22,400
won the world title against Randy Coture
in his fourth professional fight.

787
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:27,280
Fucking crazy.
No,

788
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:28,880
that is crazy.
That's fucking crazy.

789
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:31,240
I mean it's David Goliath and David
verse,

790
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:34,970
but it's still randy fucking coture
randy couture.

791
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:37,670
Even though he might've been the David
in the David versus Goliath.

792
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:42,290
That's a tough out.
That's a tough fucking bullshit.

793
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:46,070
And you know,
and Randy has so much experience.

794
00:33:46,071 --> 00:33:49,130
He's so grizzled.
That's where sometimes when like,

795
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,290
Huh,
well brock just saw and randy is.

796
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:54,440
Randy was just trying to strike with
them.

797
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:57,020
He's like standing in the pocket,
like slugging it out.

798
00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:00,620
I think he thought that that would be
his best way to win.

799
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:02,570
You know,
I'm going to keep that big fucker off of

800
00:34:02,571 --> 00:34:07,050
him and dropped him with a punch behind
the ear.

801
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,390
Yeah.
Prock is a gorilla.

802
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:11,420
He really is.
Just as a fig vanilla gorilla is a freak

803
00:34:11,421 --> 00:34:12,740
man.
They got some balls on him.

804
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,450
Yeah,
no doubt about it.

805
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:19,160
But it's interesting that a guy takes
this much time off the sport and comes

806
00:34:19,161 --> 00:34:23,180
back from,
comes off of two tremendous beatings

807
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:26,090
against two of the very best in the
division.

808
00:34:26,091 --> 00:34:27,320
And they weren't close.
No,

809
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,970
it's not like,
you know,

810
00:34:28,971 --> 00:34:31,700
John Jones got sooner,
Jon Jones dc where I went to decision.

811
00:34:31,701 --> 00:34:32,181
We're like,
fuck,

812
00:34:32,181 --> 00:34:35,630
I'd like to see that again.
Now you got murked and maybe he was

813
00:34:35,631 --> 00:34:37,480
sick.
Granted he was saying he's sick.

814
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:39,410
Certainly for the gang fight,
for the cane fight,

815
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:41,990
he was sick.
And then for the overeem fight,

816
00:34:41,991 --> 00:34:44,630
he's recovering from surgery by like six
months.

817
00:34:44,631 --> 00:34:46,550
I mean cold blooded,
right?

818
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:48,020
The Gut,
right in the gut.

819
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,060
And you need them in the gut to your
van.

820
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:52,670
Yeah.
Over him just playing for keeps man.

821
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:56,330
Well you gotta do fucking God ever
looked.

822
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,960
Nobody has any sympathy for brock
[inaudible].

823
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:01,700
So it brought it to Frank Mir beat his
face in and then it was pointing at him

824
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:04,100
and screaming at him and frank was so
out of it.

825
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,080
He didn't even know what was going on.
I mean,

826
00:35:06,081 --> 00:35:09,590
frank had just got sent to the outer
stretches of the universe.

827
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:13,110
That buildup was so rough though.
Remember Brock,

828
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:16,730
like walk off during the countdowns,
like how did it feel to get submitted?

829
00:35:16,731 --> 00:35:17,810
Like,
fuck this.

830
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:19,960
Rip The mic up.
Yeah.

831
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:22,580
All right.
Well we can wait and then frank just

832
00:35:22,581 --> 00:35:23,930
kept Jab,
Jab,

833
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,400
Jab,
and then finally,

834
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,810
yeah,
he fucking,

835
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,180
he beat the shit out of them.
Tenderize that face.

836
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,650
It was awful.
So bad.

837
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:34,220
Tough to watch.
It was that Kayo and Shane's Kale of

838
00:35:34,221 --> 00:35:38,010
mirror both of those two together.
If you watch those two side by silent.

839
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:41,790
Whoa.
It's referred to his guys had some tough

840
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:43,650
losses.
Tall.

841
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,560
He's been doing it since he was 19 and I
suspended,

842
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:47,130
right?
Yeah.

843
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:48,720
Yeah.
What did he test?

844
00:35:48,721 --> 00:35:52,330
Positive for
the same shit that,

845
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:58,840
that stuff maybe melodion doubted.
It sounds like some shit from Krypton.

846
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:03,980
It doesn't sound fake.
Melodious he,

847
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:06,360
I don't think he,
he might have been taking some real

848
00:36:06,361 --> 00:36:07,440
shit.
Yeah.

849
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,670
Yeah,
I mean heavy weight.

850
00:36:08,671 --> 00:36:10,920
What are you doing taking that shit?
Well,

851
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,930
probably just trying to keep his muscle
mass.

852
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:15,600
You know,
there's a lot of guys that,

853
00:36:15,601 --> 00:36:17,910
um,
especially like late into their career,

854
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:21,090
they start developing real testosterone
problems,

855
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,210
pituitary gland damage.
It's a real common issue with older

856
00:36:24,211 --> 00:36:28,620
fighters as well with concussion,
with football and professional fighters.

857
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,320
Because with head trauma it lowers your
testosterone.

858
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:33,490
Yup.
Losie testosterone.

859
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,400
Even if you look the same,
you don't feel the same.

860
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,130
You feel depressed,
you have low energy,

861
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:40,830
you know,
even if you keep most of the muscle mass

862
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:43,410
or at least you look like it,
it's hard to tell.

863
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:45,810
You know,
a guy might weigh the same,

864
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:50,840
but now he might be 20 percent body fat
instead of 10 or 15,

865
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:55,440
so five percent more body fat.
But really the quality of his body,

866
00:36:55,441 --> 00:36:57,300
the way it moves away,
it's just not the same.

867
00:36:57,330 --> 00:37:01,680
Completely different.
And the last thing to go is power and

868
00:37:01,681 --> 00:37:04,210
the speed and quickness the first.
But with heavyweight,

869
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,670
that's why you look at the heavyweight
division.

870
00:37:05,671 --> 00:37:08,220
Everyone's old man,
they still have all this power left.

871
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,140
So it's hard.
It's hard with the heavy duty,

872
00:37:10,141 --> 00:37:12,680
it's hard to tell a guy like frank,
you should probably retirement.

873
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:16,560
He was on our show awhile ago and he was
just coming off that loss and I was

874
00:37:16,561 --> 00:37:17,400
going to ask about retirement.

875
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,990
He was even thinking Nice Candle.
No,

876
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,460
what would I do that look at the
division,

877
00:37:20,461 --> 00:37:21,510
man.
Everyone's a whole.

878
00:37:21,511 --> 00:37:23,370
It's hard to argue.
Yeah.

879
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:25,260
You know what I'm saying?
It's really hard to argue because you

880
00:37:25,261 --> 00:37:29,710
look at guys like or Lawsky who oldest
fuck came back almost a loss of time and

881
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,370
stopped so many times and just doing the
damn thing.

882
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,950
Just keep on keeping on what?
Chin crazy.

883
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,780
Just keep going.
It's crazy.

884
00:37:36,781 --> 00:37:39,150
When you think about the deepest cut
world.

885
00:37:39,151 --> 00:37:40,420
Champ came back.
Yeah.

886
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,230
All these older dudes.
Just boys.

887
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,440
Not Young.
No.

888
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,840
Roy was on fucking ultimate fighter.
Thirty six years old.

889
00:37:45,841 --> 00:37:48,680
Just fucking Goddamn.
I'm 22.

890
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:51,780
What the fuck is he doing?
Their kids say?

891
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,940
It was like God dog.
What are you doing here?

892
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:54,661
Yeah.
What?

893
00:37:54,661 --> 00:37:57,990
Uh,
there's not a lot of like fresh young

894
00:37:57,991 --> 00:38:00,000
guns.
Steep as the youngest.

895
00:38:00,001 --> 00:38:01,500
And he's.
And he's the champ.

896
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,453
How old?
Steep Bay.

897
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,290
30 base.
Thirty one.

898
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,280
He's in his prime.
Tough fighting.

899
00:38:08,281 --> 00:38:09,420
It's over.
Raymond Cleveland.

900
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:12,210
Yeah.
Thirty three.

901
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:13,050
God,
Doug.

902
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:15,090
Yeah.
It's a tough fight against overeem.

903
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:20,010
Overeem right now has come into his own,
has gotten real comfortable and he's

904
00:38:20,011 --> 00:38:22,890
into that Wim Hof breathing method.
Oh Shit.

905
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,470
Yeah.
He's doing all that shit that.

906
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,100
That's made a big difference,
man.

907
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,830
I think psychologically it's made a big
difference too.

908
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:33,510
He's been working with Wim Hoff for
several fights now and he's won

909
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:37,750
something working for him with steep a.
everyone talks about these super cans

910
00:38:37,751 --> 00:38:39,970
and you have to come from a super camp.
Not Steve Bay.

911
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:40,661
No,
I'm a fuck.

912
00:38:40,661 --> 00:38:43,090
Is print out flyers and then jumping
into the gym.

913
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:45,610
Training with fucking billy from
Kinko's.

914
00:38:45,611 --> 00:38:48,580
Whipping his ass became world champ.
You know what I'm saying?

915
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,850
When they fight in Cleveland.
What a card is that?

916
00:38:51,851 --> 00:38:53,050
September?
That September,

917
00:38:53,051 --> 00:38:54,790
right?
I think so.

918
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:57,190
God Damn.
When is that?

919
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,830
Jamie?
For steep ass.

920
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,000
He has to apply pressure,
but he,

921
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,340
you know,
he likes to wrestle and people forget

922
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:06,280
fucking over and can wrestle.
Man.

923
00:39:06,281 --> 00:39:09,080
He certainly sounds probable.
I'm gonna fuck your kin Ras.

924
00:39:09,081 --> 00:39:10,570
All any capital?
Yeah,

925
00:39:10,571 --> 00:39:12,100
you certainly can.
What is it?

926
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,250
September 10th,
UFC 203.

927
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,790
Excellent.
That two.

928
00:39:15,791 --> 00:39:16,624
Oh,
two card.

929
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,100
Yeah,
there's a lot of great cards coming up,

930
00:39:20,101 --> 00:39:24,370
but let's pull up the graphic Jamie for
or two for for 200.

931
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,480
She almost said 100.

932
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,570
You think it's the greatest card of all
time,

933
00:39:29,571 --> 00:39:31,520
Huh?
Man,

934
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:33,920
I'd have to agree with you.
It might be.

935
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:37,370
I mean look what we got here.
We've got Jon Jones and Daniel Cormier

936
00:39:37,371 --> 00:39:38,930
is the main event.
That is an epic.

937
00:39:38,931 --> 00:39:40,760
God damn fine.
That's an epic fight.

938
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,490
Epic.
I got a question for you joe.

939
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,650
Okay.
Let's say you could only watch one

940
00:39:45,651 --> 00:39:47,570
fight.
It's either DC,

941
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:51,350
John Jones or listener Mark Hunt,
which gets more views.

942
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:54,080
More views.
Is Lesnar Hunt easy?

943
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:57,230
Yeah,
a hundred percent because I was without

944
00:39:57,231 --> 00:39:59,900
lesbian on this card.
This thing ain't breaking records,

945
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:04,100
but me personally I want to watch DC and
Jones.

946
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:08,750
Me Personally,
but it's a very close second for the

947
00:40:08,751 --> 00:40:12,050
freak show factor.
Lesnar hunts have very close second,

948
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:17,120
but DC and Jones is my number one pick
for that card because I want to see how

949
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:18,860
DC figures out.
Look,

950
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,500
I think DC,
when he fought Jones the first time,

951
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,380
I think John Jones fucked him up with
the wrestling.

952
00:40:24,381 --> 00:40:27,290
I think he didn't expect that.
It didn't expect John to be so big and

953
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:32,270
strong.
I think John outperformed out,

954
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:34,200
outworked him,
beat them.

955
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:37,770
I think John just beat them.
I think DC's a better fighter now.

956
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,440
I think gotten,
having gotten through rumble,

957
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:44,820
having gone through Gustafson and uh,
I think dc

958
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,330
made some real good points about,
you know,

959
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:52,990
how he would have performed versus how
osp would have performed in that fight.

960
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:56,320
And it might've been an interesting
fight and I think he's coming into this

961
00:40:56,321 --> 00:41:01,321
fight much more confident and much more
able to handle the trash.

962
00:41:01,571 --> 00:41:05,980
Talking in the bullshit.
That first fight was super emotional,

963
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,560
super emotional.
It's getting a little emotional now.

964
00:41:08,561 --> 00:41:13,480
You see Jon Jones get under the skin and
it doesn't phase John and I love DC DC

965
00:41:13,481 --> 00:41:14,920
knows this.
I'm way closer,

966
00:41:14,921 --> 00:41:15,754
decent.
I am done.

967
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:20,620
I just don't see what DC's going to do
different and his age and his training

968
00:41:20,621 --> 00:41:23,130
camp,
what he's going to do different to beat

969
00:41:23,131 --> 00:41:24,700
John.
Look at leg reach.

970
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:29,580
Jon's 45 inches DC zero.
They use.

971
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:32,530
How about you measure dcs legs?
Let's at least get it up there.

972
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:34,190
Everybody knows that John

973
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:37,280
has an advantage.
You can't just write zero inches fox,

974
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,920
so just take out both.
Who's running the fucking website?

975
00:41:39,921 --> 00:41:42,620
How hard is it to do that?
If I was Dana White,

976
00:41:42,621 --> 00:41:45,920
I'd be fucking details.
I'd be pulling my eyebrows out right

977
00:41:45,921 --> 00:41:46,930
now.
You go crazy.

978
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:49,610
The fuck are you doing?
Why does it say zero?

979
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,350
That's not good.
I just don't.

980
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:54,280
I'm not that intrigued with this fight.
The same way.

981
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,770
So weird.
I don't know.

982
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:58,050
I'll get shit for it.
Like the dominant Cruz.

983
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:00,860
You at favorite did nothing for me.
Both those guys.

984
00:42:00,861 --> 00:42:01,950
I wasn't then.
Yeah.

985
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,520
It wasn't like I got to see this DC
John.

986
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:05,271
I'm not.
Yeah,

987
00:42:05,271 --> 00:42:06,870
it's weird.
I don't know why John.

988
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,640
Maybe you can help me with like with DC
John.

989
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:14,930
I'm more interested to see the version
of John that comes out because that Osp

990
00:42:14,931 --> 00:42:18,100
one was very safe.
John just getting through to get to DC.

991
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:21,170
I that first fight to me wasn't that
close,

992
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:26,330
and then DC has one style fighting one
fucking stone and we've seen how that

993
00:42:26,541 --> 00:42:27,980
goes against John.
Good luck,

994
00:42:27,981 --> 00:42:30,650
man.
It was close enough that I think it's

995
00:42:30,651 --> 00:42:33,830
intriguing because it was five rounds
and uh,

996
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:36,280
I,
I think dc lost the majority of the

997
00:42:36,281 --> 00:42:38,360
rounds,
clearly lost a decision clearly,

998
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:43,690
but I think he,
he pose enough problems giving the fact

999
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:47,150
that I think that he was compromised
emotionally going into that fight.

1000
00:42:47,151 --> 00:42:50,660
I think he was overwhelmed and I think
he's learned and gotten better since

1001
00:42:50,661 --> 00:42:51,680
then.
So I'm curious.

1002
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:53,430
I'm curious,
you know,

1003
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:57,440
if I was a betting man who I am a
betting man,

1004
00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:02,540
you would 100 percent put money on John
Jones when you money based on the first

1005
00:43:02,541 --> 00:43:03,220
fight.
Yes.

1006
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:04,730
You'd have to.
Then also,

1007
00:43:04,731 --> 00:43:08,540
I think John needed that warmup fight.
I think having a fight against a guy

1008
00:43:08,541 --> 00:43:13,541
like osp being off for 16 months and
then taking out a top six guy and Osp

1009
00:43:14,061 --> 00:43:17,330
was a dangerous motherfucker and beating
him and you know,

1010
00:43:17,331 --> 00:43:18,350
people say you didn't look good.

1011
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:19,760
I just disagree.
I disagree.

1012
00:43:19,761 --> 00:43:22,840
I think it was a tough guy.
He fought a tough guy onboard.

1013
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:23,683
Think,
yeah,

1014
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,510
I think he performed very well.
So,

1015
00:43:26,511 --> 00:43:29,270
uh,
that's my number one fight for sure.

1016
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:33,770
But for the freak show factor,
Lesner lesner hunts the freakiest freak

1017
00:43:33,771 --> 00:43:35,750
show of the freak shows.
And by the way,

1018
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:39,890
when they were talking years ago,
when they were talking years ago about

1019
00:43:39,891 --> 00:43:43,040
Brock Lesnar coming back and Dana and I
want to have a conversation.

1020
00:43:43,041 --> 00:43:45,240
I said,
please mark on police.

1021
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:45,910
Oh,
you asked.

1022
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:46,743
That's what I was saying.
I was saying,

1023
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:49,120
please.
I go,

1024
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:50,630
that's the fight.
I go,

1025
00:43:50,631 --> 00:43:53,990
look,
if you got a guy who's the big fucking

1026
00:43:53,991 --> 00:43:55,220
power wrestler,
right.

1027
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:58,070
That has a little bit of a problem with
striking a little,

1028
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,060
little bit.
Yeah.

1029
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:00,830
Who Do you.
Who Do you pick them up against?

1030
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:01,491
Well,
you hit it,

1031
00:44:01,491 --> 00:44:03,920
pit them up against a guy who's built
like a fire hydrant.

1032
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:05,660
Right?
He's only like five,

1033
00:44:05,661 --> 00:44:07,790
nine.
He's 265 pounds.

1034
00:44:07,791 --> 00:44:12,791
Got To cut weight to get down to 65.
He hits like a fucking asteroidal

1035
00:44:13,281 --> 00:44:14,840
impact.
Straight up.

1036
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,750
Pretty takes a shot as good as anybody
that's ever lived.

1037
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:23,200
He's got these legs that don't even look
real like his knees are like you took 13

1038
00:44:23,211 --> 00:44:26,360
knees and glued them together.
They look like to tortoise shell.

1039
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:31,590
Fucking sea turtles.
So thick says everything about his

1040
00:44:31,591 --> 00:44:32,880
bones,
his head.

1041
00:44:32,881 --> 00:44:37,720
He's just deck and not.
He's not intimidated in the span of

1042
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:41,690
Brock Lesnar by anything.
Nothing doesn't give a fuck.

1043
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:43,110
Been there,
done that.

1044
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:46,390
He's a warrior.
Brock Lesnar also zero inch leg reach.

1045
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:48,890
Measure his legs.
You're giving them $50.

1046
00:44:48,891 --> 00:44:51,270
Billion Dollars.
Measure his fucking leg so it needs to

1047
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:54,000
get on that.
He did to me.

1048
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:58,380
So let's say worst case scenario for wwe
and the fucking UFC.

1049
00:44:58,381 --> 00:45:00,660
Let's say brock Lesnar,
he goes in there and it's like,

1050
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:01,030
hi.

1051
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:02,250
Hi.
Gets fucking

1052
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:06,900
fucking triple h I'm knocking your
fucking had it to the third row.

1053
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,320
So he gets merged in 30 seconds.
What is brock to psych?

1054
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:11,363
Ah,
fuck.

1055
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:13,080
You know what?
He's done.

1056
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,221
It's over,
right?

1057
00:45:14,221 --> 00:45:15,420
Yeah.
Would have three in a row.

1058
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:19,710
You got murked all three unless he just
decides like this is what I want to do

1059
00:45:19,711 --> 00:45:21,900
now.
And I only have like three or four years

1060
00:45:21,901 --> 00:45:24,750
left in my body.
What did we say was 38?

1061
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:27,400
Is that we said Barack is.
I mean,

1062
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:32,160
can't possibly have that much time left
in his body.

1063
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,580
If he wants to wrestle,
he can draw that picture is 38.

1064
00:45:35,581 --> 00:45:37,140
Yeah.
Yeah.

1065
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:42,170
So he's 38 years old.
I mean realistically a natural 38 year

1066
00:45:42,931 --> 00:45:45,690
old athlete.
It's just not much time.

1067
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,970
There's not much time.
Like yeah,

1068
00:45:47,971 --> 00:45:49,920
like I'm looking at my watch and about
seven,

1069
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:50,640
seven hours.

1070
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,490
Yeah.
I mean unless you're a guy like Bernard

1071
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:56,880
Hopkins and again,
and we using the word natural with air

1072
00:45:56,881 --> 00:46:01,440
quotes because boxing you can get away
with a lot of shit and not get caught

1073
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:03,330
some shit.
So who the fuck knows?

1074
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:05,340
I'm just saying hey,
I don't think he.

1075
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:07,710
But.
So Sophie Beats Mark Hunt.

1076
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:11,880
Let's say you get some down.
Fucking does is Brock Lesnar beat beats,

1077
00:46:11,881 --> 00:46:16,881
Mark Hunt and overeem beat Steve Bay.
They set it up.

1078
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:24,310
God Brock Lesnar
not.

1079
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:31,560
Could you imagine if the ratings would
go boom.

1080
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:34,170
And that's not something outside of the
realm of possibility?

1081
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:35,820
Not at all.
Neither one of those things.

1082
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,640
Neither one of those things are outside
the realm of possibility.

1083
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:42,680
If steep a beats.
Even if Steve Bay Beach Overeem,

1084
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:44,910
I think you could still possibly make
that fight.

1085
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:47,370
I think you make steep a brock.
Yes,

1086
00:46:47,371 --> 00:46:48,120
that's what I'm saying.
Steve.

1087
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,170
A beats over him.
Yeah,

1088
00:46:49,171 --> 00:46:49,530
for sure.

1089
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:53,430
But if over and beat Steve Bates and
natural 100 percent overeem gets on and

1090
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:55,770
look at the difference in his body,
I looked the same.

1091
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:58,070
He was on steroids.
Yeah.

1092
00:46:58,290 --> 00:46:59,280
Yes.
Yeah.

1093
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:03,570
Then you set that up and if brock shoots
a fucking power,

1094
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:08,571
double on overeem pins him against the
cage and beats him into oblivion.

1095
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,950
Oh yeah.
The biggest star of all time.

1096
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,990
Yeah.
He's the fucking time and he becomes the

1097
00:47:12,991 --> 00:47:14,550
new heavyweight champion.
Then Cain,

1098
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:19,750
he wants to fight cane again.
Can I get some dealt with kings?

1099
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:21,780
Got To get through Travis Browne.
I'll tell you what.

1100
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,810
He's a big favorite.
Cain is a tough motherfucker.

1101
00:47:24,811 --> 00:47:26,550
As tough as they get.
He.

1102
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:31,580
But you gotta think about the amount of
wear and tear on his body.

1103
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,260
Correct.
We're talking about knee operations,

1104
00:47:35,261 --> 00:47:38,110
shoulder operations,
back operations.

1105
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:43,120
There is a ton of stuff that's been
giving out on canes body,

1106
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:46,900
so you have to,
you have to be concerned with whether or

1107
00:47:46,901 --> 00:47:50,560
not he can make it through full camps
that anesthesia can't be good for you.

1108
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:53,920
Got It.
That's not

1109
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:01,330
to.
He comes out with a big bubble ass what

1110
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:05,020
happened when I'm under,
might as well get it done so I don't

1111
00:48:05,021 --> 00:48:08,210
have to go back.
Cane decided to get a job,

1112
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:09,770
stuff like that.
So to me,

1113
00:48:09,771 --> 00:48:11,370
this is my,
uh,

1114
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:13,940
if you're a betting man and you're like
draftkings or whatever.

1115
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:17,360
This is my upset pick.
I think Travis Browne is,

1116
00:48:17,361 --> 00:48:19,730
you're upset.
Pick here because keynes had so many

1117
00:48:19,731 --> 00:48:21,320
injuries,
grantee went through a full camp with

1118
00:48:21,321 --> 00:48:23,420
DC.
It's a fucking tough fight,

1119
00:48:23,421 --> 00:48:25,580
man.
Travis Travis hasn't looked great,

1120
00:48:25,581 --> 00:48:26,750
right?
He poked in the eye,

1121
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:29,270
he beat me.
He got knocked the fuck out by Orlowski,

1122
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:32,940
but the fighting live poplars of monster
man.

1123
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:33,823
He has A.

1124
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:39,300
Well,
I'm concerned with his camp and the

1125
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:41,870
amount of sparring partners he's
getting,

1126
00:48:41,871 --> 00:48:45,220
like he's not at Jackson's anymore,
which is just a hotbed.

1127
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:47,410
And you know,
there's two schools of thought,

1128
00:48:47,411 --> 00:48:48,520
right?
There's one school of thought,

1129
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:50,950
well,
he's getting much more individual

1130
00:48:50,951 --> 00:48:53,470
attention.
He's got one guy concentrating on them

1131
00:48:53,471 --> 00:48:55,780
all the time,
but he's working as Mitzi already knows

1132
00:48:55,781 --> 00:48:58,270
how to fight.
This is just an opportunity for and he's

1133
00:48:58,271 --> 00:49:02,260
working with curriculum Dell who's going
to help him tremendously with his

1134
00:49:02,261 --> 00:49:02,981
wrestling.
Rick,

1135
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:05,110
he's a fantastic grappling in vegas
though,

1136
00:49:05,111 --> 00:49:06,010
right?
Is Vicky?

1137
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:08,230
I think ricky was working with him.
He does.

1138
00:49:08,231 --> 00:49:10,570
He's been working with it for awhile,
but I don't know if he's full time.

1139
00:49:10,571 --> 00:49:12,060
Maybe it's going back and forth.
Either way.

1140
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:14,020
Rick is one of the best in the business.
He's fantastic.

1141
00:49:14,021 --> 00:49:15,730
Very,
very smart guy too,

1142
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:19,510
so I don't know.
I would have to find out and I will find

1143
00:49:19,511 --> 00:49:23,110
out this week what kind of training he's
getting in his camp.

1144
00:49:23,111 --> 00:49:26,320
Who is working with that makes a big
difference with the garlic travis,

1145
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:27,820
especially when you're fighting a guy
like,

1146
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,580
hey,
I wonder why travis moved away from

1147
00:49:30,581 --> 00:49:33,820
Jackson's.
Felt like that was such a great camp.

1148
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,760
What do you think what it was his face?
What do you mean?

1149
00:49:36,761 --> 00:49:38,380
You wonder why?
I don't know.

1150
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:39,850
Yeah,
I don't.

1151
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:40,683
Do you

1152
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:41,411
not really.
I mean,

1153
00:49:41,411 --> 00:49:43,050
he's off.
You're giving me the face.

1154
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:43,781
It's like,
it's.

1155
00:49:43,781 --> 00:49:45,370
I feel like it's pretty obvious.
Right?

1156
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:47,950
Don't like you moved.
He moved to Glendale,

1157
00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:50,060
his girlfriend's here.
They're living together like,

1158
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:51,880
excuse me,
sir.

1159
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:52,720
Okay.
That way.

1160
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:53,670
You know what I'm saying?
That's,

1161
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:59,770
that's not good enough for me.
Me fucking say Rhonda.

1162
00:49:59,771 --> 00:50:01,300
You ever thought about moving to New
Mexico?

1163
00:50:01,301 --> 00:50:04,480
It's fucking beautiful.
We'll go around the mountains together.

1164
00:50:04,481 --> 00:50:09,481
I'll find you a starbucks
gift card for starbucks is every time we

1165
00:50:10,601 --> 00:50:12,210
get a photo with her,
she's got a scene.

1166
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:14,590
It just looks delicious.
Beverage.

1167
00:50:14,591 --> 00:50:16,510
There's nothing wrong with that,
but they hope made hopefully their

1168
00:50:16,511 --> 00:50:18,000
sponsor.
But uh,

1169
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,320
yeah.
To me it's upset.

1170
00:50:20,321 --> 00:50:22,900
Pick if there is one on this card that
you're upset.

1171
00:50:22,901 --> 00:50:25,890
Pick.
Just because obviously I flat trousers.

1172
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:27,190
He,
he's a fucking nightmare.

1173
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:28,280
Deal with you.
So long.

1174
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:31,520
He's explosive.
And Keynes come off this long layoff,

1175
00:50:31,521 --> 00:50:32,354
man.
He's always hurt.

1176
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:35,510
There's gonna be some point and I
fucking guarantee it.

1177
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:37,070
We're canes.
Not the same.

1178
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:37,851
We're just like,
oh,

1179
00:50:37,851 --> 00:50:40,190
there it is.
It's like the age overnight because

1180
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:42,920
camp,
he's been wrestling since he was fucking

1181
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:44,720
two months old in diapers.
You know what I'm saying?

1182
00:50:44,721 --> 00:50:47,150
Well,
it's also all the stuff that you're

1183
00:50:47,151 --> 00:50:48,470
looking at that breaks,
okay,

1184
00:50:48,471 --> 00:50:50,450
look at what's going on,
shoulders,

1185
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:51,950
knees,
back,

1186
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:54,800
all that stuff.
For those are.

1187
00:50:54,830 --> 00:50:57,710
Those are things that are real hard to
come back from something you're not

1188
00:50:57,711 --> 00:50:59,060
talking about.
Like a broken hand,

1189
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:01,250
you know,
you're not talking about like snaps his

1190
00:51:01,251 --> 00:51:04,190
forearm.
You're talking about like critical

1191
00:51:04,191 --> 00:51:06,260
points of pressure,
right?

1192
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:08,090
Credit,
critical stress points,

1193
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:09,620
shoulders,
knees,

1194
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,080
back when those things start going,
man,

1195
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:14,120
as a fighter,
it's those.

1196
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:17,090
But,
and how much time is he had to truly

1197
00:51:17,091 --> 00:51:17,540
rehab it.

1198
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:21,260
Like we've seen pictures of his body
where it was just a few months ago and

1199
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:23,000
you know,
quite honestly didn't look good

1200
00:51:23,001 --> 00:51:24,530
physically.
He's never looked good,

1201
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,980
but he looked worse than he usually
does.

1202
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:30,200
He's been steady on the burritos and not
just that,

1203
00:51:30,201 --> 00:51:34,880
but it's also like muscularly.
He didn't look like he was built up the

1204
00:51:34,881 --> 00:51:35,701
same way.
No.

1205
00:51:35,701 --> 00:51:36,920
Yeah,
I did not look good.

1206
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:39,580
He's not the Quito Kid,
but uh,

1207
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:45,170
if there's a time for Travis to ever get
Cain Velasquez and now's the time now

1208
00:51:45,171 --> 00:51:46,790
and remember,
this is a three round fight.

1209
00:51:47,050 --> 00:51:48,350
If it's five,
oh,

1210
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:52,580
he taken you swimming sun into the deep
waters and it's fucking miserable as dos

1211
00:51:52,581 --> 00:51:53,450
Santos.
I'm a fucking.

1212
00:51:53,451 --> 00:51:54,650
Never been saying,
well,

1213
00:51:54,651 --> 00:51:57,170
three rounds with game.
If your Cardio's nice,

1214
00:51:57,171 --> 00:51:59,270
then you can deal with it.
You're going to get through it,

1215
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,220
but five,
he's going to fucking break you.

1216
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:02,450
But is it the same kane?

1217
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:05,720
And if it is the same Kane,
if cane comes back and he's 100 percent

1218
00:52:05,721 --> 00:52:08,300
healthy and he's making that mad run
towards that title,

1219
00:52:08,301 --> 00:52:10,670
belting it's easy fight for them.
It becomes very interesting.

1220
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,380
Yeah.
Then you're talking about a different

1221
00:52:12,381 --> 00:52:13,580
animal.
The cain,

1222
00:52:13,581 --> 00:52:14,840
Cain,
Cain,

1223
00:52:14,841 --> 00:52:17,930
cain in his prime cane.
Like second fight with junior dos

1224
00:52:17,931 --> 00:52:20,420
Santos,
the Ben Rothwell fight like some of the

1225
00:52:20,421 --> 00:52:22,160
other fights that he had.
And he's a monster.

1226
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:23,570
I mean,
I still maintain.

1227
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:28,970
It's really between him and fader.
It's between him and a prime time pride

1228
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,040
fader.
And a lot of people go with prime time

1229
00:52:31,041 --> 00:52:33,180
pride.
Fate or now you know,

1230
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:35,420
for doom in there,
you certainly do.

1231
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,030
You look at his when you certainly do.
He also beat King.

1232
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:39,260
Yup.
He beat,

1233
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:44,060
he beat,
he beat fade or he beat Cain.

1234
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:46,970
He submitted,
um,

1235
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,390
Minataro.
I mean submitted it frank.

1236
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:50,473
Yeah,
that's right.

1237
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:51,440
Yeah.
But that,

1238
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:52,280
you know,
it's,

1239
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:55,100
it's funny how if he never fought steep
bay,

1240
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:58,970
you would say like,
Verdugo has emerged as one of the

1241
00:52:58,971 --> 00:53:01,970
greatest heavyweights of all time,
but he makes us mad.

1242
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,840
Crazy.
Run at steep a like charges Adam.

1243
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:08,970
That's that emotional,
crazy steep.

1244
00:53:08,971 --> 00:53:10,680
It was like,
hold up what debate is,

1245
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:13,350
but what a beautiful sun the firehouse
son

1246
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:19,700
enjoy Brazil
and the way he hit a moving away,

1247
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,680
he was like,
what do you do it?

1248
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:25,890
But boom,
like if you're coming into my shot.

1249
00:53:25,891 --> 00:53:26,030
Yeah,

1250
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:27,750
it was crazy.
Um,

1251
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:30,630
how about uh,
Misha Tate Amended Nunez?

1252
00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:33,930
That's an interesting one.
That's a very interesting fight.

1253
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:37,440
My think about Nunez,
my concern is her cardio,

1254
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:40,350
she comes out like a Bat Outta hell.
She'd certainly does.

1255
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:45,440
And she's danger Russ as fuck.
But misha tate is as game as they come.

1256
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:49,680
You know what the problem is though,
mischa's a slow starter,

1257
00:53:49,681 --> 00:53:51,750
like she always gets in trouble and
comes back.

1258
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:55,770
But with Nunez she hits so fucking hard.
If you're a slow starter that first

1259
00:53:55,771 --> 00:53:58,380
round you're going to have to weatherman
by that first round.

1260
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:01,450
Tate wins and honestly for.
And I know people hate on it,

1261
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:04,380
but for the,
for the business tastes so good for the

1262
00:54:04,381 --> 00:54:05,540
sport man,
because she.

1263
00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:08,070
She looks fucking obviously she's
beautiful.

1264
00:54:08,071 --> 00:54:10,470
She speaks great and she's just a good
winter.

1265
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:12,030
You know what I'm saying?
She's articulate.

1266
00:54:12,031 --> 00:54:13,830
She's just a good winner no doubt.

1267
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:16,800
But for Brazil,
which is a huge market,

1268
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:19,800
Amanda Nunez will be Gi.
They only have one champ right now.

1269
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,530
Dos Anjos?
Yeah.

1270
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:24,000
They said fuck that testing.
God dammit.

1271
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,480
God dammit.
Really?

1272
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:27,960
We're going to do that now.
Yeah.

1273
00:54:27,961 --> 00:54:29,920
And you got to wear reebok.
Goddammit.

1274
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:32,580
Amanda Nunez.
Very interesting.

1275
00:54:32,581 --> 00:54:34,860
She means hope.
She really concentrate on cardio for

1276
00:54:34,861 --> 00:54:37,200
this camp.
That's all she should be doing.

1277
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:38,640
Yeah.
This is a five round fight to.

1278
00:54:38,641 --> 00:54:40,250
Is she ever fought a five round fight
before and.

1279
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:41,580
No Sir.
Yeah.

1280
00:54:41,581 --> 00:54:45,510
So that's interesting because cat on the
Prelim said ib both you bitches.

1281
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:46,703
Well,
you know,

1282
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:49,860
if you look at me,
she has fights like she has shown

1283
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:53,220
remarkable ability to endure punches and
kicks.

1284
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,800
Do you ever see her fight with Julia
Kedsey in strikeforce?

1285
00:54:56,310 --> 00:54:58,860
Julie Kenzie can fucking kick.
Oh yeah.

1286
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,440
She's got some beautiful kicks,
beautiful technique.

1287
00:55:01,441 --> 00:55:06,441
And she caught me with a fucking cloying
or right on the chin and a meesha fought

1288
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:09,360
it off and gutted it out and eventually
got a submission,

1289
00:55:09,361 --> 00:55:10,290
which is,
you're not,

1290
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:11,940
you're not fighting off the Nunez.

1291
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,760
Straight Punch to the face though.
She hits so fucking hard.

1292
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:16,600
She gets so hard.
I think that would be troubled,

1293
00:55:16,601 --> 00:55:17,490
man.
But do you think she,

1294
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:20,700
she punches his heart as Julie Kicks.
I say no fucking way.

1295
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:21,830
Do you ever see that?
Five,

1296
00:55:21,850 --> 00:55:22,920
five years ago.
So that's true.

1297
00:55:23,830 --> 00:55:26,240
That's after Ronda beat her.
Then that was her next fight.

1298
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:27,450
Somebody put up a,
um,

1299
00:55:27,510 --> 00:55:32,510
a highlight clip the other day of a
Julie Kenzie's kicks versus Misha Tate

1300
00:55:33,350 --> 00:55:35,460
cv could pull that up just where you go
wash your skin,

1301
00:55:35,461 --> 00:55:37,380
blasted in the face.
But there's this one,

1302
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:39,540
she,
she got blasted a couple of times with

1303
00:55:39,541 --> 00:55:40,650
good,
good kicks,

1304
00:55:40,651 --> 00:55:43,110
like she hit it with a good front leg
side kick,

1305
00:55:43,111 --> 00:55:46,660
like I'm not totally sideways but like
Thai style to the,

1306
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:51,330
to the chest center flying.
But there was this one high kick that

1307
00:55:51,331 --> 00:55:54,390
she caught her just perfect.
He says just,

1308
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:57,720
it's interesting because you see her,
she's so soft spoken.

1309
00:55:57,990 --> 00:55:59,520
She's pretty,
you know,

1310
00:55:59,521 --> 00:56:00,980
you just wouldn't.
It does.

1311
00:56:00,981 --> 00:56:03,930
There's no indications of how mentally
tough she is.

1312
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:07,960
She is tough as they come off as a
beast.

1313
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:09,880
Yeah.
You know,

1314
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:11,370
it's crazy to me,
as I was looking at this,

1315
00:56:11,371 --> 00:56:11,821
I'm like,
God,

1316
00:56:11,821 --> 00:56:13,830
who's beat them?
I looked up a b,

1317
00:56:13,831 --> 00:56:17,520
both of them and stopped.
Both of them are cats of monster cats.

1318
00:56:17,521 --> 00:56:19,440
Ferocious who camp.
Yeah,

1319
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:21,360
she's ferocious alliance going to San
Diego.

1320
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:24,110
She was at our show in Denver was awhile
ago,

1321
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,860
the firing kid live show and she was in
the back and she's like,

1322
00:56:26,861 --> 00:56:30,180
I'm thinking about moving and you're
talking to her in the same camp.

1323
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,170
I tore some cat.
If you're already thinking that it's

1324
00:56:32,171 --> 00:56:35,140
time to go because you're,
you're in this routine here,

1325
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:38,860
you know her husband committed suicide,
you have all this negative energy here,

1326
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:42,130
leave monster,
you'll be fine wherever you're at,

1327
00:56:42,310 --> 00:56:44,020
but you go got alliance,
they have monster down.

1328
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:46,990
That can really help you out.
You start a new chapter.

1329
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:50,560
It'll be like Eric del Fierro is the
unsung hero in mma.

1330
00:56:50,590 --> 00:56:54,580
Him and Mark Henry,
him and Mark Henry to the unsung heroes

1331
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:57,520
in mma who were like elite,
top of the food chain,

1332
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:02,000
world class coaches that don't
necessarily get the spotlight that they

1333
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:04,870
deserve,
and also dominick Cruz who's been

1334
00:57:04,871 --> 00:57:08,590
helping cat quite a bit.
Did you find a video dude?

1335
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:10,900
How about just the kicks?
I found the fight a few times,

1336
00:57:10,901 --> 00:57:13,770
but not had the last round.
There was no,

1337
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,060
it was on twitter.
Somebody posted it up on twitter the

1338
00:57:16,061 --> 00:57:16,960
other day.
Dude,

1339
00:57:16,961 --> 00:57:20,020
how bad I was in this.
A goat cart thing with Jason Ellis and

1340
00:57:20,021 --> 00:57:21,230
Dominick Cruz is there.
You're,

1341
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:23,470
you're competitive.
You're wasting fucking go carts.

1342
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:27,400
I see Dominic Cruz in the corner hyping
himself up debts here.

1343
00:57:27,401 --> 00:57:29,170
It's gone.
They don't want you to win.

1344
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:31,570
They don't want you to win this.

1345
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,040
He's talking to himself,
oh my God.

1346
00:57:33,041 --> 00:57:33,731
And I'm like,
Oh,

1347
00:57:33,731 --> 00:57:34,990
this is love.
It was crazy.

1348
00:57:34,991 --> 00:57:36,820
He's playing for keeps and this guy
makes them.

1349
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:38,410
He goes,
the guy who works there,

1350
00:57:38,510 --> 00:57:40,630
it's like some Costco fucking warehouse
thing.

1351
00:57:40,631 --> 00:57:41,770
They set up.
He goes,

1352
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:44,150
fucking crazy.
And I went,

1353
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:47,080
I guess man,
that's why he's world champ.

1354
00:57:47,081 --> 00:57:51,040
I tell Dick Jokes and work at Costco
because we think this is a game.

1355
00:57:51,041 --> 00:57:55,780
He doesn't brother.
One second.

1356
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:57,460
Yeah,
that's hilarious.

1357
00:57:57,490 --> 00:57:59,270
They don't want you to win.
I was like curious.

1358
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:00,930
Okay.
But yeah,

1359
00:58:01,170 --> 00:58:05,440
but restart.
Restart that could watch this.

1360
00:58:05,441 --> 00:58:06,970
Look at this.
Here's the sidekick.

1361
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:08,980
Well that was no power.
Yeah,

1362
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:11,800
but wait a minute.
There's the sidekick to the chest.

1363
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:13,810
See how she's got it.
Like sort of Thai style.

1364
00:58:13,811 --> 00:58:17,350
It's almost like a butt sweat.
This leg kick.

1365
00:58:17,770 --> 00:58:19,180
Very nice.
But now here it comes.

1366
00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:20,230
Here's the clanger.

1367
00:58:23,730 --> 00:58:24,430
I mean,
come on.

1368
00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:28,810
How many people survived that?
That is a calling or a clanger to the

1369
00:58:28,811 --> 00:58:32,440
mug and Julie Carter with a punch.
And to think that not only did she

1370
00:58:32,441 --> 00:58:36,250
survive this,
but she went on to win by submission.

1371
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:38,170
That's a woman's bat to the face
basically.

1372
00:58:38,171 --> 00:58:40,840
What?
That is just amazing.

1373
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,770
Now Meesha,
she's as good as they come in for her to

1374
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:46,300
keep one.
It's so good for,

1375
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:47,930
for the women's division.
Yeah.

1376
00:58:47,950 --> 00:58:51,880
It's so fucking good.
Well really the rematch with her and

1377
00:58:51,881 --> 00:58:55,690
Rhonda is the fucking fight.
That's the fight.

1378
00:58:55,691 --> 00:58:58,960
And even more so than holly and Ronda
because they,

1379
00:58:59,050 --> 00:59:01,720
there's so much animosity might
disagree.

1380
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:04,360
Well because me,
she just choked Talia unconscious.

1381
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:08,450
I know.
But I think that that,

1382
00:59:08,470 --> 00:59:12,400
that Holly Rhonda rematch is way bigger
because we've never seen Ronnie just get

1383
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:15,340
fucking Mert and dismantling that is
true.

1384
00:59:15,370 --> 00:59:17,710
And now she and she was talking about
suicide and she's been out of the

1385
00:59:17,711 --> 00:59:20,260
spotlight.
She came back and now she's facing that

1386
00:59:20,261 --> 00:59:21,290
same flow.
It's like,

1387
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,540
oh fuck.

1388
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,590
And she beats her.
Oh my God.

1389
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:27,380
Or She just never comes back.
Well you don't know.

1390
00:59:27,381 --> 00:59:29,180
I mean she just got through knee
surgery.

1391
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:32,320
So that's always an issue,
you know,

1392
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:33,920
you know,
how long,

1393
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:36,590
what's the extent,
the extent of the damage,

1394
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:40,130
like what did she get taken care of?
I believe she had meniscus issues,

1395
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:41,960
which is not the worst thing in the
world.

1396
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:43,880
The best of all of them.
Yeah.

1397
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,240
Well especially if you can get stem cell
shots in there,

1398
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:49,750
which I'm sure she probably did.
Um,

1399
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,590
so there's that.
So,

1400
00:59:51,591 --> 00:59:53,690
you know,
maybe she comes back and maybe she's got

1401
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:57,590
more mobility and more,
more agility than ever because of taking

1402
00:59:57,591 --> 00:59:59,180
care of an issue that's been bothering
her.

1403
00:59:59,181 --> 01:00:01,040
You know,
this as much as anybody bothering her

1404
01:00:01,041 --> 01:00:02,690
for years maybe.
Maybe.

1405
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:03,920
Oh,
it's just doesn't give a fuck about

1406
01:00:03,921 --> 01:00:04,611
fighting him.
Yeah,

1407
01:00:04,611 --> 01:00:05,330
there's that too.

1408
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:07,400
I mean,
when you lose in such a devastating

1409
01:00:07,401 --> 01:00:11,540
fashion like that and then take a long
time off of it mean she without a doubt

1410
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:16,541
has a warrior and a winner's mindset.
But for how long,

1411
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,170
you know,
I mean,

1412
01:00:18,171 --> 01:00:20,000
does she,
she still want to do it that she.

1413
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:22,220
Did she want to jump right back in the
way?

1414
01:00:22,221 --> 01:00:25,010
Holly wanted to jump right back in?
Yeah.

1415
01:00:25,170 --> 01:00:26,480
I'm,
I'm always weird comment,

1416
01:00:26,550 --> 01:00:28,880
the only thing that was a little strange
was

1417
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:35,240
as the face of women's MMA and you lose
one fight and saying how you had

1418
01:00:35,241 --> 01:00:38,930
suicidal thoughts and talking about
don't be a do nothing bitch,

1419
01:00:38,931 --> 01:00:40,490
and the first thing you want to do,
you know what I'm saying?

1420
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:43,430
And then as soon as,
as soon as it doesn't go your way,

1421
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:44,840
like fuck this man,
I'm out.

1422
01:00:44,930 --> 01:00:47,060
It's like,
well that's not a champion.

1423
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:47,930
You can't do that.

1424
01:00:48,110 --> 01:00:51,530
Well he was doing movies her.
It wasn't like she just said,

1425
01:00:51,531 --> 01:00:52,700
fuck you.
I'm out.

1426
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:53,400
I'm not,
you know,

1427
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,590
I'm done with this.
She had two movie set up,

1428
01:00:55,591 --> 01:00:58,550
one of them being a remake of roadhouse.
It's a big movie.

1429
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:01,400
So craziness to hold the whole thing is
a big craziness.

1430
01:01:01,401 --> 01:01:02,870
Right.
So she's got,

1431
01:01:03,050 --> 01:01:06,140
she's got these two movies,
she's got the knee surgery,

1432
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:08,480
she's got love.
Yeah man.

1433
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:10,220
It's a lot going on.
Lot going on,

1434
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:12,350
but as long as,
as long as she's happy,

1435
01:01:12,351 --> 01:01:13,700
she doesn't own anyone,
anyone,

1436
01:01:13,701 --> 01:01:16,130
anything.
Like she could just rather than sunset

1437
01:01:16,131 --> 01:01:18,080
and make all these movies and be like,
fuck it man.

1438
01:01:18,081 --> 01:01:20,540
What I did for the,
she's good now what she did for the

1439
01:01:20,541 --> 01:01:22,760
sport,
she sat for women's fighting,

1440
01:01:22,790 --> 01:01:25,610
but do you think that she would ever be
happy going out with a loss like that?

1441
01:01:25,970 --> 01:01:27,510
That's the,
the issue that see that.

1442
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:29,660
That's for her to answer.
That's tough man.

1443
01:01:29,661 --> 01:01:30,770
And then there's also,
you know,

1444
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:34,220
she has the Holly Holm lost,
she needs to redeem and then now you got

1445
01:01:34,221 --> 01:01:36,400
sideboard in that bitch and that's the
super fight.

1446
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:37,080
Everyone.
Let's see.

1447
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:39,860
Cyborg is like,
let's go chomping at the fucking bit.

1448
01:01:40,010 --> 01:01:41,780
So while you're making movies,
sideboard,

1449
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:44,690
sit in this fucking speed bag.
Like at their job,

1450
01:01:44,691 --> 01:01:48,120
which it is night and day,
just waiting for us to get upset.

1451
01:01:48,270 --> 01:01:50,000
You know what I'm saying?
So it's tough man.

1452
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:52,340
But I think what's crazy to me is,
you know,

1453
01:01:52,341 --> 01:01:55,010
when cyberworks coming out me,
she's one of the only girls who was

1454
01:01:55,011 --> 01:01:57,500
like,
I'll fight her fucking nuts.

1455
01:01:57,550 --> 01:01:58,071
Yeah.
What else?

1456
01:01:58,071 --> 01:02:00,560
Wanted to find a mistake saying that now
she's the other title.

1457
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:04,010
Well,
but not at that 35 should do it.

1458
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:05,300
Yeah.
At 35.

1459
01:02:05,390 --> 01:02:06,400
You're the champ.
Yeah.

1460
01:02:06,650 --> 01:02:07,483
Fuck you.

1461
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:08,480
Yeah.
From invicta.

1462
01:02:08,510 --> 01:02:09,600
Why do I give a fuck?
What's me?

1463
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:10,070
You?
No,

1464
01:02:10,070 --> 01:02:12,230
you Misha tate.
Meet me.

1465
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:13,640
You're the one who needs this.
I don't.

1466
01:02:13,670 --> 01:02:17,880
I wonder if she can make 1:35.
I mean she made 1:42.

1467
01:02:17,881 --> 01:02:20,220
Did Not look good when she was at the
way in.

1468
01:02:20,221 --> 01:02:23,130
I mean she looks like skeletor 35 going
to be tough.

1469
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:26,880
But if you want those big money fights.
But look,

1470
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:32,180
here's the bottom line with Christian
bale made 1:10 when he was in that

1471
01:02:33,121 --> 01:02:36,030
stupid fucking movie.
He's the on stupid talking about Dallas

1472
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:36,841
buyers club.
No,

1473
01:02:36,841 --> 01:02:38,350
not that one.
That was um.

1474
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:39,360
Oh,
matthew mcconaughey.

1475
01:02:39,450 --> 01:02:41,830
That's right.
But he also made like 97 pounds.

1476
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:43,200
Yeah,
straight dad.

1477
01:02:43,201 --> 01:02:47,230
Christian Bale's was in a stupid movie
that nobody watched called the machine.

1478
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:50,580
He almost died.
He almost died.

1479
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:52,340
You've seen that,
right?

1480
01:02:52,650 --> 01:02:54,980
I've seen pictures of him getting there.
Yeah.

1481
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:56,960
Mikaila.
He fucked his body up doing that.

1482
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,680
I'm sure he did.
He said he's never been to say,

1483
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:00,870
oh fuck sakes.
Yeah.

1484
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,690
Matthew mcconaughey.
He said he'd never been the same again.

1485
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:04,321
Yeah,
he goes,

1486
01:03:04,321 --> 01:03:04,921
I.
He goes,

1487
01:03:04,921 --> 01:03:06,960
I was doing it naturally.
He was doing,

1488
01:03:06,970 --> 01:03:08,760
this is the center for Das bicycling.
He goes,

1489
01:03:08,761 --> 01:03:10,310
yeah man,
I was losing all this weight and you get

1490
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:13,040
to a certain point where my diet,
I just couldn't lose anymore.

1491
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:16,170
It didn't look like edades ridiculous.
He goes,

1492
01:03:16,171 --> 01:03:19,660
then I know he didn't say why he took me
was then I had to do some aftermarket

1493
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:22,220
shit to get even lower and bigger.
You read.

1494
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:23,250
He was always like your big,
strong.

1495
01:03:23,290 --> 01:03:24,330
He's like,
I've never been the same.

1496
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:27,330
My body never came back the same ever.
Yeah,

1497
01:03:27,390 --> 01:03:29,790
especially like Matthew mcconaughey.
He's in his forties,

1498
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:32,550
so you start doing that to your body
when you're in your forties and just

1499
01:03:32,551 --> 01:03:36,510
wreck it and you know your testosterone
levels are low diversity system.

1500
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:41,310
It devastates your endocrine system.
Have you ever seen like there he is.

1501
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:42,720
Jesus Christ.
He looked bad.

1502
01:03:42,770 --> 01:03:44,670
That diamond piece before now look.
Yeah,

1503
01:03:44,730 --> 01:03:47,370
it looks like tales from the crypt.
Mad Mike or Magic.

1504
01:03:47,371 --> 01:03:52,110
Mike mentioned my to
look at them though.

1505
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:55,350
Talk about being both deepen,
hacked in God.

1506
01:03:55,410 --> 01:03:59,340
Look out batty locked motherfucker.
Take his aids.

1507
01:03:59,610 --> 01:04:02,400
He must have felt like you had a good
movie too.

1508
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,410
It was a good movie.
Yeah.

1509
01:04:04,411 --> 01:04:06,270
He fucking sold me magic.
Mike,

1510
01:04:06,271 --> 01:04:07,320
you're talking about.
Fuck.

1511
01:04:07,321 --> 01:04:09,720
No,
just kidding.

1512
01:04:09,721 --> 01:04:11,310
That's not bad either.
But uh,

1513
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:15,000
the thing is like girls who do those,
you know,

1514
01:04:15,001 --> 01:04:16,860
those figure competitions cut all that
way.

1515
01:04:16,890 --> 01:04:19,860
Yes.
My Buddy's girlfriend did that and my

1516
01:04:19,861 --> 01:04:21,540
brother's wife did that.
They never,

1517
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:26,040
they never go back to the same man.
They just don't like their thyroid.

1518
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:28,920
Everything's all fucked up on them
because they lose all this weight.

1519
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:30,630
Yeah.
And then the body was in.

1520
01:04:30,631 --> 01:04:32,730
Their hormones are all fucked up.
It's a nightmare,

1521
01:04:32,731 --> 01:04:34,860
man.
To get down that low.

1522
01:04:34,861 --> 01:04:35,970
Your body's like,
what do you do?

1523
01:04:35,971 --> 01:04:37,290
Especially for a woman,
right?

1524
01:04:37,291 --> 01:04:40,470
Because body fats are usually higher for
women than there are for men,

1525
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:42,650
but it's got to be the same for men too.
Guys.

1526
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:45,420
Bodybuilders and they get down to that
shredded three percent.

1527
01:04:45,421 --> 01:04:47,130
Body fat.
We see everything.

1528
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:50,270
Strike patients.
So when you're doing it just for other

1529
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:53,250
day,
meanwhile you're covered with tanning

1530
01:04:53,251 --> 01:04:55,110
solution.
That orange,

1531
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:58,030
black basically with buck because
someone's like,

1532
01:04:58,031 --> 01:04:59,700
God,
that black garlic shredded and I'm white

1533
01:04:59,701 --> 01:05:01,230
as fuck.
I thought I get black.

1534
01:05:01,350 --> 01:05:02,680
How weird is that?
It's true.

1535
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:03,240
Muscles.
Look,

1536
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:04,890
they look.
They pop more when you're dark.

1537
01:05:04,891 --> 01:05:06,360
Yeah.
Well you could see him better.

1538
01:05:06,510 --> 01:05:08,430
It's so weird.
It's like a white car.

1539
01:05:08,431 --> 01:05:12,410
It doesn't show the line.
Get this.

1540
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:15,300
Just a meat heads at Gold's gym.
I used to work out there all the time,

1541
01:05:15,301 --> 01:05:17,850
but I saw a video of John Claude van
Damme saying,

1542
01:05:17,870 --> 01:05:18,460
no,

1543
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:20,960
kicking is bullshit and doc and he can
help guys.

1544
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:23,230
You see that?
Come on Bro.

1545
01:05:23,650 --> 01:05:25,360
Come on.
And I love John.

1546
01:05:25,870 --> 01:05:27,200
I love John.
Well,

1547
01:05:27,201 --> 01:05:30,760
you know how crazy John Claude van Damme
was right about making blockbuster

1548
01:05:30,761 --> 01:05:33,700
movies.
That's hasn't been crazy about that for

1549
01:05:33,701 --> 01:05:35,980
a long time.
How have you seen.

1550
01:05:35,981 --> 01:05:39,010
Have you seen any of his reality show?
But yeah,

1551
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:44,040
he was a drunk.
He had a great reality show on showtime.

1552
01:05:45,070 --> 01:05:46,420
Was it?
It was on showtime,

1553
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:48,980
Jvc,
D Jakes,

1554
01:05:49,010 --> 01:05:51,100
cbd.
I know that's a movie.

1555
01:05:51,170 --> 01:05:51,910
No,
no.

1556
01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:55,990
They put it on showtime for like a week.
Really dumb is flat as shown in his

1557
01:05:55,991 --> 01:05:56,920
house.
His wife.

1558
01:05:56,970 --> 01:05:57,341
Yeah.
Yeah,

1559
01:05:57,341 --> 01:06:00,970
yeah.
I'm going to have to fight again for the

1560
01:06:00,971 --> 01:06:03,970
children because I called behind closed
doors.

1561
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:05,950
That's what it's called,
but there's a.

1562
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:09,910
there's one scene with several times
where he indicates he's gonna fight.

1563
01:06:09,911 --> 01:06:14,911
This guy from Thailand who was wanting
to Olympic gold medalist in boxing and

1564
01:06:15,761 --> 01:06:20,050
he sets this fight up and he's like,
I'm running around doing all the cocaine

1565
01:06:20,051 --> 01:06:23,350
and all of this and I'll have to show
the children that I can get back and I

1566
01:06:23,351 --> 01:06:25,370
have to fight road.

1567
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:29,530
So he has like all these press
conferences set up for him and this guy

1568
01:06:29,531 --> 01:06:32,400
are squaring off.
What the fuck?

1569
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:34,270
I never saw that.
I saw JC.

1570
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:37,960
Here's a show behind closed doors.
By the way,

1571
01:06:38,190 --> 01:06:41,140
this,
this is from like seven or eight years

1572
01:06:41,141 --> 01:06:42,460
ago.
No,

1573
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:43,510
I,
I saw this.

1574
01:06:43,511 --> 01:06:45,460
I didn't see that episode that you're
talking about though.

1575
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:47,890
I've seen this bullshit.
He's up.

1576
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:51,190
He's still pulling some numbers though.
Like he's flying private.

1577
01:06:51,191 --> 01:06:56,191
Has this sick ass crib and I don't know
story.

1578
01:06:57,830 --> 01:07:02,830
They just don't fucking,
just like it hardy into hot cocoa.

1579
01:07:04,090 --> 01:07:09,090
He knows he's riding that Bolivia
marching powder right off sunset.

1580
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:14,540
That age is the fuck Outta here dude.
He looks every bit of 60.

1581
01:07:14,561 --> 01:07:16,270
I don't know what he is,
but as soon as the eighties,

1582
01:07:16,271 --> 01:07:17,780
I think fuck.
And he had.

1583
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:24,040
He had some surgery to fucking picture.
Where's this?

1584
01:07:24,730 --> 01:07:29,730
You can see the Dick route
right up to the top of those lines are

1585
01:07:31,310 --> 01:07:32,320
fucked out.
They're like,

1586
01:07:32,321 --> 01:07:33,820
what are we doing?
Why is he holding up?

1587
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:36,740
Look at the picture above that though,
where it looks like the joker that,

1588
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:39,210
oh my God damn.
Is that real?

1589
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:42,070
And that's makeup he has makeup on.
Oh my God.

1590
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:44,110
Holy Fuck.
Wow.

1591
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:45,640
But that's cocaine,
man.

1592
01:07:45,910 --> 01:07:47,620
Cocaine.
Just does that.

1593
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:49,770
Cocaine and bad life decisions.
Yeah.

1594
01:07:49,810 --> 01:07:51,310
I mean,
how old is Sean Claude Van Damme?

1595
01:07:51,311 --> 01:07:55,000
Let's take a guess.
I say 55.

1596
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:57,820
Does that make sense?
I'll say God damn,

1597
01:07:57,821 --> 01:08:00,880
if he's 50 he likes.
So he's the most shot out.

1598
01:08:00,881 --> 01:08:02,460
Fifty five year old.
I'm gonna.

1599
01:08:02,530 --> 01:08:03,820
Look,
I'm going to say 58.

1600
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,410
Fifty 5:00 AM,
right?

1601
01:08:05,470 --> 01:08:06,740
Fuck.
Look at that.

1602
01:08:07,540 --> 01:08:11,860
That's insane.
Because Tom Cruise is probably like 52

1603
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:15,230
and Tom Cruise looks sensation or
whether you're talking about

1604
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:16,010
scientology,

1605
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:17,330
she didn't know what it is.
They're helping them.

1606
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:22,280
Hydrated judges.
Just rub it in there.

1607
01:08:22,310 --> 01:08:24,830
Look,
he's 54 for the same age,

1608
01:08:25,430 --> 01:08:28,670
they're the same age,
one year difference.

1609
01:08:28,820 --> 01:08:32,840
And look how fucking stunning this dime
piece is killing the game.

1610
01:08:32,841 --> 01:08:34,640
There's a big difference there,
man.

1611
01:08:34,641 --> 01:08:37,220
That is a big difference.
He's also never been hit in the face

1612
01:08:37,221 --> 01:08:38,210
before.
That's true.

1613
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:39,440
But neither is wrong.
Claude van Damme.

1614
01:08:39,470 --> 01:08:42,470
So dear you sir.
He has a kickboxing record.

1615
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:43,333
No,
he does not.

1616
01:08:43,810 --> 01:08:47,030
Point karate.
Fighting backgrounds and kickboxing.

1617
01:08:47,730 --> 01:08:50,180
Jamie,
I don't buy it.

1618
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:52,850
How do you know?
I don't think so.

1619
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,100
I think he might've fought some point
karate tournaments.

1620
01:08:55,101 --> 01:08:56,870
I really don't think he.
He kicked boxed.

1621
01:08:57,020 --> 01:08:59,960
You think you just mark them if you guys
owe me and him?

1622
01:08:59,990 --> 01:09:02,000
Yeah.
Well what are we do when we do an MMA?

1623
01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:03,790
Are we doing straight up fight?
Oh,

1624
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:04,520
kickboxing.

1625
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:06,080
Yeah.
I don't think he has any power.

1626
01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:11,060
Eighteen and one that's not necessarily
true.

1627
01:09:11,330 --> 01:09:13,930
Well,
let's see.

1628
01:09:13,931 --> 01:09:18,380
There's a fought on tape.
See this as a karate fight,

1629
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:20,120
right?
Or is this a kickboxing fight?

1630
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:23,060
What is this?
Nineteen,

1631
01:09:23,061 --> 01:09:24,950
79.
Fight on tape.

1632
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:28,690
Let's say caught on tape.
Okay.

1633
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:30,830
What is this?
What is this?

1634
01:09:30,831 --> 01:09:34,040
This is point fighting.
Fuck fuckers fluid though.

1635
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:37,220
Yeah,
I mean he was just got tagged gold.

1636
01:09:37,550 --> 01:09:39,650
Gold.
You always holding the trophy.

1637
01:09:39,651 --> 01:09:40,610
Yeah,
I mean look,

1638
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:45,940
he most likely had some form of
competition experience,

1639
01:09:46,761 --> 01:09:49,460
but was he 18 and one in kickboxing for
real?

1640
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:54,650
I don't know.
Eighteen one means you got to fight for

1641
01:09:54,651 --> 01:09:55,310
it.
Look,

1642
01:09:55,310 --> 01:09:57,830
most people don't have more than four
fights in a year.

1643
01:09:58,070 --> 01:09:59,990
So you're fighting for a long period of
time.

1644
01:10:00,050 --> 01:10:02,480
Did that say pro?
No,

1645
01:10:02,690 --> 01:10:05,740
just said 18 and one kick because back
then it could be an amateur because you

1646
01:10:05,741 --> 01:10:07,770
know smokers are just blowing through
it.

1647
01:10:07,790 --> 01:10:08,511
Yeah,
look,

1648
01:10:08,511 --> 01:10:10,710
it's possible.
I'm not saying I believe that I want to

1649
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:14,600
believe it because he's one of my hair.
No doubt the guy had some pretty kicks,

1650
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:19,670
but the problem with the way he kicks,
he's like got like point kicks.

1651
01:10:19,770 --> 01:10:21,070
Like flippy.
Yeah.

1652
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:22,730
They're like flipkey,
flipkey kicks,

1653
01:10:22,850 --> 01:10:27,290
kickboxing and full contact karate
career began to fullcontact current 77.

1654
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:29,450
Wow.
Seventy seven.

1655
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:32,630
Hold on a second.
That would mean he would be like,

1656
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:35,180
how old was he?
Like 18.

1657
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:40,360
Okay.
I'm a little bullshit.

1658
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:45,200
Eighteen knockouts and one defeat.
He was even named Mr Belgium in a

1659
01:10:45,201 --> 01:10:48,290
bodybuilding competition in the game.

1660
01:10:53,710 --> 01:10:57,410
I mean,
maybe here's the guy winning just since

1661
01:10:57,411 --> 01:11:00,500
2009 v Van Dams in planning to make a
comeback,

1662
01:11:00,501 --> 01:11:04,610
fight to fight former box Olympic gold
medalists.

1663
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:06,530
Some luck.
Cam Singh,

1664
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:10,760
who is a tie.
I'm boxing champion.

1665
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:15,000
The fight was a focal point of the ITV
reality show.

1666
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:17,880
John Claude van Damme,
behind closed doors.

1667
01:11:18,030 --> 01:11:23,030
The fight has been repeatedly postpone
which many critics doubting it will

1668
01:11:24,121 --> 01:11:25,340
occur.
I don't know why they would doubt at

1669
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:28,930
this point,
especially to reach out to the gym.

1670
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:33,070
The difficulty of booking the venue.
Oh yeah,

1671
01:11:33,410 --> 01:11:34,980
because that's hard.
In Thailand.

1672
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:37,560
There's six year olds fighting every
fucking Tuesday.

1673
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:39,060
I mean,
look at this.

1674
01:11:39,061 --> 01:11:41,910
In December 2012,
Van Damme was seen as a part of Cam

1675
01:11:41,911 --> 01:11:45,890
sings ring crew.
When cam seeing fought against Jon hawed

1676
01:11:45,980 --> 01:11:48,960
a con and say that guy's name,
chuck cluck,

1677
01:11:48,961 --> 01:11:49,794
cluck,
cluck,

1678
01:11:49,810 --> 01:11:54,810
cluck left us.
Say that name K I a t a d I s a k,

1679
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:01,490
l a this Zach.

1680
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:05,190
Anyway,
colorful name maybe.

1681
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:08,940
I mean maybe he had some legit
kickboxing fights.

1682
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:14,160
That sounds like some world association
of kickboxing organizations that one of

1683
01:12:15,061 --> 01:12:18,600
the problems with kickboxing,
there's some callen shit.

1684
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:21,510
Yeah,
same shit.

1685
01:12:21,890 --> 01:12:22,920
Oh No,
master Kim.

1686
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:27,660
One of the problems with kickboxing is
there's a lot of world championship

1687
01:12:27,661 --> 01:12:30,870
organizations a lot.
Whereas like say if you and me started

1688
01:12:30,871 --> 01:12:32,220
up our own organization said,
hey,

1689
01:12:32,221 --> 01:12:33,840
you know Brendan,
I've been thinking,

1690
01:12:33,841 --> 01:12:35,500
man,
you and I should do a fucking

1691
01:12:35,550 --> 01:12:37,340
collaboration.
We're going to do a kickboxer

1692
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:39,630
organizations.
We're going to have the fighter and the

1693
01:12:39,631 --> 01:12:43,290
kid slash J R,
e world championship kickboxing matches,

1694
01:12:43,291 --> 01:12:46,850
and then we would just crown some dude
world champion and we don't really have.

1695
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:49,900
It's not like the WBC for boxing.
No,

1696
01:12:49,901 --> 01:12:52,600
it's not lifted the UFC for mma.
It's just like my.

1697
01:12:52,630 --> 01:12:55,140
Those tons.
I don't know how many world

1698
01:12:55,141 --> 01:12:58,860
championships there are,
especially in United States.

1699
01:12:58,860 --> 01:13:01,140
There was a ton of them.
I know that for a fact and you go

1700
01:13:01,141 --> 01:13:02,580
worldwide,
but it's not.

1701
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:05,960
It's not like Bella tour calls their
guy,

1702
01:13:05,961 --> 01:13:10,020
the world champion like Bella tour world
title,

1703
01:13:10,530 --> 01:13:12,210
you know,
like the word of.

1704
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:16,230
Well they can't go.
They can't say the second best world

1705
01:13:16,231 --> 01:13:16,861
champ.
You know,

1706
01:13:16,861 --> 01:13:21,060
it's like God damn world champion a
world champion is a world champion.

1707
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:23,520
You know,
you could say Bella Tor champion,

1708
01:13:23,730 --> 01:13:26,880
but when you say world title,
the Beltour world title,

1709
01:13:26,881 --> 01:13:29,250
it's not the world,
but stop please.

1710
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,620
But that's fighting.
That's why.

1711
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:34,190
That's why like in the Mba,
the calves or the world champ,

1712
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:37,230
there's no one on this fucking earth
being those five guys.

1713
01:13:37,231 --> 01:13:38,210
That's true.
Higher world.

1714
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:41,730
That's NFL,
NBA world champions boxing,

1715
01:13:41,731 --> 01:13:43,410
mma.
It's like there's all this

1716
01:13:45,010 --> 01:13:48,420
chick is the world heavyweight champion.
One hundred percent.

1717
01:13:48,810 --> 01:13:51,270
Who the fuck is it?
Who else has the claim?

1718
01:13:52,230 --> 01:13:55,290
Best heavyweight MMA fighters in the
world or in the UFC?

1719
01:13:55,291 --> 01:13:57,840
No doubt about it.
Steve Bay's the best of the best.

1720
01:13:57,841 --> 01:14:00,150
He knocked out for doom.
He's the world heavyweight champ.

1721
01:14:00,151 --> 01:14:02,070
Correct?
It's the only belt that really count.

1722
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:04,500
Yeah,
that's the UFC belt really counts.

1723
01:14:04,770 --> 01:14:09,090
The only way the UFC belt is even in
contention is in some of the lighter

1724
01:14:09,091 --> 01:14:12,580
weight classes you start going like home
would happen if this guy fought that guy

1725
01:14:12,581 --> 01:14:14,470
who I disagreed,
but not even.

1726
01:14:14,471 --> 01:14:16,390
They're not even.
Not even that really.

1727
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:20,500
That's the only place I agree,
like Marlon Moraes is a very talented

1728
01:14:20,501 --> 01:14:21,370
guy,
right?

1729
01:14:21,371 --> 01:14:25,190
He's a 1:45 or right at 1:35.
One 45 or write my own Mirage,

1730
01:14:25,450 --> 01:14:28,030
but the,
the fights for a world series of

1731
01:14:28,031 --> 01:14:31,210
fighting.
He's a legit like world class fighter.

1732
01:14:31,390 --> 01:14:33,970
I see.
But this is why the UFC,

1733
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:39,020
it really only is the belt that counts
because if he fought in the UFC you

1734
01:14:39,221 --> 01:14:40,390
ain't going straight to the bell.

1735
01:14:40,420 --> 01:14:44,950
You going through the fucking ringer.
Who's who at 45 to get to that belt.

1736
01:14:45,010 --> 01:14:48,500
Which everyone did.
Which Alvarez did to memorize a.

1737
01:14:48,530 --> 01:14:49,840
was he 1:35?
Yeah.

1738
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:53,440
So he's a bantamweight,
legitimate threat to,

1739
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:56,290
in my opinion,
anybody in the UFC at 1:35.

1740
01:14:56,650 --> 01:14:59,380
I mean,
could he really hit Dominic Cruz?

1741
01:14:59,740 --> 01:15:01,390
Who the fuck knows?
But look at that guy.

1742
01:15:01,420 --> 01:15:05,320
That guy is a savage.
That's a legit world class fighter.

1743
01:15:05,350 --> 01:15:08,150
Skeptical hybels on that buddy.
He's a bad motherfucker.

1744
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:11,890
He is bad motherfucker.
That guy's super talented.

1745
01:15:12,380 --> 01:15:14,190
But unless you're in the UFC,
no one gives a.

1746
01:15:14,250 --> 01:15:17,260
nobody gives a fuck.
It's weird because you know,

1747
01:15:17,261 --> 01:15:20,080
he's,
he's one of the few guys outside the UFC

1748
01:15:20,410 --> 01:15:22,780
that like,
like just engages in other one.

1749
01:15:23,030 --> 01:15:26,440
If you guys outside the UFC where I go,
I want to see that fucking guy fight the

1750
01:15:26,441 --> 01:15:27,820
best of the best.
I mean,

1751
01:15:27,821 --> 01:15:30,250
I see like real mad potential and that
kid,

1752
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:31,350
he's another one.

1753
01:15:31,350 --> 01:15:34,720
He's the world series of fighting 50
slash 55 champion.

1754
01:15:34,721 --> 01:15:35,680
Yeah,
it's an animal.

1755
01:15:35,790 --> 01:15:37,360
Kid's a fucking animal.
He's a beast.

1756
01:15:37,361 --> 01:15:39,070
Man.
He started with us in Denver was a

1757
01:15:39,071 --> 01:15:39,790
restroom.
You,

1758
01:15:39,790 --> 01:15:41,680
UNC.
He's just a monster.

1759
01:15:41,681 --> 01:15:44,200
But again,
you look at the guys he's beating for

1760
01:15:44,201 --> 01:15:45,760
these title 100 percent.
You're right.

1761
01:15:45,790 --> 01:15:46,690
One hundred percent.
No,

1762
01:15:46,691 --> 01:15:49,360
no debate whatsoever.
And there ain't any growing either in

1763
01:15:49,361 --> 01:15:51,340
the UFC know because you come from a
world champ.

1764
01:15:51,341 --> 01:15:53,320
Look,
look at will Brooke's first fight bras.

1765
01:15:53,321 --> 01:15:54,220
Pearson?
Yup.

1766
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:55,630
Yup.
Yeah.

1767
01:15:55,631 --> 01:15:57,310
He's going right into the hot.
I mean that's,

1768
01:15:57,430 --> 01:15:59,470
that's the,
that's the nature of the beast with UFC,

1769
01:15:59,610 --> 01:16:01,820
right?
It's no different than the NBA or nfl.

1770
01:16:01,821 --> 01:16:03,280
Like you're not.
There's no easy.

1771
01:16:03,340 --> 01:16:05,530
You're not getting cakewalks and you
have this contract.

1772
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:07,760
They're paying a shitload of money.
I mean,

1773
01:16:08,740 --> 01:16:11,650
so there can be no doubt that the UFC
1:35 pounds a month,

1774
01:16:11,651 --> 01:16:13,810
55 champions are the champions of the
world,

1775
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:16,960
but there is talent in some other way
classes.

1776
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:19,210
There's talent in some other
organizations.

1777
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:22,030
We'll
get Eddie Alvarez.

1778
01:16:22,930 --> 01:16:23,681
Everyone was like,
God,

1779
01:16:23,681 --> 01:16:26,320
I want how you doing the UFC world title
now.

1780
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:30,670
He'd be the first guy with a belt or
title in UFC title and I think Chandler,

1781
01:16:30,671 --> 01:16:32,800
a guy beat him once and lost him second
time.

1782
01:16:32,801 --> 01:16:35,350
I think Chandler looks even better now.
Better than ever.

1783
01:16:35,430 --> 01:16:37,030
I mean to be knocked out,
but tricky.

1784
01:16:37,050 --> 01:16:38,710
Pippa like,
good Lord,

1785
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:41,840
he's explosive.
He's so quick with his entries and exit.

1786
01:16:41,870 --> 01:16:46,870
His footwork was fantastic and he's a
guy who was doing some pretty extensive

1787
01:16:47,830 --> 01:16:52,830
fucking camps to get ready for this
spectacular workout ethic or work ethic.

1788
01:16:53,890 --> 01:16:57,340
Where do you think.
Because a guy like a guy like chandler

1789
01:16:57,341 --> 01:16:58,660
who's just killing the game,
right?

1790
01:16:58,670 --> 01:17:03,070
Like he has a shitload of.
But this is the thing though.

1791
01:17:03,071 --> 01:17:04,200
Joe.
Let's say you're his.

1792
01:17:04,230 --> 01:17:05,620
His manager.
He's the.

1793
01:17:05,790 --> 01:17:09,770
He's the king of Bela tour.
Let's say he's pulling in small and six

1794
01:17:09,771 --> 01:17:10,130
figures

1795
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:13,100
for sure.
Sponsorship money included so high six

1796
01:17:13,101 --> 01:17:15,950
figures or per fight,
they come to the UFC strips.

1797
01:17:16,050 --> 01:17:17,810
It's going to be a different animal.
Now,

1798
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:20,840
it's true as a fighter,
no one's ever going to say you're the,

1799
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:23,540
your pound for pound best.
That's just never going to happen.

1800
01:17:23,740 --> 01:17:26,600
This just not the only way to do this is
what I think.

1801
01:17:27,050 --> 01:17:29,750
He's a champ.
Chandlers and 1:55 pound champ.

1802
01:17:29,810 --> 01:17:31,250
This is.
He's got two options.

1803
01:17:31,251 --> 01:17:34,430
Either he sticks it out with Bella and
Bella tour continues to grow.

1804
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:36,350
Um,
but even my man,

1805
01:17:36,351 --> 01:17:38,150
Jimmy Smith,
who is,

1806
01:17:38,180 --> 01:17:40,430
in my opinion,
one of the best fucking commentators in

1807
01:17:40,431 --> 01:17:44,480
the world,
they make him have to fake excitement

1808
01:17:44,481 --> 01:17:47,630
about like Ken shamrock versus Hoists
Gracie.

1809
01:17:47,870 --> 01:17:51,170
They're doing ultimate hunting.
They're not doing good moves.

1810
01:17:51,171 --> 01:17:53,060
These are not good moves.
That one was bad.

1811
01:17:53,090 --> 01:17:55,050
That's a bad move.
But you know,

1812
01:17:55,490 --> 01:17:58,220
for a guy like Jimmy Smith who was like
a legit fan,

1813
01:17:58,221 --> 01:18:01,370
as well as being an excellent
commentator,

1814
01:18:01,630 --> 01:18:04,340
like that's a bad place to be,
to have to,

1815
01:18:04,341 --> 01:18:06,200
you know,
you're making this guy have to hype up

1816
01:18:06,201 --> 01:18:07,080
some Horse Shit.

1817
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:11,090
You want that paycheck bitch get crunk
Ken shamrock hoists,

1818
01:18:11,091 --> 01:18:13,760
Gracie,
seven dot 5,000 and Kimbo.

1819
01:18:13,820 --> 01:18:16,700
It'd be crunk like Justin combat.
You better be crunk too.

1820
01:18:16,701 --> 01:18:20,030
Like it's Mike Tyson holyfield.
We've taking half your paycheck.

1821
01:18:20,050 --> 01:18:22,070
Know there's no,
there's nothing good about that.

1822
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:23,990
So I hope they don't have to do that
anymore.

1823
01:18:24,020 --> 01:18:26,810
Hopefully step away from that.
But you know,

1824
01:18:26,811 --> 01:18:30,290
like the chandler fire,
chandler could.

1825
01:18:30,380 --> 01:18:35,380
It's conceivable that if spike really
keeps pumping and keep putting it up and

1826
01:18:35,991 --> 01:18:36,824
keeps,
you know,

1827
01:18:37,010 --> 01:18:41,600
firing up the coals of promotion that
they get to a point where people start

1828
01:18:41,601 --> 01:18:44,290
mentioning Chandler alongside other
guys,

1829
01:18:44,310 --> 01:18:47,330
you to sign more guys like,
I don't know what the deal is with

1830
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:49,100
reading Mcdonald.
His contract is up.

1831
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:51,270
Granted he lost a wonderboy.
But I,

1832
01:18:51,350 --> 01:18:53,930
you know,
I know bell tours can make a strong push

1833
01:18:53,931 --> 01:18:56,690
to sign that dude.
But you got to get these free agents and

1834
01:18:56,691 --> 01:18:59,420
have a stable because right now,
you know what I'm saying?

1835
01:18:59,420 --> 01:19:00,590
We just like,
look at,

1836
01:19:00,770 --> 01:19:04,580
look at UFC $200.
What the fuck amy person on it?

1837
01:19:04,581 --> 01:19:08,660
Any tandem could fight for a main event
and belt or any night of the week.

1838
01:19:08,730 --> 01:19:09,950
Oh yeah.
Sage.

1839
01:19:09,951 --> 01:19:13,610
Northcutt could.
Sage northcutt would be fucking brock

1840
01:19:13,611 --> 01:19:15,760
lesnar over there.
The minibar.

1841
01:19:15,850 --> 01:19:16,830
That is ridiculous.
Sure.

1842
01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:20,630
It'd be a mini brock lesnar.
Did you see his comments?

1843
01:19:20,990 --> 01:19:22,090
What is.
I said the,

1844
01:19:22,220 --> 01:19:23,660
his last fight.
It was a fluke.

1845
01:19:24,350 --> 01:19:25,760
Potential death.
Not flukes son.

1846
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:27,110
That's not a fluke.
Yeah.

1847
01:19:27,111 --> 01:19:29,110
Well you're just young.
Yeah,

1848
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:30,170
he's a young kid.
I'm a fan.

1849
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:33,740
He certainly did have a strep throat
going into that fight that's been

1850
01:19:33,741 --> 01:19:34,850
documented.
And you know,

1851
01:19:34,851 --> 01:19:36,380
someone choking you while you get strep
throat.

1852
01:19:36,381 --> 01:19:37,760
You're going to tap pretty fucking
quick.

1853
01:19:38,030 --> 01:19:40,070
You have some serious inflammation in
your neck.

1854
01:19:40,071 --> 01:19:41,300
And.
But Brian,

1855
01:19:41,301 --> 01:19:45,500
Barbara arena is a fucking animal.
He's an animal.

1856
01:19:45,610 --> 01:19:46,790
All right.
You saw how he,

1857
01:19:46,791 --> 01:19:48,250
um,
he beat a.

1858
01:19:48,290 --> 01:19:49,160
what's his name?
Homeboy.

1859
01:19:49,161 --> 01:19:52,450
The Brazilian cat that was undefeated.
A.

1860
01:19:52,610 --> 01:19:53,443
God dammit.

1861
01:19:57,780 --> 01:19:59,160
God Damn it.
I can't remember his name.

1862
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:02,880
Warley.
Warley.

1863
01:20:02,881 --> 01:20:05,880
Alvez.
I beat that dude who is a beast.

1864
01:20:05,970 --> 01:20:09,330
Undefeated guy won the ultimate fighter
for Brazil.

1865
01:20:09,390 --> 01:20:10,520
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

1866
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:11,400
Worldly.
Elvis.

1867
01:20:11,910 --> 01:20:14,700
He's a beast and Barbara Barbarina beat
him in a war,

1868
01:20:15,660 --> 01:20:17,810
so can't call it a fluke.
[inaudible] CIOCCA.

1869
01:20:18,020 --> 01:20:21,000
Like getting nicked by right hand and
getting drop.

1870
01:20:21,060 --> 01:20:23,130
You can say it's a fluke.
Stylize it closed.

1871
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:25,390
I saw even a fluke.
Wanted to punch you.

1872
01:20:25,391 --> 01:20:27,400
He punched.
You can chalk that up more as a fluke.

1873
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:30,200
Then a fucking submission that was
calculated like,

1874
01:20:30,380 --> 01:20:30,781
no,
no,

1875
01:20:30,781 --> 01:20:31,050
no,
no.

1876
01:20:31,050 --> 01:20:32,850
I decided to take it down and choke you
out.

1877
01:20:32,851 --> 01:20:34,920
There's no food like I went through the
steps.

1878
01:20:35,070 --> 01:20:36,860
Choked you out.
God Damn.

1879
01:20:36,870 --> 01:20:39,300
He's fighting.
Enrique Mirin Wasabi.

1880
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:42,030
That's his nickname was obregon was
sadly spicy.

1881
01:20:42,031 --> 01:20:46,380
Like Sushi,
like the green stuff on Sushi and stuff.

1882
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:51,060
I don't know anything about Enrique.
Do nothing besides the names.

1883
01:20:51,340 --> 01:20:52,940
You have a UFC.
The

1884
01:20:55,380 --> 01:20:56,550
click on him.
Jamie.

1885
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:58,380
See if you've got a UFC record on him.

1886
01:21:00,750 --> 01:21:02,100
Bom,
Bom,

1887
01:21:02,130 --> 01:21:03,120
Bom,
Bom,

1888
01:21:03,150 --> 01:21:03,720
Bom,
bom.

1889
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:05,640
Scroll up please.
Is that as the UFC record?

1890
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:10,230
Yeah.
So he does have a split decision loss.

1891
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:11,760
Yeah.
But that's not,

1892
01:21:11,910 --> 01:21:13,170
yeah,
UFC fight night.

1893
01:21:13,830 --> 01:21:16,260
November 21st.
He uh,

1894
01:21:17,170 --> 01:21:19,470
okay.
Probably good fight for sage.

1895
01:21:19,530 --> 01:21:20,610
Yeah.
Well,

1896
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:21,990
you know what I mean.
Antibiotics,

1897
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:26,100
that's the kind of fight that he really
shouldn't be taking 100 percent guys who

1898
01:21:26,101 --> 01:21:28,110
were thrown to the wolves and build a
kid up.

1899
01:21:28,111 --> 01:21:30,840
I mean the kid's 21 years old because
even 21,

1900
01:21:30,870 --> 01:21:32,440
he's 29 slash 20.
Right.

1901
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:37,200
But for Stud,
here's the fucking sleeper that no one's

1902
01:21:37,201 --> 01:21:39,460
talking about.
Tj dillashaw how fell.

1903
01:21:39,490 --> 01:21:42,420
Sun Sail.
That's a tough fight for Tj.

1904
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:44,430
I remember.
Yeah.

1905
01:21:45,090 --> 01:21:48,570
And who won a sunset in Brazil,
but very,

1906
01:21:48,610 --> 01:21:51,320
very close.
Some people had tj winning [inaudible]

1907
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:53,940
yeah.
Tj,

1908
01:21:53,941 --> 01:21:56,730
I'm needs this fight,
this fight.

1909
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:59,580
There's a couple of guys on this car and
I'll go who really need the to win.

1910
01:21:59,580 --> 01:22:03,750
But I think
sometimes a little tank man,

1911
01:22:03,751 --> 01:22:05,040
he's a super tank.
You know,

1912
01:22:05,041 --> 01:22:07,710
Tj is the biggest favorite on this card.
Really.

1913
01:22:07,770 --> 01:22:11,700
I think four to one.
I think just because a sense I was past

1914
01:22:11,701 --> 01:22:12,391
record,
you know,

1915
01:22:12,391 --> 01:22:15,180
like what's the catch?
How much of your favorite is cane over

1916
01:22:15,181 --> 01:22:17,070
brown?
Uh,

1917
01:22:17,071 --> 01:22:18,090
I think,
uh,

1918
01:22:18,180 --> 01:22:20,430
Brown like plus 2:25,
right?

1919
01:22:20,550 --> 01:22:22,820
Huh?
We'll look at that as Jamie was Jamie

1920
01:22:22,830 --> 01:22:27,830
and with the quickness to 80,
to 90 to 90.

1921
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:31,110
See,
that's my upset pick of the night if I'm

1922
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:33,020
good at.
Yeah,

1923
01:22:33,030 --> 01:22:35,460
I could see.
I could see that being John Jones is a

1924
01:22:35,461 --> 01:22:36,720
big favorite.
Look at that.

1925
01:22:36,810 --> 01:22:37,920
That makes sense.
You know,

1926
01:22:38,670 --> 01:22:41,260
but there's a couple of people who need
wins.

1927
01:22:42,230 --> 01:22:45,870
I mean Jose Aldo and Joseph Aldo.
Man,

1928
01:22:45,871 --> 01:22:48,030
he's been gone for awhile.
He got murked by Mcgregor.

1929
01:22:48,031 --> 01:22:49,230
Tough Shit.
Kind of need to.

1930
01:22:49,231 --> 01:22:51,810
When Travis Brown,
he loses this one.

1931
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:53,333
It's tough,
man.

1932
01:22:53,870 --> 01:22:56,950
Hmm.
I'm surprised that that uh,

1933
01:22:57,060 --> 01:23:00,900
Aldo and edgar is basically dead even.
Really?

1934
01:23:01,030 --> 01:23:02,310
Who would you give it to?
Although,

1935
01:23:05,050 --> 01:23:06,220
boy,
it's

1936
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:08,740
hard.
I guess I'm not surprised because you

1937
01:23:08,741 --> 01:23:11,500
really don't fucking know.
If you go back and look at all those

1938
01:23:11,501 --> 01:23:14,950
past performances,
you look at his last fight with Chad

1939
01:23:14,950 --> 01:23:17,410
Mendez before he fight mcgregor,
before he fought mcgregor.

1940
01:23:17,590 --> 01:23:18,290
Fight.
Ever.

1941
01:23:18,290 --> 01:23:20,200
Fantastic fight.
Um,

1942
01:23:20,620 --> 01:23:21,460
I don't know,
man.

1943
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:25,000
That's a tough one to call.
It used to be even in the odds.

1944
01:23:25,060 --> 01:23:27,250
It's weird.
That's a fucking tough fight to call

1945
01:23:27,251 --> 01:23:32,251
them in and the fact that conor was able
to start something like that and frankie

1946
01:23:32,831 --> 01:23:36,300
just shows no sign of slowing down.
No,

1947
01:23:36,380 --> 01:23:41,380
that's where he is a fucking animal.
He posted videos of his workout,

1948
01:23:42,630 --> 01:23:46,960
a workout before you went to Vegas.
He's doing fucking handstands and

1949
01:23:47,230 --> 01:23:50,080
backflips and he's a monster man.
A

1950
01:23:51,730 --> 01:23:53,020
title shot.
So bad.

1951
01:23:53,021 --> 01:23:55,870
He certainly does.
I'm very curious about this fight,

1952
01:23:56,350 --> 01:23:58,600
although he's never been knocked out
like that before.

1953
01:23:58,630 --> 01:23:59,270
Nope.

1954
01:23:59,270 --> 01:24:01,750
So we've never seen how he responds.
Exactly.

1955
01:24:02,020 --> 01:24:05,080
He could just be a demon of Brazilian
demon.

1956
01:24:05,170 --> 01:24:07,510
Fucking Merck's Frankie.
It's such a good fight.

1957
01:24:07,810 --> 01:24:09,400
Well,
frank had a really hard time with his

1958
01:24:09,401 --> 01:24:11,920
leg kicks in that first fight and
really,

1959
01:24:11,921 --> 01:24:13,840
really hug.
And um,

1960
01:24:14,230 --> 01:24:17,020
this was also,
you know,

1961
01:24:17,290 --> 01:24:20,350
pre Usada true.
And also frankie,

1962
01:24:20,380 --> 01:24:23,350
he's,
he's been on a straight wind streets on

1963
01:24:23,410 --> 01:24:24,820
Merkin dudes.
Cub,

1964
01:24:24,820 --> 01:24:26,740
Swanson fight.
Just relentless Mendez.

1965
01:24:27,130 --> 01:24:29,330
Bj Penn.
Yeah.

1966
01:24:29,650 --> 01:24:31,810
Frankie has been on a tear,
You know,

1967
01:24:31,811 --> 01:24:34,900
who needs to win.
Like I'm fuck him.

1968
01:24:35,140 --> 01:24:36,580
Johnny hendricks.
He does.

1969
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:39,730
and there's not an easy fight at all.
It's a weird message.

1970
01:24:39,731 --> 01:24:44,170
Especially iF calvin comes in and shape,
especially if calvin doesn't have a hard

1971
01:24:44,171 --> 01:24:46,510
time making weight.
Calvin's a beast,

1972
01:24:46,511 --> 01:24:48,340
man.
He's a light on his feet.

1973
01:24:48,490 --> 01:24:53,490
He throws off real quick hands.
He's got great footwork and he's a

1974
01:24:53,750 --> 01:24:55,390
southpaw.
There's a very similar.

1975
01:24:55,450 --> 01:24:58,690
They're very similar,
but it's way more agile though on his

1976
01:24:58,691 --> 01:25:00,430
feet.
See way more footwork.

1977
01:25:00,850 --> 01:25:02,950
see,
I think johnny puts things together

1978
01:25:02,951 --> 01:25:06,340
better and I think I think kevin's going
to struggle with because calvin is

1979
01:25:06,341 --> 01:25:09,070
usually.
He's that grinder like ho ho wrestle.

1980
01:25:09,071 --> 01:25:11,260
You know what I'm saying?
He still those big bombs.

1981
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:14,050
Well shit.
That's johnny's fucking gay man.

1982
01:25:15,220 --> 01:25:16,300
I think.
Great fight.

1983
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:19,120
It is a great fight,
but I think calvin just needs to be

1984
01:25:19,121 --> 01:25:21,470
really,
really focused for this fight he has to.

1985
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:24,970
This is a giant important step for him.
For both of them.

1986
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,520
What happens is the giant lose this one
that's three in a row,

1987
01:25:27,521 --> 01:25:28,390
son.
Yeah.

1988
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:29,980
Yeah,
you're right.

1989
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:32,890
And this is a big one.
This is a really big one because he's,

1990
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:36,010
you know,
he's facing a young kid on the way up,

1991
01:25:36,011 --> 01:25:39,610
was not top 10 right now.
The risky fight for johnny.

1992
01:25:39,790 --> 01:25:41,350
It's weird.
There's certain fights in your career

1993
01:25:41,351 --> 01:25:43,900
where it's like a fork in the road,
man.

1994
01:25:44,020 --> 01:25:46,900
Yeah.
Where you go and it's so competitive.

1995
01:25:46,901 --> 01:25:51,490
Especially at this weight class now it's
like you lose the kelvin fuck man.

1996
01:25:51,610 --> 01:25:54,640
WeLl,
johnny's lack of mobility got exposed

1997
01:25:54,641 --> 01:25:56,980
and the wonderboy fight will fuck who's
done It.

1998
01:25:56,990 --> 01:25:57,910
Yeah.
Yeah.

1999
01:25:58,030 --> 01:26:01,120
Wonder boys just on another level when
it comes to that karate style.

2000
01:26:01,420 --> 01:26:03,170
But I also think johnny,
he was,

2001
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:05,030
you know,
he's always been on discipline outside

2002
01:26:05,031 --> 01:26:07,760
camps.
It's catching up with them now.

2003
01:26:07,761 --> 01:26:08,780
There's no,
you know,

2004
01:26:09,020 --> 01:26:10,970
there's no ivs,
so it's,

2005
01:26:11,270 --> 01:26:13,380
it's ah ha ha.
You have to be disciplined.

2006
01:26:13,381 --> 01:26:15,470
We want to fight at the world class
level.

2007
01:26:15,590 --> 01:26:17,150
You got to be disciplined outside camp
now.

2008
01:26:17,180 --> 01:26:19,700
He just didn't look like a killer in
that fight.

2009
01:26:19,730 --> 01:26:22,040
He just didn't look like the same.
Johnny didn't look.

2010
01:26:22,041 --> 01:26:25,820
I've been joHnny hendricks at,
knocked out marvin camp men or martin

2011
01:26:25,821 --> 01:26:27,080
kampmann or the Johnny Hendricks.

2012
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:29,420
He knocked out fitch or the robbie
lawler fight.

2013
01:26:29,450 --> 01:26:31,430
Yeah,
I think he had fire in his eyes and

2014
01:26:31,431 --> 01:26:35,960
those fights and you got to also take
into consideration a lot of distractions

2015
01:26:35,961 --> 01:26:39,530
outside the octagon.
He stArted a fucking restaurant member,

2016
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:40,850
started a restaurant,
Texas.

2017
01:26:40,851 --> 01:26:43,910
he owned break open a steakhouse and it
went under with the quickness.

2018
01:26:43,990 --> 01:26:48,990
Not mad at that idea though.
Do the reviews were hard to shitty

2019
01:26:49,611 --> 01:26:51,550
service.
This terrible food.

2020
01:26:52,660 --> 01:26:56,810
Cooking steaks and shit.
I don't know what he was a bad idea,

2021
01:26:56,870 --> 01:26:59,540
but why would you do that in the middle
of your competitive career?

2022
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:01,430
I mean,
I don't know who fucking told him to do

2023
01:27:01,431 --> 01:27:01,691
that.
Well,

2024
01:27:01,691 --> 01:27:03,950
he probably just invested in it.
Whatever.

2025
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:06,050
It doesn't affect his training.
It affects.

2026
01:27:06,051 --> 01:27:08,750
you will remember he left that camp
though.

2027
01:27:09,020 --> 01:27:10,250
Yes.
He left with the.

2028
01:27:10,270 --> 01:27:13,610
In their agreement was we take a
percentage of this and we pay for

2029
01:27:13,611 --> 01:27:15,380
everything and things was like fuck this
man.

2030
01:27:15,380 --> 01:27:17,240
I'm out.
And then he hasn't been the same man.

2031
01:27:17,330 --> 01:27:21,890
Well they paid for everything too.
They gave hIm a salary and then they

2032
01:27:21,891 --> 01:27:23,380
had,
they had hired all these trainers.

2033
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:25,760
Will all these camps.
He's super camps.

2034
01:27:25,820 --> 01:27:28,550
They all hemorrhage cash,
you know,

2035
01:27:28,700 --> 01:27:32,570
like the black zillions are in a
situation right now because the owner

2036
01:27:32,571 --> 01:27:35,660
just declared bankruptcy.
Did you hear about that,

2037
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:36,530
Glenn Robinson?
Yeah.

2038
01:27:36,530 --> 01:27:38,730
make sure that's true.
It is.

2039
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:39,270
It's.
Yeah,

2040
01:27:39,270 --> 01:27:42,620
it's that it wasn't affecting the black
zillions at the time.

2041
01:27:44,390 --> 01:27:45,223
Excuse me,
sir.

2042
01:27:45,730 --> 01:27:48,350
No money.
Listen funds that.

2043
01:27:48,710 --> 01:27:51,680
The only way those things make money,
the only way those camps make money.

2044
01:27:51,790 --> 01:27:54,020
Oh,
the only way is if they become

2045
01:27:54,021 --> 01:27:58,700
successful for a long period of time.
Like jackson's were like jackson's done

2046
01:27:58,701 --> 01:28:00,290
it the right way.
They have world champions.

2047
01:28:00,291 --> 01:28:02,660
They have elite high level athletes
train there all the time.

2048
01:28:03,110 --> 01:28:06,770
They slowly develop a massive fuCking
clientele.

2049
01:28:06,771 --> 01:28:10,940
They have massive amounts of students so
people are paying dues and they can

2050
01:28:10,941 --> 01:28:13,340
expand its students though.
That's the key word.

2051
01:28:13,341 --> 01:28:16,370
You students pay the bill though.
Hilton and the flutters bring the

2052
01:28:16,371 --> 01:28:18,020
attention,
but most people don't do that.

2053
01:28:18,070 --> 01:28:19,130
Yeah,
like blackzilians.

2054
01:28:19,250 --> 01:28:23,550
I don't think that for any classes they
paid like overindulge a gillion dollars

2055
01:28:23,580 --> 01:28:26,780
to ladies and that didn't even work.
Worked out by himself in the corner.

2056
01:28:26,990 --> 01:28:29,630
Yeah.
I apparently didn't enjoy training with

2057
01:28:29,631 --> 01:28:30,464
everybody else.

2058
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:34,370
Yeah,
I mean that's not play well with others.

2059
01:28:34,430 --> 01:28:35,620
He,
you know,

2060
01:28:35,621 --> 01:28:37,480
he threw a lot of cash at people.
It's,

2061
01:28:38,820 --> 01:28:40,640
it's terrible.
Just a rich guy that doesn't know the

2062
01:28:40,641 --> 01:28:44,930
sport tool manufacturer with more than
10 million in debt filed chapter 11.

2063
01:28:44,931 --> 01:28:47,570
see that ain't good.
She said tool,

2064
01:28:47,790 --> 01:28:49,670
when you have more than 10 million in
debt,

2065
01:28:49,671 --> 01:28:52,910
that means jamie,
you're richer than him because he owes

2066
01:28:52,911 --> 01:28:54,620
10 million bucks.
You don't know $10 million.

2067
01:28:55,110 --> 01:28:56,810
So went.
So this guy's running around like he's

2068
01:28:56,811 --> 01:28:59,480
rich driving fucking ferrari's and shit.
Like,

2069
01:28:59,481 --> 01:29:00,081
no,
no,

2070
01:29:00,081 --> 01:29:01,530
you're not rich anymore.
You,

2071
01:29:01,650 --> 01:29:02,220
you fucked

2072
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:03,840
up.
You spend all your money on overeem.

2073
01:29:04,230 --> 01:29:04,981
And we met the.
Yeah,

2074
01:29:04,981 --> 01:29:06,660
that's right.
The adults met reality show.

2075
01:29:06,661 --> 01:29:09,570
The ultimate fighter man.
That was with the black zealand's and

2076
01:29:09,571 --> 01:29:10,910
american top team.
Yeah.

2077
01:29:10,980 --> 01:29:15,980
This was like the focal point when the
guy arguing a our season ever.

2078
01:29:16,700 --> 01:29:18,870
I don't want to see two rich guys argue
about as fighters.

2079
01:29:18,990 --> 01:29:23,100
Well dan lambert is a,
an actual guy who trains.

2080
01:29:23,101 --> 01:29:24,990
I mean I think he's got his black belt
now.

2081
01:29:25,010 --> 01:29:26,760
I'm super legit.
I mean,

2082
01:29:26,761 --> 01:29:31,170
he was a brown belt for a long time and
he's a real fan of the sport and if it

2083
01:29:31,171 --> 01:29:36,090
was anybody that deserves credit for not
just keeping that team alive,

2084
01:29:36,091 --> 01:29:38,520
american top team,
but dumping a ton of money into

2085
01:29:38,550 --> 01:29:43,550
investing a ton of money into the sport
and developing a legit world class

2086
01:29:44,131 --> 01:29:46,440
facility.
It's dan lambert that guide needs.

2087
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:48,570
He deserves all the props in the world.

2088
01:29:48,610 --> 01:29:51,430
He's legit as fuck off my tv though.
But a

2089
01:29:53,060 --> 01:29:55,590
ak is done the fucking thing.
Yes.

2090
01:29:55,591 --> 01:29:57,500
They've done it the right way.
They never went back.

2091
01:29:57,990 --> 01:30:00,720
They never went into debt.
They did it smart if students.

2092
01:30:00,750 --> 01:30:01,680
Yup.
Students,

2093
01:30:01,770 --> 01:30:03,450
you've got to have students.
Got to have students.

2094
01:30:03,690 --> 01:30:04,411
Well,
you know what it is,

2095
01:30:04,411 --> 01:30:06,030
man.
These guys like if you look at that guy

2096
01:30:06,031 --> 01:30:08,520
from the black sea lanes,
no offense,

2097
01:30:08,950 --> 01:30:11,430
but let's just be real.
That guy's a doughboy.

2098
01:30:11,790 --> 01:30:14,940
He's got a big fat face.
Probably never good at any sports.

2099
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:17,210
And uh,
you wanted to be in with the cool guys

2100
01:30:17,220 --> 01:30:18,270
to be associated with them.
Yeah.

2101
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:20,250
So he deCided he's going to pay for
everything.

2102
01:30:20,251 --> 01:30:23,220
Maybe he's a big fan of sport.
Invests a lot of money in it and good

2103
01:30:23,221 --> 01:30:24,090
for him.
Look,

2104
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:29,280
he maintained it for this long,
which is way longer than most people

2105
01:30:29,281 --> 01:30:30,114
would have.

2106
01:30:30,150 --> 01:30:33,690
if you really stop and think about it.
You just can't be a smart business

2107
01:30:33,691 --> 01:30:35,640
banking into the sport and dump all that
cash.

2108
01:30:35,670 --> 01:30:39,090
You'd have to be some rupert murdoch
type character that's got just fucking

2109
01:30:39,091 --> 01:30:41,400
kajillions.
You can't have 10 million debt with your

2110
01:30:41,401 --> 01:30:43,740
tool company.
Can't.

2111
01:30:43,741 --> 01:30:46,840
Sorry dude.
And then pay over him all this money or

2112
01:30:47,340 --> 01:30:50,460
I'll come and then it gets into.
I'm not working out the same time.

2113
01:30:50,461 --> 01:30:51,570
Everyone else says.
He's like,

2114
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:52,770
fuck,
I didn't even think about this.

2115
01:30:53,010 --> 01:30:54,810
Oh yeah bitch.
We're fighters.

2116
01:30:54,820 --> 01:30:57,070
We have the biggest egos ever.
So it might.

2117
01:30:57,080 --> 01:31:00,240
It doesn't work like that.
You just don't plug and play guys,

2118
01:31:00,241 --> 01:31:01,290
man,
you don't.

2119
01:31:01,340 --> 01:31:05,880
You Have to be able to figure out some
way to make a team and then it's also

2120
01:31:05,881 --> 01:31:08,580
not a team sport.
So what happens when,

2121
01:31:08,581 --> 01:31:10,620
you know,
like att is dealing with right now with

2122
01:31:10,621 --> 01:31:12,570
robby lauer about the fight,
tyron woodley?

2123
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,460
No.
You have to figure out a way to navigate

2124
01:31:14,461 --> 01:31:16,740
those waters.
This is the first time atts had to deal

2125
01:31:16,741 --> 01:31:18,540
with it.
It's a good problem to Have though.

2126
01:31:18,570 --> 01:31:21,150
It's a very good problem to have,
but the thing is you got to invest in

2127
01:31:21,151 --> 01:31:22,530
young guys too.
You know what I'm saying?

2128
01:31:22,531 --> 01:31:24,420
Like he can't just be about the
superstars.

2129
01:31:24,470 --> 01:31:26,640
Yeah.
Of young guys coming up and they're the

2130
01:31:26,641 --> 01:31:29,040
guys that you built up.
Then you have to have class.

2131
01:31:29,041 --> 01:31:31,440
It's just a fucking terrible business
plan.

2132
01:31:31,470 --> 01:31:31,921
let's.
Yeah,

2133
01:31:31,921 --> 01:31:34,920
you have your real moron,
but you got to be a guy like dan lambert

2134
01:31:34,921 --> 01:31:39,000
who is very wealthy but truly
legitimately loves the sport.

2135
01:31:39,270 --> 01:31:42,270
Dan loves the sport,
but if you pulled dan aside and talked

2136
01:31:42,271 --> 01:31:46,350
to him about the headaches,
he'll just go off fucking christ dance.

2137
01:31:46,351 --> 01:31:47,700
Super honest about it.
Yeah.

2138
01:31:47,701 --> 01:31:49,890
I wonder if you could go back in time if
you do it.

2139
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:51,720
Of course he would.
He just built a new facility.

2140
01:31:52,220 --> 01:31:54,720
Built flourish.
Huge gigantic plate.

2141
01:31:54,750 --> 01:31:56,520
How's he so rich?
He's a baller.

2142
01:31:57,230 --> 01:31:58,860
He's got.
He's just very successful in.

2143
01:31:59,530 --> 01:32:00,040
He's got a bunch

2144
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:02,560
of shitty tool company and no tool
company.

2145
01:32:02,590 --> 01:32:04,630
He's a legitimate,
you know,

2146
01:32:04,780 --> 01:32:09,040
super wealthy dude who's a legitimate
fan of mma.

2147
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:13,960
I've been friends with dan for shit
going on like 15 years.

2148
01:32:13,961 --> 01:32:16,090
I've known him.
He's always been like that.

2149
01:32:16,091 --> 01:32:17,770
I've talked to him once.
He was super nice to me.

2150
01:32:18,250 --> 01:32:20,500
We went to see the ifl.
He and I,

2151
01:32:20,501 --> 01:32:22,990
uh,
and eddie bravo went to see the ifl

2152
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:24,970
together school.
Yeah.

2153
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:28,510
Where was that?
I want to say it's in like fucking New

2154
01:32:28,510 --> 01:32:32,800
Jersey or something like that.
Att for a while was the biggest camp

2155
01:32:32,830 --> 01:32:36,110
ever remember?
They had like thiago alves that big

2156
01:32:36,111 --> 01:32:37,090
foot.
Who else?

2157
01:32:37,091 --> 01:32:38,870
They have that?
Hector lumbar.

2158
01:32:39,020 --> 01:32:42,190
They just had the who's who?
It was like the number one spot to be

2159
01:32:42,191 --> 01:32:44,020
at.
I remember for the longest time.

2160
01:32:44,050 --> 01:32:46,120
Yeah.
Kimbo went down there.

2161
01:32:46,350 --> 01:32:50,290
I'll be lawler king mo said Mark Hunt.
Yup.

2162
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:55,150
Well blackzilians extracted people from
att.

2163
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:59,680
They paid paid people to go over there
and there was like a big exodus where a

2164
01:32:59,681 --> 01:33:01,930
bunch of people just get their bills
paid and you know,

2165
01:33:01,980 --> 01:33:04,660
dude threw some money at him.
He wanted to build up a team.

2166
01:33:04,690 --> 01:33:07,150
I did half my camp for a nogueira down
there.

2167
01:33:07,300 --> 01:33:08,590
Yeah,
I wasn't with rashad.

2168
01:33:09,010 --> 01:33:11,770
Um,
I mean it was good sparring because it

2169
01:33:11,771 --> 01:33:15,820
was like rashad rumble.
Johnson just rumble.

2170
01:33:16,150 --> 01:33:17,170
Yeah.
Was that,

2171
01:33:17,330 --> 01:33:20,680
I mean nightmare.
We just think we only did one round,

2172
01:33:20,681 --> 01:33:22,330
but he wasn't in camp so he's kind of
like,

2173
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:24,160
whatever.
He's a fucking nightmare.

2174
01:33:24,161 --> 01:33:25,240
He's huge.
He's like,

2175
01:33:25,241 --> 01:33:26,350
you're bigger than me.
I'm fighting that.

2176
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:30,970
Everyone's weird.
Super nice guy and he can wrestle his

2177
01:33:30,971 --> 01:33:33,450
ass off this people don't know,
just fucking rest.

2178
01:33:33,451 --> 01:33:35,680
Dot athlete of the camp was good there,
but it was.

2179
01:33:36,010 --> 01:33:37,600
Rashad was getting ready for a fight
too.

2180
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:39,310
I forget who's getting ready for.
Oh john.

2181
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:40,840
I may have been john,
but

2182
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:44,650
you know,
it was about rashawn rashad's the

2183
01:33:44,651 --> 01:33:46,750
captain of that team.
It's just weird,

2184
01:33:46,751 --> 01:33:47,271
man.
You know,

2185
01:33:47,271 --> 01:33:50,290
if,
I don't know they've invested in you.

2186
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:53,410
It was a good switch up for me because
my managers down there and he had a huge

2187
01:33:53,411 --> 01:33:56,650
house.
I needed a change and different sparring

2188
01:33:56,651 --> 01:33:58,450
partners.
So I flew down there for two weeks and

2189
01:33:58,451 --> 01:34:02,320
then fly back and forth as you can tell,
probably wasn't the smartest.

2190
01:34:02,321 --> 01:34:06,100
The fight didn't go.
Carets seemed like a good facility down

2191
01:34:06,101 --> 01:34:06,970
there.
It was.

2192
01:34:06,971 --> 01:34:07,870
All right.
Just.

2193
01:34:07,871 --> 01:34:08,740
All right.
Just all right.

2194
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:09,491
Yeah,
nothing,

2195
01:34:09,491 --> 01:34:10,720
nothing crazy.
Just all right.

2196
01:34:10,721 --> 01:34:12,340
Compared to other gyms.
Yeah.

2197
01:34:13,750 --> 01:34:16,120
Yeah.
What is the best facility right now?

2198
01:34:16,121 --> 01:34:17,860
Going?
Is it att tristar?

2199
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:19,600
Tristar.
How so?

2200
01:34:20,740 --> 01:34:22,750
I think tristar,
because for ross,

2201
01:34:22,820 --> 01:34:23,441
he,
he,

2202
01:34:23,441 --> 01:34:24,310
you know,
he's not

2203
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:27,490
like,
he doesn't want fame.

2204
01:34:27,970 --> 01:34:29,860
He's,
he was a fighter himself.

2205
01:34:29,861 --> 01:34:32,200
He's ridiculous.
At kickboxing,

2206
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:35,480
jujitsu.
He teaches the jujitsu in a geeky.

2207
01:34:35,740 --> 01:34:37,770
So there's their students,
so he's not riding,

2208
01:34:37,780 --> 01:34:40,630
dying off the paycheck of rory or gsp,
stuff like that.

2209
01:34:41,380 --> 01:34:43,420
There's professional boxers that work
out there.

2210
01:34:43,421 --> 01:34:45,430
They have a boxing ring,
they have an octagon,

2211
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:47,333
don't.
It's just a,

2212
01:34:47,410 --> 01:34:50,650
it's like a,
it's a motivating environment as far as

2213
01:34:51,370 --> 01:34:53,230
like other gyms.
It's intimidating.

2214
01:34:53,231 --> 01:34:54,340
You know what I'm saying?
Does that make sense?

2215
01:34:54,370 --> 01:34:54,940
Yes,
it does.

2216
01:34:54,940 --> 01:34:57,980
Like I remember going to jackson jackson
world class,

2217
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:02,030
best of the best,
but it was like nonstop sparring and I

2218
01:35:02,031 --> 01:35:02,900
was like,
fuck man.

2219
01:35:02,930 --> 01:35:04,850
My,
my coaches from denver weren't there

2220
01:35:04,851 --> 01:35:07,190
when I'd go there,
so it was like I just always,

2221
01:35:07,191 --> 01:35:10,790
I'm so intimidated there all the time
because it was just straight up banging.

2222
01:35:12,110 --> 01:35:13,550
Yeah,
that could be a problem too,

2223
01:35:13,551 --> 01:35:17,120
right at the balance between sparring
and technical work.

2224
01:35:17,510 --> 01:35:20,650
Like a keith jardine and I were just
together.

2225
01:35:20,660 --> 01:35:25,010
Haven't seen keith for ever chiesa close
friend man and I look at keith because

2226
01:35:25,011 --> 01:35:27,980
keith and he's doing the act and now
he's doing well and he was talking about

2227
01:35:27,981 --> 01:35:30,530
the podcast game,
all this stuff and we're laughing.

2228
01:35:30,710 --> 01:35:34,070
I go pro.
Remember how we used to fucking spar?

2229
01:35:34,370 --> 01:35:38,300
Remember you go in,
you would do a round with me.

2230
01:35:38,301 --> 01:35:40,430
You'd stay in.
Shame would climb in.

2231
01:35:40,550 --> 01:35:42,860
You do two rounds with him and then I
would jump in.

2232
01:35:42,860 --> 01:35:44,540
He goes,
what the fuck were we thinking?

2233
01:35:45,710 --> 01:35:46,880
Dude,
you guys are older than me.

2234
01:35:46,881 --> 01:35:48,500
I thought you guys knew what was up.
He goes,

2235
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:50,810
insane,
man in st stephen goes,

2236
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:54,050
I wish I would've stopped sooner.
Here's those last couple.

2237
01:35:54,051 --> 01:35:56,980
I wish someone had told me because we
were talking about our lives.

2238
01:35:57,020 --> 01:35:58,610
I wish someone would've told me.
He goes,

2239
01:35:58,611 --> 01:36:00,770
I wish I would have stopped sooner.
Now here's the last one.

2240
01:36:00,771 --> 01:36:04,130
We're wasting my time because we were
talking about mutual friend.

2241
01:36:04,131 --> 01:36:05,900
We have a very close friend.
I'm like,

2242
01:36:05,901 --> 01:36:07,360
fuck,
I wish she would stop man.

2243
01:36:07,790 --> 01:36:09,470
He's like,
you just talked to another dates.

2244
01:36:09,560 --> 01:36:12,140
I dunno man.
They still want to do it.

2245
01:36:13,490 --> 01:36:16,100
Yeah.
It's hard to get a guy to walk away from

2246
01:36:16,101 --> 01:36:20,480
it because everything else is so muted
in dl and the experience of competing is

2247
01:36:20,590 --> 01:36:24,260
such a massive,
massive rush of excitement and the

2248
01:36:24,261 --> 01:36:27,830
bleakness of the possibilities and the
opportunities outside of the cage.

2249
01:36:28,220 --> 01:36:28,730
Yeah.
And if,

2250
01:36:28,730 --> 01:36:29,570
if,
but if that,

2251
01:36:29,610 --> 01:36:31,580
the issue is,
if that's your identity,

2252
01:36:31,581 --> 01:36:33,500
like most any athlete,
not just fighters,

2253
01:36:33,530 --> 01:36:35,270
football players,
boxers,

2254
01:36:35,271 --> 01:36:36,950
basketball players,
if that's your identity,

2255
01:36:36,951 --> 01:36:38,810
like you're known as mr.
Fighter and mr.

2256
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:41,550
Basketball.
It's a depressing man.

2257
01:36:42,470 --> 01:36:44,030
Super depressing.
All right,

2258
01:36:44,031 --> 01:36:45,890
let's look at that card.
What else we got on that card?

2259
01:36:46,170 --> 01:36:47,230
Um,
so what do you,

2260
01:36:47,231 --> 01:36:50,190
what do you like in the frankie and
aldo?

2261
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:53,210
That's the toughest fight for me to pick
it.

2262
01:36:53,250 --> 01:36:57,290
Really.
If you take away the last fight with

2263
01:36:57,291 --> 01:37:02,291
frankie or with a aldo and conor,
then it becomes a tough fight for

2264
01:37:02,571 --> 01:37:05,330
frankie to when frank has got to be at
his best.

2265
01:37:05,331 --> 01:37:06,320
Right?
He's an underdog,

2266
01:37:07,130 --> 01:37:12,050
but frankie,
you look at his victories and you gotta

2267
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:14,110
think he looks better than ever like
frankie's,

2268
01:37:14,140 --> 01:37:18,950
that he's in his prime right now.
Will unquestionably in his prime the cub

2269
01:37:18,951 --> 01:37:21,050
swanson fight chose that the.

2270
01:37:21,050 --> 01:37:24,470
I mean,
your wife's favorite fight was not very

2271
01:37:24,471 --> 01:37:29,471
impressive that uriah faber fight was a
fight where he just sort of one,

2272
01:37:30,710 --> 01:37:32,230
but it was not that big of a deal.
Right?

2273
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:33,860
It's fucking tough to finish,
man.

2274
01:37:34,010 --> 01:37:36,860
He is tough to finish.
But dominick cruz beat the shit out of

2275
01:37:36,861 --> 01:37:40,250
him and dominick cruz did it in a much
more convincing way.

2276
01:37:40,850 --> 01:37:44,900
You know frankie beat Him.
The Chad mendez fight with spectacular

2277
01:37:44,901 --> 01:37:46,520
first round knockout.
That was amazing.

2278
01:37:46,610 --> 01:37:47,540
And you can't.
Mma.

2279
01:37:47,541 --> 01:37:48,980
Math never works.
We all know this,

2280
01:37:48,981 --> 01:37:52,580
but when you see what frankie did to
Chad mendez,

2281
01:37:52,581 --> 01:37:55,980
they look at more that aldo in Chad
mendez had.

2282
01:37:56,430 --> 01:37:58,040
It's just so impressive,
right?

2283
01:37:58,050 --> 01:38:01,740
But then you look at what aldo did to
uriah faber,

2284
01:38:01,770 --> 01:38:06,450
beat the fucking brakes off him.
He beat the fucking life out of them,

2285
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:08,680
beat the life out of them.
Then you look at frankie did room.

2286
01:38:08,681 --> 01:38:10,830
It's not as impressive and maybe math
doesn't work,

2287
01:38:10,850 --> 01:38:12,830
doesn't work.
and then you got to remember now that

2288
01:38:12,900 --> 01:38:16,410
there's new testing involved.
I'm not saying on things,

2289
01:38:16,411 --> 01:38:18,110
but I'm saying we only have one
brazilian champ before.

2290
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:19,800
Had many more.
Even though you know,

2291
01:38:19,801 --> 01:38:21,680
forget about just talking about
resilience.

2292
01:38:21,690 --> 01:38:24,810
I go all fighters across the board.
When you see first of all,

2293
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:28,490
although is now,
what is he 32 holds.

2294
01:38:28,520 --> 01:38:32,100
Although if you had to guess 31,
31.

2295
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:35,070
Uh,
I would say so he's in the neighborhood,

2296
01:38:35,071 --> 01:38:36,060
right?
What do we got here?

2297
01:38:36,690 --> 01:38:37,650
Twenty nine.
Okay.

2298
01:38:38,110 --> 01:38:41,010
It's in the neighborhood and fight for.
I've been fighting for a long time.

2299
01:38:41,100 --> 01:38:42,870
Had some incredible,
incredible fights.

2300
01:38:43,320 --> 01:38:46,740
But you,
you've definitely seen a change in his

2301
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:48,930
physique.
and then you could say,

2302
01:38:48,931 --> 01:38:52,350
well you go back to like the first Chad
mendez fight in particular,

2303
01:38:52,351 --> 01:38:54,810
just tracked.
BuT you got to think,

2304
01:38:54,811 --> 01:38:58,050
okay,
well he also had a hard time making 1:45

2305
01:38:58,051 --> 01:39:02,130
back then.
So it could be that he decided to lean

2306
01:39:02,131 --> 01:39:04,920
out because it's easier on it's cardio,
you know,

2307
01:39:04,921 --> 01:39:06,950
there's a lot going on there.
But didn't chat.

2308
01:39:06,980 --> 01:39:08,670
Chat tested positive too recently,
right?

2309
01:39:08,671 --> 01:39:10,950
Yes he did.
Yes he did.

2310
01:39:11,310 --> 01:39:14,820
Yeah.
He tested positive for some peptides.

2311
01:39:14,821 --> 01:39:19,020
I think growth hormone,
peptides to move.

2312
01:39:19,021 --> 01:39:24,021
Saucy isn't on the fucking undercard
against leonardo santos and santos.

2313
01:39:24,241 --> 01:39:26,950
Excuse me.
And no one's even fucking Talking.

2314
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:29,880
Jim miller gummies kicks the flight path
off.

2315
01:39:29,940 --> 01:39:32,550
These us gummies.
Like I'm the first fight of the night.

2316
01:39:32,551 --> 01:39:34,650
What the fuck?
It's good for him.

2317
01:39:35,260 --> 01:39:38,640
He go.
Me is the way he performs lately has

2318
01:39:38,641 --> 01:39:43,641
been a shell of himself.
I mean it's just winging giant bombs and

2319
01:39:44,281 --> 01:39:49,281
hands down and plotting and you know,
jim miller is a guy who's just had wars,

2320
01:39:51,570 --> 01:39:53,770
so many wars.
So it's joe lozan man.

2321
01:39:54,160 --> 01:39:56,170
Like I'll watch joe lowe's on flights
and then like.

2322
01:39:56,220 --> 01:39:58,080
And I love the dude.
He's one of my favorites.

2323
01:39:58,260 --> 01:40:01,140
Mr. Bonus
stuff,

2324
01:40:01,260 --> 01:40:02,460
man.
It is tough.

2325
01:40:02,610 --> 01:40:05,160
It's like where you know,
what happens there.

2326
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:09,750
And I'll tell you what,
cat zingano and juliana opinion is very

2327
01:40:09,751 --> 01:40:11,550
interesting for the bantamweight
division,

2328
01:40:11,820 --> 01:40:14,240
for the women's bantamweight division
because catching up.

2329
01:40:14,300 --> 01:40:16,350
First of all right there,
she jacked.

2330
01:40:16,890 --> 01:40:19,160
She's even leaner now is shame.
Yeah.

2331
01:40:19,220 --> 01:40:21,090
You'll see new pictures of her.
Good for her.

2332
01:40:21,420 --> 01:40:24,630
Well is a tough fight for her man.
Real tough fight.

2333
01:40:24,680 --> 01:40:28,210
Julianna pena is a beast.
And their friends to write a.

2334
01:40:28,290 --> 01:40:29,730
They're not friends.
Uh,

2335
01:40:30,290 --> 01:40:32,580
Kenya and tate taylor.
A friend.

2336
01:40:32,590 --> 01:40:33,440
Really close.
Yeah.

2337
01:40:33,480 --> 01:40:34,830
Yeah.
Which is interesting because they might

2338
01:40:34,831 --> 01:40:35,910
have to fight pen.
Yes.

2339
01:40:35,911 --> 01:40:37,350
It sign me up.
Yeah.

2340
01:40:37,351 --> 01:40:39,960
I mean she's got to say that girls don't
care man.

2341
01:40:40,190 --> 01:40:42,780
She's just difference for the title.
Dudes are like,

2342
01:40:42,781 --> 01:40:45,000
I don't know.
Girls like I will fuck her up.

2343
01:40:45,490 --> 01:40:49,110
God damn girl relapses a.
This is an interesting fight.

2344
01:40:49,290 --> 01:40:52,840
Striking wise cat has a big advantage of
grappling.

2345
01:40:52,860 --> 01:40:54,140
I'd cat you

2346
01:40:54,140 --> 01:40:57,310
think so cat as well in grappling.
Julianna pena can grapple,

2347
01:40:57,311 --> 01:40:59,290
man.
She's strong as fuck.

2348
01:40:59,291 --> 01:41:01,630
Dude.
Cat is so fucking strong.

2349
01:41:01,631 --> 01:41:04,030
She,
she threw calendar around like a fucking

2350
01:41:04,031 --> 01:41:04,864
rag doll.
I was,

2351
01:41:04,870 --> 01:41:06,600
I got on video.
Do you just say cowen?

2352
01:41:06,620 --> 01:41:07,990
Yeah.
A grown man though.

2353
01:41:08,470 --> 01:41:12,400
Or is he really?
Is he really by whose?

2354
01:41:12,830 --> 01:41:15,280
Whose definition?
Other than 35 pound man.

2355
01:41:15,370 --> 01:41:18,200
Did he try to grapple with her?
No.

2356
01:41:18,350 --> 01:41:19,930
Oh yeah.
Poor baby.

2357
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:21,880
Awesome.
Awesome.

2358
01:41:22,360 --> 01:41:24,310
Uh,
he of all the p,

2359
01:41:24,340 --> 01:41:26,530
he's got body dysmorphia the opposite
way.

2360
01:41:26,980 --> 01:41:28,780
Most people think they're smaller than
they are.

2361
01:41:29,120 --> 01:41:32,440
Like I was like,
why would you grapple cat?

2362
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:34,420
Well,
not only that,

2363
01:41:34,450 --> 01:41:38,400
he doesn't train at all ever.
I mean he,

2364
01:41:38,401 --> 01:41:40,450
he like,
he like hit the mitts.

2365
01:41:40,510 --> 01:41:43,450
I guess nine.
He does something that's supposedly.

2366
01:41:43,700 --> 01:41:47,290
It's kind of like sparring.
Don't get me started.

2367
01:41:48,380 --> 01:41:50,440
It'S a good fight though.
This is a good fact.

2368
01:41:50,710 --> 01:41:52,900
What's interesting is they started
standing up,

2369
01:41:53,210 --> 01:41:58,060
can't counted her because cat Wrestled
in high school and then she won worlds

2370
01:41:58,061 --> 01:41:59,350
as a,
I think a white belt.

2371
01:41:59,750 --> 01:42:00,660
you like,
kat,

2372
01:42:00,670 --> 01:42:03,370
can you.
She gets cramped and she's,

2373
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:05,320
you know,
she's a thick girl.

2374
01:42:05,480 --> 01:42:07,010
Girl,
strong man.

2375
01:42:07,420 --> 01:42:09,100
When she tried some loren landow and
she's a,

2376
01:42:09,250 --> 01:42:12,040
the number she puts up,
she's a beast.

2377
01:42:12,730 --> 01:42:14,590
She's no joke.
Strong girl.

2378
01:42:14,620 --> 01:42:16,780
Very tough in that fucking meesha take
kao,

2379
01:42:17,030 --> 01:42:20,500
which you carried her with.
That elbow wound killed both those girls

2380
01:42:20,501 --> 01:42:23,860
go fucking chairmanship,
she's nasty,

2381
01:42:24,490 --> 01:42:28,570
goodness,
suicide and all that stuff.

2382
01:42:28,571 --> 01:42:33,520
So she took a shitload of time off and
then she lost him literally 13 seconds

2383
01:42:33,521 --> 01:42:34,570
to rhonda,
but she,

2384
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:36,280
she was sayIng how,
and it's true,

2385
01:42:36,310 --> 01:42:39,100
like her head coach leaster bolin who
she left to go to alliance,

2386
01:42:39,190 --> 01:42:41,980
she was saying he was like the issue
with her.

2387
01:42:41,980 --> 01:42:43,630
She never wants to game plan and watch
tape.

2388
01:42:43,631 --> 01:42:45,230
She Just wants to fight and scrap.
Right.

2389
01:42:45,370 --> 01:42:47,620
Which at a certain level you just can't.
You just can't.

2390
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:48,850
You can't.
It's a,

2391
01:42:48,851 --> 01:42:50,320
it's a,
it's a sport.

2392
01:42:50,321 --> 01:42:53,740
You do have to game plan tendencies and
she never wanted to.

2393
01:42:53,741 --> 01:42:55,420
She hated it.
It made her,

2394
01:42:55,421 --> 01:42:57,120
it stressed her out.
So the,

2395
01:42:57,140 --> 01:43:00,820
the coaches would do it but tell her.
But like in that ronda fight,

2396
01:43:01,080 --> 01:43:04,210
hey man,
you can't brunch straight at her and

2397
01:43:04,211 --> 01:43:06,460
just get an bar in 13 seconds.
Yeah.

2398
01:43:06,550 --> 01:43:09,370
Like you just can't.
And so now she's at alliance and she's

2399
01:43:09,371 --> 01:43:10,900
like this,
the first vital I'm going to have a game

2400
01:43:10,901 --> 01:43:12,610
plan for.
So it could be good.

2401
01:43:13,420 --> 01:43:14,680
Could be.
It's interesting.

2402
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:16,060
Yeah.
It could be for some,

2403
01:43:16,090 --> 01:43:18,190
it's not for everyone,
you know what I'm saying?

2404
01:43:18,191 --> 01:43:22,540
Like they think too much.
Julianna pena is going to be at a

2405
01:43:22,541 --> 01:43:24,650
disadvantage striking,
but I don't know if she's going to be at

2406
01:43:24,651 --> 01:43:26,860
a disadvantage.
Grappling opinions.

2407
01:43:27,310 --> 01:43:29,460
Fucking beast on the ground.
[inaudible].

2408
01:43:29,830 --> 01:43:31,210
Interesting.
Very interesting.

2409
01:43:31,700 --> 01:43:35,170
Very good.
I think cat has an advantage as far as

2410
01:43:35,171 --> 01:43:38,770
just sIze and strength that she's
fucking strong women for a girl.

2411
01:43:39,320 --> 01:43:43,240
This is a fucking crazy card.
LiKe look at this.

2412
01:43:43,241 --> 01:43:46,840
Now we just keep going.
It's almost like christmas at a rich

2413
01:43:46,841 --> 01:43:49,800
kid's house straight.
Just keep opening 10 minutes.

2414
01:43:51,150 --> 01:43:52,100
Rich rich

2415
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:55,290
aunt's house and just fucking open
prevalence these fucking president.

2416
01:43:55,291 --> 01:43:57,800
Fuck man.
I mean by the end of the night I'm going

2417
01:43:57,801 --> 01:43:59,980
to be exhausted dude.
Yeah,

2418
01:44:00,080 --> 01:44:02,300
I'm going on vacation.
Usually I wouldn't give a fuck.

2419
01:44:02,301 --> 01:44:05,150
But um,
I will find somewhere to watch ufc 200.

2420
01:44:05,250 --> 01:44:05,961
Yeah.
Well you know,

2421
01:44:05,961 --> 01:44:08,540
if you have fight pass,
you could watch paper view from your

2422
01:44:08,541 --> 01:44:09,770
laptop.
Do you know that?

2423
01:44:10,310 --> 01:44:11,150
I didn't know that.
Yeah.

2424
01:44:11,151 --> 01:44:13,910
You can get paper view from fight pass.
I'm going to Hawaii though.

2425
01:44:13,911 --> 01:44:16,250
There's a fight town.
It is a fight town,

2426
01:44:16,930 --> 01:44:20,930
um,
but I watched a fight pass on my tv the

2427
01:44:20,931 --> 01:44:24,140
other day or watched a paper view
because uh,

2428
01:44:24,141 --> 01:44:27,880
I forgot to order a paper view once and
so I bought it off a fight pass and I

2429
01:44:27,881 --> 01:44:29,000
was like,
oh yeah,

2430
01:44:29,001 --> 01:44:31,400
you can just get it off.
Bypass this pretty dope.

2431
01:44:32,300 --> 01:44:34,790
That's fucking awesome man.
I don't fuck with fight pass.

2432
01:44:34,850 --> 01:44:37,150
Well,
apple tv is the shit.

2433
01:44:37,190 --> 01:44:41,420
I love apple tv and a ufc fight pass as
an app.

2434
01:44:41,450 --> 01:44:44,990
You can download it from anyone.
Watch ufc fight pass right on apple tv.

2435
01:44:44,991 --> 01:44:46,370
It's pretty dope.
Oh my god.

2436
01:44:46,371 --> 01:44:50,360
You have every fight ever.
And I use my phone as my remote control.

2437
01:44:51,090 --> 01:44:53,630
They're selling me on this show.
It's like an ad and

2438
01:44:55,700 --> 01:44:56,451
I don't know.
Yeah,

2439
01:44:56,451 --> 01:44:58,940
I don't know.
I'll find someone out there to watch you

2440
01:44:58,941 --> 01:44:59,920
gotta watch.
Yeah.

2441
01:45:00,100 --> 01:45:02,790
I can't go to the bar man.
It's too intense for so.

2442
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:05,850
Highest stakes on the card.
Like dilla shot.

2443
01:45:05,870 --> 01:45:09,020
Just coming off one fight.
One fight ago.

2444
01:45:09,050 --> 01:45:11,750
He was a world Champion.
loses a super close decision.

2445
01:45:11,751 --> 01:45:14,000
Had dominick cruz super close.
You lose this one though.

2446
01:45:14,001 --> 01:45:15,080
See ya.
I know,

2447
01:45:15,081 --> 01:45:17,690
but like think about that loses a close
decision.

2448
01:45:17,691 --> 01:45:19,880
No one's talking about a rematch,
right?

2449
01:45:19,910 --> 01:45:21,380
No one's clamoring for a rematch.

2450
01:45:21,530 --> 01:45:25,910
I mean this guy goes out there.
Merck's hanan barao fights Joe Soto on

2451
01:45:25,911 --> 01:45:27,950
one day's notice.
Beat him down,

2452
01:45:27,951 --> 01:45:31,870
beat him in the face,
then goes in and my works and,

2453
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,040
and borrow.
The second time he came out just

2454
01:45:34,130 --> 01:45:35,350
destroys him.
No,

2455
01:45:35,351 --> 01:45:35,630
no,
no,

2456
01:45:35,630 --> 01:45:38,900
no.
Loses a close close decision to dominick

2457
01:45:38,901 --> 01:45:39,561
cruz.
And everybody's like,

2458
01:45:39,561 --> 01:45:40,850
yeah,
a hold.

2459
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:42,690
not really interested in anymore the
sports.

2460
01:45:44,180 --> 01:45:45,920
Fuck you.
But for tj,

2461
01:45:45,921 --> 01:45:49,940
that's fucking crazy.
I mean the kid was not only did I like

2462
01:45:49,941 --> 01:45:52,280
and I said this and I meant it
wholeheartedly.

2463
01:45:52,610 --> 01:45:54,620
I said,
not only did He submit his position as a

2464
01:45:54,621 --> 01:45:56,450
champion when he beat hanan barao the
second time,

2465
01:45:56,630 --> 01:45:59,570
but I said he made a very good argument
for being one of the best pound for

2466
01:45:59,571 --> 01:46:02,450
pound fighters in the world.
I think after that hennen browne fight,

2467
01:46:02,451 --> 01:46:07,451
I was thinking he's like top 10,
maybe even like top five or six pound

2468
01:46:07,641 --> 01:46:09,540
fighters in the world is tough,
but he's taught 10.

2469
01:46:09,540 --> 01:46:11,030
It's tough.
It's tough now.

2470
01:46:11,031 --> 01:46:12,790
It's tough because you lost the decision
to cruise.

2471
01:46:12,860 --> 01:46:14,810
See if he beats cruz,
then you go.

2472
01:46:14,811 --> 01:46:16,730
Well,
the kids got a real argument there.

2473
01:46:16,810 --> 01:46:19,580
He's top five and he could have beaten
him.

2474
01:46:19,581 --> 01:46:20,414
Man.
Look,

2475
01:46:20,510 --> 01:46:25,310
all tj dillashaw needed was a few more
well placed leg kicks in tHat fight.

2476
01:46:25,700 --> 01:46:29,300
If he had gone in concentrated Heavily
on that right leg kick,

2477
01:46:29,301 --> 01:46:31,610
dominick cruz out a fucked up foot
memory.

2478
01:46:31,640 --> 01:46:34,820
That plantar fasciitis,
which is brutal.

2479
01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:38,600
And uh,
I mean he could have easily,

2480
01:46:38,700 --> 01:46:41,810
could have easily went that way.
He also started planting his feet,

2481
01:46:41,900 --> 01:46:43,670
digging his toes in.
Yeah,

2482
01:46:43,671 --> 01:46:45,980
he was headhunting.
He was trying to dominic fuck with his

2483
01:46:45,981 --> 01:46:47,690
head man.
Dominic got in there.

2484
01:46:48,050 --> 01:46:50,460
I want to see that fight.
I don't see tj and dominant.

2485
01:46:50,490 --> 01:46:52,620
Fuck yes,
that's what I want to see.

2486
01:46:52,680 --> 01:46:54,150
But yeah,
I don't know what they're going to do.

2487
01:46:54,180 --> 01:46:56,760
Who's dominant going to find next to.
Does he have a fight scheduled?

2488
01:46:56,940 --> 01:47:00,720
No,
but they need to fucking to tj.

2489
01:47:00,990 --> 01:47:02,820
Tj wants this thing.
You go tj,

2490
01:47:02,850 --> 01:47:07,850
uriah.
Then they need to do dj for cruz or john

2491
01:47:08,910 --> 01:47:13,910
motherfucking dotson at 1:35.
John dodson at 1:35 is terrifying.

2492
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:18,690
He also beat tj on ultimate fighter k
odom.

2493
01:47:19,140 --> 01:47:24,140
He killed him and he is fast as fuck and
lights people on fire.

2494
01:47:25,550 --> 01:47:27,750
Think tj.
When's this one that gets a title shot?

2495
01:47:27,780 --> 01:47:29,550
He might not win this one.
Let me know.

2496
01:47:29,610 --> 01:47:31,940
I'm just saying if he does,
he lost this guy.

2497
01:47:31,980 --> 01:47:34,190
He could or he might have to fight
dodson.

2498
01:47:34,670 --> 01:47:36,690
If he loses fighting dot.
What if he wins?

2499
01:47:36,691 --> 01:47:39,930
He might fight dots.
I don't think you do that because if you

2500
01:47:39,931 --> 01:47:42,180
hate ratings,
you got to go.

2501
01:47:42,330 --> 01:47:44,730
Uriah faber or dominick cruz.
Next.

2502
01:47:45,070 --> 01:47:46,320
Tj,
tj.

2503
01:47:46,321 --> 01:47:48,030
Uriah faber is where the money's at.

2504
01:47:48,330 --> 01:47:49,990
That's the play and What's left for
here.

2505
01:47:50,010 --> 01:47:52,860
I met a man.
That wouldn't be so fun.

2506
01:47:53,070 --> 01:47:55,560
It was so cloSe though.
That makes me sad anymore.

2507
01:47:56,430 --> 01:47:58,170
Yeah,
that makes me sad.

2508
01:47:58,200 --> 01:47:59,090
it really does.
Yeah.

2509
01:47:59,091 --> 01:48:03,090
That's a bummer because when two guys
are bros like that bros before hoes,

2510
01:48:03,091 --> 01:48:05,190
what happened to that?
Nobody says that anymore.

2511
01:48:05,300 --> 01:48:06,960
No,
that's old school now.

2512
01:48:08,940 --> 01:48:13,770
TJ and uriah were so tight and soak in.
Tj still tight with Chad.

2513
01:48:13,950 --> 01:48:16,140
Chad and him was still buddies and joe
as well.

2514
01:48:16,170 --> 01:48:17,920
They're still buddies,
but you right?

2515
01:48:17,930 --> 01:48:21,030
Like you hold a grudge.
I think they both do.

2516
01:48:21,031 --> 01:48:24,240
That's why the fight would make sense.
We'd be crunk for it too.

2517
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:26,700
Well,
I wonder like how much your rise got

2518
01:48:26,701 --> 01:48:28,830
left in the tank.
I didn't like the way dominic was

2519
01:48:28,831 --> 01:48:30,040
hurting him in that fight.
I was like,

2520
01:48:30,060 --> 01:48:32,040
rule dot makes a fucking months.

2521
01:48:32,070 --> 01:48:34,350
Here's a monster.
But he's never been known to be a

2522
01:48:34,351 --> 01:48:36,280
knockout artists other than the
[inaudible] fight.

2523
01:48:36,380 --> 01:48:38,620
He murdered.
Mr. Got smashed.

2524
01:48:38,630 --> 01:48:40,650
That dude's fucking.
But he had.

2525
01:48:40,770 --> 01:48:45,770
He had you're rioting and trouble in
real trouble and he put your riot in a

2526
01:48:46,081 --> 01:48:49,290
defensive shell multiple times.
But let me tell you something.

2527
01:48:49,320 --> 01:48:52,890
This is an unheralded guide.
How fIle sun out number three in the

2528
01:48:52,891 --> 01:48:53,724
world.
Okay.

2529
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:56,460
And as far as contenders,
tj is the number one contender,

2530
01:48:56,850 --> 01:48:59,550
but half hour is.
No one's talkinG about him,

2531
01:48:59,551 --> 01:49:01,560
man.
He's fucking dangerous.

2532
01:49:01,650 --> 01:49:04,620
So this is a really tough fight for tj
because you got a guy who's already

2533
01:49:04,621 --> 01:49:07,560
beaten by decision is questionable as it
is and it's close.

2534
01:49:07,720 --> 01:49:12,720
It's close a decision that is as it is.
He's a fucking tough out for anybody,

2535
01:49:13,351 --> 01:49:16,310
man.
It's no joke and it's not doing tj any

2536
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:18,060
favors.
No like sense out.

2537
01:49:18,180 --> 01:49:20,140
He's number three in the world.
No one knows who he is.

2538
01:49:20,170 --> 01:49:22,620
He's a fucking nightmare and he's beat
him before.

2539
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:25,410
Like it's not doing tj any favors and
it's,

2540
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:28,260
you know,
it's one of those fights where no one's

2541
01:49:28,261 --> 01:49:29,250
talking about It,
man.

2542
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:31,740
I mean it's how came you look at this
fucking card?

2543
01:49:31,741 --> 01:49:33,290
It's,
it's,

2544
01:49:33,380 --> 01:49:37,620
it's gonna be a tough card to stand out.
Forget about the bonuses.

2545
01:49:37,621 --> 01:49:39,480
Who's getting a bonus in this fucking
car?

2546
01:49:39,750 --> 01:49:41,350
Those bonuses,
this,

2547
01:49:41,351 --> 01:49:44,610
there's something about those bonuses
that bugged me on ufc 200.

2548
01:49:44,611 --> 01:49:46,290
It's tough.
They throw a bonus,

2549
01:49:47,410 --> 01:49:48,160
but it's just something

2550
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:51,400
about it that bugs me.
It's like that.

2551
01:49:51,410 --> 01:49:54,690
You're,
you're fighting to hope that day decided

2552
01:49:54,691 --> 01:49:57,850
that you get extra money and let me tell
you something.

2553
01:49:57,870 --> 01:49:59,500
What do you think?
You're getting it and then they

2554
01:49:59,501 --> 01:50:03,530
announced you're not.
I felt like crying when I beat michio.

2555
01:50:03,550 --> 01:50:07,780
Now's the whole lot.
I was the first heavyweight ever in the

2556
01:50:07,781 --> 01:50:12,190
ufc heavyweight to win by anaconda
choked the first doc.

2557
01:50:12,470 --> 01:50:15,970
They didn't and I was like,
I'm just darson mer anaconda.

2558
01:50:16,010 --> 01:50:16,491
Oh,
dark,

2559
01:50:16,491 --> 01:50:17,650
sorry doris.
I was like,

2560
01:50:17,651 --> 01:50:18,740
damn,
I'm getting that bonus.

2561
01:50:18,741 --> 01:50:20,980
So I was thinking about how to spend the
money and you put them to sleep,

2562
01:50:21,130 --> 01:50:21,963
sleep,
sleep,

2563
01:50:22,060 --> 01:50:23,500
sleep,
sleep in the first round.

2564
01:50:23,501 --> 01:50:24,041
And we were like,
oh,

2565
01:50:24,041 --> 01:50:24,761
you're for sure.
Again,

2566
01:50:24,761 --> 01:50:28,360
it some dude on the undercard one by
guillotine and they gave it to him.

2567
01:50:29,080 --> 01:50:30,310
Dude,
my feelings were,

2568
01:50:30,340 --> 01:50:31,540
I was at the press conference.

2569
01:50:31,690 --> 01:50:34,480
Super sad panda.
like I lost the fight.

2570
01:50:35,530 --> 01:50:36,810
I felt like crying.
Oh,

2571
01:50:36,940 --> 01:50:40,000
gets 50 g's back.
Like damn son,

2572
01:50:40,060 --> 01:50:42,070
50,000 sizzla bitch.
We go,

2573
01:50:42,310 --> 01:50:47,310
we don't benihanas for everybody here.
50,000 is always 50,000 who you are?

2574
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:48,600
Yeah,
it's always 50 grand.

2575
01:50:48,601 --> 01:50:50,440
It's a lot when you're a struggling
father.

2576
01:50:50,470 --> 01:50:52,600
Fifty gs.
You're like,

2577
01:50:52,601 --> 01:50:54,340
damn I,
should I buy a rolls royce?

2578
01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:56,320
Should I get that mansion?
Like you don't realize,

2579
01:50:56,321 --> 01:50:57,520
you know,
I'm like,

2580
01:50:57,550 --> 01:51:00,400
should I buy a place in naples?
Ah,

2581
01:51:00,430 --> 01:51:03,040
we'll see.
Let's talk to the financial advisor.

2582
01:51:04,120 --> 01:51:07,510
this is the one fight where I'm,
I'm a big fan of tj as a person.

2583
01:51:07,511 --> 01:51:09,700
I liked that dude a lot.
Fucking love him.

2584
01:51:09,790 --> 01:51:11,710
I love him as well.
I'm looking at this fight and mark.

2585
01:51:11,711 --> 01:51:13,690
Woo.
This is a tough fight.

2586
01:51:14,020 --> 01:51:18,250
This is a very tough part.
I might be the the one of the more

2587
01:51:18,251 --> 01:51:21,370
difficult fight to call in the card,
but here's the thing.

2588
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:24,850
When tj fought hoffeld sun sal the first
time,

2589
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:29,830
he was a very different fighters.
pre bang ludwig who was a different guy

2590
01:51:30,040 --> 01:51:32,500
and it was in Brazil and it was barely
one.

2591
01:51:32,530 --> 01:51:33,700
Yeah.
Yeah.

2592
01:51:34,360 --> 01:51:35,860
Tough fight.
But a son sow.

2593
01:51:35,980 --> 01:51:37,740
Who is a [inaudible] last victory.
Jamie,

2594
01:51:38,220 --> 01:51:40,220
please trim up that lower region.
So.

2595
01:51:40,240 --> 01:51:40,481
No,
no,

2596
01:51:40,481 --> 01:51:41,470
no.
Keep it furry.

2597
01:51:41,640 --> 01:51:42,371
Cute.
Referring.

2598
01:51:42,371 --> 01:51:46,240
So you guys that brazilian forest on
this furry and stinky and stanky

2599
01:51:48,020 --> 01:51:49,410
Norway.
That's a fucking.

2600
01:51:49,660 --> 01:51:54,160
When he beat caraway munoz.
Jim when?

2601
01:51:54,190 --> 01:51:55,540
Yeah,
he's no joke man.

2602
01:51:55,570 --> 01:51:57,400
He had a lot oF time off though.
Cause the injuries.

2603
01:51:57,460 --> 01:51:58,330
Yeah.
Look at that man.

2604
01:51:58,510 --> 01:52:03,510
He fought dillashaw only two fights ago
to [inaudible] crate and then his last

2605
01:52:03,821 --> 01:52:06,910
fight with two,
2014 against caraway and that the care

2606
01:52:06,950 --> 01:52:10,060
was tough as nails.
He beat von [inaudible] by submission.

2607
01:52:10,061 --> 01:52:11,470
Vons.
Good submission guy too.

2608
01:52:12,010 --> 01:52:15,790
And then a split decision versus tj,
which was the close fight,

2609
01:52:16,090 --> 01:52:21,070
unanimous versus pedro munoz.
And then beat brian caraway and other

2610
01:52:21,071 --> 01:52:23,500
unanimous decision.
Look tobar fourth,

2611
01:52:23,501 --> 01:52:25,210
tWo thousand 14.
Yeah,

2612
01:52:25,270 --> 01:52:27,370
it was a long time.
Long ass fucking time,

2613
01:52:27,371 --> 01:52:30,010
man.
You shouldn't see what tj is the huge

2614
01:52:30,011 --> 01:52:32,110
favorite.
Well he definitely should be.

2615
01:52:32,170 --> 01:52:35,710
You should be a favorite,
but I can't imagine the sun sal hasn't

2616
01:52:35,711 --> 01:52:36,790
been.
I mean,

2617
01:52:37,420 --> 01:52:40,690
first of all got better for sure.
If he's been training

2618
01:52:42,970 --> 01:52:44,620
with the lights.
Sizzling hot,

2619
01:52:44,750 --> 01:52:45,630
you know fans.

2620
01:52:46,030 --> 01:52:47,330
Sheri leaman.
Yeah.

2621
01:52:47,331 --> 01:52:49,210
And he's not going to be in Brazil.
Yup.

2622
01:52:49,520 --> 01:52:51,620
What does that mean and what does it
mean?

2623
01:52:52,460 --> 01:52:54,380
You tell me.
What does it mean?

2624
01:52:55,680 --> 01:52:59,670
What is that face?
You guys down there?

2625
01:52:59,720 --> 01:53:02,900
If you have a lock on this card,
what's the log?

2626
01:53:03,200 --> 01:53:05,030
A jon jones.
Really?

2627
01:53:05,170 --> 01:53:06,200
Yeah.
Wow.

2628
01:53:06,230 --> 01:53:07,880
By far.
Wow.

2629
01:53:09,110 --> 01:53:12,380
Interesting.
Because you look like you go through it.

2630
01:53:12,710 --> 01:53:15,360
John's btc before.
It's pretty easy for them.

2631
01:53:15,480 --> 01:53:17,930
You will get less than.
I do not think it's easy for them at

2632
01:53:17,931 --> 01:53:18,890
all.
Not easy.

2633
01:53:18,891 --> 01:53:21,380
I'm saying how great john is.
Yes,

2634
01:53:22,310 --> 01:53:23,840
that's my lock man.
All right.

2635
01:53:23,870 --> 01:53:25,640
And then lesnar hunt,
it's like,

2636
01:53:25,641 --> 01:53:28,400
I don't fucking know hunt if he gets his
ass down.

2637
01:53:28,470 --> 01:53:33,470
Well hunting fucking trouble trouble if,
if brock just bullies his way in and

2638
01:53:34,220 --> 01:53:38,570
blast doubles his asked to next friday
and then drops those lunchboxes on his

2639
01:53:38,571 --> 01:53:40,340
head and we're still hunt out.

2640
01:53:40,340 --> 01:53:42,980
So his.
So his fucking power's not there.

2641
01:53:43,010 --> 01:53:44,420
Yeah.
So that one,

2642
01:53:44,480 --> 01:53:46,220
I don't know.
They can go either way.

2643
01:53:46,460 --> 01:53:48,470
And then tate nunez.
Good luck picking that.

2644
01:53:48,650 --> 01:53:50,420
Although edgar space,
even money,

2645
01:53:50,740 --> 01:53:52,830
you don't think tate is a favorite
intake nunez?

2646
01:53:52,910 --> 01:53:54,800
Oh she is for sure.
But it's still,

2647
01:53:54,801 --> 01:53:56,060
it's a tough fight.
Tough fight.

2648
01:53:56,340 --> 01:53:58,130
The tough.
I can knock out anybody.

2649
01:53:58,190 --> 01:54:02,090
I really believe that that piston
righthand that she hid a sara mcmann

2650
01:54:02,091 --> 01:54:04,340
with woo.
And then mischa's a slow starter.

2651
01:54:04,341 --> 01:54:05,180
So it's,
you know,

2652
01:54:05,250 --> 01:54:08,690
if she eats was huge.
Fucking righthand nunez can grapple to

2653
01:54:08,780 --> 01:54:10,850
she.
She's a black belt but I still give me

2654
01:54:10,851 --> 01:54:12,230
sure.
The advantage on the ground that's

2655
01:54:12,231 --> 01:54:14,000
interesting in wrestling.
Right?

2656
01:54:14,001 --> 01:54:17,420
And scrambles grappling or just overall
mma grappling.

2657
01:54:17,450 --> 01:54:20,330
She's as tough as fucking nails did the
hollY.

2658
01:54:20,630 --> 01:54:23,900
That shit was so impressive man.
Like she's just waiting for.

2659
01:54:24,200 --> 01:54:25,280
It was so impressive.

2660
01:54:25,820 --> 01:54:27,890
So that fight stuff to call.
Although edgar,

2661
01:54:27,950 --> 01:54:31,100
good luck with that luck with that good
luck column that we don't know who the

2662
01:54:31,101 --> 01:54:33,050
fuck aldo is right now.
No idea.

2663
01:54:33,140 --> 01:54:35,690
We reallY need to find out.
You might be on the revenge tour and

2664
01:54:35,691 --> 01:54:37,410
just merge.
Frankie,

2665
01:54:37,480 --> 01:54:40,250
who grabs the mic and calls out connor,
who knows,

2666
01:54:40,280 --> 01:54:42,230
but I just don't see american frankie.
I don't think.

2667
01:54:42,250 --> 01:54:44,300
I don't see anybody at 1:45 murking
frank.

2668
01:54:44,301 --> 01:54:44,901
No,
me neither.

2669
01:54:44,901 --> 01:54:46,390
Man was trying to create drama here.
Yeah,

2670
01:54:46,460 --> 01:54:49,250
I don't see that man.
I see it at frankie at 1:45 is a

2671
01:54:49,251 --> 01:54:51,340
monster.
She just merck.

2672
01:54:51,350 --> 01:54:55,460
Chad and he's just better than ever.
Just keeps getting better and better and

2673
01:54:55,461 --> 01:54:56,530
better.
That's where you belong.

2674
01:54:56,531 --> 01:54:57,980
So yeAh,
45.

2675
01:54:58,150 --> 01:54:59,360
Look at his footwork.
Cardio,

2676
01:54:59,361 --> 01:54:59,991
everything.
He's not.

2677
01:54:59,991 --> 01:55:02,390
He was struggling to make 45.
He could make 35.

2678
01:55:02,420 --> 01:55:06,650
He's a 35 or you look at the size of him
in comparison to like tj and a lot of

2679
01:55:06,651 --> 01:55:08,840
those guys who were already five.
That's his weight class.

2680
01:55:08,870 --> 01:55:10,760
I agree.
He might eventually go down there too,

2681
01:55:10,761 --> 01:55:12,710
by the way.
He's talked about it,

2682
01:55:12,890 --> 01:55:13,820
you know,
fucking gray.

2683
01:55:13,821 --> 01:55:17,990
Maynard is fighting this week at one.
I Think he's fighting featherweight.

2684
01:55:18,230 --> 01:55:18,891
What?
Gray?

2685
01:55:18,891 --> 01:55:20,790
Maine.
It's fine at feather away.

2686
01:55:20,860 --> 01:55:24,620
Dare just let that soak in.
Where in the ufc

2687
01:55:26,440 --> 01:55:30,640
what gray maynard.
Pretty sure he must be fighting on the

2688
01:55:30,641 --> 01:55:35,641
undercard of the friday night fights.
Unless,

2689
01:55:35,651 --> 01:55:38,860
unless this brain trauma kicked in.
I'm making shit up now.

2690
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:44,130
No parents.
Look at that gray

2691
01:55:44,260 --> 01:55:47,160
maynard is fighting.
Fernando bruno.

2692
01:55:47,340 --> 01:55:49,740
Whoa.
That's at featherweight.

2693
01:55:49,950 --> 01:55:51,840
Wow.
That's interesting man.

2694
01:55:52,070 --> 01:55:55,590
He got and he was a huge 50 fiver like
bulk lies.

2695
01:55:55,680 --> 01:55:59,040
Yeah.
Well he was carrying way too much meat

2696
01:55:59,070 --> 01:56:00,420
for sure.
And that was,

2697
01:56:01,290 --> 01:56:02,730
that was probably a big factor

2698
01:56:04,450 --> 01:56:09,450
in a lot of his uh,
his decision to get lean was the ivy

2699
01:56:09,880 --> 01:56:13,840
ban.
You being that big at 1:55 and having

2700
01:56:13,841 --> 01:56:16,630
all that bulk on them,
he probably decided to lean out and then

2701
01:56:16,631 --> 01:56:18,220
as he was leaning out it was probably
like,

2702
01:56:18,221 --> 01:56:20,830
you know what,
with his frame and its power and might

2703
01:56:20,831 --> 01:56:25,590
even be better at 1:45.
But he was just so much things that god

2704
01:56:25,591 --> 01:56:29,170
damn bully 50 fiber,
that's because he likes those dogs.

2705
01:56:29,210 --> 01:56:30,760
I was bullied dogs.
I get it.

2706
01:56:30,761 --> 01:56:32,260
But still,
he's the thick dude.

2707
01:56:32,320 --> 01:56:34,360
He was a thick,
but it was all muscle.

2708
01:56:34,660 --> 01:56:36,850
The only muscle.
Look on his,

2709
01:56:36,910 --> 01:56:39,220
his length please.
And then you lose that muscle and now

2710
01:56:39,221 --> 01:56:40,730
you've got 45.
And really it's,

2711
01:56:40,830 --> 01:56:42,310
you know,
his chin's been suspect.

2712
01:56:42,311 --> 01:56:46,960
So he cuts the 45 more than suspect.
I mean it's all your shit.

2713
01:56:46,990 --> 01:56:48,190
He's lost four in a row.

2714
01:56:48,220 --> 01:56:48,961
That shit went.
Boom,

2715
01:56:48,961 --> 01:56:49,411
boom,
boom,

2716
01:56:49,411 --> 01:56:50,170
boom.
The,

2717
01:56:50,170 --> 01:56:54,490
at least the last one was a decision.
Last one was in 2012,

2718
01:56:54,491 --> 01:56:57,670
so I know.
And he lost three by kao in a row.

2719
01:56:59,160 --> 01:57:00,700
Ross pearson,
odom,

2720
01:57:00,840 --> 01:57:02,380
which,
and it was ugly.

2721
01:57:02,500 --> 01:57:07,500
Nate diaz beat the fuck out of him.
That was a first round kl and tj grant

2722
01:57:08,470 --> 01:57:10,690
beat the fuck out of him.
Tj grant.

2723
01:57:10,691 --> 01:57:13,120
Here's a guy about to fight for the
title,

2724
01:57:13,450 --> 01:57:16,030
gets a concussion,
has to delay it.

2725
01:57:16,150 --> 01:57:19,690
And now he works in a mine.
He's done.

2726
01:57:20,570 --> 01:57:24,240
I saw him the other day.
He was there for someone's fight.

2727
01:57:24,250 --> 01:57:27,010
I forget who it was,
but he looks like he hasn't been

2728
01:57:27,011 --> 01:57:28,480
trained.
It looks thick,

2729
01:57:28,870 --> 01:57:30,760
like it's just been thicker than a
snickers.

2730
01:57:31,180 --> 01:57:35,380
Just fucking mind.
A very skillful guy to man and smart guy

2731
01:57:35,381 --> 01:57:36,240
too.
Very smart.

2732
01:57:36,280 --> 01:57:37,660
well,
that's why he's not fighting anymore.

2733
01:57:37,870 --> 01:57:38,451
You know,
he's not,

2734
01:57:38,451 --> 01:57:41,470
he's not a guy who takes concussions
lightly.

2735
01:57:41,800 --> 01:57:46,000
He stays there for hara as another guy
that looked fucking sensational at one

2736
01:57:46,001 --> 01:57:48,010
point in his career and his,
uh,

2737
01:57:48,130 --> 01:57:50,590
started to fade.
One of the biggest freaks ever seen

2738
01:57:50,591 --> 01:57:54,610
inside the gym for arrow.
Click on that fucking freak.

2739
01:57:55,190 --> 01:57:57,100
Yeah.
Who did he just lose to go click on his.

2740
01:57:57,130 --> 01:57:58,520
He's,
this is a middle way,

2741
01:57:58,521 --> 01:57:59,560
right?
Because you fight in middleweight.

2742
01:57:59,561 --> 01:58:00,131
Yeah.
Yeah.

2743
01:58:00,131 --> 01:58:03,610
He got knocked out his last fight.
Do you fight?

2744
01:58:06,070 --> 01:58:07,720
Oh yeah.
Bamboo say.

2745
01:58:07,980 --> 01:58:09,970
Oh no.
We saw them lose the Missouri model.

2746
01:58:10,090 --> 01:58:10,960
That's right.
Yeah.

2747
01:58:10,961 --> 01:58:13,180
We saw them lose some mazda.
Your code.

2748
01:58:13,570 --> 01:58:17,110
And then sam also,
while they bamboo say beaten by

2749
01:58:17,111 --> 01:58:18,900
decision,
but mazda dot kao them.

2750
01:58:19,150 --> 01:58:21,160
Click on watch that.
I don't even remember that.

2751
01:58:22,150 --> 01:58:23,350
Yeah.
Click on watch.

2752
01:58:24,790 --> 01:58:27,470
He gets in these slug fest to make us
sign up for five west.

2753
01:58:27,480 --> 01:58:30,590
We should be signed up already know.
Oh son,

2754
01:58:30,630 --> 01:58:33,250
what's up?
We can't show it on the podcast,

2755
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:34,510
but we could watch it,
right.

2756
01:58:35,170 --> 01:58:38,980
Just it's a first round kao.
I just want to see how knocked him out.

2757
01:58:39,280 --> 01:58:42,700
He's so aThletic and he's good at
everything

2758
01:58:42,870 --> 01:58:45,400
he was.
He was to allege under amston silva for

2759
01:58:45,401 --> 01:58:48,700
years.
Then the little machida leo machida and

2760
01:58:48,701 --> 01:58:51,850
then be tour bell for like everyone
invest all this time and because he's

2761
01:58:51,851 --> 01:58:54,760
such a freak inside the gym,
housing outside of the students ever

2762
01:58:54,761 --> 01:58:56,530
going to lose.
And then he goes on the ultimate

2763
01:58:56,531 --> 01:58:59,080
fighter.
He's Just a monster,

2764
01:58:59,300 --> 01:59:02,200
but for a reason.
It's just not clicking for them in the

2765
01:59:02,201 --> 01:59:05,080
right now.
While he won the ultimate fighter and a

2766
01:59:05,081 --> 01:59:07,720
in the finals.
He fought our surgery more eyes.

2767
01:59:07,721 --> 01:59:09,880
The jujItsu black belt.
Who um,

2768
01:59:10,090 --> 01:59:14,660
he's the guy who tapped out.
I'm kron gracie and crohn's first black

2769
01:59:14,661 --> 01:59:15,431
belt match.
She,

2770
01:59:15,431 --> 01:59:20,431
sergio marTinez is a beast.
he is a world world class.

2771
01:59:21,220 --> 01:59:26,080
Black belt brazilian jujitsu.
But a mariah's caught ses are for heroin

2772
01:59:26,110 --> 01:59:28,860
with a hard elbow,
I believe in that fight and have.

2773
01:59:28,870 --> 01:59:31,870
I'm stunned because I remember I watched
it.

2774
01:59:32,050 --> 01:59:34,280
I was in Brazil for that one there.
There's,

2775
01:59:34,330 --> 01:59:37,180
there's a couple guys that I've trained
with and I'm just like,

2776
01:59:37,181 --> 01:59:38,620
dude,
these guys are gonna take over the

2777
01:59:38,621 --> 01:59:39,700
world.
Todd duffy.

2778
01:59:40,950 --> 01:59:43,210
I asked canaan dc because he went,
he left our camp.

2779
01:59:43,211 --> 01:59:44,800
One of them like,
how tough is duffy?

2780
01:59:44,801 --> 01:59:48,280
Like unbelievable man.
How'd that they get fucking robocop?

2781
01:59:48,760 --> 01:59:52,660
Maybe just need some like vinny shoreman
type mental coaching or something.

2782
01:59:52,661 --> 01:59:53,960
You know?
I mean there's,

2783
01:59:53,980 --> 01:59:55,210
there's been guys like that,
you know,

2784
01:59:55,211 --> 01:59:56,260
in football too.
You're like,

2785
01:59:56,261 --> 01:59:58,990
holy fuck,
this guy's gonna rush for 3000 yards.

2786
01:59:59,020 --> 02:00:01,350
Then the lights turn on and it's like,
what the fuck happened though?

2787
02:00:01,390 --> 02:00:03,610
Well,
duffy's fight against frank mir was just

2788
02:00:03,611 --> 02:00:04,690
real crazy.
Like,

2789
02:00:04,691 --> 02:00:07,900
what a nutty fucking slug fest.
Those too sick.

2790
02:00:08,020 --> 02:00:09,460
What?
Just let's go.

2791
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:13,450
And to think that frank mir decided to
fight like that after all these years in

2792
02:00:13,451 --> 02:00:16,570
the game,
all his submission victories,

2793
02:00:16,571 --> 02:00:19,250
all his crazy fights against world class
fighters.

2794
02:00:19,660 --> 02:00:20,680
He just said,
you know what?

2795
02:00:20,930 --> 02:00:23,890
Let's fucking,
he's in love with box right now.

2796
02:00:23,920 --> 02:00:25,600
All I talked about blogs and I'm like,
for sure.

2797
02:00:25,601 --> 02:00:26,434
Jump.
God,

2798
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:27,610
that's so weird,
man.

2799
02:00:27,670 --> 02:00:30,460
Pharaoh.
So for harris trYing to pass here and

2800
02:00:30,461 --> 02:00:32,830
somehow or another in this fight,
he gets knocked out.

2801
02:00:33,190 --> 02:00:36,640
I don't remember What the time was.
There's vitorin his corner.

2802
02:00:38,230 --> 02:00:42,090
He's bodied up and he did,
he did that cap or a and he can like,

2803
02:00:42,100 --> 02:00:44,200
he can do it to a t like a fucking
break,

2804
02:00:44,201 --> 02:00:46,310
just anywhere.
Flips all this shit.

2805
02:00:46,311 --> 02:00:49,090
And he's big too.
He saw athletic man,

2806
02:00:49,091 --> 02:00:50,920
the nicest guy.
If,

2807
02:00:51,140 --> 02:00:54,220
if he got his fucking head right man
playing the guy has the skills to do

2808
02:00:54,221 --> 02:00:55,940
crazy things and you think that's what
it is.

2809
02:00:55,941 --> 02:00:57,790
It's a head thing.
100 percent.

2810
02:00:57,970 --> 02:01:01,430
He's got tagged on the break there by,
by a

2811
02:01:03,390 --> 02:01:05,770
tough fight for them to this young in
his career.

2812
02:01:05,840 --> 02:01:09,130
Mazda was very crisp.
He's fucking vet.

2813
02:01:09,240 --> 02:01:11,290
Yeah.
Very crisp with his striking though.

2814
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:13,660
I'm like,
I'm a big fan of the way he uh,

2815
02:01:14,020 --> 02:01:17,980
he throws punches like fast and
accurate,

2816
02:01:18,190 --> 02:01:21,160
but it doesn't load up on anything.
I feel like it gets there.

2817
02:01:21,550 --> 02:01:24,340
Yeah.
I feel like because he has a pro box and

2818
02:01:24,350 --> 02:01:26,700
experiences,
I feel like whenever go the decision

2819
02:01:26,710 --> 02:01:30,790
moskva dog gets fucked.
HE does get fucked every time he's won.

2820
02:01:31,390 --> 02:01:32,720
He's one of my favorite fighters to
watch.

2821
02:01:32,721 --> 02:01:35,620
She's good at everything was very smart.
Very smart dude.

2822
02:01:35,650 --> 02:01:38,260
He was a kimbo slice this fight back
yard.

2823
02:01:38,470 --> 02:01:39,990
Yeah.
In those early days,

2824
02:01:39,990 --> 02:01:41,750
man,
I've watched some of his fights before,

2825
02:01:41,810 --> 02:01:45,710
long before he ever came to the ufc.
Back when he was fighting even words in

2826
02:01:45,720 --> 02:01:47,750
bodog fight member that.
Oh yeah.

2827
02:01:48,140 --> 02:01:50,990
He caught eve edwards with a head kick.
Knocked them out and bodog

2828
02:01:52,520 --> 02:01:53,560
bodog.
Yeah.

2829
02:01:53,650 --> 02:01:55,640
Well that's cool man.
So detail son.

2830
02:01:55,650 --> 02:01:58,610
Another guy named jeremiah constant.
Yes.

2831
02:01:58,630 --> 02:02:01,100
Son and funded to postdoc at the hottest
ring.

2832
02:02:01,110 --> 02:02:04,030
Girls out.
Fuck was,

2833
02:02:05,130 --> 02:02:07,190
you know,
putin had a hand in that,

2834
02:02:07,280 --> 02:02:10,640
but if I could just get one night with
puente and paint the town red.

2835
02:02:11,930 --> 02:02:12,890
Do you remember?
Or white?

2836
02:02:13,070 --> 02:02:15,810
Do you remember that?
Calvin icing icing.

2837
02:02:15,830 --> 02:02:18,890
I do that calvin ira guy who owned
bodog.

2838
02:02:19,310 --> 02:02:22,070
Yes.
He was a guy who wasn't even allowed to

2839
02:02:22,071 --> 02:02:27,071
come back to America because he wasn't
involved in internet gambling because

2840
02:02:28,531 --> 02:02:30,590
the internet gambling used to be
completely legit,

2841
02:02:30,860 --> 02:02:33,980
but the casinos fucking bribed.

2842
02:02:33,980 --> 02:02:35,420
Everybody went,
fuck,

2843
02:02:35,450 --> 02:02:36,670
stop this.
Stop it.

2844
02:02:36,680 --> 02:02:39,590
Eaters.
They ruined what could have been an

2845
02:02:39,591 --> 02:02:42,200
amazing marketplace.
huge,

2846
02:02:42,290 --> 02:02:45,140
amazing.
But they wanted to preserve casinos in

2847
02:02:45,141 --> 02:02:47,360
the United States.
And especially when it comes to sports

2848
02:02:47,361 --> 02:02:49,970
betting and things along those lines.
So calvin,

2849
02:02:49,971 --> 02:02:54,620
I or he got fucked as did a.
what's that guy's name?

2850
02:02:54,621 --> 02:02:58,880
Kevin trudeau.
Remember that guy that fucking the 10

2851
02:02:58,881 --> 02:03:01,310
weight loss secrets that they don't want
you to know about.

2852
02:03:01,311 --> 02:03:04,750
Remember that guy,
those late night infomercial swindles

2853
02:03:04,810 --> 02:03:08,210
were swindled people and weight loss
tips like that turned out to all be

2854
02:03:08,211 --> 02:03:10,670
bullshit.
The guy was a swindler,

2855
02:03:10,671 --> 02:03:14,090
but he got fucked too because he started
something called the international pool

2856
02:03:14,100 --> 02:03:14,661
tour.
Oh,

2857
02:03:14,661 --> 02:03:15,770
right hand.
That's what it is.

2858
02:03:15,800 --> 02:03:18,410
Oh dude.
Oh dude.

2859
02:03:18,560 --> 02:03:20,540
Mosbey doll.
He's a beast.

2860
02:03:20,570 --> 02:03:23,120
So he,
a trudeau started this thing called the

2861
02:03:23,121 --> 02:03:24,540
international prob,
uh,

2862
02:03:25,100 --> 02:03:27,860
international pool tour,
I thinK it was,

2863
02:03:27,861 --> 02:03:30,530
or ipt,
international professional,

2864
02:03:30,540 --> 02:03:31,373
whatever the fuck it was.

2865
02:03:31,700 --> 02:03:35,870
But it was a pro pool organization,
spent a ton of money on it.

2866
02:03:35,900 --> 02:03:36,950
It's terrible.
It is now,

2867
02:03:36,951 --> 02:03:40,430
but the idea behind we'll pool is
enormous and asia and enormous and a lot

2868
02:03:40,431 --> 02:03:44,930
of europe and other parts of the world
and his idea was have online gambling

2869
02:03:45,140 --> 02:03:49,450
and the online gambling would,
would people would bet on who was going

2870
02:03:49,451 --> 02:03:53,750
to win each match and they would make
their profits off that as he was putting

2871
02:03:53,751 --> 02:03:57,920
this together that came down.
The band on online gambling just crushed

2872
02:03:57,921 --> 02:03:59,870
it.
The Whole business got crushed.

2873
02:03:59,871 --> 02:04:04,080
He's in jail now for some portion but
hiding money somewhere and he's like,

2874
02:04:04,190 --> 02:04:06,380
he's one of those dudes that's in Jail
and they're like,

2875
02:04:06,381 --> 02:04:07,340
look,
let you out.

2876
02:04:07,341 --> 02:04:09,470
If you tell us where the money is,
fuck you.

2877
02:04:09,510 --> 02:04:11,760
Oh yeah,
you will let me out when you let me out.

2878
02:04:11,761 --> 02:04:14,510
And then I'm going to go right to that
fucking coffee can that I got buried in

2879
02:04:14,511 --> 02:04:15,344
my backyard.

2880
02:04:15,670 --> 02:04:18,650
Dude.
I felt slimy watching bodog like you

2881
02:04:18,651 --> 02:04:20,900
knew this,
like some weird shit going on.

2882
02:04:21,050 --> 02:04:22,850
It was so strange,
man.

2883
02:04:22,910 --> 02:04:27,910
I don't think they paid matt lindland.
I think matt lindland got fucked,

2884
02:04:28,010 --> 02:04:31,350
if I remember correctly,
or it didn't get paid all that there

2885
02:04:31,351 --> 02:04:33,620
were supposed to pay him because lynn,
lynn,

2886
02:04:34,830 --> 02:04:38,640
lynn lynn was supposed to get like a
million bucks to fader member that

2887
02:04:39,150 --> 02:04:42,990
lindland fought fader and fader cheated.
Remember that?

2888
02:04:43,160 --> 02:04:45,260
Linda?
Matt lindland had a body lock on.

2889
02:04:45,270 --> 02:04:49,620
I'm just taking him down.
Your fucking hooked the rope and totally

2890
02:04:49,621 --> 02:04:52,290
cheating.
Reverse the position and then went to

2891
02:04:52,291 --> 02:04:53,970
work and then went to work and armbar
them.

2892
02:04:54,150 --> 02:04:55,850
That's right.
Ain't no.

2893
02:04:56,100 --> 02:04:58,080
Once I went to the ground,
he did what he's supposed to do,

2894
02:04:58,081 --> 02:05:03,081
but you fucking cheated to get there.
He definitely cheated mother Russia and

2895
02:05:03,871 --> 02:05:05,950
this was when fader was fade or to did.

2896
02:05:05,970 --> 02:05:09,600
I used to use boat.
I used to use it to bet on sports.

2897
02:05:09,780 --> 02:05:10,613
Really?
Yeah.

2898
02:05:11,220 --> 02:05:14,490
Well that dude,
when he was had bodog fight,

2899
02:05:14,820 --> 02:05:19,530
he had a giant billboard just outside of
vegas for bodog fight,

2900
02:05:19,531 --> 02:05:20,880
you know?
It was on the billboard.

2901
02:05:21,930 --> 02:05:26,190
Him in a suit type mo.
These motherfuckers versions do it here

2902
02:05:26,191 --> 02:05:28,950
in la.
We shouldn't do that because first of

2903
02:05:28,951 --> 02:05:31,500
all,
he's already rich as fuck.

2904
02:05:33,120 --> 02:05:34,770
How much pussy do you need?
Dude,

2905
02:05:35,250 --> 02:05:38,520
you're going to have a surplus of pussy
and then you're gonna have problems

2906
02:05:38,521 --> 02:05:40,680
because paid for it.
Now plotting against you,

2907
02:05:40,681 --> 02:05:42,750
the pussy is going to be overflowing,
left and right.

2908
02:05:42,751 --> 02:05:44,100
You're not gonna.
Be able to keep a hand on it.

2909
02:05:44,360 --> 02:05:45,340
Shouldn't get in the way.
I'm gonna.

2910
02:05:45,350 --> 02:05:46,950
Get in the way.
You're thinking you're going to be.

2911
02:05:46,951 --> 02:05:48,600
I know this motherfucker.
You got fighters.

2912
02:05:48,601 --> 02:05:50,400
You got a bunch of fighters and you can
guess what?

2913
02:05:50,400 --> 02:05:52,980
They're fucking all those girls cry.
Bitch,

2914
02:05:53,340 --> 02:05:54,400
what are you doing?
You need to.

2915
02:05:54,401 --> 02:05:56,610
You need an advisor and it weird.
Famous guy.

2916
02:05:56,670 --> 02:05:58,740
Well,
it's like rich guys want to get famous.

2917
02:05:58,940 --> 02:06:00,530
Yes they do.
Yeah.

2918
02:06:00,540 --> 02:06:04,350
A lot of them do a lot of reason why
that Glenn Robinson went blackzilians

2919
02:06:04,351 --> 02:06:05,760
and get the stable effect.
You get enough money.

2920
02:06:05,761 --> 02:06:07,260
What the fuck you're doing?
I don't to do that.

2921
02:06:07,261 --> 02:06:12,261
Why did he go on television was a big
fat face on the ultimate fighter.

2922
02:06:13,330 --> 02:06:14,910
Fuck it.
We're dan lambert.

2923
02:06:14,911 --> 02:06:16,560
Just lambasted him.
Yeah,

2924
02:06:16,590 --> 02:06:18,120
he did destroy it.
Just destroyed.

2925
02:06:18,121 --> 02:06:20,670
Just chewed them apart and glenn
couldn't say anything.

2926
02:06:20,730 --> 02:06:21,563
Was he going to.
You can't,

2927
02:06:21,600 --> 02:06:25,440
like dan could legitimately beat the
fuck out of many times he wants like in

2928
02:06:25,441 --> 02:06:27,420
real life.
So it's like you can't,

2929
02:06:27,470 --> 02:06:30,390
there's not a lot of insults.
He could lay his when.

2930
02:06:30,430 --> 02:06:32,400
I mean just the whole,
hey,

2931
02:06:32,490 --> 02:06:33,780
who's idea was that?

2932
02:06:34,010 --> 02:06:37,620
I mean ultimately it's good for the
teams to show like who's the better,

2933
02:06:38,080 --> 02:06:39,270
you know,
what's the better team?

2934
02:06:39,271 --> 02:06:41,750
Who's got the better athletes?
Just get the better fighters and coach

2935
02:06:41,790 --> 02:06:43,170
jaylen's won that season,
right?

2936
02:06:43,190 --> 02:06:43,680
Yeah,
they did.

2937
02:06:43,680 --> 02:06:44,580
Yeah.
How'd that turn out?

2938
02:06:45,150 --> 02:06:49,460
Bitches bankrupt now.
He spent a lot of money doing what?

2939
02:06:49,500 --> 02:06:51,240
A bad idea.
It's not a good idea,

2940
02:06:51,630 --> 02:06:54,270
but bodog fight went under and I don't
know why it went under,

2941
02:06:54,271 --> 02:06:57,450
but they,
the guy was like mocking dana and he was

2942
02:06:57,610 --> 02:06:59,280
saying at one point in time,
you know,

2943
02:06:59,281 --> 02:07:03,690
that he would like to take dana with him
on his jet setting lifestyle and show

2944
02:07:03,691 --> 02:07:04,201
him,
you know,

2945
02:07:04,201 --> 02:07:08,580
I invited him to pick him up in his
private jet and so dana could see like

2946
02:07:08,610 --> 02:07:12,460
how he lives and what fuck it was back
before the ufc.

2947
02:07:12,461 --> 02:07:16,650
He really became the ufc in air quotes,
you know,

2948
02:07:17,080 --> 02:07:17,913
still.
Yeah,

2949
02:07:17,940 --> 02:07:18,920
still grow.
See,

2950
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:21,080
but is that real?
I don't know if that's real.

2951
02:07:21,081 --> 02:07:23,640
There's so much confidentiality.
Nobody wants to give me a fucking

2952
02:07:23,641 --> 02:07:25,440
straight story.
I would assume it's real.

2953
02:07:25,590 --> 02:07:28,020
Where there's smoke,
there's fire and because it's weird.

2954
02:07:28,021 --> 02:07:30,150
They offered 4 billion and dana was
like,

2955
02:07:30,151 --> 02:07:31,620
effort.
You left for 4 billion.

2956
02:07:31,830 --> 02:07:33,210
I think if somebody offers you 4
billion,

2957
02:07:33,211 --> 02:07:34,080
you've got to say yes.

2958
02:07:36,060 --> 02:07:37,420
Hell yes.
Good luck.

2959
02:07:37,421 --> 02:07:38,860
Scratched together.
4 billion.

2960
02:07:39,130 --> 02:07:42,220
Like there was a number of partners,
but even then,

2961
02:07:42,280 --> 02:07:46,020
good luck scratching again at 4 billion.
It's a lot of money and you know,

2962
02:07:46,030 --> 02:07:47,590
you got to make sure that everything's
in place.

2963
02:07:48,160 --> 02:07:51,850
I mean,
it's a tricky thing.

2964
02:07:52,270 --> 02:07:53,320
You.
First of all,

2965
02:07:53,321 --> 02:07:55,900
you'd have to have dana stay on.
You have to have dana.

2966
02:07:56,170 --> 02:07:58,690
Without dana,
you don't have the same organization.

2967
02:07:59,080 --> 02:08:01,390
You're not going to be able to put
together the fights the same way.

2968
02:08:01,690 --> 02:08:02,980
You know,
you don't have the same guy doing the

2969
02:08:02,981 --> 02:08:04,900
press conferences,
the same figurehead.

2970
02:08:04,930 --> 02:08:06,350
It's very important.
Stolen.

2971
02:08:06,370 --> 02:08:09,400
Why would you buy it?
Anyone that with that ego,

2972
02:08:09,401 --> 02:08:12,150
if they have 4 billion or get these
three mega companies,

2973
02:08:12,151 --> 02:08:15,640
the other by 3 billion or 4 billion,
they're going to have other ideas for

2974
02:08:15,641 --> 02:08:19,690
the organization so you can't buy it and
then just leaving all the same.

2975
02:08:19,900 --> 02:08:24,900
You buy it and you give dana a piece,
so not only do you pay him,

2976
02:08:25,030 --> 02:08:28,540
but you also give him a piece of the new
organization so that he can get even

2977
02:08:28,541 --> 02:08:31,570
stupid richer.
You came a piece,

2978
02:08:31,571 --> 02:08:33,070
but you're going to have to have someone
like,

2979
02:08:33,071 --> 02:08:36,340
let's say you.
You hire a dude from fucking apple to

2980
02:08:36,341 --> 02:08:39,410
come in and run it.
This grant is not.

2981
02:08:39,610 --> 02:08:42,010
Let's say that's your idea though.
You know what I'm saying?

2982
02:08:42,011 --> 02:08:43,450
Like if you're buying,
you're not buying it like,

2983
02:08:43,630 --> 02:08:44,690
oh yeah,
you just keep doing what you do.

2984
02:08:44,750 --> 02:08:47,050
Your bikes.
You have some ideas like you don't

2985
02:08:47,051 --> 02:08:50,710
become a millionaire because you're
fucking using someone else's ideas.

2986
02:08:50,740 --> 02:08:52,780
Right?
Yeah,

2987
02:08:52,781 --> 02:08:54,550
that's true.
You must have some ideas,

2988
02:08:54,551 --> 02:08:58,990
but it's possible that it's an ego
purchase that a bunch of guys got

2989
02:08:58,991 --> 02:09:00,070
together.
Wouldn't be awesome.

2990
02:09:00,071 --> 02:09:02,020
If we own the ufc and they find out,
okay,

2991
02:09:02,021 --> 02:09:04,480
what's the revenue every year they make
x amount per year,

2992
02:09:05,050 --> 02:09:05,510
you know?

2993
02:09:05,510 --> 02:09:06,190
Uh,
so look,

2994
02:09:06,190 --> 02:09:08,830
if we put together x amount of billions
of dollars,

2995
02:09:08,860 --> 02:09:11,410
they have fight pass.
That brings in a fuck load of money.

2996
02:09:11,411 --> 02:09:14,380
Now fight pass has a lot of members and
they're paying.

2997
02:09:14,381 --> 02:09:16,720
I don't remember how much I,
I'm a member of fight pass.

2998
02:09:16,721 --> 02:09:19,180
I don't remember how much I pay,
but I think it's like nine bucks a month

2999
02:09:19,181 --> 02:09:19,780
or something like that.
Sure.

3000
02:09:19,780 --> 02:09:20,700
That makes sense.
For sure.

3001
02:09:20,701 --> 02:09:22,930
Give to joe rogan for free.
Just pay.

3002
02:09:23,080 --> 02:09:24,190
I pay for a lot of things.
Yeah.

3003
02:09:24,580 --> 02:09:26,840
I don't mind paying.
I hear you for sure.

3004
02:09:26,990 --> 02:09:31,990
My own supplements
I'll get sponsored.

3005
02:09:34,840 --> 02:09:36,270
but um,
this,

3006
02:09:36,280 --> 02:09:40,240
I think that if they were smart they
would,

3007
02:09:40,270 --> 02:09:42,700
they would see that there's a lot of
value in it.

3008
02:09:42,790 --> 02:09:46,390
But is there enough value to come up
with $4,000,000,000 to pay for it?

3009
02:09:47,800 --> 02:09:52,800
I think there's one way to look at this
where someone might say,

3010
02:09:53,610 --> 02:09:55,890
all right,
they've been running it like the goal of

3011
02:09:55,900 --> 02:09:57,030
boy's club let.

3012
02:09:57,110 --> 02:10:00,430
What happens if we didn't make this a
legit league?

3013
02:10:00,550 --> 02:10:02,980
Like you have a commissioner and you
have a fighters' union.

3014
02:10:03,100 --> 02:10:06,310
what if we ran a junior for warming
money?

3015
02:10:07,900 --> 02:10:10,320
I'm just saying that.
I mean you're.

3016
02:10:10,450 --> 02:10:12,520
If you're going to bite,
you have to have a different idea.

3017
02:10:12,760 --> 02:10:15,390
You know what I'm saying?
They can just run it as it is.

3018
02:10:15,410 --> 02:10:18,670
HeY,
can you can scale facility purchase?

3019
02:10:18,700 --> 02:10:20,800
Yeah.
You do the exact same thing and maybe

3020
02:10:20,890 --> 02:10:24,340
with buying it you can nullify the
reebok deal.

3021
02:10:25,540 --> 02:10:27,460
Someone might just fucking hate reebok.
Sorry,

3022
02:10:27,461 --> 02:10:30,280
I'm a bike just to get rid of it.
You just keep doing the same thing.

3023
02:10:30,910 --> 02:10:35,390
It's not a bad idea.
If I for pilling on reebok,

3024
02:10:35,391 --> 02:10:39,800
my buyer to do that,
What have we done?

3025
02:10:39,810 --> 02:10:42,980
Joint.
Just get someone else take this over.

3026
02:10:43,740 --> 02:10:45,520
So mad at us.
So much.

3027
02:10:45,940 --> 02:10:46,773
So much.
Hey,

3028
02:10:46,980 --> 02:10:49,290
we haven't seen a kitten years on the
streets.

3029
02:10:49,350 --> 02:10:49,800
Will do.

3030
02:10:49,800 --> 02:10:53,070
There was issues with the crossfit folks
to really.

3031
02:10:53,071 --> 02:10:53,551
Yeah,
yeah,

3032
02:10:53,551 --> 02:10:55,170
yeah.
I know one of the dudes at andy stumpf

3033
02:10:55,171 --> 02:10:57,060
was involved in that crossfit.

3034
02:10:58,820 --> 02:11:01,580
Ed edwards was telling me he doesn't
even know if ufc.

3035
02:11:01,790 --> 02:11:03,820
He's like,
who the fuck is wearing reply,

3036
02:11:05,710 --> 02:11:09,380
we a beat this thing to death.
I didn't bring it up,

3037
02:11:09,381 --> 02:11:11,360
but we're talking about kendrick lamar
and I was like,

3038
02:11:11,361 --> 02:11:12,080
yeah,
he's sponsored by.

3039
02:11:12,080 --> 02:11:14,570
I was trying to say something positive
about reebok.

3040
02:11:14,730 --> 02:11:17,330
Mike lec sponsored by reebok because
reebok classics,

3041
02:11:17,810 --> 02:11:20,030
he just stops.
Everything was who'd though fuck is

3042
02:11:20,031 --> 02:11:21,670
wearing reebok's these days.
I was,

3043
02:11:22,060 --> 02:11:24,210
I was dying dude.
He killed him.

3044
02:11:25,220 --> 02:11:28,220
So the hairiest smart dude.
He's a very smart dude.

3045
02:11:28,250 --> 02:11:31,010
He's been trying to get me into soccer.
We tried so hard.

3046
02:11:31,460 --> 02:11:33,380
You gotta wait,
you gotta wait for fifa.

3047
02:11:33,400 --> 02:11:35,450
I mean for the world cup to really get
to.

3048
02:11:35,840 --> 02:11:37,460
We tried a few times,
man.

3049
02:11:37,461 --> 02:11:39,110
He sits me down.
It's pretty close.

3050
02:11:39,230 --> 02:11:40,220
Yeah,
it's pretty close.

3051
02:11:40,250 --> 02:11:44,570
It's still going on to catch the wave
one when we were thinking about doing

3052
02:11:44,571 --> 02:11:47,150
jamie is we're going to do like a fight
companion,

3053
02:11:47,630 --> 02:11:50,480
but uh,
a game companion and have ian and me

3054
02:11:50,810 --> 02:11:53,780
come down here.
But I'm going to be for you right now.

3055
02:11:53,781 --> 02:11:57,010
I'm going to be so high.
I'm barely going to be able to talk to

3056
02:11:57,030 --> 02:12:00,920
me to watch soccer and really appreciate
it and it's letting you know I'm a fan,

3057
02:12:00,921 --> 02:12:04,620
but it is a slow sport son for
companion.

3058
02:12:04,660 --> 02:12:07,100
Be tom,
be sitting up here with these jumbo

3059
02:12:07,150 --> 02:12:08,640
sprays,
the breast ca.

3060
02:12:09,160 --> 02:12:13,070
What is that exactly?
Just doing some weird shit.

3061
02:12:13,460 --> 02:12:18,460
It's the end of the world.
I took 10 of these accidentally.

3062
02:12:19,280 --> 02:12:21,440
Not accidentally.
I did it on purpose.

3063
02:12:21,800 --> 02:12:24,360
Thousand milligrams.
thc worries.

3064
02:12:24,650 --> 02:12:25,483
No worries.

3065
02:12:28,460 --> 02:12:32,720
You can go d spray.
It's legit.

3066
02:12:33,060 --> 02:12:35,000
Some gives you shit.
Minty breath and

3067
02:12:36,690 --> 02:12:39,050
jump pluto right there.
You'd need that for a second.

3068
02:12:39,051 --> 02:12:41,200
Slightly aBove pluto.
It's not a bad idea.

3069
02:12:41,201 --> 02:12:42,034
Yeah,
you need it.

3070
02:12:42,050 --> 02:12:44,280
You can't really just go out and
natural.

3071
02:12:44,450 --> 02:12:45,710
You can't.
You know,

3072
02:12:45,711 --> 02:12:48,110
you start freaking out.
Even I would do that for soccer

3073
02:12:48,111 --> 02:12:48,944
companion.
You.

3074
02:12:49,250 --> 02:12:52,250
Yeah.
That's a long companion and there's

3075
02:12:52,251 --> 02:12:53,750
like,
there's not a lot of excitement.

3076
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:55,460
You liked the edibles to go to sleep,
right?

3077
02:12:55,520 --> 02:12:56,390
Yeah.
Yeah.

3078
02:12:56,440 --> 02:12:57,470
A lot of people like,
well,

3079
02:12:57,471 --> 02:13:00,050
you know what?
Not edibles in the vapor pen asleep.

3080
02:13:00,230 --> 02:13:01,540
Oh really?
Edibles were giving me a ha.

3081
02:13:01,580 --> 02:13:04,190
Like I almost felt like a groggy in the
morning.

3082
02:13:04,400 --> 02:13:05,233
Really?
Yeah.

3083
02:13:05,720 --> 02:13:08,240
Maybe Just went too deep with what?
Milligram?

3084
02:13:08,241 --> 02:13:09,100
Edibles,
retaken.

3085
02:13:09,530 --> 02:13:11,540
I don't know.
Not the joey diaz shit.

3086
02:13:11,580 --> 02:13:13,430
Nobody.
Just literally just one hit from the

3087
02:13:13,431 --> 02:13:17,090
vapor and I'll sleep like a baby.
I cannot shut my mind off.

3088
02:13:17,240 --> 02:13:20,930
Joey diaz style once jamie doesn't get
affected by them.

3089
02:13:21,620 --> 02:13:24,650
Jamie,
he's got super powers,

3090
02:13:24,960 --> 02:13:29,960
get some super resistant,
have terrible superpowers.

3091
02:13:30,340 --> 02:13:32,070
Edibles,
and this is not

3092
02:13:32,070 --> 02:13:35,310
uncommon because Mike Schmidt,
who's my guest yesterday apparently has

3093
02:13:35,311 --> 02:13:37,590
the same issue.
He doesn't edibles,

3094
02:13:37,591 --> 02:13:41,010
do not affect him and mike smokes a lot
of weed so maybe that has something to

3095
02:13:41,011 --> 02:13:44,120
do with it,
but jamie does not get hot.

3096
02:13:44,280 --> 02:13:49,080
But you tried tums.
Someone told you three times and then

3097
02:13:49,081 --> 02:13:52,620
gave it like a half hour to try to set
in and then try to 150 milligram cookie.

3098
02:13:52,621 --> 02:13:54,690
where'd you get the idea of toms on
twitter?

3099
02:13:54,750 --> 02:13:57,570
I've never heard it.
I've asked lots of people at different,

3100
02:13:58,020 --> 02:13:59,520
different potheads,
different nutrition.

3101
02:13:59,521 --> 02:14:01,590
I think I've even asked rhonda patrick
when she came in one time,

3102
02:14:01,591 --> 02:14:05,280
if she had any idea.
We had five minutes to kill.

3103
02:14:06,270 --> 02:14:07,890
I figured out she was like,
what?

3104
02:14:07,940 --> 02:14:09,210
I know I shut.
She might've just said,

3105
02:14:09,211 --> 02:14:10,920
I have no idea.
I don't remember what her answer was,

3106
02:14:10,921 --> 02:14:13,200
but I've never heard the tums acid thing
with,

3107
02:14:13,610 --> 02:14:16,710
uh,
the 11 hydroxy metabolite.

3108
02:14:16,770 --> 02:14:18,480
Yes.
It might have a thing.

3109
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:21,810
That's my dad who's been eating it for a
long time since the sixties,

3110
02:14:21,811 --> 02:14:26,040
seventies and debbie and uh,
it's been going deep.

3111
02:14:26,130 --> 02:14:30,110
He said jeanette,
to the administration he's got.

3112
02:14:31,460 --> 02:14:32,510
He's a hippie guy.
Yeah.

3113
02:14:32,850 --> 02:14:35,790
But like his sister,
it'd be my aunt also doesn't have any

3114
02:14:35,820 --> 02:14:37,800
reaction to it.
So what a shitty sound.

3115
02:14:37,830 --> 02:14:41,790
The genetic thing could be some weird
dna switch that's not honoring.

3116
02:14:43,020 --> 02:14:45,600
My mom and my stepdad are in boulder
right now and uh,

3117
02:14:45,720 --> 02:14:46,500
you know,
they're retired.

3118
02:14:46,500 --> 02:14:49,500
They're doing the world tour that go on
everywhere.

3119
02:14:49,920 --> 02:14:51,770
They live in Mexico and they,
uh,

3120
02:14:51,771 --> 02:14:53,080
they travel all over the place.
They're,

3121
02:14:53,081 --> 02:14:55,170
they're living a beautiful life.
It's retirement.

3122
02:14:55,171 --> 02:14:56,280
I love it.
Anyway,

3123
02:14:56,480 --> 02:14:57,240
uh,
my,

3124
02:14:57,240 --> 02:15:00,600
they made my mom wait in the car because
my mom didn't have her license on her.

3125
02:15:00,900 --> 02:15:04,050
She went to a pot store,
they went to a pot store together in

3126
02:15:04,051 --> 02:15:04,630
Mexico.

3127
02:15:04,630 --> 02:15:09,480
No bolder and bolder and my dad went In
with my mom and my mom had to wait in

3128
02:15:09,481 --> 02:15:10,520
the car.
They go pitch,

3129
02:15:10,530 --> 02:15:13,500
you got to get out of here.
Really don't have your id.

3130
02:15:14,110 --> 02:15:16,740
They're so they're so even though it's
legal,

3131
02:15:17,100 --> 02:15:21,000
she's in her fucking sixties.
and they're like,

3132
02:15:21,240 --> 02:15:22,230
yeah,
no,

3133
02:15:22,231 --> 02:15:25,520
we don't trust you got to running a
tight ship and you never know crazy.

3134
02:15:25,521 --> 02:15:27,780
Like you don't have you,
you don't have your id.

3135
02:15:28,170 --> 02:15:32,850
So you got to wait in the car ma'am.
She's a grandma.

3136
02:15:33,240 --> 02:15:34,500
That is weird.
At 60.

3137
02:15:34,530 --> 02:15:38,820
I mean obviously she's over 21,
but I've seen good tonight at like a

3138
02:15:38,821 --> 02:15:39,710
liquor store.
I get that.

3139
02:15:39,730 --> 02:15:42,130
It's so ridiculous.
It's so fun.

3140
02:15:42,140 --> 02:15:43,020
Yeah.
I mean,

3141
02:15:43,021 --> 02:15:45,540
unless you have some crazy disease that
makes your grandma,

3142
02:15:45,960 --> 02:15:49,500
but even then if you do,
you should let them have their pot and

3143
02:15:49,501 --> 02:15:49,860
their booze.

3144
02:15:49,860 --> 02:15:52,680
Anyone can they get shut down though?
Like someone came was like,

3145
02:15:52,681 --> 02:15:54,190
let me see everyone's ids.
Boy,

3146
02:15:54,200 --> 02:15:55,230
I guess.
I mean,

3147
02:15:55,231 --> 02:15:57,750
I guess you could,
but you'd have to prove that they

3148
02:15:57,751 --> 02:16:01,260
weren't the right age.
You would have to like just be selling

3149
02:16:01,261 --> 02:16:04,080
someone under age.
All my mom would have to do is go to a

3150
02:16:04,081 --> 02:16:05,430
hotel room and go,
hey,

3151
02:16:05,431 --> 02:16:08,370
fucko some 69 years old also.
No.

3152
02:16:08,380 --> 02:16:09,640
Cops can be like,
ma'am,

3153
02:16:09,650 --> 02:16:11,040
are you sure?
Yeah.

3154
02:16:11,041 --> 02:16:13,210
They're going to look at 21.
Yeah,

3155
02:16:13,230 --> 02:16:14,230
she's going to go,
whoa.

3156
02:16:14,231 --> 02:16:16,410
I didn't know.
Have you been in some of those weed

3157
02:16:16,411 --> 02:16:18,240
shops in denver?
It's like the ipad store.

3158
02:16:18,300 --> 02:16:19,740
It's awesome.
It's ridiculous.

3159
02:16:20,020 --> 02:16:23,500
I'm a big fan of legalization obviously.
Yeah,

3160
02:16:23,670 --> 02:16:27,030
obviously I'm Montana where I was just
at.

3161
02:16:27,031 --> 02:16:32,031
Apparently they just in august of new
draconian measure kicks in and they're

3162
02:16:33,491 --> 02:16:37,330
trying to put the kabash on those
fucking ranchers and cowboys out there.

3163
02:16:37,330 --> 02:16:39,250
They're trying to put the kibosh on the,
uh,

3164
02:16:39,850 --> 02:16:41,440
the uh,
the pot movement out there.

3165
02:16:41,441 --> 02:16:45,580
And what they've done is they've put
like some heavy restrictions on the

3166
02:16:45,581 --> 02:16:50,581
amount of people that doctors can
prescribe marijuana to the amount of

3167
02:16:51,370 --> 02:16:56,370
people that care givers can prescribe it
to or dispense it to.

3168
02:16:56,680 --> 02:16:58,000
Like if you're a caregiver,
you can't.

3169
02:16:58,001 --> 02:17:01,390
Just like in a perfect example,
I have a license,

3170
02:17:01,420 --> 02:17:05,740
I go to a store that might serve fucking
a thousand people who knows it might

3171
02:17:05,741 --> 02:17:08,350
serve more than a thousand.
You go in there and there's just tons of

3172
02:17:08,351 --> 02:17:11,350
people all over the place.
Everybody has prescriptions and it

3173
02:17:11,351 --> 02:17:15,310
doesn't matter.
But in Montana they're making it pretty

3174
02:17:15,311 --> 02:17:17,670
difficult to have a legit reason.
Yeah,

3175
02:17:17,680 --> 02:17:20,530
well we're staying.
We were staying at this hotel called the

3176
02:17:20,531 --> 02:17:24,010
element in bozeman and right across the
street was this pot shop.

3177
02:17:24,490 --> 02:17:25,030
And I was looking.

3178
02:17:25,030 --> 02:17:27,040
I was like,
perfect right there.

3179
02:17:27,430 --> 02:17:28,290
And then I'm like,
ooh,

3180
02:17:28,300 --> 02:17:29,740
I wonder what kind of restrictions they
have.

3181
02:17:29,920 --> 02:17:31,840
So then I googled it and like,
oh boy,

3182
02:17:31,841 --> 02:17:36,841
it's about to come down on them.
But the thing with Montana didn't denver

3183
02:17:36,971 --> 02:17:39,870
set the blueprint like we're getting
rebates,

3184
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,400
tax rebates.
Denver's like we have too much moneY.

3185
02:17:42,401 --> 02:17:44,560
We cannot store it.
Just give it to the people.

3186
02:17:44,740 --> 02:17:46,900
These ranchers,
they don't even read in the newspaper.

3187
02:17:46,901 --> 02:17:49,390
They get smoke signals.
They're barely paying attention to

3188
02:17:49,391 --> 02:17:50,830
what's going on in the rest of the free
world.

3189
02:17:51,490 --> 02:17:52,990
I don't know who's doing it.
I don't know whose.

3190
02:17:53,430 --> 02:17:58,120
This is just a lot of people that have
this idea that pot smokers are dumb and

3191
02:17:58,121 --> 02:18:01,210
lazy and a problem and they don't
understand.

3192
02:18:01,480 --> 02:18:05,800
There's a lot of pot smokers like you
are like me that work hard as fuck and

3193
02:18:05,801 --> 02:18:09,460
are just adults and we want to be able
to do whatever the fuck we want to go to

3194
02:18:09,461 --> 02:18:11,200
venice beach because that could help you
out.

3195
02:18:11,220 --> 02:18:13,660
Help you.
One of those doctors.

3196
02:18:13,661 --> 02:18:16,800
I went in there to talk on those doctors
like this is so fucking shading.

3197
02:18:16,810 --> 02:18:19,690
Everyone in here is illusory.
Fitzsimmons Was talking to me about the

3198
02:18:19,691 --> 02:18:22,240
last time I was in denver.
It's like there's a few too many kids

3199
02:18:22,241 --> 02:18:26,080
playing hacky sack on the street.
They have a point.

3200
02:18:26,800 --> 02:18:28,410
We can't generalize everybody.
Well,

3201
02:18:28,411 --> 02:18:33,130
when you get a place like denver,
the problem is it becomes a magnet to

3202
02:18:33,131 --> 02:18:35,860
people that are attracted by
legalization.

3203
02:18:35,861 --> 02:18:38,860
A lot of those people are,
they're listless or drifters.

3204
02:18:38,980 --> 02:18:41,540
Sure.
Or they're people that are there.

3205
02:18:42,190 --> 02:18:44,170
This is going to be the place where I
could be me,

3206
02:18:44,171 --> 02:18:46,990
man.
Whereas if it was legal everywhere,

3207
02:18:47,440 --> 02:18:49,880
they would stay where they are.
Yeah.

3208
02:18:49,930 --> 02:18:52,810
They wouldn't have to go somewhere to
get pot.

3209
02:18:53,050 --> 02:18:58,050
So if you feel like you should keep the
natural ecosystem of losers in all their

3210
02:18:58,151 --> 02:19:00,310
natural environments,
but when you have one place and it's the

3211
02:19:00,311 --> 02:19:03,800
only place where they can get pot and
bitches are all over denver and venice,

3212
02:19:04,090 --> 02:19:09,090
there was a way you could give people an
understanding of what motivation and

3213
02:19:09,941 --> 02:19:11,890
discipline can reward you with.

3214
02:19:12,400 --> 02:19:13,690
Like I reallY did.
What do you mean?

3215
02:19:13,740 --> 02:19:16,030
Understanding you don't think social
media,

3216
02:19:16,031 --> 02:19:19,270
instagram and seeing you commentate and
stuff like that.

3217
02:19:19,390 --> 02:19:21,130
Does that for people?
Um,

3218
02:19:21,370 --> 02:19:24,160
maybe.
But I mean some people that are just

3219
02:19:24,161 --> 02:19:25,660
like say,
let's put it this way.

3220
02:19:25,960 --> 02:19:28,040
Say if you had a kid,
obviously you do have a kid,

3221
02:19:28,041 --> 02:19:32,410
but say if you had like a 20 year old
and he's just a fucking doper where a

3222
02:19:32,500 --> 02:19:34,700
wakened bakes and doesn't get anything
done.

3223
02:19:34,701 --> 02:19:38,540
It's just always like hanging out with
his friends and playing video games and

3224
02:19:38,541 --> 02:19:43,541
he's just a fucking loser.
I wish there was a way you could show

3225
02:19:44,361 --> 02:19:47,270
someone like that,
like I know that you're getting some

3226
02:19:47,271 --> 02:19:50,520
comfort and satisfaction.
I just laying around doing nothing,

3227
02:19:50,570 --> 02:19:51,590
eating,
getting fat,

3228
02:19:51,860 --> 02:19:55,310
but your life would feel better and
richer.

3229
02:19:55,400 --> 02:19:57,680
If you had a goal,
you chase that goal,

3230
02:19:57,681 --> 02:20:00,770
you accomplish some things and you would
get this boost of confidence.

3231
02:20:00,770 --> 02:20:03,790
You'd get tHis boost of self esteem like
whatever it is that you're going to do,

3232
02:20:03,800 --> 02:20:05,240
and maybe you're in a drawing comic
books.

3233
02:20:05,241 --> 02:20:09,440
Maybe you're into making fucking pottery
or sculptures or who,

3234
02:20:09,740 --> 02:20:11,780
but fine,
whatever the fuck that is,

3235
02:20:11,990 --> 02:20:15,800
and pursue that instead of doing nothing
like the people that are doing nothing.

3236
02:20:16,190 --> 02:20:18,380
Those are the real pen.
Look,

3237
02:20:18,560 --> 02:20:21,170
doing something might be as simple as
that.

3238
02:20:21,171 --> 02:20:26,150
Alex honnold guy climbs rocks,
but he's world class rock climber.

3239
02:20:26,180 --> 02:20:30,470
It's something but it's also a goal of
his and he's also the best at it.

3240
02:20:30,530 --> 02:20:32,120
Yes,
but those.

3241
02:20:32,180 --> 02:20:34,190
Those people who smoked pot all day and
do those.

3242
02:20:34,220 --> 02:20:36,020
Also,
the guys who hate on joe rogan for being

3243
02:20:36,021 --> 02:20:37,000
in shape,
you know what I'm saying,

3244
02:20:37,001 --> 02:20:40,130
or being disciplined or get on kevin
harts and scram and hate on,

3245
02:20:40,160 --> 02:20:41,240
you know what I'm saying?
Because they don't,

3246
02:20:41,600 --> 02:20:44,600
it's their own insecurities.
I see what you're saying.

3247
02:20:45,230 --> 02:20:47,570
But I,
I would assume they would get motivated

3248
02:20:47,571 --> 02:20:51,170
by seeing other people do something with
their lives.

3249
02:20:51,171 --> 02:20:52,610
Like that should be motivating.
Not.

3250
02:20:53,040 --> 02:20:55,190
Yeah,
but courage you up if you grew up with

3251
02:20:55,191 --> 02:20:58,240
losers and you're around a bunch of
people with shitty attitudes,

3252
02:20:58,241 --> 02:21:01,130
especially if it's in your household.
I was very lucky that,

3253
02:21:01,131 --> 02:21:04,430
uh,
both my mom and my stepdad there.

3254
02:21:04,460 --> 02:21:05,061
No,
they're not.

3255
02:21:05,061 --> 02:21:08,480
They're the least hater people I've ever
met my life.

3256
02:21:08,540 --> 02:21:12,230
They're just not haters in any way.
Like if someone's doing well,

3257
02:21:12,320 --> 02:21:13,220
there was like,
wow,

3258
02:21:13,221 --> 02:21:14,300
look at this guy.
Or like,

3259
02:21:14,301 --> 02:21:15,270
wow,
look at her.

3260
02:21:15,271 --> 02:21:16,250
Or wow,
look at him.

3261
02:21:16,370 --> 02:21:21,050
There was never any hate in my house in
terms of other people's success.

3262
02:21:21,051 --> 02:21:23,540
But if you grow up with a dad and your
dad's like,

3263
02:21:23,570 --> 02:21:26,440
eh,
these fucking all these rich asshole

3264
02:21:26,780 --> 02:21:28,730
fucking pussy,
he thinks she's a bad ass.

3265
02:21:28,731 --> 02:21:29,690
And tHis bucket,
you know,

3266
02:21:29,691 --> 02:21:33,110
there's people that look at other
people's success and instead of saying,

3267
02:21:33,111 --> 02:21:33,621
wow,
look,

3268
02:21:33,621 --> 02:21:37,010
I did a lot of work,
like the way I'm a successful person,

3269
02:21:37,220 --> 02:21:39,740
but the way I look at Kevin Hart,
he exhausts me,

3270
02:21:40,160 --> 02:21:41,270
you know,
or the rock.

3271
02:21:41,300 --> 02:21:43,640
Those guys have exhausted me.
I'm like jesus christ,

3272
02:21:43,641 --> 02:21:46,730
like I feel lazy next to those guys.
Like they do so much.

3273
02:21:46,731 --> 02:21:51,731
Like those guys are so overbearingly
ambitious,

3274
02:21:51,950 --> 02:21:54,500
you know.
But some people they see that and they

3275
02:21:54,501 --> 02:21:57,590
compare themselves and they don't like
it so they could start getting really

3276
02:21:57,591 --> 02:22:01,730
shitty and it's like a natural feeling
to try to chip away at that person.

3277
02:22:01,940 --> 02:22:03,450
Folk the little Kevin Horn.
Oh,

3278
02:22:03,460 --> 02:22:06,560
fucking smack.
I mean this month mother fucking funny.

3279
02:22:06,800 --> 02:22:09,920
and you see like the mean nasty shit
that people say to them.

3280
02:22:10,340 --> 02:22:11,150
Like,
um,

3281
02:22:11,150 --> 02:22:15,830
he went back and forth with some woman
on instagram was saying that his

3282
02:22:15,860 --> 02:22:18,110
girlfriend is only with him for his
money.

3283
02:22:18,160 --> 02:22:20,960
It was hilarious.
Like Just,

3284
02:22:21,620 --> 02:22:24,890
it's amazing that he decided to engage,
but instead is what he was like,

3285
02:22:24,960 --> 02:22:26,640
just got done running and it's doing all
that run.

3286
02:22:26,670 --> 02:22:27,960
I just bought his shoes by the way.

3287
02:22:28,580 --> 02:22:30,030
He has his own shoes,
nike shoes.

3288
02:22:30,031 --> 02:22:31,330
I'm like,
I got to support that.

3289
02:22:31,680 --> 02:22:33,520
I need a new trainer.
So I bought them jesus.

3290
02:22:33,570 --> 02:22:34,410
But uh,
yeah.

3291
02:22:34,411 --> 02:22:35,940
So he's not even pull up a picture of
those.

3292
02:22:35,941 --> 02:22:37,600
You said I'm a bachelor and jamie got
all excited.

3293
02:22:37,910 --> 02:22:41,820
Then
they have like his motivational quotes

3294
02:22:41,821 --> 02:22:42,810
on them.
I was like,

3295
02:22:42,811 --> 02:22:46,140
I have to support this guy doing this
fucking thing.

3296
02:22:46,470 --> 02:22:47,730
But uh,
yeah,

3297
02:22:47,731 --> 02:22:50,490
he started out his arm there and he's
like the only reason because it was a

3298
02:22:50,491 --> 02:22:52,590
picture of his fiance or something like
that,

3299
02:22:52,780 --> 02:22:55,530
like going reason why she's with you
because you're famous and [inaudible]

3300
02:22:55,540 --> 02:22:59,160
your money.
Look at that shelf Is wealth women.

3301
02:22:59,161 --> 02:23:00,240
That sign is saying,
yeah.

3302
02:23:00,270 --> 02:23:03,760
And his dog aspire work,
hustle,

3303
02:23:03,761 --> 02:23:07,180
hustle hard.
Oliver shoes see my ass on this kind of

3304
02:23:07,190 --> 02:23:10,460
stone work in those things.
They are Kevin Hart shoes like the,

3305
02:23:10,560 --> 02:23:12,720
it says hustle hart on the tongue.

3306
02:23:12,990 --> 02:23:14,910
That's hilarious.
Inside it says Kevin Hart.

3307
02:23:15,250 --> 02:23:17,780
That's hilarious.
How can you not appreciate that?

3308
02:23:17,840 --> 02:23:20,580
I appreciate what he's doing.
I mean all over the fucking choose.

3309
02:23:20,670 --> 02:23:22,680
I mean look,
if anybody gets those and it makes them

3310
02:23:22,681 --> 02:23:26,910
work a little bit harder and achieve
more success because of that.

3311
02:23:27,210 --> 02:23:28,320
Fuck yeah.
Good for them.

3312
02:23:28,410 --> 02:23:29,430
Yeah.
I Just poured them.

3313
02:23:29,720 --> 02:23:31,990
Let jews doing box jumps and shit.
Look at them.

3314
02:23:32,010 --> 02:23:34,170
There is this huge movement,
man.

3315
02:23:34,171 --> 02:23:36,840
Any town He goes into,
he does all these five ks and decades

3316
02:23:36,841 --> 02:23:37,920
and all that shit.
It's pretty cool.

3317
02:23:37,950 --> 02:23:39,090
He's a smart dude,
man.

3318
02:23:39,120 --> 02:23:40,560
He's smart.
He's motivated,

3319
02:23:40,561 --> 02:23:43,860
he's positive.
You got to have a talk with a mutual

3320
02:23:43,861 --> 02:23:48,210
friend of ours where we were talking
about work and I said it's all relative

3321
02:23:48,211 --> 02:23:50,640
because we look at you look at a used
you.

3322
02:23:50,850 --> 02:23:53,580
I used a,
a bunch of guys who were in the same

3323
02:23:53,581 --> 02:23:57,390
field and it's like you look at the
amount of work they're doing compared to

3324
02:23:57,391 --> 02:24:01,080
what you're doing and it's just you work
man.

3325
02:24:01,200 --> 02:24:05,300
Like I think our definition of work is
completely different because I might

3326
02:24:05,600 --> 02:24:07,290
look at joe rogan and say,
right,

3327
02:24:07,291 --> 02:24:09,500
he sold out the theater.
He's doing this ufc thing,

3328
02:24:09,540 --> 02:24:13,440
but you didn't start there like it's
overwhelming if you look at the huge

3329
02:24:13,441 --> 02:24:17,280
picture of the body of work of a guy
who's successful,

3330
02:24:17,430 --> 02:24:19,590
but he started just like you did
somewhere,

3331
02:24:19,591 --> 02:24:21,690
man.
But people see that and they just get

3332
02:24:21,691 --> 02:24:24,150
shut down because too Much of a hill to
climb the.

3333
02:24:24,151 --> 02:24:25,950
Yeah.
They look at it in terms of like,

3334
02:24:25,951 --> 02:24:28,920
I will never sell out 50,000 people in
philadelphia.

3335
02:24:28,921 --> 02:24:32,090
Like Kevin Hart did so fuck this.
Kevin didn't start there.

3336
02:24:32,091 --> 02:24:34,000
No.
Kevin started just like you did or

3337
02:24:34,110 --> 02:24:35,320
didn't have shit.
Yup.

3338
02:24:35,790 --> 02:24:40,790
He is just a guy that is just on fire
with his energy and his just.

3339
02:24:41,220 --> 02:24:45,330
His power is just,
he's just got a lot of passion and

3340
02:24:45,331 --> 02:24:46,070
drive.

3341
02:24:46,070 --> 02:24:48,090
It just goes.
And he also,

3342
02:24:48,420 --> 02:24:51,060
he reiterated that work ethic,
reiterated all the time.

3343
02:24:51,061 --> 02:24:52,290
I work hard,
you know what I mean?

3344
02:24:52,300 --> 02:24:54,160
You go to his twitter account that says
like,

3345
02:24:54,480 --> 02:24:58,220
my name's Kevin Hart and I work hard.
Like that's like hashtag shit.

3346
02:24:58,510 --> 02:24:59,820
Big,
big part of who he is.

3347
02:24:59,880 --> 02:25:01,230
So I think,
you know,

3348
02:25:01,231 --> 02:25:03,570
some people just,
they don't understand that,

3349
02:25:03,571 --> 02:25:07,890
that if you just keep doing that,
it does pay off and so they just get

3350
02:25:07,891 --> 02:25:11,130
overwhelMed and again they start hating,
hating.

3351
02:25:11,280 --> 02:25:13,020
Yeah.
And liKe when I was listening to the joe

3352
02:25:13,050 --> 02:25:15,540
schilling podcasts use time,
but he just came off that loss.

3353
02:25:15,590 --> 02:25:16,810
I meant to reach.
I right.

3354
02:25:16,880 --> 02:25:18,750
I,
I text you and I meant to call him,

3355
02:25:19,260 --> 02:25:20,650
but he was focused on.
But he.

3356
02:25:20,680 --> 02:25:22,440
And he's given that power.
It's like,

3357
02:25:22,441 --> 02:25:23,830
joe,
you're doing shit,

3358
02:25:23,831 --> 02:25:24,370
man.

3359
02:25:24,370 --> 02:25:27,910
Anyone who's doing successful stuff,
even though you lost still on the

3360
02:25:27,911 --> 02:25:31,060
baddest man on the planet,
the woodville heckers and the haters,

3361
02:25:32,520 --> 02:25:34,720
that stuff,
it comes with the territory man.

3362
02:25:34,870 --> 02:25:36,820
If you weren't doing shit,
they're not going to hate on you.

3363
02:25:36,960 --> 02:25:39,700
So,
so given them power in acknowledging

3364
02:25:39,701 --> 02:25:41,440
that it's Just a bad,
like you're going to deal with that

3365
02:25:41,441 --> 02:25:44,410
whether you won or lost man,
he comes with the territory.

3366
02:25:44,950 --> 02:25:46,840
YeaH.
It's just one of those things mean he's

3367
02:25:46,841 --> 02:25:49,300
a.
Especially because he's as powerful

3368
02:25:49,301 --> 02:25:52,360
guys,
wild ass kick boxer who wound up losing.

3369
02:25:52,361 --> 02:25:55,810
So it's an opportunity for the losers to
feel like they're more of a winter than

3370
02:25:55,811 --> 02:25:58,660
him because they didn't get knocked out.
Yeah.

3371
02:25:58,900 --> 02:26:00,280
Yeah.
I meant to reach out to and I forget.

3372
02:26:01,720 --> 02:26:03,580
He's fine.
He took it better,

3373
02:26:03,640 --> 02:26:08,260
way better than he did the last fight,
the last fight.

3374
02:26:08,261 --> 02:26:10,810
He lost the same dude was a lot tougher
for him.

3375
02:26:10,960 --> 02:26:11,920
Yeah.
Yeah.

3376
02:26:12,320 --> 02:26:13,920
He,
he gave a great point though,

3377
02:26:13,930 --> 02:26:15,590
how you're saying like that's his
fighting style.

3378
02:26:15,970 --> 02:26:18,580
He likes to go out on a shield.
There's guys like that man.

3379
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,730
While he does man,
I mean that is how he fights every

3380
02:26:21,731 --> 02:26:23,710
single fight.
He fights like a wild man.

3381
02:26:23,840 --> 02:26:25,660
It's this shit.
You know,

3382
02:26:25,661 --> 02:26:28,240
he's a,
he's the reason why he's one of the best

3383
02:26:28,241 --> 02:26:30,820
in the world.
He's an exciting guy to watch.

3384
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:31,811
I mean,
if you,

3385
02:26:31,811 --> 02:26:35,860
if you're looking for a guy to be the
brand name or the,

3386
02:26:36,040 --> 02:26:38,380
you know,
the figurehead for your organization for

3387
02:26:38,800 --> 02:26:40,870
kickboxing,
you want an exciting guy.

3388
02:26:41,350 --> 02:26:42,550
That's your fucking guy,
man.

3389
02:26:42,610 --> 02:26:43,510
He's your guy.
Yeah,

3390
02:26:43,730 --> 02:26:44,560
he's,
he.

3391
02:26:44,560 --> 02:26:49,450
the thing about joe is like,
he's not allowed like flashy guy.

3392
02:26:49,690 --> 02:26:51,400
Like he's almost,
he's a quiet,

3393
02:26:51,580 --> 02:26:54,070
intRoverted type of dude.
You have a conversation with them,

3394
02:26:54,071 --> 02:26:54,820
you know what I'm saying?

3395
02:26:54,820 --> 02:26:55,200
Like,
you know,

3396
02:26:55,200 --> 02:26:56,120
a lot of ways.
Yeah,

3397
02:26:56,210 --> 02:26:58,930
he really is.
He's like a reserved Kevin Ross,

3398
02:26:59,050 --> 02:27:01,060
Kevin Ross,
another good example of a,

3399
02:27:01,061 --> 02:27:04,750
a great,
really example of a guy who would be a

3400
02:27:04,751 --> 02:27:05,800
great,
like,

3401
02:27:06,420 --> 02:27:09,630
you know,
I keep saying figurehead,

3402
02:27:09,640 --> 02:27:12,990
but like what would be spokesperson or
you know,

3403
02:27:12,991 --> 02:27:16,630
an example of a championship caliber
fighter that you would admire,

3404
02:27:16,770 --> 02:27:19,180
you know,
and kevin fights very technical.

3405
02:27:19,510 --> 02:27:22,780
He's a really interesting guy to watch a
really liked the way you fight.

3406
02:27:22,781 --> 02:27:25,420
So like the waY puts combinations
together like very,

3407
02:27:26,110 --> 02:27:26,950
very,
uh,

3408
02:27:27,070 --> 02:27:30,550
diverse attacks.
he mixes things up and twist things

3409
02:27:30,551 --> 02:27:33,700
around on you and varies.
He switches up to speed.

3410
02:27:33,701 --> 02:27:34,960
It was attack,
you know,

3411
02:27:35,930 --> 02:27:39,330
the thIng with that would have to happen
for bellatore,

3412
02:27:39,350 --> 02:27:41,780
but kickbox in general,
especially joe schilling,

3413
02:27:41,890 --> 02:27:45,290
they just need to tell a story.
So people are invested because his

3414
02:27:45,291 --> 02:27:47,410
story,
it's fucking cool and he's a good guy to

3415
02:27:47,411 --> 02:27:49,870
get to know,
but that story's just not getting out

3416
02:27:49,871 --> 02:27:51,400
there.
They also have to change the name

3417
02:27:52,550 --> 02:27:54,430
valador.
Get out of here with that.

3418
02:27:54,970 --> 02:27:57,640
It's not helping enough.
It's not tried it.

3419
02:27:57,670 --> 02:27:59,710
You tried it forever.
It's probably holding you back.

3420
02:27:59,890 --> 02:28:02,110
You don't think you think you don't
think they're in too deep?

3421
02:28:02,700 --> 02:28:05,170
No.
No.

3422
02:28:05,230 --> 02:28:08,050
What would you call it?
spike kickboxing.

3423
02:28:08,230 --> 02:28:11,160
Spike mma.
But then spike owns your cake.

3424
02:28:11,200 --> 02:28:12,660
spike owns it.
Tough shit.

3425
02:28:12,661 --> 02:28:14,560
It's by guns.
It already will know.

3426
02:28:14,770 --> 02:28:19,200
Build towards a separate item on spike,
but it's just.

3427
02:28:19,840 --> 02:28:22,070
It's just mma.
You're going

3428
02:28:22,070 --> 02:28:23,540
to have to do something like the ufc
does.

3429
02:28:23,541 --> 02:28:25,190
Right?
Like ultimate fighting championship.

3430
02:28:25,191 --> 02:28:26,570
Like nfl,
nba,

3431
02:28:26,600 --> 02:28:27,650
viacom,
mma.

3432
02:28:27,930 --> 02:28:28,763
no,
no.

3433
02:28:31,460 --> 02:28:34,340
I just think the name is too dumb.
It's tough.

3434
02:28:34,370 --> 02:28:36,110
It's a tough sell.
It's dumb.

3435
02:28:36,140 --> 02:28:38,480
Did you like strikeforce?
It's better.

3436
02:28:38,610 --> 02:28:41,690
What?
Stripe or it sounds ridiculous.

3437
02:28:43,730 --> 02:28:46,010
Strikeforce elites.
So like a jet.

3438
02:28:46,040 --> 02:28:50,120
It's silly as combo battalion.
Yeah.

3439
02:28:50,130 --> 02:28:53,390
That's a dumb name to your right here.
They all suck.

3440
02:28:53,560 --> 02:28:56,090
You have seized the best by far.
The best name.

3441
02:28:56,390 --> 02:28:58,490
Ultimate fighting championship.
Dream.

3442
02:28:58,580 --> 02:29:03,020
Pride with pride.
Pride was amazing organization,

3443
02:29:03,050 --> 02:29:07,070
but if you walk around with a fist that
says pride on it.

3444
02:29:07,100 --> 02:29:07,933
Oh,
these days

3445
02:29:09,470 --> 02:29:10,820
I used to have a pressure.
I'm like,

3446
02:29:10,840 --> 02:29:14,060
I can't wear that anymore.
I didn't know what it's not relevant

3447
02:29:14,061 --> 02:29:14,894
anymore.
Well,

3448
02:29:15,380 --> 02:29:19,140
I see people with pride shirts on.
I give them fist bumps because your

3449
02:29:19,440 --> 02:29:22,660
number may go down west hollywood with a
pride shirt on.

3450
02:29:22,880 --> 02:29:25,370
Pride never die in free.
Fucking.

3451
02:29:25,400 --> 02:29:28,700
You know what I love most about pride?
I watched it purely as a fan.

3452
02:29:29,090 --> 02:29:29,960
I never,
not,

3453
02:29:29,961 --> 02:29:33,050
not just most because they had some of
the greatest fights of all time,

3454
02:29:33,080 --> 02:29:35,960
but also because I got to enjoy it
purely as a fan.

3455
02:29:36,260 --> 02:29:39,100
Never called any of those fights.
Never was there live.

3456
02:29:39,101 --> 02:29:41,870
Was an invested really.
You just a super fan of it.

3457
02:29:41,900 --> 02:29:44,210
I just got to enjoy it.
Just enjoy it.

3458
02:29:44,330 --> 02:29:46,850
Pure and I think that's why we put on a
pedal stool.

3459
02:29:46,880 --> 02:29:49,790
You know what I'm saying?
Like it's like it's pride.

3460
02:29:50,420 --> 02:29:54,680
You weren't like breaking it down and
when it was coming up I was just a

3461
02:29:54,681 --> 02:29:55,900
fucking fan.
Yeah.

3462
02:29:55,910 --> 02:29:58,220
Had a cro cop show.
I was watching that shit.

3463
02:29:58,221 --> 02:30:01,190
Just like enjoying the.
Do you remember watching some of them

3464
02:30:01,191 --> 02:30:04,730
live where you'd have to get up at like
fucking 3:00 in the morning?

3465
02:30:04,760 --> 02:30:08,570
Fuck that.
Because they were from Japan,

3466
02:30:08,571 --> 02:30:12,290
so ridiculous.
And then I remember being at the one in

3467
02:30:12,291 --> 02:30:16,340
vegas the first time I ever came here
when favor coleman and I was just blood

3468
02:30:16,390 --> 02:30:20,720
the shitty suit on,
on a lazman and a shitty suit on shitty

3469
02:30:20,721 --> 02:30:23,270
haircut.
Just like memorize by everyone.

3470
02:30:23,540 --> 02:30:25,080
Mesmerize,
not memorized tHem.

3471
02:30:25,160 --> 02:30:27,470
Men.
I met saul,

3472
02:30:27,471 --> 02:30:30,800
phil baroni and I thought it was fucking
will smith.

3473
02:30:31,070 --> 02:30:33,100
right.
And he was a straight dick to me was.

3474
02:30:33,110 --> 02:30:34,390
He was,

3475
02:30:34,400 --> 02:30:36,470
cause my husband,
my buddy a clot and like,

3476
02:30:36,471 --> 02:30:41,060
oh let's get a picture of phil baroni.
The New York bad ass was just

3477
02:30:41,061 --> 02:30:42,220
ridiculous.
I'm all,

3478
02:30:42,230 --> 02:30:43,300
phil,
can I get a pic?

3479
02:30:43,550 --> 02:30:46,640
He turns around,
he is a juice to the gills,

3480
02:30:46,670 --> 02:30:48,680
like just fucking what?
He's like,

3481
02:30:48,710 --> 02:30:50,120
just call me a prick.
Like,

3482
02:30:50,760 --> 02:30:51,530
no,
no,

3483
02:30:51,530 --> 02:30:53,450
I'm so intimidating.
Like I said,

3484
02:30:53,451 --> 02:30:54,284
pick.
He was,

3485
02:30:54,320 --> 02:30:55,153
yeah,
let's do it.

3486
02:30:55,520 --> 02:30:57,290
Took the pictures and I'm looking at the
camera.

3487
02:30:57,440 --> 02:31:01,190
Just checking out some girl.
It's just like this shitty picture.

3488
02:31:02,720 --> 02:31:06,050
I watched that dave a fight the other
day when he knocked out dave,

3489
02:31:06,051 --> 02:31:07,100
my name.
Oh dude,

3490
02:31:07,190 --> 02:31:10,330
what a common nation.
He like,

3491
02:31:10,370 --> 02:31:13,550
pinned him up against the cage.
He was unconscious and just keeping them

3492
02:31:13,551 --> 02:31:17,990
up with punches and punches.
Just hit them with like four or five

3493
02:31:18,080 --> 02:31:20,070
ridiculously hard punches in

3494
02:31:20,070 --> 02:31:24,000
a row while he was out standing up.
Phil baroni,

3495
02:31:25,080 --> 02:31:29,160
remember when he knocked out of marzullo
of that bad ass russian dude who want to

3496
02:31:29,161 --> 02:31:30,930
be in like a hitman.
Oh yeah.

3497
02:31:31,970 --> 02:31:36,570
That guy just died from cancer in the
pokey.

3498
02:31:36,720 --> 02:31:38,120
In Russia.
No.

3499
02:31:38,940 --> 02:31:41,460
Yeah,
but there was some rumor that he was

3500
02:31:41,461 --> 02:31:46,461
some hitman that he had a turned to a
life of feeling like,

3501
02:31:46,471 --> 02:31:47,510
yeah,
if we russian guy,

3502
02:31:47,530 --> 02:31:49,320
we hear that story like remember fate or
his brother.

3503
02:31:49,321 --> 02:31:53,330
It was like the tattoo on his back and
grim reaper cause he kills people and

3504
02:31:53,331 --> 02:31:58,260
the grim reaper holding a baby the most
intense tattoo of all time.

3505
02:31:58,530 --> 02:32:02,970
That was the most intense tattoo.
A grim reaper holding a baby and he had

3506
02:32:02,971 --> 02:32:07,250
some russian mob shit that was tattooed
on his chest and shoulders.

3507
02:32:07,290 --> 02:32:09,050
Didn't have a tramp stamp.
Yeah.

3508
02:32:09,380 --> 02:32:13,240
That's.
Look at that terrible baby books off his

3509
02:32:13,760 --> 02:32:14,670
work ever.

3510
02:32:14,760 --> 02:32:18,510
That's all russian prison shit.
But he had some shit on his front

3511
02:32:18,511 --> 02:32:19,920
shoulders.
That guy's in jail now.

3512
02:32:20,400 --> 02:32:21,181
Yeah,
he's in prison,

3513
02:32:21,181 --> 02:32:21,990
righT?
Right.

3514
02:32:21,990 --> 02:32:23,010
Yeah.
He's in jail.

3515
02:32:23,070 --> 02:32:26,100
So those things on his end is.
See those.

3516
02:32:26,190 --> 02:32:30,120
He covered up the shit that was there to
make that.

3517
02:32:30,620 --> 02:32:33,150
Damion,
but they have those all marked up.

3518
02:32:33,180 --> 02:32:36,450
Those numbers,
those numbers that indicated in that

3519
02:32:36,451 --> 02:32:38,970
photo.
That's like indicating all the different

3520
02:32:38,971 --> 02:32:43,160
tattoos go above far to the left.
The third one right there.

3521
02:32:43,200 --> 02:32:47,610
Pat precede that shows that shows like
what he got tattooed.

3522
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:49,800
I guess it doesn't.
That just shows up.

3523
02:32:49,860 --> 02:32:54,390
He's got a horse on his chest and he's a
really terrible tattoos,

3524
02:32:54,990 --> 02:32:59,520
but he's a
dad bod for that photo shoot.

3525
02:32:59,610 --> 02:33:00,690
See?
That's what he used to have.

3526
02:33:00,990 --> 02:33:02,730
See those things,
those stars.

3527
02:33:03,150 --> 02:33:07,980
Apparently those things have something
to do with the russian mob or organized

3528
02:33:07,981 --> 02:33:08,850
crime or something.

3529
02:33:08,920 --> 02:33:11,970
So he had them covered over with those
designs.

3530
02:33:12,270 --> 02:33:16,050
So that's the original ones there and
now they're those weird.

3531
02:33:16,051 --> 02:33:19,140
Let's be some serious shit if you have
to cover him up where pride.

3532
02:33:19,141 --> 02:33:19,801
It was like,
yo man,

3533
02:33:19,801 --> 02:33:21,990
we got to cover these up.
I don't think pride wanted them to do

3534
02:33:21,991 --> 02:33:22,530
it.
I think,

3535
02:33:22,530 --> 02:33:25,080
you know,
he probably just reached a turning point

3536
02:33:25,081 --> 02:33:26,490
in his life.
He was like,

3537
02:33:26,491 --> 02:33:28,170
okay,
but you don't get out though.

3538
02:33:28,890 --> 02:33:29,940
Uh,
I don't know.

3539
02:33:29,970 --> 02:33:30,810
I mean,
he's in prison.

3540
02:33:30,811 --> 02:33:32,850
So what's he in prison for?
Do we know?

3541
02:33:33,150 --> 02:33:36,750
I believe it's rape,
but of course,

3542
02:33:39,070 --> 02:33:41,300
god,
yeah.

3543
02:33:42,440 --> 02:33:43,261
Yeah.
Who knows?

3544
02:33:43,261 --> 02:33:44,580
You hear about ryan,
jim hillman.

3545
02:33:44,790 --> 02:33:47,820
Fuck and horrible.
But great guy.

3546
02:33:47,821 --> 02:33:51,600
He was great guy.
Apparently got hit by a car,

3547
02:33:51,660 --> 02:33:54,330
got out to check the damage and whoever
hit him random over.

3548
02:33:54,870 --> 02:33:56,160
See,
I heard something else.

3549
02:33:56,190 --> 02:33:57,030
Maybe I'm off.

3550
02:33:57,420 --> 02:33:59,940
Do you know jay?
I heard he had an altercation inside,

3551
02:33:59,941 --> 02:34:01,240
like a bar.
Oh.

3552
02:34:01,380 --> 02:34:04,890
Then it continued outside and the dude
was in a monster truck,

3553
02:34:05,190 --> 02:34:07,080
like a big,
just a truck lifted.

3554
02:34:07,260 --> 02:34:10,860
And jim owned him where he was.
The guy who hit him was in his truck.

3555
02:34:11,070 --> 02:34:14,250
Then he backed up and ran over.
Ryan drove off.

3556
02:34:14,550 --> 02:34:16,410
Maybe that's true.
I heard,

3557
02:34:16,411 --> 02:34:17,244
uh,
you know,

3558
02:34:17,290 --> 02:34:20,320
right after it happened or read about it
online.

3559
02:34:20,620 --> 02:34:22,780
Uh,
someone I think I saw on twitter,

3560
02:34:23,020 --> 02:34:24,670
rip ryan gmo,
and I was like,

3561
02:34:24,671 --> 02:34:26,530
no,
no man,

3562
02:34:27,070 --> 02:34:28,870
I couldn't believe it.
I went no.

3563
02:34:29,230 --> 02:34:34,230
And then then I saw some reports and I
think they probably didn't have all the

3564
02:34:34,841 --> 02:34:36,790
data.
Hair goes.

3565
02:34:37,150 --> 02:34:39,490
Thirty four year old jim.
I was involved in a verbal altercation

3566
02:34:39,491 --> 02:34:42,370
with two suspects before it was hit by
the vehicle to men.

3567
02:34:42,371 --> 02:34:47,371
That truck identified as anthony get
shoal and Jordan Wagner immediately fled

3568
02:34:48,911 --> 02:34:52,810
the scene soon after,
but were eventually arrested less than a

3569
02:34:52,811 --> 02:34:55,300
week after the incident.
There subsequently charged with second

3570
02:34:55,301 --> 02:34:58,300
degree murder and accessory after the
fact to the murder respectably.

3571
02:35:00,640 --> 02:35:05,640
Want to just propose to her on the way
home from the movies truck began

3572
02:35:06,401 --> 02:35:09,640
tailgating them.
I think our storage combined make this

3573
02:35:09,641 --> 02:35:12,820
thing.
So we took a left to let them go by.

3574
02:35:13,670 --> 02:35:14,530
Now they're both.
Okay.

3575
02:35:14,531 --> 02:35:15,850
What's going on?
First?

3576
02:35:15,860 --> 02:35:18,160
Reading the parking lot.
No clue where we were at.

3577
02:35:18,400 --> 02:35:21,610
These guys pulled up real close behind
ryan almost if they're going to hit us,

3578
02:35:22,120 --> 02:35:23,680
both felt nervous.
Why?

3579
02:35:23,681 --> 02:35:26,410
And felt the need to do something
because we didn't want them following us

3580
02:35:26,411 --> 02:35:27,730
out of there.
I was kind of scary.

3581
02:35:28,570 --> 02:35:30,850
Something not right.
Wow.

3582
02:35:30,880 --> 02:35:32,610
To talk to.
They were not nice guys.

3583
02:35:32,611 --> 02:35:34,930
When I came to get back to philadelphia,
went back,

3584
02:35:34,960 --> 02:35:39,310
talked to them after the two men hit
gentleman sped off.

3585
02:35:39,820 --> 02:35:43,120
Fuck man.
Jesus christ.

3586
02:35:44,410 --> 02:35:45,370
Yeah.
You know what,

3587
02:35:45,371 --> 02:35:47,380
man?
People are fucking crazy.

3588
02:35:47,381 --> 02:35:49,030
You never know.
You never know.

3589
02:35:49,031 --> 02:35:53,260
You just for whatever reason,
you cut somebody off and they on math

3590
02:35:53,261 --> 02:35:57,420
and they just decided to run you over.
She holds no hatred towards the men that

3591
02:35:57,421 --> 02:35:59,920
killed jim.
Owen is merely trying to remain positive

3592
02:35:59,921 --> 02:36:02,320
through her moments of grief.
Good girl.

3593
02:36:02,710 --> 02:36:04,750
Good luck with.
Wow.

3594
02:36:04,751 --> 02:36:07,600
That's crazy.
What a shitty situation,

3595
02:36:07,601 --> 02:36:08,830
man.
Wow.

3596
02:36:09,610 --> 02:36:11,970
Boy,
that's heavy.

3597
02:36:14,060 --> 02:36:16,870
You know,
decisions that you make in this life and

3598
02:36:16,871 --> 02:36:21,490
that's a big one that people make is
fucking hostility behind the wheel.

3599
02:36:21,790 --> 02:36:24,820
But I see it all the time.
I was watching these guys real recently

3600
02:36:24,821 --> 02:36:26,350
just screaming and yelling at each other
in their car.

3601
02:36:26,351 --> 02:36:28,780
I'm like,
this could easily end up in death and

3602
02:36:28,870 --> 02:36:30,130
get the fuck out of here.
These,

3603
02:36:30,240 --> 02:36:32,580
these guys could easily get out and
shoot each other or me,

3604
02:36:32,630 --> 02:36:36,970
I just assumed they have guns,
so which might be a weird way to look at

3605
02:36:36,971 --> 02:36:37,990
it.
It's a safe way.

3606
02:36:38,210 --> 02:36:40,720
Like literally last night we were
driving through venice,

3607
02:36:40,721 --> 02:36:43,420
July 4th,
the light turned yellow,

3608
02:36:43,450 --> 02:36:44,320
you know,
it's busy.

3609
02:36:44,350 --> 02:36:48,100
So like I'm in the way of them going the
other way and this dude just like move

3610
02:36:48,101 --> 02:36:51,620
out the fucking idiot and the people in
the car you might go like,

3611
02:36:52,540 --> 02:36:53,630
like,
what do you want me to do?

3612
02:36:53,660 --> 02:36:55,800
You want me to yell back at him for
what?

3613
02:36:55,840 --> 02:36:57,610
I don't give a fuck.
He's like,

3614
02:36:57,611 --> 02:36:59,980
who cares?
Who cares man?

3615
02:37:00,520 --> 02:37:01,480
You never know.
I mean,

3616
02:37:01,510 --> 02:37:04,450
it's not hard to get a gun.
It's definitely not hard to get a gun

3617
02:37:04,451 --> 02:37:06,890
here in los angeles.
Plus if it's a little guy barking this,

3618
02:37:06,980 --> 02:37:08,200
you know,
there's a reason.

3619
02:37:08,201 --> 02:37:10,600
Why is that confidence?
Well usually they're just stupid,

3620
02:37:11,170 --> 02:37:16,170
but it's possible that he has a gun too.
But all the to things like what we're

3621
02:37:16,280 --> 02:37:17,960
talking about.
But the difference between,

3622
02:37:18,240 --> 02:37:20,810
you know,
being in a community where there's less

3623
02:37:20,811 --> 02:37:23,660
people and people value people versus
being in,

3624
02:37:23,940 --> 02:37:24,771
you know,
but then again,

3625
02:37:24,771 --> 02:37:28,490
jimmo lives up in edmonton.
That's not a crowded place in edmonton

3626
02:37:28,491 --> 02:37:31,790
is a city to big city is a pretty good
amount of people up there,

3627
02:37:31,791 --> 02:37:33,460
but it's not like los angeles.
Sure.

3628
02:37:33,800 --> 02:37:35,900
But you know how people,
a lot of people are drunk and they're

3629
02:37:35,901 --> 02:37:38,420
doing drugs and there's all sorts of
shit going on.

3630
02:37:38,421 --> 02:37:39,590
It's clouding your judgment.

3631
02:37:41,860 --> 02:37:44,270
It's just sad.
That's a bummer.

3632
02:37:44,390 --> 02:37:46,010
Yeah.
He was a good guy too.

3633
02:37:46,040 --> 02:37:47,060
Really good guy.
Very,

3634
02:37:47,061 --> 02:37:49,730
very friendly gun fighter to watch too.
Yeah.

3635
02:37:50,990 --> 02:37:53,800
I think burt watson was the one who
wrote rip.

3636
02:37:53,830 --> 02:37:56,240
Jimmo is looking at birth because I
follow bird on twitter.

3637
02:37:56,250 --> 02:37:58,170
Really?
What's doing.

3638
02:37:58,220 --> 02:38:01,850
Just to switch it up.
He's doing what he used to do with some

3639
02:38:01,851 --> 02:38:03,290
other organizations.
Oh,

3640
02:38:03,291 --> 02:38:05,420
is he still doing that?
Yeah.

3641
02:38:05,540 --> 02:38:08,060
Yeah.
That's a guy I miss.

3642
02:38:08,450 --> 02:38:09,360
I miss that dude,
bro.

3643
02:38:09,370 --> 02:38:10,490
Was the man.
Yeah.

3644
02:38:10,590 --> 02:38:12,980
Lay still is the man.
He's just the man somewhere else other

3645
02:38:12,981 --> 02:38:14,120
than the ufc.
True.

3646
02:38:14,121 --> 02:38:18,700
But you don't see him anymore.
Did do a stitch is back right?

3647
02:38:19,650 --> 02:38:21,350
I think so in the ufc,
right?

3648
02:38:21,760 --> 02:38:23,890
Am I going crazy?
I saw him at that belt or meeting them

3649
02:38:23,900 --> 02:38:26,090
at a great combo and he said he's back
in the ufc.

3650
02:38:26,810 --> 02:38:29,460
I thought I saw him.
That would be nice if he wanted like

3651
02:38:29,510 --> 02:38:31,850
show me fight.
That could have been bellatore ufc,

3652
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:35,420
but whatever reason he wasn't.
The eoc was ridiculous.

3653
02:38:35,750 --> 02:38:38,630
He criticized the reebok deal just like
we just did

3654
02:38:40,130 --> 02:38:41,150
and I'm out of the ufc.

3655
02:38:43,580 --> 02:38:46,550
What are you going to do?
What are you gonna do?

3656
02:38:46,610 --> 02:38:49,070
I don't have a stake in the game
anymore.

3657
02:38:49,130 --> 02:38:51,490
We're out of time here.
It's 4:30 already,

3658
02:38:51,520 --> 02:38:52,520
dan.
That's fast son.

3659
02:38:52,550 --> 02:38:54,570
We just through,
but we actually talked about the fights

3660
02:38:54,571 --> 02:38:55,281
though.
We did.

3661
02:38:55,281 --> 02:38:57,380
People don't think we're going to.
It started off.

3662
02:38:57,590 --> 02:38:59,360
We started off a little shaky.
Well,

3663
02:38:59,370 --> 02:39:02,660
you got me rattled before with the stuff
that you're telling me before we

3664
02:39:02,661 --> 02:39:03,580
started,
I started out.

3665
02:39:03,710 --> 02:39:08,710
I got dumped on simon and we ended.
We ended with gmo will rest in peace.

3666
02:39:11,631 --> 02:39:12,201
Ryan.
Jim.

3667
02:39:12,201 --> 02:39:13,350
Oh,
you were great man.

3668
02:39:17,340 --> 02:39:20,910
Life goes on as hard.
I was going to promote a live show.

3669
02:39:20,911 --> 02:39:22,590
You just can not do it.
Promote it.

3670
02:39:22,591 --> 02:39:25,200
When is it a fire in the kid?
Live in phoenix,

3671
02:39:25,201 --> 02:39:26,850
Arizona.
You're going to get brian calendar.

3672
02:39:26,851 --> 02:39:29,220
July 29th and 30th.
Brian might be there.

3673
02:39:29,340 --> 02:39:30,830
He's going to be there.
He'll be there.

3674
02:39:30,890 --> 02:39:33,600
He's going to be there.
Slap them that you guys do in phoenix

3675
02:39:33,601 --> 02:39:34,434
live.
Yeah.

3676
02:39:34,440 --> 02:39:34,890
La,
la,

3677
02:39:34,890 --> 02:39:35,700
whatever it is.
Yeah.

3678
02:39:35,700 --> 02:39:37,400
