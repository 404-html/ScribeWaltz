1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,400
Yes.
Wayne Fetterman.

2
00:00:02,401 --> 00:00:03,870
How are you sir?
I'm swell.

3
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:04,621
Thank you.
Thanks.

4
00:00:04,621 --> 00:00:05,454
Well,
swell.

5
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:06,303
Yeah,
first time anyone's ever said that real 

6
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,480
on this podcast when I asked him how you
doing swell either the first Guy Matt,

7
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:13,583
and what number podcasts is this?
Eight 800 and something 829 829 so 

8
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:23,550
you're the first guy to ever say swell.
What's the usual response?

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,070
It's just standard noises,
you know?

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,150
Great.
Awesome.

11
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:28,680
Ah,
Eh,

12
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:29,970
you know,
standard stuff.

13
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,740
The way people normally talk.
This is,

14
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:35,400
you're going to learn something about me
not standard swell.

15
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,130
Yeah,
it's definitely Janie.

16
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,870
Sketchy.
So,

17
00:00:39,871 --> 00:00:40,704
uh,
I am talking before this podcast about 

18
00:00:42,031 --> 00:00:43,860
someone stealing your twitter handle.
Man,

19
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,360
I inadvertently posted,
uh,

20
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,060
at Wayne Fetterman and I thought it was 
you because when you go to it,

21
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:52,560
it had that,
it looks like they had it.

22
00:00:52,561 --> 00:00:54,420
So how'd this guy steal it?
I don't know.

23
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,000
So he stole your password somehow.

24
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:56,880
Somehow.
That's,

25
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,180
that's the scariest part.
So how does twitter not respond to that?

26
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:01,014
And I don't know.
I tried to go through twitter and he 

27
00:01:03,151 --> 00:01:03,990
wrote me,
he was like,

28
00:01:03,991 --> 00:01:04,824
oh don't you remember we?
And then he just told a story that 

29
00:01:07,621 --> 00:01:11,940
didn't happen about a,
I can't remember.

30
00:01:11,941 --> 00:01:14,010
I mean I have it on here if you want to 
look it up.

31
00:01:14,011 --> 00:01:14,844
But uh,
and it was just like I don't want 

32
00:01:15,961 --> 00:01:17,880
anything to do with this guy.
This guy's a liar.

33
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,273
So,
but now this is the first time I ever 

34
00:01:20,431 --> 00:01:24,570
talked about it cause I'm more,
cause he has obviously access to my best

35
00:01:24,571 --> 00:01:26,160
word,
you know,

36
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,610
so,
so your past what?

37
00:01:27,611 --> 00:01:30,690
I had two accounts I had at Fetterman,
which is my main one.

38
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:31,890
Am I talking too loud?
No.

39
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,360
Okay.
I had a,

40
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,080
I get excited.
Okay,

41
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,070
well that's something to be excited 
about.

42
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:42,210
I mean that's your fucking name and 
someone stole it.

43
00:01:42,211 --> 00:01:43,044
I had a fetterman and I had at Wayne,
Wayne Fetterman had them both and one 

44
00:01:46,861 --> 00:01:47,694
was just going to be to put people to 
add fetterman cause I liked that one a 

45
00:01:50,461 --> 00:01:51,900
little better.
Why do you like that one better?

46
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,380
That's a good question.
These are already good.

47
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,383
All right.
Let me think.

48
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,810
I didn't know what was going to get this
intense.

49
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:03,600
It's early crazy.
These conversations or I don't know.

50
00:02:03,601 --> 00:02:04,434
I just like,
I liked the simplicity of it more than 

51
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,370
Wayne Fetterman.
Well,

52
00:02:08,371 --> 00:02:10,650
it's a,
it's an unusual last name isn't a lot of

53
00:02:10,651 --> 00:02:13,770
Fetterman's so you could,
you could hang onto it like that,

54
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,220
you know?
So let me turn it back on you.

55
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:19,110
Am I allowed to do that or just to 
answer?

56
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,320
We're friends.
Okay.

57
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:26,730
Sophie to the for 22 years at Rogen,
um,

58
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,893
I don't think so.

59
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,620
You don't want that?
I mean,

60
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,790
Joe Rogan is small name Joe.
It's quick.

61
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:33,830
Yeah.
Gin.

62
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,910
It's not hard.
I don't like the name Wayne.

63
00:02:35,911 --> 00:02:36,744
So it,
anyway,

64
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,650
but I bought Joe Rogan.
There was another guy named Joe Rogan.

65
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,570
His identity.
Yeah,

66
00:02:43,571 --> 00:02:43,921
yeah,
yeah.

67
00:02:43,921 --> 00:02:46,020
It was his real name.
I had a,

68
00:02:46,021 --> 00:02:50,070
I think I had originally Joe Rogan 
experience,

69
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,023
like the same as the podcast name.
I think that's what originally what I 

70
00:02:53,071 --> 00:02:53,940
had.
Right.

71
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,010
And uh,
this guy had Joe Rogan.

72
00:02:56,011 --> 00:02:58,530
So I contacted him and a,
I said,

73
00:02:58,531 --> 00:02:59,590
hey man,
can I buy it from you?

74
00:02:59,591 --> 00:03:00,424
And he said,
sure.

75
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,910
And he sold to me.
Am I allowed to ask?

76
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,340
I don't remember.
I don't know.

77
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,550
Get a number.
I don't remember.

78
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,800
Wait a minute,
now that I'm thinking about this,

79
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:12,820
this might not totally be true.
That might be my space.

80
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:17,110
I think my space I bought,
I think I bought Joe Rogan on my space.

81
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,820
When was the last time you were on my 
space?

82
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,220
Oh,
it's been never,

83
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,753
it wasn't even me.
I think every seven years you're a new 

84
00:03:24,131 --> 00:03:24,964
person.
They say that your cells completely 

85
00:03:27,161 --> 00:03:28,690
swapped out of that.
As a kid,

86
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,580
it's not really me.
So seven years.

87
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,200
It's been more than seven years for 
sure.

88
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:33,723
It's weird,
right?

89
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,670
It's weird how like some people just 
decide,

90
00:03:36,671 --> 00:03:37,504
like everybody was saying,
but my space is dead and then 

91
00:03:39,431 --> 00:03:40,160
everybody's like,
Shit.

92
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,310
Mindspace is dead time to get the fuck 
out of there.

93
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,110
And I'm still,
I'm still on there.

94
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,490
Are you?
Come on.

95
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:47,980
I never check it or anything,
but it's use it.

96
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,420
No,
no,

97
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:53,900
but does it,
I still feel like I'm on there and there

98
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:56,590
was a girl.
Can I make a recommendation about a girl

99
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,590
on my space now?
She's on Youtube,

100
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:00,723
she's on youtube,
but she wrote a song years ago on the 

101
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:05,014
Ukulele,
which is one of the many instruments I 

102
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:07,440
play,
you know,

103
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,630
and it was called,
my hope is in the name of the song.

104
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,463
It's my recommend and it's about parents
forgetting their password to shut down 

105
00:04:17,081 --> 00:04:19,570
their myspace account and their kids as 
teenagers.

106
00:04:19,571 --> 00:04:22,870
Reading that in the future.
I tried to shut my mind space down.

107
00:04:22,871 --> 00:04:24,580
There wasn't no good.
It couldn't shut it down.

108
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,653
Yeah.
I don't think they want anybody to shut 

109
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:26,950
it out.
They don't.

110
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,620
I think they think somehow or another 
it's going to come back,

111
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,440
but then it just gets sold again.
Yeah,

112
00:04:32,441 --> 00:04:34,930
but that's what I'm saying.
I think like they keep trying to move it

113
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:36,880
around and sell eight if I'm not 
mistaken.

114
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,280
And I know,
I don't know if you're into bands,

115
00:04:39,281 --> 00:04:40,960
we're going to find out to find out a 
lot about you,

116
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:45,550
but like I feel like bands still have a 
presence on my space.

117
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,850
Jamie,
not bands you want to see.

118
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,180
I don't think anyone's on there.
I think it's a dead zone.

119
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,190
Okay.
All right.

120
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,700
Did you ever see that movie?
Yes,

121
00:04:55,701 --> 00:04:56,650
I did.
A Cronenberg.

122
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,760
That's a good one.
A good movie.

123
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,550
Yeah.
I read the book too.

124
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,590
Why would book,
do you read a lot of those times?

125
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,430
I can't read fiction really just gets 
wet.

126
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,960
We're learning about Wayne fetterman 
today.

127
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,970
I read both.
I prefer fiction though,

128
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,440
I think for reading,
but a,

129
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:12,274
I like reading nonfiction too.
I'm reading a book about coyotes right 

130
00:05:14,711 --> 00:05:16,720
now.
Obviously fiction.

131
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,613
No.

132
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:23,260
Well,
you can have a nonfiction talking,

133
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:29,850
like why would you say what's kind of 
the title even sounds like fiction.

134
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,990
It's like a spiritual and supernatural 
history of God,

135
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,000
you know,
and give me one fact.

136
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,990
I need to know about a coyote or wolves.
The same family.

137
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,190
Same.
All of them.

138
00:05:42,191 --> 00:05:45,280
Exactly the same animal.
They're like a dog is exactly that.

139
00:05:45,281 --> 00:05:45,671
Like,
you know,

140
00:05:45,671 --> 00:05:48,640
a dog can breed with dogs.
Coyotes are wolves.

141
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:49,474
There are small wolf,
and they were originally called prairie 

142
00:05:50,981 --> 00:05:51,990
wolves.
Here's,

143
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:52,900
yeah,
I remember that.

144
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:57,380
Here's the history of the name Coyote.
They used to call the people that landed

145
00:05:57,381 --> 00:05:58,640
here.
He used to call them,

146
00:05:58,641 --> 00:05:59,061
you know,
the,

147
00:05:59,061 --> 00:06:01,250
the early settlers called them prairie 
wolves.

148
00:06:01,251 --> 00:06:03,730
When they first encountered him,
like Lewis and Clark there,

149
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,530
the first shot one,
and they thought it was a fox.

150
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:07,640
They wanted to see what it was.

151
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,500
They shot it,
they examined it and they said,

152
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:11,570
that's not a wall fox,
it's a small wolf,

153
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,940
classic light guy.
Let's examine this shoot and kill it,

154
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,320
kill it,
and let's take a look a little.

155
00:06:17,321 --> 00:06:18,320
We got here.
So,

156
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,570
um,
they used to call him prairie wolves and

157
00:06:20,571 --> 00:06:25,100
then the trappers in counted a native 
Americans who,

158
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,360
uh,
called them,

159
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:27,283
uh,
Co call you cause that was the Aztec 

160
00:06:30,411 --> 00:06:32,480
word for them.
The Aztec word was coit.

161
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,180
And then the trappers,
um,

162
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,210
encountered,
uh,

163
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:38,900
or the,
uh,

164
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,210
native Americans encountered Spanish,
uh,

165
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,020
people from Spain.
They called it [inaudible] because they,

166
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:49,220
they had the Spanish pronunciation of 
the word coil.

167
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:53,780
And then the trappers could not say 
[inaudible].

168
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:57,210
So they started calling them coyotes,
coyotes,

169
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:01,220
coyote and prairie wolf.
Those are the original names.

170
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,910
And of course [inaudible],
which was the yet as technique.

171
00:07:04,911 --> 00:07:08,090
And you still have 420 more pages to go.

172
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,110
The books.
Fascinating.

173
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,150
It's really fascinating.
What's really fascinating.

174
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,010
It's by this guy,
Dan Flores.

175
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,740
What's really fascinating,
that name,

176
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:16,603
there's the book right there.
You see it up on the screen and natural 

177
00:07:18,891 --> 00:07:21,960
and supernatural history.
Oh,

178
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,480
why you would,
um,

179
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:27,620
what's interesting is the,
the more like the reason why coyotes are

180
00:07:27,621 --> 00:07:30,050
all over the country now,
they're in every single state.

181
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,420
Every single city.
Even in Hawaii.

182
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,730
No,
they're not in Hawaii as a state.

183
00:07:34,731 --> 00:07:36,680
It's not really,
so it's a country we stole.

184
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,440
We still an island from a bunch of Brown
people.

185
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,520
It's fucked up,
Wayne.

186
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,590
It's called a state.
It's bullshit.

187
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,480
The last date,
it's their own country.

188
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,110
1959 it came,
she gave me,

189
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,250
I don't buy it.
It's going down.

190
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,480
Leave him alone.
He's very,

191
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,440
and I feel like anybody,
I think they should,

192
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,450
you know,
probably protected by us,

193
00:07:56,451 --> 00:07:59,960
but that's their own country.
I feel like that give it back.

194
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:00,883
Like,
yeah,

195
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,220
we'll make a deal hung.

196
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,480
Yay.
What was 10?

197
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,240
It was a matter Australia,
but yeah,

198
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,120
it was about the aborigines.
Yeah.

199
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,230
How do we stay here?
Give it back.

200
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,760
Yeah.
Yeah,

201
00:08:19,761 --> 00:08:20,594
that's right.
They would drive around that time has 

202
00:08:22,311 --> 00:08:25,550
come to say,
hey,

203
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,780
hey.
Oh Shit.

204
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,023
Wow.
What is that band now that I think they 

205
00:08:33,321 --> 00:08:34,154
were a one hit wonder,
but I remember the like the lead singer 

206
00:08:37,881 --> 00:08:41,750
was like bald guy.
Yeah.

207
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,880
Very intense.
Very intense something.

208
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,430
Boy,
I'll think of it.

209
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:47,480
I think.
Not Remember,

210
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,880
but I remember that.
You give it back.

211
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,920
Yeah man.
What about Alaska?

212
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,180
Give it back.
Nope,

213
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,980
that's ours.
We own that shit even though it's not

214
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,360
part of the,
who else did you ask?

215
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:02,550
Who else owns it?
Who Canada?

216
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,170
Give it to Canada.
Fought it down.

217
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,183
Give it to Russia.
So give it back to Russia and then that 

218
00:09:07,061 --> 00:09:08,910
connected to Canada,
which is connected to us.

219
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,580
I'm just saying that for giving up a 
why.

220
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,073
Well,
I'm just talking about the last two 

221
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:16,770
states that became,
if that Alaska was its own country,

222
00:09:16,771 --> 00:09:17,604
couldn't defend itself.
Plus there's a lot of military in 

223
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,640
Alaska.
US military.

224
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,200
I say we keep Alaska.
Okay,

225
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,303
so we're back to 49 states to help the 
flag because then you can do the seven 

226
00:09:27,511 --> 00:09:29,070
by seven right?
Well,

227
00:09:29,071 --> 00:09:29,904
that's the other thing.
Hawaii has their own flag like they 

228
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,110
does,
but they have,

229
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,660
they really have their own flag.
Carry it around with them.

230
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,970
Like they,
they express it.

231
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,343
Every state has a flag.
But when was the last time you saw 

232
00:09:41,671 --> 00:09:44,700
somebody driving around with a 
California flag hanging off the car?

233
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:45,563
True.
Can they speak in a flag or something 

234
00:09:46,891 --> 00:09:47,724
crazy?
You might have spoken about it on the 

235
00:09:49,111 --> 00:09:52,950
show.
You've done 200 829 so I don't know.

236
00:09:52,951 --> 00:09:55,530
I haven't listened to all of them.
I assume you have,

237
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:58,980
but six flags.
Great adventure.

238
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:00,360
You're familiar with it?
Yes.

239
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,220
Do you know the six flags?
No.

240
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,990
You curious?
Sure.

241
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:08,910
There the six flags that have flown over
the state of Texas.

242
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,970
Whoa.
If we can go through them.

243
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,140
Yeah,
let's do it.

244
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:16,680
Oh,
there's more than that's Texas is that,

245
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:17,820
it's not a state,
right?

246
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,500
It's a republic.
It's a stage.

247
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:23,130
It's like they can kind of bail.
They kicked their estate.

248
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,690
There's,
it's not about bailing before.

249
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:30,780
There's people that always talk about 
the seeding is the word that he is going

250
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,230
to bail.
We're gonna bail.

251
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,960
You got to map out to this liberal 
bullshit.

252
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,850
Okay.
So obviously United States,

253
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:42,720
right?
Texas state of Texas flag,

254
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:47,370
right?
Spain Spanish flag flew in Texas.

255
00:10:47,371 --> 00:10:48,060
Yeah,
yeah,

256
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,050
yeah.
But yeah,

257
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,100
cause it was Spanish territory.
Yeah.

258
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,500
Um,
Mexico,

259
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,840
I believe Mexico,
we here it goes late.

260
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:00,030
Don't,
there's one crazy one.

261
00:11:00,031 --> 00:11:03,360
This is the crazy one.
There's a French,

262
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,223
because it was obviously the French 
hounded did for awhile as a part of the 

263
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,820
Louisiana purchase.
Right?

264
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:09,930
Oh,
that's right.

265
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,360
Um,
but here's the craziest one.

266
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,610
Confederate.
You know,

267
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:20,170
so when you say go to six flags,
the sixth flag is the confederate flag.

268
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,990
That's not cool.

269
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:27,840
I actually think it is Kinda cool.
It's Kinda like,

270
00:11:27,841 --> 00:11:30,120
if you think about it,
you're like it at this meme,

271
00:11:30,121 --> 00:11:31,140
muse by park.
You're like,

272
00:11:31,141 --> 00:11:32,430
oh,
that is the French part.

273
00:11:32,431 --> 00:11:34,640
That's the heat confederate part.
That's the,

274
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,753
it's weird that it was not that far long
ago that the confederate flag was on a 

275
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:43,770
car that was on television every day.
Right.

276
00:11:43,771 --> 00:11:44,970
You're talking about?
Uh,

277
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,160
the generally,
yeah,

278
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:49,400
a daisy dukes.
I remember that.

279
00:11:49,401 --> 00:11:51,780
Yeah.
The flag was on TV.

280
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,980
First of all,
the flag is

281
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,370
still part of the state of Georgia state
flag if I'm not mistaken.

282
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,110
Yeah.
Oh,

283
00:11:59,111 --> 00:12:01,230
that's ugly.
That's especially why,

284
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:05,860
I feel like in the last 15 years it's 
taken a turn.

285
00:12:05,861 --> 00:12:07,300
But before that,
Leonard skinner,

286
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:10,180
if you ever went to one of their shows,
did you know,

287
00:12:10,181 --> 00:12:11,014
but they,
they used to failure with demand there 

288
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:15,180
from Florida.
Leonard skinner.

289
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,360
Yeah.
They're from Florida.

290
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,080
I'm a huge Leonard Skinner Fan.
Where in Florida?

291
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,180
I Dunno.
Somewhere that sucks.

292
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,730
Cause I know Tom Petty from Gainsville.
Yeah.

293
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,410
Did you know I grew up in Florida?
Olson?

294
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:33,070
I used to live in Gainesville.
I lived in Gainesville for three years.

295
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,870
I was a little kid.
Oh,

296
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,730
from the time I was 11,
12,

297
00:12:36,731 --> 00:12:38,530
13.
Let's see what we got here.

298
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,550
There's the,
uh,

299
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,810
there's the flag to 2001.
Yeah,

300
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,880
up until 2001.
Yeah,

301
00:12:45,881 --> 00:12:46,714
because I remember when Jimmy Carter 
accepted the nomination in [inaudible] 

302
00:12:50,231 --> 00:12:51,064
76 there was like a big,
it looked like a confederate flag 

303
00:12:53,651 --> 00:12:55,960
because they had the Georgia delegation 
right down front.

304
00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:00,370
That's crazy.
Up Til 2001 they had a fucking,

305
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,630
or is it 2006 yeah,
that's what I'm saying.

306
00:13:02,631 --> 00:13:03,880
In the last 15 yet.
No,

307
00:13:03,881 --> 00:13:05,740
you nailed it.
That was their state flag.

308
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:10,210
That's insane,
dude.

309
00:13:10,211 --> 00:13:12,510
Same Dukes of hazzard style.
Yeah.

310
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:16,430
But dukes of Hazzard at least has a TV 
show about a bunch of rednecks that are,

311
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,540
you know,
they run from the law and some moonshine

312
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:23,800
or they used to sell moonshine.
I guess I didn't watch that.

313
00:13:23,801 --> 00:13:25,000
Share that all there was a show.
Yeah,

314
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:25,893
no,
I know.

315
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:28,600
I've seen the picture of the guy.
I find,

316
00:13:28,601 --> 00:13:30,370
I guess maybe because I grew up in the 
south,

317
00:13:30,371 --> 00:13:32,890
like the confederate flag.
Not Crazy offensive,

318
00:13:32,891 --> 00:13:35,800
but now it's like the Nazi flag,
right?

319
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:38,800
Yeah.
But it's amazing how it was accepted.

320
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,620
It was accepted.
The London scattered things.

321
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:42,454
A perfect example.
The fact that learns skinner had that 

322
00:13:44,171 --> 00:13:46,330
flag flying everywhere.

323
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,193
Yeah.
Yeah.

324
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,453
And now you could never do that.
You could just can't do that in a less 

325
00:13:51,671 --> 00:13:52,504
specifically.
That was what you were trying to be 

326
00:13:53,711 --> 00:13:55,720
provocative.
Oh Man.

327
00:13:55,721 --> 00:13:57,700
But here there's linen skins flight 
that,

328
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,440
yeah,
that was the logo.

329
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,090
What?
That never flies there.

330
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,620
Now Leonard Skinner without,
with the surviving members.

331
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,650
Uh,
you know,

332
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:08,710
[inaudible] it's not really Leonard 
Skinner,

333
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:09,603
but you know the,
what they're calling Leonard skinner 

334
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,700
skinner.
It's Leonardo's very close.

335
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,760
They don't,
they don't try to rock that any more.

336
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:20,620
They gave,
I'd like to know,

337
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,450
and I,
Jamie's over here doing it.

338
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,400
I don't know what year they did give up 
on it,

339
00:14:24,401 --> 00:14:27,730
but it within the last 15 years that 
they were like,

340
00:14:27,731 --> 00:14:32,110
it's now a symbol of hate as opposed to 
a cultural situation.

341
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:32,921
Yeah.
Was a little,

342
00:14:32,921 --> 00:14:36,400
it's about the culture of the south.
It's about the culture.

343
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:38,920
Yeah.
It was kind of,

344
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,740
the culture is kind of connected to 
something fucked up.

345
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:44,080
You're talking about slavery.
You got to let it go.

346
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,600
Is that what you mean?
Yes.

347
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,540
You got to let it go.
That's what I thought.

348
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:52,190
So we got to,
we went through the Securitas route

349
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,660
to this coyote thing.
Uh,

350
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:55,700
by killing coyotes,
you,

351
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,460
you forced the females to have more 
babies.

352
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:01,700
The females litters increase.
There are very strange animal.

353
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,773
Like if they call,
like when you hear coyotes call in the 

354
00:15:04,521 --> 00:15:06,920
middle of the [inaudible],
do it again.

355
00:15:06,921 --> 00:15:07,754
Do it again.

356
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:13,660
It's a weird sound.
The first time I heard it for some,

357
00:15:13,661 --> 00:15:14,770
I moved to California.
I was like,

358
00:15:14,771 --> 00:15:17,530
what the fuck is that?
But when I moved here,

359
00:15:17,531 --> 00:15:19,570
he's a perfect example.
In 94,

360
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,760
uh,
when I was living in New York,

361
00:15:21,761 --> 00:15:25,210
there's no fucking coyotes where I was 
living like I was living in men.

362
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:26,680
No,
I was in new Rochelle.

363
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,330
There's,
but there's coyotes near now.

364
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,840
There's coyotes in Westchester.
There's coyotes in New York City.

365
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,130
They've actually gone into the city.
There's a bunch of B.

366
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,183
Dot.
At one.

367
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:40,660
They are the opposite of a danger.
They are everywhere.

368
00:15:40,661 --> 00:15:44,620
They are one of the most prevalent large
animals in North America.

369
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,900
They are everywhere.
They're in every single state.

370
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,113
Just million questions.
What is the population increased since 

371
00:15:52,331 --> 00:15:53,860
the Lewis and Clark?
Hundred percent.

372
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,420
Yes.
Not only that,

373
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:56,254
the range,
the range is increased when they're 

374
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,773
there.
What's interesting about them is when 

375
00:15:59,891 --> 00:16:01,780
they're persecuted,
they spread out.

376
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:04,060
They expand their range when they're 
persecuted,

377
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:06,010
just like Jews.
Wow.

378
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,510
I'm kidding.
I'm Jill.

379
00:16:07,511 --> 00:16:09,670
You're allowed to say that.
You could say that.

380
00:16:09,671 --> 00:16:11,440
I can't,
you couldn't say that.

381
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,670
I don't want to get in trouble.
Okay.

382
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:14,860
Especially I was wearing a confederate 
flag after,

383
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,713
sorry.

384
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,240
Anyway,
um,

385
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:20,590
cody books.
Awesome.

386
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,690
How do we get to that?
We're talking about books.

387
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,560
Nonfiction.
Yeah.

388
00:16:23,561 --> 00:16:24,670
We were tiny.
We were asking you about,

389
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,900
you were talking about some book now.
I was,

390
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,610
we were just talking about,
I was saying that I don't read fiction.

391
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:32,710
What,
and you just said,

392
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,610
that's the last thing I'm reading.
I read only fig.

393
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,210
I can't get into it.
Really?

394
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,850
Yeah.
I could get into a coyote book,

395
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:41,710
you know,
a nonfiction,

396
00:16:41,711 --> 00:16:42,560
but,
but I like a,

397
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,830
uh,
like a Jack London story.

398
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:48,820
Has It always been that way?
Well,

399
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,271
I,
you know,

400
00:16:49,271 --> 00:16:53,460
you had to in school read those books.
Yeah.

401
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,303
You were forced to.
We never got into books like they were 

402
00:16:55,991 --> 00:16:57,880
never like fascinating.
My brother was,

403
00:16:57,881 --> 00:16:58,714
but I was not,
he had Robert Heinlein and all that 

404
00:17:00,881 --> 00:17:02,890
science fiction books and I know that,
I mean,

405
00:17:02,891 --> 00:17:06,050
I've read a few and uh,
I just get,

406
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,680
I just get,
I love movies.

407
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:12,370
Like that's how I get my fiction.
Well,

408
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,323
movies are better if they're done right.
What's really better is television 

409
00:17:16,781 --> 00:17:18,500
shows.
The long form TV show.

410
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,320
But you'd like thrones.
Yeah,

411
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:24,210
because it's,
they can go so much more like a novel,

412
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:25,900
a novel.
It's like a novel.

413
00:17:25,901 --> 00:17:30,901
But you're seeing it and you're seeing,
I'm using amazing acting and music.

414
00:17:30,911 --> 00:17:33,380
Exposed breasts.
Right.

415
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,430
That's what's happening.
Yeah.

416
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,980
Because the one time I don't watch game 
of thrones,

417
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:42,490
but they both times I tuned in,
I've seen negative breasts.

418
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:46,420
Is it every week they try.
That's just to get ratings.

419
00:17:46,421 --> 00:17:47,171
How does that work?
Well,

420
00:17:47,171 --> 00:17:48,730
no,
because I think people back then to show

421
00:17:48,731 --> 00:17:49,920
their tits lot what?

422
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,810
Yeah,
it's not real.

423
00:17:51,811 --> 00:17:54,570
It's not back then,
it's not even a real play in the future.

424
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,460
It could be absolutely like star wars.
Yeah.

425
00:17:57,461 --> 00:18:00,060
Long time ago in a galaxy far,
far away.

426
00:18:00,061 --> 00:18:01,620
Like you would think star wars is in the
future,

427
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:02,663
but it's actually in the past.
He would think game of thrones in the 

428
00:18:04,411 --> 00:18:06,120
past,
but it might actually be in the future.

429
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:09,660
Speaking of Star Wars,
I just stumped a star wars and that.

430
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,600
How'd you do that?
It was about that song done.

431
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,500
Don Don,
Don Antenna,

432
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:15,900
the antenna,
you know,

433
00:18:15,901 --> 00:18:19,030
that's the darth vader's theme.
There's actually a,

434
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,640
that's not the actual name of that song,
but it's,

435
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:22,523
um,
but that song was not in the original 

436
00:18:24,841 --> 00:18:26,640
star wars,
but yeah,

437
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,140
it wasn't.
No.

438
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,810
Oh my God.
I've talked to a guy,

439
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:30,780
he's like,
you're wrong.

440
00:18:30,781 --> 00:18:32,220
I was like,
well you're wrong.

441
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,550
And because I happened to be a nice guy.

442
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,480
I know when I'm know I'm right.
I know.

443
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,180
I'll never bet somebody,
oh,

444
00:18:39,181 --> 00:18:40,290
what a nice guy.
Yeah,

445
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,380
cause she was laid out.
I know.

446
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,340
I know how much you think you could've 
gotten out of them.

447
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,900
I don't know.
Maybe 10,

448
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,580
10,000
maybe 10 to I'm alone dollars.

449
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,513
I think it could have easily got,
he was convinced because you're a rich 

450
00:18:52,891 --> 00:18:53,724
guy.
He was a guy at the bar or we're just 

451
00:18:56,491 --> 00:18:58,770
talking about star wars.
I've seen him all the thing.

452
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:01,240
He had a shirt should have went in,
um,

453
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:03,060
March of the,
what is it called?

454
00:19:03,061 --> 00:19:06,600
March of the called the imperial March.
March.

455
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:10,290
Thank you Tom.
Thumb down.

456
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,250
Oh,
John Williams.

457
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,930
He's unbelievable.
Um,

458
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,030
is that from the second one?
First strikes back?

459
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:19,860
Yes.
Wow.

460
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:20,723
Yeah.
Interesting.

461
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,950
I know you wouldn't think so,
right?

462
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,110
A little bit of trimming.
Not Surprise.

463
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,240
Now that you said it,
I'm not surprised.

464
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:32,270
They all kind of blend in probably the 
perfect age to see star wars as a kid.

465
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,740
I saw star wars a bunch of times as a 
kid.

466
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:35,843
It was one of those things where I think
I might've saw it 13 times or something 

467
00:19:38,851 --> 00:19:41,970
crazy because it's one of those things 
where kids in school with how many times

468
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,220
you seen star wars?
I've seen the 20,

469
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,410
you know,
there was always listens.

470
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,070
You're from Jersey?
No,

471
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,850
I was born in New Jersey,
but I only lived there until I was six.

472
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:56,090
I spent my seventh birthday in a car on 
the way to San Francisco.

473
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:59,880
I lived in San Francisco from seven to 
11,

474
00:19:59,881 --> 00:20:00,714
lived in Gainesville,
Florida from 11 to 13 Boston from 13 to 

475
00:20:04,561 --> 00:20:08,280
2124,
24,

476
00:20:08,281 --> 00:20:09,114
I guess.

477
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:10,280
And then,
uh,

478
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,700
somewhere 23,
I guess.

479
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,480
And then New York for a couple of years 
and then here,

480
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:16,800
then here.
Here.

481
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,870
Wow.
Yeah.

482
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:23,280
Are you facebook friends?
Are you on facebook like per night?

483
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,060
Very.
I use facebook only in that instagram is

484
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:28,380
connected to facebook.
Okay.

485
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:33,240
I don't go there and I just,
are you friends from any of you have any

486
00:20:33,241 --> 00:20:36,570
friends from your San Francisco years 
you're still in touch with?

487
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,730
No.
So only on Warfarin,

488
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,500
only Boston.
Boston in New York.

489
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,401
No.
What,

490
00:20:41,401 --> 00:20:43,650
you've never gone to a show and 
someone's come up to you and go,

491
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,020
no.
You know,

492
00:20:46,021 --> 00:20:48,070
when you're a little kid,
it's hard to stay friends

493
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,440
with people for that long,
you know,

494
00:20:49,441 --> 00:20:50,274
like that you don't,
if you don't stay in the neighborhood 

495
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,770
and stay in the area.
Yeah.

496
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,390
And uh,
I just didn't stay there that long.

497
00:20:55,391 --> 00:20:57,190
I only lived there.
We moved around a lot,

498
00:20:57,191 --> 00:20:59,680
man,
which obviously not good for you.

499
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:03,160
I moved around as a kid.
I mean maybe not as much as you,

500
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:04,270
but similar,
similar,

501
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:05,770
similar to that.
Yeah.

502
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,260
It,
it's,

503
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,093
it's,
I don't think it's that healthy for 

504
00:21:08,051 --> 00:21:09,260
kids.
I don't think it,

505
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,113
I thought it was good.
I thought I learned a lot of great 

506
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:14,140
skills.
We definitely do.

507
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:16,780
You learn people skills and learn how to
communicate with people,

508
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,033
but you also don't,
I feel like that's a pretty important 

509
00:21:21,851 --> 00:21:22,960
thing in life.
It is.

510
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:23,883
But I also think that some people,
they gain something by being secure and 

511
00:21:27,281 --> 00:21:29,850
having friends and a community 
confidence.

512
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:30,743
Yeah.

513
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:31,953
Yeah.
Are you saying you're not implying 

514
00:21:35,021 --> 00:21:37,210
you're not confident guy?
Um,

515
00:21:37,211 --> 00:21:38,044
I think I got my confidence from martial
arts and I went to martial arts because 

516
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,340
it didn't have any confidence.
Oh my God,

517
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,900
I'm going to start crying because it's 
sad.

518
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:49,390
Just the most sensitive I've ever seen 
you in my life.

519
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,673
What is happening?
I think that sensitive is that 

520
00:21:52,571 --> 00:21:53,440
sensitive?
Yeah.

521
00:21:53,441 --> 00:21:54,820
You're less like,
I was just,

522
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,400
now all of a sudden I see this kid,
you know,

523
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:58,263
eyes darting around,
no friends all of a sudden like it was 

524
00:22:00,191 --> 00:22:02,110
Maine really?
Oh yeah,

525
00:22:02,111 --> 00:22:03,760
for sure.
Oh my God.

526
00:22:03,761 --> 00:22:05,470
And then you were like,
I need something.

527
00:22:05,471 --> 00:22:08,980
And so you started taking steroids and 
doing martial arts economy?

528
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:11,440
They were,
and I didn't take steroids.

529
00:22:11,441 --> 00:22:13,660
I'm kidding.
What I did in high school,

530
00:22:13,661 --> 00:22:16,030
take some when I was older.
You did?

531
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:16,781
Yeah.
Oh,

532
00:22:16,781 --> 00:22:19,420
I had no,
yeah,

533
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:19,600
no.

534
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,330
Most of this stuff I took was stuff that
you could buy at Gnc,

535
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:23,853
but uh,
they used to sell stuff at Gnc that's 

536
00:22:25,991 --> 00:22:28,500
now totally alive when,
what do you call which doing?

537
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,630
Mcguire was hitting him.
He was stinking real steroids.

538
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,340
I would,
you know,

539
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,410
he was lying.
Yeah,

540
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,293
100%.
But there was something that's now with 

541
00:22:36,101 --> 00:22:38,110
legal at g and C.
Yeah.

542
00:22:38,111 --> 00:22:39,520
A bunch of those things.
Yeah.

543
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:40,971
Yeah.
But the,

544
00:22:40,971 --> 00:22:41,804
there's stuff that you take now,
like there's an issue that's going on 

545
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:45,693
constantly with UFC fighters where they 
go to some sort of a vitamin store and 

546
00:22:50,831 --> 00:22:51,664
buy some stuff.
And it turns out that these supplements 

547
00:22:53,931 --> 00:22:56,020
that they're buying have steroids in 
them.

548
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,670
Steroids.
Steroids.

549
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,400
Wow.
Yes.

550
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,190
You okay?
When you till you said you did take?

551
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:04,783
Yes,
I took the strong strongest shit ever 

552
00:23:06,641 --> 00:23:07,474
took was a stuff that's totally illegal.
Now it's called Mag 10 and when you 

553
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,053
just,
cause I've never taken anything like 

554
00:23:13,781 --> 00:23:14,080
that.

555
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,913
Can you,
can you feel it like when you take it 

556
00:23:16,751 --> 00:23:19,030
like what?
What's the real body recovers?

557
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:20,350
Better recovers.
Yeah.

558
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,030
That's really neat.
Better?

559
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,310
No,
not on the stuff that I took.

560
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:27,250
How many hours do some stuff I try to 
sleep a solid eight.

561
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:31,000
I think it's super important.
It's one of the most important things as

562
00:23:31,001 --> 00:23:34,000
far as a relaxation recovery.
You know,

563
00:23:34,001 --> 00:23:37,090
if you work out a lot and you did,
did you work at earlier today?

564
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,133
Yeah,
it worked out today.

565
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,940
Wow.
That's impressive.

566
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,550
Why is it impressive?
You don't work out?

567
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,890
I play basketball and tennis.
Those are workouts.

568
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:46,521
Dyno,
I know,

569
00:23:46,521 --> 00:23:47,390
but I,
I don't,

570
00:23:47,391 --> 00:23:49,580
don't really do them in the morning that
often.

571
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:53,450
When you do them like in the afternoon,
so you'll ease into your day.

572
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,690
He's so to do that kind of comedian.
Yeah.

573
00:23:56,691 --> 00:23:57,524
Well that's most of us.
Most of us ease into the day I would 

574
00:23:59,781 --> 00:24:00,614
assume.

575
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:01,783
I get up and I attack that motherfucker.
I like to work out hard first thing in 

576
00:24:04,971 --> 00:24:08,540
the morning like this.
Do you do these lifting weights?

577
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,750
Do these,
he's doing the,

578
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,593
he's,
he's doing the pressing motion and do 

579
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,320
some of those,
these,

580
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:15,561
the curls.
Well,

581
00:24:15,561 --> 00:24:18,500
most of the weightlifting than I do is 
with kettle bells.

582
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:19,813
Oh yeah.
I know that those things behind you on 

583
00:24:21,261 --> 00:24:22,680
the ground.
Those are kettlebells.

584
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:24,650
Yeah.
Those were the one when I said yes,

585
00:24:24,651 --> 00:24:27,200
I knew what they were and I didn't 
really have to turn around and look,

586
00:24:27,201 --> 00:24:29,860
I don't know exactly what the right,
do you want me to try to lift it?

587
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,280
No.
Maybe later.

588
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,020
Maybe.
I don't want you to get hurt.

589
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,660
Okay.
Can I flash forward?

590
00:24:34,661 --> 00:24:38,180
I have more workout questions.
When does this,

591
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,010
how did,
how do we know this is over?

592
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:42,650
We decided we'd say it's over right here
and say it.

593
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,170
We can pull the plug right now.
Now we want to do it.

594
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,190
No,
no.

595
00:24:46,191 --> 00:24:47,720
I'm enjoying it.
I'm enjoying it.

596
00:24:47,721 --> 00:24:50,090
I just want to know because if I run out
of steam,

597
00:24:50,091 --> 00:24:50,960
go like,
I'm going to,

598
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:52,370
I'm going to do this.
Just go.

599
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:52,950
Don't,
I'm going to do,

600
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:53,783
I'm going to tap out.
But definitely you don't want to think 

601
00:24:54,921 --> 00:24:56,510
about that.
That's all I'm thinking about.

602
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:58,640
You can't think like that.
Oh yeah.

603
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,170
Well that's the same thing with working 
out.

604
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,880
If you,
if you work on your man,

605
00:25:01,881 --> 00:25:03,710
when am I going to get tired?
You'll start getting tired.

606
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,750
Do you have to think about what you're 
doing?

607
00:25:05,751 --> 00:25:06,584
You gotta be getting is I'm getting some
life in the moment mean like it's very 

608
00:25:09,021 --> 00:25:10,240
important.
Of course,

609
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,200
we do almost everything in life.
Right?

610
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:15,170
Did you ever,
do you ever read the right in the middle

611
00:25:15,171 --> 00:25:18,620
of sex going on when this is going to be
over and then it's over?

612
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:20,503
All right,
well that's,

613
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,520
I can't think like that.
Hey,

614
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,840
you understand?
I understand.

615
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,260
I don't really have a problem with that.
Okay.

616
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:30,500
But now it seems like you might think 
you have a problem.

617
00:25:30,501 --> 00:25:33,390
Now all of a sudden that's,
it creeps into your head and that's it.

618
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,600
Did you ever read the book the power of 
now?

619
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,830
You know what I have is that's Eckhart.
Totally.

620
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:39,630
Yeah,
it is.

621
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:43,070
I have that book on audio tape.
I have not finished it.

622
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:48,130
I hope to God it's not him reading it.
I do not know who got the worst.

623
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,550
I don't think speaking voice it,
it's horrible.

624
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,620
But his book is pretty good.
Yeah.

625
00:25:54,621 --> 00:25:56,630
I remember thinking this is kind of 
cool,

626
00:25:56,631 --> 00:25:57,464
but this is a lot of stuff that I 
already kind of practice and kind of 

627
00:25:59,031 --> 00:26:01,040
know into it.
I was,

628
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,140
it was quite a few years ago that it was
listening to it.

629
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,040
The worst guy ever to read his books on.
Let me,

630
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,330
let me hear Stephen King.
Oh really?

631
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,310
Oh God.
He's awful.

632
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:11,900
I mean,
he's one of my favorite authors.

633
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:12,763
I love him.
Did you ever a fan of his read his 

634
00:26:13,971 --> 00:26:14,804
writing?
Right,

635
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,220
but oh my God,
when he reads it,

636
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,740
it's death.
Like you literally want to fucking just,

637
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:22,450
I used to listen to him back when it was
cassettes and uh,

638
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,353
I,
one time I fucking pulled the string 

639
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,850
that the tape out of the cassette.
Right.

640
00:26:28,851 --> 00:26:30,470
So I could never listen to it again.
I'm like,

641
00:26:30,471 --> 00:26:34,400
this is fucking terrible.
And I threw it in the garbage can.

642
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:37,280
You couldn't just throw it in.
You had a hell's mad,

643
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,580
obviously so boring.
His rate,

644
00:26:40,581 --> 00:26:43,010
his reading is so awful.
I remember the book.

645
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,453
Was it Ku?

646
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:45,883
You remember what I've listened to a 
bunch of his stuff on audio tape and 

647
00:26:50,821 --> 00:26:52,770
Actually Duncan was talking about it 
yesterday.

648
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,540
Yeah.
I didn't realize it was Frank Mueller.

649
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,790
That was one of the best guys at reading
it.

650
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:00,120
He did the dark tower series.
He read the dark tower series.

651
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:02,940
Stephen King Book.
But uh,

652
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:03,810
yeah.
Stephen King,

653
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,033
one of my favorite offers.
My least favorite ever reader of his 

654
00:27:07,111 --> 00:27:08,640
work.
That's great.

655
00:27:08,641 --> 00:27:11,040
Favorite author?
Least favorite reader?

656
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,510
Yeah,
that's my Dave King.

657
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:14,370
He,
I don't think is my favorite author.

658
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:16,830
Um,
he might be though.

659
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:19,290
He's fun.
Did you know he's really good too?

660
00:27:19,291 --> 00:27:21,720
His son,
Ernie King.

661
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:24,560
Joe Hill,
I don't know.

662
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,450
His son's name is Joe Hill.
Joe.

663
00:27:27,451 --> 00:27:29,770
Hell wait a minute.
Yeah,

664
00:27:29,771 --> 00:27:33,000
it changed his name so he didn't have to
ride his dad's pony coattails.

665
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:37,560
Ponytails.
Putney tells Joe Hill a famous character

666
00:27:37,561 --> 00:27:40,410
and uh,
I'm going to say,

667
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:42,780
let's say his name right.
I'm not blanking.

668
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:43,830
Emma.
It's Joe Hill.

669
00:27:43,831 --> 00:27:45,000
Heart shaped box.
Yeah,

670
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,890
he's really good.
You don't really know.

671
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:51,170
You don't have the song Joe Hill and 
about the worker who died to jolene.

672
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:56,460
Jolene,
Jolene,

673
00:27:56,670 --> 00:28:00,960
jolene.
There is still fresh.

674
00:28:00,961 --> 00:28:02,880
Looks like Stephen King.
That's crazy.

675
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:05,220
That's him.
That's him.

676
00:28:05,221 --> 00:28:06,480
Joe Hill writer.
Can you,

677
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:07,343
can you do me a favor and look up Joe 
Hill Union activist because I think 

678
00:28:11,311 --> 00:28:13,950
there's a,
did you ever see the movie woodstock?

679
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,710
MMM.

680
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:19,740
Shot in 1969 it was about a music 
festival.

681
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:22,650
Here's the guy upstate New York.
Well,

682
00:28:22,651 --> 00:28:23,484
I know about the music festival,
but I don't think I saw Joe Hill ain't 

683
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,500
dead.
Don't mourn.

684
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:30,480
Organize.
Yeah.

685
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,343
It's about a unit if I,
he like died and some kind of maybe 

686
00:28:34,141 --> 00:28:36,510
union act accident or something like 
that.

687
00:28:36,511 --> 00:28:40,550
Or Osha.
And when Joan Baez sang in,

688
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,470
in Woodstock,
that's one of the songs she's saying,

689
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:44,670
which Joe Hill.
Oh Wow.

690
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,670
I'm wondering if that's why I'm making 
this connection.

691
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,653
Well,
he might changed his name to that on 

692
00:28:50,491 --> 00:28:52,230
purpose.
That's what I'm asking.

693
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,560
Yeah.
Okay.

694
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,940
It could be,
so that is it.

695
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:56,110
I got the name right.
Good.

696
00:28:56,111 --> 00:28:57,660
Sometimes I'm think it's right and it's 
like,

697
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:00,210
oh no,
that was Ernie Hill and messed up.

698
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:00,691
Yeah.
You know,

699
00:29:00,691 --> 00:29:03,120
not sometimes,
like you'll say a word and you're like,

700
00:29:03,121 --> 00:29:05,260
that's not the right word,
but it is the right it is.

701
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,113
Yeah.
Cool.

702
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,370
Especially like the way it's spelled.
You look,

703
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:10,650
look at the way something's spelled like
that can't be right.

704
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:14,320
I wonder if there's a word for it.
I'm looking at it for the hell.

705
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:16,020
I'm looking at the pictures.
Mind.

706
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:17,970
Yeah.
These all mugshots.

707
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,530
Well,
sort of.

708
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,020
They're not.
That's the Elvis Presley's shit.

709
00:29:22,021 --> 00:29:22,854
Two of them.
Bullshit.

710
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:23,723
It's Elvis.
One is bullshit because he was a at the 

711
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,200
White House and he wasn't accidental 
yesterday.

712
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:29,693
No,
I think he took it as a joke and when 

713
00:29:30,891 --> 00:29:33,600
might it be a security thing?
But I think you'd take him.

714
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:34,980
Do you like how he's that way it's 
behind you.

715
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:40,010
I am a fan of what Elvis kind of is.
You know?

716
00:29:40,321 --> 00:29:45,321
He's like this iconic,
crazy Americana figure.

717
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:49,960
I became a drug addict and got all fat 
and sweaty and died on the toilet.

718
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:54,970
I think there's less than later.
Remember there's lessons in Elvis.

719
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,280
I mean I think he certainly was a 
talented singer,

720
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,361
but a,
I'm a,

721
00:29:58,361 --> 00:30:01,300
I'm a fan of him.
More of a cultural icon than I am.

722
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:03,340
Even as a musician.
Jimmy Hendrix.

723
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,330
Yeah.
That's not real.

724
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:09,100
See that is the real writing.
But the actual image is from,

725
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:11,950
uh,
one of the Jimi Hendrix experience,

726
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:14,110
which is where I stole the name for this
podcast.

727
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,380
I love it.
Um,

728
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:16,870
the name of the band?
Yeah.

729
00:30:16,871 --> 00:30:18,240
Made me,
made me feel experiment.

730
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:20,200
What?
Mitch Mitchell there.

731
00:30:20,201 --> 00:30:21,940
That's the real one.
So you up on the screen,

732
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:25,660
that is the actual image.
That's the real image.

733
00:30:25,661 --> 00:30:29,950
He got arrested for heroin in Toronto,
but this picture that I,

734
00:30:29,951 --> 00:30:31,900
and I bought this at a fucking nice 
gallery.

735
00:30:31,901 --> 00:30:35,440
Two of these cons and then Rosa parks.
Yes.

736
00:30:35,441 --> 00:30:38,380
But the Rosa Park one is real.
That's 100% real.

737
00:30:38,381 --> 00:30:40,540
Is that when she,
that's when she got arrested.

738
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:41,830
You know,
she was,

739
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:45,590
a lot of people get that story wrong,
but a lot of people think like,

740
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,473
she sat in the front of the bus and then
was asked to move to the back of the 

741
00:30:50,141 --> 00:30:52,000
bus.
Somebody else had done it before her.

742
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:52,870
Of course,
of course.

743
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:53,723
Of course.
Of course.

744
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:56,440
But even the front of the bus part is 
incorrect.

745
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:57,790
What part,
what is it?

746
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:00,880
It's Kinda,
it's a very mean minute thing,

747
00:31:00,881 --> 00:31:04,870
but I'm like a history dude.
There was a white section in the front,

748
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,550
right?
African American in the book,

749
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,660
in the back.
Uh,

750
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:09,820
at the time they call black or colored 
section.

751
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:12,310
Uh,
she was in the colored section.

752
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,473
But what happened was if the white 
section filled up and a white person 

753
00:31:16,931 --> 00:31:19,150
went back to the color texture and sit 
down,

754
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:21,880
you still had to stand up and give them 
your seat.

755
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,500
Really?
Yeah.

756
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,330
And then she wouldn't do it.
And that's,

757
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:28,030
that was the start of it.
Wow.

758
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,190
I did not know that.
They know it's a small,

759
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,780
you know,
but everyone says,

760
00:31:31,781 --> 00:31:32,920
oh,
she wouldn't go to the back of the book.

761
00:31:32,921 --> 00:31:33,581
It's like,
well,

762
00:31:33,581 --> 00:31:35,440
that's even grosser.
I agree.

763
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:36,550
I agree.
It is.

764
00:31:36,551 --> 00:31:37,384
Grocer just like literally just sitting 
there and then just some guy just got 

765
00:31:40,771 --> 00:31:41,051
to,
yeah,

766
00:31:41,051 --> 00:31:45,880
she's complying with your racist rules 
and then you're like not racist enough.

767
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,120
Yeah.
Yeah.

768
00:31:49,121 --> 00:31:49,930
So,
uh,

769
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:53,110
so then that's when she got arrested.
Parks original seat.

770
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,240
Wow.
You were totally right.

771
00:31:55,241 --> 00:31:56,380
Am I correct?
Yeah.

772
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:57,980
Look at that.
What happened?

773
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:59,620
Ever seen?
I've never seen this picture.

774
00:31:59,621 --> 00:32:01,600
There's a diagram like the Kennedy 
assassination.

775
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:06,460
It looks like the fucking magic bullet.
Rosa parks boarded the bus and sat in an

776
00:32:06,461 --> 00:32:07,294
aisle seat in the designated colored sex
colleagues stops later the driver told 

777
00:32:11,081 --> 00:32:11,914
parks and three other blacks in her row 
to move to the back to make room for a 

778
00:32:18,011 --> 00:32:18,844
white man.
The three blacks moved to the back 

779
00:32:20,501 --> 00:32:23,320
parks,
slid to an adjacent window seat,

780
00:32:23,321 --> 00:32:27,340
refuse to move.
Wait til it was even.

781
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:28,540
It was like,
okay,

782
00:32:28,541 --> 00:32:31,570
just so I'm clear on this,
now that I'm learning something,

783
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:32,703
I almost feel like now,
like they didn't even want him to have 

784
00:32:35,351 --> 00:32:38,530
to sit next to exactly what it was like.
That was an empty seat.

785
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,710
Yup.
That's exactly that.

786
00:32:39,711 --> 00:32:40,070
Right?
Am

787
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,960
I reading that right?
You're absolutely reading it right.

788
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:42,950
It's interesting,
right?

789
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,000
That is,
it's awful.

790
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,253
That's awful.
That's another thing that's not that 

791
00:32:46,971 --> 00:32:47,804
long ago.
All these things that are not that long 

792
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:51,830
ago.
The colored flag being on,

793
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,630
I mean the confederate,
the colored flag,

794
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:58,100
the confederate flag being on the state.
Right.

795
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:00,620
Flag of Georgia.
This,

796
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,150
what year was this?
I want to say this is 16

797
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,190
d

798
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:05,663
what year was it?
I want to say like 61 does that make 

799
00:33:07,741 --> 00:33:10,830
sense?
56 in the late fifties right.

800
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,600
Oh Wow.
I'm totally wrong.

801
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:17,460
Montgomery Alabama system was Lego in 
the graded.

802
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:21,270
Wow.
So good.

803
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,560
We learned,
I learned a little something.

804
00:33:22,561 --> 00:33:23,920
Yeah.
That's fascinating.

805
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:25,780
It's silly.
It's a stage photo.

806
00:33:25,781 --> 00:33:28,070
Then her right there.
Yeah.

807
00:33:28,071 --> 00:33:31,390
Like how if there was a full bus and 
there's a white guy behind her.

808
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,313
What?
Like houses?

809
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:34,160
What's this photo from?
Oh,

810
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:36,010
I see.
So wikipedia photo,

811
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,990
they might've done that after the fact.
Right?

812
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,790
What's in the upper right hand corner?
What does that,

813
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:42,340
is that the actual,
is that like no upper right hand corner,

814
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,140
upper right hand corner that,
yeah.

815
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,800
Mine never seen you yell at somebody 
like,

816
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,940
Yo,
this is the bus where it's at.

817
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:52,540
And so like you can actually go there 
and sit in an extra of Obama there.

818
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:53,943
Oh Wow.
So they took the actual bus and put it 

819
00:33:56,651 --> 00:33:58,450
in a museum.
Well that's it.

820
00:33:58,451 --> 00:33:59,284
Up in the above.
Someone should make a tour bus out of 

821
00:34:00,761 --> 00:34:03,310
that,
I think outkast or something.

822
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,350
You're talking about the band outcast.
Yeah.

823
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,490
I think it might be better in a museum.
Yeah,

824
00:34:12,491 --> 00:34:13,324
I guess.
But it's not a thing to have in a 

825
00:34:15,671 --> 00:34:16,570
museum,
I guess it is.

826
00:34:16,571 --> 00:34:19,180
Right.
It's like when do you decide what,

827
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,490
have you ever gone to one of those old 
West museums?

828
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:25,590
I went to an old West Museum in Montana.
It's pretty interesting where with city?

829
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:26,553
Uh,
Bozeman.

830
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,260
Yeah,
I know Bozeman beaut.

831
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:29,680
Billings.
Yeah.

832
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,900
I know the whole tour up there.
Pretty awesome.

833
00:34:31,901 --> 00:34:32,734
A museum.
But one of the interesting things about 

834
00:34:34,121 --> 00:34:34,954
it was they had these old stage coaches 
and just have to imagine taking one of 

835
00:34:39,431 --> 00:34:41,410
those fucking goofy things.
Cross the country.

836
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:44,920
Not that long ago.
That was long ago.

837
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,150
That's the thing.
I think that's tricky.

838
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:50,140
My horses.
That's the theme of this podcast.

839
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:51,490
Yeah.
Not that long ago.

840
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,890
Well,
it's really not that long ago.

841
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,320
When you eat,
you get older and you realize,

842
00:34:56,321 --> 00:34:58,230
oh,
I'm almost 50 right.

843
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,370
It's half a hundred years.
The wild west,

844
00:35:00,371 --> 00:35:03,250
shit that was 200 years ago,
200 years ago,

845
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,250
less than two wild west is less than 200
years ago.

846
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:08,200
Sure.
It's post civil war,

847
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,063
so it's like,

848
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:10,290
okay.

849
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:11,640
Yeah,
150 years.

850
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,533
Yeah.
Well I mean when people first started 

851
00:35:13,891 --> 00:35:15,210
coming,
like what year was it?

852
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,373
I think the wild west is like the 18th 
seventies 1865 is when slavery was 

853
00:35:21,751 --> 00:35:23,250
abolished.
That's,

854
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:26,280
is that the end of the wild west gun?
That's the start of it.

855
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:28,860
No,
1865 when,

856
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:32,340
well before that there were still 
traveling across the country like,

857
00:35:32,341 --> 00:35:32,770
well,
yeah,

858
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:34,950
the milestone,
they delete the [inaudible] and all that

859
00:35:34,951 --> 00:35:37,740
jazz.
I still feel like that's a all of that,

860
00:35:37,741 --> 00:35:38,574
but I might be wrong.
I might be wrong because the 40 niners 

861
00:35:41,161 --> 00:35:44,340
that's 1849 they're searching for gold 
in California.

862
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:45,203
So people are obviously trekking across 
the country looking for gold in 1849 we 

863
00:35:49,831 --> 00:35:51,900
know that nine or 49 ers.
Yeah.

864
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:53,520
Right.
And you know that we know.

865
00:35:53,521 --> 00:35:57,410
So maybe,
maybe 1850s and when would they be?

866
00:35:57,411 --> 00:36:00,810
1850s what was the donner party?
How is that the family,

867
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,100
each other.
Oh,

868
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,340
they got stuck in the mountain and that 
pass.

869
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:07,270
Whew.
That was that.

870
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:09,180
That is a,
that's intense.

871
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:11,670
Trying to get over the fucking rocky 
mountain in the winter.

872
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,920
Not Good.
Yeah.

873
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:15,580
Yeah.
It's even,

874
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:16,453
it's like,
it would be like trying to do it with 

875
00:36:17,371 --> 00:36:18,204
the hybrid.

876
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:21,910
Right?
Because those things don't have a lot.

877
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:23,760
Yeah.
Test.

878
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,590
Yeah.
The Donner party was a,

879
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:29,520
what does that say?
1846 yeah.

880
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,010
Okay.
So we got them right here.

881
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:36,500
I was wrong about the wild west.
I guess it's 1840s still again.

882
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:41,970
Lewis and Clark was around 1804 so 
around 1820s is 1820s okay.

883
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:42,903
All right.
I'm wrong.

884
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:43,823
I'm wrong.
So it's essentially almost exactly 280 

885
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:47,100
right.
You were right.

886
00:36:47,101 --> 00:36:47,934
So fucking recent though,
that's so damn reason to think that 200 

887
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:54,600
years ago there was no Chicago,
like as we know it,

888
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,970
giant buildings and airplanes.
No,

889
00:36:56,971 --> 00:36:59,760
San Francisco as we know it.
No New York City as we know it,

890
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,330
when New York City was kind of like 
pretty much cosmopolitan,

891
00:37:03,331 --> 00:37:04,164
but they,
they definitely had like buildings and 

892
00:37:05,161 --> 00:37:09,090
stuff cause there's some buildings from 
the 18 hundreds in a lot of spots,

893
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,253
but this,
this entire country go back 200 years 

894
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:18,420
and it's not much here.
That's a,

895
00:37:18,421 --> 00:37:20,130
that's strange.
Really.

896
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,053
Yeah.
I,

897
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:25,860
I'm more think it's beautiful and 
fascinate that too.

898
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,420
Yeah.
I just think it's incredible.

899
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:29,040
They're not mutually exclusive.
Wayne Fetterman.

900
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:30,780
Oh,
correct.

901
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:32,250
Correct.
It's not the opposite.

902
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,690
Could be both things.
Right.

903
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:34,830
It's all the above.

904
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,310
Yeah.
There is that.

905
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,520
Now this country is,
you know,

906
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:43,530
I'm a big 4th of July is my favorite 
holiday,

907
00:37:43,531 --> 00:37:44,364
by the way.
Are you a big patriot or are you just 

908
00:37:46,891 --> 00:37:48,960
like fireworks?
I love fireworks.

909
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,970
I even got him one of my favorite 
fireworks.

910
00:37:50,971 --> 00:37:53,190
It's just the one that flashes and makes
the sound.

911
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,630
Yeah.
You know that one.

912
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:54,991
Yeah,
I know.

913
00:37:54,991 --> 00:37:55,824
That way.
I don't really let their call to go to 

914
00:37:58,501 --> 00:38:00,710
Disneyland and stayed to the very end.
I would.

915
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:01,890
I would.
I would.

916
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,150
Yeah.
I just,

917
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:04,103
I love the whole thing.
I love the idea of this country who 

918
00:38:06,001 --> 00:38:08,310
liked me too,
like what we went through.

919
00:38:08,311 --> 00:38:10,080
I don't know.
Patriot is the word,

920
00:38:10,081 --> 00:38:11,310
but I get mad.
I just,

921
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:14,910
I would say I'm very appreciative of 
being lucky enough to live here.

922
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:15,960
Yeah.
Me Too.

923
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,840
We're lucky as fuck.
I especially think that when I travel,

924
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,610
whenever we go to other countries,
yeah.

925
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:21,763
And Go,
hmm.

926
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:23,003
You know,
I was talking to this gentleman in 

927
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:25,710
Italy.
I was in Italy a couple of weeks ago,

928
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:26,643
right.
And it was talking to this guy about he 

929
00:38:28,561 --> 00:38:31,050
wants to move to northern California.
He wants,

930
00:38:31,051 --> 00:38:34,590
he wanted to move to a San Jose and he 
has this idea,

931
00:38:34,591 --> 00:38:37,720
this is dream to take his kids and moved
to San Jose.

932
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,220
And uh,
you know,

933
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:44,280
it was kind of interesting talking to 
him about it and then it got kind of sad

934
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,750
because he was talking about his 
children.

935
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,730
He's like,
there's where he lives.

936
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:51,280
There's no hope,
there's no future,

937
00:38:51,281 --> 00:38:53,710
there's,
there's nothing to plan for,

938
00:38:53,711 --> 00:38:55,720
there's no opportunities.
And he's like,

939
00:38:55,721 --> 00:38:56,554
I really feel like my children would 
have an opportunity to succeed if they 

940
00:38:59,501 --> 00:39:00,640
could go,
go to America.

941
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:01,781
And I was like,
wow.

942
00:39:01,781 --> 00:39:02,614
That,
I mean that is what led my grandparents 

943
00:39:03,911 --> 00:39:05,320
to come here.
Yeah.

944
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,200
Why did they come from Italy?
Wow.

945
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:10,380
So that's your most of them.
My grandfather,

946
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:13,030
my father's side came from Ireland.
Everybody else,

947
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,090
my grandmother and my father saw,
and my grandmother and grandfather on my

948
00:39:16,091 --> 00:39:17,800
mother's side came from Italy.
All of them.

949
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,500
And not easy for the Italians and the 
Irish when they got here.

950
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,440
No,
no,

951
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:22,303
no news.
It one of those stories where they pass 

952
00:39:24,191 --> 00:39:26,380
down to you or were you just saying,
oh yeah,

953
00:39:26,381 --> 00:39:27,220
absolutely.
Yeah.

954
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,610
And they were there and they were all 
circus performers,

955
00:39:30,611 --> 00:39:33,150
right?
No,

956
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:34,030
no,
they were,

957
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:36,070
they were a wild pasta hunters.

958
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:43,750
My grandfather grew up road farm was 
rogue.

959
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,700
Yeah,
same thing.

960
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:46,990
Same thing.
Same thing.

961
00:39:46,991 --> 00:39:48,340
Now I feel very,
very,

962
00:39:48,341 --> 00:39:51,550
very fortunate and love it.
Yeah.

963
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:52,990
Yeah.
We're well,

964
00:39:52,991 --> 00:39:55,720
when you go to other countries then you 
really kind of get a sense of,

965
00:39:55,721 --> 00:39:59,680
first of all how recent this experiment 
in self government really is.

966
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:00,911
Cause a,
you know,

967
00:40:00,911 --> 00:40:01,744
when we were in Italy we were,
I took some photos at the Vatican and I 

968
00:40:04,961 --> 00:40:05,794
posted them up on my instagram the other
day and one of them that was probably 

969
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:12,190
not maybe the most impressive but the 
most put things into perspective.

970
00:40:12,191 --> 00:40:13,024
There's a floor of the Vatican where 
they have the statue of Hercules and 

971
00:40:16,391 --> 00:40:21,040
this tile mosaic floor is 1700 years old
and people walk on it.

972
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:22,083
Thousands of people walk in this mosaic 
tile and it's 1700 years old and it's 

973
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:28,174
just a tile for,
I mean it's just one thing of in this 

974
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:33,760
insane there.

975
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,640
That's the floor right there that at 
1700 years old,

976
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:40,540
and that's one tiny aspect of the 
Vatican.

977
00:40:40,541 --> 00:40:45,340
The Vatican is so monstrously huge and 
incredible.

978
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,640
It is one of the most breathtaking 
things I've ever seen in my life.

979
00:40:48,641 --> 00:40:53,350
And the accomplishment of people from 
hundreds and hundreds of years ago.

980
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:55,830
They put together this building,
I even called them artisans.

981
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:56,950
He,
you know,

982
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:59,320
I guess humans.
Humans.

983
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:02,440
Yeah.
With the human beings can do is pain.

984
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:05,860
I'd be just along design,
it's not quite as breathtaking is that,

985
00:41:05,861 --> 00:41:10,861
but just this morning someone posted 
Steve Jobs announcement of the Imac when

986
00:41:13,421 --> 00:41:17,530
that came out in the nineties late 
nineties and just,

987
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:20,410
and then all the comments from the kids 
who were just like,

988
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,273
oh,
it would blow their minds if they knew 

989
00:41:24,251 --> 00:41:25,084
the computer.
I'm looking at this demonstration on 

990
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,470
you,
like just,

991
00:41:29,471 --> 00:41:31,360
that's how fast,
you know,

992
00:41:31,361 --> 00:41:32,620
everything changed.
Yeah.

993
00:41:32,621 --> 00:41:33,800
Yeah.
There it is.

994
00:41:33,801 --> 00:41:34,940
Yeah.
Look at jobs.

995
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,650
A big fat face.
And what is interesting,

996
00:41:36,651 --> 00:41:38,540
no room looking like that.
This is before,

997
00:41:38,541 --> 00:41:43,160
this is pre a tee shirt and jeans or 
turtleneck and jeans.

998
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,173
Yeah.
This is jobs with a button up shirt all 

999
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:48,730
the way up to the neck and a blazer and 
office.

1000
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:50,780
Ma'Am.
Yeah.

1001
00:41:50,781 --> 00:41:51,710
Hair.
He's got hair.

1002
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:56,950
But look how chubbies phases that poor 
guy worked himself to death,

1003
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,060
if I like that early.
Yeah.

1004
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,193
I feel like you read it.
Crushed his immune system with is an 

1005
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:06,530
intense pursuit of excellence.
I really,

1006
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:09,500
I really think that,
I think that was a big part of it.

1007
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:13,760
Did you read William Isaacson's?
Isaac?

1008
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:14,803
No.
I've read many accounts of people that 

1009
00:42:16,281 --> 00:42:17,114
worked with them,
but I've never read any biographies on 

1010
00:42:18,021 --> 00:42:18,880
him.
But uh,

1011
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:19,813
you know,
I,

1012
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,550
I'm fascinated to it like that to 
cautionary tale.

1013
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:23,420
Yes,
you do.

1014
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,230
Yeah,
I do.

1015
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:25,160
I mean,
I think there's,

1016
00:42:25,161 --> 00:42:25,994
um,
there's a balance to be achieved and in 

1017
00:42:28,401 --> 00:42:29,234
life and I don't,
I don't necessarily think he achieved 

1018
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:31,460
balance.

1019
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:32,293
I think he burned it.
I think he went crazy and did the best 

1020
00:42:35,541 --> 00:42:38,150
to make an incredible stuff and an 
amazing company.

1021
00:42:38,151 --> 00:42:38,984
That's probably one of the most 
innovative and influential companies in 

1022
00:42:41,841 --> 00:42:44,270
the history of technology.
No question,

1023
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,310
if not the right.
Probably the,

1024
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:48,350
and it's a big part of it was his 
vision.

1025
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,910
Right?
What the,

1026
00:42:49,911 --> 00:42:54,140
to me the most amazing of all the things
he did were,

1027
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:59,170
what is those stores like Tim,
in my mind,

1028
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,650
I can't even imagine at a time.
And everyone was like,

1029
00:43:03,651 --> 00:43:05,930
brick and mortar is gone.
Everything is online.

1030
00:43:05,931 --> 00:43:06,980
Our Co,
our liberty,

1031
00:43:06,981 --> 00:43:11,300
our company is about online.
It gets I is Internet.

1032
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:13,460
That's what I phone I Mac.
Right.

1033
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:17,570
That's what it's about.
And that he had the vision to go,

1034
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:19,850
you know,
I think it needs a store.

1035
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:22,310
Yeah.
A store like,

1036
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:23,573
well,
you pay rent and you have insurance and 

1037
00:43:24,921 --> 00:43:28,610
all of these other overhead costs that 
Amazon doesn't deal with.

1038
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:29,443
Well here's this.
Even better windows tend to copy them 

1039
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:34,640
and they don't sell computers.
Oh,

1040
00:43:34,641 --> 00:43:36,290
the,
the Michael's stores.

1041
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:37,580
Microsoft stores.
You mean?

1042
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:39,660
I think they call them window stores,
don't they?

1043
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,870
Well anyway,
you go to them.

1044
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:43,790
Yeah.
They don't sell computers.

1045
00:43:43,791 --> 00:43:44,624
They sell,
they're just the software computers out 

1046
00:43:45,861 --> 00:43:46,490
there and you go,
oh,

1047
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:47,570
can I buy this?
Nope.

1048
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:51,970
Like what the fuck are you selling next 
level,

1049
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,133
next level marketing go.
And like you can go and like this 

1050
00:43:56,781 --> 00:43:57,614
laptop,
you can go to an apple store and you 

1051
00:43:59,061 --> 00:43:59,751
could say,
hey,

1052
00:43:59,751 --> 00:44:02,930
I want a retina 15 inch and blah,
blah,

1053
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:03,980
blah.
And they'll go,

1054
00:44:03,981 --> 00:44:05,240
okay,
let me see if we have it in stock.

1055
00:44:05,241 --> 00:44:05,901
Yes,
we do.

1056
00:44:05,901 --> 00:44:07,580
Come on over here.
Credit card.

1057
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:09,200
Would you like your receipt emailed to 
you?

1058
00:44:09,201 --> 00:44:10,040
Yes,
I would.

1059
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:11,510
Whoa.
Do I have to stand in line?

1060
00:44:11,511 --> 00:44:12,700
No,
we just didn't rate him.

1061
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,860
Then he'd get out of there and you walk 
and you got a computer.

1062
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:19,940
There's no other store like that other 
than like you go to best buy and you can

1063
00:44:19,941 --> 00:44:24,941
buy an oh an apple or windows computer.
Microsoft stores will have giveaways,

1064
00:44:25,461 --> 00:44:28,040
special events,
and no computers.

1065
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:31,603
They have anything.
They're like showcases for what they 

1066
00:44:34,081 --> 00:44:37,560
sell,
which is the windows.

1067
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:39,240
I mean,
maybe they sell windows.

1068
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:41,070
Let's find out.
Jamie,

1069
00:44:41,071 --> 00:44:43,550
what the fuck do they sell?
I just went in one the other day.

1070
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:46,290
Well,
let me guess the one you went into.

1071
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,570
Century city.
I was in Ohio,

1072
00:44:48,571 --> 00:44:49,770
actually.
Jesus,

1073
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:50,963
way off.
Give a fuck it a lot stuff was a lot of 

1074
00:44:53,311 --> 00:44:54,210
the stuff,
they're selling cars.

1075
00:44:54,211 --> 00:44:56,820
They sell x boxes is a product Mike.
Oh,

1076
00:44:56,821 --> 00:44:58,830
okay.
So they sell games,

1077
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:00,570
the,
a lot of games and things like that.

1078
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:04,140
Now what about word Microsoft word?
Isn't that,

1079
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:05,610
isn't that a program?
There's,

1080
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:07,500
yes.
What's this spreadsheet?

1081
00:45:07,501 --> 00:45:08,490
What's a,
what's that called?

1082
00:45:08,491 --> 00:45:09,600
Power Point.
Power,

1083
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:10,643
right.
They did have a little office suite and 

1084
00:45:12,061 --> 00:45:15,180
a section of a smaller day,
but they sell a lot of those.

1085
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:16,950
They sell a lot of it.
So he sell some software.

1086
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:17,813
Yeah.
But it's just a little card to download 

1087
00:45:18,721 --> 00:45:19,410
it.
Yeah.

1088
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:21,390
Everything gets downloaded now.
Yeah.

1089
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,340
Yeah.
Interesting.

1090
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:24,563
No,
I mean obviously they just panicked and 

1091
00:45:25,951 --> 00:45:26,581
we're like,
okay,

1092
00:45:26,581 --> 00:45:31,320
I guess we have to have some presence in
these malls.

1093
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:33,300
We have these apple stores are,
well,

1094
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:36,210
windows computers are pretty fucking 
good now.

1095
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:39,210
And they had our touchscreen.
A lot of them have touchscreen,

1096
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:41,670
right?
Like I was at a a one of those best buys

1097
00:45:41,671 --> 00:45:43,110
or whatever the fuck it was the other 
day.

1098
00:45:43,111 --> 00:45:44,880
And I was checking out the windows 
computers.

1099
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:46,380
I was like,
it's Kinda interesting.

1100
00:45:46,381 --> 00:45:48,630
Like you could touch the screen,
would you jump?

1101
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:54,850
Give a fuck?
But windows have many more,

1102
00:45:54,851 --> 00:45:56,440
um,
problems with viruses.

1103
00:45:57,110 --> 00:45:58,540
They're,
they're way more vulnerable.

1104
00:45:58,570 --> 00:45:59,403
Right.
And there's also compatibility issues 

1105
00:46:01,330 --> 00:46:03,100
because,
excuse me,

1106
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:04,730
one of the things that,
um,

1107
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:07,960
apple's done brilliantly is integrate 
all the parts.

1108
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:10,960
So the fact that you have the exact same
video card is everybody else,

1109
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:13,780
you have the exact same motherboard.
Everything works together.

1110
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:15,370
Everything works seamlessly.
The,

1111
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:16,473
the problem with windows is what 
[inaudible] is going to do is going to 

1112
00:46:19,661 --> 00:46:21,630
be different than with,
you know,

1113
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:22,583
Dell's going to do,
which is going to be different than 

1114
00:46:24,371 --> 00:46:25,204
what,
and then you have to have all the 

1115
00:46:26,231 --> 00:46:27,064
drivers in order.
And then I see different companies put 

1116
00:46:30,011 --> 00:46:33,070
their own proprietary stuff on there.
And then there's also,

1117
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:35,020
there's a,
there's more ways,

1118
00:46:35,021 --> 00:46:35,854
and obviously I'm not a computer expert,
but there's more ways to explore the 

1119
00:46:38,231 --> 00:46:41,410
windows operating system apparently than
there is to exploit apple.

1120
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:44,910
As far as like innovating or no,
no,

1121
00:46:44,911 --> 00:46:45,744
no,
it's fine.

1122
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:46,570
Oh,
okay.

1123
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:47,021
Yeah.
I mean,

1124
00:46:47,021 --> 00:46:49,270
how many viruses have been,
I mean,

1125
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:52,060
the number of computer viruses alone.
Oh,

1126
00:46:52,061 --> 00:46:53,440
that's a thing I was watching the other 
day.

1127
00:46:53,441 --> 00:46:57,550
I was watching a documentary around 
stuxnet and on how they,

1128
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:58,473
they concocted this,
a computer virus to attack the Iranian 

1129
00:47:02,501 --> 00:47:02,930
news.

1130
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:04,190
Oh,
I know all about this.

1131
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:04,940
Ooh,
do you?

1132
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:05,850
Oh yeah,
yeah,

1133
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:06,510
yeah,
yeah.

1134
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:09,020
I mean obviously I didn't recognize that
name,

1135
00:47:09,021 --> 00:47:11,840
but there's,
that documentary is out now.

1136
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:13,130
Yes.
Where did you see it?

1137
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:15,890
In the hotel room?
Hotel Room in Atlanta.

1138
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:17,150
Yeah.
Cause there's a book,

1139
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:19,130
there's a book about it now when it's 
just like,

1140
00:47:19,131 --> 00:47:24,131
that's scary because now you can ruin 
machines with computer virus.

1141
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:25,850
Yeah,
correct.

1142
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:29,080
Yes.
You can or launch a missile or do a,

1143
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:31,780
we'll shut down the power grid or do a 
lot of different things.

1144
00:47:31,781 --> 00:47:33,000
Yeah.
It was,

1145
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:37,360
it's crazy what they did.
And they relate to the United States and

1146
00:47:37,361 --> 00:47:39,010
Israel if I'm not mistaken.
Yup.

1147
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,470
Apparently.
Um,

1148
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:42,080
I delwin stalking about it.
Yeah.

1149
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:44,410
How did they get people to talk?
But how did they do it?

1150
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:46,420
Well,
the people in the documentary,

1151
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,740
they were not real people.
They were,

1152
00:47:48,741 --> 00:47:49,574
uh,
like a sort of a CGI version of a 

1153
00:47:52,331 --> 00:47:52,930
person.

1154
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:56,020
They used to talk and their voice was 
all scrambled and,

1155
00:47:56,021 --> 00:47:56,854
but they were talking about the 
developmental process and all the 

1156
00:47:58,871 --> 00:48:00,010
people,
which is interesting.

1157
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,500
They were saying that all the people 
that work at the NSA.

1158
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:03,420
Yup.
Um,

1159
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:04,840
there,
there's two types of people.

1160
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:05,863
Uh,
there's like military type people and 

1161
00:48:07,631 --> 00:48:08,464
then there's like super nerds.
There's like people with like one guy 

1162
00:48:10,871 --> 00:48:11,704
had,
they were saying had a death star that 

1163
00:48:13,241 --> 00:48:18,090
he built out of Legos that sat on his 
desk and like they had verizon.

1164
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:19,373
Yeah,
I'm very a mark and they had various 

1165
00:48:24,041 --> 00:48:26,560
like superhero dolls,
like laying around stuff.

1166
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:30,220
They were like comicon type folks.
And um,

1167
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:31,503
it was uh,
interesting that there were sort of 

1168
00:48:33,131 --> 00:48:33,964
describing the environment of working 
there that is these sort of a computer 

1169
00:48:38,201 --> 00:48:39,034
folks and super nerds,
super a computer geeked out wizards who 

1170
00:48:44,141 --> 00:48:44,974
are working together with these military
characters and the military characters 

1171
00:48:47,861 --> 00:48:52,861
are sort of guiding them to try to 
create these viruses to attack these,

1172
00:48:53,381 --> 00:48:55,630
um,
various facilities that I ran had.

1173
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:58,660
Okay.
So let's say again,

1174
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:00,640
Delwin goes on the record about this 
thing.

1175
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:03,820
Let's say this actually happened.
Let's assume it did.

1176
00:49:04,090 --> 00:49:07,720
Um,
that was built at the NSA.

1177
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:10,270
I thought that was just about 
eavesdropping.

1178
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,130
Stuxnet.
Yeah,

1179
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:16,150
the computer virus was built there.
Someone can cocked it.

1180
00:49:16,151 --> 00:49:18,400
I don't think,
I don't think they ever admitted or know

1181
00:49:18,401 --> 00:49:21,230
for sure where right now find out jamie 
put up,

1182
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:23,200
see what I,
yeah,

1183
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:24,063
cause I know I understood that it was 
Israel and the United States and that's 

1184
00:49:27,761 --> 00:49:31,330
how they shut down.
They grinded that centrifuge.

1185
00:49:31,331 --> 00:49:32,200
They,
yes.

1186
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:33,093
They undermine the centrifuge and in 
Iran and I think even that is a little 

1187
00:49:37,691 --> 00:49:38,524
bit speculation.
I don't think that's been 100% 

1188
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:42,603
documented.
We actually did it or where that Israel 

1189
00:49:45,191 --> 00:49:46,980
was involved or both.
I don't,

1190
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:49,420
I don't,
I don't know if it's 100% documented.

1191
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:50,171
Yeah,
we,

1192
00:49:50,171 --> 00:49:51,370
yeah.
No one goes on the record.

1193
00:49:51,370 --> 00:49:52,203
I don't know.
That's why I was asking who was talking 

1194
00:49:54,221 --> 00:49:55,270
in this document.
Yeah.

1195
00:49:55,271 --> 00:49:56,650
I didn't watch the whole documentary 
either.

1196
00:49:56,651 --> 00:49:59,440
I've watched the about 40 minutes.
I'm like I get get the point here.

1197
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:01,560
And then you went back to game of 
thrones with the,

1198
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:04,960
I don't think those breaths.
I don't know what I did.

1199
00:50:04,961 --> 00:50:07,330
I think I was leaving.
I think it was just watching it before I

1200
00:50:07,331 --> 00:50:09,270
had to leave.
I'm a documentary nut.

1201
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:10,680
Hmm.
Love Him.

1202
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:12,460
What have you seen recently?
That's awesome.

1203
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,050
Tickled.
Oh,

1204
00:50:14,051 --> 00:50:15,070
you into that,
huh?

1205
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:17,950
Jamie tried to get me to watch that,
so I'll take off.

1206
00:50:17,951 --> 00:50:19,810
There's a lot of people that were 
thinking that it was fake.

1207
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,370
Yeah.
It looks vague.

1208
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:22,640
At the beginning I was like,
I didn't.

1209
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:23,231
Yeah,
no,

1210
00:50:23,231 --> 00:50:24,850
it's for real ties.
Saw tickled.

1211
00:50:24,851 --> 00:50:28,400
I saw the Brian Depalma documentary.
I saw wiener.

1212
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:29,750
Did you see that?
What's that?

1213
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:33,050
It's about Anthony Wiener,
the congressmen.

1214
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,450
What does that incredible.
Really,

1215
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:39,540
Joe highly recommended.
I'm not highly recommending Ted Gold.

1216
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,500
I'm highly recommending this.
What's so good about wiener?

1217
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:44,360
Okay.
You know what happened?

1218
00:50:44,361 --> 00:50:45,900
He had a sex scandal.
He was,

1219
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:48,030
you know,
site or things that steam,

1220
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:48,873
correct.
Yeah.

1221
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:51,860
It's all behind me.
I'm back with my wife,

1222
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:53,630
Huma.
I'm running.

1223
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:55,730
I've,
I've resigned from Congress.

1224
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:58,600
I'm running for mayor of New York.
I'm a New Yorker.

1225
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,680
That thing.
Hmm.

1226
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:03,260
His acts,
let me get this right.

1227
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:07,070
One of his top campaign aides wants to 
be a documentary filmmaker.

1228
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:09,800
It's like,
do you mind if I cover your campaign?

1229
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:10,701
It's like,
sure.

1230
00:51:10,701 --> 00:51:12,590
You know me,
I've worked with you before.

1231
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:14,250
You're loyal ix,
you know,

1232
00:51:14,370 --> 00:51:18,590
assistant during all these horrible 
scandal in Congress and all of that.

1233
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:20,570
I trust you.
So we ate,

1234
00:51:20,571 --> 00:51:24,200
brings this guy in Joe,
you know what's happening.

1235
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:29,600
And then in the mid and he's winning,
he's actually a head in one poll,

1236
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:31,123
the the mayor to win the mayorship if I 
don't know if maybe shipped the right 

1237
00:51:34,071 --> 00:51:34,904
word.
And then second sexting scandal breaks 

1238
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:44,530
while full access to him as it's 
happening inside Jesus.

1239
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:48,440
And at one point I'm not going to spoil 
anything.

1240
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,360
Well obviously you know what happened?
Oil The shit out of it.

1241
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:53,330
At one point he,
you hear the camera guy,

1242
00:51:53,331 --> 00:51:56,510
his buddy just go,
why are you letting me film this?

1243
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:05,820
Great.
Oh my God.

1244
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:07,230
You know,
off cameras is,

1245
00:52:07,231 --> 00:52:10,260
why are you letting me film this?
I assume he got a piece of it,

1246
00:52:10,261 --> 00:52:11,670
right?
What does it say?

1247
00:52:11,671 --> 00:52:14,370
Hilarious.
Like a spinal tap of politics.

1248
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,890
It's the full package mind blowing.
One of the most,

1249
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,500
one of the best documentaries ever made 
about a political scandal.

1250
00:52:19,501 --> 00:52:20,131
Fast,
funny,

1251
00:52:20,131 --> 00:52:23,010
insightful and outrageous politics that 
it's insane.

1252
00:52:23,011 --> 00:52:24,000
Best.
And,

1253
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:24,923
and he's a smart guy.
Wieners a super smart guy and his great 

1254
00:52:27,571 --> 00:52:29,310
advocated,
great liberal advocate.

1255
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:32,910
Then problem is like a lot of great 
people.

1256
00:52:32,911 --> 00:52:36,480
Yeah.
He has a bizarre sexual drive and you're

1257
00:52:36,481 --> 00:52:38,700
not allowed to express that if you're in
politics.

1258
00:52:38,701 --> 00:52:39,391
It's the one,
I mean,

1259
00:52:39,391 --> 00:52:43,140
if he was an actor or if he was a 
musician or a comic,

1260
00:52:43,141 --> 00:52:44,250
if he was one of us,
right,

1261
00:52:44,251 --> 00:52:45,840
you would have no problem.
He'd be like,

1262
00:52:45,841 --> 00:52:46,860
sorry,
I fucked up.

1263
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:48,540
I freak.
And they're like that add that if weird,

1264
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:50,010
pulling his dick out.

1265
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:51,363
Wow.

1266
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:52,573
Right.
Be psyched for his next Netflix special 

1267
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:57,590
where he would talk about it.
But unfortunately for him,

1268
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:58,424
he's in this bullshit world where you 
have to pretend you have to not 

1269
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:03,040
resetting sanctimonious about marriage.
Yeah.

1270
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:04,370
Well,
it's not just that.

1271
00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:05,480
Yeah.
Sanctimonious,

1272
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:06,640
say sacred.
Right?

1273
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:08,373
Yeah.
Um,

1274
00:53:08,570 --> 00:53:09,230
you will,
you,

1275
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:12,260
it's not just that it's also secret 
sent.

1276
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:13,580
Yes.
That's it.

1277
00:53:13,581 --> 00:53:14,414
Right.
I think so.

1278
00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:15,343
Sanctimonious is like you're talking 
down to people who are not doing what 

1279
00:53:18,831 --> 00:53:19,640
you're doing.
Right,

1280
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:20,473
right.
I think there's also the issue that we 

1281
00:53:22,851 --> 00:53:25,950
want someone who is a leader who

1282
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:29,520
we have very unrealistic expectations of
them as human beings.

1283
00:53:29,521 --> 00:53:30,354
We want them to be completely different 
than everyone we've ever met in our 

1284
00:53:33,271 --> 00:53:34,104
lives and lead us and lead us and also 
have the desire to be that one person 

1285
00:53:39,451 --> 00:53:40,284
that Alpha who,
and those guys like fucking Kennedy and 

1286
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:44,611
many,
many,

1287
00:53:44,611 --> 00:53:45,444
many other ones that I'm sure we don't 
know who was cheating on who or who is 

1288
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:50,820
doing those guys are always freaks.
Bill Clinton.

1289
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:53,010
They are always freaks.
Oh my God.

1290
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:54,570
That you know,
Steven crowder,

1291
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:56,310
Steven crowder made this,
uh,

1292
00:53:56,311 --> 00:54:00,390
this video about Hillary and the in and 
part of the video.

1293
00:54:00,391 --> 00:54:02,700
It was like all reasons why you 
shouldn't vote for Hillary Clinton.

1294
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:03,993
Um,
it's the different things that she's 

1295
00:54:05,491 --> 00:54:06,324
done to cover up the,
the different sexual scandals that her 

1296
00:54:08,581 --> 00:54:11,970
husband was involved in.
When you see the list of sexual scandals

1297
00:54:11,971 --> 00:54:12,990
and he was involved in,
it's like,

1298
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:13,853
oh my God,
and this is only the women that 

1299
00:54:16,081 --> 00:54:17,400
complained.
Of course.

1300
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:18,263
I mean,
it had to be a gang of gals that were 

1301
00:54:19,981 --> 00:54:21,360
paid off,
ride or die.

1302
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:23,100
They kept their mouth shut.
They knew how to hang.

1303
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:25,903
Oh,
I see.

1304
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:26,973
I see what your land with that.
Of course it's gotta be one of those 

1305
00:54:31,361 --> 00:54:35,800
gals that you know wanted to out him for
all the dirtiness.

1306
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,740
That's the kind of guy that wants to be 
president.

1307
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:42,290
That's the kind of guy there.
They're always Dick slingers wa.

1308
00:54:42,430 --> 00:54:43,263
Yeah,
and Anthony does kind of address that a 

1309
00:54:45,491 --> 00:54:46,324
little bit.
Jenny,

1310
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,610
a little bit.
He talks about at once,

1311
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,800
once it broke,
God,

1312
00:54:50,801 --> 00:54:53,020
there's Joe,
there's a scene in there where he's,

1313
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:56,590
you can see he's in the car and his 
assistant is like,

1314
00:54:56,650 --> 00:54:58,800
what do we say?
Did this happen just once?

1315
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,910
Did this just happen?
And he's like trying to figure out,

1316
00:55:00,911 --> 00:55:01,650
you know her,
he,

1317
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:04,840
his press secretary or,
and he's,

1318
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:06,513
you can hear in his head replaying 
interviews he's given before where he 

1319
00:55:10,601 --> 00:55:12,250
lied and I'm like,
oh,

1320
00:55:12,251 --> 00:55:14,600
I shouldn't have said that to the New 
Yorker Guy.

1321
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:16,900
It just,
yeah,

1322
00:55:16,901 --> 00:55:19,120
it's just all crump camera.
Right.

1323
00:55:19,330 --> 00:55:21,970
What does that guy do now?
He's,

1324
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:25,780
he's the husband of whom hill?
Yeah.

1325
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:29,980
Hillary's one of her top advisors.
He's going to be very close to the White

1326
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:32,000
House if trends continue.
I'm at,

1327
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:33,370
I'm not a predictor.
I'm not,

1328
00:55:33,490 --> 00:55:34,323
do you think Hillary?
Hillary probably comforted Houma cause 

1329
00:55:37,271 --> 00:55:38,770
she's used to this shit.
She was like,

1330
00:55:38,771 --> 00:55:40,630
listen,
you can tell you about dudes.

1331
00:55:41,590 --> 00:55:42,423
She probably went down on her,
but that I don't that comfort that I 

1332
00:55:47,531 --> 00:55:48,880
don't know.
But that's what I heard.

1333
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:49,840
If you go really?
Okay.

1334
00:55:49,841 --> 00:55:54,490
I heard them on fortune.
Okay.

1335
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:57,490
Um,
yeah,

1336
00:55:57,491 --> 00:55:58,324
so that's a documentary I would 
recommend of the ones I've seen 

1337
00:56:01,211 --> 00:56:02,590
recently.
MMM.

1338
00:56:03,070 --> 00:56:05,800
But I love them all down.
I don't love them all,

1339
00:56:05,801 --> 00:56:08,110
but I,
I really liked the genre.

1340
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:09,393
Yeah.
I'm a big fan of documentaries to give 

1341
00:56:10,571 --> 00:56:11,930
me a couple of your favorite,
um,

1342
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:15,670
merchants of doubt and I've seen that.
Oh yes.

1343
00:56:15,671 --> 00:56:19,340
That is about the cigarette companies 
and then the will,

1344
00:56:19,341 --> 00:56:23,100
the same guys are now global warming.
Yeah.

1345
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:24,190
Well explain

1346
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:25,900
to folks at home what we're talking 
about.

1347
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:26,973
The same.
The the cigarette companies hire these 

1348
00:56:28,571 --> 00:56:29,404
folks to go on all these different talk 
shows like those talking head split 

1349
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:34,813
screen shows and like cnn where someone 
would say cigarettes have been shown to 

1350
00:56:38,711 --> 00:56:40,150
cause cancer.
This is a lie.

1351
00:56:40,151 --> 00:56:43,180
This is a patented lie.
Cigarettes are not addictive.

1352
00:56:43,181 --> 00:56:44,014
They don't cause cancer.
It still just don't to white guy and 

1353
00:56:47,290 --> 00:56:48,123
these guys would go on all these 
different shows and they would throw 

1354
00:56:52,481 --> 00:56:53,314
doubt into the whatever the narrative 
was that the FDA or whoever was trying 

1355
00:56:58,151 --> 00:57:02,530
to say that cigarettes were bad for you.
The same exact guys,

1356
00:57:02,531 --> 00:57:05,320
not the same tactics but the same human 
beings.

1357
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,660
Same dudes.
Same exact guys.

1358
00:57:07,810 --> 00:57:08,643
Same exact guys.
It wasn't from the 50s it was from the 

1359
00:57:10,810 --> 00:57:11,643
70s the seventh same exact guys went on.
A wows actually wouldn't when the 

1360
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:19,720
lawsuits were going on,
it might've been the 80s anyway,

1361
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:20,673
same exact guys were then shilling for 
global warming a couple decades later I 

1362
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:28,240
anti global warming,
anti global warning.

1363
00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:30,460
They were doing the exact same thing as 
documentary.

1364
00:57:30,461 --> 00:57:31,840
It's great.
It's great.

1365
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:32,920
Yeah,
it's stunning.

1366
00:57:32,921 --> 00:57:34,570
So wiener level,
I don't know.

1367
00:57:34,571 --> 00:57:38,740
I haven't seen wiener.
I'd have to see wiener wiener would make

1368
00:57:38,741 --> 00:57:40,120
me cringe.
Yeah,

1369
00:57:40,121 --> 00:57:43,360
it is.
I mean it's,

1370
00:57:43,570 --> 00:57:45,830
it's so human is the word I would use.
Yeah.

1371
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,870
Well,
Human Houma,

1372
00:57:48,730 --> 00:57:49,563
you can't be human in that world.
That's a world that doesn't allow human 

1373
00:57:52,271 --> 00:57:54,940
behavior.
He was John Stewart roommate.

1374
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:55,983
Waze.
Yeah,

1375
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:58,390
one of the like in college or something 
or right after.

1376
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:01,510
But he's a great speaker.
He,

1377
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:05,530
and he did some speeches before the 
first scandal.

1378
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,950
He had some speeches on the,
uh,

1379
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:10,150
the floor of the Senate.
And uh,

1380
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:12,160
I remember listening to him going,
wow,

1381
00:58:12,161 --> 00:58:14,920
this guy is going to be a force in 
politics.

1382
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:15,783
He's passionate,
he's intelligent and he knows how to 

1383
00:58:17,711 --> 00:58:19,150
write.
She's good at framing.

1384
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:20,141
Yeah.
Yeah.

1385
00:58:20,141 --> 00:58:21,010
He's righteous.

1386
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:23,560
Yeah.
That's what I was saying of unbelievable

1387
00:58:23,561 --> 00:58:24,394
advocate.
There's also another scene in the movie 

1388
00:58:26,051 --> 00:58:28,330
where Kinda can't think of the guy on 
that.

1389
00:58:28,331 --> 00:58:30,550
Do you follow Msnbc at all?
No.

1390
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:34,060
All right.
One of their talking heads has him on,

1391
00:58:34,061 --> 00:58:37,210
and it's this,
it's almost like a meltdown interview,

1392
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:40,840
but it's,
you see the interview on television,

1393
00:58:40,841 --> 00:58:43,090
but also the video crew is there.
Like,

1394
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:46,330
just seeing him alone.
You know what I mean?

1395
00:58:46,331 --> 00:58:47,164
When someone's doing a remote interview 
just alone and he kinda has this look 

1396
00:58:50,511 --> 00:58:54,790
like I'm crushing this,
so he's not really aware of how bad it's

1397
00:58:54,791 --> 00:58:56,110
going.
Wow.

1398
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:57,520
It's,
yeah.

1399
00:58:57,521 --> 00:58:58,750
All right.
If you're into that at all,

1400
00:58:58,751 --> 00:58:59,770
I'll see it.
Yeah.

1401
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:00,663
You know what's interesting to me is 
that the same time what he was 

1402
00:59:02,741 --> 00:59:04,030
experiencing,
his meltdown,

1403
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:04,893
Charlie Sheen was rising like a phoenix 
from the ashes talking about doing blow 

1404
00:59:08,501 --> 00:59:11,200
and bang and hookers and saying,
you don't pay them for sex.

1405
00:59:11,201 --> 00:59:12,810
He pay him to leave.
And everybody's like,

1406
00:59:12,830 --> 00:59:14,840
go charlie,
tiger blood.

1407
00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:15,683
It's your point and your point you're 
making exactly like there's that'll the 

1408
00:59:19,091 --> 00:59:22,280
latitude of that kind of stuff.
What's interesting to me

1409
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:25,190
is that we've sort of crossed the 
divide.

1410
00:59:25,450 --> 00:59:26,283
Donald Trump and Donald Trump is allowed
to kind of do whatever the fuck you 

1411
00:59:29,241 --> 00:59:30,770
want.
You know?

1412
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:35,210
And especially when he's competing 
against Hillary Clinton who's been shown

1413
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:38,870
time and time again to be a fucking 
complete liar.

1414
00:59:39,050 --> 00:59:41,420
She's just an absolute liar,
right?

1415
00:59:41,570 --> 00:59:44,720
On a grand scale,
like not just little lies,

1416
00:59:44,721 --> 00:59:48,380
but lies about all sorts of things,
like the origins of her name,

1417
00:59:48,381 --> 00:59:50,480
who she was named after.
Like she's,

1418
00:59:50,481 --> 00:59:54,130
she's a crazy person and she's a 
politician and like in an,

1419
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:57,590
in,
in a sober way re bizarre character.

1420
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:01,670
So when a guy like Donald Trump is 
competing against her,

1421
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:03,230
like,
and you know,

1422
01:00:03,231 --> 01:00:06,650
it starts naming her crooked hillary,
like someone,

1423
01:00:06,651 --> 01:00:07,484
someone tried to get some traction by 
calling Donald Trump a womanizer and 

1424
01:00:10,401 --> 01:00:11,150
saying that,
you know,

1425
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:13,550
he's a,
and people don't care who cames a fuck.

1426
01:00:13,551 --> 01:00:14,900
Of course he is looking at me.

1427
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:18,320
He's a billionaire with a super hot wife
who did lesbian porn,

1428
01:00:18,321 --> 01:00:19,310
by the way.
Do you see that?

1429
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:22,140
I don't lack a lot of porn.
Tell me about it.

1430
01:00:22,141 --> 01:00:24,140
In New York,
Daily News took a,

1431
01:00:24,350 --> 01:00:26,160
that some cover,
uh,

1432
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:27,073
the,
some photos that they put on the cover 

1433
01:00:29,090 --> 01:00:31,160
yesterday and uh,
it was,

1434
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:33,410
was the say Melania,
how'd he say it?

1435
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:38,920
Well on it with a bow.
Okay.

1436
01:00:39,290 --> 01:00:42,380
Yeah.
Chuck Pal's a Wowza like,

1437
01:00:42,381 --> 01:00:45,680
come on,
that is not just the hottest first lady,

1438
01:00:45,770 --> 01:00:48,920
potential first lady ever.
But off the charts.

1439
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:50,053
It's like the difference Chine,
like who's the toughest fourth grader 

1440
01:00:53,091 --> 01:00:54,070
and Mike Tyson,
right?

1441
01:00:58,060 --> 01:01:01,100
I mean fucking crazy.
I mean this,

1442
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,640
this guy is going to be the fucking 
president.

1443
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:06,950
It's super pop.
It's super possible.

1444
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:07,873
It's not just 50 50 in my hand because I
think that as time goes on she looks 

1445
01:01:11,481 --> 01:01:14,840
worse and worse and the only thing that 
that saves her,

1446
01:01:14,990 --> 01:01:15,823
his,
his outrageousness and I think he hired 

1447
01:01:18,321 --> 01:01:21,440
that guy who has that political 
strategist that he hired that is um,

1448
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:23,630
I don't,
I do not remember his name.

1449
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:25,010
Paul Manafort.
Is that his name?

1450
01:01:26,210 --> 01:01:27,043
Chief chief of his campaign.
The most recent I that he hired about 

1451
01:01:30,441 --> 01:01:31,820
three months ago,
four months ago.

1452
01:01:31,970 --> 01:01:36,320
But the idea was that this guy is going 
to shape the new,

1453
01:01:36,321 --> 01:01:37,154
like the idea is like he's going to God,
he got the nomination now that he's got 

1454
01:01:39,891 --> 01:01:40,724
the nomination nomination secure.
Now you go after Hillary and you bring 

1455
01:01:43,281 --> 01:01:44,900
in all the people that are on the fence.

1456
01:01:45,050 --> 01:01:46,910
How do you do that?
You become more moderate.

1457
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:51,940
You become more,
less outrageous with your statements and

1458
01:01:52,251 --> 01:01:55,170
you try to point out the benefits of you
versus the,

1459
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:56,900
the problems with her.
Of course,

1460
01:01:57,770 --> 01:02:00,620
if he does that successfully,
do you think he has a chance?

1461
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:01,970
Yes,
100%.

1462
01:02:01,971 --> 01:02:03,470
He has a chance.
He's the fucking Republican.

1463
01:02:03,471 --> 01:02:04,640
Again,
he has a chance.

1464
01:02:04,670 --> 01:02:05,503
There's a lot of people that are just 
not going to vote for Hillary because 

1465
01:02:07,041 --> 01:02:09,080
they do not want more Democrats in 
office.

1466
01:02:09,081 --> 01:02:10,640
They're like,
he fucking nuts.

1467
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:11,713
Like this,
eight years of Clinton and then the 

1468
01:02:13,761 --> 01:02:16,400
eight years of Bush and then you've got 
eight years of Obama.

1469
01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:17,413
It's just stands to reason that you're 
going to want to have eight years of 

1470
01:02:19,711 --> 01:02:20,850
some Republican now

1471
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:22,890
you ma,
I don't know.

1472
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:23,850
I don't know.
I mean,

1473
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:25,370
I looked at the polls,
you know,

1474
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:29,940
I try not to follow because I just feel 
like it's so overwhelming at this point.

1475
01:02:29,941 --> 01:02:30,774
But,
um,

1476
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:33,180
I don't know.
I feel like she's in pretty good shape.

1477
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,130
Do you think so?
That's again,

1478
01:02:35,730 --> 01:02:36,750
I'm a comedian.
I'm like,

1479
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,360
like just what's today?
What's today?

1480
01:02:39,361 --> 01:02:41,370
The 2nd of August.
Yeah.

1481
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:42,690
So this is what I'm saying.
There's one sec.

1482
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:44,730
We voted in November.
We got along way to go.

1483
01:02:44,731 --> 01:02:45,564
We've got a hot 99 days.
Gary Johnson is going to be on your 

1484
01:02:48,121 --> 01:02:48,900
show.
Yeah,

1485
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:51,090
well he was supposed to be on the phone 
with him.

1486
01:02:51,530 --> 01:02:53,380
Where am I?
We're on a tweet with them.

1487
01:02:53,381 --> 01:02:54,214
When you mean,
well you tweeted something with my name 

1488
01:02:55,171 --> 01:02:56,004
and isn't it?
Oh,

1489
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:57,440
that's the first time I've ever,

1490
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:59,610
most likely he's going to have to pull 
out on Thursday,

1491
01:02:59,611 --> 01:03:01,610
but he'll be back again.
We've already had them on once before.

1492
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:02,700
It was,
he was great.

1493
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:03,630
Great.
He's great.

1494
01:03:03,631 --> 01:03:05,140
He's a good guy.
He's,

1495
01:03:05,150 --> 01:03:05,983
he's seat mean.
I don't know if I agree with him about 

1496
01:03:07,321 --> 01:03:09,240
everything,
but I agree with them about most things.

1497
01:03:10,050 --> 01:03:10,920
Uh,
you know,

1498
01:03:10,921 --> 01:03:15,090
he's got some interesting ideas,
but he's a reasonable person,

1499
01:03:15,330 --> 01:03:17,640
like an actual reasonable person,
meaning guy.

1500
01:03:17,730 --> 01:03:20,040
And the more he talks in,
the more he,

1501
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:21,353
the more he speaks.
If someone is going to get hurt by him 

1502
01:03:25,411 --> 01:03:27,250
being around the question,
is,

1503
01:03:27,251 --> 01:03:29,520
is going to be trump or is it going to 
be Clinton,

1504
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:32,520
someone's gonna get hurt by this 
reasonable alternative.

1505
01:03:32,790 --> 01:03:33,623
And this,
this is attitude that everybody has 

1506
01:03:34,951 --> 01:03:37,710
about who are you throwing your vote or 
if you're voted for him.

1507
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:40,680
Not everybody does this is,
this is,

1508
01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:41,543
this is a stupid attitude and the only 
thing that could possibly potentially 

1509
01:03:44,191 --> 01:03:47,310
fuck a third party candidate is the 
electoral college.

1510
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:49,530
Like that's where things get really 
weird.

1511
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:55,350
The Electoral College,
the idea of the representatives,

1512
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:59,190
you know like you don't necessarily vote
for,

1513
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:01,410
you know,
the state picks a representative.

1514
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:04,080
The representative is the one who kind 
of puts in the vote.

1515
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:06,630
Yeah.
So it's that could fuck them,

1516
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:08,663
but,
and also the idea that you're going to 

1517
01:04:10,491 --> 01:04:13,230
throw your vote away if you vote for a 
third party candidate,

1518
01:04:13,410 --> 01:04:16,500
that kind of fucks him.
But we're going to have to come at,

1519
01:04:16,570 --> 01:04:17,403
there's gonna come a time where we 
realized how ridiculous to pay two 

1520
01:04:19,531 --> 01:04:20,360
barter system.

1521
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,400
I'm with you on that.
Everybody is,

1522
01:04:22,430 --> 01:04:23,720
who thinks it's great,
it's ending.

1523
01:04:23,721 --> 01:04:25,130
I find me the person who thinks it's 
great.

1524
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:25,993
I think the DNC and the RNC think it's 
great that they get to participate in 

1525
01:04:30,261 --> 01:04:33,310
the debates and get money and all of 
that and it gets a really good,

1526
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:37,030
what they did it their way.
Ernie never had a chore burned.

1527
01:04:37,031 --> 01:04:37,864
He didn't have a chance.
Chance they rigged it and then she 

1528
01:04:39,891 --> 01:04:43,310
immediately goes to Hillary's campaign.
We get a nice juicy reward.

1529
01:04:43,311 --> 01:04:45,140
Come on over.
We'll get just some speech.

1530
01:04:45,170 --> 01:04:46,003
Oh,
you're talking about Wasserman 

1531
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:49,313
Wasserman.
Yeah.

1532
01:04:50,510 --> 01:04:51,680
Ah,
whatever.

1533
01:04:51,710 --> 01:04:52,543
I don't like talking politics.
I feel like it's like talking about a 

1534
01:04:54,591 --> 01:04:55,820
magic trick.
Well,

1535
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:58,010
what I really liked is when he made her 
11th grade,

1536
01:04:58,400 --> 01:04:59,810
he didn't really megger levitate,
man.

1537
01:04:59,811 --> 01:05:00,644
You know that.
Right.

1538
01:05:02,570 --> 01:05:04,640
All right.
Let me ask you about this then.

1539
01:05:04,850 --> 01:05:07,370
Please do talk about Michael Page.
Oh,

1540
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:08,660
okay.
Michael Venom page.

1541
01:05:09,010 --> 01:05:10,070
I let him.
That's his middle name.

1542
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:11,810
Yes.
Or just stage.

1543
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:13,000
You're talking about the fighter?
Yeah.

1544
01:05:13,170 --> 01:05:14,540
Okay.
Cause they just,

1545
01:05:14,541 --> 01:05:15,110
again,
I,

1546
01:05:15,110 --> 01:05:17,110
you know so much more about this than I 
did,

1547
01:05:17,111 --> 01:05:18,040
but I saw

1548
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:21,940
the highlights of that fight and then 
you tubed his other fights.

1549
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:22,793
Yeah.
And I've never seen anyone fight like 

1550
01:05:25,511 --> 01:05:26,344
this.
Have you watched his other fights 

1551
01:05:27,851 --> 01:05:30,160
because there's one in particular seeing
all of his fights.

1552
01:05:30,190 --> 01:05:31,023
Okay.
There was one in particular where he's 

1553
01:05:32,861 --> 01:05:33,694
fighting this guy and they get down to 
the ground and they're grappling around 

1554
01:05:35,810 --> 01:05:38,470
and all of a sudden he gets it.
The guy caught him in a leg lock.

1555
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:39,333
Yeah.
Gets the guy's foot and he looks at the 

1556
01:05:40,541 --> 01:05:41,374
guy and he started smiling as he's 
turning his foot and then the guy 

1557
01:05:43,871 --> 01:05:45,190
eventually at a,
yeah,

1558
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:47,440
and I was like,
this is like the,

1559
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:48,903
he's hands down.
Is that a style we don't fight hands 

1560
01:05:52,811 --> 01:05:54,220
down.
Well you can.

1561
01:05:54,370 --> 01:05:59,370
The thing about it is he has a very 
unusual set of skills.

1562
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:03,910
What he is is a,
a sport karate champion and what sport?

1563
01:06:03,910 --> 01:06:04,743
Karate is.
Point fighting is a style of fighting 

1564
01:06:08,050 --> 01:06:08,883
where you dive in and you were 
[inaudible] point card at karate 

1565
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:15,130
tournaments.
Just tell me just quickly,

1566
01:06:15,131 --> 01:06:16,450
I don't know what point.
Okay.

1567
01:06:16,810 --> 01:06:20,290
Point karate is.
The way it works is like there's a judge

1568
01:06:20,291 --> 01:06:21,124
on one side,
there's a judge on the other side and 

1569
01:06:22,271 --> 01:06:22,991
there's two.
There's,

1570
01:06:22,991 --> 01:06:26,890
well there oftentimes just several 
judges and there's two fighters.

1571
01:06:27,820 --> 01:06:31,390
And they stand the outside and the idea 
is they blitz at each other,

1572
01:06:31,391 --> 01:06:35,620
they dive in and the idea is to try to 
hit a guy once and if you tag them,

1573
01:06:35,621 --> 01:06:37,630
if you do tag and they stopped the 
action,

1574
01:06:37,810 --> 01:06:41,530
the referee steps in and then the 
referees will point.

1575
01:06:41,710 --> 01:06:44,920
Like oftentimes there's an exchange of 
blows and the referees will say,

1576
01:06:44,921 --> 01:06:48,520
I got him with the straight punch,
I got him with the round kick.

1577
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:52,930
And if there's no consensus,
they continue to fight and no one gets a

1578
01:06:52,931 --> 01:06:53,710
point.

1579
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:57,550
But if there is a consensus,
if one guy one the exchange,

1580
01:06:57,700 --> 01:07:00,160
they will give like there's a great 
point.

1581
01:07:00,161 --> 01:07:01,990
Karate fight,
um,

1582
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:02,913
between Michael Venom page and uh,
this guy who's a fighting and glory 

1583
01:07:07,991 --> 01:07:09,520
right now,
Raymond Daniels,

1584
01:07:09,730 --> 01:07:11,440
who's a,
also,

1585
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:16,180
he was originally a point karate 
champion who went over to kickboxing.

1586
01:07:16,181 --> 01:07:17,014
Glory is a big kickboxing organization,
whereas Michael Page fights for 

1587
01:07:21,101 --> 01:07:22,930
Bellatore.
So he's fighting MMA.

1588
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:23,973
Whereas this other guy who was a 
champion is like this is them fighting 

1589
01:07:28,931 --> 01:07:29,764
right now.
Right.

1590
01:07:29,980 --> 01:07:32,670
Is that page and I'm Daniel's.
Yeah.

1591
01:07:32,730 --> 01:07:33,880
All right,
I see it.

1592
01:07:33,910 --> 01:07:34,743
See how they fight.
They wear these helmets on and the idea 

1593
01:07:36,971 --> 01:07:41,971
is to just score to dive in and hit each
other and then get out.

1594
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:45,040
And if they can hit each other and score
cleanly,

1595
01:07:45,250 --> 01:07:47,110
like watch what happens when they score,
you'll see it.

1596
01:07:48,370 --> 01:07:51,070
So they're bouncing around,
they move very fast.

1597
01:07:51,430 --> 01:07:52,263
And the idea behind this is the blitz.
So they noticed beeping in and 

1598
01:07:54,971 --> 01:07:56,980
attacking,
see how they bolt of their hands down.

1599
01:07:57,130 --> 01:07:58,750
Well,
I didn't feel like the other guy has his

1600
01:07:58,751 --> 01:08:00,350
hands up a little more than Michael 
Page.

1601
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:01,740
Michael White?
No.

1602
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,810
Yes,
he is the bulk of the notes down.

1603
01:08:03,850 --> 01:08:04,683
They both have their hands down and the 
other guy lifts his hands up 

1604
01:08:06,941 --> 01:08:08,200
occasionally,
but no,

1605
01:08:08,201 --> 01:08:10,060
they both have their hands completely 
down.

1606
01:08:10,630 --> 01:08:12,640
The Orthodox method of holding your 
hands up,

1607
01:08:12,641 --> 01:08:17,300
your hands would be at your cheekbones.
These guys are not fighting and remotely

1608
01:08:17,301 --> 01:08:18,134
like that.
They're both very similar in their 

1609
01:08:19,881 --> 01:08:20,714
style.
Okay,

1610
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:22,820
I understand.
But this style,

1611
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:24,373
I know Sandy,
like 80 people in the crowd who goes to 

1612
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:29,390
this,
mostly karate students most,

1613
01:08:29,391 --> 01:08:32,330
it's mostly people that are either their
students,

1614
01:08:32,390 --> 01:08:33,223
their fellow students are competing and 
they're sitting there watching or 

1615
01:08:35,091 --> 01:08:38,570
they're going to compete and they watch,
or the families of the people competing.

1616
01:08:38,810 --> 01:08:41,360
But it never really became much of a 
spectator sport.

1617
01:08:41,390 --> 01:08:44,510
I could understand that,
but it's a very unique talent.

1618
01:08:44,540 --> 01:08:48,080
The ability to leap in and perform those
techniques very quickly.

1619
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:49,123
And most fighters don't have that timing
and they don't know how to avoid it and 

1620
01:08:53,451 --> 01:08:55,460
they don't have the ability to avoid 
that.

1621
01:08:55,461 --> 01:08:57,350
Crazy bummer.
How's good to see you?

1622
01:08:57,360 --> 01:08:58,670
Very good.
Very good.

1623
01:08:58,940 --> 01:09:01,100
Well he was a world champion and a sport
karate.

1624
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:02,533
Okay,
okay.

1625
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:05,390
That stuff.
He's a world champion and so what he had

1626
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:07,850
to do is you just had to learn,
take down defense,

1627
01:09:08,030 --> 01:09:10,250
and then he had to learn some 
submissions and some grappling.

1628
01:09:10,470 --> 01:09:12,020
It takes a long time to learn those 
things.

1629
01:09:12,021 --> 01:09:16,010
But if you are the type of person that 
could become a champion in one aspect of

1630
01:09:16,011 --> 01:09:16,844
martial arts,
that type of intense dedication and 

1631
01:09:19,311 --> 01:09:20,144
focus,
you could transfer that potentially to 

1632
01:09:21,951 --> 01:09:24,500
other martial arts if you have the time 
and you have an inclination.

1633
01:09:24,530 --> 01:09:25,363
Well,
I read something that you said that was 

1634
01:09:26,301 --> 01:09:28,520
the worst injury you ever,
so yeah.

1635
01:09:28,730 --> 01:09:31,080
Is that hyperbole or no?
No.

1636
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:31,973
So worst mma.
I'm never seen anybody get their skull 

1637
01:09:33,291 --> 01:09:35,750
crushed.
That's the worst injury I've ever seen.

1638
01:09:35,990 --> 01:09:39,320
I've seen broken orbital bones.
That's fairly common.

1639
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:40,820
All right.
The uh,

1640
01:09:41,090 --> 01:09:44,600
the bones around your eyeball or are 
fairly fragile,

1641
01:09:44,810 --> 01:09:45,643
but the forehead,
I've never seen anybody's forehead get 

1642
01:09:46,911 --> 01:09:47,744
crushed,
but as a perfect storm [inaudible] he 

1643
01:09:50,721 --> 01:09:54,050
charged in,
tried to shoot for a take down and page,

1644
01:09:54,051 --> 01:09:56,480
caught him with a knee.
He leaped in.

1645
01:09:56,540 --> 01:09:57,610
Elite caught him.
Yeah.

1646
01:09:57,650 --> 01:10:00,200
What's the name of that jumping knee?
Say it again.

1647
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:01,063
Jumping knee.
You just jumped up and hit him with a 

1648
01:10:03,141 --> 01:10:05,240
knee pain.
Jumping knee.

1649
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:10,300
That sounds like a,
like an Indian who didn't need yeah,

1650
01:10:12,140 --> 01:10:14,050
and jumping.
I said,

1651
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:15,170
hey,
wow.

1652
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:17,450
It is intense to see Joe.
Yeah,

1653
01:10:17,451 --> 01:10:18,284
it was intense.

1654
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:19,050
Yeah.
I mean,

1655
01:10:19,050 --> 01:10:19,910
I'm not kidding.
It was,

1656
01:10:19,911 --> 01:10:20,990
I was like,
whoa.

1657
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:21,853
Well I've been involved in martial arts 
for more than since you were scared 

1658
01:10:26,090 --> 01:10:27,020
little child.
Yeah.

1659
01:10:27,021 --> 01:10:27,854
More than 30 years.
And I've never seen that injury and 

1660
01:10:30,091 --> 01:10:31,460
never seen it that bad.
Well,

1661
01:10:31,461 --> 01:10:34,730
I saw also your buddy,
I don't know if he's your buddy.

1662
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:35,841
Um,
Silva.

1663
01:10:35,841 --> 01:10:39,710
What's his first Anderson Silva.
Anderson Silva break his own leg.

1664
01:10:40,070 --> 01:10:42,090
I've seen that before.
I've seen that a couple of times.

1665
01:10:42,110 --> 01:10:43,100
You ever done that?
No,

1666
01:10:43,101 --> 01:10:45,350
I've never your own leg?
No,

1667
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:48,320
but I did get my leg broken before I 
broke the,

1668
01:10:48,321 --> 01:10:49,180
um,
not the,

1669
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:52,340
with the Tibia as the large shin bone.
I broke the fibula.

1670
01:10:52,610 --> 01:10:55,820
Somebody we collided.
It was actually a sparring session.

1671
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:57,133
A friend of mine,
a threw a kick and I have through kick 

1672
01:10:58,491 --> 01:10:59,324
at the same time and his heel hit my 
fibula and I've got a hairline fracture 

1673
01:11:02,541 --> 01:11:04,850
in my fibula but not broken.

1674
01:11:04,850 --> 01:11:07,980
Like it didn't break like that,
but it could have seen.

1675
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:09,950
Had you seen that before?
Yes.

1676
01:11:10,220 --> 01:11:11,053
See what happened to Anderson is he 
broke it earlier and then he broke it 

1677
01:11:13,590 --> 01:11:15,630
all the way through,
so he cracked it.

1678
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:16,613
Oh,
one kick that he threw in the same 

1679
01:11:17,821 --> 01:11:18,654
height.
Yup.

1680
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:20,290
Oh crap.
Hey.

1681
01:11:20,291 --> 01:11:22,740
He really cracked it before that because
he,

1682
01:11:22,741 --> 01:11:23,910
it was,
it was hurting,

1683
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:25,223
and then he threw that kick and hit the 
exact same spot and just snap like a 

1684
01:11:28,171 --> 01:11:30,450
twig.
That's according to his manager.

1685
01:11:30,451 --> 01:11:34,440
His manager feels like he broke it 
before that and then broke it again.

1686
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:37,590
It's very unusual to see someone's legs 
snap like that,

1687
01:11:37,591 --> 01:11:40,530
but it happens.
There it is right there.

1688
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:44,520
I've seen it happen three times.
Person giving,

1689
01:11:44,610 --> 01:11:45,443
kicking.
It's always the person kicking the 

1690
01:11:46,771 --> 01:11:48,620
person kicking price their own legs.
Yeah.

1691
01:11:48,750 --> 01:11:51,180
Occasionally it's the person on the 
other side,

1692
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,370
but it's a,
what the difference is,

1693
01:11:53,371 --> 01:11:54,204
is where you're kicking,
you're kicking with the middle or the 

1694
01:11:56,551 --> 01:11:59,100
bottom of your Shin,
which is a thinner bone.

1695
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:00,233
Oh.
Then you're colliding with the top of 

1696
01:12:01,621 --> 01:12:04,500
the knee where the,
the the Tibia,

1697
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:07,890
the knee.
It didn't seem possible.

1698
01:12:08,030 --> 01:12:11,120
It just didn't seem there.
You could see it as snapping.

1699
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:13,140
Yeah.
Do you remember Joe Theismann?

1700
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:14,850
Yeah.
Remember that Monday night game?

1701
01:12:15,210 --> 01:12:16,860
Yeah.
Yeah.

1702
01:12:16,861 --> 01:12:19,770
I'm broken legs or particularly 
disturbing for people.

1703
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:23,100
There's a guy named tyrone spong.
But you're saying not for you like,

1704
01:12:23,250 --> 01:12:24,240
yeah,
I mean it bothers me,

1705
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:27,240
but you're looking at me like you people
that,

1706
01:12:27,390 --> 01:12:28,620
that probably about it.
You Wayne.

1707
01:12:28,740 --> 01:12:32,730
I have seen for sure I've seen way too 
many people get injured.

1708
01:12:32,850 --> 01:12:35,070
Right.
So you're a little more immune to little

1709
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:36,900
immune.
I've told the story before,

1710
01:12:36,901 --> 01:12:39,260
but this is,
my wife was there,

1711
01:12:39,590 --> 01:12:41,120
her leg.
She had the uh,

1712
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:42,060
card,
uh,

1713
01:12:42,061 --> 01:12:43,470
hatch,
you know,

1714
01:12:43,471 --> 01:12:44,304
like the back of the hatch and she had a
package and she lifted her head up and 

1715
01:12:47,341 --> 01:12:51,510
hit the corner of the hatch and cut her 
for it and blood pouring down her head.

1716
01:12:51,780 --> 01:12:55,200
She was freaking out because she was 
bleeding and I looked at it,

1717
01:12:55,201 --> 01:12:58,020
I was like snuffin,
it's like mica stitch like one stitch.

1718
01:12:58,050 --> 01:12:59,040
It's nothing.
Don't worry about it.

1719
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:00,210
Like to me,
I was like,

1720
01:13:00,211 --> 01:13:01,230
walk it off.
Like,

1721
01:13:01,231 --> 01:13:04,830
this is nothing like I'm so used to 
seeing people just caught open,

1722
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:06,810
smashed,
broken nose,

1723
01:13:06,811 --> 01:13:09,660
swollen eyes,
cuts all over their face,

1724
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:11,340
head kick,
knockouts,

1725
01:13:11,370 --> 01:13:13,800
arm's broken,
snapped legs,

1726
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:15,420
torn apart,
knees.

1727
01:13:15,421 --> 01:13:16,254
I'm so used to it.
And that's just in the comedy clubs 

1728
01:13:20,070 --> 01:13:23,790
Janam hell and try to win.
So you've seen it all.

1729
01:13:23,850 --> 01:13:27,360
I've just seen thousands of fights.
I mean I've seen,

1730
01:13:27,361 --> 01:13:31,410
I've called professionally at least 
probably 1500 funds.

1731
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:35,310
So I've seen so many knockouts and so 
many injuries.

1732
01:13:35,311 --> 01:13:38,910
I'm so used to seeing trauma almost too 
used to it.

1733
01:13:38,911 --> 01:13:41,860
Like it doesn't bother me.
How can people get injured?

1734
01:13:42,940 --> 01:13:45,630
And that was paid 100% a hundred percent
the worst.

1735
01:13:45,870 --> 01:13:47,790
Definitely the worst.
Never seen that.

1736
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:49,173
That's your fucking brain.
That's the protection that your brain 

1737
01:13:51,331 --> 01:13:53,640
has to the outside world.
It's basically gone.

1738
01:13:53,940 --> 01:13:55,680
And if he got hit again,
that same spot,

1739
01:13:55,860 --> 01:13:57,180
he's probably dead.
Dead.

1740
01:13:57,390 --> 01:13:58,350
Yeah.
I mean,

1741
01:13:58,351 --> 01:13:59,250
how's he doing?
How's,

1742
01:13:59,251 --> 01:14:00,390
he said look,
you know,

1743
01:14:00,750 --> 01:14:03,540
we can see how he's doing.
That's the surgery.

1744
01:14:03,541 --> 01:14:05,220
The pictures on the ride or post 
surgery?

1745
01:14:06,020 --> 01:14:08,190
Yeah.
Is that what they put in there and those

1746
01:14:08,191 --> 01:14:10,800
little metal look in there,
you can see it.

1747
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:13,540
It's a,
those are plates that they've,

1748
01:14:13,541 --> 01:14:14,374
uh,
most likely titanium that they've 

1749
01:14:15,731 --> 01:14:17,920
screwed in place to,
uh,

1750
01:14:17,980 --> 01:14:22,210
sort of reconstruct his scholar on of 
his skull.

1751
01:14:22,270 --> 01:14:23,103
Yeah,
they've pulled it up and he wheeling 

1752
01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:26,410
ever wrestle again.
Fight.

1753
01:14:26,411 --> 01:14:27,460
You mean fight?
Yeah,

1754
01:14:27,470 --> 01:14:28,990
me starts,
I could wrestle again.

1755
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:29,560
The,
the,

1756
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:34,560
the question remains is if any 
psychosocial psychological,

1757
01:14:35,140 --> 01:14:36,490
it's not what I would be worried about.

1758
01:14:36,490 --> 01:14:37,323
I'd be worried about the actual 
physiological damage is more than 

1759
01:14:38,921 --> 01:14:39,870
psychology.
Yeah.

1760
01:14:39,950 --> 01:14:40,783
Expanding.
Well,

1761
01:14:40,930 --> 01:14:43,990
he had to get his fucking skin pulled 
back.

1762
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:45,063
I mean if you look at what they did,
they literally made a scar around the 

1763
01:14:47,621 --> 01:14:49,710
top of his head.
Look at what it needed.

1764
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:52,990
His hairline is essentially a giant scar
now.

1765
01:14:53,170 --> 01:14:54,003
They pulled his face forward and they 
rebuilt his forehead with these fucking 

1766
01:15:00,041 --> 01:15:01,510
bolt there.
He buys knows too.

1767
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:04,720
Apparently his nose a shatter too,
but you know,

1768
01:15:04,721 --> 01:15:08,890
it's like a very,
very significant injury and I just think

1769
01:15:08,891 --> 01:15:12,490
psychologically you could never maybe 
get used to it.

1770
01:15:13,330 --> 01:15:16,150
Get used to getting hurt.
Guys get used to getting knocked down.

1771
01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:18,490
Guys get used to getting punched.
You get used to it.

1772
01:15:18,850 --> 01:15:19,780
It's,
you know,

1773
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:21,093
it's a part of who you are,
if that's what you choose to do for a 

1774
01:15:23,201 --> 01:15:25,540
living.
But I mean his [inaudible] have you been

1775
01:15:25,541 --> 01:15:27,700
knocked out like out nick unconscious?

1776
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:28,930
No,
I've never been mugged out.

1777
01:15:28,990 --> 01:15:29,410
Yeah,
I've,

1778
01:15:29,410 --> 01:15:32,050
I've been dropped.
I got [inaudible],

1779
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:35,750
I got hit and my legs went out.
Like you get hit in the jaw and you seem

1780
01:15:35,751 --> 01:15:40,060
like stop working and you just collapse.
And then I got back up and I got dropped

1781
01:15:40,061 --> 01:15:40,894
again and the referee stopped the fight.
But I was conscious that was the last 

1782
01:15:43,061 --> 01:15:44,580
fight I ever had.
That was a kickboxing fight.

1783
01:15:44,590 --> 01:15:45,670
That was it.
Yeah.

1784
01:15:45,730 --> 01:15:48,170
Well I was already,
did you ever have a nickname?

1785
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:49,173
Never had a nickname.
If you could tell it was this guy's 

1786
01:15:52,210 --> 01:15:52,561
nick.
Nick,

1787
01:15:52,561 --> 01:15:55,390
could both these guys have one with his 
nickname was cyborg.

1788
01:15:55,391 --> 01:15:57,520
Cyborg and venom and venom.
Yeah.

1789
01:15:57,970 --> 01:16:00,220
Okay.
Let's say you could go back,

1790
01:16:00,310 --> 01:16:01,750
pick a nickname,
sweetie pie.

1791
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:05,470
You'll go to the ADC,
this two guys and kissed each other.

1792
01:16:05,471 --> 01:16:06,460
Who were they?
Who were they?

1793
01:16:06,461 --> 01:16:07,160
What are you talking about?

1794
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:09,580
Some like face and watching porn.
No,

1795
01:16:09,910 --> 01:16:11,410
Ella MMA thing.
Oh,

1796
01:16:11,411 --> 01:16:14,240
long time ago.
Herring and this Japanese gentleman,

1797
01:16:14,890 --> 01:16:16,540
I knew he wouldn't eat herring.
Knocked him out.

1798
01:16:17,110 --> 01:16:17,920
Oh,
he can't stay.

1799
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:19,840
I looked at the guy.
No,

1800
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:22,600
I mean maybe it's a different one.
Maybe talking about different one.

1801
01:16:22,601 --> 01:16:24,520
You're talking about Anderson Silva and 
Chris Weidman.

1802
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:27,160
Anderson Silva like touched faces with 
Weidman.

1803
01:16:27,161 --> 01:16:30,190
Weidman's just wouldn't move.
There's possible this it right here.

1804
01:16:30,940 --> 01:16:32,540
Is that the one?
No,

1805
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:34,133
no.
I know,

1806
01:16:34,150 --> 01:16:34,983
I know.
The guys listening on the podcast can't 

1807
01:16:36,011 --> 01:16:36,844
see,
but the is like two guys faces rate up 

1808
01:16:38,820 --> 01:16:39,653
again.
Here's the silver and Chris Weidman 

1809
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:46,120
Silva is were like nose to nose and then
one guy kind of kissed his stem and then

1810
01:16:46,121 --> 01:16:48,340
the other guy kissed him back and then 
they kind of,

1811
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:50,180
I haven't seen that.
I haven't seen that.

1812
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:52,780
I saw that one.
Well I probably have,

1813
01:16:52,781 --> 01:16:53,410
I just forgot.

1814
01:16:53,410 --> 01:16:55,630
But the,
the really funny one was Anderson,

1815
01:16:55,660 --> 01:16:56,493
not Anderson Silva.
Heath herring was doing a face off with 

1816
01:16:59,111 --> 01:17:01,120
this Japanese gentlemen.
I don't remember the guy's name,

1817
01:17:01,121 --> 01:17:03,160
but the guy kissed him on the lips and 
he tearing,

1818
01:17:03,161 --> 01:17:06,040
knocked him out cold as they were like 
doing the stare down.

1819
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:08,740
He hit him with a right hook and kit.
Wash it right here.

1820
01:17:09,290 --> 01:17:11,450
This is a heat herring,
Texas.

1821
01:17:11,451 --> 01:17:13,040
Crazy horse.
Bad motherfucker.

1822
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:15,990
So they get face to face watch.
Okay,

1823
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:17,900
there's standing face to face.
He kisses him,

1824
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:22,790
boom.
Kaos him out cold and you lose the fight

1825
01:17:22,791 --> 01:17:24,950
automatically if you hit before the 
you're,

1826
01:17:24,990 --> 01:17:26,960
it's supposed to kiss people.
So wait.

1827
01:17:27,020 --> 01:17:32,020
So I don't know if he lost,
I think Japanese look at things entirely

1828
01:17:32,961 --> 01:17:33,794
differently.
The Japanese people might've rewarded 

1829
01:17:35,091 --> 01:17:37,220
him for this because it's part of the 
spectacle.

1830
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:39,170
It's a spectacle of look at.
He's like,

1831
01:17:39,171 --> 01:17:40,790
what the fuck man,
don't kiss me.

1832
01:17:41,230 --> 01:17:42,890
And he said he right.
So I was like,

1833
01:17:42,891 --> 01:17:44,150
I'm sorry the guy.
Yes ma'am.

1834
01:17:44,180 --> 01:17:45,950
Don't fucking desk.
Hey tearing.

1835
01:17:45,951 --> 01:17:48,110
Now you know the next guy won't kiss 
them.

1836
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:49,760
Do not.
He's pointing down on the ground.

1837
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:51,980
Look,
he said he kissed and I fucking hit him.

1838
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:53,180
Well,
what do you want me to do?

1839
01:17:53,181 --> 01:17:53,901
I'm sorry.
All right,

1840
01:17:53,901 --> 01:17:54,734
I'm sorry.
I thought I saw another one more guy 

1841
01:17:56,241 --> 01:17:58,010
kissed the guy.
I think you did.

1842
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:59,060
All right.
I think you did.

1843
01:17:59,061 --> 01:18:02,660
I now remember the guy kissed and the 
other guy kissed and they laughed.

1844
01:18:02,770 --> 01:18:03,490
Yeah,
yeah,

1845
01:18:03,490 --> 01:18:04,610
yeah.
I'm just getting that one.

1846
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:08,570
It was though Mike Bernardo might've 
been a k one bout.

1847
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:10,700
Maybe it's,
you know these guys more than I do.

1848
01:18:10,940 --> 01:18:12,650
Talk to me about the stare down a little
bit.

1849
01:18:13,130 --> 01:18:15,320
What about it?
Cause I saw one,

1850
01:18:15,321 --> 01:18:20,321
your buddy Anderson Silva one cause at 
one time it didn't look at the guy.

1851
01:18:21,140 --> 01:18:21,973
A lot of times guys don't look at him 
like bobby witness strategy is on that 

1852
01:18:24,350 --> 01:18:25,183
boss.
Rutan didn't look at guys a fade or a 

1853
01:18:27,170 --> 01:18:28,880
million ankle was probably one of the 
greatest of all time.

1854
01:18:28,910 --> 01:18:30,640
Not Probably.
Definitely one of the greatest days.

1855
01:18:30,660 --> 01:18:34,510
Name again fade or a million inco.
He's absolutely,

1856
01:18:34,511 --> 01:18:36,620
he's a Russian gentleman.
His name is he the,

1857
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:39,080
in Russia they don't even say Fado.
They say fuel door,

1858
01:18:39,140 --> 01:18:40,400
fuel door,
a million ankle.

1859
01:18:40,401 --> 01:18:42,110
But it's,
it's spelled in,

1860
01:18:42,210 --> 01:18:44,630
you know,
obviously it's English as version.

1861
01:18:44,690 --> 01:18:45,523
The version of the way we spell it.
It's different than the way they spell 

1862
01:18:47,721 --> 01:18:49,370
it because they use different,
when did he,

1863
01:18:49,620 --> 01:18:50,810
when did he fight?
Well,

1864
01:18:50,811 --> 01:18:51,644
he's still fighting.
He just started a fighting again 

1865
01:18:53,391 --> 01:18:56,060
recently.
He just fought and won but looked really

1866
01:18:56,061 --> 01:18:57,140
bad.
Right.

1867
01:18:57,350 --> 01:18:59,930
This is a different fight.
This is a different stare down.

1868
01:18:59,931 --> 01:19:02,450
These guys are going to kiss too now I,
oh,

1869
01:19:02,451 --> 01:19:03,890
he kissed him and the other guy got mad.

1870
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:05,030
Ooh.
I don't really,

1871
01:19:05,031 --> 01:19:06,830
don't have to keep watching guys get 
suddenly.

1872
01:19:07,310 --> 01:19:10,370
I don't want to be known as Wayne 
Fetterman just loves guys kissing.

1873
01:19:10,371 --> 01:19:11,204
That's not,
and we'd just so he wouldn't look at 

1874
01:19:14,211 --> 01:19:16,010
them.
He looked down a cause.

1875
01:19:16,011 --> 01:19:17,600
This is a waste of energy.
Did you?

1876
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:18,900
Oh,
waste of energy.

1877
01:19:18,901 --> 01:19:19,521
Yeah,
you can.

1878
01:19:19,521 --> 01:19:21,440
You,
if you get anxious,

1879
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:24,310
you get anxious about it.
It's a waste of energy.

1880
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:25,810
Not a,
uh,

1881
01:19:25,820 --> 01:19:28,790
what's the word for like,
like intimidation.

1882
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:30,680
Nonsense.
Honestly,

1883
01:19:30,681 --> 01:19:32,330
it's nonsense because you're going to 
fight.

1884
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:33,193
It's raw.
It's already wrapped and then she 

1885
01:19:34,290 --> 01:19:35,123
already happening.
So you don't have some guys who are 

1886
01:19:36,081 --> 01:19:37,760
really good at it.
Some guys,

1887
01:19:37,761 --> 01:19:40,940
like some guy and also some guys would 
get angry if other guys were doing it,

1888
01:19:40,941 --> 01:19:42,830
so they would out stare them down.
Like,

1889
01:19:42,831 --> 01:19:45,590
here's the best stare down of all time 
in MMA.

1890
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:46,730
I'll show you the best steer down.

1891
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:49,940
Right.
Mirko Cro cop versus vandelay Silva.

1892
01:19:49,970 --> 01:19:54,050
This is the best stare down ever because
Vander Ley was,

1893
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:55,910
they used,
his nickname is the ax murderer.

1894
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:59,240
He's a fucking savage.
He was a pride middleweight champion.

1895
01:19:59,241 --> 01:20:01,370
Bad motherfucker.
Just a bad mother.

1896
01:20:01,371 --> 01:20:02,204
But he was fighting Mirko Cro cop who 
was the head of an antiterrorist 

1897
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:09,810
squadron in Croatia and he's a real 
murder.

1898
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:10,853
This is you talking about a different 
kind of fucking straight up killer and 

1899
01:20:13,860 --> 01:20:17,520
an elite high level kickboxer so look at
cro cop on the left.

1900
01:20:17,550 --> 01:20:18,960
Yeah,
I sam C.

1901
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:19,793
Dot.
That's the eyes of the guy who's killed 

1902
01:20:20,701 --> 01:20:21,534
someone with a knife.
See is a fucking completely different 

1903
01:20:23,851 --> 01:20:24,684
stare down here.
Cro gobs looking at him and he's not 

1904
01:20:27,481 --> 01:20:28,314
budging.
This is the first time we're vandelay 

1905
01:20:30,121 --> 01:20:34,890
lost a stare down.
A vandelay was used to staring guys down

1906
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:35,963
and they would be intimidated.
And the Cro cop looked at him like he 

1907
01:20:38,731 --> 01:20:40,230
was dinner and Cro.

1908
01:20:40,230 --> 01:20:44,010
Cop wound up head kicking him like 
video,

1909
01:20:44,011 --> 01:20:44,810
um,
pull up,

1910
01:20:44,810 --> 01:20:46,200
uh,
Mirko Cro,

1911
01:20:46,201 --> 01:20:49,710
Cop k o vandelay Silva.
Can I say on a side note,

1912
01:20:49,711 --> 01:20:52,050
one of the greatest head kick knockouts 
ever?

1913
01:20:52,110 --> 01:20:52,741
Yeah,
I want to see it.

1914
01:20:52,741 --> 01:20:53,574
But on a side note,
it's impressive that you know all these 

1915
01:20:55,681 --> 01:20:57,920
guys names.
Well,

1916
01:20:57,930 --> 01:20:59,550
it's part of my job.
I understand,

1917
01:20:59,551 --> 01:21:02,480
but it's still like,
I feel like they're like friends.

1918
01:21:02,910 --> 01:21:04,820
It's only impressive because you don't 
know their names.

1919
01:21:05,130 --> 01:21:07,290
If you were like another mma fan,
you blink.

1920
01:21:07,291 --> 01:21:08,920
Yeah.
Rogan knows those guys names.

1921
01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:12,060
It's as he supposed to know those well 
fellow comedian.

1922
01:21:12,061 --> 01:21:12,894
I'm just saying it's a break.
You've gotta be the only comedian that 

1923
01:21:14,671 --> 01:21:17,070
knows all these guys names.
Maybe Adam Hunter.

1924
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:18,570
He probably would know it.
He's,

1925
01:21:18,571 --> 01:21:21,270
he's a big fan anyway.
Just probably wouldn't know.

1926
01:21:21,330 --> 01:21:22,620
Maybe as many,
I don't know.

1927
01:21:22,621 --> 01:21:23,760
Maybe it does.
It's impressive.

1928
01:21:23,940 --> 01:21:24,721
Well,
I just,

1929
01:21:24,721 --> 01:21:27,300
I don't,
I don't know a lot of sports.

1930
01:21:27,301 --> 01:21:29,790
Like you guys were talking about 
basketball before the show started.

1931
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:32,160
I don't know Jack Shit about basketball.
I,

1932
01:21:32,161 --> 01:21:32,994
there's a limited amount of data that a 
man keeping his head or a woman I'm 

1933
01:21:35,580 --> 01:21:36,480
assuming.
Right.

1934
01:21:36,780 --> 01:21:38,070
And I just don't,
you know,

1935
01:21:38,190 --> 01:21:40,560
I only have so many stats.
Of course.

1936
01:21:40,561 --> 01:21:41,330
Of course.
My,

1937
01:21:41,330 --> 01:21:44,120
my stats are filled up with I before we 
get to this spice.

1938
01:21:44,121 --> 01:21:44,940
This,
all right.

1939
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:46,440
This is Mirko Cro cop.
Well,

1940
01:21:46,441 --> 01:21:49,170
this is a slow motion version of it.
Watch this.

1941
01:21:49,350 --> 01:21:50,183
Ooh.
That's those two guys that were staring 

1942
01:21:52,531 --> 01:21:53,730
each other down.
Oh,

1943
01:21:53,731 --> 01:21:54,564
I see.
Yeah.

1944
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:57,060
With a stare down is actually from their
first fight.

1945
01:21:57,061 --> 01:21:58,740
The head kick was from their second 
fight.

1946
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:02,960
Anyway.
Um,

1947
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:05,460
stats head kicks.
No,

1948
01:22:05,470 --> 01:22:05,751
no,
no,

1949
01:22:05,751 --> 01:22:06,584
no.
I know.

1950
01:22:07,010 --> 01:22:07,843
No,
I know.

1951
01:22:08,220 --> 01:22:12,150
I was going to ask you of the sports 
that you don't follow,

1952
01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:14,730
what are your favorites?
What are your least favorites?

1953
01:22:15,690 --> 01:22:17,970
I don't really care about any of them.
They can get them all illegal.

1954
01:22:17,971 --> 01:22:20,280
I wouldn't give a fuck baseball,
nothing.

1955
01:22:20,610 --> 01:22:22,080
Waste of time.
Okay.

1956
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:23,030
Can you just say you're name

1957
01:22:29,230 --> 01:22:30,063
right,
but he forgot to touch the bag that was 

1958
01:22:32,651 --> 01:22:34,400
on the ground so it didn't,

1959
01:22:36,250 --> 01:22:39,370
is it because you think that this is the
ultimate sport?

1960
01:22:39,371 --> 01:22:40,820
Because it's,
it's not,

1961
01:22:40,821 --> 01:22:41,654
it's not the oil down that it's the 
ultimate sport because it is boiled 

1962
01:22:43,661 --> 01:22:44,494
down.
It is unquestionably the most exciting 

1963
01:22:45,551 --> 01:22:46,384
thing.
The two human beings can engage in it 

1964
01:22:47,660 --> 01:22:49,780
because it's not a game.
It's a game,

1965
01:22:49,860 --> 01:22:50,693
right.
Consequence.

1966
01:22:51,070 --> 01:22:55,030
It's high level problem solving with 
dire physical consequences.

1967
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:56,190
That's interest.
That's really,

1968
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:57,760
did you come up with that?
Yes.

1969
01:22:57,910 --> 01:22:59,680
That's mine.
That's pretty good.

1970
01:22:59,770 --> 01:23:00,603
Yeah.
Say it again.

1971
01:23:00,610 --> 01:23:04,820
High level problem solving with dire 
physical consequences.

1972
01:23:04,850 --> 01:23:05,880
Right.
Okay.

1973
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:06,100
All

1974
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:07,260
right.
So,

1975
01:23:07,261 --> 01:23:09,250
um,
so well I don't even have to get through

1976
01:23:09,251 --> 01:23:10,230
baseball,
soccer,

1977
01:23:10,510 --> 01:23:11,343
the soccer when he is interested.
It's bunker impression about all of 

1978
01:23:13,961 --> 01:23:14,794
them.
I've been watching soccer recently 

1979
01:23:18,551 --> 01:23:19,384
because I'm friends with Ian Edwards and
he's a giant soccer fan and he actually 

1980
01:23:21,641 --> 01:23:25,210
has a soccer podcast and uh,
he's been trying to get me into soccer,

1981
01:23:25,211 --> 01:23:26,950
so we watched a bunch of soccer games 
together.

1982
01:23:27,340 --> 01:23:28,570
Matches.
It's fun,

1983
01:23:28,870 --> 01:23:29,703
it's fun,
but when they get smacked accidentally 

1984
01:23:32,411 --> 01:23:34,480
and they go down like bitches,
oh,

1985
01:23:34,481 --> 01:23:35,560
I can't,
I can't.

1986
01:23:35,561 --> 01:23:37,360
It's the worst thing.
I agree with you.

1987
01:23:37,630 --> 01:23:39,430
I looked at him,
I looked over at Ian and I'm like,

1988
01:23:39,431 --> 01:23:41,860
I can't support this kind of fucking 
pussy behavior.

1989
01:23:41,950 --> 01:23:45,430
This is horrible.
I that I agree with you 100%.

1990
01:23:45,431 --> 01:23:47,800
Yeah.
That's hard to watch.

1991
01:23:47,860 --> 01:23:50,590
That is hard to watch because it's like 
you're a competitor.

1992
01:23:50,650 --> 01:23:52,780
You're a competitor.
Like it's pathetic.

1993
01:23:53,110 --> 01:23:54,670
It's pathetic.
You agree with everything.

1994
01:23:54,730 --> 01:23:56,380
Someone knows when someone's smacks him 
on,

1995
01:23:56,410 --> 01:23:58,090
you know,
everyone knows you could see it.

1996
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:00,310
They have replaced,
you don't have to go down like a bitch.

1997
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:03,340
You have to hold your face and roll 
around the ground and agony.

1998
01:24:03,550 --> 01:24:05,260
Especially when you've seen what I've 
seen.

1999
01:24:05,261 --> 01:24:07,120
You seen guys get right kneed in the 
face,

2000
01:24:07,121 --> 01:24:08,380
like Cyborg,
you know,

2001
01:24:08,381 --> 01:24:09,214
like,
or any event venoms knee into Cyborg 

2002
01:24:12,070 --> 01:24:13,010
skull.
Yeah,

2003
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:15,130
I know these guys names now.
Now you do.

2004
01:24:15,190 --> 01:24:16,290
Well,
just their nicknames.

2005
01:24:16,750 --> 01:24:18,850
It's um,
but it's an interesting sport.

2006
01:24:18,940 --> 01:24:20,920
It's an interesting sport in that,
you know,

2007
01:24:20,921 --> 01:24:21,754
it's,
there's some pretty complex strategy 

2008
01:24:23,141 --> 01:24:24,280
going on.
There's a lot of move.

2009
01:24:24,290 --> 01:24:25,123
Now.
I remember I talked to you about this 

2010
01:24:26,141 --> 01:24:26,974
long time ago.
There was a great episode of either CNN 

2011
01:24:30,251 --> 01:24:31,084
sports or espn when they brought you on 
to talk about how horrible mma was 

2012
01:24:35,411 --> 01:24:40,411
compared to boxing and then you in a 
very skilled manner,

2013
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:44,080
took apart the interviewer and the other
guy with a,

2014
01:24:44,081 --> 01:24:44,914
your knowledge boxing and then be 
explaining why you thought mma or I 

2015
01:24:49,991 --> 01:24:51,880
don't even know if that's the right 
transport term,

2016
01:24:52,230 --> 01:24:53,710
uh,
was,

2017
01:24:53,711 --> 01:24:54,580
uh,
the APP,

2018
01:24:54,610 --> 01:24:56,710
the natural evolution of what was going 
on.

2019
01:24:57,160 --> 01:24:58,360
Well,
people remember that.

2020
01:24:58,390 --> 01:24:59,440
Yes.
Do you talk to,

2021
01:24:59,460 --> 01:25:00,293
I'm assuming you're talking about that a
lot on this podcast are now to talk 

2022
01:25:02,411 --> 01:25:03,640
about the difference.
No,

2023
01:25:03,641 --> 01:25:05,420
that moment,
no.

2024
01:25:05,421 --> 01:25:06,520
What was it?
What was it?

2025
01:25:06,550 --> 01:25:08,350
There was a,
there was espn,

2026
01:25:08,410 --> 01:25:09,243
espn you,
but it was the early days of the UFC 

2027
01:25:10,691 --> 01:25:12,430
where people didn't accept the UFC and 
there's,

2028
01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:15,580
that guy has actually become a ufc fan 
and,

2029
01:25:15,730 --> 01:25:18,400
but I think they had to realize that 
there's room for everybody.

2030
01:25:18,950 --> 01:25:20,170
Look,
I'm a boxing fan.

2031
01:25:20,171 --> 01:25:22,570
I've always been a boxing fan.
All of this.

2032
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:23,920
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.

2033
01:25:23,980 --> 01:25:24,813
My whole,
my whole life I've always been a boxing 

2034
01:25:26,561 --> 01:25:28,120
fan.
Can I say something about maxine?

2035
01:25:28,180 --> 01:25:29,013
Sure.
Whenever I hear the term pound for 

2036
01:25:30,011 --> 01:25:31,900
pound,
that term,

2037
01:25:32,050 --> 01:25:33,340
right?
All I think of,

2038
01:25:33,341 --> 01:25:33,641
no.
Okay.

2039
01:25:33,641 --> 01:25:37,300
That's a little guy.
I don't know.

2040
01:25:37,540 --> 01:25:38,700
Well,
whatever we're talking about,

2041
01:25:38,701 --> 01:25:39,534
see it's,
most people think it's Jon Jones and 

2042
01:25:41,321 --> 01:25:42,630
he's 205 pounds.
Oh,

2043
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:44,010
he is?
Okay.

2044
01:25:44,530 --> 01:25:45,363
Well he's around two 20 whenever.
Whenever I hear that term it's always 

2045
01:25:47,981 --> 01:25:48,610
like,
well,

2046
01:25:48,610 --> 01:25:49,443
they're dying little doll because most 
of the time during Roy Jones Jr day was 

2047
01:25:53,321 --> 01:25:57,160
him and he was a one 75 and he'd won the
heavyweight title.

2048
01:25:57,190 --> 01:26:00,400
He beat John Ruiz at heavyweight.
Roy Jones Jr.

2049
01:26:00,430 --> 01:26:01,360
Yes.
Yeah.

2050
01:26:01,890 --> 01:26:02,723
Anyways,
yeah.

2051
01:26:02,860 --> 01:26:04,220
I thought

2052
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:05,113
super middleweight,
which is one 68 he won the light 

2053
01:26:07,131 --> 01:26:10,340
heavyweight title.
He fought as divisions in mma.

2054
01:26:10,370 --> 01:26:11,860
Of course.
Same One,

2055
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:12,713
same number.
No,

2056
01:26:12,770 --> 01:26:14,330
not the silos.
Different numbers.

2057
01:26:14,331 --> 01:26:16,100
Same names.
It's very confusing.

2058
01:26:16,101 --> 01:26:16,934
Like welterweight welterweight and 
boxing is one 47 welterweight and mma 

2059
01:26:21,111 --> 01:26:24,680
it's one 70 yeah.
So those guys are just bigger.

2060
01:26:24,950 --> 01:26:28,100
It's just a different name because we 
have a one 45 weight class.

2061
01:26:28,101 --> 01:26:29,210
What's it called?
A featherweight.

2062
01:26:30,030 --> 01:26:31,910
Oh,
did they have an ultra featherweight?

2063
01:26:31,970 --> 01:26:32,803
No,
they have a bantamweight that mini 

2064
01:26:33,801 --> 01:26:34,670
federal.
Yeah.

2065
01:26:34,910 --> 01:26:36,530
Well,
they have a lightweight,

2066
01:26:36,531 --> 01:26:41,090
which is one 55 which is the small one.
55 in boxing would be super,

2067
01:26:41,330 --> 01:26:42,163
super lightweight or junior middleweight
or super welterweight or junior 

2068
01:26:44,721 --> 01:26:46,160
middleweight rather.
Interesting.

2069
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:49,850
Yeah.
It doesn't have weight classes in Bach,

2070
01:26:49,910 --> 01:26:50,743
in mma rather.
There's maybe people think there's too 

2071
01:26:52,851 --> 01:26:55,490
many and boxing,
which I don't have a problem with it.

2072
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:58,310
I like the fact there's a lot of weight 
classes cause it gives you a lot of guys

2073
01:26:58,311 --> 01:27:00,980
options and it gives guys options for 
championship and counters.

2074
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:04,700
But I think that the UFC could use more 
weight classes.

2075
01:27:04,701 --> 01:27:05,534
I think there should be a way class 
minimum every 10 pounds cause 10 pounds 

2076
01:27:08,510 --> 01:27:12,960
is that there's a big difference between
a one 70 pound guy on one 80 pound guy.

2077
01:27:12,961 --> 01:27:13,794
As far as strengths,
it's a big difference in what they can 

2078
01:27:15,981 --> 01:27:16,814
do.
How long before from the way in to the 

2079
01:27:22,701 --> 01:27:26,090
fight did they have to put on weight?
But it used to be 24 hours,

2080
01:27:26,091 --> 01:27:26,924
but now it's quite a bit more because 
now that you usually let them start 

2081
01:27:29,841 --> 01:27:33,110
early in the morning as early as a,
I believe 8:00

2082
01:27:33,110 --> 01:27:33,943
AM sometimes 10:00
AM so they have from 10 to noon to make 

2083
01:27:36,561 --> 01:27:38,640
weight now and the way in,
um,

2084
01:27:38,750 --> 01:27:41,780
now when we do the Wayne's,
I announced the winds Friday.

2085
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:42,910
I've always done that.
Yeah.

2086
01:27:43,220 --> 01:27:45,770
And I'm now,
it's the official weight.

2087
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:48,440
It's not the actual way and they don't 
actually get on the scale.

2088
01:27:48,441 --> 01:27:50,900
And then the way in the they,
they get on the scale.

2089
01:27:50,901 --> 01:27:52,520
It's more for show.
It's kind of stupid.

2090
01:27:52,521 --> 01:27:54,850
Did they get on a scale at all because 
they're hurting.

2091
01:27:54,860 --> 01:27:56,600
File already weighed in.
They've already waited.

2092
01:27:56,601 --> 01:27:57,790
They already waiting.
Yeah.

2093
01:27:57,800 --> 01:28:02,800
We probably shouldn't have them stand on
a scale and do this a nonsense.

2094
01:28:03,530 --> 01:28:04,363
It's really kind of foolish and I'm 
actually going to talk to them about 

2095
01:28:06,261 --> 01:28:09,380
maybe coming up with a better solution.
You need me to send an angry email?

2096
01:28:09,381 --> 01:28:10,214
What do you need me tweet off the 
fetterman account at federal people 

2097
01:28:14,091 --> 01:28:15,500
won't know it's you.
Yeah.

2098
01:28:15,780 --> 01:28:16,613
They're looking for Wayne Fetterman.
Who was this angry fetterman fetterman 

2099
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:21,770
who was furious at the,
sure.

2100
01:28:21,771 --> 01:28:22,604
Rod.
That is the way in which is like a 

2101
01:28:25,761 --> 01:28:27,920
charade when you're drunk off.
Shiraz.

2102
01:28:29,890 --> 01:28:32,180
This is a total,
sure rod.

2103
01:28:33,340 --> 01:28:35,930
God Damn sure Rod.
What's going on here?

2104
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:37,670
You could be indignant.
You'd be furious.

2105
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:40,670
Failed Way it all the time.
All the time.

2106
01:28:40,671 --> 01:28:41,504
What happens to that fight?
They either lose 20% of their purse to 

2107
01:28:45,111 --> 01:28:49,460
their opponent and the fight goes on or 
they cancel the fight.

2108
01:28:49,610 --> 01:28:52,850
And it depends entirely upon their 
opponent's choice.

2109
01:28:53,060 --> 01:28:54,830
Like it doesn't like,
there's a perfect example.

2110
01:28:55,100 --> 01:28:59,880
This past weekend is a guy named Ian 
Mccall and he knows his name fighting.

2111
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:00,591
You're good,
Justin.

2112
01:29:00,591 --> 01:29:02,160
Scoggins we're

2113
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:03,210
kidding.
I'm kidding.

2114
01:29:03,211 --> 01:29:04,380
This is my thing.
And get it.

2115
01:29:04,430 --> 01:29:06,180
Oh my God thing.
You're so silly.

2116
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:09,510
Um,
and scoggins was supposed to get down to

2117
01:29:09,511 --> 01:29:13,200
one 25 is a flyweight fight.
This is the lightest weight class in the

2118
01:29:13,201 --> 01:29:14,450
UFC.
Flies.

2119
01:29:14,460 --> 01:29:15,510
The lighter,
the lightest.

2120
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:17,970
Well,
there's a straw weight for women,

2121
01:29:18,030 --> 01:29:18,863
which would,
we just won 15 but there's not assuming 

2122
01:29:21,330 --> 01:29:22,880
strawweight division.
Millie.

2123
01:29:23,130 --> 01:29:25,920
Well,
women one 15 is not even the small size.

2124
01:29:25,921 --> 01:29:29,520
The name Straw,
like literally your pizza Straw.

2125
01:29:30,950 --> 01:29:34,470
I guess he never thought about it flies 
better than being strong.

2126
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:37,400
Is it better to be a fly then straw?
Alecia,

2127
01:29:37,410 --> 01:29:39,060
you have some this.
You're an insect.

2128
01:29:39,270 --> 01:29:42,200
He'd at least you have some fallout 
today are not moving.

2129
01:29:44,450 --> 01:29:45,283
Some farmer daughters Chilean on 
flirting with the guy from the gas 

2130
01:29:48,811 --> 01:29:50,190
stations.
I think about it.

2131
01:29:50,220 --> 01:29:51,840
That's how I think it's strong.
What do you think of that?

2132
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:57,020
I think that is wheat Ra.
What is straws?

2133
01:29:57,021 --> 01:29:59,040
Straws,
like grass that's been,

2134
01:29:59,280 --> 01:29:59,611
no,
that's,

2135
01:29:59,611 --> 01:30:02,110
hey,
right.

2136
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:04,620
Hey is when they take grass and they 
chop it down.

2137
01:30:04,621 --> 01:30:06,660
They roll it up and they feed it to 
cows,

2138
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:07,411
right?
That's,

2139
01:30:07,411 --> 01:30:11,140
Hey,
like Hay Bales Charlotte.

2140
01:30:11,260 --> 01:30:15,010
It is straw struggle with like there's 
little the same.

2141
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,370
Are they the same?
We're going to find out,

2142
01:30:17,430 --> 01:30:18,263
well,
you always see like wheat in someone's 

2143
01:30:19,980 --> 01:30:20,813
teeth.
I always think of wheat more is like a 

2144
01:30:22,291 --> 01:30:25,410
stock that has little flowers on it and 
that little,

2145
01:30:25,411 --> 01:30:27,150
I mean straws,
a stock,

2146
01:30:27,300 --> 01:30:29,040
usually a waste product of wheat.
Oh,

2147
01:30:29,041 --> 01:30:29,874
okay.
It's the same thing I guess that's used 

2148
01:30:31,381 --> 01:30:34,770
as a bedding for barnyard animals.
It's the waste product.

2149
01:30:34,770 --> 01:30:36,410
Interesting.
So the straws,

2150
01:30:36,420 --> 01:30:37,253
the part that you don't use hay is 
typically Alfalfa or grass that is used 

2151
01:30:41,341 --> 01:30:43,650
as animal feed.
Interesting.

2152
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:45,960
Okay.
Now I know cause I strawn.

2153
01:30:45,961 --> 01:30:47,760
Hey,
I said would you rather be again,

2154
01:30:47,761 --> 01:30:49,300
let's go back to your question that you 
pose.

2155
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:50,280
Fuck about names,
Bro.

2156
01:30:50,790 --> 01:30:52,620
I don't care.
Straw fly gives a shit.

2157
01:30:52,650 --> 01:30:53,940
Honestly,
I think no names.

2158
01:30:54,150 --> 01:30:55,880
I think one or two numbers.
Yeah,

2159
01:30:55,890 --> 01:30:58,470
I agree with that.
He's the 155 pound champion.

2160
01:30:58,471 --> 01:30:59,760
That's what I think.
Very clear.

2161
01:30:59,790 --> 01:31:02,220
Everyone will know.
I don't like the welter weight.

2162
01:31:02,310 --> 01:31:05,140
I'm going to fire up a navy senator.
Wait,

2163
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:06,710
come on.
Crude heavyweight.

2164
01:31:06,940 --> 01:31:08,520
You know,
here's another interesting thing.

2165
01:31:08,580 --> 01:31:09,413
Heavyweight has a weight limit.
You can't be heavier than 265 pounds in 

2166
01:31:12,721 --> 01:31:16,500
boxing in the UFC because we don't have 
a super heavyweight division.

2167
01:31:16,620 --> 01:31:17,453
We have a heavyweight division,
he goes up to two 65 and that's what's 

2168
01:31:19,921 --> 01:31:20,754
sanctioned.

2169
01:31:21,090 --> 01:31:23,780
And then from to 65 on up is super 
heavyweight,

2170
01:31:23,790 --> 01:31:28,110
but the UFC does not have and has never 
had a super heavyweight division.

2171
01:31:28,140 --> 01:31:29,730
They didn't want to see those guys that 
are not,

2172
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:31,080
just never had it.
Well,

2173
01:31:31,081 --> 01:31:32,970
it doesn't,
they don't have to be like fat.

2174
01:31:32,971 --> 01:31:33,804
You made the fat gesture and I did.
They could easily be just giant like 

2175
01:31:36,511 --> 01:31:37,580
brock lesnar.
Yeah.

2176
01:31:38,070 --> 01:31:39,300
As to suck.
Wait,

2177
01:31:39,301 --> 01:31:42,570
he has to dehydrate himself to make the 
265 pound weight limit.

2178
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:45,300
My how much did a little,
well,

2179
01:31:45,330 --> 01:31:46,950
you know Lebron,
this is basketball.

2180
01:31:46,951 --> 01:31:48,030
The sport.
You don't know.

2181
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:49,590
He's an athlete,
right?

2182
01:31:50,430 --> 01:31:52,620
That I've seen him anything.
He has sneakers.

2183
01:31:52,630 --> 01:31:54,120
Jamie,
how many do you think he weighs?

2184
01:31:54,420 --> 01:31:59,100
300 pounds.
Weight ever to 70 to 70 75 huge.

2185
01:31:59,360 --> 01:31:59,980
All right.
I guess

2186
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:01,690
he could have somebody that says,
yeah,

2187
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:05,400
I'm super heavyweight.
Yeah,

2188
01:32:05,610 --> 01:32:07,030
I do fat guys.
Yeah,

2189
01:32:07,780 --> 01:32:11,500
but remember that Guy Butterball is that
him let her being,

2190
01:32:11,501 --> 01:32:12,760
what was his thing?
He just died,

2191
01:32:12,761 --> 01:32:13,720
right?
No,

2192
01:32:13,721 --> 01:32:14,740
he's alive.
He is.

2193
01:32:15,510 --> 01:32:16,343
He's fat as fuck,
but it's like a bouncer or something 

2194
01:32:18,071 --> 01:32:20,080
that became a,
um,

2195
01:32:20,081 --> 01:32:23,530
well I don't know what his deal was.
I know he's a cook.

2196
01:32:24,420 --> 01:32:26,650
They'll eat like supposed to be really 
good at cooking pork chops.

2197
01:32:26,660 --> 01:32:29,410
No,
in mma for awhile while boxing,

2198
01:32:30,430 --> 01:32:31,570
kickboxing,
Hudson,

2199
01:32:31,571 --> 01:32:36,571
some kickboxing fights.
So can I go back to your last fight?

2200
01:32:37,870 --> 01:32:38,400
Yeah,
sure.

2201
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:39,233
Cause I'm really curious,
but just as somebody who's like afraid 

2202
01:32:40,871 --> 01:32:41,770
of fighting,
so,

2203
01:32:41,771 --> 01:32:45,250
and we'll just curious about it like you
get hit,

2204
01:32:46,180 --> 01:32:48,610
did you think you are winning at the 
time was definitely winning?

2205
01:32:48,630 --> 01:32:49,480
Yeah.
Oh No,

2206
01:32:49,490 --> 01:32:53,830
you're winning like a short story.
I fought three times that day.

2207
01:32:54,190 --> 01:32:56,680
That was part of the problem.
But there was two problems.

2208
01:32:57,010 --> 01:33:00,430
One of the problems was that you know 
the exact date?

2209
01:33:00,490 --> 01:33:01,690
No,
I don't.

2210
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:04,810
Okay.
One of the problems was that I was doing

2211
01:33:04,811 --> 01:33:05,644
comedy at the time and I was working 
full time and in Boston and it was 

2212
01:33:09,581 --> 01:33:10,414
trying to figure out what I was doing 
with my life and I was not nearly as 

2213
01:33:12,401 --> 01:33:15,940
dedicated as I was to fighting just a 
few years before that.

2214
01:33:15,941 --> 01:33:16,774
And I was 21 on my way to 22.
I might've been 22 at the time or maybe 

2215
01:33:21,011 --> 01:33:25,000
a month or two before it turned 22 and 
that's when I decided I was done because

2216
01:33:25,001 --> 01:33:26,680
I was,
I knew I was half assing it.

2217
01:33:27,130 --> 01:33:27,963
And uh,
I just wasn't training as hard as I was 

2218
01:33:30,971 --> 01:33:31,804
just a couple of years ago when I was 
fighting and competing and I was 

2219
01:33:33,710 --> 01:33:34,543
throwing Massachusetts state champion 
and I was competing in national 

2220
01:33:37,061 --> 01:33:38,560
tournaments and traveling all over the 
country,

2221
01:33:38,950 --> 01:33:40,990
I'd realize that it was a dead end.

2222
01:33:41,020 --> 01:33:45,070
And then I had put an incredible amount 
of time and effort into something,

2223
01:33:45,071 --> 01:33:48,020
even at its best case scenario.
There was no money in it.

2224
01:33:48,910 --> 01:33:52,900
And then I'd go,
I'd also had a problem in that I started

2225
01:33:52,901 --> 01:33:53,734
competing in taekwondo,
which was a mostly a kicking art and 

2226
01:33:57,791 --> 01:34:00,490
very little hand techniques.
And then I went from taekwondo.

2227
01:34:00,491 --> 01:34:01,324
I started training at a boxing gym and I
realized that I really needed a massive 

2228
01:34:04,811 --> 01:34:05,644
amount of work on my hands.
And so I started boxing and I was 

2229
01:34:08,261 --> 01:34:11,260
getting beat up a lot.
Like I was,

2230
01:34:11,261 --> 01:34:14,350
I was having wars in the gym and I 
wasn't always winning.

2231
01:34:14,770 --> 01:34:16,110
And uh,
I was kidding.

2232
01:34:16,120 --> 01:34:19,870
We just slid down in these wars you're 
having and you're getting beat up,

2233
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:22,150
just beat up.
You're getting beat.

2234
01:34:22,220 --> 01:34:23,610
Okay.
You get punched in the face,

2235
01:34:23,611 --> 01:34:26,170
you're getting punched in the face.
And we all know that great Tyson thing.

2236
01:34:26,170 --> 01:34:28,960
Everyone has a plan until someone 
punching in the face.

2237
01:34:29,450 --> 01:34:33,460
Uh,
like what's going through your head?

2238
01:34:33,461 --> 01:34:35,180
Is it just like,
keep moving,

2239
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:37,210
Throw Your Jab,
move your head,

2240
01:34:37,211 --> 01:34:39,460
don't get hit as much.
Move your feet,

2241
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:42,280
use your foot work.
Don't stand in the pocket.

2242
01:34:42,810 --> 01:34:44,410
Tees up all technique.
Yeah,

2243
01:34:44,411 --> 01:34:45,340
I mean,
you're sparring.

2244
01:34:45,430 --> 01:34:47,140
You know,
what I was doing was I was,

2245
01:34:47,310 --> 01:34:50,350
there was a guy named Joe Lake who was 
my boxing coach who was a,

2246
01:34:50,650 --> 01:34:51,483
this is what happened.
I was working at this place called 

2247
01:34:53,891 --> 01:34:56,440
Nautilus plus in revere,
Massachusetts.

2248
01:34:56,441 --> 01:34:59,810
They had this section of this gym that 
we had rented out,

2249
01:34:59,870 --> 01:35:02,210
right?
This big room that we had rented out.

2250
01:35:02,211 --> 01:35:04,700
And I had started teaching taekwondo 
classes there.

2251
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:05,953
And so I would go out and put out flyers
and I would teach classes and I also 

2252
01:35:08,571 --> 01:35:13,340
taught at Boston University.
I had my own classes at bu and flyered.

2253
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:14,510
Yeah,
put flyers up.

2254
01:35:15,020 --> 01:35:16,880
Did you ever do flyers for comedy?
No.

2255
01:35:17,060 --> 01:35:17,893
Never did flies for comedy.
Did you ever stand outside of Chlamydia 

2256
01:35:19,911 --> 01:35:20,690
club?
No,

2257
01:35:20,690 --> 01:35:21,680
never did that.
I needed it.

2258
01:35:21,860 --> 01:35:24,140
But I know that's a New York thing.
That's a New York thing.

2259
01:35:24,141 --> 01:35:25,060
Yeah,
they stand down.

2260
01:35:25,070 --> 01:35:25,903
They kept,
there's so much foot traffic trying to 

2261
01:35:26,841 --> 01:35:29,630
get people to go to the seller.
It's just funny.

2262
01:35:29,631 --> 01:35:32,240
It's just like if all the Comedians I've
known that are like or band,

2263
01:35:32,241 --> 01:35:33,074
you know,
you would hear about these bands in the 

2264
01:35:33,771 --> 01:35:35,690
eighties starting out and I had to put 
up flyers,

2265
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:38,510
flyers and then you are doing it for a 
Tae Kwon.

2266
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:39,440
Dell?
Yeah,

2267
01:35:39,441 --> 01:35:42,200
I was doing it for lessons or lesson or 
like,

2268
01:35:42,201 --> 01:35:43,034
uh,
I think there was like a photo of 

2269
01:35:45,231 --> 01:35:47,210
someone throwing a side kick or 
something like that.

2270
01:35:47,211 --> 01:35:48,260
And it would be,
you know,

2271
01:35:48,261 --> 01:35:53,030
the name of the gym and the phone number
for the school where you could go call.

2272
01:35:53,030 --> 01:35:55,010
And,
and did it have your name?

2273
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:56,390
Yeah,
my name,

2274
01:35:56,391 --> 01:35:57,340
no nickname.
Rogan.

2275
01:35:57,400 --> 01:35:58,430
No,
no nickname.

2276
01:35:58,431 --> 01:36:01,850
It just had my credentials and my,
you know,

2277
01:36:02,240 --> 01:36:03,073
black belt and all that jazz for time.
Massachusetts state taekwondo champion 

2278
01:36:06,951 --> 01:36:09,800
and won the US Open and all this and 
stuff.

2279
01:36:10,090 --> 01:36:11,640
Yeah,
I've got a bunch of that shit today.

2280
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:13,950
Metals in my closet.
Everything is in the class.

2281
01:36:14,350 --> 01:36:16,540
Just hanging around,
you know,

2282
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:19,470
what am I going to do with them?
I've never want to,

2283
01:36:19,550 --> 01:36:21,830
you know,
a boxing or a taekwondo.

2284
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:23,740
Everyone.
All right.

2285
01:36:23,830 --> 01:36:28,160
And he's anger is starting to hurt me.
I don't know why you're attacking me.

2286
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:30,100
We were having a pretty good time here,
weren't we?

2287
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:32,330
I don't think I'm attacking me.
I think you're super sensitive.

2288
01:36:32,420 --> 01:36:34,540
I am.
I am a sensitive guy.

2289
01:36:34,950 --> 01:36:37,170
Uh,
um,

2290
01:36:37,220 --> 01:36:38,990
yeah.
I have a couple of sports stroke,

2291
01:36:39,050 --> 01:36:40,670
football trophies from when I was a kid.

2292
01:36:40,670 --> 01:36:41,503
Yeah.
Okay.

2293
01:36:41,930 --> 01:36:46,310
On a team,
but not an individual like this.

2294
01:36:46,460 --> 01:36:48,500
I,
that's what I didn't like about teams.

2295
01:36:48,670 --> 01:36:49,503
Again,
I didn't like the idea that we all one 

2296
01:36:51,231 --> 01:36:53,060
together.
I was very selfish.

2297
01:36:53,330 --> 01:36:56,540
I wanted to win and I didn't also like 
the idea that we lost,

2298
01:36:56,541 --> 01:37:01,541
cause bobby dropped the ball and now I'm
a loser because bobby's a fucking Klutz.

2299
01:37:01,731 --> 01:37:03,460
I'm a loser like that.
Okay.

2300
01:37:04,250 --> 01:37:06,050
So why?
Anyway,

2301
01:37:06,110 --> 01:37:08,360
I went from,
I'm teaching,

2302
01:37:08,450 --> 01:37:10,250
I was teaching at this class and this 
guy,

2303
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:12,680
Joe Lake was a friend of mine who was a 
boxer.

2304
01:37:12,840 --> 01:37:15,170
He was a professional boxer and his 
boxing coach,

2305
01:37:15,171 --> 01:37:17,420
he taught a lot of pro boxers in the 
area.

2306
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:18,673
He came in and was watching me work out 
and he wanted to learn some kicks and 

2307
01:37:22,911 --> 01:37:25,250
we,
we started talking and found out I was a

2308
01:37:25,251 --> 01:37:26,084
boxing fan.
We started talking about boxing and he 

2309
01:37:28,280 --> 01:37:30,710
told me what he does and he said,
uh,

2310
01:37:30,711 --> 01:37:31,191
you know,
hey,

2311
01:37:31,191 --> 01:37:32,250
how about we make a deal,
you know,

2312
01:37:32,270 --> 01:37:33,103
teach you some boxing,
you teach me some kicking and I'm 

2313
01:37:34,461 --> 01:37:35,294
sending it,
love it.

2314
01:37:35,390 --> 01:37:36,223
So when I started learning from him,
he's a great coach and teach me boxing 

2315
01:37:39,711 --> 01:37:40,544
techniques and stuff like that.
I started realizing how little I knew 

2316
01:37:43,401 --> 01:37:44,234
about combining boxing and kicking 
together and also how little I knew 

2317
01:37:48,081 --> 01:37:48,914
about really like getting hit and 
rolling with punches and I just was 

2318
01:37:52,071 --> 01:37:53,960
missing that aspect of,
of,

2319
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:55,033
of fighting.
So I started doing it and as I started 

2320
01:37:57,961 --> 01:37:58,830
doing it,
um,

2321
01:37:58,920 --> 01:38:02,460
and I competed and I started doing a lot
of sparring,

2322
01:38:02,820 --> 01:38:03,653
I started realizing that what I 
dedicated all my time to taekwondo was 

2323
01:38:06,691 --> 01:38:07,524
limited in a lot of ways.
Like without learning how to throw 

2324
01:38:09,541 --> 01:38:11,280
punches,
it was like a real problem with it.

2325
01:38:11,281 --> 01:38:15,450
So I kind of knew that I was not going 
to compete in taekwondo anymore.

2326
01:38:15,510 --> 01:38:16,650
I kind of knew like,
wow,

2327
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:17,633
this is sort of opened up my eyes to the
fact that taekwondo is very limited and 

2328
01:38:21,241 --> 01:38:22,620
there was no mma back then.

2329
01:38:22,620 --> 01:38:25,920
So like taekwondo you see in mma a lot.
There was no,

2330
01:38:25,980 --> 01:38:27,600
I'm not very happy with everything 
turned the way,

2331
01:38:27,610 --> 01:38:29,430
everything,
but I'm just like,

2332
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:29,790
no,
no,

2333
01:38:29,790 --> 01:38:31,920
no to tiff tested yourself and that kind
of,

2334
01:38:31,980 --> 01:38:32,813
I would have for sure 100%,
but like I would have definitely done 

2335
01:38:35,731 --> 01:38:36,780
it.
I mean,

2336
01:38:36,810 --> 01:38:39,150
I did kickboxing because I wanted to 
find out about that.

2337
01:38:39,151 --> 01:38:41,400
I did taekwondo because I wanted to find
out about that.

2338
01:38:41,730 --> 01:38:44,100
I fought in karate tournaments.
I did a lot of different stuff because I

2339
01:38:44,101 --> 01:38:46,100
just wanted to see what it was like.
Um,

2340
01:38:46,230 --> 01:38:49,680
but if mma was around,
I would have realized that,

2341
01:38:49,681 --> 01:38:51,600
well,
all this stuff is all fine and dandy,

2342
01:38:51,601 --> 01:38:52,434
all this kicking and punching.
But if somebody takes you down and then 

2343
01:38:53,611 --> 01:38:55,470
when are you going to do,
I would've realized then,

2344
01:38:55,471 --> 01:38:57,750
and that's one of the reasons why when I
came to La,

2345
01:38:57,990 --> 01:38:59,550
I immediately got into Jujitsu.

2346
01:38:59,940 --> 01:39:00,773
So I started taking Jujitsu in 1996 and 
the reason why I started taking it was 

2347
01:39:03,601 --> 01:39:07,120
because of watching the UFC and seeing 
guys take guys the ground,

2348
01:39:07,121 --> 01:39:10,140
seeing hoists,
gracie dominate guys and try to come and

2349
01:39:10,141 --> 01:39:11,520
tap them.
And I realized,

2350
01:39:11,550 --> 01:39:12,091
Oh,
okay,

2351
01:39:12,091 --> 01:39:14,550
I got to learn this stuff.
This is some totally different stuff.

2352
01:39:14,580 --> 01:39:15,413
And I kind of caught the wave,
like I got into it as a traditional 

2353
01:39:19,471 --> 01:39:20,304
martial artists as a taekwondo 
practitioner and then went from that 

2354
01:39:22,921 --> 01:39:27,780
into all these other martial arts that I
had kind of like sort of assimilated and

2355
01:39:27,781 --> 01:39:28,614
plus I was a big Bruce Lee fan and that 
was one of the things that Bruce Lee 

2356
01:39:31,531 --> 01:39:33,400
subscribed to [inaudible].
He was the,

2357
01:39:33,690 --> 01:39:34,523
he was the first proponent of mixing and
integrating different styles together 

2358
01:39:38,160 --> 01:39:38,993
and his g coon dos style was that it was
entirely the philosophy as a style 

2359
01:39:44,050 --> 01:39:47,400
absorb what's useful,
take all the useful aspects of different

2360
01:39:47,401 --> 01:39:48,600
martial arts and apply them.

2361
01:39:48,820 --> 01:39:51,480
I saw like that could almost apply to 
bigger things in life.

2362
01:39:51,570 --> 01:39:52,530
Oh for sure.
Of course.

2363
01:39:52,531 --> 01:39:53,364
Yeah,
and also the limitations of not doing 

2364
01:39:55,021 --> 01:40:00,021
that apply the limitations of being very
rigid idea in your life.

2365
01:40:01,260 --> 01:40:02,130
Definitely.
Yeah,

2366
01:40:02,131 --> 01:40:02,964
for sure.
Because this is a lot of people that 

2367
01:40:03,691 --> 01:40:04,680
want to think that,
you know,

2368
01:40:04,681 --> 01:40:08,400
what they do is the only way,
like people that are on like windows for

2369
01:40:08,401 --> 01:40:09,800
instance,
some people are just like,

2370
01:40:09,830 --> 01:40:11,730
I'll never use it back.
You know?

2371
01:40:11,731 --> 01:40:12,960
Or there's,
there's people that are,

2372
01:40:12,961 --> 01:40:14,490
I'm a Democrat till I die,
Bro.

2373
01:40:14,790 --> 01:40:16,080
Oh fuck.
A registered Democrat.

2374
01:40:16,081 --> 01:40:16,914
You know,
there's a lot of people that will get 

2375
01:40:17,491 --> 01:40:19,650
real rigid with their,
I don't know what the evidence,

2376
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:21,900
no matter exactly,
information comes their way,

2377
01:40:21,901 --> 01:40:23,190
not interested.
Yeah.

2378
01:40:23,410 --> 01:40:24,243
Yeah.
Dan to that applies because there was a 

2379
01:40:26,221 --> 01:40:27,054
lot of blowback or a lot of push back 
when I was doing taekwondo and then I 

2380
01:40:30,481 --> 01:40:33,870
started boxing when I started really 
getting involved in boxing.

2381
01:40:33,871 --> 01:40:34,704
Wait,
there were people that didn't want you 

2382
01:40:35,311 --> 01:40:36,360
to do it?
Absolutely.

2383
01:40:36,420 --> 01:40:38,610
Yeah.
They've felt like it was an argument.

2384
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:40,350
I didn't need to,
I was wasting my time.

2385
01:40:40,351 --> 01:40:42,600
I was taking away time from my taekwondo
training.

2386
01:40:42,630 --> 01:40:44,810
It was a waste.
And a,

2387
01:40:44,850 --> 01:40:45,683
one of the things that helped me is that
I started opening up my own school and 

2388
01:40:47,851 --> 01:40:49,590
when I opened up my own school in 
revere,

2389
01:40:49,810 --> 01:40:51,870
um,
I was away from my instructors.

2390
01:40:51,900 --> 01:40:54,250
So I got a chance to train on my own

2391
01:40:54,430 --> 01:40:56,230
and I'd got a chance to bring in other 
people.

2392
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:57,153
And that's when I really started to 
expand my ideas about what I needed to 

2393
01:40:59,741 --> 01:41:00,470
do.
What,

2394
01:41:00,470 --> 01:41:03,670
what was and what wasn't effective.
And I had a good buddy of mine who would

2395
01:41:03,671 --> 01:41:05,890
also,
my friend Mike [inaudible] who had had a

2396
01:41:05,891 --> 01:41:09,250
some pro boxing fights and we did some 
sparring together and he beat me up too.

2397
01:41:09,700 --> 01:41:11,530
And so I kind of realized like,
Oh man,

2398
01:41:11,531 --> 01:41:12,920
I got to,
there's some stuff I need,

2399
01:41:12,940 --> 01:41:16,960
I need to figure out how to incorporate.
Now that's the,

2400
01:41:17,290 --> 01:41:19,390
well first of all brings up a million 
questions.

2401
01:41:19,391 --> 01:41:22,450
But back to my original question about 
getting beat up,

2402
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:28,280
like just as someone who has the flight 
reflex right when someone's coming at me

2403
01:41:30,280 --> 01:41:32,990
like that's my reflex as opposed to oh 
brush it off,

2404
01:41:33,010 --> 01:41:35,620
move lane fleet and stuff like that.
I'm always does that,

2405
01:41:35,740 --> 01:41:38,770
did that ever appear where you're just 
like fuck,

2406
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:39,633
I got a,
I'm getting pummeled while I was never 

2407
01:41:42,131 --> 01:41:42,570
getting pumped.

2408
01:41:42,570 --> 01:41:45,730
Like I'm to just talking them.
I like emotionally wasn't no,

2409
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:47,440
cause it wasn't like I didn't have a 
chance.

2410
01:41:47,441 --> 01:41:49,990
It was like I was just losing,
it wasn't winning.

2411
01:41:50,050 --> 01:41:50,883
Okay.
I know,

2412
01:41:50,890 --> 01:41:51,723
but I was getting shots in like there 
was guys that were pro boxers that I 

2413
01:41:54,131 --> 01:41:56,500
knocked out in the gym.
So it wasn't that I was,

2414
01:41:56,740 --> 01:41:57,573
I gadget 100% losing,
but I definitely wasn't winning like I 

2415
01:41:59,801 --> 01:42:02,170
was winning and taekwondo tournament's 
in taekwondo.

2416
01:42:02,230 --> 01:42:05,710
Was that a real national class level?
I must like I was beating.

2417
01:42:05,711 --> 01:42:06,940
Yeah,
but that's the problem.

2418
01:42:06,941 --> 01:42:08,530
When you're really good at something,
you want to stick to.

2419
01:42:08,531 --> 01:42:09,364
Only that.
We don't want to test the waters with 

2420
01:42:12,221 --> 01:42:14,690
things that you're not good at.
You don't know in a weird way.

2421
01:42:14,691 --> 01:42:16,870
Horrible.
Can I draw a parallel to stand up?

2422
01:42:16,990 --> 01:42:19,480
Sure.
Cause a lot of times like you get really

2423
01:42:19,481 --> 01:42:21,070
good,
you develop a bit,

2424
01:42:21,550 --> 01:42:23,920
you want to do,
it kills you feel good.

2425
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:25,540
People are flirting with you after the 
show.

2426
01:42:25,541 --> 01:42:26,770
It's a whole Ms.
Flirt with you.

2427
01:42:27,100 --> 01:42:29,830
What's going on?
Chicks coming up to you.

2428
01:42:29,910 --> 01:42:31,720
[inaudible] a lot of action.
Fetterman.

2429
01:42:31,721 --> 01:42:32,920
Yeah,
that's my moves.

2430
01:42:32,921 --> 01:42:33,850
Nice.
So,

2431
01:42:33,851 --> 01:42:36,220
uh,
but then again,

2432
01:42:36,250 --> 01:42:39,590
hypothetical,
totally hypothetical.

2433
01:42:39,970 --> 01:42:43,150
Uh,
but then if you want to expand your act,

2434
01:42:43,151 --> 01:42:43,984
you have to try out new stuff and that 
undercut this invincible standup 

2435
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:52,300
comedian imaged it.
It's so popular.

2436
01:42:52,540 --> 01:42:54,070
It was so wonderful.
Oh yeah.

2437
01:42:54,130 --> 01:42:57,550
So I feel like there,
do you think that's a valid parallel?

2438
01:42:57,600 --> 01:42:58,480
Yeah,
for sure.

2439
01:42:58,481 --> 01:42:59,560
Definitely.
Yeah.

2440
01:42:59,590 --> 01:43:00,423
Yeah,
definitely.

2441
01:43:00,440 --> 01:43:01,273
Well,
I think that's also other things in 

2442
01:43:02,261 --> 01:43:03,094
life.
I love doing things that I'm not good 

2443
01:43:03,971 --> 01:43:04,804
at.
Like one of the things I'm really into 

2444
01:43:05,391 --> 01:43:06,330
casting.
Yeah.

2445
01:43:06,580 --> 01:43:10,090
Perfect example.
Thinks a mid to lately is yoga.

2446
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:13,330
I'm not good at it.
I've been doing it for a year,

2447
01:43:13,331 --> 01:43:14,750
like really solid.
Uh,

2448
01:43:14,770 --> 01:43:16,450
what time do you do it in the mornings?

2449
01:43:17,140 --> 01:43:19,210
You just said you worked out hard in the
morning.

2450
01:43:19,250 --> 01:43:20,730
Yeah.
And then he goes,

2451
01:43:20,740 --> 01:43:23,050
I do yoga today.
I did kickboxing.

2452
01:43:23,090 --> 01:43:24,670
Yeah.
Tomorrow I'm going to do yoga.

2453
01:43:25,120 --> 01:43:26,250
I do yoga.
Different days.

2454
01:43:26,270 --> 01:43:31,270
Your best moves pose.
Bestfest I'm going to guess,

2455
01:43:32,700 --> 01:43:37,700
I'm going to guess it's,
I'm laughing what?

2456
01:43:38,980 --> 01:43:41,200
You're making those,
the laughing princess.

2457
01:43:41,290 --> 01:43:42,101
Do you do that one?
Fuck.

2458
01:43:42,101 --> 01:43:42,934
Is that,
that's,

2459
01:43:43,130 --> 01:43:44,740
that's the hardest one.
I don't even know what you're talking.

2460
01:43:44,750 --> 01:43:45,760
I don't want it.
He made it up.

2461
01:43:45,790 --> 01:43:46,623
Yeah.
Yeah.

2462
01:43:46,780 --> 01:43:48,690
You knew that since they started.
I don't know.

2463
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:50,160
It might be laughing.
Prince House.

2464
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:51,470
There's a lot of moves.
I don't know,

2465
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:54,770
but it's difficult.
It's basically hot,

2466
01:43:54,830 --> 01:43:56,210
hot yoga.
I really like.

2467
01:43:56,330 --> 01:43:59,230
Oh,
cause it's brutal and it's also requires

2468
01:43:59,231 --> 01:44:01,130
and a mental toughness.
Same as big room.

2469
01:44:01,190 --> 01:44:01,770
Yeah.
Yeah.

2470
01:44:01,770 --> 01:44:02,541
Same thing.
Okay.

2471
01:44:02,541 --> 01:44:03,340
Yeah.
How hot.

2472
01:44:03,340 --> 01:44:05,420
That's where I didn't it 104 degrees.

2473
01:44:05,450 --> 01:44:08,600
Do you do it any justice in this?
If this is too personal,

2474
01:44:08,601 --> 01:44:10,820
just say Wayne back off.
Just say,

2475
01:44:10,821 --> 01:44:11,760
Wayne,
this is overlying.

2476
01:44:11,770 --> 01:44:13,790
Okay.
Do you do this over the line?

2477
01:44:13,810 --> 01:44:14,643
Okay.
I know it.

2478
01:44:14,940 --> 01:44:15,890
No,
I'm very probing.

2479
01:44:17,080 --> 01:44:17,913
We'll move onto another thing.
It's part of the hot yoga to lose 

2480
01:44:23,151 --> 01:44:24,000
weight.
No,

2481
01:44:24,001 --> 01:44:24,860
as well.
No,

2482
01:44:24,890 --> 01:44:25,940
none of it.
No.

2483
01:44:26,060 --> 01:44:28,820
None of them.
It's all just for the just exercise.

2484
01:44:28,850 --> 01:44:29,480
All right.
Yeah.

2485
01:44:29,480 --> 01:44:31,490
I mean you definitely will lose weight 
if you do it.

2486
01:44:31,491 --> 01:44:34,820
It's 90 minutes of exertion is a lot of 
calories being burned for sure.

2487
01:44:34,850 --> 01:44:36,920
How hot is it in there?
104 degrees,

2488
01:44:37,100 --> 01:44:37,933
but it's also 104 degrees and then 
you're exercising and there's 50 other 

2489
01:44:40,491 --> 01:44:43,040
people in the room and they're all 
sweating like pigs smell good.

2490
01:44:43,041 --> 01:44:44,130
It's fucking hot.
Nuts.

2491
01:44:44,160 --> 01:44:46,460
Smells terrible sometimes.
Is that the hardest part?

2492
01:44:46,490 --> 01:44:47,301
No smell?
No.

2493
01:44:47,301 --> 01:44:49,190
The hardest part is mental.

2494
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:50,660
Well,
here's the hardest part.

2495
01:44:50,980 --> 01:44:53,060
You,
it never is going to be easy.

2496
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:53,953
You will always put a hundred percent 
effort into each and every individual 

2497
01:44:57,771 --> 01:44:58,604
posts so it will never know less.
It will never be less than a hundred 

2498
01:45:01,971 --> 01:45:04,520
percent effort.
So it will always be difficult.

2499
01:45:04,580 --> 01:45:07,220
You will get better and maintaining 
those poses,

2500
01:45:07,221 --> 01:45:09,050
you will get better at your range of 
motion.

2501
01:45:09,260 --> 01:45:11,870
You'll get better at your ability to 
hold positions,

2502
01:45:12,140 --> 01:45:14,840
but it will never be easy.
It's always going to be hard.

2503
01:45:15,410 --> 01:45:16,490
90 minutes.
Yup.

2504
01:45:16,820 --> 01:45:21,020
90 minutes sweating like a fucking like 
how does it end?

2505
01:45:21,021 --> 01:45:24,740
How does it analyze their ldl?
Is there a bell and they just go,

2506
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:26,980
that's end.
They say Namaz Day.

2507
01:45:27,210 --> 01:45:29,960
What'd you say?
Newmont stay back non ironically.

2508
01:45:31,070 --> 01:45:33,230
And you're fine with that.
That's a comedian.

2509
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:34,880
Yeah,
you do it.

2510
01:45:35,020 --> 01:45:36,110
You do that?
No you don't.

2511
01:45:36,260 --> 01:45:38,620
I don't do that with my hands,
but I would if I had to it.

2512
01:45:38,990 --> 01:45:40,050
Why not if I meant it.

2513
01:45:42,070 --> 01:45:44,450
Uh,
I hate yoga.

2514
01:45:44,540 --> 01:45:45,520
That's the president.
Yeah.

2515
01:45:45,560 --> 01:45:48,080
But I'm not good at it.
That's why one of the reasons why I like

2516
01:45:48,081 --> 01:45:48,914
it,
I like doing things that I need to get 

2517
01:45:50,241 --> 01:45:52,190
better at and like you see your 
progress.

2518
01:45:52,191 --> 01:45:54,200
I know I'm better at it now than it was 
a year ago.

2519
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:56,540
And if I continue to do it,
I'll get better at it.

2520
01:45:57,290 --> 01:46:00,130
It's just a challenge.
Gel.

2521
01:46:00,470 --> 01:46:02,600
We've known each other long time.
We're not long time.

2522
01:46:03,020 --> 01:46:04,500
We're not close friends.
We could be.

2523
01:46:05,960 --> 01:46:06,830
Thank you.
Thank you.

2524
01:46:06,831 --> 01:46:08,330
Very smart guy.
That's nice.

2525
01:46:08,670 --> 01:46:10,100
Uh,
yeah,

2526
01:46:10,130 --> 01:46:13,610
but I am also on a lifetime self 
improvement program.

2527
01:46:13,640 --> 01:46:14,473
Yeah.
Yeah.

2528
01:46:14,630 --> 01:46:16,220
No question.
What kind of stuff are you into?

2529
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,190
Well,
one cold yoga.

2530
01:46:19,310 --> 01:46:21,680
Have you tried that deep due to the 
snow,

2531
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:27,400
now we do it naked and ice cube.
A lot of people don't know it.

2532
01:46:27,680 --> 01:46:28,970
I do call it yoga.

2533
01:46:29,120 --> 01:46:30,020
I do,
uh,

2534
01:46:30,940 --> 01:46:32,720
I,
while I try to,

2535
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:34,970
you know,
I'm always teaching myself,

2536
01:46:35,210 --> 01:46:36,043
reading a lot,
teaching myself instruments all the 

2537
01:46:38,031 --> 01:46:38,864
time.
I like that you're really into musical 

2538
01:46:40,100 --> 01:46:41,180
ones,
really into music.

2539
01:46:41,181 --> 01:46:44,540
Many different musical instruments.
You know how to do well.

2540
01:46:44,920 --> 01:46:47,020
Play is the word,
but it's um,

2541
01:46:47,540 --> 01:46:50,220
how many do you saying,
how many of those things do you sing?

2542
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:55,410
Yeah,
I know it's the,

2543
01:46:55,890 --> 01:46:56,880
you know,
a few.

2544
01:46:56,910 --> 01:47:00,420
Just mainly how many gay ones if that 
half,

2545
01:47:00,440 --> 01:47:02,190
but out piano,
Guitar,

2546
01:47:02,250 --> 01:47:03,090
Bass,
Guitar,

2547
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:06,510
getting back into drums.
Are you one of the reasons why there's a

2548
01:47:06,511 --> 01:47:09,180
piano on stage at the Improv that I need
to take that fucking thing down?

2549
01:47:09,210 --> 01:47:10,050
No,
we need to do,

2550
01:47:10,110 --> 01:47:10,943
we needed another one dueling pianos.
Like they could have another room maybe 

2551
01:47:13,921 --> 01:47:15,840
with a piano,
but the piano just gets in the way.

2552
01:47:15,850 --> 01:47:19,200
The stage,
it's not used for 9.9%

2553
01:47:19,201 --> 01:47:20,130
of the time.

2554
01:47:20,550 --> 01:47:21,920
And you and Owen,
Benjamin,

2555
01:47:21,930 --> 01:47:26,140
Jimmy,
it's this tradition.

2556
01:47:26,141 --> 01:47:26,974
It's just took the fuck that tradition.
It's in the way those people to the 

2557
01:47:28,891 --> 01:47:30,270
right of the stage,
they get fucked.

2558
01:47:30,790 --> 01:47:31,623
You get sit down.
All we're going to be front is getting 

2559
01:47:32,710 --> 01:47:34,680
good now.
Staring at the God damn piano.

2560
01:47:35,750 --> 01:47:37,480
It's bullshit,
right?

2561
01:47:38,280 --> 01:47:41,100
Isn't a bullshit.
Knew how the Improv started.

2562
01:47:41,160 --> 01:47:42,000
Oh,
I do.

2563
01:47:42,510 --> 01:47:43,900
You do.
I'm friends with Bud Freeman.

2564
01:47:43,901 --> 01:47:44,890
How do you like that?
Yeah.

2565
01:47:45,090 --> 01:47:47,460
Huh?
So how did it start?

2566
01:47:47,700 --> 01:47:52,700
So Nike's people made a piano and they 
put it on a stage and a microphone there

2567
01:47:52,861 --> 01:47:55,380
and the comics were constantly annoyed 
by that fucking piano.

2568
01:47:55,410 --> 01:47:56,243
Not True.
She started out as Broadway singers 

2569
01:47:58,561 --> 01:48:01,710
coming in and doing show tunes after 
their shows and people would hang out.

2570
01:48:01,950 --> 01:48:02,783
And guess what?
We'll you know how the south started 

2571
01:48:03,721 --> 01:48:05,370
slavery.
Should we go back to that?

2572
01:48:05,810 --> 01:48:08,370
Jesus went quading a piano.

2573
01:48:08,420 --> 01:48:09,710
Yes.
Slavery.

2574
01:48:10,220 --> 01:48:14,070
Fucking confederate flag in a musical 
instrument form.

2575
01:48:14,220 --> 01:48:17,820
What if it only plays Leonard scanners 
on the piano?

2576
01:48:18,240 --> 01:48:20,610
Just free bird.
Give me three steps.

2577
01:48:20,730 --> 01:48:23,700
Could you do free bird and the piano?
Here's me at the Improv,

2578
01:48:23,701 --> 01:48:26,520
being annoyed by the piano.
It's right there.

2579
01:48:26,850 --> 01:48:27,683
Here's some me off.
That fucking thing is huge and it's in 

2580
01:48:29,401 --> 01:48:30,960
the way.
It's not the best thing.

2581
01:48:30,961 --> 01:48:33,030
It's the best.
Little is the best thing about it.

2582
01:48:33,190 --> 01:48:35,880
They should chop off the side.
You've ever seen him?

2583
01:48:35,940 --> 01:48:37,170
Do you ever,
oh wait,

2584
01:48:37,260 --> 01:48:39,840
let me hear what the chop off the sides 
of that stage.

2585
01:48:40,260 --> 01:48:41,310
Take some date.
Yeah,

2586
01:48:41,311 --> 01:48:44,770
you can take a few feet off of each side
and uh,

2587
01:48:44,780 --> 01:48:48,770
add some more seats.
Get rid of the fucking piano thing.

2588
01:48:48,771 --> 01:48:52,320
Stupid said.
I look fat in that picture.

2589
01:48:53,300 --> 01:48:54,240
Yeah.
It's not real.

2590
01:48:55,020 --> 01:48:57,150
If it was real,
I'd be pissed at myself.

2591
01:48:59,480 --> 01:49:00,650
Fuck,
I gotta do.

2592
01:49:01,100 --> 01:49:05,130
So how do I do I do yoga in there?
Yeah.

2593
01:49:05,131 --> 01:49:08,090
So lenox hill anyway,
till I teach myself musical,

2594
01:49:08,260 --> 01:49:09,093
I call it that.
And Youtube has been phenomenal for 

2595
01:49:10,711 --> 01:49:11,544
that.
When you talk about standup and writing 

2596
01:49:13,141 --> 01:49:16,200
jokes and how many special have you ever
done?

2597
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:17,970
Oh,
this is weird.

2598
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:18,833
I'm,
let me,

2599
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:21,630
I'm going to can do this.
This is,

2600
01:49:22,110 --> 01:49:24,690
that came out last year.
Let's go the chronicles of Fetterman.

2601
01:49:24,691 --> 01:49:27,870
You can open it up if you want that on 
the cover.

2602
01:49:28,040 --> 01:49:29,490
I'll tell you right there.
Thank you.

2603
01:49:29,550 --> 01:49:30,960
Now I feel like you're hitting on me.
No.

2604
01:49:30,961 --> 01:49:33,260
How old were you in that picture?
How long does it,

2605
01:49:33,310 --> 01:49:35,160
what was that picture?
That is 19.

2606
01:49:35,190 --> 01:49:38,370
I mean 2009 the photo.
Yeah.

2607
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:42,600
So the picture is like,
so the picture was many years before the

2608
01:49:42,601 --> 01:49:44,940
actual albums released?
Yes.

2609
01:49:45,660 --> 01:49:46,500
Why is that?
Yes.

2610
01:49:46,530 --> 01:49:47,530
Yeah.
That's picture.

2611
01:49:47,930 --> 01:49:48,390
And

2612
01:49:48,390 --> 01:49:50,050
because it was one,
I don't take good pictures.

2613
01:49:50,500 --> 01:49:53,260
It's like you fuck got one fucking run 
with a marriage.

2614
01:49:53,740 --> 01:49:57,760
That one looks at it goes it this.
Why would you ask that?

2615
01:49:57,790 --> 01:50:01,030
I just look different in that picture.
Yeah.

2616
01:50:01,031 --> 01:50:03,820
It's what I'm from eight years ago or 
seven years ago.

2617
01:50:03,960 --> 01:50:05,800
Um,
so anyway,

2618
01:50:05,890 --> 01:50:07,210
uh,
I have one,

2619
01:50:07,240 --> 01:50:11,230
I just did the comedy central spray.
I've never had a special outside of half

2620
01:50:11,230 --> 01:50:12,190
hour,
a half hour thing,

2621
01:50:12,610 --> 01:50:13,443
but,
and I've never had a comedy album in my 

2622
01:50:15,161 --> 01:50:17,820
life until five months ago.
Hmm.

2623
01:50:18,010 --> 01:50:20,770
So that's what that is.
That is a triple comedy album.

2624
01:50:20,920 --> 01:50:24,430
Compilation of all my stand up through 
the years.

2625
01:50:24,610 --> 01:50:27,600
First bit is from 1984.
Oh yeah.

2626
01:50:27,650 --> 01:50:29,530
Recording on here from [inaudible] 84.
Yeah.

2627
01:50:29,620 --> 01:50:30,610
Wow.
Yeah.

2628
01:50:30,700 --> 01:50:31,533
So 84 80 yard.
Those started to at the comic strip in 

2629
01:50:36,551 --> 01:50:38,710
New York.
I said we started in New York.

2630
01:50:39,310 --> 01:50:41,910
Where are you from originally?
It Florida is shelley was,

2631
01:50:42,190 --> 01:50:45,340
I built this crazy because I took,
I don't know.

2632
01:50:45,640 --> 01:50:47,830
Oh,
I'm not allowed to say Canoga Park.

2633
01:50:47,890 --> 01:50:49,000
Well,
I don't want to say where we are.

2634
01:50:49,660 --> 01:50:50,960
Crazy fans.
Um,

2635
01:50:54,290 --> 01:50:55,123
uh,
but I was actually born in California 

2636
01:50:58,180 --> 01:50:59,590
and then,
uh,

2637
01:50:59,890 --> 01:51:00,723
moved back East when my dad got sick and
then he died and then we moved to 

2638
01:51:06,161 --> 01:51:06,994
Maryland.
My mom remarried and then we moved to 

2639
01:51:08,831 --> 01:51:11,230
Florida and then I started my career in 
New York.

2640
01:51:11,250 --> 01:51:12,250
Oh,
that's intense.

2641
01:51:12,280 --> 01:51:13,113
Yeah.
Yeah.

2642
01:51:13,180 --> 01:51:15,700
How old were you when your dad died?
Like a little over one.

2643
01:51:15,701 --> 01:51:17,500
I have no memory of him.
Wow.

2644
01:51:17,530 --> 01:51:18,363
Yeah.
Yeah.

2645
01:51:18,640 --> 01:51:20,170
So,
so,

2646
01:51:20,171 --> 01:51:21,370
uh,
yeah,

2647
01:51:21,400 --> 01:51:22,600
so,
but I started my,

2648
01:51:22,601 --> 01:51:24,760
as soon as I graduated high school.
And it's interesting,

2649
01:51:24,761 --> 01:51:27,160
we have a Florida connection.
As soon as I graduated high school,

2650
01:51:27,161 --> 01:51:31,060
I got the fuck out of dodge.
I can't have a good move.

2651
01:51:31,061 --> 01:51:32,230
Do you know,
speaking of sports,

2652
01:51:32,231 --> 01:51:36,130
you know where I graduated?
Where in a sports arena,

2653
01:51:36,160 --> 01:51:38,080
do you want to guess it's a gambling 
arena.

2654
01:51:38,500 --> 01:51:39,790
Las Vegas?
No,

2655
01:51:39,820 --> 01:51:44,530
in Florida there's gambling arena and in
Florida it's called high lie.

2656
01:51:44,950 --> 01:51:46,120
Oh,
one of those things.

2657
01:51:46,121 --> 01:51:47,530
You ever heard of it?
Yeah,

2658
01:51:47,531 --> 01:51:49,880
I seen that shit.
Did they still have that?

2659
01:51:49,910 --> 01:51:50,743
I think that little tube to like when 
people are walking their dogs and they 

2660
01:51:54,011 --> 01:51:55,900
throw the ball,
that's what it looks like.

2661
01:51:56,020 --> 01:51:56,680
No.
Yeah,

2662
01:51:56,680 --> 01:51:58,830
they have like a highlight stick.
They throw the ball for dog.

2663
01:51:58,890 --> 01:51:59,723
Oh yeah,
yeah,

2664
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:00,490
yeah,
yeah.

2665
01:52:00,490 --> 01:52:03,370
People that have bad rotator cuffs and 
they can't really throw a ball.

2666
01:52:03,790 --> 01:52:04,780
That's sad.
Right?

2667
01:52:05,060 --> 01:52:07,900
I can't throw a ball.
It's looks just like that.

2668
01:52:07,960 --> 01:52:08,793
Yeah.
It's one of the few sports in the world 

2669
01:52:10,691 --> 01:52:13,420
where you can't be lefthanded and play.
Really?

2670
01:52:13,480 --> 01:52:14,800
Yeah.
Cause there's a wall.

2671
01:52:16,300 --> 01:52:16,730
Yeah.
Good.

2672
01:52:16,730 --> 01:52:19,030
They throw it against the wall.
You can only be writing one of the few.

2673
01:52:20,020 --> 01:52:22,210
And they used to call it the fastest 
sport in the world.

2674
01:52:22,240 --> 01:52:25,000
And then guess who made them take that 
moniker away?

2675
01:52:25,001 --> 01:52:26,650
That was one of those.
The kid was like the fast cars,

2676
01:52:26,651 --> 01:52:28,570
they would,
you know who whipped that thing?

2677
01:52:28,850 --> 01:52:30,910
Golf.
What's the golfers say?

2678
01:52:30,911 --> 01:52:33,910
The ball travels faster when you hit her
off fatigue and it's true.

2679
01:52:34,870 --> 01:52:37,120
So they made him take you down.
He made them.

2680
01:52:37,121 --> 01:52:40,330
They like,
first of all on a sports course.

2681
01:52:40,990 --> 01:52:42,550
Of course.
I want to use weird.

2682
01:52:42,551 --> 01:52:45,720
So I graduated high school.
This is

2683
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:46,873
an I,
I talk about this on stage south 

2684
01:52:48,111 --> 01:52:49,160
plantation.
Hi.

2685
01:52:49,220 --> 01:52:51,290
Let's watch some of this or this.
Oh,

2686
01:52:51,291 --> 01:52:54,500
so it bounces off the wall and then they
throw it and they catch it.

2687
01:52:55,010 --> 01:52:57,110
Right.
So if you were left handed,

2688
01:52:57,111 --> 01:52:58,640
the wall would be in the way?
Yeah.

2689
01:52:58,940 --> 01:53:00,470
Yeah.
Why would the wall be in the way?

2690
01:53:00,760 --> 01:53:03,560
Cause you would smash her arm at Beth 
can against the wall.

2691
01:53:04,540 --> 01:53:06,320
Um,
but they're on the right side.

2692
01:53:06,600 --> 01:53:07,433
It's only one wall or on the right side.
Right there is where I'm going in a way 

2693
01:53:11,270 --> 01:53:13,240
that's dumb as fuck.
You could have a left hand in one.

2694
01:53:13,241 --> 01:53:14,390
Okay.
These guys are idiots.

2695
01:53:17,510 --> 01:53:21,200
Rogan takes down the,
I go to the left and the right.

2696
01:53:21,230 --> 01:53:23,090
If you can go to the left and the right,
it makes no sense.

2697
01:53:23,150 --> 01:53:28,150
There's a net on the right where the 
audience is and then the the wall on the

2698
01:53:29,331 --> 01:53:30,164
left.
Right.

2699
01:53:30,710 --> 01:53:31,610
Okay.
It doesn't matter.

2700
01:53:31,611 --> 01:53:34,850
I don't want to,
but I might be wrong about this.

2701
01:53:34,851 --> 01:53:36,380
Again,
I've been wrong about a lot of things in

2702
01:53:36,381 --> 01:53:38,270
life as you know.
As you know,

2703
01:53:38,390 --> 01:53:43,310
I grew up hearing that that was fixed.
That highlight was fixed.

2704
01:53:43,400 --> 01:53:44,233
Yeah.
Wait,

2705
01:53:44,280 --> 01:53:45,140
wait,
wait.

2706
01:53:45,141 --> 01:53:48,680
You're saying like a fixed like fake,
like they cheat.

2707
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:49,633
I would assume it would be the easiest 
of all the sports to fix because we get 

2708
01:53:53,731 --> 01:53:56,420
that wire left in.
It's forbidden to play.

2709
01:53:56,500 --> 01:53:57,440
Highlight.
Wow.

2710
01:53:57,980 --> 01:53:58,813
How many walls are there in highligh?
Lefthanders can play highlight as long 

2711
01:54:02,481 --> 01:54:04,040
as are willing to use their right hand.

2712
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:09,350
Your right stay correct.
I'm just reading this man.

2713
01:54:09,650 --> 01:54:13,250
The rules and traditions specifically 
forbid playing lefthand did.

2714
01:54:13,251 --> 01:54:14,084
The reason for that is that the court 
only has three walls and one at each 

2715
01:54:18,321 --> 01:54:19,154
end.
One the sidewall and one the left 

2716
01:54:20,391 --> 01:54:21,224
against which the ball can be rebounded 
spectators it behind a chain link fence 

2717
01:54:25,731 --> 01:54:27,710
and the fourth side because of the side 
wall on the left.

2718
01:54:28,040 --> 01:54:28,873
It would be dangerous and almost 
impossible for players to throw and 

2719
01:54:31,431 --> 01:54:33,300
catch with their left hands.
Hmm.

2720
01:54:33,380 --> 01:54:34,400
Okay.
Okay.

2721
01:54:34,490 --> 01:54:37,040
Makes Sense.
I love that fucking game though.

2722
01:54:37,620 --> 01:54:39,170
I agree.
But is it,

2723
01:54:39,890 --> 01:54:41,990
is it the only reason I'm bringing it?
Of course.

2724
01:54:41,991 --> 01:54:42,824
I'm sure.
I'm sure at least one of the eight 

2725
01:54:45,260 --> 01:54:48,200
matches that happen or the 10 matches is
fixed,

2726
01:54:48,230 --> 01:54:49,063
which is why it's a gambling sport.
Like as soon as you get gambling 

2727
01:54:51,051 --> 01:54:53,600
involved,
I would assume it would be the easiest.

2728
01:54:53,630 --> 01:54:54,463
Literally you look at the Guy and wink 
and he drops the ball and they lose 

2729
01:54:57,771 --> 01:54:58,604
that.
It would be the easiest as opposed to a 

2730
01:55:00,261 --> 01:55:03,890
horse might be a little more difficult.
But the reason I bring it up,

2731
01:55:04,430 --> 01:55:06,740
not be telling you my knowledge of 
highline.

2732
01:55:07,850 --> 01:55:10,580
I graduated in a highlife,
Ron Taiwan,

2733
01:55:11,150 --> 01:55:13,310
it's called a Fontan.
Say it again.

2734
01:55:13,460 --> 01:55:17,060
[inaudible] you got it right.
You're nailing it.

2735
01:55:17,061 --> 01:55:20,750
What was that like is saying Florida is 
insane.

2736
01:55:21,650 --> 01:55:22,483
That's my boy.
That's why he got out of there three 

2737
01:55:24,261 --> 01:55:26,120
days.
A audience and this day,

2738
01:55:26,200 --> 01:55:27,160
yeah,
the whole thing.

2739
01:55:27,190 --> 01:55:28,100
Parents,
families.

2740
01:55:28,101 --> 01:55:28,934
And then he goes down in the arena.
We're on the floor on the full on the 

2741
01:55:32,481 --> 01:55:33,530
thing,
the three,

2742
01:55:33,740 --> 01:55:34,573
the three walls around you.
And literally there's like the bedding 

2743
01:55:36,771 --> 01:55:39,760
boards are on both sides.
So it's like the Quinoa,

2744
01:55:39,830 --> 01:55:40,663
the tribe,
you know,

2745
01:55:41,270 --> 01:55:44,310
that's like the worst possible.
Classic Florida.

2746
01:55:44,610 --> 01:55:45,443
That was Florida and that was Florida.
So I got out of there and then went to 

2747
01:55:48,871 --> 01:55:53,250
New York and went to Nyu drama and just 
the boring kind of like normal.

2748
01:55:53,850 --> 01:55:54,900
Wow.
Yeah.

2749
01:55:54,930 --> 01:55:58,140
And then started my stand at catching 
the comic strip or my two clubs.

2750
01:55:58,590 --> 01:55:59,970
I remember those places.
Yeah.

2751
01:55:59,971 --> 01:56:04,971
So I have recordings from those all the 
way up to 2015 was the last one on here.

2752
01:56:06,540 --> 01:56:09,300
So that's bad ass dude.
So it's a whole thing.

2753
01:56:09,301 --> 01:56:10,134
Yeah.
Yeah.

2754
01:56:10,200 --> 01:56:10,921
And so,
yeah,

2755
01:56:10,921 --> 01:56:11,754
I've never had a comedy album before,
so not that I want this whole thing to 

2756
01:56:14,641 --> 01:56:15,990
be about the comedy.
I'm,

2757
01:56:15,991 --> 01:56:16,824
but that's Wayne and I,
who should tell everybody we met on the 

2758
01:56:18,811 --> 01:56:22,980
set of a pilot that never happened.
Remember that thing I have to say we met

2759
01:56:22,981 --> 01:56:23,761
before then.
Well,

2760
01:56:23,761 --> 01:56:24,594
we met before then,
but we became friends on the side of 

2761
01:56:26,641 --> 01:56:27,240
that.

2762
01:56:27,240 --> 01:56:29,010
Right.
That thing that,

2763
01:56:29,011 --> 01:56:30,210
uh,
overseas,

2764
01:56:30,660 --> 01:56:33,180
do you remember they did an episode of 
your television show?

2765
01:56:33,540 --> 01:56:34,373
Yeah,
yeah,

2766
01:56:34,500 --> 01:56:35,350
yeah.
News radio.

2767
01:56:35,430 --> 01:56:36,240
Yeah.
Yeah.

2768
01:56:36,240 --> 01:56:38,790
One.
And I remember something he said to me,

2769
01:56:38,791 --> 01:56:41,590
Joe Rogan,
he said,

2770
01:56:42,920 --> 01:56:43,753
he said,
you said you were talking about news 

2771
01:56:47,291 --> 01:56:48,800
radio and you go,
you know what,

2772
01:56:48,830 --> 01:56:49,663
we were doing the pilot and you're like,
you know there's a certain kind of like 

2773
01:56:53,610 --> 01:56:54,443
special quality that happens amongst 
people that creates a sitcom as much as 

2774
01:56:59,701 --> 01:57:02,700
of the writing and I just hope we can 
capture that.

2775
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:04,470
Is that what I said?
Yeah you weren't,

2776
01:57:04,480 --> 01:57:06,840
you were saying,
you said that it was more than a Sitcom,

2777
01:57:06,841 --> 01:57:10,140
like a successful Sitcom is more than 
just funny jokes.

2778
01:57:10,730 --> 01:57:11,630
Yeah,
it definitely is.

2779
01:57:11,660 --> 01:57:13,190
Do you agree with that?
Yeah,

2780
01:57:13,191 --> 01:57:15,260
for sure.
Do you agree with your younger self?

2781
01:57:15,290 --> 01:57:16,123
Yes,
I do.

2782
01:57:16,430 --> 01:57:17,263
Yeah.
Well I was super lucky in that I got 

2783
01:57:18,891 --> 01:57:19,724
cast on news radio and we got along like
the cast got along on a pretty 

2784
01:57:24,081 --> 01:57:26,360
incredible way,
like the way we jive together.

2785
01:57:26,361 --> 01:57:27,660
Like there was a,
yeah,

2786
01:57:28,310 --> 01:57:29,143
there was a,
I mean even like guys that I didn't 

2787
01:57:31,011 --> 01:57:33,650
necessarily get along with that well 
like Andy Dick,

2788
01:57:33,710 --> 01:57:36,170
right.
Who was just like so much work.

2789
01:57:36,171 --> 01:57:37,004
It was hard to get along with Andy.
But when we did get along like well 

2790
01:57:39,810 --> 01:57:41,630
unset,
we had amazing chemistry.

2791
01:57:41,660 --> 01:57:42,420
Yeah.
You know,

2792
01:57:42,420 --> 01:57:43,400
because our,
our,

2793
01:57:43,730 --> 01:57:45,320
our characters,
you know,

2794
01:57:45,321 --> 01:57:48,590
the way we would interact with each 
other like in scenes was great.

2795
01:57:49,160 --> 01:57:50,510
But then there was also,
you know,

2796
01:57:50,690 --> 01:57:53,210
everybody on it was so good.
It was just,

2797
01:57:53,240 --> 01:57:56,540
that was just a super fortunate place to
be.

2798
01:57:56,570 --> 01:57:58,720
But there's been good actors and bad,
you know,

2799
01:57:58,730 --> 01:57:59,960
and tickets.
It don't work.

2800
01:58:00,210 --> 01:58:03,050
I had writing too.
You got to have good writing.

2801
01:58:03,080 --> 01:58:04,130
You know?
Newsradio was like,

2802
01:58:04,131 --> 01:58:04,964
in a lot of ways it was a perfect storm.
It was also perfect storm in that it 

2803
01:58:07,281 --> 01:58:09,830
wasn't successful.
How many years was zone five?

2804
01:58:10,490 --> 01:58:12,950
But it was never really successful.
Like at one point in time we were number

2805
01:58:12,951 --> 01:58:13,784
88 in the ratings.
Did you think you were going to get 

2806
01:58:15,801 --> 01:58:16,580
canceled?
Yeah,

2807
01:58:16,580 --> 01:58:17,690
every year.
Every year.

2808
01:58:17,720 --> 01:58:18,553
The only year we didn't think we were 
going to get cancer was the year we got 

2809
01:58:20,301 --> 01:58:21,134
canceled.

2810
01:58:22,530 --> 01:58:22,800
Yeah.

2811
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:23,633
That was after Phil died a life.
Cause we did and he came back and did a 

2812
01:58:26,641 --> 01:58:28,520
a season with Jon Lovitz.
Right.

2813
01:58:28,521 --> 01:58:30,080
That's the season I did.
Yeah.

2814
01:58:30,170 --> 01:58:31,040
Yeah,
we did.

2815
01:58:31,041 --> 01:58:33,560
Um,
that last season would love it.

2816
01:58:33,710 --> 01:58:34,790
And that was also

2817
01:58:35,890 --> 01:58:40,390
same time when we were doing overseas.
It was during the same creator,

2818
01:58:40,391 --> 01:58:41,620
right.
Paul Simms.

2819
01:58:41,621 --> 01:58:43,840
Yeah.
And uh,

2820
01:58:44,050 --> 01:58:47,320
it just,
it just wasn't the same without Phil for

2821
01:58:47,321 --> 01:58:48,154
sure.
But the,

2822
01:58:48,160 --> 01:58:48,993
the,
the show wasn't owned by the right 

2823
01:58:50,801 --> 01:58:54,100
people,
so it never got that juicy after friends

2824
01:58:54,101 --> 01:58:58,380
time slot that there was so many shows 
that were horrible,

2825
01:58:58,600 --> 01:59:01,150
that went on for a long time and did 
really well in the ratings.

2826
01:59:01,151 --> 01:59:01,984
It's like,
do you remember sex in the city or like 

2827
01:59:03,281 --> 01:59:07,720
we used to call sex in the shitty.
Did you ever see that it's not on NBC,

2828
01:59:08,050 --> 01:59:08,883
not sex and the city,
Carolina in the shitty caroline in the 

2829
01:59:11,111 --> 01:59:12,010
city,
that's the one.

2830
01:59:13,600 --> 01:59:16,210
They're the same thing to me.
It's a fucking chick show.

2831
01:59:16,211 --> 01:59:18,610
I have them in like a box in my brain,
a category.

2832
01:59:18,940 --> 01:59:20,650
And then there was another one that was 
way worse.

2833
01:59:20,650 --> 01:59:22,570
The single guy.
Do you remember the single guy?

2834
01:59:22,810 --> 01:59:24,340
Actually I don't.
Oh,

2835
01:59:24,430 --> 01:59:29,200
Jonathan Silverman.
It was like someone had,

2836
01:59:29,350 --> 01:59:33,130
they got prime spots that you guys,
amazing spots.

2837
01:59:33,131 --> 01:59:34,960
There was like number two,
number three in the ratings,

2838
01:59:35,440 --> 01:59:38,470
there were the post friends,
there was friends Seinfeld,

2839
01:59:38,650 --> 01:59:39,483
there was that,
that sort of a Thursday night right 

2840
01:59:42,100 --> 01:59:44,200
group.
And uh,

2841
01:59:44,260 --> 01:59:46,840
that used to be what you needed to get 
on.

2842
01:59:46,930 --> 01:59:47,763
You need to get on that Thursday night 
lineup in order to have a successful 

2843
01:59:50,740 --> 01:59:53,110
must see tv.
Yeah.

2844
01:59:53,410 --> 01:59:56,020
But there was a different time then 
because when they moved you,

2845
01:59:56,170 --> 01:59:59,080
no one knew where the fuck you where we 
got moved nine,

2846
01:59:59,230 --> 02:00:01,990
eight or nine times over the past five 
years.

2847
02:00:02,050 --> 02:00:02,711
Oh,
that's horrible.

2848
02:00:02,711 --> 02:00:03,544
So we were on like Monday night and 
Sunday night and Tuesday night and we 

2849
02:00:05,801 --> 02:00:06,634
were all over the fucking place and one 
time we were on Thursday and we were 

2850
02:00:09,881 --> 02:00:10,714
like,
number two.

2851
02:00:11,040 --> 02:00:13,120
Do you have a favorite episode that you 
did?

2852
02:00:13,150 --> 02:00:14,590
Yeah,
the one we did in space,

2853
02:00:14,980 --> 02:00:17,380
we just space episode.
It was ridiculous.

2854
02:00:17,800 --> 02:00:18,633
We did,
uh,

2855
02:00:19,140 --> 02:00:22,150
the fucking,
the writers were so goddamn good.

2856
02:00:22,740 --> 02:00:24,970
It really spoiled me.
Like,

2857
02:00:25,120 --> 02:00:25,953
that's probably one of the reasons why I
never did a sitcom after that because 

2858
02:00:28,481 --> 02:00:30,860
they were so good.
Did you ever guest on a sec?

2859
02:00:31,600 --> 02:00:33,760
Yeah,
I guested on um,

2860
02:00:34,060 --> 02:00:36,190
you did something right?
Yeah,

2861
02:00:36,490 --> 02:00:39,310
I did a what was the David spade one 
where they,

2862
02:00:39,990 --> 02:00:40,860
oh,
the music,

2863
02:00:40,870 --> 02:00:41,950
shoot me.
Just shoot me.

2864
02:00:41,951 --> 02:00:42,784
Yeah.
Yeah,

2865
02:00:42,790 --> 02:00:44,800
I did an episode of that.
I did an episode,

2866
02:00:44,801 --> 02:00:48,700
a couple of ones.
What was the difference between being on

2867
02:00:48,701 --> 02:00:52,510
the show cast regular and guest starring
cause you're liking?

2868
02:00:52,900 --> 02:00:53,501
Ah,
well,

2869
02:00:53,501 --> 02:00:55,510
you know,
obviously the comfort level,

2870
02:00:55,511 --> 02:00:57,040
you know,
and you're on a set and you're there all

2871
02:00:57,041 --> 02:00:57,874
the time and you know,
a little makeup lady and the sound guys 

2872
02:01:00,401 --> 02:01:01,234
and the bill,
the camera man are all the same folks 

2873
02:01:03,701 --> 02:01:04,780
and you become friends with them.

2874
02:01:05,900 --> 02:01:07,960
You know,
there's a comfort comfort level there.

2875
02:01:08,110 --> 02:01:08,943
But uh,
just shoot me with all due respect 

2876
02:01:12,431 --> 02:01:14,440
wasn't as good.
It wasn't as funny,

2877
02:01:14,920 --> 02:01:15,910
you know,
for you.

2878
02:01:16,280 --> 02:01:17,230
For me.
Yeah.

2879
02:01:17,320 --> 02:01:20,920
But there was something about news radio
that was just really special.

2880
02:01:20,980 --> 02:01:22,400
It was all a lot of it.
It was day fold.

2881
02:01:22,401 --> 02:01:24,820
He was a big part of it too,
because Dave fold,

2882
02:01:24,821 --> 02:01:27,010
that's the space episode.
We did a whole episode,

2883
02:01:27,011 --> 02:01:28,390
Steven,
we were in space.

2884
02:01:29,380 --> 02:01:31,690
It was amazing.
Dave Foley was like a,

2885
02:01:31,720 --> 02:01:34,540
almost like the secret producer of that 
show because he,

2886
02:01:34,541 --> 02:01:38,110
they gave him,
the writers were so smart that they gave

2887
02:01:38,111 --> 02:01:40,010
him a pretty much

2888
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:42,890
everybody artistic license to try out 
new ideas.

2889
02:01:43,340 --> 02:01:44,173
And because of the fact that Dave was 
one of the guys from kids in the hall 

2890
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:48,830
was such a,
a brilliant writer.

2891
02:01:48,831 --> 02:01:50,990
Just a brilliant guy.
Very fucking smart guy.

2892
02:01:51,710 --> 02:01:52,790
Um,
he always,

2893
02:01:52,791 --> 02:01:53,990
has he been on your illusion?
Yeah.

2894
02:01:54,020 --> 02:01:54,980
He's been on.
Yeah.

2895
02:01:55,400 --> 02:01:56,233
He told some of the most depressing I 
know about his doors in life about 

2896
02:01:58,641 --> 02:02:00,250
divorce.
Good Lord.

2897
02:02:00,450 --> 02:02:01,283
To talk about a man who's been fucking 
need Paula over and over again through 

2898
02:02:06,321 --> 02:02:08,120
divorce.
It is horrible,

2899
02:02:08,121 --> 02:02:10,220
man.
Horrible what they did to him.

2900
02:02:11,180 --> 02:02:12,410
I know.
It's really sad,

2901
02:02:13,070 --> 02:02:15,080
but he sees finally I think coming 
through it.

2902
02:02:15,110 --> 02:02:15,451
Well,
he's,

2903
02:02:15,451 --> 02:02:17,960
he's,
he's on a sex successful,

2904
02:02:18,080 --> 02:02:20,780
successful show now that with doctor 
Ken.

2905
02:02:21,110 --> 02:02:21,943
Yeah.
Yeah.

2906
02:02:22,070 --> 02:02:23,530
What does that show called?
Doc.

2907
02:02:23,540 --> 02:02:24,980
Doctor Ken.
Doctor.

2908
02:02:25,070 --> 02:02:26,630
Yeah.
But it's uh,

2909
02:02:26,650 --> 02:02:27,500
it's doing well,
right?

2910
02:02:27,501 --> 02:02:29,460
Isn't that [inaudible] doing well?
I think it's,

2911
02:02:30,140 --> 02:02:33,600
I think,
I think it's holding on totally on their

2912
02:02:33,610 --> 02:02:38,160
own ticket cancelled and no renewed 
renewed.

2913
02:02:38,260 --> 02:02:39,093
Yeah.
Well good cause he owes about a half 

2914
02:02:40,370 --> 02:02:42,950
million bucks or it can't get to Canada 
if Dave doesn't go to Canada.

2915
02:02:43,310 --> 02:02:45,090
I mean if Dave doesn't pay up,
he,

2916
02:02:45,200 --> 02:02:46,033
his um,
his alimony and child support are off 

2917
02:02:49,221 --> 02:02:50,054
the charts because it was based on the 
money that he was making during news 

2918
02:02:52,651 --> 02:02:53,450
radio.
Right.

2919
02:02:53,450 --> 02:02:54,283
And then that was the most money I'd 
ever made in his life and never came 

2920
02:02:56,001 --> 02:02:58,040
close to it ever since.
And it didn't matter.

2921
02:02:58,160 --> 02:02:58,993
The doctor said to him is one of the 
most depressing things about the 

2922
02:03:00,471 --> 02:03:01,304
podcast.
Your ability to pay has no relation to 

2923
02:03:04,851 --> 02:03:09,050
your obligation to pay.
So the doctor was like,

2924
02:03:09,051 --> 02:03:09,884
look,
you,

2925
02:03:09,890 --> 02:03:12,260
you establish a lifestyle.
Your same doctor.

2926
02:03:12,590 --> 02:03:14,270
The doctor said,
doc,

2927
02:03:14,271 --> 02:03:17,030
did he say doctor?
I did the judge just having that.

2928
02:03:17,410 --> 02:03:18,560
It's a judge.
Some,

2929
02:03:18,590 --> 02:03:20,870
some soup character,
some official,

2930
02:03:20,900 --> 02:03:21,231
no,
I mean,

2931
02:03:21,231 --> 02:03:22,630
did you just have a brain aneurism?
No,

2932
02:03:22,640 --> 02:03:25,910
just forgot what I was talking about.
You already and we need to take a break.

2933
02:03:26,130 --> 02:03:26,963
He trying to just sit down.
I'm trying to say for no reason 

2934
02:03:28,341 --> 02:03:30,410
whatsoever other than to get your own 
rocks off the,

2935
02:03:30,660 --> 02:03:34,910
the judge told him that and he was just 
devastated.

2936
02:03:34,940 --> 02:03:35,773
And in a lot of ways,
I don't think he ever recovered from 

2937
02:03:37,551 --> 02:03:37,971
that.
You know,

2938
02:03:37,971 --> 02:03:38,804
like when you find out that a doctor,
I mean a judge is doing and the system 

2939
02:03:44,121 --> 02:03:48,940
is so bad and so poorly constructed got 
lives.

2940
02:03:49,280 --> 02:03:50,113
I mean,
we're already laughing.

2941
02:03:53,540 --> 02:03:57,110
Have you been married now?
Would you be willing to doing yeah,

2942
02:03:57,270 --> 02:03:59,510
he would definitely not signal out there
to the ladies.

2943
02:03:59,511 --> 02:04:00,344
Let them know who we are.
Ready?

2944
02:04:00,470 --> 02:04:01,580
Yeah.
Lead time.

2945
02:04:01,610 --> 02:04:03,960
Yeah.
It's time passed.

2946
02:04:03,970 --> 02:04:06,210
I feel like I'm a,
you know that shit.

2947
02:04:06,570 --> 02:04:07,540
Yeah.
Yeah.

2948
02:04:07,850 --> 02:04:09,560
I'm having a family.
I don't know.

2949
02:04:10,210 --> 02:04:11,450
Yeah,
hold on,

2950
02:04:11,510 --> 02:04:14,270
hold on.
It we don't cramp in my leg.

2951
02:04:14,770 --> 02:04:15,603
Yeah,
it's over.

2952
02:04:15,890 --> 02:04:20,210
Don't marriage gives you a cramp.
Just talking about it.

2953
02:04:20,420 --> 02:04:22,950
Talking about making a commitment with a
woman.

2954
02:04:22,951 --> 02:04:24,020
And I was like,
well,

2955
02:04:24,050 --> 02:04:26,390
it's also the Canadian system is pretty 
brutal.

2956
02:04:26,440 --> 02:04:29,060
Can Canada's very different than the 
United States.

2957
02:04:29,660 --> 02:04:30,550
And,
uh,

2958
02:04:30,710 --> 02:04:32,630
they just,
Oh,

2959
02:04:33,560 --> 02:04:37,030
I'll keep talking.
I'll ask you about something.

2960
02:04:37,080 --> 02:04:38,100
Okay.
Just hit me.

2961
02:04:38,950 --> 02:04:40,560
Do you want to keep talking about Foley 
weekend?

2962
02:04:40,620 --> 02:04:42,060
No.
Okay.

2963
02:04:42,330 --> 02:04:43,163
Okay.
There's this girl I was trying to date 

2964
02:04:44,971 --> 02:04:45,804
or should nine interest in May but,
but has gone to the Amazon and done 

2965
02:04:51,451 --> 02:04:54,780
Iowasca.
And who she said that you,

2966
02:04:55,500 --> 02:05:00,500
I don't know if she learned about it 
from you or you were advocating for it,

2967
02:05:01,440 --> 02:05:03,210
but uh,
she,

2968
02:05:03,211 --> 02:05:04,044
yeah,
she went down there a couple times and 

2969
02:05:04,651 --> 02:05:07,800
then did it not in the Amazon.
How many times have you done it?

2970
02:05:08,610 --> 02:05:11,580
I haven't done Iowasca.
What I've done is Dmt,

2971
02:05:11,581 --> 02:05:13,660
which is the active compound in Iowa 
still.

2972
02:05:13,670 --> 02:05:14,503
Okay.
Okay.

2973
02:05:14,550 --> 02:05:15,990
What I ask it is,
here's,

2974
02:05:16,020 --> 02:05:16,853
here's what I want us to is the Amazon 
indigenous people figured out a way to 

2975
02:05:21,061 --> 02:05:21,894
make dmt orally active DMT is broken 
down in your gut by something called 

2976
02:05:26,791 --> 02:05:29,640
monoamine oxidase and all of this makes 
sense.

2977
02:05:29,700 --> 02:05:33,420
So when you eat it,
that's why when you eat a lot of grasses

2978
02:05:33,421 --> 02:05:34,254
and different plants,
you don't get high off the DMT in it 

2979
02:05:35,851 --> 02:05:37,350
because it gets broken down in your gut.

2980
02:05:37,950 --> 02:05:38,783
Well,
so what they figured out as a way to 

2981
02:05:39,631 --> 02:05:40,464
combine the leaves of one plant,
which contained the DMT and the source 

2982
02:05:45,381 --> 02:05:47,500
of the leaves,
email and Hibbert.

2983
02:05:47,640 --> 02:05:49,110
No,
it's an Mao inhibitor.

2984
02:05:50,070 --> 02:05:53,460
And so this combination of the two 
plants,

2985
02:05:53,580 --> 02:05:57,510
one that contains DMT and one that 
suppresses model aiming oxidase and your

2986
02:05:57,511 --> 02:06:01,800
gut allows you to experience dimethyl 
trip to me orally.

2987
02:06:02,100 --> 02:06:06,030
So it's a long dmt trip.
What I've done is smoke it,

2988
02:06:06,031 --> 02:06:08,580
which is way more intense,
but way shorter.

2989
02:06:08,581 --> 02:06:09,414
Last,
have you?

2990
02:06:09,420 --> 02:06:11,790
When was the last time he did something?
Cause I think a year ago.

2991
02:06:11,970 --> 02:06:12,900
A year ago?
Yeah.

2992
02:06:12,960 --> 02:06:14,910
What?
All right.

2993
02:06:14,940 --> 02:06:16,070
All right.
Because I,

2994
02:06:16,090 --> 02:06:18,630
you know me,
we've known each other 20 some years.

2995
02:06:18,870 --> 02:06:22,560
I'm not like a pot smoker.
Don't really drink at all.

2996
02:06:23,110 --> 02:06:26,430
Uh,
but I'm a drug experimenter.

2997
02:06:26,820 --> 02:06:29,790
Like I've done mushrooms,
gas,

2998
02:06:29,820 --> 02:06:31,380
that's my favorite truck.
It's a great drug.

2999
02:06:31,700 --> 02:06:33,390
It's very similar.

3000
02:06:33,420 --> 02:06:35,570
They are in,
in their reaction,

3001
02:06:35,590 --> 02:06:40,440
especially at high doses to dmt.
And in fact they're there.

3002
02:06:40,470 --> 02:06:42,450
They're very similar.
Um,

3003
02:06:42,510 --> 02:06:45,360
as far as the compound themselves,
I think there's,

3004
02:06:45,361 --> 02:06:47,490
where the way it's expressed in the 
body.

3005
02:06:47,950 --> 02:06:52,950
A DMT is n n dimethyltryptamine and when
Psilocybin is broken down in the body,

3006
02:06:54,241 --> 02:06:56,280
it produces something called for Fox 
four.

3007
02:06:56,430 --> 02:07:00,240
See and Hen Diane [inaudible],
I'm kind of like glazing manner,

3008
02:07:00,300 --> 02:07:01,133
which is,
I'm just saying they're really closely 

3009
02:07:02,461 --> 02:07:03,294
related with the most potent psychedelic
drugs are very closely related to basic 

3010
02:07:07,531 --> 02:07:12,520
human neurochemistry.
And DMT is human neurochemistry is,

3011
02:07:12,540 --> 02:07:15,330
is actually the most potent psychedelic 
drug known to man.

3012
02:07:15,360 --> 02:07:18,720
And it's actually produced by your body.
It's produced in your liver,

3013
02:07:18,721 --> 02:07:21,660
it's produced in your lungs and it's 
produced pineal gland.

3014
02:07:21,870 --> 02:07:22,800
Okay.
Let me ask you a question.

3015
02:07:23,100 --> 02:07:25,380
When you smoke the DMT,
how many times have you done it?

3016
02:07:25,980 --> 02:07:26,813
Nine Times.

3017
02:07:27,090 --> 02:07:27,840
Nine?
Yeah.

3018
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:29,310
Will there be a 10?
Yes.

3019
02:07:29,730 --> 02:07:32,100
Today with Wayne,
uh,

3020
02:07:32,101 --> 02:07:34,740
well I don't have it here,
but if I did,

3021
02:07:34,770 --> 02:07:36,580
if really wanted to go,
we could do it.

3022
02:07:36,640 --> 02:07:39,760
What would live with them?
Ready to do it again.

3023
02:07:39,761 --> 02:07:42,850
I need,
I think I usually need some time after I

3024
02:07:42,851 --> 02:07:46,660
do it to sit back and think about it and
absorb it and taken in.

3025
02:07:47,370 --> 02:07:49,180
But do you feel like it helped your 
standup at all?

3026
02:07:49,240 --> 02:07:51,370
100%.
It helps everything in my life.

3027
02:07:51,430 --> 02:07:54,430
It helps me or any downside.
Yeah.

3028
02:07:54,730 --> 02:07:56,560
Yeah.
You get the,

3029
02:07:56,680 --> 02:08:01,600
there's a real anxiety that happened to 
me once after it was over.

3030
02:08:01,990 --> 02:08:05,470
I did one,
one trip where it was incredibly intense

3031
02:08:05,560 --> 02:08:08,770
and um,
wouldn't say overdose.

3032
02:08:08,771 --> 02:08:12,010
You don't overdose because it's a 
natural part of your brain.

3033
02:08:12,011 --> 02:08:15,280
Your brain knows how to bring it back to
baseline very quickly.

3034
02:08:15,281 --> 02:08:17,830
It's like one of the most transient 
drugs ever observed in the body.

3035
02:08:17,830 --> 02:08:18,663
You go from being blasted out of your 
fucking mind to completely sober in 20 

3036
02:08:23,231 --> 02:08:25,690
minutes.
All right.

3037
02:08:25,780 --> 02:08:26,613
Yeah.
How would you then you just dive back 

3038
02:08:28,991 --> 02:08:30,670
in.
The last time I did it,

3039
02:08:30,700 --> 02:08:32,740
we did it like four or five times,
so it was,

3040
02:08:33,160 --> 02:08:37,360
I was pretty Gonzo for about an hour and
a half or so.

3041
02:08:37,390 --> 02:08:41,170
Somewhere around there just go.
We would go in,

3042
02:08:41,380 --> 02:08:42,970
come out,
go back in again.

3043
02:08:43,340 --> 02:08:45,700
Meantime,
the whole time this is going on,

3044
02:08:45,701 --> 02:08:47,950
we're playing this a South American 
music,

3045
02:08:47,951 --> 02:08:51,790
these ICAROS,
which these shamans have created to sort

3046
02:08:51,791 --> 02:08:54,380
of coax the experience.
I need a showman.

3047
02:08:55,040 --> 02:08:55,960
No,
you don't need a showman.

3048
02:08:56,290 --> 02:08:57,940
If you're going to do DMT,
there's,

3049
02:08:58,270 --> 02:09:00,580
there's Wayne Fetterman.
Just wait again.

3050
02:09:00,610 --> 02:09:01,930
You know me,
I'm kind of a straight,

3051
02:09:01,931 --> 02:09:02,764
you know,
I'm not,

3052
02:09:03,130 --> 02:09:05,070
I'm not an edgy guy.
Really?

3053
02:09:05,300 --> 02:09:06,520
Okay.
Um,

3054
02:09:06,820 --> 02:09:08,830
what would you recommend?
How would you recommend they do?

3055
02:09:08,890 --> 02:09:09,880
Have you ever smoked crack?

3056
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,280
No.
Would you know with Wayne?

3057
02:09:12,430 --> 02:09:14,110
No.
But if I did this face,

3058
02:09:14,430 --> 02:09:15,780
no,
I didn't know.

3059
02:09:15,960 --> 02:09:17,620
I'm no interested in,
in crack.

3060
02:09:17,680 --> 02:09:19,450
I don't have any interest in even 
cocaine.

3061
02:09:19,500 --> 02:09:21,040
I've never done cocaine.
No.

3062
02:09:21,220 --> 02:09:22,300
Oh No,
I don't.

3063
02:09:22,301 --> 02:09:23,134
I don't have any interest in stimulants.
I'm not interested in anything that 

3064
02:09:26,021 --> 02:09:29,050
gives me confidence.
I'm not interested in any false sense of

3065
02:09:29,051 --> 02:09:31,990
bravado and getting boosted up.
I'm not interested in that.

3066
02:09:31,991 --> 02:09:32,670
Okay.
Okay.

3067
02:09:32,670 --> 02:09:36,760
If it feels like amphetamines and speed,
what they do is they,

3068
02:09:36,900 --> 02:09:40,750
they remove inhibitions in a way that 
gets you in a lot of trouble.

3069
02:09:40,860 --> 02:09:41,620
What about,
you know,

3070
02:09:41,620 --> 02:09:42,820
drinking?
I like drinking,

3071
02:09:43,180 --> 02:09:47,230
even though that's a barbiturate right.
Bar barbiturate it drinking is a downer,

3072
02:09:47,380 --> 02:09:49,600
right?
That's not a barbiturate though.

3073
02:09:49,810 --> 02:09:53,110
Like isn't a barbiturate a specific 
class of drugs is alcohol.

3074
02:09:53,111 --> 02:09:55,100
Barbiturates.
And I think Erbitux,

3075
02:09:55,110 --> 02:09:58,600
it is a very specific class of Downer 
isn't it?

3076
02:09:58,900 --> 02:10:00,820
We're gonna find out that was when I 
was,

3077
02:10:01,180 --> 02:10:03,370
I not asked.
I don't drink really.

3078
02:10:03,371 --> 02:10:06,650
But as there's a rule,
say barbiturates overdose,

3079
02:10:06,760 --> 02:10:10,120
Bababababa central nervous system,
depressants,

3080
02:10:10,180 --> 02:10:11,380
alcohol,
opiates.

3081
02:10:11,530 --> 02:10:12,363
Okay.
So that's what they're saying is an 

3082
02:10:13,151 --> 02:10:14,560
overdose.
No,

3083
02:10:14,561 --> 02:10:16,860
I'm not talking about,
so I'm just saying that Picchu,

3084
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:20,350
it's in overdose with other central 
nervous system depression.

3085
02:10:20,351 --> 02:10:20,770
It's,
no,

3086
02:10:20,770 --> 02:10:23,320
that's not what it's saying.
So it's not saying,

3087
02:10:23,430 --> 02:10:25,510
so it's different.
They're saying something different.

3088
02:10:25,511 --> 02:10:26,344
You're saying,
I'm just saying is alcohol or 

3089
02:10:27,251 --> 02:10:30,040
barbiturates?
That's no,

3090
02:10:30,430 --> 02:10:31,263
no.
It said you shouldn't be mixed with 

3091
02:10:31,871 --> 02:10:32,704
alcohol.
Barbiturates should not be mixed with 

3092
02:10:33,891 --> 02:10:34,280
alcohol.

3093
02:10:34,280 --> 02:10:39,080
So edition is alcohol a drug or 
antidepressant or barbiturate or all the

3094
02:10:39,081 --> 02:10:40,780
above?
What the fuck kind of question is that?

3095
02:10:41,580 --> 02:10:44,150
Um,
yeah.

3096
02:10:44,151 --> 02:10:45,860
It's not the same thing.
It's a depressant.

3097
02:10:45,980 --> 02:10:48,200
It's a depressed,
it's not a stimulant.

3098
02:10:48,230 --> 02:10:49,190
No,
it's not a stimulant.

3099
02:10:49,220 --> 02:10:51,890
But it does loosen inhibitions.
Yeah.

3100
02:10:52,010 --> 02:10:53,360
For me,
social lubricant.

3101
02:10:53,380 --> 02:10:55,520
Me With the layman when I'm drinking.
Oh yeah.

3102
02:10:55,521 --> 02:10:56,820
What happens?
Um,

3103
02:10:56,821 --> 02:10:57,950
but way more,
um,

3104
02:10:58,300 --> 02:11:01,940
better.
Better is fun.

3105
02:11:02,210 --> 02:11:05,780
I would,
I hopefully I'm fun no matter what,

3106
02:11:06,260 --> 02:11:08,210
no matter what the scenario,
but I will fail.

3107
02:11:08,211 --> 02:11:11,690
I feel like I'm a little more sexually 
aggressive when I'm on a whoa.

3108
02:11:12,170 --> 02:11:13,003
Jesus settled down.
I know you a little random men to get a 

3109
02:11:14,841 --> 02:11:19,250
little rapey wouldn't use the word.
We can use that descriptor,

3110
02:11:19,280 --> 02:11:20,720
but um,
yeah,

3111
02:11:20,750 --> 02:11:23,120
I feel you.
What do you drink?

3112
02:11:23,121 --> 02:11:23,630
Beer,
right?

3113
02:11:23,630 --> 02:11:24,350
I drink.
Yeah.

3114
02:11:24,350 --> 02:11:25,400
Yeah.
I like,

3115
02:11:25,490 --> 02:11:26,180
I like to drink.

3116
02:11:26,180 --> 02:11:28,130
I only drink to get drunk.
Really?

3117
02:11:28,220 --> 02:11:29,420
That's my style.
Yeah.

3118
02:11:29,530 --> 02:11:31,670
So I don't ever casual,
you never see me.

3119
02:11:31,760 --> 02:11:33,200
You don't drink a glass of wine with 
dinner?

3120
02:11:33,350 --> 02:11:34,183
No.
Never.

3121
02:11:34,280 --> 02:11:35,930
Oh really?
That's what I enjoy the most.

3122
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,870
Never meet.
I'm going to have the red.

3123
02:11:39,350 --> 02:11:42,010
What is this a piece of fish?
The white of,

3124
02:11:42,011 --> 02:11:43,400
that's the way the other one.
Yeah.

3125
02:11:43,520 --> 02:11:44,570
No,
I um,

3126
02:11:44,810 --> 02:11:45,643
drink way more.
One drink with dinner than anything 

3127
02:11:48,741 --> 02:11:50,000
else.
What do you get from it?

3128
02:11:50,330 --> 02:11:52,850
I like glass of wine.
I enjoy the taste dictate.

3129
02:11:52,880 --> 02:11:55,530
If there was no alcohol in it.
You think you enjoyed the taste?

3130
02:11:55,580 --> 02:11:58,340
I have.
I have like really low alcohol wine.

3131
02:11:58,341 --> 02:11:59,550
That doesn't do anything for me.
Well,

3132
02:11:59,560 --> 02:12:00,393
okay,
so you like,

3133
02:12:00,580 --> 02:12:03,310
do you like doing this Paleo wine?
No,

3134
02:12:03,320 --> 02:12:03,671
no,
no,

3135
02:12:03,671 --> 02:12:05,150
not a freak about it.
I don't know enough.

3136
02:12:05,570 --> 02:12:06,740
I liked the way it smells though.

3137
02:12:06,740 --> 02:12:09,530
I liked the way it tastes.
I like to sip it with dinner.

3138
02:12:09,590 --> 02:12:12,590
I like a nice wine with dinner,
but I like a little buzz too.

3139
02:12:12,760 --> 02:12:15,680
I'll go like a couple of glasses of nice
and I don't,

3140
02:12:15,830 --> 02:12:17,000
yeah,
I again,

3141
02:12:17,300 --> 02:12:19,970
it's far from judging as possible.
Just curious.

3142
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:20,440
No,
not,

3143
02:12:20,440 --> 02:12:22,390
not defensive.
Yeah.

3144
02:12:22,600 --> 02:12:24,230
Um,
but uh,

3145
02:12:24,760 --> 02:12:28,130
so alcohol is a depressant.
That's what I just meant.

3146
02:12:28,200 --> 02:12:31,040
It's like a barbiturate it said,
not a steaming up,

3147
02:12:31,160 --> 02:12:36,160
but it does allow me to get what your 
word confident race,

3148
02:12:36,860 --> 02:12:37,610
say.
Well,

3149
02:12:37,610 --> 02:12:38,443
you might meet,
might have confidence issues a little 

3150
02:12:39,981 --> 02:12:40,814
bit and I'm chillers really comedian,
comedian asking for approval from 

3151
02:12:46,521 --> 02:12:48,410
strangers might have competence.
What I'm saying,

3152
02:12:48,470 --> 02:12:50,290
that's an interesting insight.
Let me think about that.

3153
02:12:50,300 --> 02:12:53,540
I go on deepen.
I take one chances go on a whim.

3154
02:12:54,110 --> 02:12:56,120
Um,
so that's probably why you like it,

3155
02:12:56,121 --> 02:12:58,010
because it alleviates some of that 
anxiety.

3156
02:12:58,790 --> 02:12:59,623
Well,
there's things that happen in 

3157
02:13:00,621 --> 02:13:03,020
psychedelic drugs that make you more 
vulnerable.

3158
02:13:03,260 --> 02:13:04,071
Oh.
You know,

3159
02:13:04,071 --> 02:13:06,920
they make you aware.
Have you done molly?

3160
02:13:07,310 --> 02:13:09,380
Yes.
What do you think of that thing?

3161
02:13:09,440 --> 02:13:11,810
Um,
well Mtma which is molly,

3162
02:13:11,840 --> 02:13:12,673
you know,
same thing.

3163
02:13:12,710 --> 02:13:13,760
Uh,
the,

3164
02:13:14,210 --> 02:13:16,850
the after effects were way too brutal 
for me.

3165
02:13:17,540 --> 02:13:20,960
The Post Post trip,
the trip was wonderful.

3166
02:13:21,200 --> 02:13:22,033
Trip was amazing and I got some pretty 
deep insight about the nature of 

3167
02:13:25,551 --> 02:13:28,340
insecurities and how they manifest 
itself in social security.

3168
02:13:28,350 --> 02:13:29,890
May need the conversations.
Yeah.

3169
02:13:30,290 --> 02:13:32,640
But the next day,

3170
02:13:33,240 --> 02:13:35,070
um,
I couldn't read.

3171
02:13:35,370 --> 02:13:36,203
I remember I was at a coffee shop and I 
was trying to read a magazine and I was 

3172
02:13:38,971 --> 02:13:40,430
like,
I can't even fucking read.

3173
02:13:40,560 --> 02:13:42,360
Couldn't kind of constant trail.
Yeah.

3174
02:13:42,900 --> 02:13:46,200
And then I found out about,
that's before I had found out about htp,

3175
02:13:46,500 --> 02:13:48,000
five htp,
five htp,

3176
02:13:48,001 --> 02:13:48,834
which converts to Serotonin.
One of the things that serotonin 

3177
02:13:50,641 --> 02:13:51,870
depletion because of,
uh,

3178
02:13:52,200 --> 02:13:53,430
when you do,
uh,

3179
02:13:53,490 --> 02:13:56,010
Mtma,
what's happening is you get this massive

3180
02:13:56,011 --> 02:13:58,640
blast of Serotonin and you feel amazing.
Right.

3181
02:13:58,780 --> 02:13:59,191
Right.
Well,

3182
02:13:59,191 --> 02:14:02,000
after it's over,
that shit crashes and your,

3183
02:14:02,060 --> 02:14:04,530
your body body's depleted.
You feel like a dry sponge.

3184
02:14:04,531 --> 02:14:06,210
Like you don't feel good.
To me,

3185
02:14:06,211 --> 02:14:08,310
at least I,
I dry sponge that can't read.

3186
02:14:08,400 --> 02:14:09,030
Yeah.
I just,

3187
02:14:09,030 --> 02:14:13,650
my brain wasn't firing.
It just wasn't working well and I didn't

3188
02:14:13,680 --> 02:14:14,513
like,
it didn't like the feeling and it took 

3189
02:14:16,230 --> 02:14:20,160
at least a day or so from fruit to 
rebound and I was like,

3190
02:14:20,190 --> 02:14:21,023
not,
you're probably not going to do that 

3191
02:14:21,721 --> 02:14:22,050
again.

3192
02:14:22,050 --> 02:14:23,070
No,
no,

3193
02:14:23,100 --> 02:14:24,630
I don't think so.
Not Worth it.

3194
02:14:25,650 --> 02:14:27,900
The next day is just not worth it to me.
Okay.

3195
02:14:27,901 --> 02:14:30,150
Now,
and I've heard from some people that,

3196
02:14:30,380 --> 02:14:31,213
oh,
I have to get the pure stuff that it 

3197
02:14:32,401 --> 02:14:34,200
doesn't do it,
but the people that have heard that from

3198
02:14:34,201 --> 02:14:37,930
her all in poor health,
there's not,

3199
02:14:39,130 --> 02:14:40,230
yeah.
They don't,

3200
02:14:40,350 --> 02:14:41,183
the people that have talked to their 
healthy saying there's always a price 

3201
02:14:44,191 --> 02:14:47,040
you pay from the modeling.
Yeah.

3202
02:14:47,310 --> 02:14:49,170
There's not a price you pay for 
mushrooms.

3203
02:14:49,200 --> 02:14:50,033
I don't,
I've never felt a physical price for 

3204
02:14:50,831 --> 02:14:53,310
mushrooms.
There's zero physical price you pay from

3205
02:14:53,311 --> 02:14:54,420
dmt.
None.

3206
02:14:54,421 --> 02:14:55,254
Zero.
Some people have an issue with Iowasca 

3207
02:14:57,061 --> 02:15:00,930
because you purge and you'll do a lot of
throwing up and a lot of diarrhea.

3208
02:15:00,990 --> 02:15:02,670
That's why I'm not doing it.
That's it.

3209
02:15:03,120 --> 02:15:05,250
Well that's one of the reason I will,
I mean again,

3210
02:15:05,251 --> 02:15:06,570
I'm a drug experimenter.

3211
02:15:06,570 --> 02:15:09,300
I know everyone says that it's like a 
euphemism for,

3212
02:15:09,301 --> 02:15:10,134
I'm a drug user,
but I'm actually just like on the right 

3213
02:15:11,851 --> 02:15:12,684
circumstances.
I deal with drug even though it's not 

3214
02:15:15,031 --> 02:15:20,031
part of my life in any way.
So I don't like throwing up.

3215
02:15:20,130 --> 02:15:20,770
Yeah,
no.

3216
02:15:20,770 --> 02:15:21,603
What do you think?
He understands psychological now the 

3217
02:15:23,591 --> 02:15:24,424
stuff is disgusting.
Everybody that tells me they've tried 

3218
02:15:26,461 --> 02:15:29,970
Iowasca says it's fucking disgusting.
I don't want to go to the jungle.

3219
02:15:30,270 --> 02:15:31,830
And I mean I'm sure I could do it around
here,

3220
02:15:31,831 --> 02:15:35,040
but not in the bugs and snakes and 
Jaguars and all that shit.

3221
02:15:35,070 --> 02:15:37,530
You can go fuck yourself.
I'm not going to fucking rain forest.

3222
02:15:37,980 --> 02:15:38,813
No.
But people have had these amazing 

3223
02:15:40,051 --> 02:15:43,170
experiences cause they do it in the rain
forest and that's where it's from.

3224
02:15:43,171 --> 02:15:44,560
And See,
I'm also,

3225
02:15:44,640 --> 02:15:48,330
I hate to say this and this is going to 
sound prejudiced,

3226
02:15:48,840 --> 02:15:53,840
but I'm kind of an on people that what's
down that good Sam prejudice.

3227
02:15:55,500 --> 02:15:58,260
I'm sort of Anti Sharman.
Well,

3228
02:15:59,100 --> 02:16:03,210
there's a good reason to be because 
schamens are a lot like Yogis,

3229
02:16:03,570 --> 02:16:04,403
like a,
there's a lot of yogis that are really 

3230
02:16:06,301 --> 02:16:09,720
just douche bags that are trying to fuck
women that are in their classes.

3231
02:16:09,750 --> 02:16:10,583
Right.
And there's a lot of sham and that are 

3232
02:16:11,731 --> 02:16:12,564
like that.
And I feel like I have a pretty good 

3233
02:16:14,371 --> 02:16:15,690
radar about people.
Yeah,

3234
02:16:16,350 --> 02:16:17,183
that makes sense.
Thank type of people that want to be a 

3235
02:16:18,571 --> 02:16:19,404
showman boy who knows,
who knows what you're going to get 

3236
02:16:21,601 --> 02:16:23,150
there.
And Jen,

3237
02:16:23,300 --> 02:16:26,120
he was a friend of mine that was a sham 
and they used to do these rituals on his

3238
02:16:26,150 --> 02:16:27,660
resume.
Writers on his resume.

3239
02:16:27,690 --> 02:16:28,523
No,
but he was a,

3240
02:16:28,530 --> 02:16:30,970
he would guide them and these people 
through,

3241
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:31,833
uh,
these I wasco rituals and he wanted to 

3242
02:16:33,671 --> 02:16:35,320
do it with me.
He died.

3243
02:16:35,650 --> 02:16:37,930
I would,
I would definitely do IOWASCA.

3244
02:16:37,931 --> 02:16:41,350
And what Iowasca is,
is just a less intense,

3245
02:16:41,590 --> 02:16:45,880
longer lasting version of a DMT trip.
But the DM tree trip,

3246
02:16:45,910 --> 02:16:48,250
the Dow,
I'm more interested in DMT.

3247
02:16:48,430 --> 02:16:51,720
DMT is Iowasca Iowasca so you don't 
throw up the act.

3248
02:16:51,730 --> 02:16:52,600
No,
you don't throw up.

3249
02:16:53,120 --> 02:16:53,953
Yes,
you're smoking it and it goes directly 

3250
02:16:55,601 --> 02:16:58,180
to your bloodstream because what happens
instantaneously?

3251
02:16:58,300 --> 02:16:59,770
How many does he take?
Omni pump?

3252
02:16:59,830 --> 02:17:02,020
Three big hits,
a hit,

3253
02:17:02,080 --> 02:17:05,390
not even a puff.
Three is like number,

3254
02:17:05,470 --> 02:17:07,420
you'll hold it in now you take big hits.

3255
02:17:10,690 --> 02:17:11,523
Okay,

3256
02:17:12,840 --> 02:17:16,850
hit it again.
And then at the second one,

3257
02:17:16,851 --> 02:17:17,684
reality starts getting real fragile.
You start seeing things pixelate around 

3258
02:17:21,321 --> 02:17:23,090
you and,
but you gotta go one more time.

3259
02:17:23,091 --> 02:17:24,140
One more time,
one more time.

3260
02:17:28,070 --> 02:17:30,100
You put the pipe down,
lay down.

3261
02:17:31,250 --> 02:17:35,450
Oh,
okay.

3262
02:17:35,510 --> 02:17:36,343
And then it just overcomes you.
You go through the flower of life and 

3263
02:17:39,681 --> 02:17:40,514
enter into this massive,
infinite geometric pattern that's made 

3264
02:17:45,171 --> 02:17:47,960
out of love and understanding and you 
communicate with God.

3265
02:17:49,220 --> 02:17:50,720
And that's your definition of a good 
trip.

3266
02:17:50,930 --> 02:17:54,350
It's pretty intense.
It can be terrifying to some people.

3267
02:17:54,351 --> 02:17:55,184
It definitely is terrifying if you try 
to control it and manipulate it because 

3268
02:17:58,761 --> 02:18:02,330
then you're going to be in a wrestling 
match with your emotions and your mind.

3269
02:18:02,331 --> 02:18:03,164
You have to be able to let go.
It's one of the most difficult things 

3270
02:18:04,971 --> 02:18:05,804
with any really intense at breaks.
And you're saying psychedelic 

3271
02:18:08,451 --> 02:18:10,340
experience,
you gotta be willing to let go.

3272
02:18:10,370 --> 02:18:12,870
How would you compare it to,
because I've only done mushrooms.

3273
02:18:12,890 --> 02:18:13,490
How many?
Well,

3274
02:18:13,490 --> 02:18:15,260
you say you've done mushrooms when you 
saved,

3275
02:18:15,261 --> 02:18:15,861
done mushrooms.
Well,

3276
02:18:15,861 --> 02:18:18,570
what kind of dose are you talking about?
Well,

3277
02:18:18,571 --> 02:18:20,270
aid.
I hate the taste of it,

3278
02:18:20,271 --> 02:18:22,010
so I put it in a big Mac and I get him.

3279
02:18:23,390 --> 02:18:24,223
Oh God.
That might be the worst way to take 

3280
02:18:28,430 --> 02:18:29,800
mushrooms I've ever heard.
No.

3281
02:18:29,801 --> 02:18:32,270
I kind of big Mac,
kind of like fucking big Mac.

3282
02:18:32,360 --> 02:18:33,520
Yeah.
Have you ever had one of those?

3283
02:18:33,590 --> 02:18:34,730
No.
Mcdonald's?

3284
02:18:35,270 --> 02:18:36,410
Yeah,
but why would you do that?

3285
02:18:36,411 --> 02:18:38,510
Why would you delete mushrooms in a big 
Mac?

3286
02:18:38,540 --> 02:18:42,170
Because I love big MACs.
What are you judging?

3287
02:18:42,171 --> 02:18:44,060
Big macs now.
It's so bad for you.

3288
02:18:44,061 --> 02:18:46,100
It's factory farmed.
This bucket.

3289
02:18:46,101 --> 02:18:49,880
Tortured cow.
Taking them in with the mother Gaia.

3290
02:18:50,870 --> 02:18:51,703
Wow.
Maybe it was just that was my 

3291
02:18:52,491 --> 02:18:53,324
experience.
What if I said times I said dug in and 

3292
02:18:55,881 --> 02:18:57,210
out Burger,
we'd deputy better.

3293
02:18:57,680 --> 02:18:59,540
Not really.
We still,

3294
02:18:59,570 --> 02:19:01,460
they're much more delicious.
What about from the counter?

3295
02:19:01,470 --> 02:19:03,350
What if I got our cheeseburger from the 
counter,

3296
02:19:03,790 --> 02:19:05,840
the bride at home?
Because what I did,

3297
02:19:05,841 --> 02:19:06,674
I kind of spinning.
Even supposed to eat meat for days 

3298
02:19:08,211 --> 02:19:10,640
before you do mushrooms.
That's not true.

3299
02:19:10,700 --> 02:19:11,720
It is.
Yeah.

3300
02:19:12,220 --> 02:19:13,053
The rule is that people that get the 
most out of the experience recommend 

3301
02:19:18,080 --> 02:19:18,913
that you,
you have a vegetable only diet for at 

3302
02:19:22,521 --> 02:19:26,220
least 24 hours before you do any 
question.

3303
02:19:26,660 --> 02:19:28,490
Let's say meeting just salads

3304
02:19:28,490 --> 02:19:30,920
and my lead up thousand island dressing.
Cause that's a question.

3305
02:19:30,950 --> 02:19:33,890
That's my favorite dressing sugar in 
that I avoid sugar.

3306
02:19:34,370 --> 02:19:36,950
I would say avoid sugar.
So just like a vinegarette,

3307
02:19:36,951 --> 02:19:39,170
avoid toxins.
Avoid Nasty Shit.

3308
02:19:39,200 --> 02:19:41,390
Oil and vinegar.
You know what I'm drinking.

3309
02:19:41,420 --> 02:19:42,253
You see what I'm drink coca cola.
It's not good for the greatest thing 

3310
02:19:44,541 --> 02:19:44,961
ever,
man.

3311
02:19:44,961 --> 02:19:48,350
Ever meant to mix it with Jack Daniels.
Some ice,

3312
02:19:48,920 --> 02:19:49,753
I'll suddenly nuts,
but I want to know what kind of dose 

3313
02:19:52,430 --> 02:19:53,263
you're you're taking.
I don't know that you kind of mushrooms 

3314
02:19:54,901 --> 02:19:55,734
like put it,
open your hand up and show me how many 

3315
02:19:56,991 --> 02:20:00,560
mushrooms you're talking about.
I would say fit like in here.

3316
02:20:00,590 --> 02:20:01,700
Oh,
you're not doing anything.

3317
02:20:01,701 --> 02:20:02,110
You,
you,

3318
02:20:02,110 --> 02:20:06,950
you have a baby doses so you're not even
experiencing the dissolving of reality.

3319
02:20:07,550 --> 02:20:09,620
No,
I was just trying to have a good time.

3320
02:20:11,180 --> 02:20:12,013
Yeah,
the real that was my goal is they have 

3321
02:20:14,650 --> 02:20:15,680
mushroom chips.

3322
02:20:15,980 --> 02:20:19,490
The real mushroom trips only get a few 
drinks.

3323
02:20:19,520 --> 02:20:22,280
They get again,
what do you mean dissolve the solving of

3324
02:20:22,281 --> 02:20:25,070
reality?
That's the goal of being on mushrooms.

3325
02:20:25,190 --> 02:20:26,001
Not like,
oh,

3326
02:20:26,001 --> 02:20:29,210
I'm going to see aerosmith at the 
Hollywood bowl and you could do that.

3327
02:20:29,240 --> 02:20:31,220
That's the way I do that.
There's nothing wrong with that.

3328
02:20:31,221 --> 02:20:32,300
Okay,
so tell what I'm saying.

3329
02:20:32,301 --> 02:20:35,030
If you want something that's 
commensurate with a dmt experience,

3330
02:20:35,031 --> 02:20:35,864
you're going to have to take five grams.
You're going to have to take a large 

3331
02:20:38,240 --> 02:20:39,073
dose,
but it seemed like it was part of the 

3332
02:20:40,011 --> 02:20:43,240
mushroom that was like potent and other 
was just like little short,

3333
02:20:43,730 --> 02:20:47,780
five grams of the potent stuff you need.
You need the real deal.

3334
02:20:47,900 --> 02:20:50,390
Okay.
I didn't wait it out.

3335
02:20:50,930 --> 02:20:51,741
I mean,
you look,

3336
02:20:51,741 --> 02:20:54,110
you could,
depending upon the,

3337
02:20:54,170 --> 02:20:57,440
can you see?
How do you eat the mushrooms?

3338
02:20:57,680 --> 02:20:59,940
Just fucking eat a man like chill.
Yeah,

3339
02:20:59,950 --> 02:21:00,783
you eat them.

3340
02:21:02,730 --> 02:21:04,640
You're saying this like this is so 
alien.

3341
02:21:05,120 --> 02:21:07,850
Well,
I just found the taste so horrific.

3342
02:21:07,851 --> 02:21:12,140
That's why I hit it into a delicious big
Mac and the other next time I did it I,

3343
02:21:12,141 --> 02:21:13,760
this is what I did.
Tasteless.

3344
02:21:13,870 --> 02:21:17,570
They don't taste horrible at all.
You got to be kidding me.

3345
02:21:17,890 --> 02:21:18,920
No,
like literally.

3346
02:21:18,921 --> 02:21:23,921
If we go on the Internet right now and 
put up the taste of mushrooms,

3347
02:21:24,501 --> 02:21:26,000
everyone was going to say it's 
tasteless.

3348
02:21:26,050 --> 02:21:28,580
Go to [inaudible] dot com that's my 
website.

3349
02:21:32,210 --> 02:21:34,890
Driving traffic to my website.
[inaudible] had a problem with the tape.

3350
02:21:34,940 --> 02:21:36,710
No one's ever,
wait a minute.

3351
02:21:36,830 --> 02:21:39,140
I'm sure some people don't like the 
taste.

3352
02:21:39,141 --> 02:21:41,620
I've never heard you say about me 
earlier today.

3353
02:21:41,660 --> 02:21:43,310
I'm sensitive.
You're a little bit sensitive.

3354
02:21:43,311 --> 02:21:45,070
I'm a little bit sensitive,
so maybe she's our us.

3355
02:21:45,071 --> 02:21:46,220
Does that hurt?
Does that hurt you?

3356
02:21:46,221 --> 02:21:47,060
No,
not at all.

3357
02:21:47,450 --> 02:21:48,070
Great.
I it's,

3358
02:21:48,070 --> 02:21:49,130
it's,
it's branded.

3359
02:21:49,180 --> 02:21:52,990
I branded well,
what has happened if you go to pussies?

3360
02:21:53,080 --> 02:21:54,370
RFCS got to be a porn site.
Right?

3361
02:21:54,420 --> 02:21:55,253
It's probably just like gaping fucking 
people throwing quarters down their 

3362
02:21:58,161 --> 02:21:58,994
whole,
so,

3363
02:21:59,670 --> 02:22:00,790
all right.
All right.

3364
02:22:00,791 --> 02:22:01,611
Um,
okay.

3365
02:22:01,611 --> 02:22:04,140
So,
um,

3366
02:22:04,170 --> 02:22:06,980
hand believe because everyone I've ever 
spoken to,

3367
02:22:06,981 --> 02:22:07,814
with the exception of a guy named Joe 
Rogan as talked about how horrible 

3368
02:22:11,361 --> 02:22:12,730
mushrooms days,
they don't care.

3369
02:22:13,270 --> 02:22:15,890
Well,
I understand that.

3370
02:22:15,950 --> 02:22:17,340
I believe you,
but uh,

3371
02:22:17,360 --> 02:22:19,940
I've never found them to taste bad.
They just taste,

3372
02:22:20,300 --> 02:22:21,133
they kind tastes like cardboard or 
something or plasticky they don't taste 

3373
02:22:25,050 --> 02:22:25,800
like much.
I mean,

3374
02:22:25,800 --> 02:22:26,010
they

3375
02:22:26,010 --> 02:22:26,843
got,
I hadn't mushrooms three or four months 

3376
02:22:29,401 --> 02:22:31,200
ago.
They didn't taste that bad.

3377
02:22:31,230 --> 02:22:33,390
Okay.
We're gonna lose to me too.

3378
02:22:33,400 --> 02:22:34,111
It's okay.
I mean,

3379
02:22:34,111 --> 02:22:35,520
it's not something I would look forward 
to.

3380
02:22:35,521 --> 02:22:37,320
Like,
it's not like pistachios.

3381
02:22:37,610 --> 02:22:38,580
I go,
Ooh,

3382
02:22:38,610 --> 02:22:41,700
let me take some of these,
but not that bad.

3383
02:22:41,760 --> 02:22:42,571
Okay.
All right.

3384
02:22:42,571 --> 02:22:44,760
Let me pick a deal.
We'll let that,

3385
02:22:44,761 --> 02:22:46,480
we'll let that lie below.
Kind of like,

3386
02:22:46,500 --> 02:22:47,333
I do think you're wrong about that.
I just want to get this word wrong 

3387
02:22:49,741 --> 02:22:50,574
thing.
There's probably some things that you 

3388
02:22:51,991 --> 02:22:54,410
enjoy that I don't like obviously.
Right.

3389
02:22:54,570 --> 02:22:57,810
How you feel about gefilte fish.
Okay.

3390
02:22:58,050 --> 02:22:59,970
Of all the things that we're going to 
come out of your mouth.

3391
02:23:00,240 --> 02:23:02,580
That was when the last things I can eat 
it.

3392
02:23:02,640 --> 02:23:03,960
It's not great.
Okay.

3393
02:23:04,110 --> 02:23:05,610
I can agree with that.
I can eat it,

3394
02:23:05,611 --> 02:23:06,444
but there's a fermented,
the least favorite part is the jelly 

3395
02:23:09,061 --> 02:23:09,300
part.

3396
02:23:09,300 --> 02:23:11,550
I get rid of that.
But the actual fish I can deal with,

3397
02:23:11,551 --> 02:23:12,384
there's a fermented shark that people 
eat in Iceland that is supposed to be 

3398
02:23:15,811 --> 02:23:19,710
fucking horrific for anyone else other 
than the people that live in Iceland.

3399
02:23:20,590 --> 02:23:22,200
It was one of the few things that,
uh,

3400
02:23:22,230 --> 02:23:27,230
Anthony Bordain told me that like was 
like truly disgusting that uh,

3401
02:23:27,991 --> 02:23:29,270
he eight on his show,
you know,

3402
02:23:29,310 --> 02:23:30,143
when he used to travel and go to these 
different places and try their local 

3403
02:23:32,760 --> 02:23:34,520
cuisine,
um,

3404
02:23:34,800 --> 02:23:37,770
fermented shark supposed to be fucking 
awful.

3405
02:23:38,010 --> 02:23:38,761
But uh,
they,

3406
02:23:38,761 --> 02:23:39,720
they enjoy it.
You know,

3407
02:23:39,721 --> 02:23:40,554
so it regional,
you're saying there's regionalisms when 

3408
02:23:42,391 --> 02:23:43,410
it comes to taste?
Yeah,

3409
02:23:43,411 --> 02:23:44,700
for sure.
Yeah.

3410
02:23:45,930 --> 02:23:46,763
Okay.
Now I'm not going to talk about my diet 

3411
02:23:47,400 --> 02:23:49,050
cause you're going to hate it.
You're going to die.

3412
02:23:49,051 --> 02:23:50,180
What do you do?
What do you,

3413
02:23:50,250 --> 02:23:51,810
what do you think?
Big macs.

3414
02:23:51,890 --> 02:23:52,723
It's all big MACs.

3415
02:23:52,780 --> 02:23:53,613
It's not all big macs,
but I think a lot of shit you would 

3416
02:23:55,881 --> 02:23:56,970
consider shitty food.
Right?

3417
02:23:56,980 --> 02:23:59,210
Think you're overreacting to it.
You think I'm overreacting?

3418
02:24:00,680 --> 02:24:02,840
Well what is shitty food then?
If that's not shitty food.

3419
02:24:03,440 --> 02:24:04,273
I feel like,
I feel like if people during the 

3420
02:24:06,021 --> 02:24:06,854
depression could get a 99 cent 
cheeseburger when people were so poor 

3421
02:24:11,121 --> 02:24:15,650
that they couldn't even afford meat,
like big it maybe meet once a month.

3422
02:24:15,740 --> 02:24:17,420
Right.
And that was the worst of it.

3423
02:24:17,600 --> 02:24:20,660
Some risks get thing that people would 
be like,

3424
02:24:20,810 --> 02:24:23,060
they would have thought it was the 
greatest thing on earth.

3425
02:24:23,390 --> 02:24:24,223
And I think they,
these cheeseburgers that we get be at 

3426
02:24:26,451 --> 02:24:28,610
the quarter pounder with cheese,
be it the double,

3427
02:24:28,611 --> 02:24:31,880
double it in and out,
be at the uh,

3428
02:24:32,960 --> 02:24:34,760
like a pretty good,
I think they're pretty good food.

3429
02:24:34,761 --> 02:24:37,130
I know the factory farmed,
I get it.

3430
02:24:37,610 --> 02:24:40,630
I get it there that it seems horrible.

3431
02:24:41,050 --> 02:24:42,460
I'll re,
I'll re ask the question,

3432
02:24:42,820 --> 02:24:45,730
what is bad then if that's what is bad 
food?

3433
02:24:45,780 --> 02:24:47,050
What is bad food?
Yeah.

3434
02:24:47,051 --> 02:24:50,120
What's bad food for you?
I would say food that is uh,

3435
02:24:50,720 --> 02:24:54,880
has gone rotten just has to be boiled 
milk.

3436
02:24:54,910 --> 02:24:58,840
It has to be like literally poisonous 
and rotting.

3437
02:24:58,841 --> 02:25:00,680
Yeah.
For you to think it's bad for the yes.

3438
02:25:01,130 --> 02:25:02,260
Yes.
That's a good question.

3439
02:25:02,261 --> 02:25:03,094
No one's asked me that necessarily.
What I would consider a health 

3440
02:25:05,531 --> 02:25:06,364
conscious.

3441
02:25:06,460 --> 02:25:10,480
I am super health conscious.
I just believe the negative,

3442
02:25:12,040 --> 02:25:13,740
uh,
what's the word for it?

3443
02:25:14,320 --> 02:25:17,800
The negativity actions that are 
overblown known

3444
02:25:18,020 --> 02:25:18,853
by people that by people,
the negative repercussions of eating 

3445
02:25:22,221 --> 02:25:23,054
cheeseburgers,
eating cheeseburgers or pizza or 

3446
02:25:25,331 --> 02:25:28,000
something like that.
Having a pizza or going to,

3447
02:25:29,610 --> 02:25:31,900
and I getting a,
okay,

3448
02:25:31,901 --> 02:25:32,734
forget about the rotten stuff.
That is what you're talking about is 

3449
02:25:35,651 --> 02:25:38,830
literally the worst aspects of the 
American diet other than sugar.

3450
02:25:38,860 --> 02:25:41,020
I know I've read that you're drinking 
sugar.

3451
02:25:41,021 --> 02:25:42,070
I don't know what book you're talking 
about,

3452
02:25:42,071 --> 02:25:44,380
but you're drinking a can of sugar that 
has,

3453
02:25:45,190 --> 02:25:49,300
I want to say let's 40 grams of sugar 
per can.

3454
02:25:49,330 --> 02:25:51,040
How many grams?
Not even close.

3455
02:25:51,041 --> 02:25:54,700
39 again,
exaggerating.

3456
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:58,210
This is the point I'm trying to make joe
not even close.

3457
02:26:01,140 --> 02:26:03,070
That's a lot of fucking sugar,
man.

3458
02:26:03,130 --> 02:26:05,470
Yeah.
You're only supposed to eat 25 a day.

3459
02:26:05,530 --> 02:26:06,480
A day.
Yeah.

3460
02:26:06,490 --> 02:26:07,600
25 gram.
Who?

3461
02:26:07,720 --> 02:26:09,510
Who says that?
Yeah.

3462
02:26:09,520 --> 02:26:11,830
That's on there.
The lambs a protein though.

3463
02:26:11,860 --> 02:26:12,693
That's how much fat in here.
How much fan in here isn't have Tony's 

3464
02:26:14,471 --> 02:26:17,740
back towards to fat zero.
It doesn't matter.

3465
02:26:17,800 --> 02:26:19,600
Protean it's going to go right to your 
gut.

3466
02:26:19,720 --> 02:26:20,950
I'll let sugar.
Well,

3467
02:26:22,180 --> 02:26:24,460
insulin spike from what you understand 
is that we,

3468
02:26:24,461 --> 02:26:26,800
you're going to want to understand that 
when you gain weight,

3469
02:26:26,801 --> 02:26:29,290
it doesn't go to one place.
It goes all over that way.

3470
02:26:29,320 --> 02:26:32,050
That way you can't spot reduce.
I think I'm correct on that.

3471
02:26:32,500 --> 02:26:33,311
Uh,
yeah,

3472
02:26:33,311 --> 02:26:34,144
but some people have an inclination to 
gain more gut fat where some will gain 

3473
02:26:37,271 --> 02:26:40,360
it and unfortunate areas,
I do like their ass.

3474
02:26:40,390 --> 02:26:41,223
Right.
Some people go to the girls worth their 

3475
02:26:41,781 --> 02:26:42,810
ass.
Yeah.

3476
02:26:42,820 --> 02:26:45,670
I mean this is no a consensus,
right?

3477
02:26:45,900 --> 02:26:46,631
Yeah.
No,

3478
02:26:46,631 --> 02:26:47,560
no.
I believe me.

3479
02:26:47,860 --> 02:26:51,670
You're not the only one that is not 
happy with my diet.

3480
02:26:51,730 --> 02:26:53,080
Who else isn't happy with you.
Dot.

3481
02:26:53,780 --> 02:26:55,240
You know,
people who are well read,

3482
02:26:55,810 --> 02:26:58,570
people understand diet people are 
Dietitians.

3483
02:26:58,630 --> 02:27:00,850
So back to her solid,
the you.

3484
02:27:01,300 --> 02:27:02,133
So all this stuff when you're talking 
about like pizza and cheeseburgers and 

3485
02:27:05,231 --> 02:27:06,130
sugar,
that's,

3486
02:27:06,160 --> 02:27:09,160
that's the kind of things that people 
had ever had.

3487
02:27:09,161 --> 02:27:10,900
Chinese food,
I like that.

3488
02:27:11,430 --> 02:27:13,420
It's delicious.
There's the reason why it's popular.

3489
02:27:13,540 --> 02:27:14,740
Right?
Right.

3490
02:27:14,770 --> 02:27:17,530
I like delicious things.
Just basic tick.

3491
02:27:17,890 --> 02:27:18,723
Yeah,
me too.

3492
02:27:18,910 --> 02:27:19,743
I just don't allow myself to have them 
very often as it's not more disciplined 

3493
02:27:22,811 --> 02:27:24,460
than I am.
Maybe.

3494
02:27:24,800 --> 02:27:26,320
Yeah,
probably.

3495
02:27:26,350 --> 02:27:27,183
I think that's been sort of the theme,
the theme of my life as far as like 

3496
02:27:30,551 --> 02:27:34,780
getting things done has always been 
about forcing myself to work.

3497
02:27:34,900 --> 02:27:36,310
You know,
that's uh,

3498
02:27:36,370 --> 02:27:38,350
I,
I think especially Comedians,

3499
02:27:38,351 --> 02:27:41,500
one of the things about what we do is 
that it's so open ended.

3500
02:27:41,501 --> 02:27:43,060
Like no one can tell us what to do.
Like,

3501
02:27:43,330 --> 02:27:45,970
I don't know how your schedule works,
but me,

3502
02:27:45,971 --> 02:27:50,140
I call into the comedy store on Monday 
and I can decide how many days I want to

3503
02:27:50,141 --> 02:27:51,520
put in for,
I can say,

3504
02:27:51,550 --> 02:27:53,980
oh,
I'll do Tuesday and Friday,

3505
02:27:53,981 --> 02:27:55,810
Saturday.
So I'll take Wednesday and Thursday off.

3506
02:27:55,830 --> 02:27:57,040
It's,
it's totally up to me.

3507
02:27:57,070 --> 02:27:59,380
Right.
And I think that's how we all are.

3508
02:27:59,381 --> 02:28:01,840
We can decide like when to work and when
not to work.

3509
02:28:02,260 --> 02:28:03,093
But there's a big,
there's a direct connection between 

3510
02:28:06,610 --> 02:28:11,140
forcing yourself to write more and 
perform more and your act getting better

3511
02:28:11,320 --> 02:28:13,600
and you're getting more work and your,
your,

3512
02:28:13,601 --> 02:28:16,240
your comedy career progressing.
And so for me,

3513
02:28:17,020 --> 02:28:17,853
the discipline that I applied to s two 
fighting and martial arts and other 

3514
02:28:22,311 --> 02:28:24,830
things and to continue to stay fit and 
work out,

3515
02:28:25,130 --> 02:28:26,300
I applied to comedy too.

3516
02:28:26,330 --> 02:28:29,730
I just make yourself go do the thing.
But the,

3517
02:28:29,930 --> 02:28:30,763
the natural inclination of really funny 
people is often to fuck off is often to 

3518
02:28:34,851 --> 02:28:35,684
be lazy.
But I don't think that they're mutually 

3519
02:28:36,981 --> 02:28:40,700
exclusive.
I think you can be disciplined but still

3520
02:28:40,701 --> 02:28:41,534
have the same sort of comedic instincts.
You just have to know when to turn it 

3521
02:28:44,221 --> 02:28:46,490
out and when to turn it off and when it 
benefits you.

3522
02:28:47,450 --> 02:28:50,790
I think you'd done,
yeah.

3523
02:28:51,890 --> 02:28:54,340
Like then you go off on this things.
Uh,

3524
02:28:55,340 --> 02:28:57,170
I agree with the,
I agree with you 100%.

3525
02:28:57,200 --> 02:29:01,220
I admire your discipline.
I feel like I'm not as disciplined to do

3526
02:29:01,221 --> 02:29:02,054
you want a little more discipline.
Although people who look at me are 

3527
02:29:04,131 --> 02:29:06,850
always like,
you accomplish more because of the Dayak

3528
02:29:06,870 --> 02:29:09,470
they did things that go on the road.
I just stand up.

3529
02:29:09,830 --> 02:29:11,600
I write books,
I write articles.

3530
02:29:11,840 --> 02:29:13,430
Um,
but I,

3531
02:29:13,550 --> 02:29:14,383
I know I'm not disciplined,
but you're more disciplined than a lot 

3532
02:29:17,721 --> 02:29:18,590
of other comics.

3533
02:29:19,460 --> 02:29:20,720
I know,
I just know me,

3534
02:29:20,780 --> 02:29:24,200
but we all know comics like especially 
are just getting high all day.

3535
02:29:24,201 --> 02:29:28,520
I know that's not only that we all know 
the tragic stories of the guys who wrote

3536
02:29:28,521 --> 02:29:32,690
an hour in like 1996 or,
and never fucking adjusted it.

3537
02:29:32,691 --> 02:29:33,524
And they had real promise.
There's guys that are doing the same 

3538
02:29:35,931 --> 02:29:39,590
fucking jokes that you and I both know,
they've been doing the same jokes for 20

3539
02:29:39,591 --> 02:29:40,424
years and they still are.
And you can go and catch them at the 

3540
02:29:43,041 --> 02:29:43,874
fucking laugh factory tomorrow night and
they'll tell a joke from the late 

3541
02:29:46,910 --> 02:29:47,660
nineties.
Right?

3542
02:29:47,660 --> 02:29:48,680
I mean,
there's those guys,

3543
02:29:48,710 --> 02:29:52,280
they exist and a lot of those guys had 
massive potential.

3544
02:29:52,550 --> 02:29:55,490
Like they were really good.
But I think,

3545
02:29:55,550 --> 02:29:56,383
I know you're blaming,
some of it is obviously discipline and 

3546
02:29:59,931 --> 02:30:01,760
the,
but I think it goes back to what we said

3547
02:30:01,761 --> 02:30:05,600
earlier about the risk of doing new 
material for sure.

3548
02:30:05,690 --> 02:30:07,860
But he's just part of disciplines when 
you understand.

3549
02:30:07,861 --> 02:30:10,670
But there's a pain involved with it.
And maybe with your,

3550
02:30:11,210 --> 02:30:12,043
just,
I'm just hypothesizing here that if 

3551
02:30:14,151 --> 02:30:18,980
you're a comedian and you love the 
attention and the approval,

3552
02:30:19,220 --> 02:30:20,053
that that overwhelms your desire to 
write new material and go through that 

3553
02:30:24,561 --> 02:30:26,570
pain process.
Yeah,

3554
02:30:27,030 --> 02:30:29,870
that's right.
There's definitely some excuses that you

3555
02:30:29,871 --> 02:30:31,570
can make for why people don't.
Right.

3556
02:30:31,850 --> 02:30:34,400
I think that's why Eddie Murphy doesn't 
do stand up by the way.

3557
02:30:34,790 --> 02:30:37,610
Well I think he's the,
the thing where he got caught with those

3558
02:30:37,611 --> 02:30:40,040
transvestite prostitutes.
That's not wet.

3559
02:30:40,041 --> 02:30:42,260
I think it is at all.
I think that's 100% where it is.

3560
02:30:42,261 --> 02:30:44,690
Cause that's when he stopped.
No,

3561
02:30:44,691 --> 02:30:47,840
we get stopped before then.
It's stopped doing standup before then,

3562
02:30:47,910 --> 02:30:48,820
honey.
Yeah.

3563
02:30:49,570 --> 02:30:51,230
You know,
he's had been caught a few times.

3564
02:30:51,500 --> 02:30:52,333
Okay.
This idol,

3565
02:30:52,550 --> 02:30:55,850
this is not a mat out he,
Nettie Murphy and doubting anything.

3566
02:30:55,890 --> 02:30:57,620
This is all,
this is all news.

3567
02:30:58,240 --> 02:31:00,140
It happened.
I thought that happened just once.

3568
02:31:00,950 --> 02:31:03,800
I have a friend who's a cop and I know 
some things.

3569
02:31:04,290 --> 02:31:05,360
Yeah,
that you know what they call them?

3570
02:31:05,361 --> 02:31:08,170
Dragons.
Your police officer friends,

3571
02:31:08,240 --> 02:31:10,940
they'd call it the drag queens to call 
them dragons.

3572
02:31:11,480 --> 02:31:15,500
That you see them picking up dragons.
See that movie tangerine by any chance?

3573
02:31:15,800 --> 02:31:16,633
No.
What's that?

3574
02:31:17,150 --> 02:31:18,890
It's about dragons.
Really?

3575
02:31:18,930 --> 02:31:19,763
Yeah.
No.

3576
02:31:19,830 --> 02:31:20,020
Did

3577
02:31:20,020 --> 02:31:20,853
she does it good?
[inaudible] Dragon Hyphen Shat on an 

3578
02:31:24,091 --> 02:31:24,960
iphone.
What's that?

3579
02:31:25,490 --> 02:31:28,080
Edwards is in her best friend,
Ian Edwards,

3580
02:31:28,081 --> 02:31:28,914
who you go see soccer matches.
The width is in that movie and is 

3581
02:31:31,830 --> 02:31:32,663
excellent in it.
He did you see and is excellent and 

3582
02:31:35,071 --> 02:31:36,000
everything.
Yeah.

3583
02:31:36,001 --> 02:31:38,810
He's a townsie comic.
Funny too talented comics.

3584
02:31:39,250 --> 02:31:41,430
Oh Sweetie.
He's eats really healthy.

3585
02:31:41,550 --> 02:31:45,330
He does sort of more than you is Vegan,
but he's really,

3586
02:31:46,260 --> 02:31:46,920
no,
no,

3587
02:31:46,920 --> 02:31:49,800
but he's very disciplined with it,
but he doesn't supplement.

3588
02:31:49,830 --> 02:31:50,663
Like if you are going to go Vegan,
you really have to take be 12 and d 

3589
02:31:53,041 --> 02:31:56,760
three is,
it's very hard to get m and D for ever.

3590
02:31:57,120 --> 02:31:58,410
[inaudible] no.
Yeah,

3591
02:31:58,411 --> 02:31:59,920
that's the good one.
No,

3592
02:32:00,870 --> 02:32:02,220
I don't even know if that's it that I 
don't think it's,

3593
02:32:02,280 --> 02:32:03,840
I don't take stuff.
Mine might be a thing.

3594
02:32:03,841 --> 02:32:05,520
I take d three d three.
Yeah.

3595
02:32:05,670 --> 02:32:07,140
But uh,
he doesn't,

3596
02:32:07,141 --> 02:32:07,974
uh,
doesn't supplement and I just really 

3597
02:32:09,301 --> 02:32:11,220
tried to get them to do that cause he's 
always tired.

3598
02:32:11,400 --> 02:32:12,233
So he's napping,
warn the cars on the way to gigs is 

3599
02:32:13,920 --> 02:32:16,290
fucking falling asleep and shit cause 
that him in the movie.

3600
02:32:16,700 --> 02:32:17,341
Hmm.
Anyway.

3601
02:32:17,341 --> 02:32:18,630
Shot on an iphone.
Those are,

3602
02:32:19,140 --> 02:32:21,030
yeah.
That's a couple of dragons as you'd like

3603
02:32:21,031 --> 02:32:22,830
to call.
I've never heard that expression before.

3604
02:32:23,190 --> 02:32:25,980
And it's interesting little low budget 
movie.

3605
02:32:26,580 --> 02:32:27,413
Well at least fucking phones are way 
better than the film cameras that they 

3606
02:32:30,331 --> 02:32:32,310
use 20 years ago.
I mean we,

3607
02:32:32,311 --> 02:32:33,144
you can get off of a phone now.
The images and the crystal clear images 

3608
02:32:36,571 --> 02:32:40,260
off of just a regular iphone six,
they're fucking phenomenal.

3609
02:32:40,500 --> 02:32:41,520
I mean,
no question.

3610
02:32:41,620 --> 02:32:42,453
No,
but I don't know if they're better than 

3611
02:32:43,690 --> 02:32:44,523
a good camera with the,
it's the lenses that were amazing on 

3612
02:32:46,921 --> 02:32:47,754
those cameras.
But I guarantee you you could get a 

3613
02:32:50,701 --> 02:32:53,970
video camera from a video camera.
Yeah.

3614
02:32:54,060 --> 02:32:54,841
Oh yeah.
Oh,

3615
02:32:54,841 --> 02:32:55,890
you mean like a film camera?

3616
02:32:55,890 --> 02:32:57,360
Like the camera?
Yeah,

3617
02:32:57,900 --> 02:33:02,430
no,
I meant like something nice video.

3618
02:33:02,610 --> 02:33:04,630
Well,
it's interesting because when nobody was

3619
02:33:04,631 --> 02:33:06,150
one of the whole thing on this.
Yeah.

3620
02:33:06,240 --> 02:33:09,450
But you could do that pretty well.
But I actually think the five,

3621
02:33:09,720 --> 02:33:11,340
what's interesting about,
um,

3622
02:33:12,330 --> 02:33:13,163
like phones and digital is that it shows
you the entire image as opposed to 

3623
02:33:18,360 --> 02:33:21,390
focusing on the center or the for the 
front.

3624
02:33:21,391 --> 02:33:22,830
And then everything in the background is
blurry,

3625
02:33:23,100 --> 02:33:25,170
which is what a lot of people like about
film,

3626
02:33:25,440 --> 02:33:26,273
about doing movies with film is that you
would have the shallow focus field 

3627
02:33:29,520 --> 02:33:30,331
yelling.
Yeah.

3628
02:33:30,331 --> 02:33:32,070
And it's kind of,
it really keeps your,

3629
02:33:32,100 --> 02:33:35,610
it's almost like the way you think.
You see things in real life.

3630
02:33:35,790 --> 02:33:37,610
Like if I'm looking at you in real life,
I,

3631
02:33:37,740 --> 02:33:39,570
I note that there's background behind 
you,

3632
02:33:39,571 --> 02:33:41,220
but I'm not really seeing it very 
clearly.

3633
02:33:41,230 --> 02:33:41,940
I see you.

3634
02:33:41,940 --> 02:33:43,980
And then I see Elvis Presley,
right.

3635
02:33:44,250 --> 02:33:46,080
Visiting President Nixon.
Right.

3636
02:33:46,230 --> 02:33:48,690
Did you ever see Presley perform?
No.

3637
02:33:48,691 --> 02:33:51,180
Not Live.
No.

3638
02:33:51,590 --> 02:33:52,950
No.
But I was just,

3639
02:33:53,100 --> 02:33:54,510
do you know,
they just released that movie.

3640
02:33:54,511 --> 02:33:55,344
They digitally rerelease the film,
a concert film of his comeback and a in 

3641
02:33:58,831 --> 02:34:01,460
Vegas.
Wait there,

3642
02:34:01,540 --> 02:34:05,070
I'm gonna be talking about the film from
1970 yeah,

3643
02:34:05,680 --> 02:34:06,513
digitally remastered it and that was at 
the movies recently and they had a 

3644
02:34:09,210 --> 02:34:10,043
trail.
A view.

3645
02:34:10,060 --> 02:34:11,970
But yeah,
look fucking crazy.

3646
02:34:11,971 --> 02:34:12,804
They did.
They want you to do one of those nights 

3647
02:34:13,771 --> 02:34:17,220
in the theater with yeah,
and he was dancing.

3648
02:34:17,290 --> 02:34:18,060
What was really crazy.

3649
02:34:18,060 --> 02:34:21,050
It's watching women react to him to 
still just scream.

3650
02:34:21,800 --> 02:34:22,251
No,
no,

3651
02:34:22,251 --> 02:34:23,084
not to women today.
The women back then screaming and 

3652
02:34:25,991 --> 02:34:27,580
falling down.
They didn't even,

3653
02:34:27,820 --> 02:34:28,653
they didn't even like you think about 
like how much bigger a star he was then 

3654
02:34:32,771 --> 02:34:33,604
anybody could ever be a star.
Today is cause like people are used to 

3655
02:34:36,490 --> 02:34:37,323
social media and video and snapchat and 
this and that and there's a million 

3656
02:34:42,311 --> 02:34:43,144
different stars and there's a million 
different movies and there's a fucking 

3657
02:34:45,491 --> 02:34:48,910
hundred thousand television shows and 
you have 290 channels.

3658
02:34:48,911 --> 02:34:51,610
They're constantly running and this all,
all this information data,

3659
02:34:51,611 --> 02:34:52,444
it's not special anymore.
Back then there was two fucking 

3660
02:34:55,690 --> 02:34:56,523
television channels.
There was these movies that he would 

3661
02:34:59,021 --> 02:35:01,990
come on and you know,
he would sing through the fucking movie.

3662
02:35:02,200 --> 02:35:03,033
There was only one elvis.
He was arguably one of the first ever 

3663
02:35:07,361 --> 02:35:10,780
singing movie stars.
Right?

3664
02:35:10,781 --> 02:35:12,940
Singing slash.
Superstars.

3665
02:35:13,330 --> 02:35:14,710
No,
he's still one of the first ones.

3666
02:35:14,740 --> 02:35:15,700
I mean,
how many of them there were,

3667
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:17,390
what are you shaking your head because 
you're wrong.

3668
02:35:17,950 --> 02:35:19,180
I mean,
just a great Kelly.

3669
02:35:19,181 --> 02:35:21,670
There's a few guys who around saying 
being crazy.

3670
02:35:21,790 --> 02:35:22,623
Right,
but how many of them were talking about 

3671
02:35:23,291 --> 02:35:24,124
Al Jolson?

3672
02:35:24,610 --> 02:35:25,050
Okay.

3673
02:35:25,050 --> 02:35:26,920
Al Jolson.
Al Jolson.

3674
02:35:26,980 --> 02:35:28,230
The first,
the first movie,

3675
02:35:28,560 --> 02:35:30,880
the first talkie talk.
He was in the first talkie.

3676
02:35:31,670 --> 02:35:32,460
I mean,
it's not,

3677
02:35:32,460 --> 02:35:34,470
it's officially known as the first 
target.

3678
02:35:34,471 --> 02:35:36,870
There was some sense it's called the 
jazz playing being point being,

3679
02:35:37,500 --> 02:35:39,380
there's not that many back then.
I mean,

3680
02:35:39,381 --> 02:35:42,330
it's a very small pool beings.
Yeah,

3681
02:35:42,480 --> 02:35:44,070
but Frank Sinatra didn't sing in movies.

3682
02:35:44,900 --> 02:35:45,460
Okay,

3683
02:35:45,460 --> 02:35:46,840
okay.
Joe Did he chai.

3684
02:35:46,841 --> 02:35:48,760
This is getting sad now.
Why Sang?

3685
02:35:48,761 --> 02:35:49,594
Did he say it was like that?
A part of the movies like Elvis would 

3686
02:35:51,330 --> 02:35:52,900
go,
we gotta go down to the beach.

3687
02:35:52,930 --> 02:35:56,450
We own it all down to the beach.
She on the town or any of the beach?

3688
02:35:56,730 --> 02:35:57,890
Kate's I like,
yes.

3689
02:35:58,700 --> 02:36:01,240
I mean he would sing,
but my point is,

3690
02:36:01,270 --> 02:36:02,103
even at oakey include Sinatra,
we're still only talking about like 20 

3691
02:36:05,381 --> 02:36:06,190
people.
Okay.

3692
02:36:06,190 --> 02:36:10,660
There's so few hundreds now.
I agree with you cause huge star.

3693
02:36:11,050 --> 02:36:12,160
My point is,
yeah,

3694
02:36:12,250 --> 02:36:14,320
it was a new thing.
It wasn't,

3695
02:36:14,350 --> 02:36:17,000
it wasn't,
it wasn't that it was,

3696
02:36:17,230 --> 02:36:19,210
it was not much history to it.
I mean,

3697
02:36:19,240 --> 02:36:20,073
television had only been around for a 
few decades when in the 1950s I mean 

3698
02:36:24,521 --> 02:36:27,610
it's super new.
And then movies before that,

3699
02:36:27,850 --> 02:36:28,540
you know,
we,

3700
02:36:28,540 --> 02:36:29,373
before you know,
the silent movies and then you're only 

3701
02:36:31,601 --> 02:36:33,970
talking about like a hundred years 
maximum,

3702
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:34,600
right?

3703
02:36:34,600 --> 02:36:35,433
So this is all a completely new 
experience that these girls are seeing 

3704
02:36:38,381 --> 02:36:40,720
this superstar,
this guy,

3705
02:36:40,721 --> 02:36:44,860
this Elvis Presley was perfect hair and 
his singing and his fucking jumpsuit and

3706
02:36:44,861 --> 02:36:47,080
the whole deal.
And the reaction to them,

3707
02:36:47,081 --> 02:36:47,914
it's almost like their brains can't 
process it and they're screaming and 

3708
02:36:52,241 --> 02:36:53,074
they're fainting and is one of the most 
bizarre things about watching elvis is 

3709
02:36:56,591 --> 02:37:00,340
watching the reaction to Elvis that 
these people have the audience.

3710
02:37:00,360 --> 02:37:01,360
Yeah,
no question.

3711
02:37:01,590 --> 02:37:02,740
Yeah.
Like that,

3712
02:37:02,741 --> 02:37:03,574
that power.
Can I talk about Elvis for another 

3713
02:37:05,291 --> 02:37:07,990
second?
You don't have to ask me if you can talk

3714
02:37:07,991 --> 02:37:08,320
about,
Oh,

3715
02:37:08,320 --> 02:37:10,330
I'm not allowed to just talk.
Just talk.

3716
02:37:10,331 --> 02:37:11,164
Yeah,
yeah,

3717
02:37:12,390 --> 02:37:13,120
yeah.

3718
02:37:13,120 --> 02:37:13,980
You know the book,

3719
02:37:16,340 --> 02:37:17,330
I'm silly.
I'm sorry.

3720
02:37:17,780 --> 02:37:20,000
She knows the book.
What is it?

3721
02:37:20,310 --> 02:37:22,850
It's,
it's written by the guy about 10,000

3722
02:37:22,851 --> 02:37:24,230
hours.
You need to do 10,000

3723
02:37:24,231 --> 02:37:26,630
hours to be good at something.
It was that Malcolm Gladwell.

3724
02:37:26,660 --> 02:37:28,370
Malcolm Gladwell.
Yeah.

3725
02:37:28,900 --> 02:37:31,130
And it's the one after blank.
Yeah.

3726
02:37:31,450 --> 02:37:32,560
Yeah.
Know that.

3727
02:37:32,820 --> 02:37:36,980
Right.
So Elvis is the opposite of the 10,000

3728
02:37:36,981 --> 02:37:39,680
hours.
The opposite.

3729
02:37:40,400 --> 02:37:42,160
Because if you go back and like,
it was like,

3730
02:37:42,230 --> 02:37:43,310
what was,
how did Elvis like,

3731
02:37:43,311 --> 02:37:44,510
whoa.
Was He sang in high school?

3732
02:37:44,511 --> 02:37:46,580
A little bit,
but not in a band.

3733
02:37:46,790 --> 02:37:51,050
Not in a band around Memphis,
Tennessee gigging or anything.

3734
02:37:51,350 --> 02:37:55,400
Recorded it thing for his mom.
A song for his mom at Sun Records said,

3735
02:37:55,401 --> 02:37:56,630
oh,
I want to sing here.

3736
02:37:57,170 --> 02:37:58,430
The girl,
the girl liked it,

3737
02:37:58,431 --> 02:37:59,300
you know,
the secretary,

3738
02:37:59,301 --> 02:38:01,190
she gave it to the boss.
He was like,

3739
02:38:01,191 --> 02:38:02,690
Oh,
I think you to getting the police.

3740
02:38:02,691 --> 02:38:03,524
Let me bring in some local guys and they
cut these unbelievable rockabilly 

3741
02:38:06,591 --> 02:38:07,130
albums.

3742
02:38:07,130 --> 02:38:09,740
He had never sung with the band.
Wow.

3743
02:38:09,850 --> 02:38:12,710
This thing around his home or anything,
who knows?

3744
02:38:12,711 --> 02:38:15,170
But even it wasn't 10,000
hours,

3745
02:38:15,171 --> 02:38:17,840
like the Beatles in Hamburg or something
like that where you're like,

3746
02:38:17,870 --> 02:38:18,703
oh,
I'm going to learn how to sing and get 

3747
02:38:19,671 --> 02:38:21,890
around it.
Or do you know billy Joel playing around

3748
02:38:21,891 --> 02:38:24,380
for a long time and then finally 
breaking through.

3749
02:38:24,410 --> 02:38:25,243
You know,
he was in a rock band of and became 

3750
02:38:26,871 --> 02:38:30,830
billy Joel and it's the craziest,
yeah,

3751
02:38:31,190 --> 02:38:34,430
I just feel like his story is like the,
he's the opposite of that 10,000

3752
02:38:34,431 --> 02:38:36,650
hour.
We should also at the gate.

3753
02:38:36,830 --> 02:38:37,540
Great.

3754
02:38:37,540 --> 02:38:38,373
And he was the biggest superstar ever.
Like there was no roadmap for him to 

3755
02:38:41,831 --> 02:38:43,990
follow.
There had never been anybody before him.

3756
02:38:44,170 --> 02:38:48,220
Plus he was also the first guy to 
experience pills.

3757
02:38:49,060 --> 02:38:50,260
Oh,
you know,

3758
02:38:50,261 --> 02:38:51,094
I mean the Fars like superstars,
like that's when the whole pill craze 

3759
02:38:53,591 --> 02:38:54,424
was coming on.
It was like during the 50s in the 60s 

3760
02:38:56,610 --> 02:38:57,400
you know,
there was that,

3761
02:38:57,400 --> 02:38:58,990
I mean,
how many fucking pills were there?

3762
02:38:58,991 --> 02:39:00,040
I mean,
there were opiates,

3763
02:39:00,041 --> 02:39:03,850
they could give you opium and you know,
milk of the poppy.

3764
02:39:04,120 --> 02:39:04,953
There was a bunch of different things 
that they would give people dilauded 

3765
02:39:07,361 --> 02:39:08,194
member that they used to give those a 
women dilauded and those old wild west 

3766
02:39:10,661 --> 02:39:11,550
movies,
that was it.

3767
02:39:11,551 --> 02:39:12,670
Basically,
uh,

3768
02:39:12,740 --> 02:39:16,330
an opiod.
They would give them certain drugs,

3769
02:39:16,331 --> 02:39:17,164
but

3770
02:39:17,660 --> 02:39:20,570
he was one of the first guys that really
got into like pills.

3771
02:39:21,230 --> 02:39:22,640
Yeah.
Yeah.

3772
02:39:22,641 --> 02:39:25,460
He had some,
he was kind of an addict,

3773
02:39:25,461 --> 02:39:26,151
right?
Oh fuck.

3774
02:39:26,151 --> 02:39:26,540
Yeah.
It was,

3775
02:39:26,540 --> 02:39:27,050
yeah.

3776
02:39:27,050 --> 02:39:27,411
Yeah.
I mean,

3777
02:39:27,411 --> 02:39:28,910
that's one of the reasons why he died so
young.

3778
02:39:29,120 --> 02:39:29,953
I mean,

3779
02:39:29,970 --> 02:39:31,860
for sure.
Yeah.

3780
02:39:31,861 --> 02:39:33,270
I never saw,
I never saw him perform,

3781
02:39:33,271 --> 02:39:35,530
but I did see,
I know you were talking about,

3782
02:39:35,540 --> 02:39:36,750
uh,
Freddie Mercury.

3783
02:39:36,780 --> 02:39:37,800
I saw those guys,
Huh?

3784
02:39:37,830 --> 02:39:39,060
Yeah.
And you'd liked him,

3785
02:39:39,061 --> 02:39:39,841
right?
Oh fuck.

3786
02:39:39,841 --> 02:39:43,270
Yeah.
Huge Freddie Mercury fan do.

3787
02:39:43,680 --> 02:39:44,511
Right.
I went to,

3788
02:39:44,511 --> 02:39:47,340
I've only saw him in concert once and 
I'm still laughing at it.

3789
02:39:47,610 --> 02:39:48,510
Really?
Oh,

3790
02:39:48,690 --> 02:39:50,640
they do the most ridiculous thing in 
concert.

3791
02:39:50,790 --> 02:39:51,750
First of all,
he started getting,

3792
02:39:51,751 --> 02:39:53,360
oh,
he's in a white suit and then by the end

3793
02:39:53,361 --> 02:39:55,680
he just didn't like white underwear.
You know,

3794
02:39:55,681 --> 02:39:56,514
he's just great.
He was like a slowly shoes are off the 

3795
02:39:58,531 --> 02:39:59,460
shirts off.
It's great.

3796
02:39:59,490 --> 02:40:02,550
It's great.
But you know the Song Bohemian rhapsody?

3797
02:40:02,551 --> 02:40:04,680
Yeah.
Do you know how they do it in concert?

3798
02:40:04,710 --> 02:40:05,810
No.
Oh,

3799
02:40:06,310 --> 02:40:08,370
it's classic.
So I'm like,

3800
02:40:08,640 --> 02:40:09,473
okay,
I can't wait to see this Bahamian 

3801
02:40:10,411 --> 02:40:13,050
rhapsody like are they going to go 
around a Mike,

3802
02:40:13,170 --> 02:40:14,850
hold their aunt or their ears and do 
the,

3803
02:40:14,880 --> 02:40:16,520
is this the,
you know the harmonies?

3804
02:40:17,070 --> 02:40:18,750
None of it.
They skip the beginning part.

3805
02:40:18,900 --> 02:40:20,670
The skip it.
Skip it completely.

3806
02:40:20,671 --> 02:40:23,910
Start with a doon.
Doon Doon Doon Doon doon the piano part.

3807
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:24,900
Real Mama.
Yeah.

3808
02:40:24,901 --> 02:40:27,090
They don't do the,
is this the reela is,

3809
02:40:27,091 --> 02:40:29,240
it's just fantasy.
Call it in Atlanta.

3810
02:40:29,450 --> 02:40:32,460
All in escape.
All of that gone.

3811
02:40:32,790 --> 02:40:33,623
Really?
Yeah.

3812
02:40:33,990 --> 02:40:36,000
So they start with the song,
wait Joe,

3813
02:40:36,001 --> 02:40:37,830
this gets better.
Yeah.

3814
02:40:37,831 --> 02:40:39,300
They smiling.
I just killed a man.

3815
02:40:39,570 --> 02:40:40,690
People are going,
Nah.

3816
02:40:41,280 --> 02:40:45,630
Then they played the first guitar solo 
and then they got dunked in den.

3817
02:40:46,170 --> 02:40:47,430
I'm just,
you know that part,

3818
02:40:47,431 --> 02:40:50,100
the opera part,
guess what happens at that part?

3819
02:40:50,130 --> 02:40:54,150
What they run offstage?
Queen leaves the stage.

3820
02:40:54,151 --> 02:40:54,984
They play the record.
I'm just at the end and then the whole 

3821
02:40:56,911 --> 02:41:01,911
opera park figure [inaudible] I'm just 
up a boy if I'm up over all of that.

3822
02:41:04,260 --> 02:41:07,800
And then when they come back for the 
guitar so damned and an end,

3823
02:41:07,801 --> 02:41:10,860
they don't learn and then they come back
on stage and sing the rest of the show.

3824
02:41:11,220 --> 02:41:12,390
The song.
Huh?

3825
02:41:12,630 --> 02:41:15,750
It's the craziest thing I'd ever seen 
Madison Square.

3826
02:41:15,751 --> 02:41:17,640
I'm like,
I turn to the person that I was like,

3827
02:41:18,180 --> 02:41:20,370
you realize there's no one on stage 
right now?

3828
02:41:21,270 --> 02:41:22,103
No one on stage.
And they're just playing that opera 

3829
02:41:23,821 --> 02:41:24,770
part.
Hmm.

3830
02:41:25,200 --> 02:41:27,180
Like a song of it.
Wonder why they do that.

3831
02:41:27,720 --> 02:41:28,553
Cause it vocally,
I assume we would just be impossible to 

3832
02:41:31,140 --> 02:41:33,990
come near what's on that record,
right?

3833
02:41:34,140 --> 02:41:35,100
Yeah.
Gas.

3834
02:41:35,860 --> 02:41:36,840
You liked that song,
right?

3835
02:41:36,870 --> 02:41:37,703
Yeah.
But I would imagine they would want to 

3836
02:41:38,790 --> 02:41:39,623
replicate,
I mean opera singers can replicate 

3837
02:41:41,101 --> 02:41:42,390
opera.
Yeah.

3838
02:41:42,391 --> 02:41:44,710
But it's so multitrack.
Right,

3839
02:41:44,920 --> 02:41:45,760
right.
Yeah.

3840
02:41:45,810 --> 02:41:48,970
That's did it in it.
Yeah.

3841
02:41:49,020 --> 02:41:51,450
I will not.
But you,

3842
02:41:51,530 --> 02:41:55,440
which you would think that they would 
like at least perform part of it.

3843
02:41:57,120 --> 02:41:59,490
What they do,
they do the the easy.

3844
02:41:59,520 --> 02:42:00,353
Know what I mean?
While they're doing it while all the 

3845
02:42:01,810 --> 02:42:05,910
hallways at least participate.
Run offstage.

3846
02:42:06,020 --> 02:42:06,853
Huh?
Maybe like a cigarette break for little 

3847
02:42:08,311 --> 02:42:09,180
girls.
It's just like,

3848
02:42:09,181 --> 02:42:11,490
we can't do this.
We're out of here.

3849
02:42:11,880 --> 02:42:14,190
And then they come back and he was 
pretty good singer.

3850
02:42:14,480 --> 02:42:16,140
Yeah.
That guy was a good singer.

3851
02:42:16,450 --> 02:42:17,890
Hmm.
Um,

3852
02:42:17,950 --> 02:42:21,120
what's the best counselor you've seen or
your favorite favorite.

3853
02:42:21,480 --> 02:42:23,470
Do you leave and go to concerts?
No,

3854
02:42:23,471 --> 02:42:26,370
very rarely now cause I can,
all right.

3855
02:42:26,371 --> 02:42:27,690
This is going to sound insulting.

3856
02:42:30,200 --> 02:42:32,070
It's going to send him.
So I said okay.

3857
02:42:32,490 --> 02:42:35,160
But I,
when I look at,

3858
02:42:35,161 --> 02:42:36,780
you know,
your act,

3859
02:42:36,810 --> 02:42:39,450
I think if you like it,
a slayer concert.

3860
02:42:39,840 --> 02:42:40,673
Oh,
that's hilarious.

3861
02:42:40,680 --> 02:42:42,600
A Danzig counseling,
any of that shit.

3862
02:42:42,630 --> 02:42:44,090
You don't know?
No.

3863
02:42:44,550 --> 02:42:46,080
Tell me what you like.
Ah,

3864
02:42:46,081 --> 02:42:48,390
I'm totally,
I apologize if I judged you on,

3865
02:42:48,580 --> 02:42:53,490
you're kind of an aggressive act right 
now.

3866
02:42:53,491 --> 02:42:57,240
I'm like a slayer aggressive act.
You don't even watch,

3867
02:42:57,780 --> 02:42:58,860
he doesn't watch the,
Oh,

3868
02:42:58,880 --> 02:43:00,660
I would like to do it the other night.
Doing your,

3869
02:43:00,670 --> 02:43:04,050
uh,
a bit about Bruce,

3870
02:43:04,080 --> 02:43:06,480
the new Bruce Jenner or whatever.
What's her name?

3871
02:43:06,481 --> 02:43:07,470
Caitlyn.
Caitlyn Jenner.

3872
02:43:07,471 --> 02:43:08,304
Yeah.
How do you feel about that Caitlyn 

3873
02:43:09,300 --> 02:43:10,260
Jenner thing?
Wow.

3874
02:43:10,990 --> 02:43:12,160
First of all,
I'm afraid

3875
02:43:12,160 --> 02:43:14,520
to talk about it cause I'm going to get 
frick to tug.

3876
02:43:14,521 --> 02:43:16,860
You're way braver than I am.
Way Braver.

3877
02:43:16,861 --> 02:43:17,694
And I,
although there was a comedian last 

3878
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:20,530
night,
I had a great joke.

3879
02:43:21,340 --> 02:43:22,180
God,
what was his name?

3880
02:43:23,080 --> 02:43:25,660
Kyle.
Kyle Kinane.

3881
02:43:25,720 --> 02:43:26,501
No,
not kyle.

3882
02:43:26,501 --> 02:43:27,334
Kinane.
Um,

3883
02:43:27,340 --> 02:43:29,190
I'll think of his name.
It,

3884
02:43:29,200 --> 02:43:31,540
this is not my dog,
but he said he don't say his joke.

3885
02:43:31,600 --> 02:43:33,520
Don't say your joke without his name.
No,

3886
02:43:33,580 --> 02:43:36,950
they're going to give his joke or it was
just a throw away.

3887
02:43:37,160 --> 02:43:40,710
Don't say don't say anything ever.
Uh,

3888
02:43:41,050 --> 02:43:43,750
he's doing now.
He's doing the tonight show on Wednesday

3889
02:43:43,751 --> 02:43:46,180
and he's not doing that joke.
He told a joke before.

3890
02:43:46,181 --> 02:43:48,280
He does it on this and I just not doing 
it on the tonight.

3891
02:43:48,281 --> 02:43:49,780
Show what I'm saying it all right.
Nevermind.

3892
02:43:49,810 --> 02:43:50,830
Nevermind.
Nevermind.

3893
02:43:51,170 --> 02:43:52,003
Uh,
but it's a weird subject right where it 

3894
02:43:53,101 --> 02:43:53,934
is all the sudden you're not supposed to
make fun of something that's obviously 

3895
02:43:56,051 --> 02:43:58,780
ridiculous,
unprecedented,

3896
02:43:58,840 --> 02:43:59,673
unprecedented.

3897
02:44:00,070 --> 02:44:03,010
I don't buy it and I'm not going to buy 
it and I don't care.

3898
02:44:03,150 --> 02:44:05,290
I just get any blow back at all.
You do?

3899
02:44:05,410 --> 02:44:06,340
Sure.
People get upset.

3900
02:44:06,370 --> 02:44:08,260
Yeah.
And do zen out on it.

3901
02:44:08,290 --> 02:44:10,570
Do you think it's funny?
I listen,

3902
02:44:10,930 --> 02:44:13,990
were we,
this is a really easily defensible one.

3903
02:44:14,320 --> 02:44:15,153
First of all,
you're talking about a ridiculous human 

3904
02:44:16,271 --> 02:44:17,110
being.
Okay.

3905
02:44:17,150 --> 02:44:19,330
Not just ridiculous,
but patently ridiculous.

3906
02:44:19,390 --> 02:44:20,223
Right?
A guy who is a transsexual jeff dye was 

3907
02:44:22,571 --> 02:44:23,351
the comedian.
Oh,

3908
02:44:23,351 --> 02:44:24,910
okay.
I'm going to do each joke later.

3909
02:44:24,911 --> 02:44:25,744
Transsexual comedian who comedian 
transsexual man became a woman and 

3910
02:44:30,851 --> 02:44:33,910
doesn't believe in gay marriage.
So he's ridiculous person right there.

3911
02:44:34,240 --> 02:44:36,370
And when on Ellen,
when Ellen confronted him,

3912
02:44:36,371 --> 02:44:37,450
did you ever watch that?
No.

3913
02:44:37,510 --> 02:44:39,610
It's pretty fucking awkward because you 
realize,

3914
02:44:39,611 --> 02:44:41,200
first of all,
how stupid he really is.

3915
02:44:41,230 --> 02:44:44,320
He's a dumb man.
He's not smart as a woman,

3916
02:44:44,321 --> 02:44:45,580
as a man,
whatever.

3917
02:44:45,580 --> 02:44:49,930
But when Ellen's talk knew about gay 
rights and about gay marriage about,

3918
02:44:50,140 --> 02:44:53,500
wouldn't you think that you as a person 
who's been marginalized your whole life,

3919
02:44:53,501 --> 02:44:54,334
you would support his argument was or 
her argument whenever you want to call 

3920
02:44:57,010 --> 02:45:00,310
while voice from tron for short of a 
traditionalist like no,

3921
02:45:00,311 --> 02:45:02,770
you're not a traditional,
you're a fucking man with nail Polish on

3922
02:45:02,771 --> 02:45:07,150
and address who's now a woman and you 
had your jaw shave down to be a woman.

3923
02:45:07,151 --> 02:45:10,480
You have fake tits,
you're not fucking traditional at all.

3924
02:45:10,540 --> 02:45:14,290
And that's a shitty,
stupid excuse for being a bigot.

3925
02:45:14,710 --> 02:45:15,543
Like you can't say that you don't 
support gay marriage because you're a 

3926
02:45:18,191 --> 02:45:21,040
traditional woman cause you're not a 
traditional woman.

3927
02:45:21,430 --> 02:45:22,263
All right.
And then I know it says a bunch of 

3928
02:45:23,831 --> 02:45:27,580
things about him.
He doesn't hold that position.

3929
02:45:27,610 --> 02:45:32,230
You feel gives you more latitude.
It drives me nuts.

3930
02:45:32,580 --> 02:45:33,413
The only thing that we're supposed to be
paying attention to when you're looking 

3931
02:45:35,801 --> 02:45:38,290
at someone who's doing something that's 
obviously odd,

3932
02:45:38,680 --> 02:45:39,331
right?
Right.

3933
02:45:39,331 --> 02:45:41,770
You're not supposed to make fun of it 
because it's a thing about gender.

3934
02:45:41,950 --> 02:45:45,170
Why is gender all of a sudden the only 
that,

3935
02:45:45,180 --> 02:45:49,060
like this is the only category that 
precludes you from humor.

3936
02:45:49,510 --> 02:45:51,400
Like you're,
you're supposed to be,

3937
02:45:51,490 --> 02:45:53,230
you're,
you're unsafe space,

3938
02:45:53,290 --> 02:45:53,801
right?
You've,

3939
02:45:53,801 --> 02:45:54,634
you've,
you've,

3940
02:45:54,670 --> 02:45:56,980
you're holding on to base.
Like I'm touching base.

3941
02:45:56,981 --> 02:45:58,690
You can't get me,
I'm touching base.

3942
02:45:58,840 --> 02:45:59,673
This is gender that I reject that.
And I think that over time we're going 

3943
02:46:03,751 --> 02:46:04,584
to realize how ridiculous we were acting
with this preposterous person who's 

3944
02:46:07,811 --> 02:46:10,070
essentially a male cardiac,
an

3945
02:46:10,100 --> 02:46:12,290
older male card.
I mean that's what the fuck he is.

3946
02:46:12,320 --> 02:46:13,153
No.
Right.

3947
02:46:13,280 --> 02:46:15,590
And on top of that,
everybody forgets.

3948
02:46:15,591 --> 02:46:16,424
He killed a woman.
He fucking slammed into some lady cause 

3949
02:46:18,261 --> 02:46:19,094
he wasn't paying attention,
knocked her into oncoming traffic and 

3950
02:46:20,961 --> 02:46:21,794
she died.
And everybody's just sort of whisked 

3951
02:46:23,481 --> 02:46:24,314
that away.
And then he wins an Sba award and he's 

3952
02:46:26,390 --> 02:46:27,223
walking around with fucking drapes 
flowing the curtains and the breeze and 

3953
02:46:31,161 --> 02:46:31,994
there's a helicopter flying over.
And when he's walking around his house 

3954
02:46:34,161 --> 02:46:36,320
and his heels,
it's preposterous.

3955
02:46:36,440 --> 02:46:37,273
This is a preposterous person.
This is not his standard subject of 

3956
02:46:42,231 --> 02:46:44,300
transsexuals who,
you know,

3957
02:46:44,301 --> 02:46:45,134
need to be respected for the choices.
Of course you should respect people for 

3958
02:46:47,691 --> 02:46:49,010
their choices.
Of course,

3959
02:46:49,011 --> 02:46:52,460
people should be able to express 
themselves in any way they want.

3960
02:46:52,461 --> 02:46:56,810
You could be a heterosexual man who is 
completely into women but likes dressing

3961
02:46:56,811 --> 02:46:58,700
up like a woman and I support that too.

3962
02:46:59,030 --> 02:46:59,863
You can say you're a woman.
He was a woman when he was on the Diane 

3963
02:47:02,180 --> 02:47:05,030
Sawyer show or he was a man.
He said he wants to be him.

3964
02:47:05,270 --> 02:47:08,870
He wants to be called [inaudible].
And then immediately after the attention

3965
02:47:08,871 --> 02:47:09,704
that he got from that,
he gets massive surgery and changes his 

3966
02:47:11,571 --> 02:47:15,230
name to Caitlyn.
This is a ridiculous person,

3967
02:47:15,800 --> 02:47:16,633
right?
This is a person that's infatuated with 

3968
02:47:18,770 --> 02:47:23,150
attention for no reason,
not attention for their art,

3969
02:47:23,151 --> 02:47:27,500
not attention for their philosophies or 
for their thoughts or for their work.

3970
02:47:27,740 --> 02:47:30,200
No,
this is a person who's a infatuated with

3971
02:47:30,210 --> 02:47:35,090
attention for no reason.
That's why I think you're supposed to be

3972
02:47:35,091 --> 02:47:36,140
able to make fun of this person.

3973
02:47:36,480 --> 02:47:41,160
I think my feeling is that,
and again,

3974
02:47:41,161 --> 02:47:43,950
I am,
you know my act not edgy at all.

3975
02:47:44,130 --> 02:47:44,970
Dot.
Not Edge.

3976
02:47:44,971 --> 02:47:46,200
React.
Well

3977
02:47:46,460 --> 02:47:48,740
you,
you go after some stuff.

3978
02:47:48,800 --> 02:47:49,633
I loved your bit about actors.
I fucking love that because I've always 

3979
02:47:53,301 --> 02:47:54,134
felt the same way.
You did a bit that I was clapping and 

3980
02:47:56,331 --> 02:48:00,920
laughing out about actors being able to 
cry on cue and you were like,

3981
02:48:00,921 --> 02:48:03,800
yeah,
that's because they're fucking crazy.

3982
02:48:04,340 --> 02:48:09,290
Like these are massively damaged people.
Like trust me,

3983
02:48:09,291 --> 02:48:10,790
I know them.
I work with them.

3984
02:48:10,791 --> 02:48:11,960
You did this really cool.

3985
02:48:13,130 --> 02:48:14,010
Thank you.
Thank you.

3986
02:48:14,240 --> 02:48:14,981
Right.
All right.

3987
02:48:14,981 --> 02:48:17,150
But that's his,
that's his like his head.

3988
02:48:17,330 --> 02:48:19,430
Yes,
but you went in the,

3989
02:48:19,431 --> 02:48:20,264
I did.
I knew when all it does is completely 

3990
02:48:22,511 --> 02:48:23,344
benign,
but you have to work with them all the 

3991
02:48:24,251 --> 02:48:25,240
time.
I know,

3992
02:48:25,241 --> 02:48:25,900
I know.
I know.

3993
02:48:25,900 --> 02:48:28,180
I know what it was just about because I 
went to acting school,

3994
02:48:28,210 --> 02:48:28,940
right?
Yeah,

3995
02:48:28,940 --> 02:48:29,773
yeah.
And patently the most ridiculous people 

3996
02:48:32,801 --> 02:48:35,260
and all of show business.
The actor without a doubt.

3997
02:48:35,530 --> 02:48:36,010
Yeah.
We're here.

3998
02:48:36,010 --> 02:48:36,830
Well,
I want,

3999
02:48:36,830 --> 02:48:38,890
hey,
Seinfeld does a great,

4000
02:48:39,130 --> 02:48:41,440
just a great takedown actors all the 
time.

4001
02:48:41,441 --> 02:48:43,330
He says like,
what are they?

4002
02:48:43,480 --> 02:48:45,730
Why are we giving them awards?
I was like,

4003
02:48:45,880 --> 02:48:48,290
they're told what to say,
where to stand,

4004
02:48:48,310 --> 02:48:52,330
but they don't have to do Anik,
why are they getting an award?

4005
02:48:52,720 --> 02:48:53,680
It's great.
It's great.

4006
02:48:53,700 --> 02:48:55,060
Um,
yeah,

4007
02:48:55,061 --> 02:48:56,470
no,
I learned that in acting school.

4008
02:48:56,471 --> 02:48:58,870
Then it'll be like the more emotional 
leeward,

4009
02:48:59,120 --> 02:49:01,450
the better actor you were like it's 
true.

4010
02:49:01,530 --> 02:49:02,260
Yeah,
it's true.

4011
02:49:02,260 --> 02:49:05,380
The more emotionally imbalanced,
the more the whole thing,

4012
02:49:05,500 --> 02:49:06,333
the less grounded you are in reality.
You're creating this whole thing that 

4013
02:49:09,270 --> 02:49:11,380
you can really become a great actor.
Um,

4014
02:49:12,630 --> 02:49:16,880
I knew that my point was it,
even if Katelyn wasn't all of it,

4015
02:49:16,910 --> 02:49:21,750
even if she was pro gay marriage or not 
part of the Kardashians,

4016
02:49:21,990 --> 02:49:25,380
I still feel like it's part of life and 
can be made fun of.

4017
02:49:25,470 --> 02:49:26,750
Sure.
I don't,

4018
02:49:27,120 --> 02:49:27,953
this is a thing I have a problem with 
and which is this thing about punching 

4019
02:49:32,491 --> 02:49:33,324
down.
Do you have any idea what I'm talking 

4020
02:49:34,111 --> 02:49:34,470
about?
Yeah.

4021
02:49:34,470 --> 02:49:39,180
But this is all nonsense.
It's all nonsense to make fun of things.

4022
02:49:39,181 --> 02:49:40,350
You're allowed to make fun of 
everything.

4023
02:49:40,380 --> 02:49:43,710
More fun of myself as my main thing,
but like you're letting me find,

4024
02:49:43,711 --> 02:49:46,310
I think it's great.
Of course that's a Gibson,

4025
02:49:47,130 --> 02:49:49,590
this hole punching down thing is a 
symptom.

4026
02:49:49,620 --> 02:49:50,453
It's all coming out of social media.
It's a consequence of people being able 

4027
02:49:52,741 --> 02:49:53,574
to criticize and get upset about things 
and become recreationally outraged and 

4028
02:49:57,871 --> 02:49:59,370
yeah.
Well there's some punching down.

4029
02:49:59,371 --> 02:50:00,204
It's really fucking mean of course.
But then there's Kennison talking about 

4030
02:50:03,391 --> 02:50:06,300
the starving people in Ethiopia.
That's fucking hilarious.

4031
02:50:06,460 --> 02:50:07,293
It's a total punching down bit and it's 
one of the greatest bits of all time 

4032
02:50:10,170 --> 02:50:11,003
you,
but it's funny and you cannot define 

4033
02:50:12,570 --> 02:50:15,210
what's funny and what's not funny.
Some people,

4034
02:50:16,040 --> 02:50:20,540
well we have seen some mean common who 
bully be able with their comedy.

4035
02:50:20,541 --> 02:50:21,380
Right.
Doesn't work though.

4036
02:50:21,480 --> 02:50:21,980
Right,
right.

4037
02:50:21,980 --> 02:50:23,420
It's not good.
Nobody likes it.

4038
02:50:23,810 --> 02:50:25,010
I know.
I've seen it.

4039
02:50:25,070 --> 02:50:26,630
I've seen it work sometimes.
So it's,

4040
02:50:27,140 --> 02:50:27,973
I'm not saying there's nothing to it.
I'm saying the idea that like some 

4041
02:50:31,791 --> 02:50:32,624
things are off limits or what did your 
great analogy years and of I'm on base 

4042
02:50:36,561 --> 02:50:38,930
and this,
you can't touch this crazy,

4043
02:50:38,931 --> 02:50:40,380
right?
It's nothing off limits but,

4044
02:50:41,180 --> 02:50:43,700
but people will decide that there's 
something off limits.

4045
02:50:43,701 --> 02:50:47,450
And then the way they reinforce that 
they gang up on people like bullies.

4046
02:50:48,050 --> 02:50:48,883
Like Daniel Tosh got in trouble.
Remember when Daniel Tosh made that 

4047
02:50:51,771 --> 02:50:53,220
joke,
which was a,

4048
02:50:53,270 --> 02:50:55,130
uh,
we're dealing with the handler,

4049
02:50:55,131 --> 02:50:55,964
right?
He's dealing with a heckler and 

4050
02:50:56,990 --> 02:50:59,750
[inaudible] he was also not even 
supposed to be on stage,

4051
02:50:59,780 --> 02:51:00,613
so he didn't have any material prepared.
And Dom irrera forced him to go on 

4052
02:51:03,641 --> 02:51:04,940
stage.
The client go on stage.

4053
02:51:04,941 --> 02:51:05,840
So he,
he said,

4054
02:51:05,841 --> 02:51:06,500
all right,
okay.

4055
02:51:06,500 --> 02:51:07,333
So we went on stage and he didn't have 
any materials cause what do you guys 

4056
02:51:08,721 --> 02:51:09,770
want to talk?
I don't have any material.

4057
02:51:09,771 --> 02:51:12,560
What do you guys want to talk about?
And some guy yells out rape.

4058
02:51:13,430 --> 02:51:14,510
And so he goes,
well,

4059
02:51:14,840 --> 02:51:16,640
what's funny about rape?
The humiliation,

4060
02:51:16,641 --> 02:51:18,170
the violence.
Like what's sorry,

4061
02:51:18,171 --> 02:51:19,130
what's funny about rape,
right?

4062
02:51:19,250 --> 02:51:22,430
And some woman yells at,
actually nothing's funny about rape.

4063
02:51:22,700 --> 02:51:23,533
This is like someone who took the 
opportunity to be sanctimonious and 

4064
02:51:27,890 --> 02:51:29,360
obviously nothing's funny.
Rape.

4065
02:51:29,390 --> 02:51:30,223
And he goes,
well wouldn't it be funny if five guys 

4066
02:51:30,891 --> 02:51:34,400
just raped her right now?
Which is something that a comedian would

4067
02:51:34,401 --> 02:51:35,240
say,
right?

4068
02:51:35,270 --> 02:51:39,710
And so this woman goes and writes a blog
and then it becomes this big issue.

4069
02:51:39,711 --> 02:51:42,830
Did he crossed the line?
She's a fucking heckler.

4070
02:51:42,890 --> 02:51:44,990
I know he's a heckler.
Not only that,

4071
02:51:44,991 --> 02:51:45,824
she's the worst kind of hackler.
Someone is trying to take the high 

4072
02:51:49,221 --> 02:51:50,054
ground and you know,
and be sanctimonious and stand up and 

4073
02:51:53,661 --> 02:51:56,510
admonish anyone for saying like,
look,

4074
02:51:56,511 --> 02:51:58,400
you'll enjoy the show or don't enjoy the
show.

4075
02:51:58,550 --> 02:52:00,500
Leave,
do whatever the fuck you want.

4076
02:52:00,501 --> 02:52:01,334
But if you want to jump in and decide 
that you're going to be the moral voice 

4077
02:52:05,500 --> 02:52:07,570
of the crowd,
you're going to get chopped up.

4078
02:52:07,780 --> 02:52:09,340
And that's how comedy works.
That's your,

4079
02:52:09,341 --> 02:52:10,174
you're dealing with live comedy.
And when someone has to make comedy out 

4080
02:52:13,151 --> 02:52:13,984
of what you just,
you just come all over these people and 

4081
02:52:17,470 --> 02:52:21,910
you used your emotions and you used your
morality and you decided you're going to

4082
02:52:21,911 --> 02:52:24,640
enforce it on these people in the middle
of a comedy show,

4083
02:52:24,940 --> 02:52:27,280
you can't do that.
You know what he's doing?

4084
02:52:27,370 --> 02:52:29,470
He's trying to make comedy out of 
something.

4085
02:52:29,520 --> 02:52:32,460
And also just his reaction to be the,
yeah,

4086
02:52:32,461 --> 02:52:34,200
it was perfect.
Just do that kind of like,

4087
02:52:34,201 --> 02:52:36,330
okay,
what is the worst offensive thing

4088
02:52:36,560 --> 02:52:39,820
say to somebody who just said nothing 
about rapes fun.

4089
02:52:39,890 --> 02:52:41,650
Yeah.
Would it be funny if five guys raped her

4090
02:52:41,651 --> 02:52:42,780
right now and then,
hey,

4091
02:52:43,010 --> 02:52:44,090
by the way,
the audience,

4092
02:52:44,290 --> 02:52:45,610
how old laughing,
right?

4093
02:52:45,680 --> 02:52:46,513
Timing was perfect and she's decided 
this is a fucking wonderful opportunity 

4094
02:52:50,271 --> 02:52:51,950
to be recreationally outraged.

4095
02:52:53,310 --> 02:52:54,143
Yeah.
It's,

4096
02:52:54,150 --> 02:52:57,570
look,
I hate fuck them.

4097
02:52:57,630 --> 02:52:58,830
I understand.
I understand,

4098
02:52:59,280 --> 02:53:00,670
but I do.
What about,

4099
02:53:00,830 --> 02:53:03,540
let me,
let me take the side of like,

4100
02:53:04,200 --> 02:53:05,033
look,
now that I have a twitter account and 

4101
02:53:07,760 --> 02:53:09,600
I'm not talking about me,
I'm talking about in our audience member

4102
02:53:09,601 --> 02:53:10,434
now,
who was outraged that somebody made fun 

4103
02:53:12,121 --> 02:53:15,360
of something that now comedians can't 
hear.

4104
02:53:15,361 --> 02:53:16,194
Like I don't have free speech.
I can't yell at me and my friends can 

4105
02:53:19,591 --> 02:53:21,930
gang up on a comedian yell at them on 
twitter.

4106
02:53:22,320 --> 02:53:23,550
You certainly again.
Right,

4107
02:53:25,080 --> 02:53:26,340
but you're a cunt.
Oh,

4108
02:53:26,620 --> 02:53:27,453
okay.

4109
02:53:28,350 --> 02:53:29,183
Well it depends.
It depends on whether or not you have a 

4110
02:53:30,621 --> 02:53:31,454
point,
right.

4111
02:53:31,670 --> 02:53:34,940
It's like all kinds of opinions and you 
can have an argument with someone,

4112
02:53:34,941 --> 02:53:37,410
like say if you have an argument,
someone publicly and somebody stands and

4113
02:53:37,420 --> 02:53:38,253
walks by and they maybe didn't get the 
entire full argument but they watch you 

4114
02:53:40,761 --> 02:53:41,594
say something mean to that person.
They're allowed to have an opinion on 

4115
02:53:44,001 --> 02:53:44,834
that.
It might not be the most informed 

4116
02:53:45,801 --> 02:53:47,180
opinion,
it might not be correct.

4117
02:53:47,181 --> 02:53:51,140
And then maybe you can choose to engage 
them and have a discussion about their,

4118
02:53:51,200 --> 02:53:53,410
their opinion or you can choose to not 
and let it,

4119
02:53:53,450 --> 02:53:57,140
let it exist in a vacuum and let them 
just fucking Yap about it.

4120
02:53:57,140 --> 02:53:58,310
Yeah.
Let me ask you another question.

4121
02:53:58,370 --> 02:53:59,203
Okay.
And I know you don't like it ha like me 

4122
02:54:00,771 --> 02:54:03,290
asking about asking questions.
Right.

4123
02:54:04,100 --> 02:54:06,290
That's not the question though.
Okay.

4124
02:54:06,980 --> 02:54:07,813
That's not the question.
Is there anything you've done in your 

4125
02:54:11,511 --> 02:54:15,590
act through the years and you've 
released many albums,

4126
02:54:15,630 --> 02:54:17,330
had five specials,
right?

4127
02:54:17,870 --> 02:54:18,590
At least.
Yeah.

4128
02:54:18,590 --> 02:54:21,560
At least candy we count.
Uh,

4129
02:54:22,190 --> 02:54:24,410
is there anything you've looked back and
gone?

4130
02:54:24,810 --> 02:54:27,920
I don't think I would have worded that 
today the way I did back then.

4131
02:54:29,100 --> 02:54:29,933
Not In terms of it being offensive,
but in terms of it being solid man on 

4132
02:54:33,750 --> 02:54:34,583
the economy of words was incorrect or it
wasn't the best bit or I should have 

4133
02:54:38,701 --> 02:54:43,270
worked on it more before I did it.
Or maybe I got a little lazy and my,

4134
02:54:43,430 --> 02:54:45,510
which is more about tightening,
making a bit better.

4135
02:54:45,511 --> 02:54:49,800
Yeah.
But that's just like looking at it now,

4136
02:54:49,860 --> 02:54:53,370
standing back and being completely done 
with the material and then going over it

4137
02:54:53,371 --> 02:54:55,800
now and then being able to critique it 
honestly and openly.

4138
02:54:56,370 --> 02:54:58,890
But at the time,
no is my points.

4139
02:54:59,650 --> 02:55:01,180
I'm,
I'm saying looking back,

4140
02:55:01,750 --> 02:55:02,950
would you go,
ah,

4141
02:55:03,080 --> 02:55:04,250
I wish I hadn't said

4142
02:55:06,610 --> 02:55:07,490
no,
not really.

4143
02:55:07,580 --> 02:55:08,360
No.
I think that's,

4144
02:55:08,360 --> 02:55:09,590
no,
no,

4145
02:55:09,591 --> 02:55:12,710
I mean I think pretty much everything 
I've ever said I've thought about before

4146
02:55:12,711 --> 02:55:13,544
I said it enough to point where I had to
have a reason for wanting to joke about 

4147
02:55:16,671 --> 02:55:19,130
it and then I had to have a,
a perspective,

4148
02:55:20,180 --> 02:55:23,230
I'm betting matches more as a evolution 
is someone who's always,

4149
02:55:24,110 --> 02:55:25,700
as you said earlier,
learning,

4150
02:55:25,820 --> 02:55:26,720
trying new things.

4151
02:55:26,940 --> 02:55:28,400
Yeah.
I mean here was,

4152
02:55:28,440 --> 02:55:31,260
have an evolution of my own thought 
process.

4153
02:55:31,380 --> 02:55:33,930
Right.
But I think when I look at old comedy,

4154
02:55:33,931 --> 02:55:37,650
what gets me is how it links to what 
words.

4155
02:55:37,710 --> 02:55:39,510
Yeah.
An extra words.

4156
02:55:40,290 --> 02:55:43,770
Economy of words.
So critical and also,

4157
02:55:43,800 --> 02:55:44,633
you know,
the being in the moment and the timing 

4158
02:55:46,621 --> 02:55:47,700
and you know,
and just,

4159
02:55:47,970 --> 02:55:50,220
it's why it's hard to watch yourself.
It's hard,

4160
02:55:50,520 --> 02:55:54,090
but it's critical because that,
that watching and listening to yourself,

4161
02:55:54,091 --> 02:55:56,130
do you tape yourself?
Reset every set.

4162
02:55:56,460 --> 02:55:57,330
Wow.
Yeah.

4163
02:55:57,840 --> 02:55:59,690
That is discipline.
Got It.

4164
02:55:59,730 --> 02:56:00,750
That is hot.
Yeah.

4165
02:56:00,751 --> 02:56:01,584
That the only way you're ever going to 
understand where you ad libbed and 

4166
02:56:04,471 --> 02:56:06,930
figuring out what those have lives are 
and whether or not they're valid.

4167
02:56:07,170 --> 02:56:08,520
When do you listen to it?
On the car?

4168
02:56:08,521 --> 02:56:09,420
On the way home.
Yeah.

4169
02:56:09,690 --> 02:56:13,560
That's the best way.
Or the next day on the car.

4170
02:56:13,561 --> 02:56:15,510
On the way to a,
the show again.

4171
02:56:15,750 --> 02:56:18,810
I'll listen to it because it's so nice 
because your phone just boost juice.

4172
02:56:19,250 --> 02:56:20,020
Yeah.
Yeah.

4173
02:56:20,020 --> 02:56:21,750
Up to the stereo.
It's great.

4174
02:56:21,751 --> 02:56:25,680
It's easy to do and sometimes it's 
painful.

4175
02:56:25,830 --> 02:56:27,810
Oh yeah.
Fuck Yeah Dude.

4176
02:56:27,811 --> 02:56:31,710
I just got done editing my special and 
you know,

4177
02:56:31,711 --> 02:56:33,540
sitting down there and listen in San 
Francisco.

4178
02:56:33,660 --> 02:56:34,493
Yeah.
You get it at the fillmore and dope and 

4179
02:56:36,091 --> 02:56:37,440
then go on the legion.
Thank you.

4180
02:56:37,470 --> 02:56:38,850
And then going and watching it.
It's like,

4181
02:56:38,880 --> 02:56:40,110
oh,
I hate myself.

4182
02:56:40,200 --> 02:56:41,550
I don't want to watch it.
That's gross.

4183
02:56:41,820 --> 02:56:43,230
You know?
Did you do it?

4184
02:56:43,231 --> 02:56:44,460
We just did three hours.
Okay,

4185
02:56:44,461 --> 02:56:45,390
we're done.
We're done.

4186
02:56:46,050 --> 02:56:47,340
We did it.
You gonna walk away.

4187
02:56:53,260 --> 02:56:54,093
Hold on.

4188
02:56:54,970 --> 02:56:56,800
He actually left.
Fetterman has left,

4189
02:56:56,801 --> 02:56:58,900
but I've got his phone.
It's a fake leaving.

4190
02:56:59,050 --> 02:57:01,720
You left your phone.
Did the bit.

4191
02:57:02,410 --> 02:57:04,180
That's wrap this up.
Let's do a wrap up.

4192
02:57:04,780 --> 02:57:07,210
Let's wrap this up.
How do we wrap up?

4193
02:57:07,450 --> 02:57:08,800
We don't,
we just,

4194
02:57:08,860 --> 02:57:13,100
it is no usual this.
The beautiful thing about podcasts,

4195
02:57:13,101 --> 02:57:15,190
man.
How many times you done podcast?

4196
02:57:15,560 --> 02:57:16,520
Manny,
manny,

4197
02:57:16,990 --> 02:57:17,823
manny,
come on up to the microphone so people 

4198
02:57:18,681 --> 02:57:19,610
can hear you.
Oh,

4199
02:57:19,611 --> 02:57:20,690
is that how you do it?
Yeah,

4200
02:57:20,800 --> 02:57:21,411
that,
there you go.

4201
02:57:21,411 --> 02:57:23,120
You gotta be up there.
You've done a bunch of them.

4202
02:57:23,180 --> 02:57:24,050
Yeah.
Yeah.

4203
02:57:24,320 --> 02:57:26,210
I've never done,
this is the longest I've ever known.

4204
02:57:26,300 --> 02:57:27,500
Have you ever thought about doing your 
own?

4205
02:57:28,130 --> 02:57:28,963
I did do one with the girl does.
It didn't work out because you fell in 

4206
02:57:31,581 --> 02:57:33,710
love.
Now here's interesting.

4207
02:57:33,740 --> 02:57:38,030
Choose 25 years younger than I am 
married and I'm single,

4208
02:57:38,031 --> 02:57:42,560
so we had this great back and forth.
Little bit of a tension.

4209
02:57:42,920 --> 02:57:44,250
Sexual tension,
I think,

4210
02:57:44,540 --> 02:57:45,470
unfortunately.
Yeah.

4211
02:57:45,471 --> 02:57:47,570
A little bit on your side or her side or
both.

4212
02:57:50,570 --> 02:57:51,403
Just leave it there.
Let's just leave it in nicely with this 

4213
02:57:52,740 --> 02:57:53,670
silly.
The hat.

4214
02:57:53,730 --> 02:57:55,510
Fetterman on twitter.
Yeah.

4215
02:57:57,270 --> 02:57:58,103
Whoever.
You are the guy who still awaiting 

4216
02:57:59,250 --> 02:58:00,840
fetterman.
Fuck you.

4217
02:58:01,860 --> 02:58:02,160
Fuck

4218
02:58:02,160 --> 02:58:03,860
you buddy.
Tried to get money from you,

4219
02:58:03,861 --> 02:58:05,940
right?
I think he wants some money.

4220
02:58:05,941 --> 02:58:08,070
Yeah.
Let's get twitter to get that back.

4221
02:58:08,280 --> 02:58:10,050
Jamie.
Contact them.

4222
02:58:10,260 --> 02:58:12,210
Get on that.
Get Chandra on it.

4223
02:58:12,540 --> 02:58:15,420
Thank you for inviting more.
Allowing me on your show.

4224
02:58:15,540 --> 02:58:20,540
I only invited you and number 200 820 
and 29 two 829 it hundred 20 how many of

4225
02:58:23,401 --> 02:58:26,190
those have you heard?
Completely back again?

4226
02:58:26,250 --> 02:58:30,000
At least five.
I would think it would be less than five

4227
02:58:30,090 --> 02:58:31,620
is more than the five.
Five.

4228
02:58:31,710 --> 02:58:34,620
I probably heard 12 it's pretty good.
I listen to very many.

4229
02:58:34,621 --> 02:58:37,590
I I how could you?
No time and I don't want to,

4230
02:58:38,100 --> 02:58:39,330
man.
It's out there.

4231
02:58:39,510 --> 02:58:40,320
Yeah,
but are you,

4232
02:58:40,320 --> 02:58:41,153
but it's again,
it's the same kind of thing like 

4233
02:58:42,331 --> 02:58:43,260
standup.
You learn,

4234
02:58:44,420 --> 02:58:45,253
you know,
when you talk too much or if you talk 

4235
02:58:46,261 --> 02:58:48,760
over people listen.
Yeah,

4236
02:58:48,930 --> 02:58:50,550
I know.
I feel like I interrupted you too much,

4237
02:58:50,551 --> 02:58:50,860
but,
oh,

4238
02:58:50,860 --> 02:58:51,540
you were great.

4239
02:58:51,540 --> 02:58:52,350
Thank you.
Thank you.

4240
02:58:52,350 --> 02:58:54,350
But I did have the,
uh,

4241
02:58:54,390 --> 02:58:56,880
I really appreciate the compliment,
the a,

4242
02:58:56,881 --> 02:58:59,100
that album,
the Jimi Hendrix experience.

4243
02:58:59,310 --> 02:59:00,600
My,
it was my older brother's,

4244
02:59:00,601 --> 02:59:01,434
but I remember Mitch Mitchell Aqui.
She could remember the name of the Bass 

4245
02:59:03,631 --> 02:59:04,800
player.
Do you remember his name?

4246
02:59:04,830 --> 02:59:08,370
No,
but those are replaceable white dudes.

4247
02:59:08,390 --> 02:59:09,960
No.
No.

4248
02:59:09,961 --> 02:59:14,430
I feel like they were never as good.
No reading is my guest.

4249
02:59:14,460 --> 02:59:15,780
That's off the top.
I'm not looking at,

4250
02:59:15,781 --> 02:59:16,614
you can tell them right now.
Am I looking at a computer and not 

4251
02:59:18,110 --> 02:59:19,230
looking at the computer?
Going to say no.

4252
02:59:19,231 --> 02:59:21,990
Ready.
Mitch Mitchell and then Jim Hendrix.

4253
02:59:21,991 --> 02:59:23,280
That's the way I used to call him.
All right.

4254
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:25,440
When fedderman ladies and gentlemen 
later.

4255
02:59:25,560 --> 02:59:26,940
Good bye.
See You tomorrow.

4256
02:59:26,941 --> 02:59:29,160
We'll be back tomorrow with Neal 
Brennan.

4257
02:59:29,330 --> 02:59:32,820
All right.
That was easy.
