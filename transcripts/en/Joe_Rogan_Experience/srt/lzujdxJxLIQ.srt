1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,050
Oh No,
no,

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:02,230
here we go.
Good.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,660
Here we go.
Three

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:12,330
to live.
Boom.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,300
We live.
Gentlemen.

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,900
Joe Freda.
Hey,

7
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:17,530
good to be here.
Good to see you guys.

8
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,450
It's happening.
Not much.

9
00:00:19,451 --> 00:00:21,160
We're in Sunny California.
Yeah,

10
00:00:21,161 --> 00:00:21,994
it's a too close to the sun.
A little bit barbecued over the last 

11
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:27,483
week and a half.
I've been hiding in a hotel for six 

12
00:00:28,301 --> 00:00:28,900
days.

13
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,520
How proper that we're here to talk 
about,

14
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,510
uh,
the apocalypse.

15
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,000
I was going to say your book is Joe 
Beef.

16
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:35,834
Surviving the apocalypse.
I'm a cookbook for surviving the 

17
00:00:39,321 --> 00:00:40,310
apocalypse.
What is the,

18
00:00:40,311 --> 00:00:41,430
what's the purpose of the,
uh,

19
00:00:41,431 --> 00:00:43,040
the title?
Just a goof.

20
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:44,613
We haven't written a book in years.
I don't think we really wanted to write 

21
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:48,340
a second book.
Uh,

22
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,430
when we started getting a bit of 
pressure to write a second one,

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,370
we Kinda,
you know,

24
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,720
laid down the gauntlet to the editors 
and said,

25
00:00:55,721 --> 00:00:57,970
we're going to write what we want.
Are you in,

26
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:58,930
are you out?
And they said,

27
00:00:58,931 --> 00:00:59,350
well,
you know,

28
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,960
show us a little bit of the framework of
that this is going to be.

29
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:03,430
I said,
I want to talk.

30
00:01:03,431 --> 00:01:04,264
I mean,
I'll cooking doesn't define me or Fred 

31
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,300
to stop all that we do.
Like it's,

32
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,410
you know,
you see some people,

33
00:01:08,411 --> 00:01:10,990
they seem to like eat live and breathe 
cooking.

34
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:13,770
I said,
no man,

35
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,150
I'm into the outdoors.
I meant the mushroom picking.

36
00:01:16,151 --> 00:01:20,260
I meant the fermentation of berries.
I'm into canoeing.

37
00:01:20,261 --> 00:01:23,050
I know all about canoes.
I love swimming in lakes.

38
00:01:23,051 --> 00:01:23,884
I want to talk about multiple subjects.
I want to talk about the native Mohawks 

39
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,620
of Quebec.
I wanted,

40
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,590
you know,
so I said,

41
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:34,710
let us write a book about the multiple 
subjects of which were into,

42
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,250
you know,
a joy.

43
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,163
If we're not cooking,
we're building first they'd get in 

44
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:45,730
survival gets for real,
really goes to like ll bean.

45
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,020
He has a lifetime membership there and I
have an off grade cabin up north,

46
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,090
like north of Montreal,
about an hour and a half.

47
00:01:52,091 --> 00:01:54,330
You can only get there by,
by boat,

48
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:59,760
a say kilometers from the landing,
a 2000 watts of solar power.

49
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,190
Completely off grid.
You can't even,

50
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,080
you can barely walk in because of the 
jagged cliffs all around it.

51
00:02:05,081 --> 00:02:05,914
And behind me is an old growth forest 
that's protected federally and I have a 

52
00:02:09,161 --> 00:02:14,161
suture kit and salient my car always 
cars outfitted,

53
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,740
like he's got shovels on the roof and a 
propane tanks on the roof.

54
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,920
Two years ago I drove to Alaska down 
South Arizona,

55
00:02:20,921 --> 00:02:22,330
back home.
Wow.

56
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,440
Twenty thousand miles.

57
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,153
I grew up in Boston and I did stand up 
in Montreal for the first time I think 

58
00:02:29,671 --> 00:02:30,504
in like 1991 or something like that.
And I remember thinking Boston was cold 

59
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,660
until I went to Montreal and I went,
Oh,

60
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,090
this is a different things.

61
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,660
We had the polar vortex last year come 
roaring through.

62
00:02:42,661 --> 00:02:43,494
I think all the pipes blue in all the 
restaurants I'm sure like January 

63
00:02:48,331 --> 00:02:49,164
second,
you know,

64
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,200
boy,
I was going to say is,

65
00:02:50,201 --> 00:02:53,860
do you think that living in such an 
extreme environment in a beautiful city,

66
00:02:53,861 --> 00:02:57,220
amazing city,
but it's an incredibly harsh environment

67
00:02:57,221 --> 00:03:00,310
in the winter.
Do you think that makes you more,

68
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,560
uh,
more cognizant?

69
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:06,100
It's always the need for survival.
It's always in the back of my head.

70
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:06,934
I have three daughters,
like I saw always in the back of my 

71
00:03:09,671 --> 00:03:10,091
head.
And said,

72
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:14,590
this is incredibly cold.
If the power goes out for 48 hours,

73
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:18,310
I have to start a plan b.
where am I bringing my babies?

74
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,820
What are we going to eat?
Where are we going to fit our city?

75
00:03:21,821 --> 00:03:22,654
Over the last couple of years I've been 
talking about a complete ban of 

76
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:30,520
fireplaces and wood burning stoves 
inside of homes,

77
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:31,354
condominiums and Hoe and houses,
the laws governing wood burning and the 

78
00:03:36,011 --> 00:03:38,950
city of Montreal are stricter than the 
ones in California.

79
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,590
Uh,
and we'd die.

80
00:03:41,591 --> 00:03:43,270
Man,
if we die,

81
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,340
I go,
this is irresponsible,

82
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,380
you know,
by the government to do this.

83
00:03:47,381 --> 00:03:48,131
I said,
okay,

84
00:03:48,131 --> 00:03:51,400
make sure we don't use them,
but let's all have them just in case.

85
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,080
Same goes for.
Because if a bit,

86
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,293
what are they worried about it for?
They're worried about their admission 

87
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:58,970
particulates.
Yes,

88
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,990
correct man.
But it smells good.

89
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:07,350
Like a nice woodburnings doesn't like 
this affects everybody.

90
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:09,610
This affects restaurants and grilling 
food.

91
00:04:09,611 --> 00:04:11,820
This affects barbecue.
This effects or you know,

92
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:14,860
a traditional bagels stores.
Traditional bagels stores.

93
00:04:14,861 --> 00:04:18,460
Cook with wood as I already said that.
Of course you go into Thailand,

94
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:19,870
St Theater,
Bagel,

95
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,860
fairmount,
Bagel,

96
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,753
all the other ones you smell it.
It's a massive part of our culture as 

97
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,380
well.
You have to understand that food wise,

98
00:04:26,381 --> 00:04:29,200
the province of Quebec,
the city of Quebec City and Montreal,

99
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,530
she's a first place is populated in 
North America.

100
00:04:32,531 --> 00:04:33,281
This is,
you know,

101
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:36,670
the Europeans to,
to get to anywhere in North America.

102
00:04:36,671 --> 00:04:39,880
Came through Quebec First New York 
afterwards.

103
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,420
The food culture in Quebec is over 400 
years old.

104
00:04:43,421 --> 00:04:46,270
You can't say that about over a thousand
years old.

105
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:47,670
Yeah,
yeah,

106
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,080
absolutely.
And then wood,

107
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,580
wood,
what is detrimental to that if it wasn't

108
00:04:51,581 --> 00:04:52,414
for burning wood,
I'm not saying we should do it for 

109
00:04:54,341 --> 00:04:56,290
historical purpose,
but like man,

110
00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:01,350
like if we run out of gas,
there's still would give you a ticket,

111
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,330
you know,
two grand because you're having a fire.

112
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,910
A few years ago,
about a decade ago,

113
00:05:06,911 --> 00:05:10,300
we had this crazy ice storm in Quebec,
you know,

114
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:14,470
the perfect storm of rain and then cold 
and then rain and then cold.

115
00:05:14,471 --> 00:05:17,700
All the power lines without the pylons 
crashing.

116
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,060
Got Thick with ice,
right?

117
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,200
Yeah.
For two weeks.

118
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,213
Yeah,
two weeks and there's a baby boom right 

119
00:05:21,941 --> 00:05:22,774
after that because people stayed home,
no television and no heat and then 

120
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,110
procreated.
Then there was a true baby boom.

121
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:31,780
Nine months later there was a ton of new
kids born.

122
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,830
That's hilarious.
Do you know the,

123
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:38,050
the deep freeze.
It also cleans the city in the winter,

124
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,213
so from your perspective,
the shit hits the fan and come and see 

125
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:43,534
us because it,
it's a pretty good city to survive 

126
00:05:46,241 --> 00:05:47,380
anything,
you know?

127
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,730
It's a pretty neat place because the 
winter just sanitizes everything.

128
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:53,830
You start again every year.
Yeah.

129
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:58,120
As opposed to la where you never really 
get that cleaned

130
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,320
down.
You'll never have a long haul.

131
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,180
Yeah,
you do like a horse bath,

132
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,813
you know,
you just get it like a year in a 

133
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,013
restroom somewhere with paper towels 
that you went down and sort of get your 

134
00:06:08,871 --> 00:06:11,900
underarms or whatever.
That's what La is,

135
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:12,880
the wet towel,
let's.

136
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,060
Yes,
yes.

137
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:19,370
So you just wanted to write a book that 
kind of covers all of your interests,

138
00:06:19,371 --> 00:06:20,204
not just with food,
but one of the things that I really 

139
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:23,084
enjoyed about there was an episode that 
you guys did have a Anthony Bourdain's 

140
00:06:26,381 --> 00:06:31,381
show where you were ice fishing and you 
had one of those ice fishing huts

141
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,213
and you get into cooked it.
Tony told you it's notorious and they 

142
00:06:35,801 --> 00:06:36,634
show that they never caught fish and 
whenever he had a gun he never hit 

143
00:06:40,451 --> 00:06:41,284
anything.
So we knew that we knew that there was 

144
00:06:43,721 --> 00:06:46,630
not a pike and there was not a Walleye 
that was going to bite.

145
00:06:46,631 --> 00:06:48,010
So we're like,
okay,

146
00:06:48,011 --> 00:06:50,680
option a.
We sit there and take some fake fish and

147
00:06:50,681 --> 00:06:53,170
we fry it up in cornflakes,
in shortening.

148
00:06:53,171 --> 00:06:57,280
And the hollow cabin where we just went 
like joe beef crazy.

149
00:06:57,281 --> 00:07:00,100
And we brought all the old cookbooks.
We add all the spirits,

150
00:07:00,101 --> 00:07:03,550
like Cuban cigars,
all the copper where all this stuff.

151
00:07:03,551 --> 00:07:05,870
And we made the menu from an Old Leon,
a restaurant,

152
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,180
Paul bocuse that he did a show at after 
and in.

153
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:12,970
He knew nothing about that day and we 
just went from fishing after he asked us

154
00:07:12,971 --> 00:07:17,971
about like strippers and Quebec and just
a few funny banter and it was.

155
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,350
We just went in and was like magical.
It's.

156
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:24,610
It was seriously fence a 10th of the 
size of this room here.

157
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:25,421
Yeah.
It was a tiny,

158
00:07:25,421 --> 00:07:27,760
tiny little shack and he tapped out that
day.

159
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:28,600
Yeah.
Yeah.

160
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,730
He was having a good time and we hit 
that.

161
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:35,350
We brought some fine wines and fine 
spirits from some really rare oddities.

162
00:07:35,351 --> 00:07:36,184
Some old charts,
rows and stuff like that that Fred had 

163
00:07:37,781 --> 00:07:38,614
lying around

164
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,570
and,
and Tony was,

165
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,770
was fun as arts up on the screen right 
there.

166
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,420
He let it go a bit,
you know,

167
00:07:45,421 --> 00:07:47,970
he just,
he calmed down and enjoyed us and let us

168
00:07:47,971 --> 00:07:49,930
do our thing.
I'm a bit fatter.

169
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,903
Oh God.

170
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,280
Those in the wine drinking days too,
right?

171
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,240
Yeah,
correct.

172
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,800
Look at that.
God,

173
00:07:57,801 --> 00:07:58,634
that looks good.
Is that Fagua in some sort of mashed 

174
00:07:59,981 --> 00:08:00,814
potatoes or something?

175
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,180
Yeah,
that's a wild rabbit.

176
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:04,390
It's a French recipe.
It's gold hair a lot.

177
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,143
Were you,
you cook the hair for a long time and 

178
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:13,910
hair and you serve it with truffles and 
you take,

179
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,773
you keep the blood.
This hair is snared so it's still full 

180
00:08:16,911 --> 00:08:17,744
of blood and you keep the blood and at 
the end you thicken the sauce with the 

181
00:08:20,181 --> 00:08:21,320
blood flow.
All right.

182
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,060
It's very good and I bet you,
you know,

183
00:08:23,061 --> 00:08:23,894
it's funny.
I bet you a fits all the principles of 

184
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,580
nutrition.
Now you know it's like blood and all the

185
00:08:28,581 --> 00:08:31,220
organ meats and all the same with 
cheese.

186
00:08:31,221 --> 00:08:34,430
Look,
this is like the airport right there,

187
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:35,870
isn't it?
That is interesting,

188
00:08:35,871 --> 00:08:36,970
right?
That no one

189
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,520
thought of that until recently that that
was what it was,

190
00:08:39,521 --> 00:08:40,354
that people just thought of it as cheese
and now people think of it as there's 

191
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:47,540
live cultures on it and Oregon meat is 
much healthier for you and people are so

192
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:48,550
much more.

193
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,383
Look at the cheese thing too.
It's like nowadays a lot of the 

194
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:56,070
probiotic makers are doing like a light 
bulb.

195
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:56,903
Deliveries.
They coded in fat so it resists the 

196
00:08:58,201 --> 00:08:59,510
stomach acid.
Right?

197
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,360
But that's fat probiotic from Jesus 
covered in fat.

198
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,313
You did after your dinner,
it lives through you and it all in a 

199
00:09:07,951 --> 00:09:10,140
perfect world that comes from right 
around your house.

200
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,003
Right?
So you eat a cheese and the probiotics 

201
00:09:12,571 --> 00:09:14,520
are the same one that you're going to 
encounter later.

202
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:18,900
So you kind of get immunized in a way 
that's the benefit.

203
00:09:18,901 --> 00:09:21,000
That's what true local is,
right?

204
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:21,834
Right.
Yeah.

205
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,560
Is there

206
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,660
benefit to eating cheese after meal?
Yeah,

207
00:09:24,661 --> 00:09:26,730
sure it is.
When it's a very pungent,

208
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,520
uh,
advanced alive raw cheese,

209
00:09:29,521 --> 00:09:32,940
it'll be seen ultimately as a 
nonalcoholic Dj Steve,

210
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,000
what does a Dj to,
to,

211
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:39,000
to help stimulate digestion?
Oh no kidding.

212
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,600
So it's almost like an enzyme,
like a,

213
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:41,540
like a probiotic,

214
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,100
but mostly.
And now they're,

215
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,480
they're figuring this out that the 
problem of the low fat diet than the,

216
00:09:48,481 --> 00:09:50,670
you know,
like brown rice and chicken breast,

217
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,080
you know,
the bodybuilder diet.

218
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,573
Nothing triggers your fullness because 
they realized that fat actually makes 

219
00:09:57,391 --> 00:10:00,300
you full quite fast.
Right?

220
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,520
So if you eat a bit of cheese,
you're done.

221
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:03,443
You tap out after,
you don't need like a full plate of 

222
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:05,994
cheese or layered on a hamburger,
but just a little bit of cheese after 

223
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:14,010
just cuts you off and then you have 
spirits and cigars are not that healthy,

224
00:10:14,011 --> 00:10:14,740
but

225
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,573
yeah,
I've been talking about that with a lot 

226
00:10:16,661 --> 00:10:18,610
of nutrition experts where they say that
your body,

227
00:10:18,611 --> 00:10:19,444
when it eats a lot of carbohydrates,
you can consume carbohydrates far past 

228
00:10:22,481 --> 00:10:23,314
what you actually need.
Whereas if you're just eating a lot of 

229
00:10:25,031 --> 00:10:25,864
fat and protein,
your body tends to regulate itself much 

230
00:10:27,821 --> 00:10:28,560
better.
Satiate.

231
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,340
Yeah.
Yeah.

232
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,760
Yeah.
Now you guys,

233
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,400
how long have you been in Montreal and 
then I have to tell you,

234
00:10:33,401 --> 00:10:34,234
and I've said it before,
if I had a say my all time favorite 

235
00:10:37,331 --> 00:10:38,164
restaurant.
I think joe beefs my all time favorite 

236
00:10:39,611 --> 00:10:40,444
restaurant.
I don't like to say my all time number 

237
00:10:42,131 --> 00:10:43,960
because there's a lot of great 
restaurants in this world,

238
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,730
but damn,
if I had to choose one,

239
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,610
I think I might choose.
You guys know you're very kind,

240
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,070
but we have to take you out to other 
places to change your mind.

241
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,890
I don't think you've got a man,
you guys are the kind of,

242
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,750
if you're a horse lover,
turn your head,

243
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,280
plug your ears,
you guys.

244
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:00,010
The first people that ever served me 
horse and I was like,

245
00:11:00,011 --> 00:11:01,290
what?
When he brought over,

246
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:05,350
it was a horse horse tenderloin and I 
was like,

247
00:11:05,351 --> 00:11:06,184
what the fuck?
You guys are eating horse up here and 

248
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:10,510
horse tar tar.
But it's a stigma,

249
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,090
you know,
let's say a cow and Elica buys in a deer

250
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,063
forest.
It's four legged animal and you know 

251
00:11:16,331 --> 00:11:17,164
what if I put,
if I put a buys in tenderloin and serve 

252
00:11:20,501 --> 00:11:24,250
you a beef tenderloin and a cow 
tenderloin and that deer tender lights,

253
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:25,570
at the end of the day it's,
you know,

254
00:11:25,571 --> 00:11:28,030
it's just has a couple of degrees of 
separation from the other.

255
00:11:28,031 --> 00:11:29,860
It's all flesh really.
It's,

256
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,753
it's very subjective that we base or 
nutritional choices and how pretty or 

257
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,090
how cute an animal is,
you know,

258
00:11:38,091 --> 00:11:39,290
it doesn't make sense.
You know,

259
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,590
and we're lucky now we're able to choose
where we eat.

260
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,710
It wasn't like that a hundred years ago.
You know,

261
00:11:45,711 --> 00:11:46,544
the purpose of the food guide until like
40 years ago was to make sure you had 

262
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,340
enough galleries.
Now we're in an age of restriction,

263
00:11:52,341 --> 00:11:54,010
so we like,
I don't

264
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:54,843
want horse,
I prefer deer or I prefer veal or add 

265
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:59,440
chicken yesterday.
Can't have twice a neuro.

266
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:00,853
Like all this is a bit of fluff,
what we do in a way because we're so 

267
00:12:03,491 --> 00:12:06,220
fortunate to have enough food to decide.

268
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:11,870
Remy Warren was on a backpacking,
horseback elk hunt and one of the horses

269
00:12:13,201 --> 00:12:14,790
fell down,
broke its leg,

270
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:15,863
and they had to make a decision.
They were deep in the back country and 

271
00:12:17,161 --> 00:12:20,460
they had to shoot it and it was just 
wasn't gonna get out of there.

272
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,383
And after they shot it,
he decided that really this sound was 

273
00:12:26,581 --> 00:12:27,414
going to go to waste.
So they took the back straps off and 

274
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,800
they cooked it and ate it and they said 
it was a really weird moment where like,

275
00:12:34,801 --> 00:12:37,080
this is the animal that was like 
everybody's petting it.

276
00:12:37,081 --> 00:12:38,260
And it was,
you were,

277
00:12:38,261 --> 00:12:40,800
you know,
you're riding it and it just,

278
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,693
it was a working animal,
but it was an animal that you loved and 

279
00:12:43,441 --> 00:12:45,630
then all of a sudden it's down and you 
have to kill it.

280
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:46,141
And he's like,
well,

281
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:47,490
it's going to go to waste.
He said,

282
00:12:47,491 --> 00:12:49,950
it just felt wrong to let it go,
to waste.

283
00:12:49,951 --> 00:12:51,880
So they cut the backstraps off of it.
The

284
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:56,830
other reason I think we don't eat horace
culturally is really based ultimately on

285
00:12:56,831 --> 00:13:00,880
the battle of Wolf between Mount Column 
on the plains of Quebec City.

286
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,370
Uh,
you know,

287
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:05,800
that was a decisive battle in North 
American history.

288
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:09,070
Whereas if the French had won that 
battle,

289
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:12,160
everybody in North America,
ultimately we'd be speaking French.

290
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:15,460
You know,
they didn't win that battle.

291
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,833
So British rule imposed.
So in England you did indeed horace by 

292
00:13:20,351 --> 00:13:23,120
royal decree,
but in the franchise horace,

293
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,750
the Belgians had horse,
the Germans eat horse,

294
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,710
you see.
So that's what it is.

295
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,330
Very old history,
you know,

296
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:33,150
it was mining,
it was potent and anglophone world.

297
00:13:33,151 --> 00:13:34,260
We'd Horace and,
and,

298
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,970
and all the mining countries.
A half.

299
00:13:36,971 --> 00:13:37,804
My family's from Belgium.
And it's traditional there because they 

300
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,200
bring the horse in,
the mine,

301
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,810
the horse,
you know,

302
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:45,250
sad for a horse to live in the mind,
in the dark.

303
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,740
But they wouldn't bring it out when he 
was old,

304
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,720
you know,
they would just eat the horse.

305
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,190
Most cultures eat Turkish,
eat horse know.

306
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,340
Well,
it was a necessity.

307
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,353
I mean,
you couldn't pick and choose back when 

308
00:13:56,771 --> 00:13:57,604
all this was instituted.
We're very limited in the proteins that 

309
00:14:00,101 --> 00:14:02,350
we eat.
And especially in North America,

310
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,580
Quebec last.
So you know,

311
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,190
Quebec has a very openminded dining,
public,

312
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,860
very advanced dining public,
very old dining public,

313
00:14:08,861 --> 00:14:11,500
and of course Latin French dining,
public.

314
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,023
The amount of proteins that are served 
in a Montreal restaurant are numerous 

315
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,230
compared to,
let's say,

316
00:14:20,231 --> 00:14:21,064
even when I go to Manhattan,
if me and you and Fred are in Manhattan 

317
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,420
tomorrow night,
say,

318
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,180
let's go have rabbit with mustard sauce,
it's going to be a tough sell.

319
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,000
We're going to really struggle to find 
rabbit mustard sauce.

320
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:33,250
We're going to struggle even to find a,
you know,

321
00:14:33,251 --> 00:14:35,500
let's go have a couple of slices of 
liver tonight with onions.

322
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:38,260
It's gonna be very difficult.
Solid lab,

323
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,680
NAC liver deer is a hard,
tall order,

324
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:42,514
you know,
intimately Manhattan or America eats a 

325
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:46,210
limited scope of proteins,
beef,

326
00:14:46,211 --> 00:14:47,950
chicken,
so forth.

327
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,510
Whereas,
you know,

328
00:14:49,511 --> 00:14:50,920
French culture,
Quebec,

329
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:52,130
you

330
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,840
know,
we have all the proteins.

331
00:14:53,841 --> 00:14:58,040
I have young dining clientele that have 
no problem eating kidneys,

332
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,650
medium rare,
a liver,

333
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:01,540
lamb,
liver,

334
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,140
dear neck,
dear heart,

335
00:15:03,141 --> 00:15:03,974
tar tar.
It's not a thing like it's not what 

336
00:15:05,691 --> 00:15:09,780
other restaurant people are eating.
Part of the registry and little girl.

337
00:15:09,781 --> 00:15:11,930
It was like your daughters raised 
eating,

338
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,033
you know,
the food that their dad hunts and the 

339
00:15:14,751 --> 00:15:19,751
food that their parents by some people 
of lesser means eat pork liver raised on

340
00:15:21,351 --> 00:15:22,184
it.
So when they see liver on the 

341
00:15:22,941 --> 00:15:24,320
restaurant,
cute little,

342
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,180
you know,
a 19 year old girls that are about to go

343
00:15:26,181 --> 00:15:28,370
out to the club later but have a slice 
of liver.

344
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,720
You won't see that.
New York City.

345
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,530
Are you allowed to sell Benison in here 
that you hunt?

346
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,310
No,
not that you hunt.

347
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,640
You have to buy by farm raised stuff and
oddly enough,

348
00:15:37,641 --> 00:15:38,930
most of it's from New Zealand.

349
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,793
Most of the stuff that we're getting 
here in the United States is from New 

350
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,673
Zealand and if they call it venison,
it's most likely some sort of stag or 

351
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,600
you know,
and the elk that we get,

352
00:15:47,601 --> 00:15:51,840
if we buy Elkanah restaurant,
it's all from New Zealand harvest.

353
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,420
When you,
when you do a kill,

354
00:15:53,421 --> 00:15:55,490
you can put it in your freezer.
Okay,

355
00:15:55,491 --> 00:15:56,061
perfect.
Yeah,

356
00:15:56,061 --> 00:15:58,340
we'll all,
I have two freezers back here.

357
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,560
Um,
all of,

358
00:15:59,561 --> 00:16:01,610
um,
the elk that I get,

359
00:16:01,611 --> 00:16:02,444
I get for myself that I hunt and I give 
it to a lot of my friends and I make 

360
00:16:04,941 --> 00:16:07,030
sausages from my friends and I sent,
you know,

361
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,173
but that's the only way they're gonna 
get it unless they go out and get it 

362
00:16:10,311 --> 00:16:11,144
themselves.
It's not a place in Los Angeles where 

363
00:16:12,531 --> 00:16:17,531
you can go by elk meat and new in 
Newfoundland that they're allowed to.

364
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,780
Hunters are allowed to sell moose back 
to the restaurants.

365
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,561
Really?
Yeah.

366
00:16:21,561 --> 00:16:25,070
Moose for introduced onto the island of 
Newfoundland from Maine.

367
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:28,130
And there was no natural predators on 
Newfoundland.

368
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:31,100
So the mood and it's a perfect 
environment for them.

369
00:16:31,101 --> 00:16:35,090
So they just propagated.
So that's why they take drive slow.

370
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,880
They're we shot with Tony,
they drove slow,

371
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,013
like we drove for hours,
like full days to go like 300 miles 

372
00:16:42,441 --> 00:16:43,274
because you can't drive fast because of 
the Moose is so you can have a 

373
00:16:46,611 --> 00:16:48,610
restaurant in the hotel.
We stayed,

374
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:49,963
the restaurant had a permit to buy Moose
so they would make like Moose curry and 

375
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:56,840
moves us days in kind of vibe.
Like I'm not a great restaurant,

376
00:16:56,841 --> 00:16:57,674
like a hotel,
a hotel restaurant serving wild moose 

377
00:17:00,921 --> 00:17:04,010
burgers.
But it's pretty cool that they do that.

378
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,560
That is cool.
But if they did that everywhere else,

379
00:17:06,561 --> 00:17:08,390
then we're just reinventing the wheel,
you know,

380
00:17:08,391 --> 00:17:08,900
we're rolling.

381
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,733
We're going back to market hunting,
which is what almost wiped out almost 

382
00:17:12,321 --> 00:17:13,154
all of the animals in this country.
And some shops in Quebec would like to 

383
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,600
bring that back.
And I,

384
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,510
you know,
I said listen,

385
00:17:17,511 --> 00:17:19,880
we can barely manage our roads,
our infrastructure,

386
00:17:19,881 --> 00:17:20,714
we can barely manage like our.
And that's the risk of foraging through 

387
00:17:23,271 --> 00:17:24,170
it.
Like eventually,

388
00:17:24,171 --> 00:17:25,790
you know,
like people go for mushrooms.

389
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:26,624
It's like you heard about the fights 
between the mushroom pickers in Oregon 

390
00:17:29,301 --> 00:17:30,540
and stuff like that.
We're no.

391
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,910
Oh fuck.
Like the people who harvest clams do it.

392
00:17:33,911 --> 00:17:34,744
They'd like between the communities.
There's huge fights for territories and 

393
00:17:37,341 --> 00:17:42,210
they hijack like trucks of abalone at 
night and gooey duck.

394
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,050
The giant King Clam.
Yeah.

395
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:44,923
I've heard stories of a guide on an 
economy line van with 500 pounds of 

396
00:17:49,141 --> 00:17:49,980
gooey duck going

397
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,440
to the Victoria airport to send them to 
Japan,

398
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,693
get hijacked on the highway at night and
they steal the clams because they're 

399
00:17:56,191 --> 00:17:59,850
worth a fortune in Japan and same for 
mushroom matsutake.

400
00:17:59,851 --> 00:18:02,790
Mushrooms are as well and other earth is
famous white.

401
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,210
It's called a pine mushroom and then 
Japan to matsutake mushrooms.

402
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,060
The closer,
the shape of the mushroom to a penis,

403
00:18:09,061 --> 00:18:10,560
the more expensive it is,
you know,

404
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:14,350
so they like,
they actually hijack people in their way

405
00:18:14,351 --> 00:18:15,184
through the patch and like undressed 
them and make them turn around so they 

406
00:18:18,691 --> 00:18:20,760
can never find the place again.
Wow.

407
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:24,300
This competitive Morel mushrooms.
You look a morel mushroom.

408
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,170
It's a.
You know,

409
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,033
how much Fred for very expensive?
40 four bucks a kilo in Montreal and 

410
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,570
pull this a little closer to just 
credit.

411
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:34,110
Keep it brought up fist from your face.
Yeah,

412
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,840
the Morel Mushrooms.
I buy them online.

413
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,673
They're very expensive.
I buy them dried and they're so 

414
00:18:39,331 --> 00:18:42,030
delicious.
I mean people who don't like mushrooms,

415
00:18:42,031 --> 00:18:44,220
like one of my daughters does not like 
mushrooms,

416
00:18:44,221 --> 00:18:46,290
but she loves morale.
It's my favorite.

417
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,580
It's a number one mushroom.
Good with salted,

418
00:18:48,581 --> 00:18:51,600
with garlic,
salt and sauteed in butter.

419
00:18:51,601 --> 00:18:53,160
They're sensational.
Great Mushroom,

420
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,670
strange flavor.
One of our favorite.

421
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:59,280
There's a great recipe for that in the 
book is poached chicken legs,

422
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,130
right until they're ready and then into 
the broth.

423
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,590
Very little broth.
You know,

424
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:06,240
you strain the broth,
you add cream and salt.

425
00:19:06,241 --> 00:19:09,480
They Morel mushrooms in there and a 
little bit of Sherry wine.

426
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:10,314
Any of oxidized wine and you just add 
the legs in there and you let you let 

427
00:19:13,321 --> 00:19:14,071
that simmer.
Man.

428
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:14,904
That's good.
We have a picture in the book of some 

429
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,110
Morel Mushrooms are the size of these 
water bottles.

430
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,230
We've had morel mushrooms that are about
the size of my hand.

431
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:25,660
You can stuff like half a chicken leg 
inside of them and serve one stuff.

432
00:19:25,661 --> 00:19:28,380
Morel mushroom and Bra for one customer.
It's brilliant.

433
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:31,410
They're a strange mushroom,
right?

434
00:19:31,411 --> 00:19:34,080
Where they.
They pop up after burns.

435
00:19:34,081 --> 00:19:35,880
Yeah,
and they also have spraying mushroom,

436
00:19:35,881 --> 00:19:40,650
which is weird because most of the other
mushrooms or later on damp.

437
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:44,100
Right.
And morale is like literally quite quick

438
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:44,934
after the snow.
That's the first mushroom that appears 

439
00:19:46,471 --> 00:19:47,304
in the forest.
So it's a very different than all the 

440
00:19:48,631 --> 00:19:50,520
others.
Are they commercially cultivated?

441
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:54,030
They could be,
but not.

442
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,300
I've never seen it.
My career tried growing mushrooms.

443
00:19:56,301 --> 00:19:57,134
We tried everything at the restaurant.
I tried growing mushrooms and like you 

444
00:19:59,311 --> 00:20:02,580
get everything but the mushroom,
you inoculate,

445
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,970
it was very difficult to keep the proper
conditions and stuff.

446
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,820
That's why I'm not against the fact that
they're expensive,

447
00:20:08,821 --> 00:20:09,654
you know,
it's a good way to regulate a market 

448
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,150
price,
you know?

449
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,080
It's like,
yeah,

450
00:20:13,081 --> 00:20:15,030
you know,
bluefin tuna is going extinct,

451
00:20:15,031 --> 00:20:18,510
but just make it three times the price.
It's going to regulate the market.

452
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,373
You know?
I guess I wish there was a way to 

453
00:20:20,821 --> 00:20:21,654
reintroduce Bluefin to the wild.
It's just seems like the appetite that 

454
00:20:25,111 --> 00:20:27,090
people have for those things,
it's just untenable.

455
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:31,740
Give you a look at any given night in a 
city like Manhattan,

456
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,143
how much red tuna is sold on the island 
of Manhattan any given night of the 

457
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:38,660
year.
It's,

458
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,140
it's,
it's scary.

459
00:20:40,141 --> 00:20:40,974
I almost feel like it's like killing the
last giraffe in a herd like fishing a 

460
00:20:44,881 --> 00:20:48,280
giant tuna like that.
It's and again,

461
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,430
you know that they're big,
they're feisty.

462
00:20:51,431 --> 00:20:55,390
They're majestic,
so that should in guide my choice,

463
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,130
my decision and to protect them.
But like I said,

464
00:20:58,630 --> 00:20:59,463
that's heartbreaking.
The problem is the complete lack of 

465
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:02,374
regulation on the open waters when these
guys have these enormous ships filled 

466
00:21:05,741 --> 00:21:06,574
with huge nance and just drag them 
across the ocean floor and capture 

467
00:21:10,121 --> 00:21:12,710
everything that you catch.
And that's the biggest disconnect.

468
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:17,750
It's like they call it bycatch.
So you didn't set up the fish for tuna,

469
00:21:17,801 --> 00:21:19,880
but that's what kind of bit,
you know,

470
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,153
like,
yeah,

471
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,600
come on.
You know,

472
00:21:22,601 --> 00:21:23,434
you go fishing for what?
To catch a Bluefin tuna in the first 

473
00:21:25,121 --> 00:21:25,954
place,
you know,

474
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,430
place.
Oh,

475
00:21:27,431 --> 00:21:28,170
so they're,
they're,

476
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:30,390
they're pretending they're not fishing 
for it.

477
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,110
Is that what you're saying?
Oh,

478
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,380
allegedly.
Well,

479
00:21:32,381 --> 00:21:34,450
you know,
that whole thing was Japanese whalers.

480
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,613
They found a way to work around it and 
the way the world's largest science 

481
00:21:38,111 --> 00:21:38,944
research posts,
so the science research where we're 

482
00:21:40,931 --> 00:21:41,764
going to do research on these whales 
that we kill and then they chop them up 

483
00:21:43,661 --> 00:21:44,494
and sell them and sea shepherd has been 
tracking that down and they hover over 

484
00:21:49,361 --> 00:21:53,800
them and take photographs of it and 
report them and now it's ugly business,

485
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:56,883
ugly business.

486
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,130
We've worked hard at the restaurant 
until I'm ultimately avoid it to be more

487
00:22:00,131 --> 00:22:02,410
seafood,
sustainable seafood focused.

488
00:22:02,411 --> 00:22:04,960
You know,
the oyster is a great thing to eat.

489
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,060
We should eat oysters,
clams,

490
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:08,973
Florida.
Oddly as an amazing sustainable seafood 

491
00:22:10,751 --> 00:22:11,350
scene.
You know,

492
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:16,120
just the work that they do with the 
Florida stone crab,

493
00:22:16,121 --> 00:22:16,954
right?
You know that every year they just 

494
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:22,090
harvest like the left arm and they put,
they put the crap back and the next year

495
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:24,430
it's the right arm and they put the crab
back real.

496
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:26,350
Yeah.
It's a brilliant fishing industry.

497
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:27,683
They don't kill the animal,
the clog rows back and it's a side 

498
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,613
side-by-side sound like that.
You're telling me something good about 

499
00:22:36,551 --> 00:22:39,460
Florida,
they have a great shrimping,

500
00:22:39,461 --> 00:22:40,294
seen a great,
that they're actually leaders in 

501
00:22:42,131 --> 00:22:42,964
sustainable seafood.
Seafood and fishing is such a gigantic 

502
00:22:46,181 --> 00:22:48,430
part of their economy.
It makes sense that they would do that.

503
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:52,240
That's a smart thing.
Grouper fishing down there is a giant,

504
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:56,440
giant part of there.
There's a good book that was published a

505
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,191
few years ago.
The big oyster,

506
00:22:57,191 --> 00:23:00,220
I think mark Galinsky,
he wrote a book about the history of the

507
00:23:00,221 --> 00:23:01,054
oyster,
the New York and the history of the 

508
00:23:02,111 --> 00:23:03,100
oyster.
That's incredible.

509
00:23:03,101 --> 00:23:05,950
Super interesting because this is his 
thing was like,

510
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:09,520
you know,
we try to portray or history as glorious

511
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:10,354
and we heard it bisons before for 
protein and that's how we started like 

512
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,793
modern farming,
but in fact we probably farmed oysters 

513
00:23:17,381 --> 00:23:18,214
and snails and clients because they 
don't move and they are the most 

514
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:22,983
prolific and the most abundant source of
protein in that book are landscape 

515
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:28,743
brings up a premise,
and I'm loosely interpreting it now 

516
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:32,950
because I read this book a few years 
ago,

517
00:23:32,951 --> 00:23:37,210
but think of this for a second,
right?

518
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:42,330
The island of Manhattan a is a perfect.
All the rivers around it,

519
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:43,323
all the water systems around it is 
actually one of the greater oyster 

520
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:47,150
situations

521
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,540
on the Atlantic east coast,
right.

522
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:51,643
The reason that the population exploded 
in Manhattan in the early days was that 

523
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:58,040
any person could literally get off a 
boat,

524
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:02,390
walk onto the island of Manhattan 
homeless,

525
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:07,630
broke and sleeping an alley and walk 
down to the river and pick five oysters.

526
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,420
A small oyster is five grams of protein,
right?

527
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:16,880
A medium oysters got 10 grams of 
protein,

528
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:21,590
so completely destitute person could 
just eat six oysters a day,

529
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:24,440
you know,
three oysters and live again another day

530
00:24:24,441 --> 00:24:28,160
to find a job.
So the population ultimately,

531
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,033
you know,
New York City and its population was 

532
00:24:31,311 --> 00:24:35,600
based on this readily supply,
this huge supply of oysters.

533
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,013
Wow.
Yeah.

534
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:38,203
That's free.
Available source of protein that will 

535
00:24:41,301 --> 00:24:42,134
make you live another 24 hours.
So if it takes you three days to find a 

536
00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:47,570
job for days to find a job at 20 days to
find a job,

537
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:49,730
you're not going to die because there's 
oysters.

538
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,140
Look at this and yeah,

539
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:52,083
and they,
they,

540
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,440
they found from the fuck.
What is this from Harlem River Oysters.

541
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:57,340
Credible.
Yeah.

542
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,313
There's a actual islands that they 
thought were like Geo geological 

543
00:25:02,471 --> 00:25:04,690
formation that are made of oyster 
shells.

544
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,793
This layers and layers of oyster shells.
The article that Jamie put up is from 

545
00:25:08,651 --> 00:25:11,540
thrillist is I would pull up to the top 
so I can tell people the order,

546
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,453
the news,
why oysters are ridiculously important 

547
00:25:15,551 --> 00:25:20,080
to the history of New York City and it 
just showing all these ancient photos of

548
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:23,920
mounds of oyster shells and is an 
amazing program today.

549
00:25:23,921 --> 00:25:26,840
You know,
some of the areas that there's.

550
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:29,680
That they take these giant cages.
One Oyster,

551
00:25:29,681 --> 00:25:30,530
if I'm correct,

552
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:36,090
oyster filters for metric tons of water 
per day.

553
00:25:36,581 --> 00:25:38,680
From what I understand,
I might be wrong with my math,

554
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:41,200
so take this.
For instance,

555
00:25:41,201 --> 00:25:45,880
you know a cage,
a cage box of thousands of oysters.

556
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:46,803
There it is.

557
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:51,220
Single Oyster can filter about 30 to 50 
gallons of water every day.

558
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:52,123
Little loose math job,
digital New York's waterways on exactly 

559
00:25:56,541 --> 00:25:57,374
the cleanest the folks behind the 
billion oyster project or trying to 

560
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:02,330
change that by recycling shells from the
part,

561
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,900
partnering restaurants and getting them 
back in the water to build oyster reefs.

562
00:26:05,901 --> 00:26:09,530
The goal is to add a billion oysters to 
the water by 20,

563
00:26:09,531 --> 00:26:11,480
35.
So far they're restored.

564
00:26:11,481 --> 00:26:12,800
One point.
Oh,

565
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:15,620
one acre.
One point five acres of reason.

566
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,790
Well,
don't say one point.

567
00:26:16,791 --> 00:26:17,660
Oh,
five bid sheet.

568
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,220
You got an acre.
Oh,

569
00:26:19,221 --> 00:26:21,140
that's you just add in those extra two 
numbers.

570
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:21,951
One point.
Oh,

571
00:26:21,951 --> 00:26:25,400
five acres of reefs and count 11 point 5
million.

572
00:26:25,401 --> 00:26:28,490
Newly grown oysters.
But the oysters will clarify the water.

573
00:26:28,491 --> 00:26:31,580
It'll make a murky river clear again.
Wow.

574
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:33,800
But it didn't affect the taste of the 
oyster.

575
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:34,663
They don't eat those oysters.
I think those are pulled back into 

576
00:26:36,201 --> 00:26:39,110
landfill after or mulched into gardens 
or for.

577
00:26:39,111 --> 00:26:42,740
The shells are banned from where reef.
But the oyster is interesting.

578
00:26:42,741 --> 00:26:43,590
It doesn't.
Right?

579
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:47,970
It opens its shells to the feed,
showing how they do it.

580
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,740
This is incredible.
And the oyster,

581
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:50,574
you know that the oyster has a.
It will change gender according to the 

582
00:26:53,851 --> 00:26:57,690
density of the population,
so it'll go from male to female in order

583
00:26:57,691 --> 00:27:00,210
to balance the center.
That's incredible.

584
00:27:00,211 --> 00:27:02,190
We're watching a video where the.
What is it?

585
00:27:02,191 --> 00:27:04,710
The oyster recovery was.
It was the timeline.

586
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:06,043
Oh,
sorry.

587
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,950
So it's a timelapse,
but it said what,

588
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,170
what does it say?
It was from a filtration.

589
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:11,004
Right.
But there was a watermark on the video 

590
00:27:12,811 --> 00:27:15,240
there on the corner.
It was showing receipts.

591
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:17,740
Yeah.
Oyster recovery partnership.

592
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,693
So the watermark is.
So what they do is they have this 

593
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:24,750
horrible green water chuck these oysters
in and it turns it completely clear.

594
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:27,480
That's amazing.
I did not know that.

595
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:28,703
I didn't know that they used to eat 
lobsters and they thought of lobster 

596
00:27:31,141 --> 00:27:36,141
says poor people food out of the river 
in New Brunswick.

597
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,490
They used to,
um,

598
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,473
harvests lobsters to feed to the 
prisoners and keep the shells as 

599
00:27:42,991 --> 00:27:43,824
fertilizer.
The Jefferson was one of the first 

600
00:27:45,391 --> 00:27:46,224
presidents to bring the lobster into the
White House because it was seen as 

601
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,930
servants food.
When did it switch Jefferson?

602
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,093
So when he started doing that,
that's when people realized it was so 

603
00:27:54,781 --> 00:27:57,500
delicious.
Lobster socially will be,

604
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,930
if we changed the whole thing,
the lobsters could get a job is insane.

605
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:03,840
That lobster spaghetti that's uh,
that's off the charts,

606
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:04,703
you know,
so the child labor laws were in stored 

607
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:12,030
primarily because of the kids that used 
to work in an oyster.

608
00:28:12,031 --> 00:28:13,500
Shucking plants.
Really?

609
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:14,363
Yeah.
Yeah.

610
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,080
We had a,
one of our best friend,

611
00:28:16,081 --> 00:28:18,930
if not our best friend,
passed away like six months ago.

612
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:19,764
John Bill,
he was a great chucker you helped us at 

613
00:28:22,051 --> 00:28:24,540
the Barbara.
He was like deep into sustainability and

614
00:28:24,541 --> 00:28:25,374
history of oysters and everything and he
was like the source for oysters for 

615
00:28:28,531 --> 00:28:29,160
everything.

616
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,860
He wrote a beautiful book.
I will send you a copy.

617
00:28:31,861 --> 00:28:32,694
It's an incredible book.
There are good food for vegans to 

618
00:28:34,561 --> 00:28:37,230
consider too because there are more 
primitive than most plants.

619
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:38,370
Yeah.
Know.

620
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:39,203
Smallest.
John used to call them ocean cupcakes 

621
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,570
are delicious.
It's a great source of protein,

622
00:28:45,571 --> 00:28:47,780
but it's also they don't have any nerve 
endings.

623
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,400
They're not feeling any sea vegetable.
Yeah.

624
00:28:50,401 --> 00:28:53,460
It basically is.
We have an issue or some people,

625
00:28:53,461 --> 00:28:54,294
not myself,
but some people have an issue with 

626
00:28:54,961 --> 00:28:58,140
things that are capable of moving for 
whatever reason,

627
00:28:58,141 --> 00:28:58,974
we just decided that don't eat that,
but if you want to talk about something 

628
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:02,364
sustainable like mollusks and seafood 
and I mean they can be commercially 

629
00:29:05,701 --> 00:29:06,511
farmed.
They,

630
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:07,344
they actually do have a positive impact 
as you're describing on the environment 

631
00:29:11,311 --> 00:29:13,490
and credible source of protein as well.
Yeah.

632
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,493
Yeah,
and really owned her complete source of 

633
00:29:15,871 --> 00:29:16,620
protein.

634
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:20,700
Not like a very bioavailable source,
unlike a lot of vegetable proteins.

635
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:24,190
So maybe we should do a protein powder 
out of dried oysters.

636
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,320
Just moisture,
protein bro.

637
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:32,610
I mean a lot of people are eating 
cricket protein.

638
00:29:32,611 --> 00:29:36,620
If you guys ever serve any insect dishes
really well.

639
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:37,463
One of the things,
I got a letter last week that someone 

640
00:29:39,031 --> 00:29:44,031
found bug in their salad in there.
I know sometimes the people are a bit.

641
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:46,043
They want the cake and they went to eat 
it too because they people want organic 

642
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:51,220
and we support that.
We love that,

643
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:55,600
but yeah,
organic.

644
00:29:55,601 --> 00:29:57,940
There's no pesticides,
so that's okay.

645
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:58,853
The bugs aren't bad.
It's like the idea of bugs being like 

646
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:02,800
roaches are bad.
Okay.

647
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,930
Most other bugs are not that big of a 
deal.

648
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,220
It's like quite,
you know,

649
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,410
if we're serving,
we're serving 100 people a day and maybe

650
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,860
that arguably being 40 solid,
you know,

651
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:15,070
some kind of crazy work to really look 
at both sides of each leaf.

652
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,920
We try our best,
you know,

653
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:19,780
but you know,
one at one will get past us every year.

654
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:21,640
I think you're better off the people 
that,

655
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:24,580
that are freaking out about bugs.
You don't want them coming in there.

656
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:28,120
Just let them just give them their money
back and get the fuck out of here.

657
00:30:28,121 --> 00:30:30,090
Yeah,
I agree with that policy.

658
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:33,390
But when I was in Mexico,
they uh,

659
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:38,430
we checked into this resort and they had
a bowl of fried crickets in the hotel.

660
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,340
Like they had some sort of a flavor to 
them.

661
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:43,550
They added some flavor to.
Yeah.

662
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,413
Rene Redzepi and noma.
Arguably one of the world's best 

663
00:30:46,871 --> 00:30:49,450
restaurants is obsessed with serving 
ads.

664
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:52,180
Really loves them.
Lemony fresh.

665
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,191
I don't know.
I think that,

666
00:30:53,191 --> 00:30:55,180
I think they're crunchy.
They're delicious.

667
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:56,260
Uh,
you know,

668
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:58,520
he thinks they're fine,
you know,

669
00:30:58,570 --> 00:30:59,403
of course,
and he's doing this wonderful nordic 

670
00:31:01,031 --> 00:31:01,864
cuisine and there's ants and vegetables 
and they foraged mushrooms and there's 

671
00:31:08,171 --> 00:31:08,930
also ad.

672
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:13,120
So why not forge those two and it's a 
homework they do for the rest of us,

673
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,210
you know,
it starts there,

674
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,430
they're doing the right thing,
you know,

675
00:31:15,431 --> 00:31:17,650
people pay a lot of money,
flight there to go eat there,

676
00:31:17,651 --> 00:31:18,484
but you know,
he's doing some good legwork and how to 

677
00:31:21,071 --> 00:31:22,570
prepare them,
how to raise them,

678
00:31:22,571 --> 00:31:23,404
how to,
you know,

679
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:25,390
I'm not saying it's food is based on 
that,

680
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:29,170
but I'm happy that somebody did that 
part of the research and he'll bring the

681
00:31:29,171 --> 00:31:30,280
point up and that'll,
you know,

682
00:31:30,281 --> 00:31:35,281
ultimately by Osmosis,
other younger chefs will try to do that.

683
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,960
I know will tell you.
It'll normalize it a little bit more.

684
00:31:37,961 --> 00:31:41,920
So expect aunt at Nordic restaurants.
Interesting.

685
00:31:41,921 --> 00:31:43,690
So this is the new trend.
Get ahead.

686
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:45,940
Have you heard them?
Los Angeles.

687
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,610
I know you trendy fox are out there 
thinking about what's coming.

688
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:52,870
I'm crickets or a weird one.

689
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:55,180
Like cricket seemed to be like 
universally accepted.

690
00:31:55,181 --> 00:31:57,910
Like cricket protein,
protein bars.

691
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:01,750
You don't see too many other insects 
being like commercially harvested.

692
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:03,510
David and I were in New York,
uh,

693
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,593
for Anthony's a memory thing,
memorial thing and we walked in the 

694
00:32:08,081 --> 00:32:10,960
bowery and you know,
middle of the afternoon,

695
00:32:10,961 --> 00:32:11,651
Hudson,
oh,

696
00:32:11,651 --> 00:32:14,680
this is a good meal and there's like a 
little store,

697
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,340
no refrigeration and there's buckets of 
clams and you know,

698
00:32:18,341 --> 00:32:19,174
like Mesh bags,
like you put onions in his big mesh bag 

699
00:32:21,641 --> 00:32:25,360
in the bin and it's full of giant bull 
frogs.

700
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:28,650
Like looking up at it like a hundred 
little bullfrog,

701
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:31,840
but like it's like oranges and a box,
like one,

702
00:32:31,841 --> 00:32:32,201
two,
three,

703
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:34,290
four,
five live in their little lies.

704
00:32:34,291 --> 00:32:36,760
Just looking up like this.
And I was like,

705
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:39,470
sure we have frogs in the book,
but that was.

706
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:40,040
So hang on,

707
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,690
fred and I had been cooking for years,
like,

708
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,000
you know,
25 years arguably if not more,

709
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:48,170
I've probably assessed were processed or
a French cookie.

710
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:49,720
Okay.
So of course we can.

711
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:51,920
We just look at the frogs.
We don't say anything to each other.

712
00:32:51,921 --> 00:32:54,650
We keep on walking and I go,
hang on a sec,

713
00:32:54,651 --> 00:32:55,760
fred,
walk me through.

714
00:32:55,761 --> 00:32:58,490
This goes,
how exactly does this work?

715
00:32:58,491 --> 00:33:00,920
I know how to do a rabbit.
I know how to do a hair.

716
00:33:00,921 --> 00:33:03,170
I know how to do a duck.
I know how to do any fish.

717
00:33:03,171 --> 00:33:04,550
Any seafood.
Lobster.

718
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,790
Case of frog in the kitchen.
What's your first move right now?

719
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:10,220
What's their first move?
So we take the live frog.

720
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:11,054
Do I put it on the cutting board?
Do I hack its legs off and what do I do 

721
00:33:14,541 --> 00:33:17,510
with the 60 percent remaining of the 
frog?

722
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:20,960
Yeah.
Is it,

723
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:23,720
is it ground?
Does it end up in dumplings?

724
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,060
Where's that other part of the frog 
going?

725
00:33:26,061 --> 00:33:27,650
Is it soup?
Is it broth?

726
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,780
Know that's an amphibian.
It was fascinating.

727
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,280
Did you experiment?
No,

728
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,493
I'm mortified.
And after that we went to Tony's 

729
00:33:37,251 --> 00:33:38,084
memorial.
It was a Chinese restaurant and I was 

730
00:33:39,981 --> 00:33:40,814
just like,
I couldn't eat because by default 

731
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,740
everything had like frog in it in my 
head.

732
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:49,450
So you were freaking out just because 
they were alive staring up at you know,

733
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,620
because I know that the legs are 
delicious.

734
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,030
I know that,
you know,

735
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:53,923
if I chop the legs off and I peel the 
skin and I dredge them in flour and I 

736
00:33:56,691 --> 00:33:59,420
fry them and I served them with garlic 
cream,

737
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,060
that they're delicious.
There's delicious chicken wings.

738
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:07,330
What I'm worried about is the frog is so
big and you know,

739
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:11,510
the discarded part of the frog is a size
of a softball.

740
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,880
Right.
So yeah.

741
00:34:12,881 --> 00:34:16,940
It's like eating the stem of the apple 
and leaving the apple in cooking.

742
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:20,060
We don't throw stuff out.
Right,

743
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:21,493
right.
So I want to know what happens to that 

744
00:34:23,691 --> 00:34:28,100
part in Chinese cookery or French 
cookery?

745
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:28,920
Well,

746
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,760
the place that you guys were at was a 
Chinese market.

747
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:34,010
Yeah,
it was one of those hole in the door,

748
00:34:34,011 --> 00:34:38,600
kind of like supplier and it was like we
got it.

749
00:34:38,601 --> 00:34:40,970
There were claims that were wink Perry 
winkles.

750
00:34:40,971 --> 00:34:45,440
There were like all like Google never 
processed trogs in my career.

751
00:34:45,441 --> 00:34:46,251
Really,
you know,

752
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:47,084
when I've gotten fresh frogs,
I was working in France and it was just 

753
00:34:48,951 --> 00:34:50,960
the frog's legs and a button in a 
basket.

754
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:55,060
But even then I would wonder in France,
where does that other part go?

755
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,233
I know this is a very disturbing,
what seems like there's got to be an 

756
00:34:59,301 --> 00:35:00,500
answer to this.
Maybe.

757
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:02,450
I don't know.
It would be the people that I would call

758
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:05,890
one ton stuffing.
Right?

759
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:09,260
Sort of boiled and I'm hoping they're 
discarded.

760
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,650
I just googled it and the video is a 
graphic.

761
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:15,470
Let it go.
Let it roll.

762
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:17,180
I can't,
I'm not going to put it up on Youtube.

763
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,023
Okay.
We'll put it up.

764
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,160
Put it up for us so we can see it.
Here we go.

765
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,120
Okay.
Oh No.

766
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:27,050
They don't even bother killing them 
first.

767
00:35:27,051 --> 00:35:30,490
They just do it on the fly.
So the legs off off.

768
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:34,730
That's exactly how I pursue ease.
Okay.

769
00:35:34,731 --> 00:35:38,310
So they squeeze it out once,
cut the head off the.

770
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,400
They squeeze it out like A.
Would you describe that?

771
00:35:41,401 --> 00:35:43,470
Like they're appealing it now.
Right?

772
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,513
So then they squeezed the,
they squeezed the innards out through 

773
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:49,620
the neck cavity.
The last of toothpaste.

774
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,210
Yes.
That's a good way to describe it.

775
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,110
Yeah.
Okay.

776
00:35:52,111 --> 00:35:52,944
So then they take it.
Now it looks like a man because it's 

777
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:58,060
headless.
It's like a headless man that's.

778
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:03,120
It's like one of those you use to draw 
bodies there?

779
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,350
Yeah,
I would,

780
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:05,183
I would.
I would point you put the batteries to 

781
00:36:06,391 --> 00:36:07,224
the hind legs.

782
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,380
Batteries know in like high school.
Oh,

783
00:36:10,381 --> 00:36:12,530
right.
You put the little battery in the back.

784
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,200
Light cigarettes in them.
He's chopping them up.

785
00:36:16,201 --> 00:36:20,610
It seems like he's leaving the bones on.
Is that what he's doing?

786
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:21,751
Yeah.
Okay.

787
00:36:21,751 --> 00:36:22,584
So you know what,
it's really great that we're watching 

788
00:36:23,941 --> 00:36:26,610
this because I'm a lot less horrified by
the whole prospect of it.

789
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:29,680
So he's just hacking it up.
Bones intact and then.

790
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:30,573
And chucking it into a basket so it 
doesn't look like they're missing much 

791
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:35,693
other than the guts.
So it seems like the energy and then 

792
00:36:37,801 --> 00:36:40,100
they seem to be boiling all that stuff 
and okay.

793
00:36:40,101 --> 00:36:40,934
So they put it in a soup with the bones 
and tact and you just sort of 

794
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,510
highlighted that it.
Yeah.

795
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:45,563
It's funny.
If I had to make a dish with data and 

796
00:36:46,471 --> 00:36:49,710
make the super daily lives inside the 
water lilies,

797
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:53,160
I mean with lily pad soup with frog.

798
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,293
What is.
Have you ever tried anything with no 

799
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:58,110
leaves?
Look like lily pads,

800
00:36:58,111 --> 00:36:59,910
right?
Those are hot right now and cooking.

801
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:00,803
Do you guys try to do that,
like add some of the ingredients of the 

802
00:37:03,301 --> 00:37:06,660
native environments of the tricks to 
cooking?

803
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:07,703
What are the best tricks or cooking?
When you chef told me this a long time 

804
00:37:10,111 --> 00:37:11,070
ago in France,
he goes,

805
00:37:11,071 --> 00:37:12,390
well,
chef,

806
00:37:12,391 --> 00:37:15,540
what should I cook with a lamb with?
He goes cheesy.

807
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,433
What would it eat if you had a land?
What would be growing around it and it 

808
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,700
automatically.
You just scroll down.

809
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:23,160
If I had a lamb and a p,
an acre of land,

810
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,620
what would be around it?
There would be turnips,

811
00:37:25,621 --> 00:37:27,660
there would be carrots and onions.
There will be apples,

812
00:37:27,661 --> 00:37:29,070
there'll be pairs,
there will be time,

813
00:37:29,071 --> 00:37:30,690
there will be basil,
there would be garlic,

814
00:37:30,691 --> 00:37:32,050
there would be.
So just.

815
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:35,220
There you go.
Traditional idealic environment.

816
00:37:35,221 --> 00:37:36,054
Yeah.
The problem is is when you have lobster 

817
00:37:37,831 --> 00:37:39,300
and you cook it with mangoes,
right?

818
00:37:39,301 --> 00:37:43,110
We're lobster is where law comes from.
There's no mangoes,

819
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,990
so the recipe doesn't make sense.
Might be delicious,

820
00:37:45,991 --> 00:37:47,760
but it's dumb.
But butter,

821
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,980
lobster and butter,
they go together.

822
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:50,940
Lobster,
butter,

823
00:37:50,941 --> 00:37:53,190
potatoes.
What else grows their onions?

824
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:56,310
A Prince Edward Island.
Okay.

825
00:37:56,311 --> 00:38:00,780
Small island in the Gulf.
One of the provinces of Canada.

826
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,860
We have cows.
So you'd say those and lobster.

827
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:06,830
Three resources.
Not the.

828
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,180
Not the actual environment.
A rabbit.

829
00:38:09,181 --> 00:38:11,370
If you have a rabbit in your backyard or
you know,

830
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,830
in the line of sight.
Right.

831
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:14,980
I get what can you see there?
Oh,

832
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,190
rabbit with apples and carrots.
Makes Sense.

833
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,320
That makes sense.
Yeah.

834
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,240
But.
But what if lobster and mango is fucking

835
00:38:21,241 --> 00:38:22,290
delicious?
Yeah.

836
00:38:22,291 --> 00:38:22,940
But then,
uh,

837
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,450
you know,
for other people to do,

838
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:27,360
we have our principals academically 
incorrect.

839
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:28,903
Incorrect.
That's fascinating.

840
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:31,320
One of my favorite pizzas.
Don't get disgusted at me.

841
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:34,090
Don't hate me.
Pineapple and Ancho.

842
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,150
Pineapple and anchovy.
That's right.

843
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:38,830
Pineapple and ham and pineapple and 
anchovy.

844
00:38:38,831 --> 00:38:41,110
It's God damn delicious.
I fucking love it.

845
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:42,730
I don't care what you say.
Who does that though?

846
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,920
You'd invented that.
I might have.

847
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:47,660
That's good.
Now I want to try it.

848
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:48,523
I want to try frog soup with lily pads 
and pineapple and anchovy pizza with 

849
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:53,764
both.
Part with the pineapple and hard with 

850
00:38:55,031 --> 00:38:56,950
the anchovy.
Do you want to write a book?

851
00:38:56,951 --> 00:39:00,340
Three with us,
with Joe.

852
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:04,390
I'm good at elk steaks and I know how to
order pineapple and anchovy pizza.

853
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:05,283
I have to say that when they see your 
picture you posted if you're a meat 

854
00:39:08,231 --> 00:39:09,250
cooking.
Not Bad.

855
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:11,620
It's always on point.
Thank you very much.

856
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:12,483
Because there's a lot of hunters that 
post up pictures of their dinner and 

857
00:39:17,741 --> 00:39:21,010
it's not because like you can take 
pictures and they'll look beautiful with

858
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,120
like a vanity thing.

859
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:26,020
It's not the quality of the picture but 
the food is a little bit.

860
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,150
Yeah.
Some hunters don't know how to cook.

861
00:39:28,151 --> 00:39:31,300
We have a lot of hunters in Quebec and 
sometimes you know the hunter will bring

862
00:39:31,301 --> 00:39:32,134
by the.
Because I shot this beautiful Mousse 

863
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,253
David at wayside 2000 pounds or 1500 
pounds and he shows me a picture on his 

864
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:43,921
phone and then he brings me a jar of the
spaghetti sauce he made out of the Moose

865
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,233
after like really like you.
You shot them majestic Moose and the 

866
00:39:50,531 --> 00:39:53,560
forest and you made spaghetti sauce with
it.

867
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:56,560
Like put Kiwi and then because it 
tenderizes the meat.

868
00:39:58,570 --> 00:39:59,403
Well listen,
spaghetti sauce with ground moves is 

869
00:40:01,481 --> 00:40:03,220
delicious.
I'll give you a tip.

870
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:07,330
You gotta have you gotta have a high eat
everything.

871
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,530
I eat the whole thing,
right?

872
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:09,820
I mean I,
I've,

873
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:11,013
I know how to make the roasts and I use 
the ground for a bunch of different 

874
00:40:14,261 --> 00:40:19,261
things and I just think that if you,
if you do it properly or if you,

875
00:40:20,161 --> 00:40:20,994
if you want to handle it properly,
you've really got to read up on how to 

876
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:27,790
cook wild game as opposed to how to cook
anything else.

877
00:40:27,791 --> 00:40:31,060
There's a very little fat content.
It's a tricky kind of meat to cook.

878
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:34,900
There's a tool,
it's called a lapdog in French.

879
00:40:34,901 --> 00:40:35,734
It's like a big needle with a swivel tip
and what you do is you cut long strips 

880
00:40:40,091 --> 00:40:42,260
of fat and you poke him through the 
meat,

881
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:45,130
abject it.
Yet you don't inject,

882
00:40:45,131 --> 00:40:46,480
you put like,
like writing it,

883
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:50,060
threading your piece of meat,
like the loins are the fat,

884
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:51,820
the back straps,
it's,

885
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,110
it tends to be leaner.

886
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,393
So you put long strips of pork fat 
inside and you cook it slowly enough 

887
00:40:57,821 --> 00:40:58,654
that the pork fat will melt inside.
So in every bite you'll have a little 

888
00:41:01,811 --> 00:41:04,900
bit of fat to neat saying it's an old 
French cooking treg yeah,

889
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:05,743
that sounds sensational.
Or what we do actually for the wild 

890
00:41:09,521 --> 00:41:11,260
rabbit,
which is extremely dry,

891
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:12,543
we'll put a veal foot with the skin,
so that'll give up the Collagen and 

892
00:41:18,341 --> 00:41:20,140
we'll put the slice of pork belly with 
it.

893
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,033
They'll give up the fat.
When are you guys going back to 

894
00:41:22,631 --> 00:41:24,190
Montreal?
Tomorrow.

895
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:25,320
Tomorrow?
Yeah.

896
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:27,850
I can't give you meat,
right?

897
00:41:27,851 --> 00:41:28,481
It wouldn't.
No,

898
00:41:28,481 --> 00:41:29,500
it couldn't get through.
The border.

899
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:32,500
Wouldn't work this way.
The other way works.

900
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:34,100
Yes,
it works if you

901
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:35,890
hunted and bringing it through.
I brought.

902
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:38,900
I brought me back,
but a damn.

903
00:41:38,901 --> 00:41:41,170
I'd like to give you guys something.
See what you do with it.

904
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:45,500
It's a lot of things.
It's our favorite meat,

905
00:41:45,501 --> 00:41:48,710
but you know,
it would be sooner.

906
00:41:48,711 --> 00:41:53,180
Be caught with bricks of hashish then.
Then Venison as restaurant owners,

907
00:41:53,181 --> 00:41:53,890
you know,
like,

908
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:54,800
like you,
we'd been.

909
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:59,900
You cannot have any wild game in your 
restaurant.

910
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:01,880
Even if it's just for your own personal 
consumption,

911
00:42:01,881 --> 00:42:06,881
not really started yet into two is a 
problem and never in Quebec if caviar,

912
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,840
you know,
we have a lot of sturgeon in the Gulf of

913
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,030
St Lawrence that laws are written like 
lights out,

914
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:11,864
ridiculous.
If you get caught with like a gram of 

915
00:42:14,271 --> 00:42:16,310
caviar and your boat,
you don't have a license,

916
00:42:16,311 --> 00:42:20,990
so freeze your bank accounts and sees 
your house kind of thing and we'd go and

917
00:42:20,991 --> 00:42:22,130
we'd go south quick.

918
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:23,263
What is the concern?
Is it such a commercial market for 

919
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:26,990
sturgeon caviar?
Is that what it is?

920
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:28,070
Yeah,
exactly.

921
00:42:28,071 --> 00:42:28,761
Yeah.
Wow.

922
00:42:28,761 --> 00:42:32,060
So people will just go that far out of 
their way to get caviar that they had to

923
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,133
just make these.
It's like a fish right now is worthless 

924
00:42:34,821 --> 00:42:36,440
if you can't use the caviar.
Right.

925
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,480
We're allowed that.
There's a fishery for them.

926
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:43,190
They fished sturgeon in the Gulf of St 
Lawrence.

927
00:42:43,191 --> 00:42:44,990
When they catch them,
they have to gut them.

928
00:42:44,991 --> 00:42:45,824
They have to remove every egg and dump 
the eggs into the water that they're 

929
00:42:48,711 --> 00:42:52,760
allowed to bring the meat back,
to smoke it and salt it and to sell it.

930
00:42:52,761 --> 00:42:57,761
There is a commercial commercial wild 
fishery for a sturgeon meat,

931
00:42:57,890 --> 00:42:58,723
but the.
So ultimately you just put a price tag 

932
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:02,990
on the fish.
Let's say it's worth 200 bucks,

933
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:06,500
but all of a sudden if you're allowed to
harvest the eggs and the fish,

934
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:07,363
15 grand.

935
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:08,373
Yeah,
it would just be,

936
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:09,763
yeah,
because they produce a more monolithic 

937
00:43:10,971 --> 00:43:11,804
amount of eggs.
What's crazy is now you're making it 

938
00:43:13,611 --> 00:43:16,790
useless because you're throwing it away.
Something that's incredibly valuable and

939
00:43:16,791 --> 00:43:18,860
delicious.
The quotas are very small though.

940
00:43:18,861 --> 00:43:19,694
Let's say if you had a sturgeon license,
I imagine you're allowed five or six or 

941
00:43:22,971 --> 00:43:24,480
something like that.
And uh,

942
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:29,500
the first nations like Mohawks,
the heroes have the right to fish.

943
00:43:30,171 --> 00:43:31,004
You know,
we've been on boats where a guy was 

944
00:43:32,661 --> 00:43:33,201
fishing,
you know,

945
00:43:33,201 --> 00:43:37,310
he showed us the traditional technique 
and it's not the sports fishing like the

946
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:38,000
soup,
they,

947
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,833
this,
they like,

948
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:41,840
they love it.
It's great fish in themselves.

949
00:43:41,841 --> 00:43:42,674
They the eggs and make soup.
They put the eggs in it they like or 

950
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:49,100
they catch sergeant 20 minutes from Joe 
Beef right there downtown.

951
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:52,010
It's a dinosaur.
It would up with a spear.

952
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:55,010
Wow.
It's a crazy animal.

953
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,700
And when you see them in the water,
yeah.

954
00:43:56,701 --> 00:43:59,300
Do you see the scales on them?
So bizarre that I mean,

955
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:02,270
how they're from what 100 million years 
ago to start.

956
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:04,400
Once they look like dinosaurs,
they really do.

957
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:05,773
And the guys that we know that the 
system is quite the character is an 

958
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:10,010
interesting guy.
He's a,

959
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:10,873
he's a Mohawk and he told us that the 
biologist but underwater cameras there 

960
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:15,763
to look,
keep track of the fish and they said 

961
00:44:17,181 --> 00:44:19,790
they see like 16 layers of sturgeon 
swimming,

962
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:22,880
one at the top of the other.
He said I could walk on the fish.

963
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,920
You know,
there's that many.

964
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:26,250
Yeah,
there's a ton.

965
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,810
Wow.
That's.

966
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:28,641
But again,
you know,

967
00:44:28,641 --> 00:44:29,474
the people don't really.
We even struggled with it at the 

968
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:31,733
restaurant.
For me to sell a plate of smoked 

969
00:44:34,261 --> 00:44:36,750
sturgeon,
tough sell,

970
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:40,620
you know,
sooner sell other things than that.

971
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,570
Uh,
people aren't interested.

972
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:45,440
I think it's a tough sell as a fish.
Let's say as a,

973
00:44:45,441 --> 00:44:48,360
as a 200 gram or four ounce piece of 
fish thing.

974
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:52,020
That is so crazy.
Is that the same river?

975
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:54,970
That's probably Columbia river sturgeon.
That looks like frasier.

976
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:56,100
Yeah.
Fraser,

977
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:58,350
NBC.
Look at the size of that thing.

978
00:44:58,351 --> 00:45:02,790
That is so ancient looking.
It looks like it shouldn't be here.

979
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,700
Yeah,
it's a fish that's a bit muddy.

980
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:09,180
Do sometimes depending on where it's 
caught and everything.

981
00:45:09,181 --> 00:45:10,910
So how do you,
uh,

982
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:11,813
how do you handle it?
Like if you were going to cook one of 

983
00:45:13,111 --> 00:45:14,830
those,
we make Jamaican patties.

984
00:45:15,850 --> 00:45:18,600
Fuck,
we did an old French cookery.

985
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:21,210
Uh,
one of the ways to cook sturgeon is,

986
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,073
you know,
ultimately you apply cooking a piece of 

987
00:45:23,791 --> 00:45:27,300
sturgeon loin as you would a piece of 
veal loin of pork loin.

988
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:30,360
A meat juice even is acceptable,
you know,

989
00:45:30,361 --> 00:45:32,130
roasted carrots,
roasted onions,

990
00:45:32,131 --> 00:45:37,131
roasted to salary,
roast the storage in and bake bacon,

991
00:45:37,291 --> 00:45:38,760
mushroom red wine,
like Fred said.

992
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:40,103
So you treat the sturgeon as you would 
meet is possibly the best way to treat 

993
00:45:44,701 --> 00:45:47,250
it as you would.
Fish is not the best.

994
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,353
You know,
people got to expect we were overly 

995
00:45:51,061 --> 00:45:53,350
fortunate to have,
you know,

996
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:54,630
300 gram,
you know,

997
00:45:54,631 --> 00:45:59,580
like a pound of fish,
seared in a pan and served with a little

998
00:45:59,581 --> 00:46:01,530
sauce was common thing.
Right.

999
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:06,690
But it's not the right thing to do if we
want to keep things in the water,

1000
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,370
you know,
for kids or whatever.

1001
00:46:08,371 --> 00:46:12,540
So people got used to this like a piece 
of fish that they like,

1002
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,810
nothing that you can eat for like an 
hour and a half because you have so much

1003
00:46:15,811 --> 00:46:19,290
of it then that's the standard.
But at fish lake sturgeon is great.

1004
00:46:19,291 --> 00:46:21,910
If you have a little bit then the sauce,
like David Mate says,

1005
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,033
talks about over like a buttery mashed 
potatoes or like with like an egg 

1006
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:28,650
noodles or something like that.

1007
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:29,933
It's a great way to do it.
Then it's a great way to look at fish 

1008
00:46:31,441 --> 00:46:34,590
were like,
you need actually 75 grams of protein,

1009
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:37,950
not like 500.
What is the,

1010
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,040
is there a comparison that you can make 
in terms of what it tastes like?

1011
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:45,720
Yeah,
I'm [inaudible] a little bit,

1012
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:50,780
I guess somewhat braised a braised veal 
color.

1013
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:51,600
Uh,
what'd you say?

1014
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,870
Blanquette?
I'd do a larger piece of stew,

1015
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:55,733
like not a small two inch block of Stew,
but let's say a bigger piece of stew 

1016
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,630
with a chunk of seaweed in it,
you know?

1017
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,820
Yeah,
it's neat.

1018
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:06,390
It's neat.
It sounds now I'm hungry for it.

1019
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:08,920
We do like a fred.
Fred got the,

1020
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:10,320
made the God,
the big nuggets.

1021
00:47:10,321 --> 00:47:10,951
Molds,
you know,

1022
00:47:10,951 --> 00:47:11,784
because you know,
the mcnuggets have this like not there 

1023
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:18,870
was like four or five different sizes.
Fred made the mold and the first book I,

1024
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:19,713
they precisely exactly like the 
Mcdonald's mcnuggets and we used to do 

1025
00:47:22,951 --> 00:47:27,180
sturgeon mcnuggets or eel eel mcnuggets.
Same fishery,

1026
00:47:27,181 --> 00:47:28,860
right?
We have deals where we get sturgeon.

1027
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:30,293
Uh,

1028
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:33,160
it was kind of a ton of them at the 
restaurant.

1029
00:47:33,161 --> 00:47:35,080
It would literally,
you'd be a job for and you'd get on your

1030
00:47:35,081 --> 00:47:35,914
plate what looked to be like six 
mcnuggets with the sauce and the Little 

1031
00:47:38,501 --> 00:47:39,970
Paper Cup on the side.
People like,

1032
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:43,020
what the hell is this?
I says,

1033
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:46,510
Sergeant Nuggets.
People is a weird one.

1034
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:49,270
When I used to go fishing,
a lot of people would catch eels,

1035
00:47:49,271 --> 00:47:50,420
they'd be upset,
like,

1036
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:54,550
and then I would go to buy Sushi later 
on in life and uh,

1037
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:57,940
there'd be eel Sushi and I'd be like,
what the fuck is going on different?

1038
00:47:57,970 --> 00:48:01,080
A Wolf Wolf Eel.
It's a different fence.

1039
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:03,970
It's not,
it's not a true isla in Sushi.

1040
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:04,601
Yeah,
correct.

1041
00:48:04,601 --> 00:48:06,390
Yeah.
Even like the real deal,

1042
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,190
I'm,
I can eat bits of it,

1043
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:10,323
but if we were to take a kneel eel and 
dislike first you have to put a nail in 

1044
00:48:13,721 --> 00:48:14,554
his head and the nail and it's Dale and 
like skin it and cut its head off and 

1045
00:48:18,581 --> 00:48:21,880
peel it and put it in a cast iron pan 
with butter.

1046
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:26,280
And it's still moving like a snake and 
the smell of it,

1047
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,680
it makes you choke,
you know,

1048
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:29,523
we had like four.
We had a little truck pond at Joe beef 

1049
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:32,470
that I built,
you know,

1050
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:37,590
really that and it,
it was a bad experience because we had a

1051
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,750
refrigerator thing that makes the water 
cold,

1052
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:41,740
you know,
a cooler.

1053
00:48:41,741 --> 00:48:44,050
And we had a pump.
Every time it rained,

1054
00:48:44,051 --> 00:48:47,860
it would turn the breaker off and now 
the fish like drowned,

1055
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:49,000
drowned,
no oxygen.

1056
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:49,863
Martin Picard gave us some meals and we 
found him the next day in the parking 

1057
00:48:52,781 --> 00:48:53,614
lot,
like all the way on the other side of 

1058
00:48:55,361 --> 00:48:58,450
the parking lot and the baseball field 
or the bleachers when shit,

1059
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:03,550
they're cooking it and it's swimming at 
a head and no skin at this point.

1060
00:49:03,551 --> 00:49:04,810
This is a grill.
What does it say?

1061
00:49:04,811 --> 00:49:09,220
It say shocking clip of cooking and eel 
alive in Seoul.

1062
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:13,210
Nobody's got that.
That els beheaded and skinned beheaded.

1063
00:49:13,211 --> 00:49:16,330
Still nervous system is still very 
intact.

1064
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,650
What is,
what are those things?

1065
00:49:17,651 --> 00:49:19,570
In the bottom there was this legs.
What is.

1066
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,300
That's probably its guts.
Oh God.

1067
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:25,050
Look at that thing bucket,
man.

1068
00:49:25,051 --> 00:49:26,470
That's like,
that's real.

1069
00:49:26,471 --> 00:49:29,020
Stir frying.
I caught one whites in Nova Scotia and a

1070
00:49:29,021 --> 00:49:33,740
hook and line and when I caught it,
the fisherman next to me,

1071
00:49:33,741 --> 00:49:34,060
he said,
oh,

1072
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:37,660
don't reel it in.
So I just held my fishing rod.

1073
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:38,523
I wasn't reading in and the eel real.
That itself up my line to the tip of my 

1074
00:49:43,691 --> 00:49:47,860
fishing rod and started reading down my 
fishing rod towards me.

1075
00:49:47,861 --> 00:49:49,690
I was a kid.
I was horrified.

1076
00:49:49,691 --> 00:49:50,524
Ever since then I've had an issue with 
like I worked in a restaurant in France 

1077
00:49:55,710 --> 00:50:00,710
and diesel and in the fridge right near 
the cook of the hotline,

1078
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:01,564
the cooking line.
There was a wooden box with a 

1079
00:50:03,281 --> 00:50:06,160
cinderblock on it.
It's the first day at work there.

1080
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:11,190
I was helping out on the fish station 
and I hear in French [inaudible] on come

1081
00:50:11,411 --> 00:50:13,540
on the Webinar,
what do you all ordered up?

1082
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:14,920
And then the,
the,

1083
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,950
the,
the fish chef says go in the fridge,

1084
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:22,420
there's a wooden box.
You take the cinder block off it,

1085
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:25,030
you just lift the lid a little bit.
Plunger hand in there,

1086
00:50:25,031 --> 00:50:26,980
grabbing eel and bring it back to me.
I was like,

1087
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:27,943
kidding,
right.

1088
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:31,400
So I literally do that.
Go into the walk in fridge.

1089
00:50:31,401 --> 00:50:34,460
I pulled a wooden box out,
I take the cinder block off the top,

1090
00:50:34,461 --> 00:50:37,730
I lift the hit.
It was just literally,

1091
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,233
you know,
50 eels rising together and it's like 

1092
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:44,920
Indiana Jones,
you know,

1093
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,480
they live with an out of water.
No problem.

1094
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:50,700
Martin Picard at Peter Shaw in his 
restaurant right now.

1095
00:50:50,701 --> 00:50:51,534
What was there last week?
He has a lobster tank right in the 

1096
00:50:55,641 --> 00:50:57,740
doorway.
I think they hang your coats right above

1097
00:50:57,741 --> 00:51:02,540
it and in it there's like eight massive 
eels.

1098
00:51:02,570 --> 00:51:03,403
Then chase them when they come at work 
in the morning they reopened the 

1099
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:07,100
restaurant.
They'll find them like in the cash,

1100
00:51:07,101 --> 00:51:07,934
register it in the coat check.
They have like cinderblocks down now on 

1101
00:51:12,801 --> 00:51:15,740
the top they got a plexi glass top with 
holes in it,

1102
00:51:15,741 --> 00:51:20,300
so it oxygenates and they're like 
literally pinned down in that tank.

1103
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:24,860
But even as you're eating and you just 
see those giant eels in the tank or size

1104
00:51:24,861 --> 00:51:26,870
of your flag here,
it's just horrific.

1105
00:51:26,871 --> 00:51:27,704
You know,
it's the best thing about eels talking 

1106
00:51:29,001 --> 00:51:29,834
about it.

1107
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:33,200
Now.
What about the flavor?

1108
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,470
I like it.
Super smoked,

1109
00:51:36,471 --> 00:51:40,580
super salted down with a good sugary,
salty brine.

1110
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:44,150
You have to cover it like in nuggets 
like we did,

1111
00:51:44,151 --> 00:51:44,984
but like even like laying dead 
restaurant David was talking about if 

1112
00:51:47,241 --> 00:51:51,530
you take a fresh piece of veal and put 
it in a cast iron pan to smoke,

1113
00:51:51,531 --> 00:51:53,030
it does.
It's like mustard gas.

1114
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:54,280
Oh yeah,
yeah,

1115
00:51:54,370 --> 00:51:54,771
yeah,
yeah.

1116
00:51:54,771 --> 00:51:56,360
It's good.
Like it's super.

1117
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,313
I'm a little bit allergic to it.
I guess not all fish but some fish and 

1118
00:52:00,761 --> 00:52:02,600
I,
when I used to work at that restaurant,

1119
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:03,463
we would literally like put a knife 
through his head and into the cutting 

1120
00:52:06,261 --> 00:52:10,250
board and then another knife through its
tail so it would be straight on the,

1121
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:11,143
on the cutting boards.
We pinned down the left side on the 

1122
00:52:12,891 --> 00:52:16,610
right side of the hill.
Then we'd lift the filets skin them,

1123
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:17,683
score them,
and then Pan sear them with artichoke 

1124
00:52:20,931 --> 00:52:21,980
and country ham.

1125
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:27,830
And as I was pants hearing them,
I was breathing in the vapors of searing

1126
00:52:27,831 --> 00:52:30,350
the eel and my,
my lungs would seize,

1127
00:52:31,070 --> 00:52:33,250
you know,
I'd have like kind of like,

1128
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:36,310
it would give me an asthma attack 
somewhat.

1129
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,153
It was wild.
Now it's just a popular dish in France 

1130
00:52:39,651 --> 00:52:41,720
because of necessity,
because of a lack of,

1131
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:43,193
a lot of,
a lot of old French cooking would be 

1132
00:52:45,201 --> 00:52:47,510
based on what you had in your 
neighborhood.

1133
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:48,440
Uh,
you know,

1134
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:52,070
French cooking was very different pre 
federal express,

1135
00:52:52,071 --> 00:52:54,680
pre roads,
you know,

1136
00:52:54,681 --> 00:52:59,681
so eels in French cooking would come 
from the Bordeaux region ultimately,

1137
00:53:00,411 --> 00:53:03,200
and you know,
it would be like a donkey,

1138
00:53:03,201 --> 00:53:06,470
so it would be an eel stu in red wine of
course,

1139
00:53:06,471 --> 00:53:07,281
carrot,
onion,

1140
00:53:07,281 --> 00:53:09,110
celery.
Exactly like a beef stew.

1141
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:10,513
And I think also the thing about it is 
that it's a dish that you wouldn't make 

1142
00:53:13,371 --> 00:53:14,510
at home,
you know,

1143
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:16,630
so people would go,
lay on d,

1144
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:20,450
Let's go need to heal because that's 
what there was.

1145
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:24,050
You don't want to have the cinderblock 
plexiglass case in your house.

1146
00:53:24,051 --> 00:53:26,310
And then the imagine your house with 
your,

1147
00:53:26,311 --> 00:53:30,080
your kids are my kids land praise,
there's Bordeaux,

1148
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:31,230
there's some,
you know,

1149
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:35,640
some of the famous iconic dishes of 
Bordeaux is lamb praise.

1150
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:38,160
This is like an animal from Dune,
you know,

1151
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:39,143
it's like a big hole with teeth.
They're the ones that cling to the 

1152
00:53:40,831 --> 00:53:42,090
bottom of sharks.
Correct,

1153
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:43,350
no,
that's a remora.

1154
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,160
Oh,
okay.

1155
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,020
The land prey is a problem actually.
Now,

1156
00:53:46,021 --> 00:53:46,854
even in America,
they're coming up in some rivers and 

1157
00:53:48,361 --> 00:53:52,200
they attached themselves to fish with 
their suction cup head.

1158
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:56,140
They're just horrific animal suction cup
head too.

1159
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,030
If it's like,
dude,

1160
00:53:57,031 --> 00:53:58,800
it's like that alimony dude look like 
that.

1161
00:53:58,801 --> 00:54:00,660
Yeah.
What do they taste like?

1162
00:54:01,590 --> 00:54:05,880
Probably the crappy like eel.
We did a dinner Shittier Isla.

1163
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:06,953
We did a dinner for Tony when he did his
second book I think at Liverpool House 

1164
00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:14,250
and I was,
we were much younger and I was like,

1165
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,360
oh,
let's buy some like daring food,

1166
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:17,223
you know,
Tony Board endless by something like 

1167
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:19,620
fucked up.

1168
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:24,240
So I ordered like two of those eel and I
try to make soup.

1169
00:54:24,241 --> 00:54:26,190
Widowhood had tried to make everything 
and again,

1170
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:27,760
you know,
the classic Joe,

1171
00:54:27,770 --> 00:54:30,300
the best thing to do it is to put it in 
the garbage.

1172
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:32,370
You are,
you make stock,

1173
00:54:32,371 --> 00:54:33,930
you reduce it.
The nutro it away.

1174
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:37,470
I'm sure there's a recipe that's good 
and I'm sure in,

1175
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:38,373
in case of apocalypse after the winter 
succeeds will fish for that and we'll 

1176
00:54:43,741 --> 00:54:44,970
eat it.
But until then,

1177
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:45,953
I'm,
I'm,

1178
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:48,870
I'm okay with like cutting my big MACs 
in half,

1179
00:54:48,871 --> 00:54:49,704
so they last for two days.
He was a cool company that I've been 

1180
00:54:51,481 --> 00:54:54,110
following a company online I think on 
twitter,

1181
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:56,610
instagram.
It's called American who Nagi.

1182
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:57,953
They're up in the Atlantic,
northeast area I think in Maine or 

1183
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:03,810
Massachusetts somewhere or they have 
some really.

1184
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:04,673
They're raising eels,
I think releasing them into the nature 

1185
00:55:07,081 --> 00:55:07,914
and they're selling eels commercially.
They looks again like horrific work 

1186
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:14,230
raising them and releasing them in the 
field.

1187
00:55:15,170 --> 00:55:16,003
Who is there like some sort of a 
environmental benefit of having the 

1188
00:55:18,991 --> 00:55:19,824
eels?
Is it staying about the lobster and put 

1189
00:55:21,991 --> 00:55:25,020
it away in a freshwater river?
There are weird animal.

1190
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:25,591
Right?
Again,

1191
00:55:25,591 --> 00:55:28,200
loosely based.
My facts are old reading,

1192
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:34,020
but from what I recall,
eels are cool because they all the eels

1193
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:40,280
every year.
Go back to the Sargasso Sea.

1194
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:45,090
Is it true that that's what I remember.
Was that folklore,

1195
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:48,420
you think?
Filtration,

1196
00:55:49,130 --> 00:55:50,050
volume?
Yeah.

1197
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:50,580
Yeah,
yeah.

1198
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:51,810
Oysters,
filter emails.

1199
00:55:53,310 --> 00:55:56,730
So they all go back to this one area 
though.

1200
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:01,050
Supposedly there's a breeding area for 
them called the Sargasso Sea.

1201
00:56:01,110 --> 00:56:01,943
Great place for swimming.
And where's the Sargasso sea is kind of 

1202
00:56:06,451 --> 00:56:08,460
a southern Middle Atlantic from what I 
recall.

1203
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:10,320
So that's pretty.
That's pretty safe,

1204
00:56:10,690 --> 00:56:12,470
right?
Where the where the where.

1205
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:15,300
The mythical plastic patches.
Oh,

1206
00:56:15,301 --> 00:56:16,650
the plastic.
That's a pacific.

1207
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:18,800
You think that's mythical?
I Dunno.

1208
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:22,770
I've never seen really a giant,
a real true picture of the Sargasso Sea.

1209
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:26,260
The eels in our last date in their way.
Wow.

1210
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:29,800
That's so creepy.
Look at that fucker making his way.

1211
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:30,870
Beautiful.
Video two.

1212
00:56:30,871 --> 00:56:32,560
And what is pretty cool?

1213
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:38,830
Wow.
This is a guy named boy slot.

1214
00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:42,430
This is name,
who is a young fellow that figured out a

1215
00:56:42,431 --> 00:56:46,030
way to filter out the garbage patch and 
he has been.

1216
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:50,200
He developed this device and they 
recently started implementing it,

1217
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:53,900
but he's been uh,
he's been on the podcast before and when

1218
00:56:53,930 --> 00:56:57,580
a great detail about it,
the garbage patch is real.

1219
00:56:57,810 --> 00:56:59,950
The American Pie.
Whoa.

1220
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:02,290
Look at those fuckers just flopping 
around.

1221
00:57:02,291 --> 00:57:03,124
Yeah.
So they're an American new Nike's a 

1222
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:06,850
instagram page we're on right now.
They're in Maine.

1223
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:07,833
Yeah.

1224
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:09,670
Our aquaculture.
That's cool.

1225
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,450
Demaris Kata is great.
Oysters there too.

1226
00:57:12,090 --> 00:57:16,470
What about,
have you guys ever cooked or eaten?

1227
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:17,670
Blueberry bear.

1228
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:21,230
No,
we don't Mark Marta in Montreal.

1229
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:22,513
Martinez even embarrassed.
He's hunting berry goes and baits every 

1230
00:57:25,791 --> 00:57:29,300
weekend and then he goes in shacks.
And what's a blueberry bear though?

1231
00:57:29,301 --> 00:57:32,120
My friend Steve Rinella.
It's described this to

1232
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:33,883
apparently when bears eat blueberries,
when they find like it's towards the 

1233
00:57:37,521 --> 00:57:40,610
fall in particular when the trend of 
fatten up before they go into the den,

1234
00:57:40,910 --> 00:57:42,830
they'll find these massive fields of 
blueberries.

1235
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:43,933
He,
he shot one in Alaska and this bear had 

1236
00:57:46,791 --> 00:57:47,624
eaten so many blueberries and when they 
opened it up it smelled like 

1237
00:57:49,671 --> 00:57:50,504
blueberries.
The,

1238
00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:55,850
the actual fat had a purple hue to it 
and it's supposed to be as spectacularly

1239
00:57:55,941 --> 00:57:57,950
delicious meat.
Totally makes sense.

1240
00:57:58,230 --> 00:57:59,063
But you know that.
It's funny you say that because I was 

1241
00:58:00,561 --> 00:58:01,394
thinking about that with Venice and 
before we have some friends who had a 

1242
00:58:04,010 --> 00:58:06,400
venison from and what would they visit?
Right?

1243
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:07,913
This is steve cooking it on the show 
shows called mediator will actually a 

1244
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:13,550
guest on the show here Friday.
Um,

1245
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:17,510
but see how the fat tissue to it.
But he said it's,

1246
00:58:17,550 --> 00:58:18,383
it all smells like blueberry.
So he rendered down the bear fat and 

1247
00:58:22,741 --> 00:58:27,000
then because this was all in the field 
and then cook the bear meat is blueberry

1248
00:58:27,001 --> 00:58:29,100
bear meat chunks of it in the fat.

1249
00:58:29,190 --> 00:58:31,680
Well,
if the pigment is a lipid soluble,

1250
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,470
then it would make sense that you find 
it in the fat.

1251
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:37,440
But they made a,
they made experiments,

1252
00:58:37,441 --> 00:58:39,510
are friends with the deer farm and what 
they did,

1253
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:40,793
they wanted to know if the,
the taste of venison was owed to the 

1254
00:58:44,311 --> 00:58:45,144
fact that the diet of the animal or the 
way that hunters traditionally break 

1255
00:58:49,731 --> 00:58:53,130
down the meat in the field,
the field dressing of the meat,

1256
00:58:53,190 --> 00:58:56,520
you know.
So what they did is they put up a beef,

1257
00:58:56,940 --> 00:59:01,290
like a steer and they shot him and they,
they prepared them,

1258
00:59:01,291 --> 00:59:02,124
they dressed him the way you would a 
deer or a moose and then they at the 

1259
00:59:06,331 --> 00:59:08,370
same time did the same thing with the 
deer.

1260
00:59:08,371 --> 00:59:09,204
And then they did the slaughterhouse 
treatment like a commercial treatment 

1261
00:59:12,990 --> 00:59:15,900
for both animal.
And they realize that once you,

1262
00:59:15,901 --> 00:59:17,370
um,
your weight a little bit,

1263
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:18,263
even on the beef before you got it,
before you skin it and everything that 

1264
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:28,270
funky or that Gamey taste will come even
to beef no fracture.

1265
00:59:29,710 --> 00:59:30,543
That's why yeast in nature,
it's probably also they think that you 

1266
00:59:34,881 --> 00:59:38,750
might like the skills to properly 
extract the guts.

1267
00:59:38,751 --> 00:59:41,530
You might perforate the guts sometime.
You might perforate the,

1268
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:43,273
the bile a pouch there.
Parts of the innards might come in 

1269
00:59:47,001 --> 00:59:51,770
contact with the skin will be onto long,
not bled properly as well.

1270
00:59:51,830 --> 00:59:53,240
Yeah.
It's not blend properly.

1271
00:59:53,241 --> 00:59:54,110
And then,
you know,

1272
00:59:54,111 --> 00:59:58,100
it's not chilled super rapidly.
Make you kill in the morning.

1273
00:59:58,340 --> 00:59:59,900
The whole sun is out,
you know,

1274
00:59:59,901 --> 01:00:02,240
you don't have a fridge with you.
We have no water.

1275
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:05,060
And.
But on the other hand,

1276
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:09,930
when we have the wild rabbits,
they taste like juniper,

1277
01:00:10,350 --> 01:00:11,930
like very,
very,

1278
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:14,170
very strongly like juniper.
And that's,

1279
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:18,270
that's in fact the challenge is to get 
rid of some of that juniper taste.

1280
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:19,243
It's like the partridge that we shoot at
the lake and in fact it's spruce spruce 

1281
01:00:23,511 --> 01:00:24,344
tips and instead of when we cook,
sometimes we'll cook meat and then 

1282
01:00:27,231 --> 01:00:28,064
we'll,
we'll even add a partridge or at home 

1283
01:00:30,861 --> 01:00:31,694
I'll have the partridge or a wild rabbit
just as seasoning to the rest of the 

1284
01:00:35,571 --> 01:00:36,200
pot.

1285
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:37,033
You know,
if you look at all the traditional 

1286
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:39,973
French Canadian dishes of hunters,
they're all like all the games that are 

1287
01:00:43,491 --> 01:00:44,710
mixed up,
you know,

1288
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:49,720
so you never have.
This is a modern queasy ne like culinary

1289
01:00:50,361 --> 01:00:55,361
fancy thing to have a breast of 
partridge seared on a bed of cabbage.

1290
01:00:55,490 --> 01:00:57,290
You know,
those things are always treated with,

1291
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,850
like I said earlier,
with fat,

1292
01:00:58,851 --> 01:01:01,460
with like all the spices,
with wine,

1293
01:01:01,461 --> 01:01:03,530
with Cognac,
with layers of like,

1294
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:04,833
you know,
even like organ meats in there and you 

1295
01:01:06,291 --> 01:01:08,690
put a crust over eighth and cabbage,
you know,

1296
01:01:08,691 --> 01:01:10,810
it's like,
that's like we said,

1297
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:13,460
it needs a lot of skills to eat.
Like good game.

1298
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:15,910
Yeah.
I've never had gamey venison.

1299
01:01:15,911 --> 01:01:17,920
I've been very,
very fortunate that I've.

1300
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:19,353
First of all,
I've learned to hunt from people that 

1301
01:01:20,381 --> 01:01:23,410
really know what they're doing.
So we didn't let anything sit out in the

1302
01:01:23,411 --> 01:01:26,530
heat and made sure we opened it up and 
cooled it out quickly,

1303
01:01:26,950 --> 01:01:31,840
but one of the things that they do do 
when guys are deep into the back country

1304
01:01:31,841 --> 01:01:32,674
and they have an animal and they kill it
and it's even in the summer when it's 

1305
01:01:36,011 --> 01:01:38,590
warm out,
what they do is they hang it and give it

1306
01:01:38,591 --> 01:01:39,424
a lot of air circulation.
It develops a crust on the outside and 

1307
01:01:42,671 --> 01:01:44,760
then they cut that cross back.
Um,

1308
01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:48,850
and then the meat underneath it is sort 
of tenderized and a lot of ways in a lot

1309
01:01:48,851 --> 01:01:51,370
of hunters say that it's even more 
delicious that way.

1310
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:53,400
It's protected by the,
by the,

1311
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:56,550
by the crusty created.
Of course it probably starts.

1312
01:01:56,570 --> 01:02:00,220
The bacteriological work starts to work 
inside of that crust.

1313
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:01,083
There's age

1314
01:02:01,090 --> 01:02:03,820
to process by which the meat gets 
standard.

1315
01:02:03,821 --> 01:02:07,270
The first one is the rigor Mortis,
right?

1316
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:09,850
Like the meat rests and the rigor 
mortis.

1317
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:14,140
I guess all the cortisol and everything 
that like stiffens the meat at death.

1318
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:15,453
Well,
the meat will rest and then it's an 

1319
01:02:16,181 --> 01:02:17,014
enzymatic reaction where the enzymes,
where it can break some of the meat 

1320
01:02:19,801 --> 01:02:23,820
fibers and the tougher muscles and stuff
in French.

1321
01:02:23,821 --> 01:02:24,654
The word for arresting meet this called 
[inaudible] on d and fasten is a 

1322
01:02:28,261 --> 01:02:29,190
pheasant,
you know,

1323
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:33,010
because they used to hang the pheasants 
by the neck until they fell.

1324
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:35,620
Falls off the skull.
Then they're ready to eat.

1325
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:37,210
Yeah,
I've seen that before.

1326
01:02:37,211 --> 01:02:39,460
That is so strange.
It's hard to eat.

1327
01:02:39,461 --> 01:02:41,650
I've had it a couple of times when 
people like this,

1328
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:42,693
it tastes like death warmed over.
What the fuck is wrong with these 

1329
01:02:45,221 --> 01:02:46,630
people?
Why are they eating it?

1330
01:02:46,631 --> 01:02:47,580
Like guys,
it's a,

1331
01:02:47,590 --> 01:02:48,423
you know,
a lot people love a strong flavors like 

1332
01:02:50,951 --> 01:02:54,760
blue cheese,
like munster cheese in Germany.

1333
01:02:54,770 --> 01:02:55,750
Uh,
you know,

1334
01:02:55,751 --> 01:02:59,020
so this is all because ultimately if you
just eat it fresh,

1335
01:02:59,021 --> 01:03:01,620
it's chicken of the woods really.
Right.

1336
01:03:02,330 --> 01:03:03,690
So it's good.
Yeah.

1337
01:03:03,790 --> 01:03:06,940
By letting it go a little bit,
letting it ride a little bit.

1338
01:03:06,941 --> 01:03:09,250
They get these like secondary,
tertiary,

1339
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:11,760
intense flavors though

1340
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:16,560
maybe two or talking about probiotics.
You don't those traditional ways.

1341
01:03:16,561 --> 01:03:18,690
You don't always know what you,
why you do them,

1342
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:23,350
but maybe initially they're like you 
incubate the know,

1343
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:25,840
you immunize yourself a little bit,
you know,

1344
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:26,893
like the taste is,
you got to love it after you're used to 

1345
01:03:31,471 --> 01:03:32,304
it,
but initially it might be a way to have 

1346
01:03:34,381 --> 01:03:35,214
some of the bacteria is.
I think you talked about soil based 

1347
01:03:38,101 --> 01:03:42,690
probiotics before I read about that,
like we're realizing that like okay,

1348
01:03:42,691 --> 01:03:45,240
yogurt,
probiotics are not the whole thing,

1349
01:03:45,241 --> 01:03:47,280
you know,
so maybe there's soil based probiotic,

1350
01:03:47,281 --> 01:03:48,114
animal based probiotic maybe were 
completely wrong about what flora we're 

1351
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:55,710
ingesting and maybe there was like a way
to get your flora.

1352
01:03:55,830 --> 01:03:57,000
Yeah,
makes sense.

1353
01:03:57,070 --> 01:04:01,050
I guess there would be some strategies 
for taking that stuff in,

1354
01:04:01,051 --> 01:04:01,884
but I would think flavor wise it would 
mean cause pheasant if you just eat it 

1355
01:04:05,731 --> 01:04:07,410
fresh.
It's delicious.

1356
01:04:07,411 --> 01:04:08,940
It's light.
It's very nice.

1357
01:04:09,270 --> 01:04:10,470
Like I would think that

1358
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:14,810
unless there was no other way to store 
it and they didn't have refrigeration,

1359
01:04:14,811 --> 01:04:16,280
which of course they didn't when they 
first start.

1360
01:04:16,281 --> 01:04:18,800
Refrigeration is a super modern 
invention.

1361
01:04:18,801 --> 01:04:19,634
If you look back,
like I worked for chefs in my 

1362
01:04:22,521 --> 01:04:27,320
apprenticeship that told me stories 
about their apprenticeship and it's like

1363
01:04:27,321 --> 01:04:28,154
night and day,
they said when we woke up in the 

1364
01:04:29,511 --> 01:04:30,344
morning,
we used to have to fill the ovens with 

1365
01:04:31,730 --> 01:04:33,740
coal,
you know,

1366
01:04:33,741 --> 01:04:38,570
and go down to the Ice Locker and dragon
ice block into through the,

1367
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:42,290
what's that stuff called?
The Wood Sawdust,

1368
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:44,930
this sawdust shed.
And I was like,

1369
01:04:44,931 --> 01:04:46,100
what?
Wow,

1370
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:47,053
you know,
is that a lot of these old French 

1371
01:04:48,051 --> 01:04:53,051
restaurants that are famous had coal 
fired ovens and ice block fridges

1372
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:58,800
and the apprentices would live above and
they take shifts.

1373
01:04:58,950 --> 01:04:59,783
You know,
one night they'd be you that would make 

1374
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:03,960
sure it doesn't die because otherwise 
it'd be hard to start again,

1375
01:05:03,961 --> 01:05:04,794
you know,

1376
01:05:05,050 --> 01:05:08,000
like burn every day.
All of it,

1377
01:05:08,001 --> 01:05:11,750
all the time.
The restaurant stove was ultimately,

1378
01:05:11,751 --> 01:05:14,210
it was also heating the whole building 
as well.

1379
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:20,370
The hotel was heated by the wow,
but makes sense.

1380
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:22,630
I mean,
it really does,

1381
01:05:22,810 --> 01:05:23,643
but there's not a lot of animals that 
they would let it get that funky other 

1382
01:05:28,181 --> 01:05:30,340
than shark.
The shark.

1383
01:05:30,370 --> 01:05:33,700
Oh,
they're doing the Iceland or a shark.

1384
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:36,700
There's a Korean dish that I'm actually 
curious to try,

1385
01:05:36,701 --> 01:05:41,680
it's Cape Wing that is fermented,
but until it gets that ammonia flavor,

1386
01:05:41,681 --> 01:05:42,514
you know,
like you smell a camel bear and they 

1387
01:05:44,411 --> 01:05:46,270
pause and you smell it,
smells good,

1388
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:48,940
funky cheese.
Then you go a bit deeper,

1389
01:05:48,941 --> 01:05:50,080
you know,
bigger width.

1390
01:05:50,081 --> 01:05:51,980
And then we were like windex,
you know,

1391
01:05:51,981 --> 01:05:52,814
you got the ammonia.
Some people look for that different 

1392
01:05:55,061 --> 01:05:55,894
cultures or into different flavors is a 
friend of my nandy went to Calcutta 

1393
01:06:00,310 --> 01:06:01,143
three weeks ago and came back with the 
number one candy in Calcutta or in 

1394
01:06:04,601 --> 01:06:05,020
India.

1395
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:08,770
It's just weird candy called pulse.
If we had one right now,

1396
01:06:08,771 --> 01:06:09,604
all three of us.
It's a repulsive candy that tastes 

1397
01:06:11,471 --> 01:06:16,471
incredibly of sulfur and fecal rot.
But in,

1398
01:06:17,730 --> 01:06:19,930
in India,
that's the candy.

1399
01:06:19,990 --> 01:06:22,350
Like people love it.
You know,

1400
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:24,940
in American winemaking and French 
winemaking,

1401
01:06:25,060 --> 01:06:27,100
there's things in winemaking called 
flaws,

1402
01:06:27,630 --> 01:06:31,650
the flaws of wine in France and in 
natural winemaking,

1403
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:34,150
organic winemaking will always be 
volatile.

1404
01:06:34,151 --> 01:06:37,410
Acidity and Bertino miceys,
um,

1405
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:42,400
volatile acidity smells in the wine 
vastly of vinegar.

1406
01:06:42,730 --> 01:06:47,260
And Bertetto miceys smells vastly of 
fecal matter.

1407
01:06:47,261 --> 01:06:49,390
Barnyard fecal matter,
you know,

1408
01:06:49,910 --> 01:06:50,800
uh,
these in,

1409
01:06:50,801 --> 01:06:51,634
in,
in North American wine and even in 

1410
01:06:53,021 --> 01:06:55,850
French wine are considered as flaws.
You know,

1411
01:06:56,290 --> 01:07:01,290
in Japan,
they love natural wines from France that

1412
01:07:03,281 --> 01:07:04,114
have high volatile acidity and 
brettanomyces smells what would be 

1413
01:07:09,041 --> 01:07:09,874
ultimately considered a flawed wine.
And France and natural wine world is 

1414
01:07:13,211 --> 01:07:16,960
considered a delicacy in Japan and the 
natural wine world.

1415
01:07:17,110 --> 01:07:20,170
Wow.
So do they purposely take ones that have

1416
01:07:20,171 --> 01:07:22,540
that funky smell and ship them off to 
Japan?

1417
01:07:22,541 --> 01:07:23,374
Some winemakers,
the line agent will come and visit the 

1418
01:07:26,590 --> 01:07:30,580
seller and usually the winemaker will 
point him in the direction and say,

1419
01:07:30,610 --> 01:07:32,710
maybe this might be for you guys.
Yes,

1420
01:07:32,711 --> 01:07:33,790
yes.
This is what we like.

1421
01:07:33,970 --> 01:07:37,420
We'll take cultivated on purpose and 
that I figure like a,

1422
01:07:37,421 --> 01:07:40,480
nobody right now will come up and say it
outright.

1423
01:07:41,150 --> 01:07:41,983
Uh,
but I believe so as Japanese there are 

1424
01:07:45,131 --> 01:07:50,131
Japanese winemakers now all through 
France that work in a very funky way and

1425
01:07:51,010 --> 01:07:52,340
are more or less,
you know,

1426
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:54,280
pushing those wines into the Japanese 
market.

1427
01:07:54,281 --> 01:07:55,114
Okay.
I have to try this just because it's 

1428
01:07:56,231 --> 01:07:58,450
disgusting.
So tell me what the name of the candy is

1429
01:07:58,451 --> 01:08:01,930
again.
Pulse misspelled that put you lsc.

1430
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:04,680
It's a green mango candy.
Yeah,

1431
01:08:04,690 --> 01:08:05,523
it's originally,
it's a classic snuck right where they 

1432
01:08:07,930 --> 01:08:08,763
use the sulfur salt.
It's called black salt and they'd put a 

1433
01:08:11,681 --> 01:08:16,190
bit of Chili and sulfur salt on mango 
and I have to admit that when I had

1434
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:19,190
the real green mango with the sulfur 
salt is not that bad.

1435
01:08:19,191 --> 01:08:21,650
That candy was like pushed.
It's like the mega warheads,

1436
01:08:21,710 --> 01:08:23,030
you know,
that we had as kids.

1437
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:27,950
I wonder too sometimes the Gamey flavor 
of the cheese.

1438
01:08:27,951 --> 01:08:32,660
That is the yield of that is I see it 
sometimes as a bit of a like,

1439
01:08:32,661 --> 01:08:33,740
you know,
the ghost peppers,

1440
01:08:33,770 --> 01:08:37,350
a bit of a pissing contest between,
you know,

1441
01:08:37,550 --> 01:08:41,710
like it's like no one could possibly 
enjoy the taste of gross prep.

1442
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:42,600
No,
no.

1443
01:08:43,170 --> 01:08:44,650
I mean,
does it even have a taste?

1444
01:08:44,651 --> 01:08:47,000
I mean,
you even responding to that taste.

1445
01:08:47,001 --> 01:08:49,150
I won't even try it.
Who,

1446
01:08:49,410 --> 01:08:50,390
you know,
who loves that,

1447
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:53,240
you know,
alleviate those guys.

1448
01:08:53,241 --> 01:08:55,910
They have like,
they watch like game of thrones,

1449
01:08:55,911 --> 01:08:58,040
they get together and they,
those peppers.

1450
01:08:58,130 --> 01:09:01,430
Oh yeah.
They have like Olivier all Boman mercier

1451
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:05,510
who's a fighter in the UFC and they'll,
they'll have like ghost pepper parties,

1452
01:09:05,511 --> 01:09:06,344
you know,
and then the next day they'll go to 

1453
01:09:06,951 --> 01:09:07,784
comicon and dress up as superheroes and 
then place them online poker and then 

1454
01:09:11,751 --> 01:09:12,890
eat more ghost peppers.

1455
01:09:12,930 --> 01:09:13,763
He's also a UFC fighter.
You got to think he's a very extreme 

1456
01:09:16,071 --> 01:09:18,170
human being.
He's a funny kid,

1457
01:09:18,190 --> 01:09:18,981
but he's very,
very,

1458
01:09:18,981 --> 01:09:20,130
very nice guy.
Yeah.

1459
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:21,800
Brilliant.
No,

1460
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:23,030
that,
he was a trained killer.

1461
01:09:23,230 --> 01:09:25,580
You would have no idea if you talked to 
them.

1462
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:27,320
It just seems like a gentleman.
He's a sweetie.

1463
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:30,380
He's a good kid and it's a good fit for 
us.

1464
01:09:30,381 --> 01:09:31,240
It's interesting.
You know,

1465
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:32,083
we,
we actually have a bit of a chapter in 

1466
01:09:33,651 --> 01:09:34,484
the book where we talk loosely about 
those guys in that relationship where 

1467
01:09:38,571 --> 01:09:41,750
you guys sponsored him or something 
before the reebok thing.

1468
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:42,913
Yeah.
Because I remember one of the fights 

1469
01:09:44,810 --> 01:09:45,643
that we did in Montreal,
we went to your restaurant afterwards 

1470
01:09:49,730 --> 01:09:53,390
and Olivier showed up after his fight 
and you guys were congratulating him and

1471
01:09:54,370 --> 01:09:55,010
his,
uh,

1472
01:09:55,010 --> 01:09:56,900
his fiance's,
his wife works,

1473
01:09:56,901 --> 01:09:59,810
his girlfriend works with us at the 
restaurant for a long time now.

1474
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:01,760
And uh,
you know,

1475
01:10:01,761 --> 01:10:05,340
we met because these guys,
it's interesting,

1476
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:06,313
they're super into food and they're open
to a lot of things and they're curious 

1477
01:10:11,631 --> 01:10:16,160
and a lot of them get aimed in the wrong
direction,

1478
01:10:16,161 --> 01:10:16,994
you know,
like the brown rice and chicken 

1479
01:10:18,711 --> 01:10:19,544
direction and,
and you're responsible for in big part 

1480
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:27,590
for the awakening,
the nutritional awakening of these guys,

1481
01:10:27,591 --> 01:10:28,424
you know,
a lot of them go for their gun license 

1482
01:10:29,751 --> 01:10:33,050
now just to be able to hunt.
They go fishing on the weekend,

1483
01:10:33,051 --> 01:10:36,680
they go for like two hours hike in the 
woods and like little fishing rod.

1484
01:10:36,681 --> 01:10:38,510
They come back with droughts and we get 
a phone call.

1485
01:10:38,511 --> 01:10:39,380
He's like,
Hey Fred,

1486
01:10:39,381 --> 01:10:40,730
I go fish for trout.
You know,

1487
01:10:40,731 --> 01:10:41,960
what do I do with that?
You know,

1488
01:10:41,961 --> 01:10:43,850
it's,
it's a great thing.

1489
01:10:43,910 --> 01:10:45,170
And Yeah,
we did,

1490
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:48,380
we did sponsor them after.
But then what we do now is we,

1491
01:10:48,381 --> 01:10:53,381
um,
we cook for them post way in A.

1492
01:10:54,170 --> 01:10:57,170
Marco did GSP the last fight at Madison 
Square Gardens.

1493
01:10:57,171 --> 01:10:58,700
They were,
the boys were there for a week.

1494
01:10:58,970 --> 01:11:03,530
We've done Tim Kennedy after for a week 
and just hung out and cooked meals.

1495
01:11:03,531 --> 01:11:07,590
We sat in the kids a Marco and Fred goes
and Gab goes,

1496
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:09,740
Gabrielle drop pro.
They go,

1497
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:12,950
they rent a suite and they prepare all 
of the

1498
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:15,233
up to weight cut and afterwards and do 
they have nutritional requirements for 

1499
01:11:19,141 --> 01:11:22,020
the weight cut and like the week they 
do,

1500
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:24,270
they have a nutritionist there with 
them,

1501
01:11:24,330 --> 01:11:28,430
but then they had lines.
But my,

1502
01:11:28,470 --> 01:11:29,303
I have a take on that is if the 
nutritionist writes a plan and the 

1503
01:11:33,091 --> 01:11:35,310
food's not good and you don't eat it,
then it doesn't.

1504
01:11:35,710 --> 01:11:36,690
Doesn't work,
right?

1505
01:11:36,870 --> 01:11:38,220
Like Amoeba,
right on paper.

1506
01:11:38,221 --> 01:11:42,570
But if you don't take the pill then you,
you don't just say chicken and Kale,

1507
01:11:42,571 --> 01:11:44,700
this much grams this.
But we can.

1508
01:11:44,910 --> 01:11:45,743
Professional Cook will make the Kale 
delicious or Brussels Brian's chicken 

1509
01:11:51,691 --> 01:11:55,790
properly because the Kale could be bad 
and the chicken and be dry thing too.

1510
01:11:55,830 --> 01:11:58,740
That works,
that are already suffering.

1511
01:11:59,130 --> 01:12:02,760
The thing that works the best in that 
case is that all of a sudden you have in

1512
01:12:02,761 --> 01:12:05,970
the room,
we set up a little table which is so.

1513
01:12:06,210 --> 01:12:08,700
It's not like playstation dirty,
underwears,

1514
01:12:08,930 --> 01:12:11,630
pre-fight vibe.
It's dining with friends,

1515
01:12:11,670 --> 01:12:15,380
it's dining with friends and whether 
it's Marco Gab me,

1516
01:12:15,390 --> 01:12:17,520
we know we don't talk.
If you don't want to talk,

1517
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:18,780
you want to talk.
We're here,

1518
01:12:18,781 --> 01:12:19,410
you know,
and we'll,

1519
01:12:19,410 --> 01:12:20,221
we'll,
we'll hang out.

1520
01:12:20,221 --> 01:12:23,040
But then you feel like your eggs in that
Tortilla,

1521
01:12:23,041 --> 01:12:27,720
you feel like your eggs with potatoes or
like it's mellow and it helps a lot with

1522
01:12:27,721 --> 01:12:28,554
the,
just the context of not being like 

1523
01:12:30,690 --> 01:12:32,980
ordering pizza from room service.
You know,

1524
01:12:33,050 --> 01:12:35,460
Jordan used to tell us all horror 
stories.

1525
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:36,313
We know before some of his biggest wins 
years ago with George say eating like 

1526
01:12:40,050 --> 01:12:45,050
room service Rigatoni and pizza before 
like a major fight.

1527
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:47,153
You know.
So now it's different and it's fun 

1528
01:12:50,101 --> 01:12:55,101
because like David said earlier,
we have many interests and it's great to

1529
01:12:56,071 --> 01:12:58,350
be able to explore them like that.
You know,

1530
01:12:58,440 --> 01:12:59,273
because we couldn't,
we couldn't do this job if it was for 

1531
01:13:02,461 --> 01:13:06,180
like 12 stoves in the kitchen,
a bunch of pans,

1532
01:13:06,450 --> 01:13:07,283
cooking pieces of meat,
writing books about the seasons and 

1533
01:13:10,530 --> 01:13:12,420
tomatoes and starting again.

1534
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:13,500
Like I,
I couldn't do it.

1535
01:13:13,660 --> 01:13:16,860
Like we love that being a chef.
It's like one dimensional really,

1536
01:13:16,861 --> 01:13:17,694
you know?
And that whether it's like Olivia with 

1537
01:13:19,331 --> 01:13:20,164
it,
it's like going to visit and Neil farm 

1538
01:13:21,211 --> 01:13:22,650
and you know,
like it's,

1539
01:13:22,710 --> 01:13:23,543
it's,
it's makes it worthwhile up to this 

1540
01:13:27,271 --> 01:13:28,104
point.
Well you guys have a great philosophy 

1541
01:13:29,791 --> 01:13:30,624
about that and that's one of the things 
that really came through with the board 

1542
01:13:32,701 --> 01:13:34,500
danger when you guys were in the ice 
shack,

1543
01:13:34,890 --> 01:13:37,620
is that you,
you enjoy living well.

1544
01:13:38,980 --> 01:13:41,220
Yeah.
Everybody has to live better.

1545
01:13:41,940 --> 01:13:43,740
Take care of yourself matter.
Get Out,

1546
01:13:44,190 --> 01:13:46,020
turn your phone off,
sit with your kids,

1547
01:13:46,021 --> 01:13:48,280
listen to brilliant things,
man.

1548
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:50,670
Mind your phone off and come with 
stories.

1549
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:53,050
I had friends,
one of my.

1550
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:54,750
I have all my children now.
I'd,

1551
01:13:55,020 --> 01:13:57,480
I'd love to sit at the table and I'm 
quiet.

1552
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:59,033
I just let them talk and asked me 
questions and watch them and it's just 

1553
01:14:02,731 --> 01:14:04,810
the best.
It's better than my relationship.

1554
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:07,880
My kids is better than any relationship 
I have with any of my best friends.

1555
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:08,733
My kids are more interesting,
my family's more interesting and it's 

1556
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:12,190
work to stay in

1557
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:16,840
contact with your family and even the 
staff,

1558
01:14:16,841 --> 01:14:19,190
you know?
Uh,

1559
01:14:19,540 --> 01:14:23,860
I enjoy very much working in the 
restaurants that we've built.

1560
01:14:24,390 --> 01:14:29,390
Um,
some I work five days a week with people

1561
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:32,350
that I've been working with for 15 
years.

1562
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:37,120
These are important relationships.
It's not employee employer.

1563
01:14:37,121 --> 01:14:40,510
It's if you quit and you to tell me 
you're leaving.

1564
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:42,700
I want to be.
I'm going to go my car and cry.

1565
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:43,593
I've been working with you for 15 years.
My relationship that I have with many 

1566
01:14:46,661 --> 01:14:50,020
people that I work with is intimate.
I've seen their children born.

1567
01:14:50,021 --> 01:14:51,970
I've seen them go through breakups.
I've seen them.

1568
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,350
Their parents die.
I've seen,

1569
01:14:53,351 --> 01:14:57,760
you know,
like we go to war every night at 6:00,

1570
01:14:57,990 --> 01:15:02,990
150 people are coming to eat in the next
three hours in for restaurants.

1571
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:04,870
We,
you know,

1572
01:15:06,610 --> 01:15:11,200
it's a job that's so different than high
stress environment for five minutes,

1573
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:12,340
for two hours.

1574
01:15:12,350 --> 01:15:14,290
It's,
we've got to walk properly.

1575
01:15:14,291 --> 01:15:18,090
We got to where we were knowledgeable of
each other's space.

1576
01:15:18,091 --> 01:15:19,420
So there's a ballet,
you know,

1577
01:15:19,421 --> 01:15:21,970
when you're washing the glasses and the 
food's coming up behind you,

1578
01:15:21,971 --> 01:15:24,140
you know,
you have this sixth sense to know,

1579
01:15:24,141 --> 01:15:25,630
to move,
not to get the plate,

1580
01:15:25,631 --> 01:15:28,990
to burn your elbow and you know,
this ballet,

1581
01:15:28,991 --> 01:15:29,824
we dance every night with these people 
and for us to think that like in most 

1582
01:15:32,741 --> 01:15:33,574
people's,
to still think that we're behind the 

1583
01:15:35,291 --> 01:15:36,124
stove cooking.
I've got more phone calls to get help 

1584
01:15:39,641 --> 01:15:42,670
finding a doctor,
therapist,

1585
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:43,960
whatever,
you know,

1586
01:15:43,990 --> 01:15:44,823
nutrition is for the staff.
Then I got calls about recipes or food 

1587
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:50,500
or you know,
our job is,

1588
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:55,300
I'm an expert in drainpipes,
artisinal plumbing,

1589
01:15:55,390 --> 01:15:57,490
artisinal,
electricity,

1590
01:15:57,880 --> 01:15:59,770
artisinal,
refrigeration.

1591
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:01,633
I know about boring now because you've 
done it yourself like Sarah very 

1592
01:16:07,181 --> 01:16:10,210
decrepit old buildings and you can't,
you know,

1593
01:16:10,211 --> 01:16:11,044
we're running a restaurants with 
employees and a constant burden of 

1594
01:16:15,461 --> 01:16:20,461
payroll and we can't just call everybody
all the time to just so you know,

1595
01:16:20,740 --> 01:16:23,200
by default any good cooking school 
today,

1596
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:24,453
but what Fred is saying,
and Fred is the example of what a great 

1597
01:16:26,711 --> 01:16:29,200
chef should be,
be a very good cook,

1598
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:30,393
a very good person with people's skills,
but should also have a minor and 

1599
01:16:34,570 --> 01:16:35,403
electricity,
plumbing and refrigeration technologies 

1600
01:16:37,981 --> 01:16:38,620
stayed.

1601
01:16:38,620 --> 01:16:40,030
You know,
even even now,

1602
01:16:40,031 --> 01:16:43,510
like we both,
we both don't drink both.

1603
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:46,900
I wouldn't say a health kick butt,
just like wouldn't be there.

1604
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:48,790
You know,
my mind and body,

1605
01:16:48,791 --> 01:16:52,690
we want to be like president and that's,
that's we build something cool.

1606
01:16:52,691 --> 01:16:54,330
I want to appreciate it.
Not Be clouded.

1607
01:16:54,340 --> 01:16:56,170
Overlook that.
That's that.

1608
01:16:56,260 --> 01:16:59,740
Like people don't think about that when 
they get into this job,

1609
01:16:59,830 --> 01:17:00,940
you know,
they,

1610
01:17:01,420 --> 01:17:04,300
they think it's this warrior thing,
this were savage.

1611
01:17:04,301 --> 01:17:05,590
We're going to drink,
we're going to party,

1612
01:17:05,591 --> 01:17:06,424
we're going to do this.
If you want to do that till you're 60 

1613
01:17:08,591 --> 01:17:11,390
and then get a little cottage and right 
paint,

1614
01:17:11,391 --> 01:17:13,820
water color,
buy but buy a sailboat.

1615
01:17:14,510 --> 01:17:15,770
You have to think about it.
You know,

1616
01:17:15,771 --> 01:17:19,150
it's like you can't live that life of 
drinking.

1617
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:23,390
And why do you think that life is 
synonymous with chefs?

1618
01:17:23,690 --> 01:17:27,500
We've been promoted and taught 
ultimately that you will get paid.

1619
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:30,380
You will make money,
you will persevere.

1620
01:17:30,381 --> 01:17:34,550
If you understand how to promote 
excessive eating and excessive drinking,

1621
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:35,953
you will be recompensed.
If you build a place where people come 

1622
01:17:38,781 --> 01:17:41,780
and eat too much and drink too much and 
that spend too much,

1623
01:17:41,781 --> 01:17:43,580
then you will be able to have a life,
a car,

1624
01:17:43,581 --> 01:17:45,560
a house,
and raise children.

1625
01:17:46,190 --> 01:17:47,450
Okay,
so it's all good.

1626
01:17:47,451 --> 01:17:48,284
First you have to learn how to cook.
Then you have to learn how to run a 

1627
01:17:49,731 --> 01:17:51,390
restaurant.
Then you have to learn how to,

1628
01:17:51,420 --> 01:17:55,130
what a restaurant looks like and how to 
run and you know how to host,

1629
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:57,800
how to host,
what the playlist should be like,

1630
01:17:57,801 --> 01:18:00,800
a how to fix a plumbing disaster,
how to fix the electricity,

1631
01:18:00,801 --> 01:18:03,170
the disaster,
how to fix a staff situation.

1632
01:18:03,171 --> 01:18:04,004
Disaster.
How to run a clean house or people are 

1633
01:18:06,681 --> 01:18:11,330
working together with all their 
different idiosyncrasies.

1634
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:17,240
But for my whole apprenticeship,
alcohol was a reward.

1635
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:18,820
You know,
uh,

1636
01:18:18,890 --> 01:18:21,170
you did a good job tonight.
Drink,

1637
01:18:21,260 --> 01:18:24,590
you know.
Then it went from reward.

1638
01:18:24,591 --> 01:18:26,300
Do.
Oh Shit.

1639
01:18:26,390 --> 01:18:28,760
That was like a blood bath in the 
restaurant.

1640
01:18:28,761 --> 01:18:29,594
You know,
we had to pick up this guy at the 

1641
01:18:30,651 --> 01:18:31,790
hospital.
Okay,

1642
01:18:31,850 --> 01:18:33,830
it's not every word.
Let's forget about it.

1643
01:18:33,860 --> 01:18:35,210
Let's drink,
you know.

1644
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:38,270
And it was,
it was always there.

1645
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:40,100
You know,
it's great service.

1646
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:43,160
Let's have a drink.
Shitty food industry.

1647
01:18:43,161 --> 01:18:43,994
But we're also in the wine industry 
because 50 percent of what you're doing 

1648
01:18:45,861 --> 01:18:46,694
is selling food to people and the other 
50 percent of what you're doing is 

1649
01:18:48,471 --> 01:18:49,304
selling alcohol to people.
So by default you're part of the people 

1650
01:18:51,980 --> 01:18:52,813
that sell a liquid drug dealer in that 
you're in that world every day and you 

1651
01:18:58,491 --> 01:19:00,740
go to wine tastings,
you talk with people that sell Silva,

1652
01:19:00,750 --> 01:19:01,880
alcoholic bartenders.

1653
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:02,713
You talked to people that sell wine.
You're partake in eating and other your 

1654
01:19:05,841 --> 01:19:07,670
colleagues,
restaurants and drinking wine.

1655
01:19:07,671 --> 01:19:09,590
Next thing you know,
you have a little bit of celebrity.

1656
01:19:09,591 --> 01:19:10,424
Had been open for 15 years and you look 
back and he'd go to the seven days in a 

1657
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:21,170
week or seven days in a week and I drank
six of them.

1658
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:22,593
I don't feel good on Sunday.
I'm just kind of recovering and then 

1659
01:19:26,610 --> 01:19:27,443
what?
What happens is one week turns into two 

1660
01:19:28,551 --> 01:19:29,384
to four and then you kind of look back 
and you realize in 2017 that you may 

1661
01:19:34,161 --> 01:19:39,161
have drank 48 weeks out of 52,
you know,

1662
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:42,853
and then it goes quick.
Then it's 10 years and you're a 10 year 

1663
01:19:46,071 --> 01:19:46,904
restaurant and you've been drinking five
days out of the week for 10 years and 

1664
01:19:52,491 --> 01:19:53,990
then all of a sudden you kind of have a 
problem.

1665
01:19:53,991 --> 01:19:58,991
You realize that like my day to day is 
based on food and wine.

1666
01:20:00,260 --> 01:20:03,020
Right now I don't want my.
It's not making me happy.

1667
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:07,320
I've had all the wines have had.
All the foods are better for it.

1668
01:20:07,321 --> 01:20:09,450
Not really.
What am I better for?

1669
01:20:09,570 --> 01:20:10,403
Restriction eating less eating,
clean drinking only on very special 

1670
01:20:15,331 --> 01:20:17,400
occasions.
Do you still drink on special?

1671
01:20:17,940 --> 01:20:19,110
I'm completely sober.
No.

1672
01:20:19,410 --> 01:20:24,030
Did you make that decision based on the 
idea that you weren't able to control it

1673
01:20:24,031 --> 01:20:24,864
or just that you.
I'm one of this decision would be to 

1674
01:20:27,991 --> 01:20:32,020
just completely eliminated textbook case
of a person who couldn't.

1675
01:20:32,610 --> 01:20:34,260
Yeah,
I tried several times to stop.

1676
01:20:34,290 --> 01:20:35,940
I googled it.
I read about it.

1677
01:20:35,941 --> 01:20:36,774
It didn't work.
I was intervention by Fred and my 

1678
01:20:38,911 --> 01:20:42,930
managers of the restaurants in January 
twelfth around their 16th.

1679
01:20:42,931 --> 01:20:43,764
I think we figured

1680
01:20:45,210 --> 01:20:46,710
and of this year.
Yeah,

1681
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,300
I'm eight months sober.
Something.

1682
01:20:48,450 --> 01:20:49,410
Congratulations.
Thank you.

1683
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:51,600
And I'm really good.
Thank you.

1684
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:53,020
Thank you.
So you look healthy.

1685
01:20:53,021 --> 01:20:55,920
I'm happy man.
That's like the skin every day.

1686
01:20:56,150 --> 01:20:57,870
It's just been amazing when that 
happens.

1687
01:20:57,930 --> 01:21:00,810
Conversation like I was angry.
Remember long time,

1688
01:21:00,811 --> 01:21:01,644
you know,
I had like,

1689
01:21:01,750 --> 01:21:03,870
no,
it's not only alcoholism,

1690
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:05,093
you know,
I think all alcoholics are codependent 

1691
01:21:07,261 --> 01:21:08,100
somewhat,
you know,

1692
01:21:08,101 --> 01:21:08,934
like it's just,
it had been part of my whole 

1693
01:21:09,991 --> 01:21:12,900
apprenticeship not being sober for so 
many years.

1694
01:21:13,670 --> 01:21:15,990
It was all under control and funny for a
very,

1695
01:21:15,991 --> 01:21:18,240
very long time.
It was always a big part of my life.

1696
01:21:18,241 --> 01:21:19,530
Drinking wine,
eating food,

1697
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:22,270
um,
until it wasn't.

1698
01:21:22,730 --> 01:21:26,910
Then one day I was 45,
my relationship with alcohol changed.

1699
01:21:27,030 --> 01:21:29,280
I became dark.
I became unhappy.

1700
01:21:29,610 --> 01:21:31,890
I had success.
I beautiful children.

1701
01:21:32,060 --> 01:21:34,020
I was not happy.
Uh,

1702
01:21:34,650 --> 01:21:36,780
you know,
I tried many different things.

1703
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:40,800
Nothing worked.
I was intervention by people that I work

1704
01:21:40,801 --> 01:21:42,900
with that are dear to me that I love 
very much.

1705
01:21:42,901 --> 01:21:45,600
I guess that loved me.
They're tired of watching me,

1706
01:21:46,260 --> 01:21:47,790
you know,
make bad decisions.

1707
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:52,040
And I just went to a great rehab called 
Chatsworth that

1708
01:21:55,250 --> 01:21:56,083
educated me.
It always sitting in a classroom with a 

1709
01:21:57,801 --> 01:21:58,634
pad and paper for six hours a day 
learning about the disease called 

1710
01:22:02,931 --> 01:22:07,130
alcoholism,
learning about a disease that 30 percent

1711
01:22:07,131 --> 01:22:09,980
of the population has a,
you know,

1712
01:22:09,990 --> 01:22:13,460
and how and why I was an addict,
you know,

1713
01:22:13,900 --> 01:22:17,330
at first I was inadequate food then I,
you're not a young age after a traumatic

1714
01:22:17,331 --> 01:22:19,340
event.
Then I was an addict about with beer.

1715
01:22:19,341 --> 01:22:22,610
Then I was an addict with marijuana,
like we know all drugs and then I was an

1716
01:22:22,611 --> 01:22:24,800
addict with wine.
A follow up,

1717
01:22:24,801 --> 01:22:26,510
a couple more traumatic events in your 
mind,

1718
01:22:26,620 --> 01:22:29,810
you know,
horrendous apprenticeship and the stress

1719
01:22:29,900 --> 01:22:32,090
of leadership in these restaurants.
And,

1720
01:22:32,091 --> 01:22:32,924
you know,
one thing led to another and my 

1721
01:22:33,651 --> 01:22:37,220
relationship with alcohol became not 
positive with help.

1722
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:39,890
I understood through with education,
I understood.

1723
01:22:39,891 --> 01:22:44,891
And now everything's great.
It's funny too because I cited it as,

1724
01:22:45,471 --> 01:22:46,770
as,
as an example,

1725
01:22:46,830 --> 01:22:48,110
you know,
I don't like to tell him,

1726
01:22:48,111 --> 01:22:49,820
but maybe it's a little bit of 
mentoring,

1727
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:50,713
you know,
I was the canary in the coal mine for 

1728
01:22:52,041 --> 01:22:52,910
Fred,
you know,

1729
01:22:52,911 --> 01:22:54,020
and I decided,
I was like,

1730
01:22:54,050 --> 01:22:54,980
fuck,
you know,

1731
01:22:54,981 --> 01:22:56,900
after Tony passed,
I was like,

1732
01:22:57,380 --> 01:22:58,011
you know,
it was,

1733
01:22:58,011 --> 01:23:02,690
I remember I was working in a new 
project doing tilings and it's like,

1734
01:23:02,750 --> 01:23:04,250
oh,
I heard the news in the morning.

1735
01:23:04,251 --> 01:23:06,010
I went,
I went tile all day

1736
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:09,460
and then I couldn't wait to get home and
have like two bottles of wine.

1737
01:23:09,461 --> 01:23:10,630
And I was like,
why?

1738
01:23:10,990 --> 01:23:15,160
And we were the same about that.
It didn't matter.

1739
01:23:15,161 --> 01:23:18,190
Like what we love that appoint look for 
example,

1740
01:23:18,191 --> 01:23:20,680
we loved mma read,
we love going to the fights.

1741
01:23:20,690 --> 01:23:24,010
We were so fortunate would go and see.
We met the FERTITTA brothers.

1742
01:23:24,030 --> 01:23:27,760
They discussed like we sat with them at 
dinner table,

1743
01:23:27,761 --> 01:23:29,500
we met you,
we met all those guys.

1744
01:23:30,220 --> 01:23:32,780
David loves wine making all the 
winemakers.

1745
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:36,340
We met the best people in the field that
we loved.

1746
01:23:36,490 --> 01:23:37,600
Charmed life,
not happy,

1747
01:23:37,810 --> 01:23:41,610
not happy,
like ungrateful fucking little bricks.

1748
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:42,250
Well,
you know,

1749
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:45,070
I think part of the problem is that 
alcohol is a depressant.

1750
01:23:45,130 --> 01:23:46,750
Correct.
You just,

1751
01:23:46,780 --> 01:23:48,730
you,
you get down,

1752
01:23:48,940 --> 01:23:49,740
it just

1753
01:23:49,740 --> 01:23:50,970
brings you down,
it brings you down,

1754
01:23:50,971 --> 01:23:51,804
it brings your energy level down.
It bringing alcohol is a solvent and it 

1755
01:23:55,921 --> 01:23:59,880
destroys your soft brain tissue and I 
was taught that in Rehab.

1756
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:02,190
So when you drink acetone,
I go,

1757
01:24:02,191 --> 01:24:03,340
no.
Well,

1758
01:24:03,350 --> 01:24:08,350
if it was made by a lovely French 
vineyard with Barney Aroma,

1759
01:24:09,630 --> 01:24:12,480
but do you.
Do you miss anything about the flavor of

1760
01:24:12,481 --> 01:24:15,710
wine with a meal or anything?
Have you ever tried not to.

1761
01:24:16,250 --> 01:24:19,790
I don't even know.
I go to wine tastings.

1762
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:21,840
I was just that raw wine and less in Los
Angeles.

1763
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:22,733
I went to taste all the natural wines.
Beautiful natural wine festival and you 

1764
01:24:26,191 --> 01:24:27,630
can taste them still.
I taste them.

1765
01:24:27,631 --> 01:24:29,490
I don't swallow.
I rinse my mouth out.

1766
01:24:29,510 --> 01:24:30,343
I'm very much involved in natural wine 
and viticulture reading and all that 

1767
01:24:36,151 --> 01:24:36,984
stuff.
That's got to be so weird to have a 

1768
01:24:37,561 --> 01:24:39,030
mouthful of delicious one.

1769
01:24:39,030 --> 01:24:40,500
Just spit it into a bucket.
No,

1770
01:24:40,501 --> 01:24:41,880
it's the same.
Really.

1771
01:24:41,881 --> 01:24:43,060
Yeah.
It's like,

1772
01:24:43,061 --> 01:24:46,350
because that's why did I drink wine?
I'll factory the nose.

1773
01:24:46,351 --> 01:24:49,580
The flavor.
Understanding the winemaker,

1774
01:24:49,620 --> 01:24:50,453
his philosophy,
the geography of where the wine comes 

1775
01:24:54,121 --> 01:24:56,340
from,
his work with,

1776
01:24:56,370 --> 01:24:57,203
you know,
with using organic and biodynamic 

1777
01:24:58,561 --> 01:25:01,260
viticulture.
Not using sulfur,

1778
01:25:01,490 --> 01:25:02,323
uh,
just making this amazing organic 

1779
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:09,320
beverage with very little intervention.
Natural line without side effects.

1780
01:25:11,060 --> 01:25:14,270
I don't have to swallow it because the 
drug is the same drug that it's in.

1781
01:25:14,340 --> 01:25:17,730
That's in all the other ones that they 
can't change flavors.

1782
01:25:17,731 --> 01:25:18,810
What's different?
Yes.

1783
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:20,940
You know,
and what I like is more of the story,

1784
01:25:20,941 --> 01:25:22,460
the guy,
the vineyard,

1785
01:25:22,461 --> 01:25:23,670
the varietals,
this,

1786
01:25:23,740 --> 01:25:24,573
you know,
would you eat at a fine restaurant and 

1787
01:25:25,741 --> 01:25:30,390
have a delicious steak and wine 
accompaniment and then just spit it into

1788
01:25:30,391 --> 01:25:31,260
a bucket.
I've done it.

1789
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:32,520
Goes to the bathroom.

1790
01:25:32,610 --> 01:25:34,230
I had to.
I wasn't really worried.

1791
01:25:34,231 --> 01:25:36,000
He shuts his mouth and he goes to the 
bathroom.

1792
01:25:36,330 --> 01:25:38,160
I was worried.
Mouth full of wine.

1793
01:25:39,270 --> 01:25:40,103
Ryan Ryan grave,
our friend from Elaina that worked with 

1794
01:25:42,781 --> 01:25:46,200
us for years,
Ryan goes to a restaurant and acts for a

1795
01:25:46,201 --> 01:25:47,034
bucket and he'll sit with other people 
in the wine business and they all drink 

1796
01:25:51,961 --> 01:25:52,794
wine and he tastes the wine and he has 
discussions about wine and he tastes it 

1797
01:25:56,131 --> 01:25:58,170
and spits it and you know,
he's an alcoholic.

1798
01:25:58,350 --> 01:26:00,450
Yeah,
he's a recovered alcoholic three years,

1799
01:26:00,451 --> 01:26:02,960
but he's a wine buyer and he's very much
involved.

1800
01:26:03,110 --> 01:26:03,980
Was My mentor when

1801
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:08,690
I got out of Rehab because in Rehab they
were telling me you may never be able to

1802
01:26:08,691 --> 01:26:13,190
go back to the restaurant was a high 
risk of reoffending.

1803
01:26:13,230 --> 01:26:14,240
Yeah.
And I was like,

1804
01:26:14,241 --> 01:26:15,920
I can't,
like I go,

1805
01:26:15,950 --> 01:26:19,070
I don't know anything else.
Like I have no education.

1806
01:26:19,071 --> 01:26:19,904
I've been in kitchens and some 17 way 
too late for med school and we don't do 

1807
01:26:23,271 --> 01:26:24,104
well in that.
I really don't want to clean iceberg 

1808
01:26:26,001 --> 01:26:29,240
lettuce with the fruit and vegetable 
store and try to make a go of that.

1809
01:26:29,420 --> 01:26:30,320
And you know,
it's funny too,

1810
01:26:30,321 --> 01:26:33,890
like even like dealcoholized beer,
nonalcoholic beer,

1811
01:26:33,891 --> 01:26:37,510
it's better than alcoholic beer.
What are you talking about?

1812
01:26:37,550 --> 01:26:38,450
Heineken?
Zero,

1813
01:26:38,451 --> 01:26:39,680
zero man.
Chris.

1814
01:26:39,681 --> 01:26:40,520
Really?
Chris.

1815
01:26:40,550 --> 01:26:42,170
Outstanding.
Really?

1816
01:26:42,230 --> 01:26:43,550
Heineken zero.
Zero.

1817
01:26:44,150 --> 01:26:45,620
Outstanding.
It's really good.

1818
01:26:45,710 --> 01:26:47,490
I just fine.
Well I've only had like.

1819
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:48,680
Oh duals.
No,

1820
01:26:48,700 --> 01:26:50,210
that's good.
Okay,

1821
01:26:50,211 --> 01:26:52,370
so.
So Heineken does it correctly.

1822
01:26:52,490 --> 01:26:52,870
The,
the,

1823
01:26:52,870 --> 01:26:55,130
the,
the order of nonalcoholic beer.

1824
01:26:55,131 --> 01:26:57,080
Okay.
In my head is Heineken zero,

1825
01:26:57,081 --> 01:26:57,914
zero Carlsberg,
zero grolsch zero roll back to zero and 

1826
01:27:05,661 --> 01:27:06,494
then everything else is not good after 
they let me out to death because I'm 

1827
01:27:09,530 --> 01:27:11,030
also celiac.
Right.

1828
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:14,600
And there's a Glutenburg they make in 
Montreal.

1829
01:27:14,601 --> 01:27:19,601
That's no gluten and no alcohol.
Now you can insert any joke you want.

1830
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:22,513
People are signing off the pies,
but I thought these guys are going to 

1831
01:27:25,251 --> 01:27:26,830
talk about heroin.
Fuck you.

1832
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:28,850
Neat.
Meet though.

1833
01:27:28,890 --> 01:27:29,960
Eat meat.
Yes.

1834
01:27:29,961 --> 01:27:31,900
I'm sure it was.
I'm sure that's.

1835
01:27:31,940 --> 01:27:32,773
This is um,
that's fascinating though that you 

1836
01:27:34,161 --> 01:27:38,000
actually still tasted and still it's 
almost like if you're a heroin,

1837
01:27:38,001 --> 01:27:41,480
a heroin addict just scratching the skin
with the needle.

1838
01:27:41,780 --> 01:27:45,050
We don't penetrate.
I don't recommend that my,

1839
01:27:45,170 --> 01:27:46,003
you know,
my therapist and the people that Rehab 

1840
01:27:47,331 --> 01:27:50,150
do not recommend that I taste wine and 
spit it,

1841
01:27:50,260 --> 01:27:51,220
but they don't.

1842
01:27:51,470 --> 01:27:54,710
But I have friends again.
I know a lot of Somalis and even I,

1843
01:27:54,711 --> 01:27:55,544
I know winemakers,
some of the most famous wine makers in 

1844
01:27:58,311 --> 01:27:59,144
the world I've met in burgundy in a bed 
that are completely sober because they 

1845
01:28:04,401 --> 01:28:05,234
wanted to break this cycle of.
My great grandfather was an alcoholic 

1846
01:28:08,451 --> 01:28:11,120
abusive person.
My grandfather was an alcoholic,

1847
01:28:11,121 --> 01:28:13,520
abusive person.
My father was an alcoholic,

1848
01:28:13,521 --> 01:28:18,320
abusive person and I didn't want to take
over this thousand year old winery.

1849
01:28:18,510 --> 01:28:19,343
The legacy of my family.
I didn't want to work here and I'm sure 

1850
01:28:21,621 --> 01:28:22,160
like,
you know what?

1851
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:22,993
All the Epi genetics stuff,
if you don't drink when your kids are 

1852
01:28:26,781 --> 01:28:27,614
young and like they might be a thing 
where you can stop the passing of the 

1853
01:28:30,430 --> 01:28:32,690
gene,
but you did sober October.

1854
01:28:32,691 --> 01:28:33,830
How'd you do?
Fine?

1855
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:36,530
Yeah.
Well I did love it.

1856
01:28:36,830 --> 01:28:37,663
I was the relapse sobriety wasn't.
This was a very crazy sober October 

1857
01:28:41,001 --> 01:28:43,580
because we added this in St fitness 
challenge,

1858
01:28:43,670 --> 01:28:44,503
so I was literally working out between 
three and a half to five and a half one 

1859
01:28:48,021 --> 01:28:49,730
day.
Six and a half hours in a day.

1860
01:28:50,530 --> 01:28:52,880
It was insane.
One day I did five and a half hours.

1861
01:28:52,881 --> 01:28:53,714
I did another hour at night,
six and a half hours in the day it was 

1862
01:28:56,180 --> 01:28:58,880
was trying to kill each other to see who
could get the most points.

1863
01:28:58,881 --> 01:29:02,010
We have a fitness tracker.
We wore a heart rate

1864
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:02,843
monitor.
I heard that the kitchen would score up 

1865
01:29:04,831 --> 01:29:08,490
the amount of points you would get if I 
won the belt right there.

1866
01:29:09,390 --> 01:29:12,420
If you get a 70 percent of your max 
heart rate,

1867
01:29:12,421 --> 01:29:15,030
you get three points per minute.
This is how crazy it got.

1868
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:17,490
Seventy percent of your Max heart rate 
is three points per minute.

1869
01:29:17,491 --> 01:29:20,370
Eighty percent and above your Max heart 
rate is four points per minute.

1870
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:24,630
One day I got a thousand points,
so just think about that.

1871
01:29:24,930 --> 01:29:28,170
Think about how many minutes you have to
exercise at 80 percent of your max heart

1872
01:29:28,171 --> 01:29:29,970
rate to get a thousand fucking points.

1873
01:29:30,160 --> 01:29:33,760
So you think sober help you with 
performance or recoup?

1874
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:36,540
I think I was on drugs the entire time.
This is what I think.

1875
01:29:36,541 --> 01:29:40,980
I think I was on the endorphins that 
come from long range cardio.

1876
01:29:41,190 --> 01:29:41,700
There's,
there's,

1877
01:29:41,700 --> 01:29:44,910
there's a what I was calling the don't.
I don't give a fuck drug.

1878
01:29:45,270 --> 01:29:48,980
There's you get this feeling when you do
Qa,

1879
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:49,833
like everybody always talked about 
runner's high and I never really 

1880
01:29:51,361 --> 01:29:54,750
experienced it even though I'd worked 
out really hard my whole life.

1881
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:57,930
I'd never been into like long range 
cardio.

1882
01:29:58,110 --> 01:30:01,350
I'd never done hours and hours of the 
same activity,

1883
01:30:01,351 --> 01:30:04,980
just droning on either on a bike or 
running.

1884
01:30:05,010 --> 01:30:05,843
I'd never really done that.
I'd run hills for the most part and I'm 

1885
01:30:08,461 --> 01:30:11,250
sure it benefited me and it made me,
made me relaxed.

1886
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:12,353
But is it a totally different level when
you're doing it for three and a half 

1887
01:30:14,251 --> 01:30:16,230
hours,
four hours a day?

1888
01:30:16,660 --> 01:30:18,570
It's true survival mechanism that kicks 
in.

1889
01:30:18,630 --> 01:30:20,070
It's that,
but it's also,

1890
01:30:20,071 --> 01:30:21,720
you feel wonderful.
You,

1891
01:30:21,890 --> 01:30:23,700
you have zero anxiety

1892
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:25,810
and you're still benefiting from that?

1893
01:30:26,420 --> 01:30:26,950
No,
no,

1894
01:30:26,950 --> 01:30:28,030
no.
That's what's interesting.

1895
01:30:28,040 --> 01:30:32,560
Like I've been out of the house for a 
week now because of the fires,

1896
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:33,633
so we've been running around and the 
kids aren't in school so they're here 

1897
01:30:36,761 --> 01:30:38,500
hanging out with me and they,
they,

1898
01:30:38,590 --> 01:30:39,420
you know,
we,

1899
01:30:39,420 --> 01:30:42,930
we haven't had a chance to get our stuff
together,

1900
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:43,793
so it's been very stressful.
So I haven't really been working out 

1901
01:30:45,641 --> 01:30:46,474
much.
I've only worked out once or twice this 

1902
01:30:48,310 --> 01:30:49,570
week,
so I have more stress.

1903
01:30:49,780 --> 01:30:51,940
I feel like a little bit more tense,
a little bit more,

1904
01:30:51,941 --> 01:30:53,530
take a deep breath,
calm down.

1905
01:30:53,980 --> 01:30:56,920
During October I had none of that.
None of that.

1906
01:30:56,921 --> 01:30:59,440
I felt great.
I felt like I was like,

1907
01:30:59,441 --> 01:31:02,980
if you could take how I feel and put it 
in a pill form and give it to people,

1908
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:04,113
everyone will be hooked on it because 
you feel fantastic and I never 

1909
01:31:06,731 --> 01:31:07,564
understood that.
I would see these people running every 

1910
01:31:09,010 --> 01:31:11,950
day and I thought they were just 
exercise fanatics,

1911
01:31:11,951 --> 01:31:16,951
like they just want to be leaner or they
want to just keep maybe the test.

1912
01:31:17,060 --> 01:31:18,130
Yeah,
maybe that's what it was,

1913
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:21,490
but I think there are drug addicts,
there are natural drug addicts,

1914
01:31:21,491 --> 01:31:25,300
but in a very positive way.
I shouldn't call it drug addicts,

1915
01:31:25,301 --> 01:31:27,670
endorphin junkies.
That's what they are.

1916
01:31:27,790 --> 01:31:29,210
Yeah.
It makes sense to do that.

1917
01:31:30,230 --> 01:31:33,800
You would.
Every cycle in nature,

1918
01:31:33,830 --> 01:31:37,610
it's like feast and famine.
It's like running and resting.

1919
01:31:37,850 --> 01:31:40,010
You know if you follow,
if you're a hunter gatherer,

1920
01:31:40,011 --> 01:31:43,130
you don't hunt every day.
You know,

1921
01:31:43,131 --> 01:31:45,200
you follow a cycle is still free for a 
month,

1922
01:31:45,620 --> 01:31:47,310
you'll hunt,
you'll drag back the meat,

1923
01:31:47,420 --> 01:31:48,830
the meat,
Tomi elite a lot,

1924
01:31:48,831 --> 01:31:51,350
and then after the next month there's 
you'll be quiet,

1925
01:31:51,380 --> 01:31:52,213
you'll eat less and then the next month.
So there's very little exercise program 

1926
01:31:56,151 --> 01:31:59,380
out there that look at it like that.
But if you were to look at it over year,

1927
01:31:59,381 --> 01:32:00,040
maybe you'd see it.

1928
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:02,320
Like I see no,
October is more quiet.

1929
01:32:02,321 --> 01:32:04,600
I'll do my month in October,
November,

1930
01:32:04,601 --> 01:32:07,240
we'll be quiet busy with other things 
after that.

1931
01:32:07,241 --> 01:32:10,300
I'll go back to it in December.
It's better for the soul too.

1932
01:32:10,301 --> 01:32:14,620
You don't have this obsession looming 
over you that you have to do it tomorrow

1933
01:32:14,621 --> 01:32:16,480
morning and night and like,
you know,

1934
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:18,070
well my take on it was a little bit 
different.

1935
01:32:18,071 --> 01:32:18,904
My take on it is that everyone's anxiety
levels and all the different stress and 

1936
01:32:21,221 --> 01:32:22,054
all the things we deal with.
A lot of it is because your body has 

1937
01:32:25,250 --> 01:32:30,250
capabilities and you're not using even a
small percentage of those capabilities.

1938
01:32:30,701 --> 01:32:31,730
So it's always like,
what are we doing?

1939
01:32:31,770 --> 01:32:32,620
We're going,
we're going to go.

1940
01:32:32,621 --> 01:32:33,470
We're going to go,
oh yeah,

1941
01:32:33,970 --> 01:32:34,803
and we're in traffic.
You're moving quickly so you're 

1942
01:32:36,371 --> 01:32:37,204
constantly aware of all these cars 
around you and there's all the stress 

1943
01:32:39,700 --> 01:32:44,380
and there's very little physical release
that the body takes part in and for most

1944
01:32:44,381 --> 01:32:45,214
people,
I mean the the great percentage of our 

1945
01:32:46,421 --> 01:32:50,110
population lives a sedentary lifestyle.
They sit in their cars until they get to

1946
01:32:50,111 --> 01:32:50,944
the office,
they sit in their office until they get 

1947
01:32:51,731 --> 01:32:53,320
home.
They sit in front of the TV till they go

1948
01:32:53,321 --> 01:32:53,740
to sleep.

1949
01:32:53,740 --> 01:32:56,400
This is a giant percentage of our 
population,

1950
01:32:56,410 --> 01:32:57,710
whatever number the number is.
Yeah,

1951
01:32:57,720 --> 01:32:58,553
whatever.
It's very normal and occasionally they 

1952
01:32:59,621 --> 01:33:01,480
work out and when they do,
it's a struggle.

1953
01:33:01,990 --> 01:33:06,990
When you force the body into rigorous 
exercise on a constant basis,

1954
01:33:08,290 --> 01:33:12,580
your body's all the needs and have the 
capacity,

1955
01:33:12,590 --> 01:33:15,070
the capabilities that it has.
All those needs are satisfied.

1956
01:33:15,250 --> 01:33:16,083
So what I found is incredibly low 
anxiety levels and I didn't think I had 

1957
01:33:20,021 --> 01:33:20,854
anxiety.
I'm not an anxious person to the point 

1958
01:33:23,021 --> 01:33:25,270
where I thought about taking medication 
for anxiety,

1959
01:33:25,271 --> 01:33:27,880
like I'm nervous or.
But I didn't.

1960
01:33:28,270 --> 01:33:33,270
I didn't know how anxiety free I could 
be until I did this exercise program for

1961
01:33:34,751 --> 01:33:35,330
a month.

1962
01:33:35,330 --> 01:33:36,590
See,
I found that in sobriety,

1963
01:33:36,591 --> 01:33:38,600
the anxiety I was,
I suffered.

1964
01:33:38,690 --> 01:33:40,800
I suffered from anxiety our whole 
careers.

1965
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:43,640
Every day,
200,

1966
01:33:43,641 --> 01:33:45,340
300 people are coming for dinner at my,
you know,

1967
01:33:46,300 --> 01:33:48,950
it's always there.
My scribbling is their staff.

1968
01:33:48,980 --> 01:33:50,960
There's 300 people coming.
It's never goes away.

1969
01:33:50,961 --> 01:33:51,794
There's always people coming for dinner.
It's throwing happy 400 people every 

1970
01:33:55,221 --> 01:33:56,054
night.
But when I was drinking that would just 

1971
01:33:59,750 --> 01:34:02,000
keep the stress going.
Now I'm fine.

1972
01:34:02,030 --> 01:34:05,030
It's gone.
There's this magic number and it kept on

1973
01:34:05,031 --> 01:34:07,630
hearing and Rehab and he kept on hearing
through therapy.

1974
01:34:08,330 --> 01:34:10,400
Sixteen weeks,
16 weeks.

1975
01:34:10,401 --> 01:34:10,821
And I was like,
yeah,

1976
01:34:10,821 --> 01:34:11,654
shut up.
Fuck.

1977
01:34:11,740 --> 01:34:14,810
It was this fucking guys I was telling 
you with your 16 weeks or 16 weeks,

1978
01:34:14,811 --> 01:34:15,820
man,
big watch.

1979
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:20,840
Sixteen weeks the morning.
Sixteen weeks.

1980
01:34:21,170 --> 01:34:26,170
That morning I woke up that morning and 
I have my phone set up to 16 weeks and I

1981
01:34:28,851 --> 01:34:33,851
had this peace and this joy and this 
childhood innocence that I hadn't had in

1982
01:34:39,381 --> 01:34:42,530
years on the day.
Sixteen weeks.

1983
01:34:42,620 --> 01:34:45,440
Not because I'd been premeditating into 
my head and I was looking forward to the

1984
01:34:45,441 --> 01:34:46,640
16 weeks.
I didn't believe in it,

1985
01:34:47,330 --> 01:34:51,380
but it was literally 16 weeks of 
sobriety that brought this.

1986
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:56,120
I was clear that during this club that 
had no problem.

1987
01:34:56,720 --> 01:34:57,950
I'll be in half an hour.

1988
01:34:58,420 --> 01:35:00,430
Yeah,
like as it should be free.

1989
01:35:00,520 --> 01:35:02,990
Just don't work.
The lights are out in the restaurant and

1990
01:35:03,120 --> 01:35:05,330
five tables are unhappy.
I'm coming down.

1991
01:35:05,450 --> 01:35:06,010
Do you think

1992
01:35:06,010 --> 01:35:06,843
some of the anxiety was just your body 
responding to the fact that you were 

1993
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:10,280
poisoning?

1994
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:11,113
Correct.
Think it's the psyche creating reasons 

1995
01:35:15,410 --> 01:35:16,243
for you to drink.
Your mind is telling you you're 

1996
01:35:19,551 --> 01:35:21,710
stressed.
I have a quick remedy for it.

1997
01:35:22,280 --> 01:35:25,010
Why don't you try drinking that makes 
you feel this way?

1998
01:35:25,310 --> 01:35:26,510
What's your go to?
I'd be like,

1999
01:35:26,540 --> 01:35:29,280
I could taste sometimes when I'd fall 
into stacks,

2000
01:35:29,310 --> 01:35:32,150
full situations at the restaurant,
three tables.

2001
01:35:32,151 --> 01:35:36,410
I don't like a couple of criminal 
elements behaving badly at one table,

2002
01:35:36,950 --> 01:35:37,783
you know,
maybe I'm the board or of lacking 

2003
01:35:39,471 --> 01:35:43,310
respect to their waitress.
I might have to get involved and I could

2004
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:46,450
almost taste chardonnay and delivery 
glads yeah,

2005
01:35:46,460 --> 01:35:47,293
your brain's still plays a trick on 
brain was making me high before the 

2006
01:35:50,751 --> 01:35:52,070
high.
I always like,

2007
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:53,713
why do I taste Chablis in my mouth?
I think it's the same with sugar 

2008
01:35:57,741 --> 01:35:58,574
addiction too.
You know where people eat sugar or lots 

2009
01:36:01,341 --> 01:36:02,600
of carbs,
mostly carbs.

2010
01:36:03,110 --> 01:36:04,310
Then you're like,
oh man,

2011
01:36:04,311 --> 01:36:04,610
I can't.

2012
01:36:04,610 --> 01:36:06,530
I have to go for three hours without 
eating.

2013
01:36:06,590 --> 01:36:07,423
I have to bring something sweet with me 
because I'm going to get shaky and then 

2014
01:36:09,980 --> 01:36:11,660
you have.
It's your.

2015
01:36:11,890 --> 01:36:15,440
It's like you're feeding basically.
I don't know if it's your gut biome that

2016
01:36:15,620 --> 01:36:18,260
changes,
but you're like feeding a monster inside

2017
01:36:18,261 --> 01:36:20,090
of you.
You're not feeding Fred or David,

2018
01:36:20,570 --> 01:36:22,490
you're feeding something else.
You know,

2019
01:36:22,940 --> 01:36:25,910
like you're planning a weekend at the 
cottage or like the kids are going to be

2020
01:36:25,911 --> 01:36:26,744
loud.
I'm going to have to bring two more 

2021
01:36:27,471 --> 01:36:28,304
bottles of wine and have to make sure 
that the wine is cold and have to make 

2022
01:36:30,981 --> 01:36:34,220
sure we have that or like you have to 
have friends like that.

2023
01:36:34,540 --> 01:36:35,373
I have to make sure you have like for 
granola bars because they have to eat 

2024
01:36:37,071 --> 01:36:37,904
all the time and you know that if you 
don't have breakfast you have like a 

2025
01:36:41,031 --> 01:36:41,864
quick coffee,
you can go to like four or five in the 

2026
01:36:43,251 --> 01:36:47,600
afternoon and not shaking and getting 
cold and Sweaty,

2027
01:36:47,770 --> 01:36:48,603
you know?

2028
01:36:48,610 --> 01:36:49,220
Well,
depends.

2029
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:51,160
Especially if you have a good healthy 
diet.

2030
01:36:51,450 --> 01:36:53,770
If your body's not like sugar,
sugar dependent,

2031
01:36:53,950 --> 01:36:54,783
I think it's funny every time you know,
sometimes we fall off the wagon and 

2032
01:36:59,321 --> 01:37:01,420
stuff not as pretty solid for a few 
years.

2033
01:37:02,680 --> 01:37:05,950
I think that two weeks of drinking more 
water,

2034
01:37:06,340 --> 01:37:07,173
having walks and not eating ice cream 
and fries and two weeks of home cooked 

2035
01:37:12,041 --> 01:37:12,874
meals and water cutting down on coffee 
because that dude will fuck with your 

2036
01:37:16,121 --> 01:37:17,020
anxiety,
you know?

2037
01:37:17,140 --> 01:37:19,240
Sure.
We noticed that both of us,

2038
01:37:19,590 --> 01:37:21,250
all of this,
like so many diseases,

2039
01:37:21,251 --> 01:37:25,960
is based simply on overconsumption just 
period over consumption of cigarettes,

2040
01:37:25,961 --> 01:37:28,030
over consumption of alcohol,
over consumption of sugar,

2041
01:37:28,031 --> 01:37:33,031
over consumption of meat,
carbs like restriction brings clarity.

2042
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:34,193
December restriction diets are one of 
the best remedies for people with 

2043
01:37:36,271 --> 01:37:37,770
autoimmune diseases.
Oh really?

2044
01:37:37,890 --> 01:37:38,670
Yeah.
Well,

2045
01:37:38,670 --> 01:37:39,503
cut down almost everything out of your.
One of the things that people are doing 

2046
01:37:41,641 --> 01:37:42,474
today that's very popular but keep 
talking about this unfortunately is the 

2047
01:37:44,911 --> 01:37:45,744
carnivore diet because Jordan Peterson 
made it very popular when he was on the 

2048
01:37:49,411 --> 01:37:51,300
podcast.
It's really fascinating.

2049
01:37:51,301 --> 01:37:54,210
There's a spike.
If you look at the Google search results

2050
01:37:54,230 --> 01:37:56,160
or carnivore,
it's July

2051
01:37:56,370 --> 01:37:58,140
of 2018.
He goes like this.

2052
01:37:58,170 --> 01:38:01,800
He takes off because that's the day that
Jordan was on the podcast,

2053
01:38:02,010 --> 01:38:03,450
so he's in the podcast,
you know,

2054
01:38:04,290 --> 01:38:05,123
fucking whatever amount of millions of 
people listening to this in order and 

2055
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:09,473
because of his ranting and raving about 
the positive benefits that he's 

2056
01:38:12,841 --> 01:38:15,540
experienced.
So I got on the carnivore diet.

2057
01:38:15,541 --> 01:38:17,820
People really got into it,
so I got into it as well,

2058
01:38:17,821 --> 01:38:18,654
like what is it about this?
So I started consulting a lot of actual 

2059
01:38:21,571 --> 01:38:22,404
nutrition experts and scientists and 
what they believe is what's going on as 

2060
01:38:24,931 --> 01:38:25,764
calorie restriction.
That because of the fact that you're 

2061
01:38:27,391 --> 01:38:28,224
only.
Jordan is only eating steak with salt 

2062
01:38:31,950 --> 01:38:32,783
and drinking water,
that is all he's consuming and he feels 

2063
01:38:34,921 --> 01:38:38,520
fantastic because it's a lean steak.
Now real estate,

2064
01:38:38,670 --> 01:38:39,241
yes,
fatty.

2065
01:38:39,241 --> 01:38:41,460
So then you can't do much because you 
have the fat.

2066
01:38:41,820 --> 01:38:42,810
You're feeling full.

2067
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:43,730
Yeah,
yeah,

2068
01:38:43,980 --> 01:38:46,140
yeah.
That fat is important.

2069
01:38:46,230 --> 01:38:47,063
Yeah.
And because this is quite a few 

2070
01:38:48,511 --> 01:38:49,344
autoimmune issues that he had went away.
He was having receding gums that went 

2071
01:38:53,371 --> 01:38:54,370
away.
Uh,

2072
01:38:54,390 --> 01:38:58,140
he uh,
was having severe depression and anxiety

2073
01:38:58,141 --> 01:38:59,640
and all these different issues that went
away.

2074
01:38:59,820 --> 01:39:01,470
You announced a tremendous amount of 
weight.

2075
01:39:01,471 --> 01:39:05,790
His body leaned up and science.
The scientists that have talked about,

2076
01:39:06,170 --> 01:39:07,003
you know,
this is a very new thing for people to 

2077
01:39:08,611 --> 01:39:12,630
embark on this and do it on a mass scale
because quite a few people doing it.

2078
01:39:12,930 --> 01:39:13,763
What they're attributing it to is the 
calorie restriction is that because of 

2079
01:39:16,411 --> 01:39:17,244
the fact that you're in,
you really can't eat that much stake if 

2080
01:39:18,971 --> 01:39:20,640
you eat a steak,
you know,

2081
01:39:20,641 --> 01:39:23,860
it might be a thousand calories.
Whereas if immediate,

2082
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:24,713
full,
big fixed day closet galleries the 

2083
01:39:26,951 --> 01:39:28,470
stakes a lot at stake.
Right?

2084
01:39:28,471 --> 01:39:29,304
Yeah.
But I mean he might be eating two of 

2085
01:39:30,841 --> 01:39:31,800
those in a day.

2086
01:39:32,070 --> 01:39:35,850
Whereas if you're eating French fries 
and soda,

2087
01:39:35,940 --> 01:39:38,530
empty calories,
you're getting shade here.

2088
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:40,920
Like way more than that.
Like what do you think?

2089
01:39:40,921 --> 01:39:41,754
Uh,
an 18 ounce rib eye is if you had a 

2090
01:39:43,801 --> 01:39:48,450
guest calorically 11,
1800 and 800,

2091
01:39:48,510 --> 01:39:52,050
800 bands.
If you have like the end of the rack in.

2092
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:52,913
Okay.
So let's,

2093
01:39:53,010 --> 01:39:55,020
let's just get crazy.
Let's call it 700.

2094
01:39:55,160 --> 01:39:55,993
It's probably like at 1700 calories a 
day because he's not putting cream in 

2095
01:39:59,310 --> 01:40:00,143
the coffee's not having a seven.
That's the water went steak when I 

2096
01:40:04,321 --> 01:40:05,700
started eating.
No gluten,

2097
01:40:05,701 --> 01:40:07,530
right.
It's fully diagnosed,

2098
01:40:07,950 --> 01:40:09,270
right?
I'm not making this up.

2099
01:40:09,750 --> 01:40:11,220
I stopped,
I stopped eating gluten.

2100
01:40:11,340 --> 01:40:13,650
It gets flagged every day.
What does that mean?

2101
01:40:13,651 --> 01:40:15,260
Everybody gets crazy about the gluten 
go.

2102
01:40:15,270 --> 01:40:17,130
He is like here it,
I don't want to hear it.

2103
01:40:17,190 --> 01:40:19,950
We don't want to like what I said,
but what does it mean?

2104
01:40:19,950 --> 01:40:23,060
You don't eat gluten?
Smoking cigarettes,

2105
01:40:23,070 --> 01:40:24,600
like come on now.
But what does it mean?

2106
01:40:24,660 --> 01:40:26,320
No gluten.
It means that you don't go to,

2107
01:40:26,380 --> 01:40:27,640
you know,
drive drew,

2108
01:40:27,720 --> 01:40:28,620
you know,
slip,

2109
01:40:28,740 --> 01:40:33,000
right?
There's no options out there in the fast

2110
01:40:33,001 --> 01:40:34,380
food world.
There's no.

2111
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:36,950
So I have to plan my day,
so I like,

2112
01:40:37,230 --> 01:40:40,320
I'll eat a piece of meat for breakfast 
with or eggs or whatever,

2113
01:40:40,530 --> 01:40:44,280
and then I won't eat until like show up 
at work or at home later and eat.

2114
01:40:45,210 --> 01:40:49,410
So it's with you've excluded that 
counts.

2115
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:50,333
Yes.
It's not that this steak is so good for 

2116
01:40:51,781 --> 01:40:54,250
you,
is that you're not eating

2117
01:40:54,250 --> 01:40:57,100
all this processed food anymore because 
you can't eat it anymore.

2118
01:40:57,160 --> 01:41:00,190
That's what the scientists are saying.
But the people that are pro meet,

2119
01:41:00,220 --> 01:41:03,670
it's really fascinating because they're 
just as culty as the vegans are.

2120
01:41:03,970 --> 01:41:07,780
The people that are the real pro 
carnivore diets,

2121
01:41:08,020 --> 01:41:08,853
they want you to think that it's the 
meat that's healing and the meat that's 

2122
01:41:11,891 --> 01:41:14,380
helping them meet,
that's making them lean that meat.

2123
01:41:14,720 --> 01:41:15,700
Well,
it's not hurting you.

2124
01:41:15,701 --> 01:41:17,200
I mean it's,
it's nutritious.

2125
01:41:17,230 --> 01:41:18,063
I mean there's a lot of real nutrients 
and red meat and this is also a problem 

2126
01:41:21,551 --> 01:41:22,384
with a lot of studies that people have 
that a lot of vegans love to cite about 

2127
01:41:27,070 --> 01:41:29,110
heart attacks,
strokes,

2128
01:41:29,111 --> 01:41:32,890
cancer in relationship to meet these 
epidemiology studies that were.

2129
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:34,990
There essentially is they're saying,
look,

2130
01:41:34,991 --> 01:41:36,940
when you look at people that eat meat 
five days a week,

2131
01:41:37,120 --> 01:41:39,850
these are the people that have higher 
instances of cancer,

2132
01:41:39,851 --> 01:41:42,070
higher instances of diabetes,
all these different things.

2133
01:41:42,370 --> 01:41:44,860
Where they're not taking into 
consideration is they're not just eating

2134
01:41:44,861 --> 01:41:45,694
meat.
They're usually eating a cheeseburger 

2135
01:41:46,870 --> 01:41:49,990
with fries and a soda and there's all 
this sugar.

2136
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:54,430
It's before dinner and all this bullshit
that's that's involved with the meat.

2137
01:41:54,490 --> 01:41:59,490
There's not any studies that show that 
people who eat a lot or a 12 ounce grass

2138
01:41:59,981 --> 01:42:04,930
fed steak with a good plate of sauteed 
spinach and olive oil and garlic,

2139
01:42:04,931 --> 01:42:05,764
that these people are getting cancer and
I can't make a nutritional study or 

2140
01:42:10,581 --> 01:42:13,000
that's impossible.
People fundamentally lie,

2141
01:42:13,570 --> 01:42:16,360
so you cannot have people you cannot say
like,

2142
01:42:16,390 --> 01:42:19,990
this is coco fat and beef tenderloin.
I'm going to give you a week portion.

2143
01:42:19,991 --> 01:42:21,940
You'll go home.
Then you come to report.

2144
01:42:21,941 --> 01:42:22,774
We do blood tests.
You get anecdotal evidence from people 

2145
01:42:25,350 --> 01:42:27,280
that talk about their own personal diet,
but yeah,

2146
01:42:27,281 --> 01:42:27,960
it's,
it's,

2147
01:42:27,960 --> 01:42:31,960
it's very difficult and it's also very 
ideologically based.

2148
01:42:32,290 --> 01:42:36,340
I mean,
whether it's on one side with the vegans

2149
01:42:36,341 --> 01:42:38,260
are the other side where the carnivore 
diet people,

2150
01:42:38,261 --> 01:42:41,680
I find the same psychological 
characteristics in both groups.

2151
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:44,380
They want to convert people,
they want to proselytize,

2152
01:42:44,381 --> 01:42:47,160
they want people to think that their way
is the right way and they,

2153
01:42:47,190 --> 01:42:50,110
they are not honest about health issues 
that they're having.

2154
01:42:50,140 --> 01:42:53,560
You should make like a,
a conference on a deserted island,

2155
01:42:53,561 --> 01:42:54,250
you know,
and uh,

2156
01:42:54,250 --> 01:42:55,083
Richmond's gas.
So like a Bruce Lee movie and knew you 

2157
01:42:56,950 --> 01:43:00,310
invite the vegans on one side and you 
don't tell them you're also inviting the

2158
01:43:00,311 --> 01:43:01,144
other,
you know,

2159
01:43:01,300 --> 01:43:03,500
and then both groups it just have like 
a,

2160
01:43:04,130 --> 01:43:07,210
well both think the other group is going
to drop dead at any second.

2161
01:43:07,211 --> 01:43:08,044
Now the proof is in the pudding.
If somebody is on your podcast to talk 

2162
01:43:12,641 --> 01:43:14,620
about eating meat,
that he's alive and he's not dead.

2163
01:43:14,620 --> 01:43:15,980
So it works,
you know,

2164
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,720
like white look any further.
Well,

2165
01:43:18,730 --> 01:43:20,140
who knows how long they're gonna last.
Well,

2166
01:43:20,141 --> 01:43:22,200
none of us are getting out of this alive
now,

2167
01:43:22,230 --> 01:43:24,320
that's for sure.
When it comes to meat,

2168
01:43:24,820 --> 01:43:29,820
do you guys prefer a grass fed beef or 
do you like a corn fed?

2169
01:43:30,610 --> 01:43:31,443
Because I had this discussion with Tony 
and he was telling me that he actually 

2170
01:43:34,901 --> 01:43:36,660
likes corn fed beef.
He's like,

2171
01:43:36,670 --> 01:43:37,503
it's a fattier that there's two schools 
of thought and then there's two schools 

2172
01:43:41,141 --> 01:43:44,080
of what is quality beef,
right.

2173
01:43:45,820 --> 01:43:49,020
So one school say,
yeah,

2174
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:52,040
quality beef is organic

2175
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:57,040
animal pasture raised,
eating grass flavors different.

2176
01:43:58,400 --> 01:44:02,180
It's not as tender,
but it is high quality beef.

2177
01:44:02,900 --> 01:44:04,790
Okay.
Then the other of course says,

2178
01:44:04,820 --> 01:44:06,410
you know,
a cow Usta,

2179
01:44:06,411 --> 01:44:08,600
prime grow,
corn fed,

2180
01:44:09,350 --> 01:44:12,980
incredible marbling,
ridiculous fat content.

2181
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:18,280
Restricted motion.
I'd say a lesser quality beef.

2182
01:44:21,400 --> 01:44:22,990
Okay.
Then then the other,

2183
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:28,200
but they all start eating wise.
They'll pastored at first eating wise,

2184
01:44:30,020 --> 01:44:31,990
you know,
gram per pound for pound.

2185
01:44:32,980 --> 01:44:35,980
The corn fed steak will be more 
delicious.

2186
01:44:36,850 --> 01:44:38,770
Okay.
For some people.

2187
01:44:39,530 --> 01:44:42,340
And then for some people,
the other one will be,

2188
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:43,233
in my mind,
the grass fed organic pasture beef with 

2189
01:44:49,550 --> 01:44:53,290
a different flavor.
For me as a higher quality animal,

2190
01:44:53,410 --> 01:44:55,260
I.
I prefer that taste correct.

2191
01:44:55,261 --> 01:44:57,480
I feel it's a Richard taste.
It's a denser,

2192
01:44:57,481 --> 01:44:59,730
darker meat more than iron taste.
Yeah.

2193
01:44:59,731 --> 01:45:03,600
I just like it better and I do like a 
corn fed steak.

2194
01:45:03,630 --> 01:45:06,570
I do,
but in the general public,

2195
01:45:06,630 --> 01:45:07,463
the steak eating public that come to 
restaurants and counter more grow corn 

2196
01:45:12,811 --> 01:45:17,811
fed beef that and the first judge of 
character to the quality of that meat is

2197
01:45:21,590 --> 01:45:23,790
tendering.
It's tenderness.

2198
01:45:23,791 --> 01:45:25,860
It's marble.
It's not tender.

2199
01:45:25,861 --> 01:45:28,530
It's not tender.
That's a reoccurring thing that we fight

2200
01:45:28,531 --> 01:45:29,364
with every day.
A job while the tender to see the 16 

2201
01:45:32,371 --> 01:45:36,180
ounce fog walk tender.
I know.

2202
01:45:36,210 --> 01:45:37,440
I mean,
what are they looking for?

2203
01:45:38,720 --> 01:45:41,280
Are Your teeth work?
But we get to take sent back.

2204
01:45:41,281 --> 01:45:41,870
It'll be big

2205
01:45:41,870 --> 01:45:42,703
because

2206
01:45:43,780 --> 01:45:44,810
it's too tough.
Yeah,

2207
01:45:45,430 --> 01:45:46,263
exactly.
It's not always usually go to the 

2208
01:45:47,470 --> 01:45:48,303
steakhouse and it's tender because 
you're bringing your serving a grass 

2209
01:45:51,070 --> 01:45:52,330
fed,
grass fed,

2210
01:45:52,410 --> 01:45:55,960
grass fed steak that's not as marbled 
as.

2211
01:45:55,961 --> 01:45:57,480
It's not organic.
Well,

2212
01:45:57,490 --> 01:45:59,530
it's an.
It's an animal that's healthy,

2213
01:45:59,620 --> 01:46:01,950
but you can also have.
It's an upgrade though.

2214
01:46:01,990 --> 01:46:04,480
It's like the natural wine versus 
conventional wind fight.

2215
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:05,390
Right.
Then we're having,

2216
01:46:05,391 --> 01:46:05,920
you know.
Yeah,

2217
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:09,250
but it's also.
We're calling it binary now.

2218
01:46:09,251 --> 01:46:12,100
It's like it's only corn or it's only 
grass.

2219
01:46:12,430 --> 01:46:13,263
No,
I think the solution is maybe a little 

2220
01:46:14,921 --> 01:46:16,480
bit of corn,
a little bit of barley,

2221
01:46:16,481 --> 01:46:18,400
but mostly grassfed,
you know,

2222
01:46:18,610 --> 01:46:21,310
a brief finish and like quality grains,
why not?

2223
01:46:21,550 --> 01:46:24,750
And then there's a whole other point I'd
like to raise giant feedlot.

2224
01:46:24,860 --> 01:46:26,320
I like to sell beef,

2225
01:46:26,770 --> 01:46:27,603
uh,
in my restaurant that comes from very 

2226
01:46:29,961 --> 01:46:31,160
close to my restaurant,

2227
01:46:32,260 --> 01:46:33,150
you know?
Yeah.

2228
01:46:33,220 --> 01:46:34,840
When we opened joe beef at the 
beginning,

2229
01:46:34,841 --> 01:46:36,880
when that first book,
the first book was written,

2230
01:46:37,550 --> 01:46:40,840
a beef was a problem back then,
you know,

2231
01:46:40,841 --> 01:46:43,510
local beef was kind of difficult and you
know,

2232
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:48,070
we were buying beef from larger 
wholesalers and we,

2233
01:46:48,220 --> 01:46:51,600
if we didn't how to read the barcodes on
the boxes,

2234
01:46:51,990 --> 01:46:55,160
they would say it was Canadian beef,
but it might not be safe.

2235
01:46:55,260 --> 01:46:56,093
It might be north northern USA beef,
but we didn't know because only a 

2236
01:47:00,661 --> 01:47:03,690
professional could read the Barcode.
But they were saying it was Canadian.

2237
01:47:03,691 --> 01:47:06,480
But one day I had a professional come 
into the restaurant and he said,

2238
01:47:06,481 --> 01:47:07,770
no,
actually this beef is.

2239
01:47:07,771 --> 01:47:08,604
Yeah,
from a company with investiture is in 

2240
01:47:12,031 --> 01:47:14,700
Canada,
but this is from Western Australia and I

2241
01:47:14,701 --> 01:47:15,534
said I don't want to serve anything in 
my restaurant from Western Australia 

2242
01:47:20,280 --> 01:47:25,280
that's super far removed from the menu 
or seek alternatives.

2243
01:47:28,180 --> 01:47:29,013
Uh,
but it's a business that's complex 

2244
01:47:30,691 --> 01:47:35,691
because there's past years in feed,
lots slaughterhouse and packers.

2245
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:40,720
Right.
And it's not like we have lambs,

2246
01:47:41,060 --> 01:47:45,060
get a baby lamb that come from the 
parents lamb and then they farm,

2247
01:47:45,061 --> 01:47:45,894
they raised the lamb and they bring it 
to the slaughterhouse themselves and 

2248
01:47:47,671 --> 01:47:49,440
then we get a lamb.
Beef is like,

2249
01:47:49,710 --> 01:47:51,750
you can get it.
It's like tracing bourbons,

2250
01:47:51,751 --> 01:47:52,584
you know,
it's like trading and brokerage and 

2251
01:47:55,231 --> 01:47:56,064
stuff and we're not,
it's the most sketchy item on a 

2252
01:47:58,081 --> 01:47:58,914
restaurant menu.
Like I know that I bought land from you 

2253
01:48:01,470 --> 01:48:02,303
and I know I bought rabbit from Beatrice
and I know I got goat cheese from this 

2254
01:48:06,841 --> 01:48:09,300
family and all of the products in my 
restaurant.

2255
01:48:09,301 --> 01:48:14,301
I know exactly the farm and the farmer 
beef is always dicey because beef always

2256
01:48:17,401 --> 01:48:20,080
goes to the packer,
be followers,

2257
01:48:20,100 --> 01:48:20,933
goes to the distributor you fall to.
And the general public only really eats 

2258
01:48:26,041 --> 01:48:28,290
two cuts of beef in restaurants,
you know,

2259
01:48:28,291 --> 01:48:29,700
three cuts,
the tenderloin,

2260
01:48:29,710 --> 01:48:30,250
the,
the,

2261
01:48:30,250 --> 01:48:31,083
the,
the,

2262
01:48:31,140 --> 01:48:32,790
what do you call it in English though?
I'll throw a coat,

2263
01:48:33,110 --> 01:48:35,580
you know the lines,
right?

2264
01:48:35,581 --> 01:48:37,320
That's what people lead.
But in the hamburgers,

2265
01:48:37,380 --> 01:48:38,850
beefs or not that,
you know,

2266
01:48:38,851 --> 01:48:39,684
there's two big humps and there's two 
big shoulders and there's a lot of 

2267
01:48:42,151 --> 01:48:42,984
braids.

2268
01:48:43,220 --> 01:48:44,560
So,
you know,

2269
01:48:45,080 --> 01:48:45,913
it's uh,
it's difficult to see that documentary 

2270
01:48:48,501 --> 01:48:49,770
on steak.
Yeah,

2271
01:48:50,290 --> 01:48:51,290
we were.
Yeah.

2272
01:48:51,710 --> 01:48:52,543
You were in it,
right?

2273
01:48:52,910 --> 01:48:53,743
What did you think of that,
their conclusions and what was the 

2274
01:48:56,901 --> 01:48:58,440
conclusion?
Well,

2275
01:48:58,441 --> 01:48:59,274
it just basically we're saying to Peter 
Luger's steakhouse in Brooklyn's a 

2276
01:49:02,180 --> 01:49:06,490
greatest stake in the world.
The Usda prime corn fed for taste.

2277
01:49:06,970 --> 01:49:08,870
Maybe it's good.
It's good restaurant.

2278
01:49:09,340 --> 01:49:10,840
Good story.
Good history,

2279
01:49:10,850 --> 01:49:13,870
great restaurants.
There are just a few months ago.

2280
01:49:13,900 --> 01:49:14,661
It's very good.
Yeah.

2281
01:49:14,661 --> 01:49:15,620
Very good.
Yeah.

2282
01:49:15,680 --> 01:49:16,640
But,
um,

2283
01:49:16,970 --> 01:49:19,100
but again,
it's a subjective thing,

2284
01:49:19,101 --> 01:49:19,934
right?
The flavor in terms of like what you 

2285
01:49:22,221 --> 01:49:25,390
actually look for.
And they as they were talking about like

2286
01:49:25,400 --> 01:49:28,580
your customers saying they're accustomed
to a certain type of meat.

2287
01:49:28,790 --> 01:49:31,730
Like they were saying that their 
customers are accustomed to this,

2288
01:49:31,880 --> 01:49:34,270
they're not interested in grass fed 
anything bad.

2289
01:49:34,280 --> 01:49:35,390
I understand that,
you know,

2290
01:49:35,420 --> 01:49:36,253
they've been doing that for a long time 
and grading that beef that way and I 

2291
01:49:38,031 --> 01:49:40,550
don't think they should change ever.
Not based on anything.

2292
01:49:40,580 --> 01:49:41,413
Right.
It's a great place where you get 

2293
01:49:42,081 --> 01:49:43,040
consistency.
I mean,

2294
01:49:43,041 --> 01:49:44,840
you go there,
you get this fantastic steak.

2295
01:49:44,841 --> 01:49:47,710
It's,
I mean it's so old world too and you get

2296
01:49:47,711 --> 01:49:48,401
in there that.
I mean,

2297
01:49:48,401 --> 01:49:49,810
how long has Peter Luger's been around 
for

2298
01:49:49,910 --> 01:49:50,690
God?
Forever.

2299
01:49:50,690 --> 01:49:51,523
Forever hundred.
Twenty years or something insane like 

2300
01:49:54,561 --> 01:49:55,740
that.
And they get the money.

2301
01:49:55,760 --> 01:49:56,593
Shit like that.
At my trial is very old steak 

2302
01:49:57,561 --> 01:49:58,394
restaurant.
Moishe's is a famous restaurant in 

2303
01:50:00,051 --> 01:50:01,320
Montreal and they,
you know,

2304
01:50:01,400 --> 01:50:02,233
they do have their beef program and they
should not change because there's new 

2305
01:50:04,671 --> 01:50:07,280
conversations happening.
He knows what he's doing.

2306
01:50:07,290 --> 01:50:09,910
Lenny lighter and he should do,
you know,

2307
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:12,320
keep on doing that in a small 
restaurant.

2308
01:50:12,321 --> 01:50:15,770
Let's say that fred marginal characters 
like Fred and I own,

2309
01:50:16,700 --> 01:50:21,700
I always see it like it's not a those 
restaurants maybe or public places.

2310
01:50:25,160 --> 01:50:28,460
My restaurant is my restaurant,
which I want to do what I want in.

2311
01:50:28,860 --> 01:50:29,693
Right.
It's not,

2312
01:50:29,740 --> 01:50:32,170
it's not at the.
I don't,

2313
01:50:32,210 --> 01:50:35,350
we don't listen so much to the public,
you know,

2314
01:50:35,351 --> 01:50:35,870
I,
I,

2315
01:50:35,870 --> 01:50:39,700
I serve at my pleasure.
Not the customer.

2316
01:50:39,720 --> 01:50:40,553
The customer is always right.
It's the customers often wrong and I'm 

2317
01:50:42,141 --> 01:50:45,150
always right because we can do salmon.
I play the music,

2318
01:50:45,151 --> 01:50:49,370
I want to serve the food we want to and 
I served the wines we want to and if you

2319
01:50:49,371 --> 01:50:50,600
don't like it,
you don't have to come.

2320
01:50:50,601 --> 01:50:53,150
It's our,
but it's this restaurant is for us.

2321
01:50:53,330 --> 01:50:54,163
That's one of the things that I learned 
from watching Bourdain's original show 

2322
01:50:57,111 --> 01:50:57,944
that no reservation show and that it 
changed my opinion on things because I 

2323
01:51:01,221 --> 01:51:03,530
didn't have a strong opinion on food 
before that.

2324
01:51:03,531 --> 01:51:04,364
Other than that I really liked it.
I didn't think of it as an art form and 

2325
01:51:08,781 --> 01:51:12,320
watching his show and seeing the passion
of his,

2326
01:51:12,380 --> 01:51:13,213
his appreciation for food and for the 
way it's the way it's grown and brought 

2327
01:51:18,531 --> 01:51:23,000
to the table and the production of it.
And then ultimately the flavor of it and

2328
01:51:23,001 --> 01:51:23,834
the taste.
And,

2329
01:51:24,040 --> 01:51:27,650
and his admiration for chefs and you 
guys as well,

2330
01:51:28,700 --> 01:51:29,980
his,
his advert,

2331
01:51:30,020 --> 01:51:30,853
his admiration for it and his,
his appreciation for the way 

2332
01:51:33,681 --> 01:51:35,870
everything's put together made me 
realize like,

2333
01:51:35,930 --> 01:51:37,100
oh,
this is an art form.

2334
01:51:37,450 --> 01:51:38,380
It's a craft.
And,

2335
01:51:38,381 --> 01:51:40,030
and you know,
Tony did something.

2336
01:51:40,840 --> 01:51:44,770
Tony was the most faithful,
most like we were so lucky to be on that

2337
01:51:44,771 --> 01:51:45,970
ship with him.
You know,

2338
01:51:46,300 --> 01:51:47,133
that he took us a board and you could 
see he had the same apprenticeship we 

2339
01:51:51,461 --> 01:51:52,294
did,
you know,

2340
01:51:52,310 --> 01:51:55,300
like suffering and like big bistro 
stroke kitchens and stuff.

2341
01:51:55,301 --> 01:51:58,060
And you think about it,
the guy,

2342
01:51:58,630 --> 01:51:59,463
he didn't make the promise to himself 
that when he'd get rich and famous he 

2343
01:52:02,321 --> 01:52:04,840
was going to buy a big house and not 
talk to people.

2344
01:52:05,440 --> 01:52:10,440
He helped every cook not walk out of the
kitchen and get famous but get a voice,

2345
01:52:11,610 --> 01:52:13,480
you know,
television show.

2346
01:52:13,481 --> 01:52:18,010
The work he did in private is not look 
like a dirty guy that makes the pasta in

2347
01:52:18,011 --> 01:52:18,671
the back.
You know,

2348
01:52:18,671 --> 01:52:19,990
all of a sudden it's like,
yeah,

2349
01:52:20,040 --> 01:52:22,000
the manager in the suit and the owners.

2350
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:26,490
But who's the guy in the back?
He had appreciation for everybody and he

2351
01:52:26,500 --> 01:52:30,440
had a real passion for the process and 
the marginal character is like,

2352
01:52:30,850 --> 01:52:31,683
there's lots of commercial restaurants 
in the city of Montreal in any given 

2353
01:52:34,601 --> 01:52:38,410
city of that he went to.
He was able to isolate,

2354
01:52:38,440 --> 01:52:39,273
let's say,
the marginal characters in every city 

2355
01:52:41,831 --> 01:52:43,330
that,
you know,

2356
01:52:43,331 --> 01:52:45,020
we're,
you know,

2357
01:52:45,160 --> 01:52:50,160
we're historically bound kind of Fred 
and I practice a weird faction of French

2358
01:52:50,451 --> 01:52:54,830
cooking called cuisine bourgeoise and 
only kind of Tony and a handful of other

2359
01:52:54,831 --> 01:52:57,710
guys couldn't look at what we do and go,
oh,

2360
01:52:57,711 --> 01:52:59,020
those fuckers,
they're,

2361
01:52:59,150 --> 01:53:01,420
they're up to that.
No one.

2362
01:53:02,820 --> 01:53:05,050
He goes,
you guys are the only people,

2363
01:53:05,270 --> 01:53:07,430
the last of the Mohicans that do this 
kind of food.

2364
01:53:08,150 --> 01:53:08,530
I mean,
no.

2365
01:53:08,530 --> 01:53:10,280
Yeah,
know we can't stop.

2366
01:53:10,340 --> 01:53:13,280
We got to keep on with what a great guy 
to get it to.

2367
01:53:13,990 --> 01:53:15,650
Yeah.
Because nobody does,

2368
01:53:15,680 --> 01:53:17,400
right.
Nobody understands.

2369
01:53:17,480 --> 01:53:20,360
Like,
you know the rabbit hole where down Tony

2370
01:53:20,361 --> 01:53:21,194
did the.

2371
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:23,233
Yeah,
he,

2372
01:53:24,100 --> 01:53:24,933
he,
he,

2373
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:30,000
he really did a deeply influenced my 
appreciation for food in the way I think

2374
01:53:30,111 --> 01:53:32,660
about it.
And again,

2375
01:53:33,410 --> 01:53:34,243
treating it as an art form,
which I just thought it was just 

2376
01:53:35,751 --> 01:53:37,250
delicious.
I didn't think of it as like,

2377
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:39,590
oh,
these guys are making temporary art.

2378
01:53:39,950 --> 01:53:41,030
They're making art.
You're going to,

2379
01:53:41,060 --> 01:53:43,560
you're going to enjoy.
Now you know you're,

2380
01:53:43,570 --> 01:53:44,041
you're,
you're,

2381
01:53:44,041 --> 01:53:46,700
you can't put it on film.
I mean you can,

2382
01:53:46,730 --> 01:53:47,563
but you're not going to get it all.
You're just gonna want to go out and 

2383
01:53:49,071 --> 01:53:49,904
experience it.

2384
01:53:49,970 --> 01:53:50,803
Yeah.
Ultimately food is you can't we go and 

2385
01:53:52,611 --> 01:53:55,610
do like we were asked to do like 
demonstrations,

2386
01:53:55,611 --> 01:53:57,150
you know,
you can go on a big stage.

2387
01:53:57,151 --> 01:53:57,984
It's 5,000
people to talk about food or make like 

2388
01:54:00,260 --> 01:54:02,480
little crackers with smoked salmon 
onstage.

2389
01:54:02,630 --> 01:54:04,360
Food is not fit for a stage.
No.

2390
01:54:04,460 --> 01:54:07,360
Food is for a table for us to enjoy it 
with a fork and knife.

2391
01:54:07,370 --> 01:54:10,130
We talk about it and go hunting.
That's what food is.

2392
01:54:10,190 --> 01:54:13,640
Paypal offers food shows all the time 
and it doesn't work.

2393
01:54:14,300 --> 01:54:15,440
What's the concept?
Well,

2394
01:54:15,441 --> 01:54:16,274
you guys can be in a pickup truck and 
you go and visit your suppliers and 

2395
01:54:19,101 --> 01:54:20,930
maybe I have a bottle of wine with them 
after.

2396
01:54:20,931 --> 01:54:21,800
I was like,
dude,

2397
01:54:22,580 --> 01:54:27,580
like we worked hard not to copy or 
fellow,

2398
01:54:28,820 --> 01:54:30,380
you know,
culinarians.

2399
01:54:30,470 --> 01:54:31,303
Yeah.
You look at TV producers are out there 

2400
01:54:33,771 --> 01:54:38,771
just like blatantly proposing the 
previous show to you again.

2401
01:54:39,610 --> 01:54:40,443
Well that's one of the things

2402
01:54:40,460 --> 01:54:44,260
right after anthony died,
there was some talk about,

2403
01:54:44,820 --> 01:54:45,360
oh

2404
01:54:45,360 --> 01:54:50,360
Hugh Ramsay doing some very similar show
in the outcry against it was enormous.

2405
01:54:52,030 --> 01:54:54,130
I mean he was just getting assaulted 
online.

2406
01:54:54,150 --> 01:54:55,390
I mean it was crazy

2407
01:54:55,650 --> 01:54:56,483
that everybody that I was talking to our
agents who represents us for our book 

2408
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:04,740
and she was saying like,
it was the same.

2409
01:55:05,060 --> 01:55:05,893
All the big production companies are 
being paraded by people pitching who is 

2410
01:55:14,190 --> 01:55:15,690
going to be the next Tony,
right.

2411
01:55:15,800 --> 01:55:17,030
You know,
I don't want to say that,

2412
01:55:17,630 --> 01:55:21,170
but one of the character and you guys 
you could take over.

2413
01:55:22,330 --> 01:55:24,480
Yeah,
you could do it because you guys track,

2414
01:55:24,590 --> 01:55:25,423
you know,
the way it went in West Virginia and it 

2415
01:55:26,571 --> 01:55:30,410
wasn't like Republican or Democrat.
Like he went to places.

2416
01:55:30,430 --> 01:55:32,660
He's like,
yeah sure I have my views,

2417
01:55:32,661 --> 01:55:34,430
but let's break bread.
You know.

2418
01:55:34,730 --> 01:55:38,780
And I always said that like,
all our countries are divided on issues,

2419
01:55:38,781 --> 01:55:43,290
but they're nobody that overlaps them 
with a coherent vision.

2420
01:55:43,410 --> 01:55:43,980
Everybody

2421
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:48,360
loves each other when there's delicious 
food on the table that and guys like you

2422
01:55:48,390 --> 01:55:49,223
with like a clear view and irrational 
and science based and evidence based 

2423
01:55:53,520 --> 01:55:58,520
view on things.
And like Tony just have such a voice now

2424
01:55:58,980 --> 01:56:02,820
in our countries that it's.
I could see you doing a food show.

2425
01:56:03,740 --> 01:56:06,030
I love food,
but I don't,

2426
01:56:06,120 --> 01:56:06,953
I'll never do a food show and I just 
can't imagine not because you ask 

2427
01:56:10,890 --> 01:56:12,990
questions.
I like doing show.

2428
01:56:13,030 --> 01:56:16,050
I mean I love having guys like you on 
and talking about food,

2429
01:56:16,051 --> 01:56:21,051
but it takes a special type of person to
want to travel 300 days a year,

2430
01:56:22,500 --> 01:56:23,333
you know,
and that's essentially what Tony was 

2431
01:56:24,451 --> 01:56:26,940
doing.
And I think that has a massive toll.

2432
01:56:27,240 --> 01:56:27,890
Um,
it,

2433
01:56:27,890 --> 01:56:28,723
it takes a massive toll on your body.
It takes a massive toll on your psyche 

2434
01:56:32,910 --> 01:56:35,310
family everyday.
It's not healthy.

2435
01:56:35,400 --> 01:56:36,233
I know there's not enough Melatonin or 
like cbd or the lenses to help you with 

2436
01:56:42,571 --> 01:56:43,050
that.

2437
01:56:43,050 --> 01:56:46,260
I traveled more than enough already and 
I've cut my traveling way back.

2438
01:56:46,261 --> 01:56:49,050
I'm down to only 10.
UFC is a year now,

2439
01:56:49,350 --> 01:56:50,660
and I do,
you know,

2440
01:56:50,970 --> 01:56:53,770
comedy around that and stand up comedy.
But I,

2441
01:56:53,771 --> 01:56:54,604
I consciously make the effort to travel 
much less because I just don't think 

2442
01:56:58,591 --> 01:57:00,510
it's good.
I just don't think it's good for you.

2443
01:57:00,930 --> 01:57:04,410
And um,
and also that road life,

2444
01:57:04,740 --> 01:57:05,191
you know,
the,

2445
01:57:05,191 --> 01:57:06,024
the drinking and all that other stuff 
that comes with it that accentuates all 

2446
01:57:08,431 --> 01:57:09,840
the problems that you have with,
uh,

2447
01:57:09,860 --> 01:57:10,693
with travel.
And I think that's also one of the 

2448
01:57:12,391 --> 01:57:13,330
things that,
um,

2449
01:57:13,790 --> 01:57:14,623
was,
was dragging tony down when he would 

2450
01:57:16,201 --> 01:57:19,830
talk about the sadness and the 
loneliness of being on the road.

2451
01:57:19,831 --> 01:57:23,400
I can't help but from knowing him and 
partying with him,

2452
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:24,593
I can't help but the thought that a lot 
of that was probably accentuated by the 

2453
01:57:27,631 --> 01:57:28,464
alcohol consumption and you know,
and you guys could speak to that now 

2454
01:57:31,861 --> 01:57:32,694
that you're,
you're,

2455
01:57:32,740 --> 01:57:35,040
you're clean and you're not experiencing
the,

2456
01:57:35,070 --> 01:57:37,260
those rugged hangovers every morning.

2457
01:57:37,390 --> 01:57:38,910
I always,
always worried for Tony that way.

2458
01:57:38,911 --> 01:57:41,490
Just so you know,
the hotel,

2459
01:57:41,491 --> 01:57:45,540
living planes,
trains and automobiles constantly and it

2460
01:57:45,541 --> 01:57:47,360
wasn't like for a year it was like,
Hey,

2461
01:57:47,630 --> 01:57:48,463
well years,
sad life if the watch river monsters at 

2462
01:57:51,450 --> 01:57:52,283
11 in the morning,
burping Jamison and I'm referring to 

2463
01:57:55,051 --> 01:58:00,051
many occasions in our life where like 
you're traveling in a hotel room and you

2464
01:58:00,730 --> 01:58:03,160
were in a beautiful place,
but like just,

2465
01:58:03,470 --> 01:58:05,820
you feel weird.
Yeah,

2466
01:58:05,960 --> 01:58:06,793
I've,
I've taken steps to mitigate some of 

2467
01:58:08,041 --> 01:58:08,874
that.
One of the big ones is I travel with 

2468
01:58:09,841 --> 01:58:10,674
friends.
I'm bring really good comics to work 

2469
01:58:13,141 --> 01:58:15,840
with me on the road so that when I'm in 
these cities,

2470
01:58:15,841 --> 01:58:17,670
I'm in these cities with friends and we 
just go.

2471
01:58:17,671 --> 01:58:19,830
It's like they're family.
So we go,

2472
01:58:19,831 --> 01:58:22,140
we'll go eat together,
we'll go work out together,

2473
01:58:22,530 --> 01:58:23,363
you know,
and try to keep the unhealthy shit to a 

2474
01:58:24,871 --> 01:58:25,704
minimum.
Plus I'm more of a marijuana 

2475
01:58:27,091 --> 01:58:29,160
enthusiastic than I am a drinker.
Anyway.

2476
01:58:29,270 --> 01:58:32,280
It's legal and back now we stores in the
entire country,

2477
01:58:32,340 --> 01:58:35,370
Canada as well in America.
They're connected as usual.

2478
01:58:35,371 --> 01:58:37,650
We got a little bit the special 
treatment,

2479
01:58:37,990 --> 01:58:39,750
you know,
they're everywhere else in French.

2480
01:58:39,930 --> 01:58:42,070
Then on top of yet you

2481
01:58:42,070 --> 01:58:43,720
can't grow,
what do you call it,

2482
01:58:43,900 --> 01:58:46,210
in cannabis?
Cannabis.

2483
01:58:46,600 --> 01:58:48,070
You can't grow,
can't grow,

2484
01:58:48,550 --> 01:58:53,410
and you have to only consume the 
government's going grow anyway.

2485
01:58:53,411 --> 01:58:56,080
I'm not worried about that government.
So you know what they did,

2486
01:58:56,081 --> 01:58:56,561
right?
Yeah.

2487
01:58:56,561 --> 01:58:57,330
It's like a,
you know,

2488
01:58:57,330 --> 01:58:58,163
we have a monopoly liquor board,
so we have like storage or commissioner 

2489
01:59:02,030 --> 01:59:04,510
commissioner.
Now we have the cannabis commission.

2490
01:59:04,511 --> 01:59:05,344
So what they did,
it got legal and October 17th at 

2491
01:59:07,811 --> 01:59:11,570
midnight.
The stores we're opening October 17th at

2492
01:59:11,600 --> 01:59:12,433
10 in the morning.
The cops were giving tickets to people 

2493
01:59:14,921 --> 01:59:15,754
smoking weed during that little layover 
time because they knew that it was 

2494
01:59:20,471 --> 01:59:22,210
impossible.
They bought it legally.

2495
01:59:22,600 --> 01:59:25,330
So some people get ticketed for smoking.
Illegal.

2496
01:59:25,331 --> 01:59:29,110
We'd align it for legal weed.
Oh God.

2497
01:59:29,111 --> 01:59:30,390
What a bunch of asks.
Hey,

2498
01:59:30,430 --> 01:59:33,610
we just drank the Koolaid on that one.
I think you know,

2499
01:59:33,950 --> 01:59:36,250
but it's good.
We'll put more money into Medicare.

2500
01:59:36,590 --> 01:59:37,423
Well,
I think

2501
01:59:37,770 --> 01:59:38,603
ultimately lead to relaxing of people's 
opinions and ideas about marijuana and 

2502
01:59:41,971 --> 01:59:44,940
what it is,
but I also think that marijuana,

2503
01:59:44,941 --> 01:59:45,774
just like alcohol can be used as a 
crutch and it could eventually overcome 

2504
01:59:48,961 --> 01:59:50,340
your life.
I like it,

2505
01:59:50,341 --> 01:59:51,540
but I like it.
I like it.

2506
01:59:51,541 --> 01:59:52,890
Uh,
every now and again,

2507
01:59:52,950 --> 01:59:53,783
you know,
and one of the things that came out of 

2508
01:59:55,171 --> 01:59:56,004
last year,
sober October was taking a whole month 

2509
01:59:58,470 --> 01:59:59,910
off of it,
realizing that hey,

2510
01:59:59,911 --> 02:00:01,500
I don't need it.
I can,

2511
02:00:01,560 --> 02:00:02,393
I can function fine without it,
but it made me more apprehensive about 

2512
02:00:06,451 --> 02:00:09,510
regular use.
Like instead of using it every day,

2513
02:00:09,511 --> 02:00:10,344
I'll use it a day,
a week or two days a week or something 

2514
02:00:11,911 --> 02:00:12,744
like that.
And I,

2515
02:00:12,810 --> 02:00:14,730
and I appreciate it more when it does 
happen,

2516
02:00:14,731 --> 02:00:15,564
when,
when I do get high with my friends on 

2517
02:00:17,220 --> 02:00:21,110
Friday night or something like that,
it's like it means something like we're,

2518
02:00:21,300 --> 02:00:23,010
we're,
it's almost like a sacrament.

2519
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:26,970
Like we're experiencing a little moment 
together and just having fun.

2520
02:00:27,210 --> 02:00:29,910
That's the proof though.
What you just said is the proof that you

2521
02:00:29,911 --> 02:00:31,530
don't have addiction issues.
You see,

2522
02:00:32,160 --> 02:00:32,993
I couldn't be able to prove that I 
smoked marijuana responsibly once in my 

2523
02:00:38,761 --> 02:00:42,000
life that I drank alcohol once in my 
life that you know,

2524
02:00:42,001 --> 02:00:46,080
that I did drugs responsibly,
so I'm fascinated by brought some,

2525
02:00:46,590 --> 02:00:47,423
some of our cooks that were here in la 
with us to a restaurant and we had a 

2526
02:00:50,971 --> 02:00:51,804
beautiful dinner and I ordered them a 
bottle of wine and they barely finished 

2527
02:00:55,561 --> 02:01:00,350
it and I didn't understand the first 
bottle of wine.

2528
02:01:00,420 --> 02:01:01,253
I was like,
what do you guys want more as I think I 

2529
02:01:04,570 --> 02:01:08,550
would've paid for nine and they had one 
and I was just sitting there.

2530
02:01:08,551 --> 02:01:09,450
I told Fred,
I go,

2531
02:01:09,900 --> 02:01:10,733
I don't really.
What is it like to be in that 

2532
02:01:12,061 --> 02:01:14,430
environment and watching people glass 
over,

2533
02:01:14,580 --> 02:01:19,580
like see,
see the drunk we use.

2534
02:01:19,830 --> 02:01:23,130
We say that all the time.
We used to think that like everybody was

2535
02:01:23,131 --> 02:01:24,030
drunk.
It was smashed.

2536
02:01:24,180 --> 02:01:25,013
No,
there was only me was like the beer 

2537
02:01:28,291 --> 02:01:29,124
goggles in it with everybody realized 
now that like everybody at the 

2538
02:01:33,481 --> 02:01:38,481
restaurants generally like nine out of 
10 times drink quite responsibly.

2539
02:01:40,490 --> 02:01:41,323
Otherwise it'd be just accidents 
everywhere in violence everywhere you 

2540
02:01:43,341 --> 02:01:44,470
turn right?
Yeah,

2541
02:01:44,570 --> 02:01:47,810
and I realize a lot of the people that 
I'm friends with drink responsibly,

2542
02:01:47,811 --> 02:01:49,550
they can have a glass of wine with 
lunch.

2543
02:01:50,470 --> 02:01:51,303
Uh,
me and fred opened a bottle of wine at 

2544
02:01:53,391 --> 02:01:56,410
lunch.
We go til 10:30

2545
02:01:56,411 --> 02:01:58,520
until we couldn't it anymore.
And then that was it.

2546
02:01:58,550 --> 02:01:59,900
You know,
we,

2547
02:01:59,980 --> 02:02:01,520
we,
we did last time we came to La,

2548
02:02:01,521 --> 02:02:03,320
we did a hell's kitchen.
Okay.

2549
02:02:03,321 --> 02:02:06,680
We're judged for showing ostriches who's
disgusting?

2550
02:02:06,830 --> 02:02:11,830
Ostriches Burger before mutual fund 
rutgers as ostrich Burger.

2551
02:02:12,591 --> 02:02:14,750
It's actually delicious.
It's really bloody right.

2552
02:02:15,360 --> 02:02:18,440
And there's that thing for a cooking 
shows like that.

2553
02:02:19,280 --> 02:02:20,113
It's regulated by the Gaming Commission,
so they have to keep the camera rolling 

2554
02:02:23,570 --> 02:02:24,403
and they're not allowed to touch the 
dishes because they are the object of 

2555
02:02:26,751 --> 02:02:29,150
the competition.
So you take your break,

2556
02:02:29,151 --> 02:02:30,600
you go to the green room,
your way,

2557
02:02:30,601 --> 02:02:34,670
they're cleaning up the kitchen now.
The food sits on the past there like for

2558
02:02:34,671 --> 02:02:38,510
two hours and you come back,
you sit at a table and there's like rare

2559
02:02:38,570 --> 02:02:41,420
ostrich vendor line that's been sitting 
for two hours.

2560
02:02:41,870 --> 02:02:44,870
Then they just post cook.
Yeah.

2561
02:02:45,050 --> 02:02:49,070
Yeah.
And you have to judge like,

2562
02:02:49,071 --> 02:02:49,760
wait a minute,
you,

2563
02:02:49,760 --> 02:02:51,970
you're judging food that was cooked two 
hours ago.

2564
02:02:52,040 --> 02:02:53,840
TV.
That's so fucking.

2565
02:02:54,150 --> 02:02:57,710
And I felt like,
again that's insulting for,

2566
02:02:57,920 --> 02:02:59,390
for guys like,
you know.

2567
02:02:59,391 --> 02:03:00,224
But the thing is like if I felt so bad 
because there's people who put a job on 

2568
02:03:03,291 --> 02:03:05,030
hold,
they left their kids at home.

2569
02:03:05,050 --> 02:03:07,670
They made it.
I'm in the casting.

2570
02:03:07,790 --> 02:03:08,623
I was selected to be part of the kitchen
and then we say something in that 

2571
02:03:13,791 --> 02:03:14,331
regard.
It's good.

2572
02:03:14,331 --> 02:03:15,350
I hate us right now,
right?

2573
02:03:15,370 --> 02:03:16,430
No,
the show's great.

2574
02:03:16,880 --> 02:03:21,880
But I felt like I felt sad.
But that's all that to say that whenever

2575
02:03:22,071 --> 02:03:24,260
we came we stayed by the airport.
You know,

2576
02:03:24,270 --> 02:03:25,700
we,
we stayed at a.

2577
02:03:26,150 --> 02:03:28,100
just so you can get into their quick 
frozen.

2578
02:03:28,101 --> 02:03:31,970
Margarita is at the hotel bar.
11 o'clock.

2579
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:35,380
We're into a whirlpool at the radisson.
Radison Ortho.

2580
02:03:35,730 --> 02:03:38,720
So sad.
Having cocktails and encounters,

2581
02:03:39,140 --> 02:03:41,390
that hotel life can be fucking sad,
man.

2582
02:03:41,480 --> 02:03:42,320
I know.
I get it.

2583
02:03:42,321 --> 02:03:43,154
It's like.
And now we're like completely not 

2584
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:45,793
drinking.
They got us a room and we're staying at 

2585
02:03:47,061 --> 02:03:50,060
the chateau and I never did.
I never thought it stay there.

2586
02:03:50,061 --> 02:03:53,420
I would really love to get drunk at the 
Chateau Marmont you did once,

2587
02:03:53,421 --> 02:03:54,380
but not this time.

2588
02:03:54,440 --> 02:03:55,760
But yeah,
that's like a spot,

2589
02:03:55,860 --> 02:03:57,140
you know,
I've been here forever.

2590
02:03:57,141 --> 02:03:59,300
I've never even gone in that building.
It's beautiful.

2591
02:03:59,510 --> 02:04:01,280
Maybe it did once.
I might have.

2592
02:04:01,530 --> 02:04:04,580
I think it was there once for like a TV 
thing that I had to do,

2593
02:04:04,820 --> 02:04:07,910
like a one of those party things in like
the nineties.

2594
02:04:08,210 --> 02:04:09,043
I think I went once.
It's funny because there's like really 

2595
02:04:11,091 --> 02:04:11,601
like,
you know,

2596
02:04:11,601 --> 02:04:15,530
like be list Hollywood stars,
like hanging out at the pool,

2597
02:04:15,560 --> 02:04:19,890
drinking champagne cocktails,
trying to be cool smoking blunts and try

2598
02:04:19,891 --> 02:04:21,770
to pick up girls.
Tony used to stay.

2599
02:04:22,030 --> 02:04:23,870
He said get a villa there.
When he was writing,

2600
02:04:23,871 --> 02:04:25,790
he used to stay there.
He told me he loved it.

2601
02:04:26,150 --> 02:04:28,310
He just loved everything about the feel 
of it.

2602
02:04:28,340 --> 02:04:29,173
The whole,
the dirtiness of the Raleigh hotel with 

2603
02:04:31,491 --> 02:04:33,280
him in Miami.
He loved that place too.

2604
02:04:33,590 --> 02:04:35,820
Dirty spots.
Other Raleigh was fun.

2605
02:04:35,980 --> 02:04:37,410
That that's how Tony was,
you know,

2606
02:04:37,420 --> 02:04:38,220
he's like

2607
02:04:38,220 --> 02:04:40,020
guys,
I like old food like you do.

2608
02:04:40,021 --> 02:04:44,310
What if we do a dinner based on like a 
old transatlantic ship,

2609
02:04:44,870 --> 02:04:46,620
like boats,
like dining room.

2610
02:04:47,810 --> 02:04:50,340
So we get repaired,
repair,

2611
02:04:50,390 --> 02:04:51,810
Daniele Ballou bunch of guys.
He's like,

2612
02:04:51,811 --> 02:04:52,950
Ah,
put you up at the Raleigh.

2613
02:04:52,951 --> 02:04:56,850
We're just gonna do that one dinner,
but we're just gonna hang out for a week

2614
02:04:56,851 --> 02:04:57,684
after you.
And we're in the pool and the pool 

2615
02:04:59,011 --> 02:04:59,844
everyday making cigarettes.
Ottavia was like there with a kid and a 

2616
02:05:03,031 --> 02:05:06,690
rash guard all the time.
We went through a Cyborg,

2617
02:05:07,170 --> 02:05:08,003
Roberto Abreu.
We went to school there and I was just 

2618
02:05:10,411 --> 02:05:13,950
like,
starting in killer sister.

2619
02:05:14,130 --> 02:05:15,780
How long have you been doing Jujitsu 
now?

2620
02:05:16,470 --> 02:05:19,310
I did it for a year.
Solid and I stopped because a,

2621
02:05:19,320 --> 02:05:21,150
at a back surgery.
Oh,

2622
02:05:21,151 --> 02:05:22,250
disks?
Yeah.

2623
02:05:22,400 --> 02:05:23,000
Yeah.
What,

2624
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:24,450
what's uh,
what's going on?

2625
02:05:24,840 --> 02:05:27,410
It's totally fixed,
but I keep a towel.

2626
02:05:27,420 --> 02:05:28,380
So,
surgery,

2627
02:05:28,560 --> 02:05:30,180
what did you have wrong?
Uh,

2628
02:05:30,181 --> 02:05:31,440
it was um,
uh,

2629
02:05:31,640 --> 02:05:36,130
stenos shortening of the disc.
Yeah.

2630
02:05:36,131 --> 02:05:39,650
And then compression and then they,
they went in and chip some parts out.

2631
02:05:39,720 --> 02:05:40,553
[inaudible]

2632
02:05:41,820 --> 02:05:42,653
in retrospect.
And I spoke to some rheumatologists and 

2633
02:05:44,791 --> 02:05:46,230
it's interesting you're talking about 
like,

2634
02:05:46,231 --> 02:05:47,064
um,
Jordan Peterson because the auto immune 

2635
02:05:49,381 --> 02:05:52,090
thing can be everywhere,
right?

2636
02:05:52,380 --> 02:05:53,213
And now the doctor says like maybe 
Celiac caused the inflammation and so 

2637
02:05:56,821 --> 02:05:58,950
many places,
that's what I would say and all that,

2638
02:05:58,970 --> 02:06:03,180
like maybe the drinking to the 
inclination towards abuse,

2639
02:06:03,540 --> 02:06:05,910
you know,
this inclination towards depression,

2640
02:06:05,940 --> 02:06:08,640
this back problem,
this,

2641
02:06:08,670 --> 02:06:10,920
it's all related to that.
And again,

2642
02:06:10,950 --> 02:06:13,380
the proof is in the pudding.
I don't eat bread,

2643
02:06:13,381 --> 02:06:14,214
I don't eat sweets very little.
I mostly meet and I feel 100 times 

2644
02:06:19,171 --> 02:06:20,004
better.
I don't give a fuck if fits in my head 

2645
02:06:23,220 --> 02:06:25,140
for sober now.
Four months,

2646
02:06:25,320 --> 02:06:26,760
five months.
Well,

2647
02:06:26,761 --> 02:06:29,970
so it works.
I don't think that it's in your head,

2648
02:06:30,200 --> 02:06:34,380
but it's definitely been proven that all
those foods cause inflammation.

2649
02:06:34,680 --> 02:06:35,513
But I do think that Jujitsu in 
particular is ruthless on your back 

2650
02:06:39,020 --> 02:06:40,170
because of the torsions.

2651
02:06:40,460 --> 02:06:41,260
Well,
it's just,

2652
02:06:41,260 --> 02:06:42,880
you know,
big people on top of you.

2653
02:06:42,881 --> 02:06:44,760
You're yanking them around,
you're moving it back.

2654
02:06:44,761 --> 02:06:47,700
And very and very few people strengthen 
their back.

2655
02:06:47,750 --> 02:06:49,050
That's a,
that's a big issue.

2656
02:06:49,051 --> 02:06:49,884
And after we're done here,
I'm going to take you into my gym and 

2657
02:06:51,161 --> 02:06:51,994
I'm going to show you some machines that
I bought specifically to strengthen my 

2658
02:06:54,571 --> 02:06:56,700
back.
I've had some disc issues too,

2659
02:06:56,760 --> 02:07:01,140
and the doctors are pretty adamant about
putting me under the knife.

2660
02:07:01,410 --> 02:07:02,160
And,
uh,

2661
02:07:02,160 --> 02:07:04,890
I,
I just didn't like the idea of it.

2662
02:07:04,891 --> 02:07:07,800
I've had many surgeries.
I've had both my knees reconstructed.

2663
02:07:08,250 --> 02:07:10,440
I know when you need surgery,
when you don't.

2664
02:07:10,650 --> 02:07:11,483
And the more I looked into it,
the more I realize that there's doctors 

2665
02:07:14,761 --> 02:07:18,870
that they have a hammer.
So everything's a nail that's a nail.

2666
02:07:18,871 --> 02:07:21,030
Let me just fucking whack that thing.
They're not like,

2667
02:07:21,060 --> 02:07:21,893
oh,
you're going to have to change your 

2668
02:07:22,651 --> 02:07:23,484
diet.
You're going to have to lose some 

2669
02:07:24,271 --> 02:07:25,680
weight.
You're going to have to strengthen those

2670
02:07:25,681 --> 02:07:29,520
muscles around your back.
And if you do do that,

2671
02:07:29,521 --> 02:07:32,820
I find that the results are superior in 
many cases.

2672
02:07:33,070 --> 02:07:36,280
It's a combination like yoga works 
wonderfully for testing.

2673
02:07:36,330 --> 02:07:38,270
Yoga.
Decompression of the spine is,

2674
02:07:38,290 --> 02:07:40,770
is critical because you're always 
compressing.

2675
02:07:40,771 --> 02:07:41,311
You always like,
well,

2676
02:07:41,311 --> 02:07:42,144
these chairs,
we're sitting in these chairs from a 

2677
02:07:44,061 --> 02:07:47,010
company called fully and they're called 
capisce co's.

2678
02:07:47,070 --> 02:07:48,730
And these are Ergonomic chairs,
you know,

2679
02:07:48,740 --> 02:07:49,573
as we've been sitting in this place,
it's two and a half hours in the 

2680
02:07:51,211 --> 02:07:52,320
podcast.
Now we don't,

2681
02:07:52,350 --> 02:07:55,800
our backs aren't hurting.
They feel good too.

2682
02:07:56,010 --> 02:07:56,843
They're comfortable as like.
So I knew there was a solution how to 

2683
02:07:59,671 --> 02:08:01,080
find the solution.
Luckily this,

2684
02:08:01,270 --> 02:08:03,900
this company contacted me and sent us 
these chairs.

2685
02:08:03,930 --> 02:08:04,763
This is what we needed.
I try to fucking shitload of chairs 

2686
02:08:06,301 --> 02:08:07,134
before that.
But it was the same thing with the 

2687
02:08:07,760 --> 02:08:10,170
exercises.
I knew there was a solution.

2688
02:08:10,350 --> 02:08:12,900
I had to figure out what it was.
I tried decompression.

2689
02:08:12,901 --> 02:08:15,240
I tried a bunch of different forms of 
decompression.

2690
02:08:15,241 --> 02:08:17,350
I figured out the best ones,
you know,

2691
02:08:17,370 --> 02:08:18,330
I have those,
um,

2692
02:08:18,660 --> 02:08:22,430
those things are the way you hang by 
your ankle.

2693
02:08:24,660 --> 02:08:26,220
What the fuck is the name of that 
company?

2694
02:08:26,820 --> 02:08:29,970
Hooks known the upside down thing.
God Damn it.

2695
02:08:29,971 --> 02:08:32,010
They're a sponsor of the podcast.
Sex swings.

2696
02:08:32,050 --> 02:08:34,290
Teeter totter.
Teeter makes those like,

2697
02:08:34,291 --> 02:08:36,570
just relaxing in those.
We have one back there.

2698
02:08:36,571 --> 02:08:39,720
You clamp your ankles in,
just collect that back.

2699
02:08:39,721 --> 02:08:40,554
Just stretch out again.
And then there's a bunch of different 

2700
02:08:42,181 --> 02:08:45,210
exercise that I do with yoga this 
stretcher back out as well.

2701
02:08:45,390 --> 02:08:47,340
We're in a constant state of 
compression,

2702
02:08:47,341 --> 02:08:48,960
right?
Constant gravity,

2703
02:08:49,110 --> 02:08:51,180
constant pushing you down.
And a guy like me,

2704
02:08:51,181 --> 02:08:56,181
I'm always lifting weights to some.
You've got these heavy is pushing up and

2705
02:08:56,970 --> 02:08:59,130
got up,
got to spend as much time.

2706
02:08:59,131 --> 02:09:01,590
But we'll lengthening as you do pushing 
down.

2707
02:09:01,830 --> 02:09:05,100
And you also have to stretch everything 
out because the more your hamstrings are

2708
02:09:05,520 --> 02:09:07,650
tight,
it's going to pull down on your back.

2709
02:09:07,830 --> 02:09:11,850
A lot of people that have back pains,
it's a connected feet.

2710
02:09:11,851 --> 02:09:13,920
Dangling tight hamstrings.
Yeah.

2711
02:09:14,040 --> 02:09:18,850
I have a theory through the.
Like a lot of things starts in school,

2712
02:09:18,851 --> 02:09:20,290
you know,
because you look at kids.

2713
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,290
I have two boys and one daughter,
you know Henry,

2714
02:09:23,320 --> 02:09:26,650
Ivan and Eleanor and they five,
seven,

2715
02:09:26,651 --> 02:09:28,330
nine.
They can do monkey bars,

2716
02:09:28,380 --> 02:09:29,680
pull ups,
muscle ups,

2717
02:09:29,770 --> 02:09:31,990
you know like they do judo,
they play hockey.

2718
02:09:31,991 --> 02:09:34,540
They're very active.
But school,

2719
02:09:34,930 --> 02:09:38,950
the way that physically a classroom is 
designed is wrong.

2720
02:09:39,400 --> 02:09:40,233
It's like putting them in a cast for the
next 15 years and then they're going to 

2721
02:09:43,241 --> 02:09:46,120
come out of high school.
Like I was unable to climb a rope.

2722
02:09:46,150 --> 02:09:49,390
I'm able to do monkey bars,
unable to do anything right.

2723
02:09:49,391 --> 02:09:52,810
And then they're going to go through 
more school and sit down for more times,

2724
02:09:52,830 --> 02:09:53,663
you know,
so they don't get enough physical 

2725
02:09:54,581 --> 02:09:56,310
activity and not even close.
No,

2726
02:09:56,370 --> 02:09:59,800
not even the education towards it.
Not even the education nutricia yeah.

2727
02:10:00,020 --> 02:10:05,020
And they get graded and evaluated on how
well they listened in gym class,

2728
02:10:06,130 --> 02:10:07,420
which is completely insane.

2729
02:10:07,490 --> 02:10:08,510
Yeah,
it really is.

2730
02:10:08,511 --> 02:10:13,310
I mean it was just making them sit down 
for all that time during the day.

2731
02:10:13,311 --> 02:10:14,144
We're just preparing them for some job 
that's going to be a natural in the 

2732
02:10:15,921 --> 02:10:16,754
first place.

2733
02:10:16,920 --> 02:10:20,910
Good little taxpayers and look,
look at it too.

2734
02:10:21,200 --> 02:10:24,480
That's a model of school that was based 
on like religious schools,

2735
02:10:24,540 --> 02:10:25,320
you know,
and,

2736
02:10:25,320 --> 02:10:28,080
and like old Catholic schools,
let's say in Quebec.

2737
02:10:28,500 --> 02:10:31,860
How did you keep them from being 
distracted?

2738
02:10:32,250 --> 02:10:33,090
You know,
the ruler,

2739
02:10:33,200 --> 02:10:34,033
the fingers.
You go to the corner of the leather 

2740
02:10:35,121 --> 02:10:38,030
strap now we haven't changed the 
classroom,

2741
02:10:38,390 --> 02:10:42,600
the schedule and the curriculum barely,
but there's no more straps,

2742
02:10:42,601 --> 02:10:43,310
so like,
okay,

2743
02:10:43,310 --> 02:10:44,143
we haven't changed anything.
Like it's normal that it particularly 

2744
02:10:47,391 --> 02:10:50,270
little boys don't listen in school that 
well.

2745
02:10:51,020 --> 02:10:55,160
We have to find a way.
We have to redesign school from like the

2746
02:10:55,161 --> 02:10:57,020
schedule,
the design of the classroom,

2747
02:10:57,030 --> 02:10:58,670
the hallways,
the introduction,

2748
02:10:59,240 --> 02:11:00,073
you know,
like we have to bring restaurants back 

2749
02:11:01,941 --> 02:11:04,290
into school cafeteria and all that.
No,

2750
02:11:04,300 --> 02:11:05,133
it like cafeteria is and I don't know if
it's you the talk with Jeff Bridges 

2751
02:11:08,511 --> 02:11:09,344
about that because he's in the school 
lunches thing and the problem with 

2752
02:11:11,871 --> 02:11:12,704
school lunches is that if you subsidize 
half the kids then you have a kid with 

2753
02:11:16,551 --> 02:11:19,760
like a badge here that says like poor,
you know?

2754
02:11:20,420 --> 02:11:25,420
So the only way to do that then I know 
some people are a bit anti socialist,

2755
02:11:25,521 --> 02:11:27,340
but you have to feed all the kids.
Right?

2756
02:11:27,350 --> 02:11:28,460
It's crucial.

2757
02:11:28,510 --> 02:11:31,360
I mean the idea that that's a problem.
I mean Jesus Christ,

2758
02:11:31,361 --> 02:11:32,194
we're talking about food and also the 
sense of community that's established 

2759
02:11:35,111 --> 02:11:36,670
when everybody eats together.
You're gonna,

2760
02:11:36,910 --> 02:11:37,743
you're gonna,
you're gonna create this rift between 

2761
02:11:40,210 --> 02:11:44,620
students where you establish that one 
student is poor than the other ones just

2762
02:11:44,621 --> 02:11:47,410
going to fuck them up already,
you know it's going to already make them

2763
02:11:47,411 --> 02:11:48,240
insecure

2764
02:11:48,240 --> 02:11:51,000
unless you have the labor force with the
kids,

2765
02:11:51,260 --> 02:11:53,130
like not to say that we're gonna make 
the kids work,

2766
02:11:53,131 --> 02:11:56,640
but it's to be a learning experience and
people can take their turns.

2767
02:11:56,880 --> 02:12:01,050
Preparing family meals inside of the 
school system is a valuable tool

2768
02:12:01,060 --> 02:12:04,390
tool and if it was done and handled with
respect and appreciation,

2769
02:12:04,391 --> 02:12:08,320
if they have classes perhaps that showed
how important food is,

2770
02:12:08,530 --> 02:12:11,900
I mean maybe even show an episode of no 
reservations or you know,

2771
02:12:11,910 --> 02:12:12,743
or parts unknown and show how people can
appreciate food and what food really is 

2772
02:12:18,191 --> 02:12:19,960
and how great it would be.
I mean,

2773
02:12:20,020 --> 02:12:24,790
and also it would open their eyes to the
possibility of food as a career of,

2774
02:12:24,820 --> 02:12:25,653
you know,
of getting into the same position that 

2775
02:12:26,981 --> 02:12:28,990
you guys are in.
I mean,

2776
02:12:29,020 --> 02:12:30,520
this is something that's never 
discussed.

2777
02:12:30,530 --> 02:12:31,363
Mean.
When was the last time a kid was 

2778
02:12:32,021 --> 02:12:33,940
encouraged to become a chef.
You know,

2779
02:12:34,580 --> 02:12:36,520
is a standup comedian,
you know,

2780
02:12:36,521 --> 02:12:38,530
you never get encouraged to stand up 
comedian,

2781
02:12:38,680 --> 02:12:41,650
they just call you a fuck up and try to 
put you on drugs.

2782
02:12:41,820 --> 02:12:44,420
It never comes out when they do a survey
and you know,

2783
02:12:44,430 --> 02:12:45,263
90 percent of our labor force inside the
restaurants is you could anybody who 

2784
02:12:48,511 --> 02:12:49,344
cooks inside the restaurants is someone 
who didn't work inside the traditional 

2785
02:12:54,541 --> 02:12:55,740
school system.
You know,

2786
02:12:55,741 --> 02:12:58,230
we,
we employ a dropouts.

2787
02:12:58,400 --> 02:12:59,233
Yeah.
Yeah.

2788
02:12:59,250 --> 02:13:01,020
But brilliant.
You know,

2789
02:13:01,021 --> 02:13:03,150
we've,
there's brilliant people on the team.

2790
02:13:03,151 --> 02:13:06,360
They just,
the school system did not work for them.

2791
02:13:06,480 --> 02:13:09,210
Well that's the same thing with both of 
my jobs,

2792
02:13:09,211 --> 02:13:12,000
whether it's the UFC or whether it's 
standup comedy.

2793
02:13:12,330 --> 02:13:13,163
Everyone that I'm close with is a fuck 
up in the traditional sense like we 

2794
02:13:17,281 --> 02:13:18,640
didn't.
None of us fit in.

2795
02:13:18,641 --> 02:13:19,474
It's very few people that get into 
standup comedy that were thriving and 

2796
02:13:22,591 --> 02:13:23,424
some other career.
Most of us were extremely frustrated 

2797
02:13:26,251 --> 02:13:27,084
with traditional environments and most 
of us didn't do well in school because 

2798
02:13:30,541 --> 02:13:35,130
we felt and just couldn't wait to get 
nightmares about going back to school.

2799
02:13:35,160 --> 02:13:37,680
Do you have add as a child?
I'm sure I got it all,

2800
02:13:37,980 --> 02:13:38,813
whatever the fuck it is,
whatever it is that gives you energy 

2801
02:13:40,681 --> 02:13:43,110
that makes you better at stuff,
and I got that.

2802
02:13:44,050 --> 02:13:46,380
They'll call it a bad thing and say 
like,

2803
02:13:46,381 --> 02:13:48,630
you can't concentrate while I'm fucking 
bored.

2804
02:13:48,780 --> 02:13:49,613
Give them knocking,
treated me something that I can 

2805
02:13:51,841 --> 02:13:54,630
concentrate on,
give me something that I actually enjoy.

2806
02:13:54,780 --> 02:13:55,613
I got a lot of energy.
It's not that there's something wrong 

2807
02:13:57,961 --> 02:13:58,794
with me and said,
I have no interest and what they're 

2808
02:14:00,931 --> 02:14:01,764
selling and it's being sold by some 
underpaid under motivated person who 

2809
02:14:05,880 --> 02:14:06,713
really is just following some sort of a 
curriculum and they have to do that 

2810
02:14:08,761 --> 02:14:12,480
because they want to keep their job.
This is what kids are being subjected to

2811
02:14:12,481 --> 02:14:13,314
all across the world in the most fertile
time of their life in terms of their 

2812
02:14:17,851 --> 02:14:20,970
imagination,
their creativity and their free time.

2813
02:14:21,210 --> 02:14:22,043
Frontal cortex is a sponge.
They're ready to take everything and no 

2814
02:14:27,541 --> 02:14:28,374
one would ever say to some kid who's 
cracking jokes in class and running 

2815
02:14:32,611 --> 02:14:34,380
around being a fool.
No one would ever say,

2816
02:14:34,381 --> 02:14:36,870
hey,
you ever thought about being a comedian?

2817
02:14:37,080 --> 02:14:38,580
Like,
no one says that.

2818
02:14:38,780 --> 02:14:42,330
Just never comes up,
but meanwhile everybody loves comedians.

2819
02:14:42,570 --> 02:14:43,403
People love to go see comedy,
but nobody ever says to some fuck up 

2820
02:14:45,901 --> 02:14:47,190
kid,
hey man,

2821
02:14:47,400 --> 02:14:49,620
you might be a comic.
You know,

2822
02:14:49,621 --> 02:14:51,060
it just doesn't.
Doesn't come up.

2823
02:14:51,640 --> 02:14:52,473
They will do the test and like David was
supposed to be a travel agent was I was 

2824
02:14:57,240 --> 02:14:58,073
supposed to be a golf pro in Canada.
You're supposed to be a golf pro at a 

2825
02:15:02,111 --> 02:15:02,950
coffee.
No,

2826
02:15:03,180 --> 02:15:04,013
and then according to the questionnaire,
and one of my friend who flies planes 

2827
02:15:07,220 --> 02:15:08,053
was supposed think to be a folly.
Artists make sounds of horses with 

2828
02:15:10,701 --> 02:15:12,520
coconuts and movies like,
yeah,

2829
02:15:12,521 --> 02:15:13,290
yeah.
That's fine.

2830
02:15:13,290 --> 02:15:15,120
That's what they told them.
After the questionnaire,

2831
02:15:15,150 --> 02:15:17,910
what the fuck kind of questionnaire do 
you guys have in Canada?

2832
02:15:17,990 --> 02:15:21,110
The success of restaurant though you 
have to think though,

2833
02:15:21,320 --> 02:15:26,320
is due to a lot of very sad people that 
have gone through the academic process.

2834
02:15:27,080 --> 02:15:27,913
I have a disproportion amount of lawyers
and professionals and people who wear 

2835
02:15:34,191 --> 02:15:35,024
suits that love to come to the 
restaurant and drink wine and let the 

2836
02:15:39,351 --> 02:15:40,184
dog stopped barking inside their heads 
because they're really fucking 

2837
02:15:43,041 --> 02:15:44,310
miserable.
You know,

2838
02:15:44,311 --> 02:15:45,144
when you spent your whole day in the 
72nd floor of the IBM tower downtown in 

2839
02:15:51,171 --> 02:15:52,004
your cubicle,
punching data into graphs and taking a 

2840
02:15:55,701 --> 02:15:58,460
licking from your boss,
who's also a suit,

2841
02:15:59,570 --> 02:16:02,600
just a constant.
You can't wait to get to Joe beef and,

2842
02:16:02,601 --> 02:16:03,434
you know,
relax or like the Michael Douglas movie 

2843
02:16:06,051 --> 02:16:07,160
there.
Enough.

2844
02:16:07,560 --> 02:16:08,870
Oh,
what was that called?

2845
02:16:09,110 --> 02:16:10,550
Falling down.
Falling down.

2846
02:16:10,610 --> 02:16:11,443
Yeah.
Yeah.

2847
02:16:11,900 --> 02:16:13,250
Enough with his,
with Jello.

2848
02:16:15,830 --> 02:16:17,750
What is enough?
What does she do?

2849
02:16:17,980 --> 02:16:18,870
Gigli me.
No,

2850
02:16:18,980 --> 02:16:19,491
no,
no,

2851
02:16:19,491 --> 02:16:19,851
no,
no,

2852
02:16:19,851 --> 02:16:20,681
no,
no enough.

2853
02:16:20,681 --> 02:16:22,330
Is the movie with Delaware where she,
uh,

2854
02:16:22,480 --> 02:16:23,313
she avengers,
some ex boyfriend that traumatizes her 

2855
02:16:27,210 --> 02:16:28,330
intubated is.
It's great.

2856
02:16:28,390 --> 02:16:31,390
I love movies.
Okay.

2857
02:16:31,391 --> 02:16:33,700
There's something about airplanes.
I don't know if the,

2858
02:16:33,790 --> 02:16:34,623
the added the altitude and the that like
stupid movies are great and you're in 

2859
02:16:37,991 --> 02:16:41,500
the sky and nothing covered.
He's quite the movie buff.

2860
02:16:42,220 --> 02:16:43,960
He loves Notting Hill.
He was like,

2861
02:16:43,961 --> 02:16:45,310
that's a beautiful movie.
I was like,

2862
02:16:45,820 --> 02:16:48,220
I don't even know what that's about.
What's not in Hilbert?

2863
02:16:48,410 --> 02:16:50,620
That's the movie with Hugh Grant.
Oh,

2864
02:16:50,621 --> 02:16:53,150
Christ.
I can't remember what it's about.

2865
02:16:53,200 --> 02:16:54,033
You know what I loved?
I loved the night that the rocksbury 

2866
02:16:56,110 --> 02:16:57,160
started drinking again,
man.

2867
02:16:59,420 --> 02:17:01,030
Julian Robertson,
Hugh Grant.

2868
02:17:01,520 --> 02:17:03,010
We were just,
you know,

2869
02:17:03,011 --> 02:17:06,370
the shadow is right by the Roxbury.
It was.

2870
02:17:06,750 --> 02:17:09,250
I couldn't wait to just get out of the 
car,

2871
02:17:09,251 --> 02:17:11,020
go walk there,
take a picture of it,

2872
02:17:11,021 --> 02:17:14,950
and just like try to show like I sent 
the picture to everyone.

2873
02:17:15,010 --> 02:17:16,450
Nobody reacted,
dude.

2874
02:17:16,451 --> 02:17:21,451
It's the Rocksbury you see you saw that 
movie night at the Roxbury?

2875
02:17:22,510 --> 02:17:23,450
Yeah.
Yeah.

2876
02:17:23,610 --> 02:17:26,000
I saw the movie and for me to travel 
there is like,

2877
02:17:26,360 --> 02:17:28,060
you liked that?
You like that movie?

2878
02:17:28,380 --> 02:17:29,410
I loved it.
Really?

2879
02:17:29,470 --> 02:17:30,480
Yeah.
Hm.

2880
02:17:31,570 --> 02:17:32,403
Yeah.
Hmm.

2881
02:17:32,710 --> 02:17:34,030
Interesting.
Same reaction.

2882
02:17:34,930 --> 02:17:39,490
What else is your favorite movie alone 
in the Wilderness?

2883
02:17:39,520 --> 02:17:40,900
Dick Panicky lives.
Great.

2884
02:17:40,930 --> 02:17:41,763
You saw that movie,
the guy that whittles a hinges for his 

2885
02:17:44,261 --> 02:17:46,420
house in Alaska show.
That's a must view.

2886
02:17:46,450 --> 02:17:47,283
Oh,
is it really just like once a year you 

2887
02:17:48,491 --> 02:17:51,930
watch really alone in the wilderness.
Dick Prentky.

2888
02:17:51,940 --> 02:17:53,920
Can you bring that up on the thing?
What is that?

2889
02:17:54,900 --> 02:17:57,230
The guy runs away like,
no,

2890
02:17:57,260 --> 02:17:57,561
no,
no,

2891
02:17:57,561 --> 02:17:58,080
no,
no.

2892
02:17:58,080 --> 02:17:58,913
I'll ask you a guy who just moves and 
lives in the woods for the rest of his 

2893
02:18:01,030 --> 02:18:03,200
life.
The French love Jerry Lewis.

2894
02:18:03,220 --> 02:18:06,070
Now they plan on their mock pbs as a 
fundraiser every year.

2895
02:18:06,490 --> 02:18:07,323
Wow.
Why is this guy put his ipod and films 

2896
02:18:10,241 --> 02:18:11,074
himself and he.
He carves everything you need hunts 

2897
02:18:14,571 --> 02:18:15,130
every year.

2898
02:18:15,130 --> 02:18:16,060
Oh,
okay.

2899
02:18:16,061 --> 02:18:16,894
Okay.
Okay.

2900
02:18:16,970 --> 02:18:18,880
I have,
I did not know this guy's name,

2901
02:18:19,030 --> 02:18:20,560
so I thought you were talking about a 
move.

2902
02:18:20,561 --> 02:18:21,760
This is like a documentary

2903
02:18:22,200 --> 02:18:23,033
self made,
so he literally gets dropped off there 

2904
02:18:24,441 --> 02:18:27,740
with an ax and then he builds a house 
and then he kills a goat and then,

2905
02:18:27,800 --> 02:18:28,500
you know.

2906
02:18:28,500 --> 02:18:29,333
Yeah,
I do remember this guy in interviews 

2907
02:18:31,680 --> 02:18:33,990
that I,
I think I probably saw on youtube,

2908
02:18:33,991 --> 02:18:34,824
but yeah,
he builds his own house and log cabins 

2909
02:18:37,651 --> 02:18:38,460
and shit.
Yeah.

2910
02:18:38,460 --> 02:18:39,270
Yeah.
This guy.

2911
02:18:39,270 --> 02:18:39,931
Yeah.
Oh,

2912
02:18:39,931 --> 02:18:40,764
that's such a beautiful.
Did you guys ever see that vice piece 

2913
02:18:43,860 --> 02:18:48,360
about the guy who lives in the Arctic 
Hind Mo Heimos Arctic adventure?

2914
02:18:48,740 --> 02:18:50,280
No,
fucking amazing man.

2915
02:18:50,490 --> 02:18:51,323
It's a vice guide to travel piece where 
this guy got a very small cabin in the 

2916
02:18:58,381 --> 02:18:59,214
Arctic in the 19 seventies and he's been
there since the only thing he's ever 

2917
02:19:03,391 --> 02:19:05,550
seen from nine slash 11 and some 
photographs.

2918
02:19:05,790 --> 02:19:08,160
He had no idea what's happening when it 
happened.

2919
02:19:08,430 --> 02:19:09,470
Um,
he is,

2920
02:19:09,471 --> 02:19:11,760
he still loved Michael Jackson,
I don't know,

2921
02:19:11,970 --> 02:19:13,290
but this is it.
This,

2922
02:19:13,360 --> 02:19:14,193
this guy lives alone in Alaska with his 
wife in the Arctic national refuge and 

2923
02:19:20,631 --> 02:19:21,464
uh,
you have to get in with a float plane 

2924
02:19:22,830 --> 02:19:27,090
and he just hunted Caribou and he lives 
with his family.

2925
02:19:27,620 --> 02:19:28,453
Wife is into it and they have children 
together and children leave and 

2926
02:19:33,320 --> 02:19:35,030
eventually went on to college.
I mean,

2927
02:19:35,031 --> 02:19:38,320
it's fucking crazy.
One of their kids was two years old,

2928
02:19:38,360 --> 02:19:39,193
died in a canoe accident.
The canoe fell over and the kid fell 

2929
02:19:42,351 --> 02:19:47,120
into the river and they revisit the spot
at the time of her birthday.

2930
02:19:47,420 --> 02:19:51,920
And it's really intense.
But this guy really believes that people

2931
02:19:51,921 --> 02:19:52,754
are there.
They're happier and healthier when they 

2932
02:19:56,271 --> 02:20:01,271
live a hunter gatherer lifestyle and 
choleric restriction.

2933
02:20:02,540 --> 02:20:04,340
All he does is eat Caribou.
I mean,

2934
02:20:04,341 --> 02:20:05,610
the guy is out there,
uh,

2935
02:20:05,640 --> 02:20:08,690
eating Caribou and during the time where
they're filming this,

2936
02:20:08,990 --> 02:20:09,823
his cabin and is caribou stash,
gets attacked by a grizzly bear and he 

2937
02:20:13,011 --> 02:20:13,844
shoots the grizzly bear on film.
He chases it down to the night and 

2938
02:20:17,780 --> 02:20:18,613
blasts it.
One of the grizzly bears and eaten one 

2939
02:20:20,931 --> 02:20:21,920
of his dogs.
I mean,

2940
02:20:22,300 --> 02:20:25,600
this is motherfuckers out there living,
but he was like,

2941
02:20:25,700 --> 02:20:27,140
he's a very smart guy.

2942
02:20:27,140 --> 02:20:30,230
He's not what you would think when you 
think of someone like this,

2943
02:20:30,231 --> 02:20:31,064
you think of someone who has some weird 
kind of inbred halfwit who's living up 

2944
02:20:35,601 --> 02:20:37,160
there.
I know he's very intelligent,

2945
02:20:37,161 --> 02:20:39,880
very introvert.
Maybe,

2946
02:20:40,130 --> 02:20:40,963
maybe introverted for sure,
but it doesn't seem to have a hard time 

2947
02:20:43,011 --> 02:20:45,020
talking to people.
So I don't know if he's introverted,

2948
02:20:45,350 --> 02:20:47,480
but I mean he,
he's definitely restricted his,

2949
02:20:48,010 --> 02:20:50,540
his access to dialogue.
I mean,

2950
02:20:50,541 --> 02:20:52,400
he's out there alone in the forest by 
himself,

2951
02:20:52,401 --> 02:20:53,234
but he makes a very compelling point 
that there's a natural feeling that he 

2952
02:20:57,171 --> 02:21:00,150
gets from doing this where everything 
falls into place.

2953
02:21:00,151 --> 02:21:00,984
He's constantly getting exercise because
he's hiking and chasing after these 

2954
02:21:03,801 --> 02:21:04,634
Caribou,
but that there's natural human reward 

2955
02:21:06,651 --> 02:21:07,484
systems that are in place in his DNA for
hunting and gathering and cooking this 

2956
02:21:10,611 --> 02:21:13,100
food over an open fire and the way he 
lives.

2957
02:21:13,101 --> 02:21:13,934
He just,
he just thinks it's the way people 

2958
02:21:15,560 --> 02:21:17,180
really are designed to live.

2959
02:21:17,210 --> 02:21:22,210
We're absolutely not meant to live,
piled on top of each other within,

2960
02:21:22,460 --> 02:21:23,293
you know,
10 million of us in a square mile and 

2961
02:21:26,151 --> 02:21:27,470
the island of Manhattan,
you know?

2962
02:21:28,640 --> 02:21:29,473
Absolutely.
Do you remember when there was the 

2963
02:21:31,821 --> 02:21:33,350
floods in Manhattan?
Yes.

2964
02:21:34,070 --> 02:21:36,740
All the money in the world couldn't get 
you out.

2965
02:21:37,160 --> 02:21:37,993
Right?
You have to walk across the Brooklyn 

2966
02:21:40,310 --> 02:21:42,710
Bridge to leave Manhattan with everybody
else.

2967
02:21:42,770 --> 02:21:43,910
Yeah.
You know?

2968
02:21:45,110 --> 02:21:45,943
Yeah.
And there was a real worry because of 

2969
02:21:46,851 --> 02:21:48,650
climate change that was going to be 
happening every year.

2970
02:21:48,651 --> 02:21:49,640
Now.
People were like,

2971
02:21:49,641 --> 02:21:50,474
is this the new normal?
I remember Shane Smith at some piece of 

2972
02:21:52,960 --> 02:21:54,710
the walkout.
Yeah.

2973
02:21:54,740 --> 02:21:55,820
Yeah.
Shane had to walk out and.

2974
02:21:55,821 --> 02:21:59,720
But he had some piece on vice where they
were detailing the inside of his,

2975
02:21:59,721 --> 02:22:01,160
uh,
apartment building.

2976
02:22:01,161 --> 02:22:04,520
Like the fucking thing was completely 
flooded like six feet high and water,

2977
02:22:04,990 --> 02:22:06,270
you know,
and people were worried,

2978
02:22:06,410 --> 02:22:09,440
worried like this is going to be what's 
happening on a regular basis.

2979
02:22:09,441 --> 02:22:12,350
Now this climate change thing has 
changed.

2980
02:22:12,830 --> 02:22:13,870
I have a heightened sense of,
uh,

2981
02:22:13,990 --> 02:22:15,350
you know,
since I have three kids,

2982
02:22:15,351 --> 02:22:17,150
I,
it's something that I think about.

2983
02:22:17,151 --> 02:22:19,010
It's something that I have ready.
You know,

2984
02:22:19,011 --> 02:22:21,140
I bought a generator.
I have,

2985
02:22:22,400 --> 02:22:25,890
I checked the batteries are rechargeable
batteries for all of the that I have.

2986
02:22:25,891 --> 02:22:26,070
I

2987
02:22:26,070 --> 02:22:26,903
own solar panels,
I own the Duffel bag full of everything 

2988
02:22:30,541 --> 02:22:32,730
that I need to throw in the back of my 
pickup truck,

2989
02:22:32,731 --> 02:22:33,564
grabbed my kids and I know which way to 
drive away from the city to go to the 

2990
02:22:36,721 --> 02:22:40,380
cabin.
It's something I've planned just because

2991
02:22:40,950 --> 02:22:44,340
I'm the ward of these small humans whom 
I love.

2992
02:22:44,480 --> 02:22:45,650
Yeah.
You know,

2993
02:22:45,920 --> 02:22:50,920
it's funny you talked about like 
restriction again and the thing just I'm

2994
02:22:51,951 --> 02:22:53,800
thinking of preparing,
you know,

2995
02:22:53,801 --> 02:22:54,634
and the most common thing that people 
prepare his food and prepare cans and 

2996
02:22:58,671 --> 02:22:59,504
cans and cans of food,
but still they eat so much of that food 

2997
02:23:02,900 --> 02:23:03,733
that the best way to prepare,
the best way to prepare would be to 

2998
02:23:07,761 --> 02:23:12,761
start to eat less and learn how to live 
at 1700 calories,

2999
02:23:13,340 --> 02:23:14,173
you know,
and learn how to live with the people 

3000
02:23:16,281 --> 02:23:17,114
around you because if you're going to 
spend like two months in the bunker or 

3001
02:23:20,210 --> 02:23:25,210
in a bug out location or whatever,
you're not some asshole to your kids and

3002
02:23:26,151 --> 02:23:28,400
your friends and family and people with 
you.

3003
02:23:28,500 --> 02:23:29,910
One of the things that happens to 
people,

3004
02:23:29,911 --> 02:23:33,060
this is really fascinating when,
when disasters do strike,

3005
02:23:33,061 --> 02:23:35,460
because everyone gets a lot friendlier.
You know,

3006
02:23:35,461 --> 02:23:39,430
and this is one thing that I've 
experienced myself this week because uh,

3007
02:23:39,570 --> 02:23:41,670
when we got evacuated,
it was 2:30

3008
02:23:41,671 --> 02:23:46,440
in the morning on Thursday and there was
fire a rock's throw from my house.

3009
02:23:46,740 --> 02:23:48,360
And I'm not talking a little bit of 
fire.

3010
02:23:48,361 --> 02:23:50,730
I'm talking to hundreds of acres of 
fire.

3011
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:51,833
I mean it was just roaring over.
We started to see houses started seeing 

3012
02:23:54,461 --> 02:23:55,294
the gas lines explode.
Houses burst into flames and it was 

3013
02:23:58,621 --> 02:24:02,130
right down the street.
So we're seeing this and you know,

3014
02:24:02,131 --> 02:24:02,851
we're,
we're,

3015
02:24:02,851 --> 02:24:04,110
we're,
we got outside,

3016
02:24:04,111 --> 02:24:05,640
we're in the driveway.
The neighbors come over,

3017
02:24:05,641 --> 02:24:06,800
everyone's talking,
what are you going to do?

3018
02:24:06,810 --> 02:24:08,850
I go,
we're getting the fuck out of here.

3019
02:24:09,060 --> 02:24:11,220
And he's like,
have they given the evacuation orders?

3020
02:24:11,220 --> 02:24:11,880
I said,
no,

3021
02:24:11,880 --> 02:24:12,990
we haven't,
but I go,

3022
02:24:12,991 --> 02:24:14,010
it's right there,
man.

3023
02:24:14,220 --> 02:24:15,210
I go,
we gotta go.

3024
02:24:15,390 --> 02:24:16,223
I go,
if it,

3025
02:24:16,230 --> 02:24:18,810
if we're wrong and we come back in,
the house is still here.

3026
02:24:18,840 --> 02:24:19,673
That's okay,
but you want to get out of these things 

3027
02:24:21,991 --> 02:24:24,030
quickly because they can turn south 
quickly.

3028
02:24:24,031 --> 02:24:28,500
But there was this sense of comradery 
and community that that happens and then

3029
02:24:28,800 --> 02:24:30,900
quite a few of us all went to the same 
hotel,

3030
02:24:30,901 --> 02:24:31,734
including my friend Tom Segura and his 
wife and his family went to this hotel 

3031
02:24:34,381 --> 02:24:35,214
too with some of my friends from this 
neighborhood who were all there huddled 

3032
02:24:37,891 --> 02:24:39,000
in together and.
But there was,

3033
02:24:39,390 --> 02:24:42,270
there wasn't.
People were a little extra friendly.

3034
02:24:42,480 --> 02:24:43,730
There was a.
This is like a.

3035
02:24:43,830 --> 02:24:44,663
There was the same kind of feeling after
nine slash 11 when I was in New York 

3036
02:24:47,970 --> 02:24:48,803
City.
There was people are little bit more 

3037
02:24:50,041 --> 02:24:50,620
friendly.

3038
02:24:50,620 --> 02:24:52,690
We felt that during the ice storm back 
in the day,

3039
02:24:52,691 --> 02:24:57,220
people were like I saying the street 
that we live on,

3040
02:24:57,400 --> 02:24:58,420
and then they go,
well,

3041
02:24:58,450 --> 02:25:00,490
who's got a wood burning stove?
And they go,

3042
02:25:00,491 --> 02:25:01,324
oh,
Roger does come over and then people 

3043
02:25:02,831 --> 02:25:03,664
would go to Roger's house and all of a 
sudden all these neighbors that just 

3044
02:25:05,711 --> 02:25:06,544
wave at each other,
we're all at Roger's house by the wood 

3045
02:25:09,311 --> 02:25:10,144
burning stove,
going back to the houses to get 

3046
02:25:12,941 --> 02:25:14,440
blankets,
planning,

3047
02:25:14,441 --> 02:25:18,100
sleeping arrangements,
planning food arrangements,

3048
02:25:18,430 --> 02:25:19,263
and assessing each other,
giving each other their personal space 

3049
02:25:22,270 --> 02:25:23,103
and learning how to speak to each other 
and a respect of mattered that we might 

3050
02:25:25,961 --> 02:25:30,961
have to do this for several days and 
through the through tragedy,

3051
02:25:33,260 --> 02:25:38,260
a sense of community was built somewhat 
or reinforced for a brief moment in time

3052
02:25:38,980 --> 02:25:43,030
which made going back to our regular 
lives on that street better.

3053
02:25:43,540 --> 02:25:44,530
Yeah.
You know?

3054
02:25:44,830 --> 02:25:45,910
Yeah.
Yeah.

3055
02:25:46,010 --> 02:25:46,821
If you ever read,
uh,

3056
02:25:46,821 --> 02:25:49,590
Sebastian younger's tribe,
no,

3057
02:25:49,910 --> 02:25:52,220
it's a great book,
and he kind of talks about that,

3058
02:25:52,221 --> 02:25:53,054
about how in part situations of extreme 
stress and when people are really 

3059
02:25:58,131 --> 02:26:01,850
pushed,
those people bond together and they find

3060
02:26:01,851 --> 02:26:04,160
that these are the happiest times of 
their life.

3061
02:26:04,430 --> 02:26:08,390
People that even go to war,
they find that they missed the comradery

3062
02:26:08,420 --> 02:26:10,280
of the bunker.
They admit the miss,

3063
02:26:10,281 --> 02:26:12,050
the camaraderie of being in the 
trenches.

3064
02:26:12,230 --> 02:26:14,420
They missed the camaraderie of being 
together,

3065
02:26:14,421 --> 02:26:15,254
huddled up,
not knowing what's going to happen in 

3066
02:26:17,271 --> 02:26:18,104
the future,
but counting and dependent upon each 

3067
02:26:19,641 --> 02:26:20,930
other for their very live.

3068
02:26:20,950 --> 02:26:22,870
So that's a thing that happens in very,
very,

3069
02:26:22,871 --> 02:26:24,350
very busy kitchens.
Yeah.

3070
02:26:24,480 --> 02:26:25,480
Uh,
you know,

3071
02:26:25,481 --> 02:26:28,780
a bunch of no education guys out of 
cooking school,

3072
02:26:28,781 --> 02:26:33,781
working a,
a difficult restaurant line,

3073
02:26:34,570 --> 02:26:36,280
you know,
we're working six guys,

3074
02:26:36,520 --> 02:26:39,370
six,
four burner stove every night.

3075
02:26:40,030 --> 02:26:45,030
A difficult menu with a difficult chef 
and a very busy restaurant.

3076
02:26:46,950 --> 02:26:47,761
Those,
those,

3077
02:26:47,761 --> 02:26:49,690
those hours,
you know,

3078
02:26:49,691 --> 02:26:52,300
from 6:00
PM till 10:00

3079
02:26:52,300 --> 02:26:54,550
PM at night,
like it's intimate.

3080
02:26:54,700 --> 02:26:56,020
It's intimate.
Like,

3081
02:26:56,021 --> 02:26:58,990
you know,
like you're bending over to get into the

3082
02:26:58,991 --> 02:26:59,824
stove to get a chicken out.
I'm grabbing something out of the 

3083
02:27:01,721 --> 02:27:02,890
fridge.
My nose is in your,

3084
02:27:02,891 --> 02:27:04,690
but your nose is in my,
but uh,

3085
02:27:04,691 --> 02:27:05,360
you know,
uh,

3086
02:27:05,360 --> 02:27:06,310
I,
I need your knife.

3087
02:27:06,311 --> 02:27:07,870
You need my knife.
Uh,

3088
02:27:08,770 --> 02:27:10,090
it's very,
very,

3089
02:27:10,091 --> 02:27:10,924
very close.
Quarter is often like some of my 

3090
02:27:12,371 --> 02:27:15,430
strongest relationships.
Some of his strongest relationships are,

3091
02:27:15,431 --> 02:27:16,264
you know,
the bond that I built with guys that 

3092
02:27:17,921 --> 02:27:18,754
I've cooked on lines,
whether in Europe or here are 

3093
02:27:22,001 --> 02:27:23,320
unbreakable.
You know,

3094
02:27:23,321 --> 02:27:26,050
these guys got your back.
Tony talked a lot about that,

3095
02:27:26,051 --> 02:27:26,600
you know?

3096
02:27:26,600 --> 02:27:27,433
Yeah.
I think people are better off when 

3097
02:27:28,971 --> 02:27:30,770
they're struggling.
I really do.

3098
02:27:30,890 --> 02:27:32,560
I mean,
I think they're better off when they're,

3099
02:27:32,561 --> 02:27:33,394
they're,
they're,

3100
02:27:33,710 --> 02:27:34,543
you know,
when life creates challenges and 

3101
02:27:38,110 --> 02:27:38,943
there's,
there's things to overcome and there's 

3102
02:27:41,001 --> 02:27:45,650
difficulties to get through and there's 
real pressure involved in these.

3103
02:27:45,651 --> 02:27:47,570
And there's physical activity involved 
in these pressure.

3104
02:27:48,070 --> 02:27:52,520
Something growing on the Galley,
the century and in the cat of nine tails

3105
02:27:52,521 --> 02:27:52,990
looming over.

3106
02:27:52,990 --> 02:27:53,823
Were you,
well all the years you guys had been in 

3107
02:27:55,531 --> 02:27:57,270
business,
now what,

3108
02:27:57,330 --> 02:27:59,850
what do you look forward to now?
Like what,

3109
02:27:59,851 --> 02:28:00,684
what keeps you going?
Now you have this established 

3110
02:28:02,071 --> 02:28:04,260
restaurant,
this amazing menu,

3111
02:28:04,261 --> 02:28:05,094
and you know,
you have fans of your restaurant like 

3112
02:28:06,751 --> 02:28:07,920
myself.
What,

3113
02:28:07,930 --> 02:28:08,820
what keeps you going?

3114
02:28:08,940 --> 02:28:11,340
Tiny restaurant where David and I cook,
you know,

3115
02:28:11,610 --> 02:28:12,443
like,
uh,

3116
02:28:12,450 --> 02:28:14,010
you saw the movie,
the French connection?

3117
02:28:14,130 --> 02:28:16,500
Yes.
You see when Lachman's on the other side

3118
02:28:16,501 --> 02:28:18,510
of the road,
it's like freezing in New York.

3119
02:28:18,511 --> 02:28:21,060
He's in the Deli with a piece of pizza 
and a shitty coffee.

3120
02:28:21,530 --> 02:28:22,363
His little leather shoes on the icy 
pavement and then the French gangsters 

3121
02:28:25,401 --> 02:28:29,930
or in the Bistro in the eating like 
snails and eclairs and like all the food

3122
02:28:29,931 --> 02:28:32,600
that comes into the little crock pots on
the cart at the table.

3123
02:28:33,470 --> 02:28:34,303
If we could open a place like that for 
like 16 customers that we have the key 

3124
02:28:37,581 --> 02:28:42,050
only we decide to open whenever we want 
and we don't lose money.

3125
02:28:42,200 --> 02:28:43,940
That's all I,
I like.

3126
02:28:44,330 --> 02:28:45,163
I want to build with Fred,
a tiny little French restaurant that we 

3127
02:28:50,210 --> 02:28:54,450
do what we want.
16 seats an art project or I can take it

3128
02:28:54,460 --> 02:28:55,293
four or eight or close it or just a toy 
to just practice this skill that we've 

3129
02:29:02,031 --> 02:29:04,790
learned all of these years to do this 
very,

3130
02:29:04,791 --> 02:29:09,110
very weird old for gotten food that's 
not cool,

3131
02:29:10,550 --> 02:29:12,020
but that I adore.

3132
02:29:12,110 --> 02:29:13,400
You know what,
what are you like?

3133
02:29:13,580 --> 02:29:16,940
What is in the back of your head that 
you don't bring to Joe Beef?

3134
02:29:17,540 --> 02:29:18,760
Oh,
you know,

3135
02:29:19,260 --> 02:29:22,340
one that everybody would know.
But to do a proper lamb.

3136
02:29:22,341 --> 02:29:26,790
Wellington served for two people and a 
little trolley distill,

3137
02:29:26,840 --> 02:29:27,673
bring out the 12 cheeses on the little 
trolley to have a trolley just of dst 

3138
02:29:34,040 --> 02:29:34,873
crave to do crepes.
Tableside to do a duck lumbago to with 

3139
02:29:38,751 --> 02:29:40,840
orange sauce.
Tableside for two.

3140
02:29:40,890 --> 02:29:41,723
You so it Tony.
We went to the [inaudible] place in 

3141
02:29:43,731 --> 02:29:44,564
Quebec City and the first show in the 
first parts unknown and it was 

3142
02:29:47,961 --> 02:29:51,270
wonderful,
like little land goose flung Baden.

3143
02:29:51,300 --> 02:29:52,133
Like there were skills like we want to 
be able to like just this morning we'll 

3144
02:29:56,001 --> 02:29:58,400
do Tartara and will be mixed table side 
and that's it.

3145
02:29:58,401 --> 02:30:02,780
Or Dover souls are really practice 
hospitality at the level that it used to

3146
02:30:02,781 --> 02:30:07,520
be back in the day to bring out the very
old porcelain,

3147
02:30:08,030 --> 02:30:10,880
very beautiful silver,
not ostentatious way,

3148
02:30:10,881 --> 02:30:13,940
just almost in like a kitschy roadmap at
a kitschy,

3149
02:30:14,450 --> 02:30:17,180
romantic,
kind of nostalgic,

3150
02:30:17,270 --> 02:30:18,560
nostalgic sense.

3151
02:30:18,590 --> 02:30:19,460
What,
you know,

3152
02:30:19,461 --> 02:30:23,390
to build a restaurant from the twenties,
you know,

3153
02:30:23,870 --> 02:30:28,610
do that food.
Hadn't written menu flowers on it,

3154
02:30:28,611 --> 02:30:29,444
you know,
like,

3155
02:30:31,070 --> 02:30:31,903
yeah,
the appreciation that you guys have for 

3156
02:30:33,231 --> 02:30:35,450
it is very contagious.
It really is.

3157
02:30:35,900 --> 02:30:37,190
Dining is great.
Like,

3158
02:30:37,191 --> 02:30:38,870
you know,
candle it dining,

3159
02:30:38,930 --> 02:30:41,130
you know,
it's odd,

3160
02:30:41,530 --> 02:30:43,670
you know,
heavy velvet woodwork,

3161
02:30:43,760 --> 02:30:45,560
silver trays,
copper,

3162
02:30:46,630 --> 02:30:47,463
uh,
just having way ask who's the other big 

3163
02:30:51,201 --> 02:30:54,320
guy with a orson welles ever see those 
morrison?

3164
02:30:54,321 --> 02:30:55,850
Well,
interviews at the hotel,

3165
02:30:55,851 --> 02:30:59,060
Pierre in Paris.
Those are just brilliant.

3166
02:30:59,061 --> 02:31:03,410
Like you want to just eat yourself to 
death at hotel Pierre and how,

3167
02:31:03,540 --> 02:31:04,390
what he did.
Yeah,

3168
02:31:04,430 --> 02:31:05,263
exactly.
It's the only way we could build a time 

3169
02:31:07,011 --> 02:31:08,030
travel machine.
Right?

3170
02:31:08,510 --> 02:31:13,250
Like you read about it.
It's fun when you go to museum,

3171
02:31:13,251 --> 02:31:16,670
when they see you,
you see like silverware for sunken ship.

3172
02:31:16,700 --> 02:31:17,511
Yeah.
That's nice.

3173
02:31:17,511 --> 02:31:21,960
But we'll never traveled back in time,
nor do I want to get polio,

3174
02:31:22,020 --> 02:31:23,460
you know,
there's great,

3175
02:31:23,520 --> 02:31:25,470
great benefits to living now.

3176
02:31:25,470 --> 02:31:27,190
And then now in here,
you know,

3177
02:31:27,540 --> 02:31:29,250
the art of it.
Yeah.

3178
02:31:29,300 --> 02:31:31,020
And,
and the beauty of it,

3179
02:31:31,460 --> 02:31:33,720
it's like we've grown up watching like 
this old house,

3180
02:31:33,721 --> 02:31:35,520
Victory Gardens,
all those shows on pbs.

3181
02:31:35,730 --> 02:31:40,080
We're huge fans.
And the beauty of this is we can build a

3182
02:31:40,081 --> 02:31:41,580
restaurant like that,
but our hands.

3183
02:31:41,940 --> 02:31:45,120
So we,
it's just a matter of is it this year?

3184
02:31:45,121 --> 02:31:46,850
Is it next year?
You know what,

3185
02:31:46,990 --> 02:31:48,900
we were doing it now,
by the way.

3186
02:31:49,150 --> 02:31:50,070
Yeah.
Are you?

3187
02:31:50,190 --> 02:31:50,791
Yeah,
we bought it.

3188
02:31:50,791 --> 02:31:53,400
I bought a farm and he's going to read.
I bought a farm I bought,

3189
02:31:53,480 --> 02:31:58,230
but Fred a farm for me is what the gag 
is.

3190
02:31:59,180 --> 02:32:00,390
Where are you guys?
Gonna do it.

3191
02:32:00,570 --> 02:32:01,403
I think down in St Dharma that I bought 
a little farm right on the Vermont 

3192
02:32:04,021 --> 02:32:04,854
border,
but there's a summer kitchen part as 

3193
02:32:06,630 --> 02:32:07,463
beautiful a brick,
a wood burning oven situation and a big 

3194
02:32:16,620 --> 02:32:17,640
window.

3195
02:32:17,640 --> 02:32:20,610
Uh,
an old factory rod iron window.

3196
02:32:20,611 --> 02:32:21,444
Or the room is just begging to have like
three tables of four or three tables of 

3197
02:32:26,641 --> 02:32:29,460
four and a little stove and the zinc 
bar.

3198
02:32:30,210 --> 02:32:32,250
And uh,
I don't know.

3199
02:32:32,251 --> 02:32:33,084
He's been cracking out.
He's talking about going down there in 

3200
02:32:34,471 --> 02:32:35,304
January and starting to build it.
This is the polar opposite of the theme 

3201
02:32:38,821 --> 02:32:40,980
restaurant in Vegas.
T gif.

3202
02:32:41,290 --> 02:32:43,140
Not just that,
but like the,

3203
02:32:43,141 --> 02:32:47,220
the celebrity chef as you're going down 
the escalator at the airport,

3204
02:32:47,221 --> 02:32:50,070
there's a giant billboard of this 
latest.

3205
02:32:50,250 --> 02:32:52,890
Did you ever hear this story about the 
Fertitta brothers would know.

3206
02:32:53,010 --> 02:32:55,230
So they,
they called Fred one day and they said,

3207
02:32:55,350 --> 02:32:57,240
we're coming to Montreal.
Uh,

3208
02:32:57,300 --> 02:33:00,260
we'd love to meet you guys ever like,
yeah,

3209
02:33:00,261 --> 02:33:01,980
okay.
I'm really what's going on.

3210
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:03,810
You know,
we're not open for this.

3211
02:33:04,360 --> 02:33:06,300
Last year,
last year after they sold,

3212
02:33:06,330 --> 02:33:07,620
I think they bought the poems.

3213
02:33:07,650 --> 02:33:10,440
They have cash the whole.
And they're great guys.

3214
02:33:10,650 --> 02:33:12,230
I love those guys.
It's fast.

3215
02:33:12,330 --> 02:33:13,380
Okay,
wonderful.

3216
02:33:13,390 --> 02:33:14,223
You get ahold of you.
So they got to fly into privately to 

3217
02:33:16,281 --> 02:33:17,210
the,
to the airport.

3218
02:33:17,230 --> 02:33:18,063
Montreal.
Three escalades roll into Joe beef at 

3219
02:33:19,981 --> 02:33:22,560
noon on a Tuesday.
Uh,

3220
02:33:22,680 --> 02:33:25,980
all the boys get out a plus help and you
know,

3221
02:33:26,010 --> 02:33:28,780
the crew over that surrounds them since.
Yeah,

3222
02:33:28,800 --> 02:33:31,680
we make a table of 10.
We all sit down.

3223
02:33:31,710 --> 02:33:32,543
Lorenzo starts off first,
I'd like to let you guys know that Joe 

3224
02:33:35,101 --> 02:33:38,460
beef is my favorite restaurant and I'm 
like,

3225
02:33:38,490 --> 02:33:41,850
what,
you know this dump your Lorenzo Fertitta

3226
02:33:42,630 --> 02:33:47,630
all over the world live in Las Vegas.
Everything is at your Beck and call like

3227
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:49,830
you live in the,
you know,

3228
02:33:51,120 --> 02:33:52,770
so that was flattering,
you know,

3229
02:33:52,771 --> 02:33:54,570
and we prepared a little dinner for 
them,

3230
02:33:54,571 --> 02:33:59,430
a little lunch and do we talk.
Then they pitched us to take over one of

3231
02:33:59,431 --> 02:34:00,264
the rooms and the palms upstairs and uh,
of course I always flattering we had a 

3232
02:34:05,161 --> 02:34:05,994
wonderful meeting but we knew right away
as we were having the meeting and that 

3233
02:34:08,371 --> 02:34:10,490
was not for us and it was never going to
happen.

3234
02:34:10,500 --> 02:34:11,333
We have young children and we're in a 
bad place to at the time was tough in 

3235
02:34:16,411 --> 02:34:17,610
our life,
you know,

3236
02:34:17,710 --> 02:34:18,070
still

3237
02:34:18,070 --> 02:34:19,670
drinking.
Still not.

3238
02:34:20,370 --> 02:34:21,250
Yeah,
it was pretty dark,

3239
02:34:21,251 --> 02:34:25,570
but it was nice and flattering and I 
think fred moved them onto mark Vacherie

3240
02:34:25,571 --> 02:34:29,920
who eventually did the project from 
Philadelphia and in retrospect,

3241
02:34:29,940 --> 02:34:33,220
uh,
yeah,

3242
02:34:33,221 --> 02:34:34,960
I was nice flattering,
but we wouldn't do that.

3243
02:34:35,220 --> 02:34:36,053
Yeah,
there's no way we couldn't do joe beef 

3244
02:34:37,001 --> 02:34:39,010
anywhere else.
People don't eat.

3245
02:34:39,550 --> 02:34:42,430
The dining public doesn't exist unless,
unless it's on my street.

3246
02:34:42,460 --> 02:34:44,320
So Montreal is just such a different 
place.

3247
02:34:44,840 --> 02:34:49,180
The idea is like when before they 
offered any a room there,

3248
02:34:49,240 --> 02:34:50,073
I said,
is there like a decommission laundromat 

3249
02:34:53,620 --> 02:34:54,453
in the back?
That's where employees only that reset 

3250
02:34:56,890 --> 02:34:57,723
all the wrong things mad at 800 square 
feet that we can make a five table 

3251
02:35:01,181 --> 02:35:04,120
French restaurant.
They're pitching us the top floor of the

3252
02:35:04,121 --> 02:35:04,954
palms and we're asking for the door next
to the garbage container in the alley 

3253
02:35:08,200 --> 02:35:09,033
with no windows and they were looking at
us like we're insane table for trust 

3254
02:35:13,690 --> 02:35:17,570
rather than his brother and his brother 
was looking at Lorenzo like,

3255
02:35:18,550 --> 02:35:22,330
fuck,
we sent them some books.

3256
02:35:22,330 --> 02:35:27,160
Now I'm sure they're happy.
He's such a funny,

3257
02:35:27,370 --> 02:35:30,240
funny way of responding to that.
We want to give you the top four,

3258
02:35:30,260 --> 02:35:31,093
the palms in Vegas.
Do you have for fucking 800 hundred 

3259
02:35:34,130 --> 02:35:37,150
square foot room and the back alley that
nobody could access?

3260
02:35:37,900 --> 02:35:38,733
I wouldn't make it so expensive that 
basketball players think it's too much 

3261
02:35:40,751 --> 02:35:43,240
money.
Well,

3262
02:35:43,241 --> 02:35:47,200
that would be a very interesting spot 
and I'm sure it would if,

3263
02:35:47,210 --> 02:35:48,043
if you did create something like that or
someone did an unbelievably exclusive 

3264
02:35:52,631 --> 02:35:53,464
spot that literally has 20 seats 
available in a night and they only open 

3265
02:35:57,911 --> 02:36:01,360
for one sitting right there and we want 
to build the.

3266
02:36:01,390 --> 02:36:03,520
What's the,
the movie the Roxbury.

3267
02:36:04,390 --> 02:36:08,300
We want to build the French connection.
That restaurant all the other one with j

3268
02:36:08,301 --> 02:36:09,134
dot lo.
What's that one?

3269
02:36:09,910 --> 02:36:13,770
Gigli.
Ishtar made major Manhattan.

3270
02:36:14,640 --> 02:36:15,473
Yeah,
I mean I guarantee if someone did do 

3271
02:36:18,161 --> 02:36:20,080
something like that,
particularly because of Vegas,

3272
02:36:20,081 --> 02:36:21,900
it's all about who you know and who you.

3273
02:36:21,910 --> 02:36:23,080
I mean,
if you can get in,

3274
02:36:23,440 --> 02:36:25,360
you know,
you can get into Joe Lamb.

3275
02:36:25,810 --> 02:36:27,610
Oh,
it's Joe Lammas in Vegas.

3276
02:36:27,611 --> 02:36:30,310
It's right behind the garbage container.
The leaky one.

3277
02:36:30,311 --> 02:36:31,720
Next to the grease trap.
Yeah.

3278
02:36:31,750 --> 02:36:35,080
Girls and they're Jimmy Choo's have to 
step through these puddles of greys.

3279
02:36:35,170 --> 02:36:39,910
Louboutin on their way to the back.
Then it would,

3280
02:36:40,060 --> 02:36:40,893
ironically enough,
it would be probably the hot spot in 

3281
02:36:43,601 --> 02:36:44,830
Vegas.
I know Joel,

3282
02:36:44,930 --> 02:36:45,763
what?
Lorenzo didn't get it probably wouldn't 

3283
02:36:48,191 --> 02:36:51,100
be very profitable though.
I mean obviously.

3284
02:36:51,250 --> 02:36:53,320
Well when they took over the palms,
I was excited.

3285
02:36:53,860 --> 02:36:56,560
I know that nine steakhouse there was 
excellent.

3286
02:36:56,620 --> 02:36:58,900
I haven't been there in years,
but I used to be a great place,

3287
02:36:59,200 --> 02:37:00,880
but mark was there.
Mark Veggies,

3288
02:37:00,930 --> 02:37:01,763
an excellent cook.
He's really involved in like solid 

3289
02:37:04,991 --> 02:37:07,810
charity things.
I think he's also brown or black belt in

3290
02:37:07,820 --> 02:37:09,170
Jujitsu.
Really?

3291
02:37:09,190 --> 02:37:09,691
Yeah.
Yeah,

3292
02:37:09,691 --> 02:37:10,390
yeah,
yeah.

3293
02:37:10,390 --> 02:37:13,030
He's a veteran guy.
Resourceful dude.

3294
02:37:13,070 --> 02:37:14,330
Wow.
So did he.

3295
02:37:14,331 --> 02:37:15,980
So he is the restaurant

3296
02:37:15,980 --> 02:37:19,460
open A.
I think this week it was a swing or.

3297
02:37:19,461 --> 02:37:20,480
Yeah.
Oh Wow.

3298
02:37:20,770 --> 02:37:22,370
That's fantastic.
That's awesome.

3299
02:37:22,870 --> 02:37:24,500
Wow.
And his food is delicious.

3300
02:37:25,100 --> 02:37:25,933
Try it out.
Yeah.

3301
02:37:26,400 --> 02:37:27,233
Yeah.
Batteries in Philadelphia as an 

3302
02:37:27,981 --> 02:37:30,120
institution.
We opened like a.

3303
02:37:30,240 --> 02:37:33,120
There was one thing when,
when we.

3304
02:37:33,290 --> 02:37:34,123
What was this?
What was the story of the lobster 

3305
02:37:34,851 --> 02:37:36,350
spaghetti?
You know,

3306
02:37:36,380 --> 02:37:37,213
we took that kind of like,
there was a story in Bon appetit 

3307
02:37:38,750 --> 02:37:39,583
magazine about love at my mark vettery 
doing lobster Spaghetti and fighting 

3308
02:37:43,641 --> 02:37:47,350
with his dad about removing a table to 
put a meat slicer in reading.

3309
02:37:47,530 --> 02:37:51,140
They have 24 seats and he bought a nice 
red slicer and he said,

3310
02:37:51,141 --> 02:37:53,660
we're taking out four seats and now 
we're down to 20 seats.

3311
02:37:53,860 --> 02:37:57,700
His Dad thought he was insane ad,
but he insisted that you know,

3312
02:37:57,800 --> 02:37:59,800
they have 20 seats instead of 24.
We.

3313
02:37:59,840 --> 02:38:03,140
That story was endearing to Fred and I 
and he was doing a lobster.

3314
02:38:03,140 --> 02:38:05,270
Spaghetti is Philadelphia restaurant at 
the time.

3315
02:38:05,271 --> 02:38:06,104
So when we open joe beef,
one of the first items on the menu was 

3316
02:38:08,181 --> 02:38:12,350
our version of the lobster spaghetti 
that mark vettery was doing.

3317
02:38:13,190 --> 02:38:16,510
And just a simple homage to that story.
Later,

3318
02:38:17,020 --> 02:38:20,390
years later we met him and we told them 
the story and became friends.

3319
02:38:20,870 --> 02:38:24,170
That's amazing.
So why did it take for seats?

3320
02:38:24,190 --> 02:38:25,580
What does,
what does this thing look like?

3321
02:38:25,790 --> 02:38:26,120
Well,
you know,

3322
02:38:26,120 --> 02:38:29,450
you seen those big Italian red burchell 
a meat slicers.

3323
02:38:29,510 --> 02:38:31,070
No,
Berkeley.

3324
02:38:32,300 --> 02:38:33,133
So did he do it?
Just because it would add to the 

3325
02:38:34,101 --> 02:38:36,350
ambiance to have this cool thing in 
Italy.

3326
02:38:36,351 --> 02:38:39,940
This is a pretty standard piece of 
equipment that you'd have on the bars.

3327
02:38:40,370 --> 02:38:44,360
Does it turns slow?
It's a big blade that rotates slowly.

3328
02:38:44,420 --> 02:38:45,350
Very,
very sharp.

3329
02:38:45,351 --> 02:38:47,240
So it doesn't a pinwheel.
Yeah.

3330
02:38:47,250 --> 02:38:49,550
It doesn't melt the fat of the Ham.

3331
02:38:49,640 --> 02:38:51,260
Right.
So you don't get this white film.

3332
02:38:51,530 --> 02:38:55,850
So it makes like perfectly thin cool 
slices of perfect ham.

3333
02:38:55,910 --> 02:38:56,743
Either a gorgeous objects like we have a
couple now we have a blue one and we 

3334
02:39:00,831 --> 02:39:03,520
have a red one.
They're gorgeous for me.

3335
02:39:03,540 --> 02:39:06,140
Jamie.
Cutting meat.

3336
02:39:06,730 --> 02:39:10,160
That one's nice.
Oh Wow.

3337
02:39:11,120 --> 02:39:13,490
Oh,
you know I saw one of these in Italy.

3338
02:39:13,610 --> 02:39:14,091
Yeah,
sure.

3339
02:39:14,091 --> 02:39:15,530
They're all over the place.
Yeah.

3340
02:39:15,630 --> 02:39:17,990
When,
when I was in Italy I saw one of these.

3341
02:39:17,991 --> 02:39:20,000
There were,
there were making sandwiches with it.

3342
02:39:20,340 --> 02:39:23,460
Yeah.
But that's 10,000,

3343
02:39:23,490 --> 02:39:25,130
$15,000
machine.

3344
02:39:25,790 --> 02:39:26,623
So when you,
when you removed four seats from your 

3345
02:39:28,101 --> 02:39:31,160
restaurant and put one of those in,
you kind of like,

3346
02:39:31,250 --> 02:39:32,420
you know,
it's stepping up.

3347
02:39:32,430 --> 02:39:35,170
You're on the wrong side of business.
Job Point.

3348
02:39:35,540 --> 02:39:38,010
You're on the right side of business.
Um,

3349
02:39:38,060 --> 02:39:39,380
you guys have something going on 
tonight,

3350
02:39:39,381 --> 02:39:40,350
right?
No,

3351
02:39:40,380 --> 02:39:41,120
no,
no,

3352
02:39:41,120 --> 02:39:41,953
no,
no.

3353
02:39:42,320 --> 02:39:43,153
We did last night.
We cooked that animal last night in Las 

3354
02:39:44,560 --> 02:39:45,021
Vegas.
That was cool.

3355
02:39:45,021 --> 02:39:46,000
Yeah,
those guys are great.

3356
02:39:46,001 --> 02:39:49,220
It's awesome.
And then they were never been.

3357
02:39:49,290 --> 02:39:50,610
Yeah.
And things.

3358
02:39:50,890 --> 02:39:52,100
Yeah,
they're good boys.

3359
02:39:52,101 --> 02:39:52,934
They have John and vinny is across the 
street animals at restaurant that kind 

3360
02:39:54,931 --> 02:39:56,540
of opened around the same time.
Joe Beef,

3361
02:39:56,990 --> 02:39:58,870
we were friends back then.
Uh,

3362
02:39:58,910 --> 02:40:00,440
they came up to Montreal a bunch of 
times.

3363
02:40:00,441 --> 02:40:02,720
I brought them to all the weird.
We're all kindred spirits.

3364
02:40:02,780 --> 02:40:07,430
It's like the same day they did the 
restaurant business,

3365
02:40:07,431 --> 02:40:09,080
like we practiced the restaurant 
business.

3366
02:40:09,081 --> 02:40:14,081
The restaurant is so similar to ours and
weird ways and their John and vinny

3367
02:40:14,160 --> 02:40:15,450
is a very.
Dave and Fred.

3368
02:40:15,451 --> 02:40:16,284
It's strange,
like it's a law if you have these sort 

3369
02:40:19,291 --> 02:40:22,500
of connections with these fellow 
likeminded chefs.

3370
02:40:22,980 --> 02:40:25,020
All the pirates.
Antonis captain.

3371
02:40:25,080 --> 02:40:27,750
Tony's pirate ship man.
Yeah.

3372
02:40:27,810 --> 02:40:29,520
Well he was the one who introduced me to
you guys.

3373
02:40:29,870 --> 02:40:32,070
Yeah.
You told me about you guys listen,

3374
02:40:32,510 --> 02:40:33,480
uh,
Joe beef,

3375
02:40:34,020 --> 02:40:36,180
surviving the apocalypse.
Is it out now?

3376
02:40:36,590 --> 02:40:39,190
Computer a week.
Twenty fourth,

24th.
So vendor,

3378

You fucks sorry,

3379
02:40:42,750 --> 02:40:44,670
but you're going to have to wait,
but please go out,

3380
02:40:44,720 --> 02:40:45,720

Support.

3381
02:40:45,900 --> 02:40:48,660
