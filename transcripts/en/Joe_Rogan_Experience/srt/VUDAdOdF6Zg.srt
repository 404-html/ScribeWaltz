1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,410
I could keep it in check for three,
two,

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,440
and we're live.
First of all,

3
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:08,760
Steve,
thank you very much for doing this.

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:09,830
I really appreciate it.
Oh,

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,840
thank you for having me.
I've been a big fan of your work for a 

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:14,840
long time and um,
you,

7
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,700
you bring up some really fascinating 
subjects and we were talking right 

8
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:23,091
before the podcast about social media 
and how weird it is that you got lumped 

9
00:00:23,641 --> 00:00:28,641
in with the outright for a comment 
saying something along the lines of that

10
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:35,210
you find what was the exact quote 
something along the highly intelligent 

11
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,890
people seem to,
which is not saying they're good people.

12
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:38,490
No,
that's right.

13
00:00:38,491 --> 00:00:43,491
And I think a lot of people who are 
ignorant to the outright equate them 

14
00:00:43,681 --> 00:00:44,490
with a,
uh,

15
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,850
the skinheads and the Neo Nazis carrying
the Tiki torches.

16
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,660
But when I was referring strictly to the
outright from its origin in internet 

17
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:54,840
discussion groups and I,
you know,

18
00:00:54,841 --> 00:00:55,650
I,
I know some of them,

19
00:00:55,651 --> 00:01:00,651
some of them are former students and 
some of them are highly intelligent and 

20
00:01:00,651 --> 00:01:01,380
highly read.
So,

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,100
uh,
but,

22
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,770
but that's not what people often think 
of when they think of the alt right.

23
00:01:04,771 --> 00:01:06,070
And that's what I was referring to.
I certainly,

24
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:11,120
there are people in tech,
there's some people in universities is 

25
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,120
stay under cover.
And uh,

26
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,570
I was,
uh,

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,400
made some remarks on how to starve that 
movement,

28
00:01:14,401 --> 00:01:15,880
not how to feed it,
but

29
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,850
so many people jumped on it as if you 
were endorsing the alt right.

30
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,860
It was the exact quote you were just 
basically saying something along the 

31
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,420
lines of there's a lot of intelligent 
people that are involved in this.

32
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:31,730
Well,
it wasn't so much that it was also that 

33
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:31,730
because of the,
uh,

34
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:35,420
uh,
the various taboos in mainstream 

35
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,180
intellectual culture because of 
political correctness,

36
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,760
there's certain things that are just 
kind of not discussable,

37
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,890
but then when people in the outright 
discover them,

38
00:01:40,891 --> 00:01:45,891
they feel tremendously empowered.
Like we are now privy to the truth that 

39
00:01:45,891 --> 00:01:47,310
the establishment can't handle.
You can't handle the truth.

40
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:50,760
And since it was never discussed in the 
open,

41
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,420
there are no counterarguments to some of
the most toxic interpretations.

42
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:59,310
And so the outright can run with the 
never having been in a forum where these

43
00:01:59,311 --> 00:02:01,890
things that are debated and criticized 
and put it into context,

44
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,490
they take like one fact and then they 
draw the most extreme conclusions.

45
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,620
If these things were debated in the 
first place,

46
00:02:07,621 --> 00:02:11,010
then you'd realize that those 
conclusions are not warranted.

47
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:11,550
Oh,
it's.

48
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:16,650
I mean an example is there are average 
differences between men and women and a 

49
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,900
lot of psychological traits now if 
that's.

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,790
And that's often quite taboo in 
intellectual circles for I think bizarre

51
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:28,791
reasons.
So I had to get people who think that 

52
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:29,580
somehow women's rights depend on men and
women being indistinguishable.

53
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,490
I think it's a bad equation in the first
place,

54
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:37,940
but as soon as you come across the fact 
that men and women on average are,

55
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:44,090
are different.
You also come across the fact that men 

56
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:44,820
and women overlap in a lot of these 
traits that whatever trait you name,

57
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,450
that men on average are better at that 
women or vice versa.

58
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,420
There are a lot of women who are better 
than a lot of men or vice versa,

59
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,410
and so you can't really judge an 
individual from the average of,

60
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:56,340
uh,
their,

61
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,480
their,
their sex.

62
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:02,810
Also,
even though there are some traits where 

63
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,251
men score a little better than women,
there some traits were women score a 

64
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:05,320
little better than men and that that's 
the complete picture.

65
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,380
But the thing is that if the entire 
subject is out of bounds,

66
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,360
you never get to present the complete 
picture.

67
00:03:10,361 --> 00:03:12,910
And some people run away with all men 
and women are totally different.

68
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:16,060
What are your thoughts on how the 
subject got out of bounds?

69
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:21,300
Because it's very confusing to me that 
certain subjects like the differences 

70
00:03:22,721 --> 00:03:26,710
between genders are so taboo when they 
seem so obvious.

71
00:03:26,711 --> 00:03:31,711
I mean,
you just could go to a mall and just 

72
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:31,850
look at the way the men dress and the 
women dress and you go,

73
00:03:31,851 --> 00:03:33,220
well,
there's some obvious distinctions here.

74
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,230
There's a history to it because there 
were,

75
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:40,240
there were a lot of khaki,
maybe theories and the 19th century,

76
00:03:40,241 --> 00:03:45,241
and in a lot of the 20th century that 
men were intellectual and women were not

77
00:03:45,371 --> 00:03:50,371
in.
Women were governed by their emotions 

78
00:03:50,371 --> 00:03:52,121
and their women thought too much.
It would take blood away from their 

79
00:03:52,121 --> 00:03:55,871
ovaries and their womb and they wouldn't
be fertile and then they'd be all 

80
00:03:55,871 --> 00:03:55,871
miserable.
I mean really like crazy stuff.

81
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:00,200
And as a reaction to that,
in the seventies when the second wave of

82
00:04:00,201 --> 00:04:05,201
feminism became prominent,
it became almost an article of faith 

83
00:04:05,201 --> 00:04:06,350
that there were no differences between 
men and women.

84
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,680
Uh,
and so if you say that there are 

85
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:11,680
differences between men and women,
you're sending women back to the,

86
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,450
to the kitchen in the nursery.
So this is a total non sequitur because 

87
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,960
fairness is not the same as sameness.

88
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,960
So obviously women should have equal 
rights to men,

89
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:25,820
whether or not they're exact copies of 
men or have a distinctive profile as men

90
00:04:25,821 --> 00:04:28,520
have a distinct profile.
So I think it's just a mistake to,

91
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:34,060
uh,
to conflate the issue of women's rights 

92
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,480
with men and women being identical,
but that's the way it kind of shook out 

93
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,720
and it became kind of an article of 
faith in a,

94
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,320
in a lot of,
in some feminist,

95
00:04:42,321 --> 00:04:45,770
some kind of left liberal circles that 
men and women have to be identical.

96
00:04:45,771 --> 00:04:47,870
And if they aren't,
that means you're a trader you to,

97
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,160
to a women's equality.

98
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:54,480
Yeah.
And the articles of faith are always 

99
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:54,480
dangerous.
Dangerous,

100
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,091
especially in that regard.
It's articles of fairness are always 

101
00:04:57,091 --> 00:04:57,091
important.
I mean,

102
00:04:57,091 --> 00:05:00,250
fair being fair to each other and being 
fair is also recognizing differences.

103
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,960
That's right.
And not assuming that any differences a 

104
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,181
deficiency,
if you're really doing an honest 

105
00:05:08,181 --> 00:05:08,820
comparison of the differences between 
men and women,

106
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,230
men wouldn't come out looking so good.

107
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:11,990
Right?
No.

108
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:17,640
Yeah.
I have a whole bit about that in my act 

109
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,340
when we're looking at the reaction to 
this though.

110
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:23,520
What was strange to me was how many 
people seemed like they wanted to jump 

111
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,481
on board and criticize you.
And I think a lot of it is almost like 

112
00:05:27,521 --> 00:05:30,490
to take away some of the potential 
criticism of themselves,

113
00:05:30,491 --> 00:05:35,491
like it's instant claiming of the moral 
high ground virtue signaling and it's 

114
00:05:35,491 --> 00:05:40,231
just very disappointing when you see 
this from intellectuals and college 

115
00:05:40,231 --> 00:05:41,470
professors and it should know better.
I

116
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,150
mean,
to be fair,

117
00:05:42,151 --> 00:05:45,050
I did not get into much trouble from,
from,

118
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:50,070
you know,
my peers and among the professors and 

119
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,270
Grad students and so on.
There are a couple of trolls who,

120
00:05:50,271 --> 00:05:50,790
uh,
who,

121
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,410
who ran with it,
but by and large,

122
00:05:52,411 --> 00:05:55,550
the mainstream reaction was,
this is almost a sign of a,

123
00:05:55,551 --> 00:05:57,480
as a New York Times put it,
that social is made

124
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,540
stupid.
Yeah.

125
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:01,480
That was the article,
the name of the title of the article and

126
00:06:01,481 --> 00:06:01,870
the time.

127
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,090
Yeah.
So it was by and large,

128
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:04,750
uh,
you know,

129
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:05,980
I came out of it.
Okay.

130
00:06:05,981 --> 00:06:10,981
But it was a real indication of how 
these mobs of outrage can corrupt any 

131
00:06:11,201 --> 00:06:11,920
kind of intelligence

132
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:12,960
discourse.
Yeah.

133
00:06:12,961 --> 00:06:14,880
Well,
subtle discussions,

134
00:06:14,881 --> 00:06:19,881
the discussions that involve nuanced,
complicated issues that are there.

135
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:25,210
They're complex.
They require a long dis sort of 

136
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:28,110
description of the issue.
And I'll,

137
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:33,180
I'll a very complex sort of take on 
these various differences between men 

138
00:06:35,221 --> 00:06:38,690
and women and the alt right and the left
and political director.

139
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,590
These are,
these are long discussions.

140
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:45,620
I mean these aren't something that you 
can smash into a very short sound 

141
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,790
soundbite and completely cover your take
on things

142
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,880
hold the more reason that they shouldn't
be taboo because if you can't discuss 

143
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,450
them then the only interpretation you're
going to have as the simplistic one.

144
00:06:54,451 --> 00:06:59,451
If you could bring them out in the open,
then you can start to have that 

145
00:06:59,451 --> 00:06:59,451
discussion.

146
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:00,560
Yeah.
I'm hoping that this is turning around.

147
00:07:00,561 --> 00:07:03,920
I'm hoping that what's happened is the 
outrage culture,

148
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:08,950
the outrage culture has become almost a 
parody of itself has gotten so 

149
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:12,311
ridiculous that people will sort of shy 
away from outrage seemingly like the 

150
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:18,041
same reason why people are terrified of 
talking about the differences between 

151
00:07:19,281 --> 00:07:24,281
men and women is because they don't want
to be grouped into the people that 

152
00:07:24,281 --> 00:07:28,410
literally are legitimately rather were 
sexist in the,

153
00:07:28,411 --> 00:07:29,040
the,
you know,

154
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:34,090
the 19 hundreds and the 18 hundreds.
And these people that did have these 

155
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:37,511
terrible ideas.
So now we're trying to go so far away 

156
00:07:37,511 --> 00:07:38,570
from that that we've become a little bit
ridiculous and I'm hoping things,

157
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:43,620
I'm hoping it's a swing and they'll just
kind of bounce back towards the middle 

158
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:43,620
again.

159
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,060
Yeah.
And in fact,

160
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:47,420
there is some hope that that would.
Eddie medium is new,

161
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:52,930
there'll be these excesses and it takes 
awhile for the system to kind of re re 

162
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,670
equilibrate to have an immune response 
that damps down the worst of it.

163
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:03,930
I mean,
I've been on the Internet a long time 

164
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,501
and in the eighties when it was mainly 
academics and computer scientists who 

165
00:08:05,501 --> 00:08:06,500
are on the Internet,
there are these discussion groups.

166
00:08:06,501 --> 00:08:11,501
This was before the worldwide web,
so it was all text and there's this 

167
00:08:11,501 --> 00:08:11,570
concept of,
of flaming.

168
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:16,600
Yeah.
I don't know if the word is all days.

169
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,720
Well,
it came from the,

170
00:08:17,721 --> 00:08:22,721
uh,
there was an award given a jokey award 

171
00:08:22,721 --> 00:08:23,810
called it the flaming asshole award.
Oh really?

172
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,700
And the,
the,

173
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:25,460
uh,
to the,

174
00:08:25,461 --> 00:08:26,030
the,
the,

175
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,500
the worst insult or in these 
intellectual discussions.

176
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:31,270
And the,
the uh,

177
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,040
uh,
the,

178
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,700
the trophy was supposedly his bestest 
cork,

179
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,240
but from the flaming asshole award there
was the,

180
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:39,930
the,
the,

181
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:43,010
the flame,
the adjective flame wars,

182
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:48,040
the verb to flame dam down.
As people became aware of flaming as a 

183
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,480
phenomenon in the discussion groups,
it was,

184
00:08:50,481 --> 00:08:55,481
well,
let's not turn this into a flame war or 

185
00:08:55,481 --> 00:08:55,800
in flames.
And when people realized that this was a

186
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:56,280
thing,

187
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:01,550
then they could push back against it.
And let's hope that that happens with 

188
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:01,550
this social media again.
Yeah,

189
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:06,111
I hope so.
It was a sport in like the late 

190
00:09:06,111 --> 00:09:06,111
nineties,
early two thousands.

191
00:09:06,111 --> 00:09:07,710
It was essentially like an online 
support.

192
00:09:07,711 --> 00:09:09,540
Like someone would say something about 
you and you'd go,

193
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,820
Oh crap.
And how do I attack this?

194
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,520
And it was,
it was more fun than anything.

195
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:20,521
And I felt like there was very few 
people relatively speaking,

196
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:26,091
involved in discussion groups back then 
in terms of like the mass amount of 

197
00:09:26,091 --> 00:09:30,201
people that are on social media now.
It's certainly like everyone is in some 

198
00:09:30,201 --> 00:09:34,251
form of,
or most people are in some form of 

199
00:09:34,251 --> 00:09:34,251
social media now.
Whereas back then,

200
00:09:34,251 --> 00:09:36,960
the number of people that were on 
message boards was so small.

201
00:09:36,961 --> 00:09:37,590
Yeah.
So smell.

202
00:09:37,591 --> 00:09:39,040
That's right.
And you're right there.

203
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:43,060
There is an art form of ritual insults 
in Shakespeare and you know,

204
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,670
African American snapping a there when 
people realize that this is a sport that

205
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,630
no one gets hurt.

206
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,520
It's just like,
you know,

207
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,660
right.
It's like martial arts,

208
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:56,690
it's part of the fun.
But the thing is that when it goes out 

209
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:57,060
of control and it really does attack 
people's reputations and then you've got

210
00:09:57,061 --> 00:10:02,061
a problem.
We have a thing in comedy called roast 

211
00:10:02,061 --> 00:10:02,061
battle.
Yeah.

212
00:10:02,061 --> 00:10:02,061
Roasting another example.
Yeah,

213
00:10:02,061 --> 00:10:04,290
absolutely.
And Roast battle is this,

214
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:09,291
uh,
this great show that they do at the 

215
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:09,780
comedy store.
Every Tuesday we're,

216
00:10:09,781 --> 00:10:13,710
comedians will prepare insults against 
each other.

217
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,210
But my friend Brian Moses who hosts it 
at the end of everything,

218
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,770
they always hug it out,
right?

219
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,010
Like,
it's always like,

220
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,080
no,
this is a joke,

221
00:10:22,081 --> 00:10:26,460
writing exercise and a fun joke writing 
show and no one really,

222
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:29,190
no one means any of this and not really 
mean.

223
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,930
It hugs me,
just like a,

224
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,860
like a professional boxing or ultimate 
fighting yourself.

225
00:10:34,861 --> 00:10:37,260
So whatever you can,
there are rules,

226
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:39,630
there's an arena and when you're done,
it's over.

227
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:44,630
You don't plot revenge,
but sometimes people can misunderstand 

228
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:48,741
it.
There's that famous press roast where a 

229
00:10:48,741 --> 00:10:52,060
Obama had some fun at the expense of 
Donald trump when he was still just a a,

230
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:57,070
a reality show and you could see 
famously the camera zoomed in on trump 

231
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:59,940
and he was not abused at jokes,
at his expense.

232
00:10:59,941 --> 00:11:02,190
And there's,
there's a theory that one of the reasons

233
00:11:02,191 --> 00:11:04,140
that he plotted his presidential run was
to,

234
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,730
was to get revenge.
Well,

235
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:08,070
that's one of the things that Obama said
during that roast,

236
00:11:08,071 --> 00:11:13,071
and here's one of the things that I am 
that you'll never be president of the 

237
00:11:13,071 --> 00:11:14,430
United States and crazy and cheered on 
history.

238
00:11:14,431 --> 00:11:19,431
We could have turned out very 
differently if he hadn't made that one 

239
00:11:19,431 --> 00:11:19,431
joke.
It's amazing,

240
00:11:19,431 --> 00:11:19,431
isn't it?
Well,

241
00:11:19,431 --> 00:11:23,871
yeah.
Apparently he had been thinking about 

242
00:11:23,871 --> 00:11:23,871
being president for a long,
long time,

243
00:11:23,871 --> 00:11:25,860
but that might,
might have been the straw that broke the

244
00:11:25,861 --> 00:11:28,020
camel's back.
So Barack,

245
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:33,021
what have you done when you see social 
media today,

246
00:11:35,131 --> 00:11:40,131
like as a psychologist and you see this 
thing that people do when they can 

247
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:44,880
behave anonymously in the absence of 
social cues,

248
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,330
not in front of each other,
not,

249
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:49,770
not seeing that.
How the cruel things hurt each other.

250
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:55,220
How does that make you do?
Do you think that this is just an 

251
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:55,220
unnatural

252
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:55,390
way of communicating?

253
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,830
Well,
there is something.

254
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:01,150
The anonymity is certainly a natural and
relaxed face to face contact.

255
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:06,210
And I think one of the big discoveries 
of psychology from over the last couple 

256
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:11,360
of decades is that we're moral animals 
to the extent that we have reputations.

257
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,000
Uh,
going,

258
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:15,520
going back to Richard Dawkins,
his famous book,

259
00:12:15,521 --> 00:12:17,680
the selfish gene where he posed the 
question,

260
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:22,980
how could niceness in generosity and 
cooperation evolve given that in 

261
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:26,080
Darwinian competition you'd expect the 
most aggressive,

262
00:12:26,081 --> 00:12:31,081
the most selfish to predominate.
And there's an answer to that question 

263
00:12:31,081 --> 00:12:32,680
in Docklands,
worked it out back in 1976 based on work

264
00:12:32,681 --> 00:12:34,180
of other biologists,
which is,

265
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,910
if there is reciprocity,
that is,

266
00:12:36,911 --> 00:12:41,911
if I,
I remember the nice things that you did 

267
00:12:41,911 --> 00:12:42,750
to me and I feel compelled to,
uh,

268
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:43,840
to,
to repay them.

269
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:48,870
And conversely,
if you do something that harms me and I 

270
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:52,860
threatened revenge,
then people can kind of settle into 

271
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,920
cooperation because we really are better
off if we extend favorites to each other

272
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,070
that,
uh,

273
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:01,630
do a lot of good to the other in 
response to a fairly minor inconvenience

274
00:13:01,631 --> 00:13:02,200
to the self.

275
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,060
If everyone does that,
everyone is better off.

276
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,480
And that's only stable though if 
everyone has a memory for what everyone 

277
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:14,161
else did.
Therefore that sets up a pressure to 

278
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:16,890
cultivate your reputation as someone who
is trustworthy and will reciprocate at,

279
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:21,790
but without the reputation,
without the memory of who did what.

280
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:26,791
And uh,
and how generous and trustworthy someone

281
00:13:26,801 --> 00:13:28,870
is.
The whole thing can unravel when you get

282
00:13:28,871 --> 00:13:31,870
back to what people think of as 
Darwinian competition.

283
00:13:31,871 --> 00:13:34,110
Namely nature,
red in tooth and claw.

284
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,940
Just a bloody battle.
So reputation is really,

285
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:41,170
it's not just a matter of kind of ego or
burnishing your credentials,

286
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:44,170
that's really what makes all 
cooperation,

287
00:13:44,171 --> 00:13:49,171
niceness kindness a possible.
And so when you have an arena in which 

288
00:13:49,171 --> 00:13:49,690
the,
uh,

289
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:55,080
first of all you don't have face to face
contact so you don't have the kind of 

290
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,320
evolved responses that we have to,
to getting along a namely it's a,

291
00:13:59,411 --> 00:14:02,950
it's a big deal to a insult someone to 
their,

292
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:03,840
their,
their face.

293
00:14:03,841 --> 00:14:04,900
Some people do it,
but,

294
00:14:04,901 --> 00:14:06,610
uh,
you got to do it very carefully.

295
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,360
You take that away and it just,
you know,

296
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:13,410
typing a bunch of characters at a 
keyboard and especially if the person 

297
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:16,561
doing the typing has a handle,
they just anonymous then that kind of 

298
00:14:16,561 --> 00:14:20,730
eliminate some of the constraints on 
civility and generosity and then 

299
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,350
maintaining a reputation as a credible 
cooperator.

300
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,920
I also feel that there's a,
there's a selfishness and being nice and

301
00:14:29,081 --> 00:14:31,030
being generous because,
uh,

302
00:14:31,031 --> 00:14:34,480
the way I describe what I think it feels
good,

303
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,930
it feels good to be nice,
to be bold.

304
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:41,940
It feels good to be generous when you 
give someone a nice tip at a restaurant 

305
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:41,940
and they get happy,
like that feels good.

306
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:45,640
Like it's good for you too.
It's not just a one way street.

307
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:45,880
What

308
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,870
kind of a benign selfishness?
Yeah,

309
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,710
it's the kind that is,
although it's not,

310
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,710
uh,
the,

311
00:14:51,711 --> 00:14:56,711
the,
the irony is said it can't just really 

312
00:14:56,711 --> 00:14:57,920
be calculated if it's really that I just
do exactly as much.

313
00:14:57,921 --> 00:15:00,980
That gets me gratitude and recognition.
Then,

314
00:15:00,981 --> 00:15:02,330
you know,
other people see through that.

315
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:03,520
And so the,
I,

316
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:03,940
the,
the,

317
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:08,960
the paradox is that it's kind of got to 
be sincere for it to be credible to 

318
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:13,301
someone else for the most effective way 
to prove to someone else that you're a 

319
00:15:13,301 --> 00:15:16,190
nice guy is to actually be a nice guy 
because if you're just calculating,

320
00:15:16,191 --> 00:15:18,590
if you're just doing the bare minimum,
you can get away with.

321
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,720
Then since we're,
we're pretty good.

322
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,910
We're all pretty good.
Intuitive psychologists were always kind

323
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,040
of thing.
Did he really mean it?

324
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,860
Is he just kind of kissing up?
Is he trying to get,

325
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:29,270
you know,
curry favors and we see through that.

326
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:32,450
That's the person who actually isn't 
doing that calculation,

327
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,970
but we really admire and respect.
Right?

328
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,180
And it's very unusual.
It's one of the reasons why we admire,

329
00:15:38,181 --> 00:15:41,120
like look at this completely altruistic 
person.

330
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:41,720
Like,
I mean,

331
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:44,750
it's clearly remarket the marketplace,
have reputations,

332
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:48,890
kind of selects,
can select for true niceness.

333
00:15:48,891 --> 00:15:49,750
Goodness.
Yeah.

334
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:52,580
You've got enough information and enough
interactions.

335
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,370
I mean,
here's a crude analogy.

336
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:57,290
Um,
so in the business world,

337
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,240
uh,
you know,

338
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,560
you can have cutthroat fly by night 
businesses.

339
00:16:00,561 --> 00:16:05,561
They just try to squeeze everything out 
of the customers and then take off the 

340
00:16:05,561 --> 00:16:06,320
students.
The cheating is discovered,

341
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:07,940
you know,
they don't last very long.

342
00:16:07,941 --> 00:16:12,941
They don't actually make a lot of money.
It's often the companies that will take 

343
00:16:12,941 --> 00:16:13,640
back the product,
no questions asked,

344
00:16:13,641 --> 00:16:18,641
even if they lose a little bit of money,
but they earned the loyalty of their 

345
00:16:18,641 --> 00:16:18,641
customers.

346
00:16:18,641 --> 00:16:20,750
Those are the companies that often do 
the best and stick around the longest.

347
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,390
It's kind of an analogy to the way that 
being honorable,

348
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,090
even if you have little losses.
Well,

349
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,130
I did a little bit more for him than he 
did for me,

350
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:33,220
but over the long run,
that's what makes you desirable as 

351
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:33,220
someone who other people want to hang 
out with.

352
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,900
If the reputations can spread.
Yeah.

353
00:16:35,901 --> 00:16:40,901
It's kind of amazing.
If you think about how cherished true 

354
00:16:40,901 --> 00:16:44,090
generosity and kindness out cherished 
they are,

355
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,980
like it's a,
it's an amazing thing.

356
00:16:45,981 --> 00:16:50,020
Like you see people that are truly kind 
and truly generous and we've,

357
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,490
we value that so much.
It's kind of amazing.

358
00:16:52,491 --> 00:16:57,460
There aren't more of them because it's 
such a virtue that we admire and you,

359
00:16:57,461 --> 00:17:00,230
you,
if someone does behave in that manner,

360
00:17:00,231 --> 00:17:05,231
like people gravitate towards them.
It's like it's a real trait that is 

361
00:17:05,841 --> 00:17:06,860
attractive to people.

362
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:08,610
It is.
And there's a,

363
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,640
you know,
there's a misunderstanding of the 

364
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,310
evolutionary explanation of the,
uh,

365
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,490
of appearance,
of altruism and generosity.

366
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,330
I had a misunderstanding of,
of,

367
00:17:18,331 --> 00:17:23,331
uh,
the message that Dawkins conveyed in 

368
00:17:23,331 --> 00:17:25,481
that book that it predicts that we're 
all just kind of calculating a favorite 

369
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:28,620
traders that we do just enough to,
uh,

370
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:31,490
get a favor in return.
And if we don't think someone could help

371
00:17:31,491 --> 00:17:33,200
us in return,
then we just cut them off.

372
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:36,740
Kind of a cynical view of generosity.
But it's actually the reason that that's

373
00:17:36,741 --> 00:17:39,800
not true is that as soon as the game 
begins,

374
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:45,010
uh,
you kind of get to higher and higher 

375
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:45,010
levels of eat.
People psyching each other out,

376
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:48,380
seeing through them because it's,
if I have a choice between who I'm going

377
00:17:48,381 --> 00:17:50,190
to hang out with,
who's calling to be friend,

378
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:53,310
there's one person who's going to do 
exactly for what,

379
00:17:53,311 --> 00:17:55,740
for me,
what will help him in the long run.

380
00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:01,190
There's someone else who's really is 
generous and he's really going to help 

381
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:04,521
me.
And he said he's not going to keep a 

382
00:18:04,521 --> 00:18:04,521
long memory of who did what for whom.
Well,

383
00:18:04,521 --> 00:18:06,060
I'm going to pick the second guy and so 
he's going to actually be better off for

384
00:18:06,061 --> 00:18:10,640
being the better person.
Now that you can take that to an extreme

385
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:13,230
and it means that we're all infinitely 
generous,

386
00:18:13,231 --> 00:18:18,231
which of course we're not a.
and so there's kind of a tradeoff in 

387
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:18,930
equilibrium between,
you know,

388
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:23,931
not being a total sucker or not giving 
so much away that you just harm yourself

389
00:18:24,991 --> 00:18:29,700
in the long run and being the kind of 
person who is generous and honest enough

390
00:18:29,701 --> 00:18:31,650
that other people want to affiliate with
them.

391
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:35,100
And the reality is that all of us are 
probably mixtures.

392
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:37,410
I mean,
we're not cutthroat sociopath's.

393
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,700
Most of us have,
some of us are a nora.

394
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:45,150
We are totally a sane self sacrificing 
saints.

395
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:50,180
We're somewhere in between and different
people are at different points in that 

396
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:50,180
continuum.

397
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,080
When you look at social media and you 
look at this,

398
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:52,950
uh,
this,

399
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:55,530
the,
the nastiness that's so common,

400
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:00,720
um,
and obviously in some ways it's got to 

401
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,100
be connected to the ability to be 
anonymous.

402
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:07,700
But I feel like I've thought of this 
more and more lately that this 

403
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,220
negativity is as probably a temporary 
thing.

404
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,760
I feel like people are realizing that 
this isn't an unnatural way of 

405
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:21,231
communicating and that it's so relative,
really relatively recent in human 

406
00:19:21,231 --> 00:19:23,160
history and such a small window.
I mean 19,

407
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:28,161
94 is essentially when people started 
getting online and here we are in 2018 

408
00:19:28,161 --> 00:19:30,360
and you're seeing people switching to 
flip phones,

409
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:36,470
deleting their facebook.
It's a very common thing and almost a 

410
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:40,191
chic thing to do,
like people were talking about it on a 

411
00:19:40,191 --> 00:19:40,191
regular basis.
All Man.

412
00:19:40,191 --> 00:19:40,191
I.
Yeah,

413
00:19:40,191 --> 00:19:42,090
I just get email.
I check it once a day and that's it.

414
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,110
Yeah.
No,

415
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,200
I think that's right.
We're there.

416
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:46,300
Whenever there's a new technological 
innovation,

417
00:19:46,301 --> 00:19:51,301
it takes society awhile to adjust to it 
and say people got online in 1994 with 

418
00:19:51,741 --> 00:19:53,560
social media or even more recent than 
that.

419
00:19:53,561 --> 00:19:58,561
It's more probably like smartphones 
started to become ubiquitous around 

420
00:19:58,561 --> 00:20:00,940
maybe 2011 and facebook took off in the 
two thousands,

421
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:06,150
but yeah,
I think that's right and similar things 

422
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:06,150
happened in when other media were 
introduced.

423
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:10,640
There was a big panic when television 
came in that families would never talk 

424
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,960
to each other,
they'd all be staring at the screen like

425
00:20:13,961 --> 00:20:18,961
zombies and you'd never have a 
conversation over the dinner table ever 

426
00:20:18,961 --> 00:20:18,961
again.
Even before that,

427
00:20:18,961 --> 00:20:20,680
when telephones were invented,
it was,

428
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,710
you know,
families who'd never a sit down together

429
00:20:23,711 --> 00:20:28,711
because the phone constantly be ringing 
in attention spans would be disrupted 

430
00:20:28,711 --> 00:20:32,821
because the phone could ring anytime.
Was there similar conversation about 

431
00:20:32,821 --> 00:20:32,860
books?
Actually there was,

432
00:20:32,861 --> 00:20:33,820
yeah.
And about writing,

433
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:36,070
going back to the ancient Greeks,
uh,

434
00:20:36,071 --> 00:20:36,970
who were,
uh,

435
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:42,150
when,
when writing was considered to be kind 

436
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:42,150
of um,
uh,

437
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:46,870
you know,
degenerate and decadent because you 

438
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:46,870
know,
you,

439
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,190
you'd let your memory go to pot to know 
how are people to cultivate their 

440
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:52,681
memory.
They could just write things down and 

441
00:20:52,681 --> 00:20:52,681
look at them.

442
00:20:52,681 --> 00:20:52,681
That's crazy.
Is that interesting?

443
00:20:52,681 --> 00:20:57,000
Why do you think we were always looking 
to dismiss some new fantastic 

444
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,430
technology?

445
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,440
It's partly because we don't understand 
it yet.

446
00:21:00,441 --> 00:21:05,441
I mean it's new and also a lot of the 
adjustments that you were just talking 

447
00:21:05,441 --> 00:21:05,441
about,
you know,

448
00:21:05,441 --> 00:21:07,250
you can't really predict them 
beforehand.

449
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:12,580
A lot of what happens in a society is 
there like hundreds of little 

450
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:16,811
adjustments that people make.
Not Spend too much time on facebook or 

451
00:21:16,811 --> 00:21:20,690
email and leave this platform for that 
platform where if you were starting from

452
00:21:20,691 --> 00:21:23,780
scratch and asked to kind of imagine how
it's going to play out,

453
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,210
you can't really anticipate these 
things.

454
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:31,330
Uh,
it's like thousands of adjustments that 

455
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:33,881
people make.
They happen when they happen with 

456
00:21:33,881 --> 00:21:34,990
billions of people making decisions.
Uh,

457
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:38,420
but you,
you can't just deduce them beforehand,

458
00:21:38,421 --> 00:21:40,730
like a logical proof.
And so we just don't know.

459
00:21:40,731 --> 00:21:45,731
We know what the threat is.
We don't know what society's 

460
00:21:45,731 --> 00:21:45,731
responsibility.

461
00:21:45,731 --> 00:21:49,210
Maybe whether this a fascinating time 
when it comes to social media and just 

462
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:50,370
human interaction because this is so 
new.

463
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,880
And because it's uncharted territory.
I mean,

464
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:57,890
I think this is one of the reasons why 
so many people have so many concerns 

465
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:57,890
about it.
They're like,

466
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:57,890
where's this?
Where's this going?

467
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,660
What's it gonna do to our children?
We walked down the street and everyone's

468
00:22:00,661 --> 00:22:03,610
just staring at their phone.
Really is I,

469
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:08,620
I've said this,
that imagine if there was a drug that 

470
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,590
came along that this drug made you only 
think about the drug.

471
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,890
You were,
uh,

472
00:22:11,891 --> 00:22:15,360
you were likely more likely to get into 
car accidents because this drug,

473
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:19,330
you're more likely to sleep late,
cause more anxiety and,

474
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:23,730
and soak up immense amounts of your time
with very little reward for it.

475
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:24,820
You would go,
wow.

476
00:22:24,821 --> 00:22:27,390
What kind of crazy drugs this,
it's robbing people of their lives.

477
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,720
Well,
that's cell phones,

478
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,310
that's social media.
I mean it does give you something.

479
00:22:32,311 --> 00:22:37,311
I mean if you use it correctly.
Most of the time I try to spend on 

480
00:22:37,311 --> 00:22:38,560
social media.
I try to spend or most of the time on,

481
00:22:38,561 --> 00:22:40,890
on my phone I try to spend off social 
media,

482
00:22:40,891 --> 00:22:44,310
but reading things like tried to read 
articles and I try to,

483
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:47,250
I try to in some way justify like,
oh,

484
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:49,080
I'm doing something productive on my 
phone.

485
00:22:49,081 --> 00:22:52,980
But a lot of ways I'm just addicted to 
checking that thing.

486
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,220
Yeah,

487
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:58,450
you got,
you have to develop habits of self 

488
00:22:58,450 --> 00:22:59,370
control and balancing life.
I had a student,

489
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:04,380
so I teach at Harvard and what time of 
freshmen came into my office beginning 

490
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,320
of the semester,
so she looked at the shelf of books that

491
00:23:06,321 --> 00:23:07,160
she really said,
wow,

492
00:23:07,161 --> 00:23:12,161
professor pinker,
how do you find time to write so many 

493
00:23:12,161 --> 00:23:12,161
books,
and then she looks at my office and sees

494
00:23:12,161 --> 00:23:14,240
all the books on my shelves.
Wow.

495
00:23:14,241 --> 00:23:19,241
Professor Pinker,
how do you have time to read so many 

496
00:23:19,241 --> 00:23:19,241
books?
And she paused for a second.

497
00:23:19,241 --> 00:23:20,750
He said,
I bet you're not on facebook,

498
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:29,100
but this got to be some good that comes 
out of those communities as well 

499
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:29,770
throughout the baby with the bathwater,
undoubtedly.

500
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:30,800
Yeah,
absolutely.

501
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:33,790
And you know,
I confess I'm on twitter.

502
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:38,940
I sometimes look at my twitter feed and 
I learned really interesting stuff from 

503
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:38,940
it,
but I also say,

504
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,000
okay,
enough,

505
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,750
get back to work,
get back to reading,

506
00:23:41,751 --> 00:23:43,780
go outside.
See some friends,

507
00:23:43,781 --> 00:23:45,010
spent some time with,
with uh,

508
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:45,830
with your family.

509
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,810
Yeah.
I will go down twitter hall.

510
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:53,110
I went down to twitter whole yesterday 
about these Mont New Mayan Ruins that 

511
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:56,651
they found in Guatemala who amazing,
crazy thousands of structures swallowed 

512
00:23:56,651 --> 00:23:58,310
up by time.
And they're just now realizing like,

513
00:23:58,311 --> 00:23:59,480
oh my God,
this was a city.

514
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:02,570
So that stuff's good.
Yeah,

515
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:04,210
no,
absolutely man.

516
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:09,220
It's a question of are all finding the 
balance between getting the advantages 

517
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:09,220
or disadvantages?
Well,

518
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,430
it's just so new.
Yeah.

519
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,880
When,
when you see all so much negativity 

520
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,440
though,
and this is a big problem with anonymous

521
00:24:18,441 --> 00:24:20,870
accounts in particular,
you see it in facebook,

522
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,780
in facebook,
there seems to be repercussions.

523
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:28,400
Like if you're Tom Smith and Tom Smith 
writes something horrible,

524
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:30,530
like Tom Smith could get fired from his 
job for it.

525
00:24:30,531 --> 00:24:35,531
We've seen that people will write 
something racist or sexist or whatever 

526
00:24:35,531 --> 00:24:39,310
and we'll see them get fired from their 
job because of something that they put 

527
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:39,310
on facebook.

528
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:42,010
Because your profile represents the 
actual you.

529
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,370
It's not anonymous.
Yes.

530
00:24:43,371 --> 00:24:45,230
I feel like there's benefit to that.
Yeah,

531
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:45,920
that's right.
There's some.

532
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,840
I mean the problem is that can also be 
outraged.

533
00:24:47,841 --> 00:24:52,841
Bob's where someone will post something 
and it's taken out of context and made 

534
00:24:52,841 --> 00:24:53,630
me realize what they've entered as a 
joke.

535
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,810
Like the woman who went to,
took that trip to Africa Qa,

536
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:03,050
kind of a self effacing comment about 
racism and people thought it was racist,

537
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,820
but she was actually making fun of 
races.

538
00:25:04,821 --> 00:25:08,180
I think she was drunk and she was being 
racist.

539
00:25:08,181 --> 00:25:10,520
I just thought she was being funny 
because Kummete look,

540
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:14,720
I'm a comic and I have a lot of comedian
friends that are not racist,

541
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:17,480
but they will say hilarious racist 
things.

542
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,710
Right.
Because it's funny.

543
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,670
It's not because they're racist,
but.

544
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,210
What was her name?
Justine Sacco.

545
00:25:23,211 --> 00:25:24,300
Thank you.
This was the uh,

546
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:29,030
I hope I don't get aids,
but a lol.

547
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,840
That's what she wrote.
She woke up 12 hours later after a Xanex

548
00:25:32,841 --> 00:25:34,190
and wine hangover,
I'm sure.

549
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,470
And her life was a living hell.
Yeah.

550
00:25:36,471 --> 00:25:38,480
I mean,
and she still to this day is,

551
00:25:38,481 --> 00:25:43,000
I mean Jamie knows her name is not 
racist.

552
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:48,340
It ironically she meant it.
She herself was not racist and she 

553
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:52,661
become controversial after that as well.
She was like the PR person for 

554
00:25:52,661 --> 00:25:56,111
draftkings or fanduel or stuff when they
were going through some issues a couple 

555
00:25:56,111 --> 00:25:58,040
of years ago.
Draft kings is an online gambling thing.

556
00:25:58,041 --> 00:26:00,860
It's kind of controversial.
Gambling on sports and stuff like that.

557
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,300
Yeah.
I just,

558
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:07,390
we look for people to also,
we were talking about this before 

559
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,420
without getting into details about who 
we're talking about,

560
00:26:08,421 --> 00:26:13,421
but there are certain people that are 
very flawed individuals that looked to 

561
00:26:13,421 --> 00:26:18,251
find people and attack them to take away
some of the spotlight on their own 

562
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:20,510
flaws.
Absolutely.

563
00:26:20,511 --> 00:26:23,990
This is a thing.
This is a big part of virtue signaling,

564
00:26:23,991 --> 00:26:25,490
right?
Like a big part of,

565
00:26:25,491 --> 00:26:28,100
uh,
going after people and outrage mobs,

566
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:30,500
as long as the mob is attacking someone 
else,

567
00:26:30,501 --> 00:26:32,540
they're not attacking you.
That's right.

568
00:26:32,541 --> 00:26:33,380
Yeah,
that's right.

569
00:26:33,381 --> 00:26:34,460
And there is,
I mean,

570
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:38,600
it is a interesting question over a 
history is how do,

571
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:43,900
how do some of these things called 
extraordinarily extraordinary popular 

572
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:44,280
delusions and the madness

573
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:49,280
of crowds to Tulip Bulb Mania in Holland
in the 17th century.

574
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,030
It's that,
oh,

575
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:52,830
there's a,
this,

576
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:57,840
this kind of bubble where people started
to outbid each other on tulip bulbs and 

577
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,210
the,
you know,

578
00:26:59,211 --> 00:27:04,211
the price of a single tulip bulb went 
like through the roof and then it's 

579
00:27:04,211 --> 00:27:07,291
suddenly crashed.
People lost fortunes because everyone 

580
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:07,410
was expecting everyone else to keep 
bidding up the price,

581
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:09,510
but there,
oh yeah,

582
00:27:09,511 --> 00:27:11,460
the tulip bulbs,
Tulip Bulb mania,

583
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:16,880
nutty,
but then they're also witch hunts where 

584
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,150
when a woman would be accused of sinking
a ship or causing a crop failure or 

585
00:27:21,121 --> 00:27:25,140
making someone's child gets sick,
they're the pogroms in Europe where Jews

586
00:27:25,141 --> 00:27:30,141
were accused of poisoning the wells are 
killing Christian voice to make 

587
00:27:30,141 --> 00:27:31,560
Mozzarella their blood.
Where the lynchings in the,

588
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:36,600
uh,
American south where African Americans 

589
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,471
were accused of raping a woman and I are
based on just a rumor spreading and 

590
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:42,300
they'd be tortured and hanged.

591
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,760
There's the McCarthy era.
There were,

592
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,580
uh,
there's the,

593
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:47,070
the,
the daycare,

594
00:27:47,071 --> 00:27:52,071
satanic ritual abuse.
Amenia of the 19 eighties were these 

595
00:27:52,071 --> 00:27:56,960
daycare workers were accused basically 
by coaching kids to embellish these 

596
00:27:58,171 --> 00:28:03,171
fantastic stories of how they were 
sexually molested and tortured and 

597
00:28:03,171 --> 00:28:06,090
forced to take part in satanic rituals 
mean all totally nonsense.

598
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:11,270
And people went to jail.
So initially the question is how do 

599
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:14,781
people kind of lose their collective 
minds in every once in awhile in 

600
00:28:14,781 --> 00:28:18,150
history?
And a part of the answer is if you start

601
00:28:18,151 --> 00:28:23,151
a,
a kind of vicious circle of denouncing 

602
00:28:23,151 --> 00:28:26,271
people and then denouncing people who 
don't denounce people denouncing people 

603
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:29,400
who call the whistle on a and other 
people denouncing people,

604
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:33,440
then you can get a kind of circle of 
terror where no one wants.

605
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:38,480
Everyone is so afraid of being denounced
that they wanted to announce first 

606
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,670
Stalinist Soviet Union as another 
example at Mao's,

607
00:28:41,671 --> 00:28:42,180
China.

608
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:45,510
And that's somehow some,
one of the ways in which dictators could

609
00:28:45,511 --> 00:28:46,470
often,
uh,

610
00:28:46,471 --> 00:28:49,560
enforce their power by turning the 
citizens against each other.

611
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:54,680
So everyone's denouncing everyone else 
out of fear that they'll be announced 

612
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,410
first that's going on right now in North
Korea,

613
00:28:55,411 --> 00:28:56,520
right?
Absolutely.

614
00:28:56,521 --> 00:28:56,970
Yeah.
Yeah.

615
00:28:56,971 --> 00:29:01,971
North Korea,
they have this thing where they each 

616
00:29:01,971 --> 00:29:02,370
have to report on each other.
Like when people are together,

617
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:07,520
they report on each other for different 
things that they did that were 

618
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:07,840
violations of whatever code that they 
follow.

619
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:12,980
Absolutely.
And so governments know how to explain 

620
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:15,381
it,
but it isn't just governments that can 

621
00:29:15,381 --> 00:29:15,381
happen spontaneously too.
It's a weird human trait,

622
00:29:15,381 --> 00:29:15,690
isn't it?
It is.

623
00:29:15,691 --> 00:29:20,691
It's a combination of a kind of a human 
trait and a kind of dynamic when you 

624
00:29:20,691 --> 00:29:21,750
have a kind of a network of people,
uh,

625
00:29:21,751 --> 00:29:26,751
and,
and they all are kind of trapped and no 

626
00:29:26,751 --> 00:29:29,691
one can be the first person to escape 
from this vicious circle because they 

627
00:29:29,691 --> 00:29:31,130
don't want to be the one who is 
denounced it,

628
00:29:31,131 --> 00:29:35,190
imprisoned and tortured or whatever.
The consequences may be a,

629
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,620
what do you think?
Where do you think,

630
00:29:37,621 --> 00:29:40,320
if you think at all about this,
where do you think this is all headed?

631
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,010
Like it,
especially

632
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:43,480
in terms of social media and.

633
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:45,420
Yes,
it's hard to tell,

634
00:29:45,421 --> 00:29:46,340
but I,
you,

635
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:51,390
you mentioned the possibility that 
there's been such a growing recognition 

636
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:55,041
of the problem that we will mount a 
response that it'll just seem ridiculous

637
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:59,700
of the outrage mob once it's recognized 
that there are outraged mobs and virtual

638
00:29:59,701 --> 00:30:03,390
signaling fanatics.
Once we have a label for them.

639
00:30:03,391 --> 00:30:05,450
Once we know that it's a thing,
a,

640
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:09,150
it'll seem so ridiculous that people 
will be less tempted to do it.

641
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,430
I mean,
that's the optimistic of a outcome.

642
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:14,630
Well,
there's just such a flaw in there.

643
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,240
There's a real issue in writing things 
and one of the issues,

644
00:30:18,241 --> 00:30:23,241
especially if you're writing about a 
subject where there's a lot of people 

645
00:30:23,241 --> 00:30:25,110
involved or perhaps an even an 
individual,

646
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:27,330
is that you're the only one that's 
writing.

647
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:30,600
Like if you were having a conversation 
with that person,

648
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,580
they would be able to say something 
back.

649
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,170
You'd be able to say something and they 
will go,

650
00:30:34,171 --> 00:30:35,820
well that's not exactly how I was 
thinking.

651
00:30:35,821 --> 00:30:40,821
Actually.
I was looking at it this way and the 

652
00:30:40,821 --> 00:30:40,821
other person would go,
oh,

653
00:30:40,821 --> 00:30:42,180
okay,
so your take on it was,

654
00:30:42,181 --> 00:30:47,181
you know,
and they would go back and forth and 

655
00:30:47,181 --> 00:30:49,271
exchange information.
Hopefully come to some sort of an 

656
00:30:49,271 --> 00:30:49,271
understanding of what's going on in each
person's mind.

657
00:30:49,271 --> 00:30:54,110
Absolutely.
Whereas you can define someone in a 

658
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:56,691
tweet or a facebook post or a blog post.
You can define someone without them 

659
00:30:57,961 --> 00:31:00,300
having any ability to respond in the 
moment.

660
00:31:00,301 --> 00:31:05,301
So you have this whole uninterrupted 
chunk where you could talk about,

661
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,270
you know,
fill in the blank,

662
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:11,300
some celebrity or some politician or 
whatever and you can define them and 

663
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:15,741
some really horrible,
nasty way and they just have to sit 

664
00:31:15,741 --> 00:31:17,220
there and read it.
Like it is just your thoughts.

665
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:22,730
But that's not an accurate method of 
communicating ideas with a person.

666
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:27,960
It's just your one uninterrupted take on
things.

667
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,230
Absolutely.
So I,

668
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,630
my,
my second to last book,

669
00:31:30,631 --> 00:31:33,600
the one just before my current book 
enlightenment now,

670
00:31:33,601 --> 00:31:35,430
but the previous book was called the 
sense of style.

671
00:31:35,431 --> 00:31:37,950
It was a writing manual way began.
Began.

672
00:31:37,951 --> 00:31:38,910
It is.
I said,

673
00:31:38,911 --> 00:31:43,911
why is so much writing so bad?
How come there's so much writing where 

674
00:31:43,911 --> 00:31:45,210
you just can't understand what the 
person is talking about.

675
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,600
And I mentioned some theories.
Some people think that it's academics 

676
00:31:50,911 --> 00:31:54,360
and intellectuals trying to show off how
profound they are.

677
00:31:54,361 --> 00:31:58,050
My how incomprehensible they are.
Like if people could understand it,

678
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:00,140
it can't be that complicated.
So I ended up right.

679
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,860
The stuff that no one will understand 
that nothing.

680
00:32:01,861 --> 00:32:04,080
I'm really smart.
So that's one theory and you know,

681
00:32:04,081 --> 00:32:08,330
there might be some truth to it,
but I think that the main theory is that

682
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:10,710
that writing is,
as you just as you described it,

683
00:32:10,711 --> 00:32:12,510
it's a one way channel of communication.

684
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:13,910
It's very unnatural.
You know,

685
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:16,470
when we speak,
you and I were having a conversation,

686
00:32:16,471 --> 00:32:21,471
we're looking at each other in the eye 
and our eyebrows go up and they get 

687
00:32:21,471 --> 00:32:23,520
needed and if I say,
if I start to become too obscure,

688
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:24,860
you're going to give me a quizzical 
look.

689
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:30,720
Terrified expression on their face where
you can interact and say,

690
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,100
well,
what the hell was that?

691
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,350
When you're writing,
you have none of that.

692
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:38,390
And so I think part of the skill in 
writing what I least,

693
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:43,400
what I argue in the of style is to 
become a kind of enough of an intuitive 

694
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:47,711
psychologists that you can try to 
anticipate what your reader knows and 

695
00:32:47,711 --> 00:32:51,201
what your reader doesn't know and that 
because you have no way of determining 

696
00:32:51,201 --> 00:32:55,421
that as you're writing because you're 
just sitting there tapping away whoever 

697
00:32:55,421 --> 00:32:56,120
was going to read what you write there.

698
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,840
You never get to meet them.
It might be,

699
00:32:57,841 --> 00:33:02,841
you know,
three years from now they might be 

700
00:33:02,841 --> 00:33:02,841
halfway across the world and it's just 
one way and so,

701
00:33:02,841 --> 00:33:06,620
and there's another kind of 
psychological problem that we all have.

702
00:33:06,621 --> 00:33:10,670
It's just part of being human called the
curse of knowledge.

703
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,670
Namely when you know something,
it's really,

704
00:33:13,671 --> 00:33:16,100
really hard to imagine what it's like 
not to know it.

705
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,720
You just assume that everyone knows it,
the,

706
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:18,410
your,
your,

707
00:33:18,411 --> 00:33:22,310
your understanding is everyone's 
understanding and so you right away,

708
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:23,120
you know,
write.

709
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:23,420
Right,
right,

710
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:23,970
right,
right.

711
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:29,680
And it never occurs to you that the 
reader doesn't know your abbreviations 

712
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,810
or your jargon or can't visualize what 
you're describing.

713
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:37,990
It's so clear to you,
the writer and a lot of bad writing 

714
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:41,741
comes from the curse of knowledge that 
is a writer not getting into the heads 

715
00:33:41,741 --> 00:33:45,970
of his reader and a lot of the cure is 
either to at least at least know that 

716
00:33:47,271 --> 00:33:52,271
it's a problem and think of what can I 
read it would be reasonably expected to 

717
00:33:52,271 --> 00:33:53,120
know because we're not even that good at
that.

718
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,500
I mean,
none of us remind readers,

719
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:59,770
just showing someone a draft of what 
you've written and you're often 

720
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:01,550
surprised at how often they'll say,
I don't know what you're talking about.

721
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:04,280
Maybe that's what we should force people
to do at twitter.

722
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:09,430
Maybe we should have like a team of 
people that you send your tweet to a 

723
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,660
circle of confidence.
Well,

724
00:34:12,661 --> 00:34:13,010
that,
I mean,

725
00:34:13,011 --> 00:34:14,300
that's the way it works in publishing.
You know,

726
00:34:14,301 --> 00:34:16,400
you got,
you have an editor in academia,

727
00:34:16,401 --> 00:34:18,320
you got peer review before it's 
published.

728
00:34:18,321 --> 00:34:20,440
They send it out to other people just 
like you and they,

729
00:34:20,441 --> 00:34:25,441
they,
they write a little review and you've 

730
00:34:25,441 --> 00:34:25,441
got to modify it if it doesn't make any 
sense.

731
00:34:25,441 --> 00:34:26,720
Right?
So Justine Sacco had sent that to a team

732
00:34:26,721 --> 00:34:28,380
of confidence they would went.
No,

733
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,790
don't write that.
I'm sorry,

734
00:34:31,791 --> 00:34:33,050
I'm on a plane.
I'm drunk.

735
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:34,700
I'll call you from Africa.

736
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:35,840
Well,
this is,

737
00:34:35,841 --> 00:34:40,841
you know,
what are the big themes in my new book 

738
00:34:40,841 --> 00:34:41,250
enlightenment now is,
um,

739
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:46,510
how is it that we're simultaneously in 
many ways getting smarter but also seem 

740
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:51,260
to be getting stupider society.
So I think part of it is that none of us

741
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,610
is individually are that smart.
Uh,

742
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:59,650
we all and,
and cognitive psychologists have shown 

743
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:01,130
that humans have all kinds of biases and
fallacies.

744
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,480
We,
um,

745
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,970
we,
we rezoned from stereotypes.

746
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:09,320
We assess risk by how easy it is to 
imagine something.

747
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:10,640
Uh,
so,

748
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:15,670
you know,
we're afraid of getting on a plane 

749
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:15,770
because it's very easy to imagine a 
plane crashing and plane crashes,

750
00:35:15,771 --> 00:35:20,771
make the news.
We don't worry about texting while 

751
00:35:20,771 --> 00:35:23,291
driving because there's never a headline
on page one of the hundred people who 

752
00:35:23,291 --> 00:35:27,551
died in the past week because they 
texted while driving a certainly a lot 

753
00:35:27,551 --> 00:35:27,980
of fallacies.
So,

754
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:28,820
but the thing is,
we,

755
00:35:28,821 --> 00:35:30,530
as a species,
they've done some amazing things.

756
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:31,910
I mean,
we discovered those Mayan,

757
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,210
a buried city.
So,

758
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:38,310
you know,
science is amazing and because 

759
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:40,540
democracies are amazing and it's because
none of us solves a problem all by 

760
00:35:40,921 --> 00:35:45,921
ourselves.
We're part of our kind of collective 

761
00:35:45,921 --> 00:35:48,051
brain that works by rules where all of 
the excesses of one person get kind of 

762
00:35:48,661 --> 00:35:50,190
balanced out by,
uh,

763
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,620
by other people.
And that's why you have a,

764
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:57,860
you know,
things like a checks and balances in a 

765
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:00,000
democracy where instead of having a 
supreme leader who just runs the country

766
00:36:00,001 --> 00:36:05,001
the way he wants,
he's got a worry about the legislature 

767
00:36:05,001 --> 00:36:06,000
and the courts and the judges and you 
know,

768
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:08,850
and in an impeachment and so on,
in science,

769
00:36:08,851 --> 00:36:13,851
instead of having one genius announcing 
the way the world works,

770
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:18,970
you know,
he or she has to subject themselves to 

771
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:19,860
peer review and get,
let other sciences criticize.

772
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,990
Scientists,
criticize him or her.

773
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,120
And,
uh,

774
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:26,700
whenever you get people acting 
intelligently,

775
00:36:26,701 --> 00:36:31,701
it's often because they belong to these 
institutions with rules that are 

776
00:36:31,701 --> 00:36:35,040
designed to make up for the idiocies of 
any individual person.

777
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:35,670
Hmm.

778
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:37,700
That's fascinating.
Um,

779
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,420
I,
I completely agree with that.

780
00:36:39,421 --> 00:36:42,460
That makes so much sense.
I've also felt that there,

781
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:47,360
there's not a lot,
there's not,

782
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:52,610
we have difficulties.
Obviously people have difficulties in 

783
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:52,610
this life,
their social difficulties,

784
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:53,180
economic difficulties,
but when,

785
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,380
in terms of survival difficulties,
it's,

786
00:36:55,740 --> 00:37:00,740
it's way easier to get by today than it 
has ever been in human history.

787
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:06,560
And I wonder if human beings have a need
for adversity and complexity and problem

788
00:37:09,001 --> 00:37:14,001
solving and all these things that are 
less.

789
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,130
They're less present today than ever 
before.

790
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:19,980
I think things are just almost too 
simple.

791
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:24,090
We've made it to ease.
We've nerf the world and in doing so,

792
00:37:24,091 --> 00:37:29,091
it's easier to just kind of be double 
minded and drift through and follow the 

793
00:37:29,091 --> 00:37:33,681
herd.
The herd is so big and there's so many 

794
00:37:33,681 --> 00:37:36,411
people in the herd.
If you just do what most people are 

795
00:37:36,411 --> 00:37:40,461
doing,
where what most of the people are 

796
00:37:40,461 --> 00:37:40,461
wearing,
say the things.

797
00:37:40,461 --> 00:37:44,060
Most of the people say you'll survive 
and you'll survive and you'll find some 

798
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:46,230
other dimwitted person to breed with and
you'll make dimwitted children.

799
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,380
And I'm being dead serious.
I think there's a certain,

800
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:53,010
when you're dealing with this massive 
pack of humans,

801
00:37:53,011 --> 00:37:56,520
300 plus million on a continent,
there's just.

802
00:37:56,610 --> 00:38:01,610
There's so much.
I've always said like if you have a 

803
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:05,121
group of people,
if you're being very generous and you 

804
00:38:05,121 --> 00:38:07,611
have 100 people in a room,
what are the odds that one of those 

805
00:38:07,611 --> 00:38:07,611
people is a moron?
It's a hundred percent.

806
00:38:07,611 --> 00:38:12,381
That one is going to be a moron.
That leaves you with $3 million morons 

807
00:38:12,381 --> 00:38:16,311
in the United States of America if 
you're being really kind and 3 million 

808
00:38:16,311 --> 00:38:16,311
geniuses.
Yes.

809
00:38:16,311 --> 00:38:16,320
Yeah.
Well,

810
00:38:16,321 --> 00:38:19,950
probably I.
I'm an optimist.

811
00:38:19,951 --> 00:38:22,380
I would like to thank you.
Dealing with probably 6 million genius.

812
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:23,910
Okay.
Well,

813
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:30,530
my book is often described as a book on 
optimism enlightenment now because I 

814
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:35,141
have 75 graphs,
almost all of it showed the world 

815
00:38:35,141 --> 00:38:38,531
getting better,
including what some people think of the 

816
00:38:38,531 --> 00:38:40,501
most incredible.
A graph in the book on a phenomenon 

817
00:38:40,501 --> 00:38:41,830
called the flynn effect,
which is that,

818
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,930
believe it or not,
and I know most people do not.

819
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,710
Iq scores have been rising for most of 
the last hundred years,

820
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:50,620
but three points a decade.
Now this I know,

821
00:38:50,621 --> 00:38:53,080
it seems totally unbelievable,
but yeah,

822
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:58,081
they discovered it with Flynn.
A philosopher discovered it when he 

823
00:38:58,081 --> 00:39:01,231
realized that the people who make Iq 
tests had to keep re norming the tests 

824
00:39:01,231 --> 00:39:04,870
to keep a 100 as the average because the
average kept creeping up and it was like

825
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:08,080
110 where we keep that.
That's what most people score.

826
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:13,290
We say that the average is 100.
We got to adjust the scale downward and 

827
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:13,290
flint realized,
Hey,

828
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:17,611
wait a second,
they keep doing this over and over 

829
00:39:17,611 --> 00:39:17,611
again.

830
00:39:17,611 --> 00:39:17,611
That must mean the population's getting 
smarter now,

831
00:39:17,611 --> 00:39:22,220
not biologically smarter.
It's not that people's brainpower has 

832
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:26,611
somehow magically been increasing,
although probably a little bit of that 

833
00:39:26,611 --> 00:39:28,780
through better nutrition,
better sanitation and health care and so

834
00:39:28,781 --> 00:39:30,250
on.
But a lot of it is just that,

835
00:39:30,251 --> 00:39:35,251
a lot that ideas that used to be kind of
sophisticated and restricted to 

836
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:41,790
professors and scientists and 
statisticians kind of trickle down to 

837
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:43,240
the population.
And so we things like,

838
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:48,980
um,
a placebo effect or trade off or cost 

839
00:39:49,511 --> 00:39:53,980
benefit analysis or win win situation,
all these things that actually came from

840
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:59,220
pretty fancy schmancy theory originally,
but they kind of are loose stone the 

841
00:39:59,471 --> 00:40:02,320
whole population and they become part of
everyone's conventional wisdom.

842
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:07,680
Also.
We have to think more and more in 

843
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,730
abstract ways just to deal with things 
like a subway map or a smartphone.

844
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:12,520
Uh,
watching TV is,

845
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:15,190
it used to be,
you turn on your TV would be on,

846
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,900
now you got to kind of program that 
bloody thing.

847
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:22,350
So the demands of life have become more 
sophisticated and ideas spread more 

848
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:27,760
quickly and so we are quite literally 
getting smarter up to a point,

849
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:29,890
things that can't go on forever,
don't.

850
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:32,350
And the flynn effect is starting to 
level off,

851
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:34,210
but there has been this,
this,

852
00:40:34,211 --> 00:40:36,580
uh,
this drift upward in intelligence.

853
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:41,970
I don't think that's surprising at all.
I think if you look at the amount of 

854
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:44,770
information that people are subject to 
today and just the sheer raw data,

855
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:48,970
I mean there's a lot of the data is just
nonsense and twitter and that.

856
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:53,560
What is the quote that we produce?
More content in two days.

857
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:57,790
The entire human history every two days.
Something crazy like that.

858
00:40:57,791 --> 00:40:59,260
Is that right?
It sounds,

859
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,980
it sounds plausible,
but most of it is like,

860
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:03,970
lol,
I just went to the mall,

861
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,420
you know,
this is a lot of nonsense in there.

862
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:10,540
But the sheer amount of interesting 
information,

863
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:15,570
like those newly discovered Mayan Ruins 
in Guatemala and things along those 

864
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:15,670
lines,
or you know,

865
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:16,760
some,
uh,

866
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:21,780
there was some interesting new 
information on the history of human 

867
00:41:23,351 --> 00:41:28,351
beings because they found some new teeth
and some throwback the date of modern 

868
00:41:28,571 --> 00:41:33,571
humans and they keep moving that back,
which the point is we're constantly 

869
00:41:33,571 --> 00:41:36,050
getting more information and more data,
more things to think about.

870
00:41:36,051 --> 00:41:41,051
And I've just got to assume that the 
amount of information that comes to a 

871
00:41:41,051 --> 00:41:44,741
person in 2018 is just vastly larger 
than the amount that came to them in 

872
00:41:44,931 --> 00:41:45,770
1978.

873
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:47,450
Oh,
absolutely.

874
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:51,950
And there are as idiotic as a lot of 
public debate is today.

875
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:54,050
There's a lot of idiocy in the past.
Sure.

876
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:54,770
I mean,
in the,

877
00:41:54,771 --> 00:41:55,460
uh,
you know,

878
00:41:55,461 --> 00:42:00,461
as recently as the 19 sixties is that,
that movie on the first interracial 

879
00:42:00,461 --> 00:42:02,870
couple in Virginia where there was a 
court,

880
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:08,120
a judge who said God didn't mean for the
racist intermarry that's why he put 

881
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:13,130
black people in Africa and yellow people
in Asia and white people in Europe.

882
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:14,780
So the judge,
the judge,

883
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:19,810
hilarious.
The judge said this in his decision 

884
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:19,810
eventually overturned loving versus 
Virginia.

885
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,160
I'm now,
I mean,

886
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:24,260
no one would make that stupid an 
argument today,

887
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:27,860
even even people that we think of as,
as kind of racist,

888
00:42:27,861 --> 00:42:30,440
they'd be embarrassed and you're just 
too stupid and people on the,

889
00:42:30,441 --> 00:42:32,690
on the left made some pretty stupid 
arguments as well.

890
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:37,920
Uh,
when Castro sent all of the gay people 

891
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,621
to concentration camps in Cuba,
you had Susan Sontag respected leftwing 

892
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,220
intellectual who's saying,
well,

893
00:42:43,221 --> 00:42:43,910
this is,
you know,

894
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,920
you got to forgive them because a Latin 
America was such a sexualized culture 

895
00:42:49,251 --> 00:42:50,600
and they were prostitutes.

896
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:53,600
It was decadence that of course it was a
little bit of an overreaction.

897
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,550
Now today,
I don't think anyone on the,

898
00:42:55,551 --> 00:42:58,760
on the left or the right would say it's 
okay to send gay people to concentration

899
00:42:58,761 --> 00:43:01,580
camps because they were a lot of 
prostitutes in Havana.

900
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:06,850
But that's the kind of idiotic statement
that we kind of forget that people used 

901
00:43:07,071 --> 00:43:10,220
to make in the past too.
So it's way reassuring ourselves.

902
00:43:10,221 --> 00:43:15,110
Whenever we see a debate getting a 
seemingly getting stupider and stupider.

903
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,630
You got to remember there's a lot of 
stupidity in the past too.

904
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:19,910
Oh yeah,
a massive amount.

905
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,220
And I think,
I think you're right that the,

906
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:24,170
you know,
it's hard to tell day by day,

907
00:43:24,171 --> 00:43:29,171
especially when your attention is 
concentrated by the worst things that 

908
00:43:29,171 --> 00:43:29,300
happen.
And again,

909
00:43:29,301 --> 00:43:30,410
this a big theme of,
of,

910
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:35,440
of uh,
enlightenment now that your picture of 

911
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:35,440
the world when it's.

912
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,730
Because the human mind really is driven 
by anecdotes and images and stories and 

913
00:43:39,801 --> 00:43:42,710
that's what the news gives us.
But if you look at trends,

914
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:47,860
uh,
he follow the trend lines and not the 

915
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:49,991
headlines.
You see that a lot of things really are 

916
00:43:49,991 --> 00:43:49,991
getting better,
uh,

917
00:43:49,991 --> 00:43:51,650
gradually.
But that accumulates over time.

918
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:54,800
And one of the things with the flow of 
information,

919
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,790
we are actually getting more.
We meaning Americans,

920
00:43:58,791 --> 00:44:03,791
but also worldwide.
There is this trend of getting more 

921
00:44:03,791 --> 00:44:03,791
liberal,
more tolerant,

922
00:44:03,791 --> 00:44:05,060
more progressive,
you know,

923
00:44:05,061 --> 00:44:10,061
hard to tell day by day.
But when you think that in the 19 

924
00:44:10,061 --> 00:44:11,990
sixties there was a debate over whether 
there should be racial segregation,

925
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:17,020
whether African Americans should drink 
out a different water fountains or stay 

926
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:18,820
in different motels.
There's debate over whether women should

927
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,020
be allowed in the workplace that,
oh,

928
00:44:21,021 --> 00:44:22,550
what's going to happen to all the kids 
if they,

929
00:44:22,551 --> 00:44:23,570
uh,
uh,

930
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,130
uh,
if they're all working,

931
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:28,280
debate over whether gay people should be
allowed to be teachers.

932
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:33,730
Uh,
and we've kind of forgotten these 

933
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:33,730
because the progressive

934
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:37,250
side kind of one and the debate has 
moved on and that happens worldwide as 

935
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:39,750
Pete,
as information flows,

936
00:44:39,751 --> 00:44:43,230
as people start to meet each other as 
ideas proliferate,

937
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:48,640
uh,
there is this gradual trend toward more 

938
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:52,110
tolerance even in parts of the world 
where it seems to be totally absent.

939
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:57,130
Like in a lot of the Islamic world,
which world survey show this is the 

940
00:44:57,130 --> 00:45:01,401
least progressive part of the world in 
terms of attitudes towards women 

941
00:45:01,401 --> 00:45:02,940
attitudes towards gays,
attitudes toward child rearing.

942
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:08,150
But even the Islamic world,
there's been a drift in the liberal 

943
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:09,810
direction.
We just thought two weeks ago when Saudi

944
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:12,180
Arabia allowed women to drive.
I mean,

945
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:15,640
it's kind of modest form of progress.
Kind of Hilarious,

946
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:17,140
hilarious.
But you know,

947
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:18,090
the progress,
but it.

948
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,150
But it shows,
I mean,

949
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,290
they just could not live in this absurd 
situation forever.

950
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:27,680
The world really did drag them kicking 
and screaming out of the Middle Ages in 

951
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:27,680
this,
in this way,

952
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,640
and that kind of tends to happen over 
the long run.

953
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:30,590
Yeah.
I'm,

954
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:33,180
I'm an optimist and I,
I really do.

955
00:45:33,181 --> 00:45:34,500
Look at all these trends.
You'll,

956
00:45:34,501 --> 00:45:39,501
you'll,
you'll like the book then 75 or 75 

957
00:45:39,501 --> 00:45:39,501
optimistic graphs.
Oh,

958
00:45:39,501 --> 00:45:39,501
excellent.
I,

959
00:45:39,501 --> 00:45:44,241
yeah.
I think that if you look at just the 

960
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:44,241
overall human rights,
I mean,

961
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:48,291
one of the best indications of that is 
go and look at media representations of 

962
00:45:48,511 --> 00:45:51,660
life from the 19 fifties and sixties.
Watch movies,

963
00:45:51,661 --> 00:45:55,590
especially from the fifties,
and just see how people behave.

964
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:56,160
I mean it's,
you're,

965
00:45:56,161 --> 00:46:01,161
you're getting sort of a,
a timestamp of human interaction from 

966
00:46:01,171 --> 00:46:06,171
1950.
It's obviously an artistic 

967
00:46:06,171 --> 00:46:06,171
representation of a time.
Doesn't have that time,

968
00:46:06,171 --> 00:46:09,300
but you get a sense of how people 
thought it was okay to behave.

969
00:46:09,301 --> 00:46:11,490
There was a lot of smacking women.
Yeah,

970
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:12,610
that's right.
Yeah.

971
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:14,280
Really common in movies,
right?

972
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:17,190
And children.
You remember the scene where you know,

973
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:19,440
junior would misbehave and mom would 
say,

974
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:23,100
wait till your father gets home,
and then dad comes home and he pulls the

975
00:46:23,101 --> 00:46:25,230
belt out of his pants so he could use it
as a weapon.

976
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:30,110
So buckle would really hurt the child 
and the child would tie up a,

977
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:34,920
a pillow on his behind and it'd be stars
and go off into the corner.

978
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,150
Now you'd call social services and they 
take the child away or something.

979
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:40,200
Yeah.
Well,

980
00:46:40,201 --> 00:46:45,201
I mean I think this idea of being 
dragged kicking and screaming into this 

981
00:46:45,201 --> 00:46:47,400
new age,
I think we're all doing that and I think

982
00:46:47,401 --> 00:46:51,900
you're seeing that in so many different 
parts of our culture today.

983
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:57,260
You know,
I think that's one of the things that's 

984
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:58,581
happening with this meat too.
Movement is it all this mass public 

985
00:46:58,581 --> 00:47:01,200
shaming of sexual harassers and sexual 
assaults and all this different thing.

986
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:06,240
It's like forcing human beings to 
reassess the way they interact with each

987
00:47:06,241 --> 00:47:11,241
other and like this really radical,
very quick sort of a movement over just 

988
00:47:11,491 --> 00:47:15,330
a short period of time.
Is that a giant impact on culture?

989
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:18,120
Yeah,
and like a lot of social changes,

990
00:47:18,121 --> 00:47:19,470
it,
it happens really quickly,

991
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:22,470
probably mixes some good things and some
not so good things,

992
00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:23,240
right.
Um,

993
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:28,280
and it's really good that men no longer 
have a license to just expose themselves

994
00:47:28,441 --> 00:47:29,240
or,
or

995
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:34,740
harass a woman who,
who worked for them and treat them these

996
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:37,770
crude and ugly waste,
you know,

997
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:40,510
when there is also a legitimate concern 
that,

998
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:45,900
uh,
you just can't really believe all 

999
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:45,900
accusers.
I mean,

1000
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:46,410
we kind of learned that through history 
from,

1001
00:47:46,411 --> 00:47:46,940
from,
from,

1002
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:51,970
you know,
witch hunts and lynchings and a pogroms 

1003
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:54,300
and there's got to be proportionality.
Not all infractions are,

1004
00:47:54,301 --> 00:47:55,210
are the same,
you know,

1005
00:47:55,211 --> 00:48:00,211
the punishment should fit the crime.
So we haven't quite settled in how to 

1006
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:03,661
balance the very necessary corrective to
two men harassing women with a kind of 

1007
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:07,540
rule of law and standards of,
of justice.

1008
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:08,650
I'm

1009
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:12,160
correct me if I'm wrong about this,
but this is one of my theories is,

1010
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:13,000
uh,
we,

1011
00:48:13,001 --> 00:48:18,001
our brains,
our capacity and our understanding is 

1012
00:48:18,001 --> 00:48:19,510
relative to what's necessary at the 
time.

1013
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:23,860
And one of the things that I use is 
Dunbar's number.

1014
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:29,700
Dunbar's number is this idea that you 
could only have these intimate 

1015
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:33,451
relationships with 150 or so people or 
in terms of intimacy of understanding 

1016
00:48:33,611 --> 00:48:35,410
who they are,
knowing their name,

1017
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:40,440
knowing things about them,
but as our circle of people that we 

1018
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:45,271
interact with grows and expands.
I wonder if that's going to expand as 

1019
00:48:45,271 --> 00:48:49,201
well.
When you think about the amount of 

1020
00:48:49,201 --> 00:48:50,941
information that people can hold in 
their brain and what people are used to 

1021
00:48:50,941 --> 00:48:55,080
knowing about this is a radically 
different world in 2018 than it was in 

1022
00:48:55,631 --> 00:48:58,120
1960.
The amount of things that you were aware

1023
00:48:58,121 --> 00:49:03,121
of in 1960,
just by virtue of not having social 

1024
00:49:03,121 --> 00:49:03,121
media,
the internet,

1025
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:08,130
Google,
all the different ways that you could 

1026
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:08,950
get information from.
It's just so different.

1027
00:49:08,951 --> 00:49:11,750
I mean it's.
I don't know what,

1028
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:14,380
how many times more information you're 
getting,

1029
00:49:14,381 --> 00:49:19,381
but it must be much more much more and 
over an incredibly small period of time.

1030
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:21,810
When you think about the,
you know,

1031
00:49:21,811 --> 00:49:26,811
the relative time span that human beings
had been here a few hundred thousand 

1032
00:49:26,811 --> 00:49:29,110
years or whatever.
I wonder if this is.

1033
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:35,250
I wonder if we're changing and I wonder 
what we're going to be like if this 

1034
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:38,740
continues to grow and continues to be a 
part of our life.

1035
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:43,270
This,
if we're going to adapt our abilities,

1036
00:49:43,370 --> 00:49:48,370
well we can't.
We're not going to change the neuro,

1037
00:49:48,381 --> 00:49:50,180
biological structure of the brain,
you know,

1038
00:49:50,181 --> 00:49:54,230
very much because even though we all 
learned through our lives,

1039
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:56,660
there are limits as to what our brain 
brain can do.

1040
00:49:56,930 --> 00:50:01,930
But what I think happens is there's a 
back and forth between our brains and 

1041
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:06,461
the technology.
So the technology adjusts to take into 

1042
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:06,830
account how the,
how our brains work.

1043
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:07,950
So the,
the,

1044
00:50:07,970 --> 00:50:11,750
the restriction of can't know or feel 
that,

1045
00:50:11,751 --> 00:50:12,560
you know,
more than 100,

1046
00:50:12,561 --> 00:50:17,561
150 people in kind of helps define the 
set of top,

1047
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:22,010
top,
rank friends in a social network.

1048
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,320
Uh,
the fact that we're visual creatures,

1049
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:24,680
you know,
we're,

1050
00:50:24,681 --> 00:50:25,700
we're,
we're primates.

1051
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:28,340
We get a lot of our,
to our eyeballs.

1052
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:33,200
It's one of the reasons why computer 
technology has changed so much since the

1053
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:38,200
eighties and seventies.
Like when I first learned to program a 

1054
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,811
computer,
it was just all text and a or use a 

1055
00:50:40,811 --> 00:50:40,811
computer.

1056
00:50:40,811 --> 00:50:44,310
I mean they're just 80 characters and 
aligned and you had the letters of the 

1057
00:50:44,310 --> 00:50:48,341
alphabet and that's all there was and it
soon became clear that a,

1058
00:50:49,031 --> 00:50:51,950
that's not a very efficient way of 
getting ideas into a brain.

1059
00:50:51,951 --> 00:50:56,450
It's really laborious and tiring and so 
you have graphic user user interfaces.

1060
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:59,660
I mean the apple was the first to 
commercialize it,

1061
00:50:59,661 --> 00:51:01,910
but it had been developed beforehand at 
Xerox,

1062
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:07,120
but it's really exotic at first when you
saw a screen with these windows and 

1063
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:09,860
pointers and icons and a mouse and 
computers don't work that way.

1064
00:51:09,861 --> 00:51:12,530
Naturally you took a huge amount.
Still does.

1065
00:51:12,531 --> 00:51:16,070
Takes a huge amount of programming to 
get a computer to pretend that there's a

1066
00:51:16,071 --> 00:51:21,071
sheet of paper up on the screen,
but that because we're visual creatures,

1067
00:51:21,831 --> 00:51:25,880
the technology adapted so that we could 
feel comfortable using it.

1068
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:31,240
So some of it is how much do we adjust 
to the technology and how much is the 

1069
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,240
technology forced to adjust to us.

1070
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:37,930
I'm thinking in terms of the actual 
capability of the human mind and when 

1071
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:43,780
you read about the modern human brains,
like there was an article that was 

1072
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:46,850
published recently that was trying to 
read a map,

1073
00:51:46,851 --> 00:51:51,851
the timeline of the modern human brain 
and I think they were pointing to about 

1074
00:51:51,851 --> 00:51:56,621
35,000
years ago now and see if we can find 

1075
00:51:56,621 --> 00:52:00,671
that.
Trying to figure out what exactly they 

1076
00:52:00,671 --> 00:52:03,071
were saying,
but essentially they were saying that 

1077
00:52:03,071 --> 00:52:04,721
the human,
the modern human brain was far more 

1078
00:52:04,721 --> 00:52:05,550
recent or interest.
Again,

1079
00:52:05,570 --> 00:52:07,360
I'm not surprised.
Yeah.

1080
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:09,500
Well I would have guessed a little bit 
older than that,

1081
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:11,960
but yeah,
in the tens of thousands of years.

1082
00:52:11,961 --> 00:52:12,220
Yeah.

1083
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,790
So with the.
One of the big mysteries,

1084
00:52:14,791 --> 00:52:18,300
right is the doubling of the human brain
size over a period of what it was like 2

1085
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:23,300
million years.
This something had happened to cause 

1086
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:26,931
that some change in our environment,
some changing our behavior and our what 

1087
00:52:26,931 --> 00:52:27,990
has been a bigger change in the 
internet.

1088
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:33,020
Like what has been a bigger change and 
the access to information that people 

1089
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:35,961
have today.
And I'm wondering if like we're not 

1090
00:52:35,961 --> 00:52:38,691
experiencing,
when you're talking about these rises 

1091
00:52:38,691 --> 00:52:38,691
steady rise of Iq,
obviously it's not just the internet,

1092
00:52:38,691 --> 00:52:43,660
it's education,
the cumulative data that people just 

1093
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,090
keep piling onto and more people learn 
more things and people get wiser and you

1094
00:52:45,091 --> 00:52:45,400
know,
our,

1095
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:49,800
the way we interface with information is
better than it's ever been before.

1096
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:53,760
But I wonder about the capacity and the 
capabilities of the human mind.

1097
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:57,750
If it's happening right now,
it's just a very gradual thing.

1098
00:52:57,930 --> 00:53:01,680
This 10 percent tick or 10 point tick 
per,

1099
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:04,670
per decade,
if this is going to lead you,

1100
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,720
you extrapolate,
you go 100 years from now,

1101
00:53:06,721 --> 00:53:07,760
200 years from now,
we.

1102
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:09,030
What are we going to be looking at?

1103
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:13,270
The thing is that what happened over the
last few tens of thousands of years,

1104
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:18,550
it is not going to be replicated anytime
soon because that was driven by 

1105
00:53:18,550 --> 00:53:21,580
Darwinian natural selection,
which just meant that smarter people had

1106
00:53:21,581 --> 00:53:26,581
more surviving babies.
That's a process that as a speed limit 

1107
00:53:26,581 --> 00:53:28,020
measured in generations,
uh,

1108
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:29,640
and it's,
uh,

1109
00:53:29,850 --> 00:53:34,140
it may not be that coping in a modern 
society makes you have more babies.

1110
00:53:34,141 --> 00:53:36,470
And maybe the other way round,
you know,

1111
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,280
as you're more educated,
you have fewer children.

1112
00:53:38,570 --> 00:53:41,370
Um,
and so I think a lot of the,

1113
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:46,550
uh,
there's going to be a certain amount of 

1114
00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:47,100
plasticity of what you can master in 
your own lifetime,

1115
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:52,040
especially if you start in childhood a,
you're going to,

1116
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:54,540
a lot of these skills become second 
nature.

1117
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:56,130
How to look things up,
how to,

1118
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:58,920
uh,
how to use these devices efficiently.

1119
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:01,670
And then that will,
can,

1120
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:03,930
can reach limits that only so many hours
in the day.

1121
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:05,850
And there was only so many neurons in 
your brain.

1122
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:11,270
But in conjunction with that,
the technology becomes more human 

1123
00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:15,351
friendly.
And there are new ways of getting 

1124
00:54:15,351 --> 00:54:15,351
information into the brain.
You know,

1125
00:54:15,351 --> 00:54:18,480
as I mentioned,
we've gone from just lines of characters

1126
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:21,480
to graphic user interfaces and video 
and,

1127
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:26,780
and more like creative data graphics 
where you see moving colored graphs as a

1128
00:54:27,241 --> 00:54:30,360
way of getting a bunch of variables into
a human head more efficiently.

1129
00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:35,690
And virtual reality might be the next 
step where we bought three d 

1130
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:37,020
environments that we can explore.
Uh,

1131
00:54:37,021 --> 00:54:41,730
and that may be a way of,
of getting our puny brains to experience

1132
00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:43,470
more information.

1133
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,170
Yeah.
I was going to bring that up to you next

1134
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:50,190
[inaudible].
That's one of the things that concerns 

1135
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:50,930
me the most is how good virtual reality 
is now,

1136
00:54:50,931 --> 00:54:55,100
but how relatively crude it is in 
comparison to the potential.

1137
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:59,630
And have you experienced it at all?
Have you used like an htc vive or any of

1138
00:54:59,631 --> 00:55:00,000
those?
No,

1139
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:02,670
I've used more kind of lower tech kinds 
of like,

1140
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:04,740
you know,
Google cardboard and uh,

1141
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:07,460
that's Kinda interesting too.
It's still pretty interesting,

1142
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:10,940
but the vibe will freak you out.
There's one of the things,

1143
00:55:10,941 --> 00:55:12,980
and I,
I used,

1144
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,290
uh,
several years ago,

1145
00:55:15,291 --> 00:55:20,291
his version,
I think my friend Duncan trussell had 

1146
00:55:20,291 --> 00:55:20,660
one,
two or three years ago that I used and I

1147
00:55:20,661 --> 00:55:25,661
was blown away by that where you're 
underwater and there's a whale swims up 

1148
00:55:25,661 --> 00:55:29,711
to you and you know,
and it seems so real and it's get 

1149
00:55:29,711 --> 00:55:29,900
nauseous.
No,

1150
00:55:29,901 --> 00:55:30,590
I didn't,
but it was,

1151
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:31,810
it was,
I,

1152
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:33,770
it,
it's obviously fake.

1153
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:37,190
Like I'm looking at it and I can make a 
distinction quickly.

1154
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:42,340
Like when you see a movie and in the 
movie there's like fake dogs or 

1155
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:43,910
something like that or fake monsters.
You're like,

1156
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:44,870
oh,
that's a fake thing.

1157
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:50,080
It's fake,
but it's really good fake and I'm,

1158
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:51,620
I'm.
I can recognize it as a fake,

1159
00:55:51,621 --> 00:55:52,280
but I was like,
wow,

1160
00:55:52,281 --> 00:55:53,780
what is this going to be like in 10 
years?

1161
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:59,080
What is it gonna be like in 30 years 
it's going to be and how much better is 

1162
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:02,621
the interface going to be?
I'm really concerned that there's going 

1163
00:56:02,621 --> 00:56:05,120
to be a just a giant section of our 
population that completely checks out of

1164
00:56:05,121 --> 00:56:08,690
the regular world and lives in some 
strange fantasy land.

1165
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:13,840
Most of the time they just consumed food
and water and figure out a way to feed 

1166
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:17,150
themselves and spend most of their time 
locked into a helmet,

1167
00:56:17,330 --> 00:56:22,280
living in some fantastic artificial 
environment that people have created.

1168
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:24,010
Yeah.
Well,

1169
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:26,650
although just putting things into 
perspective,

1170
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:31,850
there were that,
those fears when television became 

1171
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:35,251
popular even before that with movies,
this is the question of what kind of 

1172
00:56:35,251 --> 00:56:35,890
balance people will,
will find.

1173
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:37,930
I mean,
clearly it's going to be more of exactly

1174
00:56:37,931 --> 00:56:39,310
what you describe,
but you know,

1175
00:56:39,311 --> 00:56:41,710
people do.
People do like reality to,

1176
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:42,300
uh,
you know,

1177
00:56:42,310 --> 00:56:43,660
people,
uh,

1178
00:56:43,870 --> 00:56:48,870
in huge numbers go to the national parks
and just seeing a picture book isn't the

1179
00:56:49,031 --> 00:56:51,970
same thing.
And people care whether,

1180
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,650
you know,
when they buy a work of art,

1181
00:56:53,651 --> 00:56:55,620
they care whether it's real or fake.
I,

1182
00:56:55,621 --> 00:56:58,120
so there's a lot.
There's one part of the human mind that,

1183
00:56:58,230 --> 00:57:01,690
uh,
as much as we're seduced by just sensual

1184
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:04,210
sensory experiences,
we also,

1185
00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:06,580
we have a sense of reality and we value 
it.

1186
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:08,030
And uh,
you know,

1187
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:11,380
we don't like being fooled too much.
And uh,

1188
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:16,680
uh,
the question is what balance we find 

1189
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:19,021
between the desire for authentic 
experience and the pleasure of these 

1190
00:57:19,021 --> 00:57:20,350
cheap artificial ones.

1191
00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:25,790
When you chose to write a book about 
enlightenment and you chose to write a 

1192
00:57:25,790 --> 00:57:29,001
book,
the showing all these positive graphs 

1193
00:57:29,001 --> 00:57:30,720
and all these trends that seem to be 
optimistic.

1194
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:36,890
Are you,
I'm writing that obviously you feel this

1195
00:57:36,991 --> 00:57:41,991
way and this is the data and this is 
your interpretation of where we're 

1196
00:57:41,991 --> 00:57:45,861
headed.
But are you also kind of like 

1197
00:57:45,861 --> 00:57:49,940
encouraging people in a way to have a 
more rose colored view of the world and 

1198
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:51,830
just understand that

1199
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:55,330
not so much rose colored but a bad 
description.

1200
00:57:56,390 --> 00:58:01,390
I know exactly what you mean,
but have a kind of problem solving 

1201
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:01,960
mindset,
namely,

1202
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:04,540
we have solved problems in the past,
or at least we've,

1203
00:58:04,541 --> 00:58:08,310
we've reduced them and that I think 
emboldens us to say,

1204
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:10,060
look,
the problems we have now and think,

1205
00:58:10,061 --> 00:58:15,061
well,
we can handle those two if we decide to 

1206
00:58:15,061 --> 00:58:17,470
do now what our ancestors did in the 
past that led in the right directions.

1207
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,570
And I,
I credit this to the,

1208
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:25,060
a mindset of the enlightenment,
namely that with reason and science and 

1209
00:58:25,511 --> 00:58:30,511
a concern for human welfare,
we can gradually make people better off 

1210
00:58:30,810 --> 00:58:34,280
and as long as we maintain that kind of 
philosophy of,

1211
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:35,350
of,
of living,

1212
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:37,180
uh,
then we,

1213
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:40,180
then there's a reasonable hope that we 
can solve the problems facing us.

1214
00:58:40,181 --> 00:58:41,590
It doesn't happen by itself.
There's not,

1215
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:42,880
you know,
magic escalator.

1216
00:58:42,881 --> 00:58:44,100
There's no,
you know,

1217
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:49,420
uh,
a arc of history or dialectic or any 

1218
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:50,380
mystical stuff that just makes us better
and better.

1219
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:55,800
There's a recognizing problems and 
figuring out how the world works and 

1220
00:58:56,110 --> 00:58:58,060
doing our best to solve them.
So that was,

1221
00:58:58,061 --> 00:59:03,061
that was the message and the fact that 
we have had progress contrary to the 

1222
00:59:03,061 --> 00:59:07,141
impressions you get from the headlines 
shows that this is not a crazy 

1223
00:59:07,141 --> 00:59:08,500
idealistic,
optimistic pipe dream.

1224
00:59:08,530 --> 00:59:10,660
It's happened and some more of it can 
happen.

1225
00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:15,950
Yeah.
That's where I was going with this is 

1226
00:59:15,950 --> 00:59:15,950
that why do we have this desire to 
concentrate on the negative?

1227
00:59:16,170 --> 00:59:20,460
Like I have a friend,
my friend Ian Edwards has this bit about

1228
00:59:20,461 --> 00:59:25,461
the news about renaming it to the bad 
news and he goes on this whole rant 

1229
00:59:25,461 --> 00:59:26,950
about the news.
Check this out,

1230
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:29,870
but he's right and it is a thing that 
we.

1231
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:35,170
Is it because we have this concern like 
we have to recognize danger and we want 

1232
00:59:35,351 --> 00:59:38,120
to know what's happening so that we know
that we're safe.

1233
00:59:38,121 --> 00:59:42,680
But the reality is we're dealing with a 
world of 7 billion people with 7 billion

1234
00:59:42,681 --> 00:59:44,180
stories.
You know,

1235
00:59:44,181 --> 00:59:49,181
so you're,
you're gonna be able to see negative 

1236
00:59:49,181 --> 00:59:50,060
stuff all day long if you so choose to 
do that.

1237
00:59:50,061 --> 00:59:54,230
If you so choose to concentrate on 
negativity and it gives you this bizarre

1238
00:59:54,231 --> 00:59:57,890
portrait of the world that the world is 
just this horrible place,

1239
00:59:57,891 --> 01:00:00,410
and the bill Hicks used to have a bit 
about CNN,

1240
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:03,280
about watching CNN and it'd be death 
aids,

1241
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:04,400
pit bulls.
You go outside

1242
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:06,550
Chirp and where's all this shit 
happening?

1243
01:00:06,890 --> 01:00:10,750
I think there's a lot to that.
That's good.

1244
01:00:10,790 --> 01:00:12,310
That's a great,
great examples.

1245
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:17,910
We concentrate.
What is our desire to concentrate only 

1246
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:19,210
on the negative or mostly on the 
negative?

1247
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:24,540
Well,
there is a phenomenon in psychology 

1248
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:26,401
called the negativity bias that bad is 
psychologically stronger than good.

1249
01:00:26,770 --> 01:00:31,000
So we dragged that.
We dread losses more than we enjoy gains

1250
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:35,050
and criticism hurts much more than 
praise makes you feel better.

1251
01:00:35,290 --> 01:00:36,710
Uh,
we're our,

1252
01:00:36,770 --> 01:00:37,680
uh,
our,

1253
01:00:37,690 --> 01:00:40,930
our minds are attracted to possibilities
of,

1254
01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:44,530
of death and danger and so on.
I think it's because we are really,

1255
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:46,030
as you say,
we are vulnerable.

1256
01:00:46,090 --> 01:00:48,610
There are many more things that could go
wrong then could go right.

1257
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:51,370
And that's kind of a implication of the 
law of entropy.

1258
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:56,600
A,
there's a tiny fraction of the way the 

1259
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:59,731
world could work that works,
works out well for you in an awful lot 

1260
01:00:59,731 --> 01:01:02,491
of ways that things can go wrong and so 
our minds are attuned to things that 

1261
01:01:02,491 --> 01:01:06,991
could go wrong and that kind of opens up
a market for experts to remind us of 

1262
01:01:06,991 --> 01:01:09,790
things that can go wrong,
but we may have forgotten and so the the

1263
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:13,990
news tends to gravitate to the negative 
and there are actually studies that show

1264
01:01:13,991 --> 01:01:18,991
this.
You give editors a two different 

1265
01:01:18,991 --> 01:01:22,620
framings of an event and optimistic one 
and a pessimistic when they pick the 

1266
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:23,800
pessimistic one and that's a trend 
that's actually increased.

1267
01:01:23,801 --> 01:01:28,801
I have a graph in the book,
one of the 75 graphs that shows a an 

1268
01:01:28,801 --> 01:01:31,510
automatic analysis of the tone of the 
news.

1269
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:35,200
That is how often are there positive 
words like improve better?

1270
01:01:35,410 --> 01:01:38,050
How often do their negative words like 
crisis disaster,

1271
01:01:38,051 --> 01:01:43,051
catastrophe.
The news has been getting more and more 

1272
01:01:43,051 --> 01:01:43,051
negative for about 70 years.

1273
01:01:43,051 --> 01:01:44,200
Is it uniform on both sides?
Right,

1274
01:01:44,201 --> 01:01:44,680
and left.

1275
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:47,990
A good question.
I don't know the answer.

1276
01:01:47,991 --> 01:01:49,640
I suspect it is,
but I don't know.

1277
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:52,180
I don't know the answer for sure.
There were there fluctuations,

1278
01:01:52,181 --> 01:01:54,680
there are ups and downs,
but overall the trend has been downward.

1279
01:01:54,890 --> 01:01:56,150
So partly it's all,
even though,

1280
01:01:56,151 --> 01:02:01,151
by the way,
all the other graphs in the book show 

1281
01:02:01,151 --> 01:02:01,151
that in reality the world is actually 
been getting better.

1282
01:02:01,151 --> 01:02:05,831
There are fewer deaths from war.
There's fewer homicides were making some

1283
01:02:06,201 --> 01:02:11,201
progress in a pollution.
There's less poverty than there used to 

1284
01:02:11,201 --> 01:02:12,020
be more education.
Uh,

1285
01:02:12,050 --> 01:02:14,120
but the news has been getting more and 
more morose.

1286
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:19,500
Part of it is also that there's an,
there is an ethic of journalism that to 

1287
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:20,430
be responsible as point out what's going
wrong.

1288
01:02:20,710 --> 01:02:24,810
One editor said,
a good good news isn't news.

1289
01:02:24,811 --> 01:02:29,811
It's advertising.
And it's also because of the timescale 

1290
01:02:29,811 --> 01:02:32,280
that it's very easy to destroy something
really quickly.

1291
01:02:32,430 --> 01:02:34,210
I mean,
something blows up and uh,

1292
01:02:34,270 --> 01:02:39,270
that's news improvements tend to be 
gradual day by day and there's never a 

1293
01:02:39,270 --> 01:02:41,900
Thursday in March in which something 
happens that is,

1294
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:42,520
uh,
as,

1295
01:02:42,521 --> 01:02:44,580
as Max Roser,
an economist Paul pointed out,

1296
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:47,910
newspapers could run the headline.
One hundred and 38,000

1297
01:02:47,911 --> 01:02:50,220
people escaped from extreme poverty 
yesterday,

1298
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:55,700
every day for the last 30 years,
but they never ran that headline even 

1299
01:02:55,700 --> 01:03:00,411
once because there was never a 
particular day in which the hundred and 

1300
01:03:00,411 --> 01:03:02,100
38,000
people were different than 138,000

1301
01:03:02,101 --> 01:03:03,730
people the day before.
And so the,

1302
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:08,910
a lot of the good things kind of creep 
up on us and they're never reported in 

1303
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:12,741
headlines,
whereas it's easy to blow something up 

1304
01:03:12,741 --> 01:03:12,741
and that,
that does happen on a Thursday.

1305
01:03:12,870 --> 01:03:17,870
So you have a,
a very positive view of the future of 

1306
01:03:17,870 --> 01:03:17,870
humans.
Well,

1307
01:03:17,870 --> 01:03:18,860
it's uh,
as,

1308
01:03:18,870 --> 01:03:19,230
as,
uh,

1309
01:03:19,231 --> 01:03:20,160
the great,
uh,

1310
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:21,230
Swedish,
uh,

1311
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:24,900
a dot Ted Takstar,
Hans Rosling put it when he was asked,

1312
01:03:24,901 --> 01:03:26,070
are you an optimist?
And he said,

1313
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:27,180
well,
I'm not an optimist.

1314
01:03:27,181 --> 01:03:32,181
I'm a very serious possible list.
So what happens in the future?

1315
01:03:33,241 --> 01:03:37,800
It depends on what we do now.
And there are real threats and dangers.

1316
01:03:37,830 --> 01:03:40,350
Sure,
there's a possibility of nuclear war.

1317
01:03:40,351 --> 01:03:43,410
There's a possibility of catastrophic 
climate change.

1318
01:03:43,770 --> 01:03:45,990
So we can't sit back and say,
well,

1319
01:03:45,991 --> 01:03:48,660
things have gotten better.
Let's let them continue.

1320
01:03:48,661 --> 01:03:52,050
By sheer inertia or momentum,
that's not gonna happen,

1321
01:03:52,350 --> 01:03:54,900
but what it does indicate is,
well,

1322
01:03:54,901 --> 01:03:58,710
we face crises in the past and uh,
we have made things better.

1323
01:03:58,740 --> 01:04:00,500
Let's figure out how to deal with 
crises.

1324
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:00,900
Now.

1325
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:06,290
That's a great way of looking at it too,
to be realistic about it because the 

1326
01:04:06,290 --> 01:04:08,970
possibility of positive things is a 
real.

1327
01:04:09,130 --> 01:04:14,130
That's real.
But also there's a reason why we find 

1328
01:04:14,130 --> 01:04:16,410
those ruins in Guatemala.
Those people are there anymore.

1329
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:20,640
I mean thriving culture,
thousands of structures,

1330
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:23,790
and now it's a jungle.
Like what happened?

1331
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:25,530
It's,

1332
01:04:25,630 --> 01:04:28,200
it's wise to remember that that can't 
happen.

1333
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:30,930
Didn't become Manhattan.
That's right.

1334
01:04:31,170 --> 01:04:36,170
I mean there is.
I think there is a difference between 

1335
01:04:36,170 --> 01:04:38,070
modern all modern societies and all of 
the ones that did collapse.

1336
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Namely that after the enlightenment we 
developed a kind of a scientific network

1337
01:04:46,050 --> 01:04:51,050
and community.
We develop the habit of free speech and 

1338
01:04:51,050 --> 01:04:55,251
open debate and accumulation of 
information in written in an electronic 

1339
01:04:55,471 --> 01:04:56,580
records.
I mean,

1340
01:04:56,581 --> 01:05:01,290
it is not the same now.
It doesn't mean that we're out of danger

1341
01:05:01,291 --> 01:05:03,150
because we've created new dangers,
you know,

1342
01:05:03,151 --> 01:05:04,410
like,
like nuclear war,

1343
01:05:04,411 --> 01:05:07,070
like climate change.
But there is a,

1344
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:09,990
a,
there are mechanisms in place that if we

1345
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:13,680
concentrate them,
if we are determined to keep doing it,

1346
01:05:13,730 --> 01:05:17,160
then there's a reasonable expectation of
success again,

1347
01:05:17,170 --> 01:05:19,360
but not automatically.
We've got to decide to make.

1348
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:20,500
We've got to make those choices.

1349
01:05:21,330 --> 01:05:22,000
Yeah.
The,

1350
01:05:22,410 --> 01:05:23,110
the,
the,

1351
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:28,120
the,
the history of the human race is so 

1352
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:31,101
weird in terms of the rise and fall of 
these civilizations and cultures that 

1353
01:05:31,171 --> 01:05:34,770
were always a least.
I am always looking at like what,

1354
01:05:34,950 --> 01:05:39,950
how long is this going to last?
Like how long has this one particular 

1355
01:05:39,950 --> 01:05:41,970
nation going to keep it together?
I mean if you look at how many different

1356
01:05:41,971 --> 01:05:44,730
countries have been around that,
just how many,

1357
01:05:44,731 --> 01:05:47,910
you know,
dominant culture is Rome for instance.

1358
01:05:48,210 --> 01:05:51,930
Like just now it's just Italy.
It's just normal,

1359
01:05:52,010 --> 01:05:53,760
you know,
it's like a normal European country.

1360
01:05:54,090 --> 01:05:57,140
It used to be this conquering nation.
Like how,

1361
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:02,200
how long can we keep this thing up and 
what are your thoughts on the future of,

1362
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:08,780
of just even the idea of nations.
It seems like our bout our boundaries 

1363
01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:12,180
and our borders,
the way we have a online,

1364
01:06:12,181 --> 01:06:15,180
this ability to communicate with people 
all over the place,

1365
01:06:15,210 --> 01:06:20,210
everywhere.
It seems to me to lessen the necessary 

1366
01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:23,460
or the need rather for for borders and 
for,

1367
01:06:23,490 --> 01:06:28,490
for these walls that we're now literally
and figuratively talking about putting 

1368
01:06:28,951 --> 01:06:29,220
up.

1369
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:32,500
I think there's going to be a kind of a 
balance.

1370
01:06:32,501 --> 01:06:37,501
It's an interesting thing about nation 
states now is that there is a sense in 

1371
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:42,660
which they're treated as immortal,
that whereas as you mentioned for most 

1372
01:06:42,671 --> 01:06:44,050
of history,
they were conquering.

1373
01:06:44,051 --> 01:06:49,051
Emperors and a nation.
Nations were wiped off the map and 

1374
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:54,700
engulfed and conquered.
And you're now you look at a map of the 

1375
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:54,700
world and,
uh,

1376
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:56,860
it's actually not that different from 
what it was 70 years ago.

1377
01:06:56,920 --> 01:07:01,920
I mean,
there are colonies that achieved 

1378
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,661
independence.
There's some big states like Soviet 

1379
01:07:03,661 --> 01:07:05,790
Union that broke fragmented,
but the borders in between the ribs,

1380
01:07:05,791 --> 01:07:10,791
Soviet republics are now borders between
nation states and no nation has gone out

1381
01:07:11,381 --> 01:07:13,610
of existence through conquest since,
uh,

1382
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:18,640
since 1945,
at least internationally recognized 

1383
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:19,060
state by the,
by the UN.

1384
01:07:19,450 --> 01:07:21,970
So there's this norm,
even though the borders are often,

1385
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:22,840
you know,
crazy.

1386
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:25,630
Then they were arbitrary lines drawn a 
map.

1387
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:28,060
But one of the reasons that,
again,

1388
01:07:28,070 --> 01:07:33,070
this is counterintuitive,
that wars have gone down and deaths and 

1389
01:07:33,070 --> 01:07:36,241
wars have gone down,
is that borders are now treated as 

1390
01:07:36,241 --> 01:07:37,570
sacrosanct by the kind of international 
community.

1391
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:41,740
Not One hundred percent of the time you 
had Russia annexing Crimea,

1392
01:07:42,070 --> 01:07:46,420
but those are exceptions.
And by and large unlike say in the past,

1393
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:50,770
in the 19th century where the US had an 
unpaid debt from Mexico,

1394
01:07:50,771 --> 01:07:51,980
so it conquered,
you know,

1395
01:07:52,030 --> 01:07:55,810
Texas and Colorado and Nevada and 
California,

1396
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:57,490
you know,
that doesn't happen anymore.

1397
01:07:57,700 --> 01:08:02,700
And so the board has kind of been 
grandfathered in and that's one of the 

1398
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:02,700
reasons why the,
uh,

1399
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:03,100
the,
the,

1400
01:08:03,101 --> 01:08:05,200
the world has been more stable in terms 
of the,

1401
01:08:05,201 --> 01:08:05,890
uh,
the map.

1402
01:08:06,220 --> 01:08:07,480
On the other hand,
as you mentioned,

1403
01:08:07,481 --> 01:08:12,481
there's another sense in which we have 
this global community that transcends 

1404
01:08:12,481 --> 01:08:12,940
borders.

1405
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:16,340
We have things like the European Union,
we have the United Nations,

1406
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:21,700
we have a trade agreements like Nafta,
which try to get simultaneously the 

1407
01:08:22,581 --> 01:08:27,500
grandfathered borders,
but this extra layer of cooperation that

1408
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:32,300
transcends the borders and we need them 
more and more despite the fact that our,

1409
01:08:32,310 --> 01:08:36,230
our current president is pushing back 
against the global community,

1410
01:08:37,270 --> 01:08:40,490
but because there are problems that are 
global that my migration,

1411
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:42,560
terrorism,
climate pollution,

1412
01:08:42,650 --> 01:08:44,990
rogue states,
and the fact that people,

1413
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:50,260
even if they,
even if you grew up in France and you 

1414
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:53,231
consider yourself a French citizen,
you want to be able to spend a summer 

1415
01:08:53,231 --> 01:08:53,231
in,
um,

1416
01:08:53,231 --> 01:08:53,231
you know,
in,

1417
01:08:53,231 --> 01:08:58,230
in Italy or in England or in Belgium,
if that's where there's a good job and 

1418
01:08:58,550 --> 01:09:03,550
there's a desire among people to be able
to move to wherever the opportunities 

1419
01:09:03,550 --> 01:09:07,091
are best.
So there's going to be some kind of 

1420
01:09:07,091 --> 01:09:07,091
compromise,
I think,

1421
01:09:07,091 --> 01:09:07,490
between keeping the,
the,

1422
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:12,580
the,
the nation state borders just so you 

1423
01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:12,740
don't have constant wars of conquest and
border disputes,

1424
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:16,820
but allowing the world and allowing the 
people of the world to take advantage of

1425
01:09:16,821 --> 01:09:18,080
a true global community.

1426
01:09:18,470 --> 01:09:23,470
Yeah.
I feel like that's one of the things 

1427
01:09:23,470 --> 01:09:24,070
that people were most upset about brexit
was that this is a,

1428
01:09:25,190 --> 01:09:30,190
even though they,
the people that were pro brexit felt 

1429
01:09:30,190 --> 01:09:33,371
like this was in the interest of the UK 
and the interest of England to be 

1430
01:09:33,531 --> 01:09:38,531
separate from all this because they were
doing better and because they didn't 

1431
01:09:38,531 --> 01:09:41,360
want all the negative possibilities from
all these other places coming into their

1432
01:09:41,361 --> 01:09:43,960
environment.
But the,

1433
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:49,300
what I think that people,
what they didn't like about it was the 

1434
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:53,891
idea that this is a regressive move and 
that the progressive move is that we 

1435
01:09:54,771 --> 01:09:59,771
would all move towards this idea of a 
global community of this entire world 

1436
01:10:02,090 --> 01:10:05,210
being free and connected.
And you know,

1437
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:06,590
we've talked about,
um,

1438
01:10:07,490 --> 01:10:10,340
some of the problems that Paris has with
the immigration.

1439
01:10:10,341 --> 01:10:12,780
We showed some of the videos of these,
uh,

1440
01:10:12,860 --> 01:10:17,860
these immigrants that are just littered 
all over the street and taking this 

1441
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:17,860
place apart.

1442
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:18,230
And we're looking at it going,
man,

1443
01:10:18,231 --> 01:10:19,970
that is a,
that is a real tragedy.

1444
01:10:20,270 --> 01:10:25,270
But what it represents is a bunch of 
people that really don't have anything.

1445
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:30,791
Like.
The real tragedy is that these people 

1446
01:10:30,791 --> 01:10:32,501
live like this.
The real tragedy is not that they've 

1447
01:10:32,501 --> 01:10:34,991
done it to Paris.
The real tragedy is that these people 

1448
01:10:34,991 --> 01:10:37,661
exist at all and that they moved to 
Paris looking for a better life and now 

1449
01:10:37,661 --> 01:10:39,740
they're stuck in the situation where you
know there's not a lot of sanitation and

1450
01:10:39,741 --> 01:10:44,150
the garbage is all over the place.
They're literally everywhere and it's.

1451
01:10:44,630 --> 01:10:49,630
I wonder if we ever will have a world 
where there isn't a place where you can 

1452
01:10:50,991 --> 01:10:55,991
go and ship a factory and pay people a 
dollar an hour because they don't need a

1453
01:10:56,090 --> 01:11:01,090
dollar an hour because it's just like 
living in Los Angeles or just like 

1454
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:05,111
living in Phoenix,
like you would never be able to pay 

1455
01:11:05,111 --> 01:11:05,540
someone a dollar an hour because there's
too much opportunity.

1456
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:08,780
The world has caught up and surpassed 
it.

1457
01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:14,620
Yeah.
There's a number of really complicated 

1458
01:11:14,620 --> 01:11:16,890
issues that they.
Your mobility is in general a good thing

1459
01:11:16,891 --> 01:11:19,560
in countries do well when they welcomed 
Indian immigrants,

1460
01:11:19,890 --> 01:11:22,410
but not on the short term.
Yeah.

1461
01:11:22,411 --> 01:11:23,910
Not too many.
Too fast.

1462
01:11:24,210 --> 01:11:28,110
Faster than they can be assimilated and 
integrated into the new country.

1463
01:11:28,111 --> 01:11:32,400
So it just opening the doors probably is
not a good idea.

1464
01:11:32,401 --> 01:11:36,570
No country really does that,
but building the wall is a terrible idea

1465
01:11:36,571 --> 01:11:38,570
to uh,
and of course the,

1466
01:11:38,571 --> 01:11:39,040
the,
the,

1467
01:11:39,070 --> 01:11:42,590
the best way to prevent a massive 
amounts of,

1468
01:11:42,610 --> 01:11:47,610
of migration is to make life better in 
the countries of origin because that is 

1469
01:11:47,610 --> 01:11:51,770
happening slowly and unevenly.
But it's been noted that even United 

1470
01:11:51,770 --> 01:11:53,760
States and Mexico,
more people are going,

1471
01:11:54,270 --> 01:11:59,270
or the same number of people are doing 
the reverse migration from the US back 

1472
01:11:59,270 --> 01:12:02,760
to Mexico now that the economy of Mexico
so much my own parents when 25 years.

1473
01:12:02,850 --> 01:12:03,630
Okay.
Yeah.

1474
01:12:03,631 --> 01:12:05,040
My parents live in Mexico.
Okay.

1475
01:12:05,041 --> 01:12:05,770
There you go.
Yeah.

1476
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:08,160
Um,
and there is a,

1477
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:09,150
a,
um,

1478
01:12:09,930 --> 01:12:14,930
a harder to detect,
but there is a huge improvement in the 

1479
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:15,660
standard of living in what used to be 
called the third world,

1480
01:12:15,690 --> 01:12:17,510
the developing world where,
um,

1481
01:12:18,620 --> 01:12:23,620
the,
if you look at the cutoff for extreme 

1482
01:12:23,620 --> 01:12:23,760
poverty kind of defined,
defined somewhat arbitrarily is a dollar

1483
01:12:23,761 --> 01:12:26,280
90 per person per day,
kind of the bare,

1484
01:12:26,281 --> 01:12:27,960
bare,
bare minimum to feed,

1485
01:12:28,050 --> 01:12:29,760
feed your family.
Uh,

1486
01:12:30,290 --> 01:12:35,290
it's down now from a 50 percent a few 
decades ago to 10 percent now,

1487
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:39,060
and the United Nations have set the goal
of bringing it to zero by the year 20,

1488
01:12:39,061 --> 01:12:40,230
30,
and what street,

1489
01:12:40,231 --> 01:12:42,660
what is causing that?
What's causing the change?

1490
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:44,520
So a lot of it is,
um,

1491
01:12:44,550 --> 01:12:49,550
globalization that,
I mean even though that's kind of a 

1492
01:12:49,550 --> 01:12:50,800
villain in many people's eyes,
but when you have a,

1493
01:12:51,170 --> 01:12:56,170
a,
a huge global market than a and the 

1494
01:12:56,170 --> 01:12:56,170
introduction of,
of uh,

1495
01:12:56,170 --> 01:12:58,290
factories and industrialization in 
China,

1496
01:12:58,291 --> 01:13:02,010
in India and Bangladesh,
sometimes the conditions are grim,

1497
01:13:02,011 --> 01:13:05,580
but the conditions being a peasant in 
the rice patties was even grimmer.

1498
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:10,820
And when,
when you have a people integrated with 

1499
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:11,340
the economy,
selling their products on a world stage,

1500
01:13:11,530 --> 01:13:12,570
uh,
they can get richer.

1501
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:18,080
And so a lot of also better policies.
We have governments that are no longer a

1502
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:24,740
communist or like really heavy handed 
forms of socialism where everything is 

1503
01:13:24,930 --> 01:13:29,930
defined by the bureaucrats.
And you need 50 licenses to do anything 

1504
01:13:29,930 --> 01:13:33,891
and you have a little bit more economic 
flexibility that tends to make the 

1505
01:13:33,891 --> 01:13:38,300
country's richer.
It doesn't mean that you could do away 

1506
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:39,920
with regulations on workplace safety 
and,

1507
01:13:39,921 --> 01:13:40,480
and,
uh,

1508
01:13:40,570 --> 01:13:45,030
environment and as countries get richer,
they tend to be more protective of their

1509
01:13:45,031 --> 01:13:47,150
workers and the environment,
right?

1510
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:53,280
And leaders that think of their mandate 
as how do I get my country to be richer?

1511
01:13:54,020 --> 01:13:56,250
And the most dramatic case was China 
where,

1512
01:13:56,310 --> 01:13:56,960
uh,
you know,

1513
01:13:57,100 --> 01:14:02,100
Mao had these harebrained schemes have 
huge collective farms and people 

1514
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:05,090
smelting iron in their backyards and you
know,

1515
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:06,960
anything that occurred to him in the 
middle of the night,

1516
01:14:06,961 --> 01:14:11,961
he would force on hundreds of millions 
of people and it cost these massive 

1517
01:14:11,961 --> 01:14:12,130
famines.
Then Deng,

1518
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:15,730
Deng Xiaoping took over and he said,
getting Richard Good,

1519
01:14:16,370 --> 01:14:17,590
uh,
and he said,

1520
01:14:17,710 --> 01:14:19,000
black cat,
white cat,

1521
01:14:19,030 --> 01:14:21,010
as long as it catches mice,
it's a good cat.

1522
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:26,320
So much more pragmatic,
much more concerned with the welfare of 

1523
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:29,581
their citizens.
When you have leaders who have that 

1524
01:14:29,581 --> 01:14:30,250
mindset,
then the country can,

1525
01:14:30,310 --> 01:14:35,310
can get,
get wealthier and their citizens better 

1526
01:14:35,310 --> 01:14:35,310
off

1527
01:14:35,310 --> 01:14:36,300
now.
But are you concerned?

1528
01:14:36,750 --> 01:14:37,250
I mean,
I,

1529
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:42,500
I agree with you that it is probably is 
one of the reasons why these people are 

1530
01:14:42,930 --> 01:14:47,300
experiencing this greater quality of 
life is because of globalization because

1531
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:52,320
these factories moving in,
but they're living lives that are very 

1532
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:54,540
different and maybe perhaps it's by our 
standards that their lives are better.

1533
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:59,900
That may be if these indigenous people 
were living this sort of subsistence 

1534
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:03,510
lifestyle that even though on paper they
would be existing in extreme poverty,

1535
01:15:03,810 --> 01:15:08,810
but if they're perhaps like living in 
the jungle or somewhere along those 

1536
01:15:08,810 --> 01:15:12,861
lines where you have access to all these
natural resources that even though 

1537
01:15:12,861 --> 01:15:14,820
they'd be living in extreme poverty,
they'd be living maybe,

1538
01:15:14,821 --> 01:15:19,821
perhaps even a better life by just 
eating the fish and eating the plants 

1539
01:15:19,821 --> 01:15:22,740
and hunting and fishing and doing what 
they had normally done for thousands and

1540
01:15:22,741 --> 01:15:26,310
thousands of years rather than making a 
dollar an hour and a Nike factory.

1541
01:15:26,570 --> 01:15:31,570
Right.
And it's certainly true that indigenous 

1542
01:15:31,570 --> 01:15:34,720
peoples who are living in a hunter and 
horticultural lifestyles,

1543
01:15:34,851 --> 01:15:38,240
that there are real crimes in displacing
them often.

1544
01:15:38,241 --> 01:15:42,230
Not so much by factories but by miners 
and loggers.

1545
01:15:42,790 --> 01:15:43,470
But the,
the,

1546
01:15:43,650 --> 01:15:46,850
there are a very tiny fraction of the 
world's population,

1547
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:48,230
tragically,
uh,

1548
01:15:48,430 --> 01:15:51,950
the vast majority of poor people or more
are peasants,

1549
01:15:52,130 --> 01:15:53,840
not,
not,

1550
01:15:53,850 --> 01:15:55,430
not,
not horticulturalists.

1551
01:15:55,431 --> 01:15:56,840
And,
and you know,

1552
01:15:56,841 --> 01:16:01,841
they are kind of agricultural laborers 
and for them just based on their own 

1553
01:16:02,420 --> 01:16:03,860
choices,
uh,

1554
01:16:03,861 --> 01:16:06,380
often the factory life is a,
is an improvement.

1555
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:11,560
It's an improvement,
not just because they're not a kind of 

1556
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:14,500
in the fields,
knee deep in muck a pulling up seedlings

1557
01:16:14,501 --> 01:16:17,960
and getting bitten by disease carrying a
bugs.

1558
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:19,270
But,
um,

1559
01:16:19,850 --> 01:16:20,850
for women,
uh,

1560
01:16:21,050 --> 01:16:26,050
being able to move from a,
a village to a city often means 

1561
01:16:26,050 --> 01:16:28,910
liberation that they can start a 
business and the kids to school,

1562
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:34,240
uh,
be out from under the thumbs of their 

1563
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:35,080
husbands and the husband's family.
They're kind of can be a liberation just

1564
01:16:35,130 --> 01:16:40,130
just as what our aunts,
our ancestors did when they left the 

1565
01:16:40,130 --> 01:16:40,970
farms for cities a hundred and 50 years 
ago.

1566
01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:44,960
So not to say there isn't exploitation 
and,

1567
01:16:44,961 --> 01:16:47,660
uh,
and cruelty which ought to be opposed.

1568
01:16:47,661 --> 01:16:49,840
And in the case of native peoples,
often,

1569
01:16:50,090 --> 01:16:50,990
you know,
criminal,

1570
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:52,130
uh,
displacements.

1571
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:57,520
But on the whole globalization has led 
to this escape from grinding poverty for

1572
01:16:59,570 --> 01:17:01,190
literally hundreds of millions of 
people.

1573
01:17:01,490 --> 01:17:06,490
So even when they moved these factories 
into these places in charge or pay them 

1574
01:17:06,490 --> 01:17:07,190
a dollar an hour,
rather,

1575
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:10,040
it still a dollar an hour than

1576
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:12,290
they would've gotten if the factory had 
been there.

1577
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:13,970
In many cases.
That's true.

1578
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:16,500
Which exploitation.
But you know,

1579
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:17,740
we look at our and said,
you know,

1580
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:20,700
my grandparents worked in a clothing 
factory and uh,

1581
01:17:21,070 --> 01:17:26,070
when they emigrated from Poland to 
Canada and it often is a route to upward

1582
01:17:26,961 --> 01:17:28,670
mobility.
Yeah,

1583
01:17:28,671 --> 01:17:33,671
it's,
it's hard for us to accept that or even 

1584
01:17:33,671 --> 01:17:33,671
think about it that way because it was 
saying,

1585
01:17:33,671 --> 01:17:33,671
well,
why?

1586
01:17:33,671 --> 01:17:38,110
How come they don't have to pay these 
Mexican folks minimum wage just like 

1587
01:17:38,110 --> 01:17:38,110
they do in America?
Like,

1588
01:17:38,110 --> 01:17:42,821
well,
why don't they have the same sort of 

1589
01:17:42,821 --> 01:17:42,821
setup we do here?
Just seems cruel.

1590
01:17:42,821 --> 01:17:44,240
It doesn't impair,
no doubt there is cruelty.

1591
01:17:44,420 --> 01:17:45,760
But the relevant

1592
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:50,840
Harrison is not so much a difference 
between working in a factory there and 

1593
01:17:51,001 --> 01:17:52,430
working in an office,
you know,

1594
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:57,000
in Berkeley or Manhattan.
It's the difference between working in a

1595
01:17:57,001 --> 01:17:57,450
factory

1596
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:59,040
there and,
uh,

1597
01:17:59,230 --> 01:18:01,150
and,
and laboring in the fields there.

1598
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:03,970
And the people are often given that 
choice.

1599
01:18:04,030 --> 01:18:09,030
They line up to the factory jobs.
Do you anticipate a time where there is 

1600
01:18:09,030 --> 01:18:13,321
no third world and there is no,
it's a massive economic disparity.

1601
01:18:13,650 --> 01:18:15,650
It's conceivable,
um,

1602
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:17,670
you know,
it's a ways off,

1603
01:18:18,090 --> 01:18:20,460
but it's happened in huge parts of the 
world.

1604
01:18:20,461 --> 01:18:25,461
I mean,
we forget that places like South Korea 

1605
01:18:25,461 --> 01:18:25,461
now,
you know,

1606
01:18:25,461 --> 01:18:27,090
this rich,
a upper middle class society,

1607
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:28,920
uh,
not so long ago.

1608
01:18:28,921 --> 01:18:30,510
That was the third world.
I mean,

1609
01:18:30,511 --> 01:18:31,680
they were,
they were hungry.

1610
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:32,950
They were,
uh,

1611
01:18:33,170 --> 01:18:33,620
the,
the,

1612
01:18:33,650 --> 01:18:35,520
the,
the children died young.

1613
01:18:36,060 --> 01:18:38,970
A lot of them living in squalor.
Uh,

1614
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,300
and that was true in certainly in China.
Lots of parts of places,

1615
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:46,740
parts of China now that are pretty much 
middle class that we're a squalid not so

1616
01:18:46,741 --> 01:18:48,690
long ago,
a Singapore.

1617
01:18:49,170 --> 01:18:50,080
Uh,
I have,

1618
01:18:50,081 --> 01:18:52,170
uh,
an anecdote in the book of enlightenment

1619
01:18:52,171 --> 01:18:57,171
now with my ex mother in law who grew up
in Singapore and she remembers a 

1620
01:18:57,171 --> 01:19:00,840
childhood meal in which her family split
one egg for ways.

1621
01:19:01,330 --> 01:19:02,610
I was back in the,
uh,

1622
01:19:02,611 --> 01:19:07,611
in the 19 forties,
Singapore is now one of the world's 

1623
01:19:07,611 --> 01:19:08,310
richest countries,
so it can happen.

1624
01:19:08,370 --> 01:19:11,730
It is happening.
The most remote,

1625
01:19:11,731 --> 01:19:16,731
poorest parts of the world are going to 
be the hardest to bring up to middle 

1626
01:19:16,731 --> 01:19:16,731
class standards.
Like,

1627
01:19:16,731 --> 01:19:17,850
you know,
Congo like Haiti,

1628
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:20,820
like Afghanistan,
but large parts of the world.

1629
01:19:20,821 --> 01:19:23,070
There's been a huge increase in the 
standard of living.

1630
01:19:23,990 --> 01:19:27,920
Um,
you talked recently about the dangers of

1631
01:19:28,910 --> 01:19:33,910
overly politically correct thinking of 
or just politically correct thinking of 

1632
01:19:34,860 --> 01:19:39,860
have a sort of a rebound effect where 
political correct thinking is actually 

1633
01:19:40,941 --> 01:19:42,990
causing more extremism,
uh,

1634
01:19:42,991 --> 01:19:47,240
more and more radical thinking in new,
in terms of response to that,

1635
01:19:47,870 --> 01:19:52,320
like an overcorrection at the,
at the top of our conversation we

1636
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:57,320
talked about the possibility of,
of sex differences as being kind of 

1637
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:59,100
taboo from polite company.
And in a lot.

1638
01:19:59,110 --> 01:20:04,110
I'll give another example,
and this is kind of connects to our 

1639
01:20:04,110 --> 01:20:04,730
conversation,
isn't a lot of academia.

1640
01:20:04,780 --> 01:20:09,780
There's just capitalism is just a dirty 
word or something now called the Neo 

1641
01:20:09,780 --> 01:20:11,780
liberalism and you know,
a,

1642
01:20:11,950 --> 01:20:13,560
a,
a certain percentage.

1643
01:20:13,590 --> 01:20:18,590
Surprisingly,
large percentage of academics are 

1644
01:20:18,590 --> 01:20:20,811
actually Marxists,
probably about 15 percent in the social 

1645
01:20:20,811 --> 01:20:20,811
sciences,
uh,

1646
01:20:20,811 --> 01:20:24,980
and uh,
to say the obvious fact that capitalism 

1647
01:20:24,980 --> 01:20:26,380
is better than communism.
I mean,

1648
01:20:26,390 --> 01:20:27,450
that's just a fact.
I mean,

1649
01:20:27,451 --> 01:20:32,451
just compared,
we would rather live in South Korea or 

1650
01:20:32,451 --> 01:20:33,330
North Korea would rather live in the old
East Germany or West Germany,

1651
01:20:33,810 --> 01:20:38,810
a I'd rather live now in Venezuela or in
Chile and it's just obvious that 

1652
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:44,120
capitalism makes people a richer and 
freer and better off in pretty much 

1653
01:20:44,221 --> 01:20:45,810
every way.
Now.

1654
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:46,680
That's a fact.

1655
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:49,920
That's almost unmentionable in academia 
now,

1656
01:20:50,130 --> 01:20:55,130
but he say it by itself and suddenly 
people discover it for the first time.

1657
01:20:55,200 --> 01:21:00,200
Then you can get the extreme right wing 
position that any amount of regulation 

1658
01:21:00,481 --> 01:21:03,990
is bad.
Any amount of social spending is bad.

1659
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:09,200
We need the most extreme form of almost 
an arco capitalism like radical 

1660
01:21:09,721 --> 01:21:14,721
libertarianism.
And that's because I argue that if you 

1661
01:21:14,721 --> 01:21:19,341
never have a discussion of the relative 
advantages and disadvantages of 

1662
01:21:19,341 --> 01:21:23,241
different economic systems,
you never hear the arguments for why 

1663
01:21:23,241 --> 01:21:27,020
some mixture of a free market with 
regulation of things that have to be 

1664
01:21:27,451 --> 01:21:29,370
regulated because the market won't take 
care of them,

1665
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:32,220
like pollution.
I mean the market just won't put up,

1666
01:21:32,700 --> 01:21:35,910
put a price on the atmosphere because no
one owns the atmosphere.

1667
01:21:36,210 --> 01:21:41,210
And so having a combination of a free 
market with environmental regulations 

1668
01:21:41,210 --> 01:21:42,270
gives you the best of both worlds.

1669
01:21:42,570 --> 01:21:45,510
Likewise,
social spending for the elderly,

1670
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:47,310
for children,
for the sick,

1671
01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:52,340
for the unlucky,
a bath not incompatible with a free 

1672
01:21:52,340 --> 01:21:56,151
market,
and in fact some of the countries who 

1673
01:21:56,151 --> 01:21:58,131
have the strongest social safety nets,
also one of the ones with the most 

1674
01:21:58,131 --> 01:22:01,101
economic freedom.
So that argument that I've just given 

1675
01:22:01,101 --> 01:22:04,431
you right now just doesn't take place 
because there's just such a commitment 

1676
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:09,560
to the idea that capitalism is bad.
Opening up the possibility that someone 

1677
01:22:09,751 --> 01:22:14,751
discovers hate capitalism isn't so bad,
then they reap to the strongest possible

1678
01:22:14,791 --> 01:22:15,900
conclusion.
Well,

1679
01:22:15,901 --> 01:22:20,100
if as soon as you have social security,
then we're going to be like Venezuela,

1680
01:22:20,130 --> 01:22:22,010
Venezuela,
or or,

1681
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:22,560
or,
or,

1682
01:22:22,561 --> 01:22:27,561
or our carbon pricing and the rational 
way of organizing society with just the 

1683
01:22:27,561 --> 01:22:30,480
right balance of free markets.
Regulation.

1684
01:22:30,481 --> 01:22:34,020
Social spending is just something that 
doesn't get discussed out in the open.

1685
01:22:34,050 --> 01:22:38,310
You get these polarized extremes and 
that that's the argument that what's the

1686
01:22:38,311 --> 01:22:40,770
origin of that thought process in 
academia?

1687
01:22:40,770 --> 01:22:45,450
Like why has capitalism and demonized 
and socialism being been praised despite

1688
01:22:45,451 --> 01:22:49,680
all the evidence that especially Marxist
socialism or Marxism is just,

1689
01:22:49,681 --> 01:22:54,681
it's never been shown to be effective 
and it's been shown to be very 

1690
01:22:54,681 --> 01:22:54,681
dangerous.
Yeah,

1691
01:22:54,681 --> 01:22:58,190
it's a good question.
One theory from Thomas Sowell,

1692
01:22:58,250 --> 01:23:03,250
an economist at the hoover institution 
is that intellectuals tend to like 

1693
01:23:03,250 --> 01:23:07,790
systems that where you can articulate a 
theory and a bunch of verbal 

1694
01:23:07,790 --> 01:23:11,110
propositions and you know,
the government kind of implements them.

1695
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:14,090
Whereas there are certain phenomena in,
in,

1696
01:23:14,130 --> 01:23:19,130
in social life like market economies 
where the intelligence is distributed 

1697
01:23:19,130 --> 01:23:23,761
across millions of people.
No one actually knows how to make the 

1698
01:23:23,761 --> 01:23:25,780
system work,
but people make things look for buyers.

1699
01:23:25,810 --> 01:23:28,780
They set the price where people will,
will buy them,

1700
01:23:29,710 --> 01:23:33,730
and then over the entire society,
things kind of work out,

1701
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:38,880
but no one,
actually no single individual has the 

1702
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,330
theory as to how that ought to work.

1703
01:23:40,630 --> 01:23:42,460
Uh,
language is another example.

1704
01:23:42,490 --> 01:23:47,490
I mean,
there's no committee that designed the 

1705
01:23:47,490 --> 01:23:48,991
English language.
There is no theory of how the English 

1706
01:23:48,991 --> 01:23:50,080
language ought to work.
It's like hundreds of millions of people

1707
01:23:50,081 --> 01:23:55,081
just talking and they invent new slang 
and they slur and they emphasize and 

1708
01:23:55,331 --> 01:24:00,331
they borrow from other languages.
And the language changes and it works 

1709
01:24:00,331 --> 01:24:04,951
pretty well.
Here we are speaking in English and no 

1710
01:24:04,951 --> 01:24:05,700
committee ever designed it.
So according to souls theory and he,

1711
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:08,890
I think he was influenced by a High Eq 
Friedrich Hayek,

1712
01:24:08,891 --> 01:24:13,891
the Austrian economist,
that systems of distributed intelligence

1713
01:24:14,650 --> 01:24:18,930
where no one genius ever designed it,
but millions of people cooperating,

1714
01:24:18,940 --> 01:24:22,810
give rise to a collective intelligence 
kind of run against the grain or the way

1715
01:24:22,811 --> 01:24:26,290
intellectuals often think,
not all intellectuals,

1716
01:24:26,291 --> 01:24:31,291
because of course you could do what high
console did and realized there is this 

1717
01:24:31,291 --> 01:24:36,031
phenomenon of collective intelligence.
But if your first impulse is what's the 

1718
01:24:36,031 --> 01:24:37,040
theory,
uh,

1719
01:24:37,550 --> 01:24:39,040
you know,
what are the set of principles,

1720
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:41,410
then you're going to gravitate to 
planned,

1721
01:24:41,730 --> 01:24:46,730
you know,
hyper plan systems and the a little bit 

1722
01:24:46,730 --> 01:24:47,620
oblivious to distributed systems,

1723
01:24:48,970 --> 01:24:53,970
but in academia for whatever reason,
looking at things in terms of a,

1724
01:24:55,690 --> 01:25:00,690
from a social standpoint,
looking at things is a distribution of 

1725
01:25:00,690 --> 01:25:03,811
wealth is a big,
a common subject that keeps getting 

1726
01:25:03,811 --> 01:25:07,471
brought up and class structures that 
there's going to be a time if everything

1727
01:25:09,371 --> 01:25:14,371
works out correctly.
If we continue to evolve our culture 

1728
01:25:14,371 --> 01:25:18,180
where we will no longer have classes,
we'll know and we'll be able to 

1729
01:25:18,180 --> 01:25:20,350
distribute wealth completely equally 
across the board,

1730
01:25:20,710 --> 01:25:25,450
but it sort of denying the motivation 
that human beings have to succeed.

1731
01:25:25,830 --> 01:25:30,830
It's designing the denying this desire 
that people have to stand out and to 

1732
01:25:32,651 --> 01:25:34,670
overachieve or to,
to be,

1733
01:25:34,710 --> 01:25:37,210
to be an outlier in terms of 
performance,

1734
01:25:37,211 --> 01:25:41,350
which is just a natural part of human 
beings and also competition.

1735
01:25:41,590 --> 01:25:46,360
That competition is fueled by reward and
without competition,

1736
01:25:46,361 --> 01:25:49,990
you don't have iphones.
You don't have most of the technological

1737
01:25:49,991 --> 01:25:54,991
innovation that we have that's been 
funded by these companies have done it 

1738
01:25:54,991 --> 01:25:56,460
in order to make money.
There's,

1739
01:25:56,520 --> 01:25:59,710
there's to be some sort of a reason why 
they pushed all these things.

1740
01:25:59,980 --> 01:26:04,340
It's so ironic when someone is talking 
about how capitalism sucks

1741
01:26:04,490 --> 01:26:06,460
on an iphone.
I mean,

1742
01:26:06,470 --> 01:26:11,470
didn't Jesus Christ.
That is one of the more bizarre ironies 

1743
01:26:11,470 --> 01:26:15,800
is unexposed.
Will you put your finger on another 

1744
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:16,430
phenomenon?
And I discussed this in my book,

1745
01:26:16,431 --> 01:26:21,431
the blank slate when I also discussed 
the kind of the politics of gender that 

1746
01:26:21,431 --> 01:26:25,360
part of it is there's a history to it.
So there was an idea sometimes called 

1747
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:26,300
social darwinism.
It wasn't,

1748
01:26:26,510 --> 01:26:28,280
it had nothing to do with Darwin and 
ironically,

1749
01:26:28,490 --> 01:26:33,490
but the idea that the only way society's
progresses through ruthless cutthroat 

1750
01:26:33,490 --> 01:26:37,230
competition and poor people are just 
dragging the species down and you know,

1751
01:26:37,310 --> 01:26:40,490
screw them,
and if we were were were bleeding hearts

1752
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:42,980
than will retard the progress of 
society.

1753
01:26:42,981 --> 01:26:43,740
And we need,
you know,

1754
01:26:43,830 --> 01:26:47,570
just everyone against everyone else for 
two to advance.

1755
01:26:47,870 --> 01:26:51,200
Now you know that that's really not a 
very good way to organize a society.

1756
01:26:51,201 --> 01:26:56,201
But there's such a reaction against that
in the 20th century that you got the 

1757
01:26:56,201 --> 01:26:59,330
opposite extreme,
that we are all blank slates.

1758
01:26:59,390 --> 01:27:03,410
That is,
we all start off a identical and that,

1759
01:27:03,700 --> 01:27:05,690
uh,
any kind of competition is bad.

1760
01:27:05,691 --> 01:27:10,691
You need kind of this,
the benevolent government to distribute 

1761
01:27:10,691 --> 01:27:11,120
everything in the fairest possible 
manner.

1762
01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:12,890
Now,
the reality is,

1763
01:27:13,100 --> 01:27:15,970
is something in between,
we are a,

1764
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:21,040
there's going to be an equality in any 
fair system simply because some people 

1765
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:25,271
really are smarter than others and some 
people have more discipline and more 

1766
01:27:25,271 --> 01:27:28,331
self control and uh,
and it's good to harness that so that 

1767
01:27:28,610 --> 01:27:33,610
our competitive impulses have some 
people burning the midnight oil and 

1768
01:27:34,941 --> 01:27:39,941
racking their brains to how to make 
things better off because they 

1769
01:27:39,941 --> 01:27:42,950
anticipate some rewards.
You don't want to sap all incentives,

1770
01:27:42,980 --> 01:27:45,380
which is kind of what happened in the 
Soviet Union.

1771
01:27:46,430 --> 01:27:51,430
You also don't want a central committee 
to decide that everyone has to have the 

1772
01:27:51,870 --> 01:27:56,870
same amount and parcel out every reward 
because that just gives too much power 

1773
01:27:57,321 --> 01:27:58,130
to a government.

1774
01:27:58,580 --> 01:28:01,440
But it also doesn't mean that you have 
the opposite extreme where the,

1775
01:28:01,590 --> 01:28:02,960
you know,
the poor people die,

1776
01:28:02,961 --> 01:28:05,030
then it's their own fault because 
they're lazy and stupid.

1777
01:28:05,090 --> 01:28:06,530
I mean,
that's just not true.

1778
01:28:06,770 --> 01:28:10,010
It's not humane.
And what we need to do is find the right

1779
01:28:10,011 --> 01:28:15,011
balance between competition and freedom 
that makes everyone better off and 

1780
01:28:16,220 --> 01:28:20,930
recognition that just be,
there are going to be people who are not

1781
01:28:20,931 --> 01:28:23,640
as smart,
but they don't deserve to starve a,

1782
01:28:23,660 --> 01:28:26,900
there are people who are just going to 
be unlucky because a lot of wealth isn't

1783
01:28:26,901 --> 01:28:31,901
distributed by a talent and hard work,
but there's a lot of luck that goes into

1784
01:28:32,061 --> 01:28:34,340
it as well.
And so we may want to kind of,

1785
01:28:34,390 --> 01:28:39,390
uh,
a sand down some of the sharp edges of 

1786
01:28:39,390 --> 01:28:39,390
competition.
There it,

1787
01:28:39,390 --> 01:28:40,400
it doesn't have to be either or.
And the thing is,

1788
01:28:40,401 --> 01:28:43,460
if you make one position taboo,
then it makes things either or.

1789
01:28:43,910 --> 01:28:48,910
But how bizarre is it that these kinds 
of rational conversations about this 

1790
01:28:48,910 --> 01:28:52,631
very important subject is taboo in 
intellectual circles and it's not good 

1791
01:28:53,271 --> 01:28:54,980
academia.
How did that happen?

1792
01:28:55,010 --> 01:28:55,730
It's not good.
I,

1793
01:28:55,740 --> 01:29:00,740
you know,
I think some of it is a reaction to the 

1794
01:29:00,740 --> 01:29:00,740
excesses of the past,
some of it,

1795
01:29:00,740 --> 01:29:05,381
because people do tend to form a kind of
intellectual tribes the same way you 

1796
01:29:05,381 --> 01:29:06,300
have sports teams,
uh,

1797
01:29:06,301 --> 01:29:09,930
and you root for your team and you know,
and when you're a sports fan,

1798
01:29:09,990 --> 01:29:14,990
when you acquire information isn't to 
become better and better informed in 

1799
01:29:15,451 --> 01:29:20,451
some objective way.
It's to kind of enhance the fan 

1800
01:29:20,451 --> 01:29:23,121
experience.
You want to find out what's great about 

1801
01:29:23,121 --> 01:29:23,580
your team and what's awful about the 
other team.

1802
01:29:23,850 --> 01:29:28,850
And that's a human habit that we bring 
to intellectual debates where and,

1803
01:29:29,540 --> 01:29:34,540
and academia,
academics or are susceptible to it as 

1804
01:29:34,540 --> 01:29:34,540
anyone.

1805
01:29:34,540 --> 01:29:39,050
Anyone else,
unless they take steps to recognize it 

1806
01:29:39,050 --> 01:29:39,050
and avoid it.
But you know,

1807
01:29:39,050 --> 01:29:40,050
if you're on the left,
you root for the left team and if you're

1808
01:29:40,051 --> 01:29:45,051
on the right,
not so much in the universities but in 

1809
01:29:45,051 --> 01:29:45,930
the think tanks,
you root for the right team and you tend

1810
01:29:45,931 --> 01:29:49,800
to discount evidence that goes against 
your ideology.

1811
01:29:49,801 --> 01:29:52,980
You kind of filter out the things that 
are a little bit embarrassing.

1812
01:29:53,770 --> 01:29:55,470
Uh,
and uh,

1813
01:29:55,980 --> 01:30:00,980
uh,
people then a adopt certain opinions is 

1814
01:30:00,980 --> 01:30:04,701
almost loyalty badges and this is true 
of a lot of controversies that people 

1815
01:30:04,921 --> 01:30:07,890
often think are due to scientific 
illiteracy,

1816
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:11,610
like climate change where you ask a lot 
of scientists,

1817
01:30:11,611 --> 01:30:15,570
why do people deny the obvious facts of,
of manmade climate change.

1818
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:16,500
And I think,
well,

1819
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:20,280
people just don't get enough information
that we need better outreach and I think

1820
01:30:20,281 --> 01:30:22,470
we do need better outreach,
but in fact,

1821
01:30:22,530 --> 01:30:25,020
and I talk about this and enlightenment 
and enlightenment now,

1822
01:30:25,021 --> 01:30:29,790
if you actually do surveys of how well 
people understand climate science is not

1823
01:30:30,180 --> 01:30:33,480
virtually no correlation between 
acknowledgement of human made,

1824
01:30:33,481 --> 01:30:36,930
climate change and sophistication in 
climate science.

1825
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:40,170
So you get people who do believe in 
human made climate change,

1826
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:43,740
which I think is an incontrovertible 
fact at this point,

1827
01:30:44,070 --> 01:30:45,840
but they don't really understand it.
I mean,

1828
01:30:45,841 --> 01:30:46,980
they may even think,
oh,

1829
01:30:46,981 --> 01:30:51,981
it's caused by a hole in the ozone layer
and we can fix it by cleaning up toxic 

1830
01:30:51,981 --> 01:30:54,780
waste dumps me like crazy beliefs,
but they're still on.

1831
01:30:54,810 --> 01:30:56,040
You know,
what I would consider the right,

1832
01:30:56,140 --> 01:31:00,000
the right side.
What happens is that in some politicized

1833
01:31:00,001 --> 01:31:02,580
debates,
the people don't,

1834
01:31:02,640 --> 01:31:07,640
don't so much care about the truth.
They care about what belief will earn 

1835
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:08,220
them esteem in their,
their peer group.

1836
01:31:08,250 --> 01:31:09,120
Right?
Right.

1837
01:31:09,230 --> 01:31:14,230
This is human psychology,
but it's really bad when it comes to 

1838
01:31:14,230 --> 01:31:18,590
arriving at the best understanding of 
the truth collectively and what we need 

1839
01:31:18,590 --> 01:31:23,540
both in the left wing academic 
departments and the right wing think 

1840
01:31:23,540 --> 01:31:24,210
tanks is kind of recognition.

1841
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:27,090
We're probably all wrong about a lot of 
things,

1842
01:31:27,150 --> 01:31:32,150
especially if we talk to each other and,
and act like kind of litigators like 

1843
01:31:32,191 --> 01:31:37,191
lawyers who mouth the best possible case
for our side to prosecuted against the 

1844
01:31:37,191 --> 01:31:42,171
other side.
That's just not a good way of arriving 

1845
01:31:42,171 --> 01:31:44,481
at the truth.
You've got to kind of check the 

1846
01:31:44,481 --> 01:31:47,451
tendencies in yourself to just want more
and more evidence for your belief and 

1847
01:31:47,940 --> 01:31:51,630
force yourself to be enforced other 
people to be as open minded as possible.

1848
01:31:51,990 --> 01:31:54,000
Yeah.
It's very fascinating to me.

1849
01:31:54,010 --> 01:31:54,930
These,
um,

1850
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:57,930
these sort of mindsets that,
uh,

1851
01:31:57,960 --> 01:31:59,980
that you on the left

1852
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:04,980
and on the right,
that there are certain subjects that 

1853
01:32:04,980 --> 01:32:04,980
you,
if you support that subject,

1854
01:32:04,980 --> 01:32:06,190
you are automatically thought of as a 
left winger.

1855
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:11,400
Have you support this subject?
You're already automatically thought of 

1856
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:12,370
as a rule if you were on the right,
you probably think,

1857
01:32:12,490 --> 01:32:14,020
yeah,
in some way,

1858
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:19,160
like if,
if someone says to me that they think 

1859
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:22,531
that climate change is probably an 
overblown thing and it's a cycle that 

1860
01:32:22,531 --> 01:32:24,040
the world has been going through 
forever,

1861
01:32:24,130 --> 01:32:29,130
I go,
you're a right winger and you'd be 

1862
01:32:29,130 --> 01:32:29,130
right.
Yeah.

1863
01:32:29,130 --> 01:32:29,130
Almost always,
always,

1864
01:32:29,130 --> 01:32:29,800
always.
And if you think,

1865
01:32:29,801 --> 01:32:34,801
you know,
all gay people should be allowed to get 

1866
01:32:34,801 --> 01:32:34,801
married.
Who Cares?

1867
01:32:34,801 --> 01:32:34,801
Oh,
you're probably left winger.

1868
01:32:34,801 --> 01:32:36,080
Yeah,
that's probably true 10 years ago.

1869
01:32:36,081 --> 01:32:39,020
And it's actually less true now.
That's what these amazing changes.

1870
01:32:39,350 --> 01:32:44,350
So sometimes there can be these changes.
They just catch us all by surprise and 

1871
01:32:44,350 --> 01:32:45,140
gay marriage is one of them.
I mean that was like,

1872
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:49,340
even people on the left had misgivings 
about climate change.

1873
01:32:49,510 --> 01:32:50,930
I've ever been gay marriage.
I'm sorry,

1874
01:32:50,931 --> 01:32:54,350
in the nineties it was still something 
that a lot of people on the left,

1875
01:32:54,351 --> 01:32:56,390
we're kind of had let him,
let's not go that far.

1876
01:32:56,391 --> 01:32:58,530
Maybe we should have civil unions or you
know,

1877
01:32:59,720 --> 01:33:03,880
now the whole of the country is flipped,
but you.

1878
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:06,620
But in general so these changes can 
happen,

1879
01:33:06,621 --> 01:33:11,621
but you're right that a lot of opinions 
are just loyalty badges to a coalition 

1880
01:33:12,050 --> 01:33:14,750
and they can sometimes change in very 
strange ways.

1881
01:33:14,751 --> 01:33:19,751
So we've seen it in the last year or so 
with a Donald Trump who is in many ways 

1882
01:33:22,011 --> 01:33:25,670
that pretty radical right winger in 
things like,

1883
01:33:26,210 --> 01:33:26,870
what do you think?

1884
01:33:26,930 --> 01:33:31,930
What do,
what's your opinion of Russia now for 

1885
01:33:31,930 --> 01:33:32,150
decades?
If you're on the right,

1886
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:35,150
you mistrusted Russia and if you're on 
the left there,

1887
01:33:35,151 --> 01:33:37,070
you know they weren't so bad,
they misunderstood.

1888
01:33:37,340 --> 01:33:42,340
Now it's totally flipped and opinions on
whether you trust Russia just because of

1889
01:33:43,161 --> 01:33:45,020
the influence of Donald trump have 
shifted.

1890
01:33:45,021 --> 01:33:47,960
So the people on the right are more 
sympathetic to Russia.

1891
01:33:48,050 --> 01:33:51,830
Something that would have been almost 
unthinkable even 10 years ago.

1892
01:33:51,950 --> 01:33:56,950
Free Trade is another example.
It was kind of a right wing cars and 

1893
01:33:56,950 --> 01:34:00,710
then trump managed to flip it.
So what it shows is where I'm going with

1894
01:34:00,711 --> 01:34:04,010
this and this is something that I've,
where I've changed my mind.

1895
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:05,750
I used to think they were these 
ideologies,

1896
01:34:05,751 --> 01:34:10,751
kind of like religious catechisms where 
these are the beliefs that follow from 

1897
01:34:11,571 --> 01:34:14,600
one another,
but a lot of us just rot tribalism.

1898
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:15,500
It just like,
you know,

1899
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:18,160
in sports,
the players,

1900
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:23,400
your churn through the tip,
the rosters with free agency and you 

1901
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:23,450
know,
we used to be a guy.

1902
01:34:23,510 --> 01:34:25,250
He's a good guy.
Well that he's on the other team now.

1903
01:34:25,251 --> 01:34:30,251
He's a bad guy.
It was Jerry Seinfeld once said you 

1904
01:34:30,251 --> 01:34:33,040
rooting for clothing and that kind of 
happens with political ideologies as 

1905
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:34,250
well to I think to everyone's shock.

1906
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:36,760
Yeah.
That the tribalism thing is very,

1907
01:34:37,210 --> 01:34:42,210
very confusing to me because you could 
see it like it's such an obvious pattern

1908
01:34:42,430 --> 01:34:44,230
and that when it,
when it plays out,

1909
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:45,780
like,
you know,

1910
01:34:46,090 --> 01:34:51,090
the global warming thing.
I was having a conversation with a guy 

1911
01:34:51,090 --> 01:34:51,340
in my Jujitsu class and I'll never 
forget this.

1912
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:52,850
And he was like,
ah,

1913
01:34:52,851 --> 01:34:53,920
it's been a.
it's a cycle,

1914
01:34:54,190 --> 01:34:59,190
it's a cycle of global warming and 
climate change has always been a cycle 

1915
01:34:59,190 --> 01:35:01,070
and you know the people that say that 
it's not.

1916
01:35:01,071 --> 01:35:01,430
It's like,
oh,

1917
01:35:01,431 --> 01:35:06,431
what will.
How much have you studied other 

1918
01:35:06,431 --> 01:35:06,431
scientists?
Like,

1919
01:35:06,431 --> 01:35:09,290
I don't know a lot about global warming.
I don't know a lot about climate change,

1920
01:35:09,291 --> 01:35:14,060
but I know what I've read and it seems 
to me to be a very complex issue and I'm

1921
01:35:14,061 --> 01:35:18,430
talking to this 25 year old guy who was 
in the military who's telling me this.

1922
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:19,550
I mean,
do you have an education?

1923
01:35:19,551 --> 01:35:20,300
And it's like,
no.

1924
01:35:20,420 --> 01:35:20,780
I'm like,
well,

1925
01:35:20,781 --> 01:35:25,490
why didn't you just automatically like 
decide that this is a more talking about

1926
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:30,520
the very temperature of the planet earth
that's complex and what is causing it?

1927
01:35:31,971 --> 01:35:34,850
Is it a carbon monoxide thing?
Is it a what?

1928
01:35:35,590 --> 01:35:40,590
Why do you just automatically subscribed
to this and it's because that's how his 

1929
01:35:40,821 --> 01:35:45,821
tribe communicates.
This is how his tribe and that it gives 

1930
01:35:45,821 --> 01:35:49,661
people comfort to be in these weird 
little groups where everybody has group 

1931
01:35:49,661 --> 01:35:49,661
think.

1932
01:35:49,661 --> 01:35:50,950
Yeah,
and this is a a,

1933
01:35:51,160 --> 01:35:56,160
a.
I talk about this phenomenon in 

1934
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:56,770
enlightenment now because it's a book 
that argues for,

1935
01:35:57,020 --> 01:35:57,870
uh,
the,

1936
01:35:57,930 --> 01:36:00,400
the importance of reason and,
uh,

1937
01:36:00,401 --> 01:36:05,401
and how there has been progress thanks 
to application of reason and a natural 

1938
01:36:05,401 --> 01:36:07,230
pushback is,
well,

1939
01:36:07,390 --> 01:36:09,340
you look at things like that,
we don't seem so reasonable.

1940
01:36:09,341 --> 01:36:10,870
It's as a species,
how can you,

1941
01:36:11,180 --> 01:36:14,830
what's going on that were gay?
We seem to be getting less reasonable.

1942
01:36:15,130 --> 01:36:18,040
And I think the answer is there's reason
can work in,

1943
01:36:18,370 --> 01:36:23,370
for different goals.
And here I'm using the ideas of a Yale 

1944
01:36:23,370 --> 01:36:26,670
scholar named Dan Dan Daniel Kahan where
he knows there's a perverse way in which

1945
01:36:26,951 --> 01:36:29,980
there's actually is a kind of 
rationality to that kind of belief.

1946
01:36:30,010 --> 01:36:31,660
Namely,
when you vote,

1947
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:37,680
what are the chances that your vote's 
really gonna swing reelection pretty 

1948
01:36:37,680 --> 01:36:38,170
close to zero.
On the other hand,

1949
01:36:38,410 --> 01:36:41,710
when you express an opinion in your,
your peer group,

1950
01:36:41,900 --> 01:36:43,900
the people you work with,
your family,

1951
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:49,080
what are the chances that holding a 
wrong opinion will lead you to be kind 

1952
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:51,490
of condemned and ostracized and treated 
as a real weirdo?

1953
01:36:52,020 --> 01:36:52,930
You know,
very high.

1954
01:36:53,290 --> 01:36:56,980
So if you're,
if everyone thinks what opinion is going

1955
01:36:56,981 --> 01:37:00,340
to help my esteem and the people I care 
about,

1956
01:37:00,850 --> 01:37:05,850
they can latch onto all kinds of beliefs
if they've become kind of identity 

1957
01:37:05,891 --> 01:37:07,960
badges for their tribe.
Uh,

1958
01:37:08,530 --> 01:37:11,260
this is rational in terms of the world 
they live in.

1959
01:37:11,380 --> 01:37:13,480
It's not so rational for the planet as a
whole.

1960
01:37:13,481 --> 01:37:17,710
If people just subscribed to beliefs 
based on tribal loyalty instead of truth

1961
01:37:18,580 --> 01:37:23,580
and the challenges,
how do we align beliefs more with truth 

1962
01:37:23,580 --> 01:37:28,291
and less with tribal loyalty?
Now it's not hopeless because there are 

1963
01:37:28,291 --> 01:37:29,140
a lot of beliefs that people used to 
have that are,

1964
01:37:29,640 --> 01:37:31,300
that have been,
have been overturned.

1965
01:37:31,301 --> 01:37:34,880
People don't believe in Unicorns anymore
or alchemy and fueled.

1966
01:37:34,890 --> 01:37:39,010
People believe in astrology and,
and a lot of scientific issues are.

1967
01:37:39,190 --> 01:37:41,350
There's no controversy.
Do Antibiotics work?

1968
01:37:41,380 --> 01:37:42,190
Yeah,
I mean there's no,

1969
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:47,400
you know,
it doesn't matter whether you're in the 

1970
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:47,400
right or the left.

1971
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:48,940
So part of the challenge is how do we 
get more and more of our beliefs to be,

1972
01:37:49,530 --> 01:37:54,530
to get,
have our social norms be such that if 

1973
01:37:54,530 --> 01:37:55,120
you believe something just because 
you're on the writer on the left,

1974
01:37:55,290 --> 01:38:00,290
then you're an idiot.
But what you should be doing is looking 

1975
01:38:00,290 --> 01:38:00,930
at the best possible study with an open 
mind.

1976
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:06,560
That's what a cool person does and only 
an idiot just parrots the the right wing

1977
01:38:06,751 --> 01:38:09,120
lined.
That's the kind of social change we need

1978
01:38:09,121 --> 01:38:10,400
to aim for.
Ryan,

1979
01:38:10,410 --> 01:38:15,410
just.
I'm almost a shaming of that kind of 

1980
01:38:15,410 --> 01:38:17,811
ignorance.
This is the desire that people have to 

1981
01:38:17,811 --> 01:38:19,610
subscribe to a predetermined pattern of 
thinking and behaving because it's.

1982
01:38:19,611 --> 01:38:21,990
It's comforting.
It's comforting that you know,

1983
01:38:21,991 --> 01:38:26,991
and it also like they know that other 
people on their group will also think 

1984
01:38:26,991 --> 01:38:28,350
like that.
It's like if you're in the right.

1985
01:38:28,380 --> 01:38:30,630
One of the things about you see about 
right wingers,

1986
01:38:30,640 --> 01:38:35,640
it's kind of hilarious.
I was watching this Kyle Kuklinski 

1987
01:38:35,640 --> 01:38:38,460
secular talk podcast where he was 
talking about this,

1988
01:38:39,090 --> 01:38:41,490
these Christians who were talking about 
trump,

1989
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:46,110
and when you are on the right,
you must have a belief in God.

1990
01:38:46,140 --> 01:38:48,960
You just have to,
and when they were talking about trump,

1991
01:38:48,990 --> 01:38:52,470
they were saying,
we're talking about the man that existed

1992
01:38:52,471 --> 01:38:55,050
before he accepted Jesus.
You know,

1993
01:38:55,051 --> 01:38:56,940
I don't have it,
but the guy was literally saying,

1994
01:38:56,941 --> 01:38:58,860
I don't have a past.
Okay,

1995
01:38:58,920 --> 01:39:03,920
how about you?
Because I've accepted Jesus Christ into 

1996
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:03,930
my life and that once you accept Jesus 
Christ,

1997
01:39:04,050 --> 01:39:06,740
like you are now a believer in Christ 
and you're for,

1998
01:39:06,870 --> 01:39:09,360
you're forgiven for all of your past 
sins.

1999
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:11,460
And this is,
this is on the right.

2000
01:39:11,990 --> 01:39:16,950
There's a giant percentage of the people
that are on the right that subscribed to

2001
01:39:16,951 --> 01:39:20,100
I a religious Christian mindset.

2002
01:39:20,490 --> 01:39:25,490
It is fascinating,
especially when it comes to our current 

2003
01:39:25,490 --> 01:39:28,311
president who by any standards is like 
the least Christian leader that we've 

2004
01:39:28,891 --> 01:39:30,840
ever had passed.
He accepted Jesus.

2005
01:39:31,710 --> 01:39:32,940
He doesn't have a past.
Well,

2006
01:39:32,941 --> 01:39:33,720
yeah,
but he's still,

2007
01:39:33,730 --> 01:39:38,730
you know,
the Christian virtues include things 

2008
01:39:38,730 --> 01:39:39,510
like modesty for the week.
Sure.

2009
01:39:39,560 --> 01:39:43,930
A temperance.
Chivalry Gentlemen leanness and this guy

2010
01:39:43,931 --> 01:39:48,931
is lewd and vainglorious and arrogant 
and contemptuous for for losers,

2011
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:50,520
but which shows,
again,

2012
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:55,680
kind of going back to our discussion,
it's just amazing how much loyalty 

2013
01:39:55,680 --> 01:39:57,810
doesn't have to do with the actual 
content of the beliefs.

2014
01:39:58,140 --> 01:40:03,140
It's just whoever's on on my side,
and of course he promised a lot of perks

2015
01:40:04,500 --> 01:40:06,900
for the,
for the religious right,

2016
01:40:06,901 --> 01:40:11,901
like the repeal of the amendment that a 
tax exempt organizations can't engage in

2017
01:40:12,120 --> 01:40:15,360
politics and lobbying the so called the 
Johnson amendment,

2018
01:40:15,630 --> 01:40:18,960
which meant that if you're a church,
if you don't pay taxes,

2019
01:40:19,170 --> 01:40:20,910
you can't be politically active.

2020
01:40:20,940 --> 01:40:22,560
Well,
they didn't like that and he promised to

2021
01:40:22,561 --> 01:40:27,561
repeal that amendment and so he got 
their loyalty and so it was just raw 

2022
01:40:27,561 --> 01:40:30,330
political muscle kind of overcame 
Christian virtue.

2023
01:40:30,780 --> 01:40:32,520
So bizarre.
So bizarre.

2024
01:40:32,580 --> 01:40:33,540
Yeah,
but it's,

2025
01:40:33,541 --> 01:40:36,330
it's fascinating to watch just these 
patterns,

2026
01:40:36,331 --> 01:40:41,331
these tribal ideological patterns when 
you see these groups that have this sort

2027
01:40:41,731 --> 01:40:46,280
of one mindset and this very clear.
The thing is I can flip another example.

2028
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:49,410
People forget this is so take 
environmentalist them,

2029
01:40:49,550 --> 01:40:51,000
you know,
kind of quintessential,

2030
01:40:51,130 --> 01:40:52,970
you know,
left green cars.

2031
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:58,680
Not so long ago,
it was the other way around is actually 

2032
01:40:58,680 --> 01:40:59,050
considered to be a cause of the right.
Why?

2033
01:40:59,290 --> 01:41:00,270
Well,
if you are,

2034
01:41:00,310 --> 01:41:03,040
if you're a left wing activist in the 
sixties,

2035
01:41:03,041 --> 01:41:04,270
he would say,
well,

2036
01:41:04,420 --> 01:41:09,420
the only people concerned with the 
environment are rich people who liked 

2037
01:41:09,420 --> 01:41:12,691
the view from their country estates and 
they don't want them to be spoiled by 

2038
01:41:12,691 --> 01:41:13,960
being cut down for apartments,
for poor people,

2039
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:15,510
uh,
or they're,

2040
01:41:15,511 --> 01:41:20,511
you know,
duck hunters who want to be able to go 

2041
01:41:20,511 --> 01:41:20,800
and hunt ducks and,
and if you're really socially concerned,

2042
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:25,920
you should care about Vietnam and racism
and poverty and it's just a luxury to 

2043
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:26,460
worry about,
you know,

2044
01:41:26,510 --> 01:41:31,510
trees and flowers and ducks that I 
flipped and then environmentalist and 

2045
01:41:31,511 --> 01:41:33,220
became a leftwing cause.

2046
01:41:33,550 --> 01:41:34,630
But it,
these,

2047
01:41:34,750 --> 01:41:37,900
uh,
these connections between your coalition

2048
01:41:37,901 --> 01:41:41,650
and your beliefs aren't set in stone.
Yeah.

2049
01:41:41,651 --> 01:41:46,390
It wasn't at the beginning of the 
forming of the political parties.

2050
01:41:46,930 --> 01:41:51,930
It was.
The Democrats were very different and 

2051
01:41:51,930 --> 01:41:51,930
Republicans are more like Democrats.
Oh yeah.

2052
01:41:51,930 --> 01:41:53,230
Well,
starting with Abraham Lincoln,

2053
01:41:53,231 --> 01:41:55,240
the first republican president and they 
were the,

2054
01:41:55,250 --> 01:41:55,590
the,
the,

2055
01:41:55,660 --> 01:41:57,610
of course they were the party against 
slavery.

2056
01:41:57,880 --> 01:42:00,220
And in fact,
even in my lifetime,

2057
01:42:00,490 --> 01:42:02,800
through the sixties,
in the south,

2058
01:42:02,830 --> 01:42:07,370
the Democrats were the right wing racist
party.

2059
01:42:07,380 --> 01:42:08,650
I mean,
had George Wallace,

2060
01:42:09,100 --> 01:42:11,770
the governor of Alabama who said 
segregation now,

2061
01:42:11,771 --> 01:42:13,840
segregation forever.
He was a democrat.

2062
01:42:14,170 --> 01:42:16,000
He formed his own party in [inaudible],
68.

2063
01:42:16,290 --> 01:42:20,140
Then back in [inaudible] 72,
he ran for the Democratic nomination.

2064
01:42:20,510 --> 01:42:24,280
And the southern Democrats were they the
kind of the right wingers.

2065
01:42:24,340 --> 01:42:28,000
And it was often the northeast 
Republicans who were the liberals.

2066
01:42:28,180 --> 01:42:30,130
That's still partly true in 
Massachusetts.

2067
01:42:30,280 --> 01:42:32,080
We had a little bit of a remnant of 
that.

2068
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:35,320
We've had some liberal Republican 
governors.

2069
01:42:35,321 --> 01:42:40,321
We have one right now.
Charlie Baker was a Republican and he's 

2070
01:42:40,321 --> 01:42:41,440
pretty moderate middle of the road,
uh,

2071
01:42:41,441 --> 01:42:46,441
William Weld,
who was then the libertarian vice 

2072
01:42:46,441 --> 01:42:46,690
presidential candidate.
He was a republican even,

2073
01:42:46,691 --> 01:42:48,610
you know,
even when Mitt Romney was our governor,

2074
01:42:49,150 --> 01:42:51,940
he was not particularly conservative.
He was a republican.

2075
01:42:52,150 --> 01:42:54,670
So there's the remnants of that in 
Massachusetts.

2076
01:42:54,790 --> 01:42:59,790
They used to be a little bit of that in 
New York where they were liberal 

2077
01:42:59,790 --> 01:42:59,790
Republicans.
Uh,

2078
01:42:59,790 --> 01:43:01,690
but yeah,
that's a case where it's flipped and now

2079
01:43:01,720 --> 01:43:04,270
democratic was left of center 
Republican,

2080
01:43:04,271 --> 01:43:04,870
right,
of center.

2081
01:43:05,110 --> 01:43:10,110
Yeah.
You've seen some of that also with some 

2082
01:43:10,110 --> 01:43:10,480
rub.
Republicans have tried to disingenuously

2083
01:43:10,481 --> 01:43:14,620
connect the Democratic Party with the 
KKK because of the past.

2084
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:15,760
Well,
and that was true.

2085
01:43:15,790 --> 01:43:17,680
That was true.
But you know,

2086
01:43:17,681 --> 01:43:19,640
they're talking about the people in the 
present that,

2087
01:43:20,250 --> 01:43:25,250
you know,
this is the party of the support of the 

2088
01:43:25,250 --> 01:43:25,250
KKK.
Well,

2089
01:43:25,250 --> 01:43:25,250
sorta.
Yeah,

2090
01:43:25,250 --> 01:43:27,250
that means that all the time ago,
that was the end.

2091
01:43:28,060 --> 01:43:29,200
Yeah.
Different people.

2092
01:43:29,500 --> 01:43:30,460
Yeah.
It's um,

2093
01:43:30,520 --> 01:43:35,240
it's just fascinating to me to watch 
these groups of people and uh,

2094
01:43:35,290 --> 01:43:36,630
you know,
we've talked about um,

2095
01:43:37,210 --> 01:43:39,610
political parties,
the right versus the left.

2096
01:43:39,611 --> 01:43:44,611
It's always weird to me that there are 
these two sides and that people sort of 

2097
01:43:44,611 --> 01:43:49,420
like take comfort and in choosing this 
group that they identify with these

2098
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:53,420
issues where,
you know,

2099
01:43:53,421 --> 01:43:57,920
I identify as a right wing,
I identify as a left identify as this,

2100
01:43:58,190 --> 01:44:03,190
that these,
these things are very rigid in their 

2101
01:44:03,190 --> 01:44:05,480
structure and they don't allow for 
nuance thinking and they don't allow for

2102
01:44:05,690 --> 01:44:09,620
being objective about issues.
And considering the other side,

2103
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:14,800
considering other people's points of 
view and the way they're looking at 

2104
01:44:14,901 --> 01:44:17,750
things and thinking of maybe there's 
some common ground

2105
01:44:18,740 --> 01:44:19,770
I agree,
and in fact,

2106
01:44:19,790 --> 01:44:23,630
in,
in like mit now has the subtitle,

2107
01:44:23,870 --> 01:44:28,020
the case for reasons science humanism 
and progress.

2108
01:44:28,240 --> 01:44:33,240
And so I have a chapter on reason.
I had a chapter on and I have a chapter 

2109
01:44:33,240 --> 01:44:33,810
on humanism,
but in the chapter on reason,

2110
01:44:34,170 --> 01:44:39,170
I asked the question why does it?
On the one hand it appears that we're 

2111
01:44:39,170 --> 01:44:42,801
getting smarter.
There's the flynn effect of rising Iq 

2112
01:44:42,801 --> 01:44:45,321
scores and there are a lot of areas in 
life where what you see just much more 

2113
01:44:45,321 --> 01:44:46,410
intelligence being applied in just a few
years ago.

2114
01:44:46,500 --> 01:44:47,960
So just for example,
uh,

2115
01:44:48,180 --> 01:44:50,100
you know,
moving in evidence based medicine,

2116
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:55,400
a lot of what your doctor does,
it's just based on kind of superstition 

2117
01:44:55,400 --> 01:44:56,220
and tradition.
And now people are saying,

2118
01:44:56,221 --> 01:44:56,630
well,
let's,

2119
01:44:56,810 --> 01:44:59,400
you know,
let's do a randomized controlled trial,

2120
01:44:59,401 --> 01:45:00,780
see what works,
what doesn't.

2121
01:45:01,290 --> 01:45:04,290
So is getting smarter.
You look at policing,

2122
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:08,310
one of the reasons that the crime rate 
has gone down so much,

2123
01:45:08,390 --> 01:45:10,610
uh,
another positive development that I,

2124
01:45:10,611 --> 01:45:14,700
I talk about that people aren't aware of
is that policing has gotten smarter.

2125
01:45:14,850 --> 01:45:16,830
They everyday,
especially in New York,

2126
01:45:17,070 --> 01:45:19,500
they would gather data as to where the 
homicides were,

2127
01:45:19,530 --> 01:45:22,650
which neighborhoods,
which blocks and which neighborhoods and

2128
01:45:22,651 --> 01:45:24,540
they would concentrate the police 
forces,

2129
01:45:24,950 --> 01:45:29,950
you know,
on that day and to prevent things from 

2130
01:45:29,950 --> 01:45:30,690
getting out of control with cycles of 
revenge.

2131
01:45:30,970 --> 01:45:35,970
You at sports know moneyball,
where you've got kind of smarter teams 

2132
01:45:35,970 --> 01:45:36,540
that can beat,
reached Richard Teams.

2133
01:45:37,020 --> 01:45:40,560
You look at policy and you've got 
evidenced based policy.

2134
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:43,980
So all these areas where it looks like 
the country's getting smarter,

2135
01:45:44,130 --> 01:45:49,130
but then there are all these areas we're
looking at Kennedy's getting lots of 

2136
01:45:49,130 --> 01:45:51,351
Jupiter and a lot of them are,
I argue cases where people were issues 

2137
01:45:52,021 --> 01:45:56,190
get politicized and then people just go 
with their own coalition.

2138
01:45:56,700 --> 01:46:01,700
And the ideal would be,
and this is an ideal that's in least 

2139
01:46:01,700 --> 01:46:03,810
preached in science and to some extent 
practice,

2140
01:46:03,811 --> 01:46:05,460
you know,
there's not leftwing science and writing

2141
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:06,150
science.

2142
01:46:06,450 --> 01:46:11,450
It's what are the data?
What did the data say if you haven't 

2143
01:46:11,450 --> 01:46:11,450
seen,
let's do an experiment.

2144
01:46:11,450 --> 01:46:11,730
Let's see who's right,
who's wrong,

2145
01:46:11,910 --> 01:46:16,910
and either side might be embarrassed and
I think in the case of these great 

2146
01:46:16,910 --> 01:46:20,870
political and economic issues we've got,
we'd be better off if we thought like 

2147
01:46:20,911 --> 01:46:24,090
scientists kept an open mind and say,
well,

2148
01:46:24,091 --> 01:46:29,091
what works?
There's a minimum wage lead to a higher 

2149
01:46:29,091 --> 01:46:30,870
unemployment because labor becomes more 
expensive.

2150
01:46:31,110 --> 01:46:32,060
Well,
maybe,

2151
01:46:32,061 --> 01:46:33,420
you know,
beats me if I know.

2152
01:46:33,421 --> 01:46:35,460
Let's let look at areas that have tried 
it.

2153
01:46:35,480 --> 01:46:37,170
See what happens.
Uh,

2154
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:38,790
do,
does too much welfare.

2155
01:46:38,791 --> 01:46:39,930
Make people,
you know,

2156
01:46:39,931 --> 01:46:41,250
unambitious and Lacey.
Well,

2157
01:46:41,251 --> 01:46:41,730
uh,
you know,

2158
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:44,040
I can't figure this out from my arm 
chair,

2159
01:46:44,160 --> 01:46:46,410
but let's look at different.
Compare.

2160
01:46:46,411 --> 01:46:50,370
Different countries compare different 
states and cities issue after issue.

2161
01:46:50,371 --> 01:46:53,700
I think we need to be much more 
pragmatic and open to evidence,

2162
01:46:53,950 --> 01:46:57,220
but when you do deal with these issues,
much like you were talking about,

2163
01:46:57,221 --> 01:47:01,270
the difference between genders,
when you deal with the actual raw data,

2164
01:47:01,540 --> 01:47:06,540
that raw data,
a lot of it gets very problematic for 

2165
01:47:06,540 --> 01:47:08,860
people that hold these ideas very 
rigidly in their mind.

2166
01:47:09,310 --> 01:47:14,310
And they don't,
they don't want to accept certain facts 

2167
01:47:14,310 --> 01:47:17,281
and Statistics and they come up with 
reasons why these things are either 

2168
01:47:17,281 --> 01:47:20,920
inaccurate or biased or racist or sexist
or what have you.

2169
01:47:21,050 --> 01:47:21,620
Yeah,
no,

2170
01:47:21,630 --> 01:47:23,450
that's really true because I think 
we're,

2171
01:47:24,430 --> 01:47:29,430
I think evolution didn't make us into a 
intuitive scientists so much as a tool 

2172
01:47:29,781 --> 01:47:32,600
intuitive lawyers and preachers.
So we,

2173
01:47:32,750 --> 01:47:37,750
the natural tendency is to amass the 
strongest possible case for your own 

2174
01:47:37,851 --> 01:47:42,050
side and to a boast that you,
the,

2175
01:47:42,100 --> 01:47:47,100
you are the side of virtue.
The people who disagree with you are 

2176
01:47:47,100 --> 01:47:47,100
idiots.
And,

2177
01:47:47,100 --> 01:47:47,750
and,
and,

2178
01:47:47,810 --> 01:47:48,620
uh,
evil.

2179
01:47:48,930 --> 01:47:53,930
Uh,
and we got to push back against that 

2180
01:47:53,930 --> 01:47:53,930
tendency.
I,

2181
01:47:53,930 --> 01:47:54,590
I argued with enlightenment now.

2182
01:47:54,950 --> 01:47:55,510
Yeah.
I just,

2183
01:47:55,580 --> 01:47:58,490
I try to recognize that in my own mind 
when it comes up.

2184
01:47:58,491 --> 01:48:02,510
But it's,
it's so incredibly common that tribalism

2185
01:48:02,780 --> 01:48:05,840
that we see on the right and the left,
we see it.

2186
01:48:05,841 --> 01:48:10,841
Men versus women.
We oftentimes see it even in gay versus 

2187
01:48:10,841 --> 01:48:10,841
straight.
It's,

2188
01:48:10,841 --> 01:48:15,251
it's,
it's a very bizarre but incredibly 

2189
01:48:15,251 --> 01:48:17,000
common aspect of being a human being.

2190
01:48:17,250 --> 01:48:20,410
It really is.
And I started out as a,

2191
01:48:20,490 --> 01:48:23,760
as a psychologist,
a clinical psychologist.

2192
01:48:23,761 --> 01:48:25,710
I don't see patients but on the 
cognitive scientists,

2193
01:48:25,711 --> 01:48:30,711
so I'm interested in how the mind works 
and so a lot of my ideas on which way 

2194
01:48:31,261 --> 01:48:36,261
we're going to keep going in a positive 
direction are influenced by a kind of a 

2195
01:48:36,261 --> 01:48:41,121
recognition of what makes us tick and 
what are the pitfalls in having a human 

2196
01:48:41,581 --> 01:48:42,840
brain.
And I mean,

2197
01:48:42,841 --> 01:48:44,100
I,
I don't take credit for this.

2198
01:48:44,101 --> 01:48:46,530
This goes back to,
for example,

2199
01:48:46,531 --> 01:48:48,220
the American,
uh,

2200
01:48:48,300 --> 01:48:53,300
founders and framers,
Madison and Jefferson and Adams and 

2201
01:48:53,300 --> 01:48:55,380
Hamilton,
when they were arguing,

2202
01:48:55,381 --> 01:49:00,381
well,
how should we set up this new new 

2203
01:49:00,381 --> 01:49:00,381
country,
this new government?

2204
01:49:00,381 --> 01:49:03,800
They will kind of intuitive 
psychologists and they would point it 

2205
01:49:03,800 --> 01:49:03,800
out that,
well,

2206
01:49:03,800 --> 01:49:08,151
if you just empower a leader,
he's going to get drunk with his own 

2207
01:49:08,151 --> 01:49:10,320
power and he's going to be diluted.
And what do we do about that?

2208
01:49:10,321 --> 01:49:12,060
Because we do need some kind of leader.
Well,

2209
01:49:12,090 --> 01:49:15,000
you've got these checks and balances.
How do,

2210
01:49:15,030 --> 01:49:16,250
what makes people better off?
They,

2211
01:49:16,390 --> 01:49:21,390
if they can exchange things and each one
produces something they're good at and 

2212
01:49:21,901 --> 01:49:24,120
trades it with something that someone 
else produces.

2213
01:49:24,330 --> 01:49:29,330
How do we set up a country where it 
takes advantage of people's tendency to 

2214
01:49:29,330 --> 01:49:33,381
treat things,
so the connection between politics and 

2215
01:49:33,381 --> 01:49:34,020
psychology was has been there for a long
time.

2216
01:49:34,740 --> 01:49:35,380
Now.
The,

2217
01:49:35,390 --> 01:49:35,710
the,

2218
01:49:36,040 --> 01:49:41,040
the subject enlightenment.
That's a very loaded subject because it 

2219
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:41,040
is.
Yeah,

2220
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:45,911
and especially in the world of Weirdos 
and cult leaders,

2221
01:49:47,590 --> 01:49:51,920
Charlotte Tins and people that are sort 
of promoting this idea,

2222
01:49:52,400 --> 01:49:57,400
this idea that you can achieve this sort
of zen state of bliss,

2223
01:49:59,511 --> 01:50:01,400
of being above it.
All of being,

2224
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:04,970
you know,
wise to the point of being a sage.

2225
01:50:05,660 --> 01:50:08,480
That's a.
that's a weird concept,

2226
01:50:08,481 --> 01:50:09,810
isn't it?
In today's Day and age,

2227
01:50:09,960 --> 01:50:10,410
my

2228
01:50:10,410 --> 01:50:15,410
editor actually,
it was a little nervous about my choice 

2229
01:50:15,410 --> 01:50:15,960
of title.
I went through a bunch of titles for it.

2230
01:50:15,961 --> 01:50:17,430
As I was writing it,
he said,

2231
01:50:17,431 --> 01:50:22,431
well,
don't you think people are going to 

2232
01:50:22,431 --> 01:50:23,451
confuse it with you?
And so the reason that meaning for 

2233
01:50:25,081 --> 01:50:27,870
enlightenment,
the other meeting that I had in mind was

2234
01:50:27,871 --> 01:50:32,871
the movement in the 18th century to 
apply reason to human betterment.

2235
01:50:35,370 --> 01:50:40,370
The ideas of of hume and Adam Smith and 
the American founders like Jefferson and

2236
01:50:42,181 --> 01:50:47,181
Madison and John Locke and Thomas Hobbes
and the 17th and 18th century,

2237
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:49,710
and we said,
look,

2238
01:50:49,711 --> 01:50:54,711
if you know,
if some people are confused and they 

2239
01:50:54,711 --> 01:50:56,451
think this is a path toward my book is 
going to be a path towards spiritual 

2240
01:50:56,451 --> 01:50:56,451
enlightenment.
Well,

2241
01:50:56,451 --> 01:50:58,560
let them buy the book.
They might enjoy it anyway,

2242
01:50:59,070 --> 01:51:04,070
but I went to the dictionary to see 
which of the two meetings was listed 

2243
01:51:04,070 --> 01:51:05,490
first and most of the dictionary is 
listed.

2244
01:51:05,491 --> 01:51:10,491
The sense that I had in mind first,
namely the movement in the 18th century 

2245
01:51:10,491 --> 01:51:11,520
toward greater reason is the spiritual 
distinction,

2246
01:51:11,521 --> 01:51:16,521
right?
Spiritual enlightenment is the one that 

2247
01:51:16,521 --> 01:51:16,521
people.
That's right.

2248
01:51:16,521 --> 01:51:17,160
And that's to be perfectly honest,
that's not what the book is about.

2249
01:51:17,590 --> 01:51:18,900
Uh,
but you know,

2250
01:51:18,930 --> 01:51:20,280
well,
some people think it has made it.

2251
01:51:20,281 --> 01:51:22,820
They'll buy the book by accident.
Do you meditate?

2252
01:51:23,470 --> 01:51:24,180
You know,
I don't,

2253
01:51:24,181 --> 01:51:24,990
but I think I should.

2254
01:51:27,890 --> 01:51:29,930
But you're such a smart guy.
Like why would you,

2255
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:34,230
why would there be anything that I think
you should do that you don't do it?

2256
01:51:34,280 --> 01:51:37,060
It's a really good question because I'm 
not clearly,

2257
01:51:37,130 --> 01:51:40,050
I'm not that smart.
It's not bad.

2258
01:51:40,051 --> 01:51:42,720
It's just a matter of like a practice 
and,

2259
01:51:42,760 --> 01:51:44,670
you know,
I think so.

2260
01:51:44,671 --> 01:51:45,270
Yeah.
And I did,

2261
01:51:45,300 --> 01:51:46,540
uh,
I was in a,

2262
01:51:46,990 --> 01:51:47,640
uh,
in,

2263
01:51:47,650 --> 01:51:51,580
in Davos the week before last and was on
a panel with a maturity cow.

2264
01:51:51,720 --> 01:51:56,720
The French Buddhist monk who's a,
who I see eye to eye with an a lot of 

2265
01:51:56,850 --> 01:52:01,850
matters.
He wrote the forward to the French 

2266
01:52:01,850 --> 01:52:01,850
translation to the better angels of our 
nature and he had it.

2267
01:52:01,850 --> 01:52:04,440
He had me in the whole room meditating 
and it was,

2268
01:52:04,540 --> 01:52:09,540
yeah,
I mean I liked it and I probably should 

2269
01:52:09,540 --> 01:52:09,680
do some orange.
It's probably a benefit to it for now.

2270
01:52:10,410 --> 01:52:15,140
Do you have any practices that you do do
to try to sorta like keep your,

2271
01:52:15,240 --> 01:52:16,200
your mind clean?

2272
01:52:16,200 --> 01:52:21,200
Like do you exercise regularly?
I definitely exercise regularly and I'm 

2273
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:23,720
a,
I like exercise my,

2274
01:52:23,990 --> 01:52:26,610
where the scenery goes by,
so I don't,

2275
01:52:26,670 --> 01:52:29,250
I tend not to hang around in gyms,
but I like jogging,

2276
01:52:29,251 --> 01:52:30,600
cycling,
hiking,

2277
01:52:30,601 --> 01:52:31,610
kayaking.
Uh,

2278
01:52:31,680 --> 01:52:36,680
I like a outdoor exercise and more 
aerobic than a um,

2279
01:52:38,180 --> 01:52:38,610
than,
than,

2280
01:52:38,640 --> 01:52:39,900
than bodybuilding.
Yeah,

2281
01:52:39,901 --> 01:52:43,140
they say that's one of the best things 
for a cognitive function,

2282
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:48,200
a high intensity aerobic exercise that I
like to think that,

2283
01:52:48,710 --> 01:52:50,310
and I try to,
uh,

2284
01:52:50,360 --> 01:52:55,360
you know,
sort of step back and exert some 

2285
01:52:55,360 --> 01:52:58,691
discipline on this.
So social media email more,

2286
01:52:59,960 --> 01:53:02,210
more than social media is trying to 
spend time with,

2287
01:53:02,300 --> 01:53:04,220
uh,
with my wife,

2288
01:53:04,260 --> 01:53:09,260
Rebecca Goldstein of novelist and 
philosopher and we have a lot in common 

2289
01:53:09,260 --> 01:53:10,460
and it'd be kind of wasting life if I 
didn't get to,

2290
01:53:10,850 --> 01:53:11,750
uh,
you know,

2291
01:53:11,751 --> 01:53:16,751
enjoy,
enjoy time with her and she feels the 

2292
01:53:16,751 --> 01:53:16,751
same way.

2293
01:53:16,751 --> 01:53:17,780
She's also a workaholic.
So we both are conscious of,

2294
01:53:18,010 --> 01:53:18,490
you know,
let's,

2295
01:53:18,550 --> 01:53:19,880
let's get,
go for a walk.

2296
01:53:20,150 --> 01:53:20,830
Uh,
you know,

2297
01:53:21,210 --> 01:53:21,730
let,
let,

2298
01:53:21,950 --> 01:53:23,060
let's see,
see some friends.

2299
01:53:23,061 --> 01:53:27,710
Let's be close to our families.
Do you have a goal when you're writing a

2300
01:53:27,711 --> 01:53:31,820
book like this or is it just you,
you have an interesting subject and just

2301
01:53:31,821 --> 01:53:36,821
sort of follow it through?
I always begin a book when I have,

2302
01:53:37,400 --> 01:53:41,000
when I come across some really deep,
exciting,

2303
01:53:41,001 --> 01:53:46,001
interesting idea that I think has not 
been made public enough.

2304
01:53:47,120 --> 01:53:49,580
Uh,
so in the case of,

2305
01:53:49,610 --> 01:53:50,360
of,
uh,

2306
01:53:50,361 --> 01:53:54,350
the better angels of our nature,
it was the fact that all these measures,

2307
01:53:54,351 --> 01:53:58,820
violence has been in historical decline 
and this is like a mind blowing fact.

2308
01:53:58,850 --> 01:54:02,450
And I came across it by various 
historians,

2309
01:54:02,451 --> 01:54:07,451
political scientists,
psychologists that have sent me their 

2310
01:54:07,451 --> 01:54:09,611
data and I was of sitting on all these 
graphs showing the we're getting less 

2311
01:54:09,611 --> 01:54:10,160
violent and know,
know about it.

2312
01:54:10,580 --> 01:54:15,580
So I wanted to,
I thought I had an important story to 

2313
01:54:15,580 --> 01:54:16,790
tell and I had a big intellectual 
challenge.

2314
01:54:16,791 --> 01:54:17,630
Namely,
here I am,

2315
01:54:17,631 --> 01:54:18,690
a psychologist.
I,

2316
01:54:18,691 --> 01:54:23,691
I,
I like to think I understand how the 

2317
01:54:23,691 --> 01:54:23,691
mind works,
but it's a big puzzle.

2318
01:54:23,691 --> 01:54:26,840
Why were our ancestors so violent and 
how come more or less violent?

2319
01:54:26,870 --> 01:54:29,870
We're kind of the same animals that we 
were a couple of hundred years ago.

2320
01:54:30,250 --> 01:54:32,480
And likewise with the new book with 
enlightenment now,

2321
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:37,960
then I discovered that there was even 
more good news that if you look at other

2322
01:54:37,971 --> 01:54:40,670
measures of human wellbeing like 
poverty,

2323
01:54:40,700 --> 01:54:42,320
like illiteracy,
like,

2324
01:54:42,330 --> 01:54:44,570
um,
number of work hours,

2325
01:54:45,010 --> 01:54:46,280
uh,
like disease,

2326
01:54:46,730 --> 01:54:50,630
a graph after graph looks like we've 
made improvements,

2327
01:54:50,870 --> 01:54:52,580
car safety,
plane safety,

2328
01:54:52,640 --> 01:54:54,800
workplace safety,
pedestrian safety,

2329
01:54:55,250 --> 01:54:57,890
death by fire,
death by drowning.

2330
01:54:58,090 --> 01:55:02,390
Almost all of them are going down.
And so that was a story that I thought I

2331
01:55:02,391 --> 01:55:04,620
was excited by it because,
uh,

2332
01:55:04,940 --> 01:55:05,660
uh,
I,

2333
01:55:05,720 --> 01:55:10,720
I knew that when people came across it,
they would find it interesting and it 

2334
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:11,750
was again,
an intellectual challenge.

2335
01:55:11,900 --> 01:55:14,780
How do you explain it?
And I attributed it to the enlightenment

2336
01:55:14,781 --> 01:55:17,540
ideas.
Do you encounter much resistance to this

2337
01:55:17,600 --> 01:55:20,210
narrative from bloom people?
Oh,

2338
01:55:20,211 --> 01:55:21,260
you bet.
Yeah.

2339
01:55:21,280 --> 01:55:22,580
You know,
and there are things that,

2340
01:55:22,870 --> 01:55:27,260
that go wrong here.
There's the opioid epidemic that's wrong

2341
01:55:27,261 --> 01:55:29,900
direction.
There's their big threats.

2342
01:55:30,120 --> 01:55:32,810
There's always a possibility of nuclear 
war.

2343
01:55:32,811 --> 01:55:36,350
And we've got to be really careful not 
to do anything stupid and to,

2344
01:55:36,980 --> 01:55:41,030
in fact try to world walk the world back
from nuclear weapons in the future.

2345
01:55:41,090 --> 01:55:42,960
And climate change,
um,

2346
01:55:44,190 --> 01:55:45,660
and then there's some people who just 
don't believe it.

2347
01:55:45,690 --> 01:55:46,080
They said,
well,

2348
01:55:46,081 --> 01:55:48,510
what about that?
The terrorist attack yesterday?

2349
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:49,740
And I just say,
well,

2350
01:55:49,741 --> 01:55:50,730
you know,
terrorism,

2351
01:55:51,180 --> 01:55:56,180
they're kind of jerking us around the 
terrorists by doing an eensy weensy bit 

2352
01:55:56,180 --> 01:55:58,080
of violence.
That gets a huge amount of publicity.

2353
01:55:58,350 --> 01:56:03,350
So let's not let ourselves get jerked 
around by terrorists and rampage 

2354
01:56:03,350 --> 01:56:03,350
shooters.

2355
01:56:03,350 --> 01:56:07,820
Not give them so much publicity 
concentrate on where the deaths really 

2356
01:56:07,820 --> 01:56:08,850
are.
Like in car accidents,

2357
01:56:08,851 --> 01:56:12,150
like in ordinary homicides,
like in opioid deaths.

2358
01:56:12,180 --> 01:56:16,200
Let's look at the numbers and not get 
fooled by the headlines.

2359
01:56:17,100 --> 01:56:18,240
But yeah,
I do get resistance.

2360
01:56:18,270 --> 01:56:23,270
We have obviously we have a massive 
reaction to any mass tragedy like a,

2361
01:56:24,290 --> 01:56:26,010
a mass shooting or something along those
lines,

2362
01:56:26,011 --> 01:56:29,190
but that this is a natural thing,
right?

2363
01:56:29,191 --> 01:56:32,730
Because this just seems so strange that 
it could occur.

2364
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:36,420
It's a natural thing to have this 
reaction to this horrible tragedy,

2365
01:56:36,421 --> 01:56:38,970
but we don't have a reaction to,
you know,

2366
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,850
how many thousands of people die every 
day because of obesity.

2367
01:56:42,330 --> 01:56:44,280
Obesity.
Exactly.

2368
01:56:44,370 --> 01:56:48,000
Or even if we concentrate on violence,
we forget about,

2369
01:56:48,260 --> 01:56:50,960
you know,
the guy who shoots his wife because he,

2370
01:56:51,050 --> 01:56:56,050
he,
he thinks she's been flirting too much 

2371
01:56:56,050 --> 01:56:58,581
or the two guys who have a fight in a 
bar over who gets to use the pool table 

2372
01:56:58,581 --> 01:57:00,810
next and one of them is,
is lying dead on the floor.

2373
01:57:01,020 --> 01:57:02,670
Uh,
and these are,

2374
01:57:02,700 --> 01:57:04,820
there are far more,
uh,

2375
01:57:04,890 --> 01:57:08,880
murders of that kind.
Then there are terrorists killings every

2376
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:11,250
day.
There are something like 25 of those,

2377
01:57:11,270 --> 01:57:16,270
those homicides and uh,
so it's like a sandy hill massacred day 

2378
01:57:16,270 --> 01:57:17,610
after day,
after day after day.

2379
01:57:17,670 --> 01:57:20,160
And they don't make the headlines 
because they occur,

2380
01:57:20,370 --> 01:57:22,020
you know,
bit by bit here and there.

2381
01:57:22,530 --> 01:57:27,530
But it's still incredibly confusing to 
people when someone does do something 

2382
01:57:27,530 --> 01:57:27,530
like the vegas shooting,
like what,

2383
01:57:27,530 --> 01:57:32,390
what is this like?
So I have a discussion of that just 

2384
01:57:32,390 --> 01:57:35,181
because it is such a puzzle and because 
it attracts so much attention and a lot 

2385
01:57:35,181 --> 01:57:38,610
of it is just the notoriety.
These are often,

2386
01:57:38,820 --> 01:57:43,820
not always,
but they're often kind of nobody's and 

2387
01:57:43,820 --> 01:57:46,761
their life has gone,
going down the toilet and they're 

2388
01:57:46,761 --> 01:57:46,830
thinking,
well,

2389
01:57:46,831 --> 01:57:49,230
how can I do something that makes my 
life meaningful,

2390
01:57:49,310 --> 01:57:50,730
go out in a blaze of glory?

2391
01:57:51,240 --> 01:57:53,070
And so they think,
what is the.

2392
01:57:53,100 --> 01:57:54,210
In fact,
I would ask you this question.

2393
01:57:54,211 --> 01:57:55,890
Let's say you want to become,
no,

2394
01:57:55,920 --> 01:57:57,180
not you,
you're already famous,

2395
01:57:57,390 --> 01:58:02,390
but if I say to a typical person,
what is the one thing you can do that's 

2396
01:58:02,970 --> 01:58:05,430
guaranteed to make you famous by 
tomorrow?

2397
01:58:05,880 --> 01:58:07,650
The answer is kill a bunch of innocent 
people.

2398
01:58:08,190 --> 01:58:09,330
And uh,
you know,

2399
01:58:09,331 --> 01:58:10,100
that's just a,
a,

2400
01:58:10,101 --> 01:58:15,101
a perverse fact about the world.
And so for people where fame and meaning

2401
01:58:15,780 --> 01:58:19,710
and mattering are more important than 
anything including life itself,

2402
01:58:20,280 --> 01:58:24,690
we've kind of given this perverse 
opportunity to become a somebody,

2403
01:58:25,110 --> 01:58:29,760
but because we just give them wall to 
wall news coverage.

2404
01:58:30,210 --> 01:58:32,730
That's fascinating.
Has there been an uptick in,

2405
01:58:33,180 --> 01:58:38,180
in mass shootings and these sort of 
tragedies along with social media and 

2406
01:58:38,700 --> 01:58:42,550
more media in general?
Probably a sum.

2407
01:58:42,551 --> 01:58:46,190
And they do tend to be occurring in,
in cycles there.

2408
01:58:46,190 --> 01:58:48,090
There's a copycat phenomenon.
Yeah.

2409
01:58:48,370 --> 01:58:51,490
Until people get a little bit bored and 
then it kind of dies down again.

2410
01:58:51,940 --> 01:58:55,390
So there is that.
And so there is a suggested policy.

2411
01:58:55,710 --> 01:59:00,710
Uh,
I actually signed onto this from some 

2412
01:59:00,710 --> 01:59:02,880
criminologists that the news media 
should not publish the names or the 

2413
01:59:03,371 --> 01:59:06,790
faces of mass killers,
uh,

2414
01:59:07,210 --> 01:59:08,080
that,
uh,

2415
01:59:08,350 --> 01:59:10,570
what's news?
It may be newsworthy that had happened,

2416
01:59:10,600 --> 01:59:12,690
but the particular name of the guy,
wife,

2417
01:59:12,730 --> 01:59:15,940
why is that newsworthy?
The problem is it gets clicks.

2418
01:59:16,140 --> 01:59:17,190
It gets click.
You're right.

2419
01:59:17,800 --> 01:59:20,620
There's so many articles that you see 
today that you,

2420
01:59:20,621 --> 01:59:24,640
you look at the title of the article and
it has very little to do with the actual

2421
01:59:24,641 --> 01:59:29,641
article itself.
It just because they come up mean this 

2422
01:59:29,641 --> 01:59:30,100
salacious headlines.
They're just,

2423
01:59:30,160 --> 01:59:33,220
they're so attractive.
And it seems like today especially,

2424
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:38,380
you're seeing less and less people 
reading the Washington Post,

2425
01:59:38,381 --> 01:59:40,660
the New York Times,
the La Times,

2426
01:59:40,720 --> 01:59:41,500
they're struggling.

2427
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:46,360
And one of the ways they keep up is by 
giving people what they want.

2428
01:59:46,361 --> 01:59:47,680
If it bleeds,
it leads.

2429
01:59:47,681 --> 01:59:52,681
If you know,
who is this crazy asshole that shot 58 

2430
01:59:52,681 --> 01:59:52,681
people,
let's,

2431
01:59:52,681 --> 01:59:53,590
let's find out what's going on in his 
life.

2432
01:59:53,800 --> 01:59:55,960
It was his dad,
who was this who says brother,

2433
01:59:56,050 --> 01:59:58,750
exactly.
And that is according to this,

2434
01:59:58,790 --> 01:59:59,940
this movement.
I mean it's,

2435
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:01,690
it's,
it's a case that's not so innocent.

2436
02:00:01,691 --> 02:00:06,691
It's not like the kind of click bait.
You wouldn't believe what happened to 

2437
02:00:06,691 --> 02:00:10,280
the 19 seventies actress so and so.
And the picture of her in her seventies 

2438
02:00:10,280 --> 02:00:13,990
if you know that kind of click bait,
but this is click bait that does real 

2439
02:00:13,990 --> 02:00:13,990
harm.
And there are other,

2440
02:00:14,520 --> 02:00:16,600
you do have to balance it against,
of course,

2441
02:00:16,630 --> 02:00:18,730
freedom of the press.
You don't want there to be,

2442
02:00:18,731 --> 02:00:23,731
you know,
governments to tell newspapers where 

2443
02:00:23,731 --> 02:00:23,731
they can publish.

2444
02:00:23,731 --> 02:00:26,730
But there have been some precedents 
where press has voluntarily impose some 

2445
02:00:26,730 --> 02:00:29,620
standards that do nothing to abrogate 
freedom of the press.

2446
02:00:29,621 --> 02:00:32,110
But to make people better off.
So I'll give you an example from sports.

2447
02:00:32,620 --> 02:00:33,980
Uh,
when the,

2448
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:39,000
the TV networks adopted a policy of not 
filming a fans that run onto the field,

2449
02:00:41,510 --> 02:00:43,660
people stopped running onto the field 
because why do they do it?

2450
02:00:43,661 --> 02:00:44,380
So they can say,
you know,

2451
02:00:44,381 --> 02:00:47,740
hi mom to be broadcast to 300 million TV
sets.

2452
02:00:48,280 --> 02:00:53,280
Of course,
Canada had a policy of no longer 

2453
02:00:53,280 --> 02:00:56,200
publishing the names of juvenile killers
and uh,

2454
02:00:56,440 --> 02:01:01,440
you know,
that was a voluntary restraint and it 

2455
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:01,770
was socially responsible and I think 
there is something to be said for,

2456
02:01:02,040 --> 02:01:05,950
for not giving rampage killers the 
audience that they seek.

2457
02:01:06,750 --> 02:01:08,230
Hm.
Yeah.

2458
02:01:08,231 --> 02:01:11,770
I think that makes a lot of sense in 
terms of,

2459
02:01:11,771 --> 02:01:12,700
uh,
you know,

2460
02:01:12,701 --> 02:01:17,310
the greater good of humanity,
but if you're a newspaper guy and your,

2461
02:01:17,450 --> 02:01:22,450
your,
your business is just to sell 

2462
02:01:22,450 --> 02:01:22,450
newspapers,
you're,

2463
02:01:22,450 --> 02:01:22,450
you're a bottom line person.

2464
02:01:22,450 --> 02:01:27,120
That the whole thing is just to include,
increase the amount of revenue that 

2465
02:01:27,120 --> 02:01:27,370
comes into your institution.
Yeah.

2466
02:01:27,371 --> 02:01:27,850
And,
and,

2467
02:01:27,851 --> 02:01:29,480
and not go bankrupt.
Yeah.

2468
02:01:29,800 --> 02:01:30,910
Especially today.
Right.

2469
02:01:30,911 --> 02:01:35,911
But you know,
journalists especially in a mainstream 

2470
02:01:35,911 --> 02:01:39,710
forums like the,
the major networks and CNN and the today

2471
02:01:39,711 --> 02:01:42,780
and so on,
they still have a huge readership and,

2472
02:01:42,980 --> 02:01:44,650
and they do,
they have,

2473
02:01:44,690 --> 02:01:46,340
they have to look at themselves in the 
mirror.

2474
02:01:46,341 --> 02:01:48,140
They do have journalistic codes of 
ethics.

2475
02:01:48,141 --> 02:01:53,141
That's kind of one of the things that 
distinguishes them from the fake news 

2476
02:01:53,141 --> 02:01:54,380
and the rumor mills.
And so,

2477
02:01:54,381 --> 02:01:57,560
and that will always attract a large 
following.

2478
02:01:57,561 --> 02:02:02,561
You,
you want to be able to trust what you 

2479
02:02:02,561 --> 02:02:02,561
can read and so they've got a,
I think,

2480
02:02:02,561 --> 02:02:06,490
balance that against raw bottom line 
because if they lose their integrity 

2481
02:02:06,490 --> 02:02:08,600
than that's not so good for the bottom 
line in the long run either.

2482
02:02:09,420 --> 02:02:14,420
Do you think that there's.
I wonder if there's room for new media 

2483
02:02:15,751 --> 02:02:20,751
today in terms of.
I mean we obviously have these 

2484
02:02:20,751 --> 02:02:22,920
established places like the New York 
Times and like the Washington Post,

2485
02:02:22,921 --> 02:02:27,090
but I wonder if that,
these,

2486
02:02:27,290 --> 02:02:29,840
these like,
well respected,

2487
02:02:30,730 --> 02:02:35,100
longstanding traditional venue that I 
wonder if that's really the right way to

2488
02:02:35,101 --> 02:02:35,850
do it anymore.

2489
02:02:36,420 --> 02:02:41,420
Well,
there has been a simultaneous with the 

2490
02:02:41,420 --> 02:02:43,080
kind of bottom feeders and the clickbait
factories,

2491
02:02:43,740 --> 02:02:46,960
there are a lot of really good new 
electronic magazines.

2492
02:02:47,300 --> 02:02:52,300
No vocs and medium and Pacific Standard 
at Nautilus and Colette and Ian and uh,

2493
02:02:54,540 --> 02:02:55,230
you know,
there are others.

2494
02:02:55,231 --> 02:02:56,310
So,
uh,

2495
02:02:56,311 --> 02:03:01,311
and,
and a couple of decades earlier slate a 

2496
02:03:01,311 --> 02:03:01,410
new.
These are really,

2497
02:03:01,411 --> 02:03:06,411
really good and you often can read 
things that you're not going to find 

2498
02:03:06,411 --> 02:03:09,110
necessarily in the legacy papers.
And they're responsible and they have 

2499
02:03:09,110 --> 02:03:09,210
fact checkers and they're,
you know,

2500
02:03:09,211 --> 02:03:14,211
they're not,
they're not clickbait factories and so 

2501
02:03:14,211 --> 02:03:14,211
there is a,
it's funny,

2502
02:03:14,211 --> 02:03:18,651
almost inequality in an intelligent 
media where there's a lot of real crap 

2503
02:03:18,651 --> 02:03:21,740
at the bottom,
but there's also a room at the top for,

2504
02:03:21,741 --> 02:03:26,741
for new voices,
when you look at a guy like the 

2505
02:03:26,741 --> 02:03:26,741
president,

2506
02:03:26,741 --> 02:03:28,430
the United States who loves to use that 
term fake news,

2507
02:03:28,431 --> 02:03:33,431
so it's,
it's one of the weirder times ever is 

2508
02:03:33,431 --> 02:03:36,490
his attacks on the media and it seems to
be very similar to like the way he 

2509
02:03:38,601 --> 02:03:43,601
reacted to Barack Obama,
mocking him during that speech,

2510
02:03:43,820 --> 02:03:48,820
like the media,
when they criticize him and critique 

2511
02:03:48,820 --> 02:03:52,091
him,
his response is to completely attacked 

2512
02:03:52,091 --> 02:03:54,440
them and just say that they're useless 
and fake and it's.

2513
02:03:55,200 --> 02:04:00,200
It's a weird time for,
for news when it comes to that and for 

2514
02:04:00,200 --> 02:04:00,740
journalism.

2515
02:04:00,970 --> 02:04:01,690
No,
I agree.

2516
02:04:01,691 --> 02:04:06,691
It is a very disturbing phenomenon 
because there is a phenomenon of fake 

2517
02:04:06,691 --> 02:04:10,171
news,
but fake news is not the same thing as 

2518
02:04:10,171 --> 02:04:10,300
coverage.
That criticizes the precedent.

2519
02:04:10,540 --> 02:04:11,750
Right?
Exactly.

2520
02:04:11,800 --> 02:04:14,920
An example of a real lack of 
comprehension of the,

2521
02:04:14,921 --> 02:04:18,760
of how democracy works.
Mainly if you're the president,

2522
02:04:18,790 --> 02:04:20,950
you can be,
will be,

2523
02:04:20,951 --> 02:04:22,510
should be criticized,
yes.

2524
02:04:22,540 --> 02:04:27,540
How democracy works.
We don't have a supreme divine leader 

2525
02:04:27,540 --> 02:04:31,930
that we consider it infallible and um,
this event and that we bow down in front

2526
02:04:31,931 --> 02:04:33,400
of it.
Anything he says goes,

2527
02:04:33,880 --> 02:04:38,880
he's temporarily kind of a steward.
He's temporarily overseeing the 

2528
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:39,480
government,
but you know,

2529
02:04:39,500 --> 02:04:42,120
he screws up and if he says something 
that's not true,

2530
02:04:42,180 --> 02:04:47,180
the people have the right to criticism 
or criticized him and they better be 

2531
02:04:47,180 --> 02:04:47,610
that criticism.
Otherwise we're going to get a,

2532
02:04:47,611 --> 02:04:51,330
you know,
a tyrant or a desk bought and,

2533
02:04:51,360 --> 02:04:53,810
uh,
taking any criticism and,

2534
02:04:53,870 --> 02:04:57,750
and labeling it fake news,
which is a real funnel problem.

2535
02:04:57,751 --> 02:05:02,640
Fake news is a genuinely anti democratic
impulse and it's really disturbing.

2536
02:05:02,930 --> 02:05:07,930
It is disturbing.
It's also disturbing his attacks on the 

2537
02:05:07,930 --> 02:05:10,700
different intelligence agencies tax on a
law enforcement.

2538
02:05:10,701 --> 02:05:12,080
It's,
it's real weird.

2539
02:05:12,280 --> 02:05:15,870
It's weird.
It's a real weird that you know it.

2540
02:05:16,010 --> 02:05:18,260
If you boil it all down and you look at 
it like,

2541
02:05:18,261 --> 02:05:18,830
well,
what's going on?

2542
02:05:18,860 --> 02:05:19,130
Oh,
well,

2543
02:05:19,131 --> 02:05:20,840
anyone,
anyone that's after him,

2544
02:05:20,841 --> 02:05:23,030
anyone that's attacking him,
criticizing him,

2545
02:05:23,300 --> 02:05:28,300
like the,
these people get demeaned and he uses 

2546
02:05:28,300 --> 02:05:30,971
his influence and his power to kind of 
shut down all of these criticisms 

2547
02:05:30,971 --> 02:05:33,140
without any seemingly without any 
concern,

2548
02:05:33,141 --> 02:05:38,141
for the longterm consequences of 
diminishing the impact of these media.

2549
02:05:38,421 --> 02:05:38,550
A

2550
02:05:39,970 --> 02:05:40,950
really important point.
Yeah.

2551
02:05:40,980 --> 02:05:43,720
Again,
this is a big theme of enlightenment now

2552
02:05:43,721 --> 02:05:48,721
is what makes progress possible is that 
we have the institutions that are 

2553
02:05:50,020 --> 02:05:54,340
smarter than any of the flawed 
individuals that make it make it up,

2554
02:05:54,500 --> 02:05:57,370
that we recognize it.
We humans are,

2555
02:05:57,540 --> 02:05:58,200
you know,
what,

2556
02:05:58,250 --> 02:05:59,090
what kind of smart,
poor,

2557
02:05:59,091 --> 02:06:02,650
not that smart and we all like to think 
that we're good and decent and wise,

2558
02:06:02,651 --> 02:06:06,120
but no one of us in particular is that 
good and decent and yes,

2559
02:06:06,520 --> 02:06:11,520
but we can set up rules and institutions
that make the society as a whole better 

2560
02:06:11,520 --> 02:06:13,540
than any of the individuals that make it
up.

2561
02:06:13,720 --> 02:06:16,360
And democratic government is the prime 
example.

2562
02:06:16,420 --> 02:06:21,420
And the whole,
the difference between a democracy and 

2563
02:06:21,420 --> 02:06:24,420
as a cultive personality like Mao in 
China or Stalin in Russia,

2564
02:06:24,740 --> 02:06:28,470
Hitler in Germany or uh,
uh,

2565
02:06:28,620 --> 02:06:31,780
Mugabe in Zimbabwe now,
uh,

2566
02:06:31,781 --> 02:06:33,790
or,
or the Kim's in North Korea,

2567
02:06:34,120 --> 02:06:39,120
is that we don't worship a supreme 
leader who kind of embodies the virtue 

2568
02:06:39,701 --> 02:06:40,480
of the people.

2569
02:06:40,750 --> 02:06:44,740
That's the idea that the United States 
tried to get away from the ideas.

2570
02:06:44,910 --> 02:06:47,200
You got to procedure,
you've got some rules,

2571
02:06:47,380 --> 02:06:48,100
you gotTa,
you know,

2572
02:06:48,110 --> 02:06:53,110
you have to have someone making 
decisions but you kind of reign it in 

2573
02:06:53,110 --> 02:06:54,970
and it's not about him.
It's about the whole system.

2574
02:06:55,510 --> 02:07:00,510
And the fact that we've now got a leader
who just doesn't really seem to 

2575
02:07:00,510 --> 02:07:03,661
understand that.
He seems to think that it's all about 

2576
02:07:03,661 --> 02:07:03,661
him.
And that if you just,

2577
02:07:03,661 --> 02:07:04,720
you know,
I alone consultant,

2578
02:07:05,110 --> 02:07:06,130
you know,
trust me,

2579
02:07:06,131 --> 02:07:07,450
let me do it.
And,

2580
02:07:07,480 --> 02:07:08,530
uh,
uh,

2581
02:07:08,531 --> 02:07:09,250
the,
the,

2582
02:07:09,310 --> 02:07:11,920
all these rules and regulations are the 
deep state,

2583
02:07:11,921 --> 02:07:13,780
the administrative state.
Well,

2584
02:07:13,930 --> 02:07:16,270
thank God for the deep state.
The administrative state.

2585
02:07:16,271 --> 02:07:20,350
It prevents some desk bought from 
foisting is cracked brain schemes on the

2586
02:07:20,351 --> 02:07:25,351
whole population.
We do need rules and bureaucrats and 

2587
02:07:25,351 --> 02:07:27,730
checks and balances as an oppressed.
The can criticize the leader.

2588
02:07:27,790 --> 02:07:31,200
As a psychologist,
when you're looking at all this is,

2589
02:07:31,240 --> 02:07:33,880
is this a fascinating study to you or is
it terrifying?

2590
02:07:34,990 --> 02:07:36,820
I guess?
I guess some of each.

2591
02:07:36,970 --> 02:07:39,490
I'd rather not be as fascinated,
right,

2592
02:07:39,980 --> 02:07:44,980
because ultimately you really don't want
human psychology to be determining the 

2593
02:07:44,980 --> 02:07:46,720
fate of the world.
You kind of want,

2594
02:07:46,750 --> 02:07:49,270
or at least you want one product of 
human psychology,

2595
02:07:49,300 --> 02:07:54,300
namely what we collectively irrationally
agree upon to be embodied in a set of 

2596
02:07:54,881 --> 02:07:57,700
rules and procedures and so it's not 
about,

2597
02:07:57,730 --> 02:07:58,750
you know,
that guy.

2598
02:07:59,170 --> 02:08:03,790
There's also a way of behaving that we 
deem presidential and Barack Obama,

2599
02:08:03,791 --> 02:08:05,890
in my opinion,
embodied that better than anybody.

2600
02:08:05,891 --> 02:08:10,891
He was very composed,
like one of the most composed leaders 

2601
02:08:10,891 --> 02:08:12,220
ever in terms of leaders in the United 
States,

2602
02:08:12,221 --> 02:08:16,690
like the way he would communicate and 
the way he would respond to criticism.

2603
02:08:17,020 --> 02:08:22,020
He just had a very sort of composed a 
higher level of his ability to 

2604
02:08:25,541 --> 02:08:27,310
communicate is.
It was just,

2605
02:08:28,090 --> 02:08:29,950
it was very clean in a way.

2606
02:08:30,630 --> 02:08:31,490
I agree,
and,

2607
02:08:31,491 --> 02:08:36,491
and it was,
it was a kind of a dignity and state 

2608
02:08:36,491 --> 02:08:40,191
street and yeah,
and decorum and statesman and there's a 

2609
02:08:40,191 --> 02:08:43,701
reason for it.
It isn't just that it makes you feel 

2610
02:08:43,701 --> 02:08:43,701
good when you see it,
but it actually is making a statement,

2611
02:08:43,701 --> 02:08:46,050
namely,
it isn't about me.

2612
02:08:46,620 --> 02:08:51,620
I'm occupying this office not to,
not to prove what a big shot I am,

2613
02:08:52,381 --> 02:08:53,760
what a genius,
what a,

2614
02:08:53,820 --> 02:08:54,730
a,
uh,

2615
02:08:54,850 --> 02:08:56,550
a glorious,
Noble,

2616
02:08:56,551 --> 02:09:00,210
divine figure I am.
But I've got this big responsibility.

2617
02:09:00,211 --> 02:09:05,211
I've got power to kill hundreds of 
millions of people or to make them 

2618
02:09:05,730 --> 02:09:07,640
better off or worse off.
Uh,

2619
02:09:07,650 --> 02:09:09,510
I take that seriously.
Uh,

2620
02:09:09,540 --> 02:09:14,540
it's not about me feeling really 
empowered is about me kind of serving 

2621
02:09:14,540 --> 02:09:19,431
the people that elected me.
And that kind of self restraint and 

2622
02:09:19,431 --> 02:09:22,650
respect for the office is a way of 
reaffirming that principle of democracy.

2623
02:09:23,260 --> 02:09:27,570
What also concerns me is that the person
who's in charge is.

2624
02:09:28,080 --> 02:09:33,080
This is how a lot of the rest of the 
country views the nation itself.

2625
02:09:34,140 --> 02:09:39,140
Like and if you have a person who's 
measured and objective and well thought 

2626
02:09:39,151 --> 02:09:44,151
out and well spoken and that when when 
you would hear especially Obama 

2627
02:09:44,241 --> 02:09:46,710
speeches,
agree with them or disagree with him,

2628
02:09:46,920 --> 02:09:51,920
everything was very clean,
like the way he maybe I use the word 

2629
02:09:51,920 --> 02:09:53,370
clean too much,
but it was,

2630
02:09:53,490 --> 02:09:58,490
it was eloquent in.
It was smarter than most people.

2631
02:09:59,011 --> 02:10:04,011
You know,
it was more more articulate than most 

2632
02:10:04,011 --> 02:10:04,011
people,
you know,

2633
02:10:04,011 --> 02:10:08,000
tho those,
the way the sentences were formed were 

2634
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,880
impressive in the intellectual capacity 
of the person that's delivering those 

2635
02:10:13,081 --> 02:10:17,250
words and so that made us feel better 
about who we were as a country.

2636
02:10:17,430 --> 02:10:20,880
We're being led by this very wise,
smart person.

2637
02:10:21,060 --> 02:10:22,770
Whether you agree with his policies or 
not,

2638
02:10:23,160 --> 02:10:27,030
there's no denying that this is a.
it's an exceptional human.

2639
02:10:28,090 --> 02:10:29,050
I agree.
And again,

2640
02:10:29,770 --> 02:10:31,930
I think there's a greater reason behind 
it.

2641
02:10:31,931 --> 02:10:34,670
To United States has the most powerful 
military.

2642
02:10:35,420 --> 02:10:40,420
It's the richest country.
The United States does matters to the 

2643
02:10:40,420 --> 02:10:43,751
rest of the world and to reassure the 
rest of the world that we're not just a 

2644
02:10:43,751 --> 02:10:47,180
bunch of cowboys who are going to do 
what's makes us the most powerful,

2645
02:10:47,181 --> 02:10:49,610
but we really think about our role.
We don't.

2646
02:10:49,940 --> 02:10:53,330
We don't do rash things that could 
really be bad for the world.

2647
02:10:53,720 --> 02:10:58,720
That gets conveyed symbolically in the 
way that a leader comports himself or 

2648
02:10:59,690 --> 02:11:00,200
herself.

2649
02:11:00,810 --> 02:11:02,950
Well,
one of the things that I think of when I

2650
02:11:02,951 --> 02:11:07,951
see this whole thing going down and I 
see also this a reaction to this 

2651
02:11:07,951 --> 02:11:12,751
president,
like the giant women's March being 

2652
02:11:12,751 --> 02:11:12,751
called the women's March all day and it 
is a woman's march,

2653
02:11:12,751 --> 02:11:14,110
but it's also a march against the 
president.

2654
02:11:14,500 --> 02:11:16,120
I mean that's a big part of what this 
says.

2655
02:11:16,121 --> 02:11:19,330
It's like the idea is that he is kind of
against women in their eyes,

2656
02:11:19,720 --> 02:11:24,720
whether it's correct or not,
but that this March is to shorter sort 

2657
02:11:24,720 --> 02:11:28,320
of show solidarity that they disagree 
with the way things are going and I 

2658
02:11:28,541 --> 02:11:33,400
wonder if having a guy like this in 
power is going to,

2659
02:11:33,670 --> 02:11:36,100
as we were talking about before,
this sort of swing effect,

2660
02:11:36,460 --> 02:11:41,460
gonna re reignite more people to be 
politically active and more people to do

2661
02:11:44,100 --> 02:11:46,150
recognize the things that they don't 
like,

2662
02:11:46,300 --> 02:11:51,300
like the calling the media fake news or 
like the attacks on the intelligence 

2663
02:11:51,300 --> 02:11:52,040
community.
All these,

2664
02:11:52,190 --> 02:11:57,190
these various things,
these things that people deem to be 

2665
02:11:57,190 --> 02:12:00,961
racist is things that people deem to be 
hostile or or silly that he says and 

2666
02:12:02,951 --> 02:12:07,060
that there'll be some sort of a powerful
reaction in response to that.

2667
02:12:07,300 --> 02:12:08,540
That is.
That is.

2668
02:12:08,580 --> 02:12:13,580
That is the hope.
It's too soon to tell because there are 

2669
02:12:13,580 --> 02:12:16,450
two possibilities and one of them is 
that he's sort of shattered.

2670
02:12:16,451 --> 02:12:21,451
Some norms created a precedent that 
means their successors could be even 

2671
02:12:22,070 --> 02:12:25,750
worse because norms can be fragile.
Like what you just don't do.

2672
02:12:25,810 --> 02:12:27,700
If you're president,
well now you can do them.

2673
02:12:27,770 --> 02:12:32,770
Right.
That's the pessimistic view of the 

2674
02:12:32,770 --> 02:12:32,770
optimistic view is that the country will
say,

2675
02:12:32,770 --> 02:12:34,240
oh my God,
look what we've been through.

2676
02:12:34,241 --> 02:12:35,850
We try that.
Let's get we,

2677
02:12:35,930 --> 02:12:36,480
we,
we,

2678
02:12:36,481 --> 02:12:38,160
we tried crazy.
Let's get back to sane.

2679
02:12:38,250 --> 02:12:38,850
Right?
Uh,

2680
02:12:39,050 --> 02:12:40,900
so those,
those are the two possibilities.

2681
02:12:41,210 --> 02:12:42,580
Um,
you're out of time.

2682
02:12:43,070 --> 02:12:43,930
Yes.
Listen,

2683
02:12:43,960 --> 02:12:46,060
thank you so much for being here.
Your book.

2684
02:12:46,090 --> 02:12:47,800
One more time.
Enlightenment now.

2685
02:12:48,180 --> 02:12:49,630
No reason.
Science,

2686
02:12:49,631 --> 02:12:51,610
humanism and progress.
Thank you so much.

2687
02:12:51,611 --> 02:12:53,800
It's been an honor and a pleasure.
I really appreciate you being honest.

2688
02:12:53,830 --> 02:12:54,730
Been Mine.
Thank you so much,

2689
02:12:54,731 --> 02:12:56,680
Joe.
Thank you Steven Pinker,

2690
02:12:56,681 --> 02:12:58,170

Bye.

2691
02:13:01,390 --> 02:13:02,430
Wow.
