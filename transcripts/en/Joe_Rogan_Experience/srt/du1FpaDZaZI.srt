1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:00,581
I don't want to.

2
00:00:00,581 --> 00:00:02,260
If I don't want to believe Shit,

3
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:03,220
if it,

4
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:04,270
if it doesn't hurt me,

5
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,480
I it shouldn't be such a big deal.

6
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:14,620
I want to know right now on this podcast,

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,870
who is running this country?

8
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,560
There's a bunch of different factions
that you call the government.

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:24,993
History,

10
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:25,953
science,

11
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,100
education,

12
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:28,413
energy.

13
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:32,140
Everything has always been
controlled by the government.

14
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:33,310
Since day one.

15
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,410
Look at the time,

16
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,970
illegal aliens in the workspace
as recommended by the commission,

17
00:00:42,971 --> 00:00:45,700
headed by former
congresswoman Barbara Jordan.

18
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,720
If you look into the experiments to
prove that the earth is spinning,

19
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,890
all of them failed.

20
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,753
Look into it.

21
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,170
You're just having a burned this.

22
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,430
If you look into it and you,

23
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:55,900
and you have proof that it is round,

24
00:00:55,901 --> 00:00:56,650
instead of going,

25
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:56,801
oh,

26
00:00:56,801 --> 00:00:57,910
some scientists figured out,

27
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:58,870
somebody figured it out,

28
00:00:58,930 --> 00:00:59,741
somebody figured out.

29
00:00:59,741 --> 00:01:01,420
But you figure it out.

30
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:02,320
You try to figure it out.

31
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:02,950
No,

32
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:04,120
because when they look into it,

33
00:01:04,121 --> 00:01:04,990
it's common sense.

34
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,220
And when you look into it,

35
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:15,081
wait a gentleman,

36
00:01:15,081 --> 00:01:17,000
black helicopters have been spotted.

37
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,360
Two 21 holy Shit.

38
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,063
Show

39
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,730
two 2120 for Burt for one pound,

40
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,840
one pound less.

41
00:01:51,841 --> 00:01:53,250
One fucking pound.

42
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,030
You fucking do 16 Tom
gets it running away.

43
00:02:00,061 --> 00:02:01,020
Ladies and gentlemen,

44
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,670
I want to do the Puerto Rican beard.

45
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,420
I'm going to fucking say this.

46
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,770
Puerto Rican guy.

47
00:02:10,771 --> 00:02:11,604
Beard.

48
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:14,530
Yeah.

49
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,500
It said Puerto Rican facial hair.

50
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,221
Taj Things.

51
00:02:27,221 --> 00:02:29,670
Maybe they knew Burke rd.

52
00:02:29,671 --> 00:02:30,520
Uncomfortable with this.

53
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,670
He's giving you a Hitler Son.

54
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:39,431
Oh my God.

55
00:02:39,431 --> 00:02:40,450
This is so stupid.

56
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,610
What's wrong with us?

57
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,950
We're all adults.

58
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,990
What's the fuck is wrong with us?

59
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,490
Oh my God.

60
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,063
Can I please see?

61
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,030
Oh my God.

62
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,370
So you're doing the prince?

63
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,463
No.

64
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,000
What are you doing today?

65
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,953
Someone's hair in my mouth.

66
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,460
You look really good.

67
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,090
Accurate.

68
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:17,430
Really?

69
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,263
Yeah.

70
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:18,830
Yeah.

71
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:19,663
You're gonna like it.

72
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,750
That's actually not bad
and I'm not bullshitting.

73
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,733
You look good.

74
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,673
This feels,

75
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:27,781
here's the thing,

76
00:03:27,781 --> 00:03:28,614
man.

77
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,020
Oh boy.

78
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,090
I look like I work at blue.

79
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:32,943
The apes.

80
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,370
I look at him.

81
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:35,400
Fuck a monkey.

82
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:36,890
No,

83
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,480
no.

84
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,410
This is not looking you how you
definitely don't live in your hometown

85
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,800
and you got to Pennzoil Tattoo.

86
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,110
We can start another contest.

87
00:03:50,111 --> 00:03:51,110
I'm totally comfortable with that.

88
00:03:51,111 --> 00:03:52,720
It seems like Burt wants
starting on the content.

89
00:03:52,721 --> 00:03:53,710
I want to start another contest.

90
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,240
I want already to be involved too.

91
00:03:55,241 --> 00:03:56,290
Cause I like Ari's Walton.

92
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,130
What does that mean?

93
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:58,180
Well there was snakes,

94
00:03:58,181 --> 00:03:59,014
man,

95
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,460
you're 100% but you get,

96
00:04:00,461 --> 00:04:01,480
you lose your beard.

97
00:04:01,481 --> 00:04:01,750
Listen,

98
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,583
you had somebody.

99
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,070
Oh yeah,

100
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:03,260
true.

101
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,093
Welsh on your bed.

102
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,080
Oh you're so rounds.

103
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:14,360
I just asked her a measurement of the
heights and when they got the national it

104
00:04:14,361 --> 00:04:15,194
was corny line

105
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:17,951
ours.

106
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:18,784
Right to ask for this.

107
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,490
How many tweets did you get caught?

108
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,413
You're welcome.

109
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,433
Wow.

110
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,310
Boston.

111
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,710
It'll keep you all want
to say like five hours.

112
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:32,210
You would have to really
prepare that time.

113
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,620
He's willing.

114
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,510
I want to see where he's at number.

115
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:36,390
What shape right now.

116
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:36,811
So wait,

117
00:04:36,811 --> 00:04:37,121
he,

118
00:04:37,121 --> 00:04:39,360
you didn't get to really
prepare to do five hours.

119
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,440
I think you could do it.

120
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,610
I'm not saying you couldn't do it.

121
00:04:41,611 --> 00:04:42,870
If we're not giving you a year,

122
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:43,291
idiot,

123
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:44,720
fuck you're going to do it.

124
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,610
What's the next marathon?

125
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,040
What's the what?

126
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,890
What city are they going
to be in San Diego,

127
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:52,724
la.

128
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,753
Fuck.

129
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,110
Cause like say next weekend
if I had a girlfriend,

130
00:04:59,111 --> 00:05:00,910
she might say it's Friday.

131
00:05:00,911 --> 00:05:01,601
What are we doing?

132
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:01,900
I'm like,

133
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,733
oh,

134
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,360
watching me write for four hours.

135
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,410
And so that's not the way to be.

136
00:05:07,411 --> 00:05:08,340
You can't do that.

137
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:13,170
So I can't be a good persons
other half because I'm always,

138
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:18,230
the work has always attracted me
more than coming home to someone.

139
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,463
Wow.

140
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:19,761
Like I,

141
00:05:19,761 --> 00:05:23,310
I can't stand the idea of
someone of living with a person.

142
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:24,900
I can do it on the bus,

143
00:05:24,901 --> 00:05:26,240
cause this das boat and work,

144
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:26,760
you know,

145
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,810
going down the road.

146
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,093
Um,

147
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,531
but I,

148
00:05:29,531 --> 00:05:34,170
I never would want to like
wake up and she's there.

149
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:35,243
I have no,

150
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,203
no aversion.

151
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,420
We'll get expression,

152
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:40,900
but he's like,

153
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,790
look to your right.

154
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,330
She's there as well.

155
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,630
It's every day here we are together
and I'm just not wired that way.

156
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:49,210
So,

157
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,043
um,

158
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,780
so he's the main figurehead,

159
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,031
right?

160
00:05:52,031 --> 00:05:52,350
Right.

161
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,270
He's the main guy like
right up with Miscavige.

162
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:54,720
Right.

163
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,640
And then John Travolta somewhere in that,

164
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,040
I think

165
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,570
John was given what,

166
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:00,190
uh,

167
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:00,830
um,

168
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:04,350
a designation called con where they hunt.

169
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,331
Could con not,

170
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:07,070
can't good con.

171
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:07,650
Yeah.

172
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:08,270
Okay.

173
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,750
K.

174
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:11,750
H.

175
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:11,750
A.

176
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:11,750
K.

177
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:11,750
H.

178
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:11,750
A.

179
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:11,750
N.

180
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:11,820
Kakao.

181
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,320
Okay.

182
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,100
Okay.

183
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,460
He's given this designation of cocoon,

184
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,580
which there's a policy that basically
says you can kill another human being.

185
00:06:19,581 --> 00:06:20,690
If you were conned,

186
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,040
you're going to look the other way.

187
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,103
And he was given,

188
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,080
he was given that by l Ron Hubbard.

189
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,580
Don't make me laugh cause
you gonna make me think.

190
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:32,300
Imagine thousands of emails come
out with them talking about,

191
00:06:32,301 --> 00:06:33,500
we'll have the kids ready,

192
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,191
six,

193
00:06:34,191 --> 00:06:36,410
seven and eight in the
hot tub at this time.

194
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,221
And there'd be,

195
00:06:37,221 --> 00:06:38,330
I don't see anything like that.

196
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:38,541
Oh,

197
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:38,931
it gets you,

198
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:39,540
it gets really clear.

199
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,720
Where did it say that
it was in those emails?

200
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,190
There's fricking thousands of them,

201
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:43,900
but it said,

202
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,710
we'll get the kids in the hot tub.

203
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,573
Yes.

204
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,630
I never saw that.

205
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:47,990
Can you,

206
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,220
can you see if you could find that Jamie?

207
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:50,570
That seems like,

208
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,473
Ooh,

209
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,910
I got so confusing now.

210
00:06:52,911 --> 00:06:53,331
The libs,

211
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:56,000
you confuse every and nobody
knows what bathroom to use.

212
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,700
And I was at a night club the other night
and here's the ladies room right here.

213
00:06:58,701 --> 00:07:00,950
And the men's room was right next
to is a pile of shit in the middle

214
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,110
with a tampon stuck in,

215
00:07:04,111 --> 00:07:04,944
in a fake mustache

216
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,970
and it won't last long.

217
00:07:10,971 --> 00:07:11,450
Hold on.

218
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:12,560
Immediate head rush,

219
00:07:12,561 --> 00:07:13,150
by the way.

220
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:13,610
Really?

221
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:14,211
Oh by the way,

222
00:07:14,211 --> 00:07:14,841
don't inhale it.

223
00:07:14,841 --> 00:07:15,674
Just puff it.

224
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,140
Well,

225
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:18,951
I'm a pot smoker,

226
00:07:18,951 --> 00:07:19,540
bro.

227
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,690
Well you don't want to hail that.

228
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:21,710
There's no filter on that.

229
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,933
What are your buzzy,

230
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:28,240
but often it's mind blowing when you
learn that some infinities are bigger than

231
00:07:28,251 --> 00:07:29,084
others.

232
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:36,440
Joe Rogan just lean two feet away from
the microphone and the properties of each

233
00:07:36,441 --> 00:07:37,280
of those regions,

234
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:42,740
whether they're conducive to forming
galaxies and stars and planets and people

235
00:07:42,741 --> 00:07:43,461
may be different.

236
00:07:43,461 --> 00:07:48,440
So we could say logically in that picture
that the reason the universe looks

237
00:07:48,441 --> 00:07:51,110
like the way it does is because
we're here to measure it.

238
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,280
Oh my God,

239
00:07:55,281 --> 00:07:56,360
we should leave it at that.

240
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:56,810
Okay.

241
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:57,770
We should close with that.

242
00:07:57,771 --> 00:08:00,730
That is the mind blower
blowers and you know,

243
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:02,500
iron man has that blue thing in his chest.

244
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:03,363
Yeah.

245
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,510
I don't think women are evil.

246
00:08:04,511 --> 00:08:05,890
I like iron woman or iron man.

247
00:08:05,891 --> 00:08:06,401
Their magic.

248
00:08:06,401 --> 00:08:06,970
Right.

249
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,920
But by ripping out that blue thing,

250
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,550
you're ripping out their ability to have
children and be mothers and everything,

251
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:15,820
and then you put in a piece
of shit into iron man's chest.

252
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:18,100
That's what feminists and
like this woman are there.

253
00:08:18,101 --> 00:08:18,934
Shit chests.

254
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,490
They're malfunctioning.

255
00:08:22,491 --> 00:08:24,600
Robots kill Em.

256
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,690
Milo wants genocide killing.

257
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,380
So do you think that they're imitating
what they think are patriarchal

258
00:08:30,381 --> 00:08:31,041
societies?

259
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:34,190
They're doing their version of it and
that's what they're doing with this.

260
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,560
The whole matriarchal posturing.

261
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:37,670
It's like Clark Kent,

262
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,050
I want to run an article.

263
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:40,903
I'm writing.

264
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:41,120
No,

265
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,490
you're not running it and you'd go Clark,

266
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,450
simmer down.

267
00:08:44,451 --> 00:08:45,284
Dude.

268
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:49,750
I look at the things that I went through
as a gift because I have gotten a gift

269
00:08:49,751 --> 00:08:50,584
of feeling

270
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,670
retired during my career.

271
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,150
Who else gets that?

272
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,960
Some people retire for five years,

273
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:04,140
lose their freaking mind and up in the
bar and come back and try to fight again.

274
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,120
10 years later was a weakened body.

275
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:07,661
A mass comm.

276
00:09:07,661 --> 00:09:08,170
Abuse.

277
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:08,820
Why?

278
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,653
Why though?

279
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,740
Why are they doing that?

280
00:09:10,741 --> 00:09:12,720
They're not doing it because
they're physically capable.

281
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,630
They're doing it because they never
dealt with their life away from fighting.

282
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,820
Fighting was there like
fighting is who they are.

283
00:09:17,821 --> 00:09:19,020
Fighting is their persona.

284
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,820
So take away fighting.

285
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:21,863
What are they?

286
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,180
They're in the bar drinking away with.

287
00:09:24,181 --> 00:09:25,014
They're not,

288
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:26,880
instead of drinking,

289
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,850
putting the booze down and knowing
what you are without fighting,

290
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,510
being happy with that chapter of your
life and being able to live who you are.

291
00:09:33,511 --> 00:09:37,890
I've gotten to feel that and now
I can fight with a peace of mind,

292
00:09:37,891 --> 00:09:42,270
knowing how good I am without fighting
and how great I am with it too.

293
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,830
And um,

294
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,013
that's,

295
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,880
that's what this thing's about.

296
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,381
All these fights,

297
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:51,240
all these me attacking those challenges,

298
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:53,190
coming back and winning
and getting my belt back.

299
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,833
Um,

300
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,710
that could only happen because I let
go of control of the things I couldn't

301
00:09:58,711 --> 00:09:59,544
control.

302
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:00,491
Yeah,

303
00:10:00,491 --> 00:10:00,851
he had,

304
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:02,920
he would be the first man I
think about that kind of stuff.

305
00:10:02,921 --> 00:10:04,030
I give a plane crash.

306
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,170
I already know I'm planning ahead.

307
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,790
Did I eat a Vietnamese guy?

308
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:07,993
Why?

309
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,461
Because that's easy.

310
00:10:09,461 --> 00:10:10,420
It's start or move.

311
00:10:10,421 --> 00:10:11,860
If you attack somebody bigger,

312
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,630
you eat somebody bigger
in front of other people.

313
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,800
It's going to alarm people.

314
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,130
But you,

315
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,410
you gotta eat a small person.

316
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,970
So stature is important.

317
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,530
I think if you come down a Viet,

318
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,940
people aren't going to
be that upset at Ya.

319
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,670
Well that means people are
going to be super upset.

320
00:10:24,671 --> 00:10:25,350
What are you talking about?

321
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,230
Tony's dad?

322
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:26,470
Yeah,

323
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,140
their sacrifice.

324
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,980
They're more understanding of things,

325
00:10:29,981 --> 00:10:30,430
dude,

326
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,780
this is the character you're playing.

327
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:32,973
No,

328
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,720
but if you eat a black dude,

329
00:10:34,721 --> 00:10:36,610
you eat a black lady
and her family's here,

330
00:10:36,611 --> 00:10:37,780
they're going to be pissed.

331
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,310
So you think at Vietnamese person,

332
00:10:39,311 --> 00:10:40,144
we'll let you slide.

333
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,270
I think that they'd be much more
forgiving over a couple of day period.

334
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:45,370
I think a like their relatives.

335
00:10:45,371 --> 00:10:46,030
You don't think so?

336
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,500
Honestly one thing.

337
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:47,951
No,

338
00:10:47,951 --> 00:10:48,730
I don't think so.

339
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,410
I definitely think there'd
be super pissed at you,

340
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,850
especially modernized ones.

341
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:55,870
But what is interesting is like Vietnam
is one of the few places where um,

342
00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:00,430
Americans can go back to Vietnam and they
don't seem to hold any grudge at all.

343
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,953
Exhibit a

344
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,091
exhibit a man.

345
00:11:05,091 --> 00:11:05,924
Honestly.

346
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,740
Do you realize 87% gout
poll came out last year?

347
00:11:09,741 --> 00:11:14,270
It's at 87% of the people on the planet
or unhappy with what their life is all

348
00:11:14,271 --> 00:11:18,500
about now on habitat and
10% in addition to that,

349
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,230
87 to 97 hey,

350
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:24,890
what they do little so that
leaves 3% of the planet.

351
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,850
Enjoy what they do.

352
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,470
You're one to 3%.

353
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:27,891
Fuck,

354
00:11:27,891 --> 00:11:29,990
I'm a one of the 100
millions of a percent.

355
00:11:29,991 --> 00:11:30,320
Uh,

356
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:30,540
I,

357
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,101
I'm so happy.

358
00:11:31,101 --> 00:11:32,600
I don't know whether to shit or go blind.

359
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,021
Yes.

360
00:11:33,021 --> 00:11:33,854
So

361
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:35,140
I ended up,

362
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:35,380
you know,

363
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,011
going to the restroom,

364
00:11:36,011 --> 00:11:37,620
looking at the shit kicked all over.

365
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:41,081
It was like,

366
00:11:41,081 --> 00:11:42,250
it must have been in between rounds.

367
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,263
Disgusting.

368
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:43,841
I was like,

369
00:11:43,841 --> 00:11:44,770
there's no trashcan.

370
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,440
It's like silk and gold in this
beautiful palace and stuff.

371
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:50,420
So I just like take my panties off and
just like roll them up and shove him

372
00:11:50,421 --> 00:11:51,254
behind the toilet.

373
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,040
Black

374
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,870
Lace Thong Vladimir Putin.

375
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:56,561
That was mine.

376
00:11:56,561 --> 00:11:56,870
I want to,

377
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:57,820
I want it back.

378
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:58,240
No,

379
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,073
I don't want it back.

380
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,050
Oh,

381
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:00,321
it was,

382
00:12:00,321 --> 00:12:00,521
you know,

383
00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:02,560
in 2000 it was 10 years ago and it's crap.

384
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:02,980
Wow.

385
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,370
Yeah.

386
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:03,761
So,

387
00:12:03,761 --> 00:12:06,550
and then I just go back out there and
it's like Berlusconi was like hitting on

388
00:12:06,551 --> 00:12:08,800
me and like trying to
pick me up and he's like,

389
00:12:08,801 --> 00:12:08,951
Hey,

390
00:12:08,951 --> 00:12:09,910
can I be your boyfriend tonight?

391
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:10,391
And I'm just like,

392
00:12:10,391 --> 00:12:10,960
what?

393
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,390
But he's saying it through a
translator so it was so and I'm like,

394
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:17,470
I smell like shit like that cause I
couldn't do it was up to our dirty

395
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,313
motherfucker.

396
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,550
That was a war on drugs.

397
00:12:21,551 --> 00:12:22,600
We started one drugs.

398
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,640
Turns out we're bringing it in.

399
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,410
Then there's a war on terrorism.

400
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,050
Turns out we created al Qaeda.

401
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,000
You understand why I'm crazy.

402
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,830
I'm crazy because of that shit.

403
00:12:32,831 --> 00:12:33,310
I'm like,

404
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:34,450
if that's real to you man,

405
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,890
she don't think it's real with fish.

406
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,401
I fish.

407
00:12:36,401 --> 00:12:36,700
I had done,

408
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,200
you guys are fooled by the Fisheye Lens.

409
00:12:38,201 --> 00:12:39,034
C'Mon man.

410
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,200
Is that what the fuck is going on with?

411
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,193
I don't know.

412
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:46,300
I don't want you think
there's a conspiracy in the
conspiracy and then they'll

413
00:12:46,301 --> 00:12:49,600
cut the gym home long or Jim Kim Jong.

414
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,513
Oo Cold.

415
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,210
I'm not saying they're actors,

416
00:12:52,211 --> 00:12:54,910
I'm just saying there's something fishy
about the whole North Korea thing.

417
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:55,811
Turn around a source.

418
00:12:55,811 --> 00:12:57,280
Rex is a giant kangaroo.

419
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,150
That's what it is.

420
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,433
That's my guess.

421
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:00,423
That's a fucking,

422
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:03,190
they found a giant kangaroo and when
they figured it out to go do it,

423
00:13:03,191 --> 00:13:04,050
it's a kangaroo or they were like,

424
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:07,420
let's skip off what told you I'm crazy,

425
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,420
but what's the advantage
that's not round you?

426
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:14,100
You got to appreciate the hustle by
Eddie Jones is like absolute belts,

427
00:13:14,101 --> 00:13:15,070
conspiracy theorists.

428
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:15,670
You'd have the,

429
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,181
wow,

430
00:13:16,181 --> 00:13:17,140
I can't believe you said that.

431
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:17,460
The,

432
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,101
exactly.

433
00:13:18,101 --> 00:13:21,790
There's giant weather modification
systems and there's weather wars between

434
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,630
different governments.

435
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,040
I want to know how he got,

436
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,620
I want to know the story of how he got in.

437
00:13:26,621 --> 00:13:26,951
Is there a,

438
00:13:26,951 --> 00:13:28,060
is there a video out there?

439
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,910
Scientology,

440
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:30,743
Scientology who,

441
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,050
how did he get in?

442
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,580
We are allowing this to happen.

443
00:13:33,581 --> 00:13:34,930
It's like we want it to happen.

444
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,550
It's like it's a CIA,

445
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,140
Mk ultra experiment.

446
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,003
What do you mean?

447
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,680
I always wondered how
they're getting away with it.

448
00:13:41,681 --> 00:13:42,610
It's so out in the open.

449
00:13:42,611 --> 00:13:46,510
How come there isn't more psychic
vampires stealing the energy from the kids

450
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,860
were taking these people on.

451
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,150
We're bringing God back in.

452
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,680
He would swear that wasn't very religious,

453
00:13:50,681 --> 00:13:54,220
like Trump has gotten religion learning
about this because let me tell you

454
00:13:54,221 --> 00:13:54,490
something.

455
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:58,330
Trump's not a devil worshiper and he loves
God and he's been briefed on all this

456
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:02,140
and he's gonna roll their ass up so the
pedophiles better get ready to do the

457
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:03,520
rob trials even exists.

458
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,780
That could be a conspirator.

459
00:14:04,781 --> 00:14:04,931
Can I,

460
00:14:04,931 --> 00:14:05,764
can I say one thing?

461
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,210
The Rothschilds are a hoax.

462
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,410
I just know all this crap.

463
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,293
You get crazy.

464
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:12,400
People won't listen to me because I got
too much data and you imagine what this

465
00:14:12,401 --> 00:14:12,850
is like.

466
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,110
You think that they drop,

467
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:18,010
they would have dropped the ball big
time like earnest Byner in 1987 for the

468
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:18,751
browns.

469
00:14:18,751 --> 00:14:19,630
He would have dropped the ball.

470
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,583
If you're not,

471
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,930
if you don't have paid shills online,

472
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:28,140
strategically pushing the
agenda is only controlled of Ai.

473
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:28,990
How'd they get?

474
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,400
How'd the pedophiles getting controlled?

475
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,060
Okay.

476
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:36,060
Do you know that if you go to youtube
and you punch in Nikola Tesla hoax fraud,

477
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,390
nothing comes up.

478
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:41,590
Put in Albert Einstein hoax fraud,

479
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,391
endless videos.

480
00:14:43,391 --> 00:14:43,750
It's,

481
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,180
Oh,

482
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,013
it was a free

483
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:51,580
videos and there was a full out war
inside the government of guys that liked

484
00:14:51,581 --> 00:14:52,230
each steaks,

485
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:56,180
drink beer and have women versus
a bunch of Potbelly pedophiles.

486
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:57,423
Whoa.

487
00:14:58,370 --> 00:14:59,450
I don't know what to believe,

488
00:14:59,451 --> 00:14:59,960
man.

489
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,670
I don't know if the Rothschilds are real.

490
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,350
I don't know of Reptilians of Rio.

491
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,343
I Dunno.

492
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,680
Satanism Israel.

493
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,171
I don't know.

494
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:06,590
Shit.

495
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:11,360
We using human technology to try to take
our best minds and build some type of

496
00:15:11,361 --> 00:15:14,900
breakaway civilization where they're
going to merge with machines,

497
00:15:14,901 --> 00:15:19,010
transcend and break away from the
failed species that has man will power.

498
00:15:19,011 --> 00:15:19,480
That's not,

499
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:19,670
no.

500
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:19,911
Okay.

501
00:15:19,911 --> 00:15:20,211
Let's,

502
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:20,361
uh,

503
00:15:20,361 --> 00:15:21,460
that's about it folks.

504
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:24,800
Time take one day.

505
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,990
If I give you full power,

506
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,033
you're going to be in the hall,

507
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,430
but no one has the time to do Everest,

508
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:34,170
to micro manage the entire world to this.

509
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,013
Right.

510
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:35,841
It's just,

511
00:15:35,841 --> 00:15:36,060
there's,

512
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:40,700
there's only so much shit you can
let people take care of them live.

513
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:43,310
I guess you could let people
take care of themselves.

514
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,730
Illuminati got Ki

515
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,553
Ki

516
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,930
got enough time for mind
control experiments.

517
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,610
There's too much shit going on.

518
00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:00,110
I gotta ask you this one thing for sure
is because I read this and I was like,

519
00:16:00,111 --> 00:16:00,944
what?

520
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:01,640
Um,

521
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,150
here we go.

522
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:02,600
Uh,

523
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,450
you saw someone shape shift.

524
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,493
Oh God.

525
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:09,973
Is it,

526
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:12,820
is that really where
you fucking with people?

527
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,640
That's true.

528
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,041
Really.

529
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:14,090
Yeah.

530
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:14,923
It's true.

531
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:18,740
Because when you told me that
joy Kaufman like moments,

532
00:16:18,741 --> 00:16:19,130
I was like,

533
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:19,371
okay,

534
00:16:19,371 --> 00:16:20,270
I know it's true.

535
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,710
I would tell you off grade,

536
00:16:21,711 --> 00:16:22,910
but I won't say it publicly.

537
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:23,181
Right.

538
00:16:23,181 --> 00:16:23,571
But I mean,

539
00:16:23,571 --> 00:16:24,950
has anybody had been skeptical?

540
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,640
Does anybody yeah.

541
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,510
Everyone's skeptical.

542
00:16:26,511 --> 00:16:26,990
Yeah.

543
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,670
What's your response to that?

544
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,840
You don't know what I know,

545
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:30,701
right?

546
00:16:30,701 --> 00:16:31,090
Well,

547
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:31,923
do you know though?

548
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,301
I can't,

549
00:16:32,301 --> 00:16:32,810
I don't know.

550
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:34,670
I can't tell you some
of the shit that I know,

551
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,260
but that jury is still out.

552
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:40,160
So what are the negative benefits
or the negative affects of this?

553
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,100
This is an explosive,

554
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:43,880
uh,

555
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,713
uh,

556
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:49,250
area of conversation and
it puts my life in danger.

557
00:16:49,251 --> 00:16:52,040
So I reserve the right
not to answer a question.

558
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,113
Whoa.

559
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,920
I didn't expect that.

560
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:58,640
It puts your life in danger
talking about Portabella mushrooms.

561
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,970
He's looking at me silently.

562
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:04,100
I will respectfully move on.

563
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:04,610
Thank you.

564
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:04,970
Yeah,

565
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,350
I mean business,

566
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,120
there's never encounter each find suits,

567
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,040
no pocket squares.

568
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:13,460
Occasionally you find a
t token pocket square,

569
00:17:13,461 --> 00:17:14,990
but you can tell their heart's not in it.

570
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:21,430
The wife stuck in there cause she's so
someone on TV that hadn't been at rent

571
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,360
razzle dazzle about them and they thought,

572
00:17:24,361 --> 00:17:26,060
oh I quite fancy my old man man,

573
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,670
one of them and they would stick it in
the old man's be embarrassed about it and

574
00:17:28,671 --> 00:17:29,070
trust us.

575
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,290
Squeeze out of the way.

576
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,390
Suits are a thing.

577
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,950
The death of the suit,

578
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:39,130
it was the death of the suit was the
present attitude toward Ongo Noah and I'll

579
00:17:40,431 --> 00:17:40,660
go,

580
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,900
oh yeah,

581
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,890
I won't put a tie on and on.

582
00:17:43,891 --> 00:17:44,930
I don't want us to count.

583
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,860
That's how I feel.

584
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,780
But that's what's happened.

585
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:50,160
We've been brainwashed to not dress

586
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:50,910
line gentlemen.

587
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:53,160
But I see a guy like you
and I say that's appealing.

588
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,430
I look how you're dressed and
you're in a conservative suit.

589
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,680
This is a nicer,

590
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:01,800
like I'm sure you could wear any suit you
wanted but you chose assert that has a

591
00:18:01,801 --> 00:18:03,090
certain look to it.

592
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:03,960
Yeah.

593
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,540
I have spent some time
asking around with this Joe,

594
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,800
but a bit like the same reason that we
spent our time asking around with our

595
00:18:10,801 --> 00:18:11,634
pocket square.

596
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:12,630
It's,

597
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:17,630
I remember thinking how much I found the
suit repugnant and I became angry that

598
00:18:19,051 --> 00:18:20,520
the suit had been robbed from us,

599
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,480
and so I had to create an alibi,

600
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:28,320
a way in to understand why is that?

601
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,573
I'd like a suit

602
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:33,390
and you have many puzzles in
front of you that you could solve,

603
00:18:33,391 --> 00:18:34,650
but you choose not to.

604
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,001
You know that.

605
00:18:36,001 --> 00:18:37,890
Those are the things that
weigh on your conscience.

606
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:38,401
It's like,

607
00:18:38,401 --> 00:18:39,570
you know why I should really do this,

608
00:18:39,571 --> 00:18:40,404
but you don't.

609
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,800
It's like so I had this idea a long
time ago because the world is a pretty

610
00:18:43,801 --> 00:18:44,611
dreadful place.

611
00:18:44,611 --> 00:18:45,001
I thought,

612
00:18:45,001 --> 00:18:45,540
well,

613
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:49,710
what would the world be like if people
stopped avoiding the things they knew

614
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:50,544
they should do?

615
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:51,170
You know?

616
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:56,170
Guess the question is how much are we
contributing to the fact that life is a,

617
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,860
is an existential
catastrophe and a tragedy?

618
00:18:58,861 --> 00:19:01,920
How much is our own corruption
contributing to that?

619
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:06,510
How to really worthwhile question the
things you leave undone because you're

620
00:19:06,511 --> 00:19:06,931
angry,

621
00:19:06,931 --> 00:19:07,621
you're resentful,

622
00:19:07,621 --> 00:19:08,191
you're lazy,

623
00:19:08,191 --> 00:19:09,024
you have a neuro Shia,

624
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:11,850
well you consult your
conscience and it says,

625
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:12,061
well,

626
00:19:12,061 --> 00:19:12,820
you know,

627
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:13,730
got a place over there,

628
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,730
could use a little work.

629
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,490
It's the same as working on yourself.

630
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:19,440
And so you clean that up because you can,

631
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:23,970
and then things are a little clearer
around you and you're a little better off

632
00:19:23,971 --> 00:19:27,030
because you've practiced a bit and
and so you're a little stronger.

633
00:19:27,031 --> 00:19:29,220
And then something else
manifest itself and says,

634
00:19:29,221 --> 00:19:32,190
well maybe you could like take
a crack at fixing me up too.

635
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:35,550
So he decided to do that and then
that gets a little bit more pristine,

636
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:36,311
you know,

637
00:19:36,311 --> 00:19:37,144
when soon.

638
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:37,861
And it's,

639
00:19:37,861 --> 00:19:41,430
it's humble because you're not
exceeding your domain of competence.

640
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,540
You know,

641
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,110
it's like,

642
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,760
don't be fixing up the economy.

643
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:45,660
18 year old,

644
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,330
you don't know anything about the economy.

645
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:52,290
It's a massive complex machine
beyond anyone's understanding.

646
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,240
And you mess with it at your peril.

647
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:57,090
So when can you even
clean up your own room?

648
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,073
No.

649
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,690
Well you should think about that.

650
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:05,490
You should think about that because if
you can't even clean up your own room,

651
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,010
who the hell are you to
give advice to the world?

652
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:09,600
And in the morning,

653
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:10,710
this hooker,

654
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,543
um,

655
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,880
she just tells me like,

656
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:13,350
how much,

657
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,290
how much I owe her.

658
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:14,681
Right.

659
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:15,101
And I'm like,

660
00:20:15,101 --> 00:20:16,390
that's fucking outrageous.

661
00:20:16,391 --> 00:20:17,590
There's no fucking way I was,

662
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:18,221
I'd say it was like,

663
00:20:18,221 --> 00:20:18,940
basically,

664
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:22,870
I don't care if you're a fucking pimp
wants to kick my ass and fucking kill me.

665
00:20:22,871 --> 00:20:26,740
I'm not paying that fucking much much for,

666
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,300
I forget it was so long ago.

667
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,141
But,

668
00:20:29,141 --> 00:20:29,974
um,

669
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:30,731
but yeah,

670
00:20:30,731 --> 00:20:33,580
I was outraged beforehand.

671
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:34,600
It just,

672
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,340
it just wasn't in that case.

673
00:20:36,341 --> 00:20:36,821
I exactly,

674
00:20:36,821 --> 00:20:37,720
I remember clearly,

675
00:20:37,721 --> 00:20:38,290
I was like,

676
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:39,101
what do you want that much?

677
00:20:39,101 --> 00:20:39,730
And I said,

678
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:40,120
I said,

679
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,110
I'll give you this much.

680
00:20:41,111 --> 00:20:43,270
And that's how much he get what period?

681
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,360
And we,

682
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:44,570
we,

683
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:44,891
we,

684
00:20:44,891 --> 00:20:45,641
we came out,

685
00:20:45,641 --> 00:20:45,911
right?

686
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:46,151
Like,

687
00:20:46,151 --> 00:20:46,770
um,

688
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:46,961
you know,

689
00:20:46,961 --> 00:20:49,060
I got to go film and uh,

690
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:49,940
well I can through,

691
00:20:49,941 --> 00:20:50,774
uh,

692
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:51,110
the,

693
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:53,800
the lobby Knoxville is down
there having breakfast.

694
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:56,290
This hooker comes
walking by and knocks on.

695
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:57,124
She says,

696
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,360
that's not steevo.

697
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,530
That's cheapo.

698
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,380
That would be the scientific approach.

699
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,753
I don't know what it is.

700
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,361
Great mystery.

701
00:21:07,361 --> 00:21:10,120
Let's just wait and see versus a,

702
00:21:10,121 --> 00:21:12,310
I'm going to postulate
a lost civilization.

703
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,330
Nothing wrong with that Graham.

704
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,590
It's a free country.

705
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:15,040
Uh,

706
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,890
and scientists do this all the time as,

707
00:21:16,891 --> 00:21:17,770
as you've mentioned,

708
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,810
there's a rather humorous thing,

709
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,130
which I have to say actually,

710
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,830
I'm not even ask Jamie to pull up the,

711
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,753
um,

712
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,440
the a couple of images.

713
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,540
I mean this is embarrassing.

714
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:34,680
I remember telling my parents
that I wanted to change my name to

715
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,890
Damien Monroe,

716
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:46,010
crystal Leah to Damien,

717
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:50,710
Damien Monroe because
Damien was is the devil,

718
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,071
right?

719
00:21:51,071 --> 00:21:51,550
Okay.

720
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:54,580
And then Marilyn Monroe
was like pure in my head.

721
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:55,181
So I was like,

722
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:56,140
you have both.

723
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,190
I would ask my parents,

724
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:57,430
I would,

725
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:58,001
I would ask my peers,

726
00:21:58,001 --> 00:22:00,940
because I always sat like this at
the dinner table and I asked him,

727
00:22:00,941 --> 00:22:01,600
I was like,

728
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:01,901
I was like,

729
00:22:01,901 --> 00:22:03,190
can you call me crazy legs?

730
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,560
And I remember thinking like,

731
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:08,921
oh,

732
00:22:08,921 --> 00:22:10,240
like that would be cool.

733
00:22:10,241 --> 00:22:11,980
Like if my family called me crazy legs,

734
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,570
it's Damien crazy legs coming at Ya.

735
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:16,410
And then they were like,

736
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:17,141
and my dad was like,

737
00:22:17,141 --> 00:22:17,830
no.

738
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:18,420
And I was like,

739
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,800
but just like maybe just at
least at the dinner table,

740
00:22:20,801 --> 00:22:23,110
I remember saying that and you'd be like,

741
00:22:23,111 --> 00:22:24,970
I'm not fucking calling you crazy leg.

742
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:25,340
We need you,

743
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,060
Chris,

744
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,880
you were talking about tiger
woods and your podcast.

745
00:22:27,881 --> 00:22:30,340
I was listening to on the way over
here and I totally agree with you.

746
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:32,590
Are you saying like when
tigers world fell apart?

747
00:22:32,591 --> 00:22:33,730
Like how the fuck do you know?

748
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:34,960
Like what do you,

749
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,760
did you talk to him
like you don't know him?

750
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:37,031
You know,

751
00:22:37,031 --> 00:22:37,540
that was,

752
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:37,810
I mean,

753
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:38,950
that's just a bunch of hype.

754
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,820
Like for him,

755
00:22:39,821 --> 00:22:41,170
it's like a double dump though,

756
00:22:41,171 --> 00:22:41,531
you know?

757
00:22:41,531 --> 00:22:41,831
I mean,

758
00:22:41,831 --> 00:22:45,400
the thing happens personally with his
personal life and it happens publicly

759
00:22:45,401 --> 00:22:46,360
where everybody gets to see it.

760
00:22:46,361 --> 00:22:47,290
And then on top of that,

761
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:50,010
his body's falling apart at the
same time no matter what he did.

762
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:50,480
Yeah.

763
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:50,891
No matter what.

764
00:22:50,891 --> 00:22:52,300
You're going to church every fucking week.

765
00:22:52,301 --> 00:22:54,250
He was going to fuck up his
back and his knees and they,

766
00:22:54,251 --> 00:22:54,731
and it did,

767
00:22:54,731 --> 00:22:56,470
but then they're trying to equate it to,

768
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,333
uh,

769
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:58,600
you know,

770
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:58,900
whatever.

771
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,030
The,

772
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,910
I'd say what he did was
none of my business,

773
00:23:00,911 --> 00:23:02,050
it's none of my fucking business.

774
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,340
I don't want to know about it.

775
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:04,270
I hate no one about,

776
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:05,140
you know,

777
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,420
I feel bad if somebody like,

778
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:08,320
if the marriage falls apart,

779
00:23:08,321 --> 00:23:09,600
I feel bad if they get busted for drugs,

780
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,121
you know,

781
00:23:10,121 --> 00:23:10,840
I mean,

782
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,640
it happens if you fucked
up and it's your fault,

783
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:13,211
you should get punched.

784
00:23:13,211 --> 00:23:15,010
But like the cops are handling it.

785
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,030
They arrested him.

786
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,560
The courts will handle it.

787
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:18,820
Do I?

788
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,710
Do I need to talk to,

789
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,390
I need to pile on and start wagging my
fucking hypocrite and a finger at them.

790
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:27,090
It's so immediate that you become this,

791
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:28,030
you become other,

792
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,180
you become an outsider.

793
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,940
Like in the next morning
when he went back,

794
00:23:30,941 --> 00:23:32,950
I rang the doorbell.

795
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,550
I rang the doorbell to your own house
and I lived in that house from the day I

796
00:23:36,551 --> 00:23:37,360
was born.

797
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,200
Whoa.

798
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,480
So you felt like you had
to ring the doorbell.

799
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,010
If this is not my world anymore.

800
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:43,790
Wow.

801
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,290
Like,

802
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:45,410
why don't you ring the doorbell?

803
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,850
And it was like,

804
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:47,120
there's,

805
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:47,953
there's no other,

806
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:48,860
there is,

807
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,050
there is nothing else like it.

808
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,040
This is not our home.

809
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:51,883
This is not.

810
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:52,760
So we go and,

811
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,001
you know,

812
00:23:53,001 --> 00:23:54,770
we're packing all of our things.

813
00:23:54,771 --> 00:23:55,370
It was just,

814
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:56,000
it was awful.

815
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,250
Just,

816
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,083
uh,

817
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,540
I had been in those four months,

818
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:01,160
I had been so terrified of,

819
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,320
because I know knowing what was coming,

820
00:24:03,321 --> 00:24:07,040
like just imagine you're going
to lose everyone in your life.

821
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,361
They're just,

822
00:24:08,361 --> 00:24:09,350
you're just going to like,

823
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:13,220
you're not going to like how your
parents met and fell in love.

824
00:24:13,221 --> 00:24:18,221
Or like your grandparents and family
recipes and photos and memories and what

825
00:24:18,321 --> 00:24:18,921
did the House looks?

826
00:24:18,921 --> 00:24:22,190
I'm like taking photos and voice
recordings and just all the time,

827
00:24:22,191 --> 00:24:23,390
like an every,

828
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:24,501
it was just,

829
00:24:24,501 --> 00:24:24,801
it's just,

830
00:24:24,801 --> 00:24:25,610
it's overwhelming.

831
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:26,443
It's just,

832
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,433
um,

833
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,250
so when you say something like,

834
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:31,731
well,

835
00:24:31,731 --> 00:24:32,001
you know,

836
00:24:32,001 --> 00:24:33,400
we should be attacking Islam.

837
00:24:33,401 --> 00:24:36,590
Islam as if it's something
that is outside of Islam.

838
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,180
That's simply false.

839
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:38,751
Islam.

840
00:24:38,751 --> 00:24:39,800
Islam is Islam,

841
00:24:39,801 --> 00:24:40,370
right?

842
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:40,641
Ird,

843
00:24:40,641 --> 00:24:41,300
the one,

844
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,130
the prime minister of Turkey,

845
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,960
and I can quote many other,

846
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:45,890
uh,

847
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:48,110
Islamic experts said,

848
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:49,400
Islam is Islam,

849
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,790
the term moderate Islam,

850
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,201
Islam,

851
00:24:51,201 --> 00:24:51,471
Islam,

852
00:24:51,471 --> 00:24:54,020
and all these other
qualifiers are nonsensical.

853
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:59,510
And now the reason why that upsets me is
because it grants people a false sense

854
00:24:59,691 --> 00:25:01,460
of security and hope,

855
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:01,910
you know,

856
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,260
Islam is wonderful,

857
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,440
but we need to attack this
separate thing called Islamism.

858
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:07,010
Well,

859
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:07,910
from day one,

860
00:25:07,911 --> 00:25:09,200
1400 years ago,

861
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:10,730
Islam was Islamism.

862
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:11,061
Now,

863
00:25:11,061 --> 00:25:12,950
that doesn't mean that there
isn't a spiritual element.

864
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:17,360
That doesn't mean that most Muslims just
want to practice the spiritual part,

865
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:22,900
but there is no set of doctrines in a
separate book called radicalized Islamism.

866
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,210
It all comes from the same texts.

867
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:27,350
It comes from the Quran,

868
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,540
it comes from the Hedis,

869
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,770
and it comes from the Sera,

870
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,920
the biography of Muhammad.

871
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:31,880
So,

872
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:36,880
so this kind of false narrative that
people are promulgating so that they seem

873
00:25:36,981 --> 00:25:41,600
as though they're not frontally
attacking a religion while laudable.

874
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:42,291
While Nice,

875
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:44,000
I get that reflex.

876
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,080
It's false.

877
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:47,690
I don't know if I talked
about my dad with you,

878
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:47,901
but,

879
00:25:47,901 --> 00:25:48,260
um,

880
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,570
he was my wrestling coach in high school.

881
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:51,110
Uh,

882
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,070
he was also my,

883
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:53,180
uh,

884
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:53,751
earth science,

885
00:25:53,751 --> 00:25:56,300
biology and environmental studies teacher.

886
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:57,590
She was my teacher.

887
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,970
I want to drag you went to school,

888
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,480
your dad being the tea does fucking,

889
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:03,470
I learned a lot because he was no joke.

890
00:26:03,471 --> 00:26:05,150
He didn't pull any punches for me.

891
00:26:05,151 --> 00:26:05,451
He,

892
00:26:05,451 --> 00:26:05,691
you know,

893
00:26:05,691 --> 00:26:06,830
he drove me as hard,

894
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:10,640
if not harder than his other students
who didn't show any favoritism.

895
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:11,961
But one of the things,

896
00:26:11,961 --> 00:26:13,520
it was always his thing on the mat,

897
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,200
and I'm kind of paraphrasing,

898
00:26:15,201 --> 00:26:17,240
but basically you,

899
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,820
you either win or you learn.

900
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,110
Uh,

901
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,400
especially in that high school,

902
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:23,240
college setting,

903
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:23,450
you're,

904
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:24,230
you're,

905
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:25,370
you're learning about yourself.

906
00:26:25,371 --> 00:26:25,641
If you,

907
00:26:25,641 --> 00:26:30,260
if you went out there and you got your
ass handed to you and you just got bead

908
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,850
and didn't learn anything,

909
00:26:31,851 --> 00:26:32,151
well yeah,

910
00:26:32,151 --> 00:26:33,080
you're a fucking loser.

911
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:34,790
Take the moment,

912
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,290
reflect on it,

913
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,670
build on what you did wrong and you now
you're actually in a way you've won.

914
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:42,500
You've now you know more about yourself.

915
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,021
You know about more your,

916
00:26:44,021 --> 00:26:48,540
your limitations are what you need to
improve and expand your talents are your

917
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:49,141
limitations.

918
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:51,990
So I guess whenever I'm doing a thing,

919
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:55,470
I'm always looking at it
from a learning perspective.

920
00:26:55,471 --> 00:27:00,300
So there aren't necessarily
mistakes unless they're
fatal and then wouldn't know

921
00:27:00,301 --> 00:27:00,661
anyway.

922
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:02,040
So whatever.

923
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,800
Cause you see him in a club and he sees,

924
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,870
he sees some girls.

925
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:06,243
How are you doing?

926
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,173
Like BMW,

927
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:09,080
when girls go,

928
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:09,690
what do you like?

929
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:10,431
You like BMW,

930
00:27:10,431 --> 00:27:11,120
like cars,

931
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,590
like BMWs and crazy.

932
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:15,020
He'd take the girls out and go get a BMW.

933
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:15,501
Ah,

934
00:27:15,501 --> 00:27:17,000
there was another guy
standing on the wall,

935
00:27:17,001 --> 00:27:17,930
green jacket,

936
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:20,060
like green little jumpsuit.

937
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,520
Nobody's talking to him.

938
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,710
Guess who was who?

939
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,130
Jay Z.

940
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:27,130
Nobody

941
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:27,460
knew.

942
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:27,660
I said,

943
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,493
what's up man?

944
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,280
He's just a great party.

945
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:35,880
Cause it wasn't too long after
that accident that he had,

946
00:27:35,881 --> 00:27:36,510
right.

947
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:37,240
And then he goes,

948
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:37,810
ah,

949
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:38,430
I,

950
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:40,680
I got a song dat,

951
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,300
Dat,

952
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:41,890
you,

953
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:43,170
you will be gut on.

954
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,253
Uh,

955
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:45,570
I got the song.

956
00:27:45,571 --> 00:27:46,830
I know you could kill it.

957
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:47,131
I was like,

958
00:27:47,131 --> 00:27:48,510
me song,

959
00:27:48,511 --> 00:27:49,380
goofy face.

960
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,591
I called Robert.

961
00:27:52,591 --> 00:27:52,771
I said,

962
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:53,071
listen,

963
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:54,420
I need you to play a Mexican.

964
00:27:54,421 --> 00:27:54,990
He says,

965
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:55,680
dude,

966
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,513
here's the deal.

967
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:58,681
Why not fuck it?

968
00:27:58,681 --> 00:27:59,070
Sure,

969
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,480
of course you're Mexican.

970
00:28:00,481 --> 00:28:01,090
Whatever.

971
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:02,620
I did an Adam Sandler film.

972
00:28:02,621 --> 00:28:03,191
I don't know that,

973
00:28:03,191 --> 00:28:03,490
that,

974
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:03,790
that,

975
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:04,600
uh,

976
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,810
the last one he did the
Sandy Wexler and you know,

977
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:08,830
you go up on the set,

978
00:28:08,831 --> 00:28:09,071
you know,

979
00:28:09,071 --> 00:28:11,260
an Adam starring in this film and I'm not,

980
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,161
you know what I mean?

981
00:28:12,161 --> 00:28:13,830
And I used to star in films and it's,

982
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,970
it's a weird feeling for me.

983
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:19,780
Like I'm happy to be on the set and I
love Adam and he's an old dear friend and

984
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,370
I'm super happy for him,

985
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,170
but I was starring in films,

986
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:24,400
you know what I mean?

987
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,480
Everywhere I go,

988
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,111
people say,

989
00:28:26,111 --> 00:28:27,640
why aren't you starting in films?

990
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:28,181
Like,

991
00:28:28,181 --> 00:28:28,471
what?

992
00:28:28,471 --> 00:28:29,201
What's up?

993
00:28:29,201 --> 00:28:31,030
And I can't answer it,

994
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,170
you know what I mean?

995
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,280
Poor choices.

996
00:28:33,281 --> 00:28:34,091
The weasel shit,

997
00:28:34,091 --> 00:28:34,924
dry it up.

998
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,100
Um,

999
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:36,301
you know,

1000
00:28:36,301 --> 00:28:37,900
the movies didn't perform as well.

1001
00:28:37,901 --> 00:28:39,190
I didn't listen to my agents.

1002
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,840
I wasn't like doing drugs.

1003
00:28:40,841 --> 00:28:41,381
It wasn't like,

1004
00:28:41,381 --> 00:28:41,501
oh,

1005
00:28:41,501 --> 00:28:42,520
got all fucked up.

1006
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:45,910
It's just one movie didn't do so good.

1007
00:28:45,911 --> 00:28:49,420
Then the next thing that we didn't do
so good and then they eventually just

1008
00:28:49,421 --> 00:28:51,100
stopped coming and he told us about money,

1009
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:51,950
shit,

1010
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:52,210
uh,

1011
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:54,070
in his backyard and somebody
thought it was a Baird.

1012
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,713
She would leave.

1013
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:05,950
She will let her dogs out every day
and then she would clean up people.

1014
00:29:05,951 --> 00:29:06,731
French poodles,

1015
00:29:06,731 --> 00:29:07,780
when you shit outside,

1016
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,490
it's not going to be a decent shit.

1017
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,140
It's going to be like explosive.

1018
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,900
So when I got up,

1019
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,420
it looks like somebody got shot
in the head that we should all

1020
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:21,940
French poodles Chihuahuas and
she's looking at the wall like,

1021
00:29:22,481 --> 00:29:23,390
what the fuck happened?

1022
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:28,850
All of a sudden she actually walks up
close to it and squint and looks down on

1023
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:31,230
it and looks around and runs in the house.

1024
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:32,740
I'm watching all this.

1025
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:33,693
I can't breathe.

1026
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:35,120
Oh my God.

1027
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:40,000
I took a shit in favor in his backyard
after a five hour drive from Colton or

1028
00:29:40,001 --> 00:29:40,840
some weird town,

1029
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:45,220
did not talk to you after that for awhile
I took a shit and then he ran over it

1030
00:29:45,221 --> 00:29:47,170
with his car and the whole back yard,

1031
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,190
smelly sewage waste.

1032
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:50,080
I'd go with her the next day.

1033
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:51,303
He goes,

1034
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,660
it smells back here.

1035
00:29:52,661 --> 00:29:53,530
Let's walk in the house.

1036
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,340
I don't know what happened and
you can see the brown shit.

1037
00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:01,930
You smashed it with this
tire and a bunch of flies

1038
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:08,640
to talk to me for a month after
that in some of these backyard

1039
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,880
because I told him the truth.

1040
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,230
I felt bad.

1041
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:15,460
I lied to the guy.

1042
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,600
I remember I was telling
you guys at one time,

1043
00:30:17,601 --> 00:30:18,351
my freshman year,

1044
00:30:18,351 --> 00:30:19,900
I didn't take a ship for a week and I had,

1045
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,060
I used to,

1046
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,140
I was addicted to steak,

1047
00:30:22,141 --> 00:30:22,974
comes with American.

1048
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,390
Jeez and all right.

1049
00:30:24,391 --> 00:30:25,224
A French brothers,

1050
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:26,723
listen to me.

1051
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:27,580
How long is that?

1052
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:29,933
I was in,

1053
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:34,910
I played freshman ball and we
were playing Paddison east side.

1054
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:37,070
That's just a jungle of the school.

1055
00:30:37,071 --> 00:30:38,750
Like you gotta be careful
when you're in there.

1056
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:41,570
And uh,

1057
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:43,250
we went there to play
the Christmas tournament,

1058
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:46,680
but what kind of ball
are we talking about?

1059
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:50,600
Basketball and I hadn't taken a
shift from like 10 days or something.

1060
00:30:50,601 --> 00:30:51,351
I took acid,

1061
00:30:51,351 --> 00:30:52,570
something to fuck my stomach up.

1062
00:30:52,571 --> 00:30:53,630
I didn't tell nobody.

1063
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,770
And those days I was really scared of
doctors and I wouldn't say shit to nobody.

1064
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:58,970
No Way.

1065
00:30:58,970 --> 00:30:59,181
Home.

1066
00:30:59,181 --> 00:31:00,050
We got on the bus

1067
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,770
and while we were waiting there,

1068
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:06,530
my stomach started hurting and I said,

1069
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,430
Jesus Christ,

1070
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,950
I don't know if I'm going
to shoot myself a Fart,

1071
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,600
but let me just take a chance,

1072
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,790
and I blew this far.

1073
00:31:13,791 --> 00:31:14,624
Joe Rogan.

1074
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,490
That was so bad,

1075
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:17,690
right?

1076
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:19,610
We want a bus and people started running,

1077
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:20,720
you know the school buses,

1078
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,820
people started running to the window,

1079
00:31:22,821 --> 00:31:25,460
goes right to swing down the bus windows,

1080
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:27,050
but here's what you got by the,

1081
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:30,110
I fathered again as the
teachers would going,

1082
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:30,771
oh my God,

1083
00:31:30,771 --> 00:31:31,780
he's changing flavors.

1084
00:31:31,781 --> 00:31:32,614
Yeah.

1085
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,710
What's the worst thing was
the cheerleaders are crying.

1086
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:41,830
That's how bad they were
sitting in front of a bus

1087
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:47,420
or the teachers yell.

1088
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:50,851
There's a building.

1089
00:31:50,851 --> 00:31:54,720
It's still there on Franklin and Hollywood
where Charles Manson used to live and

1090
00:31:54,721 --> 00:31:56,550
run his or is out of,

1091
00:31:56,551 --> 00:31:57,660
which I didn't know he was doing.

1092
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:58,360
He was a pimp,

1093
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:02,010
yet pimping girls to people that
are staying at the Roosevelt color.

1094
00:32:02,011 --> 00:32:02,461
Me Badd.

1095
00:32:02,461 --> 00:32:03,294
Right.

1096
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:06,940
Let me,

1097
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:07,990
mine is

1098
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,920
perfect color.

1099
00:32:10,921 --> 00:32:11,910
Me Badd to Bam,

1100
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:12,983
like you know,

1101
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:16,350
it's a hard one to learn but anything
that's got an orgasm at the end of it,

1102
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:16,760
you know,

1103
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,170
there's a degree of pleasure
to be had but it takes,

1104
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:22,470
it takes a while to recognize or what
they see the emotional cost of me to

1105
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,030
spiritual cost on other people.

1106
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,550
The fact that it's preventing
me from becoming a father,

1107
00:32:26,551 --> 00:32:27,600
from becoming a husband,

1108
00:32:27,601 --> 00:32:28,600
from set Ellyn,

1109
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:29,700
from becoming rooted,

1110
00:32:29,701 --> 00:32:31,350
from becoming actually whole,

1111
00:32:31,351 --> 00:32:32,340
from becoming a man,

1112
00:32:32,341 --> 00:32:33,510
from becoming connected.

1113
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,370
And it takes a while to spot that.

1114
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:38,490
I think a lot of people don't get the
opportunity to break out that pattern.

1115
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:42,010
I would never have spotted it had a not
first being a heroin addict and going

1116
00:32:42,011 --> 00:32:42,501
hold on a minute,

1117
00:32:42,501 --> 00:32:43,640
you're doing that thing again.

1118
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:45,770
Same with fame and celebrity.

1119
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,090
Well toxic,

1120
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,080
well toxic,

1121
00:32:48,081 --> 00:32:50,300
exciting and brilliant and
loads of lovely people in there.

1122
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,140
And I still like,

1123
00:32:51,141 --> 00:32:51,321
you know,

1124
00:32:51,321 --> 00:32:52,280
I might make another film,

1125
00:32:52,281 --> 00:32:56,480
I don't know what happened but like
it's because I'd had the template and

1126
00:32:56,481 --> 00:32:57,530
experiences of awe,

1127
00:32:57,531 --> 00:32:58,420
this is addiction.

1128
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:00,500
You're expecting this
thing to make you feel bad.

1129
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,060
Harvey's and Executive Guy,

1130
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:02,810
right.

1131
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:03,010
Guy,

1132
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:06,500
the money guy behind everything and
a coke and caviar and suck my dick

1133
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,820
is so nasty.

1134
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:11,683
So gross.

1135
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:12,051
Okay.

1136
00:33:12,051 --> 00:33:13,370
Now on the other hand,

1137
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:14,780
on the other hand,

1138
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:15,470
I was like,

1139
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:15,891
you know,

1140
00:33:15,891 --> 00:33:20,000
Hollywood is such a labyrinth in terms
of like getting shit done and getting

1141
00:33:20,001 --> 00:33:20,751
deals closed.

1142
00:33:20,751 --> 00:33:21,291
And how did this,

1143
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:22,124
does this happen?

1144
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,500
It would kind of be nice to be like,

1145
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,910
you want a Netflix special?

1146
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,140
Just go fucking suck.

1147
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,780
And then I can be like,

1148
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:29,931
oh,

1149
00:33:29,931 --> 00:33:31,250
that's all I have to do is suck.

1150
00:33:31,251 --> 00:33:31,910
And that guys,

1151
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:32,210
yeah,

1152
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:32,721
come over here.

1153
00:33:32,721 --> 00:33:33,231
You Nasty.

1154
00:33:33,231 --> 00:33:33,471
Fuck.

1155
00:33:33,471 --> 00:33:35,270
And then there's your special,

1156
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:36,660
right.

1157
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,370
You know what if you type in,

1158
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:39,540
um,

1159
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,110
Astra,

1160
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:40,943
uh,

1161
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,230
the tr three be astro,

1162
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:44,130
tr three B

1163
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:47,481
and I'll walk over.

1164
00:33:47,481 --> 00:33:48,430
They kind of walk over there for a second.

1165
00:33:48,431 --> 00:33:48,530
Sure,

1166
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:49,363
sure.

1167
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,213
Go ahead.

1168
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:51,830
This is Mike gone to,

1169
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:52,560
yeah.

1170
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,520
So we can all talk to each other.

1171
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:54,160
Sure.

1172
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:54,480
No.

1173
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,500
So what you want to do is
come down here and do your,

1174
00:33:58,590 --> 00:33:59,420
your people get to,

1175
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,180
uh,

1176
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:00,970
there'll be able to see it.

1177
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:02,010
We'll put it up on the screen.

1178
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,051
So what,

1179
00:34:04,051 --> 00:34:05,040
what this is,

1180
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:06,603
um,

1181
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:08,160
well I don't really want
to tell you what it is.

1182
00:34:08,161 --> 00:34:09,240
What I want you to watch it yet.

1183
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:11,730
Is this,

1184
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:12,563
that's not it.

1185
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:13,530
One more page.

1186
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:14,660
I'll find it for you.

1187
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,020
Just takes me a second.

1188
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,720
There's a bunch of bullshit.

1189
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,170
This is the craft by the way.

1190
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:22,740
And did you spell it right?

1191
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:24,001
Astro.

1192
00:34:24,001 --> 00:34:24,361
That's why.

1193
00:34:24,361 --> 00:34:25,194
Sorry.

1194
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,060
Astra.

1195
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:26,230
Oh,

1196
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,410
Astra Astra not astro.

1197
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:28,631
Yeah,

1198
00:34:28,631 --> 00:34:29,464
you're typing it.

1199
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,180
You just got to get,

1200
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:32,611
we've got to get,

1201
00:34:32,611 --> 00:34:33,444
make sure it's the right one.

1202
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:38,600
So the hundred mile race that I was
doing a month before Moab add about,

1203
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,000
I mean 12 miles roughly
to the finish line.

1204
00:34:42,001 --> 00:34:45,000
My vision started blurring
like in the periphery.

1205
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:45,781
Um,

1206
00:34:45,781 --> 00:34:50,781
and over the course of the next couple
of miles closed in until it was pure

1207
00:34:51,361 --> 00:34:51,840
white.

1208
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,730
I couldn't see anything pretty much.

1209
00:34:53,731 --> 00:34:55,980
I would say like 98% blind.

1210
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:56,760
What?

1211
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,460
I could see my feet like
right in front of my feet.

1212
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:01,200
But it was just white out.

1213
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:02,930
When people heard about this,

1214
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,600
like they're like problem with
like click bait journalism.

1215
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,650
The headlines look like I was,

1216
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,210
it's like sexual misconduct stuff.

1217
00:35:08,211 --> 00:35:08,840
And like,

1218
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,810
I don't want to be like,

1219
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,753
but like,

1220
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,510
uh,

1221
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,530
let me just stop you right here.

1222
00:35:12,531 --> 00:35:13,670
If you say like one more time,

1223
00:35:13,671 --> 00:35:15,260
I fucking head's gonna explode dude.

1224
00:35:15,261 --> 00:35:16,160
I get comments like that.

1225
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,030
It's brutal.

1226
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:17,520
Isabella,

1227
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,830
is it as bad as all right.

1228
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,870
I just want you to slow it down.

1229
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,500
I'm going to use it every now and then.

1230
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:23,850
This coffee break,

1231
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,450
you're breaking the like the like meter

1232
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:27,041
and I,

1233
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:28,430
I'm not stupid.

1234
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:29,990
And so I said to myself,

1235
00:35:29,991 --> 00:35:31,700
stop stuttering now.

1236
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:33,350
Stop Stuttering now.

1237
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:37,860
I said that dozens hundreds of
times over and over and over.

1238
00:35:37,861 --> 00:35:42,861
And fortunately the storms went past
and held onto the tree and soaking wet.

1239
00:35:43,411 --> 00:35:48,411
I came out of the tree and walked back
to where I was living and then the next

1240
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,250
day I got up,

1241
00:35:50,251 --> 00:35:52,470
I didn't see anybody and I was walking on,

1242
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,040
on,

1243
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:57,810
on this path and a sidewalk and there's
a lady that I really liked a lot and uh,

1244
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,350
but she was always attracted to the
super self assured jocks and things like

1245
00:36:01,351 --> 00:36:01,561
that.

1246
00:36:01,561 --> 00:36:03,750
She was actually very kind and sweet,

1247
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:08,430
but I didn't want to stare at her
in the eyes because I would stutter.

1248
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,680
And it's humiliating for us.

1249
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:13,860
So the more humiliating
us stutterers feel,

1250
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,390
the more we stutter.

1251
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:18,090
And so it's a really slippery slope.

1252
00:36:18,091 --> 00:36:20,160
And so I would avoid eye contact.

1253
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:24,150
And so for the first time
she walked towards him,

1254
00:36:24,151 --> 00:36:24,450
he says,

1255
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:24,871
good morning,

1256
00:36:24,871 --> 00:36:25,141
Paul,

1257
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:25,651
how are you?

1258
00:36:25,651 --> 00:36:29,400
She was always so nice to me and I was
terrified because I'd embarrass myself.

1259
00:36:29,401 --> 00:36:30,780
And I looked at her straight in the eyes.

1260
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:31,560
I said,

1261
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,341
I'm doing fine.

1262
00:36:32,341 --> 00:36:33,174
How are you?

1263
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:35,430
And I stopped stuttering in one day.

1264
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:36,720
Whoa.

1265
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,280
And this speaks to now what was been
medically proven is that we can reset the

1266
00:36:41,281 --> 00:36:44,250
neurology of the human
brain through neurogenesis.

1267
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:49,580
I believe that experience allowed me
to map new neurological pathways that

1268
00:36:49,711 --> 00:36:52,620
allows me to elocute in a way
that I could not elocute before.

1269
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,360
Used to hang out a lot with Dennis.

1270
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:54,780
Uh,

1271
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,260
and uh,

1272
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,070
you know,

1273
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,450
hadn't seen him for years,

1274
00:36:57,451 --> 00:37:00,000
was at a restaurant in
Chicago not too long ago.

1275
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:00,901
And,

1276
00:37:00,901 --> 00:37:01,734
um,

1277
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:03,210
and somebody said,

1278
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:03,780
oh,

1279
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:04,770
you guys are friends with Dennis,

1280
00:37:04,771 --> 00:37:05,011
right?

1281
00:37:05,011 --> 00:37:05,201
Yeah,

1282
00:37:05,201 --> 00:37:05,700
yeah.

1283
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:05,821
Oh,

1284
00:37:05,821 --> 00:37:06,660
he's upstairs.

1285
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:07,201
Oh really?

1286
00:37:07,201 --> 00:37:07,741
We go upstairs,

1287
00:37:07,741 --> 00:37:08,670
Dennis crying.

1288
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,151
Oh my God.

1289
00:37:09,151 --> 00:37:09,984
I miss you guys.

1290
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:12,690
Me and my buddy were
hanging out with them.

1291
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:13,561
Talent,

1292
00:37:13,561 --> 00:37:14,311
old stories,

1293
00:37:14,311 --> 00:37:14,521
you know,

1294
00:37:14,521 --> 00:37:15,331
seven or eight years,

1295
00:37:15,331 --> 00:37:16,164
haven't seen him.

1296
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:16,740
This is great.

1297
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:16,951
Like,

1298
00:37:16,951 --> 00:37:17,190
uh,

1299
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:21,630
when you see a buddy you really love and
it's really affectionate and Dennis is

1300
00:37:21,631 --> 00:37:22,321
one of those people.

1301
00:37:22,321 --> 00:37:24,120
At some point he just gets
up and he wanders away.

1302
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,130
I think he's going to take a piss.

1303
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:26,740
Okay.

1304
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:27,870
But 10 minutes goes by,

1305
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,190
I say to the waitress.

1306
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,120
To Dennis leave.

1307
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:30,331
Yeah,

1308
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,164
he left.

1309
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:31,860
Okay.

1310
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:32,790
I just figured he's gone.

1311
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:33,780
It's just the way he is.

1312
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,190
Right.

1313
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,023
He wouldn't even say goodbye.

1314
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:35,903
Just gone.

1315
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,160
I get up the next morning
I turned the television,

1316
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,870
Dennis Rodman's in North Korea.

1317
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:42,853
Okay.

1318
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:43,320
I,

1319
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:43,621
by the way,

1320
00:37:43,621 --> 00:37:44,970
I spent an hour and a half with them.

1321
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:45,571
He didn't say anything.

1322
00:37:45,571 --> 00:37:46,590
We go about going to North Korea.

1323
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,240
As I turned the television,

1324
00:37:48,241 --> 00:37:50,010
it's like very controversial.

1325
00:37:50,011 --> 00:37:51,120
Dennis Rodman to North Korea.

1326
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,390
So I text my buddy and I say,

1327
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,790
have you seen the news?

1328
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:57,511
No.

1329
00:37:57,511 --> 00:37:58,344
What?

1330
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:00,150
I say turn on the television.

1331
00:38:00,151 --> 00:38:00,541
And he said,

1332
00:38:00,541 --> 00:38:01,081
what channel?

1333
00:38:01,081 --> 00:38:01,381
I said,

1334
00:38:01,381 --> 00:38:02,310
it doesn't matter.

1335
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:05,370
And two minutes goes by.

1336
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,420
Holy Fuck.

1337
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,400
Cause he went through the same thing,

1338
00:38:08,401 --> 00:38:09,234
you know,

1339
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,210
and the radio program director
came into my town knew,

1340
00:38:12,211 --> 00:38:13,530
and you know if you've ever been in radio,

1341
00:38:13,531 --> 00:38:14,370
when they come into town,

1342
00:38:14,371 --> 00:38:16,440
knew the first thing they're going to do
is change everything cause they got to

1343
00:38:16,441 --> 00:38:18,180
put their own stamp on
it or why are they there?

1344
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,690
So this guy comes in and he goes,

1345
00:38:19,691 --> 00:38:21,270
well we're going to rebrand you.

1346
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:21,781
He goes,

1347
00:38:21,781 --> 00:38:25,260
I want everyone to think of your name
and instantly think of the brand and I'm

1348
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:25,621
already,

1349
00:38:25,621 --> 00:38:25,951
you know,

1350
00:38:25,951 --> 00:38:26,460
brand.

1351
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:26,671
Yeah.

1352
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:26,911
Okay.

1353
00:38:26,911 --> 00:38:27,721
So here's what he said.

1354
00:38:27,721 --> 00:38:30,960
So I hate to say this because this will
become a meme online that I will have to

1355
00:38:30,961 --> 00:38:31,820
live with the rest of it.

1356
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,210
But it's an absolutely true story.

1357
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,290
So the guy says to me,

1358
00:38:34,291 --> 00:38:34,531
he goes,

1359
00:38:34,531 --> 00:38:37,900
listen all a imagine a
billboard that says Dan Carlin,

1360
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:38,920
he fucks chickens.

1361
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:40,001
And I said,

1362
00:38:40,001 --> 00:38:40,541
excuse me?

1363
00:38:40,541 --> 00:38:40,811
He goes,

1364
00:38:40,811 --> 00:38:40,991
yeah,

1365
00:38:40,991 --> 00:38:41,290
I mean,

1366
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:42,550
so that anytime anybody thought,

1367
00:38:42,551 --> 00:38:42,731
if you,

1368
00:38:42,731 --> 00:38:43,121
they would think,

1369
00:38:43,121 --> 00:38:43,331
okay,

1370
00:38:43,331 --> 00:38:44,920
he's the chicken fucker and I'm going,

1371
00:38:44,921 --> 00:38:45,580
wait,

1372
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:45,970
really?

1373
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:47,410
He really said yes and I say,

1374
00:38:47,411 --> 00:38:47,951
I said to him,

1375
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:48,340
I said,

1376
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,210
I said two things,

1377
00:38:49,211 --> 00:38:49,900
dude.

1378
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:50,141
I said,

1379
00:38:50,141 --> 00:38:52,270
the first thing is I got
to live in this town,

1380
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:52,840
right,

1381
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,970
so really you want that to be
the first thing people think.

1382
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,330
Okay.

1383
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:59,830
The second thing is I got to have a career
after this stupid idea of yours fails

1384
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:01,091
and you're like,

1385
00:39:01,091 --> 00:39:01,211
no,

1386
00:39:01,211 --> 00:39:01,841
you don't understand.

1387
00:39:01,841 --> 00:39:02,030
We're,

1388
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:03,580
we're building up a mental image.

1389
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:04,690
You'll be a household name.

1390
00:39:04,691 --> 00:39:04,961
I said,

1391
00:39:04,961 --> 00:39:05,171
yes,

1392
00:39:05,171 --> 00:39:06,130
I'll be the household name.

1393
00:39:06,131 --> 00:39:07,270
The guy who fucks chickens

1394
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:09,790
and finding no,

1395
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:10,001
he was,

1396
00:39:10,001 --> 00:39:10,420
after that,

1397
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,253
I finally said,

1398
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:11,651
I said,

1399
00:39:11,651 --> 00:39:12,070
dude,

1400
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:14,230
do you want to step outside right now?

1401
00:39:14,231 --> 00:39:16,910
I don't mean my wife laughed at
me because I'm already an old man.

1402
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,261
When I'm saying,

1403
00:39:17,261 --> 00:39:17,610
she goes,

1404
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:18,371
that would have been great.

1405
00:39:18,371 --> 00:39:18,581
I said,

1406
00:39:18,581 --> 00:39:18,701
no,

1407
00:39:18,701 --> 00:39:18,980
this is,

1408
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,200
this guy was as old as I was,

1409
00:39:20,201 --> 00:39:25,000
but I mean I was so incensed and so
angry that this guy would would be so

1410
00:39:25,001 --> 00:39:26,110
cavalier.

1411
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,070
Your future human being and everything.

1412
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:30,830
What is it about that look right,

1413
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,170
that like cover,

1414
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:32,501
you know,

1415
00:39:32,501 --> 00:39:33,101
pinup girl.

1416
00:39:33,101 --> 00:39:33,880
That's what it's called.

1417
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,070
1950s pinup girl type of look.

1418
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,960
What is it about that that's appealing?

1419
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,480
Maybe it makes fat chicks look good.

1420
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:43,770
How dare you Doug?

1421
00:39:43,771 --> 00:39:44,291
Stan hope.

1422
00:39:44,291 --> 00:39:46,750
Do you not realize it was
a different day and age?

1423
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,900
Like I didn't smoke blunts till
I hung out with Charlie Murphy.

1424
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:53,140
He was one of the hardest deaths
that I ever had to deal with.

1425
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:53,860
Really?

1426
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:54,693
Yeah,

1427
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:56,920
cause I wish I contacted him more.

1428
00:39:56,921 --> 00:39:57,930
I wish we got together more.

1429
00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:00,730
We were always on the
road and and offstage.

1430
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,470
Maybe one of the funniest
guys of all time.

1431
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,900
He took me to dinner and like he,

1432
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:06,190
he was telling stories.

1433
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:06,340
He,

1434
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:06,820
he was,

1435
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:11,080
he told the story that I texted you
to ask him when you had them on.

1436
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:16,030
I'm supposed to ask you about Johnny Gill
who thought he could beat Oscar de la

1437
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:16,330
Hoya.

1438
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:16,781
Oh yeah,

1439
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:17,111
man.

1440
00:40:17,111 --> 00:40:17,520
You know.

1441
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,353
Wow.

1442
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,920
How did you know where that one man,

1443
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,100
I think it was Tom [inaudible].

1444
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,860
He said that Johnny Gill,

1445
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:24,723
Johnny Gill,

1446
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:27,550
we're looking at the
screen and his ass Hoya,

1447
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:28,653
he's like,

1448
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,460
you think Oscar de la
Hoya could fuck you up?

1449
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:30,911
I was like,

1450
00:40:30,911 --> 00:40:31,744
yeah.

1451
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:34,180
He's like,

1452
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:34,601
I know.

1453
00:40:34,601 --> 00:40:34,991
Right?

1454
00:40:34,991 --> 00:40:35,560
And I was like,

1455
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,340
yeah man,

1456
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,270
he's a professional,

1457
00:40:37,271 --> 00:40:38,710
but he would ruin your life.

1458
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:39,491
And he was like,

1459
00:40:39,491 --> 00:40:41,140
Johnny Gill thinks he can fuck him up.

1460
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:41,870
I was like,

1461
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:42,703
what?

1462
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:44,220
That's back when ask him was still,

1463
00:40:44,221 --> 00:40:44,521
you know,

1464
00:40:44,521 --> 00:40:45,091
finding too.

1465
00:40:45,091 --> 00:40:46,800
That's what made me really angry.

1466
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,380
I asked him was whipping somebodies ass.

1467
00:40:49,381 --> 00:40:49,490
You know,

1468
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:51,050
I'm sitting next to a balladeer,

1469
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,393
you know,

1470
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,221
I respect you.

1471
00:40:53,221 --> 00:40:54,360
You're singing on them.

1472
00:40:54,361 --> 00:40:56,010
Don't point to know frankly and go,

1473
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,080
I could whip him that.

1474
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:57,960
I don't want to hit that man.

1475
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:01,740
He really said that vehemently
man jumped up and I even,

1476
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:02,603
I even,

1477
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,980
I'm the fact that you brought it up,

1478
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,000
it ain't like I'm snitching.

1479
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:09,810
I told him Pharisees
asking him the same room,

1480
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,660
making sure that ask it
knows that you feel that way.

1481
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:15,240
I want to be there.

1482
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:17,610
I'm making sure he knows that you uh,

1483
00:41:17,611 --> 00:41:20,780
balladeer crooner you could whip him.

1484
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:21,211
Yeah,

1485
00:41:21,211 --> 00:41:22,044
man,

1486
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:22,500
that was a,

1487
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,380
to me that was the highest incidence
incidence of the highest level man.

1488
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,090
You make your money would Rose's flat in
there and all that saying you're going

1489
00:41:30,091 --> 00:41:31,800
to look at a Friday and talking
about how could whip him.

1490
00:41:31,801 --> 00:41:32,161
Come on,

1491
00:41:32,161 --> 00:41:32,994
man.

1492
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:34,881
He needs to know that.

1493
00:41:34,881 --> 00:41:36,410
He needs to know you feel that way.

1494
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,980
How's it fucking Mike Tyson?

1495
00:41:39,981 --> 00:41:40,814
Tiger story.

1496
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:41,803
Yeah.

1497
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:42,580
Oh,

1498
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,610
that was a good story.

1499
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:44,540
It's an incredible,

1500
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:44,961
yes.

1501
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:45,451
A man who,

1502
00:41:45,451 --> 00:41:48,560
one time I went to his
house and it was fat,

1503
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,300
six limos and nobody would get out.

1504
00:41:50,301 --> 00:41:53,210
The Limo s how come to mind
is getting out the car?

1505
00:41:53,211 --> 00:41:53,600
They said,

1506
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,433
hey,

1507
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,330
you don't see that line
standing over there.

1508
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:58,450
Mike tastes the lane,

1509
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,390
his front yard.

1510
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:00,730
He's like,

1511
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:01,140
hang over.

1512
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,070
Starts the only man.

1513
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:06,740
His house I went over there was
a line in the front yard loose.

1514
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:07,220
Wow.

1515
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:09,530
He was on the steps like
this with a heavy weight belt

1516
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:15,440
on the line with the gap.

1517
00:42:15,441 --> 00:42:16,130
The Cup play.

1518
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:16,963
Mike Katz,

1519
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:17,650
who was like,

1520
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:18,530
oh no man,

1521
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:18,921
no.

1522
00:42:18,921 --> 00:42:19,760
Instead of cat,

1523
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:20,690
it's a lion.

1524
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,320
Charlie Murphy was at
dinner with Maury Smith,

1525
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,630
who's a former UFC heavyweight
champion of the world.

1526
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:30,660
I haven't salivary and we're all out at
a restaurant and Charlie is convincing

1527
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:36,180
everybody that the rich hand that
y'all are sleeping on the ridge hand,

1528
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:43,430
he's explaining some particular like
martial arts move and they were,

1529
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,340
they were laughing.

1530
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:46,370
They would try and say Yay.

1531
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:47,411
And Charlie was like,

1532
00:42:47,411 --> 00:42:47,770
no,

1533
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:48,460
fuck you.

1534
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:48,761
He goes,

1535
00:42:48,761 --> 00:42:49,241
you tell me.

1536
00:42:49,241 --> 00:42:49,890
I don't,

1537
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:51,700
I don't hit you in the
head with a rich hand,

1538
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:55,010
but Charlie fucking gun
who use the and was the me.

1539
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,420
I see in the one of the
very first UFC joints,

1540
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,270
my med check with down,

1541
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:03,880
knocked out a Yarbrough
originating chocolate gum.

1542
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:04,830
Never fought Yarbrough.

1543
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:06,130
He fought some big jams.

1544
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:07,290
Keith Hackney fought.

1545
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:08,303
Yeah.

1546
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:08,591
Yeah,

1547
00:43:08,591 --> 00:43:09,424
he did though.

1548
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:11,560
That's Charlie talking about

1549
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:14,980
look how wide his eyes are.

1550
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:19,150
Look at the smile underneath his left arm.

1551
00:43:19,151 --> 00:43:20,040
Look at that guy laugh.

1552
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:21,800
We're all going to go.

1553
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:25,040
This is the point like
Ralphy like Charlie,

1554
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:25,880
like everybody.

1555
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:30,080
We're all going to go that if you could
go faster than the speed of light,

1556
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:31,550
right to the time.

1557
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,800
And then with a powerful enough,

1558
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:34,903
uh,

1559
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:38,240
telescope pointed at us to
catch the light reflected.

1560
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:39,231
Okay.

1561
00:43:39,231 --> 00:43:40,250
You could use,

1562
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:43,370
just as satellite technology
looks down on the earth,

1563
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:48,710
you could see the reflection of the
earth from that time and visually prove

1564
00:43:48,711 --> 00:43:49,700
everything you want it to.

1565
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:50,661
Whoa.

1566
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:53,000
What the light is coming
from the earth as you go.

1567
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:57,110
You would theoretically be
looking at earth at that point,

1568
00:43:57,111 --> 00:43:57,500
right?

1569
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:58,850
The reflection of the light.

1570
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:01,160
It's a as it's a million miles away.

1571
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:02,533
Yeah.

1572
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:03,021
It,

1573
00:44:03,021 --> 00:44:03,141
no,

1574
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:03,261
no,

1575
00:44:03,261 --> 00:44:03,830
no.

1576
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:05,570
If you light the light,

1577
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:06,973
the light,

1578
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,330
good time to be alive.

1579
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,340
But as the human race,

1580
00:44:10,341 --> 00:44:11,270
as a person,

1581
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:12,163
all of us,

1582
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,240
there's no one gets out alive.

1583
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:14,481
No.

1584
00:44:14,481 --> 00:44:15,730
One quicker.

1585
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:16,880
We remember that.

1586
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:17,931
The better.

1587
00:44:17,931 --> 00:44:18,764
We're all be

1588
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:21,133
not work.

1589
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:22,890
I was cut off a couple times.

1590
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:28,900
Okay.
