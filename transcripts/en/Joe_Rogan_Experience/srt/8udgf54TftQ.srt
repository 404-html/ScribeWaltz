1
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:53,030
Right now,
here we go.

2
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,370
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're live.

3
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,470
We've done it faster this time than 
ever.

4
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,410
We're getting better at it.
Less fuckups,

5
00:01:10,411 --> 00:01:13,170
less hiccups.
Live from the compound.

6
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,140
Uh,
we started a little bit late today.

7
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,220
That was all my fault.
Brian was rocked and locked and loaded.

8
00:01:20,221 --> 00:01:25,221
This time I just fucked up.
I was tired because I had to do the 

9
00:01:25,221 --> 00:01:28,500
feminine being show this morning and I 
had to get up early because I have to 

10
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,361
leave my house is kind of far from them.
What the fuck people that's gone down,

11
00:01:32,401 --> 00:01:35,380
but just happy new year.
Uh,

12
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,760
Brian is all in a tizzy about the God 
Damn Ipad and me.

13
00:01:41,831 --> 00:01:46,831
I twittered that I don't need an ipad 
because I'm a fucking man and I can 

14
00:01:46,831 --> 00:01:51,081
carry a goddamn backpack with a laptop 
and I don't complain like a little 

15
00:01:51,081 --> 00:01:54,891
bitch.
And this seems like it's got less shit 

16
00:01:54,891 --> 00:01:54,891
than a laptop.

17
00:01:54,891 --> 00:01:56,050
And if you're going to go like on an 
airplane or something,

18
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,210
go somewhere.
You want to fucking laptop.

19
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,060
We want to be able to get on the 
computer.

20
00:02:00,061 --> 00:02:05,061
You want to be able to send someone to 
real goddamn email or attach something 

21
00:02:05,061 --> 00:02:07,560
to it and send a real link.
Easy copy and paste old school.

22
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,560
You don't want some nutty fucking finger
things.

23
00:02:10,561 --> 00:02:15,561
You have to shut up.
I want to fucking laptop and it's not 

24
00:02:15,561 --> 00:02:16,230
heavy.
I can take this goddamn thing anywhere.

25
00:02:16,231 --> 00:02:19,440
They're so small now.
I mean the sin and the light.

26
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,170
This is.
I got to hit.

27
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,620
This is the 17 inch Mac book.
This thing is,

28
00:02:24,621 --> 00:02:26,670
it's not heavy.
He put it in a backpack.

29
00:02:26,671 --> 00:02:28,820
You're fine.
I don't need an IPAD,

30
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,480
Brian.
Well see,

31
00:02:30,481 --> 00:02:35,481
I think that's the problem with a.
can everyone hear us okay before we 

32
00:02:35,481 --> 00:02:38,490
start getting really into it as the 
microphone back where we are.

33
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,920
Not a well polished machine.
Some gentleman.

34
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:46,050
Now where's the time here?
I'll see if,

35
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,870
if we can hear ourselves.
This is.

36
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,850
If this was like real tv,
we'd be fun.

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,520
We'll see if we can hear ourselves.
Who we are.

38
00:02:58,730 --> 00:02:59,720
We're,
yeah,

39
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,060
we're

40
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,580
good.
Alright,

41
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,320
so here's the thing.
What about that,

42
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:08,330
the whole that tablet.
Now the problem with the whole thing is 

43
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,491
that Steve Jobs pretty much just bashed 
net books at the beginning of the the 

44
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:16,050
thing,
so it really set a nerve with a lot of 

45
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:16,050
people,
meaning people are like,

46
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,530
what nipples vendor,
so he knows in his speech and his speech

47
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,210
that much

48
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,020
fan boy,
I'm not going to sit and watch you strut

49
00:03:22,021 --> 00:03:24,480
around and talk about your fucking 
computer.

50
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:29,690
I enjoy your stuff.
I think your iphone is a goddamn work 

51
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:32,130
with are amazing.
If verizon had it,

52
00:03:32,131 --> 00:03:33,840
it would be the greatest school in the 
history of the universe,

53
00:03:33,841 --> 00:03:36,300
but I can't use it as a phone.
I use it to me.

54
00:03:36,301 --> 00:03:37,710
I have.
I carry two phones.

55
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:42,950
I carry a blackberry and verizon.
That's a fucking phone I can call 

56
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:42,950
people.
It sucks.

57
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,060
It's terrible phone.
It's like a drunk iphone.

58
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,980
Like when you compare the two of them 
together,

59
00:03:46,981 --> 00:03:49,260
there's no comparison.
Like sometimes,

60
00:03:49,261 --> 00:03:54,261
like I say,
if I call you and I have a little 

61
00:03:54,261 --> 00:03:54,390
picture for your face when I call you 
and I go to call somebody else,

62
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:59,110
when I start calling somebody else,
your picture will show up and then it'll

63
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:01,680
change.
So it's like the things like,

64
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,660
oh,
I'm going to go on.

65
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,250
It's like it's dumb,
it's a dumb phone.

66
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,420
It's like it does what you want to,
but it takes like a couple extra seconds

67
00:04:09,421 --> 00:04:12,090
and it stumbles this storm to.
Yeah,

68
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:16,280
the strong to the screen is awesome.
It's a nice big ass screen and I,

69
00:04:16,281 --> 00:04:18,720
I liked that.
And the touchscreen's not too bad.

70
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,170
It's pretty easy to type the,
even this way in landscape mode,

71
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,420
it's good.
It's like,

72
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,280
it's weird.
It gives you a little feedback,

73
00:04:26,281 --> 00:04:28,440
which really isn't necessary but it's 
not bad.

74
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:34,080
And as a phone it's great,
but compared to the iphone was just 

75
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,080
getting on the web.
It's just like,

76
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,270
like you're doing it in an old wooden 
car,

77
00:04:36,271 --> 00:04:39,720
you know,
it's just so clunky and stupid and zoom,

78
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,240
okay,
scroll this way and Oh,

79
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:43,520
come on.
Really what

80
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,360
you're saying is the best part about the
iphone is probably Internet and the 

81
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,571
worst part is the worst part is clearly 
I don't mind making calls on calls on 

82
00:04:53,421 --> 00:04:54,510
his bad ass,
just that,

83
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,590
but I just don't want.
Tea is just terrible.

84
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,860
It might be better in somebody's town,
you know,

85
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,450
for.
They've got more towers,

86
00:05:02,451 --> 00:05:04,570
more GSM towers.
So they took the,

87
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,600
the,
the best part of the iphone and made it 

88
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:09,600
a little bit bigger.
Yeah.

89
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,370
And they got rid of like no camera.
What the fuck?

90
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:15,650
Well here's the whole thing about this.
What I'm thinking now is I'm thinking,

91
00:05:15,651 --> 00:05:16,610
all right,
I like my iphone,

92
00:05:16,611 --> 00:05:21,611
but I only use it once in awhile.
I want something small to surf the net 

93
00:05:21,611 --> 00:05:21,611
and do basic shit with.
Oh,

94
00:05:21,611 --> 00:05:26,501
I listen to this.
Say you're in a starbucks and some dude 

95
00:05:26,501 --> 00:05:26,501
comes in and starts spraying the place.

96
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,820
Okay.
And you want to be taking video,

97
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:33,910
right?
And you're on your little ipad thinking 

98
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,720
you're a genius sipping on your lives.
Have two cameras have shit.

99
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,630
You not me.
You're just a regular dude.

100
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,680
Just as your digital camera.
You have us as an ipad and the 

101
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,260
blackberry because he's not sold on 
apple online.

102
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:50,350
He's online right there and he wants to 
get online with his ipad and take video 

103
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,120
and streaming to stream of this 
happening and he can't do it because the

104
00:05:53,121 --> 00:05:54,430
ipads a piece of shit.
Okay,

105
00:05:54,431 --> 00:05:55,520
well listen to have a camera.
Well,

106
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:56,240
listen,
now,

107
00:05:56,241 --> 00:05:58,470
one of the things that he in his space 
logic,

108
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,600
here's my argument,
he said during the speech that it has a 

109
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,991
port that is going to have accessories 
to open it up to the universe.

110
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:14,460
Imagine having an hd camera hooked up to
the bottom and you just happened to be 

111
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,770
streaming through starbucks,
like a fucking creep.

112
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,460
You can't even do it on the dl.
Everybody's gonna know you're gonna.

113
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,570
Be Out there scanning people with your 
little Webcam.

114
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,790
No.
What if it snapped on the front?

115
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:25,200
So you're on the Webcam and starbucks 
and what?

116
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:30,220
Starbucks.
It has to have a laptop at starbucks has

117
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:35,460
a thing that you had already has 
attachments for like a card reader as 

118
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:35,470
next week.
Be At starbucks.

119
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,210
We're going to be at the coffee.
No,

120
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,340
but that's what I'm saying.
It doesn't have a camera,

121
00:06:40,341 --> 00:06:41,780
but yet it has an attachment that he 
said,

122
00:06:41,781 --> 00:06:46,781
well,
have accessories like microphones and 

123
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:46,870
cameras and on the fucking thing,
bitch,

124
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,550
you want to be super special and wanted 
to be the bomb.

125
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,320
I think they're trying to keep it down.
Price,

126
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,480
supply zone under $500 because here's 
the thing.

127
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:55,250
If you're going to buy a book reader 
right now,

128
00:06:55,251 --> 00:06:57,860
you're on Amazon.com.
You're looking at the kindle,

129
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:01,190
the kindle,
that's $10 cheaper than this thing.

130
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,420
That makes a lot of sense actually,
and it's backlit.

131
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,400
I have a sony reader,
but it's.

132
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,580
I read in bed,
so when my girlfriend's sleeping I want 

133
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:12,580
to read.
I can't.

134
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,210
I have to have a light on and it can't 
even just be a dim light.

135
00:07:14,211 --> 00:07:15,950
It has to be a bright light for me to 
read it.

136
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:21,200
So now I got a little lip on soccer.
Get to sleep right next to you,

137
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,540
especially if you've got a kindle.
I love the cover.

138
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,980
He put the light here.
Bam.

139
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:30,090
You can read right next to him.
So this thing will be great for the 

140
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:34,310
married dudes talking right next to me 
when I was single.

141
00:07:34,311 --> 00:07:35,030
I'd be like,
well,

142
00:07:35,031 --> 00:07:37,470
I guess you can't sleep,
you know,

143
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,260
I can't sleep while you're reading a 
book.

144
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,510
Well maybe the couch would be a better 
place for you to sleep.

145
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,680
Totally.
What the fuck are you talking about?

146
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,380
Totally.
So that's like $10 more.

147
00:07:46,381 --> 00:07:48,150
What did you get that?
And if you didn't have one already,

148
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,250
if you are getting a book reader,
would you get $10 more?

149
00:07:50,251 --> 00:07:51,560
Would you pay for the tablets?

150
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,090
That's the best argument I've ever 
heard.

151
00:07:53,091 --> 00:07:56,200
If I had to choose between the kindle 
and the IPAD,

152
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,420
would for sure take the time.

153
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:01,240
And now the argument on the other side 
yard man on the other side,

154
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,320
e ink,
uh,

155
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,020
is less stressful on the eyes.
But here's what I'm thinking.

156
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:10,050
Is that true?
It might be something to sell that 

157
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:10,050
technology,
but.

158
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,160
And here's what I'm thinking.
I'm on the computer 11 hours a day,

159
00:08:12,161 --> 00:08:17,161
10 hours a day.
I'm doing 99 percent reading and I've 

160
00:08:17,161 --> 00:08:19,480
never gone,
oh my foods once in a while.

161
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:20,900
Notice that I think,
well,

162
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,380
it could be also because I'm getting 
older,

163
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:27,590
but my eyesight is not as good.
Meaning like say if I have to read a 

164
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,490
vitamin bottle or it tells me how many 
supposed to take.

165
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,630
I struggled with that Shit,
right?

166
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,900
No,
I have to try to focus.

167
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,460
It's not what it used to be,

168
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,960
so I don't read more than like an hour,
two hours.

169
00:08:37,961 --> 00:08:42,961
I'm going to eat book anyways a day and 
so I'm thinking if I'm on the computer 

170
00:08:42,961 --> 00:08:44,470
12 hours already a day,
now you use two hours of that.

171
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,980
I don't think it's caught.
Flaco says everything.

172
00:08:47,981 --> 00:08:52,981
Apple makes us perfect.
Steve Jobs is God and Bill Gates is a 

173
00:08:52,981 --> 00:08:55,140
Nazi.
Was obviously no,

174
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:00,330
those are strong words.
Do you think that's the real flop on the

175
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:05,331
real flap or is a craziest?
If you don't only as well the craziest 

176
00:09:05,331 --> 00:09:09,291
characters on the Internet and he's just
nutty dude from England and let's get 

177
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,700
fucked up all day and he's got a lot of 
money so he doesn't have to work.

178
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,920
So the dude just gets online,
just trolls.

179
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:17,400
People in flux with them all day.
He's really hilarious.

180
00:09:17,401 --> 00:09:19,420
He's crazy.
You can find at your website,

181
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,440
[inaudible] dot net on the forums and 
slept for flap out and he just picks 

182
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,890
fights with people.
He finds somebody just insults them over

183
00:09:25,891 --> 00:09:28,070
and over again and everybody's 
discussing assholes.

184
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,450
Guy's an asshole and yeah.
Yeah.

185
00:09:30,451 --> 00:09:35,451
But there's something about it that's so
endearing is he's really doing it for 

186
00:09:35,451 --> 00:09:37,080
entertainment.
He's a character.

187
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:41,070
He's like an internet character that's 
like running through this,

188
00:09:41,071 --> 00:09:43,080
uh,
this show we're doing in the show is the

189
00:09:43,081 --> 00:09:44,520
website,
the forums,

190
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:45,870
and he's like,
this character.

191
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:50,870
He's like,
one of the ideas is this insane won't 

192
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:50,870
meet us,
either won't meet us.

193
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,650
He's kind of a shut in,
but I understand that,

194
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:58,130
you know,
I mean if you're some crazy dudes just 

195
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,010
stays on the Internet all day.
I wouldn't even care what he looks like.

196
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,500
He could be totally trouble over this 
whole story.

197
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:03,870
I don't care.
I just think he's an interesting dude.

198
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:08,940
Be Nice to say hi,
but he doesn't want us to take pictures 

199
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,300
of it and put it online because then 
everybody will have evidence.

200
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,150
They'll have weapons and ammunition to 
go against him.

201
00:10:12,151 --> 00:10:15,000
And his Internet wars and they're 
supposedly one picture of him.

202
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,240
Yeah.
But who the fuck knows if not smiling 

203
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,870
and he's never met anybody.
How do we know it can be a boyfriend.

204
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,350
Could be one of your ex.
It's vicious.

205
00:10:28,351 --> 00:10:29,640
And who the hell knows?

206
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,410
We have no idea.
It's a guy.

207
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:36,650
No idea about the internet.
The fastest meeting people that are 

208
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:36,790
cool.
I have so many friends.

209
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,280
You are one of them.
I met on the Internet,

210
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,700
but there's so many people that we've 
met from your message board and in other

211
00:10:41,701 --> 00:10:43,860
places.
That seems like a crazy thing to say.

212
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,990
It seems like you're an idiot.
What are you doing?

213
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:50,250
Fucking people from your message board,
but you know when you're either.

214
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,980
Bottom line is for real.
It's like you're meeting people all over

215
00:10:52,981 --> 00:10:54,620
the country.
Anyone when you're doing standup,

216
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:59,650
what are the differences that make give 
you meet them online first and wouldn't 

217
00:10:59,650 --> 00:10:59,650
that be smarter?
You know,

218
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:05,960
the only way to interact with people is.
I mean the Internet is the greatest for 

219
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:10,881
that.
Like there's people that could never 

220
00:11:10,881 --> 00:11:12,921
have relationships that didn't have any 
friends that are nothing going on in 

221
00:11:12,921 --> 00:11:17,211
their real life,
but they developed the whole Internet 

222
00:11:17,211 --> 00:11:17,211
worlds,
man,

223
00:11:17,211 --> 00:11:18,350
quick player buddies of mine when I was 
like,

224
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,100
seriously addicted to playing quake.

225
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:25,390
There's like lived their whole life on 
the Internet and that's where all their 

226
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:29,871
friendships came from.
And you get to know people like they're 

227
00:11:29,871 --> 00:11:29,871
in,
you know,

228
00:11:29,871 --> 00:11:29,871
it's,
it's,

229
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:35,450
it's a little more,
it sounds crazy saying that you meet 

230
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:39,800
people from the Internet,
but it's really probably pretty 

231
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:39,800
intelligent.
Uh,

232
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,210
girls that like use dating sites.
They used to be thought of as losers,

233
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:43,560
you know,
you'd hear about like,

234
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:44,400
oh,
her sister,

235
00:11:44,401 --> 00:11:47,010
she's on a fucking match.com
or wherever the fuck it is.

236
00:11:47,011 --> 00:11:47,470
Like,
Oh,

237
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,780
poor girl,
what the fuck?

238
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,910
Then you think about being a chick.
Oh,

239
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,280
the fucking scumbags out there when you 
want to like,

240
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:56,720
listen to them talk for awhile first,
see what they have,

241
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,840
what nutty shit they want to say in 
their email.

242
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:02,070
See how they say you're in your.
Do you use that apostrophe?

243
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:06,250
You fucking Cretin you cave person.
You know,

244
00:12:06,251 --> 00:12:07,060
you know what I mean?

245
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,840
It's funny.
That's that dating sites,

246
00:12:09,841 --> 00:12:12,190
how many different ones?
They are like j date.

247
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:17,191
That's for Jewish people.
They have one for the people that just 

248
00:12:17,191 --> 00:12:17,191
have herpes.
I forget the name of it.

249
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,860
They have one for like anything you 
could possibly want.

250
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,500
All girls is suck.
Magic Johnson

251
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:27,590
the folder.
That was funny.

252
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:34,110
I listen to this guy and this guy says,
Joe ever heard about reverse speech?

253
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,690
Everything you say says something in 
reverse.

254
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:41,930
Now.
Ordinarily I would say that's retarded 

255
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:43,110
bullshit,
but I smoked some marijuana right before

256
00:12:43,111 --> 00:12:45,120
we did this broadcast and I'm like,
man,

257
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,620
who the hell knows?
Maybe.

258
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:51,750
Maybe we just don't know that in 
language you can reverse it and it can 

259
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,300
show true intention.
Is that possible by the way,

260
00:12:54,301 --> 00:12:56,520
your intonations and.
No,

261
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,250
I mean I don't think it is,
but maybe it is.

262
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,380
What the fuck do I know?
Well,

263
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:03,180
you know,
things that are possible are so nutty.

264
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,050
You know?
Why?

265
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,000
Why do you think that?
I mean,

266
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:10,130
that could be just some weird side 
effect or speech that when you reverse 

267
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:13,821
things,
it says the opposite of what the person 

268
00:13:13,821 --> 00:13:13,821
or the person really means is possible.

269
00:13:13,821 --> 00:13:14,790
Shit.
What the fuck knows?

270
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:20,030
The world is so nutty as it is.
The fact that we're on this sphere that 

271
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:23,220
hovers around this gigantic nuclear 
explosion.

272
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:28,230
It flies to the galaxy,
but everybody wants to talk about the 

273
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:28,500
cast of Jersey shore renegotiating their
deal.

274
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,040
I mean that's like the number one 
conversation and or how many,

275
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:37,041
you know,
how many more millions they're going to 

276
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,051
give Conan O'brien at Fox or you know,
how many more checks that tiger woods 

277
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:40,890
fuck [inaudible] his wife's going to get
back together with them.

278
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:46,190
It's like we get so caught up in 
nonsense and I've been trying to figure 

279
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,940
that out more and more as I get older,
like what it is,

280
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,160
because it's not just you.
I say,

281
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,690
you know people.
I say,

282
00:13:51,691 --> 00:13:53,850
we,
I get caught up in that stupid shit too.

283
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:59,030
I was wondering what was going to happen
to John when he left kate because he 

284
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,840
wasn't making any money anymore and all 
of a sudden he has to pay Matt Alimony,

285
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:06,080
you know,
because I think they're probably 

286
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,080
negotiate that shit when he was on the 
show and he's making good money,

287
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,270
but they kicked them off that show and 
then they're going to sue him and he was

288
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,650
the poor dude,
you know?

289
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,140
I mean he just fell apart in front of 
the whole world.

290
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:18,670
First he fell apart in front of the 
whole world because he was married to 

291
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:18,690
that chick who was just treating him 
like shit.

292
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,460
Like it would.
You would watch that show and like,

293
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:21,900
wow,
that bitch is harsh,

294
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,030
but then you realize,
God damn.

295
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:26,610
Could you imagine having eight kids with
that week?

296
00:14:26,611 --> 00:14:31,611
Dude,
that guy such a bitch that you would be 

297
00:14:31,611 --> 00:14:31,611
like,
oh,

298
00:14:31,611 --> 00:14:33,360
I can't count on this motherfucker.
Come on,

299
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,640
get up.
You have to work.

300
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,800
Come on.
We were just lazy and soft and dol 

301
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,210
minded,
but he got on TV and when he got on tv,

302
00:14:42,211 --> 00:14:44,820
I think girls just start saying,
you shouldn't take that from him.

303
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:47,520
She's a bitch.
She doesn't appreciate you.

304
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,920
I see on that show.
Thank you so high.

305
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:52,220
I think you're so cool.
Next thing you know he's in there.

306
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:53,930
Oh Shit.
I'm hot and cool.

307
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:59,170
Oh Shit.
He didn't realize that he himself had 

308
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:02,861
been tricked by fame.
It's just like those poor girls that 

309
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:03,260
fuck them.
That's how powerful famous fame tricks.

310
00:15:03,261 --> 00:15:05,180
Even the person that has the fame.

311
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:07,290
The worst is that Tila?
Tequila girl.

312
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,890
Oh,
she's the worst.

313
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:12,180
Every time I hear about I just get sick 
to my stomach.

314
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:15,420
I'm just waiting for a baby right now.
Listen,

315
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,360
that's all.
Just to get you to pay attention.

316
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,370
She's crafty.
Little little winch.

317
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:26,210
Yeah.
She's going to do a porn I would 

318
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:26,210
imagine.
I think she already has.

319
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:27,350
I remember having.
It's amazing when they like.

320
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,040
Just totally.
I'm like,

321
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,040
orchestrate sex tapes,
you know?

322
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,470
Is there any doubt that the Kim 
Kardashians sex tape.

323
00:15:34,471 --> 00:15:36,000
Have you ever watched a I?
Yeah.

324
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,290
You.
There's different cameras.

325
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,420
Yeah,
I mean time.

326
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:44,450
Is it really different?
There's different angles that I knew it 

327
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,080
was tentative.
I thought that the company does

328
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,440
and she keeps her bra,
which is very disturbing.

329
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:54,540
Some Tutsis free.
Then mtds free like,

330
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,520
oh,
come on.

331
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,940
Just let 'em free.
She probably doesn't like her nipples.

332
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,160
She looks like she's probably got some 
big ones.

333
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:03,240
What do you think?
You got to guess?

334
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,400
Oh,
definitely be picture one punch.

335
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:07,350
Can pictures of her nipples.
Other something.

336
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:12,630
Watch your whole video.
I watched a few seconds skip right time 

337
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:15,360
to beat off and have a very hard time 
beating off to black guys.

338
00:16:15,361 --> 00:16:18,300
Fucking white girls because I don't feel
like that's me.

339
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:23,570
I don't know how much fantasy can I have
to what?

340
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:30,020
To me,
it just bleed off in front of my new 

341
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,130
kitten for the first time today,
today and how much in front of them?

342
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:35,640
How far was I was beating off and the 
cat jumped right up on my laptop and I'm

343
00:16:35,641 --> 00:16:36,420
like,
oh,

344
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,100
well I guess you're going to see it 
eventually.

345
00:16:38,101 --> 00:16:41,990
So there it is.
Like it feel like you.

346
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:46,260
It's like I really hope like my 
grandparents are like,

347
00:16:46,261 --> 00:16:48,230
you find out later that you're like,
you're your,

348
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:50,850
your,
your ancestors come back as like animals

349
00:16:50,851 --> 00:16:55,851
or something that they can watch you 
like to talk to build that bridge.

350
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:57,930
Yeah.
Talk.

351
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:03,030
Remember Joe,
his joke about chuck it off for the cat 

352
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,920
is about to come and the kids doing this

353
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,530
move.
Move.

354
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:12,900
Oh,
it's weird how like a cats used to be 

355
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:13,360
worshiped back in the day.
Yeah.

356
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:13,980
What do you think?
That's.

357
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:19,120
I mean what if there is something to a 
cat that we just don't know and it was 

358
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:19,120
lost in transition,
you know,

359
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:19,590
like no one ever wrote it down.
Like,

360
00:17:19,591 --> 00:17:24,591
oh by the way,
if you look at the cat's eyes every day 

361
00:17:24,591 --> 00:17:24,810
at midnight,
you can talk to we know what just

362
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:29,960
about like Egypt worshiping cats.
It's like they were so good at making 

363
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,810
things like how I wonder what they were 
really like because we don't really have

364
00:17:32,811 --> 00:17:37,811
any idea about their cultural.
Translating their language over the 

365
00:17:37,811 --> 00:17:39,650
English.
It's also tricky and the hieroglyphs and

366
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:43,400
they don't really know how far back 
there their history goes because there's

367
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:48,740
like John Anthony West,
that guy thinks that their history goes 

368
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:51,311
back like 30,000
years and he even has hieroglyphs that 

369
00:17:51,311 --> 00:17:54,711
prove it,
but they were so smart when it came to 

370
00:17:54,711 --> 00:17:54,780
constructing things.
I wonder what they would like,

371
00:17:54,781 --> 00:17:55,710
you know,
socially,

372
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,390
you know.
Yeah.

373
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:58,210
Like,
like,

374
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:01,750
just sitting around talking to them,
you know,

375
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,750
it's really kind of crazy when you think
about what those,

376
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:08,810
those people pulled off.
And that was like supposedly a 22,000,

377
00:18:09,001 --> 00:18:13,260
500 years before Christ before zero.
That's incredible.

378
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,410
And they were working with seven cats,
like maybe they,

379
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,220
maybe they know.

380
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:22,470
Yeah,
there's something with fucking smart 

381
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,471
where they,
I mean I would like to know how smart 

382
00:18:24,471 --> 00:18:24,471
they were.
Maybe they were just completely retarded

383
00:18:24,471 --> 00:18:28,580
and just didn't really know how to build
things and they will just write and 

384
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:28,580
that's why they're there.
Culture to suck.

385
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,070
But I don't think so because people 
like,

386
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,140
like,
um,

387
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,470
I think socrates and no Hurghada this 
Hurghada just went over from um,

388
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,190
no,
there's the,

389
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:45,370
there's the uh,
there's the charge for this cat is very 

390
00:18:46,101 --> 00:18:48,800
emotional.
Sometimes can manage.

391
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:52,340
She would get mad because we've got 
another cat to.

392
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,310
She started peeing on Shit.
Speaking of the other cat just walks in.

393
00:18:55,311 --> 00:18:56,500
Right.
And you said that Oliver,

394
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,190
come here buddy.
All of this cool.

395
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,410
I liked him.
He's a cool little dude.

396
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,350
I like cats.
You know,

397
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:05,430
when I like cats because I'm not 
starving to death.

398
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:08,670
That's why I don't understand like when 
you people are living in Egypt,

399
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,660
I mean how fucking smart were they?

400
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:15,890
They must've had a pretty sophisticated 
culture because they were really into 

401
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:18,680
keep animals as pets and feeding.
The dogs are going to protect your 

402
00:19:19,141 --> 00:19:24,141
house.
They're gonna do the campaigns doing 

403
00:19:24,141 --> 00:19:24,141
shit.
You rubbed them.

404
00:19:24,141 --> 00:19:24,570
That's all you get.
You get ipr and I like,

405
00:19:24,571 --> 00:19:25,980
you're robbing me.
That's all it is.

406
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,660
So they were smart enough to build 
pyramids,

407
00:19:27,661 --> 00:19:30,010
but yet they worshiped cats because 
there's.

408
00:19:30,011 --> 00:19:32,190
There's something to the captain we 
don't know about spazz.

409
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:37,250
Is there something to cats?
You ever see a cat when the light hits 

410
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,970
their eyes in a certain way and it looks
like a Hologram or something going on in

411
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:40,200
their eyes.
That shit's weird.

412
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:42,360
Well,
their eyesight is insane there.

413
00:19:42,361 --> 00:19:45,030
I started some insane amount better than
ours.

414
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,110
Is it?
Oh yeah.

415
00:19:46,111 --> 00:19:51,111
Their eyesight is incredible and it's 
dark and darkens vision is incredible 

416
00:19:51,111 --> 00:19:52,590
and their hearing is incredible.
That cat hears everything.

417
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,530
She'll hear shit like that.
Her.

418
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:59,940
She'll be sleeping and then you'll see 
her all curled up and then I'll move 

419
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:00,390
something in the room.
You see her little ears just go.

420
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,190
You know,
it's like they're,

421
00:20:03,191 --> 00:20:07,410
they're tuning in to like specific 
locations where mice are trying to sneak

422
00:20:07,411 --> 00:20:08,490
by,
you know,

423
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,350
that they got this killer.
Fuck it.

424
00:20:10,351 --> 00:20:15,351
It's really weird to see because the 
bottom line is she only respects me and 

425
00:20:15,351 --> 00:20:16,920
loves me and everything first of all 
because I feed her and pet her,

426
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:22,040
but also because I'm so much bigger than
in her because if that was smaller than 

427
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:22,040
her,
she would fuck me up.

428
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,060
Cats don't give a fuck about little 
things.

429
00:20:24,061 --> 00:20:26,730
You can't keep a pet journal around your
cat.

430
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:31,760
They don't have that agreement.
You can train a dog to not kill a 

431
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,100
durable.
You cannot train a cat.

432
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,360
No,
you can't do it.

433
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,380
You leave that job around that cat is 
gonna.

434
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,440
Fuck that thing up.
It's crazy.

435
00:20:37,441 --> 00:20:39,540
They cannot avoid it.
They love it.

436
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,020
They love killing things,
man.

437
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,060
Yeah,
I was.

438
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:43,350
When I was growing up,
when I was a kid,

439
00:20:43,351 --> 00:20:48,351
we had a big ass black tomcat and he 
used to kill and he used to kill 

440
00:20:48,401 --> 00:20:53,401
squirrels.
We lived right across the street from 

441
00:20:53,401 --> 00:20:53,401
this river and there was like,
oh,

442
00:20:53,401 --> 00:20:53,890
a whole.
A lot of wooded areas.

443
00:20:53,891 --> 00:20:55,510
Like many,
many acres.

444
00:20:55,540 --> 00:21:00,540
As soon as a lot of animals around there
and these fucking girls would be all 

445
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,200
over this tree and this cat,
which is creep through the grass,

446
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:07,530
he's a fucking monster.
One pause and hover and I would watch 

447
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:10,240
him from the window across the street 
from our house dude who said it was like

448
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:14,440
National Geographic.
He fucking chases him and that squirrels

449
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:19,441
trying to leave and he pounds on their 
back and get the back and sink their 

450
00:21:19,441 --> 00:21:21,670
teeth into the neck and dragged this 
thing in between his legs.

451
00:21:21,671 --> 00:21:23,950
That was what was really crazy.
He had this girl's body,

452
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:27,730
which was almost as big as him.
It was pretty fucking big,

453
00:21:27,731 --> 00:21:32,731
like half the size of his body and he's 
dragging it in between his legs and 

454
00:21:32,731 --> 00:21:34,030
taking this girl across the street to 
our house.

455
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:34,970
I was like

456
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:37,780
nutty as APP.
What if I went out and killed a dog?

457
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,510
What if I went out and killed a dog with
a knife in front of you?

458
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:42,850
Wouldn't you like look at me different?
Would it be like,

459
00:21:42,851 --> 00:21:43,960
Bro,
what the fuck did you.

460
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,030
But you know,
he came in.

461
00:21:46,031 --> 00:21:46,570
I'm like,
what's up?

462
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:48,610
I'm like rubbing his head.
What's up?

463
00:21:48,611 --> 00:21:53,611
Little Buddy.
When you gotta sell you gotta you gotTa 

464
00:21:53,611 --> 00:21:53,611
score.
But I didn't.

465
00:21:53,611 --> 00:21:57,780
I didn't feel bad.
He murdered this poor little animal 

466
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:01,220
because his girl,
probably a little squirrel family was 

467
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:01,220
scrub mother.
He's not even hungry.

468
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,550
I feed his fat ass everyday.
He would come and I'd give him a fucking

469
00:22:03,551 --> 00:22:04,520
Kenneth Dog,
cat,

470
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,830
little cat food.
He would be fine.

471
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,960
Maybe that square was trying to help you
to like ricky ticky.

472
00:22:07,961 --> 00:22:11,140
Timbo remember that old,
that old story where he's trying to save

473
00:22:11,141 --> 00:22:12,430
the family from the snake.

474
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,120
Maybe the square was trying to think.
Squirrels.

475
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:18,250
Little animals I liked,
but I'm a.

476
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,740
I discriminate when it comes to rodents,
like squirrels,

477
00:22:20,741 --> 00:22:23,020
they make the grade.
I never feel bad when I see them,

478
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:25,800
but if I see a rat that's close,
you know,

479
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:28,180
Iran is that close.
Like say if you're sitting with your kid

480
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:33,181
at the park and there's a tree and the 
tree is literally right there and the 

481
00:22:33,181 --> 00:22:33,181
trees go scrub.
Like,

482
00:22:33,181 --> 00:22:34,600
oh look at this girl and this girl.
He's right there.

483
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:36,220
But if that was a rat,
like,

484
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:37,240
oh,
get the fuck back.

485
00:22:37,241 --> 00:22:38,370
The rats,
they're so rad.

486
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:42,970
Fucking stick gonna wrap it up.
You just start freaking out and yelling.

487
00:22:42,971 --> 00:22:45,790
Shit the fuck out of here.
Fucking rat.

488
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,350
But I'm scared of rats,
dude.

489
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:50,620
That's what that big.
And I'm scared of him in Jersey.

490
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:53,800
Devil come at,
you know you've got to be careful.

491
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:58,860
Like don't bite your ass man.
I got a came after by a skunk last week 

492
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,540
and they charged me and the dog and 
Chris,

493
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:02,560
my dogs.
It's like kill,

494
00:23:02,561 --> 00:23:03,160
kill,
kill.

495
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,620
Well listen to me but doesn't know it's 
going to spray him.

496
00:23:05,621 --> 00:23:10,621
And then that's going to be like five 
hours of my time of trying to use 

497
00:23:10,621 --> 00:23:13,420
vinegar and imagine to a dog.
Dogs have these insane.

498
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,190
They like it or not.

499
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:20,510
Oh my God.
Of course you don't like it would be 

500
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:21,000
funny if they did,
would.

501
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,340
That would be like an animal that's 
trying to commit suicide.

502
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:28,620
You know,
if that was the evolutionary thing with 

503
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,130
met the dogs loved it and you spray your
shit.

504
00:23:29,131 --> 00:23:34,131
The dog liked it.
Did want you to spray so they'd want to 

505
00:23:34,131 --> 00:23:34,131
kill you all the time.

506
00:23:34,131 --> 00:23:36,020
Psychiatric catnip.
Why does catnip not working on any other

507
00:23:36,021 --> 00:23:36,380
animal?
No,

508
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:38,370
these guys are weird.
Look at this guy.

509
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,020
Joe,
what's your favorite way to smoke?

510
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:43,290
Like some people get nutty about it.
Just smoke your weed.

511
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:47,120
People did because there's a certain 
group of people that follow you that are

512
00:23:47,121 --> 00:23:49,460
so burned out that they just like,
you know,

513
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:54,930
maybe he's young to the game.
Well there's a lot of young health was 

514
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:55,700
the vaporizer is certainly your best 
bet.

515
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,130
Bonds are nice.
I like a bond,

516
00:23:59,131 --> 00:23:59,870
right?
Glass.

517
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,610
Anything.
Brian doesn't give a fuck.

518
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:06,640
It goes right to the Dick joints,
joints because you only have to light at

519
00:24:07,101 --> 00:24:08,390
once.
No,

520
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:11,170
but really if you want to do it the 
healthiest way of vaporizers,

521
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:14,000
way to go and don't think that eating 
and it's just as healthy.

522
00:24:14,001 --> 00:24:16,070
People think that eating pot is just as 
healthy.

523
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,740
It is.
I mean it's not going to kill you,

524
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,120
but it will freak you out.

525
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:25,300
And one of the reasons why it freaks you
out because it produces this thing 

526
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,911
called 11 hydroxy.
It's a metabolite that your liver 

527
00:24:27,911 --> 00:24:30,941
produces when you eat marijuana and 
apparently it's not psychoactive when 

528
00:24:30,941 --> 00:24:35,831
you smoke it,
like it's so you don't get the same 

529
00:24:35,831 --> 00:24:37,691
effect,
but when you eat marijuana it becomes 

530
00:24:37,691 --> 00:24:38,870
like four times more psychoactive than 
if you smoke it.

531
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:41,420
So if you have like a lot of weed and 
you make brownies with them,

532
00:24:41,421 --> 00:24:43,120
that's the problem with these things.
You,

533
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,730
you eat a Brownie and you're like,
what the fuck are.

534
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,570
You can't believe how much weed is in 
it.

535
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:50,570
You have to sit down and it's because as
it's going through your system,

536
00:24:50,571 --> 00:24:52,880
it's creating this 11 hydroxy 
metabolite,

537
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,120
which I like.
And one of the reasons why I like it is 

538
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,240
because it's,
it makes me very self critical.

539
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:02,210
It makes me examine all sorts of things 
about myself.

540
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:05,330
Like there's anything about myself that 
I don't like.

541
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,950
If I'm being lazy,
if I'm being a douchebag,

542
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,120
if I'm being short with people,
if I'm not,

543
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:16,150
you know,
if I'm not focused on what I really 

544
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:16,490
should be focused on in my life,
anything that might be bugging me,

545
00:25:16,491 --> 00:25:20,660
my subconscious mind.
This 11 hydroxy makes you think about it

546
00:25:20,661 --> 00:25:25,661
like in depth and they can really freak 
people out if you've got some shit that 

547
00:25:25,661 --> 00:25:26,920
you're pushing in the back of your head.
You know?

548
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:28,640
It's like what people call.
I was paranoid.

549
00:25:28,641 --> 00:25:33,641
I was paranoid.
I think what paranoia is is people that 

550
00:25:33,641 --> 00:25:36,581
when you get high on marijuana,
I think we're paranoid is people who 

551
00:25:36,581 --> 00:25:37,400
just are there,
they're getting too much information for

552
00:25:37,401 --> 00:25:42,401
them to manage and they haven't done 
such a good job of managing their 

553
00:25:42,401 --> 00:25:44,240
consciousness in the first place and so 
when this stuff is hitting them,

554
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,560
what's happening is they're just.

555
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:48,650
It's overload and they can't control it 
and they freak out and they say,

556
00:25:48,651 --> 00:25:51,080
I can't smoke weed.
It gets me paranoid,

557
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:54,820
but I think it's more indicative of this
year.

558
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:57,260
You don't really know how you feel about
yourself.

559
00:25:57,261 --> 00:25:59,090
You don't really know how you feel about
life.

560
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:04,091
You're.
You're looking at life through barriers 

561
00:26:04,091 --> 00:26:07,091
because you're trying to not see 
everything because you're trying to 

562
00:26:07,091 --> 00:26:11,381
focus on one particular thing with your 
life or try and get your shit together 

563
00:26:11,381 --> 00:26:15,131
and you don't realize how many things 
about your life really are freaking you 

564
00:26:15,131 --> 00:26:17,390
out and bothering you until you smoke.
Pot and pot just makes you examine them.

565
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,240
You know,
we as,

566
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,360
as,
as people,

567
00:26:20,361 --> 00:26:25,361
we like to avoid shit that bugs us.
And so I like when people like overeat 

568
00:26:25,361 --> 00:26:29,981
to get over some childhood molestation.
They don't even fucking realize what 

569
00:26:29,981 --> 00:26:30,200
they're doing.
They're just distracting themselves with

570
00:26:30,201 --> 00:26:31,490
something else.
You know?

571
00:26:31,491 --> 00:26:36,491
I think.
I think we do shit like that all the 

572
00:26:36,491 --> 00:26:36,920
time.
Anything I kind of lost in near halfway.

573
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:42,560
Listen,
be careful with your weed.

574
00:26:42,561 --> 00:26:44,910
That's all I'm.
I'm being paranoid is a good thing.

575
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:45,900
It's for real.
It is.

576
00:26:45,901 --> 00:26:47,880
I mean,
the experience of being paranoid.

577
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:50,700
When you smoke weed,
it's to get you to look at yourself.

578
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,170
It's to get you to look at life.
It's,

579
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,430
you're not,
you're not.

580
00:26:53,431 --> 00:26:58,431
You're not looking at it all as clearly 
as you could and those jolts of 

581
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:04,250
perception.
You misinterpret as paranoia like what 

582
00:27:04,471 --> 00:27:07,620
you're doing is just dealing with the 
information that's already been there.

583
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:10,470
Just the fact that you're this fleshy,
temporary,

584
00:27:10,471 --> 00:27:15,471
soft,
mushy creature that is literally 

585
00:27:15,471 --> 00:27:18,140
connected with nothing above your head 
except gases and air and then fucking 

586
00:27:18,541 --> 00:27:23,541
space and above that there's asteroids 
and planets and fucking giant nuclear 

587
00:27:24,031 --> 00:27:29,031
explosions and sons and it's all right 
there and you're just this thing that 

588
00:27:29,031 --> 00:27:33,321
doesn't exactly know what it's doing is 
kind of going along with the flow of 

589
00:27:33,321 --> 00:27:36,660
everybody else and sit in traffic like 
everybody else hoping that someone of us

590
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,930
is like guiding this thing,
but they're not the ones guiding shit,

591
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:43,470
and that is if you're not thinking about
that,

592
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:48,500
if you don't,
you have an address that as a human 

593
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:48,600
being and you start eating fucking pot 
brownies,

594
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,820
that shit will pull up you over the 
head.

595
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:51,980
You'll freak out,
you'll,

596
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,220
you'll be scared.
You'll,

597
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:56,250
you'll curl into a fetal position.
You know like what?

598
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:01,280
What life really is is frightening to 
people and marijuana will expose the 

599
00:28:01,711 --> 00:28:04,410
fuck out of that.
Expose what it really is.

600
00:28:04,411 --> 00:28:06,180
You know,
this is not a goddamn moving.

601
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:11,540
That's the problem we are living life 
like it is a movie because we're 

602
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,290
fucking.
We really are programmed by culture.

603
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,910
I think.
I mean,

604
00:28:14,911 --> 00:28:16,620
I love movies.
Don't get me wrong.

605
00:28:16,621 --> 00:28:19,420
I love cds.
I love songs I love.

606
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,440
I love all forms of expression,
all entertaining forms of expression 

607
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,590
except dance,
dance,

608
00:28:25,591 --> 00:28:27,180
like a,
like musicals.

609
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:30,210
That doesn't mean shit to me.
I see choreographed dancing like,

610
00:28:30,211 --> 00:28:31,260
oh,
you're moving together.

611
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:35,200
You know,
you don't like a musical movies at all.

612
00:28:35,201 --> 00:28:39,050
Or South Park's uh,
yeah.

613
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,200
That was beautiful.

614
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:42,890
Beautiful.
Musical was beautiful.

615
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,270
I need to make a new south park movie.
What the fuck?

616
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,060
It's accept.
Canadians must have been very first,

617
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,690
right?
They're always right now.

618
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:54,300
Have you seen that?
That ginger video knows that when people

619
00:28:54,301 --> 00:28:56,460
are beaten up,
know this kid.

620
00:28:56,461 --> 00:28:57,660
He's a redhead and I thought,
man,

621
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:00,300
this kid is a redheaded.
Has come from.

622
00:29:00,301 --> 00:29:02,490
Where did you park?
That's crazy.

623
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:07,491
That's sad because there's an episode 
where like gingers were like some,

624
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:11,650
some kid was like right there.
South Park was like head a ginger day.

625
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:13,900
You're hitting them all day.
They're mimicking sapper.

626
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:14,280
What?
I mean,

627
00:29:14,281 --> 00:29:15,750
that's nothing new when you're in high 
school.

628
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:19,580
She used to beat the fuck out.
So that video is this,

629
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:23,280
this redheaded guy that gives like a 
speech for four minutes and it's kind of

630
00:29:23,281 --> 00:29:25,860
like leave Brittany alone style and it's
just,

631
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:30,940
it's you don't want your brings up God 
and religion through it and stuff and it

632
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:33,240
just sit there like terrified of this 
guy.

633
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:35,670
Not Bad for him.
I was just terrified.

634
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:38,550
And you got to watch it and maybe we'll 
set up for break or something.

635
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:40,770
He's fucking up the whole cause.
Yeah.

636
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:44,410
For other redheads,
redheads and one love crazy bitch.

637
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,210
That's the problem is by the time you 
know,

638
00:29:46,211 --> 00:29:47,800
you're,
you're out there looking for love.

639
00:29:47,801 --> 00:29:52,000
You're probably so God damn damaged.
Yes.

640
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,980
Most of us are fucking damaged.
Right?

641
00:29:53,981 --> 00:29:58,981
I mean if you had to,
if you had to guess like what amount of 

642
00:29:58,981 --> 00:29:58,981
people are still working on issues from 
a childhood?

643
00:29:58,981 --> 00:30:00,340
It's 100.
It's 100.

644
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,730
Yeah.
Timing really damaged.

645
00:30:01,731 --> 00:30:02,960
It's just,
that's what happens,

646
00:30:02,961 --> 00:30:03,230
you know?

647
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:08,340
Well,
it's also you have to reprogram the way 

648
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:08,340
you look at the world.
You know,

649
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,100
you look at the world a certain way 
because you think,

650
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:14,130
you know,
that's how you were taught by your 

651
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:14,130
parents and you know when you're like in
your teen years,

652
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:16,420
you start having to restructure things.
Your teen years,

653
00:30:16,421 --> 00:30:21,421
you start looking at things like they 
don't even know what the fuck they're 

654
00:30:21,421 --> 00:30:23,701
talking about.
They're talking crazy shit and you 

655
00:30:23,701 --> 00:30:23,701
realize God damn it.
My parents are just some fucking people.

656
00:30:23,701 --> 00:30:26,500
Just like all the other idiots.
I mean all day they just fucked.

657
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:31,700
Let's see.
There are no different than my idiot 

658
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,181
friends.
They're no different than my idiot 

659
00:30:33,181 --> 00:30:33,181
teachers.
They just fucked,

660
00:30:33,181 --> 00:30:33,880
they fucked and they made me and sell 
shit.

661
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:39,120
And so when those teenage years,
when you're trying to like reformulate 

662
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,021
the view,
that's when it starts and it continues 

663
00:30:43,021 --> 00:30:43,021
through your whole life,
you know?

664
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,160
Do you think that you would be the same 
dude though?

665
00:30:45,161 --> 00:30:46,360
If you had like A.
Oh,

666
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:51,430
I don't want to watch that stuff sold.
Do you think you would be the same dude 

667
00:30:51,671 --> 00:30:53,300
if you had a perfect childhood?
No,

668
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,280
I think it's just like that

669
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:57,720
you're a whole theory about like you 
are.

670
00:30:57,721 --> 00:30:58,980
How you lived,
you know,

671
00:30:58,981 --> 00:31:03,981
everyone starts off at the same person 
pretty much and just every single little

672
00:31:04,261 --> 00:31:06,510
thing you've got to believe that,
you know,

673
00:31:06,511 --> 00:31:09,120
it's like if you wrote down the hill,
you're going to in a mud,

674
00:31:09,121 --> 00:31:09,990
you're going to look different than 
yeah,

675
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:10,800
person next to you.
Yeah.

676
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,120
That's why people really have to have 
compassion because,

677
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,640
you know,
if you,

678
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:18,500
if we really are all the same thing,
this is my theory,

679
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:22,190
if you haven't heard it before.
And I had this when I was eight some pot

680
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:25,740
and it was on a boat in Hawaii and uh,
I was um,

681
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:31,210
on this boat and we were,
we were fishing and there was dolphins 

682
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:32,600
that were next to the book.
The dolphins were playing with us.

683
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:37,630
They would get by the boat and they 
would jump up in the air and we would 

684
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:37,630
go,
whoa.

685
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,160
And every time they jump up there and we
go,

686
00:31:39,161 --> 00:31:40,000
what's up,
what's up,

687
00:31:40,001 --> 00:31:43,240
what's up top?
And when we would do that,

688
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:46,150
they would get excited.
And so they were like showing off.

689
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,220
They were like communicating with us.
I was like,

690
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:50,140
God damn,
there's so conscious.

691
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:52,810
And I started thinking about it like 
they're responding to us.

692
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:55,720
I'm like,
I wonder what life must be like,

693
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:58,030
what consciousness wants to be like for 
the Dolphin.

694
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:01,120
And I wonder if it's similar to humans 
and I wonder if it's the same.

695
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:06,360
I was thinking,
I wonder if they have the exact same 

696
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,371
consciousness.
It's just filtered through an entirely 

697
00:32:08,371 --> 00:32:08,620
different environment.
It totally different skin.

698
00:32:08,621 --> 00:32:13,621
You know,
you're in a fish's body and a totally 

699
00:32:13,621 --> 00:32:13,810
different way of communicating and 
totally different language that's almost

700
00:32:13,811 --> 00:32:16,660
indecipherable.
But what if it's exactly the same thing,

701
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:19,470
the inside the consciousness.
And then I thought about it,

702
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,360
I'm like,
oh my God.

703
00:32:20,361 --> 00:32:22,240
Like what if that's the case with 
people?

704
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,030
What if we are all exactly the same 
thing?

705
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:29,140
We just are transmitted through 
different biological filters,

706
00:32:29,141 --> 00:32:31,780
different life experiences,
different childhoods,

707
00:32:31,781 --> 00:32:35,020
different everything,
different bad genetic rolls of the dice.

708
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:40,020
I mean people are born with different 
ailments and diseases and people are 

709
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:40,140
born crippled.
You know what,

710
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:45,150
what?
The reason why I supposed to have 

711
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:45,150
compassionate is that easily could have 
been you.

712
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:49,160
It's,
it's just a like a filter that the 

713
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,870
consciousness is going through.
But the consciousness is one thing,

714
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:54,020
it's all the same.
You are just like me.

715
00:32:54,021 --> 00:32:59,021
It's just like any of your uniqueness 
has to do with your biology and your 

716
00:32:59,021 --> 00:33:00,830
interpretations of your experiences as 
you're growing up.

717
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,820
You know,
your unique personality,

718
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:07,920
your unique personality that everybody 
talks about when were a child could 

719
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,530
easily be attributed to what kind of 
machine you're running.

720
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,880
You know,
only take something.

721
00:33:10,881 --> 00:33:13,760
Everybody's biology is different.
You know that if you watch porn,

722
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:19,030
right?
There's people that we're blessed with 

723
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,030
gigantic decks and there's poor dudes 
with little tiny decks and there's girls

724
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:23,270
with incredible bodies and there's other
girls that like whatever,

725
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,570
no matter what they do,
they can't lose that last 20 pounds.

726
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,810
That's just fact that that is what it is
you're born with.

727
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,900
There's variables like this variables 
with oranges,

728
00:33:32,901 --> 00:33:35,540
you'll see one orange as big and another
one that's not so big.

729
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:40,720
They're not all the same and these 
various chemicals and then on top of 

730
00:33:41,301 --> 00:33:43,670
these various chemicals that are all in 
balance,

731
00:33:43,671 --> 00:33:46,310
all these different hormones.
When a top of that,

732
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:51,340
then it's like,
how does this particular model interact 

733
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,160
with its environment,
your own unique experiences?

734
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:57,280
I mean,
how many times have you seen something 

735
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:57,280
that your friends didn't and it fucked 
you up for the rest of the day.

736
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:57,920
You know,
you know,

737
00:33:57,921 --> 00:34:02,921
like you see somebody get hit by a car,
you see something and then you have the 

738
00:34:02,921 --> 00:34:06,071
same friends.
You go to the same and all of a sudden 

739
00:34:06,071 --> 00:34:06,071
you don't want to hang out with them 
anymore.

740
00:34:06,071 --> 00:34:06,071
You think that things are frivolous.

741
00:34:06,071 --> 00:34:07,390
You think they're being retarded.
You know,

742
00:34:07,391 --> 00:34:12,391
you hear about a girl getting raped and 
you're the one who freaks out and it's 

743
00:34:12,391 --> 00:34:15,550
what you see one thing and it will set 
you off in a certain direction and it's 

744
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:19,831
like,
so who the fuck knows what your 

745
00:34:19,831 --> 00:34:21,701
personality is?
You know who the fuck knows how much of 

746
00:34:21,701 --> 00:34:22,350
it is your body?
How much of it is your experiences?

747
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:27,370
How much of it is what you learned from 
your parents and how much of theirs is 

748
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:28,160
the same shit?
How much of your personalities is really

749
00:34:28,161 --> 00:34:33,161
just you reacting and saying what you 
have to say and doing what you have to 

750
00:34:33,161 --> 00:34:37,451
do to get by in your environment,
but at the core of everybody from 

751
00:34:37,451 --> 00:34:39,920
fucking serial killers to to the most 
compassionate people on Earth,

752
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:43,040
it's very likely that the consciousness 
is the same male,

753
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:44,870
female.
That's all biological.

754
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:48,490
It's very logical that the thinking.
It's very possible that the,

755
00:34:48,491 --> 00:34:51,020
the root of it all.
When you think about yourself as you,

756
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:53,750
that it's all the same.
That's nuts.

757
00:34:55,190 --> 00:35:00,190
That's nuts.
Somehow cats involved with that shit.

758
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:05,330
Some shit.
And it's really interesting because then

759
00:35:05,331 --> 00:35:07,220
when there's like personality test on 
websites,

760
00:35:07,221 --> 00:35:08,990
like there's dating websites we're 
talking about.

761
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:12,380
So like there's,
you take personality tests so you're all

762
00:35:12,381 --> 00:35:14,640
trying to take a test that's based on 
what,

763
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,170
you know the person,
you know,

764
00:35:16,171 --> 00:35:16,790
like,
you know,

765
00:35:16,791 --> 00:35:19,870
how did they know it's personal 
interests or stupid as fuck.

766
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:23,120
I just like same people that have 
glitter tags on their mind space,

767
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:24,780
you know,
what are you taking it?

768
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:29,790
You don't know what you're fucking 
personalities like once you go sit down 

769
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:29,790
in the grass by yourself.
And think about shit,

770
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:34,630
you know,
take a goddamn meditation class at a 

771
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:37,061
certain point in time as a human being 
human being to become responsible for 

772
00:35:37,061 --> 00:35:37,061
your own biology,
you know,

773
00:35:37,061 --> 00:35:38,340
and that's what we don't teach people 
well,

774
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:39,780
we need to teach kids in school.

775
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:40,890
There needs to be,
you know,

776
00:35:40,891 --> 00:35:43,800
you have math and you have English and 
these are all very important subjects,

777
00:35:43,801 --> 00:35:46,350
but we also need is how to manage your 
mind,

778
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:48,810
how to think,
how to think correctly,

779
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:51,180
how to,
when something comes up in your life,

780
00:35:51,181 --> 00:35:53,670
how to deal with it and turn it into 
something,

781
00:35:53,671 --> 00:35:56,970
to your advantage.
How not to go into a negative spiral and

782
00:35:56,971 --> 00:36:00,000
have your whole fucking life fall apart 
because of one thing and that that's.

783
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:03,420
These are very important that people 
learn how to think,

784
00:36:03,421 --> 00:36:05,340
how to control your mind.
You know,

785
00:36:05,341 --> 00:36:08,460
and how many people actually do that.
It's not that many,

786
00:36:08,461 --> 00:36:13,461
right?
I mean there's not that many people 

787
00:36:13,461 --> 00:36:13,461
really know how to think.
You know,

788
00:36:13,461 --> 00:36:16,970
how to think positively,
how to effect the people around you as 

789
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:19,881
positively as you can.
How to move your life into the way you 

790
00:36:19,881 --> 00:36:20,550
move your life into a healthy place.

791
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:25,580
Very hard to do.
It's because we're all starting from 

792
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:25,580
scratch.
You know,

793
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,190
we're all starting from scratch where 
I'll try to read books.

794
00:36:26,191 --> 00:36:27,750
We were never taught that shit in 
school.

795
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:32,930
They'd be,
if they really want to teach you how to 

796
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:32,930
be a good employee,
how to,

797
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:33,420
you know,
make a good living.

798
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:37,590
That's you being a better person.
Being better at being a person,

799
00:36:37,591 --> 00:36:39,900
being better at managing your life is 
very important.

800
00:36:39,901 --> 00:36:42,120
They should be teaching kids how to 
think correctly,

801
00:36:42,121 --> 00:36:47,121
like early in school and they should 
have discipline and I don't mean 

802
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:47,121
discipline by like,
you know,

803
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:52,190
do what everybody tells you to do.
That's not discipline with discipline 

804
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:52,860
is,
is you have to do a certain amount.

805
00:36:52,861 --> 00:36:54,930
You have to do something like do 
anything.

806
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,070
Anything that's really hard,
like whether it's swimming or archery or

807
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,180
playing chess or you know,
doing Jujitsu for kids,

808
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:06,300
having something that's difficult to do 
is very important.

809
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,130
They need to be pushed.
You know,

810
00:37:08,131 --> 00:37:09,330
it's very,
very important.

811
00:37:09,331 --> 00:37:14,331
You could develop so much more of who 
you are if you've already pushed your 

812
00:37:14,331 --> 00:37:15,000
boundaries.
If you're been lazy,

813
00:37:15,001 --> 00:37:17,760
your whole life is so hard to get out of
not being lazy anymore,

814
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:20,310
and this is all shit that they should be
teaching in school,

815
00:37:20,311 --> 00:37:25,311
man.
It should totally be teaching that shit 

816
00:37:25,311 --> 00:37:25,311
in school,
you know,

817
00:37:25,311 --> 00:37:25,440
and it's not just history.
You know,

818
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:27,000
when I was a kid,
they fucking taught us.

819
00:37:27,001 --> 00:37:29,060
Columbus discovered America,
you know,

820
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:32,610
that was still being taught and now we 
know for a fact he didn't it.

821
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,750
I think it still is,
isn't it?

822
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:35,250
I don't think so.
Really.

823
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:36,540
I mean he's,
he's still,

824
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:41,630
we celebrate Columbus Day,
but I think now they say he landed in 

825
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:41,630
the West indies.
That's what your question was.

826
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:46,530
Was the gentlemen,
are we serious about our dolphin stuff?

827
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:47,250
Yeah,
man.

828
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:49,230
Dolphins rape other dolphins.
Oh,

829
00:37:49,231 --> 00:37:50,640
I know they do.
They do.

830
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,460
They rape other dolphins.
They eat dolphin babies.

831
00:37:53,461 --> 00:37:54,660
It's that,
you know,

832
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:59,990
infanticide and dolphins.
I think that's what it's called is what 

833
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:04,071
they do is the female dolphins try to 
fuck as many male dolphins as they can 

834
00:38:04,071 --> 00:38:08,240
because if they run across a male 
dolphin that they haven't fucked and 

835
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,901
they have babies,
the male might kill the babies to get 

836
00:38:11,901 --> 00:38:14,070
the female to breed because the females 
won't breed while they're taking care of

837
00:38:14,071 --> 00:38:19,071
the young,
so they have to fuck as many male 

838
00:38:19,071 --> 00:38:21,420
dolphins as they can so that when they 
do come across a male dolphin and he's,

839
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,670
he sees him with the baby.
If she fucked him,

840
00:38:23,671 --> 00:38:25,750
he won't kill the babies because he 
doesn't know if they're his.

841
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:28,290
It's crazy humans,
you know,

842
00:38:28,291 --> 00:38:31,820
rape and kill babies too.
Yeah.

843
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:32,280
Yeah.

844
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,800
I mean we don't do it in such large 
numbers as dolphins though I dolphins do

845
00:38:35,801 --> 00:38:37,870
it,
like kind of like as a matter of,

846
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:43,200
you know,
they're more board they're need in the 

847
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:43,200
water on.
They're like,

848
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:43,840
but we don't have.
I think it's that the board.

849
00:38:43,841 --> 00:38:46,750
I think it's that they can affect their 
environment.

850
00:38:46,751 --> 00:38:49,870
We see evolution in dolphins and it's in
a very strange scale.

851
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,690
It's very much different than ours.
It's like they're,

852
00:38:51,691 --> 00:38:54,280
they're super intelligent and cognitive,
you know,

853
00:38:54,281 --> 00:38:59,281
they,
they have these amazing abilities to 

854
00:38:59,281 --> 00:39:00,901
communicate,
but yet they can't move anything with 

855
00:39:00,901 --> 00:39:00,901
their hands.
They don't create anything.

856
00:39:00,901 --> 00:39:01,530
So they're out in the wild.
So their,

857
00:39:01,531 --> 00:39:03,880
their world is just way harsher.
They're basically,

858
00:39:03,881 --> 00:39:07,060
dolphins are like the fucking blue 
people in Avatar,

859
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:12,420
you know,
the blue people and advertiser like 

860
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:12,420
super intelligent,
but they're,

861
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:12,420
these motherfuckers live in the jungle.
You got to be hard,

862
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:17,250
you know,
like some soft dude behind a computer 

863
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:17,250
keyboard,
you know,

864
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:17,250
you've got to be like that crazy.

865
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:18,940
But shooting arrows at those crazy black
dog things,

866
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:19,810
you know.
And that's.

867
00:39:19,811 --> 00:39:20,770
The dolphins are like,
man,

868
00:39:20,771 --> 00:39:22,780
they're in the fucking woods there in 
the ocean.

869
00:39:22,781 --> 00:39:24,410
But that's,
there's sharks out there.

870
00:39:24,411 --> 00:39:27,820
And men show killer whales eat dolphins 
all the time.

871
00:39:27,821 --> 00:39:29,740
They're cousins.
Madison's your cousin eight.

872
00:39:29,741 --> 00:39:33,040
You killer whales will fuck up some 
dolphins.

873
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:36,400
They fuck up sharks to kill the whales 
of the pimps have the ocean.

874
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,380
They're just running shit.
You know,

875
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,600
they don't take shit from nobody.
You know,

876
00:39:40,601 --> 00:39:45,601
the only people they do is people.
That's the only thing that they take 

877
00:39:45,601 --> 00:39:45,690
shit from because people,
this is a,

878
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,670
a store that I read on the Internet and 
this I would like to add,

879
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:51,670
ask you twitter people and people are 
watching on ustream.

880
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:55,680
I wonder if um,
if it's,

881
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:57,400
if it's possible that this is a true 
story.

882
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:02,640
What I heard was that the orcas or 
killer whales used to attack people and 

883
00:40:02,861 --> 00:40:04,390
been attacking people for a long time.

884
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:07,360
But then after World War Two they 
stopped.

885
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:12,660
And one of the reasons why it's this 
American soldiers were apparently I'm 

886
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,280
targeting killer whales in the ocean for
practice.

887
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:17,420
You know,
that's how they would work on their.

888
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:21,490
They're shooting out of the planes and 
they would drop bombs on them and shit.

889
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,070
The whales just completely stopped 
eating people.

890
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,420
I mean,
that doesn't,

891
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:27,520
that seems like something somebody made 
up,

892
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:28,630
right?
Doesn't it?

893
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:31,750
But what if it wasn't.
That would be pretty fucking crazy,

894
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,220
you know,
because I know culture is,

895
00:40:33,221 --> 00:40:36,190
do have like images,
like old eskimo images,

896
00:40:36,191 --> 00:40:37,990
just like a killer whale attacking 
people.

897
00:40:37,991 --> 00:40:40,240
Like really ancient stuff.
I wonder.

898
00:40:40,241 --> 00:40:42,010
A hippie.
Interesting.

899
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,230
And they knew what was up.
You know,

900
00:40:44,231 --> 00:40:49,231
if like other goal of these 
motherfuckers can fly now and trap 

901
00:40:49,231 --> 00:40:49,231
shifts when was okay,
we're good.

902
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:50,890
We're done.
Just we tap.

903
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,720
Imagine if they eat everything else,
why would they eat?

904
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:56,800
People?
They save people all the time.

905
00:40:57,010 --> 00:41:02,010
Like that's really nutty when you're 
talking about an animal that's that 

906
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:02,010
intelligent,
like murders,

907
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:02,890
Dolphin.
When people fall in the ocean,

908
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:07,920
killer whales have been known and many 
times to nudge people towards boats and 

909
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:07,920
help them.
Yeah.

910
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:09,490
Crazy.
Yeah.

911
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:14,650
Same as dolphins.
Then none of them fuck with people 

912
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:14,650
because we have the ability to change 
our environment.

913
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:18,490
They're just as ruthless just as smart,
but they're fucked with their bodies.

914
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,060
A little fucking flippers and shit the 
fuck you up if you're in their world,

915
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,950
but that's what you need to get by in 
their world.

916
00:41:23,951 --> 00:41:26,500
Our world requires much more finer 
moves,

917
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:28,990
you know,
and our ability to manipulate shit.

918
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:32,500
Like had things gone just a little bit 
different in evolution.

919
00:41:32,501 --> 00:41:37,501
If you believe in evolution,
you know the dolphins and easily they 

920
00:41:37,501 --> 00:41:38,600
can easily be and shit the killer whales
and dolphins.

921
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:40,370
Imagine if there was something like that
with us,

922
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:43,250
if those were all the same intelligence,
imagine there's something like that with

923
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:45,590
us,
like some giant trolls that were just as

924
00:41:45,591 --> 00:41:47,540
smart as us and would come in and kill 
people.

925
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,060
Show up at your village and start eating
us.

926
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,880
Jack in us.
Well,

927
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:54,140
there is happening.
That's us and monkeys.

928
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:54,950
Beowulf.
Well,

929
00:41:54,951 --> 00:41:59,951
that's us in monkeys.
If you look at like African countries 

930
00:41:59,951 --> 00:42:03,190
Bushmeat,
you see the cell chimpanzee hands his 

931
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:05,881
ass trays and shit.
They just go into the forest and fuck 

932
00:42:05,881 --> 00:42:06,050
those things up and eat them.
You know?

933
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,570
That's pretty crazy when you think,
God,

934
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:10,130
what other?
Something like that with us.

935
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,110
That could happen,
man.

936
00:42:12,111 --> 00:42:13,460
Nothing can happen.
Well,

937
00:42:13,461 --> 00:42:15,980
we didn't like.
Can you fucking imagine?

938
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:18,470
I mean there is.
There are predators,

939
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:23,560
humans if you're around them,
but you know,

940
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,070
for the most part they're not 
intelligent.

941
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:28,100
These fucking things are intelligent 
killer whales or just the smartest.

942
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:33,220
Often their genius.
They're like the smartest human 

943
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:33,220
supposedly.
Well,

944
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:33,220
if that's the case,
man,

945
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:36,860
you imagine subject as smart as people,
but giant and likes to eat us.

946
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:38,420
Robots.
No,

947
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,330
it's going to be.
We're going to go,

948
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,970
we're going to build our enemy,
our Predator,

949
00:42:43,971 --> 00:42:48,971
we're going to build our predator.
Some some new months are going to come 

950
00:42:48,971 --> 00:42:52,001
from the sky.
We would never be able to get to this 

951
00:42:52,001 --> 00:42:54,101
point.
The reason why we've got to this point 

952
00:42:54,101 --> 00:42:56,060
culture or with technology and with our 
inventions and all the shit,

953
00:42:56,061 --> 00:42:57,740
the reason why it's because no one's 
been eating us.

954
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:03,040
We've had all this downtime with all 
this downtime to come up with things 

955
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:03,620
because otherwise we would've never 
gotten to this point.

956
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:05,420
He never be comfortable enough to sit 
around,

957
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:10,540
crunching algorithms,
trying to figure out how to make a 

958
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:10,540
pentium processor.

959
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:13,660
You would never get to that point.
You'd be constantly running from the 

960
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:13,760
giant troll people that want to eat your
asshole.

961
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:19,230
You know,
they were just kill people and the way 

962
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:19,230
chimps eat monkeys.
You ever watched the which Mc?

963
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:22,520
Hammer parties and while they're alive 
they don't tell them.

964
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:27,820
That's a weird thing about predators 
seem to kill people and then eat them 

965
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:30,170
like big cats.
You know,

966
00:43:30,171 --> 00:43:31,020
like,
you know,

967
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:33,350
animals that like kill things for a 
living.

968
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:34,460
You know,
like big cats,

969
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:39,490
big cats,
they only eat grass so they can throw 

970
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:39,490
up.
That's all they do.

971
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:39,800
And these,
uh,

972
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:40,940
these animals,
when they,

973
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:42,860
when they catch something,
it's very important that they kill it.

974
00:43:42,861 --> 00:43:44,450
So they just grabbed him by the neck.
And Jack,

975
00:43:44,451 --> 00:43:46,010
I'm immediately.
But like,

976
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,770
chimps don't do that.
Chimps eat berries,

977
00:43:48,771 --> 00:43:50,480
they eat all kinds of shit.
They're omnivores.

978
00:43:50,481 --> 00:43:53,240
They can eat meat or vegetables and 
fruits.

979
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:57,560
So when they kill monkeys,
which is like their favorite shit to do,

980
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,170
they love monkeys,
they love to eat them.

981
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:02,990
And they have all these elaborate traps 
where they,

982
00:44:02,991 --> 00:44:03,400
uh,
there's,

983
00:44:03,401 --> 00:44:04,520
you can see them online,
will,

984
00:44:04,521 --> 00:44:09,521
will find you the youtube clip.
I'll find it right now because it's 

985
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:10,330
pretty fucking trippy.
It's a youtube.

986
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,800
I'm just going to youtube chimps,
eat monkeys and a,

987
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:17,690
my point is they,
they eat them alive,

988
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,580
man.
They eat them alive,

989
00:44:19,581 --> 00:44:20,930
they rip them apart,
they don't kill him.

990
00:44:20,931 --> 00:44:22,730
First it,
same thing with bears.

991
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:25,070
Bears ever see like a bear when it,
uh,

992
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:26,930
like that's the thing about that Timothy
Treadwell.

993
00:44:26,931 --> 00:44:28,370
Dude,
that dude from grizzly man,

994
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:33,660
the fucking video or the is there's a 
cap on the video when the bear ate them,

995
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:36,970
but the audio is there in the audience.
Seven minutes long,

996
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:39,580
seven minutes long.
Is that not leaked yet?

997
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:44,640
Seven minute.
Because the the woman who was his 

998
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:44,640
girlfriend didn't want it to leak.
If you don't,

999
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,690
if you haven't seen grizzly man,
you must.

1000
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:47,800
You must.
Secrets who?

1001
00:44:47,801 --> 00:44:52,801
Matt is one of the most genius fucking 
movies ever and it's like a subtle 

1002
00:44:53,561 --> 00:44:54,910
comedy.
It's,

1003
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:58,330
I mean it's so hard to describe.
This guy was so insane and he was living

1004
00:44:58,331 --> 00:45:03,331
with bears and the way it's edited 
together and Werner Herzog is typically 

1005
00:45:03,331 --> 00:45:04,210
not known for making funny movies.
Right?

1006
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:07,480
He's like a serious director.
I don't think he meant to make this fun,

1007
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:11,500
but this guy is so ridiculous.
He's have like a bear.

1008
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:12,850
Come here,
come here.

1009
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:17,880
He's gay.
Or then Ricky Martin in a room full of 

1010
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:17,880
dicks.
He's,

1011
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:22,290
he's says this guy is so gay and he's 
out there in the woods with a camera 

1012
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:26,281
going,
if I was gay I could just meet a girl 

1013
00:45:26,281 --> 00:45:26,650
and we could just.
Or can you meet a guy and a restroom?

1014
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:29,530
We can just hook up that I'm not gay.
So what do I do?

1015
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,140
Want to bring it up.
It wouldn't do it in specific.

1016
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:34,030
I just go to a restaurant,
right?

1017
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:35,440
Like,
why is a great movie?

1018
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:37,930
I need to refinance tastic movie grizzly
man,

1019
00:45:37,931 --> 00:45:38,770
you have to see it.

1020
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:43,480
But this guy was like really into saving
the grizzly bears.

1021
00:45:43,481 --> 00:45:45,760
So he's up there in Alaska and he's 
like,

1022
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:50,870
you know,
the fucking park rangers now he's 

1023
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:51,550
motherfuckers out here saving him 
everyday and the bears are looking like,

1024
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:54,640
who is this crazy bitch?
Like they weren't anything.

1025
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:56,290
It was letting people know the bears 
were there,

1026
00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:58,720
but they knew bears were there.
Like he wasn't saving them.

1027
00:45:58,721 --> 00:46:00,130
They're at a national park,
you know,

1028
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:03,370
occasionally there's a poaching,
but that's going to happen everywhere.

1029
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:05,100
They're not going to not poach because 
you're there.

1030
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:06,550
Stupid,
you know.

1031
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,240
Okay.
Here,

1032
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:10,290
chimps killing and eating a monkey.
I'm going to take this.

1033
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,340
Yeah,
this is the one.

1034
00:46:11,341 --> 00:46:12,770
It's ruthless.
Ooh.

1035
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:18,170
I'll take this link and I'll throw it up
on twitter right now from a peoples when

1036
00:46:22,221 --> 00:46:27,221
I'm really high.
I can't type that good if I think about 

1037
00:46:27,221 --> 00:46:27,221
it.

1038
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:30,020
Uh,
let me

1039
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:32,150
into the zoo.
The Los Angeles Zoo.

1040
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:37,660
Yeah.
I don't like to go to the zoo after the 

1041
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:39,881
last time I went,
I wrote that piece about the zoo animal 

1042
00:46:39,881 --> 00:46:39,881
prison on,
in the blog.

1043
00:46:39,881 --> 00:46:42,110
But I realized because I was super baked
and when,

1044
00:46:42,111 --> 00:46:42,660
uh,
you know,

1045
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:47,700
like when I,
like we were talking about earlier when 

1046
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:49,511
you super bait dealing much more 
sensitive than I was watching these 

1047
00:46:49,511 --> 00:46:49,511
animals.
I'm like,

1048
00:46:49,511 --> 00:46:53,441
this is a horrendous life.
Just because they can move doesn't mean 

1049
00:46:53,441 --> 00:46:56,171
they're alive.
They don't allow the predators to kill 

1050
00:46:56,171 --> 00:46:56,171
and eat.
That's like the,

1051
00:46:56,171 --> 00:46:57,840
the,
they take you away and eat,

1052
00:46:57,841 --> 00:46:59,870
you know,
you can't talk to people ever again.

1053
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:00,690
You know,
you just,

1054
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,560
you get locked up in a room by yourself 
and,

1055
00:47:02,561 --> 00:47:05,090
and something else other than you has to
stare at you.

1056
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:06,980
Right.
And you don't even get a,

1057
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:08,640
you don't get to,
you know,

1058
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,660
the one pleasure that animals that are 
predators get.

1059
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:15,110
I mean the reason why they go after the,
the kill,

1060
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:19,310
it must be orgasmic.
I mean it's what they need to stay alive

1061
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:24,580
and they're doing it with their mouth 
and they're feeling the life leave the 

1062
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:25,340
animal.
And I mean it's,

1063
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:29,030
it's imperative for them to be really 
awesome at killing things in,

1064
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:32,680
for them to survive.
So what must that feel like to them?

1065
00:47:32,681 --> 00:47:35,500
It must be incredible when it feels good
for us to fuck.

1066
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:37,300
And there's so many of us.
It's like,

1067
00:47:37,301 --> 00:47:39,790
it's not even important that we fuck,
you know what I'm saying?

1068
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:44,470
But it's your body is so programmed by 
all the years of evolution to think that

1069
00:47:44,471 --> 00:47:46,720
it's very,
very important to make new human being.

1070
00:47:46,721 --> 00:47:49,240
So you get this fantastic reward when 
you fuck.

1071
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:51,830
It just feels so good.
And what it really is,

1072
00:47:51,831 --> 00:47:53,650
it's just nature trying to trick you 
nature,

1073
00:47:53,651 --> 00:47:58,651
making sure that you're rewarded for 
doing what you have to do to stay alive 

1074
00:47:58,651 --> 00:48:00,460
and to continue to race well with a 
Jaguar every day.

1075
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:03,190
You have to kill some shit.
The fucking,

1076
00:48:03,191 --> 00:48:08,191
the physical rush,
the sensation of chasing something down 

1077
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:11,940
as it's running through the forest.
Not sure if you're going to get it and 

1078
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:15,040
sometimes they get away and Bam,
you got that motherfucker right by the 

1079
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:18,841
neck.
He feel a heartbeat and it's legs are 

1080
00:48:18,841 --> 00:48:18,841
kicking and just put that little 
antelope down.

1081
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:24,780
That must be fantastic.
It must be fantastic and you don't even 

1082
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:28,141
give him that.
You just put them in this cage and you 

1083
00:48:28,141 --> 00:48:28,630
slide cold meat in a tray and he eats it
and she was like,

1084
00:48:28,631 --> 00:48:33,631
what the fuck?
What the fuck did I do to deserve this 

1085
00:48:33,631 --> 00:48:34,870
mean?
If you've got to keep them around,

1086
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:39,960
I could see the argument much more to 
kill all the predators than I could to 

1087
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:42,380
keep any of them around in cages,
you know,

1088
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,080
because I could see what you're saying.
Listen,

1089
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:47,560
we're going to get some video of all 
these animals that can eat us.

1090
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:52,830
We'll get some nice video,
documented a bunch of different formats 

1091
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:55,590
and peg mov put an iphone and then we're
going to kill them.

1092
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,340
We're going to kill all of them.
Anything that kills us,

1093
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:59,010
but why not?
What if they were to do it?

1094
00:48:59,011 --> 00:49:04,011
Like they had a huge open crazy space 
and they made it kind of like fun and 

1095
00:49:04,011 --> 00:49:05,970
everything that they would want,
but then they would like throw on like,

1096
00:49:05,971 --> 00:49:07,830
all right,
here's a cow onto the situation.

1097
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:10,420
Yeah.
No,

1098
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:12,430
I don't know.
I don't think you want them.

1099
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:15,370
The problem is people don't want to see 
that shit.

1100
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:18,250
How about in the day?
I mean,

1101
00:49:18,251 --> 00:49:20,830
if you're going to do instead,
if you really want to teach children,

1102
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:26,030
why is it okay?
It's kind of funny because why is it 

1103
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:28,351
okay to watch something like that on the
National Geographic show on discovery 

1104
00:49:28,351 --> 00:49:28,900
channel?
They show you all the time.

1105
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:33,220
Have you ever seen relentless enemies?
Uh,

1106
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:38,310
maybe.
I'm pretty sure it's called relentless 

1107
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:38,310
enemies.
It's a fucking amazing documentary about

1108
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:42,610
these lions in Africa that are.
They look like cartoon lines.

1109
00:49:42,611 --> 00:49:43,480
There are a lot like,
like,

1110
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:48,690
like giant Mike Tyson lines that it's so
ridiculous and the females are bigger 

1111
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:53,260
than normal African male lions or as 
big,

1112
00:49:53,261 --> 00:49:55,960
if not bigger than normal African male 
lines,

1113
00:49:55,961 --> 00:49:58,960
which is an unprecedented mean.
It never exists.

1114
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:04,140
These fucking lions are gigantic and the
reason why they're gigantic is because 

1115
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:08,851
they the river where they live changed 
course about a hundred years ago and 

1116
00:50:08,851 --> 00:50:08,851
all.

1117
00:50:08,851 --> 00:50:12,280
I may not even be 100,
it might have been more recent than now.

1118
00:50:12,281 --> 00:50:17,281
I have to look it up,
but they got stuck on this one island 

1119
00:50:17,281 --> 00:50:20,860
with water buffalo only water buffalo.
So in order to survive,

1120
00:50:20,861 --> 00:50:23,410
they had an only killed the toughest 
thing to kill.

1121
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:27,440
So these giant fucking water buffaloes 
are dangerous as fuck.

1122
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:32,710
They're super powerful.
They've got these giant horns and 

1123
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:35,261
they'll come at you and stomp your ass 
and they get broken legs and they can't 

1124
00:50:35,261 --> 00:50:36,110
hunt again and then the fucking they 
starve to death.

1125
00:50:36,111 --> 00:50:39,170
So it's a fucking dangerous proposition.
Will these ants,

1126
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:43,130
these,
these tigers got gigantic because of it.

1127
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:46,790
They got fucking huge and it's really 
fascinating,

1128
00:50:46,791 --> 00:50:51,791
man.
Really fascinating to watch them try to 

1129
00:50:51,791 --> 00:50:54,550
figure out how they're going to take out
these water buffalo and they're just so 

1130
00:50:54,550 --> 00:50:54,770
much bigger than regular lions.
It's like,

1131
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:57,620
it's crazy to watch man.
Really,

1132
00:50:57,621 --> 00:50:58,940
really intense documentary.

1133
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:03,700
You're a huge documentary.
You'd like how many documentaries a talk

1134
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:06,590
to you?
A lot of them.

1135
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:09,680
Yeah.
Is it because you're just like science?

1136
00:51:09,681 --> 00:51:11,060
Have you always liked science?

1137
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:12,500
I,
I do.

1138
00:51:12,501 --> 00:51:15,230
I just get fascinated by shit man.
You know what I mean?

1139
00:51:15,231 --> 00:51:17,240
Just the fact that that exists.
I mean if you,

1140
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:22,270
how many people have their new approach,
but a lot of you guys knew about those 

1141
00:51:22,270 --> 00:51:23,210
lines in Africa,
but you know,

1142
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:28,270
he talked to her because you're on the 
Internet and Shit and you're savvy 

1143
00:51:28,270 --> 00:51:31,001
enough to be on the youth stream.
But like how many fucking people really 

1144
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:32,490
you know,
know,

1145
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:36,170
know anything about the animal world or 
space or you know,

1146
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:41,550
mean you start seeing things about like 
hyper Novas they blow up like 

1147
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:42,800
everything,
like within,

1148
00:51:42,801 --> 00:51:47,801
you know,
100 million fucking light years and 

1149
00:51:47,801 --> 00:51:48,290
everything gets cooked and they happen 
all the time throughout the galaxy.

1150
00:51:48,291 --> 00:51:49,100
And you're like,
what?

1151
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:51,800
Like what is this?
They talk about how they can.

1152
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:55,670
If one happened like anywhere near us,
we'd be cooked instantly.

1153
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,610
Like it just blows everything apart all 
around it.

1154
00:51:58,611 --> 00:52:03,611
Like this insane event where these 
spirals of energy blast out from the 

1155
00:52:03,611 --> 00:52:08,441
sides and it's been,
it's fucking nuts and it happens like 

1156
00:52:08,441 --> 00:52:12,040
hundreds a day all over the universe.
Tuesday it's like,

1157
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:16,760
to not be into documentaries to me seems
way crazier than to be into them.

1158
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:20,720
There's so much nerdy shit going on out 
there and no one cares.

1159
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:23,070
You know the new season of losses,
right?

1160
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:24,310
About the stock.
Oh yeah.

1161
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:26,540
I read.
I can't wait for that though.

1162
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:29,940
Every time I see that commercial,
I'm just like,

1163
00:52:29,941 --> 00:52:31,710
Oh God.
There was one second avenue.

1164
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:37,550
The documentary on the Lions folks.
I think it's called relentless enemies.

1165
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:38,630
Let me,
let me check right now.

1166
00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:45,130
What is that thing you?
You're saying you have to smoke 

1167
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:45,130
cigarettes.

1168
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:45,130
Oh No,
no.

1169
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:45,170
I'm Jonesing for last.
Oh,

1170
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:47,390
but did you know,
did you hear somebody hit by a.

1171
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,550
They want.
This is how dumb somebody whites went to

1172
00:52:49,551 --> 00:52:53,630
go get the nicotine patches and they 
wanted to quit smoking faster.

1173
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:58,660
So they put every single one of the 
nicotine patches on their body that you 

1174
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:01,970
know,
you get a box of them and they thought 

1175
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:01,970
that if they put more patches on their 
body,

1176
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:02,670
so suck.
And here's,

1177
00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:05,790
here's,
I can show you this right here.

1178
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:10,140
It's called relentless enemies is the 
the documentary on the and now here,

1179
00:53:10,141 --> 00:53:12,360
this is how bad people suck.
This fucking guy,

1180
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:16,020
Dr Levin Cac more film Guy,
Amazon Dot Com.

1181
00:53:16,021 --> 00:53:17,280
Amazon.com.
He says,

1182
00:53:17,370 --> 00:53:20,430
how can someone mess up such a great 
documentary film in such a way?

1183
00:53:20,431 --> 00:53:25,431
I hope National Geographic does 
something about it and we can buy it 

1184
00:53:25,431 --> 00:53:25,790
again.
I tried a of different age.

1185
00:53:25,791 --> 00:53:26,080
DVD.

1186
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:26,700
Oh,
okay.

1187
00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:28,710
He's saying,
okay,

1188
00:53:28,711 --> 00:53:30,840
this guy is saying to exit the.
No,

1189
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:34,320
he's saying that the DVD he got it was 
any of the other ones over there,

1190
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,030
but yeah,
it's fucking nuts.

1191
00:53:36,031 --> 00:53:38,340
Fucking amazing.
It's amazing.

1192
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:43,400
Oh,
it's saying we will not play on the 

1193
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,160
video.
The problem with digital media is pretty

1194
00:53:44,161 --> 00:53:47,310
huge right now.
Somebody bashing itunes the other day

1195
00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:50,980
saying that it doesn't play.
Wow.

1196
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:56,040
For two or three are saying these three 
reviews that are on the front page 

1197
00:53:57,070 --> 00:53:58,720
anyway,
the documentary itself,

1198
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:00,730
if these poor guys could get the DVD to 
work,

1199
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:02,680
it's fucking incredible.
I mean,

1200
00:54:02,681 --> 00:54:05,260
it just shows you how quickly life can 
adapt.

1201
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:06,490
You know,
there's these,

1202
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:07,210
uh,
you know,

1203
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:10,650
the Amazon rain forest has only existed.
None of the Amazon.

1204
00:54:10,651 --> 00:54:15,651
It rather.
The Congo has only existed in that form 

1205
00:54:15,651 --> 00:54:19,200
for like a few thousand years and 
thousands of years before that it was 

1206
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:22,831
like grasslands.
So there's animals that are trapped 

1207
00:54:22,831 --> 00:54:25,210
inside the Congo that are animals that 
live on the grass plains,

1208
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:28,630
like rhinos are trapped in there and 
deer and antelope.

1209
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:33,810
And there's one little antelope that has
developed the ability to swim underwater

1210
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:39,360
because the Congo was filled with water,
develop the ability to swim underwater 

1211
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:42,781
up to a hundred yards and it eats fish 
and it's a fucking antelope.

1212
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:43,740
And it's,
yeah,

1213
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:48,750
there's a little short ass legs because 
evolution dictated that this animal 

1214
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:48,970
change.
I mean,

1215
00:54:48,971 --> 00:54:53,971
and that happened over 2000 years.
There's a fish in the Amazon that comes 

1216
00:54:53,971 --> 00:54:56,290
out of the fucking water and walks.
It's awesome.

1217
00:54:56,740 --> 00:55:01,740
It's crazy.
And finds another waterhole and then 

1218
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:03,400
there's this fucking bird that eats it,
that looks like a goddamn dinosaur.

1219
00:55:03,401 --> 00:55:08,401
It's a six foot tall evil giant bird 
with this crazy big ass fucking beak,

1220
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:14,050
like this big killing machine attached 
to its face and it's got these dead eyes

1221
00:55:14,051 --> 00:55:19,051
like these dead crazy dinosaur eagle 
eyes and it jacks this fucking old 

1222
00:55:19,051 --> 00:55:20,830
dinosaur walking fish.
And you're like,

1223
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:23,260
Whoa,
that's a nutty goddamn place.

1224
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:27,010
That's the same planet we live on.
That's the same planet we live on.

1225
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,140
You're saying that old video of like the
Eagle,

1226
00:55:29,141 --> 00:55:32,190
like killing all those goats,
like throwing them off the cliffs.

1227
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:37,700
It's awesome.
It's ego just it's like on top of a 

1228
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:37,990
cliff and there's all these goats and 
it's just like grabbing him and throwing

1229
00:55:37,991 --> 00:55:40,510
him off the cliff and eat them.

1230
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,480
It could barely carry them,
but it's dragging them like.

1231
00:55:43,481 --> 00:55:48,481
It's like you're doing it on purpose.
It couldn't kill them if it was just on 

1232
00:55:48,481 --> 00:55:51,601
flat land.
It knows it's going to kill them by 

1233
00:55:51,601 --> 00:55:51,601
dragging them off the rock.
I mean,

1234
00:55:51,601 --> 00:55:51,601
that's incredible.

1235
00:55:51,601 --> 00:55:53,210
Yeah,
it's smart to man,

1236
00:55:53,230 --> 00:55:57,580
like whatever this blackbirds are where 
they have.

1237
00:55:57,740 --> 00:55:59,690
They use tools.
You've seen that?

1238
00:55:59,691 --> 00:55:59,990
Yeah.

1239
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:01,750
Yeah.
I've,

1240
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:06,760
I've,
I've seen them do all kinds of creepy 

1241
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:06,760
shit.
I had a stake in A.

1242
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:06,930
I was trying to,
um,

1243
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:10,670
um,
a thought out and I put it on.

1244
00:56:10,730 --> 00:56:12,110
It was in the rap,
you know,

1245
00:56:12,111 --> 00:56:17,111
from the supermarket and I put it on a 
stone outside my house for a minute,

1246
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:22,070
maybe a minute.
I came out and these crows worth fucking

1247
00:56:22,071 --> 00:56:23,920
it up.
They've me.

1248
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:29,310
They watched me put that out and then 
they swooped in and look at it and I 

1249
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:29,550
think that is meet this dumb 
motherfucker,

1250
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:32,290
left some meat out.
Like there's no way he's that stupid.

1251
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:34,360
He left some meat out.
I'm telling you it's me.

1252
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:39,390
Let's eat it.
And they landed on and just her fuck it 

1253
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:39,390
up.
And I came out,

1254
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:39,390
there was two of them just fucking up 
the state.

1255
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:41,230
Wow.
They're so clever.

1256
00:56:41,290 --> 00:56:46,290
It's crazy.
And a rat witnessing it now of flying 

1257
00:56:46,290 --> 00:56:46,500
rat.
Even flying like a pigeon.

1258
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:48,400
Pigeon magic.
We're flying rats around here.

1259
00:56:48,401 --> 00:56:50,050
How horrible that would be.
There were pigeons,

1260
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:56,010
pigeons flying rats.
Unless you raise them yourself in the 

1261
00:56:56,010 --> 00:56:56,370
cute.
I'd been putting bird feed out lately at

1262
00:56:56,390 --> 00:57:01,390
my backyard in the bird feed.
I put out a attracts these little 

1263
00:57:01,390 --> 00:57:02,680
canaries now.
Have just little canaries everywhere.

1264
00:57:02,681 --> 00:57:05,270
I've never in Ohio,
they don't have canaries or

1265
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:07,370
fellows.
Very specific.

1266
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:11,150
Have either of you guys tried j dot w,
h o

1267
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:14,700
when I heard about this the other day is
that there's a,

1268
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:17,320
there's a topic on your form about it.
Um,

1269
00:57:18,430 --> 00:57:20,410
I can't remember.
What is this?

1270
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:21,820
Oh my God.
Oh,

1271
00:57:21,821 --> 00:57:23,530
here.
Here's how crazy you internet kids.

1272
00:57:23,531 --> 00:57:25,390
Are you coming up with new ways to get 
high?

1273
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:29,980
It's an analgesic chemical from the 
Amino alkalol,

1274
00:57:30,070 --> 00:57:33,190
alcohol and node.
How do you say that?

1275
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:37,510
And I don't know.
Yeah,

1276
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:43,390
no,
I'll key lineal family at which acts as 

1277
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:46,080
a cannabinoid,
blah,

1278
00:57:46,081 --> 00:57:46,420
blah,
blah,

1279
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:46,900
blah,
blah.

1280
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:52,230
Well,
it must be something that gets you 

1281
00:57:52,230 --> 00:57:54,121
fucked up.
I'm sure there's a lot of those things 

1282
00:57:54,121 --> 00:57:54,310
to a different new things.
You know,

1283
00:57:54,311 --> 00:57:59,311
this sounds crazy coming from someone 
who's done as many soccer dogs as I 

1284
00:57:59,311 --> 00:58:02,641
have,
but I think the shit that you should do 

1285
00:58:02,641 --> 00:58:02,641
is the shift that people have been doing
for thousands of years.

1286
00:58:02,641 --> 00:58:05,200
You know,
you can't go wrong with San Pedro.

1287
00:58:05,201 --> 00:58:07,060
Cactus,
you can't go wrong with cannabis.

1288
00:58:07,061 --> 00:58:08,740
Mushrooms.
You can't go wrong with those things.

1289
00:58:08,830 --> 00:58:10,180
IOWASCA.
You can't go wrong.

1290
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:11,110
I mean,
you can't go wrong.

1291
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:13,450
You lose your fucking marbles.
Don't listen to me.

1292
00:58:13,630 --> 00:58:17,200
What I'm saying is you knew stuff like,
you know,

1293
00:58:17,201 --> 00:58:18,420
hey man,
try this new shit.

1294
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:20,540
Scientists fucking in NASA labs,
man.

1295
00:58:20,550 --> 00:58:22,540
It just came up with it.
Um,

1296
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:24,870
no,
don't,

1297
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:27,400
don't do anything that people haven't 
been doing a long time.

1298
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:33,120
Don't fuck with some new shit.
They just invented tests and you smoke 

1299
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:34,210
it and it makes you want to fuck 
animals.

1300
00:58:34,211 --> 00:58:35,800
You know,
who the hell knows?

1301
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:37,330
All the old Indians.
They were,

1302
00:58:37,331 --> 00:58:38,470
have their Beta testers.

1303
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:43,600
That was their shit.
The San Pedro cactus masculine.

1304
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:48,690
I've never done that.
If you ever done it was just crazy that 

1305
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:49,840
these things are illegal.
I mean,

1306
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:55,200
Bill Hicks had a great line about that.
Like isn't there something fucked up 

1307
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,490
about making nature against the law?
You know,

1308
00:58:57,550 --> 00:58:59,050
it was just totally,
totally true.

1309
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:04,710
I mean,
how could you tell someone that they 

1310
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:04,710
can't have a life form that exists 
naturally on this planet,

1311
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:07,820
whether it's cannabis or mushrooms or 
you know,

1312
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:10,030
anything,
anything that grows naturally,

1313
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:15,150
you can buy this and Sonya,
anything that's affects your 

1314
00:59:15,150 --> 00:59:15,580
consciousness.
You can buy stuff that's poisonous,

1315
00:59:15,581 --> 00:59:19,960
like you can legally have a bunch of 
different plants that can kill you,

1316
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:23,360
a bunch of different plants.
You know,

1317
00:59:23,361 --> 00:59:28,361
it's like you just having marijuana in 
your backyard is not proof that you're 

1318
00:59:28,361 --> 00:59:31,991
eating marijuana or using it and if you 
have all these poisonous plants in your 

1319
00:59:31,991 --> 00:59:32,960
backyard,
nobody would even bat an eye.

1320
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:34,100
And that's the same thing.
It's not.

1321
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:36,880
I mean it's a personal use issue.
You know,

1322
00:59:36,881 --> 00:59:41,881
it's,
it's really so weird that people allow 

1323
00:59:41,881 --> 00:59:42,260
in this day and age with all the 
information that we have,

1324
00:59:42,410 --> 00:59:44,420
allow plants to be illegal.
Man,

1325
00:59:44,421 --> 00:59:47,540
it's fucking pretty incredible ants.
It's pretty incredible.

1326
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:50,360
It's fucking really bizarre that we 
have.

1327
00:59:50,990 --> 00:59:55,990
We enforce it so strictly.
It's such a strong ethic in our culture 

1328
00:59:55,990 --> 00:59:59,501
that if we catch you using certain 
plants that have nothing to do with me,

1329
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:01,520
they're not effective.
Not at all.

1330
01:00:01,521 --> 01:00:06,521
But if I catch you with these plants,
I'm allowed by our laws to q and a cage.

1331
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:14,150
How crazy is that?
If you haven't yet giant ass bag of 

1332
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:17,431
mushrooms and you are driving on your 
way to the woods and a cop pulls you 

1333
01:00:17,621 --> 01:00:18,880
over and says,
what are you doing?

1334
01:00:19,090 --> 01:00:19,420
He's like,
well,

1335
01:00:19,421 --> 01:00:21,460
I'm about to have a spiritual experience
with the Lord.

1336
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:23,200
The Capa go,
what the fuck you're talking about?

1337
01:00:23,230 --> 01:00:24,940
Well,
I have these mushrooms that I'm going to

1338
01:00:24,941 --> 01:00:27,520
go out to get the fuck out of the car.
Get out of the car,

1339
01:00:27,830 --> 01:00:29,920
he'll handcuff you.
Fucking idiot.

1340
01:00:29,921 --> 01:00:31,300
You're telling me about this.
I'm just letting you know,

1341
01:00:31,301 --> 01:00:33,560
man.
I'm just a nature is natural.

1342
01:00:33,561 --> 01:00:35,680
It grows on the earth and it's shut the 
fuck up.

1343
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:40,740
Shut up.
I don't want to hear I wanna hear your 

1344
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:40,740
hippie bullshit.
Get in the fucking car.

1345
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:41,710
I just hit the mother with this stupid 
fuck.

1346
01:00:41,830 --> 01:00:43,770
This guy told me he had mushrooms on 
him.

1347
01:00:43,790 --> 01:00:46,780
How high is he?
No wonder you.

1348
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:52,160
Let's go to salaries and then they meet 
up and they feel good for locking this 

1349
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:52,910
guy in a cage for having plants on them.
Yeah,

1350
01:00:53,010 --> 01:00:55,720
that's bizarre.
Two thousand 10.

1351
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:58,970
That's strange.
I mean it's.

1352
01:00:58,990 --> 01:01:00,730
It's very hard to believe if that's the 
case.

1353
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:02,210
What's.
It's really strange.

1354
01:01:02,211 --> 01:01:05,110
That 2010 is that we're going towards 
2020.

1355
01:01:05,390 --> 01:01:08,340
That's just craziness.
It was crazy.

1356
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:14,400
Just the sound of it.
This guy says it's because of money 

1357
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:14,400
though.
Yeah.

1358
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:14,530
It's definitely because of money,
but it's just,

1359
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:16,390
it's amazing.
You know.

1360
01:01:16,391 --> 01:01:19,090
Here's the best example of how it's for 
sure.

1361
01:01:19,091 --> 01:01:21,370
Politicians are whores.
Best example,

1362
01:01:21,550 --> 01:01:23,830
nobody talks about cigarettes.
If cigarettes was,

1363
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:27,550
if al Qaeda was killing 400,000
people in America every year,

1364
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:30,010
Holy Shit.
With the war against al Qaeda heat up,

1365
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:34,090
it will be gigantic as it is there.
They're killing people.

1366
01:01:34,150 --> 01:01:36,160
Most of them that they've killed,
you know,

1367
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:39,730
unless she lifts the Alex Jones 
government.

1368
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:42,460
But most of them are in other countries.
I mean,

1369
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:47,490
in this country alone,
I'll Kinda is not aware of Jack and 

1370
01:01:47,490 --> 01:01:47,490
people,
but cigarettes are cigarettes.

1371
01:01:47,490 --> 01:01:48,280
She'll 400 fucking thousand people a 
year.

1372
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:53,520
I mean,
compare something you use for personal 

1373
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:53,520
use to al Qaeda is ridiculous.

1374
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:58,020
Absolutely,
but my point is like it's very 

1375
01:01:58,020 --> 01:01:58,320
dangerous.
Marijuana doesn't do that.

1376
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:03,750
Even alcoholism killed that.
Many people think about how fucked up 

1377
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:05,200
alcohol gets you and alcohol poisoning 
or alcohol deaths.

1378
01:02:05,290 --> 01:02:09,490
It's not nearly as high as cigarettes.
Cigarettes is a motherfucker and it's so

1379
01:02:09,491 --> 01:02:10,860
hard to kick.
Right?

1380
01:02:11,150 --> 01:02:12,400
You went back on him,
right?

1381
01:02:12,401 --> 01:02:14,960
Yeah.
Brian terms.

1382
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:16,750
That was a year.
He's done it a couple times in.

1383
01:02:16,751 --> 01:02:19,380
One little thing will set that trigger 
off in the back of head.

1384
01:02:19,381 --> 01:02:22,410
It's mostly stress stuff.
It's horrible,

1385
01:02:22,411 --> 01:02:27,411
but meanwhile it's totally legal.
And did we talk about the oxycontin 

1386
01:02:27,411 --> 01:02:27,411
express last week?
We did,

1387
01:02:27,411 --> 01:02:28,330
right?
God,

1388
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:30,540
we talked about cigarettes too.
We talked to.

1389
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:35,630
These are important issues.
If you haven't seen the oxygen come 

1390
01:02:35,630 --> 01:02:35,630
express,
get on that shit.

1391
01:02:35,630 --> 01:02:36,570
Find it on,
on online.

1392
01:02:36,571 --> 01:02:37,950
I think it's on youtube.
The whole thing is,

1393
01:02:37,951 --> 01:02:40,890
and it's one of those directors version,
so that whole things on youtube.

1394
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:43,830
So this week.
And you're at the Ice House?

1395
01:02:43,831 --> 01:02:44,340
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

1396
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:45,960
Yeah.
We're doing comedy this weekend.

1397
01:02:45,990 --> 01:02:50,990
Bitches making it happen.
He's going to be a job at the Ice House 

1398
01:02:50,990 --> 01:02:51,870
in Pasadena.
Uh,

1399
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:55,410
this Friday we're doing two shows there 
and Saturday we're doing two shows.

1400
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:58,590
This guy says dmt is not easy to 
extract.

1401
01:02:58,890 --> 01:03:01,230
Well,
you ain't no super secret scientist.

1402
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:01,620
Are you?

1403
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:10,220
Do you ever smoke banana plc?
These motherfuckers?

1404
01:03:12,510 --> 01:03:14,440
Yeah.
I smoked a lot of shit when I was young.

1405
01:03:14,870 --> 01:03:16,100
Stupid.
I was trying to get high.

1406
01:03:16,101 --> 01:03:18,250
I smoked like bamboo leaves.
It was horrible.

1407
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:19,450
Very harsh on the lungs too.

1408
01:03:24,290 --> 01:03:26,240
Birds can be scary.
They are on acid.

1409
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:28,280
Oh yeah.
Good point.

1410
01:03:28,310 --> 01:03:31,370
Amazing Kush.
The bird can be super scary.

1411
01:03:31,371 --> 01:03:32,060
Period,
man.

1412
01:03:32,061 --> 01:03:37,061
You were looking at Eagle's eye like you
ever seen a dude that has like a pet 

1413
01:03:37,061 --> 01:03:40,181
eagle.
We've those talk shows and they get 

1414
01:03:40,181 --> 01:03:40,181
close up on an eagles.
Hi,

1415
01:03:40,181 --> 01:03:43,810
this girl,
I just got an owl as a pen and have you 

1416
01:03:43,810 --> 01:03:44,330
seen him as a murderer?
Murderer.

1417
01:03:44,331 --> 01:03:47,080
And it just sits in their back room on 
that.

1418
01:03:47,081 --> 01:03:49,700
The shower thing y'all.
That ain't cool.

1419
01:03:50,030 --> 01:03:51,620
That's a predator.
It's crazy.

1420
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:56,680
That's a real like animals look all 
fluffy and cool and everything because 

1421
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:57,370
everybody thinks about them from those 
Goddamn tootsie roll commercials,

1422
01:03:57,740 --> 01:03:59,570
tootsie pops.
That's not.

1423
01:03:59,571 --> 01:04:04,571
No,
that's a fucking Predator thing about 

1424
01:04:04,571 --> 01:04:07,790
people where we take these evil 
predators and we change what they are.

1425
01:04:08,060 --> 01:04:11,570
Like polar bears.
We got them selling ice cream.

1426
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:16,920
Nicola polar bears are fucking monsters.
Polar bears cover their nose when 

1427
01:04:17,781 --> 01:04:21,470
they're sneaking up on Eskimo villages 
so that they can't see the black.

1428
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:23,420
That's awesome.
Do they?

1429
01:04:23,430 --> 01:04:24,680
They.
They learned how to do that.

1430
01:04:24,681 --> 01:04:27,310
Hunting seals.
They take their nose and they.

1431
01:04:27,311 --> 01:04:32,090
They hang over the edge of a glacier,
a floating ice raft,

1432
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:36,320
and they hang over the edge so that 
these seals don't see them.

1433
01:04:36,321 --> 01:04:37,850
They see white.
Everything is white.

1434
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:43,000
If they see that black nose,
they figured out that seals can see the 

1435
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:43,310
black nose.
That's how fucking evil they are,

1436
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:46,260
and we got them selling ice cream and 
coca cola,

1437
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:49,250
tony the tiger.
That's about chimps,

1438
01:04:49,251 --> 01:04:50,520
man.
Bj and the bear.

1439
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:52,820
This tooling around with a little pet 
monkey.

1440
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:55,400
How can Bj and the bear?
How come behr number eight,

1441
01:04:55,401 --> 01:04:56,950
anybody's face off.
How come Behr?

1442
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:59,570
Never tried to bite some dude's asshole 
out by thinking.

1443
01:04:59,610 --> 01:05:02,620
I think that that monkey ended up doing 
that with net.

1444
01:05:02,630 --> 01:05:05,240
The monkey that was retired here in Los 
Angeles.

1445
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:07,250
They,
they always retirement,

1446
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:09,200
they get older because you can't control
the old males.

1447
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:13,130
You can't control them,
aren't mirrors to ancestors are.

1448
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:16,550
It doesn't matter if you raise them.
They're completely wild.

1449
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:21,700
You cannot stop that.
That lady just thought just because she 

1450
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:22,000
was putting a diaper on this champ,
you know,

1451
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:25,210
and given Xanax and she would give it 
wine and shit.

1452
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:30,250
It was like a fake boyfriend.
She had like this fake monkey boyfriend 

1453
01:05:30,250 --> 01:05:30,280
and she thought she had the thing under 
control.

1454
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:32,380
Then they just decided eat either 
friend's face.

1455
01:05:32,530 --> 01:05:34,090
It's like,
I don't fucking like you.

1456
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:35,590
I don't like you.
He didn't.

1457
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:38,800
I mean there was no fight.
There weren't brawling.

1458
01:05:38,830 --> 01:05:40,800
She didn't hit him with a rock.
He shouldn't.

1459
01:05:40,850 --> 01:05:44,400
Shit is attacked her an eight or face.
Whoa.

1460
01:05:45,380 --> 01:05:47,760
Even dogs don't usually do that.
You know,

1461
01:05:47,770 --> 01:05:50,680
you got a guy who's got a crazy dog.
They don't attack your friends.

1462
01:05:51,050 --> 01:05:53,260
How often does that happen?
I say kids.

1463
01:05:53,590 --> 01:05:55,510
Yeah,
because they think kids are animals.

1464
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:56,410
They don't respect them.

1465
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:01,970
That all that shit about my cat really 
freaks me out.

1466
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:06,710
Talking Shit about him.
I can't kill anything.

1467
01:06:06,711 --> 01:06:09,200
You know,
if you have a pet monkey,

1468
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:12,120
a little monkey like that big,
would you be safe leaving room?

1469
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:14,910
This fluffy cat shouldn't murder that 
thing.

1470
01:06:15,450 --> 01:06:17,780
I come home,
it's got to be all hanging out and she'd

1471
01:06:17,781 --> 01:06:19,580
be looking at me like she's my friend.
Hi.

1472
01:06:19,870 --> 01:06:21,260
They will not even like,
she's evil.

1473
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:23,930
Poor little monkey was little monkey 
family.

1474
01:06:23,931 --> 01:06:26,570
She'd kill them to the little monkey.
Babies are merciless.

1475
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:30,830
It should be rolling around the dead 
bodies.

1476
01:06:31,130 --> 01:06:34,130
Especially with her,
cause she's got real close.

1477
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:36,770
She's not declawed.
He's declawed.

1478
01:06:37,190 --> 01:06:39,830
They all have these things I just found.
I don't know if I told you this or not,

1479
01:06:40,150 --> 01:06:45,150
where they go over the claw used glue,
any put glue in these little claws and 

1480
01:06:45,150 --> 01:06:46,990
it goes over the claw.
So they think they have closed still,

1481
01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:49,880
but it's weird rabbit with him,
but after awhile they pop off,

1482
01:06:49,910 --> 01:06:52,300
they pop off and pop off.
Quick Park,

1483
01:06:52,390 --> 01:06:55,610
keep choosing off to late Jack and 
everything sucks.

1484
01:06:55,670 --> 01:06:57,740
Yeah,
I wouldn't let him keep his claws.

1485
01:06:57,741 --> 01:06:58,790
I don't care.
I think it's.

1486
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:02,240
I think it's fucked up to take the 
youtube video.

1487
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:04,790
They actually cut off a knuckle.
It cut off this part.

1488
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:10,720
That's craziness.
My cat killed a rabbit when it was a 

1489
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:11,340
kitten.
Damn,

1490
01:07:13,610 --> 01:07:14,280
that's a.

1491
01:07:14,410 --> 01:07:15,970
that's a rough story.
Asian alien.

1492
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:17,950
I believe it though.
Cats are ruthless.

1493
01:07:23,670 --> 01:07:28,440
I grew up in a knot who'd wear a cro,
could talk.

1494
01:07:28,441 --> 01:07:31,260
His name was car and he would come when 
called.

1495
01:07:31,710 --> 01:07:32,280
Wow.

1496
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:37,520
You know what if I had never read 
anything about crows or watched a video 

1497
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:37,830
and I'd be like,
that guy's crazy.

1498
01:07:37,930 --> 01:07:40,800
Crows coming to pet crow.
Totally the same.

1499
01:07:41,030 --> 01:07:42,770
It's not like they're all black.
Right.

1500
01:07:42,790 --> 01:07:44,580
You know when they figured out you have 
food,

1501
01:07:44,610 --> 01:07:49,610
you know.
I find it weird when people have no 

1502
01:07:49,610 --> 01:07:51,300
worlds as pets or raccoons.
Raccoons are crazy to see that one video

1503
01:07:51,301 --> 01:07:56,301
where a raccoon or a dog or wrestling,
they usually fighting to the death and 

1504
01:07:56,301 --> 01:07:56,910
now you know raccoons.
Fuck dogs up,

1505
01:07:56,911 --> 01:07:58,050
man.
They've ripped them apart.

1506
01:07:58,080 --> 01:07:59,490
Yeah,
they're scary animals.

1507
01:07:59,650 --> 01:08:04,650
I mean,
I see him all the time or in my 

1508
01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:04,650
neighborhood.

1509
01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:08,780
Raccoons and skunks and rats books.
We lost to history that I would have 

1510
01:08:10,141 --> 01:08:12,930
changed the world.
That's long articles that good.

1511
01:08:16,970 --> 01:08:17,600
I'll check it out.

1512
01:08:18,950 --> 01:08:20,590
All right.
We're going to read some questions here.

1513
01:08:20,710 --> 01:08:21,850
One year.
No cigarettes.

1514
01:08:21,851 --> 01:08:24,610
This guy says all it cost me was a 
girlfriend.

1515
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:25,840
The dog.
She took my,

1516
01:08:25,930 --> 01:08:28,660
my waistline and my sanity.
Wow.

1517
01:08:29,150 --> 01:08:30,630
And you get hit by a bus tomorrow.

1518
01:08:32,270 --> 01:08:37,270
Deserved the cigarettes after she left 
you or you couldn't afford them after 

1519
01:08:37,270 --> 01:08:39,390
she left you or you quit the cigarettes 
and because you couldn't cigarettes.

1520
01:08:39,391 --> 01:08:43,340
You went crazy and you were like aggro.
And then she left you.

1521
01:08:43,610 --> 01:08:45,530
Is that what you're saying?
That she took the dog.

1522
01:08:47,110 --> 01:08:48,620
It's took your waistline,
but the wasteland.

1523
01:08:48,621 --> 01:08:49,190
That's good.
Right?

1524
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:50,480
You want to lose,
lose some weight?

1525
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:55,630
Probably.
Unless you like one of those dudes in 

1526
01:08:55,630 --> 01:08:55,630
the guts.
Apparently there's a lot of gay dudes to

1527
01:08:55,630 --> 01:08:57,590
them.
Electronic guts like that.

1528
01:08:57,770 --> 01:09:00,590
They'd like to have a clicker.
They gotten cock.

1529
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:03,130
I think like those ladies,
Zack.

1530
01:09:03,131 --> 01:09:03,920
Zack got some,

1531
01:09:04,990 --> 01:09:09,990
you know,
I mean there's fetishes just like some 

1532
01:09:09,990 --> 01:09:12,121
dudes are like really in a feet.
Some dudes are really into like girls 

1533
01:09:12,121 --> 01:09:13,060
and spiff specific type of toenails and 
like come on girls toes,

1534
01:09:13,390 --> 01:09:15,430
you know,
I think with gay dudes and just get into

1535
01:09:15,431 --> 01:09:20,431
a certain thing like they see some crazy
homophobic trucker is all mapped out at 

1536
01:09:20,861 --> 01:09:25,861
the truck stop and they just wish they 
could just suck his cock because he 

1537
01:09:25,861 --> 01:09:26,270
hates them.
He hates them.

1538
01:09:26,271 --> 01:09:28,630
There's something about them.
It just turns the gay guy on.

1539
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:31,730
That's my theory.
That's fine.

1540
01:09:31,770 --> 01:09:33,910
That guy with this big fat gut and suck 
that Dick.

1541
01:09:33,970 --> 01:09:34,480
What?

1542
01:09:34,830 --> 01:09:36,750
I love people like this.
Somebody just asked,

1543
01:09:36,751 --> 01:09:41,751
you know what?
They've been trying to see your tattoo 

1544
01:09:41,751 --> 01:09:41,751
for three weeks.
They've been asking now,

1545
01:09:41,751 --> 01:09:44,640
wouldn't you think you can see that when
this person does google,

1546
01:09:44,670 --> 01:09:49,050
if he really cared that much.
Joe Rogan Tattoo at the.

1547
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:50,780
That's the kind of people I hate.
You know?

1548
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:52,080
It's like,
well,

1549
01:09:52,081 --> 01:09:53,580
I don't hate,
but I hate people.

1550
01:09:53,581 --> 01:09:55,590
When they asked me all these questions,
I'm like,

1551
01:09:55,591 --> 01:09:57,210
man,
if you're fucking google broken.

1552
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:58,620
That shit happens to me all the time.
Yeah.

1553
01:09:58,670 --> 01:10:00,170
People,
there's some people that just don't have

1554
01:10:00,171 --> 01:10:01,540
good friends.
Good.

1555
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:03,320
Talked to lazy fingers.

1556
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:06,710
No.

1557
01:10:09,590 --> 01:10:12,070
Yeah.
The only problem with marijuana,

1558
01:10:12,071 --> 01:10:17,071
there is one problem with marijuana and 
it's some of the marijuana community.

1559
01:10:18,370 --> 01:10:22,090
A lot of churches,
you know,

1560
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:28,160
a lot of mooches and dirty hippies.
Brian left this insist,

1561
01:10:29,270 --> 01:10:31,360
you and me now.
Do you think I should get rid of him?

1562
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:36,340
So I kick him out of the room and just 
have it all about us.

1563
01:10:37,390 --> 01:10:38,020
Say,
listen man,

1564
01:10:38,021 --> 01:10:40,990
you did your part today.
That's been my people.

1565
01:10:54,010 --> 01:10:55,030
Yeah.
This dude is saying,

1566
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:57,430
um,
I did a job.

1567
01:10:57,431 --> 01:11:02,431
Ct Dirt says I did a job and these 
people fed wild raccoons and they 

1568
01:11:02,431 --> 01:11:03,650
scratch at the door like a cat.
Wow.

1569
01:11:03,730 --> 01:11:06,130
That's crazy.
That's nuts,

1570
01:11:06,131 --> 01:11:07,240
man.
Makes Sense.

1571
01:11:07,241 --> 01:11:10,780
I've seen squirrels that you could feed.
There's a park in north Hollywood and if

1572
01:11:10,781 --> 01:11:12,580
you break peanuts of you,
especially,

1573
01:11:12,581 --> 01:11:17,581
you lie down.
So the squirrel doesn't feel like you 

1574
01:11:17,581 --> 01:11:19,490
know,
you're in a threatening position to 

1575
01:11:19,490 --> 01:11:19,490
chase after him.
You know,

1576
01:11:19,490 --> 01:11:20,170
you lie down on your stomach and you 
hold up in the fucking scroll.

1577
01:11:20,171 --> 01:11:25,171
Come up to you real gingerly,
making sure you're not crazy and he'll 

1578
01:11:25,171 --> 01:11:25,530
take that peanut and some dudes that the
squirrels.

1579
01:11:25,531 --> 01:11:30,531
No really well though to sit right in 
front of the dude and eat his peanuts 

1580
01:11:30,531 --> 01:11:30,720
like right there.
Like this one,

1581
01:11:30,721 --> 01:11:33,870
there was this one old Chinese guy that 
apparently goes to the park everyday and

1582
01:11:33,871 --> 01:11:37,680
he brings penis and so he's sitting 
there with these peanuts.

1583
01:11:37,681 --> 01:11:42,681
These girls are coming right up to him.
They're just holding his hand while 

1584
01:11:42,681 --> 01:11:42,681
they're taking the peanut.
Like he's their friend.

1585
01:11:42,681 --> 01:11:43,830
Like they're not worried about him at 
all.

1586
01:11:43,831 --> 01:11:45,880
It's kind of crazy,
crazy saying.

1587
01:11:46,630 --> 01:11:51,630
By the way,
the Jedis is that new digital camera I 

1588
01:11:51,630 --> 01:11:51,630
reviewed.
If you guys are

1589
01:11:51,630 --> 01:11:56,190
helium to say this before,
if you ever want to like buy something 

1590
01:11:56,190 --> 01:11:56,720
like in in he know that he's reviewed 
it.

1591
01:11:56,721 --> 01:11:59,120
You got to watch his reviews.
He's crazy.

1592
01:11:59,121 --> 01:12:04,121
There's something wrong with him and he 
gets like super into the technical 

1593
01:12:04,121 --> 01:12:07,871
aspects of anything.
Technology like phones and like his 

1594
01:12:07,871 --> 01:12:09,370
reviews of phones.
He kills those guys at engadget.

1595
01:12:09,830 --> 01:12:11,810
Those bitches.
You can't hang with Brian.

1596
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:14,280
The problem is a lot of these websites 
are getting money,

1597
01:12:14,510 --> 01:12:19,510
you know,
they're getting like they're going to 

1598
01:12:19,510 --> 01:12:19,510
get.
Well,

1599
01:12:19,510 --> 01:12:19,510
not saying that engadget does.
No,

1600
01:12:19,510 --> 01:12:19,510
no,
no,

1601
01:12:19,510 --> 01:12:22,290
but like if they've reviewed favorably,
say like an apple product,

1602
01:12:22,310 --> 01:12:23,850
then the next time apple has a product 
out,

1603
01:12:23,851 --> 01:12:25,990
they'll give them like an exclusive.
Because you know,

1604
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:28,440
a lot of these websites don't want to 
bash her,

1605
01:12:28,441 --> 01:12:33,441
tell the truth because they don't want 
to ruin future products and stuff like 

1606
01:12:33,441 --> 01:12:33,441
that.
So anyways,

1607
01:12:33,441 --> 01:12:35,760
this is a new camera in world works is a
new camera.

1608
01:12:35,761 --> 01:12:38,760
Films Hd.
It's high quality hd,

1609
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:43,820
60 frames per second.
I have the whole review at red band 

1610
01:12:43,820 --> 01:12:46,710
Dotcom Stereo microphones.
If you're looking for a small digital 

1611
01:12:46,710 --> 01:12:46,710
video camera,
this shit.

1612
01:12:46,710 --> 01:12:47,580
What's the model name?
Brian?

1613
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:52,600
It's Sony DSC t x seven and red band.
Red Bin Dot com.

1614
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:54,960
I have the whole review there.

1615
01:12:55,140 --> 01:12:58,920
This dude says,
podcast or a girl says podcasts from the

1616
01:12:58,921 --> 01:13:03,921
sensory deprivation tank.
Maybe that would be a fucking cool thing

1617
01:13:04,471 --> 01:13:05,380
to do.
You know what?

1618
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:08,040
Actually it sounds like that.
Would it be?

1619
01:13:08,070 --> 01:13:09,660
Would it sound like that?
It was.

1620
01:13:09,661 --> 01:13:12,690
Is there a way that I could have 
somebody recording sound in there?

1621
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:15,900
Well,
you know,

1622
01:13:16,070 --> 01:13:19,490
he can't get away and then we can hook 
them.

1623
01:13:19,491 --> 01:13:21,510
Might put a microphone right at two next
to it.

1624
01:13:21,511 --> 01:13:25,650
But I mean there was some more both,
you know and all that stuff because it's

1625
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:26,780
echoing in there.
Yeah.

1626
01:13:26,910 --> 01:13:27,810
But who wants to do.
Why?

1627
01:13:27,830 --> 01:13:28,260
Why?
Oh,

1628
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,250
you mean just lay there and talk?
Yeah.

1629
01:13:31,370 --> 01:13:33,280
Well we could just turn off the lights 
here and you can talk and.

1630
01:13:35,690 --> 01:13:36,230
No,
no.

1631
01:13:36,231 --> 01:13:37,760
I'm going to totally do that.
Winning,

1632
01:13:37,761 --> 01:13:41,060
that defeat the purpose of being in 
isolation tank.

1633
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:41,810
No.
Okay.

1634
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:43,700
You will be too focused on talking to 
people.

1635
01:13:44,060 --> 01:13:44,470
No,
no,

1636
01:13:44,471 --> 01:13:47,770
because it would be talking to people.
Your mind would work so much better than

1637
01:13:47,771 --> 01:13:52,771
it works with sitting in a normal 
environment like here talking to you and

1638
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:57,010
sitting on a couch and lights and the 
laptop and all this input coming in.

1639
01:13:57,250 --> 01:14:02,250
You don't realize how much this has an 
effect on your ability to see things 

1640
01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:06,031
clearly and you see things very,
very clear in that tank and I think if 

1641
01:14:06,031 --> 01:14:06,640
you're in that tank and you just start 
talking,

1642
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:12,100
it's going to fuck up a little bit of 
the experience because you're going to 

1643
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:13,040
hear things.
You hear yourself in both in your ears,

1644
01:14:13,041 --> 01:14:14,140
so hear to your ears.
Can you hear it?

1645
01:14:14,141 --> 01:14:14,250
Okay?

1646
01:14:14,330 --> 01:14:18,480
Had you've lost your mind,
but I think it'd be kind of cool.

1647
01:14:19,090 --> 01:14:24,090
I will do that.
We're going to figure out a way where I 

1648
01:14:24,090 --> 01:14:24,090
can do a podcast

1649
01:14:24,090 --> 01:14:27,570
someday from the sensory deprivation 
tank and by Sunday I mean like within a 

1650
01:14:27,570 --> 01:14:29,590
month.
I don't mean like when I'm old and ready

1651
01:14:29,591 --> 01:14:30,010
to die.

1652
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:35,140
Hey,
gay ban the original question three 

1653
01:14:35,140 --> 01:14:37,151
weeks,
two weeks ago was why does joe always 

1654
01:14:37,151 --> 01:14:39,161
wear long sleeve will hae a retard go 
google that because I bet you joe's 

1655
01:14:39,571 --> 01:14:40,220
answer that

1656
01:14:42,210 --> 01:14:42,510
wow.

1657
01:14:44,410 --> 01:14:45,070
Totally out.

1658
01:14:45,450 --> 01:14:46,950
That was really.
It was unnecessary.

1659
01:14:47,740 --> 01:14:49,510
He called me gay man.
I'm allowed to say something.

1660
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:52,810
Wow,
you're an asshole.

1661
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:57,840
But he's looking.
I can't take them seriously because he 

1662
01:14:57,840 --> 01:14:57,840
says Brian is a f,
k,

1663
01:14:57,840 --> 01:14:58,600
k,
a whole.

1664
01:14:58,601 --> 01:14:59,770
If you asked me,

1665
01:15:00,450 --> 01:15:05,450
well,
I'll never going to ask you anything if 

1666
01:15:05,450 --> 01:15:06,980
that's what you write and fkk.
That's really you.

1667
01:15:07,550 --> 01:15:08,720
I can't talk to you dude.

1668
01:15:10,030 --> 01:15:11,550
Brian's the third wheel.
How?

1669
01:15:11,710 --> 01:15:13,810
How dare you?
Ryan's very talented

1670
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:15,970
ipns.
Too much negative energy.

1671
01:15:16,190 --> 01:15:18,810
I think it doesn't have a negative 
negative energies.

1672
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:23,640
The safest,
most non-dangerous negative energy ever.

1673
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:25,020
He's a nice guy.
Leave him alone.

1674
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:28,600
You fucking creeps.
Why won't Dana let you show your town,

1675
01:15:28,610 --> 01:15:29,170
the UFC?
No,

1676
01:15:29,180 --> 01:15:31,230
it's not that.
It's just,

1677
01:15:31,231 --> 01:15:33,150
it's a distraction.
It's not necessary.

1678
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:35,410
You know,
it's not about me when I'm on the UFC,

1679
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:37,740
it's 100 percent about those dudes that 
are fighting.

1680
01:15:37,741 --> 01:15:42,741
I just try to do my part,
my commentary and explain and be 

1681
01:15:42,741 --> 01:15:45,000
enthusiastic and be appreciative,
but it's not about me,

1682
01:15:45,020 --> 01:15:48,300
you know?
That's why I dress like such a retard.

1683
01:15:48,570 --> 01:15:50,190
I'm not trying to shy away

1684
01:15:51,620 --> 01:15:54,300
looking at my cuff links,
looking at diamonds,

1685
01:15:54,820 --> 01:15:58,240
trying to look good at all.
I just try to just do my job.

1686
01:15:58,930 --> 01:16:01,630
What's important is not me.
What's important is these,

1687
01:16:01,631 --> 01:16:06,631
uh,
these guys fucking throwing their bones 

1688
01:16:06,631 --> 01:16:06,631
at each other in the octagon.
It's not me.

1689
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:10,900
What kind of we did we smoke before the 
show?

1690
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:11,730
Well,
Mr.

1691
01:16:11,830 --> 01:16:14,200
federal agent.
That's one of the funniest things that I

1692
01:16:14,201 --> 01:16:17,380
like when someone will ask a stupid 
question and someone will go like,

1693
01:16:17,381 --> 01:16:22,381
laziest homo ever laziest pedo ever 
lasers.

1694
01:16:22,511 --> 01:16:23,770
Dea Age.
Never.

1695
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:26,170
And it's become like a standard was 
like,

1696
01:16:26,171 --> 01:16:27,670
I don't know who was the first one to do
it,

1697
01:16:27,671 --> 01:16:31,360
but I've seen it many forums.
I don't know where it started from,

1698
01:16:31,780 --> 01:16:36,780
but so many people do that now.
Someone will ask a dumb question and 

1699
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:36,780
someone will China,
you know,

1700
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:38,860
China with that.
I think it's really funny,

1701
01:16:38,861 --> 01:16:41,140
like whenever people ask like drug 
questions,

1702
01:16:41,141 --> 01:16:42,690
like,
hey man from Tallahassee,

1703
01:16:42,691 --> 01:16:44,410
where can I get dmt?
And some of them,

1704
01:16:44,411 --> 01:16:46,160
right?
Laziest dea agent.

1705
01:16:47,710 --> 01:16:50,080
It's become a part of it.
Would you say that's the lexicon?

1706
01:16:50,081 --> 01:16:51,590
How would you say to them?

1707
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:52,750
Yeah.

1708
01:16:56,460 --> 01:16:57,040
What else?
Brian?

1709
01:16:57,100 --> 01:16:57,810
Me.
Your questions,

1710
01:16:58,400 --> 01:16:59,150
uh,

1711
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:05,040
kind of weed.
You smoke before a show man,

1712
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:07,440
you wouldn't smoke.
Kind of weedy.

1713
01:17:07,690 --> 01:17:10,070
The kind of comes from.
That's

1714
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:15,070
a funny thing that was talking about 
marijuana supporting these Mexican drug 

1715
01:17:15,070 --> 01:17:15,070
cartels.
What are you talking about,

1716
01:17:15,070 --> 01:17:17,060
Steve?
But the part that I buy,

1717
01:17:17,061 --> 01:17:19,540
I bought this guys growing right over 
there.

1718
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:23,050
You can go to his house.
I'll show you the fuck he talking about.

1719
01:17:23,051 --> 01:17:25,600
He's not al Qaeda and he's not a Mexican
drug lord.

1720
01:17:25,970 --> 01:17:28,720
And he's right down the street.
He's a nice guy and he's got plants.

1721
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:34,000
He'll sell you water zone.
We put fertilizer and she does a great 

1722
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:34,000
job.

1723
01:17:34,330 --> 01:17:35,750
The fuck man.
And it's great.

1724
01:17:35,751 --> 01:17:39,110
There's a website called web 
tracker.com.

1725
01:17:39,111 --> 01:17:43,230
We met this guys in San Francisco,
but each store has a uh,

1726
01:17:43,750 --> 01:17:45,990
own forum and so like,
uh,

1727
01:17:46,020 --> 01:17:48,880
you find which stores near Your House 
and then you go to.

1728
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:54,100
This has like a little website just for 
that store and everyday they'll say 

1729
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:55,220
we've got train wreck and we,
this is our specials,

1730
01:17:55,221 --> 01:17:56,420
you know,
and stuff like that.

1731
01:17:56,421 --> 01:17:58,250
And it's great.
People Review it.

1732
01:17:58,400 --> 01:17:59,300
Oh,
it's incredible.

1733
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:04,540
Amazing that.
So at this point it's so free here in 

1734
01:18:04,540 --> 01:18:05,900
California that it literally is like pot
is legal.

1735
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:06,650
It's just,

1736
01:18:07,180 --> 01:18:08,050
it's very close.
Right?

1737
01:18:08,051 --> 01:18:09,110
Like what's in between,
like,

1738
01:18:09,210 --> 01:18:09,870
like what's,

1739
01:18:10,110 --> 01:18:15,110
well they've passed one step of a 
multistep process to making it illegal 

1740
01:18:15,110 --> 01:18:17,130
for responsible use for adults over.
You know,

1741
01:18:17,140 --> 01:18:21,600
I'll probably be over 18 or 21.
I mean it should be over 18 I think.

1742
01:18:21,601 --> 01:18:24,570
I think that's reasonable.
You know like alcohol I think.

1743
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:27,840
I think alcohol should be 18 with 
supervision,

1744
01:18:28,740 --> 01:18:29,760
meaning like,
you know,

1745
01:18:29,761 --> 01:18:34,761
it should be okay for like your dad 
gives you a beer when you're 18 years 

1746
01:18:34,761 --> 01:18:34,761
old,
you know,

1747
01:18:34,761 --> 01:18:37,160
or you come with your dad to a place 
where his buddy has a bar and you know,

1748
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:39,560
just going to call him a boy beers 
number that'll be here before,

1749
01:18:39,690 --> 01:18:41,490
you know,
slowly introduce them into the world and

1750
01:18:41,491 --> 01:18:46,491
make it like it's no big deal.
You've got to learn how to hold your 

1751
01:18:46,491 --> 01:18:46,491
liquor.
Okay.

1752
01:18:46,491 --> 01:18:47,430
I understand.
And from your fucking father,

1753
01:18:47,431 --> 01:18:49,530
you know what I'm saying?
Like as a young man,

1754
01:18:49,830 --> 01:18:53,280
I let him take away all of the mystique 
of what alcohol really is.

1755
01:18:53,430 --> 01:18:58,430
And that should be the same thing with 
the real problem with any thing that 

1756
01:18:58,430 --> 01:19:01,941
affects your mind is that we don't have 
enough people out there that are 

1757
01:19:01,941 --> 01:19:02,940
explaining to people how to manage that 
shit.

1758
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:08,240
And with alcoholics,
at least they have alcoholics anonymous 

1759
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:10,611
and you know,
they can help guide you back on the 

1760
01:19:10,611 --> 01:19:10,611
right track.
But you know,

1761
01:19:10,611 --> 01:19:13,881
there's no,
no people out there that are telling 

1762
01:19:13,881 --> 01:19:13,881
you,
you know,

1763
01:19:13,881 --> 01:19:13,881
like explaining to you how to 
incorporate.

1764
01:19:13,881 --> 01:19:17,040
We'd successfully in your life for the 
maximum benefits,

1765
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:18,450
you know,
I mean shit,

1766
01:19:18,460 --> 01:19:21,960
maybe we should write a book about that 
because it's a fucking good idea because

1767
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:25,830
what really we need in this country,
and it sounds like all spiritual,

1768
01:19:25,831 --> 01:19:30,831
crazy Voodoo,
but we need Sharmane and what a shaman 

1769
01:19:30,831 --> 01:19:33,330
is in like in the Amazon rainforest of 
the guys would make the IOWASCA.

1770
01:19:33,510 --> 01:19:35,490
It's a dude who's been there,
done that.

1771
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:38,270
He's done it a thousand times.
She knows what to expect.

1772
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:40,890
He knows what's gonna happen.
He's not scared of it.

1773
01:19:40,950 --> 01:19:44,190
He enjoys and welcomes the experience.
He could talk you through it.

1774
01:19:44,191 --> 01:19:46,650
You don't have to freak the fuck out.
This guy is going to help you,

1775
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:49,140
he's going to sing songs,
going to comfort you,

1776
01:19:49,230 --> 01:19:54,230
they're going to play the drums and 
you're going to get to talk to dead 

1777
01:19:54,230 --> 01:19:54,230
people.
I mean,

1778
01:19:54,230 --> 01:19:58,340
that's what it is.
It's a showman and we need a shaman for 

1779
01:19:58,340 --> 01:19:59,670
marijuana and we really could use a 
shotgun for alcohol to this.

1780
01:19:59,671 --> 01:20:02,490
She would be someone who culturally 
explained to the group.

1781
01:20:02,491 --> 01:20:07,491
I mean,
there should be like expressed as an 

1782
01:20:07,491 --> 01:20:09,771
ethic through the entire human community
that it's wrong to be drunk and 

1783
01:20:09,771 --> 01:20:14,751
obnoxious and be a fucking douche bag 
and ruined other people's good time and 

1784
01:20:14,751 --> 01:20:14,751
that should be something we all agree 
upon.

1785
01:20:14,751 --> 01:20:16,370
Shouldn't be something funny like,
Oh,

1786
01:20:16,371 --> 01:20:18,810
maybe I told him he got drunk and rip 
the girl shirt.

1787
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:22,770
That should be horrifying to everyone 
involved.

1788
01:20:22,980 --> 01:20:27,980
We should.
All that is is the reason why we don't 

1789
01:20:27,980 --> 01:20:28,980
address that is we have this crazy way 
of looking at drugs.

1790
01:20:28,981 --> 01:20:30,970
We look at drugs like [inaudible] and 
they're all bad.

1791
01:20:31,130 --> 01:20:36,130
They're all under this.
Same is one gigantic carpet of 

1792
01:20:36,130 --> 01:20:37,950
everything's bad for you,
so it's not necessarily bad for you.

1793
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:41,130
It's only bad for some people.
It's good for some people.

1794
01:20:41,131 --> 01:20:43,920
The experience is benefit you then make 
your life more interesting.

1795
01:20:45,090 --> 01:20:47,610
Should Sharman be driving while giving 
advice?

1796
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:53,600
Do you have to promise me if you get 18 
year old and then that person just got 

1797
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:53,600
their license two years ago,
they don't.

1798
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:54,650
Not to fucking drive,
you know,

1799
01:20:54,910 --> 01:20:55,960
drive reckless.
Yeah.

1800
01:20:56,070 --> 01:20:58,450
It drive too fast and then they're not 
good at it.

1801
01:20:58,451 --> 01:20:59,940
That was me.
I was terrible driver.

1802
01:21:00,450 --> 01:21:02,710
So lucky and I have a dwi.
Yeah,

1803
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:03,550
yeah,
yeah.

1804
01:21:03,670 --> 01:21:04,730
Do you ever get one?
No.

1805
01:21:04,750 --> 01:21:07,600
Never got one.
Yeah.

1806
01:21:07,810 --> 01:21:11,470
I never drove that drunk,
but I probably could have like,

1807
01:21:11,530 --> 01:21:12,990
you know,
the legal limit is like

1808
01:21:13,650 --> 01:21:15,600
I try to do one day or an hour pretty 
much.

1809
01:21:15,660 --> 01:21:16,550
It's one bear.
Yeah.

1810
01:21:16,810 --> 01:21:19,080
Have you had one beer and you get pulled
over 20 minutes later?

1811
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:22,520
I bet you could probably get nailed.
Maybe if you say borderline

1812
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:24,250
for a half an hour.
The second beer.

1813
01:21:24,290 --> 01:21:25,840
Right.
That's crazy.

1814
01:21:26,170 --> 01:21:28,240
But with a lot of people,
that's good man.

1815
01:21:28,241 --> 01:21:30,310
You really should.
They really shouldn't be driving anthony

1816
01:21:30,311 --> 01:21:32,600
from opie and Anthony has a really 
interesting point.

1817
01:21:32,630 --> 01:21:34,420
It's like,
what if I'm good but I drive drunk,

1818
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:37,090
but that's not a good point.
If you kill a kid,

1819
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:39,430
you know,
slammed into a family.

1820
01:21:39,460 --> 01:21:41,980
Well I would say I'm better than average
driving drunk,

1821
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:44,890
but you know,
there's no test for that.

1822
01:21:44,950 --> 01:21:49,950
You know,
unfortunately they came to sit you down 

1823
01:21:49,950 --> 01:21:49,950
and go,
okay,

1824
01:21:49,950 --> 01:21:51,260
you got to play fucking pole position 
for an hour and skills.

1825
01:21:51,290 --> 01:21:52,880
That's thing about marijuana.

1826
01:21:53,210 --> 01:21:54,940
If people are just more cautious when 
they're it,

1827
01:21:55,130 --> 01:22:00,130
you know,
people think that marijuana affects 

1828
01:22:00,130 --> 01:22:00,130
your,
your reaction.

1829
01:22:00,130 --> 01:22:00,130
It doesn't,
it really doesn't.

1830
01:22:00,130 --> 01:22:02,630
I smoked marijuana and I do Jujitsu all 
the time.

1831
01:22:02,750 --> 01:22:05,720
So does Eddie Bravo.
So like a bunch of different,

1832
01:22:05,721 --> 01:22:08,210
like really high level Brazilian Jiu 
Jitsu guys,

1833
01:22:08,211 --> 01:22:13,211
I forget about me.
I know guys that are like world 

1834
01:22:13,211 --> 01:22:16,031
championship,
black belts that love to get high and 

1835
01:22:16,031 --> 01:22:19,391
then go do Jujitsu.
Like it makes them connected to the 

1836
01:22:19,391 --> 01:22:19,391
movements better.
It's makes you,

1837
01:22:19,391 --> 01:22:20,840
it's your very coordinated when you're 
high,

1838
01:22:21,140 --> 01:22:23,930
but it's more like we were talking about
earlier with like being paranoid.

1839
01:22:23,931 --> 01:22:26,960
Paranoia is like too much information.
You don't know how to manage it.

1840
01:22:26,961 --> 01:22:29,160
It's not that it's a bad thing,
it's a,

1841
01:22:29,180 --> 01:22:32,150
you're just getting too much info.
You're not keeping up with it.

1842
01:22:32,180 --> 01:22:33,230
That's where it all comes from.

1843
01:22:34,170 --> 01:22:35,050
Dan,
check this out.

1844
01:22:35,540 --> 01:22:39,910
His cousin was going to jail,
but after having the t,

1845
01:22:40,060 --> 01:22:43,620
two Duis,
but the policeman that arrested him died

1846
01:22:43,980 --> 01:22:48,040
and so now you know,
there's no proof or whatever.

1847
01:22:50,350 --> 01:22:51,370
That's crazy luck

1848
01:22:53,530 --> 01:22:54,610
for everybody.
But the cop.

1849
01:22:54,730 --> 01:22:57,230
Yeah.
Joe,

1850
01:22:57,231 --> 01:22:59,660
you're going to be on celebrity rehab 
the next few years.

1851
01:22:59,810 --> 01:23:00,560
Oh,
totally.

1852
01:23:00,620 --> 01:23:01,880
Have you watched that show?
Yes.

1853
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:04,430
I watched one episode because Stan hope 
was mocking.

1854
01:23:04,431 --> 01:23:05,330
Dr Drew.
I said,

1855
01:23:05,331 --> 01:23:05,980
I let me check this

1856
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:06,720
out.
It's like,

1857
01:23:06,730 --> 01:23:07,720
wow,
what a train wreck.

1858
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:09,130
I mean,
it's crazy.

1859
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:10,680
It's fun to watch.
I'm not addicted.

1860
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:15,800
Is there anything that I could stop?
I don't have a problem with anything 

1861
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:15,800
right now.
I used to have,

1862
01:23:16,250 --> 01:23:18,450
you know,
my real problem has never been drugs.

1863
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:23,600
My real problem is games.
I have a serious addiction to video 

1864
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:27,621
games and to pool pool I think is a 
little bit more meditation because it's 

1865
01:23:27,621 --> 01:23:32,601
like a lot of handoff coordination and 
you have to steady your nerves and it's 

1866
01:23:32,601 --> 01:23:32,601
all,
you know,

1867
01:23:32,601 --> 01:23:34,920
controlling the ball.
But I get obsessed with games.

1868
01:23:35,060 --> 01:23:40,060
I got what I get when I play.
I used to play quake and I used to play 

1869
01:23:40,060 --> 01:23:41,790
no bullshit eight hours a day at least 
every day I was online.

1870
01:23:41,791 --> 01:23:44,850
I loved it and I've,
I'm avoiding that on purpose.

1871
01:23:44,851 --> 01:23:48,390
So if I had like a PR thing that I 
needed to kick at any point in my life,

1872
01:23:48,570 --> 01:23:50,760
it was never drugs and drugs weren't 
ruining my life,

1873
01:23:50,761 --> 01:23:52,560
but video games were kind of running my 
life.

1874
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:54,170
Not ruining it,
but they were.

1875
01:23:54,210 --> 01:23:55,740
It was becoming an,
an obsession.

1876
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:58,110
The problem is I enjoy the fuck out of 
it.

1877
01:23:58,580 --> 01:24:01,250
Quake is so goddamn fun.
You know,

1878
01:24:01,550 --> 01:24:03,260
we're gonna try to create a capsule.
You never.

1879
01:24:03,420 --> 01:24:04,930
What's that?
You're trying to quit caffeine.

1880
01:24:04,950 --> 01:24:05,460
Yeah,
I've quit.

1881
01:24:05,461 --> 01:24:06,780
Caffeine should.
It's hard.

1882
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:07,710
It is hard.
Or,

1883
01:24:07,711 --> 01:24:09,300
you know,
when I realized that I needed to quit,

1884
01:24:09,301 --> 01:24:11,760
I was writing a blog a day,
you know,

1885
01:24:11,770 --> 01:24:14,580
that one time before a film my special,
I wrote a blog every day.

1886
01:24:14,670 --> 01:24:19,670
So I was up every night really late 
because that's when I write my best 

1887
01:24:19,670 --> 01:24:22,311
shit.
So every night I was drinking coffee at 

1888
01:24:22,311 --> 01:24:22,311
like 10:00
and I was,

1889
01:24:22,311 --> 01:24:23,550
I mean,
this kind of coffee too.

1890
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:27,000
I don't fuck around.
I use a French press,

1891
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:29,550
you know,
it's like I grind my own coffee,

1892
01:24:29,730 --> 01:24:34,730
you know,
you get a bird grinder and I give these 

1893
01:24:34,730 --> 01:24:35,820
beans only from these Kona beans from 
Hawaii and my favorite.

1894
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:40,900
This coffee will fuck your world up.
This shit is strong and I will take it 

1895
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:41,760
at like 10:00
at night.

1896
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,700
And Man I couldn't get to bed until 
five,

1897
01:24:44,701 --> 01:24:45,480
6:00
in the morning.

1898
01:24:45,481 --> 01:24:49,230
And then when they finally did crash I 
felt like shit the next day and I did it

1899
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:52,140
a bunch of days in a row that I tried to
stop and we're going to stop.

1900
01:24:52,141 --> 01:24:56,430
I got these serious headaches but dull,
like pressing headaches.

1901
01:24:56,640 --> 01:24:59,190
Like it didn't even feel like coffee 
could fix him.

1902
01:24:59,490 --> 01:25:00,390
It felt like I just

1903
01:25:00,550 --> 01:25:02,220
like a short circuit.
My brain

1904
01:25:03,270 --> 01:25:05,700
fuck is calling me podcast.

1905
01:25:07,380 --> 01:25:08,190
Perfect.

1906
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:19,530
My apologies.
Ladies and gentlemen,

1907
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:25,500
don't you feel less energy at doing 
exercising after you smoke weed?

1908
01:25:26,050 --> 01:25:27,220
No,
I'm the opposite.

1909
01:25:27,221 --> 01:25:28,960
I've,
especially if it's a good sativa,

1910
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:35,640
people that are outside of California,
most of what you're getting is called 

1911
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:37,450
indigo and indigo is a very different 
kind of marijuana.

1912
01:25:37,451 --> 01:25:39,460
Then Sativa.
There's two types.

1913
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:42,310
There's Endeca,
which is like relaxed couch.

1914
01:25:42,311 --> 01:25:43,920
We'd like,
oh dude,

1915
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:45,610
just go and chill.
You know what I'm saying?

1916
01:25:45,890 --> 01:25:50,890
That's Oji Kush weed.
That's the way that makes you want to 

1917
01:25:50,890 --> 01:25:51,910
eat and fuck up your diet man diet,
you know,

1918
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,460
but sativa is,
I want to watch a documentary.

1919
01:25:54,461 --> 01:25:55,780
Sativa is,
you know,

1920
01:25:55,810 --> 01:26:00,810
you want to watch the cosmos and see 
Carl Sagan on TV and cross seg and by 

1921
01:26:00,810 --> 01:26:01,930
the way,
small pot every day.

1922
01:26:02,110 --> 01:26:04,250
That was the shit.
And the crossing was a huge

1923
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:09,250
activist and advocate of marijuana and 
enhancing perceptions with bx.

1924
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:12,060
This guy.
Shit,

1925
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:15,170
I understand that you and Brian had a 
little falling out.

1926
01:26:15,260 --> 01:26:17,170
Okay.
Let's just be nice though.

1927
01:26:17,350 --> 01:26:18,680
There's no need to get crazy.

1928
01:26:20,250 --> 01:26:22,740
People are so emo.
Yeah.

1929
01:26:22,741 --> 01:26:24,670
There's a lot of email people.
The mark.

1930
01:26:24,671 --> 01:26:29,671
Aiden,
I wonder which God has got the Mark 

1931
01:26:29,671 --> 01:26:29,671
Gaydon now a lot of people have the 
markets.

1932
01:26:29,671 --> 01:26:30,420
Mark.
No,

1933
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:34,260
I heard it's not.
Sounds like a goddamn questions.

1934
01:26:34,290 --> 01:26:36,600
This guy says I grow two strains.
Sativa.

1935
01:26:37,130 --> 01:26:37,880
You're right.
Joe.

1936
01:26:37,970 --> 01:26:42,970
First of all,
don't ever say your and spell it like 

1937
01:26:42,970 --> 01:26:42,970
that.
You argue why?

1938
01:26:42,970 --> 01:26:42,970
Oh,
you.

1939
01:26:42,970 --> 01:26:43,310
He didn't spell.
You are,

1940
01:26:43,311 --> 01:26:47,450
which is the gayest way ever.
What are you a little girl texting your.

1941
01:26:47,570 --> 01:26:48,860
I hate that.
Why?

1942
01:26:48,950 --> 01:26:50,090
Oh,
you.

1943
01:26:50,570 --> 01:26:52,840
And it's not an art.
There's an apostrophe and,

1944
01:26:52,841 --> 01:26:54,860
and there's an Ra.
It's short for you are.

1945
01:26:54,861 --> 01:26:56,870
It's not short for something.
I own you motherfucker.

1946
01:26:57,430 --> 01:27:01,470
Have you been playing quake live at all?
I fucked that up all the time.

1947
01:27:01,471 --> 01:27:04,890
Now everybody,
you were your mistake.

1948
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:10,220
You're writing.
Especially if you can type fairly 

1949
01:27:10,220 --> 01:27:10,220
quickly.
You just things come on.

1950
01:27:10,220 --> 01:27:13,980
Fuck that.
So I was thinking about getting a 

1951
01:27:13,980 --> 01:27:15,301
regular phone,
a skinny like razor phone on verizon 

1952
01:27:15,301 --> 01:27:18,961
network and then getting the IPAD.
So like if I'm like out my car,

1953
01:27:20,510 --> 01:27:25,510
pull up my ipad,
have a better internet but have a solid 

1954
01:27:25,510 --> 01:27:25,510
phone.

1955
01:27:25,510 --> 01:27:25,510
Hm,

1956
01:27:26,030 --> 01:27:27,440
go.
So you're going to go back.

1957
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:28,770
Go back.
I think just as well.

1958
01:27:28,890 --> 01:27:31,730
But what if someone sends you a picture?
A video on your phone?

1959
01:27:31,731 --> 01:27:33,990
Some asshole.
I can't believe this.

1960
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:34,670
Check this out.

1961
01:27:34,830 --> 01:27:35,700
Did that now?
Yeah.

1962
01:27:35,870 --> 01:27:38,190
You know,
why did they go with 18 and t?

1963
01:27:38,700 --> 01:27:40,480
Well you don't have to,
you know,

1964
01:27:41,470 --> 01:27:42,820
here's the thing.
No one's thinking of this.

1965
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:45,200
They have those modifiers now.
So you just have your mind,

1966
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:47,810
a verizon network and now you have 
horizon anywhere you go,

1967
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:49,970
you know?
Really?

1968
01:27:50,450 --> 01:27:55,450
Yeah.
They have these boxes that connect and 

1969
01:27:55,450 --> 01:27:55,450
then broadcast wireless.
It's called,

1970
01:27:55,450 --> 01:27:57,080
if I remember I showed you,
they're about this big.

1971
01:27:57,140 --> 01:28:02,140
So if you have a little case,
like a statue that you have your ipad 

1972
01:28:02,140 --> 01:28:02,140
in,
just have that,

1973
01:28:02,140 --> 01:28:04,070
throw that in there,
turn it on and you have verizon.

1974
01:28:04,130 --> 01:28:07,790
Wherever you go to this motherfucker 
just hacking the system bitches.

1975
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:10,040
And that's another thing that's going to
be big man.

1976
01:28:10,041 --> 01:28:12,020
Persons are going to have to come back 
because of this thing.

1977
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:15,620
You know you're a big advocate of the 
marriage.

1978
01:28:16,030 --> 01:28:19,190
I actually bought a domain name and I 
told her I was addicted to domain names.

1979
01:28:19,191 --> 01:28:23,410
I bought IPAD sling.
So if you know anyone that's like,

1980
01:28:24,410 --> 01:28:29,410
oh shit,
you know anyone that makes versus just 

1981
01:28:29,410 --> 01:28:29,690
my laptop.
No,

1982
01:28:29,710 --> 01:28:33,990
I don't know anybody that makes purses.
Guys don't wear

1983
01:28:34,380 --> 01:28:35,480
man,
man.

1984
01:28:35,590 --> 01:28:36,360
Man,
man.

1985
01:28:36,430 --> 01:28:38,540
Pouch those,
those men bags,

1986
01:28:38,660 --> 01:28:42,310
they look like a fucking purse to me.
Fanny pack looks like a manly choice.

1987
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:45,800
Family Pact doesn't though.
The Chin.

1988
01:28:46,190 --> 01:28:49,340
All your stuff is right there.
So one wants something just unzipped and

1989
01:28:49,341 --> 01:28:50,050
he gave it to him.
Right.

1990
01:28:50,290 --> 01:28:54,490
See I liked my little man purse that 
looks because it's made for guns.

1991
01:28:54,580 --> 01:28:59,580
So it looks like a gun.
Satua base will fit the IPAD so it 

1992
01:28:59,580 --> 01:29:01,470
doesn't look natural.
It looks like it was for jewelry.

1993
01:29:01,740 --> 01:29:03,760
No makeup.
I haven't reviewed that.

1994
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:07,430
Stick in and mirrors.
Yeah,

1995
01:29:07,431 --> 01:29:12,431
but you like,
like you got to go do the Disney family 

1996
01:29:15,030 --> 01:29:20,030
asked fucking fanny pack.
I like fanny packs are wearing all the 

1997
01:29:20,030 --> 01:29:23,841
time.
She didn't have a company and then you 

1998
01:29:23,841 --> 01:29:24,360
can also sell ice or ipad slang.
I don't want to sell them Ipad,

1999
01:29:24,370 --> 01:29:27,090
sling and not buying the I pad,
but I,

2000
01:29:27,091 --> 01:29:30,780
if I didn't have a kindle,
I would see what you're saying and.

2001
01:29:31,050 --> 01:29:33,330
But wait,
if you want to buy a portable DVD player

2002
01:29:33,331 --> 01:29:34,980
for the car or something,
we're like,

2003
01:29:35,010 --> 01:29:36,430
you want a good one though?
It was like,

2004
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:41,500
don't you pay a little extra if you 
could download the movies while you're 

2005
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:41,500
in the car?

2006
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:41,500
Okay.
First of all,

2007
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:43,910
how dope would it be if you had a screen
in your car and stopped?

2008
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:44,940
No.
You can do that.

2009
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,400
You could make that screen in your car 
and install it as a screen.

2010
01:29:47,401 --> 01:29:48,270
Yeah,
you could totally do.

2011
01:29:48,271 --> 01:29:50,870
That was thing that on the way over,
imagine that gps.

2012
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:56,360
That might be the greatest thing ever 
and it's got to see how many inches is 

2013
01:29:56,360 --> 01:29:56,990
that?
It's nine point seven inches across.

2014
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,280
So thin.
They could just sit,

2015
01:29:58,330 --> 01:30:01,200
fit it right in your car and you feel 
your dashboard fitted for it.

2016
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:03,480
Whoa.
You know what's really funny is a lot of

2017
01:30:03,481 --> 01:30:05,770
people are bashing it.
That's not widescreen.

2018
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:08,730
Well alright there's going to be the bar
on the top and the bottom.

2019
01:30:08,850 --> 01:30:10,980
So they wanted a white skin.
So what do you mean?

2020
01:30:11,250 --> 01:30:14,430
They wanted us to.
They wanted them to chop off the top and

2021
01:30:14,431 --> 01:30:19,431
bottom or make it bigger.
If you make it bigger than that thing 

2022
01:30:19,431 --> 01:30:20,430
would be this big but widescreen.
So it's like a letterbox thing.

2023
01:30:20,431 --> 01:30:22,350
When you watch a video you see a little 
black stripe

2024
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:28,160
but that's what they had to do.
That's what did to people don't get 

2025
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:29,280
widescreen.
It'll kill it.

2026
01:30:29,550 --> 01:30:34,550
It definitely is better to have 
something that you can read books and 

2027
01:30:34,550 --> 01:30:34,550
watch movies on if you look at it that 
way.

2028
01:30:35,100 --> 01:30:40,100
But the way I am video games still's not
that appealing to me because I already 

2029
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:42,450
have a laptop and if I'm going to spend 
time like what is it going to give me?

2030
01:30:42,460 --> 01:30:43,740
The.
The laptop's not going to.

2031
01:30:44,070 --> 01:30:45,670
I can watch movies on the laptop.
I'm,

2032
01:30:45,671 --> 01:30:46,470
which will be done.
That.

2033
01:30:46,830 --> 01:30:48,780
What else can I do?
I get online on that.

2034
01:30:48,810 --> 01:30:52,140
I get on my laptop better.
So what am I doing with it?

2035
01:30:52,650 --> 01:30:54,750
The applications really and why?

2036
01:30:54,860 --> 01:30:55,430
No,
all right.

2037
01:30:55,431 --> 01:31:00,431
It's the size of a book,
so what they're saying is that what if 

2038
01:31:00,431 --> 01:31:00,530
you use it like you have a razor phone 
in your pocket,

2039
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:05,680
you go into the comedy club and you have
this little thing the size of a little 

2040
01:31:05,680 --> 01:31:05,680
notepad.
It's in a little leather pouch.

2041
01:31:05,680 --> 01:31:09,991
Him keep that bitch in your pocket.
You're going to pretend that you going 

2042
01:31:09,991 --> 01:31:09,991
to carry this thing around with you 
everywhere.

2043
01:31:09,991 --> 01:31:09,991
Well,
no,

2044
01:31:09,991 --> 01:31:10,490
you throw it in the car.
It's like a.

2045
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:12,560
It looks like a little book.
It's a little book,

2046
01:31:12,620 --> 01:31:17,620
you know,
so you throw it in the car so that you 

2047
01:31:17,620 --> 01:31:17,620
could use it when you're out,
when you're out.

2048
01:31:17,620 --> 01:31:19,580
You if you have it in the like Steve 
Jobs,

2049
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:24,840
people are going to bring interesting to
restaurants and instead of texting 

2050
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:25,700
they're going to be sitting there moving
books,

2051
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:29,390
doing little g emails,
checking their calendars.

2052
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,050
Steve Jobs,
you bashed.

2053
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:33,710
I think people are Basset and freaking 
out about it because there's a couple of

2054
01:31:33,711 --> 01:31:37,130
things that it doesn't do or doesn't do 
flash and stuff,

2055
01:31:37,190 --> 01:31:39,480
but that's another reason.
Have jobs just fucking this up.

2056
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:42,830
I think on the market people are going 
to go crazy for it.

2057
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:45,360
Analogy.
Alright,

2058
01:31:45,410 --> 01:31:48,740
let's read some questions from these 
people gears of war.

2059
01:31:48,741 --> 01:31:50,900
Fuck you have.
That game was awesome.

2060
01:31:51,620 --> 01:31:53,360
That's another game.
I'm scared of that game.

2061
01:31:54,290 --> 01:31:59,290
I don't want to get locked in that world
of playing that Shit online everyday to 

2062
01:31:59,290 --> 01:31:59,770
fun,
man.

2063
01:32:00,460 --> 01:32:03,820
We got a chance to see that early on.
We got a chance.

2064
01:32:03,821 --> 01:32:07,180
We were in North Carolina and I met 
cliff.

2065
01:32:07,181 --> 01:32:11,470
He be from epic games and he got us in 
and we gotta look at the models of.

2066
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:14,710
Gives a war way before it was released.
It was fucking crazy.

2067
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:17,510
The new stuff.
They're working on these new entities to

2068
01:32:17,511 --> 01:32:20,040
do so insane.
Like he,

2069
01:32:20,050 --> 01:32:25,050
he showed us a demo,
some of the stuff and the guys at ID 

2070
01:32:25,050 --> 01:32:27,541
software did to Tim Wilson and Todd 
Hollingshead and John Carmack and those 

2071
01:32:27,971 --> 01:32:29,320
guys.
Those guys are super cool.

2072
01:32:29,321 --> 01:32:34,321
They,
they let us come and check out all the 

2073
01:32:34,321 --> 01:32:34,321
new stuff they're doing.
That's my favorite all time games quick.

2074
01:32:34,321 --> 01:32:34,870
But like I said,
I'm scared.

2075
01:32:35,250 --> 01:32:36,670
Did you know that there is a,
uh,

2076
01:32:36,740 --> 01:32:41,740
they did a report on a browser,
crashes on computers and I think it was 

2077
01:32:43,210 --> 01:32:47,650
85 percent of all browser crashes were 
because of Flash.

2078
01:32:48,520 --> 01:32:50,410
Whoa,
that's a big number.

2079
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:52,940
Whoa.
80 five.

2080
01:32:52,941 --> 01:32:55,230
Because other than flashed you got 
javascript.

2081
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:58,580
He got a couple of things,
but 85 percent of that's crazy.

2082
01:32:58,581 --> 01:33:02,870
Like how has that allowed people to say 
people are freaking out about something.

2083
01:33:02,871 --> 01:33:04,340
It's a plugin,
you know,

2084
01:33:04,460 --> 01:33:05,660
html five point.
Oh,

2085
01:33:05,670 --> 01:33:08,960
is about to come out which will make 
flash pretty much unnecessary.

2086
01:33:09,950 --> 01:33:14,950
How's it make less on this?
Well see the problem is they started 

2087
01:33:14,950 --> 01:33:16,280
using flash back in the day because that
was an easy way to take video,

2088
01:33:16,281 --> 01:33:21,281
put it on the Internet so anyone can 
watch it because people's Internet 

2089
01:33:21,281 --> 01:33:23,360
connections kind of sucked and you know,
and it was in one format.

2090
01:33:23,570 --> 01:33:24,640
What html?
Five point.

2091
01:33:24,641 --> 01:33:25,930
Oh days.
It's pretty much make,

2092
01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:28,970
I think it's h,
two point six for like the video.

2093
01:33:28,971 --> 01:33:32,040
We'll just play in the browser,
kind of like our gift works,

2094
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:37,080
you know,
like animated Gif will work no matter 

2095
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:37,250
what because it's made in the coating of
the browser.

2096
01:33:37,370 --> 01:33:39,530
So this will make videos and stuff like 
that.

2097
01:33:39,770 --> 01:33:42,720
Just be in the,
in the coding and just work right now.

2098
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:47,990
So guess who's who gets,
who's making our editing,

2099
01:33:47,991 --> 01:33:51,660
the html l point,
five point zero coding.

2100
01:33:51,770 --> 01:33:56,770
This is kind of interesting.
A guy that works at Google and the guy 

2101
01:33:56,770 --> 01:33:56,770
that works at Apple,

2102
01:33:58,270 --> 01:34:01,520
so you have long had this theory that 
um,

2103
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:05,770
that there's a battle going on between a
apple and flash.

2104
01:34:05,771 --> 01:34:10,771
And you think that one of the reasons 
why apple has such a hard time working 

2105
01:34:10,771 --> 01:34:12,730
with flash and make it shitty on purpose
so that people move away from flash.

2106
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:17,840
Well,
I think that's a good good theory 

2107
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:17,840
definitely.
But the big thing is,

2108
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:21,951
is that like no one in silicon valley 
works together like Amazon and apple and

2109
01:34:22,841 --> 01:34:25,320
they're all not working together as a 
team.

2110
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:29,280
They're all like having to fight and do.
And you know,

2111
01:34:29,340 --> 01:34:31,020
like the opposite of what this person's 
doing.

2112
01:34:31,021 --> 01:34:36,021
Like,
like if a flash releases a new plugin 

2113
01:34:36,021 --> 01:34:38,220
that works with firefox and or whatever 
it but doesn't work for safari,

2114
01:34:38,370 --> 01:34:43,370
they're trying to work for safari.
Safari changes something and then it 

2115
01:34:43,370 --> 01:34:43,370
fucks all their shit up.
You know,

2116
01:34:43,370 --> 01:34:47,620
it's constantly like that with 
everything in silicon valley because 

2117
01:34:47,620 --> 01:34:47,620
they don't work together.
They work together.

2118
01:34:47,620 --> 01:34:50,460
Just thing is going to go understand 
seeing conspiracy behind.

2119
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:54,110
If I'm sensing flashes getting pushed 
out for some reason.

2120
01:34:54,111 --> 01:34:57,650
Mostly because of the security reasons.
It's very open a,

2121
01:34:57,680 --> 01:35:02,090
you can get hacked and security with 
flash and stuff like that.

2122
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:04,610
Uh,
and I think it's getting pushed out,

2123
01:35:04,670 --> 01:35:06,260
especially when html five point.
Oh,

2124
01:35:06,261 --> 01:35:08,480
comes out,
which is probably coming soon.

2125
01:35:08,860 --> 01:35:09,790
Hey she.
Five point.

2126
01:35:09,791 --> 01:35:11,420
Oh,
can't do with flash does buddy.

2127
01:35:11,421 --> 01:35:14,720
And it's proprietary CODEC.
It's what?

2128
01:35:14,930 --> 01:35:17,060
This is what this guy says.
Filbert double o seven.

2129
01:35:17,250 --> 01:35:18,460
Yeah.
Yeah.

2130
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:21,730
Go,
go google search tml.

2131
01:35:21,731 --> 01:35:24,580
Five point zero.
Go look at wikipedia or whatever,

2132
01:35:24,700 --> 01:35:26,290
you know,
even explain it in there.

2133
01:35:26,291 --> 01:35:28,900
It's pretty much known that once html 
five point,

2134
01:35:28,901 --> 01:35:29,530
oh,
comes out.

2135
01:35:29,531 --> 01:35:31,790
That flashed for the most part,
it's going to

2136
01:35:31,880 --> 01:35:34,220
be hurting.
Okay.

2137
01:35:34,221 --> 01:35:36,230
Well,
the gauntlet has been thrown down.

2138
01:35:36,290 --> 01:35:38,360
A challenge has been made.

2139
01:35:39,420 --> 01:35:41,970
Youtube has already switched over to all
their videos to five point.

2140
01:35:41,971 --> 01:35:43,190
Oh,
what is this guy's asking?

2141
01:35:43,191 --> 01:35:44,310
What?
So as Vimeo,

2142
01:35:44,340 --> 01:35:45,780
vimeo.com,
I believe,

2143
01:35:45,781 --> 01:35:48,990
just switched over to a to five point.
Oh,

2144
01:35:48,991 --> 01:35:53,991
ready?
Meaning that's why Youtube now works on 

2145
01:35:53,991 --> 01:35:53,991
your iphone.

2146
01:35:53,991 --> 01:35:53,991
Hold on a second.
This guy's asking the question.

2147
01:35:53,991 --> 01:35:56,120
What's with the sensoring on this social
message board?

2148
01:35:56,480 --> 01:35:57,950
Does.
What does the sensor is like?

2149
01:35:57,951 --> 01:36:00,800
If you try to twitter or something and 
you swear or on this,

2150
01:36:00,801 --> 01:36:05,801
would it change it a maybe?
Is that why that guy wrote that fucking 

2151
01:36:05,801 --> 01:36:06,330
like that.
Oh,

2152
01:36:06,410 --> 01:36:07,130
maybe.
I don't know.

2153
01:36:07,490 --> 01:36:09,440
Is that true folks?
You can't swear on this.

2154
01:36:10,990 --> 01:36:12,580
It's probably a setting.
If there is.

2155
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:15,440
Oh it has to be a setting.
Please tell him that setting

2156
01:36:18,090 --> 01:36:19,230
that is,
you know,

2157
01:36:19,290 --> 01:36:21,870
people don't think that's a big deal.
Like I always make a big deal out of the

2158
01:36:21,871 --> 01:36:22,550
fact that,
you know,

2159
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:23,940
censorship,
certain words,

2160
01:36:24,210 --> 01:36:24,960
you know,
and people say,

2161
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:26,280
what's the big deal?
You know,

2162
01:36:26,281 --> 01:36:27,300
why?
Why do you have to be rude?

2163
01:36:27,301 --> 01:36:32,301
Why can't you just not say those 
particular words or in your own certain 

2164
01:36:32,301 --> 01:36:33,690
people or in certain situations like 
that's a way of controlling us.

2165
01:36:33,691 --> 01:36:35,910
It's nonsense.
It makes no sense whatsoever,

2166
01:36:35,930 --> 01:36:38,820
and words don't mean anything other than
intention.

2167
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:41,910
What's important is that you are 
expressing your intention.

2168
01:36:41,911 --> 01:36:43,650
You're expressing what you're.
What you're thinking,

2169
01:36:43,680 --> 01:36:48,060
that the idea of magic words is it's 
poison to the language.

2170
01:36:48,240 --> 01:36:53,240
It's terrible to have words that you 
can't use around certain people and you 

2171
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:54,750
can't use.
When you broadcast them,

2172
01:36:54,751 --> 01:36:57,090
you'd be fined hundreds of thousands of 
dollars.

2173
01:36:57,420 --> 01:37:02,420
That is a just a gigantic distraction 
that's complete total mind control.

2174
01:37:03,060 --> 01:37:07,050
It's a technique that they're using to 
try to control the population.

2175
01:37:07,230 --> 01:37:11,340
There's no other way around it.
There's why outs is censorship,

2176
01:37:11,341 --> 01:37:13,500
is what it offends people.
Why isn't offend people?

2177
01:37:13,590 --> 01:37:16,440
You don't have to listen to it.
The government's going after it.

2178
01:37:16,620 --> 01:37:21,620
Why they're going after they're going 
after it because some people are very 

2179
01:37:21,620 --> 01:37:24,681
offended by it.
Whether it's religious people or you 

2180
01:37:24,681 --> 01:37:24,681
know,
really conservative people,

2181
01:37:24,681 --> 01:37:25,020
but why?
Why the offended by it?

2182
01:37:25,021 --> 01:37:26,940
It's,
it's nonsense.

2183
01:37:26,941 --> 01:37:29,400
It's a fucking huge distraction.
It's just a word.

2184
01:37:29,580 --> 01:37:32,250
Whether you say I fucked her or I had 
sex with her,

2185
01:37:32,370 --> 01:37:34,330
you can't say I fucked her.
Like,

2186
01:37:34,490 --> 01:37:36,150
is that really hurting someone's 
feelings?

2187
01:37:36,180 --> 01:37:37,290
So.
So what happened,

2188
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:38,180
uh,
on the,

2189
01:37:38,220 --> 01:37:43,220
you know,
the night that you proposed to your 

2190
01:37:43,220 --> 01:37:43,220
wife?
Well,

2191
01:37:43,220 --> 01:37:43,220
I fucked her.
You know what I mean?

2192
01:37:43,220 --> 01:37:43,840
It's not a bad.
Well,

2193
01:37:43,990 --> 01:37:45,600
it's actually,
they're the same thing.

2194
01:37:45,601 --> 01:37:50,601
You're saying the same thing.
Like it's not offending me if you say 

2195
01:37:50,601 --> 01:37:50,601
you fucked her,
you know,

2196
01:37:50,601 --> 01:37:52,530
if you say I that fucking hurt,
I'm not going to get.

2197
01:37:52,531 --> 01:37:57,531
Why would I be upset?
What kind of a Douche bag gets if you 

2198
01:37:57,531 --> 01:37:57,531
stub

2199
01:37:57,531 --> 01:37:57,531
your toe and you go,
oh,

2200
01:37:57,531 --> 01:38:02,031
that fucking hurt.
Who gets them out that who the fuck is 

2201
01:38:02,031 --> 01:38:03,780
wrong to say that's it's a trick.

2202
01:38:05,410 --> 01:38:06,460
Yeah.
But if we didn't do that,

2203
01:38:06,461 --> 01:38:09,040
then words wouldn't be as powerful as 
they are now.

2204
01:38:09,070 --> 01:38:11,430
It would be just as powerful.
Do you?

2205
01:38:12,220 --> 01:38:12,810
You're like,
Eh,

2206
01:38:12,811 --> 01:38:14,560
whatever.
I heard fuck you five times a day.

2207
01:38:14,660 --> 01:38:19,660
You hear it was like so exotic word that
nobody used,

2208
01:38:21,730 --> 01:38:26,730
like still has a good amount of zing to.
It is the only one you know other than 

2209
01:38:26,730 --> 01:38:30,541
racial epitaphs.
There has to be a way to turn off the 

2210
01:38:30,541 --> 01:38:30,541
sensoring thing,
right?

2211
01:38:30,541 --> 01:38:30,610
I don't know.
Lazy job.

2212
01:38:30,680 --> 01:38:34,180
Is there a way to turn it off?
The social stream appears to be censored

2213
01:38:34,270 --> 01:38:36,820
because why would they sensor data,
but yet I could say fuck,

2214
01:38:36,830 --> 01:38:41,830
fuck bag right now and it's even worse.
It's how you say it in this man says 

2215
01:38:45,020 --> 01:38:46,150
what?
I let my kids curse.

2216
01:38:46,151 --> 01:38:47,770
Fuck yeah.
It's just words.

2217
01:38:47,820 --> 01:38:50,260
Goddammit.
People are so weird.

2218
01:38:50,270 --> 01:38:51,550
Wow.
You really are censored.

2219
01:38:51,551 --> 01:38:53,380
I don't see a single swear.
No one can swear.

2220
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:57,220
Now everyone has to ride that thing.
I think it's twitter.

2221
01:38:57,221 --> 01:38:58,720
It's not twitter.
It's nuts.

2222
01:38:59,380 --> 01:39:00,550
It must be ustream.
Yeah,

2223
01:39:00,551 --> 01:39:02,900
it's totally username,
but it might be just a second.

2224
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:04,780
You could say anything on twitter.

2225
01:39:05,790 --> 01:39:08,520
Okay,
well that dude who I was talking earlier

2226
01:39:08,940 --> 01:39:10,830
with,
t h cit and we're giving you a hard time

2227
01:39:10,831 --> 01:39:13,710
with the way you wrote something.
I completely apologize Sir.

2228
01:39:13,950 --> 01:39:18,950
I was of line.
I did not know that you actually 

2229
01:39:18,950 --> 01:39:19,110
couldn't write the word fuck and you had
to write all that other nonsense.

2230
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:21,180
My apologies.

2231
01:39:23,020 --> 01:39:25,710
All right,
so it does not look like you can turn it

2232
01:39:25,711 --> 01:39:28,260
off or at least no one's saying 
anything.

2233
01:39:30,100 --> 01:39:32,200
Teach that to a kid and have him repeat 
it in school.

2234
01:39:32,201 --> 01:39:33,400
I don't know what this question was 
about,

2235
01:39:33,401 --> 01:39:33,650
sir.

2236
01:39:35,740 --> 01:39:36,840
Okay.
Well thank you.

2237
01:39:36,841 --> 01:39:39,160
Uh,
Austin Curtis Austin.

2238
01:39:39,161 --> 01:39:41,100
See Curtis,
because if it wasn't for you we wouldn't

2239
01:39:41,230 --> 01:39:43,450
even have known that it is censored.

2240
01:39:45,210 --> 01:39:50,210
This guy says the Bible is just rubbish 
English people such cool things to say 

2241
01:39:50,210 --> 01:39:54,380
rubbish.
I mean that sounds fucking some gay 

2242
01:39:54,380 --> 01:39:55,350
things that they say take a leak,

2243
01:39:55,490 --> 01:39:58,100
but you know what my favorite is proper.
You know,

2244
01:39:58,101 --> 01:40:00,260
like if something like,
oh that's a proper sports car.

2245
01:40:00,390 --> 01:40:01,150
Yeah.
Proper.

2246
01:40:01,400 --> 01:40:06,400
That's like that.
I like when they say that there's 

2247
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:08,160
something that sounds dope about that.
Now that's a proper cell phone.

2248
01:40:08,470 --> 01:40:11,340
No,
you just see it on the telly and telly.

2249
01:40:12,670 --> 01:40:13,070
Telly doesn't.

2250
01:40:14,260 --> 01:40:17,160
I like England on man.
I enjoyed over there doing comedy with.

2251
01:40:17,190 --> 01:40:18,260
It's fun.
Yeah,

2252
01:40:18,340 --> 01:40:19,870
they're fucking cool.
You know,

2253
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:22,900
it's like our comedy translates directly
to them.

2254
01:40:22,930 --> 01:40:25,570
Shake their comedy.
Doesn't translate the same,

2255
01:40:26,050 --> 01:40:31,050
you know,
like their standups don't translate as 

2256
01:40:31,050 --> 01:40:33,340
some of them make it over here.
I mean obviously I'm a Sacha Baron Cohen

2257
01:40:33,341 --> 01:40:35,710
who in my opinion is one of the funniest
guys of all time,

2258
01:40:36,040 --> 01:40:37,370
but he's not really established.
Oh my.

2259
01:40:37,420 --> 01:40:40,810
He's like crazy prankster.
Hilarious guy.

2260
01:40:41,060 --> 01:40:41,320
Yeah.

2261
01:40:41,480 --> 01:40:46,480
You see somebody was fucking a chicken 
on a subway yesterday and somebody 

2262
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:47,630
recorded on video just like,
you know how it saw sat in those.

2263
01:40:47,730 --> 01:40:52,730
Oh,
that's one of the signs of the 

2264
01:40:52,730 --> 01:40:52,730
apocalypse.
Yes it is.

2265
01:40:52,730 --> 01:40:53,260
I think it's on d listed.com.
It hard.

2266
01:40:54,640 --> 01:40:55,750
How did it get hard?
Oh,

2267
01:40:55,751 --> 01:40:59,320
you can say kind of you space it out.
This guy wrote word spaced it out.

2268
01:40:59,321 --> 01:41:02,650
You clever bastard.
Just like Battlestar Galactica.

2269
01:41:02,651 --> 01:41:07,651
They just start changing the words.
There'll be forking and I like that was 

2270
01:41:07,651 --> 01:41:07,651
the craziest thing ever on Battlestar 
Galactica.

2271
01:41:07,651 --> 01:41:11,080
What the frack frack.
Like you could really say that.

2272
01:41:11,170 --> 01:41:16,000
I mean,
so it just shows you how dumb it is that

2273
01:41:16,001 --> 01:41:18,340
we still have magic words that you can't
say.

2274
01:41:23,050 --> 01:41:28,050
Yeah.
People having sex with chickens is 

2275
01:41:28,050 --> 01:41:28,050
freaky.
Have you seen chicken?

2276
01:41:28,050 --> 01:41:28,510
Pork?
Egg Hall is supposed to feel real good.

2277
01:41:31,570 --> 01:41:36,570
It's weird that like some animals,
like sheep are supposed to have like a 

2278
01:41:36,570 --> 01:41:37,270
perfect feeling.
Vagina.

2279
01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:38,920
It's supposed to be just like a real 
one.

2280
01:41:38,980 --> 01:41:40,180
Yeah.
She supposedly.

2281
01:41:40,390 --> 01:41:42,010
Yeah.
This is weird.

2282
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:47,290
I know right now is what Jesus is.
Tau Pet sheeps and shit.

2283
01:41:47,410 --> 01:41:50,560
This dude is putting this advisee.
The dirty banana says,

2284
01:41:50,740 --> 01:41:55,740
my brother in law's a Brit.
I liked when he says proper flucht like 

2285
01:41:55,740 --> 01:41:59,580
when describing trash.
That's totally how they would say it 

2286
01:41:59,580 --> 01:42:00,930
might.
I was proper fucked.

2287
01:42:02,250 --> 01:42:04,650
Wow.
That's a cool fucking thing to say.

2288
01:42:05,820 --> 01:42:07,330
That's.
And you have to say that,

2289
01:42:07,331 --> 01:42:10,740
but that's something you have to say 
with an English accent and say like,

2290
01:42:10,760 --> 01:42:11,440
yeah,
it was.

2291
01:42:11,530 --> 01:42:13,540
I was out there.
We were getting drugging.

2292
01:42:13,620 --> 01:42:18,560
We got to fucking join God and listen.
I was proper fucked people.

2293
01:42:18,610 --> 01:42:19,270
Go what?

2294
01:42:21,370 --> 01:42:23,660
I was proper fucked.
Yeah,

2295
01:42:23,661 --> 01:42:28,370
and the way they say so much better.
They say constantly fucking cunt.

2296
01:42:28,390 --> 01:42:33,390
With a fucking cunt.
Cunt is not as strong over there as it 

2297
01:42:33,390 --> 01:42:34,450
is over here because they say it all the
time.

2298
01:42:34,451 --> 01:42:39,451
It's like they're way more liberal with.
They use the word cut checks a around 

2299
01:42:39,451 --> 01:42:40,800
all the time who hung out with fucking 
counting.

2300
01:42:40,810 --> 01:42:43,830
Cigarette counting is a great word when 
cons.

2301
01:42:43,831 --> 01:42:45,700
Not good enough.
It's counting,

2302
01:42:45,970 --> 01:42:48,370
you know,
it's like takes deeper.

2303
01:42:48,670 --> 01:42:51,300
It's like you're so,
so bored with St John.

2304
01:42:51,460 --> 01:42:53,670
You said con so often.
The n England,

2305
01:42:53,680 --> 01:42:54,630
the end of it.
That's all.

2306
01:42:54,670 --> 01:42:57,700
That's all hard.
You Roll fucking cutting cigarette.

2307
01:42:57,760 --> 01:42:58,840
You know.
You say that man,

2308
01:42:59,080 --> 01:43:02,200
that someone's used to car.
I need a smoke a fag.

2309
01:43:02,530 --> 01:43:04,800
We need a stoner president that would 
get things done.

2310
01:43:04,810 --> 01:43:07,720
Supposedly there's a picture of Obama 
smoking a joint.

2311
01:43:07,980 --> 01:43:10,550
Yeah,
but I don't know if it's a joint count.

2312
01:43:10,820 --> 01:43:11,700
Cigarettes,
no way to tell.

2313
01:43:13,570 --> 01:43:16,090
He's definitely smoked weed before,
but man,

2314
01:43:16,091 --> 01:43:17,950
I don't think there's any way he can be 
doing it now.

2315
01:43:19,060 --> 01:43:20,190
First of all.
Yeah.

2316
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:24,340
We do need a president that sees other 
ways of looking at things.

2317
01:43:24,341 --> 01:43:28,170
That's what we need.
Whether a president's a yoga master does

2318
01:43:28,180 --> 01:43:28,700
it,
you know,

2319
01:43:29,290 --> 01:43:32,440
all naturally or whether our presence of
stoner or whether our presidents.

2320
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:36,710
A guy likes to go into the jungle and 
take Iowasca with the Shaman.

2321
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:40,780
We need someone who has a leader's way 
of seeing the world,

2322
01:43:40,900 --> 01:43:43,540
someone who sees it outside of this 
crazy,

2323
01:43:43,541 --> 01:43:45,550
predetermined pattern that we're on 
right now.

2324
01:43:45,880 --> 01:43:46,540
You know,
I mean,

2325
01:43:46,570 --> 01:43:50,920
I wrote this article about it's on my 
blog about the large hadron collider and

2326
01:43:50,921 --> 01:43:53,480
how crazy it is that like at a certain 
point in time,

2327
01:43:53,481 --> 01:43:58,481
science got to this weird point and I'm 
not trashing it in any way because I'm 

2328
01:43:58,481 --> 01:44:00,560
fascinated by technology.
I'm just making an observation that when

2329
01:44:00,561 --> 01:44:05,561
we first started inventing things,
it was to improve the quality of our 

2330
01:44:05,561 --> 01:44:05,561
life.
You know,

2331
01:44:05,561 --> 01:44:09,550
we invented spheres so that we didn't 
have to chase after the animals and 

2332
01:44:09,550 --> 01:44:09,920
vitamin with our teeth.
We invented things.

2333
01:44:10,010 --> 01:44:12,320
We never rented houses,
so we're surviving to the rank,

2334
01:44:12,380 --> 01:44:15,080
but at a certain point in time it got 
completely

2335
01:44:16,490 --> 01:44:19,070
past that.
And now even though we have all sorts of

2336
01:44:19,071 --> 01:44:24,071
things to deal with with the human race,
like poverty and what's going on in 

2337
01:44:24,071 --> 01:44:25,670
Haiti and Liberia,
the vice guide to Liberia,

2338
01:44:25,671 --> 01:44:30,671
if you haven't seen that document,
God damn these fucking dudes went to 

2339
01:44:30,671 --> 01:44:34,811
Liberia,
which is this crazy nation in Africa 

2340
01:44:34,811 --> 01:44:37,661
that has like rampant cannibalism.
Like people are constantly killing each 

2341
01:44:37,661 --> 01:44:42,491
other and eat each other.
They're selling human meet on the 

2342
01:44:42,491 --> 01:44:42,491
street.
And this,

2343
01:44:42,491 --> 01:44:45,820
I mean,
this one dude talked about he was a 

2344
01:44:45,820 --> 01:44:47,090
warlord.
They called him general button naked and

2345
01:44:47,091 --> 01:44:50,750
this fucking crazy guy would kill babies
and talks about it.

2346
01:44:50,930 --> 01:44:53,450
How he would kill innocent children from
the,

2347
01:44:53,451 --> 01:44:58,451
uh,
opposing tribe or whoever the fuck they 

2348
01:44:58,451 --> 01:45:00,281
were at war with,
cut out their heart and they would all 

2349
01:45:00,281 --> 01:45:02,260
eat the heart and would strengthen them 
for battle and make them vulnerable to 

2350
01:45:02,260 --> 01:45:02,260
bullets.

2351
01:45:02,260 --> 01:45:06,670
He ate a lot of people.
And this guy talks openly about eating 

2352
01:45:06,670 --> 01:45:07,730
people about what you eat.
If you're hungry for hunger,

2353
01:45:07,731 --> 01:45:12,731
you eat like the soft part,
like the stomach and the inside of the 

2354
01:45:12,731 --> 01:45:12,930
thigh because it's tender,
mean.

2355
01:45:12,940 --> 01:45:17,940
He's talking about like what you eat.
What part of a person you're talking 

2356
01:45:17,940 --> 01:45:19,220
about a return,
this guy in who was eating street food,

2357
01:45:19,221 --> 01:45:24,221
like you bought some chicken skewers or 
something and it was human meat and he 

2358
01:45:24,221 --> 01:45:24,410
can tell because he's eating it so many 
times.

2359
01:45:24,500 --> 01:45:29,500
So he explained to the police,
this guy's like serving human food and 

2360
01:45:29,500 --> 01:45:32,420
you have him arrested and now the guy's 
like a crazy a evangelist.

2361
01:45:32,600 --> 01:45:34,690
And he like,
he like preaches and fellows.

2362
01:45:34,970 --> 01:45:37,520
He's killed thousands of people as the 
name of that documentary.

2363
01:45:37,700 --> 01:45:39,990
The vice guy to live barrier.
Yeah.

2364
01:45:39,991 --> 01:45:41,790
Texts that are twitter that a lot of 
people are asking me,

2365
01:45:41,850 --> 01:45:43,870
Jesus Christ,
I got gotta took that.

2366
01:45:44,370 --> 01:45:46,830
One of the craziest fucking things I've 
ever seen.

2367
01:45:47,510 --> 01:45:52,510
You know what's weird is that Obama's 
still struggles with his cigarette 

2368
01:45:52,510 --> 01:45:52,740
addiction.
You know,

2369
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:55,680
he's always talking about that.
How he just started back up and stuff,

2370
01:45:55,720 --> 01:46:00,720
right?
I'm going to post one of eight have 

2371
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:00,720
posted up on twitter right now.
There's,

2372
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:01,560
you,
you got to have to find them.

2373
01:46:01,830 --> 01:46:03,030
You know,
if you just,

2374
01:46:03,090 --> 01:46:04,920
it's the,
the site is very clunky.

2375
01:46:04,921 --> 01:46:08,100
The vice guide site,
these guys that put the site together,

2376
01:46:08,940 --> 01:46:10,900
it's um,
they,

2377
01:46:10,920 --> 01:46:13,050
they didn't do such a great job putting 
the site together,

2378
01:46:13,051 --> 01:46:15,660
but the,
but the footage is incredible,

2379
01:46:15,960 --> 01:46:16,760
you know,
I mean,

2380
01:46:16,850 --> 01:46:20,150
what they're doing is just amazing.
The stuff they're,

2381
01:46:20,151 --> 01:46:25,151
they're getting deep into this.
Like Liberia is like literally like a 

2382
01:46:25,991 --> 01:46:28,330
scene in a horror movie.
Like it's like a lot.

2383
01:46:28,360 --> 01:46:31,660
They went to a brothel in Liberia and 
it's just like saw.

2384
01:46:31,960 --> 01:46:32,950
I mean,
it literally is.

2385
01:46:32,951 --> 01:46:37,951
It's hostile.
It's insane and it's real and it's 

2386
01:46:37,951 --> 01:46:39,460
happening right now.
I'm posting it up on twitter right now.

2387
01:46:39,790 --> 01:46:41,830
This is the first one.
This is part one,

2388
01:46:47,670 --> 01:46:49,060
but it's you,
you,

2389
01:46:49,250 --> 01:46:51,960
you mean it really will change.
The apocalypse is here.

2390
01:46:52,260 --> 01:46:54,390
It just hasn't had America.
It's here.

2391
01:46:54,420 --> 01:46:57,960
It's in Mexico.
It's in Liberia,

2392
01:46:57,990 --> 01:47:00,210
it's in Haiti right now.
It's all over the fucking world.

2393
01:47:00,211 --> 01:47:02,700
There's big crazy shit is happening all 
over.

2394
01:47:02,701 --> 01:47:04,710
The world is not happening in America 
yet.

2395
01:47:05,250 --> 01:47:10,250
You look at how Liberia is,
that's going to change the way you look 

2396
01:47:10,250 --> 01:47:11,070
at everything.
And the fact that this could go on today

2397
01:47:11,220 --> 01:47:16,220
in 2010 and not even have it be like a 
subject like that that makes the 5:00

2398
01:47:16,771 --> 01:47:17,580
news,
you know,

2399
01:47:17,581 --> 01:47:20,850
that it's more important to find out 
some new girl that tiger woods fucked.

2400
01:47:21,100 --> 01:47:22,140
You know what I mean?
Really?

2401
01:47:22,230 --> 01:47:27,230
There's people in Liberia,
they're eating people on a regular 

2402
01:47:27,230 --> 01:47:27,230
basis.
It's,

2403
01:47:27,230 --> 01:47:28,620
it's,
it's fucking crazy.

2404
01:47:28,740 --> 01:47:30,390
Once you watch it's gonna.
If they show up,

2405
01:47:30,420 --> 01:47:33,120
they show a guy with the human heart.
They show a kid,

2406
01:47:33,121 --> 01:47:35,280
a young kid talking about,
oh,

2407
01:47:35,281 --> 01:47:37,110
that's the good meat.
That's the good beat.

2408
01:47:37,111 --> 01:47:39,450
The person pd talking about eating your 
enemies.

2409
01:47:40,550 --> 01:47:43,400
Whoa.
What the fuck man?

2410
01:47:44,480 --> 01:47:45,530
It's pretty heavy shit.

2411
01:47:50,490 --> 01:47:53,620
Mother fuckers at your home phone on 
vibrate.

2412
01:47:58,340 --> 01:48:00,990
Right?
What happened?

2413
01:48:04,610 --> 01:48:06,050
I Apologize,
Ladies and gentlemen.

2414
01:48:06,770 --> 01:48:09,720
My bad came.
I was going to ask you something to me.

2415
01:48:10,130 --> 01:48:10,880
Well,
you know what?

2416
01:48:10,881 --> 01:48:12,280
You see me everyday,
motherfucker.

2417
01:48:12,290 --> 01:48:14,790
Let's get some questions from these 
folks know me well.

2418
01:48:14,810 --> 01:48:17,090
I've been trying to ask you questions 
from these questions.

2419
01:48:17,150 --> 01:48:18,530
Okay,
let's go for some.

2420
01:48:18,531 --> 01:48:20,630
But in Africa when I was going to ask,
it's a fine line,

2421
01:48:20,631 --> 01:48:21,220
ladies,
gentlemen,

2422
01:48:21,230 --> 01:48:26,230
between letting the rant come out,
letting the ramble and I want to answer 

2423
01:48:26,230 --> 01:48:26,230
your questions,
but you know,

2424
01:48:26,230 --> 01:48:30,260
every now and then I got something a 
rant comes and I think for entertainment

2425
01:48:30,261 --> 01:48:35,261
purposes it's best to roll with it.
We got to stand hope lately I have not 

2426
01:48:35,261 --> 01:48:36,440
seen paranormal activity but I want to 
style.

2427
01:48:36,441 --> 01:48:41,170
But a while I started talking to him was
probably a couple of months ago.

2428
01:48:41,470 --> 01:48:43,410
He was telling me he was going to come 
to la.

2429
01:48:43,420 --> 01:48:44,980
We're going to try to schedule a 
crackle.

2430
01:48:47,510 --> 01:48:51,360
The show that never goes anywhere.
We have to do that soon man.

2431
01:48:51,870 --> 01:48:53,240
Let's get cracking.
Sign.

2432
01:48:53,390 --> 01:48:54,550
Seriously.
Crackle show.

2433
01:48:56,020 --> 01:48:57,860
Not Tell people we can't tell you what 
it is here.

2434
01:48:59,120 --> 01:49:01,970
Do you watch the Pakistan gun market on 
thing?

2435
01:49:01,971 --> 01:49:02,840
On Vice TV?
No.

2436
01:49:02,841 --> 01:49:05,450
I only thing I've seen on vice tv right 
now is that Liberia thing.

2437
01:49:05,451 --> 01:49:08,450
But that fucking do what those guys are 
doing is incredible.

2438
01:49:08,451 --> 01:49:10,910
And I've heard this all their videos are
incredible.

2439
01:49:11,240 --> 01:49:14,220
Vice Guide to Liberia and again I 
posted,

2440
01:49:14,230 --> 01:49:19,100
I just posted it on twitter,
but if you just go to vbs.tv,

2441
01:49:19,101 --> 01:49:21,500
that's their website and they have so 
much different shit there.

2442
01:49:21,501 --> 01:49:26,501
It's incredible.
These guys have giant cast iron balls.

2443
01:49:26,990 --> 01:49:31,990
I mean this dude drove to this fucking 
town in Liberia that's like this shanty 

2444
01:49:31,990 --> 01:49:35,060
town where there's no electricity.
There's no.

2445
01:49:35,061 --> 01:49:38,870
There's a piss and shit in the streets 
and this dude and a truck.

2446
01:49:38,871 --> 01:49:40,580
They drove in there and people started 
yelling,

2447
01:49:40,581 --> 01:49:42,050
give us money,
give us our money.

2448
01:49:42,300 --> 01:49:45,170
Like it's crazy.
They could have been hacked apart,

2449
01:49:45,171 --> 01:49:50,171
alive.
I mean literally it's like a scene in 

2450
01:49:50,171 --> 01:49:52,291
the Goddamn horror movie.
Oh my God.

2451
01:49:54,661 --> 01:49:56,870
Why?
The girl says from the video of champion

2452
01:49:56,871 --> 01:49:58,830
monkeys,
because you need to know,

2453
01:49:59,830 --> 01:50:00,900
need to know.
Goddammit.

2454
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:02,780
I need to know where that hair came 
from.

2455
01:50:02,900 --> 01:50:03,800
Things.
My cats here.

2456
01:50:04,150 --> 01:50:06,620
Hopefully sneaky bitch tastes like her 
hair.

2457
01:50:06,621 --> 01:50:10,590
I've had her hair in my mouth.
Um,

2458
01:50:12,650 --> 01:50:17,650
questions.
I didn't put up a website thing here on 

2459
01:50:19,251 --> 01:50:22,780
the message board and usually to do.
Maybe someone could.

2460
01:50:23,750 --> 01:50:25,550
Someone's asked questions in the message
board,

2461
01:50:28,130 --> 01:50:31,280
get Bravo Indian drunk on eastern.
No,

2462
01:50:31,610 --> 01:50:35,330
because this is my house.
The bronto does not.

2463
01:50:35,420 --> 01:50:40,420
He's not allowed to drink at my house.
When you have babies,

2464
01:50:40,530 --> 01:50:43,650
that's the first thing you want to cut 
out as Eddie being drunk in your house.

2465
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:49,480
The sharp corners and knives.
Worried about Eddie being drunk and 

2466
01:50:49,480 --> 01:50:49,480
you're out.

2467
01:50:50,570 --> 01:50:55,570
Just brought this girl sleeps in the 
baby room with a honey coming over.

2468
01:50:58,120 --> 01:51:01,970
I got this honeycomb and over can sleep 
in the crib to he dropped.

2469
01:51:02,030 --> 01:51:03,230
Okay.
What's the big deal?

2470
01:51:03,860 --> 01:51:08,390
I have a family man.
That's hilarious.

2471
01:51:10,870 --> 01:51:12,270
Bom,
Bom.

2472
01:51:14,880 --> 01:51:17,760
Mm.
Okay.

2473
01:51:18,440 --> 01:51:23,440
Answer a few more questions and we're 
going to leave soon because we've been 

2474
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:25,751
doing this for two hours and that's how 
we're going to keep doing it in the 

2475
01:51:25,751 --> 01:51:26,330
future.
What we've got to get all.

2476
01:51:26,360 --> 01:51:31,360
We got a bunch of one that we're going 
to figure out today how to get up on 

2477
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:31,970
itunes.
We record just the audio portion of it.

2478
01:51:33,790 --> 01:51:35,050
Any News on your website?

2479
01:51:35,790 --> 01:51:38,730
I got a crazy website designer who knows
what he's doing.

2480
01:51:38,790 --> 01:51:41,160
He's working on some crazy shit when it 
comes out.

2481
01:51:41,161 --> 01:51:44,220
It's going to be dubbed though,
so I'll leave it for now,

2482
01:51:44,460 --> 01:51:47,250
but in the meanwhile,
Brian may build a bridge.

2483
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:52,600
He may build a website to bridge us 
between this website in the future 

2484
01:51:52,600 --> 01:51:54,540
website because he's getting,
he's chomping at the bit.

2485
01:51:55,180 --> 01:51:56,100
So what's your,
um,

2486
01:51:56,130 --> 01:51:58,320
what is your review page?
Is it a,

2487
01:51:58,620 --> 01:52:00,550
what is your zero?
My space is at a.

2488
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:01,530
let's find Jesus.

2489
01:52:01,850 --> 01:52:03,670
Yeah,
they're all on red band dot Com.

2490
01:52:03,700 --> 01:52:08,700
Or if you just want to check out the 
video part of it because I have a 

2491
01:52:08,700 --> 01:52:08,700
written review and the regular video 
review,

2492
01:52:08,740 --> 01:52:12,640
but if you go to youtube backslash,
let's find Jesus.

2493
01:52:13,070 --> 01:52:15,340
Okay.
But then go to Red Ben Dot Com.

2494
01:52:16,170 --> 01:52:19,610
Red Ban r a r e D,
b a n.com.

2495
01:52:19,611 --> 01:52:24,611
Seriously,
if you ever want the best review of the 

2496
01:52:24,611 --> 01:52:25,040
droid I've ever seen as his review,
he breaks down.

2497
01:52:25,100 --> 01:52:28,220
I was talking about this today with 
customer service.

2498
01:52:28,221 --> 01:52:31,730
Like technology hasn't helped us in any 
way.

2499
01:52:31,731 --> 01:52:33,590
Trying to like when you're on the phone 
going no,

2500
01:52:33,591 --> 01:52:35,990
d like dog B,
like boy,

2501
01:52:36,610 --> 01:52:41,610
there's nothing that has been.
Has been invented to distinguished d's 

2502
01:52:41,610 --> 01:52:41,610
and B's.

2503
01:52:41,610 --> 01:52:41,610
Yeah.
Yeah.

2504
01:52:41,610 --> 01:52:45,040
You have to say a Beta Alpha P as in 
penis.

2505
01:52:45,320 --> 01:52:45,860
You always use

2506
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:47,690
words,
ideas as Dick.

2507
01:52:47,720 --> 01:52:48,440
I do.
I do.

2508
01:52:48,441 --> 01:52:51,140
This guy was getting really annoying and
I was trying to sign up for my,

2509
01:52:51,141 --> 01:52:52,670
uh,
my serious,

2510
01:52:52,700 --> 01:52:57,700
so I kept using swear words in Shit,
Diaz and Dick and it was like,

2511
01:52:57,741 --> 01:52:58,520
okay,
okay.

2512
01:52:58,521 --> 01:53:01,250
Okay.
I think it was like he was annoying me,

2513
01:53:01,251 --> 01:53:03,200
so I was like,
no,

2514
01:53:03,201 --> 01:53:05,720
he was annoying me.
That's hilarious.

2515
01:53:06,700 --> 01:53:09,010
It was just being so unhelpful.
Like what I was talking to him.

2516
01:53:09,011 --> 01:53:09,800
I'm like,
listen man,

2517
01:53:09,850 --> 01:53:13,080
I've been a customer for a long time,
like,

2518
01:53:13,100 --> 01:53:14,270
been awkward with me.
So,

2519
01:53:14,271 --> 01:53:19,271
uh,
I was holding off for them verizon 

2520
01:53:19,271 --> 01:53:21,821
iphone since that didn't come.
Should I go with the pre or what should 

2521
01:53:21,821 --> 01:53:21,821
I do?
Yeah,

2522
01:53:21,821 --> 01:53:23,060
I fucked us.
We thought that we were going to get the

2523
01:53:23,061 --> 01:53:24,350
uh,
Wednesday announcement.

2524
01:53:24,620 --> 01:53:25,790
Yeah,
it was gonna be a new,

2525
01:53:25,791 --> 01:53:30,791
um,
I'm going to check a look at the pre 

2526
01:53:30,791 --> 01:53:30,791
because like I said,
I like this for the phone,

2527
01:53:30,791 --> 01:53:32,250
but it's,
it's pretty much a,

2528
01:53:32,290 --> 01:53:32,810
you know,

2529
01:53:32,910 --> 01:53:34,280
you know,
the Prius has,

2530
01:53:34,600 --> 01:53:37,150
it has an option to be a,
my fireworks broadcast.

2531
01:53:37,151 --> 01:53:40,360
Verizon Network Rail and so if you get 
the,

2532
01:53:40,361 --> 01:53:41,610
the,
the IPAD,

2533
01:53:41,730 --> 01:53:44,460
you could broadcast verizon network and 
then connect it.

2534
01:53:45,240 --> 01:53:47,180
That's pretty bad ass.
I like the pre to.

2535
01:53:47,181 --> 01:53:52,181
I'd like to.
It seems to be as responsive as an 

2536
01:53:52,181 --> 01:53:55,581
iphone and it seems to be the only one 
that video they opened up 50 

2537
01:53:55,581 --> 01:53:58,761
applications at once.
You can't do that with his fucking 

2538
01:53:58,761 --> 01:53:59,310
clunky hunter shit.
This is like seriously.

2539
01:53:59,311 --> 01:54:03,240
This is like a dumb knockoff from a 
third world country and storm to.

2540
01:54:03,290 --> 01:54:05,310
Yeah.
Not even like you ever see those fake,

2541
01:54:05,350 --> 01:54:08,670
you know the storm to is.
Have you seen those fake iphone?

2542
01:54:08,950 --> 01:54:11,460
They make another countries that are 
just clunky ass shit.

2543
01:54:11,870 --> 01:54:13,350
You know that.
That's what this is like.

2544
01:54:13,351 --> 01:54:17,790
It's like it's so beyond.
It's so behind tor to come out yet.

2545
01:54:18,090 --> 01:54:19,920
Not yet.
That's what I want to get.

2546
01:54:19,950 --> 01:54:24,950
February third,
I believe that comes out of the Palm 

2547
01:54:24,950 --> 01:54:27,030
Prius because I liked the way the palm 
thing slides on the screen is way nicer.

2548
01:54:27,060 --> 01:54:32,060
I've always been a fan of palm and it 
looks like they got their shit together 

2549
01:54:32,060 --> 01:54:32,060
on this one.
Did you get your shit together?

2550
01:54:32,060 --> 01:54:32,800
I hated the last one.
We had,

2551
01:54:32,801 --> 01:54:35,430
remember we all had a trio,
several hundreds or whatever,

2552
01:54:35,640 --> 01:54:37,400
but we thought it was the shit when I 
first.

2553
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:39,880
Then it started freezing up all that 
time and we were like,

2554
01:54:42,020 --> 01:54:43,410
yeah,
I think I might get that.

2555
01:54:44,100 --> 01:54:49,100
Whoa.
Can we see in your book when it comes 

2556
01:54:49,100 --> 01:54:50,761
out?
Unfortunately I don't have any fucking 

2557
01:54:50,761 --> 01:54:50,761
pictures of when I was younger.
Not Very,

2558
01:54:50,761 --> 01:54:51,190
very,
very few,

2559
01:54:51,630 --> 01:54:53,420
but it was all about,
uh,

2560
01:54:53,550 --> 01:54:56,140
the road by doing standup.
When I first started out,

2561
01:54:56,141 --> 01:55:01,141
I just got a bunch of crazy stories that
I thought would be a good first book to 

2562
01:55:01,141 --> 01:55:01,141
write.
You know,

2563
01:55:01,141 --> 01:55:03,070
it's just,
it's basically just crazy road gigs,

2564
01:55:03,071 --> 01:55:04,990
like trying to make it as a standup 
comedian.

2565
01:55:04,991 --> 01:55:09,880
You don't realize how strange it is.
Like it's such a crazy life and it's,

2566
01:55:10,210 --> 01:55:12,940
you know,
you don't know what's going to happen.

2567
01:55:12,941 --> 01:55:14,470
You don't know where you're going.
It's the most,

2568
01:55:15,140 --> 01:55:18,340
it's the most unsure way to make a 
living,

2569
01:55:18,670 --> 01:55:20,530
to try to be a professional stand up 
comedian.

2570
01:55:21,490 --> 01:55:22,870
Pre is not all that.
I

2571
01:55:22,890 --> 01:55:25,120
can't open that many apps.
Why?

2572
01:55:25,210 --> 01:55:26,650
What are you talking about?
So what are you talking about?

2573
01:55:26,790 --> 01:55:28,620
There's a video of lost.
It's online.

2574
01:55:28,621 --> 01:55:31,470
Just go watch the old one.
You couldn't open up that many gaps,

2575
01:55:31,471 --> 01:55:35,130
but the pre plus as much more internal 
memory to be on top of it.

2576
01:55:35,131 --> 01:55:37,040
You had this conversation with Brian 
rankled.

2577
01:55:37,300 --> 01:55:42,300
The prepress can actually.
There's a video of somebody opening up 

2578
01:55:42,300 --> 01:55:43,090
50 apps at once and it's still playing 
need versus

2579
01:55:45,970 --> 01:55:50,970
hey,
you guys should put up a contest for 

2580
01:55:50,970 --> 01:55:52,561
people to be on your show.
Laziest stalker ever just to haul

2581
01:55:57,460 --> 01:55:59,370
Alex Jones.
Agent.

2582
01:55:59,730 --> 01:56:01,770
Yeah.
People always want to know that actually

2583
01:56:01,771 --> 01:56:03,870
he's Bill Hicks and if that's true,

2584
01:56:05,180 --> 01:56:10,180
Stan hope is in Austin today.
He should have stopped in to see Alex 

2585
01:56:10,180 --> 01:56:10,180
Jones.
Would they get along?

2586
01:56:10,180 --> 01:56:11,780
Yeah.
It's their friends and hope hoping.

2587
01:56:11,900 --> 01:56:13,490
Yeah.
Alex was friends with both of us.

2588
01:56:13,491 --> 01:56:16,110
We all talk about how crazy it is,
but.

2589
01:56:16,280 --> 01:56:19,560
But last time Alex Jones get on a stage 
or something like that.

2590
01:56:19,570 --> 01:56:20,760
Yeah,
that was.

2591
01:56:23,080 --> 01:56:24,020
Alex is crazy.

2592
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:26,130
He's a nice guy though.
His name

2593
01:56:26,970 --> 01:56:27,570
Alex.
Oh,

2594
01:56:27,571 --> 01:56:29,490
I love hanging out with the dude.
He's fun to hang out with.

2595
01:56:29,610 --> 01:56:33,270
But every time I ran with the guy,
I always feel bad for him because I feel

2596
01:56:33,271 --> 01:56:35,580
like I might just relaxing and calm 
down,

2597
01:56:35,800 --> 01:56:37,300
you know,
turn off strong.

2598
01:56:37,440 --> 01:56:38,220
He doesn't turn off

2599
01:56:38,310 --> 01:56:40,170
very high.
Strong father loves the UFC.

2600
01:56:42,420 --> 01:56:44,760
Whoever's doing mark cadens.
Not that funny.

2601
01:56:45,640 --> 01:56:47,170
Mr.
Angry Amadeus?

2602
01:56:50,070 --> 01:56:50,610
No.

2603
01:56:53,980 --> 01:56:55,430
The wash.
The state of the Union.

2604
01:56:55,431 --> 01:56:56,540
Any thoughts?
I didn't watch it.

2605
01:56:56,570 --> 01:56:59,180
Did you watch it?
What state of the Union?

2606
01:56:59,540 --> 01:57:01,100
Who Cares?
You know,

2607
01:57:01,101 --> 01:57:06,101
it's almost like at this point in time,
I thought that right before Obama got 

2608
01:57:06,101 --> 01:57:06,350
elected,
you know,

2609
01:57:06,351 --> 01:57:07,280
when,
when you know,

2610
01:57:07,310 --> 01:57:08,720
it looked like he was gonna win.
I was like,

2611
01:57:08,721 --> 01:57:09,830
wow,
this is so crazy.

2612
01:57:10,250 --> 01:57:12,040
This guy's gonna win.
Like this really,

2613
01:57:12,050 --> 01:57:13,790
really felt like things were gonna 
change.

2614
01:57:14,030 --> 01:57:15,170
You know?
It really felt like,

2615
01:57:15,171 --> 01:57:17,000
wow,
maybe voting is real.

2616
01:57:17,001 --> 01:57:18,660
You know,
this guy can get an office.

2617
01:57:18,661 --> 01:57:21,740
He's got a black guy from a single mom 
and you know,

2618
01:57:21,741 --> 01:57:26,741
in the way he says it's going to get 
everybody out of Afghanistan and get 

2619
01:57:26,741 --> 01:57:27,300
everybody out of Iraq.
And meanwhile he doesn't.

2620
01:57:27,770 --> 01:57:29,410
Well,
he also said when he was running like,

2621
01:57:29,420 --> 01:57:31,100
this is a long road.
You know,

2622
01:57:31,101 --> 01:57:33,620
I've got a lot of my room,
he never said it was going to be quick.

2623
01:57:33,621 --> 01:57:34,730
Like even when he was,
you know,

2624
01:57:34,850 --> 01:57:37,580
he's said this the whole time,
troops to Afghanistan,

2625
01:57:38,180 --> 01:57:38,600
you know,

2626
01:57:39,170 --> 01:57:41,060
I don't,
I'm not a military expert,

2627
01:57:41,061 --> 01:57:45,020
but will we have to look at for real is 
we have real problems at home.

2628
01:57:45,200 --> 01:57:48,140
We have real mean.
When you look at the enemy,

2629
01:57:48,170 --> 01:57:53,170
you look at attacks on America,
like there's this big giant distraction 

2630
01:57:53,170 --> 01:57:54,540
that the big fear it seems we have to 
worry about,

2631
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:56,990
worry about from other nations from all 
over the place.

2632
01:57:57,170 --> 01:58:02,170
There's a lot of crime and violence in 
America that America that we got to 

2633
01:58:02,170 --> 01:58:05,591
worry about before we worry about crime.
A giant group called the Taliban acting 

2634
01:58:06,831 --> 01:58:11,831
to kill Americans,
worried about the thousands of people 

2635
01:58:11,831 --> 01:58:12,830
that we kill every day and how the fuck 
do we put a stop to that shit?

2636
01:58:13,010 --> 01:58:16,100
How do we put a stop to senseless 
violent crime in America?

2637
01:58:16,101 --> 01:58:20,150
And then we got to deal with the fact 
that we're right next door to Mexico and

2638
01:58:20,151 --> 01:58:24,290
Mexico is way crazier than Iraq and 
Afghanistan combined.

2639
01:58:24,500 --> 01:58:27,260
More people get murdered in Mexico than 
anywhere in the world.

2640
01:58:27,380 --> 01:58:32,380
The war on drugs in Mexico.
There's five times more casualties this 

2641
01:58:32,450 --> 01:58:33,650
year.
Some something like that.

2642
01:58:33,651 --> 01:58:35,180
Victor Dobela,
the guy who does the,

2643
01:58:35,181 --> 01:58:36,220
um,
uh,

2644
01:58:36,250 --> 01:58:37,050
the,
the,

2645
01:58:37,120 --> 01:58:40,190
the Spanish version of my job for the 
UFC.

2646
01:58:40,700 --> 01:58:45,700
Great Guy.
He was living in Juarez and he told me 

2647
01:58:45,700 --> 01:58:45,700
it was some crazy statistic,
you'll have to google it,

2648
01:58:45,700 --> 01:58:50,640
but it was like five times more people 
died in the war as in one year then died

2649
01:58:51,341 --> 01:58:52,250
in the record.
To me,

2650
01:58:52,251 --> 01:58:54,230
it's not man,
they're,

2651
01:58:54,250 --> 01:58:57,040
they're just killing people left and 
right down there.

2652
01:58:57,041 --> 01:59:02,041
And the reason why they're doing it is 
because there's so much money and 

2653
01:59:02,041 --> 01:59:04,030
selling illegal drugs.
The United States from Mexico.

2654
01:59:04,360 --> 01:59:05,230
I mean,
it's incredible.

2655
01:59:05,231 --> 01:59:10,231
These guys get so God to enrich and 
they're fighting over so much that the 

2656
01:59:10,231 --> 01:59:13,240
violence is insane and they're killing 
police officers and politicians and they

2657
01:59:13,241 --> 01:59:18,241
brought over fucking tanks and shit and 
they got tanks running through the 

2658
01:59:18,241 --> 01:59:18,241
streets in Juarez.

2659
01:59:18,241 --> 01:59:22,320
I mean,
this shit is happening literally into a 

2660
01:59:22,320 --> 01:59:24,340
country that's connected to us.
You can fucking drive there.

2661
01:59:24,490 --> 01:59:27,610
It's not,
you don't have to fly halfway across the

2662
01:59:27,611 --> 01:59:30,510
world to deal with some conflict,
whereas the enemy is there.

2663
01:59:30,640 --> 01:59:33,820
The enemy is anybody who's murdering 
people.

2664
01:59:33,940 --> 01:59:36,160
Alright.
Anybody who's so fucking crazy,

2665
01:59:36,161 --> 01:59:38,560
they're killing five times more people 
than die in a war.

2666
01:59:38,680 --> 01:59:39,550
I mean,
it's right there.

2667
01:59:39,551 --> 01:59:44,551
That's a war.
There's a war that were not even 

2668
01:59:44,551 --> 01:59:44,551
involved.
It's connected to us.

2669
01:59:44,551 --> 01:59:47,910
It's fucking dangerous.
They're getting rich and shit and they 

2670
01:59:47,910 --> 01:59:48,970
have tanks and who knows what they're 
going to get.

2671
01:59:48,971 --> 01:59:50,730
I mean,
in Mexico you'd probably buy jets.

2672
01:59:50,740 --> 01:59:55,740
You know,
I could probably bicycling fucking US 

2673
01:59:55,740 --> 01:59:55,740
army jets from Russia.
Who the fuck knows?

2674
01:59:55,740 --> 01:59:57,360
They have billions and billions and 
billions of.

2675
01:59:58,080 --> 02:00:00,840
I mean they're so rich.
It's scary shit,

2676
02:00:00,841 --> 02:00:02,280
man.
Very scary shit.

2677
02:00:03,420 --> 02:00:05,170
Are worried about what's going on in 
Afghanistan,

2678
02:00:05,770 --> 02:00:07,600
but the problem is there's money in 
Afghanistan,

2679
02:00:07,601 --> 02:00:10,060
there's natural gas,
there's money in oil in Iraq,

2680
02:00:10,061 --> 02:00:12,460
there's oil controlling the natural gas 
pipeline.

2681
02:00:12,461 --> 02:00:17,461
The reason why people have been trying 
to get to Afghanistan over and over 

2682
02:00:17,461 --> 02:00:17,461
again for so many years with the Soviets
invaded them.

2683
02:00:17,461 --> 02:00:20,080
Why they're there.
They're trying to get the resources.

2684
02:00:20,170 --> 02:00:23,110
Whenever we fuck with other countries,
we're trying to get their resources.

2685
02:00:23,140 --> 02:00:25,660
That's it.
In the future of the electric cars,

2686
02:00:25,661 --> 02:00:28,780
do you think people are going to be like
blowing up radio shacks and like protect

2687
02:00:28,781 --> 02:00:30,710
the radio shack batteries.
Nevermind.

2688
02:00:32,130 --> 02:00:35,920
Get that one at all.
You didn't even get it.

2689
02:00:39,890 --> 02:00:41,240
The cartel isn't saying.
Yeah,

2690
02:00:41,241 --> 02:00:42,160
it is insane,
man.

2691
02:00:42,420 --> 02:00:43,910
It's scary shit.
Where do you get.

2692
02:00:43,930 --> 02:00:48,930
Can you get this gracie shirt for from.
I got it from a Gracie Jiu Jitsu 

2693
02:00:48,930 --> 02:00:49,550
website.
I'm not exactly sure what the name of it

2694
02:00:49,551 --> 02:00:50,920
is.
What it was that,

2695
02:00:50,980 --> 02:00:53,540
that bitch got cut.
That is.

2696
02:00:56,470 --> 02:00:57,200
Don't know.

2697
02:00:58,650 --> 02:00:59,400
Oh,
that's a girl.

2698
02:00:59,420 --> 02:01:01,680
So they beat her up while she was 
pregnant.

2699
02:01:02,670 --> 02:01:05,310
Is Steven Jackson like a football 
player?

2700
02:01:05,400 --> 02:01:10,400
Ex-Girlfriend House.
That's why she bears her results being 

2701
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:10,400
attacked.
Oh,

2702
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:12,180
attack at the hands of the NFL star.
Oh Shit.

2703
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:18,750
Damn.
Who knows?

2704
02:01:18,810 --> 02:01:22,280
She might be crazy.
The variable play quick live.

2705
02:01:22,281 --> 02:01:24,320
Yes I have.
It's fucking amazing.

2706
02:01:26,040 --> 02:01:29,280
Or La or la Orilla.
What does that mean exactly?

2707
02:01:29,850 --> 02:01:31,280
I don't know what that means.
Mexico.

2708
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:33,000
Mexico's guy says,

2709
02:01:34,550 --> 02:01:35,440
you know,
it's,

2710
02:01:35,450 --> 02:01:38,510
it's crazy that we have countries still.
I mean,

2711
02:01:38,511 --> 02:01:42,080
it's crazy lives like an area where if 
you're born over here,

2712
02:01:42,081 --> 02:01:44,930
you're fucked the shit out of luck.
We don't let you come to the good spot.

2713
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:47,150
It's not like just one planet that we 
all live on.

2714
02:01:47,390 --> 02:01:52,390
We like separated with guard the borders
and we have fucking guns and shit and 

2715
02:01:52,390 --> 02:01:52,390
they'll,
you know,

2716
02:01:52,390 --> 02:01:54,890
there's like a lot of stories about 
border patrol shooting people that are,

2717
02:01:55,160 --> 02:01:57,410
you know,
like holding a rock at 100 yards.

2718
02:01:57,830 --> 02:02:00,440
You can't hit them with a rock and 
headshot him.

2719
02:02:01,300 --> 02:02:04,390
He was threatening us like it's pretty 
nutty man.

2720
02:02:04,400 --> 02:02:05,960
Just because you're on the other side of
the fence.

2721
02:02:06,470 --> 02:02:08,810
It's such an uncompassionate thing,
you know,

2722
02:02:08,811 --> 02:02:09,920
the,
the whole idea of this,

2723
02:02:09,950 --> 02:02:11,390
these team rooms,
you know,

2724
02:02:11,420 --> 02:02:13,850
and not allow and everybody says,
well if you let them over,

2725
02:02:13,851 --> 02:02:18,851
they would just come over and a swarm 
and they would fuck up the whole 

2726
02:02:18,851 --> 02:02:18,851
culture.

2727
02:02:18,851 --> 02:02:22,400
Really within our theory here in La.
I mean,

2728
02:02:22,401 --> 02:02:27,401
how many illegals are there in la?
How much more would it be if it was 

2729
02:02:27,401 --> 02:02:27,830
legal here?
There's some white people.

2730
02:02:28,220 --> 02:02:30,080
Do you think everybody would just come 
over if they said,

2731
02:02:30,081 --> 02:02:31,730
okay,
now there's no immigration.

2732
02:02:31,731 --> 02:02:33,500
That's just one country.
The United States,

2733
02:02:33,501 --> 02:02:38,501
Canada and Mexico.
Everything that's attached is one 

2734
02:02:38,501 --> 02:02:38,501
country.
I think what happened,

2735
02:02:38,501 --> 02:02:39,950
I think they're just all come up.
There would be nobody in Mexico.

2736
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,650
Yeah.
You can get some bad ass deals on houses

2737
02:02:42,651 --> 02:02:47,651
in Mexico.
Then it will settle out over a few 

2738
02:02:47,651 --> 02:02:47,651
generations.
Shit,

2739
02:02:47,651 --> 02:02:51,430
you know,
people would realize like Baja 

2740
02:02:51,430 --> 02:02:51,430
California is pretty fucking the cost of
living here.

2741
02:02:51,430 --> 02:02:55,151
It's ridiculous.
I've been looking at loss lately now 

2742
02:02:55,151 --> 02:02:55,610
because I was at this party in the 
studio in a lock and it was amazing.

2743
02:02:55,611 --> 02:02:56,030
I was like,
oh,

2744
02:02:56,090 --> 02:03:01,090
that's perfect for people.
That has had a lot of shit now like 

2745
02:03:01,090 --> 02:03:01,090
last.

2746
02:03:01,090 --> 02:03:01,490
It's just a big room,
you know,

2747
02:03:01,491 --> 02:03:02,960
like it's,
it should be cheaper,

2748
02:03:03,200 --> 02:03:06,770
you know,
last start like going to $3,000

2749
02:03:06,771 --> 02:03:09,920
out here for just.
It's amazing how expensive laughs are.

2750
02:03:10,010 --> 02:03:11,800
Yeah.
No,

2751
02:03:11,870 --> 02:03:14,090
it is weird though.
Things are really expensive.

2752
02:03:14,150 --> 02:03:19,150
You know,
in cities like New York City apartments 

2753
02:03:19,150 --> 02:03:21,101
are the nuttiest things ever.
New York City apartments are assets 

2754
02:03:21,101 --> 02:03:24,180
retire.
You have to be like 3000 bucks for a 

2755
02:03:24,180 --> 02:03:26,201
little tiny place.
That's lot of people for that mean that 

2756
02:03:26,220 --> 02:03:29,960
it's impossible to be like a significant
percentage and people go,

2757
02:03:29,961 --> 02:03:30,430
well,
you know,

2758
02:03:30,440 --> 02:03:32,840
I don't have to have a car because I 
take the subway everywhere.

2759
02:03:33,110 --> 02:03:35,330
That's all well and good,
but then you don't feel trapped.

2760
02:03:35,340 --> 02:03:37,430
No.
You don't feel tethered to this machine.

2761
02:03:37,790 --> 02:03:39,950
You really want that.
God dammit.

2762
02:03:40,650 --> 02:03:42,820
Dammit.
The North American Union,

2763
02:03:42,821 --> 02:03:45,200
this gentleman says Pentair 33.
Yeah,

2764
02:03:45,201 --> 02:03:50,201
that's what it's supposed to be.
It's supposed to be a North American 

2765
02:03:50,201 --> 02:03:51,020
union is supposed to be this fucking 
crazy.

2766
02:03:51,350 --> 02:03:56,350
How would just describe it?
New World Order conspiracy that we're 

2767
02:03:56,350 --> 02:04:00,160
moving towards one world government and 
of how like in Europe they have the euro

2768
02:04:01,230 --> 02:04:06,230
that goes through one one money source 
that we're going to do that with the 

2769
02:04:06,230 --> 02:04:10,181
America and America and you know,
Lou Dobbs actually talked about it on 

2770
02:04:10,181 --> 02:04:12,020
CNN,
but Lou Dobbs might be crazy.

2771
02:04:12,350 --> 02:04:14,180
Obama was really interesting when you 
addressed it.

2772
02:04:14,181 --> 02:04:19,181
He addressed it during his campaigns,
so he sees no evidence for that and it 

2773
02:04:19,181 --> 02:04:23,531
makes you wonder like,
how much do you think they really know 

2774
02:04:23,531 --> 02:04:23,531
how much you think?
I mean,

2775
02:04:23,531 --> 02:04:27,491
who the fuck does Obama answer to?
What happens when you actually get an 

2776
02:04:27,491 --> 02:04:27,491
office?
A cat.

2777
02:04:28,590 --> 02:04:33,590
That's the secret.
There's this really smart cat golden 

2778
02:04:33,590 --> 02:04:35,090
head dress and it just sits there.

2779
02:04:35,510 --> 02:04:40,510
Obama,
you must don't make me turn you into 

2780
02:04:40,510 --> 02:04:40,510
salt,
bitch.

2781
02:04:40,510 --> 02:04:43,780
I mean,
what do you think happens when they get 

2782
02:04:43,780 --> 02:04:43,780
in there?
I mean,

2783
02:04:43,780 --> 02:04:48,291
do they meet with the heads of these 
gigantic corporation that spends 

2784
02:04:48,291 --> 02:04:49,200
millions of dollars on their campaign?
They must,

2785
02:04:49,350 --> 02:04:50,460
they must,
you know,

2786
02:04:50,580 --> 02:04:55,580
I mean that's one of the things that 
they said about Bush that Bush met with 

2787
02:04:55,580 --> 02:04:56,940
the heads of all these different energy 
companies,

2788
02:04:56,970 --> 02:05:00,390
oil companies and it's like common 
practice that like,

2789
02:05:00,910 --> 02:05:05,910
or it's common knowledge rather that a 
policy was dictated after he had these 

2790
02:05:05,910 --> 02:05:06,960
meetings.
Like they had worked it out,

2791
02:05:07,470 --> 02:05:09,810
but that's what I mean.
How does anybody not expect that?

2792
02:05:09,811 --> 02:05:12,860
If you pay people millions of dollars,
you'd give them millions of dollars,

2793
02:05:12,880 --> 02:05:17,880
your money to get them into office.
Once they're in office mean you bribe 

2794
02:05:17,880 --> 02:05:18,400
them,
mean you ride them.

2795
02:05:19,320 --> 02:05:24,120
Why would you spend millions of dollars?
I mean if you're an oil company,

2796
02:05:24,121 --> 02:05:24,310
why?

2797
02:05:24,310 --> 02:05:29,310
Why?
Why are you giving politicians all this 

2798
02:05:29,310 --> 02:05:31,221
money?
Because you want them to like take it 

2799
02:05:31,221 --> 02:05:31,221
easy on you.
You want to.

2800
02:05:31,221 --> 02:05:31,221
You bribing them.
It's nuts.

2801
02:05:31,221 --> 02:05:32,900
I mean it's,
it's crazy that that's legal.

2802
02:05:33,520 --> 02:05:38,520
It's great and the Supreme Court 
recently just stopped the cap on 

2803
02:05:38,520 --> 02:05:39,930
spending on it.
They said that they're like,

2804
02:05:40,080 --> 02:05:45,080
they treated them as an individual that 
are corporations like an individual so 

2805
02:05:45,080 --> 02:05:45,870
they could spend as much money on 
campaigns they want.

2806
02:05:45,900 --> 02:05:48,720
That's crazy.
They're going to have all kinds of nutty

2807
02:05:48,721 --> 02:05:51,720
as commercials like that talking dog 
commercial that they came up with.

2808
02:05:52,210 --> 02:05:57,210
Obama has a spending freeze though on on
a lot of the money last week.

2809
02:05:59,110 --> 02:06:00,360
I thought that was the whole thing.
I don't know.

2810
02:06:00,390 --> 02:06:04,800
He probably talked about it last night.
He was horrified by it.

2811
02:06:04,801 --> 02:06:09,801
I'm sure he was talking about it,
but I think that's also just because 

2812
02:06:09,801 --> 02:06:09,801
people were horrified by it.

2813
02:06:09,801 --> 02:06:12,150
I think they just got so greedy and 
horrific that they needed to take a step

2814
02:06:12,151 --> 02:06:13,080
back and go,
listen,

2815
02:06:13,110 --> 02:06:14,790
we fucked up.
This is like,

2816
02:06:14,791 --> 02:06:15,840
this is like,
you know,

2817
02:06:15,841 --> 02:06:17,670
people might store in the White House 
with guns.

2818
02:06:17,671 --> 02:06:19,140
This is getting crazy.
Like now,

2819
02:06:19,141 --> 02:06:24,141
you know,
even people that run the corporations 

2820
02:06:24,141 --> 02:06:24,141
are like,
really?

2821
02:06:24,141 --> 02:06:24,141
If they're gonna let us do this.
This is,

2822
02:06:24,141 --> 02:06:28,470
is this democracy?
Is this really with the United States 

2823
02:06:28,470 --> 02:06:30,471
was founded on Ustream.
This week doesn't seem like it's been 

2824
02:06:30,471 --> 02:06:30,471
fucking up as I've been fucking up at 
all.

2825
02:06:30,510 --> 02:06:32,550
No,
you stream looks fine this week.

2826
02:06:32,630 --> 02:06:34,260
Has Anybody have a problem with?
Um,

2827
02:06:34,320 --> 02:06:36,180
we were ready to jump ship you dirty 
bitch.

2828
02:06:36,200 --> 02:06:39,650
And it could have been the storm last 
week.

2829
02:06:39,651 --> 02:06:42,150
He could have been this,
you know,

2830
02:06:44,320 --> 02:06:47,700
Obama Obama did right after the budget's
got increased by 35 percent.

2831
02:06:47,701 --> 02:06:49,380
That's what this guy says.
Obama did.

2832
02:06:49,381 --> 02:06:50,550
What?
What was the question?

2833
02:06:51,120 --> 02:06:54,090
Was saying that Obama put a cap on the 
spending.

2834
02:06:54,930 --> 02:06:57,060
He did after the budget increased by 35 
percent.

2835
02:06:57,061 --> 02:07:02,061
So they increased it so they changed it,
but 35 percent and then he put a cap on 

2836
02:07:02,061 --> 02:07:06,051
it.
So it made it look like he was doing 

2837
02:07:06,051 --> 02:07:06,051
anything.
Something to stop it.

2838
02:07:06,051 --> 02:07:06,051
But really they didn't.
Is that what you're saying?

2839
02:07:07,160 --> 02:07:12,160
Well,
it seems like the spending freeze is in 

2840
02:07:12,160 --> 02:07:15,630
2011.
He said it's all fucking nuts and that's

2841
02:07:15,631 --> 02:07:17,280
why I don't follow this stupid.
It's,

2842
02:07:17,500 --> 02:07:18,270
it's,
it's,

2843
02:07:18,470 --> 02:07:23,470
it's so complex.
Politics are so complex that a certain 

2844
02:07:23,470 --> 02:07:25,050
point in time you have to like look at 
your resources.

2845
02:07:25,320 --> 02:07:30,320
You have to look at your life and go,
how much time do I have to deal with 

2846
02:07:30,320 --> 02:07:33,051
this shit?
How much time do I have to take care of 

2847
02:07:33,051 --> 02:07:33,660
my children to pay my bills,
to manage my career,

2848
02:07:33,661 --> 02:07:35,920
to go to the gym,
to hang out with my friends,

2849
02:07:35,921 --> 02:07:37,570
to play a couple games of pool?

2850
02:07:37,660 --> 02:07:40,210
How much fucking time do you have in a 
day?

2851
02:07:40,330 --> 02:07:43,870
And that's why they can just fuck you 
and keep fucking you.

2852
02:07:44,110 --> 02:07:49,110
That's why these cigarette and alcohol 
companies get away with contributing 

2853
02:07:49,110 --> 02:07:51,400
millions of dollars to a partnership for
a drug free America.

2854
02:07:51,730 --> 02:07:54,100
And then they make commercials like the 
one with the talking dog that,

2855
02:07:54,420 --> 02:07:56,170
you know,
tells the girl stopped smoking weed.

2856
02:07:56,890 --> 02:08:00,970
It's just corruption and it's blatant 
and it's right in front of our eyes.

2857
02:08:01,270 --> 02:08:01,690
I mean,
the,

2858
02:08:01,691 --> 02:08:06,691
the system is so fucked up that it's 
almost like someone else has to come in 

2859
02:08:06,791 --> 02:08:11,791
and fix it.
It's almost like we're like lord of the 

2860
02:08:11,791 --> 02:08:11,791
flies,
just a giant,

2861
02:08:11,791 --> 02:08:14,380
large scale version of it and we're just
fucking going crazy.

2862
02:08:14,710 --> 02:08:15,490
You know,
we're,

2863
02:08:15,491 --> 02:08:20,491
we're allowing corporations and these,
these dudes to make millions and 

2864
02:08:20,491 --> 02:08:21,760
millions of dollars just by fucking us.
The,

2865
02:08:21,860 --> 02:08:25,300
the,
all this stimulus money that went to all

2866
02:08:25,301 --> 02:08:27,400
these banks and they don't have to 
account for.

2867
02:08:27,610 --> 02:08:29,730
It's fucking chaos.
I mean,

2868
02:08:29,910 --> 02:08:33,340
that is a mad grab for cash where dudes 
are saying,

2869
02:08:33,341 --> 02:08:34,600
well,
we got to give them their bonuses.

2870
02:08:34,601 --> 02:08:36,070
We don't give them their bonuses.
They're gonna leave.

2871
02:08:36,130 --> 02:08:41,130
They're gonna leave.
So that's why they should get millions 

2872
02:08:41,130 --> 02:08:44,130
of dollars of taxpayers money while the 
whole economy melt in front of 

2873
02:08:44,130 --> 02:08:44,130
everybody's eyes.
Like,

2874
02:08:44,130 --> 02:08:47,170
that's incredible.
There's so bold that they're wanting,

2875
02:08:47,200 --> 02:08:52,200
they want bonuses while everything's 
falling apart and going under because 

2876
02:08:52,200 --> 02:08:52,200
they have contracts and then he said,
well,

2877
02:08:52,210 --> 02:08:57,210
we were going to lose them to other 
corporations like know what you're 

2878
02:08:57,210 --> 02:08:59,110
supposed to lose them.
You're fucking bank failed stupid.

2879
02:08:59,770 --> 02:09:00,970
Holy Shit.
I mean,

2880
02:09:00,971 --> 02:09:05,971
it's amazing how just blatant they are.
It's almost like it's so corrupt that 

2881
02:09:06,341 --> 02:09:11,341
nothing's going to fix it and I feel 
like when I think about investing my 

2882
02:09:11,341 --> 02:09:15,031
time and trying to pay attention to it 
or God for fucking been trying to do 

2883
02:09:15,031 --> 02:09:17,680
something to fix it,
it's like it's so fucked up.

2884
02:09:18,040 --> 02:09:23,040
It would take 100 lives of 100 people 
living in 100 lives just to bring it 

2885
02:09:23,040 --> 02:09:25,750
back to baseline,
just to bring it back to no corruption.

2886
02:09:26,310 --> 02:09:29,320
You know?
Politics in America are so fucked up and

2887
02:09:29,321 --> 02:09:32,740
corrupt and when I talked to people that
really know about it,

2888
02:09:32,741 --> 02:09:36,790
like I know some dudes who run some big 
businesses and I've talked to them about

2889
02:09:36,791 --> 02:09:41,791
politics,
about what real campaigns and what 

2890
02:09:41,791 --> 02:09:43,630
contributing is really all about.
It's fucking horrifying.

2891
02:09:43,960 --> 02:09:45,160
It's horrifying.
It's,

2892
02:09:45,370 --> 02:09:50,370
it should be all illegal.
It should be illegal for politicians to 

2893
02:09:50,370 --> 02:09:52,240
talk while someone else writes their 
speeches totally illegal.

2894
02:09:52,450 --> 02:09:57,450
There's no way you should be a guy 
reading a God damn script written by 20 

2895
02:09:57,450 --> 02:09:57,450
experts in,
in,

2896
02:09:57,450 --> 02:09:58,530
in English,
and in,

2897
02:09:58,680 --> 02:10:03,680
you know,
in the right way to phrase things and 

2898
02:10:03,680 --> 02:10:05,941
great writers who know how to mimic some
of the responses that people got to 

2899
02:10:05,941 --> 02:10:07,250
historical speeches,
you know,

2900
02:10:07,251 --> 02:10:07,930
like,
well,

2901
02:10:07,960 --> 02:10:09,760
Teddy Roosevelt was in a similar 
situation.

2902
02:10:09,761 --> 02:10:12,760
This is what he said and I think we need
to address that and the founding fathers

2903
02:10:12,761 --> 02:10:14,740
of this country really new passed.
We need to address that.

2904
02:10:14,741 --> 02:10:18,610
And they calculated so perfectly to make
you interesting.

2905
02:10:18,730 --> 02:10:20,560
We don't even know who the fuck Obama 
is.

2906
02:10:20,710 --> 02:10:23,290
We know that he's pretty cool,
calm and collected,

2907
02:10:23,291 --> 02:10:26,230
but you know,
until you see a dude,

2908
02:10:26,380 --> 02:10:30,380
you know that until we have.
Obama does,

2909
02:10:30,381 --> 02:10:31,450
where a lot.
I was on shit though.

2910
02:10:31,510 --> 02:10:33,070
You got to give them that,
but it's all.

2911
02:10:33,560 --> 02:10:33,980
Anyway.
If

2912
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:36,200
he was talking like that in your house,
you would think he's crazy.

2913
02:10:36,710 --> 02:10:41,600
What we need to do as a nation and as 
individuals,

2914
02:10:41,680 --> 02:10:43,880
you'd be like,
why can't you just talk to us?

2915
02:10:44,040 --> 02:10:45,830
Why?
Why do they have to talk like that?

2916
02:10:46,280 --> 02:10:48,350
Why can't they get onstage and go,
listen,

2917
02:10:48,770 --> 02:10:51,140
there's a certain age group that's 
almost dead,

2918
02:10:51,590 --> 02:10:53,550
but once they die,
I think we're going to be like,

2919
02:10:53,670 --> 02:10:56,680
I think so too.
I think it's just an age group that,

2920
02:10:56,910 --> 02:10:59,150
that if we didn't do that,
then people would be like,

2921
02:10:59,151 --> 02:10:59,930
what the fuck?
You know?

2922
02:10:59,960 --> 02:11:02,300
Maybe in 30 years the president's going 
to be like you are,

2923
02:11:02,301 --> 02:11:04,620
you know?
Yeah.

2924
02:11:04,730 --> 02:11:07,250
I think you've got a good point.
I think that's real possible in that age

2925
02:11:07,251 --> 02:11:08,930
group just got to go and once they're 
gone,

2926
02:11:08,931 --> 02:11:11,840
weed's going to be illegal.
Everybody before the Internet,

2927
02:11:11,870 --> 02:11:13,670
Pre Internet.
Oh my God.

2928
02:11:13,720 --> 02:11:15,410
You know,
if you didn't embrace the Internet,

2929
02:11:16,250 --> 02:11:17,120
God,
you're just,

2930
02:11:17,150 --> 02:11:19,220
you're,
you're riding on a buggy man.

2931
02:11:19,400 --> 02:11:22,600
You're riding on an animal.
You know all that.

2932
02:11:22,640 --> 02:11:23,660
That,
I mean,

2933
02:11:23,980 --> 02:11:28,980
can't we have a president that's,
that gets on stage and talks like a 

2934
02:11:28,980 --> 02:11:28,980
normal human.
He wraps.

2935
02:11:28,980 --> 02:11:32,180
This is the guy who gets on stage.
He goes,

2936
02:11:32,181 --> 02:11:33,020
well,
here's our situation.

2937
02:11:33,290 --> 02:11:38,290
You ever seen that guy ray kerr rate 
Kurt's will explain a technological 

2938
02:11:38,520 --> 02:11:41,170
singularity and the exponential increase
in technology.

2939
02:11:41,500 --> 02:11:43,340
The way he explains it as like a regular
dude.

2940
02:11:43,490 --> 02:11:47,660
He's not talking about it like it's the 
future.

2941
02:11:47,720 --> 02:11:52,720
God bless America and he's not.
He's not getting all crazy and dramatic 

2942
02:11:52,720 --> 02:11:54,770
and theatrical.
He's just giving you information,

2943
02:11:54,771 --> 02:11:59,771
but you could get.
Some people feel like they just have to 

2944
02:11:59,771 --> 02:11:59,771
do that.
Like Alex Jones even,

2945
02:11:59,771 --> 02:12:00,260
but that's.
It's a fake drama.

2946
02:12:00,261 --> 02:12:05,261
I don't mind real drama.
I don't mind if the guys talking and if 

2947
02:12:05,261 --> 02:12:05,261
he.

2948
02:12:05,261 --> 02:12:08,510
If I feel like he should have,
and you could tell that sincerity and 

2949
02:12:08,510 --> 02:12:10,280
that's one of the reasons why they put 
on that so obvious fake voice because it

2950
02:12:10,281 --> 02:12:15,281
masks insincerity.
That's what's the most offensive about 

2951
02:12:15,281 --> 02:12:16,580
politician speeches.
When if they had a talk,

2952
02:12:16,640 --> 02:12:18,230
if they had to go up there and go,
well,

2953
02:12:18,231 --> 02:12:20,900
what I want to do is I want,
first of all,

2954
02:12:20,901 --> 02:12:25,901
I want to end this war.
I'm trying to figure out how we've got 

2955
02:12:25,901 --> 02:12:25,901
to get out of Afghanistan.
First thing we're going to do.

2956
02:12:25,901 --> 02:12:30,851
It was going to set up Iraq,
we're going to get out of there and if 

2957
02:12:30,851 --> 02:12:31,490
he said it like a guy who was just 
talking to you,

2958
02:12:31,700 --> 02:12:33,980
you will be able to see where the 
bullshit is,

2959
02:12:34,220 --> 02:12:38,570
but by masking it in political speech,
in that speech,

2960
02:12:39,380 --> 02:12:43,130
that mode,
that space against predetermined pairs,

2961
02:12:43,131 --> 02:12:47,330
broadcasters and everyone,
we stand at a crossroads,

2962
02:12:47,450 --> 02:12:47,750
blah,
blah,

2963
02:12:47,751 --> 02:12:48,080
blah,
blah,

2964
02:12:48,170 --> 02:12:53,170
and when they talk like that,
it's agreed that it's going to sound 

2965
02:12:53,170 --> 02:12:54,200
like bullshit and it masks bullshit.

2966
02:12:55,760 --> 02:12:59,450
I just thought that up to newscasters.
Totally sweet that.

2967
02:12:59,451 --> 02:13:02,510
So I remember because that's a bit.
There's a bit in there somewhere,

2968
02:13:02,630 --> 02:13:03,450
right?
Yeah.

2969
02:13:04,480 --> 02:13:06,350
That's why they speak speeches like 
that.

2970
02:13:06,351 --> 02:13:11,351
Because you would.
If they were speaking like a regular 

2971
02:13:11,351 --> 02:13:11,351
person,
you another fellowship.

2972
02:13:11,351 --> 02:13:15,110
Why did the news people on radio 
stations have to do it because they're 

2973
02:13:15,110 --> 02:13:16,820
trying to get that paper pay.
Whatever you did,

2974
02:13:16,850 --> 02:13:18,800
there was a fire today.
Check this shit out.

2975
02:13:18,840 --> 02:13:21,140
We fill in this on main street.
Look at this building.

2976
02:13:21,170 --> 02:13:26,170
That's how fucked up check festival.
It's really hard for people to be 

2977
02:13:26,170 --> 02:13:26,180
themselves on camera.
It takes a long time.

2978
02:13:26,330 --> 02:13:27,710
Yeah,
but they train them to be that way.

2979
02:13:27,740 --> 02:13:32,740
They trained them to have that voice.
That's why the weather person and a 

2980
02:13:32,740 --> 02:13:32,740
traffic person in every city all sound 
the same.

2981
02:13:32,740 --> 02:13:36,260
In radio,
we have to have the certain data on main

2982
02:13:36,270 --> 02:13:41,270
street.
It looks like you got clear sailing on 

2983
02:13:41,270 --> 02:13:41,270
the floor.
Oh,

2984
02:13:41,270 --> 02:13:41,270
five.
Yeah.

2985
02:13:41,270 --> 02:13:42,840
They have a certain way of doing it 
because that's,

2986
02:13:43,040 --> 02:13:44,760
you know,
it's sort of like strip club djs too.

2987
02:13:44,761 --> 02:13:45,400
It's like,
yeah,

2988
02:13:45,480 --> 02:13:50,480
they're nervous so they fall into this 
pattern because it makes them more 

2989
02:13:50,480 --> 02:13:53,781
comfortable.
Some standup comedian sound like that 

2990
02:13:53,781 --> 02:13:53,781
too.
You know?

2991
02:13:53,781 --> 02:13:56,880
Some comedians like you can tell like 
they're trying to sound like a comic.

2992
02:13:57,020 --> 02:14:02,020
That was a big thing in the eighties.
There was a bunch of guys who weren't 

2993
02:14:02,020 --> 02:14:04,641
saying Jack Shit,
but they were saying it like comics and 

2994
02:14:04,641 --> 02:14:07,851
they would get laughs.
There's a few guys I want to mention 

2995
02:14:07,851 --> 02:14:07,851
names,
but a,

2996
02:14:07,851 --> 02:14:09,570
the eighties was real easy for shitty 
comedy.

2997
02:14:09,820 --> 02:14:14,820
There's a lot of guys like slipped 
through because it was so much comedy 

2998
02:14:14,820 --> 02:14:17,211
going on.
They never learned how to talk as 

2999
02:14:17,211 --> 02:14:19,671
themselves.
They're always like the wacky comedy 

3000
02:14:19,671 --> 02:14:21,531
voice guy.
It's your duty for 20.

3001
02:14:22,990 --> 02:14:23,680
Oh,
it's already going on.

3002
02:14:23,681 --> 02:14:26,530
For what time?
Is it a third time?

3003
02:14:28,370 --> 02:14:32,770
You guys ever talk about Michael 
Leonhard appointed the head of the dea?

3004
02:14:33,300 --> 02:14:34,360
No,
I don't know.

3005
02:14:34,390 --> 02:14:39,390
You know what it's like.
It's the same thing as like open up the 

3006
02:14:39,390 --> 02:14:39,390
doors to Mexico.
So I,

3007
02:14:39,390 --> 02:14:40,690
I,
I don't know the solution.

3008
02:14:40,780 --> 02:14:43,630
And the problem with the dea is really.
Yeah,

3009
02:14:43,631 --> 02:14:45,550
they shouldn't be busting people for 
pot.

3010
02:14:45,551 --> 02:14:50,551
Pot should be legal,
but there are some drugs that are 

3011
02:14:50,551 --> 02:14:50,551
fucking tab before you,
you know,

3012
02:14:50,551 --> 02:14:54,061
there's real drugs are terrible for you 
and a lot of our salt by fucking 

3013
02:14:54,061 --> 02:14:54,340
pharmacies.
All right.

3014
02:14:54,341 --> 02:14:56,380
How about Oxycontin?
You got real problems.

3015
02:14:56,500 --> 02:14:58,180
What's that thing we were talking about 
earlier?

3016
02:14:58,181 --> 02:15:01,510
The oxycontin express,
but these dea guys and all this,

3017
02:15:01,511 --> 02:15:03,070
they have families,
they have jobs,

3018
02:15:03,071 --> 02:15:05,230
you know,
and this is what they're doing and a lot

3019
02:15:05,231 --> 02:15:10,231
of them signed up to do the right thing 
to try to protect communities and then 

3020
02:15:10,231 --> 02:15:10,231
they get involved in it.

3021
02:15:10,231 --> 02:15:11,530
And I think that's when things get 
squirrely and you know,

3022
02:15:11,531 --> 02:15:12,850
you,
you do realize that yeah,

3023
02:15:12,851 --> 02:15:15,500
it is kind of fucking silly that I could
tell a guy can't do this,

3024
02:15:15,510 --> 02:15:20,510
I'm going to lock them in a cage.
And you think you're doing okay because 

3025
02:15:20,510 --> 02:15:20,510
you're just doing your job.
Well.

3026
02:15:20,510 --> 02:15:24,391
If they make pot legal fit,
that's 50 percent of the bulk of people 

3027
02:15:24,391 --> 02:15:25,480
are in prison for nonviolent drug 
offenses.

3028
02:15:25,481 --> 02:15:27,790
Do you just immediately cancel out all 
their other,

3029
02:15:27,840 --> 02:15:30,190
their,
their cases and let them out?

3030
02:15:30,191 --> 02:15:31,030
Or do you say?
No,

3031
02:15:31,120 --> 02:15:33,160
you live in the dark ages so you're 
fucked.

3032
02:15:33,200 --> 02:15:38,200
You know,
you lived in the ages when it was 

3033
02:15:38,200 --> 02:15:39,631
illegal.
I mean you'd have to let everybody out 

3034
02:15:39,631 --> 02:15:41,071
of jail.
He'd have to let like half the people 

3035
02:15:41,071 --> 02:15:41,170
out of jail.
Well that's,

3036
02:15:41,260 --> 02:15:43,280
that's crazy.
They're all fucked up now.

3037
02:15:43,281 --> 02:15:45,070
They've been in jail and they're all 
harden.

3038
02:15:45,110 --> 02:15:50,110
Had been there for five years and 
they're fucking angry unless you're 

3039
02:15:50,110 --> 02:15:50,110
going to pay him how you gonna let him 
out of jail.

3040
02:15:50,110 --> 02:15:51,110
You're going to give them millions of 
dollars.

3041
02:15:51,380 --> 02:15:52,850
They've got all sue.
Okay?

3042
02:15:52,910 --> 02:15:55,820
So now you got millions of people who 
want millions of dollars.

3043
02:15:55,821 --> 02:16:00,821
You don't think the economist.
Fuck now let people that make pot 

3044
02:16:00,821 --> 02:16:03,941
illegal or make pot legal.
Let people out of jail make the dea 

3045
02:16:03,941 --> 02:16:04,550
closed down because you're not going to 
go after drugs.

3046
02:16:05,480 --> 02:16:10,480
Fuck.
It's like the web we have already woven 

3047
02:16:10,480 --> 02:16:13,010
is so polluted.
It's so hard to.

3048
02:16:13,250 --> 02:16:15,200
To extract yourself from it.
Is that the right word?

3049
02:16:15,201 --> 02:16:20,201
I'm trying to be smart to be immaculate 
with my structure of my linguistics.

3050
02:16:24,680 --> 02:16:27,550
You're doing the fake speech thing.
Speech thing.

3051
02:16:30,130 --> 02:16:31,960
What's the sickest thing you've ever 
seen?

3052
02:16:32,110 --> 02:16:35,050
You brother?
What does that mean?

3053
02:16:35,060 --> 02:16:36,400
What is the sickest thing I've ever 
seen?

3054
02:16:36,401 --> 02:16:41,401
I've seen some tech sick things.
Have you been at the Ronald Reagan 

3055
02:16:41,401 --> 02:16:41,401
Museum here in California?
Um,

3056
02:16:41,890 --> 02:16:43,660
no I haven't.
And she'd go pretty crazy.

3057
02:16:43,900 --> 02:16:45,880
Really baked and go see her crazy.
The people,

3058
02:16:45,881 --> 02:16:50,881
like when I was a kid,
Ronald Reagan was a hated man when 

3059
02:16:50,881 --> 02:16:50,881
really can't.
Yeah.

3060
02:16:50,881 --> 02:16:52,960
Because people have convenient memories.
When I was a kid,

3061
02:16:53,020 --> 02:16:55,150
amongst anybody who's intelligent,
I lived in Boston,

3062
02:16:55,151 --> 02:16:58,210
which is a fairly liberal,
very intelligent town.

3063
02:16:58,240 --> 02:16:58,960
Very,
you know,

3064
02:16:59,110 --> 02:17:00,830
high amount of ecologists per capita 
people,

3065
02:17:00,860 --> 02:17:03,250
Pretty God damn smart and Boston and 
growing up there.

3066
02:17:03,250 --> 02:17:08,250
They hated Ronald Reagan were all that 
Iran Contra Shit was going on and they 

3067
02:17:08,250 --> 02:17:09,030
made Reagan testify about selling Oliver
North.

3068
02:17:09,220 --> 02:17:10,750
I can't recall.
You know,

3069
02:17:10,760 --> 02:17:13,030
when it was salt the arms to Iran?
I can't recall.

3070
02:17:13,031 --> 02:17:14,080
I don't recall.
You don't recall.

3071
02:17:14,081 --> 02:17:15,910
Let me eat whatever the fuck you talking
about.

3072
02:17:16,220 --> 02:17:17,860
He just sit up there and say,
I don't remember.

3073
02:17:17,861 --> 02:17:21,100
That means you did you fuck you fucking 
criminal.

3074
02:17:21,130 --> 02:17:25,190
That guy's a criminal.
I mean that guy was your old.

3075
02:17:25,240 --> 02:17:27,160
Tell him you don't remember.
I can't recall.

3076
02:17:27,380 --> 02:17:29,150
That's crazy.
There's a do Nima.

3077
02:17:29,200 --> 02:17:34,200
Jimmy tingle.
It was a hilarious Boston comedian who 

3078
02:17:34,200 --> 02:17:34,200
had a great joke about that.
He goes,

3079
02:17:34,200 --> 02:17:35,080
if you.
Here's a tip,

3080
02:17:35,081 --> 02:17:39,430
Mr Reagan,
if you sell ams to people who hate us,

3081
02:17:40,470 --> 02:17:42,450
jot it down.
He goes,

3082
02:17:42,490 --> 02:17:46,000
make a little note.
Put on your refrigerator today.

3083
02:17:46,001 --> 02:17:48,190
I sold homes to people who hate us.

3084
02:17:51,100 --> 02:17:53,570
No,
you fucking felt these savages.

3085
02:17:54,840 --> 02:17:56,620
I think we're going to end this because,
uh,

3086
02:17:56,670 --> 02:17:59,220
we don't want to overstay our welcome 
for your 4,000,

3087
02:17:59,290 --> 02:18:01,290
the perfect 4,001
viewers,

3088
02:18:01,410 --> 02:18:02,510
listeners,
uh,

3089
02:18:02,620 --> 02:18:04,950
you guys are super cool.
Thank you very much for tuning in.

3090
02:18:05,040 --> 02:18:07,070
We will continue this every week.
This is,

3091
02:18:07,290 --> 02:18:10,080
I believe five weeks in a row and you 
can always get them.

3092
02:18:10,081 --> 02:18:15,081
You can always download them off this 
huge stream channel and we are going to 

3093
02:18:15,081 --> 02:18:15,081
look into today how to,
what,

3094
02:18:15,081 --> 02:18:16,800
how the fuck would get everything on 
itunes.

3095
02:18:17,010 --> 02:18:22,010
And then eventually what I would like to
do is I would like to do two of these a 

3096
02:18:22,010 --> 02:18:25,640
week,
maybe one video and we'll do that and 

3097
02:18:25,640 --> 02:18:26,850
put it might do one just straight audio.
I'm thinking tool.

3098
02:18:26,851 --> 02:18:31,851
We could be better than one.
I don't want to do it like a regular 

3099
02:18:31,851 --> 02:18:34,041
thing and habits so that you can rss it 
and subscribe to it and get it 

3100
02:18:34,041 --> 02:18:34,740
automatically downloaded to your itunes 
and all that jazz.

3101
02:18:34,860 --> 02:18:37,320
Fuck Flash.
So that's what we're doing.

3102
02:18:37,800 --> 02:18:38,930
Dog.
You had Brian.

3103
02:18:39,900 --> 02:18:41,520
It's not worth it.
He knows what he's doing.

3104
02:18:42,210 --> 02:18:43,170
Use Flash,
Brian,

3105
02:18:43,171 --> 02:18:45,920
you scumbag things are getting crazy.
Alright,

3106
02:18:45,960 --> 02:18:47,940
thank you very much guys.
We really appreciate it.

3107
02:18:47,941 --> 02:18:49,780
And uh,
we'll see you next week later.

3108
02:18:49,790 --> 02:18:51,690
Yo.
Oh yeah,

3109
02:18:51,691 --> 02:18:52,710
I'm doing this right.

3110
02:19:22,950 --> 02:19:25,260
The people are still here.
Ladies and gentlemen,

3111
02:19:25,261 --> 02:19:28,070
we will now broadcast only an audio.
This is

3112
02:19:28,070 --> 02:19:33,070
the secret session that nobody told 
anybody about that because you decided 

3113
02:19:33,070 --> 02:19:35,360
to stick around and keep your fucking 
ustream open.

3114
02:19:37,530 --> 02:19:42,530
You're here,
ladies and gentlemen,

3115
02:19:43,730 --> 02:19:45,650
we're going to keep this bumping.
Let's fuck.

3116
02:19:45,940 --> 02:19:46,820
We're gonna.
We're gonna.

3117
02:19:46,821 --> 02:19:51,821
Fuck my cat.
And we're going to talk for another 20 

3118
02:19:51,821 --> 02:19:51,821
minutes folks.
Why?

3119
02:19:51,821 --> 02:19:56,260
Because this is a God damn experiment.
I want to see how many people stay on 

3120
02:19:56,260 --> 02:19:59,210
people to see how many people listen to 
us with just a,

3121
02:19:59,480 --> 02:20:03,680
just a backbeat and Brian making cat 
noises.

3122
02:20:03,890 --> 02:20:05,540
We're down to three.
Oh nine folks.

3123
02:20:05,780 --> 02:20:07,940
It's not looking so good with losing 
viewers.

3124
02:20:08,450 --> 02:20:11,010
I think we do our best work in the,
um,

3125
02:20:11,570 --> 02:20:12,780
post anyway.
You know,

3126
02:20:12,800 --> 02:20:15,230
people don't have to watch it live to be
honest.

3127
02:20:15,231 --> 02:20:17,270
We're not answering questions.
Okay.

3128
02:20:17,630 --> 02:20:20,760
Questions are coming in like a waterfall
and we're trying to keep up with.

3129
02:20:20,810 --> 02:20:23,450
What's most important is that we give 
you the flow.

3130
02:20:23,451 --> 02:20:24,980
You know what I'm saying?
We can be the rant.

3131
02:20:25,010 --> 02:20:26,980
We talked to you.
We can dictate what are.

3132
02:20:28,660 --> 02:20:30,430
What's going on.
Committed.

3133
02:20:30,530 --> 02:20:32,780
I'm committed to you.
My friend Adam.

3134
02:20:33,540 --> 02:20:38,540
We are committed to Jesus in space.
I'm as high as Paula Abdul is on the 

3135
02:20:40,841 --> 02:20:42,310
ride home from the pharmacy.

3136
02:20:46,660 --> 02:20:47,760
Alright,
you guys are still here.

3137
02:20:47,761 --> 02:20:48,330
We've got three.
Oh,

3138
02:20:48,331 --> 02:20:50,010
three bitches.
We lost.

3139
02:20:50,350 --> 02:20:52,020
We lost people with itchy trigger 
fingers.

3140
02:20:52,080 --> 02:20:57,080
It's like when you go to and sometimes 
you go to the movies and these stop sit 

3141
02:20:57,080 --> 02:20:58,460
through the credits,
but there's some funny shit next credits

3142
02:20:58,461 --> 02:21:03,461
like bachelor the bachelor or the 
Bachelor party that's just called Fast 

3143
02:21:03,800 --> 02:21:05,550
Bachelor party.
That fucking movies.

3144
02:21:05,590 --> 02:21:06,830
Alpha nachis moving.
No,

3145
02:21:06,850 --> 02:21:08,000
no.
It's a hangover.

3146
02:21:08,120 --> 02:21:09,970
Hangover.
The hanger talking Seventies.

3147
02:21:10,250 --> 02:21:15,250
Jesus.
I don't even know what I'm talking 

3148
02:21:15,250 --> 02:21:15,250
about.
I was about a bachelor parties.

3149
02:21:15,250 --> 02:21:15,250
The hangover,
my apologies.

3150
02:21:15,250 --> 02:21:17,270
That Galifianakis movie.
The fucking.

3151
02:21:17,400 --> 02:21:20,150
The end credits or some of the funniest 
shit.

3152
02:21:20,540 --> 02:21:21,380
I mean,
it's really,

3153
02:21:21,381 --> 02:21:23,180
really hilarious.
Hilarious stuff.

3154
02:21:23,990 --> 02:21:26,300
So that's what this is.
This is the end credits.

3155
02:21:26,330 --> 02:21:26,690
Three.
Oh,

3156
02:21:26,691 --> 02:21:27,110
five,
three.

3157
02:21:27,111 --> 02:21:28,250
Oh six.
We're gaining.

3158
02:21:28,490 --> 02:21:30,560
Maybe it's a gentleman.
Spread the word.

3159
02:21:30,740 --> 02:21:35,740
Let bitches know this visual,
but there is a funky beat and they 

3160
02:21:35,740 --> 02:21:37,970
asked,
still talking and this guy says,

3161
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:38,680
I'm on here.

3162
02:21:38,700 --> 02:21:40,770
Twenty four slash seven.
I don't sleep.

3163
02:21:41,260 --> 02:21:43,540
Wow.
Ernie,

3164
02:21:44,980 --> 02:21:49,630
Ernie,
Ernie am slander in wild man.

3165
02:21:49,960 --> 02:21:51,550
Pet my cat for me.
Listen,

3166
02:21:51,970 --> 02:21:55,770
I can't want to want to put my cat.
You fucking Weirdo can't for you.

3167
02:21:55,960 --> 02:21:57,860
I pet my cat from her.
Okay.

3168
02:21:58,920 --> 02:22:01,150
You like a Funky beat?
Yeah.

3169
02:22:01,151 --> 02:22:06,151
I liked that music man.
This guy says I like radio better than 

3170
02:22:06,221 --> 02:22:07,120
video.
Personally.

3171
02:22:07,130 --> 02:22:08,860
Imagination.
I agree with you.

3172
02:22:08,861 --> 02:22:11,830
I think there is something about that.
I like listening to the radio too,

3173
02:22:11,831 --> 02:22:16,831
man.
I love satellite radio for that very 

3174
02:22:16,831 --> 02:22:16,831
reason.
You know,

3175
02:22:16,831 --> 02:22:18,440
satellite radio is the shit but this is 
basically satellite radio for everyday.

3176
02:22:18,730 --> 02:22:20,530
I don't even have to pay for it,
you know?

3177
02:22:20,560 --> 02:22:24,370
I mean I think satellite radio is 
awesome and I have in my car,

3178
02:22:24,371 --> 02:22:29,371
I have a serious with the best of Xm so 
I can get Howard stern and I get opie 

3179
02:22:29,371 --> 02:22:30,900
and Anthony and I get bubba the love 
sponge and I can get,

3180
02:22:30,901 --> 02:22:35,901
you know,
Ron Affairs and I can get potus 

3181
02:22:35,901 --> 02:22:35,901
politics.

3182
02:22:35,901 --> 02:22:35,901
I can get anything.
It's fucking awesome.

3183
02:22:35,901 --> 02:22:37,830
I love it.
So because of that,

3184
02:22:37,860 --> 02:22:39,030
um,
you know,

3185
02:22:39,660 --> 02:22:42,150
I think,
I think what this is though,

3186
02:22:42,210 --> 02:22:47,210
what this is,
is even more exciting because this is 

3187
02:22:47,210 --> 02:22:47,760
like radio than anybody can do.
I mean Brian and I are just sitting here

3188
02:22:47,761 --> 02:22:51,450
in my living room and we got this 
fucking microphone that we bought at the

3189
02:22:51,451 --> 02:22:53,850
Mac store and this is connected to our 
laptops.

3190
02:22:53,851 --> 02:22:55,080
I mean,
so Goddam easy.

3191
02:22:55,081 --> 02:23:00,081
We don't have a crew and you know,
I mean if we were charging you guys a 

3192
02:23:00,081 --> 02:23:00,650
lot of money and we'd had,
you know,

3193
02:23:00,660 --> 02:23:02,790
we wanted to have some sort of a 
production value to this thing.

3194
02:23:02,791 --> 02:23:03,870
Yeah,
I can understand that.

3195
02:23:03,871 --> 02:23:08,871
But is that,
does that make it any better when you 

3196
02:23:08,871 --> 02:23:09,300
watch the tonight show?
So you really give a fuck that there's a

3197
02:23:09,301 --> 02:23:12,410
room full of people there and 
everybody's cheering and do you read?

3198
02:23:12,411 --> 02:23:14,070
You really give a fuck?
There's a band.

3199
02:23:14,071 --> 02:23:17,340
They're playing wack ass music.
The at the intros and Outros.

3200
02:23:17,550 --> 02:23:22,550
I mean when I,
what I like about like if I watched 

3201
02:23:22,550 --> 02:23:25,271
Letterman,
I like letterman interacting with 

3202
02:23:25,271 --> 02:23:25,271
people.
He's funny.

3203
02:23:25,271 --> 02:23:25,271
He's a fucking funny guy.
That's what I like.

3204
02:23:25,350 --> 02:23:28,230
He could be doing that in his house and 
it would be just as interesting.

3205
02:23:29,070 --> 02:23:30,390
What are you doing?
You're showing people pictures.

3206
02:23:33,150 --> 02:23:35,670
Going to Duncan trussell's facebook 
page.

3207
02:23:36,580 --> 02:23:39,130
Tonight is Thursday.
Comedy is dead to Django.

3208
02:23:39,640 --> 02:23:41,880
Not a good comment.
Got a hot date with the wife.

3209
02:23:42,160 --> 02:23:43,690
I had a good comics.
Take her to it.

3210
02:23:44,430 --> 02:23:45,370
Um,
no.

3211
02:23:46,580 --> 02:23:49,500
I don't want to poison my,
my future baby with.

3212
02:23:49,740 --> 02:23:50,760
Oh,
that a good lineup.

3213
02:23:51,030 --> 02:23:51,850
Damn.
Doug Benson,

3214
02:23:52,240 --> 02:23:53,610
Dana Gould,
Chris Hardwick.

3215
02:23:53,820 --> 02:23:54,870
Nick,

3216
02:23:54,990 --> 02:23:59,990
Nick Kroll guy.
Branum Duncan trussell and Natasha 

3217
02:23:59,990 --> 02:24:01,110
Leggero.
That's a good guy.

3218
02:24:01,710 --> 02:24:03,510
Yeah.
Duncan puts on a good show.

3219
02:24:03,511 --> 02:24:07,830
That's that one that he does from the 
funeral and cemetery tonight.

3220
02:24:07,860 --> 02:24:08,910
That's nutty.
AP.

3221
02:24:08,950 --> 02:24:10,280
We're promo and people.
Man.

3222
02:24:11,370 --> 02:24:16,370
You know what I'm saying?
Like we've got an allegiance to our 

3223
02:24:16,370 --> 02:24:16,680
friends,
but I came out that here's your $2.

3224
02:24:16,710 --> 02:24:19,410
You guys are fagging out now that 
there's no video,

3225
02:24:19,411 --> 02:24:21,180
right?
Listen Fella,

3226
02:24:21,480 --> 02:24:26,480
just because you have to use your 
imagination to masturbate to the sound 

3227
02:24:26,480 --> 02:24:30,831
of my voice now and you can't see our 
pretty faces doesn't mean we're fagging 

3228
02:24:30,831 --> 02:24:31,830
out because there's no video.

3229
02:24:32,010 --> 02:24:35,010
We're experimenting my friend.
How weird is that?

3230
02:24:35,160 --> 02:24:38,520
You guys are fagging out now or are you 
meaning that we're fagging out like,

3231
02:24:38,540 --> 02:24:40,660
like Brian Sucking my cock right now 
when he's talking.

3232
02:24:41,690 --> 02:24:44,220
No,
that's not what's going on at all.

3233
02:24:44,370 --> 02:24:46,110
I'll let you see a little video real 
quick.

3234
02:24:46,111 --> 02:24:48,240
As long as you promise to stop being 
mean.

3235
02:24:48,700 --> 02:24:52,950
Promise no stopping me and I'll let you 
see a little more video.

3236
02:24:53,850 --> 02:24:56,160
Fuck you.
This is radio bitch.

3237
02:24:56,490 --> 02:24:59,580
This is the youth stream radio portion 
of the program.

3238
02:24:59,581 --> 02:25:01,430
We're down to 300 viewers.
Latest gentlemen.

3239
02:25:01,930 --> 02:25:05,520
A lot of people don't like the whole 
imagination thing down with it.

3240
02:25:05,760 --> 02:25:06,240
Like,
listen,

3241
02:25:06,241 --> 02:25:09,300
stupid.
I want to see you get out of here.

3242
02:25:09,580 --> 02:25:11,100
This guy says it was a joke,
Joe.

3243
02:25:11,101 --> 02:25:13,020
I know it was a joke.
I was joking back.

3244
02:25:13,021 --> 02:25:15,990
My friend Andrew Lawrence.
I'm just being silly.

3245
02:25:16,740 --> 02:25:18,270
I know.
That's the problem,

3246
02:25:18,271 --> 02:25:18,780
man.
You know?

3247
02:25:18,781 --> 02:25:21,060
You know you don't know me.
You listen to me talk shit.

3248
02:25:21,061 --> 02:25:24,370
I'm an Avatar is horrible.
How dare you.

3249
02:25:24,580 --> 02:25:27,040
How dare you.
Irish temper 69.

3250
02:25:27,160 --> 02:25:29,980
First of all,
anybody that has a 69 and their name.

3251
02:25:29,990 --> 02:25:34,000
I'll have to think about your opinion 
and go one of two.

3252
02:25:34,030 --> 02:25:36,490
Why was cocksucking looking at below 
jobs?

3253
02:25:36,491 --> 02:25:37,900
There's nothing in front of me

3254
02:25:38,100 --> 02:25:40,890
going to be harder than this.
Turned to a gay off.

3255
02:25:42,610 --> 02:25:43,490
Listen man,
you're.

3256
02:25:43,860 --> 02:25:47,880
Unless you're 12 years old,
don't have 69 at the end of your name.

3257
02:25:48,180 --> 02:25:51,510
And if you are 12 years old and I'm 69 
at the end of your name,

3258
02:25:52,050 --> 02:25:54,750
who touched you?
Who did that to you?

3259
02:25:56,310 --> 02:25:58,380
Or do you just trying to be silly?
You're just trying to be silly.

3260
02:25:58,860 --> 02:25:59,490
Irish temper.

3261
02:25:59,530 --> 02:26:03,240
I got an Irish temper and I have my 
degree yet complete.

3262
02:26:08,490 --> 02:26:09,090
Alright,
I'm gonna.

3263
02:26:09,091 --> 02:26:09,550
Turn this off.

3264
02:26:10,820 --> 02:26:14,530
I won't be happy unless you call me 
Aaron instead of earning.

3265
02:26:14,640 --> 02:26:17,600
Oh my apologies.
I did not mean that.

3266
02:26:18,230 --> 02:26:20,240
Aaron.
Aaron,

3267
02:26:21,150 --> 02:26:23,030
them slender.
That's what it is.

3268
02:26:23,120 --> 02:26:25,720
I'm sorry.
It's a checklist.

3269
02:26:25,730 --> 02:26:27,380
And Gentlemen,
women are very sensitive.

3270
02:26:27,410 --> 02:26:29,240
They have to be.
They raise babies.

3271
02:26:29,780 --> 02:26:34,780
Okay.
You don't realize that until you have a 

3272
02:26:34,780 --> 02:26:34,780
few,
like,

3273
02:26:34,780 --> 02:26:34,820
oh,
now I know why they're like that because

3274
02:26:35,030 --> 02:26:37,830
I'm not milking any fucking baby.
You know what I'm saying?

3275
02:26:38,220 --> 02:26:43,220
You need the softer personality.
Brian and Brian Understanding you're 

3276
02:26:43,220 --> 02:26:43,220
trying to have a baby.
Is this true?

3277
02:26:43,310 --> 02:26:44,510
Yes.
Uh,

3278
02:26:44,840 --> 02:26:49,840
I'm joining a pregnancy pack where me 
and my guy friends were all getting 

3279
02:26:49,840 --> 02:26:53,450
together and there's this place in 
Pennsylvania with these girls that don't

3280
02:26:53,451 --> 02:26:57,770
want to have babies in highschool.
Put that away.

3281
02:26:58,610 --> 02:27:01,160
I don't want to watch this chicken a 
fucking foot job.

3282
02:27:01,161 --> 02:27:03,920
Turn that off.
Know this was my house.

3283
02:27:03,950 --> 02:27:06,650
Okay.
You're fucking for you to do this.

3284
02:27:06,651 --> 02:27:10,760
Totally complete desensitized by the 
Internet sitting here hanging out,

3285
02:27:10,790 --> 02:27:14,030
and he just puts on some video the CIC 
jerking a guy off with her feet.

3286
02:27:14,480 --> 02:27:16,030
Really?
That's okay.

3287
02:27:16,900 --> 02:27:20,240
Don't even think twice.
Like was there any kids in the room?

3288
02:27:20,270 --> 02:27:25,270
I'll fuck it.
You just have that running in the 

3289
02:27:25,270 --> 02:27:25,530
background all the time while you're 
working for.

3290
02:27:25,560 --> 02:27:26,890
And I was just going to show it because 
like,

3291
02:27:26,930 --> 02:27:28,910
who likes that shit?
Some people must.

3292
02:27:28,970 --> 02:27:33,970
Some people must be so desensitized.
They must have porn going while they're 

3293
02:27:33,970 --> 02:27:34,430
working,
like spreadsheets right next to it.

3294
02:27:35,120 --> 02:27:36,750
Is that asked for a second.
Second.

3295
02:27:36,950 --> 02:27:38,450
Yeah.
You saw it for a second bitch.

3296
02:27:38,570 --> 02:27:40,160
You know we're not sucking cock now,
right?

3297
02:27:40,220 --> 02:27:42,350
So you cut it with a gay jokes,
man.

3298
02:27:42,440 --> 02:27:45,470
It's really not right down to 295 loyal 
listeners.

3299
02:27:45,471 --> 02:27:46,220
Ladies and gentlemen

3300
02:27:47,740 --> 02:27:52,740
to 95 were clear.
This room back to two 96 coming on 

3301
02:27:52,740 --> 02:27:53,460
strong.
It's coming back.

3302
02:27:53,470 --> 02:27:56,560
I'm not even tweeting this.
We were trying to get Eddie for the show

3303
02:27:56,561 --> 02:27:57,550
for today.
Yes,

3304
02:27:57,551 --> 02:27:59,460
my friend Andrew Lawrence.
But uh,

3305
02:27:59,530 --> 02:28:04,530
Eddie is in a plane right now on the way
to Japan chem trails all the way chem 

3306
02:28:04,681 --> 02:28:06,220
trails like a motherfucker.
I,

3307
02:28:06,280 --> 02:28:06,960
our buddy,
uh,

3308
02:28:06,970 --> 02:28:11,970
should get.
D is fighting and king of the cage and 

3309
02:28:11,970 --> 02:28:14,311
Okinawa.
So while they have to fly over there to 

3310
02:28:14,311 --> 02:28:14,440
um,
to see the fights,

3311
02:28:15,100 --> 02:28:17,230
is it awkward looking into Goldie's 
eyes?

3312
02:28:17,290 --> 02:28:17,530
No

3313
02:28:19,560 --> 02:28:20,800
gold.
He's my boy.

3314
02:28:20,830 --> 02:28:21,620
He's a good man.

3315
02:28:22,510 --> 02:28:23,090
He's a good man.

3316
02:28:24,430 --> 02:28:29,430
It's a.
that's one of the cool things about 

3317
02:28:29,430 --> 02:28:29,430
doing the UFC.
He was.

3318
02:28:29,430 --> 02:28:30,580
Mike Goldberg was telling me that he had
a Gig once upon a time,

3319
02:28:30,581 --> 02:28:32,680
there was a dream gig was an awesome 
Gig,

3320
02:28:32,681 --> 02:28:35,050
but he hated his partner.
Did Not like the guy,

3321
02:28:35,051 --> 02:28:38,680
so the guy was a deck and then gold is 
one of the nicest guys I've ever met.

3322
02:28:38,681 --> 02:28:41,740
He's such a nice guy.
Mike Goldberg is.

3323
02:28:41,741 --> 02:28:42,250
I mean,
you know,

3324
02:28:42,251 --> 02:28:45,680
people say fucks up a lot,
like the fucking guys done a hundred and

3325
02:28:45,700 --> 02:28:50,700
20 fucking UFC is going to be fuck ups.
You're going to be able to like go back 

3326
02:28:51,311 --> 02:28:56,311
in and you know,
and Youtube it and make a nice clip of 

3327
02:28:56,311 --> 02:28:56,311
him.
Fuck it up for sure.

3328
02:28:56,311 --> 02:28:58,540
But who cares?
He's a nice fucking guy.

3329
02:28:58,541 --> 02:29:00,280
He does the job.
He gets in there,

3330
02:29:00,281 --> 02:29:02,500
who knows?
He knows what the fuck is going on.

3331
02:29:02,501 --> 02:29:05,440
He makes it happen and he's a cool dude.
I like him.

3332
02:29:05,441 --> 02:29:10,441
He's a super friendly guy so it helps me
working with a nice car like that.

3333
02:29:10,600 --> 02:29:11,830
It's like I look forward to seeing them

3334
02:29:14,870 --> 02:29:17,270
on cast is the new radio.
I think it is,

3335
02:29:17,271 --> 02:29:18,410
man.
I really do.

3336
02:29:18,411 --> 02:29:20,150
I think that this is the future.
I think,

3337
02:29:20,900 --> 02:29:23,310
you know,
I think that what the role,

3338
02:29:23,360 --> 02:29:28,360
the only thing that's separate from from
regular radio is you don't have this in 

3339
02:29:28,360 --> 02:29:32,321
your car yet and that's common.
They've already come up with Internet 

3340
02:29:32,321 --> 02:29:32,321
capable,
a car,

3341
02:29:32,321 --> 02:29:37,000
a car stereos,
and you're going to be able to download 

3342
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:37,040
podcasts directly to it and a lot of 
people,

3343
02:29:37,041 --> 02:29:41,440
they have setups in their car where they
have an ipod and the just.

3344
02:29:41,620 --> 02:29:45,170
They download people's podcasts on their
ipod than they set up where they,

3345
02:29:45,220 --> 02:29:50,220
the blog broadcast a ipod through their 
car stereo speaker of you have that 

3346
02:29:50,220 --> 02:29:51,260
right?
I sit in my car and it

3347
02:29:51,480 --> 02:29:56,480
romantically connects to my iphone and 
then I had my whole itunes on my iphone 

3348
02:29:56,480 --> 02:29:57,020
play through my sink on Ford.

3349
02:29:57,440 --> 02:29:58,910
I see.
That's what I'm talking about.

3350
02:29:58,911 --> 02:30:01,790
That's the God damn future and it's 
going to be just like a dvr.

3351
02:30:01,940 --> 02:30:04,220
So you know how you get,
you know your TV shows.

3352
02:30:04,221 --> 02:30:06,130
I mean,
how often do you watch tv shows when the

3353
02:30:06,160 --> 02:30:11,160
air only if you're home and you look at 
forward to it like lost or something 

3354
02:30:11,160 --> 02:30:11,160
like that and they sit through the 
commercials,

3355
02:30:11,160 --> 02:30:16,090
but it's way better to not do that.
It's way better to do it whenever you 

3356
02:30:16,090 --> 02:30:16,490
want it and to be able to control it and
fast forward it.

3357
02:30:16,640 --> 02:30:18,620
And if you can download this as an MP 
three,

3358
02:30:18,621 --> 02:30:20,540
that's the shit.
You're in the car and you're like,

3359
02:30:20,570 --> 02:30:22,670
all these dumb motherfuckers were 
talking about mma again.

3360
02:30:22,671 --> 02:30:24,740
Leads fast forward five minutes what 
he's talking about.

3361
02:30:24,890 --> 02:30:26,390
You know what I mean?
You can do whatever you want with it.

3362
02:30:26,391 --> 02:30:29,240
It's yours.
You got it and you control what you want

3363
02:30:29,241 --> 02:30:30,530
to pause it.
You can do that.

3364
02:30:30,531 --> 02:30:32,120
You don't miss anything.
You want to rewind it.

3365
02:30:32,121 --> 02:30:37,121
You can do that.
How many times have you been listening 

3366
02:30:37,121 --> 02:30:37,121
to someone talk on the radio and they 
say some,

3367
02:30:37,160 --> 02:30:38,600
but you don't know what the fuck they 
said.

3368
02:30:38,601 --> 02:30:40,550
You tried to write it down.
You don't have anything in your car.

3369
02:30:40,551 --> 02:30:42,620
You're in traffic.
How cool would it be?

3370
02:30:42,621 --> 02:30:45,140
The rewind the radio while you can with 
this,

3371
02:30:45,141 --> 02:30:47,930
this is way superior than just 
broadcasting shit.

3372
02:30:48,050 --> 02:30:50,690
Plus there's not signals in the air that
killed the bees

3373
02:30:51,800 --> 02:30:54,260
cassette tapes for life.

3374
02:30:54,620 --> 02:30:55,370
Yeah.
Because that's.

3375
02:30:55,371 --> 02:30:56,330
Yeah.
All right.

3376
02:30:56,331 --> 02:30:57,360
Ladies and gentlemen.
Um,

3377
02:30:57,770 --> 02:30:58,710
I think that's about it.
Yeah.

3378
02:30:58,820 --> 02:31:01,760
I think we're gonna end this because 
Brian is tired and it's already 4:40.

3379
02:31:01,940 --> 02:31:04,700
So this is two hours and 40 minutes 
ladies and gentlemen.

3380
02:31:05,350 --> 02:31:10,350
So we gave you an extra 10 minutes of 
actual fake radio silence with bubbles 

3381
02:31:12,500 --> 02:31:14,660
and the whole deal.
You know what I'm saying?

3382
02:31:16,540 --> 02:31:18,710
Do I get any inspiration?
Let me answer this stuff.

3383
02:31:18,780 --> 02:31:23,780
Did you a lot of inspiration from this,
from your interactions with Tom Green 

3384
02:31:23,780 --> 02:31:24,060
yet?
That word,

3385
02:31:24,150 --> 02:31:28,620
I don't know if this thing's moving so 
fastly and his stuff.

3386
02:31:28,621 --> 02:31:33,621
This is food foods and spork shit.
It's moving so fast.

3387
02:31:37,590 --> 02:31:39,420
It's hard to fall a chat.
Um,

3388
02:31:39,840 --> 02:31:40,920
yes,
definitely.

3389
02:31:41,390 --> 02:31:46,390
We did a,
I did Tom Green show once and it's 

3390
02:31:46,390 --> 02:31:48,891
fucking awesome.
He's got this cool ass house where his 

3391
02:31:48,891 --> 02:31:49,430
whole house is basically like a,
a.

3392
02:31:49,480 --> 02:31:54,480
He turned into a studio.
He's got this killer setup where he's 

3393
02:31:54,480 --> 02:31:58,110
got like servers in his house.
I mean his house is really like the 

3394
02:31:58,110 --> 02:31:59,400
center of it all.
It's like we're using ustream.

3395
02:31:59,401 --> 02:32:01,400
Ustream obviously has,
you know,

3396
02:32:01,750 --> 02:32:06,750
some servers set up somewhere,
but we're just kinda connected to them 

3397
02:32:06,750 --> 02:32:07,770
and broadcasting to you.
Tom Green's got that shit all out of his

3398
02:32:07,771 --> 02:32:08,160
house.

3399
02:32:08,280 --> 02:32:10,770
Just really kind of a crazy expensive 
way to do it.

3400
02:32:11,430 --> 02:32:14,520
Well,
it made sense before all these websites,

3401
02:32:14,580 --> 02:32:16,680
like ustream came around.
Now it's kind of like,

3402
02:32:16,681 --> 02:32:19,970
well you didn't have to do it and how's 
Tom Ratio doing?

3403
02:32:19,971 --> 02:32:21,230
And people still watching it.
Uh,

3404
02:32:21,231 --> 02:32:23,310
I think it's paid for via now or 
something like that.

3405
02:32:23,700 --> 02:32:25,110
I think he's,
the paper view is the,

3406
02:32:25,111 --> 02:32:26,100
um,
the footage,

3407
02:32:26,101 --> 02:32:31,101
the archives,
and I think it's hard to figure out how 

3408
02:32:31,101 --> 02:32:31,240
to make money with this stuff,
you know,

3409
02:32:31,350 --> 02:32:36,350
that's what it is with these guys like 
Tom Green trying to figure out how to 

3410
02:32:36,350 --> 02:32:36,350
make money with it,
you know,

3411
02:32:36,350 --> 02:32:37,020
I think it's kind of tricky.
He's doing comedy now.

3412
02:32:37,410 --> 02:32:41,460
He's doing standup comedy tours,
so yeah,

3413
02:32:41,461 --> 02:32:42,900
we got a lot of inspiration from all 
this stuff.

3414
02:32:42,901 --> 02:32:44,640
There's a lot of cool shit on the 
Internet,

3415
02:32:44,880 --> 02:32:49,880
you know,
the Internet is where I spend a lot of 

3416
02:32:49,880 --> 02:32:49,880
my time.

3417
02:32:49,880 --> 02:32:49,880
It's what Brian spends a lot of his 
time.

3418
02:32:49,880 --> 02:32:50,250
And uh,
we,

3419
02:32:50,320 --> 02:32:52,140
we think that this is the future.
I mean,

3420
02:32:52,141 --> 02:32:54,870
I just got a thing for my car,
uh,

3421
02:32:54,930 --> 02:32:58,110
yesterday I got a new car yesterday.
I got an m three BMW,

3422
02:32:58,111 --> 02:33:03,111
m three is the shoot and um,
I got a thing where I can hook up my 

3423
02:33:03,111 --> 02:33:03,810
ipod to it.
It's awesome.

3424
02:33:03,930 --> 02:33:06,060
So my playlist showed up in the,
on the,

3425
02:33:06,061 --> 02:33:11,061
on screen the screen and I could scroll 
through it and pick songs and why it's 

3426
02:33:11,061 --> 02:33:12,210
so much better than the radio.
It's awesome.

3427
02:33:12,270 --> 02:33:13,050
You know,
it's just,

3428
02:33:13,140 --> 02:33:14,220
you can control.
I mean,

3429
02:33:14,221 --> 02:33:17,250
you can have so much shit.
There's so many interesting things.

3430
02:33:17,251 --> 02:33:22,251
You download books on tape,
there's so much shit you can throw out 

3431
02:33:22,251 --> 02:33:22,251
an Ipod,
you know,

3432
02:33:22,251 --> 02:33:22,950
instead of like scanning through the 
radio.

3433
02:33:23,010 --> 02:33:23,940
It's like,
I mean,

3434
02:33:23,941 --> 02:33:26,070
you don't even get a guide.
It's like,

3435
02:33:26,400 --> 02:33:28,950
it's like watching the TV by just 
flipping the channels,

3436
02:33:29,070 --> 02:33:29,640
you know,
you know,

3437
02:33:29,641 --> 02:33:32,040
you kind of know what's going to be on 
because you're memorized it.

3438
02:33:32,310 --> 02:33:37,310
Do you have all these gay apples and 
medical later.

3439
02:33:37,670 --> 02:33:38,730
All Right,
ladies and gentlemen,

3440
02:33:38,731 --> 02:33:40,680
thank you very much and we will see you 
next week.

3441
02:33:40,681 --> 02:33:42,390
Next week.
We're going to try to do it on Wednesday

3442
02:33:42,810 --> 02:33:47,810
and like I said,
we're going to have the shit up on 

3443
02:33:47,810 --> 02:33:47,810
itunes soon.
And uh,

3444
02:33:47,810 --> 02:33:48,720
thank you very much.
She had.
