1
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,043
All right gentlemen,
we're live with a freshly fed uriah 

2
00:00:09,351 --> 00:00:11,390
faber.
No more dieting.

3
00:00:11,391 --> 00:00:12,170
No more way.
Cutting.

4
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:13,220
Is this his mic on?

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:16,540
There we go.
Now it is.

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,510
Yeah.
Just pull that sucker up to you and cody

7
00:00:19,511 --> 00:00:22,310
motherfucking God brand finally made it.
Yeah.

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:23,320
Here.
Gentlemen,

9
00:00:23,321 --> 00:00:24,154
what's happening?
Just chilling out a nice little beach 

10
00:00:26,171 --> 00:00:29,470
run and I jumped in the ocean.
Cody kept the shoes on and all that good

11
00:00:29,471 --> 00:00:30,580
stuff.
You still got a mouthful.

12
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,580
Those green belly bars,
don't tuck it in.

13
00:00:33,581 --> 00:00:34,414
Your mouth would get squirreled away.
These teeth or specialty that have like 

14
00:00:38,921 --> 00:00:41,020
pockets in your.
I need to floss twice a day.

15
00:00:41,021 --> 00:00:42,910
This guy was making fun of me.
He's like,

16
00:00:42,911 --> 00:00:44,700
Bro,
you've been brushing your teeth 1:20

17
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,570
minutes,
20 minutes straight,

18
00:00:46,571 --> 00:00:48,280
brushing his teeth.
I brushed,

19
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:49,810
my teeth,
came,

20
00:00:49,811 --> 00:00:52,450
you know,
walked out and I was like,

21
00:00:52,451 --> 00:00:53,380
man,
he's still brushing his teeth.

22
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,680
Made me have second guessed that,
brush my teeth long enough to have to do

23
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:58,590
it again.
I'm lazy.

24
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,453
I got braces or anything.
So I've got like all these natural 

25
00:01:02,471 --> 00:01:03,304
little gaps.
It's like I'm like a squirrel food gets 

26
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:06,160
stored up in there.
I got to get it out.

27
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:07,990
I understand.
I understand.

28
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,160
How does it feel to not have to worry 
about.

29
00:01:10,161 --> 00:01:11,630
We were talking about this for the 
podcast,

30
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,900
not have to worry about weight cutting 
anymore to be able to eat healthy.

31
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:16,550
Not,
not banged up anymore.

32
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,430
Man.
It's been really,

33
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:19,323
really nice and always kind of 
envisioned after even wrestling in 

34
00:01:22,211 --> 00:01:24,730
college,
like having a break and then you know,

35
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:25,643
went 14 years longer fighting people.
But I mean it is really nice to be able 

36
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:30,581
to.
I mean,

37
00:01:30,581 --> 00:01:31,414
you go train.
I trained what I want to but I don't do 

38
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:34,470
this stuff.
I don't want to.

39
00:01:34,471 --> 00:01:36,340
I,
I get in and do the grappling rounds and

40
00:01:36,341 --> 00:01:39,920
whatnot,
but I just feel so much better here.

41
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,860
You look healthy but you made out of 
retirement.

42
00:01:41,861 --> 00:01:43,390
Perfect.
You know what I mean?

43
00:01:43,391 --> 00:01:46,870
Like you had a long career but you 
didn't get too banged up.

44
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,300
Like you just end.
You pick the right time.

45
00:01:49,301 --> 00:01:51,320
You went out with a win with a quality 
opponent,

46
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,870
like ride off into the sunset.

47
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:54,290
I know man.
I don't know.

48
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:55,124
I was a little luck.
A little bit of it just felt right 

49
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,653
though,
you know what I mean?

50
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:01,220
The last fight we went out to what,
5 million people on Big Fox.

51
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,083
It was the first fight in my hometown in
the new arena that's like the heart and 

52
00:02:07,341 --> 00:02:09,200
like revived our town.
You know,

53
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,110
we had cody fight for the belt,
like coming right up and,

54
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,180
and uh,
you know,

55
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,440
it was just perfect man.

56
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,700
It was time to good.
Good.

57
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,920
You know,
it's nice.

58
00:02:19,921 --> 00:02:23,510
It's nice to see someone do it the right
way and I hope other guys coming up can,

59
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,760
can learn from you in that regard.
Well,

60
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:29,090
what are the things I thought about was 
first and foremost,

61
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,610
like I'd been rocked more than in the 
last two and a half years of my practice

62
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,760
and live fights that I had in my entire 
career,

63
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,140
which is,
you know,

64
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,153
a lot of different factors.
Probably how many times you're rolling 

65
00:02:42,081 --> 00:02:43,310
the dice,
you know,

66
00:02:43,311 --> 00:02:44,870
you get hit in the head a bunch of 
different times.

67
00:02:44,871 --> 00:02:47,120
Things are loosening up a little bit.
You get a little bit older.

68
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:47,983
Guys are getting better.
I got cody Garbrandt and the Jim and 

69
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,680
Chad Mendez is,
and,

70
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,300
and you know,
Lance Palmer,

71
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,060
these guys hit heavy so,
you know,

72
00:02:56,061 --> 00:02:57,860
I was just like,
that's one factor.

73
00:02:57,861 --> 00:03:00,850
And then I lost two fights in a row for 
the first time in my career ever,

74
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:05,230
even though it was a decision to dominic
and the decision to uh,

75
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,900
what's his name,
uh,

76
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:13,480
and go riviera riviere Jimmy Riviera and
it was like kind of lackluster losses.

77
00:03:13,481 --> 00:03:15,150
But nonetheless it was like,
yeah,

78
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,121
just like,
you know what,

79
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:17,470
I'm not going,
I'm gonna,

80
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,600
I'm gonna.
Call this one and a good time.

81
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,120
Smart.
Very smart man.

82
00:03:21,121 --> 00:03:21,954
And I really do hope more guys learn and
pay attention to how you did it and do 

83
00:03:25,021 --> 00:03:27,510
it the right way because like,
how do you guys feel about like,

84
00:03:27,511 --> 00:03:28,770
uh,
you know,

85
00:03:28,771 --> 00:03:29,604
you seem like a lot of these guys are 
going over to Bella tour and I think 

86
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:33,810
Bella towards science,
really good fighters,

87
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,440
you know like Rory Macdonald,
Lorenz Larkin and they got,

88
00:03:37,441 --> 00:03:40,170
I mean gay garden saucy.
They got some great talent over there,

89
00:03:40,171 --> 00:03:42,190
but they also have guys that are,
you know,

90
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:45,560
late forties,
fifties still banging stuff.

91
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,100
Yeah.
Freak show stuff for me.

92
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:49,550
We always talk about this.
I tell her,

93
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:52,110
I said if I start getting fucked up and 
they're knocked out,

94
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,003
like I'm going to keep fighting,
like make sure that you pull me away 

95
00:03:55,771 --> 00:03:57,780
from my leg,
be the HMI that says,

96
00:03:57,781 --> 00:03:58,630
Hey,
sits me down.

97
00:03:58,650 --> 00:03:58,921
Like,
Hey,

98
00:03:58,921 --> 00:04:00,510
let's do a different career path.

99
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,370
You know,
if Allie say that,

100
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,840
you know,
that's one thing I always say,

101
00:04:03,841 --> 00:04:04,680
you know,
we're fighters,

102
00:04:04,681 --> 00:04:08,310
we're always going to fight through it 
and obviously a lot of different reasons

103
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,243
you know,
financially or sometimes it's just hard 

104
00:04:10,741 --> 00:04:11,574
to walk away.
What do you do in the next chapter of 

105
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,640
your life?
People don't set that up,

106
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,833
you know?
Luckily I'm fortunate I have a lot of 

107
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:17,813
good people around me so you know,
I'll have different avenues to go and I 

108
00:04:21,331 --> 00:04:21,901
always tell them,
hey,

109
00:04:21,901 --> 00:04:22,734
if I start getting fucked up in their,
stop me telling me it was important to 

110
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:26,474
understand that the kind of intensity 
and focus that's required to be a great 

111
00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:30,470
fighter,
you could do anything.

112
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:31,973
You just apply.
Just figuring out what that next thing 

113
00:04:34,951 --> 00:04:37,680
is going to be in go out at the same way
you went out your championship career.

114
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,400
Yeah.
I always tell these guys,

115
00:04:39,401 --> 00:04:40,234
you know,
we do talks before and after practice 

116
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,220
and it's like a feather in the cap 
mentality.

117
00:04:45,221 --> 00:04:48,910
Like every we've got guys in there that 
won't see the UFC daylight.

118
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,980
I mean they'll never step foot in the 
octagon,

119
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,143
but they get a little bit of pride.
Whether it was one day it was 10 years 

120
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,044
or whatever of being a part of that team
and that's something they add to their 

121
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,160
life.
They take on them with the next thing.

122
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:03,790
Somebody just comes in for a week.
Some guys are going to be,

123
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,350
you know,
make it to the big show.

124
00:05:05,351 --> 00:05:07,290
Some guys are going to be world 
champions,

125
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,230
some guy's going to be hall of Famers,
you know,

126
00:05:09,231 --> 00:05:10,070
and,
and that's,

127
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,060
that's whatever your journey is,
that's a proud thing.

128
00:05:13,061 --> 00:05:17,020
You can put a feather in the cap and 
move on to whatever you're doing next.

129
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,380
But,
but it's,

130
00:05:18,381 --> 00:05:21,310
it's a bigger picture and it's like 
journey's never over.

131
00:05:21,311 --> 00:05:22,480
It's just always changing.

132
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:23,681
Oh,
for God,

133
00:05:23,681 --> 00:05:25,940
like Lance Palmer,
who's a real world class guy,

134
00:05:25,941 --> 00:05:27,680
but he's fighting in,
what do they call it now?

135
00:05:27,681 --> 00:05:28,970
It's not world series of fighting 
anymore.

136
00:05:28,971 --> 00:05:30,140
They have a new name for it.
Right?

137
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,033
What is it?
They changed the name real pro fighters 

138
00:05:32,571 --> 00:05:34,220
or something like that.
Yeah,

139
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,130
but the problem is nobody's watching a 
few.

140
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,550
Very few people are watching,
but he's a real world class professional

141
00:05:40,551 --> 00:05:41,384
fighter.
Like you see when just engaging came 

142
00:05:42,531 --> 00:05:43,790
over to the UFC,
you realize like,

143
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,400
Hey,
this fucking kid is world class and he's

144
00:05:46,401 --> 00:05:48,830
been fighting in an organization that no
one's watching.

145
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:49,781
Right.
Well,

146
00:05:49,781 --> 00:05:50,614
I mean,
the hard part about that is like you 

147
00:05:52,571 --> 00:05:53,404
said,
you got a gate and you got to Lance 

148
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:55,983
Palmer,
they're still fighting tough ass dudes 

149
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,070
there.
So

150
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,440
it's the same level of competition 
sometimes,

151
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,633
sometimes even even worse when they get 
all the Russians over in belt or like 

152
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,420
those Russians are tough,
you know,

153
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,273
so like freelance,
we just have to exit them at the right 

154
00:06:11,151 --> 00:06:11,984
opportunity.
He asked to get on a little winning 

155
00:06:13,611 --> 00:06:16,310
streak and be at the right time in his,
in his,

156
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:19,040
in his contract and be able to jump out 
and go to the big show.

157
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,143
But uh,
it's hard because he's fighting these 

158
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:22,670
tough guys.
Like the last guy,

159
00:06:22,671 --> 00:06:23,504
he lost it,
he broke his hand the first round and 

160
00:06:25,191 --> 00:06:27,380
then he's fighting a tough guy and it's 
like,

161
00:06:27,381 --> 00:06:28,700
oh,
he lost in this show.

162
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,090
He lost against a world class dude.
And he's a world class fighter.

163
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:32,990
So,
you know,

164
00:06:32,991 --> 00:06:33,610
it's,
it's,

165
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,900
it's hopefully just something where he 
can make that transition over.

166
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:36,540
How do you guys

167
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:40,970
feel about a win lose?
Like pay days?

168
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:45,140
Like one thing that bothers me about mma
is that mma,

169
00:06:45,141 --> 00:06:45,974
if you win,
you get a certain amount and if you 

170
00:06:47,511 --> 00:06:48,980
lose,
you get less.

171
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,353
I feel like contractual.
I think I feel like you should have a 

172
00:06:52,821 --> 00:06:57,821
contractual amount that you get paid and
I feel like when you're leaving it up to

173
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:58,723
the judges sometimes and the judges,
I mean both of you guys have been 

174
00:07:01,491 --> 00:07:02,324
involved in least teammates getting 
terrible calls tall and you've seen it 

175
00:07:06,621 --> 00:07:08,000
and you go,
what in the fuck?

176
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,020
You know,
like look,

177
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:09,853
even in boxing,
the conor Mcgregor Floyd Mayweather 

178
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:12,314
fight.
Two of those judges had connor only 

179
00:07:13,731 --> 00:07:14,570
winning one round.

180
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:15,660
Yeah.
How?

181
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,440
They're crazy.
They're crazy.

182
00:07:17,441 --> 00:07:20,140
I was looking around at those judges to.
They're very familiar.

183
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:23,500
Some of them were a mma.
Make a judges also,

184
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,010
right?

185
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:24,843
There's a lot of them that did that.
They started with boxing and then they 

186
00:07:26,561 --> 00:07:30,130
learned a little bit about Emma man and 
he came over and sort of judging mma,

187
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,173
but there's a lot of them that literally
don't know what they're judging or know 

188
00:07:33,731 --> 00:07:36,660
very little about it.
And your career could be.

189
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,640
You mean you could,
you might have 100 and 100,

190
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:39,483
so $100,000
swing on someone who doesn't know Jack 

191
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:43,260
Shit.
Right?

192
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,280
Oh,
that's terrible.

193
00:07:44,281 --> 00:07:45,990
That's crazy.
Yeah,

194
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,390
that's crazy.
I guess for me as a fighter,

195
00:07:48,391 --> 00:07:51,120
I look at it like it's rewarding,
you know,

196
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:52,283
but then the opposite scale of it,
you can be on that losing call and 

197
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:56,900
horrible call the rep,
screw Ya,

198
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,260
but I don't know,
for me it's.

199
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,830
And they still appear like it's pure 
thing to do,

200
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,950
so you got to go in there and fight for 
two checks is more your training.

201
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:07,620
You come out with two checks you lose.
It's for me,

202
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:08,454
I honestly,
and I always remember getting a check 

203
00:08:11,101 --> 00:08:12,900
afterwards and especially when I first 
started,

204
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:13,950
I was like,
oh yeah,

205
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,690
I got paid for this.
Like literally,

206
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,390
like it had nothing to do with the money
at all.

207
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,550
And then you got that check and then 
you're like,

208
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,413
oh man.
So if you're doing it for the right 

209
00:08:24,391 --> 00:08:27,090
reasons,
it should be.

210
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:28,950
Yeah,
just get your set amount.

211
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,053
I think that is to warrant against the 
guys that are doing it for the wrong 

212
00:08:32,551 --> 00:08:33,384
reasons.
I think it was a good motivation at 

213
00:08:34,921 --> 00:08:36,990
first or when they're trying to build 
it,

214
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,100
but now it's not.
We're not building it anymore.

215
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,650
Now it's a world class professional 
sport and I remember Uriah when you were

216
00:08:43,651 --> 00:08:45,060
fighting in the cage,
right?

217
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:49,380
I remember the first time I saw you 
fight.

218
00:08:49,381 --> 00:08:51,640
I think you're fighting 55 to.
Yeah,

219
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,773
I had to start.
I mean there was no weight class for me 

220
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:55,140
at that time.
Yeah.

221
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,183
Now I remember talking.
I remember I was all pumped because 

222
00:08:57,631 --> 00:09:00,420
Rogan knew who I was because he followed
all the underground shit.

223
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,423
I was super self aware of like how,
how much my notoriety was and like the 

224
00:09:05,971 --> 00:09:07,340
bigger show because I,
you know,

225
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,000
Youtube,
I started looking on there and be like,

226
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,090
I only have like 1500 people watching my
shit.

227
00:09:12,091 --> 00:09:15,390
I can here and then kid Yamamoto has 
like $250,000.

228
00:09:15,391 --> 00:09:17,310
I'm like,
fuck no.

229
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,750
But yeah.
Well I was frightened.

230
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,703
I mean I fought Tyson.
My first loss was against Tyson Griffin 

231
00:09:23,641 --> 00:09:26,700
and cannot die casino and in the parking
lot.

232
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,163
And I hit him just like need him inside.
Tripped him and the head dive into the 

233
00:09:34,351 --> 00:09:35,184
steel pole and just gashed my head open 
like eight seconds into the fight and 

234
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:42,240
I'm just pouring down blood.
I remember that they didn't have padding

235
00:09:42,241 --> 00:09:43,920
on the pole,
well they supposed to do it,

236
00:09:43,921 --> 00:09:46,380
but that the crew was running out of 
time,

237
00:09:46,381 --> 00:09:49,080
so they didn't even take the time to put
the padding on the bottom level.

238
00:09:49,081 --> 00:09:53,280
They just put the clear like fake 
leather on the top of it.

239
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,840
And I'm just fucking gushing blood.
I think we talked about this last time I

240
00:09:57,841 --> 00:10:00,960
was at her show.
I think we do a man for real.

241
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,300
That was a terrible way to pave the way.

242
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,480
Fuck that.

243
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,450
You know,
like I said,

244
00:10:08,451 --> 00:10:10,730
a lot of guys can learn from you and I 
think it's good man.

245
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,250
What's it like,
you know,

246
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,600
training in his gym and like when did 
you come here?

247
00:10:14,601 --> 00:10:17,820
You came there like three years ago for 
about going on four,

248
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,340
going on four now.
It's four years.

249
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,010
I came out,
I was off an injury.

250
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:22,903
I had um,
symptoms of Vertigo from mild 

251
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,860
concussions and I broke my hand,
my pro debut,

252
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,730
so I had like a whole year layoff and 
always reach out to Uriah.

253
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,470
Lance was out there,
so I knew lance,

254
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:34,561
you know,
wrestling,

255
00:10:34,561 --> 00:10:36,410
him and his brother throughout,
you know,

256
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,410
arresting careers,
um,

257
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:41,060
is,
it always came and wanted me to come out

258
00:10:41,061 --> 00:10:43,640
there and finally hit favorite when I 
was 18 about,

259
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,533
hey,
I'm going to come out and take the gym 

260
00:10:44,841 --> 00:10:45,920
out,
see if it's good date.

261
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:47,503
He had to hit me back.
It wasn't till like four years later I 

262
00:10:49,731 --> 00:10:52,010
was able to make the trip out there and 
said out of the year off,

263
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:52,851
I was like,
dude,

264
00:10:52,851 --> 00:10:54,920
I'm not wasting any more time.
I know I'm good.

265
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:56,930
I want to see how good I am with some of
the best in the world.

266
00:10:56,931 --> 00:10:59,510
I made all those killers out there.
They had Tj,

267
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,430
Chad favor,
Joe,

268
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,750
Danny.
I mean we had.

269
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,880
Chris was on,
Holdsworth was on,

270
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:05,381
you know,
getting,

271
00:11:05,381 --> 00:11:08,260
you just won the ultimate fighter.
That's a bad dude right there.

272
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:11,270
Houses head doing uncrown champ,
Bro.

273
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:12,104
I'm telling you.

274
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,440
UNCROWN chat.
He's doing okay.

275
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:15,274
I think he's just,
it made him look at things a lot 

276
00:11:17,531 --> 00:11:20,290
different and he's like,
he's like a gem in the gym.

277
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:23,530
He's a coach for us.
And just like everybody just soaks up,

278
00:11:23,531 --> 00:11:24,100
but he's got

279
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,980
and he's eager to just going to stick 
with coaching now.

280
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:29,680
Or is he thinking about an option?
How old is Chris?

281
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:32,140
He's 27.
Still Young.

282
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,690
Very young.
And he's been off for what,

283
00:11:34,691 --> 00:11:36,970
two years now?
Almost longer.

284
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,810
Uh,
was that when Tj,

285
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,080
when the bill was his last plate,
they find the same card.

286
00:11:41,081 --> 00:11:41,914
So.
And so he was dealing with some 

287
00:11:42,971 --> 00:11:45,580
concussion issues?
Yeah,

288
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,900
a lot of guys.
I mean,

289
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:47,763
remember Tj grant was gonna fight,
Benson Henderson for the title started 

290
00:11:50,621 --> 00:11:54,070
getting some concussion issues.
I Holdsworth would have it

291
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:54,903
where I'd look at him in one,
one of his eyes would be all black and 

292
00:11:59,231 --> 00:12:01,390
one would have like a little skinny.in
the middle.

293
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,201
And I'd be like,
dude,

294
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:04,000
what's going on?
And he'd be like,

295
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:07,580
but like hosers is like Weirdo,
you know,

296
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,220
master Tang always used to say,
hey,

297
00:12:09,221 --> 00:12:11,230
you know,
tj champion,

298
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,060
uh,
you know,

299
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:16,870
80 percent holdsworth champion 100 
percent.

300
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,240
He was like,
he would never come to our,

301
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,100
our,
our team gatherings.

302
00:12:21,101 --> 00:12:22,510
He wouldn't go to the river,
he would do anything.

303
00:12:22,511 --> 00:12:25,660
He was just all about training,
like almost like a problem,

304
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,640
you know,
but that's what happened to Bj Penn,

305
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,520
Bj Penn when the,
when the Bjj world championship,

306
00:12:30,521 --> 00:12:35,521
the first American to do it and like you
get an obsession and he was just vision,

307
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:36,754
vision,
vision had this obsession to be the 

308
00:12:38,261 --> 00:12:40,570
best.
He was knocking guys out on accident and

309
00:12:40,571 --> 00:12:43,560
practice high kicks and knees,
you know,

310
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,900
with knee pads on,
like just because he was,

311
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,920
he's good all the way around.
But his Jujitsu,

312
00:12:47,921 --> 00:12:48,350
is that right?

313
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,071
Top.
Yeah.

314
00:12:49,071 --> 00:12:51,660
Super good.
And I remember coming out there and uh,

315
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,380
with all those guys know,
like a year,

316
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:54,770
a year layoff and I'll say,
man,

317
00:12:54,771 --> 00:12:56,840
I want to see how you know how good I 
am.

318
00:12:56,841 --> 00:13:01,340
So I went out there and mix well with 
good with the guys and had a fight lined

319
00:13:01,341 --> 00:13:02,750
up.
Like I have a fight in two weeks.

320
00:13:02,751 --> 00:13:03,584
I went out there for a week,
a favorite came in the last day that I 

321
00:13:06,351 --> 00:13:07,184
was there and like matching me,
like put me through the gauntlet with 

322
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,830
all these team Alpha male guys.
Uh,

323
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:12,823
it was wrestling day.
So I was going with these guys and we 

324
00:13:14,721 --> 00:13:17,860
walked off the mat and he's like,
he's like staring me up and down,

325
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:20,070
look at my tattoos like that.
He's like,

326
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,080
what do you want to do?
I'm like,

327
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,060
well,
the fight in the UFC and be world champ.

328
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,160
And he's like,
alright.

329
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:26,150
And he's like,
when can you come back out?

330
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,980
I'm like,
I'll be back out next week.

331
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,203
I'm sure $100,000
guys been in there and said the same 

332
00:13:31,881 --> 00:13:33,500
shit to him.
So I was like,

333
00:13:33,501 --> 00:13:34,660
I'll be back out.
Came out,

334
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,280
you know,
the week after we shook handshake,

335
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:37,970
he said,
all right man,

336
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:39,270
he's like,
get to five and Oh,

337
00:13:39,271 --> 00:13:42,370
and we'll get you get you to the UFC.
And I just,

338
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,170
every fight I was saving up.
I fight.

339
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,690
We came out there for a week that it 
can't knock them out.

340
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:50,480
Flew back suitcase was staying at the 
firehouse.

341
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,920
It was like 12 people in their twenties,
Jap,

342
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:53,900
you know,
Japan,

343
00:13:53,901 --> 00:13:54,980
Canada,
all over.

344
00:13:54,981 --> 00:13:56,510
I mean it was just,
man,

345
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,220
you have a weird setup,
right?

346
00:13:58,221 --> 00:14:00,310
Like do you still have that block inside

347
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:01,610
block of houses?
That's,

348
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:05,840
that's how our team got built and that 
was like I bought a house in the,

349
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:10,220
in the the time of the market where 
anybody can buy a house,

350
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:13,060
like stated income loan and I didn't.
I'm like,

351
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,340
I'm going to buy a house pre 2008 before
the crash,

352
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:19,650
before the crash it was 2005 or $2,000.
Yeah,

353
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:23,930
four or five and I had no job,
no income really.

354
00:14:23,931 --> 00:14:27,410
I was coaching wrestling camps and I was
getting like $7,000,

355
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,670
but you could do it.
My,

356
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,550
my Egypt one buddy was doing loans and 
he's like,

357
00:14:31,551 --> 00:14:32,361
I get you alone.
I'm like,

358
00:14:32,361 --> 00:14:32,901
really?
Is it?

359
00:14:32,901 --> 00:14:34,670
Yeah.
Say it didn't come do this,

360
00:14:34,671 --> 00:14:38,180
do that work history because you're 
coaching now and you went to school as a

361
00:14:38,181 --> 00:14:39,200
teacher.
It's a two year,

362
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:42,050
like all these different things.
I didn't know that that's the reason our

363
00:14:42,051 --> 00:14:45,410
whole economy crashed,
but I was able to get a fuck hidden.

364
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,300
But worked with you alone?
Yeah,

365
00:14:47,301 --> 00:14:49,070
worked for me.
I never defaulted.

366
00:14:49,071 --> 00:14:51,530
I just moved all sorts of buddies in.
I started,

367
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:56,150
I mean on that house a block and that 
block of houses we had probably probably

368
00:14:56,151 --> 00:14:58,370
45 people that went through their 
childhood there.

369
00:14:58,371 --> 00:14:59,890
Tj lived there.
Uh,

370
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,240
Justin buckles live their master tongue 
live there.

371
00:15:02,241 --> 00:15:03,074
Fabio Prado or coach lived there,
like we had four or five houses at this 

372
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,210
point.
We've been selling them off,

373
00:15:08,211 --> 00:15:09,044
so we all hopefully now the sports at a 
place where we can be in a nicer 

374
00:15:12,321 --> 00:15:13,154
neighborhood.
So we're all trying to get in the same 

375
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:18,050
neighborhood in east sac,
the fabulous 40.

376
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:21,830
So a nice neighborhood.
That's the new.

377
00:15:21,831 --> 00:15:22,790
That's a new block.

378
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:23,763
Yeah,
an interesting spot because you guys 

379
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:29,640
like surrounded by it's kind of country 
in a lot of way,

380
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,190
you know,
this is like the river.

381
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,480
It's beautiful.
I love outdoors activities.

382
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,100
Tahoes close.
Sandra.

383
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,840
Yeah,
our way.

384
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:40,890
Yeah,
you guys.

385
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,450
It's a good spot.
It's a good sentence.

386
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:45,460
Actually located spot and I mean I 
always say,

387
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,750
and I think cody,
like rough as cody's background was,

388
00:15:49,751 --> 00:15:50,584
he had a core,
like a town that like rewarded him for 

389
00:15:54,551 --> 00:15:57,970
being a champion athlete from football,
from wrestling,

390
00:15:57,971 --> 00:15:59,260
from boxing,
etc.

391
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,870
And there's a heart to it.
ThAt's why I feel like cody,

392
00:16:01,871 --> 00:16:03,520
such a good person in general,
like when you,

393
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,200
when you get cody,
like,

394
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,573
you know,
dealing with people and individuals 

395
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:11,350
walking on the street,
he's like a gentleman and like has,

396
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,060
has a heart for the kid,
you know,

397
00:16:13,061 --> 00:16:15,130
is kids that have disabilities,
you know,

398
00:16:15,131 --> 00:16:18,370
these kinds of things that comes from 
that small town where there's,

399
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:20,980
there's accountability,
you know what I mean?

400
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,730
It's like,
you know,

401
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,580
you're a good part of the community,
you know,

402
00:16:24,581 --> 00:16:27,910
that's it.
So I Think sacramento has a big city,

403
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,790
big enough city,
but a small enough town feel for that.

404
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,470
Which you lose some other places.

405
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,693
Yeah,
definitely have all the little mom and 

406
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,820
pop shops.
We go to like a big team,

407
00:16:36,821 --> 00:16:38,140
alpha male fans.
We have a discount.

408
00:16:38,141 --> 00:16:40,180
It's like almost like a friday night 
lights,

409
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:41,320
football town,
kind of like,

410
00:16:41,321 --> 00:16:42,400
oh,
we're the fighters out of there.

411
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:44,230
So we get the hookah.
We get,

412
00:16:44,231 --> 00:16:44,670
you know,
you know,

413
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,390
It's,
it's nice and everyone's super nice with

414
00:16:46,391 --> 00:16:48,040
us.
So we moved the gym.

415
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:48,874
The old gym was a downtown,
so I moved it to over by the stadium in 

416
00:16:52,781 --> 00:16:55,240
the state of the art facility.
It's great.

417
00:16:55,241 --> 00:16:57,120
So we've got to drive through phab 
forties.

418
00:16:57,121 --> 00:16:58,950
So where I live,
I drafted the five bad forties.

419
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:00,490
That's who's who make it,
you know,

420
00:17:00,491 --> 00:17:01,324
the nicest houses.
So it's always nice to drive through 

421
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:04,310
that neighborhood.
I got,

422
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,310
I'm going to buy a house here and then 
go to the gym.

423
00:17:06,311 --> 00:17:07,150
So it's,
it's nice,

424
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,640
a nice little change up this year we've 
had.

425
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,680
Yeah.
So you're right.

426
00:17:11,681 --> 00:17:15,610
Now you're prepping to fight tj to 
defend your title for the first time.

427
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,473
First of all,
what does it feel like to be ufc 

428
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,630
motherfucking bantamweight champion of 
the world?

429
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,860
Man,
it's awesome.

430
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,540
I'll have so fast.
yeah,

431
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,360
it's awesome.
You know,

432
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,860
now it's about what you do with a belt.
We were just speaking about this on our,

433
00:17:26,861 --> 00:17:27,760
on our run.
Yeah.

434
00:17:27,761 --> 00:17:31,000
He started taking off when I started 
talking about this at fired up.

435
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:35,260
I hate to run neighbor,
like he's like wants to these runs.

436
00:17:35,261 --> 00:17:40,261
He's always after the practice to do 
these like shitty ass,

437
00:17:40,481 --> 00:17:42,340
like sprints on treadmills and like,
dude,

438
00:17:42,341 --> 00:17:44,440
this is not fun,
like wants to do this at 10 minutes,

439
00:17:44,441 --> 00:17:45,900
scratch,
like just on.

440
00:17:45,901 --> 00:17:46,734
And I'm like,
he's a bit of shit that people don't 

441
00:17:47,741 --> 00:17:48,371
want to do.
I'm like,

442
00:17:48,371 --> 00:17:49,590
I don't want to do this.
I'd rather,

443
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:52,500
I just hate writing movie was.
And he was like,

444
00:17:52,501 --> 00:17:53,000
all right,

445
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,310
do you think that running?
Like,

446
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:57,620
I've had a conversation with a friend of
mine about this with conor mcgregor,

447
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,570
conor doesn't run.
And he was like,

448
00:17:59,571 --> 00:18:00,404
I really feel like every athlete that's 
doing something that requires real 

449
00:18:04,461 --> 00:18:05,294
endurance,
like boxing or mma or something like 

450
00:18:06,621 --> 00:18:10,130
that should run that.
Like the act of moving your body,

451
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,173
like forcing your body,
like your legs propelling your body and 

452
00:18:13,581 --> 00:18:14,414
constantly working your lungs builds you
like the kind of lung stamina and 

453
00:18:18,321 --> 00:18:20,030
strength that you can't get from 
anything else.

454
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,530
Um,
so this,

455
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:26,580
that's a good question and it's all 
different because I mean we,

456
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,840
me and cody had a discussion and I'm 
like,

457
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,130
this title fight.
I'm like,

458
00:18:30,131 --> 00:18:31,540
cody,
look dude,

459
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,240
I know you don't like to do them.
I want you to do these fucking runs.

460
00:18:34,241 --> 00:18:35,074
I'll get on a treadmill and do like a 10
minute or put it on 10 and run for five 

461
00:18:38,711 --> 00:18:39,544
minutes straight and then I'll and then 
I'll put it on 12 is a little incline 

462
00:18:42,851 --> 00:18:43,684
and do like 40 seconds on,
20 seconds off and I had to do it with 

463
00:18:45,701 --> 00:18:46,271
me once.
He was like,

464
00:18:46,271 --> 00:18:46,841
bro.
He goes,

465
00:18:46,841 --> 00:18:48,580
look,
I've always,

466
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,070
I've done this kind of thing.
I don't really like to run.

467
00:18:51,071 --> 00:18:54,310
It's not part of my regimen.
I guarantee I'm gonna be in great shape.

468
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,250
And he went in there and he fought 
dominick cruz and I mean,

469
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:58,323
so you can't really argue with that,
but in my opinion I think it's a great 

470
00:19:02,411 --> 00:19:03,760
way to get yourself uncomfortable.

471
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,170
You can run easier,
you can run hard to simulate the feeling

472
00:19:08,171 --> 00:19:09,910
where your lungs are going to blow up 
in,

473
00:19:09,911 --> 00:19:12,160
your head's going to pop in your fucking
teeth hurt.

474
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:15,130
like I like to be able to do that with,
with running.

475
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:17,823
But you can get the same thing at a hard
goal in wrestling or jujitsu go if 

476
00:19:20,471 --> 00:19:21,304
you're pushing the pace or a boxing go.
If you can simulate that type of like 

477
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:25,893
energy and expenditure.
But you're forced to do it when you're 

478
00:19:28,181 --> 00:19:29,980
running really,
really fast until you.

479
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:31,690
Until you stop.
There's no coasting,

480
00:19:31,691 --> 00:19:32,524
right?
Yeah.

481
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,450
But it's funny.
I asked dan henderson,

482
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,840
I asked dan harrison his good buddy.
I'm like,

483
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:39,483
when I first started fighting,
you know I was trained with randy 

484
00:19:41,411 --> 00:19:43,750
couture and dan henderson.
They would come out to sacramento and do

485
00:19:43,751 --> 00:19:48,070
little camps and stuff and I ask a.
I asked dan or dan henderson's buddy.

486
00:19:48,071 --> 00:19:48,730
I'm like,
bro,

487
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:53,730
how many days a week this dan and run 
and this is 2006.

488
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:58,840
And he's like,
dan hasn't ran and 12 years.

489
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,720
And that motherfuckers is savage.
Dude,

490
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,240
he's a savage.
He is a savage.

491
00:20:04,241 --> 00:20:05,430
Yeah,
mike.

492
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,930
He's a mentally toughest dude ever.

493
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,420
My uncle was all like old school 
trainer,

494
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,430
so we'd like pad work,
bag,

495
00:20:12,431 --> 00:20:14,340
work,
run shadow box,

496
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:15,170
you know,
and,

497
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:16,030
and spar.
We get.

498
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,880
When I was younger he would get us 50 
rounds of work.

499
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,710
It's like you get 50 rounds,
you're ready for a fight.

500
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:23,410
We'd always spar 50 rounds of boxing 
rounds when you're younger.

501
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:27,160
50 rounds and rounds fight before the 
fight.

502
00:20:27,161 --> 00:20:29,740
So it could be five rounds,
10 times.

503
00:20:29,741 --> 00:20:30,574
Is that what you mean?
Yeah,

504
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:33,070
throughout the four or five weekends to 
your fight,

505
00:20:33,071 --> 00:20:33,930
you know,
fight every.

506
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,770
Sometimes we live in the tri tristate 
area.

507
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,790
So I would fight and I had a bunch of 
books I'd fight in Ohio on friday,

508
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:42,790
saturday and Pennsylvania,
West Virginia on sunday.

509
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,650
So I had three fights and we can't do 
that anymore,

510
00:20:44,651 --> 00:20:47,800
but we lived in the tristate so we 
always had these regional books,

511
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,060
you know,
and if I,

512
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,190
I got this book,
you only have five fights,

513
00:20:51,191 --> 00:20:52,050
you know,
this guy's,

514
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:54,970
you know,
has 100 so box amateur boxing was almost

515
00:20:54,971 --> 00:20:56,170
like am dressing.

516
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,250
they're always,
you know,

517
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,280
competing like that.
But he never really forced us to run.

518
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:01,480
We always spark,
you know,

519
00:21:01,481 --> 00:21:03,070
that's when you really fight would 
happen.

520
00:21:03,071 --> 00:21:05,710
So I'm just composing that.
He always told me growing up,

521
00:21:05,711 --> 00:21:06,544
he's like,
fighting doesn't make you a better 

522
00:21:06,941 --> 00:21:09,400
runner or running doesn't make you a 
better fighter,

523
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:12,070
so I just always tell it to favorite.
Every time he wants you to do those damn

524
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:15,520
runs he's running doesn't make you a 
better fighter.

525
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:16,763
Yeah.
There's a bunch of different schools of 

526
00:21:17,261 --> 00:21:21,100
thought on it and some people think that
you have to run like long distance.

527
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,253
Just enable your body to dig deep in 
those late rounds when you're getting 

528
00:21:26,321 --> 00:21:27,970
tired that you'll have more endurance.
That way

529
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:30,130
it doesn't hurt.
That's true,

530
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:34,510
but the whole thought process behind one
person's theory.

531
00:21:34,511 --> 00:21:35,344
This is why I can't stand coaches that I
think it's the only way you know what 

532
00:21:39,151 --> 00:21:39,984
always learn.
Of course you always want input from 

533
00:21:41,021 --> 00:21:42,640
other people and you have things at 
work,

534
00:21:42,641 --> 00:21:44,480
but like even my,
my,

535
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,343
my manager back in the day,
he always used to worry about Chad 

536
00:21:47,471 --> 00:21:50,920
mendez,
his training because like Chad mendez,

537
00:21:50,921 --> 00:21:51,754
lance palmer,
those are two guys that had been 

538
00:21:53,081 --> 00:21:56,470
training since they were five years old 
on a regimen,

539
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:57,663
like their dads pushing them,
making them go to this and making them 

540
00:21:59,591 --> 00:22:00,424
do that and so they're.
They're like little vacations they got 

541
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:06,910
were like the most they needed that they
needed to go,

542
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,980
go hunting or go fishing and get the 
break.

543
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:10,300
For me,
I was always.

544
00:22:10,301 --> 00:22:11,134
My dad,
we'd.

545
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,420
He dropped the trailer off.
We'd have a,

546
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,860
a motor home.

547
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:17,140
He dropped it off at a pawn.
He'd go to work and we'd fish all day.

548
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:18,730
Knew no one was having me wrestle or do 
anything.

549
00:22:18,731 --> 00:22:21,400
I didn't start till I was in the eighth 
grade,

550
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:26,170
so I've always been on like a,
like trying to catch up kind of deal and

551
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:28,690
like a chat and lance are like,
get your homework done.

552
00:22:28,691 --> 00:22:29,524
You train your butt off,
you do a regimen and then you take your 

553
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:32,890
little break and then you'd take your 
breaks,

554
00:22:32,891 --> 00:22:34,720
you know,
and it doesn't matter.

555
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:35,943
It's just about what you,
what you're processing as your method 

556
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,480
that you believe in.
As long as you really believe in it.

557
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:41,853
That's the most important thing.
The belief system is bigger than 

558
00:22:43,961 --> 00:22:44,530
anything else.

559
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,363
It's gotta be,
there's gotta be different methods for 

560
00:22:46,961 --> 00:22:50,560
different fighting styles too.
I mean some people move around more like

561
00:22:50,561 --> 00:22:54,400
dominic and some people are more,
more stationary and you know,

562
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,253
rely more on power.
I mean there's got gotta be different 

563
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:58,773
routines that would be more effect and 
it's kind of about finding whatever 

564
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:02,440
works best for you.
Right.

565
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:03,910
Exactly.
For me,

566
00:23:03,911 --> 00:23:06,550
I like sprints on like a very explosive 
fighter,

567
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,020
but also I have endurance.
She was like,

568
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,213
I did the vo two testing.
It's actually I tested as a cross 

569
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:14,170
country runner.
I hate running on the results,

570
00:23:14,171 --> 00:23:14,950
you know,
so,

571
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:15,850
but I'm,
well I feel like I'm,

572
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,740
I do better at spreading then long 
distance,

573
00:23:17,741 --> 00:23:20,050
but it's crazy.
Like what,

574
00:23:20,051 --> 00:23:23,390
you have to be in shape for going,
you know,

575
00:23:23,391 --> 00:23:24,224
to fight for the cage.
Like you have to be a great wrestling 

576
00:23:26,441 --> 00:23:27,810
conditioning,
boxing conditions.

577
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:31,450
Those are all different conditioning.
It's like a boxer comes in and wrestles.

578
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:35,800
he's toasting a minute if that.
sometimes wrestlers they same thing.

579
00:23:35,801 --> 00:23:38,350
They go in there,
their box color just to composure,

580
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,660
you know,
that's what made with herbs.

581
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,530
I would.
Connor said right after mayweather.

582
00:23:41,531 --> 00:23:43,120
He said shots were nothing.
He didn't,

583
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:45,040
you know,
it was just the composure.

584
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,130
Allen's logged

585
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:48,070
in.
He's just so efficient to any new.

586
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:48,933
The connor was going to fade because 
connor was relying so much on 

587
00:23:50,781 --> 00:23:52,770
explosiveness and tense and so

588
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:54,590
and they didn't have enough time to 
prepare.

589
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:57,163
I thought,
I thought connor did a good job of 

590
00:23:58,221 --> 00:24:01,220
staying nice and flow and everything.
But here's,

591
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,083
here's the truth.
It's like if I were to take a pretty 

592
00:24:05,211 --> 00:24:06,044
good high school wrestler or like a even
like a really good high school wrestler 

593
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:13,340
and put them against an olympic gold 
medalist,

594
00:24:13,341 --> 00:24:14,174
like,
like a high high level high school 

595
00:24:15,501 --> 00:24:18,140
wrestler versus an olympic gold 
medalist.

596
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:20,480
I mean,
there's going to be a difference,

597
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:23,540
but when,
when the fatigue cracks a little bit,

598
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:25,423
it starts happening a little bit.
one guy's gonna keep composure 

599
00:24:27,711 --> 00:24:28,544
completely and the other guy going to 
have a little bit of a of an opening in 

600
00:24:31,641 --> 00:24:32,474
the other guy will be able to to to,
to isolate that and I think that's what 

601
00:24:35,421 --> 00:24:38,690
happened with the fight and I figured 
that would happen.

602
00:24:38,691 --> 00:24:40,850
I just didn't think that connor would do
that well,

603
00:24:40,851 --> 00:24:42,620
the whole fight until it happened,
you know,

604
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:43,730
he was doing awesome.

605
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:44,683
It makes me wonder like,
how would he have done if he had six 

606
00:24:46,941 --> 00:24:49,780
months to prepare,
how good would he have done if he got in

607
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,273
good shape?
I mean it might've been able to make it 

608
00:24:52,521 --> 00:24:53,354
to the twelfth round.
I think either way the more loose floyd 

609
00:24:56,871 --> 00:24:57,704
got,
the more he was going to start landing 

610
00:24:58,491 --> 00:25:00,530
shots.
He's just a far better boxer.

611
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:01,723
He's especially.

612
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:04,450
I don't think it was.
I don't think it would be.

613
00:25:04,451 --> 00:25:05,284
It's about getting in shape necessarily 
because connor had to be in amazing 

614
00:25:08,471 --> 00:25:10,210
shape.
He's already a world champion.

615
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:14,380
Then he's got this big opportunity.
That's what I always tell the guys also,

616
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,270
it doesn't matter what kind of shape 
you're in.

617
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:21,040
Being a cheap only means you can do more
until you get tired.

618
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,980
I think the better shape you're in.
He would've kept doing more,

619
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:24,970
do more,
do more,

620
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,450
and if he wasn't able to finish him,
you know what I mean?

621
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:31,290
Because floyd was lettIng him do more.
I mean it wasn't letting him,

622
00:25:31,291 --> 00:25:34,930
he was wasn't letting him necessarily,
but it was taken rounds on for sure.

623
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:38,340
Letting connor blow out to manager.
So it's,

624
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,303
it's like the better shape you're in,
the more you're going to output until 

625
00:25:41,261 --> 00:25:43,420
you get tired,
but if you're trying to fucking win,

626
00:25:43,421 --> 00:25:44,500
you're going to be,
you know,

627
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:47,350
you're going to be putting it out,
putting it out,

628
00:25:47,351 --> 00:25:48,184
putting out.
I think he would have been able to do 

629
00:25:49,031 --> 00:25:51,610
more until he got tired.
But the fatigue would set in.

630
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,590
Yeah,
there was.

631
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:56,120
We had this in our wrestling room,
a board saying,

632
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:58,300
I said,
fatigue makes cowards of us all know.

633
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,280
I read that.
I was like,

634
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,413
I had this.
I was in the same restroom since I was 

635
00:26:01,171 --> 00:26:02,490
five years old.
All the way until,

636
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,680
you know,
sophomore year,

637
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:07,050
junior year I was done wrestling,
but I always read that I was like,

638
00:26:07,051 --> 00:26:07,950
man fatigue,
you know,

639
00:26:07,951 --> 00:26:09,720
I was like,
I don't even know if it was,

640
00:26:09,721 --> 00:26:10,554
but I knew what a coward was.
So it was like I knew they didn't go 

641
00:26:12,001 --> 00:26:14,250
right.
So I would literally go so hard.

642
00:26:14,251 --> 00:26:16,200
I know how to wrestle really.
I would just would go,

643
00:26:16,201 --> 00:26:16,621
go,
go,

644
00:26:16,621 --> 00:26:18,420
go and just keep scrambling out of 
things.

645
00:26:18,421 --> 00:26:19,254
And that's how I always dress well.
And my brother was like the same exact 

646
00:26:22,651 --> 00:26:23,410
way.
It was a grinder,

647
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:26,040
old school wrestler and I had him 
pushing me.

648
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:29,080
So it was always that fatigue,
fatigue makes cowards of us all.

649
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:30,990
So when you get tired you're always 
going to get tired in the fight.

650
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:33,570
Like I didn't know,
I've never been to the fourth round.

651
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:34,750
Been in the third one.
So you know,

652
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:37,170
with,
with cruz had all these questions like,

653
00:26:37,171 --> 00:26:38,004
oh,
how is it going to be as composures can 

654
00:26:39,591 --> 00:26:40,290
they go,
you know,

655
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:42,660
keep that power and speed up the fifth 
round.

656
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:43,763
Shit.
I didn't know how I prepared for that 

657
00:26:45,571 --> 00:26:48,240
and believe that's the thing,
it just believing I was tired,

658
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:49,103
but I was having so much fun in there.
You juSt kind of pushed through that 

659
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,473
when you're tIred.
And that's the thing when fatigue sets 

660
00:26:52,891 --> 00:26:53,724
in,
some people can either wilt from it or 

661
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,200
you know,
propel them to like,

662
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,880
when I get tired I feel like I biked 
down while I'm more iSo index.

663
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:01,773
I'm tired.
I know that mistakes happen when you're 

664
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:03,931
tired.
So he has,

665
00:27:03,931 --> 00:27:04,764
when he's got to stay on it more to 
concentrate more on keeping your 

666
00:27:08,191 --> 00:27:10,590
technique clean and making sure that 
you,

667
00:27:10,591 --> 00:27:11,341
uh,
well,

668
00:27:11,341 --> 00:27:12,174
it's an interesting thing when you're 
fighting a guy like dominic crew too 

669
00:27:14,461 --> 00:27:16,980
because he's so awkward.
Like,

670
00:27:16,981 --> 00:27:17,511
you,
you're,

671
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:19,870
you're preparing for someone who moves 
in such a way.

672
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:20,701
I mean,
you're right.

673
00:27:20,701 --> 00:27:23,310
you knew better than anybody.
You fought them several times.

674
00:27:23,311 --> 00:27:25,470
So he was so weird.
You know,

675
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,330
he does move weird,
like the second time I fought him,

676
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,980
uh,
I feel like it did a good job of,

677
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,400
of like letting him move and then when 
he'd landed,

678
00:27:34,401 --> 00:27:35,234
hit him.
And so the one thing I went back and I 

679
00:27:37,791 --> 00:27:39,290
watched that fight and I'm like,
you know,

680
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:41,840
you're always looking at excuses of why,
you know,

681
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:46,860
why did I lose this fight or not?
And I think little things count,

682
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:50,600
and I talked to cody about this in his,
in his fight with,

683
00:27:50,601 --> 00:27:51,434
uh,
with don was let's make sure the eyes 

684
00:27:52,941 --> 00:27:53,774
are on you when there's no action 
happening because dominic has always 

685
00:27:56,751 --> 00:27:58,340
doing this weird.
It's like peacocking,

686
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,640
he's moving and doing these little 
movements and weird shit.

687
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,220
And so when,
when nothing's happening,

688
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:06,770
who you're looking at,
you're looking at the weirdo,

689
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,550
you know what I'm saying this,
he said yeah.

690
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:14,240
So then it's like,
he is weird,

691
00:28:14,241 --> 00:28:16,330
but it's not like,
oh,

692
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,170
it's a different kind of weird.

693
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:22,140
What was it like doing the ultimate 
fighter opposite tj,

694
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,273
like knowing that you guys were 
eventually going to fight and knowing 

695
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:27,570
that you guys used to be teammates.
Honestly,

696
00:28:27,571 --> 00:28:30,170
it Wasn't bad.
Like for the first two,

697
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,620
three weeks,
it was fine.

698
00:28:31,621 --> 00:28:32,540
We were cordial,
like,

699
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,650
you know,
it was what it was.

700
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:35,963
And,
uh,

701
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:41,210
until he started going to like the media
and like would say that I'm different on

702
00:28:41,281 --> 00:28:43,860
and off camera.
I was like,

703
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,211
dude,
like tj,

704
00:28:45,211 --> 00:28:47,550
we were just like being cordial and 
cool,

705
00:28:47,551 --> 00:28:49,830
like getting through the weigh ins and 
doing that whole process.

706
00:28:49,831 --> 00:28:50,664
Honestly.
It's,

707
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:51,960
it's a lot,
you know?

708
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,870
Right.
I'm still trying to train and fight,

709
00:28:54,871 --> 00:28:56,340
but it was opportunity.
I love to do it.

710
00:28:56,341 --> 00:28:58,190
I love the guys a team.
Um,

711
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,540
had my coaches out there,
my aliquot out in vegas.

712
00:29:00,541 --> 00:29:01,374
It was a good time.
We had a good time with the team and we 

713
00:29:03,031 --> 00:29:04,170
were fine until,
like I said,

714
00:29:04,171 --> 00:29:06,570
he would go to the media and like talk 
shit.

715
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:11,310
Sal was different like about choking one
when he was talking shit.

716
00:29:11,311 --> 00:29:13,200
And he stepped towards me.
So I was like,

717
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,450
so you're saying that.
And so we cornered,

718
00:29:15,451 --> 00:29:16,790
I cornered him,
uh,

719
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:18,950
and the,
and the and the,

720
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:19,541
and the.
Yeah.

721
00:29:19,541 --> 00:29:21,060
And that with no cameras like tj,
I was like man,

722
00:29:21,061 --> 00:29:22,500
what's going on?
Why are you talking shit?

723
00:29:22,501 --> 00:29:24,360
And the media saying that I'm different 
on and off camera.

724
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,550
Like I wouldn't beat Your ass you right 
now.

725
00:29:26,551 --> 00:29:28,300
Cause there's no camera.
he's like,

726
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:29,760
you think that?
And he's like,

727
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:31,163
no,
I don't think you would whoop my ass 

728
00:29:31,531 --> 00:29:32,364
right now if I grabbed his ass up again 
when I throw it and slam against any 

729
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,210
like squared up with me.
And I was like,

730
00:29:36,211 --> 00:29:37,044
all right,
we're gonna throw down like cool with 

731
00:29:37,731 --> 00:29:39,300
just me and him.
We'll throw it down and that's it.

732
00:29:39,301 --> 00:29:40,134
No cameras around and maybe will subside
some of the shit because I was getting 

733
00:29:43,211 --> 00:29:43,490
pissed.

734
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,920
He was being with me,
you know,

735
00:29:44,921 --> 00:29:46,570
right there.
How many people were there when you guys

736
00:29:46,571 --> 00:29:47,800
almost fun?
No,

737
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:52,840
it was him.
I was there and just got out the shower,

738
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,190
the shower,
have a picture of it.

739
00:29:54,191 --> 00:29:58,560
So if I sit there like it is tough but 
as just confused on.

740
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,770
And I was like dude we're,
we're cool.

741
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,280
Cordial with each other.
And then you go on in the media.

742
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,310
That's when I started.
I was like man,

743
00:30:03,311 --> 00:30:04,930
I was just kinda like fed up with the 
whole thing.

744
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,470
But now it's like so long drawn out for 
the fight.

745
00:30:08,471 --> 00:30:10,210
I'm just like,
if you take all that away,

746
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,490
him leaving team alpha male,
um,

747
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:17,710
all the variables and he's breaking down
against fighter verse spider.

748
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,220
This is a fucking fight that I like,
thankful for,

749
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,083
you know what I mean?
I'm finally getting to fight these 

750
00:30:22,691 --> 00:30:25,660
opponents that are,
they're worthy opponents that can go out

751
00:30:25,661 --> 00:30:27,580
there and show,
showcase my skill against,

752
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:30,070
you know,
so it wasn't a horrible and being around

753
00:30:30,071 --> 00:30:30,904
the guy until he would go and talk,
show in the media and I was just like a 

754
00:30:33,201 --> 00:30:34,210
pod bouncing man,
what is,

755
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:34,820
what is going on?

756
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:37,450
How did you guys resolve it when you 
were alone in the locker room?

757
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,693
Dude,
everybody came with literally broke it 

758
00:30:40,781 --> 00:30:41,561
up.
Did that happen?

759
00:30:41,561 --> 00:30:42,394
Well,
that happened and then he like put his 

760
00:30:43,391 --> 00:30:44,350
fist up and I was like,
all right,

761
00:30:44,351 --> 00:30:44,910
here we go.
I was,

762
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,990
I was just gonna throw some fire.
Adam,

763
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,850
we're going to fight like,
all right,

764
00:30:48,851 --> 00:30:49,684
cool.
He's going to fight me.

765
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:52,540
And then uh,
he put his hands down and he was like,

766
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:55,150
look how you're acting bro.
And I was like,

767
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,133
oh,
like he went from straight ready to 

768
00:30:57,071 --> 00:30:58,960
fight and then to that.
So I was like,

769
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,033
whatever it is what it is,
I'll just like do quit talking shit on 

770
00:31:01,571 --> 00:31:02,740
the media.
Like right here,

771
00:31:02,741 --> 00:31:03,574
you cAn say it to me.
like I don't know why we don't have a 

772
00:31:04,251 --> 00:31:04,900
con.
You know,

773
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,700
we can talk about it in a couple of 
times.

774
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,533
We've had off camera talks with me and 
him about the whole joe daddy stevenson 

775
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,201
fight.
I was like,

776
00:31:11,201 --> 00:31:12,034
look bro,
I understand you're trying to get your 

777
00:31:13,721 --> 00:31:16,180
guy back on,
but joe should not fight.

778
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:19,210
He took so much damage in that fight and
he's fighting in six days.

779
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:23,470
I'm tWenty five years old and I would 
not fight in five or six days after.

780
00:31:23,471 --> 00:31:28,471
I just felt like that he was concussed.
He was hurt and teachers like a man,

781
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:30,850
like I can't tell them not to fight.
I'm like,

782
00:31:30,851 --> 00:31:32,320
you have to tell them like you're a 
coach.

783
00:31:32,321 --> 00:31:35,970
You can't call his wife or his coach or 
you have to sit and do it.

784
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,813
We can have.
I don't want my teammates fighting each 

785
00:31:37,781 --> 00:31:38,680
other,
but dude,

786
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,780
that's going to be bad.
I said he's going to get knocked out and

787
00:31:40,781 --> 00:31:41,614
be hurt,
you know,

788
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:42,970
and teachers like,
don't,

789
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,150
don't get that in his head coding.

790
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,630
I'm like joe and we were doing in front 
of joe.

791
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,031
I'm like,
joe,

792
00:31:46,031 --> 00:31:47,230
look,
I love your pioneer.

793
00:31:47,231 --> 00:31:48,970
Like you're,
you're alleging that sport.

794
00:31:48,971 --> 00:31:51,640
You don't need to go out here and get 
$10,000

795
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:54,130
and for whatever it was they were 
getting,

796
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:57,370
getting into that fight to go in there 
and have serious brain damage.

797
00:31:57,371 --> 00:32:01,000
He's fighting.
Hydro hydro has I think eight knockouts,

798
00:32:01,001 --> 00:32:02,470
vicious knockouts.
He throws his hands.

799
00:32:02,471 --> 00:32:05,590
I knew it was a bad matchup,
you know,

800
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:07,750
it was,
that was an ego thing,

801
00:32:07,751 --> 00:32:08,710
tj.
One and his whole team,

802
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,540
because he was,
he kicked your ass on the team.

803
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,471
You know,
we didn't,

804
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:14,450
we didn't silently pick the best match 
ups or you know,

805
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:17,380
it was in there trying to do what we 
could with those guys.

806
00:32:17,381 --> 00:32:18,740
You know,
it was,

807
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,570
it was,
it was tough.

808
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:20,403
You know,
it's like teaching an old dog new 

809
00:32:22,211 --> 00:32:23,080
tricks.
It was just,

810
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,420
it was hard.
It was honestly hard.

811
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:29,200
It's got to be weird coaching people in 
a short period oF time like that to me.

812
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:32,230
You really need veterans.
Right?

813
00:32:32,231 --> 00:32:33,160
So it was,
it was.

814
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:37,450
We had no,
I didn't do any of my research on them,

815
00:32:37,451 --> 00:32:40,010
like how they did outside of the ufc 
career,

816
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,860
you know,
I remember I'm in the ufc,

817
00:32:41,861 --> 00:32:42,381
I'm like,
okay,

818
00:32:42,381 --> 00:32:43,220
you know,
this guys,

819
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:45,770
he can fight eddie gordon.
So these massive,

820
00:32:45,771 --> 00:32:46,940
let's go with him.
You know,

821
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:50,420
how we just didn't know like how they 
did outside of it,

822
00:32:50,421 --> 00:32:51,254
you know.
So I would have just assumed that like 

823
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:53,283
as a coach,
if you get anybody and you're working 

824
00:32:55,281 --> 00:32:57,650
with for six weeks,
you would start thinking,

825
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,680
oh,
if I had six months exactly rid of this.

826
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:01,603
Yeah.
What I noticed when I coached against 

827
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,920
don,
we had a,

828
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:06,020
we had three months.
Oh that's right.

829
00:33:06,021 --> 00:33:08,150
Because you guys did.
There was the crazy alive.

830
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:10,730
The only life season.
What was that like?

831
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:15,890
How's your life?
that was vegas been all these guys.

832
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:16,890
They,
I was,

833
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,230
I was staying under wraps.
But uh,

834
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,840
you know,
we had the whole crew out there.

835
00:33:20,841 --> 00:33:24,200
It was all my coaches were just the 
young guys coming up to try and get them

836
00:33:24,201 --> 00:33:28,040
exposure and everything,
so I had tj and lance and you know,

837
00:33:28,041 --> 00:33:30,590
all the,
all the guys were my coaches.

838
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:33,000
They're running a muck in vegas.
It was

839
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:36,220
various three connor season.
That was when I came out.

840
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:38,830
That was.
I was ready to leave vegas.

841
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:41,440
Like I couldn't wait to leave vegas 
after that.

842
00:33:41,441 --> 00:33:42,274
It was just.

843
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,660
Yeah,
same as cody is what my coaches remember

844
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:46,380
for the bigger.
Yeah,

845
00:33:46,381 --> 00:33:46,680
it seems

846
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,513
send me that like vegas to live in vegas
is kind of like living near a nuclear 

847
00:33:51,301 --> 00:33:52,134
reactor.
Like you may be able to do it for a 

848
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:54,863
couple days,
but after awhile the radiation is going 

849
00:33:56,661 --> 00:34:01,661
to get you one wrong decision from a 
whole change of life.

850
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:04,883
Yeah.
All of a sudden you won't have seen 

851
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,000
daytime for,
for a couple.

852
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:11,310
This also in my,
my feelings on it is that your round,

853
00:34:11,311 --> 00:34:12,144
like maybe it's just me being sensitive,
but I think you're around people that 

854
00:34:14,821 --> 00:34:15,654
make shitty decisions allowed to around 
a lot of that in vegas because you're 

855
00:34:18,481 --> 00:34:22,230
around a lot of compulsive gamblers.
Just a vibe of the city,

856
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:25,380
like there's great shit in the city,
there's a lot of successful people,

857
00:34:25,381 --> 00:34:27,810
you know,
dana and the fertittas and there's a lot

858
00:34:27,811 --> 00:34:30,660
of people that are making great money 
and doing well in business,

859
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:35,900
but then there's a whole like underbelly
to the city that's compulsive gamblers,

860
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:39,160
have a ship and a bunch of other stuff,
compulsive,

861
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:40,190
all sorts of stuff.
Yeah,

862
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:41,830
yeah,
yeah.

863
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:45,980
But uh,
I think the.

864
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:48,110
It'S funny,
like you go to la,

865
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:51,050
this is mostly talking about like,
you know,

866
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,410
people have that are trying to get into 
the entertainment industry or whatever.

867
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:55,483
It's like la is like a social climate.
If you take the crappy part of the 

868
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:01,620
social scene,
it's people trying to socially climbing,

869
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:02,630
oh,
if you do for work,

870
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,450
oh,
what a car is kind of,

871
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:08,150
what can I get out of this person and 
try to play the game and have success in

872
00:35:08,151 --> 00:35:09,920
vegas has just sold out.
Like,

873
00:35:09,921 --> 00:35:10,754
all right,
I'm going to go get a bunch of fucking 

874
00:35:12,081 --> 00:35:15,620
money stripping this cocktail,
Whatever it is.

875
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:19,850
Yeah,
whatever the deal is or whatever it is.

876
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,670
So it's like la social climb,
vegas sold out.

877
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:27,730
Well it just doesn't seem like a vegas 
has a,

878
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:28,643
like

879
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:29,803
there's a lot of transient people and 
there's a lot of people that are there 

880
00:35:31,521 --> 00:35:34,310
just for the casinos.
Whereas like any other city,

881
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:37,070
if you live in chicago for instance,
it's a town,

882
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,160
you know,
it's a real city.

883
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,820
People been there for generation after 
generations,

884
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:43,020
a lot of different businesses,
a lot of variety to it.

885
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,183
In vegas you got the hub which is all 
the casinos and then you got the 

886
00:35:48,691 --> 00:35:52,140
surrounding areas that are just sort of 
feeding off of the casinos.

887
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:54,080
It's weird.
It's a weird gig.

888
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,710
Weird.
Great.

889
00:35:55,711 --> 00:35:57,440
Great for short,
short times.

890
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:57,820
Yeah.

891
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:01,150
The one thing I would say it was cool 
while you're there is,

892
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:03,790
I mean sacramento's not necessarily a 
destination spot.

893
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:06,580
So while I was living there and people 
knew that we were living there,

894
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:07,623
I would get hit up like every couple of 
days with somebody that was coming to 

895
00:36:10,661 --> 00:36:12,880
vegas.
So there's always like,

896
00:36:12,881 --> 00:36:15,880
you get to rehash,
like see all sorts of people that you,

897
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,430
uh,
you know,

898
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:20,080
would like to see that are,
that are popping into vegas.

899
00:36:20,081 --> 00:36:22,240
All of a sudden it's like damn 
everybody's hitting you up.

900
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:23,650
Like it's like,
you know,

901
00:36:23,651 --> 00:36:25,420
it's kinda like a little reunion place,
you know,

902
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,800
we go there all the time

903
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:29,400
now.
As far as your new place,

904
00:36:29,401 --> 00:36:32,010
like what did you do differently when 
you guys moved to the new spot?

905
00:36:32,011 --> 00:36:35,400
Like how did you set it up?
The old spot for a long time,

906
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:36,234
right?

907
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,780
yeah.
You got to check out the place.

908
00:36:37,781 --> 00:36:38,170
He'll love.

909
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:39,670
I saw it online.
It looks amazing.

910
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:44,710
So basically we just made it bigger and 
better and tried to cover all the things

911
00:36:44,841 --> 00:36:48,080
that we do as mixed martial artists 
within one roof.

912
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:50,990
So we have crossfit,
we have yoga,

913
00:36:50,991 --> 00:36:53,390
we have a trx,
we have,

914
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,480
you know,
conditioning classes that are,

915
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,860
you know,
mma base.

916
00:36:57,861 --> 00:37:00,890
We have introduction to stuff.
And then we have the mma side,

917
00:37:00,891 --> 00:37:04,880
which is a traditional moitai are,
are pros happen,

918
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:05,743
work out of there.
We have our own little locker room for 

919
00:37:08,661 --> 00:37:10,280
the,
for the pros and we have like,

920
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,160
like nice finishes.
There's a cafe there,

921
00:37:13,161 --> 00:37:15,730
there's an outdoor area,
there's like,

922
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:16,723
you know,
bathrooms and showers and that's 

923
00:37:18,411 --> 00:37:20,420
amazing.
The other place was just,

924
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:22,250
it was 8,500
square feet,

925
00:37:22,251 --> 00:37:26,570
which is still pretty big at the time.
It was just cutting edge and it was like

926
00:37:26,571 --> 00:37:27,404
one shower,
one toilet and it was 13 years of 

927
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:34,940
building the team and the place stunk.

928
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,620
That's a good recipe for staff and 
shower.

929
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,740
First time I ever got staff was when I 
went out to team alpha male.

930
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,153
It was right before my ufc debut.
Literally like remember that two weekS 

931
00:37:44,671 --> 00:37:46,200
to three weeks beforehand?
No,

932
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,510
I got the call like,
you're going to fight in three weeks.

933
00:37:48,511 --> 00:37:50,240
I'm like,
yeah.

934
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:52,500
Did you get on antibiotics?
Antibiotics?

935
00:37:52,501 --> 00:37:54,090
Yeah.
I remember it was like,

936
00:37:54,091 --> 00:37:54,811
why are you taking it on?
I'm like,

937
00:37:54,811 --> 00:37:56,910
dude,
I got staff and like in my leg,

938
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:58,470
like couldn't walk.
It was horrible.

939
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,553
First time I had it.
And was it from not showering right 

940
00:38:02,191 --> 00:38:05,720
after you trained or just have staff all
over again?

941
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,520
Body habit,
your nose and everything else.

942
00:38:07,521 --> 00:38:12,521
I think immune system down and then cut,
you know,

943
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,850
do you guys fuck with defense soap?
Yep.

944
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,000
That's,
that stuff is this shit guy.

945
00:38:18,001 --> 00:38:20,160
Seiko jakks is awesome.
This boy,

946
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:21,840
great guy.
Great guy.

947
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:22,674
So,
and that,

948
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,533
that product is fucking amazing.
He has a bunch of different things like 

949
00:38:25,531 --> 00:38:27,960
solve for scratches.
This ointment,

950
00:38:27,961 --> 00:38:30,210
this tea tree oil and eucalyptus and 
stuff like that.

951
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:32,203
Yeah.
But you could stay on that stuff on a 

952
00:38:33,901 --> 00:38:36,010
regular.
you will 99 percent

953
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,990
of that shit.
They getting that sleep,

954
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:40,670
getting sleep and eating right.
And,

955
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,280
and,
and you know,

956
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,220
shout out.
What kind of diet are you on cody?

957
00:38:45,221 --> 00:38:46,350
Like how do you,
uh,

958
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:47,283
how do you organize your nutrition?
Actually spoke with aubrey a couple of 

959
00:38:50,731 --> 00:38:51,564
weeks ago.
We did like opposite and submit 

960
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:55,060
standpoint from onnit.
You gave me a whole protocol.

961
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:56,370
W wait,
you know,

962
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,150
for this camp,
daytime,

963
00:38:58,151 --> 00:39:02,200
nighttime stuff really matter.
I can eat whatever I want.

964
00:39:02,201 --> 00:39:03,034
I have a super high.
It's hard for me honestly to gain 

965
00:39:05,081 --> 00:39:07,240
weight.
Like I'm hovering around 1:47

966
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:08,870
after workout,
put so high,

967
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,380
so high and I don't,
not never been a big year.

968
00:39:12,381 --> 00:39:13,214
Like I never liked to be full.
Like I don't like that because I don't 

969
00:39:15,671 --> 00:39:16,950
know.
So I just,

970
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:20,340
I usually do some meal preps.
I messed with some meal prep companies.

971
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:21,183
Um,
my wife's a great cook so she usually I 

972
00:39:22,661 --> 00:39:23,494
eat a lot of salmon.

973
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:26,150
I love salmon or bison.
Um,

974
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,600
so I keep it at the end.
George lockhart,

975
00:39:29,601 --> 00:39:32,080
I worked with him so he,
he scraped the whole diet.

976
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:33,993
Here's my card,
here's the proteins and then we get to 

977
00:39:36,281 --> 00:39:37,114
the fight week and I'm literally 12 
pounds over and I start doing his diet 

978
00:39:41,141 --> 00:39:44,140
and water loading and I don't run,
I don't have to,

979
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:47,370
I just do my workouts regularly.
Like I would for a,

980
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:49,600
you know,
just to keep sharp for the week,

981
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:51,720
lose the weight.
I mean it's the best.

982
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,990
I feel the greatest,
you know,

983
00:39:52,991 --> 00:39:53,824
I used to always cut weight within,
like cut a lot way and then get up and 

984
00:39:57,671 --> 00:39:58,504
feel sluggish.
Like with with george and the diet that 

985
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:02,440
he's given me an asa with,
with the onnit products,

986
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,473
I've for two months I had been on the 
honor products and I feel so much like 

987
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,260
just better,
better with them like joint wise,

988
00:40:10,261 --> 00:40:11,500
like I had such defense.

989
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,760
I got a,
like I said,

990
00:40:12,761 --> 00:40:15,190
abra gave me a whole thing that this 
krill oil pills,

991
00:40:15,191 --> 00:40:16,024
all that stuff,
giant men official is so important for 

992
00:40:18,851 --> 00:40:19,684
people and so many people don't take it,
but it's just for joint mobility and 

993
00:40:23,051 --> 00:40:25,210
joint health and just reduction of 
inflammation.

994
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:29,320
Also it's fuel for your brain.
It's great for building your muscles,

995
00:40:29,321 --> 00:40:30,154
like fish oils.
Just one of the primary supplements I 

996
00:40:32,111 --> 00:40:32,944
think people should take.
My mom used to have us take spoons of 

997
00:40:35,291 --> 00:40:37,060
that,
not the pills.

998
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:40,630
She would actually have fIsh oil and I 
have that stuff.

999
00:40:40,631 --> 00:40:41,610
I get it.
Crossings,

1000
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,600
I get it in a jar,
two tablespoons of it,

1001
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,780
but they have it.
They you put like lemon flavor in it and

1002
00:40:46,781 --> 00:40:49,550
different things,
but it always tastes like shit.

1003
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,030
Shit.
Tastes like shit.

1004
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:55,810
Not true.
Not good.

1005
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:58,360
Yeah.
So you just essentially eating healthy,

1006
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,233
you know,
you don't have like any specific diet 

1007
00:41:00,431 --> 00:41:01,150
you follow?

1008
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:01,983
No,
I mean I,

1009
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:03,040
I stick to the,
you know,

1010
00:41:03,041 --> 00:41:04,570
the lean stuff,
get sushi,

1011
00:41:04,571 --> 00:41:05,950
salmon.
I always do that.

1012
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:06,813
Um,
we have a bunch of good little healthy 

1013
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:11,950
spots around town too.
We got a.

1014
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:14,290
Actually I'll send you out some juice or
liquid.

1015
00:41:14,291 --> 00:41:15,940
Ology juice.
It'S fresh juice.

1016
00:41:15,941 --> 00:41:19,900
We have two spots that are like right by
the gym.

1017
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:22,780
They have like super healthy foods.
Yeah,

1018
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:23,643
it's like a health bar.
So you guys have almost like a whole 

1019
00:41:25,871 --> 00:41:28,900
fitness location there.
It's not just a gym.

1020
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:29,410
Right.
You know,

1021
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:31,000
and how many,
how many members you have now?

1022
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:34,010
We're like 1400 members.
What's the name of the

1023
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:35,410
place again?
Your ifa?

1024
00:41:35,411 --> 00:41:37,430
Results meant fitness.
That's it.

1025
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,333
Yeah.
Because I know you were thinking about 

1026
00:41:38,961 --> 00:41:40,950
doing something with the ufc gym at one 
time,

1027
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:42,200
right?
We have one,

1028
00:41:42,201 --> 00:41:46,550
we have one out there,
one of those 35 minutes away as well.

1029
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:47,413
That's in rocklin,
which is about 35 minutes away and I've 

1030
00:41:50,601 --> 00:41:51,434
got a partner there who is a gym guy.
He has crunch gyms and he's in tight 

1031
00:41:56,691 --> 00:41:57,524
with mastrov and the guys that ufc gym 
and so he Primarily runs that and 

1032
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,440
there's no contact in that,
in that place.

1033
00:42:03,441 --> 00:42:04,274
You know,
you can't do sparring and things like 

1034
00:42:05,871 --> 00:42:06,470
that.
So.

1035
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:11,470
Oh really know any of the ufc gyms.
So when they have like,

1036
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:13,490
oh,
so you could strangle each other.

1037
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:15,590
You can't kick or punch Egypt.

1038
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,690
So when they have like kickboxing 
classes,

1039
00:42:17,691 --> 00:42:19,250
do they tap each other at least?

1040
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:22,340
No.
They the bag work and no drills.

1041
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:23,683
I mean,
you're not going to learn if you don't 

1042
00:42:26,181 --> 00:42:27,440
do something.
They do.

1043
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:29,240
They do some jobs they don't do any 
like,

1044
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,520
no,
they don't have like one,

1045
00:42:30,521 --> 00:42:32,830
one person hold mitts and one person 
hold,

1046
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:34,940
but he could do privates and stuff like 
that.

1047
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:37,570
IS it just like a liability thing?
I would imagine.

1048
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:39,410
Probably worried.
Yeah.

1049
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:43,400
Well at least they can do jujitsu and 
jujitsu and you learn great technIque.

1050
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:47,540
It's a great idea too to have a gym 
that's based around the ufc where people

1051
00:42:47,541 --> 00:42:51,020
were fans can go and learn that kind of 
stuff and get a great workout.

1052
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:53,060
Just see what they should have.
Bob arum said today,

1053
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:57,560
so we have a boxIng as an enemy and it's
the ufc.

1054
00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:01,460
The ufc is the enemy of boxing.
He's still a little dummy.

1055
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,270
Fuck bob.
Tell me.

1056
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:09,070
Well you just,
you just got six point 5 million pay per

1057
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:12,080
view buys from mayweather versus 
macgregor and a bus match.

1058
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:15,050
So you tell me how the ufc is the enemy.
You silly

1059
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,950
few out dude made.
Made,

1060
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:19,540
made boxing cool again.

1061
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:20,583
Definitely.
I guarantee you it bumped up canelo 

1062
00:43:22,071 --> 00:43:25,360
alvarez and triple tops.
Watch the 24 slash seven while.

1063
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:26,203
Yeah,
me too.

1064
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:28,790
Boy.
I don't know.

1065
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:29,713
I don't know.
Look,

1066
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:30,553
nautica lufkin is a motherfucker dude,
but canelo alvarez get gets better all 

1067
00:43:33,981 --> 00:43:35,420
the time.
See a younger guy,

1068
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:36,463
you know,
he looked fucking sensational against 

1069
00:43:37,491 --> 00:43:39,110
amir khan.
He's looked sensational.

1070
00:43:39,111 --> 00:43:43,940
It gets everybody except floyd floyd.
JusT floyd got them to drain himself.

1071
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:46,940
Go all the way down to 1:50
1:52

1072
00:43:46,941 --> 00:43:49,240
or something and cut down that far.
Yeah,

1073
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:51,620
he cut down way low and they just look 
sluggish.

1074
00:43:51,621 --> 00:43:56,210
And floyd is the best boxer,
pretty much ever that he is boxed him up

1075
00:43:56,211 --> 00:43:59,420
game plan and stick to the game and just
look beautiful.

1076
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:04,160
Did triple g's interviews are hilarious.
Like traditional,

1077
00:44:04,161 --> 00:44:06,080
like russian,
you know,

1078
00:44:06,081 --> 00:44:07,430
it sounds like.
Exactly.

1079
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:10,620
Max max.
I hear it for big drama show.

1080
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:11,820
Yeah,
exactly.

1081
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:16,020
Of course.
I think it would be a good fight for the

1082
00:44:16,021 --> 00:44:18,210
fans.
That's what I'm here for.

1083
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:19,660
more chose christ.
Yes.

1084
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:24,060
My friends,
mexicans love triple g fights.

1085
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:25,950
Like fucking julio.
Cesar chavez.

1086
00:44:25,951 --> 00:44:26,880
Man.
He's a savage.

1087
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:29,890
He's a fucking animal.
Body puncher and ripping shots.

1088
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:31,680
Well if is going to get it,
cody.

1089
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:35,070
Man,
I think honestly canelo.

1090
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:37,560
I don't know,
I just think,

1091
00:44:37,561 --> 00:44:38,080
you know,
a,

1092
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,740
a triple g is a beast.
I think

1093
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:43,600
you like to know.
Why do you like to know on this?

1094
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:44,921
I just like his,
his,

1095
00:44:44,921 --> 00:44:47,890
his um,
his pressure is body punches,

1096
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:49,110
you know,
is the,

1097
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:52,200
how he flows.
He throws a lot of hooks on it.

1098
00:44:52,201 --> 00:44:54,670
Like I'm a big hook guy.
so like any,

1099
00:44:54,671 --> 00:44:55,504
like Mike Tyson,
I used to watch all my stuff hooks and 

1100
00:44:58,001 --> 00:44:59,830
canelo does too.
Um,

1101
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:03,790
he throwS some creative stuff to die.
So I did that.

1102
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:07,060
I started doing a move off of watching 
canelo.

1103
00:45:07,061 --> 00:45:10,150
He throws like a fake hook to an upper 
cut.

1104
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:11,253
So it's like this and it goes like that 
because the guy who covered here and it 

1105
00:45:13,541 --> 00:45:16,900
comes right up the middle.
I mean my didn't look as good as his.

1106
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:17,793
I didn't punch against scotty jorgensen 
when I find it looked like I was just 

1107
00:45:19,871 --> 00:45:20,830
winding my,
my,

1108
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:23,590
my arm up like this.
But it's like,

1109
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:26,140
well,
but he has a bunch of little tricky,

1110
00:45:26,141 --> 00:45:28,330
subtle things he does.
I like canelo.

1111
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,850
He also his ring generalship like that's
huge for me.

1112
00:45:30,851 --> 00:45:34,480
Like I caught you can knock people out 
fast or have good combos,

1113
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:35,314
but the way that you take the octagon or
the ring and stock them and then impose 

1114
00:45:40,601 --> 00:45:41,710
your will on him.
His,

1115
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:44,500
his presence in there.
He knows where he's at all the time.

1116
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:45,523
Yeah.
What's interesting to me about this 

1117
00:45:46,191 --> 00:45:51,170
fight is this is the first time that 
he's fought a guy who's world class that

1118
00:45:51,171 --> 00:45:55,490
is a brutal power puncher like him who's
bigger than him,

1119
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:57,590
who's going to come towards him,
you know?

1120
00:45:57,591 --> 00:45:59,870
Whereas he fought floyd for.
It was a smaller guy,

1121
00:45:59,871 --> 00:46:03,560
but just way craftier and slicker with 
the style and you know,

1122
00:46:03,561 --> 00:46:04,394
it was an interesting fight,
but ultimately it wasn't like the most 

1123
00:46:06,651 --> 00:46:08,660
exciting fight because floyd just kinda 
outboxed him.

1124
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:11,060
I think this is going to be a bang of my
fight.

1125
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:11,930
I.
Yeah,

1126
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:15,730
I think you're going to come towards 
each other and it's gonna get crazy for,

1127
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,990
for real.
This is like the highest stakes fight in

1128
00:46:17,991 --> 00:46:21,500
boxing because you have two murderers 
punchers in their prime.

1129
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:22,633
Gennady golovkin undefeated.
The only person canelo last two is 

1130
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:27,860
floyd.
That was only last.

1131
00:46:27,861 --> 00:46:28,694
Yeah.
This is the only last and it's been 

1132
00:46:29,141 --> 00:46:29,840
decisions to use.

1133
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,040
15 professional,
young,

1134
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:32,240
50.
Phenomenal.

1135
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:33,520
Phenomenal.
I mean,

1136
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:34,363
just such a good fight.
I cannot wait for this fight all amped 

1137
00:46:36,801 --> 00:46:37,460
up.
That's what I was with.

1138
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:39,090
Oscar tweeted about,
you know,

1139
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:40,770
he's all about it.
I as they,

1140
00:46:40,771 --> 00:46:41,510
dude,
we're still gonna.

1141
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:43,940
Watch you.
This is why they're all fools.

1142
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:45,560
If,
if oscar just said,

1143
00:46:45,561 --> 00:46:48,110
this is great for boxing,
this is great for everybody,

1144
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:50,690
then everybody would have been fine.
Instead these guys create enemies.

1145
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:52,670
Know and say,
this is a disgrace.

1146
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:55,030
This is a fixed five numbers.
They're saying,

1147
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,410
floyd,
if fixed the fight and you know,

1148
00:46:57,430 --> 00:47:02,270
they're still saying some crazy shit.
I aSked her is losing his mind.

1149
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:07,190
Dana dana is like,
is he doing blow and cross dressing data

1150
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,880
is a savage.
He's,

1151
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:14,910
he'll call them and they'll come outside
of my picks about like some,

1152
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:16,640
you know,
if I posted about them or something like

1153
00:47:16,641 --> 00:47:18,080
that.
He just kills people.

1154
00:47:18,081 --> 00:47:19,460
He don't,
he does not give a fuck.

1155
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:21,170
It's so funny.
He's hilarious.

1156
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:23,270
That's what happens when you have a half
a billion dollars.

1157
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:24,503
You don't give a fuck I guess.
Well he didn't give a fuck in the 

1158
00:47:26,841 --> 00:47:27,674
beginning,
which is why he was perfect for the ufc 

1159
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,040
picture.

1160
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,050
He went right before he,
uh,

1161
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:36,190
right after he did the whole deal where 
they sold and everything he was on like,

1162
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:39,420
and he was on some show.
And he was just slouched over,

1163
00:47:39,421 --> 00:47:43,150
look like a like a pile of crap,
and I took a picture of it and I sent it

1164
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:43,691
to him.
I said,

1165
00:47:43,691 --> 00:47:46,410
bro,
why don't you sit like you have $400,

1166
00:47:46,411 --> 00:47:50,140
million dollars in the thing or at least
investments of some fucking fitness shit

1167
00:47:50,141 --> 00:47:50,974
or something.
I sent him a picture just all slumped 

1168
00:47:53,831 --> 00:47:56,560
over like this.
I think he's super stressed.

1169
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:57,953
I think he's better now.
I think that time was like a crazy ass 

1170
00:48:00,491 --> 00:48:01,324
time.
Could you imagine you're about to get 

1171
00:48:02,081 --> 00:48:04,390
involved in a $4,000,000,000
deal.

1172
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:07,660
And then how about afterwards all the 
shit starts falling apart.

1173
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:10,780
Rhonda gets murked.
Connor decides to go to boxing,

1174
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:11,441
you know,
the,

1175
00:48:11,441 --> 00:48:12,274
the,
the sports fallen off in a lot of the 

1176
00:48:14,171 --> 00:48:17,320
pay per view buys jon jones test 
positive again.

1177
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:19,810
Like what's up?
Like so much.

1178
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:24,580
I mean he was on his way to being a next
gigantic superstar.

1179
00:48:24,581 --> 00:48:26,600
Right?
I mean if you take away his,

1180
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:27,820
his time off,
right?

1181
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:28,813
The time off where you get busted before
he had to take a whole year off because 

1182
00:48:31,691 --> 00:48:34,180
of the dick pills,
all this different stuff.

1183
00:48:34,181 --> 00:48:35,014
That time off from the car accident take
all the time off and john keeps winning 

1184
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:41,640
and you got a goddamn gigantic 
superstar.

1185
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,010
The likes of like anybody that's ever 
been in the ufc,

1186
00:48:45,011 --> 00:48:47,260
maybe even right up there with connor 
means you don't know.

1187
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:48,153
Even even.
I mean all the negative stuff that's 

1188
00:48:50,411 --> 00:48:51,244
happened in John Jones,
people are still booming dc and cheered 

1189
00:48:53,831 --> 00:48:54,664
him.
He has some great pr going that I don't 

1190
00:48:58,061 --> 00:48:59,350
think it's that at all.
I don't think it's.

1191
00:48:59,351 --> 00:49:00,184
I don't think theY have the brain.
I don't think anybody alive has the 

1192
00:49:02,621 --> 00:49:04,390
brains to organize public response.

1193
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:08,790
I think public people tweet to pe.
They love john becauSe what john is,

1194
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:09,643
first of all,
he's a ruthless killer inside the 

1195
00:49:10,811 --> 00:49:13,630
octagon and then he's like,
he fucks up,

1196
00:49:13,631 --> 00:49:15,350
but he's still a bad motherfucker.
Like he.

1197
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:17,203
He was getting booed and everything and 
then he took the time off and then by 

1198
00:49:20,351 --> 00:49:22,570
the time he came back,
people were back out to the side.

1199
00:49:22,571 --> 00:49:24,430
It's like,
you know,

1200
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:27,180
he glued.
When was he getting booed there?

1201
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:32,190
He's getting booed a like before he got 
suspended the time before.

1202
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:34,270
Really?
Yeah.

1203
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:38,130
When he tested positive for coke,
I can't remember.

1204
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:38,973
I'm getting booed and if but if he was,
it was nothing like dc dc winds fights 

1205
00:49:41,981 --> 00:49:43,150
and gets booed.
Crazy.

1206
00:49:43,151 --> 00:49:44,540
You kNow what I mean?
He beats rumbling.

1207
00:49:44,541 --> 00:49:46,240
He gets booed.
People get mad at them.

1208
00:49:46,241 --> 00:49:47,440
They got mad at him when he beat 
rumbled.

1209
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,600
Member were blowing them like,
what are you blowing?

1210
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:50,433
The guy just fucking choked out.
Rumble johnson like how we kill it for 

1211
00:49:53,321 --> 00:49:55,090
the second time.
How are you doing?

1212
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,710
I don't get it,
but you can't.

1213
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:57,673
The public.
Yeah.

1214
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:00,420
You can't contribute fickle.
Just decide.

1215
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:01,593
Exactly.
They decide who they love and they 

1216
00:50:03,251 --> 00:50:05,470
decide who they hate to tell you what 
though?

1217
00:50:05,471 --> 00:50:07,930
John's speech after he beat dc was 
beautiful.

1218
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:09,210
That was great.
It was.

1219
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,073
It was great,
but it was followed up by a steroid 

1220
00:50:11,850 --> 00:50:13,540
tests.
That's why it's so sad.

1221
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,060
I've been looking.
I'm hoping just like everybody else.

1222
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:16,953
There was some sort of a fuck up and 
then we figured out that someThing 

1223
00:50:20,681 --> 00:50:22,180
happened.
Something was wrong.

1224
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:24,370
Well,
I haven't really followed it too much.

1225
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:27,200
I don't really know the good.
It's not good.

1226
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:28,093
Well,
he tested positive for something that 

1227
00:50:29,271 --> 00:50:30,104
only shows up in urine tests.
And so they did a urine test after the 

1228
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:33,590
way ends.

1229
00:50:33,590 --> 00:50:37,040
He tested positive for this stuff and 
then they did a blood test and you know,

1230
00:50:37,041 --> 00:50:38,360
he's his campus saying,
oh,

1231
00:50:38,361 --> 00:50:40,610
it's not in the blood test.
Well they don't test for it in the blood

1232
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:41,463
tests.
That's why they do a urine test and a 

1233
00:50:42,561 --> 00:50:44,710
blood test.
It's a two different tests like d ball,

1234
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:48,200
like the main tee ball team,
toronto ball or something like that.

1235
00:50:48,201 --> 00:50:50,810
At some it's a weird substance that not 
a lot of people take.

1236
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:52,870
So um,
um,

1237
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:55,820
apparently chael sonnen was talking 
about it that if he's taken that like,

1238
00:50:55,821 --> 00:50:59,870
this is real old school steroid took a 
short acting short,

1239
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:01,690
short half life.
Steroids

1240
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:04,320
just me out,
man.

1241
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,060
It's sad.
It's sad.

1242
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:08,700
I,
I just don't think I've been.

1243
00:51:08,701 --> 00:51:10,590
What's,
what are you proving?

1244
00:51:10,591 --> 00:51:11,520
That's my whole thing.

1245
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:12,403
Well,
he must have felt like you needed some 

1246
00:51:13,731 --> 00:51:15,320
sort of an edge.
If he took it.

1247
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:19,010
He took it or,
or the real problem is,

1248
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:19,873
or was he taking stuff the whole time?
Did he get involved with those power 

1249
00:51:23,361 --> 00:51:26,590
lifter dudes and start taking shit 
because remember he's got fucking suit.

1250
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:28,710
Her dad was just massive.

1251
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:29,633
yeah.
I mean he literally was going to 

1252
00:51:29,851 --> 00:51:31,900
heavyweight.
He looks huge.

1253
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:35,600
I mean,
I don't want to speculate at all really.

1254
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:37,280
Yeah,
I know.

1255
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,070
But uh,

1256
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:38,903
but you were involved in the sport in 
the early days when there was no 

1257
00:51:41,281 --> 00:51:42,540
testing,
they just look at you.

1258
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:44,940
Yeah,
I mean when you were,

1259
00:51:44,941 --> 00:51:46,590
when you were first finding like Kenya 
cage,

1260
00:51:46,591 --> 00:51:47,730
was there any drug testing?

1261
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,510
No,
nothing.

1262
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:51,970
Not at all.
There wasn't any type of anything.

1263
00:51:51,971 --> 00:51:54,580
I mean it was illegal in California,
so the,

1264
00:51:54,581 --> 00:51:55,414
the only reason we were fighting on 
indian reservations because everything 

1265
00:51:57,761 --> 00:51:58,340
was illegal.

1266
00:51:58,340 --> 00:51:59,173
Isn't that crazy that native americans 
do whatever the fuck they want because 

1267
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,740
we screwed them so bad.
But it's not a way.

1268
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,000
I mean,
it's happened so many generations ago.

1269
00:52:08,001 --> 00:52:09,560
It's kind oF weird that it's still 
around,

1270
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:13,910
but they have like this sort of.
They have a nation inside a nation.

1271
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:15,800
So it's very odd little situation

1272
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:16,673
over in the u,
s we talk about the holocaust and what 

1273
00:52:18,391 --> 00:52:20,820
happened over there and over in like 
Germany,

1274
00:52:20,821 --> 00:52:22,590
they talk about what we did,
the indians.

1275
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:23,693
Well you know what we did at the indian,
we were here when it comes to like 

1276
00:52:27,751 --> 00:52:29,700
genocide.
You know what the biggest genocide was?

1277
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:31,130
Disease.
Yeah.

1278
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:35,280
Ninety percent of them were killed by 
smallpox and all sorts of bugs that they

1279
00:52:35,281 --> 00:52:36,114
just had no resistance from.
That's right when they first met the 

1280
00:52:39,061 --> 00:52:42,300
europeans and it had nothing to do with 
like a planned attack on them.

1281
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,970
People were just dying off like crazy.
That's what happened.

1282
00:52:44,971 --> 00:52:46,110
That's right.
Terrific.

1283
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:47,810
That's crazy.
Yeah.

1284
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:49,830
but it's a thank god they have casinos.

1285
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:52,253
So I've got a bUnch oF buddies that are 
native and so they have like different 

1286
00:52:55,251 --> 00:52:58,670
things in one tribe.
Like you had things you Could,

1287
00:52:58,790 --> 00:53:02,240
you could choose one group up in 
northern coast,

1288
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:07,070
took their fishing rights so they can 
fish with nets and like put bombs in the

1289
00:53:07,071 --> 00:53:09,620
water and.
But they didn't take the,

1290
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:13,940
the casino fucked up.
they did fuck all the fish.

1291
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,120
Casino money.
They they slang that smoked salmon.

1292
00:53:17,121 --> 00:53:18,410
It's good.
It is good,

1293
00:53:18,411 --> 00:53:20,270
but it's not like the casino money.

1294
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:23,690
You buy a lot of smoke sound foxwoods 
cash.

1295
00:53:23,691 --> 00:53:24,800
Exactly.
Yeah.

1296
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:25,650
There was um,
a,

1297
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:28,870
a place in alberta where,
uh,

1298
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:31,620
I've been hunting up there and the 
natives,

1299
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:33,510
they call them first nation people up 
there.

1300
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:35,250
They're allowed to basically hunt 
anyway.

1301
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:38,070
They want these spotlights and shoot 
animals at night.

1302
00:53:38,071 --> 00:53:39,690
They shoot as many as they were their 
rights,

1303
00:53:39,691 --> 00:53:40,171
right?
Yeah.

1304
00:53:40,171 --> 00:53:43,750
That's part of the deal.
They fish casino,

1305
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:47,263
he got free moose have free.
They're just allowed to use all sorts 

1306
00:53:50,521 --> 00:53:51,210
of,
you know,

1307
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:53,610
what other people would think of is 
unethical techniques.

1308
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:56,010
Do you have any hunting trips coming up?
Yeah.

1309
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:57,900
Yeah.
Mom going to Utah soon.

1310
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:00,330
Alcon a couple of weeks.
We're excited.

1311
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,900
You eat mostly.
I know Chad does that,

1312
00:54:03,901 --> 00:54:05,460
but tries to eat mostly food that he's

1313
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:09,760
killed themselves as much as I can.
Ninety nine percent of the food I eat is

1314
00:54:09,761 --> 00:54:12,580
wild game other than vegetables.
Yeah.

1315
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:13,241
Shit.
well,

1316
00:54:13,241 --> 00:54:15,820
if you could shoot an elk,
like either those ell kids that are.

1317
00:54:15,821 --> 00:54:18,340
How back?
That's 400 pounds of meat.

1318
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:20,550
I give a lot of it to my friends who 
don't hunt,

1319
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:21,610
you know,
just like elk.

1320
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:23,140
But uh,
that's,

1321
00:54:23,350 --> 00:54:27,160
that's enough meat for a year and then I
usually shoot a deer to a year.

1322
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:28,613
Yeah.
And that's what trips me out about 

1323
00:54:29,161 --> 00:54:30,630
people that are so against hunting.
I mean,

1324
00:54:30,631 --> 00:54:32,940
I'm not a big hunter,
but uh,

1325
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:37,260
like the things that happened,
like on the farm is where they're like,

1326
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:39,840
you know,
have animals,

1327
00:54:39,841 --> 00:54:41,820
is cajun and try to feed him getting 
fat.

1328
00:54:41,821 --> 00:54:42,654
I mean,
that's some nasty stuff and this is way 

1329
00:54:44,641 --> 00:54:46,920
more humane and a healthier way to eat.
Right.

1330
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:50,030
It's definitely healthier way to eat and
it's definitely way more humane.

1331
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:51,223
people love to point the finger.
90 seven percent of the people in this 

1332
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:56,870
country meet either that or they're 
pescatarian and they eat,

1333
00:54:57,130 --> 00:54:57,963
but you know,
that there's maybe three percent of the 

1334
00:54:59,481 --> 00:55:02,030
people in this country that are vegans 
and that's a,

1335
00:55:02,031 --> 00:55:03,830
that's a small number.
But you know,

1336
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:04,693
they,
they get very vocal about it and the 

1337
00:55:06,830 --> 00:55:10,220
best way for them to like,
they can find a person,

1338
00:55:10,221 --> 00:55:11,054
like say if you hunt,
you hold a picture of a deer that you 

1339
00:55:12,321 --> 00:55:13,660
shot,
they found you,

1340
00:55:13,661 --> 00:55:15,650
you're you.
So the urine individually.

1341
00:55:15,890 --> 00:55:19,880
Whereas like if you have a steak,
like that steak was raised by a rancher,

1342
00:55:19,881 --> 00:55:21,950
it's on a ranch.
Who's the guy who shot at,

1343
00:55:21,951 --> 00:55:23,240
who knows,
but you got it.

1344
00:55:23,241 --> 00:55:24,800
A supermarket.
Here it is,

1345
00:55:25,070 --> 00:55:27,680
is too many.
Too many people down the line.

1346
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:29,300
It's not.
You can't point to one person.

1347
00:55:29,301 --> 00:55:34,010
But if I see uriah faber or holding up a
doc that he shot like,

1348
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:34,930
well that's you,
you,

1349
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:37,830
you killed that dog.
Get the vegan cat lady after you.

1350
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,680
Again.
It's true.

1351
00:55:39,681 --> 00:55:42,590
That's true.
That's true.

1352
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:44,090
That's a true bit,
man.

1353
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:45,500
That's the true bit.
This,

1354
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:46,393
this bunch of.
It's a community of people that think 

1355
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:49,730
it's a good idea to feed their cat vegan
food.

1356
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:53,840
Yeah.
There's a whole move to feed cats,

1357
00:55:53,841 --> 00:55:55,180
vegan food,
and the cats can take it.

1358
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,470
They go blind and have heart attacks and
shit.

1359
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:58,880
Yes,
yes.

1360
00:55:59,270 --> 00:56:00,103
Yeah.
Cats are supposed to eat something 

1361
00:56:00,891 --> 00:56:01,724
called taurine that only exists in 
animal food and like in an animal 

1362
00:56:06,081 --> 00:56:06,914
protein,
cats are what's called an obligate 

1363
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:09,164
carnivore,
which means they can't eat anything 

1364
00:56:10,911 --> 00:56:13,160
else.
It's like a dog.

1365
00:56:13,190 --> 00:56:17,210
Dogs can eat carrots and a bunch of 
other shit like dogs eat things.

1366
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:18,383
You can eat.
Dogs can eat some grains and potatoes 

1367
00:56:19,911 --> 00:56:21,050
and stuff like that.
It's fine for them.

1368
00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:24,850
They mostly eat meat,
like dogs are mostly carnivores,

1369
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:28,180
but they can mix their diet up a little 
bit and still be okay.

1370
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:29,570
Not cats.
You,

1371
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:32,860
you fucking start feeding cats beats and
vegetables and shit like that.

1372
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:36,100
They bit.
This chick came after you.

1373
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:37,353
I'll show you.
I don't want to do the because it's on 

1374
00:56:38,291 --> 00:56:39,124
my next netflix special,
but it's like someone got mad at me 

1375
00:56:42,521 --> 00:56:44,620
because I posted a picture of some meat 
on instagram.

1376
00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:45,850
It's based on the total truth

1377
00:56:45,850 --> 00:56:47,710
store and it was one of the vegan cat 
ladies.

1378
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:48,550
Yeah.
Yeah.

1379
00:56:48,550 --> 00:56:49,383
Just fucking pitch.
So I don't want to ruin it for the 

1380
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,033
adult,
but it's just the community of people 

1381
00:56:54,671 --> 00:56:58,440
that that feed their cats vegan food,
they are fucking completely there.

1382
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:00,340
They're like next level,
crazy,

1383
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:03,310
like if you talk vegans are crazy.
They're like,

1384
00:57:03,311 --> 00:57:05,230
well,
we're taking the shit to the next level.

1385
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:08,020
It's like there's levels to everything.
You know,

1386
00:57:08,021 --> 00:57:09,550
like this,
like you were talking about your gym.

1387
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:10,413
There's guys that are just tough guys.
They don't really want to fight these 

1388
00:57:11,981 --> 00:57:12,814
guys who will want to fight and the 
fight in the amateurs and then there's 

1389
00:57:14,621 --> 00:57:18,100
cody garbrandt.
She's the cody garbrandt,

1390
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:23,040
have a vegan,
vegan activists level of crazy.

1391
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:27,030
I went to his,
he was a month or so ago,

1392
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:29,720
man,
I would like to come on.

1393
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,990
It was great.
That was the first guy I went live.

1394
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:33,520
I sat down.
It was,

1395
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:35,440
it was great.
I was laughing my ass off.

1396
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:36,940
Sacramento's fun,
man.

1397
00:57:36,941 --> 00:57:38,140
They came out.
It was a good time.

1398
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,090
I always love performing there.
Ever since.

1399
00:57:40,091 --> 00:57:42,490
Back in the little comedy club there,
the punchline,

1400
00:57:42,491 --> 00:57:44,230
sacramento,
it's great spot.

1401
00:57:44,790 --> 00:57:46,690
It's a great little spot.
I went up there.

1402
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:49,060
Craig robinson was in town and he's my 
buddy.

1403
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:52,330
He's a good dude and he pulled me up on 
stage that have me do something.

1404
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:55,360
Fucking shit it up the place.
Pretty bad.

1405
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:00,610
Craig bring his music up there,

1406
00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:04,240
but it saved me a little bit because 
he's brought me all right.

1407
00:58:04,241 --> 00:58:05,700
I wouldn't bring my boy up,
blah blah.

1408
00:58:05,701 --> 00:58:07,640
And I got up there on stage and then,
uh,

1409
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:08,993
and so I'm like,
my manager kind of like gave me a heads 

1410
00:58:11,361 --> 00:58:12,860
up,
like craig might pull you up there.

1411
00:58:12,861 --> 00:58:14,100
So I had like,
like,

1412
00:58:14,110 --> 00:58:14,943
all right,
well I just told the story that the 

1413
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:18,700
chick that knocked on my door and came 
and shit all over them.

1414
00:58:20,350 --> 00:58:22,940
I did that,
but I had craig do sound effects for it.

1415
00:58:22,941 --> 00:58:24,140
So I was like,
hey man,

1416
00:58:24,141 --> 00:58:25,880
I'll do this,
but you gotta give me a sound effects.

1417
00:58:25,890 --> 00:58:26,780
He was on her sing,
like,

1418
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:27,813
like,
then she took a massive shit and he's 

1419
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:31,130
like,
you know,

1420
00:58:31,131 --> 00:58:32,810
doing it on the,
on the key word.

1421
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:34,620
This was like new year's,
right?

1422
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:36,390
SoMeone broke in your house.

1423
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:38,230
It was just a saturday night.
I mean,

1424
00:58:38,231 --> 00:58:42,130
this was on new year's.
I'm more known for,

1425
00:58:42,131 --> 00:58:44,560
uh,
for this lady shitting in my head,

1426
00:58:44,630 --> 00:58:46,590
my bed,
my bedroom or my bath.

1427
00:58:46,591 --> 00:58:49,420
And then fucking most things I've done 
in my life for myself.

1428
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:51,400
Well,
you told a story somewhere.

1429
00:58:51,401 --> 00:58:55,000
I took a video of it on snapchat and I'm
like,

1430
00:58:55,001 --> 00:58:56,160
dude,
this is still open.

1431
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:57,650
Yeah,
it's probably up.

1432
00:58:58,170 --> 00:58:59,170
Well,
tmz,

1433
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:03,340
tmz did it and did a story on it and 
they did an interview and they showed my

1434
00:59:03,341 --> 00:59:04,174
whole thing and I actually like got a 
picture of the cic opened the door and 

1435
00:59:08,861 --> 00:59:13,861
there's like a canoe of shit between her
legs and she's sitting in vomit and shit

1436
00:59:14,231 --> 00:59:17,590
half in the toilet,
half on the floor in my brand new house.

1437
00:59:17,591 --> 00:59:22,190
I just spent a whole year building it,
me and my dad and she just tries

1438
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:24,770
to get in your house.
What happened was the store the door,

1439
00:59:24,771 --> 00:59:26,330
like an idiot.
So.

1440
00:59:26,331 --> 00:59:27,164
Okay.
So I'm sitting there with my buddy 

1441
00:59:27,711 --> 00:59:30,530
virgil and his girlfriend.
It's like 1:00

1442
00:59:30,531 --> 00:59:33,630
on a saturday,
we're just kicking it bs and yeah,

1443
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:37,340
it's like a side piece you.
He doesn't put that in there.

1444
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:38,810
No,
come on.

1445
00:59:39,590 --> 00:59:42,920
So then I hear a little knock,
I thought and I'm like,

1446
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:47,220
someone knock on the door and then it 
goes away and I hear again and I'm like,

1447
00:59:47,230 --> 00:59:48,063
I think somebody is knocking.
So I go in and literally I opened the 

1448
00:59:51,351 --> 00:59:56,351
door like this and I got this plump like
24 year old fucking drunk as shit woman,

1449
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:03,170
like leaning against the door,
like looking at me and I opened the door

1450
01:00:03,171 --> 01:00:05,930
and she just walks in and I'm like,
can I help you?

1451
01:00:05,931 --> 01:00:08,890
And she's got a little boiler.
Is that her in the background now?

1452
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:11,360
That's my buddy.
virgil's ex girlfriend.

1453
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:13,620
Oh dude,
this is great.

1454
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:15,173
This is kind of strange.
Just send the case walks in your house 

1455
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:27,180
and then it goes into the bass.
You walks in my house and I'm like,

1456
01:00:27,181 --> 01:00:30,600
can I help you?
Most thing I've ever seen him already.

1457
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:39,270
So she was passed out in shit and piss

1458
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:41,020
your bathrooms.
So.

1459
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:44,650
So I opened the door and she stumbles in
like all chubby and,

1460
01:00:45,090 --> 01:00:48,630
and like a boiler hanging out fucking 
ambulance,

1461
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:49,493
firetruck,
swat team to come get this chick out of 

1462
01:00:51,601 --> 01:00:54,460
my toilet.
And so she walks in and walks,

1463
01:00:54,461 --> 01:00:55,560
dress,
I'm not going to help you.

1464
01:00:55,770 --> 01:00:56,850
And she just keeps on walking.
I'm like,

1465
01:00:56,851 --> 01:00:57,684
excuse me?
And she like walks the end of my house 

1466
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:04,140
and just locks herself in the bathroom.
Is that her right there?

1467
01:01:04,570 --> 01:01:05,403
Uh,
yeah.

1468
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:09,300
Just sitting on the stoop.
This is after she wiped up.

1469
01:01:09,330 --> 01:01:10,470
Yeah.
oh jesus.

1470
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:11,490
She didn't wipe up.

1471
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:19,210
That's the christ itself.
Jesus christ.

1472
01:01:19,741 --> 01:01:20,574
She missed everything.
It's weird that she knew exactly where 

1473
01:01:23,371 --> 01:01:28,371
that bathroom is at.
I've just sat them bath.

1474
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:33,030
It was not there.
The heroes.

1475
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:35,140
Had she ever been over your house for a 
party or something?

1476
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:37,170
No.
So she just was in the neighborhood.

1477
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,033
So I live on a corner and there's maybe 
there's maybe like it comes to truth 

1478
01:01:41,610 --> 01:01:44,790
locked down.
There's a bar called,

1479
01:01:44,791 --> 01:01:47,800
uh,
called uh,

1480
01:01:48,130 --> 01:01:49,290
uh,
cheaters,

1481
01:01:49,650 --> 01:01:52,680
I think she was drunk from that walk in 
and had it really take a shit.

1482
01:01:52,681 --> 01:01:54,510
There's a bar called cheaters.
Yeah.

1483
01:01:54,890 --> 01:01:59,390
Because it's kind of like the ashley 
madison and bars go there to hook.

1484
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:00,420
Yeah,
of course.

1485
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:01,283
Of course.
Yeah.

1486
01:02:01,670 --> 01:02:06,450
I really wouldn't go there.
So anyways,

1487
01:02:09,210 --> 01:02:12,240
if you go to that bar,
look like you know what's going on.

1488
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:17,360
Oh,
it's an old ass like bar in east sac,

1489
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:20,220
which is like the nice little

1490
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:22,740
neighborhood.
And it's like a shitty dive bar,

1491
01:02:22,741 --> 01:02:25,140
so I don't know what it's all about.
The dude's name is cheater.

1492
01:02:25,790 --> 01:02:29,540
It's probably cheaters bar man.
About cheating and cheating.

1493
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:30,960
Names.
Cheater.

1494
01:02:31,870 --> 01:02:35,880
They're cheaters theaters now.
Maybe it's cheaters.

1495
01:02:36,050 --> 01:02:37,680
It's on 34th.
And folsom.

1496
01:02:37,770 --> 01:02:42,120
Is there a posture fee after the are no 
cheaters.

1497
01:02:42,121 --> 01:02:43,760
Okay.
Yeah,

1498
01:02:43,770 --> 01:02:45,270
look at that.
It looks angry.

1499
01:02:46,850 --> 01:02:47,683
Fuck up.
So this is right doWn the street from 

1500
01:02:49,341 --> 01:02:50,280
your house that,
that,

1501
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:52,770
that bathroom was not there before I got
the house.

1502
01:02:52,771 --> 01:02:53,604
I added that on,
poured a slab and built back and 

1503
01:02:55,111 --> 01:02:58,230
everything else.
And so I don't know how the hell she,

1504
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:01,800
she dead ended in the end of the house 
and just took a left.

1505
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:02,993
so she just got lucky.
I found the bathroom shit all over the 

1506
01:03:05,041 --> 01:03:07,320
place.
Did you ever contact her afterwards?

1507
01:03:07,321 --> 01:03:08,360
Did you ever lie?
No.

1508
01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:10,110
She ever contact you and say,
hey,

1509
01:03:10,111 --> 01:03:11,520
I'm sorry.
Shit all over your house.

1510
01:03:11,950 --> 01:03:15,900
Like she's got to know that it was on 
tmz and all these different websites.

1511
01:03:15,910 --> 01:03:19,020
I think she reached out.
Think again,

1512
01:03:19,350 --> 01:03:22,440
we cut that one off.
Girl gets into a 12 step program.

1513
01:03:22,441 --> 01:03:23,274
You will be one of the first people she 
apologized to say I gotta make it right 

1514
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:27,570
with all the people that are wrong in 
the past.

1515
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:28,733
If she's,
she's someone in the neighborhood and I 

1516
01:03:30,881 --> 01:03:35,050
don't know,
but the truth is like she went into that

1517
01:03:35,051 --> 01:03:36,490
bathroom,
like she was just drawn,

1518
01:03:36,491 --> 01:03:38,370
like how could she,
could she have known

1519
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:40,130
if you know my house.
That's what I'm saying.

1520
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:44,690
I always ask them too much.
This guy,

1521
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:49,510
mexican guy that was working for me and 
he had an issue.

1522
01:03:49,511 --> 01:03:50,344
He,
he would do the lacquer on all my 

1523
01:03:51,371 --> 01:03:52,204
cabinets and everything and so he took 
like an extra month and he would get in 

1524
01:03:56,741 --> 01:03:57,574
there and I go into the house.
It was being built and he'd be passed 

1525
01:04:00,221 --> 01:04:01,330
out on the,
on the floor.

1526
01:04:01,331 --> 01:04:03,610
He'd just get high as fuck and like pass
out.

1527
01:04:03,611 --> 01:04:05,710
MY theory was maybe he,
when he was,

1528
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:07,540
he was like,
stay the night at the house,

1529
01:04:07,541 --> 01:04:08,374
the house under construction.
Maybe He was having this chubby check 

1530
01:04:11,330 --> 01:04:12,163
come over or something

1531
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:18,100
semester I man passing off to a mexican.
It's just not how you doing.

1532
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:23,630
Let's change the subject that's move on 
from the phantom shitter,

1533
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:24,813
like team alpha male in sacramento.
You guys are like one of the real super 

1534
01:04:27,481 --> 01:04:28,314
camps in the world.
Like there's like a handful of super 

1535
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:31,620
camp says country,
right?

1536
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,810
There's like a tt,
you know,

1537
01:04:33,811 --> 01:04:36,280
there's a duke roufus,
there's for us,

1538
01:04:36,281 --> 01:04:36,811
uh,
hobbies,

1539
01:04:36,811 --> 01:04:37,970
camp,
tristar,

1540
01:04:38,130 --> 01:04:43,130
aka there's a bunch of super camps.
Do you try to pay attention to how other

1541
01:04:43,561 --> 01:04:45,860
guys are running their stuff and try to 
figure out what,

1542
01:04:45,930 --> 01:04:49,740
what they're incorporating as far as 
like strength and conditioning,

1543
01:04:49,741 --> 01:04:53,010
you know,
rehab places like physical,

1544
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:54,810
physical therapy,
things on those lInes

1545
01:04:54,940 --> 01:04:56,080
a little bit.
You know,

1546
01:04:56,530 --> 01:04:57,363
we have a reputation for whenever we go 
somewhere and going into the gyms and 

1547
01:05:01,301 --> 01:05:02,680
trying to get it rolling,
you know,

1548
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:04,910
testing yourself against other people.
Like,

1549
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:07,360
like kind of an open door policy at our 
place too.

1550
01:05:07,361 --> 01:05:09,790
Like if somebody wants to come in they 
can come in and check it out.

1551
01:05:10,060 --> 01:05:14,980
So we've gotten a lot of throughout the 
years a lot of feedback and done her own

1552
01:05:14,981 --> 01:05:15,814
stuff.
But I'm always trying to but not 

1553
01:05:18,221 --> 01:05:19,054
necessarily like.
And we kind of have our own recipe like 

1554
01:05:21,521 --> 01:05:25,150
we ever things that work out regimen and
a lifestyle.

1555
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:26,433
it's like set set programs throughout 
the day and you can kind of make shift 

1556
01:05:30,371 --> 01:05:31,204
your own depending on what your coaches 
think you need to do and what you feel 

1557
01:05:32,921 --> 01:05:35,500
and needed to do because there's,
there's,

1558
01:05:35,550 --> 01:05:36,020
you know,
two,

1559
01:05:36,020 --> 01:05:38,440
three practices.
You could hIt a day if you wanted to.

1560
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:40,510
And then there's individual workouts and
they go,

1561
01:05:40,810 --> 01:05:41,643
you know,
some guys do the cryo therapy and then 

1562
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:44,373
they,
they've been doing that suction therapy 

1563
01:05:45,521 --> 01:05:47,680
and they've been doing that.
The cup stuff,

1564
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:48,690
cupping.
I don't,

1565
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:50,500
I'm like,
I'm like old school,

1566
01:05:50,501 --> 01:05:51,334
like I don't really believe in.
I'm not like looking for all these 

1567
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:57,220
little secret things to do but have 
never done those things.

1568
01:05:57,221 --> 01:05:58,780
Help.
Something's got to help.

1569
01:05:58,781 --> 01:06:00,730
A little like cryo helps.
Do you do that at all?

1570
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:03,400
I've done it a couple times.
You're not like,

1571
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:07,210
it's not a thing that I'm adamant about 
that I think is good,

1572
01:06:07,510 --> 01:06:08,343
which I would've liked to do more of 
throughout my career is the hyperbaric 

1573
01:06:10,631 --> 01:06:14,050
chambers that after the aldo fight,
right with your leg,

1574
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:18,160
with after the aldo fight,
after the Mike Brown fight,

1575
01:06:18,161 --> 01:06:21,070
like you broke your hand,
broke my hand and had surgery.

1576
01:06:21,430 --> 01:06:22,263
Like,
I mean I would use that just as regular 

1577
01:06:24,521 --> 01:06:24,640
bit.

1578
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:25,473
And then tj dillashaw actually got one 
and had it at his house in his garage 

1579
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:32,350
brewing like in sacramento.
He and he had like a certified,

1580
01:06:32,351 --> 01:06:34,550
him and his wife got certified to do it 
and,

1581
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:36,250
and he would just like chilling that 
thing.

1582
01:06:36,251 --> 01:06:37,084
Oh,
so what does the hyperbaric chamber 

1583
01:06:37,961 --> 01:06:41,440
dude,
it's like oxygen rich environment,

1584
01:06:41,441 --> 01:06:41,940
right?
Yeah.

1585
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:45,730
So it's high oxygen rich environment.
So it basically like it can,

1586
01:06:45,731 --> 01:06:46,564
like,
it does like the same thing that red 

1587
01:06:47,970 --> 01:06:51,370
blood cells to do like transport things 
to,

1588
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:53,590
to your body fat and help you heal 
faster.

1589
01:06:53,591 --> 01:06:57,870
So like there's high altitude which 
helps you get acclimated and,

1590
01:06:57,900 --> 01:06:58,800
and,
and,

1591
01:06:59,290 --> 01:07:00,123
and make more blood cells yourself.
And this is just like helping pass 

1592
01:07:03,851 --> 01:07:04,684
things through.
It's like a hyper oxygenated 

1593
01:07:06,610 --> 01:07:07,810
environment.
What do you,

1594
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:10,780
what do you feel like it did for you?
It healed me faster,

1595
01:07:10,781 --> 01:07:12,490
so that's the first that I never.

1596
01:07:12,490 --> 01:07:15,190
I never been like a big strength and 
conditioning guy even in,

1597
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:16,300
in,
in wrestling,

1598
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:20,500
in college because I was always cutting 
weight so I felt like,

1599
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:22,690
like,
you know,

1600
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:24,850
I've always been really strong for my 
size.

1601
01:07:24,851 --> 01:07:27,340
It wasn't one of my tHings that I needed
to work on necessarily.

1602
01:07:27,341 --> 01:07:30,580
I was working on technique or working on
this or fluidity or whatever.

1603
01:07:30,850 --> 01:07:32,670
So I started.
When I broke my hands,

1604
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:36,550
I started doing a heavy lifting regimen.
I used to not like to do lifts,

1605
01:07:36,570 --> 01:07:37,403
like squats and stuff like that because 
I would get so sore I couldn't do all 

1606
01:07:39,101 --> 01:07:42,490
the shit I like to do like wrestle and 
run and things like that.

1607
01:07:42,820 --> 01:07:43,653
So I was going to heal my hand while I 
was doing these heavy workouts with my 

1608
01:07:46,391 --> 01:07:47,970
trainer.
Kept asking me like,

1609
01:07:48,250 --> 01:07:49,270
am I sore?
And I was like,

1610
01:07:49,271 --> 01:07:50,104
no,
I'm not sore.

1611
01:07:50,290 --> 01:07:52,810
We finally put it together because of 
the hyperbaric chamber.

1612
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:56,140
Like I was like hyper healing.
It was like,

1613
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:57,393
like I would do a hard,
hard workout and never get sore because 

1614
01:07:59,411 --> 01:08:02,200
I would go into the oxygen chamber.
My schedule just worked out.

1615
01:08:02,201 --> 01:08:04,510
I was going in there quick.
Huh?

1616
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,880
That's interesting.
Is there any downside to doing it?

1617
01:08:07,410 --> 01:08:08,510
No,
there's no.

1618
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:09,413
Well the downside is it's expensive and 
that's the same reason why insurance 

1619
01:08:14,930 --> 01:08:16,220
didn't,
didn't

1620
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:17,840
pass it to,
to be insured.

1621
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:18,913
So like there was a session and it can 
be as much as 200 bucks and I a session 

1622
01:08:23,590 --> 01:08:25,490
for an hour.
And how many sessions were you doing?

1623
01:08:26,690 --> 01:08:29,870
I would get it to where I was doing,
you know,

1624
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:32,570
like four sessions a week.
Dammit.

1625
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:35,720
Insurance wasn't paying for this know.
Ufc would pay for it.

1626
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:37,310
Oh,
that's nice.

1627
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:39,500
Yeah.
That's so like,

1628
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:40,700
is this something they have set up at 
the.

1629
01:08:40,701 --> 01:08:42,920
You have the new ufc performance center?

1630
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:44,553
I think they have a,
all that stuff there and I know the 

1631
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:49,540
underground treadmills,
the high altitude a building.

1632
01:08:49,541 --> 01:08:52,450
I've used their pet a couple of times.
I'm just,

1633
01:08:52,510 --> 01:08:55,450
we have a very fortunate with russ back 
in sacramento,

1634
01:08:55,451 --> 01:08:59,290
eldorado hills that he does all that.
I use hyperbaric chamber as well.

1635
01:08:59,350 --> 01:09:01,740
I had the whole whole last year.
You know what?

1636
01:09:01,741 --> 01:09:05,710
Sometimes you kick someone wrong angles 
messed up for two,

1637
01:09:05,711 --> 01:09:06,544
three days.
I would go on there that day and 

1638
01:09:07,811 --> 01:09:10,450
literally you could put weight on it and
move around and be fine.

1639
01:09:10,710 --> 01:09:14,550
What they use it for his brain trauma.
It helps heal your brain.

1640
01:09:14,551 --> 01:09:17,820
Like they'll play your ons and yeah,
it's the same thing that they do for the

1641
01:09:17,821 --> 01:09:20,310
bends.
When somebody goes and does deep sea and

1642
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:23,100
they.
They feel like deep sea diving,

1643
01:09:23,340 --> 01:09:24,173
they have to put them in a hyperbaric 
chamber to like acclimate them to like 

1644
01:09:28,110 --> 01:09:28,943
heal them from coming up too fast.
I mean there's like a real science 

1645
01:09:31,711 --> 01:09:33,060
behind it.
It's no.

1646
01:09:33,061 --> 01:09:35,140
I've heard about people using it for 
breaks,

1647
01:09:35,350 --> 01:09:38,100
bone breaks and having some really quick
recovery.

1648
01:09:38,420 --> 01:09:40,530
I've just never experienced it.
You should do it.

1649
01:09:40,750 --> 01:09:41,583
I feel like why would.
I would imagine it'd be just a good 

1650
01:09:42,901 --> 01:09:43,734
thing to do all the time,
but I wonder if there's any negative 

1651
01:09:45,271 --> 01:09:47,490
effects.
I don't think there is,

1652
01:09:47,491 --> 01:09:48,930
I mean,
you know,

1653
01:09:48,931 --> 01:09:49,421
they're,
they're,

1654
01:09:49,421 --> 01:09:54,120
they're doing it for autistic kids,
for people with lyme disease.

1655
01:09:54,150 --> 01:09:56,280
Lyme disease is a big one.
She uses.

1656
01:09:56,281 --> 01:09:57,510
that stuff's scary.
Yeah.

1657
01:09:57,570 --> 01:09:58,403
There's so many fucking people that have
that and don't even know you're tired 

1658
01:10:00,410 --> 01:10:01,243
all the time and broken down.
They don't understand that their immune 

1659
01:10:03,361 --> 01:10:05,760
system is devastated by ticks.
Yeah.

1660
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:08,720
There's a thing called the rocky 
mountain tick,

1661
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,130
rocky mountain flee or something like 
that.

1662
01:10:11,490 --> 01:10:13,290
I think it's rocky mount,
but uh,

1663
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,420
there's a um.
Oh no,

1664
01:10:15,450 --> 01:10:17,310
that's not it.
It's the lone star tick.

1665
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:18,413
There's a disease that people are 
getting that makes you allergic to red 

1666
01:10:21,871 --> 01:10:23,280
meat.
Huh?

1667
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:25,980
And then getting it from ticks.
That's a trip.

1668
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:27,233
You take a tick bite and you don't 
realize anything even happened and you 

1669
01:10:30,391 --> 01:10:32,220
go to eat meat,
like you cheeseburger,

1670
01:10:32,230 --> 01:10:34,890
something to get really sick.
Your immune system gets devastated.

1671
01:10:34,891 --> 01:10:35,724
There it is.
The lone star tick injects alpha gal 

1672
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:38,933
into the bloodstream and then the immune
system releases immunoglobulin e 

1673
01:10:42,511 --> 01:10:46,290
antibodies to fight this foreign sugar.
After this reaction,

1674
01:10:46,291 --> 01:10:47,124
the future intake of mammal meet with 
the same alpha gal will result in an 

1675
01:10:51,150 --> 01:10:56,150
allergy reaction because meat has,
it's like alpha go lactose.

1676
01:10:57,210 --> 01:11:01,200
They're saying alpha gal as short.
But I forget what it actually is.

1677
01:11:02,490 --> 01:11:03,780
I forgot the actual.
Uh,

1678
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:05,580
so does It.
Does it say there?

1679
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:07,050
Yeah.
Galactose.

1680
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:09,060
Alpha one.
Three.

1681
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:12,770
Galactose.
So that's the shit that lives in later.

1682
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:14,793
Tigers

1683
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:17,850
shit bro.
You do a podcast every day,

1684
01:11:17,851 --> 01:11:21,530
three hours ago and learn something,
but it's been around for shit.

1685
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:22,650
But that's fucked up,
right.

1686
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:24,450
Chad mendez.
Got that?

1687
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:26,860
Uh,
he'd be devastated that man.

1688
01:11:27,210 --> 01:11:31,660
Make sure you got that stuff on.
You just can't see chaz vegan.

1689
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:33,870
Well,
you can eat fish.

1690
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:36,090
It's mammal proteins.
You start eating crocodiles.

1691
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:37,680
Crocodiles only.
Yeah.

1692
01:11:37,681 --> 01:11:39,810
So the hyperbaric chambers is a good 
one.

1693
01:11:40,650 --> 01:11:42,180
I've been doing the,
uh,

1694
01:11:42,390 --> 01:11:44,310
the,
the salt.

1695
01:11:44,490 --> 01:11:47,910
What's the thing you've been doing?
Float to do that a long time.

1696
01:11:48,330 --> 01:11:50,490
And they finally got one right next to 
our,

1697
01:11:50,491 --> 01:11:51,324
uh,
uh,

1698
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:53,580
we own the island,
a little vibe.

1699
01:11:53,581 --> 01:11:54,414
Health bar in sacramento,
the liquid and the juice fiber and they 

1700
01:11:57,871 --> 01:12:00,580
have the right next door.
They have that hyper,

1701
01:12:00,930 --> 01:12:03,420
a float center float center,
so I've done that.

1702
01:12:03,421 --> 01:12:05,160
So amazing in it.
It's cool.

1703
01:12:05,161 --> 01:12:05,994
I mean the only problem is I have to 
have a quiet mind enabled to go to get 

1704
01:12:09,601 --> 01:12:10,320
the most out of it.

1705
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:12,510
Like if I'm stressing about something,
I go in there.

1706
01:12:12,930 --> 01:12:16,170
I just like.
I mean I ended up like just thinking the

1707
01:12:16,171 --> 01:12:17,090
whole time,
whatever.

1708
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:18,780
I have to be at a right place to go in 
there.

1709
01:12:18,781 --> 01:12:20,820
I think yeah,
maybe it's a personality thing.

1710
01:12:20,821 --> 01:12:23,190
Like do you.
I mean I like it when I can relax,

1711
01:12:23,191 --> 01:12:25,500
but like if I have like a lot going on 
my mind,

1712
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:30,450
I can't just shut it down and then I'm 
stuck in this like a lingus thinking and

1713
01:12:30,451 --> 01:12:32,400
I can't and I'm like,
I gotta get out of here and go take care

1714
01:12:32,401 --> 01:12:33,330
of this,
take care of that,

1715
01:12:34,110 --> 01:12:35,700
but what I want,
I'm able to chill.

1716
01:12:35,701 --> 01:12:37,650
I love it.
I know cody uses it a lot.

1717
01:12:37,710 --> 01:12:40,410
I use it a lot.
I one time I had a close call,

1718
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:44,840
like a astral projection.
I don't know if it was crazy.

1719
01:12:44,870 --> 01:12:45,703
I went in there.

1720
01:12:46,050 --> 01:12:49,320
Basically it's,
I was explained to the guy that owned it

1721
01:12:49,321 --> 01:12:50,880
at the time because I quit going.
I was like,

1722
01:12:50,881 --> 01:12:54,060
one time it happened,
I feel like grim reaper came over top of

1723
01:12:54,061 --> 01:12:54,730
me.
No shit.

1724
01:12:54,730 --> 01:12:56,310
It was like trying to push me down and 
drown me,

1725
01:12:56,311 --> 01:12:58,800
but I was like sleeping and like a deep 
trance.

1726
01:12:58,801 --> 01:13:02,790
Like I'd always felt like my body would 
vibrate and you're like kept coming.

1727
01:13:02,791 --> 01:13:06,330
I will come back to like the wake,
such an sleep deep trance.

1728
01:13:06,690 --> 01:13:09,690
I come back up and I'd finally calm 
myself back down,

1729
01:13:10,010 --> 01:13:14,030
relaxed and would drift off into the 
float and they bone would come like just

1730
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:17,280
the whole time I could feel that hot 
coils on my back with my face,

1731
01:13:17,281 --> 01:13:18,180
you know,
because it's still,

1732
01:13:18,181 --> 01:13:19,014
you know,
you're just above water around your 

1733
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:21,990
head.
LIke three times.

1734
01:13:21,991 --> 01:13:24,100
I finally got up and I was like,
god,

1735
01:13:24,230 --> 01:13:25,960
I really felt like something was trying 
to do.

1736
01:13:26,010 --> 01:13:26,843
Someone's trying.
I don't know what I was going on and 

1737
01:13:28,261 --> 01:13:31,290
anxiety or something crazy,
crazy.

1738
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:32,293
Wow.
Stop some crazy visions in their last 

1739
01:13:34,550 --> 01:13:36,080
time I was in there.
I just kept the.

1740
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:39,680
It has the blue light in there and I got
the music going and I was just spinning,

1741
01:13:39,850 --> 01:13:42,720
lIke bouncing off this.
I was just staying busy.

1742
01:13:42,721 --> 01:13:46,810
I could chill.
I'm not good at relaxing these days when

1743
01:13:46,850 --> 01:13:47,683
he would say,
I would think you'd be better at 

1744
01:13:48,571 --> 01:13:50,730
relaxing now.
Now that you're retired from fighting.

1745
01:13:50,930 --> 01:13:54,060
Oh no way man.
I have to.

1746
01:13:54,061 --> 01:13:57,500
I'll have to like if jujitsu is going on
and I'm like,

1747
01:13:57,570 --> 01:13:59,730
I'll have to like stop and be like,
look guys,

1748
01:14:00,330 --> 01:14:01,830
we're having a meeting right now.
I go,

1749
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:04,890
let's cover this over like jujitsu 
started 20 minutes ago.

1750
01:14:04,891 --> 01:14:07,140
I need to get that workout in.
Otherwise I'm like,

1751
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:08,191
you know,
you know,

1752
01:14:08,191 --> 01:14:12,250
you create yourself a regimen throughout
your life of working out a couple times

1753
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:13,083
a day and that's what you do.
And then you go in and try to have 

1754
01:14:14,501 --> 01:14:15,334
meetings all day and,
and like this and put this fire out and 

1755
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:19,954
get on this call.
And it's like I was doing that together 

1756
01:14:22,601 --> 01:14:23,434
with being a full time athlete.
So finding the balance has been the key 

1757
01:14:26,081 --> 01:14:26,600
for me.

1758
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:27,433
Well for you there,
there probably Is like a requirement 

1759
01:14:29,001 --> 01:14:31,370
that your body has to like blow out 
stage two

1760
01:14:31,660 --> 01:14:33,640
and that and that's another thing with 
the diet.

1761
01:14:33,641 --> 01:14:38,641
Like he was asking about his diet,
like I had been like an overeater,

1762
01:14:39,731 --> 01:14:41,980
he doesn't like stuff stuff and he was 
calling me,

1763
01:14:42,130 --> 01:14:42,963
you know,
making fun of me for eating all the 

1764
01:14:43,841 --> 01:14:44,674
time.
I'm like just constantly eating and 

1765
01:14:46,241 --> 01:14:49,660
whatnot because I'm used to doing that.
You burn so many calories in the day.

1766
01:14:49,990 --> 01:14:50,823
Now I have to like be mindful of not 
like overeating because I'm not putting 

1767
01:14:54,070 --> 01:14:55,900
out the same thing.
otherwise I feel like crap.

1768
01:14:56,380 --> 01:15:00,010
You don't want your fat tire and you're.
Yeah,

1769
01:15:00,011 --> 01:15:01,990
I mean I'm not worried about getting fat
necessarily.

1770
01:15:01,991 --> 01:15:04,210
It's more of just like feeling like,
shit,

1771
01:15:04,570 --> 01:15:07,540
this guy's coatings the best instigator 
ever.

1772
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:08,621
Whatever.
I'll do it.

1773
01:15:08,621 --> 01:15:11,590
He tries to,
he tries the like accentuated like,

1774
01:15:12,010 --> 01:15:15,070
like if he knows that I'm like man,
I'm a little thick and then they'll wait

1775
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:16,690
like a day and they'd be like,
man,

1776
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:19,830
fabian looking a little bigger.
Just always trying to make

1777
01:15:20,670 --> 01:15:23,130
about 13 percent.
Do you hAve a jujitsu match with paul?

1778
01:15:23,180 --> 01:15:23,860
Yeah,
right?

1779
01:15:23,860 --> 01:15:24,870
Yes.
That's it.

1780
01:15:24,950 --> 01:15:26,930
And you went to a decision with him,
man,

1781
01:15:27,330 --> 01:15:31,020
that's checked six overtime.
That's gigantic.

1782
01:15:31,350 --> 01:15:33,700
That guy is fucking legit,
man.

1783
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:34,553
He's pretty good for garlic.
You didn't specialize in that and 

1784
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:38,610
specialized in mma,
you know,

1785
01:15:38,611 --> 01:15:39,444
and coming from a wrestling background,
obviously you have a grappling 

1786
01:15:41,251 --> 01:15:45,000
background and you were great at 
submissions in your mma career.

1787
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:49,620
But to take on a guy that's like,
that accomplished as a grappler,

1788
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:50,570
that's gigantic.

1789
01:15:50,570 --> 01:15:51,620
Yeah,
it was cool.

1790
01:15:51,621 --> 01:15:52,454
I mean I always tell these guys and I 
actually believe it and that's what I 

1791
01:15:55,671 --> 01:15:58,910
said about connor too,
like you have to in our sport,

1792
01:15:58,911 --> 01:16:01,280
you have to be able to go with a world 
champion,

1793
01:16:01,550 --> 01:16:03,650
jujitsu player,
world champion wrestler,

1794
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:04,713
a world champion judo player,
a world champion boxer and be able to 

1795
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:09,120
hold your own,
you know?

1796
01:16:09,140 --> 01:16:11,390
And that's,
that's the difference with our sport and

1797
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:12,224
that's why it's so impressive.
And so that's what I was saying for 

1798
01:16:14,001 --> 01:16:16,490
these guys and I didn't even for that,
for that.

1799
01:16:16,491 --> 01:16:19,070
I was going to train real hard to take 
it real serious.

1800
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:23,720
But then I got this the rampage movie 
role with in the rocks new movie,

1801
01:16:23,721 --> 01:16:24,554
so I went and spent 10 days in atlanta 
and then I had told Chad before that I 

1802
01:16:28,011 --> 01:16:30,650
would do this charity,
a fishing ship with these,

1803
01:16:31,060 --> 01:16:32,840
you know,
the injured vets.

1804
01:16:32,930 --> 01:16:36,830
And so we did that for three days and I 
went in there looking like a chubby.

1805
01:16:36,831 --> 01:16:39,330
There's a picture of me.
I look so freaking chubby in that,

1806
01:16:39,390 --> 01:16:41,570
in that thing.
And didn't even train,

1807
01:16:41,571 --> 01:16:42,404
but I was like,
you know,

1808
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:43,640
I,
I go,

1809
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:45,920
I take a lot of pride in my grappling 
ability.

1810
01:16:45,921 --> 01:16:46,990
I feel like,
you know,

1811
01:16:47,030 --> 01:16:48,710
I'm one of the best grapplers in the 
sport.

1812
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:51,110
So it was good to go in there and do 
that.

1813
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:52,131
Well,
you know that.

1814
01:16:52,131 --> 01:16:55,700
And Chad beating Jeff Glover,
tapping him.

1815
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:57,900
Yeah,
that's fucking crazy.

1816
01:16:58,230 --> 01:17:01,040
It just shows you the level of grappling
that you guys have at your gym.

1817
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:01,870
I've,
I've,

1818
01:17:01,870 --> 01:17:03,980
I've gone,
like Jeff Glover and I,

1819
01:17:04,310 --> 01:17:05,143
when I first started training,
it makes more storage because I'm from 

1820
01:17:06,711 --> 01:17:09,470
santa barbara with him.
And bill would.

1821
01:17:09,580 --> 01:17:10,880
You're from santa barbara?
Yeah.

1822
01:17:10,910 --> 01:17:12,560
I was born in santa anna,
beLla vista.

1823
01:17:12,610 --> 01:17:14,130
And we have a house in santa barbara.
Yeah.

1824
01:17:14,330 --> 01:17:16,040
I love it up there.
Oh bro,

1825
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:20,090
you got to come stay at my house.
I mean we rent it out right now.

1826
01:17:20,390 --> 01:17:21,440
Barbara.
I'm renting it out.

1827
01:17:21,441 --> 01:17:24,290
It's rented out to a family from Sweden.
But.

1828
01:17:24,370 --> 01:17:25,131
Oh,
come into play.

1829
01:17:25,131 --> 01:17:26,750
I'll hook you up dude.
It's bad.

1830
01:17:26,751 --> 01:17:29,270
You just bring your family up there.
It's like santa barbara is awesome.

1831
01:17:29,330 --> 01:17:30,163
Yeah.
So there's one of the best spots really 

1832
01:17:31,311 --> 01:17:33,500
is one of the best bots.
So what you're saying about Jeff Glover,

1833
01:17:33,501 --> 01:17:35,100
you knew hIm from paragon.
So jay,

1834
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:35,983
I've trained with jeffrey years,
so the paragon used to be like the size 

1835
01:17:39,610 --> 01:17:40,443
two of these tables,
like in a little room and so I would go 

1836
01:17:43,731 --> 01:17:44,564
down and walk down from my uncle's house
and go down to paragon when those guys 

1837
01:17:47,411 --> 01:17:51,580
were just starting and and me and jeff 
who trained together for years and,

1838
01:17:51,710 --> 01:17:53,180
and bill to bill when he.

1839
01:17:53,410 --> 01:17:54,243
Every time they build the grill,
every time I come in there he'd want to 

1840
01:17:56,601 --> 01:17:58,070
go straight,
straight wrestling.

1841
01:17:58,071 --> 01:17:59,510
Like hey,
can we do some take downs?

1842
01:17:59,511 --> 01:18:01,130
Because he was trying to work on that 
part of his game,

1843
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:04,520
but like I've,
I've shamed with sabrina,

1844
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:06,640
I've shamed with hobson,
maura.

1845
01:18:06,650 --> 01:18:07,483
I've trained with glover.
Like when whenever I see somebody that 

1846
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:13,130
they can whoop me in jujitsu,
I'm going with that guy.

1847
01:18:13,131 --> 01:18:13,964
I had hobson come stay at my house.
I go and train with code green all the 

1848
01:18:15,951 --> 01:18:17,780
time.
I had a glover.

1849
01:18:17,781 --> 01:18:18,614
I'd always hit him up and go with them.
So I've been going with this top level 

1850
01:18:20,661 --> 01:18:23,300
guys my whole career.
That's huge though.

1851
01:18:23,450 --> 01:18:27,230
That's shining accomplishment for you 
and even bigger for chat.

1852
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:30,020
Tap glover and it's you to see this guy,
man.

1853
01:18:30,050 --> 01:18:33,380
That's what I'm saying.
I always give you shit.

1854
01:18:33,381 --> 01:18:35,120
I've said it like two or three times 
when I'm like,

1855
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:37,340
I'm like,
let's roll.

1856
01:18:37,850 --> 01:18:38,480
And you're like,
yeah,

1857
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:40,810
you just want her to try to fucking,
you know,

1858
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,710
put it on me and this and that.
And I'm like,

1859
01:18:42,711 --> 01:18:43,544
no,
because you always worried about me and 

1860
01:18:44,781 --> 01:18:46,580
other people's guards.
I said this the other day.

1861
01:18:46,581 --> 01:18:49,100
I'm like,
whenever I read about you and your other

1862
01:18:49,101 --> 01:18:49,934
people,
like cards,

1863
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,230
like in a fight,
I'm commenting,

1864
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:53,113
I'm talking about your coMmentary.
When have I ever been worried about you 

1865
01:18:54,831 --> 01:18:56,750
and someone's card debt?
What's his name?

1866
01:18:56,930 --> 01:18:58,020
Michael mcdonald.
He's like,

1867
01:18:58,040 --> 01:18:59,030
you're right,
michael.

1868
01:18:59,031 --> 01:19:01,220
Mcdonald's got a really good close 
bottom.

1869
01:19:01,221 --> 01:19:05,270
Say that because if I'm looking at a 
fight,

1870
01:19:05,271 --> 01:19:07,220
I'm looking at what?
What's the possibilities here?

1871
01:19:07,250 --> 01:19:09,200
Absolutely.
I'm just fucking with you.

1872
01:19:09,210 --> 01:19:11,480
It does have a good good team from his 
back when you fucked him up.

1873
01:19:11,630 --> 01:19:13,600
He has some good.
He has some good triangles.

1874
01:19:13,610 --> 01:19:14,780
He's got.
He's got good game,

1875
01:19:14,781 --> 01:19:15,890
but it was a big win for you.

1876
01:19:15,980 --> 01:19:17,750
That was a big fight.
That was a good fight.

1877
01:19:17,850 --> 01:19:19,330
Wild.
Yeah.

1878
01:19:19,890 --> 01:19:20,723
That fight.
I mean he was knocking everyone out and 

1879
01:19:23,230 --> 01:19:24,650
yeah,
he's a weird one man.

1880
01:19:24,651 --> 01:19:26,870
Like it stopped because you look at his 
body,

1881
01:19:26,871 --> 01:19:30,050
you think or how is this car or heavy 
puncher and then he just,

1882
01:19:30,170 --> 01:19:31,760
he hits hard fuckers.
Oh,

1883
01:19:31,761 --> 01:19:33,800
you believe it.
It's a weird thing.

1884
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:35,360
Cody's like that.
Look at him.

1885
01:19:35,361 --> 01:19:39,080
All skinny and dopey.
Hit hard.

1886
01:19:40,730 --> 01:19:44,060
I've been given this guy shipped in the 
last few days because it black guy,

1887
01:19:44,470 --> 01:19:47,720
he got a black guy,
he got elva advised by somebody that was

1888
01:19:47,721 --> 01:19:48,554
like covering up,
kinda scared and then he box with my 

1889
01:19:51,261 --> 01:19:53,690
little Joseph Morales who's been with me
since he's nine.

1890
01:19:53,930 --> 01:19:55,520
He's A 25 pounder,
just had his,

1891
01:19:55,790 --> 01:19:58,100
his debut in the ufc and I'm like,
man,

1892
01:19:58,130 --> 01:19:59,840
po po got you with that black guy.
And he's like,

1893
01:19:59,841 --> 01:20:00,280
no,
It was,

1894
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:01,250
it was an elbow.
And I'm like,

1895
01:20:01,251 --> 01:20:02,084
nah man.
It was.

1896
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:05,360
I was getting so busy.
He's like,

1897
01:20:05,390 --> 01:20:07,890
you're going to make it real hard day 
for joseph next time I

1898
01:20:09,540 --> 01:20:10,373
having a bunch of people around you that
fuck with you like that is actually 

1899
01:20:12,931 --> 01:20:17,490
probably good for you when you get into 
a situation with a guy like say dominick

1900
01:20:17,491 --> 01:20:20,370
cruz talks a lot of shit like you're so 
used to it.

1901
01:20:20,371 --> 01:20:22,410
Like that was one of the interesting 
things about that fight.

1902
01:20:22,610 --> 01:20:24,930
You could tell.
You're so used to shit talking.

1903
01:20:24,931 --> 01:20:27,510
It didn't bother you at all.
They get charged you up?

1904
01:20:27,710 --> 01:20:28,950
Yeah,
because he was getting fired up.

1905
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:30,410
Man.
Dom doesn't act like that.

1906
01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:35,420
I like the way he was acting like our 
times that we ran into each other.

1907
01:20:35,431 --> 01:20:36,264
I remember about the ms dot aki fight.
He was talking so much shit about me 

1908
01:20:38,671 --> 01:20:41,510
being fatherless and like crazy.
I'm like,

1909
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:42,993
really?
You could tell her you sat around and 

1910
01:20:44,131 --> 01:20:46,130
tried to research is how he's going to 
talk to you.

1911
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:47,133
I'll do that.
My father was in prison or whatever it 

1912
01:20:48,241 --> 01:20:48,460
might do.

1913
01:20:48,460 --> 01:20:50,940
That's right for you.
It doesn't matter.

1914
01:20:51,270 --> 01:20:54,570
So we go through the.
I'm getting ready to film to walk in the

1915
01:20:54,571 --> 01:20:55,500
fight.
Ms dot garcia at two.

1916
01:20:55,501 --> 01:20:56,334
Oh,
to catch fucking dumb at the corner of 

1917
01:20:58,651 --> 01:20:59,690
my eye.
Like look and look,

1918
01:20:59,710 --> 01:21:00,400
look away.
And I was like,

1919
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:02,310
okay,
I'm going to say something to him now.

1920
01:21:02,311 --> 01:21:05,310
We caught up to him and he's like,
what's up man?

1921
01:21:05,610 --> 01:21:06,690
I was like,
yo,

1922
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:09,220
what's up mami?
As a you're going to talk shit on a tea.

1923
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:12,600
Talk shit on the media about the stupid.
Even saying like,

1924
01:21:12,601 --> 01:21:13,434
I'm going to beat it.
I'm going to not be ms out faster than 

1925
01:21:15,361 --> 01:21:18,150
you did and I'll beat your ass next.
And then I was like,

1926
01:21:18,151 --> 01:21:18,984
look,
I don't slam slamming on the concrete 

1927
01:21:19,830 --> 01:21:22,400
now like biz being and who,
uh,

1928
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:25,230
daniel camaro was right there.
And he's like,

1929
01:21:25,231 --> 01:21:26,064
oh hey,
like,

1930
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:26,690
look back.

1931
01:21:26,690 --> 01:21:27,630
And like,
he's like,

1932
01:21:27,631 --> 01:21:28,291
yeah,
he's like,

1933
01:21:28,291 --> 01:21:31,080
you do have daddy issues,
like said like the off the wall shit.

1934
01:21:31,081 --> 01:21:31,950
Like,
like,

1935
01:21:31,951 --> 01:21:32,460
sorry,
no,

1936
01:21:32,460 --> 01:21:34,020
he's not about it,
but he's a great fighter,

1937
01:21:34,021 --> 01:21:34,854
don't get me wrong.
But when it's in that kind of situation 

1938
01:21:37,130 --> 01:21:37,963
he's not.
I knew he was flight then you knew what 

1939
01:21:40,970 --> 01:21:41,803
the,
that he wasn't about the fighter like 

1940
01:21:43,681 --> 01:21:44,850
any in his,
in his interview with me.

1941
01:21:44,860 --> 01:21:46,920
And he didn't want a bra with you.
Exactly.

1942
01:21:46,930 --> 01:21:47,940
He's,
he's not a fighter.

1943
01:21:47,941 --> 01:21:50,370
He's an athlete and he's good at.
He's at what he does.

1944
01:21:50,371 --> 01:21:53,410
But I knew that he was a different level
mentality one.

1945
01:21:53,630 --> 01:21:54,463
But that's a weird statement.
Like the people I've heard people say 

1946
01:21:55,981 --> 01:21:56,521
that before.
I,

1947
01:21:56,521 --> 01:21:58,500
like he's an athlete,
he's not a fighter,

1948
01:21:58,530 --> 01:22:00,750
but if he's fighting,
he's a fighter.

1949
01:22:00,930 --> 01:22:02,250
Like,
so what's the difference?

1950
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:03,370
Yeah,
I think.

1951
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:08,410
I think dominic actually showed like,
I think he got to brave with cody.

1952
01:22:08,620 --> 01:22:10,090
There's a couple times where he's like,
all right,

1953
01:22:10,091 --> 01:22:10,924
I'm going to get in there and show them 
I can hit hard and it got them in 

1954
01:22:13,271 --> 01:22:15,610
trouble in that fight.
I think he's a fighter.

1955
01:22:15,690 --> 01:22:16,523
I,
I know what he's talking about with 

1956
01:22:17,231 --> 01:22:18,064
athletes that are,
that are more athletes and less of a 

1957
01:22:19,841 --> 01:22:20,674
fighter.
Like people say that a lot about george 

1958
01:22:21,851 --> 01:22:23,170
st pierre.
Yes.

1959
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:24,033
Like I don't know if george st pierre 
loves a good nasty like knock down drag 

1960
01:22:29,101 --> 01:22:33,220
out.
I know tj dillashaw like loves can't.

1961
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:35,800
He likes to get punched in the face and 
putting fuel back.

1962
01:22:35,801 --> 01:22:38,230
Cody garbrandt will stand there and like
if he gets punished,

1963
01:22:38,530 --> 01:22:41,620
he'll marsh guys down with his face down
and like tell him to hit him again.

1964
01:22:42,130 --> 01:22:44,950
There's those kind of people that love a
fucking,

1965
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:48,760
like a grinding fight whether he's going
to do it all the time or not,

1966
01:22:48,761 --> 01:22:49,594
but like they have an affinity for it.
Like they enjoy it and then some people 

1967
01:22:53,171 --> 01:22:57,310
that are like playing a sport consider 
themselves tough and don't,

1968
01:22:57,880 --> 01:22:59,140
don't like that kind of.

1969
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:00,060
Yeah.
It's interesting.

1970
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:02,440
Rumble said that about himself.
Rumble johnson said,

1971
01:23:02,470 --> 01:23:03,850
I'm an athlete.
He goes,

1972
01:23:03,851 --> 01:23:05,620
I'm not a fighter.
I'm just really at it.

1973
01:23:06,310 --> 01:23:08,260
I thought it was crazy.
Yeah,

1974
01:23:09,130 --> 01:23:10,660
you chewing over there,
so what's going on?

1975
01:23:10,750 --> 01:23:11,920
You guys too.
And tobacco.

1976
01:23:12,010 --> 01:23:12,843
Can you drinking?
You're spitting and just had a louis 

1977
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:17,640
man.
Oh shoot.

1978
01:23:17,650 --> 01:23:18,483
I don't have any vices.
I thought you were getting into that 

1979
01:23:20,081 --> 01:23:20,950
now.
Fuck

1980
01:23:21,970 --> 01:23:22,803
that.
That fight leading up with dominic was 

1981
01:23:23,881 --> 01:23:25,770
everyone thought I was,
you know,

1982
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:28,350
the emotional one or the way that he was
acting.

1983
01:23:28,351 --> 01:23:28,681
I was like,
man,

1984
01:23:28,681 --> 01:23:29,700
this is going to be easy.
Fight for me.

1985
01:23:30,090 --> 01:23:30,923
Right?
Because it was out of out of not like 

1986
01:23:33,910 --> 01:23:36,730
dominic do that while you were a big 
threat.

1987
01:23:37,090 --> 01:23:38,300
That's probably what it was.
Right.

1988
01:23:38,410 --> 01:23:39,243
I gave dominic cra credit because I know
that dom knew that was going to be a 

1989
01:23:41,861 --> 01:23:43,000
hard fight.
Yeah.

1990
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:44,290
Oh yeah.
He said it.

1991
01:23:44,291 --> 01:23:44,891
I said,
hey bro,

1992
01:23:44,891 --> 01:23:45,724
thanks for giving,
for choosing the harder route in and 

1993
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:49,473
talking up the fact that cody cody's the
next guy because he went for the 

1994
01:23:52,751 --> 01:23:54,850
toughest fight coders until he knew that

1995
01:23:55,300 --> 01:23:56,290
yeah,
he came to the fight,

1996
01:23:56,291 --> 01:23:57,970
you know,
I know he got here.

1997
01:23:57,971 --> 01:23:59,170
He got busted,
he was leaking.

1998
01:23:59,171 --> 01:24:01,750
I mean it's,
I was completely gassed and he was still

1999
01:24:01,751 --> 01:24:02,471
fighting,
like come on,

2000
01:24:02,471 --> 01:24:03,304
you know,
talking,

2001
01:24:03,430 --> 01:24:04,263
but all the way up to that,
to that point where I had kicked them 

2002
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:09,460
and split them open and uh,
he was talking shit back to me.

2003
01:24:09,461 --> 01:24:10,211
It was funny.
I was like,

2004
01:24:10,211 --> 01:24:10,840
he's like,
well,

2005
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:12,040
you little bitch.
I didn't hurt.

2006
01:24:12,041 --> 01:24:12,874
Like I was laughing,
like,

2007
01:24:12,910 --> 01:24:13,800
oh,
don't lie,

2008
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:14,960
don't lie to me.
I know that haven't got,

2009
01:24:14,970 --> 01:24:16,090
you know.
So it was fun.

2010
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:19,780
Lego was figuring them out but still 
like talking shit to each other and then

2011
01:24:19,781 --> 01:24:21,460
going in and it was great because I'm 
like,

2012
01:24:21,461 --> 01:24:23,770
this is the guy that I pictured fighting
since I was a teenager,

2013
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:25,840
you know,
and got prepared for him.

2014
01:24:25,870 --> 01:24:26,770
He's,
you know,

2015
01:24:26,890 --> 01:24:28,450
you said once he hit that he stopped.

2016
01:24:28,750 --> 01:24:29,910
So exactly.
Once we're.

2017
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:32,290
He was,
every time I'd hit him or he,

2018
01:24:32,350 --> 01:24:34,380
I hit him with a good shot or he thought
he'd get me with one good.

2019
01:24:34,390 --> 01:24:37,960
We'd go back and forth until I had 
kicked him and my knee hit him.

2020
01:24:37,961 --> 01:24:40,720
And then he came back up and I saw him 
like,

2021
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,430
he a great poker face.
Man,

2022
01:24:42,431 --> 01:24:43,720
he's tough.
He knows how to,

2023
01:24:43,721 --> 01:24:44,860
you know,
when he's hurting,

2024
01:24:44,890 --> 01:24:46,840
he keeps it going.
But his eyes,

2025
01:24:46,970 --> 01:24:50,230
he looked at the button like I saw his 
pupils go really big and I was,

2026
01:24:50,231 --> 01:24:51,580
hey don,
you having fun yet?

2027
01:24:51,910 --> 01:24:54,630
And he didn't answer back.
I was a great thing like that.

2028
01:24:54,660 --> 01:24:57,100
The third round it was,
I knew that I was okay,

2029
01:24:57,101 --> 01:24:59,440
if I just keep doing what I'm doing,
I'm going to win this fight,

2030
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:01,740
you know,
end up catching them or you know,

2031
01:25:01,830 --> 01:25:02,663
it's my fight as long as I don't get 
caught with something because he throws 

2032
01:25:04,450 --> 01:25:07,210
looping punches and kicks and he's very 
unorthodox.

2033
01:25:07,810 --> 01:25:09,490
But I knew right then after that he was 
like,

2034
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:10,280
oh shit,

2035
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:11,113
this is an interesting fight coming up 
for you to be fucking tj after training 

2036
01:25:13,651 --> 01:25:16,010
with them for so long and all the bad 
blood that you guys have.

2037
01:25:16,050 --> 01:25:18,650
Tj leaving the team and going to train 
with duane.

2038
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:22,470
Not so much about the team.
There's a lot of confusion about what,

2039
01:25:22,590 --> 01:25:23,700
what,
what went down.

2040
01:25:23,701 --> 01:25:24,534
And it's,
it's fun for people because tj trained 

2041
01:25:26,881 --> 01:25:28,920
with you guys for a long time.
Here's,

2042
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:29,873
if I send you a text,
I'll say the four minute video of him 

2043
01:25:32,221 --> 01:25:37,221
explaining exactly what happened,
which is know you don't have to do that,

2044
01:25:37,321 --> 01:25:41,310
but you tell me from your point of view.
So tj left the team,

2045
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:43,410
like said,
hey look,

2046
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:45,173
I first off it was,
it was a timed on ultimate fighter with 

2047
01:25:49,351 --> 01:25:51,190
connor with,
with the company.

2048
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:54,390
He came from that because he was there 
and that's when we were defending them.

2049
01:25:54,391 --> 01:25:57,330
That's why I'm kind of like took it to 
because he's like,

2050
01:25:57,331 --> 01:25:59,930
I'm all about loyalty and like we don't 
do that shit.

2051
01:26:00,150 --> 01:26:03,000
I never really liked dwayne,
especially when he left because he was a

2052
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:04,220
guy

2053
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:06,680
and like it was always about money and 
weird things,

2054
01:26:06,681 --> 01:26:07,430
et cetera,
et cetera.

2055
01:26:07,430 --> 01:26:09,860
He left and that was fine.
That was his deal.

2056
01:26:10,220 --> 01:26:11,053
Tj was going to try to have them come 
back in and train at our gym for his 

2057
01:26:14,181 --> 01:26:15,014
fight.
And dwayne refused to do it and I'd had 

2058
01:26:16,461 --> 01:26:17,390
a talk with teaching.
He's like,

2059
01:26:17,870 --> 01:26:19,310
it was crying and like,
you know,

2060
01:26:19,311 --> 01:26:22,010
that,
that dwayne just wanting to focus on his

2061
01:26:22,011 --> 01:26:23,750
own gym and this and that,
and he's like,

2062
01:26:23,751 --> 01:26:24,810
you know,
whatever.

2063
01:26:24,811 --> 01:26:25,644
And so he's like,
I'm going to spend some time there and 

2064
01:26:26,691 --> 01:26:27,770
spend some time here,
et cetera.

2065
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:31,130
Like that's fine.
So tj,

2066
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:32,713
when he got there,
got some exposure for muscle farm and 

2067
01:26:36,261 --> 01:26:37,370
muscle farm

2068
01:26:37,910 --> 01:26:40,180
was they help people out here.
Duane ludwig's,

2069
01:26:40,181 --> 01:26:41,014
a former kickboxing champion who was an 
mma fighter who fought in the ufc and 

2070
01:26:44,271 --> 01:26:47,450
then went on to be a coach for a year 
for a year and three of us.

2071
01:26:47,670 --> 01:26:47,931
No,
no,

2072
01:26:47,931 --> 01:26:49,580
he coaches now a lie,
right?

2073
01:26:49,690 --> 01:26:51,350
With his own gym.
But for you guys,

2074
01:26:51,351 --> 01:26:53,660
he was your striking coach for a little 
bit,

2075
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:54,553
for a year and three months and he 
worked with a bunch of fighters and he 

2076
01:26:56,531 --> 01:26:59,460
had a very special relationship with tj,
right.

2077
01:26:59,540 --> 01:27:00,373
Then he moved out to denver and he moved
out to denver to fight is I want to 

2078
01:27:02,661 --> 01:27:04,370
start his own thing.
And then muscle farm,

2079
01:27:04,371 --> 01:27:09,140
which has a big gym in denver.
They invited tj to come train there.

2080
01:27:09,170 --> 01:27:10,003
So to fill in the blanks when people 
that don't know the story that aren't 

2081
01:27:11,871 --> 01:27:13,040
maybe big time fans.

2082
01:27:13,090 --> 01:27:13,930
So then,
so yeah.

2083
01:27:13,931 --> 01:27:16,580
So then he,
he basically said that he wanted to,

2084
01:27:17,530 --> 01:27:18,840
that he wanted to,
uh,

2085
01:27:19,380 --> 01:27:21,640
he was doing his camps there for about a
year and a half,

2086
01:27:21,850 --> 01:27:24,220
but he'd spent a little time there,
a little time here.

2087
01:27:24,820 --> 01:27:27,630
Most of the time he lived in sacramento 
most time there we go.

2088
01:27:27,850 --> 01:27:29,920
Work with dwayne.
No problem with it.

2089
01:27:29,921 --> 01:27:32,710
I cornered with dwayne even after he 
left with,

2090
01:27:32,711 --> 01:27:35,290
uh,
with you guys and stuff like that wasn't

2091
01:27:35,291 --> 01:27:36,124
an issue.
So then I heard dwayne actually text me 

2092
01:27:39,370 --> 01:27:42,190
and was like,
dwayne said something like,

2093
01:27:43,110 --> 01:27:43,943
well,
I mean there's a whole side of the 

2094
01:27:44,591 --> 01:27:46,240
dwayne thing,
which is hilarious.

2095
01:27:47,170 --> 01:27:51,340
That was him getting weird like a year 
after he left,

2096
01:27:51,460 --> 01:27:52,293
like acting like he was there.
He tried to sue me for a figment of his 

2097
01:27:56,111 --> 01:27:58,750
imagination of some money that wasn't 
even there.

2098
01:27:58,751 --> 01:27:59,584
And like this whole thing he had like 
his one of his students write this 

2099
01:28:01,541 --> 01:28:01,750
thing.

2100
01:28:01,750 --> 01:28:04,930
So there is something where he said that
I'd like,

2101
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:09,160
I can't even remember,
like something like I didn't give them a

2102
01:28:09,161 --> 01:28:12,010
discretionary bonus,
it was supposed to be given or something

2103
01:28:12,011 --> 01:28:12,844
like that and so there was like some,
some like intermingling is about that 

2104
01:28:18,310 --> 01:28:21,610
whatever.
So dwayne texts me and says,

2105
01:28:21,730 --> 01:28:22,391
and I said,
dude,

2106
01:28:22,391 --> 01:28:24,490
I never said I had to set the record 
straight on.

2107
01:28:24,491 --> 01:28:26,320
Dwayne and dwayne texts me and says,
hey,

2108
01:28:26,770 --> 01:28:29,800
I'm not the one trying to steal your 
team in your fighters.

2109
01:28:29,801 --> 01:28:34,750
I know there's a team out here in denver
being built but I'm not a part of that.

2110
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:36,790
And I was like,
are you talking about?

2111
01:28:36,791 --> 01:28:39,620
And then,
and I had talked to him and someone else

2112
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:40,810
said that,
hey,

2113
01:28:40,811 --> 01:28:45,811
I heard that matt brown and tj dillashaw
are getting paid to be on this team.

2114
01:28:47,740 --> 01:28:49,520
And so I come in and I was like,
hey,

2115
01:28:49,521 --> 01:28:50,354
I,
we were talking about some team things 

2116
01:28:50,881 --> 01:28:51,700
and teachers and practice.

2117
01:28:51,700 --> 01:28:52,533
I go,
I go,

2118
01:28:52,620 --> 01:28:53,453
I get the weirdest thing.
Dwayne texts me this and this other guy 

2119
01:28:55,751 --> 01:28:56,321
said this.
I said,

2120
01:28:56,321 --> 01:28:59,940
are you going to like,
are you getting paid to go?

2121
01:28:59,941 --> 01:29:02,430
Would be starting a new or something and
it was,

2122
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:03,593
cody was there and lance was there and 
always there and tj like lies straight 

2123
01:29:06,961 --> 01:29:09,120
to us about,
about the whole thing.

2124
01:29:09,121 --> 01:29:09,960
He's like,
he's like,

2125
01:29:09,961 --> 01:29:11,680
no man.
I know they offered me but I'm not,

2126
01:29:11,681 --> 01:29:13,020
I'm not,
I'm with you guys.

2127
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:16,020
He's like this and that.
And I was like,

2128
01:29:16,110 --> 01:29:16,861
okay,
whatever.

2129
01:29:16,861 --> 01:29:21,861
Then time goes on and we have an actual 
sit down and talk.

2130
01:29:21,931 --> 01:29:24,120
We'd go eat sometimes and everything in 
tj,

2131
01:29:24,450 --> 01:29:26,060
Chad mendez,
uh,

2132
01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:26,903
my buddy phil,
we all go and eat and tj just tells me 

2133
01:29:29,700 --> 01:29:30,570
like,
hey man,

2134
01:29:31,070 --> 01:29:31,903
uh,
my next camp I'm going to go out to 

2135
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:34,493
denver,
which he'd already been going out to 

2136
01:29:35,011 --> 01:29:37,330
denver has been like a year and a half 
since twin.

2137
01:29:37,330 --> 01:29:38,163
It'd be gone.
It wasn't like he like gone and 

2138
01:29:39,061 --> 01:29:40,380
whatever.
And he's like,

2139
01:29:40,890 --> 01:29:41,723
but muscle farm offered me like some,
some real good money to like be part of 

2140
01:29:45,931 --> 01:29:46,621
their team.
He was like,

2141
01:29:46,621 --> 01:29:47,454
so I'm basically,
I'm no longer going to be representing 

2142
01:29:49,291 --> 01:29:52,050
team alpha male.
I like,

2143
01:29:52,051 --> 01:29:55,410
I'm going to do my camp out there and 
I'm gonna you know,

2144
01:29:55,790 --> 01:29:57,720
they're going to announce me and we're 
talking about.

2145
01:29:58,860 --> 01:30:00,870
He told me at the time it was I think 
4,500

2146
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:04,430
bucks a month,
a month and they were going to rent them

2147
01:30:04,431 --> 01:30:07,170
a house and I go and I was like,
okay.

2148
01:30:07,171 --> 01:30:09,480
And Chad was sitting right there and he 
just sit there and go.

2149
01:30:09,750 --> 01:30:10,830
I go,
well shoot man.

2150
01:30:10,831 --> 01:30:12,540
It was nice having you on the team.
And he's like,

2151
01:30:12,780 --> 01:30:13,890
why are you getting upset?
I go,

2152
01:30:13,891 --> 01:30:15,440
I'm not upset.
I'm just saying like,

2153
01:30:15,930 --> 01:30:17,310
like,
you're off the team then.

2154
01:30:17,310 --> 01:30:19,110
And he's like,
well yeah,

2155
01:30:19,111 --> 01:30:19,830
but he's like,
but I,

2156
01:30:19,830 --> 01:30:20,663
I have a house here.
I'm still want to come back and like 

2157
01:30:22,410 --> 01:30:25,830
come in and spar and when I'm in town in
the off season or whatever.

2158
01:30:25,831 --> 01:30:26,664
And I'm like,
for real weird to you guys for real 

2159
01:30:28,321 --> 01:30:29,280
weird.
And then I said,

2160
01:30:29,310 --> 01:30:30,143
I said,
well,

2161
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:32,393
I said so that.
So he was no longer going to be on our 

2162
01:30:33,451 --> 01:30:36,360
team who's gonna be on a different team 
and.

2163
01:30:36,390 --> 01:30:37,223
But then he wanted to come in.
At the time I'm ranked number three in 

2164
01:30:39,151 --> 01:30:39,984
the world,
cody and him are going at it and 

2165
01:30:41,491 --> 01:30:43,350
practice.
It's anybody's given day,

2166
01:30:43,590 --> 01:30:44,423
you know,
we can look at the footage if you guys 

2167
01:30:45,931 --> 01:30:46,990
have the footage,
you know,

2168
01:30:47,310 --> 01:30:50,730
but uh,
and then holds verse seven and no,

2169
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,310
and,
and had just won the ultimate fighter.

2170
01:30:53,610 --> 01:30:55,890
And so tj is basically saying is leading
the team.

2171
01:30:55,890 --> 01:30:56,671
I go,
bro tj,

2172
01:30:56,671 --> 01:30:58,200
I said,
I said you can,

2173
01:30:58,760 --> 01:31:00,630
you know,
you're welcome to the team,

2174
01:31:00,631 --> 01:31:04,800
but like if you're,
if you're no longer on the team,

2175
01:31:04,801 --> 01:31:06,090
like you know,
what,

2176
01:31:06,091 --> 01:31:07,010
what,
what does that mean?

2177
01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:08,010
He's like,
well,

2178
01:31:08,011 --> 01:31:10,210
I mean it's just a good opportunity man.
They like,

2179
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:14,130
they don't have to pay.
They pay me to train and,

2180
01:31:14,370 --> 01:31:16,040
and like you know,
it's,

2181
01:31:16,300 --> 01:31:18,960
they're starting a team and everything's
going to be under one roof and I go,

2182
01:31:18,961 --> 01:31:19,794
all right,
cool.

2183
01:31:20,290 --> 01:31:22,050
That's anybody ever done that where it 
worked?

2184
01:31:22,590 --> 01:31:25,350
I don't know.
They're always tried that but,

2185
01:31:26,140 --> 01:31:28,500
but here's the thing.
So then after that it was like,

2186
01:31:28,501 --> 01:31:30,450
he's like,
who's going to leave in two weeks?

2187
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:35,720
And so me and teach me and cody are 
sitting in there and like we hadn't said

2188
01:31:36,091 --> 01:31:37,200
anything.
I told fabio,

2189
01:31:37,201 --> 01:31:38,820
art instructor,
uh,

2190
01:31:38,850 --> 01:31:39,683
our jujitsu instructor,
what was happening and he told someone 

2191
01:31:41,581 --> 01:31:42,414
in Brazil is the brazilian in Brazil.
He leaked it out that tj was changing 

2192
01:31:45,421 --> 01:31:48,210
camps and there was all this drama and,
and this and that.

2193
01:31:48,211 --> 01:31:49,044
And then,
um,

2194
01:31:49,470 --> 01:31:50,303
I said,
look,

2195
01:31:50,460 --> 01:31:51,293
tj.
So he,

2196
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:53,970
he was coming in and teach you is never 
the best teammate.

2197
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,510
He would like try to hurt people.
He's a very competitive guy and he has a

2198
01:31:57,511 --> 01:31:59,860
temper and like trying her people how

2199
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:03,490
she shot him.
She always,

2200
01:32:03,790 --> 01:32:07,180
we always use it in the bell boxing.
He nia,

2201
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:09,720
he's like,
I just need him to the bottom.

2202
01:32:09,730 --> 01:32:10,031
Like,
yeah,

2203
01:32:10,031 --> 01:32:12,330
we're boxing sparring easy to the body 
of the box.

2204
01:32:13,420 --> 01:32:14,253
Did asked.
There's no secret about tj is we talked 

2205
01:32:17,621 --> 01:32:18,454
about it when he was still on the team 
also that he had to be like reeled in a 

2206
01:32:20,921 --> 01:32:21,461
little bit.
Right.

2207
01:32:21,461 --> 01:32:23,090
He's just,
he's just got a temper.

2208
01:32:23,220 --> 01:32:24,910
Just want to call them killer shaw.
Yeah.

2209
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:27,580
Killa sha dilla shank like all that kind
of stuff.

2210
01:32:27,750 --> 01:32:28,580
I mean,
it was,

2211
01:32:28,580 --> 01:32:29,830
it was,
that was his thing,

2212
01:32:29,831 --> 01:32:31,570
you know,
that's just super competitive.

2213
01:32:31,571 --> 01:32:34,000
Aggressive guy and cheap shots.
Yes.

2214
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:36,400
Super competitiveness.
Like I'm competitive.

2215
01:32:36,401 --> 01:32:37,620
I don't want to lose.
Someone takes me,

2216
01:32:37,630 --> 01:32:38,463
you know,
I'm fighting tooth and nail not to get 

2217
01:32:39,791 --> 01:32:40,624
taken down or get that extra win that 
round it just at the end of the bell 

2218
01:32:44,270 --> 01:32:44,290
knees.

2219
01:32:44,290 --> 01:32:46,360
You know what I mean?
That's why chris is out,

2220
01:32:46,420 --> 01:32:47,890
you know what I mean?
Need him in the back of the head.

2221
01:32:49,380 --> 01:32:51,310
I mean chris holdsworth,
that's where the injuries.

2222
01:32:51,330 --> 01:32:52,163
I mean I don't want to.
Chris doesn't want us to really talk to 

2223
01:32:53,661 --> 01:32:56,420
them about that number that we're 
talking about.

2224
01:32:56,440 --> 01:33:00,360
Cheap shot and that's what I mean.
He doesn't care if we talk about it.

2225
01:33:00,361 --> 01:33:01,240
I mean,
I guess truth.

2226
01:33:01,260 --> 01:33:02,510
That's what happened.
What,

2227
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:03,353
what,
how did it go?

2228
01:33:03,940 --> 01:33:04,773
I'm not saying I remember distinctively 
duane used to come up with chris and be 

2229
01:33:10,541 --> 01:33:10,901
like,
hey,

2230
01:33:10,901 --> 01:33:12,730
like grasshopper.
He's like,

2231
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,760
we have a.
Tj is fight and he'd take it easy,

2232
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:17,930
take it easy on him.
And chris is a killer.

2233
01:33:17,931 --> 01:33:19,690
It's a killer.
Fucking him up everybody.

2234
01:33:19,691 --> 01:33:20,524
I mean,
christmas was the animal and I guess 

2235
01:33:21,791 --> 01:33:22,624
chris choked him out and tj got out and 
talking to him in the back of the head 

2236
01:33:24,970 --> 01:33:29,970
when he's down in the man who was down 
on the mat and the spying,

2237
01:33:30,311 --> 01:33:31,870
but it needs to the back of the head.

2238
01:33:31,990 --> 01:33:33,510
That's what.
Why,

2239
01:33:34,260 --> 01:33:36,520
I mean just dirty shit like I've been a 
couple times.

2240
01:33:36,521 --> 01:33:39,820
I told chris let him up,
was submitted them,

2241
01:33:39,821 --> 01:33:41,950
let them off and then teach them in the 
back of my head.

2242
01:33:41,951 --> 01:33:43,440
I don't know if that's exactly how it 
was.

2243
01:33:43,610 --> 01:33:44,443
I remember seeing the whole thing.
I don't really want to get into this 

2244
01:33:46,061 --> 01:33:47,320
because it's christmas gig,
man.

2245
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:48,473
Yeah,
that's fine.

2246
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:50,100
But we've already gotten into already 
got into it,

2247
01:33:50,740 --> 01:33:51,573
but yeah.
So let's talk about tj being the chief 

2248
01:33:52,950 --> 01:33:53,783
charles.
That's what literally killed chris's 

2249
01:33:55,780 --> 01:33:57,720
career.
No,

2250
01:33:58,150 --> 01:33:59,890
majority of obviously concussions.
Yeah.

2251
01:33:59,900 --> 01:34:03,030
We're real good friends with chris and 
they live together though.

2252
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:05,310
They lived together.
He went through and his.

2253
01:34:05,330 --> 01:34:08,680
That's why his last fight was he had to 
fight with concussion because he,

2254
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:10,530
you know,
he was scheduled to fight happens.

2255
01:34:10,531 --> 01:34:12,840
This is why he's just like that.
And you know,

2256
01:34:12,841 --> 01:34:13,674
we've all,
you know,

2257
01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:15,820
it's one of the things that when I first
came out there,

2258
01:34:15,850 --> 01:34:17,440
I was never really close with tj.

2259
01:34:17,710 --> 01:34:18,543
I was out there,
I was doing well with the guys and a 

2260
01:34:19,391 --> 01:34:20,580
couple of the guys told me like,
man,

2261
01:34:20,620 --> 01:34:23,420
tj can't wait to spar you.
This is when he was coming off as rafi,

2262
01:34:23,421 --> 01:34:25,070
I'll send cell loss.
I was like,

2263
01:34:25,090 --> 01:34:25,923
cool,
like fuck it,

2264
01:34:26,470 --> 01:34:27,303
I can't wait to spar with him either.
He's better and it's going to be a good 

2265
01:34:28,961 --> 01:34:29,794
round,
you know.

2266
01:34:30,100 --> 01:34:31,630
And I was pretty worn like,
hey,

2267
01:34:31,631 --> 01:34:33,010
tj does some cheap shit.
Just,

2268
01:34:33,060 --> 01:34:33,893
you know,
keep it going.

2269
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:35,560
And,
and others video,

2270
01:34:35,561 --> 01:34:37,090
I think I have some,
uh,

2271
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:40,240
one of the kids that was a boxing and he
sent it to me months ago.

2272
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:41,230
Tj,
like,

2273
01:34:41,230 --> 01:34:42,730
keep shutting me out in the bell.
I was like,

2274
01:34:43,240 --> 01:34:43,991
tell tj.
I said,

2275
01:34:43,991 --> 01:34:44,590
look,
motherfucker,

2276
01:34:44,590 --> 01:34:46,480
you cheap shot me again.
We're taking the gloves off.

2277
01:34:46,481 --> 01:34:47,950
We're going in the street and fighting.
Yeah,

2278
01:34:47,960 --> 01:34:50,410
I down because of that.
Yeah.

2279
01:34:50,710 --> 01:34:52,340
I just don't ever like that.
Especially the teammates.

2280
01:34:52,341 --> 01:34:53,500
You don't do that shit.
Like,

2281
01:34:53,770 --> 01:34:54,501
hey you,
you,

2282
01:34:54,501 --> 01:34:55,450
you get me,
you get me,

2283
01:34:55,451 --> 01:34:57,040
but don't cheap shot me at the end of 
the bell.

2284
01:34:57,050 --> 01:34:57,980
And then as soon as

2285
01:34:57,980 --> 01:34:59,150
you're hitting someone after the chief,
you're like,

2286
01:34:59,151 --> 01:34:59,961
oh dude,
I'm sorry,

2287
01:34:59,961 --> 01:35:01,400
like,
you know what you're doing.

2288
01:35:01,401 --> 01:35:02,750
So anyway.
So anyways,

2289
01:35:03,140 --> 01:35:03,973
that being said,
we knew that was part of tjx thing but 

2290
01:35:06,471 --> 01:35:07,304
now he's not longer part of our team and
he's also getting paid to go somewhere 

2291
01:35:12,291 --> 01:35:13,124
else.
He's no longer contributing in any way 

2292
01:35:14,300 --> 01:35:17,240
and he wants to come in and come in and 
spar our guys and like,

2293
01:35:17,570 --> 01:35:18,403
like get.
He basically wanted to be on our team 

2294
01:35:20,090 --> 01:35:20,923
benefit of our team without being a part
of the team anymore and getting paid to 

2295
01:35:23,661 --> 01:35:26,320
be somewhere else,
which I would have been finding it.

2296
01:35:26,450 --> 01:35:27,500
Talk to me about like,
hey,

2297
01:35:27,501 --> 01:35:29,720
I'm going to work something out where I 
go get paid and do this,

2298
01:35:29,721 --> 01:35:31,730
whatever.
But then I'm like okay.

2299
01:35:32,030 --> 01:35:32,863
So that whole week he's in there and 
he's sitting there watching me and cody 

2300
01:35:37,790 --> 01:35:39,560
in practice and I don't care.

2301
01:35:39,650 --> 01:35:40,483
I mean tj is a competitive.
He's always looking for edge that whole 

2302
01:35:43,910 --> 01:35:45,500
week prior to telling us that he was 
leaving,

2303
01:35:45,501 --> 01:35:47,000
he kept getting like,
hey,

2304
01:35:47,001 --> 01:35:50,240
there's a getting some proprietary 
series in this series.

2305
01:35:50,241 --> 01:35:52,330
There's a single a guard says I used to 
get them with and he's like,

2306
01:35:52,490 --> 01:35:54,890
have me and martin kampmann show him all
this stuff.

2307
01:35:54,891 --> 01:35:55,840
We were working on,
hey,

2308
01:35:55,850 --> 01:35:58,550
can you show me this?
Show me that like the week before.

2309
01:35:58,940 --> 01:36:00,700
And then so he goes,
I go,

2310
01:36:00,750 --> 01:36:01,521
tj,
look man,

2311
01:36:01,521 --> 01:36:03,170
this is getting awkward and practice.
I said,

2312
01:36:03,171 --> 01:36:03,890
look,
we can.

2313
01:36:03,890 --> 01:36:05,390
I had them over at my house and I said,
look,

2314
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:08,570
we can build a friendship however we 
want to do it.

2315
01:36:08,990 --> 01:36:11,180
I said,
but this is getting awkward and like you

2316
01:36:11,330 --> 01:36:14,990
being in practice and he no longer being
on the team and everything else.

2317
01:36:15,410 --> 01:36:16,243
Like you know,
let's finish out this this last couple 

2318
01:36:17,991 --> 01:36:20,180
of days and then,
you know,

2319
01:36:20,660 --> 01:36:21,650
you'd be on your team.

2320
01:36:21,710 --> 01:36:23,600
We can be friends on,
on the outside,

2321
01:36:23,601 --> 01:36:25,220
we can work on that as a,
as a deal,

2322
01:36:25,221 --> 01:36:27,110
whatever.
And he's like you.

2323
01:36:27,350 --> 01:36:29,300
He wanted to come in and train with our 
team's still,

2324
01:36:29,301 --> 01:36:31,850
you know,
as not as not part of the team.

2325
01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:35,000
Right.
And then I was like,

2326
01:36:35,001 --> 01:36:37,970
but you're welcome to stay on our team 
obviously if you want and continue to do

2327
01:36:37,971 --> 01:36:41,420
your camps and whatnot.
And he is just like,

2328
01:36:42,470 --> 01:36:43,303
like out.
So at that point it became him taking 

2329
01:36:46,881 --> 01:36:48,130
this opportunity,
going to denver,

2330
01:36:48,140 --> 01:36:48,973
being with dwayne,
getting paid to do the muscle farm 

2331
01:36:50,331 --> 01:36:51,164
thing.
And then the whole thing with connor 

2332
01:36:53,271 --> 01:36:57,590
happened on the tv show before this,
before any of this happened,

2333
01:36:57,830 --> 01:37:00,570
conor mcgregor started calling him in a 
coma.

2334
01:37:00,590 --> 01:37:04,730
Snake a snake because me and connor had 
one conversation.

2335
01:37:04,731 --> 01:37:07,010
We were sitting there and he goes,
he goes,

2336
01:37:07,070 --> 01:37:10,490
man,
congratulations on tj defending his belt

2337
01:37:10,491 --> 01:37:12,470
because he was still on her team is last
title defense.

2338
01:37:13,010 --> 01:37:13,611
And I go,
thanks.

2339
01:37:13,611 --> 01:37:15,440
He goes,
but what's up with dwayne saying that no

2340
01:37:15,441 --> 01:37:17,480
one on your team wants to be champions.
That's weird.

2341
01:37:17,481 --> 01:37:17,901
I said,
oh,

2342
01:37:17,901 --> 01:37:21,230
he's just bitter because you know,
he's trying to get everyone to go out to

2343
01:37:21,231 --> 01:37:24,170
his camp and he's just being a hater and
this and that.

2344
01:37:24,710 --> 01:37:27,000
And he goes,
he took that little bit of,

2345
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:29,780
of,
of drama between me and dwayne,

2346
01:37:29,781 --> 01:37:32,090
like dwayne saying that no one on our 
team wanted to be your champions,

2347
01:37:32,091 --> 01:37:34,610
including cody,
who sent him a text,

2348
01:37:34,670 --> 01:37:36,080
a tweet that said,
hey,

2349
01:37:36,260 --> 01:37:37,093
keep my name out of your mouth and 
you're like a jealous girlfriend or 

2350
01:37:38,541 --> 01:37:39,374
whatever.
And he said he took that one little 

2351
01:37:40,821 --> 01:37:43,190
thing and then next time you saw tj he 
goes,

2352
01:37:43,191 --> 01:37:44,960
oh,
there's a snake in the grass.

2353
01:37:44,961 --> 01:37:45,794
And just built it in this big thing.
So that means either how well he is so 

2354
01:37:49,521 --> 01:37:51,120
good at seeing people.
Right.

2355
01:37:51,470 --> 01:37:56,190
So that took like what really happened,
which is tj got to go somewhere else.

2356
01:37:56,550 --> 01:37:57,240
Me saying,
all right,

2357
01:37:57,240 --> 01:37:58,090
fine,
if you're going to do that,

2358
01:37:58,091 --> 01:37:59,190
it's cool.
But like,

2359
01:37:59,191 --> 01:38:00,330
you know,
if you're on that team,

2360
01:38:00,331 --> 01:38:01,164
you're on that team.
And then then connor turned the public 

2361
01:38:04,681 --> 01:38:09,420
around on him because it came out later 
after the thing.

2362
01:38:09,630 --> 01:38:12,300
And so then tiji became the victim and 
then he.

2363
01:38:12,350 --> 01:38:14,950
And now tj is new stories that I,
I,

2364
01:38:15,060 --> 01:38:18,000
I got mad that he was trained with duane
ludwig and I kicked him off the team.

2365
01:38:18,260 --> 01:38:18,651
Well,
you know,

2366
01:38:18,651 --> 01:38:19,484
tj now has a snake as his logo.
I know on the ultimate fighter he 

2367
01:38:23,661 --> 01:38:25,070
brought in snakes,
you know what I mean?

2368
01:38:25,071 --> 01:38:26,690
He just,
he's at home with it,

2369
01:38:26,691 --> 01:38:28,130
you know,
he's cool with it.

2370
01:38:28,131 --> 01:38:28,964
So it's all good.
I don't weird rewinding back a little 

2371
01:38:30,861 --> 01:38:32,720
bit like if you want to be friends,
let's be friends,

2372
01:38:32,721 --> 01:38:34,130
but don't,
don't,

2373
01:38:34,131 --> 01:38:38,120
don't lie back to it.
I remember going to Canada,

2374
01:38:38,150 --> 01:38:41,520
the whole was during the ultimate 
fighter sticking up for,

2375
01:38:41,580 --> 01:38:44,720
for tj because tj was st [inaudible] 
basically,

2376
01:38:44,721 --> 01:38:46,700
you know,
like inviting them to fight and,

2377
01:38:46,940 --> 01:38:47,490
and teachers.
Uh,

2378
01:38:47,490 --> 01:38:48,141
yeah,
you know,

2379
01:38:48,141 --> 01:38:50,180
like nonchalantly,
whatever about it.

2380
01:38:50,181 --> 01:38:51,670
But it wasn't defending himself.
Like I'm not a,

2381
01:38:51,770 --> 01:38:52,603
it's someone calling me a steak in the 
grass and say I was like this loyal to 

2382
01:38:54,921 --> 01:38:57,770
my teammates and shit.
We're fighting and that's why I stick up

2383
01:38:57,771 --> 01:39:00,530
for tj is tj is literally,
I'm like we're partying in vegas,

2384
01:39:00,531 --> 01:39:01,310
we're having a good time.

2385
01:39:01,310 --> 01:39:04,090
Like for the first time kind of a heart 
to heart with them.

2386
01:39:04,120 --> 01:39:04,811
With tj.
Yeah.

2387
01:39:04,811 --> 01:39:06,860
And he's like,
so he's telling me this shit.

2388
01:39:06,861 --> 01:39:07,341
Like he said,
dude,

2389
01:39:07,341 --> 01:39:09,080
I'm with you guys.
Like I'm not leaving.

2390
01:39:09,081 --> 01:39:10,400
Fuck that.
Like I'm with you guys.

2391
01:39:10,580 --> 01:39:12,670
So I'm like,
this is not even that.

2392
01:39:12,671 --> 01:39:13,504
I'm not that close with tj,
but he just powered through the 

2393
01:39:15,321 --> 01:39:16,154
champion.
He's,

2394
01:39:16,310 --> 01:39:18,410
you know,
even the champion,

2395
01:39:18,411 --> 01:39:19,800
you get taken care of and people you 
know,

2396
01:39:19,950 --> 01:39:22,700
to defend them.
So connor was doing that.

2397
01:39:22,701 --> 01:39:24,000
He's like,
what do you guys want to do it?

2398
01:39:24,050 --> 01:39:25,730
It was talking about t j.
So I was like,

2399
01:39:25,731 --> 01:39:27,320
man,
I'll do something bad like you're asking

2400
01:39:27,321 --> 01:39:28,154
for a fight.
We'll fight and broken to the pushing 

2401
01:39:29,871 --> 01:39:33,980
match and it was going out to the 
outside because that's tj saying that we

2402
01:39:33,981 --> 01:39:35,600
were,
there he is with us.

2403
01:39:35,601 --> 01:39:36,001
I'm like,
dude,

2404
01:39:36,001 --> 01:39:36,834
you're not going to talk about my team 
and how does it feel now knowing that 

2405
01:39:39,561 --> 01:39:43,130
you're going to defend against tj with 
all this weird drama,

2406
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:44,900
all this bullshit for me.

2407
01:39:44,900 --> 01:39:48,560
I don't ever get wrapped up into it.
It might look like that with this show,

2408
01:39:48,650 --> 01:39:53,650
and this is my life's been like this so 
I can live and prosper and folks on when

2409
01:39:53,850 --> 01:39:56,150
it's time to focus and die,
it's like flipping a switch.

2410
01:39:56,480 --> 01:39:59,510
Like I can be doing the dumbest shit 
like you're fighting.

2411
01:39:59,540 --> 01:40:01,370
Dominick cruz were in the back just 
doing dumb shit.

2412
01:40:01,430 --> 01:40:02,840
Like I might warm it up.
I'm just.

2413
01:40:03,410 --> 01:40:04,243
I'm just flipping.
The switch was like that since a little 

2414
01:40:05,781 --> 01:40:08,570
kid like wrestling football.
Just when the lights shine,

2415
01:40:09,610 --> 01:40:11,180
I shine the brightest.
I always feel like,

2416
01:40:11,450 --> 01:40:12,283
and now a tj,
I don't respect him as a person and it 

2417
01:40:15,411 --> 01:40:16,850
doesn't mean I don't respect him as a 
fighter.

2418
01:40:17,030 --> 01:40:17,863
The guy skillful,
he's mean as fuck and he's going to 

2419
01:40:19,910 --> 01:40:21,740
bring a fight.
That's going to be what I.

2420
01:40:22,370 --> 01:40:24,140
I love the challenge with tj.

2421
01:40:24,140 --> 01:40:26,630
It's gonna be a challenge.
I know him like the back of my hand,

2422
01:40:26,631 --> 01:40:28,040
my coaches know him,
like the back of my hand.

2423
01:40:28,310 --> 01:40:30,890
We were able to dissect dominick cruz 
for me,

2424
01:40:31,190 --> 01:40:32,750
you know,
through all of their experiences.

2425
01:40:32,751 --> 01:40:33,584
This is a guy,
they build it up that was there longer 

2426
01:40:35,391 --> 01:40:36,500
than I've been.
You know,

2427
01:40:36,610 --> 01:40:38,980
I went out there at to know I had 10 
fights now with,

2428
01:40:39,030 --> 01:40:40,910
with the team alpha male,
now 11,

2429
01:40:40,970 --> 01:40:41,651
now 11.
Oh,

2430
01:40:41,651 --> 01:40:43,120
world champion through the,
you know,

2431
01:40:43,130 --> 01:40:44,750
obviously I was scared before I got 
there.

2432
01:40:45,020 --> 01:40:47,360
We blended together that the recipe for 
success,

2433
01:40:47,361 --> 01:40:48,194
I listened to follow lead with favor and
a lot of other guys on the team and so 

2434
01:40:52,071 --> 01:40:55,470
we know t jan always going to do.
I know what I have to be prepared for,

2435
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:56,913
so I'm excited for it.
Like all those drama bullshit a 

2436
01:40:59,111 --> 01:41:00,240
whatever,
like it's been,

2437
01:41:00,241 --> 01:41:01,074
it's gone on too long,
like I'm just ready to focus on this 

2438
01:41:03,341 --> 01:41:06,310
fight and go in there and do what I have
to do to get this winning against.

2439
01:41:06,350 --> 01:41:08,590
You have a good mindset.
I mean think that is.

2440
01:41:08,780 --> 01:41:12,130
It's a gigantic part of what makes 
someone successful in the sport.

2441
01:41:12,131 --> 01:41:14,350
It's being able to do that.
Like you said,

2442
01:41:14,590 --> 01:41:15,423
having the confidence that you're going 
to shine the brightest when the lights 

2443
01:41:17,111 --> 01:41:17,944
are on and having this mindset like 
you're appreciating the fact that tj is 

2444
01:41:20,951 --> 01:41:23,860
mean and skillful hawkins is going to 
give you a great challenge.

2445
01:41:24,040 --> 01:41:26,850
Yeah.
It's like a couch or something like you.

2446
01:41:27,050 --> 01:41:29,260
What do you think tj is doing?
He's sitting on the couch,

2447
01:41:29,261 --> 01:41:30,970
so you're getting up,
going to do the extra work and you know,

2448
01:41:30,971 --> 01:41:34,330
tj is a workhorse.
Like that for me makes me motivated.

2449
01:41:34,331 --> 01:41:36,880
I need these guys to keep me motivated.
Like dominic,

2450
01:41:36,881 --> 01:41:37,301
you know,
he was,

2451
01:41:37,301 --> 01:41:39,610
I watched the embeddeds of him.
He was running alone,

2452
01:41:39,611 --> 01:41:40,960
you know,
like a sob story on christmas.

2453
01:41:40,961 --> 01:41:41,770
Like I just got to do this.

2454
01:41:41,770 --> 01:41:43,000
I like it.
I'm sitting there,

2455
01:41:43,001 --> 01:41:44,200
you know,
we're having a party.

2456
01:41:45,300 --> 01:41:47,800
Enjoy this shit.
Like I'm about to fight my first title.

2457
01:41:47,970 --> 01:41:48,803
You know,
I've never had this time again in my 

2458
01:41:49,871 --> 01:41:50,704
life.
I'll never fight for my first world 

2459
01:41:51,551 --> 01:41:53,440
title.
Now it's a fight.

2460
01:41:53,441 --> 01:41:55,930
I'm finally getting to defend my title.
Who cares?

2461
01:41:55,931 --> 01:41:56,830
A lot of.
We were talking about this,

2462
01:41:56,831 --> 01:41:57,664
a lot of people when the title,
but what the fuck do they do with it 

2463
01:41:59,090 --> 01:42:01,000
right now it's about creating that 
legacy.

2464
01:42:01,001 --> 01:42:04,300
And now I have tj who's man,
he's a bad motherfucker.

2465
01:42:04,450 --> 01:42:07,720
He was ranked in the pound for pound 
before and the top 10.

2466
01:42:08,710 --> 01:42:09,760
He's a killer.
So that's a.

2467
01:42:10,140 --> 01:42:10,973
I'm going to catapult my career with him
and I know that I'm going to do to do 

2468
01:42:12,851 --> 01:42:13,870
with him,
you know,

2469
01:42:13,871 --> 01:42:14,704
I like said I've been with wanting to 
know when I was green as I was just 

2470
01:42:16,870 --> 01:42:17,860
boxing,
wrestling,

2471
01:42:18,040 --> 01:42:19,630
athletic,
loved to fight.

2472
01:42:19,810 --> 01:42:24,810
Now I blended and found my own style and
just finally I'm getting really um,

2473
01:42:24,930 --> 01:42:28,350
composed in there where I can let my 
shirt and my skill show off it and it's,

2474
01:42:28,360 --> 01:42:30,790
I'm fighting hire people.
So like my skill level rides.

2475
01:42:30,791 --> 01:42:34,600
I've always just liked that.
Now what is this video supposedly of you

2476
01:42:34,601 --> 01:42:35,830
knocking him out?
Oh yeah,

2477
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:38,410
yup.
Oh yeah,

2478
01:42:38,411 --> 01:42:39,241
true.
True.

2479
01:42:39,241 --> 01:42:40,540
Yeah.
How come you guys didn't release it?

2480
01:42:42,050 --> 01:42:43,420
I don't.
First off,

2481
01:42:43,421 --> 01:42:45,010
I don't stop my video.
I have seen it.

2482
01:42:45,150 --> 01:42:48,160
It's just,
it was on justin's gopro and do this.

2483
01:42:48,161 --> 01:42:52,300
I literally that I felt bad not bad for 
it because it was just whatever.

2484
01:42:52,301 --> 01:42:56,360
Tj came followed me around the gym,
wherever I'd go put my gym bag way.

2485
01:42:56,430 --> 01:42:57,161
Like,
hey man,

2486
01:42:57,161 --> 01:42:58,690
like I slipped dude.
I'm like,

2487
01:42:58,720 --> 01:43:00,700
okay.
Like literally,

2488
01:43:00,701 --> 01:43:02,170
like he was off his rocker about it.
I'm like,

2489
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:03,740
super competitive.

2490
01:43:05,180 --> 01:43:06,430
How did it go down?
What happened?

2491
01:43:07,370 --> 01:43:08,770
I've ever had them throw in,
uh,

2492
01:43:09,160 --> 01:43:09,993
you know,
doing his little footwork and then he 

2493
01:43:11,711 --> 01:43:14,650
did the jump down and does the uppercut 
and I just throw overhand,

2494
01:43:14,651 --> 01:43:15,420
right?
Boom.

2495
01:43:15,420 --> 01:43:16,253
Now that I'm out and he got up and it 
was literally fighting easton right 

2496
01:43:21,131 --> 01:43:22,720
before the eastern flanks.
I remember the date,

2497
01:43:23,470 --> 01:43:25,420
he didn't go out cold,
like flat out.

2498
01:43:25,421 --> 01:43:27,930
He just got dropped off and came back.
He came back,

2499
01:43:27,931 --> 01:43:30,910
he was on s stanky leg,
like walker and he's gonna come on.

2500
01:43:30,940 --> 01:43:32,470
That fucker hit me.
I'm like,

2501
01:43:32,471 --> 01:43:33,190
just like,
I'm like,

2502
01:43:33,190 --> 01:43:34,830
like paul,
my gi about like,

2503
01:43:35,070 --> 01:43:36,610
he was saying that after you dropped 
him.

2504
01:43:36,730 --> 01:43:37,380
Yeah.
He's,

2505
01:43:37,380 --> 01:43:38,800
he's a fucking nut.
I love it.

2506
01:43:38,801 --> 01:43:43,801
So I mean he's got a fucking now wasn't 
a knock out as much as it was.

2507
01:43:44,291 --> 01:43:46,080
You just dropped him.
Yeah,

2508
01:43:46,660 --> 01:43:49,480
I dropped them to his.
I mean,

2509
01:43:49,481 --> 01:43:50,020
he,
he,

2510
01:43:50,020 --> 01:43:53,330
his legs it,
I got back up and started saying,

2511
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:54,170
come on motherfucker.

2512
01:43:54,170 --> 01:43:55,160
So he was conscious.
Right.

2513
01:43:55,161 --> 01:43:55,994
And he knew that he was staggering bro.
He looked like John Dotson had him on 

2514
01:43:58,980 --> 01:43:59,990
skates again.
Is that honestly,

2515
01:44:00,050 --> 01:44:00,700
that's what I was like,
oh,

2516
01:44:00,700 --> 01:44:02,120
okay.
And he was like,

2517
01:44:02,130 --> 01:44:04,020
I'm not going to hit him.
You're fighting in two weeks out.

2518
01:44:04,021 --> 01:44:04,854
It wasn't like that,
but literally he had to say he fell 

2519
01:44:06,291 --> 01:44:07,400
forward and he slipped.
I'm like,

2520
01:44:07,401 --> 01:44:09,400
do it doesn't matter.
Like I'm not going to stay anyone know?

2521
01:44:09,650 --> 01:44:10,483
And then I was showing danny how I like 
steal because he likes overran rates 

2522
01:44:13,220 --> 01:44:14,053
high like throw my head off the lane and
bring the right hand this and that book 

2523
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:17,450
was,
comes over and say,

2524
01:44:17,450 --> 01:44:18,283
dude,
he goes.

2525
01:44:18,450 --> 01:44:21,740
And it was on,
it was christmas day or something,

2526
01:44:21,741 --> 01:44:25,010
sparring film.
His own film was all inspiring.

2527
01:44:25,070 --> 01:44:28,280
He's watched you knocked tj and I was 
like,

2528
01:44:28,281 --> 01:44:29,180
oh yeah.
I was like,

2529
01:44:29,480 --> 01:44:30,080
oh wait.

2530
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:30,480
He's like,
oh,

2531
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:31,490
I have it on my gopro.
I'm like,

2532
01:44:31,491 --> 01:44:32,300
oh,
that's cool.

2533
01:44:32,300 --> 01:44:33,133
And then nothing ever came about it.
And then tj was saying that he used to 

2534
01:44:35,031 --> 01:44:37,250
make me cry and practice.
No,

2535
01:44:37,460 --> 01:44:38,970
I have cried and practice for 
[inaudible].

2536
01:44:38,980 --> 01:44:42,140
This motherfucker jumped me on my head 
before the almay to fight.

2537
01:44:42,330 --> 01:44:44,530
I was like super mad about it.
Favorite comes in,

2538
01:44:44,540 --> 01:44:45,373
has the camera crew,
the pierce labs and like we're going 

2539
01:44:47,991 --> 01:44:49,610
hard and like don't show my head.
I'm like,

2540
01:44:49,690 --> 01:44:50,441
oh,
I get mad.

2541
01:44:50,441 --> 01:44:51,050
I'm like,
well,

2542
01:44:51,050 --> 01:44:51,883
you know,
I'm like trying not to get hurt before 

2543
01:44:52,821 --> 01:44:54,410
the fight.
So like I've never cried.

2544
01:44:54,470 --> 01:44:55,820
Teetering there made me cry.
So I was like,

2545
01:44:56,090 --> 01:44:57,590
please be talking about making me cry.
Like,

2546
01:44:57,591 --> 01:44:58,424
oh man,
if I cried when you get dumped on your 

2547
01:44:59,661 --> 01:45:01,490
head,
did you get concussed or something?

2548
01:45:01,491 --> 01:45:05,120
Or you get hurt more like sound like a 
fair.

2549
01:45:05,160 --> 01:45:05,993
He's out.
He cried out saying favorite comes in 

2550
01:45:09,211 --> 01:45:12,350
and just go ma,
I barely remember this.

2551
01:45:12,351 --> 01:45:14,090
I think it was happening.
First off,

2552
01:45:14,450 --> 01:45:17,120
here's the thing,
cody is a dangerous,

2553
01:45:17,150 --> 01:45:19,580
dangerous motherfucker if you're not on 
your,

2554
01:45:19,640 --> 01:45:20,473
even if he's not trying to,
you get in fucking rocked or hurt or 

2555
01:45:23,451 --> 01:45:25,700
whatever.
So I have to be on,

2556
01:45:25,780 --> 01:45:28,010
on a game with him.
Even if you go on light,

2557
01:45:28,011 --> 01:45:29,360
you know,
unless he's going to go light,

2558
01:45:29,570 --> 01:45:32,420
but light doesn't work when the guys 
accurate and strong and everything else.

2559
01:45:32,421 --> 01:45:34,520
So we had to go.
So it was just like a,

2560
01:45:34,640 --> 01:45:35,473
like a wizard hip heist.
Lots me do that last year on my head 

2561
01:45:39,280 --> 01:45:41,490
because you were coming after me.
He was like,

2562
01:45:42,230 --> 01:45:44,900
so I know now when there's a camera crew
fall in favor.

2563
01:45:44,901 --> 01:45:46,700
It's not light.
It's fucking to fight.

2564
01:45:46,990 --> 01:45:47,823
So I love that.
That's where that came from about the 

2565
01:45:51,531 --> 01:45:53,530
video and like coming out like we have 
the video,

2566
01:45:53,560 --> 01:45:54,770
you can get knocked out,
tj.

2567
01:45:55,040 --> 01:45:55,873
You didn't make it.
He was saying he made us beat us all up 

2568
01:45:57,111 --> 01:45:57,944
like with the dominic sit down.
Dwayne was maybe saying that or 

2569
01:46:00,921 --> 01:46:01,780
something.
He said,

2570
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:03,620
oh god,
you beat your teammates.

2571
01:46:03,621 --> 01:46:04,101
And he's like,
yeah,

2572
01:46:04,101 --> 01:46:05,840
I actually for a matter of fact haven't 
beaten them up.

2573
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:08,450
I'm like,
I don't fall most of this stuff.

2574
01:46:08,570 --> 01:46:10,430
What are your.
What's your thoughts on sparring?

2575
01:46:10,460 --> 01:46:13,130
Like do you think that you should be 
sparring hard or do you think you should

2576
01:46:13,160 --> 01:46:13,993
be sparring technical and pull back on 
shots or do you think you should have a 

2577
01:46:17,151 --> 01:46:19,070
little bit of both?
I think a little bit of both.

2578
01:46:19,071 --> 01:46:21,880
I think beginning of camp you get your,
your,

2579
01:46:22,070 --> 01:46:22,903
your,
your rounds into where you're feeling 

2580
01:46:25,211 --> 01:46:27,980
comfortable and then later on I can't be
your technique,

2581
01:46:28,310 --> 01:46:29,041
you know,
your,

2582
01:46:29,041 --> 01:46:31,280
your combos that you're working kind of 
like flight simulation,

2583
01:46:31,281 --> 01:46:32,114
but get those rounds in because you're 
not wanting to beat your body up closer 

2584
01:46:33,831 --> 01:46:36,030
to the fight.
I want to feel fresh at the fight and I,

2585
01:46:36,031 --> 01:46:39,410
that's how I've always used.
I literally get 50 rounds of sparring,

2586
01:46:39,680 --> 01:46:40,513
start tapering off towards the end of 
the end of the fight camp as it called 

2587
01:46:43,680 --> 01:46:45,590
unboxing.
Really camp.

2588
01:46:46,220 --> 01:46:48,320
Do try to spar with only people that you
know,

2589
01:46:48,321 --> 01:46:49,770
so you didn't know that you can trust 
them.

2590
01:46:49,771 --> 01:46:50,010
So you

2591
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:50,843
know,
like especially obviously there's tj 

2592
01:46:52,061 --> 01:46:53,220
fights,
a giant fight,

2593
01:46:53,250 --> 01:46:54,083
huge fight and it's going to be huge.
Not just for the division but for the 

2594
01:46:56,581 --> 01:46:57,414
sport.
I mean all the major fans are going to 

2595
01:46:58,891 --> 01:47:00,030
be paying attention to this fight.
Yeah,

2596
01:47:00,280 --> 01:47:02,410
definitely.
I'm safe with it now.

2597
01:47:02,411 --> 01:47:05,920
Like we were talking about,
I have all these fights log in.

2598
01:47:05,950 --> 01:47:09,100
Not even just all the street fights,
all the boxing matches,

2599
01:47:09,250 --> 01:47:13,000
the sparring work.
I don't need to spar as much,

2600
01:47:13,090 --> 01:47:16,750
but I need to.
We were respiring 10 rounds for the cruz

2601
01:47:16,751 --> 01:47:18,130
fight,
10 straight fives,

2602
01:47:18,330 --> 01:47:19,660
you know,
eight to 10 each week.

2603
01:47:19,670 --> 01:47:22,190
I'm like,
buckles is kinda,

2604
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:23,890
you know,
it worked,

2605
01:47:23,980 --> 01:47:25,870
you know what I mean?
But we were doing smaller glove,

2606
01:47:25,930 --> 01:47:28,370
more mma based,
you know,

2607
01:47:28,540 --> 01:47:29,373
big gloves.
I mean me techniques thrown out the 

2608
01:47:30,221 --> 01:47:30,910
window,
you know,

2609
01:47:30,910 --> 01:47:32,620
people just sprawl and brawl kind of 
shit.

2610
01:47:32,621 --> 01:47:34,150
Like I liked small glove,
you know,

2611
01:47:34,151 --> 01:47:35,830
you're still pepper in the shots hitting
them,

2612
01:47:36,100 --> 01:47:38,050
but you're working the whole gang 
takedowns submissions.

2613
01:47:38,070 --> 01:47:39,380
Right.
So I liked that.

2614
01:47:39,381 --> 01:47:40,214
And also fight simulations.
I like fight like having my uncle come 

2615
01:47:42,941 --> 01:47:43,840
out,
pad holder,

2616
01:47:43,841 --> 01:47:46,620
justin's the other pat order for you 
know.

2617
01:47:46,980 --> 01:47:47,813
And then danny j favor have Like four 
different buyers rely on you as like a 

2618
01:47:50,410 --> 01:47:51,940
fight there on next.
You know,

2619
01:47:51,941 --> 01:47:53,830
you're hitting pads and you get tackled 
from behind.

2620
01:47:53,831 --> 01:47:54,650
You have to work up,
you know,

2621
01:47:54,650 --> 01:47:55,960
things like that.
It's safe,

2622
01:47:55,970 --> 01:47:58,540
you're not.
And that's typically what I like to do.

2623
01:47:58,730 --> 01:47:59,450
Yeah,
there is,

2624
01:47:59,450 --> 01:48:01,070
there is nothing like,
you know,

2625
01:48:01,071 --> 01:48:02,420
like,
like we talked about running,

2626
01:48:02,421 --> 01:48:03,770
sprinting,
blowing out the lungs,

2627
01:48:03,771 --> 01:48:06,980
etc.
There's nothing like actual,

2628
01:48:07,010 --> 01:48:11,280
like intense sparring to simulate what 
it feels like in a fight though and it's

2629
01:48:11,590 --> 01:48:15,800
familiar as you get with it.
It still feels horrible when it happens.

2630
01:48:16,340 --> 01:48:17,173
Like I've been,
I've always been known as the 

2631
01:48:18,530 --> 01:48:19,363
conditioning guy,
like I can condition and and like never 

2632
01:48:22,341 --> 01:48:23,420
get tired,
etc.

2633
01:48:23,470 --> 01:48:24,530
Etc.
In fights,

2634
01:48:24,980 --> 01:48:27,110
you get tired.
It's about the poker face,

2635
01:48:27,111 --> 01:48:27,944
it's about being familiar with it.
It's about like you know these things 

2636
01:48:31,680 --> 01:48:32,270
be.
Yeah,

2637
01:48:32,270 --> 01:48:33,860
being comfortable with that,
being comfortable with it.

2638
01:48:33,861 --> 01:48:37,720
So you have to get there sometimes and 
it's just being smart about it.

2639
01:48:37,980 --> 01:48:40,310
yeah.
Cowboy doesn't spar anymore really?

2640
01:48:40,420 --> 01:48:41,253
Yeah.
Cowboys essentially does mostly drills 

2641
01:48:43,021 --> 01:48:46,570
and pad work and simulations and stuff 
like that and if he does sparkling,

2642
01:48:46,580 --> 01:48:49,980
these bars super light because he was 
realizing that he was beating himself up

2643
01:48:49,981 --> 01:48:50,814
too much and training and coming into 
fights like already kind of a little 

2644
01:48:53,731 --> 01:48:55,290
soft soft but

2645
01:48:55,740 --> 01:48:57,920
hurt them for a week and that's what he 
loved to do.

2646
01:48:58,880 --> 01:49:02,150
Fucking treadmill,
bike workouts and sparring pad work.

2647
01:49:02,630 --> 01:49:04,310
Nothing really else interested with 
jesse.

2648
01:49:04,311 --> 01:49:05,900
Just love sparring,
doing all that.

2649
01:49:05,901 --> 01:49:06,960
So yeah,
he,

2650
01:49:07,080 --> 01:49:08,600
he,
he's sparred hard though.

2651
01:49:09,470 --> 01:49:10,460
I mean he was jackson.

2652
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:11,393
I heard he's a,
he's like a killer knocking dudes 

2653
01:49:14,091 --> 01:49:16,100
allegation like a,
like a,

2654
01:49:16,490 --> 01:49:17,450
like a nasty

2655
01:49:17,940 --> 01:49:20,690
luck in sparring.
Sparring partner probably.

2656
01:49:20,770 --> 01:49:22,840
Maybe that's one of the reasons why I 
stopped doing it.

2657
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:25,660
Probably maybe all that stuff just.
I mean,

2658
01:49:25,661 --> 01:49:28,390
look,
you can't always be the hammer if you're

2659
01:49:28,391 --> 01:49:31,120
having those kind of a rock 'em sock,
'em robots barring sessions,

2660
01:49:31,121 --> 01:49:32,950
you're going to get tagged for sure.
Right?

2661
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:34,210
Absolutely.
For me,

2662
01:49:34,211 --> 01:49:37,600
I like getting in those.
We just had saturday sparring with a lot

2663
01:49:37,610 --> 01:49:38,443
of it.

2664
01:49:38,610 --> 01:49:39,443
Yeah.
We had a killer's row of sparring going 

2665
01:49:41,671 --> 01:49:43,360
on this last weekend,
10 round.

2666
01:49:43,361 --> 01:49:44,900
You've got to get those in.
Sometimes

2667
01:49:44,940 --> 01:49:46,160
it's,
he knows for me,

2668
01:49:46,161 --> 01:49:48,280
like I'd been out of it for a little 
bit,

2669
01:49:48,281 --> 01:49:52,240
like just knowing that it's a couple 
weeks,

2670
01:49:52,420 --> 01:49:53,820
knock the rest off,
you know,

2671
01:49:53,821 --> 01:49:55,690
that's why it feels good,
but you feel good about it.

2672
01:49:55,691 --> 01:49:57,640
Like your mom,
like we're going to go in here and fight

2673
01:49:57,650 --> 01:50:00,160
and fight the tj and I bring.
It's going to be.

2674
01:50:00,161 --> 01:50:01,330
I hope it's a phone booth,
you know,

2675
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:02,270
I hope it,
you know,

2676
01:50:02,270 --> 01:50:03,130
standard trade.
Let's,

2677
01:50:03,400 --> 01:50:05,350
let's see.
I don't know how he's gonna you know,

2678
01:50:05,480 --> 01:50:07,450
because he knows my skills and knows 
that I have,

2679
01:50:07,830 --> 01:50:08,663
you know,
lilly have gotten so much better since 

2680
01:50:10,481 --> 01:50:11,314
then.
I was still getting the better of him 

2681
01:50:13,130 --> 01:50:15,220
and I'm not saying this to toot my own 
horn or whatever.

2682
01:50:15,221 --> 01:50:16,054
It's the gym.
But you're as competitive as he isn't 

2683
01:50:18,250 --> 01:50:19,083
competitive.
I am.

2684
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:20,740
You're not going to give an edge in 
practice.

2685
01:50:20,741 --> 01:50:21,820
I don't give them an edge of practice.

2686
01:50:21,820 --> 01:50:23,800
Favorite takes me down.
We're going again.

2687
01:50:23,801 --> 01:50:24,571
You know,
it was vice versa.

2688
01:50:24,571 --> 01:50:27,820
I'd take favorite down like oh it's 
overtime we go 40 minutes after.

2689
01:50:27,830 --> 01:50:28,663
Sometimes it's like this guy's one of 
the hardest guys a break because he's 

2690
01:50:30,881 --> 01:50:34,930
just obviously too dumb to know he tired
or stopped going.

2691
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:39,130
Like someone like we were just talking 
about that and now he's retired.

2692
01:50:39,131 --> 01:50:42,160
So he comes in like these guys are like,
fresh off is all fresh,

2693
01:50:42,161 --> 01:50:42,994
but it comes in like,
this guy's retired like fuck favorite 

2694
01:50:45,140 --> 01:50:46,960
man,
this guy is breaking these younger dudes

2695
01:50:46,961 --> 01:50:49,870
that are killers themselves because he 
just has that mentality.

2696
01:50:49,871 --> 01:50:52,690
It's a different breed.
And that's what I'm like.

2697
01:50:52,691 --> 01:50:54,640
I said tj,
he's that breed.

2698
01:50:55,110 --> 01:50:57,160
He is at that point,
you know,

2699
01:50:57,161 --> 01:51:01,780
he's an alpha male guy.
And fortunately for me,

2700
01:51:01,781 --> 01:51:02,614
I feel like you could ever reckoned in 
style or do you feel like he's crossed 

2701
01:51:05,711 --> 01:51:08,500
the line into some weird sort of area?
Right.

2702
01:51:08,630 --> 01:51:10,780
Did so much defending of that guy 
because of,

2703
01:51:11,540 --> 01:51:12,373
you know,
whatever his thing is here and this and 

2704
01:51:13,911 --> 01:51:14,744
that.
And I have a lot of great friends that 

2705
01:51:16,971 --> 01:51:20,060
are newer.
I mean like cody's newer in my life,

2706
01:51:20,061 --> 01:51:20,894
but we've got a bond.
I've got friends that I've had since I 

2707
01:51:23,841 --> 01:51:27,950
was like kindergarten and before 
kindergarten and drawing up together,

2708
01:51:27,951 --> 01:51:28,784
you know,
in my community in like I've got great 

2709
01:51:31,221 --> 01:51:33,590
groups of friends.
So it's like,

2710
01:51:34,100 --> 01:51:34,933
I mean I can reconcile whatever just 
stopped lying about what actually 

2711
01:51:37,731 --> 01:51:38,564
happened to save your face is like I'd 
never kicked the guy off of a team or 

2712
01:51:42,501 --> 01:51:43,334
anything and then he gets a one 
opportunity on national television to 

2713
01:51:46,281 --> 01:51:48,590
say something about me.
That's my only qualm with the guy.

2714
01:51:48,950 --> 01:51:51,410
I didn't like dwayne because of the 
things that he had done.

2715
01:51:51,830 --> 01:51:53,230
But tj and I will always work

2716
01:51:53,560 --> 01:51:54,393
because work is that people making the 
weirdest things about running a jam and 

2717
01:51:58,081 --> 01:52:00,570
running a camp is a,
you kind of have to manage,

2718
01:52:00,590 --> 01:52:03,830
you have to be like a psychologist.
Personality did.

2719
01:52:04,090 --> 01:52:08,280
A lot of fighters are prima donnas and 
you do not just a trainer,

2720
01:52:08,310 --> 01:52:09,143
not just a teammate but you also a 
psychologist and some sort of a 

2721
01:52:12,861 --> 01:52:13,694
counseling

2722
01:52:13,960 --> 01:52:15,460
be glue.
Which and when I,

2723
01:52:15,470 --> 01:52:16,303
I honestly,
I'm just learning this more and more 

2724
01:52:18,020 --> 01:52:21,380
when I stepped out of the,
the area too much.

2725
01:52:21,590 --> 01:52:22,423
It's like,
I mean I have to come back in and put 

2726
01:52:24,501 --> 01:52:26,360
out fires and bring everyone back 
together.

2727
01:52:26,361 --> 01:52:28,730
And that's,
I would say that's one of my skills is,

2728
01:52:29,030 --> 01:52:33,260
is getting along with people and making 
things mesh and in finding a culture and

2729
01:52:33,261 --> 01:52:38,060
building like a healthy environment and 
that can get tweaked so easily.

2730
01:52:38,061 --> 01:52:39,770
It's crazy.
It's cancer.

2731
01:52:39,830 --> 01:52:40,663
Yeah.
And now jUstin buchholz is your main 

2732
01:52:41,991 --> 01:52:42,711
trainer now,
right?

2733
01:52:42,711 --> 01:52:43,360
He's like,
yeah,

2734
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:43,830
we.
Well,

2735
01:52:43,830 --> 01:52:44,663
we've gone to now is we have,
we have like a whole staff of main 

2736
01:52:48,921 --> 01:52:52,300
trainers because we have so many fires.
I mean we just had sage northcutt yeah,

2737
01:52:52,310 --> 01:52:55,010
year rodriguez and Sarah Mcmahon or in 
the gym right now.

2738
01:52:55,400 --> 01:52:56,630
and,
and uh,

2739
01:52:56,870 --> 01:52:57,703
you know,
rick glen is about to go and he's a new 

2740
01:52:59,031 --> 01:53:00,730
guy to the team and we've got,
you know,

2741
01:53:00,740 --> 01:53:02,690
darren elkins,
so we have different guys.

2742
01:53:02,691 --> 01:53:05,010
Like danny castillo is a head coach,
chris holders,

2743
01:53:05,011 --> 01:53:07,910
the head coach,
coach joey rodriguez as a head coach.

2744
01:53:08,120 --> 01:53:11,780
Danny castillo is a head coach.
We have fabio prado who's a coach,

2745
01:53:12,040 --> 01:53:12,873
a dustin bari,
and those guys have been with us for 14 

2746
01:53:15,681 --> 01:53:16,700
years,
13 years.

2747
01:53:16,940 --> 01:53:18,920
And I'm,
I'm in a lead position as a coach.

2748
01:53:18,921 --> 01:53:19,754
I run,
I run practices and oversee things and 

2749
01:53:21,921 --> 01:53:23,260
coordinate things.
So it's a,

2750
01:53:23,470 --> 01:53:24,303
it's a big co op and different people 
have different coaches that are like 

2751
01:53:26,780 --> 01:53:28,680
their main gig and you know,
different

2752
01:53:29,020 --> 01:53:30,620
is still fairly young too.
Right.

2753
01:53:30,621 --> 01:53:32,060
Hold justin.
So 34.

2754
01:53:32,100 --> 01:53:33,350
Yeah,
he's 35 I think.

2755
01:53:34,060 --> 01:53:35,660
Is he completely done competing?

2756
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:39,020
That's a great question.
You never know with,

2757
01:53:39,050 --> 01:53:40,400
with the fight game,
you know what I mean?

2758
01:53:40,790 --> 01:53:43,340
It only takes a yes to be back in the 
fight game.

2759
01:53:43,341 --> 01:53:43,720
But yeah,

2760
01:53:43,720 --> 01:53:46,840
sometimes guys when they coach they also
feel like they're getting better because

2761
01:53:46,841 --> 01:53:47,674
they understand things more.
You see that a lot with jujitsu 

2762
01:53:50,441 --> 01:53:53,290
competitors or at times coaching makes 
them a better fighter.

2763
01:53:53,430 --> 01:53:55,230
Absolutely.
Yeah.

2764
01:53:55,550 --> 01:53:56,970
I don't know if they'll,
if they'll come back,

2765
01:53:56,971 --> 01:53:57,804
but I mean what we've got is a great co 
op and it's always a struggle to keep 

2766
01:54:01,621 --> 01:54:03,030
things because there's going to be 
cliques,

2767
01:54:03,300 --> 01:54:06,350
there's going to be the potheads and the
nerds and the fucking

2768
01:54:06,470 --> 01:54:08,740
jocks and like,
you know,

2769
01:54:08,741 --> 01:54:09,574
whatever can dope.
Are you enjoying it still all these 

2770
01:54:14,181 --> 01:54:15,014
years in the game?

2771
01:54:15,180 --> 01:54:15,931
Did it.
You know what I,

2772
01:54:15,931 --> 01:54:17,820
you know what it is.
It was awesome.

2773
01:54:18,150 --> 01:54:23,150
I went to Mexico city and I miss chad's 
wedding to go and chad's my boy.

2774
01:54:23,791 --> 01:54:25,470
I love chatting,
love abby,

2775
01:54:25,471 --> 01:54:26,820
his wife,
and it was,

2776
01:54:26,910 --> 01:54:29,520
I know I miss a great time,
but I got to go corner.

2777
01:54:29,521 --> 01:54:32,180
Joseph miralis,
who's been with me since he isn't,

2778
01:54:32,210 --> 01:54:34,570
he's the oldest member of our team.
Wow.

2779
01:54:34,680 --> 01:54:38,880
He's been with us the longest and he's,
he's nine years old when he started with

2780
01:54:38,881 --> 01:54:39,900
us,
that's crazy.

2781
01:54:39,901 --> 01:54:40,820
And he,
you know,

2782
01:54:41,370 --> 01:54:42,203
like danny castillo is,
it was me and danny castillo and our 

2783
01:54:44,281 --> 01:54:45,114
coach joey in his corner and danny was 
getting all teared up like we all got 

2784
01:54:48,001 --> 01:54:48,834
teared up right before the fight,
like we brought it in and everyone's 

2785
01:54:50,851 --> 01:54:54,420
kinda crying and everything.
And like joseph,

2786
01:54:54,450 --> 01:54:55,970
I mean,
he's been through his struggles.

2787
01:54:55,980 --> 01:54:57,630
I went when he was going through a hard 
time,

2788
01:54:57,631 --> 01:55:00,540
I took him to the front row of a,
you know,

2789
01:55:00,541 --> 01:55:02,100
the ufc and,
and just,

2790
01:55:02,310 --> 01:55:03,143
you know,
putting right there and let them 

2791
01:55:03,391 --> 01:55:05,040
visualize.
and so that's,

2792
01:55:05,070 --> 01:55:06,150
that's the stuff I enjoy

2793
01:55:06,520 --> 01:55:07,210
now.
Uh,

2794
01:55:07,210 --> 01:55:09,100
you guys had your ear and camp?
Huh?

2795
01:55:09,550 --> 01:55:11,710
What else?
What a crazy animal house right now.

2796
01:55:11,711 --> 01:55:14,250
He's all by himself and big old house.
What a crazy style.

2797
01:55:14,251 --> 01:55:15,070
That guy's couch,
dude,

2798
01:55:15,070 --> 01:55:19,680
he's telling is a really talented guy.
Weird style to ryan like that.

2799
01:55:19,960 --> 01:55:21,460
Taekwondo based.
Yeah.

2800
01:55:21,550 --> 01:55:22,383
Kicking and wild shit.
Like when he hit bj penn with a 

2801
01:55:24,710 --> 01:55:27,650
threesixty roundhouse kick to the face.
Like go.

2802
01:55:27,660 --> 01:55:29,170
Okay.
Yeah,

2803
01:55:29,290 --> 01:55:31,230
he's crazy.
it's crazy.

2804
01:55:31,250 --> 01:55:32,380
Yeah.
That's a good range.

2805
01:55:32,990 --> 01:55:34,260
Even said that he's hands,
you know,

2806
01:55:34,261 --> 01:55:37,540
I'm not so good with the range and like 
knowing like my kicks,

2807
01:55:37,541 --> 01:55:39,940
I'm real accurate with his kicks and he 
says I kick harder and stuff.

2808
01:55:40,310 --> 01:55:44,030
I think that he feels like he's more 
accurate with this ass kicks

2809
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:45,300
and he is with his hands

2810
01:55:46,390 --> 01:55:49,660
quinces if he's not doing it with 
someone who's also a great kicker,

2811
01:55:49,680 --> 01:55:50,513
you know,
because he's able to operate in a range 

2812
01:55:51,551 --> 01:55:53,920
where he's pretty effective and most 
people aren't.

2813
01:55:54,010 --> 01:55:55,840
Yeah.
So he's a long kIcker too.

2814
01:55:56,170 --> 01:55:57,003
Has been staying.
He's been staying at my house the last 

2815
01:55:58,860 --> 01:56:01,180
like week and it's,
I'm getting to know him a lot.

2816
01:56:01,210 --> 01:56:02,380
I mean,
what a cool dude.

2817
01:56:02,410 --> 01:56:05,110
I mean that guy is very smart,
very smart.

2818
01:56:05,140 --> 01:56:07,060
Is like well put together.
He's,

2819
01:56:07,460 --> 01:56:11,920
I got to hear a little bit about like 
the townies from chihuahua in Mexico and

2820
01:56:11,921 --> 01:56:12,754
like it's a pretty,
pretty scary place and in kind of his 

2821
01:56:15,431 --> 01:56:16,264
journey as a,
as a young kid is one of the top karate 

2822
01:56:18,341 --> 01:56:19,174
guys in Mexico,
so he's been a competItor for a long 

2823
01:56:22,421 --> 01:56:23,254
time.
Used to have a coach that used to like 

2824
01:56:24,370 --> 01:56:25,203
hit him with a stick.
So they left that place and the guy 

2825
01:56:26,651 --> 01:56:29,740
called him back and was like,
can you please come back and I won't hit

2826
01:56:29,750 --> 01:56:30,780
you with it?
Yeah.

2827
01:56:30,790 --> 01:56:32,350
What he was like seven and eight.
Well,

2828
01:56:32,500 --> 01:56:33,910
jesus christ,
he's been,

2829
01:56:33,911 --> 01:56:36,280
uh,
he's been in a combat sport

2830
01:56:36,300 --> 01:56:36,960
for awhile.
Yeah,

2831
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:40,440
I think that frankie edgar fight was a 
very tough fight for him,

2832
01:56:40,470 --> 01:56:41,303
but a good fight as far as a learning 
experience and a lot of people had said 

2833
01:56:44,971 --> 01:56:46,560
that.
And I was one of the ones that said it,

2834
01:56:46,561 --> 01:56:49,080
like we'll see what happens when he 
fights a great wrestler.

2835
01:56:49,270 --> 01:56:50,103
Right.
That's going to be the real issue with 

2836
01:56:50,521 --> 01:56:52,890
him because he's got all this wild 
kicking stuff,

2837
01:56:53,340 --> 01:56:55,890
but that stuff doesn't work if somebody 
grabs a hold of you.

2838
01:56:56,070 --> 01:56:57,240
Right.
And if somebody.

2839
01:56:57,310 --> 01:56:58,780
Frank frank.
Yeah.

2840
01:56:58,910 --> 01:56:59,360
Yeah.

2841
01:56:59,360 --> 01:57:03,530
Frank at a different level of guys.
He's a great mixing it together.

2842
01:57:03,590 --> 01:57:04,423
So yeah,
a year hIs wrestling because I got to 

2843
01:57:07,011 --> 01:57:07,844
wrestle in the other.
He actually post a little video of us 

2844
01:57:08,961 --> 01:57:11,690
wrestling,
but his wrestling is good.

2845
01:57:11,750 --> 01:57:15,650
It's just like connor connor's wrestling
or boxing is really good.

2846
01:57:16,040 --> 01:57:18,410
It's just not floyd mayweather.
Good.

2847
01:57:18,460 --> 01:57:20,510
Right in the later rounds,
you know,

2848
01:57:20,511 --> 01:57:21,890
so like,
yeah,

2849
01:57:21,910 --> 01:57:24,680
years made a lot of gains he wouldn't 
share with izzy,

2850
01:57:24,770 --> 01:57:27,140
izzy,
Israel martinez who put him through like

2851
01:57:27,141 --> 01:57:27,860
uh,
you know,

2852
01:57:27,860 --> 01:57:29,360
he's a great coach.
Israel.

2853
01:57:29,380 --> 01:57:30,680
Very good.
And he uh,

2854
01:57:30,890 --> 01:57:34,280
he put them through a,
like a whole year of wrestling.

2855
01:57:34,281 --> 01:57:36,680
So his wrestling is top notch,
but it's not,

2856
01:57:38,030 --> 01:57:40,360
you know,
it needs to get to another break,

2857
01:57:40,520 --> 01:57:41,353
jaeger level when you're a little bit 
fatigued and you make a small mistake 

2858
01:57:44,811 --> 01:57:46,790
and the guy can capitalize,
but it's getting there.

2859
01:57:47,370 --> 01:57:48,203
No.

2860
01:57:48,640 --> 01:57:49,510
Yeah,
It's uh,

2861
01:57:49,520 --> 01:57:52,250
it's interesting.
You see so many different approaches and

2862
01:57:52,251 --> 01:57:53,084
his approach is very unique and it's one
of the things that's exciting about him 

2863
01:57:55,580 --> 01:57:58,160
is that he's got that crazy wild kicking
style.

2864
01:57:58,310 --> 01:57:59,930
Yeah.
Throw everything.

2865
01:57:59,960 --> 01:58:02,690
Yeah.
A torpedo kicks all kinds of shit.

2866
01:58:02,860 --> 01:58:03,693
Yeah.
that's the guy I to mix up with because 

2867
01:58:04,491 --> 01:58:06,620
you don't see too many of those guys,
but once you run into him,

2868
01:58:06,690 --> 01:58:07,810
right?
Yeah.

2869
01:58:07,820 --> 01:58:08,860
You better get it right.

2870
01:58:09,250 --> 01:58:11,200
Fine.
It's good to watch him and feeling we're

2871
01:58:11,250 --> 01:58:11,810
trying,
you know,

2872
01:58:11,810 --> 01:58:14,470
he,
he got a win over feely,

2873
01:58:14,920 --> 01:58:16,660
but like he felt like,
ah man,

2874
01:58:16,661 --> 01:58:18,010
I was in that fight.
He just got caught.

2875
01:58:18,011 --> 01:58:18,844
He got popped in the orbital and then 
got like couldn't see and get switch 

2876
01:58:22,400 --> 01:58:24,760
kick to the dome.
And so fuel is like,

2877
01:58:24,761 --> 01:58:25,594
man,
it's fun to watch these guys come full 

2878
01:58:27,761 --> 01:58:28,510
circle,
like,

2879
01:58:28,510 --> 01:58:32,890
like b be feeling now they're chaining 
together in,

2880
01:58:32,920 --> 01:58:33,753
in working together a little bit.
And then darren elkins lost to Chad and 

2881
01:58:37,541 --> 01:58:38,374
darren elkins came to see us and and 
he's been on like a six by eight win 

2882
01:58:40,500 --> 01:58:42,110
streak.
That guy's frigging jam

2883
01:58:42,130 --> 01:58:42,963
dude on

2884
01:58:43,340 --> 01:58:44,173
back to it because one of the craziest 
moments have ever seen the guy getting 

2885
01:58:47,761 --> 01:58:48,594
his ass kicked for every fucking second 
of the first couple rounds and they 

2886
01:58:51,991 --> 01:58:53,560
finally gets a hold of them,
damn.

2887
01:58:53,580 --> 01:58:58,580
Beats them down and chaos and then just 
screams like all like a demon covered in

2888
01:58:58,771 --> 01:58:59,510
blood.

2889
01:58:59,510 --> 01:59:01,910
I was sitting there,
I left during the second round.

2890
01:59:01,911 --> 01:59:02,361
I was like,
man,

2891
01:59:02,361 --> 01:59:04,340
I can't watch this.
Like I don't like watch my friends.

2892
01:59:04,350 --> 01:59:05,183
Then.
Especially when it's shit like that 

2893
01:59:05,511 --> 01:59:05,931
happens.
I'm like,

2894
01:59:05,931 --> 01:59:07,910
I walked out,
the next thing you know,

2895
01:59:08,390 --> 01:59:10,790
the place goes nuts and I see elkins 
knocked him out.

2896
01:59:10,791 --> 01:59:11,331
I was like,
cool.

2897
01:59:11,331 --> 01:59:12,140
I like it.
That kid,

2898
01:59:12,140 --> 01:59:17,140
you got to honestly stop elkins.
You have to knock them off.

2899
01:59:17,601 --> 01:59:18,890
Yeah,
for sure.

2900
01:59:18,891 --> 01:59:20,930
I mean,
tough elkins is the,

2901
01:59:21,260 --> 01:59:25,720
the like the pillar of consistency.
He's always in the.

2902
01:59:25,850 --> 01:59:29,240
He's always at every practice listens to
every coach.

2903
01:59:29,450 --> 01:59:33,260
He'd going hard.
We have these two and brothers that come

2904
01:59:33,261 --> 01:59:35,240
in there.
They're from chechnya.

2905
01:59:35,241 --> 01:59:36,074
They're really talented guys.
I'm actually going to go corner to the 

2906
01:59:37,611 --> 01:59:39,990
guys over in Ukraine,
but uh,

2907
01:59:40,150 --> 01:59:40,983
there are super skilled fighters but 
don't have that drive and like we have 

2908
01:59:45,861 --> 01:59:48,560
here and so they keep popping him,
boom,

2909
01:59:48,561 --> 01:59:49,330
boom,
boom.

2910
01:59:49,330 --> 01:59:50,163
And then d and then they keep tryIng to 
call time out and they catch him with a 

2911
01:59:52,761 --> 01:59:55,000
couple of things in elkins chased now 
they go,

2912
01:59:55,020 --> 01:59:57,960
oh you are,
you're not taking the time.

2913
01:59:57,961 --> 02:00:00,800
l oh,
grabs the guy.

2914
02:00:00,920 --> 02:00:04,970
Why did they try to take time?
Because they get tired of that shit.

2915
02:00:05,730 --> 02:00:06,740
Don't be pop,
pop.

2916
02:00:06,890 --> 02:00:08,660
Just flap his head.
I'll fly back,

2917
02:00:08,661 --> 02:00:10,790
boom.
Hit them there and kick him in the leg.

2918
02:00:10,791 --> 02:00:13,720
And he's lIke,
he's like,

2919
02:00:13,760 --> 02:00:14,593
he got,
catches him with something and like 

2920
02:00:15,300 --> 02:00:16,670
grabs like time,
timeouts that man.

2921
02:00:16,671 --> 02:00:17,504
He's like,
oh fuck that motherfucker no time now 

2922
02:00:20,330 --> 02:00:21,380
because it's a grinder

2923
02:00:22,820 --> 02:00:24,740
great against dennis bermudez.
That's a big win,

2924
02:00:24,850 --> 02:00:27,620
a big win and he looks smooth and that's
fine.

2925
02:00:27,770 --> 02:00:30,650
He didn't take as much damage,
the names of damage for a reason because

2926
02:00:30,651 --> 02:00:32,870
he gets somebody to also like the way 
his.

2927
02:00:32,930 --> 02:00:36,980
He's moving looks better ways.
Kicking and punching his combinations.

2928
02:00:37,220 --> 02:00:38,053
He looks like he's got less extra steps.
It's like this all smoothness and his 

2929
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:43,580
transitions in his movement.

2930
02:00:43,700 --> 02:00:44,533
That's what I've been working on in.
Go ahead and I think a lot of that has 

2931
02:00:46,580 --> 02:00:48,490
to do with obviously working the 
footwork,

2932
02:00:48,500 --> 02:00:49,333
like these guys,
some of these guys that are straight 

2933
02:00:49,761 --> 02:00:51,100
wrestlers and then like,
all right,

2934
02:00:51,101 --> 02:00:53,690
we're going to wrestle and throw punches
and try to take you down.

2935
02:00:53,691 --> 02:00:57,140
But your footwork is the core of 
everything.

2936
02:00:57,141 --> 02:00:58,580
Yeah,
you can have throw good hands,

2937
02:00:58,581 --> 02:01:00,530
but if your feet are out of position or 
getting taken down,

2938
02:01:00,890 --> 02:01:03,140
you know you're.
You're not gonna land power punches.

2939
02:01:03,290 --> 02:01:04,410
So the footwork,
I,

2940
02:01:04,490 --> 02:01:09,220
I religiously work on footwork daily.
Like this will work.

2941
02:01:09,290 --> 02:01:10,350
That's dominant.

2942
02:01:10,410 --> 02:01:14,010
I mean that is his entire thing is his 
ability to move.

2943
02:01:14,011 --> 02:01:16,320
It's just so unusual as footwork.
So we're.

2944
02:01:16,900 --> 02:01:17,733
That's one of the things where you went 
toe for toe for toe to toe with them 

2945
02:01:21,120 --> 02:01:23,610
when you're,
your footwork was equally as good as his

2946
02:01:23,611 --> 02:01:25,710
is not better and you were landing 
harder.

2947
02:01:25,711 --> 02:01:26,500
Combination

2948
02:01:26,500 --> 02:01:27,333
for us to master tang was all about 
footwork and biomechanics and he's back 

2949
02:01:31,871 --> 02:01:32,704
in Thailand now and then that's been 
passed on to our next generation of 

2950
02:01:34,751 --> 02:01:36,130
coaches from.
He moved back.

2951
02:01:36,460 --> 02:01:39,740
He did move back after 11 years.
Why did he decide to back to silent?

2952
02:01:39,800 --> 02:01:40,040
Became

2953
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:43,430
a monk for a day.
It came up for a day because because his

2954
02:01:43,460 --> 02:01:44,293
parents had died,
if you don't go and live in the 

2955
02:01:46,371 --> 02:01:51,371
monastery for within a year and a half 
after he hadn't seen his son in 11 years

2956
02:01:52,171 --> 02:01:54,650
since sentras for.
And he,

2957
02:01:54,710 --> 02:01:55,543
I mean he spent all his time facetiming 
with his family and he wasn't 

2958
02:01:57,591 --> 02:02:01,160
necessarily allowed back in the.
He went and he went back,

2959
02:02:01,161 --> 02:02:02,030
he stuck back.

2960
02:02:02,050 --> 02:02:04,080
He wasn't allowed pack.
How come?

2961
02:02:04,570 --> 02:02:06,660
Illegal.
Oh,

2962
02:02:06,960 --> 02:02:07,793
oh.
So he couldn't come back to America if 

2963
02:02:09,071 --> 02:02:10,240
you went back to Thailand?
Yeah.

2964
02:02:10,370 --> 02:02:11,630
Yeah.
so when he was gone,

2965
02:02:11,631 --> 02:02:13,130
he was gone because he overstayed a 
visa.

2966
02:02:14,660 --> 02:02:15,650
So he,
uh,

2967
02:02:16,070 --> 02:02:17,420
yeah.
So that's one universal.

2968
02:02:17,510 --> 02:02:19,910
When you saw tj dillashaw my corner in 
Canada,

2969
02:02:20,420 --> 02:02:23,690
that's because master tom couldn't go to
Canada and tj knew everything.

2970
02:02:23,691 --> 02:02:25,840
Every single thing that,
that,

2971
02:02:25,940 --> 02:02:28,210
that mastered tongue,
like knew all his,

2972
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:29,690
his stuff,
get a hold mitts,

2973
02:02:30,080 --> 02:02:32,050
but he was all about that now.
Which,

2974
02:02:32,090 --> 02:02:32,923
see,
that's what's great about having all 

2975
02:02:33,351 --> 02:02:36,260
these coaches like justin buckles,
he knows,

2976
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:40,970
he knows master tongs style.
He knows my style.

2977
02:02:40,971 --> 02:02:42,560
He knows,
uh,

2978
02:02:42,590 --> 02:02:44,780
every coach you've ever had In their 
dwayne style.

2979
02:02:44,781 --> 02:02:46,010
He knows,
you know,

2980
02:02:46,160 --> 02:02:47,660
anybody.
Dimitri [inaudible],

2981
02:02:48,780 --> 02:02:51,080
dimitri made dominic style.
Anybody that's been in here,

2982
02:02:51,081 --> 02:02:56,000
he knows bob,
bob's my uncle bob's style.

2983
02:02:56,330 --> 02:03:00,830
And so you get a guy like darren elkins,
it needs to work on that striking and we

2984
02:03:00,831 --> 02:03:03,980
put them with justin buckles and you 
know,

2985
02:03:03,981 --> 02:03:04,814
with the cumulative part of the team,
it works wonders and then you get a guy 

2986
02:03:08,001 --> 02:03:08,371
like,
yeah,

2987
02:03:08,371 --> 02:03:09,204
a year who comes in with this striking 
background and now we've got all these 

2988
02:03:11,781 --> 02:03:12,614
different attributes or like a sage 
northcutt who's with us right now that 

2989
02:03:15,010 --> 02:03:15,843
guys,
hey,

2990
02:03:16,190 --> 02:03:18,110
let's take a moment to acknowledge sage.

2991
02:03:18,110 --> 02:03:19,790
NortHcutt is the nicest guy in the 
planet.

2992
02:03:19,791 --> 02:03:20,624
Yeah,

2993
02:03:22,910 --> 02:03:25,310
definitely.
Like the nicest dude on the planet.

2994
02:03:25,340 --> 02:03:28,940
I got into the ufc too quick,
just like a little bit,

2995
02:03:28,941 --> 02:03:29,774
but it doesn't matter.
I super talented and was looking really 

2996
02:03:32,391 --> 02:03:33,224
good in some small organizations,
but really didn't have a complete game 

2997
02:03:35,331 --> 02:03:36,350
yet.
I'm going to tell you,

2998
02:03:36,351 --> 02:03:38,210
he learns really,
really fast.

2999
02:03:38,211 --> 02:03:40,580
I always mess.
I was a mess with cody.

3000
02:03:40,610 --> 02:03:42,890
I was getting this kind of like,
man,

3001
02:03:42,891 --> 02:03:46,670
sage lillian's a lot faster than you.
It's not really the case.

3002
02:03:46,671 --> 02:03:50,450
I just like to fuck with this guy.
But a dozen st mark's sister.

3003
02:03:50,451 --> 02:03:52,990
That's her karate competitor.
GotcHa.

3004
02:03:53,150 --> 02:03:53,983
Yep.
She just shook her first fight and she 

3005
02:03:56,481 --> 02:03:58,430
lost.
Uh,

3006
02:03:58,431 --> 02:03:59,200
but she,
she,

3007
02:03:59,200 --> 02:04:01,490
she asked some potential too.
That's interesting.

3008
02:04:01,640 --> 02:04:04,250
So he's a,
he's a fun case,

3009
02:04:04,251 --> 02:04:06,800
you know,
because he's got that weIrd karate style

3010
02:04:07,020 --> 02:04:07,853
super fast too though.
I mean you would know it but he's got a 

3011
02:04:11,601 --> 02:04:13,010
little mean streak and he's,
he's,

3012
02:04:13,040 --> 02:04:15,740
he's got all the knowledge like 
everybody because he's nice.

3013
02:04:15,750 --> 02:04:18,170
Everybody wants to help the guy and he 
is so nice.

3014
02:04:18,171 --> 02:04:19,550
It was just like,
oh thank you.

3015
02:04:19,610 --> 02:04:21,410
Like just like learn from whoever tells 
them,

3016
02:04:21,411 --> 02:04:22,370
you know,
calls me,

3017
02:04:22,371 --> 02:04:23,270
mr.
Favre.

3018
02:04:26,300 --> 02:04:28,760
Mr.
Favor now when you guys do a camp,

3019
02:04:28,761 --> 02:04:32,360
lIke say you training for tj,
who organizes your camp?

3020
02:04:32,361 --> 02:04:35,360
Like how do you organize your strength 
and conditioning routine?

3021
02:04:35,570 --> 02:04:36,403
How do you organize,
like what are you going to do that day 

3022
02:04:37,951 --> 02:04:38,100
or

3023
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:40,710
do you do a base on how you feel like 
who is,

3024
02:04:40,711 --> 02:04:41,700
who is the coordinator?

3025
02:04:42,040 --> 02:04:43,630
Myself,
basically I kinda,

3026
02:04:43,760 --> 02:04:44,471
yeah,
that's what we do.

3027
02:04:44,471 --> 02:04:47,740
Like favorite always would preach about.
It's a lifestyle change.

3028
02:04:47,741 --> 02:04:50,350
Like if you need to do this much work 
you needed to do wrestling,

3029
02:04:50,410 --> 02:04:54,400
get get guys on the team and wrestle.
So I'll figure out what I need to do.

3030
02:04:54,401 --> 02:04:57,610
Especially for this fight with tj.
I know the specific work that I need,

3031
02:04:58,120 --> 02:04:59,140
combos,
what he throws,

3032
02:04:59,141 --> 02:05:00,400
what he likes to do,
it vice versa.

3033
02:05:00,610 --> 02:05:01,930
So I get with all my coaches like,
hey,

3034
02:05:01,931 --> 02:05:02,764
I would like to have this much work with
chris personally as much work with 

3035
02:05:06,700 --> 02:05:07,533
motion and movement with favor pad work.
I'm uncle come out and do pad work as 

3036
02:05:11,051 --> 02:05:11,884
well.
and then I get with my strength 

3037
02:05:12,551 --> 02:05:14,440
conditioning coach from going three 
times a week,

3038
02:05:15,530 --> 02:05:18,790
usually one heavy day to like movement,
foot work,

3039
02:05:18,791 --> 02:05:20,050
you know,
Greece in the body.

3040
02:05:20,350 --> 02:05:22,330
Uh,
so It's just always like usually on that

3041
02:05:22,331 --> 02:05:23,170
sunday and we're like,
hey,

3042
02:05:23,620 --> 02:05:25,030
we lay it out,
lay it out,

3043
02:05:25,031 --> 02:05:25,390
lay it out.

3044
02:05:25,390 --> 02:05:27,600
So will you lay out the whole week of 
events?

3045
02:05:27,780 --> 02:05:30,700
So like when you have a heavy day,
say if you ever like a rock 'em sock 'em

3046
02:05:30,701 --> 02:05:31,534
robots day the next day.
Do you like to do like a yoga stretch 

3047
02:05:35,351 --> 02:05:36,700
out,
do movement,

3048
02:05:36,760 --> 02:05:38,050
hit pads?
Like how do,

3049
02:05:38,110 --> 02:05:38,570
how do you work?

3050
02:05:38,570 --> 02:05:41,660
Okay.
I usually go sunday is kind of like a,

3051
02:05:42,970 --> 02:05:43,671
uh,
what do you call it?

3052
02:05:43,671 --> 02:05:47,570
Like a shakeout kind of active rest.
We're moving to that felt wherever.

3053
02:05:47,571 --> 02:05:48,060
yeah.
Yeah.

3054
02:05:48,060 --> 02:05:48,893
So I don't feel like garbage on monday.
Monday we hit it hard and usually 

3055
02:05:51,530 --> 02:05:53,580
morning practice or pad works in the 
afternoon.

3056
02:05:53,610 --> 02:05:54,443
Then jujitsu,
so it's usually three on mondays and 

3057
02:05:56,720 --> 02:05:59,570
tuesdays I usually just wrestle and 
maybe do some pad work because I like to

3058
02:05:59,571 --> 02:06:01,300
kind of be rested for sparring,
sparring.

3059
02:06:01,310 --> 02:06:02,143
So a lot of swearIng on wednesday.
And then I'll usually do a strength 

3060
02:06:05,871 --> 02:06:06,704
conditioning workout after sparring.
And on thursdays usually when I like no 

3061
02:06:09,561 --> 02:06:11,090
Impact day,
I usually kind of like,

3062
02:06:11,091 --> 02:06:11,924
it's wrestling.
Sometimes I'll go in there and just 

3063
02:06:12,561 --> 02:06:13,520
wrestle.
If I feel good,

3064
02:06:13,550 --> 02:06:14,383
I'll drill.
I won't go live and then I'll do like 

3065
02:06:16,400 --> 02:06:20,030
yoga or more.
My hyperbaric chambers have to go.

3066
02:06:20,360 --> 02:06:21,193
I had to go towards the end of the week 
after the sparring because friday's a 

3067
02:06:23,350 --> 02:06:25,730
intimate practice.
so it's like everything.

3068
02:06:25,731 --> 02:06:29,330
It's you're doing sparring and they are 
doing the grappling.

3069
02:06:29,510 --> 02:06:33,130
So is this trial and error that's led 
you to this schedule that gives you like

3070
02:06:33,230 --> 02:06:36,260
the thought to take thursday light and 
then go hard on friday?

3071
02:06:36,261 --> 02:06:38,420
Monday.
HArd sunday light?

3072
02:06:38,600 --> 02:06:39,433
Yeah.
This is what has worked for me since I 

3073
02:06:40,921 --> 02:06:43,380
said like I came out here.
Literally I was in,

3074
02:06:43,740 --> 02:06:47,750
I was doing my own strength conditioning
before I came out to team alpha male and

3075
02:06:47,751 --> 02:06:50,350
I was hitting pads is my uncle and I go 
in and inspire.

3076
02:06:50,370 --> 02:06:51,170
I wouldn't even,
it may,

3077
02:06:51,170 --> 02:06:52,003
I would do boxing would take downs.
That's all we do because a lot of the 

3078
02:06:54,511 --> 02:06:57,180
boxers I was with russell or you know 
what I mean?

3079
02:06:57,181 --> 02:06:58,740
So they would do,
we would just do the boxing.

3080
02:06:58,890 --> 02:07:01,020
So we need do the boxes didn't want 
kicked.

3081
02:07:01,190 --> 02:07:02,460
Right.
So we're just doing that.

3082
02:07:02,461 --> 02:07:03,294
I get my work and I was working with pos
battle for a lot of these boxers and 

3083
02:07:06,990 --> 02:07:07,823
cleveland and pittsburgh and I finally 
came out here and these guys had it 

3084
02:07:11,130 --> 02:07:12,240
like,
man,

3085
02:07:12,241 --> 02:07:15,300
a system,
a system like wrestling system.

3086
02:07:15,420 --> 02:07:17,430
That's what I do so well beCause they do
the drilling.

3087
02:07:17,850 --> 02:07:18,683
You start out with this,
we're going to go wrestling and then 

3088
02:07:19,951 --> 02:07:22,520
we're going to go in the clinch back to 
strikes fit into like,

3089
02:07:22,530 --> 02:07:25,320
hey,
it's goes from this structure.

3090
02:07:25,550 --> 02:07:26,610
Yeah.
So I didn't,

3091
02:07:26,611 --> 02:07:27,444
I never knew knew any of that.
Like first time I really change your 

3092
02:07:29,040 --> 02:07:29,873
jitsu was out here,
like learning it and like blended 

3093
02:07:32,190 --> 02:07:34,020
together.
I always said I was a good athlete,

3094
02:07:34,021 --> 02:07:35,540
a good wrestler,
good fight.

3095
02:07:35,630 --> 02:07:36,463
A good boxer by I my own news style here
with like going and doing really the 

3096
02:07:42,011 --> 02:07:45,340
first year that I was here I was just 
training like for like,

3097
02:07:45,660 --> 02:07:46,890
yeah,
he actually told me,

3098
02:07:46,891 --> 02:07:47,724
he's like,
bro,

3099
02:07:48,030 --> 02:07:49,730
this is like a little,
you know,

3100
02:07:49,731 --> 02:07:51,960
we had to tone it back a little bit.
Which like I said,

3101
02:07:52,530 --> 02:07:56,400
we have.
The team was built on overtraining.

3102
02:07:56,550 --> 02:08:00,750
It was like I didn't take a vacation for
seven years when I started fighting.

3103
02:08:01,320 --> 02:08:03,240
I mean I never took vacations growing up
either.

3104
02:08:03,241 --> 02:08:05,190
We didn't have money.
It wasn't like something that we did,

3105
02:08:05,191 --> 02:08:06,300
so I'm not like used to like,
oh,

3106
02:08:06,301 --> 02:08:07,134
we're taking a vacation,
but like seven years I didn't take a 

3107
02:08:09,181 --> 02:08:11,490
vacation.
And so it was like this grind,

3108
02:08:11,491 --> 02:08:12,121
grind,
grind,

3109
02:08:12,121 --> 02:08:13,570
and everybody's kind of keeping up and 
we've,

3110
02:08:13,630 --> 02:08:17,190
we've shifted and gotten smarter and 
have more input and etc.

3111
02:08:17,200 --> 02:08:19,560
Etc.
But the bottom line for me is this,

3112
02:08:19,830 --> 02:08:22,740
we have a lot of advisors,
right?

3113
02:08:22,741 --> 02:08:24,870
And I like it.
Sage northcutts a great example.

3114
02:08:24,990 --> 02:08:26,070
He can,
he'll,

3115
02:08:26,100 --> 02:08:30,960
he'll listen to whoever's talking to him
and like people want to talk to them all

3116
02:08:30,961 --> 02:08:32,010
the time and tell him what to do.

3117
02:08:32,010 --> 02:08:34,240
Right?
So like there's advise,

3118
02:08:34,310 --> 02:08:35,940
there's an advisory,
like we say,

3119
02:08:35,941 --> 02:08:37,530
hey,
this is the coaches and I think that you

3120
02:08:37,531 --> 02:08:40,260
need to do this and we need to do that.
But you have to be,

3121
02:08:40,261 --> 02:08:41,094
especially at a high level like this,
you have to be a thermometer for your 

3122
02:08:44,161 --> 02:08:46,020
own,
for your own stuff as well.

3123
02:08:46,021 --> 02:08:48,510
So we have set practices throughout the 
day,

3124
02:08:48,511 --> 02:08:51,210
but if you're feeling way too beat up,
you know,

3125
02:08:51,211 --> 02:08:52,044
because we're not worried about guys not
showing up to practice because they're 

3126
02:08:55,321 --> 02:08:58,340
lazy.
We have the best athletes in the world,

3127
02:08:58,350 --> 02:09:00,810
the rIght mentality.
We trusted the mentality and the and the

3128
02:09:00,850 --> 02:09:02,370
purposes they're in.
Right?

3129
02:09:02,670 --> 02:09:03,503
So if you're feeling too much,
you got to let us know and we'll take a 

3130
02:09:05,761 --> 02:09:06,594
little back and do it there.
And so this is kind of what we found 

3131
02:09:07,951 --> 02:09:09,460
for,
for him as well.

3132
02:09:09,510 --> 02:09:10,343
No,
when you're scheduling everything 

3133
02:09:11,191 --> 02:09:12,024
yourself,
like there's two schools of thought on 

3134
02:09:12,961 --> 02:09:13,794
that.
There's one school of thought that says 

3135
02:09:15,031 --> 02:09:17,400
someone should be overseeing everything 
for you.

3136
02:09:17,401 --> 02:09:17,940
So you're not

3137
02:09:17,940 --> 02:09:20,780
telling you what to do.
Scheduling is one thing,

3138
02:09:21,020 --> 02:09:24,010
but what's your scheduling?
Scheduling something with a coach.

3139
02:09:24,011 --> 02:09:27,530
He's got a strength and conditioning and
a physical therapists that are making.

3140
02:09:27,650 --> 02:09:30,200
Taking that part of his thing.
He's got,

3141
02:09:30,230 --> 02:09:31,063
you know,
us as head coaches over looking saying 

3142
02:09:33,351 --> 02:09:34,820
hey,
we need to make sure that you're getting

3143
02:09:34,821 --> 02:09:35,450
your,
you know,

3144
02:09:35,450 --> 02:09:36,283
this end.
But there's coaches every single time 

3145
02:09:37,701 --> 02:09:38,534
for that.
It's not like you're just on your own 

3146
02:09:39,141 --> 02:09:39,974
doing your course.

3147
02:09:40,030 --> 02:09:41,670
Right.
Some people do do it that way.

3148
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:43,770
Some people like to do everything on 
their own,

3149
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:44,633
which is interesting.
Some people would just like to be told 

3150
02:09:45,691 --> 02:09:48,390
what to do.
Just you're going to do this.

3151
02:09:48,450 --> 02:09:49,260
Exactly.
Yeah,

3152
02:09:49,260 --> 02:09:50,580
but that.
That goes away.

3153
02:09:50,581 --> 02:09:53,480
Which ones somebody fucks you up.
You know what I mean?

3154
02:09:53,850 --> 02:09:54,980
Yeah.
Like my,

3155
02:09:55,110 --> 02:09:58,690
my australian positionIng coaches,
pt coaches with my mma coach,

3156
02:09:58,750 --> 02:10:00,150
they're all in like coordinates like,
okay,

3157
02:10:00,151 --> 02:10:02,460
we went heavy with this.
We should ease back this,

3158
02:10:02,461 --> 02:10:03,810
maybe do this many rounds.
So,

3159
02:10:04,440 --> 02:10:07,420
but that's just started doing that.
I think for the cruise by the first time

3160
02:10:07,421 --> 02:10:10,170
we were a heart rate monitor and try to 
track where my heart rate was at.

3161
02:10:10,210 --> 02:10:11,043
Was getting up high in the 80 
[inaudible] trying to bring it back 

3162
02:10:13,681 --> 02:10:14,514
down.
That's the first time I ever done that 

3163
02:10:15,451 --> 02:10:17,440
because what you what?
So like when you're doing that,

3164
02:10:17,441 --> 02:10:19,080
are you doing that for strength and 
conditioning?

3165
02:10:19,081 --> 02:10:20,440
Are you doing that?
Holding paths,

3166
02:10:20,450 --> 02:10:25,450
like how you that that was literally we 
would throw for a 90 seconds.

3167
02:10:25,561 --> 02:10:28,980
We would throw.
We do it for six rounds.

3168
02:10:29,510 --> 02:10:30,343
I would throw the same combo.
We had three or four different combos 

3169
02:10:32,191 --> 02:10:35,350
that we'd throw for 90 seconds and just 
keep the input up,

3170
02:10:35,360 --> 02:10:35,631
blah,
blah,

3171
02:10:35,631 --> 02:10:36,320
blah,
blah,

3172
02:10:36,320 --> 02:10:38,250
blah.
Ba ba ba bump ba bump,

3173
02:10:38,330 --> 02:10:39,163
four or five punch cabo with affairs,
with the kick or wherever the heart 

3174
02:10:42,741 --> 02:10:43,574
rate's,
get checked and then you wait until it 

3175
02:10:44,541 --> 02:10:48,830
gets down to what before you go again.
And then I think You would have 1:40

3176
02:10:48,831 --> 02:10:49,664
or something.

3177
02:10:51,690 --> 02:10:54,370
I was going to down I think lower than 
that one.

3178
02:10:54,590 --> 02:10:56,690
Ads.
So we do that time.

3179
02:10:56,810 --> 02:11:00,140
Have you've given yourself in recovery 
times in between?

3180
02:11:00,141 --> 02:11:01,680
In between rounds.
I,

3181
02:11:01,970 --> 02:11:02,803
I like to do 45 seconds because you 
think middle thing for 45 seconds I got 

3182
02:11:07,311 --> 02:11:11,120
another 15 seconds of you know,
recovering well usually you feel good at

3183
02:11:11,121 --> 02:11:11,901
30,
like I'm good.

3184
02:11:11,901 --> 02:11:15,830
I got 30 more seconds to to put it the 
45 and like in the fight you're like,

3185
02:11:15,831 --> 02:11:18,220
well because that that meant it goes 
fast as hell,

3186
02:11:18,240 --> 02:11:18,981
right?
Next thing you know,

3187
02:11:18,981 --> 02:11:21,130
you're talking to your coaches,
you got your bell rung,

3188
02:11:21,170 --> 02:11:23,780
get stitched her,
your eyes fixed,

3189
02:11:24,200 --> 02:11:28,460
and they back up there.
So it's like 45 seconds.

3190
02:11:28,461 --> 02:11:30,890
Let's keep going because that here you 
are,

3191
02:11:30,920 --> 02:11:32,110
you're 25,
right?

3192
02:11:32,660 --> 02:11:35,390
Twenty six,
2016 champion of the world.

3193
02:11:35,450 --> 02:11:37,850
When you look at your future,
you look at your,

3194
02:11:37,851 --> 02:11:39,500
like your potential future in the sport.

3195
02:11:39,500 --> 02:11:41,450
I mean you could be a gigantic fucking 
superstar.

3196
02:11:41,451 --> 02:11:43,340
You have the world is your oyster,
right?

3197
02:11:43,700 --> 02:11:45,740
Like how do you,
how do you plan on,

3198
02:11:45,760 --> 02:11:46,593
do you,
do you have like this sort of a master 

3199
02:11:48,711 --> 02:11:51,170
plan for your career?
You know,

3200
02:11:51,171 --> 02:11:52,004
what my goal is so long to be the world 
champion and I grind and towards the 

3201
02:11:56,961 --> 02:12:00,020
head that go,
I got that goal and I accomplished that.

3202
02:12:00,320 --> 02:12:01,153
And then it was boom,
right into the ultimate fighter boom 

3203
02:12:02,961 --> 02:12:05,760
injury boomed,
fight postponed.

3204
02:12:05,790 --> 02:12:07,610
So I was like,
I haven't been able to really,

3205
02:12:08,090 --> 02:12:09,340
really sat down because it's like,
well,

3206
02:12:09,341 --> 02:12:10,190
you know,
when you're in training,

3207
02:12:10,191 --> 02:12:11,360
you're focused on something.
For me,

3208
02:12:11,361 --> 02:12:13,160
I'm a creature of habit.
I like routine.

3209
02:12:13,520 --> 02:12:14,353
Um,
so we have just recently now sat down 

3210
02:12:16,250 --> 02:12:17,700
and like we've said about it,
you know,

3211
02:12:17,900 --> 02:12:18,733
everyone can win the championship,
everyone can be a world title to what 

3212
02:12:20,571 --> 02:12:21,404
you do at the title.

3213
02:12:21,500 --> 02:12:24,140
Now I've set these goals to build my 
legacy,

3214
02:12:24,190 --> 02:12:26,330
you know,
to start going on and who knows,

3215
02:12:26,331 --> 02:12:29,780
who knows what can happen in a year or 
so because I didn't think I was going to

3216
02:12:29,781 --> 02:12:30,471
be injured,
you know,

3217
02:12:30,471 --> 02:12:32,220
I never thought I'd be out this long,
you know,

3218
02:12:32,230 --> 02:12:33,063
that this is the most tiny time of my 
life because I couldn't do something 

3219
02:12:35,761 --> 02:12:37,540
that I love to do.
And been in pain.

3220
02:12:37,640 --> 02:12:39,320
Injured.
How long have you been injured?

3221
02:12:39,321 --> 02:12:40,154
For many years.
It's been since junior year I started 

3222
02:12:42,681 --> 02:12:45,140
having back problems from football and 
yeah.

3223
02:12:45,160 --> 02:12:47,100
So ball on and off.
Yeah.

3224
02:12:47,210 --> 02:12:48,380
Fucking football.
Fuck.

3225
02:12:48,381 --> 02:12:50,540
So what apple says all the time,
all the time.

3226
02:12:50,541 --> 02:12:54,010
That damn foosball.
And so I've,

3227
02:12:54,160 --> 02:12:54,993
I've dealt it but progressive.
It was the henry is fight was the fight 

3228
02:12:58,611 --> 02:12:59,444
that I almost pulled out of that fight 
was the first five report besides 

3229
02:13:01,431 --> 02:13:03,440
obviously tj had to postpone it.

3230
02:13:03,990 --> 02:13:05,390
Um,
I couldn't walk,

3231
02:13:05,391 --> 02:13:06,224
but sean shelby a gathered window maddix
and our story and that he wanted to 

3232
02:13:10,911 --> 02:13:11,744
walk,
so I just told them and my back was 

3233
02:13:14,150 --> 02:13:15,930
really bad.
Then I'm,

3234
02:13:16,240 --> 02:13:17,690
so that's when it really started to come
on.

3235
02:13:17,691 --> 02:13:21,020
And then I didn't fight for after the 
henry fight and flight for nine months,

3236
02:13:21,021 --> 02:13:24,650
10 months.
And then I got the usi kept booking me.

3237
02:13:24,651 --> 02:13:27,230
I fought augusta mendez was supposed to 
fight,

3238
02:13:27,231 --> 02:13:30,050
um,
other brazilian linacre.

3239
02:13:30,140 --> 02:13:30,973
He got sick the week of the fight 
replacement and then fight hand in 

3240
02:13:33,780 --> 02:13:36,120
almeda and then it was ms dot 
[inaudible].

3241
02:13:36,130 --> 02:13:38,310
Then it was crew.
So I didn't have time to be like really?

3242
02:13:38,460 --> 02:13:39,293
I just dealt with the pain,
like there was times where I would take 

3243
02:13:40,951 --> 02:13:41,784
two weeks off of like really training,
doing anything or it would switch side 

3244
02:13:45,430 --> 02:13:48,060
and my left side or my right side.
So I always go south.

3245
02:13:48,060 --> 02:13:51,260
Paul until that side started messing up.
I switched back to orthodox.

3246
02:13:51,280 --> 02:13:52,113
Like it was a lot of like sometimes 
working around working around it 

3247
02:13:55,610 --> 02:13:56,443
[inaudible] I had to because I get my 
money right for that regina king 

3248
02:13:58,770 --> 02:14:00,090
procedure.
And how did that go?

3249
02:14:00,540 --> 02:14:01,050
You know,
what,

3250
02:14:01,050 --> 02:14:04,170
it felt good.
I feLt like It took the,

3251
02:14:04,340 --> 02:14:05,173
you know,
inflammation inflammation away so it 

3252
02:14:07,350 --> 02:14:09,340
stopped like locking up and sitting the 
shop,

3253
02:14:09,370 --> 02:14:10,650
you know,
the shocks down my leg.

3254
02:14:11,080 --> 02:14:12,600
Um,
but still I was,

3255
02:14:12,660 --> 02:14:15,710
I've been doing rehab since and I've 
been doing rehab one day,

3256
02:14:15,730 --> 02:14:17,910
wednesday and friday and obviously on 
tuesday,

3257
02:14:17,911 --> 02:14:18,744
thursday do lifting.
So I've been doing rehab and getting to 

3258
02:14:21,331 --> 02:14:23,490
because I feel like a better athlete,
I'm moving more.

3259
02:14:23,730 --> 02:14:26,280
But still it's like from being 
constantly wrestling,

3260
02:14:26,281 --> 02:14:27,450
sansar,
boxing stance,

3261
02:14:27,451 --> 02:14:28,284
being like that now I really pride 
myself open and it's the muscles around 

3262
02:14:31,381 --> 02:14:32,660
it are still,
you know,

3263
02:14:32,670 --> 02:14:34,800
I just had a little scare a couple weeks
ago.

3264
02:14:34,860 --> 02:14:36,210
We're good,
you know,

3265
02:14:36,211 --> 02:14:38,700
we're moving on from that.
I feel way better.

3266
02:14:38,701 --> 02:14:40,650
My back backfields way stronger.
Um,

3267
02:14:40,920 --> 02:14:44,040
I wasn't aBle to fight July 8th,
like there's no way.

3268
02:14:44,340 --> 02:14:46,660
Uh,
we try to get optimistic about it.

3269
02:14:46,700 --> 02:14:50,700
Going to Germany and thinking that was 
going to heal miracle miracle,

3270
02:14:50,701 --> 02:14:51,534
miracle shots.
And maybe would have been if you took 

3271
02:14:54,571 --> 02:14:57,750
more time off or time off thing.
It's like you're a pro athlete,

3272
02:14:57,960 --> 02:14:58,793
so like you're not just having these 
procedures and then taking a long time 

3273
02:15:02,761 --> 02:15:03,594
to recover,
you're having these procedures and then 

3274
02:15:04,501 --> 02:15:06,930
trying to get back to training and 
pretty quick literally like,

3275
02:15:07,020 --> 02:15:07,853
you know,
I had that fight so it was literally 

3276
02:15:08,461 --> 02:15:10,560
seven weeks out from when I had the 
first stem.

3277
02:15:10,561 --> 02:15:12,670
So,
and then I take a month off,

3278
02:15:12,840 --> 02:15:17,340
take four weeks off and then two weeks 
of trying to solve leaves me with a week

3279
02:15:17,341 --> 02:15:19,500
and a half to train for my title fight.

3280
02:15:19,500 --> 02:15:23,460
Like you guys understand that it's 
insane and that doesn't even make sense.

3281
02:15:23,790 --> 02:15:26,430
So you are a October 7th is the fight,
right?

3282
02:15:27,390 --> 02:15:28,890
November fourth,
November 4th.

3283
02:15:30,370 --> 02:15:31,650
Madison square.
Oh,

3284
02:15:31,651 --> 02:15:33,240
that's right.
why the fuck that?

3285
02:15:33,241 --> 02:15:34,021
I think.
Okay.

3286
02:15:34,021 --> 02:15:36,510
That makes that stuff.
That makes it hard,

3287
02:15:36,700 --> 02:15:37,533
I guess.
I mean I got hit by a couple of news 

3288
02:15:38,521 --> 02:15:39,750
outlets.
I was fighting october.

3289
02:15:39,751 --> 02:15:40,680
I'm like,
yeah,

3290
02:15:40,681 --> 02:15:43,680
that's the vegas vegas card.
Who's on that card?

3291
02:15:44,920 --> 02:15:48,210
Who is Kevin Lee?
I think that sort of ferguson.

3292
02:15:48,211 --> 02:15:50,640
Kevin lee for the interim.
One hundred 55 pound title.

3293
02:15:50,670 --> 02:15:51,503
Yeah.
That whole interim thing is so crazy 

3294
02:15:52,741 --> 02:15:53,574
right?
They Just sort of randomly decide when 

3295
02:15:54,901 --> 02:15:56,880
they're going to have that title,
how they do that.

3296
02:15:57,060 --> 02:16:00,360
I remember dominick cruz had it for a 
long time and they let him keep it for a

3297
02:16:00,361 --> 02:16:01,980
long time and there's some guys they 
just like,

3298
02:16:01,981 --> 02:16:02,814
all right,
you're done.

3299
02:16:03,750 --> 02:16:05,790
That's what I was with the whole thing 
that I said,

3300
02:16:05,791 --> 02:16:06,624
I'm not rushing back.
If you guys want to make an interim 

3301
02:16:07,831 --> 02:16:09,720
title or take the title from me,
that's fine.

3302
02:16:09,780 --> 02:16:11,680
I'm 25 years.
I'm going to.

3303
02:16:12,050 --> 02:16:14,380
I'm going to get the title back.
I got it here.

3304
02:16:14,400 --> 02:16:16,290
I'm going to get it back if that's where
it happened.

3305
02:16:16,580 --> 02:16:17,850
So I didn't want anyone to sit,
you know,

3306
02:16:17,851 --> 02:16:20,670
tj wanted to go down fighting dj because
that was my thing.

3307
02:16:20,671 --> 02:16:22,710
I texted john and dan [inaudible] I can 
make 25.

3308
02:16:22,740 --> 02:16:23,573
That was my whole game plan was to fight
tj July 8th and I got her pull out and 

3309
02:16:29,321 --> 02:16:30,010
it was going to fight

3310
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:31,950
dj a massive.
So regarding.

3311
02:16:31,960 --> 02:16:34,460
So I was always in my mind was going to 
fight in november,

3312
02:16:34,480 --> 02:16:36,760
massive square garden.
It just a different opponent.

3313
02:16:37,270 --> 02:16:38,103
Well somebody's gotta fight dj.
I was kinda bummed out that demetrius 

3314
02:16:42,490 --> 02:16:43,323
decided not to fight tj our video.
I'd never even knew that was an option 

3315
02:16:47,260 --> 02:16:48,850
just to be like,
I'm not going to fight.

3316
02:16:49,210 --> 02:16:50,560
Well,
he said,

3317
02:16:50,620 --> 02:16:51,453
and I guess his mindset is that he's one
fight away from breaking the record of 

3318
02:16:56,681 --> 02:17:01,240
the most title defenses ever.
And if tj being down,

3319
02:17:01,360 --> 02:17:03,970
being able to beat up anyone in the 
world and your weight.

3320
02:17:04,020 --> 02:17:04,853
Yes.
Which is the important thing to think 

3321
02:17:06,251 --> 02:17:07,570
about there.
Yes it is,

3322
02:17:07,870 --> 02:17:11,680
but if he lost a tj and tj didn't make 
the weight,

3323
02:17:11,681 --> 02:17:14,550
it would fuck them up.
Like if tj decided not to,

3324
02:17:14,650 --> 02:17:16,600
if he couldn't make the weight.
It's a lot of ifs.

3325
02:17:16,600 --> 02:17:17,433
There's a lot of assets a lot.
So he wanted tj to fight one time I 

3326
02:17:21,240 --> 02:17:25,180
would make sure you can make the and 
then fight them.

3327
02:17:25,690 --> 02:17:28,510
I guess it makes sense,
but the other thought processes your,

3328
02:17:28,511 --> 02:17:30,580
the pound for pound best fighter on the 
planet.

3329
02:17:30,820 --> 02:17:31,653
You should be fighting the best fight 
that you can get and that's a really 

3330
02:17:34,301 --> 02:17:35,134
good fight.
It's like no one's floyd didn't make 

3331
02:17:36,971 --> 02:17:38,500
sure economy gregory could make the 
weight.

3332
02:17:38,860 --> 02:17:41,450
No,
they just booked the fight and the light

3333
02:17:41,470 --> 02:17:42,303
on them as a professional,
and jon jones wouldn't fight shale 

3334
02:17:44,111 --> 02:17:46,420
though.
That's because he hated shale though.

3335
02:17:46,480 --> 02:17:47,800
That was part of part of it.
It was like,

3336
02:17:47,801 --> 02:17:48,634
fuck this guy.
This guy might have a possibility of 

3337
02:17:50,471 --> 02:17:51,700
beating me.
He goes,

3338
02:17:51,701 --> 02:17:52,150
no,
I'll,

3339
02:17:52,150 --> 02:17:54,340
I'll do this through a real camp.
And he goes,

3340
02:17:54,341 --> 02:17:56,470
I'm not going to come in here and take 
this on short notice.

3341
02:17:57,070 --> 02:17:57,903
I don't know man.
I mean he took the osp fight on short 

3342
02:17:59,561 --> 02:18:01,440
notice and it wasn't his best fight.
You know,

3343
02:18:01,450 --> 02:18:02,283
he sort of prides himself on having a 
long game plan and that's his mentality 

3344
02:18:05,920 --> 02:18:06,753
to man,
this whole thing is so depressing with 

3345
02:18:08,830 --> 02:18:09,663
john.
Apparently we're gonna find out soon 

3346
02:18:13,090 --> 02:18:14,950
what's going to happen with the b 
sample,

3347
02:18:15,320 --> 02:18:16,153
you know,
but if the b sample test positive as 

3348
02:18:17,321 --> 02:18:18,430
well,
he's kind of doomed.

3349
02:18:18,760 --> 02:18:22,990
This is doing what,
what would be three or four years,

3350
02:18:23,020 --> 02:18:24,940
four years.
Let that belief.

3351
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,320
I mean obviously I'm not the fucking 
athletic commissioner.

3352
02:18:27,330 --> 02:18:32,050
You saw it or whoever calls it out,
but I think the first one was what?

3353
02:18:32,320 --> 02:18:35,310
Well,
the first one was an out of competent.

3354
02:18:35,590 --> 02:18:36,423
No,
the first one was a tainted supplement 

3355
02:18:38,891 --> 02:18:40,120
and they gave him a year.
Right?

3356
02:18:40,210 --> 02:18:42,730
Didn't it give me a year for the dick 
pills.

3357
02:18:43,240 --> 02:18:44,720
So was it really dick pills?

3358
02:18:44,720 --> 02:18:49,720
So it was the other test to the pills 
blockers.

3359
02:18:50,200 --> 02:18:53,790
They put those in these estrogen.
In these messages.

3360
02:18:53,820 --> 02:18:55,800
Gas station dick pills.
Yeah,

3361
02:18:55,810 --> 02:18:58,330
because they make you excited.
They block your estrogen,

3362
02:18:58,450 --> 02:19:00,220
fill you up with.
I mean look,

3363
02:19:00,250 --> 02:19:01,083
they could put whatever the fuck they 
want in those things is trying to get 

3364
02:19:02,741 --> 02:19:03,574
your dick hard.
Not.

3365
02:19:03,670 --> 02:19:04,503
They're not thInking that a world class 
world champion professional athletes 

3366
02:19:08,050 --> 02:19:13,050
taken me of 11 gets he's a maniac.
But don't you think though,

3367
02:19:13,931 --> 02:19:16,780
I mean this is what I've always said,
that world class fighters,

3368
02:19:16,781 --> 02:19:17,614
like professional fighters are not like 
any other athlete because they're 

3369
02:19:19,421 --> 02:19:20,254
fucking reckless.
They're wild motherfuckers like cowboy 

3370
02:19:22,900 --> 02:19:24,520
like you.
Like a lot of guys,

3371
02:19:24,880 --> 02:19:28,640
they are impulsive,
reckless risk taking people.

3372
02:19:28,790 --> 02:19:29,390
Oh,
you know,

3373
02:19:29,390 --> 02:19:30,350
I don't know.
I mean,

3374
02:19:30,351 --> 02:19:35,351
I guess I guess disciplined for sure.
I mean a professional cali kid,

3375
02:19:35,961 --> 02:19:37,030
you know,
you're,

3376
02:19:37,130 --> 02:19:38,300
you're definitely different.

3377
02:19:38,420 --> 02:19:40,400
But there's a lot of different guys in 
the sport,

3378
02:19:40,430 --> 02:19:41,263
you know,
that have,

3379
02:19:41,360 --> 02:19:43,040
you know,
different personalities,

3380
02:19:43,520 --> 02:19:47,030
but a lot of fighters,
it's a big percentage that are wild.

3381
02:19:47,510 --> 02:19:48,343
And john's fucking wild.
Like if you want to get a wild 

3382
02:19:50,961 --> 02:19:51,794
motherfucker like john who opens up his 
fight at 23 years old fighting shogun 

3383
02:19:55,941 --> 02:19:59,190
for the world title with a flying knee 
against shogun.

3384
02:19:59,191 --> 02:20:00,470
I mean that's how I opened the fight.
That's,

3385
02:20:00,640 --> 02:20:03,370
that's a wild impulsive dude.
He just go,

3386
02:20:03,380 --> 02:20:05,210
feels it and goes with it.
Flow state.

3387
02:20:05,211 --> 02:20:07,460
Yeah.
And feels like pop them gas station dick

3388
02:20:07,461 --> 02:20:08,294
pills,
just like,

3389
02:20:08,570 --> 02:20:11,600
let's just do these red lining that all 
the time.

3390
02:20:12,150 --> 02:20:14,370
There's no like,
well,

3391
02:20:14,830 --> 02:20:17,050
I mean he had all the excuses,
you know,

3392
02:20:17,051 --> 02:20:19,270
the cocaine was just partying.
The dick pills.

3393
02:20:19,271 --> 02:20:20,104
That's more of the same.
now this one though is a different 

3394
02:20:21,911 --> 02:20:23,170
thing.
This is an actual.

3395
02:20:24,010 --> 02:20:26,200
He's not saying anything.
No one's saying no,

3396
02:20:26,290 --> 02:20:28,690
no official statement.
Talk to my lawyer.

3397
02:20:29,170 --> 02:20:30,003
Yeah.
I mean they're saying they didn't do 

3398
02:20:30,911 --> 02:20:31,860
anything,
you know,

3399
02:20:31,870 --> 02:20:32,703
that would Be the most fucked up thing 
in the world if somebody slipped some 

3400
02:20:34,121 --> 02:20:35,740
shit into your water.
You know,

3401
02:20:35,770 --> 02:20:36,603
just to get you to test positive,
but you got to watch everything you 

3402
02:20:38,711 --> 02:20:39,730
fucking eat.
I mean,

3403
02:20:39,780 --> 02:20:40,613
you always have to think.
People definitely do double cross 

3404
02:20:42,311 --> 02:20:44,050
people.
Definitely in this world,

3405
02:20:44,320 --> 02:20:48,340
there's somebody who would absolutely 
put something tainted in your food.

3406
02:20:48,520 --> 02:20:49,780
All they have to do is sprinkle a little
bit,

3407
02:20:49,781 --> 02:20:53,170
a little bit of it in a dish of food.
You wouldn't even notice it.

3408
02:20:53,560 --> 02:20:54,970
I made you really think that's what 
happened.

3409
02:20:55,120 --> 02:20:56,830
I don't think anything.
I don't know anything.

3410
02:20:56,930 --> 02:20:58,880
I wonder.
I mean that's true though.

3411
02:20:58,970 --> 02:21:00,980
I mean they're so fucking evil people 
out there.

3412
02:21:01,190 --> 02:21:05,090
That's one thing I've learned is getting
older is like just being a nice guy.

3413
02:21:05,091 --> 02:21:05,924
You assume everyone's nice and good and 
it's like there's some creepy negative 

3414
02:21:10,760 --> 02:21:11,340
people out there

3415
02:21:11,340 --> 02:21:11,690
there.
Man.

3416
02:21:11,690 --> 02:21:13,920
It's beautiful when you find nice people
because of that though,

3417
02:21:14,220 --> 02:21:15,053
it balances it out.
So when you know people that you can 

3418
02:21:17,131 --> 02:21:19,500
trust that really are your brother,
that's like,

3419
02:21:19,501 --> 02:21:21,900
that makes it all the more it'll give.
Everybody was cool.

3420
02:21:21,901 --> 02:21:24,450
You wouldn't necessarily appreciate cool
people as much.

3421
02:21:25,230 --> 02:21:26,070
Absolutely.
Yeah.

3422
02:21:26,071 --> 02:21:26,790
I mean that'd be good

3423
02:21:26,790 --> 02:21:31,320
everywhere.
Whereas all the dishes get mad.

3424
02:21:31,340 --> 02:21:34,760
I need an enemy.
That is.

3425
02:21:35,250 --> 02:21:37,170
Have you ever fought somebody that you 
really liked?

3426
02:21:37,770 --> 02:21:40,440
I thought a bunch of guys.
Who'd you fight that you really liked?

3427
02:21:40,470 --> 02:21:42,180
Your.
I liked?

3428
02:21:42,181 --> 02:21:43,700
Uh,
charlie valencia.

3429
02:21:43,710 --> 02:21:46,590
Brian bowls.
I like scotty jorgensen.

3430
02:21:46,591 --> 02:21:49,820
I liked eddie wineland.
You're friends with those guys.

3431
02:21:49,890 --> 02:21:53,680
Michael mcdonald.
I was friends with all this guy's weird,

3432
02:21:53,700 --> 02:21:54,533
right?
I could say probably one who ms dot 

3433
02:21:56,401 --> 02:21:58,230
gawky just because he didn't speak 
english,

3434
02:21:58,720 --> 02:22:01,200
but honestly I was like,
man,

3435
02:22:01,201 --> 02:22:03,120
he's like,
but cody from the get go.

3436
02:22:03,121 --> 02:22:03,631
He goes,
hey man,

3437
02:22:03,631 --> 02:22:05,190
I know you're cool to your opponents.
Everything.

3438
02:22:05,191 --> 02:22:07,290
BUt I like,
I like intensity.

3439
02:22:07,310 --> 02:22:08,143
I like if I,
like people say that he's got a temper 

3440
02:22:10,081 --> 02:22:11,600
everything and he's like,
yeah,

3441
02:22:11,601 --> 02:22:13,110
it's,
he's fighting this guy.

3442
02:22:13,111 --> 02:22:15,240
He's getting that mentality.
That's part of what he liked.

3443
02:22:15,630 --> 02:22:18,270
My thing is I will either you whip your 
ass,

3444
02:22:18,360 --> 02:22:19,193
whip my ass.
I'm always going To show you respect 

3445
02:22:20,041 --> 02:22:20,701
after like,
hey,

3446
02:22:20,701 --> 02:22:21,534
you know,
it's good.

3447
02:22:21,900 --> 02:22:26,160
I remembered that when I got signed,
I fought marcus image and

3448
02:22:26,160 --> 02:22:28,080
I don't like shaking my opponent's hand 
before the fight.

3449
02:22:28,081 --> 02:22:30,680
I never liked that.
I never liked glove touching any of that

3450
02:22:30,690 --> 02:22:31,523
in markets.
We,

3451
02:22:31,670 --> 02:22:33,120
I saw him a couple times in the hotel.
He's like,

3452
02:22:33,121 --> 02:22:33,954
what's up man?
Like,

3453
02:22:34,160 --> 02:22:35,340
I got it.
Cool man.

3454
02:22:36,160 --> 02:22:38,280
Good to see you saturday.
You know what I mean?

3455
02:22:38,750 --> 02:22:40,410
And I taught them before weigh ins.
I was like,

3456
02:22:40,411 --> 02:22:40,741
hey,
you know,

3457
02:22:40,741 --> 02:22:41,640
go on stage.
Like,

3458
02:22:41,720 --> 02:22:42,553
hey,
I don't want to shake your hand out 

3459
02:22:42,901 --> 02:22:43,920
there.
Don't make me look like a dick.

3460
02:22:43,921 --> 02:22:45,030
Like if I go to shit,
you know,

3461
02:22:45,650 --> 02:22:46,770
it's cool.
It's cool.

3462
02:22:46,771 --> 02:22:47,604
Yeah,
right on w w I said I got respect for 

3463
02:22:48,931 --> 02:22:49,764
you.
I promise show and I'm like walking 

3464
02:22:51,241 --> 02:22:52,730
away.
I'm like all right.

3465
02:22:52,740 --> 02:22:55,640
Any like shook his hand out there.
And I was like in my mind like it was.

3466
02:22:55,650 --> 02:22:56,850
Oh.
So I shook it again.

3467
02:22:57,050 --> 02:23:00,640
And recalling back to buckle's was like,
he got me again with the handshake.

3468
02:23:01,500 --> 02:23:06,270
I didn't even realize exactly.
It puts us on to come up and be like,

3469
02:23:06,271 --> 02:23:07,081
hey,
I don't want to shake your hand,

3470
02:23:07,081 --> 02:23:07,914
let's fight.
But how about the throat bridge against 

3471
02:23:09,860 --> 02:23:14,860
tourists and against no love man,
because he wears that thing where that's

3472
02:23:16,651 --> 02:23:19,010
our goal.
So what are you doing?

3473
02:23:19,050 --> 02:23:20,980
You're the video game.
The,

3474
02:23:20,981 --> 02:23:23,370
um,
the post fight press conference.

3475
02:23:23,430 --> 02:23:24,263
Uh,
I had a lot of respect for dominick 

3476
02:23:25,381 --> 02:23:26,460
cruz.
The way you handled that.

3477
02:23:26,880 --> 02:23:28,410
He just,
he didn't know excuses,

3478
02:23:28,420 --> 02:23:30,870
like took it like a man.
So he was a Better man.

3479
02:23:30,871 --> 02:23:32,610
He beat me.
I got no excuses.

3480
02:23:32,611 --> 02:23:34,550
there's nothing I could say.
Yeah,

3481
02:23:35,850 --> 02:23:36,683
for sure.
No,

3482
02:23:36,720 --> 02:23:39,200
definitely we've had our differences and
still might not.

3483
02:23:39,290 --> 02:23:41,190
He still has me blocked on instagram and
twitter,

3484
02:23:41,210 --> 02:23:42,043
but man,
top sheet on my wife's a photo and then 

3485
02:23:46,801 --> 02:23:47,760
blocked me.
I'm like,

3486
02:23:47,761 --> 02:23:52,761
this motherfucker that shit up.

3487
02:23:53,490 --> 02:23:54,420
I'm like,
you blocked me.

3488
02:23:54,520 --> 02:23:59,370
Like trying to be cool to do an 
interview in it.

3489
02:23:59,371 --> 02:24:01,990
Don was trying to needle cody cody's 
like this.

3490
02:24:02,100 --> 02:24:04,800
I didn't even know what was going on,
what was happening.

3491
02:24:04,801 --> 02:24:07,320
I was doing the fox for the ultimate 
fighter.

3492
02:24:07,321 --> 02:24:10,180
It was obviously karen.
Brian asked about me grabbing teacher by

3493
02:24:10,181 --> 02:24:11,100
his throat.
Like,

3494
02:24:11,101 --> 02:24:11,934
yeah,
he goes anD me and dominic got into a 

3495
02:24:14,040 --> 02:24:16,140
altercation at wayne's at two.
OH seven.

3496
02:24:16,530 --> 02:24:18,200
I come out.
I'm just waiting.

3497
02:24:18,210 --> 02:24:20,940
I had my hands full with all the 
paperwork bullshit they give us.

3498
02:24:20,941 --> 02:24:23,250
And george gave me all these waters and 
refuel stuff,

3499
02:24:23,760 --> 02:24:26,940
so I come out of the door and I crossed 
paths with dava quite didn't know,

3500
02:24:27,270 --> 02:24:29,450
didn't even register with him,
but I might prefer you.

3501
02:24:29,460 --> 02:24:33,390
I catch something and I kinD of like 
turned back around and He was like,

3502
02:24:33,391 --> 02:24:36,470
had these sunglasses on,
like these big chicken sunglasses.

3503
02:24:36,480 --> 02:24:37,313
Yeah.
Split up news like kicked out of you 

3504
02:24:39,260 --> 02:24:41,160
skinny little motherfucker.
And I was like,

3505
02:24:41,280 --> 02:24:41,731
oh.
I was like,

3506
02:24:41,731 --> 02:24:42,750
dude,
we're fighting tomorrow man.

3507
02:24:42,751 --> 02:24:43,740
I was like,
so good.

3508
02:24:43,741 --> 02:24:44,850
I was just laughing,
like really?

3509
02:24:44,851 --> 02:24:45,684
Like he wants to do it now.
The first time we saw each other a day 

3510
02:24:48,721 --> 02:24:50,930
before we were in this split room,
this,

3511
02:24:51,010 --> 02:24:53,400
this much or we're talking shit to each 
other on a camera.

3512
02:24:53,410 --> 02:24:54,243
I'm like,
well we can't do like sit down and 

3513
02:24:55,201 --> 02:24:58,860
obviously like that he has Jeremy 
Stevens in there and I'm like man he got

3514
02:24:58,870 --> 02:25:00,570
in.
Steve's a good little boy,

3515
02:25:00,571 --> 02:25:01,404
like talking,
like just riding off of dom's hype or 

3516
02:25:03,901 --> 02:25:04,734
off is off don.
LIke he brought in a self proclaimed 

3517
02:25:07,440 --> 02:25:08,273
savage and Jeremy Stevens like to 
counterbalance that I was portraying to 

3518
02:25:11,371 --> 02:25:12,810
be a savage.
That's what he kept saying.

3519
02:25:12,811 --> 02:25:14,070
I'm like,
like I was like,

3520
02:25:14,250 --> 02:25:15,060
I'll come over back.

3521
02:25:15,060 --> 02:25:16,740
Both of you guys right now,
took my earpiece off.

3522
02:25:17,100 --> 02:25:20,840
I ran through the securIty and then he 
was saying I was throwing shit.

3523
02:25:20,890 --> 02:25:22,920
It just the whole buildup.
So we finally saw each.

3524
02:25:23,950 --> 02:25:24,501
I was like,
man,

3525
02:25:24,501 --> 02:25:26,080
it was,
I got beat your ass tomorrow.

3526
02:25:26,081 --> 02:25:29,410
Like walk it off like I to just hide it.
and I see Jeremy Stevens,

3527
02:25:29,480 --> 02:25:31,220
ray,
he's all puffed up.

3528
02:25:31,221 --> 02:25:33,310
He's like,
you're too small little dude.

3529
02:25:33,311 --> 02:25:34,750
He's like,
give me one of your teammates.

3530
02:25:34,950 --> 02:25:35,783
And I was like,
I dropped all my shit and get ready to 

3531
02:25:37,361 --> 02:25:37,830
hit.
I'm like,

3532
02:25:37,830 --> 02:25:38,970
man,
I'll leave.

3533
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,410
My manager comes out of nowhere,
swoops jeremy up.

3534
02:25:41,740 --> 02:25:44,140
But he grabbed me like he like scratched
my neck,

3535
02:25:44,150 --> 02:25:47,130
had a big scratch on it from his nails a
little bit now.

3536
02:25:47,620 --> 02:25:50,040
And like,
so it was that.

3537
02:25:50,050 --> 02:25:50,883
And then,
uh,

3538
02:25:51,310 --> 02:25:54,100
that whole car.
So he gets on skype or not skype.

3539
02:25:54,370 --> 02:25:58,600
Fox sports is about to do an interview 
Interview about the situation of tough.

3540
02:25:58,601 --> 02:26:00,310
Karen brian asked that and he goes,
he said,

3541
02:26:00,311 --> 02:26:01,144
come.
He's like,

3542
02:26:01,540 --> 02:26:02,590
hey,
just a little dick.

3543
02:26:02,790 --> 02:26:03,460
You know,
he just,

3544
02:26:03,460 --> 02:26:04,061
you know,
whatever,

3545
02:26:04,061 --> 02:26:06,100
you can respect him for what he did and 
he,

3546
02:26:06,120 --> 02:26:08,140
he,
because he knows that I always said that

3547
02:26:08,141 --> 02:26:11,410
he knew what he had to do in that media 
for people not to hate him.

3548
02:26:11,680 --> 02:26:14,110
You know,
look how connor and raley sometimes they

3549
02:26:14,111 --> 02:26:16,020
will change a little bit after he lost 
he,

3550
02:26:16,070 --> 02:26:18,550
he took us home a pine,
a respect them for that.

3551
02:26:18,790 --> 02:26:23,190
But I knew deep down that wasn't turmoil
in their exact.

3552
02:26:23,230 --> 02:26:25,960
It has to be a dance all over his ass.
You know what I mean?

3553
02:26:25,961 --> 02:26:27,460
He's a great fighter.
I embarrassed him,

3554
02:26:27,690 --> 02:26:30,070
you know,
saturDay really go.

3555
02:26:31,870 --> 02:26:33,470
Oh.
So I come on and I'm split.

3556
02:26:33,500 --> 02:26:33,950
Coolest.
Cool.

3557
02:26:33,950 --> 02:26:34,751
I respect Him.
Like,

3558
02:26:34,751 --> 02:26:35,680
hey,
hat's off.

3559
02:26:35,681 --> 02:26:36,790
Get a tough,
tough dude.

3560
02:26:36,830 --> 02:26:37,750
We talked after.
I was like,

3561
02:26:37,751 --> 02:26:38,351
yeah,
that guy's tough.

3562
02:26:38,351 --> 02:26:42,840
Like I'll been pictured in this and 
would come on and say hey,

3563
02:26:42,850 --> 02:26:44,230
you're getting joined with dominic.
And I'm like,

3564
02:26:44,260 --> 02:26:46,060
oh cool.
Like that's cool.

3565
02:26:46,110 --> 02:26:46,943
Like,
like it has to be brief that we're 

3566
02:26:48,611 --> 02:26:49,720
professionals.
Like okay.

3567
02:26:50,050 --> 02:26:51,580
So iT goes on about things like,
yeah.

3568
02:26:51,590 --> 02:26:54,220
Have you ever been choked up at wayans?
And if so,

3569
02:26:54,221 --> 02:26:55,690
what would you do?
And I'm like,

3570
02:26:55,691 --> 02:26:56,980
really thinking about this.
I'm like,

3571
02:26:57,610 --> 02:26:58,091
well,
you know,

3572
02:26:58,091 --> 02:26:58,924
hopefully that will be professional 
enough to keep my composure and know 

3573
02:27:01,121 --> 02:27:02,710
that I'm going to whip this dude's ass 
tomorrow.

3574
02:27:02,830 --> 02:27:03,663
And then he was like,
huh?

3575
02:27:04,060 --> 02:27:05,640
Like just being a smart ass.
And he was like,

3576
02:27:05,650 --> 02:27:05,950
oh,
he'S sick.

3577
02:27:05,950 --> 02:27:07,690
So he didn't mean to tell me you never 
been choked up.

3578
02:27:07,930 --> 02:27:09,610
And that dawned on me,
I was like,

3579
02:27:09,640 --> 02:27:10,473
oh,
are you talking about when you brought 

3580
02:27:11,020 --> 02:27:13,300
your self proclaimed hype man in and 
scratch my,

3581
02:27:13,400 --> 02:27:14,800
my neck with his little bitch now?

3582
02:27:15,250 --> 02:27:16,330
and he's like,
no,

3583
02:27:16,420 --> 02:27:17,081
no.
I was like,

3584
02:27:17,081 --> 02:27:17,881
hey dominic.
I said,

3585
02:27:17,881 --> 02:27:19,270
what happened in the fight?
I said,

3586
02:27:19,271 --> 02:27:21,990
I danced around you and beat your ass 
and made you look like a fool.

3587
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:23,290
I said,
sit behind a desk and shut up.

3588
02:27:23,680 --> 02:27:26,800
And then it was like this that go on 
skype.

3589
02:27:26,801 --> 02:27:29,590
Just as old as a private conversation.
Private conversations goes black screen,

3590
02:27:29,591 --> 02:27:30,490
the producers come on,
we're like,

3591
02:27:30,491 --> 02:27:31,324
we're sorry how dominic was acting like,
I don't mind coming on here and doing 

3592
02:27:35,051 --> 02:27:35,884
this shit,
but I.

3593
02:27:36,520 --> 02:27:37,570
The first thing I said,
hey dominic,

3594
02:27:37,571 --> 02:27:39,160
how are you?
And I was like,

3595
02:27:39,161 --> 02:27:40,420
oh,
just waiting for dominic's and say hi.

3596
02:27:40,421 --> 02:27:41,560
And he started off.
He goes,

3597
02:27:41,561 --> 02:27:42,394
I don't get to say hi to you,
I'm talking to you in a couple of 

3598
02:27:43,201 --> 02:27:44,530
minutes.
and I was like,

3599
02:27:44,550 --> 02:27:45,383
oh god,
what the fuck you guys are probably 

3600
02:27:46,991 --> 02:27:48,850
going to fight again if tom stays in the
game.

3601
02:27:49,270 --> 02:27:53,040
So we had to redo the whole sItuation 
and he just sitting there like,

3602
02:27:53,100 --> 02:27:55,100
you know,
because I was like,

3603
02:27:55,120 --> 02:27:55,990
man,
that's cool.

3604
02:27:56,400 --> 02:27:58,360
So that's why I wanted the rematch with 
them.

3605
02:27:58,361 --> 02:27:59,194
so honestly tj should thank don for not 
taking the rematch and finally getting 

3606
02:28:03,260 --> 02:28:05,410
his shot.
So that's why after the fight.

3607
02:28:05,420 --> 02:28:07,830
So tj tom Doing these days,
you know,

3608
02:28:07,840 --> 02:28:08,673
I know he has plantar fasciitis,
got some serious issues with his feet 

3609
02:28:11,111 --> 02:28:11,944
because he came back real quick after 
the knee surgery anD maybe pushed it a 

3610
02:28:14,621 --> 02:28:16,040
little too hard.
That's a,

3611
02:28:16,060 --> 02:28:16,893
that's a tough one.
I mean tHat's why his feet were all 

3612
02:28:18,580 --> 02:28:20,910
taped up.
He's doing a lot of commentary on.

3613
02:28:21,550 --> 02:28:23,720
Yeah,
I'm probably getting decent manager that

3614
02:28:23,721 --> 02:28:25,520
I talked to his coach.
They're going to try to get,

3615
02:28:25,670 --> 02:28:26,820
you know,
we didn't win,

3616
02:28:27,150 --> 02:28:27,983
it was scheduled,
but he was trying to fight on the same 

3617
02:28:29,841 --> 02:28:31,130
cart or around about.

3618
02:28:31,130 --> 02:28:31,963
So it keeps in the transition.
Who do you think would be a good fight 

3619
02:28:34,611 --> 02:28:36,310
for him to fight for?
Dominic?

3620
02:28:36,470 --> 02:28:38,570
It's a good question.
WIthout a riviera.

3621
02:28:39,250 --> 02:28:40,950
Very good fight.
Very good fight.

3622
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,700
But I think doesn't he?
Doesn't jimmy have a fight?

3623
02:28:45,310 --> 02:28:47,690
He just beat the dude that you knocked 
out.

3624
02:28:48,510 --> 02:28:50,510
Oh,
he alomeda he'd be,

3625
02:28:50,580 --> 02:28:53,180
he'd be out.
Dropped him a couple times.

3626
02:28:53,200 --> 02:28:54,030
That was.
Yeah,

3627
02:28:54,030 --> 02:28:55,800
it was a very good fight.
That's already beat it.

3628
02:28:55,801 --> 02:28:56,634
I made it,
but I feel like he has another fight 

3629
02:28:57,560 --> 02:28:58,730
lined up.
Maybe I'm wrong.

3630
02:28:58,880 --> 02:29:01,500
Maybe it was.
I'm thinking of um,

3631
02:29:01,630 --> 02:29:03,430
you know,
the day Before the fight,

3632
02:29:03,431 --> 02:29:06,560
like hype before the fight is always so 
interesting to see how people react,

3633
02:29:06,561 --> 02:29:07,394
see where their head's at.
Like when connor came out with a heart 

3634
02:29:09,171 --> 02:29:11,600
on against floyd.
What is,

3635
02:29:11,930 --> 02:29:12,763
what is he doing?
Is he fucking wearing a rubber band 

3636
02:29:14,511 --> 02:29:16,430
around his ticket balls just to get it 
hard?

3637
02:29:16,430 --> 02:29:19,400
Or is he playing with himself before he 
gets out there?

3638
02:29:19,401 --> 02:29:23,270
a couple shakes before he gets on his 
fucking dick was half hard,

3639
02:29:23,271 --> 02:29:28,271
but he's standing there hard and that's 
just what it looks like when it's limp,

3640
02:29:28,880 --> 02:29:29,713
but it literally looked like it was half
hard when he's standing there at the 

3641
02:29:31,900 --> 02:29:34,870
wind.
Like a siren.

3642
02:29:35,300 --> 02:29:37,640
The hill.
I've seen a couple of the guys,

3643
02:29:37,641 --> 02:29:42,110
I think mcgill dixit way and a couple 
other guys that had that same thing.

3644
02:29:42,111 --> 02:29:42,944
I think it's like an involuntary thing 
that happens when you're like hungry or 

3645
02:29:45,921 --> 02:29:46,754
something.
I dunno.

3646
02:29:47,270 --> 02:29:49,610
I'll tell you what.
Get survival.

3647
02:29:49,700 --> 02:29:50,533
We have to go.
We haD to get real creative on the 

3648
02:29:51,981 --> 02:29:52,814
physical anthropology of why you get a 
hard out when you're about to get into 

3649
02:29:56,030 --> 02:29:56,863
confrontation.
Maybe you're going to fight over a 

3650
02:29:58,131 --> 02:29:58,964
female out the nature and I can maybe.
It was just such a weird problem when 

3651
02:30:02,890 --> 02:30:03,200
stinks.

3652
02:30:03,200 --> 02:30:04,033
Confrontation to connor screaming,
yelling at him or for just standing 

3653
02:30:06,651 --> 02:30:09,170
there literally like not a worry in the 
world.

3654
02:30:09,200 --> 02:30:11,220
It was interesting how floyd handled it.
Yeah.

3655
02:30:11,680 --> 02:30:14,510
He didn't have a worry in the world.
We're seeing that.

3656
02:30:14,511 --> 02:30:19,190
I see composed because you know,
you're so composed 50 and oh man,

3657
02:30:19,280 --> 02:30:20,040
15.
Oh,

3658
02:30:20,040 --> 02:30:20,873
you know,
I'd said that he was the only guy that 

3659
02:30:21,951 --> 02:30:22,784
ever reached that and break that record,
but apparently there was some other guy 

3660
02:30:25,190 --> 02:30:30,190
that had fought and I'm like a really 
light weight that made 51 zero.

3661
02:30:30,710 --> 02:30:31,311
Oh really?
Yeah.

3662
02:30:31,311 --> 02:30:32,144
That I didn't even know.
I thought they were talking about rocky 

3663
02:30:35,160 --> 02:30:35,993
marciano.
I was taught that that was the record 

3664
02:30:37,260 --> 02:30:38,093
for the child is it?
Wasn't he like up there before he got 

3665
02:30:40,430 --> 02:30:41,630
defeated too?
Good question.

3666
02:30:41,631 --> 02:30:45,590
But he didn't retire with question one 
was like six years.

3667
02:30:45,830 --> 02:30:47,300
RicArdo lopez?
Yeah.

3668
02:30:47,301 --> 02:30:50,390
He was a.
What wait was.

3669
02:30:50,391 --> 02:30:54,260
He doesn't say light flyweight yeah.
What?

3670
02:30:54,270 --> 02:30:55,940
What is that?
What is light flyweight?

3671
02:30:56,030 --> 02:30:58,490
Minimum waiting.
Jesus minimum.

3672
02:30:58,491 --> 02:31:00,080
Wait,
what the fuck is minimum way.

3673
02:31:00,290 --> 02:31:02,780
But ricardo lopez a.
Maybe he,

3674
02:31:02,840 --> 02:31:05,840
I believe he retired at 51 and.
Oh.

3675
02:31:05,920 --> 02:31:08,750
Oh,
he retired somewhere around that range.

3676
02:31:09,350 --> 02:31:11,910
Does it say one girl?
Yeah.

3677
02:31:11,930 --> 02:31:13,130
Oh,
we had to draw 50.

3678
02:31:13,131 --> 02:31:15,610
One wins,
zero losses and one draw.

3679
02:31:16,300 --> 02:31:18,480
The one draws the.
It's so funny.

3680
02:31:18,620 --> 02:31:20,100
People about that shit.
It's so

3681
02:31:20,100 --> 02:31:20,933
weird.
That's one thing about mma fighters as 

3682
02:31:23,311 --> 02:31:27,300
opposed to boxers.
Boxer who was always undefeated record.

3683
02:31:27,480 --> 02:31:29,820
That was like,
that's such a big selling point in the.

3684
02:31:29,821 --> 02:31:30,654
In the.

3685
02:31:31,960 --> 02:31:32,793
Yeah,
anD I guess it makes sense though 

3686
02:31:33,401 --> 02:31:36,940
because I mean you're trying to make a 
case that nolan could,

3687
02:31:37,160 --> 02:31:37,993
you know,
there's something intriguing about 

3688
02:31:38,741 --> 02:31:41,550
somebody that can,
that no one could ever beat this person,

3689
02:31:41,610 --> 02:31:44,040
but the difference between mma and 
boxing and mma,

3690
02:31:44,041 --> 02:31:44,874
you're tested way more on the way up to 
the title and you're fighting world 

3691
02:31:47,701 --> 02:31:50,850
class fighters pretty quickly soon as 
you start getting to zero.

3692
02:31:50,910 --> 02:31:54,180
Whereas in boxing you're taking care of 
your record,

3693
02:31:54,181 --> 02:31:58,020
gets pad and you're slowly worked up to 
a world class fighter.

3694
02:31:58,021 --> 02:31:58,890
If you have a good manager,

3695
02:31:58,940 --> 02:32:02,960
maybe 15 to 20 fights and you're trying 
to maybe start fighting some.

3696
02:32:03,020 --> 02:32:03,860
OkAy.
People,

3697
02:32:03,960 --> 02:32:04,840
you know,
especially with you.

3698
02:32:04,850 --> 02:32:05,683
And again,
do you think that that's the way to do 

3699
02:32:06,321 --> 02:32:08,140
it now?
No.

3700
02:32:08,180 --> 02:32:09,013
With those guys know,
because a lot of those boxers have had 

3701
02:32:11,781 --> 02:32:13,160
three,
400 amateur fights.

3702
02:32:13,280 --> 02:32:14,113
Not like they don't need groomed into.
That may be to get out of the shoe 

3703
02:32:17,481 --> 02:32:20,360
shining amateur style,
but switching notes,

3704
02:32:20,380 --> 02:32:21,920
a headgear getting taken away.
It's more,

3705
02:32:21,921 --> 02:32:22,220
you know,
it's,

3706
02:32:22,220 --> 02:32:25,820
it's set up and the point system,
how it's changing with the olympics,

3707
02:32:25,821 --> 02:32:26,654
you know,
taken into headgear off and how they're 

3708
02:32:28,190 --> 02:32:31,240
changing all that.
So they're coming more professional,

3709
02:32:31,260 --> 02:32:32,510
setting stuff up,
not that,

3710
02:32:32,840 --> 02:32:34,870
you know,
pitter patter shit to shine,

3711
02:32:35,570 --> 02:32:37,010
you know,
that that's how it's been.

3712
02:32:37,011 --> 02:32:39,920
But I don't think they need to be,
be like that.

3713
02:32:39,921 --> 02:32:41,390
But I think in boxing is a huge records.

3714
02:32:41,390 --> 02:32:41,980
Like,
oh,

3715
02:32:41,980 --> 02:32:45,800
he's 37.
Oh it's 28 knockout we're gig.

3716
02:32:45,801 --> 02:32:49,670
I mean I guess the difference with,
with,

3717
02:32:49,740 --> 02:32:50,573
with ufc is use has always had a 
reputation of putting the best fighters 

3718
02:32:55,131 --> 02:32:55,964
against the best fighters,
which I think has gone away a little 

3719
02:32:58,161 --> 02:32:58,994
bit.
I mean they still make sure you get 

3720
02:32:59,660 --> 02:33:01,130
testeD.
Do you think it's gone away?

3721
02:33:01,220 --> 02:33:04,820
I don't think it's going away.
I think when they try to do is have even

3722
02:33:04,821 --> 02:33:08,230
matchups because there's like,
like a uh,

3723
02:33:08,270 --> 02:33:10,860
ricci and uh,
and,

3724
02:33:11,100 --> 02:33:13,640
and what's his name?
Who's fighting alvarez for example?

3725
02:33:13,970 --> 02:33:15,560
They just want to see that fight.
I mean,

3726
02:33:15,561 --> 02:33:16,394
they're both very tough guys.
It can be a champion and and her just 

3727
02:33:20,900 --> 02:33:22,550
teaching,
but they want to see matches,

3728
02:33:22,551 --> 02:33:25,220
but they do that all the way down.
Like tHey're not gonna,

3729
02:33:25,250 --> 02:33:28,870
they're not trying to set up mismatches.
They're,

3730
02:33:29,170 --> 02:33:31,330
they're trying to get it more evenly 
matched,

3731
02:33:31,340 --> 02:33:32,173
but that doesn't mean that there aren't 
guys that they could set up with 

3732
02:33:34,120 --> 02:33:36,080
mismatches within the,
within the

3733
02:33:37,620 --> 02:33:39,830
god get a tune up fight.
We're in boxing.

3734
02:33:39,831 --> 02:33:40,664
It's a big deal.
Or boxing guys get tuned up fights and 

3735
02:33:43,580 --> 02:33:44,413
you even call them a tune up fight.
He's getting a tune up fight before the 

3736
02:33:46,851 --> 02:33:47,970
big match.
Yeah.

3737
02:33:48,080 --> 02:33:48,913
You know,
and they go in there and they fight a 

3738
02:33:49,971 --> 02:33:54,320
guy that's not expected to win and then 
they get sent off for the next fight but

3739
02:33:54,321 --> 02:33:55,154
at tunes theM up,
get some sharp and then they have the 

3740
02:33:56,451 --> 02:33:57,350
world championship fight.

3741
02:33:57,500 --> 02:33:59,750
When that happens to get into the ufc a 
lot though,

3742
02:34:00,560 --> 02:34:01,393
a lot for me,
I have over half of my professional 

3743
02:34:03,801 --> 02:34:06,560
fights are in the ufc.
I signed a five and no,

3744
02:34:07,280 --> 02:34:08,113
and you know,
so I have my plates or been in the ufc 

3745
02:34:10,521 --> 02:34:11,354
against,
you know,

3746
02:34:11,360 --> 02:34:13,700
ufc obviously you can say the primary 
organization with

3747
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:15,230
spiders,
it's not even close,

3748
02:34:15,231 --> 02:34:17,500
but it's getting close now.
You know,

3749
02:34:17,501 --> 02:34:19,570
wHen you look at what bellah tor is 
doing right now,

3750
02:34:19,630 --> 02:34:21,640
it's,
ufc is always going to be the top of the

3751
02:34:21,641 --> 02:34:22,474
food chain.
It's always like the premier 

3752
02:34:23,801 --> 02:34:27,760
organization as far as the public knows.
But as far as the quality of talent,

3753
02:34:27,960 --> 02:34:31,100
bella tour,
at least finally as Roy Mcdonald,

3754
02:34:31,430 --> 02:34:32,263
you know,
they finally have all the that are 

3755
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,310
growing.
They are as well.

3756
02:34:36,311 --> 02:34:37,144
Yeah,
you're right.

3757
02:34:37,150 --> 02:34:39,210
But I mean getting um,
you know,

3758
02:34:39,280 --> 02:34:39,761
gay harden,
blue,

3759
02:34:39,761 --> 02:34:41,740
saucy,
worldclass guys,

3760
02:34:41,770 --> 02:34:44,080
we're like legitimately with pay.
Yeah.

3761
02:34:44,081 --> 02:34:47,770
I mean rory has a victory over tyron 
woodley and a victory of a daemon maya.

3762
02:34:47,860 --> 02:34:50,260
So he had a victory over the one and 
nuMber two guys,

3763
02:34:50,580 --> 02:34:51,413
it's interesting you just mentioned roy 
can go back to what we're talking about 

3764
02:34:53,911 --> 02:34:57,480
with training rory.
I mean that's a guy who,

3765
02:34:58,050 --> 02:34:58,883
he's a strange character and like I 
wonder what goes on is what's his 

3766
02:35:01,951 --> 02:35:03,870
motivation for fighting?
And what started him,

3767
02:35:03,871 --> 02:35:05,760
et cetera,
but I saw him do a,

3768
02:35:05,761 --> 02:35:07,130
uh,
uh,

3769
02:35:07,140 --> 02:35:08,850
an interview about his training.
He's like,

3770
02:35:08,851 --> 02:35:09,684
I'm like,
I talked about coaches making you do 

3771
02:35:11,521 --> 02:35:13,110
shit just in.
You're just like,

3772
02:35:13,140 --> 02:35:15,090
do whatever the coach says.
He was like,

3773
02:35:15,091 --> 02:35:15,924
look,
I've been doing with all the coaches 

3774
02:35:16,621 --> 02:35:17,700
say,
he's like,

3775
02:35:17,730 --> 02:35:18,930
I'm gonna.
I keep getting hurt.

3776
02:35:18,931 --> 02:35:20,100
I keep doing this.
And now he goes,

3777
02:35:20,101 --> 02:35:22,500
I'm going to take things into my own 
hands a little bit more.

3778
02:35:22,910 --> 02:35:23,970
You know,
he's the guy that did that,

3779
02:35:23,971 --> 02:35:24,804
but he's,
he's having a lot of friggen success 

3780
02:35:26,550 --> 02:35:28,890
too.
He looked like a fucking world killer.

3781
02:35:29,050 --> 02:35:33,010
And he'd be paul daley.
He looked perfectly savage to.

3782
02:35:33,030 --> 02:35:33,430
Yes.

3783
02:35:33,430 --> 02:35:35,680
Yes.
That's gonna be an interesting fight.

3784
02:35:35,710 --> 02:35:38,080
Paul daley and lorenz larkin.
Oh yeah.

3785
02:35:39,040 --> 02:35:42,790
Explosive style.
Supercycle kicks.

3786
02:35:42,800 --> 02:35:43,580
Yeah.
I'll just.

3787
02:35:43,580 --> 02:35:45,880
How this longer than use.
Nope.

3788
02:35:46,300 --> 02:35:49,310
Nolan's lorenz larkin just fought 
douglas lema for the title.

3789
02:35:49,311 --> 02:35:52,420
We lost a five round decision.
Very close fight.

3790
02:35:52,421 --> 02:35:54,520
Very good fight.
Douglas slam is another one.

3791
02:35:54,521 --> 02:35:56,080
That guy is world class.
I mean,

3792
02:35:56,081 --> 02:35:56,914
he is.
He's right up there with anybody in the 

3793
02:35:57,641 --> 02:35:58,960
world at one 70,
in my opinion.

3794
02:35:59,070 --> 02:36:01,410
He's been around for awhile too.
Yeah.

3795
02:36:01,450 --> 02:36:02,283
Yeah.
You know what pisses me off is ben 

3796
02:36:03,480 --> 02:36:07,170
aspirins still fighting over in one fc 
like jesus christ I,

3797
02:36:07,390 --> 02:36:11,890
I am the number one district of his 
retirement fight.

3798
02:36:11,891 --> 02:36:13,810
That's.
It drives me crazy.

3799
02:36:13,840 --> 02:36:16,900
Should've been the ufc a long time ago.
I always wanted to see that

3800
02:36:17,490 --> 02:36:19,620
pissed off.
Dana and his style is weird,

3801
02:36:19,621 --> 02:36:19,990
right?

3802
02:36:19,990 --> 02:36:21,460
The style is weird.
That's one thing,

3803
02:36:21,461 --> 02:36:23,830
but pissing off dana was ultimately the 
end of it all.

3804
02:36:23,890 --> 02:36:25,930
I mean,
he was talking some serious shit.

3805
02:36:29,300 --> 02:36:31,420
Yeah,
that's too bad.

3806
02:36:31,720 --> 02:36:33,550
That's too bad.
Really bad.

3807
02:36:33,551 --> 02:36:35,830
I will have it mixed up with this guy 
and fuck you.

3808
02:36:35,831 --> 02:36:39,790
I would have loved to see that guy fight
the best in the world in the ufc,

3809
02:36:39,791 --> 02:36:40,840
you know,
and we'll never know.

3810
02:36:40,841 --> 02:36:42,160
Now.
It's really unfortunate.

3811
02:36:42,730 --> 02:36:45,340
He made some decent money over there and
I hope you did.

3812
02:36:45,400 --> 02:36:47,940
I hope we did.
He's just a fucking phenomenal grappler,

3813
02:36:48,050 --> 02:36:49,930
man.
Here's a perfect example.

3814
02:36:50,260 --> 02:36:51,093
That guy destroyed larkin on the ground 
or it's not locking lima destroyed him 

3815
02:36:55,241 --> 02:36:58,930
on the ground and destroyed core cuff on
the ground just to be manhandled.

3816
02:36:58,990 --> 02:37:01,780
Those dudes got a.
Of those guys was ragdoll and fools.

3817
02:37:01,781 --> 02:37:06,580
Just throwing them around like that.
An orthodox weird wrestling style.

3818
02:37:06,610 --> 02:37:08,790
I wouldn't have wanted to see him fight 
the best guys.

3819
02:37:09,080 --> 02:37:10,580
Yeah.
You know who had been a.

3820
02:37:10,910 --> 02:37:15,160
He would have been a terrible matchup 
for is george st pierre was.

3821
02:37:15,350 --> 02:37:16,310
George always

3822
02:37:16,370 --> 02:37:19,490
saw he starts hitting his nice little 
shots,

3823
02:37:19,491 --> 02:37:21,390
but he always ends up getting the nice 
tape now.

3824
02:37:21,391 --> 02:37:23,360
But how was he going to do in grappling 
against?

3825
02:37:23,361 --> 02:37:24,520
Asked her.
That would've been a good one.

3826
02:37:24,521 --> 02:37:26,480
I saw and I always wanted to see too.
Well,

3827
02:37:26,481 --> 02:37:28,760
you know that got him in trouble with 
johny hendricks.

3828
02:37:28,761 --> 02:37:31,040
Right.
But johnny hunters is a different Johnny

3829
02:37:31,040 --> 02:37:31,873
Hendricks back then.
Yeah,

3830
02:37:31,910 --> 02:37:32,743
sure.
Interesting.

3831
02:37:35,130 --> 02:37:38,480
You saw this trip and changing lives,
bro.

3832
02:37:39,100 --> 02:37:40,530
I sit that I.
That's,

3833
02:37:40,560 --> 02:37:43,700
that's one of the thing that makes me 
want to get back into it is now that you

3834
02:37:43,701 --> 02:37:44,534
saw it as an.
I still have you saw to test me just in 

3835
02:37:46,311 --> 02:37:48,840
case there's an opportunity that pops up
because yeah,

3836
02:37:48,890 --> 02:37:50,480
they,
they pop in all the time.

3837
02:37:50,860 --> 02:37:53,300
60 a buck 60 right now.
What do you book?

3838
02:37:53,330 --> 02:37:54,163
60.
Do you think you could get done look up 

3839
02:37:56,070 --> 02:37:56,930
anyone in the world?

3840
02:37:56,930 --> 02:37:59,690
Absolutely.
That's my guy.

3841
02:38:01,250 --> 02:38:05,330
He'll come in and he does practices with
us and shit will always give them a hard

3842
02:38:05,331 --> 02:38:05,811
time like,
oh,

3843
02:38:05,811 --> 02:38:07,430
he's still got it.
you still gotta?

3844
02:38:08,390 --> 02:38:10,520
Yeah,
he's retired.

3845
02:38:10,521 --> 02:38:12,300
Are you kind of retired?
Mostly.

3846
02:38:12,770 --> 02:38:14,780
Mostly retired.
I'm retired.

3847
02:38:14,781 --> 02:38:15,614
I,
I'm,

3848
02:38:15,920 --> 02:38:18,470
I'm definitely retired,
but I'm not a first off.

3849
02:38:18,471 --> 02:38:19,304
I love the fight.
That's the hard thing about retiring is 

3850
02:38:20,931 --> 02:38:25,160
it takes so much time,
energy and there's so much to learn that

3851
02:38:25,161 --> 02:38:25,994
I'm definitely a better fighter when I 
retired than I than I was when I was in 

3852
02:38:31,450 --> 02:38:34,640
my prime.
Meaning as far as skillset goes,

3853
02:38:35,090 --> 02:38:35,923
but like there's a lot of skill guys out
there and it's just like a focus thing 

3854
02:38:39,391 --> 02:38:42,100
and a motivation thing like.
So you wish there were,

3855
02:38:42,170 --> 02:38:43,790
you saw it.
It was there the entire career.

3856
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:45,860
Oh god.
Are you kidding me?

3857
02:38:46,400 --> 02:38:47,233
Hell,
you ever feel any temptation when you 

3858
02:38:48,561 --> 02:38:50,280
knew that so many guys were using shade?

3859
02:38:50,300 --> 02:38:52,840
I had,
I had a couple week.

3860
02:38:52,850 --> 02:38:53,683
We'll sit down and try to talk me into 
it before they tried to talk you into 

3861
02:38:56,350 --> 02:38:57,230
just like,
hey,

3862
02:38:57,231 --> 02:38:58,064
you know,
like everybody's doing it but this and 

3863
02:39:01,331 --> 02:39:01,891
that,
blah,

3864
02:39:01,891 --> 02:39:03,120
blah,
blah.

3865
02:39:03,920 --> 02:39:07,550
I forget What the.
Somebody had talked about it and I had a

3866
02:39:07,551 --> 02:39:11,090
coach a long time ago that was like,
hey everybody.

3867
02:39:11,420 --> 02:39:12,770
And I'm like,
no,

3868
02:39:12,890 --> 02:39:14,160
I don't think so.
I,

3869
02:39:14,180 --> 02:39:18,410
I take a lot of pride in the fact that I
had in my career and I didn't.

3870
02:39:18,500 --> 02:39:19,950
I'm like oblivious.
I'm like,

3871
02:39:20,090 --> 02:39:21,140
like,
you knoW,

3872
02:39:21,410 --> 02:39:24,590
like when you're not In the circle,
you're definitely not in the circle.

3873
02:39:24,640 --> 02:39:25,480
Yeah.
They don't tell you,

3874
02:39:25,710 --> 02:39:27,020
tell you.
They don't want to tell you,

3875
02:39:27,021 --> 02:39:28,040
you know,
everything else.

3876
02:39:28,250 --> 02:39:31,610
So I,
I think a lot of pride in the fact that.

3877
02:39:31,680 --> 02:39:34,820
And I,
and I teach to my guys and that's one of

3878
02:39:34,821 --> 02:39:36,350
the conversations I've had with cody.

3879
02:39:36,350 --> 02:39:37,183
I'm like,
bro,

3880
02:39:37,830 --> 02:39:39,980
you know,
we don't need any of that shit.

3881
02:39:39,981 --> 02:39:41,780
Dude.
That's all mental.

3882
02:39:41,781 --> 02:39:45,470
It's a mental thing.
The problem is that the differences when

3883
02:39:45,471 --> 02:39:46,304
you have someone that strong mentally 
that is like a scientist on himself and 

3884
02:39:49,200 --> 02:39:51,320
also has all the attributes,
then it matters,

3885
02:39:51,330 --> 02:39:53,810
right?
When you get a guy in math class fighter

3886
02:39:53,811 --> 02:39:56,900
and then on top of that they take some 
shit and then yeah,

3887
02:39:56,901 --> 02:39:58,260
they have the mentality,
right?

3888
02:39:58,270 --> 02:39:59,103
If everybody's doing it mentalities,
which allows like champions to do it as 

3889
02:40:01,911 --> 02:40:02,744
well.
Right.

3890
02:40:03,020 --> 02:40:05,270
This champion never did it.
Congratulations.

3891
02:40:05,390 --> 02:40:06,350
Thanks.
Beautiful.

3892
02:40:06,550 --> 02:40:07,660
I mean,
all right,

3893
02:40:08,150 --> 02:40:10,750
let's wrap this bitch up.
Good luck man.

3894
02:40:10,790 --> 02:40:12,380
