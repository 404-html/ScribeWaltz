1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,350
Yes,

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,790
that's my ode to Brody Stevens.

3
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:03,571
What's up brother?

4
00:00:03,571 --> 00:00:04,050
How are you?

5
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:04,970
Good to see Ya mate.

6
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:06,180
I can't believe I'm here again.

7
00:00:06,181 --> 00:00:06,780
This is awesome.

8
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:07,101
I'm clam.

9
00:00:07,101 --> 00:00:08,000
Believe you here again too.

10
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,890
I can't believe five days ago
you were in a world title fight.

11
00:00:10,891 --> 00:00:11,221
Look at you.

12
00:00:11,221 --> 00:00:11,820
You look great.

13
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:12,271
Yeah,

14
00:00:12,271 --> 00:00:12,930
it was um,

15
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,000
straight after the fire
had their hospital.

16
00:00:15,001 --> 00:00:16,290
I spent about four hours in hospital.

17
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:17,101
I thought I broke my foot,

18
00:00:17,101 --> 00:00:19,500
but luckily all the x
rays came back clear.

19
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:20,150
Uh,

20
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:21,360
swelling's going down a lot now.

21
00:00:21,361 --> 00:00:22,750
So I once Asia,

22
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,510
I didn't think I was going to be
at a fight December the fifth.

23
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:25,621
It looks like ammonia with,

24
00:00:25,621 --> 00:00:26,454
I'm sorry.

25
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,490
Oh Wow.

26
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:27,740
Okay.

27
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:28,170
So you,

28
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,460
did you kick an elbow or something?

29
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,570
Like he knows I keep these
names about half a dozen times.

30
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,370
I didn't hurt and cause my face was so
jacked up from all the cuts and then it

31
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:39,510
wasn't until I was getting stitched up.

32
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,730
Then I noticed my foot
was that into go elephant,

33
00:00:41,731 --> 00:00:43,950
try to band and then a,

34
00:00:43,951 --> 00:00:44,870
and then once the stitches,

35
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,730
then I cyborg come into the
change room to get a photo of me.

36
00:00:47,731 --> 00:00:48,900
And as I stood up to get a photo with her,

37
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:50,760
then I realized the pain
was rushing to my foot.

38
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:51,121
I was like,

39
00:00:51,121 --> 00:00:51,870
okay,

40
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,860
I think my foot's broken so straight.

41
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,140
Luckily there was an ambulance there.

42
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,180
We'll get straight into
the emergency and then um,

43
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:57,631
yeah,

44
00:00:57,631 --> 00:00:58,890
it was good onto the,

45
00:00:58,891 --> 00:00:59,310
uh,

46
00:00:59,310 --> 00:00:59,760
the,

47
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,511
the painkillers,

48
00:01:00,511 --> 00:01:01,800
which took me into a different dimension.

49
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:03,450
What did they give you?

50
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:03,880
Oh,

51
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,300
it's stuff that's,

52
00:01:05,301 --> 00:01:05,580
um,

53
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:05,971
different,

54
00:01:05,971 --> 00:01:08,160
different names here in
America to Australia,

55
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:13,190
but I'm like oxy code owns or something
like illustrating with an injection.

56
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:14,580
Probably Morphine.

57
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,210
Yeah.

58
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,043
And then,

59
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:16,980
uh,

60
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,260
this pink elephant came into the room
and started chatting to me as in,

61
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,113
hey,

62
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:21,370
the,

63
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:22,320
your foot's not broken,

64
00:01:22,321 --> 00:01:22,920
but uh,

65
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,460
you are in a different galaxy now.

66
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:26,303
Say Welcome.

67
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,360
And that was pretty cool.

68
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,700
It was a really a pink elephant
and he just fucking around.

69
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,990
I could be possibly a fucking around.

70
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:34,883
So you got,

71
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,780
you've had 300 and how many
stitches in your 15 year?

72
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,070
Three 15 315 I broke,

73
00:01:41,071 --> 00:01:44,940
I broke 300 about four weeks
before I got to America with a,

74
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,930
an accident and the gym,

75
00:01:45,931 --> 00:01:47,430
sparring and I thought okay,

76
00:01:47,431 --> 00:01:48,450
300 year beauty.

77
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,990
And then cosmo was,

78
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,000
cosmo was polite enough to give me
another two cuts with another 15 stitches.

79
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,600
So now I thought my,

80
00:01:55,601 --> 00:02:00,360
my plateau was three hundreds and now my
next goal is I guess is 400 cause I've

81
00:02:00,361 --> 00:02:01,610
already passed the three point line.

82
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,370
Goodness.

83
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,440
Who's got the most stitches
in their face ever.

84
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:05,150
And my tie.

85
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,510
Oh that's a good question.

86
00:02:06,511 --> 00:02:07,630
I'm not going to have to be close.

87
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:08,650
I gotta be up there.

88
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,593
I'd have to be,

89
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:10,500
um,

90
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,810
but I'm starting to now and my doctor,

91
00:02:12,811 --> 00:02:13,231
he said,

92
00:02:13,231 --> 00:02:13,530
uh,

93
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,960
because I bring my own doctor with me
when I come to fight everywhere around the

94
00:02:15,961 --> 00:02:17,730
world and he said it's just scars.

95
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,760
Speaking on scars now is um,

96
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,560
the Nick Diaz sorta eyebrows.

97
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,290
So this one's had at least maybe 18 alone.

98
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:25,500
This,

99
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,670
this ice one laughed.

100
00:02:26,671 --> 00:02:27,504
I 80,

101
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,510
80 still dressed the main cause that's
the right elbow two coming down.

102
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,453
So yeah,

103
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,250
well that's the knock on
mortar as opposed to glory,

104
00:02:35,251 --> 00:02:37,110
which unfortunately they just got,

105
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,840
they just lost their,

106
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:43,950
their deal with spike TV or canceled
their agreement with spike to you.

107
00:02:43,951 --> 00:02:44,820
I don't know what happens,

108
00:02:44,821 --> 00:02:46,410
but they pulled glory off spike,

109
00:02:46,411 --> 00:02:51,411
which is really very disappointing
for me as a fan of a kickboxing.

110
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:55,500
And I was just hoping that
that would translate into,

111
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:56,490
you know,

112
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,690
just to people getting a more,

113
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,400
more understanding in this country of,

114
00:02:59,401 --> 00:03:00,234
of a

115
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,690
high level kickboxing.

116
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:01,930
Yeah.

117
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:02,763
You know,

118
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:03,603
um,

119
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:04,620
he um,

120
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,550
glory,

121
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,650
glory was the the one and then
the head of the line fight.

122
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,550
So I reached out to Scott Kent with
the lion fighting at hell mate.

123
00:03:11,551 --> 00:03:12,660
Is there any chance you can put me on?

124
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:13,903
Um,

125
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,030
I seen how much exposure that
having with access TV and uh,

126
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,300
and with there,

127
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:21,680
with the deal with everyone in the world
is paying attention to the lifeline

128
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:22,440
right now.

129
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,390
And because it's pure my attire as well,

130
00:03:24,391 --> 00:03:24,751
I thought,

131
00:03:24,751 --> 00:03:25,050
um,

132
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:25,201
is,

133
00:03:25,201 --> 00:03:27,210
is that this is definitely in
the show to try and be on to,

134
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,260
to raise the profile.

135
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,160
So I'm,

136
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,240
I jumped on board and then,

137
00:03:30,241 --> 00:03:30,850
uh,

138
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,910
I'm so devastated that I lost it was,

139
00:03:32,911 --> 00:03:33,970
it was such a tough fight,

140
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,910
but at the same time,

141
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,250
even now I'm lost and I'm sad.

142
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,120
I knew that I,

143
00:03:39,121 --> 00:03:40,200
I gave 100%.

144
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,160
Um,

145
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,851
and hopefully the,

146
00:03:41,851 --> 00:03:45,300
the Crowder was an entertaining enough
to hopefully invite me back and hopefully

147
00:03:45,301 --> 00:03:46,470
Scott was happy with my performance.

148
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:46,980
So was a,

149
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,240
it was a great fun fight.

150
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,090
But what I was going to say is
a glory doesn't have elbows.

151
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,570
And the,

152
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:51,760
the,

153
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,760
the thing that people worry about with
like lion fight and pure Moy Tai is that

154
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,130
there's a lot of cuts in,

155
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,260
a lot of people get cut and
primarily get cut by elbows.

156
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:01,770
Yes.

157
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:02,603
But you know,

158
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:03,450
the way I look at it,

159
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,680
it's like that is a,

160
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,270
it's a,

161
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,510
it's an excellent weapon.

162
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,020
And if you should be able to kick or if
you are able to kick and you're able to

163
00:04:10,021 --> 00:04:14,400
need the face and you're able to do
all the things that you can in MMA,

164
00:04:14,401 --> 00:04:16,710
why can't you elbow and in my time,

165
00:04:16,711 --> 00:04:16,891
you know,

166
00:04:16,891 --> 00:04:17,970
and why can't you clinch,

167
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,103
you know,

168
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,620
it's exactly the same as MMA.

169
00:04:20,621 --> 00:04:21,310
How can you,

170
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:25,570
how can you take away the rules and
water it down into one sort of category?

171
00:04:25,571 --> 00:04:26,260
And then,

172
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,093
and then called,

173
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,760
I think it's the same deal when
they think Corbett came over here,

174
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,500
he's the elbow master.

175
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,200
Um,

176
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,270
and then when he came over here to
fight for glory and he got beaten by

177
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:36,640
spoiling,

178
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,980
he got beaten by Saki and everyone saying,

179
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:39,521
well,

180
00:04:39,521 --> 00:04:40,530
but if he had his elbows,

181
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,231
that would have changed.

182
00:04:41,231 --> 00:04:41,580
The

183
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,413
maybe,

184
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:42,901
who knows?

185
00:04:42,901 --> 00:04:43,501
You never know,

186
00:04:43,501 --> 00:04:44,071
but you never know.

187
00:04:44,071 --> 00:04:45,060
Certainly it's,

188
00:04:45,061 --> 00:04:46,170
it makes you think,

189
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:51,620
and you know when you're thinking that's
bad in the cage or the ring or wherever

190
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:52,523
you're competing,

191
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:57,770
the idea is to train so hard and train
exactly how you're going to fight so that

192
00:04:58,291 --> 00:04:59,580
it all comes out automatically.

193
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,680
And when your automatic
instinct for Nathan,

194
00:05:01,681 --> 00:05:01,861
I mean,

195
00:05:01,861 --> 00:05:02,551
how many fights is,

196
00:05:02,551 --> 00:05:03,510
he had a,

197
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:04,860
I think close to 70.

198
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,251
Yeah.

199
00:05:05,251 --> 00:05:05,521
I mean,

200
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:06,600
think about all those fights.

201
00:05:06,601 --> 00:05:07,860
Did he add throwing elbows?

202
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,450
Think about all those training sessions,

203
00:05:09,451 --> 00:05:10,284
throwing elbows,

204
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,510
and then all of a sudden he's
in positions where it's like,

205
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:12,751
okay,

206
00:05:12,751 --> 00:05:14,670
don't throw an album
because that's normal.

207
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,290
You're getting in the clinch and it just,

208
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:16,420
it,

209
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,880
it's just normal for you.

210
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:18,270
Yes.

211
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,800
And then all of a sudden they
tell you you can't do it.

212
00:05:19,801 --> 00:05:20,550
I mean,

213
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:20,770
I,

214
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:21,810
it's problematic.

215
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:22,141
I mean it's,

216
00:05:22,141 --> 00:05:25,110
it's nice for these guys to be
able to have another outlet.

217
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,190
I know Tyrone,

218
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:27,570
Tyrone Spong is,

219
00:05:27,571 --> 00:05:29,160
I'm doing some boxing down,

220
00:05:29,161 --> 00:05:30,180
just some straight boxing,

221
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:33,270
which I think probably
at least he has shoes on.

222
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,890
So it'd be just thinking that he's,

223
00:05:34,891 --> 00:05:35,191
you know,

224
00:05:35,191 --> 00:05:35,700
like it'll,

225
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,780
it'll help him not throw kicks and not
thinking you can throw elbows and things,

226
00:05:39,781 --> 00:05:44,490
but the guys who are the best and
the guys who are the the best,

227
00:05:44,491 --> 00:05:45,000
uh,

228
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,040
at that particular style of Moitai,

229
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,260
it'd be great to see them
use all their weapons.

230
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,080
It'd be great to see them utilize
all the techniques of Muay Thai.

231
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,930
He see how technical when we tie is,

232
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:55,831
you know,

233
00:05:55,831 --> 00:05:56,061
I thought,

234
00:05:56,061 --> 00:06:01,061
I don't think people from the outside
that are watching it appreciate it for

235
00:06:01,521 --> 00:06:02,510
what it really is.

236
00:06:02,511 --> 00:06:06,980
It's an incredibly intense
and technical martial art.

237
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:07,521
Yeah.

238
00:06:07,521 --> 00:06:08,710
We'll Thailand's uh,

239
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,560
how many hundred years old say
it's already a perfected to the,

240
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:16,550
to the rule set and then everyone's
trying to water it down to them to make it

241
00:06:16,551 --> 00:06:18,530
their own specific sorta rule set.

242
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:18,840
And then,

243
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,673
um,

244
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,110
it's not the authentic,

245
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,580
when you keep it as it is,

246
00:06:22,581 --> 00:06:23,061
it's already,

247
00:06:23,061 --> 00:06:24,440
the products are already there.

248
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,610
You don't have to change it.

249
00:06:25,611 --> 00:06:26,120
It's already,

250
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,520
it's already been fine on
perfect enough and fast.

251
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:29,770
And so it's a,

252
00:06:29,771 --> 00:06:32,270
it's a shame that a different
organizations trying to,

253
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,583
but I,

254
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,720
I suppose people don't
like the clincher as much.

255
00:06:35,721 --> 00:06:36,111
Sometimes.

256
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:37,310
I think it's getting a little bit boring.

257
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,810
And plus when you get
two guys that aren't,

258
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:39,910
uh,

259
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:40,850
at a certain level,

260
00:06:40,851 --> 00:06:42,920
it does seem a little bit sorta doll.

261
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,150
It's not entertaining.

262
00:06:44,151 --> 00:06:48,050
But in the early levels
grapplings and very low level.

263
00:06:48,051 --> 00:06:49,790
So it was a lot of things at a low level.

264
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:50,210
Yes.

265
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:55,210
But I don't think you should ever sort
of make rules that are dictated just to

266
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:59,060
make people that are at a low
level fight in a more fan friendly,

267
00:06:59,061 --> 00:06:59,690
enjoyable way.

268
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:03,470
I think you should just allow the
people that are watching it to see the

269
00:07:03,471 --> 00:07:07,130
difference between a novice and someone
who's an expert and see someone who uses

270
00:07:07,131 --> 00:07:11,060
the clinch to their advantage and see
all the different techniques that can be

271
00:07:11,061 --> 00:07:12,170
landed from the clinch,

272
00:07:12,171 --> 00:07:13,370
the uses of the need,

273
00:07:13,371 --> 00:07:14,120
the use of the knees,

274
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,740
the elbows from the break.

275
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:16,281
You know,

276
00:07:16,281 --> 00:07:20,000
there's a lot of beautiful techniques
that can be used from the clinch that you

277
00:07:20,001 --> 00:07:25,001
don't see because what glory has done is
sort of adopt the rules of k one which

278
00:07:25,251 --> 00:07:26,900
the Japanese had kind of decided,

279
00:07:26,901 --> 00:07:27,201
hey,

280
00:07:27,201 --> 00:07:31,100
there's gotta be a way to make these
guys fight in a more exciting and fast

281
00:07:31,101 --> 00:07:31,934
paced way.

282
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,410
What's make the rounds,

283
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:33,920
you know,

284
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,120
just what's a,

285
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:38,180
to make the fight shorter instead
of having like many rounds,

286
00:07:38,181 --> 00:07:40,520
like 10 rounds or 12 rounds
or something like that,

287
00:07:40,521 --> 00:07:41,450
like a boxing match,

288
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:45,830
let's just do like three rounds and have
them go fucking crazy for three rounds,

289
00:07:45,831 --> 00:07:46,330
you know?

290
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:46,580
Yeah.

291
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,450
When I fought in Europe,

292
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:47,850
uh,

293
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:48,370
that was,

294
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:51,920
that afforded an organization
called Super League back in 2003,

295
00:07:51,921 --> 00:07:54,050
2004 and that was the same deal.

296
00:07:54,051 --> 00:07:54,291
Again,

297
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,640
we're not gonna spend airfare,

298
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:59,390
money flowing all the way from Australia
and get cut in the first round and have

299
00:07:59,391 --> 00:08:00,980
the flight stop 60 seconds in.

300
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,510
Otherwise it's a waste of money for us.

301
00:08:02,511 --> 00:08:02,920
So,

302
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,281
so we'll,

303
00:08:03,281 --> 00:08:03,770
we'll,

304
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:04,161
we'll keep,

305
00:08:04,161 --> 00:08:05,180
the knees will keep everything else,

306
00:08:05,181 --> 00:08:07,140
but we'll just eliminate and
elbows just from case to the,

307
00:08:07,141 --> 00:08:08,150
that that does happen.

308
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:09,950
Does I'm lion fight,

309
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,060
do drug testing?

310
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:11,871
Uh,

311
00:08:11,871 --> 00:08:12,021
I,

312
00:08:12,021 --> 00:08:13,700
there was no urinary test.

313
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:14,240
Half the money.

314
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,050
Nothing.

315
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:15,883
Wow.

316
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:20,480
And then I think we're in Vegas and uh,

317
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,270
now they've moved to Timmy,

318
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:22,760
Michaela,

319
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,740
and then I think on
the other side as well.

320
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,540
I forget the other place that has,

321
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,463
but um,

322
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:27,950
no,

323
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:28,461
there was no,

324
00:08:28,461 --> 00:08:28,671
no,

325
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:32,330
I'm waiting for a job for
me now is a Temecula the,

326
00:08:32,331 --> 00:08:32,531
it's,

327
00:08:32,531 --> 00:08:33,380
it's a casino,

328
00:08:33,381 --> 00:08:34,030
right?

329
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:34,560
You guys ready?

330
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,990
A Casino Chang goes out.

331
00:08:35,991 --> 00:08:36,824
What it is.

332
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:40,910
And is that a native American reservation
where they can do whatever they want?

333
00:08:40,911 --> 00:08:41,990
They have their own regulations.

334
00:08:41,991 --> 00:08:42,710
Yes.

335
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:42,921
You know,

336
00:08:42,921 --> 00:08:44,420
they kept a martial arts.

337
00:08:44,421 --> 00:08:46,460
A lot of mixed martial
arts live in California.

338
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:46,791
Okay.

339
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:50,570
You have a native American reservations
did because they put on a king of the

340
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:55,410
cage in a native American reservations
when you couldn't have MMA in California.

341
00:08:55,411 --> 00:08:56,244
It was illegal.

342
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,640
And so we used to drive out to the middle
of nowhere to these very small native

343
00:09:01,711 --> 00:09:02,790
American casinos.

344
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:03,541
And,

345
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:03,960
uh,

346
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,460
that's where the king
of the cage would be.

347
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,180
And that's,

348
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,980
that was like the primary way that,

349
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,260
that's how like Uriah Faber got started.

350
00:09:10,261 --> 00:09:12,270
A lot of guys quit and
Jackson got started.

351
00:09:12,271 --> 00:09:16,890
A lot of guys get started and king in the
cage and in California because of this

352
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,740
loophole that allows native American
reservations put on the fights.

353
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,740
But boy,

354
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,710
I would like it if they drug tested guys.

355
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:23,130
Yeah.

356
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:23,960
You know?

357
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,330
Yeah.

358
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,930
I definitely feel a lot safer if I
knew it wasn't faithful lighting.

359
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:31,380
A pure animals did just
do the Jews to the tits.

360
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:31,871
Well,

361
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:32,191
Cosmo,

362
00:09:32,191 --> 00:09:34,410
Xander is a big fella and um,

363
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,000
he's quite a bit larger than you.

364
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,460
Yeah.

365
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,500
The guy that you fought was,

366
00:09:37,501 --> 00:09:37,880
uh,

367
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,260
he's,

368
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:38,740
um,

369
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,310
he's a bad six three.

370
00:09:40,311 --> 00:09:40,800
He then went to,

371
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,180
when they announcing this at six one,

372
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:43,470
but there's no way six one,

373
00:09:43,471 --> 00:09:44,460
when I was looking up at him,

374
00:09:44,461 --> 00:09:45,540
when the referee borders together,

375
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,190
uh,

376
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,750
it was like looking at
a Michael Jordan or Sam.

377
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:48,991
I said,

378
00:09:48,991 --> 00:09:49,824
Holy Shit.

379
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:50,791
And then,

380
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:51,600
uh,

381
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:51,991
and then,

382
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:52,111
uh,

383
00:09:52,111 --> 00:09:53,670
once the fight starts to just,

384
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:54,840
just trying to present,

385
00:09:54,841 --> 00:09:55,171
get there,

386
00:09:55,171 --> 00:09:56,030
get into his range.

387
00:09:56,031 --> 00:09:58,830
It was either as you explode into,

388
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:00,630
try and try and learn your combinations,

389
00:10:00,631 --> 00:10:01,940
those knees are flying past,

390
00:10:01,941 --> 00:10:03,410
pass your head left and right.

391
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:04,263
It's uh,

392
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,430
it's just makes it so much,

393
00:10:05,431 --> 00:10:07,410
so much harder when they
say [inaudible] and I'm,

394
00:10:07,411 --> 00:10:09,650
the funny thing is he can
make I think seventies,

395
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,940
one 55 he can eat and
cut all the way down.

396
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,223
Yeah.

397
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:13,920
He's,

398
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,440
last fight before he
fought me was 79 kilos.

399
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:17,490
And I know before that he's fought.

400
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:18,324
It's 70.

401
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,260
And um,

402
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:19,501
Ben,

403
00:10:19,501 --> 00:10:20,580
he's not a skinny 70.

404
00:10:20,581 --> 00:10:21,150
They once he,

405
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,160
once he feels right out after lane,

406
00:10:23,161 --> 00:10:23,371
he's,

407
00:10:23,371 --> 00:10:23,730
um,

408
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:28,450
he's still at the muscles and he still
looks like if they say he's gay and he's,

409
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,220
and to his credit,

410
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:29,460
um,

411
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:32,970
I baiting him back in 2008,

412
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:33,870
and um,

413
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,600
he's just improved it leaps in Brown's,

414
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:36,240
um,

415
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,490
the way that he fought me on Friday night.

416
00:10:38,491 --> 00:10:39,510
He fought really well.

417
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,560
He used his range.

418
00:10:40,561 --> 00:10:40,911
He used,

419
00:10:40,911 --> 00:10:41,910
I'm good power.

420
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,550
His power is so in crazy everything.

421
00:10:44,551 --> 00:10:44,790
He's,

422
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,000
everything he hit me with was um,

423
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,860
loaded.

424
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,760
So it good,

425
00:10:47,761 --> 00:10:48,090
full,

426
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:48,781
full credit to him.

427
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:49,614
I try my best.

428
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:50,340
Um,

429
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:50,851
but yeah,

430
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:51,920
he was just um,

431
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,823
on his game.

432
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:53,131
Yeah,

433
00:10:53,131 --> 00:10:53,701
he looked very,

434
00:10:53,701 --> 00:10:54,361
very sharp.

435
00:10:54,361 --> 00:10:55,680
There was some great
moments in that fight.

436
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,910
It's really interesting man.

437
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,430
You have a way of moving a very,

438
00:10:59,431 --> 00:11:04,350
a very specific way of moving inside
of the octagon or inside the the ring

439
00:11:04,351 --> 00:11:04,860
rather.

440
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,090
If I watched you like it
just silhouette of Sherman's,

441
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,510
someone showed me a silhouette
of you move and I go,

442
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,500
oh that's John Wayne par.

443
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,011
I got,

444
00:11:11,011 --> 00:11:12,520
you could totally tell it's,

445
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:13,530
it's so interesting.

446
00:11:13,531 --> 00:11:17,210
You have your own very
specific style of a,

447
00:11:17,211 --> 00:11:17,970
of moving.

448
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,310
And I would imagine
that that style is like,

449
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:20,821
I mean,

450
00:11:20,821 --> 00:11:23,760
you do a lot of things that
are other more Thai guys do.

451
00:11:23,761 --> 00:11:23,971
Look,

452
00:11:23,971 --> 00:11:25,350
you're very light on the front foot,

453
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:29,340
but there's a way you have of throwing
punches and combinations and so heavy off

454
00:11:29,341 --> 00:11:32,370
that front left leg is
very specific to you.

455
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,091
You know,

456
00:11:33,091 --> 00:11:35,310
and I think that for a lot of guys,

457
00:11:35,311 --> 00:11:36,330
let's kind of present them.

458
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,520
Who is your,

459
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,363
um,

460
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,600
it's very effective.

461
00:11:39,601 --> 00:11:40,560
But it's unique,

462
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:41,340
you know,

463
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,030
and it can,

464
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,650
your style of movement,

465
00:11:43,651 --> 00:11:44,100
it's like,

466
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:44,401
I don't,

467
00:11:44,401 --> 00:11:45,660
I can't think of another guy.

468
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,250
Like if I watch certain guys,

469
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:47,641
I go,

470
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:48,780
oh well that guy fights.

471
00:11:48,781 --> 00:11:49,390
Like this guy.

472
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:53,740
He kind of moves a little bit like him
or Tiago Alva as a sort of like that guy

473
00:11:53,741 --> 00:11:53,980
or you

474
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,071
know,

475
00:11:54,071 --> 00:11:55,150
you could kind of do that with,

476
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,050
with a lot of fighters.

477
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:56,951
But now with you,

478
00:11:56,951 --> 00:11:57,281
you got it.

479
00:11:57,281 --> 00:12:00,130
This weird sort of unusual timing,

480
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,090
you know,

481
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,680
especially that left leg man.

482
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:03,101
You're,

483
00:12:03,101 --> 00:12:07,270
you're like one of the best guys have
ever seen at that front left leg counter.

484
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,460
Like to the body when a
guy's throwing a punch.

485
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,150
And I think you get all that time
spending in Thailand that there was one of

486
00:12:13,151 --> 00:12:13,841
their main things.

487
00:12:13,841 --> 00:12:15,010
It was a telling me it's so hard,

488
00:12:15,011 --> 00:12:15,970
the block of the back leg,

489
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:16,541
um,

490
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:17,201
cause that lead leg,

491
00:12:17,201 --> 00:12:17,860
so light it,

492
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,000
and then a majority of the time,

493
00:12:19,001 --> 00:12:20,710
90% of the people who are throwing lakes,

494
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,090
so you've got that lead leg ready.

495
00:12:22,091 --> 00:12:22,924
But when next time,

496
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:23,970
the three that left,

497
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,610
um,

498
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:25,510
it's really hard the block.

499
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:27,160
So I've perfected that.

500
00:12:27,161 --> 00:12:28,210
Left on the underpads,

501
00:12:28,211 --> 00:12:31,090
I'm throwing that 70% of the time
and my right leg is my power leg,

502
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,220
my left legs might my counter.

503
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,740
So I'm throwing that more than anything.

504
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:36,080
And then,

505
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:36,913
uh,

506
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,510
I started off with a really strong right
leg and my left leg was okay and I just

507
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:43,570
worked at at work that it worked
at it to make it my main weapon.

508
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:47,920
And now I'm like a jab for boxer
like comes through McKesson weapon.

509
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:48,230
Yeah.

510
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:48,791
And then someone,

511
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,350
as soon as someone comes in to strike,

512
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:53,260
I throw that left leg and it's
not only am I trying to school,

513
00:12:53,261 --> 00:12:56,110
but I'm using it as a break to try and
stop you from throwing your combinations.

514
00:12:56,111 --> 00:12:56,740
Also,

515
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,011
if I,

516
00:12:57,011 --> 00:12:58,420
if I don't land on your ribs,

517
00:12:58,421 --> 00:12:59,151
I'm hitting your arms.

518
00:12:59,151 --> 00:13:01,150
So I'm pushing you off balance so
you can't throw the right hand.

519
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:03,310
Will I want to try and
break that right hand down.

520
00:13:03,311 --> 00:13:06,400
So that's taking the power away from your
right punch and you're putting weight

521
00:13:06,401 --> 00:13:07,060
into it too.

522
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,410
And landing with the Shin,

523
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:13,330
which also keeps the knee and
the thigh bone from you to them.

524
00:13:13,331 --> 00:13:14,290
It creates a space.

525
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:14,561
Yes.

526
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:15,850
And is a lot of power to it.

527
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,270
Yes.

528
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,010
If you use that so effectively,

529
00:13:18,011 --> 00:13:18,340
man.

530
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,520
And she should have used it more too
because in the after flight speech Cosmo's

531
00:13:21,521 --> 00:13:21,731
saying,

532
00:13:21,731 --> 00:13:21,941
oh,

533
00:13:21,941 --> 00:13:23,920
he was hurting me with
that left leg and then um,

534
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,001
to the body.

535
00:13:25,001 --> 00:13:25,280
Right.

536
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,440
He said that on the APP,

537
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,640
the flights and that's like,

538
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,290
ah,

539
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,123
dammit I should have,

540
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:31,000
I should have used it more.

541
00:13:31,001 --> 00:13:33,010
But there was a couple of
unique moments in that fight.

542
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,480
One of them was in the third round
when you just opened up with this crazy

543
00:13:37,481 --> 00:13:38,290
flurry.

544
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:38,620
Yes.

545
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,690
Like what was going on there?

546
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,440
You just have this feeling.

547
00:13:41,441 --> 00:13:42,940
Did you just just say,

548
00:13:42,941 --> 00:13:46,720
I'm just going to put a barrage on
this motherfucker and see what happens?

549
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:47,441
Yeah.

550
00:13:47,441 --> 00:13:48,470
My theory is if I,

551
00:13:48,471 --> 00:13:49,780
if I can get someone covering up,

552
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:51,243
I'm not going to stop them.

553
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:54,870
So if the opportunity comes in and if
I might take me 30 punches of my time,

554
00:13:54,871 --> 00:13:55,661
if 50 punches,

555
00:13:55,661 --> 00:13:58,930
but eventually I figure if I can find
that gap and I hit you hard enough,

556
00:13:58,931 --> 00:13:59,764
I know I can drop you.

557
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:03,690
So I was just trying my hardest to try
and land that big one to try and put him

558
00:14:03,691 --> 00:14:04,090
down.

559
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:08,500
And I knew that I've done enough work
in the gym to to throw all night and my

560
00:14:08,501 --> 00:14:09,430
gas tank was full.

561
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,690
There was no way I was going to guess.

562
00:14:10,691 --> 00:14:11,950
So I just kept throwing,

563
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:12,251
throwing,

564
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:12,541
throwing.

565
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:14,970
I think he'd come on and just lend
that good one to just give him,

566
00:14:14,971 --> 00:14:17,710
giving yourself an eight count
to get myself back into the game.

567
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:18,850
But um,

568
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:19,121
yeah,

569
00:14:19,121 --> 00:14:19,600
he,

570
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,090
I think he wore 30 ish and then,

571
00:14:22,091 --> 00:14:22,340
um,

572
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,190
he got here to the corner
and they shrugged it off.

573
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:24,460
I was like,

574
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,000
dammit,

575
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,833
now I'm screwed.

576
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:27,220
Well,

577
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:27,860
you know,

578
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,240
it's,

579
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,600
it's funny because you see a guy
blocking punches and covering up,

580
00:14:31,601 --> 00:14:32,410
but uh,

581
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,450
guys get knocked out
through gloves all the time.

582
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:34,811
Yes,

583
00:14:34,811 --> 00:14:35,330
yes,

584
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:35,650
yes.

585
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:36,401
Especially with kicks.

586
00:14:36,401 --> 00:14:36,730
Right.

587
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:37,370
And then it's,

588
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:38,203
uh,

589
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:40,990
I'm also trying to get into
your head as well to make you,

590
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:41,780
uh,

591
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,431
try and yeah.

592
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,150
Trying to,

593
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,340
trying to break you down
thing in disguise a machine.

594
00:14:45,341 --> 00:14:46,174
How can I stop him?

595
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,350
Um,

596
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:47,801
yeah,

597
00:14:47,801 --> 00:14:49,390
but unfortunately they didn't work.

598
00:14:49,391 --> 00:14:49,551
He,

599
00:14:49,551 --> 00:14:49,931
because my,

600
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:50,530
it was,

601
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:50,921
it was good.

602
00:14:50,921 --> 00:14:51,680
It's very good.

603
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,080
Yeah.

604
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,270
Is another unique moment.

605
00:14:53,271 --> 00:14:54,320
In the fourth round,

606
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:58,490
you rocked him with a right hand and then
he started like cleaning the bottom of

607
00:14:58,491 --> 00:14:59,070
his feet.

608
00:14:59,070 --> 00:14:59,900
Yes.

609
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,733
He was hurt.

610
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:01,701
He was hurt.

611
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:01,970
He was like,

612
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:02,101
oh,

613
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,300
that's something on my foot like this.

614
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,630
You just got rock first.

615
00:15:05,631 --> 00:15:10,340
First I thought he lost
his mouthpiece and then I,

616
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:10,550
as,

617
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,383
as I seen him sweat,

618
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:12,890
I've gone to John Payne and that,

619
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:13,261
Whoa,

620
00:15:13,261 --> 00:15:13,471
whoa,

621
00:15:13,471 --> 00:15:13,701
Whoa,

622
00:15:13,701 --> 00:15:14,060
whoa.

623
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,620
And then I thought he lost his contact.

624
00:15:15,621 --> 00:15:16,460
I don't know what was going on,

625
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,510
but it was a full like,

626
00:15:17,511 --> 00:15:17,631
no,

627
00:15:17,631 --> 00:15:17,781
no,

628
00:15:17,781 --> 00:15:18,050
no,

629
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:18,621
you're wrong.

630
00:15:18,621 --> 00:15:19,360
I'm right.

631
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,193
Just a second.

632
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:21,403
And then,

633
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:22,130
then it's like,

634
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:22,461
oh no,

635
00:15:22,461 --> 00:15:23,220
he was fucked.

636
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:23,960
I should,

637
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,920
I should've jumped on him.

638
00:15:24,921 --> 00:15:27,770
But he played a little mind gay.

639
00:15:27,771 --> 00:15:29,840
I was affecting gay move.

640
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:30,111
It's like,

641
00:15:30,111 --> 00:15:30,471
stumps up,

642
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:30,801
stumps up.

643
00:15:30,801 --> 00:15:30,951
Wait,

644
00:15:30,951 --> 00:15:31,101
wait,

645
00:15:31,101 --> 00:15:31,440
wait.

646
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,273
No,

647
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,223
I'm good.

648
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,350
Well there you guys match
up at opportunity and you
tried to move in and the

649
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:37,780
referee got away the room.

650
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,410
Very fucked up.

651
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,100
Yay.

652
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,450
He didn't know what was going on either.

653
00:15:41,451 --> 00:15:44,790
He got hustled as well
say to each credit he,

654
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:45,590
he pulled that movie.

655
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:45,801
Yeah.

656
00:15:45,801 --> 00:15:48,590
That could have been made in my
shot where you could tell too,

657
00:15:48,591 --> 00:15:50,210
because after that he wasn't the same.

658
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,610
And then in the fourth
round or the fifth round,

659
00:15:52,611 --> 00:15:53,001
rather,

660
00:15:53,001 --> 00:15:54,860
you came on strong in the fifth round.

661
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,970
Fifth round was all you.

662
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,060
I think you heard him
bad in that fourth round.

663
00:15:59,061 --> 00:16:00,050
I think you stung him.

664
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:00,900
That's what their,

665
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:04,910
that's the only reason why God would
ever do like a con move like that.

666
00:16:04,911 --> 00:16:05,031
Like,

667
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:05,541
hold on man,

668
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:06,620
I've got to clean the bottom of my feet.

669
00:16:06,621 --> 00:16:06,741
Like,

670
00:16:06,741 --> 00:16:08,240
hey fuck you talking about it.

671
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,100
You don't get to clean
the bottom of your feet.

672
00:16:10,101 --> 00:16:11,030
The guys stops

673
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,573
boxing.

674
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,690
It was very strange.

675
00:16:14,691 --> 00:16:15,021
And then,

676
00:16:15,021 --> 00:16:15,700
uh,

677
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:19,610
we were chatting afterwards and you came
into the change room and we had to have

678
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,960
a chat.

679
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,213
Um,

680
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:22,671
and then you guys,

681
00:16:22,671 --> 00:16:23,121
Oh man,

682
00:16:23,121 --> 00:16:23,811
you wouldn't believe it.

683
00:16:23,811 --> 00:16:28,040
The very last punch you through your
broke my nose and I kind of breathe.

684
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,680
So as I've gone into the
hospital to the emergency,

685
00:16:30,681 --> 00:16:34,040
he was in one of the other rooms getting
these knees put back into together so

686
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:37,700
you could see his nose leaking when he
was talking to pat Miletich his nose was

687
00:16:37,701 --> 00:16:38,450
leaking,

688
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:38,960
but uh,

689
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,090
he's a tough guy and
it seems like a really,

690
00:16:41,091 --> 00:16:42,140
really nice guy too.

691
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,180
We've fought each other three times now.

692
00:16:44,181 --> 00:16:46,850
And then we've also fought on
the same cards here in Jamaica,

693
00:16:46,851 --> 00:16:48,600
in Australia and a few other places in,

694
00:16:48,601 --> 00:16:48,950
um,

695
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:49,730
nicest bloke.

696
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,620
He's just the genuine.

697
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,730
And then even when we've,

698
00:16:52,731 --> 00:16:53,510
we,

699
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,050
we got,

700
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:54,560
uh,

701
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,980
put together for this fight would
message each other privately on Facebook.

702
00:16:57,981 --> 00:17:00,140
And I'm just talking
about different things.

703
00:17:00,141 --> 00:17:01,250
So there's no animosity.

704
00:17:01,251 --> 00:17:01,611
It's just,

705
00:17:01,611 --> 00:17:02,444
it's just business,

706
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:02,990
right?

707
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:03,801
He's got to get paid.

708
00:17:03,801 --> 00:17:04,521
I've got to get paid.

709
00:17:04,521 --> 00:17:04,641
We,

710
00:17:04,641 --> 00:17:05,790
we beat competition.

711
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:06,651
Competition.

712
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:06,981
We beat,

713
00:17:06,981 --> 00:17:07,820
we beat each other up.

714
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:09,290
And then at the end of it again,

715
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:10,520
we got on each other's change room.

716
00:17:10,521 --> 00:17:11,331
We high five.

717
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:11,811
Good fight.

718
00:17:11,811 --> 00:17:12,620
Thank you very much.

719
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,453
Um,

720
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,140
you know,

721
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,950
that's interesting because that's a,

722
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:20,570
that's a big part of fighting is
the comradery between fighters,

723
00:17:20,571 --> 00:17:25,010
but also a big part of fighting is the
mental game when there is no camaraderie,

724
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:27,200
when guys are fucking with each
other and it becomes emotional.

725
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:31,020
And there's a lot of fighters that
have been tripped up by emotions.

726
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:35,000
Like Donald Cerrone was on the podcast
and we were talking about his fight with

727
00:17:35,001 --> 00:17:35,241
date.

728
00:17:35,241 --> 00:17:38,810
Diaz and Nate Diaz talked to
all kinds of crazy shit to him,

729
00:17:38,811 --> 00:17:40,400
knocked his cowboy hat off,

730
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:40,860
you know,

731
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,010
call them every fucking name in the book.

732
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,360
And then when they fought,

733
00:17:44,361 --> 00:17:46,130
Donald was all fucked up emotionally.

734
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:51,000
He was so emotionally invested and beaten
guy's ass and not losing to this guy

735
00:17:51,001 --> 00:17:53,700
that he just couldn't perform at his best.

736
00:17:53,701 --> 00:17:53,970
He just,

737
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:55,470
he just was so tied up.

738
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,030
And Conor Mcgregor,

739
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,110
he does that to everybody.

740
00:17:58,111 --> 00:17:58,381
Yeah.

741
00:17:58,381 --> 00:17:59,820
He fucks with you so hard.

742
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:00,990
By the time you get in there,

743
00:18:00,991 --> 00:18:02,190
you don't even know who you are.

744
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,310
He's got you convinced you're
a totally different person.

745
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,840
You'll just want to kill him
and then you can't even hit him.

746
00:18:07,841 --> 00:18:08,360
And it's like,

747
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,180
it's such a,

748
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,690
it's such a mind fuck when
you wind up hating someone.

749
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:12,970
Yeah.

750
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:14,100
So in that sense,

751
00:18:14,101 --> 00:18:17,580
it's gotta be a pleasure when you
meet a gentleman like cosmo Alexander,

752
00:18:17,581 --> 00:18:18,900
who's a great fighter as well.

753
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:21,300
And you don't have to
think about all that jazz.

754
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:22,080
You can just,

755
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:22,950
just be yourself.

756
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:23,690
I,

757
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:25,230
I'm very lucky with this boy.

758
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,131
I haven't had any,

759
00:18:26,131 --> 00:18:26,430
uh,

760
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,263
quantum and Greg is,

761
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:27,840
oh,

762
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:27,931
I,

763
00:18:27,931 --> 00:18:30,840
Nick Diaz is in that of
ever and all your fights,

764
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:31,650
uh,

765
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:32,041
with those,

766
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:36,120
one time I was on a television show
called the contender as a French gentleman

767
00:18:36,121 --> 00:18:39,690
that was sort of getting under
everyone's skin and he was a token token,

768
00:18:39,691 --> 00:18:40,201
a lot of smack,

769
00:18:40,201 --> 00:18:40,910
but at the same time,

770
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:41,743
what was that guy's name?

771
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:42,743
Rafiq.

772
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,040
Rafiq him.

773
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,720
And then everyone was
coming up to me saying,

774
00:18:45,721 --> 00:18:46,441
you got to knock this plug,

775
00:18:46,441 --> 00:18:47,460
can't you go and look this book out?

776
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:50,530
And then even the field cream look come
and behind the scenes and oh you got all

777
00:18:50,531 --> 00:18:52,110
these book yet you got to
get this guy off the show.

778
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:54,150
Cause as soon as you add on as shy,

779
00:18:54,151 --> 00:18:54,721
as soon as you lost,

780
00:18:54,721 --> 00:18:55,554
you went home.

781
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:56,161
So,

782
00:18:56,161 --> 00:18:56,994
um,

783
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,780
I put a lot of pressure on myself to,

784
00:18:58,781 --> 00:18:59,850
and then again,

785
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,110
the hottie try knock somebody out,

786
00:19:01,111 --> 00:19:04,280
the less it happens and then the more
mentally draining you get to cause why is

787
00:19:04,281 --> 00:19:04,430
that?

788
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,370
Why haven't knocked him out yet?

789
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,511
Instead of thinking,

790
00:19:06,511 --> 00:19:06,721
okay,

791
00:19:06,721 --> 00:19:07,471
just do the business.

792
00:19:07,471 --> 00:19:09,090
And then if something
lands then it goes down.

793
00:19:09,091 --> 00:19:10,410
But when the harder you try,

794
00:19:10,411 --> 00:19:11,191
the less it happens,

795
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,420
then the more frustrated you get,

796
00:19:12,421 --> 00:19:14,700
then the more tired you get
because you're mentally drained.

797
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,080
So yeah,

798
00:19:16,081 --> 00:19:17,640
it's a tough gig that it's,

799
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,240
that's,

800
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,710
it's that way with everything man.

801
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,790
It's that way with everything.

802
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:24,150
As soon as you get emotionally invested
in something like that and just you're

803
00:19:24,151 --> 00:19:25,710
dealing with that other thing,

804
00:19:25,711 --> 00:19:28,290
which is even bigger and
more central to your,

805
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,124
your thoughts,

806
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,170
then your actual task at hand,

807
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:31,831
you're dealing with this,

808
00:19:31,831 --> 00:19:33,330
like this talk,

809
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:33,961
jazz,

810
00:19:33,961 --> 00:19:34,231
blah,

811
00:19:34,231 --> 00:19:34,441
blah,

812
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:34,680
blah.

813
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,030
Which is you're going to fight.

814
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:36,451
I mean,

815
00:19:36,451 --> 00:19:36,850
you're going to,

816
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:40,650
you're going to engage in the most
intense form of competition ever,

817
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:44,220
and you're concentrating on this
bullshit like talking bullshit.

818
00:19:44,221 --> 00:19:45,480
Like what difference does it make?

819
00:19:45,481 --> 00:19:46,830
What we say if we're going to fight?

820
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:47,161
Well,

821
00:19:47,161 --> 00:19:49,770
the difference is if you can
fuck with the guys emotions,

822
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:50,401
he can't fight.

823
00:19:50,401 --> 00:19:51,000
Good.

824
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,833
It's crazy.

825
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,673
Um,

826
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,633
uh,

827
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,820
on the wane with Cosmo,

828
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:56,823
uh,

829
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,690
at the airport I bought myself a,

830
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,900
a little boomerangs,

831
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,200
sue a souvenir,

832
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,890
and then I presented at the
cosmo at the Wayne and then,

833
00:20:03,891 --> 00:20:04,070
um,

834
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:04,330
we,

835
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:07,320
we hugged and shook hands and
took a photo with the boomerang.

836
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,690
And it was just that a gentleman gesture.

837
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:09,961
It's like,

838
00:20:09,961 --> 00:20:10,111
oh,

839
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,570
well they sure ain't gonna remember me.

840
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,690
And then,

841
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,750
but then you look at the
UFC and then they get the,

842
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,820
that Dana white standing in the middle
and the Holden guys met this guy,

843
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:18,660
well,

844
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,180
24 hours time that you're going to
punch each other in the face anyway.

845
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,520
So what boy,

846
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,930
what will the wireless acting?

847
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:27,000
And then same with them.

848
00:20:27,001 --> 00:20:28,130
Conor McGregor and Eldorado,

849
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,490
every time they get together it's like,

850
00:20:29,491 --> 00:20:32,370
well you technically you can't really do
it and now you're both going to get in

851
00:20:32,371 --> 00:20:34,230
a lot of trouble or
you're going to get fine.

852
00:20:34,231 --> 00:20:39,170
But either the commission or
Dana or UFC or so just kind of,

853
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:39,660
you just be,

854
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,740
I know it sells tickets to,

855
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:41,620
I know it's in a test.

856
00:20:41,621 --> 00:20:41,801
It's,

857
00:20:41,801 --> 00:20:42,100
it's,

858
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:42,841
it's riveting.

859
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:43,740
It's so you can't,

860
00:20:43,741 --> 00:20:44,820
you can't not watch it.

861
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:47,040
You can't not train into
the websites and the,

862
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:48,190
and the replays.

863
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,023
But uh,

864
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:49,481
yes,

865
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:52,780
but he's been a gentleman sometimes
can be boring compared to complete.

866
00:20:52,781 --> 00:20:53,620
When you look at it like that,

867
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,640
it's kind of a catch 22 right.

868
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:55,960
It's like,

869
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,450
cause you can make a lot of
money by being an Asshole,

870
00:20:59,110 --> 00:20:59,500
right?

871
00:20:59,500 --> 00:20:59,831
I mean,

872
00:20:59,831 --> 00:21:00,190
God,

873
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:01,630
people pay attention to you.

874
00:21:01,631 --> 00:21:01,901
It'd be,

875
00:21:01,901 --> 00:21:02,621
it becomes,

876
00:21:02,621 --> 00:21:03,270
is,

877
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:05,320
is huge media selling point.

878
00:21:05,321 --> 00:21:05,651
It's a,

879
00:21:05,651 --> 00:21:07,240
the story and look,

880
00:21:07,241 --> 00:21:08,021
the Jon Jones,

881
00:21:08,021 --> 00:21:09,070
Daniel Cormier fight,

882
00:21:09,071 --> 00:21:09,850
I think,

883
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:13,270
I do believe that Jon Jones is the
best light heavyweight on the planet.

884
00:21:13,271 --> 00:21:16,810
And I think he beat Daniel Cormier
because he's incredibly skillful.

885
00:21:16,811 --> 00:21:18,070
And because he's just so good.

886
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,260
But I also believe that Daniel Cormier,

887
00:21:20,261 --> 00:21:24,610
Aa was fucked up going into that fight
emotionally because John had talked so

888
00:21:24,611 --> 00:21:25,600
much shit to him.

889
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,990
They got in a fight at the weigh ins
where they like literally we're throwing

890
00:21:28,991 --> 00:21:31,660
punches at each other and
they had to be separated.

891
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,620
It was a giant bro.

892
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:33,311
It wasn't a Wayans.

893
00:21:33,311 --> 00:21:34,780
Rather it was a truck conference,

894
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,250
giant brawl,

895
00:21:36,251 --> 00:21:38,680
the press conference knocking people over,

896
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,060
throwing shoes at each other.

897
00:21:40,061 --> 00:21:40,990
He was madness.

898
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,500
But John can handle that
stuff better than Daniel.

899
00:21:44,501 --> 00:21:45,100
Ken.

900
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:49,840
John can still perform at the same
level and under those circumstances,

901
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:50,980
I don't think Daniel did.

902
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:51,960
Yep.

903
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,210
Yep.

904
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:52,460
Yeah.

905
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:52,661
No,

906
00:21:52,661 --> 00:21:52,961
that was,

907
00:21:52,961 --> 00:21:53,260
um,

908
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:53,951
that was insane.

909
00:21:53,951 --> 00:21:54,784
It was great.

910
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:55,803
That was crazy.

911
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:56,081
Well,

912
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:57,460
let's just Connor too.

913
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:58,300
I mean,

914
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,180
part of what Connor's doing
is fucking with people.

915
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:01,390
That's what Muhammad Ali,

916
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:05,410
Muhammad Ali did to Sonny Liston and
Muhammad Ali first fought Sonny Liston.

917
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,100
They,

918
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:10,780
he was screaming and yelling at him so
bad at the ins that they weren't going to

919
00:22:10,781 --> 00:22:11,614
let them fight,

920
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:15,100
that they thought there was something
wrong with him because his heart rate was

921
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:18,400
so crazy and his blood
pressure was so high.

922
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:21,610
They were worried that like
this guy is not fit to fight.

923
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:23,110
And then he calmed down.

924
00:22:23,111 --> 00:22:23,321
He's like,

925
00:22:23,321 --> 00:22:24,071
just relax when I was,

926
00:22:24,071 --> 00:22:24,431
go ahead.

927
00:22:24,431 --> 00:22:24,670
I'm,

928
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:24,981
I know what,

929
00:22:24,981 --> 00:22:26,080
no fuck no what I'm doing.

930
00:22:26,081 --> 00:22:27,070
I'm just fucking with this dude.

931
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:31,900
And it turned out that he
knew that Sonny Liston,

932
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:36,930
although he's terrifying and he's just
this massive hard puncher and knocked

933
00:22:37,571 --> 00:22:38,560
everybody dead.

934
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,360
He was scared of crazy people.

935
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:40,680
Yeah.

936
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,260
Yeah.

937
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,760
And that's what Muhammad Ali did.

938
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,380
He just act like a fucking crazy person.

939
00:22:44,381 --> 00:22:45,610
He used to drive to Sonny Liston,

940
00:22:45,611 --> 00:22:46,444
his house.

941
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:51,010
He would park his car on Sonny Liston
lawn and yell out at him in the middle of

942
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:51,011
the night.

943
00:22:51,011 --> 00:22:51,860
Just yell at them.

944
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,170
Really?

945
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:52,441
Get up,

946
00:22:52,441 --> 00:22:53,050
Sonny,

947
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:54,580
I'm going to kick your fucking ass.

948
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:55,090
Sonny.

949
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,470
He would say all kinds of crazy shit,

950
00:22:56,471 --> 00:22:57,580
son and this and you ain't shit.

951
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:57,970
Yeah,

952
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:58,571
Sonny Liston.

953
00:22:58,571 --> 00:22:59,404
I'm the man.

954
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,333
I'm the champ.

955
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,233
The champ is here.

956
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,580
It would say all kinds of
crazy shit on the lawn.

957
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:05,070
Like on his fucking long.

958
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,100
When I was trying to sleep,

959
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:07,570
he's doing them.

960
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,410
Uh,

961
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:11,170
Shannon Briggs to get well
with Shannon brings does now.

962
00:23:11,171 --> 00:23:11,740
Yeah.

963
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:15,000
She had a Briggs hilarious
doesn't mean that's champ.

964
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,850
Then you pay pay attention
to his Instagram.

965
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:19,871
It's amazing.

966
00:23:19,871 --> 00:23:20,680
I was real well,

967
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,880
but then that's on loop is
pretty much every single beauty,

968
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,000
which is exactly the same.

969
00:23:25,001 --> 00:23:26,680
Whereas I actually had
a bit of class about it.

970
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:27,130
Oh Sam.

971
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:28,330
It was called icon is a Virginia says,

972
00:23:28,331 --> 00:23:28,570
well,

973
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:29,140
Oh yeah,

974
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:29,681
the breakout,

975
00:23:29,681 --> 00:23:30,221
the ramp pain.

976
00:23:30,221 --> 00:23:30,580
He's like,

977
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,180
that's um,

978
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,260
that's code that,

979
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,160
that was pretty cool.

980
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:33,641
Yeah.

981
00:23:33,641 --> 00:23:37,920
Break out the red repairs if you
fight the me breakout panties.

982
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:38,530
Honey,

983
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:39,363
we haven't made it.

984
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:40,600
No,

985
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,021
he's here.

986
00:23:41,021 --> 00:23:41,831
He's a genius.

987
00:23:41,831 --> 00:23:44,590
Connor is the best shit talker ever had.

988
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:47,930
He was thinking that you're laying in
bed lane and you peel anything and you

989
00:23:47,931 --> 00:23:48,440
know what?

990
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:48,801
Yeah,

991
00:23:48,801 --> 00:23:52,610
what color panties through my
missus wave when the red ones,

992
00:23:52,611 --> 00:23:54,140
the red ones are probably the best ones.

993
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:55,360
I don't even think he's thinking.

994
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,630
I think that's just him.

995
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,560
I think he just,

996
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:58,850
he just free and just,

997
00:23:59,100 --> 00:23:59,933
just thinks,

998
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,100
just thinks that way.

999
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:01,670
You know,

1000
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:03,260
he's just amazing shit talker.

1001
00:24:03,261 --> 00:24:04,130
He's so good at it.

1002
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:04,581
Yeah.

1003
00:24:04,581 --> 00:24:04,930
I took,

1004
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:05,210
um,

1005
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,800
I took the hands of a bit between,

1006
00:24:06,801 --> 00:24:07,250
um,

1007
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,590
the last couple of days and he
reckons he's such a good guy here.

1008
00:24:09,591 --> 00:24:11,830
Has Mauling camp handset.

1009
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:12,290
Um,

1010
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:13,370
when you talked to him one on one,

1011
00:24:13,371 --> 00:24:17,240
he said he's just the nicest
politest gentlemen you'll ever meet.

1012
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,980
And then you're putting
in front of a stage,

1013
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:21,590
especially in front of those crowds
that they're pulling up the Wayne's and

1014
00:24:21,591 --> 00:24:22,424
press conferences.

1015
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,330
And then he just,

1016
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:25,610
he just shines and just come,

1017
00:24:25,611 --> 00:24:26,810
becomes as different animal,

1018
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,780
which is a marketing geniuses
at the same time too.

1019
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,280
They're just a brilliant entrepreneur.

1020
00:24:31,281 --> 00:24:32,720
There's going to be set up for life.

1021
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:35,450
And he wasn't like that
earlier in his career,

1022
00:24:35,451 --> 00:24:35,630
you know,

1023
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:38,180
he became like that really
when he got to the UFC.

1024
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:38,601
I mean,

1025
00:24:38,601 --> 00:24:39,041
he had a,

1026
00:24:39,041 --> 00:24:39,270
uh,

1027
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:39,440
a,

1028
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,060
a hair of that before.

1029
00:24:41,061 --> 00:24:44,120
He had a little bit of that before
where he was confident and he would talk

1030
00:24:44,121 --> 00:24:44,601
well.

1031
00:24:44,601 --> 00:24:47,300
And I've been following Connor for years.

1032
00:24:47,301 --> 00:24:49,400
I tweeted him a long time ago,

1033
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:51,560
like a several years ago,

1034
00:24:51,561 --> 00:24:54,110
back when he was a fighting in England,

1035
00:24:54,111 --> 00:24:54,944
I believe it was,

1036
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:55,933
I think it was England.

1037
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:56,870
I'm not sure,

1038
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,580
fighting and some overseas organization.

1039
00:24:58,581 --> 00:25:01,850
And I watched him on
youtube and I was like,

1040
00:25:01,851 --> 00:25:03,050
this guy's fucking talented.

1041
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:04,130
He's talented.

1042
00:25:04,131 --> 00:25:06,740
He's got a clean left hand to his,

1043
00:25:06,741 --> 00:25:07,070
uh,

1044
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:07,371
his,

1045
00:25:07,371 --> 00:25:08,640
his left hand power punch.

1046
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,440
Oof.

1047
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,820
That's a fucking good night Irene.

1048
00:25:10,821 --> 00:25:12,230
Punch man from this apple.

1049
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:12,741
Yeah.

1050
00:25:12,741 --> 00:25:12,931
He,

1051
00:25:12,931 --> 00:25:13,341
he,

1052
00:25:13,341 --> 00:25:15,410
he's so good at measuring guys too.

1053
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,770
Very good at measuring and he
has a very offspeed movement.

1054
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,510
His movement is unusual.

1055
00:25:20,511 --> 00:25:21,800
Very difficult to Tom.

1056
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:25,970
I just want the things I was thinking
about when I was watching you find unusual

1057
00:25:25,971 --> 00:25:26,780
movement.

1058
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:27,081
You know,

1059
00:25:27,081 --> 00:25:27,291
it's,

1060
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:27,561
it's,

1061
00:25:27,561 --> 00:25:28,040
uh,

1062
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:28,641
very,

1063
00:25:28,641 --> 00:25:29,060
um,

1064
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,980
very difficult thing
for guys to deal with.

1065
00:25:30,981 --> 00:25:33,140
Like a lot of fighters will tell you that,

1066
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:33,560
um,

1067
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:37,550
sparring with a person who has a
very traditional style is almost like

1068
00:25:37,551 --> 00:25:38,630
comforting sometimes.

1069
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,630
But we spar with a guy who
might not even be a skillful,

1070
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,660
but it's doing things all
wrong but has a lot of power.

1071
00:25:44,661 --> 00:25:45,670
Like does things like real,

1072
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:46,850
like,

1073
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:47,600
um,

1074
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,310
the guy who just fought sugar,

1075
00:25:49,311 --> 00:25:53,210
Shane Mosley that crazy guy who smoked
cigarettes from like a wrong yoga.

1076
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:53,781
Yeah.

1077
00:25:53,781 --> 00:25:54,614
Ricardo [inaudible].

1078
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,191
Ricardo,

1079
00:25:55,191 --> 00:25:56,660
my org is a perfect example.

1080
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,673
When he used to fight,

1081
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:57,901
uh,

1082
00:25:57,901 --> 00:25:59,480
the late great virgin forest,

1083
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,080
he beat that dude because
forest couldn't deal with his,

1084
00:26:02,081 --> 00:26:02,510
his,

1085
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:03,231
his weird,

1086
00:26:03,231 --> 00:26:05,600
crazy punches coming from everywhere.

1087
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:06,441
It was madness.

1088
00:26:06,441 --> 00:26:10,910
Let's punches were coming from like behind
his calf and over the top and hit you

1089
00:26:10,911 --> 00:26:11,601
on the nose.

1090
00:26:11,601 --> 00:26:12,860
Like what the fuck?

1091
00:26:12,861 --> 00:26:16,760
Like everything was winking and
wild and with murderous intentions,

1092
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,320
it was so street,

1093
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,010
you know,

1094
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:19,701
everything it was,

1095
00:26:19,701 --> 00:26:21,010
it was not like skillful,

1096
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:26,020
was not like fighting like a Roberto
Duran who was like incredibly skillful,

1097
00:26:26,061 --> 00:26:27,890
but also like raw too.

1098
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,610
You know,

1099
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:29,331
with Ricardo,

1100
00:26:29,331 --> 00:26:29,751
my organ,

1101
00:26:29,751 --> 00:26:30,710
everything was awkward.

1102
00:26:30,711 --> 00:26:31,940
It's like you didn't know what the fuck.

1103
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:33,470
You couldn't get into this rhythm.

1104
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:36,350
Like when she like to very
skillful boxers fight,

1105
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:36,921
you know,

1106
00:26:36,921 --> 00:26:37,201
you,

1107
00:26:37,201 --> 00:26:38,000
you see,

1108
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,110
they're looking for openings.

1109
00:26:39,111 --> 00:26:39,944
They're probing,

1110
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:44,250
but you see like of of a
common rhythm or a rhythm that

1111
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:45,840
you've seen before,

1112
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:46,763
you know,

1113
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:50,120
it's a conventional way of
moving that same in Bangkok,

1114
00:26:50,121 --> 00:26:52,440
you watch two professional
ties in their training.

1115
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,333
Identical.

1116
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,550
So when you put them against each other
and now you're watching the chess game

1117
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:57,620
and then,

1118
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,040
uh,

1119
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:58,900
well back in the 90s,

1120
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,251
anyway,

1121
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:01,770
then you chuck in your
Raymond Deco's or more.

1122
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,790
Luckily for myself,

1123
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:03,361
um,

1124
00:27:03,361 --> 00:27:04,190
you throwing that,

1125
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,450
that the hands because they
weren't really boxing back then.

1126
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:06,991
Right.

1127
00:27:06,991 --> 00:27:09,450
And all of a sudden you're thrown
out the rhythm because they're not,

1128
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,620
they're all of a sudden they're like,

1129
00:27:10,621 --> 00:27:11,730
what the hell's going on here?

1130
00:27:11,731 --> 00:27:12,480
Yeah.

1131
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:12,601
Yeah.

1132
00:27:12,601 --> 00:27:15,390
Ramon Dekkers used to do everything hard.

1133
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:16,560
Everything hard.

1134
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,030
Every fucking punch was murder.

1135
00:27:18,031 --> 00:27:19,170
Every kick was murder.

1136
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:19,610
Yes.

1137
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:19,920
And,

1138
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,730
but see,

1139
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:25,730
the difference between you and him was
that you've fought smart enough to get to

1140
00:27:25,891 --> 00:27:29,220
39 years old and still
confined world title fights.

1141
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:29,580
Yes.

1142
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,310
Whereas by the time he
was in his late thirties,

1143
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,330
his body had just been destroyed.

1144
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,010
He destroyed his ankles.

1145
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,370
Like they say that by the time
he had his last few fights,

1146
00:27:38,371 --> 00:27:41,400
like his ankles were so bad
that his doctors told him,

1147
00:27:41,401 --> 00:27:42,660
if you break your ankle again,

1148
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:44,400
we might have to amputate your foot.

1149
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:44,681
Yeah.

1150
00:27:44,681 --> 00:27:44,901
Yeah.

1151
00:27:44,901 --> 00:27:46,590
And so he switched his stance.

1152
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:48,030
He started kicking him with his other leg,

1153
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:50,670
but then the fight was to get
heated up and he'd go fuck it.

1154
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:55,350
And he would go right back and throw
that same kick over and over again.

1155
00:27:55,351 --> 00:27:56,760
Just slamming the guy's arms,

1156
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:59,130
slamming her knee slammed or their shin.

1157
00:27:59,280 --> 00:27:59,491
Yeah,

1158
00:27:59,491 --> 00:28:00,510
he's the guy and he's a king.

1159
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:01,620
I said that last time too.

1160
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:02,580
He's still looking.

1161
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:02,941
I still,

1162
00:28:02,941 --> 00:28:04,750
I still think it was amazing man.

1163
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:05,140
The Pan,

1164
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:05,973
the greatest ever.

1165
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:06,781
He was the man.

1166
00:28:06,781 --> 00:28:06,940
He,

1167
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,850
he's someone I'm trying
to implement and still,

1168
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:09,870
and I said that last time too.

1169
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,713
And Yeah.

1170
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:11,660
Um,

1171
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,030
yeah,

1172
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:12,863
my whole,

1173
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,010
every single,

1174
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,210
every single time I have a fight,

1175
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,530
I'm trying to emulate,

1176
00:28:16,531 --> 00:28:19,980
trying to walk in his footsteps
to become the next team.

1177
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:20,970
Say now how,

1178
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:24,420
how have you gotten to
39 years of age though?

1179
00:28:24,421 --> 00:28:26,340
I mean with all your
cuts and all that stuff,

1180
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:30,060
but you don't have any injuries that
have stopped you from competing at the

1181
00:28:30,061 --> 00:28:31,110
world class level?

1182
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:31,650
Uh,

1183
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:32,300
just,

1184
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:32,630
uh,

1185
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:33,180
luck.

1186
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:33,660
Uh,

1187
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:36,330
I've been so fortunate
to have good genetics.

1188
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:36,900
Um,

1189
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,540
and I still had the passion.

1190
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:40,320
I still wake up every morning at five 30.

1191
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:40,650
I'm,

1192
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:42,030
I'm on the road at six 30.

1193
00:28:42,031 --> 00:28:43,410
I'm still running 12 ks.

1194
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,520
Uh,

1195
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,230
I'm still hitting the pads just as hard.

1196
00:28:46,231 --> 00:28:47,970
I'm still doing messy rounds.

1197
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:48,531
I had to,

1198
00:28:48,531 --> 00:28:49,680
for this last pip would,

1199
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,230
I was running a hundred kilometers a week.

1200
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:53,160
I ran for 10 weeks.

1201
00:28:53,161 --> 00:28:53,710
I worked at,

1202
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:55,740
I ran a thousand kilometers for this camp.

1203
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,550
So that's morning and night altogether.

1204
00:28:58,870 --> 00:28:59,670
American,

1205
00:28:59,670 --> 00:28:59,940
uh,

1206
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,750
600 miles,

1207
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,583
600 miles,

1208
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,380
600 miles for the tea and
the tea every 10 weeks.

1209
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,640
That's a lot of fucking miles.

1210
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:06,811
Nine rounds.

1211
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:07,231
And the peds,

1212
00:29:07,231 --> 00:29:07,921
it sounds better.

1213
00:29:07,921 --> 00:29:08,820
When you say a thousand though,

1214
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:12,390
it sounds Colombia I should go to meet is,

1215
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:14,893
um,

1216
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:15,933
uh,

1217
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,370
nine rounds in the pads.

1218
00:29:17,371 --> 00:29:19,290
I was to boxing five tied,

1219
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,281
two or three legs,

1220
00:29:20,281 --> 00:29:21,114
shields.

1221
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:23,520
And then I'm still running
with the young kids.

1222
00:29:23,521 --> 00:29:25,260
I'm still spinning the
young guys in Australia.

1223
00:29:25,261 --> 00:29:27,690
I've got a couple of young gentleman's
at Jake Lynn and Elliot calmed them to

1224
00:29:27,691 --> 00:29:28,800
come to the gym on Saturdays.

1225
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:29,610
Um,

1226
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:31,080
they're in their early twenties.

1227
00:29:31,081 --> 00:29:34,410
I'm still holding my with them and
then they let the best projects.

1228
00:29:34,411 --> 00:29:36,690
Australia has an m and m I'm not losing.

1229
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:39,480
So you think the dust
because of your passion,

1230
00:29:39,481 --> 00:29:43,360
do you think that's because
of your enthusiasm that
you truly love morning time

1231
00:29:43,361 --> 00:29:44,230
and I know you do.

1232
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,250
I mean it's up to you.

1233
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:46,084
It's just like,

1234
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,600
it's so exciting and
invigorating and fulfilling.

1235
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:52,840
And do you think that that's
what happens to fighters?

1236
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:53,800
Um,

1237
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,850
first the,

1238
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:58,510
the waning enthusiasm even
before the body starts to fail.

1239
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,320
Uh,

1240
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,160
I'm not sure.

1241
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:00,820
My,

1242
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:01,090
I,

1243
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,010
because I've had other
students that have of,

1244
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,300
cause I run the gym off.

1245
00:30:04,301 --> 00:30:05,470
I'd go as it had 30,

1246
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:06,101
40 flights,

1247
00:30:06,101 --> 00:30:06,940
said a world beaters,

1248
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:10,840
but the shoulder pops with an egos or
their ankles goes and then it's not,

1249
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,740
they have to retire.

1250
00:30:11,741 --> 00:30:12,310
It's not a,

1251
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,450
not a case of that one too.

1252
00:30:13,451 --> 00:30:16,660
They have to where I've been so
fortunate that my knees are in tech,

1253
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:17,890
my shoulders are good.

1254
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:18,380
My,

1255
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:18,910
my,

1256
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:20,080
I've had a few poems in my hands,

1257
00:30:20,081 --> 00:30:20,311
but no,

1258
00:30:20,311 --> 00:30:21,670
nothing really to stop me.

1259
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:22,923
Um,

1260
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:23,450
um,

1261
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:24,730
surgeries of your hands at all?

1262
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:24,911
Nine.

1263
00:30:24,911 --> 00:30:25,120
Nothing.

1264
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:25,953
Honestly,

1265
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,161
I've just had stitches,

1266
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:29,650
just lots of no surgeries at lots
and lots and lots of stitches.

1267
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:30,820
But um,

1268
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:31,490
besides that,

1269
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:32,141
uh,

1270
00:30:32,141 --> 00:30:32,650
I'm,

1271
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:35,200
I'm just so blessed that I'm gay.

1272
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:39,910
And then besides good genetics
and the passion that's,

1273
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:40,300
um,

1274
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:40,571
I just,

1275
00:30:40,571 --> 00:30:41,360
I just want to,

1276
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,780
my life from the time
I was four years old,

1277
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,070
all I want him to be as a martial artist
and now I'm getting older and I know

1278
00:30:48,071 --> 00:30:50,500
that my time is coming
and I don't want to stop.

1279
00:30:50,501 --> 00:30:51,221
I want to ride the,

1280
00:30:51,221 --> 00:30:53,540
ride the wave all the way until I pass.

1281
00:30:53,541 --> 00:30:54,341
But I know I can't,

1282
00:30:54,341 --> 00:30:55,174
but I want to,

1283
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,620
if I had my way,

1284
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,990
I'd fight to the very day
that I go to my grave.

1285
00:30:59,080 --> 00:30:59,441
Do you,

1286
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:02,530
are you more careful now
that you're 39 years old,

1287
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,990
you more careful now about your diet,

1288
00:31:04,991 --> 00:31:06,570
about rehabilitation,

1289
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,960
about those kinds of things?

1290
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,220
I'm more more aware about
losing weight before a flight.

1291
00:31:12,221 --> 00:31:13,510
Before I was trying to do at toy away.

1292
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:14,980
I was trying to lose 10 kilos in three,

1293
00:31:14,981 --> 00:31:17,560
four days and now I'm doing
it over a 10 week period.

1294
00:31:17,561 --> 00:31:19,720
So I'm only losing those last few kilos.

1295
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,560
And the two days prior to the awake,

1296
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:22,600
the Wayne,

1297
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:26,350
do you think that though when you finding
a really big guy like cosmo Xander who

1298
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,380
most likely lost a shitload of water,

1299
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,460
water weight the day before
the fight and then I ve um,

1300
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:37,550
re rehydrated which is legal in
Moitai still not legal in MMA anymore.

1301
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:38,560
Um,

1302
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,490
at least in the UFC.

1303
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,260
Do you think that that is,

1304
00:31:41,261 --> 00:31:41,700
uh,

1305
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:41,890
that,

1306
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:43,990
that it's a detriment to you though?

1307
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:44,650
This one,

1308
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:46,000
I went up a weight division also.

1309
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:46,741
I usually,

1310
00:31:46,741 --> 00:31:50,590
if I middle what was still the boxing
one 60 middle and seeing what's in the

1311
00:31:50,591 --> 00:31:51,310
books and weight divisions.

1312
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,510
And this was one 68,

1313
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:53,530
67,

1314
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:54,363
67,

1315
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,960
because I was flying to America.

1316
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:57,940
I didn't want to stab myself on the plane.

1317
00:31:57,941 --> 00:32:00,400
I didn't want to get here and I didn't
want to have to put the sweatsuit on and

1318
00:32:00,401 --> 00:32:01,240
I didn't want a sauna,

1319
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:05,530
so I only had to lose a s two kilos,

1320
00:32:05,531 --> 00:32:06,364
six pounds.

1321
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:08,290
So there's nothing he say.

1322
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:08,741
And then,

1323
00:32:08,741 --> 00:32:09,574
um,

1324
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,990
and then come with come,

1325
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,730
come way and tell I felt comfortable,

1326
00:32:12,731 --> 00:32:14,740
but then come fight time
there for size differences.

1327
00:32:14,741 --> 00:32:15,650
Like oh my God,

1328
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:16,391
it was different.

1329
00:32:16,391 --> 00:32:19,570
But it's interesting that know the one
who was coming on in the fourth and fifth

1330
00:32:19,571 --> 00:32:19,991
round.

1331
00:32:19,991 --> 00:32:20,351
You know,

1332
00:32:20,351 --> 00:32:20,770
I mean,

1333
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:21,021
I,

1334
00:32:21,021 --> 00:32:21,610
I,

1335
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:21,850
I,

1336
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:22,490
I wanted it.

1337
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:23,323
So I,

1338
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:23,650
I,

1339
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,483
this is the,

1340
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,720
I can't remember how long it's been
since I've one of the world's huddles so

1341
00:32:28,721 --> 00:32:29,020
bad.

1342
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,730
I've been very fortunate enough to win 10,

1343
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,580
but I wanted this one because like,

1344
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,570
like I was saying last time I was here,

1345
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:35,650
um,

1346
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:37,240
I want to try and reach,

1347
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:39,980
I've been lucky enough
to be famous in Australia

1348
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,380
and be famous and Thailand
and made my name in Japan.

1349
00:32:42,381 --> 00:32:46,910
But America is like the last friend here
where we're at or haven't really sort

1350
00:32:46,911 --> 00:32:47,671
of excelled or,

1351
00:32:47,671 --> 00:32:49,400
or I want to,

1352
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:52,100
I wanted that title to say America.

1353
00:32:52,101 --> 00:32:52,200
He,

1354
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,033
this is me.

1355
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:53,661
And then,

1356
00:32:53,661 --> 00:32:54,080
um,

1357
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:54,790
and then I lost him.

1358
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:54,950
Like,

1359
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:55,390
ah,

1360
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,200
but I hope I put an
entertaining fight enough.

1361
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:58,973
Definitely did.

1362
00:32:59,060 --> 00:32:59,540
How many,

1363
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,620
how many titles does a lion fight have?

1364
00:33:01,621 --> 00:33:02,454
How many divisions?

1365
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:03,340
Uh,

1366
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:03,560
they ever,

1367
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,150
one 61 60.

1368
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:05,450
Yes.

1369
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,460
I believe you had single
Gloria holds it may.

1370
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,130
Oh No.

1371
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:10,610
Was it other young Thai
kid that I forgot his what?

1372
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,410
Possibly I think.

1373
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,341
I think that's,

1374
00:33:13,341 --> 00:33:13,870
yes,

1375
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:14,180
he's,

1376
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:14,361
well,

1377
00:33:14,361 --> 00:33:16,310
he's one of the stars in lion fight.

1378
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:16,581
Well,

1379
00:33:16,581 --> 00:33:16,911
I think,

1380
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:21,530
I personally think the lion fight has
some of the best skilled kick boxers in

1381
00:33:21,531 --> 00:33:22,350
the world today.

1382
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:22,760
Yeah.

1383
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,760
I really enjoy watching those
shows mean especially they'll,

1384
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:28,520
they'll bring in some ties
that are just murderous.

1385
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:29,490
They,

1386
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:29,810
they,

1387
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:31,670
they'll level of mortar that they show.

1388
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:36,920
You get to see this beautiful execution
of the style Purina that just fought on

1389
00:33:37,951 --> 00:33:38,111
this.

1390
00:33:38,111 --> 00:33:39,920
Any mains from Holland.

1391
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:40,641
She's amazing.

1392
00:33:40,641 --> 00:33:41,031
She was,

1393
00:33:41,031 --> 00:33:42,350
and then her fight,

1394
00:33:42,351 --> 00:33:43,184
we're against sidewalk.

1395
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:45,590
I did not hear about her
until she fought Cyborg.

1396
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,530
And then I was really intrigued to
see how cyborg would fight against it.

1397
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,730
My pure Moitai rules.

1398
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:50,460
And then,

1399
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:50,980
um,

1400
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,220
the Dutch girl came and said,

1401
00:33:52,221 --> 00:33:53,054
who is this?

1402
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:53,601
And then it's like,

1403
00:33:53,601 --> 00:33:54,434
Whoa,

1404
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,273
she's a base.

1405
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:58,070
There's the difference of pure
and Moitai against pure MMA.

1406
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:58,963
It was just,

1407
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:01,070
it was a beautiful to
watch the jewelry in a bar.

1408
00:34:01,071 --> 00:34:04,220
She has her name and she's tall and long.

1409
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:04,671
You know,

1410
00:34:04,671 --> 00:34:07,300
Dutch people are amongst
some of the tallest European,

1411
00:34:07,301 --> 00:34:11,060
say the average height is six feet
tall and they're very big people,

1412
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:11,691
you know.

1413
00:34:11,691 --> 00:34:12,524
And um,

1414
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,730
your arena is like probably one of the
most technical women in the world when it

1415
00:34:16,731 --> 00:34:19,820
comes to Moitai and that you got to
see that in that fight with Cyborg.

1416
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:20,001
And when,

1417
00:34:20,001 --> 00:34:20,661
when she pushed,

1418
00:34:20,661 --> 00:34:22,700
kicked her in the face
and knocked her down.

1419
00:34:22,701 --> 00:34:22,851
I mean,

1420
00:34:22,851 --> 00:34:23,181
she's,

1421
00:34:23,181 --> 00:34:24,470
she's a beast.

1422
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:25,850
She's a beast.

1423
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:28,910
Do you believe it has
anything to do with the,

1424
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:31,190
the nutrients that are in pancakes,

1425
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,093
pancakes,

1426
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,073
pancakes,

1427
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:37,980
there?

1428
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,810
The Dutch people were like,

1429
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,490
pancakes and smokes and biggest,

1430
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,413
I don't know.

1431
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,311
I don't know.

1432
00:34:43,311 --> 00:34:44,090
I don't think so.

1433
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:45,800
I think it probably has
to do with marijuana.

1434
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:47,840
Marijuana is making the girl,

1435
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:48,231
no,

1436
00:34:48,231 --> 00:34:48,951
I think it's just,

1437
00:34:48,951 --> 00:34:49,310
you know,

1438
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:51,740
probably hardy people you know are hardy.

1439
00:34:51,741 --> 00:34:52,910
It's gets cold as fuck.

1440
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:55,280
They're all the strong survived.

1441
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,061
It's like Vikings.

1442
00:34:56,061 --> 00:34:57,080
Why are they so fucking big?

1443
00:34:57,290 --> 00:35:00,770
Like those people in Iceland that always
win those a strongest man competitions.

1444
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:01,671
Why is that?

1445
00:35:01,671 --> 00:35:04,640
Why is it all these Iceland guys
to keep winning when you see them,

1446
00:35:04,641 --> 00:35:05,030
you go,

1447
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:05,863
oh yeah,

1448
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,880
I get it as a fucking viking.

1449
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,480
That's a,

1450
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,920
that's a viking that made it
to 2015 with some viking genes.

1451
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:12,470
They,

1452
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:12,821
you know,

1453
00:35:12,821 --> 00:35:16,100
nothing else to do besides pick up big
boulders and put them in a hundred meters

1454
00:35:16,101 --> 00:35:16,790
down the road.

1455
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:19,860
But it's interesting what you said
though about Jorena when she fought a

1456
00:35:19,861 --> 00:35:20,361
sidebar,

1457
00:35:20,361 --> 00:35:21,260
because I'll tell you what,

1458
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:21,711
you know,

1459
00:35:21,711 --> 00:35:24,920
I was super impressed with her technique
and super impressed with our skill

1460
00:35:24,921 --> 00:35:25,191
level,

1461
00:35:25,191 --> 00:35:29,360
but I was impressed with Cyborg grit and
determination because she was getting

1462
00:35:29,361 --> 00:35:33,350
her fucking ass kicked and she hung in
there and she kept trying to win that

1463
00:35:33,351 --> 00:35:33,651
fight.

1464
00:35:33,651 --> 00:35:35,660
She kept chasing that girl down and she,

1465
00:35:35,661 --> 00:35:36,680
and she was getting beat.

1466
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:40,500
She was getting beat and she was losing
and she was technically outmatched.

1467
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,400
You know,

1468
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,720
I think there's a difference in,

1469
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:43,350
um,

1470
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:47,370
someone who's really good at hitting
things hard and someone who's really good

1471
00:35:47,371 --> 00:35:48,204
at my tie,

1472
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:50,160
someone who's really good
at setting things up,

1473
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:50,720
you know?

1474
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,990
And I think that what she can do
better than Cyborg is set things up

1475
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,100
technically.

1476
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:56,761
You know,

1477
00:35:56,761 --> 00:35:59,100
and it's not the sidewalk
can't learn that.

1478
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,120
She certainly can.

1479
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,590
But when you see someone who's used
to like take downs and submissions and

1480
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,060
dealing with little gloves and dealing
with fighting people that are nowhere

1481
00:36:09,061 --> 00:36:10,440
near her technical level,

1482
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:14,040
that was without a doubt the best striker
Cyborg ever faced because she's been

1483
00:36:14,041 --> 00:36:16,770
fighting girls that literally
there've been assaults,

1484
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,640
you know,

1485
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,301
you've seen a lot.

1486
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:20,280
Like the toughest girl she
ever fall was Gina Carano.

1487
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:20,610
Yes.

1488
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:21,181
And you know,

1489
00:36:21,181 --> 00:36:21,810
she,

1490
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:22,710
that was a good fight.

1491
00:36:22,711 --> 00:36:25,050
It was a good fight up until
cyborg started beating her down.

1492
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:27,660
But the level of Moit high,

1493
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:29,550
like in someone like lion fight,

1494
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:31,440
like the girl who was the
girl who fought into this,

1495
00:36:31,441 --> 00:36:31,740
uh,

1496
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:32,760
this past weekend,

1497
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:35,030
she's very good from check.

1498
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:35,670
Yes.

1499
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,240
Yeah.

1500
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,230
From the Czech Republic.

1501
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:39,661
All apologies,

1502
00:36:39,661 --> 00:36:41,610
I forget her name but she
was very good as well.

1503
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,570
Very tough.

1504
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:44,880
But that was a pleasure to
watch that fight cause those,

1505
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:46,710
those girls were very technical,

1506
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:47,783
you know,

1507
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:50,070
drain and brought to the table
with the Cyborg flight was,

1508
00:36:50,071 --> 00:36:51,810
I'm a letter frank kicks to the face,

1509
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:52,420
which,

1510
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:55,080
which I don't think Nma people use 'em as,

1511
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:55,381
as,

1512
00:36:55,381 --> 00:36:58,980
as effectively because they can't use it
because the catches in the takedown and

1513
00:36:58,981 --> 00:37:02,350
also the straight up knees because
during her stay at all what,

1514
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:04,470
what a normal person
would throw to the bloody,

1515
00:37:04,471 --> 00:37:05,430
she can throw to the face,

1516
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,690
no problem whatsoever.

1517
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,870
So all of a sudden you have those
two different elements coming at Ya.

1518
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,300
And then,

1519
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:10,890
uh,

1520
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:13,470
and that's what kept leaning over
and edit that kept dropping her,

1521
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,830
especially when she was holding the ropes
and taping in the corner and stream.

1522
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,080
And cyborg was rushing in
to try and knock her out.

1523
00:37:19,081 --> 00:37:20,820
And straight into his friend kicks.

1524
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,470
She throws it to the body.

1525
00:37:22,471 --> 00:37:22,921
Well too.

1526
00:37:22,921 --> 00:37:26,520
She did that in this fight to that she
throws that front kick to the body real

1527
00:37:26,521 --> 00:37:30,210
well and she follows it up with nice
straight punches and she sold long.

1528
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,520
She keeps you at the end of her punches.

1529
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:32,990
Yeah,

1530
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:34,020
I man,

1531
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:38,040
I get frustrated when I see that more is
not more popular in the United States.

1532
00:37:38,041 --> 00:37:38,874
I really do.

1533
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:39,331
You know,

1534
00:37:39,331 --> 00:37:39,691
and I know,

1535
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:43,080
I know I'm not the only one because the
big thing that everybody always says

1536
00:37:43,081 --> 00:37:43,890
about MMA,

1537
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:47,040
which of course I disagree with
because I have a background in Jujitsu,

1538
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:49,050
but that when it goes to
the ground that it's boring.

1539
00:37:49,051 --> 00:37:52,200
I don't think it's boring because I
understand what's happening and to me it's

1540
00:37:52,201 --> 00:37:52,831
fascinating.

1541
00:37:52,831 --> 00:37:56,340
I want to see like a guy like
Damien Maia when he takes guys down,

1542
00:37:56,341 --> 00:37:56,940
strangles him.

1543
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:57,810
To me that's beautiful.

1544
00:37:57,811 --> 00:37:58,560
That's art.

1545
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,040
I want to,

1546
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,230
I want to see like how
he's setting things up.

1547
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:01,771
You know,

1548
00:38:01,771 --> 00:38:03,230
when he fought Neil Magnin,

1549
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:03,901
his last fight,

1550
00:38:03,901 --> 00:38:07,380
I couldn't wait to interview him because
he made some adjustments on the ground

1551
00:38:07,381 --> 00:38:10,410
and took the guy's back and the
guy was defending in the first,

1552
00:38:10,411 --> 00:38:10,650
uh,

1553
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:11,161
first round.

1554
00:38:11,161 --> 00:38:11,730
I was like,

1555
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:13,230
what adjustment did you make?

1556
00:38:13,231 --> 00:38:13,590
Like how did,

1557
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:13,941
what did you,

1558
00:38:13,941 --> 00:38:17,790
and he was explaining it to me and I could
see the technique and the art in his,

1559
00:38:17,791 --> 00:38:19,920
in his words like it to him,

1560
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,690
it was a problem to be solved.

1561
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,650
And that's,

1562
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:24,450
I see that in Moitai too.

1563
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,321
And I think,

1564
00:38:25,321 --> 00:38:25,800
um,

1565
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,700
for um,

1566
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,121
you know,

1567
00:38:27,121 --> 00:38:28,840
everybody that like the,

1568
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:29,970
the meatheads that watch,

1569
00:38:29,971 --> 00:38:31,650
I'm a mess when it goes to the ground.

1570
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,270
Well why don't you like my tie then?

1571
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:38,020
Why is it more tie like the most
popular combat sport in the world?

1572
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,580
Cause it's all stand up.

1573
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:41,170
And if you watch lion fight,

1574
00:38:41,171 --> 00:38:41,351
man,

1575
00:38:41,351 --> 00:38:42,520
you might see five,

1576
00:38:42,521 --> 00:38:43,810
six knockouts a night.

1577
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,190
Like a dream killer.

1578
00:38:45,191 --> 00:38:48,490
Balano that fucking kid with a
spinning elbow cay on his last fight.

1579
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:49,930
Holy Shit.

1580
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:51,250
Wild stuff,

1581
00:38:51,251 --> 00:38:51,970
man.

1582
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:52,331
You know,

1583
00:38:52,331 --> 00:38:52,930
it's just,

1584
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:57,160
I think also like access TV is
one of those weird stations.

1585
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,420
Mark Cuban owns it.

1586
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:00,690
It's at the end of the dial and direct TV.

1587
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,810
Can't fucking find it.

1588
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:02,501
You know,

1589
00:39:02,501 --> 00:39:02,801
I mean,

1590
00:39:02,801 --> 00:39:07,240
I think that it's one of those things
where somehow or another there has to be a

1591
00:39:07,241 --> 00:39:10,720
consciousness shift where people
have to be able to appreciate it.

1592
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,560
You know,

1593
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,970
and I don't know what that shift is.

1594
00:39:12,971 --> 00:39:14,110
I don't know how to make that shift.

1595
00:39:14,111 --> 00:39:18,340
I don't know what it would be that would
cause it to get on some big event on

1596
00:39:18,341 --> 00:39:18,971
television,

1597
00:39:18,971 --> 00:39:19,410
you know,

1598
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:20,290
yachts and climb,

1599
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:22,020
maybe you and yachts and Cli again,

1600
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:22,570
again,

1601
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:23,310
again,

1602
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:24,490
you trying to get me killed.

1603
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:24,761
Come on,

1604
00:39:24,761 --> 00:39:25,594
get paid him.

1605
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,080
Uh,

1606
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:26,830
I was lucky.

1607
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:27,750
I was very lucky at this.

1608
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,170
The SSJ and judges,

1609
00:39:29,171 --> 00:39:29,740
I was lucky.

1610
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:30,250
You are,

1611
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:31,083
you're them.

1612
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,013
You're too kind.

1613
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,413
I think they're just,

1614
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:36,230
I just need some exposure because what,

1615
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,830
what of what I've realized is I'm lucky,

1616
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,160
I think I said this last time as well.

1617
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:42,370
The UFC has so good at making superstars.

1618
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:43,870
And then when you,

1619
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:45,011
for instance,

1620
00:39:45,011 --> 00:39:46,210
I'm Gloria Line flight,

1621
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,080
uh,

1622
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,870
you can say it's a spa
spoiling us fighting,

1623
00:39:49,871 --> 00:39:50,121
cooking,

1624
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:50,954
Saki for instance.

1625
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:51,560
Amazing.

1626
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:56,170
Nobody knows who they are besides
the hardcore [inaudible] but um,

1627
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:58,480
amazing because MMA is so big.

1628
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:02,340
Everyone knows the cowboy Cerrone's
everyone knows their joints ain't pas.

1629
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,161
So when,

1630
00:40:03,161 --> 00:40:03,791
when they fight,

1631
00:40:03,791 --> 00:40:04,780
you already know the history.

1632
00:40:04,781 --> 00:40:06,310
You already know this guy is a killer.

1633
00:40:06,311 --> 00:40:07,090
This guy's,

1634
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:08,290
this guy's going to talk shit,

1635
00:40:08,291 --> 00:40:10,020
this guy going to it's yes.

1636
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:10,660
But you know what?

1637
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,740
That's only been the case for,

1638
00:40:11,741 --> 00:40:12,760
for 10 years.

1639
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,210
Yeah,

1640
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:13,930
true.

1641
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:15,160
In 2005,

1642
00:40:15,161 --> 00:40:18,910
when Stephan Bonner and Forrest
Griffin fought on Spike TV,

1643
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,830
nobody knew who the fuck those guys were.

1644
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:21,600
They,

1645
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,270
they were,

1646
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:25,180
they were fighting so hard
that at one point in time,

1647
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:29,950
I believe the statistics was the statistic
was 10 million people were watching

1648
00:40:29,951 --> 00:40:30,610
that fight,

1649
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:33,340
which for a cable TV
fight was fucking insane.

1650
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,010
And the reason why so many
people watched it is they,

1651
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,270
they started watching it.

1652
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,100
It was like 3 million people
or something like that.

1653
00:40:39,101 --> 00:40:40,480
Cause it was the final spike TV.

1654
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:45,840
And during the fight the numbers went
up like substantially and they believe

1655
00:40:47,261 --> 00:40:49,360
that people were literally
calling people up and going,

1656
00:40:49,361 --> 00:40:52,690
you've got these crazy white motherfuckers
are beating the shit out of each

1657
00:40:52,691 --> 00:40:53,590
other on spike TV.

1658
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:54,970
Go turn this on right now.

1659
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:59,650
And they literally believe that it was
through word of mouth during the fight

1660
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,160
that changed MMA history
because during that fight,

1661
00:41:03,161 --> 00:41:07,030
because it was so crazy and so
wild and those guys just picked up,

1662
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:11,740
pedal to the metal and went nuts
for the entire fight and it was,

1663
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:14,560
there were so evenly matched
that after it was over,

1664
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:15,580
a sport was made.

1665
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:15,851
I mean it was,

1666
00:41:15,851 --> 00:41:17,530
sport was made by one fight.

1667
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:17,960
I,

1668
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,140
that's not an exaggeration
because to this day,

1669
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:23,410
although it was a great
performance by Diego Sanchez,

1670
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:26,530
nobody talks about Diego
Sanchez versus Kenny Florian.

1671
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,070
Yep.

1672
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:31,150
Diego Sanchez fought Kenny Florian for
the 185 pound title on that same night.

1673
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:33,320
And Diego took Kenny down
and beat the shit of him,

1674
00:41:33,321 --> 00:41:34,154
stopped him.

1675
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,540
But nobody talks about that fight.

1676
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,390
It was the fight between those two guys.

1677
00:41:38,391 --> 00:41:38,661
But you,

1678
00:41:38,661 --> 00:41:43,190
Forrest Griffin and Stephan Bonner that
literally made MMA and from then on the,

1679
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,170
the numbers just started going crazy.

1680
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:48,530
Like everybody started tuning in and
it just picked up and then the ultimate

1681
00:41:48,531 --> 00:41:51,200
fighter took off and then it picked
up more and more and more and more.

1682
00:41:51,201 --> 00:41:53,060
And then it became a huge sport,

1683
00:41:53,061 --> 00:41:55,850
but it literally was
born out of one event.

1684
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:56,480
Yup.

1685
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,320
Like that was,

1686
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:59,460
we need something like that for Moy Tai.

1687
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,310
We need something like
that for kickboxing.

1688
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,440
One big thing where people go,

1689
00:42:03,441 --> 00:42:04,760
Holy Shit.

1690
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:06,290
And if that can happen,

1691
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:07,124
I think in,

1692
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:10,390
you also need a promoter
like Dana White and uh,

1693
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:10,910
you know,

1694
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:13,220
owners like the Fertittas you need some,

1695
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:18,370
some powerful organization has got balls
and money and really gets behind it and

1696
00:42:18,371 --> 00:42:19,370
they need a lot of luck.

1697
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:19,940
Yes.

1698
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:20,480
Well that's it.

1699
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,380
I didn't know how Kaitlyn,

1700
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,460
I'm fucked up because,

1701
00:42:22,461 --> 00:42:23,294
um,

1702
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,620
they had everything they had,

1703
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:27,413
they

1704
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:35,080
had the money that the TV
that had the slow motions,

1705
00:42:35,081 --> 00:42:35,960
they had the highlights.

1706
00:42:35,961 --> 00:42:37,330
It had the missing fingers.

1707
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:40,880
Has the dudes with the body
suits the body tattoos?

1708
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:41,680
Yeah.

1709
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,081
I don't know,

1710
00:42:42,081 --> 00:42:42,780
man.

1711
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:43,310
They,

1712
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:43,700
um,

1713
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,260
they were gigantic in Japan,

1714
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:46,401
they have disappeared.

1715
00:42:46,401 --> 00:42:46,790
It's like,

1716
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:47,390
where do we go?

1717
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:48,500
Where does the kickboxing go?

1718
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:50,690
If I'm a young kid and
I'm watching the TV,

1719
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:51,590
do I,

1720
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:54,500
UFC is the only only way to get,

1721
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:54,800
Hey,

1722
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,850
do you want to be a more typhoid?

1723
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:56,960
Why?

1724
00:42:57,610 --> 00:42:58,460
Like I can be,

1725
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:59,790
I can be on a,

1726
00:42:59,791 --> 00:43:04,791
on a cereal box or now it's gone so
far that you can't be a legitimate,

1727
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:06,860
um,

1728
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:07,700
household name.

1729
00:43:07,701 --> 00:43:08,590
Whereas in Moitai,

1730
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:09,380
uh,

1731
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:12,130
you might get a few little medals
or trophies to putting on your,

1732
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:13,280
your pool room.

1733
00:43:13,281 --> 00:43:13,820
But yeah,

1734
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:14,331
there's no,

1735
00:43:14,331 --> 00:43:15,164
there's no,

1736
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:17,900
no one driving Mercedes
Benz is as a return.

1737
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:20,451
There's no,

1738
00:43:20,451 --> 00:43:22,970
there's not even a hundred thousand
dollar payday for him when he guy,

1739
00:43:22,971 --> 00:43:23,321
if you've,

1740
00:43:23,321 --> 00:43:23,520
you've,

1741
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,590
you get 10 grand,

1742
00:43:24,591 --> 00:43:25,000
you're like,

1743
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:25,320
yeah,

1744
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,153
10 grain.

1745
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,260
Yeah,

1746
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:28,370
but I still got to go to work Monday.

1747
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:29,623
Yeah.

1748
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:31,843
And for women

1749
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:32,860
even crazier,

1750
00:43:32,861 --> 00:43:33,161
I mean,

1751
00:43:33,161 --> 00:43:35,770
think about the small group of talent,

1752
00:43:35,771 --> 00:43:37,780
the depth of talent in women's MMA.

1753
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,460
Like there's a perfect example.

1754
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:42,940
The UFC 115 pounds strawweight champion,

1755
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:43,480
you honor,

1756
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,790
you and Jay check is a Moitai champion.

1757
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:50,620
Six time world Muay Thai champion
and she's just murdering checks.

1758
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:51,550
Just murdering.

1759
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,110
She's nasty.

1760
00:43:53,111 --> 00:43:53,741
She's business.

1761
00:43:53,741 --> 00:43:55,540
She is so nasty.

1762
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:58,210
But other than her,

1763
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:01,930
you know you have a bunch of people
in her division that are really,

1764
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:02,831
honestly,

1765
00:44:02,831 --> 00:44:06,610
there's a few with some experience
that are getting better,

1766
00:44:06,611 --> 00:44:08,830
but they're not world championship level.

1767
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:09,693
Yes.

1768
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:14,110
And if you're a girl who wants to make
it in fighting and you look at the pool

1769
00:44:14,111 --> 00:44:16,660
of talent that's in the UFC right
now in the women's division,

1770
00:44:16,661 --> 00:44:18,460
especially 115 pound division,

1771
00:44:18,461 --> 00:44:20,590
you're going to be compelled
to try to make it there.

1772
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:21,200
Yup.

1773
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,340
At one 35 you got that murderer,

1774
00:44:23,341 --> 00:44:25,990
Ronda Rousey flipping bitches
on their heads and shit.

1775
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,730
Snapping arms.

1776
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,000
That's a tough one because
she's so advanced you,

1777
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:32,003
she's so,

1778
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:36,300
she's so advanced that she's just smashing
everybody they put in front of her.

1779
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:37,170
So that's a,

1780
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:40,500
that's a tough one because you would have
to learn how to grapple at a very high

1781
00:44:40,501 --> 00:44:42,930
level to even be able to
hang in there with her.

1782
00:44:42,931 --> 00:44:45,270
And now are her striking
is getting way better too.

1783
00:44:45,271 --> 00:44:47,040
So it becomes problematic.

1784
00:44:47,041 --> 00:44:50,340
But what is the one thing that no
one's ever done to Ronda Rousey?

1785
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,110
Kicked the shit out of her legs.

1786
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:52,951
Strike.

1787
00:44:52,951 --> 00:44:53,784
Keep her away.

1788
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:54,481
Keep her away.

1789
00:44:54,481 --> 00:44:56,610
Stuff to take down and kick
the shit out of her legs.

1790
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:58,500
We haven't seen that at all.

1791
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,210
Like at all we've seen.

1792
00:45:00,211 --> 00:45:01,044
No.

1793
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:06,320
How much would you like to see a world
championship level Moyie Thai fighter

1794
00:45:06,331 --> 00:45:06,871
like Yolanda,

1795
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:10,590
you and Jay check who's fighting at
one through a natural one 35 who fights

1796
00:45:10,591 --> 00:45:11,424
Ronda Rousey.

1797
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:15,660
Someone who comes out there and you see
this like super high level striking game

1798
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:17,730
with good takedown defense since bras.

1799
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:18,990
Now you got to fight.

1800
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:20,730
Now you've got some crazy shit happen.

1801
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,520
That's what we're supposed to expect
with cases that cause the Ghana.

1802
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,020
That was supposed to happen in February.

1803
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:25,441
Yeah,

1804
00:45:25,441 --> 00:45:28,940
but cats and Ganos not
worldclass in Moitai tough.

1805
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:29,640
The bill went,

1806
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,090
then she ran into dive into your arms.

1807
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:33,260
Okay,

1808
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:34,093
what did you,

1809
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:37,290
she's going to be laying in
bed for a really long time ago.

1810
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:38,183
What did I do?

1811
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:38,630
Well,

1812
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:42,900
cats in Ghana also you have to think
as never fought in that stage before.

1813
00:45:42,901 --> 00:45:47,901
That stage itself is just such a
mind fuck standing in that octagon,

1814
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:50,580
the bright lights,

1815
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,230
the cameras are on you and you're like,

1816
00:45:52,231 --> 00:45:53,064
wow.

1817
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:53,821
You know what I mean?

1818
00:45:53,821 --> 00:45:56,790
That's probably half the
reason why she made that mad,

1819
00:45:56,791 --> 00:46:00,750
crazy bum rush across the octagon
and just wanting an attacker.

1820
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:01,350
Yeah.

1821
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:01,830
Yeah.

1822
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:02,130
Um,

1823
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:05,190
I heard the same thing from Therese
when I was training with George.

1824
00:46:05,191 --> 00:46:05,521
He says,

1825
00:46:05,521 --> 00:46:09,630
people who don't understand that they
fight in the prelims and then yeah,

1826
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:11,670
because George has done it so many times.

1827
00:46:11,671 --> 00:46:12,810
He said you used to the pressure,

1828
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:15,780
but then you get the guys
that are fighting George and
then all of a sudden it's

1829
00:46:15,781 --> 00:46:16,180
five,

1830
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:17,870
five [inaudible] and the posters,

1831
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:18,820
you're doing the oil,

1832
00:46:18,821 --> 00:46:19,621
the oil,

1833
00:46:19,621 --> 00:46:20,454
the media,

1834
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:21,291
and then the,

1835
00:46:21,291 --> 00:46:22,080
the,

1836
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:27,010
you have to walk out in front of that
25,000 people or whatever the MGM or

1837
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:28,710
[inaudible] when he fought Toronto,

1838
00:46:28,711 --> 00:46:30,650
Toronto 60 say,

1839
00:46:31,810 --> 00:46:32,730
and you're the bad guy,

1840
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:32,991
you're,

1841
00:46:32,991 --> 00:46:33,300
yeah.

1842
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:34,133
In Canada.

1843
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:36,031
And then,

1844
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:36,630
uh,

1845
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:37,201
yeah,

1846
00:46:37,201 --> 00:46:39,270
the pressure just breaks
them before they even walk.

1847
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:39,760
Well,

1848
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,710
Brixton probably weeks
in advance and then,

1849
00:46:41,711 --> 00:46:42,630
and then the day comes,

1850
00:46:42,631 --> 00:46:43,470
you think you can handle it.

1851
00:46:43,471 --> 00:46:44,610
And the day comes and then yes,

1852
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:48,090
you implode on the inside or not.

1853
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:49,500
Or you look Jon Jones,

1854
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:52,350
you fight Shogun and your
first world title fight,

1855
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:54,570
you're 24 years old and you beat his ass.

1856
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:56,190
He stopped them and everybody goes,

1857
00:46:56,191 --> 00:46:57,450
Holy Shit,

1858
00:46:57,451 --> 00:46:58,290
look at this guy.

1859
00:46:58,710 --> 00:46:59,011
I mean,

1860
00:46:59,011 --> 00:47:00,630
I think John was 23 actually,

1861
00:47:00,631 --> 00:47:01,560
now that I think about it,

1862
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:03,570
he was the youngest ever UFC champion.

1863
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:08,460
And I believe that Josh Barnett won the
UFC heavyweight title when he was 24 so

1864
00:47:08,461 --> 00:47:10,260
I think I might be off by this,

1865
00:47:10,261 --> 00:47:11,710
but I think John was 23 yeah,

1866
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:12,570
that's,

1867
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:13,710
that's a special guy.

1868
00:47:13,850 --> 00:47:14,130
You know,

1869
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:14,491
John,

1870
00:47:14,491 --> 00:47:16,110
just a special competitor.

1871
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:18,660
And I think that for
someone like Cat Zingano,

1872
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,720
that media pressure is
just as much pressure.

1873
00:47:21,721 --> 00:47:24,600
Having all those people
ask you what's it like?

1874
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:25,890
What's it going to be like
when you get in there?

1875
00:47:25,891 --> 00:47:26,641
How are you going to win?

1876
00:47:26,641 --> 00:47:27,060
Who's going to,

1877
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:28,470
how are you going to beat Rhonda?

1878
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:30,310
What are you gonna do about her arm bars?

1879
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:30,820
You know,

1880
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:30,980
I mean,

1881
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:31,511
think about that.

1882
00:47:31,511 --> 00:47:32,440
What are you gonna to better arm bar?

1883
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,600
I'm not worried about
that fucking 15 seconds.

1884
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:37,890
And your arm barred dentally
question the end of the equation.

1885
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:38,201
Yeah.

1886
00:47:38,201 --> 00:47:43,201
And then you get our hard times that
by 10,000 times every period of three

1887
00:47:43,391 --> 00:47:44,224
months prep.

1888
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:46,550
It's a mind fuck yeah.

1889
00:47:46,610 --> 00:47:47,530
Driving insane.

1890
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:48,760
But I think someone like you,

1891
00:47:48,761 --> 00:47:51,580
Ana who is a world champion already,

1892
00:47:51,581 --> 00:47:55,870
she's so used to competing
at an incredibly high level
and then she had to get

1893
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,030
her bearings in the UFC.

1894
00:47:58,090 --> 00:48:00,890
She had that a one really
tough fight with Claudia.

1895
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:01,250
Good day.

1896
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:01,510
Yeah.

1897
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:02,680
Where it was neck and neck.

1898
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:03,071
Very,

1899
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:03,904
very close fight.

1900
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:06,490
And then from then on she's
gone to just dominate.

1901
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:08,620
And I think that a woman like that,

1902
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:11,230
like if you could find something
like that at one 35 it would be very

1903
00:48:11,231 --> 00:48:14,680
interesting because although Rhonda
is getting better at striking,

1904
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:17,860
you very rarely if ever
see her throw kicks.

1905
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:18,693
It's very rare.

1906
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:19,120
Yes.

1907
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:21,790
And for someone who's a
good Moint tie fighter man,

1908
00:48:21,791 --> 00:48:22,121
that is,

1909
00:48:22,121 --> 00:48:25,870
and also Ron has notoriously
has had problems with her knees.

1910
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:26,800
You know,

1911
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:31,150
I think you have to find someone that
can fight going backwards is because run

1912
00:48:31,151 --> 00:48:34,690
the charges across the cage and then
anyone that silly enough to stand in front

1913
00:48:34,691 --> 00:48:37,180
of it and think they can strike
standing on the split dead,

1914
00:48:37,181 --> 00:48:38,560
they're going to get taken
down the straight away.

1915
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:39,521
So you're gonna have to,

1916
00:48:39,521 --> 00:48:40,480
you don't have to be mobile,

1917
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:42,910
otherwise she's going to grab
you and flip it upside down.

1918
00:48:42,911 --> 00:48:46,570
And then when you hit an inside out and
then you're also going to have to be

1919
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:48,730
world class as an athlete.

1920
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:50,830
And I think that she is,

1921
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:55,330
but I don't think anybody she's
ever fought is except maybe Sarah.

1922
00:48:55,590 --> 00:48:56,423
Um,

1923
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:57,303
you could say,

1924
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:57,690
well,

1925
00:48:57,690 --> 00:48:58,091
who was,

1926
00:48:58,091 --> 00:48:58,810
um,

1927
00:48:58,810 --> 00:48:59,643
um,

1928
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:01,180
not Alexis Davis,

1929
00:49:01,181 --> 00:49:02,810
but a Sarah McMahon who's,

1930
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:03,580
was that her name?

1931
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:06,340
The Olympic gold medal at the Olympic
silver medalist and wrestling.

1932
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:06,850
Yep.

1933
00:49:06,850 --> 00:49:07,150
Yeah,

1934
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:09,820
she was obviously an excellent wrestler,

1935
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:10,271
you know,

1936
00:49:10,271 --> 00:49:11,620
so you've got that.

1937
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:13,600
She was at obviously
an excellent wrestler,

1938
00:49:13,601 --> 00:49:15,940
but as an MMA fighter,

1939
00:49:15,941 --> 00:49:16,450
she just,

1940
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:18,520
there's like some holes in her game,

1941
00:49:18,521 --> 00:49:18,881
you know,

1942
00:49:18,881 --> 00:49:19,301
and she's,

1943
00:49:19,301 --> 00:49:21,340
she's not very good
off of her back either.

1944
00:49:21,341 --> 00:49:23,620
She gets put on her back
and she doesn't do so well,

1945
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:25,090
but I think Ron does.

1946
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:27,130
She's a winner overall.

1947
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,840
Like that's like the most important thing.

1948
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:30,220
Like that person,

1949
00:49:30,221 --> 00:49:31,950
like the John Jones mentality,

1950
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:35,230
the person who just knows how to win
is not going to get rattled by the

1951
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:39,120
pressure's not going to get rattled by
all the hype and all the bullshit talk is

1952
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:41,410
going to be able to go in
there and perform at their,

1953
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,600
at their maximum level.

1954
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:45,280
Rhonda obviously can do that,

1955
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:45,881
you know,

1956
00:49:45,881 --> 00:49:47,950
and she even said recently,

1957
00:49:47,951 --> 00:49:48,281
she said,

1958
00:49:48,281 --> 00:49:49,510
the more fucked up and crazy,

1959
00:49:49,511 --> 00:49:52,060
her life is more fucked up and
crazy things are the better.

1960
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:52,930
She fights hay,

1961
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:54,670
which is just nuts.

1962
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:56,440
Last flight with them,

1963
00:49:56,441 --> 00:49:56,950
Beth.

1964
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:57,650
Um,

1965
00:49:57,650 --> 00:49:57,951
that,

1966
00:49:57,951 --> 00:49:59,110
that right hand you landed,

1967
00:49:59,140 --> 00:49:59,800
you don't,

1968
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:03,430
you've never seen an another go look
at another go with a single punch side.

1969
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:05,170
That insane.

1970
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:06,161
Not an MMA.

1971
00:50:06,161 --> 00:50:08,140
At least the only time
I've ever seen that in,

1972
00:50:08,141 --> 00:50:08,680
um,

1973
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:09,850
in kickboxing.

1974
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:10,570
Well,

1975
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:11,170
you know what,

1976
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:13,960
Holly Holm was knocked some
bitches dead with head kicks,

1977
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:14,710
head kicks,

1978
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:15,150
Butt Butt,

1979
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:15,341
Butt,

1980
00:50:15,341 --> 00:50:16,280
a singer right down there.

1981
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:16,750
That was,

1982
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:17,481
that was nasty.

1983
00:50:17,481 --> 00:50:18,100
And it was nice.

1984
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:20,320
It wasn't like she just
a flash knockdown either.

1985
00:50:20,321 --> 00:50:20,711
She was,

1986
00:50:20,711 --> 00:50:21,544
she was out,

1987
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:22,211
she was dead.

1988
00:50:22,211 --> 00:50:24,100
She was dating when she was hurt already.

1989
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:25,360
W and then you know,

1990
00:50:25,361 --> 00:50:26,830
she tagged her was fucked up.

1991
00:50:26,831 --> 00:50:29,600
Is she tagged with the right
hand then as she's going down,

1992
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:31,310
Rhonda was already thrown the left.

1993
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:31,610
Yep.

1994
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:32,001
You know,

1995
00:50:32,001 --> 00:50:33,680
and the left landed two as she was,

1996
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:35,270
her body was already given out.

1997
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:36,050
Yes.

1998
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:36,890
That was nasty.

1999
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:37,301
That was,

2000
00:50:37,301 --> 00:50:40,340
that was a wakeup call to a lot of people
that she's like learning how to strike

2001
00:50:40,341 --> 00:50:40,850
too.

2002
00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:43,230
But all with all due respect,

2003
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:46,700
[inaudible] is a brawler
like her technique is,

2004
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:48,170
it's not that good.

2005
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:53,500
She throws like kind of arm punches and
she's like physically like bull doggish

2006
00:50:54,430 --> 00:50:57,140
you know she's tough and
strong but she's not,

2007
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:57,681
you know,

2008
00:50:57,681 --> 00:50:58,940
she's not moving like,

2009
00:50:58,941 --> 00:50:59,990
like yo Jay check.

2010
00:50:59,991 --> 00:51:00,621
You know what I'm saying?

2011
00:51:00,621 --> 00:51:02,870
Like she's not moving
like an elite striker.

2012
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:07,070
She's throwing barrages of punches and
the pressure for her must have been off

2013
00:51:07,071 --> 00:51:11,540
the fucking charts in Brazil
fighting Ronda Rousey,

2014
00:51:11,541 --> 00:51:13,130
talking so much shit.

2015
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:17,570
And then she fucked up and talked about
Rhonda is Dad and suicide and all that.

2016
00:51:17,571 --> 00:51:17,810
And then,

2017
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:19,150
oh,

2018
00:51:19,530 --> 00:51:21,650
the Brazilians kind of
turned on her for that.

2019
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:24,890
And then at the Wayans the
Brazilians were cheering Rhonda,

2020
00:51:24,891 --> 00:51:26,570
which never happens.

2021
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,010
Like that's,

2022
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:29,690
that's how much she's transcended.

2023
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:32,720
She can go to Brazil and the
Brazilians would cheer her.

2024
00:51:32,721 --> 00:51:33,950
I've never seen that in my life.

2025
00:51:33,951 --> 00:51:34,940
Wait till she eats Australia.

2026
00:51:34,941 --> 00:51:35,301
And she's,

2027
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:35,810
um,

2028
00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:36,201
she's,

2029
00:51:36,201 --> 00:51:36,830
she's,

2030
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:39,110
she's a global phenomenon.

2031
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:41,930
She's amazing when she hits Australia,

2032
00:51:41,931 --> 00:51:43,700
I think the amount of support
she's going to get there,

2033
00:51:43,701 --> 00:51:44,990
it's going to be off the charts as well.

2034
00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:46,301
It's going to be a,

2035
00:51:46,301 --> 00:51:46,960
and then I switched.

2036
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,610
Holly had more fights in the UFC.

2037
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,050
Was gonna ask Ya on the,

2038
00:51:51,051 --> 00:51:51,651
on the side,

2039
00:51:51,651 --> 00:51:52,610
what do you think about that fight?

2040
00:51:52,611 --> 00:51:54,980
And I think I'm a little
bit early for pull Holly,

2041
00:51:55,010 --> 00:51:55,730
but Geez,

2042
00:51:55,730 --> 00:51:59,770
she's amazing books that she's still to
win so many more titles in boxing and

2043
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:01,420
then that head kicks a killer too.

2044
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:02,120
Like,

2045
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:02,331
well,

2046
00:52:02,331 --> 00:52:02,781
it's not that,

2047
00:52:02,781 --> 00:52:04,910
I don't think that Holly is capable.

2048
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:05,450
What I,

2049
00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:05,661
you know,

2050
00:52:05,661 --> 00:52:06,680
one of those things I said is like,

2051
00:52:06,681 --> 00:52:07,040
I don't,

2052
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,370
I don't think that's a smart fight
because I want to see her fight some more

2053
00:52:10,371 --> 00:52:10,790
people.

2054
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:11,541
I want to see her fight.

2055
00:52:11,541 --> 00:52:12,374
Misha Tate.

2056
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:13,640
I want to see her fight,

2057
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:14,503
you know,

2058
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:15,831
fill in the blank.

2059
00:52:15,831 --> 00:52:16,664
Amanda Nunez.

2060
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:20,420
I want to see her fight some tough
girls and put on a show and then,

2061
00:52:20,421 --> 00:52:20,721
you know,

2062
00:52:20,721 --> 00:52:22,370
have everybody like clamor for it.

2063
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:22,800
Yeah.

2064
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,550
I believe you had mentioned
the main that before.

2065
00:52:24,830 --> 00:52:25,220
She's,

2066
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:25,551
she's,

2067
00:52:25,551 --> 00:52:26,330
she's a terror.

2068
00:52:26,330 --> 00:52:28,640
She's knocked out Sarah
McMahon and her last fight,

2069
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:29,390
she was awesome.

2070
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:32,450
She's a beach day and you
can tell she wants it too.

2071
00:52:32,451 --> 00:52:32,930
She's not,

2072
00:52:32,930 --> 00:52:34,280
she's not in the base.

2073
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:34,760
The TC,

2074
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,230
she wants that title built bad.

2075
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:37,100
It is Sarah McMahon.

2076
00:52:37,101 --> 00:52:37,251
Right.

2077
00:52:37,251 --> 00:52:38,084
Am I saying that?

2078
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:39,613
Make sure I'm right.

2079
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:41,600
I'm almost positive I am,

2080
00:52:41,601 --> 00:52:42,890
but for one or for whatever reason,

2081
00:52:42,891 --> 00:52:45,440
I see her face in front of
me and for whatever reason,

2082
00:52:45,770 --> 00:52:47,660
Sarah seems like I fucked up day.

2083
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:49,310
I don't have too many names in my head,

2084
00:52:49,311 --> 00:52:49,670
man.

2085
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:50,503
I really do.

2086
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:51,561
Yeah,

2087
00:52:51,561 --> 00:52:52,160
it is right.

2088
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:52,993
Thank you.

2089
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:53,560
Um,

2090
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:53,750
uh,

2091
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:57,980
but I think Holly is physically
very capable without a doubt.

2092
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:59,990
And technically very
capable without a doubt.

2093
00:52:59,991 --> 00:53:01,630
Should be the best striker
run has ever faced.

2094
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:02,870
No question about it.

2095
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:03,230
Yes.

2096
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:05,240
It's whether or not she can
keep the fight standing.

2097
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:09,320
She can keep Rhonda offer whether she
could deal with the pressure when she goes

2098
00:53:09,321 --> 00:53:12,750
out there and they're 70,000 insane.

2099
00:53:12,830 --> 00:53:14,780
That's 10,000 more than
we've ever done before.

2100
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:15,300
So it's,

2101
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:16,490
and it's already almost sold out.

2102
00:53:16,491 --> 00:53:20,930
I think it's crazy if I'm fighting main
events in Albuquerque and to it to come

2103
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:24,350
into Australia and fighting in front of
it because footballs in the Melbourne

2104
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:26,400
and to across the octagon

2105
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,940
at that Blonde Damon coming out
to that fucking Joan Jett Song,

2106
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:31,300
g wised.

2107
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:34,540
I don't think I've ever heard
anyone call it or the the one Damon,

2108
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:35,483
he's a dean.

2109
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:36,571
He's no,

2110
00:53:36,571 --> 00:53:37,381
no question about it.

2111
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:37,601
And when,

2112
00:53:37,601 --> 00:53:40,860
when you're locked in that thing with
her and she goes after those girls,

2113
00:53:40,861 --> 00:53:41,694
that's a demon.

2114
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:42,763
And you know,

2115
00:53:42,790 --> 00:53:44,910
you say after we did
the podcast in February,

2116
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:45,181
um,

2117
00:53:45,181 --> 00:53:49,350
I was lucky enough to go to the UFC
hearing at the staples center and then,

2118
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:49,710
uh,

2119
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:51,570
we went to the lane and it was very cool.

2120
00:53:51,870 --> 00:53:52,530
And then,

2121
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:53,340
uh,

2122
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:58,260
so say Edmund and Rhonda walking down
the driveway to come into the hotel.

2123
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:00,450
And as a fan boy,

2124
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:02,220
I had my iPhone.

2125
00:54:02,221 --> 00:54:02,460
I was like,

2126
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:02,581
oh,

2127
00:54:02,581 --> 00:54:03,660
should I go ask for her phone?

2128
00:54:03,661 --> 00:54:04,500
I should ask her for her.

2129
00:54:04,970 --> 00:54:05,611
The I'll fuck it.

2130
00:54:05,611 --> 00:54:06,444
Why not?

2131
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:06,870
And then,

2132
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:07,181
and then,

2133
00:54:07,181 --> 00:54:07,981
and then I have,

2134
00:54:07,981 --> 00:54:10,380
she made I'Veh like a little
scared little boy and said,

2135
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:11,243
ah,

2136
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:11,431
oh,

2137
00:54:11,431 --> 00:54:12,021
excuse me running,

2138
00:54:12,021 --> 00:54:12,431
you didn't want to,

2139
00:54:12,431 --> 00:54:13,270
if I get a picture of it.

2140
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:13,741
And she goes,

2141
00:54:13,741 --> 00:54:13,921
oh,

2142
00:54:13,921 --> 00:54:14,281
sorry,

2143
00:54:14,281 --> 00:54:15,630
no photos until after the fight.

2144
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,370
And then I'm Edmond Headache,

2145
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:18,300
he's an arena.

2146
00:54:18,370 --> 00:54:21,330
And he's looked at me and then
he stopped her and he goes,

2147
00:54:21,331 --> 00:54:22,110
Hey,

2148
00:54:22,110 --> 00:54:23,100
this is the guy,

2149
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:24,630
this is the guy.

2150
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:26,280
And she's looked at Edmond has got an art,

2151
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:27,151
said this is the guy.

2152
00:54:27,151 --> 00:54:27,391
He goes,

2153
00:54:27,391 --> 00:54:28,380
this is the guy.

2154
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:29,171
Say He,

2155
00:54:29,171 --> 00:54:30,750
he's pushed her into my arms and said,

2156
00:54:30,751 --> 00:54:30,831
hey,

2157
00:54:30,831 --> 00:54:31,800
you gotta get a photo with him.

2158
00:54:31,801 --> 00:54:32,040
This,

2159
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,050
this is the Guy Admin knows who you are.

2160
00:54:34,051 --> 00:54:34,550
For sure.

2161
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:34,740
Yeah,

2162
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:35,380
he was on,

2163
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:36,001
he's amazing.

2164
00:54:36,001 --> 00:54:38,050
So then we took a photo and then we,

2165
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:39,091
she was,

2166
00:54:39,091 --> 00:54:39,901
she's amazing.

2167
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:41,130
She's such a cool person.

2168
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:42,631
I was so scared.

2169
00:54:42,631 --> 00:54:44,880
I was so star Trek and then
I'm sure it's just normal.

2170
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:45,601
And then,

2171
00:54:45,601 --> 00:54:46,081
uh,

2172
00:54:46,081 --> 00:54:48,960
and then afterwards I'll
come down and got some,

2173
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:52,740
a couple of drinks at the hotel bar there
and Edmond was there and he made his

2174
00:54:52,741 --> 00:54:54,600
way over to come and have a chat to me.

2175
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,180
And then we just talk like
a week long lost friends.

2176
00:54:57,390 --> 00:54:57,691
He was,

2177
00:54:57,691 --> 00:54:58,830
he was such a gentleman as well.

2178
00:54:58,831 --> 00:54:59,850
He was such a nice guy.

2179
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:01,010
Um,

2180
00:55:01,010 --> 00:55:01,481
people get,

2181
00:55:01,481 --> 00:55:01,710
uh,

2182
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:02,580
they have,

2183
00:55:02,581 --> 00:55:03,210
uh,

2184
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:04,390
for whatever reason they get,

2185
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:06,900
there's a misconception
about what he's like,

2186
00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:08,190
you know,

2187
00:55:08,190 --> 00:55:09,810
I think part of is the Armenian thing.

2188
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:10,380
You know,

2189
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:11,670
Armenians are so,

2190
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:12,870
they're so masculine,

2191
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:13,650
you know,

2192
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:13,861
and they,

2193
00:55:13,861 --> 00:55:17,010
they have this certain way
about them that a lot of people,

2194
00:55:17,011 --> 00:55:18,030
they misread that,

2195
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:18,780
you know,

2196
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:19,291
they're just,

2197
00:55:19,291 --> 00:55:19,710
uh,

2198
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:20,730
they're fun people.

2199
00:55:20,731 --> 00:55:21,120
Man.

2200
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:21,391
They're,

2201
00:55:21,391 --> 00:55:22,530
they're very proud,

2202
00:55:22,531 --> 00:55:23,490
very fun people.

2203
00:55:23,491 --> 00:55:23,990
I really,

2204
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:25,260
I'm a fan of Armenians.

2205
00:55:25,650 --> 00:55:28,230
I really liked them because I
sit in the ultimate fighter too,

2206
00:55:28,231 --> 00:55:30,750
so I was expecting a
certain sort of presence,

2207
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:32,850
but then when it was just,

2208
00:55:32,970 --> 00:55:33,601
he's a gentleman,

2209
00:55:33,601 --> 00:55:33,940
he's like,

2210
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:34,161
he's,

2211
00:55:34,161 --> 00:55:34,981
he's awesome.

2212
00:55:34,981 --> 00:55:35,814
He will say cool.

2213
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:37,120
And then him,

2214
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,810
and then we just started talking
about my attire and fighting.

2215
00:55:39,811 --> 00:55:42,750
And then I'm actually my wife who's a
fight on the same card as in back in the

2216
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:43,590
day when he was competing.

2217
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:44,311
So,

2218
00:55:44,311 --> 00:55:44,820
um,

2219
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:45,300
yeah,

2220
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,260
we compete.

2221
00:55:46,261 --> 00:55:46,520
Where did you,

2222
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:47,580
did you ever see him compete?

2223
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:48,450
Uh,

2224
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:50,040
they fought in the same
cards here and Kelly

2225
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:54,883
in Buena Park.

2226
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:56,251
That's when,

2227
00:55:56,251 --> 00:55:56,461
you know,

2228
00:55:56,461 --> 00:55:57,294
you're fucked.

2229
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:57,901
It's fight number.

2230
00:55:57,901 --> 00:55:58,734
I've just kidding.

2231
00:56:01,070 --> 00:56:01,903
When a park,

2232
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:02,670
um,

2233
00:56:02,670 --> 00:56:03,181
he's,

2234
00:56:03,181 --> 00:56:03,570
uh,

2235
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:06,150
he's done some great things
with other fighters too.

2236
00:56:06,151 --> 00:56:08,490
Like he's really improved
Travis Brown's hands,

2237
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:09,120
you know,

2238
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,500
he's done some real good work with him.

2239
00:56:10,501 --> 00:56:13,340
Like you saw 'em and Travis
Browne's fight against Brenda's,

2240
00:56:13,430 --> 00:56:15,210
you saw some sharp combinations,

2241
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:16,110
you know.

2242
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:16,590
Um,

2243
00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:17,131
but then again,

2244
00:56:17,131 --> 00:56:17,731
he got knocked up.

2245
00:56:17,731 --> 00:56:19,170
Rl asked you in the fight afterwards,

2246
00:56:19,171 --> 00:56:20,880
but that was just chaos.

2247
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,860
But I'd heard that like in the gym,

2248
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:24,280
it's an interesting dynamic

2249
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:25,031
between fighters.

2250
00:56:25,031 --> 00:56:26,170
Like sometimes fights,

2251
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:28,930
like when you look at guys on paper,

2252
00:56:28,931 --> 00:56:31,760
like Travis was ranked number
three in the world and our lost,

2253
00:56:31,761 --> 00:56:32,410
he wasn't,

2254
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:32,661
you know,

2255
00:56:32,661 --> 00:56:35,800
a Lawsky was a guy that everybody
thought was at the end of his,

2256
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:36,580
you know,

2257
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:37,413
his time.

2258
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:39,880
But our Lasky,

2259
00:56:40,290 --> 00:56:41,170
it's been a worldclass.

2260
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:43,530
Stryker for a long time are lost.

2261
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:45,640
You'd been a heavyweight
champion of the UFC,

2262
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:48,100
had a nasty power in his punches,

2263
00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:48,461
you know,

2264
00:56:48,461 --> 00:56:50,980
nasty right hand and in the gym,

2265
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,510
there's no pressure in the gym.

2266
00:56:52,511 --> 00:56:56,500
He could be himself and in the gym he
had been used to bullying Travis around.

2267
00:56:56,501 --> 00:56:59,590
Apparently he had been beaten Travis
up when they'd had sparring sessions.

2268
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:00,940
That was what the word was.

2269
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:03,940
So that when they'd gotten
into the octagon together,

2270
00:57:04,270 --> 00:57:05,380
like for everybody else,

2271
00:57:05,381 --> 00:57:05,741
it was like,

2272
00:57:05,741 --> 00:57:06,380
man,

2273
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:06,811
her laughs,

2274
00:57:06,811 --> 00:57:07,750
he's got a tough fight.

2275
00:57:07,751 --> 00:57:08,201
But for him,

2276
00:57:08,201 --> 00:57:09,034
he's like,

2277
00:57:09,110 --> 00:57:09,581
our spa,

2278
00:57:09,581 --> 00:57:10,720
this guy a hundred times,

2279
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:11,800
I'm going to go after him.

2280
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:16,030
And so they went after each other
and one point Travis had them down,

2281
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:16,841
man had him down.

2282
00:57:16,841 --> 00:57:18,580
It hurt bad and our laughs,

2283
00:57:18,581 --> 00:57:21,850
he came back from that and knocked him
out and like that was one of the craziest

2284
00:57:21,851 --> 00:57:23,360
rounds in heavyweight history.

2285
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,900
Can Matt necessarily say cool,

2286
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:26,561
wild,

2287
00:57:26,561 --> 00:57:30,550
wild round and then a Lusk guys in flights
and mia and I was expecting the same

2288
00:57:30,551 --> 00:57:31,970
Oleske liberal Kotlin St.

2289
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:35,830
I was expecting this same thing expecting
the same fireworks and unfortunately

2290
00:57:35,831 --> 00:57:36,130
there's a little,

2291
00:57:36,130 --> 00:57:41,020
it was a little bit of a look quite the
same enthusiasm in that one I think in

2292
00:57:41,021 --> 00:57:41,854
that fight.

2293
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,800
I think one of the things that happens
in really high pressure fights,

2294
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:49,510
and I think this correlates with what we
were talking earlier about pressure and

2295
00:57:49,511 --> 00:57:50,540
about like you,

2296
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:53,500
you know we were talking about guys
that put too much pressure on themselves

2297
00:57:53,501 --> 00:57:57,280
from shit talking and get too
much emotionally wrapped up in it.

2298
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:02,500
When a fight is a fight where they say
the winner is going to be the number one

2299
00:58:02,501 --> 00:58:03,210
contender,

2300
00:58:03,210 --> 00:58:04,470
we'll next fight for the title.

2301
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:09,310
Those fights suck at least 50% of the
time because at least 50% of the time

2302
00:58:09,311 --> 00:58:12,880
everybody locks up and nobody wants
to do anything stupid because a win

2303
00:58:13,330 --> 00:58:15,660
virtually guarantees you
a shot at the title yet.

2304
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:20,740
But the fight wasn't good because
neither guy pulled the trigger and it was

2305
00:58:20,741 --> 00:58:20,980
like,

2306
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:22,300
it was very lack luster.

2307
00:58:22,350 --> 00:58:24,580
It's like both guys
were like hesitant and,

2308
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,470
and even our Lawsky,

2309
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:28,690
even though he won the fight
when I was interviewing him,

2310
00:58:28,691 --> 00:58:29,680
he wasn't happy gay.

2311
00:58:29,681 --> 00:58:31,960
He was shaking his head and he
was devastated and he is crazy.

2312
00:58:31,961 --> 00:58:32,620
He won,

2313
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:33,131
he won.

2314
00:58:33,131 --> 00:58:33,700
He,

2315
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:35,950
he thought he was going to have
the next shot at the title,

2316
00:58:35,951 --> 00:58:36,611
but then you know,

2317
00:58:36,611 --> 00:58:38,230
then the fight was bad.

2318
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:41,500
So that's one of the weird things about
the UFC that people don't like is if

2319
00:58:41,501 --> 00:58:43,360
there isn't any like clear structure.

2320
00:58:43,361 --> 00:58:44,740
Like when Misha Tate one,

2321
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:48,400
she was virtually guaranteed
shot at the title beat Jessica.

2322
00:58:48,401 --> 00:58:49,710
I you got a shot at the title.

2323
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:50,381
She Be Jessica.

2324
00:58:50,381 --> 00:58:50,800
I was like,

2325
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:51,770
ah,

2326
00:58:51,850 --> 00:58:52,670
listen.

2327
00:58:52,670 --> 00:58:53,230
It's the price.

2328
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:54,063
It's not,

2329
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:54,971
you're not ready for that.

2330
00:58:54,971 --> 00:58:55,804
Like why?

2331
00:58:56,260 --> 00:58:57,093
So she's,

2332
00:58:57,310 --> 00:58:58,031
she's actually,

2333
00:58:58,031 --> 00:59:02,050
she made some interview recently where
she said that she should probably think

2334
00:59:02,051 --> 00:59:05,650
about what she's going to do when she
retires and she should probably at least

2335
00:59:05,651 --> 00:59:06,484
consider that.

2336
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:07,211
And I was like,

2337
00:59:07,211 --> 00:59:07,750
whoa.

2338
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:09,640
She's like thinking about retiring.

2339
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:13,810
And that's an interesting thing when
you look at the number one person in the

2340
00:59:13,811 --> 00:59:14,291
division,

2341
00:59:14,291 --> 00:59:15,520
which is clearly Rhonda,

2342
00:59:15,730 --> 00:59:16,750
who's made,

2343
00:59:16,990 --> 00:59:20,100
I think she may like $6 million
last year or $7 million,

2344
00:59:20,110 --> 00:59:21,070
something fucking crazy.

2345
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:21,650
That,

2346
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:22,760
and that's in fighting,

2347
00:59:22,970 --> 00:59:23,501
forgot about,

2348
00:59:23,501 --> 00:59:25,370
or all these ads she's doing,

2349
00:59:25,371 --> 00:59:27,290
she's in a million different
fucking commercials.

2350
00:59:27,290 --> 00:59:27,441
I mean,

2351
00:59:27,441 --> 00:59:32,441
she's probably made that much on top of
that with just ads and endorsements and

2352
00:59:32,931 --> 00:59:33,531
movies.

2353
00:59:33,531 --> 00:59:35,360
She's done two big movies.

2354
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:37,970
She's making fucking truckloads of money.

2355
00:59:37,971 --> 00:59:38,600
Right.

2356
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:39,530
And then there's Meisha Tate,

2357
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:41,840
who's the number two girl in the division,

2358
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:42,853
arguably.

2359
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:43,820
I mean,

2360
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:46,070
even though she's lost
to Ronda three times,

2361
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:48,140
she's the number two girl in the division,

2362
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:48,710
right?

2363
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:49,130
Yes.

2364
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:51,470
And how much do you think she makes?

2365
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:52,220
I mean it is,

2366
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:53,630
it's a fraction.

2367
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:54,613
A small,

2368
00:59:54,650 --> 00:59:55,790
as long as she's not hot,

2369
00:59:56,030 --> 00:59:57,110
she's hot as fuck.

2370
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,033
Right.

2371
00:59:58,070 --> 00:59:59,120
It's got beautiful body.

2372
01:00:00,690 --> 01:00:00,961
Sorry,

2373
01:00:00,961 --> 01:00:01,700
so that,

2374
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:02,533
sorry Misha.

2375
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:03,381
All due respect.

2376
01:00:03,381 --> 01:00:04,460
But she's a great fighter too.

2377
01:00:04,461 --> 01:00:05,300
She's very tough.

2378
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:07,910
I believe there's photos
of you at the Wayne plus.

2379
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:09,411
I don't know if it was her,

2380
01:00:09,411 --> 01:00:10,790
I think it was looking at Rhonda Zass.

2381
01:00:11,390 --> 01:00:12,223
I've looked at a few hours.

2382
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:13,863
He kept board.

2383
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:14,830
It's not a do,

2384
01:00:14,830 --> 01:00:17,510
I'm standing there in their underwear,

2385
01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:19,630
feet away from me not being a creek,

2386
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:20,780
just doing my job.

2387
01:00:22,150 --> 01:00:22,640
Um,

2388
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,030
but you know me,

2389
01:00:24,031 --> 01:00:25,910
shit probably makes it very,

2390
01:00:25,911 --> 01:00:28,190
very small fraction of what Rhonda makes.

2391
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:29,810
And she's elite.

2392
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:31,730
She's an outstanding fighter.

2393
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:33,110
She's tough as shit man.

2394
01:00:33,770 --> 01:00:34,640
And you know,

2395
01:00:34,730 --> 01:00:35,600
and people love her.

2396
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:36,463
It's weird.

2397
01:00:36,590 --> 01:00:37,400
Yeah.

2398
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,050
I believe she's been to the
movies and then as well.

2399
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:39,480
Yeah.

2400
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:41,160
His cyborg and Holly did that last one.

2401
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:41,300
I've,

2402
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:43,210
I'm on the Instagram and Facebook now,

2403
01:00:43,290 --> 01:00:44,810
but who's making that movie?

2404
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:46,130
Who's going to see that movie?

2405
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:47,331
What does that movie,

2406
01:00:47,331 --> 01:00:52,331
that movie some fucking 3:00 AM Cinemax
fucking Zombie movie chicken zombies

2407
01:00:52,851 --> 01:00:53,770
heads off or something.

2408
01:00:53,771 --> 01:00:54,260
And you know,

2409
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:55,400
it's like people,

2410
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:56,211
when people would tell me,

2411
01:00:56,211 --> 01:00:56,481
oh,

2412
01:00:56,481 --> 01:00:57,440
he's doing movies now.

2413
01:00:57,470 --> 01:00:58,303
I'm like,

2414
01:00:58,370 --> 01:00:58,641
look,

2415
01:00:58,641 --> 01:01:00,200
I know a lot of people doing movies.

2416
01:01:00,201 --> 01:01:01,640
Like what kind of movie?

2417
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:02,523
You know,

2418
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:08,440
Bj Penn did if a couple of movies and
we've and Gina Carano has done like,

2419
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:10,460
she's done some big
movies and she did that,

2420
01:01:10,461 --> 01:01:10,671
uh,

2421
01:01:10,671 --> 01:01:11,630
that one movie.

2422
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:12,700
What was that movie that he was,

2423
01:01:12,790 --> 01:01:13,910
she was a star Haywire.

2424
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:14,900
Nobody saw it.

2425
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:16,220
And then because nobody saw it,

2426
01:01:16,221 --> 01:01:17,270
nobody gave me shit about it.

2427
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:18,440
It faded away.

2428
01:01:18,441 --> 01:01:20,280
And then you don't hear about
her as a movie star anymore.

2429
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:20,990
I mean she was,

2430
01:01:20,990 --> 01:01:22,250
she was that close,

2431
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:27,580
that close to being this runaway train
movie star and this fast and the furious

2432
01:01:28,461 --> 01:01:30,430
and there's all the figures which she,

2433
01:01:30,470 --> 01:01:32,390
Rhonda was in that Rhonda
was in one of those.

2434
01:01:32,391 --> 01:01:32,870
Right.

2435
01:01:32,870 --> 01:01:34,810
And then also a Deadpool,

2436
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:35,540
I think that was coming out.

2437
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:39,740
She just got a major part hopefully
that my school I broke had a Korea.

2438
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:40,280
Oh,

2439
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:43,760
the ads for the or the previews
for Deadpool look bad out.

2440
01:01:43,761 --> 01:01:44,380
It's a tough,

2441
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:46,310
but my point is it's a tough racket.

2442
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:48,290
The movie business is a tough racket.

2443
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:48,580
Yeah,

2444
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:49,040
yeah,

2445
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:49,210
yeah.

2446
01:01:49,210 --> 01:01:52,100
I remember Frank shamrock
saying to be once like he's,

2447
01:01:52,101 --> 01:01:53,390
he said he was going to get into acting.

2448
01:01:53,390 --> 01:01:53,561
He said,

2449
01:01:53,561 --> 01:01:53,651
well,

2450
01:01:53,651 --> 01:01:55,790
I'm gonna take over the world of acting
the same way I took over the world of

2451
01:01:55,791 --> 01:01:56,061
fighting.

2452
01:01:56,061 --> 01:01:56,894
I'm like,

2453
01:01:57,020 --> 01:01:57,801
good luck with that,

2454
01:01:57,801 --> 01:01:58,540
dude did.

2455
01:01:58,540 --> 01:01:59,780
You can't even control that.

2456
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:03,510
It's not like you can run hills better
than anybody and kick people's asses that

2457
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:03,980
you're,

2458
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:04,701
when you're fighting,

2459
01:02:04,701 --> 01:02:05,840
you could be undeniable.

2460
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:06,710
You know,

2461
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:07,543
you were fighting,

2462
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:08,150
they,

2463
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:11,450
they lock you in that octagon or you
hop over the ropes into that ring.

2464
01:02:11,451 --> 01:02:13,580
And when the referee says fight,

2465
01:02:13,790 --> 01:02:15,470
there's nothing that can save that guy.

2466
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:16,041
You know,

2467
01:02:16,041 --> 01:02:18,860
you storm after him and knock him
out and you're the fucking king.

2468
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:21,270
But in the world of acting,

2469
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:22,680
my God,

2470
01:02:22,681 --> 01:02:25,410
there's so many hoops and
ladders and so much bullshit.

2471
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:27,420
And it doesn't matter if
you're the best from you,

2472
01:02:27,421 --> 01:02:28,450
you know exactly what's going on.

2473
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:29,820
You've sort of enough,

2474
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:30,720
I've done some acting,

2475
01:02:30,721 --> 01:02:34,590
but I've been very lucky to be like
on the outside of it all looking in,

2476
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:34,891
you know,

2477
01:02:34,891 --> 01:02:36,300
cause I was always a standup comic.

2478
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:38,880
I always had that as my real career.

2479
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:42,150
And then this acting thing was something
I did when they offered me money to do

2480
01:02:42,151 --> 01:02:42,550
it.

2481
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:44,820
If it's not something I
really chased after that much.

2482
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:47,310
And so when I watch other people
that were chasing after it,

2483
01:02:47,311 --> 01:02:47,911
I got to see,

2484
01:02:47,911 --> 01:02:48,121
look,

2485
01:02:48,121 --> 01:02:49,980
the psychological aspect of it,

2486
01:02:50,310 --> 01:02:54,030
you see people kissing people's asses
because you want everybody to like you

2487
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:57,930
because you want to get cast in these
movies and you got to make friends the

2488
01:02:57,931 --> 01:02:59,010
right social circles.

2489
01:02:59,011 --> 01:03:00,660
You gotta be in the right red carpets.

2490
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:02,370
You gotta support the right cause.

2491
01:03:02,371 --> 01:03:04,890
You have to have the right
political affiliations.

2492
01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:05,310
It's,

2493
01:03:05,310 --> 01:03:06,330
it's a mess,

2494
01:03:06,331 --> 01:03:06,660
man.

2495
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:07,920
It's a fucking mess.

2496
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:09,780
You can't say anything controversial.

2497
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:10,321
Can't,

2498
01:03:10,321 --> 01:03:12,000
can't do anything too fucked up.

2499
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:12,391
You know,

2500
01:03:12,391 --> 01:03:12,780
there's like,

2501
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:16,530
there's certain things you can get away
with as an athlete you can get away with

2502
01:03:16,531 --> 01:03:18,270
as an actor because if you did,

2503
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:18,931
they would just write,

2504
01:03:18,931 --> 01:03:21,330
unless you're like some
fucking Johnny Depp Style,

2505
01:03:21,331 --> 01:03:23,760
huge undeniable movie star,

2506
01:03:24,030 --> 01:03:25,140
you can get away with a lot of shit.

2507
01:03:25,350 --> 01:03:25,951
But that's just,

2508
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:27,000
you become undeniable.

2509
01:03:27,001 --> 01:03:28,380
You have so much fan base.

2510
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:28,651
Yeah,

2511
01:03:28,651 --> 01:03:29,340
he's already,

2512
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:30,960
he's already there so he
can do what he wants now.

2513
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:32,010
It doesn't matter.

2514
01:03:32,010 --> 01:03:33,060
But even like Tom Cruise,

2515
01:03:33,061 --> 01:03:34,830
Tom Cruise fucked up and he started,

2516
01:03:34,910 --> 01:03:35,310
uh,

2517
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:39,480
he did a bunch of wacky interviews where
he's talking about Brooke Shields and

2518
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:41,580
Scientology.

2519
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:42,130
Yeah.

2520
01:03:42,130 --> 01:03:44,700
And antidepressants had put
dude his fucking movies,

2521
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:45,141
tickets,

2522
01:03:45,141 --> 01:03:47,400
sales ditch dropped after that.

2523
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:50,160
And it took a while for them to rebound.

2524
01:03:50,161 --> 01:03:52,800
Took a couple of years to rebound.

2525
01:03:53,380 --> 01:03:54,360
Didn't help things at all.

2526
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:54,920
No,

2527
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:56,670
that's wacky fucking shit,

2528
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,000
dude.

2529
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:57,370
But this,

2530
01:03:57,370 --> 01:03:58,051
it's again,

2531
01:03:58,051 --> 01:04:00,030
it's that weird world of acting.

2532
01:04:00,031 --> 01:04:00,661
And you know,

2533
01:04:00,661 --> 01:04:03,900
when frank was telling me he was gonna
take over that world and my chooses,

2534
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:05,370
I mean,

2535
01:04:05,370 --> 01:04:06,181
not doubting you,

2536
01:04:06,181 --> 01:04:06,840
but good luck.

2537
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:07,290
Hey,

2538
01:04:07,290 --> 01:04:08,250
that's a fucking different.

2539
01:04:08,251 --> 01:04:09,900
What's not the same world.

2540
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:13,640
It's not like I'm going to take over the
world of being a marathon runner yet.

2541
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:13,831
Well,

2542
01:04:13,831 --> 01:04:15,220
no one can stop you there.

2543
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:15,410
The,

2544
01:04:15,410 --> 01:04:16,650
everybody's at the starting line.

2545
01:04:16,651 --> 01:04:17,070
Ready.

2546
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:17,520
Go.

2547
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,510
You get an equal shot.

2548
01:04:18,511 --> 01:04:19,560
You're running the same road.

2549
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:21,960
You're not running the same
road when you're acting.

2550
01:04:21,961 --> 01:04:22,794
Man.

2551
01:04:23,010 --> 01:04:26,100
Anybody ever talked to you about
doing some fucking karate movies?

2552
01:04:26,910 --> 01:04:27,580
John Wayne,

2553
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:29,250
Paulette style kicks in,

2554
01:04:29,251 --> 01:04:29,840
movies.

2555
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:29,990
Uh,

2556
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:30,171
we've,

2557
01:04:30,171 --> 01:04:31,940
we've dabbled of affection but,

2558
01:04:32,270 --> 01:04:33,120
and leave for free.

2559
01:04:33,121 --> 01:04:36,150
But now he just like shorts for
the Youtube but nothing for fun,

2560
01:04:36,270 --> 01:04:36,781
just for fun.

2561
01:04:36,781 --> 01:04:38,760
Yay Australian stuff or American stuff.

2562
01:04:38,790 --> 01:04:39,211
Uh,

2563
01:04:39,211 --> 01:04:42,390
after I did the documentary of the bus
event and we played around a little bit

2564
01:04:42,391 --> 01:04:45,350
and then we went to Thailand and then
I was lucky enough to work with the,

2565
01:04:45,351 --> 01:04:47,580
some Thai stuntman and a,

2566
01:04:47,581 --> 01:04:51,720
they'd work with a tiny jar and it
was nice to get you guys credible.

2567
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:54,430
Say they stopped him that
well I got to work with um,

2568
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:54,980
you,

2569
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:56,280
you had thrown an inch,

2570
01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:00,660
a punched and each pass their face and
they literally throw themselves back 10

2571
01:05:00,661 --> 01:05:02,280
feet onto concrete unto thee,

2572
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:03,173
unto their back,

2573
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:04,200
you think.

2574
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:04,480
And then,

2575
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:05,900
and then they lay their eggs,

2576
01:05:06,330 --> 01:05:07,780
they laid a Dade for three seconds,

2577
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:08,440
open their eyes,

2578
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:08,940
okay,

2579
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:09,401
do it again.

2580
01:05:09,401 --> 01:05:10,950
And this time we're going
to cut it in a bit shorter.

2581
01:05:11,310 --> 01:05:13,050
And then the term stuff again and again,

2582
01:05:13,051 --> 01:05:14,610
and they can't really know how to fall,

2583
01:05:14,611 --> 01:05:14,970
man.

2584
01:05:14,970 --> 01:05:15,750
Shit,

2585
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:16,590
this isn't the,

2586
01:05:16,591 --> 01:05:17,860
I have to now they sell it,

2587
01:05:17,890 --> 01:05:18,040
they

2588
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,210
make it look amazing.

2589
01:05:19,211 --> 01:05:19,540
It's like,

2590
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:20,830
I mean the guys who far you get,

2591
01:05:20,831 --> 01:05:22,980
they've got to really know how
to fall in up for themselves.

2592
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:23,201
That's,

2593
01:05:23,201 --> 01:05:23,561
yeah,

2594
01:05:23,561 --> 01:05:24,570
a different different league.

2595
01:05:24,571 --> 01:05:25,404
It's like,

2596
01:05:25,710 --> 01:05:25,980
yeah,

2597
01:05:25,980 --> 01:05:27,790
I'd rather punch someone
in the faces letter.

2598
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:31,900
I'd rather make my money free bottlers
instead of pretending to be violent.

2599
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:34,540
And the documentary that you were talking
about it people didn't understand you

2600
01:05:34,541 --> 01:05:35,980
through your thick Aussie accent,

2601
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:41,240
blessed with venom and it's a great
documentary and it details your life and

2602
01:05:42,161 --> 01:05:46,900
learning Moyie Thai and moving to Thailand
and living there and fighting there.

2603
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:49,450
And it's really cool documentary man.

2604
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:50,120
Thanks you.

2605
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:50,410
Uh,

2606
01:05:50,410 --> 01:05:52,240
so many people were
messaging me and saying,

2607
01:05:52,241 --> 01:05:56,410
Jared and sent me here in the youtube
comments saying thank you very much for

2608
01:05:56,411 --> 01:05:56,860
the,

2609
01:05:56,860 --> 01:05:58,870
for the Joe Rogan a the great documentary.

2610
01:05:58,871 --> 01:05:59,380
So it's,

2611
01:05:59,380 --> 01:05:59,571
it's,

2612
01:05:59,571 --> 01:06:00,404
it's uh,

2613
01:06:00,730 --> 01:06:00,940
uh,

2614
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:01,511
saying before,

2615
01:06:01,511 --> 01:06:03,010
like when I got released in Australia,

2616
01:06:03,070 --> 01:06:04,780
it was lucky enough to be open in cinemas.

2617
01:06:05,230 --> 01:06:06,850
So we had cinema release and then,

2618
01:06:06,851 --> 01:06:07,181
yeah,

2619
01:06:07,181 --> 01:06:08,050
it just went nowhere.

2620
01:06:08,051 --> 01:06:09,160
So it's on youtube now.

2621
01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:09,861
So it'd be,

2622
01:06:09,861 --> 01:06:11,580
I want to have a look a bit of a bit,

2623
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:12,453
not only about,

2624
01:06:12,470 --> 01:06:12,940
uh,

2625
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:13,810
my career,

2626
01:06:13,811 --> 01:06:15,640
but also about Thai culture.

2627
01:06:15,820 --> 01:06:16,830
So I nausea,

2628
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:20,530
going to Thailand and learning the Tai
Customs and culture and learning how to

2629
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:23,290
speak Thai and eating
on the floor and sleep,

2630
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:26,860
sleeping on the wooden floor
and training seven hours a day.

2631
01:06:26,861 --> 01:06:27,694
It's pretty.

2632
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:28,990
And then fighting the killers too.

2633
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:31,120
I wasn't just going in there and
make it up and nothing numbers.

2634
01:06:31,130 --> 01:06:35,320
I was lucky enough to sat at the bottom
and then work my way up to winning two

2635
01:06:35,321 --> 01:06:36,220
world titles in Bangkok.

2636
01:06:36,221 --> 01:06:36,651
So it's,

2637
01:06:36,651 --> 01:06:36,781
it's,

2638
01:06:36,781 --> 01:06:37,331
it's a,

2639
01:06:37,331 --> 01:06:38,200
it's a happy ending.

2640
01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:42,970
It's a fascinating documentary too
because like culturally it's such a,

2641
01:06:43,090 --> 01:06:48,090
it's such a unique thing for someone to
do to immerse themselves in the world of

2642
01:06:49,931 --> 01:06:53,860
the tie and have these more tie fighters
and live like they live and train like

2643
01:06:53,861 --> 01:06:54,520
they live.

2644
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:57,190
And a guy coming from Australia
and moving there and doing that,

2645
01:06:57,191 --> 01:06:57,491
it's like,

2646
01:06:57,491 --> 01:06:58,180
uh,

2647
01:06:58,180 --> 01:06:58,560
it's,

2648
01:06:58,560 --> 01:06:58,840
it's,

2649
01:06:58,840 --> 01:06:59,261
it's always,

2650
01:06:59,261 --> 01:06:59,591
to me,

2651
01:06:59,591 --> 01:07:02,980
amazing to watch someone
just enter into a world.

2652
01:07:02,981 --> 01:07:04,870
It's so completely different than theirs.

2653
01:07:04,871 --> 01:07:05,311
And you,

2654
01:07:05,311 --> 01:07:09,490
you barely had a grasp at all
of the language and you know,

2655
01:07:09,491 --> 01:07:14,491
you're training with these guys that have
been essentially preparing for fights

2656
01:07:14,861 --> 01:07:15,730
the way they have,

2657
01:07:15,820 --> 01:07:19,420
the way they did it with you for hundreds
and hundreds of years before you were

2658
01:07:19,421 --> 01:07:20,254
ever born.

2659
01:07:20,310 --> 01:07:20,680
Yeah.

2660
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:20,891
It's,

2661
01:07:20,891 --> 01:07:21,340
um,

2662
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:22,510
and then what happened was,

2663
01:07:22,690 --> 01:07:26,290
so say I've moved into this
camp and there's about 10,

2664
01:07:26,350 --> 01:07:27,880
10 fighters there and then,

2665
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:29,140
uh,

2666
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:29,970
one night,

2667
01:07:29,970 --> 01:07:30,080
uh,

2668
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:30,791
I've had my flight,

2669
01:07:30,791 --> 01:07:31,300
I've won,

2670
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:33,430
I've gone to a patio with all
the westerners hanging out,

2671
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:34,180
uh,

2672
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:37,120
for a week's holiday and I've come back
and all the other kids that had run

2673
01:07:37,121 --> 01:07:37,954
away.

2674
01:07:37,990 --> 01:07:39,700
So then there was only
me and the superstar.

2675
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:40,240
So,

2676
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:43,570
and now that I was giving them 50%
of my prize money after every flight,

2677
01:07:43,870 --> 01:07:45,240
so now it was in the camps,

2678
01:07:45,250 --> 01:07:47,770
best interest to try and make
me as as good as I could,

2679
01:07:47,771 --> 01:07:51,280
as fast as I could so I could win more
fights and make more prize money so they

2680
01:07:51,281 --> 01:07:52,630
get 50% more income.

2681
01:07:53,590 --> 01:07:54,460
The only way that could,

2682
01:07:54,550 --> 01:07:58,090
the only way they could survive is for
me to become the best that I could so

2683
01:07:58,091 --> 01:07:59,230
they could get more money,

2684
01:07:59,231 --> 01:08:00,064
if that makes sense.

2685
01:08:00,070 --> 01:08:00,281
Yeah,

2686
01:08:00,281 --> 01:08:00,570
it does.

2687
01:08:00,570 --> 01:08:02,710
That's what a fortuitous
roll the dice for.

2688
01:08:02,711 --> 01:08:04,690
You say I was showing the under the,

2689
01:08:04,990 --> 01:08:05,531
under the bus,

2690
01:08:05,531 --> 01:08:07,080
but until the little grinder,

2691
01:08:07,090 --> 01:08:07,601
looking back,

2692
01:08:07,601 --> 01:08:08,140
looking back,

2693
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:10,870
it was like the biggest blessing that
could happen because if there was 50

2694
01:08:10,871 --> 01:08:11,180
people,

2695
01:08:11,180 --> 01:08:13,180
then I would have been
stuck in a bag by myself.

2696
01:08:13,181 --> 01:08:15,220
But because I was only
me and the superstar,

2697
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:16,220
uh,

2698
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:18,520
and then the supersize sancton noise,

2699
01:08:18,530 --> 01:08:19,700
the he had no,

2700
01:08:19,701 --> 01:08:20,260
what's his name?

2701
01:08:20,260 --> 01:08:20,660
Uh,

2702
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:22,450
he's fighting was the deadly kisser.

2703
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:23,730
The deadly kiss.

2704
01:08:23,740 --> 01:08:24,231
Her kiss her.

2705
01:08:24,231 --> 01:08:25,064
So why is that?

2706
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:27,110
Because there's so much
gambling in Thailand.

2707
01:08:27,111 --> 01:08:29,630
So if he thought he was beating his
opponent at the end of the round,

2708
01:08:29,631 --> 01:08:31,730
he'd give him a kiss on the cheek
and that will show the punters,

2709
01:08:31,970 --> 01:08:32,301
okay,

2710
01:08:32,301 --> 01:08:32,900
I've got this.

2711
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:33,800
So that all bid on him,

2712
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:35,060
a little Betty and say,

2713
01:08:35,061 --> 01:08:35,930
if you're being kissed by him,

2714
01:08:35,931 --> 01:08:36,920
it means he's kicked your ass.

2715
01:08:38,230 --> 01:08:42,260
Say you did the deadly Kisa opponents
know this nickname was the deadly killer

2716
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:42,711
if they,

2717
01:08:42,711 --> 01:08:43,400
if they get,

2718
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:43,670
yeah,

2719
01:08:43,670 --> 01:08:45,230
because after the round that Ding,

2720
01:08:45,231 --> 01:08:46,850
he'd walk up and just give
you a kiss on the cheek.

2721
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:47,770
And they were like,

2722
01:08:47,780 --> 01:08:48,710
what the fuck man,

2723
01:08:48,711 --> 01:08:49,850
you not kicking my ass.

2724
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:51,860
Fuck fat people trying to take away.

2725
01:08:51,861 --> 01:08:53,390
They try to move away from the kiss.

2726
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:54,300
I ran a deca heat.

2727
01:08:54,301 --> 01:08:56,900
Did he for decker three
times because like,

2728
01:08:56,901 --> 01:08:57,681
no,

2729
01:08:57,681 --> 01:09:00,490
get away from me and get those
filthy lips away from her.

2730
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:04,910
So how did the fights
go with him and decker?

2731
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:05,400
Uh,

2732
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:05,871
it was two.

2733
01:09:05,871 --> 01:09:06,970
One DECA,

2734
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:07,851
Deca one,

2735
01:09:07,851 --> 01:09:08,361
the last one.

2736
01:09:08,361 --> 01:09:09,520
Now I'm saying 10 when the first two.

2737
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:10,510
The first one was Japan,

2738
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:11,460
the second one was on Piney,

2739
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:12,470
the third one was in Holland.

2740
01:09:12,830 --> 01:09:13,090
Uh,

2741
01:09:13,090 --> 01:09:13,521
it was very,

2742
01:09:13,521 --> 01:09:14,031
very close.

2743
01:09:14,031 --> 01:09:14,570
But um,

2744
01:09:14,570 --> 01:09:14,821
yeah,

2745
01:09:14,821 --> 01:09:15,890
decker was a same thing,

2746
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:16,671
was about 36,

2747
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:17,151
37.

2748
01:09:17,151 --> 01:09:18,630
It's like me versus cosmo now.

2749
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:20,470
Dang thing was a little older.

2750
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:21,710
Decker was still in his prime,

2751
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:25,100
so he finally got one
into anytime country.

2752
01:09:25,101 --> 01:09:26,060
Lowe's live and tight,

2753
01:09:26,150 --> 01:09:27,620
tight TV and Dutch TV.

2754
01:09:27,621 --> 01:09:30,260
So there again making decker the,

2755
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:33,260
the legend that is and how
old was decker at the time?

2756
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:33,580
Ah,

2757
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:35,510
possibly about 34 35.

2758
01:09:35,870 --> 01:09:36,703
Um,

2759
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:37,490
but yeah,

2760
01:09:37,490 --> 01:09:39,190
it was towards the end
of his run to right.

2761
01:09:39,330 --> 01:09:40,010
It was,

2762
01:09:40,010 --> 01:09:41,120
he had a heart attack.

2763
01:09:41,121 --> 01:09:42,920
He was only like 42 or 43.

2764
01:09:42,921 --> 01:09:43,221
Right.

2765
01:09:43,221 --> 01:09:44,000
44,

2766
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:44,700
44.

2767
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:45,500
Four in a park.

2768
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:46,970
That's what a fuck man.

2769
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:48,361
How crazy.

2770
01:09:48,361 --> 01:09:49,550
He was riding his bike.

2771
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:49,751
Right.

2772
01:09:49,751 --> 01:09:52,010
And he's working at
Dutch park and then um,

2773
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:52,431
yeah,

2774
01:09:52,431 --> 01:09:54,950
he has a memorial ed
where they come in later,

2775
01:09:54,951 --> 01:09:56,220
heaps of flowers and I think,

2776
01:09:56,221 --> 01:09:57,930
damn that they have spray painted the,

2777
01:09:57,950 --> 01:10:01,580
the little tunnel that is with
a big memorial of Dick Decker.

2778
01:10:01,581 --> 01:10:01,970
And it's,

2779
01:10:01,970 --> 01:10:02,720
it's um,

2780
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:03,553
it's very,

2781
01:10:04,150 --> 01:10:04,540
uh,

2782
01:10:04,540 --> 01:10:07,730
what a crazy way to go
for a world class athlete.

2783
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:08,780
World Championship.

2784
01:10:08,860 --> 01:10:10,310
Kickboxer riding a bike.

2785
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:10,790
Yeah.

2786
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:12,830
And at a relatively young age.

2787
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:13,101
Yeah.

2788
01:10:13,101 --> 01:10:14,060
He was the king weekend.

2789
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:17,630
He came to Australia and he hung out with
me at my gym because he was fighting a

2790
01:10:17,631 --> 01:10:18,021
friend of mine,

2791
01:10:18,021 --> 01:10:18,710
he was fighting,

2792
01:10:18,710 --> 01:10:19,170
he had a,

2793
01:10:19,170 --> 01:10:20,570
he was training a guy that was fighting,

2794
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:21,463
fighting Nathan.

2795
01:10:21,530 --> 01:10:23,660
So they needed someone to
train for the week to prepare.

2796
01:10:23,990 --> 01:10:25,160
So I was lucky enough they,

2797
01:10:25,170 --> 01:10:25,911
the promoter rang me,

2798
01:10:25,911 --> 01:10:26,091
said,

2799
01:10:26,091 --> 01:10:26,150
hey,

2800
01:10:26,150 --> 01:10:28,460
do you mind if rain and wind comes
and trains at your gym for a week?

2801
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:28,791
It's like,

2802
01:10:28,791 --> 01:10:29,000
oh,

2803
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:29,833
yes.

2804
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:30,171
So,

2805
01:10:30,171 --> 01:10:30,890
um,

2806
01:10:30,890 --> 01:10:31,251
yeah,

2807
01:10:31,251 --> 01:10:33,690
I hung out with the
morning and night and like,

2808
01:10:34,910 --> 01:10:35,960
just the dude,

2809
01:10:35,990 --> 01:10:36,980
he was just a,

2810
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:37,893
an animal.

2811
01:10:38,050 --> 01:10:38,401
Uh,

2812
01:10:38,401 --> 01:10:39,620
and so many stories like me,

2813
01:10:39,621 --> 01:10:42,440
I knew I could just sit here
and just listen to you all day,

2814
01:10:42,441 --> 01:10:43,370
like a little school boy,

2815
01:10:43,371 --> 01:10:44,510
just asking stories,

2816
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:45,473
what's about this?

2817
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:46,573
What about that fight?

2818
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:47,420
Do you have any injuries?

2819
01:10:47,421 --> 01:10:48,720
And then he'd just go on it.

2820
01:10:48,721 --> 01:10:49,554
He just,

2821
01:10:49,710 --> 01:10:50,391
it was,

2822
01:10:50,391 --> 01:10:50,720
um,

2823
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:53,450
just a little boy just
listening to greatness.

2824
01:10:53,770 --> 01:10:54,610
So it was,

2825
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:54,981
it was,

2826
01:10:54,981 --> 01:10:55,550
um,

2827
01:10:55,550 --> 01:10:56,331
it was really cool.

2828
01:10:56,331 --> 01:10:58,620
He gave me a pair of shorts
that I have up on my gym that a,

2829
01:10:58,621 --> 01:10:59,750
I'm so proud of,

2830
01:11:00,470 --> 01:11:02,000
important and multiple times in.

2831
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:02,870
Uh,

2832
01:11:02,870 --> 01:11:03,800
but yeah,

2833
01:11:03,810 --> 01:11:04,071
just,

2834
01:11:04,071 --> 01:11:04,340
um,

2835
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:05,173
the wars,

2836
01:11:05,330 --> 01:11:08,270
he's a [inaudible] pretty much.

2837
01:11:08,271 --> 01:11:08,990
He was in first,

2838
01:11:08,990 --> 01:11:10,520
the first one to put it on the map,

2839
01:11:10,550 --> 01:11:14,160
the to say look there
a possibility for white

2840
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:18,020
people to beat ties it their own sport
in Thailand at the big stadiums and that

2841
01:11:18,021 --> 01:11:20,280
not only wind but knock him
out in devastating fashion.

2842
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:23,220
So his style was so aggressive to God.

2843
01:11:23,221 --> 01:11:24,480
It was so exciting to watch.

2844
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:26,160
He's one of my all time favorites.

2845
01:11:26,161 --> 01:11:27,180
And then rob came in.

2846
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:29,970
It was different because
rob was a bigger guy.

2847
01:11:30,010 --> 01:11:30,290
Yes,

2848
01:11:30,290 --> 01:11:31,110
yes.

2849
01:11:31,110 --> 01:11:32,400
But very technical.

2850
01:11:32,430 --> 01:11:32,941
God,

2851
01:11:32,941 --> 01:11:33,840
he has such a system.

2852
01:11:33,841 --> 01:11:38,520
I had the honor of training with him
quite a bit and he's so technical man,

2853
01:11:38,521 --> 01:11:39,151
his system,

2854
01:11:39,151 --> 01:11:40,850
he has such a system for,

2855
01:11:40,870 --> 01:11:42,030
for a Muay Thai,

2856
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:42,271
you know,

2857
01:11:42,271 --> 01:11:43,081
for kickboxing,

2858
01:11:43,081 --> 01:11:45,760
for putting combinations
together and you know,

2859
01:11:45,761 --> 01:11:47,520
and placement and movement.

2860
01:11:47,521 --> 01:11:49,650
And he's a fucking interesting guy.

2861
01:11:49,651 --> 01:11:50,281
Rob came in,

2862
01:11:50,281 --> 01:11:50,461
Matt,

2863
01:11:50,461 --> 01:11:51,570
very interesting guy.

2864
01:11:51,690 --> 01:11:55,110
It was hard for him to get the same
accolades as Raymond because Raymond was

2865
01:11:55,111 --> 01:11:58,050
fighting the ties at their most craziest,

2866
01:11:58,051 --> 01:12:03,051
wait that [inaudible] 63 to 61 to 63 so
whereas whereas you say that you mean

2867
01:12:03,841 --> 01:12:04,381
kilos,

2868
01:12:04,381 --> 01:12:05,400
which is like what does that work?

2869
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:07,610
One 35 one 40 or something like that

2870
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:10,350
and then a where's where's,

2871
01:12:10,351 --> 01:12:12,870
rob was a little bit bigger when he was
fighting and toys a little bit smaller.

2872
01:12:12,871 --> 01:12:13,920
So he was knocking them out.

2873
01:12:13,950 --> 01:12:16,670
But at the same time he should have been
knocking him out because he does it.

2874
01:12:17,130 --> 01:12:19,380
And then when you're fighting western
of US western or you're not going to get

2875
01:12:19,381 --> 01:12:21,120
the same worldwide sorta.

2876
01:12:21,810 --> 01:12:26,810
Whereas Raymond was his fighting like the
pure killers at a day at their weight.

2877
01:12:27,451 --> 01:12:29,550
And I'm not just beating
him but knocking them out.

2878
01:12:29,610 --> 01:12:29,821
So,

2879
01:12:29,821 --> 01:12:30,940
and then when the Po,

2880
01:12:30,990 --> 01:12:34,180
when the tires are paying attention and
the country stopping to watch a western

2881
01:12:34,181 --> 01:12:35,300
or come to their country to,

2882
01:12:35,310 --> 01:12:35,970
to,

2883
01:12:35,970 --> 01:12:37,320
to knock out their their best,

2884
01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:38,400
then you know you've made it.

2885
01:12:38,770 --> 01:12:39,210
Yeah.

2886
01:12:39,210 --> 01:12:41,520
He was a real phenomenon and for,

2887
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:46,410
and that's one of those things that
for people that don't know the sport or

2888
01:12:46,411 --> 01:12:47,370
aren't aware of it,

2889
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:52,350
like you can go right now to youtube and
go on a journey through the world of,

2890
01:12:52,710 --> 01:12:55,800
of one of the greatest
combat sport athletes ever.

2891
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:58,350
And Ramon Dekkers has so
many fights on youtube.

2892
01:12:58,620 --> 01:13:01,080
You can go and watch them and you'll
understand what we're talking about when

2893
01:13:01,081 --> 01:13:04,980
you just watch to that guy just slam
those kicks in and the attack with a

2894
01:13:04,981 --> 01:13:06,780
barrage of beautiful punches.

2895
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:08,880
He was a monster and the monster,

2896
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:12,540
these pressure to hidden push guys
into the corner on unto the ropes.

2897
01:13:12,570 --> 01:13:16,740
And then it wouldn't matter if he got
hit 14 times in the way and he just give

2898
01:13:16,741 --> 01:13:17,574
me one,

2899
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:18,570
give me one bang,

2900
01:13:18,571 --> 01:13:18,960
Bang,

2901
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:19,300
Bang,

2902
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:20,280
and then boom,

2903
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,900
and then just knock him out unconscious.

2904
01:13:21,950 --> 01:13:23,580
My style is so hard.

2905
01:13:23,610 --> 01:13:25,110
It was such a hard style.

2906
01:13:25,140 --> 01:13:25,320
He,

2907
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:26,810
he did a seminar at my gym.

2908
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:27,181
It was,

2909
01:13:27,181 --> 01:13:27,450
um,

2910
01:13:27,450 --> 01:13:27,751
he said,

2911
01:13:27,751 --> 01:13:29,250
just have three or four of us.

2912
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,210
We just keep it tiny.

2913
01:13:30,211 --> 01:13:31,170
We just keep it really small.

2914
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:32,033
That's what he wanted.

2915
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:33,660
The emir four person seminar,

2916
01:13:33,661 --> 01:13:34,290
he didn't want,

2917
01:13:34,290 --> 01:13:36,120
he didn't want the big 100 people.

2918
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:36,481
He just said,

2919
01:13:36,481 --> 01:13:36,651
good,

2920
01:13:36,651 --> 01:13:38,430
let's keep it six people max.

2921
01:13:38,550 --> 01:13:39,361
Wow.

2922
01:13:39,361 --> 01:13:39,661
He said,

2923
01:13:39,661 --> 01:13:41,610
let's keep it an odd
number so I can join in.

2924
01:13:42,090 --> 01:13:47,090
So many took it turns the gun at one
by one with this and then he'd say,

2925
01:13:47,551 --> 01:13:47,761
okay,

2926
01:13:47,761 --> 01:13:48,331
put your hands up.

2927
01:13:48,331 --> 01:13:49,890
I'm going to demonstrate a demonstration.

2928
01:13:50,610 --> 01:13:51,410
And he'd go,

2929
01:13:51,410 --> 01:13:51,751
one,

2930
01:13:51,751 --> 01:13:53,820
two Hook Lake and then you think,

2931
01:13:53,830 --> 01:13:55,800
and he's going to tap and it's like boom,

2932
01:13:55,801 --> 01:13:56,101
boom,

2933
01:13:56,101 --> 01:13:58,480
boom and then chop and
then your eyes would go,

2934
01:13:58,560 --> 01:13:59,250
bink,

2935
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:00,240
what the hell was that?

2936
01:14:00,660 --> 01:14:03,690
And then it sort of
look at me as if it was,

2937
01:14:04,150 --> 01:14:06,180
he was shocked that he hit me so hard.

2938
01:14:06,270 --> 01:14:07,500
It my reaction.

2939
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:07,951
He goes,

2940
01:14:07,951 --> 01:14:08,730
what?

2941
01:14:08,730 --> 01:14:08,950
I said,

2942
01:14:08,950 --> 01:14:09,571
ah yeah,

2943
01:14:09,571 --> 01:14:10,404
that was crazy.

2944
01:14:10,410 --> 01:14:10,740
He goes,

2945
01:14:10,740 --> 01:14:11,320
Oh,

2946
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:12,340
in Holland this is normal.

2947
01:14:12,610 --> 01:14:13,421
This is what we do.

2948
01:14:13,421 --> 01:14:14,980
Because on the ring there's no surprises.

2949
01:14:14,981 --> 01:14:16,900
So if we train like this on the ring,

2950
01:14:16,910 --> 01:14:17,890
this isn't an,

2951
01:14:17,891 --> 01:14:18,551
I'm just looking at him,

2952
01:14:18,551 --> 01:14:19,780
gone to,

2953
01:14:20,230 --> 01:14:22,690
there is no way in hell I'd
like to train with like this.

2954
01:14:23,350 --> 01:14:26,140
Especially everyday for a couple
of hours every single day.

2955
01:14:26,141 --> 01:14:28,810
They'd be detrimental to
them through my health.

2956
01:14:29,380 --> 01:14:32,650
Well ultimately is do you think that
that's part of what broke him down?

2957
01:14:32,651 --> 01:14:33,610
Like as he got older,

2958
01:14:33,611 --> 01:14:35,980
like he was devastated.

2959
01:14:35,981 --> 01:14:37,570
Like physically by the time he was done,

2960
01:14:37,571 --> 01:14:38,560
his ankles were gone.

2961
01:14:38,650 --> 01:14:39,040
Yeah,

2962
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:39,551
possibly.

2963
01:14:39,551 --> 01:14:40,061
Possibly.

2964
01:14:40,061 --> 01:14:43,450
And I think you've got to the stage where
he's buddy was so destroyed where he

2965
01:14:43,451 --> 01:14:44,231
can only do pads.

2966
01:14:44,231 --> 01:14:44,861
He couldn't even,

2967
01:14:44,861 --> 01:14:45,160
um,

2968
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:46,240
I don't think you would spa.

2969
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:47,620
I remember him telling us at lunch,

2970
01:14:47,621 --> 01:14:47,891
he said,

2971
01:14:47,891 --> 01:14:48,041
hey,

2972
01:14:48,041 --> 01:14:48,761
I just do pads,

2973
01:14:48,761 --> 01:14:49,001
pads,

2974
01:14:49,001 --> 01:14:49,301
pads,

2975
01:14:49,301 --> 01:14:49,780
and then was,

2976
01:14:49,780 --> 01:14:50,080
and again,

2977
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:51,190
because he was fighting so regularly,

2978
01:14:51,191 --> 01:14:54,250
he didn't have the spy because he was
following up with possibly every two weeks

2979
01:14:54,251 --> 01:14:54,581
or so.

2980
01:14:54,581 --> 01:14:55,750
So yeah,

2981
01:14:55,751 --> 01:14:56,081
he was,

2982
01:14:56,081 --> 01:14:56,650
um,

2983
01:14:56,650 --> 01:14:57,120
yeah,

2984
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:57,670
I did sit,

2985
01:14:57,670 --> 01:15:00,560
that's the eternal debate because like in,

2986
01:15:00,561 --> 01:15:01,750
in MMA as well,

2987
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:03,310
Joe Duffy was supposed to be fighting.

2988
01:15:03,310 --> 01:15:08,260
Dustin poray this past weekend in
Ireland in a huge card in Dublin,

2989
01:15:08,290 --> 01:15:09,700
sold out in like an hour,

2990
01:15:09,730 --> 01:15:11,890
just Irish love fights.

2991
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:12,460
Right.

2992
01:15:12,460 --> 01:15:13,540
And Joe Duffys,

2993
01:15:13,570 --> 01:15:15,430
the last guy to beat Conor McGregor,

2994
01:15:15,730 --> 01:15:16,720
and he's an Irishman.

2995
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:18,610
So everybody's excited to see him.

2996
01:15:18,940 --> 01:15:20,620
The Saturday before the fight,

2997
01:15:20,621 --> 01:15:21,580
a week before the fight,

2998
01:15:21,581 --> 01:15:22,510
he gets a concussion,

2999
01:15:22,690 --> 01:15:23,940
a yeah.

3000
01:15:23,950 --> 01:15:24,371
Sparring,

3001
01:15:24,371 --> 01:15:25,181
hard sparring,

3002
01:15:25,181 --> 01:15:26,170
hard going out for it,

3003
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:26,740
you know,

3004
01:15:26,740 --> 01:15:27,460
and um,

3005
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:28,330
they pull out of the fight.

3006
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:31,000
So he pulls out of the
fight the week of tried to,

3007
01:15:31,030 --> 01:15:31,361
you know,

3008
01:15:31,361 --> 01:15:31,551
they,

3009
01:15:31,551 --> 01:15:34,180
they gave him some examinations and
the doctor looked at him and said,

3010
01:15:34,181 --> 01:15:35,014
listen man,

3011
01:15:35,170 --> 01:15:35,441
you,

3012
01:15:35,441 --> 01:15:36,370
you got fucked up.

3013
01:15:36,371 --> 01:15:38,500
Like you need a lot of time off.

3014
01:15:38,501 --> 01:15:39,700
You need a few months off,

3015
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:40,570
you can't fight.

3016
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:40,840
Yeah.

3017
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:42,670
Accounting backwards from 10 apple,

3018
01:15:42,730 --> 01:15:43,500
orange,

3019
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:44,333
lemon.

3020
01:15:45,930 --> 01:15:47,500
So when you,

3021
01:15:48,190 --> 01:15:49,480
that's the eternal debate.

3022
01:15:49,510 --> 01:15:52,330
Do you spar like the Dutch,

3023
01:15:52,331 --> 01:15:53,830
do you fucking go crazy?

3024
01:15:53,831 --> 01:15:56,290
Like Melvin Manhoef and Mike's gym,

3025
01:15:56,530 --> 01:15:57,100
you know,

3026
01:15:57,100 --> 01:15:58,390
you just fucking attack,

3027
01:15:58,391 --> 01:15:58,781
attack,

3028
01:15:58,781 --> 01:16:02,140
attack and just take your lumps
and deal with it and just,

3029
01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:03,310
and then when you fight,

3030
01:16:03,311 --> 01:16:07,510
you will fight like that because you
finally that all the time or do you take a

3031
01:16:07,511 --> 01:16:08,800
more intelligent approach?

3032
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:10,510
Like many fighters do,

3033
01:16:10,511 --> 01:16:13,090
like the ties to where they
spar and they don't spar harder.

3034
01:16:13,091 --> 01:16:13,860
All right.

3035
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:14,321
All the toys.

3036
01:16:14,321 --> 01:16:15,610
Then even when I first got there,

3037
01:16:15,611 --> 01:16:17,350
there was no shin pads or,

3038
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:18,273
um,

3039
01:16:18,470 --> 01:16:18,750
yeah,

3040
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:19,360
it was nice.

3041
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:19,811
It was just,

3042
01:16:19,811 --> 01:16:20,080
it was,

3043
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:21,520
and then you'd could
almost sweat bag meets,

3044
01:16:21,521 --> 01:16:21,671
you know,

3045
01:16:21,671 --> 01:16:22,250
it's just te,

3046
01:16:22,250 --> 01:16:22,490
te,

3047
01:16:22,490 --> 01:16:22,710
te,

3048
01:16:22,710 --> 01:16:23,200
Te,

3049
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:26,460
and then you're just working
on movement nation peds,

3050
01:16:26,461 --> 01:16:27,760
Amy Shit on Shane.

3051
01:16:27,761 --> 01:16:28,511
It's still be fast.

3052
01:16:28,511 --> 01:16:29,430
And then you pull out that light,

3053
01:16:29,470 --> 01:16:30,071
like karate,

3054
01:16:30,071 --> 01:16:31,190
letting put karate style,

3055
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:32,740
but there was Thai boxing and then,

3056
01:16:32,741 --> 01:16:33,130
um,

3057
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:33,990
you still know if he got,

3058
01:16:33,991 --> 01:16:34,200
got,

3059
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:34,530
got,

3060
01:16:34,530 --> 01:16:35,520
got or not say if,

3061
01:16:35,810 --> 01:16:36,060
uh,

3062
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:37,180
the Shin Land and across your ribs,

3063
01:16:37,181 --> 01:16:37,860
it'd be pulled.

3064
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:38,693
We just a tap.

3065
01:16:39,820 --> 01:16:40,211
And then,

3066
01:16:40,211 --> 01:16:40,840
um,

3067
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:43,470
and then you'd get spoiled with the
kids that were 10 years old and saying,

3068
01:16:43,471 --> 01:16:44,380
do a nation peds.

3069
01:16:44,710 --> 01:16:46,570
And then no one got hurt.

3070
01:16:46,630 --> 01:16:47,980
And then after three hours,

3071
01:16:47,981 --> 01:16:49,660
you're still smiling and still joking.

3072
01:16:50,140 --> 01:16:51,400
But you've learned so much.

3073
01:16:51,401 --> 01:16:52,020
You've learned it.

3074
01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:55,360
You just got your ass kicked by a
10 year old without getting beat up,

3075
01:16:55,390 --> 01:16:56,223
if that makes sense.

3076
01:16:56,510 --> 01:16:57,340
When we box,

3077
01:16:57,340 --> 01:16:57,861
when we box,

3078
01:16:57,861 --> 01:16:58,720
we spy about 80,

3079
01:16:58,721 --> 01:16:59,554
90%.

3080
01:16:59,620 --> 01:17:00,160
But when we,

3081
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:00,490
when we,

3082
01:17:00,490 --> 01:17:02,620
when we kick and play
in and in the clinch,

3083
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:03,070
uh,

3084
01:17:03,070 --> 01:17:04,960
it's a bit more control
over the Clinton is harder.

3085
01:17:04,961 --> 01:17:05,771
That is I suppose.

3086
01:17:05,771 --> 01:17:05,951
But,

3087
01:17:05,951 --> 01:17:06,580
um,

3088
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:08,680
longevity as you can do that in a clinch,

3089
01:17:08,681 --> 01:17:09,630
the same like Jujitsu,

3090
01:17:09,650 --> 01:17:12,600
you can go full blast and you don't
have to worry about it cause you're not

3091
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:13,520
striking each other.

3092
01:17:13,540 --> 01:17:13,790
Yeah.

3093
01:17:13,790 --> 01:17:14,121
I've had,

3094
01:17:14,121 --> 01:17:14,760
um,

3095
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:16,080
122 flights now.

3096
01:17:16,430 --> 01:17:17,390
That's fucking crazy.

3097
01:17:17,510 --> 01:17:18,320
I'm sweet.

3098
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:18,800
And then I've,

3099
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:19,521
boy listen to you,

3100
01:17:19,521 --> 01:17:19,671
Lee,

3101
01:17:19,671 --> 01:17:20,241
you're talking,

3102
01:17:20,241 --> 01:17:20,841
you're fine.

3103
01:17:20,841 --> 01:17:21,740
You know there's no,

3104
01:17:21,741 --> 01:17:22,880
there's no dementia,

3105
01:17:22,881 --> 01:17:24,080
there's no slurring words.

3106
01:17:24,350 --> 01:17:26,210
Have 122 boxing fights.

3107
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:27,020
Yeah,

3108
01:17:27,020 --> 01:17:28,010
Jesus Christ.

3109
01:17:28,070 --> 01:17:28,903
Um,

3110
01:17:29,150 --> 01:17:29,690
so,

3111
01:17:29,690 --> 01:17:30,090
uh,

3112
01:17:30,090 --> 01:17:34,090
and then you hear about MMA guys and
then if they have more than 30 flights,

3113
01:17:34,091 --> 01:17:34,550
it's a big,

3114
01:17:34,550 --> 01:17:35,383
it's a big deal.

3115
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:36,661
But yeah.

3116
01:17:36,661 --> 01:17:37,190
Let's see.

3117
01:17:37,190 --> 01:17:39,110
And then Jeremy Horn had
over a hundred fights,

3118
01:17:39,111 --> 01:17:40,470
but very intelligent fought,

3119
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:41,313
real smart,

3120
01:17:41,330 --> 01:17:42,230
very bright guy,

3121
01:17:42,231 --> 01:17:43,160
very technical,

3122
01:17:43,161 --> 01:17:43,760
didn't,

3123
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:45,470
it's not like an athletic,

3124
01:17:45,590 --> 01:17:46,161
powerful,

3125
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:46,701
super,

3126
01:17:46,701 --> 01:17:47,240
you know,

3127
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:48,140
freak athlete.

3128
01:17:48,410 --> 01:17:51,500
Everything he had to do was
proper technique and intelligence.

3129
01:17:51,501 --> 01:17:53,420
And to this day over a hundred fights,

3130
01:17:53,540 --> 01:17:54,261
Jeremy Horn,

3131
01:17:54,261 --> 01:17:56,570
like you would never know it
talking to him or looking at them,

3132
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:56,781
you know,

3133
01:17:56,781 --> 01:17:57,411
he looks great.

3134
01:17:57,411 --> 01:17:58,244
Talks Great.

3135
01:17:58,280 --> 01:17:59,820
The majority of the ties I've had uh,

3136
01:18:00,530 --> 01:18:02,510
two two 50 flights and then,

3137
01:18:02,620 --> 01:18:02,990
um,

3138
01:18:02,990 --> 01:18:04,280
yeah it's just normal.

3139
01:18:04,310 --> 01:18:07,100
It's 255 times fucking crazy.

3140
01:18:07,130 --> 01:18:11,000
We had a 10 year old kid in the eye camp
that had a hundred fights as a 10 year

3141
01:18:11,001 --> 01:18:11,211
old.

3142
01:18:11,211 --> 01:18:11,421
He'd,

3143
01:18:11,421 --> 01:18:12,530
he'd flight Monday,

3144
01:18:12,531 --> 01:18:14,090
Tuesday rest Wednesday,

3145
01:18:14,091 --> 01:18:14,781
fight Thursday,

3146
01:18:14,781 --> 01:18:19,280
said they possibly rest Sunday and then
every time you fight he is making 500

3147
01:18:19,281 --> 01:18:19,520
bucks,

3148
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:20,353
500 bucks.

3149
01:18:20,540 --> 01:18:23,030
So then he's parents
didn't have to work almost.

3150
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:27,350
He was making enough money as a
junior fighting four times a week,

3151
01:18:27,351 --> 01:18:30,830
five times a week where he could
support the family just as,

3152
01:18:30,831 --> 01:18:31,640
as a,

3153
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:34,100
as a 10 year old say,

3154
01:18:34,170 --> 01:18:34,601
say,

3155
01:18:34,601 --> 01:18:34,790
yeah,

3156
01:18:34,790 --> 01:18:35,000
it's,

3157
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:35,270
it's,

3158
01:18:35,270 --> 01:18:36,710
so for them over there,

3159
01:18:36,711 --> 01:18:38,710
it's a 10 year old.

3160
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:39,120
I said,

3161
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:42,560
if you're at 25 kilos to you're not
working with a hundred percent Perry that

3162
01:18:42,561 --> 01:18:44,060
you your score and
you're playing the game.

3163
01:18:44,090 --> 01:18:44,923
Yeah.

3164
01:18:45,050 --> 01:18:46,170
It's not until you get into your,

3165
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:46,791
your 13,

3166
01:18:46,791 --> 01:18:49,670
14 and then you start using a bit more
forced and you're excited to get me on

3167
01:18:49,671 --> 01:18:51,350
with damage on the shins in a bit more.

3168
01:18:51,670 --> 01:18:52,130
Um,

3169
01:18:52,130 --> 01:18:53,840
you gotta be a bit more
wary of punching payer.

3170
01:18:54,050 --> 01:18:54,531
But as a,

3171
01:18:54,531 --> 01:18:56,600
as a junior from say seven to 10,

3172
01:18:56,870 --> 01:18:58,370
you can definitely get
away with fighting three,

3173
01:18:58,371 --> 01:18:58,670
four,

3174
01:18:58,670 --> 01:18:59,351
five times a week.

3175
01:18:59,351 --> 01:19:00,050
No problem.

3176
01:19:00,050 --> 01:19:00,201
Well,

3177
01:19:00,201 --> 01:19:04,160
some people say that that's the best
way to teach kids to because they learn

3178
01:19:04,161 --> 01:19:05,300
before they can hurt each other.

3179
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:05,920
Yes.

3180
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:10,920
And you learn like how to move properly
and your body develops like that.

3181
01:19:10,990 --> 01:19:11,540
You know,

3182
01:19:11,540 --> 01:19:12,530
your body develops.

3183
01:19:12,531 --> 01:19:14,930
Like there's people that are um,

3184
01:19:14,990 --> 01:19:17,630
that started out like to have like a
martial arts background when they were

3185
01:19:17,631 --> 01:19:19,460
young and then they
started putting on weight,

3186
01:19:19,461 --> 01:19:20,294
like muscle weight.

3187
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:20,961
But there's still,

3188
01:19:20,961 --> 01:19:25,961
it's super flexible and it's because their
body sort of developed throwing kicks

3189
01:19:26,841 --> 01:19:29,030
and their body develop
doing those motions.

3190
01:19:29,031 --> 01:19:30,110
And if you can learn,

3191
01:19:30,420 --> 01:19:33,140
like there's a lot of people
that believe that as as a boxer,

3192
01:19:33,590 --> 01:19:35,690
that if you don't start when you're young,

3193
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:40,370
you'll never achieve like a Floyd
Mayweather level or Roy Jones Jr level.

3194
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:41,390
Like it's not possible.

3195
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:45,920
They say it's not like your body has
to develop doing that in Australia.

3196
01:19:45,921 --> 01:19:49,370
There's a big controversy right now
because the athletic commission and the

3197
01:19:49,371 --> 01:19:50,204
government's and there,

3198
01:19:50,230 --> 01:19:51,260
they're all talking,

3199
01:19:51,261 --> 01:19:55,370
they're talking and they don't want
juniors to compete in any form of combat

3200
01:19:55,371 --> 01:19:58,130
sport whatsoever until
the age of 18 which I,

3201
01:19:58,250 --> 01:20:00,530
which I think is ludicrous
because if that happens,

3202
01:20:01,010 --> 01:20:02,780
you've got the rangers,

3203
01:20:02,810 --> 01:20:06,560
the rest of the world that have already
excelled to a certain level and if we

3204
01:20:06,561 --> 01:20:08,190
don't start competing to 18

3205
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:09,780
we're already behind the eight ball.

3206
01:20:09,781 --> 01:20:10,080
We've,

3207
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:11,400
we're so far behind that,

3208
01:20:11,420 --> 01:20:12,330
but that's so ignorant.

3209
01:20:12,331 --> 01:20:13,410
That's ignorant on their part.

3210
01:20:13,590 --> 01:20:16,320
People don't understand combat sports
because that's the time to learn.

3211
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:16,890
Yes,

3212
01:20:16,890 --> 01:20:17,191
yes,

3213
01:20:17,191 --> 01:20:17,480
and then,

3214
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:18,560
and then it's also,

3215
01:20:18,610 --> 01:20:19,710
you're not learning it.

3216
01:20:19,711 --> 01:20:20,670
It's not about the flight.

3217
01:20:20,671 --> 01:20:21,750
It's about the culture.

3218
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:22,090
Yeah.

3219
01:20:22,090 --> 01:20:23,160
It's about the lifestyle.

3220
01:20:23,161 --> 01:20:26,280
It's about living healthy and training
and training the body and getting

3221
01:20:26,281 --> 01:20:30,690
flexible and getting over the fear
of getting in competition as well.

3222
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:35,700
It's about experiencing what young
people are terrified of getting your ass

3223
01:20:35,701 --> 01:20:38,100
kicked and I'm experiencing it in the gym.

3224
01:20:38,101 --> 01:20:38,430
Right.

3225
01:20:38,430 --> 01:20:39,810
My daughter was lucky enough this,

3226
01:20:39,811 --> 01:20:41,160
that fighting at the age of eight.

3227
01:20:41,270 --> 01:20:44,400
And it's hilarious how many people say
that my daughter was lucky enough to

3228
01:20:44,401 --> 01:20:45,660
start fighting at the age of eight.

3229
01:20:45,661 --> 01:20:46,030
And then,

3230
01:20:46,030 --> 01:20:46,770
uh,

3231
01:20:46,770 --> 01:20:47,710
from the,

3232
01:20:47,820 --> 01:20:49,080
I remember she walked in as,

3233
01:20:49,081 --> 01:20:49,440
as a,

3234
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:51,510
as a little baby girl and I was,

3235
01:20:51,570 --> 01:20:52,950
I was so petrified as a father,

3236
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:54,900
but then she walked out like a woman.

3237
01:20:54,930 --> 01:20:56,160
She walked out as a warrior,

3238
01:20:56,190 --> 01:20:57,300
as eight year old warrior.

3239
01:20:57,690 --> 01:21:01,050
And then ever since she's had
this passion for the fighting.

3240
01:21:01,290 --> 01:21:02,730
She loves collecting trophies.

3241
01:21:02,731 --> 01:21:03,880
She loves making,

3242
01:21:04,030 --> 01:21:04,863
um,

3243
01:21:05,010 --> 01:21:07,320
magazines and doing interviews.

3244
01:21:07,321 --> 01:21:08,310
And uh,

3245
01:21:08,311 --> 01:21:08,751
it,

3246
01:21:08,751 --> 01:21:09,000
it,

3247
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,890
it makes you a bit,

3248
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:12,120
become a better person,

3249
01:21:12,121 --> 01:21:12,541
I believe.

3250
01:21:12,541 --> 01:21:13,120
I think it,

3251
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:16,920
it makes your evolve
evolves where it would,

3252
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:19,260
it definitely,

3253
01:21:19,261 --> 01:21:20,094
um,

3254
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,630
people had never fought.

3255
01:21:21,631 --> 01:21:23,070
We never understand what it's like to,

3256
01:21:23,071 --> 01:21:26,910
to have that bond against someone
to compete for a couple of minutes.

3257
01:21:26,911 --> 01:21:27,744
And then after that,

3258
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:29,010
no matter what happens,

3259
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:31,710
I've always with 122 people,

3260
01:21:31,711 --> 01:21:32,544
I can say,

3261
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:33,750
um,

3262
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:34,621
I'm not just a friend,

3263
01:21:34,621 --> 01:21:35,090
but I have,

3264
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:37,170
I've shared a moment in
time where me and you,

3265
01:21:37,171 --> 01:21:37,410
we've,

3266
01:21:37,410 --> 01:21:40,340
we've went into a different
dimension for that,

3267
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:41,610
that time that we fought each other.

3268
01:21:41,611 --> 01:21:42,121
Does that make sense?

3269
01:21:42,121 --> 01:21:42,331
Does that,

3270
01:21:42,331 --> 01:21:42,960
it does mean that,

3271
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:43,793
you know what I mean?

3272
01:21:44,220 --> 01:21:46,440
There's nothing they can erase
that memory of me and you,

3273
01:21:46,580 --> 01:21:46,890
um,

3274
01:21:46,890 --> 01:21:49,620
the standing toe to toe
and exchanging blows.

3275
01:21:50,190 --> 01:21:51,120
So yeah,

3276
01:21:51,121 --> 01:21:51,561
I think that,

3277
01:21:51,561 --> 01:21:52,394
yeah,

3278
01:21:52,530 --> 01:21:56,130
this is why I love the sport so much
because I have such a deep passion for it.

3279
01:21:56,750 --> 01:21:56,931
Well,

3280
01:21:56,931 --> 01:21:58,760
when I was watching that
cosmo Alexander fight,

3281
01:21:58,761 --> 01:22:00,020
I was actually thinking that I was like,

3282
01:22:00,021 --> 01:22:00,441
these guys,

3283
01:22:00,441 --> 01:22:03,020
are they sharing a crazy cause
I was also thinking like,

3284
01:22:03,021 --> 01:22:06,560
you're 39 years old and I don't know
how much longer you can compete at this

3285
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:08,240
elite world class level.

3286
01:22:08,270 --> 01:22:08,481
You know,

3287
01:22:08,481 --> 01:22:10,280
you're fighting in a
world championship fight.

3288
01:22:10,820 --> 01:22:11,460
And I'm watching this,

3289
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:11,661
I'm like,

3290
01:22:11,661 --> 01:22:11,841
man,

3291
01:22:11,841 --> 01:22:12,220
this is a,

3292
01:22:12,220 --> 01:22:14,870
this is an intense moment that
these two guys are sharing.

3293
01:22:15,070 --> 01:22:18,020
And afterwards you guys were smiling
and hugging each other and I was like,

3294
01:22:18,260 --> 01:22:18,531
wow,

3295
01:22:18,531 --> 01:22:20,810
those guys really did just share a very,

3296
01:22:20,811 --> 01:22:25,100
very intense experience and a very intense
moment that very few people will ever

3297
01:22:25,101 --> 01:22:25,740
understand.

3298
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:26,101
Yeah.

3299
01:22:26,101 --> 01:22:26,401
It's,

3300
01:22:26,401 --> 01:22:26,880
um,

3301
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:27,031
yeah,

3302
01:22:27,031 --> 01:22:27,810
it's actually there.

3303
01:22:27,810 --> 01:22:28,560
And then to,

3304
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:32,520
to erase that from childhood memories
for young kids not to have that

3305
01:22:32,521 --> 01:22:33,151
experience.

3306
01:22:33,151 --> 01:22:35,670
I think that's so sad because,

3307
01:22:36,150 --> 01:22:36,720
um,

3308
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:37,480
what's better,

3309
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:39,150
especially coming from myself,

3310
01:22:39,180 --> 01:22:42,000
if to go to school on the fighting on,

3311
01:22:42,001 --> 01:22:44,700
said they in the tournament and go to
school on Monday and tell him the boys,

3312
01:22:45,020 --> 01:22:45,360
um,

3313
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:45,561
I,

3314
01:22:45,561 --> 01:22:45,721
yeah,

3315
01:22:45,721 --> 01:22:48,250
I've got a gold medal for whatever
competition that you split.

3316
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:49,113
Obg Judo,

3317
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:49,953
Jujitsu,

3318
01:22:50,010 --> 01:22:50,671
taekwondo,

3319
01:22:50,671 --> 01:22:51,151
karate.

3320
01:22:51,151 --> 01:22:51,984
It doesn't matter if it's more,

3321
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:53,040
it could be anything.

3322
01:22:53,430 --> 01:22:54,050
It's an oil,

3323
01:22:54,050 --> 01:22:54,571
even soccer,

3324
01:22:54,571 --> 01:22:55,081
football.

3325
01:22:55,081 --> 01:22:55,201
It,

3326
01:22:55,201 --> 01:22:55,510
you've,

3327
01:22:55,510 --> 01:22:55,830
you've,

3328
01:22:55,830 --> 01:23:00,240
you've gone out in the weekend and you've
excelled at that sport that you've,

3329
01:23:00,241 --> 01:23:00,960
uh,

3330
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:01,793
um,

3331
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:02,730
put your life into.

3332
01:23:02,731 --> 01:23:03,540
So,

3333
01:23:03,540 --> 01:23:05,470
and that the boys come over to house,

3334
01:23:05,471 --> 01:23:06,230
they have a sleepover.

3335
01:23:06,230 --> 01:23:08,500
You got four or five
trays up on the shelf,

3336
01:23:08,890 --> 01:23:10,510
nothing can make you more proud than,

3337
01:23:10,511 --> 01:23:13,870
than to be in there from my fighting days.

3338
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:19,200
So I think it also teaches you how to
overcome very scary moments and very

3339
01:23:19,211 --> 01:23:20,410
difficult moments.

3340
01:23:20,740 --> 01:23:24,130
And I think when you don't
overcome difficult moments,

3341
01:23:24,370 --> 01:23:25,660
you always have that fear.

3342
01:23:25,661 --> 01:23:26,071
Like how,

3343
01:23:26,071 --> 01:23:28,000
how would I do under pressure?

3344
01:23:28,270 --> 01:23:29,980
What would happen to me under PR?

3345
01:23:29,981 --> 01:23:31,900
I mean how would I do
when the chips are down,

3346
01:23:31,901 --> 01:23:32,800
when I'm nervous.

3347
01:23:32,830 --> 01:23:33,400
I mean,

3348
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:34,810
and people who compete,

3349
01:23:34,990 --> 01:23:37,210
they have the experience of doing that.

3350
01:23:37,540 --> 01:23:41,530
And I think that's where characters
built characters built through adversity.

3351
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:44,170
And I think to deny young
kids the opportunity that,

3352
01:23:44,171 --> 01:23:46,510
especially out of ignorance
because if they don't,

3353
01:23:46,630 --> 01:23:49,930
they don't understand that young kids
don't get hurt the way adults do.

3354
01:23:49,931 --> 01:23:51,700
And you're fighting like you know,

3355
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:54,820
you see a guy like a gold con
Saki fight and Tyrone Spong,

3356
01:23:54,821 --> 01:23:56,050
those are big boys,

3357
01:23:56,500 --> 01:24:00,430
big heavy throwing guys that
are throwing fucking bombs.

3358
01:24:00,530 --> 01:24:03,430
There's a big difference between that
and two six year olds that are fighting

3359
01:24:03,431 --> 01:24:06,780
Moitai with headgear
on and the gloves and,

3360
01:24:06,781 --> 01:24:07,070
and,

3361
01:24:07,070 --> 01:24:08,980
and Shin pads in an amateur fight.

3362
01:24:09,260 --> 01:24:12,370
What those kids are doing is they're
learning how to do something that's very

3363
01:24:12,371 --> 01:24:12,930
difficult.

3364
01:24:12,930 --> 01:24:13,360
Yes.

3365
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:14,940
And that is the same coming that,

3366
01:24:14,950 --> 01:24:15,070
uh,

3367
01:24:15,070 --> 01:24:15,880
that moment,

3368
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:16,360
that same,

3369
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:17,081
the same fee,

3370
01:24:17,081 --> 01:24:18,010
but with the protection.

3371
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:19,330
So it's almost the same.

3372
01:24:19,420 --> 01:24:20,700
I like what you said on the,

3373
01:24:20,710 --> 01:24:21,880
I have eye shade one,

3374
01:24:21,881 --> 01:24:24,550
a yield quotations on my
Instagram the other day.

3375
01:24:24,590 --> 01:24:26,140
They absolutely killed it about,

3376
01:24:26,170 --> 01:24:26,560
um,

3377
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:28,210
people that have never
been in a street fight.

3378
01:24:28,670 --> 01:24:29,140
Um,

3379
01:24:29,140 --> 01:24:29,861
it's that same thing.

3380
01:24:29,861 --> 01:24:30,850
Where have people that are,

3381
01:24:31,270 --> 01:24:31,960
you'll always say,

3382
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:32,793
ah,

3383
01:24:33,190 --> 01:24:33,881
that glide pieces,

3384
01:24:33,881 --> 01:24:34,930
these pieces of me off of,

3385
01:24:34,931 --> 01:24:35,800
I'm just going to knock him out.

3386
01:24:35,801 --> 01:24:36,101
And it's like,

3387
01:24:36,101 --> 01:24:36,191
no,

3388
01:24:36,191 --> 01:24:37,024
you're not.

3389
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:39,760
You have no idea if that guy hit you back.

3390
01:24:39,761 --> 01:24:40,910
You know how much it's going to hurt.

3391
01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:43,421
Well,

3392
01:24:43,421 --> 01:24:46,810
what I said was that I don't understand
how people who have never had any

3393
01:24:46,811 --> 01:24:49,480
martial arts experience at
all are willing to fight.

3394
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:49,951
Yes.

3395
01:24:49,951 --> 01:24:50,741
Like they're crazy.

3396
01:24:50,741 --> 01:24:51,471
Like they're fighting.

3397
01:24:51,471 --> 01:24:54,070
And I've seen people fight in the
streets that you could tell when they're

3398
01:24:54,071 --> 01:24:54,461
fighting,

3399
01:24:54,461 --> 01:24:56,860
that they have no fighting
experience at all.

3400
01:24:56,861 --> 01:24:57,820
They don't know anything,

3401
01:24:58,030 --> 01:25:00,610
and yet they're willing to
take a chance and fight.

3402
01:25:00,611 --> 01:25:04,000
Some guy they don't even know and
they're going to somehow or another,

3403
01:25:04,001 --> 01:25:06,820
they think they're going to kick this
guy's ass like you don't even know.

3404
01:25:06,850 --> 01:25:07,900
You don't know anything.

3405
01:25:08,140 --> 01:25:08,973
It is

3406
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:11,470
just flailing.

3407
01:25:11,471 --> 01:25:12,400
I've seen it happen.

3408
01:25:12,401 --> 01:25:12,521
It's,

3409
01:25:12,521 --> 01:25:13,390
it's terrifying.

3410
01:25:13,391 --> 01:25:14,260
I don't understand it.

3411
01:25:14,261 --> 01:25:17,440
I don't know how people are willing to
do that so mad right now I'm just going

3412
01:25:17,441 --> 01:25:18,520
to go walk over the Amgen.

3413
01:25:18,521 --> 01:25:19,354
Lucky man.

3414
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:20,141
It's not that.

3415
01:25:20,141 --> 01:25:20,741
It's not that.

3416
01:25:20,741 --> 01:25:21,880
It's not that easy.

3417
01:25:21,910 --> 01:25:22,540
And then,

3418
01:25:22,540 --> 01:25:24,100
and then once that
confrontations thoughts,

3419
01:25:24,101 --> 01:25:25,810
if you hit that person and
then you don't knock him out,

3420
01:25:25,811 --> 01:25:28,070
you're just going to piss him
off or you break your hand.

3421
01:25:28,930 --> 01:25:31,800
How many times did people don't not throw
a punch and hit a guy in the forehead

3422
01:25:31,801 --> 01:25:33,310
and just smash your hand open?

3423
01:25:33,430 --> 01:25:33,600
Oh,

3424
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:33,781
they,

3425
01:25:33,781 --> 01:25:35,780
they pull it out and
then they break a bottle.

3426
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:37,690
They pull something out
of the pockets of Christ.

3427
01:25:37,970 --> 01:25:39,640
Then it gets this Nixon level,

3428
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:40,990
it's life or death now.

3429
01:25:41,330 --> 01:25:41,730
Great.

3430
01:25:41,730 --> 01:25:43,150
You don't know how to fight at all.

3431
01:25:43,151 --> 01:25:46,140
And you're in a life or death situation
where you just hope this guy doesn't

3432
01:25:46,150 --> 01:25:46,940
kill you.

3433
01:25:46,940 --> 01:25:47,141
You know?

3434
01:25:47,141 --> 01:25:49,450
Let's hope somebody that
rescues you beforehand.

3435
01:25:49,750 --> 01:25:50,583
It's terrifying,

3436
01:25:50,810 --> 01:25:51,040
you know?

3437
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:52,570
Especially because the different,

3438
01:25:52,571 --> 01:25:52,900
there's a,

3439
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:53,740
there's a big difference.

3440
01:25:53,741 --> 01:25:57,400
And I think that's where a lot of people
get confused when it comes to martial

3441
01:25:57,401 --> 01:25:59,050
arts and the equated with violence,

3442
01:25:59,490 --> 01:25:59,830
the,

3443
01:25:59,830 --> 01:26:00,390
the,

3444
01:26:00,390 --> 01:26:00,820
the,

3445
01:26:00,820 --> 01:26:01,320
the,

3446
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:04,660
the competition of a fight or have a,

3447
01:26:04,730 --> 01:26:05,800
an event like a,

3448
01:26:05,801 --> 01:26:08,390
a martial arts event is very,

3449
01:26:08,391 --> 01:26:13,370
very different thing because
you're preparing for a
skill contest and the skill

3450
01:26:13,371 --> 01:26:15,290
contest may be dangerous and there's a Po,

3451
01:26:15,350 --> 01:26:18,110
there's possibly violent
endings to these things,

3452
01:26:18,290 --> 01:26:23,150
but it's not violence in the sense of
you're not like trying to go out and find

3453
01:26:23,151 --> 01:26:24,560
someone and make them your victim.

3454
01:26:24,620 --> 01:26:26,420
What you're doing is
you're trying to compete,

3455
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:27,201
you're competing.

3456
01:26:27,201 --> 01:26:28,160
And in doing so,

3457
01:26:28,610 --> 01:26:33,260
you learn something about yourself and
you develop a confidence that for someone

3458
01:26:33,261 --> 01:26:34,640
who's never competed like that,

3459
01:26:34,860 --> 01:26:36,350
it never totally understand.

3460
01:26:36,530 --> 01:26:36,890
Yes.

3461
01:26:36,890 --> 01:26:38,030
If violent game of chess.

3462
01:26:38,110 --> 01:26:38,943
Yeah.

3463
01:26:39,010 --> 01:26:40,430
And even more crazy than chess,

3464
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:43,280
especially MMA because
there's so many more,

3465
01:26:43,310 --> 01:26:44,510
there's so many moves.

3466
01:26:44,511 --> 01:26:46,830
There's so much going on this like if you,

3467
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:48,680
if you're playing chess,

3468
01:26:48,681 --> 01:26:52,070
you have so much time to think about it
unless you're playing that speed chess

3469
01:26:52,071 --> 01:26:53,210
shit where they're hitting the clock.

3470
01:26:53,570 --> 01:26:57,440
But when you're playing chess and
you're overlooking this board,

3471
01:26:57,710 --> 01:27:01,280
I mean not taking anything away from
chess because chess is a fascinating game

3472
01:27:01,610 --> 01:27:04,250
and there's so much complexity to it
and there's so many different moves,

3473
01:27:04,251 --> 01:27:06,560
so many different possible combinations.

3474
01:27:06,561 --> 01:27:08,390
But believe it or not,

3475
01:27:08,570 --> 01:27:11,420
there are more possible
combinations and fighting.

3476
01:27:11,630 --> 01:27:13,400
There's more possible combinations.

3477
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:15,260
The outcome is more terrifying.

3478
01:27:15,470 --> 01:27:16,640
More is at stake.

3479
01:27:16,641 --> 01:27:18,440
Your physical health is at stake.

3480
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:22,460
You're gambling your health on discipline.

3481
01:27:22,610 --> 01:27:24,080
You have to get up in the morning,

3482
01:27:24,081 --> 01:27:24,380
you're,

3483
01:27:24,380 --> 01:27:29,380
you have to overcome your body being
tired and sore and you got to get up when

3484
01:27:29,601 --> 01:27:30,381
you don't want to.

3485
01:27:30,381 --> 01:27:32,090
When that warm bed is calling you,

3486
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:34,880
you got to put on your fucking running
shoes and you've got to go do your

3487
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:37,570
roadwork and you've got
to do your strength and
conditioning and you've got to

3488
01:27:37,571 --> 01:27:37,971
spar.

3489
01:27:37,971 --> 01:27:41,160
When you don't want a spa and your body's
starting to get run down and you've

3490
01:27:41,161 --> 01:27:42,770
got to make sure you get
the right amount of sleep.

3491
01:27:42,771 --> 01:27:44,750
You got to make sure you're getting
the right amount of nutrition.

3492
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:46,160
There's all these variables,

3493
01:27:46,220 --> 01:27:47,090
emotions,

3494
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:47,661
the,

3495
01:27:47,661 --> 01:27:48,980
the physical fear,

3496
01:27:48,981 --> 01:27:50,840
the fear of your own demise,

3497
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:52,080
not the nerves of a,

3498
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:54,830
I'm sure chess players get
nervous before they have a match,

3499
01:27:54,980 --> 01:27:57,740
but do you think they get nervous
the way a fighter gets nervous?

3500
01:27:58,010 --> 01:27:59,090
I don't think it's possible.

3501
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:00,750
And they'll have to go in
the hospital after then.

3502
01:28:00,780 --> 01:28:01,260
Yeah.

3503
01:28:01,260 --> 01:28:04,530
And then there's no fear or am I going
to get looked at and I'm going to cut,

3504
01:28:04,820 --> 01:28:05,480
uh,

3505
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:05,760
uh,

3506
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:06,593
when I compete,

3507
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:06,990
uh,

3508
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:08,910
I tried to tell people that are
coming up through the sport.

3509
01:28:08,930 --> 01:28:09,181
Ah,

3510
01:28:09,181 --> 01:28:10,410
what's it like to have your first fight?

3511
01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:11,460
It's,

3512
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:12,840
it's luck was him before he,

3513
01:28:12,870 --> 01:28:14,220
once that the bill rings,

3514
01:28:14,250 --> 01:28:15,300
everything goes numb.

3515
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:17,040
And you don't have time to think,

3516
01:28:17,041 --> 01:28:18,270
so you have to take yourself.

3517
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:19,740
Everything's on that muscle memory.

3518
01:28:19,741 --> 01:28:24,590
So say many times I've been punched or
keep that or an elbow is shown and I've

3519
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:27,870
blocked it with a quarter of a second ago,

3520
01:28:27,871 --> 01:28:29,720
and I'm thinking in my Haiti,

3521
01:28:29,721 --> 01:28:31,680
if that had a hit me flush out
would have been knocked out.

3522
01:28:32,130 --> 01:28:32,911
But I'm somehow,

3523
01:28:32,911 --> 01:28:37,470
rather than when my body
knows the blocking time to
camera and time and then I

3524
01:28:37,471 --> 01:28:38,281
don't hear anything,

3525
01:28:38,281 --> 01:28:39,990
I don't see anything besides my opponent.

3526
01:28:40,020 --> 01:28:40,350
Uh,

3527
01:28:40,350 --> 01:28:41,030
I can't,

3528
01:28:41,030 --> 01:28:41,170
uh,

3529
01:28:41,170 --> 01:28:41,790
yeah,

3530
01:28:41,790 --> 01:28:43,320
just in this different world.

3531
01:28:43,710 --> 01:28:44,543
And then the end,

3532
01:28:44,550 --> 01:28:45,760
the end of the book,

3533
01:28:46,050 --> 01:28:46,830
the fight,

3534
01:28:46,830 --> 01:28:50,010
the bell rings Ding and all of a sudden
it seems that the world opens back up

3535
01:28:50,011 --> 01:28:50,250
again.

3536
01:28:50,250 --> 01:28:51,150
I'm back on the chair,

3537
01:28:51,420 --> 01:28:52,770
I can hear voices again.

3538
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:53,910
Uh,

3539
01:28:53,910 --> 01:28:55,330
and then I can't remember the fight.

3540
01:28:55,530 --> 01:28:56,700
The fight is just a blur.

3541
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:57,570
Um,

3542
01:28:57,570 --> 01:28:58,580
it's like Toby was a Haiti,

3543
01:28:58,590 --> 01:29:00,840
remember this or that or til
you watch the replay on the,

3544
01:29:00,841 --> 01:29:01,500
on,

3545
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:02,070
on the phone

3546
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:03,780
or the internet or the replay.

3547
01:29:03,781 --> 01:29:04,614
But um,

3548
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:05,400
it's it,

3549
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:05,731
yeah,

3550
01:29:05,731 --> 01:29:06,240
he just,

3551
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:08,520
you into a different realm completely.

3552
01:29:08,521 --> 01:29:10,670
It's such a unique experience to,

3553
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:11,400
to,

3554
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:16,010
to turn off your brain and just
rely on pure instinct as a,

3555
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:16,540
it's a,

3556
01:29:16,540 --> 01:29:17,520
it's again,

3557
01:29:17,580 --> 01:29:18,210
that's why I love it.

3558
01:29:18,210 --> 01:29:19,043
I love it so much.

3559
01:29:19,230 --> 01:29:23,040
It's going to be an intensity that
no one else could ever understand.

3560
01:29:23,041 --> 01:29:26,670
And that's probably a bond that you
share with those people that you get into

3561
01:29:26,671 --> 01:29:27,121
the ring with,

3562
01:29:27,121 --> 01:29:28,220
like Cosmo Xander,

3563
01:29:28,221 --> 01:29:33,221
that the average person would just never
be able to understand what you guys

3564
01:29:33,391 --> 01:29:34,260
have gone through.

3565
01:29:34,410 --> 01:29:34,711
Yeah.

3566
01:29:34,711 --> 01:29:39,630
And then the idea you've been cut and you
can the one eyes blurry from the blood

3567
01:29:39,690 --> 01:29:40,050
and you,

3568
01:29:40,050 --> 01:29:42,780
and you don't want to wipe it because
that's a tale from your opponent,

3569
01:29:42,900 --> 01:29:44,040
the bloods that no noise.

3570
01:29:44,041 --> 01:29:47,910
So you've got to try and stay there with
one way or red and bloody and Yucky.

3571
01:29:47,910 --> 01:29:49,890
And you can feel a stickiness in your eye,

3572
01:29:50,380 --> 01:29:50,920
uh,

3573
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:52,260
and you can feel the pain,

3574
01:29:52,290 --> 01:29:56,000
you can feel your eyes throbbing
and then you've got to turn off a,

3575
01:29:56,010 --> 01:29:56,843
it's such a,

3576
01:29:57,140 --> 01:30:02,040
you got to take yourself as such in that
you've got to go so much soul searching

3577
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:04,570
to keep focus on,

3578
01:30:04,620 --> 01:30:05,910
on being violent.

3579
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,530
And trying to win no matter how,

3580
01:30:07,531 --> 01:30:08,490
even though you're losing,

3581
01:30:08,491 --> 01:30:11,580
you know that you have to like try and
come back and still still knock this guy

3582
01:30:11,581 --> 01:30:15,000
out and make adjustments and make
adjustments and just turn the pain off.

3583
01:30:15,001 --> 01:30:17,660
Yet still trying to focus
on how am I going to this,

3584
01:30:17,670 --> 01:30:18,840
what I'm doing is not working.

3585
01:30:18,841 --> 01:30:22,380
So I have to try and up the ante and try
something else and that might get me in

3586
01:30:22,381 --> 01:30:26,530
more danger again where I might get
even more cat or my or more beat up or

3587
01:30:26,580 --> 01:30:27,570
another need of the face.

3588
01:30:28,020 --> 01:30:32,640
So do you ever work with a hypnotist or
a psychologist or a sports psychologist

3589
01:30:32,641 --> 01:30:33,070
or anything?

3590
01:30:33,070 --> 01:30:33,903
Uh,

3591
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:35,460
I know,

3592
01:30:35,461 --> 01:30:36,000
uh,

3593
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,050
Vinny shoreman I,

3594
01:30:38,350 --> 01:30:39,121
I'm good friends with any,

3595
01:30:39,121 --> 01:30:41,090
but I never worked with anyone I know.

3596
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:43,670
Try with Vinnie Vinnie's I was,

3597
01:30:43,671 --> 01:30:44,371
I was wondering,

3598
01:30:44,371 --> 01:30:44,701
I was like,

3599
01:30:44,701 --> 01:30:45,534
what is this?

3600
01:30:45,540 --> 01:30:45,870
Yeah,

3601
01:30:45,870 --> 01:30:47,490
hypnosis and Vinny put me under,

3602
01:30:47,530 --> 01:30:48,270
yeah,

3603
01:30:48,270 --> 01:30:49,470
I knew I was under,

3604
01:30:49,471 --> 01:30:50,071
but I was like,

3605
01:30:50,071 --> 01:30:50,341
Whoa,

3606
01:30:50,341 --> 01:30:51,870
this is a strange state.

3607
01:30:51,871 --> 01:30:52,704
He puts you in.

3608
01:30:52,900 --> 01:30:54,180
He's a very interesting cat.

3609
01:30:54,220 --> 01:30:54,671
Then he's been,

3610
01:30:54,671 --> 01:30:55,021
he's cool.

3611
01:30:55,021 --> 01:30:56,580
He came out to Australia with a friend.

3612
01:30:56,581 --> 01:30:57,810
And where any Alison and then,

3613
01:30:57,811 --> 01:30:58,290
um,

3614
01:30:58,290 --> 01:31:00,720
there were hanging out for a
week and we were good buddies.

3615
01:31:00,721 --> 01:31:00,901
But,

3616
01:31:00,901 --> 01:31:01,734
uh,

3617
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:03,300
and then in Australia as well,

3618
01:31:03,301 --> 01:31:06,540
there's a lot of mine coaches as well
that I've noticed that of setting to a

3619
01:31:06,541 --> 01:31:07,321
period of somewhere.

3620
01:31:07,321 --> 01:31:08,730
But because I'd been in Thailand so long,

3621
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:11,820
I don't believe I need mine coaching.

3622
01:31:11,820 --> 01:31:15,960
I believe I'm already at that stage in
my life where I know exactly what I want.

3623
01:31:16,410 --> 01:31:17,910
Same with this world title with Cosmos.

3624
01:31:17,940 --> 01:31:18,773
I know I wanted it.

3625
01:31:18,780 --> 01:31:20,310
I didn't need someone to
tell me that I wanted it.

3626
01:31:20,340 --> 01:31:22,410
I know I want it and when I lose it,

3627
01:31:22,411 --> 01:31:23,790
I'm just fucking pisses me off.

3628
01:31:23,791 --> 01:31:25,670
But I think,

3629
01:31:25,830 --> 01:31:26,430
um,

3630
01:31:26,430 --> 01:31:28,830
a lot of people have that
thought about what it is.

3631
01:31:28,831 --> 01:31:29,250
And I've,

3632
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:30,090
I did as well,

3633
01:31:30,091 --> 01:31:30,360
like,

3634
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:30,661
oh,

3635
01:31:30,661 --> 01:31:34,680
well what you're gonna do is it's going
to solidify what you want and you go

3636
01:31:34,681 --> 01:31:35,514
after it.

3637
01:31:35,580 --> 01:31:39,930
I don't necessarily think it's that
what Vinny instead of hypnosis,

3638
01:31:39,931 --> 01:31:44,610
what Vinny likes to think of it as like
you're optimizing the pathways for your

3639
01:31:44,611 --> 01:31:45,444
focus.

3640
01:31:45,690 --> 01:31:47,010
And instead of like saying,

3641
01:31:47,011 --> 01:31:47,671
I know what I want,

3642
01:31:47,671 --> 01:31:48,504
I'm gonna go get it.

3643
01:31:48,660 --> 01:31:51,780
It's sharpening that to a razor's edge.

3644
01:31:51,810 --> 01:31:52,710
And I think that,

3645
01:31:52,711 --> 01:31:53,544
um,

3646
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:54,360
I think you should,

3647
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:56,220
I think everyone should
look into it and not,

3648
01:31:56,221 --> 01:31:58,710
and not necessarily saying that
everyone should implement it.

3649
01:31:58,711 --> 01:31:59,260
Like,

3650
01:31:59,260 --> 01:32:00,230
like here's a perfect example

3651
01:32:00,230 --> 01:32:02,200
of like Roy Jones Jr in his prime.

3652
01:32:02,410 --> 01:32:05,080
How would say just do
everything you're doing.

3653
01:32:05,170 --> 01:32:06,400
Don't change a God damn thing.

3654
01:32:06,401 --> 01:32:07,234
You know what I'm saying?

3655
01:32:07,240 --> 01:32:12,160
I mean when he was fighting and just
moving like no one has ever moved before

3656
01:32:12,161 --> 01:32:14,590
knocking guys out with combinations
that were just ridiculous.

3657
01:32:14,591 --> 01:32:17,200
Like how could you say that guy
needs to go to a mind coach?

3658
01:32:17,470 --> 01:32:18,430
You can't write.

3659
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:23,760
But I really honestly believe that even
though I would say just do whatever

3660
01:32:24,011 --> 01:32:24,640
you're doing,

3661
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:26,920
if he did go to a mind coach,

3662
01:32:26,980 --> 01:32:29,470
it would probably take it
to an even different level.

3663
01:32:29,770 --> 01:32:31,450
Probably take it to an even higher level.

3664
01:32:31,750 --> 01:32:34,570
I think that everything you do,

3665
01:32:34,690 --> 01:32:36,940
everything you do is good.

3666
01:32:36,941 --> 01:32:37,774
As you're doing it,

3667
01:32:37,810 --> 01:32:38,650
you could do it better.

3668
01:32:38,830 --> 01:32:40,690
I think everything can be optimized,

3669
01:32:40,750 --> 01:32:40,991
you know?

3670
01:32:40,991 --> 01:32:43,960
And I think everything has
layers and levels to it.

3671
01:32:44,230 --> 01:32:45,460
And to say,

3672
01:32:45,490 --> 01:32:46,450
this is good enough,

3673
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:47,680
this we're done here.

3674
01:32:48,010 --> 01:32:53,010
I just think honestly it almost like it
disrespects the process of evolution.

3675
01:32:54,240 --> 01:32:55,870
It disrespects the process of,

3676
01:32:55,871 --> 01:32:56,704
of getting,

3677
01:32:56,770 --> 01:32:58,390
getting better at it of greatness.

3678
01:32:58,570 --> 01:33:02,740
Like for every Roy Jones Jr there's a
guy watching Roy Jones Jr and thinking

3679
01:33:02,780 --> 01:33:05,920
I've got to figure out a way to beat
that motherfucker and training harder and

3680
01:33:05,921 --> 01:33:10,921
maybe he has just as many physical gifts
and maybe he has just a slight edge in

3681
01:33:11,151 --> 01:33:12,400
some sort of a weird,

3682
01:33:12,401 --> 01:33:16,150
strange way because he's been
watching Roy Jones jr compete.

3683
01:33:16,390 --> 01:33:16,511
I mean,

3684
01:33:16,511 --> 01:33:17,344
I don't know man.

3685
01:33:17,380 --> 01:33:22,380
I think that this sport is all
about like minute differences,

3686
01:33:22,780 --> 01:33:24,130
like all combat sports.

3687
01:33:24,310 --> 01:33:25,143
Just like I do,

3688
01:33:25,160 --> 01:33:25,371
you know,

3689
01:33:25,371 --> 01:33:27,640
nick curse on his strength
and conditioning coach,

3690
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:29,261
really a highly,

3691
01:33:29,261 --> 01:33:30,520
highly respected trains.

3692
01:33:30,521 --> 01:33:31,090
Um,

3693
01:33:31,090 --> 01:33:35,200
Hofeld dos Anjos who's the UFC lightweight
champion and trains a rustle on

3694
01:33:35,201 --> 01:33:36,130
providing a cough,

3695
01:33:36,131 --> 01:33:41,131
a famous boxer and bunch of other
elite athletes done some work with Joe

3696
01:33:41,410 --> 01:33:41,820
Schilling now too,

3697
01:33:41,820 --> 01:33:43,000
was doing some work with Joe Schilling.

3698
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:43,871
And,

3699
01:33:43,871 --> 01:33:44,560
um,

3700
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:46,330
he said something really interesting when,

3701
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:47,010
um,

3702
01:33:47,010 --> 01:33:50,020
Hofeld dos Anjos beat
Anthony Pettis and he said,

3703
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:51,221
you know,

3704
01:33:51,221 --> 01:33:52,720
one of the things that we did with him,

3705
01:33:52,910 --> 01:33:53,350
um,

3706
01:33:53,350 --> 01:33:53,850
these,

3707
01:33:53,850 --> 01:33:54,101
uh,

3708
01:33:54,101 --> 01:33:54,581
all these,

3709
01:33:54,581 --> 01:33:54,701
uh,

3710
01:33:54,701 --> 01:33:55,930
strength and conditioning drills,

3711
01:33:55,931 --> 01:34:00,910
it's about executing and getting
there just slightly faster.

3712
01:34:01,090 --> 01:34:01,540
And he's like,

3713
01:34:01,540 --> 01:34:02,950
even though he dominated that fight,

3714
01:34:02,951 --> 01:34:04,180
think about those exchanges.

3715
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:07,420
He dominated those exchanges
by maybe a half a second.

3716
01:34:07,630 --> 01:34:09,460
Like he landed a half a second quicker.

3717
01:34:09,580 --> 01:34:10,870
He was a half a second.

3718
01:34:10,930 --> 01:34:13,480
What were is recovery was
just a little quicker.

3719
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:15,850
He was able to reengage
just a little quicker.

3720
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,840
And those little tiny edges,

3721
01:34:17,850 --> 01:34:22,420
there's little tiny edges means he lands
first and it means he's dominating.

3722
01:34:22,540 --> 01:34:23,980
And even though his advantage,

3723
01:34:23,981 --> 01:34:27,400
like physically his advantage
of execution was so small,

3724
01:34:27,580 --> 01:34:28,450
it was enough.

3725
01:34:28,580 --> 01:34:31,300
Those little advantages
are enough to win a fight.

3726
01:34:31,660 --> 01:34:33,850
And it's incredible when
you think about it that way,

3727
01:34:34,300 --> 01:34:36,250
that this sport is just,

3728
01:34:36,430 --> 01:34:41,020
it's a matter of like these
incremental increases in ability,

3729
01:34:41,290 --> 01:34:43,000
incremental advances.

3730
01:34:43,030 --> 01:34:43,410
Yeah.

3731
01:34:43,410 --> 01:34:44,740
So fascinating to me.

3732
01:34:44,741 --> 01:34:45,910
I never grow tired of it.

3733
01:34:46,390 --> 01:34:47,610
I guess I'm sort of a,

3734
01:34:47,690 --> 01:34:52,690
an the cavemen era to where I believe
that I think what they're the mind coaches

3735
01:34:52,931 --> 01:34:54,460
are doing awesome.

3736
01:34:54,490 --> 01:34:56,590
But at the same time I don't need
someone in the pat my back and say,

3737
01:34:56,591 --> 01:34:56,711
hey,

3738
01:34:56,711 --> 01:34:57,530
you're doing a good job.

3739
01:34:57,530 --> 01:34:57,980
Right.

3740
01:34:57,980 --> 01:34:58,460
Okay.

3741
01:34:58,460 --> 01:34:59,810
I had him doing that though.

3742
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:00,290
Yeah.

3743
01:35:00,290 --> 01:35:00,740
Yeah.

3744
01:35:00,740 --> 01:35:02,150
I don't think they're
doing a talk to Vinnie.

3745
01:35:02,151 --> 01:35:03,170
I mean maybe,

3746
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:05,810
maybe he give you a bit
of an insight on it,

3747
01:35:05,990 --> 01:35:08,180
but I think you're right too.

3748
01:35:08,930 --> 01:35:09,171
You know,

3749
01:35:09,171 --> 01:35:11,090
I'm not saying he's
right and you're wrong.

3750
01:35:11,091 --> 01:35:12,380
I think you're right too,

3751
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:15,680
because you're a proven champion,

3752
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:16,341
you know,

3753
01:35:16,341 --> 01:35:17,360
and that mindset,

3754
01:35:17,361 --> 01:35:19,550
the steely determination
that you've developed,

3755
01:35:19,551 --> 01:35:20,900
like nobody needs to
tell you how to do it.

3756
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:21,651
You know,

3757
01:35:21,651 --> 01:35:21,920
I,

3758
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:23,750
I firmly believe you're one of those guys.

3759
01:35:23,751 --> 01:35:26,540
You could wake up at three o'clock in
the morning and say it's go time and you

3760
01:35:26,541 --> 01:35:27,231
put your shorts on,

3761
01:35:27,231 --> 01:35:28,610
wrap your hands and you know,

3762
01:35:28,611 --> 01:35:29,480
what the fuck to do.

3763
01:35:29,750 --> 01:35:31,070
You just kind of fall into it.

3764
01:35:31,071 --> 01:35:31,281
You know,

3765
01:35:31,281 --> 01:35:32,030
it's your thing.

3766
01:35:32,030 --> 01:35:33,110
It'd been doing it forever.

3767
01:35:33,630 --> 01:35:36,110
I cause there's a gentleman
in Australia that's doing it.

3768
01:35:36,111 --> 01:35:37,870
And then if someone's
having a bad day on it,

3769
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:38,601
they call him and say,

3770
01:35:38,601 --> 01:35:38,931
Oh man,

3771
01:35:38,931 --> 01:35:39,770
I had a bad session.

3772
01:35:39,770 --> 01:35:40,603
What do I do?

3773
01:35:40,750 --> 01:35:41,583
Don't worry.

3774
01:35:41,630 --> 01:35:44,240
Tomorrow's a new day where I know,

3775
01:35:44,270 --> 01:35:44,571
okay,

3776
01:35:44,571 --> 01:35:45,320
today I fucked up.

3777
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:46,131
Tomorrow I'm going to,

3778
01:35:46,131 --> 01:35:48,170
I'm going to train harder and make
sure that it doesn't happen again.

3779
01:35:48,340 --> 01:35:48,490
Yeah,

3780
01:35:48,490 --> 01:35:49,490
you're on mind coach.

3781
01:35:50,980 --> 01:35:52,640
And then I let no one else
to blame but myself too.

3782
01:35:52,641 --> 01:35:56,420
So I'm very lucky in Australia
that I owned the gym.

3783
01:35:56,421 --> 01:35:58,190
I'm on my own train and my manager,

3784
01:35:58,460 --> 01:36:02,000
I do all my own Nigga
negotiations with uh,

3785
01:36:02,030 --> 01:36:02,863
promoters.

3786
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:03,780
Uh,

3787
01:36:03,780 --> 01:36:08,150
I have my friends that come in like Kevin
from New Zealand here that comes and

3788
01:36:08,151 --> 01:36:08,880
helps me.

3789
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:09,061
Uh,

3790
01:36:09,061 --> 01:36:09,431
and we,

3791
01:36:09,431 --> 01:36:10,131
we work on different,

3792
01:36:10,131 --> 01:36:10,880
we talk,

3793
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:13,550
I give him ideas of what
I want to do on the pads.

3794
01:36:13,970 --> 01:36:14,660
Uh,

3795
01:36:14,660 --> 01:36:15,320
so,

3796
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:16,200
so everything I'm,

3797
01:36:16,201 --> 01:36:16,550
I've,

3798
01:36:16,550 --> 01:36:18,000
I'm in control of my own destiny,

3799
01:36:18,020 --> 01:36:18,853
if that makes sense.

3800
01:36:19,190 --> 01:36:20,750
I've got no one dictating me what to do.

3801
01:36:20,790 --> 01:36:21,850
I'm not,

3802
01:36:21,990 --> 01:36:25,190
I was the one that reached out to
Scott can try and get in line for,

3803
01:36:25,191 --> 01:36:27,530
I'm the one that's reaching out
to all these different guys.

3804
01:36:27,530 --> 01:36:29,360
So you like that,

3805
01:36:29,960 --> 01:36:31,130
but some people don't.

3806
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:31,401
Right.

3807
01:36:31,401 --> 01:36:32,410
Some people like they're,

3808
01:36:32,450 --> 01:36:33,620
they just don't want to train.

3809
01:36:33,650 --> 01:36:34,341
They don't want to thank,

3810
01:36:34,341 --> 01:36:36,050
they want their manager
to tell him who the fight.

3811
01:36:36,430 --> 01:36:39,230
They want everything set up for them
and they just want to concentrate on

3812
01:36:39,231 --> 01:36:39,680
training.

3813
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:40,160
Yeah.

3814
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:40,850
Um,

3815
01:36:40,850 --> 01:36:41,280
yeah.

3816
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:42,920
Well cause I've finished toilet.

3817
01:36:42,930 --> 01:36:45,140
When I moved back to Australia
from Thailand there was,

3818
01:36:45,141 --> 01:36:46,310
there was no one for me there.

3819
01:36:46,311 --> 01:36:49,280
So opened a gym because I
needed somebody to train.

3820
01:36:49,281 --> 01:36:51,770
So I had to teach classes to pay their
rent so I could still have somewhere to

3821
01:36:51,771 --> 01:36:56,771
train and that sort of blossomed into
the gyms that have been successful.

3822
01:36:57,471 --> 01:37:00,110
So then I started having more guys
trained on the meeting and they wanted to

3823
01:37:00,111 --> 01:37:00,440
fight.

3824
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:03,680
Then all of a sudden I'm working their
corners and learning how to wrap hands

3825
01:37:03,681 --> 01:37:04,190
and,

3826
01:37:04,190 --> 01:37:08,420
and now I'm trying to do everything and
then also at the same time and trying to

3827
01:37:08,510 --> 01:37:09,980
create my own career as well.

3828
01:37:10,370 --> 01:37:11,360
So I've been,

3829
01:37:11,550 --> 01:37:11,840
yeah,

3830
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:12,673
so lucky then.

3831
01:37:13,690 --> 01:37:14,330
Yeah,

3832
01:37:14,330 --> 01:37:15,310
there's just,

3833
01:37:15,350 --> 01:37:16,220
it's just what happened.

3834
01:37:17,060 --> 01:37:17,893
It's not that I wanted,

3835
01:37:18,270 --> 01:37:19,220
like I wanted a coach.

3836
01:37:19,240 --> 01:37:20,240
I'd love to have a coach,

3837
01:37:20,270 --> 01:37:22,130
but at the same time it's
what I've been doing.

3838
01:37:22,131 --> 01:37:24,620
It's been working and I've been
lucky enough to be successful.

3839
01:37:24,621 --> 01:37:26,410
So where would you train if you,

3840
01:37:26,420 --> 01:37:30,070
if you didn't have to run your school
and if you didn't have to wear,

3841
01:37:30,140 --> 01:37:33,800
is there a place in the United States
or in Thailand or anywhere in the world

3842
01:37:33,801 --> 01:37:37,730
where you would train titled Thailand
was perfect for them for five years and

3843
01:37:37,731 --> 01:37:38,150
then,

3844
01:37:38,150 --> 01:37:38,983
uh,

3845
01:37:39,530 --> 01:37:41,720
definitely definitely grew out of that.

3846
01:37:41,721 --> 01:37:44,840
And when it was wanting to come to
Australia was perfect and then put,

3847
01:37:44,841 --> 01:37:46,190
where would I train you grew out of it.

3848
01:37:46,230 --> 01:37:46,940
How so?

3849
01:37:46,940 --> 01:37:47,750
Uh,

3850
01:37:47,750 --> 01:37:48,380
the,

3851
01:37:48,380 --> 01:37:50,630
the flights were so
high for so small money,

3852
01:37:51,020 --> 01:37:51,561
so,

3853
01:37:51,561 --> 01:37:52,520
so high level fides,

3854
01:37:52,521 --> 01:37:53,181
very dangerous,

3855
01:37:53,181 --> 01:37:54,320
very dangerous flights.

3856
01:37:54,590 --> 01:37:55,200
Again,

3857
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:56,011
guys with 200,

3858
01:37:56,011 --> 01:37:59,520
300 fights and then your prize
money is enough for a happy meal.

3859
01:38:02,460 --> 01:38:03,211
It was crazy.

3860
01:38:03,211 --> 01:38:04,830
And then by the time you
convert that happy meal,

3861
01:38:04,831 --> 01:38:05,910
money to Australian money,

3862
01:38:06,220 --> 01:38:06,930
um,

3863
01:38:06,930 --> 01:38:07,231
yeah,

3864
01:38:07,231 --> 01:38:08,340
you're buying a pack of chewing gum.

3865
01:38:08,920 --> 01:38:09,753
Sam,

3866
01:38:09,910 --> 01:38:12,300
what's the cheapest you ever
fought for the cheapest?

3867
01:38:12,301 --> 01:38:15,030
I fought for was 1000 bucks,

3868
01:38:15,060 --> 01:38:16,230
which was $25.

3869
01:38:16,530 --> 01:38:18,900
Oh my God.

3870
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:19,500
Yeah.

3871
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:22,590
But then you have to pay money to the
gym and then you got to think about

3872
01:38:22,591 --> 01:38:24,060
training expenses and food,

3873
01:38:24,090 --> 01:38:24,960
even losing money,

3874
01:38:25,080 --> 01:38:25,711
a lot of money.

3875
01:38:25,711 --> 01:38:26,431
So yeah,

3876
01:38:26,431 --> 01:38:27,180
it sort of sucks.

3877
01:38:27,180 --> 01:38:27,930
But then I worked,

3878
01:38:27,930 --> 01:38:30,630
I worked my way up and then my last fight
in Thailand was for 1 million bucks,

3879
01:38:30,660 --> 01:38:33,330
which was approximately 35,000 Australian.

3880
01:38:33,780 --> 01:38:34,470
And then,

3881
01:38:34,470 --> 01:38:34,860
uh,

3882
01:38:34,860 --> 01:38:35,491
that's not bad.

3883
01:38:35,491 --> 01:38:35,730
Right.

3884
01:38:35,730 --> 01:38:36,563
If that's okay.

3885
01:38:36,580 --> 01:38:40,200
It was probably like super
elite worldclass fight.

3886
01:38:40,201 --> 01:38:40,561
Yeah.

3887
01:38:40,561 --> 01:38:41,520
And then from there,

3888
01:38:41,521 --> 01:38:44,580
I've been on the under thirties
or forties for the last 10 years.

3889
01:38:44,581 --> 01:38:46,950
So I've been very fortunate
that way that I've,

3890
01:38:46,951 --> 01:38:51,360
I've enough to survive
and live comfortably and I
only have to train and look

3891
01:38:51,361 --> 01:38:52,050
half of the gym.

3892
01:38:52,050 --> 01:38:52,590
And,

3893
01:38:52,590 --> 01:38:53,290
uh,

3894
01:38:53,290 --> 01:38:55,980
we're a lot of other people that I manage.

3895
01:38:56,010 --> 01:38:56,431
And then,

3896
01:38:56,431 --> 01:38:56,900
um,

3897
01:38:56,900 --> 01:38:57,660
if they're lucky,

3898
01:38:57,660 --> 01:39:01,020
if they get $3,000 is
they've hit the jackpot.

3899
01:39:01,870 --> 01:39:04,980
It's such a hard sport to
try and become a superstar.

3900
01:39:04,981 --> 01:39:05,814
It's so hard.

3901
01:39:05,850 --> 01:39:08,610
So there was one place where
you would train if you had,

3902
01:39:08,660 --> 01:39:09,170
you know,

3903
01:39:09,170 --> 01:39:10,410
it was totally up to you,

3904
01:39:10,430 --> 01:39:11,010
I guess.

3905
01:39:11,010 --> 01:39:11,910
I guess Holland,

3906
01:39:11,970 --> 01:39:12,560
Holland.

3907
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:12,820
Well,

3908
01:39:12,820 --> 01:39:14,090
how long do you know?

3909
01:39:15,390 --> 01:39:16,170
Good question.

3910
01:39:16,170 --> 01:39:17,070
I'd probably trained,

3911
01:39:17,380 --> 01:39:21,660
we call him his core hammers is a sketch
and he's got the writing on the wall,

3912
01:39:21,690 --> 01:39:22,411
the board with,

3913
01:39:22,411 --> 01:39:23,244
um,

3914
01:39:23,580 --> 01:39:24,510
Raymond and then,

3915
01:39:24,511 --> 01:39:25,344
uh,

3916
01:39:25,350 --> 01:39:26,183
uh,

3917
01:39:26,270 --> 01:39:29,780
I was the gentleman now that trains
at a glory and there's doing this Kim,

3918
01:39:29,820 --> 01:39:32,040
Nikki Holson and I'm not sure,

3919
01:39:32,041 --> 01:39:32,591
I'm not sure he's,

3920
01:39:32,591 --> 01:39:34,820
he's with call him and
say he was for a while.

3921
01:39:34,830 --> 01:39:35,300
I wasn't off.

3922
01:39:35,300 --> 01:39:36,150
He is anymore.

3923
01:39:36,350 --> 01:39:37,900
I believe he's still with that,

3924
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:39,310
that circle of guys.

3925
01:39:41,210 --> 01:39:42,043
He's amazing.

3926
01:39:42,330 --> 01:39:42,991
He's excellent.

3927
01:39:42,991 --> 01:39:44,010
He's one of my dream flights.

3928
01:39:44,050 --> 01:39:44,320
I,

3929
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:45,570
I'm a probably a little bit older,

3930
01:39:45,571 --> 01:39:47,790
40 now because he's in his peak
and I'm a little bit older,

3931
01:39:48,030 --> 01:39:49,980
but he was one of the
guys that it's always,

3932
01:39:50,120 --> 01:39:51,840
I always thought that we'd cross paths,

3933
01:39:51,841 --> 01:39:53,730
but we never did he see,

3934
01:39:53,731 --> 01:39:54,150
um,

3935
01:39:54,150 --> 01:39:55,860
he's glory 76,

3936
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:56,420
I believe.

3937
01:39:56,420 --> 01:39:56,550
Oh,

3938
01:39:56,550 --> 01:39:58,020
[inaudible] 77.

3939
01:39:58,220 --> 01:39:58,630
Uh,

3940
01:39:58,630 --> 01:39:59,240
Georgia's weights.

3941
01:39:59,240 --> 01:39:59,490
Uh,

3942
01:39:59,490 --> 01:40:00,210
Walter.

3943
01:40:00,210 --> 01:40:00,481
Okay,

3944
01:40:00,481 --> 01:40:01,380
so it's one 70.

3945
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:01,951
I believe so.

3946
01:40:01,951 --> 01:40:02,400
Yeah.

3947
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:02,730
Yeah.

3948
01:40:02,730 --> 01:40:03,120
So He's,

3949
01:40:03,120 --> 01:40:03,391
yeah,

3950
01:40:03,391 --> 01:40:04,440
he's a little heavier,

3951
01:40:04,590 --> 01:40:07,940
a little more like cosmo
Alexander Cosmos in a kill it too.

3952
01:40:07,941 --> 01:40:09,000
He just got dynamite.

3953
01:40:09,060 --> 01:40:09,360
Uh,

3954
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:11,040
it has to left talk nasty,

3955
01:40:11,041 --> 01:40:12,180
nasty punches just like,

3956
01:40:12,210 --> 01:40:13,043
just like Raymond.

3957
01:40:13,300 --> 01:40:14,940
I'm very similar to what we'll use.

3958
01:40:14,941 --> 01:40:19,941
Is Raymond Deca mini me so well he has
a very tactical style over intelligent,

3959
01:40:20,881 --> 01:40:21,091
you know,

3960
01:40:21,091 --> 01:40:22,770
like when he fought Raymond Daniels,

3961
01:40:22,771 --> 01:40:25,650
good high knees will need
of the faces and killer,

3962
01:40:25,850 --> 01:40:27,030
but he fought Raymond Daniels,

3963
01:40:27,060 --> 01:40:30,330
Daniels throws all those wild
combinations and crazy shit.

3964
01:40:30,330 --> 01:40:30,550
You know,

3965
01:40:30,550 --> 01:40:31,560
just walked them down,

3966
01:40:31,980 --> 01:40:32,540
figured out,

3967
01:40:32,540 --> 01:40:33,450
keep the pressure on them,

3968
01:40:33,451 --> 01:40:34,500
throw a lot of leg kicks,

3969
01:40:34,501 --> 01:40:35,430
throw combinations,

3970
01:40:35,490 --> 01:40:38,460
rip that left hook to the body
and eventually took them out.

3971
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:40,080
And once he presses him
into the corner too,

3972
01:40:40,081 --> 01:40:40,914
there's no escape.

3973
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:41,310
And he's got,

3974
01:40:41,310 --> 01:40:43,110
he's got that nice
switch knee to the face.

3975
01:40:43,170 --> 01:40:45,150
And the Raymond Daniels
is an interesting case.

3976
01:40:45,151 --> 01:40:45,361
He didn't,

3977
01:40:45,361 --> 01:40:46,110
do you know who he is?

3978
01:40:46,110 --> 01:40:46,943
Yes,

3979
01:40:47,010 --> 01:40:47,843
he's wise.

3980
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,590
They fought twice and he
stopped in both times.

3981
01:40:49,950 --> 01:40:50,161
You know,

3982
01:40:50,161 --> 01:40:54,070
Raymond Daniels is an interesting case
because there's a guy who was at leat at

3983
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:55,810
a very odd style of fighting.

3984
01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:59,200
He was elite at point karate
and if you watch his point,

3985
01:40:59,201 --> 01:41:00,400
karate fights online,

3986
01:41:00,410 --> 01:41:03,760
you realize like God it's guy just
blitz is in with this crazy shit.

3987
01:41:03,761 --> 01:41:07,510
And then they would stop it and point cry
for people don't know is like a really

3988
01:41:07,540 --> 01:41:12,010
high level game of tag with karate
because once you touch the guy,

3989
01:41:12,011 --> 01:41:12,970
like literally touch them,

3990
01:41:12,971 --> 01:41:14,980
they stop it and they score the point.

3991
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:20,160
So it's very difficult to transition
from that into continuous fighting.

3992
01:41:21,430 --> 01:41:26,170
Like when you fight in
kickboxing or Thai or an MMA,

3993
01:41:26,380 --> 01:41:27,191
when you hit a guy,

3994
01:41:27,191 --> 01:41:28,480
once he hits you back,

3995
01:41:28,481 --> 01:41:31,690
you hit him again and it's all about
hitting and not being hit and movement.

3996
01:41:31,691 --> 01:41:32,200
What,

3997
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:36,700
what karate would they get really good
at is this blitz where they jump on you

3998
01:41:36,701 --> 01:41:37,480
and to attack,

3999
01:41:37,480 --> 01:41:41,200
but they have to get used to hitting
back and the referee not stopping the

4000
01:41:41,201 --> 01:41:42,034
action.

4001
01:41:42,040 --> 01:41:43,870
So credits or Raymond Daniels,

4002
01:41:44,110 --> 01:41:49,110
he went from doing this one style of
like jumping in and hitting a guy once to

4003
01:41:50,770 --> 01:41:54,760
this continuous stock and
then also factor in leg kicks.

4004
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:57,610
Cause in these karate tournaments
you can't kick the legs.

4005
01:41:57,760 --> 01:42:02,760
So he's jumping in with all these wild
kicking and punching techniques and then

4006
01:42:03,640 --> 01:42:07,900
he goes from that to this
incredibly difficult,

4007
01:42:07,901 --> 01:42:09,940
grueling style of fighting.

4008
01:42:10,150 --> 01:42:11,950
The guys have their hands up very high.

4009
01:42:11,951 --> 01:42:13,660
The throwing a lot of leg kicks and,

4010
01:42:13,900 --> 01:42:18,670
and he's excelled at it except at the
very elite level when he's fought the very

4011
01:42:18,671 --> 01:42:20,710
best guys like Joseph
optoline stopped him.

4012
01:42:20,830 --> 01:42:21,610
Same thing,

4013
01:42:21,610 --> 01:42:22,600
attack the legs,

4014
01:42:22,601 --> 01:42:23,380
attack place,

4015
01:42:23,380 --> 01:42:25,090
get them to block the leg goes up high,

4016
01:42:25,091 --> 01:42:25,924
it head kicks him.

4017
01:42:26,110 --> 01:42:31,110
But it's utilizing the Moy Thai style
to defeat this style where he just,

4018
01:42:31,990 --> 01:42:33,790
he's got so many tools,

4019
01:42:33,940 --> 01:42:38,860
but it doesn't quite have all of
it together at a world class level.

4020
01:42:39,610 --> 01:42:41,290
Let the guy fight on the outside,

4021
01:42:41,650 --> 01:42:41,891
man,

4022
01:42:41,891 --> 01:42:45,160
he's got that blitz blitz
in those wild kicks.

4023
01:42:45,161 --> 01:42:46,150
He's really interesting.

4024
01:42:46,170 --> 01:42:46,450
Yeah.

4025
01:42:46,450 --> 01:42:48,370
Very Unorthodox edits.

4026
01:42:48,430 --> 01:42:49,300
The spins.

4027
01:42:49,540 --> 01:42:50,050
Yeah.

4028
01:42:50,050 --> 01:42:50,883
And the jumping,

4029
01:42:50,950 --> 01:42:51,940
but you've got to wonder man,

4030
01:42:51,941 --> 01:42:52,151
man,

4031
01:42:52,151 --> 01:42:54,340
with a guy with those type of skills,

4032
01:42:54,640 --> 01:42:58,680
if he could get his hands at the same
level as like a niche Niki holds can or a

4033
01:42:58,700 --> 01:43:02,290
valine and get those leg kicks at
the level that those guys have,

4034
01:43:02,291 --> 01:43:02,520
like,

4035
01:43:02,520 --> 01:43:03,350
Ooh,

4036
01:43:03,350 --> 01:43:04,183
you man.

4037
01:43:04,940 --> 01:43:05,181
Yeah,

4038
01:43:05,181 --> 01:43:05,330
no,

4039
01:43:05,330 --> 01:43:05,901
it's crazy.

4040
01:43:05,901 --> 01:43:06,710
He's um,

4041
01:43:06,710 --> 01:43:07,190
yeah.

4042
01:43:07,190 --> 01:43:07,530
Yeah.

4043
01:43:07,530 --> 01:43:08,420
But then Nikki Holsten,

4044
01:43:08,421 --> 01:43:09,254
he's a,

4045
01:43:09,260 --> 01:43:10,790
I don't know how anyone
can fight him right now.

4046
01:43:10,791 --> 01:43:13,790
He's probably the the king
at that weight division.

4047
01:43:14,450 --> 01:43:15,170
Yeah.

4048
01:43:15,170 --> 01:43:15,401
There's,

4049
01:43:15,401 --> 01:43:17,180
so there's a lot of talent and glory.

4050
01:43:17,181 --> 01:43:19,910
It's a really drives me nuts to seeing,

4051
01:43:19,940 --> 01:43:22,730
seeing that them leaving spike TV,

4052
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:24,020
I'd really bums me out.

4053
01:43:24,021 --> 01:43:26,570
I don't know what's gonna happen now
because the without them and the prize

4054
01:43:26,571 --> 01:43:30,680
money we had the again and B that
they exposure where what happens now,

4055
01:43:30,681 --> 01:43:32,910
what happens to the lion fights.

4056
01:43:32,950 --> 01:43:35,330
They're only channel to
go near like I suppose.

4057
01:43:35,331 --> 01:43:38,720
And their ability is doing the kickboxing
version as well with their last show

4058
01:43:38,721 --> 01:43:40,070
with the ring in the cage.

4059
01:43:40,520 --> 01:43:41,480
So that was interesting.

4060
01:43:41,481 --> 01:43:43,160
And that was combined with glory.

4061
01:43:43,200 --> 01:43:43,590
Yeah.

4062
01:43:43,590 --> 01:43:44,181
I suppose.

4063
01:43:44,181 --> 01:43:44,630
Yeah,

4064
01:43:44,630 --> 01:43:46,520
I think that that was
what they were doing.

4065
01:43:46,521 --> 01:43:47,060
You know what I mean?

4066
01:43:47,060 --> 01:43:50,450
They were just trying to have like a
big crazy like Japanese style event,

4067
01:43:50,480 --> 01:43:51,313
you know?

4068
01:43:51,530 --> 01:43:51,980
I don't know

4069
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:52,490
man.

4070
01:43:52,490 --> 01:43:53,510
It just bums me out.

4071
01:43:53,810 --> 01:43:57,170
It just bums me out that it for
whatever reason it didn't catch on.

4072
01:43:57,320 --> 01:43:57,890
Yup.

4073
01:43:57,890 --> 01:43:58,450
Yup.

4074
01:43:58,450 --> 01:43:59,283
You know,

4075
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:01,640
and spike is obviously
where the UFC took off.

4076
01:44:01,641 --> 01:44:03,260
So it's not like it can't happen there,

4077
01:44:04,010 --> 01:44:05,330
but whatever reason it just didn't.

4078
01:44:06,300 --> 01:44:06,620
Yeah,

4079
01:44:06,620 --> 01:44:06,951
I say,

4080
01:44:06,951 --> 01:44:07,350
yeah,

4081
01:44:07,350 --> 01:44:08,090
it's hard.

4082
01:44:08,090 --> 01:44:08,510
It's hard.

4083
01:44:08,510 --> 01:44:09,130
It's hard for us.

4084
01:44:09,130 --> 01:44:10,520
Strike is we um,

4085
01:44:11,350 --> 01:44:11,570
Eh,

4086
01:44:11,570 --> 01:44:13,940
have they get the Steel Cup on
the corners in between flights?

4087
01:44:13,941 --> 01:44:14,731
They didn't Tingler Jean,

4088
01:44:14,731 --> 01:44:15,600
any good need change?

4089
01:44:17,980 --> 01:44:19,010
Pass the hat around.

4090
01:44:19,490 --> 01:44:20,630
What about in Holland?

4091
01:44:20,631 --> 01:44:20,820
Is,

4092
01:44:20,820 --> 01:44:23,300
is it they make money at Holland fighting,

4093
01:44:23,330 --> 01:44:24,163
I believe.

4094
01:44:24,440 --> 01:44:25,370
Uh,

4095
01:44:25,371 --> 01:44:28,370
they shut down all the big shows as
a massive show called showtime with,

4096
01:44:28,610 --> 01:44:28,960
well,

4097
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:33,650
half a football stadium and I believe
that had like 30 to 40,000 people that

4098
01:44:33,651 --> 01:44:35,840
would come to these events
three or four times a year.

4099
01:44:36,260 --> 01:44:40,550
And then apparently the hell's angels
were involved with a little bit of

4100
01:44:40,551 --> 01:44:42,260
Washington washing this and that.

4101
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:42,711
And then,

4102
01:44:42,711 --> 01:44:43,070
um,

4103
01:44:43,070 --> 01:44:44,900
they got banned from doing the big shows.

4104
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:47,540
So that's why there's nothing
happening in Hollindale.

4105
01:44:48,160 --> 01:44:48,650
Yeah.

4106
01:44:48,650 --> 01:44:49,100
Again,

4107
01:44:49,100 --> 01:44:49,580
again,

4108
01:44:49,580 --> 01:44:51,470
it was that that was the place to go.

4109
01:44:51,471 --> 01:44:55,570
Hollen and showtime and Cosmo was a
former showtime champion also in about a

4110
01:44:55,610 --> 01:44:57,830
hiree love.

4111
01:44:57,831 --> 01:44:58,664
Watch that.

4112
01:44:58,850 --> 01:45:00,090
He's fucking crazy.

4113
01:45:00,110 --> 01:45:02,300
Send me shield or crazy killers.

4114
01:45:02,660 --> 01:45:03,320
All the Dutch.

4115
01:45:03,320 --> 01:45:04,640
It was such an amazing show.

4116
01:45:04,641 --> 01:45:06,920
And then because they're
knocked on the head now there's,

4117
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:07,920
where do you go?

4118
01:45:07,940 --> 01:45:09,180
They'd like that was the,

4119
01:45:09,320 --> 01:45:09,860
besides,

4120
01:45:09,860 --> 01:45:10,160
um,

4121
01:45:10,160 --> 01:45:10,880
Thailand.

4122
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:12,800
Holland was at that place and now,

4123
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:14,300
now that's dried up.

4124
01:45:14,810 --> 01:45:18,530
Now it seems that maybe Japanese can
fucking pick up the slack and come back

4125
01:45:18,531 --> 01:45:19,370
with k one again.

4126
01:45:19,820 --> 01:45:21,950
Cause I know they're trying
to do a new MMA promotion.

4127
01:45:21,951 --> 01:45:23,270
They have fade or for new years.

4128
01:45:23,271 --> 01:45:23,900
Yes,

4129
01:45:23,900 --> 01:45:24,680
but here's the problem.

4130
01:45:24,680 --> 01:45:28,220
There's no heavyweight talent out there
that can't find fate or an opponent.

4131
01:45:28,260 --> 01:45:32,360
Someone said he's opponents for
flights or something with two.

4132
01:45:32,370 --> 01:45:32,871
Well that guy,

4133
01:45:32,871 --> 01:45:33,860
they pulled that guy out.

4134
01:45:34,220 --> 01:45:35,300
Apparently he's not in shape.

4135
01:45:35,301 --> 01:45:35,631
That was,

4136
01:45:35,631 --> 01:45:35,901
that was,

4137
01:45:35,901 --> 01:45:36,021
uh,

4138
01:45:36,021 --> 01:45:36,980
an Indian gentleman,

4139
01:45:36,981 --> 01:45:37,910
I believe from India.

4140
01:45:38,890 --> 01:45:39,380
I don't even,

4141
01:45:39,380 --> 01:45:40,161
I know who he is,

4142
01:45:40,161 --> 01:45:40,611
but he's not,

4143
01:45:40,611 --> 01:45:42,020
he's just not world class.

4144
01:45:42,021 --> 01:45:42,410
It's not,

4145
01:45:42,410 --> 01:45:45,040
not for a guy like fate or like,

4146
01:45:45,041 --> 01:45:45,290
you know,

4147
01:45:45,290 --> 01:45:48,200
you're talking about arguably the greatest
heavyweight of all time and you're

4148
01:45:48,201 --> 01:45:52,340
going to have him fight a guy who's
just nowhere near his league for a New

4149
01:45:52,340 --> 01:45:52,761
Year's eve show.

4150
01:45:52,761 --> 01:45:53,594
That's crazy.

4151
01:45:53,670 --> 01:45:55,220
You need world class talent.

4152
01:45:55,530 --> 01:45:56,920
There was so much excitement when they,

4153
01:45:56,921 --> 01:45:57,220
he,

4154
01:45:57,220 --> 01:45:57,891
he and he answered,

4155
01:45:57,891 --> 01:46:01,260
he was coming back and then there was
the 20 supposed to fight in the UFC what

4156
01:46:01,300 --> 01:46:01,890
supposed to,

4157
01:46:01,890 --> 01:46:04,910
and it was talking to the UFC then there
was still good but going to Bella toy

4158
01:46:04,911 --> 01:46:07,160
and then he was going to make
the big announcement and then,

4159
01:46:07,161 --> 01:46:07,730
um,

4160
01:46:07,730 --> 01:46:08,150
and then,

4161
01:46:08,150 --> 01:46:08,451
okay,

4162
01:46:08,451 --> 01:46:09,284
and we're going to Japan.

4163
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:12,380
Well I think at least spike
TV's going to air the fight.

4164
01:46:12,381 --> 01:46:16,310
I think they did something in
conjunction with Spike TV for,

4165
01:46:16,340 --> 01:46:17,173
for this event.

4166
01:46:17,510 --> 01:46:18,710
So I believe,

4167
01:46:18,860 --> 01:46:19,693
I don't want to,

4168
01:46:20,360 --> 01:46:24,140
I'm pretty sure that it's in
conjunction with Spike TV.

4169
01:46:24,170 --> 01:46:24,710
Okay.

4170
01:46:24,710 --> 01:46:25,240
The fate or,

4171
01:46:25,240 --> 01:46:26,510
but who the fuck is he going to fight?

4172
01:46:26,750 --> 01:46:30,100
There's no one out there unless Randy
coture comes out of retirement and then

4173
01:46:30,101 --> 01:46:31,310
then Randy's 50,

4174
01:46:31,311 --> 01:46:32,940
whatever years old and you're gonna need,

4175
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:33,220
uh,

4176
01:46:33,220 --> 01:46:35,030
a strong undercut to support it as well.

4177
01:46:35,031 --> 01:46:35,870
And everybody's signed.

4178
01:46:35,900 --> 01:46:37,570
Everyone saw it would be the ability to,

4179
01:46:37,580 --> 01:46:42,580
or UFC or it's crazy time or world series
of fighting between those three shows.

4180
01:46:42,681 --> 01:46:43,700
They have everybody,

4181
01:46:44,740 --> 01:46:45,110
me,

4182
01:46:45,110 --> 01:46:47,270
Bella toward doesn't even really
have a heavyweight champion.

4183
01:46:47,570 --> 01:46:49,090
He never see their
heavyweight champion fighting.

4184
01:46:49,100 --> 01:46:49,750
Who the fuck is there?

4185
01:46:49,750 --> 01:46:50,070
Heavyweight

4186
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:50,903
champion.

4187
01:46:51,030 --> 01:46:51,541
You know what I mean?

4188
01:46:51,541 --> 01:46:52,290
It's like,

4189
01:46:52,290 --> 01:46:53,390
I don't think the guy has fun.

4190
01:46:53,400 --> 01:46:54,420
I don't think they're
heavyweight champion.

4191
01:46:54,421 --> 01:46:56,580
He's fought and like two years
or something crazy like that.

4192
01:46:57,360 --> 01:46:58,410
It's a mass man.

4193
01:46:58,440 --> 01:46:59,490
It really is a mess.

4194
01:46:59,550 --> 01:47:00,230
It's just this.

4195
01:47:00,230 --> 01:47:01,440
It's very unfortunate.

4196
01:47:01,740 --> 01:47:02,573
I would like,

4197
01:47:04,330 --> 01:47:04,860
you know,

4198
01:47:04,860 --> 01:47:08,840
I'd like to see him fight
a quality opponent if he's
going to come back and get

4199
01:47:08,850 --> 01:47:09,870
definitely like the,

4200
01:47:09,900 --> 01:47:10,681
like the pri days.

4201
01:47:10,681 --> 01:47:11,514
That would have been amazing.

4202
01:47:11,910 --> 01:47:12,240
Well,

4203
01:47:12,240 --> 01:47:12,541
you know,

4204
01:47:12,541 --> 01:47:13,440
they did it before.

4205
01:47:13,441 --> 01:47:14,610
Why can't they do it again?

4206
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:15,570
You know?

4207
01:47:15,570 --> 01:47:15,901
I mean,

4208
01:47:15,901 --> 01:47:17,940
I think it's gotta be,

4209
01:47:18,420 --> 01:47:20,930
there's gotta be some upstarts,

4210
01:47:20,931 --> 01:47:25,260
some young up and coming fighters out
there all over the world that are very

4211
01:47:25,261 --> 01:47:25,861
talented.

4212
01:47:25,861 --> 01:47:30,120
It's a matter of how having a quality
talent scout who really is deep in the

4213
01:47:30,121 --> 01:47:30,541
game,

4214
01:47:30,541 --> 01:47:31,770
who understands fighting,

4215
01:47:32,010 --> 01:47:36,300
who can go out there and recruit those
guys at a young age and then have,

4216
01:47:36,450 --> 01:47:37,740
well the Japanese also,

4217
01:47:37,741 --> 01:47:42,741
there's another angle that must be
considered is that the Japanese became big

4218
01:47:43,050 --> 01:47:48,050
that the organization's by having pro
wrestlers fight in MMA matches like Takada

4219
01:47:49,050 --> 01:47:54,050
went to codified Hixon Gracie Hixon Gracie
was the man in the fucking Brazilian

4220
01:47:55,231 --> 01:47:56,100
Jujitsu world,

4221
01:47:56,130 --> 01:47:56,670
right?

4222
01:47:56,670 --> 01:47:58,590
And he was the man in the Gracie world.

4223
01:47:58,591 --> 01:48:00,990
Like when hoists Gracie
was winning the UFC,

4224
01:48:00,991 --> 01:48:01,591
he always said,

4225
01:48:01,591 --> 01:48:01,831
listen,

4226
01:48:01,831 --> 01:48:03,360
my brother is 10 times better than me.

4227
01:48:03,690 --> 01:48:04,650
And he always said that.

4228
01:48:04,680 --> 01:48:08,370
And then his brother goes and fights
for Japan valley to doe and becomes a

4229
01:48:08,371 --> 01:48:09,390
superstar in Japan.

4230
01:48:09,391 --> 01:48:10,320
And then his brother,

4231
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:15,300
people don't know Hixon fought in the
very first pride Hixon fought Takata.

4232
01:48:15,660 --> 01:48:18,210
And so when Hickson was fighting in Japan,

4233
01:48:18,211 --> 01:48:21,480
Hickson was a superstar to Kata
was a pro wrestling superstar.

4234
01:48:21,660 --> 01:48:23,760
And that's what made pride takeoff.

4235
01:48:23,970 --> 01:48:28,950
And then obviously they were doing these
gigantic arena site Tonah super arena

4236
01:48:28,951 --> 01:48:32,460
and just a huge fucking venues
in New Year's Eve shows.

4237
01:48:32,461 --> 01:48:33,294
And

4238
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:36,270
they have to figure out
how to rebuild that.

4239
01:48:36,271 --> 01:48:40,200
But I don't even think pro wrestling
is where it's at in any more in Japan.

4240
01:48:40,230 --> 01:48:41,190
I think Japan,

4241
01:48:41,340 --> 01:48:42,300
they get fickle.

4242
01:48:42,630 --> 01:48:43,110
You know,

4243
01:48:43,110 --> 01:48:43,921
these young kids,

4244
01:48:43,921 --> 01:48:44,790
they dressed like Elvis,

4245
01:48:44,791 --> 01:48:47,400
they dye their hair
purple and then next year,

4246
01:48:47,610 --> 01:48:47,911
you know,

4247
01:48:47,911 --> 01:48:51,090
they become accountants and they know
that's the only thing they have like these

4248
01:48:51,091 --> 01:48:52,410
weird fabs that get into,

4249
01:48:52,670 --> 01:48:53,503
um,

4250
01:48:53,540 --> 01:48:53,880
oh,

4251
01:48:53,880 --> 01:48:54,750
what's the gentleman that

4252
01:48:56,360 --> 01:48:56,760
uh,

4253
01:48:56,760 --> 01:48:57,450
gunky pseudo.

4254
01:48:57,450 --> 01:48:58,050
Yeah,

4255
01:48:58,050 --> 01:49:01,300
he tended to the the singer
rocks the robot dancing.

4256
01:49:02,270 --> 01:49:02,880
Yeah,

4257
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:03,341
exactly.

4258
01:49:03,341 --> 01:49:04,990
Like you're saying what fun day here.

4259
01:49:04,991 --> 01:49:07,100
And it may serve as a my tight.

4260
01:49:07,170 --> 01:49:07,320
Yeah.

4261
01:49:07,320 --> 01:49:08,260
Well his MMA as well.

4262
01:49:08,261 --> 01:49:08,480
He was,

4263
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:08,890
yeah,

4264
01:49:08,890 --> 01:49:10,150
he was everything very good.

4265
01:49:10,151 --> 01:49:14,250
Grab One MMA and all of a
sudden he's doing rockstar.

4266
01:49:14,380 --> 01:49:14,591
Yeah,

4267
01:49:14,591 --> 01:49:15,050
he's there.

4268
01:49:15,050 --> 01:49:16,090
He's a character.

4269
01:49:16,450 --> 01:49:17,080
He's the main,

4270
01:49:17,080 --> 01:49:17,410
he was,

4271
01:49:17,410 --> 01:49:18,250
he was a what?

4272
01:49:18,251 --> 01:49:18,830
Connie do that,

4273
01:49:18,830 --> 01:49:19,690
but that was awesome.

4274
01:49:19,850 --> 01:49:21,820
But he's also been in MMA.

4275
01:49:21,821 --> 01:49:22,301
He fought,

4276
01:49:22,301 --> 01:49:22,571
he,

4277
01:49:22,571 --> 01:49:22,780
um,

4278
01:49:22,780 --> 01:49:25,660
got him in the heavyweight boxer.

4279
01:49:25,690 --> 01:49:27,070
He did the jumping back,

4280
01:49:27,071 --> 01:49:28,660
kick off the top rope and then um,

4281
01:49:28,661 --> 01:49:29,620
got him in a heel hook.

4282
01:49:29,621 --> 01:49:31,840
I bought it and then I'm there.

4283
01:49:31,841 --> 01:49:32,470
That was nuts.

4284
01:49:32,470 --> 01:49:33,730
And he was outweighed by like,

4285
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:34,451
fuck,

4286
01:49:34,451 --> 01:49:34,930
that's crazy.

4287
01:49:34,930 --> 01:49:36,610
Lease 150 pounds,

4288
01:49:36,611 --> 01:49:37,200
right?

4289
01:49:37,200 --> 01:49:38,980
Butter beans gotta be 300 pounds.

4290
01:49:39,010 --> 01:49:39,700
Yeah.

4291
01:49:39,700 --> 01:49:40,630
Plus madness.

4292
01:49:40,690 --> 01:49:41,201
Pure Madden.

4293
01:49:41,201 --> 01:49:43,360
And then how do I have the
promoter can stay there?

4294
01:49:43,510 --> 01:49:43,970
Uh,

4295
01:49:43,970 --> 01:49:44,890
I've got a good match.

4296
01:49:45,130 --> 01:49:45,751
What are the,

4297
01:49:45,751 --> 01:49:47,310
what it was we say,

4298
01:49:47,311 --> 01:49:49,390
how do you even justify putting that on?

4299
01:49:49,391 --> 01:49:50,420
And then sitting back and going,

4300
01:49:50,430 --> 01:49:51,263
I wasn't going to be awesome.

4301
01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:53,280
It's just put on a lot
of freak shows in Japan.

4302
01:49:53,300 --> 01:49:54,133
Let it freak chaise.

4303
01:49:54,430 --> 01:49:56,830
That was one of the other things
that they did to attract attention.

4304
01:49:56,831 --> 01:50:00,190
They had guys that were fighting
guys way smaller than him,

4305
01:50:00,820 --> 01:50:01,331
you know,

4306
01:50:01,331 --> 01:50:01,711
like,

4307
01:50:01,711 --> 01:50:02,380
um,

4308
01:50:02,380 --> 01:50:03,350
oh the tie there.

4309
01:50:03,370 --> 01:50:04,620
I remember the Thai King,

4310
01:50:04,700 --> 01:50:05,240
ah,

4311
01:50:05,240 --> 01:50:06,130
mighty Mo.

4312
01:50:06,900 --> 01:50:07,733
Uh,

4313
01:50:07,900 --> 01:50:08,291
fuck.

4314
01:50:08,291 --> 01:50:09,124
What's his name?

4315
01:50:10,420 --> 01:50:11,530
Cal Clay.

4316
01:50:11,560 --> 01:50:12,393
Yes.

4317
01:50:12,440 --> 01:50:13,180
Alkali.

4318
01:50:13,180 --> 01:50:14,710
Calculated the jumping down,

4319
01:50:14,740 --> 01:50:15,573
ran hockey,

4320
01:50:16,030 --> 01:50:19,540
and then put the leg back and hitting
with the heel and on the way down,

4321
01:50:20,050 --> 01:50:21,130
I think he was that way,

4322
01:50:21,131 --> 01:50:26,131
but at least 70 killers and least
the least mo was all bomber too.

4323
01:50:28,870 --> 01:50:29,501
It was a,

4324
01:50:29,501 --> 01:50:30,220
that was like,

4325
01:50:30,220 --> 01:50:30,880
uh,

4326
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:33,160
[inaudible] we're going
to see someone get killed,

4327
01:50:33,550 --> 01:50:34,720
but mighty Mo was going to,

4328
01:50:34,740 --> 01:50:35,260
uh,

4329
01:50:35,260 --> 01:50:35,940
put him in school.

4330
01:50:35,940 --> 01:50:37,710
I would fight with his hands down to,

4331
01:50:38,260 --> 01:50:39,760
he was like a taekwondo fighter.

4332
01:50:39,761 --> 01:50:40,660
It was crazy.

4333
01:50:41,170 --> 01:50:42,330
He was fighting them regularly.

4334
01:50:42,331 --> 01:50:45,910
He fought out homie and
joy from the seven foot,

4335
01:50:45,911 --> 01:50:47,080
two blue hair,

4336
01:50:47,200 --> 01:50:48,033
one stuff,

4337
01:50:48,280 --> 01:50:49,900
and then should have beaten him too.

4338
01:50:49,901 --> 01:50:50,081
But,

4339
01:50:50,081 --> 01:50:51,190
but they wanted to create him.

4340
01:50:51,240 --> 01:50:53,230
They tried to build a man show episode,

4341
01:50:53,231 --> 01:50:54,400
become the next k one star.

4342
01:50:54,640 --> 01:50:55,391
But in theory,

4343
01:50:55,391 --> 01:50:56,140
if you watch the fight,

4344
01:50:56,140 --> 01:50:56,510
um,

4345
01:50:56,510 --> 01:50:57,640
calculus should have won that one,

4346
01:50:58,210 --> 01:50:58,900
the 70,

4347
01:50:58,900 --> 01:51:03,900
76 kilo five foot 10 times versus
seven foot two Korean beast.

4348
01:51:05,710 --> 01:51:10,130
And then landed a head kick to see one
of the photos where his legs completely

4349
01:51:10,140 --> 01:51:11,280
virtually split.

4350
01:51:11,300 --> 01:51:12,133
Yeah.

4351
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:13,060
Yeah.

4352
01:51:13,060 --> 01:51:14,560
What happened at k one Max.

4353
01:51:14,561 --> 01:51:16,160
They had some wild fights over there.

4354
01:51:16,161 --> 01:51:18,840
I remember one Masato was over
those and Caitlin for two years,

4355
01:51:18,870 --> 01:51:21,250
can Vince Phillips came over the former,

4356
01:51:21,251 --> 01:51:24,280
a boxing champion and Pharma
sites on a kickboxing fight.

4357
01:51:24,440 --> 01:51:26,380
He got his legs destroyed and he fought,

4358
01:51:26,381 --> 01:51:27,100
um,

4359
01:51:27,100 --> 01:51:27,670
ah,

4360
01:51:27,670 --> 01:51:29,980
the handsome MMA guy as well.

4361
01:51:30,330 --> 01:51:31,630
He fights for UFC also.

4362
01:51:31,720 --> 01:51:32,051
Oh,

4363
01:51:32,051 --> 01:51:32,884
what's his name?

4364
01:51:33,010 --> 01:51:36,760
Can you please tell me your
name and some 60 Yammer.

4365
01:51:37,090 --> 01:51:37,811
Oh,

4366
01:51:37,811 --> 01:51:39,690
foot 60 [inaudible] mail.

4367
01:51:39,970 --> 01:51:40,803
See what happens.

4368
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:42,273
Yeah.

4369
01:51:42,280 --> 01:51:42,530
Oh,

4370
01:51:42,530 --> 01:51:44,140
how Vince was it Vince?

4371
01:51:44,141 --> 01:51:47,290
He fought one of the books or
one of the boxes from America.

4372
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:49,300
So he's come over a fight,

4373
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:50,193
MMA,

4374
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:51,460
MMA for the first time,

4375
01:51:51,461 --> 01:51:54,040
and then we'll catching a
lift together in the hotel.

4376
01:51:54,460 --> 01:51:55,151
And I asked him,

4377
01:51:55,151 --> 01:51:55,390
I said,

4378
01:51:55,390 --> 01:51:55,511
oh,

4379
01:51:55,511 --> 01:51:55,781
I say,

4380
01:51:55,781 --> 01:51:56,531
what's your game plan?

4381
01:51:56,531 --> 01:51:57,760
Have you been doing much MMA?

4382
01:51:57,790 --> 01:51:58,450
And he goes,

4383
01:51:58,450 --> 01:52:00,250
I'm just going to treat
it like a street fight.

4384
01:52:00,350 --> 01:52:00,630
Oh,

4385
01:52:00,630 --> 01:52:01,160
I'm just gonna.

4386
01:52:01,160 --> 01:52:03,460
I'm just gonna Punch that
mother fucker in the face.

4387
01:52:03,461 --> 01:52:06,160
And once he realizes
my power and it's like,

4388
01:52:06,240 --> 01:52:06,980
oh,

4389
01:52:06,980 --> 01:52:09,280
it's like I gave him a tap on
the shoulder and it's like,

4390
01:52:09,281 --> 01:52:09,521
Oh,

4391
01:52:09,521 --> 01:52:10,354
good luck with that.

4392
01:52:10,620 --> 01:52:10,910
And then,

4393
01:52:10,910 --> 01:52:11,320
uh,

4394
01:52:11,320 --> 01:52:11,681
and then,

4395
01:52:11,681 --> 01:52:15,130
and then after the fight we caught the
same lift back to the room and I was

4396
01:52:15,131 --> 01:52:16,720
mother fucking Japanese set me up,

4397
01:52:16,721 --> 01:52:17,171
man.

4398
01:52:17,171 --> 01:52:17,351
Day,

4399
01:52:17,351 --> 01:52:17,921
new day,

4400
01:52:17,921 --> 01:52:18,671
new damn right.

4401
01:52:18,671 --> 01:52:23,080
I had no chance in hell and
that fight like did you expect,

4402
01:52:23,081 --> 01:52:24,080
of course you're going to see.

4403
01:52:24,130 --> 01:52:28,120
And then the funny thing was he was
talking to Holla at them press conference

4404
01:52:28,540 --> 01:52:29,830
and then Francoise both,

4405
01:52:30,370 --> 01:52:31,190
not both or no,

4406
01:52:31,190 --> 01:52:31,400
no.

4407
01:52:31,400 --> 01:52:32,500
He fired both of though.

4408
01:52:32,820 --> 01:52:33,610
There was a,

4409
01:52:33,610 --> 01:52:38,610
he submitted him and both of was a former
boxing champion who fought k one he

4410
01:52:38,771 --> 01:52:39,970
came from,

4411
01:52:40,060 --> 01:52:41,470
he was an American boxer from,

4412
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:42,580
I believe it was Texas.

4413
01:52:43,090 --> 01:52:45,140
He for 60,

4414
01:52:46,220 --> 01:52:48,110
I think it was 2005.

4415
01:52:48,940 --> 01:52:52,160
Uh Oh fuck it was,

4416
01:52:52,220 --> 01:52:53,053
yeah.

4417
01:52:53,060 --> 01:52:53,611
So any,

4418
01:52:53,611 --> 01:52:54,200
any way?

4419
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:55,033
Um,

4420
01:52:55,550 --> 01:52:55,800
yeah,

4421
01:52:55,800 --> 01:52:57,170
the press conference is
talking all this stuff.

4422
01:52:57,171 --> 01:53:00,460
So during the fight there
were so many times at the,

4423
01:53:00,520 --> 01:53:04,020
the American boxer was given his
arm and then he just pushed the,

4424
01:53:04,210 --> 01:53:07,250
the way and just rang rain down
punches more and more and more.

4425
01:53:07,490 --> 01:53:08,330
He wanted to punish him.

4426
01:53:08,331 --> 01:53:08,571
I said,

4427
01:53:08,571 --> 01:53:08,960
it's happening.

4428
01:53:08,960 --> 01:53:10,850
Me It was um,

4429
01:53:10,880 --> 01:53:11,510
it was quite,

4430
01:53:11,510 --> 01:53:12,291
quite crazy.

4431
01:53:12,291 --> 01:53:13,520
He doesn't know who the fuck are was.

4432
01:53:13,521 --> 01:53:14,331
I'm looking at his,

4433
01:53:14,331 --> 01:53:14,720
um,

4434
01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:18,020
his record and I don't see anybody
in there that I recognize as a,

4435
01:53:18,021 --> 01:53:18,560
uh,

4436
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:18,971
as a book.

4437
01:53:18,971 --> 01:53:20,630
So Michael [inaudible],

4438
01:53:22,380 --> 01:53:23,270
I don't know who that is.

4439
01:53:23,690 --> 01:53:23,991
Yeah.

4440
01:53:23,991 --> 01:53:27,110
It was like a special cause it cause it
was k one card as well as Kevin Mex card

4441
01:53:27,111 --> 01:53:28,550
and they threw in an MMA fight.

4442
01:53:28,551 --> 01:53:30,500
They're just for shits and giggles.

4443
01:53:30,690 --> 01:53:31,401
K One max.

4444
01:53:31,401 --> 01:53:32,161
It was Michael.

4445
01:53:32,161 --> 01:53:32,471
Irma.

4446
01:53:32,471 --> 01:53:33,480
I don't know who that dude is all,

4447
01:53:33,481 --> 01:53:34,170
I don't know.

4448
01:53:34,170 --> 01:53:36,850
Well let me Google him real quick
cause your American flag beside it.

4449
01:53:37,340 --> 01:53:38,173
Yup.

4450
01:53:38,260 --> 01:53:38,630
Yeah.

4451
01:53:38,630 --> 01:53:39,590
He's a boxer.

4452
01:53:39,591 --> 01:53:39,890
Yup.

4453
01:53:39,890 --> 01:53:42,080
Visit Page k one.

4454
01:53:42,320 --> 01:53:42,621
Yeah,

4455
01:53:42,621 --> 01:53:43,454
that's who it was.

4456
01:53:43,970 --> 01:53:44,690
That's who it was.

4457
01:53:44,690 --> 01:53:45,980
Iron Horse Boxing Club.

4458
01:53:46,010 --> 01:53:46,310
Yup.

4459
01:53:46,310 --> 01:53:47,000
That's him.

4460
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:48,110
I'm just going to cook reserves.

4461
01:53:51,300 --> 01:53:51,621
Yeah.

4462
01:53:51,621 --> 01:53:52,454
That uh,

4463
01:53:53,530 --> 01:53:54,363
yeah.

4464
01:53:56,120 --> 01:53:57,470
And then that they do it all the time.

4465
01:53:57,471 --> 01:54:01,910
That also they had a Japanese boxer
verse Macedo as well and the same deal as

4466
01:54:01,911 --> 01:54:02,180
well.

4467
01:54:02,180 --> 01:54:04,310
He didn't learn how to check on the side.

4468
01:54:04,311 --> 01:54:06,380
I just went in there and
just destroyed his legs.

4469
01:54:06,470 --> 01:54:08,110
Masada was an excellent fighter.

4470
01:54:08,150 --> 01:54:08,901
He was in a very,

4471
01:54:08,901 --> 01:54:09,590
very good,

4472
01:54:09,590 --> 01:54:09,861
he's,

4473
01:54:09,861 --> 01:54:10,430
um,

4474
01:54:10,430 --> 01:54:11,120
he's,

4475
01:54:11,120 --> 01:54:11,750
uh,

4476
01:54:11,750 --> 01:54:14,670
he was the man that every single
person wanted to fight because he,

4477
01:54:14,870 --> 01:54:19,070
he was the one that was rocking up to
the Wayne's in a Ferrari and he was the

4478
01:54:19,070 --> 01:54:20,480
Conor Mcgregor of MMA back,

4479
01:54:20,500 --> 01:54:20,720
uh,

4480
01:54:20,720 --> 01:54:20,871
of,

4481
01:54:20,871 --> 01:54:21,510
of Caitlin.

4482
01:54:21,510 --> 01:54:21,860
Sorry.

4483
01:54:21,860 --> 01:54:22,650
But he wasn't talking.

4484
01:54:22,650 --> 01:54:23,570
Was he talking shit,

4485
01:54:23,630 --> 01:54:24,463
he didn't have to,

4486
01:54:24,980 --> 01:54:25,813
he was doing all these,

4487
01:54:25,860 --> 01:54:27,140
he was actually silent.

4488
01:54:27,141 --> 01:54:28,250
He was like this,

4489
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:29,760
you mean the condom or Gregg?

4490
01:54:29,770 --> 01:54:30,021
I mean,

4491
01:54:30,021 --> 01:54:30,900
they were stylish,

4492
01:54:31,100 --> 01:54:33,170
ta Nice clothes on sweets.

4493
01:54:33,171 --> 01:54:37,910
He was doing the role like commercials
and he was driving like the fryer.

4494
01:54:37,910 --> 01:54:38,170
He is,

4495
01:54:38,170 --> 01:54:39,080
and he was the head,

4496
01:54:39,081 --> 01:54:43,700
the hairstyle where you had the blonde
tips and every single girl would that

4497
01:54:43,940 --> 01:54:46,490
every single a 40,000 seat arena.

4498
01:54:46,990 --> 01:54:51,770
And I'm all dressed
dressed to pretty much,

4499
01:54:52,160 --> 01:54:52,521
and then,

4500
01:54:52,521 --> 01:54:53,060
um,

4501
01:54:53,060 --> 01:54:54,830
the little golf clubs
and there come out this,

4502
01:54:54,840 --> 01:54:57,680
the pure excitement of just
being in the same room as him.

4503
01:54:57,810 --> 01:54:58,640
Who's beautiful man?

4504
01:54:58,640 --> 01:54:58,911
He,

4505
01:54:58,911 --> 01:54:59,300
um,

4506
01:54:59,300 --> 01:54:59,960
he was,

4507
01:54:59,960 --> 01:55:01,340
he retired young too.

4508
01:55:01,430 --> 01:55:02,263
Yay.

4509
01:55:02,330 --> 01:55:03,560
And then once he retired,

4510
01:55:03,590 --> 01:55:06,920
k one collapsed probably a year
later because they get crazy.

4511
01:55:06,921 --> 01:55:09,140
They didn't have this
dire anymore without that.

4512
01:55:09,141 --> 01:55:10,220
I'm without one.

4513
01:55:10,221 --> 01:55:11,054
One fighter.

4514
01:55:11,600 --> 01:55:12,500
He was the,

4515
01:55:12,610 --> 01:55:13,790
the pinnacle he was,

4516
01:55:13,970 --> 01:55:15,230
and I wanted to fight him.

4517
01:55:15,231 --> 01:55:16,300
And then every single person,

4518
01:55:16,320 --> 01:55:17,000
the one of the fighting,

4519
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:17,550
because a,

4520
01:55:17,550 --> 01:55:18,410
if you beat him,

4521
01:55:18,740 --> 01:55:22,700
that was going to launch
it to the stratosphere of
just becoming an overnight,

4522
01:55:22,750 --> 01:55:23,583
uh,

4523
01:55:23,690 --> 01:55:24,231
phenomenon.

4524
01:55:24,231 --> 01:55:25,370
So he fought bull cow,

4525
01:55:25,371 --> 01:55:26,020
right?

4526
01:55:26,020 --> 01:55:26,500
Yes.

4527
01:55:26,500 --> 01:55:27,800
At the same year that I football here,

4528
01:55:27,860 --> 01:55:31,250
I fought by book out first
in the first fight and then,

4529
01:55:31,280 --> 01:55:31,641
um,

4530
01:55:31,641 --> 01:55:32,520
it was Masada Bork,

4531
01:55:32,530 --> 01:55:34,400
our final and then Bork.

4532
01:55:34,640 --> 01:55:35,473
How

4533
01:55:37,010 --> 01:55:38,000
should a one after three,

4534
01:55:38,001 --> 01:55:39,980
they called it a draw and the Masada,

4535
01:55:39,981 --> 01:55:40,970
his eyes closed.

4536
01:55:41,330 --> 01:55:41,980
He had a limp.

4537
01:55:41,980 --> 01:55:42,830
He is probably,

4538
01:55:42,831 --> 01:55:46,560
I think he started urinating blood the
next day and they called it an extension

4539
01:55:46,920 --> 01:55:51,230
and I draw one more around and
Massaro has looked at borecas kind of,

4540
01:55:51,280 --> 01:55:52,113
oh no,

4541
01:55:52,380 --> 01:55:53,460
this isn't going to be good.

4542
01:55:53,850 --> 01:55:54,860
So then I'm bored.

4543
01:55:54,880 --> 01:55:57,930
Cows going out there and done the business
for another three minutes and then

4544
01:55:57,960 --> 01:55:58,830
they've awarded the,

4545
01:55:58,831 --> 01:55:59,110
the,

4546
01:55:59,110 --> 01:56:00,930
the cow mex title to am book out.

4547
01:56:00,931 --> 01:56:01,764
But um,

4548
01:56:01,770 --> 01:56:02,970
then the next day you heard,

4549
01:56:03,060 --> 01:56:03,700
yeah,

4550
01:56:03,700 --> 01:56:04,050
Messiah,

4551
01:56:04,050 --> 01:56:04,980
I wasn't healthy.

4552
01:56:05,790 --> 01:56:06,630
They should have stopped it,

4553
01:56:06,680 --> 01:56:08,190
but because he was Japanese,

4554
01:56:08,191 --> 01:56:09,024
I wanted,

4555
01:56:09,110 --> 01:56:10,530
they want to give them a chance to win.

4556
01:56:10,590 --> 01:56:10,950
Yay.

4557
01:56:10,950 --> 01:56:11,783
Wow.

4558
01:56:11,970 --> 01:56:12,803
That's not good.

4559
01:56:13,100 --> 01:56:13,771
And uh,

4560
01:56:13,771 --> 01:56:14,461
kind of like Don,

4561
01:56:14,461 --> 01:56:15,990
it's interesting that he never came back,

4562
01:56:16,250 --> 01:56:16,480
but,

4563
01:56:16,480 --> 01:56:18,510
but that's how I ended
up winning the Max twice.

4564
01:56:18,570 --> 01:56:19,590
So to his credit,

4565
01:56:19,591 --> 01:56:19,891
he's,

4566
01:56:19,891 --> 01:56:20,370
um,

4567
01:56:20,370 --> 01:56:22,360
he'll be undeniably the,

4568
01:56:22,361 --> 01:56:24,310
the greatest depth cause uh,

4569
01:56:24,420 --> 01:56:25,710
in the heavyweights they had,

4570
01:56:26,890 --> 01:56:27,440
uh,

4571
01:56:27,440 --> 01:56:27,681
what,

4572
01:56:27,681 --> 01:56:28,514
what was the,

4573
01:56:28,740 --> 01:56:30,270
what was the heavyweight champions name?

4574
01:56:30,660 --> 01:56:35,520
I'm not changing the
heavyweight as Masashi Musashi.

4575
01:56:35,730 --> 01:56:36,340
Musashi.

4576
01:56:36,340 --> 01:56:36,641
Yeah.

4577
01:56:36,641 --> 01:56:37,200
Yeah.

4578
01:56:37,200 --> 01:56:41,620
And he never sort of excel to their level
where Massaro did save him from Masada

4579
01:56:41,670 --> 01:56:43,810
to when the k one twice against legit,

4580
01:56:43,930 --> 01:56:44,300
uh,

4581
01:56:44,300 --> 01:56:45,750
will kill us.

4582
01:56:46,140 --> 01:56:46,680
Um,

4583
01:56:46,680 --> 01:56:46,921
yeah,

4584
01:56:46,921 --> 01:56:47,380
he's a,

4585
01:56:47,380 --> 01:56:47,671
he went,

4586
01:56:47,671 --> 01:56:51,180
he was a real world
championship caliber and really,

4587
01:56:51,181 --> 01:56:53,820
probably the only Japanese
have fought at that level.

4588
01:56:53,850 --> 01:56:54,980
I think if it wasn't for K,

4589
01:56:55,240 --> 01:56:56,210
if it wasn't for side,

4590
01:56:56,300 --> 01:56:57,960
there would have been no k one max.

4591
01:56:58,380 --> 01:56:58,920
He was him.

4592
01:56:58,920 --> 01:57:00,530
He was the kid that shine that said,

4593
01:57:00,531 --> 01:57:00,720
yeah,

4594
01:57:00,720 --> 01:57:03,110
we need to make this 70
kilo division because I'm,

4595
01:57:03,120 --> 01:57:06,410
this kid is going to take us all
away and put us on the wall stage,

4596
01:57:06,490 --> 01:57:07,323
legitimate,

4597
01:57:07,450 --> 01:57:07,860
um,

4598
01:57:07,860 --> 01:57:08,693
as a country.

4599
01:57:09,060 --> 01:57:13,380
So it's unique in combat sports
that he decided to stay retired.

4600
01:57:13,590 --> 01:57:14,310
Yes.

4601
01:57:14,310 --> 01:57:14,940
You know,

4602
01:57:14,940 --> 01:57:18,060
I want an a wonder what that was was
just probably the punishment from some of

4603
01:57:18,061 --> 01:57:20,880
those fights just got
to a point where money,

4604
01:57:20,930 --> 01:57:21,763
the fame,

4605
01:57:21,930 --> 01:57:23,550
I think you've got to
the stage where he'd,

4606
01:57:23,551 --> 01:57:26,780
he'd already conquered
the sport and there was,

4607
01:57:26,820 --> 01:57:28,330
there was nowhere for him to go anymore.

4608
01:57:28,350 --> 01:57:31,020
He'd already done everything
and had money in the bank.

4609
01:57:31,530 --> 01:57:34,500
And then I think get the stage where
you don't want to wake up at six in the

4610
01:57:34,501 --> 01:57:35,131
morning anymore.

4611
01:57:35,131 --> 01:57:39,210
You don't want to have to put ice on your
knees and Yay and your shoulders after

4612
01:57:39,211 --> 01:57:40,044
every session.

4613
01:57:40,380 --> 01:57:40,980
Um,

4614
01:57:40,980 --> 01:57:41,910
so yeah,

4615
01:57:41,911 --> 01:57:46,110
everybody that fights
in MMA or kickboxing,

4616
01:57:46,140 --> 01:57:50,880
there's always that one person in
every sport that has that life,

4617
01:57:50,881 --> 01:57:53,670
whether it's Ronda Rousey in women's MMA,

4618
01:57:54,060 --> 01:57:54,391
you know,

4619
01:57:54,391 --> 01:57:56,190
and then the other girls
are looking at her and they,

4620
01:57:56,191 --> 01:57:56,521
you know,

4621
01:57:56,521 --> 01:57:56,731
they're,

4622
01:57:56,731 --> 01:58:00,780
they're struggling or whether it's
Masato or whether it's Conor McGregor.

4623
01:58:00,780 --> 01:58:02,550
There's like this one person.

4624
01:58:02,650 --> 01:58:02,950
Yes.

4625
01:58:02,950 --> 01:58:03,470
One is,

4626
01:58:03,470 --> 01:58:04,740
these are a few outliers.

4627
01:58:04,741 --> 01:58:05,850
It sort of figure it out.

4628
01:58:06,180 --> 01:58:08,280
And then Holly Holmes
even coming out and said,

4629
01:58:08,281 --> 01:58:08,580
um,

4630
01:58:08,580 --> 01:58:10,080
I want what Rhonda has.

4631
01:58:10,730 --> 01:58:12,000
I wanted what Massada had.

4632
01:58:12,030 --> 01:58:12,863
Oh,

4633
01:58:12,900 --> 01:58:13,770
I would love the,

4634
01:58:13,810 --> 01:58:17,150
to robbery doing the pull.

4635
01:58:17,250 --> 01:58:18,240
I remember one commercial,

4636
01:58:18,241 --> 01:58:18,901
he's in a Fri,

4637
01:58:18,901 --> 01:58:19,470
he pulls up,

4638
01:58:19,470 --> 01:58:21,080
you see that pull up in the door.

4639
01:58:21,081 --> 01:58:22,530
I've been like a space ship.

4640
01:58:22,531 --> 01:58:24,960
And then they're focusing on his
role at the watch and it's like,

4641
01:58:25,400 --> 01:58:28,110
and he's in a suit and he's
looking stylish and he's got it.

4642
01:58:28,111 --> 01:58:28,471
Yeah.

4643
01:58:28,471 --> 01:58:28,910
He's got,

4644
01:58:28,910 --> 01:58:29,700
uh,

4645
01:58:29,700 --> 01:58:30,001
just,

4646
01:58:30,001 --> 01:58:30,770
just the king.

4647
01:58:30,770 --> 01:58:31,830
It's like a look at this guy.

4648
01:58:31,860 --> 01:58:32,700
This is what a,

4649
01:58:32,710 --> 01:58:33,543
what a hero.

4650
01:58:34,020 --> 01:58:34,620
Sorry.

4651
01:58:34,620 --> 01:58:36,960
And as a cause you're get
by playing the same game.

4652
01:58:36,961 --> 01:58:37,201
It's like,

4653
01:58:37,201 --> 01:58:38,250
how come I can't be him?

4654
01:58:38,280 --> 01:58:39,001
I'd love to be him.

4655
01:58:39,001 --> 01:58:39,900
That'd be so cool.

4656
01:58:40,620 --> 01:58:42,370
Did the guys and k one

4657
01:58:42,430 --> 01:58:44,080
the heavyweight division k one,

4658
01:58:44,410 --> 01:58:45,000
um,

4659
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:46,600
did there those guys make good money?

4660
01:58:46,750 --> 01:58:47,440
Uh,

4661
01:58:47,440 --> 01:58:52,120
well they'd had a eight men tournament
once a year and when it was at its peak,

4662
01:58:52,180 --> 01:58:53,800
they had the Tokyo Dome,

4663
01:58:53,830 --> 01:58:55,230
90,000 people in it.

4664
01:58:55,290 --> 01:58:56,920
It would sell it in two hours.

4665
01:58:57,250 --> 01:58:57,450
Uh,

4666
01:58:57,450 --> 01:58:57,970
and,

4667
01:58:57,970 --> 01:59:00,190
and then you'd have to
fight three times in,

4668
01:59:00,240 --> 01:59:04,930
in approximately three hours in
the grand prize was a 500,000 us.

4669
01:59:05,410 --> 01:59:10,410
So do you know how much
profit they must've made of
you have 90,000 people in an

4670
01:59:11,471 --> 01:59:13,570
arena and you're selling those,

4671
01:59:13,571 --> 01:59:13,781
you know,

4672
01:59:13,781 --> 01:59:14,614
just think about it.

4673
01:59:14,650 --> 01:59:16,060
Even if it's only 10 bucks.

4674
01:59:16,150 --> 01:59:16,540
Yeah.

4675
01:59:16,540 --> 01:59:21,540
That is a fuck load of money and that is
a goddamn fuck load of money and you're

4676
01:59:21,791 --> 01:59:24,190
only paying out 500
grand to the winter end.

4677
01:59:24,340 --> 01:59:28,510
You have paper view and miss the issue
might have forgot to pay tax or for a few

4678
01:59:28,510 --> 01:59:29,343
years in a row.

4679
01:59:29,890 --> 01:59:30,940
Then he had to do,

4680
01:59:31,030 --> 01:59:33,070
I think he believed he
had to do a little bit of,

4681
01:59:33,071 --> 01:59:33,700
um,

4682
01:59:33,700 --> 01:59:34,300
time.

4683
01:59:34,300 --> 01:59:35,100
Uh,

4684
01:59:35,100 --> 01:59:35,390
Nah,

4685
01:59:35,390 --> 01:59:36,223
he got,

4686
01:59:36,450 --> 01:59:37,600
we stay at home,

4687
01:59:37,690 --> 01:59:38,051
home,

4688
01:59:38,051 --> 01:59:38,860
home detention.

4689
01:59:38,860 --> 01:59:39,400
That's it.

4690
01:59:39,400 --> 01:59:40,930
They home attention for a few years.

4691
01:59:40,960 --> 01:59:41,111
Oh,

4692
01:59:41,111 --> 01:59:41,621
that's great.

4693
01:59:41,621 --> 01:59:42,454
And that's when

4694
01:59:44,950 --> 01:59:46,150
it's better than jail man.

4695
01:59:46,500 --> 01:59:47,170
Uh,

4696
01:59:47,170 --> 01:59:47,891
but yeah,

4697
01:59:47,891 --> 01:59:48,221
and then,

4698
01:59:48,221 --> 01:59:49,054
uh,

4699
01:59:49,160 --> 01:59:49,400
uh,

4700
01:59:49,400 --> 01:59:51,310
the other gentleman took care
of the k one and that's when,

4701
01:59:51,340 --> 01:59:52,780
that's when the size
shows that it happened.

4702
01:59:52,781 --> 01:59:54,550
That's when the Bob Sapp
started coming along.

4703
01:59:54,640 --> 01:59:55,810
Main choice that are coming in.

4704
01:59:55,880 --> 01:59:56,120
Oh,

4705
01:59:56,120 --> 01:59:56,861
is that what happened?

4706
01:59:56,861 --> 01:59:57,694
That's when

4707
01:59:58,940 --> 02:00:03,670
she had this platform where everything
was 90,000 people and then everything was

4708
02:00:03,671 --> 02:00:04,151
perfect.

4709
02:00:04,151 --> 02:00:04,511
And then,

4710
02:00:04,511 --> 02:00:05,344
um,

4711
02:00:05,390 --> 02:00:09,910
gay and then a sort of sat a declining
from that moment on as too bad because in

4712
02:00:09,911 --> 02:00:11,410
the glory days of k one,

4713
02:00:11,411 --> 02:00:11,890
you know,

4714
02:00:11,890 --> 02:00:15,370
back in the Ernesto who stays Peter Arts,

4715
02:00:15,940 --> 02:00:16,481
God,

4716
02:00:16,481 --> 02:00:17,980
Mike Bernardo is like,

4717
02:00:18,270 --> 02:00:20,080
those fights were so technical,

4718
02:00:20,081 --> 02:00:20,950
so high level,

4719
02:00:20,951 --> 02:00:21,784
so great.

4720
02:00:21,790 --> 02:00:23,050
Jerome Le Banner,

4721
02:00:23,051 --> 02:00:23,590
I mean those,

4722
02:00:23,590 --> 02:00:23,851
all,

4723
02:00:23,851 --> 02:00:24,550
my God,

4724
02:00:24,550 --> 02:00:25,610
we had same Greco,

4725
02:00:25,690 --> 02:00:26,050
eh,

4726
02:00:26,050 --> 02:00:27,200
that was fighting for Australia.

4727
02:00:27,730 --> 02:00:29,170
He was the Australian hero.

4728
02:00:29,800 --> 02:00:30,131
And then,

4729
02:00:30,131 --> 02:00:30,940
uh,

4730
02:00:30,940 --> 02:00:31,361
yeah,

4731
02:00:31,361 --> 02:00:33,580
it was semi Schiltz and Oh,

4732
02:00:33,581 --> 02:00:33,850
before,

4733
02:00:33,850 --> 02:00:34,780
this is before the shoot.

4734
02:00:34,781 --> 02:00:37,110
And it was before the golden era,

4735
02:00:37,130 --> 02:00:38,050
Larry Smith.

4736
02:00:38,110 --> 02:00:38,650
Um,

4737
02:00:38,650 --> 02:00:41,230
and it just seemed to be those eight
guys that were just keep knocking each

4738
02:00:41,231 --> 02:00:44,530
other out a year after year after
year for about 10 years in a row.

4739
02:00:44,620 --> 02:00:46,630
And as a teenager there was,

4740
02:00:46,690 --> 02:00:47,590
there was just the,

4741
02:00:47,810 --> 02:00:52,100
some of them would get a VHS of the latest
Graham pricks and then you sit there

4742
02:00:52,101 --> 02:00:53,050
and watch it and then we,

4743
02:00:53,051 --> 02:00:53,884
so uh,

4744
02:00:54,010 --> 02:00:54,341
yeah,

4745
02:00:54,341 --> 02:00:55,070
you could've moved.

4746
02:00:55,070 --> 02:00:55,240
You'd,

4747
02:00:55,240 --> 02:00:55,461
yeah.

4748
02:00:55,461 --> 02:00:59,170
All the boys are sitting around with the
popcorn member Andy Hook and the hook

4749
02:00:59,171 --> 02:01:00,640
was an undersized guy.

4750
02:01:01,090 --> 02:01:01,780
Andy Hug.

4751
02:01:01,780 --> 02:01:02,650
Remember those days?

4752
02:01:02,680 --> 02:01:02,910
Yeah.

4753
02:01:02,910 --> 02:01:03,401
The Spinning,

4754
02:01:03,401 --> 02:01:05,170
the spinning heel kicks to the thighs.

4755
02:01:05,171 --> 02:01:05,501
Yeah.

4756
02:01:05,501 --> 02:01:07,000
We'll kick to the thigh.

4757
02:01:07,030 --> 02:01:07,750
Yes.

4758
02:01:07,750 --> 02:01:08,790
Nobody was doing that.

4759
02:01:08,800 --> 02:01:09,730
You know who is doing that?

4760
02:01:10,510 --> 02:01:10,631
Well,

4761
02:01:10,631 --> 02:01:11,530
he was a killer cushion.

4762
02:01:11,531 --> 02:01:11,940
Right.

4763
02:01:11,940 --> 02:01:12,520
Here's corrugation.

4764
02:01:12,520 --> 02:01:13,100
Yes.

4765
02:01:13,100 --> 02:01:15,910
Same as same Greco and a
lot of wild kids send me,

4766
02:01:15,911 --> 02:01:16,840
she'll send me,

4767
02:01:16,841 --> 02:01:17,890
she sent me,

4768
02:01:17,891 --> 02:01:18,420
she'll,

4769
02:01:18,420 --> 02:01:22,000
it'll be the same recur Andy Hug
and they all had that coalition.

4770
02:01:22,050 --> 02:01:22,870
Um,

4771
02:01:22,870 --> 02:01:23,111
yeah,

4772
02:01:23,111 --> 02:01:25,480
just that mentality of
walk forward through leaks.

4773
02:01:25,510 --> 02:01:27,190
But Andy Hook was only like five,

4774
02:01:27,191 --> 02:01:28,240
10 or something like that.

4775
02:01:28,241 --> 02:01:28,391
Right.

4776
02:01:28,391 --> 02:01:32,020
It wasn't a big guy and he had to put on
a lot of muscle in order to fight those

4777
02:01:32,021 --> 02:01:32,854
heavyweights.

4778
02:01:33,460 --> 02:01:34,670
Very undersized.

4779
02:01:34,690 --> 02:01:35,523
But you see him fight?

4780
02:01:35,710 --> 02:01:36,380
Yes.

4781
02:01:36,380 --> 02:01:38,920
A lot of those guys in
that division and um,

4782
02:01:38,960 --> 02:01:39,410
it would,

4783
02:01:39,410 --> 02:01:39,681
yeah.

4784
02:01:39,681 --> 02:01:40,010
Today

4785
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:43,070
or knock you out and then a month later
I would knock them out and then it was

4786
02:01:43,071 --> 02:01:44,720
just crazy that they fought like that.

4787
02:01:45,110 --> 02:01:45,670
Yeah.

4788
02:01:45,670 --> 02:01:46,910
Everyone would fight each other six,

4789
02:01:46,911 --> 02:01:47,181
seven,

4790
02:01:47,181 --> 02:01:48,800
eight times and it'd be a 50,

4791
02:01:48,801 --> 02:01:49,461
50 split.

4792
02:01:49,461 --> 02:01:50,000
You know,

4793
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:53,330
who was ever on that day was going to win
and whoever didn't get knocked out and

4794
02:01:53,331 --> 02:01:58,331
training whoever who got knocked out like
the furthest amount of time from that

4795
02:01:58,551 --> 02:01:59,150
tournament.

4796
02:01:59,150 --> 02:01:59,480
Yes.

4797
02:01:59,480 --> 02:02:01,790
Because those guys were
just destroying their chins.

4798
02:02:01,820 --> 02:02:02,121
Yes.

4799
02:02:02,121 --> 02:02:02,750
Yes.

4800
02:02:02,750 --> 02:02:03,590
If you think about it,

4801
02:02:03,591 --> 02:02:04,040
I mean,

4802
02:02:04,040 --> 02:02:06,500
how could you get knocked out and they
get knocked out again a month later.

4803
02:02:06,530 --> 02:02:07,400
That's fucking crazy.

4804
02:02:07,620 --> 02:02:11,090
The mock Hunt's back
when he was a human race,

4805
02:02:11,091 --> 02:02:14,060
if was standing tonitto
dropping their hands,

4806
02:02:14,061 --> 02:02:14,840
let needs taking,

4807
02:02:14,840 --> 02:02:18,590
taking pot shots at each other's Chin
and just standing there and smiling and

4808
02:02:18,591 --> 02:02:19,490
then another rally.

4809
02:02:19,491 --> 02:02:20,031
It was a,

4810
02:02:20,031 --> 02:02:20,421
yeah,

4811
02:02:20,421 --> 02:02:23,930
that's the sort of stuff that had made
a legends and that was when Mirko Mirko

4812
02:02:23,930 --> 02:02:26,390
Cro cop start first start fighting
came when he was so skinny.

4813
02:02:26,720 --> 02:02:27,553
Yes,

4814
02:02:27,960 --> 02:02:28,190
yes,

4815
02:02:28,190 --> 02:02:28,431
yes,

4816
02:02:28,431 --> 02:02:28,900
yes.

4817
02:02:28,900 --> 02:02:29,181
There was,

4818
02:02:29,181 --> 02:02:31,460
I guess he wasn't lifting
weights or anything back then,

4819
02:02:31,461 --> 02:02:31,850
maybe,

4820
02:02:31,850 --> 02:02:33,560
or just wasn't as much or,

4821
02:02:33,740 --> 02:02:35,180
and then he had to put on weight as well.

4822
02:02:35,310 --> 02:02:37,220
[inaudible]

4823
02:02:37,340 --> 02:02:40,820
was always the bridesmaid
always doing the business.

4824
02:02:40,821 --> 02:02:42,230
And then when it always came to the,

4825
02:02:42,231 --> 02:02:42,821
the eight man,

4826
02:02:42,821 --> 02:02:46,160
he'd never quite successfully
in the toes get close.

4827
02:02:46,460 --> 02:02:47,151
You remember when he,

4828
02:02:47,151 --> 02:02:47,510
uh,

4829
02:02:47,510 --> 02:02:48,050
he fought,

4830
02:02:48,050 --> 02:02:49,250
he almost won,

4831
02:02:49,251 --> 02:02:51,110
but he broke his arm against hoost.

4832
02:02:51,230 --> 02:02:52,010
Ooh.

4833
02:02:52,010 --> 02:02:54,080
Shattered is a shattered his form.

4834
02:02:54,110 --> 02:02:55,460
You'll fuck,

4835
02:02:55,461 --> 02:02:55,850
man.

4836
02:02:55,850 --> 02:02:56,930
Those were some amazing,

4837
02:02:56,931 --> 02:02:57,520
amazing fights.

4838
02:02:57,520 --> 02:02:58,190
And again,

4839
02:02:58,190 --> 02:03:01,730
that's something that a lot of
Americans just never experienced this.

4840
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:04,940
It didn't air over here
before the UFC era came.

4841
02:03:04,941 --> 02:03:06,500
That was the pinnacle.

4842
02:03:06,501 --> 02:03:08,900
That was the combat
that was combat sports.

4843
02:03:09,320 --> 02:03:12,590
Pretty much it was before the
UFC because it was before pride.

4844
02:03:12,860 --> 02:03:14,150
It was before the UFC.

4845
02:03:14,330 --> 02:03:18,710
That was the big martial arts
event was the k one Grand Prix.

4846
02:03:18,740 --> 02:03:19,190
Yes.

4847
02:03:19,190 --> 02:03:19,471
When you,

4848
02:03:19,471 --> 02:03:23,930
when you get that big trophy in the
fucking confetti in the sky and the giant

4849
02:03:23,990 --> 02:03:24,823
check,

4850
02:03:25,060 --> 02:03:26,090
you know what I mean with that shit.

4851
02:03:26,600 --> 02:03:27,860
I'm a giant checks.

4852
02:03:27,890 --> 02:03:28,281
Yes.

4853
02:03:28,281 --> 02:03:29,300
Where the giant checks go.

4854
02:03:29,330 --> 02:03:30,110
I've got a giant check.

4855
02:03:30,110 --> 02:03:31,970
I would like to see a
giant check come back.

4856
02:03:32,020 --> 02:03:32,241
I'll go,

4857
02:03:32,241 --> 02:03:34,280
I'll go to a million but joint and chick.

4858
02:03:34,430 --> 02:03:35,241
Oh Wow.

4859
02:03:35,241 --> 02:03:37,520
My Gym when I'm quite
proud of from Thailand,

4860
02:03:37,521 --> 02:03:40,280
from Thailand and say wow that looks good.

4861
02:03:40,310 --> 02:03:40,581
Yeah.

4862
02:03:40,581 --> 02:03:41,110
It looks close.

4863
02:03:41,110 --> 02:03:41,451
Zero.

4864
02:03:41,451 --> 02:03:42,840
Someone says how much does it not?

4865
02:03:42,860 --> 02:03:43,420
They're not dead,

4866
02:03:43,420 --> 02:03:44,253
but that doesn't matter.

4867
02:03:44,730 --> 02:03:46,660
It's not zero

4868
02:03:48,190 --> 02:03:52,280
and its entire so you're missing
the point on it's not about money.

4869
02:03:52,730 --> 02:03:54,020
It's about giant checks.

4870
02:03:54,130 --> 02:03:54,860
Yes.

4871
02:03:54,860 --> 02:03:55,581
The back in the,

4872
02:03:55,581 --> 02:03:56,570
yeah Kaylen was cool.

4873
02:03:56,600 --> 02:03:57,433
It's a,

4874
02:03:57,440 --> 02:04:01,910
but you think of k one the only
paying out 500 grand to the winner.

4875
02:04:01,940 --> 02:04:02,360
Yes.

4876
02:04:02,360 --> 02:04:03,260
Fuck man.

4877
02:04:03,650 --> 02:04:04,580
That's a lot of money.

4878
02:04:04,581 --> 02:04:09,170
They're making it 90,000 seats so I dunno.

4879
02:04:09,320 --> 02:04:14,320
I Dunno if 90,000 times 10 is
that nine million ninety million?

4880
02:04:15,170 --> 02:04:15,800
No,

4881
02:04:15,800 --> 02:04:15,971
no,

4882
02:04:15,971 --> 02:04:16,090
no,

4883
02:04:16,090 --> 02:04:16,923
no.

4884
02:04:17,420 --> 02:04:17,751
Oh,

4885
02:04:17,751 --> 02:04:18,440
right.

4886
02:04:18,440 --> 02:04:18,890
Okay.

4887
02:04:18,890 --> 02:04:21,320
So it's more than 10 for the gate though.

4888
02:04:21,321 --> 02:04:22,160
Like what's the gate?

4889
02:04:22,530 --> 02:04:22,910
It's usually,

4890
02:04:22,910 --> 02:04:23,630
I don't know,

4891
02:04:23,630 --> 02:04:26,930
2030 40 bucks a ticket plus concessions
and parking and all that extra.

4892
02:04:26,931 --> 02:04:27,100
Right.

4893
02:04:27,100 --> 02:04:32,100
So 90,000 times 10 is only 900,000 but
it's way more than 10 bucks a ticket.

4894
02:04:32,691 --> 02:04:32,991
Right?

4895
02:04:32,991 --> 02:04:33,171
Yeah.

4896
02:04:33,171 --> 02:04:34,004
Your boy,

4897
02:04:35,120 --> 02:04:36,860
which is a $9 million gate,

4898
02:04:37,140 --> 02:04:38,010
but then ring size,

4899
02:04:38,011 --> 02:04:39,570
probably way more than a hundred bucks.

4900
02:04:39,780 --> 02:04:40,230
Like ring,

4901
02:04:40,230 --> 02:04:43,350
ring side of the UFC could
be as much as like 500 bucks,

4902
02:04:43,351 --> 02:04:44,101
maybe even more.

4903
02:04:44,101 --> 02:04:44,490
Right?

4904
02:04:44,490 --> 02:04:45,240
Oh for sure.

4905
02:04:45,240 --> 02:04:46,440
Like a big boxing match.

4906
02:04:46,441 --> 02:04:46,950
I know that,

4907
02:04:46,950 --> 02:04:47,221
well,

4908
02:04:47,221 --> 02:04:48,840
a lot of his like scalpers too,

4909
02:04:48,841 --> 02:04:48,991
right?

4910
02:04:48,991 --> 02:04:49,824
You never know.

4911
02:04:49,830 --> 02:04:53,410
Mgm I paid to which a joyous
babe Bavis Hendrickson.

4912
02:04:53,411 --> 02:04:54,920
I paid $500 and I was,

4913
02:04:54,960 --> 02:04:55,161
oh,

4914
02:04:55,161 --> 02:04:56,250
is that in the bleaches?

4915
02:04:56,670 --> 02:04:57,010
My,

4916
02:04:57,010 --> 02:04:59,130
my mind knows actually bled.

4917
02:04:59,200 --> 02:05:00,420
That's how high up I was.

4918
02:05:00,690 --> 02:05:01,890
Who knows actually blood.

4919
02:05:01,891 --> 02:05:02,340
Yeah,

4920
02:05:02,340 --> 02:05:05,460
I have a feeling that was because you
probably got punched in that fairly

4921
02:05:05,461 --> 02:05:06,180
recently.

4922
02:05:06,180 --> 02:05:06,481
I bet.

4923
02:05:06,481 --> 02:05:07,620
If my nose is up there,

4924
02:05:07,621 --> 02:05:08,370
it wouldn't have black.

4925
02:05:08,370 --> 02:05:09,990
The oxygen levels are so low.

4926
02:05:09,991 --> 02:05:10,640
That A,

4927
02:05:10,640 --> 02:05:11,580
is that a getting dizzy?

4928
02:05:12,720 --> 02:05:13,620
That's ridiculous.

4929
02:05:16,010 --> 02:05:17,880
Who the fuck gets a nose
bleed on a mountain?

4930
02:05:17,881 --> 02:05:18,714
Is it shit real?

4931
02:05:18,750 --> 02:05:20,280
You get nose bleeds when
you go to a mountain.

4932
02:05:20,450 --> 02:05:21,240
Uh,

4933
02:05:21,240 --> 02:05:21,990
I'll get nosebleeds.

4934
02:05:21,990 --> 02:05:24,220
You get a nosebleed on a plane and I,

4935
02:05:24,640 --> 02:05:25,473
well it's

4936
02:05:26,610 --> 02:05:27,770
pressure cabin.

4937
02:05:27,900 --> 02:05:28,330
Right?

4938
02:05:28,330 --> 02:05:29,163
That makes sense.

4939
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:33,530
But I never heard of anybody getting a
nose bleed in the nose when you jumped

4940
02:05:33,531 --> 02:05:33,961
out of a plane.

4941
02:05:33,961 --> 02:05:34,794
He didn't get nose bleeds.

4942
02:05:34,890 --> 02:05:35,460
Really?

4943
02:05:35,460 --> 02:05:36,080
When you pass your,

4944
02:05:36,080 --> 02:05:36,913
maybe you bro.

4945
02:05:37,780 --> 02:05:38,613
I'll me bro.

4946
02:05:40,170 --> 02:05:41,580
Well you didn't know me then man.

4947
02:05:41,581 --> 02:05:43,020
I would have hooked you
up with better seats.

4948
02:05:43,410 --> 02:05:44,340
That's ridiculous.

4949
02:05:44,380 --> 02:05:45,690
It's such an important fight.

4950
02:05:45,691 --> 02:05:46,524
You want to be close.

4951
02:05:46,890 --> 02:05:49,130
I think I told you last
time the lady bought me my,

4952
02:05:49,140 --> 02:05:52,590
my ticket for free to go and be part of
the cause I wasn't going to go at all.

4953
02:05:52,620 --> 02:05:54,040
And then the lady bought my ticket,

4954
02:05:54,650 --> 02:05:56,060
but then I bought the ticket there.

4955
02:05:56,060 --> 02:05:56,900
Watch the fight say is.

4956
02:05:57,010 --> 02:05:57,470
Yeah.

4957
02:05:57,470 --> 02:05:57,990
But anyway,

4958
02:05:57,990 --> 02:05:58,321
anyway,

4959
02:05:58,321 --> 02:05:58,591
it was,

4960
02:05:58,591 --> 02:05:59,160
um,

4961
02:05:59,160 --> 02:06:03,750
fights are so interesting live because
you get this energy from being there in

4962
02:06:03,751 --> 02:06:06,840
that arena that you can't
reproduce it watching it at home.

4963
02:06:06,841 --> 02:06:09,030
And I don't think people
that see it at home,

4964
02:06:09,031 --> 02:06:12,420
we'll ever truly know what
it's like to see a live fight.

4965
02:06:12,421 --> 02:06:14,970
Because also there's
something that gets like,

4966
02:06:14,971 --> 02:06:16,920
I remember the first time I
went to see a boxing match,

4967
02:06:17,040 --> 02:06:18,030
I remember thinking like,

4968
02:06:18,090 --> 02:06:18,301
Oh,

4969
02:06:18,301 --> 02:06:19,230
there's no commentary.

4970
02:06:19,231 --> 02:06:20,064
This is weird.

4971
02:06:20,250 --> 02:06:24,390
Like there's something that sterilizes
it a little bit about hearing Jim Lampley

4972
02:06:24,391 --> 02:06:25,170
here,

4973
02:06:25,170 --> 02:06:28,590
ABC wide world of sports or whatever the
fuck it was back in the day when I was

4974
02:06:28,920 --> 02:06:29,880
watching boxing.

4975
02:06:30,060 --> 02:06:31,860
And then to go see a boxing match live,

4976
02:06:31,861 --> 02:06:32,101
you're like,

4977
02:06:32,101 --> 02:06:32,230
well,

4978
02:06:32,230 --> 02:06:33,240
there's no one talking.

4979
02:06:33,600 --> 02:06:33,871
You know,

4980
02:06:33,871 --> 02:06:34,900
you just hearing thump,

4981
02:06:34,960 --> 02:06:35,230
thump,

4982
02:06:35,230 --> 02:06:35,490
thump,

4983
02:06:35,490 --> 02:06:36,120
thump,

4984
02:06:36,120 --> 02:06:36,631
Bang.

4985
02:06:36,631 --> 02:06:36,841
You know,

4986
02:06:36,841 --> 02:06:39,090
you've seen someone like I
was there when Mickey Bork,

4987
02:06:39,480 --> 02:06:39,870
um,

4988
02:06:39,870 --> 02:06:40,703
Mickey Rourke,

4989
02:06:40,770 --> 02:06:41,341
Mickey work,

4990
02:06:41,341 --> 02:06:44,010
Micky Ward rather confusing people.

4991
02:06:44,280 --> 02:06:46,710
Mickey a ward was coming up in Lowell,

4992
02:06:46,711 --> 02:06:49,500
Massachusetts before we
ever had those crazy fights.

4993
02:06:49,501 --> 02:06:50,500
A series of fights with a turtle.

4994
02:06:50,501 --> 02:06:50,941
Got It.

4995
02:06:50,941 --> 02:06:51,750
Yep.

4996
02:06:51,750 --> 02:06:55,830
I saw him fight when he was a real young
professional and we saw him fight a in

4997
02:06:55,831 --> 02:06:56,400
Lowell,

4998
02:06:56,400 --> 02:06:59,310
me and my buddy Jimmy lawless
and went to see him fight live.

4999
02:06:59,880 --> 02:07:01,980
It was just like being there in,

5000
02:07:02,010 --> 02:07:04,440
in a small arena who,

5001
02:07:04,441 --> 02:07:04,651
you know,

5002
02:07:04,651 --> 02:07:09,651
with a local hometown guy and see a
local boxing match and hear the slap of

5003
02:07:09,781 --> 02:07:11,850
leather on faces and bodies.

5004
02:07:11,851 --> 02:07:15,120
It's a such a different experience
than watching it on television,

5005
02:07:15,121 --> 02:07:16,410
which is like so much more.

5006
02:07:16,411 --> 02:07:17,244
Um,

5007
02:07:17,250 --> 02:07:19,530
it seems like it's not really happening,

5008
02:07:19,750 --> 02:07:20,640
even if it's happening,

5009
02:07:20,641 --> 02:07:21,660
even if it's brutal,

5010
02:07:21,750 --> 02:07:22,680
you're not there,

5011
02:07:22,860 --> 02:07:23,480
you know?

5012
02:07:23,480 --> 02:07:24,070
Um,

5013
02:07:24,070 --> 02:07:28,080
same with that liquid promotion that I'm
doing now with my wife and I live with

5014
02:07:28,081 --> 02:07:28,790
the CMT.

5015
02:07:28,790 --> 02:07:29,300
You've,

5016
02:07:29,300 --> 02:07:30,330
you're feeling empty,

5017
02:07:30,331 --> 02:07:31,610
meaning cage more time.

5018
02:07:31,900 --> 02:07:32,220
Say,

5019
02:07:32,220 --> 02:07:34,260
say you feel,

5020
02:07:34,310 --> 02:07:36,060
you feel why in

5021
02:07:36,060 --> 02:07:36,880
the in the room.

5022
02:07:36,880 --> 02:07:37,650
Yeah.

5023
02:07:37,650 --> 02:07:38,920
It not only watching it,

5024
02:07:38,921 --> 02:07:39,630
but um,

5025
02:07:39,630 --> 02:07:41,670
you punching as someone's getting hit Ya,

5026
02:07:41,690 --> 02:07:42,460
Ya.

5027
02:07:42,460 --> 02:07:43,220
Yeah.

5028
02:07:43,220 --> 02:07:43,830
Um,

5029
02:07:43,830 --> 02:07:44,690
here's wrapping the,

5030
02:07:44,760 --> 02:07:46,180
and your body and backing your neck.

5031
02:07:46,380 --> 02:07:46,600
Yeah,

5032
02:07:46,600 --> 02:07:47,590
you got goosebumps.

5033
02:07:47,800 --> 02:07:51,610
You can't not look away from the cage
because at any given second someone's

5034
02:07:51,611 --> 02:07:52,444
going to get knocked out.

5035
02:07:52,530 --> 02:07:52,930
So,

5036
02:07:52,930 --> 02:07:54,460
but you don't have that
when you're watching on TV.

5037
02:07:54,461 --> 02:07:55,271
You're looking at your phone,

5038
02:07:55,271 --> 02:07:55,781
you're looking up,

5039
02:07:55,781 --> 02:07:56,441
you're looking down.

5040
02:07:56,441 --> 02:07:57,940
But why are they alive?

5041
02:07:58,330 --> 02:07:59,050
Um,

5042
02:07:59,050 --> 02:07:59,291
yeah.

5043
02:07:59,291 --> 02:08:01,080
You can feel the atmosphere.

5044
02:08:01,110 --> 02:08:04,610
You can smell it and you can
smell the toil you can use.

5045
02:08:04,611 --> 02:08:04,881
Yeah.

5046
02:08:04,881 --> 02:08:05,290
It's just,

5047
02:08:05,290 --> 02:08:06,640
it's a different beast than when you're,

5048
02:08:06,641 --> 02:08:07,130
um,

5049
02:08:07,130 --> 02:08:07,410
when,

5050
02:08:07,410 --> 02:08:12,140
when you present the tight
oil or the lineament yeah.

5051
02:08:12,220 --> 02:08:13,090
What does that should do?

5052
02:08:13,300 --> 02:08:14,200
Shouldn't do anything.

5053
02:08:14,230 --> 02:08:14,501
Yeah.

5054
02:08:14,501 --> 02:08:15,070
It warms you up.

5055
02:08:15,070 --> 02:08:15,910
It's nice and warm.

5056
02:08:15,911 --> 02:08:16,031
So,

5057
02:08:16,031 --> 02:08:16,210
yeah.

5058
02:08:16,210 --> 02:08:19,110
Your measures in the skin so that you're
nice and loose and when you're shadow

5059
02:08:19,120 --> 02:08:19,571
boxing,

5060
02:08:19,571 --> 02:08:19,721
you're,

5061
02:08:19,721 --> 02:08:20,770
your body's on fire.

5062
02:08:20,770 --> 02:08:22,210
So you feel a,

5063
02:08:22,230 --> 02:08:24,250
instead of skipping for 10 minutes,

5064
02:08:24,251 --> 02:08:26,680
you put the tile and you rub it
in and then you're already warm.

5065
02:08:27,100 --> 02:08:28,570
My friend has a doctor told me,

5066
02:08:28,571 --> 02:08:29,171
listen man,

5067
02:08:29,171 --> 02:08:30,280
if that shit did anything,

5068
02:08:30,281 --> 02:08:32,680
it would get into your muscles
itself and you'd be poisoned.

5069
02:08:32,970 --> 02:08:33,430
Really?

5070
02:08:33,430 --> 02:08:33,731
I go,

5071
02:08:33,731 --> 02:08:34,031
really?

5072
02:08:34,031 --> 02:08:34,271
He goes,

5073
02:08:34,271 --> 02:08:34,481
yeah.

5074
02:08:34,481 --> 02:08:36,520
It's called a topical
analgesic and heat up.

5075
02:08:36,521 --> 02:08:37,780
Your skin doesn't do a damn thing.

5076
02:08:37,800 --> 02:08:38,000
Yeah.

5077
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:38,833
If you really,

5078
02:08:39,150 --> 02:08:39,561
if you,

5079
02:08:39,561 --> 02:08:41,380
if you've got a light sweat
and you put that stuff on,

5080
02:08:41,980 --> 02:08:44,370
you want a urine fire it,

5081
02:08:44,430 --> 02:08:46,190
you're going to try and
put yourself under a hose.

5082
02:08:47,140 --> 02:08:47,930
Let me ask you this,

5083
02:08:47,930 --> 02:08:48,950
if that's the case,

5084
02:08:49,130 --> 02:08:52,430
how can you put that stuff on your skin
and then you're clenching and if you're

5085
02:08:52,431 --> 02:08:52,881
clenching,

5086
02:08:52,881 --> 02:08:54,260
that stuff can get in someone's eyes.

5087
02:08:54,261 --> 02:08:55,094
No,

5088
02:08:55,990 --> 02:08:56,823
maybe

5089
02:08:58,630 --> 02:08:59,470
it does,

5090
02:08:59,950 --> 02:09:02,410
but you massage it in 15
minutes before you walked.

5091
02:09:02,420 --> 02:09:02,660
Right?

5092
02:09:02,660 --> 02:09:05,960
So if you're grabbing and
you're fighting for the plum,

5093
02:09:06,030 --> 02:09:06,300
yeah,

5094
02:09:06,300 --> 02:09:06,541
right.

5095
02:09:06,541 --> 02:09:10,200
And you've got that shit on your forearms
and it's got a turning away and it

5096
02:09:10,201 --> 02:09:12,030
gets in his eyes is that happened to you?

5097
02:09:12,210 --> 02:09:13,850
But at the time you
get onto the ring gear,

5098
02:09:14,380 --> 02:09:15,213
it's absorbed.

5099
02:09:15,260 --> 02:09:17,340
So in all that,

5100
02:09:17,840 --> 02:09:19,380
that's why he can't use it in the UFC.

5101
02:09:19,381 --> 02:09:20,370
UFC in the early days,

5102
02:09:20,371 --> 02:09:20,611
man,

5103
02:09:20,611 --> 02:09:20,881
Dude's,

5104
02:09:20,881 --> 02:09:25,590
which is goals and we can
put Vaseline 11 I buddies,

5105
02:09:25,600 --> 02:09:26,370
well between the,

5106
02:09:26,370 --> 02:09:28,470
the limit and the Vaseline all over say,

5107
02:09:28,471 --> 02:09:28,651
yeah,

5108
02:09:28,651 --> 02:09:29,481
you're come out and yeah,

5109
02:09:29,481 --> 02:09:31,620
and you're shining and
you're glossy and yeah,

5110
02:09:32,380 --> 02:09:34,540
we catch in the kicks and
can pull out of the catches.

5111
02:09:34,541 --> 02:09:38,310
And the only thing is if you're
the last fight of the night,

5112
02:09:38,311 --> 02:09:42,090
say if you teach someone in the stomach
and then you put your foot on the canvas

5113
02:09:42,390 --> 02:09:44,310
and then if you get oil all the time,

5114
02:09:44,320 --> 02:09:44,530
you know,

5115
02:09:44,530 --> 02:09:45,301
the last fight,

5116
02:09:45,301 --> 02:09:47,670
the canvas is just the ice skating rink.

5117
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:48,691
It's terrible.

5118
02:09:48,691 --> 02:09:49,070
And then,

5119
02:09:49,070 --> 02:09:51,780
and if you've got logos
on the canvas as well,

5120
02:09:52,260 --> 02:09:54,150
Vaseline and the stickers and then,

5121
02:09:54,151 --> 02:09:54,451
yeah,

5122
02:09:54,451 --> 02:09:54,690
it's,

5123
02:09:54,690 --> 02:09:55,910
it's a complete nightmare.

5124
02:09:56,060 --> 02:09:56,521
Well that's a,

5125
02:09:56,521 --> 02:09:59,930
that was a nightmare in MMA for a while
that they would have all these ads on

5126
02:09:59,931 --> 02:10:03,350
the octagon and they would
spray these ads down with,

5127
02:10:03,380 --> 02:10:03,710
you know,

5128
02:10:03,710 --> 02:10:06,230
spray paint essentially or like,

5129
02:10:06,231 --> 02:10:06,740
um,

5130
02:10:06,740 --> 02:10:07,160
uh,

5131
02:10:07,160 --> 02:10:08,360
like an iron on.

5132
02:10:08,600 --> 02:10:09,440
And it would be,

5133
02:10:09,540 --> 02:10:11,480
it wouldn't absorb like canvas,

5134
02:10:11,660 --> 02:10:14,720
like cam for people don't know canvas.

5135
02:10:14,721 --> 02:10:15,501
When you get it wet,

5136
02:10:15,501 --> 02:10:17,180
actually you get more traction.

5137
02:10:17,420 --> 02:10:18,380
It's actually kind of Nice,

5138
02:10:18,560 --> 02:10:20,180
which is why when you watch MMA fight,

5139
02:10:20,181 --> 02:10:23,480
sometimes you see guys pour water on the
ground and then they'll move their feet

5140
02:10:23,481 --> 02:10:26,210
on the water because maybe their skin
is dry and they want to get their skin

5141
02:10:26,211 --> 02:10:27,170
nice and moist.

5142
02:10:27,440 --> 02:10:29,140
And it actually gives you
like a little traction.

5143
02:10:29,150 --> 02:10:31,610
A dry canvas sometimes can be slippery,

5144
02:10:31,850 --> 02:10:33,140
especially a fresh canvas.

5145
02:10:33,170 --> 02:10:33,710
Yes.

5146
02:10:33,710 --> 02:10:36,530
But those fucking logos of the worst,

5147
02:10:36,560 --> 02:10:37,970
especially those things are terrible.

5148
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:39,550
It's because in that painting on this,

5149
02:10:39,560 --> 02:10:41,270
even if there stickers that vinyl,

5150
02:10:41,420 --> 02:10:43,010
because it doesn't absorb any moisture.

5151
02:10:43,130 --> 02:10:44,210
So the moisture sits on.

5152
02:10:44,211 --> 02:10:44,881
If you step on it,

5153
02:10:44,881 --> 02:10:46,910
a whip and then you're
scared to throwing kicks.

5154
02:10:47,020 --> 02:10:48,020
So for our kicker,

5155
02:10:48,530 --> 02:10:50,180
who's doesn't want to go to the ground?

5156
02:10:50,360 --> 02:10:50,740
Oh,

5157
02:10:50,740 --> 02:10:51,411
it's a nightmare.

5158
02:10:51,411 --> 02:10:52,011
It's a mess.

5159
02:10:52,011 --> 02:10:52,341
Then you're,

5160
02:10:52,341 --> 02:10:54,920
you're one of your biggest
weapons has been removed.

5161
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:58,490
It's is good if you're got lazier
because then you can watch one canvas.

5162
02:10:58,491 --> 02:10:59,380
And then what's your opponent?

5163
02:10:59,400 --> 02:11:00,233
The same.

5164
02:11:01,220 --> 02:11:02,360
He's joking.

5165
02:11:02,880 --> 02:11:04,130
You can't do that if you have a lazy eye.

5166
02:11:04,131 --> 02:11:04,341
Right.

5167
02:11:04,341 --> 02:11:05,420
What the fuck do you have to pick?

5168
02:11:05,421 --> 02:11:06,530
Which I looked through did.

5169
02:11:06,531 --> 02:11:07,100
Um,

5170
02:11:07,100 --> 02:11:07,970
I used to have a girlfriend,

5171
02:11:07,990 --> 02:11:08,750
had a lazy boy.

5172
02:11:08,750 --> 02:11:08,901
Oh,

5173
02:11:08,901 --> 02:11:09,500
how dare you.

5174
02:11:09,500 --> 02:11:09,591
Uh,

5175
02:11:09,591 --> 02:11:10,310
jokes coming.

5176
02:11:10,310 --> 02:11:12,530
I had to get rid of her because
she was seeing other people.

5177
02:11:15,410 --> 02:11:16,460
I knew that joke.

5178
02:11:16,461 --> 02:11:17,570
He fucking got me with it.

5179
02:11:17,571 --> 02:11:17,890
Anyways,

5180
02:11:17,890 --> 02:11:18,890
it's kind of a bitch.

5181
02:11:19,580 --> 02:11:21,200
How dare you?

5182
02:11:21,800 --> 02:11:22,633
How dare you?

5183
02:11:22,880 --> 02:11:23,860
I knew that one common,

5184
02:11:24,110 --> 02:11:24,881
I knew that joke,

5185
02:11:24,881 --> 02:11:25,714
but I knew a job.

5186
02:11:25,760 --> 02:11:26,121
First of all,

5187
02:11:26,121 --> 02:11:28,100
I knew a joke was coming cause you had a,

5188
02:11:28,280 --> 02:11:32,600
here's a joke coming up in your face
and I heard that one but I forgot it.

5189
02:11:33,030 --> 02:11:34,040
Fucking marijuana

5190
02:11:35,640 --> 02:11:37,610
long term memory got me.

5191
02:11:37,700 --> 02:11:38,533
Damn.

5192
02:11:40,560 --> 02:11:43,640
I got to try and keep my brain in tech
so I can try and be funny like you.

5193
02:11:44,260 --> 02:11:45,250
That's one.

5194
02:11:45,300 --> 02:11:47,270
Another thing on longevity in this sport.

5195
02:11:47,390 --> 02:11:50,150
Well your brain's amazingly
intact for 120 fights.

5196
02:11:50,180 --> 02:11:50,770
That's incredible.

5197
02:11:50,770 --> 02:11:51,680
You've taught most people,

5198
02:11:51,681 --> 02:11:53,270
what's the guy going to
be like 39 years old?

5199
02:11:53,271 --> 02:11:54,360
He was 120 fights off.

5200
02:11:54,361 --> 02:11:55,740
Fucking God can't even wipe his own ass.

5201
02:11:55,760 --> 02:11:57,320
You gotta hire people to do that.

5202
02:11:57,410 --> 02:11:57,890
Okay,

5203
02:11:57,890 --> 02:11:58,723
you're fine.

5204
02:11:59,240 --> 02:12:00,530
But what do you think that that is?

5205
02:12:00,530 --> 02:12:01,363
Just a,

5206
02:12:01,520 --> 02:12:04,700
because of all that sparring as well,

5207
02:12:04,840 --> 02:12:05,140
that,

5208
02:12:05,140 --> 02:12:05,973
that um,

5209
02:12:06,200 --> 02:12:06,980
you know,

5210
02:12:06,980 --> 02:12:09,350
very technical what we call playing,

5211
02:12:09,560 --> 02:12:12,740
where he'd just tapping
each other and not hard,

5212
02:12:12,890 --> 02:12:13,251
you know,

5213
02:12:13,251 --> 02:12:14,150
Ramon Decker,

5214
02:12:14,151 --> 02:12:17,210
Dutch style fighting in the gym every day.

5215
02:12:17,300 --> 02:12:18,081
But instead,

5216
02:12:18,081 --> 02:12:19,650
just so we're working on technique work,

5217
02:12:19,970 --> 02:12:20,820
well I'll put a different tech,

5218
02:12:21,140 --> 02:12:21,770
different um,

5219
02:12:21,770 --> 02:12:23,120
theories with boxes.

5220
02:12:23,121 --> 02:12:23,571
For instance,

5221
02:12:23,571 --> 02:12:26,090
boxes we'll spar for twice a week,

5222
02:12:26,091 --> 02:12:28,280
three times a week leading
up to a fight for 10 weeks.

5223
02:12:28,670 --> 02:12:33,410
And then their brain damage is caused
from the sparring and not actually fight,

5224
02:12:33,411 --> 02:12:36,440
but the actual preparation
and then times that by a 30,

5225
02:12:36,441 --> 02:12:36,951
40 flights.

5226
02:12:36,951 --> 02:12:37,071
What,

5227
02:12:37,071 --> 02:12:39,170
how many fighters have more
than 40 fights in boxing?

5228
02:12:39,550 --> 02:12:40,400
So,

5229
02:12:40,440 --> 02:12:42,430
so I don't know.

5230
02:12:42,560 --> 02:12:43,940
I've been hit with a lot of hot shorts.

5231
02:12:43,941 --> 02:12:44,070
We,

5232
02:12:44,070 --> 02:12:46,970
a lot of people say how come a normal
person would be knocked out and you

5233
02:12:46,971 --> 02:12:47,360
didn't,

5234
02:12:47,360 --> 02:12:49,010
I guess it's just just luck.

5235
02:12:49,460 --> 02:12:51,410
I have nothing but luck
to you have a good chin.

5236
02:12:51,650 --> 02:12:51,951
Yeah.

5237
02:12:51,951 --> 02:12:52,860
Lucky that is not,

5238
02:12:52,910 --> 02:12:53,230
uh,

5239
02:12:53,230 --> 02:12:54,780
not uh,

5240
02:12:54,940 --> 02:12:55,520
goaling yet.

5241
02:12:55,520 --> 02:12:56,353
Um,

5242
02:12:56,630 --> 02:12:56,781
yeah.

5243
02:12:56,781 --> 02:12:58,820
Good Chin is really for,

5244
02:12:59,450 --> 02:13:00,283
you know,

5245
02:13:00,340 --> 02:13:01,280
cause my whack me.

5246
02:13:01,281 --> 02:13:01,760
Huh?

5247
02:13:01,760 --> 02:13:02,593
He certainly,

5248
02:13:02,600 --> 02:13:03,201
he didn't miss,

5249
02:13:03,201 --> 02:13:05,540
he got me multiple times
with the flying knee man.

5250
02:13:05,570 --> 02:13:05,871
Yeah.

5251
02:13:05,871 --> 02:13:08,330
One flying knee was at the second
round and he caught you with that.

5252
02:13:08,420 --> 02:13:09,140
Um,

5253
02:13:09,140 --> 02:13:10,370
I don't remember what round it was.

5254
02:13:10,430 --> 02:13:11,300
Second or third round.

5255
02:13:11,301 --> 02:13:11,361
He,

5256
02:13:11,361 --> 02:13:12,410
he would have flying knee.

5257
02:13:12,411 --> 02:13:13,930
But you know,

5258
02:13:14,240 --> 02:13:15,300
never had you heard,

5259
02:13:15,320 --> 02:13:16,340
never had you down.

5260
02:13:16,341 --> 02:13:17,540
Never had you wobbly.

5261
02:13:17,570 --> 02:13:18,370
Yeah,

5262
02:13:18,370 --> 02:13:18,891
cuts hurt.

5263
02:13:18,891 --> 02:13:20,290
But at the same time I knew there was no,

5264
02:13:20,600 --> 02:13:23,300
there wasn't one point in the flight
where I thought all kind of go in and it's

5265
02:13:23,301 --> 02:13:23,840
like nine,

5266
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:24,140
nine.

5267
02:13:24,140 --> 02:13:25,350
Every time he hit me hard,

5268
02:13:25,530 --> 02:13:26,990
it was more so I've got to get it back.

5269
02:13:27,180 --> 02:13:29,050
And there's a difference between the,

5270
02:13:29,080 --> 02:13:31,950
the phrase had you heard and hurt

5271
02:13:32,310 --> 02:13:33,143
like a,

5272
02:13:33,420 --> 02:13:34,830
people listen to that.

5273
02:13:34,831 --> 02:13:35,101
And I go,

5274
02:13:35,101 --> 02:13:35,221
well,

5275
02:13:35,221 --> 02:13:36,360
of course he got hurt.

5276
02:13:36,361 --> 02:13:36,901
He got hit.

5277
02:13:36,901 --> 02:13:37,500
He got,

5278
02:13:37,500 --> 02:13:39,060
you already said he
had all these stitches.

5279
02:13:39,510 --> 02:13:42,150
When someone says in the fighting world,

5280
02:13:42,151 --> 02:13:45,300
he was hurt and means his
body is not functioning right.

5281
02:13:45,360 --> 02:13:48,690
You got whacked and all sudden you see
your legs go rubber or you see a guy

5282
02:13:48,691 --> 02:13:51,780
cover up maybe to a liver shot
and you realize he's hurt.

5283
02:13:52,140 --> 02:13:52,973
He's hurt,

5284
02:13:53,310 --> 02:13:57,570
doesn't have a window near the point where
I thought if I get hit one more time,

5285
02:13:57,571 --> 02:13:58,111
I'm going to go down.

5286
02:13:58,111 --> 02:14:01,170
There is no point whatsoever during the
flight that I was getting hit at the

5287
02:14:01,171 --> 02:14:02,580
same time I,

5288
02:14:02,730 --> 02:14:04,830
there was never a moment where I thought,

5289
02:14:04,860 --> 02:14:07,660
I can't not win this fight
until that bill rent.

5290
02:14:07,661 --> 02:14:08,011
And it's like,

5291
02:14:08,011 --> 02:14:08,251
okay,

5292
02:14:08,251 --> 02:14:11,490
now I'm at a time when you watched the
fight and the replay did that fourth

5293
02:14:11,491 --> 02:14:14,100
round incident when you cracked him with
that punch and he started cleaning his

5294
02:14:14,101 --> 02:14:14,370
feet.

5295
02:14:14,370 --> 02:14:14,471
The,

5296
02:14:14,471 --> 02:14:15,630
that drives me fucking nuts.

5297
02:14:15,660 --> 02:14:16,650
I haven't watched the fight yet.

5298
02:14:16,740 --> 02:14:17,161
Oh,

5299
02:14:17,161 --> 02:14:21,300
say disappointed in
myself to be very angry.

5300
02:14:21,630 --> 02:14:23,010
When you watch that fourth round,

5301
02:14:23,011 --> 02:14:25,430
you're going to carry out the dude,

5302
02:14:25,440 --> 02:14:26,970
the courage up to watch
it because I'm still,

5303
02:14:26,971 --> 02:14:27,990
I'm still trying to get over it.

5304
02:14:27,991 --> 02:14:29,160
That and it's,

5305
02:14:29,210 --> 02:14:29,470
it's,

5306
02:14:29,470 --> 02:14:31,080
it's heartbreaking when you lose man.

5307
02:14:31,081 --> 02:14:31,770
It sucks.

5308
02:14:31,770 --> 02:14:32,800
I can only imagine.

5309
02:14:32,910 --> 02:14:37,910
So invested that 10 weeks and then
all you want and I can taste it.

5310
02:14:38,161 --> 02:14:38,994
I want it.

5311
02:14:39,360 --> 02:14:40,970
I can feel the belt around my waist.

5312
02:14:40,971 --> 02:14:42,270
So I want to,

5313
02:14:42,360 --> 02:14:45,510
and then when the decision
comes and they raise up,

5314
02:14:45,511 --> 02:14:46,740
position his hand and it's just,

5315
02:14:46,830 --> 02:14:48,270
it's a heartbreaking.

5316
02:14:48,750 --> 02:14:49,231
And then,

5317
02:14:49,231 --> 02:14:51,220
and then look at people's faces that um,

5318
02:14:51,390 --> 02:14:52,380
believed in you as well.

5319
02:14:52,381 --> 02:14:53,640
Like hands with them.

5320
02:14:54,240 --> 02:14:55,160
He came on board with one.

5321
02:14:55,161 --> 02:14:56,820
So just before this fight come up and say,

5322
02:14:56,850 --> 02:14:57,001
yeah,

5323
02:14:57,001 --> 02:14:57,301
again,

5324
02:14:57,301 --> 02:14:58,690
I've got to thank them for
coming on board as a whole,

5325
02:14:58,691 --> 02:15:01,590
but monster energy drain
once that like Ted for them,

5326
02:15:01,591 --> 02:15:02,580
this funds or wait till I go.

5327
02:15:02,590 --> 02:15:03,480
Like I said,

5328
02:15:03,540 --> 02:15:03,961
I want to,

5329
02:15:03,961 --> 02:15:06,330
I want to wind it to be for them.

5330
02:15:06,331 --> 02:15:09,660
They'd be proud to have their logo
on my shorts and then when you lose,

5331
02:15:09,661 --> 02:15:10,950
I've got to look at
hands and the face and,

5332
02:15:10,951 --> 02:15:11,250
and thinking,

5333
02:15:11,250 --> 02:15:12,083
fuck me,

5334
02:15:12,180 --> 02:15:13,320
I'm sorry I let you down.

5335
02:15:13,680 --> 02:15:14,350
Listen man,

5336
02:15:14,350 --> 02:15:15,420
you didn't let anybody down.

5337
02:15:15,421 --> 02:15:18,250
You fought a great fight against
it and a world class fighter.

5338
02:15:18,251 --> 02:15:19,170
I mean Cosmo,

5339
02:15:19,171 --> 02:15:20,760
Xander is a bad motherfucker.

5340
02:15:21,320 --> 02:15:22,350
You fought a great fight,

5341
02:15:22,380 --> 02:15:22,771
but you know,

5342
02:15:22,771 --> 02:15:23,450
you know what I mean?

5343
02:15:23,450 --> 02:15:23,550
It's,

5344
02:15:23,550 --> 02:15:23,811
it's,

5345
02:15:23,811 --> 02:15:24,051
it's,

5346
02:15:24,051 --> 02:15:25,530
it's so many people.

5347
02:15:26,130 --> 02:15:26,461
And then,

5348
02:15:26,461 --> 02:15:27,480
and then my little girl,

5349
02:15:27,481 --> 02:15:28,470
she's 12 years old,

5350
02:15:28,471 --> 02:15:30,390
she's sitting in front row and then,

5351
02:15:30,391 --> 02:15:30,720
uh,

5352
02:15:30,720 --> 02:15:31,320
my wife said,

5353
02:15:31,320 --> 02:15:31,861
oh yeah,

5354
02:15:31,861 --> 02:15:34,140
she was in tears because when dead,

5355
02:15:34,141 --> 02:15:35,400
she's just saying that winning.

5356
02:15:35,700 --> 02:15:36,411
So when dad's not,

5357
02:15:36,411 --> 02:15:37,290
not only did he lose,

5358
02:15:37,291 --> 02:15:39,270
but he's caught up and
he's limping and he's um,

5359
02:15:39,450 --> 02:15:40,283
broken.

5360
02:15:40,500 --> 02:15:41,400
It's um,

5361
02:15:41,430 --> 02:15:42,263
it sucks.

5362
02:15:42,370 --> 02:15:43,050
Yeah.

5363
02:15:43,050 --> 02:15:43,890
But it doesn't,

5364
02:15:44,520 --> 02:15:48,030
it doesn't diminish your
enthusiasm for wanting to compete.

5365
02:15:48,120 --> 02:15:48,361
Yeah.

5366
02:15:48,361 --> 02:15:48,480
He,

5367
02:15:48,480 --> 02:15:48,770
oh,

5368
02:15:48,770 --> 02:15:49,471
I'm kind of waiting.

5369
02:15:49,471 --> 02:15:50,940
I'm fighting Siris and
the 5th of December,

5370
02:15:50,941 --> 02:15:51,540
so,

5371
02:15:51,540 --> 02:15:52,261
so once,

5372
02:15:52,261 --> 02:15:53,180
once my foot sealed,

5373
02:15:53,190 --> 02:15:54,001
I'll get back to Australia,

5374
02:15:54,001 --> 02:15:54,681
I'll get back on the road.

5375
02:15:54,681 --> 02:15:55,800
It's the back on the pads and the,

5376
02:15:55,801 --> 02:15:58,180
and now I'm more determined to
make up for this lofts are why.

5377
02:15:58,190 --> 02:16:00,330
And I make sure that I'm
not only gonna beat saw it,

5378
02:16:00,890 --> 02:16:01,290
um,

5379
02:16:01,290 --> 02:16:03,390
but I have to go out
there and destroy him.

5380
02:16:03,391 --> 02:16:03,770
Tim,

5381
02:16:03,770 --> 02:16:06,270
get back my credibility
is one of the top guys.

5382
02:16:06,810 --> 02:16:09,780
Are you still fighting that
black dynamite do this?

5383
02:16:09,870 --> 02:16:10,110
Yes.

5384
02:16:10,110 --> 02:16:10,710
Source.

5385
02:16:10,710 --> 02:16:13,170
That's his name is full name.

5386
02:16:13,171 --> 02:16:14,470
So as Washington source.

5387
02:16:14,520 --> 02:16:16,020
Cyrus Cyrus.

5388
02:16:16,021 --> 02:16:16,291
Okay.

5389
02:16:16,291 --> 02:16:17,250
That's where I got confused.

5390
02:16:17,251 --> 02:16:17,550
Yeah.

5391
02:16:17,550 --> 02:16:21,210
You were saying Saurus s O.

5392
02:16:21,210 --> 02:16:21,210
R.

5393
02:16:21,210 --> 02:16:21,210
O.

5394
02:16:21,210 --> 02:16:21,600
S.

5395
02:16:21,600 --> 02:16:21,841
I was like,

5396
02:16:21,841 --> 02:16:22,674
who the fuck is that?

5397
02:16:23,020 --> 02:16:25,920
But Cyrus Wa Goddamn Australian accent.

5398
02:16:25,950 --> 02:16:26,260
Yes.

5399
02:16:26,260 --> 02:16:28,590
Iris Washington is a,

5400
02:16:28,650 --> 02:16:29,710
he's a wild days.

5401
02:16:30,460 --> 02:16:31,660
If you were in my country,

5402
02:16:31,661 --> 02:16:33,060
you don't have good point.

5403
02:16:33,100 --> 02:16:34,470
Yes.

5404
02:16:35,600 --> 02:16:38,660
The country being a
country next month say,

5405
02:16:38,740 --> 02:16:38,950
yeah.

5406
02:16:38,950 --> 02:16:41,650
Say sorry in the cage and the cage.

5407
02:16:41,690 --> 02:16:42,523
MMA gloves.

5408
02:16:42,820 --> 02:16:43,653
Moitai rules.

5409
02:16:43,920 --> 02:16:45,100
That's a pain killer too.

5410
02:16:45,101 --> 02:16:46,090
He's another killer.

5411
02:16:46,270 --> 02:16:46,781
He's a,

5412
02:16:46,781 --> 02:16:47,171
he's,

5413
02:16:47,171 --> 02:16:49,720
he's exactly like the gentleman you
were saying from glory with the,

5414
02:16:49,730 --> 02:16:49,980
the,

5415
02:16:49,980 --> 02:16:50,813
the Daniel.

5416
02:16:50,920 --> 02:16:51,820
The spinning kicks in.

5417
02:16:51,821 --> 02:16:54,340
The hook kicks in a the
crazy style and the,

5418
02:16:54,490 --> 02:16:57,730
but he's more adapted to
more time Cyrus House.

5419
02:16:57,880 --> 02:16:58,160
Yes.

5420
02:16:58,160 --> 02:16:58,330
You know,

5421
02:16:58,330 --> 02:16:58,630
he's,

5422
02:16:58,630 --> 02:16:59,500
he's a wild,

5423
02:16:59,501 --> 02:17:00,221
got a watch my,

5424
02:17:00,221 --> 02:17:01,360
he does a lot of crazy shit.

5425
02:17:01,590 --> 02:17:03,430
A lot of spinning back kick to the body.

5426
02:17:03,460 --> 02:17:07,840
I put a highlight reel of his on Facebook
the other day and the amount of people

5427
02:17:07,841 --> 02:17:08,351
that watch the,

5428
02:17:08,351 --> 02:17:08,711
I'm just like,

5429
02:17:08,711 --> 02:17:09,450
what are you doing?

5430
02:17:09,450 --> 02:17:11,590
[inaudible] and suppose cause he's good.

5431
02:17:11,591 --> 02:17:11,870
I why?

5432
02:17:11,870 --> 02:17:12,400
Why don't,

5433
02:17:12,400 --> 02:17:13,150
why don't want to find him?

5434
02:17:13,150 --> 02:17:13,983
Because he's awesome.

5435
02:17:14,350 --> 02:17:17,710
He's going to bring such an entertaining
fight for the Australian crowd that

5436
02:17:18,080 --> 02:17:18,550
they,

5437
02:17:18,550 --> 02:17:20,810
they're going to be crazy if they don't
come along and watch it because it's

5438
02:17:20,830 --> 02:17:21,670
going to be madness.

5439
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:22,211
Yeah.

5440
02:17:22,211 --> 02:17:22,670
He's,

5441
02:17:22,670 --> 02:17:25,350
he's an interesting guy and um,

5442
02:17:25,450 --> 02:17:30,130
he's a black belt in taekwondo as well
as being very proficient at Moitai at a

5443
02:17:30,131 --> 02:17:31,360
world class level.

5444
02:17:31,361 --> 02:17:34,450
And combining those two things
together is very interesting.

5445
02:17:34,451 --> 02:17:36,640
It's like we're talking to
the knuckle boxing as well.

5446
02:17:36,641 --> 02:17:37,270
He's,

5447
02:17:37,270 --> 02:17:40,690
he's fighting with headbutts bare
knuckle boxing with headbutts.

5448
02:17:40,850 --> 02:17:41,070
Oh,

5449
02:17:41,070 --> 02:17:41,920
where's he doing that?

5450
02:17:41,940 --> 02:17:42,300
Uh,

5451
02:17:42,300 --> 02:17:43,690
either Cambodia.

5452
02:17:43,720 --> 02:17:44,830
Uh,

5453
02:17:46,240 --> 02:17:46,580
yeah.

5454
02:17:46,580 --> 02:17:49,570
So what happens when you get hurt and
you've got to go to the hospital in

5455
02:17:49,571 --> 02:17:50,404
Cambodia,

5456
02:17:50,800 --> 02:17:52,570
they just give you your own chicken,

5457
02:17:53,070 --> 02:17:53,950
do your own food.

5458
02:17:54,870 --> 02:17:55,703
They give you a ball,

5459
02:17:55,930 --> 02:17:59,290
a ball of yarn and fish hook
cause stitch yourself together.

5460
02:17:59,291 --> 02:17:59,651
Bitch,

5461
02:17:59,651 --> 02:18:00,484
we're done.

5462
02:18:00,850 --> 02:18:02,050
Oh fuck man.

5463
02:18:02,340 --> 02:18:05,430
I say say hopefully he doesn't have his
natural instinct that's trying to hit

5464
02:18:05,450 --> 02:18:06,283
button in the clinch.

5465
02:18:06,610 --> 02:18:06,921
Yeah,

5466
02:18:06,921 --> 02:18:07,481
no kidding.

5467
02:18:07,481 --> 02:18:08,314
Right.

5468
02:18:08,710 --> 02:18:10,180
How many fights does he do like that?

5469
02:18:10,270 --> 02:18:11,103
Uh,

5470
02:18:11,140 --> 02:18:11,530
from,

5471
02:18:11,530 --> 02:18:13,000
from his Facebook record that I,

5472
02:18:13,001 --> 02:18:13,940
that I shared when I,

5473
02:18:14,020 --> 02:18:14,853
when the,

5474
02:18:15,220 --> 02:18:16,960
when the match first got made,

5475
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:17,650
um,

5476
02:18:17,650 --> 02:18:18,850
he was like 70,

5477
02:18:18,910 --> 02:18:19,810
with 50 wins,

5478
02:18:19,811 --> 02:18:20,830
47 knockouts.

5479
02:18:22,030 --> 02:18:23,590
So Jesus,

5480
02:18:24,280 --> 02:18:26,260
I believe he said a few
more fights in that he said,

5481
02:18:26,261 --> 02:18:26,351
oh,

5482
02:18:26,351 --> 02:18:29,170
that's actually my older record
album and it's actually a listener.

5483
02:18:29,440 --> 02:18:32,010
But when I got off his Facebook
and then people go and what,

5484
02:18:32,020 --> 02:18:33,040
you're 39,

5485
02:18:33,430 --> 02:18:33,911
uh,

5486
02:18:33,911 --> 02:18:35,980
you're not in your prime anymore.

5487
02:18:35,981 --> 02:18:37,810
Why would you fight someone
so dangerous for us?

5488
02:18:37,811 --> 02:18:42,811
Because I want to give the Australian
public in the fans flights that you're

5489
02:18:42,821 --> 02:18:44,410
going to not want to miss.

5490
02:18:44,470 --> 02:18:46,750
When people say that
you know your prime no,

5491
02:18:46,751 --> 02:18:48,940
you still fight like you're in your prime.

5492
02:18:48,970 --> 02:18:49,803
I feel like a number.

5493
02:18:49,930 --> 02:18:51,270
You're not fighting like,

5494
02:18:51,320 --> 02:18:51,510
uh,

5495
02:18:51,510 --> 02:18:52,810
like when I watched you fight,

5496
02:18:53,110 --> 02:18:54,430
I'm watching you fight cosmo.

5497
02:18:54,431 --> 02:18:59,431
Who's a big strong guy and you're not
fighting like a guy who was over the hill.

5498
02:18:59,650 --> 02:19:04,330
You're fighting like a cautious smart
veteran who's facing a very dangerous fast

5499
02:19:04,331 --> 02:19:06,520
guy and you far very well.

5500
02:19:06,550 --> 02:19:07,383
It wasn't,

5501
02:19:07,480 --> 02:19:08,650
it wasn't like a fire like,

5502
02:19:08,651 --> 02:19:09,131
oh man,

5503
02:19:09,131 --> 02:19:10,390
this guy's lost a step.

5504
02:19:10,450 --> 02:19:11,650
It wasn't like that man,

5505
02:19:11,920 --> 02:19:12,221
you know,

5506
02:19:12,221 --> 02:19:12,450
I'm,

5507
02:19:12,450 --> 02:19:13,330
I'm an honest dude.

5508
02:19:13,331 --> 02:19:15,160
If I see someone losing a step,

5509
02:19:15,180 --> 02:19:17,890
it makes me very concerned because that,

5510
02:19:17,891 --> 02:19:20,350
trying to pretend that that didn't happen.

5511
02:19:20,351 --> 02:19:21,400
It's super dangerous.

5512
02:19:21,760 --> 02:19:22,481
I don't see that with,

5513
02:19:22,481 --> 02:19:26,650
the only time that I feel old is when
someone asks me because in the gym I feel

5514
02:19:26,651 --> 02:19:27,740
like I'm still 25,

5515
02:19:27,741 --> 02:19:28,610
but when someone says,

5516
02:19:28,611 --> 02:19:29,080
how are Ya?

5517
02:19:29,080 --> 02:19:29,913
And then when I leave,

5518
02:19:29,960 --> 02:19:32,210
when I hear the word lead
my lips and I say 39,

5519
02:19:32,211 --> 02:19:32,451
it's like,

5520
02:19:32,451 --> 02:19:33,050
fuck.

5521
02:19:33,050 --> 02:19:35,930
That's to attribute
that to consistency or,

5522
02:19:35,931 --> 02:19:36,261
I mean,

5523
02:19:36,261 --> 02:19:37,700
you very clean with your diet.

5524
02:19:37,730 --> 02:19:38,563
Like what is it?

5525
02:19:39,580 --> 02:19:40,200
I,

5526
02:19:40,200 --> 02:19:41,280
I had and I,

5527
02:19:41,290 --> 02:19:41,721
he just,

5528
02:19:41,721 --> 02:19:42,170
um,

5529
02:19:42,170 --> 02:19:43,130
what's your diet like?

5530
02:19:43,250 --> 02:19:43,341
Uh,

5531
02:19:43,341 --> 02:19:43,880
it's okay.

5532
02:19:43,880 --> 02:19:44,510
Uh,

5533
02:19:44,510 --> 02:19:45,021
my wife's,

5534
02:19:45,021 --> 02:19:45,710
um,

5535
02:19:45,710 --> 02:19:46,520
uh,

5536
02:19:46,520 --> 02:19:47,910
half Mexican American,

5537
02:19:47,911 --> 02:19:51,440
so she cooked of Tacos,

5538
02:19:51,440 --> 02:19:51,440
Tacos,

5539
02:19:51,440 --> 02:19:52,130
Tacos,

5540
02:19:52,130 --> 02:19:52,281
I,

5541
02:19:52,281 --> 02:19:53,031
lots of Thai food.

5542
02:19:53,031 --> 02:19:53,661
What's to Asian?

5543
02:19:53,661 --> 02:19:54,494
Lots of Japanese.

5544
02:19:54,530 --> 02:19:55,110
We,

5545
02:19:55,110 --> 02:19:55,490
uh,

5546
02:19:55,490 --> 02:19:56,540
to avoid anything.

5547
02:19:56,541 --> 02:19:56,691
Like,

5548
02:19:56,691 --> 02:19:59,530
do you avoid sugar or alcohol or uh,

5549
02:20:00,040 --> 02:20:00,380
uh,

5550
02:20:00,380 --> 02:20:00,960
OPM,

5551
02:20:00,960 --> 02:20:01,793
heroin?

5552
02:20:01,920 --> 02:20:02,470
No,

5553
02:20:02,470 --> 02:20:03,303
I stay away from those.

5554
02:20:04,990 --> 02:20:05,823
Especially like

5555
02:20:07,550 --> 02:20:07,941
try,

5556
02:20:07,941 --> 02:20:12,941
I try while they're very compelling
a year but not evidence I hamburgers,

5557
02:20:14,291 --> 02:20:14,551
I'm,

5558
02:20:14,551 --> 02:20:14,960
I'm,

5559
02:20:14,960 --> 02:20:16,250
I can't say that I'm a saint.

5560
02:20:16,310 --> 02:20:17,180
I'm definitely,

5561
02:20:17,420 --> 02:20:18,141
but I don't drink,

5562
02:20:18,141 --> 02:20:18,974
I don't really,

5563
02:20:19,160 --> 02:20:20,930
I'm lucky to have five busy year,

5564
02:20:21,260 --> 02:20:22,260
so I stay off there.

5565
02:20:22,280 --> 02:20:22,910
That'll help.

5566
02:20:22,910 --> 02:20:23,810
That'll help a lot.

5567
02:20:24,030 --> 02:20:25,070
That has longevity.

5568
02:20:25,880 --> 02:20:26,530
You get like,

5569
02:20:26,530 --> 02:20:27,190
um,

5570
02:20:27,190 --> 02:20:27,590
uh,

5571
02:20:27,590 --> 02:20:31,070
hopeful when you see garlic Bernard
Hopkins fucking 50 years old.

5572
02:20:31,310 --> 02:20:31,760
I do.

5573
02:20:31,760 --> 02:20:33,570
He's probably that guy.

5574
02:20:33,600 --> 02:20:34,490
And then also,

5575
02:20:34,580 --> 02:20:35,300
uh,

5576
02:20:35,300 --> 02:20:36,440
lucky you were saying before,

5577
02:20:36,740 --> 02:20:37,573
uh,

5578
02:20:37,850 --> 02:20:38,570
Randy couture,

5579
02:20:38,570 --> 02:20:42,860
he's also a gentleman that is proving
that you can still fight with the guys

5580
02:20:42,861 --> 02:20:45,200
that are in their late twenties,

5581
02:20:45,201 --> 02:20:46,034
early thirties.

5582
02:20:46,130 --> 02:20:46,341
Yeah.

5583
02:20:46,341 --> 02:20:49,850
He won a world championship
level deep into his forties.

5584
02:20:49,880 --> 02:20:50,440
Yay.

5585
02:20:50,440 --> 02:20:52,010
And then again,

5586
02:20:52,400 --> 02:20:55,010
another gentleman that can
put a conversation together
that's heading up all

5587
02:20:55,011 --> 02:20:56,380
these flights in Bernal Hopkins.

5588
02:20:56,381 --> 02:20:56,490
Uh,

5589
02:20:56,490 --> 02:20:56,900
again,

5590
02:20:56,900 --> 02:20:57,620
uh,

5591
02:20:57,620 --> 02:20:58,220
uh,

5592
02:20:58,220 --> 02:20:58,940
it's just,

5593
02:20:58,940 --> 02:20:59,110
yeah,

5594
02:20:59,110 --> 02:21:01,250
Randy is completely lucid.

5595
02:21:01,760 --> 02:21:02,571
He's talking to him,

5596
02:21:02,571 --> 02:21:03,470
he's articulate.

5597
02:21:03,471 --> 02:21:05,020
He's a gentleman entrepreneur.

5598
02:21:05,140 --> 02:21:05,490
He's,

5599
02:21:05,490 --> 02:21:05,631
he's,

5600
02:21:05,631 --> 02:21:06,361
and he's not silly.

5601
02:21:06,361 --> 02:21:06,861
He is making,

5602
02:21:06,861 --> 02:21:08,990
he's making money from
a different avenues.

5603
02:21:08,991 --> 02:21:10,640
So I saw him hitting the
pounds the other day.

5604
02:21:10,641 --> 02:21:15,420
He was working out with Jay Glazer
scenario war does the NFL for Fox and you

5605
02:21:15,421 --> 02:21:15,530
know,

5606
02:21:15,530 --> 02:21:18,140
Jay was holding the pads form and
Randy was hitting them and I was like,

5607
02:21:18,141 --> 02:21:19,490
I wonder what the fuck he's doing.

5608
02:21:19,820 --> 02:21:21,060
I wonder if he sees fade orange.

5609
02:21:21,080 --> 02:21:21,521
He's like,

5610
02:21:21,521 --> 02:21:21,821
you know,

5611
02:21:21,821 --> 02:21:22,654
US and man,

5612
02:21:22,940 --> 02:21:24,860
I'll fucking take that one big fight.

5613
02:21:25,310 --> 02:21:26,270
Cause Shit,

5614
02:21:26,271 --> 02:21:27,800
he could probably make
a shit load of money.

5615
02:21:27,860 --> 02:21:28,910
Even Shane Mosley,

5616
02:21:28,911 --> 02:21:29,744
Shane Mosley.

5617
02:21:29,950 --> 02:21:30,470
Um,

5618
02:21:30,470 --> 02:21:32,330
but Randy might still be under contract.

5619
02:21:32,990 --> 02:21:37,000
He might still have like some UFC
contract thing going on and mom didn't,

5620
02:21:37,010 --> 02:21:41,210
Dana expelling from UFC where he's not
allowed to enter the arena is anymore or

5621
02:21:41,211 --> 02:21:42,044
something.

5622
02:21:44,250 --> 02:21:45,083
I don't know.

5623
02:21:45,860 --> 02:21:46,820
How do you do that?

5624
02:21:47,120 --> 02:21:48,880
Like I can do whatever the
fuck you want if I'm wrong,

5625
02:21:48,900 --> 02:21:49,170
you know,

5626
02:21:49,170 --> 02:21:51,320
so Randy coture go,

5627
02:21:51,321 --> 02:21:52,160
go fight your mom.

5628
02:21:52,610 --> 02:21:53,443
I'll give a shit.

5629
02:21:54,290 --> 02:21:55,670
You always get ringside seats.

5630
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:56,391
You know,

5631
02:21:56,391 --> 02:21:57,530
that's captain America.

5632
02:21:58,220 --> 02:21:59,053
I Dunno.

5633
02:21:59,310 --> 02:22:01,370
I don't know if he did come back.

5634
02:22:01,371 --> 02:22:02,810
It would be weird because he's,

5635
02:22:02,811 --> 02:22:06,920
he's been off for a long time and the
last time he fought I believe was in

5636
02:22:06,921 --> 02:22:11,921
Toronto at the Rogers arena and he got
chumping front kicked in the face by Leo

5637
02:22:12,590 --> 02:22:13,430
Machida knocked out.

5638
02:22:13,470 --> 02:22:14,000
And the Cheetah,

5639
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,280
that was the famous tags Stephen's ago.

5640
02:22:16,980 --> 02:22:21,120
That was the first time that anyone has
ever won by a friend kick to the face

5641
02:22:21,121 --> 02:22:22,550
since Steven Seagal and vented it.

5642
02:22:22,700 --> 02:22:22,971
Well,

5643
02:22:22,971 --> 02:22:23,870
jumping front,

5644
02:22:23,910 --> 02:22:24,743
jumping phase,

5645
02:22:24,770 --> 02:22:26,130
jumping Anderson had won

5646
02:22:26,130 --> 02:22:27,870
by a front kick to the face before.

5647
02:22:28,950 --> 02:22:29,783
I apologize.

5648
02:22:29,890 --> 02:22:30,723
It was this,

5649
02:22:30,750 --> 02:22:31,980
that was the Stephen as he goes.

5650
02:22:31,990 --> 02:22:35,460
Have you ever tried a jumping front
kick to the face in a Muay Thai fight?

5651
02:22:35,580 --> 02:22:36,390
Jumping Frankie?

5652
02:22:36,390 --> 02:22:36,810
No,

5653
02:22:36,810 --> 02:22:37,290
but I,

5654
02:22:37,290 --> 02:22:38,100
I landed a friend,

5655
02:22:38,100 --> 02:22:38,450
uh,

5656
02:22:38,450 --> 02:22:38,600
I,

5657
02:22:38,600 --> 02:22:42,450
I used to try and land one frank kick
to the face every fight as like a,

5658
02:22:42,451 --> 02:22:42,841
as a,

5659
02:22:42,841 --> 02:22:45,510
as a trademark thing back
when I was in my early.

5660
02:22:45,740 --> 02:22:46,260
Really?

5661
02:22:46,260 --> 02:22:46,540
Yeah.

5662
02:22:46,540 --> 02:22:46,771
Yeah.

5663
02:22:46,771 --> 02:22:47,190
That was my,

5664
02:22:47,190 --> 02:22:49,500
that was my thing to try
lane when I actually,

5665
02:22:49,560 --> 02:22:49,891
actually,

5666
02:22:49,891 --> 02:22:50,520
my wife,

5667
02:22:50,520 --> 02:22:51,270
uh,

5668
02:22:51,270 --> 02:22:53,460
she was known as a German June.

5669
02:22:53,710 --> 02:22:54,543
Now John,

5670
02:22:54,720 --> 02:22:55,170
John,

5671
02:22:55,170 --> 02:22:55,441
hang on,

5672
02:22:55,441 --> 02:22:55,651
hang on,

5673
02:22:55,651 --> 02:22:55,860
hang on.

5674
02:22:55,860 --> 02:22:56,693
What is it?

5675
02:22:58,530 --> 02:22:59,070
So her,

5676
02:22:59,070 --> 02:23:01,620
her Thai name translated
was the beautiful face.

5677
02:23:02,010 --> 02:23:03,000
Beautiful Frankie.

5678
02:23:03,330 --> 02:23:05,730
Keep face the beautiful,

5679
02:23:06,360 --> 02:23:07,360
beautiful friend.

5680
02:23:07,361 --> 02:23:08,760
Keep face a face.

5681
02:23:08,870 --> 02:23:11,740
Teamplay that sounds cooler and time.

5682
02:23:12,020 --> 02:23:13,190
How do you in Thai,

5683
02:23:14,580 --> 02:23:14,950
John,

5684
02:23:14,950 --> 02:23:16,130
John [inaudible] Nah,

5685
02:23:16,480 --> 02:23:17,313
Nah.

5686
02:23:17,630 --> 02:23:19,740
[inaudible] her thing was,

5687
02:23:19,741 --> 02:23:22,490
I'm so much better than
beautiful front kick facer

5688
02:23:25,520 --> 02:23:26,353
and then uh,

5689
02:23:26,430 --> 02:23:30,600
she broke a couple of girls noses with
them at the heel striking down those and

5690
02:23:30,601 --> 02:23:30,960
uh,

5691
02:23:30,960 --> 02:23:31,261
yeah,

5692
02:23:31,261 --> 02:23:31,561
she,

5693
02:23:31,561 --> 02:23:31,980
she's,

5694
02:23:31,980 --> 02:23:32,730
she was um,

5695
02:23:32,730 --> 02:23:33,210
she's awesome.

5696
02:23:33,210 --> 02:23:34,940
My wife's really amazing fighting.

5697
02:23:35,410 --> 02:23:37,510
It's interesting because it ties,

5698
02:23:37,720 --> 02:23:41,860
use the teeth to the face almost like
the flat part of the foot more and almost

5699
02:23:41,861 --> 02:23:43,000
like a push kick.

5700
02:23:43,030 --> 02:23:43,470
Yes.

5701
02:23:43,470 --> 02:23:44,710
I like to push you back.

5702
02:23:44,980 --> 02:23:47,630
Very rarely would you see someone getting
actually knocked out from it that you

5703
02:23:47,631 --> 02:23:50,110
can see the head gets snapped but you
wouldn't see actually getting knocked out.

5704
02:23:50,111 --> 02:23:53,280
And so they don't throw it like
a karate style front kick night,

5705
02:23:53,320 --> 02:23:54,670
like a say like a semi shot.

5706
02:23:54,700 --> 02:23:56,080
Always used to throw it to the body.

5707
02:23:56,320 --> 02:23:57,420
He would throw it like a,

5708
02:23:57,480 --> 02:23:57,960
like a,

5709
02:23:57,960 --> 02:23:59,260
a thrust Kik,

5710
02:23:59,630 --> 02:24:00,910
different style of kicking.

5711
02:24:01,570 --> 02:24:03,700
Why the tires never threw it like that?

5712
02:24:03,701 --> 02:24:06,190
Because obviously when you're
watch Anderson versus [inaudible],

5713
02:24:06,550 --> 02:24:07,480
it's the same kick.

5714
02:24:07,481 --> 02:24:11,500
It's just done with a slightly
different style and it's very effective.

5715
02:24:11,560 --> 02:24:11,891
Yeah,

5716
02:24:11,891 --> 02:24:12,760
it was weird.

5717
02:24:12,761 --> 02:24:13,120
It was,

5718
02:24:13,120 --> 02:24:13,691
it was nuts.

5719
02:24:13,691 --> 02:24:17,640
And then a foreman shaded a to replicate
that same kick not long later on.

5720
02:24:17,650 --> 02:24:19,270
It was like damn these things.

5721
02:24:19,450 --> 02:24:21,250
That's pretty cool and never see it again.

5722
02:24:21,400 --> 02:24:24,580
I mean you see guys attempt it but
there's not been a single knockout.

5723
02:24:24,581 --> 02:24:27,970
And Justin Buckholtz got a
knockout I think in ring of fire.

5724
02:24:28,210 --> 02:24:29,200
I think that's where he fought,

5725
02:24:29,230 --> 02:24:30,130
which is um,

5726
02:24:30,450 --> 02:24:31,420
uh,

5727
02:24:31,510 --> 02:24:32,040
an organism.

5728
02:24:32,040 --> 02:24:34,600
Sven beans organization in Colorado.

5729
02:24:34,601 --> 02:24:35,680
I think that's where Justin,

5730
02:24:35,890 --> 02:24:36,990
he's one of the um,

5731
02:24:37,240 --> 02:24:38,073
Alpha Male,

5732
02:24:38,230 --> 02:24:38,650
uh,

5733
02:24:38,650 --> 02:24:39,760
Uriah Faber's camp,

5734
02:24:39,761 --> 02:24:41,080
one of the trainers there
and one of the fighters.

5735
02:24:41,230 --> 02:24:42,880
I can really think he's
a fight this weekend.

5736
02:24:42,881 --> 02:24:43,900
He might have fun this weekend.

5737
02:24:44,430 --> 02:24:45,100
Um,

5738
02:24:45,100 --> 02:24:49,630
but you very rarely see guys
knock guys out with it these days.

5739
02:24:49,631 --> 02:24:51,520
Like it was those two fights.

5740
02:24:51,550 --> 02:24:54,340
Justin's fight and I can't remember a,

5741
02:24:54,341 --> 02:24:56,290
another knockout since in the UFC.

5742
02:24:56,291 --> 02:24:57,124
People try it,

5743
02:24:57,760 --> 02:24:59,080
but it hasn't been a,

5744
02:24:59,490 --> 02:25:00,460
it been utilized,

5745
02:25:00,461 --> 02:25:01,120
uh,

5746
02:25:01,120 --> 02:25:01,953
as effectively.

5747
02:25:01,960 --> 02:25:02,860
What do you got there for me?

5748
02:25:03,610 --> 02:25:04,290
Ah,

5749
02:25:04,290 --> 02:25:05,123
there you are.

5750
02:25:05,500 --> 02:25:06,420
John Wayne par,

5751
02:25:06,421 --> 02:25:06,881
cosmo,

5752
02:25:06,881 --> 02:25:07,714
Xander,

5753
02:25:07,960 --> 02:25:08,650
Bam,

5754
02:25:08,650 --> 02:25:09,250
Tay.

5755
02:25:09,250 --> 02:25:10,360
Front kick to the face.

5756
02:25:10,630 --> 02:25:11,800
Hey,

5757
02:25:12,220 --> 02:25:12,791
what is that?

5758
02:25:12,791 --> 02:25:16,020
That thing that they always do
and when people throw kicks in,

5759
02:25:16,021 --> 02:25:17,680
I'm in Australia.

5760
02:25:18,670 --> 02:25:21,750
Well at a high five to
the face with your foot.

5761
02:25:22,020 --> 02:25:22,440
Oh,

5762
02:25:22,440 --> 02:25:22,990
okay.

5763
02:25:22,990 --> 02:25:23,860
That's a little awkward.

5764
02:25:24,720 --> 02:25:26,200
Trying to make something
a little more eloquent.

5765
02:25:26,930 --> 02:25:27,820
Come up with a better name.

5766
02:25:28,060 --> 02:25:29,320
Monster must like that though.

5767
02:25:29,350 --> 02:25:31,510
You go highlighted the m on your shorts.

5768
02:25:32,070 --> 02:25:32,903
Perfect.

5769
02:25:33,070 --> 02:25:34,450
That's a perfect picture for the wall.

5770
02:25:34,950 --> 02:25:35,520
Oh is,

5771
02:25:35,520 --> 02:25:39,490
I'm quite happy that cosmo was
quite enough to stand there for,

5772
02:25:39,550 --> 02:25:39,851
for me.

5773
02:25:39,851 --> 02:25:40,121
For the,

5774
02:25:40,121 --> 02:25:42,480
for the photo shoot to let me execute the,

5775
02:25:42,520 --> 02:25:45,630
Frankie did that one very nice
about what a gentleman he is.

5776
02:25:45,780 --> 02:25:48,880
What a gentlemen Instagram later on.

5777
02:25:48,881 --> 02:25:49,720
So everyone in get out.

5778
02:25:49,760 --> 02:25:51,470
So your fight for Cage Moy,

5779
02:25:51,471 --> 02:25:52,170
Tai,

5780
02:25:52,170 --> 02:25:52,750
um,

5781
02:25:52,750 --> 02:25:56,450
you guys are using the small
gloves and using the mortar gloss.

5782
02:25:56,480 --> 02:25:56,730
Is it,

5783
02:25:56,730 --> 02:26:01,730
are you the only organization that has
a full striking with more with Moitai

5784
02:26:02,080 --> 02:26:04,270
rules but with a MMA gloves?

5785
02:26:04,300 --> 02:26:05,051
I believe so.

5786
02:26:05,051 --> 02:26:05,950
And then a gentleman,

5787
02:26:06,010 --> 02:26:06,520
uh,

5788
02:26:06,520 --> 02:26:07,540
Martin Hogben,

5789
02:26:07,720 --> 02:26:09,370
a Hogan Hogan in,

5790
02:26:09,371 --> 02:26:09,860
um,

5791
02:26:09,860 --> 02:26:10,130
uh,

5792
02:26:10,130 --> 02:26:10,610
island.

5793
02:26:10,610 --> 02:26:11,090
He's,

5794
02:26:11,090 --> 02:26:13,300
he's seen my promotion.

5795
02:26:13,301 --> 02:26:14,560
Then he started it as well.

5796
02:26:14,830 --> 02:26:17,830
And then he's had done three shows
so far in Ireland and his last show,

5797
02:26:18,250 --> 02:26:19,120
Conor McGregor.

5798
02:26:19,150 --> 02:26:21,130
And uh,

5799
02:26:21,160 --> 02:26:22,870
what's the other gentleman
from Iceland that,

5800
02:26:23,340 --> 02:26:23,980
uh,

5801
02:26:23,980 --> 02:26:24,791
that flight's going to?

5802
02:26:24,791 --> 02:26:25,270
Nelson,

5803
02:26:25,270 --> 02:26:25,630
Ghana,

5804
02:26:25,630 --> 02:26:26,460
Ghana was there as well.

5805
02:26:26,460 --> 02:26:27,370
Nobody in the crowd.

5806
02:26:27,730 --> 02:26:30,010
And I think that both blown away by the,

5807
02:26:30,280 --> 02:26:34,060
the adrenaline of the cage because it's
so exciting and it's so fast and there's

5808
02:26:34,061 --> 02:26:36,760
no ground and then there's
no action on the fence.

5809
02:26:36,810 --> 02:26:37,960
I'm within five seconds.

5810
02:26:37,961 --> 02:26:38,591
It's broken up.

5811
02:26:38,591 --> 02:26:40,810
So it's just continuous violence.

5812
02:26:41,150 --> 02:26:44,290
So do you like the breaking
it up though with the clench?

5813
02:26:44,291 --> 02:26:45,400
Because in my tie,

5814
02:26:45,401 --> 02:26:45,791
you know,

5815
02:26:45,791 --> 02:26:47,320
in real Moitai they don't break it up.

5816
02:26:47,370 --> 02:26:47,710
Uh,

5817
02:26:47,710 --> 02:26:48,610
if there's an election,

5818
02:26:48,670 --> 02:26:52,030
so if you're throwing knees and it
becomes a stalemate within two or three

5819
02:26:52,031 --> 02:26:52,421
seconds,

5820
02:26:52,421 --> 02:26:54,490
if there's no action that
they break it straight away.

5821
02:26:54,760 --> 02:26:56,980
Whereas if there's no
actual or is in a MMA,

5822
02:26:56,981 --> 02:26:59,950
you can press something and gets
the free hold onto them and hold,

5823
02:26:59,951 --> 02:27:00,221
hold,

5824
02:27:00,221 --> 02:27:00,490
hold.

5825
02:27:00,490 --> 02:27:00,830
On.

5826
02:27:00,830 --> 02:27:01,341
The UFC,

5827
02:27:01,341 --> 02:27:04,750
they usually will stop it
and the separate eventually.

5828
02:27:05,200 --> 02:27:09,820
I honestly believe that especially in
MMA since grappling such an integral part

5829
02:27:09,821 --> 02:27:10,870
of mixed martial arts,

5830
02:27:10,871 --> 02:27:12,490
I don't think they should
ever break things up.

5831
02:27:12,910 --> 02:27:16,090
I think if a guy's got you down
and he's just holding you down,

5832
02:27:16,120 --> 02:27:16,900
that's tough shit.

5833
02:27:16,900 --> 02:27:18,070
You got to figure out how to get up.

5834
02:27:18,340 --> 02:27:20,890
I don't think it should score
very well for the guy on top,

5835
02:27:20,891 --> 02:27:21,701
but I really don't.

5836
02:27:21,701 --> 02:27:26,110
I don't believe in stand ups cause I
feel like especially for a striker,

5837
02:27:26,140 --> 02:27:26,680
right,

5838
02:27:26,680 --> 02:27:30,010
you have five minutes and
every round starts standing up.

5839
02:27:30,190 --> 02:27:32,200
Everyone starts with your advantage.

5840
02:27:32,380 --> 02:27:33,910
No round starts on the ground.

5841
02:27:34,090 --> 02:27:36,520
You'd never start where
like okay this round John,

5842
02:27:36,521 --> 02:27:37,360
you're on top.

5843
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:39,040
You know you started on
top cause he was like,

5844
02:27:39,041 --> 02:27:39,251
no.

5845
02:27:39,251 --> 02:27:43,050
But every round starts standing up and
that's the advantage of the striker.

5846
02:27:43,050 --> 02:27:43,280
This,

5847
02:27:43,280 --> 02:27:45,160
the grappler has to figure
out how to get ahold of them,

5848
02:27:45,161 --> 02:27:45,994
how to get them to the ground.

5849
02:27:46,210 --> 02:27:47,380
I think once you've done that,

5850
02:27:47,410 --> 02:27:49,270
it's the guy on the grounds business.

5851
02:27:49,271 --> 02:27:50,140
Try to get back up.

5852
02:27:50,990 --> 02:27:52,120
It's fucking boring.

5853
02:27:52,121 --> 02:27:52,870
You're good.

5854
02:27:52,870 --> 02:27:53,291
You like,

5855
02:27:53,291 --> 02:27:54,280
we're fucking guys,

5856
02:27:54,281 --> 02:27:55,030
Bro.

5857
02:27:55,030 --> 02:27:57,310
I'm just saying there's only five minutes.

5858
02:27:57,460 --> 02:27:57,881
Okay,

5859
02:27:57,881 --> 02:27:58,930
and for grappling,

5860
02:27:59,110 --> 02:28:00,310
five minutes is not that long.

5861
02:28:00,530 --> 02:28:00,800
You,

5862
02:28:00,800 --> 02:28:01,300
if you,

5863
02:28:01,300 --> 02:28:01,991
if he say,

5864
02:28:01,991 --> 02:28:06,310
if you were grappling with another guy
who was also at your level in grappling

5865
02:28:06,610 --> 02:28:09,340
and you guys were
tangling for five minutes,

5866
02:28:09,970 --> 02:28:14,170
if you're both at the same level is going
to be a lot of stalemates and it takes

5867
02:28:14,230 --> 02:28:19,230
little incremental improvements
and advances for you to
get to a position where

5868
02:28:19,751 --> 02:28:21,950
you finally get to a mount
or you finally get an Armbar,

5869
02:28:21,980 --> 02:28:22,910
you finally get a choke.

5870
02:28:23,390 --> 02:28:27,080
It's hard to do and you can't do it if
you keep standing people up when they

5871
02:28:27,081 --> 02:28:27,914
stale mate,

5872
02:28:28,010 --> 02:28:30,530
because that's stalemates
apart of grappling.

5873
02:28:30,860 --> 02:28:34,490
It's like it's your job to figure
out if you're on the bottom,

5874
02:28:34,610 --> 02:28:36,470
how to get up or how to
submit him from your back.

5875
02:28:36,650 --> 02:28:40,490
It's the guy's job on the top to hold
you down and to figure out how to get you

5876
02:28:40,491 --> 02:28:43,340
in a better position and to dominate
you and to figure out how to submit you.

5877
02:28:43,650 --> 02:28:45,350
But son of time,

5878
02:28:45,470 --> 02:28:46,820
five minutes is not enough time.

5879
02:28:47,060 --> 02:28:47,730
Yeah.

5880
02:28:47,730 --> 02:28:50,870
The same with the pressed against the
fence when sometimes then they stuck there

5881
02:28:50,871 --> 02:28:53,600
for for more than two minutes.

5882
02:28:53,890 --> 02:28:56,600
And when the guys get impatient
than they make mistakes.

5883
02:28:56,900 --> 02:28:59,870
Like if a guy's pressing you up against
the cage and he's knee and your legs and

5884
02:28:59,871 --> 02:29:00,411
he's hitting,

5885
02:29:00,411 --> 02:29:03,530
he was short elbows and you're just
waiting for the referees to separate.

5886
02:29:03,531 --> 02:29:04,820
If the referee doesn't separate,

5887
02:29:05,030 --> 02:29:07,280
you might do something silly,

5888
02:29:07,430 --> 02:29:08,600
you might make a mistake,

5889
02:29:08,720 --> 02:29:09,050
you might.

5890
02:29:09,050 --> 02:29:09,950
And that's what they're trying to do.

5891
02:29:09,951 --> 02:29:11,720
Like Randy coture was the master at that,

5892
02:29:11,990 --> 02:29:13,760
at a holding guys up against the cage,

5893
02:29:13,761 --> 02:29:15,020
but he didn't get it.

5894
02:29:15,050 --> 02:29:17,780
They didn't separate him very often
because he was constantly moving.

5895
02:29:17,960 --> 02:29:19,160
He'd be constantly punching.

5896
02:29:19,161 --> 02:29:21,500
You constantly need your
body needing your legs.

5897
02:29:21,680 --> 02:29:25,100
He was working you and he was
pushing on you and wearing you out.

5898
02:29:25,250 --> 02:29:28,430
That was a big part of his
strategy and I just feel like,

5899
02:29:28,431 --> 02:29:29,080
um,

5900
02:29:29,080 --> 02:29:34,080
you know with MMA they're trying really
hard to make it more fan friendly and

5901
02:29:34,401 --> 02:29:38,150
they're trying really hard to make the
action like more exciting to watch.

5902
02:29:38,151 --> 02:29:42,560
But I think in doing so your water down
the art a little bit and there's an art

5903
02:29:42,740 --> 02:29:46,740
with two guys trying to figure
out what to do to each other to,

5904
02:29:46,760 --> 02:29:50,090
to defend and to attack
and figure out who can win.

5905
02:29:50,210 --> 02:29:51,043
Yep.

5906
02:29:51,320 --> 02:29:51,591
I don't know,

5907
02:29:51,591 --> 02:29:52,550
that's just my feeling.

5908
02:29:52,640 --> 02:29:55,250
But I think if you're going
to have pure stand up,

5909
02:29:55,400 --> 02:29:56,780
just pure stand up striking,

5910
02:29:57,170 --> 02:29:59,750
I think what you're doing
is the best way to do it.

5911
02:29:59,900 --> 02:30:04,490
I think small gloves and I think
doing it in a cage and where,

5912
02:30:04,491 --> 02:30:04,731
you know,

5913
02:30:04,731 --> 02:30:06,440
you don't have to worry about
guys falling through the ropes.

5914
02:30:06,790 --> 02:30:08,630
Like I've seen that in a lot of events,

5915
02:30:08,631 --> 02:30:11,780
especially when guys start clenching and
they get up against the rope and maybe

5916
02:30:11,781 --> 02:30:13,640
their buck goes through like two ropes.

5917
02:30:13,690 --> 02:30:17,270
They slid back or maybe the duck and away
from a punch and they wind up falling

5918
02:30:17,271 --> 02:30:17,960
out of the ropes.

5919
02:30:17,960 --> 02:30:18,980
It happens too much.

5920
02:30:19,020 --> 02:30:19,201
Yeah,

5921
02:30:19,201 --> 02:30:20,630
I've seen 'em how's it a,

5922
02:30:20,631 --> 02:30:21,350
a local,

5923
02:30:21,350 --> 02:30:21,640
uh,

5924
02:30:21,640 --> 02:30:23,520
my two I show in the ring and the head,

5925
02:30:23,521 --> 02:30:23,910
uh,

5926
02:30:23,910 --> 02:30:26,490
two gentlemen Clinton
away and the other guys,

5927
02:30:26,660 --> 02:30:27,050
uh,

5928
02:30:27,050 --> 02:30:28,500
the full on straight through the center.

5929
02:30:29,010 --> 02:30:33,930
And then they had the judges' table right
beside the ring and they had all the

5930
02:30:33,931 --> 02:30:38,760
trophies lined up and it was those
trophies where the angel was on top of the

5931
02:30:38,761 --> 02:30:40,440
trophy with the hands clasped together.

5932
02:30:40,800 --> 02:30:41,431
And it was a,

5933
02:30:41,431 --> 02:30:41,791
it was,

5934
02:30:41,791 --> 02:30:42,120
uh,

5935
02:30:42,120 --> 02:30:47,120
like raises and the guy's
head miss the trophy by,

5936
02:30:48,090 --> 02:30:50,340
by inches and it flopped onto the desk.

5937
02:30:50,341 --> 02:30:52,530
And if it had been a
little bit to the left,

5938
02:30:52,531 --> 02:30:54,570
he would add piece straight threes.

5939
02:30:54,571 --> 02:30:59,490
I would have been detrimental for fuck
would they have sharp objects right next

5940
02:30:59,491 --> 02:31:00,070
to the rings.

5941
02:31:00,070 --> 02:31:02,880
Hey guys are throwing each other
around town would have been horrific.

5942
02:31:03,030 --> 02:31:04,520
It was definitely seeking say,

5943
02:31:04,530 --> 02:31:04,770
oh,

5944
02:31:04,770 --> 02:31:07,560
always made sure with Ashley's
now I trophies or under the table,

5945
02:31:07,561 --> 02:31:08,730
but that was a learning curve.

5946
02:31:08,800 --> 02:31:09,770
Bernard Hopkins,

5947
02:31:10,680 --> 02:31:11,150
well known,

5948
02:31:11,150 --> 02:31:11,850
he didn't fall,

5949
02:31:11,850 --> 02:31:12,630
he didn't fall,

5950
02:31:12,630 --> 02:31:14,610
he fell and broke my shoulder.

5951
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:15,630
Um,

5952
02:31:15,630 --> 02:31:16,890
but within the cage,

5953
02:31:16,920 --> 02:31:17,370
um,

5954
02:31:17,370 --> 02:31:18,570
from a personal experience,

5955
02:31:18,571 --> 02:31:20,360
I've had a and s

5956
02:31:20,610 --> 02:31:21,301
18,

5957
02:31:21,301 --> 02:31:22,530
19 fights in the ring,

5958
02:31:22,700 --> 02:31:24,330
but to be locked in that cage,

5959
02:31:24,331 --> 02:31:25,530
it as a,

5960
02:31:25,620 --> 02:31:26,640
not as a spectator,

5961
02:31:26,641 --> 02:31:27,510
but as a fighter,

5962
02:31:27,750 --> 02:31:31,100
it's such a different
atmosphere in a different arena.

5963
02:31:31,540 --> 02:31:31,860
Um,

5964
02:31:31,860 --> 02:31:34,230
it definitely brings out a
completely different beast.

5965
02:31:34,231 --> 02:31:35,610
And then when you know
your opponents were,

5966
02:31:35,611 --> 02:31:36,444
and those little gloves,

5967
02:31:36,780 --> 02:31:37,500
um,

5968
02:31:37,500 --> 02:31:37,891
yeah,

5969
02:31:37,891 --> 02:31:42,130
every single sensor in your bodies
is tingling because you know,

5970
02:31:42,131 --> 02:31:46,680
if you make a mistake you're going to
be completely dominated or wiped out or

5971
02:31:47,010 --> 02:31:47,650
uh,

5972
02:31:47,650 --> 02:31:51,780
not the end knocked unconscious or
it's about bare knuckle ban a whole,

5973
02:31:51,781 --> 02:31:53,720
I haven't tried it in um,

5974
02:31:54,380 --> 02:31:55,770
sounds very painful.

5975
02:31:56,820 --> 02:31:58,410
And then cause my hands too,

5976
02:31:58,411 --> 02:32:01,770
I think the idea of smacking someone in
the forehead with being a who wouldn't

5977
02:32:01,771 --> 02:32:03,960
be healthy for my longevity.

5978
02:32:04,440 --> 02:32:07,890
So I like the idea with having him reps
and having the small gloves and having

5979
02:32:07,891 --> 02:32:09,080
the quick cause with my mom,

5980
02:32:09,100 --> 02:32:10,110
a CMC gloves,

5981
02:32:10,380 --> 02:32:10,710
uh,

5982
02:32:10,710 --> 02:32:11,640
it's half,

5983
02:32:11,640 --> 02:32:11,881
half padding,

5984
02:32:11,881 --> 02:32:12,714
half Joe,

5985
02:32:12,750 --> 02:32:13,411
so it's in,

5986
02:32:13,411 --> 02:32:15,150
it's almost a six ounce instead of a four.

5987
02:32:15,420 --> 02:32:17,490
So it's not like a complete them,

5988
02:32:17,550 --> 02:32:19,710
but it's still fingerless you design them.

5989
02:32:19,810 --> 02:32:22,350
I had them talked with
a company in Australia.

5990
02:32:22,351 --> 02:32:25,710
They helped design it and make them
pick up because I work as a promoter.

5991
02:32:25,890 --> 02:32:27,840
I didn't want to have
someone dying on my show.

5992
02:32:28,110 --> 02:32:28,950
So I made a,

5993
02:32:28,980 --> 02:32:32,760
I made it a thicker padding
because there's no taking down.

5994
02:32:32,761 --> 02:32:33,594
There's no holding.

5995
02:32:33,900 --> 02:32:37,500
It's just a complete trauma
for four or five rounds.

5996
02:32:37,890 --> 02:32:38,231
So,

5997
02:32:38,231 --> 02:32:38,580
um,

5998
02:32:38,580 --> 02:32:39,840
well the argument is,

5999
02:32:40,030 --> 02:32:41,760
I mean I see what your point is,

6000
02:32:41,761 --> 02:32:42,870
but the argument is that,

6001
02:32:43,220 --> 02:32:43,500
you know,

6002
02:32:43,500 --> 02:32:46,050
you're saying you wouldn't want to
break your hands on someone's forehead.

6003
02:32:46,051 --> 02:32:50,820
The argument is that you could
throw it Shin kick with full power.

6004
02:32:50,821 --> 02:32:51,541
So Shin,

6005
02:32:51,541 --> 02:32:54,090
which is much more powerful
than a punch Shin to the head,

6006
02:32:54,091 --> 02:32:55,110
right knee to the head,

6007
02:32:55,170 --> 02:32:56,010
elbows to the head.

6008
02:32:56,040 --> 02:32:56,400
Yes.

6009
02:32:56,400 --> 02:33:01,400
Why do you allow someone to tape up
their wrist and form an unnatural bond?

6010
02:33:01,590 --> 02:33:01,921
Right?

6011
02:33:01,921 --> 02:33:05,760
And then tape up their hands and make
it nice and hard so he can punch full

6012
02:33:05,761 --> 02:33:06,594
blast.

6013
02:33:06,630 --> 02:33:11,630
Whereas the reality is the hands should
be used judiciously because there's not

6014
02:33:12,061 --> 02:33:13,710
a lot of room for error.

6015
02:33:13,830 --> 02:33:16,320
If you do make a mistake and you punched
full blast and you hit someone in an

6016
02:33:16,321 --> 02:33:16,860
elbow,

6017
02:33:16,860 --> 02:33:19,080
they cover up like that and your
knuckle slamming in the elbow,

6018
02:33:19,230 --> 02:33:20,250
you might shatter your hand.

6019
02:33:20,330 --> 02:33:22,020
You might shatter your
hand on their forehead,

6020
02:33:22,170 --> 02:33:25,800
you might shatter your in your hand a
lot of different ways and you have to be

6021
02:33:25,801 --> 02:33:30,600
way more clean with your strikes and it
makes it more realistic and they think a

6022
02:33:30,601 --> 02:33:33,990
lot of people think that that would
actually alleviate a lot of the brain

6023
02:33:33,991 --> 02:33:34,824
damage.

6024
02:33:35,550 --> 02:33:36,210
Okay.

6025
02:33:36,210 --> 02:33:37,043
What do you,

6026
02:33:37,350 --> 02:33:38,190
what do you think of that?

6027
02:33:38,220 --> 02:33:38,640
Ah,

6028
02:33:38,640 --> 02:33:38,911
yeah,

6029
02:33:38,911 --> 02:33:40,830
just the way my hands are always sorta.

6030
02:33:41,040 --> 02:33:43,170
I've had a little bit of
difficulties in the past with them,

6031
02:33:43,171 --> 02:33:43,980
so that's nice.

6032
02:33:43,980 --> 02:33:44,813
That's nice.

6033
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:45,950
It's reassuring.

6034
02:33:46,260 --> 02:33:47,490
When I had the hammer it was on that,

6035
02:33:47,491 --> 02:33:48,720
that's keeping my wrist into a,

6036
02:33:48,721 --> 02:33:50,580
a noise from a place.

6037
02:33:50,610 --> 02:33:51,061
So when I,

6038
02:33:51,061 --> 02:33:53,520
when I punch wrong that I'm
just not going to break my hand.

6039
02:33:53,760 --> 02:33:54,031
Okay.

6040
02:33:54,031 --> 02:33:56,370
But it just having that cushioning at
the top of the knuckles because the

6041
02:33:56,371 --> 02:33:58,050
knuckles are so sensitive that,

6042
02:33:58,051 --> 02:33:58,530
um,

6043
02:33:58,530 --> 02:34:00,150
I've broken them before so,

6044
02:34:00,590 --> 02:34:01,420
uh,

6045
02:34:01,420 --> 02:34:01,770
it,

6046
02:34:01,770 --> 02:34:02,603
it just,

6047
02:34:02,620 --> 02:34:04,900
and I know why my hands
are wrapped properly,

6048
02:34:04,901 --> 02:34:07,680
then I can hit it with full force
and not have any repercussions.

6049
02:34:07,830 --> 02:34:09,120
Does that argument make sense to you?

6050
02:34:09,121 --> 02:34:09,601
That it does?

6051
02:34:09,601 --> 02:34:09,961
It does,

6052
02:34:09,961 --> 02:34:11,940
but I think it'd be more open hearted.

6053
02:34:12,120 --> 02:34:15,870
Open hand slaps us Rutan
and that time Chris,

6054
02:34:15,930 --> 02:34:18,130
yes he stole was pretty

6055
02:34:18,160 --> 02:34:18,993
insane.

6056
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:19,490
The Ida,

6057
02:34:19,490 --> 02:34:20,261
the you definitely,

6058
02:34:20,261 --> 02:34:21,400
you wouldn't want to
punch with their clothes.

6059
02:34:21,401 --> 02:34:21,760
Fishy.

6060
02:34:21,760 --> 02:34:23,590
Definitely be one of the arm to the body.

6061
02:34:23,591 --> 02:34:28,591
Maybe you would right hire five someone's
face with your palm and then you have

6062
02:34:28,661 --> 02:34:32,080
a lot of high pokes and so
that's a real issue with MMA.

6063
02:34:32,110 --> 02:34:32,860
Yes.

6064
02:34:32,860 --> 02:34:35,540
Even when cmts had
haven't few punches will.

6065
02:34:35,590 --> 02:34:36,880
So yeah man,

6066
02:34:36,881 --> 02:34:40,630
I wish they figured something
out to fix that drives me nicely.

6067
02:34:40,750 --> 02:34:41,111
Danger.

6068
02:34:41,111 --> 02:34:43,150
What I'm doing with the CMT gloves is a,

6069
02:34:43,151 --> 02:34:45,160
with the fingerless because they
had a lot of people were saying,

6070
02:34:45,161 --> 02:34:46,540
well why are you doing it?

6071
02:34:46,541 --> 02:34:48,640
There's so many problems
with the UFC and the police.

6072
02:34:48,641 --> 02:34:51,130
Where do you want to bring
that same element into the
what you're doing with the

6073
02:34:51,131 --> 02:34:51,850
cage,

6074
02:34:51,850 --> 02:34:55,120
but at the same time if you wear
boxing gloves in the in the cage,

6075
02:34:55,121 --> 02:34:55,840
it just looks,

6076
02:34:55,840 --> 02:34:57,190
looks so dumb.

6077
02:34:57,190 --> 02:34:58,023
It looks,

6078
02:34:58,290 --> 02:35:02,680
it does because you had your spent every
single weekend watching UFC and then

6079
02:35:02,681 --> 02:35:05,700
you're trying to get the same respect
from the MMA fans for what you're doing

6080
02:35:05,720 --> 02:35:10,660
and what we're in the w with Kate most
high rules and you've got these big

6081
02:35:10,661 --> 02:35:13,030
pillows on yet the UFC
guys were in the thing,

6082
02:35:13,040 --> 02:35:16,840
those ones or is it possible that you
could do something that's not fingerless

6083
02:35:16,841 --> 02:35:19,300
but it's also very light that
it looks like a bad glove?

6084
02:35:19,840 --> 02:35:20,673
You know,

6085
02:35:20,760 --> 02:35:21,593
it's the visual.

6086
02:35:22,070 --> 02:35:24,750
I think it's the visual
that cells and and uh,

6087
02:35:24,840 --> 02:35:25,840
as a fighter as well.

6088
02:35:25,841 --> 02:35:28,960
I know when I put them on
I feel like I'm a warrior.

6089
02:35:30,040 --> 02:35:32,140
It's a weird thing to try and explain,

6090
02:35:32,141 --> 02:35:32,741
but it's just,

6091
02:35:32,741 --> 02:35:33,040
um,

6092
02:35:33,040 --> 02:35:34,830
I know that when I close my fist and I,

6093
02:35:34,831 --> 02:35:35,770
and then when I clench,

6094
02:35:35,800 --> 02:35:37,500
I know that I have my
fingers and I can catch the,

6095
02:35:37,680 --> 02:35:40,960
the kicks a lot it and manipulate the
guard so I can throw elbows easier as

6096
02:35:40,961 --> 02:35:41,740
well.

6097
02:35:41,740 --> 02:35:42,760
So it's um,

6098
02:35:43,120 --> 02:35:45,070
you also read a different
element of finding.

6099
02:35:45,071 --> 02:35:45,251
I've,

6100
02:35:45,251 --> 02:35:46,240
I've had so many fights,

6101
02:35:46,480 --> 02:35:49,900
gloves and then you put these little
things on and then the bell rings and then

6102
02:35:49,901 --> 02:35:50,530
I feel,

6103
02:35:50,530 --> 02:35:52,540
I feel free because when I'm training,

6104
02:35:52,570 --> 02:35:54,730
I trained for 10 weeks with no gloves.

6105
02:35:54,731 --> 02:35:55,331
When I'm clinching,

6106
02:35:55,331 --> 02:35:59,440
I train when I play spar with the kicks
and then when all of a sudden I'm a

6107
02:35:59,441 --> 02:35:59,771
strictly,

6108
02:35:59,771 --> 02:36:01,810
when I put boxing gloves
on and then I'm not,

6109
02:36:02,020 --> 02:36:06,310
I can't execute the same game plan when
I'm training to win on fighting if it,

6110
02:36:06,340 --> 02:36:07,210
does that make sense?

6111
02:36:07,460 --> 02:36:08,291
It doesn't make sense,

6112
02:36:08,291 --> 02:36:10,300
but why wouldn't you just
train with the gloves,

6113
02:36:12,850 --> 02:36:14,140
the boxing gloves,

6114
02:36:15,100 --> 02:36:15,933
uh,

6115
02:36:18,490 --> 02:36:18,850
in,

6116
02:36:18,850 --> 02:36:19,060
in,

6117
02:36:19,060 --> 02:36:19,331
in the,

6118
02:36:19,331 --> 02:36:20,164
in the cage,

6119
02:36:20,350 --> 02:36:21,310
in the cages.

6120
02:36:21,340 --> 02:36:21,611
Just,

6121
02:36:21,611 --> 02:36:22,300
um,

6122
02:36:22,300 --> 02:36:23,320
I see your point.

6123
02:36:23,440 --> 02:36:24,273
You're not looking right.

6124
02:36:25,110 --> 02:36:25,943
I see your point.

6125
02:36:26,200 --> 02:36:26,980
Yeah.

6126
02:36:26,980 --> 02:36:27,670
I want,

6127
02:36:27,670 --> 02:36:30,790
I want the MMA people to
look at my promotion and say,

6128
02:36:30,791 --> 02:36:31,000
yeah,

6129
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:31,391
fuck yeah,

6130
02:36:31,391 --> 02:36:32,224
that's cool.

6131
02:36:32,410 --> 02:36:32,851
It's wall.

6132
02:36:32,851 --> 02:36:34,960
It's everything that they want out of MMA.

6133
02:36:35,020 --> 02:36:35,590
Yes.

6134
02:36:35,590 --> 02:36:37,630
That especially people that
don't like the ground game,

6135
02:36:37,660 --> 02:36:38,530
it's everything they want.

6136
02:36:38,730 --> 02:36:39,030
Wild,

6137
02:36:39,030 --> 02:36:39,370
crazy.

6138
02:36:39,370 --> 02:36:40,570
Still not going to get their respect.

6139
02:36:40,571 --> 02:36:41,500
If I wear boxing gloves,

6140
02:36:41,530 --> 02:36:42,820
I need to make it this,

6141
02:36:42,980 --> 02:36:45,520
the same environment
with everything the same,

6142
02:36:45,730 --> 02:36:46,840
just eliminate the ground.

6143
02:36:46,841 --> 02:36:48,220
So there was strikers have a,

6144
02:36:48,630 --> 02:36:52,530
a platform node to fight in that
same arena because of so many gods.

6145
02:36:52,531 --> 02:36:55,390
So I get so many emails from people that
want to fight on the show because they

6146
02:36:55,391 --> 02:36:55,720
want to,

6147
02:36:55,720 --> 02:36:57,250
they want to feel that Russia the cage,

6148
02:36:57,251 --> 02:36:58,750
they want to feel that rush at MMA gloves.

6149
02:36:59,050 --> 02:36:59,381
But there's,

6150
02:36:59,381 --> 02:37:01,230
there's no platform platform for,

6151
02:37:01,290 --> 02:37:01,430
to,

6152
02:37:01,430 --> 02:37:01,631
to,

6153
02:37:01,631 --> 02:37:02,140
uh,

6154
02:37:02,140 --> 02:37:02,320
to,

6155
02:37:02,320 --> 02:37:03,430
to do it besides mine.

6156
02:37:04,360 --> 02:37:05,420
So yeah,

6157
02:37:06,280 --> 02:37:07,113
it's um,

6158
02:37:07,250 --> 02:37:07,620
it's,

6159
02:37:07,620 --> 02:37:10,150
it's an interesting sort of a transition.

6160
02:37:10,390 --> 02:37:13,660
It's like the gladiator days where
you're fighting in the coliseum.

6161
02:37:14,050 --> 02:37:15,010
Don't they do that in?

6162
02:37:15,620 --> 02:37:16,040
They do like

6163
02:37:16,040 --> 02:37:17,330
one what they wrap the hands.

6164
02:37:17,331 --> 02:37:19,280
They all do like big crazy hand wraps.

6165
02:37:19,281 --> 02:37:19,551
Yes.

6166
02:37:19,551 --> 02:37:19,771
They,

6167
02:37:19,771 --> 02:37:19,981
they,

6168
02:37:19,981 --> 02:37:21,500
they've just had of that
in the last few years.

6169
02:37:21,501 --> 02:37:22,220
Also,

6170
02:37:22,220 --> 02:37:23,060
typhoid is called,

6171
02:37:23,410 --> 02:37:23,691
uh,

6172
02:37:23,691 --> 02:37:25,790
the same deal with the hand reps as well.

6173
02:37:25,791 --> 02:37:26,420
And the,

6174
02:37:26,420 --> 02:37:29,810
but a sinner rings still say you said
a ring and they have a big giant hand

6175
02:37:29,811 --> 02:37:30,230
wraps.

6176
02:37:30,230 --> 02:37:31,580
They're not totally,

6177
02:37:32,190 --> 02:37:33,080
yeah,

6178
02:37:33,410 --> 02:37:34,750
I've heard rumors that there,

6179
02:37:34,800 --> 02:37:36,830
there may or may not be an MMA glove,

6180
02:37:36,860 --> 02:37:41,860
similar sort of stall underneath or if
it's a softer cotton or it's not like

6181
02:37:41,960 --> 02:37:43,480
pure big.

6182
02:37:43,540 --> 02:37:43,701
Yeah,

6183
02:37:43,701 --> 02:37:44,440
it's big.

6184
02:37:44,440 --> 02:37:45,620
Those are big hand wraps.

6185
02:37:45,621 --> 02:37:48,860
It's not like as simple as
like the regular wrap that
you would wear when you're

6186
02:37:48,861 --> 02:37:49,460
boxing.

6187
02:37:49,460 --> 02:37:49,701
Yeah.

6188
02:37:49,701 --> 02:37:50,720
And it's on the calendar go out.

6189
02:37:50,830 --> 02:37:51,021
No,

6190
02:37:51,021 --> 02:37:51,854
it's not an aesthetic.

6191
02:37:52,010 --> 02:37:54,410
Do you think how the cage
is a big selling element?

6192
02:37:54,450 --> 02:37:55,070
Um,

6193
02:37:55,070 --> 02:37:57,200
I know when I walk into
arena and I see a ring,

6194
02:37:57,410 --> 02:37:57,800
it's like,

6195
02:37:57,800 --> 02:37:58,490
Yay,

6196
02:37:58,490 --> 02:37:59,110
the flight's tonight.

6197
02:37:59,110 --> 02:37:59,550
You beauty.

6198
02:37:59,550 --> 02:38:00,380
I'm excited.

6199
02:38:00,380 --> 02:38:03,110
I walk into arena and I
see a cage and it's like,

6200
02:38:03,260 --> 02:38:04,390
oh she's,

6201
02:38:04,391 --> 02:38:05,870
someone's going to get fucked up tonight.

6202
02:38:06,890 --> 02:38:07,723
It's gonna be,

6203
02:38:07,810 --> 02:38:08,330
it's,

6204
02:38:08,330 --> 02:38:08,900
it's,

6205
02:38:08,900 --> 02:38:09,410
it's,

6206
02:38:09,410 --> 02:38:10,280
it's a different base.

6207
02:38:10,281 --> 02:38:10,661
You're walking.

6208
02:38:10,661 --> 02:38:11,091
Did I read it?

6209
02:38:11,091 --> 02:38:11,721
And it's a different,

6210
02:38:11,721 --> 02:38:12,650
it's a different animal.

6211
02:38:13,280 --> 02:38:16,010
It's funny to see that because that was
always like a thing that people thought

6212
02:38:16,011 --> 02:38:19,670
was holding him and me back examine may
was in a cage and people didn't like the

6213
02:38:19,671 --> 02:38:21,500
idea of cage fighting in quotes,

6214
02:38:21,501 --> 02:38:22,600
cage fighting it.

6215
02:38:22,630 --> 02:38:24,500
Now it's $1 billion business.

6216
02:38:24,530 --> 02:38:25,250
It's well,

6217
02:38:25,250 --> 02:38:26,990
UFC UFC is not MMA.

6218
02:38:27,950 --> 02:38:28,671
UFC,

6219
02:38:28,671 --> 02:38:31,700
you know there was an article that was
recently out about the world series of

6220
02:38:31,701 --> 02:38:32,151
fighting,

6221
02:38:32,151 --> 02:38:35,480
which has some really good fighters
in the world series of fighting.

6222
02:38:35,810 --> 02:38:36,621
You know there's some,

6223
02:38:36,621 --> 02:38:40,160
there's some super high level guys
in in the world series of fighting.

6224
02:38:40,161 --> 02:38:44,150
You watch some real good fights
and they're not making any money.

6225
02:38:44,180 --> 02:38:44,991
They're losing money.

6226
02:38:44,991 --> 02:38:46,340
They're on NBC sports,

6227
02:38:46,400 --> 02:38:46,761
you know,

6228
02:38:46,761 --> 02:38:48,680
and I don't know how much
NBC sports pays them,

6229
02:38:48,681 --> 02:38:52,400
but it was some article on the underground
about them losing money and being in

6230
02:38:52,401 --> 02:38:52,850
dire,

6231
02:38:52,850 --> 02:38:54,200
dire financial straits.

6232
02:38:54,560 --> 02:38:55,760
And for me as a fan,

6233
02:38:56,330 --> 02:38:59,780
I hate hearing that because I want guys
to have options because when guys get

6234
02:38:59,781 --> 02:39:00,890
cut from the UFC,

6235
02:39:01,100 --> 02:39:03,650
a lot of times they'll go to world
tour as a fighting one of these other

6236
02:39:03,651 --> 02:39:06,620
organizations like Jake shields
or John Fitch and you know,

6237
02:39:06,621 --> 02:39:09,410
they're build up when a few fights over
there and maybe they can come back to

6238
02:39:09,411 --> 02:39:09,921
the UFC.

6239
02:39:09,921 --> 02:39:11,180
And I like hearing that.

6240
02:39:11,181 --> 02:39:11,630
I want,

6241
02:39:11,630 --> 02:39:12,463
I want to see that.

6242
02:39:12,560 --> 02:39:14,540
That's what happened to
our Lawsky Anthony Johnson,

6243
02:39:14,690 --> 02:39:15,520
Anthony Johnson,

6244
02:39:15,520 --> 02:39:17,360
he fought Arlovski in the
world series of fighting.

6245
02:39:17,420 --> 02:39:18,170
Yes.

6246
02:39:18,170 --> 02:39:19,030
I like that.

6247
02:39:19,290 --> 02:39:23,180
I that has to be available and it can't
be available if these guys aren't making

6248
02:39:23,181 --> 02:39:23,570
any money.

6249
02:39:23,570 --> 02:39:25,900
It's the same in Australia that the eye,

6250
02:39:26,240 --> 02:39:28,220
I love UFC.

6251
02:39:28,280 --> 02:39:29,031
I love it.

6252
02:39:29,031 --> 02:39:30,620
I'm there every single weekend.

6253
02:39:30,621 --> 02:39:31,730
I'm balling a little paper views.

6254
02:39:31,731 --> 02:39:32,780
I'm watching all the replays.

6255
02:39:32,820 --> 02:39:34,330
I love your commentary.

6256
02:39:34,680 --> 02:39:35,240
Uh,

6257
02:39:35,240 --> 02:39:37,070
I love every single thing about it.

6258
02:39:37,340 --> 02:39:41,690
And then I go to a local MMA
show and I'm bored shitless.

6259
02:39:42,040 --> 02:39:42,560
Uh,

6260
02:39:42,560 --> 02:39:44,830
they got two guys that are in it.

6261
02:39:44,840 --> 02:39:45,561
It's in Australia too,

6262
02:39:45,561 --> 02:39:46,280
cause we didn't wrestle.

6263
02:39:46,280 --> 02:39:47,970
Said say within 10 seconds,

6264
02:39:47,971 --> 02:39:50,750
they're both on the ground and they
don't have the skillset to stand back up.

6265
02:39:50,751 --> 02:39:52,460
And they sort of get
stuck for five minutes.

6266
02:39:53,390 --> 02:39:53,950
But wait,

6267
02:39:53,950 --> 02:39:54,950
when you watch UFC there,

6268
02:39:54,960 --> 02:39:56,160
it's such a high level that it's,

6269
02:39:56,161 --> 02:39:57,370
it's like two worms.

6270
02:39:57,371 --> 02:39:58,400
The next minute they're up again.

6271
02:39:58,401 --> 02:40:00,110
They're down the Jujitsu.

6272
02:40:00,160 --> 02:40:00,891
So crazy.

6273
02:40:00,891 --> 02:40:01,461
The striking.

6274
02:40:01,461 --> 02:40:02,241
So amazing.

6275
02:40:02,241 --> 02:40:03,980
You've got the Surooney's and it's,

6276
02:40:03,981 --> 02:40:04,311
it's,

6277
02:40:04,311 --> 02:40:04,700
it's,

6278
02:40:04,700 --> 02:40:05,560
it's such a,

6279
02:40:05,990 --> 02:40:09,530
and then what I want to do with the
CMT two on for Dana white saying in

6280
02:40:09,531 --> 02:40:14,010
interviews if any competition
promotion was that it had any

6281
02:40:14,010 --> 02:40:14,550
brains,

6282
02:40:14,550 --> 02:40:18,990
they'd steal everything that I'm doing
in the UFC and try and replicate that for

6283
02:40:18,991 --> 02:40:21,330
their own promotion because what
we're doing is a winning formula.

6284
02:40:21,600 --> 02:40:23,370
So that's what I want to
try and do with my show.

6285
02:40:23,371 --> 02:40:24,750
I'm trying to bring in the nationals in,

6286
02:40:24,751 --> 02:40:29,220
I'm trying to decorate the every
single aspect as much as I can.

6287
02:40:29,221 --> 02:40:31,320
Similar but in the striking world.

6288
02:40:31,760 --> 02:40:35,400
So do you think that that's what you'll
be your primary focus when you retire

6289
02:40:35,401 --> 02:40:38,010
and promoting and promoting
like cage Moitai I,

6290
02:40:38,250 --> 02:40:38,491
yeah,

6291
02:40:38,491 --> 02:40:42,240
my life is fighting whether I'm doing
an o promoting it or teaching it or

6292
02:40:42,241 --> 02:40:47,241
seminars or I have no other
interest outside of fighting.

6293
02:40:47,760 --> 02:40:49,770
That ad is all I do.

6294
02:40:49,800 --> 02:40:50,633
And then that's my,

6295
02:40:50,910 --> 02:40:52,770
my wife's life as well between us.

6296
02:40:52,800 --> 02:40:53,633
Um,

6297
02:40:53,700 --> 02:40:54,533
yeah,

6298
02:40:54,590 --> 02:40:55,520
that's the eighth.

6299
02:40:55,560 --> 02:40:56,393
I don't know.

6300
02:40:56,400 --> 02:40:58,260
I didn't even know that there
is a world outside of fighting.

6301
02:41:00,830 --> 02:41:04,620
When you watch MMA and so you
watch like UFC a high level UFC,

6302
02:41:04,890 --> 02:41:05,280
what,

6303
02:41:05,280 --> 02:41:08,880
what is the one thing that you think that,

6304
02:41:08,881 --> 02:41:09,360
uh,

6305
02:41:09,360 --> 02:41:11,190
when you see a little striking,

6306
02:41:11,590 --> 02:41:15,330
is there anything that bugs you is you
think that things that you watch it,

6307
02:41:15,331 --> 02:41:19,620
you see people doing wrong or things
you would like to see them improve upon?

6308
02:41:20,300 --> 02:41:21,133
I enjoy,

6309
02:41:21,210 --> 02:41:22,350
I enjoy worries.

6310
02:41:22,410 --> 02:41:25,170
I enjoy people that are willing
to put it all on the line.

6311
02:41:25,530 --> 02:41:26,311
Uh,

6312
02:41:26,311 --> 02:41:27,120
even,

6313
02:41:27,120 --> 02:41:27,660
uh,

6314
02:41:27,660 --> 02:41:30,090
gentlemen such as Diego Sanchez,

6315
02:41:30,360 --> 02:41:33,600
like he's striking to me isn't elite,

6316
02:41:33,601 --> 02:41:34,820
but at the same time he,

6317
02:41:35,140 --> 02:41:35,550
he,

6318
02:41:35,550 --> 02:41:37,050
he drops his hands,

6319
02:41:37,051 --> 02:41:38,280
he causes his opponent on,

6320
02:41:38,430 --> 02:41:40,410
he screams and he runs in.

6321
02:41:40,590 --> 02:41:40,981
For me.

6322
02:41:40,981 --> 02:41:41,671
That's excitement.

6323
02:41:41,671 --> 02:41:42,070
It doesn't,

6324
02:41:42,070 --> 02:41:44,040
it doesn't have to be
technical or textbook,

6325
02:41:44,370 --> 02:41:45,450
but to have that,

6326
02:41:45,480 --> 02:41:45,900
uh,

6327
02:41:45,900 --> 02:41:48,720
that adrenaline dump of sitting there
and watching him for a whole round just

6328
02:41:48,721 --> 02:41:50,400
going crazy to me,

6329
02:41:50,401 --> 02:41:50,651
that's,

6330
02:41:50,651 --> 02:41:50,900
that's,

6331
02:41:50,900 --> 02:41:51,570
that's amazing.

6332
02:41:51,570 --> 02:41:53,070
He's one of my all time
favorites for sure.

6333
02:41:53,430 --> 02:41:54,030
Because of that.

6334
02:41:54,030 --> 02:41:55,170
And then John Jones,

6335
02:41:55,171 --> 02:41:55,441
again,

6336
02:41:55,441 --> 02:41:56,274
like you're saying,

6337
02:41:56,430 --> 02:41:58,710
different elements of
his elbow strikes a goof.

6338
02:41:58,711 --> 02:42:00,330
Listen for another example,

6339
02:42:00,600 --> 02:42:01,390
uh,

6340
02:42:01,390 --> 02:42:01,800
there,

6341
02:42:01,800 --> 02:42:03,630
everyone has their Anthony Johnson,

6342
02:42:05,190 --> 02:42:06,090
he's boxing.

6343
02:42:06,150 --> 02:42:08,040
You wouldn't say his textbook boxing,

6344
02:42:08,041 --> 02:42:09,960
but at the same time
if he hit you year out.

6345
02:42:10,340 --> 02:42:11,550
So I love that.

6346
02:42:11,580 --> 02:42:12,413
I love it.

6347
02:42:12,560 --> 02:42:15,720
That's why I love it because I'm on
the edge of my seat every single,

6348
02:42:15,721 --> 02:42:17,430
if that's what UFC so good too.

6349
02:42:17,760 --> 02:42:20,370
You don't have to wait until the
main event to watch the fight.

6350
02:42:20,400 --> 02:42:24,180
She can sit there from the prelims to
the last fight and enjoy every single

6351
02:42:24,181 --> 02:42:26,880
fight because you know that every
single fight is going to be completely

6352
02:42:26,881 --> 02:42:27,151
different.

6353
02:42:27,151 --> 02:42:29,160
To the last question about that,

6354
02:42:29,250 --> 02:42:30,690
but as a world class striker,

6355
02:42:30,691 --> 02:42:32,130
when you watch guys in the UFC,

6356
02:42:32,131 --> 02:42:33,480
do you see holes in their,

6357
02:42:33,481 --> 02:42:34,680
their style or do,

6358
02:42:34,681 --> 02:42:35,850
when you watch MMA,

6359
02:42:36,040 --> 02:42:37,200
it doesn't even have to be UFC,

6360
02:42:37,230 --> 02:42:39,150
like just any MMA.

6361
02:42:39,280 --> 02:42:40,051
Do you see,

6362
02:42:40,051 --> 02:42:40,420
like,

6363
02:42:40,420 --> 02:42:44,870
what do you think about the level when
you come from a world championship Muay

6364
02:42:44,870 --> 02:42:45,870
Thai fighters perspective,

6365
02:42:46,110 --> 02:42:48,690
what do you think about the
level of kickboxing and MMA?

6366
02:42:48,770 --> 02:42:49,400
Uh,

6367
02:42:49,400 --> 02:42:49,690
if it,

6368
02:42:49,690 --> 02:42:51,120
if it was pure kickboxing rules.

6369
02:42:51,121 --> 02:42:51,570
It.

6370
02:42:51,570 --> 02:42:51,811
Yeah,

6371
02:42:51,811 --> 02:42:52,001
it's,

6372
02:42:52,001 --> 02:42:52,680
it's,

6373
02:42:52,680 --> 02:42:54,060
it's different kettle of fish,

6374
02:42:54,090 --> 02:42:54,271
but,

6375
02:42:54,271 --> 02:42:54,480
um,

6376
02:42:54,480 --> 02:42:54,691
it's,

6377
02:42:54,691 --> 02:42:54,990
it's,

6378
02:42:54,990 --> 02:42:55,440
it's,

6379
02:42:55,440 --> 02:42:56,273
it's entertaining.

6380
02:42:56,400 --> 02:42:57,360
I watch it for then.

6381
02:42:57,390 --> 02:42:58,223
Yeah.

6382
02:42:58,420 --> 02:42:59,040
I can't,

6383
02:42:59,040 --> 02:43:01,800
I can't say it's good or bad
because what they're do works.

6384
02:43:02,310 --> 02:43:06,020
And also you have to consider the fact
that they're avoiding take downs and

6385
02:43:06,021 --> 02:43:06,830
things.

6386
02:43:06,830 --> 02:43:08,700
There's so many different elements for me,

6387
02:43:08,730 --> 02:43:09,563
for me to say,

6388
02:43:09,930 --> 02:43:10,471
this is good,

6389
02:43:10,471 --> 02:43:11,290
this is bad.

6390
02:43:11,290 --> 02:43:11,860
Um,

6391
02:43:11,860 --> 02:43:13,300
I would be disrespecting the sports,

6392
02:43:13,301 --> 02:43:16,060
so I'd rather I,

6393
02:43:16,380 --> 02:43:17,680
it's in the day.

6394
02:43:17,740 --> 02:43:17,990
Uh,

6395
02:43:17,990 --> 02:43:22,030
it's entertainment and that's why I
invested my money every single weekend.

6396
02:43:22,031 --> 02:43:22,990
Cause I love it.

6397
02:43:23,020 --> 02:43:24,060
I think it's amazing.

6398
02:43:24,240 --> 02:43:24,610
And I'm a,

6399
02:43:24,610 --> 02:43:25,580
I'm a Moitai guy.

6400
02:43:25,810 --> 02:43:26,680
I love UFC.

6401
02:43:27,070 --> 02:43:28,090
So yeah,

6402
02:43:28,420 --> 02:43:29,800
I just wish I was

6403
02:43:31,490 --> 02:43:32,440
a young teenager.

6404
02:43:32,470 --> 02:43:33,303
They're just letting you know.

6405
02:43:33,400 --> 02:43:34,233
I know.

6406
02:43:34,630 --> 02:43:35,321
I know which path.

6407
02:43:35,321 --> 02:43:36,160
I definitely go.

6408
02:43:36,220 --> 02:43:37,690
You'd go down the MMA path.

6409
02:43:37,730 --> 02:43:38,520
I see.

6410
02:43:38,520 --> 02:43:38,890
Yeah.

6411
02:43:38,890 --> 02:43:39,970
I wasn't so big.

6412
02:43:40,090 --> 02:43:42,100
I want to be the Anthony
Pettis on the Wheaties box.

6413
02:43:42,460 --> 02:43:42,940
I'd love to,

6414
02:43:42,940 --> 02:43:44,740
I'd love to be the George St Ph

6415
02:43:46,980 --> 02:43:51,980
in living in a penthouse and being in
the UN unlost commercials in the run the

6416
02:43:52,031 --> 02:43:52,511
reality.

6417
02:43:52,511 --> 02:43:54,210
And then there's,

6418
02:43:54,550 --> 02:43:54,940
yeah,

6419
02:43:54,940 --> 02:43:55,290
it's be,

6420
02:43:55,290 --> 02:43:57,340
do you plan on training MMA fighters?

6421
02:43:57,350 --> 02:43:57,971
Do you mean,

6422
02:43:57,971 --> 02:43:59,590
I know you work with George quite a bit.

6423
02:43:59,620 --> 02:43:59,951
Uh,

6424
02:43:59,951 --> 02:44:01,420
I've worked with him
once for the two weeks.

6425
02:44:01,421 --> 02:44:02,254
That was pretty cool.

6426
02:44:02,530 --> 02:44:03,010
Um,

6427
02:44:03,010 --> 02:44:07,420
I worked with a couple of gentlemen
in Australia that are coming up,

6428
02:44:07,720 --> 02:44:08,500
so,

6429
02:44:08,500 --> 02:44:11,760
but if the opportunity arose
and someone would like to to,

6430
02:44:12,050 --> 02:44:12,460
yeah,

6431
02:44:12,460 --> 02:44:13,211
shoot me an email,

6432
02:44:13,211 --> 02:44:16,430
I'm happy to know all those training
sessions that you did with George over the

6433
02:44:16,750 --> 02:44:17,260
two weeks.

6434
02:44:17,260 --> 02:44:18,800
Which fight was that for Hendrix?

6435
02:44:18,840 --> 02:44:19,270
Hendrix.

6436
02:44:19,270 --> 02:44:20,103
He's very last one.

6437
02:44:20,320 --> 02:44:23,230
And w what did you guys basically work on?

6438
02:44:23,280 --> 02:44:24,630
Was Hendrick was a southpaw.

6439
02:44:24,640 --> 02:44:25,870
So we're working on,

6440
02:44:26,160 --> 02:44:26,440
uh,

6441
02:44:26,440 --> 02:44:30,280
keeping everything basic and then
lots of right hand left hooks,

6442
02:44:30,281 --> 02:44:30,971
lots of insight.

6443
02:44:30,971 --> 02:44:32,570
Like he's with the right leg for the,

6444
02:44:32,620 --> 02:44:34,540
the tech yet that lead Southport leg,

6445
02:44:34,840 --> 02:44:35,673
uh,

6446
02:44:35,710 --> 02:44:38,620
moving away from the power left
hand because he's a monster.

6447
02:44:39,070 --> 02:44:39,521
Uh,

6448
02:44:39,521 --> 02:44:44,380
and then every time we'd spa I
replicate a Johnny spiring style.

6449
02:44:44,381 --> 02:44:44,891
So lots of,

6450
02:44:44,891 --> 02:44:47,980
I'd throw lots of overhand
lefts and just being that,

6451
02:44:47,981 --> 02:44:49,570
that craziness exploding in.

6452
02:44:50,040 --> 02:44:50,480
Um,

6453
02:44:50,480 --> 02:44:51,260
and then Georgia was,

6454
02:44:51,260 --> 02:44:51,970
uh,

6455
02:44:51,970 --> 02:44:52,803
uh,

6456
02:44:53,050 --> 02:44:53,883
uh,

6457
02:44:54,070 --> 02:44:54,340
uh,

6458
02:44:54,340 --> 02:44:55,173
John Denver here,

6459
02:44:55,220 --> 02:44:55,930
um,

6460
02:44:55,930 --> 02:44:58,030
after a week of having George on the pads,

6461
02:44:58,200 --> 02:44:58,480
um,

6462
02:44:58,480 --> 02:45:00,840
he was blown away about how much power I,

6463
02:45:00,890 --> 02:45:01,600
I,

6464
02:45:01,600 --> 02:45:03,070
I was starting to get out of George's,

6465
02:45:03,071 --> 02:45:03,730
um,

6466
02:45:03,730 --> 02:45:07,120
punches and kicks and then freestyling
and the pads that he never number four.

6467
02:45:07,120 --> 02:45:08,240
And um,

6468
02:45:08,860 --> 02:45:09,221
yeah,

6469
02:45:09,221 --> 02:45:09,730
it was,

6470
02:45:09,730 --> 02:45:11,170
we had such a good time.

6471
02:45:11,230 --> 02:45:11,950
Uh,

6472
02:45:11,950 --> 02:45:14,170
but then I came to la,

6473
02:45:14,590 --> 02:45:15,880
I came too early in the camp.

6474
02:45:15,910 --> 02:45:19,840
There was still 14 weeks between
our training session and the fight.

6475
02:45:19,841 --> 02:45:21,490
So by the time I went back to Australia,

6476
02:45:21,870 --> 02:45:22,370
uh,

6477
02:45:22,370 --> 02:45:22,670
he,

6478
02:45:22,670 --> 02:45:25,990
he sort of went back to
the old training regime.

6479
02:45:26,020 --> 02:45:28,430
And then what was the difference
between your training?

6480
02:45:28,431 --> 02:45:31,450
When I had the pleasure of working out
with you and one of the things that I

6481
02:45:31,451 --> 02:45:34,450
found was really interesting is
that even when you throw a jab,

6482
02:45:34,451 --> 02:45:36,310
you're throwing a jab
almost like a right hand.

6483
02:45:36,550 --> 02:45:37,211
He's throwing a jab,

6484
02:45:37,211 --> 02:45:40,570
like you're pulling back with your right
hand and fucking thrusting with your

6485
02:45:40,571 --> 02:45:41,200
left hand.

6486
02:45:41,200 --> 02:45:42,033
Yes.

6487
02:45:42,130 --> 02:45:44,380
Was that like the style that I had,

6488
02:45:44,381 --> 02:45:45,140
George George,

6489
02:45:45,140 --> 02:45:48,370
when George was double jabbing
before it was a long Jab,

6490
02:45:48,371 --> 02:45:51,600
Short Jab was I had him cocking
that shoulder for both jabs.

6491
02:45:51,600 --> 02:45:52,450
So both of them were,

6492
02:45:52,451 --> 02:45:53,230
were um,

6493
02:45:53,230 --> 02:45:56,380
and I'll make them big
cracking was Bam Bam.

6494
02:45:56,520 --> 02:45:57,110
Yeah.

6495
02:45:57,110 --> 02:46:01,840
That you were trying to get him to be
more aggressive with his power or is that

6496
02:46:01,841 --> 02:46:03,580
what you were concentrating
on joining to execute?

6497
02:46:03,610 --> 02:46:04,090
Um,

6498
02:46:04,090 --> 02:46:04,391
yeah,

6499
02:46:04,391 --> 02:46:07,510
well a lot more power shots
and just keeping it simple.

6500
02:46:07,540 --> 02:46:08,373
So,

6501
02:46:08,520 --> 02:46:08,840
uh,

6502
02:46:08,840 --> 02:46:11,760
keeping it down to four or five
different techniques against a southpaw,

6503
02:46:11,780 --> 02:46:12,760
because against the South Pole,

6504
02:46:12,761 --> 02:46:12,901
you,

6505
02:46:12,901 --> 02:46:14,390
you can't do the crazy tricks.

6506
02:46:14,720 --> 02:46:15,740
You've got to keep it basic.

6507
02:46:15,741 --> 02:46:19,580
But I'm smart so you don't want to
run into that left power hand either.

6508
02:46:19,970 --> 02:46:21,380
And then I believe,

6509
02:46:21,740 --> 02:46:22,281
uh,

6510
02:46:22,281 --> 02:46:23,780
he fought the wrong fight against Johnny.

6511
02:46:23,781 --> 02:46:27,530
He was moving into the hand instead of
away from the hand and then he took a lot

6512
02:46:27,531 --> 02:46:28,100
of damage.

6513
02:46:28,100 --> 02:46:28,760
Uh,

6514
02:46:28,760 --> 02:46:30,680
and I believe we talked
about this last time as well.

6515
02:46:30,910 --> 02:46:31,111
I,

6516
02:46:31,111 --> 02:46:34,100
I believe George marginally
just won that fight,

6517
02:46:34,130 --> 02:46:34,963
just,

6518
02:46:35,030 --> 02:46:35,450
um,

6519
02:46:35,450 --> 02:46:36,210
but I,

6520
02:46:36,210 --> 02:46:39,140
I think if I had stayed there for a
little bit longer or closer to the fight,

6521
02:46:39,141 --> 02:46:39,310
I,

6522
02:46:39,310 --> 02:46:39,580
I,

6523
02:46:39,580 --> 02:46:42,050
I could have gotten away with them.

6524
02:46:43,030 --> 02:46:43,863
Less damage.

6525
02:46:44,290 --> 02:46:45,110
Um,

6526
02:46:45,110 --> 02:46:45,830
yeah.

6527
02:46:45,830 --> 02:46:47,090
Do you think the punishment,

6528
02:46:47,360 --> 02:46:47,691
sorry,

6529
02:46:47,691 --> 02:46:48,201
do you think that he,

6530
02:46:48,201 --> 02:46:52,670
maybe he had one foot out the door because
he was kind of saying after that fire

6531
02:46:52,671 --> 02:46:53,421
through is really,

6532
02:46:53,421 --> 02:46:53,820
you know,

6533
02:46:53,820 --> 02:46:54,390
it's,

6534
02:46:54,390 --> 02:46:57,710
it's probably wants to take some
time on any one of retiring,

6535
02:46:57,860 --> 02:47:00,830
but he wanted to take some time
away and that this was just a,

6536
02:47:00,831 --> 02:47:01,430
you know,

6537
02:47:01,430 --> 02:47:02,390
it was too much for him.

6538
02:47:02,391 --> 02:47:04,040
Do you think that coming into that fight,

6539
02:47:04,041 --> 02:47:05,390
maybe he had that in his head?

6540
02:47:06,020 --> 02:47:06,820
Possibly.

6541
02:47:06,820 --> 02:47:08,780
It's always a bad spot
for a fighter to be at.

6542
02:47:08,790 --> 02:47:09,110
Right?

6543
02:47:09,110 --> 02:47:10,340
I have one foot out the door.

6544
02:47:10,380 --> 02:47:10,700
Yeah.

6545
02:47:10,700 --> 02:47:11,930
I was saying to my friend Kevin,

6546
02:47:12,050 --> 02:47:12,883
uh,

6547
02:47:13,370 --> 02:47:14,130
I,

6548
02:47:14,130 --> 02:47:14,660
I,

6549
02:47:14,660 --> 02:47:15,980
it was the highlight of my,

6550
02:47:15,981 --> 02:47:16,280
uh,

6551
02:47:16,280 --> 02:47:20,720
training as a person who was training
George first two weeks and the first three

6552
02:47:20,721 --> 02:47:21,650
days that I was with him,

6553
02:47:22,010 --> 02:47:25,880
it was so mind blowing
that how famous he was.

6554
02:47:26,180 --> 02:47:28,680
People coming up morning
taken further is we,

6555
02:47:28,790 --> 02:47:29,623
we're eating.

6556
02:47:29,990 --> 02:47:31,670
And then after the third day,

6557
02:47:31,671 --> 02:47:32,420
fourth day fee,

6558
02:47:32,420 --> 02:47:33,920
then you realize this thing,

6559
02:47:33,950 --> 02:47:34,161
this,

6560
02:47:34,161 --> 02:47:35,810
the machine doesn't turn off.

6561
02:47:36,290 --> 02:47:36,920
And then,

6562
02:47:36,920 --> 02:47:37,310
um,

6563
02:47:37,310 --> 02:47:40,400
he can't go to the chemist to buy shampoo.

6564
02:47:40,401 --> 02:47:41,660
He can't chemist,

6565
02:47:42,430 --> 02:47:45,730
let's call a pharmacy,

6566
02:47:46,340 --> 02:47:47,110
call the cameras.

6567
02:47:47,110 --> 02:47:47,943
Do you go,

6568
02:47:48,140 --> 02:47:49,700
where the fuck are you
getting your champion?

6569
02:47:52,760 --> 02:47:53,481
He might go,

6570
02:47:53,481 --> 02:47:57,140
he might go into the toilets to pass
stool and you've got people waiting at the

6571
02:47:57,141 --> 02:47:59,540
side of the cubicle to wait
to get a photo with him.

6572
02:47:59,541 --> 02:48:00,290
So He's,

6573
02:48:00,290 --> 02:48:01,123
and then we've got to,

6574
02:48:01,190 --> 02:48:02,180
every time we went somewhere,

6575
02:48:02,181 --> 02:48:03,890
it always have to be
through the VIP entrance.

6576
02:48:03,891 --> 02:48:05,120
He couldn't walk through the front door,

6577
02:48:05,330 --> 02:48:05,810
uh,

6578
02:48:05,810 --> 02:48:06,700
especially Montreal.

6579
02:48:06,701 --> 02:48:06,950
Right?

6580
02:48:06,950 --> 02:48:11,390
So one time we went to a nightclub and
then we've got in through the VIP and

6581
02:48:11,391 --> 02:48:11,791
then we'll,

6582
02:48:11,791 --> 02:48:12,890
we'll walk into our,

6583
02:48:12,980 --> 02:48:13,270
uh,

6584
02:48:13,270 --> 02:48:14,103
our table.

6585
02:48:14,210 --> 02:48:17,670
And then we're about maybe 15 feet
from their table and someone says,

6586
02:48:17,730 --> 02:48:20,400
Jews Birger as p and would,

6587
02:48:20,410 --> 02:48:21,530
where the word of a lie.

6588
02:48:21,610 --> 02:48:22,010
Um,

6589
02:48:22,010 --> 02:48:23,960
the whole dance force stopped dancing.

6590
02:48:24,290 --> 02:48:28,400
Everyone's looked at us turn and the
whole club's walk towards that table.

6591
02:48:28,650 --> 02:48:29,370
And,

6592
02:48:29,370 --> 02:48:30,203
um,

6593
02:48:30,230 --> 02:48:31,280
without losing a beat,

6594
02:48:31,390 --> 02:48:33,710
we've turned straight back around
and walked straight back out.

6595
02:48:33,711 --> 02:48:34,250
And that club,

6596
02:48:34,250 --> 02:48:34,611
because,

6597
02:48:34,611 --> 02:48:35,330
uh,

6598
02:48:35,330 --> 02:48:39,890
it was like a tsunami of fans that
had just come into real sit down.

6599
02:48:40,190 --> 02:48:40,431
He said,

6600
02:48:40,431 --> 02:48:40,551
well,

6601
02:48:40,551 --> 02:48:42,630
we'll come back here in a
couple of years later when that,

6602
02:48:42,631 --> 02:48:43,970
when they're distracted.

6603
02:48:44,290 --> 02:48:44,601
Um,

6604
02:48:44,601 --> 02:48:47,300
I can't come in right now because of this.

6605
02:48:47,350 --> 02:48:48,950
Every day is this doesn't,

6606
02:48:48,990 --> 02:48:49,430
yeah,

6607
02:48:49,430 --> 02:48:49,700
I,

6608
02:48:49,700 --> 02:48:50,211
this is,

6609
02:48:50,211 --> 02:48:51,140
this is normal.

6610
02:48:51,950 --> 02:48:52,191
And he's,

6611
02:48:52,191 --> 02:48:56,210
what he has is a good friends that are
his body bodyguards that stand around in

6612
02:48:56,211 --> 02:48:57,050
the whole time because,

6613
02:48:57,051 --> 02:48:57,690
uh,

6614
02:48:57,690 --> 02:48:58,010
uh,

6615
02:48:58,010 --> 02:48:58,421
people said,

6616
02:48:58,421 --> 02:48:59,240
can I get a photo?

6617
02:48:59,240 --> 02:49:00,800
And the body guys will step in and say,

6618
02:49:00,810 --> 02:49:01,160
oh,

6619
02:49:01,160 --> 02:49:01,580
no,

6620
02:49:01,580 --> 02:49:01,761
no.

6621
02:49:01,761 --> 02:49:02,131
Flashy.

6622
02:49:02,131 --> 02:49:03,260
As soon as the flash goes off,

6623
02:49:03,320 --> 02:49:04,580
then the whole club's going to come.

6624
02:49:05,090 --> 02:49:06,260
And then Georgia say yes,

6625
02:49:06,500 --> 02:49:07,141
and then the body goes,

6626
02:49:07,141 --> 02:49:07,291
oh,

6627
02:49:07,291 --> 02:49:07,860
sorry.

6628
02:49:07,860 --> 02:49:08,030
Ah,

6629
02:49:08,030 --> 02:49:08,670
but George say,

6630
02:49:08,670 --> 02:49:08,850
yes,

6631
02:49:08,850 --> 02:49:09,683
look me.

6632
02:49:09,720 --> 02:49:10,321
You don't understand.

6633
02:49:10,321 --> 02:49:11,460
If the camera goes in,

6634
02:49:11,461 --> 02:49:16,461
we got a problem and everybody's
gonna want to photo in any,

6635
02:49:17,281 --> 02:49:18,420
even at a red light.

6636
02:49:18,421 --> 02:49:19,290
We're driving in the car.

6637
02:49:19,300 --> 02:49:20,550
Me and George got the radio,

6638
02:49:21,430 --> 02:49:22,263
big jar.

6639
02:49:22,740 --> 02:49:23,121
We stopped,

6640
02:49:23,121 --> 02:49:24,270
we stopped at a red light.

6641
02:49:24,300 --> 02:49:25,440
And the way he was GSP,

6642
02:49:25,441 --> 02:49:28,800
GSP and four t's credit champion,

6643
02:49:28,810 --> 02:49:33,690
easy always Luke's wave smalls and then
certainly just juice for just a fraction

6644
02:49:33,691 --> 02:49:36,180
just so he's out of
eyesight of of the fans.

6645
02:49:36,181 --> 02:49:37,350
But it's um,

6646
02:49:37,380 --> 02:49:38,230
but that's every,

6647
02:49:38,670 --> 02:49:43,500
every single he'd rather from your car
park even he'd catch a taxi from the

6648
02:49:43,501 --> 02:49:48,501
front gate to the back gate because it
from walking a hundred feet would be a

6649
02:49:49,110 --> 02:49:49,590
half an hour,

6650
02:49:49,590 --> 02:49:50,423
um,

6651
02:49:50,580 --> 02:49:53,160
with photos and handshakes
and high fives and,

6652
02:49:53,490 --> 02:49:54,510
and people are rude.

6653
02:49:54,600 --> 02:49:55,590
People are crazy.

6654
02:49:55,591 --> 02:49:58,410
People would just come up and they stick
their phone in his face like this and

6655
02:49:58,810 --> 02:50:03,090
then you know what it's like you're a
superstar and you'd have this every single

6656
02:50:03,091 --> 02:50:03,570
day as well.

6657
02:50:03,570 --> 02:50:07,950
Surely you don't have any my sticking
their phone directly in my face too often,

6658
02:50:07,951 --> 02:50:09,150
but it's happened a few times.

6659
02:50:09,151 --> 02:50:09,660
Yeah.

6660
02:50:09,660 --> 02:50:13,080
I think with George is a totally different
thing because he's a national hero as

6661
02:50:13,081 --> 02:50:13,800
well.

6662
02:50:13,800 --> 02:50:17,850
I mean he won sportsman of the year award
in Canada where hockey is like their

6663
02:50:17,851 --> 02:50:18,810
national sport.

6664
02:50:18,840 --> 02:50:19,280
Yes.

6665
02:50:19,280 --> 02:50:21,210
And he went over hockey players.

6666
02:50:21,240 --> 02:50:21,451
I mean,

6667
02:50:21,451 --> 02:50:22,410
he was on the fucking,

6668
02:50:22,620 --> 02:50:24,600
he was in these Gatorade commercials.

6669
02:50:24,601 --> 02:50:24,841
I mean,

6670
02:50:24,841 --> 02:50:27,300
he had transcended the sport to the,

6671
02:50:27,520 --> 02:50:28,230
to the fact,

6672
02:50:28,230 --> 02:50:32,460
the point where he was a international
superstar and he's from Canada and

6673
02:50:32,461 --> 02:50:33,900
they're so proud of that in Canada.

6674
02:50:33,901 --> 02:50:35,340
Canada's such a proud country.

6675
02:50:35,420 --> 02:50:35,700
Yes.

6676
02:50:35,700 --> 02:50:39,210
But a guy like George is probably a
hundred times more famous than me.

6677
02:50:39,360 --> 02:50:41,310
We'll wait till we went
to New York for the,

6678
02:50:41,311 --> 02:50:41,881
for one week,

6679
02:50:41,881 --> 02:50:42,511
the train with them,

6680
02:50:42,511 --> 02:50:43,230
John Dana here.

6681
02:50:43,230 --> 02:50:45,390
And I'm at the Gracies as academy.

6682
02:50:45,630 --> 02:50:46,740
And even in New York it was,

6683
02:50:46,741 --> 02:50:47,491
it was no different.

6684
02:50:47,491 --> 02:50:50,370
Montreal and New York was just as
insane as each other that it was just,

6685
02:50:50,860 --> 02:50:51,250
well,

6686
02:50:51,250 --> 02:50:51,960
I would think metro,

6687
02:50:51,960 --> 02:50:53,820
I'll be probably a little bit more crazy.

6688
02:50:53,821 --> 02:50:54,391
But yeah,

6689
02:50:54,391 --> 02:50:55,200
at that level,

6690
02:50:55,200 --> 02:50:55,411
I mean,

6691
02:50:55,411 --> 02:50:56,070
George,

6692
02:50:56,070 --> 02:50:57,030
when he was a champion,

6693
02:50:57,031 --> 02:50:57,511
especially,

6694
02:50:57,511 --> 02:50:59,460
I wonder if he could get
around now a little bit better.

6695
02:50:59,520 --> 02:50:59,970
Yeah,

6696
02:50:59,970 --> 02:51:01,040
I hope so.

6697
02:51:01,050 --> 02:51:01,680
I mean,

6698
02:51:01,680 --> 02:51:02,730
people just ask them questions.

6699
02:51:02,731 --> 02:51:03,331
When are you coming back,

6700
02:51:03,331 --> 02:51:04,164
George?

6701
02:51:04,170 --> 02:51:05,830
Who's going to find it as a silver George?

6702
02:51:06,380 --> 02:51:07,213
Um,

6703
02:51:07,410 --> 02:51:08,040
yeah.

6704
02:51:08,040 --> 02:51:09,690
And then even the websites,

6705
02:51:09,691 --> 02:51:10,940
you notice all the,

6706
02:51:11,060 --> 02:51:11,590
uh,

6707
02:51:11,590 --> 02:51:12,960
I read the MMA websites,

6708
02:51:12,961 --> 02:51:13,710
said Bree single day,

6709
02:51:13,710 --> 02:51:16,680
and then there's always at least once a
week there's something about George is

6710
02:51:16,681 --> 02:51:19,230
doing this or he might come
back or this is happening.

6711
02:51:19,231 --> 02:51:20,280
And so he's still,

6712
02:51:20,340 --> 02:51:21,100
he's still relevant.

6713
02:51:21,100 --> 02:51:22,410
He's still hasn't disappeared yet.

6714
02:51:22,411 --> 02:51:23,040
There's still that.

6715
02:51:23,040 --> 02:51:24,840
They still need him in that circle.

6716
02:51:24,990 --> 02:51:28,440
We still training Norco was a in,

6717
02:51:28,441 --> 02:51:28,890
um,

6718
02:51:28,890 --> 02:51:32,370
Tristar recently and he had done some
training with George and I think,

6719
02:51:32,371 --> 02:51:32,611
you know,

6720
02:51:32,611 --> 02:51:34,200
George still has a little bit of the Itch,

6721
02:51:34,201 --> 02:51:35,034
but yeah,

6722
02:51:35,070 --> 02:51:36,000
I'd love for him to come back.

6723
02:51:36,001 --> 02:51:36,541
I think he's,

6724
02:51:36,541 --> 02:51:36,890
uh,

6725
02:51:36,890 --> 02:51:37,590
he's,

6726
02:51:37,590 --> 02:51:38,020
uh,

6727
02:51:38,020 --> 02:51:40,890
he is UFC and he's such a
great ambassador as well.

6728
02:51:40,891 --> 02:51:42,430
He's not just the gentleman,

6729
02:51:42,480 --> 02:51:43,500
not just a great fighter,

6730
02:51:43,501 --> 02:51:45,060
but he represents everything good.

6731
02:51:45,061 --> 02:51:46,470
That's about combat sports.

6732
02:51:47,010 --> 02:51:47,843
I agree.

6733
02:51:47,970 --> 02:51:49,260
Everything good about martial arts.

6734
02:51:49,261 --> 02:51:51,030
And he started as a martial artist.

6735
02:51:51,031 --> 02:51:51,181
I mean,

6736
02:51:51,181 --> 02:51:52,230
that's really what he is.

6737
02:51:52,350 --> 02:51:52,790
Yes.

6738
02:51:52,790 --> 02:51:54,630
And that's why he would always go to the,

6739
02:51:54,860 --> 02:51:56,810
and to the octagon with his key on.

6740
02:51:56,811 --> 02:51:57,211
And you know,

6741
02:51:57,211 --> 02:51:57,901
the whole deal.

6742
02:51:57,901 --> 02:51:58,620
He's a,

6743
02:51:58,620 --> 02:52:02,070
he's a real unique guy
and no better ambassador.

6744
02:52:02,100 --> 02:52:02,600
Like in,

6745
02:52:02,600 --> 02:52:05,190
in his time to carry the flag.

6746
02:52:05,320 --> 02:52:05,770
Yes.

6747
02:52:05,770 --> 02:52:06,161
And then,

6748
02:52:06,161 --> 02:52:06,430
uh,

6749
02:52:06,430 --> 02:52:06,781
to,

6750
02:52:06,781 --> 02:52:07,240
um,

6751
02:52:07,240 --> 02:52:07,850
even,

6752
02:52:07,850 --> 02:52:08,980
uh,

6753
02:52:09,640 --> 02:52:12,730
a lot of people change after the ones
that reached out to superstardom,

6754
02:52:12,760 --> 02:52:16,330
whereas George has always stayed grounded
and then people would come up and

6755
02:52:16,540 --> 02:52:21,460
people had some majority of great and
then some people with the Thomas Baling,

6756
02:52:21,490 --> 02:52:22,150
Hey,

6757
02:52:22,150 --> 02:52:25,000
every time I get a photo of a
celebrity I get carried say,

6758
02:52:25,001 --> 02:52:25,834
pick me up.

6759
02:52:26,290 --> 02:52:26,740
And he's like,

6760
02:52:26,740 --> 02:52:27,573
oh,

6761
02:52:28,690 --> 02:52:29,150
okay.

6762
02:52:29,150 --> 02:52:31,100
They took her or uh,

6763
02:52:31,260 --> 02:52:31,620
just,

6764
02:52:31,620 --> 02:52:34,090
just people are so fucking weird.

6765
02:52:34,091 --> 02:52:36,340
Especially every time I
get a photo of a celebrity,

6766
02:52:36,341 --> 02:52:37,110
I fart on them.

6767
02:52:37,110 --> 02:52:37,690
Yeah,

6768
02:52:37,690 --> 02:52:39,040
come on over here.

6769
02:52:39,090 --> 02:52:39,970
I'm gonna on your own.

6770
02:52:41,140 --> 02:52:43,240
They might have had a few drinks
and there's no politeness.

6771
02:52:43,270 --> 02:52:43,451
Hey,

6772
02:52:43,451 --> 02:52:43,991
I want a photo.

6773
02:52:43,991 --> 02:52:44,824
Give me a photo.

6774
02:52:45,240 --> 02:52:46,021
Well they just grabbed him.

6775
02:52:46,021 --> 02:52:48,760
What that twice in a highlight
where they grab me around the neck,

6776
02:52:49,220 --> 02:52:54,220
give me a photo and just people of
this news and he doesn't change though.

6777
02:52:54,701 --> 02:52:55,534
He's like,

6778
02:52:56,380 --> 02:52:57,101
he doesn't like it,

6779
02:52:57,101 --> 02:52:59,320
but at the same time he does it well.

6780
02:52:59,410 --> 02:53:00,161
He's a,

6781
02:53:00,161 --> 02:53:01,150
he's a good man.

6782
02:53:01,210 --> 02:53:01,900
Yeah,

6783
02:53:01,900 --> 02:53:02,733
man.

6784
02:53:03,370 --> 02:53:06,670
He's a very open minded to have
watched him train with people.

6785
02:53:06,671 --> 02:53:10,120
I think I've seen you in a
few confrontations on Youtube
where people are a bit

6786
02:53:10,121 --> 02:53:11,080
aggressive when it comes.

6787
02:53:11,090 --> 02:53:15,220
The comes to asking for your stuff and
you give half to give them a slight,

6788
02:53:15,221 --> 02:53:15,610
hey,

6789
02:53:15,610 --> 02:53:16,311
just not,

6790
02:53:16,311 --> 02:53:17,140
I don't know necessarily.

6791
02:53:17,140 --> 02:53:20,200
I don't think there's any youtube videos
of people like asking for photos or

6792
02:53:20,201 --> 02:53:20,950
anything like that.

6793
02:53:20,950 --> 02:53:21,541
It might be that,

6794
02:53:21,541 --> 02:53:22,200
I don't know,

6795
02:53:22,200 --> 02:53:22,601
but yeah,

6796
02:53:22,601 --> 02:53:23,381
people get drunk.

6797
02:53:23,381 --> 02:53:23,540
Yeah.

6798
02:53:23,540 --> 02:53:25,000
Alcohol's the worst drug in the world.

6799
02:53:25,420 --> 02:53:28,480
It's the worst drug in the world for
people to make mistakes under pressure too

6800
02:53:28,481 --> 02:53:31,210
because they see a guy like
George and the like hold shoots,

6801
02:53:31,211 --> 02:53:31,640
chores,

6802
02:53:31,640 --> 02:53:33,610
superior orange cured to him.

6803
02:53:33,700 --> 02:53:34,750
You know like whatever.

6804
02:53:34,751 --> 02:53:36,970
The stupid chocolate dao used to get.

6805
02:53:36,971 --> 02:53:39,580
God's trying to pick fights with
them with fucking chocolate.

6806
02:53:39,760 --> 02:53:40,151
Chocolate.

6807
02:53:40,151 --> 02:53:41,740
Dow has all murderers.

6808
02:53:41,741 --> 02:53:43,660
I like you look in his eyes,

6809
02:53:43,661 --> 02:53:46,960
there's killer in there and do it to
get drunk and pick fights with them.

6810
02:53:47,410 --> 02:53:48,790
People are so stupid.

6811
02:53:48,870 --> 02:53:50,070
[inaudible] Donald owned.

6812
02:53:50,071 --> 02:53:52,090
He was telling me some guy
putting on the podcast,

6813
02:53:52,091 --> 02:53:55,120
it sounds like some guy punched him in
the face and the whole foods parking lot.

6814
02:53:55,240 --> 02:53:55,780
Hey.

6815
02:53:55,780 --> 02:53:56,380
And he's like,

6816
02:53:56,380 --> 02:53:57,640
what the fuck man?

6817
02:53:58,370 --> 02:54:00,400
It's like Jesus Christ.

6818
02:54:00,610 --> 02:54:02,320
You just run into the wrong people,

6819
02:54:02,321 --> 02:54:05,920
man and booze and whatever fuck
out they're doing with their head.

6820
02:54:06,670 --> 02:54:07,503
Yeah.

6821
02:54:08,130 --> 02:54:09,100
It's a crap shoot out there.

6822
02:54:09,101 --> 02:54:10,240
And you meet the general public.

6823
02:54:10,260 --> 02:54:10,900
Um,

6824
02:54:10,900 --> 02:54:11,261
yes.

6825
02:54:11,261 --> 02:54:11,830
So,

6826
02:54:11,830 --> 02:54:12,730
uh,

6827
02:54:12,850 --> 02:54:14,830
about youtube.

6828
02:54:15,070 --> 02:54:15,990
Holy Shit Man.

6829
02:54:16,030 --> 02:54:16,990
You had that little spa.

6830
02:54:17,830 --> 02:54:19,090
People are fucking crazy.

6831
02:54:19,091 --> 02:54:20,970
Why do people get um,

6832
02:54:21,040 --> 02:54:25,930
they stay anonymous yet they have such
an opinion that they have to me and you,

6833
02:54:26,170 --> 02:54:26,510
we,

6834
02:54:26,510 --> 02:54:26,780
we,

6835
02:54:26,780 --> 02:54:27,780
we had an understanding.

6836
02:54:27,820 --> 02:54:28,561
You had a sore back.

6837
02:54:28,561 --> 02:54:29,394
He didn't want a spa,

6838
02:54:29,620 --> 02:54:30,090
but you were,

6839
02:54:30,090 --> 02:54:30,460
you said,

6840
02:54:30,460 --> 02:54:30,790
oh look,

6841
02:54:30,790 --> 02:54:31,120
fuck it,

6842
02:54:31,120 --> 02:54:31,690
let's do it.

6843
02:54:31,690 --> 02:54:32,041
And then,

6844
02:54:32,041 --> 02:54:32,650
uh,

6845
02:54:32,650 --> 02:54:34,000
we had the best three minutes.

6846
02:54:34,001 --> 02:54:34,541
We laughed,

6847
02:54:34,541 --> 02:54:35,374
we had fun.

6848
02:54:35,500 --> 02:54:36,520
It was no big deal.

6849
02:54:36,521 --> 02:54:36,870
I said,

6850
02:54:36,870 --> 02:54:37,601
do you mind if I upload it?

6851
02:54:37,601 --> 02:54:37,841
You said,

6852
02:54:37,841 --> 02:54:37,991
yeah,

6853
02:54:37,991 --> 02:54:38,824
go for it.

6854
02:54:38,830 --> 02:54:39,130
Yeah.

6855
02:54:39,130 --> 02:54:41,110
Everyone thinks it's so serious.

6856
02:54:41,111 --> 02:54:43,750
And I also think where somehow
upset at each other or something.

6857
02:54:44,590 --> 02:54:45,190
It was just,

6858
02:54:45,190 --> 02:54:46,090
to me it was fun.

6859
02:54:47,640 --> 02:54:48,071
It was fun.

6860
02:54:48,071 --> 02:54:48,820
It was cool.

6861
02:54:48,820 --> 02:54:50,170
It was a highlight of a,

6862
02:54:50,171 --> 02:54:51,820
we should have probably
recorded the whole thing.

6863
02:54:51,850 --> 02:54:52,050
The,

6864
02:54:52,050 --> 02:54:53,950
there was a highlight of like an whatever,

6865
02:54:53,951 --> 02:54:55,630
an hour and a half of
us training together.

6866
02:54:55,780 --> 02:54:56,470
I was,

6867
02:54:56,470 --> 02:55:01,470
I was really impressed with the lot of
the variations of techniques you do.

6868
02:55:01,811 --> 02:55:03,290
Like the way you throw the knee.

6869
02:55:03,291 --> 02:55:04,124
Especially,

6870
02:55:04,160 --> 02:55:08,210
I never saw anybody throw a knee with
like it completely sideways the way you

6871
02:55:08,211 --> 02:55:10,640
did it and the combinations
in which you did it.

6872
02:55:10,641 --> 02:55:14,180
So I think in MMA or
an in any martial art,

6873
02:55:14,810 --> 02:55:19,430
it's always cool when you get a chance
to work with people and learn a bunch of

6874
02:55:19,431 --> 02:55:24,170
different shit and at the end of it like
throwing some light kicks and and you

6875
02:55:24,171 --> 02:55:24,411
know,

6876
02:55:24,411 --> 02:55:26,450
and punches and stuff and
moving around with each other.

6877
02:55:26,451 --> 02:55:27,380
To me it was just fun.

6878
02:55:27,410 --> 02:55:27,570
Yeah.

6879
02:55:27,570 --> 02:55:29,430
The suspected a bulging disc.

6880
02:55:29,590 --> 02:55:29,960
Yeah.

6881
02:55:29,960 --> 02:55:32,000
Well it's definitely something with it,

6882
02:55:32,380 --> 02:55:34,310
but it's better now that take it like,

6883
02:55:34,311 --> 02:55:35,720
like we were competing like,

6884
02:55:36,110 --> 02:55:37,370
like a UFC title.

6885
02:55:38,060 --> 02:55:41,450
It was a place by or in your
garage for shits and giggles.

6886
02:55:41,870 --> 02:55:42,890
You can't read that though,

6887
02:55:42,891 --> 02:55:43,230
man.

6888
02:55:43,230 --> 02:55:43,620
You can't.

6889
02:55:43,620 --> 02:55:44,720
You're reading the comments.

6890
02:55:44,721 --> 02:55:45,554
You can't read those.

6891
02:55:45,840 --> 02:55:48,050
That's like open yourself up
to the retards of the world.

6892
02:55:48,051 --> 02:55:48,410
Like,

6893
02:55:48,410 --> 02:55:49,243
Hey retards.

6894
02:55:49,490 --> 02:55:49,761
How do you,

6895
02:55:49,761 --> 02:55:50,090
what do you,

6896
02:55:50,090 --> 02:55:52,580
how do you feel I should govern my life?

6897
02:55:52,600 --> 02:55:53,570
What should I do differently?

6898
02:55:56,620 --> 02:55:57,260
Well,

6899
02:55:57,260 --> 02:55:58,580
good news or

6900
02:56:01,140 --> 02:56:02,180
some shit.

6901
02:56:03,250 --> 02:56:03,981
You just can't,

6902
02:56:03,981 --> 02:56:04,930
you can't listen to that.

6903
02:56:04,931 --> 02:56:07,570
I remember I sent you a private
message about two weeks,

6904
02:56:07,571 --> 02:56:08,404
let us gun do.

6905
02:56:08,480 --> 02:56:09,020
How do you,

6906
02:56:09,020 --> 02:56:09,860
how do you put up with it?

6907
02:56:09,861 --> 02:56:10,400
And you said,

6908
02:56:10,400 --> 02:56:12,240
you said just read it.

6909
02:56:12,670 --> 02:56:14,810
Your hook or folk don't go
to good to be a world trip.

6910
02:56:14,811 --> 02:56:18,760
But if it was balled me bro
and open them up and then,

6911
02:56:18,820 --> 02:56:19,141
yeah,

6912
02:56:19,141 --> 02:56:20,600
then directing your technique.

6913
02:56:20,601 --> 02:56:21,434
It was hilarious.

6914
02:56:21,950 --> 02:56:23,270
Was just please shut the fuck up.

6915
02:56:24,030 --> 02:56:29,030
There was a segment of you showing me a
particular combination and someone was

6916
02:56:29,661 --> 02:56:31,100
saying that you were showing it wrong.

6917
02:56:31,250 --> 02:56:31,760
Oh yeah.

6918
02:56:31,760 --> 02:56:32,870
I was reading that and I was like,

6919
02:56:32,871 --> 02:56:33,704
what am I reading this?

6920
02:56:34,160 --> 02:56:34,521
What am I,

6921
02:56:34,521 --> 02:56:34,971
what am I doing?

6922
02:56:34,971 --> 02:56:35,151
I'm,

6923
02:56:35,151 --> 02:56:35,290
I'm,

6924
02:56:35,290 --> 02:56:36,440
I'm not even taking my own advice.

6925
02:56:37,250 --> 02:56:38,180
And meanwhile if you,

6926
02:56:38,181 --> 02:56:40,910
if you found that guy
probably weighs six pounds,

6927
02:56:41,180 --> 02:56:42,560
he's in his mom's basement,

6928
02:56:42,561 --> 02:56:43,580
shit in his own pants.

6929
02:56:43,760 --> 02:56:48,760
Like who knows who you're listening when
you read a sentence on the Internet and

6930
02:56:48,951 --> 02:56:51,050
it starts with a letter
and it ends with a period,

6931
02:56:51,051 --> 02:56:54,050
it looks like a normal person
wrote it and you just read it.

6932
02:56:54,051 --> 02:56:59,051
Like if you wrote a sentence or if he
wrote a sentence or some crazy dude who

6933
02:56:59,241 --> 02:57:02,210
has no fucking grasp of reality at all,

6934
02:57:02,330 --> 02:57:06,170
it still looks the same because
it's a sentence and you don't know.

6935
02:57:06,171 --> 02:57:07,330
Like when you read someone's opinion,

6936
02:57:07,350 --> 02:57:08,150
you don't know what the,

6937
02:57:08,150 --> 02:57:08,983
what's that guy like?

6938
02:57:09,140 --> 02:57:10,730
Like that's the thing about opinions.

6939
02:57:10,731 --> 02:57:11,480
If you,

6940
02:57:11,480 --> 02:57:13,010
there's always guys and you know them,

6941
02:57:13,011 --> 02:57:13,820
everybody knows him.

6942
02:57:13,820 --> 02:57:16,850
There's always guys in the gym that
will see someone and they probably don't

6943
02:57:16,851 --> 02:57:17,990
know what the fuck they're doing,

6944
02:57:18,140 --> 02:57:21,110
but they'll see someone hitting the bag
or they see someone doing the technique

6945
02:57:21,111 --> 02:57:22,340
and they'll come over and correct them.

6946
02:57:22,490 --> 02:57:22,731
Right?

6947
02:57:22,731 --> 02:57:24,350
There's always those fucking morons,

6948
02:57:24,440 --> 02:57:24,711
you know,

6949
02:57:24,711 --> 02:57:26,390
there's a million of those fucking morons,

6950
02:57:26,391 --> 02:57:27,200
right?

6951
02:57:27,200 --> 02:57:27,770
Well,

6952
02:57:27,770 --> 02:57:31,490
when you meet that guy and you know he's
an idiot and you know that guy from the

6953
02:57:31,491 --> 02:57:32,060
gym,

6954
02:57:32,060 --> 02:57:32,900
you can just go,

6955
02:57:32,930 --> 02:57:33,231
oh,

6956
02:57:33,231 --> 02:57:34,940
Mike is the guy who gave you advice.

6957
02:57:36,040 --> 02:57:37,130
Mike's half retarded.

6958
02:57:37,400 --> 02:57:38,750
He got shot in the head when he was two.

6959
02:57:38,960 --> 02:57:39,793
You know what?

6960
02:57:40,040 --> 02:57:41,060
This is a difference.

6961
02:57:41,061 --> 02:57:43,880
Treat that and like seeing
the guy's written words.

6962
02:57:44,250 --> 02:57:49,070
It's the beautiful thing about the
Internet is that anybody can say anything.

6963
02:57:49,250 --> 02:57:50,270
They can just that you,

6964
02:57:50,300 --> 02:57:50,630
you,

6965
02:57:50,630 --> 02:57:51,020
you,

6966
02:57:51,020 --> 02:57:52,970
you have a full open,

6967
02:57:52,971 --> 02:57:55,370
free forum for expressing yourself.

6968
02:57:55,400 --> 02:57:58,910
But the reality is if you
have a million people,

6969
02:57:58,940 --> 02:57:59,773
okay,

6970
02:58:00,620 --> 02:58:04,410
at least 1% of those people are going
to be out of their fucking minds.

6971
02:58:04,890 --> 02:58:07,950
At least 1% so if you've
got a hundred people,

6972
02:58:07,951 --> 02:58:09,060
that's one person.

6973
02:58:09,270 --> 02:58:13,200
But if you've got a million
people or 100 million people,

6974
02:58:13,410 --> 02:58:14,191
look at the United States,

6975
02:58:14,191 --> 02:58:15,540
300 million people,

6976
02:58:15,720 --> 02:58:18,870
how many of those people are
out of their fucking mind?

6977
02:58:18,900 --> 02:58:20,250
It's at least 3 million.

6978
02:58:20,400 --> 02:58:23,430
At least 3 million douchebag.

6979
02:58:23,880 --> 02:58:27,090
They're leaving comments on Youtube and
they get in John Wayne part and talk

6980
02:58:27,091 --> 02:58:27,924
about them.

6981
02:58:28,860 --> 02:58:29,880
I was right.

6982
02:58:30,270 --> 02:58:31,103
It was right.

6983
02:58:31,140 --> 02:58:31,451
He was,

6984
02:58:31,451 --> 02:58:32,400
say it all you want,

6985
02:58:32,401 --> 02:58:34,350
you'll fucking techniques dog shit.

6986
02:58:35,340 --> 02:58:37,460
I don't know how you got to
be a world champion Brown.

6987
02:58:38,690 --> 02:58:39,210
Not,

6988
02:58:39,210 --> 02:58:40,110
not on my watch.

6989
02:58:42,730 --> 02:58:43,810
I'll tell you what,

6990
02:58:44,720 --> 02:58:46,020
it's switch gonna get man.

6991
02:58:46,050 --> 02:58:46,620
It's the world,

6992
02:58:46,620 --> 02:58:47,453
the world we live in.

6993
02:58:47,600 --> 02:58:48,810
It's a beautiful world though.

6994
02:58:48,960 --> 02:58:51,350
It's beautiful and it's chaos and it's,

6995
02:58:51,351 --> 02:58:52,110
it's fun.

6996
02:58:52,110 --> 02:58:53,020
But you got to,

6997
02:58:53,190 --> 02:58:57,060
I think we're all learning how to navigate
this world and the world of comments

6998
02:58:57,061 --> 02:58:57,710
on like,

6999
02:58:57,710 --> 02:59:00,330
I have friends that won't go
on the underground anymore.

7000
02:59:00,331 --> 02:59:00,541
You know,

7001
02:59:00,541 --> 02:59:01,021
fighters,

7002
02:59:01,021 --> 02:59:01,741
they just won't go.

7003
02:59:01,741 --> 02:59:02,130
The Guy,

7004
02:59:02,130 --> 02:59:02,880
I can't,

7005
02:59:02,880 --> 02:59:03,840
it hurts my feelings.

7006
02:59:04,010 --> 02:59:04,290
They go,

7007
02:59:04,290 --> 02:59:04,711
I'll read it,

7008
02:59:04,711 --> 02:59:06,630
but which people are saying
about me and it hurts me,

7009
02:59:06,631 --> 02:59:08,530
but it only hurts you
if you don't know that.

7010
02:59:08,550 --> 02:59:09,180
If you,

7011
02:59:09,180 --> 02:59:10,860
if you knew that guy wouldn't hurt you,

7012
02:59:11,250 --> 02:59:11,641
you know,

7013
02:59:11,641 --> 02:59:13,140
if you were around him
when he was saying that,

7014
02:59:13,141 --> 02:59:13,530
you'd be like,

7015
02:59:13,530 --> 02:59:14,363
Oh,

7016
02:59:14,580 --> 02:59:16,200
you're a fucking idiot.

7017
02:59:16,410 --> 02:59:18,030
You're an idiot with a typewriter.

7018
02:59:18,300 --> 02:59:18,650
You get it.

7019
02:59:18,650 --> 02:59:19,530
The type keys.

7020
02:59:19,620 --> 02:59:20,011
Oh,

7021
02:59:20,011 --> 02:59:20,341
okay.

7022
02:59:20,341 --> 02:59:21,150
I get it.

7023
02:59:21,150 --> 02:59:22,050
But you don't get it.

7024
02:59:22,051 --> 02:59:23,310
When you see this a sentence,

7025
02:59:23,311 --> 02:59:23,821
a sentence.

7026
02:59:23,821 --> 02:59:27,950
It looks like a normal person wrote that
Diego Sanchez written wrote on Twitter

7027
02:59:27,951 --> 02:59:28,784
and saying,

7028
02:59:29,030 --> 02:59:30,150
you bag me up.

7029
02:59:30,151 --> 02:59:31,740
But I bet if we met in person,

7030
02:59:31,741 --> 02:59:33,750
you'd be the first one to me for my gruff.

7031
02:59:34,110 --> 02:59:34,231
Oh,

7032
02:59:34,231 --> 02:59:35,010
it's true.

7033
02:59:35,010 --> 02:59:36,150
They would just say that to him.

7034
02:59:36,170 --> 02:59:36,570
Yeah.

7035
02:59:36,570 --> 02:59:37,740
They talk all kinds of shit with them.

7036
02:59:37,890 --> 02:59:39,720
How can you talk shit about Diego Sanchez?

7037
02:59:39,750 --> 02:59:40,160
Yeah.

7038
02:59:40,160 --> 02:59:44,910
That guy has given more people
the most crazy holy shit.

7039
02:59:44,950 --> 02:59:45,810
Entertainment.

7040
02:59:46,170 --> 02:59:48,810
Diego's had more fucking wild,

7041
02:59:48,870 --> 02:59:53,870
chaotic filled rounds and wild
moments in MMA fucker wins.

7042
02:59:54,421 --> 02:59:57,210
Fights in the third round when
he's losing the first two rounds,

7043
02:59:57,211 --> 03:00:00,810
he's got his face hanging off and he
doesn't give off fuck and he still comes

7044
03:00:00,811 --> 03:00:01,800
out swinging.

7045
03:00:02,020 --> 03:00:05,010
You have to be a real piece of
shit to talk bad about that guy.

7046
03:00:05,080 --> 03:00:06,120
A real piece of shit.

7047
03:00:06,410 --> 03:00:08,320
Melinda is that third round?

7048
03:00:08,950 --> 03:00:10,710
It's still one of my favorite room.

7049
03:00:10,740 --> 03:00:13,500
How he dropped him in an uppercut and
the fucking third round I have to lose in

7050
03:00:13,501 --> 03:00:15,300
those first two rounds drops him,

7051
03:00:15,301 --> 03:00:16,140
almost has 'em out.

7052
03:00:16,380 --> 03:00:17,520
Same thing with Jake Ellenberger.

7053
03:00:17,521 --> 03:00:19,660
He's back to take his bag.

7054
03:00:19,700 --> 03:00:23,970
Man Diego's a warrior that
guys my respect forever.

7055
03:00:24,120 --> 03:00:24,990
He's so crazy.

7056
03:00:25,020 --> 03:00:25,950
Martin Kampmann fight.

7057
03:00:26,100 --> 03:00:26,820
Same thing.

7058
03:00:26,820 --> 03:00:27,511
First two rounds.

7059
03:00:27,511 --> 03:00:30,960
Losing his fucking face is
falling off in the third round.

7060
03:00:30,961 --> 03:00:32,760
He's chasing Martin Kampmann down.

7061
03:00:33,030 --> 03:00:34,350
It's crazy.

7062
03:00:35,510 --> 03:00:35,760
Yeah,

7063
03:00:35,760 --> 03:00:36,630
you got to good ears.

7064
03:00:36,660 --> 03:00:37,493
Pick worries is,

7065
03:00:38,080 --> 03:00:38,371
I mean,

7066
03:00:38,371 --> 03:00:39,150
it's just,

7067
03:00:39,150 --> 03:00:42,060
there's a bunch of disrespectful
shitheads out there.

7068
03:00:42,120 --> 03:00:43,470
And just do you think,

7069
03:00:43,471 --> 03:00:44,640
do you think it's because of the,

7070
03:00:44,641 --> 03:00:45,474
um,

7071
03:00:45,690 --> 03:00:46,351
with my toy,

7072
03:00:46,351 --> 03:00:47,184
for instance,

7073
03:00:47,220 --> 03:00:52,220
we have a culture that's very Buddhism
and is very sweaty cop and everything.

7074
03:00:52,951 --> 03:00:53,790
The whole business.

7075
03:00:53,791 --> 03:00:56,550
It isn't that it's pain that
that means what you're saying.

7076
03:00:56,600 --> 03:00:56,801
Ah,

7077
03:00:56,801 --> 03:00:57,121
yeah,

7078
03:00:57,121 --> 03:00:58,090
it's an hour and put it in.

7079
03:00:58,091 --> 03:01:00,520
But most of these people
full time to time,

7080
03:01:00,640 --> 03:01:01,070
the class,

7081
03:01:01,070 --> 03:01:02,390
the whole prayer,

7082
03:01:02,440 --> 03:01:02,720
it's,

7083
03:01:02,720 --> 03:01:04,510
it's a way of showing that I'm anomaly.

7084
03:01:04,540 --> 03:01:05,850
That's the original,

7085
03:01:06,370 --> 03:01:10,210
instead of shaking hands or toys and then
the males aren't touching the females

7086
03:01:10,211 --> 03:01:10,481
either.

7087
03:01:10,481 --> 03:01:11,314
It's more of a,

7088
03:01:11,340 --> 03:01:11,770
it's a,

7089
03:01:11,770 --> 03:01:15,850
it's a real humility in a real
honest appreciation of each other.

7090
03:01:15,860 --> 03:01:19,060
And they had this century old culture,

7091
03:01:19,360 --> 03:01:23,110
whereas the MMA is so tapping out written,

7092
03:01:23,160 --> 03:01:23,993
uh,

7093
03:01:24,010 --> 03:01:24,450
uh,

7094
03:01:24,450 --> 03:01:25,230
bad wise,

7095
03:01:25,230 --> 03:01:25,920
uh,

7096
03:01:25,920 --> 03:01:26,680
uh,

7097
03:01:26,680 --> 03:01:27,870
just the,

7098
03:01:27,990 --> 03:01:29,130
the fans are,

7099
03:01:29,380 --> 03:01:31,210
it's a different sort of culture.

7100
03:01:31,900 --> 03:01:33,270
Do you believe it's Sorta,

7101
03:01:33,310 --> 03:01:34,390
well that bro Dude,

7102
03:01:34,391 --> 03:01:36,400
bullshit was frowned upon and talk window.

7103
03:01:36,401 --> 03:01:36,641
I mean,

7104
03:01:36,641 --> 03:01:38,890
I grew up in talk window
and which is very,

7105
03:01:39,250 --> 03:01:40,750
I always spoke to my instructor.

7106
03:01:40,751 --> 03:01:42,370
I called him Sir or mister,

7107
03:01:42,970 --> 03:01:44,560
Mr. Kim or sir,

7108
03:01:45,040 --> 03:01:45,671
he said what?

7109
03:01:45,671 --> 03:01:46,510
He said something to me,

7110
03:01:46,511 --> 03:01:47,260
there was no question.

7111
03:01:47,260 --> 03:01:48,130
It was always yes sir.

7112
03:01:48,340 --> 03:01:49,090
And it was always,

7113
03:01:49,090 --> 03:01:54,090
there was this bowing respect
type admiration that you
had for your instructor

7114
03:01:54,821 --> 03:01:56,110
and for fellow competitors.

7115
03:01:56,680 --> 03:01:57,311
And that was,

7116
03:01:57,311 --> 03:01:58,990
that's a big part of what martial arts is.

7117
03:01:58,991 --> 03:02:00,460
This is respect for each other.

7118
03:02:00,820 --> 03:02:01,451
And on the other hand,

7119
03:02:01,451 --> 03:02:02,950
I like the shit talking.

7120
03:02:02,980 --> 03:02:03,401
I like,

7121
03:02:03,401 --> 03:02:04,870
like with Conor McGregor does,

7122
03:02:05,140 --> 03:02:07,510
I like the just bleed guy in the audience.

7123
03:02:09,040 --> 03:02:10,180
It's fun too,

7124
03:02:10,181 --> 03:02:13,480
but I think you lose
something where there's a,

7125
03:02:13,481 --> 03:02:15,400
there's a beautiful
respect to [inaudible].

7126
03:02:15,580 --> 03:02:17,050
And there's another thing about ties.

7127
03:02:17,080 --> 03:02:18,670
The audiences are respectful.

7128
03:02:19,000 --> 03:02:20,200
When you go to those events,

7129
03:02:20,350 --> 03:02:23,200
like you very rarely hear
stupid shipping yelled at,

7130
03:02:23,440 --> 03:02:24,820
even though people were drinking.

7131
03:02:24,970 --> 03:02:25,400
There's a,

7132
03:02:25,400 --> 03:02:29,920
there's applause for both the winner
and the loser is a tremendous amount of

7133
03:02:29,921 --> 03:02:31,600
respect that's involved in it because,

7134
03:02:31,780 --> 03:02:34,660
because it's not that popular
because it's not mainstream.

7135
03:02:34,840 --> 03:02:39,450
Those people in the audience have a
deep appreciation for the art of Moitai.

7136
03:02:39,480 --> 03:02:39,670
Yeah.

7137
03:02:39,670 --> 03:02:40,240
They hide.

7138
03:02:40,240 --> 03:02:41,073
They are there for,

7139
03:02:41,080 --> 03:02:42,050
because they want to see it.

7140
03:02:42,051 --> 03:02:45,100
It's not like it's on TV and then just
watching it for the sake of watching that

7141
03:02:45,120 --> 03:02:45,430
they,

7142
03:02:45,430 --> 03:02:47,550
because they want to be there now.

7143
03:02:47,750 --> 03:02:48,700
That's the only reason.

7144
03:02:48,701 --> 03:02:49,690
It's not a scene.

7145
03:02:49,750 --> 03:02:52,510
It's like they're there to see Moy Tai.

7146
03:02:52,590 --> 03:02:53,020
Yeah.

7147
03:02:53,020 --> 03:02:53,411
And then,

7148
03:02:53,411 --> 03:02:54,000
um,

7149
03:02:54,000 --> 03:02:54,221
yeah,

7150
03:02:54,221 --> 03:02:55,620
they call the MMA culture.

7151
03:02:55,660 --> 03:02:56,600
Just say,

7152
03:02:56,630 --> 03:02:56,840
well,

7153
03:02:56,840 --> 03:03:01,840
there's a lot of fucking posing and
fake and assholes and my friends,

7154
03:03:02,440 --> 03:03:03,970
I'll get my friends tickets,

7155
03:03:04,000 --> 03:03:04,301
you know,

7156
03:03:04,301 --> 03:03:07,000
and they'll go to the fights and
they'll sit beside some guys like,

7157
03:03:07,300 --> 03:03:07,570
well,

7158
03:03:07,570 --> 03:03:12,570
does the fucking punk fucking kick
people just yell out advice and they get

7159
03:03:14,651 --> 03:03:16,020
drunk and they're stupid.

7160
03:03:16,030 --> 03:03:18,310
They're posing because they're insecure.

7161
03:03:18,311 --> 03:03:21,130
So they're drunk at these events and
they're trying to pretend that they know

7162
03:03:21,131 --> 03:03:21,970
more than the fighter.

7163
03:03:22,010 --> 03:03:22,843
No.

7164
03:03:23,670 --> 03:03:24,070
Yes.

7165
03:03:24,070 --> 03:03:24,910
Overwhelming.

7166
03:03:24,970 --> 03:03:25,420
Yeah.

7167
03:03:25,420 --> 03:03:27,700
I'm hoping that the human
race survives this era.

7168
03:03:28,530 --> 03:03:28,750
I mean,

7169
03:03:28,750 --> 03:03:30,040
I'm really hoping that we just,

7170
03:03:30,041 --> 03:03:33,700
this Internet era enlightens us
to our douchey ways and we just,

7171
03:03:33,701 --> 03:03:38,590
we just slowly but surely rise from
the ashes of what we've created.

7172
03:03:38,591 --> 03:03:40,690
But I don't know when I read comments,

7173
03:03:40,691 --> 03:03:41,530
I get confused.

7174
03:03:41,590 --> 03:03:42,423
Who

7175
03:03:44,300 --> 03:03:45,041
listen to my brother.

7176
03:03:45,041 --> 03:03:46,030
We just did three hours.

7177
03:03:46,031 --> 03:03:46,864
We're out of time.

7178
03:03:46,930 --> 03:03:47,260
Sorry.

7179
03:03:47,260 --> 03:03:48,093
Nine o'clock.

7180
03:03:49,120 --> 03:03:51,100
This is the John Wayne
Parks parents night.

7181
03:03:51,280 --> 03:03:52,440
Thank you again anytime,

7182
03:03:52,450 --> 03:03:52,661
man.

7183
03:03:52,661 --> 03:03:53,830
Open invitation please.

7184
03:03:53,831 --> 03:03:54,660
My pleasure.

7185
03:03:54,660 --> 03:03:55,390
Any time.

7186
03:03:55,390 --> 03:03:56,770
And next time we town was train small.

7187
03:03:56,790 --> 03:03:57,623
Let's do it again,

7188
03:03:57,960 --> 03:03:59,000
but still a lot of fun.

7189
03:03:59,240 --> 03:04:00,410
When are you going to be around again?

7190
03:04:00,530 --> 03:04:01,281
You have any plans?

7191
03:04:01,281 --> 03:04:03,210
I'm talking to Hans Hands.

7192
03:04:03,230 --> 03:04:04,490
I'm talking to Scott Kin.

7193
03:04:04,550 --> 03:04:04,820
Uh,

7194
03:04:04,820 --> 03:04:06,410
hopefully I'll be back
as soon as I fuck you.

7195
03:04:06,411 --> 03:04:07,310
They have to have you back,

7196
03:04:07,311 --> 03:04:07,641
man.

7197
03:04:07,641 --> 03:04:07,960
It happened,

7198
03:04:07,960 --> 03:04:09,230
and next time you come back,

7199
03:04:09,530 --> 03:04:10,130
we'll uh,

7200
03:04:10,130 --> 03:04:10,963
make sure,

7201
03:04:10,970 --> 03:04:15,290
probably try to get you in before too
so people can tune in and know that the

7202
03:04:15,291 --> 03:04:16,124
fight is coming.

7203
03:04:16,250 --> 03:04:16,761

03:04:30,051 --> 03:04:31,820
black dynamite should be a lot of fun.

Thank you very much.

Thank you.

03:04:43,761 --> 03:04:44,541
Thank you folks.
