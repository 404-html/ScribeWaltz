1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,830
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:04,750
We're not like in a,

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:08,560
I'm not like in a position where I'm going
to have an actual battle with someone

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:09,573
yet.

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:10,390
I don't know.

6
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:10,780
You're right,

7
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:11,141
but but,

8
00:00:11,141 --> 00:00:13,420
but for competition,

9
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:14,650
no self defense.

10
00:00:14,651 --> 00:00:15,430
Self defense.

11
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:16,550
I mean like I like,

12
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:21,570
see then you can't say that because that
could happen on the way to the grocery

13
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:22,150
store.

14
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:22,691
Oh my God.

15
00:00:22,691 --> 00:00:26,620
You can run into some crazy messed
up chick wants a fucking do get out.

16
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:27,663
Literally

17
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:32,110
like we're doing this.

18
00:00:32,111 --> 00:00:37,111
I wish I had the fucking
manpower literally to like
we were in Nashville like

19
00:00:37,961 --> 00:00:39,850
two weeks ago for Americana Fest.

20
00:00:39,851 --> 00:00:42,970
We're playing this festival and we were
driving under this bridge and there were

21
00:00:42,971 --> 00:00:46,990
these two guys beating the fuck out of
each other in the middle of the street.

22
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,760
It was like a bottle over the face.

23
00:00:48,761 --> 00:00:51,220
This one guy was choking
the other guy and anchor.

24
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:52,063
No,

25
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:52,601
terrible.

26
00:00:52,601 --> 00:00:53,500
It was sloppy.

27
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,550
It was sloppy.

28
00:00:54,551 --> 00:00:55,280
It was sloppy.

29
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,080
Crackhead,

30
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:56,913
bullshit.

31
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:58,750
Main puzzles.

32
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,413
It was like,

33
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:01,840
obviously we called the police,

34
00:01:01,841 --> 00:01:03,490
but like I had this
moment where I was like,

35
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:04,690
I wanted to do something.

36
00:01:04,691 --> 00:01:04,931
I'm like,

37
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:06,160
what the fuck can I do?

38
00:01:06,161 --> 00:01:08,390
And I was literally the leaned
out the window and I went stop.

39
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:11,470
I didn't know what to do.

40
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:12,310
And I called the police.

41
00:01:12,311 --> 00:01:14,150
But like if I were a new job,

42
00:01:14,151 --> 00:01:14,984
like you

43
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,890
definitely stayed in my car,

44
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:18,580
right?

45
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,413
100%

46
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,530
if you're driving by two people
beating the fuck out of each other,

47
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,420
you are not there.

48
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:29,683
Okay.

49
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,840
You were in a car just because
it's right in front of you.

50
00:01:34,841 --> 00:01:38,650
That shit could be a hundred
miles away in less and less.

51
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,280
There's someone in that
mixture that needs you.

52
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:46,150
Like if there's someone who's small
and they get beaten up by someone big,

53
00:01:46,151 --> 00:01:47,080
then everything changes.

54
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,630
But if it's too fucking dude
chill from the other day,

55
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,830
they're fighting in the street fucking
so my point is don't always stop.

56
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,100
Just kiss already.

57
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,180
Don't always stop.

58
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,820
Sometimes you get to elect two
dudes beat each of the day.

59
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,550
It's better for everybody.

60
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,320
Certain people,

61
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,573
it's fine.

62
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,980
Just give him both rocks
and push them near the edge.

63
00:02:11,981 --> 00:02:12,814
Go

64
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,160
let them fall and keep coal mining.

65
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,420
You got to keep moving.

66
00:02:19,421 --> 00:02:19,841
Okay.

67
00:02:19,841 --> 00:02:21,310
Genes need to flourish.

68
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:24,730
They need to find better
streams of diversity.

69
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:27,720
That's what I'm saying,

70
00:02:27,721 --> 00:02:28,554
man,

71
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,130
don't always stop fights.

72
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,400
And what I've realized is when they,

73
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,620
when they've recognize you as a threat,

74
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,660
when they identify you as
somebody who could do them damage,

75
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,960
they start going on maneuvers trying
to find out everything about it.

76
00:02:38,961 --> 00:02:41,610
You're trying to find out what the worst
stuff they have on you is so that he

77
00:02:41,611 --> 00:02:45,450
can dismiss you as a bigot or a
sexist or a Neo Nazi or whatever.

78
00:02:45,451 --> 00:02:48,690
They can come up with anything they can
grasp out because their strategy is to

79
00:02:48,691 --> 00:02:49,250
dismiss the,

80
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:53,190
is to dismiss the speaker by
attacking the speakers credibility.

81
00:02:53,191 --> 00:02:56,100
Because that way they never have to even
consider the merits of the argument.

82
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:56,790
Yes.

83
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,020
They haven't been able to do that with me.

84
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:58,620
Um,

85
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,180
which is why feminists
now refuse to bait me,

86
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,960
debate me on TV because
they know they'll lose.

87
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:02,561
Um,

88
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:03,041
they calm,

89
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:03,520
bring out,

90
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,540
well they can't bring out,

91
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:09,070
they've got this battery of dismissing
of a dismissal tactics that they've

92
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:12,220
amassed over the last 30 years and
they've got so complacent because they've

93
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:12,881
never had,

94
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:13,151
you know,

95
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,240
a Sassy gay person.

96
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:14,921
And come up and say it,

97
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:17,950
you're talking bullshit and you're
hurting men and here are the facts.

98
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:18,881
They've never had it before.

99
00:03:18,881 --> 00:03:20,530
So they've never built up
an arsenal to fight it.

100
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:21,340
Um,

101
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:21,581
you know,

102
00:03:21,581 --> 00:03:22,060
so this is,

103
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,570
this is why I went and while Cook I'll
keep winning because they don't really

104
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:29,170
know how to deal with an
argument on its own merits.

105
00:03:29,171 --> 00:03:29,951
And in any case,

106
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:31,000
of course the facts are on our side.

107
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:31,421
Well,

108
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:35,740
it's also this conversation that
we're having right now is about war.

109
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,060
You're saying winning and losing and
they're taking tactics and strategies to

110
00:03:40,061 --> 00:03:41,650
look up dirt on the opposition.

111
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,490
They're going,

112
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:43,181
they're treating.

113
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:43,781
This is,

114
00:03:43,781 --> 00:03:44,050
it's,

115
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:48,340
this is an ideological war is not a
debate about the facts of the issue.

116
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,160
And I think that's part of it because
the left has always seen this as a war.

117
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,510
And the gender warriors,

118
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:52,870
you know,

119
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,950
have always been warriors.

120
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,720
They've always seen
this in strategic terms.

121
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:56,830
I'm not sure.

122
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:00,760
People on Conservatives and naturally
more self effacing conservatives tend to

123
00:04:00,761 --> 00:04:01,481
be a little bit cool,

124
00:04:01,481 --> 00:04:03,840
a little bit more chill about things
they kind of don't really want to get of.

125
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:05,603
How do you explain?

126
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,770
I think they get very angry about things.

127
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:08,980
Ted Cruz,

128
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:09,461
what am I saying?

129
00:04:09,461 --> 00:04:10,211
Old Conservatives,

130
00:04:10,211 --> 00:04:11,050
but he explained,

131
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,040
what's her name?

132
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,820
Pailin chick.

133
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,540
Sarah Pailin.

134
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,231
How to explain that.

135
00:04:14,231 --> 00:04:14,590
These are the,

136
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:18,520
these are the outline is that even most
conservatives find these people a bit

137
00:04:18,521 --> 00:04:19,020
much.

138
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:19,480
How could be,

139
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,510
I think that guy's in his,

140
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:21,344
in the end.

141
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:24,850
Who knows how these much fatter
now he was hopping when last time.

142
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:25,751
I mean,

143
00:04:25,751 --> 00:04:26,081
you know,

144
00:04:26,081 --> 00:04:29,140
for like a lazy Christian TV gigs,

145
00:04:29,141 --> 00:04:30,760
so fat he got so far,

146
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:31,541
I cannot vote for anyone.

147
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:32,830
That phenomena of rock and rolling.

148
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,330
I Want Marco Rubio just because he's hot.

149
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:35,771
If we call out Trump,

150
00:04:35,771 --> 00:04:36,400
then I won't regret it.

151
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,270
I don't think.

152
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,550
I think people are silly.

153
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,090
So whether or not it's a conservative
thing or a liberal thing,

154
00:04:43,091 --> 00:04:47,110
I think there's a vast majority of people
that aren't not very good at looking

155
00:04:47,111 --> 00:04:47,944
at themselves.

156
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,950
And they're not very good at looking
at the momentum of their actions.

157
00:04:50,951 --> 00:04:53,390
They just think that they're right
because this is what they've,

158
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,180
they've been saying for so long.

159
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,600
And I think that's one of the most
horrific things about these conversations

160
00:04:58,601 --> 00:04:59,231
with these women.

161
00:04:59,231 --> 00:05:00,940
Get in with you about,

162
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,760
cause like when,

163
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:06,010
when they're talking about what
they think are social constructs,

164
00:05:06,011 --> 00:05:08,200
things like gender identities
and the way people be.

165
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,830
And when you shatter that with the facts,

166
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:16,530
they're looking for some other weapons
and there's nothing there or you see it

167
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,021
in their eyes.

168
00:05:17,021 --> 00:05:17,570
You know,

169
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:20,380
cause it's not really a
debate about the idea itself.

170
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,370
It's just not what,

171
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:21,731
it's not.

172
00:05:21,731 --> 00:05:22,990
What it's about is gender warfare.

173
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,720
That's why people like Christina Hoff
summers called them gender warriors

174
00:05:25,721 --> 00:05:28,900
because these aren't people who want
any kind of social justice as they say.

175
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,670
These are people who just hate men,

176
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:31,900
will just hate men.

177
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:32,940
They want to hurt men.

178
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:33,490
Um,

179
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,690
they don't want to quality for women.

180
00:05:34,691 --> 00:05:35,270
They want to,

181
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,430
they want superiority for women.

182
00:05:36,431 --> 00:05:40,230
Whether it's architected into
the education system or you know,

183
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,920
affirmative action or whatever it is.

184
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,000
They don't want quality.

185
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:43,930
They want superiority.

186
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,800
And fundamentally,

187
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:45,280
a lot of this,

188
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:45,521
you know,

189
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:45,820
these,

190
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,140
these crazy extremist,

191
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:47,940
you know,

192
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:48,400
uh,

193
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,630
progressive third wave feminists,

194
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:50,950
today's version of feminism.

195
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:54,250
It basically boils down to [inaudible]
and it takes a gay guy because it's so

196
00:05:54,251 --> 00:05:56,530
dangerous for men to even
broach this subject anymore.

197
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,200
And any man,

198
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,380
a mainstream job puts that at risk by
even talking on the subject no matter what

199
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:01,214
his opinion is.

200
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:01,700
Um,

201
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,960
it takes a gay guy to go on,

202
00:06:02,961 --> 00:06:03,201
you know,

203
00:06:03,201 --> 00:06:04,430
Sky News in the UK and say,

204
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:04,731
I'm sorry,

205
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:07,010
the facts are not on your side and
what you're doing is damaging to women.

206
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:07,550
Um,

207
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,870
it's to me really an indictment on a,

208
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:14,510
on debate in our public square that it
is so dangerous for a man to even express

209
00:06:14,511 --> 00:06:17,120
an opinion on this subject that it takes
a fact they're going to stick up for,

210
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:18,200
for heterosexuals.

211
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:23,850
If other men could say this,

212
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:24,421
they would be,

213
00:06:24,421 --> 00:06:26,670
but they can't because they would
run the risk of their careers.

214
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,010
Feminists always talking
about silencing the people.

215
00:06:29,011 --> 00:06:30,000
Icy silence to men,

216
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:30,690
but we don't,

217
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:34,140
there's no like established
number that everybody knows like,

218
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:34,351
oh,

219
00:06:34,351 --> 00:06:35,370
if you eat this,

220
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,710
you how many milligrams are you had 10 oh,

221
00:06:37,711 --> 00:06:38,544
you're fine.

222
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,830
There's because of the
fact that it's illegal.

223
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,600
There's all this guessing and you gotta.

224
00:06:42,601 --> 00:06:44,550
It takes a long time to figure it out.

225
00:06:44,551 --> 00:06:47,190
You've got to talk to a bunch of
different people and get answers.

226
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:52,220
Don't talk to Joey Diaz throwing off
the curve or don't worry about a cop

227
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:52,531
soccer.

228
00:06:52,531 --> 00:06:54,510
Even though the one you're
going to walk on ice,

229
00:06:54,511 --> 00:06:55,620
you might as well dance.

230
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:58,380
I saw him the other day
on periscope just eating.

231
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:58,831
He's like,

232
00:06:58,831 --> 00:06:59,131
all right,

233
00:06:59,131 --> 00:06:59,400
here,

234
00:06:59,400 --> 00:06:59,700
here,

235
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,180
here,

236
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:00,691
take this,

237
00:07:00,691 --> 00:07:01,111
and he's like,

238
00:07:01,111 --> 00:07:02,780
they're eating just tons of
edibles and then they're like,

239
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:03,051
all right,

240
00:07:03,051 --> 00:07:04,530
you [inaudible] you've never done acid.

241
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:04,830
Well,

242
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:08,490
open up your tongue here
and they just drop acid.

243
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:09,853
Eight ish.

244
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:10,650
Yeah.

245
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,000
Joey goes so deep.

246
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,600
He's not even experiencing reality as
we know it because reality is just very

247
00:07:17,911 --> 00:07:18,660
different right now.

248
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,291
Where to lead.

249
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:20,100
This guy's like,

250
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:20,251
oh,

251
00:07:20,251 --> 00:07:22,560
I guess ass eating that much as normal.

252
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:23,251
He enjoys it.

253
00:07:23,251 --> 00:07:24,790
He's turning him into a Jody is.

254
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:25,560
Yeah,

255
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,580
but listen man,

256
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,830
think about if you're Li,

257
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:28,810
right.

258
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:29,643
Nice kid.

259
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,960
Very smart guy.

260
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:32,520
He's a sweetheart.

261
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,720
Funny on the show.

262
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:38,520
And this fucker has stumbled into a
partnership with the funniest man that's

263
00:07:38,521 --> 00:07:39,354
ever lived.

264
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,310
So he has this podcast,

265
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,540
the funniest man that's ever lived.

266
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,070
What is the funniest
man that's ever lived?

267
00:07:44,071 --> 00:07:46,860
Do he doses them every day?

268
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,930
Joey Diaz doses that guy with
like 500 milligram Chiba Chews.

269
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:55,890
He'll take the wrapper off of a
fucking 200 milligram Chiba Chew,

270
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,790
put a 500 milligram in their
rapid wrap it handed to him,

271
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,290
eat a dog the mile,

272
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,380
the mile done line about the
fucking number two hundreds normal.

273
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:05,580
The line about the number,

274
00:08:05,581 --> 00:08:10,581
they say 200 get the fuck outta here to
Honda with your fucking faggy 200 I had

275
00:08:11,371 --> 00:08:13,590
like a 40 the other day
or something like that.

276
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,330
I was fucked up out of book.

277
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:20,660
I can't believe they let Lee
thinks 200 is a normal number,

278
00:08:20,671 --> 00:08:21,030
you know?

279
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:21,241
Yeah.

280
00:08:21,241 --> 00:08:22,320
Those guys go deep.

281
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:22,980
Yeah.

282
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,260
He had to death stars the other day too,

283
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,570
to death stars too.

284
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:30,300
I've never even heard of anybody
eating two of those things.

285
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,070
Do you ever heard of the death star?

286
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,511
Oh my God.

287
00:08:33,511 --> 00:08:33,990
Is it?

288
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:36,750
There's some fucking thing that
these guys in northern California,

289
00:08:36,751 --> 00:08:37,290
Maine,

290
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:39,510
I think the same guys who
make the gummy bears make the,

291
00:08:39,511 --> 00:08:39,601
uh,

292
00:08:39,601 --> 00:08:43,050
the death stars and they're
supposed to be so bad.

293
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,040
Joey was running,

294
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,610
trying to give one to Alex Jones
last time we were in Austin together.

295
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:48,421
Where's Alex Jones?

296
00:08:48,421 --> 00:08:49,780
I got to get him one of these desktops.

297
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:50,663
Joe Rogan.

298
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,380
I'm going to get them
one of these desktops.

299
00:08:52,381 --> 00:08:53,550
I'm gonna fuck him up.

300
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,070
Last time he had like a of bread

301
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,060
gummy where he was cutting
slices for amazing.

302
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,580
I gotta make slice you off on and

303
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:03,541

304
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,070

305
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:05,431
Hey,

306
00:09:05,431 --> 00:09:06,151
you got to try this.

307
00:09:06,151 --> 00:09:06,984
No pressure.

308
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:08,550
I got this new pursued.

309
00:09:08,551 --> 00:09:11,430
All this fucking guy knows

310
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:21,540
Okay.
