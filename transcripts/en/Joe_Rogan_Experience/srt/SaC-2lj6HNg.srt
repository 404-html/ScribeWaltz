1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,590
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:02,400
Um,

3
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:02,791
so,

4
00:00:02,791 --> 00:00:03,210
uh,

5
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:07,950
you and you were married at the time and
you were getting divorced while we were

6
00:00:07,951 --> 00:00:08,784
doing the show.

7
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:09,500
And,

8
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:09,810
uh,

9
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:14,130
it was one of the craziest things I've
ever seen in my life and not just to Phil

10
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:14,821
Hartman divorce thing,

11
00:00:14,821 --> 00:00:15,061
you know,

12
00:00:15,061 --> 00:00:15,511
scared me.

13
00:00:15,511 --> 00:00:16,770
But Dave thinks carried me.

14
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,550
And one of the reasons why Dave scenes
things scared me was you do not want to

15
00:00:20,551 --> 00:00:25,230
get fucking married in Canada
because when you break up in Canada,

16
00:00:25,231 --> 00:00:26,820
say you decide you want to get a divorce,

17
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,110
you can't legally get divorced
until you're separate for a year,

18
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:31,801
right?

19
00:00:31,801 --> 00:00:32,520
That's correct.

20
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,160
I'm not sure.

21
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,110
I can't even remember.

22
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,200
I believe it was a year.

23
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:39,540
It's tattooed in my brain because I
remember thinking how crazy this was that

24
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:40,650
you were fucked.

25
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,420
And what was happening was his wife,

26
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,350
his first wife,

27
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:43,650
uh,

28
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:44,000
was,

29
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,520
uh,

30
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,020
at Accenture character and she decided
to start taking this shit all over the

31
00:00:49,021 --> 00:00:49,741
fucking world,

32
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:51,330
or a content on the radio.

33
00:00:51,331 --> 00:00:52,164
I would have gone with that.

34
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:52,801
But you know,

35
00:00:52,801 --> 00:00:53,870
you're a great guy and I want to say,

36
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:55,440
yeah,

37
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,700
well she's the mother of your children.

38
00:00:56,701 --> 00:00:57,520
So yeah,

39
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,490
that doesn't excuse that.

40
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:02,350
Does that is not a get out
of get out of countries.

41
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:05,521
Well,

42
00:01:05,521 --> 00:01:05,820
uh,

43
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,880
she was very odd and uh,

44
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:08,271
the,

45
00:01:08,271 --> 00:01:11,700
the first season the guys were together
and then I believe by the second season

46
00:01:11,701 --> 00:01:12,534
it was over.

47
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:13,010
Yeah,

48
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:13,590
yeah,

49
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:13,741
yeah.

50
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:13,771
It,

51
00:01:13,771 --> 00:01:14,604
we split up.

52
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,530
And so she started,

53
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,750
what she would do is spend all days money.

54
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,400
So Dave would be working
and she would spend all day,

55
00:01:21,401 --> 00:01:22,110
it's money,

56
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:27,000
I mean by crazy expensive furniture
fly all around the world all the time.

57
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,650
So whenever Dave wanted to see his kids,

58
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,720
he used to have to get
fucking malaria shots.

59
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:31,200
Yeah.

60
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:31,770
Okay.

61
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,880
So one time we were at one of these NBC
things and Dave's fucked up on malaria

62
00:01:35,881 --> 00:01:39,120
medication and gin and tonics or
whatever the fuck you were drinking.

63
00:01:39,121 --> 00:01:39,510
Yeah.

64
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,250
And you get like,

65
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:42,540
like crazy.

66
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:45,480
I had to stop Dave from beating a guy up.

67
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,430
I had to step in between.

68
00:01:47,431 --> 00:01:50,350
Do you remember the big guy with the
long hair with the fucking dawn Jovi's

69
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,243
Tony.

70
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,313
Yeah,

71
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:52,951
Tony Carry.

72
00:01:52,951 --> 00:01:53,784
It wasn't,

73
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,310
it wasn't that the guy
had done anything wrong.

74
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,290
It was just the malaria medication.

75
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,580
You become a psychotic,

76
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,060
it's a very common uh,

77
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:01,913
effect.

78
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,140
Especially apparently when
you mix it with alcohol.

79
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:04,960
Yeah.

80
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,141
Well,

81
00:02:05,141 --> 00:02:05,400
and you,

82
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,650
and then you added that having
made two trips to Africa.

83
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,010
Yeah.

84
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:09,510
Month.

85
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:10,343
Yes.

86
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:12,370
Africa to see his fucking kids.

87
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,450
Like I had to fly to,

88
00:02:13,451 --> 00:02:18,280
I had to fly to Morocco at Thanksgiving
and so we had two weeks off of it.

89
00:02:18,281 --> 00:02:19,114
So I had floated,

90
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,433
flew to uh,

91
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,270
and this again.

92
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:21,790
And she,

93
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:22,630
when we first separated,

94
00:02:22,631 --> 00:02:23,420
she took the kids,

95
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,680
we just said we'd like a summer sent
mom divorce where it was like I need to

96
00:02:26,681 --> 00:02:29,110
take the children to the
continent and gather my thoughts.

97
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,300
So she like traveled through Europe with,

98
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,080
you know,

99
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,090
a six month old baby and a two year,

100
00:02:34,091 --> 00:02:36,010
two and a half year old for six months.

101
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:36,941
And then,

102
00:02:36,941 --> 00:02:39,130
so then Thanksgiving there and Morocco.

103
00:02:39,131 --> 00:02:40,720
So I had to go meet him in Morocco.

104
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,730
So I get to spend 10 days in Morocco,

105
00:02:42,731 --> 00:02:45,310
then another 24 hours flying back.

106
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,740
And then two weeks later
we get our Christmas break.

107
00:02:47,741 --> 00:02:52,720
So I have to fly to Zimbabwe and there
was nothing you could've done like taking

108
00:02:52,721 --> 00:02:53,381
your money and you're like,

109
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:53,561
Hey,

110
00:02:53,561 --> 00:02:55,380
I'm giving it to Joe
or something like that.

111
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:55,760
No,

112
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,760
it was like a old money.

113
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:58,340
Yeah,

114
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,510
no have to,

115
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,210
you're responsible for taking care of
their wellbeing at the time when I like

116
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,480
when I made her get into therapy,

117
00:03:04,481 --> 00:03:04,990
she's,

118
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:05,590
uh,

119
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,930
like I forced her to get us
to get into couple's therapy

120
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:08,890
cause I was miserable.

121
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,203
Um,

122
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,313
and,

123
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:12,603
and so since we got,

124
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,300
I'd say,

125
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:13,961
let's go to therapy.

126
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:14,111
She said,

127
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:14,201
well,

128
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:15,190
I've got to go first.

129
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:16,390
All right,

130
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,990
you can go see the
therapist at the traffic.

131
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,700
Yeah.

132
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,420
So she goes in and explains to the
therapist that I'm an abusive husband,

133
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:23,710
uh,

134
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,190
you know,

135
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,430
and then she starts pulling any,

136
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:26,531
excuse me,

137
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:27,610
being physically abusive.

138
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:28,840
Uh,

139
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,400
and then she starts like phoning my
family and friends and saying that

140
00:03:33,401 --> 00:03:36,070
physically abusive or
complete fabrications.

141
00:03:36,071 --> 00:03:36,281
Right.

142
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:38,350
So she's just creating stories.

143
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,220
A good friend of mine,

144
00:03:39,221 --> 00:03:40,054
Steve,

145
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,500
when he heard this said,

146
00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:42,131
that's crazy.

147
00:03:42,131 --> 00:03:42,340
If,

148
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,810
if Dave was abusive,

149
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,070
she would be dead.

150
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,310
You know,

151
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:49,931
but no,

152
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:52,030
but then I go into therapy
and the therapist goes,

153
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:52,300
you know,

154
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,910
who is prepared for this
abusive husband and to walk in.

155
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,040
And she goes,

156
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,470
it was,

157
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,271
and she explained to me later,

158
00:03:57,271 --> 00:04:00,220
she said it was very weird because
you walked in and you didn't match the

159
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:01,840
description of you at all.

160
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,730
And it's just said when you walked in yet.

161
00:04:03,731 --> 00:04:05,020
And I saw you two together,

162
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,320
I immediately realized that if
anyone in this couple was abused,

163
00:04:08,321 --> 00:04:08,830
it was,

164
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:09,663
it was,

165
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:10,660
it was me.

166
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:12,850
Did the therapist say this to her?

167
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:13,691
Uh,

168
00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:15,670
I don't know if she ever
said it to her in therapy.

169
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,470
Did you have a one on one with the third?

170
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:18,420
I have one on one with it.

171
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:18,691
We have,

172
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:20,740
we both saw her individually and together.

173
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:21,850
And then after,

174
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,800
uh,

175
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,190
about six months of therapy,

176
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,090
uh,

177
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:25,750
my wife,

178
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,583
uh,

179
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,810
when I thought things were
starting to get better cause I was,

180
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,200
I was able to do things like
go CD shopping with Steve,

181
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:33,161
uh,

182
00:04:33,161 --> 00:04:33,740
without getting,

183
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,800
without that being a huge
fight when I got home,

184
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,293
you know,

185
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:37,900
you know,

186
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,711
so that was like,

187
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:38,950
I thought,

188
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:39,251
oh,

189
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:40,720
I'm a little bit of freedom here.

190
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,220
I can go out and hang out with,

191
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,190
hang out with my friends for a little
bit without there being a huge fight.

192
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,870
And uh,

193
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:52,140
but then she was diagnosed as having
borderline personality disorder by our

194
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,501
therapy.

195
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:55,770
That exactly mean why is it
borderline personality disorder?

196
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:56,830
It's a misnomer.

197
00:04:56,831 --> 00:04:57,730
Really don't like it.

198
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,540
They used to,

199
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,960
they used to think it was because it
was a condition that bordered on being

200
00:05:01,961 --> 00:05:02,830
psychotic.

201
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,713
Um,

202
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:05,441
and now it's,

203
00:05:05,441 --> 00:05:06,274
they,

204
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,600
they know that isn't the condition.

205
00:05:07,601 --> 00:05:09,310
It's not anything to do with psychosis.

206
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,340
But the name has stuck.

207
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,000
The problem with my problem with the name
is when you say borderline personality

208
00:05:16,001 --> 00:05:16,630
disorder,

209
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,700
do you have a fucking
personality disorder or not?

210
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,900
What is borderline?

211
00:05:19,901 --> 00:05:21,350
You're kind of weird kind of.

212
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,160
Cause in fact borderline's
a lot of therapists when
even treat them cause they,

213
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,350
they think they're just impossible to
treat and that they're horrible people to

214
00:05:29,351 --> 00:05:30,184
deal with.

215
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,320
You know that they're
incredibly dishonest.

216
00:05:32,321 --> 00:05:33,730
The pathological liars.

217
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,450
How do you define it though?

218
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:38,230
How can you define certain
sets of mental illness?

219
00:05:38,231 --> 00:05:40,960
I mean who was it a judgment call?

220
00:05:40,961 --> 00:05:41,620
There's like a,

221
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,910
was the Dsm,

222
00:05:42,911 --> 00:05:43,721
is that what it's called?

223
00:05:43,721 --> 00:05:46,960
The diagnostic standards
manual or something like that.

224
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,830
And it's got like a checklist and
if you score a certain number on the

225
00:05:50,831 --> 00:05:51,371
checklist,

226
00:05:51,371 --> 00:05:51,611
they go,

227
00:05:51,611 --> 00:05:52,810
that's a diagnosis.

228
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:53,861
And I think,

229
00:05:53,861 --> 00:05:54,970
uh,

230
00:05:55,630 --> 00:06:00,350
she had like nine at a 10 on
the checklist for borderline.

231
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,120
Was she always this way or did she change?

232
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,230
She was always that way.

233
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:04,461
Yeah.

234
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:06,320
Like basically as soon
as we became a couple,

235
00:06:06,321 --> 00:06:07,190
like before we were a couple,

236
00:06:07,191 --> 00:06:08,024
she was like my,

237
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,223
um,

238
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,021
before she did,

239
00:06:10,021 --> 00:06:11,510
she was my best friend's girlfriend.

240
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,560
Oh Shit.

241
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:12,891
You know,

242
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:13,790
it's Karma son.

243
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:14,210
Yeah.

244
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,010
That's what happened.

245
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:15,590
You know,

246
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,060
you got hooked up with Karma.

247
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,610
It was like one of these
things where it's like,

248
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,250
did she break up with him first and
then go out with you or you can,

249
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:22,430
no,

250
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:22,701
no.

251
00:06:22,701 --> 00:06:24,080
It was like one of these
things where I sort of said,

252
00:06:24,081 --> 00:06:24,261
look,

253
00:06:24,261 --> 00:06:24,490
I,

254
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:24,710
you know,

255
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:27,020
we should stop hanging
out so much cause I'm,

256
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:27,854
you know,

257
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,420
I was like feeling bad about it.

258
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:34,670
I was like 20 years old and at that point
kind of lonely and desperate and said,

259
00:06:35,301 --> 00:06:35,451
look,

260
00:06:35,451 --> 00:06:38,030
I've got these feelings and we should
stop hanging out together alone.

261
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:38,361
Really?

262
00:06:38,361 --> 00:06:41,030
You actually said I have these feelings
and we should stop hanging out.

263
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:41,270
Yeah.

264
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,150
How many guys will do that?

265
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:43,760
Very few.

266
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,180
Yeah.

267
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:44,701
And her,

268
00:06:44,701 --> 00:06:46,250
her reaction to that was the,

269
00:06:46,251 --> 00:06:47,290
the uh,

270
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,250
she just showed me her tits
and started kissing me.

271
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,210
So it was like,

272
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:50,691
oh,

273
00:06:50,691 --> 00:06:51,524
all right,

274
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,580
all I tried,

275
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,990
you did give it your best.

276
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:55,851
So,

277
00:06:55,851 --> 00:06:56,330
um,

278
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,460
so what happens then you
go to the buddy and go,

279
00:06:58,461 --> 00:06:59,294
hey bro,

280
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:00,980
fuck your girlfriend.

281
00:07:00,981 --> 00:07:01,220
Hey.

282
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:01,421
Yeah.

283
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:01,550
Well,

284
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,080
I tried to cool it,

285
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:07,760
tried to get out of it and I even was
out of town for a while and tried to stay

286
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:08,391
away from it.

287
00:07:08,391 --> 00:07:09,440
But um,

288
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:10,250
you know,

289
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,540
he was probably like thank God,

290
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,070
thank God.

291
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:12,500
Yeah.

292
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,520
Well that's the thing is I didn't realize
at the time cause I gotten gone all

293
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,100
right.

294
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,340
I thought things were
okay with them and uh,

295
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:20,540
and I,

296
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:20,781
you know,

297
00:07:20,781 --> 00:07:22,670
and it wasn't til she
and I hooked up like,

298
00:07:22,671 --> 00:07:23,061
cause again,

299
00:07:23,061 --> 00:07:25,760
as soon as we hook cause
borderlines when they love you,

300
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:26,900
you're the most beautiful,

301
00:07:26,901 --> 00:07:28,220
perfect thing in the world.

302
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,473
But then,

303
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,313
uh,

304
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,540
but then after that,

305
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,770
like if anything is wrong,

306
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,480
then you suddenly become the most evil,

307
00:07:35,481 --> 00:07:35,781
dark,

308
00:07:35,781 --> 00:07:38,210
horrible thing in the
world and they can't,

309
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,010
they can't see the two at the same time,

310
00:07:40,011 --> 00:07:42,350
they can't see your flaws and your,

311
00:07:42,351 --> 00:07:43,460
and your virtues.

312
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,480
How do the same time,

313
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,111
wow.

314
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:46,250
I think I've dated somebody.

315
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,440
Every girl you remember that you'd like,

316
00:07:48,441 --> 00:07:48,981
man,

317
00:07:48,981 --> 00:07:50,390
I need to write this fucking guy.

318
00:07:50,391 --> 00:07:51,081
You don't even know.

319
00:07:51,081 --> 00:07:53,390
He just got out of a relationship
with a penthouse pet of the year.

320
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,171
Oh real it,

321
00:07:54,171 --> 00:07:55,910
it was wonderful for me.

322
00:07:55,911 --> 00:07:57,960
It was like I had my
own soap opera going on,

323
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,140
but it was also just like this where,

324
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:00,561
where,

325
00:08:00,561 --> 00:08:01,610
when Shit went down,

326
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:02,444
it was,

327
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,440
it was on or off.

328
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,250
It was no like,

329
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:04,401
oh,

330
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,061
shits down.

331
00:08:05,061 --> 00:08:06,590
Maybe we can work through this.

332
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,221
It was just,

333
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:09,680
that's one of the key
signals of a borderline,

334
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:10,340
uh,

335
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:10,791
is that,

336
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:11,541
that in the,

337
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:15,080
they say it's the inability to recognize
the good and bad and the same person,

338
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,280
you know,

339
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,890
you can shift from being the most
evil person to the greatest person.

340
00:08:18,891 --> 00:08:19,880
I 100%.

341
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,420
Yeah.

342
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,510
So with my first wife
before we were a couple,

343
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,650
when it was just,

344
00:08:24,651 --> 00:08:25,220
you know,

345
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,060
uh,

346
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:26,810
elicit,

347
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:27,171
you know,

348
00:08:27,171 --> 00:08:29,030
when it was like this secret feelings,

349
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:29,631
uh,

350
00:08:29,631 --> 00:08:29,901
you know,

351
00:08:29,901 --> 00:08:30,241
a movie,

352
00:08:30,241 --> 00:08:30,950
we're friends,

353
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,160
I was the greatest guy he was,

354
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:34,340
and she made me feel like I
was the greatest guy on earth.

355
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,610
So you thought this is
the perfect woman for me,

356
00:08:36,611 --> 00:08:38,000
even know she's with my friend.

357
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,953
You know,

358
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,633
they do.

359
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,163
Yeah.

360
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:43,003
And then,

361
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:47,450
but as soon as we became a couple first
thing that like sex gone immediately and

362
00:08:47,451 --> 00:08:49,250
we didn't have sex for 11 years.

363
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:53,330
We were together for 11 years and
we'd have sex maybe once a year.

364
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,620
Oh my God.

365
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:55,830
How did you two kids?

366
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:56,340
Uh,

367
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,173
once a year.

368
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,940
Really I have very motel sperm.

369
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,463
Um,

370
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,460
Holy Shit.

371
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,980
We had kids cause she decided
she wanted to get pregnant and,

372
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,200
and even at that point that,

373
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,700
oh well at least we'll get laid,

374
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:09,983
you know.

375
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,823
And uh,

376
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,930
what were your friends
while this was all going on?

377
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,140
Well,

378
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,700
what men friends always do.

379
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,620
It depends on the men friends.

380
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:17,850
They never say anything.

381
00:09:17,851 --> 00:09:20,160
They just sit there and
quietly eight and hate her,

382
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:20,881
not me,

383
00:09:20,881 --> 00:09:21,320
man.

384
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:21,720
Yeah.

385
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,120
I've learned from the
Phil Hartman experience,

386
00:09:24,121 --> 00:09:25,050
I tell people.

387
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,470
Yeah.

388
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,660
And whenever I think that my
friends in a bad situation,

389
00:09:27,661 --> 00:09:27,811
I,

390
00:09:27,811 --> 00:09:28,081
I'll,

391
00:09:28,081 --> 00:09:29,160
I will pull them aside.

392
00:09:29,161 --> 00:09:29,371
I've,

393
00:09:29,371 --> 00:09:29,941
I've offered,

394
00:09:29,941 --> 00:09:30,660
which is on risk.

395
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,710
You should take for a friend.

396
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,140
Yeah.

397
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,600
I've had friends stay at my house.

398
00:09:33,601 --> 00:09:36,300
Dunkin stayed at my house for
a few months after he got out.

399
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,111
You know,

400
00:09:37,111 --> 00:09:38,340
you've got to tell people like,

401
00:09:38,341 --> 00:09:38,670
Bro,

402
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,061
this is,

403
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:42,540
you're stuck and you think for some reason
or that this person is a part of your

404
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:43,110
life,

405
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:44,040
they are not,

406
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:44,701
this is,

407
00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:47,250
this is a show that you're tuning
into that you should shut off.

408
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:47,730
Yeah.

409
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:48,040
Okay.

410
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,331
For me,

411
00:09:48,331 --> 00:09:49,051
it was like this,

412
00:09:49,051 --> 00:09:51,150
a lot of guilt about
how we started course.

413
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,050
And then eventually,

414
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:52,883
eventually,

415
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:53,491
you know,

416
00:09:53,491 --> 00:09:54,050
I'm gonna,

417
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:54,330
you know,

418
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:57,420
I'm almost as crazy as she is
after 11 years of no fucking,

419
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,850
your brain doesn't function properly,

420
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:00,840
you know,

421
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,970
and it's also 11 years
of like twice a month,

422
00:10:02,971 --> 00:10:04,050
suicide threats,

423
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,580
you know,

424
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,413
uh,

425
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,241
you know,

426
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:09,710
and then,

427
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:09,960
you know,

428
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,201
then I,

429
00:10:10,201 --> 00:10:10,471
you know,

430
00:10:10,471 --> 00:10:11,850
I got to the point where I was so crazy,

431
00:10:11,851 --> 00:10:12,091
I thought,

432
00:10:12,091 --> 00:10:12,361
well,

433
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:12,601
hey,

434
00:10:12,601 --> 00:10:13,830
at least if we have a kid,

435
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,570
you know,

436
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:15,181
if we have a kid,

437
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:16,770
she won't kill herself when I leave.

438
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,263
You know?

439
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,400
And that's how crazy.

440
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,393
And literally,

441
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:25,980
within less than a month
after my son was born,

442
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,223
uh,

443
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,171
out of nowhere,

444
00:10:28,171 --> 00:10:28,471
she goes,

445
00:10:28,471 --> 00:10:28,591
you know,

446
00:10:28,591 --> 00:10:29,640
I've been thinking about it.

447
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,560
And I think if you left me,

448
00:10:31,561 --> 00:10:32,850
even with a baby,

449
00:10:32,851 --> 00:10:33,870
I would still kill myself.

450
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:35,040
I was like,

451
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,873
she could read my mind.

452
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:36,810
Whoa.

453
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,100
I've been thinking about it.

454
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,780
Holy Shit.

455
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:40,201
And was like,

456
00:10:40,201 --> 00:10:41,100
Oh really?

457
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,750
I have a look.

458
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,860
At that time I was like,

459
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,080
when tabs and I split up,

460
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,850
she was going through
about 50 grand a month.

461
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,100
Damn it's,

462
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,190
and that was before we had it.

463
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,950
That was before we had like
a separation agreement.

464
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,480
Half a million a year.

465
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:54,990
Yeah.

466
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:55,890
Oh my God.

467
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,281
Running,

468
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:56,881
spending it.

469
00:10:56,881 --> 00:10:59,100
And you have to make a million
to spend a half a million.

470
00:10:59,130 --> 00:10:59,730
Yeah.

471
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:00,480
Yeah.

472
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,640
She's been so fun.

473
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,390
She was renovating the house
constantly to be heard,

474
00:11:05,391 --> 00:11:10,391
to be heard and that she rescate re
lance had the backyard re landscape twice

475
00:11:11,431 --> 00:11:13,800
cause she decided she didn't
like where the Koi pond was.

476
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,060
Oh my God.

477
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,090
You know that's like,

478
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,670
you know,

479
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,290
core core ponds are pretty awesome though.

480
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:19,880
Yeah.

481
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,170
That's one thing I've always thought
about killing whenever we get around to

482
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:22,670
lead.

483
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,160
That's nice.

484
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:23,371
You know,

485
00:11:23,371 --> 00:11:26,710
like you can't really raise a child in
a healthy home without a collective.

486
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:27,570
That was at our argument,

487
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:28,861
our argument.

488
00:11:28,861 --> 00:11:29,970
And he was all for the kids.

489
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:30,451
Yeah.

490
00:11:30,451 --> 00:11:31,710
The kids need a Koi pond.

491
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,970
Kids need to go to Morocco.

492
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,833
Yeah,

493
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,370
worry about getting bitten by a
poisonous insects to turn like the third.

494
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,850
She kept renovate this house,

495
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,800
like at least spent like another,

496
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,320
like a half a million dollars
renovating a fully renovated house.

497
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,300
Well this is why I brought this up.

498
00:11:45,301 --> 00:11:47,310
So I ran into you on Twitter.

499
00:11:47,311 --> 00:11:50,580
I saw you on Twitter and one of the
first things I saw you on Twitter was you

500
00:11:50,581 --> 00:11:52,650
talking about how you had just gotten,

501
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:53,110
uh,

502
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,461
the,

503
00:11:53,461 --> 00:11:58,461
the court had just told you you have to
pay three times your monthly salary in

504
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,463
alimony.

505
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:00,441
And again,

506
00:12:00,441 --> 00:12:01,121
it's two times slept,

507
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:04,720
but I would say as an average because
a lot of months I don't have a salary.

508
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:05,410
Uh,

509
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:05,561
no.

510
00:12:05,561 --> 00:12:05,671
I,

511
00:12:05,671 --> 00:12:05,861
yeah,

512
00:12:05,861 --> 00:12:06,540
they ordered,

513
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,090
uh,

514
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:12,090
I had to pay $17,700 a month or go to
jail for 10 days every month that I'm late

515
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,570
without warning.

516
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:16,840
That's,

517
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,450
that was the 10th the judge's
ruling jail for 10 days.

518
00:12:19,451 --> 00:12:22,000
So do you have to bit
be exported to Canada?

519
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:22,530
Is that what it,

520
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:22,781
well,

521
00:12:22,781 --> 00:12:23,411
that's the thing.

522
00:12:23,411 --> 00:12:24,220
I'm here,

523
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,053
so,

524
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:25,961
so do you know,

525
00:12:25,961 --> 00:12:26,711
say fuck you,

526
00:12:26,711 --> 00:12:28,270
I live here now and just stay here,

527
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:28,660
but I,

528
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:28,841
yeah,

529
00:12:28,841 --> 00:12:30,280
I can't risk going back to Canada.

530
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,181
You go to jail.

531
00:12:31,181 --> 00:12:31,570
Yeah.

532
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:32,403
Whoa.

533
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,200
So unless I've come up with 17,000,

534
00:12:35,201 --> 00:12:36,130
$700,

535
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:39,780
which in a month where I haven't earned
anything is a little hard to do that.

536
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,520
So how much are you sending over there?

537
00:12:41,521 --> 00:12:42,780
Are you trying to like whatever?

538
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:47,450
Like I sent five grand this past
month and this should go crazy.

539
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:49,570
It's 20 grand in November.

540
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,120
Did she go crazy and yell
at you like you need more?

541
00:12:52,121 --> 00:12:52,860
And I need that.

542
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,130
She hasn't talked to me directly,

543
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:54,760
you know,

544
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,960
really it's all through lawyers.

545
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,130
But again,

546
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,390
they were trying,

547
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:58,870
uh,

548
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:03,130
through this organization called the
fro the family responsibility office in

549
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,590
Ontario that,

550
00:13:05,591 --> 00:13:05,971
and this,

551
00:13:05,971 --> 00:13:10,971
this legal office is really responsible
for hounding a lot of men to their

552
00:13:11,321 --> 00:13:12,154
death.

553
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,440
Like there's a real problem with
like people committing suicide,

554
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:15,730
um,

555
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,130
after being prosecuted by these people.

556
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,271
And,

557
00:13:19,271 --> 00:13:20,104
uh,

558
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:20,981
they,

559
00:13:20,981 --> 00:13:21,520
uh,

560
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,770
they were trying to get
me like in November,

561
00:13:23,771 --> 00:13:25,900
I've sitting in a court
in like November 20th,

562
00:13:25,901 --> 00:13:26,734
I guess,

563
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,350
sitting in court and thinking
at the end of that day,

564
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:31,180
I might go to jail for six months.

565
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:32,050
They were,

566
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:34,180
they were pushing for me to
go to jail for six months.

567
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:36,010
This is what the fro is asking,

568
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:37,600
six month jail sentence.

569
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,060
If I didn't come up with
half $1 million that day,

570
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,273
um,

571
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,360
and an additional 30 days for every month,

572
00:13:46,361 --> 00:13:47,380
I didn't come up with the money.

573
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:49,743
Oh my God.

574
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,440
So,

575
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,161
and I was sitting there going,

576
00:13:51,161 --> 00:13:51,311
well,

577
00:13:51,311 --> 00:13:51,790
the judge,

578
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:52,750
if he goes for it,

579
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,980
I in jail for life,

580
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:58,210
they'll cuff me there that day to God.

581
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,620
And I'll go to jail for six months.

582
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:00,401
The end of six months,

583
00:14:00,401 --> 00:14:01,180
they'll say,

584
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,013
you know,

585
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:02,230
well,

586
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:03,700
do you have the half million dollars?

587
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,750
And plus the ongoing money that
would accrue over the six months.

588
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:08,651
And I'd say,

589
00:14:08,651 --> 00:14:09,101
no,

590
00:14:09,101 --> 00:14:10,450
I've been in jail for six months.

591
00:14:10,451 --> 00:14:11,920
How was I supposed to earn any money?

592
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:12,251
All right,

593
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:13,300
that's another 30 days.

594
00:14:13,301 --> 00:14:15,160
The end of that 30 days you got the money.

595
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:15,521
No,

596
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,360
I been in jail.

597
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,800
So it's essentially a life sentence.

598
00:14:17,801 --> 00:14:20,110
Unless someone gives you $500,000.

599
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:20,680
Yeah.

600
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,100
How long?

601
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:21,581
How long,

602
00:14:21,581 --> 00:14:23,620
how much longer do you have for this?

603
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:24,461
Uh,

604
00:14:24,461 --> 00:14:25,110
well,

605
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:25,631
it's really,

606
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:25,880
it's,

607
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,390
I'm ending until I pay off the arrears,

608
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:29,920
that io or,

609
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:30,790
you know,

610
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:31,990
and that's crazy.

611
00:14:31,991 --> 00:14:33,580
And then until the kids are,

612
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,733
uh,

613
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,790
22 if they stay in school,

614
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:37,930
so,

615
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:40,210
and the skin and so then the
money just keeps adding up.

616
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,510
And you know,

617
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,850
my Dick off tonight?

618
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:43,211
Yeah.

619
00:14:43,211 --> 00:14:43,390
Like,

620
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:43,750
I mean,

621
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:43,960
don't,

622
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,201
you know,

623
00:14:44,201 --> 00:14:45,520
just don't marry Canadian shirk.

624
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:45,821
Yeah.

625
00:14:45,821 --> 00:14:46,120
I mean,

626
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,100
in order to pay $17,700,

627
00:14:48,101 --> 00:14:51,040
I have to earn about $40,000
in a month just to pay that.

628
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,321
Just,

629
00:14:51,321 --> 00:14:52,100
you know,

630
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:52,521
you know,

631
00:14:52,521 --> 00:14:53,060
with,

632
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:53,301
you know,

633
00:14:53,301 --> 00:14:54,230
20% commission,

634
00:14:54,231 --> 00:14:56,240
35% tax bracket,

635
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,680
um,

636
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:58,371
you know,

637
00:14:58,371 --> 00:15:01,580
so I've got to earn 40,000
just to have $0 million.

638
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,990
Fuck.

639
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,460
And it's just,

640
00:15:04,461 --> 00:15:05,870
it's so close to someone you hate.

641
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:06,570
Yeah.

642
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:07,310
Yeah.

643
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,990
And he didn't fuck me for 11 years.

644
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,050
Tell called crazy ass laws.

645
00:15:13,051 --> 00:15:15,770
And then when you tell them that you
don't make that much money anymore,

646
00:15:15,771 --> 00:15:19,880
what do they say to the judge pat who
made this ruling because they were,

647
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,200
I asked you for this six months.

648
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,033
Right?

649
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,470
And the judge kept saying
to the fro attorney,

650
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:25,730
uh,

651
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:26,780
you know,

652
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,690
give me another option
because I'm looking at,

653
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,860
I'm looking at the,

654
00:15:30,861 --> 00:15:31,310
the,

655
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:35,210
the financial documents and
I'm seeing where all the money,

656
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:38,360
all the money that has come in and
I'm seeing where it's all gone.

657
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:39,980
It's all here in this documents,

658
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,230
all the money that's come
in and where it's all gone.

659
00:15:42,231 --> 00:15:43,790
I can see it all in these documents.

660
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,340
So I am convinced that there isn't a
half a million dollars from Mr. Foley to

661
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,280
come up with today.

662
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:52,400
So if you insist on that ruling,

663
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:56,180
then I would send them to jail and
your client will never see another dime

664
00:15:56,181 --> 00:15:58,190
because Mister Foley's
career will be over.

665
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,870
And that's it.

666
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:00,501
And he kept saying,

667
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:05,501
give me an option that will get your
client some money and the Fr or refused.

668
00:16:06,461 --> 00:16:06,681
They said,

669
00:16:06,681 --> 00:16:06,771
well,

670
00:16:06,771 --> 00:16:08,420
we don't have the
authority from our client,

671
00:16:08,421 --> 00:16:09,320
my ex wife,

672
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,060
to make any other offer.

673
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:12,703
Um,

674
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,510
so for about two hours,

675
00:16:14,511 --> 00:16:17,420
the judge kept asking them
to come up with another.

676
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,320
So all this time while
you're sitting there,

677
00:16:19,321 --> 00:16:19,650
you're going,

678
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:20,520
I'm going to jail.

679
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:20,910
Yeah.

680
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:23,370
And I might be going to
jail essentially forever.

681
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,150
Yeah.

682
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:24,983
Yeah.

683
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:25,600
What happened?

684
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,100
Going to jail for being for the
crime of not earning $1 million.

685
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:29,880
Oh my God.

686
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,130
So what happens if that
actually does happen?

687
00:16:32,131 --> 00:16:32,370
I mean,

688
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:36,360
we have guys gone in jail with a large
sum like that and never come out.

689
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,320
I don't know.

690
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,270
But people have definitely
gone to jail and,

691
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,650
and definitely there's a lot of people
who have been looking at jail time who

692
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,710
have just killed themselves.

693
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,410
Uh,

694
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:45,570
you know,

695
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:45,900
can,

696
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,490
can you get the kids and then have him
stay with you so that she has the towel?

697
00:16:49,491 --> 00:16:50,130
Vone bro.

698
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:50,963
It's alimony.

699
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:51,301
Well,

700
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:51,541
there's no,

701
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:52,291
this is child support.

702
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:53,010
It's all child support.

703
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,030
This is all child support.

704
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,590
The kids thousand a
month in child support.

705
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,453
Yeah.

706
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,600
Steal the kids.

707
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,310
What the fuck are your kids eating?

708
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:06,820
A $17,000 iPhone or eating I iPhones.

709
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:07,950
Yeah.

710
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:08,970
It's incredible.

711
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:09,840
Yeah.

712
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,960
17 $17,700 a month.

713
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:14,461
That's crazy.

714
00:17:14,461 --> 00:17:15,240
Block.

715
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:15,421
Yeah.

716
00:17:15,421 --> 00:17:15,721
I would,

717
00:17:15,721 --> 00:17:16,830
I would talk to the kid and be like,

718
00:17:16,831 --> 00:17:17,041
Hey,

719
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:17,910
come live with me.

720
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,350
We'll have a TV show together.

721
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:22,920
I'll get you a podcast and
somehow turn the tables.

722
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:23,520
Well,

723
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,150
yeah,

724
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:26,400
I mean get a horse.

725
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,060
Yeah.

726
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,740
A couple of quotes thought
about being on the real house,

727
00:17:28,741 --> 00:17:29,850
husbands of Beverly Hills,

728
00:17:29,851 --> 00:17:33,180
but I'm thinking we can get a
reality show off the ground.

729
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:33,811
What do you,

730
00:17:33,811 --> 00:17:35,610
are you willing to marry a Kardashians?

731
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:36,390
Uh,

732
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,001
Oh my God,

733
00:17:37,001 --> 00:17:37,340
I've,

734
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:37,770
well,

735
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:38,520
hey,

736
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:42,810
I can't marry worse than I have because
they'd probably be a lot better.

737
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:43,620
Yeah.

738
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:43,961
Crazy.

739
00:17:43,961 --> 00:17:45,280
They're just an ambitious man.

740
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,590
Fuck man.

741
00:17:46,591 --> 00:17:48,120
So what's the solution?

742
00:17:48,121 --> 00:17:50,010
So you cannot to Canada and you

743
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:53,130
just send whatever you have and then
you have to constantly deal with legal

744
00:17:53,131 --> 00:17:55,110
payments because they're
constantly trying to fuck you.

745
00:17:55,111 --> 00:17:57,030
And she spent like year and a half

746
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,150
literally going to court every
single month with lawyers.

747
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,820
Just basically having to
go to court every month,

748
00:18:02,821 --> 00:18:03,240
just,

749
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,390
just stay out of jail to go and have
them put it over till the next month.

750
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:07,283
And the lawyers,

751
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,273
the lawyers,

752
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,270
you know,

753
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:11,730
I mean the people that do family law,

754
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:16,820
a lot of them are really horrible people
and they just make money off misery.

755
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,970
And even my own words,

756
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:21,810
we're just extending this as far as
they could until I ran out of money and

757
00:18:21,811 --> 00:18:22,140
like,

758
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:22,890
and then quit.

759
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,960
So when I went to court for this ruling,

760
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:25,530
I didn't have,

761
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,990
I didn't have a lawyer
that couldn't afford one.

762
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:28,950
So you went by yourself,

763
00:18:28,951 --> 00:18:29,910
was there by myself.

764
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,230
Not only was that there by myself,

765
00:18:31,231 --> 00:18:33,690
but all of the documents
that had been piled up,

766
00:18:33,691 --> 00:18:37,200
all of the evidence that had been piled
up over the course of a year and a half

767
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:38,820
was sitting in my lawyer's office.

768
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,200
Oh my God.

769
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:40,981
You know.

770
00:18:40,981 --> 00:18:42,750
So you had no evidence and no lawyer.

771
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,613
Yeah.

772
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,480
Did you have records?

773
00:18:45,481 --> 00:18:46,314
Did you have anything?

774
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:46,860
Nothing.

775
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,461
I had nothing.

776
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:47,841
God.

777
00:18:47,841 --> 00:18:49,020
So you're just going from there.

778
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:49,590
Nothing.

779
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,261
I have no money.

780
00:18:50,261 --> 00:18:50,370
I,

781
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,150
this is all I can do.

782
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:51,361
Yeah.

783
00:18:51,361 --> 00:18:55,260
And they're asking me questions about
files that have been piling up over a year

784
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,000
and a half.

785
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,833
You know,

786
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,471
I don't know.

787
00:18:58,471 --> 00:18:59,340
I don't recall.

788
00:18:59,341 --> 00:18:59,641
I don't,

789
00:18:59,641 --> 00:18:59,881
you know,

790
00:18:59,881 --> 00:19:00,420
cause I don't,

791
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,253
you know,

792
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,020
how do they justify such an
exorbitant amount of money?

793
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:04,950
Uh,

794
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:05,940
because it's the,

795
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,020
the,

796
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,870
as it was explained to me by
my lawyers was that the courts,

797
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:10,530
uh,

798
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:14,880
assumption is that the children should
continue to live at the level they were

799
00:19:14,881 --> 00:19:15,420
at,

800
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,820
at the time of the
dissolution of the marriage.

801
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:18,900
So,

802
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,200
which is crazy because if I were
still married and my income dropped,

803
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,490
their lifestyle would change.

804
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:23,970
Right.

805
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,650
But because we're not married anymore,

806
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,990
their lifestyle should never
change no matter what I'm earning.

807
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:28,501
What's that?

808
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:28,921
The judge,

809
00:19:28,921 --> 00:19:32,560
the ruling that was enforced was by
another judge named judge justice back

810
00:19:32,561 --> 00:19:33,394
backhouse.

811
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,880
And she's the one who ruled about three,

812
00:19:35,881 --> 00:19:38,730
four years ago when I went back
to try and get it adjusted,

813
00:19:38,731 --> 00:19:39,181
I went to,

814
00:19:39,181 --> 00:19:40,014
um,

815
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:40,771
to,

816
00:19:40,771 --> 00:19:40,920
uh,

817
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,700
have to have a hearing to have
it adjusted to meet my income.

818
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,170
Um,

819
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:50,730
and she ruled against me and in her
ruling she said my ability to pay was not

820
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,140
relevant to my obligation.

821
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:57,660
So it didn't matter to her what I proved
my income to be if my income was zero,

822
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:01,830
she said I was still obligated to pay
as though I was earning $1 million.

823
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:02,990
I know a lot of people were saying,

824
00:20:02,991 --> 00:20:03,741
Joe Rogan this day,

825
00:20:03,741 --> 00:20:05,330
fully guys bombing me the fuck out.

826
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,513
Like,

827
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:07,401
well listen,

828
00:20:07,401 --> 00:20:08,540
this is some important shit.

829
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,550
This was my education in,

830
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:14,700
in relationships and the law regarding
relationships as I was growing up.

831
00:20:14,701 --> 00:20:15,500
But literally,

832
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:15,831
I mean,

833
00:20:15,831 --> 00:20:18,890
when I was on news radio was a fresh
face boy didn't know Jack Shit about the

834
00:20:18,891 --> 00:20:19,430
world.

835
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:23,880
And this is how I learned
about relationships and
just how I learned about all

836
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:27,290
the whole gamut from divorce
to fucking murder suicide.

837
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,190
And I learned it all.

838
00:20:28,191 --> 00:20:29,240
You are happily married.

839
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:29,570
Yeah.

840
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:30,021
Crazy.

841
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:31,490
What are you guys figured it out?

842
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,413
Who Know?

843
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:33,843
Got Lucky.

844
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:34,900
Could go ugly for me too.

845
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,470
Wish I could do on your podcast.

846
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:42,210
I would probably seriously just move
somewhere like live on a beach in Jimmy

847
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,130
loves his kids.

848
00:20:43,131 --> 00:20:44,300
You get to see your kids.

849
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:44,931
Not now.

850
00:20:44,931 --> 00:20:46,650
I can't go to Canada so they can't see.

851
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,190
So you don't see him at all?

852
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:48,510
No.

853
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,600
It was the last time you saw them?

854
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:50,780
Uh,

855
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:51,880
was in uh,

856
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:53,410
uh,

857
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:54,220
November.

858
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:54,970
Wow.

859
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:55,860
That would drive me nuts.

860
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:56,650
That's my size.

861
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:57,410
Went to see my,

862
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:59,260
my son's play at school.

863
00:20:59,261 --> 00:21:00,094
It was last time I saw him.

864
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:02,710
And was the check there,

865
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:03,290
the wife?

866
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:03,541
No,

867
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:03,700
no,

868
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,181
she wasn't there.

869
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:04,960
Thank God.

870
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,640
So you have no communication
with her at all?

871
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:06,941
No,

872
00:21:06,941 --> 00:21:07,210
no,

873
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:07,451
no,

874
00:21:07,451 --> 00:21:07,660
not,

875
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,130
you don't have to pay any more alimony.

876
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:09,761
No,

877
00:21:09,761 --> 00:21:10,840
she didn't seek alimony.

878
00:21:10,841 --> 00:21:14,020
She sought a child support cause yeah.

879
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:16,810
But none of it got to the kids,

880
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:17,920
you know,

881
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,753
it all goes to her.

882
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,300
Yeah.

883
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,000
She was getting,

884
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,833
you know,

885
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:21,830
all this money.

886
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:23,800
And then on top of the
child support payment,

887
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:24,400
which is,

888
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,470
she was also getting something
called section seven expenses.

889
00:21:26,471 --> 00:21:28,840
But just basically anything she chose to,

890
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,610
to any bills she chose to run up,

891
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:31,720
what,

892
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,051
you know,

893
00:21:32,051 --> 00:21:34,450
so it'd be like $20,000 for summer camp,

894
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:35,621
things like that.

895
00:21:35,621 --> 00:21:37,690
Anything that was for
the kids that she chose.

896
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,170
Yeah.

897
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,610
So not just alimony,

898
00:21:39,611 --> 00:21:40,960
not we're not just child support,

899
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:43,750
but child support plus and then
all of her living expenses,

900
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:44,350
you know,

901
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,040
like the Mar,

902
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:45,551
the mortgage,

903
00:21:45,551 --> 00:21:46,410
and you know,

904
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:46,901
everything,

905
00:21:46,901 --> 00:21:47,621
medical expenses,

906
00:21:47,621 --> 00:21:48,390
everything.

907
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,780
It just makes me so it's,

908
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,653
it should make you sick.

909
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:22,800
Ah.
