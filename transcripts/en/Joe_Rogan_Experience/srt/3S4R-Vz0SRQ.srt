1
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:04,283
Okay.

2
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,393
Yeah,

3
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,410
we just got done with
another crazy podcast.

4
00:00:15,411 --> 00:00:16,410
I think I broke my brain

5
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:19,890
screw loose there somewhere.

6
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:21,990
I what if myself to death with Kangaroos.

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,120
That was the biggest ever.

8
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,540
Well I don't think so man.

9
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:31,630
I think it was 300 episodes.

10
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,840
I think that's up there
with the biggest ones,

11
00:00:33,841 --> 00:00:34,351
but I wouldn't,

12
00:00:34,351 --> 00:00:37,740
I wouldn't definitively pretty amazing
that you guys put out so many of these.

13
00:00:37,741 --> 00:00:40,560
I mean two or three hours of
intense discourse and extent.

14
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:40,800
I mean,

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,370
I'm pretty wiped out
and I haven't been here.

16
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:48,271
Alpha Bray,

17
00:00:48,271 --> 00:00:49,410
caffeine and marijuana,

18
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,410
your honor.

19
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,410
It's a violence.

20
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:55,950
Uh,

21
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:56,783
I'll be interested.

22
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:57,960
I'll lego you.

23
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:58,943
Uh,

24
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:03,070
do you guys have to barter,

25
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,460
right vitamins for the sh t shirts.

26
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:07,350
We got you those for sure.

27
00:01:07,351 --> 00:01:07,801
I was sitting,

28
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:09,840
I want you to get the Andrews
to ship to the guys and stuck.

29
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:10,693
So

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,930
answer me this question because nobody
makes a good thing for the movie.

31
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:21,870
I forgot to ask Jeff
Gaffigan to do this video.

32
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,253
He had to check.

33
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,510
You came up yesterday in Gaffney podcast,

34
00:01:27,511 --> 00:01:28,344
you know,

35
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,200
really good one.

36
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,280
I actually went and looked
online yesterday and it's
really true that they just

37
00:01:32,281 --> 00:01:33,450
need to make it a sexy,

38
00:01:33,451 --> 00:01:33,630
big,

39
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:33,930
big,

40
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:38,930
big foot like a female bigfoot in the
Hendersons been they can do better.

41
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:39,721
That's crazy.

42
00:01:39,721 --> 00:01:40,530
I haven't seen it.

43
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,041
I hadn't seen it,

44
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:41,551
but I can see,

45
00:01:41,551 --> 00:01:41,811
I see,

46
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:45,100
I see as three d trailer for
and from you from UDS film.

47
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,390
They showed it during the Singulair.

48
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:47,641
Okay.

49
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:51,240
So you got to go to singularity university
and probably get him to like invite

50
00:01:51,241 --> 00:01:54,630
you to one of their events and
we have to pay the $12,000 12,000

51
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,380
will I am was there
actually put your words,

52
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,940
they're like Sanderson culture.

53
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,390
They're getting more and more attention
to get these ideas about optimism as

54
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:09,770
well.

55
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:10,320
Like you,

56
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:10,740
you know,

57
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,530
can get the word out to 600,000 mines.

58
00:02:12,531 --> 00:02:13,070
Like I'm sure that there,

59
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:13,903
I don't really have a problem

60
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,060
coach Cremins plan to
assume a thing to say there.

61
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,370
How many Twitter followers
with national picture?

62
00:02:20,371 --> 00:02:21,204
I have too many.

63
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,133
Yeah,

64
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:23,443
he'd breaks Twitter

65
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:25,530
gets it.

66
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,363
He gets shows.

67
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,000
Media Entrepreneur.

68
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,840
Is that cause it's like,

69
00:02:29,841 --> 00:02:30,080
it's,

70
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,341
no,

71
00:02:30,341 --> 00:02:30,651
it's not.

72
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:31,101
As you know,

73
00:02:31,101 --> 00:02:31,791
it's profound.

74
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:32,421
It's ridiculous.

75
00:02:32,421 --> 00:02:32,661
I mean,

76
00:02:32,661 --> 00:02:33,620
it's amazing,

77
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:34,330
you know?

78
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,163
Hmm.

79
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,510
We'll stick with this question.

80
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,630
He gave up on his Twitter brother did it.

81
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,590
He kept on saying he kept on saying like
bad stuff on it and getting himself in

82
00:02:46,591 --> 00:02:48,620
trouble like that.

83
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,580
It's a responsibility,

84
00:02:50,581 --> 00:02:50,791
right?

85
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:53,970
The microphone means you want the map
before you better make sure you're saying

86
00:02:53,971 --> 00:02:55,510
something.

87
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,023
Responsibilities.

88
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:02,210
Well,

89
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:03,450
my drunk or high tweets

90
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,373
where

91
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,320
I was telling you about was so impressed
with your international following,

92
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,230
like people from the UK and people from
like all these different people do like

93
00:03:12,231 --> 00:03:13,220
the guy from Google,

94
00:03:13,221 --> 00:03:15,320
like all different walks of life.

95
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,350
A lot of it is because of the,

96
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:17,323
you know,

97
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,373
it's free.

98
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,241
Ease of access.

99
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:21,040
When we make it as easy as possible,

100
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,580
we put it up in as many forms as possible,

101
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,860
but instead of you go into Atlanta,

102
00:03:24,861 --> 00:03:25,071
right?

103
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:28,760
To give a show like every day you've
transcended geography with this show

104
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,260
because people from all across the board,

105
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,320
people isn't the buckeyes daily.

106
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:33,630
Then any auditory,

107
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,030
right?

108
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,100
Like what's the best way to get
across these ideas when you,

109
00:03:37,101 --> 00:03:39,680
you bring such a diverse range
of opinions at the table too,

110
00:03:39,681 --> 00:03:41,740
so it's so good for like the fan base.

111
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,380
The pharmacy do.

112
00:03:45,381 --> 00:03:47,500
This is where the cracks most

113
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:54,050
writing for big thing.com now it's
just like this new age type of news.

114
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,930
Do they have a sick backdrop
like first for their interview?

115
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,260
Right.

116
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:00,710
Awesome.

117
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,543
It's awesome.

118
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,193
We're building the,

119
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,660
we're starting to happen here
so I'd have them right here.

120
00:04:06,661 --> 00:04:07,494
These gentlemen.

121
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,360
I'll tell anybody here about your name.

122
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:10,403
Brian Epstein.

123
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,810
I pry hops and get out.

124
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,500
Get out of bitches.

125
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,340
Some of them were kicks.

126
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:17,260
Hi.

127
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:17,980
Hey everybody.

128
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:18,980
We live right now.

129
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,023
That's crazy.

130
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,720
Warrior poet.

131
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,080
You asked on Twitter,

132
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,700
also known as Aubrey.

133
00:04:25,701 --> 00:04:26,151
Marcus.

134
00:04:26,151 --> 00:04:27,710
The artist formally known as Chris.

135
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,360
We helped me almost changed your name.

136
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:29,981
Yeah.

137
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:31,220
You don't change your name again.

138
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,580
Boy Was it optimist.

139
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:34,423
Masters.

140
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,210
That was not so close.

141
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,810
No real before I like,

142
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,260
I like optimist.

143
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,890
I think we're going to incorporate that.

144
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,920
We should make it Twitter
and I got into the door.

145
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:44,740
Somebody else does.

146
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,410
We're fine now.

147
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,050
Somebody else is going to
try and sell that to me.

148
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:48,743
Fuck yeah,

149
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,561
there's benefit.

150
00:04:49,561 --> 00:04:51,190
And then there's a problem with,

151
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:51,700
uh,

152
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,490
which was doing everything live.

153
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,080
I think it ups the ante though.

154
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:55,771
A lot of these guys,

155
00:04:55,771 --> 00:04:56,760
they edit their shit,

156
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,091
you know,

157
00:04:57,091 --> 00:04:58,250
they edit their podcast,

158
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:58,550
the hand,

159
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:01,620
like musical cues and all that stuff and
they make it all professional and the

160
00:05:01,621 --> 00:05:03,090
insert commercials in it.

161
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,470
But you lose something,

162
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:07,590
you lose the live element is
part of what makes it fun.

163
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:08,130
You know?

164
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:08,950
I agree.

165
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:09,270
Yeah,

166
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:09,930
I agree.

167
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,390
Even when you're listening to afterwards,

168
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,930
you know that it was broadcast live.

169
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:13,981
This is the,

170
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:15,480
there's a certain energy to that.

171
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,314
Right.

172
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,590
Because this one was cool.

173
00:05:17,591 --> 00:05:21,010
I've lost track of time and the only
thing that was keeping pace with time as I

174
00:05:21,011 --> 00:05:22,690
was getting thirsty or
than I should have been

175
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,210
top your Ios Iowasca story.

176
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:25,540
I'm like,

177
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,373
there's no way.

178
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,300
I watched,

179
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:27,971
I watched a story.

180
00:05:27,971 --> 00:05:28,840
It was legendary,

181
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,770
but you talked it,

182
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:30,131
you're,

183
00:05:30,131 --> 00:05:30,511
I became,

184
00:05:30,511 --> 00:05:32,020
the story is better than you.

185
00:05:32,021 --> 00:05:35,380
I want some story that's a
crazy goddamn story and made me,

186
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,393
I don't want to do it.

187
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:37,900
I don't want to do that at all.

188
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,690
I was so down and do Iowasca I'm ready,

189
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:41,950
sign me up.

190
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,430
But I became like was just a
feeling like shit afterwards.

191
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:46,893
Not into it.

192
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,030
I'll get all my growth
through other sources.

193
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:49,893
Thanks.

194
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:51,520
It's a major,

195
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:52,960
it's a major tool.

196
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,630
I mean this is know you're so your close,

197
00:05:55,631 --> 00:05:56,860
you need a little tack Hammer.

198
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,190
This is the fucking wrecking

199
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:58,670
ball.

200
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:59,100
Boom.

201
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,080
I think if I got hooked up heroin I'd be
so down for it since I'm not on heroin.

202
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,920
I look at and go fuck it.

203
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:05,943
Sorry.

204
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:10,610
Ed Muskie was the guy that went crazy
because hunter s Thompson accused him of

205
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:11,730
being on a Ibogaine

206
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,000
hunter did a lot of stuff,

207
00:06:15,001 --> 00:06:17,600
but he must not have done a lot
of aggregate cause just can't,

208
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:18,983
is it possible?

209
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:19,920
We did on acid,

210
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:20,610
which was interesting.

211
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:22,340
He had a very weird reaction on acid.

212
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,550
He would like throw a fucking shoes
through windows and stuff and screaming.

213
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,760
People want to get his guns.

214
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:28,643
That's not good.

215
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,491
We had a very,

216
00:06:29,491 --> 00:06:30,140
uh,

217
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,170
cause the way his mind works,

218
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,640
it worked was very strange.

219
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,391
You know,

220
00:06:33,391 --> 00:06:37,170
it's interesting because that kind of was
like there in the 60s he was there and

221
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:40,230
the hippie generation of
the San Francisco Movement,

222
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:40,921
you know,

223
00:06:40,921 --> 00:06:41,201
the,

224
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:41,450
the,

225
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,600
the summer of love and all that,

226
00:06:42,601 --> 00:06:45,390
he was there to watch
like literally like that,

227
00:06:45,391 --> 00:06:45,960
like what,

228
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,410
what everybody at the time thought
was the changing of an age,

229
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:49,891
you know,

230
00:06:49,891 --> 00:06:54,210
and he's got this brilliant thing in
that documentary where he sort of watched

231
00:06:54,211 --> 00:06:57,600
that happen and then
watch the tide roll back,

232
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,231
you know,

233
00:06:58,231 --> 00:07:01,650
and then watch like the Nixon
administration afterwards
and watch Vietnam after

234
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,570
I lost it all fall away.

235
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,130
And it's really fascinating stuff,

236
00:07:05,131 --> 00:07:05,964
man.

237
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,350
He went through some shit,

238
00:07:07,351 --> 00:07:07,591
man,

239
00:07:07,591 --> 00:07:09,450
that generation went
through some crazy shit.

240
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,220
He went and it was amazing.

241
00:07:11,221 --> 00:07:12,870
The Hudson was legal magazines.

242
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,300
So many of them are still constantly,

243
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,140
yeah,

244
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:15,710
credible.

245
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,360
Well they're all wears off.

246
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:17,870
You know,

247
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,230
it's true.

248
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,550
A lot of it works and
everything does that.

249
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:23,300
So that's the biggest challenge was all
of this work is taking it and applying

250
00:07:23,301 --> 00:07:24,134
it to your life.

251
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,161
After you're done,

252
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:27,650
it's very easy to get slippery
and just kind of forget.

253
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,180
But it's always a move.

254
00:07:29,181 --> 00:07:30,320
So baseline a little bit,

255
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:30,711
you know.

256
00:07:30,711 --> 00:07:34,880
So where are you retreat to is never
quite the same as the way you work.

257
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,313
Um,

258
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,323
the quote,

259
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:37,910
uh,

260
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:40,100
inspiration works

261
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,840
but it's like bathing.

262
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:42,860
Uh,

263
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,970
it only lasts for so long.

264
00:07:43,971 --> 00:07:45,060
So we recommended daily.

265
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:45,940
Yeah.

266
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,640
You know,

267
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,040
it's really,

268
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,620
it's really,

269
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,453
I don't know who,

270
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,370
whose quote that is,

271
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:50,541
but that's a,

272
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:51,590
that's so make sense.

273
00:07:51,591 --> 00:07:51,771
Like,

274
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:52,130
yeah,

275
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,870
inspiration doesn't work always.

276
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,220
It's because you need it all at time.

277
00:07:55,221 --> 00:07:57,410
You need to like it to
be on that correct path.

278
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:01,700
All the checks the shamans recommend
once every two months doing something to

279
00:08:01,701 --> 00:08:02,534
read

280
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,210
a sweat lodge too.

281
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:06,520
Crazy sweat lodge.

282
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:08,540
You're ready.

283
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,110
I'm ready.

284
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,710
I'm ready.

285
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:10,041
No,

286
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:10,874
I would gain though.

287
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,460
Not Interested.

288
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,450
No,

289
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:16,621
no.

290
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,350
We're going to do a little quick videos
and right now I'm here with Matt Packs.

291
00:08:19,351 --> 00:08:22,130
Then I'm at water cleaner at [inaudible].

292
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,590
At Twitter you got to go to
the Adam Carolla podcast.

293
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,460
So like cheating on me.

294
00:08:26,461 --> 00:08:30,150
Man made friends.

295
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,560
I did get to Primo spot.

296
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,660
You got to be a lot of
the stories you tell them.

297
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:33,930
I don't know.

298
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,680
They'd be the same story stories,

299
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,710
motherfuckers kind of gang his stories.

300
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:39,180

301
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,260

were really inspirational.

304
00:08:43,201 --> 00:08:44,070
Really good stuff.

305
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,300
Great stuff about the
inmates and who was a,

306
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:52,310
that was a really up so we want to inform
you on every APP and every episode.

307
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,380
Yeah.

308
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,071
Good job dude.

309
00:08:56,071 --> 00:08:57,370
You took us on a trip today.

310
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,580
I'm going to have to start
watching that show every week now.

311
00:08:59,600 --> 00:08:59,880
I don't,

312
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,720
I'm scared of it though.

313
00:09:00,721 --> 00:09:05,400
There's a part of me that's I caught too
much shit like on my office is like not

314
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:07,680
hoarders but it's like it's good stuff.

315
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:08,191
I don't have like a,

316
00:09:08,191 --> 00:09:10,890

317
00:09:10,891 --> 00:09:11,724
anything.

318
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,520
You'd TV to watch it and you're not aware.

319

You sure you can find the TV to
turn on like though doesn't it?

320
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,330
That's what my house looks so

321
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,020
I need to clean your lane.

322

hollow.

Oh,

339
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,113
I said it.

340
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:58,350
C Two O is so blessed.

341
00:09:58,830 --> 00:09:59,940
Those guys can't do our show.

342
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,200
Yeah,

343
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:03,640
yeah.

344
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,473
They gave you so,

345
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:04,831
oh no,

346
00:10:04,831 --> 00:10:05,670
they gave me a book.

347
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,713
Coconut water

348
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,240
rotate.

349
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,530
Perpetrate page Turner.

350
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:11,190
Yeah.

351
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:11,730
What'd you do?

352
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:11,851
Oh,

353
00:10:11,851 --> 00:10:14,430
you have to do that thing where you
push your finger through it and cut your

354
00:10:14,431 --> 00:10:14,741
finger.

355
00:10:14,741 --> 00:10:15,574
Prick and a half.

356
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,250
We've got to shake it
and open up a little bit.

357
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,533
Oh,

358
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,350
shake it.

359
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:22,590
It's not carbonated and handed me
a shake and shake a carbonated.

360
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:23,820
When you say carbonate and stuff,

361
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:24,541
oh,

362
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,210
you don't have to shake it.

363
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,043
Nothing else.

364
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:27,380
All right,

365
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,213
great.

366
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,150
That through with me.

367
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:34,321
The first end of the day,

368
00:10:34,321 --> 00:10:34,980
that's what it was.

369
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,180
What was in the car and then here,

370
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:39,750
so then it was like a combo for a long
ass stretch with no weed whatsoever.

371
00:10:39,751 --> 00:10:40,200
Right.

372
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,033
How long did you go?

373
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:41,993
13 days.

374
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,900
How long has most of
the launch you've ever,

375
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,430
I've done and I just went five or six.

376
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:48,271
But this is,

377
00:10:48,271 --> 00:10:48,690
I became,

378
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,880
I became a heavy everyday smoker,

379
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,560
so to do that was really,

380
00:10:52,561 --> 00:10:55,220
withdrawal symptoms were weird with
the drifts onto the dreams were way,

381
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,123
way bigger.

382
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,950
But withdrawal symptoms
physically like you needed zero,

383
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,030
zero of those.

384
00:11:00,031 --> 00:11:01,890
No withdrawals don't get to it in a day.

385
00:11:01,891 --> 00:11:03,600
Like if I'm like busy and
I'm running around and no,

386
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:04,470
because I don't see any,

387
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:06,810
I don't just have a chance to like do
something cause I'm not going to work like

388
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,710
quite to something important.

389
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:08,820
You know,

390
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,480
this doesn't count.

391
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,790
The only thing I've ever
felt physically was,

392
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:12,540
uh,

393
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,950
I felt caffeine.

394
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:14,813
I felt coffee.

395
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,270
Oh that definitely helped that.

396
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:19,110
But like when I would take a
day off and they get a headache,

397
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:19,600
that's the only,

398
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,430
never felt physical.

399
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:20,910
Yeah.

400
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,300
But with,

401
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:21,990
with pot,

402
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:22,760
it was always I,

403
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,310
that was,

404
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,560
I was tapped to be top 1% users.

405
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:26,723
Users,

406
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:27,961
there was nothing.

407
00:11:27,961 --> 00:11:28,321
It was just like,

408
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:28,930
oh I didn't,

409
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:29,491
that didn't get to it.

410
00:11:29,491 --> 00:11:30,324
You shut it off.

411
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,810
Do you believe people when they say that
they have physical withdrawal symptoms

412
00:11:33,811 --> 00:11:35,260
or you think that trip man,

413
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,870
I had aspartame withdrawal symptoms,

414
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:37,943
aspartame

415
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:42,810
to pull over and stop cause I
couldn't see any more debilitating.

416
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,610
I didn't know that aspartame was,

417
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,630
it was addictive.

418
00:11:45,631 --> 00:11:46,464
You ever heard of that?

419
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,650
I don't know if it's addictive
but when I got off it,

420
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,670
it was in my system.

421
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,470
Oh but that's but isn't that also coke?

422
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,690
You would switch from coke.

423
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,240
I switched me coke to um,

424
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:57,770
to,

425
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:01,150
to sprite once and I was drinking tons
of it cause it was get free of the comedy

426
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,320
store when I worked there.

427
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:05,920
And so because I dropped the caffeine
then I got to keep driving migraines too.

428
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,000
But that wasn't her aspartame.

429
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,930
And I started doing a bunch of aspartame
when you got the headaches because I

430
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:14,230
was dating this girl and she looked it
up because I was having these migraines

431
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,270
and she said you'd be drinking
a bunch of crystal light.

432
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,490
Cause I was at the time just
shaking it up and making things,

433
00:12:18,491 --> 00:12:18,730
you know,

434
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:19,563
you can

435
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,090
cut it out.

436
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:23,060
Migraines went away.

437
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,550
Didn't know what it was.

438
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,480
That's what she said.

439
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:25,780
It might've,

440
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,070
I mean that might be psychosomatic,

441
00:12:27,071 --> 00:12:29,860
but there's all this stuff online
so aspartame causes these things,

442
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,630
but sometimes not in everybody.

443
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:31,961
It didn't.

444
00:12:31,961 --> 00:12:32,920
Donald Rumsfeld,

445
00:12:32,921 --> 00:12:34,840
wasn't he the guy who
pushed aspartame through?

446
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,810
I can say that where it's
like not fully tested.

447
00:12:37,811 --> 00:12:38,440
That's the negatives.

448
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,090
But then you'll get thinner.

449
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,160
Well when you think about it,

450
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:41,680
it matters.

451
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,090
Many people drink diet cokes.

452
00:12:43,091 --> 00:12:46,090
It's pretty God damn safe cause
everybody should be dropping like flies.

453
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,770
I mean it's not good for you,

454
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:48,670
but Jesus Christ,

455
00:12:48,671 --> 00:12:50,200
a lot of people drinking diet coke.

456
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,550
Where's all the brain tumors?

457
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:51,941
You know?

458
00:12:51,941 --> 00:12:53,820
I mean people like really exaggerated.

459
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,260
Certainly not good for
your odds of you Kevin.

460
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,190
Sure.

461
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:58,660
Yeah.

462
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,760
If you live a clean life
and eat healthy food,

463
00:13:00,761 --> 00:13:01,780
you're definitely better off.

464
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,830
But you know how many people are
getting cancer from diet coke?

465
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,310
No,

466
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:07,143
come on,

467
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,193
right,

468
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:08,651
Jesus.

469
00:13:08,651 --> 00:13:08,921
Sorry.

470
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:09,310
Sure.

471
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:09,700
Okay.

472
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,020
Hey shroom fest.

473
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,410
July 21st the 23rd everybody,

474
00:13:14,411 --> 00:13:18,100
wherever you are across the world
started looking now for your connections.

475
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,990
I have to make sure I don't
have to work that week.

476
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:20,950
Saturday,

477
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:21,480
Sunday,

478
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:21,510
Monday.

479
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,301
I mean that is Sunday.

480
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:22,860
Monday.

481
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:22,991
Yeah,

482
00:13:22,991 --> 00:13:24,400
but it might be a UFC weekend.

483
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,960
I'm in need of a good,

484
00:13:25,961 --> 00:13:26,990
true experience though.

485
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,800
That's the time I think I
need to go to the desert.

486
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,770
If you can even wait.

487
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:31,120
Loss.

488
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,841
That's the time.

489
00:13:31,841 --> 00:13:33,370
Contact the spirit world.

490
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:33,940
Yeah.

491
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,630
I need a gay,

492
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,070
get a fucking house in the mountains,

493
00:13:36,071 --> 00:13:36,340
man.

494
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:40,900
I just for that just for just for
like occasional trips for relaxation.

495
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:43,090
That'd be cool if you saw
that Deborah House Dab,

496
00:13:43,091 --> 00:13:43,924
it'd be amazing.

497
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:47,020
That's just something like that would
be the greatest thing to have ever.

498
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:50,500
You know to have like a house where
you could go do this in the woods on

499
00:13:50,501 --> 00:13:51,140
occasion.

500
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,050
You know away for Rogan.

501
00:13:53,051 --> 00:13:54,310
Compound on Brian.

502
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,790
Everything off since Sunday.

503
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,653
Family to a hotel.

504
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,130
Pound Bro.

505
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,380
Starting food,

506
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:00,780
using a greenhouse.

507
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,623
Grow your own food.

508
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:03,243
Animals,

509
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,630
Blacksmith your own bullets.

510
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,290
Be prepared for the apocalypse son.

511
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,870
Have her own kettle bells.

512
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,160
All right.

513
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,000
That's it with this one.

514
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,920
You guys soon know everybody?

515
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:15,551
Yes,

516
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,570
we are here.

517
00:14:16,571 --> 00:14:18,660
Joe Rogan and Brody Stevens.

518
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,623
Yes,

519
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,190
very positive today.

520
00:14:21,191 --> 00:14:22,600
Brody's feeling good.

521
00:14:22,601 --> 00:14:24,510
He's ready to begin his exercise.

522
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:24,810
Sure.

523
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,120
I am eating better.

524
00:14:26,121 --> 00:14:27,200
Cutting out soda

525
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,240
and girls.

526
00:14:29,241 --> 00:14:30,410
He's ready for Pussy.

527
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:30,901
Yes,

528
00:14:30,901 --> 00:14:31,380
I am.

529
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,400
Back in the game.

530
00:14:32,401 --> 00:14:33,011
You've got it.

531
00:14:33,011 --> 00:14:36,990
It's been a year and I'm going to
be back in doing what I can do.

532
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,060
Yes.

533
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,140
One whole game,

534
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,101
like one hill year,

535
00:14:40,101 --> 00:14:41,060
brother out of the game.

536
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:41,480
Um,

537
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,010
do you feel any ring rust?

538
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,060
Yes.

539
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,140
Any pressure to perform?

540
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,150
No.

541
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,280
Do you have any teams you're
scouting out right now?

542
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:51,210
Do you like team blonde?

543
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:52,170
I like to be below

544
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,750
y t blonde.

545
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,500
A team and team in the U hot,

546
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,453
passionate.

547
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,453
Gotta be cute.

548
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,171
Real hair.

549
00:15:00,171 --> 00:15:03,380
Or you give a fuck real hair or you
so you pushed me on the black girl.

550
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,460
Black girl with a wig.

551
00:15:04,461 --> 00:15:05,294
What'd he say?

552
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,980
I that doesn't float my boat,

553
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,360
but I'd be willing to try it.

554
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,450
No,

555
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:11,283
no,

556
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:11,481
no.

557
00:15:11,481 --> 00:15:13,730
I'm in there like a really white girls.

558
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,230
They're like a jury Nazi style.

559
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:15,581
Yeah.

560
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,200
Is that weird nose?

561
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,690
I have a Nazi fantasy.

562
00:15:18,691 --> 00:15:19,111
Yes.

563
00:15:19,111 --> 00:15:19,890
Gimme a chicken.

564
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,240
Glorious Bastard.

565
00:15:21,241 --> 00:15:21,961
All Scalp.

566
00:15:21,961 --> 00:15:22,590
You.

567
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,430
You got it.

568
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,570
That's what I want.

569
00:15:24,571 --> 00:15:26,880
How dare you keep me down.

570
00:15:26,881 --> 00:15:27,960
I'm a good guy.

571
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:31,320
Stop telling me to get laser hair removal.

572
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:32,550
I whoa.

573
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,680
Do it except me.

574
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,970
Yes.

575
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:37,853
No.

576
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:40,043
Yes.

577
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:40,420
I,

578
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:40,800
uh,

579
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,140
I think that was about as good
as we could have ever done it.

580
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:43,981
Thank you very much.

581
00:15:43,981 --> 00:15:44,310
Yeah.

582
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,210
Thanks for being on the show buddy.

583
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:45,661
Thank you.

584
00:15:45,661 --> 00:15:46,494
Did y'all see a pal?

585
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:48,140
Thanks all of a grip to tell.

586
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,320
He throws a mean fastball and if you
want to see Brody throw a fast ball in a

587
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,453
tennis court,

588
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,413
go see that on youtube.

589
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,470
It's on youtube.

590
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,393
How fast are you throwing?

591
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,880
That's probably now one.

592
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,430
Only in the mid eighties maybe,

593
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:00,960
but it's pretty fast.

594
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:01,800
It was at night.

595
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,950
It was on a tennis court.

596
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,100
Ultimate sound.

597
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,850
What's the fastest you've
ever thrown a baseball?

598
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,550
I got clocked at 91 college,

599
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:09,211
Arizona State.

600
00:16:09,211 --> 00:16:12,240
I can pitch with passion
and I was a good pitcher.

601
00:16:12,241 --> 00:16:12,940
I just like,

602
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,860
that's like pro speed,

603
00:16:13,861 --> 00:16:14,130
right,

604
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:14,580
isn't it?

605
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:14,841
Yeah,

606
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:15,420
it's close.

607
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,200
Yeah.

608
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,480
What's like a top of the line?

609
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:21,030
What's the fastest the guy can like what?

610
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:26,030
Like Roger Clemens in his prime was
probably fill him mid to upper nineties.

611
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:27,601
Yeah.

612
00:16:27,601 --> 00:16:27,811
Right.

613
00:16:27,811 --> 00:16:30,960
But mostly I would say mid nineties
for climate was got over a hundred.

614
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:31,940
Uh,

615
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,160
I mean,

616
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,530
Nolan Ryan back in the day you got John,

617
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,460
uh,

618
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,700
Verlander now going to tiger
stones over a hundred consistently.

619
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,410
Strasse right.

620
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,730
With the nationals,

621
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,430
hundred miles an hour starting pitchers.

622
00:16:44,431 --> 00:16:45,810
There's a lot of relievers you'd do it.

623
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,070
How hard is it to,

624
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:47,291
I mean,

625
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:48,124
that's like,

626
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,023
that's amazing.

627
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:49,741
I mean,

628
00:16:49,741 --> 00:16:50,251
you've got a year,

629
00:16:50,251 --> 00:16:50,910
they get hit it.

630
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:54,070
I mean Fuck Justin
Verlander I said Jonathan,

631
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,141
but I mean,

632
00:16:55,141 --> 00:16:55,800
how much,

633
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,940
how fast do you have to be?

634
00:16:56,941 --> 00:16:58,980
I mean like if Babe Ruth was alive today,

635
00:16:58,981 --> 00:17:00,210
would he be shitting his pants?

636
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,920
Would they be throwing
heat right past him?

637
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:02,221
You know,

638
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:03,420
a lot of people think that,

639
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:04,283
uh,

640
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:04,920
the guy,

641
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,870
I think more guys go harder now.

642
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:07,290
Yeah.

643
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:08,730
Then way back when,

644
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,040
way back then he probably
would have adjusted.

645
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,090
But,

646
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:12,720
um,

647
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,680
it's a timing thing.

648
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:14,070
Yeah.

649
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,900
But the guys do time at these hitters.

650
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:16,860
They figure it out.

651
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,330
They'll hit a hundred miles an hour.

652
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,820
What's the worst thing that ever happened
in baseball when they started testing

653
00:17:20,821 --> 00:17:21,654
for steroids?

654
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:22,591
You know,

655
00:17:22,591 --> 00:17:27,120
I'd like to see because when you're not
doing steroids or HGH and ends careers,

656
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,750
I mean who didn't like watching
Barry bonds had all those home runs,

657
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:32,900
had two who didn't like
watching Roger Clemens pitch it.

658
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,640
42 Nolan Ryan pitched show.

659
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,060
He's 46 he went on steroids.

660
00:17:36,061 --> 00:17:40,260
But it'd be great to see guys continue
to play like after 40 you can take a

661
00:17:40,261 --> 00:17:40,861
supplement,

662
00:17:40,861 --> 00:17:42,330
you can take out an MMA.

663
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,653
You're allowed to.

664
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,680
There's a lot of guys.

665
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,680
Dan Henderson's on
testosterone replacement.

666
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,320
Oh,

667
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,160
the rampage just admitted he
was testosterone replacement.

668
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:50,460
Yeah,

669
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,293
I was at the door.

670
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:53,000
What Norman today?

671
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:53,751
No,

672
00:17:53,751 --> 00:17:54,590
but for what

673
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,190
I,

674
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,130
this isn't the ice house.

675
00:17:57,131 --> 00:17:58,030
You got to get around the alley.

676
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,240
Well yeah,

677
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,380
it goes behind

678
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,033
the shoulder,

679
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,550
but wonderful interview.

680
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,393
I don't know what just happened.

681
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,920
Did that guy look like a natural?

682
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:10,361
No,

683
00:18:10,361 --> 00:18:10,561
no,

684
00:18:10,561 --> 00:18:13,150
I didn't look like Don Johnson's Dad.

685
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:14,850
Oh,

686
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:15,950
so he's got a nice spirit.

687
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,990
I think they should have let the guys,

688
00:18:17,991 --> 00:18:19,160
when you over 40,

689
00:18:19,161 --> 00:18:20,240
you're allowed to take,

690
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,620
if they sponsored it,

691
00:18:21,621 --> 00:18:23,390
they look at it some kind of,

692
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,370
and did they treat it like
these guys are stealing babies.

693
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:26,641
You know,

694
00:18:26,641 --> 00:18:27,091
they're making it,

695
00:18:27,091 --> 00:18:29,910
all they're doing is taking something
and it makes them perform better and

696
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:32,070
things that make your body perform better.

697
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:34,770
It shouldn't that just be researched more.

698
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,161
I mean,

699
00:18:35,161 --> 00:18:38,580
it seems to me that as long
as these people aren't dying
and not getting cancer,

700
00:18:38,581 --> 00:18:39,330
this isn't some,

701
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,740
some crazy stuff that goes on.

702
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:43,530
They're going to reputable doctors
and they're doing this release.

703
00:18:43,531 --> 00:18:44,281
Clemens was,

704
00:18:44,281 --> 00:18:45,114
and I don't know,

705
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,340
Barry bonds was involved
in that bulk of thing.

706
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:47,971
Oh yeah.

707
00:18:47,971 --> 00:18:48,804
Yeah.

708
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:49,121
You know,

709
00:18:49,121 --> 00:18:52,180
I guess they say because it makes
for an uneven playing field,

710
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,890
but as more research comes out,

711
00:18:53,891 --> 00:18:55,390
everybody hopefully would know like,

712
00:18:55,391 --> 00:18:55,751
you know what,

713
00:18:55,751 --> 00:18:56,350
HGH,

714
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,190
it's not bad for you.

715
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,210
It's actually good for you.

716
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,390
I want to take it at
like a vitamin almost.

717
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,110
Yeah.

718
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:01,440
Yeah.

719
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:01,780
Um,

720
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,400
I think there's a lot of
ignorance when it comes to it,

721
00:19:03,401 --> 00:19:04,600
but it's fascinating to me.

722
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:07,360
They would spend so much
time in front of Congress.

723
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:08,463
They were like,

724
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:08,740
you know,

725
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,450
they had this trial,

726
00:19:10,451 --> 00:19:12,110
the Barry bonds trial and yeah,

727
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,230
as far as um,

728
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:13,511
uh,

729
00:19:13,511 --> 00:19:14,350
Roger Clemens too,

730
00:19:14,351 --> 00:19:15,310
I think it goes down to,

731
00:19:15,311 --> 00:19:20,140
it becomes a perjury trial because they
caught them saying in the past under

732
00:19:20,141 --> 00:19:21,760
oath they weren't under some stuff.

733
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:22,000
Right.

734
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,833
Cause they can't,

735
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,150
it's not illegal to take
human growth hormone.

736
00:19:25,151 --> 00:19:26,800
It's not illegal to take testosterone,

737
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:30,280
but it's illegal as to lie when
they ask you are you taking things?

738
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:30,960
Yeah.

739
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,100
And they did that and
you had Maguire up there.

740
00:19:33,101 --> 00:19:33,940
You had a,

741
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:34,950
yeah.

742
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,530
When McGuire took that new job,

743
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:39,230
then he had to come out and
sort of explain everything.

744
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,010
Yeah.

745
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:40,880
He didn't get in trouble though.

746
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,753
It's batteries dying.

747
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:42,291
Well,

748
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:43,170
so as this conversation,

749
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:44,060
it's fucking boring anyway.

750
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,630
Joe's talk baseball that you
take whatever the fuck they want.

751
00:19:47,631 --> 00:19:48,120
That's what I say.

752
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:52,730
Don't you saying ready for the game and
makes it better showing good part of

753
00:19:52,731 --> 00:19:52,801
that,

754
00:19:52,801 --> 00:19:55,220
that fucking games when they hit
that ball only after 40 though.

755
00:19:55,221 --> 00:19:56,054
Not before.

756
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:00,420
Oh folks,

757
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,030
today black.

758
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,230
We'll back bitches.

759
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:03,430
Joey Diaz always.

760
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:03,730
And John,

761
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:04,870
what's happening in beautiful people.

762
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:05,860
Another fun podcast.

763
00:20:05,861 --> 00:20:06,401
My friend bed,

764
00:20:06,401 --> 00:20:09,370
this podcast number one
99 you've come a long way,

765
00:20:09,371 --> 00:20:10,180
baby.

766
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,380
It's been an interesting little ride.

767
00:20:11,381 --> 00:20:12,050
It's been a lot of fun,

768
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:12,550
hasn't it?

769
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,120
Fuck yeah.

770
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,830
A couple times a month you come up here,

771
00:20:14,831 --> 00:20:15,670
you talk shit.

772
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,440
People like it and it's free.

773
00:20:17,441 --> 00:20:19,180
You get fucking entertain at work,

774
00:20:19,181 --> 00:20:19,570
whatever.

775
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:21,730
I can honestly say it's transformed.

776
00:20:21,731 --> 00:20:24,820
My life transformed my life
as a comedian for sure.

777
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:26,620
Helped me a lot of fucking ways.

778
00:20:26,621 --> 00:20:29,990
You mother fuckers are bad motherfuckers
just for sticking around other support.

779
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:31,690
This we love you guys.

780
00:20:31,691 --> 00:20:33,150
You know I'll tell you stories,

781
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:34,160
whatever the fuck you want to hear,

782
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,500
the support we get from you guys.

783
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:37,020
It's not like anything I've ever done any,

784
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:40,240
any blown the time before
and it makes me work harder.

785
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:40,810
Yeah,

786
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:41,420
we work hard.

787
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,490
It'd be better for you guys.

788
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:45,220
So that is absolutely true from Hq.

789
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,001
Perform more.

790
00:20:46,001 --> 00:20:47,170
I'm doing a lot of sense,

791
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,220
especially

792
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,720
gearing up for the Atlanta thing.

793
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,180
I'm,

794
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,013
I'm,

795
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,920
we're all in like a real
perfect time right now.

796
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,550
I been working out too soon.

797
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,440
Don't beautiful lawn out loud.

798
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:58,863
Wait

799
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:01,683
two hours.

800
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,890
What are you doing today brother?

801
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:11,340
You have to go to the spot.

802
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,030
No,

803
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,370
I got a bogie state.

804
00:21:14,371 --> 00:21:16,090
Black motherfuckers have a great week.

805
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,021
D is in the house.

806
00:21:17,021 --> 00:21:17,620
Ladies and gentleman.

807
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,570
Csu on one 99 podcasts.

808
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:20,651
Number one,

809
00:21:20,651 --> 00:21:21,484
nine nine.

810
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:23,040
It's gone right now.

811
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:23,971
Dot.

812
00:21:23,971 --> 00:21:24,930
Merera how you doing buddy?

813
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,073
Oh,

814
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,200
you're in this right,

815
00:21:28,201 --> 00:21:29,034
Joe.

816
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:29,680
Hey,

817
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,520
stop meeting and you're
talking to the world.

818
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:34,140
We just did a podcast together.

819
00:21:34,141 --> 00:21:35,040
This is our video blog.

820
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:38,650
This is a nice relaxing
after being with God.

821
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:39,503
We were funny.

822
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:40,810
Boy.

823
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:44,160
You know I'm not well
when you're on your own,

824
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,460
that's about it.

825
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:46,543
You,

826
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:47,840
you have a gift to me.

827
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:52,290
A gift to you should you know that you
share with other people can you can mock

828
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:52,890
if you want Joe,

829
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:53,723
but I mean it.

830
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,310
Sarcasm is comedy.

831
00:21:56,311 --> 00:21:57,144
Ladies and gentlemen.

832
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,770
Do you write your own stuff?

833
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,090
Are you having an agile team?

834
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:00,980
Writers?

835
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,780
So I try to just find it written right.

836
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:03,330
Ready?

837
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:05,880
What does that Guy Brian
do all the guy works on me.

838
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:07,290
How's that camera is right there?

839
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,090
What is,

840
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,113
what's wrong with him?

841
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,440
What's wrong with him.

842
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,450
He creates this,

843
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,190
he creates what's wrong with them.

844
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,330
And that is a,

845
00:22:18,331 --> 00:22:19,740
it's a talent in and of itself.

846
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:20,071
It's a,

847
00:22:20,071 --> 00:22:22,680
it's a part of a performance art form.

848
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,500
He makes me feel good about myself cause
he's so much younger than me and yet

849
00:22:25,501 --> 00:22:28,410
he's more pear shaped the way his hip,

850
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,060
lazy like a woman,

851
00:22:30,061 --> 00:22:30,894
to be honest.

852
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,690
I curves dot.

853
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:34,651
Did you want to do,

854
00:22:34,651 --> 00:22:37,530
I gave voice will list who he did.

855
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,300
Yeah.

856
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,690
There certain things.

857
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:42,630
How do you do what you can't even
do with gay voice in 2012 anymore?

858
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,970
It's like if you're in your
act and you do a gay voice,

859
00:22:44,971 --> 00:22:45,330
it's like,

860
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,040
well it's kind of,

861
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,890
it's so hacky.

862
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,180
When you do a gay guy,

863
00:22:48,181 --> 00:22:48,900
you gotta,

864
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,830
you gotta do them aggressive.

865
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:57,790
I think gay ski bastard.

866
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,230
A Tahitian.

867
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:00,860
Alright.

868
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:03,570
A gate to Haitian flight
attendant and Nina,

869
00:23:03,571 --> 00:23:06,430
how gay guys can get away with
it more than straight guys.

870
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,481
Like I'm a strict guy.

871
00:23:07,481 --> 00:23:08,171
He said something to you,

872
00:23:08,171 --> 00:23:09,090
go fuck you.

873
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:09,520
Right.

874
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,240
But this guy says,

875
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,510
I forgot how much weight they've
gained and it goes like this.

876
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:12,770
Wow,

877
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:13,990
this might be good for the stage.

878
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:14,681
He goes,

879
00:23:14,681 --> 00:23:15,430
uh,

880
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:16,120
uh,

881
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,730
they said they're going to give you
pajamas cause the flight Solon was from

882
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:19,564
Paris to La.

883
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,171
He goes,

884
00:23:20,171 --> 00:23:20,440
uh,

885
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,850
what size pajamas do you wear?

886
00:23:21,851 --> 00:23:22,181
I can't.

887
00:23:22,181 --> 00:23:22,691
There was voice.

888
00:23:22,691 --> 00:23:23,210
And he'd go,

889
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:24,100
I don't know medium.

890
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,600
And he hands me an extra large.

891
00:23:25,601 --> 00:23:27,070
It goes Pele's.

892
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:30,270
I know,

893
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:30,450
but,

894
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,160
but I'm frustrating.

895
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,620
I did that and he went,

896
00:23:32,621 --> 00:23:33,430
what are you kidding?

897
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:34,540
You go fuck you man.

898
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:35,500
But it was a gay guy.

899
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:36,160
You know,

900
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:36,993
it's funny,

901
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:40,420
but gay guys are allowed to
like shit out of their cars.

902
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,700
They're also allows action.

903
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:42,370
Right?

904
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:45,380
Like a guy can't do that to a girl
if he's not in having with her,

905
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:49,190
I give a girl came over and tried to
hit on a guy and a guy won police.

906
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:49,650
Yeah,

907
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:50,490
that would be an ass.

908
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:52,490
But he can do it to a guy that's hitting,

909
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,510
but they can also grab
a woman's breast and go,

910
00:23:54,511 --> 00:23:55,880
these are so cute.

911
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,760
They get away with that
and nonthreatening.

912
00:23:59,210 --> 00:23:59,810
Yeah.

913
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,860
They can hug them and
pal around with him down.

914
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,660
Every now and then they'll get drunk
and do croc and they will fuck.

915
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:07,003
Really?

916
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:09,350
How do you know I don't
leave them alone again guys?

917
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,233
Somebody told you.

918
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:10,971
Oh Trust.

919
00:24:10,971 --> 00:24:12,500
The moment he stops talking to you.

920
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:15,890
Don't always buy it everybody.

921
00:24:15,891 --> 00:24:16,641
Bye everybody.

922
00:24:16,641 --> 00:24:17,870
Thank you don.

923
00:24:17,871 --> 00:24:18,380
My Railroad,

924
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:18,871
I r.

925
00:24:18,871 --> 00:24:19,320
R

926
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:19,921
powerful.

927
00:24:19,921 --> 00:24:20,850
Amy Schumer,

928
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,110
you on video right now.

929
00:24:22,111 --> 00:24:23,300
You're not even prepared me.

930
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:27,180
I need you guys to see
this post food poisoning.

931
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,840
Not Prepared and have her parents
all pumped up full of céline.

932
00:24:30,841 --> 00:24:32,390
And what B drugs would they look?

933
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,980
They look you up with
some good more fizzle.

934
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:35,910
They gave you morphine.

935
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:36,923
Wow.

936
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:37,710
What?

937
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,720
How they give it to you do the IB.

938
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,920
They don't tell you before
like what's going to happen.

939
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,990
So I all of a sudden I'm like,

940
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:43,980
I can't feel my neck.

941
00:24:43,981 --> 00:24:44,371
And they were like,

942
00:24:44,371 --> 00:24:47,820
that's the morphine and like can I get
a heads up if I'm going to stop feeling

943
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:51,680
body parts and went in through your arm
and it kills the feeling in your neck.

944
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:55,500
Well just like numbness
but yet my good though,

945
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,553
I heard it feels awesome.

946
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:57,683
Pretty good.

947
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:57,981
Brian,

948
00:24:57,981 --> 00:24:58,850
have you ever had morphine?

949
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:00,800
No.

950
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,300
You gotta have you gotta get more?

951
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:02,750
Yeah,

952
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:05,090
I know they gave it to me in
like a drip when I was young.

953
00:25:05,091 --> 00:25:06,650
I had my first knee surgery.

954
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:07,570
Um,

955
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:10,210
and they also put you on like a
perpetual motion machine that you know,

956
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,053
morphine drip.

957
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:11,970
Oo.

958
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:12,680
Yeah.

959
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,970
What's a perpetual motion?

960
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:14,431
You have one,

961
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:18,170
you have certain types of knee
surgery and certain doctors,

962
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,120
there's a bunch of different
schools of thought,

963
00:25:20,121 --> 00:25:22,850
but some doctors on certain
particular knee surgeries,

964
00:25:22,851 --> 00:25:26,060
like a ACL reconstructions
right after they do it,

965
00:25:26,061 --> 00:25:27,620
they want blood flow to the knee.

966
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,041
Yeah.

967
00:25:28,041 --> 00:25:29,740
They put you on a machine
that's moving your,

968
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:32,920
moving your leg in a very limited motion.

969
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,420
It's not going to go any further.

970
00:25:34,421 --> 00:25:35,380
A second extend anymore.

971
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:35,890
Yeah.

972
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:36,910
So it does this,

973
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:40,760
just to kind of keep your thing from
freezing up is that it becomes a real

974
00:25:40,761 --> 00:25:41,320
problem.

975
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:41,630
Um,

976
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:42,020
yeah.

977
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:42,980
So that's what I've got.

978
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:45,080
I don't remember it much.

979
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:45,923
I just of fuck.

980
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:46,670
Yeah.

981
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,880
Do you remember coding whenever,

982
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,070
when Nyquil had coding?

983
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,313
No,

984
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:51,951
I knew it dude.

985
00:25:51,951 --> 00:25:52,790
He used to drink a purple.

986
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:53,331
I knew a dude.

987
00:25:53,331 --> 00:25:54,470
He used to drink nyquil.

988
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:55,190
He was addicted.

989
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,810
He used to go out and he
would go to a comedy club,

990
00:25:56,811 --> 00:25:58,610
but he would have like a guidance comics.

991
00:25:58,611 --> 00:25:59,990
I've run out and buy him nightfall.

992
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:01,130
Wow.

993
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:05,380
That was like his lobbying
with Texas to really sad.

994
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,000
Yeah.

995
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,621
Cough Syrup.

996
00:26:06,621 --> 00:26:06,911
Right.

997
00:26:06,911 --> 00:26:08,230
So Cody Cody,

998
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:08,750
awesome.

999
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:11,620
Is that what they mean when
they say sipping on scissors or,

1000
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:12,370
oh,

1001
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:13,203
it's great.

1002
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:13,850
It's great.

1003
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:14,090
Who's,

1004
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:16,980
is there a wider human
sipping on the scissor?

1005
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:20,860
You said your countries,

1006
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:21,770
uh,

1007
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:22,400
stuff.

1008
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:22,641
Yeah,

1009
00:26:22,641 --> 00:26:24,170
that's Sunny D.

1010
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:25,071
Oh no,

1011
00:26:25,071 --> 00:26:25,904
it's different.

1012
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:30,290
So you were ignorant to the world of the
scissor until right now I did not know.

1013
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,480
I have lived such a sheltered life.

1014
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,320
Have you ever done that?

1015
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,720
Brian just got fucked up on cough
syrup and I know people that have,

1016
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:37,431
well,

1017
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:38,090
I tried that.

1018
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:42,650
I remember one time I was sick and I got
ahold of some of the last real nyquil.

1019
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:45,740
They have the coding and I was fucked up.

1020
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,430
I'm not so good.

1021
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,270
A second.

1022
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:51,050
I was watching TV and it was one of
those old TVs and was actually going to,

1023
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:53,703
you know,

1024
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,360
remember those,

1025
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,450
they were square for some reason and
the movies were all cut off and they had

1026
00:26:57,451 --> 00:27:02,190
like a rounded sort of surrounding
action is in the middle watching TV.

1027
00:27:02,191 --> 00:27:03,290
Just so happy.

1028
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,370
Wonderful feeling.

1029
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,650
I can see how people get addicted to that.

1030
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:09,083
Yeah.

1031
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,550
I remember thinking as I was like,

1032
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:11,911
wow,

1033
00:27:11,911 --> 00:27:16,911
this is really nice now that could
happen and then I understand that dude,

1034
00:27:17,461 --> 00:27:20,520
that dude that I had known about that
and how to the comic that had an issue.

1035
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:20,790
I'm like,

1036
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:21,060
oh,

1037
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:21,420
okay,

1038
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,080
now I get it.

1039
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:22,530
Yeah,

1040
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:23,520
he likes a great time.

1041
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,750
Up until I got a little while and used
to be able to just blank coding and it's

1042
00:27:27,751 --> 00:27:28,501
essentially you're going,

1043
00:27:28,501 --> 00:27:30,300
you're buying like a hardcore drunk,

1044
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,130
you drink a bottle.

1045
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:33,900
Damn,

1046
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,370
you're going to get fucked up.

1047
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:35,821
I mean,

1048
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,380
how many doses or in a bottle

1049
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,800
bottles every weekend.

1050
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:41,521
Yeah.

1051
00:27:41,521 --> 00:27:45,360
My mom like must have taught you well
because like she always uses a spoon for

1052
00:27:45,361 --> 00:27:48,600
any kind of cough syrup like
were like other people I've met.

1053
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,580
They just chuck out a bottle or you know,

1054
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:51,423
stuff like that.

1055
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:54,920
I have been trained you students
and I think that's why I never,

1056
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,960
well well your mother's doing what?

1057
00:27:57,961 --> 00:27:59,040
Normal fucking humans.

1058
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,980
I was like amazing.

1059
00:28:01,981 --> 00:28:03,360
She didn't just like pour it down.

1060
00:28:03,361 --> 00:28:08,280
My throat might say my mom used to
hold me up like one of those birds.

1061
00:28:08,281 --> 00:28:11,700
They get fogged why out of when they
force feed them and that's what she would

1062
00:28:11,701 --> 00:28:11,821
do.

1063
00:28:11,821 --> 00:28:14,700
She would shove a funnel in
my mouth for the medicine.

1064
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:22,210
Make Fun wa you know fog wise.

1065
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:24,480
Yeah.

1066
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,020
They serve a nextdoor to install Lucho

1067
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:28,831
it's crazy.

1068
00:28:28,831 --> 00:28:31,200
They take this fucking dog
and I opened his mouth,

1069
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:33,660
shut its mouth into this too.

1070
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,390
And then all this green
comes for the force,

1071
00:28:36,391 --> 00:28:38,180
feed them feet,

1072
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,750
fills him up with,

1073
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,690
with grain and then they pull them off
the thing and get them away and then they

1074
00:28:43,691 --> 00:28:45,960
take the next stuck and
stuff is open his mouth.

1075
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:48,940
Yes.

1076
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:53,480
And it's now becoming legal
in California until uh,

1077
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:56,040
we felt rather starting in June,

1078
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,113
starting in June,

1079
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:01,410
you could still get an in
Vegas [inaudible] Vegas.

1080
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:06,810
But the thing is it doesn't really,

1081
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:09,720
it only takes a few seconds and the ducks
day and it doesn't even bother them.

1082
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:12,670
It's not like a,

1083
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:14,820
it doesn't affect them like the
way it would affect a person,

1084
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:18,720
apparently their docs and then go
fuck themselves and not really sad.

1085
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,250
I don't think Jack's really like you.

1086
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,680
I don't think I've seen no evidence.

1087
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,330
They want your bread
when you're at the pond.

1088
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,290
Fucking ducks,

1089
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:32,970
ducks dirty bitch.

1090
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:33,840
I'm gonna eat your liver.

1091
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:35,161
Yeah,

1092
00:29:35,161 --> 00:29:35,521
we're no,

1093
00:29:35,521 --> 00:29:37,080
we're no better than Hannibal Lecter,

1094
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:38,123
right?

1095
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:41,070
So have you ever thought
about going Vegan?

1096
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:42,490
No.

1097
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:43,140
Good for you.

1098
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:43,973
I see that.

1099
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,593
Don't say that out.

1100
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,440
We're on the Internet.

1101
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:48,820
We're here with Neil Brennan.

1102
00:29:48,821 --> 00:29:49,654
Ladies and gentlemen.

1103
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:52,900
Video now some a sentence
and paperwork for Joe.

1104
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:53,351
Yeah,

1105
00:29:53,351 --> 00:29:56,260
we make them sign waivers because this
mother fucker talks a lot of shit and I

1106
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:59,470
don't want to be held
responsible for any as nonsense.

1107
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:01,703
You're fat

1108
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:04,481
a day.

1109
00:30:04,481 --> 00:30:05,650
He hits right where you live,

1110
00:30:05,651 --> 00:30:05,921
man.

1111
00:30:05,921 --> 00:30:06,754
He goes to the heart.

1112
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,241
Let's go.

1113
00:30:07,241 --> 00:30:08,870
Brennan has his own podcast.

1114
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:09,880
It's called Champs.

1115
00:30:09,881 --> 00:30:10,360
The champs.

1116
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,110
The champs.

1117
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:11,411
It's good.

1118
00:30:11,411 --> 00:30:12,640
We only have mostly blacks.

1119
00:30:12,641 --> 00:30:13,930
We've had a Blake Griffin.

1120
00:30:13,931 --> 00:30:14,770
We've had Queslo,

1121
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,410

1122
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,130

1123
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:18,930

1124
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:19,600

1125
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,530

1126
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:21,391
Sasha grey.

1127
00:30:21,391 --> 00:30:21,940
Flash of gray.

1128
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:22,773

00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,560
His name is flying Lotus.

1131
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:27,550
Another dude.

1132
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:28,060
He's fun.

1133
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:28,810
Awesome.

1134
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:29,440
Flying Lotus.

1135
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:29,690
Yeah.

1136
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:29,940
Yeah.

1137
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:30,340
But yeah,

1138
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:30,970
that's not,

1139
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:31,091

1140
00:30:31,091 --> 00:30:31,790
that's not her boyfriend.

1141
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:32,260
That's it.

1142
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,091
That is a black guy.

1143
00:30:33,091 --> 00:30:34,060
That was also on the show.

1144
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:34,420
Yeah.

1145
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:37,510
Flying Lotus made that one of
the most incredible videos ever.

1146
00:30:37,511 --> 00:30:37,790
Right?

1147
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,550
Isn't he the one that did that?

1148
00:30:39,551 --> 00:30:40,660
Tim and Eric Video.

1149
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:40,940
Yeah.

1150
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:43,240
You see the music behind
the Tim and Eric Video?

1151
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:43,870
Yeah.

1152
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:45,750
The one with the guy
who goes to the disco.

1153
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:46,571
No,

1154
00:30:46,571 --> 00:30:47,500
I don't think that he did that.

1155
00:30:47,501 --> 00:30:48,550
So I don't know.

1156
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,690
That might be major lazer.

1157
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:49,921
Yeah,

1158
00:30:49,921 --> 00:30:51,320
it's major Lazer boot.

1159
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:52,550
Is it major Lazer in?

1160
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:52,810
Yeah.

1161
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:53,140
Oh,

1162
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:53,860
okay.

1163
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:54,830
I am a fucking,

1164
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:58,060
I am a useful piece of disinformation.

1165
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,850
That's why I'm leading cable,

1166
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:00,460
right answer.

1167
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:00,880
Yes.

1168
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,280
Eventually your stupidity
leads us down the right path.

1169
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:07,900
I could fuck up your Google search so
you can be convinced them right off and

1170
00:31:07,901 --> 00:31:08,734
I'm wrong.

1171
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:08,981
Well,

1172
00:31:08,981 --> 00:31:09,580
that's it,

1173
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:09,941
folks.

1174
00:31:09,941 --> 00:31:11,110
We just wanted to say hi here.

1175
00:31:11,111 --> 00:31:14,890
It's Neil Brennan and make sure that
if you enjoy Neil on our podcast,

1176
00:31:14,891 --> 00:31:16,210
you subscribed to him.

1177
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,103
You'll like the champs,

1178
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,070
the champs,

1179
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:20,530
especially if you're really
into talking to black guys.

1180
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:21,403
Yeah.

1181
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:22,490
All right.

1182
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:23,323
Later,

1183
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,550
the Joe Rogan experience

1184
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:32,500
[inaudible]

1185
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:36,011
and half,

1186
00:31:36,011 --> 00:31:37,110
and the other one's like now.

1187
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:40,881
Oh,

1188
00:31:40,881 --> 00:31:41,691
so you DJ.

1189
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:42,524
Why you chose,

1190
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:46,683
okay,

1191
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,573
it's about to rain.

1192
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,010
Okay.
