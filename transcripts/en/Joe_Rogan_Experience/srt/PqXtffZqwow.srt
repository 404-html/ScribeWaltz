1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,020
Gosh. Dang. Is this working? Hi,

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,950
this is Bill Gates and you're
listening to the Joe Rogan podcast.

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,770
We were just talking before you can
hear and ladies and gentlemen about

4
00:00:10,771 --> 00:00:15,150
unsolicited testimonials
or soliciting testimonials,

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,130
right?
Yeah,

6
00:00:17,131 --> 00:00:20,880
but it's not really a testimonial because
you're just asking a celebrity to say,

7
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,740
ah, you're the audience is listening to
the Joe Rogan podcast. Like, you know,

8
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:29,990
hi, this is calling for him.
Is that your phone on my phone?

9
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,330
I don't use that stupid ring.

10
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,260
This is highly unprofessional.
Okay,

11
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,680
here we go. The Joe Rogan
experience podcast is brought
to you by the fleshlight.

12
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,350
If you go to Joe rogan.net, click on
the link for the flashlight in her,

13
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,180
in the code name, Rogan blahdy
blahdy Blah. Save some money.

14
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,860
You get a 15% off number
one sex toy for men. Um,

15
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,580
I actually used it the other day.
Remember I've tip too from you. Yes.

16
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,930
I attempt to, and I
used one like maybe, uh,

17
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,940
two weeks ago and I took two cause
I knew I didn't want to wash it.

18
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:18,840
So I used it and threw it away.
It was cool. It was it. That's it.

19
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,720
You just a one hit it and quit it.
That's it.

20
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,120
No need to save it. Well, you can
always get a new one for me, buddy,

21
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,510
anytime you want. Yeah, I
did. That'd be cool. You know,

22
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,130
whenever the missus is out
with the fandoms or with
the family and Bakersfield,

23
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,520
you know what I mean? It's
perfect. Yeah. It's uh,

24
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,570
it's a very underappreciated product.
You know, women that women should,

25
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,330
women that are afraid that their
husbands are cheating and all that shit,

26
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:49,470
they should be giving their husbands
these fucking flashlights. Come on.

27
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,490
You imagine the amount that the
percentage of, of cheating that would,

28
00:01:53,491 --> 00:01:56,550
it would cut out instantly.
Cut out a lot of it.

29
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:01,410
But I think a lot of cheating is
psychological too, but I think overall,

30
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,630
generally if you got a wife that was,
yeah,

31
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,570
of course you're not gonna let you cheat,

32
00:02:06,571 --> 00:02:08,970
but she was giving you
like every week she just,

33
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,930
it was part of the groceries and shit.
She brought him out in fighter tortillas.

34
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,050
Fucking Cup of flashlights.
You're like, I wanted six.

35
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,920
You only got to show what are you
going to be gone for two weeks,

36
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,300
what am I going to do? What
to do? Like a half an hour.

37
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,540
You're not down with cleaning
them. You don't clean them.
Yeah. That's the problem.

38
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,150
They need to make them so cheap that you
could buy them for it. You know what?

39
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:33,690
For five bucks, Shit,
I'll buy like six. Well,

40
00:02:33,691 --> 00:02:38,691
if you think about how much it costs
for if a dude like essentially pays for

41
00:02:39,571 --> 00:02:40,950
sex,
you know,

42
00:02:40,951 --> 00:02:44,070
if a dude takes a girl out and she fucks
him because he took her out to dinner.

43
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,550
Yeah. How much is that? That's gotta
be like a couple hundred bucks,

44
00:02:47,551 --> 00:02:50,480
at least right flashlights pending.

45
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,690
Take a girl to like swingers or something.
You can get away with like 60 bucks.

46
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,720
You don't want it to go to Katana.
It's Katana is your fuck.

47
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:01,360
It's like three 25 and Oh,
you've got to Fogo de Chao. Damn.

48
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:02,590
You better have just gotten paid.

49
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,840
Isn't it funny when you're dating people
and you barely know him and you have to

50
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:10,930
spend a lot of money on him to impress
them and how cool is it when you get to

51
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:13,810
that point where you could just,
you know, what do you want to eat?

52
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,650
And they're like, I don't care. And you're
like, El Pollo Loco, you'll fuck out.

53
00:03:17,651 --> 00:03:18,484
I'm like,
Damn.

54
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:21,860
Like when you cross that threshold of
going to El Pollo Loco on anything,

55
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:24,910
like a big deal. Like you don't have
to impress the bitch. It's nice. Wow.

56
00:03:24,911 --> 00:03:29,580
That's crazy. So is it like, do
you, do you think, why? Why, I mean,

57
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:33,760
why is, why is it so important for guys
to impress girls where they take them?

58
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,590
Well, the girls want to be impressed, man.

59
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:39,730
No girl wants to get picked up and I
had shit jalopy and taken her Donald's

60
00:03:39,731 --> 00:03:40,900
right.
That's not going to happen.

61
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:45,340
I know girl is going to be down with
that unless she's like 16 and she's just

62
00:03:45,341 --> 00:03:49,840
happy that motherfucker has a car and you
know what I mean? They'll go anywhere.

63
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,750
Yeah. Girls are not really
into dudes with fucked up cars.

64
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,530
You really can't keep that going for too
long. You gotta be a bad motherfucker.

65
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:00,960
Of course, in a fucked up car. Yeah,
it's a weird thing. And then you know,

66
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,960
it's like no one wants to say, I
mean, it's not entirely common.

67
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:05,860
It's not every woman.

68
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:09,430
It's on every woman in the world who
only wants guys to do that, you know?

69
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:13,150
And a fucked up house man. How long
you've known me for a long Goddamn time.

70
00:04:13,151 --> 00:04:16,690
How fucking nasty my house,
my house is nasty.

71
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,680
Up until up until like 45 years ago,

72
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,920
I was living in basically a doll house.

73
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:29,060
It was a one bedroom house.
It was the smallest house ever was a war.

74
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,960
It was a house, but it was a one
bedroom house and had the living room,

75
00:04:31,961 --> 00:04:34,900
had a bedroom, tiny. And when
I first moved to Hollywood,

76
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:38,570
I moved with a buddy of mine,
James. We split that motherfucker.

77
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,700
My whole existence was the bedroom and
there's a whole existence was the living

78
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:46,240
room is Christ. Oh, let me get
the commercials out of the way.

79
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:47,870
We've got to keep going with that thought.
This,

80
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,740
I got to get a more effective way
of delivering commercials. Oh,

81
00:04:50,741 --> 00:04:51,580
my tee shirt company.

82
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,540
Hire primate.com hire-primary.com
people keep asking me about it.

83
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,250
I hardly ever talk about it,
but yeah,

84
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:02,310
I have a tee shirt company and it's all
a psychedelic mushrooms and monkeys.

85
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,600
It's all like monkeys playing
chess monkeys and aliens
playing chess monkey's in

86
00:05:07,601 --> 00:05:12,550
space. It's just weird. Psychedelic
monkey imagery. That's brilliant,

87
00:05:12,551 --> 00:05:16,300
man. That's all I've been
fascinated. Even selling a lot. Yeah,

88
00:05:16,301 --> 00:05:18,190
they sell pretty well,
but I don't tell people about them.

89
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:22,810
I'm like the worst a advertiser ever
when it comes to that. I just saw,

90
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,700
I always feel weird,
you know,

91
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,170
talking about shit you're selling like
so I don't do such a good job of selling

92
00:05:29,171 --> 00:05:31,150
shit.
You do a great job at that.

93
00:05:31,151 --> 00:05:35,440
Mushroom had stuff that's
mushroom Alpha brain.

94
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,960
What is the mushroom that I'm
thinking about? Shroom tech. Yes. Yes.

95
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:43,460
You do a great job because every time I'm
here and you'd give that commercial it.

96
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,960
You're so passionate about
it. You know what, you,

97
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,130
you're not only you're
passionate about it, but it's,

98
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,890
it's a totally different commercial.

99
00:05:50,891 --> 00:05:54,550
Every time you're telling people
to go make their own shit,

100
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,590
they're not necessarily, you
know, that's, that's, yeah.

101
00:05:57,591 --> 00:06:01,280
Well I eat the most important thing for
me always with any of these things is to

102
00:06:01,281 --> 00:06:03,350
make sure that no one feels
like they're getting ripped off.

103
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,920
I do not want a single person having
a feeling like they're being ripped.

104
00:06:06,921 --> 00:06:10,490
Totally. That's the most important thing
for me. Everything else is secondary.

105
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,090
So there's that,
you know,

106
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:15,950
and then there's the way we have it
set up where anything you buy from

107
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:20,240
[inaudible] dot com like when you buy
like the first order of 30 pills of

108
00:06:20,241 --> 00:06:22,550
anything, there's a hundred
percent money back guarantee.

109
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,080
You don't even have to bring it back.

110
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:28,070
All you have to do is say this shroom
Tech Shit didn't do enough for me or this

111
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:29,600
Alpha brain did do nothing for me.

112
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:34,550
These are the best nutrients and
supplements available for this,

113
00:06:34,551 --> 00:06:38,390
for the, for these particular functions,
for nootropics and for, for the,

114
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,950
for sports athletics.

115
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:42,650
When it comes to like a performance
and endurance supplements.

116
00:06:42,651 --> 00:06:45,740
Shroom tech is like one of the best
endurance supplements I've ever tried.

117
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:49,280
One of the only ones that I've ever tried.
It's super effective.

118
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:53,550
It's got a lot of B 12 and eight in
this quarter steps mushrooms and it's,

119
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,320
it's fucking,

120
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,290
it works great for me and I get a lot
of reports from people that use it for

121
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:01,850
working out and it's crazy and they love
it when people say as I've always been.

122
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:04,540
I've been at vitamin freak
before we even started here.

123
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:08,870
I've always been a massive vitamin freak
still. You influenced me a lot, ma'am.

124
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:09,370
I'm on,

125
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:14,300
I'm on honest since serious diet
vitamin plants since I was 22,

126
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:19,040
23. I was just obsessed
with it and um, I just,

127
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,140
I just wanted to, it was all about, uh,

128
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:26,300
making sure any cancer,
cancer phobia,

129
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:31,510
making sure your body gets the
building blocks it needs to stay young,

130
00:07:31,521 --> 00:07:33,020
looking as long as possible.

131
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,800
I want her to look good as long as
possible and drag it out. You know,

132
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:37,850
I'm not ready to throw in the towel.

133
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:40,280
So that was a lot of that
going on on my right.

134
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,490
And I would get into arguments with, with
people and they wouldn't, they'd say,

135
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:47,500
how do you know what works man? How do you
know what works? And I'm like, well, um,

136
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:52,340
you know, I'm doing all I can but if
you want me to break it down for you,

137
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,900
how does it work?
Uh,

138
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:58,280
is there a difference between
chocolate cake and a chicken salad?

139
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:02,990
Okay. Yes. Yes. What's the difference
between chocolate cake and chicken salad?

140
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,860
The nutrition. What's
nutrition? It means what?

141
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:11,420
What nutrients are in the
chicken and in the south. Oh,

142
00:08:11,421 --> 00:08:12,590
so now what are nutrients?

143
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,590
They've isolated these nutrients that
you can take massive amounts of them.

144
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:23,090
The only way it wouldn't work is if they
weren't actually putting those vitamins

145
00:08:23,091 --> 00:08:26,840
and minerals in there. If it was just
some fake ass milk powder or whatever,

146
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,220
then yeah, it's not doing shit. But I'm
doing what I can to make sure, you know,

147
00:08:31,221 --> 00:08:35,840
cause there are nutrients and we have,
science has known this is basic shit.

148
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:40,930
Nutrients are needed and and all disease
is caused by a deficiency of certain

149
00:08:41,601 --> 00:08:44,210
nutrients.
It's really basic shit.

150
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,000
If that vitamins I'm taking,

151
00:08:47,001 --> 00:08:49,850
if they really are what it says
they are on the bottle for sure.

152
00:08:49,851 --> 00:08:53,710
It's good for you.
Absolutely. Yeah. I've uh,

153
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,460
I've always been into vitamins,
but when I started hanging out with you,

154
00:08:56,461 --> 00:09:00,180
that's when I really kicked my vitamin
game up a notch because I was like,

155
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:01,650
this mother fucker,
it's like super,

156
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,470
you were real disciplined about
it and I was like, you know what?

157
00:09:04,471 --> 00:09:05,880
I need to be as disciplined as he is.

158
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,860
That's really a smart
thing to do because I know,

159
00:09:07,861 --> 00:09:11,790
I feel I took two weeks off of vitamins
recently just for whatever I just said,

160
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:14,610
let me see what it feels like to
take two weeks off of vitamins.

161
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:19,710
I took two whole weeks off of vitamins
and dude, I felt lethargic. I just didn't,

162
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,850
I didn't feel connected. Right. Be Like
I was not getting enough from my food.

163
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,900
And I'm a, I mean,
pretty clean. I mean, I,

164
00:09:25,901 --> 00:09:27,840
I've fucked with some
cheeseburgers every now and then,

165
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:32,160
but I'm eating a lot of salads, a lot of
Greens, a lot of Kale shakes and shit.

166
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,660
Still do not feel as good as I do when
I'm taking like basic multivitamins,

167
00:09:36,661 --> 00:09:39,000
multi minerals.
I take a lot of fish oil,

168
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,190
take like 10,000
milligrams official a day.

169
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,640
And then I take these nootropics and
of all the nootropics I've ever found,

170
00:09:44,641 --> 00:09:46,680
two of them have worked great for me.

171
00:09:46,681 --> 00:09:50,880
One of them was called neuro one
and that's bill Romanowski stuff.

172
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,150
I told you about this right? Any,
there was a guy named no name,

173
00:09:54,151 --> 00:09:58,780
he's a Dj up in San Francisco and he
became friends with Roman Nowatzski Roman

174
00:09:58,781 --> 00:10:02,820
house. Can, you know, he's taking like a
bunch of head injuries from concussions.

175
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,730
So he came out with some
shit called neuro one.

176
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:10,200
And it's like all the best nutrients
for your mind. All the, you know,

177
00:10:10,201 --> 00:10:14,880
like it's very similar, very similar,
but it's Kinda like a caffeine to it too.

178
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:18,820
It's good. It's like a little bit, a
little bit caffeinated, I believe. Here's,

179
00:10:18,821 --> 00:10:20,850
here's the little, uh, build knowledge.

180
00:10:20,851 --> 00:10:25,350
I'd like to share with all the Jujitsu
players out there. Guys that train MMA,

181
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,290
this is some serious knowledge.
Believe me, trust me.

182
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:33,300
You want to keep ringworm away.
Take acid office every day.

183
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:39,380
Thousand percent 1000% of you take an
acid off lists every day or eat a big

184
00:10:40,411 --> 00:10:43,770
thing of yogurt everyday cause that's
why yogurt is good for you because of the

185
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:46,710
active cultures, the friendly
bacteria, that's what you need.

186
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:51,300
Acid office is bacteria that your body
needs. You actually need bacteria.

187
00:10:51,301 --> 00:10:53,380
Believe it or not. You know, I thought
it was kind of weird. I don't know.

188
00:10:53,381 --> 00:10:57,840
There's good bacteria. The fuck does
that mean, but yes, unless the signs,

189
00:10:57,841 --> 00:11:02,070
unless they're lying to me that we
need friendly bacteria and acid.

190
00:11:02,071 --> 00:11:03,770
Doubtless that's what
friendly bacteria is.

191
00:11:03,771 --> 00:11:08,771
We're actually taking pills that contain
millions and millions of good bacteria.

192
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,750
And what it does, this
is, this is what I read.

193
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:18,490
It eats the uh,
ring ringworm attaches to your skin.

194
00:11:18,491 --> 00:11:20,520
It eats certain things on your skin.

195
00:11:20,521 --> 00:11:24,750
So ring that fungus will grow and
it's eating something on your skin.

196
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:28,740
Acidophilus eat,
ring warm food first.

197
00:11:28,741 --> 00:11:32,550
So ringworm can attacked
itself as itself too,

198
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:37,110
and it has nothing to eat. So you never
get ringworm and at it sounds crazy.

199
00:11:37,111 --> 00:11:40,620
There's guys how that, how do you
know where's the proof? Trust me.

200
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,000
Trust and have used to get really warm
all the God damn time. I was always,

201
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:49,650
I had Lamisil ready to go and if you get
really warm, get Lamisil, don't get low.

202
00:11:49,651 --> 00:11:54,370
Trump man, don't get nothing else.
But Lamisil cream, you're grinded

203
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:57,160
in with acute tip.
That shit will kill it in five days.

204
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,820
You want to have ringworm for three weeks
or a month. Use Loma trend or that, uh,

205
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,770
any other shit. The only thing that
works is Lamisil. Trust me the cream.

206
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:08,050
Oh my God. That stuff. I got Loma trend,

207
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:13,330
go back to the store and get
Lamisil. The cream. Trust me on that.

208
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:18,400
And you know, I used to get ringworm all
the God damn time God at Exxon jocks,

209
00:12:18,401 --> 00:12:20,050
man with the g,
believe it or not rent.

210
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:23,280
Lauren was just like once every
three or four months, God damn it.

211
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:26,800
And I'm out of training for like three
weeks or whatever cause I wasn't using

212
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:31,570
Lamisil, it wasn't out yet. And then
I read somewhere that acid off lists,

213
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,720
um, eats, uh, bring one food.

214
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:38,700
I don't know where the hell I read it.
I just read it and I,

215
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:42,730
it made sense to me and we should
probably Google this little yeah,

216
00:12:42,731 --> 00:12:46,610
look at you know, what? Look at it.
Okay. Yeah. But you're right. Right.

217
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,320
Once you start and you run it
when anytime I get ringworm,

218
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,040
it's when I run out of Acidophilus and
I'm too God damn lazy to go to the store

219
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,760
and I let it, I don't go to the store
for like a week. Boom rain. Where am I?

220
00:12:57,761 --> 00:13:01,900
My arm somewhere. I know it
works 1 million percent. Yeah.

221
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:07,780
How does it look? A little
advice for y'all? How do you
spell acidophilus? A c. I. D.

222
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:11,320
O. P. H. I. L.

223
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:12,530
Okay.

224
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:13,970
You or some shit like that.

225
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,280
I got lost at the hand.
Yeah, he did a little bit.

226
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:23,923
Okay.

227
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,680
Hmm. Yeah, this is a,

228
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:29,610
yeah.

229
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:33,030
Well, I'm sure there's something that's
going to explain it to us technically,

230
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:38,290
but basically that's one of the home
remedies to cure ringworm is that yogurt

231
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,460
and it prevents it.

232
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:45,600
If I'm on ringworm and or a an acid
office for a year straight guarantee,

233
00:13:45,601 --> 00:13:47,760
I going to get ringworm.
There's no way. Yeah,

234
00:13:47,761 --> 00:13:50,070
well I haven't had ringworm
in years. It's, it's true.

235
00:13:50,071 --> 00:13:53,760
And one of the other things are taking
another form of a live culture is

236
00:13:53,761 --> 00:13:57,870
Kombucha tea. That's an easy for me, I
liked the way it tastes. You've had those,

237
00:13:57,871 --> 00:13:59,220
right?
Those big synergies.

238
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:03,220
I think I've had one in the Ed tech
kind of an acquired taste, right.

239
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,430
It's like you swallow it a little bit
of loads in there. There's some like,

240
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,280
I mean there's like some live
organisms you're swallowing.

241
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:14,250
Like I tried to get Anthony Giordano on,
he was like, oh I can't get through that.

242
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,780
You'll read your
swallowing the live thing.

243
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,660
You are swallowing some like live loads.

244
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:22,980
We're still in the middle of
this commercial. Tactically,
uh, go to Joe Rogan.

245
00:14:22,981 --> 00:14:23,431
Not Net.

246
00:14:23,431 --> 00:14:26,910
Click on the link for Alpha brain and a
written the code name rug and save 10%

247
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:30,000
we've, we've said enough about
nootropics. You know what it is folks,

248
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,850
and if you're interested in it, you
should go read about it. Google it,

249
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:35,790
and if you think that our
stuff is too expensive,

250
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:39,240
please just steal the ingredient. Let's
go make your own. I don't care. Just,

251
00:14:39,241 --> 00:14:42,080
I don't want anybody feeling ripped off,
but if you want to buy it and it,

252
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,420
it is good and I use it.
I use it on a regular basis.

253
00:14:45,421 --> 00:14:48,810
I use it before anything important for
my show. When I film my show in Atlanta,

254
00:14:48,811 --> 00:14:51,980
it took four of those bitches.
I'm like, let's, I want to be

255
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,990
fired.
I want to be on all cylinders.

256
00:14:53,991 --> 00:14:57,200
I 100% believe in it and if you don't,

257
00:14:57,201 --> 00:15:00,590
you can always get your money back
first 30 pills, he just send it back.

258
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,460
You don't even have to send it back.

259
00:15:01,461 --> 00:15:04,760
Rather you just say it sucked and we
send you money back. That's how I feel.

260
00:15:04,761 --> 00:15:09,140
Exactly. That's, I could easily
charge 20 bucks, 25 bucks,

261
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:12,620
30 bucks a month for your membership on
my website for all the techniques that I

262
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:13,280
upload.

263
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:18,140
I talked for 99 I could have
went nine 99 or 1199 easily.

264
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:21,830
You don't want anybody to feel ripped off.
Not only that,

265
00:15:21,831 --> 00:15:24,390
I don't want to hear any complaints.
Yes, me too. You know what I mean?

266
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,820
Anytime someone complains about,

267
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,980
cause they're basically buying episodes
that are filled with technique and I put

268
00:15:30,981 --> 00:15:34,490
them out every two to three
weeks. I just, you know, it's,

269
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:39,480
it's a lot of work and every now and then,
uh,

270
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:42,320
it, the episodes come out late and
the guy will come and go on the board.

271
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,390
What the fuck man?
Like dude,

272
00:15:44,391 --> 00:15:49,391
you're paying for 99 for
everything I teach at school.

273
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:52,790
It's not separate techniques that I
film specifically for the website.

274
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:57,740
It's the techniques that I'm teaching
to my students at headquarters that that

275
00:15:57,741 --> 00:16:01,010
gets filled in and every technique
I teach goes up on the website.

276
00:16:01,011 --> 00:16:06,011
You have access to the whole system for
four 99 shut the fuck up for 99 a month.

277
00:16:07,351 --> 00:16:10,330
There's really not that much money.
When you consider how much Jujitsu cost,

278
00:16:10,331 --> 00:16:13,020
what is it, a cheap school,
100 bucks a month cheaper.

279
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:17,980
The most inexpensive like a hundred
right. And I tried to 130 a month. Yeah.

280
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:23,120
There's a lot of schools that charge one
90 to 10 over 200 they make you sign a

281
00:16:23,121 --> 00:16:27,800
year contract or you don't even want
to talk to you. You know, I, you know,

282
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:32,130
130th fair. I was charging 105
for a while, but you know what I,

283
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:36,020
in almost 10 years,
I went from 105 to 130 no big deal.

284
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:39,650
The big deal and this new space is
expensive and it's fucking big man.

285
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:44,390
The legend legends is fucking huge as
far as like gyms in la where you can get

286
00:16:44,391 --> 00:16:48,710
like everything done. Damn, that's a gym.
We can get everything done. You know,

287
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:53,570
that's a big wrestling class plus a roof.

288
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,410
I really,

289
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:57,970
I really like watching Chris Riley
train goes to Matt and Chris Riley's.

290
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,100
He's a bad motherfucker when it comes
to [inaudible]. He's very tactical,

291
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:04,820
very smart, very intelligent guy. And
look at the guys who brought up, uh, uh,

292
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,270
Chris Brady,
one of the amateurs that uh,

293
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:11,450
he bought his third pro fight Saturday.
Man,

294
00:17:11,451 --> 00:17:14,780
his standup is so wicked and I
just gave him his purple belt.

295
00:17:14,781 --> 00:17:18,680
He just submitted a guy with a good
team, you know, so he's a good dude too.

296
00:17:18,681 --> 00:17:23,290
I love that kid. I got, got, got a
lot of good guys at that. Jim Collins,

297
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:28,370
who by how nice is that guy? The whole
gym is just filled with cool guys.

298
00:17:28,371 --> 00:17:33,350
Chris, Chris, the MMA squad, they're
all coming up strong, like a force.

299
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,770
It's taken a while to build them.
Then they got to get,

300
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,610
most of the guys were strikers first
like Alan Gabon, Eddie Jackson,

301
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:45,230
Cubana and a lot of fights.
Right. And how many, I don't know,

302
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:48,320
but a whole bunch. And, and uh,
thanked them with Chris Brady.

303
00:17:48,321 --> 00:17:50,220
They were just pure strikers for years.

304
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,840
We were both there that were in the
same building. They just weren't taken.

305
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,000
They really wanted me to just mostly time.

306
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:02,210
And then this was like 2005 2006
and as MMA rose as the UFC rose,

307
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:06,570
they started at the gym. I got
maybe I should do in the, you know,

308
00:18:06,571 --> 00:18:08,640
Eddie's teaching Jujitsu,
maybe I should just jump in.

309
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,560
So they finally jumped in like
four years ago. I've had first.

310
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:18,800
So now I got these vicious strikers.
They're,

311
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:22,290
they're an Allen as well.
I gave him his purple belt as well.

312
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,540
They're really good at do Jetson now too.

313
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:27,900
It's fun watching this and this
is just the beginning, you know,

314
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:32,990
it must be really satisfying and watching
people like from the time they first

315
00:18:33,151 --> 00:18:34,560
came to you when they didn't know much,

316
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,160
to watch them start to tap people and
submit people watching the progress,

317
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,990
it's amazing.
Must be incredible.

318
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:44,220
You know what's weird about that is when
a guide comes to me and joins my class

319
00:18:44,221 --> 00:18:47,340
and it's his first day Ma,
my inside,

320
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,490
my initial reaction when someone comes
and I meet him for the first time,

321
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:54,030
I want them to say they've
been training a year or two.

322
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:57,600
It just gonna make my job easier if
they have some kind of base going on,

323
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,500
some wrestling. Um, but uh,

324
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:07,020
but the guys had come in with zero
experience, 100% green. I'm like,

325
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,790
Ooh,
this is going to be a hard one.

326
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:11,610
But the basically retarded
on the ground I crippled.

327
00:19:11,611 --> 00:19:15,510
It's like you re going through rehab with
them putting their legs are just like,

328
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:18,960
they have no clue. But
when those guys, when they,

329
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:21,300
when those guys get good and
they start tapping people out,

330
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:24,060
it feels so much better.
The,

331
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:28,800
I know I took them from a cripple
and other tap and dude's out mad.

332
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,860
That happens a lot and that feels
really, really awesome. And it's,

333
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,470
I see it so much that when
guys come up to me and they'd,

334
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:37,440
they're all pumped up and I
see how enthusiastic they are.

335
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,030
And I know they got the fire.

336
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:43,740
I know because some guys come in and
they don't really want a roll or first

337
00:19:43,741 --> 00:19:46,260
couple of days they're taking easy.
They're sitting on the side,

338
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,030
they're kind of just, you know, you know,

339
00:19:48,031 --> 00:19:51,310
dipping their feet in the water a
little bit and they'd taken their time.

340
00:19:51,311 --> 00:19:54,570
And then, you know what, let me, let me
get fundamental fundamental three months,

341
00:19:54,571 --> 00:19:58,170
a fundamental classes out of the
way. Then I might spar, I don't know.

342
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:02,670
And then there's guys with no
experience at all. They come in,

343
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:05,850
they've had like three or four beginner's
classes and I make them take 24

344
00:20:05,851 --> 00:20:08,910
beginner's classes before
they can take my classes.

345
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:10,860
There's some guys that come to me,
you know,

346
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:15,630
three or four classes and they're just
so down. Like I won't, I won't subject,

347
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:15,980
uh,

348
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:19,260
a veteran with one of them when they're
exchanging techniques and we're drilling

349
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:22,150
because it slows everyone down.
The beginners classes. So you know,

350
00:20:22,151 --> 00:20:25,860
that the strategies, the terminology,
all that shit. So you don't slow us down.

351
00:20:25,861 --> 00:20:30,270
In the advanced classes, we moved really
fast. I'm 24 beginner classes is enough,

352
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,560
you know.
But there's some guy,

353
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:34,710
I'll let you roll if you want a role
after the technique and you want to hang

354
00:20:34,711 --> 00:20:35,430
out in role.

355
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:39,240
When those guys come up to me and they
asked me and you know I've only had five

356
00:20:39,241 --> 00:20:43,980
beginner classes, but can I
roll? I'm like, dude, you're
gonna have so much fun, man.

357
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:48,230
You have the right attitude,
right? Like what? What role

358
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,760
means for folks who
don't know is alive spar,

359
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,200
I means you try to choke each other.

360
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:56,830
Do you pay real close attention
to a guy's first role ever?

361
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:59,740
Do you have like guys
that you see in Jenny? No.

362
00:20:59,741 --> 00:21:02,890
This is going to be the first time he's
ever rolled your watch them closer? No.

363
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:07,630
Well I can't tell. I can't tell you
that. I remember anybody's first role.

364
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:12,770
It's almost like it's going to
suck really bad for a while,

365
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:13,601
for three months.

366
00:21:13,601 --> 00:21:16,330
It takes three months for a guy
to come in and not know anything,

367
00:21:16,331 --> 00:21:19,360
never played a sport in his life.
You come in,

368
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:23,590
your first month is going to seem like
it's going to be like trigonometry.

369
00:21:23,591 --> 00:21:27,640
You're going to go holy shit.
But it's just as easy as learning.

370
00:21:27,641 --> 00:21:31,630
The abcs is just as easy as the
first day I had learning the abcs,

371
00:21:31,631 --> 00:21:34,390
your grown adult,
and somehow you didn't learn how to read.

372
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,160
It's going to be hard in the beginning.

373
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:40,690
You've got to learn 26 letters and then
you put them together and you form work

374
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:44,560
and then a sentence that's
way like it seems so complex,

375
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:47,990
but after three months babies can do this.

376
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,970
It's the same thing with Hugh Jitsu.
It's just as easy.

377
00:21:51,971 --> 00:21:56,650
If you could learn the abcs, you can
do the Jujitsu, so after three months,

378
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:59,380
that's the point where I
notice people start getting,

379
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:03,190
they start getting the taps in because
in the beginning it's like you just

380
00:22:03,191 --> 00:22:06,880
joined a league or you just joined a
class and everyone's really good at quake

381
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:09,730
and they've all been playing quake two,
three years straight,

382
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:11,290
five years and 10 years,

383
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:15,160
and the [inaudible] has been teaching
for or playing quake for 20 years.

384
00:22:15,161 --> 00:22:17,980
Motherfucker helped invent that shit.
He's a programmer,

385
00:22:17,981 --> 00:22:22,240
shit back in the day and then you come in,
you're going to get killed on quick,

386
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,840
you're going to get Jack, you're not
going to kill anybody for a while,

387
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:29,590
but it hurts you just as
much physical physically.

388
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,490
You're not going to get hurt in Jiu
Jitsu. You tap. No one gets hurt. I mean,

389
00:22:33,491 --> 00:22:35,300
you get hurt just as much as you know,

390
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:39,040
playing basketball or whatever
we said that before. But um,

391
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:41,120
especially if you're all smart.
Yeah,

392
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:45,250
I've got to learn how to not muscle
things don't, don't go crazy.

393
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,430
You got to learn how to go full
clip, but use technique. Yes.

394
00:22:49,431 --> 00:22:51,850
Some people are tests still terrified.

395
00:22:51,851 --> 00:22:54,430
They look at Jujitsu and
it's terrifying to them.

396
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:58,600
It's incredible how terrifying it
is. The people. And it shouldn't be.

397
00:22:58,601 --> 00:23:03,310
It's so that people need to understand
that most of the guys are just

398
00:23:03,311 --> 00:23:08,010
sweethearts and nerves to train. They're
just, well, I think people in general, um,

399
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:12,180
have issues with human conflict.
They're scared of conflict of care,

400
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:14,650
scared of someone beating
them up. We are, you know,

401
00:23:14,651 --> 00:23:19,030
and a lot of us who got into martial
arts like me and I know like you, we,

402
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,940
we really, you know, we got bullied
a lot. We were younger, we'd go,

403
00:23:21,941 --> 00:23:25,360
we got in positions where we didn't know
if we could defend ourselves. You know,

404
00:23:25,361 --> 00:23:25,840
that's like,

405
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,290
that's one of the reasons why guys get
into martial arts in the first place.

406
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:32,610
Yeah, man, my first day. It's important.

407
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,780
It's an important thing for
I think for a man to learn.

408
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,450
It really is absolutely for,
it should be standard.

409
00:23:37,451 --> 00:23:39,940
It's your big like in PE class standard,

410
00:23:39,941 --> 00:23:41,900
everybody has got to learn
how to defend myself.

411
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:47,010
I didn't teach taekwondo for that long.
I taught like mostly uh,

412
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:51,320
like full time from like 19 to like 22.
And that's when I stopped.

413
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,830
So I didn't have like a lot of
students that got real good.

414
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:59,690
But I did have one and it was
a girl who was this really shy,

415
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:03,500
awkward girl and she was really like,

416
00:24:03,501 --> 00:24:05,780
she was really intense.
Like she,

417
00:24:05,781 --> 00:24:07,880
like she didn't wear any
makeup and she was like,

418
00:24:07,881 --> 00:24:09,620
I don't really know what her deal was.

419
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:14,540
My whole interaction with her was just in,
in teaching or in the class,

420
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:18,950
but she was like so intense man.
She wanted to learn so hard.

421
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,750
Like she was like so focused on it.

422
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:24,350
She was like really shy and kind of weird
and kind of embarrassed and I worked

423
00:24:24,351 --> 00:24:28,880
with her a lot because she would like
want to enter into tournament's and I took

424
00:24:28,881 --> 00:24:32,840
her from being a white belt to being,
this girl won this tournament.

425
00:24:32,841 --> 00:24:36,050
She won a tournament.
I think she won like as a blue belt,

426
00:24:36,051 --> 00:24:39,920
a green belt or a blue belt. But I had
basically taught her the whole way.

427
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:45,050
I had basically taught her the whole
way and watching this, this kid,

428
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,610
it's like real awkward kit,

429
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,770
like learn how to get enough confidence
to go out there and enter into a martial

430
00:24:51,771 --> 00:24:55,490
arts tournament and actually win and like
kicked this other chick's ass and like

431
00:24:55,491 --> 00:24:58,610
go after like this did the
whole thing to her was like,

432
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:03,850
it was so crazy in an empowering to watch
someone go from being a complete total

433
00:25:05,301 --> 00:25:09,200
novice and to watch just the
stuff that I put in their head.

434
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:10,880
Just the training that she did with me.

435
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,540
She went on to become like really
good like in just a couple of years.

436
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:16,970
It was wild.
It was wild to watch.

437
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:22,040
It was crazy satisfying
with Chris Brady again,

438
00:25:22,131 --> 00:25:26,030
he's one of that. Chris Riley's Muy
Thai prodigies. He's, you know, he,

439
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:29,150
I just gave him his purple belt.
We were working on like,

440
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:32,840
I'm not very good at the RM and gear team,
but we started three months ago.

441
00:25:32,841 --> 00:25:35,930
I really started adding it
in and I'm not that good.

442
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,970
I started adding it into a weekly
workouts, just working on the squeeze.

443
00:25:40,971 --> 00:25:41,330
It's getting,

444
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:46,330
putting people in the guard
arm and Guillotine cinched
in and the guy on top has

445
00:25:46,641 --> 00:25:49,480
to defend and the guy on the bottom is
working on his sleeves, were just working.

446
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,700
That working, the ending of that
guillotine. I'm not that good at it,

447
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:56,420
but I didn't want my guys to be stuck
at it too and the and the arm and

448
00:25:56,421 --> 00:26:00,920
guillotine. Any gay teens
are so important, especially
in Nma and the scrambles.

449
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,770
You really don't,
you really can't set up a good team.

450
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:06,860
The gates and you just got to snatch
it and it's gotta be under the Chin and

451
00:26:06,861 --> 00:26:09,410
then you got to know how to close
it and twist it and tinny love.

452
00:26:09,411 --> 00:26:13,700
Nate Diaz is bad ass.
Was that where he got it with one arm?

453
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:17,420
He had one arm just since through and he
knew he was not going to lose that arm.

454
00:26:17,421 --> 00:26:20,840
His squeezes tight and he tucked that
one on through and then he adjusted his

455
00:26:20,841 --> 00:26:25,841
hands and for people to train to get to
like if you've trained over 10 years,

456
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,280
maybe even at five years,

457
00:26:28,281 --> 00:26:32,090
you can tell when a guy owns a move,

458
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:37,070
like before he got the tap, the way he
wrapped it up, the way he, cause it took,

459
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,700
you know when he wrapped up the neck it
probably took another 20 seconds to get

460
00:26:40,701 --> 00:26:44,050
the tap. Maybe something like that.
There's a battle. Got Something

461
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:48,060
pretty quick. It wasn't right away. He
was battling with it for awhile. Made me,

462
00:26:48,061 --> 00:26:50,280
I would say maybe 10 at the earliest,

463
00:26:50,281 --> 00:26:55,281
maybe 2015 but during that period when
Jamillah was fighting the gear team,

464
00:26:56,310 --> 00:27:01,170
you can just tell the way. Nick was like,
damn, I never do good things like that.

465
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,030
It's a one arm good team.

466
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:06,420
You know Einstein does one arm good
is the one that Chris Brady got it.

467
00:27:06,421 --> 00:27:11,070
Just a basic and Ghia team and you
see how long Nate's arms are too.

468
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,520
That's one of the bad. How's
things about, I was guilty and he,

469
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:15,960
he put Marcus Davis Hall
with a good team too. Yeah,

470
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,930
he catches a lot of guys with that.
That's his shit for sure.

471
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,620
It's tight when he mounts you
too. God dammit. That's what I,

472
00:27:22,621 --> 00:27:23,880
that's a thing of beauty.

473
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:28,110
That's beautiful and people that
don't train out there that try it.

474
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:32,220
You got to understand that. I'm just
like a video game. My video game analogy,

475
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:36,750
not everybody can,
even though most people,

476
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:41,780
most black belts can probably figure
out that guillotine and teach it that.

477
00:27:42,121 --> 00:27:47,121
What Nick Diaz is doing that to have
it down so good that you can put it on

478
00:27:47,371 --> 00:27:51,150
another black belt, a guy trained to
defend all that shit all the time.

479
00:27:51,151 --> 00:27:54,300
Defense is way easier than
off fence to pull it off.

480
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:58,200
You have to put so much time into that,

481
00:27:58,201 --> 00:28:00,550
move into that transition into the,

482
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:03,810
that movement in the squeeze and the bend.

483
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:08,280
There's so much that needs to be polished.
Not Very, there's not that. I mean,

484
00:28:08,281 --> 00:28:12,930
in the UFC I would say
maybe there's at Max, uh,

485
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:19,770
10 guys that have a guillotine as good
as Nate Diaz, like that one. I mean,

486
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,820
you just don't see it. Even 10
shields, Jake shields, you know,

487
00:28:23,821 --> 00:28:26,250
Jake shields is got a nasty
gear too. Yeah. But the one,

488
00:28:26,251 --> 00:28:31,140
the one that Nate did the one down so
good. You could do it with one arm. Well,

489
00:28:31,141 --> 00:28:33,630
Jake does the one arm. He, yeah,
you're right. You're right.

490
00:28:33,631 --> 00:28:36,750
I remember he got Nick Thompson with a
one arm. Yes, definitely. Definitely.

491
00:28:36,751 --> 00:28:38,580
I would say,
or it wasn't a drug for Jake.

492
00:28:38,581 --> 00:28:43,110
Shields has one of the best
squeezes in the game. Yeah,
sure. Caught Robbie Lawler.

493
00:28:43,111 --> 00:28:46,140
And with the [inaudible], he
gets a hold of next. It's,

494
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,320
he's a dangerous motherfucker.

495
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:51,780
The crazy thing about the guillotine is
it's probably the easiest choke to learn

496
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:56,620
yet. So few people have mastered it to
the point where they're finishing, uh,

497
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:59,220
people in big MMA fights,
but people don't realize.

498
00:28:59,221 --> 00:29:02,520
Also there's a whole bunch of weird
different grips that people use for these

499
00:29:02,521 --> 00:29:06,330
techniques to which greatly
alter the way you apply pressure.

500
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,030
It's all about what you're used to.
I mean,

501
00:29:09,031 --> 00:29:11,970
you could make really any grip
work cause there's probably about,

502
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:14,940
I'm going to say I'm just
throwing this number out,

503
00:29:14,941 --> 00:29:19,770
five to eight different gay teens
out there. Maybe there's four,

504
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:23,230
maybe there's not five off the top of
my head. Maybe there's more that I,

505
00:29:23,231 --> 00:29:26,040
I just lost track of.
There's the Marcella teen,

506
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:28,770
there's the regular Armand [inaudible],
there's the arm and gates in the den.

507
00:29:28,771 --> 00:29:31,320
He lives with the inverted Pretzel Grip.
Um,

508
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:34,140
there's de Verdad Pretzel
Grippers to Shit. Yeah.

509
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,370
I just watched a video of Marcello
explaining why he uses this grip for this

510
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:42,040
team and it makes a lot of sense.
I made a lot.

511
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:46,530
A lot of sense. When you go
in, right? You're going into
guys justice here, right?

512
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:49,000
They're going to defend like this,
right?

513
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:52,300
So they're going to hook the
outside that they're going to,

514
00:29:52,301 --> 00:29:55,230
they're going to be between you and
your arm right here. See that? Right?

515
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,660
So you make room and then you
could stick this one on top.

516
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:03,790
See if you were going to do, uh,
like let's say this grip here,

517
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,450
they're hands are right here.
They're stopped.

518
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,860
They're stopping for folks on Itunes,

519
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:12,100
we're describing a bunch of different
ways to squeeze someone's neck.

520
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:16,120
Do you understand? I told him I
need this space. If I go this way,

521
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,370
I need this space. But that's where
their hands are going to be, right?

522
00:30:19,371 --> 00:30:23,230
So Marcello's wise, he needs the
space in between my hand and the body.

523
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:28,170
I govern that. So even if you grab my
hand here, I could still pass this.

524
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:32,070
For the folks who are listening at home,
what he's doing is changing the way his,

525
00:30:32,071 --> 00:30:36,040
his hand is in relationship to his
body where you squeeze a person's neck,

526
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:40,310
it's all about squeezing their neck. It's,
it's amazing how technical over this.

527
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,350
So people really don't know how
technical it is. I mean the,

528
00:30:43,351 --> 00:30:48,080
the actual technique that's involved
in Jujitsu, it's, it's, it's,

529
00:30:48,081 --> 00:30:48,401
it's a,

530
00:30:48,401 --> 00:30:53,080
it's really an amazing and fascinating
sport cause it's like an expanded game of

531
00:30:53,081 --> 00:30:57,940
chess. It's more fascinating than
chess because, and you said this,

532
00:30:57,970 --> 00:30:59,420
you were the first person
to ever said that much.

533
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:03,190
Someone was talking about
Jujitsu be in chess and you said,

534
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:04,510
yeah,

535
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:09,370
but it's with chess pieces like
this piece can only go like there,

536
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:09,911
you know,

537
00:31:09,911 --> 00:31:14,911
or this piece can only though with Jujitsu
it's bodies and strength and all this

538
00:31:14,921 --> 00:31:18,550
other stuff. It's like you like it's way
crazier than chess. And I was like, yeah,

539
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:21,950
you know, you really stop and think
about chess. Checkers, competitive.

540
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:27,040
I mean you're, you're dealing with, I'm
thinking you're dealing with technique,

541
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,590
you're dealing with strategy
and he's dealing with patients.

542
00:31:29,591 --> 00:31:31,660
You're dealing with Breanne,
knowledge of positions,

543
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,330
knowledge of the next
step to the next step.

544
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:37,840
Knowledge of if this guy does try to
count and he's going to do this and then

545
00:31:37,841 --> 00:31:39,430
I'm going to do that.
And then if he does that,

546
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,070
the only thing left for him
is to leave this. You know,

547
00:31:42,071 --> 00:31:43,870
when you have these little steps
that you have in your head,

548
00:31:43,871 --> 00:31:46,300
if you're an intelligent person
and you could think far ahead,

549
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:48,970
and if you're going to go against the go,
doesn't have that,

550
00:31:48,971 --> 00:31:50,470
you'll always be one step ahead.

551
00:31:50,471 --> 00:31:53,920
So your mind is an important
factor in the whole equation.

552
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,630
It's not just about brute strength,

553
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:59,020
it's about knowledge and position and
keeping your fucking head together while

554
00:31:59,021 --> 00:32:02,110
it's all going on. For people
who don't train, man, God,

555
00:32:02,111 --> 00:32:05,860
you're missing out on a really fun
thing in life. It's a fun thing.

556
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:10,210
It's so weird fucking fun way to exercise.
I've said this before,

557
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:14,440
you find your nearest Jujitsu school. It
doesn't matter if it's 10th planet. Hey,

558
00:32:14,441 --> 00:32:17,680
if there's a 10 planets, schooling
your city, join it. Y'All, you know,

559
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:22,510
you're going to deal with a bunch of open
minded, fun, loving, uh, computer nerds,

560
00:32:22,511 --> 00:32:27,170
man that liked to, to play games of
death. You know what I mean? But fine.

561
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:30,190
If there's no 10 plan in
school, fine. Amy School,

562
00:32:30,191 --> 00:32:33,550
just any Jujitsu is better than
no Jujitsu. It's so much fun.

563
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:37,030
It's the ultimate video game. I always
say that, but man, it's so damn true.

564
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:40,100
And what ends up is you end

565
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:44,540
up the people that can hang with
sparring without getting, uh, you know,

566
00:32:44,541 --> 00:32:47,210
and they get tapped and they
don't get all crazy and all burnt.

567
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:52,010
Most people take it personal when they
get tapped it there, when they tap out,

568
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:56,000
they feel like their weakness has been
exposed and they run from the gym and

569
00:32:56,001 --> 00:32:58,520
they don't want to tap out in front
of other people. It's so crazy,

570
00:32:58,521 --> 00:32:59,450
their egos out of control.

571
00:32:59,451 --> 00:33:02,510
But the people that do stay are the
people that can handle getting tapped and

572
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:06,520
they keep their ego under control and
it's all, it's all a mental game. You,

573
00:33:06,521 --> 00:33:11,330
you end up with a great group of guys
that, you know, you could trust generally,

574
00:33:11,331 --> 00:33:14,050
you know, douchebags do filter
through, but generally they'll,

575
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:18,500
they'll end up getting cut out. You're
just left with a bunch of great guys,

576
00:33:18,501 --> 00:33:22,760
you know. And one thing,
one thing that, um, uh,

577
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,920
that, that, you know,

578
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:30,010
Jujitsu becomes so much a part of your
life that after five years all your

579
00:33:31,071 --> 00:33:32,450
friends train Jujitsu,

580
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:36,230
you end up like cutting out the friends
that really don't train that much and,

581
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:40,460
and most of your friends end up coming
from the Jujitsu circle cause there's

582
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:45,050
like a such a giant pool of great
dudes, you know, it's, it's amazing.

583
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,980
It is true. You know, and
uh, it's a lot of dudes who,

584
00:33:47,981 --> 00:33:51,290
I have a lot of friends that don't do
Jujitsu like Joey and Brian and Ari.

585
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:56,080
Joey wants to though he's,
he's been wanting to like
Joey's a big fan of Jujitsu.

586
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:59,710
If he was in shape, I bet
he would be into. Joey loves
Jujitsu. He's all about it.

587
00:33:59,711 --> 00:34:03,870
But you know, he's got a lot of shit going
on, man. The guy's a busy dude. You know,

588
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:05,650
he's busier than ever lately,

589
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,630
but the cool Joey's headline and
all over the country now he's,

590
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:12,910
he's headed down to, uh, if you want to
see Joe, he's in Scottsdale this weekend.

591
00:34:12,911 --> 00:34:15,160
Scottsdale, Arizona. I don't
know the name of the club,

592
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:19,570
but if you go to Joey's Twitter, I'm sure
he puts it up on his Twitter call them.

593
00:34:19,571 --> 00:34:22,470
Is that what you're saying? You
think your phone at work? Yeah.

594
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:26,860
I got two bars.
Give it a shot.

595
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:31,960
We have the most [inaudible]
one bar signals up your socket.

596
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,610
But uh, but anyway, Joe,

597
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:38,170
we got this gigantic fucking standing
ovation when we were in New York this

598
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:42,040
weekend. Man. People love that dude.
It was, it was amazing. I got it.

599
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:46,480
Here it was. It was incredible, man. He
went on stage. They were right at the top.

600
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:47,141
No,

601
00:34:47,141 --> 00:34:51,310
he didn't even go at the top when we had
Dunkin go up for us this time and that

602
00:34:51,311 --> 00:34:56,140
Joey and then Joey went up. God
Damn Dude, he fucking crushed it.

603
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:59,300
This is New York. Yeah.
This is like for a minute.

604
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,790
This is Joey standing on stage.

605
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:05,283
Dude,

606
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:10,120
that sounds like a Coldplay. Countless
ones. This is just Joey standing on stage.

607
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:14,620
That's all he's doing. He just walked
out onto the stage. You hearing this?

608
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:17,050
This goes on for a minute,

609
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,870
dude. That's something
like a phenomenon, right?

610
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,230
Yeah. And I go, wow,
that's incredible. That's,

611
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,940
that's some rock and roll comedy
right there. That was crazy.

612
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,040
You've been saying it forever
and you've known him longer

613
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:42,540
than I have and you've always said he
was the funniest guy on the planet and I

614
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:46,840
started to agree with you back in 2005
when I got to really get to know him and

615
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:51,840
it makes me funnier. Joey Diaz brings the
party. He makes me feel better. You know,

616
00:35:51,841 --> 00:35:55,380
it was really funny. I love
my manager. He's the best of,

617
00:35:55,381 --> 00:35:59,160
have never had another event, one manager
since the time I was an open miker.

618
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,470
But when we were talking about the show,
they were like,

619
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,100
we think you'd be better
if you got introduced off
camera. You know, if you just,

620
00:36:05,101 --> 00:36:05,934
you,

621
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,100
they just say your name and you come out
clean because otherwise like this guy's

622
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:13,530
introducing you and people like, who's
this guy? And I'm like, oh no, fuck away.

623
00:36:13,531 --> 00:36:16,170
Joey's pregnant me up.
Like Joey's bringing me up.

624
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:20,490
The Joey always brings me up
with Joe when I worked with Joey.

625
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:25,050
I have more fun when I work with Joey.
It's more laughter. It's more hugs,

626
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,820
it's more, everything's
funner. And you know,

627
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,890
you know when he says funniest is cause
you know he's known for the Joey karate

628
00:36:31,891 --> 00:36:35,250
reviews and all that stuff and,
and he says some funny ass shit.

629
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:39,060
But just like us, like when we were
talking about fighters, we can't,

630
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:42,750
we don't really say the same shit we
would if we weren't on air. Right.

631
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:43,621
You know what I mean?

632
00:36:43,621 --> 00:36:48,300
Cause cause the things guys say to each
other about a fight and about a fighter

633
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,870
that crushed,
we would never say like 70%.

634
00:36:51,871 --> 00:36:55,500
It's just like we're being real
on the phone. When Joey calls me,

635
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:58,590
he calls me Saturday,

636
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:03,540
he called the Saturday after the UFC
and he's fucking stoned to the gills.

637
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:08,390
Barely awake. He's like, he's like, I
can't even say it. I can't even say it.

638
00:37:08,391 --> 00:37:12,420
But he just crushes people.
Yeah.

639
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:15,570
You can't say what he says but
he's always saying it to be fun.

640
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,780
Funny Shit.
That

641
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:23,580
shit was so funny.
People will never get to,

642
00:37:23,581 --> 00:37:26,580
he never get to hear the best
shit shit that he could never say

643
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:33,140
only. And it's a fighter
like from like Uganda and he,

644
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:36,780
he's Joe is never going to run
into him and he's on his way out.

645
00:37:36,781 --> 00:37:39,870
Like he just got cut. It was a fighter
that just got cut and never had a chance.

646
00:37:39,871 --> 00:37:40,770
It will never come back.

647
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:45,030
The enjoyment then it might be
okay to give the green light dude.

648
00:37:45,031 --> 00:37:49,470
He could say shit onstage that no one
else could ever say stage. Exactly.

649
00:37:49,471 --> 00:37:53,980
He could say crazier shit stays in it.
Camp podcast on stage.

650
00:37:53,981 --> 00:37:55,460
You can get away with
staging and get away with it.

651
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:57,960
But on a podcast you've got
to represent you on stage.

652
00:37:57,961 --> 00:38:00,460
You could just be material
cause the real funny shit,

653
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,720
the Shit Talk Shit with your friends
on the street in New York when you're

654
00:38:03,721 --> 00:38:07,590
getting deep and there's no fucking
rules and there's no one's recording shit

655
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:10,710
dude,
one time of the Goddamn comedy store,

656
00:38:10,711 --> 00:38:13,270
Joey Diaz and this is in front
of a mixed audience, not just,

657
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:17,700
he's talking about some defensive
line and some strategy and football.

658
00:38:17,701 --> 00:38:22,140
There was a night of a thousand nigger
and he's saying this on stage in front of

659
00:38:22,141 --> 00:38:26,040
a, a mixed crowd. Joey Diaz crazy.

660
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:28,230
He doesn't give a fuck.
It was a long time.

661
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:33,200
He probably doesn't even remember that
there's so much of his best shit you'd

662
00:38:33,201 --> 00:38:34,950
have to like remind him of.
He's like,

663
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:40,110
he's so free flowing when you're so he
can just go on and on about any subject

664
00:38:40,121 --> 00:38:44,230
and it becomes hilarious. I think Joey
being, you know, a hundred percent Cuban,

665
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:46,900
I think a super Latin guy
with that New York. Oh yeah,

666
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:50,530
you can say Nipd g h I think
black people let him say,

667
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:53,010
are you really spelling it out?
Instead of saying it, dude,

668
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,460
I don't want people coming after me.
Dude.

669
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:58,820
It's become the new Mohamad

670
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:05,300
wouldn't even say that he met quite
to have never said Nig ga. Wow.

671
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:09,340
I won't go there. Wow. That's
amazing. What a powerful
word. Oh No, actually he did.

672
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:12,880
I'm sorry you wrote a song about it.
I was wrong.

673
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,490
For people who don't know Eddie is,

674
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:19,630
Eddie and I have been friends for a long
time and one time before I knew Eddie,

675
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:21,910
I would have advised
him against doing this.

676
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:29,430
He made a video and he made a video
of him playing a wrapper that whereas

677
00:39:29,831 --> 00:39:34,820
actually, whereas black face, and it
was, the concept's really fucking, it's,

678
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:37,660
it was pretty funny mad it,
but people got really mad at you.

679
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,550
People got really miss
playing the concept.

680
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:44,580
The concept was that this
guy was pretending that he
had Videle Lygo and that he

681
00:39:45,251 --> 00:39:49,330
was just, he had a cover his
whole body. Yeah. Just like
Michael Jackson. So he had,

682
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:49,961
he was just,

683
00:39:49,961 --> 00:39:53,980
the makeup was just to balance out the
real color of his skin because he's

684
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,500
really black. It's like, it's crazy,
but here's like total black there.

685
00:39:57,501 --> 00:40:01,060
Yet until he's wearing like black man, I
mean, it's ridiculous. And he's getting,

686
00:40:01,061 --> 00:40:05,790
he had an Afro Wig on, right? An
Afro Wig. Yeah. Yeah. Well, um,

687
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,350
the characters, like he curled
his hand. It wasn't a wig.

688
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:11,770
He's just curled his hair and he's
only wearing blue. You when you did it,

689
00:40:11,771 --> 00:40:13,140
did you curl your hair and

690
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,920
you have like a separate like
biography for the character?

691
00:40:17,921 --> 00:40:18,910
The character actually.

692
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:23,770
Oh did I have is since I got a
home movie of how he ended up,

693
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:27,790
he ended up with the makeup.
It's the whole store. I got dude,

694
00:40:27,791 --> 00:40:30,370
I got a story before he was even born.

695
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:34,330
His mother and his father like how
they got together and then had him.

696
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:35,343
He goes dude,

697
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:40,990
is that one of the reasons why you won't
say the word don't just the word Nigga.

698
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:45,250
You know what after I, I, I just came up
with that. I got really stoned one night,

699
00:40:45,251 --> 00:40:48,160
this is in 2000 I was
watching a Michael Jackson.

700
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:51,310
I was watching Barbara Walters
interview Michael Jackson,

701
00:40:51,311 --> 00:40:55,120
that famous interview and she, she asked
the hard questions. She said, Michael,

702
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,820
when you look, what do you see when
you're looking at me here? My uncle,

703
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:03,070
she asked him that and he goes,
Barbara, I don't look in the mirror.

704
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,530
And I was like Whoa.
And then he started in this interview,

705
00:41:06,531 --> 00:41:10,020
you explained that the reason he has
all the white makeup is cause he has a,

706
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:13,510
a logo is a, he has it all over
his face, which by the way,

707
00:41:13,511 --> 00:41:17,400
he very might well have
and, or have had, you know,

708
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:21,930
I in for people to not, I have it, he
could see them in narcos. Like I have my,

709
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:25,450
my knuckles like really white. You just
don't see it on much on me because,

710
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,910
cause I'm a white guy and he
was telling Barbara Walters did,

711
00:41:27,911 --> 00:41:29,110
it was all over his body.

712
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:33,860
And so the brown spots that remained here,

713
00:41:33,861 --> 00:41:37,860
he decided to like bleach those out
and then cover all this skin with you.

714
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:40,490
That's true. We'll do that. That
could all be true. But there's,

715
00:41:40,491 --> 00:41:41,930
but there's black people that have,

716
00:41:41,931 --> 00:41:44,870
but there's black people that have that
a logo and they're all white and they

717
00:41:44,871 --> 00:41:47,360
choose the brown makeup.
Can you chose the white makeup?

718
00:41:47,361 --> 00:41:51,620
He didn't have to choose why
anyways. Right. You know,
but if you look, if he did,

719
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:55,070
I think in his case,
if he's to be believed his,

720
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:57,410
he would've had to have
makeup all over his body.

721
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:01,790
Apparently he believes his whole body or
something. Yeah. Well, there's sprints.

722
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:06,490
There's some severe cases of it. There's
a lot of, it's stress. It's nutrient,

723
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:09,420
and that's one of the reasons, by the way,
my Videle lag. Oh, completely stopped.

724
00:42:09,421 --> 00:42:12,110
And once I started taking vitamins,
hardcore completely stopped.

725
00:42:12,111 --> 00:42:15,620
I believe it never spread. Who's more
stressed out than Michael Jackson? Yeah.

726
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:18,120
I almost went to jail from a lesson boys.
But anyway,

727
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:22,010
even if he does have a good excuse
for his face being all white,

728
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:24,290
you know what I mean?
Then you add all the other stuff.

729
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:28,340
The guy straightens his hair out.
He got nine nose jobs,

730
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,920
facial reconstruction to me,

731
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,920
nobody wanted to be white
more than Michael Jackson.

732
00:42:33,921 --> 00:42:36,340
He want her to be white more than anybody.

733
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,920
And he got away with it in increments
because everybody that is around them,

734
00:42:39,921 --> 00:42:42,080
no one's gonna. No one's
going to say, Michael,

735
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:45,170
what the fuck are you doing in your face?
They're out of the circle,

736
00:42:45,171 --> 00:42:47,690
they get cut out.
So He's surrounded by a bunch of guys.

737
00:42:47,691 --> 00:42:49,970
Like every time he did something
to his face or whatever,

738
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:52,360
people didn't even notice
it. It said, Ms Mr. Jackson,

739
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:54,170
your three o'clock cause here Mr. Jackson,

740
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:57,650
we've got some more boys in the backyard,
Mr. Jackson. You know what I mean?

741
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:00,770
They have a question him, they get cut
out. No one's sat him down and said,

742
00:43:00,771 --> 00:43:04,880
dude look at the fucking mirror.
You look like an alien.

743
00:43:04,881 --> 00:43:07,430
He kept just chopped. He
just kept going, kept going,

744
00:43:07,431 --> 00:43:10,250
kept building fucking carnival
rides and all that shit. So to me,

745
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,900
the character back to the character,

746
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:14,540
I was watching this Barbara
Walters special and I thought,

747
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:16,610
what if a guy did it in reverse?

748
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:21,700
What if there was a white guy that wanted
to be black so bad that he used the

749
00:43:22,371 --> 00:43:27,260
same excuse? Have you seen this video
of the tanning lady from New Jersey?

750
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:31,370
I saw a picture of her dude,
dude, you got to see the injury.

751
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,240
You haven't seen the interview. Nah,
you're not going to fucking believe this.

752
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:40,190
There is a lady who tan so much.
She's black, like Denzel Washington.

753
00:43:40,191 --> 00:43:43,010
Dude. Wow. She's a white
chick and she's black as fuck.

754
00:43:43,011 --> 00:43:46,530
It looks like a Saturday night
live parody. It totally does.

755
00:43:46,531 --> 00:43:48,960
So it doesn't even look real. Is there
anywhere I could? Where did I say?

756
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:51,980
I'm going to pull this up for you. Hold
on. I have to stand down. I'll pull it up.

757
00:43:51,981 --> 00:43:55,430
I'll pull it up a youtube.
I'll just think,

758
00:43:55,431 --> 00:43:57,200
let me see Tammy,

759
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:01,820
if you go on youtube,

760
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:05,910
Google or search for
[inaudible] this is still up.

761
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:10,500
It's still up there too. It's
still up there. Quad tooth. Um,

762
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,630
it's uh, please forgive me.
I did that like 12 years ago.

763
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:15,910
I didn't realize putting on black,

764
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:18,850
like putting on black makeup was
like considered like blackface.

765
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:20,600
Like I didn't know the
whole history of blackface.

766
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:25,610
I just created a character guy wanted to
be black so bad that he lied to people

767
00:44:25,611 --> 00:44:26,790
until people he had video blog.

768
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:30,810
But I didn't realize it was like
taboo to put black makeup on. Um, I,

769
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:33,860
I'm sorry to all my black brothers out
there and people get manager. Yeah.

770
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:36,300
There's some people that got mad at me,
man, there's some people that got mad.

771
00:44:36,301 --> 00:44:38,150
They thought it was racist.
A lot of people thought I was right.

772
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:41,280
The guy who put it up on Youtube,
he thought it was racist.

773
00:44:41,281 --> 00:44:43,050
He put it up to like ruin me.

774
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:48,000
I mean that video was on one
of my first DVDs or it's, yeah,

775
00:44:48,001 --> 00:44:50,550
it's on my first DVD or summer,
my second one.

776
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:54,660
But I actually didn't put it on Youtube.
A guy who hates me,

777
00:44:54,661 --> 00:44:57,480
who thinks I'm racist.
A white guy who uh,

778
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,940
who just took offense
to it for some summary.

779
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:06,690
This is real. She took her daughter
tanning apparently this crazy bitch.

780
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:11,670
But wait til they get to her.
Look at her. Jesus Christ.

781
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:13,740
Is that the scariest thing
you've ever seen in your life?

782
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:18,180
Does she think anything's wrong? I have
no idea. She talking about slowing down?

783
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:21,120
No.
Look at her and for folks who can see,

784
00:45:21,121 --> 00:45:23,970
you don't want to hear this woman's voice
or I would, I would plug in the audio,

785
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:26,970
but shit,
you don't want to hear this lady's voice.

786
00:45:26,971 --> 00:45:30,030
It will just depress the shit out of here.
And this person has a kid.

787
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,190
She took her kid into the fucking
tanning booths. Apparently.

788
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:35,950
That's why there they arrested her.
The rest of their, for having her, her,

789
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:40,290
her kid wants to get like mommy and
become, she looks like an aborigine.

790
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,180
She looks like she's out in the
middle of the woods, by the way.

791
00:45:42,181 --> 00:45:44,850
I think aborigines, you know, I'll
say that. Or is it asking them? Well,

792
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:47,890
one of those a new thing,
you're not allowed to say.
Someone said, you know, really,

793
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:52,380
you can't ask him. I'll ask him.
I was bad. It's uh, it's, uh,

794
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:55,530
if they're working with, if there
were more neighborhoods of Eskimos,

795
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:57,600
you know what I mean? Then we'd have
something to worry about. Are there,

796
00:45:57,601 --> 00:46:02,040
are you kidding me and Alaska Dude,
not an ally. Incredibly poor in Alaska.

797
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,220
There's Eskimo get ashore. Oh
yeah, for sure man. There's some,

798
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,420
the poorest people you would think
there'd be a, they just like Igloos.

799
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:14,040
How much does that come? I try to live
life. That's probably racist. Yeah.

800
00:46:14,041 --> 00:46:16,620
You can't say that. Well, I do the jokes.

801
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:20,670
I mean I make fun of Sarah Pailin and
told her to get back in the Igloo. I mean,

802
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:25,410
I can't see how that would be. I lose
or you know, for primitive people.

803
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,710
That's why, you know, they're,

804
00:46:26,770 --> 00:46:30,510
they're modern Inuits they're living
in 2012 they have the internet,

805
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:32,490
they're out there trying to get jobs,
you know,

806
00:46:32,491 --> 00:46:36,290
but a lot of them have the same problems
that American Indians do. You know,

807
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:41,040
new people came in and took over the land
that their families had been used for

808
00:46:41,041 --> 00:46:45,070
generations and generations is more
equipped for the fucking end then Eskimos

809
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:49,110
that she wasn't ready for it. How bad
I said then when you think about it,

810
00:46:49,111 --> 00:46:52,920
some people that survived in a place
where it was cold as fuck and they're just

811
00:46:52,921 --> 00:46:57,330
walking around walking around or Negroes
for real and they still make them.

812
00:46:57,390 --> 00:46:59,430
But they had to make now,
I mean,

813
00:46:59,431 --> 00:47:02,170
I'm sure somebody would if
there's bad ass pimp igloos right.

814
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:05,340
Got that live in caves, man.
I was watching this one thing.

815
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:08,400
It was a book that someone
read about a man who,

816
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:12,180
who got done with who he gave up on money.
Have you heard of this dude?

817
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:15,360
Apparently there's only intelligent guy.
Let me, let me Google this real quick,

818
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:18,810
but you know they showed this guy,
he's living in a fucking cave.

819
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:22,620
He gave up on money in like
2003 he just said, fuck this.

820
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:24,030
I don't want to deal with money anymore.

821
00:47:24,031 --> 00:47:28,140
I'm just going to live off dumpster
diving and eating fucking roadkill.

822
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:32,540
I would rather live in a fucking one
bedroom. Egl did a fucking cave. Dude.

823
00:47:32,541 --> 00:47:34,180
Are you kidding me?
Completely retarded.

824
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:38,980
But you stop and think about the snake
for the, came from land of the lost.

825
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:40,790
Remember? That's a good cave, right?

826
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:46,450
What are those animals that
were [inaudible]? It was
all lit up in there. Yeah.

827
00:47:46,451 --> 00:47:51,070
What were those things called? Clean
stacks. Yeah. I would live in that cave.

828
00:47:51,071 --> 00:47:54,880
That's it. You would look, that's
it. That's it. That's the only,

829
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:59,170
that's the best cave I've ever seen.
That show was so stupid.

830
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,210
I believed that.
Yeah.

831
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:04,840
This dude on survivalists.com apparently
he's an intelligent guy too. He just,

832
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,940
whatever,
for whatever fucking weird reason,

833
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:09,850
he just decided to just give
up or if that was a gimmick.

834
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:13,680
You know how he's famous now? He's
getting laid. It's a blogger. Just tell.

835
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:17,290
Just tell people you live in
case he blogs in the library,

836
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:22,090
but he completely gave up on
money. Yeah, he's a fucking idiot.

837
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:27,640
Look, money gets you soap and it's a
way that we exchange worth. Yeah, it's,

838
00:48:27,641 --> 00:48:29,530
it's not perfect.
There's some socks.

839
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:32,770
But what you told me you wouldn't
want to watch game of Thrones.

840
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,010
You don't want to watch that show you.
You're an asshole. What's wrong with you?

841
00:48:36,011 --> 00:48:39,760
It's fucking amazing. It's an incredible
work of art and it's on, you know,

842
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:44,650
HBO get a job so you could pay for
Hbo. You dumb. Fuck you cave dwelling,

843
00:48:44,651 --> 00:48:46,870
asshole. You're missing
out on so much. Cool Shit.

844
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:50,410
Have you ever had beats by Dr Dre
headphones on? Have you ever wore those?

845
00:48:50,411 --> 00:48:53,890
You'd dummy? No. Are those cool?
They're fucking amazing and yeah,

846
00:48:53,891 --> 00:48:56,650
they're great too. And they'd noise
cancel when you're on airplanes. Dude,

847
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,270
they got that noise canceling feature.

848
00:48:58,271 --> 00:49:01,210
So all you hear is the
sound you get taken away,

849
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:04,300
especially if you eat a pot cookie
before you get to the airport.

850
00:49:04,301 --> 00:49:06,460
And he timed it perfectly,
you know,

851
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:10,200
beats by Dr Dre and this asshole,
no money asshole.

852
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:11,380
He's never going to experience that.

853
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:16,770
If you've never experienced being way too
high in a plane listening to some Jimi

854
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:19,900
Hendrix while you got your eyes closed,
while you're really freaking out,

855
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:24,100
you feel yourself kind of freaking out
because you're way too high to just be

856
00:49:24,101 --> 00:49:25,690
hanging around a bunch
of people you don't know.

857
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:29,170
Laying down side by side
next to some total stranger,

858
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:32,650
there's some total stranger I could
reach over and touch them with my pinky,

859
00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:36,430
like I have to stay all cuddled up so
that I don't roll over and touch this

860
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:38,290
total stranger.
Maybe we don't know the whole story.

861
00:49:38,291 --> 00:49:41,920
Maybe like his wife fucked his son or
something and he's was like, fuck that.

862
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:47,250
You know, something horrible.
You know, maybe. Yeah, we,
there's gotta be some more,

863
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:49,780
more to it for you to give
up everything going to cave.

864
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:54,190
Your wife had her do some evil
shit. Maybe not. Maybe it's just,

865
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:58,510
it's a fucking dumb dude. You know?
Maybe he's just crazy. Who knows?

866
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:03,190
The world is filled with fucking
crackpots man is the world is filled with

867
00:50:03,191 --> 00:50:07,420
people that think they got it nailed and
they found some new righteous course,

868
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:12,550
you know? Or the guy might
genuinely like being alone outside.

869
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:13,930
Who knows?
You know,

870
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:17,530
maybe foraging for food is the only thing
that keeps him from being depressed.

871
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:19,960
I don't know,
man.

872
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:24,780
There's some people that feel like they
don't get enough out of living everyday

873
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:26,290
life the way everybody else lives it.

874
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:30,140
Maybe this guy has some weird sense of
danger because he's out there live in

875
00:50:30,141 --> 00:50:33,800
like with no roof over his head and
Kate use maybe that actually does give a

876
00:50:33,801 --> 00:50:38,150
little spark inside of him. I'm just
talking shit. Hey, what do you think?

877
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:42,620
What do you think about what
they're saying on the Internet?

878
00:50:42,621 --> 00:50:45,200
It could be totally bullshit,
but it seems like it's real.

879
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:49,310
It seems like all the
presidents are all related. Oh,

880
00:50:49,311 --> 00:50:52,760
I've seen those.
I mean it's not been proven to be a hoax.

881
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:57,620
I think we should go to snopes.com
right? Nope. If that's real.

882
00:50:58,070 --> 00:51:00,240
If because on,
on uh,

883
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:05,320
Obama on camera is talking about him
being related to Dick Cheney or or yes.

884
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:12,140
Yes. On camera. In an interview
they ask them about it.

885
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:15,410
Could you imagine if like that David Eick
dude was right and they're all really

886
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:20,220
reptilians. Could you imagine
if life really was like a,

887
00:51:20,221 --> 00:51:24,950
a comic book movie? You know, Obama
said on camera, he's on camera,

888
00:51:24,951 --> 00:51:26,150
he's like on some show and he goes,
yeah,

889
00:51:26,151 --> 00:51:30,020
that's more of like the Reptilian side
of my brain that would react like that.

890
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:31,520
He said some shit like that.

891
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:34,220
Then I'm sure David Eick is
fuck has heads explode them.

892
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:38,630
When you hear shit like that,
you know, it w it appears,

893
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:43,660
it appears there's so much evidence in
different TV shows and news reports on

894
00:51:43,731 --> 00:51:44,564
it.

895
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:49,660
News reports that George Bush is
related to fucking like kings.

896
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:53,350
There, there is a blood line,
there is a royal blood line,

897
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:57,560
and that all these guys that are
precedent, they're part of the, uh,

898
00:51:57,590 --> 00:52:01,880
the 13 royal bloodlines.
How crazy is that?

899
00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:03,980
It's pretty crazy.
What if it's true?

900
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:07,540
What if it's true that they're all related
and it's all like a royal family and

901
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:11,510
elections are just a
big fucking act easier.

902
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:14,330
It'd be amazing if they could
pull it off like that. You know,

903
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:17,720
it was funny how some people like
Brian Cowen, I love him to death,

904
00:52:17,721 --> 00:52:21,170
but he never believed in conspiracies.
Neb believes no conspiracies.

905
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:25,190
But when we were talking about
Osama bin Ladin one thing, uh, he,

906
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:29,600
he believed that there was a conspiracy
on the Pakistani side and that they had

907
00:52:29,601 --> 00:52:32,180
had Osama bin Ladin tucked away,

908
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:36,870
like near this big military
base. You know, for years
they haven't talked to him.

909
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:37,461
They knew about it,

910
00:52:37,461 --> 00:52:40,820
but they kept their mouth shut even
though there was like a $30 million bounty

911
00:52:40,821 --> 00:52:41,570
on his head.

912
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:45,440
I can't believe the Pakistanis that
there was a conspiracy on their side,

913
00:52:45,710 --> 00:52:50,360
but that there was no conspiracy on
the American side. Hilarious. His,

914
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:55,220
his, his, his vision of it has to
always be Fox News. I love the Guy,

915
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:59,390
don't get me wrong, but it's, it's a,
it's a fascinating thing how he, uh,

916
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:02,540
he has this sort of, I mean, it's great
to have a guy like that on your side.

917
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:04,840
I wonder,
I wonder if he'd been tower.

918
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,360
Do you know if he thinks tower seven
fell because of fires? Oh yeah, he does.

919
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:13,370
He thinks of her fires like that.
He goes by the Popular Science reports,

920
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:18,380
Hearst publications that uh, the debunked
everything, all the nine 11 things.

921
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:22,850
The real, the real thing about
nine 11. The first two towers.

922
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:26,790
Don't freak me out as far as like you,
how, how did that possibly happen?

923
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:31,530
We've never seen a full jet airliner slam
into a giant building like that before.

924
00:53:31,531 --> 00:53:34,560
We've never seen it. We've never
seen two of them happen side by side.

925
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:37,140
We'd never seen buildings that were
that tall before. Not only now.

926
00:53:37,141 --> 00:53:39,640
We never seen buildings that were
that tall and that were made in when,

927
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:41,160
what were they made in
the sixties or something?

928
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:43,140
When the fuck did they make
the world trade centers?

929
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:48,180
I have so long fucking time ago. Right,
so these gigantic hundred and 10 foot,

930
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:52,170
110 story when my Hubby,
how big are those fucking things?

931
00:53:52,650 --> 00:53:54,930
I mean they were incredibly Beatty.
Some stories or something.

932
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:57,330
Just think about how a hundreds years,

933
00:53:57,331 --> 00:54:00,480
a hundred more than a hundred more than
a hundred that just think about how many

934
00:54:00,481 --> 00:54:02,370
fucking stacks of metal,

935
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:05,490
something like that is and what
our content that is to clean up.

936
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:09,120
Imagine if that's the big conspiracy
that it was done because those fucking

937
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:13,710
things were falling apart
and the construction company
is to what it did it they

938
00:54:13,711 --> 00:54:17,310
flew the planes in because they just
didn't want to be responsible for what

939
00:54:17,311 --> 00:54:19,050
happened whenever they
just fell out on that.

940
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:22,920
Did the high wire from tower one tower
two he did a high walked around the,

941
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:26,040
I can't believe that. Is that what
the flying we'll lenders? No, no.

942
00:54:26,041 --> 00:54:30,810
It's called the something.
Dude.

943
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:35,430
I can't watch that shit. Dude did it
illegally. Oh my. He set it all up.

944
00:54:35,431 --> 00:54:38,810
No one was going to let that shit happen.
They secretly went on online.

945
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:41,940
They measured all the shit.
They fucking made it happen.

946
00:54:41,941 --> 00:54:44,550
How did they get the wire in
between the two times? It was,

947
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:48,150
it was a very complicated,
there was like five people involved.

948
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:51,960
Can you imagine that shit?
How crazy that guy and that guy,

949
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,420
tight rope across tower one to tower two.

950
00:54:54,421 --> 00:54:55,620
Then I got a hundred stores or something.

951
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:59,700
Alan saying as that guy
didn't did it and it worked.

952
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:03,420
I'm pinching my Dick together as you
say this, I'm like my legs. I'm like,

953
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:09,170
now I'm asking. Okay, so you said
basically we don't know. You know the,

954
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:13,290
the planes could easily
caused those skyscrapers,

955
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:16,410
but the crazy thing is most people,

956
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:20,070
most people don't know that there
was three towers that went down.

957
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:25,310
Three tower seven was
a 47 storey skyscraper.

958
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:30,860
That five different angles on camera
went down like a controlled demolition.

959
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:36,000
I mean, what does that mean? What
could that possibly mean? They control,

960
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:38,970
it takes weeks to set up a control demo.

961
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:44,120
1500 engineers and architects are all
banding together and they all say that

962
00:55:44,281 --> 00:55:47,010
there's, that was a controlled
demo. How is that possible?

963
00:55:47,011 --> 00:55:51,480
Why would you demo a skyscraper the
same day those towers went down?

964
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:52,740
It doesn't make any sense.

965
00:55:52,741 --> 00:55:55,470
There's a lot of unanswered questions
as some fishy ass shit going.

966
00:55:55,471 --> 00:55:58,260
Unfortunate that there is
so much fish. Yeah, Shit.

967
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:01,860
And it goes like when you look into
the whole Pentagon missile thing,

968
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:04,970
it's one of those things to me where
someone starts talking to me about,

969
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:06,930
there's a missile it depending on,
it wasn't a plane,

970
00:56:06,931 --> 00:56:09,330
it was a missile at the Pentagon.
Just my instincts,

971
00:56:09,331 --> 00:56:12,330
my automatic instincts are okay,
this guy's kind of a crackpot.

972
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:14,640
This guy's a little bit
crazy with the conspiracies.

973
00:56:14,641 --> 00:56:17,450
I don't know what the fuck
at the Pentagon, you don't
either. Second was a muscle.

974
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:20,550
They've never released any of the footage.
I saw the footage they release.

975
00:56:20,551 --> 00:56:23,040
It was only like a couple of frames.
I couldn't tell what the fuck it was.

976
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,130
It could, I don't know. Maybe

977
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:24,963
it was a plane.

978
00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:28,090
I don't know what it looks like when you
take a picture of a plane that's going

979
00:56:28,091 --> 00:56:29,890
500 miles an hour,
a foot off the ground.

980
00:56:29,891 --> 00:56:32,410
I don't know what the fuck
that looks like. I don't know.

981
00:56:32,710 --> 00:56:37,710
But when you find out that they really
did have the accounting offices right

982
00:56:37,841 --> 00:56:42,841
there and that they really were trying
to cover up some incredible missing

983
00:56:43,001 --> 00:56:45,820
money. What was, how much money was
it? Two point 3 trillion trillion.

984
00:56:45,821 --> 00:56:46,810
Two point 3 trillion.

985
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:51,250
It was just announced by Donald Rumsfeld
the day before that there was a problem

986
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:54,670
and the two point $3
trillion is essentially been
swindled and they were going

987
00:56:54,671 --> 00:56:55,810
to get to the bottom of it.
Well,

988
00:56:55,811 --> 00:57:00,130
the office where they're going to get to
the bottom of it gets hit by a fucking

989
00:57:00,131 --> 00:57:04,480
projectile that blows a hole through
the side of the building and into the

990
00:57:04,481 --> 00:57:08,410
courtyard. Kills all the accountants.
That's incredible. Isn't that crazy?

991
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,840
That is one of the greatest all time.

992
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:14,800
Like if you wanted to have
like a conspiracy where
there's actual evidence that

993
00:57:14,801 --> 00:57:18,430
makes you go, what the fuck does,
could it be? Could they be this crazy?

994
00:57:18,670 --> 00:57:21,910
Could it be this crazy? What happened
to that two point 3 trillion?

995
00:57:21,911 --> 00:57:24,820
It was it ever addressed again? Yeah.
And there's, you know, do you know,

996
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,370
or is that what happened to that
money and was it ever addressed them?

997
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:28,750
That'll have to do who's
going to address it?

998
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:32,690
But immediately I want to be when
you, when you, even if you, you know,

999
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:36,950
have an event like nine 11 after
the dust settles, you know,

1000
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:41,470
so to speak, no pun intended, you would
think that after a while people would go,

1001
00:57:41,471 --> 00:57:44,410
oh yeah, that two point 3
trillion. What's up with that?

1002
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:47,130
People know that some scary shit going on.
People know that,

1003
00:57:47,131 --> 00:57:50,620
that whoever pulled that shit off,
if you try to bust anybody out,

1004
00:57:50,621 --> 00:57:54,190
you're gonna die. You're
gonna die. So everyone just
keeps the fucking mouth shut.

1005
00:57:54,191 --> 00:57:56,720
They know is fishy, you
know? And then that,

1006
00:57:56,740 --> 00:58:00,700
the crazy thing is that you hear about
this Breitbart thing. What is that?

1007
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,050
They're an Andrew Breitbart.

1008
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:06,430
The Guy who died really recently is a
very controversial journalists character.

1009
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,960
He apparently had some video that he
was going to release about Barack Obama,

1010
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:14,020
and it was Barack Obama. And there
was some video that was released,

1011
00:58:14,021 --> 00:58:17,260
a Barack Obama giving like some sort
of a speech when he was younger,

1012
00:58:17,261 --> 00:58:20,830
when he was in college, I think when he
was at Harvard. And uh, just, you know,

1013
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:23,500
it wasn't really that radical
at all. You know, it's like,

1014
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:27,850
and but the word was that he was going
to release something that was going to be

1015
00:58:27,851 --> 00:58:31,630
damaging. Well, the fucking dude
ones up dying, right? No big deal.

1016
00:58:31,631 --> 00:58:33,140
He wasn't that healthy.
You'll look at him,

1017
00:58:33,170 --> 00:58:36,820
he's kind of big fat guy and he probably
had some bad Karma and you know,

1018
00:58:36,821 --> 00:58:40,390
there's a lot of wild shit going.
A dude's life is his ticker might've been,

1019
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:44,980
who knows? Right. So the guy dies, rest
in peace. Um, and then after he dies,

1020
00:58:44,981 --> 00:58:46,990
his fucking corn or dies by poisoning.

1021
00:58:47,950 --> 00:58:50,680
So after his corner says
that it's natural causes,

1022
00:58:51,010 --> 00:58:55,660
then the coroner dies by
poisoning and then you go, okay,

1023
00:58:55,661 --> 00:58:59,650
what? That's when he got
to go. What is it? I mean,

1024
00:58:59,651 --> 00:59:04,090
I don't want to believe that the
government or who the fucking scene or the

1025
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:09,220
Moussad or anybody decided to kill this
journalist and then they paid off his

1026
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:15,680
corner and then the coroner winds up
getting poisoned and killed or they,

1027
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:19,300
they threatened him or they use their
influence or whatever the fuck it was.

1028
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:22,130
But when you hear a story

1029
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:26,900
like that, God damn, it makes me go,
is anybody checking on this? Is it,

1030
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:30,880
Oh, who's looking into that?
That seems, that's a little,

1031
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:34,310
I would like to sit down with everybody
involved in that sort of a situation.

1032
00:59:34,311 --> 00:59:36,920
If I was, if I was the mayor
or the governor or whatever,

1033
00:59:36,921 --> 00:59:39,440
whoever the fuck would be the one who
would have jurisdiction over something

1034
00:59:39,441 --> 00:59:42,020
like that, I'd like to be the
guy who sits down. He goes,

1035
00:59:42,021 --> 00:59:46,070
what the fuck is going on here? Yeah.
And, and the Pentagon thing, they're like,

1036
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:51,810
if a plane of is like a seven 47,
a commercial airline hit that, uh,

1037
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,440
there've been lots of
planes that went down.

1038
00:59:54,470 --> 00:59:59,070
And what you find is a big giant
chunks of the Fuchsia Lodge and,

1039
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:04,130
and, and suitcases and seats and
tennis shoes in legs and body parts.

1040
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:07,880
That's what happens when a plane crashes.
There was none of that shit.

1041
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:11,240
And the only pictures that they show, like
the debunker side, they show pictures,

1042
01:00:11,241 --> 01:00:14,960
but like real tight shots
of like, uh, burned, uh,

1043
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:18,320
airplane tire and then they show next to
it. This is what it really looks like.

1044
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:21,620
It's the same room. Yeah. Where is that?
Where did you even take that picture?

1045
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:25,790
Give me a shot from,
from way back and show me all.

1046
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:28,910
Show me that it's the Pentagon.
Why you showing that? The evidence,

1047
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:31,850
our pictures up close.
You don't know where that is.

1048
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:36,600
A dark room and you're seeing like, oh,
here it says United and the only shot,

1049
01:00:36,601 --> 01:00:36,981
by the way,

1050
01:00:36,981 --> 01:00:41,120
it would be very easy if the government
wanted to release Photoshop images or

1051
01:00:41,121 --> 01:00:45,050
images of other pieces of wreckage and
claiming how many people really had

1052
01:00:45,051 --> 01:00:47,000
access to the Pentagon at that day.

1053
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:49,740
How many people were running around and
taking pictures along and I played it.

1054
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:51,470
That's incredibly restricted.

1055
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:54,770
So it's not like it was open season for
journalists to come and check everything

1056
01:00:54,771 --> 01:00:57,170
out with cameras.
So whatever photos they have,

1057
01:00:57,171 --> 01:00:58,490
who the fuck knows what really happened?

1058
01:00:58,491 --> 01:01:01,790
And then there's another photo where
it's like you see the lawn and there's a

1059
01:01:01,791 --> 01:01:05,260
little strip of like American
airlines like bitch, how eat,

1060
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:08,540
show me everything all in
one big shot of everything.

1061
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:12,530
Don't show me up close pay
Tony Metal of everything. Yeah,

1062
01:01:12,531 --> 01:01:17,000
a piece of metal up close. You are
you telling me that that's evidence?

1063
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:18,780
That's not evidence.
They,

1064
01:01:18,850 --> 01:01:22,910
they must have like had like really
detailed images of every single app.

1065
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:23,840
If that was an attack,

1066
01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:26,980
they would have detailed images of every
single aspect of that thing that they

1067
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,370
can know.
One of the main witnesses,

1068
01:01:28,371 --> 01:01:31,790
the chick that was the black chick
that was on Jesse Ventura show and they

1069
01:01:31,791 --> 01:01:34,880
didn't that she said there was no
plane. She walked over, she goes,

1070
01:01:34,881 --> 01:01:36,140
she thought it was the whole time.

1071
01:01:36,141 --> 01:01:40,680
It was a bomb because I was no evidence
of any wreckage or seats or luggage and

1072
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:44,180
binder. What kind of record you would
get though. You know, they have shown,

1073
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:48,290
they've taken fighter jets and they've
remote controlled flied them remote,

1074
01:01:48,291 --> 01:01:52,700
flew them into a gigantic blocks of,
of concrete.

1075
01:01:52,970 --> 01:01:56,750
They're like built this huge
wall of concrete and they
flew jets into it and the

1076
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:59,540
jets just incinerate.
It's really crazy. Like,

1077
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:03,000
but I think they're going like way
faster and they're way smaller. Yeah.

1078
01:02:03,770 --> 01:02:06,440
It's a different experience.
If you look at nine one, one,

1079
01:02:06,470 --> 01:02:08,910
like a detective with an open mind and,

1080
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:12,890
and you have to know what an open minded
first look at it like a detective would

1081
01:02:12,891 --> 01:02:17,300
like you're a c CSI. Look at all the
facts. Don't just say, oh, those,

1082
01:02:17,630 --> 01:02:20,130
those conspiracy kooks conspiracy nuts.
That's

1083
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:22,360
not what a detective, uh, you'd get fired

1084
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:25,660
right away by the way. You,
you've got to realize folks,

1085
01:02:25,690 --> 01:02:28,720
and this is absolutely 100% positive.

1086
01:02:29,110 --> 01:02:33,610
There are people that work
for the government that are
involved in what's called

1087
01:02:33,611 --> 01:02:36,910
disinformation.
And one of the things that they will do,

1088
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:39,880
and this is a very smart
tactic and very clever,

1089
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:45,160
they will mix truth with ridiculous
bullshit that automatically makes you look

1090
01:02:45,161 --> 01:02:48,230
like a Kook. So if, if you're, uh,

1091
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:52,150
if you're reading something and it sounds
really good and fascinating and then

1092
01:02:52,630 --> 01:02:55,420
completely ridiculous all at the
same time, like someone, they,

1093
01:02:55,421 --> 01:02:58,990
then they throw something about alien
bases on the moon and that they have,

1094
01:02:58,991 --> 01:03:02,050
you know, the transcripts of these
aliens communicating with people.

1095
01:03:02,051 --> 01:03:05,680
Like then you go, okay, listen to this
fucking crazy bitch. Like, oh man,

1096
01:03:05,681 --> 01:03:08,980
they ain't no aliens on a fucking
moon communicating with Ronald Reagan.

1097
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:10,660
You know, what do you, what do
you, what are you talking about?

1098
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:14,320
But they'll mix some
real truth about the CIA.

1099
01:03:14,321 --> 01:03:18,370
So real truth about the way things are
run and that way it diffuses all those

1100
01:03:18,371 --> 01:03:20,470
real truths in people's minds.

1101
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:24,490
You associate that shit with big foot
and psychics and it's just a bunch of

1102
01:03:24,491 --> 01:03:28,540
crazy silly thinking that is
a, as a, as a a full grown man,

1103
01:03:28,541 --> 01:03:32,140
I don't have time for, you know,
becomes one of those things. It's a,

1104
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:35,740
it's a really clever thing.
So when you hear a naughty story,

1105
01:03:35,741 --> 01:03:38,890
we hear someone who's saying something
completely ridiculous but also makes

1106
01:03:38,891 --> 01:03:39,760
sense at the same time,

1107
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:44,190
they're probably government
agents. Who knows, right?

1108
01:03:44,470 --> 01:03:48,480
If I've been accused of being a government
agent. That's amazing. That's awesome.

1109
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:49,380
That's how they would do it.

1110
01:03:49,410 --> 01:03:53,910
They would train me up through the ranks
of being a fucking comedian and then

1111
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:58,500
get me indicates fighting commentary
and then recruit me to save America from

1112
01:03:58,501 --> 01:03:59,490
the bad guys.

1113
01:03:59,770 --> 01:04:03,380
Can you imagine what kind of a government
agent, what I be telling everybody,

1114
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:07,670
go smoke some weed. Relax,
do Jujitsu. Don't be greedy.

1115
01:04:07,671 --> 01:04:11,030
Don't be a [inaudible]. Back
to the original question.
Like there's a question.

1116
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:13,700
Yeah. Why do you remember?
How do you fucking,

1117
01:04:13,830 --> 01:04:18,400
how do you feel about every president
being related and part of the bloodline?

1118
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:22,610
Um, if it is true, what
doing good stuff research.

1119
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:27,110
If you go to my youtube
page and go to my playlist,

1120
01:04:27,111 --> 01:04:30,320
I got the Illuminati playlist.
Go to the,

1121
01:04:30,350 --> 01:04:34,040
like the last one I added in the
last two. It's in deep shit, man.

1122
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:37,190
I mean there's the president's
actually telling you he's related.

1123
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:39,680
Like George Bush is related to,
uh,

1124
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:44,750
like a bunch of people in politics now
and like high and the guys like John

1125
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:45,500
Kerry and,

1126
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:50,500
and he's related to John Kerry
or the bullet cousins and shit.

1127
01:04:50,810 --> 01:04:55,280
Really? Yeah. Dude. I'm telling you. I'm
telling you man, unless it's all bullshit.

1128
01:04:55,370 --> 01:04:58,560
I mean it could be all bullshit. This
could be a total huge hope. Well,

1129
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:02,180
I'm going to uh,
behind the matrix.com

1130
01:05:04,090 --> 01:05:05,510
so let's see what they
have to say about it.

1131
01:05:05,630 --> 01:05:10,010
You got to see Obama saying it himself.
He's related to Dick Cheney. Dude.

1132
01:05:10,730 --> 01:05:11,810
How crazy is that?

1133
01:05:12,530 --> 01:05:16,310
They're talking about it on a show
that's not like some CGI shit with a

1134
01:05:16,311 --> 01:05:17,140
different Obama.

1135
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:21,340
Obama is saying he's related that Dick
Cheney and then it goes deeper than that.

1136
01:05:21,341 --> 01:05:23,530
George W.
Bush is related to like old,

1137
01:05:24,110 --> 01:05:26,920
like kings and czars and shit.

1138
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:30,760
Hmm. Wow. Okay.

1139
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:32,110
This is the,
yeah,

1140
01:05:32,111 --> 01:05:36,280
there were apparently 44 men who are
president of the USA are related.

1141
01:05:37,030 --> 01:05:39,790
How crazy is this really true?
That's what I'm,

1142
01:05:39,820 --> 01:05:40,900
that's what I want to know is this,

1143
01:05:40,930 --> 01:05:45,280
is this Bob bullshit yards of all 43
presidents being related and this is just

1144
01:05:45,281 --> 01:05:46,740
randomly happen or billions to me.

1145
01:05:48,170 --> 01:05:49,003
Huh?

1146
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:53,020
A billion to one is that, is
that the number? Didn't know.

1147
01:05:53,021 --> 01:05:56,200
The guy's saying billions. It's
just someone's editorial, I believe.

1148
01:05:57,180 --> 01:06:01,530
I don't know if he's right.
Oh, sources. Look Kaye, cnn.com

1149
01:06:03,330 --> 01:06:07,740
Google Illuminati bloodline or
youtube Illuminati bloodlines, dude.

1150
01:06:07,741 --> 01:06:10,800
And just like Herman Cain
related to people too,

1151
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:13,680
they're all related according to the shit.

1152
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:17,700
Most of the presidents are all related.
They're all part of the same blood line.

1153
01:06:17,701 --> 01:06:22,170
How fucking nutty is. That's
ridiculous. Ridiculous. Riley be true.

1154
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:26,300
If it's true, do we really are the
matrix dude, really? Our Vanilla,

1155
01:06:26,310 --> 01:06:29,070
Rowdy Roddy Piper will be totally right.

1156
01:06:29,490 --> 01:06:33,780
That movie them or day or whatever day
it was at. It was a fun movie, man.

1157
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:37,200
I haven't seen it, but one of my students,
Dave Callahan was telling me about it.

1158
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:41,100
He said, I need to watch it.
Wow, this is so ridiculous.

1159
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:44,370
Are you finding out more information?
It's just, it's ridiculous.

1160
01:06:44,610 --> 01:06:46,800
It's just hard to believe.
Exactly.

1161
01:06:46,890 --> 01:06:51,600
But when you see Obama Search Obama,
Dick Cheney,

1162
01:06:52,410 --> 01:06:52,780
okay.

1163
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:57,550
Video, uh, blood, uh, cousins,
Obama, cousin Dick Cheney.

1164
01:06:58,210 --> 01:07:01,960
And then you'll see them talking about it.
This is what their dos,

1165
01:07:04,610 --> 01:07:06,110
this is really weird,
man.

1166
01:07:07,950 --> 01:07:08,783
Yeah.

1167
01:07:09,050 --> 01:07:13,910
The uh, yeah. Uh, what's all right, I
just, and he's coming over to take a look.

1168
01:07:13,940 --> 01:07:15,950
It's just the different
websites or point to that.

1169
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:19,940
I still honestly can't say that. I
don't, I, I don't really know. It's true.

1170
01:07:20,270 --> 01:07:23,780
I don't think you should be, uh, just
reading something online and spouting off.

1171
01:07:23,781 --> 01:07:26,660
That's true of doing that too many times
in the past and been completely wrong.

1172
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:28,910
No, no, no. I know. I know. That's
why I'm going to, I'm going to say,

1173
01:07:28,911 --> 01:07:33,560
I'm going to send you a link Rabia
theory. Why don't you ask Siri? Siri says,

1174
01:07:33,950 --> 01:07:36,280
Siri. Yeah. That's, you don't
want to share. See if it,

1175
01:07:36,290 --> 01:07:38,420
we'll see what that bitch knows.
Put her, put her at ease. Right now.

1176
01:07:38,540 --> 01:07:43,260
I'm going to find the video. I'm going
to call Siri. Okay, here it is. Um,

1177
01:07:44,270 --> 01:07:45,950
uh,
I'm going to send you the link.

1178
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:49,880
I could send it to you and you'll be
able to play it. Yeah. Okay. What is it?

1179
01:07:49,910 --> 01:07:53,180
Wait a minute. You'll send it
to me. How a t email. No, no,

1180
01:07:53,181 --> 01:07:55,310
I don't have that set up like that.
What do you want me to play?

1181
01:07:55,610 --> 01:07:56,840
Just the beginning of,

1182
01:07:56,870 --> 01:08:00,350
I want you to hear Obama talking about
how he's cousins with Dick Cheney. Oh,

1183
01:08:00,351 --> 01:08:04,600
I don't even want to hear that little.
Now he's sick. He says it. I believe it.

1184
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:07,910
He's so, he's some somehow
or another, some distant
cousin with Dick Cheney. Yeah.

1185
01:08:07,911 --> 01:08:09,990
But then it gets deeper.
It's almost like someone, uh,

1186
01:08:10,010 --> 01:08:12,710
someone dug that out and he asked to
talk about, and he has to admit it,

1187
01:08:12,770 --> 01:08:15,980
but it goes deeper than all.
Relate it up. That's what

1188
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:19,790
it's saying, dude. Everybody's related.
Like George Bush is related to Obama.

1189
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:24,680
They're all part of the royal blood line
that goes back to ancient Sumeria. Wow.

1190
01:08:25,110 --> 01:08:28,840
Yes. Yes. This is a word doc.

1191
01:08:28,860 --> 01:08:33,020
Elliptic shaped the rulers. It's just like
a Hollywood club, right? The promoters,

1192
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:37,190
when they're, when they're new club dies,
just like the ancient scenario died.

1193
01:08:37,490 --> 01:08:39,110
When they're new.
They're eighth cousins.

1194
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:43,310
Obama and Dick Cheney or eighth cousins.
Yeah,

1195
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:47,270
and look at type in George W.
Bush cousins press.

1196
01:08:47,271 --> 01:08:50,420
Did you hear what Obama said when they
will, they gave them the revelation.

1197
01:08:50,421 --> 01:08:55,250
He goes, every family has a
black sheep. Boom son, suck it.

1198
01:08:55,430 --> 01:08:59,240
He's fun. He's for sure the most
gangster president of all time.

1199
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:03,050
He said some gangster shit like Matt
Damon said that he was disappointed in him

1200
01:09:03,290 --> 01:09:04,550
and then you know,
he does those uh,

1201
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:09,080
president's a press speeches where he does
essentially does stand up and he goes,

1202
01:09:09,260 --> 01:09:11,930
hey man,
I saw you last movie right back at Ya.

1203
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:16,340
Like the president said, your last
movie sucked dude. And you know,

1204
01:09:16,341 --> 01:09:21,260
it's even crazy crazy is that Brad Pitt
and Angelina Jolie are all in the mix

1205
01:09:21,261 --> 01:09:25,310
too. They're all related
to the presidents. What did
you see Jimmy Kimmel doing?

1206
01:09:25,410 --> 01:09:29,930
A White House speech or doing standup
at the White House and or wherever the

1207
01:09:29,931 --> 01:09:33,140
fuck it was. Some mean nuking which is in
the audience. Obama was in the audience,

1208
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:35,420
whatever the fuck official
name of the gathering was.

1209
01:09:35,570 --> 01:09:38,570
He started talking about marijuana
legalization. And then it's real.

1210
01:09:38,571 --> 01:09:41,150
People care about weed laws.
It's true.

1211
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:45,050
And that's who said that Jimmy Kimmel.
Oh yeah, I heard about that. Yeah.

1212
01:09:45,051 --> 01:09:49,340
Jimmy Kimmel is, it was, you know, it
was a really fascinating moment, man.

1213
01:09:49,370 --> 01:09:52,490
He's a brave motherfucker for doing that.
It would end any was,

1214
01:09:52,550 --> 01:09:54,410
and he's got damn right. You know, and he,

1215
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:57,920
he did what you're supposed to do if you
get an opportunity to do something like

1216
01:09:57,921 --> 01:10:01,820
that where it's going to be on
television. He was respectful, you know,

1217
01:10:01,850 --> 01:10:03,230
but he was still funny,
you know,

1218
01:10:03,231 --> 01:10:06,020
when he was doing a standup and then
when he had a point about marijuana,

1219
01:10:06,021 --> 01:10:09,530
he just, he sits, made the point man
that real people care about these laws.

1220
01:10:09,890 --> 01:10:13,850
And he didn't go crazy with it and didn't
go too far with it, but he was, he was,

1221
01:10:13,851 --> 01:10:16,550
you know, it's fucking true.
It took roast crazies that,

1222
01:10:16,551 --> 01:10:20,420
that marijuana was a conspiracy.
It's still is.

1223
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:25,040
It's still fucking is the most amazing
thing in the 2012 there's people out

1224
01:10:25,041 --> 01:10:28,790
there that will list all sorts of negative
effects that can have. Listen, folks,

1225
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:32,510
fucking everything you do can have a
negative effect. If you get crazy with it.

1226
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:36,620
We're drinking coffee here. Coffee
can fucking kill you if you're crazy.

1227
01:10:36,621 --> 01:10:39,230
And you one of those dudes who just wants
to drink coffee all day and just get

1228
01:10:39,231 --> 01:10:41,660
gacked out of your mind
on Venti Starbucks,

1229
01:10:41,810 --> 01:10:43,970
you could have a fucking heart attack.
You could like,

1230
01:10:43,971 --> 01:10:47,690
you could stimulate yourself to death.
People die from caffeine overdose.

1231
01:10:47,691 --> 01:10:51,800
That's a, that's an actual, you
know, fairly regular occurrence.

1232
01:10:51,950 --> 01:10:55,400
I think there's something like 10,000
people die every year from aspirin and

1233
01:10:55,401 --> 01:10:59,420
caffeine together combined. Something
along those lines. Either way.

1234
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:00,690
Point is it's,

1235
01:11:00,730 --> 01:11:05,630
it's the best site ever of a corrupt
government that this magical plants,

1236
01:11:05,810 --> 01:11:09,080
you know, and people's own full can
pull it. Heard you fucking queer.

1237
01:11:09,290 --> 01:11:11,580
We're all your magic.
What do you want your weed,

1238
01:11:11,581 --> 01:11:15,990
you fork can baby kids vibe without weed.
Those people need weed.

1239
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:20,460
First of all. I'm more than
anybody, right? Yeah, definitely.
And, and second of all,

1240
01:11:20,461 --> 01:11:23,340
it's,
he don't understand what this really is.

1241
01:11:23,490 --> 01:11:28,490
This is a potential life enhancing
substance that is just naturally growing

1242
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:30,030
around people.

1243
01:11:30,150 --> 01:11:35,010
And it's been with us for thousands of
years and we have some sort of a physical

1244
01:11:35,011 --> 01:11:36,690
symbionic relationship.

1245
01:11:37,350 --> 01:11:42,350
We actually have cannabinoid receptors
in our brain that receive cannabinoids

1246
01:11:42,811 --> 01:11:47,220
both from cannabis and from exercise.
Your experience could have annoyance.

1247
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:51,990
That's a confusing. People
don't believe that humans,

1248
01:11:51,991 --> 01:11:56,070
and not by the way, by the way, there's
the benefits aren't even psychoactive.

1249
01:11:56,071 --> 01:11:59,490
One of the best ways to use
marijuana is to actually eat it,

1250
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:02,850
to eat the fresh leaves, the
eat, the leaves and the plants.

1251
01:12:02,851 --> 01:12:04,800
It's incredibly healthy for you.

1252
01:12:05,010 --> 01:12:08,580
It has zero psychoactive effect
cause it's not the only one.

1253
01:12:08,581 --> 01:12:12,270
You have to smoke it or your staff to
cook it into an edible form and then eat

1254
01:12:12,271 --> 01:12:16,200
it. But to just eat marijuana. It
doesn't give you the psychedelic effects.

1255
01:12:16,201 --> 01:12:20,280
But what it does do,
it's a really incredibly healthy plant.

1256
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:24,960
It has a fuck load of amino acids,
it contains a lot of protein.

1257
01:12:24,961 --> 01:12:28,020
Hemp seeds are really good for
it and they fucking tastes good.

1258
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:31,800
Like I like eat hemp seeds all the time,
like I'll eat them as snacks.

1259
01:12:31,801 --> 01:12:34,740
I'll be sitting there watching TV and
I'll have like hemp seed and it's,

1260
01:12:35,110 --> 01:12:37,170
it's incredible amounts of protein.

1261
01:12:37,290 --> 01:12:41,100
It's really healthy and
clean and it's illegal.

1262
01:12:41,130 --> 01:12:42,390
It makes the best paper,

1263
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:45,080
makes the best clothes you could
make fucking plywood out of it.

1264
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:49,290
It's virtually indestructible. It's
amazing. It's lighter than wood. It's,

1265
01:12:49,291 --> 01:12:53,250
it grows quicker than would, it's
stronger than wood. It's, it's an amazing,

1266
01:12:53,370 --> 01:12:56,610
almost an alien being.
It's almost like something there's,

1267
01:12:56,700 --> 01:13:01,700
it's not like it's one of the most
useful plants on earth of aside from the

1268
01:13:03,031 --> 01:13:06,330
psychoactive effects of it,
when you add the psychoactive effects,

1269
01:13:06,331 --> 01:13:09,720
it's the number one use multiuse
full plant on earth most for sure,

1270
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:13,290
because it actually can change people's
lives and make people feel better.

1271
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:17,490
It actually gives you a good feeling
like the everybody needs that.

1272
01:13:17,550 --> 01:13:19,890
That's like one of the most
important things we could ever have.

1273
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:24,030
Something in our life that gives us a
good feeling something or alive that makes

1274
01:13:24,031 --> 01:13:27,390
us a little more humble. Something in our
life that makes us a little more aware,

1275
01:13:27,510 --> 01:13:30,840
something in your life that makes you
a little more appreciative, you know,

1276
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:33,090
these poor fucks.
Horrified.

1277
01:13:33,091 --> 01:13:36,390
Did she feel bad for people that
don't want people to smoke weed? Um,

1278
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:40,650
I understand. You know, I was,
I wasn't into it until I was 28,

1279
01:13:40,651 --> 01:13:43,470
so I totally understand where they're
coming from. I just, you know,

1280
01:13:43,471 --> 01:13:46,460
I don't want to push anybody
into it or anything, but if, uh,

1281
01:13:46,710 --> 01:13:50,670
I'm just going to keep doing what I'm
doing and, and let people know that,

1282
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:54,030
you know, most of the important
stuff that I do, almost all of it,

1283
01:13:54,031 --> 01:13:58,250
the important stuff I do,
I'm medicated with, uh,

1284
01:13:58,380 --> 01:13:59,220
the sacred plant.

1285
01:13:59,460 --> 01:14:03,990
I feel if I taught a class
and I wasn't medicated,

1286
01:14:04,290 --> 01:14:07,200
that I would be cheating out my students.
I'm way more passionate.

1287
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:09,570
I'm way more passionate when I teach,

1288
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:14,590
when I'm still in way like doing comedy
and you don't have a little weed in you.

1289
01:14:14,710 --> 01:14:16,450
You feel like you're,
you're, you're not giving,

1290
01:14:16,451 --> 01:14:19,360
you feel like you're at
85 almost sometimes. No.

1291
01:14:19,630 --> 01:14:21,730
I like doing sober shows too,

1292
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:26,680
but I smoked so much weed and my
Mri ever really sober, you know,

1293
01:14:26,681 --> 01:14:30,640
because it's adjusted the way I act.
Even when I'm sober like playing music,

1294
01:14:30,641 --> 01:14:32,890
not stoned.
I couldn't even imagine that.

1295
01:14:33,690 --> 01:14:37,450
And it's when I get in my car
and I got like uh, uh, um,
when I'm, when I'm getting,

1296
01:14:37,510 --> 01:14:42,010
when I get in my car I just freshly
baked on my way to Jujitsu. Man.

1297
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:44,200
That's when I'm on fire.

1298
01:14:44,590 --> 01:14:49,590
That's when like all my
important decisions and ideas
come together on my way to

1299
01:14:49,811 --> 01:14:53,470
Jujitsu cause I'm so happy that I'm going
to show up to a place with a bunch of

1300
01:14:53,471 --> 01:14:57,180
my boys there and we're going to practice
strangling each other and whatever

1301
01:14:57,210 --> 01:15:02,210
music I got to hear music loud is
how on the way that you to loud man,

1302
01:15:03,670 --> 01:15:04,540

1303
01:15:04,570 --> 01:15:08,620

like a new album I just bought. Um,

1304
01:15:08,890 --> 01:15:12,820

Bassnectar up my ass man.

1305
01:15:12,910 --> 01:15:16,380
That motherfucker is on
fire. Holy Shit. Yeah,

1306
01:15:16,390 --> 01:15:19,780
we're supposed to do a podcast
with him. Yeah. End of May.

1307
01:15:19,781 --> 01:15:23,740
Like a memorial day weekend.
He either said Monday,

1308
01:15:23,741 --> 01:15:27,530
he's free or that Friday. And so it's up
to you Friday or Monday. So he's down.

1309
01:15:27,730 --> 01:15:30,700
He loves you, he loves you. He
just wants to hang out and talk.

1310
01:15:30,701 --> 01:15:34,690
I want to hang out and talk to him. He
said, let's just have a conversation.

1311
01:15:34,691 --> 01:15:36,160
We don't have to record
this. I'm like, oh man.

1312
01:15:36,340 --> 01:15:39,790
So don't deprive people of this cool
conversation that's going to be fun.

1313
01:15:39,970 --> 01:15:43,780
He's a fascinating guy. So looking forward
to it. It's, I am too, man. Incredible.

1314
01:15:43,781 --> 01:15:46,480
That's why I keep emailing you and
going, dude. He's like asking like, dude,

1315
01:15:46,481 --> 01:15:48,070
is this going to happen?
Is this going to happen to,

1316
01:15:48,071 --> 01:15:52,660
I can't tell you how weird that is for
me. You know, it's, it's weird, you know,

1317
01:15:53,220 --> 01:15:57,030
that, uh, when I kinda got celebrities
want to come on the podcast, I mean it's,

1318
01:15:57,031 --> 01:16:01,480
it's, it's a weird thing that people are
trying to do it, but it's amazing though.

1319
01:16:01,810 --> 01:16:05,410
I couldn't be happier, man.
This is the most like fulfilled,

1320
01:16:05,590 --> 01:16:10,450
like as far as like, uh, like
what I'm putting out. Yeah.

1321
01:16:10,630 --> 01:16:14,140
Like the most fulfilled I've
ever felt. Yeah. People. I mean,

1322
01:16:15,310 --> 01:16:18,130
like he, he just wants, he doesn't want
to talk about music. He's like, dude,

1323
01:16:18,131 --> 01:16:19,270
I just want to get on that.

1324
01:16:19,330 --> 01:16:22,180
Just talking about the unit might want
to talk about music too, you know,

1325
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:26,850
whatever. You know, I, I love when
people say that like, you know, um,

1326
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:30,610
I'm going to get a Mac dancing on the
podcast. I really like Mac. Dan's like,

1327
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:34,060
I've been meaning to contact him so he'll
hear about this or reach out to him.

1328
01:16:34,060 --> 01:16:38,700
He's a fascinating dude to me. Really
interesting guy. He's a Vegan and he's a,

1329
01:16:38,710 --> 01:16:41,230
and he does it for, for,
because of the animal rights,

1330
01:16:41,231 --> 01:16:45,640
like the way he feels about pets and
animals and factory farming and, but, um,

1331
01:16:45,850 --> 01:16:48,550
what's interesting is he's going to
talk about anything, but I'm amazed

1332
01:16:50,580 --> 01:16:55,030
was like, oh dude, can you
imagine how these UFC fighters,

1333
01:16:55,031 --> 01:17:00,031
they must be so sick and tired of talking
about fucking fights and especially

1334
01:17:00,821 --> 01:17:04,510
after training twice a fucking
day, six days a week. Yeah.

1335
01:17:04,550 --> 01:17:08,590
And I just want to say this to
all my 10 planet heads. Uh, I,

1336
01:17:09,650 --> 01:17:10,220
for every

1337
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:12,650
interview I do where I'm
just repeating myself,

1338
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:15,650
I know like my hardcore fans are like,
oh,

1339
01:17:15,710 --> 01:17:19,580
he's going to use that analogy
again. Oh, that fucking story again.

1340
01:17:19,790 --> 01:17:23,000
You know what I mean? Uh, I just
answered the questions they give to me.

1341
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:26,360
I know I could be repetitive,
I apologize.

1342
01:17:26,361 --> 01:17:29,210
But you got to understand there's
always new guys just getting into it,

1343
01:17:29,510 --> 01:17:32,680
getting into 10 plan and I got to go
back and give the history again. I'd,

1344
01:17:32,870 --> 01:17:35,600
I'd that'll talk about the
music. You know, that, you know,

1345
01:17:35,930 --> 01:17:38,060
there's a lot of people out there.
I'll, here he goes with the music again.

1346
01:17:38,061 --> 01:17:41,870
I'm sorry,
but I'm gonna talk about the music.

1347
01:17:43,490 --> 01:17:47,770
No, it's just, I just want to
let people know that because the,

1348
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:50,280
if I overheard someone saying,
dude,

1349
01:17:50,281 --> 01:17:53,480
that guy fucking just says
the same shit over and over,

1350
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:56,410
that wouldn't make me feel good. You
know what I mean? But it's, it's,

1351
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:58,750
it's part of the whole thing.
If you're going to,

1352
01:17:58,751 --> 01:18:01,400
you've got to realize that every time
you talk it's probably going to be the

1353
01:18:01,401 --> 01:18:03,470
first time a fuck load of people hear you.

1354
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:06,950
And if there's an important
thing that you have to get out,

1355
01:18:06,951 --> 01:18:10,610
an important part of your philosophy and
important part of how you got to where

1356
01:18:10,611 --> 01:18:12,910
you have to say it. Yeah,
unfortunately. Yeah.

1357
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:17,450
Until you become like Marilyn Manson to
become like super dope. Yeah, totally.

1358
01:18:17,510 --> 01:18:21,050
Totally. But I'm always gonna. I'm
always gonna pump the music man. Always.

1359
01:18:21,051 --> 01:18:25,310
I got to smoke shop and shirt on a smoke
Sherpa servants plan this Saturday for

1360
01:18:25,311 --> 01:18:28,070
my birthday. I'm like, yeah, where
is that? It moved, right? Yeah.

1361
01:18:28,071 --> 01:18:32,330
Move to dim mak studios, man. It's a
way better place is way better place.

1362
01:18:32,331 --> 01:18:36,740
It's in Hollywood.
I'm on 1643 cosmo.

1363
01:18:36,980 --> 01:18:40,970
It's a half a block south of Hollywood
boulevard. It's an awesome place.

1364
01:18:40,971 --> 01:18:45,730
Dj Aoki, that's his place. It's
called Denmark's name is Dj. Okay.

1365
01:18:45,770 --> 01:18:50,000
Yeah, like Shinya. Yup.
She's huge. Really famous Dj.

1366
01:18:50,330 --> 01:18:52,880
Huge. I mean a million
followers, that kind of shirts.

1367
01:18:53,660 --> 01:18:56,600
They become famous without
me even knowing they exist.

1368
01:18:56,660 --> 01:19:01,250
And then I find them when they have
like a 400 million youtube views,

1369
01:19:01,540 --> 01:19:04,790
like I'll go and look and look at one of
their videos on youtube, but I'm like,

1370
01:19:04,791 --> 01:19:09,200
what this get this has 100 million views.
What the fuck?

1371
01:19:09,201 --> 01:19:12,650
How did I miss this? Whizzed right
behind me. Yeah. He's huge man.

1372
01:19:12,651 --> 01:19:16,960
He owns that place. Um, uh, it's, it's
going to be my birthday celebration.

1373
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,310
My birthday is actually May 15th,
but that's on a Tuesday.

1374
01:19:19,311 --> 01:19:21,380
Can't have a party on a Tuesday.
So it,

1375
01:19:21,381 --> 01:19:24,080
me and my girlfriend actually
have our birthdays two days apart.

1376
01:19:24,081 --> 01:19:28,730
We're going to celebrate it. Dual thing

Everyone's welcome. No cover.

1378
01:19:31,150 --> 01:19:34,490
You said the two craziest things you
could ever say on the end. Everything's,

1379
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:38,810
everybody's welcome and we'll cover.
No, I want it to be packed. It's just,

1380
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,840
it's going to be packed. I want it
to be packed. We go on at 10 o'clock.

1381
01:19:41,841 --> 01:19:46,310
So get the early. Um, a three is,
you're going to get a crazy crowd, dude.

1382
01:19:46,550 --> 01:19:49,910
I hope so. And if you don't
know what my band sounds like,

1383
01:19:49,911 --> 01:19:54,770
you can go on iTunes and just iTunes smoke
serpent. I got two songs up on iTunes.

1384
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:59,000
A Jujitsu is one song and
dropped as another song. Judo,

1385
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:02,570
there's a video for a Jujitsu as well.
You could find that on youtube. Uh,

1386
01:20:02,571 --> 01:20:06,030
smoke serpent this Saturday.
My birthday, everyone's well,

1387
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:08,410
we could add that Bj,
Jay,

1388
01:20:08,420 --> 01:20:12,030
Jay Expo is this Saturday a day.

1389
01:20:12,150 --> 01:20:15,360
That's when Nick Diaz and Braulio
steamer go at it. Um, they,

1390
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:19,740
you could go watch that and just remember
the after party is at Dimock studios

1391
01:20:19,741 --> 01:20:21,720
on Saturday. The show.
It's going to be crazy.

1392
01:20:22,260 --> 01:20:25,110
You're going to have a bunch of
people with cats on their tee shirts.

1393
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:30,610
Catt squad cat. Beautiful. Beautiful. Um,

1394
01:20:31,110 --> 01:20:34,950
also my wrapper, well one of my
rappers is, his name is Capella.

1395
01:20:34,980 --> 01:20:38,370
His name is Eric Cruz. He, uh,
he's uh, he's one of my brown belt.

1396
01:20:38,371 --> 01:20:43,350
He's awesome and he's an amazing rapper
and he's really good at Jujitsu too,

1397
01:20:43,410 --> 01:20:46,440
cause he's, he's one of my best
friends. I love them to death, man.

1398
01:20:46,710 --> 01:20:50,670
He actually fights MMA too.
He's fighting May 20th.

1399
01:20:50,671 --> 01:20:51,780
It's on a Sunday.

1400
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:56,760
May 20th at the Nokia Center
is a third, uh, amateur fight.

1401
01:20:57,030 --> 01:21:01,320
He's undefeated as an amateur. Um,
there's a show called University of Nma.

1402
01:21:01,350 --> 01:21:03,900
It's just a bad ass amateur card,

1403
01:21:04,050 --> 01:21:06,690
like three or four 10th planet fighters
are fighting and he's one of them.

1404
01:21:06,691 --> 01:21:09,480
His name was Eric Eric Cruz.
He wraps or smoke serpent,

1405
01:21:09,540 --> 01:21:13,030
May 20th Nokia Center.
Um,

1406
01:21:13,430 --> 01:21:16,790
it's on a Sunday so you don't have to
worry about missing Strikeforce like

1407
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:21,330
Strikeforce as the day before. And it's
the debut also on that amateur show.

1408
01:21:21,330 --> 01:21:24,000
The first three fights are
going to be combat Jujitsu.

1409
01:21:24,180 --> 01:21:26,520
It's a sport that I
started with Turi Alta via,

1410
01:21:26,790 --> 01:21:31,110
he runs university of MMA combat Jujitsu.
It's a brand new sport.

1411
01:21:31,380 --> 01:21:34,800
It's going to take people really kind of
scared to do it there that really don't

1412
01:21:34,801 --> 01:21:38,880
know what to think of it.
But really combat Jujitsu
is, it's right in the middle.

1413
01:21:38,881 --> 01:21:42,240
It's in between MMA and, and just
straight grappling. It's in between.

1414
01:21:42,241 --> 01:21:45,600
That was a big hole.
It's Jujitsu with punches on the ground.

1415
01:21:45,601 --> 01:21:47,550
When you're standing it's just wrestling.

1416
01:21:47,850 --> 01:21:51,860
But as soon as one person is on the
ground, you can start punching. So it's,

1417
01:21:51,930 --> 01:21:53,690
you can either look at it as,
you know,

1418
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:57,230
if you're looking at it from the MMA
world, it's pussy MMA. Like, well I can,

1419
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:59,460
they're,
they're too scared to strike standing.

1420
01:21:59,610 --> 01:22:02,910
You could look at it as Super Tane MMA,
but if you're coming from the,

1421
01:22:03,150 --> 01:22:06,210
the Jujitsu side,
it's extreme Jujitsu.

1422
01:22:06,210 --> 01:22:09,840
Imagine watching Abu Dhabi and
they allowed punches on the ground.

1423
01:22:09,870 --> 01:22:12,860
How brutal and exciting that
would be. You know, it's,

1424
01:22:12,861 --> 01:22:15,630
it's all your perspective
and, um, it's gonna, you know,

1425
01:22:15,631 --> 01:22:20,340
since we're piggy backing on the
University of MMA show, you know,

1426
01:22:20,341 --> 01:22:22,620
it's the first three fights.
We're opening up the show.

1427
01:22:22,621 --> 01:22:25,590
We're just getting into it.
Just, we just got it sanctioned.

1428
01:22:25,591 --> 01:22:28,920
We're just starting it. We're
just testing it out. Ultimately,

1429
01:22:29,070 --> 01:22:32,820
combat Jujitsu doesn't look good
in a cage. It doesn't, it actually,

1430
01:22:32,821 --> 01:22:35,760
it looks better like professional
submission league, Rico chip rallies,

1431
01:22:35,770 --> 01:22:38,840
old Dutch show. Then that Hixon
Gracie tournament. We're just,

1432
01:22:38,970 --> 01:22:42,660
it's like blood sport. Just a flat mat.
Just like Abu Dhabi, a big flat matte.

1433
01:22:42,870 --> 01:22:45,090
That's where combat
Jujitsu is going to shine.

1434
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,760
It's going to take a while to become
available. The elbow each other.

1435
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:52,230
No elbows or the body. There's basically
amateur MMA rules on the ground.

1436
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:54,710
You could punch to the face,
no elbows to the face.

1437
01:22:54,750 --> 01:22:57,150
Wish they would find a way to pad elbows.

1438
01:22:57,720 --> 01:23:01,380
You know the real problem with elbows
and my opinion is not them as a blow.

1439
01:23:01,381 --> 01:23:05,060
I like elbows there, bad ass, but then
you know, tell that to Paul Horace.

1440
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:06,430
Then you'd have to like,
but

1441
01:23:06,430 --> 01:23:09,610
you'd have to pad shins too. It's
really kind of, then it becomes silly,

1442
01:23:09,940 --> 01:23:13,000
but what I keep thinking is
that elbows are so pointy.

1443
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:15,040
They're so good at cutting people open.

1444
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:19,750
How about fucking Alan Belcher's
wicked elbows. Now Boucher is

1445
01:23:21,850 --> 01:23:25,330
if you didn't see that fight. Sorry,
spoiler alert. Shut this off real quick.

1446
01:23:25,331 --> 01:23:27,280
If you DVR this and you
haven't seen it yet,

1447
01:23:27,310 --> 01:23:32,050
you got three seconds to one's
Monday. Fuck them. Fuck them dude.

1448
01:23:32,051 --> 01:23:35,620
It's on Fox. Watch that Shit
did Alan Belcher. He went,

1449
01:23:35,830 --> 01:23:40,660
he played footsies with Paul Harris.
I couldn't even believe I did a little.

1450
01:23:41,130 --> 01:23:44,320
Maybe you were what? You had a bad angle
cause you weren't in the beginning.

1451
01:23:44,530 --> 01:23:47,380
You look to you from where you were,
where you were watching it.

1452
01:23:47,381 --> 01:23:48,790
If you watch it again,
watch a commentary.

1453
01:23:49,060 --> 01:23:52,690
It looked like you thought they were
going for lead glocks, but right away,

1454
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:55,000
right from the get go he
pulled in right into the truck.

1455
01:23:55,180 --> 01:23:57,160
It was like a profession.
What I meant by,

1456
01:23:57,161 --> 01:23:59,800
he's on the ground by Paul
Harris is attempting leg locks.

1457
01:23:59,801 --> 01:24:03,950
That's playing footsies in my
opinion. When you're caught
in the truck, that dude,

1458
01:24:03,951 --> 01:24:07,810
it doesn't have any leg locks on you.
Well, he did try a few now there's no,

1459
01:24:08,650 --> 01:24:12,460
he didn't even roll a couple times for
the only when he started attacking his

1460
01:24:12,461 --> 01:24:16,180
legs, that's when he spun out of the
truck and started. When he got away,

1461
01:24:16,270 --> 01:24:20,950
that's when he went after the leg locks.
But while in the truck he was lost.

1462
01:24:20,951 --> 01:24:23,180
He didn't know what he was doing. He was
just defending. That was no leg locks.

1463
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:25,540
You look so confident.
It was almost weird.

1464
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:27,700
It was almost like he
couldn't believe that. I mean,

1465
01:24:27,701 --> 01:24:30,310
I mean Paul Horez like
when he got taken down,

1466
01:24:30,311 --> 01:24:32,140
like what does this guy going to do
to get on the ground? He didn't get,

1467
01:24:32,170 --> 01:24:36,490
he didn't take him down. Paul Horace took
our shot, took Alan Belcher down. Yes,

1468
01:24:36,491 --> 01:24:37,840
he took her Bahara shot,

1469
01:24:37,841 --> 01:24:42,740
took Allen Belts Belcher down and then
Alan Belcher laced in and rolled and got

1470
01:24:42,741 --> 01:24:45,760
the, because he got the single winter,
his head on the outside, which is,

1471
01:24:45,900 --> 01:24:48,340
he couldn't, Alan Belcher could
have took us back at that point,

1472
01:24:48,341 --> 01:24:51,070
but he decided to go to the truck
and it was so crazy to watch.

1473
01:24:51,071 --> 01:24:54,850
And for people who don't know, it's just
an unbelievably rare position in MMA,

1474
01:24:54,851 --> 01:24:58,780
super common around a 10th planet and
Jujitsu, but really rare, in fact,

1475
01:24:58,781 --> 01:25:02,620
so rare that only one guy was ever
submitted with a twister in the UFC.

1476
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:04,310
And that is, um, uh,

1477
01:25:04,330 --> 01:25:07,810
the Korean Zombie chance on Junge
submitted Leonard Garcia with it.

1478
01:25:07,990 --> 01:25:11,120
But that was no battle from the
truck with Koreans, Koreans,

1479
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:15,400
Abi and went from being on Leonard's
back right directly into the twists are,

1480
01:25:15,401 --> 01:25:18,010
there was no battle from the
truck that again, like by the way,

1481
01:25:18,011 --> 01:25:20,440
the truck for folks who don't know
what the fuck we're talking about,

1482
01:25:20,470 --> 01:25:25,470
it's a position where you have one leg
tied up of your opponent with both of

1483
01:25:26,051 --> 01:25:31,030
your legs, his back. But you're at a,
at a perpendicular angle and you're,

1484
01:25:31,031 --> 01:25:35,410
you have like what's
essentially a lockdown from
underneath of this guy's leg.

1485
01:25:35,411 --> 01:25:39,220
So you got his leg completely stiffened
out and you're sort of controlling him

1486
01:25:39,221 --> 01:25:40,560
with it. It's a, it's a,

1487
01:25:40,610 --> 01:25:44,170
it's a great position that a lot of
people don't sort of capitalize on.

1488
01:25:44,350 --> 01:25:48,970
And it was a rare moment on CBS or
excuse me, on Fox and I say CBS,

1489
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:50,470
Oh shit.
Fox going to be mad.

1490
01:25:50,740 --> 01:25:53,770
So rare moment is cause I was trying to
correct my earlier mistake about Jake

1491
01:25:53,771 --> 01:25:58,210
shields submitting Nick Thompson because
it was on elite Xc, not Strikeforce.

1492
01:25:58,330 --> 01:26:02,800
I kept that shit in the back of my head
all this time. Fox. So he's on Fox.

1493
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:04,070
So when when he did it,
when

1494
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:07,120
he went into that position, man, I was
like, I can't even believe, first of all,

1495
01:26:07,130 --> 01:26:09,530
couldn't believe he is. Someone
described it best on the underground.

1496
01:26:09,531 --> 01:26:12,770
They said it was like a dude wrestling
with an alligator and kicking his ass

1497
01:26:13,180 --> 01:26:16,080
like, yeah, what the fuck he's going
to rip your arm off to get to repeal.

1498
01:26:16,180 --> 01:26:17,240
It really was like that.

1499
01:26:17,241 --> 01:26:21,110
But then all of sudden he was like kicking
the alligators ass craze and then he

1500
01:26:21,111 --> 01:26:24,260
escaped the truck after like
a minute he escaped and he,

1501
01:26:24,370 --> 01:26:28,340
then he started attacking Alan
Belcher's legs and your, those,

1502
01:26:28,430 --> 01:26:32,840
his leg locks are so scary. You're a
commentary or have you heard it yet?

1503
01:26:32,900 --> 01:26:36,500
Have you went back? No, no, no. Dude, you
gotta listen to your commentary. You're,

1504
01:26:37,550 --> 01:26:39,890
you're like Alan Belcher's mother.

1505
01:26:41,470 --> 01:26:44,540
You're so worried about how that,
but I shouldn't tell people.

1506
01:26:44,541 --> 01:26:46,280
I've had three knee operations,

1507
01:26:46,281 --> 01:26:50,840
so in any ever a guy like Paul Harris is
going for, he'll look, I fucking panic.

1508
01:26:51,170 --> 01:26:52,003
I feel it.

1509
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:56,600
I feel that shit go spit out.

1510
01:26:56,660 --> 01:26:59,690
You can make it. It was, he can
Rhea steered. It was hilarious.

1511
01:26:59,691 --> 01:27:03,350
He was so passionate about it. You were
so worried about, cause Alan Belcher,

1512
01:27:03,380 --> 01:27:06,410
a friend of ours, he's been dimensions
a couple of times. And by the way,

1513
01:27:06,411 --> 01:27:09,290
you know Eddie and I actually
had a conversation about
this fight before and we

1514
01:27:09,291 --> 01:27:10,970
were like, you know, what do you
think's going to happen in that fight?

1515
01:27:11,180 --> 01:27:11,811
And like look,

1516
01:27:11,811 --> 01:27:16,130
I love watching Paul Horas crushed
boots but I love Alan Belcher too.

1517
01:27:16,131 --> 01:27:19,970
I'm just hoping to see a good experience.
I'm so, I'm hoping to see a good fight.

1518
01:27:20,210 --> 01:27:23,720
I never would have predicted that it
would have went like that where Alan

1519
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:26,900
Belcher was so comfortable on the
ground with him. Man. He brought it up.

1520
01:27:26,910 --> 01:27:31,910
10 Dean lister and Daniel Marae high
level Jujitsu players and especially dean

1521
01:27:34,311 --> 01:27:37,820
lister, cause he's always been known
on the west coast is a leg lock mass.

1522
01:27:37,820 --> 01:27:39,160
You submitted Cocker Reco,

1523
01:27:39,570 --> 01:27:44,570
he won the absolute knob Udag
straight leg locks go man.

1524
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:49,430
Dean was tough to beat. Super Tech
top five talking about world, super,

1525
01:27:49,431 --> 01:27:54,320
super technical. So Alan Belcher
being the smart guy that he is,

1526
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:56,690
he brings, you know, he's
fighting Paul hard shit.

1527
01:27:56,691 --> 01:28:00,410
You better bring in someone like that.
You better bring in fucking Josh Barnett.

1528
01:28:00,411 --> 01:28:04,400
You better bring in Dude's that
that a rip legs off on the daily.

1529
01:28:04,430 --> 01:28:09,100
Oh Alan Belcher has a very high degree
of don't give a fuck to Belcher.

1530
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:10,010
Could fight man.

1531
01:28:10,610 --> 01:28:14,540
You have to have so much confidence to
just throw yourself at that guy like in a,

1532
01:28:14,541 --> 01:28:17,720
in a ground war and and come out of it
all time him and stay in his garden.

1533
01:28:17,721 --> 01:28:19,820
Beat the fuck out of him from his world.

1534
01:28:20,130 --> 01:28:23,660
That's the first time I ever had
a conversation with Alan Belcher.

1535
01:28:23,930 --> 01:28:28,210
He beat the shit out of somebody and
I'd never talked to him before and I'm

1536
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:31,480
pretty sure you know all those.
UFC is eight straight years of UFC is,

1537
01:28:31,490 --> 01:28:34,700
I get them all mixed up but I'm pretty
sure it was in London or something like

1538
01:28:34,701 --> 01:28:38,860
that. It was at an after party at
the bar. He passed by me and he,

1539
01:28:38,870 --> 01:28:41,030
we kind of like caught eyes and
we never talked to each other.

1540
01:28:41,031 --> 01:28:43,870
The four and then I, then we, then our
eyes locked and I say decent liquor,

1541
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:46,340
romance like the notebook.
It was like, it was a good,

1542
01:28:46,341 --> 01:28:49,400
like an awkward thing in the beginning.
It was because he really didn't say much.

1543
01:28:49,401 --> 01:28:52,370
I did all the talking. I
just said, dude, I mean I,

1544
01:28:52,371 --> 01:28:56,180
I'd watch fucking fights like a
motherfucker. I work for the show.

1545
01:28:56,181 --> 01:29:01,060
I never seen anybody with fire.
He has this fire inside of them is theory.

1546
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:06,360
And that's what I noticed from Alan
like way back that he's so fearless.

1547
01:29:06,361 --> 01:29:10,530
He doesn't give a fuck, you know?
And at that point, you know,

1548
01:29:10,531 --> 01:29:12,990
he wasn't known as the greatest
striker in the world and he,

1549
01:29:13,050 --> 01:29:15,480
and he definitely wasn't known
as the ultimate submission guy.

1550
01:29:15,570 --> 01:29:18,070
He was a well rounded guy who,
uh,

1551
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:22,950
was probably best at striking and
man without fearlessness for me,

1552
01:29:22,951 --> 01:29:26,460
I just thought, man, if he just got
really good at Hugh Jitsu, fuck,

1553
01:29:26,461 --> 01:29:29,700
and then you add that
fearlessness on top of it. Dude,

1554
01:29:29,701 --> 01:29:33,960
he fucked up that guy on the
ground and it's so crazy.

1555
01:29:34,110 --> 01:29:35,340
It was so crazy to watch.

1556
01:29:35,890 --> 01:29:40,330
And His standup is nasty and Duke Roufus
is such a good trainer, man. Duke,

1557
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:45,180
Duke Roufus is so fucking technical.
I've worked out with him a few times now.

1558
01:29:45,181 --> 01:29:48,390
And when you work out with a guy and
he sort of explains his philosophy for

1559
01:29:48,391 --> 01:29:49,710
teaching this,
why you're doing that,

1560
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:54,000
there's very few guys who could do
it as good as Duke does and he just,

1561
01:29:54,450 --> 01:29:58,200
he's just a really good guy too. And all
of his guys like, well, they'll like Alan,

1562
01:29:58,201 --> 01:30:01,650
don't like, they're cool guys. You know,
it trickles down from the top fearless.

1563
01:30:02,370 --> 01:30:04,380
You know what? I broke down, I
don't know if you've seen this.

1564
01:30:04,381 --> 01:30:08,690
I released it early this morning.
I did a, a video breakdowns,

1565
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:12,810
technical breakdown of what exactly what
Alan Belcher went through in the truck.

1566
01:30:12,870 --> 01:30:14,850
I really didn't get into the
leg locks much or anything,

1567
01:30:14,851 --> 01:30:19,851
but you can go on youtube and just
punch in Eddie Bravo breaks down Alan

1568
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:22,530
Belcher's twist her attempts or whatever.
Um,

1569
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:27,390
if you're interested in knowing exactly
how it went down, I broke it, Dan on man.

1570
01:30:27,391 --> 01:30:31,860
So it's out there on youtube. I
just released it today. So anyways,

1571
01:30:31,861 --> 01:30:36,861
what about Pat Barry and
Lavar Johnson whole holy Geez,

1572
01:30:37,231 --> 01:30:40,470
that was scary, man.
That was, that was scary.

1573
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:43,590
That guy hits fucking hard.
First of all,

1574
01:30:43,591 --> 01:30:45,840
I couldn't believe that Pat
Mary not only got him down,

1575
01:30:45,841 --> 01:30:49,410
but mountain em and then hopped over
to sign control. I was like, Whoa,

1576
01:30:49,411 --> 01:30:51,210
what's going on here man?
I was like,

1577
01:30:51,211 --> 01:30:55,530
what if we see Pat Berry fucking spin on
a Samurai or some shit? What did we see?

1578
01:30:55,531 --> 01:30:57,750
Pat Barry do the Ninja take us back.

1579
01:30:57,810 --> 01:31:01,560
Can you imagine if Pat Barry just got
like wicked good at submitting guys and

1580
01:31:01,561 --> 01:31:05,400
the ground? He's a strong mother fucker,
dude. Pat Barry is strong as shit.

1581
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:09,050
When Christian more craft had him
down in his last fight, he that is,

1582
01:31:09,051 --> 01:31:10,560
that's a big dude,
that more craft.

1583
01:31:10,561 --> 01:31:13,530
He's a big motherfucker and he
had buried down Barry escape,

1584
01:31:13,531 --> 01:31:17,010
got back up to his feet, did got
away from a submission escaping up,

1585
01:31:17,011 --> 01:31:19,500
back up to his feet. He never
used to be able to do that before,

1586
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:23,760
but he got fucking caught against that
cage with that big Lavar Johnson man,

1587
01:31:23,900 --> 01:31:28,710
that guy, it's so hard. He, you know
Joe Joe or Dan said it best. He said,

1588
01:31:28,711 --> 01:31:32,220
he was like, oh no. It wasn't. Show deals
with Tony Jr. Tommy Jr said it best.

1589
01:31:32,221 --> 01:31:34,560
He's like,
he's like old school Earnie shavers.

1590
01:31:34,890 --> 01:31:39,630
Like the way he's throwing these bombs.
I mean he's just a power puncher man.

1591
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:44,970
Yeah, that was, that was ugly to watch,
man. Pat Barry such a nice guy. You know,

1592
01:31:44,971 --> 01:31:48,710
it's like I don't he,
it was like a Tommy Morrison beating.

1593
01:31:50,010 --> 01:31:53,670
Yeah. Yeah. You want to Google
an awesome boxing match.

1594
01:31:53,671 --> 01:31:57,510
Tommy Tommy Morrison versus a ray Mercer.

1595
01:31:57,750 --> 01:31:59,800
That's one of the most
brutal beatings ever

1596
01:32:00,030 --> 01:32:04,570
to it. Have you seen Tommy Morrison?
Now he has HIV, right? Oh Dude.

1597
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:07,510
You, you haven't seen shit.
You haven't seen Tommy Mars.

1598
01:32:07,540 --> 01:32:10,930
What does he really skinny? Oh my God,
dude, you wouldn't even believe it.

1599
01:32:11,170 --> 01:32:13,870
First of all, he looks
like, like, he's like,

1600
01:32:13,871 --> 01:32:15,760
they just grabbed him from under a bridge,

1601
01:32:15,940 --> 01:32:19,660
pulled the needle out of his arm and just
washed him down and put them in front

1602
01:32:19,661 --> 01:32:23,670
of a camera. I mean, he couldn't
look any an unhealthy. Wow. And it's,

1603
01:32:23,671 --> 01:32:27,700
it's so sad to listen to him talk
because you know, at one point in time,

1604
01:32:27,910 --> 01:32:31,420
you know, you go back to like when he was
on rocky dude, he was a movie star. Okay.

1605
01:32:31,540 --> 01:32:36,180
This fucking guy was with
Sylvester Stallone in a movie
and he plays Tommi Gunn.

1606
01:32:36,190 --> 01:32:37,170
He's out there not to be like,

1607
01:32:37,171 --> 01:32:39,310
he's a fucking star of the
movie next two semesters alone.

1608
01:32:39,830 --> 01:32:41,390
It's God damn Tommy Nelson.

1609
01:32:41,470 --> 01:32:45,580
I all I remember is that movie
was so bad that when they do, uh,

1610
01:32:45,590 --> 01:32:49,380
rocky marathons, they always leave
part five out. Did you notice that?

1611
01:32:49,790 --> 01:32:53,340
They never get the five.
How quick is he?

1612
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:57,130
Almost like it wasn't how he
did rocky six. He's lucky.

1613
01:32:57,370 --> 01:33:02,000
He's out of his fucking mind.
He's got to be out of his fucking mind.

1614
01:33:05,860 --> 01:33:08,550
What are you looking for looking for
Tommy Morrison interview and you just have

1615
01:33:08,551 --> 01:33:12,100
to say shit. Yeah, it doesn't even,
it doesn't even look real man.

1616
01:33:12,670 --> 01:33:16,330
It doesn't even look real. It, you'll,
you'll, it's, it's, it's scary.

1617
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:18,310
Nobody was more nervous than him

1618
01:33:18,470 --> 01:33:20,270
fighting.
That was always his,

1619
01:33:21,020 --> 01:33:24,650
something he had to overcome
before every one of his fights.

1620
01:33:24,651 --> 01:33:28,820
Like they talk about her in an interview
is like the pre fight stuff is we'll,

1621
01:33:28,850 --> 01:33:33,210
how nervous will he be and will it have,
how will it affect his cart? He Oh, right.

1622
01:33:33,211 --> 01:33:33,370
Yeah.

1623
01:33:33,370 --> 01:33:37,910
Shit, right? Yeah. He, that poor
guy, man. He always had a hard time

1624
01:33:38,700 --> 01:33:41,760
and amazing left hook
for a white heavy weight.

1625
01:33:41,790 --> 01:33:45,960
He was the last great white heavyweight,
not including the European sound.

1626
01:33:45,961 --> 01:33:49,450
Call them regular whites.
Those are regular wines.

1627
01:33:49,470 --> 01:33:53,520
I'm talking about like a west
goes the clinicals. I don't count

1628
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:58,440
Russian does that doesn't count.
What? Are They Armenian or something?

1629
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:03,300
They're a Lithuanian. No, they're the
Russian. There's strict Gresham. Wow.

1630
01:34:03,330 --> 01:34:06,960
Why do I want to say, um, I don't
know why I don't count the Ukrainian.

1631
01:34:06,961 --> 01:34:11,850
I might be wrong. I guess
that's why does Fuck Huh? Yeah,

1632
01:34:11,851 --> 01:34:16,040
I would say that's why it's fun,
man. That's okay. Okay. Okay.

1633
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:17,093
All right.

1634
01:34:18,030 --> 01:34:21,690
American whites and say that the last
great American white heavy weight was

1635
01:34:21,691 --> 01:34:25,500
Tommy Morrison, right? Yeah. There
wasn't anybody else. Gerry Cooney,

1636
01:34:26,010 --> 01:34:29,070
Gerry Cooney before him and Tex
Cobb beforehand, and that's it.

1637
01:34:29,100 --> 01:34:30,150
I remember when I was in high school.

1638
01:34:30,151 --> 01:34:33,930
I want to Gerry Cooney to beat Larry
Holmes because he was white cause I

1639
01:34:33,931 --> 01:34:35,430
couldn't believe because
this one I was fighting,

1640
01:34:35,431 --> 01:34:38,270
I couldn't believe how bad white dudes
would get their asses kicked. Oh,

1641
01:34:38,280 --> 01:34:38,551
he's like,

1642
01:34:38,551 --> 01:34:41,520
I was always rooting for white guys like
Bobby Chez because you feel sorry for

1643
01:34:41,521 --> 01:34:45,090
him. Love Bobby Chez because he was super
intelligent. He was a member of Mensa.

1644
01:34:45,180 --> 01:34:46,350
You remember when Bobby chairs just do,

1645
01:34:46,351 --> 01:34:48,840
I don't know why Bobby Chez
stopped doing boxing commentary,

1646
01:34:48,930 --> 01:34:51,450
but he was my all time favorite.
He was my favorite.

1647
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:56,280
I love it because first of all, he was the
real deal. He's a fucking animal. Bobby.

1648
01:34:56,281 --> 01:35:00,380
Bobby Chaz. Whoa. What about Vinny Paz?
The ends, that one. That sound was me.

1649
01:35:00,381 --> 01:35:02,840
Ladies and Gentlemen,
he fought Roy Jones jr sound man.

1650
01:35:02,841 --> 01:35:06,830
Remember he don't touch it. He went a
whole round without touching Roy Jones Jr.

1651
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:10,040
Yeah. Let me see if this shit
works. I think it should work.

1652
01:35:12,470 --> 01:35:14,380
Do you hear that okay?
Yeah,

1653
01:35:14,980 --> 01:35:19,520
that this is, I'm going to show, this
is a really recent Tommy Mars. It Shit.

1654
01:35:25,330 --> 01:35:27,210
Can you hear that? I get
here. It is. It gonna hurt me.

1655
01:35:27,220 --> 01:35:30,940
Tell me the headphones though. It's not
really coming through the headphones,

1656
01:35:30,941 --> 01:35:31,930
but should be

1657
01:35:37,310 --> 01:35:38,143
okay.

1658
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:41,810
Here we go. Here he is. Look at him

1659
01:35:48,610 --> 01:35:50,720
because it was worth
it and then it stopped.

1660
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:52,513
Yeah,

1661
01:35:55,010 --> 01:35:59,090
he looks like the Little Kid's father
on a Freddy got fingered the little kid

1662
01:35:59,091 --> 01:36:00,830
that always gets fucked up.
His father,

1663
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:08,860
my mother was a stay at home mom

1664
01:36:13,380 --> 01:36:16,260
then I was only out of school for a year.

1665
01:36:16,570 --> 01:36:18,210
And when I was just thinking
here in high school,

1666
01:36:19,470 --> 01:36:23,740
which was a 1988 and my mother wanted me
to fight in the Kansas city gold gloves

1667
01:36:26,110 --> 01:36:30,620
exactly the same age. I
graduated in 98 too, you know.

1668
01:36:31,950 --> 01:36:35,040
And uh,
once I started getting into that

1669
01:36:37,870 --> 01:36:42,410
mindset, kicked here wardrobe,
totally focused on it and,

1670
01:36:42,820 --> 01:36:46,570
and you know, the fighting is what I
love, you know, and I dropped the hat.

1671
01:36:46,571 --> 01:36:51,571
I mean it's just when I was put
here to do whatever it takes to win,

1672
01:36:52,460 --> 01:36:53,810
that's what I'm willing to do.

1673
01:36:54,330 --> 01:36:55,390
What the fuck man?

1674
01:36:57,720 --> 01:37:02,220
He looks like he's 65. It's incredible.
I feel bad. He's 42 years old.

1675
01:37:02,250 --> 01:37:04,480
That dude at one point in time,
first of all,

1676
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:07,520
must have been getting
train loads of pussy.

1677
01:37:07,521 --> 01:37:10,450
It must've been just stopping off at
his house. Yeah. He's the first guy.

1678
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:14,010
First guy ever to get
HIV from straight sex.

1679
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:18,570
I mean who knows? I mean the other
dude must just wore his deck out. Yeah,

1680
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:23,960
and then he went crazy and gut like chest
implants. Have you seen that yet? He,

1681
01:37:23,970 --> 01:37:26,430
for folks who don't know,
just Google that and take a look at that.

1682
01:37:26,850 --> 01:37:28,320
You want to see what's,
what's really

1683
01:37:29,230 --> 01:37:32,890
crazy guy got implants in his chest.

1684
01:37:33,190 --> 01:37:35,620
This thing is making noise here.

1685
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:42,760
The guy got an implants like like stripper
implants to make his boobs bigger.

1686
01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:47,870
That's if that's not a sure sign of
you losing your fucking marbles. Yeah.

1687
01:37:47,950 --> 01:37:50,440
Someone needs to pull you aside and go,
dude, what do you, what are you smoking?

1688
01:37:51,100 --> 01:37:54,400
What's going on here man? You're gonna
what? You're gonna get a boob job.

1689
01:37:54,990 --> 01:37:58,170
You know what I'm saying? He's your man,
dude. He just gained glamor. Her sexy.

1690
01:37:58,180 --> 01:38:02,730
Now it's up titties. Tired of doing
bench. It just outside of benching.

1691
01:38:03,020 --> 01:38:05,630
Hard to benching,
kept a lot of his other muscles but,

1692
01:38:05,720 --> 01:38:10,720
but just our own Jorma tinnies probably
just missed having full Ted's given good

1693
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:13,650
manly. I got really big. You
think girls that there'd be,

1694
01:38:13,651 --> 01:38:18,030
some girls are in the fake boobies.
I like fake packs.

1695
01:38:18,060 --> 01:38:20,220
I don't think a man is
allowed to pull off fake shit.

1696
01:38:20,250 --> 01:38:21,630
That's what girls could wear.
Wigs.

1697
01:38:21,930 --> 01:38:26,910
Girls could wear a hair weaves and fake
eyelashes and Vicon have fake teeth.

1698
01:38:27,180 --> 01:38:30,480
They're going to have everything as long
as it look good lens. It looks good.

1699
01:38:31,020 --> 01:38:31,801
I mean it was my,

1700
01:38:31,801 --> 01:38:36,780
I did a bit in my recent special about
how fake tits confused a lot of people

1701
01:38:36,870 --> 01:38:38,490
because everyone knows that they're fake.

1702
01:38:38,610 --> 01:38:42,900
There's no confusion whatsoever that
they're fake. It's so worst trick ever.

1703
01:38:43,140 --> 01:38:46,320
Cause it's a trick that everybody knows
is an incision. There's a bag of water.

1704
01:38:46,321 --> 01:38:50,010
They stuffed it inside and stretch the
skin out and then stitched it all up and

1705
01:38:50,011 --> 01:38:54,540
we don't care. We'll go here like,
yeah, we can't make some stick out.

1706
01:38:55,160 --> 01:38:57,960
Like we're,
we're s that shape is so primitive.

1707
01:38:58,140 --> 01:39:03,090
It's so primally satisfying when a girl
has a great body and a girl has nice

1708
01:39:03,091 --> 01:39:05,850
tits and they do not have to be
big. You know, I don't, I don't,

1709
01:39:06,180 --> 01:39:09,570
it doesn't bother me. I like small tits.
It doesn't, it doesn't bother me at all.

1710
01:39:09,630 --> 01:39:12,450
As long as she has a nice body.
Like a girl with a nice ass is like,

1711
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:16,490
it's so much more important than, than
fake boobs. Yeah. When I take a shower,

1712
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:18,490
my girlfriend's hair extensions are all,

1713
01:39:18,491 --> 01:39:22,620
I can't in the shower and I don't
give a shit. Like you wouldn't care.

1714
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:27,300
I call it Brittany or to badge in
if you had hair extensions. Oh Man.

1715
01:39:27,830 --> 01:39:28,470
And she,
you know,

1716
01:39:28,470 --> 01:39:30,830
if like you ever gotten a fight with
the chicks should call you on that show.

1717
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:35,160
How bout some level you're not insecure.
How about your fucking hair extensions?

1718
01:39:35,161 --> 01:39:35,640
Huh?

1719
01:39:35,640 --> 01:39:39,600
How about celebrities that were two pays
and everyone knows it's to pay and then

1720
01:39:39,601 --> 01:39:42,840
I just can't stop. Yeah.
Like Burt Reynolds, like he,
he'll like joke about it.

1721
01:39:42,990 --> 01:39:44,640
I don't think he can do anything.

1722
01:39:44,670 --> 01:39:49,110
I think Burt Reynolds is at this this
point where it's become like a Joan Rivers

1723
01:39:49,111 --> 01:39:53,120
sort of a thing where it's just,
this is off the tracks and into the woods.

1724
01:39:53,140 --> 01:39:57,840
You're nuts. It's got to the point
where like, he's crazy. He's,

1725
01:39:57,841 --> 01:39:59,160
he's constantly getting in his face,

1726
01:39:59,161 --> 01:40:04,161
like pulled back and g's ever see
Kenny Rogers back when he had his,

1727
01:40:04,261 --> 01:40:08,100
uh, you got to know and the whole
loop, he was old than the 70.

1728
01:40:08,101 --> 01:40:11,810
[inaudible] when the phone, well, he
got a lot of crazy plastic surgery now.

1729
01:40:11,820 --> 01:40:13,310
He doesn't even look like himself anymore.

1730
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:17,850
It looks like a totally different
human beings. Yeah, I dunno man.

1731
01:40:17,851 --> 01:40:19,320
So that's a weird thing.

1732
01:40:19,620 --> 01:40:22,590
You gotta you gotta let it go when
your face starts falling apart,

1733
01:40:22,830 --> 01:40:27,480
you just got to take up fishing.
Find yourself a hobby man, you know,

1734
01:40:27,481 --> 01:40:30,540
and take it from me. The guy who
had hair transplants, you know,

1735
01:40:30,541 --> 01:40:32,190
it was one of the dumbest
things I ever did.

1736
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:35,820
I thought it was going to be able
to fix my hair loss with surgery.

1737
01:40:36,120 --> 01:40:40,530
Not even considering the fact that it
leaves this big chunk of meat scar in the

1738
01:40:40,531 --> 01:40:44,010
back of your head. You know, they take
care out of here and move it up here.

1739
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:47,460
It's ridiculous, you know,
and it scars you for life.

1740
01:40:47,461 --> 01:40:50,280
Like you can never make
that decision go away.

1741
01:40:50,460 --> 01:40:54,110
The infomercials are fucking killer.
You know what dude?

1742
01:40:54,310 --> 01:40:57,310
There's like, he has three chicks, he's
in a pool, he's got a full head of hair.

1743
01:40:58,150 --> 01:40:59,270
You can work for some people.

1744
01:40:59,330 --> 01:41:02,090
So for some people it's good if
it was good for me for awhile,

1745
01:41:02,210 --> 01:41:03,300
but the problem is like,

1746
01:41:03,390 --> 01:41:06,980
I do a joke about it saying that it's
like moving a bunch of really healthy

1747
01:41:06,981 --> 01:41:08,990
people into a neighborhood
where everybody's dying.

1748
01:41:09,380 --> 01:41:12,230
Cause that's what it's really like.
All the other hair starts falling out too.

1749
01:41:12,440 --> 01:41:16,040
Like it's destined. Most of it's
destined to fall out like half. You know?

1750
01:41:16,041 --> 01:41:19,440
Most people in my family on my mom's side,
they're like kind of half fish, bald,

1751
01:41:19,441 --> 01:41:22,160
like all over here, a little bit bottle
with it. It's going, it's going to go,

1752
01:41:22,190 --> 01:41:22,760
it's going to go.

1753
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:26,330
So if you patch up the spots where it's
gone a little bit and then you look,

1754
01:41:26,331 --> 01:41:29,810
I'm pretty good for a couple of years and
then the other spots start falling off

1755
01:41:29,900 --> 01:41:31,950
and then what are you going do?
Are you going to keep implanting hair?

1756
01:41:31,990 --> 01:41:36,590
Their asshole after a while becomes
embarrassing. It becomes stupid. Yeah.

1757
01:41:36,591 --> 01:41:40,700
It becomes like a little trap that you've
fos, like forced yourself into. I go,

1758
01:41:40,701 --> 01:41:42,710
I go to this trap,
I gotta take care of this gross hair.

1759
01:41:42,711 --> 01:41:46,340
Now I gotta figure out how to fucking
make it look like there's more of it than

1760
01:41:46,341 --> 01:41:50,510
it is. Yeah. I should be totally bald
by now. You say that man. But you know,

1761
01:41:50,750 --> 01:41:53,520
I just don't, I think you're
wrong. I think I missed,

1762
01:41:54,430 --> 01:41:55,960
I stopped at Man.
I started,

1763
01:41:56,020 --> 01:41:58,990
I was so worried about my hair because
growing up I had long hair and those

1764
01:41:58,991 --> 01:42:02,050
backward long hair got you mad
pussy and it was everything to me.

1765
01:42:02,530 --> 01:42:05,380
I would have nightmares about
having short hair, you know,

1766
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:09,610
and I was nine 10 so funny.
I'll never forget my aunt my,

1767
01:42:09,770 --> 01:42:12,130
cause you used to have nightmares
of having short hair. Yeah.

1768
01:42:12,550 --> 01:42:14,220
I used to have nightmares
of what I met Eddie.

1769
01:42:14,310 --> 01:42:17,430
He used to wear like a Hindu rap.
He used to,

1770
01:42:17,460 --> 01:42:19,080
he used to do Jujitsu would like his,

1771
01:42:19,081 --> 01:42:22,440
his hair would be like tied up in
some fucking scuba diving outfit.

1772
01:42:22,550 --> 01:42:27,400
Yeah. I, we used to tie it, uh, I used to
tie my hair used to go down to my waist.

1773
01:42:27,420 --> 01:42:31,850
I would like double up the ponytail and
then I used to wear just a Bandanna Bro.

1774
01:42:31,860 --> 01:42:33,620
Like fucking axl rose.

1775
01:42:33,830 --> 01:42:37,910
And then I would put ear guards over
it just to hold a Bandana in place.

1776
01:42:37,911 --> 01:42:40,520
People thought I was worried about my
ears. I really wasn't worried about Myers.

1777
01:42:40,610 --> 01:42:43,500
I just needed something to hold the
Bandana up. She'd be hair in place. Yeah.

1778
01:42:43,501 --> 01:42:47,630
And then some guy down in that when the
Machados we're down in Redondo beach,

1779
01:42:47,690 --> 01:42:51,620
some surfer dude goes, Bro, man, you
should just wear a divers hood, man.

1780
01:42:51,830 --> 01:42:52,880
I could diverse HUD.

1781
01:42:53,060 --> 01:42:57,230
You mean like Jacques Cousteau goes so
you're going with chocolate is still put

1782
01:42:57,231 --> 01:42:58,160
on a mask.
You know,

1783
01:42:58,161 --> 01:43:01,430
the shit that's all around is that
I ended up going to a surf shop.

1784
01:43:01,430 --> 01:43:04,670
This dude told me where I went to
the surf shop, bought a diver side,

1785
01:43:04,671 --> 01:43:06,410
I could die a scuba fucking store,

1786
01:43:06,590 --> 01:43:11,030
bought a divers hood and I would wear
in the divers would on its own and

1787
01:43:11,031 --> 01:43:13,040
grappling cause it did
hold on my shit together.

1788
01:43:13,370 --> 01:43:15,080
That would look fucking ridiculous.

1789
01:43:15,081 --> 01:43:18,030
But with a big ass your guards
that got the biggest ones do,

1790
01:43:18,031 --> 01:43:21,320
they were marooned giant ear guard so
that people really didn't notice that I

1791
01:43:21,321 --> 01:43:26,220
was wearing scuba gear and and I competed
with that motherfucker. People always,

1792
01:43:26,450 --> 01:43:29,180
people still come up to me to stay cause
dude I remember seeing you at an old

1793
01:43:29,181 --> 01:43:32,930
Joe Merera tournament man and use your,
the duties to where the scuba gear.

1794
01:43:33,080 --> 01:43:37,250
So it's basically a rash guard helmet
sort of a thing. Yeah. That's Kinda dope.

1795
01:43:37,410 --> 01:43:38,243
Yeah.

1796
01:43:40,100 --> 01:43:43,980
The, the problem with all the scrapes
and scratches and shit you get,

1797
01:43:44,130 --> 01:43:47,460
that's where you could possibly
get ringworm and staff. I like,

1798
01:43:47,461 --> 01:43:50,580
I've been wearing tights lately and
that you feel like a dancer out there.

1799
01:43:50,740 --> 01:43:54,500
You feel something a little funny about
a man wearing tights but I got over that

1800
01:43:54,501 --> 01:43:55,180
shit really quick.

1801
01:43:55,180 --> 01:43:57,520
What's wrong with g pants,
man. I like the pants.

1802
01:43:58,510 --> 01:44:01,930
I think better protection with the tights.
I don't know.

1803
01:44:01,990 --> 01:44:03,330
I think it's skin tight everywhere.

1804
01:44:03,340 --> 01:44:05,980
He just liked to show off your mark
and Mugler legs. That's what I like.

1805
01:44:06,100 --> 01:44:10,600
I like just walking in with my big Hams.
Let everybody know what the fuck is up.

1806
01:44:10,630 --> 01:44:14,500
Yeah man. When and all my uncles
went bald, like in their thirties.

1807
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:18,030
And my aunts knew how much my hair
meant to me and my answered say, Ah,

1808
01:44:18,120 --> 01:44:21,310
I'll never forget my aunt patty
goes, oh look, because we're all,

1809
01:44:21,311 --> 01:44:26,080
we all lose our hair. Plus we're born
with a ridiculous large, uh, forehand.

1810
01:44:26,081 --> 01:44:28,660
Like all my aunts think they're losing
their hair because they have a giant

1811
01:44:28,661 --> 01:44:32,410
forehead. So we're born with giant
foreheads and I don't know, my aunt patty,

1812
01:44:32,411 --> 01:44:37,210
I was 19 hair longer than a motherfucker.
Oh No. In the height of metal,

1813
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:42,280
the height of metal. Um, my aunt patty
goes, oh look, he's losing his hair. Ah,

1814
01:44:42,580 --> 01:44:46,630
you're going to be all sad. Would you go
bald? And I'm like, oh, so right away,

1815
01:44:47,200 --> 01:44:49,420
right away. I'm like, fuck.
But that was good because,

1816
01:44:49,540 --> 01:44:52,960
because that motivated me to go get
some Rogaine and back then you need a

1817
01:44:52,961 --> 01:44:56,590
prescription to get Rhogam. I had to
go to a doctor. The doctor's like,

1818
01:44:56,591 --> 01:44:58,870
you're 19 years old, he'd do it
in here. I'm like, you know what,

1819
01:44:58,871 --> 01:45:02,320
I'm gonna start early and I just
terrified of losing my hair.

1820
01:45:02,350 --> 01:45:07,350
So I've been on Rogaine since I was 19
so you jumped on it way before it would

1821
01:45:07,421 --> 01:45:11,800
ever kicked in. Yup. Will you taking
the Propecia and everything? I took,

1822
01:45:11,801 --> 01:45:16,490
I took Rogaine from 19 to 30 and when
I was 30 in 2000 that's when they end.

1823
01:45:16,750 --> 01:45:21,100
Propecia came on and then I switched
to Propecia from 30 to 40 didn't use

1824
01:45:21,101 --> 01:45:23,770
Rogaine at all in my thirties it was
just a pill. Every day I take a pill.

1825
01:45:23,950 --> 01:45:27,270
It was beautiful. It keeps the hair on
dude. There's where it works, right?

1826
01:45:27,300 --> 01:45:30,790
I should be bald by now. I really should
be. I'm looking, I have there. I have,

1827
01:45:30,791 --> 01:45:33,190
cause I've been diligent
about just like vitamins.

1828
01:45:33,370 --> 01:45:35,440
I was trying to hold onto
my youth my whole life.

1829
01:45:35,441 --> 01:45:40,180
I was holding onto the youth
and, and uh, you know, at, at 40,

1830
01:45:40,181 --> 01:45:42,790
I decided to go back to rogue game
because I just thought, you know what,

1831
01:45:42,791 --> 01:45:45,970
I don't like taking a pill every
goddamn day. Who Know that I could,

1832
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,510
I could easily,
they actually think it provide for me.

1833
01:45:48,600 --> 01:45:52,470
It can help prevent prostate cancer. But
who knows what, it doesn't. The other end,

1834
01:45:53,170 --> 01:45:55,440
I didn't like taking it
because when I was taking it,

1835
01:45:55,441 --> 01:45:59,790
it was a fucking with my libido and I
didn't even realize it was until I got off

1836
01:45:59,791 --> 01:46:02,110
of it until I ran out of it.
I'm awesome.

1837
01:46:02,130 --> 01:46:05,850
I had these just monster boners all the
time and I was like, what is going on?

1838
01:46:06,150 --> 01:46:08,670
And a feel. I boner,
everybody's different, you know,

1839
01:46:08,671 --> 01:46:11,610
they say it only affects a
certain percentage of people.

1840
01:46:11,611 --> 01:46:12,550
I know other people that are,

1841
01:46:12,551 --> 01:46:15,360
they've had the same problem and I know
other people that actually say that it

1842
01:46:15,361 --> 01:46:19,350
made him Hornier. Oh, what
the fuck? That's all about
it. But it's uh, you know, it,

1843
01:46:19,420 --> 01:46:24,270
it blocks DHT and apparently
DHT is necessary for something,

1844
01:46:24,990 --> 01:46:29,220
some brain function, something athletic
function. Something, I dunno. Yeah man.

1845
01:46:29,340 --> 01:46:33,120
I Dunno. It's funny though. The
whole situation is funny. The,

1846
01:46:33,270 --> 01:46:36,870
there's just clinging to youth, you know,
and it's funny you're open about it.

1847
01:46:36,900 --> 01:46:39,120
You knew, you know, talk about
it really openly. Like, Hey man,

1848
01:46:39,121 --> 01:46:39,980
I'm just trying to clean the youth.

1849
01:46:40,020 --> 01:46:42,750
But for a lot of people that's
like a really shallow thing to say.

1850
01:46:42,751 --> 01:46:47,751
Like I know a lot of people who consider
themselves very well educated and they,

1851
01:46:48,180 --> 01:46:52,380
they consider to be a pretty astute and
our understanding of how other people

1852
01:46:52,381 --> 01:46:55,170
see them.
And so they avoid saying shit like that.

1853
01:46:55,320 --> 01:46:57,900
They avoid saying shit like I'm
just trying to hold onto my youth.

1854
01:46:57,901 --> 01:47:00,860
They don't want to admit that because
it's a frivolous thing. It's not a,

1855
01:47:00,900 --> 01:47:03,120
not a thing for a serious man to consider,

1856
01:47:03,780 --> 01:47:06,360
but the reality is nobody
likes it and that nobody,

1857
01:47:06,361 --> 01:47:11,340
nobody wants to reality and to
death feels good to look good.

1858
01:47:11,340 --> 01:47:15,000
Anybody that says that it doesn't feel
good to look good, they're full of shit.

1859
01:47:15,120 --> 01:47:19,560
If it feels good to look good, I'm just
trying to feel good as much as possible.

1860
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:24,000
That's all you want to, you
want your body to work well too.

1861
01:47:24,001 --> 01:47:25,980
The difference between you
and a lot of other people's,

1862
01:47:25,981 --> 01:47:29,280
you're always using your body for Jujitsu.
So because of that,

1863
01:47:29,281 --> 01:47:31,020
your body is like a race car.
I mean,

1864
01:47:31,021 --> 01:47:34,020
we've had these conversations before
we talk about lifting. It's like when,

1865
01:47:34,021 --> 01:47:37,170
when you concentrate on a rigorous
strength and conditioning program,

1866
01:47:37,171 --> 01:47:40,130
you decide what kind of engine
your race car has. You know?

1867
01:47:40,140 --> 01:47:42,600
And if you're one of those motherfuckers
like, what's that dude's name?

1868
01:47:42,601 --> 01:47:46,350
He used to train at your place to
wrestle. Eric, a really strong guy.

1869
01:47:46,730 --> 01:47:47,563
Fuck's his name.

1870
01:47:48,090 --> 01:47:52,290
Eric number four in the nation
that got Bradley or Bradley Dude.

1871
01:47:52,380 --> 01:47:56,850
I remember doing drills with this guy
and we were doing neon stomach drills and

1872
01:47:56,851 --> 01:48:00,750
this motherfucker, I got a pretty good
neon stomach. I can hold some dude's down.

1873
01:48:00,840 --> 01:48:05,190
This motherfucker launched me through the
air like, like he had like ridiculous,

1874
01:48:05,191 --> 01:48:07,680
like physical strength,
like ridiculous physical strength.

1875
01:48:08,130 --> 01:48:11,610
And when you talked about it, he was
like, he, he would never miss his lift.

1876
01:48:11,780 --> 01:48:14,280
I remember he was talking about at once.
So I gotta get my lift in.

1877
01:48:14,310 --> 01:48:17,550
I don't miss my left. It was all like, I
don't know what the exactly the lift was,

1878
01:48:17,670 --> 01:48:20,970
but it was very obviously like a series
of strength and conditioning was like

1879
01:48:20,971 --> 01:48:23,190
you're like clean and press or
something like that with a lot of those.

1880
01:48:23,191 --> 01:48:26,460
Like you ever see the Randy
coture set that he does? No.

1881
01:48:26,820 --> 01:48:29,850
Randy is a fascinating one because Randy
does it all with real lightweights.

1882
01:48:30,150 --> 01:48:32,060
He does it with like a a barbell,

1883
01:48:32,100 --> 01:48:36,450
a big bar bout with like a
45 not even, not even. Yeah,

1884
01:48:36,451 --> 01:48:40,860
like a 25 on each side. Really? Yeah Dude.
He but he doesn't stop. I mean it's, it's,

1885
01:48:40,861 --> 01:48:45,270
it's a funnel of exercises,
a fuck load of reps and what he does,

1886
01:48:45,271 --> 01:48:50,271
he says what that does is really much
more mimics fighting than full blast bench

1887
01:48:50,521 --> 01:48:54,570
presses and full blast squats and
it's more like for muscular endurance.

1888
01:48:54,571 --> 01:48:58,410
It's a motherfucker, dude. I
tried it once. It's a mother,
father, full body stuff.

1889
01:48:58,440 --> 01:49:01,740
Yeah, a lot of full box of, lot of
lunges, a lot of bent over rows,

1890
01:49:01,741 --> 01:49:03,390
all sorts of different shit he does.
It's like a,

1891
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:05,550
there's a whole series of
I'm Randy has them online.

1892
01:49:05,970 --> 01:49:08,680
You know what's really made a
difference in my list. Did I?

1893
01:49:09,230 --> 01:49:13,500
I love doing squats way more now
than ever because of these shoes.

1894
01:49:13,620 --> 01:49:16,920
These are vibrant toe shoes. Eddie,
Eddie Bravo. Where's took dude,

1895
01:49:16,921 --> 01:49:20,640
you just put your dirty foot on my mug.
Now I've got a disk. That's very much it.

1896
01:49:20,820 --> 01:49:23,640
Yeah, but it's in my house. Someone's
got to drink out of it. Out of my house.

1897
01:49:24,020 --> 01:49:26,670
These Vibram shoes are the best.
Don't drink that spot.

1898
01:49:26,700 --> 01:49:30,870
We just touched your dirty
feet on it, man. Oh Dude. I
can't believe you did that.

1899
01:49:31,650 --> 01:49:35,790
Dammit. Doing squats with what these
things are. It feels so good. Yeah.

1900
01:49:35,791 --> 01:49:38,610
I need to take into him. Steve Maxwell
got me into working out barefoot.

1901
01:49:38,700 --> 01:49:41,080
I do all my lifts in barefoot now.
Every house.

1902
01:49:41,370 --> 01:49:44,080
What does he think about these shoes?
He loves him. Yeah. He likes those. He,

1903
01:49:44,090 --> 01:49:48,260
he's a big advocate of flat minimalist
shoes. Yeah, I've got to, um,

1904
01:49:48,340 --> 01:49:50,710
there's a box right over there and with a,
another pair of their,

1905
01:49:50,711 --> 01:49:54,610
they're not toe shoes, but they're
minimalist shoes. Um, yeah,

1906
01:49:54,640 --> 01:49:58,120
I think for lifting weights
and for training, they're
the best. Yeah. The toes.

1907
01:49:58,180 --> 01:50:00,970
A lot of people are weird, like they
don't like wearing them. It looks stupid.

1908
01:50:00,971 --> 01:50:05,050
It looks silly. But uh, I think if you
could get them and they fit right for me,

1909
01:50:05,051 --> 01:50:07,780
I had a hard time getting some of the
toes in, but once I got him in, man,

1910
01:50:08,050 --> 01:50:09,190
it's pretty God damn comfortable.

1911
01:50:09,191 --> 01:50:12,160
And you really do feel your toes
working as individual units,

1912
01:50:12,340 --> 01:50:15,590
which doesn't happen when it's
like one big fixed sneaker. Yeah.

1913
01:50:15,820 --> 01:50:17,020
In a big fixed sneaker.

1914
01:50:17,021 --> 01:50:20,740
It's like trying to like if you
put sneakers on your hands, okay.

1915
01:50:20,741 --> 01:50:23,830
And then try to do bench press with it,
how good would that be?

1916
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:26,730
It wouldn't be so good. You wouldn't
really have that kind of a good control.

1917
01:50:26,731 --> 01:50:31,120
Exactly. And you're gripping
the ground with your toes.
Yeah. It's so huge. I love,

1918
01:50:31,180 --> 01:50:34,880
I love walking now. Just walking
is awesome. I'm a serious,

1919
01:50:35,260 --> 01:50:39,100
maybe I'll get over it in a month or so,
but I really enjoy these shoes.

1920
01:50:39,190 --> 01:50:42,700
Sell much, changing the way
I just function every day.

1921
01:50:42,790 --> 01:50:46,960
I saw some boot versions. They were like,
uh, like it looked like hobbit feet.

1922
01:50:47,100 --> 01:50:49,540
It was on Tim Ferriss, Twitter.
Somebody had tweeted it.

1923
01:50:49,750 --> 01:50:51,880
It's like the same company that does it.

1924
01:50:52,550 --> 01:50:54,570
What does the company that
makes sure as Vibram? Yeah,

1925
01:50:54,580 --> 01:50:56,500
they're vibrams but it's like a boot,

1926
01:50:56,710 --> 01:51:01,710
like a tan leather boots like you could
wear and like I guess you'll be allowed

1927
01:51:01,811 --> 01:51:05,010
to wear that and go out to eat at a nice
restaurant and he'd be a shoe. Yeah,

1928
01:51:05,070 --> 01:51:07,540
they've got to make some cool looking
dressy ones like we were talking about

1929
01:51:07,541 --> 01:51:07,751
earlier,

1930
01:51:07,751 --> 01:51:12,280
like puts it make for on top of it or
something of diamonds or something like

1931
01:51:12,281 --> 01:51:15,070
that. Make up the evil
fake dressy ones. Man,

1932
01:51:15,071 --> 01:51:18,160
there's something weird about someone
walking towards you and you could see

1933
01:51:18,161 --> 01:51:20,110
their toes moving.
You know?

1934
01:51:20,110 --> 01:51:24,100
It's like if for a guy like flip
flops or weird enough, right?

1935
01:51:24,101 --> 01:51:27,310
You're out there showing your toes
hanging around, flip flop in with people.

1936
01:51:27,460 --> 01:51:31,010
But when you're wearing, it's like you're
out at a nice restaurant and a guy.

1937
01:51:31,011 --> 01:51:32,170
I can see your toes move.

1938
01:51:32,380 --> 01:51:36,550
There's something about like our idea of
what it is to go out where that doesn't

1939
01:51:36,551 --> 01:51:38,230
agree with us. You know,
what are you doing?

1940
01:51:38,260 --> 01:51:40,690
You trying to get attention with your
silly shoes. You want the fucker?

1941
01:51:40,810 --> 01:51:42,910
Why can't you remember regular shoes?
Like a regular person?

1942
01:51:42,911 --> 01:51:45,640
Why are you going to be the one guy
who stands out? You silly bitch.

1943
01:51:46,060 --> 01:51:50,570
People talk shit on the shoes like my
girlfriend didn't want like I want her to,

1944
01:51:50,680 --> 01:51:52,360
I wanted them for a year and she's,

1945
01:51:55,910 --> 01:51:56,180
she would

1946
01:51:56,180 --> 01:51:57,890
bring it up to a friend's
and they would laugh at me.

1947
01:51:57,891 --> 01:52:00,980
Oh he want to get those shoes. Those
shoes are ridiculous. I'll you know,

1948
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:05,470
and then finally, finally
I told her either I'm going
to get them. Did he brought,

1949
01:52:05,510 --> 01:52:07,190
do what you need to get
down with the fanny pack.

1950
01:52:07,250 --> 01:52:11,120
That's what you need to get dealt with.
I, I traveled with a fanny pack sign.

1951
01:52:11,121 --> 01:52:14,690
I traveled strong feeling. I got
do two little pockets. Oh son,

1952
01:52:14,720 --> 01:52:19,580
it's so much better. I put my money, I
got my cell phone, all my bullshit too.

1953
01:52:19,581 --> 01:52:24,230
Little zipper pockets, little chapstick
in there. Boom. Schelok log. Boom.

1954
01:52:24,530 --> 01:52:27,440
Come on, man. I leave little.
Uh, I have uh, headphones.

1955
01:52:27,530 --> 01:52:30,790
I have my little headphones or beats, a
little tiny ones. I keep those in there.

1956
01:52:30,791 --> 01:52:33,980
The ear buds. I'm always down to
listen to music if I'm stuck anywhere.

1957
01:52:33,980 --> 01:52:37,970
If I'm traveling, I don't go anywhere
without that fucking fanny pack. Yeah,

1958
01:52:38,240 --> 01:52:42,980
plane ticket. Oh, where's it go? And
very practical. It is dude. You just,

1959
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:46,670
you gotta. You gotta step up
and claim back. I take it back.

1960
01:52:46,730 --> 01:52:49,230
How was it a dude who carry
a man purse for awhile?

1961
01:52:49,250 --> 01:52:52,050
I really remember it used to
bring around your CD's everywhere.

1962
01:52:52,080 --> 01:52:52,970
You brought him everywhere.

1963
01:52:52,971 --> 01:52:55,880
You never wanted to be in a situation
where you wanted to give some anyone you

1964
01:52:55,881 --> 01:53:00,560
didn't exactly have one on. Yeah,
always passed now. Fuck cds.

1965
01:53:00,561 --> 01:53:02,960
You got mp3s now.
Is it an amazing cds?

1966
01:53:02,961 --> 01:53:06,680
Just the solid media is almost useless.
It's on its way out.

1967
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:09,710
Like I go to border books,
you know, and look around.

1968
01:53:09,711 --> 01:53:13,610
They always have like a back section where
they sell movies and in cds and Shit.

1969
01:53:13,611 --> 01:53:15,500
I look, you know, I think
it's funny, you know,

1970
01:53:15,501 --> 01:53:19,480
the CD section just keeps getting
smaller and smaller. You go to best buy,

1971
01:53:19,500 --> 01:53:23,840
just getting smaller and smaller.
We're going to be all living in the cloud.

1972
01:53:23,841 --> 01:53:27,170
Dude sent me a virtual
bookstore and the future, right,

1973
01:53:27,171 --> 01:53:29,870
like a three month thing that you walk
around and he'd just pick out the books.

1974
01:53:30,170 --> 01:53:33,590
Well, I mean it sort of is there now if
you have a kindle or if you have a one of

1975
01:53:33,591 --> 01:53:37,130
those iPads with the, the I book
application, you just go scroll.

1976
01:53:37,131 --> 01:53:41,710
I'll take that book right now. Bang
downloads, images and all guys.

1977
01:53:41,970 --> 01:53:44,950
I found out Marilyn Manson came out
with the new album a couple of days ago.

1978
01:53:44,980 --> 01:53:48,740
Just, Oh, I just buy it on
my phone instantly. Crazy.

1979
01:53:48,770 --> 01:53:50,390
I had my phone on me at all times.

1980
01:53:50,900 --> 01:53:53,660
Can you buy it with three g or do you
have to be connected to the Internet?

1981
01:53:54,890 --> 01:53:57,690
I buy all my shit on three G.
Really? Yep. So you'd get in,

1982
01:53:57,710 --> 01:54:01,300
download the whole album on
three g. Wow. You know those, um,

1983
01:54:01,340 --> 01:54:03,230
those cards that they sell you,
those uh,

1984
01:54:03,260 --> 01:54:07,040
Internet cards and they have a certain
amount of bandwidth do I downloaded one

1985
01:54:07,041 --> 01:54:10,760
movie off iTunes and they sent me a
message and I used up like 50% of my

1986
01:54:10,761 --> 01:54:15,350
bandwidth. One movie. How
much bandwidth do I get?

1987
01:54:15,351 --> 01:54:18,260
You assholes. There was hardly
any more bandwidth. I mean,

1988
01:54:18,261 --> 01:54:22,310
how big is it a movie when you get a
movie on iTunes and never buy movies on

1989
01:54:22,311 --> 01:54:25,940
iTunes? How big can it be though? I mean,

1990
01:54:26,720 --> 01:54:31,250
I would guess big few gigs. I'm not,
I'm still not sure what a Gig is.

1991
01:54:32,370 --> 01:54:35,780
Gigabyte. It's a thousand megabytes.
I know it stands for, I know,

1992
01:54:35,810 --> 01:54:39,670
but I don't know how big
that is. Um, a Gig is like,

1993
01:54:39,720 --> 01:54:44,390
like if you have a big ass photo of
a very, very high resolution photo,

1994
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:48,390
maybe it can be one Gig,
like a,

1995
01:54:48,400 --> 01:54:52,010
a like a good size porno film that
you can save on your hard drive.

1996
01:54:52,310 --> 01:54:56,170
It's an Avi file and you could
watch it for like 15 minutes, man,

1997
01:54:56,180 --> 01:55:01,040
28 Gig if it's really high rate
a breaking down pouring again.

1998
01:55:01,670 --> 01:55:05,220
But it's all depends on the CODEC. So
that's the thing about, uh, there's,

1999
01:55:05,250 --> 01:55:08,870
there's a lot of different standards
when it comes to avionics and pigs,

2000
01:55:08,871 --> 01:55:12,560
mov files, flash files. There's
a lot of different things.

2001
01:55:12,920 --> 01:55:16,430
I mean we live in incredible times and
there's a lot of parallel evolution of

2002
01:55:16,431 --> 01:55:20,570
different sort of formats for videos.
You know, it's, it's pretty incredible.

2003
01:55:20,571 --> 01:55:24,350
And then blu rays, you know, he can't play
brew Blueway on your laptop, a blu rays.

2004
01:55:24,351 --> 01:55:27,520
That shit when it comes to
like high definition, you
know, you watch it, you go,

2005
01:55:27,560 --> 01:55:31,250
you got a blueberry player at home.
You ever watch the ads on my playstation?

2006
01:55:31,251 --> 01:55:33,560
I think. Yeah, there you go.
Yeah. Isn't that incredible?

2007
01:55:33,590 --> 01:55:34,590
I mean how incredible is a playstation?

2008
01:55:34,640 --> 01:55:37,340
It comes with a blue ray
player and you watch those.

2009
01:55:37,341 --> 01:55:42,320
I mean we'll look real bad ass movies
like Avatar and Blu Ray. Ah, stunning.

2010
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:44,070
You can't tell me that doesn't feel good.

2011
01:55:44,250 --> 01:55:47,100
Like that asshole that lives in the caves,
that guy who gave up on money,

2012
01:55:47,550 --> 01:55:50,880
you don't get to experience Avatar Douche
bag. You don't get to experience it.

2013
01:55:51,120 --> 01:55:54,450
You need money for that. James Cameron
is not going to work for fucking food.

2014
01:55:54,480 --> 01:55:56,760
Okay. If a guy's going to
create something like Avatar,

2015
01:55:56,761 --> 01:56:00,420
he wants to live in a castle and drive
a private jet, you know, you gotta,

2016
01:56:00,480 --> 01:56:03,990
you gotta pay a guy like James Cameron
and make a fucking movie like that and

2017
01:56:03,991 --> 01:56:04,470
you're not gonna,

2018
01:56:04,470 --> 01:56:07,200
you're not gonna get to see that
while you're eating beans out of a can

2019
01:56:07,830 --> 01:56:10,710
underneath a bridge. You think
dictators going to be good? No,

2020
01:56:11,400 --> 01:56:12,960
it doesn't look that great.

2021
01:56:12,960 --> 01:56:16,100
It doesn't look good and I keep
hearing it's terrible. Oh really? Yeah.

2022
01:56:16,350 --> 01:56:20,790
Unfortunately I don't have a huge Ali g
fan. This is how hugely allergy fan I am.

2023
01:56:21,030 --> 01:56:26,030
I bought an a different DVD player
because the DVD player that I bought would

2024
01:56:26,161 --> 01:56:31,030
play DVDs from the UK because there's
two different regions and apparently like

2025
01:56:31,080 --> 01:56:34,530
we used to be cheap DVD players
were all region like a cheap one,

2026
01:56:34,531 --> 01:56:38,460
like a really expensive one, but only be,
you could only play American DVDs on it,

2027
01:56:38,610 --> 01:56:39,870
but a cheap one for some reason.

2028
01:56:39,871 --> 01:56:43,380
Some of them they had like all regions
and it eventually they phased that shit

2029
01:56:43,381 --> 01:56:46,320
out. I think, I don't think you can get
all regions anymore. I might be wrong,

2030
01:56:46,410 --> 01:56:47,220
but the point is,

2031
01:56:47,220 --> 01:56:51,750
I bought a special DVD player just for
European videos so I could watch the

2032
01:56:51,751 --> 01:56:55,830
ology show and I got them all off
the Amazon website, the UK, Amazon,

2033
01:56:56,040 --> 01:56:57,840
amazon.co. Dot. UK.

2034
01:56:57,870 --> 01:57:00,480
They have their own version of
Ama and a bunch of different shit,

2035
01:57:00,690 --> 01:57:04,680
like all these allergy episodes that
I never show saw like Ali, Geez movie.

2036
01:57:04,770 --> 01:57:09,770
What was that movie allergy in the House
do that movie is fucking brilliant.

2037
01:57:10,100 --> 01:57:11,610
You and I remember you and I washed it.

2038
01:57:11,760 --> 01:57:16,230
We got banked as fuck and we watch Ali
g in the house and I got this DVD player

2039
01:57:16,231 --> 01:57:20,430
specifically to watch Ali g. But
when I watched that, the ad for that,

2040
01:57:20,580 --> 01:57:23,610
I mean I could be wrong, but I watched the
ad. I was like, Whoa, what happened here?

2041
01:57:23,670 --> 01:57:26,970
Like this looks like a mess.
I see it. There is a chance.

2042
01:57:26,971 --> 01:57:31,120
Like maybe he's holding all the good
stuff to cook because Bruno and Borat,

2043
01:57:31,140 --> 01:57:35,930
we're fucking brilliant. Brilliant. I've
seen Bruno probably a hundred times more.

2044
01:57:35,990 --> 01:57:40,470
Laura was so god damn good. He's so good,
man. He's so hilarious when he's on,

2045
01:57:40,560 --> 01:57:44,790
but you know everybody has fuck ups.
I don't know if this is going to be one,

2046
01:57:44,791 --> 01:57:47,070
but I keep hearing bad
things. Oh really? Yeah.

2047
01:57:47,130 --> 01:57:50,460
I keep hearing they're delaying it and
reshooting things and trying to fix

2048
01:57:50,461 --> 01:57:52,110
things. Damn. I hope. I hope I'm wrong,

2049
01:57:52,140 --> 01:57:55,440
but it could be also that people like
Freddy got fingered. They don't get it.

2050
01:57:55,850 --> 01:57:58,710
You know, like Freddy got fingered.
You and I both agree. It's hilarious.

2051
01:57:58,711 --> 01:58:02,250
So crazy or ridiculous movie,
but a lot of people didn't get it.

2052
01:58:02,251 --> 01:58:04,990
They didn't like it. They didn't
want to go with it. You know?

2053
01:58:04,991 --> 01:58:08,010
It was a trip when we talked about Freddy
got fingered last time I was on the

2054
01:58:08,011 --> 01:58:12,030
show. Tom Green. Mike sent
me a tweet. Oh, that's cool.

2055
01:58:12,070 --> 01:58:15,900
Like Holy Shit. I worshiped Tom
Green back when he was doing,

2056
01:58:16,080 --> 01:58:19,320
when he was doing just the small
time shit on MTV. You ever met him?

2057
01:58:20,250 --> 01:58:24,450
I met him once when you did his shall
at his house in the Hollywood hills.

2058
01:58:24,540 --> 01:58:28,980
That was fun, man. Does he
still do it though? I don't
know. I don't know. I gotta.

2059
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:30,180
I got gotta call that dude.

2060
01:58:30,300 --> 01:58:33,490
I gotta get him on my podcast or go
on his or whatever. I did his too.

2061
01:58:33,550 --> 01:58:36,900
He did want to add Kevin Smith's place,
the smog cast place in Hollywood.

2062
01:58:37,350 --> 01:58:42,010
He's a great guy. He's going to be out
at the Canyon club zone. Yeah man. Ay

2063
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:46,810
all his early shit. I worshiped Tom Green,
you know, he's a loving standup now.

2064
01:58:47,590 --> 01:58:50,420
Really? He's getting into it. He's
a dude. He's a stand up. He's,

2065
01:58:50,490 --> 01:58:53,080
he's just stand up all over the
country. All over the world. Wow. Yeah.

2066
01:58:53,081 --> 01:58:57,400
I've watched videos of him kicking ass
in Australia. You Dude, he's doing great.

2067
01:58:57,630 --> 01:59:00,310
He's doing great. Well he's a funny
guy, man. And he just, you know,

2068
01:59:00,340 --> 01:59:03,930
just for a long time just
didn't do standup and then
he just, I remember talking,

2069
01:59:03,940 --> 01:59:06,250
I was like, I'm really getting into
this now we're getting an understand up.

2070
01:59:06,490 --> 01:59:07,750
Who's really excited about it?
You know,

2071
01:59:07,751 --> 01:59:10,550
it was like something new to him
and it was all his, he could like,

2072
01:59:10,690 --> 01:59:11,523
he had sort of,

2073
01:59:11,530 --> 01:59:14,800
or he was one of the first guys to really
branch out on the Internet and do his

2074
01:59:14,801 --> 01:59:18,100
own shit. Yeah. With his show, the
Tom Green showed live on the Internet.

2075
01:59:18,100 --> 01:59:21,370
It was really one of the first guys
and then I think he just decided,

2076
01:59:21,371 --> 01:59:22,204
you know what,
man?

2077
01:59:22,480 --> 01:59:26,260
Why the fuck am I sitting around waiting
for someone to give me a show when I

2078
01:59:26,261 --> 01:59:29,320
know I'm funny. I know I'm weird,
but I'm, what am I going to do?

2079
01:59:29,321 --> 01:59:31,270
I'm going to wait for someone.
We make something happen.

2080
01:59:31,271 --> 01:59:34,590
Let me go make something happen. I love
that. I just loved that he did that.

2081
01:59:34,600 --> 01:59:39,100
I respect that so much school, Tom
Green's to put dog shit on a mic and just,

2082
01:59:39,310 --> 01:59:42,250
just see how people stupid.
We're stupid.

2083
01:59:42,251 --> 01:59:45,920
People were on the street when they see
a camera and a guy come up to him with

2084
01:59:45,921 --> 01:59:49,420
the mic,
they are so thrilled about being on TV.

2085
01:59:49,600 --> 01:59:51,190
They don't want to believe it's bullshit.

2086
01:59:51,490 --> 01:59:53,920
They see the shit right in
front of their face. Literally,

2087
01:59:54,120 --> 01:59:57,550
he'll put dog shit on a mic and start
talking to people and interviewing people

2088
01:59:57,700 --> 01:59:58,690
and they'll smell it.

2089
01:59:58,810 --> 02:00:02,830
They'll look at it and still
continue with the interview,

2090
02:00:02,860 --> 02:00:06,220
hoping, just not even thinking
that they're being goofed on.

2091
02:00:06,221 --> 02:00:07,150
They don't want to believe that shit.

2092
02:00:07,151 --> 02:00:09,670
They want to believe that they're
really on TV and it's real.

2093
02:00:10,090 --> 02:00:12,520
You know the crazy shit.

2094
02:00:12,850 --> 02:00:16,210
He was an innovator as far as
doing like really ridiculous shit.

2095
02:00:16,211 --> 02:00:19,640
He was very original with his,
his whole show.

2096
02:00:19,720 --> 02:00:22,690
Fucking that dead Moose on the
side of the highway pulls over.

2097
02:00:23,170 --> 02:00:26,320
I swear he was ridiculous and
over and a nice fucking guy, man.

2098
02:00:26,350 --> 02:00:29,970
Tom Green is a nice fucking guy.
I always enjoyed being around that guy.

2099
02:00:29,990 --> 02:00:32,740
He's just a really good dude to be around.
He's fun.

2100
02:00:33,220 --> 02:00:36,850
And then this world of Weirdos that
you meet, you know you can meet some,

2101
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:42,120
some people that are famous that are just
fucking crazy or weird or nuts or too

2102
02:00:42,341 --> 02:00:46,120
much or you can't take them or the
two too egocentric or whatever.

2103
02:00:46,330 --> 02:00:48,930
It's nice when you meet a guy
like Everlast. You might nice,

2104
02:00:48,931 --> 02:00:52,180
nicely meet a guy who could just hang out.
He's just a regular dude man.

2105
02:00:52,450 --> 02:00:57,160
Or a guy like Tom Green. It's just
a regular dude, you know? So we're,

2106
02:00:57,370 --> 02:01:02,370
we're so lucky being exposed out here
and especially doing like a podcast,

2107
02:01:02,890 --> 02:01:05,920
you're exposed to so many
really extraordinary people.

2108
02:01:06,070 --> 02:01:08,410
So many interesting people.
We think of all the,

2109
02:01:08,800 --> 02:01:12,220
I mean from the fringe to out
from Alex Jones, you know,

2110
02:01:12,520 --> 02:01:16,790
fascinating to got to Michael Rupert, you
know, fascinating God. Alex Jones on the,

2111
02:01:16,791 --> 02:01:19,150
on this podcast. But we're going
to work it out because there was a,

2112
02:01:19,151 --> 02:01:21,970
there was a mistake and I
actually, oh, Alex and apology.

2113
02:01:22,030 --> 02:01:27,030
There's a company called bent
pixels and bent pixels is there,

2114
02:01:27,521 --> 02:01:32,130
they put ads on people's videos
and Marty, yeah, Marty Cordoba,

2115
02:01:32,360 --> 02:01:37,000
who's a good friend of mine and a good
friend of Dana White's and a great guy.

2116
02:01:37,390 --> 02:01:40,010
And we were working together this on

2117
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:42,620
videos, but unfortunately
some videos were claimed.

2118
02:01:42,830 --> 02:01:44,440
It's not just videos of my standup.

2119
02:01:44,450 --> 02:01:48,350
They have like an algorithm and the
algorithm goes and looks for your name.

2120
02:01:49,550 --> 02:01:51,260
So when it goes out and
looks for your name,

2121
02:01:51,261 --> 02:01:53,510
it doesn't necessarily get
something that you own.

2122
02:01:53,511 --> 02:01:55,640
It could be like Joe Rogan
on the Alex Jones show.

2123
02:01:55,670 --> 02:01:59,930
All this algorithm grabs that thinking
that there's a copyright claim to be made.

2124
02:01:59,931 --> 02:02:01,610
Or You could put an ad on that video.

2125
02:02:01,640 --> 02:02:04,910
Well you can't put it down on the video
because it's me and a guest of Alex

2126
02:02:04,910 --> 02:02:08,330
Jones show. So of course they release it
and it's a mistake and they, you know,

2127
02:02:08,360 --> 02:02:11,810
are trying to correct and apologize for
everything, but it's a sloppy algorithm,

2128
02:02:12,140 --> 02:02:14,690
you know, I'm sure they're upset
about it and there it's unfortunate,

2129
02:02:14,691 --> 02:02:15,890
but they're not trying to rip anybody off.

2130
02:02:15,891 --> 02:02:19,190
And then shortly not trying to
claim copyright from me on stuff.

2131
02:02:19,190 --> 02:02:21,800
That's not my stuff. What they're
trying to do is like, you know,

2132
02:02:21,801 --> 02:02:24,170
there's a lot of people that
put your standup online.

2133
02:02:24,410 --> 02:02:27,110
There's a lot of my videos that are
online and other people's videos as well.

2134
02:02:27,350 --> 02:02:31,040
And there's ads on those videos and these,
these videos on other people's sites.

2135
02:02:31,310 --> 02:02:35,810
So other people are getting like,
like I've clicked on a link of my own.

2136
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:37,460
That was one of my heckler videos.

2137
02:02:37,910 --> 02:02:42,910
And I watched an ad that somebody else
put up on my video and like of me.

2138
02:02:43,430 --> 02:02:45,860
And I'm like, that's hilarious. Like this
guy's making money. And I looked down,

2139
02:02:45,861 --> 02:02:47,960
it was like thousands
and thousands of views.

2140
02:02:47,961 --> 02:02:51,440
I don't have any how many hundred
thousand views, this fucking video guy.

2141
02:02:51,590 --> 02:02:55,040
But I'm like, how crazy is that?
This guy, whatever, and add pays you.

2142
02:02:55,041 --> 02:02:57,500
I don't know what it pays you,
but this guy's making money from my video.

2143
02:02:57,500 --> 02:02:58,590
That's kind of crazy bullshit.

2144
02:02:58,670 --> 02:03:03,370
So when Marty confronted me about it or
confirm or offered me rather this and

2145
02:03:03,440 --> 02:03:06,920
discussed it with me, I
shouldn't say confronted, cause
that sounds like hostile.

2146
02:03:07,220 --> 02:03:10,130
It doesn't confront it presented,
presented the proper word.

2147
02:03:10,370 --> 02:03:15,370
When Marty presented it to me, I certainly
did not have any intention of uh,

2148
02:03:15,390 --> 02:03:17,960
it, you know, connecting
itself to someone else.

2149
02:03:17,961 --> 02:03:19,730
And there's a lot of people
complaining about it,

2150
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:21,950
but most people don't understand
that it's just a mistake.

2151
02:03:21,951 --> 02:03:24,560
It's an algorithm and they're not trying
to be sleazy. They'll fix everything.

2152
02:03:24,561 --> 02:03:26,180
And I'm sorry,
but uh,

2153
02:03:27,050 --> 02:03:30,200
but motherfucker got
bills trying to get paid.

2154
02:03:30,380 --> 02:03:32,390
Trying to keep that money rolling in dog.

2155
02:03:32,900 --> 02:03:36,140
It's hard to make money off the
Internet, right? Yeah. It's hard.

2156
02:03:36,230 --> 02:03:38,890
It's hard to make money off
the Internet. Yeah, their yard.

2157
02:03:38,970 --> 02:03:41,540
So that's the thing
everybody's trying to monetize.

2158
02:03:41,541 --> 02:03:43,460
Like they try to monetize podcasts.

2159
02:03:43,460 --> 02:03:48,140
Like there's ways that people have like
clubs you can join like the VIP program

2160
02:03:48,141 --> 02:03:52,100
and you get a free podcast every week and
extra podcast and a tee shirt and this

2161
02:03:52,101 --> 02:03:52,690
center of that.

2162
02:03:52,690 --> 02:03:56,360
And trying to figure out how you get
someone to spend x amount of money.

2163
02:03:56,690 --> 02:03:58,820
You know,
like a lot of dudes like Kevin Smith,

2164
02:03:58,850 --> 02:04:02,240
they were asking him for a Ad Free Shit.

2165
02:04:02,270 --> 02:04:05,330
Like a lot of people were asking him
for Ad Free Shit. So he decided to make,

2166
02:04:05,570 --> 02:04:08,570
he's got like two versions, like his
regular podcast, completely free,

2167
02:04:08,900 --> 02:04:10,490
but you've got to listen to a few ads,
you know,

2168
02:04:10,491 --> 02:04:14,570
they've got to pay the bills and then he
has a membership offer where you could

2169
02:04:14,571 --> 02:04:18,050
get that and then you get the no
adversion pay like five bucks a month or

2170
02:04:18,070 --> 02:04:20,210
something like that. Yeah, it's
totally reasonable. You know,

2171
02:04:20,211 --> 02:04:22,370
and you'd want to support it
if you really did enjoy it.

2172
02:04:22,370 --> 02:04:24,650
It's not as long as it's like five
bucks a month, you know? It's like,

2173
02:04:24,980 --> 02:04:27,320
like my comedy special that
I'm going to release online,

2174
02:04:27,321 --> 02:04:29,810
that's going to be five bucks and
it has to be five or first of all,

2175
02:04:29,811 --> 02:04:33,500
cause Louis C k the first guy to do
it and make this a popular choice.

2176
02:04:33,740 --> 02:04:38,010
He charged five bucks. So you can't
charge more than the innovator. You know,

2177
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:40,470
he's completely fair in
the right way to do it.

2178
02:04:40,500 --> 02:04:42,750
He did it perfect and you've
got to follow his lead.

2179
02:04:42,990 --> 02:04:46,080
You shouldn't charge any more than that.
So I think,

2180
02:04:46,180 --> 02:04:50,730
I think there's nothing wrong with what
you know anybody's doing by asking for

2181
02:04:50,731 --> 02:04:55,290
some sort of a membership fee to just to,
just to work off some of the bills.

2182
02:04:55,590 --> 02:04:55,741
You know,

2183
02:04:55,741 --> 02:04:59,310
there's a lot of people that would be
happy to pay five bucks to listen to Adam

2184
02:04:59,310 --> 02:05:01,530
Carolla every month. I mean,
it's a part of their daily grind.

2185
02:05:01,950 --> 02:05:05,640
I mean for what costs? A couple cups
of coffee a month, you know? I mean,

2186
02:05:05,641 --> 02:05:08,340
I don't know how much he charges,
but Adam has some sort of a Ustream thing,

2187
02:05:08,610 --> 02:05:11,130
but for a lot of people, man,
they fucking love that show.

2188
02:05:11,131 --> 02:05:14,220
Adam Carolla show is super
fucking popular. That's a,

2189
02:05:14,221 --> 02:05:16,260
he's a big part of a
lot of people's lives.

2190
02:05:16,500 --> 02:05:18,150
This is not wrong as
long as it's reasonable.

2191
02:05:18,420 --> 02:05:22,350
The beautiful thing is that it can be
reasonable like five bucks and because of

2192
02:05:22,351 --> 02:05:26,820
the Internet it really could benefit the
artists like you, like you know your,

2193
02:05:26,821 --> 02:05:30,570
your Jujitsu website, five bucks benefits
you man, it goes right to you. You know?

2194
02:05:30,571 --> 02:05:33,690
Whereas me, when I'm selling it five
bucks benefit, it goes right to me.

2195
02:05:33,840 --> 02:05:37,140
It's not like the old days where
you had to go through some sort of a

2196
02:05:37,141 --> 02:05:38,280
manufacturing company.

2197
02:05:38,280 --> 02:05:40,860
He would put the DVD together
for you in a marketing company.

2198
02:05:40,861 --> 02:05:44,370
He would put it on the shelves and talk
to where we got Jean at Walmart and you

2199
02:05:44,371 --> 02:05:46,290
know, you had to get in and
all these different places.

2200
02:05:46,410 --> 02:05:49,230
This was just a couple of years ago,
man, just a couple of years ago,

2201
02:05:49,231 --> 02:05:53,040
one of my last DVD deals that I did, I
remember, you know, one of the big things,

2202
02:05:53,041 --> 02:05:58,041
I had to go and sit and I had a a meeting
with these dudes that are this big DVD

2203
02:05:58,501 --> 02:06:01,680
distribution company and they were
pitching to me how they can get my DVD and

2204
02:06:01,681 --> 02:06:05,100
all these different stores all over the
country and this is what's important.

2205
02:06:05,101 --> 02:06:05,811
What's important is,
you know,

2206
02:06:05,811 --> 02:06:08,040
you can't have anything on the
shelves and can't get onto Walmart.

2207
02:06:08,220 --> 02:06:10,230
If you can't get in a Walmart,
you're really doomed.

2208
02:06:10,440 --> 02:06:12,780
You're doomed to sell these things.
This is the new reality.

2209
02:06:13,080 --> 02:06:14,460
Like how to get into Walmart,

2210
02:06:14,461 --> 02:06:17,270
so you had to have something
knows he can't like cab call,

2211
02:06:17,430 --> 02:06:20,520
call it like shit talking one on one,
like the name of my message board.

2212
02:06:20,730 --> 02:06:23,550
You can never have a a DVD named
that because they wouldn't sell it.

2213
02:06:24,200 --> 02:06:26,920
It has to be squeaky clean.
There's just a few years ago. Hmm.

2214
02:06:28,100 --> 02:06:29,940
It's fascinating when this is all going,
man.

2215
02:06:30,430 --> 02:06:34,450
Yeah. You don't need any of that shit
anymore. I'm, I'm starting to sell,

2216
02:06:34,570 --> 02:06:37,270
I'm in the process of
switching manufacturers now.

2217
02:06:37,300 --> 02:06:40,090
I'm handling all my merchandise now.
We've got new shirts coming,

2218
02:06:40,130 --> 02:06:44,140
new designs and hoodies,
new rash guards knew, uh,

2219
02:06:44,310 --> 02:06:46,000
short all that's coming.

2220
02:06:46,150 --> 02:06:48,340
It's going to take a little time
because it's really expensive.

2221
02:06:48,341 --> 02:06:52,450
But my store on my website
hasn't been running for,

2222
02:06:52,600 --> 02:06:57,130
since my website went up. I've
been letting melee, uh, uh,

2223
02:06:57,190 --> 02:07:00,150
that fight where handle
all my merchandise. Like,

2224
02:07:00,151 --> 02:07:01,390
is this too much for me
to handle it for awhile?

2225
02:07:01,450 --> 02:07:05,890
But now I'm going to handle everything
and, and um, you know, take over.

2226
02:07:05,920 --> 02:07:08,540
So it's really exciting when we're
talking about this before the podcast,

2227
02:07:08,710 --> 02:07:11,830
it's really exciting to be able to
have a concept like what's going on?

2228
02:07:11,831 --> 02:07:16,510
It's like a 10th planet heads are
designing shirts and I'm like, Oh shit,

2229
02:07:16,540 --> 02:07:19,810
I want that design. I send it over
to my manufacturer. He makes it,

2230
02:07:19,811 --> 02:07:22,660
we make it happen. Sell it on the
website. Boom. Just like that.

2231
02:07:22,661 --> 02:07:26,440
It's on like donkey Kong. It's crazy. It's
crazy. It's a strange world we live in,

2232
02:07:26,441 --> 02:07:27,790
dude. Yeah. So it's like,

2233
02:07:27,970 --> 02:07:32,140
like right now is is a bad time
to buy by 10th planet gear.

2234
02:07:32,141 --> 02:07:36,010
We're just getting it rolling. You
could still, I'm allowing to sell out

2235
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:40,990
all their stuff. Maili you can go to
10th planet gear.com Malay owned that,

2236
02:07:41,310 --> 02:07:44,470
um, until the end of the year they're
allowed to sell everything off and, and,

2237
02:07:44,530 --> 02:07:47,380
and while I build up my own merchandise,
um,

2238
02:07:47,540 --> 02:07:50,530
it's going to be official 10th
planet brand. It's not like an cause.

2239
02:07:50,531 --> 02:07:52,480
It used to be only wants to
learn Jujitsu from your website,

2240
02:07:52,481 --> 02:07:55,450
which is more interesting to most people
here. What, how did, how did they do that?

2241
02:07:55,451 --> 02:07:56,740
If they want to learn Jujitsu online,

2242
02:07:56,741 --> 02:08:00,580
is it possible to just go to a regular
school and like learn all your shit

2243
02:08:00,581 --> 02:08:04,720
online and then go to the school and
just, yeah, you could bring a laptop,

2244
02:08:05,080 --> 02:08:09,100
bring uh, bring an iPhone. Do you have
an iPhone versions of it? Yup. Yup. Um,

2245
02:08:09,250 --> 02:08:11,530
you can watch it on
iPad and all that stuff.

2246
02:08:12,370 --> 02:08:17,370
Basically it's most traditional Brazilian
jujitsu schools have like one or two

2247
02:08:18,521 --> 02:08:21,730
guys that are into temp planet techniques.
And so you could be that guy,

2248
02:08:21,731 --> 02:08:26,290
you could go to a Gracie Baha school
and not jump on my website and for five

2249
02:08:26,291 --> 02:08:29,360
bucks extra, you get to learn all this
stuff that they're not teaching to there.

2250
02:08:29,380 --> 02:08:31,990
Cause most Gracie Barra schools
don't teach rubber guard.

2251
02:08:31,991 --> 02:08:35,560
They don't teach all the stuff
that we saw the Korean Zombie do.

2252
02:08:35,620 --> 02:08:38,290
It's a lot of great schools.
There are a lot of them out there.

2253
02:08:38,350 --> 02:08:41,590
There's a million of them. You know,
there's a credible lunch I have,

2254
02:08:41,650 --> 02:08:43,500
there's only like 30 10 plan in schools.

2255
02:08:43,540 --> 02:08:47,860
There's probably 500 Gracie Bajas
not more theirs. They're everywhere.

2256
02:08:49,330 --> 02:08:53,380
They're huge. It's incredible. How would
you do to, is taken off man. So it's just,

2257
02:08:53,440 --> 02:08:56,620
it's just a testament of what
a fun way it is to exercise.

2258
02:08:56,920 --> 02:08:57,880
So I saw this thing man,

2259
02:08:57,881 --> 02:09:00,130
and I had to talk to you about it
cause it's completely ridiculous.

2260
02:09:01,140 --> 02:09:05,680
Phillip Corso, you know who that dude
is? Yeah. The, uh, the guy who was a,

2261
02:09:05,710 --> 02:09:10,120
he was one of the, well he was one
of the people that supposedly was,

2262
02:09:10,240 --> 02:09:15,100
was there and saw the um,
the, the, the, the spacecraft.

2263
02:09:15,430 --> 02:09:18,940
Wasn't he at Roswell? Yes. He was
one of the actual people. Yes.

2264
02:09:18,970 --> 02:09:23,050
His son or someone want to try
to find the, find the actual,

2265
02:09:24,730 --> 02:09:27,850
the actual article because
someone in his family,

2266
02:09:27,880 --> 02:09:32,620
it was Philip Corso son reveals that
Roswell craft was a time machine.

2267
02:09:34,180 --> 02:09:38,580
Quiet like you crazy. Motherfucker
did. Anything's possible though.

2268
02:09:38,670 --> 02:09:43,270
I know anything's possible. That's crazy.
I mean it is crazy. It is crazy. Yeah.

2269
02:09:43,271 --> 02:09:48,190
But reality is crazy. It is real thing as
possible. Shit. Who knows like the truth,

2270
02:09:48,540 --> 02:09:53,410
like the tea. But I love these things
because these, these revelations,

2271
02:09:53,470 --> 02:09:57,280
they're always in like some
weird hotel conference room.

2272
02:09:57,400 --> 02:10:01,900
There's like a podium and this is
like a bad slide show. This is,

2273
02:10:02,590 --> 02:10:05,080
you know, not, not quite fascinating.

2274
02:10:05,260 --> 02:10:08,750
And this guy talking about it,

2275
02:10:08,980 --> 02:10:13,540
he's talking about how the, it's the,
in the presentation, I'll just read it.

2276
02:10:13,541 --> 02:10:14,620
It says the details,

2277
02:10:14,621 --> 02:10:18,400
the alleged Roswell craft or talked
about at length a particular interest was

2278
02:10:18,401 --> 02:10:22,900
information about the so called
extraterrestrial biological entities,

2279
02:10:22,901 --> 02:10:24,640
which contained two brains.

2280
02:10:24,790 --> 02:10:28,990
One was organic and thought to control
the beings and the other one was laced

2281
02:10:28,991 --> 02:10:30,850
with crystal electronics.

2282
02:10:31,360 --> 02:10:34,130
That's still not understood to
this day was thought to connect

2283
02:10:34,130 --> 02:10:36,470
the beings with the craft through time.

2284
02:10:36,790 --> 02:10:40,820
It is purported that these beings are
essentially artificial intelligence from

2285
02:10:40,821 --> 02:10:45,821
our own future and that their crash
caused a bifurcation of our timelines and

2286
02:10:46,761 --> 02:10:47,870
altered our history.

2287
02:10:48,200 --> 02:10:52,280
The most mind boggling aspect of this
story and the theory that the air force,

2288
02:10:52,281 --> 02:10:57,281
et Cetera are operating under is that as
a result of this timeline split and the

2289
02:10:57,651 --> 02:11:02,490
subsequent advancement in technology
from reverse engineering that we are the

2290
02:11:02,491 --> 02:11:06,800
military are now on a
timeline of technological
evolution that will eventually

2291
02:11:06,801 --> 02:11:11,801
create the very same craft and beings
that actually crashed in Roswell in 1947

2292
02:11:12,710 --> 02:11:16,880
whoa. That's an insane shit you
imagine. That's incredible. I mean,

2293
02:11:17,180 --> 02:11:20,990
it sounds completely ridiculous and I'm
sure this guy's nuts out of his fucking

2294
02:11:20,991 --> 02:11:23,030
head. But if he wasn't, just just say,

2295
02:11:23,090 --> 02:11:26,780
let's just say two to settle out all the
skeptics and the people that would be

2296
02:11:26,781 --> 02:11:30,200
critical of this idea. Imagine if
that is how it works. I mean, we're,

2297
02:11:30,201 --> 02:11:33,140
we're working so hard right
now, not we, not yet, not I,

2298
02:11:33,170 --> 02:11:36,590
but scientists are to figure out all
kinds of crazy things that are going to

2299
02:11:36,591 --> 02:11:39,020
alter the very way we
interact with the universe.

2300
02:11:39,170 --> 02:11:41,920
Look what the fuck's going on with
this large Hadron collider. Yeah.

2301
02:11:41,930 --> 02:11:46,930
Look at this cork gluon
plasma that they've created
that's like the most dense,

2302
02:11:46,941 --> 02:11:48,890
thick,
like it's some insane amount.

2303
02:11:48,891 --> 02:11:52,700
Like a sugar cube weighs like 40 billion
pounds or something crazy. I mean,

2304
02:11:52,701 --> 02:11:56,180
they're doing some nutty, nutty shit
are working on a time machine right now.

2305
02:11:56,181 --> 02:12:00,200
I think they could send photons back
like seconds at a time or something like

2306
02:12:00,201 --> 02:12:02,720
that. But they have been
working on it for 20 years.

2307
02:12:02,721 --> 02:12:05,960
I mean a time machine is something
that they're actually working on their

2308
02:12:05,961 --> 02:12:07,820
scientists working on it. The, you know,

2309
02:12:07,821 --> 02:12:11,500
they're going to start with photons
and maybe five minutes in the future,

2310
02:12:11,520 --> 02:12:16,340
whatever they know, time travel is
possible. Einstein said it was possible.

2311
02:12:16,520 --> 02:12:19,970
I mean, based on the speed
Kurt Godel who came up with it,

2312
02:12:19,971 --> 02:12:22,670
I remember reading about it who's
a mathematician, but it needed,

2313
02:12:22,880 --> 02:12:26,480
you needed something like an object the
size of the solar system and it had to

2314
02:12:26,481 --> 02:12:30,360
be going backwards fucking faster
than the speed of light. It's this,

2315
02:12:30,380 --> 02:12:32,580
there's like a lot of weird shit that
happened with the speed of light,

2316
02:12:32,581 --> 02:12:34,140
something the transverse its axle.

2317
02:12:34,550 --> 02:12:39,550
If you travel out in space at the speed
of light and then like for you know,

2318
02:12:40,050 --> 02:12:44,450
uh, uh, a week and then come back at the
speed of life broke, something like that,

2319
02:12:44,451 --> 02:12:49,451
that you're going to cut back to a
planet that's like 500 years older,

2320
02:12:49,520 --> 02:12:52,680
older. Yeah. Yeah. That is
weird and crazy. Is that, yeah,

2321
02:12:53,020 --> 02:12:57,470
that's relative to how fast you're
traveling. Anything. Anything's possible.

2322
02:12:57,590 --> 02:12:59,690
It's all nuts, right? Isn't
it? But check this out.

2323
02:12:59,691 --> 02:13:02,510
But it's just that I was right though.
We're going to call me a cook,

2324
02:13:02,780 --> 02:13:07,030
but I just wanted to play this as really
quick evidence. This is evidence, this,

2325
02:13:07,040 --> 02:13:07,873
just listen to it.

2326
02:13:08,040 --> 02:13:11,580
There's a lot of genealogical research,
you know, going back, Dick's family,

2327
02:13:11,581 --> 02:13:15,960
my family, they said, well, we can
amazing tales of people who went west,

2328
02:13:16,380 --> 02:13:19,980
but one of the things I discovered is
that Dick and Barack Obama or eight

2329
02:13:19,981 --> 02:13:21,420
cousins,
why is that?

2330
02:13:21,421 --> 02:13:25,380
An amazing thing is if you go back
eight generations common ancestor,

2331
02:13:25,860 --> 02:13:27,100
these spiritual beings,

2332
02:13:29,030 --> 02:13:33,110
that's it. I mean, well there's, that's
when that article we read, right?

2333
02:13:33,900 --> 02:13:38,130
Dick Cheney's wife. That bench is probably
crazy. She's living with Dick Cheney.

2334
02:13:38,970 --> 02:13:40,320
She must be a devil worshiper.

2335
02:13:42,180 --> 02:13:44,940
Could you imagine if dictate he was your
husband? Well, what do you think, honey?

2336
02:13:44,941 --> 02:13:49,350
Did I do the right thing? Yeah, whatever.
1 million people dead. Whatever.

2337
02:13:49,800 --> 02:13:53,910
We've got a nice house then I'll
fucking bad ass out when it go. Dude,

2338
02:13:54,180 --> 02:13:56,190
you provided he provided for your family.

2339
02:13:58,880 --> 02:14:01,410
Let's see that kind of like
stick let's Dick Cheney fogger.

2340
02:14:01,560 --> 02:14:06,400
Do you think he wears like an old
mask? A her cape, like he's one of the,

2341
02:14:06,450 --> 02:14:09,150
the watchmen. Is that what they
were? What the fuck is that?

2342
02:14:10,470 --> 02:14:11,303
What are you doing dude?

2343
02:14:11,610 --> 02:14:14,250
I was just started trying to apply no
bond and have a conversation by myself.

2344
02:14:14,280 --> 02:14:15,200
I was just trying to find out.

2345
02:14:15,600 --> 02:14:18,680
You get on that on your laptop sometimes
and ignoring me and I'm left the first

2346
02:14:18,890 --> 02:14:21,780
laptop on a fucking island only
for a second to Google something.

2347
02:14:21,990 --> 02:14:25,110
That's what I was trying to out trying
to find the Obama interview of him

2348
02:14:25,111 --> 02:14:29,010
talking about it. Oh, I don't, I don't
really care if they all are related.

2349
02:14:29,011 --> 02:14:31,750
They all suck about that.
They're related, but yeah,

2350
02:14:32,050 --> 02:14:35,610
but if they are all related,
fuck, what does that mean?

2351
02:14:36,330 --> 02:14:39,990
It means it means that we're living in a,
this is all bullshit.

2352
02:14:39,991 --> 02:14:43,590
Maybe we are living in some
sort of a manufactured reality.

2353
02:14:44,040 --> 02:14:47,190
I had been thinking that more and more
lately as things get weirder and weirder.

2354
02:14:47,550 --> 02:14:47,761
You know,

2355
02:14:47,761 --> 02:14:51,210
when that Joseph Kony guy and the guy
who had the campaign against Joseph Kony

2356
02:14:51,420 --> 02:14:52,960
and then a few days later he,

2357
02:14:53,130 --> 02:14:55,710
they made like fucking insane
amounts of money and they,

2358
02:14:55,860 --> 02:14:58,800
the way they had their sponsorship
or their charity rather set up,

2359
02:14:58,801 --> 02:14:59,820
it was really fucked up.

2360
02:14:59,821 --> 02:15:03,690
Like they got a lot of money out of it
before the money actually got to anybody

2361
02:15:03,691 --> 02:15:07,200
that was, you know, overseas, you know,
it was, it was really kind of a scam.

2362
02:15:07,470 --> 02:15:11,580
But then the guy went crazy and wound
up masturbating in the street and San

2363
02:15:11,580 --> 02:15:14,460
Diego and acting really gay and
it flailing his arms around it,

2364
02:15:14,461 --> 02:15:17,250
talking really gay and they arrested him.
He went crazy.

2365
02:15:17,490 --> 02:15:19,410
But it's almost like you see
something like that happen.

2366
02:15:19,530 --> 02:15:23,880
You see a guy get shamed because
people find out that his, his uh,

2367
02:15:24,300 --> 02:15:26,850
his charity was like a little funky,

2368
02:15:26,851 --> 02:15:29,250
a little suspicious and then
he winds up blown a gas.

2369
02:15:29,251 --> 02:15:32,340
But like as gasket like that publicly,
it almost makes you feel like,

2370
02:15:32,341 --> 02:15:36,750
who's writing this? This is, this
is like, this is a work of fiction.

2371
02:15:37,080 --> 02:15:37,913
Who's right,
who is,

2372
02:15:38,100 --> 02:15:42,600
who's writing the thing where that
wiener guy gets arrested for showing his

2373
02:15:42,601 --> 02:15:46,430
wiener, who's writing this? You
know who's writing it? Who's when?

2374
02:15:46,431 --> 02:15:50,800
When you see a guy like Mitt Romney and
Mitt Romney talked to that kid who was a

2375
02:15:50,820 --> 02:15:54,600
medical marijuana patient who was like,
you gonna arrest me. Am I a criminal?

2376
02:15:54,601 --> 02:15:56,730
Like this is the only thing
that allows me to eat well.

2377
02:15:56,731 --> 02:15:58,950
I'm not for medical marijuana.
I'm not for it.

2378
02:15:58,980 --> 02:16:02,430
And he just walks away from some poor
crippled kid and you're like, really?

2379
02:16:02,500 --> 02:16:06,300
You think that this guy has the kind of
compassion that you want as a man who

2380
02:16:06,301 --> 02:16:10,470
runs the world? That's a fucking
robot. That's an ideological robot.

2381
02:16:10,530 --> 02:16:13,260
That's a guy who's not addressing
a person who is in pain.

2382
02:16:13,261 --> 02:16:17,910
A person who's just been dealt a terrible
hand by life and is telling him that

2383
02:16:17,911 --> 02:16:22,710
there's a substance that gives me a
very unfortunate person, some relief.

2384
02:16:23,120 --> 02:16:25,290
Oh, I'm not for that.
I'm not for your relief.

2385
02:16:25,291 --> 02:16:28,680
I'm an Iud of empire and
I can't see the day light.

2386
02:16:28,800 --> 02:16:33,010
Did you see that video of Mitt Romney
and Obama agreeing on everything?

2387
02:16:33,011 --> 02:16:36,520
It's all spliced together and they
go through every issue, every issue.

2388
02:16:36,670 --> 02:16:39,940
I may agree on every issue,
most issues,

2389
02:16:40,030 --> 02:16:44,830
most issues like a good like 90% of all
the all the big issues and there's video.

2390
02:16:44,920 --> 02:16:47,170
You can find this on you to video
of them going back and forth.

2391
02:16:47,171 --> 02:16:50,920
They're talking and they're saying the
exact same thing and not healthcare.

2392
02:16:51,040 --> 02:16:53,620
The exact same thing about everything.
It's amazing.

2393
02:16:53,621 --> 02:16:57,940
At the end of the day when you realize
how much corporations and big money

2394
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:01,900
influence government and
then once you realize that,

2395
02:17:01,930 --> 02:17:05,860
then you will put it together and
you realize this is a shell game.

2396
02:17:06,310 --> 02:17:10,480
The corporation's influenced both sides.
They just keep this stupid banter going,

2397
02:17:10,481 --> 02:17:13,080
that's a stupid tennis game
or this has got the ball.

2398
02:17:13,110 --> 02:17:16,120
Now that guy has got the ball and
this guy's got the ball and they just

2399
02:17:16,121 --> 02:17:19,480
alternate between Democrats and
Republicans and it mo money,

2400
02:17:19,481 --> 02:17:22,110
Mo problems that Democrats
are there on specifics,

2401
02:17:22,150 --> 02:17:26,200
line of problems like sticking their
and chicks miles and all kinds of freaky

2402
02:17:26,201 --> 02:17:29,380
Shit to Clinton did and then the
Republicans got their issues too and

2403
02:17:29,381 --> 02:17:32,560
everybody's got their own little thing.
It's a back and forth. Well, gay marriage.

2404
02:17:32,561 --> 02:17:34,020
I'm not for gay man.
What about abortion?

2405
02:17:34,040 --> 02:17:37,180
I think of the six months is a little
with a word of it's rape and they keep

2406
02:17:37,181 --> 02:17:38,470
this fucking battle.
Meanwhile,

2407
02:17:38,471 --> 02:17:41,680
they just pulling money out
of other spots of the world,

2408
02:17:41,681 --> 02:17:46,190
just fucking attacking thing in
the world. It's amazing. I mean if,

2409
02:17:46,340 --> 02:17:50,920
if you really look at the actual
game, how it is played, the game of,

2410
02:17:50,921 --> 02:17:53,050
of capitalism, the game of, you know,

2411
02:17:53,051 --> 02:17:57,250
global imperialist capitalism that we're
experiencing right now live in here in

2412
02:17:57,251 --> 02:18:00,070
America and the balls of the
Dick that's fucking the world.

2413
02:18:00,190 --> 02:18:03,280
If you really look at it, it really
is an amazing God. That movie.

2414
02:18:03,281 --> 02:18:06,810
It feels like someone wrote this shit
down. Yeah. It feels like dark city. Yeah.

2415
02:18:06,830 --> 02:18:08,110
As as much as I,

2416
02:18:09,040 --> 02:18:13,360
I really am obsessed with just,

2417
02:18:13,510 --> 02:18:17,140
I mean I'm not trying to put together a
revolution or an army or anything like

2418
02:18:17,141 --> 02:18:18,050
that.
All I'm,

2419
02:18:18,110 --> 02:18:23,080
all I'm doing is I'm trying to make
as many people aware as possible.

2420
02:18:23,230 --> 02:18:27,280
Let's not make it that easy for them
to fuck us. I'm not going to style it.

2421
02:18:27,390 --> 02:18:30,220
You know what asked way to influence them.
This is what I always say.

2422
02:18:30,340 --> 02:18:32,950
You're not going to get those
Dick Cheney motherfuckers.

2423
02:18:33,040 --> 02:18:36,370
Those guys are broken that he's
been broken since he was a child.

2424
02:18:36,400 --> 02:18:40,060
What you're going to get is those kids
in college that are listening to this and

2425
02:18:40,061 --> 02:18:42,130
they're realizing, realizing,
you know these guys,

2426
02:18:42,131 --> 02:18:45,970
you know they're in their forties or
telling them about life and and they're

2427
02:18:45,971 --> 02:18:48,640
telling them about it in a very honest
way and letting them know, listen man,

2428
02:18:48,820 --> 02:18:53,200
you are not going to live forever and
the only way you're going to enjoy this

2429
02:18:53,201 --> 02:18:56,680
life is if you create
less negative energy.

2430
02:18:56,860 --> 02:18:58,210
Then you receive from life.

2431
02:18:58,300 --> 02:19:03,300
If you put forth a positive result and
a positive influence and in a positive

2432
02:19:03,520 --> 02:19:05,470
reaction to you being on this planet,

2433
02:19:05,500 --> 02:19:07,000
that's how you're going
to have a good life.

2434
02:19:07,240 --> 02:19:10,150
You are not going to have a good
life. If it's just me, me, me,

2435
02:19:10,180 --> 02:19:13,930
[inaudible] taking over the world
fucking over everybody you're going to,

2436
02:19:14,230 --> 02:19:18,910
after awhile you don't realize how
much money you have. Once you know,

2437
02:19:18,911 --> 02:19:23,200
why would you want $100 million when you
could be happy and comfortable with 10

2438
02:19:23,201 --> 02:19:26,680
or 20 and not have to fuck over the
world where they don't even realize it.

2439
02:19:26,681 --> 02:19:28,610
They're just caught up in
this fucking crazy game.

2440
02:19:28,820 --> 02:19:32,930
You know where a person is
super successful and they
made $100 million fucking

2441
02:19:32,931 --> 02:19:33,650
over the world.

2442
02:19:33,650 --> 02:19:37,350
They probably could have made 30 or $40
million had done it the right way and

2443
02:19:37,351 --> 02:19:39,980
still been just equally as wealthy.

2444
02:19:40,070 --> 02:19:42,860
You don't realize $100
million or $50 million,

2445
02:19:42,861 --> 02:19:45,050
he's crazy assholes that
want to own everything.

2446
02:19:45,170 --> 02:19:46,790
You know what you realize
when you don't have enough.

2447
02:19:46,820 --> 02:19:49,940
You can't afford a good dinner.
You can't afford to heat your house.

2448
02:19:49,940 --> 02:19:51,730
You can't afford to live in a
nice neighborhood where your,

2449
02:19:51,731 --> 02:19:53,900
your kids are safe and they
play in front of your house.

2450
02:19:53,990 --> 02:19:55,760
You can't afford to pay for cable,

2451
02:19:55,820 --> 02:19:58,130
but once you pay for all
that and you have a nice car,

2452
02:19:58,131 --> 02:19:59,540
you have food on your table,

2453
02:19:59,750 --> 02:20:02,450
it becomes a matter of what are
you trying to get with that money?

2454
02:20:02,750 --> 02:20:05,360
What do you track? Where are you
trying to get your happiness from?

2455
02:20:05,420 --> 02:20:08,180
Because if you try to get your
happiness purely through objects,

2456
02:20:08,300 --> 02:20:11,930
that shit's ridiculous or purely
through monetary accomplishment.

2457
02:20:12,080 --> 02:20:15,380
That's ridiculous. It's a dead
end. It really is a head end.

2458
02:20:15,560 --> 02:20:19,160
The way to change the world is to
let kids know this, let them know,

2459
02:20:19,161 --> 02:20:20,240
don't get on that path.

2460
02:20:20,360 --> 02:20:23,420
You can be a successful
motherfucker and still have ethics.

2461
02:20:23,630 --> 02:20:26,750
You can be a successful person and still
be a good guy and do the right thing.

2462
02:20:26,900 --> 02:20:30,920
You can protect the country from the cons
of the world without being one of the

2463
02:20:30,921 --> 02:20:33,740
cons of the world and that's
where Shit went wrong.

2464
02:20:33,950 --> 02:20:38,480
We became cons to protect ourselves from
cunts and we've been doing it from the,

2465
02:20:38,481 --> 02:20:39,680
from the fucking get go.

2466
02:20:39,860 --> 02:20:44,660
The real problem this country is that
there's a lot of us that aren't like you

2467
02:20:44,661 --> 02:20:48,440
or I, and they're the ones who
are representing us in the world.

2468
02:20:48,560 --> 02:20:50,960
They're the ones who are
making all these decisions.

2469
02:20:50,990 --> 02:20:55,990
They're the ones who are doing all these
fucking crazy backroom deals that make

2470
02:20:56,001 --> 02:20:59,630
all kinds of ridiculous shit. That's
horrible for the economy. Legal.

2471
02:20:59,780 --> 02:21:03,650
Just so a few people can extract millions
of dollars from the system and it

2472
02:21:03,651 --> 02:21:04,940
ain't you and it ain't me man,

2473
02:21:05,210 --> 02:21:07,850
and there's something you said to me
once a long time ago and it really stuck

2474
02:21:07,851 --> 02:21:09,950
with me and it's a very astute point.
You said,

2475
02:21:09,951 --> 02:21:13,040
we were born into a system
that we have no control over.

2476
02:21:13,130 --> 02:21:17,240
We were born into it and to try to fix
it is almost impossible and it really is

2477
02:21:17,241 --> 02:21:20,840
true. We were born into this thing and
we've got no fucking control over it.

2478
02:21:21,170 --> 02:21:23,720
He saved voting it please man.

2479
02:21:23,840 --> 02:21:27,560
You really think that Ron Paul
would be losing as badly. He is.

2480
02:21:27,561 --> 02:21:31,280
He is in a lot of these places.
It's absolute proof of voter fraud.

2481
02:21:31,400 --> 02:21:34,100
When it comes to Ron Paul in
several different districts,

2482
02:21:34,280 --> 02:21:36,650
there's been several
different videos on an online.

2483
02:21:36,651 --> 02:21:40,070
One of them I believe was in Maine
where they committed voter fraud.

2484
02:21:40,071 --> 02:21:44,690
Man there they don't want Ron Paul winning
anything nobody does across the board.

2485
02:21:45,470 --> 02:21:49,550
The real reality of our system is that
it's designed to make sure everyone

2486
02:21:49,551 --> 02:21:52,720
doesn't have a say. It's not
that everyone has a say. It's an,

2487
02:21:52,780 --> 02:21:56,420
everyone has a say in who has
a say about who has a say.

2488
02:21:56,810 --> 02:21:59,630
And because of that it's a tiered effect.
They able to control it.

2489
02:21:59,631 --> 02:22:02,840
They block it off at certain ends.
You don't really vote for president,

2490
02:22:02,841 --> 02:22:05,120
you've over representative the
representative votes for president.

2491
02:22:05,270 --> 02:22:07,850
There's all these special interest groups
that are funding these politicians and

2492
02:22:07,851 --> 02:22:11,120
money's coming from fucking soap
manufacturers and want to keep pouring a

2493
02:22:11,121 --> 02:22:14,990
certain amount of shit every year into
the river and make it okay. You know?

2494
02:22:14,991 --> 02:22:17,120
And so it's a mess, man.
It's a fucking mess.

2495
02:22:17,121 --> 02:22:20,150
And the way to fix it is not what
these guys that are in place,

2496
02:22:20,151 --> 02:22:23,350
it's letting these old
motherfuckers die off and let it in.

2497
02:22:23,351 --> 02:22:26,640
The new people come in letting these
people though the guys who own Google,

2498
02:22:26,820 --> 02:22:30,180
these young motherfuckers that are smart
and figured shit out and just said,

2499
02:22:30,181 --> 02:22:34,650
let's just take over everything. Maps,
email, fucking what's make a browser,

2500
02:22:34,770 --> 02:22:37,440
let's make, or an operating system.
Let's make phones. Let's make every,

2501
02:22:37,441 --> 02:22:39,750
let's go crazy. Let's just
get nuts. So let's just,

2502
02:22:39,830 --> 02:22:43,590
I'll control this motherfucker and
do it with a company that's ethical.

2503
02:22:43,591 --> 02:22:45,390
And do it with a company
that's nice to their employees,

2504
02:22:45,540 --> 02:22:48,870
do with a company that gives him a big
cafeteria and takes care of everybody.

2505
02:22:49,320 --> 02:22:49,840
You know,

2506
02:22:49,840 --> 02:22:53,860
it's nice to know that there's good
people out there like anonymous. Yes.

2507
02:22:54,160 --> 02:22:55,420
I mean look,

2508
02:22:55,421 --> 02:22:59,500
I mean we have a force out there who knows
how strong they really are. You know,

2509
02:22:59,501 --> 02:23:01,360
cause I hear from people that,
Oh yeah,

2510
02:23:01,361 --> 02:23:04,600
they're shutting down government websites
that the government don't even care

2511
02:23:04,601 --> 02:23:08,530
about, you know, but I don't really know.
Yeah, that's, that's what I've heard.

2512
02:23:08,560 --> 02:23:11,410
Government cares. The government does
not want you shutting anything down.

2513
02:23:12,160 --> 02:23:15,100
The guy that told the guy that
told me that he was actually a, um,

2514
02:23:15,670 --> 02:23:19,540
a friend of the comedian,
the Indian comedian,

2515
02:23:19,541 --> 02:23:22,030
Peter's Russell Peters computers.
He was a friend of his,

2516
02:23:22,060 --> 02:23:24,610
when he did the podcast and he had this,

2517
02:23:25,060 --> 02:23:27,100
I don't know who he is or
what his name was, but he was,

2518
02:23:27,190 --> 02:23:30,050
that's what he was saying.
He seemed to be, uh,

2519
02:23:30,340 --> 02:23:32,590
an expert on the whole anonymous thing.

2520
02:23:32,591 --> 02:23:37,360
And he said that they're shutting down
websites that really no one cares about,

2521
02:23:37,361 --> 02:23:42,361
but the perception that they have power
is actually giving them the power cause

2522
02:23:42,851 --> 02:23:45,310
then people rallied behind them
and, and, and that kind of, right.

2523
02:23:45,340 --> 02:23:48,580
So it says it's a good thing that you
know, even though they're shutting down,

2524
02:23:48,581 --> 02:23:51,940
like, like you know, an FBI website
that's just like a home page or something,

2525
02:23:52,300 --> 02:23:55,570
I'm not sure exactly what they're doing,
but the perception that they are power,

2526
02:23:55,571 --> 02:23:58,180
we're actually give them power.
Right. Because if everybody,

2527
02:23:58,390 --> 02:24:02,440
everybody in this country decided to look
at the government and look at all the

2528
02:24:02,441 --> 02:24:07,060
shady shit that's going on. Un UN,
UN unbiased way like a detective.

2529
02:24:07,090 --> 02:24:11,230
If everyone just decided to look at all
the evidence and clear their mind and

2530
02:24:11,231 --> 02:24:15,430
have an open mind, man, I think the
power will be shifted back to the people.

2531
02:24:15,490 --> 02:24:18,530
I think it's just, it's so
many people like the, the,

2532
02:24:18,531 --> 02:24:22,770
the propaganda hours ever really been
in the people. You don't have a strong,

2533
02:24:22,940 --> 02:24:27,340
how would I propagandists. Yeah. Just
the fact that that Mitt Romney is,

2534
02:24:27,700 --> 02:24:32,050
is as the best candidate that
the Republicans can come up with.

2535
02:24:32,170 --> 02:24:34,720
That alone tells you there's some shit.

2536
02:24:34,850 --> 02:24:38,300
Well, you first of all, for to be a
representative to be a president. Okay.

2537
02:24:38,301 --> 02:24:40,180
We've already established pretty much it.

2538
02:24:40,190 --> 02:24:42,050
That's just a figurehead with George Bush.

2539
02:24:42,051 --> 02:24:44,120
We sort of establish that he
wasn't really the president.

2540
02:24:44,270 --> 02:24:47,000
He was the guy that's in that position
and they've, you know, whatever,

2541
02:24:47,150 --> 02:24:49,550
for vote him in whatever.
However he got there,

2542
02:24:49,700 --> 02:24:53,630
he got there and then everything behind
the scenes was obviously working without

2543
02:24:53,631 --> 02:24:55,250
him.
The Dick Cheney situation,

2544
02:24:55,251 --> 02:24:58,490
Dick Cheney was the one who was in the
bunker while after all that nine 11 shit

2545
02:24:58,550 --> 02:25:00,290
was going down,
he was the one that was hiding.

2546
02:25:00,440 --> 02:25:03,770
That guy was essentially the mastermind
for the fucking global empire that is

2547
02:25:03,771 --> 02:25:06,140
the United States.
He moved all the pieces in the place,

2548
02:25:06,141 --> 02:25:09,260
made sure a lot of people have profited
and got away with some fucking pretty

2549
02:25:09,261 --> 02:25:12,140
insane shit. So since that's the
case, you got to realize, well,

2550
02:25:12,260 --> 02:25:14,810
in order to be the figurehead, in
order to be the guy, the main guy,

2551
02:25:15,170 --> 02:25:17,510
you can't have a fucked up past.

2552
02:25:17,630 --> 02:25:21,020
You can't have like some Herman Cain type
shit where you got a lot of bitches on

2553
02:25:21,021 --> 02:25:24,010
the side and you're banging them. And
then you know, national enquirer starts

2554
02:25:24,010 --> 02:25:26,410
finding out about shit. You
can't have that anymore. We, we,

2555
02:25:26,411 --> 02:25:30,010
there's too much introspective.
We're, or there's too much work.

2556
02:25:30,011 --> 02:25:31,330
It's too much investigative work.

2557
02:25:31,450 --> 02:25:35,410
They can find out if you did some
shady shit and business in the past,

2558
02:25:35,530 --> 02:25:37,830
they could find out, you
know, if you, you know,

2559
02:25:37,840 --> 02:25:41,350
you fired one of your employees and she
charged with sexual harassment and then

2560
02:25:41,500 --> 02:25:43,300
she's going to tell some
crazy story about, you know,

2561
02:25:43,301 --> 02:25:46,100
you whipped it dick out in the
wash room or something. You know,

2562
02:25:46,120 --> 02:25:49,960
you can't have it. So it leaves
who it leaves. How many people,

2563
02:25:49,961 --> 02:25:53,260
how many people don't have fucking
John David? What's that guy's name?

2564
02:25:53,290 --> 02:25:58,090
Don Davidson. Who? The Guy, the guy that
got arrested, I want to say John Davidson,

2565
02:25:58,091 --> 02:26:01,750
cause he looks like him. The fucking
presidential candidate who got caught.

2566
02:26:02,500 --> 02:26:04,900
He had a a baby with another chick,

2567
02:26:05,140 --> 02:26:09,850
like a girl who was a videographer on
his Toral. Yeah. No, it wasn't Santorum.

2568
02:26:10,110 --> 02:26:14,200
It was. He's in court right now.
Gingrich. You don't even know politicians.

2569
02:26:14,201 --> 02:26:18,430
You don't know anybody do. I know
you'll get grits. Yeah, he's huge. John.

2570
02:26:18,640 --> 02:26:20,920
I want to say John Davidson,
but that's not as fucking name.

2571
02:26:21,040 --> 02:26:23,230
I know she saw someone on Twitter
will tell me what his name is.

2572
02:26:23,770 --> 02:26:25,960
This poor fuck though. He's, he's doomed.

2573
02:26:29,200 --> 02:26:30,490
I don't think in our time,
dude,

2574
02:26:30,491 --> 02:26:34,630
we're going to ever see anybody that
wants to give the power to the people.

2575
02:26:34,900 --> 02:26:39,900
I think we just need a much
more ethical sense of rule,

2576
02:26:41,080 --> 02:26:44,740
you know? I don't think given to power
to the people. It's real tricky man.

2577
02:26:44,920 --> 02:26:48,670
The reason why this whole system is set
up that way is because way back in the

2578
02:26:48,670 --> 02:26:49,660
day,
the founding fathers,

2579
02:26:49,840 --> 02:26:53,290
even though they had a great idea
what this country could be and great

2580
02:26:53,291 --> 02:26:57,400
expectations, they also knew you can't
just completely give power to the people.

2581
02:26:57,610 --> 02:27:00,400
You have to have representatives.
You can't have the mob. Just make,

2582
02:27:00,460 --> 02:27:04,900
and people are too easy and
manipulate. Paid 13, 13 bloodlines,

2583
02:27:04,901 --> 02:27:08,260
13 original states,
13 stars on the flag.

2584
02:27:09,710 --> 02:27:12,040
That's some conspiracy shit.
Like what does the blood,

2585
02:27:12,041 --> 02:27:15,460
there's supposedly 13 royal bloodlines.

2586
02:27:15,760 --> 02:27:20,230
And when John Edwards, thanks.
Kileo Keel, John Edwards,

2587
02:27:20,231 --> 02:27:22,690
the psychic? No, John Edwards.

2588
02:27:23,080 --> 02:27:26,980
Love to spangle I r l two.
Yeah.

2589
02:27:27,040 --> 02:27:30,910
So 13 blood lines. Is that
what it was? Yeah, there's,
there's a connection between,

2590
02:27:30,940 --> 02:27:33,130
uh,
according to the people that have this,

2591
02:27:33,160 --> 02:27:37,830
the bloodline mastered all the way
back to ancient Sumer 13 bloodlines.

2592
02:27:37,840 --> 02:27:39,210
So 13 states.

2593
02:27:39,211 --> 02:27:42,850
It's like they made sure they had someone
from each bloodline and that running

2594
02:27:42,851 --> 02:27:46,150
that state so that it, it stays in
the blood. What stays in the family?

2595
02:27:46,780 --> 02:27:47,471
How could they cut?

2596
02:27:47,471 --> 02:27:52,310
Possibly keep that going all these years
and not have anyone know about it all

2597
02:27:52,350 --> 02:27:54,840
over youtube. Yeah. But that
doesn't mean anything. It's,

2598
02:27:54,880 --> 02:27:58,840
if it hasn't hit CNN yet talking about
it, you know what I mean? Of course.

2599
02:27:58,841 --> 02:27:59,890
It's not,
think about this,

2600
02:28:00,280 --> 02:28:04,270
the propaganda and the brainwashing
that goes on TV is so fucking strong.

2601
02:28:04,271 --> 02:28:08,760
It's so strong that they can
convince most of the people that, uh,

2602
02:28:08,890 --> 02:28:13,650
tower seven fell because of fires that
skyscraper they didn't get hit by plain

2603
02:28:13,850 --> 02:28:17,920
yogurt isn't impossible. I mean, I
don't know shit about architecture.

2604
02:28:18,040 --> 02:28:21,890
Isn't it possible if they've just
did a shit job of that building

2605
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:26,570
somehow another fire which uniformly
spread through the entire building and

2606
02:28:26,571 --> 02:28:30,770
caused like the upper layer to collapse
and then it all simultaneously collapsed.

2607
02:28:30,830 --> 02:28:35,300
No Way, man. 1500 architects
and engineers, professionals,
they called bullshit.

2608
02:28:35,630 --> 02:28:38,450
You look at it. I wonder, I don't even
need to hear the architects of the engine.

2609
02:28:38,451 --> 02:28:41,690
I don't know. I look at that
shit. To me, I'm not that stupid.

2610
02:28:41,870 --> 02:28:43,030
The government is fucking,

2611
02:28:43,070 --> 02:28:46,340
the government's crooked is fuck
history of being crooked as fuck.

2612
02:28:46,850 --> 02:28:47,960
That's a controlled demo.

2613
02:28:47,961 --> 02:28:51,200
I don't need it for people who listen to
this and go shut the fuck up. You guys.

2614
02:28:51,201 --> 02:28:51,830
What are you talking about?

2615
02:28:51,830 --> 02:28:55,310
Well you need to know what was in building
seven cause that's where things get

2616
02:28:55,311 --> 02:28:56,840
rid built again. Again, Bill,

2617
02:28:57,230 --> 02:29:00,500
most people think only two
towers fell because two planes,

2618
02:29:01,120 --> 02:29:05,210
a third tower fell. It.
It not only did it fall,

2619
02:29:05,211 --> 02:29:07,550
but it fell at free fall speed,
like a controlled demo.

2620
02:29:07,640 --> 02:29:09,950
Those things take weeks to load that shit.

2621
02:29:10,070 --> 02:29:15,070
Someone was planning something and all
and tower seven wasn't even next to tower

2622
02:29:15,591 --> 02:29:18,710
one and two there was, well
there was four five, six.

2623
02:29:18,711 --> 02:29:22,940
We're right under it and those got
hit and had massive fires and got hit.

2624
02:29:23,030 --> 02:29:26,720
Not One of those collapsed
but a hundred yards away.

2625
02:29:26,810 --> 02:29:30,980
When I was little fires 47 it
wasn't even next to the twin towers.

2626
02:29:30,981 --> 02:29:35,780
That one fucking get implodes in itself.
How stupid the afterbody collide.

2627
02:29:36,350 --> 02:29:40,100
If you think that if they could and you
know you're looking at a bunch of other

2628
02:29:40,101 --> 02:29:44,330
stuff. They didn't put tower seven in
the nine one one commission report,

2629
02:29:44,570 --> 02:29:46,310
they'd left tower seven out.

2630
02:29:46,400 --> 02:29:51,400
They didn't even explain it
and then people for years
they rallied and like what

2631
02:29:51,830 --> 02:29:53,810
happened at tower seven
what happened at tower?

2632
02:29:53,811 --> 02:29:56,090
So how can we guys aren't
talking about it? Well.

2633
02:29:56,510 --> 02:30:00,950
Then they finally were forced into doing
research on it and they came up with

2634
02:30:01,190 --> 02:30:06,190
the crazy idea that fires made a 47
steel skyscraper collapse all at once.

2635
02:30:09,290 --> 02:30:11,930
And the only way that shit will collapse
all at once, it's all the columns.

2636
02:30:11,931 --> 02:30:16,040
A central columns are blown out at the
same time. How our fire's going to do,

2637
02:30:16,070 --> 02:30:18,180
it's impossible. I don't know. It's not,

2638
02:30:18,340 --> 02:30:20,650
I'm just playing completely
playing devil's advocate.

2639
02:30:20,660 --> 02:30:24,380
If I had a bit on video and, and
it's on video, if it wasn't on video,

2640
02:30:24,470 --> 02:30:27,530
if there wasn't on video and people just,
it was just word of mouth.

2641
02:30:27,620 --> 02:30:30,710
Like there was a tower seven and it fell,
but no one got it on video,

2642
02:30:30,920 --> 02:30:33,320
then it would be, you know,
it'd be like, you know,

2643
02:30:33,321 --> 02:30:34,640
you'd have to really look into it and,

2644
02:30:34,760 --> 02:30:39,620
and really take the word of all these
witnesses. But we have five camera angles.

2645
02:30:39,800 --> 02:30:44,800
We got a good and a
professional professionals
are saying it was a controlled

2646
02:30:45,521 --> 02:30:48,020
demo.
I mean anybody can tell it's a controlled,

2647
02:30:48,350 --> 02:30:51,940
it certainly looks like a controlled
demo and it does literally fall freeze.

2648
02:30:51,941 --> 02:30:56,690
Paul speeds. But what's crazy was
what, what is inside. Like what,

2649
02:30:56,960 --> 02:31:00,920
who had there was CIA offices, uh, Enron.

2650
02:31:00,980 --> 02:31:05,870
All Enron shit was in there.
Um, uh, secret service,

2651
02:31:06,020 --> 02:31:10,940
naval intelligence to me, my guess is
that's where everything was orchestrated.

2652
02:31:11,150 --> 02:31:12,670
That was where to fucking imagine.

2653
02:31:12,710 --> 02:31:15,770
That was where it was orchestrated it
and they go below that motherfucker up.

2654
02:31:15,771 --> 02:31:19,160
No evidence. Can you imagine? Cause he had
to be orchestrated somewhere, somewhere.

2655
02:31:19,170 --> 02:31:20,790
Had someone had to orchestrate that shit.

2656
02:31:21,030 --> 02:31:24,660
It looks like it had to be tower southern
because why would they completely

2657
02:31:24,661 --> 02:31:28,620
destroy it?
Explosions going off everywhere.

2658
02:31:28,621 --> 02:31:31,560
There's all these witnesses,
there's tons of them.

2659
02:31:31,561 --> 02:31:35,940
Same bombs are going off everywhere.
There's a dude who committed suicide and,

2660
02:31:35,941 --> 02:31:40,530
but before he committed suicide, he was,
he was talking about how he put a bomb,

2661
02:31:40,531 --> 02:31:42,990
went off in the elevator
and he dragged the guy out.

2662
02:31:43,050 --> 02:31:45,330
It's a famous interview like right there,
right when it happened.

2663
02:31:45,480 --> 02:31:47,610
And he's talking about how
I just dragged him out, man.

2664
02:31:47,760 --> 02:31:50,940
His face was peeling all he had no
skinny, just a bomb. Just went off.

2665
02:31:50,941 --> 02:31:53,340
Just blew up the whole elevator man.
And this was right when it happened.

2666
02:31:53,341 --> 02:31:55,000
Why would it be bullshit?
He's talking about it.

2667
02:31:55,001 --> 02:31:58,080
It is also possible that something could
have blown up inside because of the

2668
02:31:58,081 --> 02:32:02,580
fire. Just just to say, I mean, just as
a random, but here's what's crazy, man.

2669
02:32:02,850 --> 02:32:06,920
The Larry Silverstein, the guy who
owned building seven or building towers,

2670
02:32:06,980 --> 02:32:09,330
all of them, all of them, he, um,

2671
02:32:09,510 --> 02:32:14,510
he won an $861 million award from
industrial risk insurers to rebuild on the

2672
02:32:15,601 --> 02:32:18,420
side of world tower seven,
because, uh, his, uh,

2673
02:32:18,430 --> 02:32:21,390
estimated investment was only 386 million.

2674
02:32:21,540 --> 02:32:26,350
So he net a profit of roughly $500
million just on that tower. Just on that,

2675
02:32:26,370 --> 02:32:30,590
the third tower that no one talks about
the third tower that no one talks about,

2676
02:32:30,690 --> 02:32:34,860
it's not an official government
dot, uh, Nylon Commission report.

2677
02:32:35,010 --> 02:32:38,760
They left it out. And even,
even those documentaries,

2678
02:32:38,761 --> 02:32:42,810
they try to debunk all the nine one one
shit. They try to debunk everything that,

2679
02:32:42,840 --> 02:32:47,490
uh, that, uh, [inaudible], that's what
they call them, that, uh, bring up,

2680
02:32:47,491 --> 02:32:49,980
but they won't touch tower seven.
They'll have an,

2681
02:32:50,190 --> 02:32:54,030
it was an hour and anything
on national geographic,

2682
02:32:54,240 --> 02:32:55,710
any of those documentaries.

2683
02:32:56,030 --> 02:33:00,690
I firmly believe the CIA has
their hand in those documentaries.

2684
02:33:00,810 --> 02:33:04,480
We know that the CIO has always been
involved in Hollywood and always be that

2685
02:33:04,490 --> 02:33:06,900
involved in TV.
Look up Harry Anslinger,

2686
02:33:06,990 --> 02:33:10,440
the dude who made weedy
legal in 1937 he was in,

2687
02:33:10,530 --> 02:33:12,510
he was the first drugs are,

2688
02:33:12,511 --> 02:33:16,470
he was involved after all the
drug stuff that, that he did.

2689
02:33:16,500 --> 02:33:21,500
He got involved in governing and
supervising Hollywood to make sure there

2690
02:33:21,931 --> 02:33:25,710
weren't any communists in Hollywood
or any pro communist movies.

2691
02:33:25,800 --> 02:33:27,430
This is all documented there.

2692
02:33:27,480 --> 02:33:32,040
CIA had control of Hollywood and you know,
they have their,

2693
02:33:32,170 --> 02:33:36,770
their power in there and I believe this
is like every documentary on that and

2694
02:33:36,780 --> 02:33:40,800
the National Geographic Channel that
goes over a nine one one or any kind of

2695
02:33:40,801 --> 02:33:43,800
conspiracy theory.
The narrators are just,

2696
02:33:43,801 --> 02:33:48,420
they're just making fun of conspiracy
theories there. And conspiracy theorists,

2697
02:33:48,620 --> 02:33:50,240
they think this,
I'm like,

2698
02:33:50,250 --> 02:33:55,250
what kind of show is it's
so it's so biased and they
never cover Tyler seven and

2699
02:33:56,401 --> 02:33:58,080
these shows,
there's a nine one,

2700
02:33:58,081 --> 02:34:03,081
one debunking documentary on
National Geographic that uh,

2701
02:34:04,110 --> 02:34:07,140
they don't cover tower seven.
They'd cover everything else,

2702
02:34:07,141 --> 02:34:09,450
but except tower seven because
they don't have an answer for that.

2703
02:34:09,451 --> 02:34:12,460
They can't prove that shit cause
they can't prove it felt, uh,

2704
02:34:12,660 --> 02:34:17,070
they can't convince anybody. That 47
story skyscrapers, steels, scriber,

2705
02:34:17,350 --> 02:34:21,060
will employ all at once.
All the columns blow on it once from fire,

2706
02:34:21,070 --> 02:34:24,670
check out what was there. Here's a, here's
some of the buildings. Tenants ready?

2707
02:34:24,820 --> 02:34:29,020
Yeah. US Secret Service.
Yes. The NSA, the CIA,

2708
02:34:29,170 --> 02:34:33,790
the IRS, the Bureau of Alcohol,
alcohol, Tobacco and firearms.

2709
02:34:33,910 --> 02:34:38,380
The SEC and AI see securities Salomon,
Smith,

2710
02:34:38,381 --> 02:34:41,530
Barney, Solomon Smith,
Barney, American Express Bank,

2711
02:34:41,560 --> 02:34:46,010
International Standard Charter Bank,
provident financial manager.

2712
02:34:46,011 --> 02:34:49,840
It's all like these fucking big giant
banks and government all together.

2713
02:34:49,841 --> 02:34:53,140
Just a fucking cunt farm.
The stability of honey,

2714
02:34:53,141 --> 02:34:58,060
hive of cunts destroy the
evidence. That's incredible. Right?

2715
02:34:58,061 --> 02:35:01,250
Could you imagine how this turns out?
That's really what happened.

2716
02:35:01,251 --> 02:35:03,650
And then check this out of it.
It was a controlled demo,

2717
02:35:03,651 --> 02:35:07,210
so it must have taken weeks to set up.
So they must like,

2718
02:35:07,270 --> 02:35:09,340
you got to investigate the security.

2719
02:35:09,341 --> 02:35:14,341
Who's running security or guess who's
the head of security and Tyler seven Marv

2720
02:35:14,830 --> 02:35:19,330
Bush. George Bush, his
brother. Come on. Yes, dude.

2721
02:35:19,331 --> 02:35:23,410
Google that. Marv Bush security. Yes. Yes.

2722
02:35:23,500 --> 02:35:27,280
His brother is in charge
of security at Tower Saben.

2723
02:35:27,820 --> 02:35:29,660
Hilarious is that it's pretty cool.

2724
02:35:29,690 --> 02:35:33,640
That doesn't fucking make your bullshit
meter. Just fucking go off the Richter,

2725
02:35:33,670 --> 02:35:38,020
but come on how it does, but it all
seems so, it's like how do you get,

2726
02:35:38,140 --> 02:35:39,130
how do you pass a lie?

2727
02:35:39,160 --> 02:35:42,220
How do you get people to believe a lie
and make it so big they can't not believe

2728
02:35:42,221 --> 02:35:44,370
it. Make it so people
always say this, how good.

2729
02:35:44,800 --> 02:35:47,650
You know how many people who would take
to orchestrate done there would never be

2730
02:35:47,651 --> 02:35:52,300
able to get away with it. Yeah. Yes they
do because they control the media yet.

2731
02:35:52,301 --> 02:35:56,290
How about, and this is on youtube too.
There's on youtube, they're reporting.

2732
02:35:56,291 --> 02:35:58,390
The BBC is reporting.
The tower.

2733
02:35:58,391 --> 02:36:01,570
Seven went collapsed and it's still up.

2734
02:36:02,470 --> 02:36:04,660
Also because they thought
it was going to collapse.

2735
02:36:04,960 --> 02:36:07,660
Apparently there isn't that
kind of fishing. It's like, no.

2736
02:36:07,661 --> 02:36:10,690
You know what that says that says they
already had scripted shit ready to go.

2737
02:36:10,870 --> 02:36:13,150
They already gave him shit.
I already gave him shit.

2738
02:36:13,180 --> 02:36:14,350
Just to play devil's advocate.

2739
02:36:14,351 --> 02:36:17,440
It also could be to the firemen had
said there's some dangerous creaking and

2740
02:36:17,441 --> 02:36:20,740
noises and they think that this building's
going to fall down and it is possible.

2741
02:36:20,770 --> 02:36:25,030
That's our and shit. I ain't maybe
ma'am. I'm not a fucking scientist.

2742
02:36:25,090 --> 02:36:29,220
I don't really know. I know. I know.
I know. As a host of the show you,

2743
02:36:29,260 --> 02:36:32,140
you want to be, you know, you want to
be neutral, you want to be on the fence,

2744
02:36:32,290 --> 02:36:34,840
but you know God damn well that there's,

2745
02:36:35,050 --> 02:36:37,180
that's some bullshit that
went down when I went to one.

2746
02:36:37,181 --> 02:36:40,960
If you look into it unbiased with open
mind, you look at all the evidence,

2747
02:36:40,990 --> 02:36:44,320
just decide to look at all the evidence.
I feel the holy Shit.

2748
02:36:44,440 --> 02:36:49,370
I fell about nine one one very similar
to the way I feel about that Phillip

2749
02:36:49,370 --> 02:36:52,480
Corso son saying it's a time machine.
Come on Elliot.

2750
02:36:52,810 --> 02:36:56,920
It's possible a couple. I don't
know. I don't know man. I don't know.

2751
02:36:56,950 --> 02:36:59,320
If I had to gasp. Very
smart. If I had to guess,

2752
02:36:59,321 --> 02:37:02,640
I would always say I sniff out
bullshit. Very good. Sniff out bullshit.

2753
02:37:02,650 --> 02:37:06,790
Way better than I do, dude. How many
guys have like, you know, over the years,

2754
02:37:06,791 --> 02:37:11,710
like dudes and trying to like, uh, go
into business with me or you for whatever.

2755
02:37:12,140 --> 02:37:14,980
You instantly eagle that guy's
full of shit and I'm like,

2756
02:37:14,990 --> 02:37:17,600
what are you talking about? Your
[inaudible], that guy's full of shit.

2757
02:37:17,650 --> 02:37:19,550
Your bullshit meter is strong,
dude.

2758
02:37:19,551 --> 02:37:23,140
You got one of those high tech alien
fucking bullshit meters from the finish.

2759
02:37:23,150 --> 02:37:24,830
I got a a survival genetic,

2760
02:37:25,160 --> 02:37:28,000
your bullshit meter is going
off on the inside on the novel,

2761
02:37:28,010 --> 02:37:31,110
the nine one one I would see the problem
with that is that's not where I'm,

2762
02:37:31,130 --> 02:37:33,740
where my bullshit meter works best.
My Bill Bullshit,

2763
02:37:34,580 --> 02:37:38,300
my bullshit meter other works best
with people. I need to talk to people.

2764
02:37:38,301 --> 02:37:41,300
If I talk to people, I could see he was
full of shit. Yeah, I could see who's,

2765
02:37:41,540 --> 02:37:45,090
who's hiding something. There's a tick
and insecure aspect to weigh their,

2766
02:37:45,100 --> 02:37:49,280
the way they're interacting.
It's not just modesty or social weirdness.

2767
02:37:49,281 --> 02:37:52,580
I can see deception.
I can see when someone's full of Shit.

2768
02:37:52,581 --> 02:37:57,170
I'm pretty good at that. But this, see,
I don't like fucking with my own head.

2769
02:37:57,230 --> 02:37:58,700
So whenever I look at something like this,

2770
02:37:58,701 --> 02:38:01,010
I have to factor in all
these different things.

2771
02:38:01,210 --> 02:38:03,440
I have to factor in possible incompetence,

2772
02:38:03,650 --> 02:38:07,610
the the need and desire to think that
everything's a conspiracy to the point

2773
02:38:07,611 --> 02:38:11,210
where, like I said, people
have compete convinced, you
know, other people that I am,

2774
02:38:11,211 --> 02:38:14,510
some sort of a government
agent. I've actually read
that, you know, it's hilarious.

2775
02:38:14,520 --> 02:38:17,720
It's fucking absolutely
completely ridiculous.

2776
02:38:17,721 --> 02:38:20,870
But someone will look for a
conspiracy and everything.

2777
02:38:20,930 --> 02:38:23,540
That would be grounds to be,
come on. That would be brilliant.

2778
02:38:23,690 --> 02:38:28,010
And you think about it when they're
like, uh, if you were part of the elite,

2779
02:38:28,040 --> 02:38:30,850
there's a lot of smart mother fuckers,
I'm sure they're brilliant people.

2780
02:38:30,880 --> 02:38:35,880
Part of the elite if you were in charge
of coming up with ways to keep the power

2781
02:38:37,610 --> 02:38:41,390
and to take liberties away and to take
the power from the people, like really?

2782
02:38:41,660 --> 02:38:44,990
I bet. I'm just guessing. The people at
the top, there are people at the time,

2783
02:38:45,230 --> 02:38:50,230
I bet they're really concerned with
keeping their power and however they keep,

2784
02:38:50,751 --> 02:38:53,060
they don't want to lose their power.
Nobody wants to lose their power.

2785
02:38:53,061 --> 02:38:55,530
They want to keep, so whatever
they gotta do to keep their power,

2786
02:38:55,531 --> 02:38:58,010
it's just the human condition.
Anybody that was at the top,

2787
02:38:58,100 --> 02:38:59,960
that'd be a lot of motherfuckers,
just regular people.

2788
02:39:00,020 --> 02:39:02,450
You put them at the top and they'd
be like, maybe we should fucking,

2789
02:39:02,600 --> 02:39:05,660
how do we call them down? Are
you sure that'll work? Okay,

2790
02:39:05,720 --> 02:39:08,390
let's spray the fuckers with chem
trails. Okay, let's do that shit.

2791
02:39:08,530 --> 02:39:13,100
That's a good idea. That's a really, I'd
be a, in the Illuminati boardroom going,

2792
02:39:13,280 --> 02:39:14,091
yeah,
let's spray.

2793
02:39:14,091 --> 02:39:16,500
Motherfuckers don't ever see a come
and they think it's his fucking cloud.

2794
02:39:16,501 --> 02:39:19,760
Just keep making the lines.
No one believes that shit.
You know what I mean? Yeah.

2795
02:39:19,850 --> 02:39:23,040
But we've been caught before
and there's been a treaty,

2796
02:39:23,041 --> 02:39:25,880
a UN treaty in 1977 that we
can't spray the people no more.

2797
02:39:25,881 --> 02:39:30,140
We can't test airborne bacteria on the
people no more. We have to stop. Fuck it.

2798
02:39:30,170 --> 02:39:34,940
Let's just keep doing it. You know what
I mean? And now first it's just, uh, uh,

2799
02:39:35,300 --> 02:39:37,910
first it's just,
just regular contracts now.

2800
02:39:37,911 --> 02:39:42,320
Like all the GL engineering shit's
coming on now. It's like there's a guy,

2801
02:39:42,440 --> 02:39:45,260
there's a guy in a documentary
saying that's just con trails.

2802
02:39:45,261 --> 02:39:46,590
It's not barium and aluminum.

2803
02:39:46,610 --> 02:39:50,840
But in the future we are going to have
to spray barium in aluminum because

2804
02:39:50,841 --> 02:39:53,750
that's going to be the only way to
combat global warming in the future.

2805
02:39:53,751 --> 02:39:57,380
We're going to have to do, but that's not
it right now. Like, dude, what the fuck?

2806
02:39:57,460 --> 02:40:01,730
They're slowly preppiness for
geoengineering protecting the planet.

2807
02:40:01,970 --> 02:40:03,560
You know what I mean?
There's no way.

2808
02:40:03,620 --> 02:40:08,620
There's the military jets flying all over
the world making grids right above us

2809
02:40:10,640 --> 02:40:13,860
and there's no way they're doing
a right above us. And then I,

2810
02:40:13,861 --> 02:40:18,861
you can convince the chem
trails are chemicals and
then it's not just a reaction

2811
02:40:19,021 --> 02:40:22,080
between the moisture in the atmosphere
and the turbines and the jet engines that

2812
02:40:22,081 --> 02:40:26,460
those are contracts.
Con trails disappear within 2030 seconds.

2813
02:40:26,490 --> 02:40:28,680
Are you sure about this stuff?
You really do know.

2814
02:40:28,950 --> 02:40:32,430
How was it possible that they can
just get away with this? They can do,

2815
02:40:32,431 --> 02:40:34,530
they got away with nine one one they
could do anything they want. Yeah,

2816
02:40:34,531 --> 02:40:36,840
but I mean this is what
a regular daily thing,

2817
02:40:36,841 --> 02:40:40,410
right as we were saying over the country
and no one talking all over the world

2818
02:40:40,411 --> 02:40:43,080
except Japan because they're not
part of NATO. So they don't do it.

2819
02:40:43,110 --> 02:40:46,200
There's no camera. Did I get pictures
from all over the world? People,

2820
02:40:46,201 --> 02:40:49,860
you'll see me retweet that shit. People,
people who are and and remember guys,

2821
02:40:49,861 --> 02:40:52,710
you want me to retweet some camp trails?
It can't be just one line dude,

2822
02:40:52,711 --> 02:40:55,010
seven seven send me some alarming shit.
People.

2823
02:40:55,690 --> 02:40:58,680
I retweet a picture of one line.

2824
02:40:58,800 --> 02:41:02,160
People aren't going to believe that's
going to scare people away. So anyways,

2825
02:41:02,161 --> 02:41:06,060
what I'm saying is,
is that for instance,

2826
02:41:06,960 --> 02:41:11,730
there's a military base in
Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, Cuba,

2827
02:41:11,731 --> 02:41:14,910
supposedly our enemies, they
hate us, we hate them, whatever.

2828
02:41:14,910 --> 02:41:17,150
But there's a military
base on that ion of, of,

2829
02:41:17,580 --> 02:41:21,840
of Cuba called Guantanamo
Bay and Americans is do
whatever the fuck they want.

2830
02:41:21,900 --> 02:41:26,370
They, they, they uh, uh, uh,
their ships come in and out.

2831
02:41:26,460 --> 02:41:27,990
No what the Cubans don't
want to fuck with them.

2832
02:41:27,991 --> 02:41:32,100
They want to start a war with these mother
fuckers. Well Jack them and every day.

2833
02:41:32,190 --> 02:41:33,930
Now this is not a conspiracy theory.

2834
02:41:33,931 --> 02:41:38,520
This is on a documentary with one of
the guys in charge, a military officer,

2835
02:41:38,640 --> 02:41:39,090
talkies,

2836
02:41:39,090 --> 02:41:44,090
so against Cuba talking about and bragging
about how every day they dive bomb

2837
02:41:44,550 --> 02:41:47,370
like fighter jets down
into downtown Havana.

2838
02:41:47,580 --> 02:41:50,120
They dive bomb low and
just scare him everyday.

2839
02:41:50,160 --> 02:41:54,330
And he says this on camera and all proud,
like all about waving the flag.

2840
02:41:54,331 --> 02:41:54,840
I'll practice.

2841
02:41:54,840 --> 02:41:58,380
We do that every day because when we
decide to attack them they'll never see it

2842
02:41:58,381 --> 02:41:59,590
coming.
So that's,

2843
02:41:59,640 --> 02:42:04,410
that's an example of classic military
operation like operator operation

2844
02:42:04,411 --> 02:42:09,120
Northwoods. There they have a pattern.
They do sheet over. So to me up and we,

2845
02:42:09,121 --> 02:42:14,010
and we have, we have,
um, ex military, uh, uh,

2846
02:42:14,310 --> 02:42:18,580
air force and marine people
like getting into whether,

2847
02:42:19,090 --> 02:42:21,750
uh, getting on the news,
reporting the weather.

2848
02:42:22,050 --> 02:42:27,050
There's two separate guys that are on
TV and anytime they look at chem trails

2849
02:42:27,240 --> 02:42:29,490
they'll talk about,
well those aren't real clouds.

2850
02:42:29,700 --> 02:42:31,350
I don't know what the
military is doing up there,

2851
02:42:31,351 --> 02:42:35,550
but they're spraying a thing called chaff.
Chaff is aluminum,

2852
02:42:35,910 --> 02:42:39,960
Barium and it's to get a
radar of the whole area.

2853
02:42:40,370 --> 02:42:44,560
So that's proven. Whoa, wait
a minute, it's called chat.

2854
02:42:44,580 --> 02:42:48,030
They're spraying something in the
air so they can get radar. Yes.

2855
02:42:48,031 --> 02:42:50,490
Because of metallic particles,
heart elect.

2856
02:42:50,730 --> 02:42:55,500
So if you just spray a whole area with,
and this is what they do in the military.

2857
02:42:55,501 --> 02:42:57,090
This is not a conspiracy.
That's how they do it.

2858
02:42:57,090 --> 02:43:02,090
In the military they spray aluminum and
Barium to get a radar map and to jam

2859
02:43:02,851 --> 02:43:07,050
radars, they jam radars and to
map out locations as well. Um,

2860
02:43:07,090 --> 02:43:08,280
how many map manpower locations,

2861
02:43:08,281 --> 02:43:12,970
like you could detect the Matarin
were all the metallic particles land,

2862
02:43:13,360 --> 02:43:15,640
you know what I mean?
So they do that already.

2863
02:43:15,700 --> 02:43:17,620
They've been doing that since the fourth.

2864
02:43:17,770 --> 02:43:19,590
They do clouds seat and how do you clouds,

2865
02:43:19,591 --> 02:43:22,640
if you put barium in disguise and all
these tests of all these people are going

2866
02:43:22,670 --> 02:43:23,620
there,
they're spraying,

2867
02:43:23,740 --> 02:43:25,930
all the tests are coming back
with high levels of aluminum,

2868
02:43:26,080 --> 02:43:28,750
high levels of Barium.
And then the myth that's,

2869
02:43:28,830 --> 02:43:32,170
it's just so happens with the
military sprays, it's called,

2870
02:43:32,200 --> 02:43:36,160
they call it chaff in the military.
It's called chaff. And guess what?

2871
02:43:36,161 --> 02:43:38,410
There's fucking,
I don't know why they're doing it,

2872
02:43:38,590 --> 02:43:43,590
but they're spraying chaff over a lot
of major cities in the United States and

2873
02:43:43,781 --> 02:43:46,570
all over the world. All over
England. They're spraying and shop.

2874
02:43:46,750 --> 02:43:49,900
And it can be two things. If I was running
the elite and I said, you know what,

2875
02:43:50,140 --> 02:43:54,700
spray even make it benign just to throw
them up, just spray, put something in in,

2876
02:43:54,730 --> 02:43:58,600
in the, the, the, the, the atmosphere
get, I'm used to all these weird lines.

2877
02:43:58,720 --> 02:44:02,020
Don't put any aluminum, don't put any
barium. Cause once they start testing it,

2878
02:44:02,290 --> 02:44:05,470
they're gonna, you know, they'll
find out that it's totally benign,

2879
02:44:05,560 --> 02:44:08,500
but just get them used to it.
That's what I would do.

2880
02:44:08,530 --> 02:44:12,640
I would just get the people used to
it so that when it's time, you know,

2881
02:44:12,641 --> 02:44:15,100
if it gets crazy and a revolution comes,
dude,

2882
02:44:15,101 --> 02:44:18,730
all we gotta do is just keep doing what
we're doing. They'll never see it coming.

2883
02:44:18,850 --> 02:44:21,460
People will start dying, aren't
they? No. One near to though.

2884
02:44:22,060 --> 02:44:24,580
Who knows where they're at and I
believe this is what I believe.

2885
02:44:24,640 --> 02:44:27,220
I believe that the pilots don't really
even know what the fuck they're doing.

2886
02:44:27,280 --> 02:44:29,980
I believe they think they're trying to,
they're they're,

2887
02:44:29,981 --> 02:44:34,420
they're claiming that it's
for global warming and it's
to protect the atmosphere.

2888
02:44:34,421 --> 02:44:37,210
Now that we're at the stage now
where we're at the stage now,

2889
02:44:37,211 --> 02:44:40,000
where they're admitting that that's
what they're going to have to do.

2890
02:44:40,030 --> 02:44:42,520
We haven't been doing it.
Who's admitted to do,

2891
02:44:42,530 --> 02:44:46,360
there's so much shit on the government
to go, go on my youtube channel,

2892
02:44:47,120 --> 02:44:51,210
go on my youtube channel and gone the
playlists chem trails. I got mad dude.

2893
02:44:51,970 --> 02:44:54,550
The guy that, you know, what's the
difference between Google and Youtube?

2894
02:44:54,551 --> 02:44:58,280
It's all error. You know? It's true. It's
visual shit. You make it. You have to,

2895
02:44:58,281 --> 02:44:59,890
you kind of have,
people are talking on video,

2896
02:44:59,891 --> 02:45:01,540
you make the decision or
they've brought a shit.

2897
02:45:01,600 --> 02:45:04,390
You look at them and then you look
at the evidence, the video evidence.

2898
02:45:04,660 --> 02:45:06,810
You know most people thought
Oj was guilty and they didn't.

2899
02:45:06,811 --> 02:45:09,340
There was no pictures of her.
That was, there was no video.

2900
02:45:09,370 --> 02:45:12,550
Do you know Joey Diaz calls you
chem trails sometimes. Exactly.

2901
02:45:12,820 --> 02:45:16,690
How's chem trails doing? Dude? You
know what? I think chem trails.

2902
02:45:17,140 --> 02:45:21,550
I think anonymous should be trying to
get to the bottom of why the military is

2903
02:45:21,551 --> 02:45:25,090
spraying aluminum and Barium.
It fucks our body of looking to,

2904
02:45:25,410 --> 02:45:29,230
it fucks up our immune system.
It fucks up our respiratory system.

2905
02:45:29,440 --> 02:45:31,040
I think if there is,

2906
02:45:31,530 --> 02:45:34,930
if there's no barium or
aluminum and they're just,

2907
02:45:35,140 --> 02:45:37,990
I think they're just getting us used to
it because when shit goes down the good,

2908
02:45:37,991 --> 02:45:38,340
the way,

2909
02:45:38,340 --> 02:45:41,590
the good look at the way she going now
they're taking away all our liberty.

2910
02:45:41,650 --> 02:45:43,040
Liberty's look at all the shit that,

2911
02:45:43,041 --> 02:45:47,440
the way they're reacting and battling
occupy Wall Street and all that shit.

2912
02:45:47,710 --> 02:45:50,680
They're making it illegal to
protest in front of this and that.

2913
02:45:50,980 --> 02:45:52,300
The way that shit's going.

2914
02:45:52,700 --> 02:45:55,510
It looks like they're trying
to control the revolution.

2915
02:45:55,630 --> 02:45:59,350
What better way to control the revolution
to just spray these motherfuckers?

2916
02:45:59,740 --> 02:46:02,260
That's the best way. What
do you got? Another way?

2917
02:46:02,261 --> 02:46:03,720
Show me another west the best way.

2918
02:46:03,880 --> 02:46:07,360
Get them used to the lines and then
when it went, if they get too crazy,

2919
02:46:07,510 --> 02:46:10,370
we'll just spray out.
There'll be so easy to calm them down.

2920
02:46:10,430 --> 02:46:14,420
We could put anything in those clouds
and it's in the water. It's in the air,

2921
02:46:14,540 --> 02:46:18,320
dude. It's brilliant what they're doing.
Do you know that there's photos of, uh,

2922
02:46:18,530 --> 02:46:21,770
of chem trails or what?
You know what looks like chem trails?

2923
02:46:21,771 --> 02:46:24,960
The same thing from like the 1940s
apps. They've been doing it, do it.

2924
02:46:24,980 --> 02:46:26,320
They've been testing it on,
on,

2925
02:46:26,540 --> 02:46:30,050
they've been doing in the military sense
from the forties to the 60s and on over

2926
02:46:30,230 --> 02:46:35,030
300 cities. Dude, that's why in
1977 that have put a halt to it.

2927
02:46:35,270 --> 02:46:36,800
They had to put a halt to it.
It was ridiculous.

2928
02:46:36,801 --> 02:46:41,000
They were doing it for over 20 years
straight the and in, in the military.

2929
02:46:41,001 --> 02:46:43,880
That's classic shit.
How do you battle?

2930
02:46:43,910 --> 02:46:47,300
How would you fuck up the enemy spray
shit all over him did using chemical

2931
02:46:47,301 --> 02:46:49,790
weapons. That's old school. They've
been doing that shit forever.

2932
02:46:49,880 --> 02:46:51,500
They didn't have Vietnam
with Agent Orange.

2933
02:46:51,680 --> 02:46:52,820
They've been doing it in the Middle East.

2934
02:46:52,880 --> 02:46:55,730
They've been doing a world war one
World War II. Just spray motherfuckers.

2935
02:46:55,790 --> 02:47:00,230
That's the chemical warfare. That's the
easiest shit. Just fuck them up with the,

2936
02:47:00,410 --> 02:47:01,700
you don't have to drop bombs on him.

2937
02:47:01,710 --> 02:47:03,920
You don't have to destroy
the buildings or anything.

2938
02:47:04,010 --> 02:47:07,550
Just spray whatever you want. Something
that's going to debilitate them slowly.

2939
02:47:07,850 --> 02:47:09,590
I mean for people to think
that it's impossible.

2940
02:47:09,591 --> 02:47:13,220
It already happened and they
had a stop in in 1977 as a,

2941
02:47:13,400 --> 02:47:17,910
that kind of obsessed with dude.
It's, I see it every God damn day.

2942
02:47:17,911 --> 02:47:21,740
You're absolutely convinced. I'm
absolutely did. I don't put anything past.

2943
02:47:21,920 --> 02:47:23,210
I don't put anything past the government.

2944
02:47:23,211 --> 02:47:24,770
I believe there's some
shady shit going on.

2945
02:47:24,771 --> 02:47:26,240
Those aren't commissioner
commercial airlines.

2946
02:47:26,310 --> 02:47:28,640
How do you even coming out of their
commercial airline? Cause I pay attention

2947
02:47:30,140 --> 02:47:31,730
dude.
I've been on the,

2948
02:47:31,731 --> 02:47:35,380
I've been on between Burbank and and lax.

2949
02:47:35,420 --> 02:47:38,180
I've been on like 10,000 flights.
I know the flight patterns.

2950
02:47:38,300 --> 02:47:42,240
I could look up in the sky and know if
that's a commercial airline or have it to

2951
02:47:42,720 --> 02:47:44,350
a jet commercial airlines.

2952
02:47:44,351 --> 02:47:48,020
I like straight up like rockets and
then come across and they're not,

2953
02:47:48,470 --> 02:47:51,590
you've got to, if you pay attention
like you know birdwatchers right?

2954
02:47:51,780 --> 02:47:54,560
Like how do you know,
how do they keep this shit quiet?

2955
02:47:55,250 --> 02:47:56,450
They do anything they want.

2956
02:47:56,930 --> 02:47:59,450
This is above this is they'll
do anything they want did,

2957
02:48:00,020 --> 02:48:01,940
you can't stop them think
this is just practice.

2958
02:48:02,180 --> 02:48:04,730
It could be practice or that we
can be right in the middle of it.

2959
02:48:04,790 --> 02:48:07,490
How much time during the day
do you think about this shit?

2960
02:48:07,670 --> 02:48:11,540
Every time I drive and I fucking see the
sky ruined. But what if it wasn't that?

2961
02:48:11,541 --> 02:48:13,240
What if it really would try?
Dude,

2962
02:48:13,310 --> 02:48:18,060
I hope I'm wrong about chem trails do
cause there's a lot of websites to debunk

2963
02:48:18,061 --> 02:48:22,760
it. Well not just one or two but there's
a lot of like scientific science that

2964
02:48:22,761 --> 02:48:26,810
really deep well they're,
they're just like,

2965
02:48:26,811 --> 02:48:28,970
there's a lot of websites
that debunked nine one one.

2966
02:48:29,120 --> 02:48:33,380
All I know is military jets are making
fucking clouds and who knows the exact

2967
02:48:33,381 --> 02:48:33,980
reason,

2968
02:48:33,980 --> 02:48:38,980
but we have evidence of military people
on a news and weather reports talking

2969
02:48:39,681 --> 02:48:40,460
about chat.

2970
02:48:40,460 --> 02:48:44,660
They're reporting on the chaff and they're
spraying aluminum and Barium in the s

2971
02:48:44,661 --> 02:48:48,500
fund. But I mean to say that all of that
is what you're seeing. And then some,

2972
02:48:48,530 --> 02:48:52,190
sometimes you know,
they may have done tests in the past,

2973
02:48:52,191 --> 02:48:54,620
but what you're seeing when you
see this criss crossing clouds,

2974
02:48:54,860 --> 02:48:57,020
I mean if you talk to a a pilot,

2975
02:48:57,050 --> 02:49:01,580
they explain it in that
it's just something when
atmospheric would water in the

2976
02:49:01,581 --> 02:49:04,700
atmosphere encounters the jet
engines and it creates these,

2977
02:49:04,820 --> 02:49:08,970
it's a contrail depending on how much
water in the atmosphere can actually

2978
02:49:08,971 --> 02:49:12,270
create clouds that the numbers that
they give out, they have like uh,

2979
02:49:12,320 --> 02:49:17,320
the temperatures like give me the
temperature of what it needs to be.

2980
02:49:17,461 --> 02:49:19,110
It needs to be like
30,000 feet in the air.

2981
02:49:19,200 --> 02:49:21,990
Like the humidity and the temperature,
they can't,

2982
02:49:22,020 --> 02:49:24,060
like what's the difference
between contrast and Kendra?

2983
02:49:24,180 --> 02:49:27,420
They can't give you the difference.
What's the difference they have come from,

2984
02:49:27,630 --> 02:49:30,900
from commercial Aircrafts? Do you
think they're doing this as a contrast?

2985
02:49:30,901 --> 02:49:34,530
The ones from commercial
airlines are contract, but
they look the same. The same.

2986
02:49:34,531 --> 02:49:35,850
Sometimes there's photos of him.

2987
02:49:35,851 --> 02:49:39,080
Let's show like commercial Aircrafts and
there it looks like or chem trails. No,

2988
02:49:39,090 --> 02:49:41,100
no, but, but if you pay
attention and you look at it,

2989
02:49:41,101 --> 02:49:43,260
you'll see that it disappears.
It won't last forever.

2990
02:49:43,560 --> 02:49:45,820
There's a big difference between,
uh,

2991
02:49:46,140 --> 02:49:50,190
the ones that lasts the whole day and
one's a disappear within 30 seconds.

2992
02:49:50,191 --> 02:49:53,460
The ones that disappear are
totally not a natural phenomenon.

2993
02:49:53,610 --> 02:49:57,750
It's the jet engine with the heat, with
the ice crystals, but it's different.

2994
02:49:57,751 --> 02:50:01,020
We already know the military sprays
aluminum and Barium and we know that when

2995
02:50:01,021 --> 02:50:04,230
they do that it,
it leaves shit on the weather report.

2996
02:50:04,260 --> 02:50:08,430
They have to explain what it is because
of the aluminum, because of the Barium,

2997
02:50:08,520 --> 02:50:13,520
the weatherman has to explain that
that's just military aluminum and Barium.

2998
02:50:14,220 --> 02:50:17,760
They're explaining that it's already done.
It's not like whether or not they do,

2999
02:50:17,820 --> 02:50:20,100
I mean they definitely
know how to make shit rain.

3000
02:50:20,130 --> 02:50:23,760
There've been doing it in Abu Dhabi.
They make it ran once a week and they put,

3001
02:50:23,761 --> 02:50:28,660
they put chemicals in the sky. Yeah. It's
called cloud seeding clouds sitting up.

3002
02:50:28,661 --> 02:50:32,940
I'm sure there's Barium or it's, it's
either burying them or something. Yeah,

3003
02:50:33,240 --> 02:50:36,300
that's what they're spraying. And that's
what they do with chaff. It, they do it.

3004
02:50:36,330 --> 02:50:40,180
You know, it's this harp. What the fuck
is harp? You don't know what harvest.

3005
02:50:40,230 --> 02:50:44,100
I don't know exactly. I know it scared
Jesse Ventura says it's bad, dude. It's,

3006
02:50:44,660 --> 02:50:47,400
it's, it's one of those things
where you all I know about harp,

3007
02:50:47,580 --> 02:50:52,230
all I know about harp is, um,
look into it, man. It's, it's,

3008
02:50:52,410 --> 02:50:55,660
it used to be, it used to be, uh,

3009
02:50:56,010 --> 02:50:59,940
a scientific project shooting
something in the atmosphere.

3010
02:51:00,370 --> 02:51:01,710
It's like a billion.

3011
02:51:01,770 --> 02:51:05,310
It's like a football field filled with
all these electrical coils that make like

3012
02:51:05,311 --> 02:51:09,330
a billion. And they can direct a
billion watts into the atmosphere.

3013
02:51:09,450 --> 02:51:14,450
They're experimenting with the ionosphere
or whatever the fuck that means.

3014
02:51:15,720 --> 02:51:20,720
They're shooting electricity into
the atmosphere and experimenting,

3015
02:51:20,851 --> 02:51:24,600
which it, some people think they're
experimenting with whether control and,

3016
02:51:24,830 --> 02:51:29,460
and uh, um, you, you love
conspiracy though. No. But now, now,

3017
02:51:29,740 --> 02:51:31,270
now,
now it got taken out.

3018
02:51:31,271 --> 02:51:36,060
It's not a scientific project now it's
top secret and it's now it's all air

3019
02:51:36,061 --> 02:51:40,170
force, military, a top secret. They won't
tell anybody what it is. It does exist.

3020
02:51:40,250 --> 02:51:43,330
Punch in harp. It's not a
concern. No, no noise. It's real.

3021
02:51:43,670 --> 02:51:48,060
But what they're doing as a
conspiracy. Yeah. Who knows? Uh, it's,

3022
02:51:48,120 --> 02:51:52,700
it's fascinating. It's fascinating.
But you fucking love this shit, dude.

3023
02:51:53,160 --> 02:51:56,390
I hope. I hope I'm wrong, Dude.
I hope I'm wrong, but Julie,

3024
02:51:56,670 --> 02:51:58,830
I know you do you want to have your,
to me,

3025
02:51:58,920 --> 02:52:00,970
if someone proved it to
me that I was wrong, Dude,

3026
02:52:00,971 --> 02:52:04,460
and I would admit it and I would love
it and I would feel great, I'd be like,

3027
02:52:04,470 --> 02:52:08,110
fuck, I don't have to, when you read
the, the sites, the debunk chem trails,

3028
02:52:08,111 --> 02:52:10,240
you just don't find their
arguments. In fact, no, no.

3029
02:52:10,241 --> 02:52:14,210
It's the same people that think
that at nine one one collapse,

3030
02:52:14,211 --> 02:52:16,960
do fired at the same people,
that same mentality they refuse.

3031
02:52:17,140 --> 02:52:19,150
It's like a game to them.
They just want to be right.

3032
02:52:19,300 --> 02:52:21,790
You look at all the evidence.
We already have evidence.

3033
02:52:21,791 --> 02:52:24,280
We have it's military chaff.
We already know that.

3034
02:52:24,340 --> 02:52:26,160
They're already talking
about Geo engineering.

3035
02:52:26,310 --> 02:52:29,500
They were talking about it in 1996
that they were going to have to suspend

3036
02:52:29,501 --> 02:52:30,520
metallic particles in the air.

3037
02:52:30,770 --> 02:52:35,770
As Zachariah Sitchin was talking about
this in the 70s that that was going to

3038
02:52:36,701 --> 02:52:40,900
happen. I was, you know, he said that's
how the Annunaki, that's how they,

3039
02:52:41,680 --> 02:52:45,730
that's how they protected their atmosphere
by so south to get high and talk

3040
02:52:45,731 --> 02:52:49,060
about the Annunaki. I mean, I don't
know if the unlucky he was real or not,

3041
02:52:49,061 --> 02:52:51,580
but God damn,
would it be fun if they were real,

3042
02:52:51,760 --> 02:52:54,310
but it would so suck if they were real.
If we,

3043
02:52:54,311 --> 02:52:58,780
if it turned out that we weren't the apex
of the biological life in the universe,

3044
02:52:58,930 --> 02:53:01,420
if we're not at the top of the heap,
we're fucked man.

3045
02:53:01,480 --> 02:53:04,230
Cause someone's going to treat us the
way we treat everything else. You know?

3046
02:53:04,510 --> 02:53:07,330
So if the Annunaki are real,
you should really hope they're not real.

3047
02:53:07,510 --> 02:53:10,240
We should hope that we become the Annunaki
should hope that the film, of course,

3048
02:53:10,241 --> 02:53:12,100
our junior version as the best version,

3049
02:53:12,370 --> 02:53:14,980
the fact that there's a time machine
and we're going to become that in the

3050
02:53:14,981 --> 02:53:19,870
future. That seems to me to make more
sense. There's probably, who knows man,

3051
02:53:19,900 --> 02:53:23,290
any when it comes to Ufo every day.

3052
02:53:23,291 --> 02:53:27,730
Now it's in the science community and
astrophysical we're finding there's,

3053
02:53:27,790 --> 02:53:30,730
you get all these, all this
information coming out that there,

3054
02:53:30,910 --> 02:53:33,970
there's all of these new
earth's that they're,

3055
02:53:34,030 --> 02:53:38,650
they're predicting they're just earth
everywhere and there's life teeming in our

3056
02:53:38,651 --> 02:53:41,560
galaxy. Everyone, like
there's on the daily,

3057
02:53:41,561 --> 02:53:43,510
they're finding evidence like holy shit,

3058
02:53:43,630 --> 02:53:48,300
there's probably a billion fucking
earths in our galaxy or some shit they're

3059
02:53:48,301 --> 02:53:51,880
putting out is pretty crazy.
When you think about the possibilities,

3060
02:53:52,120 --> 02:53:53,530
possibilities are endless.

3061
02:53:53,560 --> 02:53:57,400
They're really can have life seeds from
other planets getting hit by asteroids

3062
02:53:57,401 --> 02:54:00,070
and it's all a natural part of
the process. Think about this.

3063
02:54:00,071 --> 02:54:02,800
If there's a million earths in
this guy that just say a million,

3064
02:54:02,950 --> 02:54:07,000
how many of those herbs are
ahead of us in technology?

3065
02:54:07,001 --> 02:54:11,080
I'm sure there's some that are
like not as far as we've come,

3066
02:54:11,290 --> 02:54:14,680
but there's a, you know, just the
odds you look at like a scientist,

3067
02:54:14,920 --> 02:54:16,930
there's a million right,
that you would say,

3068
02:54:16,990 --> 02:54:21,410
let's just say a thousand are
way ahead of us. God dammit,

3069
02:54:21,460 --> 02:54:26,350
that's a thousand a thousand race.
There must be a galactic federation there.

3070
02:54:26,980 --> 02:54:27,813
There must be,

3071
02:54:27,880 --> 02:54:30,910
I think may comment said to be like
a little bit smarter than this.

3072
02:54:30,910 --> 02:54:34,420
And then we just blow shit up over and
over again. I think that's what we do.

3073
02:54:34,640 --> 02:54:37,690
There was a, you know what,
there's a possibility that, uh,

3074
02:54:37,750 --> 02:54:39,900
out of all the earth and all the,
the,

3075
02:54:39,990 --> 02:54:42,820
the human like careers
within the front of the line,

3076
02:54:43,230 --> 02:54:47,290
like maybe 70% of them don't make it.
You know, like in, in the Roman times,

3077
02:54:47,440 --> 02:54:51,040
it was a 50% mortality rate. When you
have a kid, there's a happened, ha ha,

3078
02:54:51,490 --> 02:54:55,330
there's 50% chance that it's
going to die in Roman times.

3079
02:54:55,450 --> 02:54:58,770
So maybe it's like that. Maybe
there's 50% chance that, you know,

3080
02:54:58,780 --> 02:55:01,960
we get to a point and we
just blow ourselves up cause
corruption takes over and

3081
02:55:01,990 --> 02:55:04,010
evil just takes them.
And then there's a

3082
02:55:04,010 --> 02:55:04,761
small percentage,

3083
02:55:04,761 --> 02:55:09,761
maybe it's like 10% 20% of all of these
earth like planets that actually get

3084
02:55:10,131 --> 02:55:13,430
past that and we all connect
and we're living like,

3085
02:55:13,640 --> 02:55:18,590
you know that when they have
like a category one society's,

3086
02:55:18,591 --> 02:55:21,590
you know, level one society
and level two that, you know,

3087
02:55:21,650 --> 02:55:26,600
I think a Michio Kaku has done this
like explaining the different levels of,

3088
02:55:26,630 --> 02:55:26,931
you know,

3089
02:55:26,931 --> 02:55:30,230
societies that can get to a point where
they get away from physical violence,

3090
02:55:30,231 --> 02:55:31,370
then they can,
you know,

3091
02:55:31,371 --> 02:55:35,630
use a harness the power of the stars
and then space travel and all sorts of

3092
02:55:35,631 --> 02:55:37,280
different categories and that we're,

3093
02:55:37,281 --> 02:55:41,100
we're like on the verge of becoming
significant. There's, there's,

3094
02:55:41,660 --> 02:55:46,660
I personally believe just based on just
basic odds that there is a galactic

3095
02:55:47,061 --> 02:55:51,590
federation and maybe we are just,
we don't know about it.

3096
02:55:51,591 --> 02:55:54,140
Maybe the elite know about it and
they're communicating with them,

3097
02:55:54,141 --> 02:55:57,260
but the people we don't want to
leave. You know, I think our elite,

3098
02:55:57,261 --> 02:55:59,300
there are people at the top.
They're not all at the bottom.

3099
02:55:59,330 --> 02:56:01,970
There's people at the top.
This is a very real,

3100
02:56:02,510 --> 02:56:06,620
I think the very real possibility that
our number one problem is that we're

3101
02:56:06,621 --> 02:56:10,490
separated from this idea of how
connected we all to each other because

3102
02:56:10,491 --> 02:56:14,480
psychedelics are illegal. That's why this
world in this country that we live in,

3103
02:56:14,481 --> 02:56:17,390
this government that we're running to
is so fucked up and corrupt because they

3104
02:56:17,391 --> 02:56:20,720
don't deserve to be in the
position they're ad they've
never had a life changing

3105
02:56:20,721 --> 02:56:25,070
experience to the point where they
have experienced that other side of of

3106
02:56:25,071 --> 02:56:27,560
possible reality that comes
from the psychedelic experience.

3107
02:56:27,830 --> 02:56:28,910
You can't get past that.

3108
02:56:28,940 --> 02:56:32,570
It's unbelievably humbling and you
should be looking for that in a leader.

3109
02:56:32,571 --> 02:56:35,720
You shouldn't want a leader that hasn't
that psychedelic experiences cause

3110
02:56:35,721 --> 02:56:38,570
that's a person who hasn't really
faced whatever the fuck that is.

3111
02:56:38,690 --> 02:56:40,280
When you strip away culture,

3112
02:56:40,281 --> 02:56:45,281
when you strip away language and you
just see truth and love in this humbling

3113
02:56:45,291 --> 02:56:46,280
Bayer form,

3114
02:56:46,281 --> 02:56:49,340
they'd just like rips you to your
core and makes you sorta rebuild and

3115
02:56:49,341 --> 02:56:51,560
restructure who you are as a human being.

3116
02:56:51,890 --> 02:56:53,900
A lot of those motherfuckers
have never had that man.

3117
02:56:53,901 --> 02:56:56,270
There's a lot of people that
are out there running around,

3118
02:56:56,271 --> 02:56:59,120
flapping their gums that have
never really been humbled by life.

3119
02:56:59,390 --> 02:57:02,390
They never be really been humbled
by a psychedelic experience,

3120
02:57:02,391 --> 02:57:06,680
which is a part of life. It's not just
a choice. I think it's a part of life.

3121
02:57:06,681 --> 02:57:09,470
It certainly is a choice. I mean don't
get me wrong, don't do it. If you,

3122
02:57:09,860 --> 02:57:13,640
if you don't do drugs and you can't handle
even a drink, you know, don't, don't go,

3123
02:57:13,641 --> 02:57:17,030
don't do anything you're not comfortable
with, but it's a part of life man.

3124
02:57:17,030 --> 02:57:20,060
That's why it's here. That's why it
works on you. The reason why it works,

3125
02:57:20,360 --> 02:57:23,580
he says cause it's here for to work
for you. It's a part of you. You're,

3126
02:57:23,581 --> 02:57:28,190
you're part of a giant system.
Get some mushrooms in your head bitch.

3127
02:57:29,140 --> 02:57:32,610
Right? Yeah, man, I got to take off.
I gotta I gotta end this to this.

3128
02:57:32,670 --> 02:57:37,310
How long did we go? Almost three hours.
Two hours of 57 minutes. How Fun was that?

3129
02:57:37,340 --> 02:57:38,330
Did we do enough of it?
Man,

3130
02:57:38,331 --> 02:57:40,580
I don't want people passed on and
we did a lot of shit. We did a,

3131
02:57:40,640 --> 02:57:45,140
it was a beautiful thing,
man. These conversations are
so far. Um, effortless. Yeah.

3132
02:57:45,141 --> 02:57:46,920
Yeah, it was great. I love doing that. Oh,

3133
02:57:46,921 --> 02:57:49,220
I'm going to do more of these
one on one conversations.

3134
02:57:49,370 --> 02:57:52,400
I think sometimes it's different, you
know, it mixes it up a little bit.

3135
02:57:52,580 --> 02:57:54,880
We've got a lot of cool a guest
this week though. I think we're,

3136
02:57:55,070 --> 02:57:56,840
I think Chael Sonnen's this week.
I'm not sure.

3137
02:57:57,140 --> 02:58:00,610
I got to call is going to be
awesome. When is that? I don't know.

3138
02:58:00,640 --> 02:58:02,760
