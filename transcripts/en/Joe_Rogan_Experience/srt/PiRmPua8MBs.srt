1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,650
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,170
Did you hear about the new electric,

3
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:03,640
uh,

4
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:07,530
our age of a cow tipping that's going
on in San Francisco and stuff like that.

5
00:00:07,531 --> 00:00:12,531
People are flipping those little baby
electric small cars and it's called smart

6
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,560
smart card tipping or something.

7
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:15,403
Yeah.

8
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,160
Fuck wow.

9
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,600
Imagine if you went outside and you,

10
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,310
you're a girl and you
weigh a hundred pounds.

11
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:22,640
That's a dick move past.

12
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:23,011
What was it?

13
00:00:23,011 --> 00:00:23,311
Dick move.

14
00:00:23,311 --> 00:00:24,660
I also think I,

15
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:25,890
so I grew up in the suburbs.

16
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,260
I did not see a lot of cows,

17
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:29,130
I guess from time to time,

18
00:00:29,131 --> 00:00:31,740
but like can you actually tip a cow a no.

19
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:32,160
Yes.

20
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:32,671
Yes you can.

21
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:33,540
There's a huge no,

22
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:33,661
no,

23
00:00:33,661 --> 00:00:33,930
no,

24
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:34,561
we've done it.

25
00:00:34,561 --> 00:00:35,394
Just wants you to save it.

26
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:36,190
Yeah,

27
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:36,530
yeah,

28
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:36,860
yeah.

29
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:37,110
Yes.

30
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:37,943
We did.

31
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:38,401
Columbus,

32
00:00:38,401 --> 00:00:38,671
Ohio.

33
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:40,050
Me and my friends did it twice.

34
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,371
You've done it right?

35
00:00:41,371 --> 00:00:42,330
Was it like a calf?

36
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,500
Was it like one of those calves to just
so what happens isn't that when the cows

37
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:48,510
and the cows are in the fields,

38
00:00:48,511 --> 00:00:50,520
they pretty much locked
their legs and sleep,

39
00:00:50,521 --> 00:00:51,420
standing up a lot.

40
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,253
That's how I sleep.

41
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,310
And so you just go next to him and
push them and they usually just fall to

42
00:00:55,311 --> 00:00:55,800
heavy.

43
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:55,980
No,

44
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:56,251
they,

45
00:00:56,251 --> 00:00:56,561
they,

46
00:00:56,561 --> 00:00:59,510
they just tip right over
hyping cow tipping site.

47
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,770
This was stuff that suburban kids know,

48
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:03,061
like,

49
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:03,541
or that like,

50
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:06,120
it's an urban lore because none
of us ever hung out with cows.

51
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,100
If you ever want to go cow tipping,

52
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:09,120
I'll take it.

53
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:11,730
They would really like that,

54
00:01:11,731 --> 00:01:12,564
but no,

55
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:13,403
they don't like it.

56
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,820
I wouldn't like it.

57
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,040
Did you really go cow tipping Brian twice?

58
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:17,311
Yeah.

59
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:17,790
Twice.

60
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,230
Can you find a new one using video

61
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,353
or believe it?

62
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:22,830
Yeah,

63
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,210
me and two of my friends.

64
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:25,021
Okay.

65
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:25,920
And I want it to be one of those,

66
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,870
remember those night vision
like the Paris Hilton videos.

67
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:30,440
I want it to be one of those night
vision videos of the cow tipping over.

68
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,113
All right.

69
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:32,841
Do you have a,

70
00:01:32,841 --> 00:01:33,201
um,

71
00:01:33,201 --> 00:01:34,034
an Instagram?

72
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:34,701
I do.

73
00:01:34,701 --> 00:01:34,911
It's,

74
00:01:34,911 --> 00:01:35,331
it's my name.

75
00:01:35,331 --> 00:01:38,110
Just add Alexis Ohanian or neon.

76
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:39,913
Okay.

77
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:45,970
That's another thing that's annoying
about these things is that they insist on

78
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:48,840
trying to change what you wrote there.

79
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,090
Like my creative,

80
00:01:50,091 --> 00:01:50,930
the ethnic,

81
00:01:50,931 --> 00:01:51,530
uh,

82
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:52,363
yeah.

83
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,260
They're not gonna take it personally.

84
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,730
They're their auto correct
is like really aggressive.

85
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,130
He's Cather and goofy.

86
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:04,380
They're awake.

87
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:04,621
Yeah.

88
00:02:04,621 --> 00:02:05,550
Well then good luck.

89
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,413
They're going to kill you.

90
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:11,831
I see.

91
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:11,961
No,

92
00:02:11,961 --> 00:02:14,910
and I was tempted to look at these
videos before you put them online,

93
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:15,400
Bro.

94
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,440
Seriously find something real.

95
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,633
Yeah,

96
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,151
you can do that.

97
00:02:19,151 --> 00:02:19,984
I'll just go right.

98
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,380
Yeah,

99
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,213
yeah.

100
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:21,890
I Dunno.

101
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:22,723
I don't know.

102
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,450
I want him some show.

103
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:27,810
He might have thought he
would count it on mushrooms.

104
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,160
Tripled his balls off to we tip cat cows,

105
00:02:30,161 --> 00:02:31,630
but we never left the house,

106
00:02:31,631 --> 00:02:31,871
man.

107
00:02:31,871 --> 00:02:32,704
What are you talking about?

108
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:33,700
We were in the field.

109
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:34,360
You don't remember.

110
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,193
I was there.

111
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,020
I was tipping cows.

112
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:38,471
Yeah,

113
00:02:38,471 --> 00:02:38,681
I bet.

114
00:02:38,681 --> 00:02:40,120
If we Snopes tipping cows,

115
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,590
let's Snopes Snopes,

116
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:42,603
count it back.

117
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,080
I should have brought my laptop also.

118
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,000
Side Note.

119
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,240
Uh,

120
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,670
and I've,

121
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,080
I've enjoyed your podcast died.

122
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,230
I love how I love the real
time with the laptops.

123
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:51,370
Uh,

124
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:51,790
I wish,

125
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,870
I wish every show basically had someone
in real time just calling out shit.

126
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,470
Here we go.

127
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:56,850
Ready?

128
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:57,460
All right,

129
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,570
let's get this out of the way.

130
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,433
Cow,

131
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,380
at least as popularly imagined,

132
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,740
does not exist.

133
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:07,180
Drunk men do not on any regular basis
sneaking in cow pastures and put a hard

134
00:03:07,181 --> 00:03:09,340
shoulder to a cow taking
a standing snooze,

135
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:12,880
dus tipping the poor animal over
while in the history of the world,

136
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:17,290
there have surely been a few unlucky cow
shoved there side by boozed up morons.

137
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,520
We feel confident in saying that this
happens at a rate roughly equivalent to

138
00:03:21,521 --> 00:03:24,220
the Chicago cubs winning
the world series and that,

139
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:25,811
okay,

140
00:03:25,811 --> 00:03:26,780
this is um,

141
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,693
got Snopes

142
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,420
cows.

143
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:32,920
Cows like sit down in like on their legs
and just sit there and you can go right

144
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,360
up to him and tip them right over.

145
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:37,930
This is from modern farmer.com.

146
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:38,981
Well,

147
00:03:38,981 --> 00:03:40,750
I'm convinced article on cow tipping.

148
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,690
I've subscribed modern farmer
for a decade now and I,

149
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:44,890
they have never led me astray.

150
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:45,521
Youtube,

151
00:03:45,521 --> 00:03:48,760
the largest clearinghouse of human
stupidity the world has ever known,

152
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:48,950
right?

153
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:53,050
You can watch hours of kids
taking the cinnamon challenge.

154
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:57,430
Teens jumping off route two rooftops
on the trampolines and the explosive

155
00:03:57,431 --> 00:04:02,431
results of fireworks set off indoors
fails to deliver one single actual cow

156
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:04,600
tipping video.

157
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:05,743
All right,

158
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,051
well,

159
00:04:06,051 --> 00:04:07,160
we did it as a kid.

160
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,600
The one exception is a
Russian dash cam video,

161
00:04:10,601 --> 00:04:13,990
which shows a semi truck
full of cattle overturning.

162
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,010
That's really good.

163
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:18,340
You need to watch it shaking
themselves off and walking away.

164
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:19,720
How's not giving a fuck?

165
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,270
Yeah.

166
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:20,680
Wow.

167
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,940
This is a spectacular dash.

168
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:22,660
So this uh,

169
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,550
this article is calling
bullshit on your prime.

170
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,560
When I was younger,

171
00:04:25,561 --> 00:04:28,110
we would go to these farms in planes,

172
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:28,981
plain city,

173
00:04:28,981 --> 00:04:33,030
Ohio and they would have tons of cows
and we would break into the cows,

174
00:04:33,031 --> 00:04:35,910
smoked weed and there'd be cows
that will be end into the cows.

175
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,950
No break into the fence.

176
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,790
And there would be cows that would sit
there like on there like perched up like

177
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,530
on there like legs.

178
00:04:43,531 --> 00:04:46,140
Like it's just sitting there sleeping
would come over and just push him right

179
00:04:46,141 --> 00:04:46,650
over.

180
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:49,470
I don't know if that's the cow tipping
that you've heard everybody doing like

181
00:04:49,471 --> 00:04:51,060
people saying that the cows tip over.

182
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,820
But that's what we used to do cause that's
what we thought you were supposed to

183
00:04:53,821 --> 00:04:54,270
do.

184
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,920
I don't understand what you just said.

185
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,360
This cows are standing up right?

186
00:04:57,361 --> 00:04:58,680
Cause they stand up when they sleep,

187
00:04:58,681 --> 00:04:58,890
right?

188
00:04:58,890 --> 00:04:59,410
No,

189
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:00,460
not all the time there.

190
00:05:00,461 --> 00:05:03,120
There's cows like Nathan here.

191
00:05:03,121 --> 00:05:03,900
I'll show you.

192
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,620
Okay.

193
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,700
I thought cal was always stood out.

194
00:05:05,701 --> 00:05:06,660
Horses always stand up.

195
00:05:06,661 --> 00:05:07,100
Right.

196
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:07,770
Uh,

197
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:08,720
I have no idea.

198
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,380
I'm going to my guts telling
me horses are the ones.

199
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:12,771
Yeah.

200
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,030
Horses I think always stand up,

201
00:05:14,031 --> 00:05:14,620
right?

202
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,110
Yeah.

203
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,741
And if they're down,

204
00:05:15,741 --> 00:05:16,280
they're hurt.

205
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,113
We have the Google.

206
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,273
Yeah.

207
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:18,880
Um,

208
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,190
but I'm,

209
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:19,791
I'm really Shantel.

210
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:20,624
This cow tipping.

211
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,560
Sorry.

212
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,120
We get the Internet disagrees with you.

213
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:23,781
Oh,

214
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:24,300
look at that.

215
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,133
That's a

216
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,030
brown cow.

217
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,060
How rolling the cat would be like that.

218
00:05:29,061 --> 00:05:29,880
And he would just push it.

219
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,240
Yeah.

220
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,660
But there'd be tons of cows and it'll
be night at timing would be drunk.

221
00:05:33,661 --> 00:05:34,494
And that's what we used to do it.

222
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,240
I don't know.

223
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,610
That seems to be cow tipping.

224
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:37,150
Yeah.

225
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,420
Technically that's cow tipping.

226
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,030
They're just lying down cows.

227
00:05:40,031 --> 00:05:42,470
So you're going to send
the email to Snopes saying,

228
00:05:42,471 --> 00:05:44,540
well actually you're wrong.

229
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,493
Well,

230
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,900
I have a feeling the problem
with calling bullshit.

231
00:05:47,901 --> 00:05:49,880
If you didn't grow up in that environment,

232
00:05:49,881 --> 00:05:52,310
you might truly believe
that it is bullshit.

233
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:56,690
But then at the guy like Brian actually
grew up there and actually pushed over

234
00:05:56,691 --> 00:05:57,350
some,

235
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,040
can we take this to

236
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,930
your fan base?

237
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:02,810
They would sit like this and then you're
just like [inaudible] go over there and

238
00:06:02,811 --> 00:06:06,230
just push them over and they would roll
over and wake up and freak out and it

239
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:06,891
would be scary.

240
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:09,200
And you'd would run away
that now cow tipping.

241
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:13,040
What I think they're saying is not
true is actually tipping over a cal.

242
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,840
It's like completely standing up.

243
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:15,280
Maybe.

244
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,590
Well maybe that's what
people have in their head,

245
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,450
but what it really is
is what you're talking

246
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,313
the cal rolling.

247
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,550
That's when we did it.

248
00:06:21,551 --> 00:06:22,001
We just did,

249
00:06:22,001 --> 00:06:23,800
cause we heard people did
it and then we were like,

250
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:24,431
let's do it.

251
00:06:24,431 --> 00:06:25,630
There's tons of cows here.

252
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,410
Brian redband move.

253
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,730
People are doing it.

254
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,271
And I'm like,

255
00:06:31,271 --> 00:06:32,380
well this show alive.

256
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:33,843
Fuck it.

257
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:34,770
Fuck it.

258
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,610
So then cow tipping is real.

259
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,230
I guess if I would say

260
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,350
it depends it well yeah it coul rolling.

261
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,340
I'm gonna call it cal rolling.

262
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,513
Roll

263
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:47,090
cow tipping as an account standing
up and you pushing it over.

264
00:06:47,091 --> 00:06:48,050
That doesn't exist.

265
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,460
But that's probably not what cow
tipping ever was unless they do sleep.

266
00:06:52,461 --> 00:06:53,430
Standing up the couch,

267
00:06:53,431 --> 00:06:54,020
sleep standing up.

268
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:54,340
Okay,

269
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:57,740
we need to call me tons of
pictures of cows doing exactly how.

270
00:06:57,741 --> 00:06:57,981
Yeah,

271
00:06:57,981 --> 00:06:59,390
but did they also sleep standing up,

272
00:06:59,391 --> 00:07:00,050
I should say.

273
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:03,050
Let me just say how much I appreciate
you guys get into the bottom of this.

274
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,760
We need to worst case.

275
00:07:04,761 --> 00:07:06,170
How far are we from some cows?

276
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:06,981
Oh,

277
00:07:06,981 --> 00:07:07,730
not that far.

278
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:08,870
We can get to 100 an hour.

279
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:09,763
Okay.

280
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,371
Does it count?

281
00:07:10,371 --> 00:07:11,091
Sleep standing?

282
00:07:11,091 --> 00:07:13,700
Common misconception
that cows don't lie down.

283
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:18,980
Why cows may doze off for a few
minutes at a time while standing up.

284
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:23,240
They typically lie down to
sleep or simply to rest.

285
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:23,720
Okay,

286
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,970
I'm calling bullshit on the
people calling bullshit.

287
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,500
I think Brian's right.

288
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,120
I think Brian is right.

289
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,270
He went cow tipping and that's how you
really count because what everybody says

290
00:07:32,271 --> 00:07:34,580
is the cows are sleeping
and you go up and push him.

291
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:34,911
Well,

292
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,200
obviously if that's not true,

293
00:07:36,201 --> 00:07:39,250
if they only take a little nap standing
up and usually they sleep lying down,

294
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,880
then their whole premise sucks because
they don't understand what cow tipping

295
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:44,723
is.

296
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,240
Calex hipping starts from the knees,

297
00:07:47,241 --> 00:07:48,230
like Jujitsu class.

298
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,000
Like if you take wrestling class,

299
00:07:50,001 --> 00:07:51,650
you start standing up for the most part,

300
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,950
a room full of 50 dudes trying
to double leg each other.

301
00:07:54,951 --> 00:07:56,330
That shit gets really dangerous.

302
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,590
So jujitsu classes,

303
00:07:57,591 --> 00:07:58,730
I'll start from the knees.

304
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:03,770
So real cow tipping like the idea of
it doesn't exist because that's like

305
00:08:03,771 --> 00:08:04,760
wrestling style.

306
00:08:04,761 --> 00:08:05,840
Everybody starts from their feet.

307
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:09,080
But jujitsu style when
you're already on the ground,

308
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:09,940
that's real.

309
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,461
This is great.

310
00:08:10,461 --> 00:08:13,250
Now whenever I drive past a bunch of
cows will be thinking about Jujitsu.

311
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:14,750
I just what I do,

312
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,583
that's the vision.

313
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,423
That's my gift.

314
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,181
You should,

315
00:08:17,181 --> 00:08:17,570
um,

316
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:18,403
you should totally

317
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,110
no snuff to go fuck themselves.

318
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,920
The craziest thing is that modern
farmer incorporate or whatever it is,

319
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:24,940
how scary it was.

320
00:08:24,941 --> 00:08:28,080
I just remembered it now because I'd
be scared I wouldn't go that way.

321
00:08:28,081 --> 00:08:28,701
I'm not going over there.

322
00:08:28,701 --> 00:08:30,100
That man we did,

323
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:30,970
I remember twice,

324
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,450
but we only remembers twice.

325
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,340
First Time scared the fuck out of
you and then you're like listen,

326
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,310
I can do better.

327
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,450
And the reason why it's
because one of the,

328
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:44,620
we used to hang out with this bridge
where we would drink and under age and it

329
00:08:44,621 --> 00:08:47,500
was just like everyone would go to this
bridge in the middle of nowhere and

330
00:08:47,501 --> 00:08:50,320
there was all these farms around it and
that's why we'd go there cause there was

331
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:50,861
no police,

332
00:08:50,861 --> 00:08:52,390
there's no one could
even know you were there.

333
00:08:52,391 --> 00:08:55,800
You see you can have bonfires and all
this shit like that sit after he got

334
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:56,251
wasted,

335
00:08:56,251 --> 00:08:57,060
everyone kind of just move,

336
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,490
laid around in all the
fields and one of the fields,

337
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,593
his cows,

338
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:03,060
and it was pitch black because it
was in the middle of the country.

339
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:07,590
So it was just stars and you see shadows
of cows and so you would like sneak up

340
00:09:07,591 --> 00:09:08,700
going up to these cows.

341
00:09:08,701 --> 00:09:10,860
You didn't have cell phones for
lights or anything like that.

342
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:14,700
So it was literally just lighters and
Shit and you just go up and just push it

343
00:09:14,701 --> 00:09:15,151
real fast.

344
00:09:15,151 --> 00:09:18,930
And then we'll go and you'd just run
away and it was the scariest shit ever.

345
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,500
Wow.

346
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,400
And you'd be stoked.

347
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:25,260
Did you ever find mushrooms
on those cow patties?

348
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:25,591
Yeah,

349
00:09:25,591 --> 00:09:28,110
but back then you just
didn't think about that.

350
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,430
Like I didn't get into mushrooms too.

351
00:09:29,431 --> 00:09:30,264
I was in college,

352
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,950
Dunkin went to school in Asheville,

353
00:09:31,951 --> 00:09:36,240
North Carolina and when I went up there
I understand Dunkin so much more after

354
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:40,530
visiting Asheville cause it's just a
hippie Mecca and they were getting,

355
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:43,960
there's apparently the mushroom
flora or whatever it is.

356
00:09:43,961 --> 00:09:48,370
The spores are so healthy up there because
it rains a lot and there's so many of

357
00:09:48,371 --> 00:09:53,371
them that they had to start giving the
cows some sort of an antifungal diet to

358
00:09:53,531 --> 00:09:58,360
kill the mushrooms because so many core
harvesting meanwhile probably makes the

359
00:09:58,361 --> 00:09:59,051
kids sick.

360
00:09:59,051 --> 00:10:00,970
Cause a few mushrooms
probably grow on that.

361
00:10:00,971 --> 00:10:04,810
Some poor poisoned psilocybin when you
want to talk about missing the fucking

362
00:10:04,811 --> 00:10:05,644
point right.

363
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:08,320
Poisoning cow shit.

364
00:10:08,321 --> 00:10:12,220
So that the most beautiful thing that
God ever created can't grow there.

365
00:10:12,221 --> 00:10:13,450
You fucking dummies.

366
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:17,890
But he said that they would constantly
go there and just pluck them off and just

367
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,221
eat them.

368
00:10:18,221 --> 00:10:21,610
They were everywhere and just trip balls.

369
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,860
The whole town is so psychedelic,

370
00:10:23,861 --> 00:10:25,390
like partially because of that.

371
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,850
The whole town is like Asheville,

372
00:10:27,851 --> 00:10:28,571
North Carolina.

373
00:10:28,571 --> 00:10:30,040
Is it trippy fucking place?

374
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,180
I feel like I need to visit now.

375
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:31,871
You got to visit.

376
00:10:31,871 --> 00:10:32,620
It's awesome.

377
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,341
It's really cool.

378
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:36,340
Everybody's walking around like they
have a main area where like bars and

379
00:10:36,341 --> 00:10:39,070
restaurants are and he would just walking
around like everybody's walking around

380
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:43,390
and it's like a small town
that exists in a giant world,

381
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,410
but they're modern.

382
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,480
Since I fucked up,

383
00:10:46,481 --> 00:10:47,690
I shouldn't have told
you guys about it up.

384
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:48,521
Now we're going to go a road.

385
00:10:48,521 --> 00:10:49,354
Asheville,

386
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,020
they the,

387
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:54,430
but I kind of understand Dunkin way
more now after going to this town.

388
00:10:54,431 --> 00:10:54,730
It's like,

389
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:55,271
oh,

390
00:10:55,271 --> 00:10:56,104
I see.

391
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,071
Like you,

392
00:10:57,071 --> 00:11:00,190
you were spawned in one of the
most awesome environments on earth.

393
00:11:00,191 --> 00:11:01,900
Like this place is fucking sweet.

394
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,620
What?

395
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,850
What did they call it

396
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:05,570
when they went out on an expedition?

397
00:11:05,571 --> 00:11:06,404
I wonder,

398
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,740
do you want to go like candy harvesting?

399
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:11,040
Yeah.

400
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:11,873
Some kind of thing

401
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:13,970
that's,

402
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,260
it's so dangerous though,

403
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,560
because I remember even as a kid just
going up and eating berries cause I was

404
00:11:18,561 --> 00:11:18,680
like,

405
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,600
oh look berries.

406
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,890
I would just start kicking fairies.

407
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,190
Wow.

408
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:22,490
You know?

409
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:26,900
And then like you find out something
with us kids a hundred years ago,

410
00:11:26,901 --> 00:11:28,220
you would never survive.

411
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,130
There's no way you would have
been dead before you were fire.

412
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,190
Yeah.

413
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,550
But anyways,

414
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,640
that honeysuckle shit like I used to
eat out a lot of plant because there's

415
00:11:37,641 --> 00:11:38,121
nothing to do.

416
00:11:38,121 --> 00:11:38,451
So you look,

417
00:11:38,451 --> 00:11:39,590
what's that purple stuff for you?

418
00:11:39,591 --> 00:11:40,140
Pull it out.

419
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,020
Just suck on it has nothing to do.

420
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,261
Yeah.

421
00:11:42,261 --> 00:11:43,670
So we just eat grass.

422
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:44,210
Yeah.

423
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:45,260
I would eat a few things.

424
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,710
You know what I found out that
tastes good actually is dandy lions.

425
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:49,800
Like Danny Lyon,

426
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,970
Greens make salads at a Dandelion Greens.

427
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,980
Grandmother used to make

428
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,610
them and I went over the house once
and she had this Dandy Lion Salad.

429
00:11:57,611 --> 00:11:57,971
I was like,

430
00:11:57,971 --> 00:12:01,090
what is that in the garden dandy lines.

431
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,230
And they were like,

432
00:12:02,231 --> 00:12:02,981
it's really good for you.

433
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:03,990
It's edible to my aunt,

434
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,470
my uncle telling me it was good for me.

435
00:12:05,471 --> 00:12:06,580
I think is what convinced me,

436
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,970
but then I found out that it's like a
common vegetable that a lot of people eat

437
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,530
to meet.

438
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,630
T am I crazy?

439
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:12,241
You make tea out of it.

440
00:12:12,241 --> 00:12:12,821
I believe you can.

441
00:12:12,821 --> 00:12:13,420
Yeah,

442
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:13,840
but it's,

443
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,651
it's actually good.

444
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:15,640
Like as a salad.

445
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:19,440
It's a good tasting green and
pretty fucking good for you to,

446
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:19,930
hmm.

447
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:20,763
What's not to like,

448
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,690
I don't know how we got
on sandy line business.

449
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,910
Don't know how we got us to the dentist.

450
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:28,630
We've covered a lot of grants
on this Yam and ECO friendly.

451
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:29,561
It makes the world go round.

452
00:12:29,561 --> 00:12:29,920
My friend.
