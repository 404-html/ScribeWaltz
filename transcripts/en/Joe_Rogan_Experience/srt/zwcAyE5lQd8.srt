1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:04,140
Yes.
What's up

2
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:10,160
sturgeon?
Mother Falcons in.

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:12,420
Dude,
you've been on a ride.

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,460
So last time I talked to you,
when was the last time I talked to you?

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:18,790
Wasn't that long ago?
No,

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,700
last time you'd been here here.
Things kind of just something wonky.

7
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,980
It was boomi almost a really good show.
I'm wrong with that.

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,340
Somehow with the headphones might be
just me.

9
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:34,010
Might fucking weed.
Well you ever.

10
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,100
Yeah that sounds better.
Thank you.

11
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:38,100
Which Jamie some fucking effects on that
bitch.

12
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,240
He didn't touch anything.
He was just asking because if February.

13
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,130
So um,
uh,

14
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,700
yeah,
I mean you're blowing the fuck up dude.

15
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:52,170
I have to get this out of the way before
we even start talking.

16
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:56,850
Got It.
It's fascinating to watch was a because

17
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,500
well it's always fascinating to watch
someone who you think is very talented.

18
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,540
Get recognized and I thank you.

19
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,760
Very talented.
So then,

20
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,410
and then becoming friends with you,
it's interesting to talk to you and to

21
00:01:10,411 --> 00:01:14,060
see what it's like.
See me process it all the time.

22
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,830
Probably have some interesting insight I
would imagine.

23
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:18,421
Yeah,
I guess so.

24
00:01:18,421 --> 00:01:19,560
For me,
it was a slow,

25
00:01:19,561 --> 00:01:23,430
one was a slow burn,
took a long time and a lot of different

26
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:25,170
shows till it started getting really
weird.

27
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,740
It was pretty manageable news radio.
Was that.

28
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,460
How long were you out here before that
happened?

29
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,530
I came out here for a show right before
that I was on another show called

30
00:01:34,531 --> 00:01:36,330
hardball.
There's this baseball show,

31
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:37,490
so that was like,
uh,

32
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:42,420
maybe like six months before news radio,
so it wasn't very long.

33
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,780
I came out here specifically for that
hardball show.

34
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,680
One of the things just sort of
opportunities turned into other things,

35
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,870
you know,
the ebbs and flows and comes and goes.

36
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,530
But uh,
the news radio fame was nonexistent.

37
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,460
Like nobody ever recognized me.
Everyone.

38
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:02,510
But you're getting recognized now.
Not Too much man in specific towns where

39
00:02:02,611 --> 00:02:03,600
we do better.
Yeah.

40
00:02:03,601 --> 00:02:06,450
But it's mostly,
you know,

41
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,550
99 percent of the time.
People were really cool.

42
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,380
Yeah.
Isn't that the fact?

43
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,210
Yeah,
that's really what's up.

44
00:02:12,211 --> 00:02:14,600
Ninety nine percent of the time.
People really good.

45
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:19,080
Even the one percent are still cool.
It's just lasts a little too long.

46
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:22,890
I don't know.
It's the outliers.

47
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,860
Know the extreme cases that aren't,
you know,

48
00:02:25,861 --> 00:02:30,861
the one percent of the one percent that
could be a sign in that in the grand

49
00:02:32,161 --> 00:02:34,530
scheme of things,
I don't feel like I've really blown up

50
00:02:34,531 --> 00:02:35,880
that big,
you know what I mean?

51
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:38,220
Like it's,
I feel like I've clawed my way to the

52
00:02:38,221 --> 00:02:40,740
beginning as it were.
That's a good way to look at it.

53
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,930
But it's some.
Well,

54
00:02:42,931 --> 00:02:43,950
I mean,
what's the beginning?

55
00:02:43,951 --> 00:02:45,120
What's the,
what's the,

56
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,270
what's the top?
I don't.

57
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,730
I don't know exactly what I do know is
that there's a lot of people that like

58
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,330
will text me.
Dude,

59
00:02:51,331 --> 00:02:54,770
have you heard a surgical simpson?
Holy Shit now

60
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:00,400
man.
It's A.

61
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:00,400
Although

62
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,170
I guess transitionally has been in the
last couple of years,

63
00:03:05,171 --> 00:03:07,210
three years,
but I've been doing this my whole life,

64
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:11,530
um,
to various levels of thanklessness.

65
00:03:11,531 --> 00:03:13,630
But yeah,
a lot of years in Honky tonks and just

66
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,730
dive bars where you were background
noise.

67
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,980
So I am,
now that I'm older,

68
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,590
I think that's been the best part of it
is I'm,

69
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,030
I'm clear and focused enough and have
enough responsibilities in my life to

70
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,480
where I'm not taking it for granted.
Does it make sense 100 percent trying to

71
00:03:28,481 --> 00:03:33,481
like really use it as the opportunity
that is to do something hopefully bigger

72
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:38,620
than just myself.
So.

73
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,120
Well being a famous singer,
you know,

74
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,070
you,
you affect people and a singer and a

75
00:03:44,071 --> 00:03:46,890
songwriter,
you affect people in a very strange way.

76
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:47,880
You know,
the,

77
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,540
there's like a,
an intense emotion that's um,

78
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,950
that's connected to a song that really
moves you,

79
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,270
you know,
there's this intense connection.

80
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,000
And so,
um,

81
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,740
it's,
I think for someone like you,

82
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,890
like it's great that you've got all this
life experience.

83
00:04:04,891 --> 00:04:06,330
I think that helps so much,
man.

84
00:04:06,331 --> 00:04:08,640
I think if you're a fucking Justin
Bieber type character,

85
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,250
boy,
you're almost guaranteed to be fucked.

86
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,620
Like that kind of scrutiny.
I don't.

87
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:17,670
How old was he when that all started?
Baby Panda,

88
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,310
who he is,
but I couldn't tell you a single song,

89
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,280
but yet I know who he is.
Why is that?

90
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,560
Well,
he's famous as famous as fuck,

91
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,230
but yeah,
the poor guy.

92
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,410
I mean.
Well,

93
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:30,720
yeah,
the poor guy.

94
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,290
Nobody could nobody.
It's easy to judge and sit back and be

95
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:34,621
like,
oh,

96
00:04:34,621 --> 00:04:39,621
you're such a fuck up.
Like the kid has a very rare and unique

97
00:04:40,201 --> 00:04:45,201
perspective on the life experience.
That kid is doing a splendid job.

98
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,920
A splendid.
He's fucking up just enough fucking up a

99
00:04:49,921 --> 00:04:51,510
little bit,
but you know,

100
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:56,810
he's fine in comparison to what a normal
person would be with that kind of insane

101
00:04:57,301 --> 00:04:59,180
breach like that.
It was just what,

102
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,480
what it must be like for him to just try
to go through a group of girls.

103
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:07,290
He just,
he gets attack like dogs.

104
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:10,020
They will fight for him.
The claw at him.

105
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,820
What the fuck man.
That he's only like 19 or something.

106
00:05:14,821 --> 00:05:15,840
Right.
And is he 19?

107
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,200
That's insane.
That's insane.

108
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:23,730
It's got to be so hard to,
to keep your shit together and to have a

109
00:05:23,731 --> 00:05:26,940
balanced perspective because there's
only perspective is one of fame.

110
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,180
So you talking about the Honky tonks and
you know,

111
00:05:30,181 --> 00:05:33,290
when you hear last time you talked about
crazy jobs you had,

112
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,650
like you worked on a train,
right?

113
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:35,520
Yeah.
Yeah.

114
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,950
I mean think about that kind of shit.
Go from that,

115
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:42,540
that kind of shit to where you are now.
You have an earned perspective,

116
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,230
an earned perspective.
Whereas it's still hard to feel like it.

117
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:47,123
When you say earned.

118
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,820
My life's pretty,
pretty cool now,

119
00:05:49,821 --> 00:05:51,520
man.
Like I get to go out and make art for a

120
00:05:51,521 --> 00:05:54,830
living and support my family and,
and play music.

121
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:55,611
Yeah.
No,

122
00:05:55,611 --> 00:05:58,220
it's awesome.
It's kind of dope for sure.

123
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:03,290
It even even that said,
as long as it took to get here and even

124
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:06,910
the last three years we toured our asses
off me like going in circles to kind of

125
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,130
build it organically,
you know,

126
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,620
uh,
feel really proud about that because all

127
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,390
I,
no matter what happens up or down,

128
00:06:13,391 --> 00:06:15,860
like,
and I can feel like I accomplished

129
00:06:15,861 --> 00:06:18,590
something with merit,
but it

130
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:22,760
was,
it beautiful time.

131
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,790
It's a beautiful time for artists,
you know?

132
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:28,160
So we're definitely in a moment.
Yeah,

133
00:06:28,161 --> 00:06:29,360
right.
For sure.

134
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,330
It seems like a moment with music,
a moment with.

135
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,310
It's definitely a moment with stand up
comedy.

136
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:37,070
We all talk about it.
It's like the best time ever for standup

137
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,980
I think contribute.
I'm still getting over.

138
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:44,570
Brian Holtzman,
who was the guy that did the last set

139
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,770
that do that fucking.
I was traumatized.

140
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,600
I was an experienced man.
I can't even tell you because you got

141
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:54,680
motherfuckers didn't tell me what was
coming to sit.

142
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,040
I'm sitting here thinking like I'm
watching this guy bomb harder than

143
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,740
anything I've ever seen.
Like telling people in the audience to

144
00:07:00,741 --> 00:07:04,790
just start fucking.
And he's like truck couldn't take my

145
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,180
eyes off of it.
It's amazing.

146
00:07:06,181 --> 00:07:07,660
It was awesome.
And then after the study is like,

147
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:08,420
yeah,
you know,

148
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,860
like,
Holy Shit.

149
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,860
That was all just geodis yeah,
he's genius.

150
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:18,010
Brian holzman's genius 100 percent.
And he keeps running out of the room

151
00:07:18,081 --> 00:07:21,280
man.
Like literally this takes two were

152
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,110
together,
ran out of the room to get away from

153
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:29,111
this thing happening.
The vial expression of toxic masculinity

154
00:07:29,361 --> 00:07:30,830
on stage.
Yeah.

155
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,640
Brian does the kinison spot,
which is the last spot of the night.

156
00:07:34,641 --> 00:07:37,400
So the last guy on the comedy store,
most pops the comments?

157
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,890
Yeah.
Last Pot at the comedy store.

158
00:07:39,891 --> 00:07:43,190
It just goes on from like,
I guess he gets on probably somewhere

159
00:07:43,191 --> 00:07:45,860
around 1230,
maybe one inch and then he'll,

160
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:49,220
he might go til to.
So he's got a long stretch.

161
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,870
He does whatever he wants.
That's why it's the innocence.

162
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:55,610
How long has he been in this?
But while he's the perfect guy for that

163
00:07:55,611 --> 00:08:00,110
spot and he does it on and off.
He's been there at the store as long as

164
00:08:00,111 --> 00:08:00,740
I have.

165
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,570
He's been there at the store since
[inaudible] 94.

166
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:03,920
I was,
I met him in [inaudible] 94.

167
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,660
Was it always in that room?
Now?

168
00:08:05,661 --> 00:08:08,450
He does the little room to.
That's where I first met him or first

169
00:08:08,451 --> 00:08:10,940
met him.
He was like this promising up and coming

170
00:08:10,941 --> 00:08:15,200
guy that would go on in the smaller room
and um,

171
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,820
you know,
he was like one of the hot up and coming

172
00:08:16,821 --> 00:08:18,500
guys.
But he always kept like a real job.

173
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,360
But he's,
in my opinion,

174
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,100
he's one of the best comics in the
world.

175
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:25,490
He just doesn't get a chance to show it
to people.

176
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:29,120
We've tried to talk about like what
would be the best way to let people know

177
00:08:29,121 --> 00:08:31,550
and I think because he changes his stuff
so much.

178
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:37,480
I think just putting cameras on him
every night filming these Kennison spots

179
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,470
that he does every Friday and Saturday
night.

180
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,650
I tell everybody if you want to see some
comments to tough one because to,

181
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,230
to make people aware,
you know,

182
00:08:45,231 --> 00:08:48,890
to let them know you kind of have to
almost in a way sort of have to give

183
00:08:48,891 --> 00:08:52,190
away what makes it,
what it.

184
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,890
I don't know man.
It doesn't bother me.

185
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,930
I know,
I know and I think it's fucking genius.

186
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,710
I know he's a great guy and it's.
But I mean we're,

187
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,950
we're,
we're kind of beating around the Bush

188
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:05,010
here.
He says obviously ridiculously offensive

189
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,720
thing,
but he doesn't really mean

190
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:11,160
I fucking have always loved that style
of comedy,

191
00:09:11,161 --> 00:09:13,260
you know?
And he's in my opinion and like one of

192
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,180
the best ever at it.
He's a monster.

193
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,600
Just people don't know for whatever,
but they don't know because he never

194
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:21,960
left.
He stayed at the store and that's a spot

195
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,780
he stayed in la and he always kept a
job.

196
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:25,830
He always had a job.
He's a meter,

197
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,680
a meter maid at one point.
Had a bunch of jobs like that kind of

198
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,170
will be Koski type guy.
Exactly.

199
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,840
But you know,
you,

200
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,120
you got to do it all for them.

201
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,270
Like someone's got to come along and do
it all for them better.

202
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,211
Oh really?
Yeah.

203
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:40,190
It was just like,
all right,

204
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,020
let's be casual,
bro Kissed.

205
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:44,860
But uh,
yeah,

206
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,490
I'm in the studio either man really bug
you.

207
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,720
They fuck with me.
It's just not,

208
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:52,320
it's not a natural,
uh,

209
00:09:52,321 --> 00:09:53,640
you're,
you're responding to what you're

210
00:09:53,641 --> 00:09:54,900
hearing.
You're close to the,

211
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,010
you know,
it's good for some people because some

212
00:09:59,011 --> 00:10:03,480
people don't realize how goofy it sounds
when everybody talks over everybody.

213
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,990
I'll give you a three people and they
don't have the ear things while you were

214
00:10:06,991 --> 00:10:09,060
talking about before you.
Yeah.

215
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:13,890
So the fight podcasts we do for people
and we made it mandatory like got to

216
00:10:13,891 --> 00:10:17,730
wear earphones because we were drunk and
stoned and we're talking over each

217
00:10:17,731 --> 00:10:19,380
other.
People with chewing into the mic,

218
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,490
you know,
how bad it sounds,

219
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,320
people eating pickles,
potato chips and pickles into the

220
00:10:25,321 --> 00:10:28,080
fucking microphone and it's just like,
oh my God,

221
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,960
I would get these screaming texts from
people,

222
00:10:30,961 --> 00:10:33,480
stopped chewing into the fucking
microphones.

223
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:38,280
So we had to,
we had to institute the headphones

224
00:10:38,281 --> 00:10:41,630
policy,
but for a gentle conversational,

225
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,970
it's like yourself.
It's very easy to put those aside.

226
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,020
Are you,
um,

227
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,860
like when you were touring like all
those three years when you were going

228
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:55,230
crazy and,
and torn like a maniac,

229
00:10:55,590 --> 00:11:00,360
have you settled that down to more
manageable sort of a schedule?

230
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:01,323
Yeah,
it,

231
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,720
it would have been fine otherwise.
I mean I've always lived out of a bag

232
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:08,681
really,
you know what I mean?

233
00:11:08,681 --> 00:11:10,630
And,
and wanted to be moving all the time.

234
00:11:10,631 --> 00:11:12,970
So like in that regard is kind of ideal,
but it just,

235
00:11:12,971 --> 00:11:15,260
the timing was a little bittersweet.
Right.

236
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:20,370
My son was born about a month after the
last record came out of a,

237
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,800
um,
it was home for that.

238
00:11:23,801 --> 00:11:26,580
And then basically three,
three or four days after he was born,

239
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:31,590
I had to go to Europe for some shows.
And then press started rolling in a word

240
00:11:32,471 --> 00:11:34,720
of mouth and record,
just started selling to,

241
00:11:34,721 --> 00:11:39,721
it's like a movie and my weight and my
wife has a very supportive in our that I

242
00:11:41,141 --> 00:11:45,340
wouldn't have moved to national first
place to do anything without her,

243
00:11:45,341 --> 00:11:46,960
like telling me you can do this,
you know what I mean?

244
00:11:46,961 --> 00:11:48,460
I'd probably still be working for the
railroad.

245
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,740
So,
uh,

246
00:11:49,741 --> 00:11:51,430
when,
when it all kind of came about,

247
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,460
you know,
just basically said,

248
00:11:53,461 --> 00:11:53,740
you know,
we didn't,

249
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,830
we didn't come here and like you do
everything up until this point to not be

250
00:11:56,831 --> 00:12:00,370
able to go and because you have to,
now you have to tour,

251
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,630
right?
Um,

252
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,341
so,
uh,

253
00:12:03,341 --> 00:12:05,080
did in other,
you know,

254
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:09,230
I think missing out what was going on at
home and,

255
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,710
and carrying some sense of guilt maybe
for that,

256
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,960
because even though like in my hair and
my dreams are coming true,

257
00:12:13,961 --> 00:12:17,980
it's providing for my family,
but when we come home after five or six

258
00:12:17,981 --> 00:12:20,590
weeks and then I've got a week at home
before leaving again,

259
00:12:20,591 --> 00:12:22,870
I'm just kind of see.
I was seeing what I was missing and

260
00:12:22,871 --> 00:12:24,040
incremental stages,
you know,

261
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:29,041
and I think it took a toll on me
emotionally in a way that I wouldn't

262
00:12:29,471 --> 00:12:31,540
have anticipated.
So that's kind of where this record came

263
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:32,374
from.

264
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:37,280
I don't go on that kind of tour,
but when I go away just for a few days,

265
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,230
just for four or five days.
Yeah,

266
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:44,240
it bums me out when you come back home,
this rush of love,

267
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,370
you know,
it's a good way to put it.

268
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,570
It's what it's like.
It's like this new when I come home,

269
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,230
like I just got back from the road.
I was in Boston this weekend.

270
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:58,790
I come home on Sunday and when your kids
run up to you and jump into your arms

271
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:00,620
and you're carrying them and talking to
them,

272
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:01,910
you know,
it's like,

273
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:06,910
it's very hard to describe for anybody
that doesn't have any children or

274
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,750
doesn't have close friends with
children.

275
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,500
It's very hard to describe.
It's a fucking game changer.

276
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:16,550
Game Changer.
It changes who you are instantly.

277
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,470
Yeah.
You just different thing.

278
00:13:18,471 --> 00:13:23,471
You're a different perspective on the
world is so different and I don't think

279
00:13:23,601 --> 00:13:24,434
it's mandatory.

280
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,160
I think this is important to say because
man,

281
00:13:27,161 --> 00:13:32,161
I used to bum me the fuck out when
people who were fathers or mothers would

282
00:13:33,171 --> 00:13:36,560
treat you like you were doing something
wrong because you didn't have kids.

283
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:40,580
There was something wrong with you or
they would tell you that you don't even

284
00:13:40,581 --> 00:13:43,840
know about life until you have kids or
that you know.

285
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,350
Yeah,
it's a perspective enhancer,

286
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,890
but guess what?
A lot of Shit's a purpose.

287
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,980
Perspective.
Enhanced or like you don't have to do

288
00:13:48,981 --> 00:13:50,840
it,
but for me,

289
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,410
because I just hate when people tell
people you know,

290
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:56,600
that it's like this mandatory aspect of
life.

291
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,990
I think you could absolutely have a
fulfilled life and never procreate.

292
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,180
People shouldn't be appearance,
man.

293
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,040
Yeah,
for sure.

294
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,710
Almost every girl I ever dated stay out
of the business.

295
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,800
That's not true.
They changed to man.

296
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,210
I have a buddy of mine.
His ex girlfriend was crazy just off the

297
00:14:17,211 --> 00:14:20,780
charts crazy.
Just wild girls out of her mind,

298
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:24,290
drugs and sex and chaos.
She had a kid.

299
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,150
Bam.
Snapped out of it,

300
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,740
eats healthy,
organic.

301
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,290
She's super mom who wasn't about her
anymore.

302
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,680
It also is about a fresh chance to do
something correct and raise a child

303
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:40,100
would love and and not create someone
like yourself.

304
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,560
It's a,
it's this weird eyeopening thing.

305
00:14:42,561 --> 00:14:45,650
I think for a lot of people when they
realize we're all,

306
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:49,580
their anger comes from where all the oil
comes from not being raised correctly.

307
00:14:49,581 --> 00:14:52,490
That's a giant part of most people's
lives

308
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,850
is what kind of an interaction you have
with the people that love you and if you

309
00:14:55,851 --> 00:15:00,851
get programmed like real early on,
that love means hitting and screaming

310
00:15:01,131 --> 00:15:06,131
and chaos and yelling and fighting to.
By the time when I was a kid,

311
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:08,420
man,
I used to look about marriage,

312
00:15:08,421 --> 00:15:11,960
like somebody wanted a serve me plates
of shit for the rest of my life.

313
00:15:11,961 --> 00:15:14,000
Like what?
Like why would you do it?

314
00:15:14,001 --> 00:15:16,760
Because what I grew up with was just
chaos.

315
00:15:16,761 --> 00:15:20,600
I grew up with people yelling at each
other and hitting each other and ah,

316
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:23,360
fuck this.
And you don't realize.

317
00:15:23,361 --> 00:15:27,110
I think until you have a little baby
that you're watching,

318
00:15:27,111 --> 00:15:29,840
learn and develop and you sort of data
crunching all this shit,

319
00:15:29,841 --> 00:15:33,530
all these events in this child's life
and you're experiencing all this with

320
00:15:33,531 --> 00:15:37,930
them and we're experiencing with them as
this intense bond of,

321
00:15:37,931 --> 00:15:39,500
of,
of love,

322
00:15:39,501 --> 00:15:43,790
but have also have guidance so you have
to guide this little person and so while

323
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:47,660
I'm doing that and just little moments
and events in my daughters' lives,

324
00:15:47,661 --> 00:15:51,320
little conversations that we have that
make me sort of process how they view

325
00:15:51,321 --> 00:15:56,321
the world and how they think about
things that has made me just so much

326
00:15:56,991 --> 00:16:00,160
more aware of where a lot of my own

327
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:05,220
weird personality quirks have come from.
It's like looking into your own eyes so

328
00:16:06,191 --> 00:16:07,070
you're seeing,
you know,

329
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,440
everything is instantly recognizable.
It's a.

330
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,500
But yeah,
that's a good one.

331
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:16,420
How would you say,
you said the seeing their perspective,

332
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:20,590
but they're just mirroring whatever
you're doing it because they don't hide

333
00:16:20,591 --> 00:16:21,424
things.

334
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:23,340
Yeah.
They don't hide emotions.

335
00:16:23,341 --> 00:16:26,970
They don't hide thoughts and if you can
open up lines of communication with them

336
00:16:26,971 --> 00:16:31,640
really young and get them constantly
used to talking about feelings and about

337
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,530
thoughts and about why do you get those
feelings?

338
00:16:34,531 --> 00:16:35,880
Like what,
you know,

339
00:16:35,881 --> 00:16:38,820
they'll get jealous of each other.
Why does she get a new and why do you

340
00:16:38,821 --> 00:16:40,050
care?
She has a new tour.

341
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:43,620
Like why does that bother you if
somebody else has something good and you

342
00:16:43,621 --> 00:16:45,540
see the little brain going,
oh yeah,

343
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,960
because this is like animal fucking
instinct that makes you want to get

344
00:16:48,961 --> 00:16:51,540
upset about something and you're like,
what?

345
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,460
Her friend gave her a tour.
Where's my shit?

346
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:54,630
You know?
And you gotta like,

347
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:55,051
Whoa,
Whoa,

348
00:16:55,051 --> 00:16:55,680
Whoa,
whoa.

349
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,470
You were happy until you found out that
something good happened to someone you

350
00:16:58,471 --> 00:17:00,270
love.
That doesn't make any sense.

351
00:17:00,271 --> 00:17:02,820
Now does it be like,
oh yeah,

352
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:06,330
you could see the little fucking tiny,
tiny brain spinning on her

353
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,180
just starting to talk.
So we'll get there.

354
00:17:09,181 --> 00:17:12,810
But now it's like trip.
We really like playing drums together.

355
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,960
That's awesome.
When he's talking to you,

356
00:17:18,961 --> 00:17:20,970
is it freak you out?
It's happening right now.

357
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,280
Gosh,
it was there for awhile,

358
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:26,880
there was this little period was like 10
words every day and you don't even know

359
00:17:26,881 --> 00:17:29,160
they're picking them up until they say
them and they'll look,

360
00:17:29,161 --> 00:17:31,740
you know,
look at something and say it and you

361
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:34,320
know,
you haven't had this lesson yet.

362
00:17:34,321 --> 00:17:35,310
And it's like,
wow,

363
00:17:35,311 --> 00:17:38,620
man,
for someone to express emotions and,

364
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,070
and uh,
or even to see them

365
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,750
at such a young age and understanding
how to manipulate situations.

366
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,900
That's really interesting.
Social dynamic.

367
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,020
You're worried

368
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,640
like a primitive game of chess.
A little primitive child.

369
00:17:53,641 --> 00:17:58,641
Chess,
my daughter was three and we were skiing

370
00:17:59,851 --> 00:18:03,780
and she was packing her stuff up and uh,
she didn't have her helmet or suitcase,

371
00:18:03,781 --> 00:18:07,080
so she had her suitcase closed and then
my wife goes,

372
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,680
hey,
you forgot your pr,

373
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:09,710
your helmet.
And she goes,

374
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:14,640
Shit.
She was three when a three year old goes

375
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,370
shit,
like a nice long one.

376
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,750
Just how to say it.
I had a bite my hand to keep from

377
00:18:21,751 --> 00:18:23,030
laughing.
I mean,

378
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:27,210
I try to encourage like stuff that's
funny as much as possible,

379
00:18:27,211 --> 00:18:30,020
but he can encourage him swearing
because they don't,

380
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,940
they don't have the self control to like
shut it off and they go to school.

381
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:37,410
You don't want to be the parents.
They teach the kids.

382
00:18:37,411 --> 00:18:39,210
It's where on that,
but it is fine.

383
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:44,240
It really is the fuck are we doing is
restricting the use of words to

384
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:48,150
children.
Let's about over to the PC thing.

385
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,880
Oh my God.
It's driving me fucking bananas.

386
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:56,490
But this one is just fucking crazy.
So it just so crazy.

387
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:57,990
Why swears

388
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:06,530
just seemed so strange.
Like doesn't seem to be an issue most

389
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,420
anywhere else in the world.
You Go.

390
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:11,420
Well,
for adults in business,

391
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:15,920
I kind of understand that using them
formalities for formalities mean if you

392
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:19,870
want to know it is a lazy form of
linguistics though mean.

393
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:21,350
Sure if you're just.
But Hey,

394
00:19:21,351 --> 00:19:24,380
it feels good so.
Well it can be lazy,

395
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:27,860
but it's like everything else.
I think it's stress related,

396
00:19:27,861 --> 00:19:29,300
honestly.
Man swearing.

397
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:32,360
I think it really.
I think it comes from anxieties and

398
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:36,890
stress induced a variable variables.
I remember like in the navy,

399
00:19:36,891 --> 00:19:38,000
it's fuck this,
fuck that,

400
00:19:38,001 --> 00:19:40,500
fuck every other word,
and when I worked at the railroad was

401
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:44,270
salty language out there image because
you're under this like highly efficient

402
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:48,800
expectation all the time and there's all
these creative personalities and ideas

403
00:19:48,801 --> 00:19:50,960
bouncing off each other.
He's a little confined spaces and

404
00:19:50,961 --> 00:19:53,510
everybody's just wound tighter advantage
of the string.

405
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:54,791
It could be used.
Again,

406
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:55,820
gay always though,
right?

407
00:19:55,821 --> 00:20:00,821
It can also use as like a pause.
Sometimes people use use it in place of

408
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,800
a meter tool.
Well,

409
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,500
you know,
sometimes people don't know what they're

410
00:20:06,501 --> 00:20:08,470
gonna say next and they say,
ah,

411
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:13,040
but instead they're replacing with fuck
like fucking fucking guy with his

412
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,550
fucking.
I'm fucking sitting there,

413
00:20:15,551 --> 00:20:16,740
right?
I'm fucking talking to us,

414
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:17,900
you know,
like that kind of.

415
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:22,460
That's where it gets real lazy.
That's what most people don't even

416
00:20:22,461 --> 00:20:24,500
realize.
Like the weird ticks they have.

417
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:27,140
I didn't realize how many times I'd say,
you know,

418
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,000
or you know what I mean.
Or,

419
00:20:29,001 --> 00:20:33,770
or like the word like,
like isn't fucking dangerous one because

420
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:36,860
you could be talking to someone and not
pick it up.

421
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,590
But then once you do pick it up,
you,

422
00:20:38,591 --> 00:20:42,380
it's all here,
it's all you hear like people have that

423
00:20:42,381 --> 00:20:46,010
little and we're roadblock and they have
a blind side.

424
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:48,070
They didn't see it a blind spot and they
just say like

425
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:53,070
all the time.
It's terrifying because it might be me.

426
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:58,220
I definitely have been.
Tommy has got a bad score.

427
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,420
Has got it bad.
He's got it bad.

428
00:21:00,421 --> 00:21:03,840
He's a like a hawk.
He loves the hymns it up a little bit.

429
00:21:03,841 --> 00:21:06,630
But like in that video he did in
Cleveland this weekend.

430
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,860
Did you see that?
I didn't see that.

431
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,680
That's really funny.
Was it him in Hannibal burress?

432
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,011
No,
no,

433
00:21:11,011 --> 00:21:12,900
no.
He was on a news.

434
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:15,410
Was playing that character.
Yeah.

435
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,253
I did see that.

436
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,970
Our friend Thompson girl was in this
morning show.

437
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,190
He ever do those.
Do you have to do those morning shows?

438
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,500
I don't do.
My career will suffer to some degree

439
00:21:27,501 --> 00:21:28,640
with cause of it,
but man,

440
00:21:28,641 --> 00:21:30,230
I just,
I would,

441
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:33,280
I would never ask anyone to deal with me
in a situation like that.

442
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:36,440
So it's best just to know what you are.

443
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,080
Yeah.
And accepted.

444
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:41,860
Do you get a hard time for not wanting
to do like certain kinds of press?

445
00:21:41,861 --> 00:21:42,860
Do they give you a hard time?

446
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,280
Not really.
I mean,

447
00:21:44,281 --> 00:21:47,880
I think most of the people who have been
working with for awhile now,

448
00:21:47,881 --> 00:21:50,340
they know who they're dealing with.
Um,

449
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:51,690
and I,
I don't,

450
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:54,180
I don't mind doing the press honestly.
It's just,

451
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,240
it's a,
at a certain point it becomes I think

452
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:04,320
counterproductive or even destructive
because it's,

453
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,310
you don't know,
you just repeating things a lot to the

454
00:22:08,311 --> 00:22:11,430
point that you're asked the same
question so many times that without even

455
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:14,460
realizing you find yourself giving
verbatim answers.

456
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:19,700
Whereas when you know it's time to stop
talking about it because it's a like,

457
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,920
like I said,
the more I feel like I talk about it,

458
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:28,530
you sort of denying people their a
better chance to interpret in a way

459
00:22:28,531 --> 00:22:32,520
that's going to make it mean even more
to them in the hero in a way that maybe

460
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,910
I didn't even mean it.
Does the,

461
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:38,130
your memories become weird to you and
talk about them all the time too.

462
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:42,030
When you talk about certain things and
you repeat yourself over and over again,

463
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,100
it does.
It almost becomes a script to you,

464
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,160
like the memories get weird.
I realized,

465
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,473
you know,
like I said,

466
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,120
I've been playing music forever,
but all this other stuff was very sudden

467
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:54,980
transition,
but being a skeptical,

468
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:58,800
naturally skeptical person and self
aware like you get in these situations

469
00:22:58,801 --> 00:23:01,350
and I sort of realized there's a certain
theatrical to it all,

470
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:04,770
you know what I mean,
and and then once you get past the

471
00:23:04,771 --> 00:23:08,910
reality of that and then you,
you learn enough about it to know that

472
00:23:08,911 --> 00:23:12,120
you can sit and talk for three hours
literally,

473
00:23:12,121 --> 00:23:15,120
but it's not a representation of what
you talked about.

474
00:23:15,121 --> 00:23:17,970
You can talk about everything under the
sun and they might take one little

475
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:22,110
sentence that had nothing to do with
anything and an editor decides that that

476
00:23:22,111 --> 00:23:27,111
should be the title of the article that
has now written from some preconceived

477
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:29,700
stance that you did.
You were unaware of during the

478
00:23:29,701 --> 00:23:31,020
conversation.
You know what I mean?

479
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:34,900
It's like
word is especially problematic.

480
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,000
Print context

481
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:40,040
can't print context and it's literally
someone's interpretation.

482
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:43,010
It's art.
That's interpreting an individual,

483
00:23:43,011 --> 00:23:46,670
so if someone writes a story about you,
it's really art because it's their own

484
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:50,030
way of flavoring.
This whole interaction they try to do

485
00:23:50,031 --> 00:23:55,031
with colorful descriptives and they try
to use bold adjectives and try to figure

486
00:23:56,091 --> 00:24:01,091
out a way to paint it in the most
entertaining way as well as get some

487
00:24:01,161 --> 00:24:04,460
point across.
So I think sometimes a lot of guys are

488
00:24:04,461 --> 00:24:06,460
also just trying to get you to click on
their website.

489
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,370
Yep.
That true.

490
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:10,280
But the way to do that is with a good
entertainment.

491
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:15,650
So it doesn't necessarily have to be an
actual factual representation of who you

492
00:24:15,651 --> 00:24:17,450
are.
Like if someone writes a story about

493
00:24:17,451 --> 00:24:20,690
you,
like what's almost more important is

494
00:24:20,691 --> 00:24:25,670
this art of getting something salacious
is art of writing something,

495
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,560
something that makes you say,
oh,

496
00:24:27,561 --> 00:24:30,320
this guy's wild or this guy's,
you know,

497
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:34,470
it has to be like this one thing.
Sturgill Simpson first fucked up man

498
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,560
when he was 14,
you know,

499
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:38,060
you know what I mean?
Like something like first sentence,

500
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:39,110
like,
Hey Jesus,

501
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:41,600
what the fuck is this article going?
You know,

502
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:44,090
not really,
but he would have you believe that you

503
00:24:44,091 --> 00:24:45,950
know,
and the enemy like it starts.

504
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:47,250
I,
I,

505
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:51,620
I didn't realize it until it's,
when you meet people on the street and

506
00:24:51,621 --> 00:24:56,621
you realize they have these crazy,
misinformed ideas about who you are and

507
00:24:57,081 --> 00:25:00,710
what you represent and like
what you are.

508
00:25:00,711 --> 00:25:03,050
I mean,
you know those,

509
00:25:03,051 --> 00:25:04,160
those,
a good lesson learned.

510
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,180
Yeah.
That's a good lesson for anybody.

511
00:25:06,181 --> 00:25:08,480
She would just kind of a dork.
And what's that?

512
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:10,540
It's really just like a dork and you,
but you're like,

513
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:13,640
this is outlaw tough guy.
Like,

514
00:25:13,641 --> 00:25:14,960
you know,
fucking dirt.

515
00:25:14,961 --> 00:25:17,570
The dirt.
That's what they think.

516
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,730
I don't know.
Some of them,

517
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:21,920
some of them probably do.
We're always looking for that though,

518
00:25:21,921 --> 00:25:26,090
right?
I think for the outlaw country guy seems

519
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:26,924
to be the case.

520
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,070
Yeah.
Like that was the shooter had a song

521
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:32,620
making fun of all these,
like fake outlaws.

522
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,450
They have all that shit to his dad did
well.

523
00:25:37,451 --> 00:25:40,000
His Dad was the real thing.
You know,

524
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:45,010
it's got to be hard to look at some fake
outlaws with designer scratches in their

525
00:25:45,281 --> 00:25:47,230
genes.
Like they got attacked by a fucking

526
00:25:47,231 --> 00:25:48,840
leopard or some shit.
I mean,

527
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:53,050
that looks so stupid.
And when your dad is fucking waylon

528
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:56,270
jennings,
that's got to be even more offensive.

529
00:25:56,271 --> 00:25:57,200
Okay.
Imagine man,

530
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,110
you know,
and they see these guys with a hat that

531
00:25:59,111 --> 00:26:01,630
they just got 15 minutes for.
They went on stage,

532
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:05,670
someone handed so placed it perfectly
and someone's doing their hair and

533
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,970
checking in and making sure everything's
good.

534
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,890
Then they send them out there to be an
outlaw

535
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:15,250
sober on adderall.
Probably Beta blockers.

536
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:22,980
It's something that I couldn't,
I couldn't possibly describe to you how

537
00:26:23,091 --> 00:26:25,790
little I pay attention to it.
Yeah.

538
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:29,990
To cut to a country or to music in
general country.

539
00:26:29,991 --> 00:26:34,160
But even anymore I don't really listen
to module one on

540
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:37,050
you.
Are you buddies with that Guy Jason?

541
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:38,850
Who is bill?
Yeah,

542
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,730
that's the right way to say it dude.
I just got into him a couple of weeks

543
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:42,240
ago.
Genius.

544
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,010
Fantastic.
I listened to

545
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:44,843
that.
Uh,

546
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:48,540
his most recent album,
like the entire time I was in Mexico,

547
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:51,240
I was in Mexico for like a week or just
list him the entire time.

548
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,850
Yeah.
We use a jason please.

549
00:26:53,851 --> 00:26:56,370
Some shows together.
Good dude man.

550
00:26:56,371 --> 00:26:56,850
Good,
good.

551
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:58,650
You should have him on a podcast.
I would love to.

552
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,390
Interesting.
Seems a smart dude.

553
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:03,390
Great writer.
Oh yeah,

554
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,630
he's Kinda the guy.
Yeah.

555
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:08,340
Oh my God.
I mean the lyrics credible,

556
00:27:08,341 --> 00:27:11,960
intense.
Just so really well structured too.

557
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,180
That's the other thing about this job
is,

558
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,500
you know,
you meet people that you hit it off with

559
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,450
but you never hang out because you're
never at home.

560
00:27:18,451 --> 00:27:20,840
So we've was trying for like two years
to take our wives.

561
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,780
It's one of the other.
You either on tour or somebody back or.

562
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:28,650
I know exactly what it's like.
I know exactly what it's like a

563
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:30,210
comedian's.
We worked together a lot.

564
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:33,540
That's how we do it.
We also worked together at the store.

565
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:35,490
That's why the store is like a great
base.

566
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,190
It's like home base,
so everybody goes to the store so we

567
00:27:38,191 --> 00:27:41,070
meet each other in the store during the
weeknights and then a lot of times on

568
00:27:41,071 --> 00:27:44,430
the weekends we'll work together.
So like if we do big theater shows,

569
00:27:44,431 --> 00:27:47,700
especially
you think you're down there,

570
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:51,690
the store,
I'm at least to always at least two.

571
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:52,830
Just working.
Yeah,

572
00:27:52,831 --> 00:27:55,380
it depends on how many nights I'm in
town,

573
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,330
you know,
but it's,

574
00:27:56,331 --> 00:27:59,880
it's convenient for me because my spots
are always after 10 so my kids are

575
00:27:59,881 --> 00:28:03,180
already asleep so I can,
I can jet out after I put them to bed,

576
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,080
I can get,
you know,

577
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,440
they go to bed at like eight.
So I'm gone.

578
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,760
You know,
it's perfect.

579
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,990
And it's also like for,
for anybody who does the road a lot,

580
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,410
it's a nice wake up call,
you know,

581
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,600
like you just see these animals going up
in there.

582
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,010
You know Chris rock show up working on
his Oscars.

583
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,370
He showed up that Saturday night.
We.

584
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:23,221
That's right.
Yeah,

585
00:28:23,221 --> 00:28:24,300
that's right.
That's right.

586
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,990
Chappelle shows up all the time.
Louis shows up all the time.

587
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:31,100
Bill burrs there all the time.
I mean just all the assessment up and

588
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:34,500
testing out new stuff or are keeping
their chops up,

589
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,360
chat,
testing out new stuff.

590
00:28:36,361 --> 00:28:38,550
All the above.
Just working,

591
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:42,070
you know,
it's like they're at everyone's act as

592
00:28:42,071 --> 00:28:44,030
sort of like a work of progress,
you know,

593
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,990
and when you're close to them and you
watch it from,

594
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:48,240
they'd be like,
like Joey Diaz who I think is the

595
00:28:48,241 --> 00:28:50,580
funniest guy of all time.
He's the funniest guy ever.

596
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,890
Never,
never laughed harder than watching him.

597
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,510
But I watch his bits,
uh,

598
00:28:54,511 --> 00:28:57,810
watch them develop like a because I'm
working with them all the time.

599
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:00,960
That's some of the more interesting
things about.

600
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,230
One of the more interesting things about
being friends with a lot of comedians is

601
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,050
watching all the different styles of
creation,

602
00:29:07,051 --> 00:29:08,820
how they do it,
how they piece it together.

603
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,130
It's just like songwriting.
There's like,

604
00:29:11,131 --> 00:29:13,700
there's no right way to do it.
Yeah Man,

605
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,090
I tell you what,
just to,

606
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:15,990
I've only,
you know,

607
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,850
I'm just now getting to spend any time
out here.

608
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:22,230
Uh,
but there's something about that world

609
00:29:22,231 --> 00:29:24,540
just a couple of times I've gone and
I've spent time in that place.

610
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:29,400
It's a totally different head space than
anything I'm used to or accustomed to.

611
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:32,280
And you can see there's definitely a
sense of community.

612
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:33,660
Oh yeah,
there was a,

613
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,960
a palatable underlying darkness.
Oh yeah.

614
00:29:36,961 --> 00:29:40,230
To at all.
But I think what I liked the most about

615
00:29:40,231 --> 00:29:41,770
it is there's no area,

616
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,780
you know,
for all in all,

617
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:47,620
everybody seems to be pretty black and
white and like real as fuck,

618
00:29:47,621 --> 00:29:50,830
you know,
you can get away with some ridiculous

619
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:54,870
shit on that stage two because it's just
the way it's always been like,

620
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,580
like holtzman without giving any of his
set away.

621
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:01,420
Some of the things that he was saying,
are you like Jesus fucking Christ?

622
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:02,283
Oh Dude,
I was.

623
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:05,830
I mean I know you're enjoying that
because also they're just like,

624
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:11,410
oh shit.
He was particularly on fire that night

625
00:30:11,411 --> 00:30:14,920
too,
like the screaming at people and so what

626
00:30:14,921 --> 00:30:18,160
happens when somebody gets up and just
jumps on the stage and goes for him?

627
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,680
Because it happened before his
girlfriend.

628
00:30:20,681 --> 00:30:22,090
I was just like,
what is happening?

629
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:25,480
Holy Shit.
That was intense.

630
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:28,690
But the people were laughing,
but people have attacked him.

631
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,860
Really?
Yeah.

632
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,660
Martin Lawrence,
his bodyguard.

633
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,650
Ego Self.
I mean I wasn't there.

634
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:39,460
I missed the festivities,
but from what I understand,

635
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:44,380
Martin Lawrence was in the audience and
him and Holtzman like we're going back

636
00:30:44,381 --> 00:30:47,710
and forth and Holtzman went over to the
table to point out that it was actually

637
00:30:47,711 --> 00:30:49,630
Martin Lawrence that he was,
there was,

638
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,080
he was being heckled by Martins
bodyguard,

639
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:53,890
gets up,
punched him in the head and knocked him

640
00:30:53,891 --> 00:30:55,450
out.
That was one time I heard,

641
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:57,550
but there was some other stuff too.
Damn.

642
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:01,720
One time he took a fucking an ashtray.
And Ari was talking about this the other

643
00:31:01,721 --> 00:31:03,340
day.
The comedy store,

644
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:07,120
um,
especially like in the early days had

645
00:31:07,121 --> 00:31:11,670
these thick fucking glass ashtrays,
old school school for Ashtrays.

646
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:14,110
I'm sure many people got murdered with
one of those fucking things.

647
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:19,970
Holtzman was talking about Charlie's
angels and how angry he was that anybody

648
00:31:20,771 --> 00:31:24,070
really believes how a woman could kick
all those meds.

649
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,850
I take already grabs that ashtray.
Oh,

650
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:31,000
fucking crusher had he throws the
Astraea at the table and shatters his

651
00:31:31,001 --> 00:31:32,110
fucking ass.
Trey.

652
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,980
Holy Fuck.
Yeah.

653
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,380
It's like,
whoa.

654
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:38,470
He blew an ash tray up in the room.
I mean,

655
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:42,850
glass flying all over the fucking place.
I mean,

656
00:31:42,851 --> 00:31:46,090
he really,
through this ashtray down on this table

657
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:49,000
and shattered it.
It was a small crowd,

658
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:54,210
but someone easily could've got hit with
a honker glass that probably that class

659
00:31:54,641 --> 00:31:55,690
probably still on that ground.

660
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,170
He definitely could probably find the
sharp dude,

661
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,840
but he's going for it.
You know what I mean?

662
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:07,190
It's,
it's,

663
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,190
it's one of those things we were talking
about,

664
00:32:09,191 --> 00:32:12,160
like there's,
there's a.

665
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:15,160
When you're writing a song,
I guess it's probably similar to where

666
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,530
you are creating this narrative.
You,

667
00:32:17,531 --> 00:32:18,020
you're,
you're,

668
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:23,020
you're being a separate person maybe
than you are in real life and you're

669
00:32:25,991 --> 00:32:28,510
creating it and you're,
you're seeing it from that person's

670
00:32:28,511 --> 00:32:31,360
perspective.
But when a guy like holtzman is doing

671
00:32:31,361 --> 00:32:33,760
that on stage,
he's doing something similar,

672
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:39,180
but because it's just talking,
people don't accept it as not his

673
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,930
opinion.
You know,

674
00:32:41,931 --> 00:32:44,060
they,
they think that he's just a fucking

675
00:32:44,061 --> 00:32:46,640
asshole and a misogynist and the this
and the that.

676
00:32:46,641 --> 00:32:51,260
And it's not just like he's a character
in a movie that's playing and asshole.

677
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:56,261
That's happened to be hilarious.
Which we accept with no reservation too

678
00:32:56,921 --> 00:32:57,754
weird,
right?

679
00:32:59,030 --> 00:32:59,900
It's A.

680
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:02,870
I don't know.
I was just sitting there,

681
00:33:02,871 --> 00:33:07,130
we're really after the fact and then
looking back on what I just seen how

682
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:10,670
when he's in the moment of playing the
frustrated,

683
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:13,580
you know,
like you have such,

684
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:15,070
you know,
like what's the fucking,

685
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:16,220
what's the point?
And I was like,

686
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:20,870
but it's so he was just so in that it
has to make me feel like a part big part

687
00:33:20,871 --> 00:33:22,940
of.
It's coming from a real place to,

688
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:24,110
you know.
Oh yeah.

689
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:25,460
Oh yeah.
It's just.

690
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,830
I mean he's not carrying that around
with them all the time,

691
00:33:27,831 --> 00:33:29,780
but that's definitely coming from a real
place.

692
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:33,330
He has been about Hillary.
I can't give it away in a way.

693
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,490
Yeah,
for sure.

694
00:33:34,491 --> 00:33:36,090
Definitely.
But he's like,

695
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:39,770
he's a very smart guy.
Obviously he's legitimately frustrated

696
00:33:39,771 --> 00:33:42,260
at the world around him.
You know who isn't,

697
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:46,310
but if you're not,
then you're not paying attention.

698
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:49,160
It's that simple.
In this day and age,

699
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,170
look you.
What we all should try to do,

700
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,490
and I know you agree,
is try to be as harmonious as you can in

701
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:57,260
your life,
in your personal life and your

702
00:33:57,261 --> 00:34:02,261
friendships harmonious as he can.
The problem today is that in this day

703
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,080
and age,
we have access to all the stories,

704
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:09,530
all the stores everywhere.
There's too many of us.

705
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:13,340
That's too much data to crunch.
You're only going to get the shitty ones

706
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:15,620
because it's shitty ones.
The ones that going to hear about

707
00:34:15,621 --> 00:34:16,570
because those are the ones,
you know,

708
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:18,740
Isis cuts baby's head off.
Holy Shit.

709
00:34:18,741 --> 00:34:20,630
The babies scare me,
man.

710
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:23,570
Don't worry about isis and things like
that.

711
00:34:23,571 --> 00:34:27,950
Worry more about natural disasters will
weirdest,

712
00:34:27,951 --> 00:34:31,700
weirdest to say that whatever we talk,
when I get hung up on fault lines and

713
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,180
uh,
you know,

714
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:35,630
the inevitable,
but my wife makes fun of me about it.

715
00:34:35,631 --> 00:34:36,590
But no,
I mean,

716
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,740
I guess a shouldn't be worried about
isis.

717
00:34:39,741 --> 00:34:40,574
But um,
um,

718
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:44,180
I mean hell,
these Neo Nazi

719
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,953
been

720
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:49,200
perspective Zionist group scare me more
than Isis.

721
00:34:49,201 --> 00:34:50,670
You know,
like people like the homegrown ones.

722
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:54,920
This ones actually here in our country
that the Oregon guys a high I don't

723
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:55,800
want.
Well I don't,

724
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:58,080
man.
I watched about two minutes of that and

725
00:34:58,081 --> 00:34:59,400
was just like,
I can't even look at this.

726
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,500
We still never found out who called
them.

727
00:35:01,501 --> 00:35:05,970
Y'All Qaeda,
we believe someone on the show named

728
00:35:05,971 --> 00:35:07,350
them yell,
Kil Kinda.

729
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:10,300
It was either that or was it a comic
that we named them?

730
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:13,800
I saw it a lot of times on Google,
so I don't know where it started,

731
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:17,030
but might not have even started there.
Then the person who said it might've

732
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,840
heard it first.
Either way,

733
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:20,730
what a fucking great name.
Y'All Qaeda.

734
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:22,860
I fuckin love that name.
How did,

735
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:23,723
what did,
what did.

736
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,260
I mean?
I honestly did step away,

737
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:27,630
wouldn't end up happening with all the
um,

738
00:35:27,631 --> 00:35:31,890
one guy got shot and killed and then
there was uh,

739
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:35,190
some guys turned themselves in and uh,
you know,

740
00:35:35,191 --> 00:35:38,290
there was a standoff for a long period
of time had do with grazing

741
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:41,910
and cattle cattle on,
on public land.

742
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:45,120
We call it department of land
management.

743
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:48,380
Dlm is a dlm land.
Is that it?

744
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:49,890
Bureau land management.
Blm,

745
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,113
Blm,
that's it.

746
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:54,900
There's a mountain range and he taught
it would still be on Blm land and a lot

747
00:35:54,901 --> 00:35:59,901
of the hunters for literally 100,
100 year ban on is the Okra,

748
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:03,960
I think Okra,
mountain range and valley.

749
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,720
And they were getting ready to open it
back up after a hundred years.

750
00:36:06,721 --> 00:36:08,430
So they say,
well,

751
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:11,580
most people don't have this and their
country.

752
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:16,170
Most countries don't have a giant swaths
of public land that you can hunt and

753
00:36:16,171 --> 00:36:17,330
fish on.
Right.

754
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,480
That was all because of Teddy Roosevelt.
Teddy Roosevelt faced so much pressure

755
00:36:21,481 --> 00:36:23,910
to not to not do that and to give in to
that,

756
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:27,090
that he wound up leaving.
Was he a Republican or Democrat?

757
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,790
I feel like the Democrats used to be the
more conservative ones back in the day

758
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:36,750
and then the Republicans were the more
open minded and liberal.

759
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:39,780
Then somewhere along the line,
the polar axis is shifted.

760
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,930
That's what I've written.
Read Rather.

761
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,300
Anyway,
Teddy Roosevelt,

762
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:51,020
he deemed all of this land all over the
country as public land.

763
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:53,850
And you,
you could never do anything with it.

764
00:36:53,851 --> 00:36:57,450
You can't.
You can't fucking put cities in it.

765
00:36:57,870 --> 00:37:01,280
You can't do shit with it.
This is just public land and this is

766
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:03,180
land owned by the people of the United
States.

767
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:07,410
And there's been a lot of like really
shady politicians that have looked at

768
00:37:07,411 --> 00:37:11,360
our debt because the United States has
massive debt and they'd said,

769
00:37:11,361 --> 00:37:13,080
look,
this is one way we can get rid of this

770
00:37:13,081 --> 00:37:15,810
debt.
We can sell some of our public land.

771
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,720
I think Paul Ryan,
that guy that's one of the presidential

772
00:37:18,721 --> 00:37:21,390
guys,
think he bowed out of the presidential

773
00:37:21,391 --> 00:37:23,790
election,
but he was one of the guys that was.

774
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:29,100
It was one of his proposals and people,
the outdoors people,

775
00:37:29,101 --> 00:37:31,260
people that hike and hunt and fish.

776
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:34,610
They were going fucking crazy.
Like you can't do this like you can't.

777
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:36,750
But.
But you look at it on CNN,

778
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:40,770
it's like one of the most important
things about what makes this country

779
00:37:40,771 --> 00:37:43,260
amazing is some of our natural
resources,

780
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,160
our parks.
Nothing else like it on the planet to

781
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:46,400
Yosemite.
I mean,

782
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,510
cody,
go to Yosemite if you don't think

783
00:37:48,511 --> 00:37:51,810
there's,
there's some majesty in places in the

784
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:54,030
world,
like almost like a magic land.

785
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:58,050
You look at those mountains and you see
a grizzly bear and you see a herd of

786
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:58,831
Bison.
You're like,

787
00:37:58,831 --> 00:38:00,780
Holy Shit,
like this.

788
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:03,780
What is this?
This is a wild park.

789
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,840
You can go through this park and you
might get eaten by a grizzly.

790
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,860
Go ahead.
Good luck.

791
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:10,200
I mean,
you're in the world where people are

792
00:38:10,201 --> 00:38:14,400
fucking coddled and pampered and every
edge is covered by a thick chunk of

793
00:38:14,401 --> 00:38:15,660
nerf.
Shit gets real.

794
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,650
Dude.
You could walk to yellowstone,

795
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:21,120
to people over the last like five years
had been killed by bears.

796
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:23,400
It happens more than you think.
Yeah,

797
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:24,270
man.
My friend was there.

798
00:38:24,271 --> 00:38:27,420
He heard wolves howl.
He said it was the craziest shit.

799
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,280
He said,
we're in Yosemite near here.

800
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:31,223
You hear it.

801
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:35,000
I was like,
is it like a coyotes game?

802
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:35,990
Know

803
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:38,800
it's a fucking wolf man.
It's different.

804
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:39,701
Bad,
bad,

805
00:38:39,701 --> 00:38:42,490
bad.
Way To go to Roosevelt and yellowstone.

806
00:38:42,491 --> 00:38:44,590
Have you ever been to the ranger station
that.

807
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,750
I think he's the one that had it built
out there,

808
00:38:46,751 --> 00:38:50,830
but it's this like 20 story,
high cabin.

809
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:53,720
There was all these weird.
Wouldn't you can go to them?

810
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,720
I've heard of it,
but I never been amazing.

811
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:59,340
Just a really old,
really old to me over 100 years old with

812
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:01,390
all the forest rangers.
I think.

813
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,310
I hope I'm getting that right,
lived in it,

814
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:06,790
but it's pretty much like the coolest
treehouse you'll ever see anywhere on

815
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:09,190
the planet.
What is big hunting lodge?

816
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,113
Wow.

817
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:12,960
Check it out.
If you're out there,

818
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:15,830
imagine those days man,
when they.

819
00:39:15,831 --> 00:39:17,180
They only,
you know,

820
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:22,190
like we have a pretty clear view from
all the data we've taken in all the

821
00:39:23,131 --> 00:39:26,580
photographs and video and all the
peoples accounts.

822
00:39:26,581 --> 00:39:29,110
We have a clear view of what this
country's like.

823
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,510
You know,
at this point.

824
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:31,740
Yeah.
We know.

825
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:34,530
We know about the drive to Vegas from
La.

826
00:39:34,531 --> 00:39:36,930
We know about going up the coast to Sam.
You know what I'm saying?

827
00:39:36,931 --> 00:39:40,110
We don't.
But in the Teddy Roosevelt days stay

828
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:43,520
where they were still like 50 years into
picture.

829
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:48,330
Undaunted courage.
Their first pictures were in the late 18

830
00:39:48,331 --> 00:39:49,164
hundreds.
Right.

831
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:53,170
So the Teddy Roosevelt age.
I mean this motherfucker was,

832
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:56,520
they barely knew anything.
No the fuck.

833
00:39:56,521 --> 00:39:56,931
Did they.
How?

834
00:39:56,931 --> 00:40:00,900
What year was Roosevelt President?
Early 19 hundreds.

835
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,850
Nine.
So think about that.

836
00:40:02,851 --> 00:40:06,270
They'd only had pictures for like what,
50 or 60 years.

837
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,390
How many pictures of their,
of their,

838
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:13,460
of yellowstone or of the Colorado
rockies are all the different types of

839
00:40:13,681 --> 00:40:16,230
wildlife you're going to run into about
a wolverine.

840
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:19,950
You got a photo of a wolverine,
yet I just stumbled across that fucking

841
00:40:19,951 --> 00:40:22,440
thing for the first time going,
Jesus,

842
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:25,290
what is that?
Fuck,

843
00:40:25,291 --> 00:40:27,900
man.
I was watching this video the other day

844
00:40:27,901 --> 00:40:31,020
with this dude who was driving his
fucking car.

845
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:36,230
He watched a wolf and a c and a mountain
lion fighting to the death there would

846
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,770
duke it out right in front of him and he
stopped his car and he said they were so

847
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:43,440
close that he could reach out and touch
the wolf.

848
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:47,520
And so he's sitting there in his car
while there's wolf and this mount line

849
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:52,020
or fucking engaged in mortal combat.
I'm cool,

850
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,770
I'm good.
Whatever,

851
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:58,470
but what a crazy trip that would be to
see that.

852
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,760
And you know,
if you were in the teddy rose,

853
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,180
if I knew they weren't coming through
the windshield.

854
00:41:04,181 --> 00:41:05,050
Yeah,
go see that.

855
00:41:05,051 --> 00:41:06,870
But I mean I'm getting out of the car.
I don't know.

856
00:41:06,871 --> 00:41:08,570
Yeah,
we drove through yellowstone every time.

857
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:11,000
It never fails if there is a grizzly
citing.

858
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:13,330
Yeah,
you get there and there's like 20

859
00:41:13,331 --> 00:41:16,480
carloads of people standing out on the
street with their cameras out and

860
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,630
arranger standards saying,
please get back in your car.

861
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,100
You're,
you know,

862
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:23,010
you're entering the food chain.
The guy was so sardonic about it.

863
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,910
It was just like,
this is amazing.

864
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,430
This is it right here.
This is the video.

865
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,810
This is the wolf

866
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,750
and the,
the mountain lions.

867
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,260
The wolf by the neck.
Wow.

868
00:41:32,261 --> 00:41:34,070
The mountain lion jacked him.
That is

869
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:37,580
crazy.
Look at the mountain lion winning.

870
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,760
I think I'd rather get eaten by a great
white shark and taken out by a cougar

871
00:41:40,761 --> 00:41:42,800
man because it's going to play with you
like a ball of yarn.

872
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:43,910
Back it up,
Jamie,

873
00:41:43,911 --> 00:41:45,800
because before that you actually see
them.

874
00:41:45,801 --> 00:41:47,750
Duke it out before the mountain lion
wins.

875
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:53,370
My uh,
a friend of mine is a guide.

876
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:57,210
He's a hunting guide in Colorado.
Look at this battle that mountain lion

877
00:41:57,211 --> 00:41:59,640
just clamps down on his neck at Wolf's
trying,

878
00:41:59,641 --> 00:42:01,440
but it ain't working out.
Dude.

879
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,750
The amount line and letting go.
Fuck.

880
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:08,800
Did you say that video of the panther,
the lady caught on video running panther

881
00:42:08,801 --> 00:42:11,620
brand by brand by her?
Yeah.

882
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:13,240
That's in Florida.

883
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,930
Was hiking on antelope island one time
and uh,

884
00:42:18,931 --> 00:42:22,340
just north of Utah and they have this
big buffalo reserve out there.

885
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,900
It's like a public peak probably six
out.

886
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,310
No,
they height in a.

887
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:29,460
But there's all these free range in
buffalo were on the island,

888
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:32,760
you know,
it's coming back down the hill.

889
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:36,030
Me and my buddy and as we were hiking
down a trail,

890
00:42:36,031 --> 00:42:37,350
you know,
about 300 yards down,

891
00:42:37,351 --> 00:42:39,330
I can see there's a couple of buffalo
right on,

892
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,770
right on the trail,
on the footpath.

893
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,390
And we're like,
that's right.

894
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:45,270
They'll,
they'll be moved on by the time we get

895
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:46,450
there.
And when we come down the hill,

896
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,970
come around this big boulder and sure
shit,

897
00:42:47,971 --> 00:42:50,040
they're still standing there.
And I,

898
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:51,870
you know,
my uncle had a farm.

899
00:42:51,871 --> 00:42:53,850
He had cows.
I never been around a damn buffalo.

900
00:42:53,851 --> 00:42:56,970
I don't know the difference in suddenly,
well they'll move.

901
00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:58,350
It's just a big ass cow,
you know,

902
00:42:58,351 --> 00:43:00,990
so we just keep walking towards him
buddy.

903
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,620
He jumps up on a rock and he's just
laughing at me like a dumb ass because

904
00:43:04,621 --> 00:43:07,990
I'm standing there at this point,
this thing is 15 feet in front of God

905
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,600
and it was grazing like sideways was his
hip towards me and he's just eaten.

906
00:43:12,601 --> 00:43:15,000
And finally he looks up and turns his
head and looked at me,

907
00:43:15,001 --> 00:43:16,830
man.
And I realized,

908
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:20,250
Holy Shit,
that was like the size of a Volkswagen

909
00:43:20,251 --> 00:43:21,520
beetle man.
Oh my God.

910
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:25,500
He's just looking at me.
I'm thinking this is some dumb shit.

911
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:28,050
Like,
what am I doing?

912
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:29,400
You know,
what do I do?

913
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:35,100
And that's a different buffalo buddy.
That's a water buffalo animals school.

914
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:37,290
There you go.
Top is the bison.

915
00:43:37,291 --> 00:43:37,750
Yeah.
Yeah.

916
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:40,110
That's so wild.
He just turns and looks at me and I'm

917
00:43:40,111 --> 00:43:40,621
like,
Oh,

918
00:43:40,621 --> 00:43:41,670
I'm so fucked.

919
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,370
And uh,
I didn't know what else to do.

920
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:49,140
That thing took one more step forward
towards him.

921
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,240
I don't know what else to do because
we're looking at,

922
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,640
we were making and I just kinda like
took.

923
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:55,110
I didn't know,
like he's going to charge me.

924
00:43:55,111 --> 00:43:57,720
I'm either running or what.
So I took one more step.

925
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:01,350
And you just kinda like often and him
and his buddy ran,

926
00:44:01,351 --> 00:44:05,220
but when he started running me like the
whole ground shook and I remember

927
00:44:05,221 --> 00:44:07,500
standing there looking at my friend
thinking like,

928
00:44:07,501 --> 00:44:09,790
that could've been really bad.
Oh yeah,

929
00:44:09,810 --> 00:44:11,870
you could be dead.
No stairs steps.

930
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:14,490
But there's.
But it's open to the public and out

931
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:15,990
there all the time is buffalo
everywhere.

932
00:44:15,991 --> 00:44:18,600
So that's.
How's that a winning combination?

933
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:21,540
I like it.
I do.

934
00:44:21,541 --> 00:44:24,450
I like it way better than I liked the
idea of a zinsser nature.

935
00:44:24,451 --> 00:44:26,970
At your own risk.
I think you should enter nature at your

936
00:44:26,971 --> 00:44:29,040
own risk.
And I think nature should be natural.

937
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:30,180
You're a big bow hunter,
right?

938
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:31,103
Yeah.
Okay.

939
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:32,280
We'd

940
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:35,110
started to talk was a dinner,
but I moved.

941
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:36,910
Remain his shit.
You know,

942
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:40,230
you shoot an Arrow and an elks ass and
it doesn't kill it.

943
00:44:40,231 --> 00:44:43,260
You just piss it off and now you're 40
yards away from this thing.

944
00:44:43,261 --> 00:44:44,610
What do you do?
Well,

945
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:48,480
most importantly,
you got to practice like before,

946
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:49,980
especially if you're gonna shoot an
Arrow,

947
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:52,020
you,
I practice every day.

948
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:53,470
Really?
Every day,

949
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,820
every day I go somewhere and I shoot
arrows.

950
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:57,630
Something you should probably take
seriously,

951
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:00,540
you've got to take it so it's not like a
rifle thing.

952
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,280
No.
See a rifle thing is,

953
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:07,020
it's all just about understanding how to
use the scope and understanding trigger

954
00:45:07,021 --> 00:45:09,390
discipline.
You got to understand how to squeeze the

955
00:45:09,391 --> 00:45:14,391
trigger and not pull it,
but archery involves a lot of weird hand

956
00:45:14,701 --> 00:45:18,240
eye coordination and balance.
There's so many different factors going

957
00:45:18,241 --> 00:45:19,980
on.
There's like a little site that you have

958
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:24,000
and you have to balance that site out
where the bubble is in the center.

959
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:26,460
You know the level brutal.
You got to make sure that you're not

960
00:45:26,461 --> 00:45:28,520
torquing your go left or right.
You gotta.

961
00:45:28,521 --> 00:45:33,390
Make sure that the peep peep site though
the the little string hold that you're

962
00:45:33,391 --> 00:45:36,480
looking through lines up and eclipses
perfectly.

963
00:45:36,481 --> 00:45:39,150
Your housing,
you have to make sure that your hand is

964
00:45:39,151 --> 00:45:42,240
completely steady.
You got to make sure you don't flinch at

965
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:45,210
all when you release the arrow.
There's so much going on.

966
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:50,360
Any micro movement can add up to several
feet left or right when it gets down

967
00:45:51,391 --> 00:45:54,000
past like 40 and fall.
He was trying to control

968
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,090
your attended.
You know,

969
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,890
target on the moving creature.
Yeah.

970
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:03,810
Moving creature and you have to make.
You have to be good enough to make an

971
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,220
ethical shot.
Right?

972
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:06,930
You know,
you have to be good enough to,

973
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:11,040
you know,
and it's not easy man.

974
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:12,180
It's not fucking easy.

975
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:15,150
So that's the most important thing.
It's like there's a lot of guys that

976
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:17,790
shouldn't be doing it because they're
doing it.

977
00:46:17,791 --> 00:46:21,870
And I was gonna say all that said,
when shit goes wrong in what you do.

978
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:25,320
Well,
you have to have a plan,

979
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:26,341
right?
If you,

980
00:46:26,341 --> 00:46:29,790
if you shoot an animal and a charge that
you got to have a tree near you or

981
00:46:29,791 --> 00:46:31,440
something where you can get behind the
tree,

982
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:33,990
you know,
but you've got to assume that if you hit

983
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:36,810
an animal with an Arrow,
the last thing wants to do is charge

984
00:46:36,811 --> 00:46:38,190
you.
Unless it's a predator.

985
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:41,130
Predator's might charge you.
Like if you the real.

986
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,980
There's a real possibility that if you
hit a bear,

987
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:46,230
although I know people that have hit a
moose,

988
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:49,420
my friend written Ella got run over by a
moose.

989
00:46:49,421 --> 00:46:54,180
He shot it with a rifle and went to move
in for the final shot of the thing was

990
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,230
much better shape than he thought it was
and it got up and charged him and

991
00:46:58,231 --> 00:46:59,064
knocked him over.

992
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:03,990
Yeah,
and I seen another guy who shot a moose

993
00:47:03,991 --> 00:47:08,430
with a bow and the most charged them,
but most of the time they want to get

994
00:47:08,431 --> 00:47:10,500
the fuck away from me.
But again,

995
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:14,400
it's not safe.
It's not supposed to be,

996
00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:16,830
but it's real.
I mean,

997
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:20,820
if you are hunting an elk and you kill
an elk with a bow and Arrow,

998
00:47:20,821 --> 00:47:22,800
you fucking killed an elk with a bow and
arrow.

999
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:24,860
It is real.
It is 100 percent.

1000
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:27,810
That is a real elk.
It's a wild fucking animal that doesn't

1001
00:47:27,811 --> 00:47:28,950
have any rule book.
There's no.

1002
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:31,690
There is no act break.
There's no commercial time.

1003
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:35,200
It's a.
that's a real 1000 pound wild horse with

1004
00:47:35,201 --> 00:47:38,110
a tree growing out of his fucking head
and it's horny.

1005
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:39,400
It's screaming.

1006
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:45,970
This thing that's 10 times bigger than
you is running up a hill with a tree

1007
00:47:45,971 --> 00:47:48,540
grown out of his head.
You know,

1008
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:50,150
you got to carry it out of there.
Yeah,

1009
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:51,770
we got to cut it up.
Well,

1010
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:53,830
we,
the out that I shot,

1011
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:56,260
luckily we're close enough to get a
truck nearby.

1012
00:47:56,530 --> 00:47:58,670
But uh,
I know guys that have had the camp them

1013
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,740
out,
packed them out.

1014
00:48:00,690 --> 00:48:03,110
Yeah.
Because you know the smell and

1015
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,690
everything.
You're drawing predators at night if you

1016
00:48:04,691 --> 00:48:07,030
have to.
There's got to be real careful but

1017
00:48:07,031 --> 00:48:08,860
wolves to.
I have a friend of mine who's going to

1018
00:48:08,861 --> 00:48:10,870
be on next week,
this Guy John Dudley,

1019
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:15,940
he was in Alberta and they shot an elk
and they got it surrounded by wolves.

1020
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:17,590
The wolves trying to take the elk.

1021
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:20,130
You said it was.
Fuck.

1022
00:48:20,131 --> 00:48:24,300
They killed two wolves like they got.
They got charged by wolves.

1023
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:26,940
Yeah.
It got real weird man.

1024
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:29,250
And he said,
and once they had killed two,

1025
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:33,000
um,
this alpha like hung around the edge of

1026
00:48:33,001 --> 00:48:37,290
this ridge and looked down at them and
just decided enough was enough and just

1027
00:48:37,291 --> 00:48:39,390
went ghost.
And they all disappeared the entire

1028
00:48:39,391 --> 00:48:41,730
pack.
But they were around him howling.

1029
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:45,310
He said he'd get here,
look 12 distinctly different howls

1030
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:48,030
around them and they have an elk on the
ground.

1031
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:52,110
Yeah,
and people,

1032
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:53,250
you know,
people say,

1033
00:48:53,251 --> 00:48:54,150
oh,
he killed a wolf.

1034
00:48:54,151 --> 00:48:57,660
That guy's an asshole.
They kill a lot of wolves up their folks

1035
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:02,250
and you might think that's terrible idea
and that's horrible and it is

1036
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:05,970
if you don't live there,
but if you live there,

1037
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:08,070
fuck.
They have to like,

1038
00:49:08,071 --> 00:49:11,460
you don't understand.
Everybody has this idea,

1039
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,320
and I talk about this way too much.
I'll stop,

1040
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:17,040
but everybody had this idea of predators
to delete some character in a movie that

1041
00:49:17,041 --> 00:49:19,960
knows the script.
They don't man the,

1042
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:21,510
the.
You have to control their fucking

1043
00:49:21,511 --> 00:49:26,010
populations.
They just found 19 dead elk at these

1044
00:49:26,011 --> 00:49:28,470
wolves killed in Wyoming.
They just left them there.

1045
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:33,090
They just want our slaughter fest.
They snuck into this pack of like some

1046
00:49:33,091 --> 00:49:37,170
of those elpacs in Wyoming.
You'll get like a hundred elk now.

1047
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:39,270
They're in its immense.
These huge,

1048
00:49:39,271 --> 00:49:41,760
huge packs of elk.
What'd you call it?

1049
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:43,110
What would you call my herd?
Herd of elk.

1050
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:46,470
And so this wolf pack jumped in there.
Look at,

1051
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:50,760
look at all the elk.
They killed 19 elk and they didn't need

1052
00:49:50,761 --> 00:49:52,500
any of them.
These kills killed them.

1053
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:53,633
Yeah.

1054
00:49:55,610 --> 00:49:56,830
Yeah.
You know,

1055
00:49:57,110 --> 00:49:58,400
like you said,
unless you live there,

1056
00:49:58,401 --> 00:50:00,200
it's hard to have an opinion one way or
another.

1057
00:50:00,590 --> 00:50:03,700
Everybody that has an opinion and it's
all.

1058
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,870
I mean,
people that have unrealistic opinions

1059
00:50:05,871 --> 00:50:08,360
about wolves.
Zoll coming from a beautiful place.

1060
00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:10,940
It's coming from a place of light.
They love animals.

1061
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:13,380
They do breed dogs and yeah,
they do.

1062
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:14,391
Yeah.
They have letters,

1063
00:50:14,391 --> 00:50:15,920
man.
Nothing's hunting them.

1064
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:17,870
Yeah.
People are going with the Alphas.

1065
00:50:17,871 --> 00:50:20,780
Good to breed.
He better fucking read up on history.

1066
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:22,430
Natural his desk.
Not True.

1067
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,980
They feel fuck dogs.
Fuck like crazy.

1068
00:50:24,981 --> 00:50:27,560
The alphas control most of the.
Yeah,

1069
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:28,160
but it doesn't

1070
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,240
mean the other ones don't.
Fuck.

1071
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:31,070
There's a lot of bulbs.
They have.

1072
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:35,810
They just did some recent survey on
wolves in a,

1073
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:39,650
I believe it was Idaho and they were
talking about how many of them there are

1074
00:50:39,990 --> 00:50:40,820
like,
whoa.

1075
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:43,940
Like this is kind of.
They're far beyond where they thought

1076
00:50:43,941 --> 00:50:46,730
that they needed to be before they would
put them back on the hunting list,

1077
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:49,850
but they don't,
they don't ever want to put them on.

1078
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:54,200
Like what happens is they reintroduced
them in the nineties and before that

1079
00:50:54,201 --> 00:50:57,110
they were pretty much wiped out by
cattle ranchers and all these people

1080
00:50:57,111 --> 00:51:00,730
throughout the west.
There's very few like wild wolves and

1081
00:51:00,731 --> 00:51:03,950
North America.
And so they reintroduced these wolves

1082
00:51:03,951 --> 00:51:07,310
from Canada that happened to be larger
by the way.

1083
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:13,220
They're larger wolves and the wolves
that were naturally here.

1084
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:15,980
What did the native Americans do?
Both the wolf population.

1085
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:18,080
Well,
uh,

1086
00:51:18,081 --> 00:51:19,220
they didn't.
They mean they,

1087
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:22,970
they killed them certainly because they,
they used to use their skin's a sneak up

1088
00:51:22,971 --> 00:51:26,840
on bison actually.
Here's a crazy fucking famous painting

1089
00:51:26,841 --> 00:51:30,710
and iconic iconic painting of these,
uh,

1090
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:35,770
American Indians with a wolf costume on,
like they have a covering their body and

1091
00:51:37,101 --> 00:51:41,690
they're crawling with a bow and Arrow up
to these bison because bison weren't

1092
00:51:41,691 --> 00:51:46,691
scared of wolves really hardcore shaking
your head seriously.

1093
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:48,920
Yeah.
Bisons don't.

1094
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:50,930
That's one of the reasons why there were
so many of them.

1095
00:51:50,970 --> 00:51:54,350
No other animals really had a very
difficult time taking them out.

1096
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:55,760
Look at this.
There's the picture.

1097
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:58,340
That's like an icon.
That's exactly how it went and looked at

1098
00:51:58,341 --> 00:51:59,174
me.
Or is there

1099
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:03,830
going to be bone chilling?
How did that feel?

1100
00:52:03,831 --> 00:52:05,900
Like staring that thing down,
man.

1101
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:08,790
I froze.
I literally froze because I just

1102
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:09,860
started.
Didn't know what to do.

1103
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:12,710
Could be the end of your themes you're
standing relating to realize I'm,

1104
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:16,310
I've just put myself on a horrendously
bad situation.

1105
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:19,850
The amount of force they could generate.
You can't even resist it.

1106
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,700
There's nothing you could do.
You're just completely helpless.

1107
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,290
Like there's literally nothing you could
do.

1108
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:27,710
They run faster than you and there,
you know,

1109
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:31,190
that's a 1500 to 2000 pound animal.

1110
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:37,610
The Indians snuck up on him like that.
And um,

1111
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:40,220
my friend Steve Rinella and not Steven
Rinella,

1112
00:52:40,221 --> 00:52:43,460
remy warrant.
He has this television show called Apex

1113
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,090
Predator.
And um,

1114
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:49,550
they did all these different episodes on
the ways different animals hunt their

1115
00:52:49,551 --> 00:52:52,950
prey and see if he could recreate it.
And that's one of the things that he

1116
00:52:52,951 --> 00:52:55,910
did.
He took a wolf skin and put it on him

1117
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:59,720
and crawled up to these buffalo and got
like right inside them.

1118
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:03,070
Yeah,
but they're afraid of us.

1119
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,480
Well,
they're afraid of people because of bang

1120
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,100
sticks.
True to the.

1121
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:10,280
I was saying earlier,
I forgot what I was talking about for a

1122
00:53:10,281 --> 00:53:12,920
second,
but a friend of mine as a guide in

1123
00:53:12,921 --> 00:53:17,240
Colorado and they found these mountain
lion tracks like all these mountain lion

1124
00:53:17,241 --> 00:53:22,010
tracks and then elk tracks and then the
mountain lion tracks and the elk tracks

1125
00:53:22,011 --> 00:53:26,700
together and then there's a space of
like several hundred yards,

1126
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:31,380
whether it was just elk tracks and so
they followed that elk track and they

1127
00:53:31,381 --> 00:53:34,530
found a mountain lion on top of the elk
killing it.

1128
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:39,630
His fucking giant elk,
like thousand pound elk.

1129
00:53:39,631 --> 00:53:43,230
He said it was a huge six by six,
so you're talking about it in a mature

1130
00:53:43,231 --> 00:53:45,750
animal and this mountain lion.
I was like,

1131
00:53:45,751 --> 00:53:47,370
fuck it,
I'm going for it.

1132
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:51,270
And he jumped on this thing and clamped
a whole of its back and then brought it

1133
00:53:51,271 --> 00:53:52,980
down the mountain line weight 150
pounds.

1134
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:58,070
So it took out this thousand plus pound
elk by jumping on his back and biting

1135
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,590
its neck.
You guys get them down in the valley and

1136
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:01,463
allies?
Yeah.

1137
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:05,190
Encroaching killed a Koala bear at the
zoo the other day.

1138
00:54:07,470 --> 00:54:09,600
Yeah.
Now are taking it seriously.

1139
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:12,780
They're like,
how the fuck did it get in?

1140
00:54:13,330 --> 00:54:16,470
It's got a 12 foot high fence.
There's razor wire on the top panel.

1141
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,780
Sneaky as cat,
man.

1142
00:54:17,810 --> 00:54:19,600
Come on.
It's so that little fucker that you

1143
00:54:19,610 --> 00:54:20,690
walk.
And it was like [inaudible].

1144
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:24,600
I know,
but he climbed over barbed wire.

1145
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:25,800
That's hardcore.
Dude.

1146
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:28,020
That's hard.
As fucking court gets

1147
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:33,180
12 foot high fence barbed wire at the
top was like,

1148
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:34,440
hmm,
good try.

1149
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:37,830
Good try.
He probably got caught up a bit,

1150
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,680
but whatever.
He's a mountain lion.

1151
00:54:40,681 --> 00:54:45,681
They probably hear like that to in 150
pound cat.

1152
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,740
Yeah.
Like if you're riding your bike one day,

1153
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,610
one of those things falls over tree on
your head.

1154
00:54:50,670 --> 00:54:55,670
It's going to God with these big old
saber teeth and like take you to the

1155
00:54:56,911 --> 00:54:58,950
ground and fucking play with you for
awhile.

1156
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:00,020
It's not just going to kill you.

1157
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:01,170
You know?
It's gonna,

1158
00:55:01,350 --> 00:55:02,970
it's gonna miss with the size of that
fucker.

1159
00:55:02,971 --> 00:55:04,800
That's the one that lives up to the
Hollywood hills.

1160
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:06,930
That's the one that they think killed
the Koala bear.

1161
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,180
That's a lion.
A lion.

1162
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:11,100
I mean,
that's like a lion in Africa.

1163
00:55:11,101 --> 00:55:13,380
Lion.
Look the fucking forearms on that.

1164
00:55:14,290 --> 00:55:17,550
Like those forums.
It would be awful.

1165
00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:19,950
That isn't Stetson.
Insane amount of power.

1166
00:55:19,951 --> 00:55:23,170
That thing was have.
And they say that pound for pound.

1167
00:55:23,171 --> 00:55:28,171
They're one of the strongest cats on my
shoulders and arms.

1168
00:55:28,561 --> 00:55:30,690
My Gut,
I'll tell you right now for Bobcat,

1169
00:55:30,691 --> 00:55:32,610
tries to fuck with me.
I'll fuck up a bobcat.

1170
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:35,940
I'm pretty,
pretty confident I'll kick a bobcat's

1171
00:55:35,941 --> 00:55:39,630
ass,
but it still wouldn't be fun.

1172
00:55:40,790 --> 00:55:41,730
No,
I'm kidding man.

1173
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:44,400
Look,
I have cats and I have to wash them.

1174
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:45,720
And uh,
my,

1175
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,880
my daughter is allergic to cats and the
way we,

1176
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:50,010
the only way we communicate is we have
to shave them.

1177
00:55:50,310 --> 00:55:53,790
So they get a buzz cut like a lion's cut
and washed them.

1178
00:55:53,791 --> 00:55:56,190
And it makes a giant difference in how
much damage are they leave.

1179
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:58,620
They leave because they're both like
really fluffy cats.

1180
00:55:58,790 --> 00:56:02,760
They would leave cat hair everywhere,
but so this solution made a bit,

1181
00:56:02,761 --> 00:56:05,220
but I have to fucking hold onto these
little fuckers,

1182
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:09,840
why they get shaved and man,
even though like they love me and that,

1183
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,820
you know,
when they want to go man,

1184
00:56:11,821 --> 00:56:16,170
they want to go and you realize like how
difficult they are to controls Agila

1185
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,380
yeah.
That fucking boot.

1186
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:22,080
They twist and contort fucking to kick
it off yet.

1187
00:56:22,081 --> 00:56:24,250
And it,
this big long sinewy

1188
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:26,020
relaxed muscles that all of a sudden
you're like,

1189
00:56:26,021 --> 00:56:29,100
Holy Shit,
you're actually a little bodybuilder.

1190
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:30,610
Okay.
You're just so lucky.

1191
00:56:30,611 --> 00:56:35,060
We're so much bigger than them.
But with a mountain lion as a Bobcat,

1192
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,400
I'm gonna.
Come,

1193
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:38,290
come get some bobcat.
I'll fuck you up,

1194
00:56:38,291 --> 00:56:42,030
bitch.
It'd probably be terrified.

1195
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:44,560
That was a cute one.
That's a links though.

1196
00:56:44,590 --> 00:56:46,380
I don't think that's a bobcat.
Those,

1197
00:56:46,381 --> 00:56:47,000
uh,
there's.

1198
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,210
See those weird links is they have in
Canada.

1199
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:51,130
Those white never been to Canada,
man.

1200
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:52,000
No,
actually it's not true.

1201
00:56:52,001 --> 00:56:53,770
I've been to Canada.
I've just never been up to the part of

1202
00:56:53,771 --> 00:56:57,610
Canada that I'd really like to see.
They have these weird cats,

1203
00:56:57,611 --> 00:56:58,790
man.
They don't even look real.

1204
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:03,340
They look like a star wars cat.
It's called a lynx lynx and they have

1205
00:57:03,341 --> 00:57:05,970
these crazy big paws with [inaudible]
serious.

1206
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:07,660
Look at that weird ears.
Yeah,

1207
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:08,230
come on man.

1208
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:11,620
That's like an animal.
Go some Turkish delight.

1209
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:12,671
Yeah.
Look at that.

1210
00:57:12,671 --> 00:57:15,310
That doesn't even look real.
Look at that cat.

1211
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:16,510
Tell me.
That looks real.

1212
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:19,360
That looks like something from some
weird movie.

1213
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:23,260
Like the proportions.
I go back to Jamie.

1214
00:57:23,530 --> 00:57:26,470
They'll get the proportions of its body.
It's so odd.

1215
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:31,540
Giant feet long as big legs.
Just so weird.

1216
00:57:31,541 --> 00:57:36,370
Body man.
And that thing is just up there earning

1217
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:40,780
just earning.
Just out there hustling everyday jacket

1218
00:57:40,781 --> 00:57:43,390
shit with its face.
Like what does it hunt and Canada I

1219
00:57:43,391 --> 00:57:44,940
guess everything.
I'm sure.

1220
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,960
Small things.
I don't think they get that big.

1221
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:49,600
I mean if I had to guess,
I would say links probably only gets to

1222
00:57:49,601 --> 00:57:52,900
be like 50 pounds.
See what it see how big they get.

1223
00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:55,180
See if I'm right.
I don't think they get much bigger than

1224
00:57:55,181 --> 00:57:56,150
that,
but I think they,

1225
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:57,310
they probably eat.

1226
00:57:57,390 --> 00:58:01,000
I'm 24 pounds.
Okay.

1227
00:58:01,570 --> 00:58:06,040
I think they probably eat like rabbits
and squirrels or Fonz.

1228
00:58:06,041 --> 00:58:10,750
They'll definitely eat fonz.
We found this fucked up video of this

1229
00:58:10,751 --> 00:58:11,680
Martin,
uh,

1230
00:58:11,681 --> 00:58:13,420
Martin chasing a rabbit.
You know,

1231
00:58:13,421 --> 00:58:15,900
what a Martin is,
what was the play it for him?

1232
00:58:15,901 --> 00:58:18,940
Jamie Martin.
Martin is an animal that I always

1233
00:58:18,941 --> 00:58:21,940
associated with for because of those
Alaska shows,

1234
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:23,500
you know,
those shows where the dudes are living

1235
00:58:23,501 --> 00:58:26,380
up in Alaska.
There's one called mountain men and this

1236
00:58:26,381 --> 00:58:30,940
guy runs a food trap line and one of the
things that he trapped is Martin Martin.

1237
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:34,000
It's like a little badger and it's
chasing after a rabbit.

1238
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:39,260
So the little black thing and the back
is the PA is the Martin and this is a

1239
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:42,910
literally a run for life.
Look at this rabbit is going fuck,

1240
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:45,120
fuck.
And the Martins hustling behind him.

1241
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:47,080
He was moving.
Fuck you at is.

1242
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:51,220
And this is like a crazy sprint.
I mean they're both sprinting.

1243
00:58:51,370 --> 00:58:55,630
It's like how long can they do it for?
And the Martin just is relentless and

1244
00:58:55,631 --> 00:58:57,640
these people are filming this for their
fucking car.

1245
00:58:57,641 --> 00:59:01,580
Following them behind them on the road.
And uh,

1246
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:05,830
the Martin just finally the rabbit
starts trying to veer off the road and

1247
00:59:05,831 --> 00:59:09,700
he gets into the sick shit and the
Martin closes the distance.

1248
00:59:10,030 --> 00:59:14,230
But look at the drama here.
It runs better on the Hong Bitch.

1249
00:59:14,790 --> 00:59:16,710
Oh my God.
Yeah.

1250
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:19,060
And what's crazy is they're the same
size.

1251
00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:20,950
In fact,
the Martin is smaller.

1252
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:23,810
The rabbit look at the difference things
mean as shit.

1253
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:26,300
Oh yeah man.
I mean he just carried it up by its

1254
00:59:26,301 --> 00:59:27,820
face.
That's jumping.

1255
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:28,933
He,
he's like,

1256
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,250
he's like,
he hit a nitro button or something,

1257
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,140
but he knew the end was near.
It was cool.

1258
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:36,830
Yeah.
Imagine if you are download rabbit hole

1259
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:40,040
on this thought with a dude to the death
with your faces,

1260
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,240
right?
You're good.

1261
00:59:41,330 --> 00:59:46,330
You killed them with your face and then
dragged him up a hill with your face all

1262
00:59:46,671 --> 00:59:50,480
in the course of 15 seconds from the
time that Martin got ahold of that

1263
00:59:50,481 --> 00:59:52,400
rabbit,
that rabbit is dead as fuck.

1264
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:56,030
And he was carrying away in 15 seconds
with this phase.

1265
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:05,350
No.
One of my good buddies is a radiology

1266
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:11,120
technician and he must,
he sees all kinds of horrible shit

1267
01:00:11,210 --> 01:00:13,040
happening to people every day.
You know what I mean?

1268
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:15,230
That's why I'm thankful.
I just have to get up and try to sing in

1269
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:20,180
pitch ever to make money.
He said the worst thing he ever told me

1270
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:25,690
was a,
there was a guy who was driving along on

1271
01:00:26,211 --> 01:00:28,040
his way to work.
One morning he hit a deer,

1272
01:00:28,430 --> 01:00:32,060
the deer,
the body split in half and the ass end

1273
01:00:32,061 --> 01:00:34,340
of the deer came up over the hood and
through his windshield.

1274
01:00:34,341 --> 01:00:37,340
And I was just intestines and blood and
shit and guts everywhere.

1275
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:39,950
All literally like the glass room.
And she'll cut his face all up.

1276
01:00:39,951 --> 01:00:43,440
So now he's got all this shit down in
the blood and in his face.

1277
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:45,170
Uh,
so they bring this guy.

1278
01:00:45,230 --> 01:00:50,230
And so he came in and was like,
went through the windshield and laid

1279
01:00:50,961 --> 01:00:54,650
down in this creek bed.
Like after he hits the deer and lay

1280
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:56,150
there.
And while I was like laying in the damn

1281
01:00:56,151 --> 01:00:59,330
creek bed,
raccoons came and snacked on his fucking

1282
01:00:59,331 --> 01:01:02,230
face.
So then when these guided of living,

1283
01:01:02,270 --> 01:01:05,210
but I mean between all the bacteria.
So he got jacked.

1284
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:06,590
Yeah,
hit a deer.

1285
01:01:06,650 --> 01:01:10,760
All that shit happened and I guess he
liked came out of the truck and then

1286
01:01:10,761 --> 01:01:12,890
laid down in this ditch until they found
him like,

1287
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:14,330
you know,
however many hours later.

1288
01:01:14,331 --> 01:01:18,620
And while he was laying there
unconscious wild woodland creatures had

1289
01:01:18,621 --> 01:01:23,621
came and eaten the open dude had a bad
day.

1290
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:28,650
How much of his face got bitten off?

1291
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:29,760
Oh Man,
I'll,

1292
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:33,620
I'll.
Patrick said it was not pretty holy fuck

1293
01:01:33,621 --> 01:01:36,500
man.
And the donor didn't actually live.

1294
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:38,280
Oh God.
You know,

1295
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:42,260
I don't know that I'd want to survive
something like that or maybe you do.

1296
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:43,700
I always want to survive.
But

1297
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:45,100
yeah,
you always want to survive.

1298
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:48,250
You just want to survive just to kill as
many fucking raccoon can be.

1299
01:01:48,251 --> 01:01:51,730
Like the best raccoon hunter ever.
That day on the,

1300
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:55,410
a raccoon serial killer.
Just standing in front of trash cans.

1301
01:01:55,430 --> 01:01:58,420
A rifle.
Yeah.

1302
01:01:58,450 --> 01:02:00,100
I'm glad I don't have to work at a
hospital.

1303
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,790
Oh Dude,
I have a buddy was an emt.

1304
01:02:02,910 --> 01:02:05,740
Tell me some stories.
The craziest stories.

1305
01:02:05,770 --> 01:02:09,610
My friend Steve,
he's an ophthalmologist and he did his

1306
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:14,350
residency in Miami during the cocaine
days and he's played.

1307
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:15,550
He's like,
dude,

1308
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:18,250
you don't even fucking nothing to this
day.

1309
01:02:18,251 --> 01:02:20,400
This Guy Steve is strapped

1310
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:21,510
everywhere.
He goes,

1311
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,820
yeah.
He wears a fucking gun everywhere.

1312
01:02:23,821 --> 01:02:25,980
He doesn't play games.
She lives in Arizona and one of the

1313
01:02:25,981 --> 01:02:28,470
reasons why he likes Arizona because you
can conceal carry.

1314
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:33,210
It just seemed too much.
He saw too much early on,

1315
01:02:33,570 --> 01:02:36,680
you know he,
he told me just every day was just

1316
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:39,480
gunshot to the head.
Gunshot to the head,

1317
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:42,000
gunshot to the head like you're in.

1318
01:02:42,170 --> 01:02:43,150
Yeah,
yeah.

1319
01:02:43,580 --> 01:02:47,990
How are you going to maintain any kind
of positive outlook and you can't just

1320
01:02:48,010 --> 01:02:49,270
get completely burned out.

1321
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:51,810
You get out of it and he got out of it.
When he got out of it,

1322
01:02:51,811 --> 01:02:53,390
it was just like this big breath.
I

1323
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:57,600
whoa,
what the fuck that I just experienced,

1324
01:02:57,601 --> 01:03:02,601
but now the knowledge that not only was
that a real thing that he was

1325
01:03:02,821 --> 01:03:06,000
experiencing on a daily basis,
all that insane violence and all the

1326
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:07,290
gunshots,
all the craziness.

1327
01:03:07,830 --> 01:03:11,310
He knows that even if it's not like that
anymore,

1328
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:14,300
like even if people,
there's the cocaine days are Kinda over.

1329
01:03:14,301 --> 01:03:16,520
Miami is much more calm.
The violence not as back.

1330
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:20,160
He knows that that is what people are
capable of within his lifetime.

1331
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:22,190
I'm,
you still see this shit all.

1332
01:03:22,530 --> 01:03:24,630
I bet you do,
but I think there was a level of it

1333
01:03:25,110 --> 01:03:29,490
during the eighties in Miami.
Do you know who billy Corbin is?

1334
01:03:29,491 --> 01:03:32,550
The a documentary filmmaker names.
Familiar.

1335
01:03:32,580 --> 01:03:36,320
He's got these two great documentaries
called cocaine cowboys.

1336
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:37,910
Cowboys too.
Yeah,

1337
01:03:38,810 --> 01:03:42,360
and billy.
He's been on the podcast before talking

1338
01:03:42,361 --> 01:03:46,440
about it,
but he did a great job of showing how

1339
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:51,060
insane that time was.
Which one of the things that he talked

1340
01:03:51,061 --> 01:03:54,960
about was how one year,
the graduating class of the police

1341
01:03:54,961 --> 01:03:58,200
academy,
every single one of them within like a

1342
01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:59,760
year was either dead or in jail.

1343
01:04:01,590 --> 01:04:04,870
They had been murdered or they were in
jail for corruption.

1344
01:04:04,871 --> 01:04:08,410
Like the whole police department was
just massively corrupt.

1345
01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:12,640
Everyone was doing cocaine.
There was murders like crazy all left

1346
01:04:12,641 --> 01:04:13,960
and right.
All around.

1347
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:15,790
It was just complete chaos.

1348
01:04:16,030 --> 01:04:17,000
Yeah.
Who's the little.

1349
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:19,330
One of the guys' names from the
documentary,

1350
01:04:19,331 --> 01:04:22,510
the
white dude with the mustache,

1351
01:04:22,511 --> 01:04:24,070
that was kind of like a ringleader of it
all.

1352
01:04:24,071 --> 01:04:25,420
Yeah.
I think he went to prison and he's out.

1353
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:26,191
Yeah,
yeah,

1354
01:04:26,191 --> 01:04:26,681
yeah,
yeah.

1355
01:04:26,681 --> 01:04:29,680
The guy who flew the planes very.
The money and the yards.

1356
01:04:29,681 --> 01:04:33,430
I don't remember his name either,
but I remember the lady Grizelda or

1357
01:04:33,470 --> 01:04:36,010
Zelda godmother.
Oh,

1358
01:04:36,930 --> 01:04:38,830
the lady.
I think she's still alive,

1359
01:04:38,831 --> 01:04:40,810
man.
I mean she might've died recently,

1360
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:44,210
but I think she was alive and free and
Columbia.

1361
01:04:44,410 --> 01:04:46,140
She's living in South America for a long
time.

1362
01:04:46,141 --> 01:04:46,960
And hiring.
Yeah.

1363
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:49,960
She got out of jail in America and you
know,

1364
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:52,360
if,
if her hitman who was in jail was in the

1365
01:04:52,361 --> 01:04:54,520
documentary,
is being honest about how many people

1366
01:04:54,521 --> 01:04:56,140
she killed.
Like,

1367
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:57,550
Whoa,
whoa.

1368
01:04:57,551 --> 01:04:59,490
Jack.
She launched,

1369
01:04:59,491 --> 01:05:01,120
died in 2012.
Ah,

1370
01:05:01,350 --> 01:05:05,230
there you go.
So when the second movie was made,

1371
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:08,050
they focused on her and her being
released.

1372
01:05:11,930 --> 01:05:14,210
Oh my God.
What a crazy time.

1373
01:05:14,570 --> 01:05:16,970
But so my friend Steve,
you just saw all that man.

1374
01:05:17,010 --> 01:05:18,010
Just,
he

1375
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:22,390
saw a guy with a light bulb up his ass
for what?

1376
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:24,670
Someone's stuffed a light bulb up their
ass.

1377
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:28,360
You know when those twisty light bulbs
don't like Christmas tree looking,

1378
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:34,510
they put this up my ass.
Big Ass one.

1379
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:35,531
You know?
I mean,

1380
01:05:35,531 --> 01:05:37,870
I say it looks like Christmas tree.
I don't mean like a little one that's on

1381
01:05:37,871 --> 01:05:40,240
your tree.
I'm talking about several inch long.

1382
01:05:40,241 --> 01:05:42,610
Light Bulb was stuffed up.
This dude's ass.

1383
01:05:43,570 --> 01:05:44,620
People get bored,
man.

1384
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:45,291
Yeah,
he.

1385
01:05:45,291 --> 01:05:46,540
They found everything.
Wine,

1386
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:47,770
champagne,
corks,

1387
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:53,380
all sorts of different objects like
coffee cups and stuff.

1388
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:56,530
Yeah.
You ever heard any stories like that?

1389
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:02,710
I guess it's also probably correlates
with the cocaine days.

1390
01:06:02,711 --> 01:06:04,780
They're probably just sticking things in
every hole.

1391
01:06:04,781 --> 01:06:09,250
They had
hats off to anybody.

1392
01:06:09,330 --> 01:06:13,450
I can work a coffee because you and your
ass so that it was fun seeing all this

1393
01:06:13,451 --> 01:06:14,720
stuff like that.
The,

1394
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:19,980
the different layers of society you're
dealing with on a day to day basis and

1395
01:06:21,970 --> 01:06:26,970
having to hold a any type of firm belief
in humanity or civilization.

1396
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:29,830
I don't know where a person.
I think

1397
01:06:30,130 --> 01:06:34,060
even people that don't see violence like
people maybe that see just a lot of

1398
01:06:34,061 --> 01:06:37,570
accidents.
That's got to be spooky.

1399
01:06:39,010 --> 01:06:43,020
They say that a lot of women who are
like emt,

1400
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:47,290
I have a hard time settling down and
like having families,

1401
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:51,820
like they get whacked out by it.
Like particularly that might be sexist

1402
01:06:51,821 --> 01:06:55,900
to say I don't think it is because uh,
I think that's something that I've heard

1403
01:06:56,230 --> 01:06:59,650
female ain't emt talk about just their
own personal experiences,

1404
01:07:00,070 --> 01:07:02,080
but that it's so,
so dark.

1405
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:05,920
Like everyday you're seeing broken necks
and broken legs.

1406
01:07:05,921 --> 01:07:09,200
It's car accidents and people splattered
on the road and you know,

1407
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:13,120
Uhm,
because grueling after awhile.

1408
01:07:13,270 --> 01:07:16,400
So what's like ptsd numbers like
unprofessional,

1409
01:07:16,420 --> 01:07:16,871
like that.
I mean,

1410
01:07:16,871 --> 01:07:18,350
you got to be having some trauma.
Oh yeah,

1411
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,530
for sure.
You know,

1412
01:07:20,930 --> 01:07:22,570
um,
there's a certain amount of stress that

1413
01:07:22,571 --> 01:07:25,540
I think comes with any kind of job where
you're looking at death a lot.

1414
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,780
I mean,
how much ptsd does a doctor have?

1415
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:32,620
Like emergency room doctors,
how much do they just get accustomed to

1416
01:07:32,621 --> 01:07:35,830
it?
I think it takes a very special type of

1417
01:07:35,831 --> 01:07:37,210
personality,
you know?

1418
01:07:37,211 --> 01:07:38,290
I think it also,
it is,

1419
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:40,670
does man.
I think it's really a lot like what we

1420
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:45,250
were talking about when you're taking in
all these stories in the world because

1421
01:07:45,550 --> 01:07:48,190
you can manage your own life,
but you're not.

1422
01:07:48,220 --> 01:07:50,200
You're.
If you're paying attention to the news,

1423
01:07:50,201 --> 01:07:53,770
you're going to get inundated with
stories by the 7 billion people and it's

1424
01:07:53,771 --> 01:07:56,230
just too much.
It's just too much data coming at you

1425
01:07:56,231 --> 01:07:58,810
and too much of it negative.
I think that's probably the same way

1426
01:07:58,811 --> 01:08:02,020
with like an emergency room doctor.
Like it's okay if you see somebody get

1427
01:08:02,021 --> 01:08:04,510
hurt once in your life a few times in
your life or,

1428
01:08:04,810 --> 01:08:06,010
or maybe even,
you know,

1429
01:08:06,730 --> 01:08:09,320
like you,
you can get desensitized.

1430
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:10,820
They're not processing.
Again,

1431
01:08:10,821 --> 01:08:13,880
it's just,
it's onto the next case.

1432
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:16,700
You can definitely desensitized.
It doesn't,

1433
01:08:16,701 --> 01:08:18,920
it's not.
It doesn't freak you out anymore.

1434
01:08:19,290 --> 01:08:22,660
You see a guy whose leg is hanging off
and you know,

1435
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:26,420
I mean,
especially guys who are taking care of

1436
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:27,700
troops,
you know,

1437
01:08:27,930 --> 01:08:30,140
or emt.
Oh my God.

1438
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:32,120
Oh my God.
People were shooting at you.

1439
01:08:32,170 --> 01:08:32,950
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

1440
01:08:32,950 --> 01:08:34,370
Yeah.
I tried to carry them out while bullets

1441
01:08:34,371 --> 01:08:37,730
are flying.
It's insanity.

1442
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:41,200
Again.
I'll just try to sing in key math and I

1443
01:08:41,210 --> 01:08:43,850
know
we've got it easy.

1444
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:49,070
It's just fascinating how many different
ways to be a person there are.

1445
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:52,310
You know,
how many different different kinds of

1446
01:08:52,311 --> 01:08:56,480
lives you can live,
how many different types of experiences

1447
01:08:56,481 --> 01:09:00,860
you can have and your reality could be
so much different than somebody else's

1448
01:09:00,861 --> 01:09:04,430
reality and you're convinced that your
reality is life and they're convinced

1449
01:09:04,431 --> 01:09:05,270
that there is life.

1450
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:06,890
You know,
like what we're talking about with the

1451
01:09:06,891 --> 01:09:08,990
wolves.
Like those people that live near those

1452
01:09:09,050 --> 01:09:11,450
things that are fucking shitting their
pants when they hear those howls at

1453
01:09:11,451 --> 01:09:15,110
night.
My buddy lives in BC and his neighbor's

1454
01:09:15,111 --> 01:09:17,960
cow was taken out by wolves.
While they're all watching,

1455
01:09:19,250 --> 01:09:23,050
they're all looking out the window
they're going to do.

1456
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:26,090
Can't do shit.
He can go out and start shooting for to

1457
01:09:26,091 --> 01:09:29,360
get full and fuck off.
You can go out and start shooting,

1458
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:32,580
but it's dark.
Unless you have pretty nice scope.

1459
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:34,680
I could live up there,
but yeah,

1460
01:09:34,850 --> 01:09:37,520
the winters I think would just be.
That's the thing.

1461
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:40,610
They're ruthless,
but anywhere that's.

1462
01:09:41,030 --> 01:09:43,280
It's too nice.
You get too many people.

1463
01:09:43,730 --> 01:09:46,550
Like we were talking about Los Angeles
is too perfect.

1464
01:09:46,670 --> 01:09:50,600
Everyday the weather's perfect,
but because of that you have to bring

1465
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:53,750
carbon monoxide air.
Uh,

1466
01:09:53,910 --> 01:09:54,920
you know,
have a.

1467
01:09:55,230 --> 01:09:56,660
yesterday it was the first time I'd
ever,

1468
01:09:58,340 --> 01:10:02,250
at some point I think we're,
my family was ready for an adventure or

1469
01:10:02,251 --> 01:10:03,410
a relocation.
But yeah,

1470
01:10:03,411 --> 01:10:06,860
I don't know that I could ever acclimate
no matter how long I was here to

1471
01:10:06,861 --> 01:10:11,861
convincing myself that the traffic is
worth it,

1472
01:10:11,990 --> 01:10:13,340
worth it.
It doesn't.

1473
01:10:13,370 --> 01:10:14,570
You don't have to live here.
See,

1474
01:10:14,571 --> 01:10:17,270
that's the beautiful thing about
southern California is you could live in

1475
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:19,480
San Diego,
La Jolla,

1476
01:10:19,740 --> 01:10:22,980
like,
which is beautiful and quiet and fucking

1477
01:10:23,170 --> 01:10:26,570
picture ask.
You see the ocean's right there.

1478
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:28,770
So pretty.
Like the northern part of the state law

1479
01:10:28,771 --> 01:10:33,771
to northern part stays amazing.
I was in Mendocino over by where the

1480
01:10:35,241 --> 01:10:39,650
ocean is.
It's like three hours plus maybe four

1481
01:10:39,651 --> 01:10:44,651
hours north of San Francisco.
So pretty man soap or the redwood

1482
01:10:45,171 --> 01:10:46,760
forest.
We went through the redwood forest,

1483
01:10:47,090 --> 01:10:49,260
did all that shit,
was so pretty.

1484
01:10:49,270 --> 01:10:52,010
The Monterey once for a meeting with my
booking agency,

1485
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:54,080
the people who live there get it pretty,
pretty well.

1486
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:57,510
That does not suck than uh,
some friends of St Louis Obispo.

1487
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:58,940
That's really,
that's a nice spot to.

1488
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:00,970
Those places are calm,
right?

1489
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:02,330
Really Mellow.
Yeah.

1490
01:11:02,390 --> 01:11:05,630
Real mellow.
My Buddy John Lives in San Luis Obispo.

1491
01:11:06,370 --> 01:11:10,450
It was about 15 years younger la,
which would seem like a good idea right

1492
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,990
now.
Santa Barbara.

1493
01:11:13,050 --> 01:11:14,110
Real nice to really

1494
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:15,980
love it there.
I'm going,

1495
01:11:16,190 --> 01:11:19,050
I've got a gig there on Friday night,
Santa Barbara.

1496
01:11:19,051 --> 01:11:22,110
It's like,
I don't think it's more than 100,000

1497
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:23,010
plus.
People

1498
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:28,850
don't think it's very big.
Man was shooter.

1499
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:30,110
Loves it out here.
He's lived out here.

1500
01:11:30,140 --> 01:11:31,710
Well,
well he's crazy.

1501
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:34,110
Shooter shooter lives in the heart of
darkness.

1502
01:11:35,690 --> 01:11:38,580
Was An apartment in Los Filez.
He's a crazy man.

1503
01:11:39,450 --> 01:11:40,320
He's like,
you know,

1504
01:11:40,321 --> 01:11:41,480
he loves it.
Shooters.

1505
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:45,420
Such a character.
I love that guy who just got on a plane.

1506
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:46,590
Oh,
he's the best.

1507
01:11:48,030 --> 01:11:52,050
He's also just like such a character,
like who he is as a person.

1508
01:11:52,570 --> 01:11:55,140
Know we had him in here and he was
talking about,

1509
01:11:55,590 --> 01:11:57,550
about doing meth was like,
Oh yeah,

1510
01:11:57,551 --> 01:11:58,620
I've done math night.
Shit.

1511
01:12:02,380 --> 01:12:03,031
Like,
come on man,

1512
01:12:03,031 --> 01:12:05,660
you ain't done math.
Never tried.

1513
01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:08,170
Plank road
trucker.

1514
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:13,190
Craig is a talented guy too.
And I also liked that.

1515
01:12:13,591 --> 01:12:14,610
Um,
you know,

1516
01:12:14,611 --> 01:12:17,700
you could listen to any one of his
albums and it's like,

1517
01:12:17,701 --> 01:12:18,331
oh,
okay.

1518
01:12:18,331 --> 01:12:21,810
He's obviously in some totally different
phase in this album.

1519
01:12:21,811 --> 01:12:25,170
He's just trying some other shit out.
He's one of them were naturally and

1520
01:12:25,171 --> 01:12:28,230
genuinely curious and interested,
interested,

1521
01:12:28,890 --> 01:12:30,840
you know,
like when he's listening to you and

1522
01:12:30,841 --> 01:12:32,280
asking questions,
he actually means it.

1523
01:12:32,430 --> 01:12:33,420
Oh yeah,
yeah.

1524
01:12:33,630 --> 01:12:38,630
Which is a rare thing in the music
business coming from the sun of royalty.

1525
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:40,540
Right.
You know,

1526
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:42,450
I mean,
his dad was royalty.

1527
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:46,470
I mean there's,
there's a few musical icons that you

1528
01:12:46,471 --> 01:12:49,410
look at it and you go,
well that's like in the royal 100,

1529
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:51,000
100 percent.
You know,

1530
01:12:51,001 --> 01:12:53,550
Waylon Jennings is in the fucking royal
100.

1531
01:12:54,210 --> 01:12:57,720
I mean there's just,
there's just people that are in,

1532
01:12:57,900 --> 01:12:59,700
you know,
Chuck Berry's in,

1533
01:12:59,970 --> 01:13:00,660
you know what I'm saying?

1534
01:13:00,660 --> 01:13:03,480
He's in forever.
Waylon Jennings is in,

1535
01:13:03,870 --> 01:13:06,390
he's in,
that's his son,

1536
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:11,660
so for him to be so normal and also be a
musician and not be some Weirdo who

1537
01:13:13,470 --> 01:13:17,160
fucking desperately craves attention or
needs validation,

1538
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:22,920
he's a genuine artist and very content.
If anything,

1539
01:13:22,921 --> 01:13:27,921
I've seen him use his position to only
try to help other people instead of

1540
01:13:29,461 --> 01:13:31,590
himself,
unless the truth man.

1541
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:36,210
Uh,
well his mom was obviously so nice to.

1542
01:13:36,270 --> 01:13:38,970
Oh yeah,
she's so nice.

1543
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:42,030
So and,
and really like sharp and smart.

1544
01:13:42,510 --> 01:13:44,120
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.

1545
01:13:44,470 --> 01:13:46,440
Paying attention.
Oh yeah man,

1546
01:13:46,710 --> 01:13:50,850
it's cool to talk to him.
It's so weird.

1547
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:54,030
Businessman trying to.
I mean everyone out there,

1548
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:56,370
everyone.
I think that's true.

1549
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,920
Everyone that's not like some sort of a
perfect person.

1550
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:01,770
He's trying to do better with their
life,

1551
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:03,720
you know,
trying to improve on whatever you're

1552
01:14:03,721 --> 01:14:06,660
doing,
whether it's your job or your business

1553
01:14:06,661 --> 01:14:08,830
or whatever.
Whatever your hobby is,

1554
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:10,980
your obsession.
We're all trying to improve on it.

1555
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:12,010
But one of the

1556
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:15,430
weird things about being a musician and
I guess a comic as well,

1557
01:14:15,431 --> 01:14:18,040
is that you're doing that in front of
everybody.

1558
01:14:19,090 --> 01:14:20,380
You know,
like your developed.

1559
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:23,320
We're all developing as humans,
you know,

1560
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:27,040
but you're also,
you're performing in front of all those

1561
01:14:27,041 --> 01:14:27,874
people.

1562
01:14:28,460 --> 01:14:29,630
Yeah,
it is.

1563
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:32,810
Uh,
when you,

1564
01:14:32,811 --> 01:14:35,780
when you write songs,
I guess you can't ever stop to think,

1565
01:14:35,781 --> 01:14:36,770
oh,
I have to sing this,

1566
01:14:36,771 --> 01:14:37,170
the restroom,

1567
01:14:37,170 --> 01:14:39,480
my life.
You know what I mean?

1568
01:14:42,270 --> 01:14:45,370
You could have the crowd you don't know.
Like that's our.

1569
01:14:46,510 --> 01:14:47,231
Well,
like for me,

1570
01:14:47,231 --> 01:14:48,310
I was,
I don't know,

1571
01:14:48,540 --> 01:14:52,870
I liked the song is just a lot of people
really like that sounds bad ass.

1572
01:14:52,940 --> 01:14:55,720
I play that song,
that gym almost every time I workout.

1573
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:58,300
That's a bad ass song.
You just do close to.

1574
01:14:58,301 --> 01:14:59,860
It was too close to the oil.
Yeah.

1575
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:01,760
It was a laundry list about

1576
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:03,610
my,
my,

1577
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:07,530
my view on laundry lists.
Experienced.

1578
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:10,960
Yeah.
It's just such a great song though.

1579
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:13,050
Yeah.
We'll dig that one back out.

1580
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:14,500
It was Tom,
tom to work it up,

1581
01:15:14,501 --> 01:15:16,720
I think in a new way and make it fresh
for us.

1582
01:15:17,230 --> 01:15:17,931
I don't know.
For me,

1583
01:15:17,931 --> 01:15:21,550
man,
I love the recording process most.

1584
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:22,850
Most of all.
Really.

1585
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:23,733
That's,
that's,

1586
01:15:24,490 --> 01:15:26,140
that's where you learn.
If you've improved,

1587
01:15:26,170 --> 01:15:27,670
you know,
you're under a microscope,

1588
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:32,700
a get hyperfocused in the studio,
it's a good thing.

1589
01:15:33,281 --> 01:15:36,460
Other people get tired or I'd probably
just keep them in there all day,

1590
01:15:36,461 --> 01:15:38,410
you know what I mean?
And then,

1591
01:15:38,770 --> 01:15:41,410
but it's almost like you're so tied to
this thing in,

1592
01:15:41,411 --> 01:15:45,760
in,
in it that by the time it's finished you

1593
01:15:45,761 --> 01:15:47,200
just don't even want to think about it
anymore.

1594
01:15:47,201 --> 01:15:48,070
You want to,
you gets like,

1595
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:49,000
all right,
well that's done,

1596
01:15:49,530 --> 01:15:50,201
right.
You know,

1597
01:15:50,201 --> 01:15:52,860
but now you got to work it up and go out
in a live context and,

1598
01:15:52,910 --> 01:15:55,480
and play this thing.
Whereas hopefully you've,

1599
01:15:55,540 --> 01:15:58,760
you've tried to bare your soul and be as
honest as possible,

1600
01:15:58,761 --> 01:16:02,350
but then you're standing in front of a
room every night so you have to block

1601
01:16:02,351 --> 01:16:04,480
that part of it out of,
out of your head that like people are

1602
01:16:04,481 --> 01:16:06,610
judging you,
you know?

1603
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:10,450
Uh,
and it's also part of it too,

1604
01:16:10,451 --> 01:16:12,790
you know,
you're living that life experience out

1605
01:16:12,791 --> 01:16:16,730
in real time.
So it's all been really educational and

1606
01:16:16,810 --> 01:16:21,810
new for me in terms of figuring out how
to navigate that is artistic away as

1607
01:16:22,781 --> 01:16:27,781
possible without
compromising anything.

1608
01:16:27,911 --> 01:16:28,744
I guess

1609
01:16:28,870 --> 01:16:31,000
I think we all learned from each other
in that way.

1610
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:32,770
You know,
it's got to sell.

1611
01:16:32,820 --> 01:16:34,630
Yeah.
Are you going get to do it anymore?

1612
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:39,670
Yeah.
Don't you learn from other musicians in

1613
01:16:39,671 --> 01:16:41,800
that way?
Do you see like how other guys are

1614
01:16:41,801 --> 01:16:43,760
handling it or how they,
uh,

1615
01:16:44,230 --> 01:16:45,970
how it influences their creative
process?

1616
01:16:45,971 --> 01:16:47,350
Does it influence you?

1617
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:51,950
Oh,
I mean you definitely noticed traits in

1618
01:16:51,951 --> 01:16:55,810
other people that you wish you had more
of or that you could maybe adhere to and

1619
01:16:55,811 --> 01:16:57,560
it's,
and it's motivating and,

1620
01:16:58,220 --> 01:16:59,053
but like he said,
you know,

1621
01:16:59,060 --> 01:17:01,280
it's just about trying to be a better
person.

1622
01:17:01,340 --> 01:17:02,510
Yeah.
And uh,

1623
01:17:02,930 --> 01:17:06,590
and use whatever outlet this is in order
to hopefully make other people feel good

1624
01:17:06,591 --> 01:17:08,180
to,
um,

1625
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:11,330
or to deal with things that maybe they
don't know how to express,

1626
01:17:12,230 --> 01:17:14,960
which for me I think is the most
important part of making music.

1627
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,440
And so that's what it's always given me
in the past before I was a performer and

1628
01:17:18,441 --> 01:17:21,440
I just loved it from a sheer listeners
position,

1629
01:17:21,441 --> 01:17:23,030
you know,
offers is a lot of comfort.

1630
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:26,570
And um,
I don't know,

1631
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:29,750
people tell you this after the shows
that you're making an impact on their

1632
01:17:29,751 --> 01:17:31,580
life and you know,
some,

1633
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:34,220
uh,
my buddy Jordan said that his friend,

1634
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:38,720
her grandmother's land in her hospital
bed and the last thing she heard,

1635
01:17:38,721 --> 01:17:40,350
she played her one of my songs,
like,

1636
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:41,360
you know,
that song,

1637
01:17:41,361 --> 01:17:43,070
my voice,
she just said,

1638
01:17:43,071 --> 01:17:46,040
wow,
he's got a really pretty voice and she's

1639
01:17:46,041 --> 01:17:47,400
like totally relaxed,
you know.

1640
01:17:47,430 --> 01:17:52,430
So you hear things like that and it's,
it's easy to get hung up on mechanics or

1641
01:17:54,830 --> 01:17:57,680
expectations or pressures or the
industry and all that.

1642
01:17:57,681 --> 01:18:00,650
But like it feels like if you just kind
of stepped back and hit pause,

1643
01:18:00,651 --> 01:18:05,651
it's easy to remember that anybody doing
this job is very lucky to be able to do

1644
01:18:06,081 --> 01:18:08,750
this job.
And for me like,

1645
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:10,760
uh,
I don't think,

1646
01:18:11,210 --> 01:18:15,530
I think in a lot of ways the modern
media and industry have sorta not ruined

1647
01:18:15,531 --> 01:18:18,800
music,
but it's made it really hard for people

1648
01:18:18,801 --> 01:18:20,510
to focus on what is really about,
you know,

1649
01:18:20,511 --> 01:18:23,510
it's like life is all of a sudden one
big episode of the voice.

1650
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:28,420
And it's all about the year end lists
and who says this is better than what?

1651
01:18:28,421 --> 01:18:31,210
And seen somebody,
the artists better than somebody art and

1652
01:18:31,220 --> 01:18:33,500
I just don't think that that's ever like
a healthy thing,

1653
01:18:34,550 --> 01:18:36,800
if that makes sense.
Making a competition out of something

1654
01:18:36,801 --> 01:18:38,870
that's supposed to make everybody feel
included.

1655
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:43,430
Well it's definitely contrary to what
seems to be your primary focus,

1656
01:18:43,431 --> 01:18:46,580
which is making the best music for you,
for your expression.

1657
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:48,860
D,
expressing yourself in the best way you

1658
01:18:48,861 --> 01:18:51,830
can and making something that's going to
impact people in a,

1659
01:18:51,831 --> 01:18:54,190
in a,
in a way where your thoughts are going

1660
01:18:54,191 --> 01:18:56,060
to get across,
they're going to be moved by it.

1661
01:18:56,510 --> 01:18:59,270
You can't do that.
If you're thinking about winning awards,

1662
01:18:59,310 --> 01:19:04,310
a contract selling lots of or selling or
any of those things like promoting it

1663
01:19:04,311 --> 01:19:05,470
business,
you know,

1664
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:09,710
like anytime you,
you not to say that it's impossible.

1665
01:19:09,770 --> 01:19:12,980
I mean there is there it's horrible.
Like some people do sell a lot of

1666
01:19:12,981 --> 01:19:14,750
records.
Impacting people's lives with great

1667
01:19:14,751 --> 01:19:16,890
music is out there.
Music sells.

1668
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:17,880
Yeah.
Period.

1669
01:19:17,881 --> 01:19:20,810
It always finds a way.
I mean it's going to sell whether your.

1670
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:23,570
But like,
did you see amy,

1671
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:27,170
amy,
amy winehouse documentary on her

1672
01:19:27,171 --> 01:19:27,470
records?

1673
01:19:27,470 --> 01:19:29,720
That's what I heard the DAP kings for,
for this new one man.

1674
01:19:29,721 --> 01:19:32,450
Just the sound of what they did on those
albums.

1675
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:35,300
Amazing.
She's such as musician.

1676
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:38,850
She was so like her sound,
what she put together was so high.

1677
01:19:39,140 --> 01:19:43,280
But to see how the intense pressure of
being,

1678
01:19:43,281 --> 01:19:46,250
you know,
amy winehouse in quotes mean she was,

1679
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:50,840
or Justin Bieber or anybody else.
He likes that surrounded by enablers and

1680
01:19:50,841 --> 01:19:53,440
kept copacetic all the time and just.
Yes,

1681
01:19:53,441 --> 01:19:54,190
yes,
yes.

1682
01:19:54,190 --> 01:19:56,300
You know,
you got to do other things man.

1683
01:19:56,570 --> 01:19:58,340
You gotta be grounded,
you know,

1684
01:19:58,341 --> 01:20:01,280
and I think you've got to go home and
roll around and play with blocks.

1685
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:04,730
Yep.
That's what got to do to get in the pool

1686
01:20:04,731 --> 01:20:08,190
with them.
They surf on my back.

1687
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:10,380
I go under water and swim and they try
to stand on me.

1688
01:20:12,430 --> 01:20:15,930
It's hard to hold your breath for as
long as it takes for five-year-old.

1689
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:18,490
Stand on your back as you're floating.
But,

1690
01:20:19,030 --> 01:20:23,760
but I mean other things as well,
like as far as not just family and loved

1691
01:20:23,761 --> 01:20:26,070
ones and friends,
which are definitely important.

1692
01:20:26,071 --> 01:20:29,160
But I also think that other disciplines
are important.

1693
01:20:29,161 --> 01:20:32,370
Other focuses of other things that are
equally interested in,

1694
01:20:32,850 --> 01:20:34,470
you know,
because they alleviate some of the

1695
01:20:34,471 --> 01:20:39,471
pressure of what it is to be singularly
focused on one thing which we can get to

1696
01:20:40,621 --> 01:20:43,370
the point of madness in know unit does.
Yeah.

1697
01:20:44,310 --> 01:20:47,600
I got a drum kit I got really into
playing drums but six months ago just

1698
01:20:47,601 --> 01:20:48,890
to.
It's meditational man,

1699
01:20:48,891 --> 01:20:52,370
you have to relax to do it well and
you're not thinking about anything else.

1700
01:20:52,371 --> 01:20:53,510
And once I realized that,
I was like,

1701
01:20:53,511 --> 01:20:55,040
oh,
this is really good for me.

1702
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:58,160
And uh,
but yeah,

1703
01:20:58,161 --> 01:20:58,881
that's my thing.
I'm.

1704
01:20:58,881 --> 01:21:02,840
So this music thing,
once it becomes a career,

1705
01:21:03,260 --> 01:21:07,250
you have to be singularly focused.
Especially when thinking about a record

1706
01:21:07,251 --> 01:21:08,084
man,
my wife,

1707
01:21:08,150 --> 01:21:12,980
she just kind of leaves me alone
while she sees me go to that weird

1708
01:21:12,990 --> 01:21:14,750
platelet processing place.
You know what I mean?

1709
01:21:14,751 --> 01:21:15,584
Because it's like she,
you know,

1710
01:21:15,590 --> 01:21:18,560
it's like nothing else is in the room
anyway for awhile and then I'm done and

1711
01:21:18,561 --> 01:21:20,870
you just feel like,
okay,

1712
01:21:20,890 --> 01:21:22,130
and then you don't write a song for a
year.

1713
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:26,510
Well she seems very smart and support.
She could recognize that that's,

1714
01:21:26,730 --> 01:21:30,420
that's so important.
I have friends that are in relationships

1715
01:21:30,510 --> 01:21:35,510
where the wife is not very supportive
and it resists the creative process and

1716
01:21:35,751 --> 01:21:37,620
it gives them,
it doesn't understand it or

1717
01:21:37,690 --> 01:21:41,410
cheers was very creative too.
So she understands very independent.

1718
01:21:41,411 --> 01:21:44,930
So it's been an only child,
you know,

1719
01:21:44,950 --> 01:21:47,050
I,
she knows like there's just some times

1720
01:21:47,051 --> 01:21:50,010
where I have to go and be a mom.

1721
01:21:50,130 --> 01:21:50,963
Yeah,
space.

1722
01:21:52,330 --> 01:21:55,810
I just don't think you get to work
you're doing right now.

1723
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:58,300
I don't think you get to that state
unless you're a little crazy.

1724
01:21:58,870 --> 01:22:01,480
You have to be.
You got to be locked into it,

1725
01:22:01,481 --> 01:22:02,370
man.
You know,

1726
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:06,760
like by the way,
I'm so sorry I leaked the name of your

1727
01:22:06,761 --> 01:22:07,960
album out it.
I love it.

1728
01:22:08,170 --> 01:22:11,260
I love it.
I really did on Instagram,

1729
01:22:11,261 --> 01:22:15,140
but it was fucking good man.
I was in the gym and uh,

1730
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:16,510
and I said,
God damn,

1731
01:22:16,511 --> 01:22:19,210
people got to hear about this.
I was so high.

1732
01:22:19,510 --> 01:22:22,870
I was in Colorado and when you get high
in Colorado,

1733
01:22:22,930 --> 01:22:25,930
when you're at 8,000 feet or Utah,
actually 8,000 feet,

1734
01:22:27,010 --> 01:22:28,900
it just hits you in some crazy,
uh,

1735
01:22:28,990 --> 01:22:31,900
you feel like you're on a spaceship,
like on top of the world,

1736
01:22:31,901 --> 01:22:32,710
like your,
you're like,

1737
01:22:32,710 --> 01:22:36,640
I was feeling like I was connected to
the world and some really weird way and

1738
01:22:36,641 --> 01:22:39,580
it was at the gym just barbecued and
that,

1739
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:44,700
that album was so.
It was so good,

1740
01:22:44,831 --> 01:22:48,580
especially in that moment at the gym.
Endorphins flowing.

1741
01:22:50,230 --> 01:22:52,000
And then he sent me a text,
hey man,

1742
01:22:52,001 --> 01:22:53,440
I think he leaked the name of the album.

1743
01:22:56,230 --> 01:22:57,250
I went,
oh no,

1744
01:22:57,251 --> 01:22:58,270
I didn't even think of that

1745
01:23:00,610 --> 01:23:03,480
man feel.
Honestly at this point it's uh,

1746
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:06,070
this is definitely a record that

1747
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:09,580
anybody that knows about me,
I would like them to hear as a record

1748
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:12,130
because that's how I wrote,
recorded it to be heard.

1749
01:23:12,540 --> 01:23:14,860
Well,
that's one of the interesting aspects of

1750
01:23:14,861 --> 01:23:15,700
it.
Yeah.

1751
01:23:15,850 --> 01:23:20,760
It's obviously I'm one piece.
Yeah.

1752
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:22,590
Well,
you um,

1753
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:25,390
you sent me two versions of it,
it was kind of cool to,

1754
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:29,770
or the people did,
they sent me one version which is just

1755
01:23:29,860 --> 01:23:34,860
one recording and then the other one is
side two and then another one where all

1756
01:23:35,801 --> 01:23:38,110
the songs were broken down individually
song.

1757
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:39,970
But it almost feels like I shouldn't be
looking at that,

1758
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:42,190
you know?
I mean ideally I would,

1759
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:46,330
that's not how I wasn't designed to be
heard,

1760
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:51,070
broken apart I guess.
But people like to hear like one song,

1761
01:23:51,071 --> 01:23:54,820
if they're in the car for 10 minutes on
the way home to like to hear one song,

1762
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:55,810
it's not a bad thing.

1763
01:23:56,260 --> 01:24:00,040
Know all of my favorite records,
like have my top four or five records

1764
01:24:00,041 --> 01:24:04,300
are all concept records and most of them
are in song cycle,

1765
01:24:04,301 --> 01:24:06,940
which is
what they call it.

1766
01:24:06,941 --> 01:24:08,260
Like you know,
like dark side of the moon where it's

1767
01:24:08,261 --> 01:24:11,500
just one continuous wall,
the wall or the wall or what's going on.

1768
01:24:11,730 --> 01:24:16,730
But Marvin Gaye,
what's going on was one console and song

1769
01:24:16,931 --> 01:24:21,250
cycle that was written from the
narrative of a Vietnam vet returning

1770
01:24:21,251 --> 01:24:24,400
home to like an inner city home.
And trying to adapt to society.

1771
01:24:24,401 --> 01:24:26,260
Again,
it's a heavy album man.

1772
01:24:26,650 --> 01:24:30,160
And then astral weeks by Van Morrison,
if you've ever heard that record,

1773
01:24:30,161 --> 01:24:32,200
that's some powerful dope.
No,

1774
01:24:32,201 --> 01:24:33,050
I haven't.
Um,

1775
01:24:33,250 --> 01:24:35,680
it's all about the journey of your soul.
The soul's life.

1776
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:39,050
Whoa.
I never got into van Morrison other than

1777
01:24:39,620 --> 01:24:43,690
she's one of my favorite songs ever.
I always wonder what that was.

1778
01:24:43,890 --> 01:24:46,810
That's what he called his commercial
album because astral weeks,

1779
01:24:46,870 --> 01:24:49,410
although it's now considered probably
one of the greatest records ever

1780
01:24:49,420 --> 01:24:53,200
recorded in silvery will because it was
two RC for a lot of people.

1781
01:24:53,201 --> 01:24:55,540
So then he turned around and
intentionally made a more commercially

1782
01:24:55,541 --> 01:24:59,290
accessible album.
She was moondance and course sold a

1783
01:24:59,291 --> 01:25:02,560
gazillion copies.
Whenever I think about Marvin Gaye,

1784
01:25:02,650 --> 01:25:06,850
I think about this check that date
because when Marvin Gaye got shot and

1785
01:25:06,851 --> 01:25:09,850
killed by his dad here in La,
right?

1786
01:25:10,180 --> 01:25:14,770
I don't know where he was in Los Angeles
by a tragic story.

1787
01:25:14,830 --> 01:25:16,870
He got shot and killed by his own
father.

1788
01:25:17,410 --> 01:25:20,560
The girl I was dating goes,
what kind of a horrible person must have

1789
01:25:20,590 --> 01:25:24,240
been that his dad shot him.
I went,

1790
01:25:24,740 --> 01:25:27,970
what
worked?

1791
01:25:30,570 --> 01:25:34,780
But that was how she viewed the world.
Like your father shot you.

1792
01:25:35,020 --> 01:25:37,300
You must have been a horrible person.
So fuck,

1793
01:25:37,780 --> 01:25:40,600
fuck him.
He's probably my favorite musician.

1794
01:25:40,601 --> 01:25:43,870
Veltassa.
I'll know more about Marvin Gaye then we

1795
01:25:43,871 --> 01:25:46,630
want to go into really as a really dark
story.

1796
01:25:46,690 --> 01:25:47,350
Yeah.
Yeah.

1797
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:49,270
The council,
he's a,

1798
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:52,380
there was a lot of that.
Him and his dad had things that stemmed

1799
01:25:52,381 --> 01:25:56,770
from childhood things.
Dad was a preacher one but also a cross

1800
01:25:56,771 --> 01:25:59,860
dresser.
And so Marvin I think was ridiculed a

1801
01:25:59,861 --> 01:26:02,650
lot and Carlotta shamed for that and his
dad was very strict,

1802
01:26:03,530 --> 01:26:04,550
really tyrannical

1803
01:26:04,970 --> 01:26:07,460
rule in the house and beat his mom a
lot.

1804
01:26:09,530 --> 01:26:14,530
So a lot of Marvin sexual deviancy later
on and they think probably stemmed from,

1805
01:26:15,210 --> 01:26:17,270
from some of that.
But I mean it was just a really highly

1806
01:26:17,271 --> 01:26:21,520
sensitive guy and in a genius at that,
uh,

1807
01:26:23,180 --> 01:26:27,620
don't know what kind of sexual deviancy
was he involved in war?

1808
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:28,790
You never heard that.
I'm like,

1809
01:26:28,810 --> 01:26:31,230
err the gas dirty laundry.
But if there's books about it he's

1810
01:26:31,250 --> 01:26:32,540
doing,
he's like s and m bondage.

1811
01:26:32,541 --> 01:26:36,030
I think he had a free,
pretty substantial porn collection.

1812
01:26:36,130 --> 01:26:36,950
Oh,
okay.

1813
01:26:36,950 --> 01:26:39,970
Like the talk has a 17 year old
girlfriends and the [inaudible] and

1814
01:26:39,980 --> 01:26:42,440
threesomes and that kind of thing.
That was illegal back then.

1815
01:26:43,070 --> 01:26:44,140
He was just living,
Bro,

1816
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:50,510
got on the radio and it went from there.
But I think after the height of his fame

1817
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:54,920
and he was best selling record,
he was married to the daughter of the

1818
01:26:54,921 --> 01:26:59,921
president of motown or sister or one of
the other and she divorced him basically

1819
01:27:00,471 --> 01:27:03,830
and took everything like the whole
fortune and to smoking crack in a bread

1820
01:27:03,831 --> 01:27:06,560
truck and Hawaii and him.

1821
01:27:06,740 --> 01:27:09,170
This is after he's Marvin fucking gay.
You know what I mean?

1822
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:11,090
Yeah.
And then,

1823
01:27:11,091 --> 01:27:13,100
uh,
just went down hill from there.

1824
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:16,910
Nobody could get to him or help him out.
So we had to move back in with his

1825
01:27:16,911 --> 01:27:21,020
parents as a grown ass man and while
he's Marvin fucking gay.

1826
01:27:21,050 --> 01:27:25,070
And then they think a lot of people say
that's where the source of all the

1827
01:27:25,071 --> 01:27:28,580
trauma and pain him going back to that,
at that stage in his life was the worst

1828
01:27:28,581 --> 01:27:30,260
thing that could have happened.
Being around his dad,

1829
01:27:30,710 --> 01:27:32,900
his dad apparently had an argument and
he,

1830
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:36,530
uh,
told his dad like if he ever touched his

1831
01:27:36,531 --> 01:27:39,290
mom again,
he killed him and his dad said,

1832
01:27:39,291 --> 01:27:40,670
well,
if you ever lay a hand on me,

1833
01:27:40,671 --> 01:27:43,580
I'll kill you.
And I think on some people speculate

1834
01:27:43,610 --> 01:27:46,650
that Marvin was just so done with all of
it.

1835
01:27:46,670 --> 01:27:50,510
The fame and everything that he knew by
punching his father,

1836
01:27:50,570 --> 01:27:55,570
it would get him out of it was dad shot
him twice upstairs in the bedroom.

1837
01:27:56,150 --> 01:27:58,690
Oh my God.
And then the,

1838
01:27:58,780 --> 01:28:02,270
I think he laid there for about 20
minutes bleeding in the that the

1839
01:28:02,300 --> 01:28:04,160
ambulance showed up.
The paramedics couldn't come into the

1840
01:28:04,161 --> 01:28:06,680
House as long as the dad was still in
there with the gun.

1841
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:10,490
So I think his sister in law brother
somebody to come in and like find the

1842
01:28:10,491 --> 01:28:11,800
gun that his father had hidden.
Who's?

1843
01:28:11,810 --> 01:28:13,530
He wasn't talking.
Oh Man.

1844
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:15,560
It took.
So by the time they got him out of the

1845
01:28:15,561 --> 01:28:18,110
house,
Marvin died in the ambulance to the

1846
01:28:18,111 --> 01:28:18,944
hospital.

1847
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:22,593
Woo.

1848
01:28:23,930 --> 01:28:25,220
That's heavy man.

1849
01:28:26,050 --> 01:28:26,883
Fuck

1850
01:28:28,740 --> 01:28:33,740
what a crazy story really said.
It is a terrible story.

1851
01:28:36,810 --> 01:28:39,120
It's you always.
When you,

1852
01:28:39,121 --> 01:28:44,121
when you hear about a guy that has this,
it's almost like overwhelming desire to

1853
01:28:52,421 --> 01:28:54,160
express himself,
you know,

1854
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:58,210
like when you have a song like what's
going on or if you have a song like a

1855
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:00,970
let's get it on,
you know,

1856
01:29:01,180 --> 01:29:01,990
devastating.

1857
01:29:01,990 --> 01:29:06,990
Come on.
I mean there's some intense memory

1858
01:29:07,980 --> 01:29:12,780
because emotional connection to what
he's doing is just so off the charts and

1859
01:29:12,810 --> 01:29:17,810
a lot of times that's almost like
energized by dark moments in your life.

1860
01:29:19,590 --> 01:29:23,170
Oh yeah.
Dark memories could,

1861
01:29:23,171 --> 01:29:26,010
it overwhelms those,
those pot.

1862
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:29,910
Even the positive things.
You showed me a happy well adjusted

1863
01:29:29,911 --> 01:29:32,550
artists and I'll show you some boring
fucking art road.

1864
01:29:35,710 --> 01:29:37,410
Yeah,
let's get it on.

1865
01:29:37,570 --> 01:29:40,620
Shit that you got a girl that likes to
get.

1866
01:29:40,621 --> 01:29:43,140
Let's get it on.
You got a good one.

1867
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:46,320
He,
I think she was 17 when he wrote that

1868
01:29:46,321 --> 01:29:48,810
album for really a little young
mistress.

1869
01:29:49,230 --> 01:29:50,400
Jesus,
that's dark.

1870
01:29:50,460 --> 01:29:55,460
Telling her how much he wanted to do the
deed for record 17.

1871
01:29:56,550 --> 01:29:59,880
So there's a song called really love to
ball

1872
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:02,640
landed that album.
Really?

1873
01:30:02,670 --> 01:30:04,650
Yeah.
And it's just like women moaning and

1874
01:30:04,651 --> 01:30:08,680
orgasm and really goes was fearless man.
Shit.

1875
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:12,030
Just get away with it too.
At that time it was probably sold so

1876
01:30:12,031 --> 01:30:13,110
many records,
so I

1877
01:30:15,150 --> 01:30:16,470
didn't tour.
He never toured.

1878
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:17,820
Really?
Hardly ever really.

1879
01:30:17,821 --> 01:30:19,710
Couldn't drag him out on stage.
No.

1880
01:30:19,711 --> 01:30:23,130
Shit really.
I think when,

1881
01:30:23,131 --> 01:30:24,840
when let's get it on,
was blowing up.

1882
01:30:24,841 --> 01:30:29,640
He was living in a cabin up in top of
Topanga Canyon with his girlfriend and

1883
01:30:29,641 --> 01:30:31,380
just hiding from the world doing blow.

1884
01:30:33,540 --> 01:30:36,600
Literally.
He played one concert that entire record

1885
01:30:36,601 --> 01:30:39,870
cycle.
That's where everybody lived back then.

1886
01:30:40,410 --> 01:30:45,030
I saw Hendrix house was for sale a few
years back as a house at Hendricks

1887
01:30:45,210 --> 01:30:46,980
bought.
They never moved into.

1888
01:30:47,250 --> 01:30:50,670
He bought it right before he died.
I'll take it.

1889
01:30:51,430 --> 01:30:54,030
Even if even if he did live there,
I'm like,

1890
01:30:54,031 --> 01:30:56,910
I'll still buy it.
I need to know if he.

1891
01:30:56,911 --> 01:30:59,450
If he.
Did he write something anywhere?

1892
01:30:59,451 --> 01:31:02,120
It was it in paper that he walk in and
he was there.

1893
01:31:02,180 --> 01:31:05,550
He probably,
he must have bought it so he had to look

1894
01:31:05,551 --> 01:31:06,810
at it.
So if you looked at it,

1895
01:31:06,930 --> 01:31:08,730
he was in there.
So he walked around.

1896
01:31:09,150 --> 01:31:11,780
I take it.
He probably bone the realtor.

1897
01:31:12,710 --> 01:31:14,340
Fucking take it.
Well,

1898
01:31:14,341 --> 01:31:17,820
there was a house that was for sale that
was wilt Chamberlain's house that had

1899
01:31:17,821 --> 01:31:20,490
the whole deal.
It had a circular bed that spun around.

1900
01:31:20,670 --> 01:31:24,050
It was like the ultimate fuck castle and
you know,

1901
01:31:24,470 --> 01:31:28,560
will chamberlain on his way to Bang in
10,000 different women allegedly

1902
01:31:28,770 --> 01:31:30,220
according to him,
you know,

1903
01:31:30,230 --> 01:31:33,120
and he had just this insane bachelor
pad.

1904
01:31:33,390 --> 01:31:35,190
That was just.
How did he get anything else?

1905
01:31:35,191 --> 01:31:36,060
Look at it.
Look at it.

1906
01:31:36,490 --> 01:31:38,700
That's this house.
Look at that bad.

1907
01:31:38,730 --> 01:31:42,090
That's the way it looks like the enter
the Dragon.

1908
01:31:42,390 --> 01:31:47,390
Mr Han's fucking palace or something
is going on there,

1909
01:31:47,491 --> 01:31:49,090
bro.
Fuck yeah.

1910
01:31:49,110 --> 01:31:52,030
I'd be walking around and they're like
trying to find myself in the mirror.

1911
01:31:52,290 --> 01:31:57,290
Oh look at that shit a few years back.
That house is that the outside of it.

1912
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:03,520
A few years back the house was for sale.
It's an epic epic house.

1913
01:32:03,980 --> 01:32:05,950
Like I'll fuck my dog too.
I'm not afraid.

1914
01:32:05,980 --> 01:32:10,270
But they had a really hard time selling
it because it was worth a lot of money.

1915
01:32:10,271 --> 01:32:11,260
That place,
man,

1916
01:32:11,740 --> 01:32:14,650
it was worth a lot of money and it
wasn't the kind of house that a normal

1917
01:32:14,651 --> 01:32:18,100
person could live in one bedroom
chamberlain's bungalow.

1918
01:32:18,380 --> 01:32:21,540
Would you see that now?
Look at the pool tables like whereas

1919
01:32:21,550 --> 01:32:22,450
knees are.

1920
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:28,570
It's hilarious.
I wonder if that house ever sold.

1921
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:31,360
It might be one of those things that you
just keep selling them buying,

1922
01:32:31,390 --> 01:32:35,830
but it's really funky.
Like modern for the 19 eighties.

1923
01:32:35,831 --> 01:32:38,170
Look in the crew man.
Oh yeah man,

1924
01:32:38,171 --> 01:32:40,270
look at that place.
It's all angular and shit.

1925
01:32:40,540 --> 01:32:43,840
Like a transformer to two and a half
acres.

1926
01:32:44,140 --> 01:32:45,450
Like it's.
You're expected to go

1927
01:32:47,590 --> 01:32:49,230
something like that.
So for now here,

1928
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:50,920
even if it wasn't wilt Chamberlain's
house,

1929
01:32:50,921 --> 01:32:54,490
what's something that's a $10,000,000,
$10,000,000 depending on where it is.

1930
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:56,400
If that's in the Hollywood hills.
Yeah.

1931
01:32:56,500 --> 01:32:59,950
That fucking crazy palace with the wave
pool is like,

1932
01:32:59,951 --> 01:33:02,860
look at all the.
I mean that's a piece of art that's not

1933
01:33:02,861 --> 01:33:05,500
just a house.
You'd have to have the right buyer.

1934
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:08,320
What am I real estate guy flipping
houses all of a sudden,

1935
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:09,513
fuck.
Do I know?

1936
01:33:10,170 --> 01:33:11,710
I don't even know how much toothpaste
cost

1937
01:33:13,240 --> 01:33:14,590
telling you how much this house is.

1938
01:33:15,060 --> 01:33:16,780
I'd say 10 million now.
It's a good number.

1939
01:33:17,020 --> 01:33:20,470
I want to say it's dope house.
No less than 10 million.

1940
01:33:21,660 --> 01:33:25,030
Two thousand seven.
It was 10 point five.

1941
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:26,710
Bitch.
What the fuck?

1942
01:33:26,711 --> 01:33:31,711
I'm talking about white man tend to.
The point five is the negotiating.

1943
01:33:32,430 --> 01:33:34,420
That's where.
That's the wiggle room from 11 point

1944
01:33:34,421 --> 01:33:37,900
five,
so it's sold for eight years ago.

1945
01:33:37,901 --> 01:33:41,020
That's how much it was for sale.
It was listed at 11 point five.

1946
01:33:41,110 --> 01:33:42,940
Oh,
it was down to 10 point five.

1947
01:33:42,941 --> 01:33:45,550
So it might still be available.
No,

1948
01:33:45,551 --> 01:33:46,330
I bet.
Well,

1949
01:33:46,330 --> 01:33:48,370
I bet a house like that.
People buy it and they go,

1950
01:33:48,371 --> 01:33:50,470
what the fuck are we doing here?
Let's make some money.

1951
01:33:50,471 --> 01:33:52,120
It's in Bel Air and then they sell that
thing.

1952
01:33:52,150 --> 01:33:52,983
Oh,
bill there.

1953
01:33:53,380 --> 01:33:55,240
Yeah.
That's an expensive neighborhood.

1954
01:33:55,540 --> 01:33:59,230
Dope views must be good to be wilt
chamberlain back with no Internet.

1955
01:33:59,560 --> 01:34:01,150
No twitter,
no facebook.

1956
01:34:01,180 --> 01:34:02,890
Just all dick.
Yeah.

1957
01:34:02,891 --> 01:34:05,770
Those guys really just mean free for
all.

1958
01:34:05,860 --> 01:34:07,360
Oh yeah,
come on man.

1959
01:34:07,361 --> 01:34:08,620
It's chaos.
The president,

1960
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:11,260
President Kennedy was on a free for all.
I mean,

1961
01:34:11,261 --> 01:34:14,690
imagine that the president just call him
buck wild.

1962
01:34:14,770 --> 01:34:18,250
What's amazing is that everyone in the
news,

1963
01:34:18,490 --> 01:34:20,050
like all the reporters,
they all knew it.

1964
01:34:20,230 --> 01:34:21,160
Yeah,
they didn't.

1965
01:34:21,210 --> 01:34:23,830
They didn't talk about it.
It was me stories written about it.

1966
01:34:24,740 --> 01:34:26,770
Well,
I wonder what that shift was.

1967
01:34:27,340 --> 01:34:31,120
The shift was in America where they
decided that they were just going to

1968
01:34:31,121 --> 01:34:34,070
talk about everything.
Like what caused sold.

1969
01:34:34,630 --> 01:34:35,321
Yeah,
I guess so.

1970
01:34:35,321 --> 01:34:37,150
Right.
Once I figured out that's all people

1971
01:34:37,151 --> 01:34:42,151
want is gossip was like once there was
too many different distribution methods,

1972
01:34:42,911 --> 01:34:44,380
it seems like that's what it is.
Right?

1973
01:34:44,620 --> 01:34:48,580
Like if you only have like a couple of
different newspapers and a couple of

1974
01:34:48,581 --> 01:34:50,770
different television shows,
it can all be kind of controlled.

1975
01:34:50,810 --> 01:34:52,270
I monopolize go.
Yeah.

1976
01:34:52,271 --> 01:34:56,080
And you also put pressure on the
reporters probably did not reveal that

1977
01:34:56,081 --> 01:34:57,340
stuff and that.
And I'm,

1978
01:34:57,450 --> 01:34:58,030
it's,
you

1979
01:34:58,030 --> 01:35:00,500
know,
like something on the radio in the car

1980
01:35:00,501 --> 01:35:03,150
when I was coming here about,
there was a big data models today.

1981
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:04,490
Yeah.
Yeah.

1982
01:35:04,580 --> 01:35:07,340
I haven't gotten into it hurt the cliff
notes,

1983
01:35:07,341 --> 01:35:09,950
but it sounds pretty heavy.
It's supposed to be the biggest leak of

1984
01:35:09,951 --> 01:35:12,660
documentary millions of pages or.
Yeah,

1985
01:35:12,950 --> 01:35:17,060
and apparently it just shows all this
crazy collusion between world leaders

1986
01:35:17,061 --> 01:35:20,280
and financial.
I used to obsess about that shit and I

1987
01:35:20,281 --> 01:35:21,730
wanted to know,
you know,

1988
01:35:21,810 --> 01:35:25,250
like man,
but now at this stage in my life,

1989
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:26,833
I mean

1990
01:35:27,590 --> 01:35:32,570
I just go ahead and assume it's all
fucking crooked and so it is definitely

1991
01:35:32,571 --> 01:35:34,370
all crooked,
but you know what I think,

1992
01:35:34,371 --> 01:35:35,840
man,
I don't even think.

1993
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:37,520
I mean,
I think everybody's got to pay attention

1994
01:35:37,521 --> 01:35:39,530
to it obviously.
I mean we're all paying attention to it,

1995
01:35:39,531 --> 01:35:42,830
but I don't think it's sustainable.
I don't think you could do it anymore.

1996
01:35:43,130 --> 01:35:47,030
I think these leaks are going to come
more and more frequently and they're

1997
01:35:47,031 --> 01:35:49,850
going to be more and more accessible and
more and more easy to get.

1998
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,940
I just don't think you're gonna be able
to fuck people like that anymore.

1999
01:35:53,120 --> 01:35:54,980
I just don't think you could do it.
Even the government,

2000
01:35:55,340 --> 01:35:58,100
I don't think they could do it anymore.
I think what they're doing now,

2001
01:35:58,101 --> 01:36:00,140
even right now,
they're like Klingon,

2002
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:02,870
just hanging onto this thing while it's
shaken.

2003
01:36:02,871 --> 01:36:06,860
Apart around them,
because the apple fiasco and supposed to

2004
01:36:06,861 --> 01:36:08,150
be in control of us,
man,

2005
01:36:08,360 --> 01:36:09,230
that's the bottom line.

2006
01:36:09,330 --> 01:36:11,120
You're not supposed to be in control of
Jamie.

2007
01:36:11,250 --> 01:36:13,850
Jamie's not supposed to be in control of
me and the government's not supposed to

2008
01:36:13,851 --> 01:36:14,684
be in control.
You.

2009
01:36:14,870 --> 01:36:18,830
You're supposed to be some operating
principles that we all commune under and

2010
01:36:18,831 --> 01:36:22,370
our community should be established in a
way that benefits us.

2011
01:36:22,580 --> 01:36:24,830
Not the big banks,
not the politicians,

2012
01:36:24,950 --> 01:36:28,970
not fucking Hillary Clinton,
given $250,000 speaker speeches to a

2013
01:36:28,971 --> 01:36:32,480
bunch of Wall Street people.
That's all nonsense and that's some old

2014
01:36:32,481 --> 01:36:37,010
shit that we just assume we have to stay
with because it's been this way from the

2015
01:36:37,011 --> 01:36:39,170
jump.
It's been this way since we were kids.

2016
01:36:39,320 --> 01:36:42,580
While my parents grew up with it and
this is the system bullshit.

2017
01:36:42,770 --> 01:36:45,830
They're staying with this system.
Not because it's the best,

2018
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:49,400
but because they figure the best way to
extract money from it.

2019
01:36:49,670 --> 01:36:51,020
You can't.
You're not gonna be able to do it.

2020
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:53,900
It's not going to happen.
Once president trump gets in office,

2021
01:36:54,310 --> 01:36:57,920
everyone's going to realize what a
fucking God damn joke of a system we put

2022
01:36:57,921 --> 01:37:02,120
in place and there'll be some real talk
about having some kind of a radical

2023
01:37:02,121 --> 01:37:02,954
reform.

2024
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:09,820
Like what if they could just fire
members of the Senate or the House

2025
01:37:09,821 --> 01:37:12,220
representatives or congress that you're
fired.

2026
01:37:12,830 --> 01:37:15,340
You can't just say,
we're not going to do our jobs.

2027
01:37:15,950 --> 01:37:16,783
Yeah.

2028
01:37:17,470 --> 01:37:19,810
Well,
dishes too many people that you don't

2029
01:37:19,811 --> 01:37:23,920
know that have any say whatsoever on how
you live your life,

2030
01:37:24,310 --> 01:37:29,140
like the idea that the Senate or that
Congress or that the Supreme Court and

2031
01:37:29,141 --> 01:37:33,820
these people could sit down and decide
like what you can can't do with your

2032
01:37:33,821 --> 01:37:36,400
body,
what substances you can or can't put

2033
01:37:36,401 --> 01:37:37,870
into them,
which shouldn't,

2034
01:37:37,871 --> 01:37:40,480
shouldn't be illegal like that.
You.

2035
01:37:40,540 --> 01:37:42,310
You shouldn't be able to decide that.

2036
01:37:42,460 --> 01:37:45,530
The Nixon thing the other day,
it was pretty interesting about where

2037
01:37:45,570 --> 01:37:46,480
they were just like,
yeah,

2038
01:37:46,481 --> 01:37:48,100
we should do anything.
We just,

2039
01:37:48,101 --> 01:37:49,150
you know.
Yeah.

2040
01:37:49,300 --> 01:37:51,410
We'll tell people what it was.
They.

2041
01:37:51,580 --> 01:37:53,230
There was a former aide,
I think.

2042
01:37:53,610 --> 01:37:54,550
Was that,
was that right?

2043
01:37:54,870 --> 01:37:56,680
Somebody in his.
Yeah.

2044
01:37:56,700 --> 01:38:00,090
Someone basically came out and said that
the war on drugs was propagated to

2045
01:38:00,091 --> 01:38:03,450
suppress minorities and a anti war
movement,

2046
01:38:03,451 --> 01:38:04,930
Antiwar Movement,
and they,

2047
01:38:04,931 --> 01:38:08,460
they knew that there was no threat there
and it wasn't doing anything harmful to

2048
01:38:08,461 --> 01:38:11,850
people and and basically they're on tape
talking about it and laughing.

2049
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:14,910
Unbelievable.
Somebody on late night the other night

2050
01:38:14,911 --> 01:38:16,830
when it came out,
they said it perfectly like that.

2051
01:38:16,860 --> 01:38:19,770
Even from the grave.
That guy manages to cultivate more

2052
01:38:19,771 --> 01:38:21,930
fucking hatred.
It was so crazy.

2053
01:38:22,270 --> 01:38:22,760
Dude.
What?

2054
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:23,610
Evil Bastard.

2055
01:38:23,980 --> 01:38:25,240
Yeah.
It was last week.

2056
01:38:25,270 --> 01:38:28,810
Quote from Richard Nixon's former chief
domestic advisor,

2057
01:38:28,811 --> 01:38:30,040
John Eric,
Eric,

2058
01:38:30,090 --> 01:38:35,090
Min e h r I c h Dot Heckman surfaced
confirming a disgusting truth that's

2059
01:38:38,171 --> 01:38:42,130
been very well known by black folks for
for several decades of war on drugs.

2060
01:38:42,131 --> 01:38:44,590
Had nothing to do with eradicating it
drug epidemic.

2061
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:47,890
Instead,
it was a ploy to hide for the

2062
01:38:47,891 --> 01:38:52,070
intentional targeting and decimating of
the black community.

2063
01:38:52,120 --> 01:38:55,120
Well,
as well as the real thing.

2064
01:38:55,330 --> 01:38:58,960
This is Eric Men's words.
He said the Nixon campaign in 1968 in

2065
01:38:58,961 --> 01:39:01,630
the Nixon White House after that had two
enemies.

2066
01:39:01,690 --> 01:39:05,260
The antiwar left and black people.
You understand what I'm saying?

2067
01:39:05,290 --> 01:39:08,830
We knew that we couldn't make it illegal
to be either against the war or black,

2068
01:39:08,831 --> 01:39:11,650
but by getting the public to associate
the hippies with marijuana and the

2069
01:39:11,651 --> 01:39:14,350
blacks with heroin and then
criminalizing both heavily,

2070
01:39:14,351 --> 01:39:16,420
we could disrupt those communities.
Wow.

2071
01:39:16,540 --> 01:39:18,700
We could arrest their leaders,
raid their homes,

2072
01:39:18,701 --> 01:39:22,390
break up their meetings,
and vilify them night after night on the

2073
01:39:22,390 --> 01:39:23,170
evening news.

2074
01:39:23,170 --> 01:39:26,920
Holy fucking shit.
Did we know we were lying about drugs?

2075
01:39:27,160 --> 01:39:29,260
Of course we did.
Whoa.

2076
01:39:30,190 --> 01:39:32,050
Damn.
That's dark.

2077
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:35,050
That guy's only concentrating on black
people though.

2078
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:39,160
Do you go to an all black site that guys
just wants to talk about?

2079
01:39:39,161 --> 01:39:42,610
The black part is you got a big smiling
black phase.

2080
01:39:43,390 --> 01:39:46,390
The whole thing is disgusting.
It's disgusting that we live under the

2081
01:39:46,391 --> 01:39:49,120
echoes of all these morons that were
running the country back then.

2082
01:39:49,121 --> 01:39:53,350
All these creeps that could get away
with shit just like wilt chamberlains up

2083
01:39:53,351 --> 01:39:56,770
there banging up a storm and Marvin
Gaye's cooked up into pain canyon with a

2084
01:39:56,771 --> 01:39:58,870
17 year old.
You can get away with anything back

2085
01:39:58,871 --> 01:40:00,430
then.
Apparently.

2086
01:40:00,431 --> 01:40:01,960
You still can't.
R Kelly.

2087
01:40:02,290 --> 01:40:06,670
Paula r Kelly allegedly,
but that's,

2088
01:40:06,671 --> 01:40:07,504
you know,

2089
01:40:08,490 --> 01:40:10,240
Dick Cheney,
you could just shoot people the fucking

2090
01:40:10,250 --> 01:40:12,040
face.
Literally.

2091
01:40:12,100 --> 01:40:12,933
Yeah.
Literally.

2092
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:14,920
Well those.
Do you know what he was doing?

2093
01:40:15,790 --> 01:40:18,370
It's a canned hunt.
So those are weird man.

2094
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,610
Do you know what that is?
That's really go out and you're

2095
01:40:21,611 --> 01:40:25,780
basically guaranteed a trophy.
No bird hunting.

2096
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:28,710
So what happens is they go out and they
um,

2097
01:40:28,780 --> 01:40:32,890
they open up these fucking boxes of
birds and the birds fly out and they

2098
01:40:32,891 --> 01:40:37,450
shoot them and he's still shot somebody
in the face to face and he didn't talk

2099
01:40:37,451 --> 01:40:39,970
about.
He wouldn't talk to anybody for like 16

2100
01:40:39,971 --> 01:40:43,360
hours afterwards was probably hammered.
He was hammered,

2101
01:40:43,740 --> 01:40:45,790
man.
Most likely he was hammered.

2102
01:40:46,210 --> 01:40:47,980
Allegedly.
Allegedly.

2103
01:40:49,160 --> 01:40:51,010
Can you still sue?
Even though it doesn't have a heart,

2104
01:40:51,190 --> 01:40:53,380
it was like an artificial heart.
She's still out of Su,

2105
01:40:54,490 --> 01:40:57,280
but he shot his friend in his face and
his friend apologized.

2106
01:40:57,760 --> 01:40:59,680
That's how fucking gangster Dick Cheney
is.

2107
01:41:01,490 --> 01:41:06,100
While his friend was like 60 walked it
off when she walked in front of your

2108
01:41:06,101 --> 01:41:06,934
bullets,
Bro,

2109
01:41:07,780 --> 01:41:10,120
they would probably live out of their
fucking mind.

2110
01:41:10,840 --> 01:41:15,840
Just that you want to talk about ptsd.
Do you imagine the demons inside the

2111
01:41:16,481 --> 01:41:18,630
brain of Dick Cheney,
the,

2112
01:41:18,760 --> 01:41:22,570
just knowing what he knows,
could you imagine?

2113
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:25,920
I mean,
if that guy has an ounce of self

2114
01:41:25,921 --> 01:41:28,220
realization,
an ounce of,

2115
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:30,880
of objectivity,
of introspective thought,

2116
01:41:30,910 --> 01:41:34,750
whereas really thinks about it than I do
the right thing was I do think.

2117
01:41:35,150 --> 01:41:35,983
Do you think,
um,

2118
01:41:36,700 --> 01:41:38,890
that um,
weapons of mass destruction,

2119
01:41:38,900 --> 01:41:41,590
you think that was cool?
Was that okay?

2120
01:41:41,650 --> 01:41:44,090
There's only a few hundred thousand
dollars a million people died,

2121
01:41:44,091 --> 01:41:46,630
but that it was probably for the best
historically.

2122
01:41:46,930 --> 01:41:47,920
I mean,
they were going to die anyway.

2123
01:41:47,921 --> 01:41:49,690
It's not like there are a million of
mortals,

2124
01:41:50,020 --> 01:41:50,853
right?

2125
01:41:51,210 --> 01:41:53,290
I mean,
what you're asking about,

2126
01:41:53,320 --> 01:41:57,610
do I think he was president?
Dick Cheney seeks daily affirmation.

2127
01:41:58,550 --> 01:42:02,770
Well,
he's a biblical character in that right

2128
01:42:02,771 --> 01:42:05,290
after he had done all these things
right,

2129
01:42:05,770 --> 01:42:08,590
but he'd clearly pulled the strings to
get us into Iraq.

2130
01:42:08,591 --> 01:42:12,040
And there's clearly financial motives.
I mean,

2131
01:42:12,041 --> 01:42:16,020
he was the god Damn Ceo of the company
that got into no bid,

2132
01:42:16,030 --> 01:42:18,310
billion dollar contract.
Palpatine man,

2133
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:20,230
he's a damn sith Lord.
Like Bush,

2134
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:22,600
like him or hate him.
He thought he was doing the right thing.

2135
01:42:22,601 --> 01:42:25,990
You know the guy believed,
but this is the thing to undeniable

2136
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:29,590
biblical thing about him.
So the guy has a ton of heart attacks,

2137
01:42:29,591 --> 01:42:30,424
right?
Yeah.

2138
01:42:30,850 --> 01:42:35,500
They replaced his fucking heart.
They replaced his valves with some

2139
01:42:35,501 --> 01:42:40,501
machine and this machine constantly pump
blood to the point where he didn't have

2140
01:42:41,141 --> 01:42:43,900
a pulse.
It was a constant flow.

2141
01:42:44,410 --> 01:42:48,250
So if you put your finger on Dick Cheney
while he had this artificial heart in

2142
01:42:48,251 --> 01:42:51,220
place,
he wouldn't have a pulse.

2143
01:42:51,730 --> 01:42:54,190
Started vader.
He's dark vader.

2144
01:42:54,220 --> 01:42:57,150
He's fucking darth vader.
Like the old man at the era,

2145
01:42:57,190 --> 01:43:00,090
the promethium that was pretending to be
dead and shit.

2146
01:43:00,100 --> 01:43:02,110
You pull.
Make sure that's true.

2147
01:43:02,200 --> 01:43:04,420
I'm pretty sure I'm correct about that.
Jamie.

2148
01:43:05,290 --> 01:43:09,610
Pull that up about about Dick Cheney's
heart being artificial and not having a

2149
01:43:09,611 --> 01:43:10,291
pulse.
Okay.

2150
01:43:10,291 --> 01:43:11,650
Yeah.
I was just reading about the actual

2151
01:43:11,651 --> 01:43:15,130
event and how it happened and he shot
him in the face and they blamed the guy

2152
01:43:15,490 --> 01:43:17,520
waiting this name for walking in front
of them.

2153
01:43:21,940 --> 01:43:23,800
Had a fucking idiot.
Listen,

2154
01:43:23,801 --> 01:43:25,840
man,
you don't point your gun where people

2155
01:43:25,841 --> 01:43:27,610
are.
The guy didn't walk in front of you.

2156
01:43:28,060 --> 01:43:30,610
That's crazy.
As a person who fires guns,

2157
01:43:30,760 --> 01:43:33,100
you don't ever point your gun anywhere
near a person.

2158
01:43:33,250 --> 01:43:36,550
If a person walks in front and you pull
your gun away from where that person is,

2159
01:43:37,300 --> 01:43:41,380
if you have to be aware of your left and
your right at all times,

2160
01:43:41,500 --> 01:43:44,800
you don't stand in front of somebody.
The guy didn't just.

2161
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:49,210
It's not that guys fault bionic.
Dick Cheney technically has no pulse

2162
01:43:49,270 --> 01:43:52,180
here.
It goes during recent heart surgery at

2163
01:43:52,181 --> 01:43:56,450
doctors and planted a ventricular assist
device to augment Cheney's failing

2164
01:43:56,451 --> 01:43:58,410
ticker,
but it also gives us critics and other

2165
01:43:58,411 --> 01:44:01,730
punch line to work with because the
device moves blood continuously.

2166
01:44:01,731 --> 01:44:04,280
It doesn't mimic the pulsating rhythm of
the heartbeat.

2167
01:44:04,430 --> 01:44:08,450
Tactically speaking,
Dick Cheney no longer has a pulse in

2168
01:44:08,650 --> 01:44:11,090
insert darth vader comparisons here.

2169
01:44:12,660 --> 01:44:17,540
This is a 2010 and that's still kicking.
That's amazing,

2170
01:44:17,541 --> 01:44:19,910
man.
I used to do this bit about Dick Cheney

2171
01:44:20,270 --> 01:44:22,760
where you had one extra secret service
agent,

2172
01:44:23,060 --> 01:44:26,240
like every other guy had five,
but he had six and this one,

2173
01:44:26,270 --> 01:44:29,480
they put them on like this all
vegetarian diet and they had to do

2174
01:44:29,481 --> 01:44:30,650
jogging every day.
He's like,

2175
01:44:30,651 --> 01:44:33,440
why the fuck do I have to jog?
And there was always a guy behind them

2176
01:44:33,590 --> 01:44:37,520
with a a giant cooler filled with ice.
And the moment Dick Cheney has a heart

2177
01:44:37,521 --> 01:44:39,080
attack,
they were going to take that dude out,

2178
01:44:39,320 --> 01:44:42,610
cut his chest open,
shove his heart inside a Dick Cheney and

2179
01:44:42,620 --> 01:44:46,940
Save Dick Cheney was one extra secret
service agent that was a sacrifice.

2180
01:44:49,160 --> 01:44:50,870
He's a dark guy,
man.

2181
01:44:51,380 --> 01:44:55,220
He,
he was the CEO of the company that

2182
01:44:55,221 --> 01:44:58,880
profited the most from them blowing shit
up in Iraq

2183
01:44:59,580 --> 01:45:04,580
rope
around the time that I was in the navy,

2184
01:45:04,870 --> 01:45:06,670
the uh,
they had this reimplemented,

2185
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:10,190
this anthrax vaccination policy and it's
a,

2186
01:45:10,200 --> 01:45:13,110
I think they've done it in the first
Gulf War Two and a lot of people think

2187
01:45:13,111 --> 01:45:17,040
is directly responsible for the Gulf War
syndrome and all those guys like dealing

2188
01:45:17,041 --> 01:45:20,850
with chronic muscle spasms and fatigue.
And really,

2189
01:45:20,940 --> 01:45:21,810
um,
so yeah,

2190
01:45:21,811 --> 01:45:24,690
but like they,
they came down the pipeline again.

2191
01:45:24,691 --> 01:45:26,910
They're gonna,
they're gonna make it a mandatory thing

2192
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:30,090
for everybody.
And then I think in [inaudible] 98,

2193
01:45:31,320 --> 01:45:33,450
they recalled it,
I can't remember.

2194
01:45:33,451 --> 01:45:36,780
[inaudible] 98 or 99 with the times and
all these people had already kind of dug

2195
01:45:36,781 --> 01:45:41,781
in and figured out that there was only
one lab in the entire world authorized

2196
01:45:42,751 --> 01:45:45,140
and regulated to manufacture the vaccine
call.

2197
01:45:45,160 --> 01:45:50,160
I think their lab was bioport up in
Michigan and one of the owners of the

2198
01:45:51,361 --> 01:45:55,290
lab was a former admiral of the navy and
also in the joint chiefs of staff

2199
01:45:55,310 --> 01:45:57,390
things.
Last thing was crow and this guy.

2200
01:45:57,391 --> 01:46:01,060
So you're telling me that dude didn't
know that this contract is major bit

2201
01:46:01,080 --> 01:46:05,460
multibillion dollar defense contract
coming down the pipeline and then jumps

2202
01:46:05,461 --> 01:46:08,180
in and buys this company,
you know,

2203
01:46:08,370 --> 01:46:11,310
to start pumping people with shit that
they have no idea.

2204
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:16,010
And they actually got the lab got shut
down while they're manufacturing all

2205
01:46:16,030 --> 01:46:19,560
this stuff.
Who knows how many hundreds of thousands

2206
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:20,430
of people had to put that shit in there

2207
01:46:22,200 --> 01:46:24,370
and they will fucking experiment on
soldiers.

2208
01:46:24,371 --> 01:46:28,570
They have done it in the past is the
precedent has been set a long time go.

2209
01:46:28,600 --> 01:46:30,130
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.

2210
01:46:30,250 --> 01:46:31,390
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.

2211
01:46:32,180 --> 01:46:35,500
I remember bootcamp.
You go down those cattle catalog and

2212
01:46:35,501 --> 01:46:39,070
there's like six people and you just
keep going through and you go through

2213
01:46:39,090 --> 01:46:42,400
with all of these shots,
guns that just.

2214
01:46:42,420 --> 01:46:44,620
I have no idea to this day where a lot
of it even was.

2215
01:46:44,621 --> 01:46:46,720
Man,
I got stationed overseas so we had to

2216
01:46:46,721 --> 01:46:49,890
take a bunch of typhoid and there's a
whole lot of shit on.

2217
01:46:49,930 --> 01:46:51,320
They don't even tell you what they're
putting in you,

2218
01:46:51,321 --> 01:46:53,310
you know,
for a week.

2219
01:46:53,311 --> 01:46:55,070
You can't lift your arms up.
Like

2220
01:46:56,370 --> 01:46:57,930
how fucked is that?
They don't have.

2221
01:46:59,020 --> 01:47:00,800
They don't have to tell you.
No.

2222
01:47:01,080 --> 01:47:06,080
That's crazy that they can just shoot
vaccinations in you and they don't have

2223
01:47:06,091 --> 01:47:06,960
to tell you what they're doing.

2224
01:47:08,580 --> 01:47:11,760
I refused to take them.
They put you in prison really?

2225
01:47:13,060 --> 01:47:13,950
Or the brick,
you know,

2226
01:47:14,030 --> 01:47:16,460
like a lot of guys.
How long they put you in for until you

2227
01:47:16,740 --> 01:47:20,520
get in new guys.
I think it was like 90 days restricts

2228
01:47:20,521 --> 01:47:21,354
it.
Yeah.

2229
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:23,970
And then they don't know.
I'll have to shoot you when he get out.

2230
01:47:23,971 --> 01:47:24,720
No,
no,

2231
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:25,501
no.
It's not like that.

2232
01:47:25,501 --> 01:47:26,400
It's just a,
it's one of those.

2233
01:47:26,460 --> 01:47:28,290
But I mean it was obviously about making
money.

2234
01:47:28,500 --> 01:47:30,550
Fuck or no,
because I'm an anthro sale.

2235
01:47:30,551 --> 01:47:33,240
Okay.
So you get hit with weaponized anthrax

2236
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:35,760
or you've even if you've been
vaccinated,

2237
01:47:35,890 --> 01:47:38,460
it's a spore.
It's a virus.

2238
01:47:38,610 --> 01:47:40,440
It's going to mutate as soon as it hits
the air.

2239
01:47:41,100 --> 01:47:41,980
So,
you know,

2240
01:47:42,210 --> 01:47:45,720
I guess the argument of the reasoning
was that it might make you live 30 or 40

2241
01:47:45,721 --> 01:47:49,320
extra seconds longer so you can hit the
button to launch some more missiles at

2242
01:47:49,321 --> 01:47:50,610
them.
I don't know what the reasoning behind

2243
01:47:50,611 --> 01:47:52,010
it was,
but uh,

2244
01:47:52,440 --> 01:47:54,390
yeah,
a lot of it was a big deal.

2245
01:47:54,391 --> 01:47:58,200
I remember when that story came out,
they found out that the admiral owned

2246
01:47:58,201 --> 01:48:00,660
the company was like,
wait a what?

2247
01:48:01,310 --> 01:48:02,730
So crazy.
This is illegal.

2248
01:48:03,070 --> 01:48:05,850
It's so crazy.
I wonder if he took the shot,

2249
01:48:06,270 --> 01:48:08,330
I doubt it.
Wide

2250
01:48:08,600 --> 01:48:13,520
Gulf War Syndrome was uh,
connected to depleted uranium.

2251
01:48:14,330 --> 01:48:16,910
Maybe it was a several,
several different factors,

2252
01:48:16,950 --> 01:48:20,720
so
many different factors because they know

2253
01:48:20,721 --> 01:48:25,721
that they definitely used depleted
uranium shells as anti tank weapons

2254
01:48:26,180 --> 01:48:28,910
that's been proven and that was
something that they were never supposed

2255
01:48:28,911 --> 01:48:31,010
to use.
And the half life on that shit is

2256
01:48:31,011 --> 01:48:33,170
something like 100,000 years or
something nutty.

2257
01:48:33,410 --> 01:48:38,410
So there's these places in Iraq to this
day that are just Foxville from these,

2258
01:48:39,650 --> 01:48:44,510
these depleted uranium shells slamming
into tanks and soldiers would take

2259
01:48:44,511 --> 01:48:47,160
pieces from those tanks as memories,
you know,

2260
01:48:47,190 --> 01:48:51,620
they take them home as souvenirs and so
you're carrying something that's highly

2261
01:48:51,621 --> 01:48:55,220
radioactive,
like those depleted uranium shells.

2262
01:48:55,221 --> 01:49:00,221
It's laid literally nuclear waste and
they use that as a shell and it just

2263
01:49:00,471 --> 01:49:04,790
goes through everything.
I mean,

2264
01:49:04,791 --> 01:49:09,080
you're harnessing the power of the sun,
the blow a hole through a jeep.

2265
01:49:09,620 --> 01:49:11,420
And then these poor fuckers,
you know,

2266
01:49:11,421 --> 01:49:13,580
they,
they stumble upon this jeep and nobody

2267
01:49:13,581 --> 01:49:15,770
had told them shit and they're like,
hey man,

2268
01:49:15,780 --> 01:49:20,000
I take this license plate home.
You shouldn't even be anywhere near

2269
01:49:20,001 --> 01:49:21,890
that.
You shouldn't even be a mile away from

2270
01:49:21,891 --> 01:49:23,780
that fucking jeep.
Meanwhile,

2271
01:49:23,781 --> 01:49:25,310
they're hanging around that God damn
thing.

2272
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:27,233
Who knows,
man,

2273
01:49:27,240 --> 01:49:32,240
my grandfather was in the South Pacific
during World War Two and even as an

2274
01:49:33,301 --> 01:49:35,520
older man,
he must have gotten something in his

2275
01:49:35,521 --> 01:49:39,000
blood over there because it'd be like
middle of July and he'd be sitting in

2276
01:49:39,001 --> 01:49:42,260
the house with like long johns and
corduroy pants and a flannel shirt on

2277
01:49:42,261 --> 01:49:43,520
and talk about I'm cold,
you know,

2278
01:49:43,680 --> 01:49:45,960
she's just like.
So I mean,

2279
01:49:45,961 --> 01:49:48,010
there must have been cemented as nerve
gas

2280
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:49,020
or.
Well,

2281
01:49:49,030 --> 01:49:52,740
maybe even just tropical diseases.
I talked to this,

2282
01:49:53,070 --> 01:49:54,430
this um,
guy.

2283
01:49:54,431 --> 01:49:55,400
He's a,
um,

2284
01:49:55,770 --> 01:49:58,180
uh,
an expert infectious diseases.

2285
01:49:58,570 --> 01:50:01,390
His name is Peter Hotez.
He's a,

2286
01:50:01,410 --> 01:50:04,990
um,
professor I think at the University of

2287
01:50:04,990 --> 01:50:05,823
Houston.
Um,

2288
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:11,100
but he's a specializes in diseases that
people get in tropical climates.

2289
01:50:11,830 --> 01:50:15,040
And he told me that when you look at a
tropical environment,

2290
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:19,690
100 percent of those people are infected
with some sort of parasite,

2291
01:50:20,450 --> 01:50:23,750
$100 silver built a resistance to it.
Well,

2292
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:25,210
they just,
they or not,

2293
01:50:25,750 --> 01:50:29,770
or they're affected by it.
Like we were talking about all sorts of

2294
01:50:29,771 --> 01:50:34,600
different moisture born bacterial
diseases that people get from dirty

2295
01:50:34,601 --> 01:50:39,601
water and stuff that you just get from
bugs and you get from the air and

2296
01:50:39,960 --> 01:50:42,060
jungleman.
You're basically living in a petri dish.

2297
01:50:42,061 --> 01:50:44,860
Yup.
You live in a nice shit's coming to life

2298
01:50:44,861 --> 01:50:47,260
every day.
I mean,

2299
01:50:47,261 --> 01:50:49,030
if you think about the jungle,
right?

2300
01:50:49,030 --> 01:50:52,750
If you go there and you see all that
vegetation ever around you,

2301
01:50:52,751 --> 01:50:57,751
it's just a life and crickets and bugs
and snakes and spiders and cats at

2302
01:50:57,951 --> 01:51:01,570
fucking sloths and eagles and real
monkeys and shed.

2303
01:51:01,571 --> 01:51:04,570
Whoa.
Like there's so much life there that

2304
01:51:04,571 --> 01:51:07,960
it's at a macro level too.
It's at a micro level,

2305
01:51:08,050 --> 01:51:09,880
like there's life that you're not going
to see.

2306
01:51:10,120 --> 01:51:13,120
It's going to get into your body,
crawling up your asshole right now while

2307
01:51:13,121 --> 01:51:16,690
you're swimming or you know,
eat becomes a part of you.

2308
01:51:17,400 --> 01:51:19,750
Like they,
they have these parasites that become a

2309
01:51:19,751 --> 01:51:24,220
part of you.
A buddy of mine got tricky gnosis foul

2310
01:51:24,280 --> 01:51:25,290
dude.
Jesus.

2311
01:51:25,780 --> 01:51:29,170
He got tricky gnosis from eating a bear
meat that wasn't cooked that well.

2312
01:51:29,171 --> 01:51:30,990
Actually it was on the show.
His name is Steven.

2313
01:51:30,991 --> 01:51:34,300
Ellie's a hosted the show called
mediator and he was on the show with a

2314
01:51:34,301 --> 01:51:35,260
bunch of other crew members.

2315
01:51:35,260 --> 01:51:38,080
They all eat this bear and they all
didn't cook it.

2316
01:51:38,081 --> 01:51:39,910
Well,
they didn't cook it well enough and they

2317
01:51:39,911 --> 01:51:42,070
were joking about getting trick and
hostess at the time.

2318
01:51:42,071 --> 01:51:46,060
So they all got trick analysis so they
have these little tiny worms,

2319
01:51:46,120 --> 01:51:49,360
these larva that are in their body
forever growing.

2320
01:51:49,720 --> 01:51:50,553
Well,
they don't grow.

2321
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:53,680
They just stayed dormant in your body
until someone comes along and say if you

2322
01:51:53,681 --> 01:51:56,920
ate Steven Rinella and you didn't cook
them to 160 degrees,

2323
01:51:57,340 --> 01:52:01,270
you would get tricky gnosis from them.
Like it's in him for just.

2324
01:52:01,900 --> 01:52:03,370
Yeah,
just part of the deal.

2325
01:52:05,250 --> 01:52:08,320
And he said he was like really deathly
sick for like seven days.

2326
01:52:08,350 --> 01:52:11,230
Felt like shit.
Like you had the flu in pain all the

2327
01:52:11,231 --> 01:52:14,500
time is aching and pain and then it went
away and then it just.

2328
01:52:14,501 --> 01:52:16,720
You just deal with the fact that now you
have a trick analysis.

2329
01:52:18,010 --> 01:52:22,450
But like in these tropical environments,
there's tons of people that have all

2330
01:52:22,451 --> 01:52:27,451
sorts of crazy parasites in their body,
dysentery or malaria or any damn yeah.

2331
01:52:28,570 --> 01:52:31,210
And in some parasites,
they're just starting to now understand

2332
01:52:31,480 --> 01:52:34,390
this parasites that affect behavior.
Like there's some shit called

2333
01:52:34,391 --> 01:52:36,880
toxoplasmosis.
You heard of that one.

2334
01:52:36,910 --> 01:52:40,960
The cat parents plasmosis get you
fucking die from smelling bird shit,

2335
01:52:42,460 --> 01:52:44,680
dude.
One of the creepiest stories I've ever

2336
01:52:44,681 --> 01:52:47,600
heard was guys in Africa,
they were standing in front of a cave

2337
01:52:48,050 --> 01:52:50,990
thing was Africa and they were standing
in front of a cave and there were

2338
01:52:50,991 --> 01:52:54,770
scientists and they wanted to photograph
these birds fly.

2339
01:52:54,771 --> 01:52:57,650
Are these bats rather flying out of the
cave when they would go out at night

2340
01:52:57,651 --> 01:53:02,150
because you know the bats leave caves
and mass and there was millions of bats,

2341
01:53:02,151 --> 01:53:05,900
literally millions of bats in this cave.
And so they parked out in front of this

2342
01:53:05,901 --> 01:53:09,770
cave,
set up the calls and shit to shit on.

2343
01:53:09,920 --> 01:53:13,970
That's what they didn't anticipate.
All the flying out of the shit on.

2344
01:53:14,030 --> 01:53:16,790
And they got deathly ill and they were
dead within weeks.

2345
01:53:17,480 --> 01:53:19,120
Both guys died.
They died.

2346
01:53:19,130 --> 01:53:22,880
This whole thing on tv about the dive
viruses,

2347
01:53:23,060 --> 01:53:25,520
which means they start bleeding on their
fucking eyeballs.

2348
01:53:27,960 --> 01:53:30,260
That's what you get for going and
looking at in bat caves,

2349
01:53:30,261 --> 01:53:31,240
man.
Well,

2350
01:53:31,300 --> 01:53:34,330
bring raincoats on some goggles.
Yeah,

2351
01:53:34,331 --> 01:53:35,860
man.
You gotta don't eat it.

2352
01:53:35,980 --> 01:53:39,370
Definitely don't eat it,
but it gets in your skin like you can't

2353
01:53:39,400 --> 01:53:43,030
have that shit on your skin.
You can get sick just from it contacting

2354
01:53:43,031 --> 01:53:46,960
your face a bat dirty bat shit.
Shit's on your face.

2355
01:53:47,350 --> 01:53:50,320
You could probably die.
I'd want to.

2356
01:53:50,380 --> 01:53:55,360
Yeah.
Oh Man.

2357
01:53:55,660 --> 01:53:59,230
There's so many parts of the world where
there's so much life and that life is so

2358
01:53:59,231 --> 01:54:02,770
much more dangerous.
We're just so used to life being like,

2359
01:54:02,800 --> 01:54:04,960
oh look at the squirrel.
I love wildlife.

2360
01:54:05,290 --> 01:54:06,790
Look at that bird.
So cute.

2361
01:54:07,470 --> 01:54:11,520
But you always hear about these people
like talking about going down to Ecuador

2362
01:54:11,521 --> 01:54:14,100
and Peru to do.
I asked him like,

2363
01:54:14,130 --> 01:54:15,990
fuck that.
I don't want to go through that damn

2364
01:54:15,991 --> 01:54:18,960
jungle with those bugs and caterpillars
and shit.

2365
01:54:19,230 --> 01:54:22,620
Snakes crawling up my leg.
They say that's part of the experience

2366
01:54:22,621 --> 01:54:24,300
is going to the jungle,
but yeah,

2367
01:54:24,301 --> 01:54:27,130
you could do that in Malibu.
You can do it in Malburg,

2368
01:54:27,150 --> 01:54:30,240
man.
You can just sit down in the house.

2369
01:54:30,330 --> 01:54:34,950
I'll do the cliff notes.
The cliff notes is DMT,

2370
01:54:38,370 --> 01:54:40,950
man.
I think going to the jungle probably be

2371
01:54:40,951 --> 01:54:45,951
pretty bad ass.
But you have running around.

2372
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:47,460
Yeah.
Yeah.

2373
01:54:47,460 --> 01:54:50,280
You have to have people that are awake
with spotlights and guns.

2374
01:54:51,030 --> 01:54:52,710
Yeah.
You don't want to be that one dude that

2375
01:54:52,711 --> 01:54:55,200
goes to South American.
It's jacked by a leopard will just sleep

2376
01:54:55,201 --> 01:54:56,430
in this tree.
Jaguar.

2377
01:54:56,510 --> 01:54:57,720
But Jaguar,
Jaguar,

2378
01:54:58,350 --> 01:54:59,220
Jaguar,
South America,

2379
01:54:59,221 --> 01:54:59,400
right.

2380
01:54:59,400 --> 01:55:00,030
Leopards.
Uh,

2381
01:55:00,030 --> 01:55:01,140
Africa,
Asia.

2382
01:55:01,230 --> 01:55:03,270
That sounds right.
So yeah,

2383
01:55:03,271 --> 01:55:06,060
man,
this has been a national geographic

2384
01:55:06,120 --> 01:55:08,210
podcasts.
They oftentimes are.

2385
01:55:08,230 --> 01:55:11,760
You knew a guy named Steve Mirrors.
Mirrors Huy spelled last name.

2386
01:55:11,970 --> 01:55:14,150
He's a British guy.
He's like a naturalist in those.

2387
01:55:14,500 --> 01:55:16,940
He's like A.
Probably a master survival is put a,

2388
01:55:18,250 --> 01:55:20,090
I think it's Mirror Steve.
Look it up,

2389
01:55:20,100 --> 01:55:21,150
Steven Mirrors,
man.

2390
01:55:21,210 --> 01:55:22,800
You should try to get him on the show
sometimes.

2391
01:55:22,830 --> 01:55:25,800
I used to,
I used to sit and just watch hours of

2392
01:55:25,801 --> 01:55:27,200
youtube videos.
He's like one of these.

2393
01:55:27,240 --> 01:55:29,160
You just tell her just like a beautiful
human being,

2394
01:55:29,570 --> 01:55:31,010
but he knows all about,
um,

2395
01:55:32,250 --> 01:55:36,360
it's like bear grylls and Mr Rogers,
you know what I mean?

2396
01:55:37,140 --> 01:55:39,750
But bind together,
but a little more legit.

2397
01:55:40,190 --> 01:55:42,060
Real bear grylls.
Yeah.

2398
01:55:42,510 --> 01:55:43,800
Bear grylls.
Legit.

2399
01:55:43,890 --> 01:55:44,420
Oh,

2400
01:55:44,420 --> 01:55:46,860
girls got compromised by Hollywood.
Hollywood.

2401
01:55:47,010 --> 01:55:48,870
Do you know why bear grylls got that
show?

2402
01:55:49,400 --> 01:55:51,850
I have no idea.
Some inflammation drinking is piss.

2403
01:55:51,860 --> 01:55:53,490
Nope.
Les Stroud,

2404
01:55:53,600 --> 01:55:56,340
survivor man did not want to fake
anything.

2405
01:55:56,820 --> 01:55:58,800
Less.
Drought did all his own shit.

2406
01:55:58,830 --> 01:56:01,680
He went by himself.
He put himself in dangerous situations.

2407
01:56:01,681 --> 01:56:05,250
He lost tons of weight on camera,
whereas literally starving to death,

2408
01:56:05,460 --> 01:56:09,120
he documented the entire thing in 100
percent by himself.

2409
01:56:09,240 --> 01:56:12,810
Encounters with wild animals,
like really dangerous situations.

2410
01:56:13,210 --> 01:56:15,420
Almost starving to death,
almost freezing to death,

2411
01:56:15,421 --> 01:56:19,050
having to make fire on your own and
going there with a very limited amount

2412
01:56:19,051 --> 01:56:21,060
of things to keep.
Like you would go there with like a

2413
01:56:21,061 --> 01:56:23,040
pocket knife.
You'll allow themselves some string that

2414
01:56:23,041 --> 01:56:26,640
he could go fishing with go and he would
stay for seven days and have a dropoff

2415
01:56:26,641 --> 01:56:30,090
point where they would drop them off and
then it pick up point and if he didn't

2416
01:56:30,091 --> 01:56:32,130
go to the pickup point and they didn't
have to go looking for them,

2417
01:56:32,550 --> 01:56:37,550
but they wanted to fake stuff and bear
bear grylls filled that gap because les

2418
01:56:38,221 --> 01:56:39,054
whitten fake anything.

2419
01:56:39,270 --> 01:56:39,781
It's like,
no,

2420
01:56:39,781 --> 01:56:43,650
we not bringing a camera crew because
then it's not me by myself that you lose

2421
01:56:43,651 --> 01:56:48,270
all of what makes the show special.
So what he did is just a bunch of things

2422
01:56:48,271 --> 01:56:51,930
that they set up.
Like if I found these sheep,

2423
01:56:52,070 --> 01:56:54,420
I could take it and make a coat.
You know,

2424
01:56:54,421 --> 01:56:56,550
like the shit they put the sheep there,
they killed the sheep,

2425
01:56:56,880 --> 01:57:00,750
they did it for them.
I keep doing all these stunts,

2426
01:57:00,751 --> 01:57:04,840
like jumping from tree to tree and
unnecessarily hanging out with hippo is

2427
01:57:04,950 --> 01:57:08,280
this guy.
No Steve Black Shawl.

2428
01:57:08,281 --> 01:57:13,281
I can't find a Steve Bowles's last name.
Ray mears premier's just guys hanging

2429
01:57:14,881 --> 01:57:19,200
out with hippos because that guy's
saying ray mears,

2430
01:57:19,730 --> 01:57:22,890
gangs for.
There's a show called Carter's war and

2431
01:57:22,900 --> 01:57:27,900
it's this show about this guy who is an
anti anti poaching official in Africa

2432
01:57:31,620 --> 01:57:35,190
and he tries to prevent them from
poaching all these animals.

2433
01:57:35,310 --> 01:57:40,310
A lot of it is for the Asian market,
for Rhino Horn and a bunch of these

2434
01:57:40,801 --> 01:57:45,450
different animals that they want like
ivory and Rhino Horn is a big one

2435
01:57:45,451 --> 01:57:47,430
though.
They keep finding these rhinos murdered

2436
01:57:47,431 --> 01:57:48,720
with their horns,
hacked off.

2437
01:57:49,290 --> 01:57:51,360
It's a fucking sobering show,
man,

2438
01:57:51,570 --> 01:57:52,590
for two reasons.
One,

2439
01:57:52,591 --> 01:57:54,720
because you see what people are willing
to do.

2440
01:57:54,721 --> 01:57:57,750
These animals just shoot them in the
head and cut their horns off and cut

2441
01:57:57,930 --> 01:58:00,050
half their face off like a chainsaw and
shit.

2442
01:58:00,060 --> 01:58:04,230
It's crazy.
And then also you see how fucking poor

2443
01:58:04,231 --> 01:58:08,310
these people are and then you realize
like they of course they're going to do

2444
01:58:08,311 --> 01:58:10,560
that.
Like if they can shoot that rhino and

2445
01:58:10,561 --> 01:58:14,790
make $50,000 from its magic corn or
whatever the fuck they make,

2446
01:58:14,820 --> 01:58:16,760
they probably make 50 bucks,
you know?

2447
01:58:17,010 --> 01:58:20,280
But if they can make that,
it's between them starving and not

2448
01:58:20,281 --> 01:58:22,200
starving.
Like that's literally what you're

2449
01:58:22,201 --> 01:58:26,910
looking at.
Everything subjective.

2450
01:58:27,030 --> 01:58:30,300
Just the gentlemen that's him shows
called Bushcraft,

2451
01:58:30,320 --> 01:58:32,820
those crafts hanging out with a wolf.
Look at this motherfucker.

2452
01:58:33,210 --> 01:58:35,200
He knows the wolves.
He's like,

2453
01:58:35,250 --> 01:58:38,400
he's like the most unassuming guy,
but he's so bad ass dude.

2454
01:58:38,550 --> 01:58:40,530
It's called bushcraft.
Bushcraft.

2455
01:58:40,590 --> 01:58:41,890
Is it an English show or an

2456
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:45,430
Australia on the BBC I believe.
Oh Man.

2457
01:58:46,670 --> 01:58:47,503
Yeah.

2458
01:58:48,060 --> 01:58:50,100
Doodle.
Just walk out in the woods with nothing

2459
01:58:50,101 --> 01:58:53,440
but a damn or there.
Is there a fish

2460
01:58:56,340 --> 01:58:59,060
with like some piece of meat or
something they got.

2461
01:58:59,490 --> 01:59:02,520
Yeah.
These guys that are into like surviving

2462
01:59:02,521 --> 01:59:05,160
on their own like that.
They take great pleasure with that.

2463
01:59:05,161 --> 01:59:08,590
They're always fascinating.
I guess he's really naturalist to like

2464
01:59:08,640 --> 01:59:12,810
Fanta and natural vegetation and finding
forging food on your own that contains a

2465
01:59:12,811 --> 01:59:15,210
lot more useful information than just,
okay,

2466
01:59:15,960 --> 01:59:19,470
you got three days,
drink your pis and don't get eaten by

2467
01:59:19,471 --> 01:59:22,640
the alligator.
Like no man will.

2468
01:59:22,650 --> 01:59:25,350
Survivor man came up,
came up with all that on his own.

2469
01:59:25,620 --> 01:59:28,920
His concept,
because he was actually living in the

2470
01:59:28,921 --> 01:59:33,270
forest with his pregnant wife.
The two of them,

2471
01:59:33,290 --> 01:59:36,270
they are by themselves.
When he was a younger man,

2472
01:59:36,271 --> 01:59:38,730
like he did this on his own before,
you know,

2473
01:59:38,820 --> 01:59:41,400
before he was famous,
like he's been doing this forever.

2474
01:59:41,550 --> 01:59:43,290
What's his background?
Where do you learn it all?

2475
01:59:43,460 --> 01:59:44,281
He just,
I don't know,

2476
01:59:44,281 --> 01:59:44,460
man.

2477
01:59:44,460 --> 01:59:46,170
That's a good question.
He told me I forgot.

2478
01:59:47,370 --> 01:59:52,370
I think he just learned to read a lot of
suffering for those 30 minutes of

2479
01:59:53,401 --> 01:59:56,970
viewing entertainment.
He's got this wacky thing he's doing now

2480
01:59:56,971 --> 02:00:00,200
and always looking for bigfoot.
He's got a survivor man.

2481
02:00:00,230 --> 02:00:02,250
Big Foot is like the biggest thing since
sliced bread.

2482
02:00:02,310 --> 02:00:04,620
Leavenworth Washington.
That's where he is.

2483
02:00:05,410 --> 02:00:06,450
Do you see him?
Yeah,

2484
02:00:06,451 --> 02:00:08,660
so when we got a cup of coffee on the
road one day,

2485
02:00:08,680 --> 02:00:11,820
this lady had a whole photo album full
of pictures of bigfoot in her backyard.

2486
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:16,140
It looked like some bullshit,
like our neighbor jacket off.

2487
02:00:19,560 --> 02:00:24,560
She's selling coffee though.
I talked to One lady when I was doing

2488
02:00:25,261 --> 02:00:26,520
this,
a Scifi show.

2489
02:00:26,540 --> 02:00:30,810
We did a whole episode on bigfoot one
lady that I really believe saw something

2490
02:00:30,880 --> 02:00:34,500
a really believe she did,
but what I think she probably saw was a

2491
02:00:34,501 --> 02:00:37,530
black bear because black players walk on
their hind legs.

2492
02:00:37,780 --> 02:00:39,750
Um,
there's video of black bears walk in

2493
02:00:39,751 --> 02:00:43,920
like 100 yards from her.
She was very earnest and what she was

2494
02:00:43,921 --> 02:00:46,290
talking about and was sensational in
any,

2495
02:00:46,291 --> 02:00:47,970
in any way at all.
What she was telling me,

2496
02:00:47,971 --> 02:00:49,770
it was pretty,
pretty straightforward.

2497
02:00:49,950 --> 02:00:53,850
And I also believe her because there's
black bears in that area.

2498
02:00:54,630 --> 02:00:58,380
It's incredibly densely wooded.
Like the area that she's talking about

2499
02:00:58,381 --> 02:01:01,580
was the Pacific northwest.
Oh yeah man.

2500
02:01:02,280 --> 02:01:03,920
I guess Mount Rainier,
Mt.

2501
02:01:03,920 --> 02:01:05,040
Rainier.
That's right outside of Washington,

2502
02:01:05,410 --> 02:01:08,100
right outside of Seattle.
It's gorgeous.

2503
02:01:08,300 --> 02:01:12,060
Big Harry fucked her is real.
That's the only place he could possibly

2504
02:01:12,061 --> 02:01:15,270
exist because you could absolutely
disappeared in that forest.

2505
02:01:15,380 --> 02:01:16,740
Yup.
That's some dense,

2506
02:01:17,640 --> 02:01:22,640
dense wilderness and filled with food
filled with food filled with wildly

2507
02:01:23,660 --> 02:01:25,370
known me saying,
I believe in bigfoot.

2508
02:01:25,620 --> 02:01:27,790
Yeah.
You're,

2509
02:01:27,810 --> 02:01:30,930
you're 100 percent correct though.
If there was an animal like that,

2510
02:01:30,990 --> 02:01:34,230
that would be the spot.
It also would be the spot because that's

2511
02:01:34,231 --> 02:01:36,870
the spot where it would make sense
geographically.

2512
02:01:37,140 --> 02:01:40,010
My feeling is what I believe.
I bet

2513
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:43,430
it used to be real because at one point
in time there was a thing called

2514
02:01:43,431 --> 02:01:48,020
gigantic pithy kiss that lived in Asia.
It was as recently as 100,000 years ago,

2515
02:01:48,380 --> 02:01:52,070
which is not that long and that was when
the bering strait was connected,

2516
02:01:52,250 --> 02:01:56,900
so Asia and the United States,
you could actually walk from Asia to the

2517
02:01:56,900 --> 02:02:00,410
United States that the land mass was in
place and the ice age and was all frozen

2518
02:02:00,411 --> 02:02:02,720
over.
So during that time it would have been

2519
02:02:02,780 --> 02:02:07,580
entirely possible because so many native
American cultures have names for that

2520
02:02:07,581 --> 02:02:11,810
animal to have names for this.
Like man that lives in the forest is

2521
02:02:13,010 --> 02:02:17,450
how's the same legend on the other side
of the world about some crazy well,

2522
02:02:17,451 --> 02:02:19,080
and it was real.
Right?

2523
02:02:19,220 --> 02:02:22,100
And then also on top of that thing being
real.

2524
02:02:22,220 --> 02:02:25,520
They also know that there was those
little hobbit people in the island of

2525
02:02:25,521 --> 02:02:30,521
Flores and there's a theory about that
thing is that it's either the most

2526
02:02:30,831 --> 02:02:31,370
recent one.

2527
02:02:31,370 --> 02:02:35,750
They think that it might've been as
recently as 50,000 years ago,

2528
02:02:35,751 --> 02:02:39,200
but I think they thought it was like
14,000 years ago until recently.

2529
02:02:39,230 --> 02:02:41,300
Look at this.
That's a bear dude.

2530
02:02:41,570 --> 02:02:43,280
That is a bear.
Look at that.

2531
02:02:43,640 --> 02:02:48,640
That's a real legit black bear.
So imagine if you saw that for sure.

2532
02:02:48,891 --> 02:02:50,250
That's big fish.
So that last little.

2533
02:02:51,200 --> 02:02:55,400
See when bears hurt there Paul.
Like if they get bitten in there,

2534
02:02:55,401 --> 02:02:59,090
Paul and their pod gets infected.
They can walk on their back legs and

2535
02:02:59,091 --> 02:03:02,890
they can do it for hundreds of yards.
So I think she saw that just when you

2536
02:03:02,891 --> 02:03:06,160
thought they couldn't get any scarier.
There's a bunch of videos of bear's

2537
02:03:06,180 --> 02:03:08,360
doing that.
It's not just that one bear.

2538
02:03:08,390 --> 02:03:10,640
So there's a lot of evidence that bears
walk like that.

2539
02:03:10,970 --> 02:03:14,840
So this one lady that I talked to,
I bet she saw a black bear that was

2540
02:03:14,841 --> 02:03:15,560
walking on time.

2541
02:03:15,560 --> 02:03:16,281
Legs.
That's what.

2542
02:03:16,281 --> 02:03:17,900
I bet.
It only makes sense.

2543
02:03:18,890 --> 02:03:20,840
You can't see anything in there.
Anyway,

2544
02:03:21,170 --> 02:03:25,160
that's the thing about those woods.
You lived up there right in the car for

2545
02:03:25,161 --> 02:03:25,994
a minute.
Yeah.

2546
02:03:26,070 --> 02:03:28,190
You can't see shit in those woods.
No.

2547
02:03:28,250 --> 02:03:32,480
We used to go.
Just look a little weird Swiss mountain

2548
02:03:32,481 --> 02:03:34,640
ski town called Living Worth.
I don't know,

2549
02:03:34,641 --> 02:03:36,980
a buddy of mine.
We drove through on our way to Vancouver

2550
02:03:37,070 --> 02:03:39,980
to go party and there was another,
it was like farther east,

2551
02:03:39,981 --> 02:03:41,120
I think it was like,
you know,

2552
02:03:41,140 --> 02:03:42,920
in the middle of nothing man,
just trees.

2553
02:03:44,680 --> 02:03:47,360
You could,
you could just walk off into it and

2554
02:03:47,361 --> 02:03:49,670
disappear.
Well less.

2555
02:03:49,730 --> 02:03:53,170
When he was camping,
he was doing an episode of survivor and

2556
02:03:53,190 --> 02:03:58,190
it was up in Alaska and he says that he
heard some noise outside of his tent and

2557
02:04:01,671 --> 02:04:02,930
he barely moved.
Like he didn't,

2558
02:04:02,960 --> 02:04:05,420
he didn't want to move.
We wanted to see if he could get his

2559
02:04:05,421 --> 02:04:09,590
camera and uh,
try to record this and he heard

2560
02:04:09,591 --> 02:04:11,940
something that sounded like a primate,
something like

2561
02:04:13,510 --> 02:04:18,510
made like some primate type noise.
And then when he went to open up his

2562
02:04:18,801 --> 02:04:20,840
tent and look outside,
the thing took off,

2563
02:04:21,050 --> 02:04:23,660
took off running.
And he said it sounded like bipedal

2564
02:04:23,661 --> 02:04:25,250
footprints.
I go large,

2565
02:04:25,280 --> 02:04:26,690
heavy,
bipedal thing.

2566
02:04:27,320 --> 02:04:31,190
The problem is I've heard bears make
that kind of sound.

2567
02:04:31,250 --> 02:04:34,490
I've heard them personally,
seen them with my eyes fighting with

2568
02:04:34,491 --> 02:04:38,280
each other.
They they make like

2569
02:04:38,550 --> 02:04:43,550
a almost like a gorilla and they're
attacking each other and they were

2570
02:04:45,060 --> 02:04:48,840
making this crazy noise.
It was a mother trying to keep a male

2571
02:04:48,841 --> 02:04:51,380
bear away from her cubs.
And she was.

2572
02:04:51,450 --> 02:04:53,310
They fought.
They fought right in front of us,

2573
02:04:53,370 --> 02:04:56,520
like within a hundred yards.
I watched him duke it out,

2574
02:04:56,670 --> 02:05:00,770
UFC style Alberta.
I was watching it go down.

2575
02:05:01,740 --> 02:05:06,740
So I've heard bears make like a monkey
sound that makes much more practical

2576
02:05:06,751 --> 02:05:11,751
sense to me than a seven foot tall
chewbacca that no one's ever seemed to

2577
02:05:12,451 --> 02:05:14,670
be able to play.
Eyes are more hands on,

2578
02:05:14,860 --> 02:05:18,540
you know?
Well we got drones now,

2579
02:05:18,541 --> 02:05:20,310
man.
I wanted to believe so bad.

2580
02:05:20,970 --> 02:05:24,150
That's why the one thing I want to
believe in bigfoot almost as much as

2581
02:05:24,151 --> 02:05:29,040
aliens as Ufo reports,
aliens and Ufo is like the one that's

2582
02:05:29,041 --> 02:05:31,770
the one two punch for what you want to
believe in,

2583
02:05:33,900 --> 02:05:36,000
man.
Yeah.

2584
02:05:36,150 --> 02:05:38,770
Other than love.
Well that too.

2585
02:05:41,450 --> 02:05:43,500
I don't know.
We don't want to go down that rabbit

2586
02:05:43,501 --> 02:05:44,390
hole.
Yeah,

2587
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:47,580
black holes and infinite multi versus.
Well,

2588
02:05:47,581 --> 02:05:47,940
I,
I,

2589
02:05:47,940 --> 02:05:51,180
without a doubt,
you go to school out there that were

2590
02:05:51,181 --> 02:05:52,050
the.
Yeah.

2591
02:05:52,290 --> 02:05:54,660
I guess the question is why would they
fucking care?

2592
02:05:55,530 --> 02:05:57,450
Well,
or maybe they do.

2593
02:05:57,451 --> 02:05:59,040
I mean,
maybe this is pretty interesting.

2594
02:05:59,160 --> 02:06:01,170
I'd watch it for sure.
I mean,

2595
02:06:01,171 --> 02:06:01,561
come on,
man.

2596
02:06:01,561 --> 02:06:03,490
We studied turtles.
You know,

2597
02:06:03,720 --> 02:06:06,330
dudes traveled to the jungle to study of
fucking butterfly.

2598
02:06:06,690 --> 02:06:08,820
Some heavy stuff going on the back of a
turtle.

2599
02:06:08,821 --> 02:06:09,960
Joe Rogan.
That's true.

2600
02:06:10,260 --> 02:06:11,970
Not to demean turtles.
Look,

2601
02:06:11,971 --> 02:06:13,740
if turtles were on the moon,
oh my God,

2602
02:06:13,741 --> 02:06:17,520
we'd be flying jets to,
to visit the oldest known species on

2603
02:06:17,521 --> 02:06:19,530
earth day crocodiles.
Really?

2604
02:06:21,220 --> 02:06:22,670
Whoa.
Yeah.

2605
02:06:22,920 --> 02:06:25,920
Turtles been around longer than any
other living creature on the planet.

2606
02:06:26,660 --> 02:06:27,570
They're like,
um,

2607
02:06:27,750 --> 02:06:30,540
nail clippers.
They never had to make them any better.

2608
02:06:31,060 --> 02:06:32,400
That's perfect design.
Yeah.

2609
02:06:32,410 --> 02:06:34,590
Like when I was a kid,
nail clippers are exactly the same.

2610
02:06:35,190 --> 02:06:36,060
They haven't done anything.
I mean,

2611
02:06:36,061 --> 02:06:40,050
they made better can openers.
They've made a better tupperware.

2612
02:06:40,490 --> 02:06:45,490
They've improved almost every aspect.
I guess steak knives are pretty much the

2613
02:06:45,901 --> 02:06:48,720
same.
Even even the number of,

2614
02:06:48,721 --> 02:06:50,970
uh,
like the,

2615
02:06:51,170 --> 02:06:52,110
the,
the Shill,

2616
02:06:52,350 --> 02:06:52,891
you know,
the,

2617
02:06:52,891 --> 02:06:53,650
the,
you know,

2618
02:06:53,650 --> 02:06:55,560
like the symmetrical patterns of the
shoulders.

2619
02:06:55,561 --> 02:06:58,020
13,
no matter how big are they are small.

2620
02:06:58,680 --> 02:07:02,610
So like all Indians believe that that
coincided with the 13 lunar cycles of

2621
02:07:02,611 --> 02:07:04,490
the moon.
Yeah.

2622
02:07:04,920 --> 02:07:06,960
I made a whole album cover all about
this shit.

2623
02:07:06,961 --> 02:07:09,330
I was just letting you know,
the guys like how weird can we get with

2624
02:07:09,331 --> 02:07:14,331
this thing?
Just make the tackiest record cover ever

2625
02:07:14,700 --> 02:07:18,540
day are a very fascinating creature.
I mean anytime you see patterns like

2626
02:07:18,541 --> 02:07:21,270
even like a Nautilus Shell,
see these patterns,

2627
02:07:21,271 --> 02:07:24,060
these repeating patterns that the
animals have.

2628
02:07:24,840 --> 02:07:25,471
Like,
you know,

2629
02:07:25,471 --> 02:07:27,090
okay,
well why is there as some sort of a

2630
02:07:27,091 --> 02:07:29,640
geometric pattern into this animal's
design?

2631
02:07:30,800 --> 02:07:34,110
You know,
almost fractal.

2632
02:07:34,111 --> 02:07:34,691
Really?
Oh,

2633
02:07:34,691 --> 02:07:35,380
it is.
It's.

2634
02:07:35,380 --> 02:07:36,280
Well,
it's a FIBONACCI

2635
02:07:36,280 --> 02:07:39,430
sequence.
The FIBONACCI sequence manifests itself

2636
02:07:39,431 --> 02:07:41,950
in like sunflowers.
Like they say,

2637
02:07:41,951 --> 02:07:45,070
like if you look at a pine cone on the
FIBONACCI sequences in a pine cone,

2638
02:07:45,370 --> 02:07:48,520
meaning that it's a sequence of numbers
like zero.

2639
02:07:48,521 --> 02:07:52,210
And then there's one and then there's.
And then there's two and one plus two.

2640
02:07:52,490 --> 02:07:54,670
There's three and three plus two is
five,

2641
02:07:54,671 --> 02:07:59,200
and the five plus three is eight and it
keeps going on and on and on,

2642
02:07:59,590 --> 02:08:04,590
and it's this exponential equation and
when you're adding all those things up,

2643
02:08:06,160 --> 02:08:11,160
that same sequence can be found in the
shape of people's faces and honeycombs

2644
02:08:11,441 --> 02:08:14,230
and a bunch of different designs like
pine cones.

2645
02:08:14,231 --> 02:08:16,120
There's very.
See Jamie's got some stuff.

2646
02:08:16,121 --> 02:08:19,150
They pull up a bit.
The FIBONACCI numbers in nature.

2647
02:08:19,151 --> 02:08:21,700
There's this crazy green fruit that's
always at my,

2648
02:08:21,750 --> 02:08:23,440
uh,
might be a vegetable.

2649
02:08:23,441 --> 02:08:26,620
That's it.
What is that fucking thing that fruit?

2650
02:08:26,620 --> 02:08:28,120
Broccoli?
What does it.

2651
02:08:28,121 --> 02:08:30,310
Romanesque Broccoli,
romanesque Broccoli.

2652
02:08:30,400 --> 02:08:33,570
It's like the DMT fruit,
like when you look at that,

2653
02:08:33,571 --> 02:08:38,571
like that is fractal geometry in fruit
form or in vegetable form or other

2654
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:43,030
really weird.
But that's the FIBONACCI sequence.

2655
02:08:43,031 --> 02:08:47,310
Like if you go to the very top and you
see how small it is and then it as it

2656
02:08:47,500 --> 02:08:50,620
tapers down,
it gets larger and the numbers all

2657
02:08:50,621 --> 02:08:53,140
exponentially increased.
It's just so fascinating.

2658
02:08:53,380 --> 02:08:54,640
Tool.
Yeah.

2659
02:08:55,630 --> 02:09:00,280
Was of a music.
The band when I was younger,

2660
02:09:00,820 --> 02:09:01,480
do you know that?
Uh,

2661
02:09:01,480 --> 02:09:04,450
maynard key is going to fight Ronda
Rousey and an MMA match.

2662
02:09:05,670 --> 02:09:07,020
Did Not know that.
Knew He.

2663
02:09:07,210 --> 02:09:08,910
When he loses,
he's getting an exchange.

2664
02:09:11,500 --> 02:09:12,700
You're bullshitting me.
Of course.

2665
02:09:12,701 --> 02:09:14,650
I am trying to help spread a rumor.
Awesome.

2666
02:09:15,250 --> 02:09:16,840
I'll show you some pictures afterwards.
He does.

2667
02:09:17,050 --> 02:09:20,020
Is he like a Jujitsu Guy?
I believe he's got his purple belt.

2668
02:09:20,050 --> 02:09:22,480
I'm pretty sure he goes about,
but he's very dedicated.

2669
02:09:22,630 --> 02:09:24,940
He's so dedicated.
You got a hip replacement and went back

2670
02:09:24,941 --> 02:09:28,270
to training.
But here it goes.

2671
02:09:28,840 --> 02:09:33,840
Five Rhonda Rogers Kit that look at it.
Awesome.

2672
02:09:34,690 --> 02:09:35,523
He's a fucking

2673
02:09:35,580 --> 02:09:36,840
character.
I love that dude.

2674
02:09:37,090 --> 02:09:38,240
Ever him?
Oh yeah.

2675
02:09:38,250 --> 02:09:39,540
Hung out with them.
Really cool.

2676
02:09:39,550 --> 02:09:41,610
He's been on the show a couple times.
He's a good dude.

2677
02:09:42,570 --> 02:09:44,240
Was one of my lyricist,
man.

2678
02:09:44,310 --> 02:09:45,143
Yeah,
a really.

2679
02:09:45,570 --> 02:09:48,390
When I lived out there and he was a
little kinds of music I just discovered

2680
02:09:48,391 --> 02:09:50,040
that I probably never would have gotten
into otherwise.

2681
02:09:50,041 --> 02:09:54,900
And that band I really like had a little
phase lyrically speaking.

2682
02:09:54,901 --> 02:09:58,650
I thought it was some of the more
Cathartic and kind of start donek stuff

2683
02:09:58,651 --> 02:10:02,990
I've ever heard.
Really intelligent way of saying things.

2684
02:10:03,010 --> 02:10:04,110
I just never metal guy,

2685
02:10:04,370 --> 02:10:09,370
he's almost too smart for his own good.
He's one of those guys when he talked to

2686
02:10:09,801 --> 02:10:10,591
me like this,
you,

2687
02:10:10,591 --> 02:10:13,220
you might be just in your own way all
the time.

2688
02:10:13,640 --> 02:10:18,640
So it's one of the reasons why thank.
He decided to start a wine business out

2689
02:10:18,651 --> 02:10:22,340
of in the middle of nowhere just.
And his wine is fucking excellent.

2690
02:10:22,370 --> 02:10:24,830
I don't know if you're a wine person if
you like wine,

2691
02:10:24,831 --> 02:10:28,160
but caduceus wine.
I just know what I like and I love it.

2692
02:10:28,280 --> 02:10:30,140
It's great.
He has a bunch of different kinds of

2693
02:10:30,141 --> 02:10:31,790
ones,
but uh,

2694
02:10:31,850 --> 02:10:35,150
he's,
he's a legit wizard when it comes to

2695
02:10:35,151 --> 02:10:38,420
winemaking.
He really knows his shit inside and out.

2696
02:10:38,421 --> 02:10:40,130
It's not like some sort of a thing that
he leaned,

2697
02:10:40,430 --> 02:10:42,340
lends his name to,
you know,

2698
02:10:42,350 --> 02:10:46,310
like fucking orson wells.
We will sell no wine before it's time.

2699
02:10:46,330 --> 02:10:46,620
No,
he,

2700
02:10:46,620 --> 02:10:51,230
this is his wine company,
like he has created it and he's also

2701
02:10:51,231 --> 02:10:54,380
like figured out a way to cultivate
grapes and it's very weird spot in

2702
02:10:54,381 --> 02:10:55,640
Arizona.
Well,

2703
02:10:55,641 --> 02:10:57,320
I don't think anybody was doing it
before him,

2704
02:10:57,321 --> 02:10:59,060
so he had to start the thing from
scratch.

2705
02:10:59,240 --> 02:11:03,290
He did the whole thing for years.
Doing it for years.

2706
02:11:03,470 --> 02:11:04,460
He's nuts,
man.

2707
02:11:04,760 --> 02:11:06,740
We've had some long ass conversations
about it.

2708
02:11:08,920 --> 02:11:10,570
Yeah,
he's one of the coolest people that I

2709
02:11:10,571 --> 02:11:11,590
talked to at the time.

2710
02:11:11,630 --> 02:11:12,530
That's Ballsy,
man,

2711
02:11:12,531 --> 02:11:14,720
because you don't.
I might be wrong,

2712
02:11:14,721 --> 02:11:19,721
but I think you have to bring in a
couple harvest and then you won't even

2713
02:11:20,571 --> 02:11:22,220
know if the grapes are going to be any
good.

2714
02:11:22,490 --> 02:11:24,860
That's a good spot for it.
So you're putting all this money up.

2715
02:11:24,940 --> 02:11:27,190
Well,
you have to analyze the soil and you

2716
02:11:27,191 --> 02:11:31,130
have to know what you're doing as far as
fertilizing it and all those all.

2717
02:11:31,240 --> 02:11:33,370
There's so many factors involved and how
to.

2718
02:11:33,670 --> 02:11:37,840
I mean it's an art.
It's a crazy art that you'd wind up

2719
02:11:37,870 --> 02:11:40,210
eating.
You wind up drinking at the very end of

2720
02:11:40,211 --> 02:11:42,430
it,
but creating the taste.

2721
02:11:42,640 --> 02:11:46,270
It's like the expression of the art
instead of an audible thing,

2722
02:11:46,540 --> 02:11:49,420
like a song.
It becomes a palette thing,

2723
02:11:49,690 --> 02:11:52,930
but it's a very much like the way he
creates music.

2724
02:11:52,990 --> 02:11:56,380
He creates this wine and it's a form of
art.

2725
02:11:56,920 --> 02:11:58,900
It's like a mass produce,
not mass produced,

2726
02:11:58,901 --> 02:12:00,130
you know,
like Coca Cola,

2727
02:12:00,131 --> 02:12:04,360
but it's making more than one bottle.
He's got several acres and he creates

2728
02:12:04,361 --> 02:12:07,810
this art and you experienced that art
instead of listening to a CD.

2729
02:12:08,120 --> 02:12:11,980
Experiencing that art when you drink is
one very fascinating guy,

2730
02:12:11,981 --> 02:12:12,510
man.

2731
02:12:12,510 --> 02:12:14,220
They just played in Nashville not long
ago.

2732
02:12:14,221 --> 02:12:15,970
It was on tour or I probably would have
gone,

2733
02:12:16,640 --> 02:12:20,120
but yeah,
I'd say top five shows of all time.

2734
02:12:20,140 --> 02:12:22,650
Wildlife tools.
Probably at least two of those spots.

2735
02:12:22,710 --> 02:12:23,401
Really?
Yeah,

2736
02:12:23,401 --> 02:12:24,350
Dude.
Wow.

2737
02:12:24,930 --> 02:12:25,381
Yeah,
a lot.

2738
02:12:25,381 --> 02:12:28,920
I mean it's just,
they're so incredibly tight glove just

2739
02:12:28,921 --> 02:12:31,010
aesthetically in the presentation and
it's sent,

2740
02:12:31,020 --> 02:12:31,831
you know,
most like big,

2741
02:12:31,831 --> 02:12:33,180
loud metal shows.
It's just as well.

2742
02:12:33,900 --> 02:12:34,581
Right,
right.

2743
02:12:34,581 --> 02:12:35,990
It was,
it was pristine,

2744
02:12:36,110 --> 02:12:39,980
like sound wise and the drummers of
machine.

2745
02:12:40,130 --> 02:12:41,550
Yeah.
Dana Carey.

2746
02:12:41,730 --> 02:12:44,320
I wouldn't put them in a metal category.
Maybe I'd be,

2747
02:12:44,740 --> 02:12:45,540
I don't know

2748
02:12:45,540 --> 02:12:47,250
what you'd call it.
It's,

2749
02:12:47,320 --> 02:12:50,270
it was so unique.
I don't remember hearing it even.

2750
02:12:51,020 --> 02:12:54,780
I'm thinking that's very,
uh,

2751
02:12:54,860 --> 02:12:56,900
some complex shit going on,
man.

2752
02:12:58,010 --> 02:12:59,420
Yeah.
We're talking about like motivating

2753
02:12:59,421 --> 02:13:01,970
songs that,
that riff in that song.

2754
02:13:01,971 --> 02:13:03,560
Prison sex.
No,

2755
02:13:03,610 --> 02:13:04,980
the beginning down,
down,

2756
02:13:05,730 --> 02:13:07,520
down,
down,

2757
02:13:08,970 --> 02:13:10,940
down.
When you're lifting weights and that

2758
02:13:10,941 --> 02:13:12,350
comes on,
you can lift more weights,

2759
02:13:12,351 --> 02:13:14,000
man.
You can lift more weights.

2760
02:13:14,390 --> 02:13:17,390
You feel stronger.
You like if you're tired,

2761
02:13:17,540 --> 02:13:21,560
you don't on the elliptical machine that
comes on you like you could fucking push

2762
02:13:21,561 --> 02:13:23,690
through.
I mean it does something to your body.

2763
02:13:24,110 --> 02:13:27,200
It energizes you.
Like that's a real feeling that you get.

2764
02:13:27,980 --> 02:13:30,850
We don't think of it as a real feeling
because he can't put it on a scale for

2765
02:13:30,860 --> 02:13:34,020
visceral music.
Something's happening to you when you

2766
02:13:34,021 --> 02:13:34,990
listened to a jam.
That's

2767
02:13:35,210 --> 02:13:35,660
correct.
Oh,

2768
02:13:35,660 --> 02:13:36,111
I mean,
I,

2769
02:13:36,111 --> 02:13:36,561
I,
you know,

2770
02:13:36,561 --> 02:13:39,080
you hate to think about though,
and those guys actually experimented

2771
02:13:39,081 --> 02:13:44,081
with frequencies and a lot of those deep
down pitch tunings and time signatures

2772
02:13:45,441 --> 02:13:46,510
are varies.
Very,

2773
02:13:46,520 --> 02:13:50,140
very,
very eastern melodion time signatures

2774
02:13:50,150 --> 02:13:52,850
that they're alternating in the,
off down.

2775
02:13:52,900 --> 02:13:54,420
It's,
it's heavy shit,

2776
02:13:54,900 --> 02:13:55,671
heavy,
heavy,

2777
02:13:55,671 --> 02:13:58,160
like they put thought into that music.
Well,

2778
02:13:58,161 --> 02:13:59,960
the one song that they orchestrated to
that,

2779
02:13:59,961 --> 02:14:04,040
you can totally manipulate human
emotions with tones and keys and

2780
02:14:04,041 --> 02:14:06,920
vibration as well.
Have you ever fucked around with

2781
02:14:06,921 --> 02:14:08,750
binaural beats?
I mean,

2782
02:14:08,751 --> 02:14:11,960
not for fun or like on record either for
fun.

2783
02:14:12,200 --> 02:14:14,960
I haven't done it either way,
but I know that it's real.

2784
02:14:14,990 --> 02:14:19,890
I mean I know that people swear by it.
It affects your brainwaves.

2785
02:14:20,170 --> 02:14:22,150
There's a reason all these trials
throughout history,

2786
02:14:22,151 --> 02:14:24,970
out in the middle of nowhere or banging
on drums will know when they're doing

2787
02:14:24,971 --> 02:14:25,930
their thing.
Yeah.

2788
02:14:26,070 --> 02:14:28,770
Oh Man.
There's a ICAROS.

2789
02:14:29,100 --> 02:14:31,330
You've got all those.
I don't know how they say that.

2790
02:14:31,500 --> 02:14:36,500
You play when you do dmt and the DMT
entities danced to the ICO.

2791
02:14:38,101 --> 02:14:41,340
Rose.
I mean like it's a part of the thing,

2792
02:14:41,490 --> 02:14:43,820
like when you do them together then you
understand.

2793
02:14:43,840 --> 02:14:45,810
If you listen to the music
independently,

2794
02:14:45,820 --> 02:14:48,090
like fucking weird music.
It's kind of trippy,

2795
02:14:48,091 --> 02:14:52,530
but it's weird.
I think this is meant for people.

2796
02:14:52,531 --> 02:14:53,940
That hundred percent.
Yeah.

2797
02:14:54,060 --> 02:14:56,400
Yeah.
Well this is created by a shaman.

2798
02:14:56,720 --> 02:14:59,070
This,
this the one that I have on my phone

2799
02:14:59,400 --> 02:15:04,400
that I play is created by a shaman.
It's by this guy.

2800
02:15:04,711 --> 02:15:09,711
Let me see if I was homeboy's name here.
I think his name is actually on the um,

2801
02:15:11,190 --> 02:15:12,510
on the recording itself.

2802
02:15:15,920 --> 02:15:17,200
God Damn it.
I don't have it on this.

2803
02:15:17,550 --> 02:15:18,850
I was going to say that you think it's
meant.

2804
02:15:18,890 --> 02:15:22,900
I mean other than the people who are
naturally from those areas where these

2805
02:15:22,901 --> 02:15:27,460
things grow out of the ground and occur
and they use them to connect with on a

2806
02:15:27,461 --> 02:15:30,550
religious level,
their spirit animals and things they

2807
02:15:30,551 --> 02:15:32,440
believe in,
but you like the tourists going down

2808
02:15:32,441 --> 02:15:33,460
there and drinking that shit.

2809
02:15:34,660 --> 02:15:35,493
Uh,

2810
02:15:36,360 --> 02:15:37,350
how do you feel about that?

2811
02:15:37,700 --> 02:15:39,860
Well,
it's like everything else.

2812
02:15:40,010 --> 02:15:43,880
You're going to get legit ones and then
you're going to get people that realize

2813
02:15:43,881 --> 02:15:46,880
there's a lot of money in tourists
coming out here and taking this wacky

2814
02:15:46,940 --> 02:15:48,680
shared.
And so they figured out how to make it.

2815
02:15:49,250 --> 02:15:51,890
So you're going to get people that are
taking advantage of people.

2816
02:15:51,891 --> 02:15:56,891
You got to get people that are doing all
sorts of negative shit and then you're

2817
02:15:57,021 --> 02:16:01,970
going to get legit Shaman people that
are legitimately involved in the

2818
02:16:01,971 --> 02:16:06,971
spiritual quest of attaining
enlightenment and reaching a neighboring

2819
02:16:08,571 --> 02:16:11,390
dimension,
like they really believe that they're

2820
02:16:11,420 --> 02:16:15,620
reaching a neighboring dimension that
they're tapping into something that's

2821
02:16:15,621 --> 02:16:19,010
around us all the time,
but then we don't have access to in a

2822
02:16:19,011 --> 02:16:22,970
normal state of consciousness.
And it's a well of souls who tapping

2823
02:16:22,971 --> 02:16:25,190
into.
It's something.

2824
02:16:25,240 --> 02:16:28,250
I mean,
it's real easy to dismiss,

2825
02:16:28,251 --> 02:16:29,860
especially for someone never experienced
it.

2826
02:16:29,861 --> 02:16:29,980
It's

2827
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:32,290
really easy to dismiss and say it's all
in your imagination,

2828
02:16:32,650 --> 02:16:35,950
but for someone who has experienced it,
it's very difficult to accept.

2829
02:16:36,310 --> 02:16:39,460
And it's very difficult for you to say
that you know,

2830
02:16:39,461 --> 02:16:42,430
for sure that it's all your imagination
if you haven't experienced it.

2831
02:16:42,660 --> 02:16:43,680
I see.
It's a very,

2832
02:16:43,860 --> 02:16:46,650
I appreciate from a,
from a,

2833
02:16:46,660 --> 02:16:47,380
um,
uh,

2834
02:16:47,380 --> 02:16:51,610
an intelligence standpoint,
someone's perspective on it that hasn't

2835
02:16:51,611 --> 02:16:54,250
experienced it.
But the reality is,

2836
02:16:54,340 --> 02:16:58,030
until you know what you're talking,
until you've actually gone into that

2837
02:16:58,031 --> 02:17:01,720
thing and know how titanic,
the alien it is,

2838
02:17:02,300 --> 02:17:05,770
you really just saying things,
you're just making noises with your

2839
02:17:05,771 --> 02:17:08,410
mouth and you know what?
There's no way you could know.

2840
02:17:08,560 --> 02:17:09,970
It's not like it's,
well,

2841
02:17:09,971 --> 02:17:11,940
I had a dream once and it was kind of
saying,

2842
02:17:12,110 --> 02:17:13,450
no,
no,

2843
02:17:13,510 --> 02:17:14,343
no,
it's.

2844
02:17:14,390 --> 02:17:17,200
You're not there anymore.
You go to a different place.

2845
02:17:17,201 --> 02:17:19,900
You experience a different reality.

2846
02:17:19,930 --> 02:17:22,930
More real than what we normally
interpret it as reality.

2847
02:17:23,020 --> 02:17:28,020
That's the most fucked up part about it
is it's so much crisper and more vibrant

2848
02:17:28,241 --> 02:17:31,960
and brighter,
and then reality itself seems muted in

2849
02:17:31,961 --> 02:17:34,120
some odd way.
It's almost like we're,

2850
02:17:34,130 --> 02:17:34,820
we're,
we're,

2851
02:17:34,820 --> 02:17:37,540
we're like having sex with a condom on,
you know,

2852
02:17:37,541 --> 02:17:40,150
and a big thick fucking trash bag,
condom.

2853
02:17:40,450 --> 02:17:44,740
And when you pass through to whatever
the fuck this other dimension is that

2854
02:17:44,741 --> 02:17:45,890
filter the,
the,

2855
02:17:45,910 --> 02:17:50,910
the frosted window is removed and you
could see it all the fog is gone,

2856
02:17:50,981 --> 02:17:55,981
the clouds are gone and you just boom,
gets shot through a cannon to the middle

2857
02:17:56,921 --> 02:17:59,320
of reality.
And that middle of reality of some

2858
02:17:59,321 --> 02:18:04,180
strange geometric living environment
where there's no,

2859
02:18:04,181 --> 02:18:06,060
um,
there's no three dimensional objects in

2860
02:18:06,160 --> 02:18:10,210
it that aren't touching each other.
Everything is connected to everything

2861
02:18:10,211 --> 02:18:11,560
else.
Like there's a bunch of different

2862
02:18:11,561 --> 02:18:12,130
things.

2863
02:18:12,130 --> 02:18:13,840
They're constantly alternating all the
time,

2864
02:18:14,050 --> 02:18:17,890
but there's no space between anything.
There's no space between you and me.

2865
02:18:18,270 --> 02:18:20,350
Not In that world.
It doesn't exist.

2866
02:18:20,351 --> 02:18:21,790
There's no space.
Everything is.

2867
02:18:21,791 --> 02:18:25,210
Everything is all together.
It's all together.

2868
02:18:25,211 --> 02:18:28,090
And you feel altogether like for the
first time ever,

2869
02:18:28,240 --> 02:18:33,240
you don't feel like you're sitting in
Canoga Park in a chair with a roof over

2870
02:18:33,731 --> 02:18:36,850
your head and above that roof of the sky
and above the skies the moon.

2871
02:18:36,860 --> 02:18:41,800
You don't feel that when you're in this,
you feel like you feel down infinite.

2872
02:18:41,801 --> 02:18:43,840
You feel to the left and to the right,
infinite.

2873
02:18:43,841 --> 02:18:46,810
You feel above.
But you also feel like you're in a room

2874
02:18:47,520 --> 02:18:49,820
and it feels fractal and it's,
oh,

2875
02:18:49,821 --> 02:18:51,880
it's fucking crazy.
So,

2876
02:18:51,881 --> 02:18:54,370
I mean,
it might all be in your imagination,

2877
02:18:54,610 --> 02:18:57,490
but my take on it has always been,
even if it is,

2878
02:18:57,730 --> 02:19:01,300
even if you're not going to a well of
souls and experiencing God and

2879
02:19:01,301 --> 02:19:06,280
experiencing purity and wisdom,
it's the same exact experience as if you

2880
02:19:06,281 --> 02:19:09,310
were so.
Even if it is in your imagination,

2881
02:19:09,340 --> 02:19:13,600
your imagination has pretty cool.
Fucking amazing.

2882
02:19:14,050 --> 02:19:16,270
I mean it might,
it might be.

2883
02:19:16,271 --> 02:19:19,600
That's what you're experiencing it.
It very well might be.

2884
02:19:21,030 --> 02:19:23,420
It's you don't know,
and there's no way to tell.

2885
02:19:23,450 --> 02:19:26,380
It's easy to be cynical.
It's easy to be dismissive.

2886
02:19:26,470 --> 02:19:27,560
It's easy to say,
oh,

2887
02:19:27,561 --> 02:19:28,040
come on,

2888
02:19:28,040 --> 02:19:30,470
he's fucking hippies.
They think they're experiencing God

2889
02:19:30,770 --> 02:19:34,130
through some powder that they smoke in a
way to go meet head.

2890
02:19:34,220 --> 02:19:34,731
Yeah.
Yeah.

2891
02:19:34,731 --> 02:19:36,010
You really are.
It's a really.

2892
02:19:36,011 --> 02:19:36,890
I mean,
it's cute.

2893
02:19:36,891 --> 02:19:39,140
It's fun to do.
It's easy to dismiss it,

2894
02:19:39,380 --> 02:19:41,720
but once you do it,
there's no dismissing it.

2895
02:19:41,750 --> 02:19:43,880
When you're there,
there's no dismissing it.

2896
02:19:44,270 --> 02:19:46,790
There's no easy explanation.
There's no easy anything.

2897
02:19:46,791 --> 02:19:47,990
Once you're there,
once you're in there,

2898
02:19:47,991 --> 02:19:49,100
you better let go.
Bitch.

2899
02:19:49,640 --> 02:19:51,980
You better go.
You better not try to fucking wrap your

2900
02:19:51,981 --> 02:19:54,890
head around this,
just breathe and try not to freak out.

2901
02:19:56,720 --> 02:19:58,130
And with that note,
ladies and gentlemen,

2902
02:19:59,990 --> 02:20:00,860
what are you doing in town?
Man?

2903
02:20:01,370 --> 02:20:04,020
I got to do A.
I gotta.

2904
02:20:04,090 --> 02:20:08,840
I gotta do anything.
We are getting ready to put a record out

2905
02:20:08,900 --> 02:20:13,900
and tomorrow we're taping a live show
for radio station and then Wednesday

2906
02:20:15,111 --> 02:20:17,690
we're taping a song for Conan.
Oh beautiful.

2907
02:20:17,740 --> 02:20:20,120
And then so just a little quick,
quick trip out,

2908
02:20:20,430 --> 02:20:24,110
get to get to finally get the new band
at a rehearsal space and see what's

2909
02:20:24,111 --> 02:20:25,220
going on though.
I'm excited.

2910
02:20:25,710 --> 02:20:27,930
Nice.
That's fun.

2911
02:20:27,931 --> 02:20:30,290
Last time I went with you to Conan,
I never.

2912
02:20:30,850 --> 02:20:31,890
Yeah,
it was fun man.

2913
02:20:32,010 --> 02:20:36,960
You know those tv things as they go.
It's always a strange dynamic,

2914
02:20:37,340 --> 02:20:39,270
you know,
even even for performance because you

2915
02:20:39,271 --> 02:20:42,230
get there and you do it and you wait and
you do it again for tv and you know and

2916
02:20:42,231 --> 02:20:43,620
you need to do it and you wait.
You wait and wait.

2917
02:20:43,621 --> 02:20:45,840
But if all of the ones that we played,
I think that one,

2918
02:20:45,841 --> 02:20:48,120
and maybe it's just because it's in
California,

2919
02:20:48,130 --> 02:20:50,310
where there's a far more mellow,
laid back vibe.

2920
02:20:50,550 --> 02:20:52,980
I think Cohen has a really nice studio
spaces bigger,

2921
02:20:52,981 --> 02:20:54,860
louder than New York.
Was it still fun with her older,

2922
02:20:54,880 --> 02:20:57,130
more tight buildings and the union crews
are on it,

2923
02:20:57,170 --> 02:20:58,660
you know,
they're running a crack tight,

2924
02:20:59,430 --> 02:21:02,160
um,
which may be a better thing to keep your

2925
02:21:02,161 --> 02:21:04,390
adrenaline up.
Oh yeah.

2926
02:21:04,391 --> 02:21:06,080
We sat around all day and then at 4:30
like,

2927
02:21:06,081 --> 02:21:07,170
okay,
you're on a two minutes,

2928
02:21:07,171 --> 02:21:09,690
you know,
by the way millions of people are going

2929
02:21:09,691 --> 02:21:10,620
to watch this.
Like,

2930
02:21:10,710 --> 02:21:14,880
so when is this going to be on a that
I'm not sure we're taping it because

2931
02:21:14,881 --> 02:21:19,590
we're out here for the other thing as
opposed to waiting until the fall when

2932
02:21:19,591 --> 02:21:23,200
we're actually her on tour.
So it was bringing everybody out and

2933
02:21:23,670 --> 02:21:25,050
we've done it twice.
But yeah,

2934
02:21:25,051 --> 02:21:26,430
him and Andy,
they'd been great to us,

2935
02:21:26,431 --> 02:21:26,840
man.

2936
02:21:26,840 --> 02:21:27,710
No,
they're awesome man.

2937
02:21:27,740 --> 02:21:30,140
He's a great guy.
He's a well known,

2938
02:21:30,200 --> 02:21:31,270
nice guy.
Really.

2939
02:21:31,600 --> 02:21:33,590
Can you tell?
He's doing a show,

2940
02:21:33,760 --> 02:21:38,150
sees a genuine music lover to listen.
Man has always been fun.

2941
02:21:38,180 --> 02:21:41,580
We've got to do this more often.
Fuck and startle Sampson.

2942
02:21:41,630 --> 02:21:43,450
Apparently.
I'll be coming here every once in a

2943
02:21:43,600 --> 02:21:45,270
while.
Alright,

2944
02:21:45,320 --> 02:21:47,930
ladies and gentlemen,
we'll be back tomorrow with Kevin rose.

2945
02:21:48,290 --> 02:21:49,123
See you that later.

2946
02:21:52,590 --> 02:21:53,120
Oh yeah.
