1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:03,773
Okay.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:05,140
Four,

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:05,973
three,

4
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:06,940
two,

5
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:07,773
one.

6
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:08,740
And we're alive.

7
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,510
So what am I not supposed to say?

8
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:11,380
Huh?

9
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:11,820
Oh,

10
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:12,810
a cunt.

11
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:13,790
Oh yeah,

12
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:14,623
that's all right.

13
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,311
That's the title.

14
00:00:15,311 --> 00:00:16,180
The title of the show that we've,

15
00:00:16,181 --> 00:00:16,451
we've,

16
00:00:16,451 --> 00:00:16,781
we've,

17
00:00:16,781 --> 00:00:17,614
uh,

18
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:18,101
uh,

19
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:22,090
omitted from the print listings is a,

20
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:22,301
yeah.

21
00:00:22,301 --> 00:00:22,961
The show is actually called,

22
00:00:22,961 --> 00:00:23,794
don't say cunt.

23
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:24,460
Oh,

24
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,830
with Paul and guys,

25
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,270
this is the one place where you're
not going to hear the word count.

26
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:28,770
Yeah.

27
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,880
So it kind of a Pronto for five minutes.

28
00:00:30,881 --> 00:00:34,420
There'll be 45 minutes because as we
understand that Americans don't like the

29
00:00:34,421 --> 00:00:35,230
word count.

30
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,250
Some Americans.

31
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:36,760
Yeah,

32
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,870
it's getting number.

33
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:38,890
That's what we'll,

34
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:39,340
yeah,

35
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:39,790
we'll get,

36
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:40,480
we'll get one.

37
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,140
Until that day there was a,

38
00:00:42,141 --> 00:00:44,580
there's a bunch of women that
were trying to take it back.

39
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:45,040
Who Was it?

40
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:45,873
Was that the,

41
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,260
the guys we fucked girls.

42
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,083
I think it was,

43
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,450
they were trying to take it
back through trying to like you,

44
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:51,970
you know,

45
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:53,770
take that and cut back the word.

46
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:54,191
Well,

47
00:00:54,191 --> 00:00:56,830
I think I'm very dead inside my head.

48
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:57,520
What's the matter,

49
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,280
David here?

50
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,090
David.

51
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:00,040
David's having this dry.

52
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:00,610
Oh,

53
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:00,911
it might,

54
00:01:00,911 --> 00:01:01,960
it might have disconnected.

55
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:02,440
Yeah.

56
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,130
This is fun.

57
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:03,741
For the huge Amy.

58
00:01:03,741 --> 00:01:04,574
I'll hook it up.

59
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:06,550
Did you go your okay.

60
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,540
You might plug in.

61
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,790
There's a little bit of an issue.

62
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,130
I feel like there's a
pressure differential.

63
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:13,503
That's a bird feeling.

64
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,250
You only have one ear on to,

65
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:15,491
Oh,

66
00:01:15,491 --> 00:01:16,241
you're both of them on.

67
00:01:16,241 --> 00:01:16,661
They got in mind.

68
00:01:16,661 --> 00:01:16,781
Yeah,

69
00:01:16,781 --> 00:01:18,220
I took it off because they
couldn't hear anything.

70
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:18,521
Check,

71
00:01:18,521 --> 00:01:18,761
check,

72
00:01:18,761 --> 00:01:19,031
check,

73
00:01:19,031 --> 00:01:19,241
check.

74
00:01:19,241 --> 00:01:19,451
One,

75
00:01:19,451 --> 00:01:19,661
two,

76
00:01:19,661 --> 00:01:19,931
three,

77
00:01:19,931 --> 00:01:20,171
four,

78
00:01:20,171 --> 00:01:21,004
five,

79
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,540
a little.

80
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:22,871
No,

81
00:01:22,871 --> 00:01:23,381
that's Paul.

82
00:01:23,381 --> 00:01:23,921
Apparently.

83
00:01:23,921 --> 00:01:24,551
I think check,

84
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:24,791
check,

85
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:25,031
check.

86
00:01:25,031 --> 00:01:25,571
That's me.

87
00:01:25,571 --> 00:01:26,051
That's me.

88
00:01:26,051 --> 00:01:26,700
I can hear now.

89
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,040
Okay.

90
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,880
There are going to be down.

91
00:01:27,881 --> 00:01:29,590
Just something that somebody is in here.

92
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:30,803
Gremlins

93
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,190
monkeying with the fucking side.

94
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:34,571
We're not.

95
00:01:34,571 --> 00:01:35,770
Hold on which one was being,

96
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,470
I'm going to just adjust our shelf.

97
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,190
This one.

98
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:38,980
Oh,

99
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:39,371
there you go.

100
00:01:39,371 --> 00:01:40,051
Hold on one,

101
00:01:40,051 --> 00:01:40,241
one,

102
00:01:40,241 --> 00:01:40,440
one,

103
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,200
one,

104
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,411
one,

105
00:01:41,411 --> 00:01:41,621
one,

106
00:01:41,621 --> 00:01:41,861
one,

107
00:01:41,861 --> 00:01:42,160
one.

108
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:42,580
I hear me,

109
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:42,910
Dave.

110
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:43,270
There we go.

111
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:43,661
There we go.

112
00:01:43,661 --> 00:01:44,200
That's good.

113
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,550
So I always hear Dave.

114
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,180
So why,

115
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,640
why did you choose that
as your podcast title?

116
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,770
We're Canadians and a content is not as,

117
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,680
not nearly as bad and
Canada's really swear word.

118
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,230
Yeah,

119
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:56,650
it,

120
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,483
yeah.

121
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,530
I don't know what they need to put out.

122
00:01:59,531 --> 00:02:02,920
Some sort of a periodic table of
the atomic weight of swear words

123
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,300
would be quite,

124
00:02:07,301 --> 00:02:09,880
quite heavy but heavier
on the American version.

125
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:10,923
But here,

126
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,863
uh,

127
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,920
in America con actually just drop through
the crust of the earth and right down

128
00:02:18,281 --> 00:02:19,990
to the core you will go
through the other side.

129
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,550
So I guess we just found
that patently ridiculous.

130
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:24,970
Well,

131
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:25,720
we use,

132
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,553
we like,

133
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:27,723
um,

134
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:28,743
you know,

135
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,673
we,

136
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:31,541
we grew up,

137
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:33,790
I grew up hearing the word a lot from my,

138
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,080
my dad.

139
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,780
What does your dad like?

140
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:38,783
Well,

141
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,840
not like much anymore.

142
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:41,830
He's dead.

143
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:42,520
Thanks.

144
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,151
So he died.

145
00:02:43,151 --> 00:02:44,110
He died in [inaudible] 79.

146
00:02:44,111 --> 00:02:44,861
Sorry Dude,

147
00:02:44,861 --> 00:02:45,694
I didn't 79,

148
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,980
but no,

149
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,791
as I always say,

150
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:49,511
he was mad.

151
00:02:49,511 --> 00:02:51,220
There are no better
parents than dead parents.

152
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:52,140
No,

153
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,200
they can't fuck you up anymore.

154
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:53,890
That's right.

155
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:58,890
But my dad was a real really fond
of that word and English Canadian.

156
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,661
He full Canadian.

157
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:05,920
But being Canadian is kind of like being
English a little bit on your money's

158
00:03:05,921 --> 00:03:06,754
still.

159
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,590
And we get all the
English movies on English,

160
00:03:08,591 --> 00:03:12,280
TV show we a pledge
allegiance to the queen.

161
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:12,940
And school,

162
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:13,241
you know,

163
00:03:13,241 --> 00:03:14,150
and I still,

164
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,550
so it's still going on possibly.

165
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:15,940
Yeah.

166
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,810
And in our sleep,

167
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,870
so many good things about
Canada yet so many preposterous.

168
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:20,671
It's true.

169
00:03:20,671 --> 00:03:21,340
It's the fact,

170
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:21,431
well,

171
00:03:21,431 --> 00:03:25,690
the fact that a monarchy still exists at
all is preposterous as great on paper.

172
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:26,843
Yeah.

173
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:28,780
Well the monarchy,

174
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,651
even itself,

175
00:03:29,651 --> 00:03:29,881
it's,

176
00:03:29,881 --> 00:03:31,080
it's become Kardashians.

177
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,410
Refied well yeah,

178
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,593
like I love him,

179
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,340
but didn't they weren't they always,

180
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,660
I guess they were,

181
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:37,981
I mean,

182
00:03:37,981 --> 00:03:38,131
what,

183
00:03:38,131 --> 00:03:39,760
tell prince died days and,

184
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:40,330
yeah.

185
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,010
Or even just back to Henry the eighth.

186
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:43,060
What,

187
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,000
what maintained the,

188
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:48,940
the monarchy other than the fact that
people wanted celebrities and that was the

189
00:03:48,941 --> 00:03:50,140
only celebrities they had.

190
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:50,680
Right.

191
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,630
And the priests and I think Henry,

192
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,730
they also had ass implants if I'm,

193
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,240
yeah,

194
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,073
cause he did.

195
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:56,950
Yeah.

196
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:57,250
Yeah.

197
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:57,660
Wow.

198
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,060
Yeah.

199
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:58,893
Good for him.

200
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,890
Progressive.

201
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:00,370
Yup.

202
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,203
So ahead of his time.

203
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:01,870
Yeah.

204
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,250
That,

205
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,400
that is an interesting thing.

206
00:04:03,401 --> 00:04:05,500
It's like the Prince Charles Lady,

207
00:04:05,501 --> 00:04:10,501
Di's saga was essentially one of
our first reality things to enjoy.

208
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,230
Yeah.

209
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:11,650
Yes.

210
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,020
That was madness when it happened.

211
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:14,920
It was so huge.

212
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:15,730
And then someone said,

213
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:15,821
well,

214
00:04:15,821 --> 00:04:20,821
what if we just make housewives
in orange county royalty and a,

215
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:25,090
and you don't have to pay them as much
as the king and Queen and you can cancel

216
00:04:25,091 --> 00:04:25,510
them.

217
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,343
Yeah.

218
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,420
Those shows are wonderful there.

219
00:04:28,421 --> 00:04:31,090
I've never seen an episode
of any of their fascinating.

220
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,820
The Beverly Hills one is there was,

221
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:33,071
well,

222
00:04:33,071 --> 00:04:34,870
there's different versions of them,

223
00:04:34,871 --> 00:04:35,151
right.

224
00:04:35,151 --> 00:04:35,970
And different versions.

225
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:39,940
You get to see the geographical creepiness
of like Atlanta is its own thing.

226
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:40,301
Yeah.

227
00:04:40,301 --> 00:04:41,560
Atlanta is not a bad one.

228
00:04:41,561 --> 00:04:43,150
The worst one was jersey.

229
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,250
They're fucking savage people.

230
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,680
My ancestors,

231
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:51,270
those fucking savage monkey
folk that live in the worst.

232
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,930
Anything cut the first of the version,

233
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,550
the worst of anything.

234
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,121
The worst.

235
00:04:55,121 --> 00:04:55,511
The worst.

236
00:04:55,511 --> 00:04:57,370
Penicillin is the Jersey Penicillin.

237
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:57,770
You know,

238
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:00,100
CSI Jersey was terrible by the way.

239
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:00,731
Nah,

240
00:05:00,731 --> 00:05:01,564
that doesn't exist.

241
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:04,360
Yeah.

242
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,680
I'm the Beverly Hills.

243
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:06,540
One of the,

244
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,240
all of them were
fascinating and it was take,

245
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,620
take people forced them in these
situations where they're going to have his

246
00:05:11,621 --> 00:05:12,640
artificial disputes.

247
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:12,921
Well,

248
00:05:12,921 --> 00:05:17,921
it was crazy to me is watching people
succumb to the pressure of all of that

249
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:18,620
attention.

250
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:18,910
Wouldn't,

251
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,470
they've never experienced it before.

252
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:24,370
And then you're going to just thrust
them into this massively popular,

253
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,593
you know,

254
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:26,890
for lack of a better word,

255
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,753
confessed.

256
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:28,520
Yeah.

257
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,290
Right.

258
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:29,441
Well,

259
00:05:29,441 --> 00:05:31,630
if you take your test fame,

260
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,160
yeah.

261
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,230
I need divorce it up.

262
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,620
Any supporting sort of supporting
under talent structure.

263
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,450
Yes.

264
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:40,280
Or didn't support,

265
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,113
sorry.

266
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,820
Nothing to offer.

267
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,480
No offering.

268
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,710
There's no painting,

269
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:45,723
no sculptor.

270
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,650
He's still singing.

271
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,220
They only take yes.

272
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,570
Give cause fame will destroy.

273
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,160
If you're a brilliant artist,

274
00:05:51,161 --> 00:05:52,060
fame will destroy you.

275
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,850
If there's nothing underneath the fame,

276
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:55,631
it's this,

277
00:05:55,631 --> 00:05:57,070
there's nothing to hold it up.

278
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,930
While I remember watching
Kelsey Grammer's wife,

279
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,280
I had met her before,

280
00:06:01,281 --> 00:06:02,750
she seemed like a very nice lady.

281
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:03,640
Camille,

282
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,100
Camille.

283
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:04,940
And then she,

284
00:06:04,941 --> 00:06:05,051
uh,

285
00:06:05,051 --> 00:06:05,601
I forgot her name.

286
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:06,434
Thank you.

287
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,140
I didn't want to just contact owner.

288
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,400
He has a huge Camille Fan.

289
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,463
I have a tattoo.

290
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,221
I was gonna say,

291
00:06:13,221 --> 00:06:14,060
do you have a tattoo?

292
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:18,470
But she decided to play the heel.

293
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,390
And the Prac,

294
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:23,630
it was so obvious that the
pressure was just overwhelming.

295
00:06:23,631 --> 00:06:25,850
The hatred that was coming her way.

296
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:29,750
She had decided she was going to be
the boss bitch on the show and just let

297
00:06:29,751 --> 00:06:30,491
everybody know,

298
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:30,800
you know,

299
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,120
this is how it is and I'm,

300
00:06:32,121 --> 00:06:36,800
I'm here to run things and
just the swamp of evil.

301
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,450
That came her way and then she's like,

302
00:06:38,451 --> 00:06:39,770
God quit done.

303
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,700
Fuck this show.

304
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,101
And she,

305
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:41,990
she bailed out of it.

306
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,220
Good for her.

307
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,053
Yeah.

308
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:48,410
It's even changed that role or was it
like a producer and said here's your,

309
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:51,860
well according to Kelsey he told her like,

310
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:52,101
Hey,

311
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:52,431
okay,

312
00:06:52,431 --> 00:06:54,110
this is what you've always wanted here.

313
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,070
Like cause that's like what led to their
divorce or what was happening during

314
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,780
then them getting divorced,

315
00:06:59,781 --> 00:07:00,041
you know,

316
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:00,920
and essentially said,

317
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:01,851
you know,

318
00:07:01,851 --> 00:07:03,350
this is what you've always wanted.

319
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,840
Like don't think you understand this,

320
00:07:05,841 --> 00:07:07,580
so go to the good luck with it.

321
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,511
And then you know,

322
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:08,900
she,

323
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,480
she just kind of vanished afterwards.

324
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:11,691
She's like,

325
00:07:11,691 --> 00:07:12,524
fuck all this,

326
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,120
which is wise on her part.

327
00:07:14,121 --> 00:07:14,351
She,

328
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:14,750
she,

329
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,730
she recognize what it is,

330
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:17,981
but they're like those,

331
00:07:17,981 --> 00:07:19,130
those people that are on it.

332
00:07:19,131 --> 00:07:19,461
Like,

333
00:07:19,461 --> 00:07:23,410
I know some people who know some
folks that are on that show and it's,

334
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,440
they'd just go crazy.

335
00:07:24,441 --> 00:07:26,690
They start to pop and pills
and losing their mind.

336
00:07:26,691 --> 00:07:29,450
They're in therapy every
day and it's just madness.

337
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:30,050
Yeah.

338
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:35,050
That desire for fame with nothing more
to it than other than a desire to be

339
00:07:35,271 --> 00:07:37,400
famous can only drive you insane.

340
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:37,690
Yeah.

341
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:38,481
Cause I think fame,

342
00:07:38,481 --> 00:07:39,231
fame as a,

343
00:07:39,231 --> 00:07:42,980
as an emergent property of doing
something right is bearable,

344
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:48,350
but it's products but so strange
and so difficult to truly manage.

345
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,430
But you can at least say,

346
00:07:49,431 --> 00:07:51,620
I don't define myself by the fame.

347
00:07:51,621 --> 00:07:54,520
I define myself by the
work that created the fame.

348
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,041
Yes,

349
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:55,320
yes.

350
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,810
Whereas if there's no work underneath it,

351
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,673
it's,

352
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,170
you know,

353
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:01,940
you only exist in so much
as people are aware of you.

354
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,960
You exist in those moments when you walk
into a room and everyone's staring at

355
00:08:05,961 --> 00:08:06,580
you.

356
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,640
That's what you look for.

357
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,533
And that's that.

358
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,600
I have that anyway because of my body.

359
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,780
So I guess I know real famous.

360
00:08:14,781 --> 00:08:15,614
Right.

361
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,700
And your and the horrible
allergy you have to pants.

362
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,400
True.

363
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,270
I can't wear pants.

364
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:21,560
Yeah.

365
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,550
Every time I walk in a room.

366
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:22,731
Well,

367
00:08:22,731 --> 00:08:23,564
I always say like that,

368
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,460
that uh,

369
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,230
that fame is a property of the beholder,

370
00:08:27,231 --> 00:08:28,064
not the beheld.

371
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,510
And that that fame only exists along long.

372
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,180
Somebody in the room knows who you are,

373
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:32,620
right?

374
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,081
In a minute,

375
00:08:33,081 --> 00:08:34,340
you're in a room where no one knows you,

376
00:08:34,341 --> 00:08:35,630
your fame evaporates.

377
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:39,080
That is one of the weirdest interrogations
I've ever gotten is when people go,

378
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:39,770
Woo,

379
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:40,870
why did these people know you?

380
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,153
What do you do?

381
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:43,550
Who are you and shit.

382
00:08:43,551 --> 00:08:44,090
I know.

383
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:44,630
Yeah.

384
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,260
I take a photo with you there.

385
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:46,941
Where somebody,

386
00:08:46,941 --> 00:08:47,970
but I don't know who they were.

387
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:48,261
Things.

388
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:52,600
They're almost defended that other
people know you and they go like,

389
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,770
why you're playing a game with me.

390
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,030
Why are you,

391
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:56,350
why?

392
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,360
Why don't I know you?

393
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,280
They get angry.

394
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,113
Yeah.

395
00:08:59,280 --> 00:08:59,491
Well,

396
00:08:59,491 --> 00:09:00,041
there also,

397
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,430
there's the other thing about famous that
people feel like they could just start

398
00:09:02,431 --> 00:09:03,264
talking to you.

399
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:03,691
Yes.

400
00:09:03,691 --> 00:09:04,260
Yeah.

401
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:04,860
Yes.

402
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,693
Yeah.

403
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:06,990
They can sit next to you.

404
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:07,921
Oh yeah.

405
00:09:07,921 --> 00:09:11,760
You could be in the middle of an intense
conversation with your favorite person

406
00:09:11,761 --> 00:09:12,330
on the planet.

407
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,163
They don't give a fuck.

408
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,900
Why didn't I know you
haven't been in their house.

409
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:16,590
I had a living room.

410
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,300
I had a guy come to me in
the street and just go,

411
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,141
Hey Dave,

412
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:19,800
how you doing?

413
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,221
And I thought,

414
00:09:20,221 --> 00:09:20,311
oh,

415
00:09:20,311 --> 00:09:20,851
it must know him.

416
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:21,180
So he said,

417
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:21,331
oh,

418
00:09:21,331 --> 00:09:21,811
I'm good.

419
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:22,644
How are you doing man?

420
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,080
And his next line was a,

421
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,290
you don't even know me.

422
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:27,300
You fucking phony,

423
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,101
David.

424
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:29,850
That was me.

425
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:30,420
That was you.

426
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,010
I wish I was better at faces.

427
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,880
Was this in Canada?

428
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,380
This was in downtown La.

429
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:34,831
Real.

430
00:09:34,831 --> 00:09:35,610
It's amazing.

431
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:36,151
Even know me.

432
00:09:36,151 --> 00:09:36,841
You fucking phony.

433
00:09:36,841 --> 00:09:37,760
I'm just trying to be nice.

434
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:38,703
Yes.

435
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:39,990
Was he a drunk?

436
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:40,470
No,

437
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,040
he was just,

438
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,850
he was a guy who just,

439
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:42,330
uh,

440
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,330
let me go pretend I know him.

441
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,100
It just watch this.

442
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:44,430
Wow.

443
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,660
Was that the end of the conversation?

444
00:09:45,661 --> 00:09:46,620
And that was basically it.

445
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:47,490
Wow.

446
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,181
What a rude person.

447
00:09:48,181 --> 00:09:49,590
That's a terrible conversation.

448
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,520
Probably guy who auditioned for news
radio in [inaudible] 96 I've just never

449
00:09:53,521 --> 00:09:54,354
gotten over it.

450
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:54,870
Yeah.

451
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:57,780
That fucking con one.

452
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,880
I was on my way to start
them and to be fair,

453
00:10:02,881 --> 00:10:03,714
it was me.

454
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,350
Tripped him up.

455
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,183
Yeah.

456
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,380
Um,

457
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,510
are you still doing
that show with a doctor,

458
00:10:09,511 --> 00:10:10,344
Ken?

459
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:10,930
No.

460
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:11,340
Uh,

461
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,720
we stopped when they canceled it.

462
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:13,643
Oh,

463
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,770
that's always a good move.

464
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:14,900
Yeah.

465
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:15,690
Not right away.

466
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:19,400
It's several months in a fairly good
kept doing the show after it was camp.

467
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:19,770
Yeah,

468
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:20,201
we didn't,

469
00:10:20,201 --> 00:10:21,540
we did called the doctors.

470
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:22,140
Is that what it's called?

471
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:22,973
No,

472
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:23,270
no,

473
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,103
no.

474
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:24,960
That's a real one.

475
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:26,791
I can't remember.

476
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:27,800
What was the name of it again?

477
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:28,730
We can still call Doctor Oz.

478
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,251
A real doctor.

479
00:10:29,251 --> 00:10:29,790
Right.

480
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:33,420
I don't think it's he's Fargo on is
drew once you've been pushed in front of

481
00:10:33,421 --> 00:10:34,254
Congress.

482
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:34,651
Yeah.

483
00:10:34,651 --> 00:10:36,720
And they question you on
your weight loss claims.

484
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,570
Yeah,

485
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,150

486
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:38,610

489
00:10:42,451 --> 00:10:43,281

490
00:10:43,281 --> 00:10:45,150
Can't that was it doctor Ken?

491
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,070
He just did a Netflix special.

492
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:47,731
He did.

493
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:47,850
He's,

Yeah.

496
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:51,450
He's one of the sweetest
guys on the planet earth.

497
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,350
He is a nice man.

Super good guy.

507
00:11:00,421 --> 00:11:01,254
You can join it,

516
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,170
It's a better job than most.

517
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:16,910

518
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:17,520

524
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:20,881
you know,

525
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:22,200
it's like when you're
doing something you'd like,

526
00:11:22,201 --> 00:11:23,520
there's a certain satisfaction,

527
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,481
but even then,

528
00:11:24,481 --> 00:11:26,010
even like when we were doing news radio,

529
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,600
you don't get to enjoy it because you're,

530
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:31,710
you're so focused on whatever the
flaws are while you're making it.

531
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:32,933
Right.

532
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:33,301
Yeah.

533
00:11:33,301 --> 00:11:34,980
You get to enjoy it during the wrap party.

534
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:35,820
Yeah.

535
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,270
Or,

536
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,260
or 20 years later,

537
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:37,820
right?

538
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,653
Yeah.

539
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,260
Yeah.

540
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:39,760
I,

541
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,110
um,

542
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:43,180
it's occasionally someone will send
me a clip online and it's just,

543
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,910
it's so strange to watch.

544
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,230
It's so strange when you're watching
yourself from 20 plus years ago.

545
00:11:49,231 --> 00:11:51,000
Say something you don't remember saying.

546
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,690
Yeah.

547
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:52,291
And then your watch,

548
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:52,441
like,

549
00:11:52,441 --> 00:11:52,621
wow,

550
00:11:52,621 --> 00:11:54,370
I don't even remember that episode at all.

551
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:55,210
Yeah.

552
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,000
I don't remember most,

553
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,260
I don't,

554
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,190
I never watched,

555
00:11:57,191 --> 00:11:59,110
I think I only watched about six episodes.

556
00:11:59,380 --> 00:11:59,850
Wow.

557
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:00,683
Is Radio.

558
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:01,210
Yeah.

559
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:02,230
And I loved the show.

560
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:03,160
But,

561
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,630
but you knew that he
didn't want to watch it.

562
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,620
You were there.

563
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:05,980
Yeah.

564
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:06,701
There what had happened.

565
00:12:06,701 --> 00:12:07,640
Yeah,

566
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:07,900
yeah.

567
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,291
If I bought,

568
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,120
all they'd be doing is
nitpicking the editing.

569
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:10,870
Right,

570
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:11,670
right.

571
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,503
Yeah.

572
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:16,590
It's a strange thing to
look back when you go back,

573
00:12:16,591 --> 00:12:16,820
you know,

574
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,390
20 plus years and think of all the,

575
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,250
all the scenes,

576
00:12:21,251 --> 00:12:22,031
all the writing,

577
00:12:22,031 --> 00:12:25,900
all the work and now it's just sort of
now w w that's the other thing that we

578
00:12:25,901 --> 00:12:28,210
never anticipated that it would
be floating around the Internet.

579
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,040
Yeah.

580
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,530
You know,

581
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:29,950
yeah.

582
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:30,890
Youtube clips,

583
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:31,661
nothing goes away.

584
00:12:31,661 --> 00:12:34,390
And he's radius floating way out
in the periphery of the Internet.

585
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,110
Yeah.

586
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:35,680
But you see,

587
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,360
she was like drawn in sometimes,

588
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,260
but shows like,

589
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:38,890
like,

590
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:39,360
uh,

591
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,091
like friends,

592
00:12:40,091 --> 00:12:40,610
like the fact,

593
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:40,991
you know,

594
00:12:40,991 --> 00:12:42,160
you have young kids,

595
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,740
like my daughter's 15,

596
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,560
she's watched every episode
of friends at least twice.

597
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,400
Wow.

598
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,780
10 that's 10 years of shows.

599
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,441
And it's not just here,

600
00:12:50,441 --> 00:12:52,750
it's every 15 year old in the country.

601
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:53,623
Yeah.

602
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,250
Has One.

603
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,850
And it's like that,

604
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:56,723
that,

605
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:57,071
you know,

606
00:12:57,071 --> 00:12:58,840
is coming back into
significant to these kids.

607
00:12:58,841 --> 00:12:59,050
Now,

608
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:02,800
what's fascinating is I don't think
those shows are being made anymore.

609
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:03,550
No,

610
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,120
not that.

611
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,000
Not like don't,

612
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:08,860
I mean there's the chuck Lorre
type shows that I watch and I go,

613
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,060
I'm missing a GM.

614
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,450
Why was like,

615
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:15,940
why is everyone laughing so hard to be
your seen those without the laugh track.

616
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:20,290
I can imagine that that
must be life taking some of
those shows and the Big Bang

617
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:23,440
theory and I would like to see that
they've removed the laugh track and you

618
00:13:23,441 --> 00:13:27,070
watch it with just the act or sing the
words and it's like it's anything funny

619
00:13:27,071 --> 00:13:27,760
ever happen on it.

620
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,593
Well it just,

621
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,800
it's strange.

622
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,210
It's like you're watching.

623
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:32,044
Um,

624
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,900
it doesn't make any sense.

625
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:36,880
It's a logical yeah.

626
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:37,331
And that,

627
00:13:37,331 --> 00:13:37,601
that,

628
00:13:37,601 --> 00:13:38,380
that,

629
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,510
that place people get in their
heads where they just go,

630
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,493
it'll be fine.

631
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:41,920
Yeah,

632
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,250
yeah,

633
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,083
yeah.

634
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,380
News radio,

635
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,420
if we did a scene and
it didn't get a laugh,

636
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,710
we rewrote the whole seat.

637
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,280
Yeah.

638
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,290
Literally with the audience there.

639
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:50,651
Well,

640
00:13:50,651 --> 00:13:53,440
I think the term good enough
is perfect for comedy.

641
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:53,870
Yeah.

642
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:54,730
That's good enough.

643
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:57,750
People are kind of
chuckling while it's to you,

644
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:02,140
once you get a certain
number of characters that
you can get to interact with

645
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:04,960
each other and predictable
ways on those shows,

646
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:08,500
then they just sort of have them have
these little scenes and have different

647
00:14:08,501 --> 00:14:12,970
inflections and different stumbles
and they make a show out of it.

648
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,631
And for the audience,

649
00:14:13,631 --> 00:14:14,800
I think it just becomes comfort.

650
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:16,450
Familiarity.

651
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,050
I love it.

652
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:17,651
I maintain,

653
00:14:17,651 --> 00:14:19,360
that's what drove Charlie sheen crazy.

654
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,160
It was doing that Goddamn show.

655
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,000
Yeah,

656
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,170
he did for a long time.

657
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,370
For a long time.

658
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,960
I think that's what drove him to the edge.

659
00:14:25,961 --> 00:14:26,290
I thought.

660
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:27,430
I think he was always crazy.

661
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:30,850
But I think when you do a show that
you don't enjoy doing or that you don't

662
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,180
look,

663
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,010
the guy was in fucking platoon.

664
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:33,340
Yeah.

665
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:33,611
Right.

666
00:14:33,611 --> 00:14:33,910
Yeah.

667
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,070
I mean he was in some amazing pharaoh.

668
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:37,330
He wasn't very funny in that.

669
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,433
No,

670
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:39,663
it wasn't.

671
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:40,960
It was really kind of a bummer.

672
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:41,680
Yeah,

673
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,041
they should.

674
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:42,400
Uh,

675
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,630
they should have taken that as a warranty.

676
00:14:43,631 --> 00:14:43,751
Yeah.

677
00:14:43,751 --> 00:14:46,990
They should take that company Lindelof
that that should stop ending up on all

678
00:14:46,991 --> 00:14:47,824
those companies.

679
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,180
Wall Street.

680
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:49,421
I mean,

681
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:50,860
he was in some giant,

682
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:51,883
a good way,

683
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,230
the movies and then he's on the show.

684
00:14:54,231 --> 00:14:55,910
That doesn't really make sense.

685
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:56,170
Right?

686
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:56,600
Yeah.

687
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,860
And he's really talented.

688
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,450
Like he's really,

689
00:14:59,451 --> 00:15:01,970
really talented actor and really funny.

690
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,200
It's hilarious.

691
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,720
Like great timing.

692
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,250
Uh,

693
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:05,781
what was the,

694
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:05,980
uh,

695
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,560
like the,

696
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,393
uh,

697
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,840
like her brothers franchise,

698
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:09,350
uh,

699
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,183
hot shots.

700
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:11,320
Oh yeah,

701
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,153
that's right.

702
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:15,140
It was funny in those,

703
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,180
they don't make those
kind of movies anymore.

704
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,130
Like nobody does jokes anymore.

705
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,293
It doesn't say,

706
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,590
Nah,

707
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,550
can't do jokes.

708
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,080
Effort is frowned upon.

709
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,760
Think you have to be lazy with
your comedy movies or you know,

710
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,230
there's still comedy movies,

711
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:30,621
right?

712
00:15:30,621 --> 00:15:34,100
There's like the Judd Apatow
type films and you know,

713
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:34,641
there's still,

714
00:15:34,641 --> 00:15:36,290
they still make comedy movies,

715
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,370
but there's seems like
there's not as many anymore.

716
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,353
Yeah.

717
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,250
Or maybe I just don't go out as much.

718
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,120
There's a little bit of that too.

719
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:44,480
Yeah.

720
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,630
But it's also like the subject
matter is so dangerous now.

721
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,430
Like everything that used to be funny,

722
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:54,590
we watched ace Ventura pet detective
with my kids and I did not remember how

723
00:15:54,951 --> 00:15:56,630
transphobic that movie is.

724
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:00,040
Like the whole movie is
one gigantic Trans Joke.

725
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:01,603
It's true.

726
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,793
It's true.

727
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,120
I don't know if I've ever seen it.

728
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,481
At the end of it,

729
00:16:05,481 --> 00:16:05,811
I'm like,

730
00:16:05,811 --> 00:16:06,291
Whoa,

731
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:07,220
I forgot.

732
00:16:07,221 --> 00:16:08,180
This is crazy.

733
00:16:08,181 --> 00:16:09,410
Like the men,

734
00:16:09,411 --> 00:16:10,340
when they find that she's a girl,

735
00:16:10,341 --> 00:16:14,240
they're throwing up and or
the that she's a boy rather.

736
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:15,470
There's the brushing teeth.

737
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:16,230
Yeah.

738
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,780
The scrubbing and mouth out.

739
00:16:17,781 --> 00:16:18,860
Everyone's vomiting.

740
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,070
You wouldn't be skewered today.

741
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:23,990
You'd be finished.

742
00:16:23,991 --> 00:16:24,371
Yeah,

743
00:16:24,371 --> 00:16:24,860
it'd be done.

744
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,461
And they still,

745
00:16:25,461 --> 00:16:26,810
that whole joke from the crying game.

746
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:27,520
Ugh.

747
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,100
That's true.

748
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,310
Which is one of the funniest
movies I've ever seen it.

749
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,520
Which one came first?

750
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:32,601
I don't know.

751
00:16:32,601 --> 00:16:36,020
Any magic if the trunk crying game
did a serious version of Ace Ventura.

752
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:37,910
I feel like I have an idea.

753
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:40,780
Hey,

754
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:44,330
forgot about the crying get whole ass
talking scene would be totally different.

755
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,410
Yeah.

756
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:45,860
I thought,

757
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,660
I remember watching the crank game going,

758
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,583
uh,

759
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,630
and heard there's this big twist,

760
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,700
big surprise twist.

761
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,653
And that's the guy.

762
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,330
I bet.

763
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:53,631
I bet.

764
00:16:53,631 --> 00:16:54,550
What happens is that the,

765
00:16:54,551 --> 00:16:55,031
that the,

766
00:16:55,031 --> 00:16:57,920
the transvestite turns
out to be an IRA spy

767
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,150
because you were already two steps ahead.

768
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,533
Yo,

769
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,600
I forgot that movie.

770
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:06,943
Yeah.

771
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:07,541
So,

772
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:07,701
wow.

773
00:17:07,701 --> 00:17:09,080
How long have you guys
been doing this podcast?

774
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,083
This is how long?

775
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,270
It's just before Christmas.

776
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:13,863
Yeah.

777
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:14,800
Yeah.

778
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,100
Probably each other.

779
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:17,570
We've known each other a lot.

780
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:21,050
Like what motivated our wives to say,

781
00:17:21,051 --> 00:17:21,890
get the fuck out of here,

782
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,241
out of the house.

783
00:17:23,241 --> 00:17:27,590
Pretty much that's it was go do
something new somewhere else.

784
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:28,491
And uh,

785
00:17:28,491 --> 00:17:30,890
and they actually on the podcast with us,

786
00:17:30,891 --> 00:17:31,130
like,

787
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:31,650
uh,

788
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:32,031
Chrissy,

789
00:17:32,031 --> 00:17:34,940
my wife produces it and
puts it all together.

790
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:36,003
Jack Harris,

791
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,570
super hard to fire it.

792
00:17:38,571 --> 00:17:39,404
Did well,

793
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,120
were the ones who will get fired.

794
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,920
He fired me once as a 10
years right now for pain.

795
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,480
But Chrissy and I were,

796
00:17:47,481 --> 00:17:48,890
we separated for 10 years.

797
00:17:48,891 --> 00:17:49,080
Well,

798
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:49,350
you,

799
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:49,621
well,

800
00:17:49,621 --> 00:17:50,454
uh,

801
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,210
well actually last time I saw you
as well during that separation.

802
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,653
Um,

803
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,410
but uh,

804
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,161
so you got back together.

805
00:17:56,161 --> 00:17:56,880
We got back together.

806
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,713
That's nice.

807
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:58,910
Yeah.

808
00:17:58,910 --> 00:17:59,640
Course is great.

809
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:04,560
I remember running into her at a Satan
thing that the sate tannic fucking thing,

810
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,220
right?

811
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:05,530
Yeah.

812
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:06,840
Duncan Trussell,

813
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,970
my good friend was performing at,

814
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,660
uh,

815
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:14,660
is it Stanton [inaudible] grandson or
something like Anton liberties on the

816
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,030
Antis Branson and uh,

817
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:16,191
they,

818
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:21,191
they were getting married at this
fucking crazy theater and your wife was

819
00:18:21,661 --> 00:18:23,220
dressed as like a devil or some shit.

820
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,500
She was like dancing there.

821
00:18:25,501 --> 00:18:25,890
And I'm like,

822
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:26,011
oh,

823
00:18:26,011 --> 00:18:26,311
hi.

824
00:18:26,311 --> 00:18:26,791
How are you?

825
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:27,624
What are you doing here,

826
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:28,230
Carrie?

827
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,063
Normal person.

828
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,083
Why here?

829
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:30,601
But,

830
00:18:30,601 --> 00:18:30,870
uh,

831
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:31,200
the,

832
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,200
there's a picture of me with a Antala
Bay that knuckle heads to this day uses

833
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,280
evidence that I am a station.

834
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,150
Satan worshiper.

835
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,030
You're merely an associate.

836
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:44,431
Satan associate.

837
00:18:44,431 --> 00:18:45,450
I'm Satan to Jason's.

838
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:45,760
Yeah,

839
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,160
I think that's what they say now.

840
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:48,270
You know,

841
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,280
and that's fanboy.

842
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,360
I loved that.

843
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,200
That that's something people are,

844
00:18:52,201 --> 00:18:53,090
you still worry about it.

845
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:54,780
I'm a Satan family.

846
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,491
Oh my God.

847
00:18:56,491 --> 00:18:56,671
Yeah,

848
00:18:56,671 --> 00:18:57,260
that's good.

849
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,650
It's me and a,

850
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,660
I think that's a Hank Williams,

851
00:19:00,661 --> 00:19:02,710
the third shirt that I'm wearing there.

852
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:04,763
It's hard to tell.

853
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:05,770
That's the thing,

854
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:09,780
the fact that people still
worry about Satan is just,

855
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:11,850
you want to just say calm down.

856
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,530
He's not a problem.

857
00:19:13,531 --> 00:19:15,930
Cause he doesn't exist just like your God.

858
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:16,710
Oh,

859
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:17,461
they both air you.

860
00:19:17,461 --> 00:19:20,220
The people listening right now that just
took their earphones off and threw them

861
00:19:20,221 --> 00:19:21,054
across the room.

862
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,193
Well,

863
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,850
I can hear cut for 30
times you say to that.

864
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,613
Yeah,

865
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:33,150
just that you know whether or not
God exists is a fascinating point of

866
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:33,720
discussion.

867
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,890
But what's interesting is,

868
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:39,900
is this agreement that people say when
they decide that God exists and you

869
00:19:40,711 --> 00:19:42,210
decide that God exists and I decided to,

870
00:19:42,211 --> 00:19:42,750
God exists.

871
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:47,430
So we both have agreed that there's this
weird thing that makes no sense that

872
00:19:47,431 --> 00:19:48,480
we're on board with.

873
00:19:48,481 --> 00:19:50,880
So I know where you
stand on a lot of issues.

874
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:51,940
You know,

875
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,970
I probably know where
you stand on abortion.

876
00:19:53,971 --> 00:19:55,800
I probably know where you stand on guns.

877
00:19:55,801 --> 00:19:57,780
I probably know where you
stand on climate change.

878
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:01,590
It's like he gets so weird little
thing that you do when you say that,

879
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,341
you know when you say,

880
00:20:02,341 --> 00:20:02,800
well,

881
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,200
you know I'm a god fearing Christian.

882
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,063
Oh,

883
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:05,491
okay,

884
00:20:05,491 --> 00:20:05,671
no,

885
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:06,660
I can predict you better.

886
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:07,250
It's like,

887
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,400
I swear it's like you're off.

888
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:09,960
You're all wearing the same decoder ring.

889
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:10,710
Yes,

890
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,543
yes.

891
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,170
Well that is what a lot of it is.

892
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:15,900
A lot of it is whether or not
you believe in God or not.

893
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:21,180
It's the saying that God's real and the
worshiping God and the talking about

894
00:20:21,181 --> 00:20:21,810
God.

895
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:23,880
It's just letting everybody
know that they can predict.

896
00:20:23,881 --> 00:20:24,714
You know,

897
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,030
they know where you kind of
like if you're a gentleman,

898
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:27,721
if you're a gentleman,

899
00:20:27,721 --> 00:20:30,960
you wearing a tie with a nice
suit on and pair of pants,

900
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:36,140
I can fairly likely predict that
you're going to be reasonably behaved.

901
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:37,140
Yeah,

902
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:37,973
you're a gentlemen.

903
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:38,460
You know,

904
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,630
if you're a Christian,

905
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,930
if you're a person who calls
himself a Christian and you know,

906
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,140
well we go to the Bible,

907
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:45,840
go to church every Sunday and uh,

908
00:20:45,841 --> 00:20:47,710
I'd like to read the
Bible and I am a Christian

909
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,180
and people automatically go,

910
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:49,321
oh,

911
00:20:49,321 --> 00:20:49,691
okay.

912
00:20:49,691 --> 00:20:50,920
I kind of know where you're coming from.

913
00:20:50,921 --> 00:20:51,221
I can,

914
00:20:51,221 --> 00:20:52,390
I can see where you are.

915
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:55,600
And now I like that you can predict to me,

916
00:20:55,601 --> 00:20:57,940
cause you will like me better
so we don't have to talk.

917
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:58,510
Yes,

918
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:58,830
no.

919
00:20:58,830 --> 00:20:59,150
All right.

920
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,570
Now reinforce those,

921
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:02,140
those patterns in your head.

922
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,140
And I'll say some things that,

923
00:21:04,141 --> 00:21:04,360
uh,

924
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,960
I've repeated things that I've heard
other people say about God and Jesus and

925
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:09,610
yeah.

926
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:10,930
And it's a nice way to kill time.

927
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,190
It's not a bad way,

928
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:12,610
you know,

929
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:14,430
believing in God and
going to church and state,

930
00:21:14,431 --> 00:21:14,870
it's a great,

931
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:17,710
you killed time until death
nullifies all meaning.

932
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,041
Well,

933
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,440
I think the community
thing of it is a good day.

934
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,281
There's,

935
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:21,940
there's some,

936
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:26,860
there's some really powerful like bonding
experiences that people have when they

937
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,510
agreed to be humbled together.

938
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,200
Yeah.

939
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,590
You know,

940
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,670
you're describing curling,

941
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,111
curling,

942
00:21:32,111 --> 00:21:32,944
curling.

943
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,420
Another great look.

944
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:39,220
See Words in Canada are very popular.

945
00:21:39,221 --> 00:21:39,510
Countering,

946
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:39,900
curling.

947
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,180
Yup.

948
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:40,660
That's right.

949
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:43,330
And there's no way he's
curling is one of the top TV.

950
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,260
And you cannot rise to the tops of
curling without humbling yourself.

951
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,000
Cause you humble yourself
the minute you say,

952
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:52,660
I'm not like go curly when you pick up
that brush and a big smile on your face

953
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:53,931
side to sweep.

954
00:21:53,931 --> 00:21:54,090
I,

955
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:54,460
yeah,

956
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:54,971
I'm tried.

957
00:21:54,971 --> 00:21:55,481
Curling man.

958
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:56,080
It's not easy.

959
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:56,440
No,

960
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:56,960
it's hard.

961
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,270
Which still doesn't make it a sport.

962
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:02,050
I made fun of it in Newfoundland
and they fucking got so mad at me.

963
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,533
Wanna curling.

964
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:07,600
He'll read a theater where I was at like
how these pictures of curlers on the

965
00:22:07,601 --> 00:22:09,820
wall and I just could not
stop shitting on them yet.

966
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:10,580
We're like,

967
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,520
hey,

968
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,611
hey,

969
00:22:12,611 --> 00:22:14,050
there were legitimately upset.

970
00:22:14,051 --> 00:22:14,460
I'm like,

971
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,330
it is a preposterous endeavor.

972
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:16,630
Yeah.

973
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:17,101
You know in,

974
00:22:17,101 --> 00:22:17,591
and I know it,

975
00:22:17,591 --> 00:22:19,270
you're sliding a rock on the ice.

976
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:21,010
Used to be a reason to drink.

977
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,150
That's what curling was,

978
00:22:22,151 --> 00:22:23,130
where everybody would get together,

979
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:27,670
still is wasted and you don't fall very
far on the ice because we're already

980
00:22:27,671 --> 00:22:28,170
squatting.

981
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:28,381
Yeah,

982
00:22:28,381 --> 00:22:28,980
right.

983
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:29,170
Yeah.

984
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:31,150
And the other people are
leaning against brooms.

985
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:31,541
That's right.

986
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:32,560
You got a broom to lean against.

987
00:22:32,561 --> 00:22:33,940
It's great you're drinking.

988
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,650
It's also like when you fall on ice,

989
00:22:35,651 --> 00:22:36,700
it's almost always funny.

990
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:37,920
Always.

991
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,580
Yeah.

992
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:38,860
Yeah.

993
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:39,490
No one's,

994
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:41,440
no one ever catches himself.

995
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:41,880
No.

996
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,200
You don't like gently fall.

997
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:45,280
You could try and get up as good to you.

998
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:46,630
Don't fall elegantly on ice.

999
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,780
You can even go hiking and slip a
little and catch yourself in that.

1000
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:53,440
But even like when you're watching the
NHL and you'll see players that will just

1001
00:22:53,441 --> 00:22:54,100
fall down.

1002
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:54,480
Yeah.

1003
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,600
Like just for no reason.

1004
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:56,380
It's hilarious.

1005
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,820
These are the best skaters in the world,

1006
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,530
and they're just going
to fall down on his ass.

1007
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:01,100
He's a professional airplane.

1008
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:01,983
Yeah.

1009
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:02,891
Yeah.

1010
00:23:02,891 --> 00:23:05,590
And like if I ran with it Volkswagen,

1011
00:23:05,591 --> 00:23:06,670
I couldn't knock him over.

1012
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,450
Right.

1013
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:08,350
But he just fell.

1014
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,510
How long has curling been around?

1015
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,640
Hundreds old.

1016
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,670
It's a Scottish court.

1017
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:16,330
It's a Scottish spot where they used to
use actual rocks they'd find in fields

1018
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:18,050
and play it on frozen lakes.

1019
00:23:18,051 --> 00:23:18,670
The lakes,

1020
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:20,710
because that's the only
kind they have in Scotland.

1021
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:21,520
Yeah.

1022
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,120
Are frozen ones and the
lochness monster can around.

1023
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:26,050
There's a lot of,

1024
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:27,220
he's a wonderful curler.

1025
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,211
David,

1026
00:23:28,211 --> 00:23:28,871
are you Scottish?

1027
00:23:28,871 --> 00:23:29,800
I believe I'm from,

1028
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:30,011
yeah,

1029
00:23:30,011 --> 00:23:30,490
I've got,

1030
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:32,770
I got the part Scottish.

1031
00:23:32,771 --> 00:23:32,951
I mean,

1032
00:23:32,951 --> 00:23:34,900
there's a lot of Scottish
people in Canada,

1033
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,970
so you can see what
curling would be popular,

1034
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,060
you know,

1035
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:38,321
very,

1036
00:23:38,321 --> 00:23:39,640
very Scottish country Canada.

1037
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:40,503
It's strange.

1038
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:45,550
That's why there's so many gourds and
Craig's or it ain't that Johnson Gordon

1039
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,250
[inaudible].

1040
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:46,491
Yeah,

1041
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:47,001
that's right.

1042
00:23:47,001 --> 00:23:48,360
That would be a Scottish word,

1043
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:48,590
right?

1044
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,040
Yep.

1045
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,230
Gordon Gordon.

1046
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:51,080
Yeah,

1047
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,370
and of course because of Gordie Howe,

1048
00:23:52,371 --> 00:23:53,510
everyone named their kids.

1049
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,170
Gord.

1050
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:56,140
I went to school with a
guy named Greg [inaudible].

1051
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:57,380
I mean that was his first name.

1052
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:01,700
Greg or Greg or I know a guy named Greg
or Gregory Gillespie fights in the UFC

1053
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,673
animal.

1054
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:04,761
I haven't kind of,

1055
00:24:04,761 --> 00:24:05,594
Gregor,

1056
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:07,460
probably it's a savage.

1057
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:10,910
Can I just give one interesting
UFC memory for me please?

1058
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:15,950
I watched the very first UFC one a with,

1059
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:20,000
I had a trip at the time and we
invited scout troop and it wasn't,

1060
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:20,870
it was a comedy troupe,

1061
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,580
this boy scouts,

1062
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,890
but we invited Neil Patrick Harris over.

1063
00:24:24,891 --> 00:24:27,650
It was 20 years old at
the time he was in town.

1064
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:32,390
We just met him and he came over
and soon as the sumo wrestler,

1065
00:24:32,391 --> 00:24:35,660
God has face kicked in and
there's spit a tooth out,

1066
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,530
I believe.

1067
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:36,981
He was like,

1068
00:24:36,981 --> 00:24:37,790
I'm Outta here.

1069
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:38,600
I gotta get out.

1070
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,940
And we made him stay and
watch the whole thing.

1071
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:43,100
Good for you.

1072
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,300
And that's what made him gay.

1073
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:45,771
While that was,

1074
00:24:45,771 --> 00:24:46,970
thanks for ruining the story,

1075
00:24:46,971 --> 00:24:47,510
Dave.

1076
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,890
I don't know if that's true.

1077
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:49,810
I don't know if it works.

1078
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:50,643
Something happened,

1079
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,670
maybe someone dropped him on his head.

1080
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:53,583
Yeah.

1081
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,130
I don't think he knows.

1082
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:56,510
He looked like he was already as a kid,

1083
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:01,460
something went wrong or right.

1084
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,410
Depending on if you as boyfriend.

1085
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:04,020
Yeah.

1086
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,780
Imagine it depends if
he's a good boyfriend.

1087
00:25:05,781 --> 00:25:05,940
Right?

1088
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:06,440
Yeah.

1089
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:06,681
Well,

1090
00:25:06,681 --> 00:25:07,041
yes,

1091
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:09,140
but I mean if the husband,

1092
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,730
if the guy's really into him,

1093
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,200
thank God you watch that fight,

1094
00:25:12,201 --> 00:25:13,034
that time.

1095
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:14,390
God thank God.

1096
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:16,960
Otherwise could have
never found time chick.

1097
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:18,170
Yep.

1098
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:18,531
Who knows.

1099
00:25:18,531 --> 00:25:19,520
Look at Abby's and shit.

1100
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,413
Oh God.

1101
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:22,963
Yeah.

1102
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:26,660
So did you have to get remarried or did
you just pretend we never got divorced?

1103
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,960
Chrissy and I never got
around to getting divorced.

1104
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,380
Customer paperwork.

1105
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:31,070
Beautiful.

1106
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:31,520
Yeah.

1107
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,640
So we were separated.

1108
00:25:33,641 --> 00:25:33,920
We,

1109
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,360
we actually filed for divorce once,

1110
00:25:35,361 --> 00:25:36,980
but screwed up the paperwork for somehow.

1111
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:37,880
Is that true?

1112
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,480
Yeah.

1113
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,170
And then,

1114
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,003
uh,

1115
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:41,031
and then,

1116
00:25:41,031 --> 00:25:41,301
uh,

1117
00:25:41,301 --> 00:25:42,920
and then we just never
got around to it again.

1118
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,540
Just didn't fix it.

1119
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:45,374
And we now islet.

1120
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:45,681
Yeah.

1121
00:25:45,681 --> 00:25:46,090
I'm not,

1122
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:46,371
you know,

1123
00:25:46,371 --> 00:25:46,880
I'm not,

1124
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,200
I'm not good with organizing,

1125
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,000
so we just,

1126
00:25:50,001 --> 00:25:51,590
so we were just separated for,

1127
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:52,370
you know,

1128
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:53,060
it's funny because Chris,

1129
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,140
he's very organized.

1130
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:55,360
She is yet,

1131
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:56,630
it seems like maybe,

1132
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:57,771
maybe Jackie,

1133
00:25:57,771 --> 00:25:58,150
Jackie,

1134
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:59,690
she's the one who wasn't
willing to let go.

1135
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,030
You know,

1136
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:03,170
she was telling you something.

1137
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,073
Yeah,

1138
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,660
she was there early

1139
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:07,701
and that's what,

1140
00:26:07,701 --> 00:26:08,031
that's what,

1141
00:26:08,031 --> 00:26:08,241
yeah,

1142
00:26:08,241 --> 00:26:10,400
that's what guys will
be vacation with them.

1143
00:26:10,401 --> 00:26:11,840
When they were divorced,

1144
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,093
divorced.

1145
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:16,490
They would go as a together and
we get all our family trips.

1146
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:16,851
Did they,

1147
00:26:16,851 --> 00:26:18,890
did all family tree the
whole table together?

1148
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:21,170
Well the first two years we
weren't that we didn't do much.

1149
00:26:21,171 --> 00:26:21,351
No.

1150
00:26:21,351 --> 00:26:22,950
Those are the dark years.

1151
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:24,510
The dark.

1152
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,070
Yes.

1153
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:25,880
But then uh,

1154
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,061
yeah,

1155
00:26:26,061 --> 00:26:26,571
then yeah,

1156
00:26:26,571 --> 00:26:29,000
that's why we have kept me in
all of our family trips together.

1157
00:26:29,001 --> 00:26:29,870
We go to Hawaii.

1158
00:26:29,871 --> 00:26:30,740
It's like they were still married.

1159
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:31,820
Yeah.

1160
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:35,120
And so when we finally did get back
together it was really just so,

1161
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,700
it was mostly about the
convenience of our friends.

1162
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,440
It was just like,

1163
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,070
you know,

1164
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,900
this is going to make
everyone else's life easier.

1165
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:43,170
Really?

1166
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:43,381
Yeah.

1167
00:26:43,381 --> 00:26:43,831
Cause they don't,

1168
00:26:43,831 --> 00:26:44,640
you know

1169
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:44,790
what,

1170
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,020
we didn't have to go to two houses.

1171
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:47,250
Yeah.

1172
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,750
Which I hated.

1173
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,830
It's so Canadian of you.

1174
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,400
Yeah.

1175
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,200
So polite Canadian does.

1176
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:52,440
Yup.

1177
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,273
He's

1178
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,380
doesn't get divorced because the fly.

1179
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:56,730
How long,

1180
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:57,680
how long have you been married?

1181
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:58,740
10 years.

1182
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,573
And you,

1183
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,050
that's the only time
you've ever been married,

1184
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:01,640
right?

1185
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,610
Thank the baby Jesus.

1186
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,121
Oh my God.

1187
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:03,954
Yes.

1188
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:06,043
Praise Jesus.

1189
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,440
Done that.

1190
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,040
It's working.

1191
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:08,450
Yeah,

1192
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:08,740
it's,

1193
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,470
it's great.

1194
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:09,900
Yeah.

1195
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,070
Yeah.

1196
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:10,531
If it works,

1197
00:27:10,531 --> 00:27:11,250
it's great.

1198
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:11,420
Yeah.

1199
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:11,971
I always tell people,

1200
00:27:11,971 --> 00:27:12,510
don't do it.

1201
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,343
It's too risky.

1202
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,460
Yeah.

1203
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:14,850
You could.

1204
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:16,560
50% of the people don't make it.

1205
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:16,880
Yeah.

1206
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:16,991
It's,

1207
00:27:16,991 --> 00:27:17,250
it's uh,

1208
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:18,240
it's not a good,

1209
00:27:18,241 --> 00:27:20,730
a good rate of success.

1210
00:27:20,731 --> 00:27:24,600
Would you drive a car if you knew that
50% likely you would die in a crash,

1211
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,440
right?

1212
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,070
Yeah.

1213
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:26,311
I mean,

1214
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:29,340
it was an institution that made sense
when you're only going to live to be 40

1215
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:30,510
sweat.

1216
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:30,781
Well,

1217
00:27:30,781 --> 00:27:31,650
it makes sense.

1218
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,180
There's some parts of it that makes sense.

1219
00:27:33,181 --> 00:27:36,690
The problem is that it's become a business
and it's become a business for people

1220
00:27:36,691 --> 00:27:38,220
to try to squeeze is like,

1221
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,750
I'll never forget trying to talk,

1222
00:27:39,751 --> 00:27:41,070
fill in and getting divorced.

1223
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:41,850
Yeah.

1224
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:42,091
I go,

1225
00:27:42,091 --> 00:27:42,960
just give her half.

1226
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:43,770
And he goes,

1227
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:44,603
it's not half.

1228
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,570
It's two thirds.

1229
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:46,590
It's a scam.

1230
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,090
The fucking lawyers get a third.

1231
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:48,450
Yeah.

1232
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:52,320
He gave away two thirds and then he
was fucking freaking out about it.

1233
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:53,431
And it's true.

1234
00:27:53,431 --> 00:27:54,990
And he could've lived nicely on the third.

1235
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:56,130
He should have given her that.

1236
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:58,050
I don't think that,

1237
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:58,530
I mean,

1238
00:27:58,530 --> 00:27:59,790
the word was that,

1239
00:27:59,791 --> 00:28:01,020
that's why she killed him,

1240
00:28:01,021 --> 00:28:02,070
that he was leaving,

1241
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:02,941
that that was,

1242
00:28:02,941 --> 00:28:04,530
he was finally leaving,

1243
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,240
and then that's when she killed him.

1244
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,360
But when we were together with him,

1245
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:14,340
there was always days where he would
come to the set and just be just in hell.

1246
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,121
Oh yeah.

1247
00:28:15,121 --> 00:28:15,750
Well,

1248
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:15,991
yeah.

1249
00:28:15,991 --> 00:28:16,920
And he wouldn't well be,

1250
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:21,210
he'd just be on the floor of
the studio and like ranting.

1251
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:21,600
Yeah.

1252
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,020
About,

1253
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:22,381
about,

1254
00:28:22,381 --> 00:28:22,960
you know,

1255
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,200
I'm living in my boat
and he lived in his boat.

1256
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:27,181
It was rough,

1257
00:28:27,181 --> 00:28:28,014
man.

1258
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,180
And then he would come back
like a day later and it'd be,

1259
00:28:30,181 --> 00:28:30,271
well,

1260
00:28:30,271 --> 00:28:32,550
I'm back together with my blushing bride.

1261
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:33,870
That's exact quote.

1262
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:34,590
Yep.

1263
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:36,620
And we can the exact quote
and we'd all just be going,

1264
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:38,730
oh yeah,

1265
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:39,760
it was poor bastard.

1266
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,800
Although none of the weird thing of news,

1267
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:42,991
right.

1268
00:28:42,991 --> 00:28:44,640
There was not one good
marriage on the show.

1269
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,420
You know,

1270
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:48,090
like everyone was going through
a terrible marriage at the time.

1271
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:52,440
Like I was proud that it was one
person who wasn't on antidepressants.

1272
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,520
Super psyched about that.

1273
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,880
I wasn't on any pills
and I wasn't in therapy,

1274
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,200
but I probably needed it.

1275
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:00,963
I think we all did.

1276
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:01,650
Yeah.

1277
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:02,130
But yeah,

1278
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:03,210
I mean I remember you started with,

1279
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:07,200
I can just this second season we came
back and Steve Route had gotten divorced

1280
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:08,610
and he was the first one.

1281
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:10,020
I mean,

1282
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:14,620
I think everyone free to be me or
Phil would get divorced for us.

1283
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,480
Steven Mora.

1284
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:17,640
But Steve,

1285
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,090
yeah.

1286
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,620
We didn't know how bad it was for Steve.

1287
00:29:19,621 --> 00:29:21,030
I guess it's hard up there.

1288
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:24,580
Tarred Todd to make it hard,

1289
00:29:24,581 --> 00:29:26,010
hard for people sit together.

1290
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:27,030
It'd be nice to each other.

1291
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:27,840
Yeah,

1292
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,673
yeah,

1293
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,310
yeah.

1294
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:29,701
It takes,

1295
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:30,960
does they say it takes work,

1296
00:29:30,961 --> 00:29:32,070
but it actually takes work.

1297
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:32,640
Yeah,

1298
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,450
it does take work.

1299
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:36,160
Your way to wait until you
are an adult too is good.

1300
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:36,920
Good move.

1301
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,530
Yeah.

1302
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:39,420
Most people get married
before they're adults.

1303
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:39,661
Yeah.

1304
00:29:39,661 --> 00:29:41,620
I think you should wait until
you know who the fuck you are.

1305
00:29:41,621 --> 00:29:42,101
And it's still,

1306
00:29:42,101 --> 00:29:42,970
I'm still guessing.

1307
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:43,630
Yeah.

1308
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:44,321
Even to this day,

1309
00:29:44,321 --> 00:29:45,220
I'm guessing who I am.

1310
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:50,290
Literally my dad almost on his
death bed told me don't do it.

1311
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,290
You can't get married until
you're 30 that's a good move.

1312
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,540
It's demanded that he,

1313
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,653
I didn't,

1314
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,810
I haven't got married
at 30 but he was like,

1315
00:29:58,811 --> 00:29:59,644
don't do it.

1316
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:02,620
Don't do it before 30 cause
you don't know who you are.

1317
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:04,510
You don't know what's going on.

1318
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:07,210
Well that I've seen too
many predatory marriages.

1319
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,610
I've seen women marry men
that don't really like,

1320
00:30:09,611 --> 00:30:10,870
because they know the man has money.

1321
00:30:10,871 --> 00:30:11,704
And I've seen,

1322
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,150
I've seen the opposite.

1323
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:18,070
It's just such a weird thing when you
enter into contractual agreement about

1324
00:30:18,071 --> 00:30:18,904
romance.

1325
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:19,631
Like it's,

1326
00:30:19,631 --> 00:30:19,920
it's,

1327
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,120
it's not just I love you,

1328
00:30:22,121 --> 00:30:22,811
you love me,

1329
00:30:22,811 --> 00:30:23,410
let's,

1330
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:27,040
let's have a celebration of our love and
let's invite our friends over and tell

1331
00:30:27,041 --> 00:30:27,874
everybody we've,

1332
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:32,940
we've decided to engage each other
in this very special commitment.

1333
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:35,320
But then you start bringing in lawyers.

1334
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:36,340
Yeah.

1335
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:36,790
Right.

1336
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:37,960
And then it gets weird.

1337
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:38,561
And then you know,

1338
00:30:38,561 --> 00:30:43,561
you have weird state by state laws
where there's common law marriages.

1339
00:30:45,251 --> 00:30:47,380
If you live with someone for 10 years,

1340
00:30:47,381 --> 00:30:51,160
and that might've been where humanity
went wrong was when the first guys said,

1341
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:52,810
I wouldn't be a lawyer.

1342
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:55,390
Like that was his decision.

1343
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,890
I'm looking around and to think,

1344
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:57,843
yeah,

1345
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:59,470
there's a lot of ugliness in the world.

1346
00:30:59,710 --> 00:30:59,861
Yeah.

1347
00:30:59,861 --> 00:31:00,990
What was the work on?

1348
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,900
It was the first lawyer like was the,

1349
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,330
there's a series of laws,

1350
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:04,751
right?

1351
00:31:04,751 --> 00:31:06,250
The first lawyers had
to have been priests,

1352
00:31:06,251 --> 00:31:07,084
right?

1353
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:07,751
I would guess so.

1354
00:31:07,751 --> 00:31:08,200
Yeah.

1355
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,620
I mean the law is a
Ferris initially we're,

1356
00:31:10,621 --> 00:31:11,800
we're basically lawyers,

1357
00:31:11,801 --> 00:31:12,490
right.

1358
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:13,323
What does a Pharisee,

1359
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:13,990
the Jewish,

1360
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:16,780
the Jewish priests makes sense.

1361
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:18,160
That does make a lot of sense.

1362
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,023
Yeah.

1363
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:20,920
A lot of my relatives.

1364
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:22,030
Yeah.

1365
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:22,181
Yeah.

1366
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:27,160
Like when did it become a thing where
it was you would go to law school and it

1367
00:31:27,161 --> 00:31:27,600
was,

1368
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,210
uh,

1369
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:33,040
a respectable occupation and it
would be good to know a good lawyer.

1370
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:34,203
Yeah.

1371
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,720
I think those things started out as not
respectable and people did them cause

1372
00:31:41,111 --> 00:31:44,170
they didn't have any other like choice.

1373
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,310
And again,

1374
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,960
they realized all their
making all the money,

1375
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,423
you know,

1376
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,930
and then it became respectable.

1377
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:50,430
Well,

1378
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:55,430
once they figured out there's all those
legal ease and loopholes in the system

1379
00:31:55,601 --> 00:31:57,250
is ways to extract money.

1380
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:57,680
Yeah.

1381
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:01,480
You just gotta be weasley about it and
then they invent a whole language to

1382
00:32:01,481 --> 00:32:03,310
exclude anyone else from understanding it.

1383
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:03,970
Yeah.

1384
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:05,620
Do you think they billed hourly back then?

1385
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:06,933
Still?

1386
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:07,271
Yeah.

1387
00:32:07,271 --> 00:32:07,871
But then again,

1388
00:32:07,871 --> 00:32:09,250
time hadn't been codified,

1389
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:09,761
so,

1390
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,050
so what did they built by an hour?

1391
00:32:11,051 --> 00:32:13,150
It was basically decided
by community standards.

1392
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,110
You know,

1393
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,430
when was time codified?

1394
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:15,970
Uh,

1395
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:17,080
when the railroads came in.

1396
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,533
True.

1397
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:20,830
Well that's when,

1398
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,240
that's when time zones were created.

1399
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:24,700
The time zones were
created by the railroads.

1400
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:25,090
Really.

1401
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:27,610
Everybody's on a different
time zone and every town,

1402
00:32:27,611 --> 00:32:29,170
every town said its own time.

1403
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:30,250
Like wow.

1404
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:30,851
Like you could have,

1405
00:32:30,851 --> 00:32:31,684
you could drive,

1406
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:33,330
you could drive from like,

1407
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:34,000
uh,

1408
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,330
from Denver to Fort Collins and the two
cities would be completely different

1409
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:38,080
times.

1410
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:38,710
Wow.

1411
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:41,240
And how you sync up your
watch with the town clock?

1412
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:41,720
Yeah.

1413
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,100
You have the clock in the main
square and that'll be all the time.

1414
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:44,950
That's the time.

1415
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:47,180
But when they started having
to schedule railroads,

1416
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:47,961
they realized,

1417
00:32:47,961 --> 00:32:48,500
well,

1418
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:48,771
Huh,

1419
00:32:48,771 --> 00:32:49,490
all these towns.

1420
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:54,290
And then they started
having huge competitions to
invent ways of synchronizing

1421
00:32:54,291 --> 00:32:56,620
clocks between cities and that,

1422
00:32:56,621 --> 00:32:59,210
did they use a sun dial to
get the initial reading?

1423
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:04,400
I think it really was just a simple as
we'll call this midnight or we'll call

1424
00:33:04,821 --> 00:33:05,610
this noon,

1425
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:05,971
you know,

1426
00:33:05,971 --> 00:33:09,260
and then he just went from there and
none of the clocks were that accurate.

1427
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,970
So time would shift over time.

1428
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:11,901
So,

1429
00:33:11,901 --> 00:33:12,141
uh,

1430
00:33:12,141 --> 00:33:12,974
it became,

1431
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:18,240
that was like in like the 19th century
was a huge move to try and find a way to

1432
00:33:18,441 --> 00:33:19,610
synchronize clocks.

1433
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,533
And that drove,

1434
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,630
kind of drove a lot of the
beginnings of technology.

1435
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:27,170
Do you remember when you were a kid you
would call phone number to get the time?

1436
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:30,140
Always say yes for sure the exact time.

1437
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:31,430
The weather as well sometimes.

1438
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:32,503
But the time,

1439
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:37,750
the time is exactly
four 59 and 35 seconds.

1440
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,090
Well,

1441
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:43,090
and in Canada at one o'clock every day
they had the national time tone right at

1442
00:33:45,411 --> 00:33:48,400
this essential and of the long
beep it will be exactly one PR,

1443
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,253
radio and TV.

1444
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,300
Why 1:00 PM?

1445
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:51,283
I don't know why,

1446
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:52,491
but it has.

1447
00:33:52,491 --> 00:33:54,080
When they would do it
at 1:00 PM every day,

1448
00:33:54,081 --> 00:33:54,930
the CBC would,

1449
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,360
would broadcast a tone

1450
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:59,510
and that was the time
for the whole country.

1451
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:00,860
Wow.

1452
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:04,700
I never would've guessed that time
zones are created by the railroads.

1453
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:05,060
Yeah,

1454
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,290
but it totally makes sense.

1455
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:07,520
Have a schedule without,

1456
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:08,563
yeah.

1457
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,300
Because before that nobody went anywhere.

1458
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:11,811
You know,

1459
00:34:11,811 --> 00:34:14,360
Arizona's still doesn't
do daylight savings time.

1460
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:15,561
They're like,

1461
00:34:15,561 --> 00:34:16,580
fuck you.

1462
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,713
That's stupid.

1463
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,553
They're allowed to do that.

1464
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,010
Yup.

1465
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:19,520
Yup.

1466
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,030
Yup.

1467
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:20,540
Wow.

1468
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:24,290
If you drive from like if you
drive from Nevada to Arizona,

1469
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,131
you're,

1470
00:34:25,131 --> 00:34:25,431
you're,

1471
00:34:25,431 --> 00:34:26,330
you miss an hour.

1472
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:26,780
Yeah.

1473
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:27,021
The act.

1474
00:34:27,021 --> 00:34:27,531
The only state.

1475
00:34:27,531 --> 00:34:28,790
Isn't there another state that doesn't,

1476
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:29,380
I wonder,

1477
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,470
I think no one I'm aware of.

1478
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,110
Is there a wide why Hawaii?

1479
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,080
They're an island.

1480
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:37,460
We stole Hawaii.

1481
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:37,640
Yeah,

1482
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,450
that's right.

1483
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:40,100
Doesn't that island is theirs.

1484
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:40,341
Yeah.

1485
00:34:40,341 --> 00:34:40,671
That's a,

1486
00:34:40,671 --> 00:34:43,730
that's a fucking country
that we occupy with hotels.

1487
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:46,460
It's own feeling.

1488
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:48,080
The rest of it was given to us by God.

1489
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:48,871
Yes,

1490
00:34:48,871 --> 00:34:49,191
that's true.

1491
00:34:49,191 --> 00:34:50,090
It's manifest destiny.

1492
00:34:50,091 --> 00:34:50,400
Correct?

1493
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:50,780
Yes.

1494
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,613
The rest of it,

1495
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:52,580
but not Hawaii.

1496
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:52,940
No.

1497
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:53,900
Cause that came less late.

1498
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:54,900
It was late.

1499
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:55,161
The game.

1500
00:34:55,161 --> 00:35:00,161
There's no single co like there's no
state where the people are so clearly like

1501
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:03,830
their ethnicity is so clearly defined.

1502
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:06,670
They're Polynesian
looking at both the lay,

1503
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:08,790
their culture,

1504
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:12,210
North Dakota or fucking
Florida or some shit.

1505
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:16,070
It's like they're not from
the European heritage.

1506
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:16,490
No.

1507
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:16,641
Yeah,

1508
00:35:16,641 --> 00:35:16,881
there's,

1509
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:17,061
you know,

1510
00:35:17,061 --> 00:35:21,500
there's an interesting debate going on
about what is ne or California moves

1511
00:35:21,501 --> 00:35:23,120
towards permanent daylight savings time.

1512
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:24,873
It's not your land

1513
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:27,831
every day.

1514
00:35:27,831 --> 00:35:30,140
We get to get up an hour early every day.

1515
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,410
Earlier and earlier and
earlier and earlier.

1516
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,680
I already of Arizona's on permanent
standard time and the year lown daylight

1517
00:35:37,681 --> 00:35:41,220
savings times followed by Hawaiian and
the territories of the American Samoa.

1518
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:41,701
Oh,

1519
00:35:41,701 --> 00:35:44,700
Guam and minor outlying islands.

1520
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:46,670
While I say California,

1521
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:51,720
let's be really bold and go for permanent
daylight look like a white Alaska,

1522
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,311
Alaska.

1523
00:35:53,311 --> 00:35:53,911
Exactly.

1524
00:35:53,911 --> 00:35:54,260
Yeah,

1525
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:54,770
yeah.

1526
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:55,950
It's just give up on night.

1527
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:56,731
Well,

1528
00:35:56,731 --> 00:35:59,430
and then just everybody wants to kill
themselves when it's nighttime there.

1529
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:03,870
There's an interesting debate going on
in Hawaii right now as to what is an

1530
00:36:03,871 --> 00:36:08,871
invasive species because so much of the
wildlife in Hawaii was brought over and

1531
00:36:11,881 --> 00:36:12,691
so there's,

1532
00:36:12,691 --> 00:36:16,170
there's some debate on certain islands
where they want to eliminate the wild

1533
00:36:16,171 --> 00:36:20,310
pigs because they say they're an
invasive species and then the people are

1534
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:20,551
saying,

1535
00:36:20,551 --> 00:36:25,260
but we'll hold on because we kind of
came after a lot of these wild pigs.

1536
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:28,200
Like a lot of the wild pigs
were dropped off by pirates,

1537
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,590
like carrots and,

1538
00:36:29,591 --> 00:36:33,780
and people that were in a boating like
that were traveling by boat across the

1539
00:36:33,781 --> 00:36:34,110
world.

1540
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:37,260
They would drop off goats
and pigs on various islands,

1541
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:40,920
so they would have something to hunt when
they would come back for food because

1542
00:36:40,921 --> 00:36:43,140
they knew that this would
be a stop along their route,

1543
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:44,963
which is clever.

1544
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,193
It is clever.

1545
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:47,700
It ruined a lot of islands,

1546
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:48,680
especially the goats.

1547
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,090
Yeah.

1548
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:50,310
Destroyed a lot of islands.

1549
00:36:50,311 --> 00:36:50,880
I just ate it.

1550
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,030
And now in Hawaii there's
a lot of mongoose.

1551
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:54,960
Oh really?

1552
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,111
Yeah.

1553
00:36:55,111 --> 00:36:57,050
They brought Mongoose and at
some point I forget what it was,

1554
00:36:57,051 --> 00:36:57,271
was,

1555
00:36:57,271 --> 00:36:59,030
was to control the rabbit population.

1556
00:36:59,031 --> 00:36:59,851
That was probably where the rats,

1557
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:02,010
I think it was to control that
as they came in from again,

1558
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:04,450
from shipping and then the
mongoose probably starting another.

1559
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:04,980
Anything else?

1560
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:05,761
Just all over the place.

1561
00:37:05,761 --> 00:37:06,120
Yeah.

1562
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:11,120
Mongoose animals under the Alaska
holiday and I made a joke about,

1563
00:37:11,611 --> 00:37:11,941
you know,

1564
00:37:11,941 --> 00:37:14,520
I'm looking for beavers cause I didn't
think there were beavers in Alaska

1565
00:37:14,521 --> 00:37:15,210
because it's too cold.

1566
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:18,450
They said no last 10 years we've got
tons of beavers here cause of global

1567
00:37:18,451 --> 00:37:19,160
warming.

1568
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,220
Reelers everywhere.

1569
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:20,670
Yeah,

1570
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:21,503
they're moving.

1571
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,520
Beavers are migrating north.

1572
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,120
Yeah.

1573
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:27,570
Alaska is a fascinating place that
you could go there for the summer.

1574
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:28,801
You go there in the summer,

1575
00:37:28,801 --> 00:37:31,980
you have never seen more
aggressive mosquitoes.

1576
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:36,660
It's like they know they only have two
months to live and so you get out of your

1577
00:37:36,661 --> 00:37:37,021
car,

1578
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:37,920
they swarm,

1579
00:37:37,921 --> 00:37:38,940
you look a cloud.

1580
00:37:38,941 --> 00:37:39,721
It's crazy.

1581
00:37:39,721 --> 00:37:41,340
I've never seen anything
like it in my life.

1582
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,320
You would think tropical weather,

1583
00:37:43,321 --> 00:37:44,160
that's where the mosquitoes.

1584
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:44,550
Yeah.

1585
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:45,690
No Alaska.

1586
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,450
They're fucking ferocious
and they're huge.

1587
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:49,110
Yeah.

1588
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:49,381
Yeah.

1589
00:37:49,381 --> 00:37:50,730
I've never actually going to go there.

1590
00:37:50,731 --> 00:37:51,870
And then in November I think.

1591
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:52,261
Oh yeah.

1592
00:37:52,261 --> 00:37:55,230
What are you doing during
the touring with a,

1593
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,310
whose life anyway?

1594
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,600
It's like an Improv tour.

1595
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:00,660
So who's live anyway?

1596
00:38:00,661 --> 00:38:01,760
Like a takeoff shoot.

1597
00:38:01,761 --> 00:38:03,150
Who's line is it anyway?

1598
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:07,190
It's like Greg Proops and Jeff
Daniels from that show and a,

1599
00:38:07,191 --> 00:38:07,371
yeah.

1600
00:38:07,371 --> 00:38:09,050
So Greg and Geoff and Jo Marie.

1601
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:09,350
Oh,

1602
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:09,950
okay.

1603
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:10,300
Cool.

1604
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:10,950
And me,

1605
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:11,681
I guess Joe,

1606
00:38:11,681 --> 00:38:12,151
Mary's Bill.

1607
00:38:12,151 --> 00:38:12,721
Murray's brother,

1608
00:38:12,721 --> 00:38:12,930
right?

1609
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:13,200
Yeah.

1610
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:13,860
Yeah.

1611
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,000
So it's like a rotating,

1612
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:15,540
uh,

1613
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,560
so those three guys at the core,

1614
00:38:16,561 --> 00:38:17,250
and then there's a,

1615
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:17,790
uh,

1616
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:19,380
Ryan stiles myself,

1617
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,300
drew Carey and uh,

1618
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,820
and chip esten sort of rotate through,

1619
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:24,780
likes it.

1620
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,360
The tour to carry might be the
nicest person that's ever lived.

1621
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,380
I don't know him well.

1622
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,790
He might be the nicest guy ever.

1623
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,320
And it's nice he,

1624
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:32,621
yeah,

1625
00:38:32,621 --> 00:38:35,280
I remember it was the drew Carey show
that finally got Newsradio canceled,

1626
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:36,913
Huh?

1627
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:37,720
Nope.

1628
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:37,990
No,

1629
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:39,470
remember we did a whole year after that,

1630
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,050
but I think that was what it was.

1631
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:43,420
I don't think they wanted
to do it anymore after that,

1632
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:45,880
but I think our waiters
are ratings tanked when we,

1633
00:38:45,881 --> 00:38:48,850
when they put us up against true
care or ratings are always shit.

1634
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:49,240
Yeah.

1635
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,850
That's the most amazing thing is
that the ratings were really great.

1636
00:38:51,851 --> 00:38:54,010
Once we got canceled
and then it was on TV,

1637
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,810
like they would show the reruns.

1638
00:38:55,811 --> 00:38:56,201
So people go,

1639
00:38:56,201 --> 00:38:56,291
oh,

1640
00:38:56,291 --> 00:38:57,200
this is a funny show.

1641
00:38:57,201 --> 00:38:57,520
They,

1642
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,120
they found it.

1643
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:58,720
It's true.

1644
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,010
I remember Lou Morton,

1645
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:00,311
uh,

1646
00:39:00,311 --> 00:39:02,740
one of our writers showing
up at the huge show,

1647
00:39:02,741 --> 00:39:07,060
but the read table read the different
number on his shirt every week when we

1648
00:39:07,061 --> 00:39:08,950
were in the real shit or
when we're falling apart.

1649
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,480
The lowest number nine,

1650
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:12,790
eight out of a hundred shows,

1651
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:14,360
eight was one day,

1652
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,273
no bullshit.

1653
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:15,821
I go,

1654
00:39:15,821 --> 00:39:16,451
is that real?

1655
00:39:16,451 --> 00:39:16,811
He's like,

1656
00:39:16,811 --> 00:39:17,120
yeah,

1657
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,280
like have the shirt made?

1658
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:18,780
Yeah.

1659
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:19,060
Yeah.

1660
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:19,241
No,

1661
00:39:19,241 --> 00:39:20,380
you would draw it basically.

1662
00:39:20,381 --> 00:39:21,850
It basically a sweatshirt
with a marker on it.

1663
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:25,120
That's hilarious that he would just
show up with this fucking number on his

1664
00:39:25,121 --> 00:39:25,811
shirt and I was like,

1665
00:39:25,811 --> 00:39:26,610
hey.

1666
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:26,951
He's like,

1667
00:39:26,951 --> 00:39:27,091
yeah,

1668
00:39:27,091 --> 00:39:30,490
it's a source of pride when
you can still be hanging on.

1669
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:33,520
One year that I thought we weren't going
to get canceled was the year we got

1670
00:39:33,521 --> 00:39:34,090
canceled.

1671
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:34,481
I was like,

1672
00:39:34,481 --> 00:39:34,781
well,

1673
00:39:34,781 --> 00:39:35,614
we're doing pretty good.

1674
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:36,040
Yeah.

1675
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:36,910
Well actually I have a ratings.

1676
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:37,930
We're all right.

1677
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:38,560
Yeah,

1678
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,380
it's a five year show.

1679
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,213
Right.

1680
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:42,910
But much like the whole,

1681
00:39:42,911 --> 00:39:45,250
like we never really
hit a hundred episodes.

1682
00:39:45,251 --> 00:39:49,060
We got to like 97 97
because NBC didn't own it.

1683
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:51,820
So they did that with a bunch
of shows they didn't own.

1684
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:53,200
They do that on purpose for a year,

1685
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:56,410
but four or five shows they
cancelled at 97 episodes.

1686
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:57,071
Really?

1687
00:39:57,071 --> 00:39:57,880
Yeah.

1688
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,361
Cause they,

1689
00:39:58,361 --> 00:39:59,070
cause there's,

1690
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,820
it's a hundred it goes into syndication.

1691
00:40:00,821 --> 00:40:01,291
Is that right?

1692
00:40:01,291 --> 00:40:02,124
It used to be the rule.

1693
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:02,983
Yeah.

1694
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,510
But now syndication,

1695
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,190
anything doesn't really exist anymore.

1696
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:09,880
Well the weirdest one was the Charlie
Sheen model that they did with that anger

1697
00:40:09,881 --> 00:40:13,300
management show where they divided
the whole new system 10 yeah.

1698
00:40:13,301 --> 00:40:15,640
If the first couple
episodes do well fuck it,

1699
00:40:15,641 --> 00:40:18,850
we order a hundred and they
produced them all in the year.

1700
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,300
Yes.

1701
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,280
They just saw mashed them together.

1702
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:21,940
They just,

1703
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:24,490
they wrote it within five
minutes and started filming,

1704
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,560
filming and writing on the fly.

1705
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:27,700
Everything was dog shit.

1706
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:30,520
And they shot like four episodes a week.

1707
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,170
They paid Charlie in cracks.

1708
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:33,880
Yeah.

1709
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,270
Yeah.

1710
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:36,340
Thousands of dollars with
a crack and do his account.

1711
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:37,803
Yeah.

1712
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:41,050
They had one of those old timey ice guys
that you still have her ice delivered

1713
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:43,830
the crack thing to his door cause you,

1714
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:44,861
cause here's the thing,

1715
00:40:44,861 --> 00:40:45,550
they have themselves.

1716
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:47,560
You can't get crack out
of an ATM machine yet.

1717
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,310
No,

1718
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:48,960
not anymore.

1719
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,530
And you can get pot out of one now.

1720
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:50,820
Yeah.

1721
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,210
You can get pot out of a dispensary.

1722
00:40:52,211 --> 00:40:52,471
Michigan,

1723
00:40:52,471 --> 00:40:52,961
California.

1724
00:40:52,961 --> 00:40:53,794
That's good.

1725
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:54,071
Yeah.

1726
00:40:54,071 --> 00:40:55,570
Well I don't know where we'll see.

1727
00:40:55,571 --> 00:40:56,404
We'll find out.

1728
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:57,090
But there's,

1729
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:57,340
there's,

1730
00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:00,820
they do have marijuana
dispensary machines.

1731
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:01,400
Yeah.

1732
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,120
Yeah.

1733
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:06,040
You must have to like show
some sort of a proof of age.

1734
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,300
But I guess if you just have your,

1735
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:08,770
if you have a passport,

1736
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:11,140
a passport or a driver's license,

1737
00:41:11,141 --> 00:41:12,700
like if you could read a passport,

1738
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,890
they have a machine that reads
a passport at the airport.

1739
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,060
You know when you go through,

1740
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,720
if you have like um,

1741
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,270
global entry,

1742
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,180
they got the face recognition
thing until I got the clear.

1743
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:22,511
Yeah,

1744
00:41:22,511 --> 00:41:24,130
I got that fingerprint one.

1745
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:25,203
That's nice too.

1746
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:25,990
Yeah.

1747
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:27,230
Glover entries the best dog.

1748
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:28,810
You don't have to fuck
with that giant lawn.

1749
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:29,600
Yeah.

1750
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,490
Just shit ain't got that.

1751
00:41:30,491 --> 00:41:34,460
I got this stupid Tsa global entry is
great because it comes with TSA pre.

1752
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:34,700
Yeah.

1753
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,450
I get the Tsa and they get the clear ad.

1754
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,293
It makes me mad.

1755
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:42,020
The ultimate Combo is Tsa pre and clear.

1756
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:42,560
Yeah.

1757
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,330
Cause they just do the fingerprints.

1758
00:41:44,331 --> 00:41:44,751
Boom.

1759
00:41:44,751 --> 00:41:46,250
And then they'd push
it right into the line.

1760
00:41:46,251 --> 00:41:49,340
Sounded like venereal disease
and nice people walk you.

1761
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:50,780
They walk you all the way.

1762
00:41:50,781 --> 00:41:51,614
10 clear,

1763
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,530
clear not to pit Tsa pre with clear,

1764
00:41:54,531 --> 00:41:56,630
the nice people walk you
all the way over to the,

1765
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:58,580
but yeah,

1766
00:41:58,780 --> 00:41:59,570
you can't,

1767
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:02,300
the person you have the option of
actually pissing on the people that you're

1768
00:42:02,301 --> 00:42:05,110
passing on their feet because
they don't have any shoes on.

1769
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:05,511
My God,

1770
00:42:05,511 --> 00:42:06,231
I have to get this.

1771
00:42:06,231 --> 00:42:07,064
Yeah,

1772
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,090
that sounds fantastic.

1773
00:42:08,091 --> 00:42:08,924
I'm going to get that.

1774
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:09,350
But then it,

1775
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:09,890
yeah,

1776
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:10,760
I'm gonna go out to the company.

1777
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:11,301
You have to travel.

1778
00:42:11,301 --> 00:42:12,660
So no,

1779
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:13,310
not much.

1780
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:14,031
I mean to Canada,

1781
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:14,781
but that doesn't really matter.

1782
00:42:14,781 --> 00:42:15,614
It's something country.

1783
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:16,280
Yeah.

1784
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:16,491
Yeah.

1785
00:42:16,491 --> 00:42:17,660
We will still in this country.

1786
00:42:17,661 --> 00:42:18,020
Yeah.

1787
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:20,750
Well you could always go through
through the woods you had to Canada.

1788
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:21,500
It's true.

1789
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:25,670
People who taught border the border is a
hundred a hundred yard clearcut is most

1790
00:42:25,671 --> 00:42:28,610
of the border with Canada is just a
hundred yard clearcut and in the forest.

1791
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:30,110
So it's,

1792
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:32,690
it's actually cut cutting the trees down.

1793
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:37,220
It's like a hundred yards wide
and that's the border all across.

1794
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,180
It's not from what entity?

1795
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,153
Natalie's it,

1796
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,710
it's actually easier to cross the
border then the surrounding area.

1797
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:43,071
Yeah.

1798
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,160
Because the surrounding areas though.

1799
00:42:44,161 --> 00:42:44,540
Forest.

1800
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:44,840
Yeah.

1801
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,021
No.

1802
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:45,530
Do they,

1803
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:47,600
do they actually maintained that cut?

1804
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:48,100
Yeah.

1805
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:48,330
Yeah.

1806
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:48,770
Really.

1807
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:53,390
So every year someone's job is to cut
down the trees for a hundred yard space

1808
00:42:53,391 --> 00:42:54,680
between the United States and Canada.

1809
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:55,120
Yeah.

1810
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,320
Why is most of the Canadian
border just still that?

1811
00:42:57,321 --> 00:42:57,890
You know,

1812
00:42:57,890 --> 00:42:59,510
if you're a criminal and you cross here,

1813
00:42:59,511 --> 00:43:00,830
additional charges will apply.

1814
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:01,340
Yeah.

1815
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:02,690
Cause now you've fled the country.

1816
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:02,871
Well,

1817
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:03,590
have you ever seen the,

1818
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:04,490
you've seen the footage of,

1819
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:09,350
of refugees coming into Canada and the
mounties meeting them and they were like,

1820
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:10,221
the mounties are just,

1821
00:43:10,221 --> 00:43:13,460
they're going now you understand that
when you cross over here we will be

1822
00:43:13,461 --> 00:43:14,420
arresting you.

1823
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:16,110
There is look at the best of life.

1824
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,210
Wow.

1825
00:43:17,211 --> 00:43:18,410
That's crazy.

1826
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:20,770
The 49th parallel,

1827
00:43:20,771 --> 00:43:21,310
it says,

1828
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:22,070
yeah.

1829
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:22,970
Wow,

1830
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,830
that's fucking crazy.

1831
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,030
I bet that's a,

1832
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:28,970
you need to passports to
watch the there there America,

1833
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:32,480
there's where your terror should
last the opposite of a wall.

1834
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:32,990
Yeah.

1835
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:34,960
That's an actual welcoming pants actually.

1836
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:35,360
Yeah.

1837
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,250
That shows how much we like Canada.

1838
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:37,820
Yeah.

1839
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:39,260
Or how little you think about it.

1840
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:40,910
Make it easier to cross.

1841
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,210
We'll make it really super easy.

1842
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:46,820
It's easier than the 100 yard stretch.

1843
00:43:46,821 --> 00:43:47,150
It's like,

1844
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:47,690
ah,

1845
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:49,790
don't trip a really relax yourself.

1846
00:43:49,791 --> 00:43:51,200
You're about to hit paradise.

1847
00:43:51,201 --> 00:43:51,740
And most,

1848
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:53,990
most of the visa overstays or Canadian,

1849
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:58,280
which is the bulk of illegal
immigration in America,

1850
00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:00,080
is Canadians overstaying their visas.

1851
00:44:00,081 --> 00:44:00,500
Right.

1852
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:01,070
I've done that.

1853
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:01,281
Yeah.

1854
00:44:01,281 --> 00:44:02,330
It's a giant part of it,

1855
00:44:02,331 --> 00:44:02,630
right?

1856
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:02,901
I mean,

1857
00:44:02,901 --> 00:44:05,120
we all overstay our welcome
call British folks too.

1858
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:05,780
Definitely.

1859
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:06,220
Yeah.

1860
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:07,053
Yeah.

1861
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:08,210
But no one cares.

1862
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,670
But the thing is they
don't think about Canada.

1863
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:14,420
There's a lot of people in this country
from a lot of other countries that just

1864
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:15,680
keep your fucking mouth shut.

1865
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:16,130
Yeah.

1866
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:16,963
No one knows.

1867
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:17,631
Like when,

1868
00:44:17,631 --> 00:44:19,250
whenever they say they know,

1869
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:22,310
like they take an estimate on how
many illegal aliens might vats.

1870
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:23,323
Yes,

1871
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:23,691
no.

1872
00:44:23,691 --> 00:44:24,150
Yes.

1873
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:24,983
Guest.

1874
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:26,390
Yeah.

1875
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:27,080
Well it's Kinda like,

1876
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:27,770
well,

1877
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:28,690
just thinking you actually had,

1878
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,350
uh,

1879
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:29,790
was it,

1880
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:30,980
uh,

1881
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:32,070
Brian Cox on?

1882
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:32,460
Yes.

1883
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:33,600
And he said when to talk about the,

1884
00:44:33,601 --> 00:44:34,051
the uh,

1885
00:44:34,051 --> 00:44:35,520
the size of the universe.

1886
00:44:35,521 --> 00:44:35,940
Yes.

1887
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:39,930
Most of it's just a guess based
on the observable universe,

1888
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:42,150
based on the number of
galaxies they can see.

1889
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:44,460
They're just guessing and
how many galaxies there are.

1890
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:46,200
I think that's the same as
the illegal immigration.

1891
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:47,140
You're just going,

1892
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:47,973
well,

1893
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:53,190
if we can be more likely to be accurate
with a illegal immigration than you are

1894
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:54,024
with stars.

1895
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:55,200
I don't know.

1896
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:55,620
Yeah.

1897
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:56,880
I think the star thing,

1898
00:44:56,881 --> 00:44:57,870
the problem is,

1899
00:44:58,310 --> 00:44:58,530
I'm,

1900
00:44:58,530 --> 00:44:59,340
I'll butcher this,

1901
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:04,340
but I think it's that literally we don't
have the capability to look past 13

1902
00:45:05,011 --> 00:45:06,630
point whatever billion years.

1903
00:45:06,631 --> 00:45:06,990
Yes.

1904
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:08,610
The big band really look.

1905
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:09,090
Yeah.

1906
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:10,020
So if they look and they go,

1907
00:45:10,021 --> 00:45:10,251
oh no,

1908
00:45:10,251 --> 00:45:10,301
on,

1909
00:45:10,301 --> 00:45:14,760
there's just like a big space and then
you go 18 more billion years back,

1910
00:45:14,761 --> 00:45:17,070
there was a thriving
community of galaxies,

1911
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:18,530
galaxies,

1912
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:19,590
that's distance and time.

1913
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:20,370
But then the,

1914
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:22,290
just the sheer vastness of the sky,

1915
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:24,120
they've only actually like,

1916
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:26,820
like looked at a fraction of it.

1917
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:27,600
Well,

1918
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,930
talking to a guy like him is so
amazing because you realize like,

1919
00:45:30,931 --> 00:45:31,171
okay,

1920
00:45:31,171 --> 00:45:32,700
well there's different kinds of humans.

1921
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:33,240
Yeah.

1922
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:33,541
There's,

1923
00:45:33,541 --> 00:45:38,070
there's humans that are actually studying
these insanely complicated equations

1924
00:45:38,071 --> 00:45:41,460
that are trying to prove that the
very nature of reality itself.

1925
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:45,000
And then there's champs like me
who are just listening going,

1926
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:45,391
oh,

1927
00:45:45,391 --> 00:45:45,800
okay.

1928
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:46,230
Yeah.

1929
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:46,621
Okay.

1930
00:45:46,621 --> 00:45:47,454
So Real,

1931
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:48,293
real big.

1932
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:50,161
Yeah.

1933
00:45:50,161 --> 00:45:50,994
Okay.

1934
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:53,220
How do we know it started?

1935
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:54,390
There was a bang.

1936
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:55,410
Okay.

1937
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:57,480
What started the Bang Mr Smarty pants,

1938
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:00,030
but I guess Brian Cox,

1939
00:46:00,031 --> 00:46:00,390
he's,

1940
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:05,390
he's innovative and that
he is an astrophysicist and
he looks like a young David

1941
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,020
Cassidy and he's a musician.

1942
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:07,730
Musician it,

1943
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:07,930
yeah.

1944
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:08,260
He's,

1945
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:08,970
he's dreamy.

1946
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:09,271
Yeah.

1947
00:46:09,271 --> 00:46:10,950
He's a great guy to have a crush on.

1948
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:12,323
I had a crush on him too.

1949
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:12,851
Oh my gosh.

1950
00:46:12,851 --> 00:46:14,370
Super Sweetheart of a guy too.

1951
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:16,050
Like not just never met him,

1952
00:46:16,051 --> 00:46:17,790
but I love watching him on TV.

1953
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:19,350
I did his podcast once,

1954
00:46:19,351 --> 00:46:20,520
the live version of it,

1955
00:46:20,521 --> 00:46:21,354
which is interesting.

1956
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:22,230
It was great.

1957
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:25,540
And he apparently has a new show that's
coming here that I'll go with his

1958
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,940
[inaudible] come with.

1959
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:27,181
Yeah,

1960
00:46:27,181 --> 00:46:27,511
I'd love to.

1961
00:46:27,511 --> 00:46:27,781
It's,

1962
00:46:27,781 --> 00:46:28,200
um,

1963
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:33,200
he has a gigantic screen behind him
filled with interlocking led screens that,

1964
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:34,490
uh,

1965
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:39,490
apparently it's like this unbelievably
gorgeous high definition version of the

1966
00:46:39,901 --> 00:46:40,734
cosmos.

1967
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:41,400
So,

1968
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,940
and it's created by the same
people who did that movie with,

1969
00:46:44,941 --> 00:46:45,774
uh,

1970
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:46,913
which one?

1971
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:47,580
Interstellar.

1972
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:48,413
Interstellar.

1973
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:48,920
No,

1974
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:49,880
it was created by it.

1975
00:46:49,881 --> 00:46:51,450
And it's like accurate,

1976
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:52,361
like the,

1977
00:46:52,361 --> 00:46:54,240
the CGI is actually accurate.

1978
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:54,540
Wow.

1979
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:57,930
According to his type of equations.

1980
00:46:57,970 --> 00:46:58,400
Yeah.

1981
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,490
He worked at Cerner and you know,

1982
00:46:59,491 --> 00:47:00,180
he's like,

1983
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:00,721
he's amazing.

1984
00:47:00,721 --> 00:47:01,261
He's amazing.

1985
00:47:01,261 --> 00:47:02,094
Yeah.

1986
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:02,821
And he's legit.

1987
00:47:02,821 --> 00:47:03,450
Beautiful Man.

1988
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:03,860
Yeah.

1989
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:04,380
Wow.

1990
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:05,213
Yeah.

1991
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,153
Nice.

1992
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:07,113
That's funny.

1993
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:10,440
David Cassidy was that,

1994
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:11,610
he was an abandoned the eighties.

1995
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:12,150
Oh yeah,

1996
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:12,361
no,

1997
00:47:12,361 --> 00:47:13,530
he was a legit rockstar.

1998
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:14,050
Yeah.

1999
00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:14,750
Yeah.

2000
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:15,330
I mean,

2001
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:15,991
genius.

2002
00:47:15,991 --> 00:47:16,824
Rockstar.

2003
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:17,160
Yeah.

2004
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,060
Good luck guys.

2005
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,340
That guy was trying to fuck your wife.

2006
00:47:20,341 --> 00:47:21,270
You've got a real problem.

2007
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,060
I think he was in [inaudible].

2008
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:23,460
Yeah.

2009
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:24,190
I think,

2010
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:25,170
is that what the band was?

2011
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:25,830
I don't know.

2012
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:26,700
Just make that up so much.

2013
00:47:26,701 --> 00:47:27,091
That shirt,

2014
00:47:27,091 --> 00:47:28,430
that wire astrophysicists,

2015
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:29,440
getting cuter.

2016
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,200
I mean,

2017
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:30,940
yeah.

2018
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:31,181
I mean,

2019
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:33,010
you start with Stephen
Hawking and then you get to,

2020
00:47:33,011 --> 00:47:33,461
what's his name?

2021
00:47:33,461 --> 00:47:34,210
Green,

2022
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:35,043
right?

2023
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:36,550
Neil degrasse Tyson.

2024
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:37,743
He's a handsome man.

2025
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:38,440
That's a fellow.

2026
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:38,921
And charming.

2027
00:47:38,921 --> 00:47:39,130
Sure.

2028
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:39,963
Yeah.

2029
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,073
Good laugh.

2030
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:41,670
Yeah.

2031
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:46,670
You didn't have to be pretty in the old
days position of science communicator is

2032
00:47:46,751 --> 00:47:47,710
so effective.

2033
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:52,711
It's so important because most of that
stuff is so dry and so difficult to wrap

2034
00:47:52,871 --> 00:47:53,651
your head around.

2035
00:47:53,651 --> 00:47:55,390
But you don't need someone,

2036
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:56,351
someone,

2037
00:47:56,351 --> 00:47:57,184
a Carl Sagan.

2038
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:58,150
Yes.

2039
00:47:58,150 --> 00:47:59,590
Someone engaging,

2040
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:00,910
they can deliver that.

2041
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:01,744
So like with,

2042
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:02,561
with Brian,

2043
00:48:02,561 --> 00:48:05,270
he's so nice like that as he's,

2044
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:08,230
he's like so smiley and
he enjoys it so much.

2045
00:48:08,231 --> 00:48:11,980
He loves talking about it so much that
it becomes infectious cause there's a lot

2046
00:48:11,981 --> 00:48:15,820
of that stuff that's very difficult to
follow when you try to read the papers.

2047
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:21,550
I read for Stephen Hawking books and I
would zone out so much while I was trying

2048
00:48:21,551 --> 00:48:23,200
to comprehend what was going on.

2049
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:25,090
I had Lawrence Krauss on and a,

2050
00:48:25,091 --> 00:48:27,760
I was trying to get him to explain,

2051
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:28,903
um,

2052
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:31,990
some certain formulas and just,

2053
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:34,750
even when he's explaining them to you,

2054
00:48:34,751 --> 00:48:37,870
it doesn't seem to click like you,

2055
00:48:37,871 --> 00:48:38,830
you really have to,

2056
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:39,770
it's one of those things you,

2057
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:44,230
it's like someone trying to explain French
words to you by only speaking to you

2058
00:48:44,231 --> 00:48:45,064
in French.

2059
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:46,400
Like,

2060
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:46,630
okay,

2061
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:47,800
but I don't speak French.

2062
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:48,101
And you're like,

2063
00:48:48,101 --> 00:48:48,281
yeah,

2064
00:48:48,281 --> 00:48:49,290
well you're fucked.

2065
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:55,070
Like soon as you say infinity that
that's only a mathematical idea.

2066
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:56,980
Yeah.

2067
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:59,260
I mean how can anything be infinite?

2068
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:00,280
I mean,

2069
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,113
I know,

2070
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:03,320
well there's minute math you can say it.

2071
00:49:03,321 --> 00:49:06,940
Like you can say that a straight line
goes on forever and two parallel lines

2072
00:49:06,941 --> 00:49:07,870
will never intersect.

2073
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,370
Pi As there theoretically,

2074
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:14,890
you know it never ends well why
is that difficult to grasp though?

2075
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:16,000
That's the real question.

2076
00:49:16,001 --> 00:49:16,990
Like why is,

2077
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:22,050
why do we need everything to be defined
by a very obvious beginning and an end?

2078
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:26,650
Cause it's in everything we experienced
has the beginning of that biologically

2079
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:28,090
as we expand as time,

2080
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:29,650
even in that time doesn't,

2081
00:49:29,651 --> 00:49:32,230
is not experienced
everywhere the same way.

2082
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:32,471
Well,

2083
00:49:32,471 --> 00:49:33,910
time is experienced at all.

2084
00:49:33,911 --> 00:49:38,580
If you're not sentient true
or what is tire Zona there,

2085
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:39,250
whack it off.

2086
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:40,000
It's different.

2087
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:40,420
But yeah,

2088
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:41,300
it's the,

2089
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:45,760
I always wondered if like there was a
reason why we wanted things to have a

2090
00:49:45,761 --> 00:49:46,750
beginning and an end.

2091
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,890
Like is it because we have our life and
our life has a beginning and an end all

2092
00:49:50,891 --> 00:49:55,891
the lives of the people we know or we
definitely are obsessed with a beginning

2093
00:49:57,011 --> 00:49:59,870
or an end or are we terrified of
beginnings and ends thought too.

2094
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,020
That's why we create,

2095
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:03,290
you know,

2096
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:07,840
God's and religions is because the idea
that that life ends and that it's all

2097
00:50:07,841 --> 00:50:08,674
been for nothing,

2098
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,060
she's terrifying to people.

2099
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:11,110
There's a little bit of that.

2100
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:12,513
Yeah.

2101
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:16,330
There's a little bit of like doing it
to create order in the community and

2102
00:50:16,331 --> 00:50:19,240
there's a little bit of people find
mushrooms and they need an explanation.

2103
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:20,910
What the fuck their feelings.

2104
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:21,190
Again,

2105
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:26,190
brains are constructed in such a way
that we need an end or else you don't

2106
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:27,351
understand.

2107
00:50:27,351 --> 00:50:28,100
Where am I now?

2108
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:28,370
I have,

2109
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:29,203
there's no end,

2110
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:31,490
a very uninformed theory,

2111
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:32,383
which is that

2112
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:38,540
first off that everything is meaningless
but that only the brain damaged or

2113
00:50:38,541 --> 00:50:43,541
capable of conceiving of meaninglessness
because our brains are meaning machines

2114
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:49,040
and that we evolved and it gave us an
evolutionary advantage that we give

2115
00:50:49,041 --> 00:50:49,700
meaning to things.

2116
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:50,120
Like I said,

2117
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,040
this is a table because
we say it's a table.

2118
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,750
It's not a table to a cat.

2119
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:59,150
That's why cat will just get up and walk
around on it from a mutual agreement.

2120
00:50:59,151 --> 00:50:59,270
Yeah,

2121
00:50:59,270 --> 00:50:59,691
we agree.

2122
00:50:59,691 --> 00:51:00,650
This is a table.

2123
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:03,620
And that kind of meaning
let us organize our lives,

2124
00:51:03,621 --> 00:51:05,510
let us be better hunters.

2125
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:06,531
Uh,

2126
00:51:06,531 --> 00:51:06,971
you know what?

2127
00:51:06,971 --> 00:51:08,570
You know it constantly,

2128
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:09,830
it occurs to me and bothers me,

2129
00:51:09,831 --> 00:51:13,700
is that we decided not to drive into
each other because we've painted a little

2130
00:51:13,701 --> 00:51:15,440
line on a road now in the middle.

2131
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:15,920
Yeah.

2132
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,500
We've all agreed not to cross that line.

2133
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:19,001
That's what I'm saying.

2134
00:51:19,001 --> 00:51:22,970
We ascribe meaning to objects and that
gave us an advantage over other animals.

2135
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:25,640
And so our brains just evolved.

2136
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:28,280
And then when we got to the point
where we realize we're going to die,

2137
00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:28,731
we go,

2138
00:51:28,731 --> 00:51:28,911
well,

2139
00:51:28,911 --> 00:51:30,740
there's gotta be some meaning there too.

2140
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:35,330
So then we had to create myths that
where do we go created meeting about our

2141
00:51:35,331 --> 00:51:36,140
lives?

2142
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:40,490
That's a very dangerous loop of there's
no meaning to everything and nothing has

2143
00:51:40,491 --> 00:51:41,810
no mean nothing has meaning.

2144
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:46,160
That's a dangerous loop for a person
psychologically because you can get stuck

2145
00:51:46,161 --> 00:51:48,080
in that and you can really,

2146
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:51,650
but I don't think you can because it's
impossible to conceive of unless you are

2147
00:51:51,651 --> 00:51:52,970
seriously brain damaged.

2148
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:53,331
Well,

2149
00:51:53,331 --> 00:51:53,601
no,

2150
00:51:53,601 --> 00:51:55,520
I don't think it's impossible to conceive.

2151
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:55,780
It's,

2152
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:56,150
it's,

2153
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:56,690
you won't,

2154
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:57,231
you can imagine,

2155
00:51:57,231 --> 00:51:58,580
you can intellectually think about it,

2156
00:51:58,581 --> 00:51:59,240
but you can't,

2157
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:00,410
you can't grasp it.

2158
00:52:00,411 --> 00:52:03,740
Really living in the now kind of
the same as life has no meaning,

2159
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:06,140
no office sing about the future.

2160
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:07,293
Thinking about,

2161
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:09,590
you're not thinking about the
fact that it has no meaning.

2162
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:13,250
You're enjoying life,

2163
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,840
you're enjoying experience,

2164
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:18,410
you're enjoying each interaction with
people and you're enjoying your thoughts.

2165
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:19,261
I think the,

2166
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:19,421
the,

2167
00:52:19,421 --> 00:52:20,930
the problem that people have is like,

2168
00:52:20,931 --> 00:52:21,680
what's the point?

2169
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:22,461
That's the problem.

2170
00:52:22,461 --> 00:52:22,671
That,

2171
00:52:22,671 --> 00:52:23,091
what's that?

2172
00:52:23,091 --> 00:52:23,871
What's the point?

2173
00:52:23,871 --> 00:52:24,460
Thought?

2174
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:25,430
And that's a weird loop.

2175
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:29,120
And that's the thing is it doesn't really
matter because you're going to create

2176
00:52:29,121 --> 00:52:29,954
a point anyway.

2177
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:30,771
Like,

2178
00:52:30,771 --> 00:52:31,480
I mean it's like there's,

2179
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:33,200
I was an existential psychology they had,

2180
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:37,550
there's like five different ways people
ascribe meaning metaphysical meaning

2181
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:38,510
reproductive meaning,

2182
00:52:38,511 --> 00:52:40,680
biological meaning uh,

2183
00:52:40,681 --> 00:52:43,270
or creative meaning like
the works you do right,

2184
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:47,180
that somehow you live on and all these
different ways you're like a lot of

2185
00:52:47,181 --> 00:52:51,290
atheists are tend to be
artists who believe that they
live on through their work

2186
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:53,930
and which is totally a
stupid is believing in God.

2187
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:54,561
It is.

2188
00:52:54,561 --> 00:52:55,670
It's definitely silly.

2189
00:52:55,671 --> 00:52:59,090
I mean obviously someone's going to enjoy
your work but I think the real meaning

2190
00:52:59,091 --> 00:53:02,240
is in creating the work and then the
fact that people are going to enjoy it if

2191
00:53:02,241 --> 00:53:04,430
you're doing it because you
want it to live on forever,

2192
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:06,560
you're a moron and good luck
with that because there's no,

2193
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:08,390
there's no forever the whole planet,

2194
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:11,390
but I just think meaning is an
inescapable product of the human mind.

2195
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:12,680
The example,

2196
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:13,513
one example is like,

2197
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:18,520
like they did a study where they went all
like into the jungles of the Amazon to

2198
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:21,680
people who have never had any contact
with the modern world and they drew a

2199
00:53:21,681 --> 00:53:25,470
circle with two dots and a curved
line and everyone sees a face.

2200
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:26,220
Hmm.

2201
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:27,210
Everyone sees a face.

2202
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:30,450
The only people who don't see a face or
people who have been brain damaged and

2203
00:53:30,451 --> 00:53:33,420
can no longer form the
meaning of those lines.

2204
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:33,841
Oh,

2205
00:53:33,841 --> 00:53:34,530
interesting.

2206
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:35,310
So you,

2207
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:39,510
there are people who suffer brain does
not correspond to their own artwork

2208
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:40,700
because like the,

2209
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:45,150
our work is very similar to our artwork
and the fact that stick figures and they

2210
00:53:45,151 --> 00:53:47,550
represent humans and the
circle or does that's ahead.

2211
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:47,851
Yeah.

2212
00:53:47,851 --> 00:53:48,600
All that stuff.

2213
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,330
But they probably haven't
had the happy face tee shirt.

2214
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:55,140
I had lunch with Erich
von Daniken last week.

2215
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:55,800
Oh my God.

2216
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:56,610
Yes.

2217
00:53:56,610 --> 00:53:57,690
Very interesting.

2218
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:58,560
Very weird.

2219
00:53:59,130 --> 00:54:00,990
He's the guy who wrote
chariots of the gods.

2220
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:05,010
He's in his eighties now fuck their house.

2221
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:05,610
And uh,

2222
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:06,990
he was showing us slides.

2223
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:08,460
What's the real story there?

2224
00:54:08,461 --> 00:54:11,070
I was wondering mostly nonsense,

2225
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:12,623
unfortunately.

2226
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:13,320
Yeah.

2227
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:13,651
Yeah.

2228
00:54:13,651 --> 00:54:14,400
Mostly.

2229
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,210
Mostly what it is as evidence of law,

2230
00:54:17,211 --> 00:54:18,090
civilizations,

2231
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:20,610
ancient civilizations that
were incredibly advanced.

2232
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:25,680
I follow the work of Graham Hancock and
Randall Carlson and a few other people

2233
00:54:25,681 --> 00:54:29,490
that are being proven actually
correct more and more,

2234
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:32,400
almost on a daily basis
by new discoveries.

2235
00:54:32,401 --> 00:54:33,700
It show that the,

2236
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:37,710
that civilization predates
what we initially thought,

2237
00:54:38,450 --> 00:54:43,410
that the initial thought was that
somewhere around the great pyramids,

2238
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:46,140
which is like 2,500 BC,

2239
00:54:46,141 --> 00:54:47,730
that was about as good as anybody got.

2240
00:54:47,731 --> 00:54:49,800
And you go back to like ancient Sumeria,

2241
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:51,720
which is about 6,000 years ago.

2242
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:53,000
And then that's basically it.

2243
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:55,560
What they're saying is that no,

2244
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:57,810
there was most likely a reset,

2245
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:01,980
a global reset of civilization
due to a cataclysmic disaster.

2246
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:03,750
And there's a shit ton of evidence.

2247
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:08,130
There's massive evidence in the form
of this nuclear glass that exist when

2248
00:55:08,131 --> 00:55:09,660
there's asteroidal impacts.

2249
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:10,590
And,

2250
00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:10,890
um,

2251
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:14,490
also there's a guy named doctor Robert
Schoch is of the first guys to propose.

2252
00:55:14,491 --> 00:55:16,740
This is actually when he
freaked me on the podcast.

2253
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:21,660
He said there was a mass coronal ejection
that most likely caused lightening

2254
00:55:21,661 --> 00:55:24,000
storms like a rainstorm,

2255
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:28,410
but lightning like that much lightning
destroying the Glam and that the only

2256
00:55:28,411 --> 00:55:31,560
people that survived were people that
could get under cover that could get into.

2257
00:55:33,050 --> 00:55:38,050
Yeah and the mass extinction of 60 plus
percent of the large mammals in a very

2258
00:55:39,001 --> 00:55:42,060
short window of time almost
instantaneously in North America.

2259
00:55:42,430 --> 00:55:44,580
The the end of the Ice Age,

2260
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:49,760
like 10,000 plus years ago there was a
mile high ice in most of North America,

2261
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:51,060
right?

2262
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:54,600
Most of North American covered in
ice and then gone and all these,

2263
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,280
all these areas,

2264
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:58,800
all these points of
interest point to this one,

2265
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,570
one moment in time.

2266
00:56:00,571 --> 00:56:05,460
That's somewhere between 10 and 12,000
years ago that some big event happened

2267
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:10,170
and that most likely just
crippled civilization and
then people had to rebuild

2268
00:56:10,171 --> 00:56:15,060
whatever people were around
on that because it's also
that they found like just

2269
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:20,130
looking at DNA that all of humanity at
one point got wiped out except for like

2270
00:56:20,131 --> 00:56:23,130
one village that there
was only that everyone is,

2271
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:24,010
everyone has

2272
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:27,770
descended from the same
group of about 5,000 people.

2273
00:56:27,771 --> 00:56:28,090
That's well,

2274
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:32,890
there was a super volcano that erupted
somewhere around 70,000 years ago.

2275
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:37,830
They think this is predating
this cataclysmic disaster
of 12,000 years ago that

2276
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:41,410
they are pretty sure wiped human
beings down to a few thousand folks.

2277
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:42,490
Oh yeah.

2278
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:45,513
I want to say it's,

2279
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,210
where's that?

2280
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:47,380
That super volcano,

2281
00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:47,860
there's,

2282
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:50,260
there's a supervolcano that
knocked everybody down.

2283
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:51,890
We'll find it.

2284
00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:52,700
Yeah.

2285
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:53,770
We've got one under Yosemite,

2286
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:54,633
right.

2287
00:56:56,250 --> 00:57:00,130
Call Dara is going to get us
all every six to 800,000 years.

2288
00:57:00,131 --> 00:57:00,920
It blows.

2289
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:01,300
Right.

2290
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:02,500
That's why I don't go camping.

2291
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,740
That's might not be the worst place to go.

2292
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:07,060
Like go camping.

2293
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:08,530
Yeah.

2294
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:09,370
That way when it ends,

2295
00:57:09,371 --> 00:57:09,971
it ends quick.

2296
00:57:09,971 --> 00:57:11,380
You don't want to be living in New York,

2297
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:12,800
which was choking on it.

2298
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:16,151
That's the worst.

2299
00:57:16,151 --> 00:57:18,250
Watching people eat homeless
folks in the street.

2300
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:18,880
Yeah.

2301
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:19,391
There's no,

2302
00:57:19,391 --> 00:57:19,680
uh,

2303
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,010
there's now in a place.

2304
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:21,933
Yeah.

2305
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:22,270
Well,

2306
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:22,791
it's awesome.

2307
00:57:22,791 --> 00:57:23,200
I'm like,

2308
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:26,230
things that fly through space and zip by,

2309
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:26,880
you know,

2310
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:27,600
like they're,

2311
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,830
they're just constantly
finding these things.

2312
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:31,173
That's the lights things,

2313
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:32,350
the Erich von Daniken thing.

2314
00:57:32,351 --> 00:57:34,120
I remember as a kid going,

2315
00:57:34,121 --> 00:57:38,230
my problem was that they kept showing
these massive paintings that can only be

2316
00:57:38,231 --> 00:57:39,190
seen from the sky.

2317
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,850
So therefore there must have been
John for your aliens and I can,

2318
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:42,971
you know,

2319
00:57:42,971 --> 00:57:45,040
if you believe God is looking down on you,

2320
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:47,410
you're going to draw a big
paintings for God to look at.

2321
00:57:47,950 --> 00:57:48,910
So you don't need that.

2322
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:49,261
But now,

2323
00:57:49,261 --> 00:57:49,870
right.

2324
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:50,920
But now I'm more,

2325
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:51,641
the,

2326
00:57:51,641 --> 00:57:52,474
uh,

2327
00:57:52,650 --> 00:57:57,650
thing I've become obsessed with lately
is there's a skepticism about Ufos.

2328
00:57:59,200 --> 00:57:59,471
Yeah.

2329
00:57:59,471 --> 00:58:02,110
That's why I want to talk to you about
this because you told me that you've

2330
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:04,110
become obsessed with Ufos recently.

2331
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:04,810
Oh yeah.

2332
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:05,291
Completely.

2333
00:58:05,291 --> 00:58:06,124
And it's like,

2334
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:07,090
yeah,

2335
00:58:07,090 --> 00:58:07,660
totally.

2336
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:08,110
Really?

2337
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:08,321
Yeah,

2338
00:58:08,321 --> 00:58:10,870
totally believe the
UFO phenomenon is real.

2339
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:11,741
I don't know what it is,

2340
00:58:11,741 --> 00:58:12,460
but it's totally,

2341
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:13,450
it has to be real.

2342
00:58:13,451 --> 00:58:14,160
Some things happened.

2343
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:14,950
Why is that?

2344
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:17,140
Because there's just way too
much evidence that it is real.

2345
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:17,830
What evidence?

2346
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:18,641
Uh,

2347
00:58:18,641 --> 00:58:19,001
well,

2348
00:58:19,001 --> 00:58:19,834
uh,

2349
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:20,950
radar evidence,

2350
00:58:20,970 --> 00:58:21,170
uh,

2351
00:58:21,170 --> 00:58:21,840
that the,

2352
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:24,370
the [inaudible] locked on a Ufo,

2353
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:26,470
that footage and also just,

2354
00:58:26,471 --> 00:58:27,160
uh,

2355
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:28,750
like I know that friend of ours,

2356
00:58:28,751 --> 00:58:30,130
I don't know if she wants to say it,

2357
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:34,270
but her father was an air traffic
controller and he told her,

2358
00:58:34,271 --> 00:58:34,630
they said,

2359
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:34,840
yeah,

2360
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:36,670
every air traffic controller
has seen something.

2361
00:58:36,970 --> 00:58:37,420
Yeah.

2362
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:41,140
And I had another friend whose father
was in a commercial pilot and she said,

2363
00:58:41,141 --> 00:58:41,440
yeah,

2364
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:45,280
my dad said every single pilot has seen
something and they've all been told not

2365
00:58:45,281 --> 00:58:46,114
to say anything about it.

2366
00:58:46,450 --> 00:58:49,410
We have a couple of friends
that say they were abducted.

2367
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:50,200
Yeah.

2368
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:50,410
Yeah.

2369
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:54,820
The abducted one is a little easier to
wrap your head around because when you're

2370
00:58:54,821 --> 00:58:55,420
sleeping,

2371
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:58,660
your brain is producing all sorts
of indogenous psychedelic chemicals.

2372
00:58:58,710 --> 00:58:58,930
Yeah.

2373
00:58:58,930 --> 00:59:01,990
Almost all of these experiences
happen when you're sleeping.

2374
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:03,340
Almost all of these experience,

2375
00:59:03,341 --> 00:59:04,240
when these people were abducted,

2376
00:59:04,241 --> 00:59:05,320
they're taken from their beds,

2377
00:59:05,321 --> 00:59:06,340
which is when they're dreaming.

2378
00:59:06,730 --> 00:59:06,971
I mean,

2379
00:59:06,971 --> 00:59:08,800
it's just like there's some real clear,

2380
00:59:08,801 --> 00:59:10,580
easy steps to follow up on a fall,

2381
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:11,890
Occam's razor and not,

2382
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:12,790
you're not get crazy,

2383
00:59:12,791 --> 00:59:13,601
but it knocks those out,

2384
00:59:13,601 --> 00:59:16,180
but it doesn't knock out like Barney and
Betty Hill and all the people that are

2385
00:59:16,181 --> 00:59:19,210
abducted will fully conscious and
that and that remember it without

2386
00:59:19,211 --> 00:59:20,044
hypnotherapy.

2387
00:59:20,350 --> 00:59:21,440
I'm like,

2388
00:59:21,441 --> 00:59:22,070
I'm not sure about

2389
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:23,150
the abduction phenomenon,

2390
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:25,250
but I don't know Barney and Betty Hill.

2391
00:59:25,251 --> 00:59:26,084
I know the story,

2392
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:27,080
but I don't know them,

2393
00:59:27,470 --> 00:59:31,760
so I would have to know them because
there's a lot of people that I've taught,

2394
00:59:31,790 --> 00:59:33,220
like I did a show for Scifi,

2395
00:59:33,221 --> 00:59:34,400
I called Joe Rogan questions.

2396
00:59:34,401 --> 00:59:36,920
Everything that cured me.

2397
00:59:37,330 --> 00:59:39,980
It show cured me of a
lot of my nonsense with,

2398
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:42,520
with conspiracies when
we used to talk about,

2399
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:43,040
yes.

2400
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:43,400
Yeah,

2401
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:44,660
that's definitely him all the time.

2402
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:45,020
Yeah,

2403
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:45,261
yeah.

2404
00:59:45,261 --> 00:59:45,750
But I,

2405
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:47,540
I needed to actually study it.

2406
00:59:47,541 --> 00:59:48,770
So for six months,

2407
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:50,360
that's basically all I did.

2408
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:54,830
I interviewed people and
I like big foot believers,

2409
00:59:54,831 --> 00:59:56,180
Ufo believers.

2410
00:59:56,810 --> 01:00:01,810
And the one thing that they have in
common is they all seem to be kind of lost

2411
01:00:03,110 --> 01:00:05,330
and dependent upon this thing being real.

2412
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:06,050
Yeah.

2413
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:07,270
Instead of being objective.

2414
01:00:07,271 --> 01:00:11,960
There's only one lady that I interviewed
that saw big that really seemed to be

2415
01:00:11,961 --> 01:00:12,794
telling the truth,

2416
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:16,490
but I think she saw bear bear's
walk on two feet all the time.

2417
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:17,510
They do it all the time.

2418
01:00:17,511 --> 01:00:18,261
It's video footage,

2419
01:00:18,261 --> 01:00:19,430
you to find it all the time.

2420
01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:21,380
And she was in the Pacific northwest,

2421
01:00:21,381 --> 01:00:23,000
which is incredibly dense woods.

2422
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:24,290
You see something,

2423
01:00:24,291 --> 01:00:25,124
you glimpse it.

2424
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:26,630
Look I was hunting once in,

2425
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:27,021
in,

2426
01:00:27,021 --> 01:00:30,350
in Canada and Alberta and I thought
I saw a wolf for like two seconds.

2427
01:00:30,351 --> 01:00:31,184
It was a squirrel.

2428
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:32,110
Okay.

2429
01:00:32,110 --> 01:00:32,900
Understand this.

2430
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:35,880
This is fucking not squirrel.

2431
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:36,190
Yeah,

2432
01:00:36,190 --> 01:00:37,480
no I just saw far right.

2433
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:42,540
I saw for cause it's really dense was
cause I was looking for fucking wolves

2434
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:43,910
cause I was like,

2435
01:00:43,910 --> 01:00:45,830
cause I know we did see one wolf.

2436
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:47,600
It cross the roads.

2437
01:00:47,601 --> 01:00:50,360
Either wolf or coyote was hard
to tell cause it was at dusk.

2438
01:00:50,361 --> 01:00:51,320
It was very dark out.

2439
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:52,453
But um,

2440
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:54,200
when you're looking for something,

2441
01:00:54,201 --> 01:00:56,150
you think everything is that
thing you're looking for.

2442
01:00:56,151 --> 01:00:56,570
Yeah.

2443
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:57,100
So for like a,

2444
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:57,950
for a second,

2445
01:00:58,050 --> 01:01:00,410
huge thought that fucking
squirrel was a wolf.

2446
01:01:00,411 --> 01:01:00,891
That's funny.

2447
01:01:00,891 --> 01:01:01,400
Yeah.

2448
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,350
Well the expectation and
perception are very linked.

2449
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:03,980
Yes.

2450
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:04,700
Yes.

2451
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:09,700
Well this us that they found that that
50% of everything you see is a product of

2452
01:01:10,251 --> 01:01:10,800
memory.

2453
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:11,570
Yes.

2454
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:11,880
That,

2455
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:13,370
that when you observe something,

2456
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:17,900
they've done frm Mris and that most
of the activity in the brain is in the

2457
01:01:17,901 --> 01:01:18,530
memory centers,

2458
01:01:18,530 --> 01:01:19,071
not in the,

2459
01:01:19,071 --> 01:01:19,460
uh,

2460
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:20,300
visual sneakers.

2461
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:20,931
Interesting.

2462
01:01:20,931 --> 01:01:22,450
Only about 50% of the activities,

2463
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:23,400
individual centers of the brain.

2464
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:24,710
That's crazy.

2465
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:25,191
Well,

2466
01:01:25,191 --> 01:01:25,280
the

2467
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,113
thing is very,

2468
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:26,490
I,

2469
01:01:26,490 --> 01:01:27,900
when I was a kid,

2470
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:32,550
I went and saw Carl Sagan speak at u of
t at the University of Toronto and I was

2471
01:01:32,551 --> 01:01:32,761
like,

2472
01:01:32,761 --> 01:01:33,510
you know,

2473
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:38,510
14 but he did an equation on the board
of the possibility of alien life other

2474
01:01:41,071 --> 01:01:42,120
than us in the universe.

2475
01:01:42,690 --> 01:01:44,850
And it came to the smallest.

2476
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:45,181
I mean,

2477
01:01:45,181 --> 01:01:47,310
he spent the whole time
writing on this chalkboard.

2478
01:01:47,790 --> 01:01:48,960
It was fascinating.

2479
01:01:49,630 --> 01:01:54,240
They actually came up with a number
at the end and it was such a small,

2480
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:56,250
he says there is,

2481
01:01:56,490 --> 01:01:58,290
there is something out there,

2482
01:01:58,950 --> 01:02:03,860
but they are so far away that they'll,

2483
01:02:04,110 --> 01:02:06,660
that unless they can go faster
than the speed of light,

2484
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:09,750
which he said was impossible at the time.

2485
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:10,380
Yeah.

2486
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:11,213
The Seventies.

2487
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:11,860
Yeah.

2488
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:12,693
Uh,

2489
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:14,430
there's no way we've seen them.

2490
01:02:14,610 --> 01:02:15,301
That's what he said.

2491
01:02:15,301 --> 01:02:20,250
So if some other beings have
conquered speed of light thing,

2492
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,050
then maybe we could see them.

2493
01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:22,943
Yeah.

2494
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:27,980
But that's a thing with the exact problem
with his skepticism in general is like

2495
01:02:29,281 --> 01:02:29,730
a,

2496
01:02:29,730 --> 01:02:30,563
that it,

2497
01:02:30,930 --> 01:02:31,141
you know,

2498
01:02:31,141 --> 01:02:31,320
like,

2499
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:32,190
like the skeptics,

2500
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:33,150
skeptics of the,

2501
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:34,470
of the 19th century,

2502
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:36,060
the ones who said germs don't exist.

2503
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:36,360
Right.

2504
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:37,140
Cause we can't see them.

2505
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:37,550
And,

2506
01:02:37,550 --> 01:02:41,190
and people who said germs did exist were
ridiculed and laughed out of the trade.

2507
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:42,170
Right.

2508
01:02:42,170 --> 01:02:44,910
And I agree with you completely.

2509
01:02:44,911 --> 01:02:47,460
Just because you can't see
it or it isn't happening.

2510
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:48,660
It doesn't mean it can't happen.

2511
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,820
And even since Sagans Day be,

2512
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:53,910
there had been no exoplanets
discovered then we now though,

2513
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:57,120
there are literally trillions and
trillions of sure planet earth,

2514
01:02:57,121 --> 01:02:57,954
like planets.

2515
01:02:58,650 --> 01:02:59,040
Yeah,

2516
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:02,480
well they just speculate
as to the existence of them
outside of our sources and

2517
01:03:02,481 --> 01:03:03,260
before the,

2518
01:03:03,260 --> 01:03:04,920
the real problem is that if some,

2519
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:07,140
there's a leap and a leap,

2520
01:03:07,141 --> 01:03:12,141
a technological leap that opens the doors
to massive innovation that once this

2521
01:03:12,811 --> 01:03:13,740
happens,

2522
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,180
once this happens in this,

2523
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:20,360
and then all this stuff sort
of exponentially expands
in terms of technological

2524
01:03:20,851 --> 01:03:21,684
possibilities,

2525
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:26,840
all you would need is a few hundred years
and you have an unrecognizable set of

2526
01:03:28,681 --> 01:03:29,520
technology.

2527
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:30,120
Yeah,

2528
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:30,600
sure.

2529
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:32,670
You know what were talking about certain,

2530
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:33,091
I mean,

2531
01:03:33,091 --> 01:03:33,600
you know,

2532
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:36,690
anti matter idea that they're
still trying to figure out,

2533
01:03:37,670 --> 01:03:38,060
uh,

2534
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:43,060
that's an insane sorts of energy
you have never even experienced.

2535
01:03:43,741 --> 01:03:44,490
Yeah.

2536
01:03:44,490 --> 01:03:45,323
You know,

2537
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:46,010
with the,

2538
01:03:46,010 --> 01:03:50,400
with us grain of sand and you can
run a city and it was that big.

2539
01:03:51,070 --> 01:03:52,290
And then there's also the theory,

2540
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:53,370
there's recent one,

2541
01:03:53,371 --> 01:03:55,350
that space time itself doesn't exist.

2542
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:56,781
So the,

2543
01:03:56,781 --> 01:04:01,370
the speed of light barrier
becomes moot because that is,

2544
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:04,690
I guess it's the holographic
quantum hologram there.

2545
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:06,480
Quantum holographic
theory of the universe.

2546
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:08,910
Sounds like Talbot's book.

2547
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:09,421
Uh,

2548
01:04:09,421 --> 01:04:11,220
I can't remember holographic universe,

2549
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:12,060
but it's,

2550
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:12,271
yeah,

2551
01:04:12,271 --> 01:04:12,990
I think so.

2552
01:04:12,990 --> 01:04:16,170
But the idea that the universe is
basically just a geometry that,

2553
01:04:16,590 --> 01:04:19,530
that when you look at it from a certain
angle seems three dimensional and it

2554
01:04:19,531 --> 01:04:19,961
folds on,

2555
01:04:19,961 --> 01:04:21,180
it folds into itself.

2556
01:04:21,210 --> 01:04:22,043
So you could,

2557
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:24,510
and it's traveled through
the wormhole thing.

2558
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:25,501
It's not even that,

2559
01:04:25,501 --> 01:04:26,370
it's the idea that,

2560
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:27,030
that,

2561
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:29,460
that space time is an illusion is,

2562
01:04:29,470 --> 01:04:30,303
uh,

2563
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:31,070
and that,

2564
01:04:31,070 --> 01:04:32,070
that it doesn't really exist.

2565
01:04:32,071 --> 01:04:32,881
And that's why,

2566
01:04:32,881 --> 01:04:33,180
uh,

2567
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:33,421
you know,

2568
01:04:33,421 --> 01:04:33,660
like,

2569
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:34,493
uh,

2570
01:04:34,650 --> 01:04:35,010
uh,

2571
01:04:35,010 --> 01:04:36,720
entanglement is possible.

2572
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:37,501
You know,

2573
01:04:37,501 --> 01:04:37,981
the idea that,

2574
01:04:37,981 --> 01:04:38,160
you know,

2575
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:38,581
spooky,

2576
01:04:38,581 --> 01:04:39,900
spooky action at a distance.

2577
01:04:39,930 --> 01:04:40,470
Yes.

2578
01:04:40,470 --> 01:04:42,870
That a quantum entanglement.

2579
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:44,613
The reason that,

2580
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:45,420
you know,

2581
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:45,811
you know,

2582
01:04:45,811 --> 01:04:46,644
uh,

2583
01:04:47,010 --> 01:04:47,311
these,

2584
01:04:47,311 --> 01:04:47,491
you know,

2585
01:04:47,491 --> 01:04:51,630
Adam's on opposite ends of the universe
can be affect each other instantaneously

2586
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:54,810
is cause they're not really at
an opposite ends of the universe.

2587
01:04:54,811 --> 01:04:55,860
They're really right next to each other.

2588
01:04:55,861 --> 01:04:57,930
It just seems like they're at
opposite ends of the universe.

2589
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:03,200
Because our ability to
perceive as basically based
on what we have to do to stay

2590
01:05:03,661 --> 01:05:05,040
alive on this planet.

2591
01:05:05,130 --> 01:05:07,590
So our meager little chimp brains,

2592
01:05:07,810 --> 01:05:08,970
you have trying to,

2593
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:12,810
trying to quantify all of these things
that are around us all the time.

2594
01:05:12,811 --> 01:05:16,920
So we put them into this sort of
three dimensional box of movement and,

2595
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:18,580
and that the entire,

2596
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:23,440
the entire universe could be a compact
thing that projects itself like a

2597
01:05:23,441 --> 01:05:25,480
hologram onto a screen.

2598
01:05:25,590 --> 01:05:28,260
I love these kinds of conversations
because I'm clearly too stupid to really

2599
01:05:28,261 --> 01:05:29,580
understand what I don't understand.

2600
01:05:29,650 --> 01:05:32,690
I don't listen anything I just said
and I don't understand you too.

2601
01:05:32,691 --> 01:05:33,990
So how stupid does that make me?

2602
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:34,681
Well,

2603
01:05:34,681 --> 01:05:35,700
we don't understand each other.

2604
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:37,193
We're all the same.

2605
01:05:37,530 --> 01:05:38,363
Yeah.

2606
01:05:39,410 --> 01:05:42,080
I think it'd be interesting to do it
like a documentary or something about,

2607
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:43,550
uh,

2608
01:05:43,550 --> 01:05:44,330
about euphology.

2609
01:05:44,330 --> 01:05:46,730
Cause if one thing is the assumption
that they're extra terrestrial is an

2610
01:05:46,731 --> 01:05:47,564
assumption.

2611
01:05:48,830 --> 01:05:53,830
But the thing that intrigues me is
the power of ridicule to silence.

2612
01:05:54,230 --> 01:05:57,980
Even the most intelligent people in our
community from examining something like

2613
01:05:57,981 --> 01:06:01,370
the ridicule kept doctors
from accepting germs.

2614
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:02,150
Sure.

2615
01:06:02,150 --> 01:06:03,110
Cause they didn't want to,

2616
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:06,260
they didn't want to be
ridiculed by their peers.

2617
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:08,300
And even now you've got people that will,

2618
01:06:08,330 --> 01:06:13,330
like Michael Shermer will cling to the
most absurd explanations for phenomena

2619
01:06:14,031 --> 01:06:16,550
like the f 16 a radar footage.

2620
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:17,810
Uh,

2621
01:06:17,810 --> 01:06:18,230
what did he,

2622
01:06:18,230 --> 01:06:19,510
what was a Michael Shermer,

2623
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:20,480
I can't even remember,

2624
01:06:20,510 --> 01:06:21,050
but it was,

2625
01:06:21,050 --> 01:06:22,100
it was pretty,

2626
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:26,120
it really went to great lengths
that entailed having to basically,

2627
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:27,590
uh,

2628
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:31,790
diminish any respect you have for any of
the people who reported on the events.

2629
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:36,590
It had to go and had to go into character
assassination in order to eliminate

2630
01:06:36,591 --> 01:06:36,990
it.

2631
01:06:36,990 --> 01:06:37,411
Yeah,

2632
01:06:37,411 --> 01:06:38,970
he loves the best way to kill an idea.

2633
01:06:39,030 --> 01:06:42,210
He's a professional skeptic and I like
Michael a lot and he's been on the

2634
01:06:42,211 --> 01:06:43,160
podcast may times,

2635
01:06:43,161 --> 01:06:43,440
but yeah,

2636
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:46,020
I actually had him debate
Randall Carlson and,

2637
01:06:46,270 --> 01:06:46,980
um,

2638
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:51,980
Graham Hancock about these ancient
civilizations and it wasn't very good for

2639
01:06:52,021 --> 01:06:52,320
him.

2640
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:52,970
Like,

2641
01:06:52,970 --> 01:06:54,720
or some swanky moments.

2642
01:06:54,750 --> 01:06:56,100
Cause skeptics are believers.

2643
01:06:56,130 --> 01:06:57,880
Well the problem is they're leaving.

2644
01:06:58,200 --> 01:06:58,861
Even Scott,

2645
01:06:58,861 --> 01:07:01,020
the problem is being a skeptic itself,

2646
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:02,700
it's a stupid way to look at the world.

2647
01:07:03,270 --> 01:07:05,010
You're actually sure about something.

2648
01:07:05,011 --> 01:07:06,630
I don't mean you shouldn't be objective.

2649
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:07,330
No.

2650
01:07:07,330 --> 01:07:08,190
Be Skeptical.

2651
01:07:08,550 --> 01:07:09,510
Being skeptical is like,

2652
01:07:09,630 --> 01:07:10,160
ah,

2653
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:11,100
I don't know.

2654
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:13,530
But I know for sure that that's not true,

2655
01:07:14,010 --> 01:07:18,900
but it serves a massive purpose for
people that really don't understand things

2656
01:07:18,901 --> 01:07:19,900
and he can explain it to you.

2657
01:07:19,901 --> 01:07:21,300
And with actual science,

2658
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:24,690
as long as the actual science
is being used and it's not,

2659
01:07:24,691 --> 01:07:26,910
character assassination is not mockery.

2660
01:07:26,910 --> 01:07:27,743
It's not,

2661
01:07:27,750 --> 01:07:28,530
it's not.

2662
01:07:28,530 --> 01:07:31,560
There's certain people
that are just debunkers.

2663
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:33,330
They can call themselves skeptics,

2664
01:07:33,331 --> 01:07:34,890
but they're not looking at things like,

2665
01:07:35,010 --> 01:07:35,191
oh,

2666
01:07:35,191 --> 01:07:36,330
maybe that is effective.

2667
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:37,320
Maybe that is healthy.

2668
01:07:37,650 --> 01:07:39,150
That is interesting and no,

2669
01:07:39,151 --> 01:07:40,200
they don't look at it that way.

2670
01:07:40,201 --> 01:07:41,010
They're looking at it,

2671
01:07:41,010 --> 01:07:45,630
they're trying to pick it apart and
that's fine if you can pick it apart,

2672
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:46,710
but if you cannot,

2673
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:49,170
you have to be objective
about the fact that,

2674
01:07:49,350 --> 01:07:52,830
oh well this is a very interesting
phenomenon and this is what we know about

2675
01:07:52,831 --> 01:07:53,581
science is that,

2676
01:07:53,581 --> 01:07:55,200
and this is what we know about this thing.

2677
01:07:55,201 --> 01:07:56,490
And right now we have,

2678
01:07:56,610 --> 01:07:57,870
we have a weird conundrum.

2679
01:07:57,980 --> 01:07:59,550
Did chariots of the gods,

2680
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:01,590
did he work on Danica was,

2681
01:08:01,591 --> 01:08:04,400
he was he hundred percent

2682
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:06,620
he's all is still in all in.

2683
01:08:06,770 --> 01:08:07,371
I asked him,

2684
01:08:07,371 --> 01:08:08,121
the first thing I asked him,

2685
01:08:08,121 --> 01:08:08,331
I said,

2686
01:08:08,331 --> 01:08:11,260
what is it the desperately
have to go pee go.

2687
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:16,600
The first thing I asked him was
what is the most piece of evidence?

2688
01:08:17,140 --> 01:08:17,690
Does the,

2689
01:08:17,690 --> 01:08:18,051
you know,

2690
01:08:18,051 --> 01:08:20,030
and he pointed to this,

2691
01:08:20,031 --> 01:08:20,864
um,

2692
01:08:20,990 --> 01:08:24,980
a Mayan stone plaque that's in Pelinka.

2693
01:08:25,370 --> 01:08:26,510
I'm gonna have you ever seen it?

2694
01:08:26,511 --> 01:08:27,344
It's a,

2695
01:08:27,810 --> 01:08:28,670
it's this book.

2696
01:08:28,810 --> 01:08:29,840
It's a god,

2697
01:08:30,130 --> 01:08:31,310
a one of their,

2698
01:08:31,311 --> 01:08:32,030
um,

2699
01:08:32,030 --> 01:08:36,020
one of their former kings that
is lying on his back and he's,

2700
01:08:36,021 --> 01:08:38,150
it looks like he's moving some,

2701
01:08:38,250 --> 01:08:38,781
see Jamie,

2702
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:39,860
see if we could find that thing.

2703
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:41,420
It's this really cool,

2704
01:08:41,890 --> 01:08:42,440
uh,

2705
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:47,440
carving that they found that looks like
there's a guy who is in a seat and it

2706
01:08:47,931 --> 01:08:50,390
looks like there's fire behind his back.

2707
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:51,730
And you could say,

2708
01:08:52,010 --> 01:08:56,240
you could say that he's manipulating
controls on a ship and he's,

2709
01:08:56,290 --> 01:08:56,720
you know,

2710
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:58,250
shooting a rocket into the heaven.

2711
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:00,370
I would like to see what the s,

2712
01:09:01,310 --> 01:09:03,980
the mainstream version of
that is because it also,

2713
01:09:03,981 --> 01:09:04,970
it could just be art,

2714
01:09:05,670 --> 01:09:06,020
you know,

2715
01:09:06,020 --> 01:09:06,920
I'm imagining being,

2716
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:07,610
yeah,

2717
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:08,720
it could be that they,

2718
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:12,380
they knew about certain things
being propelled by fire.

2719
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:13,150
There it is.

2720
01:09:13,150 --> 01:09:13,460
Yep.

2721
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:14,293
That's it.

2722
01:09:14,510 --> 01:09:15,680
So if you see this,

2723
01:09:16,010 --> 01:09:16,221
I mean,

2724
01:09:16,221 --> 01:09:17,840
that's a big ass stretch to say,

2725
01:09:17,841 --> 01:09:18,980
that guy's in a spaceship.

2726
01:09:19,010 --> 01:09:20,330
I don't know what the fuck that is.

2727
01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:22,710
He's sitting down can alter kind of.

2728
01:09:23,090 --> 01:09:23,660
He could.

2729
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:24,111
Yeah,

2730
01:09:24,111 --> 01:09:26,270
but it doesn't look like
he's looking through an Ip.

2731
01:09:26,330 --> 01:09:26,720
Right.

2732
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:27,553
What's true,

2733
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:28,881
but what does that mean?

2734
01:09:28,881 --> 01:09:29,750
Is it a telescope?

2735
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:31,060
Maybe he's just kind of telescope.

2736
01:09:31,061 --> 01:09:32,720
I mean they just an astronomer.

2737
01:09:32,990 --> 01:09:33,560
Yeah,

2738
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:34,311
it is possible.

2739
01:09:34,311 --> 01:09:35,870
I don't think they had telescopes.

2740
01:09:36,590 --> 01:09:39,080
I don't think it telescope
was even invented till no.

2741
01:09:39,081 --> 01:09:40,520
Do they even have glass at that point?

2742
01:09:40,550 --> 01:09:41,660
Oh No.

2743
01:09:41,690 --> 01:09:43,160
Well I don't know if the Mayans did.

2744
01:09:43,390 --> 01:09:44,030
Wow.

2745
01:09:44,030 --> 01:09:44,330
But,

2746
01:09:44,330 --> 01:09:47,900
but that was his number one
piece of evidence was wow.

2747
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:48,411
I was like,

2748
01:09:48,411 --> 01:09:49,790
that's kind of silly.

2749
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:52,190
I mean when we were kids in the 70s the,

2750
01:09:52,270 --> 01:09:52,560
you know,

2751
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:53,393
big foot,

2752
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:54,081
you know,

2753
01:09:54,081 --> 01:09:57,170
and cherry to the gods
and everything was so new.

2754
01:09:57,390 --> 01:09:58,250
It look at this image,

2755
01:09:58,580 --> 01:09:59,510
look at the bottom of it.

2756
01:09:59,511 --> 01:10:02,180
Even the part where the flame supposed
to be coming out from below him.

2757
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:04,423
Where's the flame?

2758
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:06,140
The flame is the shit.

2759
01:10:06,141 --> 01:10:06,621
The very,

2760
01:10:06,621 --> 01:10:07,520
very bottom.

2761
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:08,121
But I mean,

2762
01:10:08,121 --> 01:10:09,740
I'm not even sure I buy that.

2763
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:11,690
If you were going to draw fire,

2764
01:10:11,691 --> 01:10:13,010
you do a really shitty job.

2765
01:10:13,011 --> 01:10:13,860
If that's your fire,

2766
01:10:13,861 --> 01:10:15,350
that doesn't really look like fire to me.

2767
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:16,910
Like it could be anything.

2768
01:10:18,050 --> 01:10:18,883
Right?

2769
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:19,251
Right.

2770
01:10:19,251 --> 01:10:19,381
If,

2771
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:20,570
if that's fire,

2772
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:22,490
like what is all the stuff around them?

2773
01:10:22,550 --> 01:10:23,420
What's all that stuff?

2774
01:10:23,421 --> 01:10:25,040
Is that that looked kind
of mechanical though,

2775
01:10:25,041 --> 01:10:25,251
right?

2776
01:10:25,251 --> 01:10:26,750
It looks like there's bolts does,

2777
01:10:26,970 --> 01:10:27,830
if they have a fire,

2778
01:10:27,831 --> 01:10:29,210
God maybe they drew the fire.

2779
01:10:29,210 --> 01:10:30,043
God,

2780
01:10:30,140 --> 01:10:32,720
it looks like a monkey
kind of face with titties.

2781
01:10:32,780 --> 01:10:33,980
Monkey's got some titties.

2782
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:34,251
Oh,

2783
01:10:34,251 --> 01:10:34,940
now I get it.

2784
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:35,420
Right.

2785
01:10:35,420 --> 01:10:36,253
And then the monkeys,

2786
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:37,310
is that his teeth?

2787
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:39,620
It's the first tutors arms actually.

2788
01:10:39,650 --> 01:10:40,340
Right?

2789
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:40,760
It does.

2790
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:41,593
It could be armed.

2791
01:10:41,690 --> 01:10:45,290
But that's the point is it's
so open to interpretation.

2792
01:10:45,291 --> 01:10:48,500
There's so much that you could
see if you're looking to see,

2793
01:10:48,501 --> 01:10:51,410
but what I do see is this guy who's,

2794
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:55,880
he's reclining and chilling and it looks
like he's looking through something.

2795
01:10:56,060 --> 01:10:58,040
What's that thing hanging across him?

2796
01:10:58,400 --> 01:10:59,690
You see that thing across his arm.

2797
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:01,350
You know what the fuck that is.

2798
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:03,170
But here's the thing.

2799
01:11:03,171 --> 01:11:04,970
I don't think anybody knows
what the fuck that is.

2800
01:11:05,450 --> 01:11:05,601
But,

2801
01:11:05,601 --> 01:11:10,601
so for him to say that this was the
number one most compelling evidence,

2802
01:11:10,790 --> 01:11:10,971
I mean,

2803
01:11:10,971 --> 01:11:12,320
where people getting high at this point.

2804
01:11:12,620 --> 01:11:13,170
Oh,

2805
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:17,160
so I'm in that could be just some
guy got high and LSD carve something.

2806
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:17,461
Yeah,

2807
01:11:17,461 --> 01:11:17,760
they were,

2808
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:18,161
they were,

2809
01:11:18,161 --> 01:11:18,630
um,

2810
01:11:18,630 --> 01:11:21,630
taking different kinds of
plants that have like search,

2811
01:11:21,631 --> 01:11:22,464
like acid in them.

2812
01:11:23,010 --> 01:11:23,670
There was a,

2813
01:11:23,670 --> 01:11:25,320
I had a great tour,

2814
01:11:25,590 --> 01:11:26,010
um,

2815
01:11:26,010 --> 01:11:28,140
in teaching Eatsa we,

2816
01:11:28,141 --> 01:11:28,471
uh,

2817
01:11:28,471 --> 01:11:33,180
went through and we hired a guide who
was a professor who was fantastic.

2818
01:11:33,181 --> 01:11:34,200
It was really good.

2819
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:34,980
He was,

2820
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:39,000
he was really loved Mayan civilization
is super passionate about it.

2821
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:41,640
And then when he found out that I'd read
a bunch of books on and he was really

2822
01:11:41,641 --> 01:11:42,331
excited about it.

2823
01:11:42,331 --> 01:11:43,260
So he took us to these,

2824
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:44,850
all these different areas.

2825
01:11:44,851 --> 01:11:47,280
But there was one area
where they had this like,

2826
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:49,830
like hall where they
would just get fucked up.

2827
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:50,641
And he was like,

2828
01:11:50,641 --> 01:11:51,000
this is,

2829
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,230
this is where they would do their,

2830
01:11:52,231 --> 01:11:53,280
their psychedelics.

2831
01:11:53,870 --> 01:11:56,190
They would take different forms of plants.

2832
01:11:56,370 --> 01:11:59,490
There's a bunch of different
plants like a morning glory seeds.

2833
01:11:59,610 --> 01:12:00,001
Really?

2834
01:12:00,001 --> 01:12:00,211
Yeah.

2835
01:12:00,211 --> 01:12:01,470
Morning glory seeds.

2836
01:12:01,470 --> 01:12:02,670
The same ones you find today.

2837
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:03,450
Yeah.

2838
01:12:03,450 --> 01:12:05,040
They actually try to mute them.

2839
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:10,280
A lot of people don't know that morning
glory seeds actually contain what is the

2840
01:12:10,771 --> 01:12:11,730
active compound?

2841
01:12:11,731 --> 01:12:14,370
I think it's a cousin of LSD.

2842
01:12:14,910 --> 01:12:15,241
It's,

2843
01:12:15,241 --> 01:12:18,330
it's something psychoactive
that's very closely related.

2844
01:12:18,510 --> 01:12:20,400
And what you would do would
do is they would make it,

2845
01:12:20,430 --> 01:12:21,660
they would take the morning glory seeds.

2846
01:12:21,661 --> 01:12:22,410
They would,

2847
01:12:22,410 --> 01:12:27,270
they would soak them and I think they
would smash them and make a cake and bake

2848
01:12:27,271 --> 01:12:27,590
it.

2849
01:12:27,590 --> 01:12:29,460
So they have Lsa ls,

2850
01:12:29,461 --> 01:12:31,410
Lsa less surgical acid.

2851
01:12:31,411 --> 01:12:31,621
Right.

2852
01:12:31,621 --> 01:12:32,321
Is that lower surgery?

2853
01:12:32,321 --> 01:12:33,600
Casad concentrated.

2854
01:12:33,870 --> 01:12:34,200
Wow.

2855
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:34,830
Yeah.

2856
01:12:34,830 --> 01:12:35,460
And uh,

2857
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:37,280
so when you fly this,

2858
01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:39,950
they've engineered morning glory seeds.

2859
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:43,320
Many of them to not be is psychoactive.

2860
01:12:43,590 --> 01:12:47,850
They've done things to them because a lot
of people in the 70s were getting high

2861
01:12:47,851 --> 01:12:49,140
off morning glory seeds.

2862
01:12:49,230 --> 01:12:49,411
Oh,

2863
01:12:49,411 --> 01:12:50,100
isn't that funny?

2864
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:50,341
Yeah.

2865
01:12:50,341 --> 01:12:51,420
Terence Mckenna,

2866
01:12:51,870 --> 01:12:54,390
who's one of my favorite
psychedelic authors,

2867
01:12:54,450 --> 01:12:57,390
that was his first psychedelic
trip who was a young band.

2868
01:12:57,750 --> 01:12:59,070
He ate morning glory seeds.

2869
01:12:59,071 --> 01:13:00,780
He bought them and smashed them up.

2870
01:13:00,781 --> 01:13:03,310
Teens trying to get high sick
and after eating flowers,

2871
01:13:03,311 --> 01:13:04,144
seeds

2872
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:06,630
today show what years that,

2873
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:07,493
that's so funny.

2874
01:13:08,370 --> 01:13:09,780
Oh yeah.

2875
01:13:09,810 --> 01:13:10,730
They bought flowers.

2876
01:13:10,731 --> 01:13:11,580
Seeds recently.

2877
01:13:11,610 --> 01:13:12,840
They've probably heard me talk about it.

2878
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:13,681
Oh,

2879
01:13:13,681 --> 01:13:14,890
that's baby rose.

2880
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:16,560
That's a funny morning.

2881
01:13:16,561 --> 01:13:16,891
Glory.

2882
01:13:16,891 --> 01:13:17,131
Yeah.

2883
01:13:17,131 --> 01:13:17,341
Okay.

2884
01:13:17,341 --> 01:13:18,390
Those are morning glory ones.

2885
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:19,260
Um,

2886
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:19,740
yeah,

2887
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:20,573
but see,

2888
01:13:20,850 --> 01:13:21,930
smoking banana peels,

2889
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:23,790
I don't know why they're getting sick.

2890
01:13:24,330 --> 01:13:25,320
They're probably pussies.

2891
01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:26,880
Too many little bitches.

2892
01:13:27,090 --> 01:13:27,660
Uh,

2893
01:13:27,660 --> 01:13:31,080
apparently these seeds contain
[inaudible] surgical acid,

2894
01:13:31,290 --> 01:13:32,730
[inaudible] LSA,

2895
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,500
which closely resembles LSD.

2896
01:13:34,770 --> 01:13:37,140
But see all of them don't have that.

2897
01:13:37,141 --> 01:13:37,351
No one.

2898
01:13:37,351 --> 01:13:39,810
They say they got sick with vomiting.

2899
01:13:40,010 --> 01:13:40,191
Oh,

2900
01:13:40,191 --> 01:13:40,870
they had a bad trip.

2901
01:13:40,870 --> 01:13:41,820
And introspection.

2902
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:44,940
Introspection is sickening.

2903
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:45,833
Yeah,

2904
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:47,190
that's the worst part.

2905
01:13:49,170 --> 01:13:49,591
But yeah,

2906
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:51,870
apparently that's how a lot of the Mayans,

2907
01:13:51,950 --> 01:13:54,870
a lot of the Mayans used to take Lsa.

2908
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:56,370
They used to take this stuff.

2909
01:13:56,370 --> 01:13:59,790
They used to take morning glory seeds
and Mckenna said that when he did it,

2910
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:02,260
he saw a lot of uh,

2911
01:14:02,380 --> 01:14:02,730
uh,

2912
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:06,540
like classic Mayan iconography.

2913
01:14:06,570 --> 01:14:10,020
He saw like a lot of imagery till maybe
that's just how it reacts with the

2914
01:14:10,021 --> 01:14:10,590
brain.

2915
01:14:10,590 --> 01:14:11,720
It could a,

2916
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:12,520
there's sauce.

2917
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:12,820
There's,

2918
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:14,710
that's a really plausible theory.

2919
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:18,480
There's another theory that's a little
more slippery and this one is a very woo

2920
01:14:18,481 --> 01:14:19,000
woo.

2921
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:22,000
And the idea is that every
experience that you have,

2922
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:24,160
like say if you take mushrooms,

2923
01:14:24,190 --> 01:14:25,023
right,

2924
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:25,451
every,

2925
01:14:25,451 --> 01:14:26,710
when you're eating mushrooms,

2926
01:14:26,711 --> 01:14:30,600
you're not just having an experience
where your brain is interacting with the

2927
01:14:30,601 --> 01:14:31,181
substance,

2928
01:14:31,181 --> 01:14:36,181
but you are in fact experiencing all
of the people that have ever interacted

2929
01:14:37,391 --> 01:14:38,440
with this trip.

2930
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:39,601
So that,

2931
01:14:39,601 --> 01:14:43,360
that's one of the reasons why silicide
been is so potentially potent,

2932
01:14:43,660 --> 01:14:45,640
is that you're not just accessing,

2933
01:14:45,641 --> 01:14:47,500
we're talking about morning glory seeds.

2934
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:47,801
Oh,

2935
01:14:47,801 --> 01:14:48,280
right.

2936
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:51,490
And other people getting high on morning
glory seeds and this was something that

2937
01:14:51,491 --> 01:14:52,324
the Mayans did.

2938
01:14:52,390 --> 01:14:52,810
We,

2939
01:14:52,810 --> 01:14:54,370
I remember we did that
when I was in high school.

2940
01:14:54,380 --> 01:14:54,580
Wow.

2941
01:14:54,580 --> 01:14:55,410
There you go.

2942
01:14:55,410 --> 01:14:55,900
Um,

2943
01:14:55,900 --> 01:14:58,380
but their exit lanes lot the thought will,

2944
01:14:58,390 --> 01:15:00,340
the Mckenna was saying
that when he did it,

2945
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:01,600
he saw all this,

2946
01:15:01,601 --> 01:15:02,020
uh,

2947
01:15:02,020 --> 01:15:07,020
I think he said either mine or a gypsum
iconography saw a lot of like images

2948
01:15:07,451 --> 01:15:10,660
that were very similar to like
these ancient civilizations.

2949
01:15:10,661 --> 01:15:14,770
And the thought is that either this is
what's it's doing to your brain or the

2950
01:15:14,771 --> 01:15:19,360
more woo woo thought is that when you
are having a psychedelic experience,

2951
01:15:19,570 --> 01:15:22,000
especially when you're consuming
something like a fungus,

2952
01:15:22,001 --> 01:15:23,260
like a psilocybin,

2953
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:27,190
that you're not just having
this experience where
this chemicals interacting

2954
01:15:27,191 --> 01:15:28,024
with your brain,

2955
01:15:28,030 --> 01:15:31,690
but you're entering into the realm of
all the previous experiences that human

2956
01:15:31,691 --> 01:15:32,590
beings have had with this,

2957
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:37,330
which is one of the reasons why
silicide and has such a rich history.

2958
01:15:37,570 --> 01:15:37,931
Uh,

2959
01:15:37,931 --> 01:15:38,290
and,

2960
01:15:38,290 --> 01:15:38,470
uh,

2961
01:15:38,470 --> 01:15:41,860
these are incredibly potent experiences
when you do take psilocybin.

2962
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:47,100
And then also Iowasca I lost when you
take that people see Jaguars and snakes

2963
01:15:49,511 --> 01:15:50,410
and all these different things.

2964
01:15:50,590 --> 01:15:53,710
And so the thought behind that is
that you are interacting with all the

2965
01:15:53,711 --> 01:15:56,890
experiences that all these different
people have had with these,

2966
01:15:56,891 --> 01:15:58,840
with these various substances.

2967
01:15:58,870 --> 01:15:59,141
Is it,

2968
01:15:59,141 --> 01:16:00,880
what's genetic inside you?

2969
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:01,490
Like,

2970
01:16:01,490 --> 01:16:02,410
I mean,

2971
01:16:02,411 --> 01:16:03,050
who knows?

2972
01:16:03,050 --> 01:16:03,270
I mean,

2973
01:16:03,270 --> 01:16:04,103
it's all just stored.

2974
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:04,570
Yeah.

2975
01:16:04,570 --> 01:16:06,190
That's all just speculating.

2976
01:16:06,191 --> 01:16:08,860
But that what's interesting
is that Mckenna said that,

2977
01:16:09,170 --> 01:16:09,790
um,

2978
01:16:09,790 --> 01:16:10,623
ketamine,

2979
01:16:10,660 --> 01:16:12,520
which at the time when he was alive,

2980
01:16:12,521 --> 01:16:13,420
he died in the early,

2981
01:16:13,660 --> 01:16:14,890
I think early two thousands.

2982
01:16:14,891 --> 01:16:15,724
Right?

2983
01:16:16,030 --> 01:16:18,250
I think he died like early two thousands,

2984
01:16:18,690 --> 01:16:19,390
um,

2985
01:16:19,390 --> 01:16:24,310
that ketamine was a weird drug to take
cause it seemed like no one had taken it

2986
01:16:24,311 --> 01:16:27,970
yet that you would take it and it's like
you were in an empty office building.

2987
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:30,190
Like it's all built but
there's no one in the building.

2988
01:16:30,730 --> 01:16:34,920
Whereas if you're taking LSD
or if you're taking psilocybin,

2989
01:16:34,930 --> 01:16:35,410
you've this,

2990
01:16:35,410 --> 01:16:37,900
all these experiences that people had.

2991
01:16:37,901 --> 01:16:42,901
So it's like the drug itself or the
compound itself absorbs the experiences of

2992
01:16:43,601 --> 01:16:46,180
the user and transfers
them to the next users.

2993
01:16:47,130 --> 01:16:47,581
Very,

2994
01:16:47,581 --> 01:16:48,790
we will buy this.

2995
01:16:48,791 --> 01:16:49,900
I like that idea though.

2996
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:50,260
Yeah.

2997
01:16:50,260 --> 01:16:53,790
You do something that's as
potent is like silicide and you,

2998
01:16:53,791 --> 01:16:55,510
you're open a fucking anything.

2999
01:16:55,750 --> 01:16:56,920
Like if that's possible,

3000
01:16:56,921 --> 01:17:00,350
if you can eat five grams of mushrooms
and that happens like Goddamn it,

3001
01:17:00,351 --> 01:17:00,501
I'll,

3002
01:17:00,501 --> 01:17:01,450
I'll take whatever you got.

3003
01:17:01,451 --> 01:17:02,260
What else you got?

3004
01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:03,093
What else do you tell me?

3005
01:17:03,370 --> 01:17:04,420
I don't know what the fuck this is.

3006
01:17:04,421 --> 01:17:05,980
Like what is this and that's,

3007
01:17:05,981 --> 01:17:06,221
yeah.

3008
01:17:06,221 --> 01:17:06,470
I don't know.

3009
01:17:06,470 --> 01:17:06,561
You,

3010
01:17:06,561 --> 01:17:10,460
you talked about psilocybin can
treat intractable depression.

3011
01:17:10,490 --> 01:17:11,160
Yes.

3012
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:11,930
People take,

3013
01:17:11,930 --> 01:17:13,550
it opens up doors in your brain,

3014
01:17:13,551 --> 01:17:14,121
then you take it.

3015
01:17:14,121 --> 01:17:16,970
One will always stay close silicide trip.

3016
01:17:16,971 --> 01:17:18,020
And then for like six months,

3017
01:17:18,021 --> 01:17:19,340
their depression is completely gone.

3018
01:17:19,820 --> 01:17:20,240
And My,

3019
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:21,290
my parents had a,

3020
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:25,280
had a friend who was a
experimented on in Canada as a,

3021
01:17:25,281 --> 01:17:26,114
uh,

3022
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:27,260
with the LSD.

3023
01:17:27,980 --> 01:17:30,080
So she lost her mind eventually.

3024
01:17:30,081 --> 01:17:30,230
Yeah.

3025
01:17:30,230 --> 01:17:30,591
But,

3026
01:17:30,591 --> 01:17:31,280
uh,

3027
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:34,520
she didn't know at the
time he was in government.

3028
01:17:34,550 --> 01:17:34,940
They,

3029
01:17:34,940 --> 01:17:37,100
the CIA was experimenting on Canada,

3030
01:17:37,101 --> 01:17:38,810
on Canadians of course.

3031
01:17:38,990 --> 01:17:42,570
And she was wanting to get across
that clearcut doleful Muslin.

3032
01:17:42,580 --> 01:17:43,413
Yeah,

3033
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:44,240
that's right.

3034
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:45,320
Back then it was harder there.

3035
01:17:45,420 --> 01:17:47,180
There was a same rob.

3036
01:17:47,420 --> 01:17:47,720
Yeah.

3037
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:48,553
They couldn't get over it.

3038
01:17:48,630 --> 01:17:49,070
That's his thing.

3039
01:17:49,070 --> 01:17:49,660
They had,

3040
01:17:49,660 --> 01:17:50,960
they had the full cooperation of the,

3041
01:17:51,020 --> 01:17:53,090
it was the defund Baker I think.

3042
01:17:53,260 --> 01:17:53,950
Yup.

3043
01:17:53,950 --> 01:17:54,910
He does know that Ted's kids,

3044
01:17:54,930 --> 01:17:56,180
NC swore the Unabomber.

3045
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:57,153
Uh,

3046
01:17:57,230 --> 01:17:58,790
I know about the beauty bumper part.

3047
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:02,080
He was a part of the lst Harvard
Studies Alessi he was in,

3048
01:18:02,190 --> 01:18:03,770
so this is kind of the same,

3049
01:18:03,771 --> 01:18:04,130
uh,

3050
01:18:04,130 --> 01:18:04,730
same deal.

3051
01:18:04,730 --> 01:18:05,000
Yeah.

3052
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,170
They cooked that guy's brain.

3053
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:06,410
Yup.

3054
01:18:06,410 --> 01:18:06,921
Yeah.

3055
01:18:06,921 --> 01:18:07,461
There's a,

3056
01:18:07,461 --> 01:18:08,750
there's a documentary about it.

3057
01:18:08,751 --> 01:18:09,620
It's really interesting.

3058
01:18:09,621 --> 01:18:14,240
He was like a 16 year old kid when he
first went to Harvard because he was so

3059
01:18:14,241 --> 01:18:16,160
fucking smart that uh,

3060
01:18:16,190 --> 01:18:16,650
he,

3061
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:20,680
it was entering to Harvard
at 16 years of age and um,

3062
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:23,240
there was a psychologist that,

3063
01:18:23,250 --> 01:18:23,630
uh,

3064
01:18:23,630 --> 01:18:27,350
was working at Harvard
at the time that he is,

3065
01:18:27,830 --> 01:18:30,890
he's been photograph with and was
friends with and he was a part of this

3066
01:18:30,891 --> 01:18:31,280
program.

3067
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:36,280
This guy was notoriously ruthless with
his application of Lsd to young people.

3068
01:18:37,401 --> 01:18:37,581
I mean,

3069
01:18:37,581 --> 01:18:38,720
he just gave it a shot.

3070
01:18:38,750 --> 01:18:39,940
Let's see what it does,

3071
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:41,030
fries them forever.

3072
01:18:41,870 --> 01:18:42,740
But here's the thing,

3073
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:44,720
and I've been thinking
about this a lot lately.

3074
01:18:45,350 --> 01:18:47,510
I think that he was on to something,

3075
01:18:47,930 --> 01:18:49,890
and this is what he was
on to what he was onto.

3076
01:18:49,910 --> 01:18:53,180
He was trying to kill people that were
creating technology because he felt like

3077
01:18:53,181 --> 01:18:55,280
technology is going to
be the end of humans.

3078
01:18:55,310 --> 01:18:55,940
He's right.

3079
01:18:55,940 --> 01:18:56,773
He's right.

3080
01:18:56,980 --> 01:18:57,600
Yeah,

3081
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:58,433
right.

3082
01:18:59,410 --> 01:18:59,750
Yeah.

3083
01:18:59,750 --> 01:18:59,900
No,

3084
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:00,733
no.

3085
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:02,920
Definitely as fuck on acid.

3086
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:06,170
Then probably gave him a fucking
coffee cup full of acid at 16.

3087
01:19:06,210 --> 01:19:06,440
Yeah.

3088
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:07,670
I mean who knows how much they were.

3089
01:19:07,671 --> 01:19:09,380
They didn't know what the doses were.

3090
01:19:09,530 --> 01:19:11,060
They were just experimenting with people.

3091
01:19:11,090 --> 01:19:11,280
Cause I,

3092
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,520
Ken Keyes leary role part of that.

3093
01:19:13,521 --> 01:19:14,300
Exactly.

3094
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:14,481
Yeah.

3095
01:19:14,481 --> 01:19:15,141
A few weeks ago,

3096
01:19:15,141 --> 01:19:17,690
and I read an article online
and at the bottom it said,

3097
01:19:17,691 --> 01:19:19,330
this article has been written by a,

3098
01:19:19,331 --> 01:19:20,164
a program,

3099
01:19:20,630 --> 01:19:21,440
not by human.

3100
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:22,030
Oh yeah,

3101
01:19:22,030 --> 01:19:22,230
yeah.

3102
01:19:22,230 --> 01:19:22,790
I was like,

3103
01:19:22,790 --> 01:19:23,240
what?

3104
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:23,720
Yeah.

3105
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:24,820
I arts paint,

3106
01:19:24,890 --> 01:19:25,723
paintings,

3107
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:27,380
paintings done by Ai.

3108
01:19:27,710 --> 01:19:29,090
Like a symphony.

3109
01:19:29,091 --> 01:19:29,241
No,

3110
01:19:29,241 --> 01:19:30,910
he lives in Bombay on what's happening.

3111
01:19:31,130 --> 01:19:31,620
It's,

3112
01:19:31,620 --> 01:19:32,720
it's coming in it now.

3113
01:19:33,230 --> 01:19:37,700
Once they figure out a way to make a
reality that's indiscernible from the

3114
01:19:37,701 --> 01:19:39,170
reality that we're currently experiencing,

3115
01:19:39,171 --> 01:19:40,004
which is just,

3116
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:41,180
it's around the corner.

3117
01:19:41,210 --> 01:19:41,351
Yeah.

3118
01:19:41,351 --> 01:19:42,184
That's only like,

3119
01:19:42,230 --> 01:19:46,220
or happened 2 billion years ago
and we're just living in it.

3120
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:48,590
Only know what's in front of you.

3121
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:49,731
And you know what I mean?

3122
01:19:49,731 --> 01:19:50,010
Sure.

3123
01:19:50,010 --> 01:19:50,100
Well,

3124
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:50,900
yeah,

3125
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:52,040
and if you've done the,

3126
01:19:52,130 --> 01:19:52,551
you know,

3127
01:19:52,551 --> 01:19:53,384
the,

3128
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:54,351
you know,

3129
01:19:54,351 --> 01:19:54,711
what is it,

3130
01:19:54,711 --> 01:19:56,210
the oculus stuff and all that.

3131
01:19:57,270 --> 01:20:00,470
I mean we have a HTC vive
and the back and see hazing.

3132
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:01,280
Right?

3133
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:01,510
Yeah.

3134
01:20:01,510 --> 01:20:02,150
It's amazing.

3135
01:20:02,150 --> 01:20:03,290
But your emotions,

3136
01:20:03,291 --> 01:20:04,124
everything,

3137
01:20:04,130 --> 01:20:04,963
it's like you're there.

3138
01:20:05,060 --> 01:20:05,893
It's no different.

3139
01:20:06,070 --> 01:20:06,620
Yeah.

3140
01:20:06,620 --> 01:20:07,361
It's very similar.

3141
01:20:07,361 --> 01:20:08,850
There's one where you jump off a building.

3142
01:20:08,851 --> 01:20:09,780
Have you ever tried that one?

3143
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:10,290
No.

3144
01:20:10,290 --> 01:20:14,700
You go out in the diving board
and a on a high rise and step off.

3145
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:15,151
Yeah,

3146
01:20:15,151 --> 01:20:15,600
well they are.

3147
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:17,660
They're using it to treat PTSD

3148
01:20:19,460 --> 01:20:20,293
and

3149
01:20:22,170 --> 01:20:24,020
it's going to happen yet.

3150
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:29,130
Once they figure out a way to give you
some experiences that you can't tell

3151
01:20:29,131 --> 01:20:31,020
whether or not those
experiences or were real or not,

3152
01:20:31,290 --> 01:20:32,970
then the aliens or feel they'll,

3153
01:20:33,150 --> 01:20:35,580
they'll land and they'll interact.

3154
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:37,110
It is really is the matrix,

3155
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:42,260
but I think that artificial life and art
and an intelligence that is sentient,

3156
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:45,030
that is also completely autonomous,

3157
01:20:45,031 --> 01:20:46,830
that can run itself and decide for itself.

3158
01:20:47,190 --> 01:20:48,630
It's only a matter of time.

3159
01:20:49,170 --> 01:20:50,310
It's not a matter of,

3160
01:20:50,510 --> 01:20:54,510
this is not like hg wells
science fiction 200 years ago.

3161
01:20:54,511 --> 01:20:55,530
Like we're just guessing.

3162
01:20:56,340 --> 01:20:57,720
This is like you could see it coming.

3163
01:20:57,750 --> 01:20:58,350
Yeah.

3164
01:20:58,350 --> 01:20:59,910
They already have machine learning.

3165
01:21:00,030 --> 01:21:03,900
They already have certain artificial
intelligence that guesses certain things

3166
01:21:03,901 --> 01:21:04,950
about you and,

3167
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:07,260
but Siri is still a dumb cunt.

3168
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:08,941
What's better?

3169
01:21:08,941 --> 01:21:09,500
Big Spear.

3170
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:10,930
Siri tried Bixby.

3171
01:21:11,650 --> 01:21:14,790
Is Samsung's version of Siri yet?

3172
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:16,440
Like A,

3173
01:21:16,441 --> 01:21:17,110
I don't know.

3174
01:21:17,110 --> 01:21:17,530
That's all.

3175
01:21:17,530 --> 01:21:18,151
Never use it.

3176
01:21:18,151 --> 01:21:19,210
I have a sense on the phone.

3177
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:20,040
I don't know.

3178
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:21,180
It's incredibly effective yet,

3179
01:21:21,181 --> 01:21:22,020
but it has a terrible voice.

3180
01:21:22,270 --> 01:21:25,140
Kept that button to map
it out to anything else.

3181
01:21:25,170 --> 01:21:26,580
Is it the voice of Bill Beck speak?

3182
01:21:26,581 --> 01:21:27,430
Cause that'd be really cool.

3183
01:21:27,431 --> 01:21:27,781
All right.

3184
01:21:27,781 --> 01:21:30,690
From the Hawk or courtship
of Eddie's father

3185
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:36,110
tell you about this fan is it can pick,

3186
01:21:36,150 --> 01:21:36,451
get you.

3187
01:21:36,451 --> 01:21:37,284
I'd never

3188
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:43,170
utility and did the end forgot about that.

3189
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:43,441
Yeah.

3190
01:21:43,441 --> 01:21:46,170
And he had that hot Japanese
lady that was his housekeeper,

3191
01:21:46,380 --> 01:21:46,960
but he never,

3192
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:47,220
uh,

3193
01:21:47,220 --> 01:21:47,821
hooked up with her.

3194
01:21:47,821 --> 01:21:48,121
I was like,

3195
01:21:48,121 --> 01:21:48,451
come on.

3196
01:21:48,451 --> 01:21:49,560
She's right there bro.

3197
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:50,910
She seems real nice.

3198
01:21:50,911 --> 01:21:51,270
True.

3199
01:21:51,270 --> 01:21:52,560
She seems lonely too.

3200
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:56,520
Seeing what's right in front of you.

3201
01:21:56,521 --> 01:21:57,060
Didn't get it.

3202
01:21:57,060 --> 01:21:57,301
I'm like,

3203
01:21:57,301 --> 01:21:58,530
how will you not with her man?

3204
01:21:58,531 --> 01:21:59,970
She's so nice to your kid.

3205
01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:01,740
You guys are biggest sweet family.

3206
01:22:03,020 --> 01:22:03,640
Very Long.

3207
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:04,473
You know,

3208
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,690
maybe if he'd gotten like
five or six more seasons,

3209
01:22:06,770 --> 01:22:08,100
whoever is on Netflix or something.

3210
01:22:08,101 --> 01:22:08,460
Yeah,

3211
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:09,480
it would have pushed that angle.

3212
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:10,140
Yeah.

3213
01:22:10,140 --> 01:22:12,240
I started watching a
magician a little bit.

3214
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:13,340
You've seen that?

3215
01:22:13,340 --> 01:22:14,200
What does that speak show?

3216
01:22:14,510 --> 01:22:15,570
Oh God.

3217
01:22:15,630 --> 01:22:16,330
What is it?

3218
01:22:16,330 --> 01:22:17,130
One of the worst of all,

3219
01:22:17,130 --> 01:22:20,310
it was one of the CBS movie mysteries.

3220
01:22:20,580 --> 01:22:23,930
It was like with Colombo and
was terrible on every level.

3221
01:22:24,330 --> 01:22:24,481
Yeah.

3222
01:22:24,481 --> 01:22:25,314
He was the magician.

3223
01:22:25,420 --> 01:22:28,980
He was his magic to solve crimes
would know what the Magic,

3224
01:22:29,370 --> 01:22:29,491
oh,

3225
01:22:29,491 --> 01:22:30,240
that's hilarious.

3226
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:30,630
Yeah.

3227
01:22:30,630 --> 01:22:31,920
How do you solve crimes with magic?

3228
01:22:31,921 --> 01:22:33,930
You don't do magic.

3229
01:22:33,990 --> 01:22:34,410
Yeah.

3230
01:22:34,410 --> 01:22:34,800
Oh,

3231
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:37,080
and you pretend you're solving crimes
and then someone else solves a crime.

3232
01:22:37,110 --> 01:22:37,280
Yeah.

3233
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:38,550
It was probably a producer's idea.

3234
01:22:38,551 --> 01:22:39,150
Right.

3235
01:22:39,150 --> 01:22:39,470
It's,

3236
01:22:39,470 --> 01:22:39,660
hey,

3237
01:22:39,660 --> 01:22:40,860
I got to like match guys.

3238
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:41,950
Here's the show.

3239
01:22:41,950 --> 01:22:43,680
I'm a magician who solves crime.

3240
01:22:44,070 --> 01:22:44,903
Sell it.

3241
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:45,931
I've got another meeting,

3242
01:22:45,931 --> 01:22:47,190
I've got to go and he leaves.

3243
01:22:48,530 --> 01:22:49,363
I got to show it.

3244
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:50,850
Yeah.

3245
01:22:50,850 --> 01:22:52,110
I had a pit crews.

3246
01:22:52,170 --> 01:22:53,220
They gave me a pitch once.

3247
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:53,510
Uh,

3248
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:55,050
it was a guy who was immortal.

3249
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:56,640
He was an Egyptian.

3250
01:22:57,030 --> 01:22:58,290
This was a pitch to me.

3251
01:22:58,340 --> 01:23:00,750
It was going to play this
guy who was a mortal far.

3252
01:23:00,751 --> 01:23:01,560
It's good casting.

3253
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:01,760
Yeah.

3254
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:02,593
Mortal.

3255
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:04,100
He got,

3256
01:23:04,620 --> 01:23:05,320
yeah.

3257
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:06,220
Happened back then.

3258
01:23:06,221 --> 01:23:09,310
And a woman put a curse on me because I
was like banging her sister or something

3259
01:23:09,311 --> 01:23:10,000
like that.

3260
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:10,833
And uh,

3261
01:23:11,110 --> 01:23:13,090
the curse was that you would live forever.

3262
01:23:13,390 --> 01:23:14,860
So here I was,

3263
01:23:14,890 --> 01:23:16,270
many thousands of years later,

3264
01:23:16,271 --> 01:23:19,450
I had to pretend that I was a
regular person and I could never die.

3265
01:23:19,451 --> 01:23:20,680
And that was the Sitcom.

3266
01:23:21,020 --> 01:23:21,850
It was calm.

3267
01:23:21,850 --> 01:23:22,683
Yeah,

3268
01:23:22,870 --> 01:23:23,580
it was a sitcom.

3269
01:23:23,580 --> 01:23:25,660
It was the dumbest idea
I've ever heard in my life.

3270
01:23:25,690 --> 01:23:26,021
Great.

3271
01:23:26,021 --> 01:23:28,540
As a one hour to solve crimes,

3272
01:23:28,541 --> 01:23:28,950
because I know,

3273
01:23:28,950 --> 01:23:31,180
I knew it was going to be a problem
when I met the guy and he was wearing

3274
01:23:31,181 --> 01:23:31,811
bowling shoes,

3275
01:23:31,811 --> 01:23:32,830
but he wasn't going bowling.

3276
01:23:33,490 --> 01:23:35,880
That means ask those fuckers

3277
01:23:37,810 --> 01:23:38,643
shoes.

3278
01:23:39,250 --> 01:23:40,360
My shoes are interesting.

3279
01:23:40,730 --> 01:23:41,261
Wait a second.

3280
01:23:41,261 --> 01:23:42,094
I used to do that.

3281
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:44,201
Well,

3282
01:23:44,201 --> 01:23:46,240
do you remember when there
was the writer teams,

3283
01:23:46,270 --> 01:23:48,730
but it was always the one guy who was
the typer and the other guy was really

3284
01:23:48,910 --> 01:23:49,560
funny.

3285
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:50,230
Yeah.

3286
01:23:50,230 --> 01:23:54,040
There was a lot of those teams and those
teams would branch off and one of those

3287
01:23:54,041 --> 01:23:56,260
guys would get a lot
of money and then the,

3288
01:23:56,261 --> 01:23:56,770
you know,

3289
01:23:56,770 --> 01:23:59,730
they were the time you got the wrong guy,

3290
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:02,073
paid the fucking,

3291
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:02,700
oh,

3292
01:24:02,700 --> 01:24:03,610
we paid the typer.

3293
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:05,320
There was a lot of that with the teams.

3294
01:24:05,321 --> 01:24:09,370
The teams always seem to
be like one really talented
person who's kind of may be

3295
01:24:09,371 --> 01:24:10,750
introspective and weird.

3296
01:24:10,751 --> 01:24:11,890
And I eventually figured out,

3297
01:24:11,891 --> 01:24:12,011
oh,

3298
01:24:12,011 --> 01:24:15,460
I can just hire a typist
and he got rid of that guy.

3299
01:24:15,461 --> 01:24:16,900
But then that guy got
a big development deal.

3300
01:24:18,430 --> 01:24:19,420
Remember development deals.

3301
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:19,991
Oh my God,

3302
01:24:19,991 --> 01:24:20,860
I had so many of them.

3303
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:27,940
I had one one year where they gave me
a shit ton of money and we never did

3304
01:24:27,970 --> 01:24:28,803
anything.

3305
01:24:29,470 --> 01:24:31,480
All the money I had three months,

3306
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:33,760
I had about four right after news radio.

3307
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:34,260
Did you?

3308
01:24:34,260 --> 01:24:35,093
Yeah.

3309
01:24:35,140 --> 01:24:38,110
And they create smaller and
smaller networks each time.

3310
01:24:38,650 --> 01:24:38,881
Yeah.

3311
01:24:38,881 --> 01:24:39,070
Right.

3312
01:24:39,070 --> 01:24:40,120
You get down to the CW,

3313
01:24:40,121 --> 01:24:41,020
you know you've got an issue.

3314
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:42,700
I might have to actually write something.

3315
01:24:42,740 --> 01:24:43,490
No,

3316
01:24:43,490 --> 01:24:44,590
no cooking channel.

3317
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,750
So what is this obsessing?

3318
01:24:46,780 --> 01:24:48,080
What is your,

3319
01:24:48,110 --> 01:24:51,070
your more recent obsessing about Ufo was,

3320
01:24:51,071 --> 01:24:52,060
what's the origin of this?

3321
01:24:53,470 --> 01:24:57,220
Part of it is just the fact
that that the evidence,

3322
01:24:57,310 --> 01:25:01,180
just the evidence itself says you have
to take this seriously and yet no one

3323
01:25:01,181 --> 01:25:03,130
does a or very,

3324
01:25:03,131 --> 01:25:03,881
very few people do.

3325
01:25:03,881 --> 01:25:05,680
And even like the,

3326
01:25:05,860 --> 01:25:09,640
again that [inaudible] 16 footage that
even Neil degrasse Tyson who is a great

3327
01:25:09,641 --> 01:25:11,200
skeptic said,

3328
01:25:11,290 --> 01:25:12,123
uh,

3329
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:13,510
on one of the late nights actually,

3330
01:25:13,540 --> 01:25:13,751
he said,

3331
01:25:13,751 --> 01:25:13,841
well,

3332
01:25:13,841 --> 01:25:16,810
if you really want to look
at the possibility of some,

3333
01:25:17,230 --> 01:25:18,760
a non human intelligence,

3334
01:25:18,761 --> 01:25:21,460
that f 16 stuff is pretty compelling.

3335
01:25:21,790 --> 01:25:24,010
What is the episode STD stuff?

3336
01:25:24,190 --> 01:25:24,961
That's the stuff that,

3337
01:25:24,961 --> 01:25:25,360
uh,

3338
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:26,800
to the stars academy put out.

3339
01:25:26,801 --> 01:25:28,660
It was the CIA Tom Delonge.

3340
01:25:29,050 --> 01:25:29,883
He's crazy,

3341
01:25:30,030 --> 01:25:31,540
but I had never met on the podcast.

3342
01:25:32,020 --> 01:25:32,630
Yeah,

3343
01:25:32,630 --> 01:25:33,700
very nice guy.

3344
01:25:33,910 --> 01:25:34,360
What do you see?

3345
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:38,140
And he said she's a very nice guy and
a brilliant musician and he's a loon.

3346
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:38,830
Yeah.

3347
01:25:38,830 --> 01:25:41,440
I've never met a fucking full on believer.

3348
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:45,940
I mean he left blink one 82 to
go do this to the stars academy.

3349
01:25:45,941 --> 01:25:46,181
Shit,

3350
01:25:46,181 --> 01:25:48,550
he said the biggest Goddamn
rock band on the planet.

3351
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:49,330
Okay.

3352
01:25:49,330 --> 01:25:54,330
Here's something interesting about
this and this was pointed out like by,

3353
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:55,913
um,

3354
01:25:56,140 --> 01:25:56,501
okay.

3355
01:25:56,501 --> 01:26:01,000
A film video film by fighter jet shows
an unknown object near San Diego video

3356
01:26:01,001 --> 01:26:03,860
from 2004 was released by
the US Department of Defense.

3357
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:05,473
Um,

3358
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:07,370
while the way it moves,

3359
01:26:07,850 --> 01:26:10,100
there's something about the
way it moves is really weird.

3360
01:26:10,101 --> 01:26:10,520
Huh?

3361
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:11,590
Can't yet though.

3362
01:26:12,690 --> 01:26:15,620
One of the pilots told the you immediate
the object was not from this world.

3363
01:26:15,910 --> 01:26:16,460
Hmm.

3364
01:26:16,460 --> 01:26:17,030
Yeah.

3365
01:26:17,030 --> 01:26:17,541
And here's the thing.

3366
01:26:17,541 --> 01:26:18,291
It's like the skeptics,

3367
01:26:18,291 --> 01:26:19,580
in order to dismiss it,

3368
01:26:19,581 --> 01:26:21,070
they have to go well event.

3369
01:26:21,110 --> 01:26:22,820
They have to make arguments like that.

3370
01:26:22,821 --> 01:26:25,880
Jet Fighters are not better
observers than anyone else.

3371
01:26:25,910 --> 01:26:29,120
Pull up Mick wards take on that mic ward,

3372
01:26:29,121 --> 01:26:30,770
the guy who he runs deep,

3373
01:26:30,860 --> 01:26:31,410
um,

3374
01:26:31,410 --> 01:26:31,670
uh,

3375
01:26:31,670 --> 01:26:32,131
what does it met?

3376
01:26:32,131 --> 01:26:36,800
A bunk metabolic can runs a debunking
site and he's another one of those guys

3377
01:26:36,801 --> 01:26:38,930
that is all in with the,

3378
01:26:40,430 --> 01:26:45,200
the conventional explanation goes way
out of his way to not look at anything

3379
01:26:45,201 --> 01:26:47,580
that could be blockers.

3380
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:48,471
Yes,

3381
01:26:48,471 --> 01:26:48,830
yes.

3382
01:26:48,830 --> 01:26:49,760
Comes Razor says,

3383
01:26:50,450 --> 01:26:54,620
you know that if you have to go to
great lengths to dismiss something,

3384
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:55,100
right,

3385
01:26:55,100 --> 01:26:55,760
that's not falling.

3386
01:26:55,760 --> 01:27:00,290
Ockham's razor Ockham's razor says
if the jet pilot says he saw this,

3387
01:27:00,291 --> 01:27:01,124
he saw it.

3388
01:27:01,190 --> 01:27:03,200
I think he had an interesting
take on it though.

3389
01:27:03,201 --> 01:27:07,640
And one of the things is there's a time
during the video where the pilot shifted

3390
01:27:07,641 --> 01:27:09,950
from one x to two x,

3391
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:14,030
which makes the image
move more because you're,

3392
01:27:14,031 --> 01:27:15,110
you have magnification.

3393
01:27:15,111 --> 01:27:20,090
Like have you ever used magnifying
glasses by knows like if you use a 15 x by

3394
01:27:20,091 --> 01:27:22,010
knows it's very difficult
to hold in the state yet,

3395
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:22,933
but six,

3396
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:23,391
six,

3397
01:27:23,391 --> 01:27:24,920
you can kind of look at
things in the distance.

3398
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:25,670
Yeah.

3399
01:27:25,670 --> 01:27:26,031
But that's,

3400
01:27:26,031 --> 01:27:27,990
if you don't have about,

3401
01:27:27,991 --> 01:27:28,160
uh,

3402
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:32,630
about $3 million worth of stabilization
equipment on your jet walked on to this

3403
01:27:32,631 --> 01:27:33,051
object.

3404
01:27:33,051 --> 01:27:33,560
Right.

3405
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:35,330
Which is why that stays in Loc.

3406
01:27:35,540 --> 01:27:37,550
He had an explanation though
that was kind of interesting.

3407
01:27:37,580 --> 01:27:41,210
And when it breaks free of the lock
and how does that got unbelievable.

3408
01:27:41,530 --> 01:27:43,010
Just take off or something like that.

3409
01:27:43,011 --> 01:27:43,341
It just,

3410
01:27:43,341 --> 01:27:44,090
at one point just the,

3411
01:27:44,090 --> 01:27:47,900
you just breaks free the lock
and that's almost impossible.

3412
01:27:48,770 --> 01:27:52,010
I have a glide sound possible for
anything that manage bills to do what?

3413
01:27:52,011 --> 01:27:54,020
The quality of cameras today.

3414
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:56,120
Why is this footage so shitty?

3415
01:27:56,740 --> 01:27:57,410
Uh,

3416
01:27:57,410 --> 01:27:59,150
that this is infrared footage footage?

3417
01:27:59,160 --> 01:27:59,880
Yeah.

3418
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:00,011
Yeah.

3419
01:28:00,011 --> 01:28:00,231
I mean,

3420
01:28:00,231 --> 01:28:00,891
do you need this?

3421
01:28:00,891 --> 01:28:02,210
When you're shooting at things in the sky,

3422
01:28:02,211 --> 01:28:03,530
you can't rely on [inaudible].

3423
01:28:04,150 --> 01:28:05,630
When you're looking at heat,

3424
01:28:05,940 --> 01:28:07,490
you can't hate sickness visually.

3425
01:28:07,491 --> 01:28:08,180
It's so far.

3426
01:28:08,180 --> 01:28:09,350
It's so far.

3427
01:28:09,351 --> 01:28:11,150
It would be the rabbit hole.

3428
01:28:11,151 --> 01:28:13,870
How to debunk conspiracy theories
using fact logic and research.

3429
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:14,960
So what is he saying?

3430
01:28:15,590 --> 01:28:16,423
What is he saying?

3431
01:28:16,820 --> 01:28:18,380
The Program da Da.

3432
01:28:18,770 --> 01:28:20,410
Make that a little larger
for my stupid dies.

3433
01:28:20,790 --> 01:28:22,310
He said a for all.

3434
01:28:22,311 --> 01:28:24,500
We made sure you are talking
about the right video.

3435
01:28:24,501 --> 01:28:26,780
There's two that are confused here.

3436
01:28:26,780 --> 01:28:28,220
We're talking about the gimbal video,

3437
01:28:28,221 --> 01:28:30,410
which is not from the Nimitz incident.

3438
01:28:30,470 --> 01:28:31,460
Just discussed here.

3439
01:28:31,670 --> 01:28:32,720
So scroll down a little bit.

3440
01:28:34,330 --> 01:28:34,610
Uh,

3441
01:28:34,610 --> 01:28:36,860
the gimbal video is an okay.

3442
01:28:36,861 --> 01:28:37,041
Yeah,

3443
01:28:37,041 --> 01:28:37,970
that's the one we're looking at.

3444
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:41,810
It's an unknown date and location
from an up from unknown pilots.

3445
01:28:41,811 --> 01:28:42,380
Nope.

3446
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:45,200
The tick tock one are young pilots.

3447
01:28:45,230 --> 01:28:45,800
Yeah,

3448
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:46,910
that's 2004.

3449
01:28:46,911 --> 01:28:47,121
Okay.

3450
01:28:47,121 --> 01:28:48,200
That's David forever.

3451
01:28:48,201 --> 01:28:48,950
The media is discussed.

3452
01:28:48,950 --> 01:28:49,783
These videos,

3453
01:28:50,330 --> 01:28:52,040
Tom Delonge to the stars.

3454
01:28:52,130 --> 01:28:53,720
The link contains the frames.

3455
01:28:53,721 --> 01:28:54,554
What's he saying?

3456
01:28:55,190 --> 01:28:55,791
Keep going.

3457
01:28:55,791 --> 01:28:56,301
Keep going.

3458
01:28:56,301 --> 01:28:57,134
Keep going.

3459
01:28:57,350 --> 01:28:58,400
Uh,

3460
01:28:58,401 --> 01:28:59,690
the black shape or on the object.

3461
01:28:59,691 --> 01:29:02,400
Some kind of infrared flare glare.

3462
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:05,730
We know that the shape of a
very bright infrared source,

3463
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:09,690
like the engine of a plane can be
much bigger than the object itself is

3464
01:29:09,691 --> 01:29:10,200
explained here.

3465
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:10,501
Okay,

3466
01:29:10,501 --> 01:29:13,150
so this is like a flare that
that'll explain the move.

3467
01:29:13,230 --> 01:29:14,063
Yeah,

3468
01:29:14,730 --> 01:29:16,110
it doesn't explain again.

3469
01:29:16,111 --> 01:29:17,730
Ockham's razor is,

3470
01:29:18,090 --> 01:29:18,361
okay,

3471
01:29:18,361 --> 01:29:19,194
so this guy does,

3472
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:22,170
this guy is saying it
looks nothing like it.

3473
01:29:24,050 --> 01:29:24,210
Well,

3474
01:29:24,210 --> 01:29:25,230
even if it is a jet,

3475
01:29:25,270 --> 01:29:28,380
a chats not capable of
breaking free from the lock,

3476
01:29:28,381 --> 01:29:28,650
right.

3477
01:29:28,650 --> 01:29:29,461
To lock onto it.

3478
01:29:29,461 --> 01:29:30,420
And if you look at that,

3479
01:29:30,570 --> 01:29:31,800
you can see the jet,

3480
01:29:31,950 --> 01:29:33,360
his own example.

3481
01:29:33,390 --> 01:29:34,350
Debunks is debunking.

3482
01:29:35,430 --> 01:29:37,080
Need not be moving.

3483
01:29:37,150 --> 01:29:37,500
Yeah.

3484
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:38,850
The video need not be moving.

3485
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:44,320
The assumption that this guy doing
probably a few hours research has come up

3486
01:29:45,210 --> 01:29:49,950
with something that is more credible than
a trained fighter pilot who was there

3487
01:29:49,951 --> 01:29:51,000
and visually seeing it.

3488
01:29:51,060 --> 01:29:53,040
What do you think it and
tracking if you had to guess.

3489
01:29:53,340 --> 01:29:53,960
I don't know.

3490
01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:54,793
Let's get crazy.

3491
01:29:55,350 --> 01:29:56,190
I think it is.

3492
01:29:56,240 --> 01:29:56,820
It is another,

3493
01:29:56,820 --> 01:30:01,200
it is an intelligent craft is a
craft being piloted intelligently.

3494
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:02,910
Why aren't they talking to us?

3495
01:30:03,990 --> 01:30:04,890
We're fucking apes.

3496
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:05,320
Mileage.

3497
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:05,560
Yeah.

3498
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:06,750
Like go in and talk to us.

3499
01:30:06,751 --> 01:30:07,410
We're assholes.

3500
01:30:07,410 --> 01:30:08,243
When you look at it,

3501
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:10,380
I forgot.

3502
01:30:10,380 --> 01:30:10,860
You're right.

3503
01:30:10,860 --> 01:30:12,690
Leaving fucking plastic straws everywhere.

3504
01:30:13,220 --> 01:30:13,410
Oh,

3505
01:30:13,410 --> 01:30:14,040
we cured it.

3506
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:15,240
No more plastic straws.

3507
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:18,060
When you're a kid looking
at a an ant colony,

3508
01:30:18,061 --> 01:30:20,280
you didn't go listen to me aunts.

3509
01:30:20,310 --> 01:30:20,820
Yes.

3510
01:30:20,820 --> 01:30:21,690
You just looked at them.

3511
01:30:22,370 --> 01:30:23,203
You know there was,

3512
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:24,091
and they said,

3513
01:30:24,091 --> 01:30:24,201
why?

3514
01:30:24,201 --> 01:30:25,510
Why don't they go to the White House it?

3515
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:25,741
We said,

3516
01:30:25,741 --> 01:30:27,420
well why would you,

3517
01:30:27,470 --> 01:30:28,680
when you look at an ant colony go,

3518
01:30:28,681 --> 01:30:30,090
I must speak to the queen.

3519
01:30:30,670 --> 01:30:31,250
Yes.

3520
01:30:31,250 --> 01:30:31,570
No,

3521
01:30:31,570 --> 01:30:32,970
I've always said he was looking at ants.

3522
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:33,421
Yeah.

3523
01:30:33,421 --> 01:30:35,430
That's what the most
ridiculous thing about like

3524
01:30:37,020 --> 01:30:38,190
the old movies,

3525
01:30:38,490 --> 01:30:39,181
like the old movies,

3526
01:30:39,181 --> 01:30:40,530
it would land on the White House lawn.

3527
01:30:40,860 --> 01:30:41,693
Right.

3528
01:30:45,610 --> 01:30:46,443
That's still today.

3529
01:30:46,530 --> 01:30:46,980
That's it.

3530
01:30:46,980 --> 01:30:47,813
Yeah.

3531
01:30:47,830 --> 01:30:49,190
Burrata nickname,

3532
01:30:49,210 --> 01:30:49,920
whatever that thing was.

3533
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:50,670
Yeah.

3534
01:30:50,670 --> 01:30:51,540
Two burrata.

3535
01:30:51,550 --> 01:30:53,120
I'd like to talk nick too.

3536
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:53,400
Yeah,

3537
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:54,890
that's the day.

3538
01:30:54,910 --> 01:30:56,080
The are still like you said,

3539
01:30:56,220 --> 01:31:00,420
1940 or 50 50 50 50 fucking great.

3540
01:31:00,690 --> 01:31:01,523
Great movie.

3541
01:31:01,710 --> 01:31:05,880
I watched it really reasonably
cause it's a little bit right.

3542
01:31:05,881 --> 01:31:06,690
Stories are great.

3543
01:31:06,690 --> 01:31:07,690
He was a Christ pair.

3544
01:31:07,740 --> 01:31:09,120
Well his name is John Carpenter.

3545
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:10,153
Oh,

3546
01:31:10,860 --> 01:31:11,693
I see.

3547
01:31:12,100 --> 01:31:13,020
Christ was a carpenter.

3548
01:31:13,590 --> 01:31:13,980
Shoot.

3549
01:31:13,980 --> 01:31:15,030
That object out of his hand.

3550
01:31:15,031 --> 01:31:16,410
The first second he pulls it out.

3551
01:31:16,411 --> 01:31:18,300
Do remember he has that thing
that's going to cure cancer.

3552
01:31:18,330 --> 01:31:18,841
They shoot him,

3553
01:31:18,841 --> 01:31:19,674
they shoot him,

3554
01:31:20,130 --> 01:31:21,690
shoot it out of his hand and meeting him.

3555
01:31:21,930 --> 01:31:24,150
And then at the end of the movie he is a,

3556
01:31:24,180 --> 01:31:25,590
he is killed and resurrected.

3557
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:26,521
That's right.

3558
01:31:26,521 --> 01:31:26,671
Right.

3559
01:31:26,671 --> 01:31:27,060
Yeah.

3560
01:31:27,060 --> 01:31:31,430
They shoot him taking the
robot takes them the robot.

3561
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:33,690
That robot robot.

3562
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:34,110
Yeah.

3563
01:31:34,110 --> 01:31:34,943
Very tall.

3564
01:31:35,550 --> 01:31:40,090
And like he looked like you would
want a robot to look in 1950.

3565
01:31:40,180 --> 01:31:40,770
Yes.

3566
01:31:40,770 --> 01:31:41,011
Yeah.

3567
01:31:41,011 --> 01:31:43,980
All metal and shits smooth chrome.

3568
01:31:44,430 --> 01:31:44,731
Yeah.

3569
01:31:44,731 --> 01:31:45,390
Those,

3570
01:31:45,390 --> 01:31:48,840
those were the days we thought that they
would communicate like it wasn't there

3571
01:31:48,850 --> 01:31:52,320
a whole rash of them that
were seen over Washington DC.

3572
01:31:52,321 --> 01:31:52,651
Yeah,

3573
01:31:52,651 --> 01:31:53,220
there was a peer,

3574
01:31:53,220 --> 01:31:53,460
he has,

3575
01:31:53,460 --> 01:31:54,510
it was dozens,

3576
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:59,590
dozens of Ufos tracked and admitted by
the government that they tracking them

3577
01:31:59,591 --> 01:32:00,430
and watching them.

3578
01:32:00,460 --> 01:32:00,911
But they,

3579
01:32:00,911 --> 01:32:01,120
uh,

3580
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:01,620
essentially,

3581
01:32:01,620 --> 01:32:03,160
and then at the end of
their explanation was,

3582
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:03,680
yeah.

3583
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:04,150
Nothing,

3584
01:32:04,150 --> 01:32:06,130
nothing particularly important.

3585
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:06,670
You know,

3586
01:32:06,670 --> 01:32:08,740
we have a mutual friend who claims,

3587
01:32:08,860 --> 01:32:11,140
I won't say her name
but she can now cause I,

3588
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:13,530
I wrote her off as a lunatic
when I first started it.

3589
01:32:13,531 --> 01:32:13,631
Yeah.

3590
01:32:13,631 --> 01:32:17,260
Well she was claiming to
be adopted and then I,

3591
01:32:17,310 --> 01:32:20,740
I was doing a show with her years ago
and she just telling us the story.

3592
01:32:21,130 --> 01:32:21,641
We're all like a,

3593
01:32:21,641 --> 01:32:21,940
Huh,

3594
01:32:21,940 --> 01:32:22,571
that's pretty funny.

3595
01:32:22,571 --> 01:32:22,961
And she says,

3596
01:32:22,961 --> 01:32:27,130
and then they took a scoop out
of my back and I'm like a scoop.

3597
01:32:27,160 --> 01:32:31,240
They took a scoop out of your back
and she showed on her back shoulder.

3598
01:32:31,540 --> 01:32:32,890
There was a hexagon,

3599
01:32:32,891 --> 01:32:35,500
old diamond shaped scoop out of her back.

3600
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:37,330
Uh,

3601
01:32:37,330 --> 01:32:39,660
a divot that hexagon.

3602
01:32:39,940 --> 01:32:40,301
Yeah.

3603
01:32:40,301 --> 01:32:41,680
That was clearly,

3604
01:32:41,830 --> 01:32:44,020
clearly and no scar tissue.

3605
01:32:44,050 --> 01:32:45,070
Maybe she's a crazy bitch.

3606
01:32:45,071 --> 01:32:46,870
No scar tissue man know
how to make this story.

3607
01:32:47,470 --> 01:32:48,303
Yeah,

3608
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:49,510
give myself a little punch,

3609
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:51,150
but I have a hole punch back there.

3610
01:32:51,610 --> 01:32:55,810
Worked at a bookstore at the time years
ago when I went into the alien section

3611
01:32:55,811 --> 01:32:57,320
was the world's biggest
bookstore in Toronto.

3612
01:32:57,321 --> 01:32:58,154
It was the name of it.

3613
01:32:58,270 --> 01:33:01,390
And of course I went to the alien
section and just look all this crap up

3614
01:33:01,750 --> 01:33:02,291
immediately.

3615
01:33:02,291 --> 01:33:04,390
And there are other people with the scope.

3616
01:33:05,070 --> 01:33:09,430
Well there's a lot of other people
with stories and some of them have like

3617
01:33:09,431 --> 01:33:11,560
little pieces of something in their body.

3618
01:33:11,590 --> 01:33:13,150
I remember you talking
to me about this many,

3619
01:33:13,151 --> 01:33:13,781
many years ago.

3620
01:33:13,781 --> 01:33:14,071
I was like,

3621
01:33:14,071 --> 01:33:15,430
oh well Dave's interested.

3622
01:33:15,980 --> 01:33:17,050
It was like implants.

3623
01:33:17,060 --> 01:33:20,080
You're talking about people that
have alien implants in their body.

3624
01:33:21,070 --> 01:33:21,903
And that's the things I,

3625
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:22,833
to me it's just,

3626
01:33:23,540 --> 01:33:28,120
I guess the thing that I'm kind of
obsessed with now is just the cause we're

3627
01:33:28,121 --> 01:33:28,870
comedians.

3628
01:33:28,870 --> 01:33:29,410
Yes.

3629
01:33:29,410 --> 01:33:31,570
And the power of ridicule,

3630
01:33:32,040 --> 01:33:32,560
uh,

3631
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:33,730
to silence,

3632
01:33:33,731 --> 01:33:36,130
debate is unbelievably potent.

3633
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:36,760
Sure.

3634
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:38,020
And we're part of that.

3635
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:40,570
We're part of the machinery
that was used very,

3636
01:33:40,571 --> 01:33:45,430
very consciously by the
government to silence any inquiry.

3637
01:33:45,820 --> 01:33:46,121
You know,

3638
01:33:46,121 --> 01:33:46,570
it was like,

3639
01:33:46,570 --> 01:33:46,781
you know,

3640
01:33:46,781 --> 01:33:47,400
feeding it,

3641
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:47,680
you know,

3642
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:52,680
feeding the story the right way to late
night talk show hosts made it so that

3643
01:33:53,171 --> 01:33:54,340
nobody would talk about it.

3644
01:33:54,370 --> 01:33:58,210
So do you think that the government
consciously fed those ideas to like Johnny

3645
01:33:58,210 --> 01:33:59,043
Carson and those folks?

3646
01:33:59,830 --> 01:34:01,030
There's documentation of a,

3647
01:34:01,031 --> 01:34:01,660
of a pro,

3648
01:34:01,660 --> 01:34:02,110
you know,

3649
01:34:02,110 --> 01:34:03,160
of that they,

3650
01:34:03,161 --> 01:34:03,940
you know,

3651
01:34:03,940 --> 01:34:04,391
to,

3652
01:34:04,391 --> 01:34:05,170
uh,

3653
01:34:05,170 --> 01:34:08,740
to make the UFO phenomena ridiculous.

3654
01:34:08,741 --> 01:34:11,350
Do you think they did that
to avoid mass hysteria?

3655
01:34:11,470 --> 01:34:13,570
Like if you're the
government and you know,

3656
01:34:13,571 --> 01:34:15,870
there's nothing out there but you
see these people freaking out,

3657
01:34:15,871 --> 01:34:16,030
you go,

3658
01:34:16,030 --> 01:34:16,301
okay,

3659
01:34:16,301 --> 01:34:17,134
look,

3660
01:34:17,140 --> 01:34:17,711
we've looked,

3661
01:34:17,711 --> 01:34:19,810
we've used all of our military might,

3662
01:34:19,811 --> 01:34:22,930
all of our scientific power
and we don't see shit,

3663
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:23,771
I'm not buying this,

3664
01:34:23,771 --> 01:34:24,880
but these people are freaking out.

3665
01:34:24,910 --> 01:34:27,910
This has the real potential to get
out of hand and go sideways on us.

3666
01:34:28,060 --> 01:34:29,260
Let's just start making fun of this.

3667
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:30,130
Yeah.

3668
01:34:30,130 --> 01:34:30,701
I don't know.

3669
01:34:30,701 --> 01:34:31,534
Cause uh,

3670
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:34,930
I think it's more likely that there's
something there that they feel powerless

3671
01:34:34,931 --> 01:34:35,764
to control.

3672
01:34:35,810 --> 01:34:39,910
Do you think Kennedy was taken down into
the basement of whatever and shown the

3673
01:34:39,911 --> 01:34:44,911
alien sitting there is what I say
about aliens with in regards to Trump.

3674
01:34:45,670 --> 01:34:46,031
If this,

3675
01:34:46,031 --> 01:34:48,360
anybody that would
fucking tell us it's him,

3676
01:34:48,361 --> 01:34:48,970
I'll tweet it,

3677
01:34:48,970 --> 01:34:49,331
tweet it,

3678
01:34:49,331 --> 01:34:49,811
immediately,

3679
01:34:49,811 --> 01:34:50,644
tweet it,

3680
01:34:51,160 --> 01:34:51,993
tweet it.

3681
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:53,860
[inaudible] are real.

3682
01:34:53,861 --> 01:34:55,360
But CNN is fake.

3683
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:56,353
Yeah,

3684
01:34:56,360 --> 01:34:57,193
yeah,

3685
01:34:58,650 --> 01:34:59,483
yeah.

3686
01:34:59,810 --> 01:35:00,643
It's still,

3687
01:35:00,690 --> 01:35:04,890
he is the failing New York
Times sales defined Ufo

3688
01:35:07,190 --> 01:35:11,300
at area 51 if the government does have
the evidence they are never going to show

3689
01:35:11,301 --> 01:35:12,134
it to Trump.

3690
01:35:12,270 --> 01:35:13,130
That's the problem.

3691
01:35:13,131 --> 01:35:15,510
Like what the fuck's the point being
president if you can't find it,

3692
01:35:16,850 --> 01:35:20,770
if I knew that to become president
meant you get all the access to Ufos,

3693
01:35:20,780 --> 01:35:21,613
I might go.

3694
01:35:21,730 --> 01:35:22,300
Yeah.

3695
01:35:22,300 --> 01:35:22,790
Okay.

3696
01:35:22,790 --> 01:35:23,623
That's all very good.

3697
01:35:23,750 --> 01:35:24,590
I'm going to try for that.

3698
01:35:24,591 --> 01:35:26,270
The presidents who have
tried haven't gotten there.

3699
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:26,571
No,

3700
01:35:26,571 --> 01:35:27,320
no one gets it.

3701
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:28,100
Like Jimmy Carter.

3702
01:35:28,100 --> 01:35:29,400
Jimmy Carter said he was,

3703
01:35:29,401 --> 01:35:29,960
he he's,

3704
01:35:29,960 --> 01:35:31,190
he had a Ufo experience.

3705
01:35:31,220 --> 01:35:31,371
Yeah.

3706
01:35:31,371 --> 01:35:32,204
He saw something.

3707
01:35:33,110 --> 01:35:37,220
He said he saw something but see that
was back in the 70s where everybody was

3708
01:35:37,221 --> 01:35:38,054
seeing shit.

3709
01:35:38,210 --> 01:35:39,830
They were all talking about things.

3710
01:35:39,831 --> 01:35:43,700
It was part of the zeitgeists people
were legit like after close encounters of

3711
01:35:43,701 --> 01:35:44,370
the third kind,

3712
01:35:44,370 --> 01:35:47,990
especially people who are legitimately
thinking that aliens were going to come.

3713
01:35:48,330 --> 01:35:48,630
Yeah.

3714
01:35:48,630 --> 01:35:53,510
He proposed such a possible
scenario and that movie was so good.

3715
01:35:54,070 --> 01:35:56,570
It wasn't anything you
expected it was going to be.

3716
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:57,620
But like here I was going to say,

3717
01:35:57,720 --> 01:36:00,950
here's like another example is like the
Rendlesham like that explanation of the

3718
01:36:01,020 --> 01:36:02,480
sixteens locked,

3719
01:36:02,750 --> 01:36:03,583
you know,

3720
01:36:03,650 --> 01:36:04,483
footage,

3721
01:36:04,580 --> 01:36:05,300
uh,

3722
01:36:05,300 --> 01:36:07,560
like Rendlesham forest where the,

3723
01:36:08,420 --> 01:36:11,810
they claimed that these
American soldiers in the woods,

3724
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:12,673
out in England,

3725
01:36:13,340 --> 01:36:14,010
uh,

3726
01:36:14,010 --> 01:36:16,190
mistook the light,

3727
01:36:16,191 --> 01:36:21,191
a light house light for a spacecraft
that they were within 20 feet of a craft

3728
01:36:23,361 --> 01:36:26,210
that they saw and took notes
on different lines of yeah.

3729
01:36:26,211 --> 01:36:26,750
They walk,

3730
01:36:26,750 --> 01:36:28,250
not even like right up against it.

3731
01:36:29,180 --> 01:36:30,570
And they wrote down notes,

3732
01:36:30,571 --> 01:36:34,020
saw like different sort of hieroglyphs
on the ship itself described it's

3733
01:36:34,300 --> 01:36:34,930
described the,

3734
01:36:34,930 --> 01:36:35,810
the feel of it,

3735
01:36:35,811 --> 01:36:37,820
this electrostatic feel
of being around it.

3736
01:36:38,180 --> 01:36:41,490
And the official
explanation was they missed,

3737
01:36:41,491 --> 01:36:46,220
took a lighthouse several
miles away for this spacecraft.

3738
01:36:46,730 --> 01:36:48,530
So outcomes razor against us.

3739
01:36:50,330 --> 01:36:53,450
That's hard to believe that these trained
observers and that's the other thing.

3740
01:36:53,451 --> 01:36:56,060
They always tried to dismiss the idea
that trained observers are better

3741
01:36:56,061 --> 01:36:56,894
observers.

3742
01:36:57,330 --> 01:36:58,100
Um,

3743
01:36:58,100 --> 01:36:59,720
but they are better observers.

3744
01:36:59,810 --> 01:37:00,470
Sure.

3745
01:37:00,470 --> 01:37:01,730
In the age of,

3746
01:37:01,730 --> 01:37:02,150
yeah.

3747
01:37:02,150 --> 01:37:06,740
Today where everyone has a high
definition camera in their pocket.

3748
01:37:06,741 --> 01:37:07,370
Have you taken,

3749
01:37:07,370 --> 01:37:10,010
have you taken a photograph
of the moon on your,

3750
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:10,873
on your phones?

3751
01:37:11,140 --> 01:37:12,320
It doesn't look like the moon.

3752
01:37:12,350 --> 01:37:12,880
What's true,

3753
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:13,310
right.

3754
01:37:13,310 --> 01:37:14,300
There's no details.

3755
01:37:14,410 --> 01:37:15,740
It comes out of the lung.

3756
01:37:15,820 --> 01:37:17,090
The lenses are too wide,

3757
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:18,260
but,

3758
01:37:18,260 --> 01:37:19,430
but I'll comes.

3759
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:20,211
Razors has all right,

3760
01:37:20,211 --> 01:37:22,610
they saw something but they,

3761
01:37:22,710 --> 01:37:23,090
you know,

3762
01:37:23,090 --> 01:37:26,690
cause what is the likelihood that trained
observers who have been on this base

3763
01:37:26,691 --> 01:37:31,310
for years on this night would mistake a
lighthouse that they've seen every night

3764
01:37:31,340 --> 01:37:34,100
for the entire time they've
been on this base for a Ufo?

3765
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:36,351
I mean,

3766
01:37:36,351 --> 01:37:39,320
what is the likelihood that
that explanation is correct?

3767
01:37:39,350 --> 01:37:40,400
I'm not aware of that store.

3768
01:37:40,730 --> 01:37:40,911
Oh,

3769
01:37:40,911 --> 01:37:41,744
Rendlesham forest.

3770
01:37:41,750 --> 01:37:42,020
Yeah.

3771
01:37:42,020 --> 01:37:42,560
How'd he say it?

3772
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:46,460
Bent Woods or incurring
some Rendlesham and r.

3773
01:37:46,461 --> 01:37:50,450
E.

3774
01:37:50,450 --> 01:37:50,450
N.

3775
01:37:50,450 --> 01:37:50,450
D.

3776
01:37:50,450 --> 01:37:50,450
L.

3777
01:37:50,450 --> 01:37:50,450
E.

3778
01:37:50,450 --> 01:37:50,450
S.

3779
01:37:50,450 --> 01:37:50,450
H.

3780
01:37:50,450 --> 01:37:50,450
A.

3781
01:37:50,450 --> 01:37:50,450
M.

3782
01:37:50,450 --> 01:37:51,500
Rendlesham forest was bandwidths.

3783
01:37:51,501 --> 01:37:53,720
It was two nights to get
character actor on Colombo.

3784
01:37:53,780 --> 01:37:54,460
Where are you up?

3785
01:37:54,460 --> 01:37:56,010
Where and

3786
01:37:56,060 --> 01:37:56,370
it was a,

3787
01:37:56,370 --> 01:37:57,990
and it's a nuclear installations.

3788
01:37:58,230 --> 01:38:02,550
Rendlesham forest and nuclear
installations are always
ripe with Ufo stories.

3789
01:38:02,980 --> 01:38:03,813
Yeah.

3790
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:05,033
What year was this?

3791
01:38:05,160 --> 01:38:05,611
Uh,

3792
01:38:05,611 --> 01:38:06,460
this was in the 80s.

3793
01:38:06,830 --> 01:38:07,260
80?

3794
01:38:07,260 --> 01:38:07,710
Yeah.

3795
01:38:07,710 --> 01:38:08,520
Mm.

3796
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:09,353
Interesting.

3797
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:10,000
And it's,

3798
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:10,310
you know,

3799
01:38:10,310 --> 01:38:10,920
and it said,

3800
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:13,540
obviously the obvious explanation
is not the explanation.

3801
01:38:13,590 --> 01:38:16,260
The only thing you can accept is
that these observers saw something.

3802
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:17,820
You described it accurately.

3803
01:38:17,880 --> 01:38:19,410
Is it something that had crashed,

3804
01:38:19,411 --> 01:38:20,280
if you want to say that?

3805
01:38:20,281 --> 01:38:20,490
No,

3806
01:38:20,490 --> 01:38:21,510
it came down was,

3807
01:38:21,780 --> 01:38:22,613
was,

3808
01:38:22,740 --> 01:38:23,071
uh,

3809
01:38:23,071 --> 01:38:24,790
landed in the forest and,

3810
01:38:25,090 --> 01:38:25,923
and took off.

3811
01:38:26,340 --> 01:38:28,290
What do you think of the rotten
king case the night before that?

3812
01:38:28,291 --> 01:38:28,651
Roswell.

3813
01:38:28,651 --> 01:38:29,450
I,

3814
01:38:29,450 --> 01:38:30,840
I think it's probably true.

3815
01:38:31,170 --> 01:38:31,580
Real.

3816
01:38:31,580 --> 01:38:32,610
You're all in?

3817
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:33,000
Yeah.

3818
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:33,210
Well,

3819
01:38:33,210 --> 01:38:34,043
David,

3820
01:38:34,130 --> 01:38:34,660
I mean,

3821
01:38:34,660 --> 01:38:35,640
because the interesting,

3822
01:38:35,650 --> 01:38:36,091
but again,

3823
01:38:36,091 --> 01:38:36,660
because the,

3824
01:38:36,660 --> 01:38:38,250
because the cover stories for our,

3825
01:38:38,251 --> 01:38:41,070
so much less believable then an alien.

3826
01:38:41,100 --> 01:38:41,401
Yeah.

3827
01:38:41,401 --> 01:38:42,420
I used to have a joke about it.

3828
01:38:42,470 --> 01:38:43,100
Yeah.

3829
01:38:43,100 --> 01:38:47,610
They put it on the paper that they have
recovered a crashed Ufo and alien bodies

3830
01:38:47,820 --> 01:38:48,780
and the next day set up,

3831
01:38:48,781 --> 01:38:49,381
we made a mistake.

3832
01:38:49,381 --> 01:38:50,214
It was just a balloon.

3833
01:38:51,070 --> 01:38:51,903
What about,

3834
01:38:52,830 --> 01:38:53,760
what about the aliens?

3835
01:38:56,010 --> 01:38:56,880
They're Mexicans.

3836
01:38:56,881 --> 01:38:57,714
They were drinking,

3837
01:38:57,780 --> 01:38:59,030
apparently they thought the balloons up,

3838
01:38:59,120 --> 01:38:59,953
Yada.

3839
01:39:00,570 --> 01:39:01,590
He got a little crazy.

3840
01:39:02,970 --> 01:39:04,320
We just invented some new stuff.

3841
01:39:04,350 --> 01:39:04,590
Yeah.

3842
01:39:04,590 --> 01:39:05,220
Out of nowhere.

3843
01:39:05,220 --> 01:39:06,390
And then 30 years later they go,

3844
01:39:06,420 --> 01:39:06,780
oh,

3845
01:39:06,780 --> 01:39:07,260
we were,

3846
01:39:07,260 --> 01:39:10,830
they were high altitude a
dummies that we were dropping.

3847
01:39:10,890 --> 01:39:11,341
That's right.

3848
01:39:11,341 --> 01:39:13,320
To test how they would fall.

3849
01:39:13,370 --> 01:39:13,720
And that was,

3850
01:39:13,720 --> 01:39:15,900
we have lasers and visibility cloaks.

3851
01:39:16,020 --> 01:39:16,451
Well the,

3852
01:39:16,451 --> 01:39:20,700
they showed up again the next day
with a bunch of weather balloons.

3853
01:39:20,701 --> 01:39:21,410
Scraps.

3854
01:39:21,410 --> 01:39:21,610
Yeah.

3855
01:39:21,610 --> 01:39:22,171
Like look,

3856
01:39:22,171 --> 01:39:22,670
this is,

3857
01:39:22,670 --> 01:39:22,890
yeah.

3858
01:39:22,890 --> 01:39:23,760
What the guy holding it up.

3859
01:39:23,860 --> 01:39:27,570
Like what they don't tell you is that
they flew the wreckage out to Wright

3860
01:39:27,570 --> 01:39:30,510
Patterson air force in two separate
planes and the Truman met them there.

3861
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:31,433
Yeah,

3862
01:39:31,490 --> 01:39:32,060
yeah,

3863
01:39:32,060 --> 01:39:32,340
yeah.

3864
01:39:32,340 --> 01:39:33,173
So I mean,

3865
01:39:33,480 --> 01:39:34,020
yeah,

3866
01:39:34,020 --> 01:39:37,140
the more rational separate planes the
morning because they were worried that one

3867
01:39:37,141 --> 01:39:39,150
would crash the weather,

3868
01:39:39,240 --> 01:39:43,140
the weather balloon thing is not as
rational as something weird happened.

3869
01:39:43,230 --> 01:39:43,711
I listened to,

3870
01:39:43,711 --> 01:39:48,060
I want it to be alien so
bad I questioned myself.

3871
01:39:48,180 --> 01:39:49,230
So that's my problem.

3872
01:39:49,380 --> 01:39:50,520
I want to do that stuff.

3873
01:39:50,550 --> 01:39:51,181
But again,

3874
01:39:51,181 --> 01:39:51,570
I,

3875
01:39:51,570 --> 01:39:52,980
I won't like,

3876
01:39:53,160 --> 01:39:56,130
I'll be skeptical about stuff that just
seems crazy or people that you know,

3877
01:39:56,420 --> 01:39:57,120
you know,

3878
01:39:57,120 --> 01:40:00,000
sort of ascribe some sort of
metaphysical explanation for all this.

3879
01:40:00,270 --> 01:40:00,780
Uh,

3880
01:40:00,780 --> 01:40:01,230
my,

3881
01:40:01,230 --> 01:40:02,700
my thing is just,

3882
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:06,360
well if the preponderance of the evidence
says something happened but doesn't

3883
01:40:06,361 --> 01:40:07,380
tell you what happened,

3884
01:40:08,100 --> 01:40:09,690
then you still have to
believe something happened.

3885
01:40:09,750 --> 01:40:13,590
Not knowing what happened isn't evidence
that it didn't happen and yet you're

3886
01:40:13,591 --> 01:40:15,510
still a flat earthers yeah.

3887
01:40:16,740 --> 01:40:17,730
Have you looked outside?

3888
01:40:18,810 --> 01:40:20,010
It's seems flat.

3889
01:40:20,020 --> 01:40:20,853
Yeah.

3890
01:40:21,330 --> 01:40:23,820
Have you studied Hashtag
faith spaces fake?

3891
01:40:24,360 --> 01:40:24,601
Uh,

3892
01:40:24,601 --> 01:40:25,070
no.

3893
01:40:25,070 --> 01:40:27,730
Just lived into people dumber.

3894
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:30,450
There's people that are so dumb.

3895
01:40:30,780 --> 01:40:32,850
You think the earth is
flat and this people that,

3896
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:34,020
that are so dumb,

3897
01:40:34,021 --> 01:40:37,440
they make fun of the people
that are dumber than them.

3898
01:40:37,740 --> 01:40:38,520
Yeah.

3899
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:38,850
Yeah.

3900
01:40:38,850 --> 01:40:41,730
They think that that
space is fake spaces fake.

3901
01:40:41,790 --> 01:40:42,623
There's no space,

3902
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:44,033
no space.

3903
01:40:44,130 --> 01:40:44,963
And it's basically,

3904
01:40:45,580 --> 01:40:47,040
well that's the holographic theory.

3905
01:40:47,160 --> 01:40:47,640
Yeah.

3906
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:48,421
When you Google it,

3907
01:40:48,421 --> 01:40:49,770
it's really religious.

3908
01:40:50,280 --> 01:40:50,941
It's a,

3909
01:40:50,941 --> 01:40:53,860
it's all about the
firmament and the Bible.

3910
01:40:54,230 --> 01:40:55,020
That makes sense.

3911
01:40:55,020 --> 01:40:55,570
They're really,

3912
01:40:55,570 --> 01:40:58,920
it's very strange because the stars
are hung in the sky over earth.

3913
01:40:58,930 --> 01:40:59,770
What you would call like,

3914
01:40:59,771 --> 01:41:00,041
yeah.

3915
01:41:00,041 --> 01:41:00,874
Sand,

3916
01:41:00,910 --> 01:41:02,050
youtube people.

3917
01:41:02,590 --> 01:41:03,423
Here it is.

3918
01:41:04,030 --> 01:41:04,481
And you know what?

3919
01:41:04,481 --> 01:41:06,400
Fuck don't have full again cause I'm 56.

3920
01:41:06,430 --> 01:41:06,761
Wow.

3921
01:41:06,761 --> 01:41:07,450
That's incredible.

3922
01:41:07,450 --> 01:41:08,290
Human explore.

3923
01:41:08,291 --> 01:41:10,360
Ocean Ocean title.

3924
01:41:10,900 --> 01:41:11,650
I understand.

3925
01:41:11,650 --> 01:41:12,510
I have to be some times.

3926
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:13,480
Um,

3927
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:13,730
yeah.

3928
01:41:13,730 --> 01:41:15,030
Hashtag spaces faith,

3929
01:41:15,640 --> 01:41:16,870
human dug earth.

3930
01:41:17,390 --> 01:41:18,190
Mm.

3931
01:41:18,190 --> 01:41:19,023
Yeah.

3932
01:41:19,750 --> 01:41:23,560
Human explore ocean suddenly beginning
to discover a thousand miles really well

3933
01:41:23,561 --> 01:41:24,340
written,

3934
01:41:24,340 --> 01:41:25,001
super,

3935
01:41:25,001 --> 01:41:25,834
super compelling.

3936
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:27,610
They can discover a thousand miles.

3937
01:41:28,050 --> 01:41:30,940
I wonder how many of those I was
talking to you about Rene de Resta,

3938
01:41:30,941 --> 01:41:33,860
who's the woman who studies
all these Russian troll farms.

3939
01:41:33,861 --> 01:41:34,694
So then they're mocked.

3940
01:41:34,780 --> 01:41:38,280
I wonder how much of that is
them that the Russians side,

3941
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:39,390
flat earth,

3942
01:41:39,580 --> 01:41:40,240
uh,

3943
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:44,380
spaces fake department where they just
mock it cause it's always in English.

3944
01:41:44,410 --> 01:41:46,210
I don't think there's a lot of flat earth,

3945
01:41:46,211 --> 01:41:47,290
Russian proponents.

3946
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:47,711
God,

3947
01:41:47,711 --> 01:41:51,250
if I was one of those Russian guys that
I would want that to be my department.

3948
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:52,050
Yeah.

3949
01:41:52,050 --> 01:41:54,310
Just cold call people.

3950
01:41:54,311 --> 01:41:57,820
Globe tards or globe heads.

3951
01:41:57,850 --> 01:41:58,091
Yeah.

3952
01:41:58,091 --> 01:41:58,721
If you believe in,

3953
01:41:58,721 --> 01:41:59,830
if you're around.

3954
01:42:00,300 --> 01:42:01,133
Yeah.

3955
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:04,270
I've saved some of these memes
because they're so wonderful.

3956
01:42:04,271 --> 01:42:04,751
They're just like,

3957
01:42:04,751 --> 01:42:06,070
this is just rich.

3958
01:42:06,100 --> 01:42:09,190
I had the worst duper
ride with a guy who was,

3959
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:09,710
uh,

3960
01:42:09,710 --> 01:42:10,543
a flat earth there.

3961
01:42:11,350 --> 01:42:11,831
Yeah,

3962
01:42:11,831 --> 01:42:12,640
he was.

3963
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:15,130
And he was a computer programmer.

3964
01:42:15,550 --> 01:42:16,180
What?

3965
01:42:16,180 --> 01:42:16,930
Yeah,

3966
01:42:16,930 --> 01:42:20,880
a computer programmer slash
flat Arthur and driving an Uber.

3967
01:42:20,910 --> 01:42:23,920
Not Working at NASA the
whole time while he,

3968
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:25,840
while he drove me crazy,

3969
01:42:26,380 --> 01:42:27,213
he drove me.

3970
01:42:27,310 --> 01:42:28,270
He knew what he was doing it.

3971
01:42:28,271 --> 01:42:29,560
I think it's doing it on purpose.

3972
01:42:29,561 --> 01:42:29,630
Yeah,

3973
01:42:29,630 --> 01:42:30,460
I think so.

3974
01:42:30,460 --> 01:42:31,271
How did he start it off?

3975
01:42:31,271 --> 01:42:33,670
So I bet you're one of those guys
that believes the Earth's round,

3976
01:42:33,671 --> 01:42:34,360
Huh?

3977
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:34,781
Well,

3978
01:42:34,781 --> 01:42:37,570
I talked about the beautiful
view from the plane.

3979
01:42:37,571 --> 01:42:38,650
They picked me up at the airport.

3980
01:42:38,850 --> 01:42:39,370
Yeah.

3981
01:42:39,370 --> 01:42:39,740
And,

3982
01:42:39,740 --> 01:42:40,481
and you know,

3983
01:42:40,481 --> 01:42:41,440
it's so beautiful.

3984
01:42:41,441 --> 01:42:43,270
The sunset over the
curvature of the earth.

3985
01:42:43,480 --> 01:42:44,313
That's how it started.

3986
01:42:45,120 --> 01:42:45,953
I think of us went up.

3987
01:42:46,810 --> 01:42:48,370
Not really the curvature of the earth.

3988
01:42:49,510 --> 01:42:50,530
That's how it started.

3989
01:42:51,120 --> 01:42:52,450
And he will not stop.

3990
01:42:52,510 --> 01:42:52,711
Oh,

3991
01:42:52,711 --> 01:42:54,790
my point where I was,

3992
01:42:54,910 --> 01:42:55,743
I think,

3993
01:42:56,140 --> 01:42:57,730
I think I tore my clothes off.

3994
01:43:00,850 --> 01:43:02,140
He made me sell insane.

3995
01:43:02,141 --> 01:43:03,580
There's so many of them now and you know,

3996
01:43:03,581 --> 01:43:03,991
we,

3997
01:43:03,991 --> 01:43:07,090
we've uncovered the origins of it
are what we think the origins of it.

3998
01:43:07,091 --> 01:43:09,070
It was a troll from four Chan,

3999
01:43:09,610 --> 01:43:12,880
four Chan was fucking around and they
started promoting this idea that the earth

4000
01:43:12,881 --> 01:43:13,661
is actually the flower.

4001
01:43:13,661 --> 01:43:16,390
It started that a lot of
things start from that sense.

4002
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:19,000
That's where the free bleeding
movement started from.

4003
01:43:19,150 --> 01:43:19,931
I don't know what that is.

4004
01:43:19,931 --> 01:43:24,370
Women are expressing their power by not
controlling their menstrual cycle with

4005
01:43:24,371 --> 01:43:25,630
pads or tampons.

4006
01:43:25,631 --> 01:43:28,240
Just bleeding into their
pants to show their power.

4007
01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:29,021
Yeah.

4008
01:43:29,021 --> 01:43:30,700
They did it on four Chan as a joke,

4009
01:43:30,701 --> 01:43:32,080
and the women started
doing it in real life.

4010
01:43:32,081 --> 01:43:32,590
For Real.

4011
01:43:32,590 --> 01:43:32,831
Yeah.

4012
01:43:32,831 --> 01:43:34,120
They thought that thought it was like,

4013
01:43:34,150 --> 01:43:35,410
this is a way to like,

4014
01:43:35,650 --> 01:43:37,450
these people were disgusted
by menstrual blood.

4015
01:43:38,210 --> 01:43:39,043
Yeah.

4016
01:43:39,200 --> 01:43:41,410
Shit on the Patriarchy by
showing your pussy blood.

4017
01:43:42,300 --> 01:43:43,560
God.

4018
01:43:46,180 --> 01:43:47,013
Crazy.

4019
01:43:47,950 --> 01:43:48,311
Crazy.

4020
01:43:48,311 --> 01:43:49,670
It makes me want to start one four.

4021
01:43:49,750 --> 01:43:50,650
Chan is the best.

4022
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:51,111
They just,

4023
01:43:51,111 --> 01:43:52,070
they're so good at that.

4024
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:55,760
They're so good at starting these goofy
ass fucking little movements and then

4025
01:43:55,790 --> 01:43:57,200
getting people behind it.

4026
01:43:57,580 --> 01:43:58,310
It's like a,

4027
01:43:58,310 --> 01:43:59,270
it's like a game.

4028
01:43:59,360 --> 01:43:59,640
Yeah.

4029
01:43:59,640 --> 01:43:59,980
Yeah.

4030
01:43:59,980 --> 01:44:00,560
A game.

4031
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:00,771
Well,

4032
01:44:00,771 --> 01:44:00,951
it's,

4033
01:44:00,951 --> 01:44:01,521
you know what it is?

4034
01:44:01,521 --> 01:44:03,080
It's probably a bunch
of really smart people.

4035
01:44:03,230 --> 01:44:03,650
Um,

4036
01:44:03,650 --> 01:44:04,760
some of them not so smart,

4037
01:44:04,761 --> 01:44:07,430
but some of them really smart that are
stuck at their desks and they're bored as

4038
01:44:07,431 --> 01:44:10,290
shit with some computer job
somewhere and they think of,

4039
01:44:10,640 --> 01:44:11,331
in the meantime,

4040
01:44:11,331 --> 01:44:12,950
they just decided to fuck with people.

4041
01:44:13,070 --> 01:44:13,903
Right.

4042
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:17,420
We're talking about a flat
earthers free bleeding,

4043
01:44:17,870 --> 01:44:19,310
the free bleeding movement,

4044
01:44:19,340 --> 01:44:24,020
which was also started by four Chan Four
Chan started this movement where women

4045
01:44:24,021 --> 01:44:27,200
would express their power by not
controlling their menstrual cycle by just

4046
01:44:27,201 --> 01:44:29,270
letting the blood leak
out into their pants.

4047
01:44:29,870 --> 01:44:34,100
And they did it as a joke that four Chan
did and women started actually doing

4048
01:44:34,101 --> 01:44:34,250
it.

4049
01:44:34,250 --> 01:44:34,850
Caught on.

4050
01:44:34,850 --> 01:44:35,640
Yeah.

4051
01:44:35,640 --> 01:44:37,010
That's a lot of these things.

4052
01:44:37,250 --> 01:44:38,930
It's so hard to mock,

4053
01:44:39,010 --> 01:44:39,581
but it's so,

4054
01:44:39,581 --> 01:44:43,220
so hard to figure out like what
is mockery and what's real.

4055
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:43,761
Exactly.

4056
01:44:43,761 --> 01:44:45,260
What is parody and what's,

4057
01:44:45,330 --> 01:44:46,163
what's,

4058
01:44:46,430 --> 01:44:47,263
what's the onion?

4059
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:48,440
The onion is,

4060
01:44:48,650 --> 01:44:49,483
you know,

4061
01:44:49,940 --> 01:44:50,680
have you,

4062
01:44:50,680 --> 01:44:52,940
do you know that James Lindsey,

4063
01:44:53,150 --> 01:44:55,130
Peter Boghossian was how the woman's name,

4064
01:44:55,131 --> 01:44:58,280
the one one that we didn't meet
the grievance studies hoaxes.

4065
01:44:58,550 --> 01:44:59,383
Do you know

4066
01:45:01,670 --> 01:45:05,810
Peter but goes in as a professor
at University of Portland and um,

4067
01:45:05,870 --> 01:45:07,940
I think that's the
school he's in Portland.

4068
01:45:08,230 --> 01:45:08,960
Um,

4069
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:10,580
and he decided to,

4070
01:45:10,581 --> 01:45:11,930
with these other academics,

4071
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:15,110
publish these fake papers on like,

4072
01:45:15,111 --> 01:45:15,910
um,

4073
01:45:15,910 --> 01:45:16,743
uh,

4074
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:18,890
rape and dog parks and like,

4075
01:45:18,891 --> 01:45:19,340
uh,

4076
01:45:19,340 --> 01:45:20,060
like,

4077
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:20,420
like,

4078
01:45:20,420 --> 01:45:21,253
uh,

4079
01:45:21,410 --> 01:45:22,940
cis normative,

4080
01:45:23,030 --> 01:45:24,800
like different,

4081
01:45:24,801 --> 01:45:26,030
like [inaudible] what happened?

4082
01:45:26,090 --> 01:45:27,440
No people loved them.

4083
01:45:28,130 --> 01:45:30,720
Ridiculous things like fat bodybuilding,

4084
01:45:30,740 --> 01:45:31,880
like bodybuilding contest,

4085
01:45:31,881 --> 01:45:32,870
a contest for fat.

4086
01:45:32,870 --> 01:45:36,770
People like to talk about the impairment
with the importance of these things,

4087
01:45:36,771 --> 01:45:40,850
like things that you would read and you
would think would be obviously a parody.

4088
01:45:40,851 --> 01:45:41,684
Someone's fucking around.

4089
01:45:41,990 --> 01:45:42,801
They submit these,

4090
01:45:42,801 --> 01:45:44,930
these academic journals
not only get published,

4091
01:45:44,931 --> 01:45:46,580
but they get praised for,

4092
01:45:46,610 --> 01:45:47,960
for their scholarship,

4093
01:45:48,740 --> 01:45:49,970
and then they came out and said,

4094
01:45:49,971 --> 01:45:50,091
hey,

4095
01:45:50,091 --> 01:45:51,110
we were fucking with you guys.

4096
01:45:51,111 --> 01:45:51,944
This is all Joe.

4097
01:45:52,170 --> 01:45:52,430
Yeah.

4098
01:45:52,430 --> 01:45:53,780
It's out there and you know,

4099
01:45:53,990 --> 01:45:55,310
you guys love these papers,

4100
01:45:55,311 --> 01:45:56,144
you morons,

4101
01:45:56,150 --> 01:45:57,700
and that this is problem.

4102
01:45:57,740 --> 01:46:02,740
Part of the problem with the humanities
today is that things are so sideways in

4103
01:46:02,871 --> 01:46:03,531
terms of like,

4104
01:46:03,531 --> 01:46:04,850
it's so difficult to find out what's,

4105
01:46:05,210 --> 01:46:07,010
what's parody and what's reality.

4106
01:46:07,130 --> 01:46:07,963
Yeah.

4107
01:46:09,350 --> 01:46:10,183
It's insane.

4108
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,580
It's an insane time is insane as it gets.

4109
01:46:13,640 --> 01:46:14,210
Yeah,

4110
01:46:14,210 --> 01:46:15,043
yeah,

4111
01:46:15,140 --> 01:46:15,381
yeah.

4112
01:46:15,381 --> 01:46:15,831
Then it gets,

4113
01:46:15,831 --> 01:46:17,000
it says very unsettling.

4114
01:46:17,240 --> 01:46:20,930
It's fine to not know if
someone's having me on or not.

4115
01:46:21,020 --> 01:46:21,810
Exactly.

4116
01:46:21,810 --> 01:46:22,340
Yeah.

4117
01:46:22,340 --> 01:46:22,560
Well,

4118
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:23,420
it's very,

4119
01:46:23,540 --> 01:46:28,540
all the structures that used that for
good or for bad would filter things down

4120
01:46:29,450 --> 01:46:30,283
are gone.

4121
01:46:30,440 --> 01:46:31,130
Yeah.

4122
01:46:31,130 --> 01:46:31,461
You know,

4123
01:46:31,461 --> 01:46:31,881
like we,

4124
01:46:31,881 --> 01:46:32,151
you know,

4125
01:46:32,151 --> 01:46:35,930
everything was handed over to powerful
people who filtered what we were given to

4126
01:46:35,931 --> 01:46:36,764
know.

4127
01:46:36,860 --> 01:46:37,581
There used to be,

4128
01:46:37,581 --> 01:46:37,970
uh,

4129
01:46:37,970 --> 01:46:41,570
an agreement of common sense
that used to hang around.

4130
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:45,950
I think the cure is fine reading and I
think we're going to accept that cure

4131
01:46:46,130 --> 01:46:46,460
because I,

4132
01:46:46,460 --> 01:46:46,910
you know,

4133
01:46:46,910 --> 01:46:50,130
Ilan is working on some
sort of neural link things.

4134
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:51,870
The only way we'll know if
someone's telling them the truth.

4135
01:46:52,710 --> 01:46:53,400
I think it's good.

4136
01:46:53,400 --> 01:46:56,280
We're going to accept it and we're
going to give in and we're gonna we're,

4137
01:46:56,281 --> 01:46:57,540
we're going to be able to,

4138
01:46:57,740 --> 01:46:59,340
I'll take it another step further.

4139
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:01,320
I think they're going to
create a universal language.

4140
01:47:01,321 --> 01:47:02,430
I've been thinking about this a lot.

4141
01:47:02,670 --> 01:47:06,600
I think there's going to be a universal
language that probably is a augmented

4142
01:47:06,601 --> 01:47:07,081
reality,

4143
01:47:07,081 --> 01:47:12,081
some augmented reality language shapes
or some kind of symbolism that is

4144
01:47:13,350 --> 01:47:16,650
something that we agreed to and we're
probably not going to accept it because

4145
01:47:16,651 --> 01:47:17,131
we're old.

4146
01:47:17,131 --> 01:47:17,401
We're like,

4147
01:47:17,401 --> 01:47:18,570
fuck this next generation.

4148
01:47:18,571 --> 01:47:19,320
Our kids,

4149
01:47:19,320 --> 01:47:20,280
maybe even our kids,

4150
01:47:20,281 --> 01:47:20,971
kids are kids.

4151
01:47:20,971 --> 01:47:23,310
Kids are going to be the first people
to adopt it and then it's going to be

4152
01:47:23,311 --> 01:47:28,311
universal worldwide and with augmented
reality and some sort of ability to

4153
01:47:29,911 --> 01:47:33,240
interact with each other
through kind of bandwidth.

4154
01:47:33,330 --> 01:47:36,900
I remember the first time I heard about
cochlear implants as the first thing

4155
01:47:36,901 --> 01:47:37,621
that popped in my head is,

4156
01:47:37,621 --> 01:47:38,520
this is the start.

4157
01:47:38,660 --> 01:47:38,910
Yeah.

4158
01:47:38,910 --> 01:47:42,240
This is the interface now officially a,

4159
01:47:42,290 --> 01:47:43,123
you're a sidebar.

4160
01:47:43,560 --> 01:47:44,311
Cochlear implant.

4161
01:47:44,311 --> 01:47:45,140
You are a Cyborg.

4162
01:47:45,140 --> 01:47:45,370
Oh,

4163
01:47:45,370 --> 01:47:46,290
he's a $600 one.

4164
01:47:46,291 --> 01:47:47,700
People with apple watches on,

4165
01:47:47,820 --> 01:47:48,400
yeah.

4166
01:47:48,400 --> 01:47:49,530
You're wearing an apple watch.

4167
01:47:49,531 --> 01:47:50,011
Like what do you,

4168
01:47:50,011 --> 01:47:50,341
what do you,

4169
01:47:50,341 --> 01:47:50,761
what is that?

4170
01:47:50,761 --> 01:47:53,610
You have a computer that's constantly
strapped to you all the time,

4171
01:47:53,630 --> 01:47:55,470
is you monitoring your heart rate,

4172
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:56,041
you know,

4173
01:47:56,041 --> 01:47:58,110
and then we've been sitting here and,

4174
01:47:58,140 --> 01:47:58,973
uh,

4175
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:00,000
when we don't know something,

4176
01:48:00,001 --> 01:48:03,030
accessing the entire
store of human knowledge,

4177
01:48:03,060 --> 01:48:04,150
Jamie's our sidebar,

4178
01:48:05,070 --> 01:48:07,530
we're accessing all of human
knowledge in an instant.

4179
01:48:07,531 --> 01:48:07,980
True.

4180
01:48:07,980 --> 01:48:08,813
Anytime we will not.

4181
01:48:08,820 --> 01:48:11,400
That was Elan's other thing
that he said on the podcast.

4182
01:48:11,401 --> 01:48:12,360
You're already a Cyborg.

4183
01:48:12,361 --> 01:48:13,050
You have a phone.

4184
01:48:13,050 --> 01:48:13,381
It just,

4185
01:48:13,381 --> 01:48:14,520
it's not in your body,

4186
01:48:14,521 --> 01:48:15,870
but it's something you're holding onto.

4187
01:48:16,380 --> 01:48:16,920
Yeah.

4188
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:17,520
It's calming.

4189
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:18,690
It's voluntary cyborg.

4190
01:48:18,691 --> 01:48:20,310
Did you guys read the
third wave years ago?

4191
01:48:20,370 --> 01:48:21,170
Was that a book here?

4192
01:48:21,170 --> 01:48:24,060
I forgot it now know that was
the protection of all this.

4193
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:24,721
Yeah,

4194
01:48:24,721 --> 01:48:29,721
and the early eighties and it was a
prediction and the one thing a third way

4195
01:48:31,321 --> 01:48:33,480
predicted was that the next generation,

4196
01:48:34,110 --> 01:48:35,190
the first line in it,

4197
01:48:35,191 --> 01:48:35,901
I remember it was at,

4198
01:48:35,901 --> 01:48:36,960
it's all about information.

4199
01:48:37,020 --> 01:48:37,350
Yeah.

4200
01:48:37,350 --> 01:48:39,540
It's all going to be
about sharing information.

4201
01:48:39,560 --> 01:48:42,090
You know that someone's going to
figure out a way to share information.

4202
01:48:42,120 --> 01:48:42,241
Well,

4203
01:48:42,241 --> 01:48:44,040
that's when I saw the cochlear implant.

4204
01:48:44,220 --> 01:48:44,641
I thought,

4205
01:48:44,641 --> 01:48:44,821
well,

4206
01:48:44,821 --> 01:48:45,960
if you're all right,

4207
01:48:45,961 --> 01:48:46,794
so your,

4208
01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:51,510
your brain is interpreting an electronic
signal as information directly.

4209
01:48:51,540 --> 01:48:53,460
It's bypassing the ear entirely.

4210
01:48:53,620 --> 01:48:54,150
Right,

4211
01:48:54,150 --> 01:48:57,180
and it's just a neuronal
connection and does that will,

4212
01:48:57,270 --> 01:49:00,660
that eventually is how we
will access the Internet,

4213
01:49:00,661 --> 01:49:03,090
will access the Internet as
though it is our own thoughts.

4214
01:49:03,560 --> 01:49:06,120
It will be as easily as
I remember your name.

4215
01:49:06,210 --> 01:49:09,930
I don't remember any other fact that is
on record the matrix and we'll all be

4216
01:49:09,931 --> 01:49:11,130
part of the same.

4217
01:49:11,250 --> 01:49:11,431
Yeah,

4218
01:49:11,431 --> 01:49:11,731
exactly.

4219
01:49:11,731 --> 01:49:13,080
We won't be sitting in pods somewhere.

4220
01:49:13,320 --> 01:49:14,020
Well,

4221
01:49:14,020 --> 01:49:17,040
I think it speak for yourself and
initially will be like a peripheral thing.

4222
01:49:17,041 --> 01:49:19,860
You'd be able to tap into it
or not as you as you wish,

4223
01:49:20,100 --> 01:49:21,930
but I think as time goes on,

4224
01:49:21,931 --> 01:49:23,490
it's going to be more and more integrated.

4225
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:25,380
Just like distinguished
it from your own mind.

4226
01:49:25,381 --> 01:49:29,250
Like you used to have to go to a computer
that was hardwired into the wall and

4227
01:49:29,251 --> 01:49:31,380
you'd have to dial up to get online.

4228
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:31,740
Yeah.

4229
01:49:31,740 --> 01:49:33,420
Now everything's instantaneous.

4230
01:49:33,421 --> 01:49:34,141
This in your phone,

4231
01:49:34,141 --> 01:49:35,060
and this isn't me.

4232
01:49:35,130 --> 01:49:36,990
I remember when we were on news radio,

4233
01:49:37,020 --> 01:49:41,370
I first got an apple computer and got
online and I was fucking fascinated.

4234
01:49:41,640 --> 01:49:42,600
I couldn't believe,

4235
01:49:42,660 --> 01:49:43,660
and the two comp you serve,

4236
01:49:43,670 --> 01:49:45,330
this is how we got to bring it all around.

4237
01:49:45,510 --> 01:49:48,040
The first thing I did
was download reports,

4238
01:49:48,940 --> 01:49:49,840
downloading Ufo,

4239
01:49:49,900 --> 01:49:50,770
like a Dork,

4240
01:49:50,771 --> 01:49:52,000
like learning all these things.

4241
01:49:52,001 --> 01:49:52,270
Yeah.

4242
01:49:52,270 --> 01:49:57,270
Well I remember the first chat with
somebody I remember in 1993 and it was 95

4243
01:49:58,370 --> 01:49:59,111
office computer.

4244
01:49:59,111 --> 01:50:02,260
First Time I had an Newsradio was the
first time I had an email account.

4245
01:50:02,930 --> 01:50:03,401
I remember that.

4246
01:50:03,401 --> 01:50:04,480
And getting on online.

4247
01:50:04,570 --> 01:50:05,880
I know and I mean,

4248
01:50:05,890 --> 01:50:06,041
yeah,

4249
01:50:06,041 --> 01:50:08,590
at first I think I went
to the Lubes site sure.

4250
01:50:08,591 --> 01:50:10,480
To see what was on there and you know,

4251
01:50:10,540 --> 01:50:15,100
watch Hieronymus Bosch painting
download in about 30 minutes

4252
01:50:16,690 --> 01:50:17,290
and then that was,

4253
01:50:17,290 --> 01:50:17,571
I was going,

4254
01:50:17,571 --> 01:50:17,991
oh my God,

4255
01:50:17,991 --> 01:50:19,830
it's like I'm at the Lou.

4256
01:50:20,060 --> 01:50:23,800
Why remember you had a
program on your laptop,

4257
01:50:23,860 --> 01:50:28,860
this was like 96 you had a program
on your laptop that kept crashing,

4258
01:50:29,470 --> 01:50:33,210
but when it worked it was amazing
because we give you the news as a screen

4259
01:50:33,220 --> 01:50:34,053
saver,

4260
01:50:34,660 --> 01:50:35,800
as a screen saver.

4261
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:40,820
The news would just come up constantly
in a constant flow of news edge with

4262
01:50:40,850 --> 01:50:43,270
technologies and I wish
that still existed.

4263
01:50:43,270 --> 01:50:44,170
It doesn't exist anymore.

4264
01:50:44,200 --> 01:50:45,910
I don't even think it was Wifi.

4265
01:50:45,940 --> 01:50:48,460
I think you owe me again my head,

4266
01:50:48,461 --> 01:50:50,680
an ISD n line in my house,

4267
01:50:51,190 --> 01:50:56,190
I remember which gave me 128 kilobits per
second years ahead of everybody I knew

4268
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:01,300
I had a t one line installed in my house.

4269
01:51:02,380 --> 01:51:03,690
I remember it like it
was like I need those.

4270
01:51:03,700 --> 01:51:04,060
The only,

4271
01:51:04,060 --> 01:51:05,290
I lived in the woods.

4272
01:51:05,291 --> 01:51:09,010
It was the only way I could
get like really high speed
Internet access had carve

4273
01:51:09,011 --> 01:51:11,290
a fucking hole in the ground
and give me a business pipe.

4274
01:51:11,340 --> 01:51:11,770
Amazing.

4275
01:51:11,770 --> 01:51:13,420
Now five g's around the corner,

4276
01:51:13,421 --> 01:51:14,254
man,

4277
01:51:15,440 --> 01:51:16,480
five t's facet.

4278
01:51:16,481 --> 01:51:19,290
If they say it's going to be hundreds
of times faster than everything.

4279
01:51:19,300 --> 01:51:20,133
Again,

4280
01:51:20,340 --> 01:51:21,240
it's,

4281
01:51:21,300 --> 01:51:21,620
yeah,

4282
01:51:21,620 --> 01:51:23,090
it's like to a,

4283
01:51:23,130 --> 01:51:24,760
to a fiber optic link.

4284
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:25,300
Yeah.

4285
01:51:25,300 --> 01:51:25,860
On your phone.

4286
01:51:25,860 --> 01:51:26,290
Yeah.

4287
01:51:26,290 --> 01:51:30,010
I think cds or those are gone now
forever not saved just in case.

4288
01:51:30,720 --> 01:51:31,553
Just to shit.

4289
01:51:31,780 --> 01:51:31,871
Well,

4290
01:51:31,871 --> 01:51:35,200
the real question is like where are we
storing all this stuff if we're only

4291
01:51:35,201 --> 01:51:38,390
storing it in one zero was like we were
talking about the demise of civilization

4292
01:51:38,391 --> 01:51:39,340
and they pass that up.

4293
01:51:39,341 --> 01:51:39,790
Right.

4294
01:51:39,790 --> 01:51:40,623
But that's what,

4295
01:51:40,630 --> 01:51:42,220
that's what probably,

4296
01:51:42,790 --> 01:51:43,091
I mean,

4297
01:51:43,091 --> 01:51:44,350
every society probably,

4298
01:51:44,351 --> 01:51:46,840
I don't think they reached
that 10,000 years ago,

4299
01:51:46,841 --> 01:51:51,400
but I think every society probably reaches
some point where everything is just

4300
01:51:51,401 --> 01:51:53,260
ones and Zeros on a database somewhere,

4301
01:51:53,400 --> 01:51:53,561
but,

4302
01:51:53,561 --> 01:51:54,620
and then it crashes.

4303
01:51:54,680 --> 01:51:55,960
It's a physical place,

4304
01:51:55,961 --> 01:51:56,291
right?

4305
01:51:56,291 --> 01:51:57,730
Where this stuff exists.

4306
01:51:57,790 --> 01:51:57,891
Oh,

4307
01:51:57,891 --> 01:51:58,724
something,

4308
01:51:58,740 --> 01:52:01,660
all our email accounts
exists somewhere was huge.

4309
01:52:01,661 --> 01:52:03,550
Children's with Internet exchanges.

4310
01:52:04,290 --> 01:52:05,123
Sure.

4311
01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:06,120
No,

4312
01:52:06,120 --> 01:52:06,251
no,

4313
01:52:06,251 --> 01:52:07,570
that's absolutely the case.

4314
01:52:07,600 --> 01:52:11,470
But also if something happens
in the grid goes down and we,

4315
01:52:11,680 --> 01:52:13,060
I mean we're hit right?

4316
01:52:13,061 --> 01:52:15,910
If a manatee yeah,

4317
01:52:15,970 --> 01:52:19,360
for sure of what what Dr Robert
Schoch was talking about.

4318
01:52:19,361 --> 01:52:23,650
If there's a fucking lightning storm that
he really torches buildings and starts

4319
01:52:23,651 --> 01:52:24,550
everything on fire,

4320
01:52:24,940 --> 01:52:26,440
good luck accessing all that shit.

4321
01:52:26,590 --> 01:52:27,400
Not only that,

4322
01:52:27,400 --> 01:52:29,710
if human beings just skip a generation,

4323
01:52:29,860 --> 01:52:32,670
like we have a generation
of turmoil and chaos and,

4324
01:52:32,830 --> 01:52:35,050
and then we slowly rebuild civilization.

4325
01:52:35,200 --> 01:52:37,180
How many of those people are
gonna Understand Computer Code?

4326
01:52:37,181 --> 01:52:38,770
How many of these people
are gonna Understand Linux?

4327
01:52:38,950 --> 01:52:42,280
How many of these people that are coming
up without any education from a formal

4328
01:52:42,281 --> 01:52:43,114
university,

4329
01:52:43,300 --> 01:52:46,160
no Internet connection
whatsoever for perhaps

4330
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:46,971
hundreds of years.

4331
01:52:46,971 --> 01:52:49,420
It's like the resetting of
civilization you talked about earlier.

4332
01:52:49,460 --> 01:52:49,860
Exactly.

4333
01:52:49,860 --> 01:52:50,870
Start all over again.

4334
01:52:51,050 --> 01:52:51,950
And that's when the aliens come.

4335
01:52:51,951 --> 01:52:53,240
Cause they know we can't do anything.

4336
01:52:53,241 --> 01:52:55,360
Withdraw Shit on cloud tap type.

4337
01:52:55,750 --> 01:52:56,320
Yeah.

4338
01:52:56,320 --> 01:52:59,360
They wait until we can't take pictures
anymore and then they come back and

4339
01:52:59,400 --> 01:53:00,090
reengineer.

4340
01:53:00,090 --> 01:53:00,530
Yeah.

4341
01:53:00,530 --> 01:53:03,710
Right now they're just relying on the
fact that nobody can frame a shot.

4342
01:53:03,711 --> 01:53:04,544
Well,

4343
01:53:05,680 --> 01:53:09,950
the weirdest thing about the alien
theory was that they came down and

4344
01:53:09,951 --> 01:53:12,800
genetically manipulated lower hominids.

4345
01:53:13,090 --> 01:53:14,870
That's the species.

4346
01:53:14,930 --> 01:53:15,910
That's the weirder ones.

4347
01:53:16,160 --> 01:53:17,330
Or that they are,

4348
01:53:17,360 --> 01:53:17,871
they are,

4349
01:53:17,871 --> 01:53:18,200
uh,

4350
01:53:18,200 --> 01:53:18,321
uh,

4351
01:53:18,321 --> 01:53:21,860
later evolved version of us
coming back to check on us.

4352
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:22,490
Right,

4353
01:53:22,490 --> 01:53:23,050
right.

4354
01:53:23,050 --> 01:53:23,700
Yeah.

4355
01:53:23,700 --> 01:53:24,890
And that's the other thing too,

4356
01:53:24,891 --> 01:53:29,780
is about that archetypal image
of the alien with the gray hair.

4357
01:53:29,790 --> 01:53:32,840
And the big black eyes is that if you go,

4358
01:53:32,870 --> 01:53:34,820
you go down from Australia,

4359
01:53:34,821 --> 01:53:38,300
pithy kiss to home modern homosapien.

4360
01:53:38,330 --> 01:53:39,320
If you make this connect,

4361
01:53:39,500 --> 01:53:41,120
you see this hunched over,

4362
01:53:41,121 --> 01:53:42,470
very hairy,

4363
01:53:42,471 --> 01:53:43,790
almost champ,

4364
01:53:43,791 --> 01:53:46,700
like humanoid and then standing up.

4365
01:53:46,701 --> 01:53:47,090
But,

4366
01:53:47,090 --> 01:53:51,290
but losing all of his hair and the head
is much larger doubling of the human

4367
01:53:51,291 --> 01:53:53,270
brain size over a period
of 2 million years.

4368
01:53:53,460 --> 01:53:53,650
Well,

4369
01:53:53,650 --> 01:53:54,483
where's that going?

4370
01:53:54,680 --> 01:53:55,491
Is that going to keep going?

4371
01:53:55,491 --> 01:53:55,641
Well,

4372
01:53:55,641 --> 01:53:56,270
if it keeps going,

4373
01:53:56,270 --> 01:53:57,110
this is what you're going to get.

4374
01:53:57,111 --> 01:54:00,410
You're gonna get a fee feeble
thing with a giant head.

4375
01:54:00,411 --> 01:54:01,520
And that's what these aliens are.

4376
01:54:01,521 --> 01:54:03,620
They're always feeble with giant heads.

4377
01:54:03,650 --> 01:54:04,250
It's true.

4378
01:54:04,250 --> 01:54:04,820
Yeah.

4379
01:54:04,820 --> 01:54:05,481
Terrible.

4380
01:54:05,481 --> 01:54:06,110
Uh,

4381
01:54:06,110 --> 01:54:06,771
and if they left,

4382
01:54:06,771 --> 01:54:06,981
left,

4383
01:54:06,981 --> 01:54:08,930
they've been living off
earth for a long time.

4384
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:09,470
Yeah.

4385
01:54:09,470 --> 01:54:09,651
Then,

4386
01:54:09,651 --> 01:54:09,831
yeah,

4387
01:54:09,831 --> 01:54:10,361
you're buddies.

4388
01:54:10,361 --> 01:54:10,860
You know,

4389
01:54:10,860 --> 01:54:11,860
they're very out of shape.

4390
01:54:11,960 --> 01:54:12,111
Well,

4391
01:54:12,111 --> 01:54:13,880
they also have no penises or Vaginas,

4392
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:17,160
so they realize that saves a lot of times.

4393
01:54:17,720 --> 01:54:19,160
That gives you time to get stuff done.

4394
01:54:19,220 --> 01:54:19,860
I'm,

4395
01:54:19,860 --> 01:54:22,340
I'm already there and it's
more of a meritocracy.

4396
01:54:22,930 --> 01:54:24,830
You're not banging people
based on their tits and ass.

4397
01:54:25,670 --> 01:54:26,930
You don't have that anymore.

4398
01:54:27,020 --> 01:54:29,090
There's no more that you
just more wasted time.

4399
01:54:29,150 --> 01:54:29,391
Yeah.

4400
01:54:29,391 --> 01:54:32,720
Just sharing your thoughts
transparently through the air.

4401
01:54:32,780 --> 01:54:33,350
No worries.

4402
01:54:33,350 --> 01:54:35,840
You don't need an orb like
in the woody Allen movie.

4403
01:54:36,430 --> 01:54:38,090
Don't even need to pick things up anymore.

4404
01:54:38,091 --> 01:54:39,110
Everything's telekinetic.

4405
01:54:39,170 --> 01:54:39,570
Right.

4406
01:54:39,570 --> 01:54:41,300
Using that giant head to move shit around.

4407
01:54:42,020 --> 01:54:44,420
Never have to leave your
house like your pod.

4408
01:54:44,630 --> 01:54:47,980
There's a guy that
worked supposedly a pan.

4409
01:54:48,040 --> 01:54:50,680
I don't know if you really
worked at area 51 but the,

4410
01:54:50,681 --> 01:54:50,901
the,

4411
01:54:50,901 --> 01:54:51,190
the,

4412
01:54:51,190 --> 01:54:53,450
the whole story was our,

4413
01:54:53,880 --> 01:54:54,713
sorry,

4414
01:54:54,720 --> 01:54:57,230
are good document or is it,

4415
01:54:57,530 --> 01:54:57,920
yeah.

4416
01:54:57,920 --> 01:54:58,191
Yeah.

4417
01:54:58,191 --> 01:54:59,024
It's just one of those,

4418
01:54:59,090 --> 01:54:59,830
it can't,

4419
01:54:59,830 --> 01:55:00,663
we,

4420
01:55:01,230 --> 01:55:02,840
it's just dealing with him
as an individual to go,

4421
01:55:02,841 --> 01:55:03,111
okay,

4422
01:55:03,111 --> 01:55:03,944
this guy isn't,

4423
01:55:04,670 --> 01:55:05,550
he isn't a,

4424
01:55:05,740 --> 01:55:10,370
the firebrand Ufo believer that some
people want them to be and he's not the

4425
01:55:10,371 --> 01:55:11,960
lunatic that other people want it to be.

4426
01:55:12,080 --> 01:55:15,290
But he didn't tell the
truth about his education.

4427
01:55:15,291 --> 01:55:15,501
Right.

4428
01:55:15,501 --> 01:55:16,251
Isn't that the case?

4429
01:55:16,251 --> 01:55:16,460
There's isn't.

4430
01:55:16,460 --> 01:55:16,970
There's some,

4431
01:55:16,970 --> 01:55:18,380
some finagling about,

4432
01:55:18,530 --> 01:55:18,921
yeah.

4433
01:55:18,921 --> 01:55:21,050
Well definitely like the
records of his education,

4434
01:55:21,110 --> 01:55:21,501
if they,

4435
01:55:21,501 --> 01:55:22,670
if he was telling the truth,

4436
01:55:22,671 --> 01:55:24,380
those records aren't around anymore.

4437
01:55:24,740 --> 01:55:25,011
Right?

4438
01:55:25,011 --> 01:55:25,280
Yeah.

4439
01:55:25,280 --> 01:55:26,450
So if he was telling the truth,

4440
01:55:26,451 --> 01:55:28,190
somebody expunged and yet,

4441
01:55:28,250 --> 01:55:28,611
and he's,

4442
01:55:28,611 --> 01:55:29,361
and he's basically,

4443
01:55:29,361 --> 01:55:30,021
his argument is,

4444
01:55:30,021 --> 01:55:30,740
well,

4445
01:55:30,740 --> 01:55:32,270
if I didn't have this education,

4446
01:55:32,630 --> 01:55:35,180
why was I hired to do this job?

4447
01:55:35,210 --> 01:55:35,960
Right.

4448
01:55:35,960 --> 01:55:36,793
You know,

4449
01:55:36,860 --> 01:55:37,101
I mean,

4450
01:55:37,101 --> 01:55:39,400
I was hired to do this
research by the government and,

4451
01:55:39,470 --> 01:55:42,080
and they have their records
of me doing the research.

4452
01:55:42,770 --> 01:55:45,480
So why did they let me do this research
for all these years if I didn't have the

4453
01:55:45,481 --> 01:55:46,410
education to do it?

4454
01:55:46,650 --> 01:55:48,600
But wouldn't there be someone
that went to school with him?

4455
01:55:48,780 --> 01:55:49,290
Like,

4456
01:55:49,290 --> 01:55:49,770
don't you,

4457
01:55:49,770 --> 01:55:50,770
you have friends from high school,

4458
01:55:50,771 --> 01:55:51,210
right?

4459
01:55:51,210 --> 01:55:51,451
Well,

4460
01:55:51,451 --> 01:55:52,190
not many.

4461
01:55:52,190 --> 01:55:52,410
Well,

4462
01:55:52,410 --> 01:55:52,770
I,

4463
01:55:52,770 --> 01:55:54,930
I do have some friends they can go,

4464
01:55:54,931 --> 01:55:55,470
yeah,

4465
01:55:55,470 --> 01:55:55,681
no,

4466
01:55:55,681 --> 01:55:55,970
yeah.

4467
01:55:55,970 --> 01:55:56,761
In fifth grade English.

4468
01:55:56,761 --> 01:55:57,594
And you bro.

4469
01:55:57,820 --> 01:55:58,770
And I got a couple of,

4470
01:55:58,900 --> 01:56:01,590
wasn't there a guy who went to
college with bibles are gonna say,

4471
01:56:01,591 --> 01:56:01,891
yeah,

4472
01:56:01,891 --> 01:56:03,480
he's in physics one o one.

4473
01:56:03,481 --> 01:56:04,314
Which he's out there.

4474
01:56:04,470 --> 01:56:05,160
Yeah.

4475
01:56:05,160 --> 01:56:06,120
I think there aren't people.

4476
01:56:06,450 --> 01:56:06,840
Yeah.

4477
01:56:06,840 --> 01:56:07,051
Yeah.

4478
01:56:07,051 --> 01:56:07,884
They remember him.

4479
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:08,220
Okay,

4480
01:56:08,220 --> 01:56:08,910
cool.

4481
01:56:08,910 --> 01:56:09,351
So you,

4482
01:56:09,351 --> 01:56:10,440
you enjoyed the documentary.

4483
01:56:10,441 --> 01:56:11,520
Do you remember what the name of it is?

4484
01:56:11,820 --> 01:56:12,680
Uh,

4485
01:56:12,710 --> 01:56:12,990
what?

4486
01:56:12,990 --> 01:56:13,471
Oh God,

4487
01:56:13,471 --> 01:56:14,041
what is it called?

4488
01:56:14,041 --> 01:56:15,890
Bob Lewis are the guy who,

4489
01:56:15,900 --> 01:56:16,320
uh,

4490
01:56:16,320 --> 01:56:16,771
it's a new,

4491
01:56:16,771 --> 01:56:16,981

4492
01:56:16,981 --> 01:56:17,460
yeah,

4493
01:56:17,460 --> 01:56:18,810
somebody emailed me about that.

4494
01:56:19,180 --> 01:56:19,471
I'll say it.

4495
01:56:19,471 --> 01:56:20,304
And the guy who made it,

4496
01:56:20,340 --> 01:56:21,060
that's a real problem.

4497
01:56:21,060 --> 01:56:21,930
Like Ufo,

4498
01:56:22,080 --> 01:56:24,630
even this one is a fairly
rational documentary,

4499
01:56:24,631 --> 01:56:25,290
but it's,

4500
01:56:25,290 --> 01:56:26,123
uh,

4501
01:56:27,090 --> 01:56:28,170
but there's so bad.

4502
01:56:29,010 --> 01:56:29,461
Even this one,

4503
01:56:29,461 --> 01:56:29,910
it's just,

4504
01:56:29,910 --> 01:56:31,830
it's just got just bad filmmaking.

4505
01:56:32,220 --> 01:56:32,840
You know?

4506
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:35,670
Bobby's our area 51 and flying saucers.

4507
01:56:36,030 --> 01:56:36,863
That's the,

4508
01:56:37,010 --> 01:56:38,940
the title 4.1.

4509
01:56:38,970 --> 01:56:39,390
That's it.

4510
01:56:39,390 --> 01:56:40,050
Uh,

4511
01:56:40,050 --> 01:56:41,190
Jeremy Cor.

4512
01:56:41,191 --> 01:56:41,950
Bill.

4513
01:56:41,950 --> 01:56:42,250
Yeah.

4514
01:56:42,250 --> 01:56:43,410
I think he's the gentleman.

4515
01:56:43,440 --> 01:56:43,711
Yeah.

4516
01:56:43,711 --> 01:56:44,720
And it's really accepted it all.

4517
01:56:44,780 --> 01:56:47,020
But it has like Mickey
Rourke doing voiceovers,

4518
01:56:48,080 --> 01:56:49,720
voiceovers at some point.

4519
01:56:49,730 --> 01:56:50,970
I love it as the wrestler,

4520
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:55,800
a barfly so doing it as book
Koski that would be fine.

4521
01:56:55,830 --> 01:56:57,540
It's got 20% on rotten tomatoes,

4522
01:56:57,930 --> 01:57:01,400
but it's a movie with
your fucking you of Oh,

4523
01:57:01,440 --> 01:57:02,460
but I mean you've seen,

4524
01:57:04,050 --> 01:57:04,883
you've seen the,

4525
01:57:05,190 --> 01:57:06,023
um,

4526
01:57:06,510 --> 01:57:07,470
I know what I saw.

4527
01:57:07,471 --> 01:57:08,460
And out of the blue,

4528
01:57:08,500 --> 01:57:09,333
those documentaries,

4529
01:57:09,780 --> 01:57:11,430
you haven't seen it
because those are great.

4530
01:57:11,880 --> 01:57:13,350
Are they out of the blue is a great,

4531
01:57:13,410 --> 01:57:15,530
serious documentary
about the UFO phenomena.

4532
01:57:15,531 --> 01:57:15,801
And,

4533
01:57:15,801 --> 01:57:18,960
and I know what I saw is
one sort of tracing the,

4534
01:57:18,961 --> 01:57:19,794
uh,

4535
01:57:20,010 --> 01:57:21,060
the participants in the,

4536
01:57:21,061 --> 01:57:21,930
uh,

4537
01:57:21,960 --> 01:57:25,740
the disclosure hearings at
the Press Club in Washington.

4538
01:57:25,800 --> 01:57:26,041
God,

4539
01:57:26,041 --> 01:57:26,841
you're going to bring me back in.

4540
01:57:26,841 --> 01:57:27,330
And the Shit,

4541
01:57:27,330 --> 01:57:27,630
yeah,

4542
01:57:27,630 --> 01:57:28,560
I love the man.

4543
01:57:28,561 --> 01:57:29,610
I really wish they were real.

4544
01:57:29,611 --> 01:57:32,430
But I'm telling you my experience
talking to these people.

4545
01:57:32,430 --> 01:57:34,160
When I did that Scifi show,

4546
01:57:34,161 --> 01:57:34,500
I was like,

4547
01:57:34,500 --> 01:57:34,710
oh,

4548
01:57:34,710 --> 01:57:36,150
this is all nonsense.

4549
01:57:36,510 --> 01:57:37,050
Yeah.

4550
01:57:37,050 --> 01:57:37,883
But again,

4551
01:57:38,910 --> 01:57:41,160
that maybe those people were nonsense.

4552
01:57:41,550 --> 01:57:43,770
But the train military,

4553
01:57:45,360 --> 01:57:46,350
air traffic controllers,

4554
01:57:46,351 --> 01:57:47,184
the pilots,

4555
01:57:47,410 --> 01:57:48,243
yeah.

4556
01:57:48,540 --> 01:57:49,560
Government officials.

4557
01:57:49,561 --> 01:57:49,821
Like,

4558
01:57:49,821 --> 01:57:50,310
uh,

4559
01:57:50,310 --> 01:57:50,821
what's his name?

4560
01:57:50,821 --> 01:57:51,590
Fif.

4561
01:57:51,590 --> 01:57:52,380
Uh,

4562
01:57:52,380 --> 01:57:54,990
the governor of Arizona
is one of the guys in,

4563
01:57:54,991 --> 01:57:55,561
I know what I saw.

4564
01:57:55,561 --> 01:57:56,394
And out of the blue.

4565
01:57:56,400 --> 01:57:56,671
Oh yeah.

4566
01:57:56,671 --> 01:58:00,010
He was the king either
was told to like mock it,

4567
01:58:00,220 --> 01:58:01,050
brought it out,

4568
01:58:01,050 --> 01:58:03,430
guy dressed like alien.

4569
01:58:03,870 --> 01:58:04,320
These documents,

4570
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:06,900
he talks about how much he
deeply regrets doing that.

4571
01:58:06,901 --> 01:58:07,980
And this is from out of the blue?

4572
01:58:08,070 --> 01:58:08,370
Yeah,

4573
01:58:08,370 --> 01:58:09,570
really interesting.

4574
01:58:09,810 --> 01:58:10,380
Deeply grip.

4575
01:58:10,380 --> 01:58:12,250
Maybe now it was not a governor anymore.

4576
01:58:12,251 --> 01:58:13,650
I was trying to get a
new angle and his career.

4577
01:58:13,860 --> 01:58:14,670
But he basically said,

4578
01:58:14,670 --> 01:58:15,503
you know what,

4579
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:19,740
tens of thousands of people
saw these craft and we lied.

4580
01:58:19,950 --> 01:58:20,470
We came out,

4581
01:58:20,470 --> 01:58:21,303
we lied.

4582
01:58:21,650 --> 01:58:24,300
And he did he say who directed him to lie?

4583
01:58:24,690 --> 01:58:25,171
He didn't really,

4584
01:58:25,171 --> 01:58:26,450
he didn't say he was really directed dude.

4585
01:58:26,451 --> 01:58:30,210
He said he felt like people were in a
state of panic and he thought he could

4586
01:58:30,211 --> 01:58:32,940
relieve some of the fear
by making a joke of it.

4587
01:58:32,941 --> 01:58:37,470
And he said he really regret he really
just wanted to make relax people cause he

4588
01:58:37,471 --> 01:58:37,681
didn't,

4589
01:58:37,681 --> 01:58:38,730
he didn't know what else to do.

4590
01:58:38,731 --> 01:58:39,390
He said he didn't,

4591
01:58:39,390 --> 01:58:40,050
he said,

4592
01:58:40,050 --> 01:58:40,883
I saw it,

4593
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:41,890
everyone else saw it.

4594
01:58:42,580 --> 01:58:43,413
And uh,

4595
01:58:43,420 --> 01:58:44,890
I didn't know how to calm people down.

4596
01:58:45,100 --> 01:58:49,570
So I made this joke and he
said he regrets it to this day.

4597
01:58:49,610 --> 01:58:54,410
There's another thing about these UFO
experiences and alien experiences where

4598
01:58:54,411 --> 01:58:55,730
people really dive into them.

4599
01:58:55,731 --> 01:58:57,920
Third seems to be the AC,

4600
01:58:57,921 --> 01:59:00,860
the atheists version of religion
to a lot of these folks.

4601
01:59:00,861 --> 01:59:01,510
Yeah,

4602
01:59:01,510 --> 01:59:02,230
yeah.

4603
01:59:02,230 --> 01:59:02,861
Which again,

4604
01:59:02,861 --> 01:59:03,130
I,

4605
01:59:03,130 --> 01:59:04,240
that I dismiss,

4606
01:59:04,270 --> 01:59:04,960
you know?

4607
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:05,560
Yeah.

4608
01:59:05,560 --> 01:59:08,860
I don't think that's
likely to be the case.

4609
01:59:08,861 --> 01:59:11,080
That they're here to
save us or they're not.

4610
01:59:11,800 --> 01:59:12,050
No,

4611
01:59:12,050 --> 01:59:12,883
no,

4612
01:59:13,100 --> 01:59:13,430
no.

4613
01:59:13,430 --> 01:59:13,940
I mean that,

4614
01:59:13,940 --> 01:59:14,211
I mean,

4615
01:59:14,211 --> 01:59:16,190
the people that are believers
that are really into it,

4616
01:59:16,220 --> 01:59:20,030
it seems to be that instead
of focusing on a deity,

4617
01:59:20,031 --> 01:59:22,380
they're focusing on an alien civilization.

4618
01:59:22,381 --> 01:59:23,510
Transferring it to

4619
01:59:25,120 --> 01:59:26,930
daddy will save us.

4620
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:27,350
Yeah.

4621
01:59:27,350 --> 01:59:31,170
That when we decide to point those nuclear
weapons at each other and you know,

4622
01:59:31,190 --> 01:59:33,680
it's going to come down and they'll
come down at the last minute,

4623
01:59:33,770 --> 01:59:37,290
talked to Russia and Trump and what's not

4624
01:59:37,750 --> 01:59:38,583
right.

4625
01:59:38,590 --> 01:59:39,090
Yeah,

4626
01:59:39,090 --> 01:59:39,510
yeah.

4627
01:59:39,510 --> 01:59:40,310
It's that,

4628
01:59:40,310 --> 01:59:42,600
but where were they
during her Shima Nagasaki.

4629
01:59:43,060 --> 01:59:43,893
Yeah.

4630
01:59:44,370 --> 01:59:46,720
Watching everybody deserves a lunch break,

4631
01:59:46,900 --> 01:59:48,500
but whoever,

4632
01:59:48,740 --> 01:59:51,090
whatever's going on that
it's not an intervention.

4633
01:59:51,240 --> 01:59:51,391
Well,

4634
01:59:51,391 --> 01:59:51,631
you know,

4635
01:59:51,631 --> 01:59:56,631
right after worth a right afterwards
was when a giant swarm of Ufo sightings

4636
01:59:58,021 --> 02:00:00,780
happened right after the
nuclear bombs were dropped.

4637
02:00:01,230 --> 02:00:01,501
Yeah.

4638
02:00:01,501 --> 02:00:02,400
That's when the,

4639
02:00:02,401 --> 02:00:06,270
there's a big uptick in Ufo
sightings and a lot of the,

4640
02:00:06,330 --> 02:00:06,481
yeah,

4641
02:00:06,481 --> 02:00:06,931
and as you said,

4642
02:00:06,931 --> 02:00:09,780
a lot of the incidents are
at nuclear missile sites.

4643
02:00:10,170 --> 02:00:12,210
They're getting going for
fuel or something like that.

4644
02:00:12,240 --> 02:00:12,391
Well,

4645
02:00:12,391 --> 02:00:12,691
they've,

4646
02:00:12,691 --> 02:00:12,991
they've,

4647
02:00:12,991 --> 02:00:13,440
uh,

4648
02:00:13,440 --> 02:00:16,410
I mean there's the one
in Arizona somewhere.

4649
02:00:16,420 --> 02:00:16,710
They,

4650
02:00:16,710 --> 02:00:21,120
they were Ufo showed up and shut
down the entire lunch system.

4651
02:00:22,050 --> 02:00:22,171
They,

4652
02:00:22,171 --> 02:00:22,411
all,

4653
02:00:22,411 --> 02:00:24,450
the missiles went
offline at the same time.

4654
02:00:24,810 --> 02:00:25,171
And it's,

4655
02:00:25,171 --> 02:00:25,381
you know,

4656
02:00:25,381 --> 02:00:28,080
and it's documented and it's
in the records of the time.

4657
02:00:28,220 --> 02:00:31,650
Don't dump all of the
missiles went offline.

4658
02:00:31,770 --> 02:00:33,480
You don't seem has never done this.

4659
02:00:33,980 --> 02:00:34,813
I,

4660
02:00:35,490 --> 02:00:37,500
I am literally right in the middle.

4661
02:00:37,950 --> 02:00:40,920
That's where I live on this
thing is I really don't know.

4662
02:00:41,190 --> 02:00:43,080
I'm not quite in the middle.

4663
02:00:43,081 --> 02:00:43,770
I'm in the,

4664
02:00:43,770 --> 02:00:45,810
I desperately want it to be real,

4665
02:00:46,350 --> 02:00:47,183
but um,

4666
02:00:47,470 --> 02:00:48,303
I'm still,

4667
02:00:48,430 --> 02:00:49,620
I'm calling bullshit.

4668
02:00:49,660 --> 02:00:50,450
Yeah.

4669
02:00:50,450 --> 02:00:50,820
I guess,

4670
02:00:50,820 --> 02:00:51,900
I guess I'm edging,

4671
02:00:52,020 --> 02:00:53,190
but my desire,

4672
02:00:53,370 --> 02:00:55,110
my desire is towards reality.

4673
02:00:55,130 --> 02:00:58,230
I want it to land as
came out as a big foot.

4674
02:00:58,231 --> 02:00:59,064
That bothered me.

4675
02:00:59,160 --> 02:00:59,660
He really,

4676
02:00:59,660 --> 02:01:00,493
yeah.

4677
02:01:00,630 --> 02:01:01,950
He came out as a big foot believer.

4678
02:01:02,130 --> 02:01:02,371
No,

4679
02:01:02,371 --> 02:01:03,600
he came out as the guy in the suit.

4680
02:01:03,790 --> 02:01:04,940
Oh yeah.

4681
02:01:04,950 --> 02:01:05,550
Remember that?

4682
02:01:05,550 --> 02:01:05,911
No,

4683
02:01:05,911 --> 02:01:06,840
that's just a lie.

4684
02:01:07,210 --> 02:01:08,043
What did you do then?

4685
02:01:08,060 --> 02:01:11,070
It about five or six from
Harry and the Hendersons.

4686
02:01:11,071 --> 02:01:11,904
That suit?

4687
02:01:11,970 --> 02:01:12,600
No,

4688
02:01:12,600 --> 02:01:14,190
this is him and his college friends.

4689
02:01:14,220 --> 02:01:16,830
They made there the big foot
and the in the famous video.

4690
02:01:16,960 --> 02:01:18,010
No,

4691
02:01:18,040 --> 02:01:18,671
that's Bob.

4692
02:01:18,671 --> 02:01:18,941
No,

4693
02:01:18,941 --> 02:01:20,130
that's Bob Herana.

4694
02:01:20,240 --> 02:01:21,390
Miss land us.

4695
02:01:21,410 --> 02:01:21,611
No,

4696
02:01:21,611 --> 02:01:21,761
no,

4697
02:01:21,761 --> 02:01:22,000
no.

4698
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:23,350
There's a video of Bob.

4699
02:01:23,380 --> 02:01:24,061
Bob Herana.

4700
02:01:24,061 --> 02:01:25,150
Miss was friends with the,

4701
02:01:25,420 --> 02:01:25,870
so that,

4702
02:01:25,870 --> 02:01:26,800
that story,

4703
02:01:26,801 --> 02:01:30,490
that big foot store is a real problem
because that's the Robert the Patterson

4704
02:01:30,491 --> 02:01:31,270
film.

4705
02:01:31,270 --> 02:01:35,590
Paterson was a con man who went
to jail for writing a bad check.

4706
02:01:35,591 --> 02:01:36,880
The paid for the very camera.

4707
02:01:36,881 --> 02:01:38,090
He used to film big foot.

4708
02:01:38,260 --> 02:01:40,120
He went out looking to film bigfoot.

4709
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:40,430
Yeah.

4710
02:01:40,430 --> 02:01:42,050
They had a fucking suit.

4711
02:01:42,160 --> 02:01:42,411
I mean,

4712
02:01:42,411 --> 02:01:43,730
he was trying to get a suit.

4713
02:01:43,731 --> 02:01:44,331
They got a guy,

4714
02:01:44,331 --> 02:01:48,000
Bob Herano says a big tall
guy who walks like bigfoot.

4715
02:01:48,350 --> 02:01:50,090
Here's a video of yes,

4716
02:01:50,240 --> 02:01:51,200
the Patterson footage.

4717
02:01:51,320 --> 02:01:56,320
If there's a bit video that superimposes
Bob Herana Miss Walking on one side and

4718
02:01:57,321 --> 02:01:58,960
big foot on the other side walk the same.

4719
02:01:59,020 --> 02:02:00,130
Hey fucking this is,

4720
02:02:00,150 --> 02:02:01,040
it's the guy.

4721
02:02:01,080 --> 02:02:01,913
It's him.

4722
02:02:01,940 --> 02:02:02,661
And by the way,

4723
02:02:02,661 --> 02:02:05,540
big foot looks like a
guy in a big foot suit.

4724
02:02:05,550 --> 02:02:07,840
There's not a fucking
animal on the planet.

4725
02:02:07,850 --> 02:02:11,090
It looks like a person in an animal suit
and you never look at a swan and go,

4726
02:02:11,091 --> 02:02:11,281
hey,

4727
02:02:11,281 --> 02:02:12,700
that looks like a person who a swan suit.

4728
02:02:12,890 --> 02:02:13,723
Nope.

4729
02:02:13,790 --> 02:02:15,470
Things that like,

4730
02:02:15,590 --> 02:02:17,000
if you see a gorilla,

4731
02:02:17,030 --> 02:02:19,470
it does not look like a
person in a gorilla suit.

4732
02:02:20,580 --> 02:02:21,413
Totally out.

4733
02:02:21,570 --> 02:02:23,090
The anatomy is different.

4734
02:02:23,210 --> 02:02:25,430
That's the same with this
fucking stupid footage.

4735
02:02:25,640 --> 02:02:28,820
It's so dumb that the people
that buy in to them believe it.

4736
02:02:28,821 --> 02:02:29,270
It's like,

4737
02:02:29,270 --> 02:02:29,810
come on,

4738
02:02:29,810 --> 02:02:30,710
just look at it.

4739
02:02:31,330 --> 02:02:32,450
And it was always,

4740
02:02:32,451 --> 02:02:33,284
it was always,

4741
02:02:33,770 --> 02:02:34,790
see if you could find that footage.

4742
02:02:34,840 --> 02:02:35,150
Yeah.

4743
02:02:35,150 --> 02:02:40,150
Bob Herana Miss Ne Right next
to Bob Herana miss as big foot.

4744
02:02:41,030 --> 02:02:41,541
I mean there's a,

4745
02:02:41,541 --> 02:02:46,541
there's a video on youtube where they
show the stabilized image of this animal

4746
02:02:46,731 --> 02:02:47,720
moving across the,

4747
02:02:47,730 --> 02:02:47,991
and I,

4748
02:02:47,991 --> 02:02:48,411
by the way,

4749
02:02:48,411 --> 02:02:52,340
I've been to that area where they saw
that thing that's really interesting cause

4750
02:02:52,341 --> 02:02:53,510
it's in your show that yet.

4751
02:02:53,510 --> 02:02:56,920
But there's still like people like
anthropologists who will still say the,

4752
02:02:57,020 --> 02:02:57,321
you know,

4753
02:02:57,321 --> 02:03:01,520
that there's clear evidence that Kendall
and structure of this big foot fucking

4754
02:03:01,540 --> 02:03:01,960
sanctuary,

4755
02:03:01,960 --> 02:03:03,080
it doesn't match human.

4756
02:03:03,270 --> 02:03:05,040
If there's a single
thing that makes sense,

4757
02:03:05,041 --> 02:03:05,590
the vibe,

4758
02:03:05,590 --> 02:03:06,060
I mean it's there,

4759
02:03:06,060 --> 02:03:07,490
but it's not a single thing.

4760
02:03:08,330 --> 02:03:09,163
Yeah.

4761
02:03:09,190 --> 02:03:10,023
There has to be community.

4762
02:03:10,330 --> 02:03:11,390
The compelling,

4763
02:03:11,480 --> 02:03:15,230
interesting aspect of big foot is
that there was an animal called

4764
02:03:15,231 --> 02:03:19,640
gigantopithecus that existed as recently
as a hundred thousand years ago,

4765
02:03:19,641 --> 02:03:24,440
and they found teeth in the 1920s and
apothecary shop and China that we're an

4766
02:03:24,470 --> 02:03:25,700
unknown hominid.

4767
02:03:26,030 --> 02:03:26,930
And then they were like,

4768
02:03:26,931 --> 02:03:27,830
where'd you get these?

4769
02:03:27,831 --> 02:03:31,610
And then they found the area where they
found them and they started discovering

4770
02:03:31,611 --> 02:03:32,001
more.

4771
02:03:32,001 --> 02:03:33,590
And they've found some job,

4772
02:03:33,591 --> 02:03:36,170
bone fragments and some various bones.

4773
02:03:36,190 --> 02:03:36,740
He see this,

4774
02:03:36,740 --> 02:03:37,430
look at this,

4775
02:03:37,430 --> 02:03:38,180
look at that guy.

4776
02:03:38,180 --> 02:03:39,013
Oh my God.

4777
02:03:39,050 --> 02:03:40,880
I mean get the funk out.

4778
02:03:40,940 --> 02:03:41,450
Amazing.

4779
02:03:41,450 --> 02:03:43,160
That's the guy that's amazing.

4780
02:03:43,161 --> 02:03:43,820
That's him.

4781
02:03:43,820 --> 02:03:44,580
And he admits it.

4782
02:03:44,580 --> 02:03:45,413
Yes.

4783
02:03:45,480 --> 02:03:45,950
Yes.

4784
02:03:45,950 --> 02:03:46,610
Same.

4785
02:03:46,610 --> 02:03:48,110
He admits it and got to talk to him.

4786
02:03:48,120 --> 02:03:51,050
It's fucking him talked about it.

4787
02:03:51,051 --> 02:03:51,800
He said,

4788
02:03:51,800 --> 02:03:52,760
told the story.

4789
02:03:52,761 --> 02:03:53,211
They said,

4790
02:03:53,211 --> 02:03:53,541
all right,

4791
02:03:53,541 --> 02:03:53,781
ready.

4792
02:03:53,781 --> 02:03:55,340
Go start walking on shape.

4793
02:03:55,370 --> 02:03:56,240
Exactly.

4794
02:03:56,420 --> 02:04:01,420
So put that guy in a big old
stupid fucking furry suit
and you have big foot and

4795
02:04:02,120 --> 02:04:02,841
that's great.

4796
02:04:02,841 --> 02:04:04,070
It's 100% him.

4797
02:04:04,310 --> 02:04:05,143
Um,

4798
02:04:05,330 --> 02:04:07,010
so does that mean there's
not one out there?

4799
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:07,251
No.

4800
02:04:07,251 --> 02:04:11,060
So Jai can't apathic this was a real
animal that they think was a bipedal

4801
02:04:11,061 --> 02:04:16,061
hominid that lived somewhere around a
hundred thousand years ago for sure.

4802
02:04:16,190 --> 02:04:20,240
But most likely coincide lived
alongside human beings for eons.

4803
02:04:20,241 --> 02:04:20,870
Right.

4804
02:04:20,870 --> 02:04:24,520
And this thing was an eight
to 10 foot tall and North Sea.

4805
02:04:24,540 --> 02:04:24,801
She,

4806
02:04:24,801 --> 02:04:26,090
if you get an image of,

4807
02:04:26,091 --> 02:04:26,420
um,

4808
02:04:26,420 --> 02:04:31,420
the photo of a recreation of a Chai
can't tow pikas next to a modern human

4809
02:04:32,451 --> 02:04:32,660
being.

4810
02:04:32,660 --> 02:04:33,493
It's really interesting.

4811
02:04:33,710 --> 02:04:35,300
It was huge.

4812
02:04:35,410 --> 02:04:38,730
A huge buy fossil record of it.

4813
02:04:38,780 --> 02:04:39,590
It's a real thing.

4814
02:04:39,590 --> 02:04:39,900
Yeah.

4815
02:04:39,900 --> 02:04:40,051
Yeah.

4816
02:04:40,051 --> 02:04:40,980
I mean it makes sense.

4817
02:04:40,981 --> 02:04:41,814
Like if a gorilla,

4818
02:04:41,830 --> 02:04:42,030
we would,

4819
02:04:42,030 --> 02:04:43,770
it was a girl was like 500 pounds.

4820
02:04:43,771 --> 02:04:43,951
I mean,

4821
02:04:43,951 --> 02:04:48,030
the gorillas are considered
mythical creatures until like 18,

4822
02:04:48,031 --> 02:04:48,750
19.

4823
02:04:48,750 --> 02:04:48,871
Oh,

4824
02:04:48,871 --> 02:04:49,411
scroll up,

4825
02:04:49,411 --> 02:04:49,711
Jamie.

4826
02:04:49,711 --> 02:04:51,480
There's a better image right above you,

4827
02:04:51,880 --> 02:04:55,590
or was it even the 1900 says grills were
first just like officially discovered

4828
02:04:55,680 --> 02:04:55,921
does.

4829
02:04:55,921 --> 02:04:59,430
So there's a better one
where that shows up with the,

4830
02:04:59,440 --> 02:05:01,620
the fake bigfoot wrapped around his

4831
02:05:03,290 --> 02:05:04,123
keeps crawling.

4832
02:05:04,860 --> 02:05:05,191
There's,

4833
02:05:05,191 --> 02:05:06,024
uh,

4834
02:05:06,260 --> 02:05:06,531
that,

4835
02:05:06,531 --> 02:05:06,630
uh,

4836
02:05:06,630 --> 02:05:06,940
that,

4837
02:05:06,940 --> 02:05:07,650
that's a good one.

4838
02:05:07,650 --> 02:05:07,861
Yeah,

4839
02:05:07,861 --> 02:05:08,370
there is,

4840
02:05:08,370 --> 02:05:09,090
that's the guy.

4841
02:05:09,090 --> 02:05:09,780
That's the guy.

4842
02:05:09,780 --> 02:05:11,280
So that's what that thing looked like.

4843
02:05:11,590 --> 02:05:12,900
So if you saw that in the woods,

4844
02:05:12,901 --> 02:05:13,201
you'd be like,

4845
02:05:13,201 --> 02:05:14,910
holy fuck and shit.

4846
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:15,480
Hell yeah.

4847
02:05:15,480 --> 02:05:16,380
Eight foot tall,

4848
02:05:16,381 --> 02:05:19,650
gigantic hairy ape creature.

4849
02:05:19,710 --> 02:05:21,510
I wouldn't touch it like
that guys touching on.

4850
02:05:21,530 --> 02:05:22,363
He's a plant.

4851
02:05:22,530 --> 02:05:23,363
That's his buddy.

4852
02:05:24,030 --> 02:05:27,530
It's like when you see dudes
from Russia with bears and shit,

4853
02:05:29,040 --> 02:05:29,191
but,

4854
02:05:29,191 --> 02:05:30,330
so that's a real animal.

4855
02:05:30,331 --> 02:05:35,310
So that's probably why there's so many
mythological stories about this thing.

4856
02:05:35,311 --> 02:05:38,160
And the native Americans have more than
a hundred different names for these

4857
02:05:38,161 --> 02:05:41,700
creatures along the various tribes
signed that they thought was extinct for

4858
02:05:41,740 --> 02:05:42,573
around,

4859
02:05:42,820 --> 02:05:43,560
yeah.

4860
02:05:43,560 --> 02:05:44,393
Yeah.

4861
02:05:44,630 --> 02:05:46,200
Armored plated fish,

4862
02:05:46,270 --> 02:05:46,710
right?

4863
02:05:46,710 --> 02:05:46,921
Yeah.

4864
02:05:46,921 --> 02:05:47,341
I mean there's,

4865
02:05:47,341 --> 02:05:50,760
there's a lot of animals that mean
that's cryptozoology in a nutshell.

4866
02:05:51,120 --> 02:05:53,970
There's a lot of animals that we think
are extinct that probably aren't,

4867
02:05:53,971 --> 02:05:55,860
but that one is very unlikely one,

4868
02:05:56,370 --> 02:05:57,060
cause it's,

4869
02:05:57,060 --> 02:05:57,451
you know,

4870
02:05:57,451 --> 02:05:59,790
it needed an enormous supply of food.

4871
02:05:59,791 --> 02:06:00,050
Yeah.

4872
02:06:00,050 --> 02:06:00,540
Yeah.

4873
02:06:00,540 --> 02:06:01,500
I mean it's a huge,

4874
02:06:01,501 --> 02:06:02,340
huge animal.

4875
02:06:02,360 --> 02:06:02,910
Yeah.

4876
02:06:02,910 --> 02:06:07,770
But the thing about it is
that the sightings occur all
in the Pacific northwest,

4877
02:06:07,980 --> 02:06:10,340
which if you follow the Bering land mass,

4878
02:06:10,620 --> 02:06:13,080
that's where they would have come across.

4879
02:06:13,080 --> 02:06:14,730
If they came across with humans,

4880
02:06:14,731 --> 02:06:18,030
they would've come across into Alaska
where there's a lot of sightings and down

4881
02:06:18,031 --> 02:06:20,180
into the Pacific northwest where
there's a lot of sightings.

4882
02:06:20,400 --> 02:06:20,620
Yeah.

4883
02:06:20,620 --> 02:06:22,230
But there's sightings
all over the country now.

4884
02:06:22,530 --> 02:06:25,470
But is there any fossil record
outside of Africa specific?

4885
02:06:25,480 --> 02:06:25,860
I get up.

4886
02:06:25,860 --> 02:06:26,490
I think it's new.

4887
02:06:26,490 --> 02:06:26,700
No,

4888
02:06:26,700 --> 02:06:26,971
no,

4889
02:06:26,971 --> 02:06:27,480
there's not.

4890
02:06:27,480 --> 02:06:27,691
No,

4891
02:06:27,691 --> 02:06:28,410
there's not.

4892
02:06:28,410 --> 02:06:29,243
Yeah.

4893
02:06:29,310 --> 02:06:29,551
Yeah.

4894
02:06:29,551 --> 02:06:29,970
It's all,

4895
02:06:29,970 --> 02:06:31,410
it's a Asia actually.

4896
02:06:31,560 --> 02:06:33,030
Asia is where they find them.

4897
02:06:33,090 --> 02:06:33,271
Yeah.

4898
02:06:33,271 --> 02:06:34,104
It's not even Africa.

4899
02:06:34,620 --> 02:06:35,520
Ironically.

4900
02:06:36,810 --> 02:06:37,643
Yes.

4901
02:06:37,890 --> 02:06:38,723
Asians are tiny.

4902
02:06:38,990 --> 02:06:39,410
Oh,

4903
02:06:39,410 --> 02:06:39,660
right.

4904
02:06:39,660 --> 02:06:40,110
Tiny piece.

4905
02:06:40,110 --> 02:06:40,500
Well,

4906
02:06:40,500 --> 02:06:41,251
it's not a person,

4907
02:06:41,251 --> 02:06:42,084
not this one.

4908
02:06:42,300 --> 02:06:42,601
It's,

4909
02:06:42,601 --> 02:06:43,170
um,

4910
02:06:43,170 --> 02:06:43,680
it's,

4911
02:06:43,680 --> 02:06:47,250
it's compelling in the sense that
there was a bunch of different kinds of

4912
02:06:47,251 --> 02:06:48,870
hominids that existed.

4913
02:06:49,150 --> 02:06:49,690
You know,

4914
02:06:49,690 --> 02:06:50,230
the,

4915
02:06:50,230 --> 02:06:53,010
we now know that we
interbred with neanderthals.

4916
02:06:53,080 --> 02:06:53,480
Yeah.

4917
02:06:53,480 --> 02:06:53,920
Yeah.

4918
02:06:53,920 --> 02:06:54,480
That's,

4919
02:06:54,480 --> 02:06:56,940
most of us have Mandy total DNA in us.

4920
02:06:56,990 --> 02:06:57,480
Yup.

4921
02:06:57,480 --> 02:06:57,630
Well,

4922
02:06:57,630 --> 02:06:58,770
most white folks,

4923
02:06:59,040 --> 02:06:59,790
um,

4924
02:06:59,790 --> 02:07:00,630
which is interesting,

4925
02:07:00,990 --> 02:07:01,200
right?

4926
02:07:01,200 --> 02:07:01,741
Because it was,

4927
02:07:01,741 --> 02:07:02,670
it was the opposite.

4928
02:07:02,700 --> 02:07:04,680
If it was a black people had it,

4929
02:07:04,681 --> 02:07:06,540
it would be a really
controversial subject,

4930
02:07:06,570 --> 02:07:06,810
you know?

4931
02:07:06,810 --> 02:07:07,920
But instead it's dumb.

4932
02:07:07,921 --> 02:07:08,754
White people like me,

4933
02:07:09,090 --> 02:07:13,230
I have 57% more in the end are
tall DNA than the average person.

4934
02:07:14,010 --> 02:07:14,371
You know what?

4935
02:07:14,371 --> 02:07:16,280
I'm not gonna argue that neither.

4936
02:07:16,350 --> 02:07:16,681
I was like,

4937
02:07:16,681 --> 02:07:16,991
I knew,

4938
02:07:16,991 --> 02:07:18,240
I knew something was off.

4939
02:07:18,241 --> 02:07:20,040
Pretty sure my Indiana till count is low.

4940
02:07:21,180 --> 02:07:22,020
You'd be surprised.

4941
02:07:22,420 --> 02:07:23,270
The clubby carrier,

4942
02:07:24,180 --> 02:07:25,013
I got rid of that problem.

4943
02:07:25,260 --> 02:07:26,580
But that's a European thing.

4944
02:07:26,610 --> 02:07:27,780
A lot of Europeans,

4945
02:07:27,781 --> 02:07:28,200
you know,

4946
02:07:28,200 --> 02:07:29,610
in a breadwinner and he
has to tell us by the way,

4947
02:07:29,611 --> 02:07:31,960
that a way longer run than we have a,

4948
02:07:32,070 --> 02:07:32,251
well,

4949
02:07:32,251 --> 02:07:33,150
they call it Nice Europe.

4950
02:07:33,160 --> 02:07:33,410
Wait,

4951
02:07:33,410 --> 02:07:33,570
yeah,

4952
02:07:33,570 --> 02:07:37,000
wait before they were around for
hundred thousand years on change.

4953
02:07:37,001 --> 02:07:42,001
I mean homosapiens have only been around
all 300,000 shares and our ego says,

4954
02:07:42,640 --> 02:07:42,821
oh,

4955
02:07:42,821 --> 02:07:44,230
he usurped and we,

4956
02:07:44,370 --> 02:07:44,680
we,

4957
02:07:44,680 --> 02:07:46,180
we drove them into extinction.

4958
02:07:46,690 --> 02:07:47,291
And in fact,

4959
02:07:47,291 --> 02:07:47,411
no,

4960
02:07:47,411 --> 02:07:49,340
we just made them into extinction.

4961
02:07:52,590 --> 02:07:53,470
Just dilute it up.

4962
02:07:54,260 --> 02:07:54,580
Yeah.

4963
02:07:54,580 --> 02:07:55,331
We were ruined.

4964
02:07:55,331 --> 02:07:55,960
Their purity.

4965
02:07:55,960 --> 02:07:56,120
Right.

4966
02:07:56,120 --> 02:07:57,550
We probably drugged them a neutered them.

4967
02:07:57,820 --> 02:07:58,300
Yeah.

4968
02:07:58,300 --> 02:07:59,980
Probably once we figured
out how to do that.

4969
02:08:00,090 --> 02:08:00,430
Ah,

4970
02:08:00,430 --> 02:08:01,210
which is early.

4971
02:08:01,210 --> 02:08:02,320
Do you know about that?

4972
02:08:02,350 --> 02:08:04,450
A hobbit person thing that they found?

4973
02:08:04,451 --> 02:08:05,570
The island of Flores.

4974
02:08:05,800 --> 02:08:10,190
That's another one that they didn't
know until that it's free fee.

4975
02:08:10,850 --> 02:08:13,390
[inaudible] I think just the name of it.

4976
02:08:13,391 --> 02:08:15,580
It's a tiny little person like thing.

4977
02:08:15,880 --> 02:08:19,360
There was like three feet
tall and had large feet.

4978
02:08:19,460 --> 02:08:20,440
What are you guys looking at?

4979
02:08:20,441 --> 02:08:22,090
Me Not Bro.

4980
02:08:22,240 --> 02:08:22,451
No,

4981
02:08:22,451 --> 02:08:24,100
I'm just saying we all
have our own genetic,

4982
02:08:24,440 --> 02:08:25,120
his style.

4983
02:08:25,120 --> 02:08:30,120
That was a real thing that recently
an image and that that existed.

4984
02:08:32,350 --> 02:08:32,591
Yeah.

4985
02:08:32,591 --> 02:08:35,980
Homo florensiensis that's it.

4986
02:08:36,310 --> 02:08:36,910
Um,

4987
02:08:36,910 --> 02:08:40,300
and they existed as recently
as 14,000 years ago.

4988
02:08:40,500 --> 02:08:40,870
Found.

4989
02:08:40,870 --> 02:08:41,460
Yeah.

4990
02:08:41,460 --> 02:08:41,920
Yeah.

4991
02:08:41,920 --> 02:08:42,670
They coexist.

4992
02:08:42,670 --> 02:08:44,170
They coexisted with modern humans.

4993
02:08:44,580 --> 02:08:47,860
You and they think modern humans might
have wiped them out because they were

4994
02:08:47,861 --> 02:08:48,694
probably,

4995
02:08:49,180 --> 02:08:51,430
they think there's some
cannibal at not cannibalism,

4996
02:08:51,431 --> 02:08:53,500
but they preyed upon our
children and stuff like that.

4997
02:08:53,501 --> 02:08:54,334
They hate us.

4998
02:08:54,670 --> 02:08:55,503
They hate us.

4999
02:08:56,380 --> 02:08:57,480
They were eating us well.

5000
02:08:57,700 --> 02:08:58,590
There was one of those,

5001
02:08:58,630 --> 02:08:59,590
one of the things that I've read,

5002
02:08:59,591 --> 02:09:01,660
the speculation was
that they might have a,

5003
02:09:01,750 --> 02:09:05,560
there might've been an issue with
them like invading and trying to see,

5004
02:09:05,561 --> 02:09:05,741
you know,

5005
02:09:05,741 --> 02:09:08,500
like chimps have stolen
babies and eating them.

5006
02:09:08,890 --> 02:09:09,610
You know,

5007
02:09:09,610 --> 02:09:11,230
it's a really common thing.

5008
02:09:11,231 --> 02:09:11,830
Actually.

5009
02:09:11,830 --> 02:09:13,120
Babies are delicious.

5010
02:09:14,440 --> 02:09:15,640
Well that's why people like lamb,

5011
02:09:15,641 --> 02:09:16,474
unfortunately.

5012
02:09:18,490 --> 02:09:18,940
Yeah,

5013
02:09:18,940 --> 02:09:19,780
well exactly.

5014
02:09:20,200 --> 02:09:20,651
Well that was,

5015
02:09:20,651 --> 02:09:25,510
I heard it was a company that that
produced a Vegan version of human flesh.

5016
02:09:26,130 --> 02:09:30,490
I just trying to sell to people in
Papua New Guinea that's disgusting.

5017
02:09:31,330 --> 02:09:32,710
No longer allowed to eat human flesh.

5018
02:09:32,711 --> 02:09:33,640
That's hilarious.

5019
02:09:34,330 --> 02:09:38,650
I read this thing about people in New
Guinea that were cannibals and they were

5020
02:09:38,651 --> 02:09:42,340
talking to them after World War II and
they were trying to figure out how the

5021
02:09:42,341 --> 02:09:43,300
Europeans,

5022
02:09:43,540 --> 02:09:47,380
once they found out how many people
were killed during World War II,

5023
02:09:47,620 --> 02:09:50,650
they were trying to figure out how the
Europeans man to eat that much meat.

5024
02:09:51,430 --> 02:09:51,761
Yeah.

5025
02:09:51,761 --> 02:09:52,690
And then they told them no,

5026
02:09:52,691 --> 02:09:54,100
they don't eat the people they killed.

5027
02:09:54,101 --> 02:09:55,150
And they were horrified.

5028
02:09:55,540 --> 02:09:56,860
They were like in waste,

5029
02:09:56,890 --> 02:09:58,210
you waste all that.

5030
02:09:58,211 --> 02:09:59,830
All the people that kill in battle.

5031
02:10:00,150 --> 02:10:00,630
Yeah,

5032
02:10:00,630 --> 02:10:01,420
yeah,

5033
02:10:01,420 --> 02:10:01,960
yeah.

5034
02:10:01,960 --> 02:10:02,200
That,

5035
02:10:02,200 --> 02:10:02,381
yeah,

5036
02:10:02,381 --> 02:10:02,980
it would be hard.

5037
02:10:02,980 --> 02:10:03,131
Yeah.

5038
02:10:03,131 --> 02:10:03,710
Well that's it.

5039
02:10:03,710 --> 02:10:04,400
That's a waste.

5040
02:10:04,400 --> 02:10:08,110
When it was a way to look at it and then
they believe they absorbed the noble

5041
02:10:08,111 --> 02:10:09,310
qualities of their enemy,

5042
02:10:09,820 --> 02:10:12,400
only the good spots by
eating certain spots.

5043
02:10:12,401 --> 02:10:12,820
You donate.

5044
02:10:12,820 --> 02:10:12,950
Yeah.

5045
02:10:12,950 --> 02:10:13,470
Have some if,

5046
02:10:13,470 --> 02:10:13,810
if,

5047
02:10:13,810 --> 02:10:14,261
if you're,

5048
02:10:14,261 --> 02:10:14,970
if you killed someone,

5049
02:10:14,970 --> 02:10:16,450
a battle who you thought was truly,

5050
02:10:16,451 --> 02:10:17,230
uh,

5051
02:10:17,230 --> 02:10:18,250
a great warrior,

5052
02:10:18,280 --> 02:10:20,410
that's what brings you back
to the whole Ufo thing.

5053
02:10:20,411 --> 02:10:21,720
That makes it so compelling to me.

5054
02:10:21,730 --> 02:10:26,730
So we have really serious protocols
for dealing with uncontacted tribes.

5055
02:10:26,950 --> 02:10:29,380
We don't engage with uncontacted tribes.

5056
02:10:29,381 --> 02:10:29,920
And we find,

5057
02:10:29,920 --> 02:10:31,660
I mean we almost universally at green,

5058
02:10:32,360 --> 02:10:34,070
I mean when the loggers do

5059
02:10:34,070 --> 02:10:36,470
in the Amazon assholes and mean people,

5060
02:10:36,471 --> 02:10:36,841
but the,

5061
02:10:36,841 --> 02:10:37,061
the,

5062
02:10:37,061 --> 02:10:39,050
the idea in the scientific communities,

5063
02:10:39,051 --> 02:10:40,430
we should leave these people alone.

5064
02:10:40,760 --> 02:10:42,770
And so when they find
these uncontacted tribes,

5065
02:10:42,771 --> 02:10:44,210
whether it's North Sentinel Island,

5066
02:10:44,211 --> 02:10:46,880
where that missionary was
killed recently or the Amazon,

5067
02:10:46,881 --> 02:10:50,090
when they're going through these
jungles and finding these small bands of

5068
02:10:50,091 --> 02:10:50,924
people,

5069
02:10:50,990 --> 02:10:52,700
they overwhelmingly,

5070
02:10:52,701 --> 02:10:56,900
everybody wants to back off and leave
him alone and they are so close to us.

5071
02:10:56,930 --> 02:10:58,040
I mean they are human beings.

5072
02:10:58,041 --> 02:10:59,150
They are Homo Sapiens,

5073
02:10:59,151 --> 02:10:59,841
they have tools,

5074
02:10:59,841 --> 02:11:01,190
they have civilization,

5075
02:11:01,191 --> 02:11:01,881
they have law,

5076
02:11:01,881 --> 02:11:04,640
they have all these different things
that live in these communities.

5077
02:11:04,790 --> 02:11:05,570
They're us.

5078
02:11:05,570 --> 02:11:06,020
Yeah.

5079
02:11:06,020 --> 02:11:06,860
And we back off,

5080
02:11:07,070 --> 02:11:08,660
imagine what aliens.

5081
02:11:08,690 --> 02:11:10,310
Imagine what aliens would do.

5082
02:11:10,380 --> 02:11:11,240
I'm interested in an engine.

5083
02:11:11,241 --> 02:11:11,420
Yeah,

5084
02:11:11,420 --> 02:11:12,020
that's true.

5085
02:11:12,020 --> 02:11:13,050
That's their consciousness,

5086
02:11:13,090 --> 02:11:13,430
Jamie.

5087
02:11:13,430 --> 02:11:16,670
Cause they don't want it screws
up the human flesh alternative.

5088
02:11:16,730 --> 02:11:18,770
That healthy human flesh alternative.

5089
02:11:18,830 --> 02:11:19,663
That's it.

5090
02:11:20,150 --> 02:11:20,983
Yeah.

5091
02:11:21,910 --> 02:11:26,910
It's a hoax from like all fortunate one
who from Burger I'd be tobacco food,

5092
02:11:28,790 --> 02:11:29,630
Burger Fried.

5093
02:11:29,630 --> 02:11:29,781
Who?

5094
02:11:29,781 --> 02:11:30,614
Food Burger.

5095
02:11:31,850 --> 02:11:34,010
Once you see Tofu processed,

5096
02:11:34,011 --> 02:11:34,400
you let it go.

5097
02:11:34,400 --> 02:11:35,233
Oh this is,

5098
02:11:35,760 --> 02:11:36,150
this is,

5099
02:11:36,150 --> 02:11:37,730
is this really good for you?

5100
02:11:37,731 --> 02:11:38,210
Like what?

5101
02:11:38,210 --> 02:11:40,670
This is so processed man.

5102
02:11:40,730 --> 02:11:42,530
So fucking slots,

5103
02:11:42,531 --> 02:11:45,710
like reduced to nothing
that's and then formed again.

5104
02:11:45,740 --> 02:11:47,260
Can I just eat soybeans?

5105
02:11:47,360 --> 02:11:48,860
Like what the fuck is this?

5106
02:11:48,980 --> 02:11:52,370
What you can do is you
can buy a bag of frozen.

5107
02:11:52,640 --> 02:11:53,510
That's the way to go.

5108
02:11:54,080 --> 02:11:58,100
Don't fucking Tofu rose
tasting toothpaste tube.

5109
02:11:58,160 --> 02:11:59,480
Well it tastes like nothing.

5110
02:11:59,481 --> 02:11:59,840
Yeah,

5111
02:11:59,840 --> 02:12:01,460
it's like it's weird.

5112
02:12:01,750 --> 02:12:03,020
So weird choice.

5113
02:12:03,200 --> 02:12:03,421
Yeah.

5114
02:12:03,421 --> 02:12:03,741
I can't,

5115
02:12:03,741 --> 02:12:04,220
I can't,

5116
02:12:04,220 --> 02:12:04,371
yeah,

5117
02:12:04,371 --> 02:12:05,870
I can't stand anything made from Tofu.

5118
02:12:05,930 --> 02:12:08,660
But I think that if
aliens did see us there,

5119
02:12:08,690 --> 02:12:12,410
they would probably take a hands off
approach if we weren't totally ruining

5120
02:12:12,411 --> 02:12:13,244
everything.

5121
02:12:13,280 --> 02:12:15,570
Like if we didn't have
some anti matter weapons,

5122
02:12:16,970 --> 02:12:20,780
some black hole weapon that we're just
going to just fucking nuke on New Mexico

5123
02:12:20,781 --> 02:12:22,580
just to see how it works happen.

5124
02:12:22,920 --> 02:12:24,800
And if they saw,

5125
02:12:25,250 --> 02:12:28,070
if they saw that it was going to burn
a hole through the planet and kill

5126
02:12:28,071 --> 02:12:28,790
everything on,

5127
02:12:28,790 --> 02:12:33,790
they might step in for a second before
they launched cern glider and open up a

5128
02:12:36,860 --> 02:12:41,360
black hole that it will create a particle
that would devour the fabric of the

5129
02:12:41,361 --> 02:12:41,921
university.

5130
02:12:41,921 --> 02:12:42,060
Yeah.

5131
02:12:42,060 --> 02:12:47,060
It was a black hole that would expand
and expand and expand and db did what we

5132
02:12:47,450 --> 02:12:47,930
did.

5133
02:12:47,930 --> 02:12:48,260
God,

5134
02:12:48,260 --> 02:12:48,620
man,

5135
02:12:48,620 --> 02:12:49,640
maybe we restarted.

5136
02:12:49,720 --> 02:12:50,180
Yeah.

5137
02:12:50,180 --> 02:12:50,440
Yeah.

5138
02:12:50,440 --> 02:12:51,950
Maybe we were in a parallel universe.

5139
02:12:53,720 --> 02:12:56,810
Maybe we were knocked off our
timeline into another place.

5140
02:12:57,050 --> 02:12:58,220
It makes less sense.

5141
02:12:58,340 --> 02:12:58,551
Yeah,

5142
02:12:58,551 --> 02:12:58,821
it was.

5143
02:12:58,821 --> 02:13:00,890
It was the thing that was going
around in the unit a little while.

5144
02:13:01,270 --> 02:13:04,490
The evidence of multiple universities
that we pop in and out of different

5145
02:13:04,491 --> 02:13:04,990
capacities.

5146
02:13:04,990 --> 02:13:05,570
Right.

5147
02:13:05,570 --> 02:13:06,650
Like the fact that we,

5148
02:13:06,680 --> 02:13:07,430
it's a multiverse,

5149
02:13:07,430 --> 02:13:08,570
the Ford logo,

5150
02:13:08,870 --> 02:13:09,171
let's say.

5151
02:13:09,171 --> 02:13:11,930
Do you remember you recognize this
part of the Ford logo and they see,

5152
02:13:11,931 --> 02:13:13,990
most people never noticed it.

5153
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:15,770
It's a weird little squiggle in the AF.

5154
02:13:15,980 --> 02:13:16,490
Really?

5155
02:13:16,490 --> 02:13:17,323
Yeah.

5156
02:13:17,780 --> 02:13:20,210
The Fedex thing blows people's minds to,

5157
02:13:20,300 --> 02:13:21,133
what's that?

5158
02:13:21,260 --> 02:13:23,420
The Arrow one arrow.

5159
02:13:23,780 --> 02:13:24,613
Exactly.

5160
02:13:26,630 --> 02:13:27,560
Bring ups Fedex.

5161
02:13:27,650 --> 02:13:30,920
If you'll never not see the Arrow again.

5162
02:13:30,930 --> 02:13:31,470
Yeah.

5163
02:13:31,470 --> 02:13:32,640
Same thing with the Ford logo.

5164
02:13:32,850 --> 02:13:33,683
It's like there's

5165
02:13:34,940 --> 02:13:35,700
perceptions.

5166
02:13:35,700 --> 02:13:36,300
It's like,

5167
02:13:36,300 --> 02:13:36,930
hmm.

5168
02:13:36,930 --> 02:13:38,040
And sit there the whole time.

5169
02:13:38,041 --> 02:13:38,874
And I did.

5170
02:13:39,150 --> 02:13:40,580
I didn't know there was an arrow there.

5171
02:13:40,780 --> 02:13:45,120
People will insist that
the Fedex Arrow is really,

5172
02:13:45,210 --> 02:13:45,391
oh,

5173
02:13:45,391 --> 02:13:46,110
interesting.

5174
02:13:46,110 --> 02:13:46,411
Okay.

5175
02:13:46,411 --> 02:13:47,850
But that's an accidental error.

5176
02:13:47,920 --> 02:13:48,753
No,

5177
02:13:48,920 --> 02:13:50,610
you think they designed it in there?

5178
02:13:51,100 --> 02:13:51,933
Where's there?

5179
02:13:52,090 --> 02:13:53,550
They definitely designed it right there.

5180
02:13:53,551 --> 02:13:53,940
Yeah,

5181
02:13:53,940 --> 02:13:54,773
right there.

5182
02:13:55,080 --> 02:13:55,913
The white part.

5183
02:13:56,370 --> 02:13:57,480
Now not,

5184
02:13:57,700 --> 02:13:59,760
you'll never see it again
or never not see it again.

5185
02:13:59,870 --> 02:14:00,190
Know.

5186
02:14:00,190 --> 02:14:00,730
It's funny,

5187
02:14:00,730 --> 02:14:01,563
Huh?

5188
02:14:01,920 --> 02:14:03,960
But I mean that could be
like four years before it.

5189
02:14:03,961 --> 02:14:04,210
Yeah.

5190
02:14:04,210 --> 02:14:06,790
Was the four eagle little
squiggle in the f Jews.

5191
02:14:06,840 --> 02:14:07,850
Why is that a squiggle?

5192
02:14:07,860 --> 02:14:09,630
Why is it that's ridiculous?

5193
02:14:09,820 --> 02:14:11,360
It actually makes an effort like that.

5194
02:14:12,390 --> 02:14:17,320
It actually spells fjord
or forward toward fool.

5195
02:14:17,840 --> 02:14:18,690
Is that an eye?

5196
02:14:18,691 --> 02:14:19,524
What is it?

5197
02:14:19,560 --> 02:14:20,670
Why would they squeak a lot?

5198
02:14:20,680 --> 02:14:21,513
Did they do that?

5199
02:14:21,620 --> 02:14:21,740
Oh,

5200
02:14:21,740 --> 02:14:22,110
it's not,

5201
02:14:22,110 --> 02:14:24,220
they didn't use to do that in return.

5202
02:14:27,560 --> 02:14:27,950
That's right.

5203
02:14:27,950 --> 02:14:28,783
Yeah,

5204
02:14:29,350 --> 02:14:29,670
that's right.

5205
02:14:29,670 --> 02:14:29,810
Yeah.

5206
02:14:29,810 --> 02:14:33,810
The people who insist
that it died in jail.

5207
02:14:33,811 --> 02:14:34,644
In jail.

5208
02:14:34,710 --> 02:14:36,870
So was there always a squiggle?

5209
02:14:36,871 --> 02:14:37,470
When did,

5210
02:14:37,470 --> 02:14:38,191
what is that?

5211
02:14:38,191 --> 02:14:39,690
Is that a real forward,

5212
02:14:39,720 --> 02:14:40,553
that little thing?

5213
02:14:41,340 --> 02:14:42,780
When did they make the squiggle?

5214
02:14:43,230 --> 02:14:43,830
Okay.

5215
02:14:43,830 --> 02:14:46,950
That's normal because that's what I
thought the Ford thing looked like until I

5216
02:14:46,951 --> 02:14:49,440
saw this maybe in a future
that they stopped the squiggle.

5217
02:14:49,441 --> 02:14:51,690
At some point they must
have more the opposite.

5218
02:14:51,720 --> 02:14:52,920
Maybe they add the squiggle,

5219
02:14:53,280 --> 02:14:54,960
bring up the squiggle without some on.

5220
02:14:54,961 --> 02:14:56,280
Or did you do the research?

5221
02:14:56,330 --> 02:15:01,330
What's a modern forward
go to a 2019 Ford Mustang.

5222
02:15:02,370 --> 02:15:03,240
Let's see that.

5223
02:15:04,110 --> 02:15:05,430
Let's see if they'd have the squiggles.

5224
02:15:05,431 --> 02:15:05,881
A squiggle.

5225
02:15:05,881 --> 02:15:07,290
Now it does.

5226
02:15:07,360 --> 02:15:11,550
I think maybe some the squiggle asshole
wanted to justify his existence by

5227
02:15:11,551 --> 02:15:13,640
ruining their beautiful logo.

5228
02:15:13,880 --> 02:15:14,713
Yeah.

5229
02:15:14,910 --> 02:15:15,743
Um,

5230
02:15:15,820 --> 02:15:16,320
well good.

5231
02:15:16,320 --> 02:15:16,711
Let's see.

5232
02:15:16,711 --> 02:15:19,650
I mean the logos do chain that
does the squiggle squiggle.

5233
02:15:20,080 --> 02:15:20,730
Yeah.

5234
02:15:20,730 --> 02:15:21,750
That's a new Mustang.

5235
02:15:21,751 --> 02:15:22,980
So the squiggle is a current,

5236
02:15:23,790 --> 02:15:24,420
Yup.

5237
02:15:24,420 --> 02:15:24,780
Yup.

5238
02:15:24,780 --> 02:15:25,650
The squiggles current.

5239
02:15:25,680 --> 02:15:27,030
It really doesn't fit.

5240
02:15:27,330 --> 02:15:27,510
No,

5241
02:15:27,510 --> 02:15:28,343
it looks stupid.

5242
02:15:28,850 --> 02:15:30,260
It would look better
without that stupid scores.

5243
02:15:30,670 --> 02:15:31,471
The only thing that's saving,

5244
02:15:31,471 --> 02:15:31,771
that's it.

5245
02:15:31,771 --> 02:15:32,101
Squiggles it.

5246
02:15:32,101 --> 02:15:33,480
No one noticed it up until now.

5247
02:15:33,850 --> 02:15:35,070
Now I'm never an academic notice.

5248
02:15:35,080 --> 02:15:36,540
The Mandela effect,

5249
02:15:37,200 --> 02:15:38,310
I hate Mandela effect,

5250
02:15:38,550 --> 02:15:41,850
but that just seems like
people fucking with something.

5251
02:15:41,851 --> 02:15:42,684
That's not broken.

5252
02:15:43,140 --> 02:15:43,800
Yeah,

5253
02:15:43,800 --> 02:15:44,370
right.

5254
02:15:44,370 --> 02:15:44,940
Yeah.

5255
02:15:44,940 --> 02:15:46,040
Um,

5256
02:15:46,110 --> 02:15:46,351
it's like,

5257
02:15:46,351 --> 02:15:47,850
let's just remember when they showed up,

5258
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:48,241
reg.

5259
02:15:48,241 --> 02:15:49,740
Remember when they came
up with a new coke?

5260
02:15:50,130 --> 02:15:54,540
Fuck God was up like a riot riot on their
head and sort of a parallel universe.

5261
02:15:54,560 --> 02:15:55,860
It's just a stupid idea.

5262
02:15:56,280 --> 02:15:57,330
He just ruined coke.

5263
02:15:58,200 --> 02:15:59,490
Coke's made with real cocaine.

5264
02:15:59,910 --> 02:16:00,743
The original coke.

5265
02:16:00,750 --> 02:16:01,021
Yeah.

5266
02:16:01,021 --> 02:16:01,201
No,

5267
02:16:01,201 --> 02:16:01,680
today.

5268
02:16:01,680 --> 02:16:02,131
Today.

5269
02:16:02,131 --> 02:16:02,551
Yes.

5270
02:16:02,551 --> 02:16:03,384
I thought they,

5271
02:16:03,520 --> 02:16:04,500
they replaced it with caffeine.

5272
02:16:04,530 --> 02:16:04,710
No,

5273
02:16:04,710 --> 02:16:05,760
they use cocoa leaves.

5274
02:16:05,810 --> 02:16:06,481
Smacking the thesis.

5275
02:16:06,481 --> 02:16:07,650
Coca leaves for flavor.

5276
02:16:07,651 --> 02:16:08,101
Yes.

5277
02:16:08,101 --> 02:16:08,731
In fact,

5278
02:16:08,731 --> 02:16:09,564
the company,

5279
02:16:09,630 --> 02:16:09,961
dude,

5280
02:16:09,961 --> 02:16:10,890
it's crazy.

5281
02:16:11,160 --> 02:16:13,740
The company that makes the coke,

5282
02:16:14,360 --> 02:16:17,850
the company that uses the coca leaves
that brings in the coca leaves to make

5283
02:16:17,851 --> 02:16:22,320
Coca Cola is the number one
creator of medical grade cocaine.

5284
02:16:22,800 --> 02:16:26,850
They use that coca leave to
also make medical grade cocaine.

5285
02:16:26,851 --> 02:16:29,160
There's no cocaine in Coca Cola,

5286
02:16:29,170 --> 02:16:30,250
but there is a flavor

5287
02:16:30,760 --> 02:16:32,680
that's a bunch of different four logos.

5288
02:16:32,910 --> 02:16:33,190
Yeah.

5289
02:16:33,190 --> 02:16:33,860
Over the years.

5290
02:16:33,860 --> 02:16:34,030
See,

5291
02:16:34,030 --> 02:16:34,800
I just drink.

5292
02:16:34,800 --> 02:16:35,620
I drink diet coke.

5293
02:16:35,620 --> 02:16:39,670
Would you 1927 to 2003.

5294
02:16:39,770 --> 02:16:40,220
Wow.

5295
02:16:40,220 --> 02:16:40,770
All of them,

5296
02:16:40,770 --> 02:16:41,603
Huh?

5297
02:16:41,830 --> 02:16:42,160
Huh?

5298
02:16:42,160 --> 02:16:43,510
I like the one in 1903.

5299
02:16:43,511 --> 02:16:44,500
That's actually a pretty dope.

5300
02:16:46,230 --> 02:16:46,870
Um,

5301
02:16:46,870 --> 02:16:48,730
Google coke.

5302
02:16:48,760 --> 02:16:51,940
They use coca leaves to make Coca Cola.

5303
02:16:51,970 --> 02:16:53,040
They still do it.

5304
02:16:53,041 --> 02:16:53,711
Actually do.

5305
02:16:53,711 --> 02:16:58,030
And then the company does that
because it makes cocaine because the,

5306
02:16:58,230 --> 02:17:00,530
yeah cause the recipe for herbal.

5307
02:17:00,670 --> 02:17:02,410
There's like a lot of
herbs that go into coke.

5308
02:17:02,440 --> 02:17:04,390
Yes it's a flavor.

5309
02:17:04,750 --> 02:17:06,760
But the Diet coke is just chemicals.

5310
02:17:07,300 --> 02:17:08,111
It's all artificial.

5311
02:17:08,111 --> 02:17:10,670
I remember I was in school when the new
coke thing happened and then he'll get

5312
02:17:10,680 --> 02:17:14,880
this advertising besides producing
the cocoa flavor agent for Coca Cola.

5313
02:17:14,881 --> 02:17:18,460
The Stephan company extracts cocaine
from the coca leaves which sells it to

5314
02:17:18,890 --> 02:17:20,310
Mallon crock.

5315
02:17:20,800 --> 02:17:24,040
A Saint Louis Missouri pharmaceutical
manufacturer that is the only company in

5316
02:17:24,041 --> 02:17:27,490
the United States licensed to
purify cocaine from medical use.

5317
02:17:27,870 --> 02:17:28,780
But I'll use,

5318
02:17:29,980 --> 02:17:30,460
yeah,

5319
02:17:30,460 --> 02:17:31,060
there you go.

5320
02:17:31,060 --> 02:17:33,490
So they're actually
using actual coca leaves.

5321
02:17:33,491 --> 02:17:34,324
So someone,

5322
02:17:34,420 --> 02:17:37,000
I guarantee you if you
follow the paperwork,

5323
02:17:37,001 --> 02:17:38,920
there's a bunch of cocaine
hanging around guys,

5324
02:17:38,921 --> 02:17:39,490
additives,

5325
02:17:39,490 --> 02:17:40,300
residual.

5326
02:17:40,300 --> 02:17:40,901
Those guys,

5327
02:17:40,901 --> 02:17:41,830
they get a little bit here,

5328
02:17:43,500 --> 02:17:44,500
gives you a little pep me up.

5329
02:17:44,540 --> 02:17:45,100
Right.

5330
02:17:45,100 --> 02:17:47,770
That's what's amazing is that you're
not allowed to chew the leaves cause

5331
02:17:47,771 --> 02:17:49,690
apparently chewing the
leaves is really healthy.

5332
02:17:50,170 --> 02:17:51,340
You get flavonoids,

5333
02:17:51,341 --> 02:17:52,870
it's actually good for you.

5334
02:17:52,871 --> 02:17:55,990
And it gives you a pickup
that's very similar to caffeine.

5335
02:17:56,080 --> 02:17:56,560
Yeah.

5336
02:17:56,560 --> 02:18:00,070
I mean that's why people living in
those forests been chewing them.

5337
02:18:04,150 --> 02:18:04,780
What's this chain?

5338
02:18:04,780 --> 02:18:08,740
I just one of those weird things that
pops up when you see a 90% of their sales

5339
02:18:08,741 --> 02:18:08,981
are done,

5340
02:18:08,981 --> 02:18:09,611
the United States,

5341
02:18:09,611 --> 02:18:11,530
but it's an Irish tax
registered manufacturer.

5342
02:18:11,560 --> 02:18:13,460
Uh,

5343
02:18:13,890 --> 02:18:15,340
Irish economic explosion.

5344
02:18:16,480 --> 02:18:17,920
Weasel moves,

5345
02:18:17,950 --> 02:18:18,371
one of them.

5346
02:18:18,371 --> 02:18:20,110
Tax Weasel moves.

5347
02:18:20,590 --> 02:18:21,423
Yeah.

5348
02:18:21,850 --> 02:18:22,900
Taxes.

5349
02:18:23,490 --> 02:18:28,120
That's it bizarre when you find out this
giant corporations that make billions

5350
02:18:28,120 --> 02:18:28,121
of dollars,

5351
02:18:28,121 --> 02:18:30,790
if they're all in Ireland
and the weasel out of taxes,

5352
02:18:31,530 --> 02:18:32,363
you know?

5353
02:18:32,420 --> 02:18:32,560
Yeah.

5354
02:18:32,560 --> 02:18:34,870
How much did I say they
don't believe in socialism?

5355
02:18:34,930 --> 02:18:37,030
Did you read that at many
taxes I paid last year.

5356
02:18:37,031 --> 02:18:38,550
Amazon zero.

5357
02:18:38,670 --> 02:18:39,490
Zero.

5358
02:18:39,490 --> 02:18:40,180
Well,

5359
02:18:40,180 --> 02:18:41,013
you know,

5360
02:18:41,200 --> 02:18:43,630
it's nice that it exists and you know,

5361
02:18:43,631 --> 02:18:46,050
you get a one click and you
have some toilet paper said Tom,

5362
02:18:46,590 --> 02:18:48,190
I'm happy to use their product.

5363
02:18:48,250 --> 02:18:49,450
And that's why they need,

5364
02:18:49,480 --> 02:18:53,830
that's why they needed $1 billion in
tax breaks from the city of New York.

5365
02:18:53,890 --> 02:18:55,020
How does that work?

5366
02:18:55,240 --> 02:18:56,100
How does that work?

5367
02:18:56,400 --> 02:18:57,850
You could pay zero in taxes.

5368
02:18:57,851 --> 02:18:58,510
Zero.

5369
02:18:58,510 --> 02:18:59,140
Yeah.

5370
02:18:59,140 --> 02:19:01,060
And why did they need those
tax breaks in Long Island?

5371
02:19:01,090 --> 02:19:04,450
Maybe that's why I feel
like you fucking dummies.

5372
02:19:04,451 --> 02:19:06,910
You let Amazon fuck you over like that.

5373
02:19:07,240 --> 02:19:09,100
Or maybe that's why they're coming here.

5374
02:19:09,101 --> 02:19:10,170
All their money's in Ireland.

5375
02:19:11,610 --> 02:19:12,730
Ireland's doing great.

5376
02:19:12,790 --> 02:19:13,360
Yeah.

5377
02:19:13,360 --> 02:19:15,580
Islands kicking ass cocaine shit.

5378
02:19:15,581 --> 02:19:16,400
And I'm going to Ireland.

5379
02:19:16,400 --> 02:19:17,310
Yeah.

5380
02:19:18,400 --> 02:19:19,630
Aliens got a bank somewhere.

5381
02:19:19,631 --> 02:19:20,800
I'm going to curl.

5382
02:19:21,160 --> 02:19:23,000
And there's leaves occurrence.

5383
02:19:23,080 --> 02:19:27,800
There's some sort of a ballot initiative
where they're trying to put a silicide

5384
02:19:27,801 --> 02:19:28,570
been,

5385
02:19:28,570 --> 02:19:28,821
uh,

5386
02:19:28,821 --> 02:19:33,260
in the same medicinal category
as they're using marijuana.

5387
02:19:33,261 --> 02:19:37,340
Marijuana will be able to get
an in store in California.

5388
02:19:37,341 --> 02:19:38,180
They're trying to do that.

5389
02:19:38,181 --> 02:19:43,181
And past medical medical silicide
been for therapy while here.

5390
02:19:43,730 --> 02:19:48,650
I had been on antidepressants since news
radio days and I'm just actually just

5391
02:19:48,651 --> 02:19:50,060
went off it this month,

5392
02:19:50,240 --> 02:19:50,821
this month.

5393
02:19:50,821 --> 02:19:51,530
How are you feeling?

5394
02:19:51,530 --> 02:19:52,070
Good,

5395
02:19:52,070 --> 02:19:52,341
look.

5396
02:19:52,341 --> 02:19:52,730
Great.

5397
02:19:52,730 --> 02:19:53,001
Good.

5398
02:19:53,001 --> 02:19:53,271
Yeah,

5399
02:19:53,271 --> 02:19:54,150
I feel very good.

5400
02:19:54,740 --> 02:19:56,930
Part of it was because I had
this head injury a few years ago.

5401
02:19:56,960 --> 02:19:57,470
What happened?

5402
02:19:57,470 --> 02:19:58,040
I had a,

5403
02:19:58,040 --> 02:19:58,191
well,

5404
02:19:58,191 --> 02:19:58,491
I,

5405
02:19:58,491 --> 02:19:58,880
I,

5406
02:19:58,880 --> 02:19:59,360
uh,

5407
02:19:59,360 --> 02:20:00,200
I don't know if you remember this.

5408
02:20:00,201 --> 02:20:01,280
I used to drink quite a bit.

5409
02:20:01,430 --> 02:20:02,031
I do remember.

5410
02:20:02,031 --> 02:20:02,780
Do you remember that?

5411
02:20:02,780 --> 02:20:03,411
Now I,

5412
02:20:03,411 --> 02:20:04,190
uh,

5413
02:20:04,190 --> 02:20:05,480
now I do one night,

5414
02:20:05,481 --> 02:20:06,590
about four years ago,

5415
02:20:06,860 --> 02:20:07,311
uh,

5416
02:20:07,311 --> 02:20:10,430
I went and got really drunk
or right before Christmas and,

5417
02:20:10,830 --> 02:20:11,420
uh,

5418
02:20:11,420 --> 02:20:11,810
wound up,

5419
02:20:11,810 --> 02:20:14,270
I guess at a bar called the must downtown,

5420
02:20:14,271 --> 02:20:15,500
right around the corner from my apartment.

5421
02:20:16,760 --> 02:20:18,470
And I fell down on the patio,

5422
02:20:18,620 --> 02:20:20,090
just fell over like that.

5423
02:20:20,540 --> 02:20:21,373
I would call it our,

5424
02:20:21,380 --> 02:20:26,380
I would call it a dead fall backwards
and landed back God and hit my head on

5425
02:20:26,991 --> 02:20:27,350
the,

5426
02:20:27,350 --> 02:20:32,350
on the stone patio with enough force that
my brain gave me a black eye from the

5427
02:20:32,511 --> 02:20:33,860
inside of my head.

5428
02:20:33,980 --> 02:20:35,150
It's called cerebral hemorrhage,

5429
02:20:35,151 --> 02:20:35,781
chipping away at night.

5430
02:20:35,781 --> 02:20:37,100
I had a subdural Hematoma.

5431
02:20:37,490 --> 02:20:39,500
I was in the ICU for four days.

5432
02:20:39,700 --> 02:20:40,521
Get this bread.

5433
02:20:40,521 --> 02:20:42,040
I had one of those black right.

5434
02:20:42,100 --> 02:20:43,020
Red Blood eyes.

5435
02:20:44,280 --> 02:20:44,570
Yeah,

5436
02:20:44,570 --> 02:20:46,110
I do somewhere I think one Instagram.

5437
02:20:46,760 --> 02:20:47,001
No,

5438
02:20:47,001 --> 02:20:48,800
I guess my of this that's happened.

5439
02:20:48,801 --> 02:20:48,951
Oh,

5440
02:20:48,951 --> 02:20:49,784
Jesus.

5441
02:20:50,640 --> 02:20:50,901
Sorry.

5442
02:20:50,901 --> 02:20:51,171
Thank you.

5443
02:20:51,171 --> 02:20:51,430
They can,

5444
02:20:51,430 --> 02:20:53,840
they can get it to sound
like Emory though this out.

5445
02:20:54,220 --> 02:20:55,790
Can you just like total recall?

5446
02:20:55,830 --> 02:20:57,170
You can just remove things,

5447
02:20:57,171 --> 02:20:59,090
but Chrissy know Chrissy
has the photos of all that.

5448
02:20:59,120 --> 02:20:59,953
Uh,

5449
02:21:00,140 --> 02:21:00,441
but,

5450
02:21:00,441 --> 02:21:01,430
but the weird thing was,

5451
02:21:01,760 --> 02:21:02,593
uh,

5452
02:21:02,720 --> 02:21:03,720
and then I decided I was all right,

5453
02:21:03,721 --> 02:21:04,070
what do I said?

5454
02:21:04,070 --> 02:21:04,221
All right.

5455
02:21:04,221 --> 02:21:05,054
I got to quit drinking.

5456
02:21:05,330 --> 02:21:06,090
And I thought,

5457
02:21:06,090 --> 02:21:06,320
you know,

5458
02:21:06,320 --> 02:21:06,921
it'd be hard,

5459
02:21:06,921 --> 02:21:07,670
but I'll do it.

5460
02:21:07,670 --> 02:21:08,530
And uh,

5461
02:21:09,010 --> 02:21:13,400
and I kept waiting for it to get
hard to not drink and it never did.

5462
02:21:13,580 --> 02:21:14,780
Like I'm not four years.

5463
02:21:14,781 --> 02:21:15,950
I haven't had a drink at four years.

5464
02:21:16,470 --> 02:21:16,950
Uh,

5465
02:21:16,950 --> 02:21:17,783
and uh,

5466
02:21:17,810 --> 02:21:18,410
heroin.

5467
02:21:18,410 --> 02:21:19,243
Yeah.

5468
02:21:19,420 --> 02:21:20,390
But don't do anything.

5469
02:21:20,420 --> 02:21:20,870
Nothing.

5470
02:21:20,870 --> 02:21:21,700
No Pot.

5471
02:21:21,700 --> 02:21:22,110
No,

5472
02:21:22,110 --> 02:21:22,340
no,

5473
02:21:22,340 --> 02:21:22,580
no.

5474
02:21:22,580 --> 02:21:23,181
I wish I could.

5475
02:21:23,181 --> 02:21:23,870
I don't like pot.

5476
02:21:23,870 --> 02:21:24,703
I wish I could enjoy it.

5477
02:21:24,800 --> 02:21:25,633
Don't you like about it?

5478
02:21:25,730 --> 02:21:27,710
And it makes me very quiet and paranoid.

5479
02:21:27,711 --> 02:21:28,544
That's my favorite part.

5480
02:21:30,290 --> 02:21:32,160
And I like about it.

5481
02:21:33,350 --> 02:21:35,050
But you seem very lucid
when you're on pot.

5482
02:21:35,180 --> 02:21:37,310
It seemed very and very communicative.

5483
02:21:37,360 --> 02:21:38,030
Yeah.

5484
02:21:38,030 --> 02:21:38,960
Whereas when I had smoked pot,

5485
02:21:38,990 --> 02:21:40,370
I can't put a sentence together.

5486
02:21:40,390 --> 02:21:40,640
Oh,

5487
02:21:40,640 --> 02:21:41,473
it must be friendly.

5488
02:21:41,640 --> 02:21:41,960
Yeah.

5489
02:21:41,960 --> 02:21:43,400
It makes me very withdrawn.

5490
02:21:43,820 --> 02:21:44,990
Alcohol makes me friendly.

5491
02:21:45,410 --> 02:21:46,480
So what that for me too.

5492
02:21:46,510 --> 02:21:46,651
Yeah.

5493
02:21:46,651 --> 02:21:49,610
We say the one thing I miss about
drinking is the liking people

5494
02:21:52,010 --> 02:21:52,870
like me more than,

5495
02:21:52,880 --> 02:21:53,713
yeah.

5496
02:21:54,890 --> 02:21:55,340
But I have,

5497
02:21:55,340 --> 02:21:56,390
because of this brain injury,

5498
02:21:56,490 --> 02:21:59,450
it never was hard to not drink.

5499
02:21:59,451 --> 02:21:59,720
I,

5500
02:21:59,720 --> 02:22:02,540
my urge to drink was gone from
getting knocked in the head.

5501
02:22:02,541 --> 02:22:02,900
Yeah.

5502
02:22:02,900 --> 02:22:03,260
Wow.

5503
02:22:03,260 --> 02:22:05,960
And also I noticed over
the couple of years is it,

5504
02:22:06,050 --> 02:22:07,460
I haven't had any depression.

5505
02:22:07,880 --> 02:22:08,390
Whoa.

5506
02:22:08,390 --> 02:22:09,051
And so,

5507
02:22:09,051 --> 02:22:09,820
uh,

5508
02:22:09,820 --> 02:22:10,330
just before,

5509
02:22:10,330 --> 02:22:11,870
I guess in like November,

5510
02:22:11,871 --> 02:22:12,230
I said,

5511
02:22:12,230 --> 02:22:13,030
I talked to my doctors,

5512
02:22:13,030 --> 02:22:15,350
I wanted to go off the
antidepressants and see what happens.

5513
02:22:16,010 --> 02:22:17,000
And uh,

5514
02:22:17,060 --> 02:22:20,390
so I've been like gradually weaned off
and just this month took like the last

5515
02:22:20,390 --> 02:22:21,650
day antidepressants for about a month ago.

5516
02:22:21,860 --> 02:22:23,870
So how long has the weaning process,

5517
02:22:23,950 --> 02:22:25,850
it's like about three months and node.

5518
02:22:26,090 --> 02:22:27,240
How do you really addictive?

5519
02:22:27,300 --> 02:22:28,133
Yes.

5520
02:22:28,320 --> 02:22:28,920
Yes.

5521
02:22:28,920 --> 02:22:30,570
And how do you do it when you're weaning?

5522
02:22:30,630 --> 02:22:33,330
It's just gradually reducing the dosage,

5523
02:22:33,360 --> 02:22:34,320
the daily dosage,

5524
02:22:34,321 --> 02:22:38,010
and then doing it every
other day and then it's gone.

5525
02:22:38,040 --> 02:22:39,090
But they have a protocol.

5526
02:22:39,120 --> 02:22:39,660
Yeah.

5527
02:22:39,660 --> 02:22:40,140
Yeah.

5528
02:22:40,140 --> 02:22:42,030
And so did he discourage,

5529
02:22:42,031 --> 02:22:43,050
you know,

5530
02:22:43,051 --> 02:22:43,651
eye doctor was,

5531
02:22:43,651 --> 02:22:44,730
he was excited about it,

5532
02:22:44,731 --> 02:22:44,891
he said,

5533
02:22:44,891 --> 02:22:44,941
oh,

5534
02:22:44,941 --> 02:22:45,480
that's great.

5535
02:22:45,480 --> 02:22:46,171
Congratulations.

5536
02:22:46,171 --> 02:22:46,381
Good,

5537
02:22:46,381 --> 02:22:46,680
good.

5538
02:22:46,680 --> 02:22:46,981
You know,

5539
02:22:46,981 --> 02:22:47,251
and said,

5540
02:22:47,251 --> 02:22:47,820
but you know,

5541
02:22:47,820 --> 02:22:50,040
keep keeping touch and
like Israel doctor too,

5542
02:22:50,041 --> 02:22:50,280
right?

5543
02:22:50,280 --> 02:22:51,113
Yeah,

5544
02:22:51,510 --> 02:22:52,343
I guess so.

5545
02:22:52,450 --> 02:22:54,510
He had to think he had
a reflector on his head.

5546
02:22:54,570 --> 02:22:55,403
That's all you need,

5547
02:22:55,490 --> 02:22:57,150
a lab coat.

5548
02:22:57,240 --> 02:22:57,900
And he was like,

5549
02:22:57,900 --> 02:22:58,290
you know,

5550
02:22:58,290 --> 02:22:59,010
and he's like,

5551
02:22:59,010 --> 02:23:00,210
I think he lives in the neighborhood.

5552
02:23:00,211 --> 02:23:01,560
He's always walking around outside.

5553
02:23:01,730 --> 02:23:02,490
That's him.

5554
02:23:02,490 --> 02:23:03,150
That's a doctor.

5555
02:23:03,150 --> 02:23:04,920
So we did it.

5556
02:23:04,921 --> 02:23:05,570
And uh,

5557
02:23:05,570 --> 02:23:06,750
and so now I'm about a month,

5558
02:23:07,370 --> 02:23:09,440
about a month in without
any antidepressants.

5559
02:23:09,750 --> 02:23:11,520
What is the difference?

5560
02:23:12,180 --> 02:23:13,350
Uh,

5561
02:23:13,800 --> 02:23:14,790
I don't really know yet.

5562
02:23:14,791 --> 02:23:15,451
I mean it's hard.

5563
02:23:15,451 --> 02:23:16,500
I don't feel different age.

5564
02:23:16,501 --> 02:23:16,980
It,

5565
02:23:16,980 --> 02:23:17,680
uh,

5566
02:23:17,680 --> 02:23:18,190
I def,

5567
02:23:18,190 --> 02:23:19,740
I definitely feel more emotional.

5568
02:23:20,990 --> 02:23:21,830
Uh,

5569
02:23:21,860 --> 02:23:22,081
you know,

5570
02:23:22,081 --> 02:23:23,670
I kept crying at the Oscars.

5571
02:23:23,760 --> 02:23:24,181
Really?

5572
02:23:24,181 --> 02:23:24,570
Why,

5573
02:23:24,570 --> 02:23:25,403
what arts?

5574
02:23:25,440 --> 02:23:26,130
All of it.

5575
02:23:26,130 --> 02:23:28,500
Why you could've had Kevin Hart host.

5576
02:23:30,740 --> 02:23:31,573
Yeah,

5577
02:23:31,950 --> 02:23:32,611
definitely more.

5578
02:23:32,611 --> 02:23:33,630
I think I'm more emotional.

5579
02:23:34,330 --> 02:23:35,160
Yeah.

5580
02:23:35,160 --> 02:23:36,390
And uh,

5581
02:23:36,460 --> 02:23:37,000
you know,

5582
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:37,833
we'll see what happens.

5583
02:23:38,340 --> 02:23:39,120
Hopefully.

5584
02:23:39,120 --> 02:23:39,900
I mean,

5585
02:23:39,900 --> 02:23:42,000
hopefully I'm part of it.

5586
02:23:42,001 --> 02:23:42,301
I was thinking,

5587
02:23:42,301 --> 02:23:44,670
I hope it will help with writing cause
I felt like I was having trouble coming

5588
02:23:44,671 --> 02:23:45,540
up with story ideas.

5589
02:23:47,100 --> 02:23:48,750
You do hug me too long now.

5590
02:23:49,950 --> 02:23:50,340
Yeah.

5591
02:23:50,340 --> 02:23:50,561
Oh,

5592
02:23:50,561 --> 02:23:51,720
I'll always become a predator.

5593
02:23:54,690 --> 02:23:55,523
That's what it is.

5594
02:23:56,160 --> 02:23:57,330
But I feel good about it.

5595
02:23:57,420 --> 02:23:58,253
The important thing.

5596
02:23:59,070 --> 02:24:03,270
So the only thing is emotions
and you feel more creative,

5597
02:24:03,271 --> 02:24:04,200
you feel more in touch.

5598
02:24:04,201 --> 02:24:04,920
You don't know yet.

5599
02:24:04,920 --> 02:24:05,341
I don't know.

5600
02:24:05,341 --> 02:24:06,270
And I don't even know if I feel,

5601
02:24:06,330 --> 02:24:06,751
I just know,

5602
02:24:06,751 --> 02:24:08,550
I definitely know that there's a,

5603
02:24:09,750 --> 02:24:11,610
there's a heightened emotionalism.

5604
02:24:12,120 --> 02:24:14,590
Has it affected your him
provides us a little while at,

5605
02:24:14,640 --> 02:24:15,473
doesn't seem to happen.

5606
02:24:15,490 --> 02:24:16,350
I was worried it would,

5607
02:24:16,351 --> 02:24:19,310
I was worried that I would be like,

5608
02:24:19,380 --> 02:24:21,990
I might not be able to go out and
do those shows cause that'd be more,

5609
02:24:22,270 --> 02:24:24,120
I was worried it might be
more moody and you know,

5610
02:24:24,860 --> 02:24:25,440
Yeah.

5611
02:24:25,440 --> 02:24:26,273
Yeah.

5612
02:24:26,520 --> 02:24:29,100
But it's so far it hasn't affected them.

5613
02:24:29,640 --> 02:24:30,473
Um,

5614
02:24:30,510 --> 02:24:33,690
cause I went on them and news radio
cause I couldn't work at one point.

5615
02:24:33,691 --> 02:24:34,201
I got to the point,

5616
02:24:34,201 --> 02:24:34,321
right.

5617
02:24:34,321 --> 02:24:35,340
It's couldn't work anymore.

5618
02:24:36,060 --> 02:24:38,760
And that's when I started going on
anti depressants and it saved me,

5619
02:24:38,910 --> 02:24:39,210
you know,

5620
02:24:39,210 --> 02:24:41,010
so totally believe that people should get,

5621
02:24:41,220 --> 02:24:42,660
get on meds and stay on them.

5622
02:24:42,810 --> 02:24:43,643
You know,

5623
02:24:43,710 --> 02:24:44,011
it's,

5624
02:24:44,011 --> 02:24:45,330
it definitely helps some people.

5625
02:24:45,331 --> 02:24:47,640
I mean it saved a couple
of my friends for sure.

5626
02:24:47,700 --> 02:24:48,060
Yeah.

5627
02:24:48,060 --> 02:24:51,740
There were suicidal and just
really didn't know where to turn.

5628
02:24:51,760 --> 02:24:54,870
They got on the right ones
and they had experiment.

5629
02:24:55,290 --> 02:24:57,030
I don't think I would've
made it through the,

5630
02:24:57,720 --> 02:24:58,080
you know,

5631
02:24:58,080 --> 02:24:58,980
the 2000.

5632
02:24:59,630 --> 02:25:00,463
Wow.

5633
02:25:00,660 --> 02:25:01,120
You know,

5634
02:25:01,120 --> 02:25:04,170
like we just lost Brody Stevens just died.

5635
02:25:04,420 --> 02:25:04,650
Yeah.

5636
02:25:04,650 --> 02:25:05,840
He got off his meds.

5637
02:25:05,870 --> 02:25:06,450
Yeah.

5638
02:25:06,450 --> 02:25:06,781
He,

5639
02:25:06,781 --> 02:25:07,200
um,

5640
02:25:07,200 --> 02:25:07,570
he,

5641
02:25:07,570 --> 02:25:10,640
he didn't like the way it felt
to be on them and you know,

5642
02:25:10,730 --> 02:25:12,390
so he's so hard.

5643
02:25:12,660 --> 02:25:16,620
That's such a hard one to take
because everyone loved that guy.

5644
02:25:16,621 --> 02:25:18,360
And to think that everyone,

5645
02:25:18,390 --> 02:25:18,571
I mean,

5646
02:25:18,571 --> 02:25:20,100
he has no haters.

5647
02:25:20,550 --> 02:25:21,001
I don't know.

5648
02:25:21,001 --> 02:25:22,290
A single person was like,

5649
02:25:22,291 --> 02:25:23,190
that guy was a dick.

5650
02:25:23,350 --> 02:25:23,790
No,

5651
02:25:23,790 --> 02:25:23,941
no,

5652
02:25:23,941 --> 02:25:24,071
no,

5653
02:25:24,071 --> 02:25:24,161
no,

5654
02:25:24,161 --> 02:25:24,450
no,

5655
02:25:24,450 --> 02:25:25,030
no one.

5656
02:25:25,030 --> 02:25:25,841
Everyone loved him.

5657
02:25:25,841 --> 02:25:28,190
And it hit everybody really hard
from close friends to people.

5658
02:25:28,220 --> 02:25:29,140
Just knew him a little bit.

5659
02:25:29,141 --> 02:25:30,370
Like I knew him just a little bit.

5660
02:25:30,440 --> 02:25:31,750
He was so sweet,

5661
02:25:31,751 --> 02:25:33,070
but he was so,

5662
02:25:33,310 --> 02:25:34,930
so tortured.

5663
02:25:34,931 --> 02:25:36,580
He was just in pain all the time.

5664
02:25:36,581 --> 02:25:37,414
And yeah,

5665
02:25:37,630 --> 02:25:38,463
it's just,

5666
02:25:38,470 --> 02:25:43,330
it's so strange that you think the
thing that people like most is for other

5667
02:25:43,331 --> 02:25:45,280
people to love them and care about them.

5668
02:25:45,281 --> 02:25:46,420
And everybody loves Brody.

5669
02:25:46,620 --> 02:25:47,080
Yeah.

5670
02:25:47,080 --> 02:25:48,430
But yet he couldn't,

5671
02:25:48,870 --> 02:25:50,200
it just couldn't go on.

5672
02:25:50,500 --> 02:25:51,160
But I never,

5673
02:25:51,160 --> 02:25:53,860
I've never known Brodie
to have a relationship.

5674
02:25:53,960 --> 02:25:56,950
I've never known him to have
a special someone in his life.

5675
02:25:56,950 --> 02:25:57,631
And I mean that,

5676
02:25:57,631 --> 02:26:00,760
that alone probably be very,

5677
02:26:00,761 --> 02:26:01,850
very depressed.

5678
02:26:02,050 --> 02:26:03,100
Well especially if,

5679
02:26:03,180 --> 02:26:05,770
if everyone loves you but you don't
feel connected to any of them.

5680
02:26:05,800 --> 02:26:06,150
Right?

5681
02:26:06,150 --> 02:26:10,660
Like how empty that rails and
that's the core of depression name.

5682
02:26:11,090 --> 02:26:11,923
Yeah.

5683
02:26:12,190 --> 02:26:15,100
But it's also the core of depression
I had having had depression.

5684
02:26:15,700 --> 02:26:19,780
One of the things that hits you is that
feeling that you just can't connect and

5685
02:26:19,781 --> 02:26:20,141
does it,

5686
02:26:20,141 --> 02:26:23,170
was yours coming about when your
first marriage was breaking up?

5687
02:26:23,500 --> 02:26:28,420
I mean I had lifelong depression but I
didn't get it treated until that point

5688
02:26:28,450 --> 02:26:29,283
when it was like,

5689
02:26:29,380 --> 02:26:29,591
you know,

5690
02:26:29,591 --> 02:26:30,424
it was like,

5691
02:26:30,550 --> 02:26:31,300
uh,

5692
02:26:31,300 --> 02:26:34,990
yeah cause of the marriage was breaking
up and I had to fly to Africa twice in a

5693
02:26:34,990 --> 02:26:36,100
month to see my kids.

5694
02:26:36,220 --> 02:26:39,730
And you remember the time that like
a protected a reporter from you?

5695
02:26:40,120 --> 02:26:41,220
I'll let the TCA,

5696
02:26:41,890 --> 02:26:42,640
yeah,

5697
02:26:42,640 --> 02:26:44,860
he was on malaria medication and drinking,

5698
02:26:45,160 --> 02:26:46,370
which apparently enough,

5699
02:26:47,440 --> 02:26:50,320
so super sweet kind Dave was,

5700
02:26:50,321 --> 02:26:54,810
was going to kick someone's ass and I
literally had to like hold on to him and

5701
02:26:54,820 --> 02:26:56,630
kind of want to see that I wasn't,

5702
02:26:56,650 --> 02:26:57,390
I hadn't because that was,

5703
02:26:57,390 --> 02:26:57,530
yeah,

5704
02:26:57,530 --> 02:26:57,820
the thing,

5705
02:26:57,820 --> 02:27:00,790
I've been flown to Africa
twice and it just got back.

5706
02:27:00,790 --> 02:27:03,490
We did the tcs and I think
I also threw a glass at,

5707
02:27:03,520 --> 02:27:05,290
uh Oh fuck.

5708
02:27:05,291 --> 02:27:06,340
I'm blanking on his Tony,

5709
02:27:06,370 --> 02:27:06,760
Tony,

5710
02:27:06,760 --> 02:27:07,330
Tony,

5711
02:27:07,330 --> 02:27:07,781
Tony,

5712
02:27:07,781 --> 02:27:08,614
uh,

5713
02:27:08,980 --> 02:27:09,813
Jesus.

5714
02:27:10,360 --> 02:27:12,670
Fuck them blankets and nice guy.

5715
02:27:12,671 --> 02:27:13,330
Sorry Dude.

5716
02:27:13,330 --> 02:27:13,900
We're handled.

5717
02:27:13,900 --> 02:27:14,500
Tony.

5718
02:27:14,500 --> 02:27:15,220
Jesus.

5719
02:27:15,220 --> 02:27:15,790
I left.

5720
02:27:15,790 --> 02:27:16,623
Tony's a great guy,

5721
02:27:16,840 --> 02:27:18,640
but I was like out of my skull and I just,

5722
02:27:18,650 --> 02:27:19,330
yeah,

5723
02:27:19,330 --> 02:27:19,601
well that was,

5724
02:27:19,601 --> 02:27:20,180
that was her partner.

5725
02:27:20,180 --> 02:27:22,240
I took his report.

5726
02:27:22,241 --> 02:27:26,470
You took his tape recorder and Duncan
and his drafts and threatened to kick his

5727
02:27:26,471 --> 02:27:27,010
ass.

5728
02:27:27,010 --> 02:27:27,640
Yeah,

5729
02:27:27,640 --> 02:27:28,270
cause I was,

5730
02:27:28,270 --> 02:27:28,541
yeah,

5731
02:27:28,541 --> 02:27:31,470
I was drunk and yeah,

5732
02:27:31,570 --> 02:27:31,990
I was like,

5733
02:27:31,990 --> 02:27:32,780
oh my God,

5734
02:27:32,780 --> 02:27:33,613
have to do something.

5735
02:27:33,620 --> 02:27:33,911
Sorry,

5736
02:27:33,911 --> 02:27:34,171
I missed,

5737
02:27:34,171 --> 02:27:34,391
I was like,

5738
02:27:34,391 --> 02:27:35,350
I have to stop this.

5739
02:27:35,440 --> 02:27:35,600
Oh,

5740
02:27:35,600 --> 02:27:36,341
this is crazy.

5741
02:27:36,341 --> 02:27:37,174
I can just,

5742
02:27:37,890 --> 02:27:38,420
yeah.

5743
02:27:38,420 --> 02:27:39,810
Well then it was after that that,

5744
02:27:39,870 --> 02:27:43,630
that I just went on antidepressants
because I crashed really hard after that.

5745
02:27:44,350 --> 02:27:45,280
And it was like one the things about that.

5746
02:27:45,310 --> 02:27:46,480
I said you could go to work,

5747
02:27:46,510 --> 02:27:47,440
you can't do anything.

5748
02:27:47,530 --> 02:27:51,790
You were experiencing that combination
apparently of the malaria medication and

5749
02:27:51,791 --> 02:27:53,910
alcohol is like a crazy combination.

5750
02:27:54,300 --> 02:27:58,910
And then you got to that jet lag and the
trauma of being separated from my kids.

5751
02:27:59,840 --> 02:28:01,090
The malaria pills on their own.

5752
02:28:01,160 --> 02:28:01,993
Yeah.

5753
02:28:02,650 --> 02:28:03,483
I looked at her,

5754
02:28:03,700 --> 02:28:04,810
I left Harare,

5755
02:28:05,260 --> 02:28:05,920
uh,

5756
02:28:05,920 --> 02:28:06,880
to the sound of my,

5757
02:28:06,940 --> 02:28:07,420
My,

5758
02:28:07,420 --> 02:28:09,490
my eldest child screaming,

5759
02:28:09,491 --> 02:28:10,420
daddy don't go.

5760
02:28:12,090 --> 02:28:13,390
Even now I can't talk about,

5761
02:28:15,340 --> 02:28:18,130
Ooh God.

5762
02:28:19,330 --> 02:28:19,511
See,

5763
02:28:19,511 --> 02:28:20,710
it's not worth having kids.

5764
02:28:20,870 --> 02:28:21,703
No,

5765
02:28:21,890 --> 02:28:22,191
no,

5766
02:28:22,191 --> 02:28:22,970
it isn't.

5767
02:28:22,970 --> 02:28:23,803
Yeah,

5768
02:28:24,260 --> 02:28:25,093
I have one.

5769
02:28:25,220 --> 02:28:26,300
I have a 17 year old.

5770
02:28:26,360 --> 02:28:26,811
Yes.

5771
02:28:26,811 --> 02:28:27,261
It's good.

5772
02:28:27,261 --> 02:28:28,094
They're on their own now.

5773
02:28:28,700 --> 02:28:30,200
In the year you can just write them off.

5774
02:28:30,410 --> 02:28:30,940
Yeah,

5775
02:28:30,940 --> 02:28:31,773
that's right.

5776
02:28:32,330 --> 02:28:33,810
Next year he's going to call it.

5777
02:28:34,640 --> 02:28:35,300
But anyway,

5778
02:28:35,300 --> 02:28:36,410
if you are out there,

5779
02:28:37,290 --> 02:28:37,970
yeah.

5780
02:28:37,970 --> 02:28:39,190
Get on meds and stay on them.

5781
02:28:39,280 --> 02:28:39,670
Yeah.

5782
02:28:39,670 --> 02:28:41,090
Like Brody should have stayed on his meds.

5783
02:28:41,120 --> 02:28:41,570
Well,

5784
02:28:41,570 --> 02:28:42,051
you know,

5785
02:28:42,051 --> 02:28:42,884
I just,

5786
02:28:43,260 --> 02:28:48,260
I wish we could have all known and how
he was and how close he was to that.

5787
02:28:48,770 --> 02:28:49,131
Yeah.

5788
02:28:49,131 --> 02:28:49,850
Well that's the thing.

5789
02:28:49,850 --> 02:28:50,211
It's like,

5790
02:28:50,211 --> 02:28:51,320
people think like,

5791
02:28:51,710 --> 02:28:52,610
uh,

5792
02:28:52,880 --> 02:28:56,030
like suicide things that
if you're close to suicide,

5793
02:28:56,031 --> 02:28:59,900
it's the most rational choice
you'll ever make when you're,

5794
02:28:59,930 --> 02:29:00,950
when you're that close.

5795
02:29:01,310 --> 02:29:01,670
Right.

5796
02:29:01,670 --> 02:29:05,030
It just seems like the most sensible
way to the issue this because it's

5797
02:29:05,031 --> 02:29:06,260
otherwise it's too much pain.

5798
02:29:06,290 --> 02:29:06,950
Yeah.

5799
02:29:06,950 --> 02:29:08,420
I heard someone describe it as,

5800
02:29:08,421 --> 02:29:08,930
um,

5801
02:29:08,930 --> 02:29:10,760
it's not even on a
commercial decision burning.

5802
02:29:10,761 --> 02:29:12,200
It's jumping out of a burning building.

5803
02:29:13,710 --> 02:29:16,430
It's like there's that choice
into the burning building or,

5804
02:29:16,490 --> 02:29:17,000
yeah.

5805
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:18,170
What's that feeling right where you go,

5806
02:29:18,171 --> 02:29:19,610
this is not an emotional decision.

5807
02:29:19,611 --> 02:29:19,761
I mean,

5808
02:29:19,761 --> 02:29:20,594
there's no choice.

5809
02:29:20,600 --> 02:29:22,910
I've had two friends hang
themselves this year.

5810
02:29:23,060 --> 02:29:23,480
Yeah.

5811
02:29:23,480 --> 02:29:24,313
Wow.

5812
02:29:24,350 --> 02:29:24,940
Yeah.

5813
02:29:24,940 --> 02:29:25,830
I mean that,

5814
02:29:26,360 --> 02:29:26,751
that is,

5815
02:29:26,751 --> 02:29:28,430
I never thought I would ever say that.

5816
02:29:28,850 --> 02:29:29,380
Yeah.

5817
02:29:29,380 --> 02:29:32,720
I never thought that that would be a way
that people would be going out either.

5818
02:29:32,780 --> 02:29:33,320
Yeah.

5819
02:29:33,320 --> 02:29:35,100
I remember when we had Drake say there.

5820
02:29:35,630 --> 02:29:36,170
Yeah.

5821
02:29:36,170 --> 02:29:36,621
Oh,

5822
02:29:36,621 --> 02:29:37,454
he was hard.

5823
02:29:37,580 --> 02:29:38,030
Yeah.

5824
02:29:38,030 --> 02:29:38,940
That was a hard one.

5825
02:29:38,980 --> 02:29:41,120
I knew Drake back in the,

5826
02:29:41,150 --> 02:29:41,770
uh,

5827
02:29:41,770 --> 02:29:44,180
but essentially my open mic days.

5828
02:29:44,210 --> 02:29:44,630
Yeah.

5829
02:29:44,630 --> 02:29:45,411
He was a,

5830
02:29:45,411 --> 02:29:48,460
an established comedian in Boston
and I was just starting out.

5831
02:29:49,970 --> 02:29:51,530
Oh yeah.

5832
02:29:51,620 --> 02:29:54,380
But so even though I'm
happy that my brain injury,

5833
02:29:54,830 --> 02:29:55,200
yeah.

5834
02:29:55,200 --> 02:29:56,720
Seems to have cured my depression.

5835
02:29:56,750 --> 02:29:57,980
That's fucking crazy.

5836
02:29:58,100 --> 02:30:03,080
Do you know the brain injury was
responsible for Sam Kinison the car crash?

5837
02:30:03,081 --> 02:30:03,231
Right?

5838
02:30:03,231 --> 02:30:03,530
Yeah.

5839
02:30:03,530 --> 02:30:06,020
We got hit by a car when he was
a kid and became this wild man.

5840
02:30:06,110 --> 02:30:06,500
Yeah.

5841
02:30:06,500 --> 02:30:07,520
Same thing with Roseanne.

5842
02:30:07,521 --> 02:30:10,550
I mean one of the reasons why I wanted
to have Roseanne on the podcast and talk

5843
02:30:10,551 --> 02:30:11,180
about her,

5844
02:30:11,180 --> 02:30:12,140
her issue with,

5845
02:30:12,141 --> 02:30:12,530
uh,

5846
02:30:12,530 --> 02:30:15,560
her television show and everything and
her outbursts and all the crazy stuff she

5847
02:30:15,561 --> 02:30:16,400
says on Twitter.

5848
02:30:16,550 --> 02:30:16,900
Yeah.

5849
02:30:16,900 --> 02:30:17,030
It's,

5850
02:30:17,030 --> 02:30:20,060
cause I know her and I know her past.

5851
02:30:20,061 --> 02:30:22,070
And so I right away at the
beginning of the podcast,

5852
02:30:22,071 --> 02:30:22,700
I was like,

5853
02:30:22,700 --> 02:30:25,080
let's get into what
happened to you and it,

5854
02:30:25,150 --> 02:30:26,720
cause I don't think she
talked about it that much.

5855
02:30:26,780 --> 02:30:27,620
She was hit by a car.

5856
02:30:27,621 --> 02:30:30,650
She was in a fucking Sikich is
psychiatric corps for nine months.

5857
02:30:30,800 --> 02:30:31,220
Yeah.

5858
02:30:31,220 --> 02:30:34,400
Like she was gone and she was never
the same person to get on with this.

5859
02:30:34,460 --> 02:30:35,600
She was 15 years old.

5860
02:30:36,040 --> 02:30:39,500
She was walking across the street and
someone had glare and their eyes from the

5861
02:30:39,501 --> 02:30:41,750
sun and didn't see her hit her with a car.

5862
02:30:41,751 --> 02:30:42,584
The fucking,

5863
02:30:42,650 --> 02:30:44,270
the hood ornament went into her head.

5864
02:30:44,540 --> 02:30:44,811
I mean,

5865
02:30:44,811 --> 02:30:46,670
she had a severe brain injury.

5866
02:30:47,060 --> 02:30:49,160
She couldn't count anymore.

5867
02:30:49,190 --> 02:30:50,480
She couldn't do math anymore.

5868
02:30:50,540 --> 02:30:51,200
She was,

5869
02:30:51,200 --> 02:30:55,280
she was a very smart student before
then and then crippled by it afterwards.

5870
02:30:55,310 --> 02:30:55,640
Yeah.

5871
02:30:55,640 --> 02:30:59,360
And then for nine months she was in
a psych ward and she talked about it.

5872
02:30:59,550 --> 02:30:59,840
I'm like,

5873
02:30:59,840 --> 02:31:01,690
I wanted people to know like this is,

5874
02:31:01,750 --> 02:31:03,440
anybody knows that they know now,

5875
02:31:03,441 --> 02:31:05,330
hopefully more than they knew then.

5876
02:31:05,331 --> 02:31:07,100
But people that work with her did,

5877
02:31:07,101 --> 02:31:08,210
so when they were writing her off,

5878
02:31:08,211 --> 02:31:08,391
I'm like,

5879
02:31:08,391 --> 02:31:09,170
Jesus Christ,

5880
02:31:09,170 --> 02:31:11,390
this is like taking a person
with a broken leg and saying,

5881
02:31:11,480 --> 02:31:11,931
you know,

5882
02:31:11,931 --> 02:31:13,250
I'm mad at you that you can't run.

5883
02:31:13,850 --> 02:31:14,211
Yeah.

5884
02:31:14,211 --> 02:31:14,940
And this is the thing.

5885
02:31:14,940 --> 02:31:16,070
And like whatever your,

5886
02:31:16,190 --> 02:31:16,580
I mean,

5887
02:31:16,580 --> 02:31:19,570
obviously Roseanne said
some crazy and terrible and,

5888
02:31:20,010 --> 02:31:21,630
and messed up a lot of people's lives,

5889
02:31:22,050 --> 02:31:24,480
but she's also a genius.

5890
02:31:24,710 --> 02:31:26,110
She's a comedic genius.

5891
02:31:26,250 --> 02:31:30,630
She also made that show one of the best
shows on TV when it was originally on

5892
02:31:30,631 --> 02:31:30,820
the,

5893
02:31:30,820 --> 02:31:32,040
she's always done crazy shit.

5894
02:31:32,070 --> 02:31:34,590
You remember once you grabbed her crotch
and spit when she did the national

5895
02:31:34,591 --> 02:31:35,670
anthem and everybody hated her,

5896
02:31:35,671 --> 02:31:36,580
then they went crazy.

5897
02:31:36,581 --> 02:31:39,090
And this is like early two
thousands she did that.

5898
02:31:39,091 --> 02:31:40,290
She was always wild.

5899
02:31:40,291 --> 02:31:42,000
But that was why she
was so good as a calm.

5900
02:31:42,010 --> 02:31:43,070
That was her appeal.

5901
02:31:43,080 --> 02:31:44,700
She did not give a fuck.

5902
02:31:44,730 --> 02:31:45,563
I'm predictable.

5903
02:31:46,050 --> 02:31:46,661
Just wild.

5904
02:31:46,661 --> 02:31:49,130
And that is like Kinison and
it came out of head injuries,

5905
02:31:49,380 --> 02:31:49,850
you know,

5906
02:31:49,850 --> 02:31:51,390
really well.

5907
02:31:51,391 --> 02:31:54,870
There was the famous story of the guy
who was I guess working in a mine.

5908
02:31:54,870 --> 02:31:56,130
There was an explosion and uh,

5909
02:31:56,550 --> 02:31:59,910
like rebar went through his brain and
they said before that he was the nicest

5910
02:31:59,911 --> 02:32:01,350
guy and after that he became,

5911
02:32:01,351 --> 02:32:02,670
they said he became evil.

5912
02:32:02,760 --> 02:32:03,990
He was just an evil person.

5913
02:32:04,590 --> 02:32:07,050
After this rebar went
through the brain and a,

5914
02:32:07,051 --> 02:32:11,100
I mean there's also happens and whether
the Texas school book depository shooter

5915
02:32:11,250 --> 02:32:11,650
and were not,

5916
02:32:11,650 --> 02:32:12,770
it wasn't school book depository,

5917
02:32:13,870 --> 02:32:14,703
Texas Tower,

5918
02:32:15,180 --> 02:32:17,970
the Texas Tower shooter to Texas
Tower shooter had a brain tumor.

5919
02:32:18,520 --> 02:32:19,860
They found that out after he died.

5920
02:32:19,861 --> 02:32:20,310
Like,

5921
02:32:20,310 --> 02:32:20,500
Whoa,

5922
02:32:20,500 --> 02:32:21,333
this is what it was.

5923
02:32:21,480 --> 02:32:24,150
But you also have people who have
suffered brain injuries and come out of it

5924
02:32:24,151 --> 02:32:25,260
being able to speak French.

5925
02:32:25,261 --> 02:32:25,640
Yes.

5926
02:32:25,640 --> 02:32:26,040
Yes.

5927
02:32:26,040 --> 02:32:27,120
Or play piano.

5928
02:32:27,270 --> 02:32:27,690
Yes.

5929
02:32:27,690 --> 02:32:28,050
Yes.

5930
02:32:28,050 --> 02:32:29,130
I know oral spray paint it.

5931
02:32:29,190 --> 02:32:30,660
They probably have a brain injury,

5932
02:32:32,660 --> 02:32:33,770
but yeah,

5933
02:32:34,590 --> 02:32:38,130
I'll be able to like suddenly can
paint photo realistic paintings.

5934
02:32:38,150 --> 02:32:38,730
Yeah.

5935
02:32:38,730 --> 02:32:39,270
Yes.

5936
02:32:39,270 --> 02:32:41,220
I never had any artistic ability before,

5937
02:32:41,221 --> 02:32:43,830
but they have a brain
injury and it unlocks it.

5938
02:32:44,510 --> 02:32:47,430
All I got was sobriety
at to call shake sample.

5939
02:32:48,090 --> 02:32:48,871
It's amazing though.

5940
02:32:48,871 --> 02:32:50,100
It does happen for real.

5941
02:32:50,130 --> 02:32:50,641
Well they don't.

5942
02:32:50,641 --> 02:32:51,030
Yeah,

5943
02:32:51,030 --> 02:32:52,560
they can learn it quicker I think.

5944
02:32:52,561 --> 02:32:55,050
I don't think they know it
and don't come out knowing it.

5945
02:32:55,730 --> 02:32:55,920
Well,

5946
02:32:55,920 --> 02:33:00,390
the piano I've heard peanut field like
literally could sit down and knew what to

5947
02:33:00,391 --> 02:33:00,840
do.

5948
02:33:00,840 --> 02:33:01,051
Well,

5949
02:33:01,051 --> 02:33:02,250
there's certain things that happened,

5950
02:33:02,251 --> 02:33:02,461
right.

5951
02:33:02,461 --> 02:33:04,800
If people have certain spectrum issues,

5952
02:33:04,980 --> 02:33:05,221
right.

5953
02:33:05,221 --> 02:33:07,080
Where there are far better at mathematics,

5954
02:33:07,350 --> 02:33:09,520
far worse at social interactions,

5955
02:33:09,780 --> 02:33:10,560
there's,

5956
02:33:10,560 --> 02:33:15,560
there's pathways that are more lubed for
you to figure things out that aren't as

5957
02:33:16,260 --> 02:33:21,260
confused by social issues
or social stigmas or just
normal human communication.

5958
02:33:23,280 --> 02:33:24,830
And I think there's people in history,

5959
02:33:24,880 --> 02:33:25,330
a lot of them are,

5960
02:33:25,330 --> 02:33:26,163
a lot of them,

5961
02:33:26,190 --> 02:33:28,890
a lot of super fucking
geniuses are on spectrum.

5962
02:33:28,890 --> 02:33:30,840
Einstein didn't speak till he was five.

5963
02:33:31,320 --> 02:33:31,980
Jesus.

5964
02:33:31,980 --> 02:33:32,430
Yeah.

5965
02:33:32,430 --> 02:33:33,010
Yeah.

5966
02:33:33,010 --> 02:33:33,720
Like they thought he was,

5967
02:33:33,720 --> 02:33:34,530
they thought he was,

5968
02:33:34,530 --> 02:33:35,700
he was mentally retarded.

5969
02:33:36,030 --> 02:33:36,510
Wow.

5970
02:33:36,510 --> 02:33:37,040
Yeah.

5971
02:33:37,040 --> 02:33:38,250
That was back when they
should use that word.

5972
02:33:38,300 --> 02:33:38,430
Yeah,

5973
02:33:38,430 --> 02:33:38,940
that's right.

5974
02:33:38,940 --> 02:33:39,600
Yeah.

5975
02:33:39,600 --> 02:33:40,433
Now you can get in trouble.

5976
02:33:40,590 --> 02:33:40,870
Yeah.

5977
02:33:40,870 --> 02:33:41,703
Sorry.

5978
02:33:42,280 --> 02:33:42,960
Yeah.

5979
02:33:42,960 --> 02:33:43,793
Um,

5980
02:33:43,800 --> 02:33:46,110
when you had the head injury,

5981
02:33:46,320 --> 02:33:49,680
so how much time was it
before you felt like,

5982
02:33:49,740 --> 02:33:51,810
did you just stop drinking on the spot?

5983
02:33:51,830 --> 02:33:52,150
Yeah,

5984
02:33:52,150 --> 02:33:57,150
I think it was December 22nd I remember
Jackie was wanting to visit you and you

5985
02:33:58,250 --> 02:33:59,160
remember it was Hawaii,

5986
02:33:59,161 --> 02:33:59,401
right?

5987
02:33:59,401 --> 02:34:00,020
They were going up.

5988
02:34:00,020 --> 02:34:00,211
No,

5989
02:34:00,211 --> 02:34:00,631
New York.

5990
02:34:00,631 --> 02:34:01,021
New York.

5991
02:34:01,021 --> 02:34:01,141
Yeah.

5992
02:34:01,141 --> 02:34:01,974
I was going to go to

5993
02:34:03,920 --> 02:34:05,160
Christina Molina to New York.

5994
02:34:05,161 --> 02:34:06,210
We're going to go near for the,

5995
02:34:06,240 --> 02:34:06,961
for the holidays.

5996
02:34:06,961 --> 02:34:08,250
For Christmas and new years.

5997
02:34:08,400 --> 02:34:09,150
My wife was like,

5998
02:34:09,150 --> 02:34:09,361
no,

5999
02:34:09,361 --> 02:34:11,010
you're not because you did this,

6000
02:34:11,011 --> 02:34:12,720
you don't get to go to New York with your,

6001
02:34:12,810 --> 02:34:13,710
with your family.

6002
02:34:13,740 --> 02:34:14,300
And they went,

6003
02:34:14,300 --> 02:34:15,320
they went that way.

6004
02:34:15,330 --> 02:34:15,721
But you know,

6005
02:34:15,721 --> 02:34:16,441
but then again,

6006
02:34:16,441 --> 02:34:17,030
Chrissy,

6007
02:34:17,030 --> 02:34:18,100
I woke up in the ICU

6008
02:34:18,100 --> 02:34:21,580
and Christina Molina were there and
we celebrated Christmas in the Icu.

6009
02:34:21,790 --> 02:34:22,480
Wow.

6010
02:34:22,480 --> 02:34:23,020
You know,

6011
02:34:23,020 --> 02:34:24,880
and that was a pivotal moment.

6012
02:34:24,910 --> 02:34:25,510
Yeah.

6013
02:34:25,510 --> 02:34:25,990
Yeah.

6014
02:34:25,990 --> 02:34:27,760
So you just decided on the spot.

6015
02:34:27,761 --> 02:34:28,594
No more drinking.

6016
02:34:28,600 --> 02:34:28,990
Yeah.

6017
02:34:28,990 --> 02:34:29,550
And just said,

6018
02:34:29,550 --> 02:34:29,841
all right,

6019
02:34:29,841 --> 02:34:31,230
I think I'm done.

6020
02:34:31,740 --> 02:34:32,240
And,

6021
02:34:32,240 --> 02:34:32,780
and,

6022
02:34:32,780 --> 02:34:33,311
and again,

6023
02:34:33,311 --> 02:34:34,390
I was preparing cause I,

6024
02:34:34,400 --> 02:34:37,270
but a few years earlier,

6025
02:34:37,330 --> 02:34:38,890
like it's about maybe eight years earlier,

6026
02:34:38,891 --> 02:34:39,990
I tried quitting drinking.

6027
02:34:40,040 --> 02:34:40,960
You told me about this,

6028
02:34:40,961 --> 02:34:42,640
you were talking to me about pot.

6029
02:34:43,050 --> 02:34:43,520
Yeah.

6030
02:34:43,520 --> 02:34:45,120
We were talking about you really are.

6031
02:34:45,121 --> 02:34:46,060
I've got to stop drinking.

6032
02:34:46,090 --> 02:34:48,040
How far did you get a,

6033
02:34:48,041 --> 02:34:50,320
I went to a year and a
half without drinking.

6034
02:34:51,040 --> 02:34:51,970
I think that's pretty good.

6035
02:34:52,020 --> 02:34:52,550
Yeah.

6036
02:34:52,550 --> 02:34:53,030
I hate it.

6037
02:34:53,030 --> 02:34:53,740
Hated it.

6038
02:34:53,740 --> 02:34:54,820
Hated every minute of it.

6039
02:34:54,940 --> 02:34:55,420
Really?

6040
02:34:55,420 --> 02:34:55,960
Yeah,

6041
02:34:55,960 --> 02:34:56,793
it was like every,

6042
02:34:56,870 --> 02:34:57,311
every day.

6043
02:34:57,311 --> 02:34:59,800
I thought it would be
nice to drink every day.

6044
02:35:00,490 --> 02:35:02,050
He just hung in there
for a few hundred days.

6045
02:35:02,200 --> 02:35:02,800
Yeah.

6046
02:35:02,800 --> 02:35:03,280
Well,

6047
02:35:03,280 --> 02:35:04,030
you know,

6048
02:35:04,030 --> 02:35:04,863
but like this time,

6049
02:35:05,110 --> 02:35:05,710
yeah.

6050
02:35:05,710 --> 02:35:06,161
But even now,

6051
02:35:06,161 --> 02:35:07,000
like I'll still let go.

6052
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:07,833
Oh yeah.

6053
02:35:08,090 --> 02:35:08,440
I think,

6054
02:35:08,440 --> 02:35:08,600
yeah,

6055
02:35:08,600 --> 02:35:10,660
I do miss the taste of Scotch,

6056
02:35:10,720 --> 02:35:11,160
you know,

6057
02:35:11,160 --> 02:35:14,530
because you've worked so hard to
learn to like it and you know,

6058
02:35:14,700 --> 02:35:15,970
you really like Scott.

6059
02:35:17,230 --> 02:35:19,810
What are the positive
benefits of not drinking,

6060
02:35:20,140 --> 02:35:21,160
of not drinking?

6061
02:35:21,580 --> 02:35:22,413
Um,

6062
02:35:22,450 --> 02:35:23,283
you don't hit me.

6063
02:35:23,560 --> 02:35:24,393
That's true.

6064
02:35:24,400 --> 02:35:25,660
But that's the only positive for you,

6065
02:35:25,661 --> 02:35:26,050
Paul.

6066
02:35:26,050 --> 02:35:26,471
That's true.

6067
02:35:26,471 --> 02:35:28,480
I thought we were really affect me.

6068
02:35:29,160 --> 02:35:29,780
Whatever.

6069
02:35:29,780 --> 02:35:30,400
Uh,

6070
02:35:30,400 --> 02:35:32,560
I think the,

6071
02:35:32,561 --> 02:35:33,394
uh,

6072
02:35:33,790 --> 02:35:34,750
not that,

6073
02:35:34,751 --> 02:35:36,150
that I don't do anything to,

6074
02:35:36,210 --> 02:35:36,820
uh,

6075
02:35:36,820 --> 02:35:39,910
unknowingly embarrass my daughter
if I need to embarrass my daughter.

6076
02:35:39,911 --> 02:35:41,470
Now it's deliberate,

6077
02:35:41,920 --> 02:35:42,753
you know?

6078
02:35:42,770 --> 02:35:43,603
Uh,

6079
02:35:44,080 --> 02:35:44,590
that,

6080
02:35:44,590 --> 02:35:44,831
yeah,

6081
02:35:44,831 --> 02:35:45,580
this mostly just,

6082
02:35:45,580 --> 02:35:46,413
just,

6083
02:35:46,510 --> 02:35:46,930
you know,

6084
02:35:46,930 --> 02:35:48,010
remembering things,

6085
02:35:48,011 --> 02:35:50,200
knowing where I was the night before.

6086
02:35:50,770 --> 02:35:55,150
Now I don't drink and I embarrassed my
son every single day by walking around.

6087
02:35:55,170 --> 02:35:55,700
Yes.

6088
02:35:55,700 --> 02:35:57,150
Just and just,

6089
02:35:57,510 --> 02:35:58,480
just being next to them.

6090
02:35:58,481 --> 02:35:58,840
Yeah.

6091
02:35:58,840 --> 02:35:59,141
It's like,

6092
02:35:59,141 --> 02:35:59,830
come on dad.

6093
02:35:59,830 --> 02:36:04,510
Do you think you are a genetic
alcoholic or is this like a learn thing?

6094
02:36:04,540 --> 02:36:04,661
Well,

6095
02:36:04,661 --> 02:36:07,600
it's hard to say cause I mean
obviously alcoholism runs in my family,

6096
02:36:07,630 --> 02:36:09,190
but is that just because you know,

6097
02:36:09,191 --> 02:36:11,170
we were raised by a horrible alcoholic.

6098
02:36:11,800 --> 02:36:14,830
Do you think it's genetically genetic?

6099
02:36:15,220 --> 02:36:17,830
It's probably genetic
predisposition to it.

6100
02:36:18,020 --> 02:36:18,550
Yeah.

6101
02:36:18,550 --> 02:36:21,130
I think there's genetic
connections to almost all behavior.

6102
02:36:21,160 --> 02:36:21,730
Yeah.

6103
02:36:21,730 --> 02:36:22,330
Yup.

6104
02:36:22,330 --> 02:36:22,541
Yeah.

6105
02:36:22,541 --> 02:36:23,010
I don't think,

6106
02:36:23,010 --> 02:36:23,650
you know,

6107
02:36:23,650 --> 02:36:23,831
you know,

6108
02:36:23,831 --> 02:36:24,664
I don't think there's a,

6109
02:36:24,670 --> 02:36:26,410
there's a lot of real freewill.

6110
02:36:26,570 --> 02:36:27,403
Right?

6111
02:36:27,820 --> 02:36:30,880
I've come to that more
and more as I get older.

6112
02:36:30,881 --> 02:36:32,050
I mean I battle with it.

6113
02:36:32,051 --> 02:36:34,930
Cause obviously there are conscious
choices that you can make and yeah,

6114
02:36:34,960 --> 02:36:39,960
especially when you really make an effort
to move into a certain path of the way

6115
02:36:40,481 --> 02:36:41,950
of the thinking and believing.

6116
02:36:41,951 --> 02:36:43,660
But what's causing that,

6117
02:36:43,720 --> 02:36:44,200
you know,

6118
02:36:44,200 --> 02:36:47,230
how much of his life experience
you can make conscious efforts to,

6119
02:36:47,470 --> 02:36:51,100
I guess ameliorate the
influences of your genes.

6120
02:36:51,610 --> 02:36:51,971
But it's like,

6121
02:36:51,971 --> 02:36:52,540
it's like you could,

6122
02:36:52,540 --> 02:36:53,440
you could live healthy,

6123
02:36:53,441 --> 02:36:57,760
eat healthy and avoid risks and you're
still going to probably die around 110 at

6124
02:36:57,761 --> 02:36:58,211
best.

6125
02:36:58,211 --> 02:36:59,800
At best if everything goes great,

6126
02:36:59,830 --> 02:37:02,140
unless some new advanced medicine,

6127
02:37:02,260 --> 02:37:03,660
we're going farther that guys come on.

6128
02:37:03,810 --> 02:37:06,190
We very well could we very well could.

6129
02:37:06,191 --> 02:37:06,401
I mean,

6130
02:37:06,401 --> 02:37:08,380
I had David Sinclair from Harvard on,

6131
02:37:08,890 --> 02:37:09,280
uh,

6132
02:37:09,280 --> 02:37:14,050
two weeks ago who's a life extension
specialist who fascinating shit.

6133
02:37:14,460 --> 02:37:16,250
We've got to stop those
telex and I'm snapping

6134
02:37:16,250 --> 02:37:16,610
off.

6135
02:37:16,610 --> 02:37:17,443
I remember the,

6136
02:37:17,700 --> 02:37:17,960
the,

6137
02:37:17,960 --> 02:37:19,700
the notion because people
will always talk about it.

6138
02:37:19,701 --> 02:37:19,821
You know,

6139
02:37:19,821 --> 02:37:22,310
human lifespan is we used
to live to be 40 on air,

6140
02:37:22,460 --> 02:37:25,670
but human lifespan hasn't
changed at all since,

6141
02:37:25,671 --> 02:37:26,840
since essentially,

6142
02:37:26,841 --> 02:37:27,620
uh,

6143
02:37:27,620 --> 02:37:28,453
the beginnings of,

6144
02:37:28,460 --> 02:37:31,370
of human beings hasn't changed at all.

6145
02:37:32,060 --> 02:37:32,630
The,

6146
02:37:32,630 --> 02:37:36,080
the oldest possible lifespan is
still exactly the same as it was,

6147
02:37:36,590 --> 02:37:37,050
you know,

6148
02:37:37,050 --> 02:37:37,640
uh,

6149
02:37:37,640 --> 02:37:38,480
50,000 years,

6150
02:37:39,350 --> 02:37:39,980
you know,

6151
02:37:39,980 --> 02:37:40,813
and has just,

6152
02:37:40,910 --> 02:37:41,990
it's just more people,

6153
02:37:41,991 --> 02:37:43,750
fewer people are dying young frack,

6154
02:37:43,790 --> 02:37:44,270
right?

6155
02:37:44,270 --> 02:37:46,670
More people are living
close to their potential.

6156
02:37:46,700 --> 02:37:48,590
And a lot of that is infant mortality.

6157
02:37:48,591 --> 02:37:50,270
If you look at the actual statistics,

6158
02:37:50,271 --> 02:37:51,590
the reason why it's so low,

6159
02:37:51,980 --> 02:37:54,660
it's not necessarily that
no one lived to be 65 back.

6160
02:37:56,780 --> 02:37:58,820
Babies died thousands of years ago.

6161
02:37:58,821 --> 02:38:00,530
People did live to be over a hundred,

6162
02:38:00,960 --> 02:38:01,760
but back then,

6163
02:38:01,760 --> 02:38:04,370
scratch your foot and
then died two weeks later.

6164
02:38:04,610 --> 02:38:05,200
You know what I mean?

6165
02:38:05,200 --> 02:38:05,980
Yes.

6166
02:38:05,980 --> 02:38:06,813
Yeah.

6167
02:38:07,340 --> 02:38:09,800
But maximum human lifespan
hasn't changed at all.

6168
02:38:10,220 --> 02:38:12,350
And that's the thing that maybe
is going to start changing.

6169
02:38:12,351 --> 02:38:13,400
Do you exercise at all?

6170
02:38:13,610 --> 02:38:14,330
Never.

6171
02:38:14,330 --> 02:38:14,631
Never,

6172
02:38:14,631 --> 02:38:15,430
ever in your life.

6173
02:38:15,430 --> 02:38:15,850
Uh,

6174
02:38:15,850 --> 02:38:16,311
I mean,

6175
02:38:16,311 --> 02:38:17,600
as a kid I liked sports.

6176
02:38:17,840 --> 02:38:19,640
Never like go for a hike or anything.

6177
02:38:19,700 --> 02:38:20,570
Very rarely.

6178
02:38:20,840 --> 02:38:21,600
Very refill.

6179
02:38:21,600 --> 02:38:22,250
Really good.

6180
02:38:22,250 --> 02:38:23,060
I probably would,

6181
02:38:23,060 --> 02:38:23,360
yeah.

6182
02:38:23,360 --> 02:38:24,680
It would relieve a lot of tension.

6183
02:38:24,760 --> 02:38:25,140
Just,

6184
02:38:25,140 --> 02:38:26,030
just a little height,

6185
02:38:26,520 --> 02:38:26,990
you know,

6186
02:38:26,990 --> 02:38:28,250
you don't have to do anything crazy.

6187
02:38:28,430 --> 02:38:28,790
Yeah.

6188
02:38:28,790 --> 02:38:28,941
No,

6189
02:38:28,941 --> 02:38:29,480
I keep meaning,

6190
02:38:29,480 --> 02:38:30,320
especially now that I'm,

6191
02:38:30,380 --> 02:38:32,600
I think not just getting older,

6192
02:38:32,601 --> 02:38:33,560
but actually old.

6193
02:38:33,620 --> 02:38:34,453
Yes.

6194
02:38:34,800 --> 02:38:36,140
I'm actually old dude.

6195
02:38:36,141 --> 02:38:37,400
We were young when we met.

6196
02:38:37,430 --> 02:38:38,510
I know old people.

6197
02:38:38,511 --> 02:38:39,170
I know.

6198
02:38:39,170 --> 02:38:40,670
If a kid sees us like,

6199
02:38:40,671 --> 02:38:42,590
oh this is old dudes in their 50s yeah.

6200
02:38:42,590 --> 02:38:43,423
We're old dudes.

6201
02:38:43,430 --> 02:38:44,130
Yeah,

6202
02:38:44,130 --> 02:38:44,330
I know.

6203
02:38:44,330 --> 02:38:44,721
It's crazy.

6204
02:38:44,721 --> 02:38:44,840
I'm,

6205
02:38:44,840 --> 02:38:44,980
yeah,

6206
02:38:44,980 --> 02:38:45,813
I'm weird.

6207
02:38:45,830 --> 02:38:50,000
I'm really almost 60 56
that's almost 60 it is,

6208
02:38:50,030 --> 02:38:50,450
you know,

6209
02:38:50,450 --> 02:38:51,210
it's closing in line.

6210
02:38:51,210 --> 02:38:51,690
Yeah.

6211
02:38:51,690 --> 02:38:53,990
And a terrible looking 39.

6212
02:38:54,200 --> 02:38:55,033
It's true.

6213
02:38:55,970 --> 02:38:56,900
Which is good though.

6214
02:38:56,960 --> 02:38:58,760
That gives you longevity in this business.

6215
02:38:59,020 --> 02:38:59,710
Yeah.

6216
02:38:59,710 --> 02:39:00,700
That's my staff director.

6217
02:39:00,720 --> 02:39:01,340
Yeah.

6218
02:39:01,340 --> 02:39:05,570
That's why Steve Martin looks good cause
he never looked Young's hair from the

6219
02:39:05,571 --> 02:39:05,990
jump.

6220
02:39:05,990 --> 02:39:06,450
Yeah.

6221
02:39:06,450 --> 02:39:07,270
Yeah.

6222
02:39:07,270 --> 02:39:07,730
Um,

6223
02:39:07,730 --> 02:39:07,911
yeah,

6224
02:39:07,911 --> 02:39:10,550
you could just listen to
like books on tape and walk.

6225
02:39:10,551 --> 02:39:11,510
It's great man.

6226
02:39:11,600 --> 02:39:11,811
You know,

6227
02:39:11,811 --> 02:39:14,520
just find a place of
like go Runyon Canyon.

6228
02:39:14,550 --> 02:39:15,383
Just go walk it.

6229
02:39:15,860 --> 02:39:18,500
It's so nice cause you can do it
at your own pace and it's so good.

6230
02:39:18,530 --> 02:39:23,530
Elevates your heart rate without anything
crazy enough to go out and have to do

6231
02:39:23,541 --> 02:39:23,781
anything.

6232
02:39:23,781 --> 02:39:25,430
Nuts started.

6233
02:39:25,450 --> 02:39:26,690
You'll amaze 11 on the road.

6234
02:39:26,940 --> 02:39:28,010
So I hadn't been doing it on the road,

6235
02:39:28,011 --> 02:39:31,070
but I haven't like started doing like
some like lightweight lifting and that

6236
02:39:31,071 --> 02:39:31,780
sort of thing.

6237
02:39:31,780 --> 02:39:32,101
Great.

6238
02:39:32,101 --> 02:39:32,390
Yeah.

6239
02:39:32,390 --> 02:39:32,750
Yeah.

6240
02:39:32,750 --> 02:39:33,041
Do you know what?

6241
02:39:33,041 --> 02:39:37,340
Just hire someone feels good to come
over your house and tell you to do it.

6242
02:39:37,400 --> 02:39:38,480
I think that's the way to do it.

6243
02:39:38,510 --> 02:39:39,600
Have someone else make you do it?

6244
02:39:39,710 --> 02:39:40,220
They're there.

6245
02:39:40,220 --> 02:39:41,060
10:00 AM you?

6246
02:39:41,061 --> 02:39:41,511
Oh Hi.

6247
02:39:41,511 --> 02:39:42,740
Bob are way out of it.

6248
02:39:43,330 --> 02:39:44,360
Yeah.

6249
02:39:44,990 --> 02:39:46,910
Get some hot Russian lady yells at you.

6250
02:39:47,270 --> 02:39:47,990
That sounds great.

6251
02:39:47,990 --> 02:39:48,680
Great.

6252
02:39:48,680 --> 02:39:49,970
Now there's my next divorce.

6253
02:39:53,090 --> 02:39:54,170
Are you still doing standup?

6254
02:39:54,171 --> 02:39:55,140
I know you're doing stand up.

6255
02:39:55,910 --> 02:39:56,870
You know what I am going to do?

6256
02:39:56,910 --> 02:39:57,920
I have to come up and again,

6257
02:39:58,010 --> 02:39:58,590
no.

6258
02:39:58,590 --> 02:39:59,030
Okay,

6259
02:39:59,030 --> 02:39:59,680
go ahead.

6260
02:39:59,680 --> 02:39:59,901
All right.

6261
02:39:59,901 --> 02:40:00,680
Last one.

6262
02:40:00,680 --> 02:40:01,460
All right.

6263
02:40:01,460 --> 02:40:01,760
But no,

6264
02:40:01,760 --> 02:40:03,560
I stopped stopped once I got doctor Ken.

6265
02:40:03,800 --> 02:40:03,981
Oh,

6266
02:40:03,981 --> 02:40:04,814
okay.

6267
02:40:05,120 --> 02:40:05,680
Stop,

6268
02:40:05,680 --> 02:40:06,513
you know,

6269
02:40:06,560 --> 02:40:08,710
stop doing stand up once
you got the television.

6270
02:40:08,840 --> 02:40:09,673
Yeah,

6271
02:40:09,790 --> 02:40:10,623
yeah.

6272
02:40:10,700 --> 02:40:11,533
I love that guy.

6273
02:40:12,020 --> 02:40:12,853
I don't see him enough.

6274
02:40:13,560 --> 02:40:14,100
It's,

6275
02:40:14,100 --> 02:40:15,870
it's cool to see you two guys together.

6276
02:40:16,410 --> 02:40:17,243
It is,

6277
02:40:17,460 --> 02:40:17,970
you know,

6278
02:40:17,970 --> 02:40:18,803
cause that's,

6279
02:40:19,110 --> 02:40:20,790
I don't want to say it's a lifetime ago,

6280
02:40:21,200 --> 02:40:22,030
last a lifetime,

6281
02:40:22,030 --> 02:40:23,730
but those are in your,

6282
02:40:23,860 --> 02:40:25,290
in 20s and 30s.

6283
02:40:25,660 --> 02:40:26,170
I mean,

6284
02:40:26,170 --> 02:40:28,860
I was a totally different
human being when I was 27.

6285
02:40:29,160 --> 02:40:30,810
You were 100%.

6286
02:40:30,840 --> 02:40:31,673
What's,

6287
02:40:32,310 --> 02:40:32,700
yeah,

6288
02:40:32,700 --> 02:40:33,810
I guess it was crazy.

6289
02:40:33,990 --> 02:40:34,650
I was,

6290
02:40:34,650 --> 02:40:36,150
I was completely insane.

6291
02:40:36,440 --> 02:40:36,690
What,

6292
02:40:36,690 --> 02:40:37,140
what,

6293
02:40:37,140 --> 02:40:39,030
what was the switch for you?

6294
02:40:39,870 --> 02:40:40,051
Well,

6295
02:40:40,051 --> 02:40:43,080
I've got older and wiser and
realize how fucking stupid it was.

6296
02:40:43,081 --> 02:40:43,740
But also,

6297
02:40:43,740 --> 02:40:44,041
uh,

6298
02:40:44,041 --> 02:40:46,260
I was only a few years
removed from fighting.

6299
02:40:46,710 --> 02:40:46,981
You know,

6300
02:40:46,981 --> 02:40:49,290
when I first started doing a news radio,

6301
02:40:49,291 --> 02:40:54,291
it was only like five years removed from
my last fight and I still was sparring.

6302
02:40:56,220 --> 02:40:57,990
So it's still getting
hit in the head a lot.

6303
02:40:58,050 --> 02:41:01,470
Would you like come in to work
with a face full of bruises?

6304
02:41:01,650 --> 02:41:01,831
No,

6305
02:41:01,831 --> 02:41:02,700
not that bad.

6306
02:41:02,790 --> 02:41:07,050
I started doing Jujitsu somewhere around
news radio to run 96 so that was like,

6307
02:41:07,320 --> 02:41:10,740
I stopped really s kickboxing
very much after that.

6308
02:41:11,130 --> 02:41:14,760
And then I think I stopped entirely
when I was like 30 I just realized like,

6309
02:41:14,761 --> 02:41:15,630
this is got to stop.

6310
02:41:15,660 --> 02:41:16,590
I gotta stop doing this.

6311
02:41:16,620 --> 02:41:17,431
So you weren't smart,

6312
02:41:17,431 --> 02:41:21,030
you like this fit guy that just left it
all behind or where you were always did

6313
02:41:21,031 --> 02:41:21,864
you always keep it up?

6314
02:41:22,170 --> 02:41:23,580
I work out for sanity.

6315
02:41:23,750 --> 02:41:26,250
I've always worked out for hand
and a lot of people that do that,

6316
02:41:26,251 --> 02:41:27,084
I need it,

6317
02:41:27,300 --> 02:41:27,811
you know,

6318
02:41:27,811 --> 02:41:29,280
for whatever it is.

6319
02:41:29,281 --> 02:41:34,281
And also like my personality was sort
of forged by having these moments of

6320
02:41:36,481 --> 02:41:39,030
clarity after extreme exertion.

6321
02:41:39,300 --> 02:41:39,481
You know,

6322
02:41:39,481 --> 02:41:40,280
there was those sort of,

6323
02:41:40,280 --> 02:41:41,640
my personnel was formed that way.

6324
02:41:41,641 --> 02:41:42,930
Like if I had a problem,

6325
02:41:43,200 --> 02:41:44,520
if I had something that
I was dealing with,

6326
02:41:44,521 --> 02:41:47,610
I would just blow it out at the gym and
then I'd have a better look at it and

6327
02:41:47,611 --> 02:41:50,040
probably wind up calling
somebody in apologizing or so.

6328
02:41:50,040 --> 02:41:50,820
Interesting.

6329
02:41:50,820 --> 02:41:54,120
It's like a rush of oxygen to the brain.

6330
02:41:54,180 --> 02:41:54,541
Yeah.

6331
02:41:54,541 --> 02:41:54,870
Well,

6332
02:41:54,870 --> 02:41:56,070
Russell Rush of oxygen,

6333
02:41:56,110 --> 02:41:57,750
the brain and maybe even more important,

6334
02:41:57,780 --> 02:42:01,950
more important that a
draining of excess energy.

6335
02:42:02,040 --> 02:42:02,280
Right?

6336
02:42:02,280 --> 02:42:03,040
Because I think,

6337
02:42:03,040 --> 02:42:03,630
uh,

6338
02:42:03,630 --> 02:42:04,380
once you,

6339
02:42:04,380 --> 02:42:06,390
if you develop a certain way,

6340
02:42:06,600 --> 02:42:11,600
like I did martial arts literally most
of my adult life and growing life up

6341
02:42:11,701 --> 02:42:12,534
until that point.

6342
02:42:12,750 --> 02:42:13,740
And so my,

6343
02:42:14,040 --> 02:42:19,020
my body had sort of developed with this
need for that exertion in order to have

6344
02:42:19,021 --> 02:42:19,854
clarity.

6345
02:42:20,310 --> 02:42:23,040
And so I just am like this is my formula.

6346
02:42:23,070 --> 02:42:24,780
I'm sticking with it so I never let it go.

6347
02:42:24,810 --> 02:42:29,460
It's amazing that you did stick that
you've never gone away from that.

6348
02:42:29,490 --> 02:42:30,323
I can't,

6349
02:42:31,170 --> 02:42:32,490
I won't think right.

6350
02:42:32,550 --> 02:42:33,510
I don't think right.

6351
02:42:33,540 --> 02:42:34,241
I think we,

6352
02:42:34,241 --> 02:42:37,320
I think so much better when I exercise.

6353
02:42:37,321 --> 02:42:38,460
I mean there's no comparison.

6354
02:42:38,461 --> 02:42:39,330
It's like a pill.

6355
02:42:39,450 --> 02:42:43,080
I did this a sober
October fitness challenge,

6356
02:42:43,081 --> 02:42:44,300
things with my friends uh,

6357
02:42:44,380 --> 02:42:45,930
in October and uh,

6358
02:42:45,931 --> 02:42:47,160
we went crazy.

6359
02:42:47,161 --> 02:42:49,680
We were working on like three hours a
day cause we were wearing these heart

6360
02:42:49,681 --> 02:42:50,251
monitors.

6361
02:42:50,251 --> 02:42:53,130
And one of the things that I wrecked
cause we were trying to like get a certain

6362
02:42:53,131 --> 02:42:54,950
score and whoever got
the highest score one,

6363
02:42:54,960 --> 02:42:58,350
one of the things that I recognize from
that was that the more I did in terms of

6364
02:42:58,351 --> 02:42:58,801
cardio,

6365
02:42:58,801 --> 02:42:59,900
especially the,

6366
02:43:00,090 --> 02:43:01,890
the last things bothered me,

6367
02:43:02,070 --> 02:43:03,810
the middle or more clarity I had,

6368
02:43:03,811 --> 02:43:05,040
the more peaceful I felt,

6369
02:43:05,041 --> 02:43:06,060
the more at ease.

6370
02:43:06,061 --> 02:43:07,530
I felt no more,

6371
02:43:07,531 --> 02:43:09,120
no one internal chatter.

6372
02:43:09,300 --> 02:43:10,133
You know,

6373
02:43:10,620 --> 02:43:11,201
I just think,

6374
02:43:11,201 --> 02:43:11,530
um,

6375
02:43:11,530 --> 02:43:12,100
for whatever

6376
02:43:12,100 --> 02:43:12,310
reason,

6377
02:43:12,310 --> 02:43:14,830
I mean everyone has their
own biological makeup.

6378
02:43:14,831 --> 02:43:15,664
And for me,

6379
02:43:16,030 --> 02:43:16,570
my boss,

6380
02:43:16,570 --> 02:43:21,150
my biological makeup is entirely dependent
on the health benefits from it as if

6381
02:43:21,270 --> 02:43:21,851
it's a giant.

6382
02:43:21,851 --> 02:43:22,510
But for me,

6383
02:43:22,510 --> 02:43:24,860
my mind actually choose.

6384
02:43:24,960 --> 02:43:25,560
Yeah.

6385
02:43:25,560 --> 02:43:25,820
You know,

6386
02:43:25,820 --> 02:43:28,210
a friend of mine said that
sitting is the new smoking.

6387
02:43:28,590 --> 02:43:28,740
Yeah.

6388
02:43:28,740 --> 02:43:29,510
I think we say that,

6389
02:43:29,510 --> 02:43:30,071
that does that.

6390
02:43:30,071 --> 02:43:31,930
Does that make it good for you?

6391
02:43:31,931 --> 02:43:32,970
It's a compression of your,

6392
02:43:33,020 --> 02:43:34,270
your disks for sure.

6393
02:43:34,570 --> 02:43:35,950
Especially your lower back.

6394
02:43:35,951 --> 02:43:37,360
And if you don't have good posture,

6395
02:43:37,361 --> 02:43:38,194
it's not good,

6396
02:43:38,440 --> 02:43:40,210
but you can mitigate it with exercise.

6397
02:43:40,270 --> 02:43:40,580
You know,

6398
02:43:40,580 --> 02:43:40,811
just,

6399
02:43:40,811 --> 02:43:42,460
you gotta make sure
that you don't only sit,

6400
02:43:43,420 --> 02:43:43,781
you know,

6401
02:43:43,781 --> 02:43:45,970
stretch yourself out
and take a yoga class.

6402
02:43:46,540 --> 02:43:47,530
I should be writing this down.

6403
02:43:47,650 --> 02:43:48,450
Seriously.

6404
02:43:48,450 --> 02:43:49,400
[inaudible] Oh,

6405
02:43:49,870 --> 02:43:51,070
do you do any exercising?

6406
02:43:51,160 --> 02:43:52,540
I'm starting more.

6407
02:43:52,541 --> 02:43:54,130
I found out if it's hilarious,

6408
02:43:54,131 --> 02:43:58,540
I would like to have kind of a
had a golf back injury type thing.

6409
02:43:58,560 --> 02:43:58,900
Coughs.

6410
02:43:58,900 --> 02:44:00,070
Like we swing that fucker.

6411
02:44:00,071 --> 02:44:00,491
This is a lot.

6412
02:44:00,491 --> 02:44:01,060
It's hard.

6413
02:44:01,060 --> 02:44:02,020
It's hard on your back.

6414
02:44:02,410 --> 02:44:02,981
So I go,

6415
02:44:02,981 --> 02:44:05,150
I go to the doctor and uh,

6416
02:44:05,600 --> 02:44:08,890
x rays me and I got freaking
scoliosis that I never knew.

6417
02:44:09,100 --> 02:44:09,551
Oh Wow.

6418
02:44:09,551 --> 02:44:10,420
All my life.

6419
02:44:10,890 --> 02:44:11,201
Oh,

6420
02:44:11,201 --> 02:44:14,620
one at the bottom of my spine
when I can do about that.

6421
02:44:15,010 --> 02:44:15,843
Laugh at me.

6422
02:44:17,950 --> 02:44:18,371
By the way,

6423
02:44:18,371 --> 02:44:20,720
I'm in there with my wife Jackie,

6424
02:44:20,740 --> 02:44:22,540
while while he brings in the x,

6425
02:44:23,050 --> 02:44:23,883
x rays,

6426
02:44:24,160 --> 02:44:25,330
puts them up on the thing and goes,

6427
02:44:25,390 --> 02:44:26,223
hey buddy,

6428
02:44:26,290 --> 02:44:27,850
you got scoliosis?

6429
02:44:27,910 --> 02:44:30,220
And she bursts out laughing.

6430
02:44:31,210 --> 02:44:34,840
Now everybody says that's
why you walk that way.

6431
02:44:35,380 --> 02:44:36,820
Oh my God.

6432
02:44:37,030 --> 02:44:37,700
For Real.

6433
02:44:37,700 --> 02:44:38,050
Oh,

6434
02:44:38,050 --> 02:44:39,070
that's hilarious.

6435
02:44:39,580 --> 02:44:43,750
Every school at some point had when the
one hot girl was scoliosis who had the

6436
02:44:43,850 --> 02:44:44,683
headgear.

6437
02:44:45,520 --> 02:44:46,353
Every school,

6438
02:44:47,950 --> 02:44:50,110
she didn't have the headgear
on and she's really hot.

6439
02:44:50,140 --> 02:44:51,760
They had to have headgear scoliosis.

6440
02:44:52,620 --> 02:44:54,670
They tried to straighten it
out and back then it had metal,

6441
02:44:55,090 --> 02:44:56,740
like metal rods

6442
02:44:58,750 --> 02:44:58,991
head.

6443
02:44:58,991 --> 02:44:59,290
Yeah,

6444
02:44:59,290 --> 02:45:00,640
I thought that was a broken neck.

6445
02:45:01,160 --> 02:45:01,961
Scoliosis.

6446
02:45:01,961 --> 02:45:02,561
That's a neck.

6447
02:45:02,561 --> 02:45:02,751
Hey,

6448
02:45:02,751 --> 02:45:05,700
I got a girl that had a whole chest thing,

6449
02:45:06,760 --> 02:45:10,120
big plastic that she had to wear
to keep it like spine street.

6450
02:45:10,170 --> 02:45:11,470
She didn't wear it for like
two years or something.

6451
02:45:11,480 --> 02:45:12,200
Didn't work.

6452
02:45:12,200 --> 02:45:12,941
I sure.

6453
02:45:12,941 --> 02:45:13,481
I guess I don't,

6454
02:45:13,481 --> 02:45:13,901
I mean shit,

6455
02:45:13,901 --> 02:45:14,770
he didn't stay in touch.

6456
02:45:15,370 --> 02:45:16,203
What do they do with it?

6457
02:45:16,880 --> 02:45:17,390
Uh,

6458
02:45:17,390 --> 02:45:22,390
I still the same thing and I had a
meeting with the specialist and he's like,

6459
02:45:22,721 --> 02:45:25,480
well I like operating on people.

6460
02:45:27,100 --> 02:45:27,640
I like,

6461
02:45:27,640 --> 02:45:28,473
that's what I do.

6462
02:45:29,210 --> 02:45:30,470
That's why I got into this.

6463
02:45:30,770 --> 02:45:32,770
I'm like cutting them when they're asleep,

6464
02:45:33,120 --> 02:45:33,641
but you know,

6465
02:45:33,641 --> 02:45:36,490
you could do some exercises and some uh,

6466
02:45:36,491 --> 02:45:36,971
you know,

6467
02:45:36,971 --> 02:45:39,160
physical therapy and
stuff to alleviate it.

6468
02:45:39,610 --> 02:45:42,400
And if it gets so bad down the road,

6469
02:45:43,030 --> 02:45:45,730
I could maybe help you out with some rods.

6470
02:45:46,090 --> 02:45:50,500
So there you went in there because
there was an initial issue I had,

6471
02:45:50,530 --> 02:45:52,510
I had like issues when I was young.

6472
02:45:52,511 --> 02:45:54,460
When I used to do like
track and field and stuff,

6473
02:45:54,461 --> 02:45:58,870
I would get like a pain in an area and
then it Kinda went away most of my life.

6474
02:45:58,900 --> 02:46:02,980
Then I started golfing and then they
go off more and more and then one day I

6475
02:46:02,981 --> 02:46:03,814
didn't warm up.

6476
02:46:04,190 --> 02:46:05,023
I did a,

6477
02:46:05,080 --> 02:46:07,990
I did a twist and it just freaking,

6478
02:46:08,900 --> 02:46:09,710
yeah,

6479
02:46:09,710 --> 02:46:13,250
and it was in a certain spot
and I went and it was like,

6480
02:46:13,251 --> 02:46:15,020
you've always had this condition,

6481
02:46:15,470 --> 02:46:17,540
but dose is a picture of Paul.

6482
02:46:17,570 --> 02:46:18,260
There you go.

6483
02:46:18,260 --> 02:46:18,651
I know.

6484
02:46:18,651 --> 02:46:19,650
I look terrible in that.

6485
02:46:20,630 --> 02:46:21,740
That's a strange look.

6486
02:46:21,741 --> 02:46:22,070
Wow,

6487
02:46:22,070 --> 02:46:22,790
that's hilarious.

6488
02:46:22,790 --> 02:46:24,350
That's like what's going on with his Dick.

6489
02:46:24,380 --> 02:46:26,510
That's like an like getting constricted.

6490
02:46:26,511 --> 02:46:26,691
It's like,

6491
02:46:26,691 --> 02:46:27,200
and that's,

6492
02:46:27,200 --> 02:46:29,930
that's something they'd
wear on in the group pants.

6493
02:46:29,950 --> 02:46:32,810
Maybe like just the costume from TLC.

6494
02:46:33,230 --> 02:46:34,063
We were born.

6495
02:46:34,240 --> 02:46:35,073
Yeah,

6496
02:46:35,500 --> 02:46:37,040
it is androgynous phase.

6497
02:46:37,270 --> 02:46:38,103
Yeah.

6498
02:46:38,150 --> 02:46:38,481
They said,

6499
02:46:38,481 --> 02:46:42,680
I just got to suck it up and exercise
and get a strong core and I should be

6500
02:46:42,681 --> 02:46:43,010
fine.

6501
02:46:43,010 --> 02:46:45,350
Take Yoga as I got to do that.

6502
02:46:45,480 --> 02:46:45,871
I love it.

6503
02:46:45,871 --> 02:46:46,050
That's,

6504
02:46:46,050 --> 02:46:48,560
I keep hearing for old
people all the time.

6505
02:46:49,130 --> 02:46:50,780
Did you just start it as an old person?

6506
02:46:51,060 --> 02:46:51,451
No,

6507
02:46:51,451 --> 02:46:55,500
I didn't do when I was younger and then
I didn't do it seriously until about

6508
02:46:55,501 --> 02:46:56,281
three,

6509
02:46:56,281 --> 02:46:57,300
four years ago.

6510
02:46:57,570 --> 02:47:00,620
Then it's do it and now we do it
because you always did martial arts and

6511
02:47:00,700 --> 02:47:03,660
obviously like yoga was for people that
just were too lazy for martial arts.

6512
02:47:03,690 --> 02:47:04,950
No yogas.

6513
02:47:04,980 --> 02:47:09,300
Yoga does some things that really enhance
martial arts in because the hot yoga

6514
02:47:09,301 --> 02:47:09,780
guy.

6515
02:47:09,780 --> 02:47:09,991
Yeah,

6516
02:47:09,991 --> 02:47:10,824
I like that stuff.

6517
02:47:11,160 --> 02:47:12,300
That seems like torture to me.

6518
02:47:12,360 --> 02:47:13,290
It is a little bit of torture,

6519
02:47:13,291 --> 02:47:16,140
but it's really good for you because your
body produces heat shock proteins that

6520
02:47:16,141 --> 02:47:17,700
are similar to when you go into a sauna.

6521
02:47:18,270 --> 02:47:20,190
It feel great when you come out
of there and you feel great,

6522
02:47:20,191 --> 02:47:21,870
but it's also really
good for inflammation.

6523
02:47:21,900 --> 02:47:24,360
Just the act of doing it in cell itself,

6524
02:47:24,390 --> 02:47:28,080
in the extreme heat like sauna would
be amazing for you to for that reason.

6525
02:47:28,110 --> 02:47:28,580
Yeah,

6526
02:47:28,580 --> 02:47:29,380
when heat shocked,

6527
02:47:29,380 --> 02:47:32,460
but there's a woman named Doctor Rhonda
Patrick That's a regular on the show.

6528
02:47:32,461 --> 02:47:34,320
I have her on all the
time and she's genius.

6529
02:47:34,560 --> 02:47:39,560
She's a huge believer in sauna and they
did a study and what was it like Sweden

6530
02:47:40,411 --> 02:47:45,411
or some shit where they took people
with a regular sauna use versus not.

6531
02:47:46,351 --> 02:47:50,520
And the regular sauna use had a 40%
decrease in all cause mortality.

6532
02:47:50,700 --> 02:47:51,481
Heart attack,

6533
02:47:51,481 --> 02:47:52,314
stroke,

6534
02:47:52,350 --> 02:47:53,183
cancer.

6535
02:47:53,250 --> 02:47:53,730
Yes.

6536
02:47:53,730 --> 02:47:54,450
Because you're,

6537
02:47:54,450 --> 02:47:58,050
when you're regular using it 20
minutes a day for four days a week,

6538
02:47:58,320 --> 02:48:01,830
what they're essentially saying is that
your body producing those heat shock

6539
02:48:01,831 --> 02:48:04,230
proteins and those sidechains
20 minutes of Yoga.

6540
02:48:04,231 --> 02:48:04,520
Yeah,

6541
02:48:04,520 --> 02:48:04,691
no,

6542
02:48:04,691 --> 02:48:04,760
no,

6543
02:48:04,760 --> 02:48:05,010
no,

6544
02:48:05,010 --> 02:48:05,290
no.

6545
02:48:05,290 --> 02:48:05,730
Heat,

6546
02:48:05,730 --> 02:48:06,300
heat,

6547
02:48:06,300 --> 02:48:06,670
sauna.

6548
02:48:06,670 --> 02:48:10,170
Just sitting in a sauna going on out here,

6549
02:48:10,380 --> 02:48:11,100
sit in the Sauna,

6550
02:48:11,100 --> 02:48:16,100
20 minutes that just doing that is a fee
because almost all ailments and issues

6551
02:48:17,540 --> 02:48:18,560
and deal with inflammation.

6552
02:48:18,600 --> 02:48:18,870
Right.

6553
02:48:18,870 --> 02:48:19,380
Yeah.

6554
02:48:19,380 --> 02:48:19,771
Well I,

6555
02:48:19,771 --> 02:48:20,150
that's,

6556
02:48:20,150 --> 02:48:20,560
I,

6557
02:48:20,560 --> 02:48:25,560
I have to pinch nerves right now
and like herniated discs and uh,

6558
02:48:27,660 --> 02:48:28,530
and they were like,

6559
02:48:28,531 --> 02:48:29,190
I was like,

6560
02:48:29,190 --> 02:48:30,960
like on the couch for like two months.

6561
02:48:30,961 --> 02:48:32,010
Couldn't sell it from your injury?

6562
02:48:32,300 --> 02:48:32,670
Uh,

6563
02:48:32,670 --> 02:48:33,360
no I don't.

6564
02:48:33,360 --> 02:48:34,350
I don't think it was,

6565
02:48:34,380 --> 02:48:35,101
I don't know what it was from,

6566
02:48:35,101 --> 02:48:35,741
but it was a,

6567
02:48:35,741 --> 02:48:36,391
it may have been,

6568
02:48:36,391 --> 02:48:36,811
it may have been,

6569
02:48:36,811 --> 02:48:37,330
but it was,

6570
02:48:37,330 --> 02:48:38,130
uh,

6571
02:48:38,130 --> 02:48:39,720
like one day it just started my arm,

6572
02:48:39,750 --> 02:48:42,810
my arm started hurting and pin
pointing towards your neck.

6573
02:48:43,080 --> 02:48:43,291
Yeah.

6574
02:48:43,291 --> 02:48:44,430
It's like somewhere in here,

6575
02:48:44,450 --> 02:48:45,283
the herniated disc.

6576
02:48:45,400 --> 02:48:46,233
That makes sense.

6577
02:48:47,670 --> 02:48:48,770
Is your lower right?

6578
02:48:49,140 --> 02:48:49,770
Yeah.

6579
02:48:49,770 --> 02:48:49,951
Yeah.

6580
02:48:49,951 --> 02:48:50,820
That's your lower back.

6581
02:48:50,821 --> 02:48:51,654
But the uh,

6582
02:48:52,090 --> 02:48:52,510
yeah,

6583
02:48:52,510 --> 02:48:53,281
I like from my arm,

6584
02:48:53,281 --> 02:48:53,910
her two months,

6585
02:48:53,910 --> 02:48:54,450
my arm,

6586
02:48:54,450 --> 02:48:54,931
my arm,

6587
02:48:54,931 --> 02:48:57,390
my arm felt like it was going to explode.

6588
02:48:57,970 --> 02:49:00,630
It felt like there was this
pressure building up in it
and it was literally like

6589
02:49:00,631 --> 02:49:00,860
Blake,

6590
02:49:00,860 --> 02:49:04,880
he was going to explode
and I was getting like a,

6591
02:49:05,240 --> 02:49:05,760
what do they call,

6592
02:49:05,760 --> 02:49:06,250
uh,

6593
02:49:06,250 --> 02:49:07,980
the kind of the shots you get when

6594
02:49:07,990 --> 02:49:09,650
you're having an epidural.

6595
02:49:09,660 --> 02:49:11,670
I was getting epidural shots
that were doing nothing.

6596
02:49:11,671 --> 02:49:13,410
I was taking 16 Advil a day.

6597
02:49:13,440 --> 02:49:13,930
Jesus,

6598
02:49:13,930 --> 02:49:14,763
Jesus,

6599
02:49:15,580 --> 02:49:16,413
take that.

6600
02:49:16,570 --> 02:49:18,390
And I was getting no pain relief.

6601
02:49:19,770 --> 02:49:22,020
And then I started using CBD.

6602
02:49:22,290 --> 02:49:23,670
Ah,

6603
02:49:23,730 --> 02:49:25,320
and like that,

6604
02:49:25,321 --> 02:49:26,154
it was gone.

6605
02:49:26,340 --> 02:49:27,120
Amazing.

6606
02:49:27,120 --> 02:49:27,953
And even now it's like,

6607
02:49:27,970 --> 02:49:28,230
you know,

6608
02:49:28,230 --> 02:49:28,621
I couldn't,

6609
02:49:28,621 --> 02:49:30,720
I couldn't do anything
for two solid months.

6610
02:49:30,721 --> 02:49:31,740
I couldn't get off the couch.

6611
02:49:31,760 --> 02:49:33,030
CVD is incredible.

6612
02:49:33,150 --> 02:49:33,630
Yeah,

6613
02:49:33,630 --> 02:49:36,090
I use that stuff so much
that I got the rubbing stuff.

6614
02:49:36,091 --> 02:49:36,770
That's great too.

6615
02:49:36,770 --> 02:49:39,030
It makes it better for about two days.

6616
02:49:39,031 --> 02:49:40,220
My friend Hahn's though,

6617
02:49:40,370 --> 02:49:42,420
he told me he has a shortage,

6618
02:49:42,450 --> 02:49:46,230
recent shoulder surgery and he said
everybody likes to use the rub stuff,

6619
02:49:46,231 --> 02:49:49,320
but you really should take it
with the edible stuff like oil,

6620
02:49:49,321 --> 02:49:52,320
oral CBD and rub stuff works together.

6621
02:49:52,350 --> 02:49:52,910
Smoking.

6622
02:49:52,910 --> 02:49:53,430
I started,

6623
02:49:53,430 --> 02:49:54,570
I had the cream.

6624
02:49:54,610 --> 02:49:54,760
No,

6625
02:49:54,760 --> 02:49:56,000
just pop a pill.

6626
02:49:56,220 --> 02:49:59,070
I seem seen green that I've rubbed and
then I started using the tincture with

6627
02:49:59,071 --> 02:49:59,550
it.

6628
02:49:59,550 --> 02:50:00,151
We have some here.

6629
02:50:00,151 --> 02:50:05,151
If you want some case in the back that
that case is given to us by a stay.

6630
02:50:06,300 --> 02:50:06,900
He'd we'd,

6631
02:50:06,900 --> 02:50:07,051
yeah,

6632
02:50:07,051 --> 02:50:10,460
the big chest chest of marijuana.

6633
02:50:10,560 --> 02:50:11,250
That's a lot of,

6634
02:50:11,250 --> 02:50:12,270
it's crazy and here's the thing.

6635
02:50:12,280 --> 02:50:15,600
Turn lights on and off tincture
along with the the cream.

6636
02:50:15,650 --> 02:50:15,900
Yes.

6637
02:50:15,900 --> 02:50:16,381
Perfect.

6638
02:50:16,381 --> 02:50:17,610
My arthritis went away too.

6639
02:50:18,120 --> 02:50:18,510
Yeah.

6640
02:50:18,510 --> 02:50:21,230
I had like this finger stuff meant,

6641
02:50:21,290 --> 02:50:21,441
yeah,

6642
02:50:21,441 --> 02:50:21,751
I could,

6643
02:50:21,751 --> 02:50:24,960
I couldn't bend my hand
and it's like that's gone.

6644
02:50:25,160 --> 02:50:25,800
Automation.

6645
02:50:25,800 --> 02:50:25,951
Yeah.

6646
02:50:25,951 --> 02:50:26,420
The knee.

6647
02:50:26,420 --> 02:50:28,540
My arthritis in my knees completely gone.

6648
02:50:28,800 --> 02:50:30,900
It'll go away even further
if we cut out sugar.

6649
02:50:31,430 --> 02:50:32,090
Yeah,

6650
02:50:32,090 --> 02:50:33,240
that sugar and bread.

6651
02:50:33,450 --> 02:50:34,920
I did that and I felt fantastic.

6652
02:50:34,940 --> 02:50:36,450
That's the sugar was gone crazy.

6653
02:50:36,451 --> 02:50:37,284
Right.

6654
02:50:37,460 --> 02:50:38,850
Pours in ourselves our whole lives.

6655
02:50:38,910 --> 02:50:39,241
That's a,

6656
02:50:39,241 --> 02:50:40,700
that is a poison sugar.

6657
02:50:40,710 --> 02:50:40,931
Yeah,

6658
02:50:40,931 --> 02:50:41,610
absolutely.

6659
02:50:41,610 --> 02:50:42,930
That's the one thing when I quit drinking,

6660
02:50:42,931 --> 02:50:43,890
I wanted more sugar.

6661
02:50:44,460 --> 02:50:44,621
Oh,

6662
02:50:44,621 --> 02:50:45,720
he has one effect because I,

6663
02:50:45,721 --> 02:50:47,160
I've never had a sweet tooth really,

6664
02:50:47,161 --> 02:50:47,640
but one the,

6665
02:50:47,640 --> 02:50:48,331
when I quit drinking,

6666
02:50:48,331 --> 02:50:50,400
I suddenly was craving that chocolate.

6667
02:50:50,460 --> 02:50:52,140
Of course it makes sense.

6668
02:50:52,440 --> 02:50:53,910
I should go back to zero sugar.

6669
02:50:53,911 --> 02:50:56,190
I went zero sugar for a
while and it felt amazing.

6670
02:50:56,191 --> 02:50:57,990
I'm just like a little
tiny bits here and there.

6671
02:50:58,260 --> 02:50:59,093
Do you do zero?

6672
02:50:59,160 --> 02:50:59,940
I do.

6673
02:50:59,940 --> 02:51:03,990
I had dessert Saturday night and had a
big old cake with ice cream on it after

6674
02:51:03,991 --> 02:51:04,824
dinner.

6675
02:51:05,700 --> 02:51:10,700
So no checker when a date with the wife
at Mastro's we have this big fat steak

6676
02:51:11,011 --> 02:51:14,310
and then I got this butter cake with
it sounds like ice cream and oh,

6677
02:51:14,311 --> 02:51:14,911
it was delicious.

6678
02:51:14,911 --> 02:51:15,450
That was great.

6679
02:51:15,450 --> 02:51:16,283
So good.

6680
02:51:16,860 --> 02:51:17,693
So good.

6681
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:18,690
So good.

6682
02:51:18,690 --> 02:51:19,620
That sounds amazing.

6683
02:51:19,950 --> 02:51:20,760
I say no to that.

6684
02:51:20,760 --> 02:51:21,593
That sounds amazing.

6685
02:51:21,600 --> 02:51:23,220
And occasionally you got to say fuck it,

6686
02:51:24,430 --> 02:51:25,350
but I just,

6687
02:51:25,650 --> 02:51:26,580
for the most part,

6688
02:51:26,880 --> 02:51:28,470
I'm on like an 80 20 diet.

6689
02:51:28,530 --> 02:51:30,360
80% of it is super healthy.

6690
02:51:30,660 --> 02:51:32,910
And then the 20% is
occasionally I'm on Goff.

6691
02:51:32,950 --> 02:51:33,600
Yeah.

6692
02:51:33,600 --> 02:51:33,970
Yeah,

6693
02:51:33,970 --> 02:51:34,800
I've seen that.

6694
02:51:34,800 --> 02:51:35,131
That,

6695
02:51:35,131 --> 02:51:35,820
uh,

6696
02:51:35,820 --> 02:51:36,360
two,

6697
02:51:36,360 --> 02:51:38,220
two and five fasting

6698
02:51:39,720 --> 02:51:40,321
two days a week.

6699
02:51:40,321 --> 02:51:43,380
You do like 600 calories
the rest of the week.

6700
02:51:43,381 --> 02:51:44,340
You can do whatever you want.

6701
02:51:44,370 --> 02:51:47,820
I'm on the seven and zero seven pig out.

6702
02:51:48,610 --> 02:51:49,500
I do,

6703
02:51:49,501 --> 02:51:50,220
um,

6704
02:51:50,220 --> 02:51:50,730
uh,

6705
02:51:50,730 --> 02:51:51,780
intermittent fasting.

6706
02:51:51,870 --> 02:51:53,410
So every night if I,

6707
02:51:53,411 --> 02:51:53,730
you know,

6708
02:51:53,730 --> 02:51:55,800
have dinner at 7:00 PM,

6709
02:51:56,100 --> 02:51:56,401
you know,

6710
02:51:56,401 --> 02:51:58,230
I don't eat anything for 16 hours.

6711
02:51:58,450 --> 02:51:59,710
I didn't want to hear at Passover.

6712
02:52:00,220 --> 02:52:01,053
Yeah.

6713
02:52:02,030 --> 02:52:02,860
Sorry.

6714
02:52:02,860 --> 02:52:03,230
That was me.

6715
02:52:03,230 --> 02:52:05,740
I found like my cholesterol just
dropped through the floor and then,

6716
02:52:05,770 --> 02:52:06,100
yeah,

6717
02:52:06,100 --> 02:52:06,520
when I,

6718
02:52:06,520 --> 02:52:07,210
when I did that.

6719
02:52:07,210 --> 02:52:08,380
But I haven't been doing it lately.

6720
02:52:08,980 --> 02:52:09,813
Yeah.

6721
02:52:09,820 --> 02:52:11,410
No Boys,

6722
02:52:11,411 --> 02:52:12,280
we just did three hours.

6723
02:52:12,400 --> 02:52:13,210
Oh my God.

6724
02:52:13,210 --> 02:52:14,170
Can we do this more often?

6725
02:52:14,270 --> 02:52:16,660
That's really our only our second podcast.

6726
02:52:17,050 --> 02:52:17,711
Believe it or not.

6727
02:52:17,711 --> 02:52:18,290
It's crazy.

6728
02:52:18,290 --> 02:52:19,900
Yet I'm in much better shape this time.

6729
02:52:19,930 --> 02:52:20,470
Yeah.

6730
02:52:20,470 --> 02:52:21,010
Great man.

6731
02:52:21,010 --> 02:52:21,843
Everything's wonderful.

6732
02:52:22,100 --> 02:52:22,933
Um,

6733
02:52:23,080 --> 02:52:24,850
tell people the name of your podcast,

6734
02:52:24,851 --> 02:52:26,590
Ian read says,

6735
02:52:26,860 --> 02:52:29,560
don't say with Paul and Dave.

6736
02:52:29,770 --> 02:52:30,130
Yes.

6737
02:52:30,130 --> 02:52:30,821
But once you get there,

6738
02:52:30,821 --> 02:52:31,654
be warned.

6739
02:52:31,810 --> 02:52:33,910
Don't say cut the following day,

6740
02:52:34,330 --> 02:52:35,590
but we can't put that in print.

6741
02:52:35,830 --> 02:52:36,490
Um,

6742

you can just do,

6761
02:52:59,040 --> 02:53:03,250
you can just do a web search on your own
and maybe not have everything spoon fed

6762
02:53:03,251 --> 02:53:03,660
to you.

6763
02:53:03,660 --> 02:53:04,170
Yes.

All right.

Thank you guys.
