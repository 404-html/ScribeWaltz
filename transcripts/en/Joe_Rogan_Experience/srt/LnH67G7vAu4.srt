1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:04,913
I tried to explain to my low that you 
can't wear sunglasses indoors unless 

2
00:00:07,861 --> 00:00:10,230
you're black.
And he put them right back on.

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,410
You almost took them off,
but you put them back on in spite.

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,041
Well,
I said,

5
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:16,020
I've got plenty of black gay man.
You should mind your own business.

6
00:00:16,021 --> 00:00:20,780
You have had plenty of very difficult,
very difficult,

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,290
especially with that jacket on.
Oh,

8
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:23,610
you like it.
It's adorable.

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,960
Thank you.
I don't know.

10
00:00:24,961 --> 00:00:26,010
I like to,
like I said,

11
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,440
military it up a little bit.
Sometimes you want me to take them off?

12
00:00:28,441 --> 00:00:29,274
You do that.
Please explain to the people listening 

13
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:33,450
what exactly this jacket is because some
folks are not watching.

14
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:35,850
Obviously I've lots of friends in the 
military.

15
00:00:35,851 --> 00:00:38,220
It's the best I'm forces in the world.
Merck should be very happy about it.

16
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,450
Um,
it's occasionally,

17
00:00:39,451 --> 00:00:40,284
you know,
he wandered into the commissary and 

18
00:00:40,771 --> 00:00:41,191
just,
you know,

19
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:45,060
pick up a few little few little items 
and adjusted of course,

20
00:00:45,061 --> 00:00:45,894
because,
you know,

21
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,660
she's tufts very boxy,
very boxy.

22
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,700
So I took it to a nice Taylor in,
um,

23
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,380
in Beverly Hills,
you know,

24
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,530
had the,
had the sleeves pulled down.

25
00:00:52,531 --> 00:00:53,364
It's very nice.
It's like some sort of a navy jacket or 

26
00:00:55,141 --> 00:00:56,500
something.
Like what is that exactly?

27
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,250
It's an army dress jacket actually.
But this was an air force place.

28
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,580
Is that a military appropriation and 
you're allowed to,

29
00:01:02,581 --> 00:01:04,890
is that the stolen valor?
Are you allowed to other no,

30
00:01:04,891 --> 00:01:05,191
no,
no,

31
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:06,360
no.
It's any stolen valor.

32
00:01:06,361 --> 00:01:09,120
If you're like misrepresenting their,
remember though I forces and you know,

33
00:01:09,121 --> 00:01:12,090
if I had like batches on or something,
then that would be bad.

34
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,840
I like to think of this more of a,
as a source of fashionable amash.

35
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,780
It's a respectful gesture.
Ah,

36
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,800
Nice.
Yeah.

37
00:01:19,801 --> 00:01:22,950
Those stolen valor dudes are very odd 
when they get caught.

38
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,073
We've seen a lot of those videos.
That's a disturbing little mental 

39
00:01:26,761 --> 00:01:29,340
illness to pretend to be a war hero.

40
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,660
It is.
And you know what's interesting,

41
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,450
they always get caught out because 
they're sort of very clever but not very

42
00:01:33,451 --> 00:01:34,284
clever.
So what they'll do is they will think 

43
00:01:36,241 --> 00:01:38,040
that they've got all the badges right 
and they'll kind of like,

44
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:38,903
they'll have a friend who sort of lets 
them into the commissary so they can go 

45
00:01:40,771 --> 00:01:41,700
and pick up these badges.
Like,

46
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:43,290
pretend that part of the tank unit or 
whatever,

47
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,480
and they'll,
but they'll get something slightly wrong

48
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:48,870
because they're not serving and they 
don't have a superior officer.

49
00:01:48,871 --> 00:01:49,490
It'd be like,
that's,

50
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:49,921
you know,
you know,

51
00:01:49,921 --> 00:01:50,754
they're just,
they're just getting the middle of 

52
00:01:50,941 --> 00:01:52,560
something wrong.
And of course,

53
00:01:52,561 --> 00:01:56,790
for all of their weird autistic 
obsessions about the,

54
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,750
uh,
getting,

55
00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:59,700
getting all of the uniform stuff 
perfect.

56
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:00,803
There are people out there on the 
Internet who are vets who know the 

57
00:02:02,191 --> 00:02:04,590
difference.
And so they were these amazing wars.

58
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,940
There's a,
there's a name for them in Britain.

59
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,940
We called them waltz.
Like Walter Mitty is,

60
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,620
who's Walter Mitty.
Uh,

61
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:12,540
Walter Mitty is,
I know that name.

62
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,433
Yeah.
It was the most recently there was a 

63
00:02:14,731 --> 00:02:15,600
movie,
I think it was,

64
00:02:15,601 --> 00:02:17,580
was it Matt Damon?
Um,

65
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,241
yeah.
Anyway,

66
00:02:18,241 --> 00:02:18,721
it's,
it's a,

67
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:19,290
it's,
there's just,

68
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:19,940
it's,
it's,

69
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,830
it's become,
it's a novel on a novel and a movie in,

70
00:02:22,831 --> 00:02:25,710
it's become just a name in culture for 
people who pretend to be somebody else.

71
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,690
The secret life of Walter Mitty.
Oh,

72
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:28,890
that's right.
Yeah.

73
00:02:28,891 --> 00:02:31,290
So in the army,
they call them walt's people who pretend

74
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,153
to be vets or pretending to be sort of 
service officer serving personnel who 

75
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,850
are not is a very bizarre mental 
illness.

76
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,440
Eds.
It is.

77
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,303
Yeah.
It's so uncomfortable watching them get 

78
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:43,330
called out to,
oh,

79
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,163
there was one guy that I love it.
These marines cornered them and they 

80
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:50,150
started asking him questions and start 
falling apart.

81
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,023
Like,
Woo.

82
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:51,990
Yeah,
no,

83
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,000
it's so awkward and clingy,
but I live for those moments in life.

84
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,620
They are fun.
If,

85
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,980
so speaking of awkward and Cringey,

86
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,480
what the fuck is going on with your 
country,

87
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:02,920
man?
Well,

88
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:06,160
I'm so happy for the first time.
No,

89
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:06,994
I've never,
I mean,

90
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,820
you know,
Michelle Obama said something terrible.

91
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,663
She's like,
I was proud of my country the first for 

92
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,610
the first time or something like that.
You know,

93
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:15,280
about something trivial and ridiculous,
which I found distressing.

94
00:03:15,281 --> 00:03:16,990
And I don't want to say that because 
it's not true,

95
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,700
but I did suddenly think there might be 
hope for your,

96
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:21,850
after all,
there might be hope,

97
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:23,350
particularly for the best country in 
Europe,

98
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,500
which is England,
uh,

99
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,120
and the best sort of nation in Europe,
you know,

100
00:03:26,121 --> 00:03:30,400
the United Kingdom finally unshackled 
from this hellish,

101
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,273
um,
this hellish continent on a suicide 

102
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:37,630
mission into is the migration and a 
economic doom.

103
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,703
Finally,
the UK has got a chance to prove that 

104
00:03:39,631 --> 00:03:41,620
it's better than all that and it can 
reopen,

105
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:44,050
you know,
better trade relationships with Asia,

106
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,330
with India,
with America can re,

107
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,110
you know,
reassess,

108
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:49,390
renegotiate its relationship with all 
the countries around it.

109
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,583
The European project for me,
I mean I know a lot of Americans have 

110
00:03:52,571 --> 00:03:54,610
sort of believed what they've read about
the coverage,

111
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,150
you know,
from,

112
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:58,300
from the media on this.
But I'm definitely in the Brexit camp.

113
00:03:58,301 --> 00:04:00,610
I think it's fantastic and not just 
economically,

114
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,833
um,
cause I think things will bounce back 

115
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,210
and Britain will be better than ever,
but,

116
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,490
but culturally and it's readable.
It's what's so essential.

117
00:04:06,491 --> 00:04:08,440
Britain has a slightly different 
national characters.

118
00:04:08,441 --> 00:04:09,880
The rest of you,
it's never really fit.

119
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:11,343
And I think Britain now has an 
opportunity to save itself from the 

120
00:04:14,891 --> 00:04:15,724
suicidal open borders policies of Angela
Merkel from the inevitable decline and 

121
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:24,430
fall of Europe is a continent.
Generally Britain's got a chance now and

122
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,690
it didn't have a chance as part of 
Europe.

123
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,550
And Merkel is the one who when those 
attacks were going on in Germany during,

124
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,110
uh,
New Year's Eve,

125
00:04:32,111 --> 00:04:34,900
where the Islamic guys are grabbing all 
those girls,

126
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:35,763
her advice was for them to dress 
differently than stay within arm's 

127
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,750
length.

128
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,093
I mean,
in feminism we call this victim blaming 

129
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,223
when you tell people that they did 
something that contributed toward their 

130
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:47,110
rape.
Uh,

131
00:04:47,111 --> 00:04:50,500
but of course in the hierarchy of 
oppression and victim hood,

132
00:04:50,501 --> 00:04:53,200
according to progressive's,
Muslims rank higher than women.

133
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:54,850
Muslims rank higher than anybody else.
In fact,

134
00:04:54,851 --> 00:04:55,810
nobody knows why.
Well,

135
00:04:55,811 --> 00:04:57,400
it's because of the wars.
Well,

136
00:04:57,401 --> 00:04:58,234
it's definitely right.
It's because they hate the west as much 

137
00:04:59,681 --> 00:05:00,514
as feminists too.
And so you think it has something to do 

138
00:05:02,411 --> 00:05:05,530
with the fact that we invaded Iraq and 
Afghanistan and people feel a little bit

139
00:05:05,531 --> 00:05:07,510
guilty about the fact that a million 
people have died?

140
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,373
Well,
white guilt has driven all of the worst 

141
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,370
things that have happened in Weston.
Oh,

142
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:13,204
all of them.
All the worst things that have happened 

143
00:05:14,021 --> 00:05:16,480
in western culture in the last 30 years 
have all been driven by white guilt,

144
00:05:16,481 --> 00:05:18,190
feminism,
black lives matter the whole lot.

145
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,121
Uh,
you know,

146
00:05:19,121 --> 00:05:20,680
these,
these are not good reasons.

147
00:05:20,681 --> 00:05:23,620
Feminism is driven by white guilt.
Of course.

148
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,060
Look,
I've a theory about this.

149
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,750
It's very straight forward.
In the nineties we had Marilyn Manson,

150
00:05:28,751 --> 00:05:32,710
we had Trent Reznor,
we had a nirvana and people were cutting

151
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:33,730
themselves.
You know,

152
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,581
there was a,
there was a,

153
00:05:34,581 --> 00:05:36,190
the emo thing,
and when I was growing,

154
00:05:36,191 --> 00:05:38,200
I mean I didn't obviously,
but when people were growing up,

155
00:05:38,201 --> 00:05:41,120
they had an outlet for all of that sort 
of repressed rage and self loathing.

156
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,730
Well,
kids these days don't have that.

157
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,370
And the inevitable result of social 
justice.

158
00:05:45,371 --> 00:05:48,520
What they do instead is they sort of 
hang on to this as a protracted self.

159
00:05:48,521 --> 00:05:50,080
Hatred is protracted,
self harm,

160
00:05:50,081 --> 00:05:50,914
social justice.
They go out into the world and hurt 

161
00:05:52,571 --> 00:05:55,000
people who look like them.
So these awful,

162
00:05:55,001 --> 00:05:55,834
you know,
middle class white feminist women just 

163
00:05:57,111 --> 00:05:57,980
want to hurt other

164
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,630
middle class white people because they 
feel like,

165
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:00,770
you know,
the world is terrible.

166
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,600
Uh,
you know,

167
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,433
it's a very weird phenomenon,
this social justice thing and I think 

168
00:06:04,971 --> 00:06:07,880
it's mainly driven by self loathing and 
um,

169
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,300
once you understand that their behavior 
becomes a lot more,

170
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,010
it makes a lot more sense.
You know,

171
00:06:13,011 --> 00:06:15,230
you start to understand why they are as 
they are.

172
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,960
I think a lot of heat is definitely and 
self-loathing and it,

173
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:19,843
there's,
there's an opportunity today that they 

174
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:22,034
have that they never had before to 
organize and find likeminded folks and 

175
00:06:25,131 --> 00:06:27,320
get together and form of the crazy 
people,

176
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:28,460
fully gangs.
Yes,

177
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:30,440
they all do it again,
but they bully gangs and you know you,

178
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,900
when you start to understand that this 
is a sort of psychosis,

179
00:06:32,901 --> 00:06:35,450
when you start to understand this is a 
sort of like mental illness,

180
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,343
this is something that they should have 
got out of the systems when they were 

181
00:06:37,491 --> 00:06:38,324
teens,
but they didn't because they had no 

182
00:06:39,261 --> 00:06:40,040
culture to help them.

183
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,460
They know I grew up on Marilyn Manson 
and Nirvana.

184
00:06:43,461 --> 00:06:44,294
These kids grow up on like Selena Gomez 
and Justin Bieber and that sort of like 

185
00:06:46,671 --> 00:06:50,540
flat anodyne eternally fundless grinning
garbage.

186
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,613
They don't ever get it out of their 
systems and now you have 35 year old 

187
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,320
bitter bastards working for buzzfeed.
You still,

188
00:06:57,321 --> 00:06:59,420
it's got to go somewhere and where does 
it go?

189
00:06:59,421 --> 00:07:01,730
It goes into social justice and this is 
what's happened.

190
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,820
Don't you think that there's a 
percentage of them?

191
00:07:04,821 --> 00:07:05,654
Some of them genuinely feel like this is
a unique opportunity to write some of 

192
00:07:09,111 --> 00:07:12,800
the wrongs,
that our culture is sort of encouraged.

193
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,920
What is our culture or intimate sexism,
racism.

194
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,400
Nobody says there's no sexism and no 
racism in this,

195
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,470
in this country either.
Even in this country.

196
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,513
No serious person says that.
Nobody really believes that I'm 

197
00:07:27,951 --> 00:07:29,510
squeaking in my chair.
That wasn't anything else.

198
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,210
Nobody really believes that.

199
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,590
Nobody,
nobody says it.

200
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,840
Look,
we live in,

201
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,730
you know where you live.
I'm hoping that if at one day,

202
00:07:37,731 --> 00:07:40,250
but you know you live in the greatest 
country in the world.

203
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,800
It is a country driven by democracy,
freedom,

204
00:07:42,801 --> 00:07:43,634
property rights,
capitalism and all of those western 

205
00:07:45,651 --> 00:07:46,850
values.
The values on which,

206
00:07:46,851 --> 00:07:47,684
you know,
freedom of speech and the second 

207
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:49,334
amendment to all of those things that 
went into building America and making 

208
00:07:51,621 --> 00:07:52,454
America wonderful are exactly the same 
things that are responsible for women 

209
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,250
having the vote,
having access to the same opportunity,

210
00:07:58,251 --> 00:08:00,110
the same opportunity,
the same access to institutions,

211
00:08:00,111 --> 00:08:01,100
to education,
to the workplace,

212
00:08:01,101 --> 00:08:02,660
having equal pay,
which of course they do.

213
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,713
You know it giving gay people rights.
Look at the places in the world where 

214
00:08:06,171 --> 00:08:07,670
gay people have rights.
They are modern,

215
00:08:07,671 --> 00:08:11,000
western liberal capitalist,
capitalist democracies or the left hates

216
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,750
all of those things and hates the West 
for precisely that,

217
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:14,603
you know,
for size of the reasons that the West 

218
00:08:15,111 --> 00:08:16,220
has been nice to them.

219
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,233
You know,
and frankly they don't go after this 

220
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,420
assist hat,
white patriarchy.

221
00:08:20,421 --> 00:08:21,254
Well the patriarchy,
you know the western capitalist 

222
00:08:22,551 --> 00:08:24,950
Patriarchy is the only people that like 
you,

223
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:28,040
the only people who like the gaze,
the only people who like,

224
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,030
you know,
blacks and women,

225
00:08:29,031 --> 00:08:29,864
all the rest of it go anywhere else in 
the world and it is not a particularly 

226
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,283
pretty situation,
not a particularly happy place to be if 

227
00:08:35,451 --> 00:08:38,600
you're not born into the right group.
If you're in America,

228
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,640
you can pretty much do say and be 
whatever you want.

229
00:08:40,641 --> 00:08:41,720
Now,
there are threats to that and I,

230
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,500
my college tourist is hoping to sort of 
head off some of those,

231
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,990
those threats brewing in American 
universities,

232
00:08:47,991 --> 00:08:49,820
but these,
what are these people really hating on?

233
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,950
They live in the best country,
the most equal country,

234
00:08:51,951 --> 00:08:54,350
the greatest country,
the country with the most liberal values

235
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,240
anywhere on the planet and they're still
not happy.

236
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,320
We'll fine.
That's okay.

237
00:08:58,321 --> 00:09:00,600
There are obviously things left to fix.
No one's saying there's no sexism,

238
00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:03,630
no racism.
But why are they so silent when they see

239
00:09:03,631 --> 00:09:08,190
these horrific things happen elsewhere 
in the world end when I'm left wing,

240
00:09:08,191 --> 00:09:09,024
politicians decide they want to bring 
those horrific things into our 

241
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:13,080
countries.
You're Justin Trudeau wants to bring all

242
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:14,190
of these,
you know Syrian,

243
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,290
they're not refugees.
Of course they're migrants.

244
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,570
You know Angela Merkel in Germany,
you're talking about moment ago.

245
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,350
She,
you know,

246
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,230
opened the borders.
Are there 2 million Syrians in Germany?

247
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,300
Nobody really knows.
We know it's at least 1.21

248
00:09:24,301 --> 00:09:29,301
point 4 million fundamentally altering 
the fabric of Germany and importing with

249
00:09:29,401 --> 00:09:30,330
it,
bringing him with it.

250
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,300
Did we have a crash?
Are we still recording audio?

251
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,860
Okay,
what happens?

252
00:09:34,861 --> 00:09:37,440
We're just going to reboot.
So if you're watching this on youtube,

253
00:09:37,441 --> 00:09:40,590
you're not watching this,
you're not seeing anything.

254
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,780
You're not seeing anything from Ed map.
People are right now.

255
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,580
Do you know what it is?
Cause really minded folks.

256
00:09:44,581 --> 00:09:48,990
Cause we said feminism and Islam and 
Merkel on together,

257
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,990
they came in European Union,
they came in,

258
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:54,000
they sat in union,
they sent a bomb through the pipes.

259
00:09:54,001 --> 00:09:56,140
We've got,
we've got the stuxnet is in,

260
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,060
is in here.
Yeah.

261
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:57,963
I mean I don't think anybody is saying 
that there's no racism and no one's 

262
00:10:01,081 --> 00:10:02,940
saying there's no sex and we agree on 
that.

263
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,740
But don't you think that the,
the,

264
00:10:04,741 --> 00:10:06,180
the,
some that there is,

265
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,940
should be combated in some sort of a way
we'll show,

266
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,370
but that's takes,
takes care of itself pretty much.

267
00:10:11,371 --> 00:10:12,204
I mean that when was the last time 
somebody said it's like a genuinely 

268
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:18,360
sexist are genuinely racist remark in a 
friend group you were out and say in the

269
00:10:18,361 --> 00:10:20,490
bar with and didn't get corrected by 
people?

270
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,830
Well,
my friends who would all be joking,

271
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,890
but a lot of everybody,
I mean how many,

272
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,740
how many white supremacists to do you 
really think,

273
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:29,603
oh,
in America compared to black 

274
00:10:30,061 --> 00:10:33,810
supremacist,
how many genuinely misogynistic women,

275
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,673
women hating men?
Do you think there are in America 

276
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:39,270
compared to the women,
the young women that third wave feminism

277
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:41,880
has bread or the third wave feminism 
though is organized,

278
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:45,690
whereas the misogynist men,
most of the time they're isolated living

279
00:10:45,691 --> 00:10:46,524
in cabins in the woods and shit.
We have to speculate because we never 

280
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:50,970
meet any because we don't know any,
I don't know any,

281
00:10:50,971 --> 00:10:51,804
I've never met one,
but I've met plenty of man hating 

282
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:58,650
lesbian monsters who would be perfectly 
happy to see men rounded up in camps.

283
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,290
I've never met her real misogynist.
And I,

284
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,060
and I try.
I try.

285
00:11:03,061 --> 00:11:04,320
I try,
but I mean,

286
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,590
wouldn't they be my fans if they 
existed?

287
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,430
I mean,
you know,

288
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:09,930
I'm always being accused of providing 
cover for these people,

289
00:11:09,931 --> 00:11:12,180
but I've never found any,
well,

290
00:11:12,181 --> 00:11:13,790
that doesn't mean they're not there.
I mean,

291
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:18,830
you're dealing with people.
What about the people that murder women?

292
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,790
I mean those are real people.
Well,

293
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:23,070
the right rates of in this country been 
going down for 30 years.

294
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,040
They have been going down one.
Right.

295
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:27,140
But it's fantastic.
But they still get,

296
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:28,403
they still happen.
But you're never going to get rid of 

297
00:11:29,581 --> 00:11:30,414
that.
Right?

298
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,590
That is something,
no,

299
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:34,500
no.
You cannot like language police your way

300
00:11:34,501 --> 00:11:36,020
out of bigotry.
No one's saying Kevin,

301
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:36,863
which please don't you think culturally 
we've evolved past where we were a 

302
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,250
thousand years ago.
We all agree on that,

303
00:11:41,251 --> 00:11:42,270
right?
Sure.

304
00:11:42,271 --> 00:11:44,370
But you don't have to think of how we're
going to eradicate rape.

305
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,970
That's not going to have her.
No,

306
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,520
no.
Really.

307
00:11:47,521 --> 00:11:48,110
Of course not.

308
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,590
That's insane.
Well,

309
00:11:49,591 --> 00:11:50,424
one thing,
once we get to the point where we could 

310
00:11:50,821 --> 00:11:51,654
read each other's minds,
we have some sort of a embedded chip 

311
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,913
that allows us to,
how can you imagine anything worse than 

312
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:57,130
that?
It's going to happen.

313
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,470
Anything less than that?
I think we're kind of halfway there.

314
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,313
Each other's minds.
I don't even know how to read my own 

315
00:12:01,271 --> 00:12:02,320
mind.
My God,

316
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:05,410
don't you know?
I know and actually it's,

317
00:12:05,411 --> 00:12:06,610
it's actually,
you know,

318
00:12:06,611 --> 00:12:08,650
look this,
this masculine energy,

319
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,180
you know that everybody in this room has
inside of it.

320
00:12:11,181 --> 00:12:13,510
Like when you say that with your hands 
open,

321
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,280
like a jazz dancer,
you're

322
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,303
blonde tailored army jacket.
This masculine energy can not be 

323
00:12:22,391 --> 00:12:23,370
contained.
Listen,

324
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,213
Joe,
this masculine energy as like just 

325
00:12:25,451 --> 00:12:26,650
waiting to bust that.
Okay.

326
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:32,790
It's an explosion.
It can't be contained as a fuck you.

327
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,530
I'll try that again.
This masculine.

328
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,490
Maybe you could coach me through it.
Okay.

329
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:46,050
It's so hard,
but you've got sparkly dog tags on.

330
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:56,090
They collect.
Oh,

331
00:12:59,260 --> 00:12:59,670
sorry.

332
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:02,370
That's such a nice time last time having
a nice time.

333
00:13:02,371 --> 00:13:03,060
This stuff.
Wait,

334
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,430
we are having over time.
Uh,

335
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,390
I can see this which way?
This three hours is getting ready.

336
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,030
Just,
just roast to Milo time.

337
00:13:09,031 --> 00:13:11,910
That's fine.
Bring it a friendly my friend.

338
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,490
Actually my hair,
my hair was since you bring it up,

339
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:17,760
it's not as nice as last time I had,
I had a lovely looks great.

340
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:18,820
No,
it's okay.

341
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,680
Um,
all right.

342
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,090
Uh,
there is,

343
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,300
there is a masculine instinct and 
impulse to create,

344
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,171
you know,
to destroy,

345
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:25,770
to be,
you know,

346
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:28,200
to do certain things to competitiveness 
driven by hormones,

347
00:13:28,201 --> 00:13:29,530
you know,
to the testosterone instinct.

348
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,870
You know,
um,

349
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,700
and Camille Pauley was talking about 
this in the 90s,

350
00:13:32,701 --> 00:13:35,700
you know,
it's got to go somewhere and you look at

351
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,750
the,
I'm not suggesting that the men are just

352
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,800
going to rape me when you have to deal 
with it.

353
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,200
What I'm,
what I'm saying though is it,

354
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:44,883
if you bully men out of the public 
square and you sort of demonize and 

355
00:13:48,431 --> 00:13:51,900
ridicule and,
and almost make it legal,

356
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,230
uh,
healthy,

357
00:13:53,231 --> 00:13:54,064
normal male behaviors,
which is happening in schools and 

358
00:13:56,231 --> 00:13:57,064
colleges for sure.
And it's also happening in the public 

359
00:13:58,421 --> 00:13:59,254
square.
If you make it okay to say almost 

360
00:14:00,611 --> 00:14:02,230
anything about men,
if you,

361
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,300
um,
sort of bully man out of the public,

362
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,490
out of public life,
a bad things happen.

363
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,353
You know,
and people have that that has to come 

364
00:14:09,731 --> 00:14:13,420
out somewhere and on to your point,
fortunately we do live in a,

365
00:14:13,421 --> 00:14:14,254
in,
in evolved enough times where most of 

366
00:14:15,161 --> 00:14:17,500
the time it's just men letting off steam
on the Internet and comment sections.

367
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,180
I think,
uh,

368
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:24,070
but you knew that that dark,
what I say dog,

369
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,680
that,
that sort of dangerous energy that is in

370
00:14:26,681 --> 00:14:28,390
all men,
which is what women like him out,

371
00:14:28,391 --> 00:14:28,570
man.

372
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,310
It's certainly what meant like about men
in my case.

373
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,510
Um,
you know,

374
00:14:31,511 --> 00:14:32,344
root of all the best sex.
The reason we went to the stars that be 

375
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,530
built civilizations,
you know,

376
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,440
um,
the stuff that makes men awesome.

377
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,650
Does have a flip side to it and it's,
you know,

378
00:14:41,651 --> 00:14:42,970
it can be dangerous,
you know,

379
00:14:42,971 --> 00:14:46,690
men can be dangerous,
but it also can be managed of course.

380
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,250
But it can't be managed if you lie about
it.

381
00:14:48,251 --> 00:14:49,084
It can't manage the,
if you pretend that you can talk your 

382
00:14:50,021 --> 00:14:51,890
way out of it and it can't be in 
particular.

383
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:52,724
And most importantly,
women can't protect themselves from it 

384
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,710
if they are lied to about it.
And this sort of,

385
00:14:57,711 --> 00:14:58,511
you know,
masculinity.

386
00:14:58,511 --> 00:15:00,620
So fragile managers socialized to be 
violent.

387
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,510
They're not just socialized to be fine.
You know,

388
00:15:02,511 --> 00:15:05,300
this is a hormone thing.
Men just all more aggressive.

389
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,020
You know.

390
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,960
And if you,
I mean is for instance in colleges,

391
00:15:08,961 --> 00:15:09,794
right?
If you,

392
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:13,070
if you tell women that the worst things 
ever going to happen to them,

393
00:15:13,071 --> 00:15:14,870
if somebody's putting a hand on their,
on their leg,

394
00:15:14,871 --> 00:15:15,704
and you call that sexual assault and you
put that in the sexual assault 

395
00:15:18,231 --> 00:15:20,330
statistics and you know,
you tell women,

396
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,193
oh,
you can wear whatever you want and you 

397
00:15:21,561 --> 00:15:22,394
can go out at 3:00
AM wearing a miniskirt and no man has a 

398
00:15:23,641 --> 00:15:24,730
right to look at you.
And you know,

399
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,600
you know,
no victim blaming all the rest of it.

400
00:15:26,601 --> 00:15:30,370
You're telling women in fact that they 
can put themselves in danger and um,

401
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,270
bad things are going to happen to those 
women.

402
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:36,200
We do live in most of those times,
but we also have to recognize that there

403
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:37,034
is something,
there is something dark and dangerous 

404
00:15:39,501 --> 00:15:42,830
about men and it is what creates,
it's what it is,

405
00:15:42,831 --> 00:15:47,000
what has driven human civilization to 
the heights that it has arisen to.

406
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,520
But it is also why men for most of the 
prisons,

407
00:15:49,521 --> 00:15:50,354
right?
The sublime geniuses and the knuckle 

408
00:15:52,341 --> 00:15:55,880
dragging apes of our species are both 
male.

409
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,020
Right?
And that's,

410
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:59,540
and you can see that in a variety 
different things.

411
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,430
People don't take it very seriously.
But you can see for instance,

412
00:16:01,431 --> 00:16:04,640
in Iq distribution,
one of the suggestions that might be the

413
00:16:04,641 --> 00:16:05,540
case,
you know,

414
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:06,643
sublime musical and artistic geniuses up
in the very top end of the Iq scale 

415
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:12,410
where women tend not to exist.
Likewise,

416
00:16:12,411 --> 00:16:13,550
you know,
down in the knuckle draggers,

417
00:16:13,551 --> 00:16:14,384
70 and 80 Iq,
women tend not to exist down there 

418
00:16:15,831 --> 00:16:16,664
either.
Men are more variable than women in 

419
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:20,750
general.
Men are more complex I think,

420
00:16:20,751 --> 00:16:24,140
than women in some ways.
And this,

421
00:16:24,141 --> 00:16:24,974
you know,
there's the idea that you can just sort 

422
00:16:25,881 --> 00:16:30,350
of buzzfeed your way out of rape and 
civilization is just insane.

423
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,580
Buzzfeed your way out.

424
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,460
You know,
if you,

425
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,293
if you just,
if you publish enough listicles about 

426
00:16:34,821 --> 00:16:36,990
how masculinity is so fragile and white,
you know,

427
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:39,290
straight white men are the root of all 
evil,

428
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,150
that that's somehow going to stop rape.
No,

429
00:16:41,151 --> 00:16:41,984
in fact,
I think that's probably 

430
00:16:42,231 --> 00:16:44,120
counterproductive.
I think that's probably going to think,

431
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,920
going to push some men too,
but you know,

432
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:49,340
boil over because they're sick of being 
lied to and lied about.

433
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,920
But the good news is rape has been going
down for 30 years.

434
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,793
American college campuses are probably 
the safest place you could possibly be 

435
00:16:55,251 --> 00:16:56,900
as a,
as a young woman in America today,

436
00:16:56,901 --> 00:16:58,880
despite what the left tells you,
the lies it tells you about.

437
00:16:59,260 --> 00:16:59,990
Um,
uh,

438
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:02,030
you know,
about all sorts of things we're in,

439
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:02,923
we're in a good place,
but the left won't say that or 

440
00:17:04,551 --> 00:17:06,500
acknowledged victory because I'll put 
them all out of business.

441
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:09,110
Well,
there's a strange thing with masculinity

442
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,940
where it,
there's,

443
00:17:10,941 --> 00:17:14,660
there's ways to manage it.
And one of the best ways to manage it is

444
00:17:14,661 --> 00:17:15,494
martial arts.
And it's one of the things that's at 

445
00:17:17,061 --> 00:17:18,680
least encouraged,
uh,

446
00:17:18,681 --> 00:17:20,420
with,
with children and with young men.

447
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:22,570
And I think it's,
it's,

448
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:27,080
it's critically important to exercise 
that demon out of your system,

449
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,153
get that aggression out,
whether it's through some form of 

450
00:17:29,751 --> 00:17:30,584
sports,
but there's obviously problems with 

451
00:17:32,091 --> 00:17:34,370
that.
One of the big ones being cte,

452
00:17:34,371 --> 00:17:37,130
that's the same thing with the footage.
CTE.

453
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,770
It's chronic brain injury,
chronic traumatic encephalopathy.

454
00:17:40,771 --> 00:17:42,680
I have to be beating each other in the 
head.

455
00:17:42,681 --> 00:17:43,550
You could just,
you know,

456
00:17:43,551 --> 00:17:45,260
you could do athletics,
you could do something,

457
00:17:45,261 --> 00:17:45,900
you know,
but,

458
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,900
but my point being one of those,
the,

459
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:50,100
one of the reasons that martial arts are
such a good

460
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:50,933
vehicle is because it calms down one of 
the main issues with men and aggressive 

461
00:17:55,231 --> 00:17:56,610
behavior,
which is insecurity.

462
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:59,640
Insecurity leads to a lot more 
aggressive behavior.

463
00:17:59,641 --> 00:18:00,474
When men are more secure,
they're less likely to engage in 

464
00:18:03,481 --> 00:18:05,040
ridiculous behavior.
Right.

465
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,830
And what is the one product you okay?
Yeah,

466
00:18:07,831 --> 00:18:09,750
I'm sorry.
It's the fucking butter coffee.

467
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,083
Oh.
Um,

468
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,960
one of the,
I don't want you to die.

469
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,510
I don't want this to be your last 
episode from the gym.

470
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,600
I'm healthy as fuck.
Don't worry.

471
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,270
You look wonderful.
Thank you very much.

472
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,780
Bigger than last time you've been 
bulking out.

473
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,710
I've been lifting weights.
Pump it up.

474
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,080
We should talk about this.
I just had to train him.

475
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,540
Did you really?
I lost and nobody will know this because

476
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,750
I was such expensive clothes,
but I,

477
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,650
I lost 40 pounds in four and a half 
months.

478
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,513
What'd you do?

479
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,020
That's amazing.
Just not your face.

480
00:18:37,021 --> 00:18:38,040
Looks very thin.
Yeah.

481
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,690
Like from last summer was I saw you in 
October.

482
00:18:39,691 --> 00:18:40,320
Right.
You know,

483
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,320
look at this done by July 1st compton.
Uh,

484
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,320
and I lost like four inches off my waist
and like four and a half months.

485
00:18:46,321 --> 00:18:49,200
Just being disciplined,
making sure you worked out well.

486
00:18:49,201 --> 00:18:51,360
It really just diet and now I'm working 
on,

487
00:18:51,361 --> 00:18:52,290
you know,
brushing it.

488
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,610
Cut Sugar out.
Yeah.

489
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,260
That's the big one.
Everything really.

490
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,101
Yeah.
Just,

491
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:58,660
I was just used to just protein and 
leaves really rude.

492
00:18:58,670 --> 00:18:59,150
Um,
yeah.

493
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,410
You get blood work done.
Um,

494
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,380
no.
Uh,

495
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:02,214
I haven't,
but I'm,

496
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:05,490
I do it like twice a year if like 
insurance and everything is like off the

497
00:19:05,491 --> 00:19:06,700
charts healthy.
But to uh,

498
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,670
go,
go to a really good,

499
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,573
uh,
some doctor that understands nutrient 

500
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:15,210
levels and the mechanisms for absorption
and tell.

501
00:19:15,211 --> 00:19:16,800
He can tell you like what you're doing 
wrong,

502
00:19:16,801 --> 00:19:17,490
what you're doing right.

503
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,920
What you need to add.
I just heard something,

504
00:19:19,921 --> 00:19:20,754
I'm on a battery of,
of supplements now because I've just 

505
00:19:23,071 --> 00:19:24,690
started wanting to lifting program.
I've got the,

506
00:19:24,691 --> 00:19:25,524
we call them crazy pills cause I can 
never remember the long names for 

507
00:19:27,181 --> 00:19:28,770
things.
You'd know what they all are just these,

508
00:19:28,771 --> 00:19:30,840
you know,
these things for Gaba,

509
00:19:30,841 --> 00:19:32,600
things,
things for Mitochondria,

510
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:34,710
things for testosterone,
all sorts.

511
00:19:34,711 --> 00:19:35,544
Yeah.
But it's like when you have you back 

512
00:19:36,181 --> 00:19:37,470
next year,
I'm going to be,

513
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:39,241
well,
I want to do,

514
00:19:39,241 --> 00:19:40,074
I want to,
I want to go to Yale this year and to 

515
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,830
give a talk on cultural appropriation,
which you mentioned earlier and you want

516
00:19:43,831 --> 00:19:46,130
to do it in a skin tight leotard.
No,

517
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:46,973
that's a different date.
I want to do in full native American 

518
00:19:49,681 --> 00:19:50,870
costume.
Oh,

519
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,870
I want my tits out,
so I understand.

520
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,810
Yeah.
So yeah.

521
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:58,890
Is that cultural appropriation?
That's a weird,

522
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:01,460
weird,
yeah.

523
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,850
It's just a line.
The left tells you to,

524
00:20:02,851 --> 00:20:05,220
to try to control you to prep two I met 
you feel racist.

525
00:20:05,221 --> 00:20:06,330
Tamiflu and secure.
Well,

526
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:09,660
you say the left some people that are 
very insecure,

527
00:20:09,661 --> 00:20:10,494
they want to do that and like that,
that one small boy who got attacked by 

528
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,784
that girl in school and she was 
threatening to cut his hair because he 

529
00:20:16,451 --> 00:20:17,810
had,
because he had dreadlocks.

530
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,370
He look really good with them.
He looked better than he would've looked

531
00:20:20,371 --> 00:20:21,810
without the dreadlocks.
He did.

532
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,591
No,
I'm serious.

533
00:20:22,591 --> 00:20:22,990
Yeah.
No,

534
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:23,671
I'm sitting there,
listen,

535
00:20:23,671 --> 00:20:25,410
it's not,
the problem with that is of course,

536
00:20:25,411 --> 00:20:26,244
you know,
dreadlocks or not an African American 

537
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:28,644
thing.
I mean,

538
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,270
but this is precisely why the Greeks,
the Romans,

539
00:20:33,271 --> 00:20:34,350
I mean,
they go on forever.

540
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,230
This is what I'm going to say to them.
This is precisely my point.

541
00:20:37,231 --> 00:20:38,064
You know,
cultural appropriation isn't this sort 

542
00:20:38,881 --> 00:20:42,450
of like weird racism that ends in like 
1950 or whatever the left thing.

543
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:46,560
It's how artworks,
it's cultural appropriation from history

544
00:20:46,561 --> 00:20:49,270
include Picasso Volkner,
you know,

545
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:49,961
you're just,
you're gonna,

546
00:20:49,961 --> 00:20:51,280
you're gonna are you gonna Start Saying,
oh,

547
00:20:51,281 --> 00:20:52,840
wagner shouldn't have been a,
you know,

548
00:20:52,841 --> 00:20:55,180
drawing from the norse Eder and from,
you know,

549
00:20:55,181 --> 00:20:58,000
from the Neba lung and lead and all of 
these sort of norse myths that he use to

550
00:20:58,001 --> 00:20:59,980
craft their,
bring this knee belonging because that's

551
00:20:59,981 --> 00:21:02,110
cultural appropriate.
These people are insane.

552
00:21:02,111 --> 00:21:05,290
They've never read a book,
they've never read a book.

553
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:06,900
They don't understand how history and 
artwork.

554
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:09,790
And it's so frustrating to see 
impressionable young,

555
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:10,624
smart people start to soak this stuff up
because they just never hear the 

556
00:21:13,241 --> 00:21:14,074
alternatives,
which is what my college tours for 

557
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,151
because I,
I,

558
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:17,980
it's just shocks me.
It's horrifying.

559
00:21:17,981 --> 00:21:19,660
It's just based on such a,
uh,

560
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:23,980
his such historical ignorance.
What's a target of recreational outrage?

561
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:24,611
There's,
yes,

562
00:21:24,611 --> 00:21:25,270
it is.
Yeah.

563
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,360
Yeah.
And it is recreation.

564
00:21:26,361 --> 00:21:26,630
We,
right,

565
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:27,463
but they've found an area like that 
woman who was picking on that boy with 

566
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:33,310
the dreadlocks.
It was very cool girl and boy,

567
00:21:33,311 --> 00:21:36,250
whatever.
It's very clear that she was a bully and

568
00:21:36,251 --> 00:21:37,690
he was a small,
tiny,

569
00:21:37,691 --> 00:21:40,700
feeble little guy and she was fucking 
with them for the sres.

570
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,440
Yes,
she was.

571
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,180
Yes,
she was.

572
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,013
And,
and you know this is this the self 

573
00:21:43,961 --> 00:21:44,794
loathing thing,
which so often turns into bullying and 

574
00:21:46,091 --> 00:21:48,460
when you hear you do you know about her 
background as well,

575
00:21:48,461 --> 00:21:50,110
right?
She grew up in foster care.

576
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,020
She had a very horrible child.
Damaged as all hell.

577
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:53,411
Yeah,
man.

578
00:21:53,411 --> 00:21:55,720
She wants to,
she wants the rest of the to suffer like

579
00:21:55,721 --> 00:21:57,670
she thinks she's suffered.
Maybe she did suffer,

580
00:21:57,671 --> 00:21:58,504
but this is probably,
she probably did and I'm sorry about 

581
00:22:00,401 --> 00:22:00,970
that.
But no,

582
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:04,480
to cultural appropriation,
like having a go at somebody for wearing

583
00:22:04,481 --> 00:22:06,700
dreadlocks is not the way to get over 
your damage.

584
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,380
The way to get out of your damages 
therapy and drugs,

585
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,570
you know,
just just to deal with yourself.

586
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:12,203
It's a,
it's just sad that this is something 

587
00:22:13,481 --> 00:22:17,530
that has become a thing and it's a 
repeating thing when I'm going to cut it

588
00:22:17,531 --> 00:22:20,390
off at the root because it's a nonsense.
It's garbage.

589
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:21,743
I don't know if you're capable 
completely on your own of cutting it 

590
00:22:24,001 --> 00:22:24,521
off,
but oh,

591
00:22:24,521 --> 00:22:25,890
I'm going to salute you and your 
attitude.

592
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:28,030
I'm going to do it.
I'm going to do it just with that Indian

593
00:22:28,031 --> 00:22:29,050
outfit.
Oh No,

594
00:22:29,051 --> 00:22:29,291
no,
no.

595
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:30,820
I've got,
I've got a huge variety,

596
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,620
a variety of outfits planned for this 
year.

597
00:22:32,621 --> 00:22:35,440
I'm going to wear everything.
Everything the left finds offensive.

598
00:22:35,441 --> 00:22:38,410
What is the most offensive native 
American stuff?

599
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,510
It's usually the people that were the 
most maligned crest,

600
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,720
I think native cause it's Yale and 
they're very hypersensitive.

601
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,290
Can it,
cause the smart kids aren't violent.

602
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:49,780
Like some of them have been.
The smart kids are just like,

603
00:22:49,781 --> 00:22:51,160
just lose their minds,
you know,

604
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:53,390
and just start like spurting out.
Um,

605
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,453
so I think the native American stuff 
annoys in the most because they know 

606
00:22:57,011 --> 00:22:57,844
it's because they know the cultural 
appropriation element of it is such 

607
00:22:59,981 --> 00:23:01,660
rubbish.
And if they actually cared,

608
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:04,780
they would quit.
They would quit the college that is like

609
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:07,210
on a,
on a burial ground or something,

610
00:23:07,211 --> 00:23:08,650
you know,
whatever the hell Yale is built on.

611
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:10,983
Um,
I think it's because they know it's so 

612
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:14,230
absurd.
And insane.

613
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:17,800
Of course they're even more upset about 
it because the stakes are so low.

614
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,193
Um,
I think native Americans going to be 

615
00:23:21,251 --> 00:23:24,050
good.
I'm not sure if I can do black face.

616
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:27,190
I have to ask my editor about that.
You can and you must.

617
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,840
I can.
Why can't you,

618
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:30,730
Dave Chappelle did white face on TV.

619
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:31,960
I mean,
I think I can.

620
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:35,200
Why not if I can.
And so did Mariah Carey's ex husband,

621
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:36,700
did he the pretty one?
Nick,

622
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:37,980
uh,
nick cannon.

623
00:23:37,981 --> 00:23:39,360
Nick Cannon did take place.
Yeah,

624
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:40,990
he did.
I think it's fine,

625
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:45,070
but I know that it's impossible to be 
racist against white people.

626
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,160
Don't,
you know,

627
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:47,613
I'm not the most adorable thing that 
people have created to try to justify 

628
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,570
black racism against white people.
That it is not possible.

629
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:00,320
You know what it is and it's,
and it's this amazing combination of,

630
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,273
of,
of ignorance and condescension because 

631
00:24:04,281 --> 00:24:05,114
they're stupid and they'd never read a 
history book and they don't understand 

632
00:24:07,281 --> 00:24:09,350
how bigotry or hatred works or,
or any,

633
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:12,100
any kind of historical function or any 
psyche,

634
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:12,983
psychological process whatsoever.
And at the same time they're trying to 

635
00:24:15,561 --> 00:24:18,230
explain to you how you actually don't 
know what racism means.

636
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:19,700
You see,
racism isn't just,

637
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:20,683
you know,
thinking another racism as good as 

638
00:24:21,591 --> 00:24:22,030
yours.

639
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:24,530
Racism is actually a complex system of 
prejudice.

640
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:26,570
Oppression.
You only have to,

641
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,630
it can only be done if you have power 
and why people have power.

642
00:24:29,631 --> 00:24:31,730
Black people don't have any power.
That's,

643
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,593
it's not like there's a black president.
That's weird because at my college 

644
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,573
talkers,
black people forcing me off stage while 

645
00:24:36,531 --> 00:24:39,620
the university administration told 
Chicago peanut pd not to intervene.

646
00:24:39,621 --> 00:24:40,200
I mean,
what are you,

647
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,850
is this,
well this is at Depaul,

648
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:43,003
a Catholic University,
which has some of the most enthusiastic 

649
00:24:45,201 --> 00:24:47,900
abortion advocates on campus anywhere in
America.

650
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:48,973
I heard,
and I don't know if this is true that 

651
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,670
this took a port.
No,

652
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,260
they do.
It's so one of the most left wing places

653
00:24:54,261 --> 00:24:56,210
in the world.
It does have to funny expression,

654
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:59,690
enthusiastic abortion advocates.
Are you kidding me?

655
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:01,190
No,
I'm not joking.

656
00:25:01,191 --> 00:25:01,780
I'm,
this is,

657
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,430
this isn't just me.
They go like,

658
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,790
you know,
is it Lindy West that guardian nuggets,

659
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:06,351
she's like,
you know,

660
00:25:06,351 --> 00:25:09,410
shout your abortion was that it was a 
feminist Hashtag it trended.

661
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:12,020
They're proud of it.
They're proud of murdering babies.

662
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,880
They are perfectly happy to talk about 
it.

663
00:25:13,881 --> 00:25:16,120
They think it's a mark of pride like I'm
is,

664
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:19,430
I don't make this stuff up.
I just laugh along with everybody else.

665
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,990
You know,
I didn't invent this.

666
00:25:20,991 --> 00:25:22,400
They love the portions.
It's like,

667
00:25:22,401 --> 00:25:24,470
it's like a badge of honor.
It's like scout badges,

668
00:25:24,471 --> 00:25:26,210
you know,
like how many of you had sister,

669
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:29,150
I'm a serious,
these people are insane.

670
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,700
I'm,
I'm a favor of abortion.

671
00:25:31,701 --> 00:25:32,534
As long as you can't tell what it looks 
like Monday be your charge to shock me 

672
00:25:38,481 --> 00:25:40,360
and am on unshockable as soon as it 
starts looking at,

673
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:42,470
I mean I'm never,
I'm not,

674
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,453
not a person that would ever step in and
say you can and can't do anything with 

675
00:25:45,741 --> 00:25:48,290
your body as long as the baby's in the 
woman's body.

676
00:25:48,291 --> 00:25:51,770
Technically we differ on that one from 
that one.

677
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,010
Somebody else.
Well,

678
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,180
I'm,
do you think there's a different,

679
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:57,014
I'm hardline on,
cause you can't tell anybody what they 

680
00:26:00,471 --> 00:26:01,580
can and can't do with their body.
Well,

681
00:26:01,581 --> 00:26:04,010
it isn't just about the woman's body.
Once she becomes pregnant,

682
00:26:04,011 --> 00:26:06,240
she's responsible for another body,
another soul,

683
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,093
another human being.
And let's don't get into the soul thing 

684
00:26:07,971 --> 00:26:08,804
cause we had a very,
a very unproductive conversation about 

685
00:26:10,941 --> 00:26:11,774
that last time.
But,

686
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:12,501
but just,
you know,

687
00:26:12,501 --> 00:26:15,920
this is another human being and that 
woman has sole custody if you like.

688
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,170
And,
and so you can trust or of cells,

689
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:22,490
if it's like literally four or five 
cells get sucked out,

690
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,400
stop it.
Stop it.

691
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:26,811
Stop it.
You're just,

692
00:26:26,811 --> 00:26:29,180
look as a gay person,
I have to be against abortion because as

693
00:26:29,181 --> 00:26:30,800
soon as they start working out what the 
gay gene,

694
00:26:30,801 --> 00:26:31,634
whatever is it,
you know,

695
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:34,850
instead of going to get chopped because 
nobody wants a gay kid.

696
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:35,900
If you've got the choice.
Okay.

697
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,850
If from Sally cone,
the stupid in America,

698
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:42,070
early colon,
Sally Cone Cone,

699
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:42,540
k,
O,

700
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:46,500
h n is a lesbian Jewish lesbian feminist
on CNN.

701
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:48,830
She's the stupidest woman in America.
Really?

702
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:49,501
She's the one.
Yeah,

703
00:26:49,501 --> 00:26:49,771
no,
no.

704
00:26:49,771 --> 00:26:52,140
She had up against stiff competition.
She is the stupid zone.

705
00:26:52,141 --> 00:26:54,720
And America,
she's the one who said after Orlando,

706
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:55,381
um,
no,

707
00:26:55,381 --> 00:26:56,214
I'm serious.
She is,

708
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,830
she's the one after Orlando who said,
Oh,

709
00:26:58,831 --> 00:27:00,370
you know what actually like,
you know,

710
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:03,120
um,
conservative Christians,

711
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:03,870
you know,
treat,

712
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,610
treat us way worse than,
you know,

713
00:27:05,611 --> 00:27:07,460
any of my moderate Muslim friends and 
all this.

714
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,993
She doesn't,
she just used a Muslim who had been 

715
00:27:12,301 --> 00:27:13,800
trained in the,
you know,

716
00:27:13,801 --> 00:27:16,110
it had been indoctrinated in,
you know,

717
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,033
in this mosque in the north of Orlando.
What does it in Sanford and Orlando by 

718
00:27:20,551 --> 00:27:21,890
this guy who would,
um,

719
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,033
who,
who had been there three weeks before 

720
00:27:24,091 --> 00:27:24,924
and he was on the record as saying,
the compassionate thing to do was to 

721
00:27:26,341 --> 00:27:27,360
murder all homosexuals.

722
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,530
You know,
this is what happening in Orlando.

723
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,170
This guy growing up in that environment 
went out,

724
00:27:31,171 --> 00:27:33,690
murdered 49 gay people and maimed 
another 50,

725
00:27:33,691 --> 00:27:36,060
and she's upset about people who won't 
bake cakes.

726
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:36,781
I mean,
does she,

727
00:27:36,781 --> 00:27:39,270
is the stupidest woman in America 
Anyway,

728
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,920
um,
what we're talking about,

729
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:43,020
I don't even remember.
No.

730
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,350
Cultural appropriation.
Abortion.

731
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,370
Abortion.
Yes.

732
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:49,380
The Gauging Sal Khan.
There we go.

733
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:50,251
Uh,
no,

734
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:51,090
she,
um,

735
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:52,810
she,
she,

736
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:53,643
she famously,
well not famously because she's not 

737
00:27:54,661 --> 00:27:55,494
famous because she's,
she's just a source of amusement on 

738
00:27:57,331 --> 00:27:58,050
twitter.
But,

739
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,100
uh,
she,

740
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,140
she's on CNN weirdly.
Uh,

741
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,560
she said she'd like a gay kid.
She specifically wants a gay child,

742
00:28:04,561 --> 00:28:07,860
which I thought was just sort of weird 
and I just want a healthy kid.

743
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:10,650
Well,
why not just want a child or want,

744
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,940
you know,
a smart,

745
00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:12,930
athletic,
beautiful,

746
00:28:12,931 --> 00:28:13,591
popular kid.
No,

747
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:14,520
she wants a gay one.

748
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,340
Why?
Because she's a narcissist.

749
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,213
She doesn't care about anything.
It's going to happen to that child and 

750
00:28:18,361 --> 00:28:19,194
it's lifetime.
Any of the unhappy things that might 

751
00:28:20,431 --> 00:28:21,264
happen to that child.
And I'm not talking about bigotry or 

752
00:28:22,081 --> 00:28:23,730
whatever.
Let's say we cure homophobia.

753
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:24,683
Great,
but I'm having sex with somebody and 

754
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:28,140
cannot create a child with a person I 
love.

755
00:28:28,141 --> 00:28:29,400
And the,
in the act of intercourse,

756
00:28:29,401 --> 00:28:32,130
like that's kind of kind of rough 
frankly.

757
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,990
You know,
it's not great and a lot of people don't

758
00:28:33,991 --> 00:28:35,430
go through their lives thinking about 
that.

759
00:28:35,431 --> 00:28:37,290
But I've have that has occurred to me in
the past.

760
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:39,480
You know,
there are many reasons why you might not

761
00:28:39,481 --> 00:28:41,220
choose to be gay,
all else being equal.

762
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,020
And you know,
she's just a sort of narcissistic,

763
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:44,820
sociopath and Weirdo.
But most people,

764
00:28:44,821 --> 00:28:45,331
I think,
you know,

765
00:28:45,331 --> 00:28:47,340
if,
if we believe the gay lobby,

766
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,250
which lies and says people,
gays are born this way,

767
00:28:50,251 --> 00:28:51,930
which of course is rubbish,
uh,

768
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:55,190
if we believe them and we find,
and if scientists come,

769
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:56,290
I mean maybe,
maybe they're right.

770
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,380
If they are right and scientists come up
with this,

771
00:28:58,381 --> 00:28:59,214
this gay gene,
well was the first group of people to 

772
00:29:00,481 --> 00:29:02,040
go,
it's me anyway.

773
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:03,130
I don't,
I,

774
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:03,963
you're,
there's a lot of shit going on in these 

775
00:29:04,801 --> 00:29:06,090
conversations.
These sentences,

776
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:07,840
they go one way and another way.
Yeah.

777
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,930
That's how my brain works.
I'm sorry.

778
00:29:09,931 --> 00:29:10,764
We were talking about,
we were actually talking about being 

779
00:29:12,331 --> 00:29:15,270
born gay is a real thing.
He said that's what it's obvious.

780
00:29:15,271 --> 00:29:16,140
No,
it's obviously a mixture.

781
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,610
It's obviously a mixture of nature or 
nurture.

782
00:29:17,611 --> 00:29:19,200
But the gay lobby lies and says it's 
all,

783
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,063
well,
they did this and the ats that the 

784
00:29:20,401 --> 00:29:22,350
reason they did it as I'm in the 
eighties and nineties,

785
00:29:22,351 --> 00:29:24,390
because the religious right,
we're saying,

786
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:27,060
um,
that being gay was a bad moral choice.

787
00:29:27,061 --> 00:29:28,260
It was a bad lifestyle choice,
right?

788
00:29:28,261 --> 00:29:31,200
Remember the expression and uh,
of course,

789
00:29:31,201 --> 00:29:33,150
Christian Christians would say,
hate the sin,

790
00:29:33,151 --> 00:29:34,350
love the sinner and all the rest of it.

791
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:36,510
And there was this problem because gay 
people or gay,

792
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,030
the gay lobby,
by their logic there,

793
00:29:39,031 --> 00:29:40,210
right?
What can we do with this?

794
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:41,163
Aha?
What if we're like blacks or what if we 

795
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,070
like women?
What if this is just what we are?

796
00:29:45,071 --> 00:29:45,904
Because that makes them bigots.
So they invented this born this way 

797
00:29:48,101 --> 00:29:49,480
thing.
And the truth is that nobody knows.

798
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,373
Well,
did you ever see the study that was 

799
00:29:50,921 --> 00:29:51,754
done,
I believe is out of the University of 

800
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:53,973
Rome with a,
they found a direct correlation between 

801
00:29:55,931 --> 00:29:58,600
very promiscuous mothers and gay 
children,

802
00:29:59,020 --> 00:29:59,411
right?
Well,

803
00:29:59,411 --> 00:30:00,244
there's some,
there's some people who think that 

804
00:30:00,971 --> 00:30:03,090
things like that,
uh,

805
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:06,640
might have dual effects.
There could be genetic or even epogen or

806
00:30:06,641 --> 00:30:07,474
epigenetic.
If you buy into that stuff can be 

807
00:30:08,501 --> 00:30:11,450
epigenetic factors in the room and 
hormonal stuff that,

808
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,353
uh,
that comes about as a result of a woman 

809
00:30:13,931 --> 00:30:15,940
having a high sex drive that might 
result in a gate kid,

810
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,530
but also when the kid is born.

811
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:21,430
If the mom's still a whore,
then maybe I'm just saying,

812
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:22,030
right.
Um,

813
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:22,590
you know,
if,

814
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:23,620
if,
if Mommy's putting,

815
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:24,454
if Mommy's,
you know,

816
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:26,450
spreading her legs all over town,
uh,

817
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:28,180
could that affect a child's sexual 
development?

818
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:29,710
Of course.
So that,

819
00:30:29,711 --> 00:30:31,450
that one,
I do remember that one though.

820
00:30:31,451 --> 00:30:32,950
I didn't read it closely.
I do remember that one.

821
00:30:32,951 --> 00:30:36,280
And I think that what I came away from 
that with was if you have,

822
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:38,350
um,
if you have a hoe for a mom,

823
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,390
there's probably multiple reasons you 
might end up gay,

824
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:41,503
but they're there.
They didn't go that far with it because 

825
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:47,070
when you start accusing that mean 
you're,

826
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,850
you're making these,
I mean,

827
00:30:48,851 --> 00:30:50,830
I think you're probably on point with 
it,

828
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:51,783
right?
But that's not something a university 

829
00:30:52,751 --> 00:30:53,584
would ever say.
No because they're idiots because they 

830
00:30:54,731 --> 00:30:56,570
don't actually want to get to the truth.
They want to virtue signal.

831
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:58,210
Well,
there's a little bit of that,

832
00:30:58,211 --> 00:31:00,250
but it's all,
it's also one of those things where it's

833
00:31:00,251 --> 00:31:02,470
just really problematic.
Would you can't,

834
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:04,310
you can say that and ironically then 
yeah,

835
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:05,163
you can't prove it.
When you say tell the truth about their 

836
00:31:07,301 --> 00:31:08,134
sex lives is like expecting fat.
People tell the truth about the 

837
00:31:09,731 --> 00:31:11,470
calorific intake,
it just doesn't happen.

838
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:12,443
Well they believe that somehow or 
another it was some sort of a variation 

839
00:31:16,331 --> 00:31:19,460
on the x chromosome that made these 
women right,

840
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:22,030
not just psychologically attracted to 
men,

841
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,073
but that there was obviously there's 
some sort of a physical attraction that 

842
00:31:25,211 --> 00:31:26,044
heterosexual women have towards men and 
that should vary and it will vary on a 

843
00:31:28,901 --> 00:31:32,110
wide scale and the extreme end of the 
scale.

844
00:31:32,111 --> 00:31:32,944
They believe this just these women that 
are just almost like you roll a dick in 

845
00:31:36,011 --> 00:31:37,780
front of them,
they're like a kitten on a ball of yarn.

846
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:38,643
They just can't help know how they feel 
and that these women will pass this 

847
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,850
trait on even to their male children.
Interesting.

848
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:47,860
Interesting.
See my mother's quite frigid.

849
00:31:47,861 --> 00:31:48,980
So it just goes to show the,
the,

850
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:52,150
the,
the etiology of homosexuality is,

851
00:31:52,151 --> 00:31:52,970
you know,
multiple is,

852
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:54,580
is varied and complex.
Anyway,

853
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:59,020
that might be the only point I'm making 
is simply every credible sciences,

854
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:02,140
every reasonable person knows that it is
almost certainly a mixture of nature and

855
00:32:02,141 --> 00:32:04,720
nurture and that that mix can change 
from person to person.

856
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:07,840
Right?
All of these things can get mixed up and

857
00:32:07,841 --> 00:32:10,510
ended up with somebody choosing to fuck 
a guy or not fucking guy.

858
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,373
Right?
Right.

859
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,940
But the,
the gay lobby,

860
00:32:12,941 --> 00:32:15,070
because they were scared at the,
you know,

861
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,350
and because they wanted an easy answer,
I came up with this,

862
00:32:17,351 --> 00:32:18,041
you know,
whatever.

863
00:32:18,041 --> 00:32:21,340
Now it's embedded in culture.
Lady Gaga born this way and it's a lie.

864
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,540
I mean,
it's a lie saying that,

865
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,440
saying that if something is like not 
black and white and it's like probably,

866
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:31,830
actually it probably about 50 50 saying 
it's entirely black is a lie.

867
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:33,063
And that's a lie.
And the gape gay lobby lies to gay 

868
00:32:34,931 --> 00:32:37,030
people and that's partially born this 
way.

869
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:40,790
Doesn't make a good song,
partially partially born this way.

870
00:32:40,791 --> 00:32:41,624
Sounds like something you'd see on a 
planned parenthood for me as like 

871
00:32:45,081 --> 00:32:47,480
something that David Daleiden has 
exposed in his,

872
00:32:47,481 --> 00:32:49,190
uh,
in his undercover videos.

873
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:52,550
Uh,
I on returning to the abortion thing,

874
00:32:52,551 --> 00:32:57,080
I don't,
what don't you think that it's like many

875
00:32:57,081 --> 00:32:59,360
things like even homosexuality we were 
talking about,

876
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,253
there's a lot going on there to discuss 
and when you're talking about a very 

877
00:33:03,861 --> 00:33:06,680
small cluster of cells,
for me it starts at conception.

878
00:33:06,681 --> 00:33:07,514
I think from that moment on,
you're locked into this nine month 

879
00:33:10,911 --> 00:33:12,530
journey with the human inside your body.

880
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:13,330
Yeah.
Yeah.

881
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:14,360
Well,
if you want a merger,

882
00:33:14,361 --> 00:33:15,194
it then go ahead and murder it.
But be honest about what you're doing 

883
00:33:16,611 --> 00:33:20,120
and don't call it women's bodily choices
because that is sociopathy and that it's

884
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:21,860
two cells.
It's murder,

885
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,143
I think.
I think I'm thinking going to have to 

886
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:25,190
say yes.
Wow.

887
00:33:25,191 --> 00:33:27,200
That's a hard line.
You're a hard liner,

888
00:33:27,201 --> 00:33:29,540
sir.
I'm not hotline on very many things.

889
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:33,950
Aside from the friend that feminist to 
ugly and stupid and eastern mysticism,

890
00:33:33,951 --> 00:33:38,060
what is it that 48 days where they 
believe the soul enters the body.

891
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:42,980
That's the formation of the pineal gland
and the seat of the soul.

892
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:45,900
Isn't it like 48 days?
Can we just know about it?

893
00:33:45,901 --> 00:33:49,820
I'm a 48 day cutoffs and mysticism was 
not an area that I've,

894
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,800
uh,
no one had researched.

895
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:55,220
It was a new house to no one in it.
Then it's still a house.

896
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,380
It's still a house.
Yeah.

897
00:33:57,381 --> 00:33:59,570
But if it gets wrecked and no one has 
any memories,

898
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:02,600
it's no big deal if you say so.
I,

899
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,990
uh,
I'm just playing devil that devil's out.

900
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,530
Get you.
Do you,

901
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,030
do you do that?
I like that.

902
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,680
I think you've got,
what's the,

903
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,340
do you believe in the Myers brigg stuff 
like the e n t j stuff?

904
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:15,080
There's explained that to people.
Well,

905
00:34:15,081 --> 00:34:16,520
so there's basically,
it's,

906
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:20,720
it's this system of personality types.
And apparently if you,

907
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,660
if you can do sort of a 50 question test
or whatever,

908
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,503
it come up with a single intg NFP and 
it's supposed to be at to predict what 

909
00:34:27,381 --> 00:34:31,700
kind of job you would be good at and 
predict your sort of characteristics and

910
00:34:31,701 --> 00:34:33,860
behaviors and who,
who else in the world you'll get on with

911
00:34:33,861 --> 00:34:34,694
and how you'll succeed in life.
So I've got like the lawyers won the 

912
00:34:36,891 --> 00:34:37,700
devil's advocate one.

913
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,533
I think you have it too.
And it's a sort of voracious appetite 

914
00:34:40,701 --> 00:34:42,610
for information.
Love to read and find out.

915
00:34:42,611 --> 00:34:43,444
But everything love to talk to smart 
people love to be provocative and 

916
00:34:45,921 --> 00:34:46,754
interesting and sometimes adopt 
positions you don't necessarily hold 

917
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,753
because the debate is fascinating and 
love just the cut and thrust of 

918
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:56,270
intellectual argument discourse.
Yeah.

919
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,710
Uh,
I think you have that too.

920
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:58,281
Yeah.
So yeah,

921
00:34:58,281 --> 00:35:00,050
that's well,
if you believe in such things.

922
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:00,950
Yeah,
yeah.

923
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:01,783
No,
I do.

924
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:04,830
But I think also I'm a different person,
you know,

925
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:07,280
every six or seven months.
I mean,

926
00:35:07,281 --> 00:35:08,114
I think I'm constantly evolving and 
growing and reevaluating or at least 

927
00:35:11,391 --> 00:35:12,224
attempting to,
and I'm definitely a different person 

928
00:35:13,761 --> 00:35:14,594
than I was 10 or 20 years ago.
So if you take that into consideration 

929
00:35:17,811 --> 00:35:20,420
that that's my problem with a lot of 
these tests,

930
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:23,510
what they're doing is they're sort of 
testing who you are right now.

931
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:28,850
And one of the problems with those 
definitions is the self defining aspects

932
00:35:28,851 --> 00:35:30,110
of it.
Like you start saying,

933
00:35:30,111 --> 00:35:32,570
well this is me and this is who I am 
instead of just,

934
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,610
and then it becomes so fulfilling 
prophecy.

935
00:35:34,611 --> 00:35:35,444
You think you're locked in.
That's another one of the things I like 

936
00:35:37,801 --> 00:35:38,820
about it.
I should stop complimenting you.

937
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:39,923
Ah,
it's another one of the things I like 

938
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:41,970
about is you have a,
a great,

939
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:42,893
uh,
have well developed sense of 

940
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:44,603
intellectual humility and,
and you're always sort of open and 

941
00:35:46,741 --> 00:35:47,574
learning.
And I liked that because I think you 

942
00:35:48,661 --> 00:35:50,980
have to be,
I mean there's no way I like,

943
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,833
I like that in this day and age we have 
so many subjects that you can extract 

944
00:35:57,871 --> 00:35:58,704
information from.
It is impossible to know everything 

945
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:00,924
about everything.
And all the subjects that we're 

946
00:36:02,251 --> 00:36:04,140
discussing,
they all change.

947
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:06,120
There's new data comes in constantly.

948
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,730
And to pretend that you know everything 
about everything is just you couldn't,

949
00:36:08,731 --> 00:36:10,390
you can't,
you could do that in 1992.

950
00:36:10,391 --> 00:36:13,380
You can't do that today.
It's funny what they say about facts and

951
00:36:13,381 --> 00:36:15,270
science have a half life of seven years,
you know,

952
00:36:15,271 --> 00:36:18,840
everything that you think you know in 
science becomes wrong in under a decade,

953
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,580
in every field,
in nutrition,

954
00:36:20,581 --> 00:36:22,470
biology.
It's just constantly changing.

955
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:23,963
I find that fascinating instead of 
radical uncertainty about everything 

956
00:36:26,071 --> 00:36:27,870
around it's varied.
But I think this is,

957
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,180
this is why people would like to grasp 
the certainty.

958
00:36:30,181 --> 00:36:33,150
And it is why I'm going to hand you an 
argument here because this is it.

959
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:34,530
Cause I know you don't like religion 
very much.

960
00:36:34,531 --> 00:36:35,364
This is why people like faith so much 
because it gives them an anchor in a 

961
00:36:37,951 --> 00:36:42,180
very uncertain disinter mediated sort of
very uncertain,

962
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:43,170
uh,
you know,

963
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:44,003
globalized,
confusing world wherever you want to 

964
00:36:45,721 --> 00:36:47,910
sort of uprooted and thrown in this 
Maelstrom were nothing.

965
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:48,960
You know,
nothing seems,

966
00:36:48,961 --> 00:36:49,794
seems constant or true.
Local communities has been broken down 

967
00:36:51,781 --> 00:36:52,290
by,
you know,

968
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:54,780
big,
big states that take the role of parents

969
00:36:54,781 --> 00:36:55,561
and blah,
blah,

970
00:36:55,561 --> 00:36:56,110
blah.
You know,

971
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,090
um,
I think,

972
00:36:57,091 --> 00:36:58,620
I think people clear to that stuff,
but they also,

973
00:36:58,621 --> 00:37:02,070
of course,
cleave to less helpful systems of belief

974
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,770
like feminism.
I think you're right.

975
00:37:04,771 --> 00:37:06,600
And I think you can equate those two 
together.

976
00:37:06,601 --> 00:37:09,240
And I think that a lot of what faith 
does,

977
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,103
even if it's not based on a real thing,
it's a scaffolding for four for 

978
00:37:15,481 --> 00:37:19,920
security.
It's a scaffolding for a reasonable view

979
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:20,783
of the world you live in.
Having some moral guidelines that you 

980
00:37:25,111 --> 00:37:25,944
can follow that allow you to live a life
with more positive moments or negative 

981
00:37:29,341 --> 00:37:32,100
moments because you're sort of 
gravitating towards those in a Christian

982
00:37:32,101 --> 00:37:32,934
sense.
Right.

983
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,020
And,
and you know,

984
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:35,263
I've,
I don't get involved in conversations 

985
00:37:36,751 --> 00:37:37,584
trying to sort of persuade them of the 
existence of God because it's comes so 

986
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:39,840
completely pointless.

987
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:44,160
But let's just say that these,
this is a variety of belief systems from

988
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:44,994
which you can choose or which ones are 
better because there are some that are 

989
00:37:47,281 --> 00:37:49,280
good and some that are bad.
Um,

990
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:50,123
and I would say feminism and the race 
baiting of black lives matter and Islam 

991
00:37:52,981 --> 00:37:54,030
are bad.
Uh,

992
00:37:54,031 --> 00:37:57,290
Christianity on the whole is good or at 
least has had pretty good effects.

993
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:59,600
Pretty good influences.
Also had some horrible facts,

994
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,040
especially in the past.
We weren't going to do this,

995
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:04,440
we weren't going to do this session.
Sure.

996
00:38:04,441 --> 00:38:05,274
Whatever.
But Islam hasn't gone through the 

997
00:38:06,511 --> 00:38:07,500
enlightenment.
I mean,

998
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:08,560
I just think it,
Jesse,

999
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:12,120
did you guys getting one?
You don't think it's impossible.

1000
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,383
It's a possible change.
I think it's highly unlikely that Islam 

1001
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:18,003
will ever get to it.
I don't think it's ever going to engage 

1002
00:38:19,891 --> 00:38:22,590
properly with the modern world.
I think it just needs to be eradicated.

1003
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,630
Wow.
Yeah.

1004
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:26,490
And I've come to this conclusion after 
Orlando.

1005
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:30,570
I've seen what I've stopped being polite
about as low as was stopped being polite

1006
00:38:30,571 --> 00:38:35,270
about it.
I just think gay guy as well.

1007
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,740
I he wasn't he gay?
I mean what's,

1008
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,640
is that just a rumor?
Self healthy hating gay Christians.

1009
00:38:39,641 --> 00:38:41,770
They don't shoot up nightclubs,
but they could,

1010
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:42,870
I mean,
look,

1011
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,400
the guy who shot up those people in the 
movie theater in Aurora,

1012
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,470
Colorado,
that guy wasn't Islamic.

1013
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,120
He was just some nutty,
fuck.

1014
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,960
This guy just happened to be gay.
Self-Loathing,

1015
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:53,200
had guns.
You know,

1016
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:57,040
we're reading,
we're reading into a nutcase and various

1017
00:38:57,041 --> 00:38:58,040
different things and you,
and,

1018
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:58,903
and as you correctly say,
and I think have pinned on your twitter 

1019
00:39:01,451 --> 00:39:02,560
account.
We have a mental health problem.

1020
00:39:02,561 --> 00:39:04,330
This company off a gun problem.
Uh,

1021
00:39:04,331 --> 00:39:06,990
which I think is,
is disguise observation.

1022
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:08,163
This particular guy clearly drew on 
things that he was being taught by his 

1023
00:39:11,621 --> 00:39:13,410
faith and let's be,
they know,

1024
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:14,343
declared that he was doing it in the 
name of his faith and in the name of 

1025
00:39:17,141 --> 00:39:17,974
Isis,
right?

1026
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:20,620
At some point,
you've got to take the guy at his word.

1027
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,930
Dave Chappelle has a great joke about 
it.

1028
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:27,190
I don't want to give away as bit,
but essentially it's like,

1029
00:39:27,191 --> 00:39:28,860
it's quite a bit,
just do it.

1030
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,100
He just,
he goes,

1031
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:32,740
you can't claim something right before 
you do it.

1032
00:39:32,741 --> 00:39:34,320
Like right about,
eat a girl's pussy,

1033
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,710
go woo Tang.
Like,

1034
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:37,503
he can't,
he can't claim here in the Wu Tang clan 

1035
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:42,550
just by saying it right before you do 
it.

1036
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:44,770
I think it's fairly obvious from this 
guy,

1037
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:47,460
this guy's history.
I mean it was on the FBI watch list.

1038
00:39:47,461 --> 00:39:48,340
A bit started.
Yeah,

1039
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:49,413
it is fun,
but it's fun.

1040
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:50,643
At some point you've just got to accept 
when people say they're doing it in the 

1041
00:39:52,811 --> 00:39:53,920
name of a law,
I guess.

1042
00:39:53,921 --> 00:39:55,810
Okay fine.
We get it like good.

1043
00:39:56,030 --> 00:40:00,760
But you know like him saying that he was
doing it for isis,

1044
00:40:00,761 --> 00:40:02,260
that he pledged allegiance to isis.

1045
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:03,363
He didn't have like a history with Isis.
It was on the FBI watch list twice he 

1046
00:40:06,731 --> 00:40:10,390
was,
he was a bloody Islamic radical.

1047
00:40:10,391 --> 00:40:11,081
Right.
I mean,

1048
00:40:11,081 --> 00:40:11,914
you know,
there's no reason to have anybody with 

1049
00:40:12,551 --> 00:40:15,480
those surnames in this country at all.
Oh,

1050
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:18,640
file.
What about Aziz Ansari?

1051
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:19,993
Oh God.
He deserves to be deported solely 

1052
00:40:21,941 --> 00:40:26,110
because he's so unfunny.
He's so funny.

1053
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:30,030
I would deport boring unfunny people 
before Muslims,

1054
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:33,520
before feminists,
before vapers cyclists,

1055
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:34,403
vapors.
Oh,

1056
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:37,510
vapers I've got to go.
Vapers have got to go.

1057
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:38,403
They've got to go over the wall.
Deport how even the blue cigarettes or 

1058
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,290
you talking about the people that are 
holding onto like the water bottles,

1059
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:48,760
the punk thing,
those people shouldn't just be deported.

1060
00:40:48,761 --> 00:40:51,250
They should be.
They should be executed publicly.

1061
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:53,250
There is a set,
there is no rehab.

1062
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:54,993
No,
I'm serious friend Jonathan has one of 

1063
00:40:56,171 --> 00:40:57,460
those.
Jonathan and Canada,

1064
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,160
if you're hearing that.

1065
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,530
Of course he does.
He's Canadian,

1066
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,730
Canadian.
Good man.

1067
00:41:00,731 --> 00:41:04,360
He lives in Alberta.
Ooh Gosh.

1068
00:41:04,361 --> 00:41:05,194
Can you imagine,
can you imagine living in Alberta is 

1069
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:09,430
beautiful in the summer.
Oh please.

1070
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:11,890
But it,
you're surrounded by Canada.

1071
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:14,050
Canada's one of my favorite places in 
the world.

1072
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,333
Why?
Because the people are off because it 

1073
00:41:15,941 --> 00:41:18,550
reminds you how great America is.
They're awesome people.

1074
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,113
No,
they're not.

1075
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,450
They're very nice.
They're the nicest fucking people in the

1076
00:41:22,451 --> 00:41:23,380
world.
They really are.

1077
00:41:23,381 --> 00:41:27,370
I don't like Nice.
I don't like Nice me and I'm nice.

1078
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:30,870
Your lovely little exception.
I have a exception.

1079
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:33,540
You don't look nice.
I think that's how I get over it.

1080
00:41:33,541 --> 00:41:35,330
You know,
you look like you're about to rob me,

1081
00:41:35,331 --> 00:41:37,670
which I think is the only reason I can 
put up with your nice personality.

1082
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,260
You know,
cause like I said,

1083
00:41:39,261 --> 00:41:41,660
it'd be like clutching my wallet with 
one hand on my Dick with the other.

1084
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:48,670
Just kidding.
Just kidding.

1085
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,310
Yeah,
I didn't mean it.

1086
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:52,010
Canadians,
they are nice.

1087
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:54,880
They're great people.
It's a big fence.

1088
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:56,600
A lost country.
Russell Peters,

1089
00:41:56,601 --> 00:41:58,370
new Canadian.
I love them to death.

1090
00:41:58,371 --> 00:42:02,510
New Kit.
Well the new prime minister,

1091
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,740
um oh,
he's doing stuff.

1092
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:08,690
He's so good at doing some odd stuff.
This new thing about these,

1093
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:13,720
the identity cards of having the option 
of not having a gender.

1094
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:15,380
Yeah,
you could just,

1095
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:18,080
you could fill out attack helicopter if 
you want to send they're neutral.

1096
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:20,660
You can be gender neutral.
The national anthem,

1097
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:21,583
the Canadian national anthem.
They're taking Kim and her out of it or 

1098
00:42:24,501 --> 00:42:25,334
something.
I've done it.

1099
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:25,891
The Kit.
No,

1100
00:42:25,891 --> 00:42:26,660
no,
I,

1101
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:27,021
I,
no,

1102
00:42:27,021 --> 00:42:28,370
I didn't make this up.
The kid,

1103
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,800
you can look this up if you're listening
because I know I didn't make this up.

1104
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:31,873
The Canadian national anthem,
they were moving like gender specific 

1105
00:42:33,831 --> 00:42:35,630
references or not to say these people 
are insane.

1106
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:36,880
Well,
here's what's insane about it.

1107
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,660
What are the numbers we're talking 
about?

1108
00:42:38,661 --> 00:42:39,494
The people that are issued that have 
massive issue with a male or female 

1109
00:42:42,021 --> 00:42:45,440
gender personally?
Well who are neutral?

1110
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,520
Well,
lots of,

1111
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,353
lots of young kids because they're 
confused and because they've told us to 

1112
00:42:48,921 --> 00:42:51,200
think to do these people's frontal lobes
haven't formed yet.

1113
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,053
Right.
And they're being taught by culture and 

1114
00:42:52,881 --> 00:42:56,860
by their professors and by everything 
around them that you know,

1115
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,460
there have to be a man or a woman.
They can just,

1116
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:00,140
it of course,
of course it,

1117
00:43:00,141 --> 00:43:01,490
this is what,
this is what some of the,

1118
00:43:01,491 --> 00:43:02,324
um,
this is what some of the transgender 

1119
00:43:03,621 --> 00:43:05,720
people calls.
This looks great.

1120
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:07,423
Canadian parliament is close to adopting
a bill that would change the national 

1121
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:13,160
anthem o Canada to make it gender 
neutral.

1122
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:15,260
And is this because of the new prime 
minister?

1123
00:43:15,261 --> 00:43:16,700
This is true.
This is true.

1124
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,940
And when I said it was gay,
I don't necessarily mean that he sucks.

1125
00:43:18,941 --> 00:43:20,120
Take hold.
I'm sure he has.

1126
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,680
Um,
oh,

1127
00:43:21,681 --> 00:43:22,514
for sure.
Looking at it.

1128
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:23,683
Oh,
that is a face just begging to become 

1129
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:26,061
on.
I mean this is,

1130
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:27,010
this is no that,
no,

1131
00:43:27,011 --> 00:43:28,130
I know.
I've seen.

1132
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:32,270
I've seen men like this in clubs before.
Wives pick them up afterwards.

1133
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,560
Oh No,
I know.

1134
00:43:33,561 --> 00:43:34,370
I know.
Lives.

1135
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:36,530
Pick them up.
Of course the wives are in on it.

1136
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,660
We just accept the wives have their own 
boyfriends.

1137
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:43,340
Whole Sordid affair,
disgusting,

1138
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,050
reputable way up to where it should 
live.

1139
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:49,580
No,
this man,

1140
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:51,840
are you kidding me?
Justin Trudeau,

1141
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:54,560
mcm box,
sloppy gay hair and oh no,

1142
00:43:54,561 --> 00:43:55,400
no.
He's got,

1143
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,353
he's got that puffy figure.
He's got that puffy figure that sort of 

1144
00:43:58,881 --> 00:44:00,880
like over there.
Handsome man.

1145
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:05,690
He looks gay and I don't mean gay in the
good way.

1146
00:44:05,691 --> 00:44:10,430
I mean he looks like a fag.
I mean he looks lame week because he's a

1147
00:44:10,431 --> 00:44:12,080
cook.
He's a cook as a cook.

1148
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:16,370
I didn't know there was a cup full 
definition of cock until a week ago.

1149
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:19,190
We got into it with Joe Schilling on the
podcast.

1150
00:44:19,191 --> 00:44:20,024
I thought Kuk was just a guy whose wife 
gets fucked and he sorta cries and well 

1151
00:44:24,021 --> 00:44:26,690
that's the porn thing.
In fact,

1152
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:30,200
if you've ever had a crank,
a crying lank.

1153
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:31,380
No,
no.

1154
00:44:31,381 --> 00:44:33,060
It's cool cranking.
Oh,

1155
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:38,070
I mean gnarly.
So the cock would sit there and cry.

1156
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:39,023
It had a crank off to brexit when the 
pound plummeted and I checked how much 

1157
00:44:41,551 --> 00:44:43,110
of my portfolio was worth.
You're upset.

1158
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,960
Kind of happy at the same time.
Yeah.

1159
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:45,900
Yeah.
That's a crank.

1160
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:47,743
So,
but don't you think that that's a 

1161
00:44:48,481 --> 00:44:50,720
temporary drop and you just,
we just have to deal with,

1162
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:51,451
of course,
of course.

1163
00:44:51,451 --> 00:44:52,260
Of course.
Of course.

1164
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:52,651
Yeah.
No,

1165
00:44:52,651 --> 00:44:53,580
it's going to rebound,
rebound.

1166
00:44:53,581 --> 00:44:54,031
I mean,
you know,

1167
00:44:54,031 --> 00:44:56,060
if you actually,
if you actually don't listen to it,

1168
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:56,933
if you don't read like what Bloomberg 
and Msnbc or tweeting and you zoom out 

1169
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:01,373
on the,
on the,

1170
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:02,510
on the,
on the,

1171
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:04,800
the,
the pound and zoom out on the footsie.

1172
00:45:04,801 --> 00:45:06,480
Actually,
it doesn't look so bad at all.

1173
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:07,411
Uh,
you know,

1174
00:45:07,411 --> 00:45:07,960
it's,
it's,

1175
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:08,793
yeah,
it's a lot of scam or it's weird to me 

1176
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:11,124
that everybody was always so concerned 
about a one world government that was a 

1177
00:45:13,621 --> 00:45:14,454
big fear.

1178
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:16,780
There was a big fear of a new world 
order,

1179
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,500
one world government.
It was one of the big conspiracy fears.

1180
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:24,090
But then when England decides to be its 
own country and exit the European Union,

1181
00:45:24,091 --> 00:45:24,924
everybody's terrified.
The Sky is falling with the different 

1182
00:45:26,071 --> 00:45:27,090
people,
the different groups.

1183
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:28,373
So you had,
I mean there are some very smart people 

1184
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:34,890
I speak to who think that globalization 
is basically over and that this push to,

1185
00:45:34,891 --> 00:45:35,461
you know,
to,

1186
00:45:35,461 --> 00:45:36,294
to have this push for open borders 
around the world hasn't worked and 

1187
00:45:39,811 --> 00:45:41,400
people don't like it.
And the,

1188
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:42,000
you know,
if you look,

1189
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,160
if you read the work of like Jonathan 
Heit or whatever,

1190
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,370
you will discover that this sort of 
racism thing,

1191
00:45:47,371 --> 00:45:48,204
it's the level of evolutionary thing.
People like being with their own tribe 

1192
00:45:49,921 --> 00:45:51,550
and that's not a racism thing.
And it's just that,

1193
00:45:51,551 --> 00:45:52,384
that,
that is an evolutionary advantage 

1194
00:45:54,421 --> 00:45:57,990
because you don't have to get over all 
of the cultural barriers and just get on

1195
00:45:57,991 --> 00:45:58,824
with doing shit.

1196
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:00,660
Uh,
you,

1197
00:46:00,661 --> 00:46:03,690
um,
you're seeing all across the world,

1198
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:04,643
not just in Europe as a result of the 
globalist policies of Angela Merkel and 

1199
00:46:08,141 --> 00:46:09,150
all the rest of it,
uh,

1200
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:09,984
in Germany,
brexit in Europe and the rise of trump 

1201
00:46:11,641 --> 00:46:14,520
and America,
people returning to nationalism.

1202
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:16,290
By which we don't mean,
you know,

1203
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:20,340
racism by which we mean simply pride in 
nation culture and lesser in the West is

1204
00:46:20,341 --> 00:46:20,971
the best.
You know,

1205
00:46:20,971 --> 00:46:21,980
we are,
uh,

1206
00:46:21,981 --> 00:46:23,460
you know,
Europe and America,

1207
00:46:23,461 --> 00:46:25,650
the best bit of the world.
And people who,

1208
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,313
you know,
can't get wrap their heads around that 

1209
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:32,180
don't understand why people might wish 
to preserve the,

1210
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:36,120
the cultures that created Mozart and 
Shakespeare and Wagner,

1211
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:37,373
they don't understand why.
They also don't understand the economic 

1212
00:46:39,181 --> 00:46:40,014
pressures on those people who had the 
global one world government conspiracy 

1213
00:46:42,661 --> 00:46:43,111
theories.
Well,

1214
00:46:43,111 --> 00:46:43,944
they tended to be lower income people 
who are worried about centralization of 

1215
00:46:47,941 --> 00:46:48,720
power away from them.

1216
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,860
And you know,
the,

1217
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:51,120
as you know,
it was these,

1218
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,313
these liberals,
American liberals who crowing about the 

1219
00:46:53,281 --> 00:46:54,550
Browning of America or this kind of 
stuff,

1220
00:46:54,551 --> 00:46:55,980
or they're worried about their culture,
their families,

1221
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,560
depressed wages,
economics as well,

1222
00:46:57,561 --> 00:46:58,394
all that kind of stuff.
The people who are worried on the other 

1223
00:46:59,431 --> 00:47:00,264
hand about this now are the elites.
So you're talking about two different 

1224
00:47:02,671 --> 00:47:03,990
groups and I'm like,
this is the main,

1225
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:06,120
this is the main route.
This is really the main fight.

1226
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:08,240
Now this election,
uh,

1227
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:09,143
in America and most of the big elections
and referendums over the next 10 years 

1228
00:47:11,821 --> 00:47:12,654
are going to be about two things.
One of them driven by economics and one 

1229
00:47:15,211 --> 00:47:18,150
of them driven by culture and politics.
The economics,

1230
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:19,380
the economics.
One is,

1231
00:47:19,381 --> 00:47:21,960
is you know,
elites versus the proles.

1232
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:22,973
It's the,
it's the moneyed international few 

1233
00:47:24,901 --> 00:47:28,350
versus the rest of us.
Proles being proletariat for people.

1234
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:28,990
Right.
You know,

1235
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:30,130
the,
the sort of the

1236
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:30,963
rest of us who are worried about wages,
worried about immigration and worried 

1237
00:47:33,431 --> 00:47:34,680
about culture.
What about the,

1238
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:35,420
the,
the,

1239
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:36,253
the fate of our country.
And the other one of course is men view 

1240
00:47:38,681 --> 00:47:39,514
women,
which is entirely manufactured by the 

1241
00:47:41,051 --> 00:47:41,740
left.
Um,

1242
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:42,573
and I think the more I see the American 
election entirely through the prism of 

1243
00:47:44,921 --> 00:47:45,754
men versus women,
I think trump at trump versus hillary 

1244
00:47:47,261 --> 00:47:48,340
is,
um,

1245
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:48,941
is,
is a,

1246
00:47:48,941 --> 00:47:51,010
is a clash of the titans between,
you know,

1247
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:52,750
the strong,
blustery,

1248
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:54,160
um,
outward looking,

1249
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:55,533
um,
strong male archetype versus the status 

1250
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:00,920
establishment feminism of,
you know,

1251
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:02,680
if,
if Clinton and the Democrats,

1252
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:03,843
this,
this election really is men view women 

1253
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:07,060
and it's not nice to put it in that way,
but the left did it not,

1254
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:07,903
have you seen the compilation of the 
things that she has said that she did 

1255
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:15,940
versus the things that the FBI has said 
that she did?

1256
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:17,050
Oh my God,
that woman,

1257
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:21,160
I have to be careful that I miss.
I have a day job aside from having,

1258
00:48:21,161 --> 00:48:21,994
doing fun things like this.
I do have a day job as an editor at a 

1259
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:25,063
Breitbart,
so I have to be very careful what names 

1260
00:48:26,561 --> 00:48:27,970
I call people.
Yes.

1261
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:33,060
But markable Rooney Mara lies are out 
there and can say it very clear,

1262
00:48:35,261 --> 00:48:37,210
remarkable,
very obvious.

1263
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:38,890
She did not tell the truth.
She,

1264
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:42,040
she lied about how many device,
if you go to,

1265
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:45,850
there's a instagram page that has a 
compilation of it,

1266
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:49,510
I think it's called liberal tears.
It goes back and forth.

1267
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:50,373
Yes.
It shows what the FBI said she did and 

1268
00:48:52,571 --> 00:48:56,260
what she said she did.
She said she only used one device.

1269
00:48:56,290 --> 00:48:57,123
She never sent anything that was 
classified and they said she's multiple 

1270
00:48:59,741 --> 00:49:00,574
devices,
sent many classified things and they're 

1271
00:49:02,351 --> 00:49:03,184
gone.
I mean it's the difference between with 

1272
00:49:03,791 --> 00:49:08,200
the SPD FBI statement was what she said,
but then she's clearly being deceptive.

1273
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:10,090
But the Department of Justice is on her 
side though.

1274
00:49:10,091 --> 00:49:10,601
I mean,
you know,

1275
00:49:10,601 --> 00:49:11,191
they,
they,

1276
00:49:11,191 --> 00:49:12,170
they said the,
uh,

1277
00:49:12,171 --> 00:49:15,170
it was it Camy Komi Cami,
I caught Mary's name to get,

1278
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:17,380
the guy says,
the guy says we've never prosecuted.

1279
00:49:17,381 --> 00:49:18,214
He said he's in his yesterday for,
we've never prosecuted somebody for 

1280
00:49:20,351 --> 00:49:21,184
doing what Hillary did in a way of 
trying to sort of explain away why they 

1281
00:49:23,081 --> 00:49:24,370
weren't pressing charges.
They have,

1282
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,160
they've issued press releases about 
people in the past.

1283
00:49:27,161 --> 00:49:31,870
I tweeted it yesterday about Petraeus.
General Petraeus is the whole reason why

1284
00:49:31,871 --> 00:49:32,980
he was removed.
They have,

1285
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,700
they have issued press releases crowing 
about finding these guys in the past.

1286
00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:37,690
You know,
this is,

1287
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:38,523
this is,
I mean this just shows you how dumb Fox 

1288
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:42,790
News can be sometimes thinking that it 
was going to be an indictment here.

1289
00:49:42,791 --> 00:49:45,040
Everybody knew Democrats don't indict 
Democrats,

1290
00:49:45,041 --> 00:49:45,874
right?
Well,

1291
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:47,513
an presidency,
Hillary was never going to be indicted 

1292
00:49:49,391 --> 00:49:50,320
with Obama in the White House.

1293
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,210
It was not going to happen.
Not only that,

1294
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,610
if she does get indicted and she gets 
removed from the race,

1295
00:49:54,611 --> 00:49:56,650
who the fuck is there on the democratic 
side?

1296
00:49:57,210 --> 00:49:59,200
Joe Biden want Bernie back,
get buried,

1297
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,080
keep burning.
No,

1298
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:01,923
I like him and I like to do to the 
Bernie supporters fall into two camps 

1299
00:50:05,261 --> 00:50:06,094
there like the crazy gender activists 
and race baiters but I think that's 

1300
00:50:08,591 --> 00:50:09,424
probably only 20% of Bernie people and 
the rest of the Bernie fans aren't that 

1301
00:50:12,491 --> 00:50:14,410
dissimilar from trump fans.
You know,

1302
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:15,860
there are people who don't like this 
tablet.

1303
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:16,993
I'm sick of being lied to or you know,
are fed up of the consequences of 

1304
00:50:19,721 --> 00:50:20,980
globalization on,
on,

1305
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:22,570
you know,
native populations if you like,

1306
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:23,613
worried about all sorts of things.
And they express themselves very 

1307
00:50:25,751 --> 00:50:26,890
differently from the trump fans.
You know,

1308
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,840
don't use the same language and it,
but even the,

1309
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:30,980
I mean the polls are saying,
what does it,

1310
00:50:30,981 --> 00:50:33,290
20 30% of Bernie supporters might come 
over to trump and the election.

1311
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:34,770
That doesn't surprise me at all.
No.

1312
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:35,623
Cause they're very similar people.
I liked Bernie supporters and I like 

1313
00:50:38,121 --> 00:50:39,860
Bernie Sanders.
I think he's all right.

1314
00:50:39,861 --> 00:50:43,070
Hillary is the enemy.
Well she is the establishment.

1315
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:44,053
I mean she is as established a 
politician as he could possibly get and 

1316
00:50:47,171 --> 00:50:48,170
she has deep,
deep,

1317
00:50:48,171 --> 00:50:49,440
deep in the system.
Yeah.

1318
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,590
And there's just a lot of darkness to 
that.

1319
00:50:51,591 --> 00:50:52,424
There's a lot of danger to that.
Does a lot of danger to embracing that 

1320
00:50:54,321 --> 00:50:55,154
just simply because she has a vagina.
My wife is going to vote for just cause 

1321
00:50:58,371 --> 00:50:59,900
she has a vagina.
Your wife need no,

1322
00:50:59,901 --> 00:51:01,130
I wouldn't say that.
Uh,

1323
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:02,990
I do all those things to her.
It doesn't help.

1324
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:06,400
Um,
aren't you looking forward to this?

1325
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:08,560
Here's the video.
Here's the,

1326
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,430
here's,
here's the video.

1327
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:11,960
Listen to this.
Listen to this,

1328
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:16,220
um,
classified material to anyone.

1329
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:19,760
There is no classified material.
110 emails.

1330
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:22,183
Email chains have been determined by the
owning agency to contains classified 

1331
00:51:26,091 --> 00:51:29,690
information at the time they were sent 
or received.

1332
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:34,670
I provided all my emails that could 
possibly be work related,

1333
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:39,730
several thousand work related emails 
that were not among the group of 30,000

1334
00:51:40,401 --> 00:51:41,234
emails returned by Secretary Clinton.
I thought using one device would be 

1335
00:51:44,361 --> 00:51:45,194
simpler.
She also use numerous mobile devices to 

1336
00:51:47,901 --> 00:51:48,734
send in to read email.
There were no security breaches you'd 

1337
00:51:52,311 --> 00:51:55,900
use.
Possible hostile actors gained access to

1338
00:51:55,910 --> 00:51:57,550
secretary Clinton's personal email.
Kevin.

1339
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:58,413
It was my practice to communicate with 
State Department and other government 

1340
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:04,710
officials on there.
Dot Gov accounts.

1341
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:05,623
Hostile actors gained access to the 
private commercial email accounts of 

1342
00:52:09,470 --> 00:52:12,230
people was home.
Secretary Clinton was in regular contact

1343
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,090
from her personal account.
Um,

1344
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:17,330
no doubt that we've done exactly what we
should have done.

1345
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:21,530
They were extremely careless handling a 
very sensitive,

1346
00:52:21,531 --> 00:52:23,160
highly classified.
This is dre,

1347
00:52:23,161 --> 00:52:25,100
nicely structured and judge for 
themselves.

1348
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:26,413
We cannot find a case that would support
bringing criminal charges on these 

1349
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:34,490
facts.
To be clear.

1350
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:38,090
This is not to suggest that in similar 
circumstances,

1351
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:42,230
a person who engaged in this activity 
would face no consequences.

1352
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:44,750
Americans will find that to,
you know,

1353
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:45,733
interesting.
And I look forward to having a 

1354
00:52:47,541 --> 00:52:50,230
discussion about them.
Nice.

1355
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,330
Nice.
She's a crook.

1356
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,553
She a crooked hillary.
Crooked Hillary as the sainted God 

1357
00:52:56,921 --> 00:52:58,530
Emperor Donald Trump.
That's just,

1358
00:52:58,570 --> 00:53:00,230
that's just a liar.
I mean,

1359
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:01,393
you know that is just a liar.
Aren't you looking forward to the 

1360
00:53:02,771 --> 00:53:05,140
debates though?
I mean I am,

1361
00:53:05,141 --> 00:53:07,500
but the problem is like he's going to 
Crucey,

1362
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:12,190
he starts name calling and all the jazz 
that goes along with that.

1363
00:53:12,191 --> 00:53:14,530
And he says preposterous things about 
Mexico,

1364
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:15,753
about them being a bunch of rapists and 
next thing you know he didn't say that 

1365
00:53:18,881 --> 00:53:23,881
someone's doing the rabbit said that.
Never said that puncture of rapists.

1366
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:25,500
Well he didn't say it that way.
No,

1367
00:53:25,501 --> 00:53:26,220
he said Mexico

1368
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:27,053
is not sending as best people and that 
many of the people who come over are 

1369
00:53:29,221 --> 00:53:31,380
rapists and criminals.
That's all true.

1370
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:34,860
And what has happened since the 
pronounce the the conservative press has

1371
00:53:34,861 --> 00:53:37,980
been more alert and awake to this and 
had been and been reimbursed.

1372
00:53:37,981 --> 00:53:39,540
And if you like,
look at it,

1373
00:53:39,541 --> 00:53:40,374
we're finding these guys that are caught
on a cleaner court for raping and 

1374
00:53:42,451 --> 00:53:44,700
killing and stealing things and they've 
been deported six times.

1375
00:53:44,701 --> 00:53:45,301
We're finding all,
you know,

1376
00:53:45,301 --> 00:53:46,134
there's this,
this poor girl got murdered by an 

1377
00:53:46,921 --> 00:53:48,210
immigrant,
been deported four times.

1378
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:50,790
He's not wrong.
You might not like the way he says it,

1379
00:53:50,791 --> 00:53:51,624
but he's not wrong the way as it is 
definitely problematic and it really 

1380
00:53:53,851 --> 00:53:54,684
hurts the people that x size,
that word from your vocal problematic 

1381
00:53:57,970 --> 00:53:59,880
because it's don't you know it's a 
progressive word.

1382
00:53:59,881 --> 00:54:00,714
That's what they sound campuses.
Actually I find what you're saying 

1383
00:54:02,161 --> 00:54:02,994
really problem.

1384
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:04,231
You need,
no,

1385
00:54:04,231 --> 00:54:05,640
I'm serious.
I'm serious.

1386
00:54:05,641 --> 00:54:08,130
You need to get rid of this.
We need to get rid of this a problem.

1387
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:13,050
And when you can communicate and that is
a social justice dog whistle.

1388
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:15,540
When people sit,
when people hear you say problematic,

1389
00:54:15,541 --> 00:54:19,680
they think saying that word feminism 
problematic was ever I know.

1390
00:54:19,681 --> 00:54:22,470
But language language sometimes 
accelerates past us.

1391
00:54:22,471 --> 00:54:23,350
You know,
um,

1392
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:26,430
well recharged.
Retard.

1393
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:29,610
Retard is fine.
[inaudible] is fine and retarded is fine

1394
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:34,050
and love you gay for I can't give you,
I can't give you a cripple pass,

1395
00:54:34,051 --> 00:54:37,620
but I can give you a fast pass and you 
can have a fast pass for gay,

1396
00:54:37,621 --> 00:54:39,450
queer and Faggot because they're fine 
too,

1397
00:54:39,730 --> 00:54:42,180
but people are not going to accept it.
You could use it.

1398
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,890
I do.
Someone told me,

1399
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:47,690
I had a discussion because I called my 
dog a faggot and one of my,

1400
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,240
one of my comedy specials and uh,
it was just,

1401
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:53,100
it was a stupid bit.

1402
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:55,470
And the guy said,
this is where it was really,

1403
00:54:55,471 --> 00:54:56,790
it was a comedy central guy.
He goes,

1404
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,370
only we can use that.
And I go,

1405
00:54:59,371 --> 00:55:00,570
what?
And he goes,

1406
00:55:00,571 --> 00:55:01,620
yes,
it's our nigger.

1407
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,270
And I said,
that's the gay shit I've ever heard.

1408
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:07,080
I said,
no,

1409
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:08,190
but that's true.
I don't,

1410
00:55:08,190 --> 00:55:10,320
it's a real conversation I had with a 
real person.

1411
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,210
But no,
I don't agree with all of this.

1412
00:55:12,211 --> 00:55:14,910
I think boards should be liberated.
And once you liberate them,

1413
00:55:14,911 --> 00:55:16,710
you rob them of their ability to hurt 
people.

1414
00:55:16,711 --> 00:55:19,440
You rob them of their ability to wound 
and you stop giving them power.

1415
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:23,490
And more important than that,
you don't just rob racist,

1416
00:55:23,491 --> 00:55:24,324
sexist,
and homophobic of a word in their 

1417
00:55:26,071 --> 00:55:29,040
arsenal.
But you also rob social justice warriors

1418
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:30,023
of the ability to bully and police and 
publicly shame people for using loads 

1419
00:55:33,391 --> 00:55:34,650
that are fine.
Well,

1420
00:55:34,651 --> 00:55:35,484
the problem is when you give words 
magical powers and so words are about 

1421
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:39,334
content.

1422
00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:41,160
And you know,
when you know,

1423
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:43,800
when someone does like what was the 
Louis Ck joke?

1424
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:45,001
Uh,
he goes,

1425
00:55:45,001 --> 00:55:45,834
what if someone's just being a faggot?
He knows he doesn't have anything to do 

1426
00:55:48,091 --> 00:55:48,924
with being gay.
Like did you know the people from 

1427
00:55:50,161 --> 00:55:52,170
Phoenix to called Phoenicians?
Oh,

1428
00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:53,510
shut up faggot.
Yeah,

1429
00:55:54,270 --> 00:55:55,510
I agree.
I said,

1430
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:58,770
I recorded episode of my show yesterday 
with Ann Coulter and she said,

1431
00:55:58,771 --> 00:55:59,820
that's gay.
And I said,

1432
00:55:59,821 --> 00:56:02,940
I hope you don't mean homosexual.
I hope you mean gay in its prestige,

1433
00:56:02,941 --> 00:56:05,130
meaning in my view,
which is rubbish,

1434
00:56:05,131 --> 00:56:07,860
lame crap.
Hillary supporting immigrant loving,

1435
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,570
you know,
that's by immigrant loving.

1436
00:56:09,571 --> 00:56:12,770
But my dad's family were immigrants.
I mean bad immigrants,

1437
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:14,123
you know what I mean?
I didn't mean like my family are bad 

1438
00:56:15,571 --> 00:56:18,540
immigrant.
I don't mean handsome,

1439
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:19,950
charming,
successful,

1440
00:56:19,951 --> 00:56:24,040
blonde haired British immigrants.
I mean Donald Trump's rapists,

1441
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,260
those bad ones,
those bad ones,

1442
00:56:26,261 --> 00:56:27,550
the brownies,
no,

1443
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:28,240
it's got nothing to do.

1444
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,640
It's got nothing to do with skin color.
It's about culture.

1445
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:32,220
It's about culture.
And you're,

1446
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:33,123
you know,
and this is what's happening in item of 

1447
00:56:35,591 --> 00:56:37,900
all people.
I don't have a problem with brown skin,

1448
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:40,270
but as you know,
but um,

1449
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:42,820
it's about culture.
And when you import,

1450
00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:43,770
you know,
as an,

1451
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:46,630
as happening in Germany,
these barbaric,

1452
00:56:46,631 --> 00:56:47,890
medieval,
um,

1453
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:50,500
attitudes to women and gays,
bad things happen.

1454
00:56:50,501 --> 00:56:51,334
And actually that doesn't just service 
to the barbarians and that is a real 

1455
00:56:53,831 --> 00:56:54,664
problem,
right?

1456
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:57,700
And that's a problem that the left just 
does not want to face it.

1457
00:56:57,701 --> 00:57:00,370
That there are cultures dislike.
There are some of the,

1458
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:03,100
they're,
they're terrible people in all cultures,

1459
00:57:03,101 --> 00:57:03,934
right?
We can all,

1460
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:07,300
there are cultures that are not as good 
as ours,

1461
00:57:07,410 --> 00:57:08,010
right?
Briefly,

1462
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:08,843
system choice.
We shouldn't import them here at our 

1463
00:57:10,991 --> 00:57:13,960
prison system is filled with people that
have done terrible things,

1464
00:57:13,961 --> 00:57:14,350
right?

1465
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:15,760
So even in the best country in the 
world,

1466
00:57:15,761 --> 00:57:18,250
there are people in this country that 
have done terrible things,

1467
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:19,593
but there's,
there's a general attitude about women 

1468
00:57:22,181 --> 00:57:23,014
in the Middle East that has been 
supported by the people that are in 

1469
00:57:26,441 --> 00:57:31,120
charge of the countries like Saudi 
Arabia where the women could not drive.

1470
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:32,220
It's endemic.
Well,

1471
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:33,460
that one,
I'm with them on.

1472
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:35,950
No,
sometimes no,

1473
00:57:35,951 --> 00:57:36,221
no,
no,

1474
00:57:36,221 --> 00:57:37,054
no.
Sometimes sometimes good things can 

1475
00:57:38,291 --> 00:57:39,790
happen for bad reasons,
you know,

1476
00:57:39,810 --> 00:57:42,210
and the chicks don't drive accidentally 
stone.

1477
00:57:42,310 --> 00:57:44,290
They've accidentally stumbled on a good 
rule.

1478
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:47,800
Women should not be behind the 
heterosexual male.

1479
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:48,663
If a,
I want a girl to come over my house and 

1480
00:57:49,871 --> 00:57:52,450
fuck and a should be sending a car full,
Huh?

1481
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:53,393
Oh right.
But what if I was send your chauffeur 

1482
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:56,920
central sheriff,
then you should have some sort of,

1483
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,073
then you should have some sort of,
some sorts of disreputable midnight 

1484
00:58:00,341 --> 00:58:01,174
trust someone.

1485
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:05,020
Sometimes it's good to be able to ask 
good old carriage for her.

1486
00:58:05,021 --> 00:58:06,880
She comes over with their own pillow.
You know what I'm saying?

1487
00:58:06,910 --> 00:58:08,320
Without own pillar.
That's a good girl.

1488
00:58:08,350 --> 00:58:11,200
Do you make people not now,
obviously some girls like jerome pillow,

1489
00:58:12,090 --> 00:58:12,923
so fucked up women are a mess.
No guy comes over a girl's house or own 

1490
00:58:17,770 --> 00:58:18,690
pillar.
I mean,

1491
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:20,830
I own pills.
Give me an idea because I have very,

1492
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:21,664
I've got those,
like there's lovely $250 ducked down 

1493
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:25,300
pillows.
They're lovely.

1494
00:58:25,930 --> 00:58:26,763
But I live out of hotels.
I should start taking my own pillows 

1495
00:58:28,181 --> 00:58:29,014
everywhere.
It's not a bad idea because I sleep in 

1496
00:58:29,921 --> 00:58:31,750
my own bed about three days every two 
months.

1497
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:33,430
And it's,
it's like honestly,

1498
00:58:33,431 --> 00:58:37,120
it's like such a luxurious experience to
be at home watching that much.

1499
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:38,140
You know,
I live in hotels,

1500
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:39,340
I'm in,
I'm in,

1501
00:58:39,370 --> 00:58:40,960
I'm in a hotel in West Hollywood,
um,

1502
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:42,610
all this month.

1503
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:44,070
Uh,
yeah,

1504
00:58:44,090 --> 00:58:45,580
no,
I just don't go home anymore.

1505
00:58:45,850 --> 00:58:46,683
Well,
I know you're constantly doing these 

1506
00:58:47,651 --> 00:58:48,484
tours.
I saw the one that you did with Steven 

1507
00:58:50,051 --> 00:58:50,884
crowder and cause you know,
if Christina Hoff sommers showing the 

1508
00:58:53,951 --> 00:58:54,940
shirts,
she was amazing.

1509
00:58:54,970 --> 00:58:57,940
I loved that show.
I love her aside from mine.

1510
00:58:57,970 --> 00:58:59,450
That was my favorite show of yours.
Yeah,

1511
00:58:59,451 --> 00:59:01,090
she's fantastic.
She's fantastic.

1512
00:59:01,210 --> 00:59:02,043
And crowder gets a lot of shit,
but he makes some great points and he's 

1513
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:04,843
it.
He goes,

1514
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,470
well he's,
he kinda,

1515
00:59:06,570 --> 00:59:09,070
you know,
silly and he does a lot of funny stuff.

1516
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:11,380
I think he's funny.
You see the brexit thing that he did?

1517
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:12,840
No.
Oh,

1518
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:17,080
I always have to catch up on stuff like 
to see if you could find it when him and

1519
00:59:17,081 --> 00:59:18,590
his cohost,
uh,

1520
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:19,473
when uh,
what was the guy named Nigel Farrage 

1521
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:22,003
that his name?
The guy who orchestrated the brexit and 

1522
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:29,870
there's a video of him addressing,
I guess the parliament.

1523
00:59:29,910 --> 00:59:32,000
Is that what who is addressing oh,
European Parliament.

1524
00:59:32,001 --> 00:59:33,590
Yes.
Just roasting them.

1525
00:59:33,591 --> 00:59:34,424
Basically.
He's roasting them and then crowd here 

1526
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:38,690
go live.
Go full screen.

1527
00:59:38,691 --> 00:59:40,520
So we could,
but yeah,

1528
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:42,770
don't play it.
Go all the way back to the beginning.

1529
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,353
Hold on.

1530
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:48,620
This is what happen with brexit.
We just have to,

1531
00:59:48,650 --> 00:59:52,370
Nigel Faraj,
he's got a hat on who looks British,

1532
00:59:53,330 --> 00:59:55,250
very British.
And so it was a weird looking dude.

1533
00:59:55,251 --> 00:59:58,720
His cohosts looks like the Queen.
Finally he's going to hold their hand,

1534
00:59:58,890 --> 01:00:02,020
the referendum after the for the year.
It's very funny.

1535
01:00:02,050 --> 01:00:02,883
And indeed this has gone viral.
He explained in his words as to why the 

1536
01:00:08,811 --> 01:00:12,200
brexit happened and he sat down,
he educated them,

1537
01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:15,980
he tried to enlighten them.
Buddy also made it staying just a little

1538
01:00:15,981 --> 01:00:16,814
bit.
So we want to show you some highlights 

1539
01:00:17,481 --> 01:00:20,290
from these clips of Nigel.
Fuck Gosh,

1540
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:21,470
let's roll clip one.

1541
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,380
Isn't it funny?
You know what?

1542
01:00:23,381 --> 01:00:24,214
I came here 17 years ago and I said,
but I wanted to lead a campaign to get 

1543
01:00:29,741 --> 01:00:34,360
Britain to leave the European Union.
You all laughed at me.

1544
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:37,700
Well,
I have to say you're not laughing now,

1545
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:38,320
right?

1546
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:43,320
Oh,
this reminds me of a great,

1547
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,610
um,
can we pause this for a second?

1548
01:00:52,611 --> 01:00:54,350
Yes.
It reminds me of a great,

1549
01:00:54,351 --> 01:00:56,330
I think it's a monk monkhouse joke.
And he said,

1550
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:57,730
he said something like,
um,

1551
01:00:58,790 --> 01:01:00,400
10 years ago I told you I was all going 
to be,

1552
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:02,360
I told you all I was going to be a 
comedian.

1553
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:03,530
Well,
no one's laughing now.

1554
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:07,430
It gets crazy to watch.
They get,

1555
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:09,030
they go deeper.
Why is this?

1556
01:01:09,350 --> 01:01:11,090
Oh boom.
Love that.

1557
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:14,780
I don't care what you say about him,
but that man is a p.

1558
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,070
I.
M.

1559
01:01:16,070 --> 01:01:16,903
P.
Yes.

1560
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:19,490
Nobody's laughing now spelling that out 
in my head.

1561
01:01:19,590 --> 01:01:21,830
You expect this fragment to get better.
Don't,

1562
01:01:25,490 --> 01:01:26,323
like I said,
we're going to people who are far more 

1563
01:01:27,201 --> 01:01:28,034
authoritative on the brexit.
Just kind of like the UK with the 

1564
01:01:30,381 --> 01:01:31,790
American election.
It's entertainment.

1565
01:01:31,791 --> 01:01:32,810
Sorry,
it's been a,

1566
01:01:32,811 --> 01:01:33,644
it's been an intense few weeks.
This is last week of cultural 

1567
01:01:35,811 --> 01:01:36,644
appropriation.
Moms,

1568
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:38,900
brexit.
Good on you guys.

1569
01:01:38,901 --> 01:01:42,560
You got some independent chair going to 
be entertained this evening.

1570
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:43,753
Sons,

1571
01:01:45,770 --> 01:01:47,160
we have some other clips.
Don't we ask them a clip?

1572
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:49,190
We have some more clips where he sat 
down and he talked to them about,

1573
01:01:49,191 --> 01:01:51,560
uh,
I mean he just read them the riot act.

1574
01:01:51,561 --> 01:01:52,200
So let,
let's,

1575
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:53,033
let's,
let's get to some of the substance of 

1576
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:55,610
his,
his comments were all the next clip.

1577
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:56,673
But what I would like to see is a grown 
up and sensible attitude to how we 

1578
01:02:01,991 --> 01:02:06,991
negotiate a different relationship now.
Now I know,

1579
01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:12,940
I know that virtually none of you have 
ever done a proper job in your lives.

1580
01:02:13,290 --> 01:02:18,290
Oh,
okay.

1581
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:20,040
I get it.
No,

1582
01:02:20,390 --> 01:02:22,010
I,
I like Tim.

1583
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:25,100
He's right.
No,

1584
01:02:25,101 --> 01:02:25,934
he is.
That is a real issue with politicians 

1585
01:02:28,530 --> 01:02:33,350
and also university teachers of course.
Well it gets worse than that.

1586
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:36,570
Professors,
universities,

1587
01:02:36,571 --> 01:02:37,404
it's worse than that.
It used to be the case in America that 

1588
01:02:40,081 --> 01:02:42,870
the faculty ruled the roost and the 
faculty,

1589
01:02:42,871 --> 01:02:43,704
you know,
could pretty much do what they wanted 

1590
01:02:45,061 --> 01:02:45,894
and colleges.
But the balance of power has shifted in 

1591
01:02:47,071 --> 01:02:48,960
American universities now toward 
administrators.

1592
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:50,093
So what,
it basically the people who run the 

1593
01:02:50,521 --> 01:02:55,080
money because uh,
because universities are now giant,

1594
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:56,153
partly taxpayer funded,
partly government owned businesses that 

1595
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:03,910
need to bring in donations and need to,
uh,

1596
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:08,510
keep the admissions numbers up and have 
these gigantic campuses.

1597
01:03:08,511 --> 01:03:09,344
We'd luxurious facilities and all the 
rest of education is taking very much a 

1598
01:03:11,161 --> 01:03:11,994
back seat to the business of providing a
home or even as some people want a safe 

1599
01:03:16,021 --> 01:03:19,740
space away from home for four years and 
charging vast fees to do it.

1600
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:23,100
That becomes sort of holiday camps.
Very well appointed holiday camps.

1601
01:03:23,101 --> 01:03:25,800
The people with the power now in 
universities or the administrators.

1602
01:03:25,830 --> 01:03:26,663
And to be a university administrator,
you need to know even less than to be a 

1603
01:03:29,071 --> 01:03:30,420
professor.
You need to really,

1604
01:03:30,430 --> 01:03:31,081
I mean,
in fact,

1605
01:03:31,081 --> 01:03:31,914
it's almost compulsory to go through 
life with a cluster of conspiracy 

1606
01:03:34,411 --> 01:03:35,244
theories in a victimhood and grievance 
politics and total ignorance of history 

1607
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:39,463
to run a university in America now 
because you have to pander to and 

1608
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:45,210
believe a variety of things that simply 
aren't true.

1609
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:47,280
For example,
about campus rape culture.

1610
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:48,323
You need to not only enable but fund 
feminist groups on campus and all sorts 

1611
01:03:53,221 --> 01:03:55,730
of an a variety and the diversity office
and the women's,

1612
01:03:55,731 --> 01:03:56,564
you know,
in the women's studies department and 

1613
01:03:57,630 --> 01:03:58,463
this Obama,
all these things that are happening on 

1614
01:03:59,611 --> 01:04:00,540
campuses,
you know,

1615
01:04:00,541 --> 01:04:01,374
putting other kids tuition fees,
putting the tuition fees are people who 

1616
01:04:03,481 --> 01:04:04,314
are studying engineering and maths and 
physics into academic departments and 

1617
01:04:08,641 --> 01:04:09,474
student services and all sorts of other 
things that simply peddle lies to 

1618
01:04:12,931 --> 01:04:13,710
children.

1619
01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:14,543
They are spreading conspiracy theories 
based on shoddy advocacy research and 

1620
01:04:18,770 --> 01:04:19,603
um,
barmy social social science nonsense 

1621
01:04:22,621 --> 01:04:25,530
from the 1970s and filling it 
vulnerable,

1622
01:04:25,531 --> 01:04:26,970
impressionable young people's heads with
it.

1623
01:04:26,971 --> 01:04:29,400
And it is obscene.
Like what kind of conspiracy theory?

1624
01:04:29,850 --> 01:04:30,810
Well,
at the patriarchy,

1625
01:04:30,811 --> 01:04:33,210
the patriarch is a conspiracy theory.
The Patriarchy is the,

1626
01:04:33,211 --> 01:04:33,641
you know,
is,

1627
01:04:33,641 --> 01:04:35,730
is an idea of dreamt up by feminists,
which basic,

1628
01:04:35,731 --> 01:04:36,564
I mean,
what it really boils down to is my life 

1629
01:04:39,091 --> 01:04:40,360
is bad.
So this is the,

1630
01:04:40,361 --> 01:04:41,194
this is the thing that,
the thing I don't like about Bernie 

1631
01:04:41,911 --> 01:04:42,744
supporters,
they go to the world and they start on 

1632
01:04:44,461 --> 01:04:47,040
this basis.
It's my life's bad.

1633
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:48,113
Who's to blame for it?
Which of you are at fault for my life 

1634
01:04:51,181 --> 01:04:53,730
not being as good as I want it to be.
Now this is the,

1635
01:04:53,731 --> 01:04:55,590
the victim hood in grievance,
sort of politics of,

1636
01:04:55,630 --> 01:04:56,463
of the social justice left,
particularly then sort of middle and 

1637
01:04:57,871 --> 01:04:58,704
upper middle class social justice left.
Now these women's studies departments 

1638
01:05:01,051 --> 01:05:02,880
tell young girls if there's anything 
wrong in your life.

1639
01:05:02,881 --> 01:05:04,530
We were miserably unhappy and anything 
ever bad,

1640
01:05:04,590 --> 01:05:07,500
anything bad ever happens to you?
It is the patriarchy.

1641
01:05:07,650 --> 01:05:11,520
It's this sort of voldemort s conspiracy
theory that can explain everything.

1642
01:05:11,521 --> 01:05:12,354
And of course as anybody with any sense 
who actually reads books knows that any 

1643
01:05:14,701 --> 01:05:17,770
explanation that's a bit too good to be 
true generally is.

1644
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:21,070
And the Patriarchy in fact does not 
explain any of the things that are wrong

1645
01:05:21,071 --> 01:05:23,170
in women's lives.
And if you look at the real data,

1646
01:05:23,171 --> 01:05:24,820
you discover that if there is a 
patriarchy,

1647
01:05:24,850 --> 01:05:26,650
it ain't doing a very good job.
You know,

1648
01:05:26,651 --> 01:05:29,640
of course,
you know 97% of workplace fatalities are

1649
01:05:29,650 --> 01:05:31,750
male men have fallen behind in 
education.

1650
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:32,673
There is no wage gap.
And in fact women have a huge 

1651
01:05:34,601 --> 01:05:36,190
competitive advantage going for many 
jobs,

1652
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:36,791
blah,
blah,

1653
01:05:36,791 --> 01:05:38,440
blah.
Everyone who's listened to us regularly,

1654
01:05:38,441 --> 01:05:40,390
we'll know all this stuff by heart 
already,

1655
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:41,253
but let's explain the web get wage gap 
thing because it's one of the things 

1656
01:05:43,091 --> 01:05:44,530
that gets trumped,
trumpeted out,

1657
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:45,850
trumped,
trumpeted out,

1658
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:48,160
tried a bit from where,
where people don't,

1659
01:05:48,210 --> 01:05:50,790
I get a semi just at the sound of the 
word now you don't understand.

1660
01:05:50,810 --> 01:05:53,200
Told The New York Times I was trump 
sexual and I was trolling them,

1661
01:05:53,201 --> 01:05:55,420
but they saw that I was trolling them,
but they printed it.

1662
01:05:55,630 --> 01:05:58,120
Good job.
Recognize the troll.

1663
01:05:58,890 --> 01:05:59,723
And I think they did too.
But they are obligated to do you 

1664
01:06:01,370 --> 01:06:03,400
personally find Donald Trump sexual 
attraction on it?

1665
01:06:03,401 --> 01:06:04,510
Yeah,
I'm trump's actual,

1666
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:07,950
it's hilarious.
Yeah.

1667
01:06:08,070 --> 01:06:09,280
I don't think they know what to do with 
you,

1668
01:06:09,610 --> 01:06:10,443
but that's beside the point.
That's explained what the issue is with 

1669
01:06:13,451 --> 01:06:14,710
the wage gap.
Okay.

1670
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:16,940
So there's two ways to do it.
Um,

1671
01:06:16,990 --> 01:06:17,823
one of them involves a little bit of 
economics and people at home sometimes 

1672
01:06:19,811 --> 01:06:23,230
like Uconn deal,
but steals dirty math is what it is.

1673
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:25,180
They start taking you be checking on 
this,

1674
01:06:25,181 --> 01:06:26,580
but listen,
if you're at home and you're thinking,

1675
01:06:26,581 --> 01:06:27,414
I really can't be bothered with this 
buck the fuck up 75 cents to every 

1676
01:06:32,201 --> 01:06:34,150
dollar of lies,
lies,

1677
01:06:34,210 --> 01:06:35,043
lies.
So there are of course reasons why men 

1678
01:06:37,871 --> 01:06:40,990
and women may have different roles in 
society.

1679
01:06:40,991 --> 01:06:42,400
In some of these,
let's,

1680
01:06:42,401 --> 01:06:43,360
let's pick an example.

1681
01:06:43,630 --> 01:06:44,463
Mendham bear children.
Now of course the left is trying to 

1682
01:06:46,641 --> 01:06:47,021
check.
I saw,

1683
01:06:47,021 --> 01:06:48,430
Oh God,
sorry to go off track.

1684
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:49,960
This is how my brain works is I'm so 
scattered,

1685
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:51,113
but the Guardian in June,
I was just so this other story about 

1686
01:06:53,831 --> 01:06:54,664
this guy who was like,
try this trans guy trying to breastfeed 

1687
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:57,890
a kid.
And his quote was like,

1688
01:06:58,840 --> 01:06:59,710
children,
no,

1689
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:00,550
no,
it's not.

1690
01:07:00,551 --> 01:07:02,830
It's not children don't know what gender
you are.

1691
01:07:03,550 --> 01:07:04,383
I thought that was a joke.
I thought that was someone was like an 

1692
01:07:06,581 --> 01:07:07,970
onion type.
It's not,

1693
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:09,080
come on.
No,

1694
01:07:09,090 --> 01:07:11,660
it's the guy with glasses that has a 
baby on his tail.

1695
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:15,130
Oh No.
I started laughing when I saw that.

1696
01:07:15,131 --> 01:07:17,170
I thought it was like an almost 
certainly Canadian.

1697
01:07:19,630 --> 01:07:20,770
Do you know what?
I could look it up.

1698
01:07:20,830 --> 01:07:22,780
I would,
I wouldn't put a lot of money on it,

1699
01:07:22,781 --> 01:07:23,680
but I put a bit,
but let's,

1700
01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:25,540
let's get quickly.
Oh my God,

1701
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:26,374
this is real.
I'm a transgender dad in a gay 

1702
01:07:27,771 --> 01:07:30,450
relationship.
Who breastfeeds the Guardian.

1703
01:07:31,570 --> 01:07:32,890
This is real.
Yeah.

1704
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:35,410
Gay tranny breastfeeding the kid and he 
says,

1705
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:37,650
Hey,
kids didn't and what Jen d this is so at

1706
01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:39,250
the end of my pregnancy,
wait a minute,

1707
01:07:39,251 --> 01:07:40,084
wait a minute.
Wait,

1708
01:07:40,450 --> 01:07:41,650
wait and wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1709
01:07:42,130 --> 01:07:45,790
So he was born a woman then that it is a
woman who knows.

1710
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:47,710
Oh,
it's a woman who transgender man,

1711
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:53,080
cause he's got a mustache and a goatee,
which means hormones and is now becoming

1712
01:07:53,081 --> 01:07:53,831
a man.
Yeah.

1713
01:07:53,831 --> 01:07:56,170
So basically he's a man.
Breastfeeding a child.

1714
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:58,690
Kid is going to get like super 
testosterone,

1715
01:07:59,750 --> 01:08:03,440
which we're told that we're not allowing
female.

1716
01:08:03,730 --> 01:08:06,220
He's a man to demand where we have to do
this.

1717
01:08:06,220 --> 01:08:07,053
Now he is a man.
You can't even refer to him as a former 

1718
01:08:08,891 --> 01:08:09,611
female,
whatever,

1719
01:08:09,611 --> 01:08:12,610
that transphobic demand.
So I was right.

1720
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:16,190
I wasn't trans phobic is full,
big phobia means fear.

1721
01:08:16,390 --> 01:08:17,870
No.
Well irrational fear.

1722
01:08:17,930 --> 01:08:18,620
Yeah.
Um,

1723
01:08:18,620 --> 01:08:20,780
and there's nothing irrational about 
fearing trainees.

1724
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:24,880
They're fucking terrifying.
But I serious,

1725
01:08:25,130 --> 01:08:29,210
this is so scary.
I was on a chat show with somebody,

1726
01:08:29,211 --> 01:08:31,520
right?
And she's,

1727
01:08:31,550 --> 01:08:34,160
she was like this,
this man who is now a woman.

1728
01:08:34,550 --> 01:08:35,550
And she said,
um,

1729
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:37,370
I like icon.
She though lease,

1730
01:08:37,420 --> 01:08:39,170
you're doing the proper thing.
Dammit,

1731
01:08:39,230 --> 01:08:41,600
I'm going to get fired.
We have a company policy about this.

1732
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:43,630
And she said,
um,

1733
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:47,390
I've worn the female garb and I've worn 
the male garb.

1734
01:08:47,780 --> 01:08:49,760
Men Don't know they're born.
I get so many.

1735
01:08:49,780 --> 01:08:51,890
You know,
as I walked through life as a man,

1736
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:52,970
people treated me,
you know,

1737
01:08:52,971 --> 01:08:53,804
perfectly normally.
But now people look at me very 

1738
01:08:55,581 --> 01:08:56,120
strangely.

1739
01:08:56,120 --> 01:09:01,120
It took every ounce of my self control.
Not to say you're a man in a dress.

1740
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:02,353
Of course they look at you weirdly.
You're terrifying when babies cry at 

1741
01:09:05,931 --> 01:09:06,764
you.
They're not crying because they're 

1742
01:09:07,370 --> 01:09:08,203
transphobic.
They're crying because you look 

1743
01:09:09,081 --> 01:09:09,914
horrifying.
Did you see Caitlin Jenner or brew 

1744
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:14,420
install bruce?
No.

1745
01:09:14,490 --> 01:09:15,261
Bruce.
Wow.

1746
01:09:15,261 --> 01:09:19,360
How style at Breitbart is to insist on 
Bruce when ellen was grilling here,

1747
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:22,640
her,
him know about gay marriage.

1748
01:09:22,850 --> 01:09:24,920
And then she was saying she's a 
traditionalist.

1749
01:09:25,070 --> 01:09:25,730
Yeah,
yeah,

1750
01:09:25,730 --> 01:09:26,563
yeah.
But that's why the missional girl 

1751
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:33,890
fucking rubber face or face can't move.
She shouted up full of Botox.

1752
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:35,033
What the fuck?
What the fuck ever happened to loving 

1753
01:09:37,101 --> 01:09:39,500
yourself?
That's what confuses the shit out of me.

1754
01:09:39,660 --> 01:09:40,493
I'm telling you,
it's self harm extended out into the 

1755
01:09:41,721 --> 01:09:42,554
rest of your life because you didn't 
pick up a razor blade when you were 15 

1756
01:09:44,690 --> 01:09:46,200
honestly,
kids cut yourself.

1757
01:09:46,230 --> 01:09:46,551
No,
I'm kidding.

1758
01:09:46,551 --> 01:09:49,820
I don't know that that's what it is.
But there's something very bizarre about

1759
01:09:49,830 --> 01:09:50,663
in collage exoticness hormones into 
their body and getting their chin 

1760
01:09:55,041 --> 01:09:57,950
slashed off so that they look more like 
a man or a woman.

1761
01:09:57,980 --> 01:09:58,813
I very firmly believe,
very firmly believe that we will look 

1762
01:10:02,781 --> 01:10:03,614
back on this period in time like we do 
now on Victorian electroshock therapy 

1763
01:10:07,161 --> 01:10:11,960
and wonder how we could ever have been 
so monstrously callous as to allow these

1764
01:10:11,961 --> 01:10:15,320
people who have mental mental illnesses 
to mutilate their bodies.

1765
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:20,560
And of course how idiotic and and and 
authoritarian it was of us to expect the

1766
01:10:21,921 --> 01:10:22,754
taxpayers to pick up the bill.
That's what that gets really weird for 

1767
01:10:24,891 --> 01:10:25,670
sure.
But I mean,

1768
01:10:25,670 --> 01:10:28,610
I feel like if somebody wants to do it 
and it's their body,

1769
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:31,280
I have no right whatsoever to tell them 
they can't do.

1770
01:10:31,281 --> 01:10:32,000
Oh,
you do.

1771
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,220
But it is very,
you do is you should,

1772
01:10:34,910 --> 01:10:39,910
why should I be so stupid?
My God?

1773
01:10:40,610 --> 01:10:42,710
Anybody be able to tell?
Just let it do it.

1774
01:10:42,711 --> 01:10:43,670
I mean,
who cares,

1775
01:10:43,671 --> 01:10:44,504
right?
Yeah.

1776
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:45,753
Well,
why not?

1777
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:51,890
We don't allow people with mental 
illnesses on the whole to live out their

1778
01:10:51,891 --> 01:10:54,140
delusions excepted when it isn't a 
medical interest.

1779
01:10:54,141 --> 01:10:56,570
When we do what is mental illness?
Okay.

1780
01:10:56,571 --> 01:10:59,030
Let me ask you this.
If a person's pays their bills,

1781
01:10:59,031 --> 01:11:00,920
they're nice to people.
They functioned normally,

1782
01:11:00,940 --> 01:11:03,180
they pay their taxes and for whatever 
man,

1783
01:11:03,530 --> 01:11:07,310
they want to be a man to man,
but they want to be one tough.

1784
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:11,300
You know what?
This is a serious answer to this,

1785
01:11:11,301 --> 01:11:14,100
which is that it is by no clear,

1786
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:16,170
and you wouldn't know this just by 
reading the media,

1787
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:17,273
but it is by no means clear that that is
the most effective and humane treatment 

1788
01:11:20,161 --> 01:11:22,070
pathway for people with this particular 
group.

1789
01:11:22,150 --> 01:11:24,270
Right?
Greed is not clear at all.

1790
01:11:24,510 --> 01:11:25,343
Now what we should be doing,
unless you just want some sort of 

1791
01:11:28,021 --> 01:11:28,831
chaotic,
chaotic,

1792
01:11:28,831 --> 01:11:29,340
free for,
I know,

1793
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:30,430
I know.
The easy argument,

1794
01:11:30,431 --> 01:11:31,264
that easy libertarian argument is let 
people do what they want themselves to 

1795
01:11:33,291 --> 01:11:35,250
not hurting anybody else.
Just don't make the taxpayer pay for it.

1796
01:11:35,251 --> 01:11:35,941
Right?
Well,

1797
01:11:35,941 --> 01:11:36,774
yeah,
fine.

1798
01:11:36,780 --> 01:11:38,400
But my natural,
I mean,

1799
01:11:38,401 --> 01:11:42,450
I think my compassion kicks in at that 
point and says to me,

1800
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:47,250
do we want to allow people who are 
mentally ill to mutilate themselves?

1801
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:49,010
If somebody was,
uh,

1802
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:50,153
a schizophrenia,
would we give them the razor blade 

1803
01:11:51,841 --> 01:11:53,850
they're asking for because they want to 
hack off their own arm.

1804
01:11:53,851 --> 01:11:55,650
Okay,
what do we would know what size?

1805
01:11:55,650 --> 01:11:58,990
Double e tits.
And they've got just,

1806
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:02,760
just good Kukoc could sense that's all 
would have a girl.

1807
01:12:02,761 --> 01:12:04,950
Gastric surgery is different.
Hosters tips,

1808
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:06,900
plastic surgery.
It's just plus.

1809
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:08,033
Well that's,
that's tending into the same kind of 

1810
01:12:09,181 --> 01:12:11,130
disorder and we shouldn't let them do 
that either.

1811
01:12:11,131 --> 01:12:12,510
Maybe there should be rules about 
what's,

1812
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:13,410
how big,
you can go.

1813
01:12:13,710 --> 01:12:16,320
A little plastic,
a little bit tit rules in this country.

1814
01:12:16,350 --> 01:12:18,390
A little plastic surgery is just good 
grooming.

1815
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:19,680
But,
um,

1816
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:20,311
I,
you know,

1817
01:12:20,311 --> 01:12:20,781
I mean,
I,

1818
01:12:20,781 --> 01:12:22,920
I,
I couldn't imagine a day,

1819
01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:24,840
oh sure.
We have tit rules.

1820
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:26,110
Imagine Day.
Well,

1821
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:27,330
no,
it's not about the site a,

1822
01:12:27,331 --> 01:12:28,680
okay.
It's not about the size of the breast.

1823
01:12:28,681 --> 01:12:31,890
It's about the mental state of the 
person who wants to change their body.

1824
01:12:31,891 --> 01:12:36,140
And that's flubs preposterous.
Jessica Rabbit tits.

1825
01:12:36,370 --> 01:12:39,480
If they want to pay for them themselves 
and themselves,

1826
01:12:39,610 --> 01:12:41,580
I don't know.
I mean if they,

1827
01:12:41,581 --> 01:12:42,414
you know,
if they want like pendulous breasts and 

1828
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:47,520
size of watermelon show sideshow,
no,

1829
01:12:47,521 --> 01:12:48,600
I don't think you should be able to do 
that.

1830
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:51,810
It's because it's awful.
Okay.

1831
01:12:51,870 --> 01:12:53,520
Should you be able to tattoo your whole 
body?

1832
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:56,160
Well,
it depends.

1833
01:12:56,310 --> 01:12:58,560
If you're like my arm.
Totally tattooed.

1834
01:12:58,800 --> 01:12:59,550
Yeah,
it was pretty hot.

1835
01:12:59,550 --> 01:13:00,770
Is that a yeah,
you should be allowed,

1836
01:13:00,771 --> 01:13:03,900
but you should be allowed because it's 
hot to you.

1837
01:13:04,290 --> 01:13:06,060
But some people don't like it.
Well,

1838
01:13:06,061 --> 01:13:08,130
they're wrong.
Well isn't that subjective?

1839
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:09,350
But yeah,
the woman.

1840
01:13:09,390 --> 01:13:12,330
Shouldn't those giant boulder tits be 
subjective as well?

1841
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:15,330
When the girls get those big thick blue 
veins,

1842
01:13:15,510 --> 01:13:17,580
those are bizarre.
Those neck veins big.

1843
01:13:17,581 --> 01:13:20,070
Do you like your tits?
I like normal ones.

1844
01:13:20,670 --> 01:13:22,980
See Cup's fine.
Show me what's so,

1845
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:25,440
you know.
Okay,

1846
01:13:25,441 --> 01:13:29,310
so like this dee dee's a little,
I'm not a connoisseur resists,

1847
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:32,550
so I don't know what cops is that it's 
like a C Cup.

1848
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:33,450
Yeah.
Yeah.

1849
01:13:33,451 --> 01:13:34,284
That's nice.
So breast?

1850
01:13:34,290 --> 01:13:35,010
Yes.
Yeah,

1851
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:36,060
look good.
Yeah.

1852
01:13:36,770 --> 01:13:37,603
Yeah.
But you shouldn't get them if you're a 

1853
01:13:38,221 --> 01:13:38,820
man.

1854
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:39,750
Yeah.
Well,

1855
01:13:39,751 --> 01:13:40,740
yeah.
Well Bruce has him,

1856
01:13:40,741 --> 01:13:41,940
right?
He has them now.

1857
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:42,841
Yeah.
Yeah.

1858
01:13:42,841 --> 01:13:47,610
That was the things about him as he went
on the Diane Sawyer thing and said,

1859
01:13:47,611 --> 01:13:50,270
he still wants to be,
bruce still wants to be a him stolen.

1860
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:53,250
So we called to him and then immediately
after,

1861
01:13:53,251 --> 01:13:56,340
because of all the attention gets his 
jaw shave down,

1862
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:59,640
has massive facial reconstruction 
surgery.

1863
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:00,713
I mean it was like,
it was instantaneously and changed his 

1864
01:14:02,791 --> 01:14:03,624
name to Caitlyn and it was also right 
after the Diane Sawyer injury or injury 

1865
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:10,583
interview that he plowed into that lady 
and center into oncoming traffic and 

1866
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:15,310
killed her.
And it was,

1867
01:14:16,730 --> 01:14:17,860
it is.
So he was,

1868
01:14:17,861 --> 01:14:19,420
he was that he was going to get 
discussed.

1869
01:14:19,421 --> 01:14:21,430
I think he was.
He was declared innocent of that.

1870
01:14:22,570 --> 01:14:24,160
What do you mean declared innocent?
Wasn't,

1871
01:14:24,161 --> 01:14:27,160
he definitely wasn't the car,
wasn't he acquitted of manslaughter?

1872
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:28,113
Yes,
but I mean he's definitely taken us 

1873
01:14:30,190 --> 01:14:32,290
being careless.
Definitely hit that car.

1874
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:34,780
But of course he's insane.
He's insane.

1875
01:14:34,781 --> 01:14:35,980
He shouldn't be allowed behind the 
wheel.

1876
01:14:35,981 --> 01:14:36,814
He shouldn't be given guns.
He should not be given access to 

1877
01:14:38,231 --> 01:14:39,064
surgeons struggling with the office face
to try to make sounds with his mouth or 

1878
01:14:46,511 --> 01:14:50,390
her mouth or would it look at this?
Have you,

1879
01:14:51,340 --> 01:14:52,600
it's quite good in that dress frankly.
But,

1880
01:14:52,940 --> 01:14:56,560
uh,
that is that this is,

1881
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:57,491
this is,
you know,

1882
01:14:57,491 --> 01:14:58,870
this is,
this is an insane person.

1883
01:14:59,050 --> 01:15:02,290
This is a person whose mind is he needs 
therapy and well,

1884
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:03,153
that's a person who grew up with uh,
well existed with a bunch of incredibly 

1885
01:15:07,271 --> 01:15:08,104
famous,
very powerful women and probably 

1886
01:15:09,851 --> 01:15:12,140
secretly wanted to be like that.
One of them.

1887
01:15:13,070 --> 01:15:16,030
Look,
all I'm saying for sure for sure outside

1888
01:15:16,031 --> 01:15:16,900
of our,
you know,

1889
01:15:17,170 --> 01:15:18,003
joking around is that it is by no means 
clear that transition surgery is the 

1890
01:15:21,131 --> 01:15:22,240
best route for these people.

1891
01:15:22,270 --> 01:15:24,640
It does not,
according to all of the data we have,

1892
01:15:24,670 --> 01:15:25,503
all of the studies that it does not 
significantly or at all really affects 

1893
01:15:29,261 --> 01:15:30,094
suicide rates or depression.
What people who've had this surgery do 

1894
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:33,780
not get better,
uh,

1895
01:15:33,950 --> 01:15:36,520
as possible.
A few of them do,

1896
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:37,383
but not many.
And 40% of them who have it want it 

1897
01:15:40,540 --> 01:15:41,373
reversed.
My suggestion is shouldn't we just be a 

1898
01:15:43,391 --> 01:15:44,950
bit more cautious about it?
Well,

1899
01:15:44,951 --> 01:15:45,784
you are certainly saying some very uh,
conservative things about that in terms 

1900
01:15:51,251 --> 01:15:53,800
of like how you should approach your own
body and your life,

1901
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:56,330
like getting sexual reassignment.
Nobody,

1902
01:15:56,370 --> 01:15:56,800
I mean,
I don't want,

1903
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:59,860
you mean conservative like right wing.
I mean like cautious,

1904
01:16:00,190 --> 01:16:01,023
cautious.
I think we should be cautious before we 

1905
01:16:02,171 --> 01:16:03,004
moved to they,
our bodies because there's no coming 

1906
01:16:03,851 --> 01:16:04,684
back from it.
And there's a lot of regret once you've 

1907
01:16:06,791 --> 01:16:07,600
cut your cock off.

1908
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:08,510
That's it.
Yeah,

1909
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:09,363
that's it.
Everything else in life you can reverse 

1910
01:16:10,810 --> 01:16:14,060
your reputation.
You can restore within the hard work and

1911
01:16:14,230 --> 01:16:14,850
you know,
and,

1912
01:16:14,850 --> 01:16:15,683
and a commitment to read it to 
redressing whatever wrongs you did to 

1913
01:16:18,311 --> 01:16:19,870
people.
You Korea,

1914
01:16:19,871 --> 01:16:22,960
you can make it better.
You can fix almost anything in life.

1915
01:16:23,290 --> 01:16:24,123
But you cut your genitals off.
Biological reality is biological 

1916
01:16:26,651 --> 01:16:27,251
reality,
right?

1917
01:16:27,251 --> 01:16:29,040
And you can fix almost anything else 
about yourself,

1918
01:16:29,050 --> 01:16:32,590
almost anything else about your life.
But there are certain facts,

1919
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:35,950
certain anatomical facts about,
about men and women.

1920
01:16:35,951 --> 01:16:37,810
And once you cut that thing off,
that's it.

1921
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:39,273
It's done.
And I'm just suggesting that maybe we 

1922
01:16:41,231 --> 01:16:42,670
shouldn't do it,
for instance,

1923
01:16:42,730 --> 01:16:45,430
to children for start giving them 
hormone therapy.

1924
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:48,910
We shouldn't allow people that should be
just standard.

1925
01:16:48,940 --> 01:16:50,860
There's no way.
What if but yeah,

1926
01:16:50,870 --> 01:16:53,630
but I'm saying shit,
what if somebody with 1819 you know,

1927
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:54,753
1819 years old and says,
I know and have known for 10 years that 

1928
01:16:56,951 --> 01:16:57,910
I'm a woman.
You know,

1929
01:16:57,911 --> 01:17:00,940
would you let them change and stuff?
I thought I wanted to be married.

1930
01:17:01,090 --> 01:17:03,970
You'll frontal lobe isn't even fully 
formed at that age.

1931
01:17:04,330 --> 01:17:05,163
You're not even really a person yet.
You know you are and you are a a 

1932
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:11,530
burgeoning person,
right?

1933
01:17:11,810 --> 01:17:15,500
You are growing into the person you will
be and that's why you can abort them.

1934
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:20,800
Stop it.
They're not really people yet.

1935
01:17:21,250 --> 01:17:23,690
Stop it.
Stop it.

1936
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:27,110
This level of software story has been a 
few.

1937
01:17:29,030 --> 01:17:31,680
So you might be 800 plus podcasts 
guests.

1938
01:17:31,690 --> 01:17:32,523
The first is someone said Sophos tree.
This is unless you said it during the 

1939
01:17:34,751 --> 01:17:36,240
last episode.
Sophos stream.

1940
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:39,490
This is the,
this is this.

1941
01:17:39,491 --> 01:17:41,320
So it's the headline on Breitbart 
tomorrow.

1942
01:17:41,321 --> 01:17:44,690
Joe Rogan in favor of 18 year old 
abortions or abortion.

1943
01:17:44,890 --> 01:17:47,680
How many weeks is that?
How many weeks is 18 years?

1944
01:17:47,681 --> 01:17:48,940
That's a lot.
I'm bad at math.

1945
01:17:49,290 --> 01:17:50,320
My issue is,

1946
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:56,490
wasn't there a time where we said you 
should just love who you are,

1947
01:17:56,850 --> 01:17:59,810
like love who you are and if you can,
these people do who you are.

1948
01:18:00,270 --> 01:18:04,920
But there's the big difference between x
sort of accepting who you are.

1949
01:18:04,921 --> 01:18:07,440
And there's some people that just have 
unfortunate genetics,

1950
01:18:07,441 --> 01:18:09,690
right?
And there's some people that may be wish

1951
01:18:09,691 --> 01:18:10,524
of,
they're a woman or made me wish there 

1952
01:18:11,131 --> 01:18:13,020
was something else.
And there's one thing between,

1953
01:18:13,290 --> 01:18:17,070
there's a difference between dressing up
or pretending,

1954
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:18,113
but once you start getting into full on 
injecting female hormones into a male's 

1955
01:18:23,131 --> 01:18:26,370
body and changing things,
and then physical surgery,

1956
01:18:26,670 --> 01:18:29,250
I am not against it.
I think I am.

1957
01:18:29,310 --> 01:18:31,110
Like you said,
I'm silly libertarian.

1958
01:18:31,111 --> 01:18:31,944
I feel like you should be able to do 
whatever the fuck you want to do with 

1959
01:18:33,901 --> 01:18:37,170
your body.
But it is a very dangerous road.

1960
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:38,273
And there's there,
there is a host of different people out 

1961
01:18:41,461 --> 01:18:43,590
there that will tell you that they've 
done it.

1962
01:18:43,620 --> 01:18:45,510
And it was a huge,
it was a huge mistake.

1963
01:18:45,930 --> 01:18:47,430
Yes,
they're all 40% of,

1964
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:48,273
but no one has to address that.
That is something that the left never 

1965
01:18:50,221 --> 01:18:53,400
wants to address in their embracing of 
the transgender culture,

1966
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:56,280
which I embrace to do whatever the fuck 
you want to do.

1967
01:18:56,281 --> 01:18:57,060
I'll say it again.

1968
01:18:57,060 --> 01:18:57,521
Yeah.
No,

1969
01:18:57,521 --> 01:18:59,490
I like,
I just can't get behind it because I see

1970
01:18:59,491 --> 01:19:01,830
how,
isn't it dishonest though too?

1971
01:19:01,831 --> 01:19:03,960
Never discussed those people that were 
crucified is,

1972
01:19:03,961 --> 01:19:04,771
but for them,
look,

1973
01:19:04,771 --> 01:19:07,920
they forced us to take a moral position 
on a medical issue,

1974
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:09,690
right?
This is not a moral issue.

1975
01:19:09,691 --> 01:19:10,524
This is a medical issue.
If it is the case that people have a 

1976
01:19:13,501 --> 01:19:16,640
disorder or a condition,
if they have dysphoria,

1977
01:19:16,650 --> 01:19:18,240
whatever word they want to come up with 
for it,

1978
01:19:18,540 --> 01:19:21,990
that means that they were born with the 
wrong brain in the wrong body.

1979
01:19:22,290 --> 01:19:24,510
Nevermind the fact that we're always 
told that gender socialized,

1980
01:19:24,511 --> 01:19:25,770
you know,
or can apparently suddenly,

1981
01:19:25,771 --> 01:19:26,604
abruptly.
Now you can have a male brain such a 

1982
01:19:28,051 --> 01:19:28,884
thing as a male brain and the leftist 
gender as a social construct and last 

1983
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:34,590
year trends,
in which case you've got a male brain of

1984
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:36,000
everybody.
What a load of crap.

1985
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,920
These people,
these people really expect us to believe

1986
01:19:37,921 --> 01:19:38,754
this shit.
They think that we have the same level 

1987
01:19:40,381 --> 01:19:41,214
of cognitive dissonance that they have.
They think that we are as dumb as they 

1988
01:19:43,621 --> 01:19:44,454
are.
They think that we don't think things 

1989
01:19:45,211 --> 01:19:47,850
through like they don't think things 
through what we do.

1990
01:19:47,970 --> 01:19:48,803
We do think these things through.
And so to most people that are home and 

1991
01:19:50,941 --> 01:19:51,774
they are like told on the one hand if 
they even bother to get this far into a 

1992
01:19:54,241 --> 01:19:55,074
guardian editorial,
that you know that gender is a social 

1993
01:19:57,121 --> 01:19:57,954
construct and you know all of this kind 
of stuff and yet at the same time that 

1994
01:20:00,271 --> 01:20:01,104
masculinity is toxic and at the same 
time you can have a mat and the only 

1995
01:20:05,851 --> 01:20:08,340
time you were allowed to feminine

1996
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:11,820
virtue,
like really like sexy clothes,

1997
01:20:11,821 --> 01:20:14,180
short skirts as if you're chasing a 
trend.

1998
01:20:14,270 --> 01:20:17,900
And if you're a trainee,
if you're a girl,

1999
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:19,860
yeah.
It's like,

2000
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:20,890
Oh,
you're so empowered.

2001
01:20:20,930 --> 01:20:21,763
You're brave and fabulous.
Like a stunning and brave is the phrase 

2002
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:25,403
stunning and brave.
There's nothing heroic about cutting 

2003
01:20:29,581 --> 01:20:34,110
off.
Your firefighter should get the pump off

2004
01:20:34,170 --> 01:20:36,090
and cutting their cocks off.
You know,

2005
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:41,250
it's just strange that a woman who wears
short skirts and high heels and a lot of

2006
01:20:41,251 --> 01:20:44,100
makeup,
that is a pay as long as you're a man,

2007
01:20:44,140 --> 01:20:45,660
right?
As long as you're a married man,

2008
01:20:45,690 --> 01:20:49,950
you see where even better at being women
than women or women on deer.

2009
01:20:50,310 --> 01:20:51,960
Yeah.
With Glamour magazine,

2010
01:20:51,970 --> 01:20:54,480
woman of the year,
six months after being a woman,

2011
01:20:54,481 --> 01:20:55,314
he one woman of the year,
if there's bitches had been trying to 

2012
01:20:57,001 --> 01:21:00,750
win that fucking award for this 30 40 
years of good ladies out there.

2013
01:21:00,750 --> 01:21:03,090
There's some good girls who missed out 
on that.

2014
01:21:03,450 --> 01:21:05,400
Is there anything men can't do?
We're better.

2015
01:21:05,810 --> 01:21:06,643
You know,
I've had male cleaners and female 

2016
01:21:07,501 --> 01:21:08,820
cleanest men.
Always better.

2017
01:21:08,821 --> 01:21:11,640
I've had male cooks and female coaches.
Male cooks always better.

2018
01:21:12,370 --> 01:21:13,770
I'm just saying,
what do I mean?

2019
01:21:13,771 --> 01:21:14,604
This is the problem with a trans project
is profoundly sexist because you know 

2020
01:21:17,130 --> 01:21:18,570
the transplant and homophobic,
by the way,

2021
01:21:18,571 --> 01:21:19,404
because I've convinced to this,
the transport is profoundly homophobia 

2022
01:21:22,121 --> 01:21:23,670
because what it's telling parents right 
now,

2023
01:21:23,671 --> 01:21:25,670
and this is,
this is the 40% of the one at route when

2024
01:21:25,671 --> 01:21:28,170
it reversed,
and probably then some they're telling,

2025
01:21:28,171 --> 01:21:29,004
if you're a young boy and your feminine 
and you liked playing with barbies and 

2026
01:21:31,261 --> 01:21:34,710
you're attracted to other boys and you,
and in your confused child,

2027
01:21:34,711 --> 01:21:37,290
mind you,
you and your parents,

2028
01:21:37,350 --> 01:21:38,670
dumb,
liberal,

2029
01:21:39,330 --> 01:21:40,770
infested,
infected,

2030
01:21:40,771 --> 01:21:43,830
intoxicated mind.
Somehow this becomes,

2031
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:45,173
oh,
you must have really supposed to have 

2032
01:21:46,381 --> 01:21:47,430
been a girl.

2033
01:21:47,620 --> 01:21:48,690
Uh,
no,

2034
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:51,990
they're just gay.
And if you leave these kids alone,

2035
01:21:52,020 --> 01:21:52,853
all the evidence suggests that they grew
up into perfectly well adjusted young 

2036
01:21:54,961 --> 01:21:57,030
gay men.
But instead we're telling them,

2037
01:21:57,031 --> 01:21:57,864
and is this also provides an escape 
hatch for parents who can't cope with 

2038
01:22:00,601 --> 01:22:01,590
it.
The fact that kids are gay,

2039
01:22:01,830 --> 01:22:03,630
because what it says to them is,
oh,

2040
01:22:03,631 --> 01:22:06,240
it's okay.
You haven't given birth to a queer.

2041
01:22:06,570 --> 01:22:07,131
You've just,
you,

2042
01:22:07,131 --> 01:22:09,210
there's nothing wrong with you.
This kid's got a disorder,

2043
01:22:09,211 --> 01:22:10,044
you should have had a daughter.
So this gets parents out of having to 

2044
01:22:12,690 --> 01:22:13,523
like go through the,
all of the difficult a rigmarole on 

2045
01:22:15,031 --> 01:22:16,980
their heads.
Like what did I do to turn my son gay?

2046
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:17,993
Well now you don't have to because now 
they have a disorder and now they're 

2047
01:22:19,771 --> 01:22:20,820
supposed to be girls.
Right.

2048
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:26,030
That's so homophobic.
So homophobic and the trends thing is,

2049
01:22:26,130 --> 01:22:28,850
is profoundly anti women because all it 
seems to be demonstrating,

2050
01:22:28,870 --> 01:22:29,703
and I mean the effect of it,
at least all it seems to be 

2051
01:22:30,811 --> 01:22:33,000
demonstrating is that men are better at 
being women than women are.

2052
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:33,833
And I no,
I mean look at Caitlyn Jenner woman of 

2053
01:22:38,341 --> 01:22:39,700
the year.
We didn't do it.

2054
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:44,830
It's bullshit award just because there's
so much attention being put on a,

2055
01:22:45,391 --> 01:22:47,430
no one really thinks she did anything 
fabulous.

2056
01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:47,821
Well,
no,

2057
01:22:47,821 --> 01:22:50,790
this isn't about all the women that have
done amazing things for women.

2058
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:53,030
This is what the left does is it forces 
you to take it.

2059
01:22:53,031 --> 01:22:53,864
Yes it is.
It forces you to take moral positions 

2060
01:22:55,890 --> 01:22:56,850
on,
you know,

2061
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:59,010
on medical issues in this case.
Right.

2062
01:22:59,190 --> 01:23:00,023
But it also makes you lie.
This is how you know the left thinks 

2063
01:23:01,771 --> 01:23:03,270
it's one and it's getting over 
confident,

2064
01:23:03,271 --> 01:23:04,104
which is why I'm winning on college 
campuses because they've forgotten how 

2065
01:23:05,171 --> 01:23:06,004
to argue.
But the left is getting over at comp 

2066
01:23:07,630 --> 01:23:11,860
overconfident and he's making it is it's
enforcing this stuff when people now,

2067
01:23:12,130 --> 01:23:12,963
if you don't want to be a bigot and lose
your job and liberal newspaper column 

2068
01:23:14,711 --> 01:23:17,200
and not be appear on TV anymore and 
become persona non grata,

2069
01:23:17,350 --> 01:23:19,480
you have to tell lies that you know 
aren't true,

2070
01:23:19,481 --> 01:23:20,440
that everybody knows aren't true.

2071
01:23:20,470 --> 01:23:21,880
For instance,
the Caitlyn Jenner was a woman.

2072
01:23:21,970 --> 01:23:24,980
Nobody believes that no one,
not the journalist who I,

2073
01:23:25,050 --> 01:23:26,560
he still has a penis,
not,

2074
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:27,131
well,
okay,

2075
01:23:27,131 --> 01:23:27,964
fine.
But let's say it's even more 

2076
01:23:28,451 --> 01:23:30,660
problematic.
Like she's offensive.

2077
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:34,000
I'll give you that problematic that 
let's take another trans person,

2078
01:23:34,001 --> 01:23:35,200
right?
Somebody who's had everything.

2079
01:23:35,201 --> 01:23:37,270
Somebody who now has one of those 
hideous,

2080
01:23:38,170 --> 01:23:40,750
oozing inverted vaginas.
You know,

2081
01:23:40,751 --> 01:23:41,584
the surgery is terrific by the way.
I describe it in detail to anybody 

2082
01:23:43,781 --> 01:23:46,000
thinking of having this done to them on 
youtube.

2083
01:23:46,060 --> 01:23:46,840
Oh God,
really?

2084
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:47,231
Yeah.
Oh,

2085
01:23:47,231 --> 01:23:48,420
even I haven't done that.
Can Watch it.

2086
01:23:48,610 --> 01:23:49,990
No thanks.
Uh,

2087
01:23:50,670 --> 01:23:51,530
it,
you know,

2088
01:23:52,150 --> 01:23:54,400
take a take a woman who has had all of 
this,

2089
01:23:54,420 --> 01:23:55,253
okay.
She's had all the surgery or the woman 

2090
01:23:56,671 --> 01:23:58,480
is living as a woman could almost pass 
or does it?

2091
01:23:58,810 --> 01:24:02,050
Nobody believes it's a woman,
not the journalist writing the stories,

2092
01:24:03,510 --> 01:24:04,343
not the doc.

2093
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:07,310
Stop it.
Stop it.

2094
01:24:07,420 --> 01:24:08,051
Oh,
do you know,

2095
01:24:08,051 --> 01:24:08,884
interesting little tidbit.
I think I might even have said this in 

2096
01:24:10,121 --> 01:24:10,954
the last show.
It was a long time ago and I'm sure 

2097
01:24:11,471 --> 01:24:12,304
different people are listening.
Do you know why so many trainings get 

2098
01:24:15,161 --> 01:24:15,781
beaten up?
Cause the,

2099
01:24:15,781 --> 01:24:16,720
the left is always saying,
oh,

2100
01:24:16,721 --> 01:24:17,554
we gotta protect the Trans Community 
because there's like disproportionately 

2101
01:24:18,821 --> 01:24:19,840
the victims of violence,
you know?

2102
01:24:19,870 --> 01:24:21,990
Do you know what happens?
Why?

2103
01:24:22,010 --> 01:24:22,843
No.
Why tranny prostitutes get beaten up so 

2104
01:24:24,671 --> 01:24:25,480
much.
Why?

2105
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:26,313
Yes.
Because they lie and say that they're a 

2106
01:24:28,631 --> 01:24:31,210
woman and the guy finds a penis and then
they'd beat him up.

2107
01:24:31,270 --> 01:24:33,070
No,
they steal money.

2108
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:37,540
No,
they what did the first one that gave us

2109
01:24:37,541 --> 01:24:39,250
a much obvious explanation,
but it isn't the reason.

2110
01:24:39,940 --> 01:24:40,773
What happens is that,
I mean men aren't dumb when they see a 

2111
01:24:42,971 --> 01:24:44,500
trainee.
They know it's a tranny,

2112
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:47,280
right?
I don't know who these guys are like in,

2113
01:24:47,281 --> 01:24:50,440
in your imagination who you think don't 
know a man when they see one.

2114
01:24:50,530 --> 01:24:52,480
But most people know a man when they see
one,

2115
01:24:52,510 --> 01:24:54,540
even if it's at hormones and it's got 
like a,

2116
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:57,260
I've seen some close ones.
I've seen some ones.

2117
01:24:57,790 --> 01:25:00,820
I've seen someone that you've ever seen.
Bailey J no belly.

2118
01:25:00,821 --> 01:25:01,654
J transgender woman.
She is the most compelling argument for 

2119
01:25:04,691 --> 01:25:07,030
someone who was born in the wrong sex.
Well,

2120
01:25:07,031 --> 01:25:10,020
I don't think hotness is a compelling 
argument for medical,

2121
01:25:10,030 --> 01:25:13,630
like 100% 100% well,
lots of men are pretty,

2122
01:25:13,631 --> 01:25:14,860
that's not,
she's got a big Dick.

2123
01:25:16,090 --> 01:25:17,610
There's better pictures of her.
No,

2124
01:25:18,110 --> 01:25:19,690
I'm not into it.
That right there.

2125
01:25:19,750 --> 01:25:20,583
Kapow come on son.
Not into a big fat dick to post it on 

2126
01:25:23,681 --> 01:25:24,514
twitter.
That's one of the weird things about 

2127
01:25:25,151 --> 01:25:27,040
twitter.
Like you can be flipping through twitter

2128
01:25:27,041 --> 01:25:28,600
and all of a sudden you just see a giant
Dick.

2129
01:25:28,601 --> 01:25:28,991
You're like,
oh,

2130
01:25:28,991 --> 01:25:29,824
all right,
well I follow a couple of porn stars 

2131
01:25:30,851 --> 01:25:32,020
because I'm friends with them.

2132
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:33,153
But if it was a bit,
of course they use the twitter accounts 

2133
01:25:34,991 --> 01:25:36,700
just to promote their work.
So I'm sort of like,

2134
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:37,960
I've got like one,
no,

2135
01:25:37,961 --> 01:25:41,620
I've got like Felix Salmon from fusion,
somebody from the Wall Street Journal,

2136
01:25:41,830 --> 01:25:46,360
a colleague tweeting about Elon Musk,
tranny porn.

2137
01:25:46,460 --> 01:25:48,460
It was all the time after time.
Uh,

2138
01:25:48,461 --> 01:25:49,530
what was I saying?
Yes.

2139
01:25:49,630 --> 01:25:52,360
Nobody,
nobody believes no one,

2140
01:25:52,750 --> 01:25:53,583
nobody,
not a single soul believes that this 

2141
01:25:56,111 --> 01:25:57,730
person is a woman.
Right.

2142
01:25:57,830 --> 01:25:59,620
Might look like a woman,
might be hot my,

2143
01:25:59,621 --> 01:26:00,401
you know,
all the rest of it.

2144
01:26:00,401 --> 01:26:01,234
But nobody believes it is a woman where 
we have to say we have to use pronouns 

2145
01:26:04,041 --> 01:26:08,210
that suggested we have to warp reality 
language and you know,

2146
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:09,073
uh,
and passports or the infrastructure of 

2147
01:26:10,501 --> 01:26:11,334
the,
of the country has to be remodeled 

2148
01:26:13,100 --> 01:26:13,933
around people with mental disorders.
Imagine if we did this for any other 

2149
01:26:16,490 --> 01:26:17,323
kind of mental disorder.

2150
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:18,313
Why?
Because the left has made this as they 

2151
01:26:20,001 --> 01:26:22,010
put on the front cover of Time magazine 
with Laverne Cox,

2152
01:26:22,250 --> 01:26:24,260
the new civil rights frontier.
While,

2153
01:26:24,261 --> 01:26:25,250
I'm sorry,
wait a minute.

2154
01:26:25,251 --> 01:26:26,084
That was the new civil rights frontier 
was the cover of Time magazine with 

2155
01:26:28,941 --> 01:26:29,774
Laverne Cox,
the hot black one and the new civil 

2156
01:26:31,581 --> 01:26:32,414
rights.
Laverne Cox is the one in orange is the 

2157
01:26:33,501 --> 01:26:35,250
new black black training,
um,

2158
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:36,940
front cover time.
I see it.

2159
01:26:36,941 --> 01:26:38,030
Then you said,
well I'm sorry.

2160
01:26:38,060 --> 01:26:38,811
No,
fuck you.

2161
01:26:38,811 --> 01:26:39,644
Civil Rights is about black people.
Stop trying to take it is not about 

2162
01:26:41,601 --> 01:26:42,434
women.
It's not about gays and it's not about 

2163
01:26:43,221 --> 01:26:45,320
fucking trannies.
Civil rights about black people.

2164
01:26:45,321 --> 01:26:46,460
Stop doing this.
The lab,

2165
01:26:46,461 --> 01:26:48,890
what the left does is it tries to 
present these issues.

2166
01:26:48,891 --> 01:26:51,320
Totally unrelated.
It's a little pet projects.

2167
01:26:51,321 --> 01:26:53,150
It's a little flexing of muscle.
Let's say.

2168
01:26:53,180 --> 01:26:55,250
It's like the left is at home being 
like,

2169
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:58,910
let's see what crazy thing we can make 
people say they believe in today.

2170
01:26:58,910 --> 01:27:00,500
Just because we can,
you know,

2171
01:27:00,740 --> 01:27:01,820
let's,
and this is,

2172
01:27:01,821 --> 01:27:03,770
this is I'm convinced we all get 
together.

2173
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:05,750
You know that there must be some kind of
like left wing build a burger.

2174
01:27:05,751 --> 01:27:06,584
It happens like in Toronto,
it happens like in Toronto or something 

2175
01:27:09,110 --> 01:27:10,910
and they're all together and they're all
like,

2176
01:27:11,330 --> 01:27:14,270
what is the craziest,
most insane,

2177
01:27:14,271 --> 01:27:16,400
most counter intuitive,
most like medically impossible,

2178
01:27:16,401 --> 01:27:17,234
most ridiculous thing we can come up 
with and make everyone believe it and 

2179
01:27:19,131 --> 01:27:20,420
say they believe it.
Because if they don't,

2180
01:27:20,421 --> 01:27:21,890
they'll lose their jobs.
I know.

2181
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:23,300
Trannys perfect.
Right.

2182
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:24,920
That's,
and then of course you've got the,

2183
01:27:25,070 --> 01:27:25,881
you know,
anyway,

2184
01:27:25,881 --> 01:27:27,530
whatever.
This is what they've done.

2185
01:27:27,830 --> 01:27:29,570
Nobody believes this,
but you have to say it.

2186
01:27:29,870 --> 01:27:31,820
It's so wrong.
It's so wrong.

2187
01:27:31,821 --> 01:27:34,160
And when you realize what their real 
motivations aren't,

2188
01:27:34,161 --> 01:27:34,994
you understand why they don't care about
the science and why they're not 

2189
01:27:37,101 --> 01:27:38,750
interested in exploring what we were 
talking about,

2190
01:27:38,751 --> 01:27:39,980
that the treat different treatment 
pathways,

2191
01:27:39,981 --> 01:27:43,130
they don't care about motivations,
whether it's political,

2192
01:27:43,131 --> 01:27:43,970
it's entirely political.

2193
01:27:44,030 --> 01:27:44,751
Um,
you know,

2194
01:27:44,751 --> 01:27:45,584
the left wants to tear down everything.
They want to just deconstruct the 

2195
01:27:48,051 --> 01:27:48,884
differences between men and women 
because they're there because they 

2196
01:27:50,031 --> 01:27:52,670
cannot cope with the fact that women 
aren't as good at some things as men.

2197
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:53,533
Well,
by the way,

2198
01:27:53,690 --> 01:27:55,460
men aren't as good at some things as 
women,

2199
01:27:55,461 --> 01:27:57,980
but you don't talk about that because 
that doesn't suit your narrative because

2200
01:27:57,981 --> 01:27:59,420
you want to paint women as victims all 
the time.

2201
01:27:59,660 --> 01:28:01,260
You know,
you want to pull apart the,

2202
01:28:01,261 --> 01:28:01,920
the,
you know,

2203
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:02,290
they were,
they,

2204
01:28:02,290 --> 01:28:03,123
they want to,
they want to pull apart and destroy 

2205
01:28:03,951 --> 01:28:04,611
everything.
Well,

2206
01:28:04,611 --> 01:28:05,470
isn't it bizarre to

2207
01:28:05,550 --> 01:28:06,383
that in this time and age of gender 
neutral pronouns and these strange new 

2208
01:28:09,341 --> 01:28:13,390
pronouns that they want to stick to the 
traditional male female pronouns when it

2209
01:28:13,391 --> 01:28:14,224
comes to transgender people?
Of course they did without any 

2210
01:28:16,331 --> 01:28:19,270
variation.
Like it's a she of course.

2211
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:19,871
But this,
this,

2212
01:28:19,871 --> 01:28:22,030
this gives you an insight into what's 
really happening.

2213
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:23,500
I mean,
I think it tells its own story,

2214
01:28:23,530 --> 01:28:25,360
right?
They don't really believe it.

2215
01:28:26,140 --> 01:28:26,861
Well,
that's that,

2216
01:28:26,861 --> 01:28:30,400
that is one of the best examples of it 
because they don't really buy it.

2217
01:28:30,401 --> 01:28:31,234
I mean,
this is like what this Justin Trudeau 

2218
01:28:32,141 --> 01:28:32,974
situation where they're trying to have 
gender neutral options and your 

2219
01:28:35,231 --> 01:28:36,064
identification and the thing in New York
that's going on where shopkeepers and 

2220
01:28:40,730 --> 01:28:41,563
employers can be sued by for up to a 
quarter million dollars from this 

2221
01:28:45,330 --> 01:28:49,960
changing use the right bathroom or,
or use yes.

2222
01:28:50,780 --> 01:28:55,690
Including artificial invented pronouns.
Like Zi Aa,

2223
01:28:55,691 --> 01:28:58,760
a quarter of $1 million.
I mean you're here her,

2224
01:28:58,790 --> 01:28:59,500
yeah,
here.

2225
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:00,700
Zaire.
Geez,

2226
01:29:00,701 --> 01:29:01,830
you're I've been gone.

2227
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:03,480
You know I'm good at grandma lucky.
No,

2228
01:29:03,540 --> 01:29:07,140
I'm my mother's German and so I'm good 
with all the different data of genitive,

2229
01:29:07,490 --> 01:29:08,190
blah,
blah blah.

2230
01:29:08,190 --> 01:29:11,460
There are 18 new I call key gender 
pronouns.

2231
01:29:11,550 --> 01:29:12,383
I can't keep track.
I mean one can I'm I'm like Donna total 

2232
01:29:14,761 --> 01:29:15,630
language.
No.

2233
01:29:15,631 --> 01:29:20,550
Do you know like I did linguistics?
I don't like where are they coming from?

2234
01:29:21,050 --> 01:29:23,430
Uh,
I'm trying to remember.

2235
01:29:23,620 --> 01:29:26,680
I used to know about x themself.
Look at this one.

2236
01:29:27,070 --> 01:29:32,070
See Em self don't know xm self.
Is that Zim self?

2237
01:29:33,230 --> 01:29:35,530
I'm trying to write down I them x,
Y,

2238
01:29:37,660 --> 01:29:38,700
Z.
Gee,

2239
01:29:38,770 --> 01:29:39,710
this is just,
this is it.

2240
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:42,640
I'm convinced the left wants to make the
world as ugly as possible.

2241
01:29:42,670 --> 01:29:44,500
They want everyone else to be as ugly as
they are.

2242
01:29:44,620 --> 01:29:46,990
These pronouns are the ugliest words 
I've ever seen.

2243
01:29:47,650 --> 01:29:48,483
There are beautiful,
they're beautiful words and there are 

2244
01:29:49,741 --> 01:29:52,570
ugly words and these are ugly words.
Let's look at what feminists are doing.

2245
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:55,630
They know that I had a podcast about 
this with a great guy,

2246
01:29:55,690 --> 01:29:58,330
Alex Kazemi and he is really,
really clever,

2247
01:29:58,360 --> 01:30:01,030
brilliant writer from Canada.
I love this guy.

2248
01:30:01,031 --> 01:30:02,950
He's friends with a lot of people in 
Hollywood that you would,

2249
01:30:03,050 --> 01:30:05,620
you would know in like very,
very smart,

2250
01:30:05,621 --> 01:30:06,151
interesting.
And,

2251
01:30:06,151 --> 01:30:08,530
and he was talking about my show two 
weeks ago,

2252
01:30:08,710 --> 01:30:09,543
last week,
two weeks ago.

2253
01:30:09,550 --> 01:30:10,930
I don't remember,
uh,

2254
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:12,370
recently and it's good.
Episode 14,

2255
01:30:12,371 --> 01:30:13,150
I think,
uh,

2256
01:30:13,150 --> 01:30:16,900
about how beauty has become marginalized
in mainstream culture.

2257
01:30:16,930 --> 01:30:18,300
You know,
because feminism has told what,

2258
01:30:18,301 --> 01:30:19,690
you know,
the body positivity stuff,

2259
01:30:19,691 --> 01:30:21,670
encouraging women to get fat and get ill
and die,

2260
01:30:22,210 --> 01:30:24,910
which is just the worst kind of 
sociopathy and selfishness and,

2261
01:30:24,911 --> 01:30:27,580
and just just outright lies that we tell
each other.

2262
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:30,550
I'm convinced the left foot because it's
populated,

2263
01:30:30,551 --> 01:30:33,280
and this is all the studies say this by 
just proportionately ugly people.

2264
01:30:33,281 --> 01:30:34,380
Because if you,
if you do the,

2265
01:30:34,570 --> 01:30:35,403
the,
um,

2266
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:38,770
the politicians thing where you take out
Democrat and Republican,

2267
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:39,833
uh,
like politicians and you ask people to 

2268
01:30:40,961 --> 01:30:43,540
rank them in hotness,
it's almost exactly 50,

2269
01:30:43,541 --> 01:30:44,374
50,
you know,

2270
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:45,580
and there are studies on this.
They'd left,

2271
01:30:45,581 --> 01:30:46,414
doesn't even disagree.
It doesn't even didn't bother denying 

2272
01:30:47,501 --> 01:30:49,270
this anymore.
And Republicans are just way hotter.

2273
01:30:49,940 --> 01:30:52,090
Calkins are harder than Democrats.
Every study,

2274
01:30:52,120 --> 01:30:54,520
every survey,
Republicans,

2275
01:30:54,521 --> 01:30:55,354
absolutely all those lovely skinny 
blonde bitches with Fox News ones for 

2276
01:30:58,940 --> 01:31:01,360
sure.
There's got to be a lot of hot,

2277
01:31:01,361 --> 01:31:06,010
so hot.
Really like a row Vicky Yoga teachers?

2278
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:06,340
No,
no,

2279
01:31:06,340 --> 01:31:07,151
no.
The new left,

2280
01:31:07,151 --> 01:31:10,090
the new social justice left the,
the fat,

2281
01:31:10,360 --> 01:31:11,500
ugly,
quivering.

2282
01:31:11,501 --> 01:31:15,010
Lena Dunham left those piercing blue 
hair stuff.

2283
01:31:15,011 --> 01:31:15,844
Well,
these are the people running culture 

2284
01:31:16,331 --> 01:31:19,390
now.
It's not a nice here and they are trying

2285
01:31:19,391 --> 01:31:21,100
to make everybody else's ugly as they 
are.

2286
01:31:21,460 --> 01:31:25,750
But there's a bizarre trend to,
to him embrace having an obese body.

2287
01:31:26,350 --> 01:31:29,030
It's disgusting.
But I wrote about is that like what,

2288
01:31:29,060 --> 01:31:32,650
where is that empowering?
Why is it empowering to be unhealthy,

2289
01:31:32,740 --> 01:31:35,320
listless out of energy.
It isn't,

2290
01:31:35,321 --> 01:31:37,330
but what they're trying to tell the 
immune system,

2291
01:31:37,331 --> 01:31:39,070
how is that empowering?
It's not.

2292
01:31:39,190 --> 01:31:39,930
Um,
and what,

2293
01:31:39,930 --> 01:31:40,541
what,
you know,

2294
01:31:40,541 --> 01:31:41,374
JC penny,
the retailer did this video recently 

2295
01:31:43,901 --> 01:31:45,430
with a load of ham beasts.

2296
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:50,150
You like that?
Like that?

2297
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:51,193
I like actually ham planet.
It sounds so much better coming out of 

2298
01:31:53,331 --> 01:31:55,040
your mouth.
If I call him ham beasts,

2299
01:31:55,190 --> 01:31:56,560
it sounds mean,
but you,

2300
01:31:56,570 --> 01:31:59,090
it's like hum beasts.
Hanbys or ham.

2301
01:31:59,970 --> 01:32:00,230
So

2302
01:32:00,230 --> 01:32:02,000
you like ham planets as another one of 
my favorites.

2303
01:32:02,230 --> 01:32:03,880
Well,
play I guess planets,

2304
01:32:03,970 --> 01:32:06,770
they have their own gravity.
They have a lot of mass ham.

2305
01:32:06,771 --> 01:32:09,580
Feast is Nastier.
Ham planets this or him beast.

2306
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,350
This is a bit lighter touch,
isn't it?

2307
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:12,550
No.
Um,

2308
01:32:12,550 --> 01:32:14,230
these people,
uh,

2309
01:32:14,380 --> 01:32:15,213
fat,
miserable and unhappy with their own 

2310
01:32:16,361 --> 01:32:17,194
lives trying to persuade the rest of us 
that it is not just neutral but a 

2311
01:32:20,681 --> 01:32:21,514
positive and happy and joyous thing.
Almost something to be admired and 

2312
01:32:24,450 --> 01:32:25,283
always something to be imitated.
Being so unhealthy that your chances of 

2313
01:32:28,301 --> 01:32:29,770
diabetes go up,
all the rest of it,

2314
01:32:29,771 --> 01:32:32,680
your chances of disgusting being 
disgusting got 4000%.

2315
01:32:33,070 --> 01:32:33,903
Uh,
you know,

2316
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:36,250
um,
it's very,

2317
01:32:36,251 --> 01:32:40,030
very strange to me.
It's very weird and it's part of this,

2318
01:32:40,060 --> 01:32:43,070
it's part of the left's campaign to to 
make um,

2319
01:32:43,210 --> 01:32:44,590
ugly.
You know,

2320
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:45,433
like there was a,
rush limbaugh used to say this and I 

2321
01:32:47,411 --> 01:32:48,244
think he was right about this,
that feminism is how ugly women get 

2322
01:32:49,841 --> 01:32:50,240
attention.

2323
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:51,073
How it's,
it's a way for ugly women to get 

2324
01:32:53,380 --> 01:32:55,270
purchase in the public sphere,
right?

2325
01:32:55,271 --> 01:32:57,360
This is how ugly women get,
um,

2326
01:32:57,850 --> 01:33:00,730
uh,
positions and he's right about that.

2327
01:33:01,150 --> 01:33:03,070
And this sort of social justice left,
you know,

2328
01:33:03,071 --> 01:33:08,071
the gender queer fat blue head facial 
piercing thing is so horrifying and it's

2329
01:33:08,441 --> 01:33:11,830
just a way for ugly,
marginalized outcasts to make themselves

2330
01:33:11,831 --> 01:33:12,664
feel like they're hot people and they 
want to drag everyone else down because 

2331
01:33:15,370 --> 01:33:17,230
why?
It's a form of self harm.

2332
01:33:17,530 --> 01:33:21,400
It is extended adolescence writ large.
And what my guests said,

2333
01:33:21,401 --> 01:33:23,910
Alex,
cause he was very smart and insightful,

2334
01:33:23,930 --> 01:33:24,311
said,
you know,

2335
01:33:24,311 --> 01:33:25,540
this is it.
How,

2336
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:30,640
how did we normalize Septum piercings?
How did,

2337
01:33:30,641 --> 01:33:31,474
you know,
we lose fantasy and aspiration in 

2338
01:33:33,791 --> 01:33:35,560
culture.
We need those things.

2339
01:33:35,690 --> 01:33:38,620
We need people to look up to and to 
aspire to and to admire.

2340
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:42,340
And it's so horrifying that now the hot 
people are feel marginalized.

2341
01:33:42,340 --> 01:33:43,173
Look at the cover of men's health and 
how much uglier than men on the covers 

2342
01:33:45,461 --> 01:33:46,294
of men's health,
men's health or getting right because 

2343
01:33:47,231 --> 01:33:49,210
they weren't really relatable models.
Yeah.

2344
01:33:49,390 --> 01:33:51,400
The bodies or about the same.
But look at the faces,

2345
01:33:51,610 --> 01:33:52,443
look at how their shot now.
Now they're like friendly and 

2346
01:33:54,011 --> 01:33:55,690
approachable and not too hot.
You know,

2347
01:33:55,710 --> 01:33:56,543
used to be fucking stunning people on 
the cover of men's health like five 

2348
01:33:58,541 --> 01:34:00,400
years ago.
They're getting uglier.

2349
01:34:00,700 --> 01:34:03,940
And you can see it even in magazines,
men's magazines.

2350
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:05,160
That's a trend.
Yep.

2351
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:06,880
Well,
look at the acts commercial,

2352
01:34:06,881 --> 01:34:09,010
the axe commercials,
this cheap deodorant,

2353
01:34:09,011 --> 01:34:10,270
right?
Uh,

2354
01:34:10,290 --> 01:34:11,290
and they,
you know,

2355
01:34:11,291 --> 01:34:13,180
they've got a new ad out you can find on
youtube,

2356
01:34:13,181 --> 01:34:13,811
which is about,
you know,

2357
01:34:13,811 --> 01:34:15,220
nevermind the six pack.
You know,

2358
01:34:15,221 --> 01:34:16,660
you've got the nose or whatever and it 
says,

2359
01:34:16,690 --> 01:34:18,640
ugly guy with a huge nose.
Nevermind.

2360
01:34:18,641 --> 01:34:19,690
You know,
the biceps,

2361
01:34:19,691 --> 01:34:20,680
you've got your bike.

2362
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:23,190
Or some shit like that encouraging men 
to,

2363
01:34:23,191 --> 01:34:26,470
to be ugly and Dorky and unattractive 
and nerdy and horrific.

2364
01:34:26,471 --> 01:34:27,304
Justin the same way that feminist had 
been doing this to women for decades 

2365
01:34:28,871 --> 01:34:29,704
already.
This isn't that just a manipulative ad 

2366
01:34:31,121 --> 01:34:31,954
campaign to try to find marginalized 
people and capitalize on dragging them 

2367
01:34:35,591 --> 01:34:38,470
into your group and selling them some 
shitty fucking deodorant.

2368
01:34:38,710 --> 01:34:42,750
It's trying to legitimize and then 
ultimately to um,

2369
01:34:42,790 --> 01:34:45,780
celebrate irresponsible lifestyle 
choices.

2370
01:34:46,030 --> 01:34:48,250
You talking about this as if some grand 
conspiracy,

2371
01:34:48,251 --> 01:34:49,084
like there's a cabal of fucking lefties 
out there with the evil plan to build a 

2372
01:34:52,230 --> 01:34:53,930
book in Toronto?
No,

2373
01:34:53,980 --> 01:34:55,420
I believe it's,
it happens.

2374
01:34:55,630 --> 01:34:58,780
How else can we explain this?
It definitely happened.

2375
01:34:59,050 --> 01:35:02,930
Just a lot of marginalized people out 
there and they find comfort in groups.

2376
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:03,793
People always find comfort in numbers 
and when they find someone that they 

2377
01:35:05,961 --> 01:35:06,794
think is beautiful and privileged,
they try to lash out at them because 

2378
01:35:09,591 --> 01:35:12,290
they've been jealous of that person for 
a long time.

2379
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:13,153
I just think as a whole person,
I'm feeling very personally victimized 

2380
01:35:15,350 --> 01:35:16,183
by,
you know,

2381
01:35:16,310 --> 01:35:18,290
the messages that society is sending me 
right now.

2382
01:35:18,291 --> 01:35:19,730
And I think I might go home and caught 
myself.

2383
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:20,660
Mm.
Yeah.

2384
01:35:20,661 --> 01:35:21,620
Well don't do that.
No,

2385
01:35:21,621 --> 01:35:23,730
I want to just think about it.
I,

2386
01:35:23,740 --> 01:35:26,390
I see what you're saying and I see these
trends,

2387
01:35:26,391 --> 01:35:27,224
but I think that you're dealing with 
incredibly small numbers of people that 

2388
01:35:30,141 --> 01:35:33,800
are very vocal.
They wheel disproportionate influence.

2389
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:36,530
They have the power and they campus,
no,

2390
01:35:36,531 --> 01:35:36,891
no,
no,

2391
01:35:36,891 --> 01:35:37,550
no,
no,

2392
01:35:37,550 --> 01:35:38,383
no.
Everybody I talked to is like so dumb 

2393
01:35:39,591 --> 01:35:40,424
about this.
Um,

2394
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:42,380
they,
they get things done.

2395
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:44,600
They make companies apologize for 
things.

2396
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:46,580
They change policy,
you know,

2397
01:35:46,581 --> 01:35:48,250
the feminist about video and video games
and say,

2398
01:35:48,251 --> 01:35:49,084
well,
we don't want to take your video games 

2399
01:35:49,431 --> 01:35:50,264
away.
And then suddenly grand theft auto 

2400
01:35:50,961 --> 01:35:52,820
disappears off the shelves of target in 
Australia.

2401
01:35:52,850 --> 01:35:55,940
They get things done.
These people are not harmless.

2402
01:35:55,941 --> 01:35:56,774
These people run culture.
These people have the power to affect 

2403
01:35:59,811 --> 01:36:03,210
what the decision making of massive 
multinet considerations.

2404
01:36:03,620 --> 01:36:04,453
Yes.
Because they're loud because they're 

2405
01:36:05,481 --> 01:36:08,570
organized and they have just enough not,
they're not smart that you know,

2406
01:36:08,571 --> 01:36:09,404
that are kind of like dangerous smart.
They just like a little bit clever and 

2407
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:13,190
with a little bit of like,
you know,

2408
01:36:13,430 --> 01:36:16,070
bare bones,
sophomore at college education in gender

2409
01:36:16,071 --> 01:36:16,904
theory or the rest of it.
They sound smart enough that they can 

2410
01:36:19,671 --> 01:36:20,504
give this veneer of thoughtfulness about
something that is just hateful and 

2411
01:36:23,871 --> 01:36:25,040
insane.
You know,

2412
01:36:25,140 --> 01:36:25,973
and it's so weird to me that we have 
allowed the worst people in society to 

2413
01:36:30,471 --> 01:36:31,304
run the rest of us.
We are allowing the people who hate men 

2414
01:36:33,831 --> 01:36:36,060
to tell girls how they should be women.
We are,

2415
01:36:36,090 --> 01:36:38,780
you know,
that race baiters and black supremacists

2416
01:36:39,060 --> 01:36:41,120
to explain to us how we should treat,
you know,

2417
01:36:41,121 --> 01:36:42,580
how we should negotiate,
you know,

2418
01:36:42,690 --> 01:36:43,820
complex racial issues.

2419
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:48,570
We are allowing hideous fat monsters to 
tell girls no,

2420
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:51,650
these people look like something recife 
thy Murphy.

2421
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:53,690
They look like they're from a Scifi 
movie.

2422
01:36:53,810 --> 01:36:56,750
Put them next to Jabba the hut.
I like close your eyes and open them and

2423
01:36:56,751 --> 01:36:58,100
it takes you a second.
You know,

2424
01:36:58,340 --> 01:37:02,090
like these people would be unknown to 
the America in the 1950s.

2425
01:37:02,270 --> 01:37:04,900
If you look at the pictures of like 
women in the 1950s and you know,

2426
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,940
you know how,
how elegant and it's felt and beautiful.

2427
01:37:07,941 --> 01:37:11,330
They looked and you look now and this 
stuff hurts women than most.

2428
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:15,410
It hurts women horribly because it's 
women who are suffering from the obesity

2429
01:37:15,411 --> 01:37:16,244
crisis.
It's 60% of American women who are now 

2430
01:37:17,781 --> 01:37:18,614
seriously overweight and more women are 
getting obese at greater rates than the 

2431
01:37:21,101 --> 01:37:21,621
men are.
Right?

2432
01:37:21,621 --> 01:37:23,390
The women are getting fatter faster than
the men.

2433
01:37:23,391 --> 01:37:25,460
Or did you read the new study that was 
just released?

2434
01:37:25,810 --> 01:37:26,643
The women of today in 2016 are as heavy 
as men from 1960 [inaudible] the first 

2435
01:37:31,911 --> 01:37:33,290
time ever that's ever happened.
Right?

2436
01:37:33,590 --> 01:37:35,570
But the thing is that w um,
the number,

2437
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:39,890
the number of women and the rate of 
increase is skyrocketing for girls.

2438
01:37:39,980 --> 01:37:40,813
Why?
Because these ham beasts are telling 

2439
01:37:42,951 --> 01:37:43,784
them that being fat is fine and that fat
people can see where Howard people can 

2440
01:37:46,581 --> 01:37:47,710
do anything thin.
People can do it.

2441
01:37:47,720 --> 01:37:49,500
We'll shut the fucking fridge.
Then if you,

2442
01:37:49,501 --> 01:37:51,290
if you could do everything that thin 
people can do,

2443
01:37:51,291 --> 01:37:52,990
close the fridge,
the downward,

2444
01:37:53,110 --> 01:37:54,770
the ice cream scoop.
Look at this.

2445
01:37:54,771 --> 01:37:59,771
The average American woman weighs 166 
pounds.

2446
01:38:00,270 --> 01:38:02,220
That's a lot.
That is a lot.

2447
01:38:02,250 --> 01:38:03,450
That's a lot.
That is,

2448
01:38:03,510 --> 01:38:05,880
that's obese.
That's a law for a woman.

2449
01:38:05,881 --> 01:38:06,840
That's a lot.
You know,

2450
01:38:06,930 --> 01:38:07,763
that's crazy.
That is the same weight as the average 

2451
01:38:11,071 --> 01:38:14,220
American male from the 1960s and look 
men,

2452
01:38:14,221 --> 01:38:15,450
and not completely,
you know,

2453
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:16,710
men and not,
uh,

2454
01:38:16,760 --> 01:38:19,140
um,
immune from this effect.

2455
01:38:19,140 --> 01:38:21,960
We're all getting fatter,
but women are getting a lot faster,

2456
01:38:21,961 --> 01:38:24,630
a lot faster.
But that's a disturbing a number.

2457
01:38:24,660 --> 01:38:25,493
Like for,
for that to be the average weight of a 

2458
01:38:27,181 --> 01:38:28,740
woman,
that's obesity.

2459
01:38:28,890 --> 01:38:30,420
And that's also diet.
I mean,

2460
01:38:30,421 --> 01:38:33,240
that's not like lifting weights on these
women are done.

2461
01:38:33,250 --> 01:38:34,610
Crossfit,
you can go in,

2462
01:38:34,611 --> 01:38:37,710
squats says you don't need to do 
exercise to lose weight.

2463
01:38:37,740 --> 01:38:38,573
It will be better if you did because 
your whole body gets stronger and 

2464
01:38:40,291 --> 01:38:41,790
better.
And you're the expert in this.

2465
01:38:42,030 --> 01:38:43,650
But all you need to do,
if you want to lose 200 pounds,

2466
01:38:43,651 --> 01:38:45,360
just stop fucking eating.
Right.

2467
01:38:45,630 --> 01:38:47,280
I got in trouble on twitter that you 
won't have seen this,

2468
01:38:47,281 --> 01:38:50,310
but I got in huge trouble and treated 
for fat shaming someone at the gym.

2469
01:38:50,730 --> 01:38:51,600
Um,
and I was like,

2470
01:38:51,601 --> 01:38:53,370
no,
this is disgusting.

2471
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:55,230
I don't want to have to look at this.
Right.

2472
01:38:55,290 --> 01:38:57,840
Well this is how first and then they'll 
go to the gym.

2473
01:38:57,870 --> 01:39:00,930
Fat Shaming works right.
And I was doing this person a favor.

2474
01:39:00,931 --> 01:39:03,840
I was doing this person a favor because,
no,

2475
01:39:03,870 --> 01:39:05,370
I wrote an article about this.
I'm serious.

2476
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:07,920
I wrote an article about this.
All the studies say as long as you wrote

2477
01:39:07,921 --> 01:39:09,030
an article,
it must be true.

2478
01:39:09,930 --> 01:39:10,950
You're getting snippy again.

2479
01:39:13,260 --> 01:39:14,340
My,
my,

2480
01:39:14,510 --> 01:39:15,343
my,
my peace drew attention to the real 

2481
01:39:17,371 --> 01:39:18,630
point of my comics,
which studied this.

2482
01:39:18,631 --> 01:39:19,464
The studies show fat shaming works.
But did you point out an individual 

2483
01:39:22,411 --> 01:39:25,920
person and highlight them and did you 
identify them?

2484
01:39:25,950 --> 01:39:27,270
No,
I just did it from behind.

2485
01:39:27,480 --> 01:39:28,890
Oh,
so that it didn't show their face?

2486
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:29,753
No.
Okay.

2487
01:39:29,940 --> 01:39:31,050
It's perfectly fine.
And,

2488
01:39:31,051 --> 01:39:31,770
you know,
look,

2489
01:39:31,770 --> 01:39:35,430
this is how people get thin worrying if 
it could be them next,

2490
01:39:35,550 --> 01:39:36,870
right?
You could somebody tell us,

2491
01:39:36,871 --> 01:39:38,370
are you using argument for that?
You know,

2492
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,620
look,
I encourage you to go read the piece.

2493
01:39:40,660 --> 01:39:41,550
Um,
and it's,

2494
01:39:41,551 --> 01:39:43,320
it's quite enjoy your writing.
So I'll check it out.

2495
01:39:43,350 --> 01:39:44,550
Thank you.
Uh,

2496
01:39:44,610 --> 01:39:45,780
if you're listening to this,
I think it's,

2497
01:39:45,781 --> 01:39:46,614
if you go to,
I think if you've got a bright bottle 

2498
01:39:47,461 --> 01:39:48,660
comm slash minor,
that sort of stuff,

2499
01:39:48,661 --> 01:39:50,070
buying about me so it will be there 
somewhere.

2500
01:39:50,460 --> 01:39:51,540
Uh,
you can,

2501
01:39:51,650 --> 01:39:52,471
um,
you can find it.

2502
01:39:52,471 --> 01:39:54,460
And I wrote two things at JC penny.
Um,

2503
01:39:55,230 --> 01:39:57,180
well I wrote a thing about the JC penny 
thing,

2504
01:39:57,181 --> 01:39:58,650
seeing this fat shaming thing.
It was disgusting.

2505
01:39:58,830 --> 01:40:00,480
Somebody's very hurtful comment 
underneath it.

2506
01:40:00,481 --> 01:40:01,314
They sit down.
This is 1600 words of tenuously 

2507
01:40:03,511 --> 01:40:05,370
connected fat jokes.
If I didn't know better,

2508
01:40:05,371 --> 01:40:06,204
I would have got the impression that you
were claiming the moral high ground 

2509
01:40:08,461 --> 01:40:10,560
merely as an excuse to call people hand 
planets.

2510
01:40:11,610 --> 01:40:15,120
I was very hurt by that criticism.
I think it's accurate and excellent.

2511
01:40:15,690 --> 01:40:17,910
That's a good to be a criticism and is a
second.

2512
01:40:21,300 --> 01:40:23,270
What I,
what I explained in my followup piece,

2513
01:40:23,271 --> 01:40:24,330
he's like,
do some good.

2514
01:40:24,331 --> 01:40:26,610
Call someone fat today.
It works.

2515
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:28,890
Don't believe these bullshit studies 
that come out.

2516
01:40:29,110 --> 01:40:29,943
There's the only serious study that says
that fat shaming doesn't work is from 

2517
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:34,890
University College London and it is 
hopelessly flawed.

2518
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:37,770
It deals with a tiny group of like 50 
year olds and upwards.

2519
01:40:37,771 --> 01:40:38,604
And that's not what this is directed is 
not what the messaging is directed to 

2520
01:40:40,981 --> 01:40:41,814
because they're using young 25 to 35 
year old singers and writers in these 

2521
01:40:45,031 --> 01:40:47,490
commercials telling 20 year old girls 
they can eat what the fuck they want.

2522
01:40:47,670 --> 01:40:49,200
This is not about 50 year olds,
right?

2523
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:51,480
So don't believe this stuff because it's
not true.

2524
01:40:51,481 --> 01:40:52,910
You've got to dig under the surface fat 
shit.

2525
01:40:52,920 --> 01:40:56,230
Of course fat shaming works and anyway,
so I got in trouble for this,

2526
01:40:56,231 --> 01:40:57,064
this tweet,
but I was doing that person trouble 

2527
01:40:58,550 --> 01:40:58,840
though.

2528
01:40:58,840 --> 01:40:59,890
Like what?
What does that mean?

2529
01:41:00,340 --> 01:41:01,173
Negative attention.
But you knew that that was coming 

2530
01:41:02,531 --> 01:41:03,580
anyway.
That's not true.

2531
01:41:03,590 --> 01:41:04,000
Well,
I'm,

2532
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:05,740
no I don't,
cause I tried to do a,

2533
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:07,270
I tried to do it like a,
you know,

2534
01:41:07,271 --> 01:41:09,730
they did those like celebrities read 
mean tweets thing.

2535
01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:13,090
I want to do my own version of that and 
I couldn't find any criticism.

2536
01:41:13,091 --> 01:41:15,160
Everyone loves me so much.
I'd like please,

2537
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:17,580
but no,
seriously I went out,

2538
01:41:17,950 --> 01:41:18,783
I thought my fans were unshockable and I
have found something that they don't 

2539
01:41:21,311 --> 01:41:23,620
like and it's fat shaming.
Well if you're listening to this,

2540
01:41:23,650 --> 01:41:24,483
like you know,
buckle up buttercups cause there's a 

2541
01:41:26,501 --> 01:41:29,460
plenty more coming.
This is no,

2542
01:41:29,740 --> 01:41:30,850
this is not,
I'm not going to be,

2543
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:32,193
I didn't back down for feminism.
I didn't back down for Islam and I 

2544
01:41:34,001 --> 01:41:36,840
didn't back down for black lives matter.
You think your quivering acids are going

2545
01:41:36,841 --> 01:41:37,674
to make me,
are going to make me do a uturn well 

2546
01:41:39,071 --> 01:41:39,904
you're wrong.

2547
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:40,930
No,
this is,

2548
01:41:40,931 --> 01:41:41,764
you know,
this is something I don't want to see 

2549
01:41:42,851 --> 01:41:45,610
when I go out and that person in the gym
to your point about,

2550
01:41:45,611 --> 01:41:46,930
you know,
working out that person,

2551
01:41:46,931 --> 01:41:48,040
the gym,
it doesn't need to be in the gym.

2552
01:41:48,041 --> 01:41:51,340
He was like 350 pounds or something.
The gym is worthless.

2553
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:52,850
Don't bother lifting anything.
True.

2554
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:53,280
Yeah,
no,

2555
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:55,920
it is.
Exercise is a great way to lose weight.

2556
01:41:56,260 --> 01:41:59,320
You it's not.
It's cardio is pointless.

2557
01:41:59,321 --> 01:42:00,154
Cardio is a masochist.
To Way to lose weight is completely 

2558
01:42:01,841 --> 01:42:02,674
pointless.
You can do some wacky like nutrient 

2559
01:42:05,501 --> 01:42:07,660
partitioner that you're entering into my
realm.

2560
01:42:07,661 --> 01:42:09,030
Well,
it is not true at all.

2561
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:12,670
350 pounds.
What is he realistic distinctly going?

2562
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:17,770
It will elevate his metabolism,
will aid in his body burning off at,

2563
01:42:17,771 --> 01:42:20,050
the main thing that needs to do is just 
calories in,

2564
01:42:20,051 --> 01:42:22,300
calories out,
and he'd be 350 pounds.

2565
01:42:22,310 --> 01:42:24,400
The best thing you can do is just stop 
eating.

2566
01:42:24,550 --> 01:42:26,930
This is a person who is clearly taking 
in seven hours,

2567
01:42:26,950 --> 01:42:27,783
10,000
ice either because it's a day stopping 

2568
01:42:30,311 --> 01:42:31,144
eating actually slows your metabolism 
down because your body thinks it's in 

2569
01:42:33,521 --> 01:42:35,200
famine mode,
the right things,

2570
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:40,450
the right to change your gut bacteria.
There's a bunch of different factors,

2571
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:42,340
but one of the,
one of the big ones is sugar,

2572
01:42:42,550 --> 01:42:46,440
sugar and simple.
When I say stop eating fiercely,

2573
01:42:46,450 --> 01:42:48,670
that's a shorthand for don't go to 
Mcdonald's anymore.

2574
01:42:48,970 --> 01:42:50,530
Unhealthy food.
Obviously.

2575
01:42:50,531 --> 01:42:54,850
What has sugar and the carbs,
their body would miraculously shrink.

2576
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:55,713
Well,
I've done it.

2577
01:42:55,750 --> 01:42:57,010
I've done it.
I'm literally,

2578
01:42:57,011 --> 01:42:57,844
I have,
I've told you I've lost like 40 pounds 

2579
01:42:59,681 --> 01:43:01,660
and four inches off my waist and like 
four and a half.

2580
01:43:01,661 --> 01:43:03,850
You can comment on it.
I can be,

2581
01:43:03,851 --> 01:43:05,710
if you're fat,
it's because you're lazy.

2582
01:43:05,740 --> 01:43:06,640
Like stop saying that.

2583
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:08,710
It is some kind of like hormonal 
deficiency or,

2584
01:43:08,711 --> 01:43:09,544
or some emotional disorder.
Don't stop inflicting yourself on the 

2585
01:43:12,251 --> 01:43:14,080
rest of the world.
I don't want to see you at the gym.

2586
01:43:14,081 --> 01:43:15,340
And two,
you are an acceptable size.

2587
01:43:15,341 --> 01:43:16,174
I don't want to see you.
You are horrendous and you are putting 

2588
01:43:18,491 --> 01:43:20,380
me off my workouts.
Stay home,

2589
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:22,510
eat better food.
If you have to run,

2590
01:43:22,690 --> 01:43:24,220
get a running machine delivered to your 
house.

2591
01:43:24,250 --> 01:43:26,020
Amazon has them.
They start at $100.

2592
01:43:26,170 --> 01:43:28,300
I don't want to see you and I don't 
care.

2593
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:30,160
And I,
you know these people,

2594
01:43:30,220 --> 01:43:31,053
I was on Reddit.
I was like a huge thread on reddit lost 

2595
01:43:32,220 --> 01:43:33,660
like the last three days.
You know,

2596
01:43:33,661 --> 01:43:35,400
this monster is like fat shaming,
some poor,

2597
01:43:35,420 --> 01:43:36,050
innocent guy,
the gym,

2598
01:43:36,050 --> 01:43:37,350
he's not innocent.
It his,

2599
01:43:37,390 --> 01:43:38,223
his actions have consequences.
The rest of the world not least 

2600
01:43:39,521 --> 01:43:42,010
aesthetic consequences.
I don't want to have to look at you.

2601
01:43:43,060 --> 01:43:43,970
Well,
um,

2602
01:43:44,020 --> 01:43:49,020
I think that if someone being fat at the
gym throws you off your workout,

2603
01:43:49,090 --> 01:43:51,470
you are not dedicated to your task.
Sir.

2604
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:53,630
Well maybe my not my attention,
my salute.

2605
01:43:53,631 --> 01:43:55,490
People that are fat that are taking a 
chance,

2606
01:43:55,491 --> 01:43:57,530
they're doing something different.
Making it to say,

2607
01:43:58,980 --> 01:44:00,330
hey,
you're turning your life around.

2608
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:02,810
Do it hard.
Do it at home.

2609
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:03,673
Like I saw this guy at the gym doing his
legs were like hanging out of his 

2610
01:44:06,771 --> 01:44:09,170
shorts.
Enormous fat guy,

2611
01:44:09,470 --> 01:44:12,140
but he had the balls to go out in 
public.

2612
01:44:12,141 --> 01:44:13,670
Like that didn't work.
He shouldn't,

2613
01:44:13,671 --> 01:44:15,800
he should stay home in Shaman stove.

2614
01:44:18,620 --> 01:44:20,900
I just agree.
It's terrible for the immune system.

2615
01:44:21,410 --> 01:44:24,430
The Punch cards from whatever disgusting
takeout.

2616
01:44:24,440 --> 01:44:28,340
You're going to delete the numbers from 
your phone for the local pizzeria,

2617
01:44:28,520 --> 01:44:30,980
ordering some Kale,
some protein,

2618
01:44:31,130 --> 01:44:31,963
seven like vegetables and fruit and 
start drinking water and have a good 

2619
01:44:35,121 --> 01:44:35,954
healthy life.
But do it at home until you aren't 

2620
01:44:37,970 --> 01:44:38,803
acceptable size.
And I don't look at you and want to 

2621
01:44:39,711 --> 01:44:41,580
vomit because frank like,
you know,

2622
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:42,553
fine,
I'm easily distracted as you can tell 

2623
01:44:43,671 --> 01:44:45,110
from my scatty conversation.
Right.

2624
01:44:45,410 --> 01:44:46,200
But I v I,
you know,

2625
01:44:46,200 --> 01:44:47,033
I'm very easily distracted.
I'm trying to focus on finishing my 

2626
01:44:48,631 --> 01:44:52,400
[inaudible] and my attention is drawn to
this like gigantic,

2627
01:44:53,270 --> 01:44:56,240
just,
just celestial body entering in,

2628
01:44:56,241 --> 01:44:57,074
you know,
to the sound of thunder and lightning 

2629
01:44:58,480 --> 01:45:00,200
cause it's got its own fucking weather 
system.

2630
01:45:00,430 --> 01:45:02,000
You know,
I just,

2631
01:45:02,030 --> 01:45:02,863
I'm sorry,
I don't know what it is that surprises 

2632
01:45:04,191 --> 01:45:06,740
people so much as a gay man would be 
bitchy about weight,

2633
01:45:06,920 --> 01:45:08,450
but I just,
I'm sick of it.

2634
01:45:08,510 --> 01:45:09,800
I'm sick of it,
you know,

2635
01:45:09,801 --> 01:45:11,240
just stop it.
You're selfish.

2636
01:45:11,241 --> 01:45:14,720
Horrible.
People like the disabled,

2637
01:45:14,721 --> 01:45:16,760
like people in wheelchairs.
Incredibly selfish.

2638
01:45:16,870 --> 01:45:19,330
So no,
no,

2639
01:45:19,331 --> 01:45:20,810
no.
Do you know what we have to do?

2640
01:45:20,811 --> 01:45:23,000
You know what?
We have to do this.

2641
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:25,410
Your trolling,
is God too far?

2642
01:45:26,250 --> 01:45:29,630
Do you know what we should be crippled.
Stay home.

2643
01:45:29,930 --> 01:45:31,820
You know what you look like in our 
children?

2644
01:45:31,821 --> 01:45:33,280
They are monsters.
No,

2645
01:45:33,320 --> 01:45:35,150
they have to their look joy.
We have to do an England now.

2646
01:45:35,151 --> 01:45:36,800
I was a of before I was a generalist,
right?

2647
01:45:36,801 --> 01:45:39,310
I used to build houses.
It's why I can afford,

2648
01:45:39,330 --> 01:45:41,750
can survive on a journalist salary now 
and we,

2649
01:45:41,751 --> 01:45:43,460
you know,
there's it like an ordinance,

2650
01:45:43,461 --> 01:45:44,294
you know in,
in England where you have to put the 

2651
01:45:45,351 --> 01:45:47,720
light switch is not here where everyone 
needs them.

2652
01:45:47,810 --> 01:45:49,910
But here where the wheelchair people 
need them.

2653
01:45:50,150 --> 01:45:50,983
Why I'm not selling my house to,
so I'm not how to say my house to 

2654
01:45:53,241 --> 01:45:54,230
somebody with no legs.

2655
01:45:54,410 --> 01:45:55,920
Like what the hell is going on this,
these,

2656
01:45:55,980 --> 01:45:59,870
this is the supposedly these tiny little
minorities and people who say they speak

2657
01:45:59,871 --> 01:46:02,080
for those minorities who don't because 
most of the people that I know,

2658
01:46:02,260 --> 01:46:03,093
you know,
I know veterans who are in wheelchairs 

2659
01:46:04,461 --> 01:46:05,294
who would probably laugh at the 
conversation we just had rather than 

2660
01:46:06,501 --> 01:46:08,570
getting offended and then we'd say,
yeah,

2661
01:46:08,571 --> 01:46:10,040
put the light switch is wherever the 
fuck you want.

2662
01:46:10,220 --> 01:46:11,053
But no,
these sort of stupid lobbies where all 

2663
01:46:11,871 --> 01:46:15,140
of us has to calf to count out these 
tiny slices of society.

2664
01:46:15,141 --> 01:46:17,410
It's ridiculous.
Know you have to put these lights,

2665
01:46:17,411 --> 01:46:20,060
which is done with it inconvenient for 
99.8%

2666
01:46:20,061 --> 01:46:21,620
of the rest of the population.
And then you,

2667
01:46:21,640 --> 01:46:22,101
uh,
these,

2668
01:46:22,101 --> 01:46:25,010
these disabled people were demanding 
like concrete ramps on the way up to the

2669
01:46:25,011 --> 01:46:25,844
council building so he can go and 
collect their disability benefit and 

2670
01:46:27,741 --> 01:46:31,130
their welfare checks twice a year.
Just get someone to help you.

2671
01:46:31,320 --> 01:46:33,960
There was somebody in the UK who filed a
lawsuit against a council.

2672
01:46:33,961 --> 01:46:36,950
We didn't have accessible ramps.
My God,

2673
01:46:36,951 --> 01:46:37,784
these people are out of control.
I don't think there's anything wrong 

2674
01:46:40,731 --> 01:46:42,320
with a wheelchair ramp.
No,

2675
01:46:42,630 --> 01:46:43,880
probably not.
I might have got a little bit,

2676
01:46:43,910 --> 01:46:45,370
you get a little look,
I've got a little carried away.

2677
01:46:45,371 --> 01:46:47,470
She stuck with the fat thing cause I 
don't know,

2678
01:46:47,480 --> 01:46:50,070
I mean the fat thing I was,
I was sympathetic on and there is a

2679
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:50,903
thing there where you're making sense 
were making people feel bad instead of 

2680
01:46:54,511 --> 01:46:56,730
saying you're beautiful.
No matter what you are,

2681
01:46:56,850 --> 01:46:59,040
you're not place.
It's unhealthy.

2682
01:46:59,100 --> 01:47:02,700
And it's not smart.
This beautiful at any size,

2683
01:47:03,090 --> 01:47:04,260
it's not true.
You know,

2684
01:47:04,261 --> 01:47:06,780
at the Nep is young and unusual.
It's unique.

2685
01:47:07,260 --> 01:47:09,530
That's why it's so special.
Well there was,

2686
01:47:09,531 --> 01:47:11,310
you know,
there are objective beauty standards for

2687
01:47:11,311 --> 01:47:12,240
men and women.
Sure.

2688
01:47:12,360 --> 01:47:14,640
Uh,
and most,

2689
01:47:14,730 --> 01:47:15,563
you know,
there are people who most people find 

2690
01:47:16,471 --> 01:47:18,540
hot and those people tend not to be the 
size,

2691
01:47:18,730 --> 01:47:20,320
the size of houses,
you know,

2692
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:22,050
or,
or how about are never,

2693
01:47:22,590 --> 01:47:24,660
and usually when people say that they 
are hot,

2694
01:47:24,661 --> 01:47:25,494
they're being disingenuous,
they're applying these artificial 

2695
01:47:27,811 --> 01:47:30,460
standards,
making a fake standard bullshit.

2696
01:47:30,870 --> 01:47:33,990
What do you think by the way of the,
cause I was talking to,

2697
01:47:34,070 --> 01:47:35,820
he was actually,
I think it was in culture as well.

2698
01:47:36,030 --> 01:47:37,230
I was talking to somebody today about,
you know,

2699
01:47:37,231 --> 01:47:39,450
all this kind of like sexual harassment 
stuff,

2700
01:47:39,630 --> 01:47:40,463
um,
sexual harassment stuff that women do 

2701
01:47:43,261 --> 01:47:45,180
now when they've been touched on the leg
or whatever.

2702
01:47:45,540 --> 01:47:47,710
And Anna has this theory.
I actually,

2703
01:47:47,711 --> 01:47:49,890
I don't know whether it was,
I shouldn't drop her in it cause I can't

2704
01:47:49,891 --> 01:47:51,150
remember.
It was a part of the conversation on the

2705
01:47:51,151 --> 01:47:52,470
podcast.
So let me just say,

2706
01:47:52,471 --> 01:47:55,110
this is my theory.
So this is not ankle to theory.

2707
01:47:55,111 --> 01:47:55,944
She is not guilty because I can't 
honestly remember whether she said it's 

2708
01:47:57,701 --> 01:47:59,160
on all the way she said it.
But there's,

2709
01:47:59,430 --> 01:48:02,130
what do you think about this,
this sexual harassment craze right now?

2710
01:48:02,460 --> 01:48:04,560
It's really just a way for women to tell
you they've been hit on,

2711
01:48:04,561 --> 01:48:05,394
isn't it?
It's really just a way for women to 

2712
01:48:06,481 --> 01:48:08,790
saving up the somebody well known,
but not just that,

2713
01:48:08,791 --> 01:48:11,310
but somebody was expressing sexual 
interest in me because all of these like

2714
01:48:11,580 --> 01:48:14,880
quote unquote rape stories from campuses
that don't actually involve any sex.

2715
01:48:15,150 --> 01:48:15,983
Um,
of course the ones that do involve sex 

2716
01:48:17,491 --> 01:48:19,530
rape stories are all for all frauds and 
hoaxes.

2717
01:48:19,780 --> 01:48:21,750
Um,
the ones that don't,

2718
01:48:21,780 --> 01:48:22,930
the ones that involve sex,
they sort of,

2719
01:48:22,931 --> 01:48:24,450
they're all hideous.
Someone touched my breast.

2720
01:48:24,451 --> 01:48:26,640
How awful.
What's a woman really telling you there?

2721
01:48:26,850 --> 01:48:28,610
She's telling you that,
uh,

2722
01:48:28,860 --> 01:48:31,140
someone was sexually interested in her.
It's the sort of bragging,

2723
01:48:31,141 --> 01:48:31,980
isn't it?
Well,

2724
01:48:31,981 --> 01:48:35,610
it only does.
One does really touch your breasts.

2725
01:48:36,790 --> 01:48:38,540
Are we supposed to know now?
And it's always people,

2726
01:48:38,541 --> 01:48:40,350
some guy just comes up and grabs your 
tit.

2727
01:48:40,380 --> 01:48:42,780
Oh God,
that is sexual assault.

2728
01:48:43,050 --> 01:48:43,883
It's not.
Our parents' generation would have 

2729
01:48:45,451 --> 01:48:46,340
turned around and said,
Kia,

2730
01:48:46,500 --> 01:48:49,260
keep your fucking hands to yourself and 
moved on with their lives.

2731
01:48:49,350 --> 01:48:50,183
They wouldn't have gone into university 
administrators and tried to destroy the 

2732
01:48:52,441 --> 01:48:55,450
guy's reputation in life over.
It's not that big a deal because I might

2733
01:48:55,451 --> 01:48:57,000
touch your to get over it.

2734
01:48:57,240 --> 01:49:00,150
That's a big deal.
That's a no person that doesn't have any

2735
01:49:00,151 --> 01:49:02,340
respect to somebody else's body.
It's rude,

2736
01:49:02,341 --> 01:49:04,800
but when you enlarge the take those 
people out of campus,

2737
01:49:04,801 --> 01:49:05,634
you shouldn't be allowed to do this.
That someone's pussy that you'd be able 

2738
01:49:08,851 --> 01:49:11,970
to grab girl's ass and squeezy.
Obviously there's a line,

2739
01:49:11,971 --> 01:49:12,804
but listen,
but you can fuck with someone 

2740
01:49:13,471 --> 01:49:14,580
emotionally.
We don't do that.

2741
01:49:14,590 --> 01:49:18,720
You're making physical contact.
You on inappropriate where an adult,

2742
01:49:19,110 --> 01:49:19,943
you know what appropriate behavior is.
18 and 19 year old kids who are coming 

2743
01:49:23,821 --> 01:49:25,360
to college and this is where you,
you,

2744
01:49:25,380 --> 01:49:28,990
you know messily exploring their 
sexuality.

2745
01:49:28,991 --> 01:49:30,540
Yes.
Exploring other people.

2746
01:49:30,630 --> 01:49:31,463
There are all sorts of confused,
awkward situations in those years at 

2747
01:49:35,311 --> 01:49:37,620
college.
What we should not do is be going in and

2748
01:49:37,621 --> 01:49:40,050
legislating which colleges are now 
trying to do legislative,

2749
01:49:40,051 --> 01:49:40,884
the sex lives of people who are 
discovering each other and don't know 

2750
01:49:42,481 --> 01:49:44,310
what the rules are yet.
Right.

2751
01:49:44,340 --> 01:49:45,173
Everybody knows you don't walk up to a 
girl and grab her and they know they 

2752
01:49:47,880 --> 01:49:48,190
should

2753
01:49:48,190 --> 01:49:51,090
learn and the best way to learn is what 
is a woman's at school.

2754
01:49:51,300 --> 01:49:52,031
No,
no,

2755
01:49:52,031 --> 01:49:53,410
no.
The Way to learn is a woman,

2756
01:49:53,411 --> 01:49:53,951
Tony Man,
and saying,

2757
01:49:53,951 --> 01:49:55,690
keep your fucking hands to yourself and 
your friends saying,

2758
01:49:55,691 --> 01:49:56,650
dude,
what are you doing?

2759
01:49:56,890 --> 01:49:58,990
That's how you or your friend goes,
dude,

2760
01:49:58,991 --> 01:50:01,420
that was awesome.
I got it on camera.

2761
01:50:01,470 --> 01:50:02,303
Well,
they're always going to be people like 

2762
01:50:02,531 --> 01:50:03,030
that.
You can't,

2763
01:50:03,030 --> 01:50:03,863
you know,
you want to on a mass recommendations 

2764
01:50:04,980 --> 01:50:07,180
because he touched him.
So his reputation is shitty.

2765
01:50:07,181 --> 01:50:08,710
Well,
Sean grabbing strangers,

2766
01:50:08,711 --> 01:50:09,220
tit,
no,

2767
01:50:09,220 --> 01:50:11,320
you'll see all this is,
this is a mistake.

2768
01:50:11,560 --> 01:50:14,680
Your natural instinct toward chivalry 
and gallantry,

2769
01:50:14,710 --> 01:50:19,360
which is to your great credit,
is I think blinding you with the reality

2770
01:50:19,361 --> 01:50:20,194
of what's happening on college campuses,
which is young boys are effectively 

2771
01:50:22,961 --> 01:50:26,020
being criminalized for normal 
exploration of their sexuality.

2772
01:50:26,460 --> 01:50:27,293
There's a very specific example you're 
talking about unwanted grabbing a 

2773
01:50:30,131 --> 01:50:30,580
breast.

2774
01:50:30,580 --> 01:50:31,413
I do think that there's a lot of people 
trying to hit on people in a clumsy way 

2775
01:50:35,231 --> 01:50:36,064
that gets misinterpreted or that's an 
issue we talking about physically 

2776
01:50:40,661 --> 01:50:43,120
grabbing someone's tip,
which is really crossing the line.

2777
01:50:43,121 --> 01:50:45,400
People grabbed each other for kisses all
the time.

2778
01:50:45,401 --> 01:50:47,470
Like in its student nightclubs.
People were just like,

2779
01:50:47,500 --> 01:50:48,333
you know,
like go in for a kiss and maybe like 

2780
01:50:49,691 --> 01:50:51,430
their lips touch or something.
Is that sexual assault?

2781
01:50:51,470 --> 01:50:55,270
Just gimme a break.
That's is people now that's different.

2782
01:50:55,660 --> 01:50:56,493
Yeah.
We're talking about unwanted tit 

2783
01:50:57,041 --> 01:50:57,874
grazers.
So that's worse than like putting your 

2784
01:50:59,441 --> 01:51:00,820
tongue down someone's throat when they 
don't want it.

2785
01:51:01,090 --> 01:51:02,500
Well,
if they don't want it,

2786
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:05,230
you should probably know when someone 
wants to be kissed.

2787
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:07,120
Yeah.
But you know if that's exactly my point,

2788
01:51:07,150 --> 01:51:09,040
they don't,
you're at college,

2789
01:51:09,100 --> 01:51:10,960
you may have been to an all boys high 
school.

2790
01:51:10,961 --> 01:51:11,230
Right.

2791
01:51:11,230 --> 01:51:14,630
You made learning come to terms with the
other,

2792
01:51:14,670 --> 01:51:16,000
you know,
with the opposite sex,

2793
01:51:16,180 --> 01:51:18,340
you are discovering your own body,
their body.

2794
01:51:18,341 --> 01:51:20,270
You might not even know if you're gay.
Right.

2795
01:51:20,460 --> 01:51:23,380
Or you don't know what the rules are.
You don't know what the rules are.

2796
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:24,333
I know what the rules are.
18 year old kids do not know what the 

2797
01:51:26,291 --> 01:51:27,124
rules are and to have their entire half 
their reputations destroyed forever is 

2798
01:51:29,801 --> 01:51:32,260
obscene.
And I think there's a difference between

2799
01:51:32,261 --> 01:51:33,820
when did the scenario you're describing 
now,

2800
01:51:33,821 --> 01:51:36,970
which is like a nightclub scene.
Two people are close to each other,

2801
01:51:36,971 --> 01:51:41,020
guy moves in for a kiss,
takes a breast and goes in for a kiss.

2802
01:51:41,021 --> 01:51:42,950
I mean these things just happen.
My God,

2803
01:51:42,951 --> 01:51:43,810
have you,
if these,

2804
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:46,300
if these campus administrators walked 
into a gay club,

2805
01:51:46,301 --> 01:51:47,134
they would,
their heads would explode with the 

2806
01:51:48,491 --> 01:51:51,130
amount of like inappropriate cock 
touching and all the rest of it.

2807
01:51:51,130 --> 01:51:54,280
But that's excludes dudes with dude's.
There's no Yang.

2808
01:51:54,281 --> 01:51:56,320
It's all younger lesbians don't have sex
at all,

2809
01:51:56,321 --> 01:51:57,160
do they?
Well,

2810
01:51:57,161 --> 01:51:59,530
if they do,
it's not the same.

2811
01:51:59,720 --> 01:52:00,553
If that's another weird thing I wanted 
to bring up about transgender people is 

2812
01:52:02,591 --> 01:52:05,080
that a lot of them become lesbians.
They turn into women,

2813
01:52:05,081 --> 01:52:06,790
but then they,
they wanna have sex with men.

2814
01:52:06,820 --> 01:52:09,190
This is sort of another way that they 
regret comes out,

2815
01:52:09,191 --> 01:52:09,881
isn't it?
Well,

2816
01:52:09,881 --> 01:52:12,730
that's a Bruce Jenner thing and I know 
several other ones as well.

2817
01:52:12,731 --> 01:52:15,040
Or this general lesbian,
did we have to call it?

2818
01:52:15,400 --> 01:52:17,020
Do you have to call him a lesbian now?
Well,

2819
01:52:17,021 --> 01:52:18,790
he just,
Bruce Bruce Jenner,

2820
01:52:18,791 --> 01:52:23,791
winner of the 200 meters is not as well.
What's weird is when you go back to that

2821
01:52:24,671 --> 01:52:26,800
era of the Olympics,
like what does it say?

2822
01:52:26,801 --> 01:52:28,570
Does it say Bruce Jenner one or does it 
say,

2823
01:52:28,571 --> 01:52:29,800
Katelyn,
do they changed it?

2824
01:52:29,801 --> 01:52:30,810
I've looked,
no,

2825
01:52:30,840 --> 01:52:31,091
no,
no.

2826
01:52:31,091 --> 01:52:33,640
They've changed it.
They've changed it in wikipedia.

2827
01:52:34,110 --> 01:52:34,943
In wikipedia it says,
it says worse even than you think it's 

2828
01:52:37,061 --> 01:52:39,460
as Katelyn Jana was the winner of the 
men's too.

2829
01:52:40,930 --> 01:52:43,900
That's what it says now.
That's what that is.

2830
01:52:44,780 --> 01:52:45,710
Madness.

2831
01:52:47,690 --> 01:52:49,250
I'm serious.
Just says,

2832
01:52:49,251 --> 01:52:50,420
God,
that's so crazy.

2833
01:52:50,450 --> 01:52:52,220
I know.
I know what that is.

2834
01:52:52,221 --> 01:52:53,054
Uh,
that is a sign of the times what 

2835
01:52:54,771 --> 01:52:58,100
happened to us?
Why did we get so bizarre and how did it

2836
01:52:58,101 --> 01:53:00,310
happen so quickly and services,
uh,

2837
01:53:00,530 --> 01:53:05,380
gave up the culture wars.
That's a simplistic gas.

2838
01:53:05,400 --> 01:53:05,870
No,
it's,

2839
01:53:05,870 --> 01:53:08,000
well,
sometimes the sequester accelerating.

2840
01:53:08,120 --> 01:53:08,953
There's an accelerating attitude that 
that somehow or another is prevalent 

2841
01:53:12,290 --> 01:53:14,390
throughout college campuses throughout.
It's the,

2842
01:53:14,460 --> 01:53:15,293
the,
it's not the same left of the 1960s and 

2843
01:53:17,181 --> 01:53:22,181
the 70s it's this new left whereas the 
left is mutated slightly.

2844
01:53:23,661 --> 01:53:26,240
It's got more hardline and crazier,
but it is the same people.

2845
01:53:26,241 --> 01:53:27,170
I mean the campus,
you know,

2846
01:53:27,171 --> 01:53:28,004
the,
the same professors who around in the 

2847
01:53:30,110 --> 01:53:30,943
70s and eighties and now still work in 
the gender studies department and the 

2848
01:53:32,301 --> 01:53:37,280
same people that have got their views.
But my point is the right doesn't really

2849
01:53:37,281 --> 01:53:40,790
embrace much different values and rules 
than they did in the 70s,

2850
01:53:40,791 --> 01:53:41,360
80s and nine.

2851
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:42,021
No,
that's not true.

2852
01:53:42,021 --> 01:53:42,854
You just have no idea what they do 
because they've completely exited the 

2853
01:53:44,991 --> 01:53:45,824
conversation.
The right has not bothered to engage on 

2854
01:53:47,610 --> 01:53:48,980
kit,
on university campuses.

2855
01:53:49,160 --> 01:53:49,993
Uh,
it has not put up a fight in education 

2856
01:53:51,411 --> 01:53:53,330
or entertainment.
It is not part of fight in the,

2857
01:53:53,360 --> 01:53:55,310
in the media.
It's not put up a fight anyway.

2858
01:53:55,311 --> 01:53:56,144
It's given.
It is,

2859
01:53:56,210 --> 01:53:57,890
it doesn't fought and lost the culture 
wars.

2860
01:53:57,920 --> 01:53:58,753
It merely handed them over to the left 
because the right the right is full of 

2861
01:54:01,611 --> 01:54:02,444
dorks.
And geeks and loses and Weirdos who are 

2862
01:54:04,011 --> 01:54:04,844
obsessed with money and power.
It's all they care about is Wall Street 

2863
01:54:06,171 --> 01:54:07,004
and Washington.
What they forgot is that people don't 

2864
01:54:09,111 --> 01:54:09,944
vote for Wall Street and Washington.
People vote according to their values 

2865
01:54:12,411 --> 01:54:14,000
and they learn their values through 
culture,

2866
01:54:14,001 --> 01:54:15,950
through art,
through what they watch on TV,

2867
01:54:15,951 --> 01:54:16,784
the music they listen to and the the 
right just handed that over to the left 

2868
01:54:19,700 --> 01:54:22,310
and the left has run those things for 30
years.

2869
01:54:22,520 --> 01:54:23,353
And that's why things are so crazy 
because the people running it had been 

2870
01:54:25,971 --> 01:54:28,520
unopposed for 30 years.
So they've user called evermore wildly,

2871
01:54:28,521 --> 01:54:31,550
wildly hysterical and crazy because we 
all need healthy opposition,

2872
01:54:31,570 --> 01:54:32,403
you know,
but you don't think there's been a 

2873
01:54:33,620 --> 01:54:34,453
comparable sort of shift in the right 
where the left has gotten wilder and 

2874
01:54:39,051 --> 01:54:42,350
crazier with their idea is the right is 
not the right or it hasn't gone crazy.

2875
01:54:42,351 --> 01:54:43,800
If anything,
the right it's going to be terrian.

2876
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:47,140
If you look at the most exciting bits of
the right,

2877
01:54:47,240 --> 01:54:48,920
perhaps breitbart where I work,
um,

2878
01:54:48,921 --> 01:54:50,870
I think a large proportion of trump's 
voters,

2879
01:54:51,050 --> 01:54:51,883
and I think a lot of just conservatives 
in general reacting against political 

2880
01:54:54,231 --> 01:54:55,064
correctness and responding to the worst 
excesses of nannying pole clutching 

2881
01:54:59,151 --> 01:54:59,984
culture.
I think the writers become a 

2882
01:55:01,061 --> 01:55:03,500
libertarian.
I think Pearl clutching,

2883
01:55:03,810 --> 01:55:05,890
you know,
sort of like fainting couch comes up,

2884
01:55:05,960 --> 01:55:06,260
right?

2885
01:55:06,260 --> 01:55:09,530
I think for many on the right,
um,

2886
01:55:09,620 --> 01:55:10,453
the reaction gets political correctness 
has pushed them in a libertarian 

2887
01:55:11,871 --> 01:55:12,704
direction.
And if you want to be a libertarian 

2888
01:55:13,371 --> 01:55:14,204
today,
you pretty much have to be a 

2889
01:55:14,511 --> 01:55:16,850
conservative.
And I think also,

2890
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:17,713
um,
the other thing has happened on the 

2891
01:55:19,881 --> 01:55:24,881
right is the death of really of,
of the reduced influence of religion and

2892
01:55:25,791 --> 01:55:29,240
politics,
which you will probably find welcome has

2893
01:55:29,241 --> 01:55:31,220
meant,
I think for people under 40,

2894
01:55:31,310 --> 01:55:33,920
the social conservatism of their 
parents' and grandparents' generation is

2895
01:55:33,921 --> 01:55:34,754
effectively dead and gone.
And the most exciting young 

2896
01:55:36,741 --> 01:55:38,990
conservatives don't look like all 
conservatives.

2897
01:55:38,991 --> 01:55:41,420
They're not like rich old white man who 
you know,

2898
01:55:41,421 --> 01:55:43,050
hate gay marriage and our,
you know,

2899
01:55:43,080 --> 01:55:45,510
sound faintly racist after a couple of 
glasses of wine.

2900
01:55:45,810 --> 01:55:47,010
They are young,
interesting,

2901
01:55:47,011 --> 01:55:47,791
quirky,
funny,

2902
01:55:47,791 --> 01:55:49,080
dissident punks.
You know,

2903
01:55:49,081 --> 01:55:49,914
who only find room to grow and be 
dangerous and difficult and expand on 

2904
01:55:52,951 --> 01:55:53,700
the right.

2905
01:55:53,700 --> 01:55:54,533
I think I fall into that bracket,
but also a lot of trump's young fans 

2906
01:55:56,371 --> 01:55:57,204
fall into that bracket.
People who just want the freedom to say 

2907
01:55:58,801 --> 01:56:01,470
do and be anything.
There's nowhere for the left arm.

2908
01:56:01,570 --> 01:56:03,300
There's nowhere left on the left for 
them.

2909
01:56:03,360 --> 01:56:05,130
That is a bizarre shift.
Yeah.

2910
01:56:05,131 --> 01:56:06,840
That is a very bizarre shift we're 
getting.

2911
01:56:06,841 --> 01:56:07,674
Being accepting of that kind of behavior
is much more thought of as something 

2912
01:56:10,870 --> 01:56:12,450
over,
it's now a conservative thing.

2913
01:56:12,480 --> 01:56:13,313
That's bizarre.
It's now a conservative thing and I 

2914
01:56:14,551 --> 01:56:15,384
don't think any,
I don't think anybody can realistically 

2915
01:56:16,891 --> 01:56:19,200
claim otherwise.
If you are a dissident,

2916
01:56:19,201 --> 01:56:20,034
a mischief maker,
if you believe in pushing boundaries in 

2917
01:56:21,661 --> 01:56:22,530
sex,
culture,

2918
01:56:22,531 --> 01:56:23,281
art,
philosophy,

2919
01:56:23,281 --> 01:56:24,120
literature,
whatever,

2920
01:56:24,121 --> 01:56:25,020
whatever it is,
right?

2921
01:56:25,290 --> 01:56:28,770
If you want to be dangerous,
you have to be a conservative.

2922
01:56:28,980 --> 01:56:30,070
And the left did this,
the right,

2923
01:56:30,071 --> 01:56:31,710
it didn't do it.
The right didn't win any arguments.

2924
01:56:31,740 --> 01:56:32,573
They just,
the left just got overconfident and got 

2925
01:56:33,451 --> 01:56:35,550
carried away and alienated the rest of 
us.

2926
01:56:35,820 --> 01:56:37,080
You know,
I could've,

2927
01:56:37,110 --> 01:56:39,490
I could've been like a center lefty if,
if,

2928
01:56:39,491 --> 01:56:41,790
if they were more sensible on,
I don't know,

2929
01:56:42,330 --> 01:56:44,700
economics or whatever.
But on social issues,

2930
01:56:44,701 --> 01:56:45,840
I'm a perfect example.
You know,

2931
01:56:45,841 --> 01:56:46,674
I'm,
I'm foul mouth and young and gay and 

2932
01:56:50,490 --> 01:56:52,170
love black whatever and all the rest of 
it.

2933
01:56:52,500 --> 01:56:56,370
I shouldn't,
I shouldn't be a conservative on paper.

2934
01:56:56,400 --> 01:56:57,450
Right.
But I am,

2935
01:56:57,451 --> 01:57:00,360
because the left is ejected me because 
I've got the wrong opinions about things

2936
01:57:00,361 --> 01:57:01,194
and because it won't let me talk how I 
want to talk because you have honest 

2937
01:57:02,911 --> 01:57:06,030
opinions about feminism,
honest opinions about social justice.

2938
01:57:06,060 --> 01:57:07,020
And so,
so I'm,

2939
01:57:07,021 --> 01:57:08,160
I'm persona non,
gosh to the left,

2940
01:57:08,190 --> 01:57:10,120
I only got one place left to go.
And,

2941
01:57:10,350 --> 01:57:12,030
and this is how the left has created,
you know,

2942
01:57:12,031 --> 01:57:14,190
hundreds of thousands if not millions of
trump voters.

2943
01:57:14,190 --> 01:57:14,551
You know,
the,

2944
01:57:14,551 --> 01:57:15,840
the,
the nannying and the,

2945
01:57:15,841 --> 01:57:16,674
and the,
the controlling that school mom 

2946
01:57:18,610 --> 01:57:19,443
missioners you know,
where they want to order your crayons 

2947
01:57:21,150 --> 01:57:24,390
and treat us all like children has 
pushed so many of us over to the right.

2948
01:57:24,391 --> 01:57:25,224
And I'm like,
I'm,

2949
01:57:25,230 --> 01:57:27,540
I'm far right now,
I'm as right as it gets.

2950
01:57:27,541 --> 01:57:28,590
You know,
I'm so,

2951
01:57:28,591 --> 01:57:31,680
so I'm so far right on economics or the 
rest of it's social.

2952
01:57:31,681 --> 01:57:33,420
Obviously a bit more,
get more complex,

2953
01:57:33,421 --> 01:57:34,980
but you know,
on the borders,

2954
01:57:35,010 --> 01:57:36,630
on trade,
you know,

2955
01:57:36,631 --> 01:57:37,464
I'm a,
I'm a trump guy now I might have ended 

2956
01:57:38,941 --> 01:57:41,250
up very differently if I hadn't been 
ejected by the left.

2957
01:57:41,670 --> 01:57:45,150
But do you have any problems with trump 
with his behavior,

2958
01:57:45,151 --> 01:57:48,180
with any of his past statements?
Nothing.

2959
01:57:48,240 --> 01:57:50,760
Nothing.
He's a perfect angel from heaven,

2960
01:57:51,380 --> 01:57:52,213
but that's,
you're,

2961
01:57:52,240 --> 01:57:53,880
you're being silly.
Oh No,

2962
01:57:53,881 --> 01:57:55,310
I think he's great.
Well,

2963
01:57:55,470 --> 01:57:56,290
what's he done well?

2964
01:57:56,290 --> 01:57:56,760
Like,
okay.

2965
01:57:56,760 --> 01:57:58,630
Tell me what the worst things you think 
he's done it.

2966
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:01,140
Well,
business wise there's been,

2967
01:58:01,200 --> 01:58:03,530
uh,
well this is one of the things that Joey

2968
01:58:03,530 --> 01:58:04,363
Diaz has talked about in the podcast 
that he knew back from a long time ago 

2969
01:58:07,650 --> 01:58:08,483
in the construction business.
Trump was famous for having these 

2970
01:58:11,461 --> 01:58:15,490
projects and not paying people and 
there,

2971
01:58:15,500 --> 01:58:19,320
it doesn't sound very likely if trump 
doesn't sound likely,

2972
01:58:19,350 --> 01:58:20,910
where are these people?
Who are they?

2973
01:58:21,290 --> 01:58:22,550
They wouldn't have come out in the press
by now.

2974
01:58:22,580 --> 01:58:24,480
I've come out in the press,
there's quite a few of them.

2975
01:58:24,481 --> 01:58:25,710
You know,
he'll,

2976
01:58:26,010 --> 01:58:27,840
he'll pull some of them up so you can 
see some of the stories.

2977
01:58:27,841 --> 01:58:31,110
But was it a what one New York paper?
I've,

2978
01:58:31,170 --> 01:58:32,460
I've,
I've heard a couple of times too.

2979
01:58:32,461 --> 01:58:35,370
There's a bunch of like smaller time 
contractors that would take him,

2980
01:58:35,490 --> 01:58:37,190
oh please.
Some dis,

2981
01:58:37,200 --> 01:58:38,033
some,
some disgruntled little mom and pop 

2982
01:58:39,781 --> 01:58:41,500
shop.
Then a mom and pop

2983
01:58:42,620 --> 01:58:43,453
through.
I didn't get construction company and 

2984
01:58:44,561 --> 01:58:45,394
they would get a bid to work on one of 
his buildings and they would spend all 

2985
01:58:47,711 --> 01:58:50,890
this money on it and it would start 
working and then he wouldn't pay them.

2986
01:58:51,100 --> 01:58:51,933
And in doing that,
crushed a lot of her business has a 

2987
01:58:54,581 --> 01:58:55,414
history of not paying his bills that 
offers some insights into his 

2988
01:58:57,761 --> 01:58:58,594
personality.
USA Today is posted an explosive 

2989
01:59:01,271 --> 01:59:02,104
investigative story about what appears 
to be a deep aversion presumptive gop 

2990
01:59:06,390 --> 01:59:09,880
nomination nominee Donald Trump has to 
paying his bills.

2991
01:59:09,881 --> 01:59:10,714
The short version,
USA Today claims is based on what looks 

2992
01:59:13,301 --> 01:59:14,134
like some rather impressive reporting.
Trump has for decades looked for just 

2993
01:59:17,591 --> 01:59:18,424
about any excuse he could find to stiff 
everyone from plumbers to can't make 

2994
01:59:22,421 --> 01:59:23,254
this up.
Lawyers who represented him and 

2995
01:59:24,821 --> 01:59:27,490
nonpayment lawsuits.
That's kind of fun.

2996
01:59:27,491 --> 01:59:28,324
It's kind of boss.
Every bad story about trump has a 

2997
01:59:30,461 --> 01:59:32,510
punchline and that just makes you think 
fat.

2998
01:59:33,430 --> 01:59:36,910
At least 60 lawsuits along with hundreds
of Liens,

2999
01:59:36,911 --> 01:59:40,060
judgments and other government filings 
reviewed by USA Today.

3000
01:59:40,061 --> 01:59:40,894
Network document.
People who have accused trump and his 

3001
01:59:42,881 --> 01:59:47,881
businesses of failing to pay for their 
work and any it doesn't sound goes on.

3002
01:59:48,090 --> 01:59:49,690
It doesn't sound good.
I'm not going to defend that.

3003
01:59:49,840 --> 01:59:50,673
Good.
Thank you.

3004
01:59:50,730 --> 01:59:52,150
Um,
that doesn't sound good at all.

3005
01:59:52,151 --> 01:59:52,980
I,
I,

3006
01:59:52,980 --> 01:59:54,760
I have a quiet,
close follower of trump.

3007
01:59:54,761 --> 01:59:55,810
I didn't know that.
So I will,

3008
01:59:55,811 --> 01:59:58,210
I will look into this,
a mom and that my dishwasher in Florida,

3009
01:59:58,211 --> 02:00:00,220
Glass Company in New Jersey,
a carpet company,

3010
02:00:00,221 --> 02:00:01,150
a plumber,
painters,

3011
02:00:01,330 --> 02:00:05,350
48 waiters,
14 waiters of lawsuits that God,

3012
02:00:05,560 --> 02:00:07,300
I mean it's him.
I think,

3013
02:00:07,301 --> 02:00:08,134
you know,
dozens of bartenders and other hourly 

3014
02:00:09,491 --> 02:00:11,950
workers at resorts and clubs east.
When you run,

3015
02:00:12,020 --> 02:00:13,680
when you want to imply,
you know,

3016
02:00:13,690 --> 02:00:16,300
this is $1 billion empire,
you're going to get things like this.

3017
02:00:16,300 --> 02:00:19,400
And when you do it for decades,
it's not going to be difficult.

3018
02:00:19,450 --> 02:00:20,040
I mean,
the Washington,

3019
02:00:20,040 --> 02:00:22,450
Richard Branson doesn't have those one 
to let me know,

3020
02:00:22,451 --> 02:00:23,284
but if he ran for president,
we might find out that you would have 

3021
02:00:24,551 --> 02:00:25,150
to,
you know,

3022
02:00:25,150 --> 02:00:27,310
cause he's not that kind of guy.
Oh please.

3023
02:00:27,610 --> 02:00:30,000
He's a very altruistic guy,
is he don't,

3024
02:00:30,130 --> 02:00:31,000
she is.
No,

3025
02:00:31,001 --> 02:00:34,240
I think Richard Branson is one of the 
worst examples of a sort of,

3026
02:00:34,241 --> 02:00:35,470
um,
you know,

3027
02:00:35,500 --> 02:00:38,410
quiet power bond,
this globalist elite that wants to break

3028
02:00:38,411 --> 02:00:40,060
down borders and destroy all our 
countries.

3029
02:00:40,061 --> 02:00:42,370
Richard Branson is about as close to the
devils.

3030
02:00:42,371 --> 02:00:44,720
It's possible to get a no,
no.

3031
02:00:44,721 --> 02:00:46,750
I do know impression of him.
Oh,

3032
02:00:46,751 --> 02:00:47,341
come on.
Oh,

3033
02:00:47,341 --> 02:00:49,450
Neca island,
the guests he has at necker island.

3034
02:00:49,451 --> 02:00:50,710
Do you even read this stuff?
I mean,

3035
02:00:50,711 --> 02:00:51,544
for somebody who's,
you know,

3036
02:00:51,910 --> 02:00:54,820
what's Necker island?
Richard Branson's island,

3037
02:00:54,821 --> 02:00:56,860
where he lives this wonderful guy.

3038
02:00:56,860 --> 02:00:57,850
You know so much about,
well,

3039
02:00:57,851 --> 02:00:58,684
why?
I don't know about where he lives and 

3040
02:00:59,651 --> 02:01:03,550
just nobody's business.
What does he do much evidently?

3041
02:01:03,551 --> 02:01:05,140
Cause that's where he strikes all these 
deals.

3042
02:01:05,170 --> 02:01:05,920
But I mean,
what does it,

3043
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:10,920
what's so awful revisit the subject of 
Richard Branson on his island?

3044
02:01:11,330 --> 02:01:13,120
Well,
just the guest to see has on this island

3045
02:01:13,121 --> 02:01:14,940
very suspect.
The globalist.

3046
02:01:14,960 --> 02:01:15,251
It's,
I mean,

3047
02:01:15,251 --> 02:01:16,930
it's basically like build a book,
you know,

3048
02:01:16,970 --> 02:01:17,321
little,
little,

3049
02:01:17,321 --> 02:01:18,160
little,
little,

3050
02:01:18,220 --> 02:01:18,851
little,
you know,

3051
02:01:18,851 --> 02:01:20,550
politicians,
Bang.

3052
02:01:21,700 --> 02:01:26,700
Nice feeds them some guava smoothies.
I just can't,

3053
02:01:26,980 --> 02:01:28,880
I just can't relate to them.
I just hair.

3054
02:01:28,881 --> 02:01:32,500
He is disgusting.
Collin control wearing flip flops on the

3055
02:01:32,501 --> 02:01:34,690
roof from his own fucking island.
What a madman.

3056
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:35,740
Paula,
I just,

3057
02:01:35,800 --> 02:01:37,390
I just couldn't relate to ginger's.
I'm sorry.

3058
02:01:37,600 --> 02:01:39,590
Oh,
how dare you.

3059
02:01:40,850 --> 02:01:41,451
I mean,
he did,

3060
02:01:41,451 --> 02:01:46,120
but he seems to have a very positive and
a very inspirational message.

3061
02:01:46,120 --> 02:01:47,720
It's good at branding himself that way.
Yes.

3062
02:01:48,070 --> 02:01:50,480
You think it's all bullshit?
Well,

3063
02:01:50,481 --> 02:01:52,660
you're looking at me sideways.
I'm just asking you an honest question.

3064
02:01:52,670 --> 02:01:53,503
Just have these weird,
like I listen to you all the time 

3065
02:01:54,981 --> 02:01:57,140
because I find your conversations with 
people.

3066
02:01:57,141 --> 02:01:59,510
Very interesting.
You just have these weird,

3067
02:01:59,600 --> 02:01:59,961
no,
there was,

3068
02:01:59,961 --> 02:02:01,790
this was,
this was an uncomplicated sandwich,

3069
02:02:01,791 --> 02:02:03,050
so don't think we yet.
Okay.

3070
02:02:03,080 --> 02:02:03,890
Thank you.
Anyway,

3071
02:02:03,890 --> 02:02:08,430
by the way,
my favorite story.

3072
02:02:08,540 --> 02:02:09,373
Okay.
He wins.

3073
02:02:09,890 --> 02:02:12,350
Look at her.
My favorite real well,

3074
02:02:12,351 --> 02:02:14,720
he wins.
He's got this naked girl on his back and

3075
02:02:14,721 --> 02:02:15,554
she's,
uh,

3076
02:02:15,580 --> 02:02:19,610
she's not any less pit of degenerate 
sexual encounters.

3077
02:02:19,611 --> 02:02:20,444
Necker island.
You mean he's balling out of control 

3078
02:02:22,701 --> 02:02:23,780
tubs every day.
He's like,

3079
02:02:23,781 --> 02:02:25,700
he's like I said a shit damn bull's area
and you know,

3080
02:02:25,701 --> 02:02:29,180
he's like Dan was Dan Bilzerian without 
the personality,

3081
02:02:29,330 --> 02:02:31,190
you know.
Okay.

3082
02:02:31,910 --> 02:02:33,380
Anyway,
so what's wrong with,

3083
02:02:33,381 --> 02:02:34,214
by the way,
the compliment question that that's not 

3084
02:02:37,461 --> 02:02:38,840
a real thing and compliment sandwich.

3085
02:02:39,140 --> 02:02:39,973
No.
Um,

3086
02:02:40,400 --> 02:02:41,233
the,
my favorite story about Jennifer Lopez 

3087
02:02:42,201 --> 02:02:43,670
ever,
and I don't know if it's true,

3088
02:02:43,820 --> 02:02:46,220
but I'm thinking of like making people 
do this with me now,

3089
02:02:46,300 --> 02:02:47,620
um,
is,

3090
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:48,513
you know,
she was,

3091
02:02:48,680 --> 02:02:50,210
I don't know if it's true.
I hope it's true.

3092
02:02:50,390 --> 02:02:51,980
It's one of those stories like Mariah 
Carey is like,

3093
02:02:51,981 --> 02:02:52,421
you know,
Oh,

3094
02:02:52,421 --> 02:02:54,560
I'd love to be talking about Africa.
You know,

3095
02:02:54,561 --> 02:02:56,780
I'd love to be thin like that,
but not with all the flies and death and

3096
02:02:56,781 --> 02:02:57,920
stuff.
That's not true.

3097
02:02:57,921 --> 02:03:02,420
She never said that she should have said
it a hilarious no,

3098
02:03:02,590 --> 02:03:04,760
it is good.
Like the justine sacco quote,

3099
02:03:05,690 --> 02:03:07,180
she was that woman that got fired.
Oh yeah,

3100
02:03:07,190 --> 02:03:07,611
yeah,
yeah.

3101
02:03:07,611 --> 02:03:08,510
The AIDS joke.
Yeah.

3102
02:03:08,520 --> 02:03:09,201
Yeah.
It was just kidding.

3103
02:03:09,201 --> 02:03:10,850
I'm not white.
I'm just kidding.

3104
02:03:10,851 --> 02:03:12,980
I'm white.
I hope I don't get aids.

3105
02:03:12,981 --> 02:03:13,814
Just kidding.
I'm white.

3106
02:03:14,030 --> 02:03:15,350
Fairly funny.
It's funny.

3107
02:03:15,351 --> 02:03:16,020
Fairly fun.
I'm,

3108
02:03:16,020 --> 02:03:16,410
it's funny.

3109
02:03:16,410 --> 02:03:17,000
Yeah,
I thought so.

3110
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:18,350
I thought so.
It's inappropriate.

3111
02:03:18,351 --> 02:03:19,890
That's why it's funny.
Few Gorka,

3112
02:03:20,750 --> 02:03:21,583
I liked this,
this fee for Jennifer Lopez thing and I 

3113
02:03:23,361 --> 02:03:25,040
hope it's true.
Where she's like,

3114
02:03:25,110 --> 02:03:26,380
she,
she cuts off and integrate.

3115
02:03:26,381 --> 02:03:27,470
She says,
you don't do this very often.

3116
02:03:27,471 --> 02:03:28,304
Do you?
And he's like,

3117
02:03:28,490 --> 02:03:29,180
what?
And she's like,

3118
02:03:29,180 --> 02:03:30,230
compliment,
compliment,

3119
02:03:30,231 --> 02:03:32,600
question.
And he just looked so hard,

3120
02:03:33,320 --> 02:03:34,400
isn't it?
Of course they're real,

3121
02:03:34,401 --> 02:03:35,420
isn't it?
I hope so.

3122
02:03:35,480 --> 02:03:36,440
I hope so too.
Isn't it?

3123
02:03:36,441 --> 02:03:38,030
Great compliment,
compliment,

3124
02:03:38,031 --> 02:03:39,980
compliment question.
I make my,

3125
02:03:39,981 --> 02:03:40,814
I make my assistant do that now 
sometimes when people are interviewing 

3126
02:03:42,441 --> 02:03:43,274
me like just to fuck with them at the 
beginning to get them on a back foot 

3127
02:03:46,040 --> 02:03:48,170
because they don't quite have the balls 
to,

3128
02:03:48,171 --> 02:03:49,310
cause I was like,
I'm not a star.

3129
02:03:49,311 --> 02:03:50,150
Like I'm just like,
you know,

3130
02:03:50,151 --> 02:03:52,400
I made a little name for myself in the 
campus stuff and I'm like,

3131
02:03:52,401 --> 02:03:54,070
people know me quite well as a 
journalist and the rest of it,

3132
02:03:54,440 --> 02:03:55,273
you know,
I'm becoming popular but I'm not there 

3133
02:03:57,051 --> 02:03:57,861
yet.
I'm not,

3134
02:03:57,861 --> 02:03:58,694
we're not,
we're not at Joe Rogan levels of 

3135
02:03:59,451 --> 02:04:03,110
notoriety yet compliment.
But I get him to do it because even even

3136
02:04:03,111 --> 02:04:06,170
with my sort of lowly profile such as it
is,

3137
02:04:07,100 --> 02:04:10,010
people still aren't quite comfortable,
confident calling me out on it.

3138
02:04:10,011 --> 02:04:11,630
And they were,
they're not brave enough to laugh.

3139
02:04:11,870 --> 02:04:14,000
So I have my assistant just interrupted.
Sorry.

3140
02:04:14,030 --> 02:04:14,690
Sorry.
Sorry.

3141
02:04:14,690 --> 02:04:16,520
Could you just compliment,
compliment question.

3142
02:04:20,160 --> 02:04:23,030
I'd love to see the look on their face 
and they fucking process of that.

3143
02:04:23,031 --> 02:04:24,290
Why did they go do it?
It's great.

3144
02:04:24,320 --> 02:04:25,400
It's great.
It's great.

3145
02:04:25,610 --> 02:04:28,400
They just freeze and then they do it and
then they do it.

3146
02:04:28,460 --> 02:04:29,330
They have to,
you know,

3147
02:04:29,900 --> 02:04:31,730
I love your work.
You're really great.

3148
02:04:31,731 --> 02:04:34,810
And your hair looks nice today.
Can I just ask you about see easy,

3149
02:04:35,380 --> 02:04:37,200
not hard,
easy anyways,

3150
02:04:37,710 --> 02:04:39,050
anyway.
Um,

3151
02:04:39,390 --> 02:04:39,871
yes.
No,

3152
02:04:39,871 --> 02:04:41,130
I was going to say,
you have these weird,

3153
02:04:41,160 --> 02:04:43,410
you're like,
you're like the most skeptical person in

3154
02:04:43,411 --> 02:04:45,480
some regards and you'll be like,
no.

3155
02:04:45,481 --> 02:04:47,070
Like,
you're like a truffle hound.

3156
02:04:47,100 --> 02:04:47,970
You know,
you want to get down,

3157
02:04:48,240 --> 02:04:51,840
try and you want to what?
A truffle hound is a very,

3158
02:04:51,841 --> 02:04:54,030
very obscure reference.
Well,

3159
02:04:54,031 --> 02:04:55,830
not if you had a lot of truffles.
No.

3160
02:04:55,831 --> 02:04:56,664
I,
um,

3161
02:04:56,910 --> 02:04:57,743
that,
that's what they use in Italy to pick 

3162
02:04:58,741 --> 02:04:59,300
them up.

3163
02:04:59,300 --> 02:05:00,750
They use truffle hounds.
Do you know that?

3164
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:01,321
Yes.
Yeah.

3165
02:05:01,321 --> 02:05:02,610
Sometimes these pigs too,
right?

3166
02:05:02,670 --> 02:05:03,660
They do.
They use pigs too.

3167
02:05:03,690 --> 02:05:05,390
But pink sometimes have a habit of 
eating,

3168
02:05:05,820 --> 02:05:06,720
eating the truffles.
Indeed.

3169
02:05:06,760 --> 02:05:08,670
Set truffle anchors.
Dogs don't like truffles.

3170
02:05:09,240 --> 02:05:09,900
Uh,
no.

3171
02:05:09,900 --> 02:05:11,010
You're like a truffle hound,
you know,

3172
02:05:11,011 --> 02:05:11,844
just sort of like rushing around for the
truth and talking about studies and you 

3173
02:05:13,741 --> 02:05:14,311
know,
way,

3174
02:05:14,311 --> 02:05:17,400
way higher standard of debate and 
conversation than you normally here,

3175
02:05:17,401 --> 02:05:18,234
you know,
and these kinds of on these kinds of 

3176
02:05:18,781 --> 02:05:19,321
shows,
you know,

3177
02:05:19,321 --> 02:05:21,930
this is why we are so popular.
And then sometimes you're just like,

3178
02:05:21,931 --> 02:05:22,764
no,
he's a really nice guy.

3179
02:05:23,590 --> 02:05:25,770
He seems like a nice guy.
You didn't say.

3180
02:05:25,771 --> 02:05:29,070
Seems you didn't say seems and Ian and 
you didn't know about,

3181
02:05:29,080 --> 02:05:31,770
should brands didn't know about necker 
island on the name of his island?

3182
02:05:31,771 --> 02:05:32,700
No,
he owns an island.

3183
02:05:32,701 --> 02:05:33,640
Me,
he owns a lot of shit.

3184
02:05:33,640 --> 02:05:35,330
He owns Virgin Airlines.
Well why do you think you said no?

3185
02:05:35,900 --> 02:05:38,190
Why do you ever fly virgin?
Yes,

3186
02:05:38,220 --> 02:05:40,980
it's virgin.
Atlantic's very upper class is good.

3187
02:05:41,010 --> 02:05:41,843
It's a good song when they tell you the 
fucking seat belt thing and they have 

3188
02:05:44,581 --> 02:05:47,040
that nice bar that it's lovely.
It's very,

3189
02:05:47,041 --> 02:05:47,861
very good.
Very good.

3190
02:05:47,861 --> 02:05:49,700
An Interior is nice.
Do you know frank?

3191
02:05:49,760 --> 02:05:50,593
I,
on the rare occasions that I had to fly 

3192
02:05:51,151 --> 02:05:52,020
coach,
um,

3193
02:05:52,110 --> 02:05:55,230
I always try to do on virgin cause even 
even economy on virgin is quite nice.

3194
02:05:55,250 --> 02:05:56,370
Yeah.
They're nice plans.

3195
02:05:56,400 --> 02:05:57,780
He's got it nailed.
Yeah.

3196
02:05:57,781 --> 02:05:58,381
Good.
But,

3197
02:05:58,381 --> 02:06:00,450
but probably not a nice guy.
Uh,

3198
02:06:00,660 --> 02:06:02,400
who knows,
not us.

3199
02:06:02,401 --> 02:06:06,630
He seems like if I had to pick out like 
the philanthropic,

3200
02:06:07,280 --> 02:06:09,170
well surely there's Bill Gates.
Yes.

3201
02:06:09,210 --> 02:06:10,670
He's a nice guy too.
Yeah.

3202
02:06:10,710 --> 02:06:13,500
I think Bill Gates is a nice guy.
He seems to be a very nice guy.

3203
02:06:13,530 --> 02:06:14,670
He seems cool.
Yeah.

3204
02:06:14,671 --> 02:06:19,671
Well he does a lot of legitimate charity
work and donates millions and you one of

3205
02:06:19,831 --> 02:06:20,664
these people that you can afford to at 
that level mean it's all right off for 

3206
02:06:24,511 --> 02:06:26,430
him for sure.
But I think bill,

3207
02:06:26,680 --> 02:06:29,580
the bill and Melinda Gates thing,
that is genuinely what they do now.

3208
02:06:29,790 --> 02:06:31,050
You know,
that's their life now.

3209
02:06:32,240 --> 02:06:35,340
They're trying to really like fix things
like malaria and all the rest of it.

3210
02:06:35,580 --> 02:06:36,151
Beautiful.
Yeah,

3211
02:06:36,151 --> 02:06:37,050
no it is.
It's great.

3212
02:06:37,080 --> 02:06:37,691
It's great.
And,

3213
02:06:37,691 --> 02:06:38,490
and you know,
it's,

3214
02:06:38,490 --> 02:06:39,323
it's interesting.
I can't think of another example of 

3215
02:06:41,131 --> 02:06:41,964
somebody who was so hated for like two 
decades as he was when he was running 

3216
02:06:45,061 --> 02:06:45,894
Microsoft.
So completely successfully reversed 

3217
02:06:48,161 --> 02:06:50,310
there and reputation in just 15 years.
You know,

3218
02:06:50,410 --> 02:06:54,070
there's an interesting,
totally and completely one 80.

3219
02:06:54,130 --> 02:06:55,080
His,
his,

3220
02:06:55,110 --> 02:06:56,040
uh,
public,

3221
02:06:56,170 --> 02:06:57,120
uh,
reputation.

3222
02:06:57,660 --> 02:06:58,680
Yeah.
How did they do that?

3223
02:06:58,800 --> 02:06:59,633
One of the things he did,
I think sincerity and intelligence and 

3224
02:07:02,431 --> 02:07:03,264
you know,
he just started speaking honestly and 

3225
02:07:04,711 --> 02:07:06,330
plainly,
and he did less but better.

3226
02:07:06,331 --> 02:07:07,770
He wasn't,
he wasn't a fame whore.

3227
02:07:07,980 --> 02:07:10,020
He wasn't demanding attention.
He just said,

3228
02:07:10,350 --> 02:07:11,183
here's what I'm going to,
here's what I'm going to do in my life 

3229
02:07:12,121 --> 02:07:12,954
now,
and spoke simply and seriously and 

3230
02:07:14,341 --> 02:07:17,230
actually did things.
And who's that crazy guy that he had run

3231
02:07:17,240 --> 02:07:18,061
his company,
the big,

3232
02:07:18,061 --> 02:07:20,100
fat,
Bald Guy when run Roma bomber,

3233
02:07:20,130 --> 02:07:25,130
I lot around screaming and yelling and 
he's sweating and he's out.

3234
02:07:27,560 --> 02:07:28,650
It looks good.
I love,

3235
02:07:28,890 --> 02:07:31,170
I love Steve Former.
I loved him.

3236
02:07:31,200 --> 02:07:32,033
That video is off God damn classic.
But if I worked for Microsoft would be 

3237
02:07:35,261 --> 02:07:36,070
terrified.
I'm like,

3238
02:07:36,070 --> 02:07:36,903
I have to,
I have to muster up this level of 

3239
02:07:38,561 --> 02:07:40,120
enthusiasm.
Although I get fired.

3240
02:07:40,121 --> 02:07:40,960
Yeah,
there he is.

3241
02:07:40,961 --> 02:07:41,794
Look at this.

3242
02:07:41,950 --> 02:07:44,160
Yeah,
the monkey something.

3243
02:07:49,750 --> 02:07:50,950
I love him.
I love him.

3244
02:07:51,890 --> 02:07:52,723
This is nuts.
He's still like this because there's 

3245
02:07:54,081 --> 02:07:54,914
this,
there's a video of him like at 

3246
02:07:55,791 --> 02:07:58,760
basketball games and he's like this in 
the front row in the basketball game.

3247
02:07:59,340 --> 02:08:00,400
He's,
this is just who he is.

3248
02:08:00,750 --> 02:08:02,740
Bruce from sterling.
Yeah.

3249
02:08:02,950 --> 02:08:04,390
Oh that's right.
Yes.

3250
02:08:04,420 --> 02:08:05,253
He would know that.
He probably orchestrated the fucking 

3251
02:08:06,701 --> 02:08:08,680
wire tap.
It was probably a long chess game.

3252
02:08:09,610 --> 02:08:10,443
That son of a bitch.
That is one of the most bizarre things 

3253
02:08:12,221 --> 02:08:14,080
ever because if you listen to what that 
guy said,

3254
02:08:14,081 --> 02:08:17,170
that cost him the clippers.
That is one of the weirdest.

3255
02:08:17,220 --> 02:08:21,610
And you're wondering outside my area,
Donald Sterling was the guy.

3256
02:08:21,640 --> 02:08:22,990
Well it,
it enters into your area.

3257
02:08:23,200 --> 02:08:23,951
Tell me about the,
tell me about it.

3258
02:08:23,951 --> 02:08:24,784
Cause it deals with social justice.
He was a clippers owner to one of the 

3259
02:08:28,361 --> 02:08:29,680
bigger basketball teams,
right?

3260
02:08:29,940 --> 02:08:32,180
The Los Angeles area.
Um,

3261
02:08:32,230 --> 02:08:33,063
he has his girlfriend and he says,
I don't want you taking pictures as 

3262
02:08:37,031 --> 02:08:37,864
black guys because she takes a lot of 
pictures of these black guys on her 

3263
02:08:39,731 --> 02:08:40,870
instagram page.
He goes,

3264
02:08:40,990 --> 02:08:41,823
I don't mind if you fuck them,
but I don't want you taking pictures 

3265
02:08:45,400 --> 02:08:45,820
now.

3266
02:08:45,820 --> 02:08:49,750
They conveniently left out.
They conveniently left out the,

3267
02:08:50,050 --> 02:08:50,883
I don't care if you fuck them,
I just don't because it embarrassed him 

3268
02:08:53,801 --> 02:08:56,560
because everybody knew it was his 
girlfriend and she fucks everybody.

3269
02:08:56,590 --> 02:08:57,423
Yeah.
So she's got pictures with all these 

3270
02:08:58,211 --> 02:08:59,670
stud athletes,
right?

3271
02:08:59,830 --> 02:09:04,180
Everyone knows these shut athletes or 
bone in her writing a trainer is Tim.

3272
02:09:04,440 --> 02:09:06,010
He said,
I don't like you taking pictures.

3273
02:09:06,011 --> 02:09:08,540
What'd you show me there?
So here it goes.

3274
02:09:08,560 --> 02:09:09,393
Bothered me a lot that you want to 
broadcast that you're associating with 

3275
02:09:12,131 --> 02:09:12,964
black people.
Do you have to the man believing to be 

3276
02:09:14,471 --> 02:09:17,860
sterling says you can sleep with them.
You could bring them in,

3277
02:09:17,861 --> 02:09:18,694
you could do whatever you want.
The little I ask you is not to promote 

3278
02:09:21,311 --> 02:09:24,310
it on and not to bring them to my games.

3279
02:09:24,490 --> 02:09:26,310
That's nice.
That's him just saying,

3280
02:09:26,311 --> 02:09:28,320
please don't humiliate me because you 
know,

3281
02:09:28,410 --> 02:09:30,600
you,
you're my girlfriend.

3282
02:09:30,650 --> 02:09:32,160
Yes.
And um,

3283
02:09:32,280 --> 02:09:35,430
you are ritually humiliating me in 
public,

3284
02:09:35,470 --> 02:09:36,960
but,
and he's just asking her not to do it,

3285
02:09:36,990 --> 02:09:40,410
but she specifically said black eyes.
Like what if she brought in some fucking

3286
02:09:40,411 --> 02:09:44,180
vikings,
giant bearded ax wielding.

3287
02:09:45,050 --> 02:09:47,130
It's a complement to the black people 
because he's,

3288
02:09:47,160 --> 02:09:49,830
he's identifying them as like a,
as the master race they are.

3289
02:09:50,140 --> 02:09:51,180
Um,
and he's like,

3290
02:09:51,181 --> 02:09:52,014
you know,
I'm just some little white guy and you 

3291
02:09:52,861 --> 02:09:53,694
keep going out with these like massive 
six foot four athletes and you're 

3292
02:09:55,561 --> 02:09:57,030
humiliating me.
Please stop it.

3293
02:09:57,060 --> 02:09:57,893
Yeah.
And obviously if she was a coal burner 

3294
02:09:59,080 --> 02:09:59,913
and she's just going out and fucking 
black guys and she's just got coal 

3295
02:10:02,250 --> 02:10:04,470
burner and so what they call them?
Yeah.

3296
02:10:04,780 --> 02:10:06,770
Or,
or a snicker liquor.

3297
02:10:08,330 --> 02:10:09,960
Put a Kolber.
Yeah.

3298
02:10:10,200 --> 02:10:11,490
Holy Shit.
That's funny.

3299
02:10:11,670 --> 02:10:13,710
Or a a loco,
which is the other one I left too.

3300
02:10:13,720 --> 02:10:14,620
It's a good one.
Yeah.

3301
02:10:14,640 --> 02:10:16,850
Like that,
but not as much as Colbert and corden.

3302
02:10:16,851 --> 02:10:19,710
It's just like an old nowhere.
I got it.

3303
02:10:19,711 --> 02:10:22,830
I think it might be something like 1940 
is racist thing,

3304
02:10:23,160 --> 02:10:25,980
but I'm going to reclaim it because I'm 
a allowed because I am one.

3305
02:10:25,981 --> 02:10:26,641
That's the rule,
right?

3306
02:10:26,641 --> 02:10:27,660
Yeah.
That's the rule these days.

3307
02:10:27,690 --> 02:10:29,480
That's the rule these days in coal 
burner,

3308
02:10:29,481 --> 02:10:30,330
sir.
Yes.

3309
02:10:30,570 --> 02:10:31,403
That's the rule these days.
I can say whatever I want as long as I 

3310
02:10:32,611 --> 02:10:33,780
am it.
Um,

3311
02:10:33,870 --> 02:10:34,200
no,

3312
02:10:34,200 --> 02:10:35,033
she's only fucking black guys and she's 
not really putting out for rich white 

3313
02:10:37,881 --> 02:10:41,120
husband and he's boyfriend.
She has a water,

3314
02:10:41,121 --> 02:10:43,130
he has a wife.
Who Cares?

3315
02:10:43,250 --> 02:10:45,140
Who Cares?
This is example of the media,

3316
02:10:45,141 --> 02:10:45,641
right?
And just,

3317
02:10:45,641 --> 02:10:46,474
just cherry picking to say that everyone
is racist when everyone's not racist 

3318
02:10:49,071 --> 02:10:52,640
because his primary motivation in this 
statement had nothing to do with race.

3319
02:10:52,970 --> 02:10:54,740
And you could say,
why did he need to say black at all?

3320
02:10:54,741 --> 02:10:55,574
But who cares?
That wasn't what he was asking her 

3321
02:10:57,111 --> 02:10:57,944
about.
It wasn't the thrust of his remarks and 

3322
02:10:59,661 --> 02:11:01,910
the media because it is populated by 
children,

3323
02:11:01,940 --> 02:11:03,660
not by adults.
Uh,

3324
02:11:03,680 --> 02:11:05,000
did this to him.
If it sounds like,

3325
02:11:05,001 --> 02:11:05,381
I mean,
I don't know,

3326
02:11:05,381 --> 02:11:06,890
I'm speculating.
The literal,

3327
02:11:06,891 --> 02:11:09,140
literally the tiny bit you just told me.
But um,

3328
02:11:09,170 --> 02:11:10,450
but it doesn't sound,
it doesn't seem,

3329
02:11:10,460 --> 02:11:12,980
it sounds to me to be in your words,
problematic.

3330
02:11:13,010 --> 02:11:13,401
Yeah.
And well,

3331
02:11:13,401 --> 02:11:14,234
here's another issue with it.
It was a private conversation that he 

3332
02:11:16,401 --> 02:11:17,234
did not think was being broadcast.
And people are allowed to say fucked up 

3333
02:11:20,061 --> 02:11:24,050
things that maybe they shouldn't have 
said and it doesn't have to be shared to

3334
02:11:24,051 --> 02:11:26,900
the whole world.
And then he loses his team.

3335
02:11:27,740 --> 02:11:30,650
This is the craziest part about people 
bastards.

3336
02:11:30,651 --> 02:11:33,710
The president of the NBA makes his 
speech,

3337
02:11:33,711 --> 02:11:35,210
first of all,
it looks like Nosferatu.

3338
02:11:35,330 --> 02:11:37,280
Right?
He looks like he just fucking,

3339
02:11:37,400 --> 02:11:39,170
the guy,
old president president,

3340
02:11:39,350 --> 02:11:40,183
he looks like you popped out of a coffin
and he sits straight up and he reads 

3341
02:11:45,261 --> 02:11:46,094
this fucking canned ridiculous speech 
about the horrors of what this guy look 

3342
02:11:50,841 --> 02:11:54,070
at him.
Look at Nosferatu wow.

3343
02:11:55,590 --> 02:11:57,110
No,
no white to his eyes.

3344
02:11:57,111 --> 02:11:59,450
It's all black.
You wouldn't see him out in sunlight.

3345
02:11:59,451 --> 02:12:00,380
Right.
That's a demon.

3346
02:12:01,130 --> 02:12:04,820
Even of the white stuff is all red blood
behind.

3347
02:12:05,630 --> 02:12:07,850
He's scary.
He's like a pure blood.

3348
02:12:07,851 --> 02:12:10,370
You know the ones that are like Paler 
and older than are the vows.

3349
02:12:10,980 --> 02:12:12,290
He wasn't,
he wasn't made.

3350
02:12:12,291 --> 02:12:14,170
He was born,
born vampire.

3351
02:12:14,210 --> 02:12:15,043
Right,
right.

3352
02:12:15,350 --> 02:12:16,610
Yeah.
And Anyway,

3353
02:12:16,620 --> 02:12:20,780
he was very unreasonable the way he 
described it.

3354
02:12:20,781 --> 02:12:23,690
Look with what the guy said was not 
nice.

3355
02:12:23,930 --> 02:12:25,610
It was sorted.
It was gross,

3356
02:12:25,640 --> 02:12:28,550
but more gross.
I would have said if I was him,

3357
02:12:28,700 --> 02:12:29,533
how gross is it that we're listening to 
this man's private conversation and 

3358
02:12:32,301 --> 02:12:33,134
judge him?
I want people to say this stuff in 

3359
02:12:34,221 --> 02:12:35,300
public.
Not only that,

3360
02:12:35,301 --> 02:12:36,620
the guy was drunk,
okay.

3361
02:12:36,621 --> 02:12:38,240
He was drunk.
He was with his mistress.

3362
02:12:38,270 --> 02:12:39,710
I didn't care about anything.
He said,

3363
02:12:39,740 --> 02:12:41,690
that seems completely reasonable 
statement to me.

3364
02:12:41,900 --> 02:12:44,180
Well,
you're allowed to say fucked up things.

3365
02:12:44,230 --> 02:12:45,770
Okay?
If you'll go from cheating on you with a

3366
02:12:45,771 --> 02:12:47,810
bunch of black guys,
you would not say,

3367
02:12:48,320 --> 02:12:50,030
why are you cheating on with me?
All these guys,

3368
02:12:50,180 --> 02:12:51,380
you would say,
no,

3369
02:12:51,381 --> 02:12:52,070
but listen,
isn't it?

3370
02:12:52,070 --> 02:12:53,570
If you,
if you had a girlfriend,

3371
02:12:53,571 --> 02:12:53,970
of course.
No,

3372
02:12:53,970 --> 02:12:54,381
go,
go,

3373
02:12:54,381 --> 02:12:55,880
whatever.
Cheat on you because look at you.

3374
02:12:55,881 --> 02:12:57,080
But Oh,
so it was nice.

3375
02:12:57,120 --> 02:12:58,090
I know,
I know.

3376
02:12:58,670 --> 02:13:01,220
My boss now is so,
so used to these,

3377
02:13:01,310 --> 02:13:04,340
um,
these sort of a flippant compliments.

3378
02:13:04,341 --> 02:13:06,260
He now no longer believes.
Then he says,

3379
02:13:06,261 --> 02:13:08,480
you have to give me the same exact 
compliment three times,

3380
02:13:08,481 --> 02:13:12,230
so I know you actually mean it because 
he's a three.

3381
02:13:12,231 --> 02:13:14,810
Compliments,
compliments and then a statement.

3382
02:13:15,370 --> 02:13:16,101
Yeah,
a compliment,

3383
02:13:16,101 --> 02:13:16,970
compliment,
compliment,

3384
02:13:16,971 --> 02:13:17,804
question.

3385
02:13:20,600 --> 02:13:21,433
He's like,
if you don't give me on three separate 

3386
02:13:22,701 --> 02:13:24,230
occasions,
unrelated,

3387
02:13:24,350 --> 02:13:25,760
unrelated,
separate occasions,

3388
02:13:25,761 --> 02:13:26,810
the same compliment.
I'll know.

3389
02:13:26,811 --> 02:13:28,190
It's just you being flipping a 
flatterer,

3390
02:13:28,550 --> 02:13:29,900
which I think is reasonable,
but no.

3391
02:13:29,990 --> 02:13:32,070
If you had a girlfriend and she

3392
02:13:32,070 --> 02:13:32,903
was cheating on you and she was 
exclusively cheating on you with black 

3393
02:13:35,101 --> 02:13:36,870
guys,
when you had a conversation with her,

3394
02:13:36,930 --> 02:13:39,630
you would not say,
I don't mind you sleeping with all these

3395
02:13:39,631 --> 02:13:41,040
men.
You would say,

3396
02:13:41,340 --> 02:13:42,990
I don't mind you sleeping with all these
black men.

3397
02:13:43,080 --> 02:13:43,913
You would do that.
That's how people talk because it's a 

3398
02:13:45,781 --> 02:13:48,870
group that is very identifiably,
not you and what you're,

3399
02:13:49,100 --> 02:13:51,840
what you're implicitly saying is what is
it that they have that I don't have?

3400
02:13:51,841 --> 02:13:54,870
Well,
obviously that's what's going on there.

3401
02:13:54,900 --> 02:13:55,733
He's being racist.
He's identifying a pattern of behavior 

3402
02:13:58,891 --> 02:14:01,920
from her and it's like that's how we 
would all talk.

3403
02:14:01,950 --> 02:14:04,770
But he specifically broadcast that 
you're with them.

3404
02:14:04,771 --> 02:14:07,900
It's even more bizarre than that.
Puts even more bizarre because,

3405
02:14:08,050 --> 02:14:09,840
cause he said,
I don't mind if you fucked them.

3406
02:14:10,320 --> 02:14:14,010
Isn't that the best fucking boyfriend in
the world is funny too that they bleeped

3407
02:14:14,011 --> 02:14:14,700
out fuck.

3408
02:14:14,700 --> 02:14:19,070
And they put in in parentheses sleep 
with like they change.

3409
02:14:19,260 --> 02:14:21,060
People are dumb.
They change like the,

3410
02:14:21,070 --> 02:14:23,160
like the trend,
like the Orlando transcript,

3411
02:14:23,161 --> 02:14:27,990
which wasn't allowed to have any mention
of Islam or isis whatsoever.

3412
02:14:28,080 --> 02:14:29,640
What do you mean?
Did you know that?

3413
02:14:29,730 --> 02:14:30,421
No,
no.

3414
02:14:30,421 --> 02:14:31,230
The way that people,
this,

3415
02:14:31,230 --> 02:14:33,240
I hate this cause I'm like a free speech
fundamentalist.

3416
02:14:33,241 --> 02:14:34,074
I want people to have conversations like
that and far worse in public all the 

3417
02:14:36,001 --> 02:14:36,834
time.
Everywhere because I want to rob words 

3418
02:14:37,591 --> 02:14:39,150
of their magical powers.
Uh,

3419
02:14:39,310 --> 02:14:41,860
I want to know what people,
what's really going on.

3420
02:14:41,910 --> 02:14:42,743
Really think I want people,
if somebody wants to use the n word 

3421
02:14:45,091 --> 02:14:47,340
because they don't like black people,
I want to know about it.

3422
02:14:47,460 --> 02:14:48,293
I want to know who the racists are.
I want to know who the sexist so I want 

3423
02:14:51,331 --> 02:14:52,050
to know,
cause I wanna be friends.

3424
02:14:52,050 --> 02:14:53,000
I'm kidding.
I'm joking.

3425
02:14:53,020 --> 02:14:53,880
Joking.
Totally joking.

3426
02:14:53,881 --> 02:14:55,020
Very,
very reasonable.

3427
02:14:55,021 --> 02:14:55,854
I want to know people are,
and when you force people to sign up to 

3428
02:14:58,741 --> 02:15:01,230
bogus speech codes,
nobody knows who anyone else's.

3429
02:15:01,290 --> 02:15:05,100
It doesn't change their intent.
And in fact it can make it worse because

3430
02:15:05,101 --> 02:15:06,820
when you press that,
exactly.

3431
02:15:06,821 --> 02:15:07,654
And then we'll open it up and then you 
get drunk for a bottleneck and we're on 

3432
02:15:09,571 --> 02:15:11,100
the same page.
We're on the same page.

3433
02:15:11,340 --> 02:15:12,990
I want all this stuff to happen in 
public.

3434
02:15:13,020 --> 02:15:14,670
I really do.
Yes I do.

3435
02:15:14,820 --> 02:15:16,050
And I was going to say something else,
but I've forgotten.

3436
02:15:16,820 --> 02:15:19,080
Um,
uh,

3437
02:15:20,010 --> 02:15:22,050
oh yes.
I hate this.

3438
02:15:22,051 --> 02:15:23,150
I hate this.
You know,

3439
02:15:23,260 --> 02:15:26,780
this bleeping and censorship stuff,
department of Justice,

3440
02:15:26,800 --> 02:15:30,030
Scrub Islam references for the 
transcripts of the terrorist police.

3441
02:15:30,190 --> 02:15:31,350
You're great.
You're amazing.

3442
02:15:31,351 --> 02:15:34,350
I want to go to find this stuff so fast.
You're saying this is true.

3443
02:15:34,410 --> 02:15:35,243
So,
and then they got ridiculed and 

3444
02:15:35,791 --> 02:15:38,040
humiliated into releasing the actual 
full transcript,

3445
02:15:38,041 --> 02:15:40,680
which I think still wasn't quite there.
But I hate this.

3446
02:15:40,681 --> 02:15:41,514
I hate this instinct to,
I hate any time that people don't quote 

3447
02:15:44,461 --> 02:15:45,930
properly.
Whether it's to like,

3448
02:15:45,960 --> 02:15:46,920
you know,
because Oh god,

3449
02:15:46,921 --> 02:15:47,760
people can't cook.
What's where,

3450
02:15:49,320 --> 02:15:51,000
why would they think that would be okay 
to do?

3451
02:15:51,001 --> 02:15:52,950
Why would the Department of Justice do 
that?

3452
02:15:53,070 --> 02:15:54,540
Because it's an it because I mean,
look,

3453
02:15:54,541 --> 02:15:54,841
it's,
it's,

3454
02:15:54,841 --> 02:15:55,950
you know,
Loretta Lynch,

3455
02:15:55,951 --> 02:15:57,480
the Attorney General,
these people are Democrats.

3456
02:15:57,481 --> 02:15:59,100
They are pandering to Islam.
It's very simple.

3457
02:15:59,130 --> 02:16:00,390
There are pandering to Muslims,

3458
02:16:01,960 --> 02:16:03,370
the pandering to Muslims and 
demonstration.

3459
02:16:03,371 --> 02:16:07,360
They don't give a shit about gay people.
That is bizarre that they would want,

3460
02:16:07,490 --> 02:16:10,210
I don't give a shit to take out the 
references to Islam.

3461
02:16:10,300 --> 02:16:11,680
He described like,
he's like,

3462
02:16:11,681 --> 02:16:12,640
he's like saying,
oh La la,

3463
02:16:12,641 --> 02:16:13,271
la La,
you know,

3464
02:16:13,271 --> 02:16:13,950
like,
you know,

3465
02:16:13,950 --> 02:16:14,561
giving,
doing the,

3466
02:16:14,561 --> 02:16:16,000
doing the Shahada.
God knows what else.

3467
02:16:16,001 --> 02:16:16,401
Saying,
you know,

3468
02:16:16,401 --> 02:16:17,620
in the name of Allah,
most of,

3469
02:16:17,621 --> 02:16:18,550
most of all,
most great,

3470
02:16:18,551 --> 02:16:19,990
I'm doing this terrible thing.
You know,

3471
02:16:19,991 --> 02:16:21,970
I'm doing this for Isis.
I am a proud Muslim.

3472
02:16:22,120 --> 02:16:23,770
I'm killing in the name of Allah and all
the rest of it.

3473
02:16:23,771 --> 02:16:25,630
I think even when they put the 
transcript back,

3474
02:16:25,631 --> 02:16:27,250
I think they changed Allah to God,
you know,

3475
02:16:27,251 --> 02:16:29,770
just to wind up Christians just to Piss 
us off,

3476
02:16:29,771 --> 02:16:30,250
you know,

3477
02:16:30,250 --> 02:16:31,990
just to wind people up.
Um,

3478
02:16:32,020 --> 02:16:33,610
just,
just to sort of muddy the waters,

3479
02:16:33,611 --> 02:16:34,250
you know,
just said,

3480
02:16:34,250 --> 02:16:35,200
oh,
I said religious,

3481
02:16:35,220 --> 02:16:37,210
religious images,
massive.

3482
02:16:37,360 --> 02:16:38,193
That's a massive piece of deception.
It's discuss the words like that course 

3483
02:16:42,070 --> 02:16:42,903
of course,
and the censorship and changing all the 

3484
02:16:44,231 --> 02:16:45,064
rest of it.
But I think that you have the power to 

3485
02:16:46,211 --> 02:16:47,200
do that.
No,

3486
02:16:47,201 --> 02:16:51,190
it's obscene.
That is a direct violation of the press.

3487
02:16:51,430 --> 02:16:52,263
Direct violation of journalism and 
distribute information that's so 

3488
02:16:56,051 --> 02:17:00,900
distorted like that.
Almost worse than the motivations behind

3489
02:17:00,901 --> 02:17:01,734
the fact they did it is the contempt and
low esteem in which they must hold the 

3490
02:17:05,801 --> 02:17:06,634
public and the press to think that,
that we would think that was okay and 

3491
02:17:10,031 --> 02:17:13,990
put up with it and not know what was in 
the gaps that they redacted.

3492
02:17:14,170 --> 02:17:15,640
Yeah.
Have they commented on this?

3493
02:17:15,670 --> 02:17:16,181
No,
they just,

3494
02:17:16,181 --> 02:17:17,014
they got bullied.
They got so ridiculed by all sides that 

3495
02:17:19,091 --> 02:17:23,980
they released a new transcript where 
they think fewer explanations.

3496
02:17:23,980 --> 02:17:25,840
I don't know if it was complete,
complete,

3497
02:17:25,841 --> 02:17:29,380
complete.
It was much better because it was insane

3498
02:17:29,381 --> 02:17:31,330
that they think they could do that.
It's insane.

3499
02:17:31,390 --> 02:17:34,480
Well they didn't get away with it,
but imagine them thinking they could get

3500
02:17:34,481 --> 02:17:35,314
away with it.
What that says about their opinion of 

3501
02:17:37,121 --> 02:17:39,760
the public,
that's almost worse.

3502
02:17:40,390 --> 02:17:41,770
Well,
it's not just that,

3503
02:17:41,771 --> 02:17:43,600
it's the,
their sense of entitlement,

3504
02:17:43,720 --> 02:17:46,810
the amount of power that they think that
they can walk reality.

3505
02:17:46,840 --> 02:17:48,250
Yeah.
I mean that is warping reality.

3506
02:17:48,280 --> 02:17:49,500
Yeah.
It's 100% more pro.

3507
02:17:49,780 --> 02:17:50,940
I mean,
cause it,

3508
02:17:51,040 --> 02:17:51,873
it creates space for people,
for idiots like sally cone to say this 

3509
02:17:54,431 --> 02:17:55,260
was,
you know,

3510
02:17:55,260 --> 02:17:59,140
homophobically motivated fucking wasn't 
a transcript or is it not a transcript,

3511
02:17:59,660 --> 02:18:00,493
the transcript,
you're suppose to be able to hear it on 

3512
02:18:01,230 --> 02:18:03,070
the script.
What the fuck did he say?

3513
02:18:03,190 --> 02:18:04,480
Oh Wow.
That's,

3514
02:18:04,780 --> 02:18:06,790
and they sense it.
Every single mention,

3515
02:18:06,791 --> 02:18:07,990
and this is not like,
you know,

3516
02:18:08,260 --> 02:18:09,093
usual rightwing kind of like,
why aren't your naming Islam kind of 

3517
02:18:11,711 --> 02:18:16,711
stuff for this attorney general,
Loretta Lynch refused Wednesday to say,

3518
02:18:16,901 --> 02:18:17,734
who made the decision to remove 
references to the Islamic state and its 

3519
02:18:19,991 --> 02:18:23,620
leader from the publicly released 
version of the transcript of the nine 11

3520
02:18:23,621 --> 02:18:26,120
call involving the Orlando nightclub 
shooter.

3521
02:18:26,120 --> 02:18:29,710
The goal of course,
what listen to this,

3522
02:18:29,980 --> 02:18:33,130
the goal is of course the greatest 
transparency.

3523
02:18:33,160 --> 02:18:33,993
The initial thought was that we did not 
want to provide a further platform for 

3524
02:18:37,511 --> 02:18:41,080
the propaganda of the killer bull shit.
What a load of crap.

3525
02:18:41,081 --> 02:18:42,850
That's a lie.
Of course it's a lie.

3526
02:18:42,880 --> 02:18:46,240
Of course it became an issue.
We decided we would go ahead and release

3527
02:18:46,241 --> 02:18:47,074
the full transcript.
Lynch said when's she must've released 

3528
02:18:49,541 --> 02:18:50,960
the full one if she said it.
I get,

3529
02:18:50,990 --> 02:18:51,970
I guess,
I guess they have,

3530
02:18:51,971 --> 02:18:53,560
I mean,
God only knows if they,

3531
02:18:53,561 --> 02:18:55,870
if they really did really sit or if they
change certain words,

3532
02:18:55,871 --> 02:18:56,920
who knows.
Uh,

3533
02:18:56,950 --> 02:18:59,680
but um,
that when we have no way of telling,

3534
02:18:59,710 --> 02:19:02,970
and this certainly does not inspire us 
with confidence that even even the,

3535
02:19:03,310 --> 02:19:06,190
even the released one,
look at this statement right here.

3536
02:19:06,550 --> 02:19:07,720
Um,
hold on a second.

3537
02:19:07,721 --> 02:19:08,554
Do we trust them even to have released 
the real one now that we know what 

3538
02:19:10,121 --> 02:19:11,020
they're,
what they're doing.

3539
02:19:11,020 --> 02:19:13,510
Once you say you released the real one,
it's just like,

3540
02:19:13,610 --> 02:19:16,510
it seemed like it's going to get out.
Press on.

3541
02:19:16,511 --> 02:19:21,010
Who decided to remove the references to 
Isol as well as the name of the deceased

3542
02:19:21,011 --> 02:19:22,390
shooter,
Omar Martine.

3543
02:19:22,420 --> 02:19:23,253
Lynn Lynch remained vague.
I'm not going to go into the detail of 

3544
02:19:26,471 --> 02:19:27,304
the process behind it.
Lynch said I review was not to further 

3545
02:19:30,261 --> 02:19:32,730
spread the propaganda,
but once it became a distraction,

3546
02:19:32,731 --> 02:19:33,564
when we release the whole transcript,
what tell me and you know that we know 

3547
02:19:37,161 --> 02:19:38,810
how you know it's a lie,
right?

3548
02:19:39,140 --> 02:19:40,250
I mean,
or at least how,

3549
02:19:40,280 --> 02:19:43,070
you know how stupid these people are.
They release,

3550
02:19:43,100 --> 02:19:43,933
this is the,
this is the deadliest shooting in 

3551
02:19:46,131 --> 02:19:47,150
American history,
right?

3552
02:19:47,151 --> 02:19:48,560
The deadliest mass shooting in American 
history.

3553
02:19:48,561 --> 02:19:51,290
It is the biggest news in the country 
for weeks.

3554
02:19:52,100 --> 02:19:55,820
They released the deadliest mass 
shooting in America.

3555
02:19:55,821 --> 02:19:56,654
It is.
It is,

3556
02:19:56,680 --> 02:19:57,070
it is.

3557
02:19:57,070 --> 02:19:59,940
There was one,
there was showed to other ones that were

3558
02:20:00,440 --> 02:20:02,660
really similar,
which one had more,

3559
02:20:02,840 --> 02:20:03,673
could just google that.
Orlando was not the deadliest mass 

3560
02:20:06,201 --> 02:20:09,750
shooting in American history.
The Google that because there was this,

3561
02:20:09,830 --> 02:20:11,570
what can the assumption is one of the 
top five.

3562
02:20:11,900 --> 02:20:12,770
Um,
this is,

3563
02:20:12,771 --> 02:20:13,280
you know,
this,

3564
02:20:13,280 --> 02:20:14,570
this is horrible.
It was horrible.

3565
02:20:14,571 --> 02:20:16,760
But I'm just,
just for clarity's sake,

3566
02:20:16,761 --> 02:20:18,740
I think I would like to know if I'm 
wrong about that,

3567
02:20:19,070 --> 02:20:20,330
but it just assume that,
you know,

3568
02:20:20,331 --> 02:20:22,160
it's the biggest news story in America 
for three weeks,

3569
02:20:22,190 --> 02:20:23,023
right?
In the eyes of the world media we're 

3570
02:20:24,471 --> 02:20:27,380
watching and this guy dialed nine one 
one right?

3571
02:20:27,680 --> 02:20:31,910
And made a phone call immediately before
or whatever it was,

3572
02:20:31,911 --> 02:20:32,744
you know,
to think that you can gerrymander that 

3573
02:20:37,040 --> 02:20:42,040
is so dumb.
Just so mind bogglingly stupid given the

3574
02:20:42,261 --> 02:20:45,770
suspicion with which normal people 
already hold the authorities,

3575
02:20:45,771 --> 02:20:48,140
you know,
and the politicization swirling around,

3576
02:20:48,141 --> 02:20:49,310
this is so stupid.

3577
02:20:49,490 --> 02:20:52,070
But think also if,
if what she was saying was true,

3578
02:20:52,071 --> 02:20:54,860
right,
what we did this to stop,

3579
02:20:55,300 --> 02:20:56,133
you know,
the spread of his hateful messages and 

3580
02:20:57,561 --> 02:20:58,820
to avoid,
you know,

3581
02:20:58,850 --> 02:21:02,630
more attention beyond Isis.
What's more attention on now?

3582
02:21:02,960 --> 02:21:03,793
Now that funding has gone,
all anyone wants to talk about it in 

3583
02:21:05,301 --> 02:21:07,550
that transcript is the words that she 
kept out.

3584
02:21:08,120 --> 02:21:08,953
All anybody will ever want to talk about
in relation to that transcript for the 

3585
02:21:11,841 --> 02:21:12,674
rest of time is how the government cut 
out the names of Isis and even his own 

3586
02:21:17,361 --> 02:21:17,931
name.
You know,

3587
02:21:17,931 --> 02:21:21,020
like the cutout.
Anything remotely Islamic looking,

3588
02:21:21,170 --> 02:21:24,740
any Arabic words,
anything [inaudible] cleansed it so that

3589
02:21:24,741 --> 02:21:28,520
if you had only read that transcript and
you knew nothing about the case,

3590
02:21:28,730 --> 02:21:30,410
you might think the guy was just some,
you know,

3591
02:21:30,650 --> 02:21:33,800
straight white male homophobic shooter 
from Charleston,

3592
02:21:33,930 --> 02:21:34,910
you know?
Yeah.

3593
02:21:34,911 --> 02:21:36,270
They were trying to hide his name there.

3594
02:21:36,280 --> 02:21:37,790
Exactly.
They a bunch of weird name.

3595
02:21:37,791 --> 02:21:40,610
They hit his name like we didn't know 
his name.

3596
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,130
They hid his name so that if you read 
that document,

3597
02:21:43,460 --> 02:21:46,550
you could have been persuaded to believe
that this was some,

3598
02:21:46,551 --> 02:21:47,540
you know,
redneck,

3599
02:21:47,541 --> 02:21:50,540
homophobic Christian killer,
which of course the left was saying,

3600
02:21:50,541 --> 02:21:51,990
you know,
um,

3601
02:21:53,090 --> 02:21:54,590
oh,
this is no better than blah,

3602
02:21:54,591 --> 02:21:55,071
blah,
blah.

3603
02:21:55,071 --> 02:21:55,904
You know,
all of the kind of like excuse making 

3604
02:21:57,740 --> 02:22:01,190
and molly coddling and pandering and 
weaseling and,

3605
02:22:01,340 --> 02:22:02,450
and Oh,
let's use,

3606
02:22:02,540 --> 02:22:06,290
let's use a Muslim killing gays as an 
excuse to attack the questions again,

3607
02:22:06,500 --> 02:22:07,420
you know,
uh,

3608
02:22:07,460 --> 02:22:09,740
all of this stuff that the left was 
doing,

3609
02:22:09,770 --> 02:22:10,603
the government legitimized and assisted 
when it redacted that transcript 

3610
02:22:15,380 --> 02:22:16,213
appalling.
Well that it's ridiculous to think that 

3611
02:22:18,401 --> 02:22:19,234
they thought they'd get away with it,
but it also shows how much fear they 

3612
02:22:21,291 --> 02:22:24,980
have of Islam and Muslim people.
It's true.

3613
02:22:25,020 --> 02:22:26,460
It's,
there's a massive

3614
02:22:26,460 --> 02:22:27,293
fear in this country and that was the 
same fear that led them to suppress the 

3615
02:22:30,151 --> 02:22:33,120
images from Charlie Abdo that got those 
cartoonists killed.

3616
02:22:33,510 --> 02:22:34,141
Nobody.
I mean,

3617
02:22:34,141 --> 02:22:36,820
there was a massive failure of the press
or no one,

3618
02:22:36,821 --> 02:22:38,010
and we ran them.
You guys,

3619
02:22:38,011 --> 02:22:41,370
Breitbart did,
and Kudos to you because that was a huge

3620
02:22:41,371 --> 02:22:43,050
issue.
And Time magazine,

3621
02:22:43,051 --> 02:22:45,420
The New York Times,
all those people denied.

3622
02:22:45,840 --> 02:22:46,673
They'd be like,
no,

3623
02:22:46,740 --> 02:22:48,020
we're not.
We're not running that.

3624
02:22:48,040 --> 02:22:48,873
We don't want to die.

3625
02:22:48,950 --> 02:22:49,611
Yeah,
yeah,

3626
02:22:49,611 --> 02:22:50,600
we did it.
I knew.

3627
02:22:50,601 --> 02:22:51,500
It's funny.
We always sold,

3628
02:22:51,501 --> 02:22:53,400
you know,
the left is so stunning and brave,

3629
02:22:53,410 --> 02:22:54,860
responsible for all these great,
you know,

3630
02:22:55,220 --> 02:22:56,053
um,
social triumphs and civil rights 

3631
02:22:57,351 --> 02:22:59,360
victories and all the rest of it.
Uh,

3632
02:23:00,020 --> 02:23:00,853
it seems to me that it's,
it's conservative taking all the risks 

3633
02:23:02,991 --> 02:23:04,730
now.
It looks that way to me.

3634
02:23:04,760 --> 02:23:05,593
I mean,
I'm going at the end of the month to 

3635
02:23:06,201 --> 02:23:07,910
Sweden.
I didn't think I told you this.

3636
02:23:08,090 --> 02:23:09,650
You wouldn't know this yet.
Um,

3637
02:23:09,710 --> 02:23:10,543
I'm getting at the end of the month to 
Sweden to lead to gay pride march 

3638
02:23:12,561 --> 02:23:16,190
through a Muslim ghetto because to me 
it's been nice knowing you dude,

3639
02:23:16,220 --> 02:23:17,053
and a black,
glad I got to come on before the end of 

3640
02:23:19,250 --> 02:23:23,120
the month because to me it seems like 
the point of gay pride,

3641
02:23:23,121 --> 02:23:25,000
if there is one any more is,
and it's,

3642
02:23:25,080 --> 02:23:28,350
that's very much in debate in the west.
Uh,

3643
02:23:28,760 --> 02:23:31,580
surely this was the point of gay pride 
was always to,

3644
02:23:31,581 --> 02:23:32,414
you know,
just sort of March defiantly through 

3645
02:23:33,741 --> 02:23:35,900
areas of social conservatism and 
reactionary,

3646
02:23:35,930 --> 02:23:37,580
you know,
religious bigotry in all the rest of it.

3647
02:23:38,540 --> 02:23:39,373
Well,
that's only coming really from one 

3648
02:23:39,981 --> 02:23:43,430
direction.
Now I don't think there's very much,

3649
02:23:44,240 --> 02:23:45,370
I mean it's,
it is an absurd,

3650
02:23:45,440 --> 02:23:46,273
it's an absurd and ridiculous,
lots of perspective to suggest that 

3651
02:23:48,651 --> 02:23:49,484
somebody who doesn't want to bake a cake
for some lesbians is equivalent to a 

3652
02:23:52,071 --> 02:23:54,920
creed that wants to know,
that throws homosexuals off roofs where,

3653
02:23:55,100 --> 02:23:56,810
you know,
100 million people live in,

3654
02:23:56,811 --> 02:23:59,690
in Islamic countries where the penalty 
for gay sex is death.

3655
02:23:59,960 --> 02:24:00,621
Uh,
where,

3656
02:24:00,621 --> 02:24:01,880
you know,
British Muslims,

3657
02:24:01,940 --> 02:24:02,773
100% of British Muslims think that 
homosexuality is not an acceptable 

3658
02:24:05,091 --> 02:24:08,240
lifestyle choice and 52% of them.
What gay sex made illegal.

3659
02:24:08,420 --> 02:24:11,120
This is coming from one religion,
just one,

3660
02:24:11,280 --> 02:24:14,190
and stop lying to people that you know,
that there's some equivalence between,

3661
02:24:14,191 --> 02:24:15,024
you know,
the discomfort occasionally felt by 

3662
02:24:16,101 --> 02:24:19,640
Christians about gay marriage and 
Muslims murdering homosexuals.

3663
02:24:19,641 --> 02:24:22,260
Just fucking stop it because nobody 
believes you anymore.

3664
02:24:22,360 --> 02:24:23,193
We were talking about this earlier,
that Michael Shermer had an excellent 

3665
02:24:25,091 --> 02:24:25,924
article about that,
about Islam being the one religion that 

3666
02:24:28,511 --> 02:24:30,400
didn't go through the enlightenment.
Yes,

3667
02:24:30,420 --> 02:24:32,320
it's,
it's a very illuminating article.

3668
02:24:32,321 --> 02:24:37,321
It really shows you how sort of isolated
their ideology has remained and it's one

3669
02:24:39,311 --> 02:24:42,970
of the very few ideologies from that 
long ago.

3670
02:24:43,200 --> 02:24:45,490
It remains fairly untouched.

3671
02:24:45,890 --> 02:24:47,080
The reason that I think for that,
and it,

3672
02:24:47,110 --> 02:24:48,400
he may have touched on this in the 
article,

3673
02:24:49,210 --> 02:24:50,043
is there a structural differences 
between Islam and every other major 

3674
02:24:52,211 --> 02:24:53,044
world religion?
Right.

3675
02:24:53,170 --> 02:24:54,730
So if you take the,
the Quran,

3676
02:24:54,731 --> 02:24:56,460
the sooner and the headaches and you can
keep it together.

3677
02:24:56,470 --> 02:24:57,303
This is the,
this is,

3678
02:24:57,310 --> 02:24:58,143
you know,
Muslims will say this is the final 

3679
02:24:59,231 --> 02:25:01,330
perfect and unalterable would have got 
the Quran right.

3680
02:25:01,331 --> 02:25:05,050
And it's supported by the [inaudible] of
the sayings and doings of been molested.

3681
02:25:05,470 --> 02:25:06,303
Um,
no other religion makes a claim for 

3682
02:25:08,561 --> 02:25:10,630
itself.
They know that God will never come back.

3683
02:25:10,631 --> 02:25:11,464
In fact,
other religions make a specifically 

3684
02:25:12,281 --> 02:25:13,810
specifically opposite claim.
Uh,

3685
02:25:13,890 --> 02:25:14,723
and you know,
and no other religion I think apart 

3686
02:25:15,791 --> 02:25:16,624
from,
apart from Islam has proven itself so 

3687
02:25:18,491 --> 02:25:19,680
resistant to it.
You know,

3688
02:25:19,690 --> 02:25:21,230
to,
to maternity and,

3689
02:25:21,231 --> 02:25:24,010
and so in capable of adapting to modern 
circumstances,

3690
02:25:24,011 --> 02:25:24,844
Christianity for instance,
does a wonderful job of aligning itself 

3691
02:25:27,611 --> 02:25:30,280
with capitalist societies and adapting 
and changing with the times.

3692
02:25:30,290 --> 02:25:31,960
And,
and in my view,

3693
02:25:31,961 --> 02:25:32,794
maybe not entirely in yours,
but in my view certainly in the last 

3694
02:25:34,900 --> 02:25:35,733
hundred years has been nothing but 
nothing but a net positive for public 

3695
02:25:36,971 --> 02:25:39,310
life.
Now Islam of course,

3696
02:25:39,311 --> 02:25:40,144
you know,
it sort of locks down into the social 

3697
02:25:46,541 --> 02:25:49,720
attitudes that people had when Islam was
founded.

3698
02:25:49,780 --> 02:25:51,710
Yeah.
Christianity isn't Christina,

3699
02:25:51,720 --> 02:25:53,020
you know,
you've even got the Anglican church,

3700
02:25:53,021 --> 02:25:54,160
you know,
now women bishops,

3701
02:25:54,161 --> 02:25:55,510
gay marriage is probably whatever,
you know,

3702
02:25:55,790 --> 02:25:58,750
there's the Christianity is adapting to 
this stuff and is changing,

3703
02:25:59,140 --> 02:26:00,250
but you know,
it's not,

3704
02:26:00,251 --> 02:26:01,240
Islam has some problems.
I mean,

3705
02:26:01,241 --> 02:26:03,400
another structural problem of course 
with it is that even,

3706
02:26:03,430 --> 02:26:04,263
even Islam zone scholars say that where 
the Quran contradicts itself is of 

3707
02:26:08,051 --> 02:26:08,884
course it does in many places because 
parts of it is just sort of plagiarized 

3708
02:26:10,961 --> 02:26:12,580
old testament and the rest of it is just
mad.

3709
02:26:12,990 --> 02:26:14,710
Um,
where,

3710
02:26:15,220 --> 02:26:18,550
where it contradicts itself as a 
principle of abrogation which means that

3711
02:26:18,710 --> 02:26:21,940
reverses versus that will reveal to 
Mohammed later,

3712
02:26:22,090 --> 02:26:25,570
chronologically in time a supersede the 
earlier ones.

3713
02:26:25,570 --> 02:26:26,950
Well the problem is at the earlier ones 
that the peace,

3714
02:26:26,951 --> 02:26:27,784
love and understanding ones and later 
ones when he was a warlord of the ones 

3715
02:26:29,741 --> 02:26:30,340
that kill,
kill,

3716
02:26:30,340 --> 02:26:31,173
kill the infidel versus all right.
So according to Islam zone scholars and 

3717
02:26:33,641 --> 02:26:35,500
they don't think there's any real 
disagreement on this.

3718
02:26:35,950 --> 02:26:39,910
The belly coast verses in the Quran take
precedence over the peace,

3719
02:26:39,911 --> 02:26:42,550
love and understanding versus,
and of course you know,

3720
02:26:42,551 --> 02:26:45,460
the other structural problems with 
religion that prevent it from it,

3721
02:26:45,461 --> 02:26:46,294
from engaging with maternity and 
intellectual inquiry inequality for 

3722
02:26:48,071 --> 02:26:48,610
women and gays.
Will,

3723
02:26:48,610 --> 02:26:49,443
the rest of it have led to things like,
and people have heard me say this 

3724
02:26:51,911 --> 02:26:52,990
before,
but I think it's an interesting,

3725
02:26:52,991 --> 02:26:53,824
just to just one little data point.
There isn't a single world class 

3726
02:26:55,481 --> 02:26:57,130
university anywhere in the Islamic 
world.

3727
02:26:57,250 --> 02:26:58,083
Not One.
Why I think you can fill in the gaps 

3728
02:26:59,951 --> 02:27:01,150
yourself,
but you know,

3729
02:27:01,151 --> 02:27:03,070
to,
to claim that that is somehow equivalent

3730
02:27:03,071 --> 02:27:03,791
as a,
as you know,

3731
02:27:03,791 --> 02:27:04,780
as we say to these,
to this,

3732
02:27:04,781 --> 02:27:06,920
you know,
to memories pizza is,

3733
02:27:06,921 --> 02:27:07,754
is insane.

3734
02:27:07,780 --> 02:27:09,550
It's completely absurd.
And for the government to,

3735
02:27:09,551 --> 02:27:10,061
you know,
to,

3736
02:27:10,061 --> 02:27:14,260
to deny gay people the right to educate 
themselves and you know,

3737
02:27:14,261 --> 02:27:15,094
and deny gay people knowledge,
they need to protect themselves about 

3738
02:27:17,141 --> 02:27:17,974
threats at home.
And it is now dangerous to be a gay 

3739
02:27:19,511 --> 02:27:20,980
person in America.
Why?

3740
02:27:21,100 --> 02:27:23,320
It's not fucking memories pizza,
it's Muslims,

3741
02:27:23,640 --> 02:27:24,473
uh,
to deny people the ability to educate 

3742
02:27:25,721 --> 02:27:28,300
themselves on that is unacceptable and 
unconscionable.

3743
02:27:28,301 --> 02:27:32,290
An unforgivable.
And so I'm doing two things.

3744
02:27:32,291 --> 02:27:33,124
One of them is we're going to do the 
shoot back party at the Republican 

3745
02:27:34,990 --> 02:27:35,830
National Convention,
which I'm going to show up to,

3746
02:27:35,831 --> 02:27:37,150
which you know,
which is just get,

3747
02:27:37,151 --> 02:27:38,360
you know,
on the gays.

3748
02:27:38,410 --> 02:27:41,170
Uh,
and the other is back policy.

3749
02:27:41,200 --> 02:27:42,300
The policy.
This is the [inaudible].

3750
02:27:42,430 --> 02:27:43,930
There's little party,
the Republican National Convention,

3751
02:27:43,931 --> 02:27:44,380
just,
you know,

3752
02:27:44,380 --> 02:27:45,213
reminding gay people that the best way 
they can protect themselves is not 

3753
02:27:46,810 --> 02:27:47,643
pander to,
is not the NRA going to open its doors 

3754
02:27:49,781 --> 02:27:50,614
to gay people.

3755
02:27:50,830 --> 02:27:53,860
I don't see any reason why the NRA is 
not already.

3756
02:27:53,910 --> 02:27:56,080
Um,
just take them all in all then yeah.

3757
02:27:56,270 --> 02:27:59,030
Might be a good thing at this point.
Hillary is losing a,

3758
02:27:59,031 --> 02:28:01,180
I don't think the NRA is worrying,
worrying about membership.

3759
02:28:01,181 --> 02:28:03,670
I think their membership grows every 
time as well as catastrophes,

3760
02:28:03,671 --> 02:28:05,110
because every time,
every time,

3761
02:28:05,111 --> 02:28:05,780
you know,
there's a,

3762
02:28:05,780 --> 02:28:07,300
there's some other,
I mean,

3763
02:28:07,301 --> 02:28:08,320
I don't know,
but I'm guessing,

3764
02:28:08,570 --> 02:28:09,403
I mean,
I think the energy at the NRA is 

3765
02:28:10,151 --> 02:28:12,730
probably quite healthy,
quite healthy and membership growth.

3766
02:28:12,760 --> 02:28:13,593
It's quite healthy.
But really the people who benefit are 

3767
02:28:14,861 --> 02:28:16,870
the arms manufacturers.
Good,

3768
02:28:17,590 --> 02:28:20,380
good.
I want lots of market competition in the

3769
02:28:20,381 --> 02:28:22,130
arms trade.
I want cheap,

3770
02:28:22,430 --> 02:28:25,310
reliable firearm.
So every home has got 12 of them.

3771
02:28:25,370 --> 02:28:26,270
Good.
Your country,

3772
02:28:26,271 --> 02:28:28,070
you're not even allowed to have them.
No.

3773
02:28:28,090 --> 02:28:28,923
No.
I'm not allowed a pistol in my own 

3774
02:28:29,541 --> 02:28:30,590
country to protect myself.

3775
02:28:30,590 --> 02:28:32,400
Despite the fact that government is 
letting you know,

3776
02:28:32,420 --> 02:28:34,460
hundreds of thousands of people who want
me dead.

3777
02:28:34,760 --> 02:28:37,610
And this is not just me being a crazy 
right wing lunatic.

3778
02:28:37,790 --> 02:28:38,630
Um,
although Ammo,

3779
02:28:38,640 --> 02:28:39,890
all of those things,
it is,

3780
02:28:40,060 --> 02:28:40,893
this is,
this is a Gallup poll a couple of years 

3781
02:28:43,130 --> 02:28:45,080
ago polled 1,001
British Muslims,

3782
02:28:45,110 --> 02:28:47,780
100% of them said to homosexuality was,
you know,

3783
02:28:47,781 --> 02:28:50,170
it was unacceptable.
And then a later of percent,

3784
02:28:50,210 --> 02:28:52,670
hundred percent that's higher than 
Palestine.

3785
02:28:52,671 --> 02:28:53,504
When 96% of people in the pew global 
data say that homosexuality is 

3786
02:28:56,961 --> 02:29:01,670
unacceptable,
100% and 52% of those people weren't gay

3787
02:29:01,671 --> 02:29:03,950
sex made illegal.
This is not crazy.

3788
02:29:03,951 --> 02:29:04,784
Muslims in Racker,
this is people two streets away from 

3789
02:29:06,351 --> 02:29:09,080
where I live or even one street away or 
even in the same building.

3790
02:29:09,081 --> 02:29:11,840
I don't fucking know.
They all think I'm unacceptable.

3791
02:29:11,870 --> 02:29:16,640
I don't want this in the west.
Get rid of it and lack of mode.

3792
02:29:17,720 --> 02:29:18,553
No,
I'm not going to go out and I'm not 

3793
02:29:18,891 --> 02:29:19,724
going to go out.

3794
02:29:19,790 --> 02:29:21,970
I'm not going to go out and shoot them.
But somebody in a fucking like,

3795
02:29:21,980 --> 02:29:23,750
you know,
somebody comes dressed in,

3796
02:29:23,780 --> 02:29:24,613
you know,
flowing white white clothes with a beer 

3797
02:29:26,121 --> 02:29:28,010
called Mohammed knocks at my front door.
It looks aggressive.

3798
02:29:28,040 --> 02:29:29,900
I'm putting my hand on my,
on my hip,

3799
02:29:29,901 --> 02:29:31,970
you know,
and making sure that I'm not in danger.

3800
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:32,900
Yeah.
Damn right.

3801
02:29:32,901 --> 02:29:34,100
I am.
And,

3802
02:29:34,130 --> 02:29:35,850
but you can't do that in your country.
Well,

3803
02:29:36,040 --> 02:29:36,551
why do you think,
I mean,

3804
02:29:36,551 --> 02:29:37,580
is that where you're going to come over 
here?

3805
02:29:38,070 --> 02:29:39,480
Can you move here?
Um,

3806
02:29:39,770 --> 02:29:42,020
well,
I see you seem to fit the profile.

3807
02:29:43,130 --> 02:29:45,720
You make good money.
You're expected.

3808
02:29:45,740 --> 02:29:49,520
You have a great job in a Republican.
I don't complication,

3809
02:29:49,550 --> 02:29:51,450
I don't think I'd have a problem getting
a events.

3810
02:29:51,620 --> 02:29:52,830
So pretty easy,
right.

3811
02:29:52,840 --> 02:29:54,080
But a green card,
um,

3812
02:29:54,200 --> 02:29:56,960
just learn a bunch of goofy shit about 
our country that we don't remember.

3813
02:29:57,200 --> 02:29:58,033
I'll have to get married first.
I've talked to some people that have 

3814
02:29:59,361 --> 02:30:00,194
learned a,
become Canadians that have come over 

3815
02:30:00,891 --> 02:30:03,740
here and gotten their green cards and 
they know a lot more about this is,

3816
02:30:04,160 --> 02:30:04,993
this is the best country in the world.
And it would give me nothing but 

3817
02:30:07,521 --> 02:30:09,970
pleasure to see what I'm saying.

3818
02:30:13,070 --> 02:30:15,400
Nothing but pleasure to,
uh,

3819
02:30:15,450 --> 02:30:16,370
to,
to come and live here.

3820
02:30:16,371 --> 02:30:16,941
So we'll see.
I'll,

3821
02:30:16,941 --> 02:30:18,320
I'll keep you posted on that.
Yeah,

3822
02:30:18,450 --> 02:30:19,410
some do.
But you know,

3823
02:30:19,430 --> 02:30:19,791
this,
this,

3824
02:30:19,791 --> 02:30:20,624
this,
if the left is not going to be honest 

3825
02:30:22,280 --> 02:30:23,960
about,
um,

3826
02:30:25,040 --> 02:30:27,040
the risks to gaze,
we've got to educate ourselves.

3827
02:30:27,041 --> 02:30:29,450
Stop listening to dumb as pictured 
celebrities.

3828
02:30:29,451 --> 02:30:30,284
Stop listening to politicize reporters,
stopped listening to the governments 

3829
02:30:32,031 --> 02:30:34,790
that listen to Obama and Hillary.
Like trump,

3830
02:30:34,791 --> 02:30:35,624
by the way,
is the only his speech after Orlando 

3831
02:30:37,430 --> 02:30:39,890
magnificent,
most pro.

3832
02:30:40,040 --> 02:30:40,731
Well,
he's just saying,

3833
02:30:40,731 --> 02:30:41,270
look,
this is,

3834
02:30:41,270 --> 02:30:44,090
this is a problem for the gay community.
We cannot allow this stuff to come in.

3835
02:30:44,091 --> 02:30:45,460
I'm going to protect you.
I mean,

3836
02:30:45,470 --> 02:30:45,951
you know,
you need to,

3837
02:30:45,951 --> 02:30:47,010
you need to arm yourself and you say,
oh,

3838
02:30:47,040 --> 02:30:47,271
blah,
blah,

3839
02:30:47,271 --> 02:30:48,650
blah.
You need to read a speech.

3840
02:30:48,651 --> 02:30:50,420
Cause it's a lot more complex and 
nuanced than that.

3841
02:30:50,720 --> 02:30:53,870
Then that suggests genuinely great 
speech,

3842
02:30:54,140 --> 02:30:56,270
which suggests to me that Obama might be
kind of like a,

3843
02:30:56,271 --> 02:30:58,370
almost like a Cameroonian politician.
Not,

3844
02:30:58,371 --> 02:30:59,001
sorry,
not the country,

3845
02:30:59,001 --> 02:31:00,770
but I mean like David Cameron.
Uh,

3846
02:31:01,400 --> 02:31:02,540
um,
in the,

3847
02:31:02,541 --> 02:31:03,351
in the sense that,
you know,

3848
02:31:03,351 --> 02:31:04,070
he can,
he can,

3849
02:31:04,070 --> 02:31:06,890
he can sort of falter now and again,
but when the moment calls for it,

3850
02:31:06,920 --> 02:31:08,120
you know,
he rises to the occasion.

3851
02:31:08,180 --> 02:31:09,470
A Bush was like that,
you know,

3852
02:31:09,471 --> 02:31:10,304
the,
uh,

3853
02:31:10,390 --> 02:31:12,680
w speech after nine 11 was pretty 
spectacular.

3854
02:31:13,130 --> 02:31:14,000
Uh,
so,

3855
02:31:14,001 --> 02:31:14,481
you know,
trump,

3856
02:31:14,481 --> 02:31:15,740
trump has very,
very strong,

3857
02:31:15,741 --> 02:31:16,574
I mean,
I think trumps the most pro gay 

3858
02:31:17,001 --> 02:31:19,740
candidate in American electoral history 
on either side of the divide,

3859
02:31:19,741 --> 02:31:20,970
frankly.
I really do.

3860
02:31:21,210 --> 02:31:22,910
But anyway,
we gave,

3861
02:31:22,920 --> 02:31:24,330
people need to take this into their own 
hands,

3862
02:31:24,390 --> 02:31:25,950
frankly.
And,

3863
02:31:25,970 --> 02:31:26,803
uh,
so I'm going to Sweden where a year ago 

3864
02:31:30,390 --> 02:31:32,270
the Swedish authorities say,
uh,

3865
02:31:32,340 --> 02:31:33,173
told a gay pride march that it was 
needlessly provocative for walking 

3866
02:31:35,881 --> 02:31:37,170
through a Muslim area of Stockholm.

3867
02:31:37,650 --> 02:31:38,550
Now that's,
that's,

3868
02:31:38,940 --> 02:31:40,470
I mean,
really needlessly,

3869
02:31:40,480 --> 02:31:42,720
needlessly provocative.
This is gay pride,

3870
02:31:42,820 --> 02:31:44,850
how much gay stuff goes on in the Muslim
world,

3871
02:31:44,851 --> 02:31:47,440
because isn't that a big issue as well?
Right,

3872
02:31:47,960 --> 02:31:49,980
because of the suppression.
Yeah.

3873
02:31:50,070 --> 02:31:51,330
Anyways,
so yeah,

3874
02:31:51,331 --> 02:31:52,890
we should get onto that because that's 
interesting.

3875
02:31:53,070 --> 02:31:54,210
So I'm gonna,
I'm gonna,

3876
02:31:54,360 --> 02:31:55,193
I'm gonna ride.
I hope that my security guys are golden 

3877
02:31:58,531 --> 02:31:59,640
pony.
Please say yes.

3878
02:31:59,880 --> 02:32:01,110
I'm going to ride a horse.
Yes,

3879
02:32:01,230 --> 02:32:03,810
you are into the Muslim ride a horse.
I'm hoping so.

3880
02:32:03,811 --> 02:32:04,590
Yeah.
Uh,

3881
02:32:04,590 --> 02:32:05,423
the security people asking me not to do 
it because they can't protect me if I'm 

3882
02:32:07,590 --> 02:32:08,670
much higher.
Right.

3883
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:10,320
Because anybody could take me out from 
anywhere,

3884
02:32:10,321 --> 02:32:12,540
but I'm,
I'm hoping to persuade them to let me do

3885
02:32:12,541 --> 02:32:13,374
it and I want to ride in with like,
I want 20 people in a v shape with like 

3886
02:32:15,271 --> 02:32:18,180
Milo banners behind me,
like proper full game of thrones style.

3887
02:32:18,480 --> 02:32:20,940
I want to be able to write this or 
they're going to be of course,

3888
02:32:21,570 --> 02:32:23,310
which we'll take it,
we'll take all our people over.

3889
02:32:23,311 --> 02:32:24,610
We'll have,
I'm sure there'd be plenty of volunteers

3890
02:32:24,611 --> 02:32:25,444
and this March anyway,
and it's going to be me on horseback 

3891
02:32:28,290 --> 02:32:29,123
marching into the Muslim ghetto and then
giving a speech about Islam and gays in 

3892
02:32:32,191 --> 02:32:36,060
the very hot of European cookery,
this country,

3893
02:32:36,061 --> 02:32:36,894
Sweden,
which has given itself over completely 

3894
02:32:38,821 --> 02:32:41,730
to Islamic immigration,
which is now the rape capital of Europe.

3895
02:32:41,760 --> 02:32:43,140
Because the true,
yes,

3896
02:32:43,350 --> 02:32:44,183
the Rape Camp Malmo Malmo in Sweden is 
now the rape capital of Europe because 

3897
02:32:47,941 --> 02:32:48,774
of uncontrolled Muslim immigration.
And the police there have been 

3898
02:32:50,611 --> 02:32:53,610
instructed not to record the ethnicity 
or religion of a silent,

3899
02:32:53,611 --> 02:32:54,444
so they don't even ask to Yup.
They don't even have statistics on who 

3900
02:32:56,911 --> 02:32:59,730
does it any more similar to the Loretta 
Lynch Trent redacted transcript.

3901
02:32:59,731 --> 02:33:01,530
This is what people don't see color.

3902
02:33:01,800 --> 02:33:03,480
I just see people.
Exactly.

3903
02:33:03,481 --> 02:33:05,610
And men are rapists.
Cause this is what the left does.

3904
02:33:05,611 --> 02:33:06,444
It's like you import a load of Muslims,
Muslims start raping and stealing from 

3905
02:33:09,301 --> 02:33:12,810
everybody and the responses.
This is toxic masculinity.

3906
02:33:13,040 --> 02:33:14,100
Hmm.
That's a,

3907
02:33:14,101 --> 02:33:16,680
that's a hilarious,
I love that term.

3908
02:33:16,740 --> 02:33:19,500
Anyway,
what are we going to do about that?

3909
02:33:19,650 --> 02:33:22,170
What is swollen plan to do to try to 
mitigate some of the rape?

3910
02:33:22,380 --> 02:33:23,400
Oh,
do you know what they've done?

3911
02:33:23,760 --> 02:33:24,593
You know,
don't you know,

3912
02:33:24,840 --> 02:33:26,520
you gave me a cue question.
Surely you did.

3913
02:33:27,260 --> 02:33:28,800
That was,
I thought that was a,

3914
02:33:28,801 --> 02:33:30,830
I thought that was a canny.
Kenny.

3915
02:33:30,840 --> 02:33:31,680
Uh,
uh,

3916
02:33:31,830 --> 02:33:32,970
what do you call it?
T up?

3917
02:33:33,360 --> 02:33:34,680
Yeah.
Well,

3918
02:33:34,681 --> 02:33:38,820
Sweden has issued women with wristbands 
and these wristbands say don't rape.

3919
02:33:39,630 --> 02:33:41,370
That's Sweden's answer to the rape 
crisis.

3920
02:33:43,610 --> 02:33:44,443
Yes.
Sweden's to the rape crisis is an issue 

3921
02:33:47,060 --> 02:33:47,893
with wristbands that say don't rape.
And to forbid the police for mentioning 

3922
02:33:51,151 --> 02:33:54,390
the ethnicity and religion of a silence 
that Sweden's answer the rape crisis,

3923
02:33:55,320 --> 02:33:58,980
I can't fix that,
but Milo's answer to the rape crisis and

3924
02:33:58,981 --> 02:34:01,380
deport all the Muslims,
deport them,

3925
02:34:01,440 --> 02:34:02,273
get rid of them.
Has anybody else suggested that anyone 

3926
02:34:04,691 --> 02:34:07,140
in their countries or any debate about 
how to handle this?

3927
02:34:07,160 --> 02:34:08,310
No.
What are they doing?

3928
02:34:08,311 --> 02:34:09,450
They're just sticking their head in the 
sand.

3929
02:34:09,480 --> 02:34:11,250
Yeah.
Wow.

3930
02:34:11,430 --> 02:34:12,263
So I'm going to,
I cannot fix the woman problem single 

3931
02:34:13,610 --> 02:34:14,443
handed,
but I can perhaps embarrass the 

3932
02:34:15,541 --> 02:34:18,430
government about the gay problem.
And I certainly hope to do that.

3933
02:34:18,431 --> 02:34:19,264
So end of the month,
if you have enjoyed any of my 

3934
02:34:21,700 --> 02:34:23,920
programming or writing or anything,
uh,

3935
02:34:23,921 --> 02:34:27,850
enjoy the next three weeks because after
the 27th of July,

3936
02:34:27,970 --> 02:34:28,803
that could be it.

3937
02:34:29,830 --> 02:34:31,300
Whew.
That's a ballsy move,

3938
02:34:31,301 --> 02:34:33,490
man.
To go to one of the most,

3939
02:34:33,491 --> 02:34:36,820
probably I will say do it.
Don't do it.

3940
02:34:36,880 --> 02:34:37,713
One of the most troubled areas and 
Sweden and to walk through these 

3941
02:34:42,971 --> 02:34:44,060
neighborhoods with,
no,

3942
02:34:44,200 --> 02:34:46,210
these are obviously immigrant 
neighborhoods,

3943
02:34:46,211 --> 02:34:48,250
right?
These are people that are Muslim cancer.

3944
02:34:48,251 --> 02:34:49,084
It's exclusively.
When did these people move into this 

3945
02:34:51,011 --> 02:34:52,570
area?
When did this start taking place?

3946
02:34:52,590 --> 02:34:54,400
I think over the last 10,
10 years,

3947
02:34:54,520 --> 02:34:55,400
Sweden's been,
ha ha,

3948
02:34:55,610 --> 02:34:56,443
you know,
has taken in hundreds of thousands of 

3949
02:34:57,551 --> 02:35:00,190
them a year for the last 10 years I 
think.

3950
02:35:00,370 --> 02:35:02,230
And that doesn't sound like a lot to an 
American,

3951
02:35:02,231 --> 02:35:04,060
but Sweden doesn't have many people in 
it.

3952
02:35:04,120 --> 02:35:04,953
Like Sweden is not very populous.
There are a couple of towns and that's 

3953
02:35:07,571 --> 02:35:12,010
really the overall population of Sweden.
A couple of million,

3954
02:35:12,011 --> 02:35:12,844
I guess.
I'm guessing like 4 million or 

3955
02:35:14,171 --> 02:35:15,130
something.
I think you're right.

3956
02:35:15,131 --> 02:35:16,180
I think it might be less than that.

3957
02:35:16,180 --> 02:35:17,013
And I,
I think it's a fairly small geographic 

3958
02:35:18,971 --> 02:35:20,710
area too.
So they're on top of each.

3959
02:35:20,711 --> 02:35:21,544
Well does it,
I think this is a big stretch of it up 

3960
02:35:22,391 --> 02:35:24,760
north where basically nobody lives,
it's just like snow or something.

3961
02:35:24,880 --> 02:35:27,960
And then down there's like three or four
cities and yeah,

3962
02:35:27,961 --> 02:35:28,280
I mean,
so,

3963
02:35:28,280 --> 02:35:29,860
so two,
300,000

3964
02:35:29,861 --> 02:35:32,290
people a year is not to nothing.
I've been to Stockholm.

3965
02:35:32,291 --> 02:35:33,490
It's gorgeous.
Beautiful.

3966
02:35:33,520 --> 02:35:36,250
But it won't be for long.
It will be Al stock home soon.

3967
02:35:36,610 --> 02:35:39,780
Oh boy.
I'll stock alice.

3968
02:35:39,930 --> 02:35:40,763
So the only thing is you used to hear 
Abba and give it a couple of years and 

3969
02:35:44,381 --> 02:35:45,214
all he will hear is,

3970
02:35:45,240 --> 02:35:46,170
oh Whoa,

3971
02:35:47,130 --> 02:35:48,410
what would they,
a Stockholm,

3972
02:35:48,510 --> 02:35:50,940
what would the uh,
numbers for mass shootings.

3973
02:35:51,140 --> 02:35:53,430
So that was,
was did you,

3974
02:35:53,431 --> 02:35:54,264
uh,
it's the definition of what someone is 

3975
02:35:56,961 --> 02:35:59,810
using for what a mass shooting is very 
varied.

3976
02:35:59,840 --> 02:36:02,000
So it's like,
it's in one place if it's,

3977
02:36:02,510 --> 02:36:05,550
which is where the questions are coming 
in and uh,

3978
02:36:06,050 --> 02:36:07,720
they also don't count them if it's maybe
a,

3979
02:36:07,721 --> 02:36:09,800
a military.
Right.

3980
02:36:09,830 --> 02:36:11,540
What are the other options are,
what are the other,

3981
02:36:11,541 --> 02:36:13,540
uh,
candidates for the number one,

3982
02:36:14,590 --> 02:36:16,900
this a massacre.
A couple of massacres.

3983
02:36:16,930 --> 02:36:18,580
Wounded knee massacre,
right?

3984
02:36:18,600 --> 02:36:20,230
The Saint Louis massacre.
Yeah.

3985
02:36:20,231 --> 02:36:21,570
Those are the two ways,
right?

3986
02:36:22,070 --> 02:36:22,721
Yeah.
Yeah.

3987
02:36:22,721 --> 02:36:25,420
The Saint Louis one in the a wounded 
knee one were to,

3988
02:36:25,421 --> 02:36:27,670
I remembered other names of people 
there,

3989
02:36:27,671 --> 02:36:28,504
right?
Yep.

3990
02:36:28,710 --> 02:36:30,280
Oh,
okay.

3991
02:36:30,470 --> 02:36:31,810
Yeah.
Well it depends on our definition,

3992
02:36:31,811 --> 02:36:32,730
but any,
in many cases,

3993
02:36:33,040 --> 02:36:34,640
horrible tragedy.
Right.

3994
02:36:34,840 --> 02:36:35,673
So I don't understand how sweet and 
thinks that they're just going to calm 

3995
02:36:38,741 --> 02:36:39,574
the situation down by not mentioning the
gender or the name of the assailant or 

3996
02:36:44,230 --> 02:36:45,580
basically just can't say it was Muslims.

3997
02:36:45,580 --> 02:36:46,430
It did it.
Uh,

3998
02:36:46,450 --> 02:36:49,480
I bet everybody is.
What it does is it means they are now no

3999
02:36:49,481 --> 02:36:50,314
national statistics on this.
So nobody can say 97% of the rapes are 

4000
02:36:53,891 --> 02:36:55,480
committed by this portion of the 
population.

4001
02:36:55,840 --> 02:36:58,900
Fix this.
The government's answer is not fixed the

4002
02:36:58,901 --> 02:37:01,150
problem,
but obscure the data.

4003
02:37:01,420 --> 02:37:02,830
They're going to ruin their whole 
country.

4004
02:37:02,920 --> 02:37:04,320
They already have.
That was joe.

4005
02:37:04,360 --> 02:37:05,560
Yeah.
Malmo.

4006
02:37:06,130 --> 02:37:07,900
This was a feminist.
Progressive Paradise.

4007
02:37:08,050 --> 02:37:08,883
Sweden was like a left wing paradise.
Sweden was one of the few countries 

4008
02:37:10,691 --> 02:37:12,640
where leftwing politics worked.
You know,

4009
02:37:12,700 --> 02:37:14,890
they,
they as taxes for everything in Sweden.

4010
02:37:14,891 --> 02:37:15,471
Like if you,
and this is,

4011
02:37:15,471 --> 02:37:16,304
I swear this is true because I have a 
Swedish friends told me that the TAC 

4012
02:37:18,261 --> 02:37:21,560
like property taxes in Sweden depend on 
like how nice your view is,

4013
02:37:21,561 --> 02:37:22,940
you know.
So if you have a nice ocean view,

4014
02:37:23,060 --> 02:37:25,250
they will charge you more like local 
council tax.

4015
02:37:25,250 --> 02:37:27,860
I know what you call it in America.
Did you like the property tax?

4016
02:37:27,950 --> 02:37:28,783
Is that property tax?
The tax you pay to the city to like to 

4017
02:37:30,531 --> 02:37:32,060
do the roads and stuff?
Well yeah,

4018
02:37:32,061 --> 02:37:34,430
there's,
there's property tax that you have.

4019
02:37:34,690 --> 02:37:36,770
There's,
we have a lot of taxes over here anyway.

4020
02:37:36,771 --> 02:37:38,600
So one of these taxes,
like if you have a nicer view,

4021
02:37:38,690 --> 02:37:40,660
they literally have so little to do in 
Sweden.

4022
02:37:40,730 --> 02:37:41,563
The government is just sitting around 
dreaming up new taxes for things and 

4023
02:37:43,341 --> 02:37:45,200
working out how they can charge people 
more money for things.

4024
02:37:45,201 --> 02:37:46,820
But it was,
you know,

4025
02:37:46,840 --> 02:37:49,070
that's how I feel.
Appraisal fairly effective.

4026
02:37:49,071 --> 02:37:50,480
I mean the country was nice place,
you know,

4027
02:37:50,540 --> 02:37:51,373
what was the thought process between 
letting all those people in there and 

4028
02:37:53,001 --> 02:37:53,834
just open minded and just crazy left 
wing lunatics who refuse to accept 

4029
02:37:59,001 --> 02:37:59,834
reality?
They think they think that language 

4030
02:38:00,921 --> 02:38:01,550
shapes reality.

4031
02:38:01,550 --> 02:38:02,900
They think if they call,
you know,

4032
02:38:02,901 --> 02:38:03,734
if they think if they,
if they say lies often enough that it 

4033
02:38:05,601 --> 02:38:06,740
becomes the truth,
you know,

4034
02:38:06,741 --> 02:38:08,390
which of course in some cases it's true,
but,

4035
02:38:08,750 --> 02:38:09,171
uh,
you know,

4036
02:38:09,171 --> 02:38:10,004
if you say,
if you say Muslims are peaceful often 

4037
02:38:10,551 --> 02:38:11,690
enough,
it does not seem to come through.

4038
02:38:12,020 --> 02:38:12,950
Uh,
there was,

4039
02:38:12,951 --> 02:38:14,110
there are limits.
There are limits to this,

4040
02:38:14,111 --> 02:38:15,470
uh,
to the power of positive thinking.

4041
02:38:15,530 --> 02:38:18,460
Is there anybody that thinks it's a good
thing to have those people there?

4042
02:38:18,461 --> 02:38:19,600
Are there,
are there any arguments?

4043
02:38:19,870 --> 02:38:24,870
This is a positive sort of multicultural
benefit to Sweden to think so.

4044
02:38:25,610 --> 02:38:27,620
I think Swedish people get it now,
but it doesn't,

4045
02:38:27,621 --> 02:38:29,510
I haven't seen any signs.
Yeah.

4046
02:38:29,511 --> 02:38:31,670
But only now.
I haven't seen any signs that the,

4047
02:38:31,671 --> 02:38:33,140
um,
that the government gets it.

4048
02:38:33,470 --> 02:38:34,930
And indeed in Sweden of course,
you know,

4049
02:38:34,931 --> 02:38:37,820
it's very heavily socially enforced 
consensus.

4050
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:40,730
If you even mentioned immigration called
a racist and Sweden and you know,

4051
02:38:40,731 --> 02:38:42,950
there's no discussion of the papers 
until very,

4052
02:38:42,951 --> 02:38:44,250
very recently.
Um,

4053
02:38:44,360 --> 02:38:46,760
it's not on TV.
People just don't.

4054
02:38:46,790 --> 02:38:49,820
So it asks about it bill out over the 
top before people start calling it.

4055
02:38:49,821 --> 02:38:50,654
Exactly.
Basically everyone needs to have a 

4056
02:38:52,041 --> 02:38:54,980
daughter or a friend's daughter who was 
raped before anything will happen.

4057
02:38:55,040 --> 02:38:56,860
Choose Christ.
Yeah.

4058
02:38:57,870 --> 02:39:00,950
Oh well,
so queasy Sweden.

4059
02:39:00,951 --> 02:39:02,480
Yes,
and then here's the big picture.

4060
02:39:02,481 --> 02:39:03,314
How do you take these people from these 
places where they're coming over here 

4061
02:39:05,331 --> 02:39:07,640
and doing these horrible things?
How do you educate them?

4062
02:39:07,641 --> 02:39:08,474
How do you change that?
How do you don't want to just share 

4063
02:39:09,610 --> 02:39:11,060
them?
I want the how does anybody ever,

4064
02:39:11,061 --> 02:39:12,740
I mean,
if you're going to engineer humanity,

4065
02:39:13,970 --> 02:39:14,803
humanity,
I care about keeping my family safe and 

4066
02:39:16,161 --> 02:39:16,994
keeping my culture in tact and I want 
them deported or I care about those 

4067
02:39:19,911 --> 02:39:23,330
things as well,
but I also think that as a civilization,

4068
02:39:23,510 --> 02:39:27,440
we should look towards optimizing the 
rest of the civilization.

4069
02:39:28,340 --> 02:39:30,200
You should.
You should invade their country's killed

4070
02:39:30,201 --> 02:39:32,810
our leaders and convert to Christianity.
As Ann Coulter said,

4071
02:39:35,870 --> 02:39:38,870
Oh God,
do you have a better solution?

4072
02:39:39,050 --> 02:39:40,640
That's suppression.
That's not going to work.

4073
02:39:40,641 --> 02:39:43,910
They're going to secretly build up.
They're going to make a dirty bomb.

4074
02:39:43,980 --> 02:39:48,350
Does come in.
Iraq has been neutralized as a threat to

4075
02:39:48,351 --> 02:39:50,660
the world.
It's a fucking mess either fighting over

4076
02:39:50,661 --> 02:39:51,520
each other,
the shows,

4077
02:39:52,250 --> 02:39:53,083
they're not coming for us anytime soon.
The move wars everywhere to us anytime 

4078
02:39:56,661 --> 02:39:58,640
soon.
Iraq has been neutralized as a threat.

4079
02:39:58,880 --> 02:40:00,410
That worked out pretty great from where 
I'm sitting.

4080
02:40:00,411 --> 02:40:03,170
Well were weren't they like a fake 
threat in the first place?

4081
02:40:03,171 --> 02:40:08,171
I mean the only reason why the it back 
cause we armed him and supported him.

4082
02:40:09,020 --> 02:40:09,853
I in general think that America is one 
of the reasons America is cool is that 

4083
02:40:15,381 --> 02:40:16,214
it is the only country.
If you're sitting from outside America 

4084
02:40:17,451 --> 02:40:19,110
is the only country that's got your 
back,

4085
02:40:19,140 --> 02:40:20,940
is the only country that will go and 
help other people out.

4086
02:40:20,970 --> 02:40:22,980
You know,
out of sweet like fucking things up.

4087
02:40:23,230 --> 02:40:24,090
Yeah,
it's pretty cool.

4088
02:40:24,130 --> 02:40:25,650
That's,
I mean that's how I ended the day.

4089
02:40:26,310 --> 02:40:29,250
There's something,
there's something to be said for that to

4090
02:40:29,251 --> 02:40:31,740
every like every country in the world 
likes to rag on America,

4091
02:40:31,741 --> 02:40:33,240
but where do they come when they need 
help?

4092
02:40:33,270 --> 02:40:35,250
They come to America because they want 
the boys,

4093
02:40:35,251 --> 02:40:35,701
you know,
they want,

4094
02:40:35,701 --> 02:40:37,260
they want your boys to make it rain,

4095
02:40:37,440 --> 02:40:38,273
right?
That massive amount of military moment 

4096
02:40:40,810 --> 02:40:45,580
momentum and that military momentum,
like it supports a lot of people in this

4097
02:40:45,581 --> 02:40:48,850
country and it just supports a lot of 
arms manufacturers,

4098
02:40:48,851 --> 02:40:49,684
a lot of,
there's a lot of industry involved in 

4099
02:40:51,791 --> 02:40:52,624
the military and so we spread out and 
the way to keep that military mode 

4100
02:40:56,410 --> 02:40:57,243
moving and the way to keep it 
operational is you have to have it all 

4101
02:40:59,471 --> 02:41:00,304
over the world.
So we're in every fucking corner of the 

4102
02:41:02,651 --> 02:41:03,370
world.

4103
02:41:03,370 --> 02:41:05,200
Well,
I'm glad to America is,

4104
02:41:05,201 --> 02:41:06,034
you know,
one of the things I want people to 

4105
02:41:06,611 --> 02:41:07,444
remember in this election and remember 
just generally in life is America's 

4106
02:41:10,331 --> 02:41:13,390
fucking great.
America is wonderful,

4107
02:41:13,540 --> 02:41:14,890
you know,
it's not perfect.

4108
02:41:14,950 --> 02:41:16,990
There are all sorts of things that 
everybody would like to change about it.

4109
02:41:16,991 --> 02:41:19,230
And the business of improving on America
is,

4110
02:41:19,231 --> 02:41:22,180
is what politics is for.
But America is pretty fucking great.

4111
02:41:22,450 --> 02:41:24,580
And speaking of somebody who is not an 
American,

4112
02:41:24,910 --> 02:41:28,840
I am so happy.
I'm so glad that America does have,

4113
02:41:28,841 --> 02:41:30,730
you know,
like a finger everywhere in the world.

4114
02:41:30,970 --> 02:41:33,670
It makes us safer.
It makes us more secure.

4115
02:41:33,940 --> 02:41:37,000
America's the only really powerful good 
guy in the world.

4116
02:41:37,001 --> 02:41:40,210
And thank God for you.
Thank God for you,

4117
02:41:40,211 --> 02:41:43,720
the state of the world,
if it weren't for America and you know,

4118
02:41:44,110 --> 02:41:46,900
it's a sort of brinkmanship like con 
really,

4119
02:41:46,901 --> 02:41:48,520
you know,
if all the bad guys wants to act,

4120
02:41:48,521 --> 02:41:50,020
America couldn't fight them all off at 
once,

4121
02:41:50,021 --> 02:41:50,290
you know.

4122
02:41:50,290 --> 02:41:52,090
So if they were smart,
they would all just do what they want.

4123
02:41:52,091 --> 02:41:53,200
You know,
like Russia would be like,

4124
02:41:53,320 --> 02:41:54,011
yeah,
okay Muslims,

4125
02:41:54,011 --> 02:41:55,630
you have Europe and we'll have America,
you know,

4126
02:41:55,750 --> 02:41:57,520
like that in China.
God knows,

4127
02:41:57,521 --> 02:41:58,890
you know,
that could happen in America,

4128
02:41:58,900 --> 02:42:00,450
couldn't take them all on at once,
but the,

4129
02:42:00,451 --> 02:42:03,690
the risk of going to war with America is
so great that the world doesn't,

4130
02:42:03,710 --> 02:42:04,031
it,
you know,

4131
02:42:04,031 --> 02:42:05,800
is,
is essentially peaceful.

4132
02:42:05,920 --> 02:42:08,440
You know?
Thank God for you guys.

4133
02:42:08,560 --> 02:42:10,780
Thank God there's one superpower.
Yeah,

4134
02:42:10,781 --> 02:42:12,670
this one's super as imaginative as King 
Jong,

4135
02:42:12,700 --> 02:42:13,533
Il.
Thank God that that super power is 

4136
02:42:14,651 --> 02:42:17,560
America and not China,
not Russia,

4137
02:42:17,610 --> 02:42:19,840
not Iran.
India.

4138
02:42:19,960 --> 02:42:21,780
And it calls.
It could and it could be if,

4139
02:42:21,800 --> 02:42:24,490
if the left succeeds in destroying this 
country.

4140
02:42:24,640 --> 02:42:26,590
But don't you think that the people that
are on the left,

4141
02:42:26,620 --> 02:42:29,140
they,
they don't believe that that's the case?

4142
02:42:29,170 --> 02:42:30,003
Yeah.
They don't believe,

4143
02:42:30,190 --> 02:42:31,720
they don't believe America is a good 
thing.

4144
02:42:31,721 --> 02:42:33,190
They don't believe it said was a good 
thing.

4145
02:42:33,191 --> 02:42:34,024
They don't believe there are global 
because the children with no 

4146
02:42:37,811 --> 02:42:39,760
understanding of geography,
history or anything else,

4147
02:42:39,761 --> 02:42:42,820
they don't appreciate how America keeps 
the world's safe.

4148
02:42:43,030 --> 02:42:43,863
And you can disagree with individual 
military actions and many reasonable 

4149
02:42:47,291 --> 02:42:48,124
people,
and I might even be persuaded into this 

4150
02:42:50,050 --> 02:42:51,280
position,
this position,

4151
02:42:51,281 --> 02:42:53,080
many reasonable people think 
Afghanistan,

4152
02:42:53,081 --> 02:42:54,910
Iraq and all of the recent wars are a 
disaster.

4153
02:42:54,911 --> 02:42:56,350
Why going to Vietnam?
Right?

4154
02:42:56,650 --> 02:42:57,483
Perfectly reasonable,
respectable points of view that I do 

4155
02:42:58,931 --> 02:42:59,764
respect and I enjoy discussing with 
people cause I like finding out about 

4156
02:43:02,051 --> 02:43:03,820
these things that I don't know 
everything about right.

4157
02:43:04,420 --> 02:43:05,253
Love to have the discussions.
Very important that America reflects on 

4158
02:43:07,481 --> 02:43:09,340
what it's done before.
So x better in the future.

4159
02:43:10,300 --> 02:43:14,440
But to say that it's to suggest that the
world isn't a better place for America's

4160
02:43:14,441 --> 02:43:14,860
presence.

4161
02:43:14,860 --> 02:43:17,920
And preeminence is absurd.
Well,

4162
02:43:17,950 --> 02:43:20,520
in this stage of the game,
when you're looking at the alternative,

4163
02:43:20,890 --> 02:43:24,220
the alternative being Putin being China,
you know,

4164
02:43:24,221 --> 02:43:25,054
I mean we,
we do have some legitimate dictators 

4165
02:43:27,070 --> 02:43:29,650
that are out there in the world that 
killed their adversaries.

4166
02:43:29,770 --> 02:43:31,390
Of course.
I mean Putin is,

4167
02:43:31,960 --> 02:43:36,550
he is the most gangster of gangsters 
when it comes to a public leader,

4168
02:43:36,820 --> 02:43:39,100
like a guy who is,
it's,

4169
02:43:39,101 --> 02:43:42,820
there's no shadow dealings.
He's killing people in broad daylight.

4170
02:43:43,040 --> 02:43:43,900
Yeah,
yeah,

4171
02:43:43,901 --> 02:43:46,240
he is.
And you think about that as,

4172
02:43:46,241 --> 02:43:47,680
again,
we came back what we said earlier about,

4173
02:43:47,710 --> 02:43:50,550
you know,
America's values and this was it.

4174
02:43:50,650 --> 02:43:52,030
Margaret Thatcher used to say this to 
country,

4175
02:43:52,031 --> 02:43:54,790
not founded on nationality,
whatever it founded on principle.

4176
02:43:55,030 --> 02:43:56,290
Yeah.
Um,

4177
02:43:56,800 --> 02:43:57,633
and I think that's true and I think 
Americans are quite keenly aware of 

4178
02:44:01,001 --> 02:44:01,834
that.
So why they care about the first and 

4179
02:44:02,951 --> 02:44:03,784
second amendments and some of the others
and why they care about freedom of 

4180
02:44:06,191 --> 02:44:07,910
speech and liberty and prosperity and 
you know,

4181
02:44:08,040 --> 02:44:09,010
freedom and property rights,
all,

4182
02:44:09,011 --> 02:44:09,844
it's kind of stuff.

4183
02:44:10,270 --> 02:44:10,761
And,
and,

4184
02:44:10,761 --> 02:44:11,381
and,
you know,

4185
02:44:11,381 --> 02:44:13,390
obviously the,
the capitalism that has made all of that

4186
02:44:13,391 --> 02:44:14,224
possible,
this has created a country in which 

4187
02:44:16,631 --> 02:44:19,540
pretty much anyone can do pretty much 
anything now.

4188
02:44:20,950 --> 02:44:23,200
That's great.
You can,

4189
02:44:23,201 --> 02:44:27,100
even,
if you are so inclined and so insane,

4190
02:44:27,970 --> 02:44:30,490
get other people to pay to turn you into
a woman if you want to.

4191
02:44:30,970 --> 02:44:33,430
That's how tolerant and permissive 
American society is,

4192
02:44:33,700 --> 02:44:34,533
you know,
now I might think paying for that 

4193
02:44:36,100 --> 02:44:39,010
insurance companies are paying for that.
Is that what's going on in America?

4194
02:44:39,011 --> 02:44:40,150
I think,
um,

4195
02:44:40,550 --> 02:44:43,480
well yeah,
whole that's what tends to be,

4196
02:44:43,481 --> 02:44:45,640
cause there'll Paul,
so if a girl identifies with a man,

4197
02:44:45,940 --> 02:44:47,440
they,
they can change her.

4198
02:44:47,590 --> 02:44:50,590
I know in well they very rarely pay for 
themselves.

4199
02:44:50,591 --> 02:44:52,180
I think it's a mixture of,
um,

4200
02:44:52,480 --> 02:44:56,440
of insurance companies and Medicare and 
Medicaid because there were poor because

4201
02:44:56,441 --> 02:44:57,580
they're all poor.
Well,

4202
02:44:57,910 --> 02:45:01,450
transsexuals,
transgender folk as the left wants us to

4203
02:45:01,451 --> 02:45:02,550
call them,
uh,

4204
02:45:02,590 --> 02:45:03,423
are vastly,
disproportionately a socioeconomically 

4205
02:45:05,891 --> 02:45:06,610
underprivileged.

4206
02:45:06,610 --> 02:45:08,320
What about Bruce Jenner?
Rich as fuck.

4207
02:45:08,350 --> 02:45:09,001
Yeah,
but he's,

4208
02:45:09,001 --> 02:45:10,300
he's an outlier most,
most,

4209
02:45:10,550 --> 02:45:13,390
most,
most transgender people.

4210
02:45:13,540 --> 02:45:15,140
Well,
it sounds like a rebel to be.

4211
02:45:15,880 --> 02:45:16,540
Yeah.
And he's not,

4212
02:45:16,540 --> 02:45:17,800
he's not that,
he's not that cool,

4213
02:45:18,250 --> 02:45:21,340
uh,
leather straps to be strictly accurate.

4214
02:45:21,341 --> 02:45:25,030
All you can say is that transgender 
people are disproportionately poor and,

4215
02:45:25,180 --> 02:45:27,220
uh,
socioeconomically underprivileged.

4216
02:45:27,221 --> 02:45:28,054
They come,
they come from low orders and tend to 

4217
02:45:29,981 --> 02:45:31,540
have much in their bank account.
So yeah,

4218
02:45:31,550 --> 02:45:31,950
it's,
it's,

4219
02:45:31,950 --> 02:45:33,310
I think it's a mixture of,
you know,

4220
02:45:33,370 --> 02:45:36,760
insurance companies like health stuff 
you have here,

4221
02:45:36,761 --> 02:45:38,650
which always miss.
It's so confusing to me.

4222
02:45:38,860 --> 02:45:40,660
These weird,
complex things you have,

4223
02:45:40,661 --> 02:45:42,730
just get rid of them.
Uh,

4224
02:45:42,731 --> 02:45:43,564
you don't want this,
this creeping national health service 

4225
02:45:45,461 --> 02:45:46,430
you seem to have here.
It's,

4226
02:45:46,590 --> 02:45:47,423
it's crazy.
But,

4227
02:45:47,650 --> 02:45:48,510
uh,
yeah,

4228
02:45:48,530 --> 02:45:49,300
I,
it's,

4229
02:45:49,300 --> 02:45:50,133
it's certainly in the UK,
it's completely taxpayer funded and 

4230
02:45:51,511 --> 02:45:52,780
everywhere in Europe,
Canada,

4231
02:45:52,900 --> 02:45:55,210
transgender operations,
completely taxpayer funded.

4232
02:45:55,210 --> 02:45:56,050
Yep.
Now,

4233
02:45:56,051 --> 02:45:56,884
how do they determine whether or not 
someone's valuable or viable doctors do 

4234
02:45:59,651 --> 02:46:00,550
that?
They just say,

4235
02:46:00,551 --> 02:46:01,384
yeah,
this guy.

4236
02:46:01,450 --> 02:46:02,283
But meanwhile,
the doctors have a vested interest in 

4237
02:46:04,240 --> 02:46:05,860
performing more of the surgeries.
Yes,

4238
02:46:05,861 --> 02:46:06,910
they do.
Yes,

4239
02:46:06,911 --> 02:46:07,690
they do.
Oh.

4240
02:46:07,690 --> 02:46:09,040
And,
uh,

4241
02:46:09,290 --> 02:46:11,870
of course,
uh,

4242
02:46:11,871 --> 02:46:12,704
if somebody is really insistent and this
happens more than you would think and 

4243
02:46:15,711 --> 02:46:16,544
it's not reported on very often,
it's very difficult to find someone to 

4244
02:46:18,891 --> 02:46:19,724
go on record about this stuff.
But you'll find that very often when 

4245
02:46:23,481 --> 02:46:25,830
somebody wants to go in for the surgery 
and the doctors know no,

4246
02:46:25,850 --> 02:46:26,683
they will start kicking up a fast,
they might accuse the doctor of 

4247
02:46:29,811 --> 02:46:30,644
transphobia asked for another doctor.
People basically who people who want 

4248
02:46:33,591 --> 02:46:36,800
this stuff or mad.
So they act like mad people.

4249
02:46:36,801 --> 02:46:37,634
So they will go doctor shopping and they
will go round every doctor until 

4250
02:46:39,831 --> 02:46:41,480
somebody says yes,
they will acute,

4251
02:46:41,481 --> 02:46:43,220
they will,
they will like beg,

4252
02:46:43,221 --> 02:46:44,960
borrow and steal for money to,
you know,

4253
02:46:44,961 --> 02:46:47,150
to do,
to do crazy stuff to themselves.

4254
02:46:47,420 --> 02:46:52,420
They will insist in and cry foul and 
bully and yell at doctors until they get

4255
02:46:52,851 --> 02:46:54,260
what they want.
I mean,

4256
02:46:54,261 --> 02:46:57,140
doctors are only humans.
Some of the must just want an easy life.

4257
02:46:57,170 --> 02:46:58,460
You know,
somebody comes in and says,

4258
02:46:58,461 --> 02:47:00,080
I want to be a woman in there.
Clearly unhinged.

4259
02:47:00,081 --> 02:47:02,210
At some point of Dr.
Number 17,

4260
02:47:02,240 --> 02:47:03,380
somebody is going to be like,
do you know what?

4261
02:47:03,381 --> 02:47:04,214
Fuck it.

4262
02:47:05,800 --> 02:47:06,633
Well,
I think you managed to Piss all the 

4263
02:47:08,391 --> 02:47:10,340
right people off today.
I'm glad.

4264
02:47:10,640 --> 02:47:12,290
I'm glad.
If you've been offended by this show,

4265
02:47:12,320 --> 02:47:13,153
good.

4266
02:47:13,400 --> 02:47:18,050
I think you probably converted 17 or 18 
people to voting for trump.

4267
02:47:18,170 --> 02:47:19,550
That's all I ask.
That's all.

4268
02:47:19,560 --> 02:47:21,380
I was 20 people a day and I would have 
done my bit.

4269
02:47:21,410 --> 02:47:23,870
I think you probably get,
it's probably closing in on 20.

4270
02:47:24,260 --> 02:47:25,910
It's splendid.
Um,

4271
02:47:25,970 --> 02:47:28,130
how many transgender people are mad at 
you right now?

4272
02:47:28,550 --> 02:47:30,620
Oh No,
they shouldn't be mad because I,

4273
02:47:30,621 --> 02:47:33,500
you know,
yeah,

4274
02:47:33,501 --> 02:47:35,080
they should be mad based.
Probably be pissed.

4275
02:47:35,081 --> 02:47:35,900
Really pissed.
Yeah.

4276
02:47:35,900 --> 02:47:38,570
It's a,
but I think you had some very reasonable

4277
02:47:38,571 --> 02:47:39,404
points about what a,
what an odd business that the whole 

4278
02:47:43,371 --> 02:47:46,250
thing is.
America is in a weird place.

4279
02:47:46,340 --> 02:47:50,870
What's also the ideology that we are 
being forced to accept.

4280
02:47:50,871 --> 02:47:52,910
And Kurt Metzger,
who was on the podcast,

4281
02:47:53,300 --> 02:47:57,590
very smart guy and a funny dude,
he grew up a Jehovah's witness.

4282
02:47:57,591 --> 02:47:59,120
Is that what it was?
Or a Moonie showboat.

4283
02:47:59,130 --> 02:47:59,963
Jehovah's Witness.
He grew up in a call this a to dual 

4284
02:48:01,971 --> 02:48:02,470
ones,
right?

4285
02:48:02,470 --> 02:48:03,930
Yes.
Um,

4286
02:48:04,010 --> 02:48:05,420
couple of them go door door,
but

4287
02:48:05,920 --> 02:48:08,230
the Mormons do too,
right?

4288
02:48:09,120 --> 02:48:10,460
I don't know that jeff has messages.
The famous,

4289
02:48:10,540 --> 02:48:12,420
they have the cash town makes me,
I know that just yet.

4290
02:48:12,630 --> 02:48:13,463
Anyway,
point being he acquainted it correctly 

4291
02:48:16,770 --> 02:48:17,603
to this,
this sort of box thinking where you're 

4292
02:48:19,561 --> 02:48:21,990
not allowed to think outside that box.
It's just like religion.

4293
02:48:22,140 --> 02:48:24,090
He's like,
I understand this kind of thinking.

4294
02:48:24,091 --> 02:48:26,790
I grew up with this kind of thinking 
like you can't make me think like this.

4295
02:48:27,060 --> 02:48:30,540
I know what you're doing.
Like this is not rational or objective.

4296
02:48:30,541 --> 02:48:34,050
You're not talking about these things in
a fair way.

4297
02:48:34,230 --> 02:48:35,063
You have a very biased,
very predetermined pattern that you're 

4298
02:48:38,580 --> 02:48:41,340
forcing people into subscribing to.
And if they don't,

4299
02:48:41,610 --> 02:48:42,443
then there's something wrong with them.
They're bigoted or assholes or they're 

4300
02:48:44,920 --> 02:48:47,430
trans phobic or they tried to 
pathologize.

4301
02:48:47,431 --> 02:48:47,741
You know,
if,

4302
02:48:47,741 --> 02:48:48,331
if,
if it's me,

4303
02:48:48,331 --> 02:48:51,630
they call you was self-loathing gay men 
or toxic male,

4304
02:48:51,631 --> 02:48:53,310
masculine,
hate myself.

4305
02:48:53,311 --> 02:48:55,710
I just don't agree with you.
Well,

4306
02:48:55,740 --> 02:48:59,190
it's a weird thing when you can't agree 
or you can't disagree with someone.

4307
02:48:59,490 --> 02:49:00,251
Like you're,
you're,

4308
02:49:00,251 --> 02:49:04,070
you're not allowed to debate it.
The discussion is closed and this is a,

4309
02:49:04,071 --> 02:49:06,600
it's,
this is not like as simple as is hot,

4310
02:49:06,601 --> 02:49:08,250
hot is cold,
cold,

4311
02:49:08,490 --> 02:49:09,660
you know,
his metal hard.

4312
02:49:09,690 --> 02:49:11,430
Now these are things,
these are complicated.

4313
02:49:11,460 --> 02:49:12,293
The etiology of homosexuality is complex
and nuanced and maybe different for 

4314
02:49:15,331 --> 02:49:16,164
different people.
The correct treatment pathway for 

4315
02:49:18,151 --> 02:49:18,984
transgenderism is complex and nuanced 
and may be different for different 

4316
02:49:21,571 --> 02:49:22,404
people.
The left simply doesn't make space for 

4317
02:49:24,001 --> 02:49:25,830
the,
for how complex life really is.

4318
02:49:26,130 --> 02:49:28,920
They demand this sort of conformity from
everybody else.

4319
02:49:29,160 --> 02:49:30,150
You know,
if you're gay,

4320
02:49:30,151 --> 02:49:33,120
you can't be a Catholic,
you must hate yourself and one of you is

4321
02:49:33,121 --> 02:49:33,954
in confidence.
Yet they demand that we accept their 

4322
02:49:35,700 --> 02:49:37,290
crazy self descriptions.
You know,

4323
02:49:37,291 --> 02:49:38,124
I'm a gender Queer nonbinary,
whatever the height of hypocrisy and at 

4324
02:49:42,241 --> 02:49:43,350
the same time,
you know,

4325
02:49:43,370 --> 02:49:45,240
we,
they expect us to,

4326
02:49:45,510 --> 02:49:48,180
if not believe,
at least publicly go along with lies,

4327
02:49:48,420 --> 02:49:51,480
lies that over simplify the complex 
realities of life.

4328
02:49:51,750 --> 02:49:56,750
Now people are messy and imperfect.
We are all on a not to get too,

4329
02:49:56,880 --> 02:50:00,420
you know what have a bucket veeder I 
don't know.

4330
02:50:00,420 --> 02:50:02,190
I don't even have a vocabulary for 
mysticism.

4331
02:50:02,430 --> 02:50:02,941
Um,
you know,

4332
02:50:02,941 --> 02:50:04,740
not to get too happy.
Woo Woo.

4333
02:50:04,770 --> 02:50:06,420
Yeah.
Not to get too woo woo about it.

4334
02:50:06,421 --> 02:50:07,890
But we are all on a journey through 
life.

4335
02:50:07,891 --> 02:50:08,724
But you know,
growing as you said at the beginning of 

4336
02:50:09,751 --> 02:50:10,980
the show,
evolving,

4337
02:50:10,981 --> 02:50:12,570
becoming different people every,
you know,

4338
02:50:12,571 --> 02:50:14,190
every,
every six months or even sooner.

4339
02:50:14,580 --> 02:50:17,460
And you know,
life is complicated.

4340
02:50:17,461 --> 02:50:18,294
And one of the things that depresses me 
as somebody who enjoys reading and 

4341
02:50:21,061 --> 02:50:21,894
learning is the oversimplification of 
life by the left into into okay people 

4342
02:50:27,810 --> 02:50:32,810
and bigots and if you don't agree with 
specific and very often insane points of

4343
02:50:33,391 --> 02:50:34,224
view,
points of view that contradict medical 

4344
02:50:35,131 --> 02:50:35,964
science points you with a contradict 
common sense points of view that at a 

4345
02:50:38,341 --> 02:50:42,480
bare minimum are highly debatable if you
do not go along with this stuff,

4346
02:50:42,540 --> 02:50:43,373
this ever increasingly mad stuff,
you know this stuff that is his 

4347
02:50:45,660 --> 02:50:47,670
wandering off into,
into crazy territory.

4348
02:50:48,110 --> 02:50:53,110
You were in big land and the left has 
excluded so many of us for so long,

4349
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:55,380
gays,
blacks,

4350
02:50:55,410 --> 02:50:56,243
you know,
printed of blacks feel totally anti 

4351
02:50:57,150 --> 02:50:58,950
black lives matter.
I would imagine most of them in fact,

4352
02:50:59,460 --> 02:51:00,600
and these people are called,
you know,

4353
02:51:00,601 --> 02:51:01,434
Uncle Toms and all the rest of it.
And it happened on stage one of my 

4354
02:51:02,761 --> 02:51:05,400
talks.
If you don't go along with all of this,

4355
02:51:05,820 --> 02:51:08,070
there's something wrong with you,
you're pathologized all the rest of it.

4356
02:51:08,071 --> 02:51:12,750
Well the left has created by doing this,
the outright me,

4357
02:51:13,170 --> 02:51:17,370
Donald Trump and a whole army of 
disaffected liberals,

4358
02:51:17,400 --> 02:51:20,580
it's own former supporters who are tired
of being told what they can think,

4359
02:51:20,610 --> 02:51:21,540
say,
do,

4360
02:51:21,630 --> 02:51:22,830
how they can dress,
how they can speak,

4361
02:51:22,831 --> 02:51:23,880
cause they can hang out with,
you know,

4362
02:51:23,881 --> 02:51:24,714
what belief systems they can have.
And it has alienated and entire young 

4363
02:51:27,751 --> 02:51:30,240
generation from left wing politics.

4364
02:51:30,450 --> 02:51:31,283
And isn't it hilarious that it kind of 
spawned out of a dispute about video 

4365
02:51:35,131 --> 02:51:37,500
games?
Yes.

4366
02:51:37,560 --> 02:51:40,350
I mean the meek inherited the earth in a
sense.

4367
02:51:40,550 --> 02:51:41,383
Who would have thought?
Who would have thought the stab being 

4368
02:51:42,811 --> 02:51:43,644
meek?
Yeah.

4369
02:51:43,830 --> 02:51:47,280
Well you know it was fucked up when they
tried to take the video games.

4370
02:51:47,281 --> 02:51:49,410
They fuck.
Well because they were involved,

4371
02:51:49,411 --> 02:51:52,110
they'd done it in comic books.
They don't in fantasy down into Scifi,

4372
02:51:52,170 --> 02:51:54,300
but they took on the smart play,
took on the smart,

4373
02:51:54,301 --> 02:51:55,134
exactly.
Took on the PSI fans of the Comic Book 

4374
02:51:57,960 --> 02:52:01,410
Fans Are Nice but gamers card shit,
hot,

4375
02:52:01,470 --> 02:52:03,660
smart.
They are autistic as fuck.

4376
02:52:03,661 --> 02:52:06,370
Which is why I love them because I am,
they are smart.

4377
02:52:06,371 --> 02:52:09,860
They are determined and they'd like to 
organize because they used to they,

4378
02:52:09,861 --> 02:52:11,830
I mean they problem solve for a living.
Yes.

4379
02:52:12,250 --> 02:52:14,230
They're looking at this problem like it 
was a,

4380
02:52:14,231 --> 02:52:14,890
you know,
like,

4381
02:52:14,890 --> 02:52:16,810
like it was again,
what are the victory conditions,

4382
02:52:16,811 --> 02:52:17,200
you know?

4383
02:52:17,200 --> 02:52:18,033
Yeah.
And you don't need to kill everyone on 

4384
02:52:18,791 --> 02:52:20,590
that side.
You just need to get the flight from one

4385
02:52:20,591 --> 02:52:22,270
point to another or you just need to 
this kind of stuff.

4386
02:52:22,360 --> 02:52:25,540
So game has realized,
I don't need the press to like us,

4387
02:52:25,720 --> 02:52:26,553
you know,
and you can call us misogynistic 

4388
02:52:27,221 --> 02:52:28,360
harassers on the Internet if you want 
to.

4389
02:52:28,390 --> 02:52:29,223
All we want is these feminists lunatics 
to get out of gaming and for people to 

4390
02:52:32,651 --> 02:52:34,240
leave the creators alone to do what they
want.

4391
02:52:34,510 --> 02:52:35,650
And for,
you know,

4392
02:52:35,651 --> 02:52:36,484
for journalists to start reporting 
honestly about games and stop hating on 

4393
02:52:38,771 --> 02:52:40,210
their own,
on their own,

4394
02:52:40,240 --> 02:52:41,073
you know,
uh,

4395
02:52:41,590 --> 02:52:43,420
uh,
audiences or just fuck off.

4396
02:52:43,450 --> 02:52:44,283
You know what's interesting too is how 
much bullshit they've exposed in that 

4397
02:52:47,621 --> 02:52:51,520
industry and in the people that are 
criticizing them who make video games.

4398
02:52:51,590 --> 02:52:54,070
Yes,
actually are they're guilty of doing the

4399
02:52:54,071 --> 02:52:56,030
exact same thing that these people are 
criticizing,

4400
02:52:56,050 --> 02:52:57,220
exposed hypocrisy.

4401
02:52:57,740 --> 02:53:01,430
They've exposed collusion,
double think collusion that,

4402
02:53:01,600 --> 02:53:04,180
that litter match underneath,
um,

4403
02:53:04,420 --> 02:53:06,380
you know,
sort of overwhelming weight,

4404
02:53:06,430 --> 02:53:08,580
but it's around harassment.
Um,

4405
02:53:09,730 --> 02:53:10,563
it lit a match underneath so many 
different people in so many different 

4406
02:53:13,391 --> 02:53:16,570
worlds when people looked out and they 
realize that you can beat them,

4407
02:53:16,930 --> 02:53:19,990
you can beat them if you don't give a 
shit what the press says about you.

4408
02:53:20,050 --> 02:53:22,210
And why would you,
and Donald Trump has proven also that if

4409
02:53:22,211 --> 02:53:23,380
you don't give a shit what the press 
about,

4410
02:53:23,710 --> 02:53:25,210
what the press says about you get 
stronger,

4411
02:53:25,211 --> 02:53:26,200
not weaker,
you know,

4412
02:53:26,590 --> 02:53:27,423
uh,
if you don't care what polite society 

4413
02:53:29,351 --> 02:53:30,640
says about you,
you can win.

4414
02:53:30,940 --> 02:53:33,610
You can beat them.
And this has never been done before,

4415
02:53:33,611 --> 02:53:35,470
at least not done for 25 years.
Uh,

4416
02:53:35,500 --> 02:53:36,333
you know,
and I'm not saying it's not about the 

4417
02:53:36,711 --> 02:53:37,544
right winning over the left,
but it's about freedom and 

4418
02:53:39,041 --> 02:53:41,230
libertarianism and the right to do,
say,

4419
02:53:41,231 --> 02:53:42,250
think what you want to play.

4420
02:53:42,250 --> 02:53:43,600
What do you want?
It won.

4421
02:53:43,870 --> 02:53:46,660
It beat the cultural scolds.
It beat the feminists.

4422
02:53:46,661 --> 02:53:47,560
It beat the,
the,

4423
02:53:47,561 --> 02:53:48,310
you know,
the,

4424
02:53:48,310 --> 02:53:53,310
the offense brigade Gamergate one.
And it's has ignited so many fires in so

4425
02:53:54,281 --> 02:53:58,540
many places with so many unexpected 
consequences and wonderful,

4426
02:53:58,600 --> 02:53:59,433
uh,
you know,

4427
02:53:59,690 --> 02:54:01,050
uh,
uh,

4428
02:54:01,090 --> 02:54:04,630
snowball effects elsewhere and culture 
and politics and society.

4429
02:54:04,660 --> 02:54:07,150
It's remarkable.
And we all,

4430
02:54:07,151 --> 02:54:07,984
I think,
who have been give emboldened to speak 

4431
02:54:09,881 --> 02:54:10,714
more plainly encouraged to contradict 
people more often reminded that it is 

4432
02:54:15,311 --> 02:54:16,144
not bigoted to have a different point of
view and that you are entitled to your 

4433
02:54:18,401 --> 02:54:21,460
opinion no matter what it is and 
entitled to say it without fear of being

4434
02:54:21,461 --> 02:54:25,780
called a monster or you know,
suffocated by safe space culture.

4435
02:54:25,781 --> 02:54:29,230
All of those people have video games to 
think as you correctly suggest it.

4436
02:54:29,231 --> 02:54:30,310
It sounds,
you know,

4437
02:54:30,311 --> 02:54:33,070
it sounds ridiculous,
but it is true and you know,

4438
02:54:33,120 --> 02:54:34,720
it's,
it's been a remarkable thing.

4439
02:54:34,720 --> 02:54:36,210
I was very happy that I was at the 
beginning to,

4440
02:54:36,211 --> 02:54:37,940
to watch it all unfold.
Milo,

4441
02:54:37,960 --> 02:54:38,793
we live in strange and exciting times,
