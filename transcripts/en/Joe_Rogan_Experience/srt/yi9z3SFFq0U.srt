1
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:05,660
Boom,
and we live.

2
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:11,170
What happened?
He took your hat off you go and getting 

3
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:11,170
crazy.
Trying to feel,

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:11,170
you know,
I want to feel at home.

5
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:12,350
It's that west coast.
Marijuana due to hits you hard.

6
00:00:12,351 --> 00:00:14,050
Right?
That's hard and fast rule.

7
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,010
It's no joke.
Yeah,

8
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:19,520
it's chemists or whatever they are 
buying estes fucking science dorks.

9
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,460
They've done a good job.
Yeah.

10
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,870
Jesus Christ.
It's not even the same thing anymore.

11
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:24,580
No,
it's,

12
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:25,660
it's,
it's a uh,

13
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:26,690
it's a,
it's,

14
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,730
it's Gmo all the way.
Yeah.

15
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,100
It's like,
Hey,

16
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,110
you guys tested this on people?
Yeah.

17
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,490
It's crazy.
I'm like,

18
00:00:34,491 --> 00:00:36,380
I know you took the seeds out of 
watermelon,

19
00:00:36,381 --> 00:00:39,830
but what the fuck did they do that?
I don't know.

20
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,420
How did that even happen?
I don't know.

21
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,150
I just read that a Barbara streisand 
cloned her dogs.

22
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,710
Did you read that or heard about that?
Jamie told me like the weirdest thing.

23
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:50,930
She has two dogs from one.
That's weird.

24
00:00:50,931 --> 00:00:55,430
It made two clones of her favorite dog.
That is like the polar opposite of adopt

25
00:00:55,431 --> 00:00:56,370
don't shop.
Yeah.

26
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,780
It's like you can't get any further.
Yeah.

27
00:00:58,781 --> 00:01:01,120
It costs like $100,000.
Oh my gosh,

28
00:01:01,121 --> 00:01:03,560
it does.
She can't have a different shape.

29
00:01:03,561 --> 00:01:05,330
It's impossible.
It can't be a different dog.

30
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:06,710
So possible.
Yeah,

31
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:08,000
it's a.
it's a weird.

32
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:13,030
It's a weird move to fuck man.
If you really believed that personality 

33
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:13,910
comes from that,

34
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:19,710
if it's the same thing,
like if it just looks the same or you 

35
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:19,710
don't want it to just look the same,
do you know?

36
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,240
It's supposed to be an identical clone 
of your original doctor,

37
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,670
so it really kind of would really 
stupid.

38
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:28,360
What if it's your favorite dog?
Shit all over the place.

39
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:30,760
Walking into walls where we've got bad 
news.

40
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,200
It doesn't have an asshole.
It just didn't work all the way where we

41
00:01:35,201 --> 00:01:40,201
go to the way it looks like 94 percent 
of your dog and then you know it's 

42
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:44,401
missing an asshole.
It's 30 percent as smart as your last 

43
00:01:44,401 --> 00:01:47,851
dog,
which is pretty good because your last 

44
00:01:47,851 --> 00:01:47,851
dog was a genius.
Also,

45
00:01:47,851 --> 00:01:51,181
there's another dog attached to it 
that's walking in the different 

46
00:01:51,181 --> 00:01:54,841
direction,
so it's eventually going to pull each 

47
00:01:54,841 --> 00:01:54,841
other apart.
But for now,

48
00:01:54,841 --> 00:01:58,180
now you got six to eight weeks with 
these weird to speak for a hundred 

49
00:01:58,271 --> 00:01:58,750
grand.

50
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,550
You could just go to the pound.
The fruit there is.

51
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,470
I have a story that I do my act about a 
pound dog that I had.

52
00:02:05,471 --> 00:02:07,870
I had a pound dog.
They killed one of my dogs.

53
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,810
Wow.
Pound dogs are tricky man.

54
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,080
You know,
you get a dog that's been in like a 

55
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,680
shelter for a long time sometimes.
They were in there for months.

56
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,600
They come out highly aggressive and I'm 
like my,

57
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,830
some of them my dog,
but I got her.

58
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,920
I mean she's 13 now,
but when I got her she was a puppy,

59
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,750
you know,
and they found she was a stray puppy.

60
00:02:28,751 --> 00:02:33,751
She's a little black lab,
like just wandering in the Bronx and I 

61
00:02:33,751 --> 00:02:35,020
got her probably like three days after 
they found her.

62
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,360
What age do you think a dog would have 
to be like,

63
00:02:37,361 --> 00:02:42,361
you got to imagine like a certain amount
of abuse that a dog suffers early and 

64
00:02:42,361 --> 00:02:44,560
it's life before it gets to the pound 
has got a really fuck with his head.

65
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,540
Right?
I think there's dogs that you get at the

66
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:51,541
pound,
you're essentially like taking on and 

67
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:51,541
abused organism.
It's not ugly.

68
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:56,220
It's not just that it doesn't have a 
home is that it might've been in dog 

69
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:56,680
fights,
like I'm pretty sure that mine,

70
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:01,660
either it's family was in dog fights or 
it was in a dog fight and there's,

71
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,920
you know,
people around you that are probably 

72
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:06,920
kicking you and beating you or.
Yeah.

73
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,900
Or you're tied up for hours at a time.
Like,

74
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,870
you know,
you have no free.

75
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,880
I mean who knows,
but I do think dogs can be 

76
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:14,880
rehabilitated,
but I do think it takes.

77
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,520
You have to have a look to even have a 
dog be a good dog like that.

78
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,810
Like I have,
I have,

79
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:24,960
when I had my puppy,
like I worked with my dog so much and 

80
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:24,960
she's a great dog.

81
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,910
Like I could walk in New York City 
without a leash.

82
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,550
Just follows me.
She's really is.

83
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,220
She's amazing.
That's amazing.

84
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,130
But I worked so hard.
And then if you add to that,

85
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,120
you have to first like,
you know,

86
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:39,950
like a brainwash them or get them over 
the anxieties they have.

87
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:44,960
Like there are certain dogs that just 
hate men because obviously in their 

88
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,180
former home and was an abusive man in 
the house and you know,

89
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,950
they react differently to men than 
women,

90
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:49,030
you know.
Sure.

91
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:49,990
Yeah.
Yeah.

92
00:03:49,991 --> 00:03:52,810
You mean you never know.
A dog can't tell you what it's seen?

93
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,170
Nope.
I had one dog that I adopted choose too,

94
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,640
and she had mange all over her body,
like all over her body.

95
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,310
And she looked terrible man.
And they caught her.

96
00:04:03,311 --> 00:04:08,311
I'm eating out of garbage cans in front 
of this family's house that rescues 

97
00:04:08,311 --> 00:04:09,780
pitbulls.
And uh,

98
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:14,320
I took her in and like within a month 
she had hair on her body.

99
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,270
She looked great.
She was healthy,

100
00:04:16,271 --> 00:04:19,270
sweetest dogs,
sweetest dog with people.

101
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:24,190
But if another dog got too close,
she would fuck that dog up there.

102
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,260
It was like,
she was like,

103
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,300
protecting what she had.
It was real.

104
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:31,230
It was real hard to have an aggressive 
like,

105
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,250
pound dog yet.
And uh,

106
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,280
depending on the dog.
But it is like the thing I would always 

107
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,640
tell people to try to do first because I
am a big like adopt,

108
00:04:39,641 --> 00:04:44,641
don't shop guy.
Like if you go to a dog pound you could 

109
00:04:44,641 --> 00:04:45,120
find some amazing where I got my dog if 
you go,

110
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,500
which like animal care and control in 
New York City,

111
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,110
like they euthanized like 100 dogs a 
day.

112
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,980
Like it's literally just like the dogs 
are coming in all the time.

113
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:59,250
Dogs with stab wounds,
dogs they find in the park half day and 

114
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,401
then they like,
they have five days in that pound and 

115
00:05:02,401 --> 00:05:02,401
then they're out.

116
00:05:02,401 --> 00:05:02,530
So it's like I was when I was there,
this is again,

117
00:05:02,531 --> 00:05:07,531
like 13 years ago,
but when I was getting my dog and I was 

118
00:05:07,531 --> 00:05:10,111
waiting to pick her up,
this woman came in with two rottweilers,

119
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,550
beautiful rottweilers and unleashes.
And she goes,

120
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,070
I don't want these anymore.
Oh Man.

121
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,290
That the lady behind the counter.
It's like,

122
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:17,410
well what do you mean like that?
You know?

123
00:05:17,411 --> 00:05:18,970
And she was like,
I just can't handle them.

124
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,770
And then they took the leash and she 
walked out.

125
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,800
And then there were just these two.no,
I don't know if they were trained to 

126
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:25,800
kill or not.
I was going to be like,

127
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,210
ed two rottweilers to my test.
Yeah,

128
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,990
you can't do that.
He knows I have no.

129
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,190
I knew nothing about them,
but I'm like,

130
00:05:30,191 --> 00:05:32,170
well,
in five days those dogs are dead because

131
00:05:32,171 --> 00:05:36,040
they're like four year old rottweilers.
I had a doberman that we adopted as when

132
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:39,300
I was a kid and it had distemper and it 
does.

133
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:44,550
It's a disease that makes them really 
aggressive in this crazy way that dog 

134
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,040
turned on us.
That's scary.

135
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,510
Oh Dude.
It was so scary.

136
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:51,511
I was like,
I couldn't have been more than 12.

137
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,000
I was like,
maybe 12 somewhere around then.

138
00:05:55,001 --> 00:05:58,010
And this big ass Doberman is showing its
teeth

139
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:01,190
and barking and snapping us out of 
nowhere.

140
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,400
It was the sweetest dog before.
And then all of a sudden it's on the 

141
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:06,400
couch,
like looking down on us.

142
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,280
And we were like,
Whoa,

143
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:09,830
what is happening here?
And so,

144
00:06:09,831 --> 00:06:11,330
um,
they,

145
00:06:11,331 --> 00:06:14,270
um,
they came and took the dog,

146
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,880
I think.
Or did we take the dog to the pound?

147
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,610
I don't remember what happened or to the
vet rather,

148
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,640
and then they ran an examination that 
dog and they're like,

149
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:27,430
this dog is tamper so we just,
we've got it with this vineyard disease.

150
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,440
Then that's like,
you can't have that in a house with 

151
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:32,440
kids.
I don't know what the fuck they do.

152
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:32,440
Well,
I was a kid at the time.

153
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,950
My parents weren't having it,
but I don't remember.

154
00:06:33,951 --> 00:06:35,930
Like,
I don't remember too much about it.

155
00:06:35,931 --> 00:06:40,931
They send him to the couch.
I just remembered that dog on the couch 

156
00:06:40,931 --> 00:06:42,380
showing its teeth snapping at us.

157
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,250
Scary.
And I was like,

158
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,720
Oh shit.
We brought home a dog.

159
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,040
He'll full grown dog that has a disease.
My,

160
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,200
uh,
my mom's cousin,

161
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:56,860
second cousin was married to a dude for 
a number of years who have this 

162
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,680
rottweiler that was like a psychotic 
dog.

163
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:02,710
And like at one point it jumped through 
their bake glass windows in their house 

164
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:04,310
to try to get the mailman and got 
caught.

165
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,670
Oh my gosh.
Swing the two windows.

166
00:07:06,671 --> 00:07:08,030
And was,
it was fine.

167
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,700
I mean it had stitches and they had to 
pull some glass out of it.

168
00:07:10,701 --> 00:07:12,320
But it didn't impact the dog,
that's how.

169
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:17,670
And it dove through a window.
It just didn't make it look like it 

170
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,620
would have killed the mail.
It was just because somebody was walking

171
00:07:18,621 --> 00:07:19,870
up their porch,
you know,

172
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:23,240
and the doctors and that same like 
almost one time,

173
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,360
like my grandparents had a house upstate
and they were there,

174
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,260
like my brother opened the door and came
out and you know,

175
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:27,830
it was just like.

176
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,460
But some people just like having like a 
scary dog.

177
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:35,990
That's not the kind of dog you just want
to run at a kid that you don't know.

178
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:39,230
People get killed on it.
It certainly can happen,

179
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,260
especially if it's like really 
aggressive with people like that.

180
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:43,880
Like Jesus,
that's so dangerous.

181
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:45,190
It's a monster.
Yeah.

182
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:46,640
And they're cute,
right?

183
00:07:46,641 --> 00:07:51,641
Whether it's like 110 and it is those 
big males,

184
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,660
those big fucking frying pan heads.
They're giant flatheads.

185
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:01,690
It's funny too because we're talking 
about like genetic modifications or 

186
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:01,690
cloning,
but really dogs,

187
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:05,591
if you looked at them historically that 
they've been that the whole time like 

188
00:08:05,591 --> 00:08:09,011
Ben have,
man has manipulated what they wanted of 

189
00:08:09,011 --> 00:08:09,230
certain animals and like they've bred 
the,

190
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:10,850
the,
the meanest,

191
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,060
toughest ones to be guard dogs and they 
bred the cutest.

192
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:17,780
Take a piss on a paper.
Matt wants to be left alone.

193
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:21,350
Those are all choices that were made by 
humans by humans.

194
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,360
It overtime by continued breeding of 
ones that were the same and same and 

195
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,561
same.
You end up with like breeds and things 

196
00:08:29,561 --> 00:08:29,561
like,
man,

197
00:08:29,561 --> 00:08:29,600
I really like played a huge role in the 
kind of dog man.

198
00:08:29,601 --> 00:08:30,820
Did the whole thing.
Yeah,

199
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,100
because when they did the genome,
the DNA.

200
00:08:34,101 --> 00:08:35,030
It's a wolf.
Yeah.

201
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,560
Every dog is a wolf.
Yeah.

202
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,240
No matter how big the dog is,
isn't that crazy?

203
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:43,880
Think about how powerful and terrifying 
and Majestical Wolf is,

204
00:08:43,881 --> 00:08:48,881
right?
I mean it's one of the most amazing 

205
00:08:48,881 --> 00:08:51,130
creatures in the forest and agree more 
and we found just the one that was just 

206
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,320
slightly bitch ass,
just slightly bitch ass really come on.

207
00:08:54,321 --> 00:08:55,470
And the campfire,
Bro,

208
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,300
dude,
we got free food and he was like,

209
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,430
oh good.
I can just say,

210
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:04,450
hey man,
I like your hair is poking up like this 

211
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:04,450
dude,
just relax,

212
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:04,450
relax for years.

213
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,690
I thank you to alert you look into 
camera.

214
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,940
And then they found a male that was 
like,

215
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:13,941
that we should make.
They figured out a way to get the bitch 

216
00:09:13,941 --> 00:09:18,141
ass family.
They stayed real close to them to fuck 

217
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:18,141
each other.
She's like,

218
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:21,470
they were like,
let's take the two smallest ones and 

219
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,211
make them do you know?
And then they probably dog houses and I 

220
00:09:23,211 --> 00:09:26,850
bet doghouses changed the game.
Like this is amazing.

221
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,370
We're in,
I'll have to be a wolf.

222
00:09:29,371 --> 00:09:34,371
So alleles,
extra hair gets covered and not having 

223
00:09:34,371 --> 00:09:34,371
to hunt every day.
It's like,

224
00:09:34,371 --> 00:09:34,680
this is great.
I want white curly hair.

225
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,390
I'm a poodle now.
Motherfucker,

226
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,860
excuse me.
I'd like a perm and fucking with my name

227
00:09:42,861 --> 00:09:47,861
on it.
They make them like puffy with this 

228
00:09:47,861 --> 00:09:49,500
amazingly food food dog,
but it's still a dog.

229
00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:51,060
That dog will fuck you up.
Yep.

230
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,560
So poodles are ruthless and those things
will come out.

231
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:00,560
Yeah.
Puddles probably have an attitude to 

232
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:00,560
like no one takes them seriously.
Like if you had yo,

233
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,350
I got a bunch of guard dogs.
What do you got?

234
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:05,250
The 90 pound poodles just shut the fuck 
up.

235
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,710
Oh my God.
Still a dog thing.

236
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:12,750
It would be so funny if that thing that 
looked like a Barbie toy,

237
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,210
right?
It looks like a Barbie Toy.

238
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,650
Doesn't even look a real dog.
That dog will fuck you up.

239
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:21,670
It'll bite your dick off.
But I have to say I feel bad when I see 

240
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,280
dogs have that haircut,
like they have no part in it.

241
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:28,550
You know what I mean?
Like they're just jamie showing us a 

242
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,250
picture of dogs with braids on.
Okay,

243
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,740
now seriously wearing slippers.
Is that cultural appropriation a little.

244
00:10:33,741 --> 00:10:35,070
How does that work?
A little bit.

245
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,940
I feel like it might be there a white 
dog.

246
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,970
They're stealing from Santa Claus,
so get the colors.

247
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:42,330
They got Sanas gang colors.
Got People just,

248
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:45,810
you know,
like what in the fuck is that?

249
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,970
Okay,
what in the fuck did they do this dog?

250
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:53,040
We're looking at a dog body is a,
is a pink snail and I'm not joking.

251
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:58,041
It looks like a pink snail,
like a swirly with with hot pink 

252
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:58,920
accents.
Is that how you'd say it?

253
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:02,420
Stripes and it's back leg as a flower.
Yeah,

254
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:05,070
it's fucking preposterous.
Spray painted.

255
00:11:05,071 --> 00:11:06,930
They spray painted.
Ray painted to dog.

256
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,560
That dog is dying.
That's chemicals.

257
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:14,570
It has green hair too.
It says the poodles transformed into 

258
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:14,970
pandas.
Horses don't do that.

259
00:11:14,971 --> 00:11:17,500
You fuck even snails.
You've seen the ones that they used.

260
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:22,700
They take certain dogs.
They make them look like a lion with 

261
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,730
doctor Campbell flipped the fuck did 
they do to this dog?

262
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,760
They turned it into a camel.

263
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:31,620
Is so mean.
This is just the same abuse.

264
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,120
Come on,
it says Cindy,

265
00:11:33,121 --> 00:11:36,450
the poodle already bad.
It's like hitting a dog in my opinion.

266
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,470
So city,
the poodle.

267
00:11:37,471 --> 00:11:38,680
Just as a new look.
Every year,

268
00:11:38,681 --> 00:11:41,100
a little madonna and nineties.
Oh Cindy.

269
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,980
Now Cindy.
Oh my God.

270
00:11:43,981 --> 00:11:46,560
Cindy wacky parents.
Oh my God.

271
00:11:46,561 --> 00:11:48,670
That's a different dog.
Turn this dog into a pan.

272
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:53,580
It's hair white and black and you magic 
wand over someone's house started like,

273
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:58,090
fuck it,
I'm not in an exotic wildlife.

274
00:11:58,091 --> 00:12:03,091
Excuse me.
You have a camel and a pant in your 

275
00:12:03,091 --> 00:12:03,091
front yard.
Hey Dude,

276
00:12:03,091 --> 00:12:04,860
I can't bear.
I can't pay your bare family.

277
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,700
Dude.
They turned it into a horse.

278
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:10,030
This is deal turned digital football 
player killer.

279
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:13,300
For folks who are just listening,
what is the name of this,

280
00:12:13,301 --> 00:12:18,301
Jamie?
Because we have to tell people about 

281
00:12:18,301 --> 00:12:18,301
this.
It's a poodle transformed in the pandas,

282
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,890
snails,
cetera.

283
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,200
Google that,
and you'll find it.

284
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:26,540
It's one of them.
They turn it into a bison.

285
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,290
Did they put a mask on it with a glue?
A mass to attend?

286
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,230
These monsters are horrible.
What they do,

287
00:12:32,231 --> 00:12:33,460
the dog,
they gave him a muzzle.

288
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,260
A muzzle.
Yeah.

289
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:39,360
They put a muzzle on it,
so it looks like a football helmet that 

290
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:39,360
he couldn't be a football player from 
the thirties.

291
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,251
You know,
you had to have one with the face where 

292
00:12:44,251 --> 00:12:44,251
they put a wig on.
How'd they do the Buffalo?

293
00:12:44,251 --> 00:12:45,870
The buffalo doesn't even make sense.
Scroll back up again.

294
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:48,280
Then brewster,
scroll back up to the Buffalo.

295
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:51,100
Where's the knows?
Where's his actual head?

296
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,830
Oh,
so they put something over at Ted.

297
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:53,830
I don't know.
Look at that.

298
00:12:53,831 --> 00:12:57,710
It looks like they put a outfit on him.
Where's his head?

299
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,950
Seems mean.
This is like extra years.

300
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,930
You think they put a basket on them?

301
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:05,830
It looks like this is so fucked up.
So now you are aware of Wolf?

302
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,150
No,
I'm just a dog man.

303
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,240
Oh,
can I just cocked off?

304
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,600
Oh,
the last one.

305
00:13:10,601 --> 00:13:13,740
They turned it into a peacock.
He literally glued feathers to its ass.

306
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:15,890
Asset is just,
it's just,

307
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:20,980
it looks like it might be actually just 
standing there and they have the 

308
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:20,980
feathers propped up against the wall.
Possibly.

309
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:23,140
Am I seeing that correctly?
But the other stuff has done to it.

310
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,860
I think that's what the platform night.
Yeah.

311
00:13:26,861 --> 00:13:28,730
It's unfortunate.
Not Nice.

312
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,350
Like it just seems like you got a dog 
for the wrong reason,

313
00:13:32,351 --> 00:13:33,480
you know?
You know.

314
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:38,490
Go get a fucking Mr potatohead dog 
doing.

315
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:43,290
How about decorate your house?
God Damn Dog,

316
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,400
man Christ.
I don't know.

317
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,320
People are terrible.
Terrible.

318
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,340
They're gross.
Make so many bad decisions,

319
00:13:51,341 --> 00:13:56,341
but it's interesting that one of the 
things that was coming out of South 

320
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:59,590
Korea during the Olympics was people 
were talking about,

321
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,990
um,
in Asian countries,

322
00:14:01,991 --> 00:14:03,520
the consumption of dogs.

323
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:07,150
That became a big hot point issue with a
lot of people.

324
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,400
Yeah.
It's,

325
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:12,060
it is weird that we choose certain 
animals,

326
00:14:12,061 --> 00:14:14,080
that it's okay to kill and eat.
I could agree more,

327
00:14:14,081 --> 00:14:15,370
man.
I think that our,

328
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,020
our food hangups are so specific to our 
country.

329
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:21,010
I think about it all.
But a bacon,

330
00:14:21,011 --> 00:14:24,490
egg and cheese sandwich is fried pig's 
ass.

331
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:29,740
Unfertilized embryo and mold.
Well that's not true and bold,

332
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:34,860
but what do you mean video but not going
to die today.

333
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,640
Right.
It's an egg.

334
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:37,510
Yeah.
Yeah.

335
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,600
And it's.
Sometimes you ever crack an egg and 

336
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,110
there's a little chicken in there.
I never had that.

337
00:14:43,111 --> 00:14:44,920
I've had a little extra things in there.
No,

338
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:47,110
I've had like a little grow.
Most really?

339
00:14:47,111 --> 00:14:48,520
Yeah.
Not like a full chicken,

340
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:49,000
but like,
oh,

341
00:14:49,001 --> 00:14:50,290
that's going to be a chicken.
You know,

342
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,980
I was in my before I

343
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:56,980
knew that an egg couldn't become a 
chicken because I never thought about 

344
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,390
until I had to get the rooster.
I haven't been in the hen house.

345
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,420
I didn't know were they just laugh all 
the time.

346
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:07,450
Yep.
I didn't know that until I was in my 

347
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:07,450
forties.
What you got to,

348
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:10,040
you got to be in a forum setting to know
that you imagine if you were a farmer,

349
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:15,041
what a fucking asshole you would think 
somebody is that you offer on your 

350
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:16,520
chickens.
They'd get someone that didn't know.

351
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:19,510
You didn't know if that couldn't just 
become a chicken like no.

352
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:24,140
It's like this one things where it's 
people that are vegetarians,

353
00:15:24,141 --> 00:15:26,720
I urge you to eat eggs,
eat eggs.

354
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,490
It's a free ride.
They just coming out anyway.

355
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,980
They're coming out,
coming out anyway.

356
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:36,010
If you get it,
you can get it from a place like just 

357
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,820
like you can get organic grass fed beef,
you can get pasture raised chickens.

358
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,190
They do have that.
Then pasture raised chicken,

359
00:15:40,191 --> 00:15:42,200
eggs.
The yolks come out dark.

360
00:15:42,201 --> 00:15:43,430
You just got to figure out where to get 
them to.

361
00:15:43,431 --> 00:15:48,431
Not as they're more expensive,
but they're not as expensive as meat.

362
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,430
Right.
I mean,

363
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,090
they're really good for it to last a 
surprisingly long time.

364
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:58,150
It's a free ride.
That chicken is going to eat all that 

365
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:58,160
stuff on the ground.
The bugs and all the worms.

366
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,470
If you don't want to kill anything,
just eat those eggs.

367
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,360
It's good for you.
Very good for you.

368
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:04,920
You're fucking amazing for you.
God.

369
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,130
Damn.
I'm anti big propaganda.

370
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,280
Do big.
Yeah.

371
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,660
I can eat eggs every morning.
I do.

372
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,410
I eat them almost every day.
Yeah.

373
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:18,730
Yeah.
I just think that it's one of the most 

374
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:22,061
Karma free things,
like you've got to exchange with these 

375
00:16:22,061 --> 00:16:22,220
animals.
Like I haven't exchange.

376
00:16:22,221 --> 00:16:24,950
I give the animals food.
They eat the food.

377
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,900
They lay the eggs.
I'm nice to them.

378
00:16:26,901 --> 00:16:29,510
I come into their little caged area.
They don't run from me.

379
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,340
They'd come around and give him little 
treats and shit.

380
00:16:31,341 --> 00:16:32,380
They're like pets.
Yeah.

381
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:36,110
They have this really cool life.
They get to wander around occasionally.

382
00:16:36,111 --> 00:16:38,070
They get jacked by coyotes.
Really?

383
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,490
I've had a three,
but how?

384
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,050
How?
How much are they?

385
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,790
They're not in a two.
At least two.

386
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:49,090
One of them.
I'm suspicious that you don't have them 

387
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:49,090
in a coop.
Man.

388
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:49,880
It's a fucked up story.
I've told it before.

389
00:16:49,881 --> 00:16:54,881
I'll briefly tell it again.
My massive got honey dicked by female 

390
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:56,180
coyote.
Oh my God.

391
00:16:56,210 --> 00:17:01,210
And he thought the coyote was his buddy 
and he got to know this is,

392
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:07,150
I should say that my gender,
gender identifying with this coyote,

393
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:11,000
I did not have a chance to really 
closely examine it.

394
00:17:11,001 --> 00:17:15,920
I'm just being a,
it's for the good of the story.

395
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:20,920
This is what I think is my theory.
I think it's a littler coyote and I 

396
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,761
really think it was a female.
It was hanging around my house for 

397
00:17:24,761 --> 00:17:26,550
awhile and it talked my dog and then 
knocking down a fence and he's huge.

398
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:31,890
And when he got through the fence,
he got to the chicken coop and one of 

399
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:32,480
the chickens,
uh,

400
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:35,180
was doing a thing called brooding.
And when they brewed,

401
00:17:35,181 --> 00:17:40,181
they,
they're convinced that if they sit on 

402
00:17:40,181 --> 00:17:42,371
their egg that that egg is going to turn
into a chicken convinced they just to 

403
00:17:42,371 --> 00:17:43,670
get like a little depressed to get 
nutty.

404
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,330
And what you have to do when they're 
brooding is you have to take them off of

405
00:17:47,331 --> 00:17:50,610
the nest and put them in a cage by 
themselves with just a perch.

406
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:55,820
So they just sit on the perch for like a
day or two and then it leaves their 

407
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:55,820
system.

408
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,810
But if you let them lay on it,
it'll take like 30 days.

409
00:17:57,811 --> 00:17:58,940
It takes a long time.
They plucked.

410
00:17:58,941 --> 00:18:02,190
But how do you pluck the feathers off?
But.

411
00:18:02,191 --> 00:18:07,191
So how,
how often are you monitoring your 

412
00:18:07,191 --> 00:18:07,191
chickens that you're like,
oh,

413
00:18:07,191 --> 00:18:07,191
we got a brooder.
Oh,

414
00:18:07,191 --> 00:18:09,600
it's pretty.
It's pretty evident for the obvious.

415
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,420
You look at them everyday if there,
if one of them is in the um,

416
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:12,860
the,
the,

417
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:16,020
the sandbox where they lay their eggs 
and cheese.

418
00:18:16,021 --> 00:18:21,021
I'm like getting weird when you get near
like a little weird with you and the 

419
00:18:21,021 --> 00:18:22,940
little package a little bit.
Like they're not,

420
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,240
they don't try to hurt you,
but they're like,

421
00:18:24,241 --> 00:18:26,450
get the fuck away from protecting what 
they think is.

422
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:29,700
They think there's a baby in there.
It is,

423
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,290
it is.
But what's the alternative?

424
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:35,670
You got a bunch of Cox in your yard.
Just Jack Trends,

425
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,040
they're all running around.

426
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:41,610
I'd be watching chicken rape but my 
backyard 24 slash seven,

427
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,160
maybe like once in a while,
bring a caulk in to,

428
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,480
you know,
give them a weekend.

429
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:50,130
And so we need his bird birth control.
I don't want these chickens shitting out

430
00:18:50,131 --> 00:18:52,320
kids.
I could bring in a couple of roosters.

431
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,750
I'm willing to make a few adjustments.
This is what I want.

432
00:18:54,751 --> 00:18:57,020
I want sever the roosters.
Vocal cords.

433
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,350
I don't want to hear that shit at 5:00
in the morning.

434
00:19:00,351 --> 00:19:01,650
Yeah,
we know the sun's coming up.

435
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,660
He's shit.
Yeah.

436
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:07,760
Siri told me serious and um,
that would be one.

437
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:11,120
And then uh,
make it so as Dick doesn't work like,

438
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:13,460
like his sperm you like,
uh,

439
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,140
what do you call that?
Yeah,

440
00:19:15,141 --> 00:19:18,450
give them a fix it job.
Just let them bang it out for pleasure.

441
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,880
Yeah,
I'll occasionally,

442
00:19:20,881 --> 00:19:23,760
you'll get one fertile male inch going 
to stick their accounts.

443
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,750
I think a rooster without a voice is not
going to be.

444
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,870
You're going to have a brooding rooster 
on your hands,

445
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,550
you know,
that's going to take what the rooster,

446
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,840
you know,
it's half of it's identity,

447
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,000
man.
Yeah.

448
00:19:33,001 --> 00:19:34,410
What about what a piece of shit?
I am.

449
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:35,430
No,
I'm saying like,

450
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,580
you know,
people who have clipped their dogs vocal

451
00:19:38,581 --> 00:19:40,890
cords because their dogs barks team.
I've heard of that before.

452
00:19:40,891 --> 00:19:42,660
It's fucking crazy,
man.

453
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:47,900
That is,
it is annoying when they bark at you 

454
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:47,900
though.
Sure.

455
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,990
But I wouldn't say try to get chickens 
have the weirdest birth control method 

456
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:51,720
ever.
Oh No.

457
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,600
What is it?
It's got to be a chemical.

458
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:59,840
Chickens have long known to a time a 
Jack Sperm after doing the deep wow.

459
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:03,090
That wasn't well established.
Uh,

460
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:08,120
what wasn't,
was well established was the underlying 

461
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:08,940
reason for what's technically known as 
seminal evacuation.

462
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:12,270
I like how they give us the technical 
term is now I understand it better.

463
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,620
I would prefer it's technically turned,
just call it shooting.

464
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:20,610
Just just the just shot.
But in a recently published paper,

465
00:20:20,611 --> 00:20:23,160
a team led by Oxford researcher,
Rebecca Dean,

466
00:20:23,161 --> 00:20:28,161
explains that this behavior is in fact,
far from random and that the tendency 

467
00:20:28,161 --> 00:20:32,810
for females to jettison Burma's actually
finely tuned mechanism of post Copula 

468
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,050
sexual selection.
Wow.

469
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:38,160
Wow.
That's weird,

470
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:38,910
dude.

471
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,400
That'd be a weird thing to say,
right?

472
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,120
Walk into a chicken,
chicken,

473
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,280
chicken,
check your sperm flirt.

474
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,060
She was

475
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:53,070
a little like,
what would be the like evolutionary 

476
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:53,070
advantage.
Not that you're a biologist,

477
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,850
norma.
We should probably stop there.

478
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:58,270
What would be the evolutionary advantage
of being able to shoot sperm out?

479
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:01,810
You get a vibe from rooster that he's an
asshole.

480
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:08,400
I wasn't consent.
I didn't say yes to that tire is 

481
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:08,400
bullshit.
Yeah.

482
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,600
Who knows.
We're like,

483
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,090
why did he,
why did he take me last?

484
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:13,810
You know what I mean?
Why?

485
00:21:13,811 --> 00:21:15,550
Why did I have to wait for,
for other,

486
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,870
you know,
chickens.

487
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:19,230
I wonder if rooster crows are like,
um,

488
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,890
like those,
that's what it's called,

489
00:21:20,891 --> 00:21:22,990
right?
A crow when they see the guard thing.

490
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:28,010
So I wonder if he's like national 
anthems and that some people nail it and

491
00:21:28,391 --> 00:21:33,391
some people just overdo it.
Some chickens kneel during it like some 

492
00:21:33,631 --> 00:21:35,740
hands,
just like Jesus Christ,

493
00:21:35,741 --> 00:21:35,890
we,

494
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:40,720
you're awake,
you're awake.

495
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:44,780
We get it the first time.

496
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,420
Oh,
see,

497
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
that's the determining factor in when 
you know,

498
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:57,990
like,
uh,

499
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:00,730
Nah,
not supposed to be that long.

500
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:05,760
It's a shorter song then you're doing,
you're doing a totally different song 

501
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,680
doing that.
You're doing a thing with your voice 

502
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:09,680
that can tell you not to do.
Yeah.

503
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:14,611
They loved that 100 percent of the time.
I wish I could do that thing when I 

504
00:22:14,611 --> 00:22:18,610
lived in the East village in New York 
City back like a year or 2000,

505
00:22:18,611 --> 00:22:19,690
1999.
It was,

506
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,300
it was.
It hadn't really been like a,

507
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:27,970
you know,
a neighborhood that was gentrified or 

508
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:27,970
whatever you want to call it at the 
time.

509
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:29,890
And there was a lot of roosters in the 
neighborhood,

510
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:35,260
like these parking lots.
They have these empty lots where there 

511
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:35,680
were no buildings and people just had 
chickens and roosters outside.

512
00:22:35,681 --> 00:22:37,000
So I would,
I was like,

513
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:39,790
I don't know,
22 years old sleeping in my apartment in

514
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,890
the West village and the East village 
rather.

515
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:46,920
And in every morning I'd wake up to a 
rooster crowing like every morning and 

516
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,940
then after a while the community started
hanging these signs like,

517
00:22:48,941 --> 00:22:50,240
are you sick of the roosters?
Like,

518
00:22:50,241 --> 00:22:51,000
and then I was like,
God,

519
00:22:51,001 --> 00:22:52,530
they turned it on the dudes who on the 
roofs,

520
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:58,670
which is not cool because it like those 
guys lived there a long time and have 

521
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:02,350
roosters treated that petitions to get 
rid of the roosters.

522
00:23:02,501 --> 00:23:07,501
Yeah.
All these rooster petitions and then 

523
00:23:07,501 --> 00:23:08,440
over like maybe a year and a half,
two years was no more roosters.

524
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:14,710
One of those like,
like end of an era things in New York 

525
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,690
City where people still had like just 
wandering chickens in an empty lot.

526
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:19,030
It had like could help caps in it and 
chickens.

527
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,880
People don't understand that.
How cool that is.

528
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:24,870
I don't know.
I don't know if it's like this,

529
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,350
it's this weird thing that happens in 
cities where people come in and take all

530
00:23:29,351 --> 00:23:32,540
the culture out of it and then complain 
like,

531
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,120
Oh,
what happened?

532
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,810
All the culture is like,
could you were moved it?

533
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:38,170
You actively came in and removed it?
Well,

534
00:23:38,171 --> 00:23:43,171
there isn't as much of a suburban 
environment so you could have kids in a 

535
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:43,900
minivan and all this stuff you would 
have had in the burbs anyway,

536
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:47,930
and now say that though it a problem 
that it's not like one individual that's

537
00:23:47,931 --> 00:23:51,260
doing it.
It's like a whole movement of economics,

538
00:23:51,261 --> 00:23:52,730
right?
It's a movement of economics.

539
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:57,731
But there is a lot,
in my opinion of sort of community like 

540
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:02,470
activism towards making the community 
the way they envisioned it to be around.

541
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,920
So you end up with a lot of science.
There's like,

542
00:24:03,921 --> 00:24:06,270
we're working on it.
Tomato Co op and you're like,

543
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,780
well,
you know,

544
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:08,610
now it's,
so now you,

545
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:13,690
oh there's tomato cooperate working 
night and got to get in on that and you 

546
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:13,690
know,
and then like,

547
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:14,450
so there's a lot of like,
I'm not saying that things are doing are

548
00:24:14,451 --> 00:24:16,010
bad,
but they're definitely,

549
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,770
you know,
there's,

550
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,690
there's just been a removal of a lot of 
that stuff.

551
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:24,700
And I look,
there's this argument about New York 

552
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:24,700
City that people go,
oh,

553
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:24,700
it used to be better.
You know,

554
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,700
it's like now,
like it was really dangerous.

555
00:24:25,701 --> 00:24:27,760
You better.
But they're.

556
00:24:27,761 --> 00:24:30,080
So there's an up and down to.
It's better unless you were the guy that

557
00:24:30,081 --> 00:24:31,130
got shot.
Exactly.

558
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,190
And then there's the other part,
which is you can.

559
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:39,750
I look at cities like this,
it's like you're always building 

560
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:39,750
something on top of something else that 
was already there.

561
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,900
So what to us is like,
I can't believe that hardware store went

562
00:24:41,901 --> 00:24:42,740
out of business.
It's like,

563
00:24:42,741 --> 00:24:44,180
yeah,
well maybe my grandfather was,

564
00:24:44,181 --> 00:24:45,890
I can't believe they put in a hardware 
store and we're like,

565
00:24:45,891 --> 00:24:49,670
the horseshoe guy used to be like,
oh,

566
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,600
that's really the telegraph guys going 
out with this is bullshit.

567
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,010
You know,
like,

568
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,800
like it's probably something people 
felt,

569
00:24:55,610 --> 00:25:00,610
you know,
anytime you're somewhere first you 

570
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:00,610
always feel like someone's ruining it.

571
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:01,040
Yeah.
I think we're in a very interesting time

572
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:04,880
and,
and in a lot of amazing ways and I think

573
00:25:04,881 --> 00:25:09,170
we're learning more about people and 
behavior I think than ever before.

574
00:25:09,171 --> 00:25:14,171
I think we need to give ourselves a 
little bit of a break in this because I 

575
00:25:14,451 --> 00:25:17,750
think everybody has this feeling like 
why haven't we got our shit together?

576
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:23,020
Why haven't we fully evolved and my take
on this is that this is a really recent 

577
00:25:24,051 --> 00:25:29,051
thing like being aware of what the fuck 
is going on just in general in the 

578
00:25:29,051 --> 00:25:33,590
general scheme of being in the universe 
is a very recent thing.

579
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:38,650
Yup.
And what we know about life and what we 

580
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:39,770
know about,
you know,

581
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:44,771
just our own finite life form,
how far it's going to be able to be 

582
00:25:44,771 --> 00:25:46,850
pushed,
how long we can stay alive,

583
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:47,850
you know,
how,

584
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:52,900
how easy it is to transfer information 
from Australia to China to fucking 

585
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,480
England and back and forth and back and 
forth.

586
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,460
Or we're in the craziest time ever and 
it's all really fucking recent.

587
00:26:01,461 --> 00:26:02,300
Really new.
Yeah.

588
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:07,370
Twenty plus years if that.
Because if you go back 20 years ago the 

589
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:09,440
Internet existed but you couldn't like 
watch a video on it.

590
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:15,050
Like the,
to me the smartphone thing is every day 

591
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:18,460
I'm like,
I can't believe I have this big of my 

592
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,921
pocket.
It's like if you don't remember what it 

593
00:26:20,921 --> 00:26:22,370
was like to like,
you know,

594
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,160
there's this whole like vibe where 
people like millennials don't get it.

595
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:26,360
They're like,
I don't know,

596
00:26:26,361 --> 00:26:31,361
I have the same attention span is a 
millennial because I'm on my phone like 

597
00:26:31,361 --> 00:26:33,230
Deloitte that adults are better,
you know,

598
00:26:33,231 --> 00:26:38,231
and I'm like,
I don't know if I did a US tour in 

599
00:26:38,231 --> 00:26:40,160
Afghanistan a couple of years ago and I 
met all those soldiers,

600
00:26:40,161 --> 00:26:42,620
men and women over there,
and I was like really blown away.

601
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,080
I was like impressed this idea that like
our best days are behind us,

602
00:26:46,081 --> 00:26:47,580
all that stuff and I'm going,
I don't know,

603
00:26:47,581 --> 00:26:50,490
this is a really impressive,
impressive group of young people who are

604
00:26:50,491 --> 00:26:55,491
like fighting for the country,
volunteering to fight for the country 

605
00:26:55,491 --> 00:26:57,130
and like coming back here,
sometimes wounded sometimes you know,

606
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,580
all the things that they risk going 
there.

607
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,680
But then like you meet them and you're 
like,

608
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:03,540
these are like,
they're not like jarheads,

609
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:08,570
you know,
they're like sophisticated thinkers and 

610
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:09,090
they're like trying to like be a part of
something.

611
00:27:09,091 --> 00:27:09,540
It's,
it's.

612
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:12,330
I found it very inspiring to be around 
that.

613
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:13,540
Not like,
oh baby boy,

614
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:16,110
bunch of bunch of losers if millennials 
loser.

615
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,640
So I was like,
she's just awesome.

616
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:19,050
Yeah,
there's,

617
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:23,490
we have a soft life now,
so there's gonna be a lot of people that

618
00:27:23,491 --> 00:27:28,491
are ridiculous and you know,
there's always been those people that 

619
00:27:28,591 --> 00:27:33,591
are weak willed and they want the world 
to be nerved up and of course pad their 

620
00:27:33,591 --> 00:27:33,780
feelings.

621
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:38,890
You're going to have that.
But there's also more people that have 

622
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,890
an understanding of like,
that's not a happy,

623
00:27:40,891 --> 00:27:42,430
healthy way to live your life.
Not.

624
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:47,570
And I also think that like reality at 
some point will always supersede nerf 

625
00:27:48,301 --> 00:27:49,300
padding.
You know,

626
00:27:49,301 --> 00:27:51,720
there's always going to be a push back 
on that where you go look like,

627
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,390
I don't want to offend anybody,
but you know,

628
00:27:54,391 --> 00:27:58,170
and I do agree that there is a movement 
by the left that really does push,

629
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,420
you know,
I did a thing,

630
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,070
reason.
I'm doing this charity event for a,

631
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:08,020
like an urban program for kids.
Um,

632
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,370
mainly inner city black kids.
And I'm hosting with my,

633
00:28:11,371 --> 00:28:16,371
uh,
my buddy Mike Yard is a really funny 

634
00:28:16,371 --> 00:28:18,081
comic black dude.
And we went to meet with the guys for 

635
00:28:18,081 --> 00:28:18,081
this charity and they were telling us 
that,

636
00:28:18,081 --> 00:28:19,230
uh,
you know,

637
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:22,160
were they have an auction like at any 
charity,

638
00:28:22,161 --> 00:28:27,161
then write an auctioneer comes out and 
they'll try to auction off and raise a 

639
00:28:27,161 --> 00:28:27,161
lot of money from rich people to help 
the program.

640
00:28:27,161 --> 00:28:30,960
That's a very basically 99 point nine 
percent of every charity event I've ever

641
00:28:30,961 --> 00:28:32,550
been involved with has an auction 
segment.

642
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:35,160
The in the dinner,
they were like,

643
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:37,710
we're going to have that,
but we can't use the word auction.

644
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,220
I said,
what?

645
00:28:39,221 --> 00:28:41,250
What do you mean you can't use the word 
auction?

646
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:45,030
Don't like it's a sensitive word for,
you know,

647
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,500
the community.
And I was like,

648
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,230
and then the yard goes,
are you talking about slavery?

649
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:52,820
It's like his head almost exploded.
It was like,

650
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:53,560
ah,
wait,

651
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,830
we can't wait.
We can't say the word auction.

652
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:01,160
I'm like,
but aren't you hiring a guy from 

653
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:01,160
southerby's?
Yeah,

654
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:01,160
his card's gonna.
Say Auctioneer on it.

655
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:03,120
We're just going to pretend that's not 
what he's called.

656
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,550
And they were just like,
we just don't feel comfortable with that

657
00:29:05,551 --> 00:29:07,650
word in the room.
And I was just going,

658
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:08,490
I can't see.

659
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,120
I said,
guys,

660
00:29:09,121 --> 00:29:12,150
I gotta tell you it like you're making 
me want to vote for trump.

661
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:15,480
That's what I said.
That's how dumb I think this is.

662
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:20,940
I'm like,
I'll agree to it because I want to help 

663
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,731
these kids.
But this is one of the dumbest things 

664
00:29:22,731 --> 00:29:22,731
I've ever heard.
Wow.

665
00:29:22,731 --> 00:29:22,731
I couldn't believe I was like,
can I say cotton?

666
00:29:22,731 --> 00:29:25,710
Am I allowed to say like,
what other words can I say?

667
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:30,980
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard.
You're going to get triggered auctions 

668
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:35,460
going to make a joke.
Like we're not going to joke around 

669
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:35,460
about like auctioning off a black 
person.

670
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,860
Although yard and I probably would have.
But first of all,

671
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:40,290
like when you say oxygen,
you automatically think of that voice is

672
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:42,890
going to avoid him out of my head when 
I.

673
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:46,120
do you think they did that with when 
they were doing that with slaves?

674
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:49,300
I do not think they talked like that.
I don't know what their technique was,

675
00:29:49,301 --> 00:29:51,190
but I do know when I think of the word 
auction,

676
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:52,240
I'm not like,
Oh,

677
00:29:52,241 --> 00:29:55,480
don't say that.
Don't say the a word,

678
00:29:55,481 --> 00:29:56,280
it's like it's,
it's a,

679
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:59,050
it's a new league.
It's absolutely accepted.

680
00:29:59,051 --> 00:30:00,360
It's a different thing now.
Yeah.

681
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,760
It's like the word gay.
It used to be flintstones gay.

682
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:08,470
Have time.
Having a gay time was like,

683
00:30:08,471 --> 00:30:10,440
we're out having a gay old time.
Yeah.

684
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:13,660
And then it became gay and then you had 
to stop saying it that way,

685
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,140
but just go back to gay happy.
Like Flint.

686
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,340
No you can't,
but you can't.

687
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:20,880
For me growing up was the thing we just 
said about everything.

688
00:30:20,881 --> 00:30:22,210
Almost everything is good.
Doesn't matter.

689
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,760
Like the only thing you couldn't,
you know,

690
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,000
it was terrible.
But when did gay go bad?

691
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:28,630
I don't know.

692
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:31,480
That's a good question.
Went bad after the f word went bad.

693
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,650
Did it?
Yeah.

694
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:35,940
Was it connecting the two of them 
fucking gay and they're like,

695
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:36,510
no,
no,

696
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:41,520
not fucking.
I meant the other word for gay people 

697
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:41,520
that they get to the same fact that.
No,

698
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,730
I'm not afraid to,
but I'm just kind of being sarcastic 

699
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:46,120
with the other f word.
It's like the other white meat.

700
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:46,780
Yeah,
exactly.

701
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:50,530
But like that was the and not that long.
It was,

702
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:53,830
it was this idea of like if something 
was stupid,

703
00:30:53,831 --> 00:30:56,420
it was gay,
like it didn't mean homosexual.

704
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,560
It meant like,
Nah,

705
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,310
don't be so gay.
But then you start thinking about,

706
00:30:59,311 --> 00:31:00,460
oh,
I guess it does.

707
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:05,730
I guess it's offensive because you're 
saying like that stupid shirt you're 

708
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,960
wearing is gay listening.
Of course it's that way,

709
00:31:07,961 --> 00:31:10,810
but isn't it weird that gay took a turn 
for the worst?

710
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:14,890
Wouldn't you have loved to been at the 
intersection when gay went bad?

711
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,420
Like for.
We'll have.

712
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,420
Okay.
Time.

713
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,190
That's gay.
Whoa.

714
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:26,360
What are you saying?
Like a intersection one overran it.

715
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,490
Yep.
The main one beat the happy gay it did.

716
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,560
Gay took that.
They took the word gay and turns it into

717
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:37,190
either a negative like,
oh,

718
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:42,210
that's gay or homosexuality.
How is it not connected to homosexuality

719
00:31:42,641 --> 00:31:44,800
before?
I don't know.

720
00:31:44,801 --> 00:31:47,740
I don't know if the connection came from
the fact that like they're like,

721
00:31:47,741 --> 00:31:50,530
oh those guys are gay.
And they were like being like.

722
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:51,790
Because they were being like,
really?

723
00:31:51,791 --> 00:31:56,791
You know,
like how happy they were like saying 

724
00:31:56,791 --> 00:31:56,791
like,
well that Guy's gay,

725
00:31:56,791 --> 00:31:57,010
Huh?
He's really gay.

726
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,410
Like a gay is with that shiny shirt on,
you know,

727
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:04,440
hey,
that liberace was gay and then maybe 

728
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:04,440
someone was like,
I'll show you the next thing.

729
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:04,870
You know,
people like,

730
00:32:04,871 --> 00:32:06,120
hey,
we gotta we gotta stop.

731
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,380
You know what,
we should stop with that word.

732
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:12,480
Come up with a new word gaze.
A different thing now because I asked 

733
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:12,480
the guy to get gay with me and it got 
really,

734
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:17,190
really uncomfortable.
There had to be like a time in between 

735
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,670
where it was real confusing,
right?

736
00:32:18,671 --> 00:32:20,860
Where they didn't,
hadn't fully establish what it meant yet

737
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,350
where people were like,
hey man,

738
00:32:23,351 --> 00:32:24,760
are you gay?
Yes,

739
00:32:24,761 --> 00:32:27,130
I am gay.
I'm having a gale time.

740
00:32:27,131 --> 00:32:32,131
Guys like good.
And then guy tackles him in the bushes 

741
00:32:32,131 --> 00:32:32,131
like,
uh,

742
00:32:32,131 --> 00:32:34,150
like the word hookup changed.
Yeah.

743
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,130
Like right around like when I was in 
high school,

744
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,360
but like my dad will be like,
Hey,

745
00:32:37,361 --> 00:32:38,710
are you going to hook up with your 
friends tonight?

746
00:32:38,711 --> 00:32:39,430
You know what I what?
I mean,

747
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:44,750
what do you mean it means meet up with 
your friends.

748
00:32:44,751 --> 00:32:45,890
I'm like,
that's not what it means.

749
00:32:45,891 --> 00:32:50,891
You know?
All my buddies would be in the room 

750
00:32:50,891 --> 00:32:50,891
like,
Hey,

751
00:32:50,891 --> 00:32:50,891
you guys can hook up tonight with that.
I'm like,

752
00:32:50,891 --> 00:32:51,130
don't don't it ever was like,
dude,

753
00:32:51,131 --> 00:32:53,200
your dad's gay.

754
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:58,800
Don't be so serious.
So funny.

755
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,660
Yeah.
The language shifts occur.

756
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:05,700
I it feel like right now there's more 
policing of it and there's more people 

757
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:05,700
act.
I don't know.

758
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,380
There's just.
There's a lot like the word pushy was,

759
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:11,120
is one of those where you can say pussy 
anymore.

760
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:16,150
No.
People get offended by it because the 

761
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:16,150
idea is you're getting offended by the 
word,

762
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:16,810
but unless you're overusing it.
No,

763
00:33:16,811 --> 00:33:18,650
no.
I'm saying again,

764
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:21,710
what I say or don't say is what I say or
don't say it.

765
00:33:21,711 --> 00:33:25,340
I take my licks if I have to,
but people get offended by it.

766
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:27,770
You know,
that's a word now that like if you're,

767
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:31,520
if you're in a hardcore leftist 
community,

768
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:36,560
you wouldn't say pushing,
but you'll still say dick guys being a 

769
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:36,560
deck.
It's like,

770
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,960
well that's offensive.
Those communities need a hug.

771
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:44,120
Yeah.
It's like they don't need a hug 

772
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:44,120
actually.

773
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,680
I feel like they need to have too many 
hugs,

774
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:47,570
you know,
and I think there's just too much.

775
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,990
I think it really,
it goes back to our lives are easy now,

776
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:53,480
so we have a lot of free time to come up
with bullshit.

777
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,330
We do.
It's like if we had to actually,

778
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,660
we didn't have electricity or we didn't 
have like all this ease.

779
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:04,690
We wouldn't be harping on this stuff,
but just like you have a lot of 

780
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:05,000
downtime,
a lot of downtime.

781
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:05,360
So you're like,
oh,

782
00:34:05,361 --> 00:34:07,880
I'll start a blog.
I think I'll start blogging about words.

783
00:34:07,881 --> 00:34:12,881
You shouldn't say we have so much 
surplus that one of our biggest problems

784
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:18,110
is that we eat too much food and we get 
to big.

785
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:23,140
Yep.
That's one of the number one health 

786
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,110
problems that humans have.
Like this is how much surplus we have.

787
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:27,140
Even though I know people have it hard 
and there's people that are starving all

788
00:34:27,141 --> 00:34:27,590
over the world.

789
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:30,110
I'm aware,
but just in general,

790
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:32,270
specially in America.
Well,

791
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,780
what is it like one of our number one 
problems is people just eat too much and

792
00:34:35,781 --> 00:34:40,781
when we have the wrong shit about people
starving in America and you think about 

793
00:34:40,781 --> 00:34:43,520
how much food is wasted and thrown out 
for days doing a documentary on it,

794
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,020
there's no,
there's no,

795
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,200
uh,
yeah.

796
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:51,280
It's just such a strange concept that 
there's like no in internal desire to,

797
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:56,770
you know,
it's like why I get annoyed at the 

798
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:56,770
Christian,
right?

799
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:56,770
The like,
oh,

800
00:34:56,770 --> 00:35:00,250
abortions or you're killing babies.
What we need to do is have those babies 

801
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:03,200
and support young mothers who uh,
who support young single moms.

802
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:08,201
I'm like,
when's the last time you fucking 

803
00:35:08,201 --> 00:35:10,400
volunteered to support a young single 
mom who had a baby Christian dude posted

804
00:35:10,401 --> 00:35:15,401
on twitter with the last time you give 
up a Saturday of your day to take that 

805
00:35:15,401 --> 00:35:15,401
kid to the zoo?

806
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:16,850
Bullshit.
You say it,

807
00:35:16,851 --> 00:35:18,320
but they don't fucking do anything about
it.

808
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:23,690
You know,
it's a nice little box to put yourself 

809
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:25,991
in.
For some people they think they're a 

810
00:35:25,991 --> 00:35:25,991
good person because they're a Christian,
but like,

811
00:35:25,991 --> 00:35:26,090
how much?
How much do you really act?

812
00:35:26,091 --> 00:35:27,780
But you're taking your day to stand 
outside.

813
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,770
Planned parenthood was assigned.
Why not take the day to go help that kid

814
00:35:30,771 --> 00:35:34,210
who didn't get aborted and his mom can't
feed him?

815
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,410
Go.
Why not stop by there instead of holding

816
00:35:36,411 --> 00:35:39,930
a sign about the devil?
A clinic for women.

817
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,240
It's just weird.
It is weird.

818
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,270
It's a.
it's,

819
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:45,450
it's a weird thing that you can do it 
too,

820
00:35:45,451 --> 00:35:50,451
right?
I mean that's one of the weird things 

821
00:35:50,451 --> 00:35:52,011
about people is that we know that if we 
don't do anything and we take care of 

822
00:35:52,011 --> 00:35:55,641
ourselves,
a baby's coming and like if you get the 

823
00:35:55,641 --> 00:35:56,160
first countdown,
like countdown,

824
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:59,970
like it's almost like we agree that 
there's like levels to the countdown.

825
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,570
Like in the first couple of days,
no one gives a shit.

826
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,830
Just pull the plug,
pull the plot,

827
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,970
and then every everyone's looking at 
everybody like you feel,

828
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,400
okay,
what happened?

829
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,500
What happened?
Yeah.

830
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,430
It's not that big of a deal.
It's like would we.

831
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,250
How many cells was it?
It was only four cells at the time.

832
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:17,970
Like okay for Salads is not a lot of 
cells and you start thinking,

833
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,990
I don't think it really ever can be for 
sales,

834
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:22,380
but you get my point,
a tiny little thing.

835
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,480
And then when does it become,
when do you decide,

836
00:36:25,481 --> 00:36:28,350
decide that's a person I get.
I get by the way it looks like one,

837
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,830
I don't listen,
I get the argument and you know,

838
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:36,900
I,
I do think that I have my own personal 

839
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,590
philosophy on how I would handle a 
situation,

840
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,900
but I don't if you were a woman.

841
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:40,500
No,
no,

842
00:36:40,501 --> 00:36:45,501
no.
I'm saying if I was in a relationship 

843
00:36:45,501 --> 00:36:47,121
with a woman and she got pregnant and 
didn't want to have the kid or didn't 

844
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:47,121
want to have the at night,
you know,

845
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:50,930
at the end of the day we'd have a 
conversation together and if she was 

846
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:50,930
dead set on doing it then we're going to
do it,

847
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:51,570
you know,
because that.

848
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:52,950
But,
but my point being,

849
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:58,190
I do believe that like it's a weird 
thing to just tell other people what 

850
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:58,190
they're supposed to do or not.
I do.

851
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:00,450
I feel about gay marriage.
I feel that way about everything.

852
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:01,200
It's like,
it's,

853
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:05,580
it's a strange thing to be able to 
dictate to someone else how they,

854
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:10,770
they're supposed to live.
Agreed because there's too many people 

855
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:13,410
there with that man.
Like we got the right doing it through 

856
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:13,410
the Christian,
right.

857
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:13,410
And we've got the left doing it through,
you know,

858
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:14,430
all their,
all their movements.

859
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:19,430
And it's like,
I think the reason most people are so 

860
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:19,430
annoyed in the country isn't like even 
political.

861
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:20,910
It's like they're just sick of people 
telling them how to live,

862
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:22,200
you know?
It's like I get it.

863
00:37:22,201 --> 00:37:23,190
I can't say that,
oh,

864
00:37:23,191 --> 00:37:25,450
you want me to not have a gun?
You hate guns.

865
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:29,190
It's like everyone's fucking stopper.
It's like we need like a,

866
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:34,660
just like a national time out for five 
minutes and we're just learning how to 

867
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:34,660
use this thing,
man,

868
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:39,070
where we're learning how to integrate 
society into this kind of communication 

869
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,410
that we share right now.
Just while we're still figuring it out.

870
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:45,450
I did talk about that with somebody the 
other day and I was actually just doing 

871
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:46,770
a set on stage and I was riffing a 
little bit about how,

872
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:52,070
you know,
we talked about the second amendment a 

873
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,310
lot and the founding fathers didn't know
we were gonna have assault rifles.

874
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:58,310
They didn't have the foresight to see 
that so that we have to rethink what 

875
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:58,310
that means and it's like,
well,

876
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:58,350
they didn't know we were going to have 
twitter.

877
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:03,750
Right,
so maybe we have to rethink what the 

878
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,601
first amendment means that no every 
fucking moron who's going to have the 

879
00:38:05,601 --> 00:38:07,140
ability to you say stuff out loud,
just on a national level,

880
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,490
just the Internet.
I mean,

881
00:38:08,491 --> 00:38:11,340
imagine how easy it was to govern people
before the Internet came around.

882
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:13,680
It must have been so much easier to just
lie to them,

883
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:17,340
lie to them to have almost no access to 
the truth and what you get.

884
00:38:17,341 --> 00:38:19,230
We get with Walter cronkite tells you,
bitch,

885
00:38:19,231 --> 00:38:20,490
that's all you get.
What'd you get?

886
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:22,650
It's like,
it's like the entertainment industry.

887
00:38:22,651 --> 00:38:24,300
It used to be like,
you want to hear a song?

888
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,430
Merv Griffin and Dick Clark will let you
know what song was.

889
00:38:26,431 --> 00:38:27,060
It can hear,
you know,

890
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,150
we're on the side of the people that are
anti abortion.

891
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:33,720
There's one side of you that has to 
logically interpret that.

892
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:36,550
If these people really did feel like 
babies

893
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:41,550
were being murdered,
like it was their perspective that 

894
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:44,400
babies were being murdered.
If you completely ignore that 

895
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,040
perspective and just try to say it's a 
woman's health issue like I get,

896
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:53,240
I almost get where their mind is at.
I don't think that they should be 

897
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,660
interfering in anybody's life,
especially when something is illegal and

898
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:02,520
fundamentally believe that's what's 
happening and you could see how that 

899
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:02,520
thought babies were being killed up to 
street.

900
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:04,990
We can't allow this to happen,
but what I'm saying,

901
00:39:04,991 --> 00:39:09,991
I'll tell you that they are babies and 
the problem with that argument is it's.

902
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,890
It holds some water.
Sure.

903
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Like you really have to me as if you're 
going to be a rational person and I'm 

904
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,680
100 percent pro choice,
but as a rational person,

905
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:20,920
you have to look at what it actually is.
If you don't,

906
00:39:20,921 --> 00:39:22,210
well then we're playing a game.

907
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,060
The game is you want your side to be 
correct,

908
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:28,540
but the reality is this is a very 
complicated,

909
00:39:28,541 --> 00:39:29,750
weird thing.
Yeah,

910
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:34,830
there's like a life in your body and for
sure a guy shouldn't be able to tell 

911
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:34,830
girl,
which you can do.

912
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,010
Totally agree with that can't.
You can't tell a woman.

913
00:39:36,011 --> 00:39:38,320
She has to keep it.
People have already aborted babies.

914
00:39:38,321 --> 00:39:43,321
There's a precedent for it.
You can't tell them what they could do 

915
00:39:43,321 --> 00:39:43,321
or you can do to support their decision 
or can weigh in.

916
00:39:43,321 --> 00:39:45,370
I think if you're the dad you can weigh 
in and what you want,

917
00:39:45,371 --> 00:39:48,370
but at the end of the day she's going to
decide what she wants to do and you just

918
00:39:48,371 --> 00:39:49,690
got to agree with it.
Yeah,

919
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,660
and that's the move.
I think you know,

920
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:57,310
it's just,
it's a very complicated thing,

921
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:02,520
but like a life form that will 
eventually become a person is inside 

922
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:02,520
your body.

923
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:07,350
What do you do?
Like you imagine we had to make that 

924
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:08,290
decision.
We're lucky that chicks do it because we

925
00:40:08,291 --> 00:40:10,740
don't think correctly for that,
for that proposition.

926
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:13,990
Now ability to weigh those options,
but I do think that the,

927
00:40:13,991 --> 00:40:15,130
uh,
the,

928
00:40:15,131 --> 00:40:15,490
you know,
the,

929
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:18,040
when I think about that,
I agree with you and I,

930
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:23,090
and I think most issues in the country 
are like that and that's the whole 

931
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:23,090
problem.
There's no rationality on either side,

932
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:23,920
right?
There's no,

933
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:25,570
no one will.
Rational Center,

934
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,350
right?
Like for example,

935
00:40:26,351 --> 00:40:27,970
people will,
you know,

936
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:33,030
look,
there's a lot going on with trump and 

937
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:33,030
Russia and all that stuff.
Wait,

938
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:33,080
what have you heard?
And then,

939
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,880
and then people will post them thing.
Yeah.

940
00:40:35,881 --> 00:40:37,840
Well,
about Obama scandals and then someone on

941
00:40:37,841 --> 00:40:38,310
the left,
the building,

942
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:40,740
he had no scandals and then someone will
list like five scanners.

943
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:41,290
They go,
yeah,

944
00:40:41,291 --> 00:40:42,340
those were scandals.

945
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:45,100
Like you can't just pretend that like 
that fast.

946
00:40:45,101 --> 00:40:47,920
And the furious thing was good.
It was bad.

947
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:50,620
Like if you really like muscle cars,
like,

948
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:51,620
no,
but you know,

949
00:40:51,621 --> 00:40:53,320
that Obama thing where he like,
oh,

950
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:58,420
that's where you gave all the guns.
They lost all those guns and some of 

951
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:58,970
them were used to kill people.
Yeah.

952
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:00,250
So it's like,
I don't know,

953
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:02,530
like that.
What was the logic behind that?

954
00:41:02,531 --> 00:41:05,050
They were going to trace them to like 
Iran contra account.

955
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,760
Did you see that movie by the way,
scam?

956
00:41:06,761 --> 00:41:10,600
Or was it a thing where they were trying
to give them guns that they could trace,

957
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:14,920
they could trace and then they instantly
can trace because I think that was.

958
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,380
I think that was the gist of it.
Can you imagine that?

959
00:41:17,381 --> 00:41:19,450
That was just really a gun.
I mean this is.

960
00:41:19,451 --> 00:41:22,780
Some people do think it was like a just 
an illegal arms sale that happened right

961
00:41:22,781 --> 00:41:27,781
under our nose.
Will you imagine if that's really what 

962
00:41:27,781 --> 00:41:27,781
it is?
I mean,

963
00:41:27,781 --> 00:41:30,841
did you watch that?
I just watched it the other night that 

964
00:41:30,841 --> 00:41:30,841
Tom Cruise movie American made.
No,

965
00:41:30,841 --> 00:41:30,940
I did not,
but I know what it's about.

966
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:34,100
It's the first good Tom cruise movie 
he's

967
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:39,100
had out I think in a couple of years.
Like it's funny because he's that kind 

968
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:39,100
of a dark character is not like a hero.
He says,

969
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:42,750
I know at Barry Seal story,
so he's,

970
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:44,240
you know,
he's a,

971
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:47,550
like a pilot who basically like,
you know,

972
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:48,980
the CIA was like,
hey,

973
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:52,580
you're a really good pilot and we need a
guy to like bring some guns to the,

974
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:56,300
it's all the precursor,
the Iran Contra thing,

975
00:41:56,301 --> 00:41:57,920
which as a kid I remember hearing all 
about,

976
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:00,130
but then understanding of the federal 
level,

977
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:02,420
which was us trying to arm rebels,
which we've been doing for,

978
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,520
we are been loud and against the 
Russians.

979
00:42:04,521 --> 00:42:06,020
We've been arming rebels for a long 
time.

980
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:06,890
And that's our move,
right?

981
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:08,410
Yeah.
Big Time Gang.

982
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:09,080
Yeah.
And then,

983
00:42:09,081 --> 00:42:10,760
uh,
so he became the dude,

984
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:12,800
the CIA asked to do that and he was 
like,

985
00:42:12,801 --> 00:42:14,360
you got to pay me more money.
And the guy was like,

986
00:42:14,361 --> 00:42:15,170
you'll figure it out.

987
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:17,450
And then all of a sudden it became,
he would land the,

988
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:18,470
bring the guns.
And the dude was like,

989
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:21,200
Hey,
we want you to bring an escobar.

990
00:42:21,201 --> 00:42:23,030
And his crew were like,
Pablo Escobar,

991
00:42:23,031 --> 00:42:23,690
we're like,
hey,

992
00:42:23,691 --> 00:42:28,691
as long as you're bringing us guns,
we also want you on your flight home to 

993
00:42:28,691 --> 00:42:31,661
bring a 1500 pounds of cocaine.
And then he was like,

994
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:34,130
I'm not going to do that.
No thanks.

995
00:42:34,131 --> 00:42:37,550
And they were like a 2000,
2000 bucks a kilo.

996
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:39,250
And he was like,
how many kilos at 50?

997
00:42:39,251 --> 00:42:40,810
Fifteen hundred pounds.
It became like,

998
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:46,750
it became like this insane to wait 
smugglers smuggling guns in and drugs 

999
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:48,350
and guns and drugs.
It's a really interesting story.

1000
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:53,380
What do you think happens today?
Do you think that stuff like that is 

1001
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:54,610
still going on today?
Or do you think that this,

1002
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:59,680
when it happened,
like they figured out that it was a 

1003
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,340
bunch of cowboys,
like ca operatives that were just trying

1004
00:43:01,341 --> 00:43:02,450
to make some money on the side?

1005
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:05,420
Or do you think it's like a systematic?
I think that it's like.

1006
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:08,720
I think that it's human error.
I think that like people,

1007
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,830
that's why I'm not like a big conspiracy
theorist because it's like I don't think

1008
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:18,430
the government's organized enough.
It's always weird to me when people who 

1009
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:19,340
think that government sucks,
who wants small government,

1010
00:43:19,341 --> 00:43:22,190
they want the government,
the government mishandles everything.

1011
00:43:22,191 --> 00:43:23,790
They don't know how to do this.
They don't know how to do this.

1012
00:43:23,791 --> 00:43:27,140
They can't magic imagine manage traffic 
lights,

1013
00:43:27,141 --> 00:43:28,520
whatever they think the government can't
do.

1014
00:43:28,521 --> 00:43:30,320
They can't do healthcare.
They're idiots.

1015
00:43:30,321 --> 00:43:32,000
They're idiots.
Private sector and then they're like,

1016
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:37,330
but there's a giant government 
conspiracy where all the government 

1017
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:39,941
knows this thing and I'm like,
if they can't fucking manage traffic 

1018
00:43:39,941 --> 00:43:43,241
lights,
how are they pulling off like a fake 

1019
00:43:43,241 --> 00:43:43,450
moon landing or whatever.
It's like,

1020
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:44,840
well,
when you that kind of stuff,

1021
00:43:44,841 --> 00:43:45,730
to me it's like you're,
you're,

1022
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:49,320
you're perpetuating two very different 
views of it.

1023
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:54,320
Extremely competent,
clandestine and group of people who can 

1024
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:56,951
achieve these like dark shadow.
We things without anyone knowing or 

1025
00:43:56,951 --> 00:43:57,920
bumbling morons,
but they're the same people.

1026
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:00,210
They're government workers.
So I don't know.

1027
00:44:00,211 --> 00:44:04,070
I think some CIS or like the story 
behind going into Iraq is interesting.

1028
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:08,770
Like a CIA operative had a theory about 
what we're been.

1029
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:13,340
Osama fucking other dudes so download.
Saddam Hussein had a,

1030
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:17,360
had weapons of mass destruction.
He had a theory and he was an analyst at

1031
00:44:17,361 --> 00:44:21,470
the CIA and he wrote up this whole 
document and they read it.

1032
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:22,070
They were like,
yeah,

1033
00:44:22,071 --> 00:44:23,900
this is bullshit.
Like we have no proof of any of this.

1034
00:44:23,901 --> 00:44:25,880
Thank you.
And he was so mad they did that,

1035
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:30,910
that he published it on the Internet,
just leaked it to the Internet and then 

1036
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:34,560
that story got on the Internet and then 
the dude in Australia who was a spy.

1037
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:39,590
No,
we're like a guy from Australia and 

1038
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:41,670
another guy from Afghanistan or Iraq 
read it on the Internet,

1039
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:46,910
came to America and said,
I have all the secrets of what he's 

1040
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:50,331
doing,
and he just used that guy's document 

1041
00:44:50,331 --> 00:44:52,980
that he read online and told the CIA and
then the guy came in and goes,

1042
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:54,410
he has weapons here,
weapons here,

1043
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:56,250
weapons here,
and then that analyst goes,

1044
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,720
Holy Shit.
I was right.

1045
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,120
Meanwhile he's quoting him his own 
report,

1046
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:02,130
so then he goes back to Cheyney and he 
goes,

1047
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:07,220
we've got this dude talking to the 
Germans saying all the things I 

1048
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:08,140
theorized and then that's the guy curve 
ball.

1049
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:13,340
We listen to a dude named curveball.
So like that's how the whole fucking 

1050
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:15,660
thing went down and basically some do 
tricked us.

1051
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:18,180
He actually didn't know anything but it 
was too late.

1052
00:45:18,181 --> 00:45:23,181
We like went off the information that a 
dude read off the Internet from a guy 

1053
00:45:23,181 --> 00:45:23,181
who was mad.

1054
00:45:23,181 --> 00:45:24,840
They wouldn't take his info,
which was wrong,

1055
00:45:24,841 --> 00:45:26,630
which is why there were no weapons of 
mass destruction.

1056
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,890
So crazy.
So it's just a crazy.

1057
00:45:28,891 --> 00:45:30,510
So yeah,
I think that shit happens all the time,

1058
00:45:30,511 --> 00:45:33,330
but I don't think it's,
I just think they're sloppy.

1059
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:38,660
Government employee are dealing with a 
bunch of different things for some of 

1060
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:39,990
them are sloppy government employees.
Some of them are not.

1061
00:45:39,991 --> 00:45:42,570
Some of them are brilliant.
I mean there's that too.

1062
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,150
Like Robert Muller's,
there's A.

1063
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:45,540
Yeah,
there's a ton of them.

1064
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:47,160
There's a ton of them that are 
brilliant,

1065
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:52,580
but you're also going to have cowboys.
And this is what I think when you find 

1066
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:54,770
out about these CIA drug deals gone bad.
Where did you see that one?

1067
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:57,690
Where the plane crashed in Mexico.
They wouldn't let them refuel.

1068
00:45:57,691 --> 00:46:02,691
They wouldn't let them land refuel 
because they kind of knew maybe they 

1069
00:46:02,691 --> 00:46:06,201
were smuggling drugs and they made him 
crash and the plane wound up crashing 

1070
00:46:06,201 --> 00:46:07,710
and it had how many tons of cocaine did 
it have in it,

1071
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:10,290
and people like,
this is proof the CIA sells cocaine.

1072
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:11,310
I'm like,
no,

1073
00:46:11,311 --> 00:46:14,370
it's proved those guys flying.
That plane had cocaine.

1074
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:19,400
Right.
The real question is did they just get 

1075
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,351
too Loosey Goosey?
Traveling back and forth to South 

1076
00:46:21,351 --> 00:46:21,351
America,
a little too tight with some people that

1077
00:46:21,351 --> 00:46:25,791
have had a little bit too much money and
they realized we could fucking do this 

1078
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:25,830
so we could do this and no one would 
suspect it.

1079
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:26,850
Well,
that's the thing though.

1080
00:46:26,851 --> 00:46:31,851
Say what the what the five point five 
tons of five point five tons.

1081
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:35,370
Wow.
Isn't that 11 pounds 11.

1082
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:37,020
How many?
How many thousand pounds?

1083
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:38,800
11,000?
Yeah.

1084
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,800
Two Thousand Times.
Five and a half.

1085
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:41,700
Is that what it is?
Yeah.

1086
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:45,330
And 11,000
pounds of fucking cocaine.

1087
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:46,320
Dude.
I tell you,

1088
00:46:46,321 --> 00:46:51,321
it's insane,
but show the pictures of the crash 

1089
00:46:51,321 --> 00:46:51,321
because it's crazy.
There's just six of coke,

1090
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:53,130
man.
I want to say like 2005,

1091
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:54,240
six,
six,

1092
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:57,150
but so the but the barry seal story,
was he just a pilot,

1093
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:59,980
a CIA operative who's trying to make 
connections with them,

1094
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:02,400
do his mission,
which is given to him,

1095
00:47:02,401 --> 00:47:04,350
which is arm these rebels.

1096
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:08,280
So five guys in the CIA have to try to 
figure out how to arm rebels.

1097
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:13,310
So he approaches this pilot that he 
hears is a good pilot who flies for Twa 

1098
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:13,310
and he goes,
hey man,

1099
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:16,380
you're now in the CIA,
but he's not really in the CIA.

1100
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:19,680
He's not part of this age.
Just a pilot that this guy subcontracts.

1101
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:22,830
And then he doesn't tell the bosses how 
he's getting the guns in.

1102
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,810
So it's.
He just made up a little thing.

1103
00:47:24,811 --> 00:47:28,680
He has his own budget to do his own 
little thing and he finds this dude.

1104
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,080
So it's not like barry seal was

1105
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:35,140
a CIA guy flying cocaine.
He was just a pilot that the CIA told 

1106
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:38,830
and only one guy from the CIA told it to
him and then it's crazy story,

1107
00:47:38,831 --> 00:47:43,831
you know?
And then he's doing it and then he 

1108
00:47:43,831 --> 00:47:43,831
starts making his little side business.
And this guy looks the other way because

1109
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:47,950
he just wants buried delivering the guns
and then after a while,

1110
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:49,310
like as it starts to fall apart,
the,

1111
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:52,000
so it's like burn everything with Barry 
Seal's name on it.

1112
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:55,620
We've never had.
We've never had connection to barry seal

1113
00:47:55,630 --> 00:47:56,620
and entire life.
And that's,

1114
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:00,430
that's all the coke that they got off.
That plane looks like.

1115
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:05,440
What size was that for an army.
Like if you had like a army troop and 

1116
00:48:06,851 --> 00:48:11,851
like boys,
this is your career and it's all rolled 

1117
00:48:11,851 --> 00:48:14,701
up in these giant bags.
Is it if so funny though that like that 

1118
00:48:14,701 --> 00:48:14,701
is crazy.

1119
00:48:14,701 --> 00:48:16,330
People still think a wall is going to 
work.

1120
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,120
It's like drugs were coming in on an 
airplane.

1121
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:24,330
Well,
just the fact that the airplane was a 

1122
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:24,790
cia or playing,
did they have in the movie,

1123
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:27,060
did they have the reason why they,
uh,

1124
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:29,470
the whole scheme got busted in the first
place?

1125
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:30,700
Do you know the story?
Yeah,

1126
00:48:30,701 --> 00:48:35,701
I mean,
I don't know if it like a spoiler for 

1127
00:48:35,701 --> 00:48:37,231
listeners,
but I'll tell you the real story about 

1128
00:48:37,231 --> 00:48:37,231
the kids that were murdered.
Uh,

1129
00:48:37,231 --> 00:48:38,470
the kids that were murdered were,
that wasn't in the movie?

1130
00:48:38,471 --> 00:48:39,470
I don't think so.
The,

1131
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:44,540
one of the ways this whole thing came 
apart was two kids were apparently in 

1132
00:48:45,041 --> 00:48:50,041
the woods when they made a drop and 
these kids saw a drop and they were 

1133
00:48:50,041 --> 00:48:54,631
murdered.
They were stabbed and then they lead 

1134
00:48:54,631 --> 00:48:56,940
left their bodies on the train tracks 
and their bodies were run over by train 

1135
00:48:56,940 --> 00:49:00,571
tracks and then the parents got an 
autopsy and the autopsy showed that at 

1136
00:49:00,571 --> 00:49:01,450
least one of the kids had been stabbed.

1137
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:06,690
Wow.
And so something I realized something 

1138
00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:08,230
had happened in New Orleans where the 
kids got killed.

1139
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:09,370
No,
it was MENA,

1140
00:49:09,371 --> 00:49:10,340
Arkansas.
Okay.

1141
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:12,390
That's the main part of it.
Yeah.

1142
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:15,460
That's where the drop was.
The drop was apparently in Mena,

1143
00:49:15,461 --> 00:49:20,461
Arkansas.
So they killed these kids and then this 

1144
00:49:20,461 --> 00:49:21,400
whole thing happened and then the whole 
thing fell apart and then people started

1145
00:49:21,401 --> 00:49:26,401
looking into it and then barry seal's 
was murdered actually as he was getting 

1146
00:49:26,401 --> 00:49:26,650
to court to testify.
Well,

1147
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:27,160
he,
yeah,

1148
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,370
he says amazing thriller,
like a Tom Clancy novel.

1149
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:33,490
It's a really good and it's done well.
The movie's done well.

1150
00:49:33,491 --> 00:49:35,890
And uh,
but they don't mention the murdered kid,

1151
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:40,950
but they skipped the Mena.
Arkansas is the place where they cia 

1152
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:43,090
moves in and then um,
I hope I'm not remembering this wrong,

1153
00:49:43,091 --> 00:49:45,130
but I think that was the reason why they
got busted.

1154
00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:50,370
I could be,
I'm saying in the movie that's not 

1155
00:49:50,370 --> 00:49:50,470
mentioned,
creative license,

1156
00:49:50,471 --> 00:49:51,370
that making a movie,
they're like,

1157
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:53,110
oh man,
I hate when they do that.

1158
00:49:53,111 --> 00:49:54,280
Yeah.
I hate when they do that,

1159
00:49:54,281 --> 00:49:57,010
when it's a real life situation.
Like there's a.

1160
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:02,160
Did you ever see that wrestling movie 
with Steve Carell fuck out called the 

1161
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:02,160
wrestler?
No,

1162
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:02,160
no,
no.

1163
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:06,280
I'm with Steve Carell and Steve.
He's the dupont guy.

1164
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:07,320
John Depaul.
Ah,

1165
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:08,770
fuck.
What's the name of that movie?

1166
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,110
Foxcatcher.
Foxcatcher never would have gone there.

1167
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:18,660
Yeah,
that they did that in that movie where 

1168
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:19,450
they cut out key details.
Yeah,

1169
00:50:19,451 --> 00:50:23,720
well they changed a big part of the 
ending where Mark Schultz it like this.

1170
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:28,160
It's a UFC fight.
A famous UFC fight were mark Schultz

1171
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,170
who is just top of the food chain 
wrestler,

1172
00:50:30,171 --> 00:50:35,171
fought this guy,
big daddy goodrich who's a really well 

1173
00:50:35,171 --> 00:50:37,901
known MMA guy.
Just totally dominated them and in the 

1174
00:50:37,901 --> 00:50:40,970
movie he's fighting some white guy to 
just some made up guy.

1175
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:46,030
They just changed it.
It's just changed that they maybe not 

1176
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:48,041
get the rights to the name or it doesn't
matter then don't have that to take it 

1177
00:50:48,411 --> 00:50:50,540
out.
I know what the fuck the history of this

1178
00:50:50,541 --> 00:50:55,541
was.
Now if you lie to me about something so 

1179
00:50:55,541 --> 00:50:58,060
insignificant as who the guy was that he
fought in the UFC,

1180
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:00,740
he takes it out of it.
What else are you lying about?

1181
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:02,630
A great,
but it's just so stupid to do.

1182
00:51:02,631 --> 00:51:07,631
It's a real story.
Did you ever see that movie with Marky 

1183
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:09,170
Mark and the rock?
I'm serious.

1184
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:09,820
I should.
That column.

1185
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:11,280
Marky mark.
Um,

1186
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:12,290
I think it's marketing.

1187
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:16,760
Mark Wahlberg and the rock and it's like
it's a true based on a true story.

1188
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:18,680
It came out like two,
three years ago.

1189
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:21,920
It's really good and in the middle of 
the movie it's one of the coolest things

1190
00:51:21,921 --> 00:51:24,050
I've ever seen done in a true story 
movie.

1191
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:29,410
They're like doing this absurd thing or 
like jumping off a rooftop together and 

1192
00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:31,430
it just pauses and then a text comes up 
and says,

1193
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:34,550
this all happened.
This is still a true story.

1194
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:36,920
Like it reminds you in the middle of the
movie,

1195
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:39,320
pain and gain was oh,
pain and gain.

1196
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:40,460
Yeah.
Fun.

1197
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:41,840
Moving in.
Dump or something.

1198
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:44,150
I knew it was something like that.
Is this the part?

1199
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:46,520
Just the trailer.
The trailer.

1200
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:49,100
Did this a fun movie?
It's a great movie.

1201
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:49,710
Yeah.
Honestly,

1202
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:53,060
my favorite movies that he did.
It's fun ass movie.

1203
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:54,680
Yep.
The rocks.

1204
00:51:54,681 --> 00:51:55,670
Good man.
I liked the rock.

1205
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:59,330
I love the Rock in the middle of the,
in the middle of the movie,

1206
00:51:59,331 --> 00:52:00,590
they.
They pause it and they go.

1207
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:03,170
This is still a true story like this 
happen,

1208
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:08,380
which is cool because it like.
Because it gets almost inconceivable 

1209
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:11,681
after awhile.
I think the rock is going to be our 

1210
00:52:11,681 --> 00:52:13,451
president.
I think the rock should be our 

1211
00:52:13,451 --> 00:52:14,861
president.
I think he can pull it off and I'm not 

1212
00:52:14,861 --> 00:52:14,861
joking.
I'm not joking either,

1213
00:52:14,861 --> 00:52:19,211
man.
I would never in a serious political 

1214
00:52:19,211 --> 00:52:21,461
discussion in good hands with my 
patients for real politics has waned it.

1215
00:52:22,571 --> 00:52:22,910
Look,
we're,

1216
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,800
we're on our way there.
You've seen idiocracy,

1217
00:52:24,801 --> 00:52:25,640
right?
We're on our way,

1218
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:27,460
dude.
I still haven't seen that.

1219
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,180
Oh Wow.
You will love that movie.

1220
00:52:29,181 --> 00:52:29,820
I know.
I would.

1221
00:52:29,950 --> 00:52:34,950
I,
I got salty because when I had a bit 

1222
00:52:34,950 --> 00:52:36,160
that was the same premise of that is 
about dumb people out.

1223
00:52:36,161 --> 00:52:37,140
Fucking all the smart people.

1224
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,810
One day we wake up and uh,
all the power's off and uh,

1225
00:52:40,890 --> 00:52:42,440
you know,
no one knows how to turn it back on.

1226
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:47,470
That would,
that would annoy me too if it was your 

1227
00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:49,580
bed because it's not my bit.
They stole the parallel thinking.

1228
00:52:49,581 --> 00:52:52,590
So it's an obvious concept if you think 
that people are out,

1229
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:55,490
if they think that people are getting 
dumber and dumber,

1230
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:57,630
people are having more kids.
It's just,

1231
00:52:57,710 --> 00:52:58,800
it's inevitable.
Yeah,

1232
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:00,350
they are.
Yeah.

1233
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:02,540
That's very true.
And I traced it back to the pyramid,

1234
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,720
like the whole,
the whole thing was like that.

1235
00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:07,500
The smart people just died.
And then the one that had done,

1236
00:53:07,501 --> 00:53:09,560
people showed up at the pyramid and then
they just moved in.

1237
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:16,380
Nobody lives here.
Like the alien culture created exactly 

1238
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:17,090
that.
A bunch of like fat dudes look good.

1239
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:18,590
Yeah.
The idiot workers,

1240
00:53:18,591 --> 00:53:23,591
if you just stumbled into it.
We built this whole generation to go 

1241
00:53:23,591 --> 00:53:26,130
with the best that's.
So that's still,

1242
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:31,130
to me,
if I had one time in like if you could 

1243
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:33,000
go back in a time machine and go to one 
place in history and see something,

1244
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:36,240
I think it would have to be Egypt while 
they were building the pyramids.

1245
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:39,150
I would just love to see what that 
culture was like.

1246
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:44,160
It's so hard to tell.
I mean you look at all the stone and 

1247
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:44,160
everything,
right?

1248
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:44,580
Even if you were standing there automat 
I've never been to Egypt,

1249
00:53:44,581 --> 00:53:46,570
but I've been to cheat.
She needs on.

1250
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:48,540
It's kind of the same feeling you get.
Were you like,

1251
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:50,130
what was it like,
like when,

1252
00:53:50,131 --> 00:53:51,890
when this place was popping,
like,

1253
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,280
what did this feel like?
What was this?

1254
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:58,490
These people have built these crazy 
structures like what was a normal day 

1255
00:53:58,490 --> 00:53:58,490
for them?
You know,

1256
00:53:58,490 --> 00:53:58,790
it's funny,
I had the,

1257
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:04,160
I didn't realize that.
I've watched the documentary about the 

1258
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:04,160
Pyramids and not the,
uh,

1259
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:08,790
not the one with the aliens and which 
one Nazis and what,

1260
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:09,200
what,
what,

1261
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:09,870
what's that one on?

1262
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:12,990
Like with the guy with the crazy hair.
Oh,

1263
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:18,710
and it George Hill.
Shout out to Giorgio sucralose and he's 

1264
00:54:18,710 --> 00:54:20,730
like ancient astronauts theorists 
surmise.

1265
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:25,770
Tell people that's not a sentence.
Know he's fairly reasonable.

1266
00:54:25,771 --> 00:54:29,730
When you talk to Georgiou is just a 
lover of all possibilities.

1267
00:54:29,731 --> 00:54:31,920
Ufo.
That's an hour's worth of a show.

1268
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,770
They're on like season 11,
89.

1269
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:36,590
There was camping out.
You know,

1270
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:39,000
it's not the first one with like the 
Nazca lines.

1271
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:44,240
It's pretty interesting.
But now they're like eight inch an 

1272
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,090
astronaut feared semis,
that palm trees,

1273
00:54:45,091 --> 00:54:46,260
what brought here.
But in you're like,

1274
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:47,310
just stop.
Like,

1275
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:48,870
listen man,
you finished it.

1276
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:53,930
If ghost shows are still on the air,
let them be on the air because at least 

1277
00:54:53,930 --> 00:54:57,561
they're showing cool old buildings and 
shit and stone structures ever be 

1278
00:54:57,561 --> 00:55:01,590
possible.
They have a family wanting to go to 

1279
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:01,590
this.
That one ghost man,

1280
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:04,110
at least we have some cool rocks to look
at where you look at like,

1281
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:06,960
you know,
what are those giant stones in?

1282
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,180
Is it Peru?
Stonehenge?

1283
00:55:09,210 --> 00:55:09,580
No,
no,

1284
00:55:09,581 --> 00:55:09,840
no,
no,

1285
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:14,860
no.
I'm still interested in England and in 

1286
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:14,860
England.
Yeah,

1287
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:16,830
there's some.
There's some crazy structures somewhere 

1288
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:21,050
in south America that Giorgio was 
talking to us about and it was one of 

1289
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:26,001
the reasons why some people speculate 
that it's possible that some of the 

1290
00:55:26,001 --> 00:55:30,081
things that are constructed that we 
really don't have any idea how ancient 

1291
00:55:30,081 --> 00:55:30,870
primitive man did were actually 
constructed by someone from another.

1292
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:36,110
Another plan,
which I don't think it's any less 

1293
00:55:36,110 --> 00:55:39,081
reasonable than people thinking.
God sent like pointed his finger 

1294
00:55:39,081 --> 00:55:40,080
giraffe.
You're right about that.

1295
00:55:40,081 --> 00:55:43,170
You're right about that.
Like half the world believes that you're

1296
00:55:43,171 --> 00:55:48,171
right about that,
but it's more reasonable to think that 

1297
00:55:48,171 --> 00:55:50,391
it was done by people because we know 
people are a real thing and we know 

1298
00:55:50,391 --> 00:55:51,470
people have built a lot of shit.
So the.

1299
00:55:51,471 --> 00:55:52,290
Yeah,
this is it.

1300
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:54,870
This is the exact structure.
These fucking stones there,

1301
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:57,780
they're not just cut and placed 
perfectly,

1302
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:03,080
but they're in fit together like a 
jigsaw puzzle and somehow or another 

1303
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:08,031
they carved and move these enormous 
stones and if you stand right next to 

1304
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:08,031
them,
like a,

1305
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:11,010
there's some photos of people standing 
next to him stand right next to him.

1306
00:56:11,011 --> 00:56:14,730
Apparently they just tower over people.
So these were all done,

1307
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:19,760
you know,
who knows how many thousands of years 

1308
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,370
ago.
But it isn't there like a reasonable 

1309
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:23,380
thing to think that maybe they had 
technology that is lost to time.

1310
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:28,410
Yeah,
that's a reasonable thing to think for 

1311
00:56:28,410 --> 00:56:28,410
sure.
Like in other words,

1312
00:56:28,410 --> 00:56:31,040
like if our civilization crumbles and in
2000 years people dig it up.

1313
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:33,760
Yeah.
And they find the empire state building.

1314
00:56:33,761 --> 00:56:38,761
But like how'd they do it?
They're not gonna find like a backhoe 

1315
00:56:38,761 --> 00:56:38,761
looking at this picture.

1316
00:56:38,761 --> 00:56:39,750
Look at these fucking steroids and 
amazing.

1317
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:44,880
Go back to the other one with the person
in front of it so you can see the 

1318
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:45,090
perspective.
Look how big it is.

1319
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:47,860
Shit.
So I did not think it was that big.

1320
00:56:47,890 --> 00:56:52,890
They're so big dude.
It looked like a staircase and this was 

1321
00:56:52,890 --> 00:56:55,741
one of the things he was saying like we 
don't have the technology to do this 

1322
00:56:55,741 --> 00:56:56,270
right now.
[inaudible].

1323
00:56:56,530 --> 00:57:00,880
Like if you wanted to get someone to go 
out there and move those giant stones,

1324
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:02,110
cut them,
place them.

1325
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:05,020
I mean we kind of have the technology,
but holy Shit,

1326
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:08,470
we did take a lot of money.
Would it take giant fucking cranes?

1327
00:57:08,590 --> 00:57:10,690
It would take forever.
Look at what they did.

1328
00:57:10,691 --> 00:57:13,540
They did this whole structure and all 
these things.

1329
00:57:13,541 --> 00:57:18,541
You got to get the guys to show up.
Think about how it is to like get your 

1330
00:57:18,541 --> 00:57:18,541
kitchen done because I need.

1331
00:57:18,541 --> 00:57:19,930
I need two more weeks.
You know Mike Stone,

1332
00:57:19,931 --> 00:57:24,931
guys out of town.
How long would it take to build 

1333
00:57:24,931 --> 00:57:24,931
something that fucking crazy?
I don't know.

1334
00:57:24,931 --> 00:57:29,140
And so the idea was that aliens came 
here,

1335
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:33,070
built some thing's fucked with our DNA 
and got ghost.

1336
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:36,410
Say Fuck the fuck some early man.
Keeps early man.

1337
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:38,200
A couple of pokes and pokes.
Exactly.

1338
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:43,230
And then decide coyote your backyard.
I didn't finish that story.

1339
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:46,030
So the brooding chicken that was in that
cage,

1340
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:51,780
she honey Dick my mast if into smashing 
open the cage because the massive just 

1341
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:53,770
smashed the cage like she was trying to 
get at the cage.

1342
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,500
Like she was like where the chicken was,
the coyote,

1343
00:57:56,820 --> 00:58:01,820
the coyote was and my masters like I got
this and just smash the fucking thing 

1344
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:05,411
and tore it open.
And then she was running out the back 

1345
00:58:05,411 --> 00:58:06,220
yard with the chicken in her mouth and 
hop the fence.

1346
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:08,260
And I saw her hop the fence with the 
chicken in her mouth.

1347
00:58:08,550 --> 00:58:10,390
I'm like,
I'm living in the Goddamn Disney movie.

1348
00:58:10,391 --> 00:58:11,590
You are.
Look at this.

1349
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:14,260
I just watched a coyote snatched chicken
from the.

1350
00:58:14,261 --> 00:58:15,460
From your yard.
Yeah,

1351
00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:17,020
that's bad ass.
Who was wild?

1352
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:19,780
But the crazy thing is my fucking dog 
standard over there.

1353
00:58:19,781 --> 00:58:20,710
I was like,
asshole,

1354
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:22,750
what the fuck did you do?
Is it guy?

1355
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:23,130
Oh,
it's,

1356
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:23,620
she's,
she's,

1357
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:29,360
she's serious.
Have fun to pull the kill chickens and 

1358
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:32,020
animals are handled today.
I know you can't really expect much more

1359
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:33,160
from a dog.
He's like,

1360
00:58:33,161 --> 00:58:34,660
I don't know.
That dude wanted a chicken.

1361
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:37,420
So he's trying to help these bill,
these stones.

1362
00:58:37,421 --> 00:58:38,710
What part of the world is it,
Jamie?

1363
00:58:38,711 --> 00:58:40,060
So people go look at it.
It's in Peru,

1364
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:42,820
Peru.
And what's the name of the structures?

1365
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:46,230
It's like something tie you.
God,

1366
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,340
I wish I could remember the code 
district.

1367
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:49,450
Costco.
And it's.

1368
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:52,630
Can't want to try to say that bruce got 
some cool stuff.

1369
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:54,130
Is that.
That's not what we were.

1370
00:58:54,131 --> 00:58:55,580
Just looking at it earlier though,
isn't it?

1371
00:58:55,690 --> 00:58:58,000
That's the whole overstructured that's 
what it looks like from the top.

1372
00:58:58,030 --> 00:58:58,890
Yeah,
that's what I googled it.

1373
00:58:58,891 --> 00:59:03,891
And then it's a fortress to holy shit 
that does look like aliens built it well

1374
00:59:04,931 --> 00:59:08,620
or super sophisticated man that was 
wiped out in a disaster.

1375
00:59:08,621 --> 00:59:09,510
That's more likely.
Yeah,

1376
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:12,670
but the crazy thing is how quickly then,
if that's the case,

1377
00:59:12,910 --> 00:59:17,620
how quickly then we came from some sort 
of ape man to what we are now.

1378
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:19,600
You know,
it hasn't been that long.

1379
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:20,710
The,
the,

1380
00:59:20,711 --> 00:59:22,230
the amount.
How long ago was that?

1381
00:59:22,231 --> 00:59:27,231
I think this was built,
this shit was built like at least a 

1382
00:59:27,231 --> 00:59:28,550
thousand years ago I think.
I don't think they know though.

1383
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:33,580
See the problem is if you don't have to 
get stuff from like something that 

1384
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:37,130
someone ate or it has to be like a 
carbon based thing.

1385
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:40,610
You can't test the stone.
You can test some of the material in the

1386
00:59:40,611 --> 00:59:42,220
stone or a,
you know,

1387
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:45,440
like scratches on the stone,
like in crevices and shit like that.

1388
00:59:45,441 --> 00:59:50,441
You can get stuff.
But when they're around things that 

1389
00:59:50,441 --> 00:59:54,381
would have been several thousand years 
of man's advancing at that point a 

1390
00:59:54,381 --> 00:59:54,381
hundred years ago.
Right.

1391
00:59:54,381 --> 00:59:54,640
Wonder because,
I mean,

1392
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:59,660
I don't know.
It's hard to say because I don't know 

1393
00:59:59,660 --> 00:59:59,660
when it was actually built,
when do they think it was built?

1394
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:02,220
So there's all these theories and then 
there's these uh,

1395
01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:03,730
really,
um,

1396
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:06,740
fringe theories that push everything 
way,

1397
01:00:06,741 --> 01:00:07,520
way,
way back.

1398
01:00:07,521 --> 01:00:10,970
And that stuff gets resisted a lot 
because the carbon dating though,

1399
01:00:10,971 --> 01:00:12,200
right?
So in some,

1400
01:00:12,201 --> 01:00:17,201
in some cases occupied since 900,
900 occupied since $900.

1401
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:19,400
900,
somebody moved in.

1402
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:24,800
Yeah.
And then just said to until about the 

1403
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:24,800
13th century.
That's a long run.

1404
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:25,370
So who,
who built it though?

1405
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:27,650
Do they know?
When do they guess?

1406
01:00:28,610 --> 01:00:31,560
I think it does it say like what year it
was built or as you said,

1407
01:00:31,610 --> 01:00:36,610
occupied from 900.
Does that mean that's when they first 

1408
01:00:36,610 --> 01:00:38,960
moved in indicate the earliest 
occupation on the hilltop dates to about

1409
01:00:38,961 --> 01:00:40,090
900 seat.
Oh,

1410
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:41,990
okay.
So wow.

1411
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:47,040
I built it over 400 years or so.
It sounds like so more than a thousand 

1412
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:49,070
years and,
but like you know the jewels in years,

1413
01:00:49,071 --> 01:00:54,071
it's hard to wrap your head around.
The Jewish calendar goes back to like 

1414
01:00:54,071 --> 01:00:54,071
5,700
years ago and I know.

1415
01:00:54,071 --> 01:00:55,190
So there's no nuts,
right.

1416
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:58,400
So band has man had a lot of time to get
some sweet tech,

1417
01:00:58,430 --> 01:00:59,710
but 900.
Yeah.

1418
01:00:59,711 --> 01:01:02,480
It's so arbitrary that we started at 
zero then start up again.

1419
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:04,790
If you go backwards and you go into 
negative numbers,

1420
01:01:04,791 --> 01:01:08,360
like what's so stupid?
So dumb Christians.

1421
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:09,710
It's weird how we do that.

1422
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:10,880
Yeah.
Yeah.

1423
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:16,120
I mean even with like temperature,
no snapping on the metric system is so 

1424
01:01:16,341 --> 01:01:17,500
stupid.
So stupid.

1425
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:22,520
Like you go to places Neela Celsius.
What's it's those 20 slash Celsius 

1426
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:23,980
outside.
What the fuck is 23 cells if you learned

1427
01:01:23,981 --> 01:01:25,490
anything by though.
I agree.

1428
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:26,300
I'm like,
so we should.

1429
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:29,000
We're all going to die.
So we're all gonna die someday.

1430
01:01:30,610 --> 01:01:33,410
So winter had her shorts.
No idea.

1431
01:01:33,411 --> 01:01:36,740
But they,
a lot of them know our stupid shit,

1432
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:39,530
which is interesting.
There's more sort of a we're,

1433
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:41,650
we're like,
that's like a real American movie.

1434
01:01:41,651 --> 01:01:46,651
Like they tried to switch over in the 
seventies to the metrics and people 

1435
01:01:46,651 --> 01:01:46,651
like,
fuck you ain't learned French man.

1436
01:01:46,651 --> 01:01:47,600
Dude.
I remember it.

1437
01:01:47,690 --> 01:01:50,420
I remember it being taught in school.
So I was in school.

1438
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:52,570
They tried,
they tried soccer too.

1439
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:55,580
Yup.
Just pick it up now.

1440
01:01:55,790 --> 01:01:58,550
Just maybe a little heat now.
Little bit,

1441
01:01:58,580 --> 01:01:59,660
little bit,
little bit.

1442
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:00,460
But uh,
yeah.

1443
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:05,560
It's funny to me that stuff that like 
that's Kinda what I love about America 

1444
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:06,080
is that just like that we're not going 
to do with that.

1445
01:02:06,081 --> 01:02:08,600
I'm interested in the rest of the world.
We don't give a shit.

1446
01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:09,890
Fuck.
Fuck.

1447
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:12,170
The metric system.
It sounds fresh.

1448
01:02:12,171 --> 01:02:17,171
It sounds good.
Sounds like a gay sister is made three 

1449
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:18,500
gay math.
Okay.

1450
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:19,980
We're Americans.
It's

1451
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:22,200
better though.
I mean it's intense.

1452
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:24,250
Why are we doing 12?
So it's better and,

1453
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:29,260
and,
but it is confusing when somebody tells 

1454
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:29,260
you a metric,
you know,

1455
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:29,260
they say like,
oh,

1456
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:31,020
it's a leader like leaders of gas.
I'm always aura.

1457
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:33,170
If you drive in Europe and you're 
looking at the,

1458
01:02:33,210 --> 01:02:38,210
you know,
spin on winner and that it has the 

1459
01:02:38,210 --> 01:02:38,210
conversion on there for you.
But whenever we,

1460
01:02:38,210 --> 01:02:39,840
you'd say like 12 inches is a foot.
Like why 12?

1461
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:42,090
Fuck is that?
What is that?

1462
01:02:43,290 --> 01:02:45,510
Why did you,
why'd you arbitrarily.

1463
01:02:46,650 --> 01:02:49,950
And it's only us and a few other 
countries that still accept that.

1464
01:02:49,951 --> 01:02:51,210
Right?
What that 12 inches.

1465
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:54,120
How many people do that?
Do they accept it in Canada?

1466
01:02:54,190 --> 01:02:55,230
Canada's metric,
right.

1467
01:02:55,290 --> 01:02:57,350
And then three feet a yard.
Like thanks.

1468
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:58,570
Canada is metric.
Yeah,

1469
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:00,870
it is.
I think most places are metric.

1470
01:03:01,050 --> 01:03:03,330
Yeah.
I have a friend from Australia,

1471
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:05,490
my friend Adam Green tree,
and he talks in meters.

1472
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:08,550
It was about hunting 20 meters on what 
that means.

1473
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:13,720
Nothing like how many football fields.
How far is that?

1474
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:16,140
There's only two distances.
I understand school bus,

1475
01:03:16,141 --> 01:03:21,141
length of football field.
It's the way things have been taught to 

1476
01:03:21,141 --> 01:03:21,141
me.
Yeah.

1477
01:03:21,141 --> 01:03:21,570
How many meters are in a real unit of 
measurement?

1478
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:23,370
Like a real one,
like an American one.

1479
01:03:23,610 --> 01:03:27,000
How many meters?
How many feet run that fucking meter?

1480
01:03:28,110 --> 01:03:30,580
You have a fucking goofy ass.
Me that.

1481
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:32,080
Yeah,
it's a yacht.

1482
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:34,230
I want to know what a yacht.
Eighty yards.

1483
01:03:34,470 --> 01:03:38,580
Thirty yards away and that's it.
Even when you're in school,

1484
01:03:38,581 --> 01:03:40,590
the only way they teach you about the 
distance of things.

1485
01:03:40,591 --> 01:03:43,020
His stack,
school buses or football field,

1486
01:03:43,250 --> 01:03:46,130
like the moon is 147 billion football 
fields,

1487
01:03:46,131 --> 01:03:51,131
you know like that.
Now I understand whatever the distance 

1488
01:03:51,131 --> 01:03:51,131
is,
but it's always.

1489
01:03:51,131 --> 01:03:52,560
It's always converted.
Two football fields at school.

1490
01:03:52,561 --> 01:03:53,730
Buses are always right.

1491
01:03:53,810 --> 01:03:55,110
Yeah.
As a student,

1492
01:03:55,140 --> 01:04:00,140
that's all I remember ever in science.
He likes taking school buses and going 

1493
01:04:00,391 --> 01:04:01,890
from here to Australia,
you know,

1494
01:04:01,891 --> 01:04:04,080
and you're like,
it's like 97 million school buses.

1495
01:04:05,610 --> 01:04:06,810
That's true.
School buses,

1496
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:09,750
that's constant unit of measurement and 
football fields.

1497
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:11,530
It's all.
Yeah,

1498
01:04:11,590 --> 01:04:14,100
it's true.
The trick of how far does she live?

1499
01:04:14,101 --> 01:04:15,840
Like two football fields with three 
school buses.

1500
01:04:16,810 --> 01:04:18,060
We could walk.
We could.

1501
01:04:19,110 --> 01:04:20,610
It's pretty cold.
It's cold.

1502
01:04:20,611 --> 01:04:22,680
So how cold is it?
Twenty four Celsius.

1503
01:04:22,710 --> 01:04:26,370
Oh,
so a 23 Celsius is probably like,

1504
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:29,100
is that like 70 degrees?
I have no idea.

1505
01:04:29,101 --> 01:04:32,940
I literally have no idea.
I know a little bit about kilos,

1506
01:04:33,210 --> 01:04:38,210
but very little.
I know the limit is 75 slash 2175 slash 

1507
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:40,620
24 slash 75.
All right,

1508
01:04:40,621 --> 01:04:42,420
I'll remember that.
And remember that.

1509
01:04:42,450 --> 01:04:44,220
And that way if it gets to like 30,
I'll go,

1510
01:04:44,221 --> 01:04:49,221
hey,
it must be hot as zero Celsius is 32 

1511
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:51,450
right?
Because they're zero is freezing.

1512
01:04:51,770 --> 01:04:53,790
Zero is our.
That's freezing.

1513
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:57,480
Yes.
But our 40 below is the same as their 40

1514
01:04:57,481 --> 01:05:00,000
below.
Do another math trick.

1515
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:05,030
It's tough.
Nine fifth Celsius plus 32 to nine.

1516
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:08,580
Fifth Celsius plus 32.
Fuck this.

1517
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:10,920
Fuck you.
Why do you do nine?

1518
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:12,480
Almost.
It's almost a half.

1519
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:15,660
A little bit under somebody.
One of you.

1520
01:05:15,661 --> 01:05:17,030
Fuck one of you.
Somebody.

1521
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:18,030
We need to figure out who's

1522
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:19,890
are.
Who's got a simpler thing that.

1523
01:05:20,790 --> 01:05:24,850
Who's got a simpler thing?
Get the fuck out of here with your.

1524
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:28,750
With your fair to mentally switch over 
to Celsius,

1525
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:33,310
but zero Celsius is freezing in 32 
Fahrenheit is freezing.

1526
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:38,360
Yeah,
but it's not just offset by 32 

1527
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:38,360
something.
Something happens around 40.

1528
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:38,740
Below zero.
They become the same.

1529
01:05:39,670 --> 01:05:42,670
I don't know if it maintains for very 
long or degrees.

1530
01:05:42,671 --> 01:05:44,750
Get Colder and I dunno.
Yeah,

1531
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:49,920
I dunno.
It just zero makes more sense as the 

1532
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:53,491
company.
It's weird like how the fuck is if our 

1533
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:54,630
32 is the Celsius zero,
how the fuck is it?

1534
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:55,930
The same thing at 40.
Below.

1535
01:05:55,931 --> 01:05:57,280
It doesn't even make sense.
It makes sense.

1536
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:58,480
Here's another.
Excellent.

1537
01:05:58,481 --> 01:06:03,481
How are you not just adding 30 Canadian,
he said gave you the gay.

1538
01:06:04,090 --> 01:06:06,760
My friend gave me this tip.
Double the centigrade temperature.

1539
01:06:07,390 --> 01:06:11,950
Subtract the first digit of the result 
and the result and then add 32 to that.

1540
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:15,190
Oh okay.
Aren't you really?

1541
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:16,540
Yeah.
So 23.

1542
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:17,930
Oh,
okay.

1543
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:22,940
So 46.
And then what do we do with the first 

1544
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:22,940
digit of the result?
There it is right there.

1545
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:27,241
So 23 Celsius equals 74 Fahrenheit.
Twenty three c plus c times two is 46 

1546
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:32,710
minus the first digit.
So minus the 4:46

1547
01:06:32,740 --> 01:06:37,740
minus four is 42,
42 plus 32 is 74 works.

1548
01:06:38,710 --> 01:06:41,630
Hey fuck you.
By the way,

1549
01:06:42,090 --> 01:06:43,590
by the way,
that's the easy one.

1550
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:49,520
But what's amazing to me is like when 
you meet someone that lets you know like

1551
01:06:49,810 --> 01:06:54,810
what you just talked to them about math 
and they can do like math problems in 

1552
01:06:54,810 --> 01:06:56,230
their head and you realize,
oh I am a baby math baby.

1553
01:06:56,290 --> 01:06:57,700
Oh yeah,
I'm a math baby.

1554
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:58,430
Alright,
totally.

1555
01:06:58,490 --> 01:07:00,280
There's people that were like looking at
that going,

1556
01:07:00,281 --> 01:07:01,240
yeah,
that's what you do.

1557
01:07:01,330 --> 01:07:06,330
That's the obvious thing in my head.
20 slash 74 degrees.

1558
01:07:06,810 --> 01:07:08,800
I'll have moments where like I had this 
recently,

1559
01:07:08,801 --> 01:07:11,560
I was just laying in bed in an insomniac
state.

1560
01:07:11,561 --> 01:07:15,460
Like I offered them in and I was going,
how the hell do you do?

1561
01:07:15,461 --> 01:07:20,461
Long Division,
I know it's like I haven't done long 

1562
01:07:20,461 --> 01:07:24,241
division and I and I tried doing a 
problem and I got it wrong and then I 

1563
01:07:24,241 --> 01:07:25,390
have to read.
I was like,

1564
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:26,340
Oh yeah.
They'll be like,

1565
01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:27,210
you know,
like it was like,

1566
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:28,120
it,
it,

1567
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:33,300
it was,
it was confusing and I haven't done it 

1568
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:34,870
in was the last time you put out a pen 
and paper to do a long division dude.

1569
01:07:34,871 --> 01:07:38,050
I barely do the ad.
The tip part thing,

1570
01:07:38,051 --> 01:07:38,530
right?
Yeah,

1571
01:07:39,410 --> 01:07:42,070
just met down.
You just double it and it moved.

1572
01:07:42,071 --> 01:07:45,130
The decimal adding sucks.
I put that on my instagram recently.

1573
01:07:45,131 --> 01:07:47,800
It was a depression to get on into mit 
in 18,

1574
01:07:47,801 --> 01:07:48,550
69.

1575
01:07:48,590 --> 01:07:53,590
Wow.
So it's really just the order of 

1576
01:07:53,590 --> 01:07:53,590
operations.
If you can figure this out,

1577
01:07:53,590 --> 01:07:57,480
let e equals eight and the following 
equation and there's a bunch of tough.

1578
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:59,530
What is it,
a numerical value of the equation.

1579
01:07:59,531 --> 01:08:01,060
Hint,
as a mentioned,

1580
01:08:01,150 --> 01:08:06,150
as mentioned earlier,
knowledge of the order of operations 

1581
01:08:06,150 --> 01:08:06,150
will be pretty important here.
Scroll down to read the answer.

1582
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:09,550
A lot of people did not get it right,
but most people kind of got it right.

1583
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:10,240
Well,
what is it?

1584
01:08:10,390 --> 01:08:14,220
The answer's 15 to this.
Yeah.

1585
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:17,420
Are you a well versed in these kinds of 
equations?

1586
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:19,160
I remembered how to do it pretty 
quickly.

1587
01:08:19,161 --> 01:08:20,600
That's like a friend showed it to me and
I was like,

1588
01:08:20,601 --> 01:08:22,310
ah,
I don't remember how to do any of that.

1589
01:08:22,430 --> 01:08:25,870
Interesting checkmark.
I'm square root,

1590
01:08:26,330 --> 01:08:28,730
fairly positive.
I never learned any of that.

1591
01:08:29,660 --> 01:08:31,700
Fairly positive,
but that's a good example.

1592
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:36,020
Like I'm a completely illiterate when it
comes to that and that's a cube root.

1593
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:38,030
No one knew what that was either a cube 
root.

1594
01:08:38,150 --> 01:08:39,620
Oh,
second exponent.

1595
01:08:39,830 --> 01:08:42,320
Jesus Christ.
Dude,

1596
01:08:42,321 --> 01:08:47,321
I could.
I literally was just nothing I could do 

1597
01:08:47,321 --> 01:08:47,321
with that.
Well,

1598
01:08:47,321 --> 01:08:49,710
that's what's so fascinating about 
society and that's why you know,

1599
01:08:49,820 --> 01:08:51,500
if anybody tells you,
and it's not all good,

1600
01:08:51,650 --> 01:08:56,650
but that's one of the things that's 
fascinating by society is that there's 

1601
01:08:56,650 --> 01:08:58,460
so many different people with so many 
different abilities and there are people

1602
01:08:58,461 --> 01:09:02,660
that gravitate towards that and are 
wizards at mathematics and there's other

1603
01:09:02,661 --> 01:09:04,550
people like you and I.
they're good at talking shit.

1604
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:06,380
Yeah.
That guy was guy.

1605
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:07,880
We live in a world where that can 
happen.

1606
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:09,170
Oh God,
no.

1607
01:09:09,171 --> 01:09:13,210
I often think about how useless I'll be 
like if the apocalypse goes down,

1608
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:14,870
you're going to be like the dude you 
want to hang out with,

1609
01:09:14,930 --> 01:09:16,250
but the apocalypse goes down.
I'm done,

1610
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:17,960
dude.
If the apocalypse goes down,

1611
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:18,860
whatever happens.

1612
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:20,420
You want it to happen in your 
neighborhood,

1613
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:22,000
so it's over.
Okay,

1614
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:22,700
Gotcha.
Look,

1615
01:09:22,701 --> 01:09:24,800
if a meteor hits,
you want it to hit your house.

1616
01:09:25,030 --> 01:09:27,650
If you're.
If it's an earthquake post apocalyptic.

1617
01:09:27,670 --> 01:09:32,670
Gosh,
society say we both survived it and we 

1618
01:09:32,670 --> 01:09:32,670
living in a shanty town,
we kind of.

1619
01:09:32,670 --> 01:09:33,980
You have skills,
you can hunt,

1620
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:39,550
you can do shit to do something.
I can teach you the things that I know 

1621
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:40,250
how pretty quick.
Bring no value.

1622
01:09:40,970 --> 01:09:45,970
Let's eat first.
You would figure it out after a couple 

1623
01:09:45,970 --> 01:09:46,400
of weeks and fix things.
I know how to fix things.

1624
01:09:46,401 --> 01:09:49,220
I don't know how to hunt with a bow and 
arrow.

1625
01:09:49,270 --> 01:09:51,200
You had figured out,
do you use a gun ever?

1626
01:09:51,201 --> 01:09:52,790
You've ever used it?
Not Anymore rifle,

1627
01:09:52,791 --> 01:09:54,190
but I would.
It's a.

1628
01:09:54,260 --> 01:09:57,170
it's a better way to get meat.
It's more accurate.

1629
01:09:57,230 --> 01:10:00,680
You can do it from further away,
you know,

1630
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:05,720
if it doesn't require nearly as much 
discipline still requires a lot of 

1631
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:09,161
discipline,
but not nearly as much as a bone marrow 

1632
01:10:09,161 --> 01:10:09,161
donor.

1633
01:10:09,161 --> 01:10:09,161
It's just cooler.
It's harder,

1634
01:10:09,161 --> 01:10:11,870
it's way more difficult.
But then there's other people that use a

1635
01:10:12,110 --> 01:10:17,110
traditional bow and they think that guys
like me are pussies because I use a 

1636
01:10:17,110 --> 01:10:17,450
compound bow.
You mean like Lego last bow,

1637
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:22,400
like just one Robin Hood.
Just like a lot of them use recurves,

1638
01:10:22,401 --> 01:10:25,400
but some don't even use recursive old 
school stick bow.

1639
01:10:25,610 --> 01:10:26,480
Really?
Yeah.

1640
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:29,210
There's people that like want to make 
things tougher on themselves.

1641
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:31,730
They want a bigger and bigger challenge 
and you know,

1642
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:36,880
it gets into this weird territory.
So w like some people said like you 

1643
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:40,580
should only hunt with a rifle because 
it's probably the most deadly thing that

1644
01:10:40,581 --> 01:10:45,581
you could use in that situation.
Like so you shouldn't use a bow and 

1645
01:10:45,581 --> 01:10:47,390
Arrow because you're not.
You're not using a bow and Arrow because

1646
01:10:47,391 --> 01:10:50,150
it's more effective.
You're just using it.

1647
01:10:50,210 --> 01:10:52,250
So it's more of a challenge to use.

1648
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:52,720
It's like,
well,

1649
01:10:52,770 --> 01:10:57,770
let's have a bastardization of the 
original idea of what hunting is right 

1650
01:10:57,770 --> 01:10:58,100
now.
Some people feel like that,

1651
01:10:58,490 --> 01:10:59,980
but then other people are like,
no,

1652
01:11:00,110 --> 01:11:02,360
no,
it's just a different kind of hunting.

1653
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:05,870
If you do it correctly,
you have pretty much,

1654
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:09,530
you have less likelihood of success,
but if you do it correctly,

1655
01:11:09,531 --> 01:11:11,750
you have just as much of a likelihood of
killing the animal.

1656
01:11:11,990 --> 01:11:14,850
So it's not like it's an unethical thing
if it's done correctly,

1657
01:11:14,851 --> 01:11:16,800
just requires way more work.
And,

1658
01:11:16,801 --> 01:11:18,240
and,
and like you said,

1659
01:11:18,241 --> 01:11:19,000
more skill.
Yeah.

1660
01:11:19,050 --> 01:11:24,050
But if you were in an apocalyptic 
scenario where we had to go out and get 

1661
01:11:24,050 --> 01:11:27,381
food and you and I went out,
I could teach you what you need to know 

1662
01:11:27,381 --> 01:11:27,390
pretty quick.
That stupid.

1663
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:28,030
No,
you know,

1664
01:11:28,031 --> 01:11:30,570
did the hard part would be learning how 
to be accurate with a bow.

1665
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:31,950
That will be the hardest I want to learn
that.

1666
01:11:31,950 --> 01:11:33,510
I was actually going texted me one day 
and go,

1667
01:11:33,750 --> 01:11:35,300
what's a good starter?
Bo Got,

1668
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:40,460
want to learn how to shoot a bunny.
Real good means a bunch of good 

1669
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:40,530
companies.
I use a white.

1670
01:11:40,740 --> 01:11:42,930
Um,
but there's a bunch of great ones.

1671
01:11:42,931 --> 01:11:47,931
Like Matthew's makes great bows,
is a bunch of companies that make 

1672
01:11:47,931 --> 01:11:48,330
recurve bows,
those which are fun to practice.

1673
01:11:48,331 --> 01:11:49,830
Like Dunkin has a recurve.
He does,

1674
01:11:49,831 --> 01:11:51,360
yeah.
He shoots him in his backyard.

1675
01:11:51,690 --> 01:11:52,830
He loves it.
That's cool.

1676
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:54,510
It's just a fun thing to do,
man.

1677
01:11:54,660 --> 01:11:59,660
Even if you never want to ever shoot an 
animal and you don't even want to eat 

1678
01:11:59,660 --> 01:12:01,650
eggs and just straight up Vegan like 
archery's a fun thing to do.

1679
01:12:01,780 --> 01:12:04,950
It's like a weird kind of a meditation,
you know,

1680
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:10,040
like something happens when you're at 
full draw and you're like holding on 

1681
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:12,300
Arrow and then you release that Arrow 
and it just sales right into the target.

1682
01:12:12,630 --> 01:12:15,780
It gives you this weird charge.
It's like your,

1683
01:12:16,110 --> 01:12:21,110
you're doing like almost like a form of 
yoga with your mind and your body 

1684
01:12:21,110 --> 01:12:23,010
together because like everything has to 
be perfectly still.

1685
01:12:23,220 --> 01:12:26,400
And then on the release,
if it goes in the right spot,

1686
01:12:26,401 --> 01:12:30,060
you get this big burst of satisfaction.
It's really interesting.

1687
01:12:30,061 --> 01:12:35,061
Yeah.
There's something and you can't think 

1688
01:12:35,061 --> 01:12:35,100
about anything else other than the shop 
that you're attempting to make.

1689
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:40,150
Yeah.
You have to keep your eyes on what 

1690
01:12:40,150 --> 01:12:41,601
you're trying to hit.
It's really a mind thing going on with 

1691
01:12:41,601 --> 01:12:41,601
archery.
That's fascinating.

1692
01:12:41,601 --> 01:12:43,980
I do think though,
a shooting a gun is like that.

1693
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:45,870
Not probably not as intense or 
meditative,

1694
01:12:45,871 --> 01:12:48,500
but there's something like it when 
people are like,

1695
01:12:48,550 --> 01:12:50,100
I don't know why anyone wants a gun.
I'm like,

1696
01:12:50,101 --> 01:12:52,810
have you ever shot one?
Really?

1697
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:54,180
I mean,
I don't own a gun.

1698
01:12:54,181 --> 01:12:55,080
I mean,
I live in New York City.

1699
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:57,320
It's not really been an option for me.
But uh,

1700
01:12:57,930 --> 01:12:58,740
you know,
like I said,

1701
01:12:58,770 --> 01:13:00,620
you know,
I've been on it.

1702
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:05,640
I've,
it was when I was in Afghanistan when 

1703
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:07,131
some of those dudes and they were like,
take us to the shooting range and we 

1704
01:13:07,131 --> 01:13:07,131
were shooting all their different ways 
and again,

1705
01:13:07,131 --> 01:13:08,960
it was a war zone.
So I'm not getting into my,

1706
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:10,800
my ethical,
you know,

1707
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:14,060
not a huge fan of aa or fifteens for 18 
year old.

1708
01:13:14,070 --> 01:13:18,090
But I get why people want guns.
I get why people want to own guns.

1709
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:18,490
You know,
I,

1710
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:20,220
I think that's like the argument that 
it's like,

1711
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,860
I wish people would just like take a 
beat and go.

1712
01:13:22,861 --> 01:13:24,600
I like you just said about the abortion 
thing.

1713
01:13:24,660 --> 01:13:28,710
I understand.
You feel like it's like that's okay.

1714
01:13:28,711 --> 01:13:33,711
Okay,
so you feel that way and then it's that 

1715
01:13:33,711 --> 01:13:33,711
way it becomes less of a conversation.

1716
01:13:33,711 --> 01:13:33,711
But we gotta get rid of guns,
more of a conversation about like,

1717
01:13:33,711 --> 01:13:35,730
all right,
we just have to tidy,

1718
01:13:35,790 --> 01:13:37,860
maybe just tidy up a couple of 
components of it,

1719
01:13:37,890 --> 01:13:42,890
you know,
that kind of definitely have to figure 

1720
01:13:42,890 --> 01:13:43,980
out how to stop people from buying them 
legally when they're crazy.

1721
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:46,080
Well there's something wrong with them.
Right.

1722
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:48,900
You know,
I mean here's a question,

1723
01:13:49,350 --> 01:13:54,350
how many of these mass shootings were 
actually done by someone who was in the 

1724
01:13:54,350 --> 01:13:55,080
NRA?
Well,

1725
01:13:55,081 --> 01:13:57,470
according to the people on the right,
none.

1726
01:13:57,750 --> 01:14:00,720
Is that true?
That's what I don't know that that's out

1727
01:14:00,721 --> 01:14:03,690
there right now on twitter.
That's why I wanted to ask you if,

1728
01:14:03,691 --> 01:14:06,530
you know,
that could be a Russian Bot for probably

1729
01:14:07,580 --> 01:14:10,290
just spreading that fake news.
Hashtag fake news.

1730
01:14:10,770 --> 01:14:11,700
But yeah,
a

1731
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:14,500
see if that's real.
Does that make sense to you?

1732
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:16,690
Yeah,
I mean it's an interesting question.

1733
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:18,580
Well,
if that is and then it gets weird,

1734
01:14:18,581 --> 01:14:21,250
like why is everybody attacking the NRA?
Well,

1735
01:14:21,251 --> 01:14:24,550
I know they were the ones who are making
it easier to access these guys.

1736
01:14:24,580 --> 01:14:29,580
They're the ones a cock blocking any 
legislation getting done because they 

1737
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:30,850
have paying so much money to these 
congressmen and senators.

1738
01:14:30,851 --> 01:14:35,851
You know,
if you saw that Lieutenant Governor 

1739
01:14:35,851 --> 01:14:35,851
Delta said they don't,
they don't want to.

1740
01:14:35,851 --> 01:14:36,910
First of all,
I got to be honest with you man.

1741
01:14:36,911 --> 01:14:41,911
Like I had no idea you got like your 
flights are cheaper because you want a 

1742
01:14:41,911 --> 01:14:41,911
gun.
I was like,

1743
01:14:41,911 --> 01:14:46,201
what the fuck dude?
Like I'm just getting ripped off on 

1744
01:14:46,201 --> 01:14:47,260
Delta because I don't own a gun.
Like what a fucking bullshit thing where

1745
01:14:47,261 --> 01:14:50,230
you could actually own a gun.
But it was just like,

1746
01:14:50,260 --> 01:14:51,040
what the fuck?

1747
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:52,990
I didn't know the discounts,
you know?

1748
01:14:52,991 --> 01:14:56,290
It was just such a weird thing to find 
out and now the delta pulled that.

1749
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:57,610
It did.
I was like,

1750
01:14:57,611 --> 01:15:01,660
wait,
but my passive mentality cost more money

1751
01:15:02,410 --> 01:15:07,410
is so the thought is that the NRA has 
made it more easy for crazy people to 

1752
01:15:08,381 --> 01:15:11,470
access these guns and so we did it.
It's like,

1753
01:15:12,180 --> 01:15:17,180
yeah,
the idea that like we can't raise the 

1754
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:17,180
age to 21.
Well,

1755
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:18,550
if you can go to war at 18,
why can't you,

1756
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:19,440
I don't know.
Maybe raising,

1757
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:20,530
I don't know.
I mean,

1758
01:15:20,890 --> 01:15:21,890
uh,
it's,

1759
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:26,940
it seems like when you go to war,
you're getting trained by the military 

1760
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:28,420
versus when you have just 18 and you 
walk into a concern and walk out with an

1761
01:15:28,421 --> 01:15:30,490
ar 15.
Nobody taught you how to use it.

1762
01:15:30,970 --> 01:15:33,160
Literally just bought a gun.
It's a strange,

1763
01:15:33,161 --> 01:15:34,760
like I just,
my,

1764
01:15:34,810 --> 01:15:37,150
my thought on it has always been like 
why not?

1765
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:40,240
Like if you have a driver's license for 
a car,

1766
01:15:40,540 --> 01:15:43,480
but then if you have enough to drive a 
bus or like a truck,

1767
01:15:43,481 --> 01:15:45,070
you have to get a different class of 
driver's license.

1768
01:15:45,071 --> 01:15:46,780
You have to get like a class D or Class 
C,

1769
01:15:46,781 --> 01:15:51,781
whatever the next level is.
There's different classes of driver's 

1770
01:15:51,781 --> 01:15:51,781
license.
Like you can't just go buy a big rig and

1771
01:15:51,781 --> 01:15:56,581
start driving it around the country.
You've got to get a license for driving 

1772
01:15:56,581 --> 01:15:57,250
a big rig,
which means you have to go to school,

1773
01:15:57,310 --> 01:15:59,170
learn how to drive one,
learn how to park one,

1774
01:15:59,171 --> 01:16:04,171
all the things that have fuck it takes 
and you have to prove it to an expert 

1775
01:16:04,171 --> 01:16:04,171
and you have to talk to her about this 
yesterday.

1776
01:16:04,171 --> 01:16:06,970
So why not just have it be that simple,
which is you want own handgun,

1777
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:11,080
just get you get the class,
a handgun license and you take your road

1778
01:16:11,081 --> 01:16:13,030
test which is low,
how to load it,

1779
01:16:13,031 --> 01:16:14,890
know how to clean it,
whatever the rules become.

1780
01:16:14,910 --> 01:16:18,580
And then it takes four hours to pass the
test.

1781
01:16:18,581 --> 01:16:21,160
It's like 10 written questions and then 
that's it.

1782
01:16:21,161 --> 01:16:23,080
And then you get the license and get the
gun and it's yours.

1783
01:16:23,081 --> 01:16:24,880
And then next,
next class you.

1784
01:16:24,881 --> 01:16:26,170
I'd like to own a shotgun.
All right,

1785
01:16:26,171 --> 01:16:27,820
good.
A Class B shotgun license.

1786
01:16:27,821 --> 01:16:30,000
Take the class.
They think fine and then you get to like

1787
01:16:30,010 --> 01:16:31,880
the Ar 15 level and they're like,
oh,

1788
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:34,520
now you have an instructor looking at 
the guy.

1789
01:16:34,521 --> 01:16:37,570
And like,
this guy doesn't seem a little,

1790
01:16:37,571 --> 01:16:39,140
you know,
he's got a little bit like of a dead.

1791
01:16:39,141 --> 01:16:40,050
I here,
you know,

1792
01:16:40,150 --> 01:16:42,090
like maybe we'd all be like,
yeah,

1793
01:16:42,130 --> 01:16:43,780
maybe we'd double check this guy or 
whatever,

1794
01:16:43,781 --> 01:16:44,490
you know,
like you can,

1795
01:16:45,110 --> 01:16:50,110
you can get a sense of people in,
in that environment or if it's a five 

1796
01:16:50,110 --> 01:16:50,920
question question thing you have to 
answer,

1797
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:52,000
you know.
And it's like,

1798
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:53,680
what,
like what are your hobbies?

1799
01:16:53,681 --> 01:16:56,020
And it's like eating rabbits alive,
you know,

1800
01:16:56,030 --> 01:16:56,680
you're like,
damn man,

1801
01:16:56,681 --> 01:16:58,810
that guy.
They hide those answers though.

1802
01:16:59,020 --> 01:17:00,820
I don't know.
I real crazy person.

1803
01:17:00,850 --> 01:17:05,850
A real psychologists can spot a fucking 
crazy person based on how they hide 

1804
01:17:05,850 --> 01:17:06,140
their answers.
Psychologist,

1805
01:17:06,190 --> 01:17:09,490
do you think from the written word?
I think that you could divide tasks.

1806
01:17:09,530 --> 01:17:09,980
I think you could

1807
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:12,260
devise a written test where someone will
be like,

1808
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:17,320
this is an alarming answer to this 
question because it references his 

1809
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:18,200
mother and it has nothing to do with 
this bathrooms or whatever.

1810
01:17:18,201 --> 01:17:19,160
Whatever.
Fucking weird,

1811
01:17:19,161 --> 01:17:24,161
you know?
So I looked at that sounds really 

1812
01:17:24,161 --> 01:17:24,161
unappealing to people and I get that 
they were met,

1813
01:17:24,161 --> 01:17:24,650
but that wouldn't be banning any guns.
That would be.

1814
01:17:24,651 --> 01:17:29,651
You can have any gun you want,
you just have to like do a very basic 

1815
01:17:30,140 --> 01:17:35,140
rudimentary seven question test and go 
to a firing range with a pro for two 

1816
01:17:35,140 --> 01:17:36,740
hours and he has to make sure you know 
what you're doing.

1817
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:40,190
The NRAS perspective is they don't want 
to give an inch.

1818
01:17:40,250 --> 01:17:41,660
Yeah.
Because if they give an inch,

1819
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:44,360
they feel like the ultimate is they're 
just going to lose ground,

1820
01:17:44,390 --> 01:17:45,820
are going to lose more grounded,
more ground.

1821
01:17:45,950 --> 01:17:46,940
What's the slippery slope for?

1822
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:47,540
Yeah,
yeah,

1823
01:17:47,630 --> 01:17:48,040
yeah.
It's,

1824
01:17:48,041 --> 01:17:48,590
it's,
it's,

1825
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:52,250
it's interesting.
Whenever anything happens.

1826
01:17:52,550 --> 01:17:57,550
Like now more than ever,
I think people are demanding some sort 

1827
01:17:57,550 --> 01:18:01,691
of a change.
Like there has to be some sort of a 

1828
01:18:01,691 --> 01:18:02,240
chain says 75 percent of the country 
wants some kind of change.

1829
01:18:02,270 --> 01:18:07,270
Even trump to raise the age.
But it won't happen because the 

1830
01:18:07,270 --> 01:18:09,800
legislation won't pass.
It's one of those things where I,

1831
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:15,040
I seriously doubt,
I'm not saying this is a good or a bad 

1832
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:17,711
thing,
but I seriously doubt if we didn't have 

1833
01:18:17,711 --> 01:18:21,401
guns and all of a sudden guns became a 
thing and we all had to vote as to 

1834
01:18:22,551 --> 01:18:25,010
whether or not everyone should be able 
to have guns.

1835
01:18:25,580 --> 01:18:29,370
I don't think it would have passed.
I don't think it would pass away.

1836
01:18:29,470 --> 01:18:33,710
But it's interesting though because it 
exists now and now you know,

1837
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:39,280
most politicians are in favor of it 
because some are in favor of limiting it

1838
01:18:39,351 --> 01:18:40,490
slightly.

1839
01:18:40,580 --> 01:18:41,660
Well,
they got a lot of money.

1840
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:43,490
Yeah,
a lot of money from the NRA,

1841
01:18:43,850 --> 01:18:47,690
but it's also like who,
and I'm not saying you shouldn't be able

1842
01:18:47,691 --> 01:18:50,450
to have guns,
but who wants us to have guns?

1843
01:18:50,451 --> 01:18:52,070
Like if you just going to be completely 
democratic,

1844
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:55,370
like what percentage of the people 
actually want everybody to have guns and

1845
01:18:55,371 --> 01:19:00,371
what don't.
Just out of pure curiosity with no 

1846
01:19:00,371 --> 01:19:01,160
judgment percentage went everyone to 
have guns.

1847
01:19:01,230 --> 01:19:06,230
I want people to be able to have guns 
and what percentage thinks that no one 

1848
01:19:06,230 --> 01:19:09,581
should have guns?
Like if you add the site Australia or 

1849
01:19:09,581 --> 01:19:09,740
something like that,
all the guns.

1850
01:19:09,741 --> 01:19:14,741
I think it's a much smaller group of 
people that don't want anyone to have a 

1851
01:19:14,811 --> 01:19:16,580
gun.
Like I don't think so.

1852
01:19:17,060 --> 01:19:22,060
I think there's probably like 14 percent
of the country that thinks we'd no one 

1853
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:22,060
should have a gun.

1854
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:26,260
Yeah.
I think the vast majority think we need 

1855
01:19:26,260 --> 01:19:27,200
some new sort of regulations and 
restrictions.

1856
01:19:27,210 --> 01:19:28,640
Absolutely.
Just reasonable,

1857
01:19:29,060 --> 01:19:31,820
reasonable restrict.
I really don't think anyone is saying.

1858
01:19:32,630 --> 01:19:36,710
I mean I think that people,
it's a right that's embedded in the DNA,

1859
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:38,720
the country,
whether you like it or not,

1860
01:19:38,721 --> 01:19:40,160
it's part of the DNA,
the country.

1861
01:19:40,161 --> 01:19:43,880
And like that's very important to day.
It just stays that way forever.

1862
01:19:44,050 --> 01:19:49,050
Well,
I think that to me their arguments can 

1863
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:49,050
be made about this,
which is,

1864
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:50,130
you know,
I don't,

1865
01:19:50,131 --> 01:19:52,220
I don't think people really understand 
how everyone,

1866
01:19:52,610 --> 01:19:57,610
how everyone lives.
I think there's so many different 

1867
01:19:57,610 --> 01:19:57,800
lifestyles in this country that like,
you know,

1868
01:19:57,801 --> 01:20:02,801
I think you have a perception of like 
say like a suburban just outside of 

1869
01:20:02,801 --> 01:20:06,400
metropolis,
kind of a mom that doesn't realize that 

1870
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:06,620
for some people in the country when they
dial nine,

1871
01:20:06,621 --> 01:20:07,130
one,
one,

1872
01:20:07,380 --> 01:20:10,440
it's like a 50 minute response time,
you know,

1873
01:20:10,470 --> 01:20:12,720
like it's not like there's like a local 
firehouse and they could,

1874
01:20:12,721 --> 01:20:17,721
you know,
like people feel like I have to be able 

1875
01:20:17,721 --> 01:20:19,170
to protect my family because I can't 
necessarily rely on the police to come.

1876
01:20:19,170 --> 01:20:19,670
I mean,
I,

1877
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:22,200
I think that's true.
It does happen.

1878
01:20:22,201 --> 01:20:27,201
Yeah.
And I also think that like there's a 

1879
01:20:27,201 --> 01:20:27,201
component to people's fears of like,
you know,

1880
01:20:27,201 --> 01:20:29,670
society on folding and whatever that's 
perpetuated.

1881
01:20:29,671 --> 01:20:34,671
But I actually believe that people from 
the dawn of time have always believed 

1882
01:20:34,671 --> 01:20:36,360
they're going to be the last ones on 
earth.

1883
01:20:36,450 --> 01:20:37,570
You know,
I believe that,

1884
01:20:37,571 --> 01:20:42,571
that they're going to live through the 
apocalypse because I really think it's 

1885
01:20:42,571 --> 01:20:43,170
all about Fomo,
fear of missing out.

1886
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:47,160
And it's this feeling of like,
once I die everyone else should die.

1887
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:52,250
So like,
cool shit doesn't keep happening once 

1888
01:20:52,250 --> 01:20:52,250
I'm dead,
you know,

1889
01:20:52,250 --> 01:20:54,930
but I really do.
I think that people have this instinct 

1890
01:20:54,930 --> 01:20:54,930
of like,
I'm going to die with everyone else.

1891
01:20:54,930 --> 01:20:54,930
It's like,
no,

1892
01:20:54,930 --> 01:20:56,750
you're going to die and then we're going
to forget about you and then cool shit's

1893
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:57,510
going to keep happening.

1894
01:20:57,940 --> 01:20:59,640
And it's like,
I remember when I left the daily show,

1895
01:20:59,641 --> 01:21:00,330
I felt that way.
I'm like,

1896
01:21:00,331 --> 01:21:00,810
yeah,
I'm like,

1897
01:21:00,811 --> 01:21:03,180
good luck at the show.
Kept going.

1898
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:03,690
I was like,
oh,

1899
01:21:03,691 --> 01:21:04,660
they're fun.
I,

1900
01:21:04,790 --> 01:21:06,430
my life has no purpose.
You know?

1901
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:07,620
And it's,
it's that.

1902
01:21:07,621 --> 01:21:11,190
And it's that feeling of like you want,
you want the sea.

1903
01:21:11,310 --> 01:21:12,750
It's like when a football player,
whatever,

1904
01:21:12,751 --> 01:21:15,000
any athlete leaves a team,
they're like,

1905
01:21:15,001 --> 01:21:16,830
yeah,
like good luck winning without me.

1906
01:21:16,831 --> 01:21:18,090
And then they win the super bowl the 
next year.

1907
01:21:18,091 --> 01:21:18,390
I'm like,
yeah,

1908
01:21:18,391 --> 01:21:19,950
you were the problem.
Jeremy Shockey,

1909
01:21:19,951 --> 01:21:24,951
you know,
don't think that applies to the 

1910
01:21:24,951 --> 01:21:26,811
apocalypse though.
I think the apocalypse is people 

1911
01:21:26,811 --> 01:21:29,151
understanding and knowing in their head 
that they're fragile and that they're 

1912
01:21:29,151 --> 01:21:33,321
very environment is fragile and they 
were lucky that it stays the way it is 

1913
01:21:33,321 --> 01:21:36,201
right now.
But the more we learned about 

1914
01:21:36,201 --> 01:21:36,300
supervolcanoes,
asteroidal impacts,

1915
01:21:36,330 --> 01:21:38,040
earthquakes,
tsunamis,

1916
01:21:38,041 --> 01:21:39,960
all the crazy shit that can happen to 
people,

1917
01:21:40,170 --> 01:21:43,470
the more we realize how fucking 
incredibly fragile we are.

1918
01:21:43,470 --> 01:21:48,470
So we're always worried about the big 
thing that happens because there could 

1919
01:21:48,470 --> 01:21:52,221
be a big thing that can happen if some 
super volcano blows and there's ash that

1920
01:21:52,711 --> 01:21:57,240
covers the sun or blocks out the sun and
we lose all our crops.

1921
01:21:57,290 --> 01:22:00,960
It's like a new shortages.
It's 100 percent possible.

1922
01:22:00,990 --> 01:22:05,990
Totally earthquakes.
Fucking asteroidal impacts all that 

1923
01:22:05,990 --> 01:22:07,630
Shit's 100 million asteroid hitting the 
earth or not hideous.

1924
01:22:07,710 --> 01:22:09,590
It's just up to fucking what's floating 
around in.

1925
01:22:10,230 --> 01:22:12,510
Yeah.
And if people have been alive,

1926
01:22:12,511 --> 01:22:16,050
if human beings have been what we are 
now for how many thousands of years,

1927
01:22:16,380 --> 01:22:17,460
what is it like?
Um,

1928
01:22:17,490 --> 01:22:18,360
10,000
maybe.

1929
01:22:18,361 --> 01:22:20,480
No more.
I think more than that.

1930
01:22:20,481 --> 01:22:22,740
Yeah.
I think you're sick about modern humans,

1931
01:22:23,190 --> 01:22:24,740
modern humans,
modern.

1932
01:22:24,790 --> 01:22:26,820
You want to say like 200,000
years.

1933
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:29,130
Does that make sense for modern humans?
Yeah,

1934
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:34,760
I think that's probably wrong though.
I think it's mainly because it depends 

1935
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:34,760
on what we're calling modern.

1936
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:36,330
Like is there a.
that's a good question.

1937
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:38,180
Yeah.
What do we call modern like a,

1938
01:22:38,230 --> 01:22:43,230
a society that has like an African 
economy and trade system,

1939
01:22:43,481 --> 01:22:44,010
you know,
systems,

1940
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:45,870
trade roads,
schools,

1941
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:46,870
shelter,
right.

1942
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:48,510
When it was,
what do we got?

1943
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:52,090
Stone tools was two and a half million 
stone tool,

1944
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:52,980
but that's like.
Yeah,

1945
01:22:52,981 --> 01:22:57,981
but that's a.
I saw an orangutan at the zoo using a 

1946
01:22:57,981 --> 01:22:59,430
stick to try to get bugs.
Then the next thing says a modern man is

1947
01:22:59,431 --> 01:23:00,720
200,000
years ago.

1948
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:01,570
Well,
yeah.

1949
01:23:01,970 --> 01:23:04,560
Okay.
But I guess 200,000

1950
01:23:04,561 --> 01:23:09,561
years ago they look just like us,
but like a homo sapiens pretty close to 

1951
01:23:09,561 --> 01:23:09,760
us.
Yeah,

1952
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:13,510
I'd be.
I bet if you thought a woman for 200,000

1953
01:23:13,511 --> 01:23:14,200
years ago,
you'd be like,

1954
01:23:14,201 --> 01:23:14,950
yeah,
she's hot.

1955
01:23:15,010 --> 01:23:15,460
You know?
You'd be like,

1956
01:23:15,461 --> 01:23:19,690
what the fuck do I do?
Yeah.

1957
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:22,390
That's a long time ago.
That's a long time ago.

1958
01:23:22,810 --> 01:23:23,710
Are you swiping right?

1959
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:25,540
What are you doing?
I was just looking up.

1960
01:23:25,690 --> 01:23:28,090
I was just googling piece of 
information.

1961
01:23:28,990 --> 01:23:33,990
Yeah,
that's a crazy notion when you really 

1962
01:23:33,990 --> 01:23:34,000
think of 200,000
years,

1963
01:23:34,270 --> 01:23:36,220
200,000
years ago we weren't even people.

1964
01:23:36,460 --> 01:23:41,460
We were some,
some other thing that became people 

1965
01:23:41,460 --> 01:23:41,460
like,
what are we going to become?

1966
01:23:41,460 --> 01:23:41,460
Yeah.
I just feel like,

1967
01:23:41,460 --> 01:23:43,240
like I like when you go back to 100,000
years,

1968
01:23:43,241 --> 01:23:45,880
it feels like you're,
you know,

1969
01:23:45,940 --> 01:23:49,390
that's like pretty close to like caveman
era.

1970
01:23:50,370 --> 01:23:52,730
This caveman I,
which really crits,

1971
01:23:52,731 --> 01:23:54,460
not like ape man,
but it's like,

1972
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:56,440
you know,
like super primitive,

1973
01:23:56,950 --> 01:23:59,620
primitive,
but that's modern human I guess.

1974
01:23:59,930 --> 01:24:03,550
I think that was,
that was revised something recently that

1975
01:24:03,551 --> 01:24:06,020
modern human was like when you have 
trade,

1976
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:06,930
which,
you know,

1977
01:24:07,060 --> 01:24:12,060
like civilization,
like the more you know versus the versus

1978
01:24:12,401 --> 01:24:15,310
the actual body being.
You know,

1979
01:24:15,700 --> 01:24:18,010
I think they used to think it was where 
Iraq is.

1980
01:24:18,340 --> 01:24:21,460
I think they thought that was the oldest
Tamia that area.

1981
01:24:21,540 --> 01:24:22,750
Um,
Sumir.

1982
01:24:23,080 --> 01:24:27,280
They think that that was the one of the 
first real civilizations.

1983
01:24:27,550 --> 01:24:29,140
They think that was the first day.
Well,

1984
01:24:29,141 --> 01:24:31,090
at least the first evidence of written 
language.

1985
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:34,660
And there's a lot of it there.
Sumeria Mesopotamia as in fact the first

1986
01:24:34,661 --> 01:24:39,661
known complex civilization developing 
the first city states in the fourth 

1987
01:24:39,661 --> 01:24:40,210
millennium,
BC.

1988
01:24:40,211 --> 01:24:45,211
He,
it was around these cities at the 

1989
01:24:45,211 --> 01:24:47,221
earliest known form of writing.
Cuneiform script appeared around 3000 

1990
01:24:47,771 --> 01:24:48,860
bce.
Yeah.

1991
01:24:48,970 --> 01:24:53,560
I like everything OBC now for the Non 
Christians before current era,

1992
01:24:53,740 --> 01:24:56,320
like what is weight?
Why is it current?

1993
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:58,970
What's the,
what is that bce?

1994
01:24:58,980 --> 01:25:03,980
Sneaky Bitch.
So that's what it was even earlier than 

1995
01:25:03,980 --> 01:25:04,390
that.
I didn't think it was 3000 likes.

1996
01:25:05,180 --> 01:25:08,130
Five Jewish calendar,
right?

1997
01:25:08,131 --> 01:25:13,131
Yeah.
Fifty 700 years ago where they like 

1998
01:25:13,131 --> 01:25:13,131
started keeping track of shit and they 
had like,

1999
01:25:13,131 --> 01:25:17,280
you know,
so that's what they watch and that's 

2000
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:20,340
about all those structures like the 
pyramids and all those different things 

2001
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:23,641
that you think that there was advanced 
civilizations that died off and that 

2002
01:25:23,641 --> 01:25:23,641
that's why all those things were there.

2003
01:25:23,641 --> 01:25:26,210
Well you know about like the library in 
Alexandria?

2004
01:25:26,250 --> 01:25:28,630
Yeah.
That's one of those things that probably

2005
01:25:28,631 --> 01:25:33,631
loss of thousands of years,
they burned all the shit the Egyptians 

2006
01:25:33,631 --> 01:25:35,950
knew like thousands of years.
Like we might not ever figure it out,

2007
01:25:35,980 --> 01:25:40,980
but I'm saying like just God knows what 
they had discovered and how we could 

2008
01:25:42,131 --> 01:25:44,830
have stacked our science on top of that.
And right now be,

2009
01:25:45,370 --> 01:25:48,250
who knows,
we could be living to like 250 years old

2010
01:25:48,251 --> 01:25:50,110
for all we know,
like we don't know what they knew or how

2011
01:25:50,111 --> 01:25:52,300
they built that shit.
Like it's just like what?

2012
01:25:52,590 --> 01:25:55,750
That's like total religious move.
Too much knowledge in here.

2013
01:25:56,590 --> 01:25:57,700
Get rid of it.
The enemy.

2014
01:25:57,800 --> 01:25:59,800
We're never,
we're never going to be able to convince

2015
01:25:59,801 --> 01:26:01,330
these people have an invisible cloud 
band.

2016
01:26:01,331 --> 01:26:02,640
If they could read these books were 
burned.

2017
01:26:02,650 --> 01:26:07,650
This fucking picked out.
People had been apparently going back 

2018
01:26:07,650 --> 01:26:09,410
and forth to Egypt forever knowledge.

2019
01:26:09,410 --> 01:26:11,030
They would go there to learn shit.
Yeah.

2020
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:13,460
And it was,
it was a lush place.

2021
01:26:13,590 --> 01:26:14,990
Yeah,
it was a,

2022
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,970
a Patra.
It was closer.

2023
01:26:17,010 --> 01:26:22,010
Cleo.
Cleopatra is closer to the birth of the 

2024
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:23,750
iphone than she is to the construction 
of the pyramids.

2025
01:26:24,460 --> 01:26:29,460
Whoa.
So if you go from Cleopatra to today is 

2026
01:26:29,460 --> 01:26:31,580
a shorter time period than Cleopatra to 
the construction.

2027
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:35,630
That's crazy.
Wrap your fucking head around that jazz.

2028
01:26:35,900 --> 01:26:38,690
That's crazy.
And if you listen to Graham Hancock,

2029
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:40,230
um,
and uh,

2030
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:45,280
John Anthony West,
this guy was an egyptologist who just 

2031
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:45,280
passed.
They think that it goes back way further

2032
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:50,231
than that.
They think that the pyramids of Giza 

2033
01:26:50,231 --> 01:26:50,231
might be from 2,500
years ago,

2034
01:26:50,231 --> 01:26:51,140
but they think there's a lot of shit in 
Egypt.

2035
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:56,440
Giant things,
including the spanx that are thousands 

2036
01:26:56,440 --> 01:26:56,440
and thousands of years older than that.
Well,

2037
01:26:56,440 --> 01:26:58,100
did you see that they just invented this
new air sonar?

2038
01:26:58,250 --> 01:27:03,250
Yes.
That Guatemalan society in the fucking 

2039
01:27:03,250 --> 01:27:03,620
jungle.
That's crazy.

2040
01:27:03,660 --> 01:27:07,520
My mind exploded all that crazy.
Did you see that lost city ofZ ,

2041
01:27:07,910 --> 01:27:11,240
that movie he didn't touch on my.
It's a movie I want to watch,

2042
01:27:11,241 --> 01:27:12,830
but then I watched the trailer and I was
like,

2043
01:27:13,100 --> 01:27:15,710
Moshe Kasher sent me the book and I 
almost read it,

2044
01:27:15,711 --> 01:27:17,180
but then I found out there was a movie.
I'm like,

2045
01:27:17,181 --> 01:27:22,181
fuck you go.
Let's knock this out in an hour and a 

2046
01:27:22,181 --> 01:27:22,181
half.
Huh?

2047
01:27:22,181 --> 01:27:27,110
For sure.
It's not as good though because portia 

2048
01:27:27,110 --> 01:27:27,110
was raving about the book.
Oh,

2049
01:27:27,110 --> 01:27:30,881
by the way,
congratulations to Moshe and Latasha 

2050
01:27:30,881 --> 01:27:30,881
from making,
making people.

2051
01:27:30,881 --> 01:27:32,530
Oh,
they made a burson testing,

2052
01:27:33,890 --> 01:27:37,120
but that city of z movie was really 
interesting because this,

2053
01:27:37,150 --> 01:27:42,150
these,
these people were just the raw cost of 

2054
01:27:42,150 --> 01:27:44,591
raw adventurous.
I mean you can get horrible mosquito 

2055
01:27:44,591 --> 01:27:47,051
bites and then go into the jungle,
these crazy Englishman and like that to 

2056
01:27:47,051 --> 01:27:49,220
me was what was interesting about that 
book to try to see.

2057
01:27:49,370 --> 01:27:51,380
I don't know,
I was really well done.

2058
01:27:51,381 --> 01:27:56,381
So I assume that their version of like 
what these English scholarly gentleman 

2059
01:27:56,421 --> 01:27:59,810
were like when they were planning out 
these epic mega trips,

2060
01:28:00,410 --> 01:28:02,240
but when you were watching it take 
place,

2061
01:28:02,241 --> 01:28:07,241
like the way they did it in the movie,
you really felt like that could have 

2062
01:28:07,241 --> 01:28:08,480
been how it went down and this crazy 
fucking guy went just deep,

2063
01:28:08,481 --> 01:28:13,481
deep,
deep into the jungle looking for a lost 

2064
01:28:13,481 --> 01:28:13,481
civilization.
Journals and things.

2065
01:28:13,481 --> 01:28:14,930
Which most of those students did you 
know it,

2066
01:28:15,030 --> 01:28:20,030
you have to take,
I guess what they're writing with a 

2067
01:28:20,030 --> 01:28:20,030
grain of salt because you're like,
I want to make myself sound as bad as as

2068
01:28:20,030 --> 01:28:24,401
possible for sure.
But they definitely found some stuff 

2069
01:28:24,401 --> 01:28:24,401
back to.
They went,

2070
01:28:24,401 --> 01:28:28,300
they found pottery and they found a 
bunch of different things that the guy 

2071
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:29,810
colonel pursue faucet.
Is that his head?

2072
01:28:30,470 --> 01:28:32,810
Oh Wow.
They think it might be his head.

2073
01:28:33,590 --> 01:28:35,030
Oh Dude,
go to that page.

2074
01:28:35,070 --> 01:28:37,970
Police.
We need to know about this shit.

2075
01:28:38,570 --> 01:28:40,850
Strange stories,
Dun Dun Dun.

2076
01:28:41,030 --> 01:28:42,320
Yeah.
They'd probably killed that dude and cut

2077
01:28:42,321 --> 01:28:47,321
his head off.
I mean that's what they were doing to 

2078
01:28:47,321 --> 01:28:48,671
people down there.
They probably got tired of this white 

2079
01:28:48,671 --> 01:28:48,671
dude stumbled around through the forest.
Had thing.

2080
01:28:48,671 --> 01:28:49,030
Yeah.
How do they shrink head?

2081
01:28:49,250 --> 01:28:54,250
They cut your skull out.
This is the thing I used to think they 

2082
01:28:54,250 --> 01:28:54,440
shrunk the whole skull and everything.
I'm so stupid.

2083
01:28:54,441 --> 01:28:57,680
I already told you how dumb I am when it
comes to eggs with shrunken heads.

2084
01:28:57,681 --> 01:28:58,250
I thought,
Huh?

2085
01:28:58,270 --> 01:29:00,950
They got some fucking solution.
It makes their head shrink up.

2086
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:01,680
No,
no.

2087
01:29:01,681 --> 01:29:04,560
They take the skull out and then they 
take the skin,

2088
01:29:04,710 --> 01:29:09,710
stitch it all up together and then they 
do something with it to make it like 

2089
01:29:09,710 --> 01:29:09,740
shrivel up like a put a.

2090
01:29:09,810 --> 01:29:12,090
put a coconut or something in there.
I don't remember.

2091
01:29:12,540 --> 01:29:15,600
I don't remember how they make it.
That would have never in a million years

2092
01:29:15,601 --> 01:29:20,601
have you asked.
That was shrunken head would make and 

2093
01:29:20,601 --> 01:29:20,601
they stuff it.
I would have no,

2094
01:29:20,601 --> 01:29:24,470
I wouldn't even guess.
I think they stuff it to kind of looked 

2095
01:29:24,470 --> 01:29:25,140
like the guy that's his head.
That's homeboys head.

2096
01:29:25,700 --> 01:29:26,260
Yeah,
they,

2097
01:29:26,370 --> 01:29:27,060
they,
they,

2098
01:29:27,930 --> 01:29:29,970
they chopped that dude up and did 
something to his head.

2099
01:29:30,620 --> 01:29:32,130
Wow.
That is so crazy.

2100
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:37,520
But what a.
But a dark way of approaching other 

2101
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:38,820
human beings.
They have his eyeballs stitched up.

2102
01:29:39,210 --> 01:29:42,070
They have a rope coming out of his mouth
for like a.

2103
01:29:42,230 --> 01:29:44,770
just a carrying strap.
Yeah.

2104
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:46,830
So you know,
you can put it on your belt.

2105
01:29:46,831 --> 01:29:49,050
Might be right.
They stitched his mouth up though,

2106
01:29:49,051 --> 01:29:54,051
right?
It doesn't look like his mouth is 

2107
01:29:54,051 --> 01:29:54,051
stitched up.
That looks like a little bit.

2108
01:29:54,051 --> 01:29:54,180
Yeah.
It's like they made a key chain,

2109
01:29:54,260 --> 01:29:55,260
you know,
that's what it looks like.

2110
01:29:55,261 --> 01:29:58,260
They got that little loop.
They carried that dude around their dick

2111
01:29:58,730 --> 01:30:01,040
just walked through the forest.
It was,

2112
01:30:01,110 --> 01:30:03,270
it was all for a novelty store in 
Venice.

2113
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:08,680
That was their version of forever 21 
little like Hudson News in town with 

2114
01:30:09,550 --> 01:30:11,700
little knickknacks.
What a fucked up practice.

2115
01:30:11,820 --> 01:30:14,070
Cutting people's heads off,
taking the skin off,

2116
01:30:14,250 --> 01:30:17,050
stitching it all up and shrinking it,
but yeah,

2117
01:30:17,070 --> 01:30:18,990
but again,
it's like we were talking about food.

2118
01:30:18,991 --> 01:30:21,270
It's like we got a lot of fucked up shit
we did here too.

2119
01:30:21,390 --> 01:30:22,080
Oh yeah.
No.

2120
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:23,970
Smallpox on blankets.
That wasn't.

2121
01:30:23,971 --> 01:30:25,780
That's not really fucked up.
It's not right.

2122
01:30:25,810 --> 01:30:26,880
No,
no,

2123
01:30:26,970 --> 01:30:31,970
no.
They didn't even know what bacteria was 

2124
01:30:31,970 --> 01:30:34,260
back then that they would just know that
they can figure out how to get.

2125
01:30:34,330 --> 01:30:36,090
No,
apparently it's an urban myth.

2126
01:30:36,270 --> 01:30:40,160
Apparently,
depending on urban or rural.

2127
01:30:40,950 --> 01:30:45,950
It's a wild west.
Apparently would happen was just the 

2128
01:30:45,950 --> 01:30:47,520
first European settlers just alone by 
their presence,

2129
01:30:47,521 --> 01:30:52,521
killed somewhere around 90 percent of 
the native America bringing outside 

2130
01:30:52,521 --> 01:30:56,841
disease,
all kinds of crazy shit that people had 

2131
01:30:56,841 --> 01:30:57,360
no immune systems for and that this idea
that they did it all with blankets would

2132
01:30:57,420 --> 01:31:02,420
look the is not to say that people 
didn't do horrible things to the native 

2133
01:31:02,420 --> 01:31:03,510
Americans.
They absolutely did and it's not to.

2134
01:31:04,050 --> 01:31:07,740
Not to in any way,
diminish the genocide that took place on

2135
01:31:07,741 --> 01:31:11,340
the native Americans,
but I don't think that the blanket thing

2136
01:31:11,370 --> 01:31:13,740
was true because they didn't know how to
isolate syphilis.

2137
01:31:14,010 --> 01:31:19,010
I mean,
unless they just went to pe patients 

2138
01:31:19,010 --> 01:31:19,010
that had syphilis,
smallpox,

2139
01:31:19,010 --> 01:31:19,560
smallpox,
whatever it was.

2140
01:31:19,590 --> 01:31:21,680
You're right.
Not just what I thought I guild alcohol.

2141
01:31:21,750 --> 01:31:22,880
I thought they just knew.
Yeah,

2142
01:31:22,950 --> 01:31:23,800
I got my stories mixed up.

2143
01:31:23,820 --> 01:31:26,640
It's a good way to go out.
I guess you go blind,

2144
01:31:27,380 --> 01:31:29,220
sarcastic,
but yeah,

2145
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:30,650
I just think,
um,

2146
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:31,610
the,
the,

2147
01:31:31,650 --> 01:31:34,740
just exposure to Europeans killed the 
great many of them.

2148
01:31:35,190 --> 01:31:40,190
And uh,
there's a guy named Dan Flores that I 

2149
01:31:40,190 --> 01:31:40,190
had on my podcast.
It's a,

2150
01:31:40,190 --> 01:31:41,310
an expert in history of animals in North
America.

2151
01:31:41,311 --> 01:31:44,250
I think I heard that podcast.
Fucking guys are genius.

2152
01:31:44,251 --> 01:31:49,251
He's brilliant.
But he was talking about buffalo and 

2153
01:31:49,251 --> 01:31:52,551
that when the native Americans died off 
and like literally 90 percent of them 

2154
01:31:52,551 --> 01:31:55,680
were killed by European diseases.
It's just crazy.

2155
01:31:56,340 --> 01:31:59,040
And a lot of them that were killed off 
by Europeans,

2156
01:31:59,050 --> 01:32:04,050
the buffalo were in hunted anymore.
So they grew to these mammoth 

2157
01:32:04,050 --> 01:32:07,201
proportions.
So it's his contention that those giant 

2158
01:32:07,201 --> 01:32:10,650
fields of buffalo,
that people experience where there was 

2159
01:32:10,650 --> 01:32:13,051
like thousands and thousands and 
thousands of Buffalo stampeding and 

2160
01:32:13,051 --> 01:32:14,980
cross the field that would have never 
taken place if the same amount of native

2161
01:32:14,981 --> 01:32:19,981
Americans had been there previously 
because they weren't controlling the 

2162
01:32:19,981 --> 01:32:19,981
population.

2163
01:32:19,981 --> 01:32:23,500
They were the primary Predator because 
all they did was follow these.

2164
01:32:23,501 --> 01:32:24,670
I mean that's why they had these 
teepees.

2165
01:32:24,671 --> 01:32:29,671
A lot of them would follow the herds of 
buffalo and they'd peck at it from the 

2166
01:32:29,671 --> 01:32:29,990
outside.
It just nomadic culture.

2167
01:32:30,010 --> 01:32:31,390
Yeah.
And they just stayed with the Buffalo.

2168
01:32:31,391 --> 01:32:33,790
But they also kept their numbers down 
because you know,

2169
01:32:33,791 --> 01:32:36,520
if there's several hundred native 
Americans or how many in their camp,

2170
01:32:36,521 --> 01:32:37,020
right?
They're,

2171
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:42,200
they're killing a couple buffalo a day 
every day and everybody's eating it and 

2172
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:42,940
then there's no refrigerator.
So go after it again,

2173
01:32:43,450 --> 01:32:45,880
keep following it.
So they're basically just eating buffalo

2174
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:50,170
and shooting arrows at them and taking 
the populations down all the time.

2175
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:51,760
That's so interesting.
It's crazy.

2176
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,830
I'd never heard it before.
He was on my friend,

2177
01:32:53,831 --> 01:32:54,970
Steve Rinella,
his podcast,

2178
01:32:54,971 --> 01:32:58,090
and he explained it on there.
And then Rinella explained it to me also

2179
01:32:58,091 --> 01:33:00,880
independently,
and then I had him on the podcast.

2180
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:05,880
Then I read his book too.
He's got two books to see if he could 

2181
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:07,350
find the titles of Dan Flores books.
Yeah,

2182
01:33:07,351 --> 01:33:09,810
I mean it makes sense.
One of them actually use a paper.

2183
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:11,730
Populations expand exponentially.
Right.

2184
01:33:11,731 --> 01:33:13,260
So it's like the daily America,
right?

2185
01:33:13,470 --> 01:33:16,620
Is that it?
Cody America is.

2186
01:33:16,621 --> 01:33:21,621
His new book is a coyote.
America said about the history of the 

2187
01:33:21,621 --> 01:33:21,621
coyote within North America.
Dude,

2188
01:33:21,621 --> 01:33:23,460
it's fascinating shit guys.
Genius.

2189
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:25,230
Yeah.
He looks like he knows a lot about.

2190
01:33:25,231 --> 01:33:27,150
Like he knows a lot of shit with western
animals.

2191
01:33:27,300 --> 01:33:32,300
Any live.
He lives in New Mexico and you get 

2192
01:33:32,300 --> 01:33:32,300
street cred with naturalists.
If you live in New Mexico,

2193
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:37,520
you know that's a place for.
Whereas a lot of dudes that have a gray 

2194
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:38,200
ponytails.
Yeah,

2195
01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:40,680
like a lot of great dudes going a little
new agey,

2196
01:33:40,710 --> 01:33:42,000
a little,
a little scary.

2197
01:33:42,001 --> 01:33:43,020
A little new age.
Santa Fe.

2198
01:33:43,021 --> 01:33:44,430
That's where tate's from tape.

2199
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:47,010
Fletcher's from their co owner of 
caveman coffee.

2200
01:33:47,011 --> 01:33:48,960
Simply delicious and really pumps you 
up.

2201
01:33:50,450 --> 01:33:51,870
Well played.
Thank you.

2202
01:33:52,690 --> 01:33:53,400
No,
I've never had one.

2203
01:33:53,401 --> 01:33:54,450
It was caveman,
nitro.

2204
01:33:54,930 --> 01:33:56,610
Um,
how susceptible are you to caffeine?

2205
01:33:58,590 --> 01:34:00,310
Two hundred 70 milligrams and that 
motherfucker.

2206
01:34:00,330 --> 01:34:02,820
That's what versus how much in a cup of 
coffee?

2207
01:34:02,930 --> 01:34:07,380
A large starbucks I think is that much 
like a Venti starbucks.

2208
01:34:08,160 --> 01:34:10,380
How many times we've gone over this and 
I can never remember the numbers.

2209
01:34:10,740 --> 01:34:15,740
I want to say that a Venti starbucks is 
like 250 or 240 and that's it to 70.

2210
01:34:16,411 --> 01:34:19,860
It's a touch mode.
I don't really need it.

2211
01:34:20,210 --> 01:34:22,330
Alright Bro.
We'll see what scared I don't drink.

2212
01:34:22,710 --> 01:34:24,420
I thought you were kind of giving me the
vibe of like,

2213
01:34:24,421 --> 01:34:25,470
look,
I don't have too many.

2214
01:34:25,710 --> 01:34:26,430
No,
no,

2215
01:34:26,431 --> 01:34:28,200
no.
I just got a new shipment.

2216
01:34:28,620 --> 01:34:29,820
No,
that's not what I was giving the vibe.

2217
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:33,900
I just always tell people because I've 
given it to people and then like an hour

2218
01:34:33,901 --> 01:34:34,500
into the show,
they're like,

2219
01:34:34,501 --> 01:34:35,700
dude,
I'm on crack.
