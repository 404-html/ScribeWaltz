1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,640
The joe rogan experience.
They try everything.

2
00:00:02,641 --> 00:00:04,920
This scare marijuana smokers.
Why?

3
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:06,870
Why is that?
They should just smoke weed and get

4
00:00:06,871 --> 00:00:09,330
their dick sucked.
They would change the way they feel

5
00:00:09,331 --> 00:00:10,830
about all this.
They'd be like,

6
00:00:10,831 --> 00:00:13,520
I can't believe blowjobs feel so good,
dude.

7
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,120
Dude,
dude,

8
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:14,910
dude,
dude,

9
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:15,760
dude,
dude,

10
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:16,723
dude,
dude.

11
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,610
It's from someone who loves you.
Who tickles your balls when you come in

12
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:21,570
their mouth?
Hey,

13
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,630
while you're high Jesus Louisa's.
Okay.

14
00:00:24,631 --> 00:00:26,220
They don't know about that.
Do they know about that?

15
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,920
Because if they do,
you know I would imagine if you're a,

16
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:30,840
the sheriff at Greenlee knows about
that.

17
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,100
If you're a girl and you smoke a couple
of hits a weed and then get your pussy

18
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,540
licked,
that's kind of feel so good.

19
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,210
Could you imagine like a shower feels
good when you're high?

20
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,130
You can imagine how good it feels for
girl.

21
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,410
Do you think your ass licked?
Do I like my ass?

22
00:00:43,411 --> 00:00:43,700
Like,
yeah.

23
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,950
Listen,
you and I and you're never going to have

24
00:00:45,951 --> 00:00:50,630
this conversation right now.
It ends here.

25
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,300
It ends here with you.
I'm not opening those doors.

26
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,780
What kind of a man asks another man.
This is like a fill out form for a

27
00:01:02,781 --> 00:01:04,760
fucking gang bang video.
Okay.

28
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:07,740
Now do you like getting your ass like,
because if yes,

29
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,130
check the box to the right.
That should never come up.

30
00:01:10,131 --> 00:01:13,730
You should go from you cradle to the
grave without anybody ever asking you do

31
00:01:13,731 --> 00:01:15,060
you like it in your ass,
right?

32
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:18,650
Or maybe maybe that should be it.
That should be a fun thing about a

33
00:01:18,651 --> 00:01:21,110
funeral is you have to write the answer
yes or no.

34
00:01:21,111 --> 00:01:23,640
Like on a piece of paper and then have
it in your hand like when you're done.

35
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,460
Yeah,
like in the open casket,

36
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,870
I secretly love you.
Did you check his note?

37
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,450
That was a yes with two exclamation
points.

38
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,950
You see the problem with the question
like do you like your ass?

39
00:01:37,951 --> 00:01:40,370
Licht is,
that's not how anybody ever asks it.

40
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,920
If they're gonna lick your ass,
right.

41
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,060
They don't go.
Do you like to get your ass loads?

42
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,450
They don't say that.
They would say,

43
00:01:45,451 --> 00:01:46,840
do you want me to lick your ass?
Huh?

44
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:48,420
Huh.
They would have a lot of,

45
00:01:48,421 --> 00:01:49,260
has in there.
Like,

46
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:50,310
all right.
Want me to look your ass?

47
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:51,360
Huh?
You do?

48
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,430
Huh?
Like they're already affirming it cause

49
00:01:53,431 --> 00:01:55,920
it's a risky thing to say like,
you want me to lick your ass?

50
00:01:55,921 --> 00:01:58,380
Huh?
Let me try it again,

51
00:01:58,381 --> 00:02:00,120
Joe.
This is an affirmation of it.

52
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,560
You know,
it's like you,

53
00:02:02,561 --> 00:02:04,500
you want to,
we want that person to have an easy time

54
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:05,334
saying yes.

55
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:05,920
No,
no.

56
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,490
I,
it's like,

57
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,940
Huh?
You want me to look at your ass?

58
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,020
And you go,
well that would be cool.

59
00:02:10,021 --> 00:02:11,220
Yo,
you fucking sick.

60
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:12,750
Fuck.
Fuck you.

61
00:02:12,751 --> 00:02:15,130
I checked you asshole.
Right,

62
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,650
right.
The bedroom opens up,

63
00:02:16,651 --> 00:02:20,340
the camera crew comes in,
you've been on the new show.

64
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:24,230
Do you want your ass comes like a big
court case where they tried to figure

65
00:02:24,231 --> 00:02:28,670
out what what ha means when you add on
to it and then the lawyer tries to

66
00:02:28,671 --> 00:02:31,530
defend it clearly if she used the word,
Huh?

67
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,410
She was,
she was trying to get a positive

68
00:02:34,411 --> 00:02:38,160
affirmation out of him.
She was a manipulating his emotional

69
00:02:38,161 --> 00:02:41,220
responses.
The natural responses of a person.

70
00:02:41,221 --> 00:02:44,430
He was doing it to be polite.
You didn't really want his ass select

71
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,410
okay.
He didn't want her to feel bad.

72
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,610
She said hot already.
Yeah.

73
00:02:48,611 --> 00:02:49,640
Okay.
Well,

74
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,810
as it was happening,
he was realizing he had made a mistake.

75
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:53,813
Yeah.
You know,

76
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,740
it'd be like joining an army that thinks
they're going to go out and fight big

77
00:02:56,741 --> 00:02:58,690
foot.
Like you got all your fucking gear and

78
00:02:58,691 --> 00:02:59,860
you're ready.
Go to the mountains,

79
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:02,380
like we are the sasquatch.
And He'd be like,

80
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:03,280
Oh,
what have I done?

81
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,470
What have I done?
I can't believe I'm going to go.

82
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,720
This is an army of people I've joined.
Fuck,

83
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,550
I made a mistake.
Shit.

84
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:13,180
He can't pull out of it.
That's what it's gotta be like.

85
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,793
It's crazy.

86
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,030
Well,
that's where you,

87
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,300
you know,
you are known for not just being,

88
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,790
uh,
one of the pioneers of MMA,

89
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:32,820
but you're known for that expression
Yamato Democracy that you have always,

90
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:38,110
you've always promoted that ideal,
this,

91
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:41,920
this Samurai spirit and this,
this spirit of Japan,

92
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:45,760
this way of,
of doing things wholeheartedly.

93
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:49,960
And you know,
you've talked openly that you freely

94
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,540
give yourself,
like when you would go to fight and you

95
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:53,470
would be ready to die.

96
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,593
Yes.

97
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,250
And not just saying that like you,
you would really reconciled it in your

98
00:03:59,251 --> 00:04:00,930
mind.
You would say goodbye to your friends,

99
00:04:00,931 --> 00:04:02,650
say goodbye to your family versus a fire

100
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,020
letters.
I wrote letters to people that I wanted

101
00:04:06,021 --> 00:04:09,530
to say goodbye to every fight.
Yeah.

102
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,280
That's some deep shit.
You know,

103
00:04:11,281 --> 00:04:16,281
it was the thing too is I'm
fighting to die flying to die.

104
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,450
You're going to train with the will to
die too,

105
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,830
so you can write it down as good
training I got in.

106
00:04:22,831 --> 00:04:27,831
Yeah.
I mean I'm training every day before the

107
00:04:28,521 --> 00:04:30,650
fight,
so I won't die in the fight.

108
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,660
I'm planning,
I'm okay.

109
00:04:32,661 --> 00:04:35,210
I'm accepting the fact that I might die
there,

110
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:40,490
but I know that the better I can be is
the less chance to me dying in the rain.

111
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:41,841
So,
you know,

112
00:04:41,841 --> 00:04:43,950
I'm not going to get up in the morning
and because I'm sore,

113
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:48,990
I'm not going to miss training because
I'm tired or I'm lazy because it'll

114
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,760
might be the difference in me living in
dying in the room.

115
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,300
So,
you know,

116
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,110
it helped me out a lot.
And then the training aspect and you

117
00:04:57,111 --> 00:04:57,831
know,
the dieting,

118
00:04:57,831 --> 00:04:59,690
I mean I want to eat,
I want to drink a coke,

119
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,110
but I'm trying to eat only good things
on my before my flight.

120
00:05:03,111 --> 00:05:05,540
And it's,
it's a lot easier to do that when you're

121
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:08,360
in it to that level.
It can't hurt you,

122
00:05:08,361 --> 00:05:10,330
you know,
to plan to die in the ring to,

123
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:14,930
to believe that and to train and to walk
that life for that three months while

124
00:05:14,931 --> 00:05:16,700
training for the fight it,
they can't hurt you.

125
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:22,620
Is it difficult for you because you
earnestly embraced that thought process?

126
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:28,120
Is it difficult for you when you see
guys that are kind of dabbling in mma

127
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,510
that Kinda like half asking it,
not training hard enough?

128
00:05:31,511 --> 00:05:34,870
Maybe they have some talent but they
don't really put their will and heart

129
00:05:34,871 --> 00:05:35,530
into it.

130
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,820
Well,
it's a whole new era now.

131
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:39,640
Yeah.
Because back in the day we didn't get

132
00:05:39,641 --> 00:05:40,600
paid good.
We weren't,

133
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,550
we weren't,
weren't that worried about,

134
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:44,710
you know,
losing a sponsor here,

135
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,600
right.
Being cut by the UFC,

136
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:47,710
you know,
that kind of stuff didn't,

137
00:05:47,711 --> 00:05:51,310
because there was all these little
association with funding for so little

138
00:05:51,311 --> 00:05:53,760
bit money.
The objective and the,

139
00:05:53,761 --> 00:05:56,260
the,
the whole movement of that error was

140
00:05:56,261 --> 00:05:56,891
different.
Yeah.

141
00:05:56,891 --> 00:05:57,724
So,
you know,

142
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,650
when fighters start getting lazy,
you know,

143
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,480
Eh,

144
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,810
or they don't fight as hard or the tap
out a little sooner.

145
00:06:04,811 --> 00:06:06,460
You know,
I understand that because there's a

146
00:06:06,461 --> 00:06:09,010
whole new era because you're fighting
for a different reason though.

147
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,740
They're fighting for money.
They are fighting for living.

148
00:06:11,741 --> 00:06:13,660
They're fighting for sponsors.
If we need to look good,

149
00:06:13,661 --> 00:06:16,570
you know,
so it's easier when you're fighting for

150
00:06:16,571 --> 00:06:17,404
those reasons.

151
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:18,750
Okay.

152
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,850
I mean,
there's only so much money will make you

153
00:06:20,851 --> 00:06:21,760
do.
