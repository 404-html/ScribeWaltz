1
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:05,340
People like it's not natural.
I say what the fuck is natural?

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:10,873
Okay.

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,530
We're full Morgan Murphy.
We are alive.

4
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,710
We are alive.
We are alive.

5
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,290
How are Ya?
Fuck is going on.

6
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,420
Is that a space balls tee shirt you
wearing?

7
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:23,621
Uh,
no.

8
00:00:23,621 --> 00:00:26,330
It's um,
the no,

9
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,840
no limit.
No limit soldier tee shirt.

10
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:30,910
Oh Shit.
Like master P,

11
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:34,300
whatever happened to that dude.
He's got a weed store.

12
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:36,030
I think murder.
Oozie murder.

13
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:37,450
Isn't he in jail for murder?
How odd.

14
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,130
There's a lot of,
uh,

15
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,630
yeah.
A lot of people are in jail for murder

16
00:00:40,631 --> 00:00:41,650
right now.
It's very big.

17
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,450
Yeah.
You don't have to do a your entire life

18
00:00:46,451 --> 00:00:47,860
though.
I used to think that every time you

19
00:00:47,861 --> 00:00:49,150
murdered someone,
that's it.

20
00:00:49,151 --> 00:00:51,700
You go to jail for life and people get
out of jail for murder.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,770
Yeah.
That seems a little fucked up.

22
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:57,070
It doesn't seem a little far down.
A little fucked up to have to,

23
00:00:57,071 --> 00:00:58,240
uh,
I always imagine like,

24
00:00:58,241 --> 00:00:59,890
I wonder if they go back to their
hometown,

25
00:00:59,891 --> 00:01:02,920
like where they murdered somebody.
Like that's always the fucked up part.

26
00:01:02,921 --> 00:01:05,080
To me.
It's like going back to the place where

27
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:07,420
you're the town murderer.
Yeah.

28
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,930
It's fucked up.
The in moment of just a freak out.

29
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,170
You could change your whole life.
You'll have just fucked and the other

30
00:01:14,171 --> 00:01:16,660
end of the person's life just isn't
around anymore.

31
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:18,940
Just stops done.
Yeah,

32
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,950
the finality of it all.

33
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,070
Okay.

34
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:23,540
It's crazy.
It's a little uncomfortable.

35
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:26,120
I don't want you a snapping.
I feel like you get snap.

36
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,460
I'm not as an opera Aria.
I'm super calm.

37
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:29,211
Really?
Yeah,

38
00:01:29,211 --> 00:01:32,570
pretty much.
Especially in like physical altercation

39
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,450
time stuff.
I'm very aware of consequences.

40
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,450
What if you were on like your 10th lift
of something,

41
00:01:38,451 --> 00:01:41,600
like an aggressive workout and you're in
the middle.

42
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,190
You have all the,
you know,

43
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,140
all your energy is just moving forward
and you're lifting your kettle thing and

44
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:52,370
it's number 10 and someone just comes in
and like tells you your mom's stupid.

45
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:56,630
I would be even less likely to do
anything because I'm already exerted.

46
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,400
I get it.
I think of the body.

47
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,610
This is a shitty theory,
no biology attached to it at all.

48
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:06,710
But I think the body is like a battery
and I think almost like maybe a battery

49
00:02:06,711 --> 00:02:10,970
of a battery was a bucket and this thing
can overflow.

50
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,460
And I think that's what you get when you
get road rage.

51
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,980
That's what you get.
You get people at snap for no reason.

52
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,320
I think they're already coming at you at
like eight.

53
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,640
They're not like,
hi,

54
00:02:19,641 --> 00:02:20,421
I'm Morgan.
Hi,

55
00:02:20,421 --> 00:02:22,430
I'm Joe.
And we meet each other at zero.

56
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,290
Right.
I think some people are meeting,

57
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,120
yeah,
they're already at six and they're just

58
00:02:26,121 --> 00:02:27,160
ready to snap.
Right.

59
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,810
It has nothing to do with you.
They should have let a little out of the

60
00:02:29,811 --> 00:02:31,670
starbucks,
a little out in the car,

61
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,440
a little out,
you know,

62
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:36,620
at home with the kids and then a,
and then they wouldn't murder anybody at

63
00:02:36,621 --> 00:02:38,120
the end of it.
And people will say,

64
00:02:38,121 --> 00:02:38,990
well,
you know,

65
00:02:38,991 --> 00:02:42,440
you just need to work on your breathing
and well you need to work on your,

66
00:02:42,441 --> 00:02:46,190
your being present and you need to be
mindful.

67
00:02:46,191 --> 00:02:47,900
And I think all those things are
correct.

68
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:51,350
But I really think that your body has a
certain amount of requirements and I

69
00:02:51,351 --> 00:02:55,580
think depending upon your stress level,
those physical requirements might be

70
00:02:55,581 --> 00:02:56,480
higher,
right?

71
00:02:56,481 --> 00:03:01,030
Like if you have a job and your job is
like some high accountant at some big

72
00:03:01,031 --> 00:03:04,690
firm and you're crunching numbers and
it's fucking stressful as shit,

73
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:10,140
I feel like your body thinks that there
is some physical danger involved.

74
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,840
And I think your body amps up for that.
And then when the physical danger

75
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:17,890
doesn't come,
your body's just fucking primed and

76
00:03:17,891 --> 00:03:19,360
ready to go.
But there's nothing,

77
00:03:19,361 --> 00:03:21,580
there's no action,
there's no fucking action.

78
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,820
This fucking duck got me off.
And then they start doing that shit.

79
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,820
Fuck,
fuck you that get in their car and

80
00:03:27,821 --> 00:03:28,571
they're just,
fuck you.

81
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:30,760
Fuck you.
Because in your car you're ramped up

82
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:34,450
even more because in your car you're
aware that you have to be,

83
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:39,010
you have to be really acutely aware of
everything that's around you.

84
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,590
You have to make sure that no one's
making any mistakes because you're all

85
00:03:41,591 --> 00:03:45,280
going 65 miles an hour and a little eric
and happened really quickly.

86
00:03:45,281 --> 00:03:48,040
So you're on edge already.
When you're in your car,

87
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,460
even if you're calm,
you're,

88
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,010
even if you're calm,
you're in your car,

89
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,710
your sensors are tuned in.
If you're fucking paying attention,

90
00:03:53,711 --> 00:03:56,350
if you're a healthy human being,
you're looking left and looking in the

91
00:03:56,351 --> 00:03:57,011
mirror.
You look in,

92
00:03:57,011 --> 00:03:58,780
right?
You're checking and make sure that

93
00:03:58,781 --> 00:04:00,250
you're okay.
You making sure that no one's doing

94
00:04:00,251 --> 00:04:03,550
anything stupid,
and then you compound that with the

95
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:06,370
stress of your daily life with no
physical release.

96
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,900
Right.
We don't have animals.

97
00:04:07,901 --> 00:04:12,550
Casey now send anymore invading tribes.
That would be fun though to have a

98
00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:14,590
buffalo chase you all day and then you
would have,

99
00:04:14,591 --> 00:04:17,530
you would release the proper amount of
energy given the threat.

100
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,710
It would be a realistic,
we'd have a more realistic population.

101
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,030
Yeah,
I like it.

102
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,670
That would be one thing.
We don't like that though.

103
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:26,710
We just,
whenever anything like gets like too

104
00:04:26,711 --> 00:04:28,330
close,
we just kill them off.

105
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,880
Just kill them off.
Fuck that.

106
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,370
Fuck.
I've buffalo's everywhere.

107
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,383
Fuck.
Kill him.

108
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:34,800
Just fucking kill him.
Stop.

109
00:04:34,801 --> 00:04:36,600
Stop.
There's consequences.

110
00:04:36,601 --> 00:04:37,800
I don't know.
I gotta I gotta go to work.

111
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,480
Kill it,
kill it.

112
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,760
That's a bigger problem.
Went round in America.

113
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:45,580
Do you know that a,
they reintroduced wolves into America in

114
00:04:45,581 --> 00:04:48,640
the 1990s.
Now there's this giant debate whether or

115
00:04:48,641 --> 00:04:49,870
not wolves should be here.
Oh,

116
00:04:49,871 --> 00:04:51,520
really?
Where'd they do that?

117
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,690
Yellowstone.
Yeah.

118
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,370
I think they're bad ass,
but you've got to keep an eye on the

119
00:04:57,371 --> 00:04:58,600
fuckers.
Yeah.

120
00:04:58,601 --> 00:05:00,220
I get a lot of coyotes in my,
uh,

121
00:05:00,221 --> 00:05:01,600
in my neighborhood.
A lot of,

122
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:05,290
kind of a lot of coyote neighbors,
super common all the time.

123
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:08,320
I had a biologist on who tracks coyotes.
It's what he does.

124
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,230
Oh,
he does track Iot is around Los Angeles

125
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,011
and he's like,
dude,

126
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:13,050
they're fucking everywhere.
Yeah.

127
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:16,390
So they were living in middle of
downtown La and the most crowded area,

128
00:05:16,391 --> 00:05:19,330
they had a debt.
It's crazy.

129
00:05:19,331 --> 00:05:20,460
Yeah.
I call my neighbor is my,

130
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,580
not when there's a coyote,
if I see a coyote going up their

131
00:05:24,581 --> 00:05:25,270
driveway,
go,

132
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:25,850
hey,
as a kid.

133
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:28,600
And I had called them.
If somebody knocks on the door and

134
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:31,420
asking for money for some organization
and everyone gives each other and alert,

135
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,690
oh,
that wasn't the coyotes or a proper

136
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,280
environmental la or whatever.
Yeah.

137
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,760
Those people just knocking on your door.
Ooh,

138
00:05:39,761 --> 00:05:43,360
that's a bad feeling.
I gave him money for bees one time they

139
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:45,400
got me,
it got me all nervous about bees and

140
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,350
saving the bees and I was like,
Oh shit.

141
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,440
I gotta say I really went from like,
I'm,

142
00:05:49,441 --> 00:05:51,190
I'm having coffee and a cigarette to
like,

143
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,750
oh,
I got to save the bees now it's my

144
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:54,580
responsibility to solely do it

145
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:57,710
does not also depend on like where your
head's right?

146
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,070
Like if

147
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,830
your head is it a really good place and
someone knocks on the door and you don't

148
00:06:00,831 --> 00:06:02,150
know who they are,
it's cool.

149
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,013
You're like,
hi.

150
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:03,591
You know,
like hi,

151
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:05,180
we're here to save chimpanzees.
You're like,

152
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,200
oh,
okay.

153
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,520
Like what do you,
what do you guys do?

154
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,050
And then you start talking to him.
Well,

155
00:06:09,051 --> 00:06:11,720
if they can like within a minute,
make you understand something you didn't

156
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:12,740
understand before,
you're like,

157
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,570
oh shit,
now I got to pay attention.

158
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,030
Right.
They sucked me in because I wasn't aware

159
00:06:17,031 --> 00:06:18,500
of our bee situation.
Oh,

160
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:20,960
so they immediately hit you with some
facts and facts.

161
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,520
I was like,
oh boy.

162
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,350
Now,
how are they going to save these bees?

163
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:25,940
I don't know.
Let me get with my,

164
00:06:25,941 --> 00:06:29,640
with my $40.
I think just here,

165
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,200
take this paper when just go handle it.
Yeah,

166
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,760
go handle it.
Yeah.

167
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:34,790
If the bees die,
we're dead.

168
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,010
We're all dead apparently except in
China.

169
00:06:37,011 --> 00:06:39,490
They figured out a way to pollinate
things with uh,

170
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:42,470
just a brush.
There was an issue where they were

171
00:06:42,471 --> 00:06:45,500
really low on bees and they tried
reintroducing bees and it didn't take.

172
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:49,010
So um,
last ditch effort was they took people

173
00:06:49,011 --> 00:06:54,011
with a paintbrush and they dusted the
pollen on all these different plants.

174
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:59,180
Like one at a time they pollen,
they literally pollinated all these

175
00:06:59,181 --> 00:07:03,920
plants and apparently worked way better
because bees are sort of nonspecific.

176
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,950
Like bees are just going over there and
they're doing their thing and they just

177
00:07:06,951 --> 00:07:09,530
get shit on their body and it transfers
over to the plants.

178
00:07:09,531 --> 00:07:11,300
It's really kind of fascinating how it
works,

179
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,780
but these people did it very
specifically with a paintbrush.

180
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,490
It was really interesting to do a,
b,

181
00:07:16,491 --> 00:07:18,890
it's job.
The person who can find the video of it.

182
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:23,420
It's kind of fucking weird because like
you could make the argument like we

183
00:07:23,421 --> 00:07:25,730
don't really need to beach once you want
honey,

184
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,800
honey is not even really good for you.
How about that?

185
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:30,710
That was going through my head and then
they explained to me why we need bees,

186
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:34,880
which I forgot but
it was enough.

187
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,790
I had a guy come to me at whole foods.
This is my most intrusive,

188
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,630
I think the most intrusive is when
you're in the parking lot at whole foods

189
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,320
cause that's when they usually get ya.
When you're walking out they try to get

190
00:07:45,321 --> 00:07:48,140
you right as you're walking around it's
fucking hot outside and you have like

191
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:50,120
ice cream and shit and you're like hey
dude,

192
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,000
you also like 17 you know $17 ice
creams.

193
00:07:53,001 --> 00:07:55,430
They know you have a,
they know you have a few bucks cause

194
00:07:55,431 --> 00:07:58,370
right now because of Amazon we want to
do that anymore.

195
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:02,000
Amazon just bought whole foods so we'll
just just be able to one click your

196
00:08:02,001 --> 00:08:04,100
shit.
But I'm this guy,

197
00:08:04,101 --> 00:08:06,670
he hits me up,
stops me in the middle,

198
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,660
like stops me,
stands in front of my car,

199
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:11,210
puts his finger up.
Do you have one minute for gay rights?

200
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:15,440
Like what's that one minute is not gonna
help shit man.

201
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:17,750
Like what are you talking about?
I vote like what do you,

202
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,490
what do you want me to do?
Want me to donate?

203
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,690
Is it,
what's this one minute.

204
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,760
What do you gonna tell me?
What are you going to tell me?

205
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:23,810
No,
can you tell me Shit?

206
00:08:23,811 --> 00:08:24,141
I go,
no,

207
00:08:24,141 --> 00:08:26,420
I do not.
I vote for gay rights though.

208
00:08:26,421 --> 00:08:28,760
Take it easy man.
Like you fucking,

209
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,300
that's an annoying activist.
What a whole fish.

210
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:35,600
Is this at the hills right here.
Right up the street.

211
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:41,150
Fab is trying to figure out where that
whole foods alliance.

212
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:44,090
I don't know what the deal is like where
they're allowed to have people.

213
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:45,470
This was a couple of years ago.
Honestly,

214
00:08:45,471 --> 00:08:47,570
I just still complain about it because
I'm kind of a whiny bitch.

215
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,240
But um,
I don't know what the deal is.

216
00:08:50,241 --> 00:08:53,810
Like are you allowed to just set up shop
anywhere and put like one of those

217
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,980
picnic stands and you know they

218
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,290
have like one of those little plastic
tables.

219
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:01,710
They sat down and they show you a
picture of a baby with a bloated belly

220
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,910
and to show you,
yeah,

221
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,660
you hope it's girl scout cookies and it
turns out to be just a horror show.

222
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,090
Yeah.
Pending apocalypse.

223
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,140
I almost think like when I see someone
like some kids selling lemonade or

224
00:09:13,141 --> 00:09:14,100
something like that,
I'm like,

225
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,780
oh,
this is like you guys are doing like a

226
00:09:15,781 --> 00:09:19,380
throwback thing.
I almost feel like,

227
00:09:19,381 --> 00:09:20,730
oh,
you guys are doing like an old time.

228
00:09:20,731 --> 00:09:22,710
You're making your own butter.
Look at your kids.

229
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,420
You're,
I think this is not sustainable.

230
00:09:24,421 --> 00:09:26,160
This is not a real thing anybody does
anymore.

231
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,290
You get a lemonade stand.
Okay.

232
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,160
Did you,
did you,

233
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,130
how did you make,
did you get a horse and ride your horse

234
00:09:32,131 --> 00:09:34,710
over here with this lemonade stand?
There's all these parents now helping

235
00:09:34,711 --> 00:09:35,100
lemony.

236
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,440
You can't do it alone.
You can't do anything alone anymore.

237
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,760
Oh wise.
It's always parents there and soy.

238
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,300
Those helicopter parents don't touch
somebody's belly.

239
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,270
Don't put junk in your mouth.
I would sell a,

240
00:09:45,271 --> 00:09:47,520
when I was a kid,
I would like take my books and stuff and

241
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:49,710
sell them in my front yard.
Like I would just put them out.

242
00:09:49,711 --> 00:09:51,660
I thought it was fun to have my own
garage sale,

243
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,250
but I didn't see my mom for like,
you know,

244
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,480
seven hours of the day and I come back
and sign.

245
00:09:55,481 --> 00:09:56,020
She goes,
do you do,

246
00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:00,240
I made $4 like she didn't know how I
made $4 just selling all my shit in the

247
00:10:00,241 --> 00:10:03,630
front yard and she didn't see me or ask
me anything.

248
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,210
Different Times,
different times,

249
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,980
parents were just,
they just let you out,

250
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,300
they let you out.
But I was,

251
00:10:09,301 --> 00:10:11,370
this was like in the 80s,
which was priming.

252
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,710
That was like a,
that was kidnapping was,

253
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,780
was hot.
You know,

254
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,970
your mom had faith and you're avoidant
skills maybe.

255
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:19,820
Yeah.
Yeah.

256
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,020
You think about like how people used to
raise people.

257
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,690
Like everybody I talk to,
they just let their kids out.

258
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,600
Like when you were,
you know,

259
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:30,030
my age,
I'm 49.

260
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,320
When I was like,
uh,

261
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:34,170
seven 42 years ago.
They just let,

262
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,610
yeah,
the House I got,

263
00:10:35,611 --> 00:10:37,920
I used to get kicked out of the house,
but I was given a time.

264
00:10:37,921 --> 00:10:39,630
I had to be back.
It was a very like,

265
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:44,990
broken system of like get out,
but come back by five and don't walk

266
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:48,630
under the overpass tunnel.
Like I was given the rules.

267
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:53,950
That's where the trolls given rules.
Like what year did they stop doing that?

268
00:10:54,691 --> 00:10:57,330
Like just letting kids out.
Like when did that stop?

269
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,390
Because everyone my age says the same
thing.

270
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,700
They said when we were kids.
Did you get just let out of your house,

271
00:11:02,701 --> 00:11:03,630
Jamie?
Yeah.

272
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,190
Jamie's young.
How old are you,

273
00:11:05,191 --> 00:11:06,600
Jamie?
34.

274
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:09,060
He's younger.
A lot of 22 year old.

275
00:11:09,061 --> 00:11:11,350
Like they're fucking dude old ship
broke.

276
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,370
Somebody called me a geriatric on
twitter the other day.

277
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,420
I was like,
how dare you,

278
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,750
how dare you.
But if you,

279
00:11:18,751 --> 00:11:20,790
uh,
if you're Jamie's age,

280
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,460
you've got let out.
We would ride our bikes miles away from

281
00:11:23,461 --> 00:11:24,360
our house.
Yeah,

282
00:11:24,361 --> 00:11:25,740
but you lived in the woods?
No,

283
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,130
it down by Columbus.
That's the woodsman you might as well,

284
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,970
and I would walk down,
I would walk down Ventura Boulevard.

285
00:11:32,971 --> 00:11:35,490
I'm just like a practically a
thoroughfare when you're a kid.

286
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,560
Oh God.
I would walk past like they had these

287
00:11:37,561 --> 00:11:40,240
motels where the door opened,
uh,

288
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:42,630
open directly to the sidewalk.
You know those motels?

289
00:11:42,631 --> 00:11:43,670
Yeah,
those are the best.

290
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,250
That was where I was sure I was going to
get kidnapped and her arm was going to

291
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,310
come out and grab me in.

292
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:50,520
So I would walk and then I'd hop past
the doors,

293
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,370
the motel doors,
motels,

294
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,940
pay my beeper bell.
Those are weird places.

295
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:58,540
Yeah.
Pay Your beeper to beeper at a pager.

296
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:01,480
It was like a 12 and that was like what?
I saved up all my money for it because

297
00:12:01,481 --> 00:12:05,050
everyone had one.
No one wanted me messages.

298
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:05,951
Yeah,
I had,

299
00:12:05,951 --> 00:12:09,880
I had all that shit and I would die.
Walked down to J and j beepers in studio

300
00:12:09,881 --> 00:12:12,870
city and paying cash.
It's like a 12 year old,

301
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,490
my beeper bill.
And then I would jj king of beepers.

302
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,140
Is that it?
I think it's the same.

303
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,450
A Cha,
same la like this.

304
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,720
There was a lot of j and J.
I feel like people uh,

305
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,810
stole the still the name.
I forgot about that dude.

306
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:29,980
The king of beepers at Turquoise.
Clear.

307
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,720
Get a clear beeper.
Those rare,

308
00:12:31,721 --> 00:12:32,500
those are slick.

309
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,240
That's some star wars shit.
I'd be,

310
00:12:34,241 --> 00:12:38,530
I paid myself so that I had messages in
there so people looked at it.

311
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:43,260
I had no friends.
The king of beepers is,

312
00:12:43,261 --> 00:12:46,330
this is Jj bupers Las Vegas.
Oh,

313
00:12:46,331 --> 00:12:49,690
well he was in la too.
I don't know if the same guy or maybe

314
00:12:49,691 --> 00:12:51,220
like,
it's one of those things where it's like

315
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,620
Kleenex,
like all the other guys,

316
00:12:53,621 --> 00:12:56,530
like that's the right name for it.
Just start calling ourselves Kleenex,

317
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,290
you know,
like it became,

318
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:03,190
do you think that it was all jay?
Jay is pink dots and there's also pink

319
00:13:03,191 --> 00:13:05,920
elephant.
Like I think people just kind of a

320
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:10,170
little pink pink's,
they probably started it.

321
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:14,800
The hot dog place doesn't,
just the biggest weird fucking event in

322
00:13:14,801 --> 00:13:17,440
La is a God damn line of people to buy
hot dogs.

323
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,880
Nobody from ally.
Well,

324
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,430
here's the thing,
put hot dogs on a regular fucking menu.

325
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:24,190
Good luck.
Better not by a lot of hot dogs.

326
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,030
Like if you have a rescue regular
restaurant and you have hot dogs as one

327
00:13:28,031 --> 00:13:30,310
of the offerings,
how often do people,

328
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,440
is it even won a 10 hot dog?
If it's like one of two options,

329
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:39,310
like at Burbank airport you can get,
you can get a hot dog or like a packet

330
00:13:39,311 --> 00:13:41,680
pre packaged salad and occasionally I'm
like,

331
00:13:41,681 --> 00:13:43,870
you know,
I want something fresh like a hot dog or

332
00:13:43,871 --> 00:13:47,350
a Turkey sandwich that's sort of moist
and some weird way.

333
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,680
The bread's kind of what like fuck is
this right?

334
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:54,940
Wet bread in lieu of a Mayo or
condiments and of course it's sporting

335
00:13:54,941 --> 00:13:56,470
events.
The UFC,

336
00:13:56,471 --> 00:13:58,690
there was a hot dog,
hot dog at a sporting.

337
00:13:58,691 --> 00:14:02,050
It's good.
It's good food for a sporting event for,

338
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:03,770
you know,
it's recreational food,

339
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,830
right?
Picnics and barbecues.

340
00:14:05,831 --> 00:14:06,280
Sure.

341
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,330
Always hot dogs,
right?

342
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:10,420
It's a good move for a barbecue.
It's simple.

343
00:14:10,421 --> 00:14:12,700
You can't really fuck it up.
If it looks brown on the outside,

344
00:14:12,701 --> 00:14:15,600
it's done right.
You could eat it raw.

345
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:18,460
It doesn't need to be cooked.
You can eat it right out of the package.

346
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:20,530
So that's,
it's a good move for that.

347
00:14:20,531 --> 00:14:24,520
But somehow another pink's is convinced.
People just by cooking outside,

348
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,270
they just have a big open area where the
cooking right in front of you and

349
00:14:28,271 --> 00:14:28,951
everyone was like,
Oh,

350
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:33,490
I wore lows and there's a fucking line.
I think the line is why people go,

351
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,160
I think people,
people have to go for a line and the

352
00:14:36,161 --> 00:14:38,530
line is outside.
You can see the line.

353
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:42,340
It's not like Astro Burger,
like 2:00 AM where you can't see the

354
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:43,720
line.
The line is exciting.

355
00:14:43,721 --> 00:14:48,280
It's what draws tourists.
I think that's Jamie Masada strategy.

356
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,010
See the line.
He's always got that crazy line outside

357
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:51,883
the laugh factory

358
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,080
and he makes a comics wait in line too.

359
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,410
Really?
Do you don't know the hill a little

360
00:14:58,411 --> 00:14:59,191
while but no,
no,

361
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:00,210
no.
I don't know that

362
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,940
they're open.
Mike deals kind of nuts.

363
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:05,150
Like you have to get there at like nine
in the morning and you wait outside and

364
00:15:05,151 --> 00:15:08,840
if you leave you lose your spot.
So you have to like have some sort of a

365
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:09,674
friendship with the other.

366
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,420
Yeah,
yeah,

367
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,820
yeah.
I would say the comedy store had it

368
00:15:12,821 --> 00:15:14,370
situated.
I mean the open mic when,

369
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,450
when I was started with,
it was like 15 years ago,

370
00:15:16,451 --> 00:15:17,284
I would,
uh,

371
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:21,480
Bobby Lee was the host of the open mic
and he knew I had to,

372
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:24,130
I was in college,
I was in school and I was in class so I

373
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:28,150
couldn't go all day and wait.
So he would slide my name into the open

374
00:15:28,151 --> 00:15:29,980
mic and I didn't get to come after
class.

375
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,330
That's sweet.
That was real cute.

376
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:33,450
Real cute.
The,

377
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,830
the open mics were always weird.
Right.

378
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:39,370
There are always weird.
And in La they're extra weird cause

379
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:42,400
there's so much.
I feel like if you can make it to be a

380
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:45,220
professional comedian and you started
out in La,

381
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,020
you're a rare person.

382
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:47,871
Well it's all,
it's,

383
00:15:47,871 --> 00:15:49,940
it's,
it's 50,

384
00:15:49,941 --> 00:15:53,300
50 comedians and then just like,
you know,

385
00:15:53,301 --> 00:15:55,940
mentally ill,
transient also comedians,

386
00:15:55,941 --> 00:15:57,410
but we're also committed.
Yeah.

387
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,700
Yeah.
It's all,

388
00:15:58,701 --> 00:16:00,050
you just,
you just wait and you go,

389
00:16:00,051 --> 00:16:01,580
all right,
it's going to be my friend.

390
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:05,840
And then it's going to be a,
that guy who has all of his belongings

391
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:08,870
with him and then it's going to be my
other friend and then it's going to be

392
00:16:08,871 --> 00:16:10,370
that crazy lady and then will be me.

393
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:14,470
Can you just wait,
wait and wait and wait and you just

394
00:16:14,471 --> 00:16:19,471
wonder what kind of fucking diseases are
just festering on that microphone and

395
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:22,360
also just what's the point of this?
What am I doing right,

396
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,000
especially in the beginning.
Yeah.

397
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,000
To have vision and hope.
Like what was your initial goal when he

398
00:16:28,001 --> 00:16:29,050
first started doing stand up?

399
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,450
Um,
the really simply like a,

400
00:16:31,451 --> 00:16:34,240
I think it was,
I knew I liked writing a lot.

401
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:37,890
Like even before I started doing standup
and I think stand up,

402
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,820
uh,
I've tried to figure it out.

403
00:16:39,821 --> 00:16:40,060
The,
the,

404
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:40,601
the,
the,

405
00:16:40,601 --> 00:16:43,750
the easiest way to explain it I'd think
is that I just wanted to see if what I

406
00:16:43,751 --> 00:16:48,130
was writing was funny.
And so that's sort of why even when I

407
00:16:48,131 --> 00:16:50,530
started at me,
I'm still dead pan obviously,

408
00:16:50,531 --> 00:16:55,360
but when I started I was so dry because
I was essentially just reading out loud.

409
00:16:55,810 --> 00:17:00,280
These thoughts I have with no real
performance background and I wasn't,

410
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,920
you know,
necessarily a performer at heart.

411
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,320
Right.
So it's just like reading one liners and

412
00:17:05,321 --> 00:17:06,190
going,
is this funny?

413
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,330
Is this funny?
Is this funny?

414
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:08,860
Get a laugh.
Keep it.

415
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:09,970
Don't get a laugh,
throw it away.

416
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:14,320
But if you,
if you throw it away like you never know

417
00:17:14,321 --> 00:17:16,690
sometimes is it,
is it me?

418
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,940
Is it the way I'm delivering it?
Is this joke?

419
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,730
Is it a good idea?
But it's kind of,

420
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:22,220
it's done wrong.
Yeah.

421
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,100
And then at that time too,
you don't have the,

422
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:25,910
uh,
you don't have the,

423
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,740
the,
the ability to perform at a hundred

424
00:17:27,741 --> 00:17:29,170
different places so you're not going,
okay.

425
00:17:29,171 --> 00:17:33,070
It works in the alternative room.
It doesn't work at the club or it's just

426
00:17:33,071 --> 00:17:33,461
like,
oh,

427
00:17:33,461 --> 00:17:36,430
well it didn't work at the laundry mat,
but it worked at the coffee house.

428
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,310
I wonder what that means about this
joke.

429
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,440
Right?
It's like jokes,

430
00:17:40,441 --> 00:17:43,350
it'll work at the UCB,
but they bomb on the store.

431
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,660
Yeah.
Like why,

432
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,240
what's going on?
Like why did that get an applause break

433
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,760
at the UCB?
They just fuck it.

434
00:17:49,761 --> 00:17:50,220
Stared

435
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,570
at me in the main room
following rick and Grub,

436
00:17:54,571 --> 00:17:57,310
they just stared at you.
Sometimes at UCB is hot.

437
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,370
I mean that's just anywhere that comes
out of your mouth.

438
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,840
It's weird.
And then sometimes,

439
00:18:00,841 --> 00:18:02,970
nope,
it's a weird place.

440
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,680
It's weird.
They don't pay too.

441
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:07,200
That's also super weird.
Yeah.

442
00:18:07,201 --> 00:18:07,990
I think if I was,
I,

443
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,250
I'd be a little,
uh,

444
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,700
less,
I might even that upset,

445
00:18:10,701 --> 00:18:13,290
not upset about it,
but I feel like I'd be less upset if I

446
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,510
was like involved in the school and
realize that it's,

447
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,970
oh,
it's so kids can take classes at like a

448
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,020
decent rate,
I think.

449
00:18:19,021 --> 00:18:21,570
Isn't that what it's for?
So that kids can take really cheap

450
00:18:21,571 --> 00:18:24,210
classes there.
Isn't that what it sustains?

451
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,530
Like the,
the shows,

452
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:28,440
what kind of classes do they have?
Like comedy classes,

453
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,360
Improv and shit.
Oh,

454
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,700
can you teach?
Well maybe you can teach improv.

455
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:35,160
Huh?
Do you believe you can teach stand up?

456
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,370
Uh,
I believe you can teach somebody.

457
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:42,240
Uh,
I think you can help somebody,

458
00:18:42,241 --> 00:18:43,830
uh,
encourage them to get on stage.

459
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:47,940
But I don't think you can teach the the
ability to be funny.

460
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,100
No,
I don't know what,

461
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,350
you know,
it stand up in what capacity?

462
00:18:52,351 --> 00:18:54,240
Like I guess you could teach somebody
to,

463
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:59,940
you can mold their thoughts into jokes
and help them and shove them on stage,

464
00:18:59,941 --> 00:19:02,370
but I don't know who,
what kind of comedian that makes.

465
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,760
Yeah,
I feel like boy,

466
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:08,070
it's one of those things where I've
learned a lot about it.

467
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:11,820
So I always wonder like maybe you can
teach something.

468
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,650
Cause I've definitely learned some shit.
Well,

469
00:19:13,651 --> 00:19:14,970
yeah mean people,
you know,

470
00:19:14,971 --> 00:19:18,660
I think there are,
if you find out your favorite comedian,

471
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,850
you know,
sits down and writes an hour a day at a

472
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,250
starbucks or whatever,
you go,

473
00:19:22,251 --> 00:19:23,160
oh maybe I'll try that.

474
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:27,210
Like little tricks and things like that.
But I don't know.

475
00:19:27,211 --> 00:19:29,400
I don't know anyone who's a,
you know,

476
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:32,010
who,
who I deeply,

477
00:19:32,011 --> 00:19:35,760
deeply admire who had credit all their
success to their comedy classes?

478
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,890
No.
Well there's not enough classes.

479
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:42,810
There'd be like a real poor focus group.
But I know Ari did an interesting thing

480
00:19:42,811 --> 00:19:47,811
while back where he used to go to a town
like when he was doing stand up and like

481
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:51,000
he was headlining for the weekend.
He would go to a town and you would do

482
00:19:51,001 --> 00:19:53,640
like a free seminar for the local
comics.

483
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:56,280
Tell them like desire,
you get a manager,

484
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,670
stop asking people to take you with them
on the road.

485
00:19:59,671 --> 00:20:03,150
When you're two months into comedy,
stop asking you know,

486
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:06,160
managers to handle you.
Like you just got to get good first and

487
00:20:06,161 --> 00:20:10,200
then give them all this advice about
like getting an agent and you know,

488
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:10,410
yeah.

489
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,071
I went,
uh,

490
00:20:11,071 --> 00:20:15,480
I went to Penn U Penn recently and I was
talking to uh,

491
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:18,600
some students and I don't,
I don't flake fancy myself,

492
00:20:18,601 --> 00:20:21,120
like an instructor of any kind,
but they were asking me,

493
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,760
you know,
about comedy writing,

494
00:20:23,761 --> 00:20:27,840
this is specifically in stuff.
And the advice I gave was very,

495
00:20:27,841 --> 00:20:29,850
uh,
practical and had nothing to do with the

496
00:20:29,851 --> 00:20:30,900
craft,
which was just like,

497
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,370
don't be annoying in the room.
Uh,

498
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,500
don't,
you know,

499
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,020
like in a TV,
like it did it like in the writing for

500
00:20:37,021 --> 00:20:39,060
like a TV show and like jokes don't
work,

501
00:20:39,061 --> 00:20:40,110
don't go,
that didn't work.

502
00:20:40,111 --> 00:20:43,110
That's not your job to say that.
Like that kind of shit of just like how

503
00:20:43,111 --> 00:20:46,170
to get through the first year without
annoying everybody dies.

504
00:20:46,171 --> 00:20:50,170
Think that's not taught right.
No one ever does that.

505
00:20:50,171 --> 00:20:52,480
Shut up.
Like shut up is a great rule.

506
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,340
You can make big mistakes.

507
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,530
Yeah.
And you can be a person that nobody

508
00:20:56,531 --> 00:20:58,960
wants to work with you then it doesn't
matter how talented you are.

509
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:02,200
Yeah.
That's a whole brighters oftentimes a

510
00:21:02,201 --> 00:21:03,250
very awkward,
right.

511
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,110
They can be,
it depends.

512
00:21:05,111 --> 00:21:08,290
Like the rooms are very split into when
I got into like Sitcom stuff,

513
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:12,790
like it's just very split into um,
very just internal,

514
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:15,910
uh,
kind of what you would typically think

515
00:21:15,911 --> 00:21:18,190
of as like a writer.
And then there's a couple of comedians

516
00:21:18,191 --> 00:21:20,890
sprinkled in there who kind of bounce
more jokes around.

517
00:21:20,891 --> 00:21:23,800
It's just a win and people who are just
good at structure.

518
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,770
Hmm.
Yeah.

519
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,610
That's an interesting thing that people
that are good at structure cause

520
00:21:30,611 --> 00:21:33,850
sometimes they try to be funny sometimes
but it's not,

521
00:21:33,851 --> 00:21:34,684
you know,
once you fight,

522
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:39,130
the thing I like about like those rooms,
obviously it's so much fun to be in a

523
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,740
room with Comedians,
but once you realize how that person can

524
00:21:41,741 --> 00:21:43,030
do anything,
I can't and I can do a thing,

525
00:21:43,031 --> 00:21:44,860
they can't,
you start to realize like,

526
00:21:44,861 --> 00:21:47,140
oh we could go into a room and get a lot
of work done together.

527
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,460
That is the thing,
right?

528
00:21:48,461 --> 00:21:52,600
It's like lining up the pieces and no
matter how much you want a square and a

529
00:21:52,601 --> 00:21:53,770
circle the line up,
they just,

530
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,400
they just don't seem to.
And when you have like a writer's room

531
00:21:57,401 --> 00:22:00,660
or anything like that,
I think a big part of it depends on just

532
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:04,000
the fortunate chemistry of all the
people coming to there.

533
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:06,340
Yeah.
And that first day where you show up if

534
00:22:06,341 --> 00:22:09,430
it's not your room and you haven't hired
anybody and you don't know who's there

535
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,870
is a terrifying because you show up and
you know,

536
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,700
you know,
within five minutes if this is going to

537
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:19,150
be a fun x number of months or if you're
just going to be trudging through,

538
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,280
what's the biggest shit show you ever
had to work on?

539
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:23,940
Um,
I,

540
00:22:23,941 --> 00:22:26,770
I,
I've had really like tremendously good

541
00:22:26,771 --> 00:22:30,220
luck as far as like just working with
friends and stuff on so many things.

542
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:35,220
But I worked on a award show once and
the boss basically didn't let me write

543
00:22:36,281 --> 00:22:38,920
jokes.
Like didn't they needed to hire a woman?

544
00:22:38,921 --> 00:22:42,040
And I guess I was recommended and a,
and he just,

545
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:42,851
he,
I was like,

546
00:22:42,851 --> 00:22:44,470
I'll take a stab at these jokes.
And he was like,

547
00:22:44,471 --> 00:22:44,681
no,
no,

548
00:22:44,681 --> 00:22:45,514
no.
Just write the,

549
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,510
the banter where it says like coming up
next is this person.

550
00:22:49,511 --> 00:22:51,130
And I was like,
like anyone can do that.

551
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,930
Literally wouldn't allow me to write
jokes.

552
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:58,300
So he got hired as a joke writer.
And then once you got there,

553
00:22:58,301 --> 00:23:00,430
he just wanted you to write narrative.
Just banter.

554
00:23:00,431 --> 00:23:01,264
It just like,
you know,

555
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:03,140
like is,
you know,

556
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,690
from the hangover and please welcome
him.

557
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,420
Deserves specific and that,
is that what they call it?

558
00:23:10,421 --> 00:23:12,130
They call it banter.
Like when you're riding things?

559
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:12,760
Yeah.
Well,

560
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,190
no,
I mean like that in my 20s or run on a

561
00:23:15,191 --> 00:23:16,120
lot of award shows.

562
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,950
So there's like the jokes that
monologue,

563
00:23:17,951 --> 00:23:20,590
all that stuff.
And then there's just the going out to

564
00:23:20,591 --> 00:23:22,870
commercial and come back and all that
stuff has to be written.

565
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:25,600
And sometimes they try to make it funny
and sometimes they don't.

566
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:28,120
But you can take it up,
break it up in terms of like,

567
00:23:28,121 --> 00:23:30,310
this is the,
these are the jokes,

568
00:23:30,311 --> 00:23:32,380
this is the banter,
this is the narrative.

569
00:23:32,381 --> 00:23:34,060
This is the structure.
Yeah.

570
00:23:34,061 --> 00:23:34,781
The last,
I mean,

571
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:37,510
I was just writing on the NBA awards
that are going to be on,

572
00:23:37,511 --> 00:23:40,720
and I'm getting a 26 of the of the
month.

573
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,820
Uh,
drake is hosting on TNT and it's just

574
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:43,420
like,
it's,

575
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:43,901
you know,
I mean,

576
00:23:43,901 --> 00:23:45,860
I brought it on ever written on the sbs
before is this,

577
00:23:45,861 --> 00:23:46,100
is like

578
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,460
that.
But for just MBA and we've been doing,

579
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,590
you know,
it's a combination of like,

580
00:23:51,591 --> 00:23:53,810
I read a lot of monologue jokes.
There's other guys who are better at

581
00:23:53,811 --> 00:23:55,910
sketches,
like light film sketches,

582
00:23:55,911 --> 00:24:00,170
tape pieces,
there's live comedy stuff on stage.

583
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,490
Then there's,
you know,

584
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,160
like I said,
like the kind of a little more boring,

585
00:24:04,161 --> 00:24:06,560
like this next person a is the,
you know,

586
00:24:06,561 --> 00:24:08,030
two time mvp.

587
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:11,260
So why this guy hire you?
You really think he hard to just cause

588
00:24:11,261 --> 00:24:12,250
you needed a woman.
Yeah.

589
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,030
Wow.

590
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,110
Yeah,
I know he did.

591
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:17,830
That's so crazy.
Yeah,

592
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,210
I knew it all.
I knew it all when it was happening.

593
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,100
Yeah.
Ooh,

594
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,360
that was willing to let you try.
No,

595
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,040
that's fine.
That's foolish.

596
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:25,911
Yeah,
it was,

597
00:24:25,911 --> 00:24:27,260
it was bizarre.
And it was,

598
00:24:27,261 --> 00:24:29,420
it was the only case of,
uh,

599
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:30,530
like,
you know,

600
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,260
sexism that I think I've been confronted
with,

601
00:24:33,261 --> 00:24:33,891
which is,
I mean,

602
00:24:33,891 --> 00:24:36,050
I guess lucky in 15 years,
I don't feel like I've,

603
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:39,320
you know,
I've had that and I was on,

604
00:24:39,321 --> 00:24:42,320
I mean for years and years and years,
I'd never worked with another woman.

605
00:24:42,321 --> 00:24:44,900
I was the only girl and,
and everyone treated me great.

606
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:48,680
So it's a tougher road for comics to be
a woman.

607
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,150
Yeah.
I can't,

608
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,920
I mean,
it's so funny now.

609
00:24:51,921 --> 00:24:55,010
I,
it's so hard to the landscape right now.

610
00:24:55,011 --> 00:24:59,210
I think so many women are being given
chances that didn't even exist 10 years

611
00:24:59,211 --> 00:24:59,940
ago.
Yeah.

612
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,180
So it's,
it's interesting to,

613
00:25:02,181 --> 00:25:03,710
uh,
to see,

614
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:06,080
but I never had,
I don't know,

615
00:25:06,081 --> 00:25:08,590
I never had like,
uh,

616
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:11,090
those kind of sexist roadblocks,
if that makes sense.

617
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,140
Well,
I think that like starting and

618
00:25:14,141 --> 00:25:17,950
developing as a female,
it's more difficult just from my

619
00:25:17,951 --> 00:25:21,370
personal observations because men a lot
of times don't want to laugh at women.

620
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,940
They definitely don't want to laugh at
women telling them things about like

621
00:25:24,941 --> 00:25:26,990
politics or world events.
Right.

622
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:29,830
Like a woman that seems informed,
like for whatever reason they'll

623
00:25:29,831 --> 00:25:32,320
tolerate a guys,
especially if it's a guy like Ron White,

624
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,970
right?
Distinguished looking gentleman with

625
00:25:33,971 --> 00:25:35,140
silver hair.
Absolutely.

626
00:25:35,141 --> 00:25:38,350
One of my favorite voice.
If Ron's up there and he tells people

627
00:25:38,351 --> 00:25:43,180
something about some sort of a fact,
like people will sit back and listen.

628
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:44,200
Oh,
I didn't know that.

629
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:49,230
If a woman gets onstage and tells a man
or a group of men about a fact that it's

630
00:25:50,411 --> 00:25:52,000
very rare that they're going to go,
wow,

631
00:25:52,001 --> 00:25:53,920
I didn't know that.
That's amazing that what the fuck does

632
00:25:53,921 --> 00:25:55,780
this bitch now?
Right?

633
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:57,470
So there's that.
There's that,

634
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,780
that's a,
that's a roadblock.

635
00:25:58,781 --> 00:26:01,090
And then the other roadblock is,
um,

636
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:05,410
well there's a lot like you can do sex
jokes now.

637
00:26:05,411 --> 00:26:08,670
Obviously Sarah Silverman kind of broke
a lot of that downward.

638
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,890
So much of her was just straight dirty
and hilarious.

639
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,590
And then Amy Schumer of course,
and a lot of the people,

640
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,780
but it's still,
when you're developing,

641
00:26:16,781 --> 00:26:18,790
when you're coming,
let me starting out.

642
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:21,880
It's like more,
it seems like it's more of a difficult

643
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:26,170
world to navigate then a guy telling sex
jokes.

644
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:26,711
Yeah,
it's,

645
00:26:26,711 --> 00:26:27,780
it's,
it's a difficult world.

646
00:26:27,781 --> 00:26:29,370
And it's also like socially,
it's,

647
00:26:29,371 --> 00:26:30,330
uh,
it's,

648
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,390
it's,
I think the precarious,

649
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,980
it's interesting because what I realized
when I was,

650
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:40,650
you know,
1920 was,

651
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,500
you know,
you like that,

652
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:44,220
that aspect

653
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,770
of people like dating in the scene and
all that kind of stuff.

654
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:51,771
All that happened too.
And I've found that if a woman who was

655
00:26:52,231 --> 00:26:56,070
new ish around,
like my level of time was dating

656
00:26:56,071 --> 00:26:59,070
somebody else,
they were automatically looked at as

657
00:26:59,071 --> 00:27:02,250
like a comedy groupie.
And that was the thing that didn't apply

658
00:27:02,251 --> 00:27:04,230
to men.
That was the one part where I was like,

659
00:27:04,231 --> 00:27:06,290
I don't,
I don't quite get that guy.

660
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:09,120
Not totally true.
Because I've seen some guys that are

661
00:27:09,121 --> 00:27:13,410
dating like famous women and they're
sort of like underlying sort of men

662
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:17,220
shored up comics and everybody treats
them like they're a comedy group.

663
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:19,890
I found her,
saw that a lot when I was,

664
00:27:19,891 --> 00:27:22,350
when I was younger that the opposite
where it just,

665
00:27:22,351 --> 00:27:24,330
I didn't see men getting tagged with
that.

666
00:27:24,331 --> 00:27:26,040
Uh,
but that label and that,

667
00:27:26,041 --> 00:27:28,560
but that I was so scared and paranoid of
being,

668
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,580
I was,
I was so scared of being considered

669
00:27:32,581 --> 00:27:36,330
anything other than a comedian that I
like for years and years.

670
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:38,910
Didn't date anybody,
uh,

671
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,670
in,
in comedy at all because I was worried

672
00:27:41,671 --> 00:27:45,270
that if I showed up to a show with a guy
who,

673
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,310
you know,
potentially it was more successful than

674
00:27:47,311 --> 00:27:49,890
me,
then the first thought would be she's

675
00:27:49,891 --> 00:27:52,980
the girl who's with that guy,
not she's the girl who's going up next,

676
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:56,340
not just dod,
but she's with that God because of this.

677
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:00,090
She thinks always going to be the path
when in fact there's a lot of people who

678
00:28:00,091 --> 00:28:02,830
have legitimate relationships that where
that's not the path that just you need

679
00:28:02,831 --> 00:28:04,740
to treat.
You're attracted to somebody and you

680
00:28:04,741 --> 00:28:05,574
know,
eventually I,

681
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,740
you know,
I made my way through a few people.

682
00:28:07,741 --> 00:28:10,410
It's just another prejudiced.
It's just one of those things.

683
00:28:10,411 --> 00:28:13,350
Another prejudice that you have to sort
of overcome.

684
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,480
Like you,
if you'll actually liked someone and

685
00:28:15,481 --> 00:28:18,000
they happen to be comic though,
what the fuck do you do?

686
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,400
Like you say,
if you like someone and they happen to

687
00:28:20,401 --> 00:28:22,590
be some big time comedian,
like what are you supposed to do?

688
00:28:22,591 --> 00:28:24,240
Not like them now.
And they're like,

689
00:28:24,241 --> 00:28:25,740
you look at it,
not like them.

690
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,510
That's stupid too.
It is stupid.

691
00:28:27,511 --> 00:28:28,740
But I was,
I was a,

692
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:31,350
I was terrified of,
uh,

693
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:32,663
I don't know.
I just,

694
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:35,550
I think it was very eager to,
um,

695
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,360
to improve.
Impress.

696
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,660
I don't know.
I was very eager to prove myself.

697
00:28:39,661 --> 00:28:43,200
And maybe that is partly,
you know,

698
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,140
being a woman.
I,

699
00:28:45,141 --> 00:28:50,141
as much as I didn't find it harder,
I did find myself wanting to prove any

700
00:28:51,301 --> 00:28:53,910
stereotype that anyone might have about
me wrong.

701
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:56,850
I don't,
I don't feel as much of that as like a

702
00:28:56,851 --> 00:28:59,100
mission anymore.
I just who I am.

703
00:28:59,101 --> 00:29:02,490
But I think you have a lot wrapped into
your head when you're young end.

704
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:06,030
Especially when you're just,
you really aren't stable as far as like

705
00:29:06,031 --> 00:29:06,811
financial.
You're not,

706
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:09,440
you're really not a real professional
anymore or yet.

707
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:11,370
Yeah.
And then once you become one lins,

708
00:29:11,371 --> 00:29:12,980
once you're established in the
community,

709
00:29:12,981 --> 00:29:14,490
knew after a while it's like,
what am I,

710
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,890
what am I wasting my time and I'm
thinking about this shit for.

711
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,400
So I think it's harder for chicks to
develop,

712
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:24,760
but I think once they become good and
once they get out there,

713
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,010
there's a lower bar.

714
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,170
I don't know,
I think there's,

715
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:36,770
I think the bar is the same.
I think the bar is the same height,

716
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,710
uh,
for most good people.

717
00:29:41,711 --> 00:29:45,130
And then there's like another bar that's
higher for the great,

718
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,930
you know what I mean?
I just think like,

719
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,700
I don't think the bar is lower for
women.

720
00:29:48,701 --> 00:29:52,810
I think it's lower for people who are
not as famous,

721
00:29:52,811 --> 00:29:54,640
not as successful,
not as established,

722
00:29:54,641 --> 00:29:58,260
not as good,
but I don't know if that,

723
00:29:58,261 --> 00:29:59,130
like,
I just,

724
00:29:59,131 --> 00:29:59,941
I don't know.
I think it's,

725
00:29:59,941 --> 00:30:01,710
I think the bar is the same for men and
women.

726
00:30:01,711 --> 00:30:03,660
I just think it's a,
there's a code.

727
00:30:03,661 --> 00:30:04,770
There's a few different bars.

728
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:07,850
What I mean by that is that I think that
it's,

729
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,390
it's easier to get a lot of attention,
uh,

730
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:16,700
early on if you're good and you're a
woman because there's not that many of

731
00:30:16,701 --> 00:30:17,360
them.

732
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:17,781
Yeah,
sure.

733
00:30:17,781 --> 00:30:18,531
I think it's,
yeah,

734
00:30:18,531 --> 00:30:23,150
I mean I would,
I would apply that to any person whose

735
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:27,810
something that is rare in comedy,
like a specific little finality.

736
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:31,100
But then you have to prove yourself.
You always have to prove yourself.

737
00:30:31,101 --> 00:30:33,500
I mean,
and then I dunno,

738
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:35,150
I,
I see comedy too in these,

739
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,820
there's so many different factions.
Mean there's people who are so great at

740
00:30:37,821 --> 00:30:41,900
standup and then as a writer and
somebody who tries to make like,

741
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:44,390
you know,
projects and wrap them around people.

742
00:30:44,391 --> 00:30:47,510
I also see so many people who I though
that's not my favorite stand up.

743
00:30:47,511 --> 00:30:49,730
That's not a great standup in my
opinion.

744
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:52,010
But that's somebody I would love to
write for that.

745
00:30:52,011 --> 00:30:55,820
Somebody I'd love to put in a show like,
so I see all these like columns of

746
00:30:55,821 --> 00:30:58,280
comedians and I judged people
accordingly.

747
00:30:58,281 --> 00:31:01,280
And I think there are legitimately
comedians who are not like,

748
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:03,950
they're never going to be,
you know,

749
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:05,960
prior a Carlin or Louie or anybody like
that.

750
00:31:05,961 --> 00:31:06,920
But you go,
oh,

751
00:31:06,921 --> 00:31:09,200
I would,
I would put them in a hundred tv shows

752
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:10,900
as a funny person.
Oh yeah.

753
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:14,210
So I don't know,
I tend to like look at it from that

754
00:31:14,211 --> 00:31:15,680
perspective too,
where I see,

755
00:31:15,681 --> 00:31:20,360
I see the potential almost in spite of
the materials sometimes.

756
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,550
Well,
there's definitely that,

757
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:24,120
you know,
and there's also like the difference

758
00:31:24,121 --> 00:31:28,020
between those guys and the guys that are
in like funny movies like Adam Sandler

759
00:31:28,021 --> 00:31:29,160
type movies.
So sure.

760
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:32,550
It's got a gang of those guys that are
always in those movies and they might

761
00:31:32,551 --> 00:31:35,670
not necessarily be the best standups are
the kind of guys you want to see.

762
00:31:35,671 --> 00:31:37,440
But they're great in those movies.

763
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:38,341
Yeah.
I mean,

764
00:31:38,341 --> 00:31:39,570
and then it,
but it's,

765
00:31:39,571 --> 00:31:40,440
it's,
I mean,

766
00:31:40,441 --> 00:31:41,670
who's,
I don't know in that,

767
00:31:41,671 --> 00:31:43,890
in that group,
like my favorite standup is probably

768
00:31:43,891 --> 00:31:46,590
norm who,
I mean I went to go see the,

769
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:49,460
they did a netflix movie and then I like
a tour with all the actor,

770
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:51,810
you know,
the comedians from it and it couldn't

771
00:31:51,811 --> 00:31:54,210
have been a bit different group of
Comedians and you go,

772
00:31:54,211 --> 00:31:55,020
okay,
well norms.

773
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,240
My favorite stand up there and I go is
norm,

774
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:00,690
you know,
going to be the lead of like,

775
00:32:00,691 --> 00:32:01,110
uh,
uh,

776
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,100
you know,
Adam Sandler movie?

777
00:32:02,101 --> 00:32:04,680
Probably not,
but he's the person I would go to.

778
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,000
Any theater,
any room,

779
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,110
any,
you know,

780
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,430
any,
any,

781
00:32:08,431 --> 00:32:10,350
a coffee house,
whatever it is to go see.

782
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:11,340
Yeah.
It's,

783
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,650
it's one of those things I guess

784
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,100
when you,
you,

785
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,430
you,
you look at,

786
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,430
you look at things in categories like
you know that Kevin Hart does his own

787
00:32:19,431 --> 00:32:21,170
standup,
but you also know that he does movies

788
00:32:21,171 --> 00:32:22,070
where the people,
right,

789
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:26,080
the lines and I'm sure you helps make
them funnier and all that stuff.

790
00:32:26,081 --> 00:32:27,920
And he's reading a script essentially.
Yeah.

791
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:33,100
And then there's people that go on stage
doing stand up and you,

792
00:32:34,371 --> 00:32:35,360
you know,
like you could be like,

793
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:40,160
I guess you could be like a really
amazing performer and just have some

794
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:45,160
wizards behind the scenes that right for
you and you could make a fucking

795
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,150
incredible standup act.

796
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:47,701
Yeah.
It's,

797
00:32:47,701 --> 00:32:49,370
it's,
that stuff's so interesting.

798
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:51,620
Yeah.
I have a very specific,

799
00:32:51,621 --> 00:32:53,000
like,
you know,

800
00:32:53,001 --> 00:32:54,800
if I was the boil down the standup that
I,

801
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,321
you know,
the,

802
00:32:55,321 --> 00:32:58,130
the standup comedy that I love and
respect the most,

803
00:32:58,131 --> 00:33:01,400
it has nothing to do with TV and has
nothing to do with

804
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:03,700
it has,
it's just comedians,

805
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,750
right.
Who they are on stage.

806
00:33:04,751 --> 00:33:06,130
And that's,
you know,

807
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:09,670
that's how I judge who I love and don't
love,

808
00:33:09,671 --> 00:33:10,630
uh,
uh,

809
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:12,360
as a comedian.
But there's

810
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:15,600
so many other factors in show business
that you have to sort of take into

811
00:33:15,601 --> 00:33:16,740
consideration.
I mean,

812
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:19,110
we like a lot of people who are very
famous,

813
00:33:19,111 --> 00:33:19,944
who might not be

814
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,860
the very best,
but we know them the most.

815
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:24,761
Right.
Well,

816
00:33:24,761 --> 00:33:26,380
what I was going to say is that when
you're,

817
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:29,500
when you're doing standup though,
for whatever weird reason,

818
00:33:29,501 --> 00:33:34,480
the people that we all love the most are
almost always people that like right for

819
00:33:34,481 --> 00:33:35,320
themselves.
Yeah.

820
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:38,890
And it's very difficult to get,
like say you're not going to get bill

821
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:43,810
burr to write for some ca creation,
like say FCA,

822
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:45,670
how's,
I'm fucking comic.

823
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:50,170
He's got perfect cheek bones and he's
got a great way of delivering jokes,

824
00:33:50,171 --> 00:33:52,330
but he's,
he's not capable of writing.

825
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:56,170
They're the right level of material.
Like one of the problems is a guy like

826
00:33:56,171 --> 00:33:58,160
Bert rights for his own mind,
right.

827
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:01,330
Rights for his own thing.
Like I'm sure he could write for that

828
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:02,500
guy,
but he's not going to get the best

829
00:34:02,501 --> 00:34:03,221
stuff.
Right.

830
00:34:03,221 --> 00:34:04,270
It's just not going to be the same.

831
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:05,291
I,
yeah,

832
00:34:05,291 --> 00:34:06,124
I mean I,
I'm,

833
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:07,480
I,
I've never,

834
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:11,320
I think we've all taken like a tag or a
segway or something where a friend goes,

835
00:34:11,321 --> 00:34:12,940
dude,
add this to your joke and you feel like

836
00:34:12,941 --> 00:34:15,130
you already wrote it.
I mean I look at three year fight with

837
00:34:15,131 --> 00:34:18,130
somebody in my twenties of her who wrote
a joke and I thought he did and he said

838
00:34:18,131 --> 00:34:22,090
I did in the car and I refuse to do it
until he convinced me that I came up

839
00:34:22,091 --> 00:34:24,580
with it.
Cause I was so paranoid about doing a

840
00:34:24,581 --> 00:34:27,490
joke that I thought somebody else wrote.
But yeah,

841
00:34:27,491 --> 00:34:28,990
I mean that's the thing too is that

842
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:31,880
there's some material that's so funny.

843
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:33,980
Fucking great.
And I watch it and I go,

844
00:34:33,981 --> 00:34:37,430
I don't know how to make that a show.
And maybe it doesn't even,

845
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,930
maybe it's not even supposed to be a
show,

846
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,450
but like someone like Louie,
I think,

847
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,270
I mean a repeat it and he says he's my
favorite.

848
00:34:44,271 --> 00:34:45,104
But like

849
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:48,820
I could have never written Louis show.
Louis had to write Louis show.

850
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,710
Right.
But there's a lot of comedians where I

851
00:34:50,711 --> 00:34:52,120
watched some and I go,
oh I know,

852
00:34:52,121 --> 00:34:54,550
I know what I know what they're showing
you how to figure that out though.

853
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:57,340
I'll absolutely like you Louie.
He did that show on Hbo.

854
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,930
Yeah,
I had a conversation with them after it

855
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:02,320
was canceled.
At the Improv and the first thing he

856
00:35:02,321 --> 00:35:03,101
said is,
I just,

857
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,930
I should have written it myself.
I would have fired everybody.

858
00:35:04,931 --> 00:35:06,250
Yeah.
And just written it.

859
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,810
He goes,
it's like the problem,

860
00:35:07,811 --> 00:35:10,480
a big part of it is just you're dealing
with all these people's visions and

861
00:35:10,481 --> 00:35:14,230
you're trying to get yours through and
it's like yours might not necessarily be

862
00:35:14,231 --> 00:35:17,230
better,
but the problem is it's yours.

863
00:35:17,231 --> 00:35:19,630
And in order for,
for the thing to be the thing that

864
00:35:19,631 --> 00:35:22,180
you're happy with,
like just like your act,

865
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:24,250
it kind of has to come through.
You like Save,

866
00:35:24,251 --> 00:35:25,780
you were going to do a Netflix special
and they said,

867
00:35:25,781 --> 00:35:27,100
look Morgan,
we think you're hilarious.

868
00:35:27,101 --> 00:35:28,810
We love to do a Netflix special with
you.

869
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:33,990
But what we'd like to do is assign a
team of executive producers and writers

870
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,340
and with,
they're going to do is they're going to

871
00:35:36,341 --> 00:35:37,260
change your look.
Okay.

872
00:35:37,261 --> 00:35:38,470
We're going to go with a goth

873
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:41,440
theme.
We're going to put black lipstick on you

874
00:35:41,441 --> 00:35:43,190
and,
and we're gonna just w yeah.

875
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,750
They're going to come up with some
fucking nutty thing that they decided to

876
00:35:45,751 --> 00:35:48,690
do and then change the way you deliver
material.

877
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:49,930
It would be like,
what,

878
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:51,220
what are we doing here?
Right.

879
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:54,090
I think that's kind of how Louis felt
when he was doing a show.

880
00:35:54,091 --> 00:35:56,550
It's like all this,
there's all these other voices,

881
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:01,700
maybe not as retarded as a golf vampire
black lipstick I get.

882
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:07,820
So like I get so passionate about about
making things like other people's

883
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:11,010
things.
Like I just get excited.

884
00:36:11,011 --> 00:36:12,270
I see somebody on stage.
I'm like,

885
00:36:12,271 --> 00:36:13,320
I want to,
you know,

886
00:36:13,321 --> 00:36:16,770
like my job right now is just to develop
tv stuff and does it ever fucking

887
00:36:16,771 --> 00:36:19,800
happen?
Number two stand up to still stan hope.

888
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:22,960
Yeah,
we're going on tour for two weeks on a

889
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:23,873
Tuesday.

890
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,280
Um,
and then he continues and I have to come

891
00:36:26,281 --> 00:36:29,400
back for some writing shit and,
but I get,

892
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,310
you know,
as passionate as I get about standup,

893
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:35,550
I get so fucking into the idea of like
seeing somebody go up,

894
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:41,270
seen the show that they could have and
also wanting them to love it because I'm

895
00:36:43,291 --> 00:36:43,591
like,
no,

896
00:36:43,591 --> 00:36:43,831
no,
no,

897
00:36:43,831 --> 00:36:47,460
I get you.
I'm not going to write anything that you

898
00:36:47,461 --> 00:36:50,730
would say that you wouldn't do.
Like you want to be as the writer.

899
00:36:50,731 --> 00:36:54,330
On the other side of that,
as the person who is sometimes hired to

900
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:57,390
take a comedian and like get a show out
of them.

901
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:02,740
Like I liked to hope and think that I
have a perspective that someone who's

902
00:37:03,091 --> 00:37:06,000
not in standup maybe wouldn't have.
Because I'm like,

903
00:37:06,001 --> 00:37:07,920
I,
I've watched this person so long,

904
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:11,340
I know their voice,
I know what they're commenting on,

905
00:37:11,341 --> 00:37:12,720
I know the way they're commenting on it.

906
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,930
And I hope that if I write a script for
them and they read it,

907
00:37:15,931 --> 00:37:16,711
they're not going to go,
fuck,

908
00:37:16,711 --> 00:37:18,210
this isn't me.
You know,

909
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,430
I'm so,
I mean I'd,

910
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,080
maybe it goes back to like wanting to
and press or wanting,

911
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:24,270
you know,
to be seen as legitimate,

912
00:37:24,271 --> 00:37:27,300
but I would never,
I would never hand somebody something if

913
00:37:27,301 --> 00:37:29,820
I thought that it was remotely
embarrassing her against their,

914
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,760
you know,
there's a lot of people will.

915
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,811
Right.
But I mean,

916
00:37:33,811 --> 00:37:35,880
I,
I find it to be an interesting sort of

917
00:37:35,881 --> 00:37:37,440
responsibility and,
and,

918
00:37:37,441 --> 00:37:41,100
and like when you're hired to sort of
develop shows is all this shit they

919
00:37:41,101 --> 00:37:42,450
bring you like,
Hey,

920
00:37:42,451 --> 00:37:44,550
there's an article about this.
Do you want to write a show about this

921
00:37:44,551 --> 00:37:45,120
thing?
And I'm like,

922
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,550
every time I say no,
I wanna I wanna write something for a

923
00:37:47,551 --> 00:37:48,400
comedian.
I,

924
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:50,460
that's,
so that's like your specialty is what

925
00:37:50,461 --> 00:37:51,060
you want to do.

926
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,990
It's what I wanna do.
I mean seeing,

927
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:56,430
watching someone from comedians
perspective and going,

928
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:57,780
Oh,
I could do something with that.

929
00:37:57,930 --> 00:37:59,450
Yeah.
And also like I,

930
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,040
Tim Allen,
that I think that there's so many

931
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:03,270
people,
you see where you go,

932
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,490
I,
they're not as successful as I think

933
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:10,491
they should be.
And I think I know how to,

934
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:12,990
how to fix it.
Fix it to your cleaner.

935
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:14,850
I'm a clean,
you're a cleaner,

936
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,980
right?
You're the person they bring in.

937
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:20,370
Ah,
that would be the like,

938
00:38:20,371 --> 00:38:21,091
uh,
the,

939
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:22,050
uh,
you know,

940
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:23,970
the,
the wolf and a pulp fiction.

941
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,860
Yeah.
You have a harvey cartel character pulls

942
00:38:25,861 --> 00:38:28,980
up in a silver NSX and it takes notes.
Sound like,

943
00:38:28,981 --> 00:38:30,840
hey,
any show where it's like a woman's job

944
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:35,870
is to clean and then coming in cleaner
you like waiters on,

945
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:38,410
cause you're always fucking stepping
through.

946
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:42,460
It actually is like mildly embarrassing
to passionately talk about,

947
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,860
uh,
television and show business.

948
00:38:44,861 --> 00:38:45,371
Like it's,
it's,

949
00:38:45,371 --> 00:38:47,050
it's,
there's a little part of it that's like,

950
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:48,850
Oh,
who cares and why does it matter?

951
00:38:48,851 --> 00:38:51,380
But I don't know.
Listen,

952
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:54,670
I think anything that's interesting to
you should talk about and people say,

953
00:38:54,671 --> 00:38:55,361
well,
you know,

954
00:38:55,361 --> 00:38:56,620
you're going to bore the fuck out of
people.

955
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:58,510
You are,
you're going to bore the fuck out of

956
00:38:58,511 --> 00:39:00,040
some people,
but you're going to bore the fuck out of

957
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:01,870
some people with things that I think are
really interesting.

958
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:07,150
Whatever physics,
nature things that I think are

959
00:39:07,151 --> 00:39:09,160
fascinating.
Some people are gonna think of stupid

960
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:11,550
just so you have to,
whatever's interesting standups.

961
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,240
Interesting to us.
It's always going to be,

962
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:15,850
I hadn't,
I'm into anything that is passionately

963
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,250
and intricately discussed.
You know,

964
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:19,440
I'm interesting shit.

965
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,790
If it's a,
if I'm a,

966
00:39:21,791 --> 00:39:24,640
as the Sam,
I knew him in an enthusiast enthusiast.

967
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:28,240
I don't know a lot about one thing,
but I love anybody who does.

968
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:29,710
Yeah.
I'm with you.

969
00:39:29,711 --> 00:39:31,870
I'm 100% with you.
I liked a lot of cool shit.

970
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:33,610
There's a lot of interesting shit out
there.

971
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,250
There's so much anybody tells me they're
bored.

972
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,870
I'm like,
listen,

973
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:40,450
you're not bored.
You're inactive.

974
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:43,870
You just need to find things that you
enjoy doing and then you will never be

975
00:39:43,871 --> 00:39:46,510
bored.
Just keep doing things you like doing.

976
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:50,740
It's just hard for people to get that
initial momentum.

977
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:54,040
Just get moving.
Go forward.

978
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:57,070
Sure.
It's not boring.

979
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:58,960
This is not boring.
This is crazy.

980
00:39:58,961 --> 00:40:02,230
You are finite life form on a planet.
It's whole thing's crazy.

981
00:40:02,231 --> 00:40:04,840
It's chaos.
I got scared as fuck the other day.

982
00:40:04,841 --> 00:40:06,400
I saw another article,
and yellowstone,

983
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:09,850
they're saying it's a 10% chance and
inside this hundred years,

984
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:12,040
who's going to be a super volcano
eruption?

985
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:15,760
So inside this from 2000 to three,
you know,

986
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:20,560
2000 to 2,100,
there's a 10% chance that everything

987
00:40:20,561 --> 00:40:22,270
dies.
The whole planet,

988
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,880
everything on this continent dead,
everything else,

989
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:27,940
all over the rest of the world is going
to be fucked because there's not gonna

990
00:40:27,941 --> 00:40:30,270
be any son.
I got a book,

991
00:40:30,271 --> 00:40:32,370
some Glasgow dates.
That's the move.

992
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:35,090
So I think South Africa,
yeah,

993
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,060
it might be.
The New Zealand is a,

994
00:40:37,061 --> 00:40:40,270
is a big one for people escaping the APP
apocalypse.

995
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,370
New Zealand's awesome.
I know a lot of Americans,

996
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,533
a lot of,
uh,

997
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:45,400
you know,
tech people,

998
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,800
big,
big money buying land in New Zealand and

999
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:51,850
it's beautiful.
I want to yellowstone supervolcano hit

1000
00:40:51,851 --> 00:40:55,780
by a swarm of more than 230 earthquakes
in one week.

1001
00:40:56,140 --> 00:41:00,310
What in the fuck people,
how many wake up calls do we need?

1002
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:02,260
See,
we're not going to be even paying

1003
00:41:02,261 --> 00:41:05,920
attention to this until the lava is
shooting up into the atmosphere.

1004
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:08,920
Do you know?
They didn't even know that it was a

1005
00:41:08,921 --> 00:41:11,440
super volcano until like 50 years ago or
something.

1006
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,440
They didn't even know this is,
I like this pocket that you just,

1007
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:17,020
it's just a talk about shit and learn
how you'll die.

1008
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,930
Not always.
Sometimes weren't learn about beautiful

1009
00:41:19,931 --> 00:41:21,380
things.
Scared now though,

1010
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:23,100
like vibram five fingers,
toes,

1011
00:41:23,101 --> 00:41:26,610
shoes and boxing matches.
This is those things like that that are

1012
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,810
why I'm like,
why would I quit smoking when I can just

1013
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:30,213
wait it out.

1014
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:35,690
See what you're,
but don't you feel like shit when you

1015
00:41:35,691 --> 00:41:36,524
smoke a lot?

1016
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,490
Uh,
when I smoke a lot.

1017
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,220
How often do you smoke?
Do you smoke a day?

1018
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,200
Half a pack.
It's not that bad.

1019
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,200
I mean,
right now,

1020
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:45,330
but it gets crazy when,
when I,

1021
00:41:45,331 --> 00:41:46,860
when I have deadlines and stuff and I'm
writing,

1022
00:41:46,861 --> 00:41:48,360
I tied it into writing,
which is a bad,

1023
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:51,430
how does that work?
Does the eye,

1024
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,620
I've smoked Tony Hinchcliffe cigarettes.
Yeah.

1025
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:55,850
I smoked a cigarette with him before a
show wants and I was like,

1026
00:41:55,851 --> 00:41:57,480
dude just gives you like a buzz.
Yeah.

1027
00:41:57,481 --> 00:41:57,921
And he goes,
yeah,

1028
00:41:57,921 --> 00:42:01,250
I can't imagine writing or doing standup
without it.

1029
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:02,383
No,
really.

1030
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,620
My Dad's interesting.

1031
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:04,730
Yeah.
I've gone over to hinge.

1032
00:42:04,731 --> 00:42:05,410
Could wait,
wait,

1033
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:07,200
he's a go hang out with it.
Cause a,

1034
00:42:07,201 --> 00:42:08,070
you know,
similar,

1035
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,970
similar lifestyle I guess.
Is it easy to like a,

1036
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,620
have a cigarette with him and talk about
comedy?

1037
00:42:13,621 --> 00:42:14,230
Both.
Okay.

1038
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:15,063
So what you're saying

1039
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:19,690
presumed,
presumed to be gay.

1040
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:21,730
Not,
that's hilarious.

1041
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,730
Um,
but what is the thing about writing and

1042
00:42:24,731 --> 00:42:26,410
cigarettes?
Like what does it do and what does it do

1043
00:42:26,411 --> 00:42:28,540
that like a cigar doesn't do,
I don't know.

1044
00:42:28,541 --> 00:42:29,380
It's uh,
it,

1045
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,010
it,
it,

1046
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:30,843
there's,

1047
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:33,090
it ties into,
uh,

1048
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:33,751
it's a,
it's a,

1049
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:38,010
it feels good and then there's momentum
sort of involved.

1050
00:42:38,011 --> 00:42:39,750
And then you get into a place where
you're like,

1051
00:42:39,751 --> 00:42:40,584
Oh shit,
I'm,

1052
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:43,260
you know,
in one cigarette I wrote all those

1053
00:42:43,261 --> 00:42:43,790
pages.
I don't,

1054
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:44,940
I don't know.
I mean,

1055
00:42:44,941 --> 00:42:48,540
I really don't know chemically how the
addiction part of it works,

1056
00:42:48,541 --> 00:42:50,730
but I know I,
uh,

1057
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:53,000
I'm a victim of it.
Yeah.

1058
00:42:53,001 --> 00:42:54,110
We'll,
the addiction part is,

1059
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,710
um,
pretty clearly documented in that movie.

1060
00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:01,520
Um,
with what the fuck's his name inside

1061
00:43:01,521 --> 00:43:04,280
man.
Guy from gladiator,

1062
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:06,830
Russell cider.
What the fuck?

1063
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:07,880
Yeah,
the insider inside.

1064
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,290
Yeah.
Inside man's different movie.

1065
00:43:09,291 --> 00:43:09,740
Right?
Yeah.

1066
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:12,380
What the fuck's his name?
Let's try and do grow by surprise or

1067
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:13,430
Crowe.
Gladiator.

1068
00:43:13,431 --> 00:43:14,450
Dude,
that guy,

1069
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,470
he was young.
I didn't see it.

1070
00:43:15,471 --> 00:43:16,520
I think,
I don't want to know.

1071
00:43:16,521 --> 00:43:19,250
I think I liked Christina.
She's a scientist in the movie.

1072
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,450
Yeah.
And they're trying to kill him cause

1073
00:43:20,451 --> 00:43:25,130
he's releasing all the information.
Apparently that's like hundreds and

1074
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:28,250
hundreds of different chemicals.
The FDA's approved cigarette companies

1075
00:43:28,251 --> 00:43:30,500
to add cigarettes just to get a more
addictive.

1076
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:31,640
Yeah.

1077
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,320
It's interesting too,
cause I'll have like a,

1078
00:43:33,321 --> 00:43:35,880
I'll put out a cigarette and a glass of
water or something and uh,

1079
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:39,590
and then I get nervous if the water
would tobacco and it touches my skin.

1080
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:41,570
Like I get paranoid,

1081
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:42,220
but I'm like,
I'll,

1082
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,710
I'll,
I'll literally inhale every chemical

1083
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:47,770
deep into my lungs,
into my veins,

1084
00:43:47,771 --> 00:43:49,870
but I get nervous about like touching
Nah,

1085
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:51,140
tobacco.
He water.

1086
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,610
That's so weird,
man.

1087
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:57,800
What is it about like maybe like
bringing it into your lungs?

1088
00:43:57,801 --> 00:44:00,050
You're not saying it so it doesn't freak
you out as much.

1089
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:03,620
There's a,
I never thought I could be in as much a

1090
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:06,260
sort of denial about something as I am
about smoking.

1091
00:44:06,261 --> 00:44:09,800
But I enjoy it a lot right now.
And I also started late.

1092
00:44:09,801 --> 00:44:11,390
I started late.
How old were you?

1093
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:15,260
I smoked real,
real casually through my twenties and

1094
00:44:15,261 --> 00:44:20,261
then I started a job at like 29 30.
I'm 35 and that's when I really started.

1095
00:44:21,621 --> 00:44:23,420
That's when I started smoking during the
day.

1096
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,430
Nene and smoking.
Oh,

1097
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:28,980
before that you would smoke at night.
Only smoke it like a party with a drink

1098
00:44:28,981 --> 00:44:32,190
or something.
And when did you notice that had crossed

1099
00:44:32,191 --> 00:44:35,180
over into a part of you?

1100
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:39,070
Um,
I think just a couple of years into a,

1101
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:44,210
I was writing on not two broke girls and
I was smoking at every possible break

1102
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:49,140
and it just started to pick up where any
opportunity to go outside and smoke.

1103
00:44:49,141 --> 00:44:51,630
I,
I took and then I couldn't stop.

1104
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:55,530
Yeah.
I hate to be that proselytizing health

1105
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:57,420
guy.
You ever tried dip?

1106
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:58,410
That'd be a good,
uh,

1107
00:44:58,410 --> 00:44:58,820
no.
I,

1108
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:00,660
I'm gonna I want to try some stuff.
I just,

1109
00:45:00,661 --> 00:45:01,431
you know,
I want to try it.

1110
00:45:01,431 --> 00:45:03,000
Like I can't even,
I'm not even allowed to like,

1111
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,250
you know,
I'm on a lot of like antidepressants and

1112
00:45:05,251 --> 00:45:06,540
stuff,
so they don't want me to take the,

1113
00:45:06,541 --> 00:45:10,440
uh,
the medication that helps you stop or

1114
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:13,940
any of the gums and it's all supposed to
fuck up your brain chemicals.

1115
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:14,850
Oh really?
Yeah.

1116
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:17,340
Have Weird.
You're on a lot of antidepressants.

1117
00:45:17,341 --> 00:45:18,061
I mean,
I'm on a,

1118
00:45:18,061 --> 00:45:18,600
I'm on,
uh,

1119
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:21,900
uh,
talk about happy hour cocktail while I'm

1120
00:45:21,901 --> 00:45:22,734
smoking weed.

1121
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:24,841
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna,

1122
00:45:24,841 --> 00:45:25,674
I'm gonna,
uh,

1123
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:26,913
uh,
nice,

1124
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:28,140
uh,
you know,

1125
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:31,410
cocktail of,
of stuff stuff.

1126
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,050
What is the stuff?
Um,

1127
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,810
right now,
what am I like a sir?

1128
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:39,090
It's like kind of the main,
you know,

1129
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:41,220
I'm,
things are sort of dabbled in there.

1130
00:45:41,221 --> 00:45:44,340
It just,
it depends on the timing you get on

1131
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:45,780
different things,
different times of year

1132
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:50,940
in Somerville Inland,
almost 20 years of being on stuff.

1133
00:45:50,941 --> 00:45:51,660
I've,
uh,

1134
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:54,300
I've,
I've been switched around a few times to

1135
00:45:54,301 --> 00:45:55,920
20 years.
She started in high school.

1136
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:59,640
Yeah.
Henry Rollins got put on a real life in

1137
00:45:59,641 --> 00:46:00,930
high school.
I'm sure.

1138
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:02,290
100%.
Like,

1139
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:02,821
not,
yeah,

1140
00:46:02,821 --> 00:46:04,080
I mean it was where the,
uh,

1141
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:05,820
the term,
I mean I,

1142
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,310
I've had a couple of instances of I
don't want to do this anymore.

1143
00:46:08,311 --> 00:46:11,370
I don't want to be on it anymore.
I tried to go off and realize I needed

1144
00:46:11,371 --> 00:46:12,091
it,
but you know,

1145
00:46:12,091 --> 00:46:14,730
high school was the biggest turnaround.
John 80,

1146
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,560
the stress of,
I don't know,

1147
00:46:16,561 --> 00:46:18,750
I was a,
I was just a mess and uh,

1148
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,250
and then some doctor,
you know,

1149
00:46:20,251 --> 00:46:23,730
after a year of being a mass was like
try this and so you were suicidal?

1150
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:24,840
Uh,
yeah.

1151
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:27,130
Yeah.
16 you know,

1152
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,550
moved around every year.
It was just a,

1153
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,460
you know,
a chaotic that

1154
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:36,590
always fucks people up,
but it always creates interesting

1155
00:46:36,591 --> 00:46:39,800
people.
Everybody I know.

1156
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:42,800
That's interesting.
Had some sort of a weird childhood where

1157
00:46:42,801 --> 00:46:44,270
they moved around a lot.
By the way.

1158
00:46:44,271 --> 00:46:47,810
How annoying is it when someone starts
making a point while they're holding a

1159
00:46:47,811 --> 00:46:48,610
joint?

1160
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:50,930
A very important point I'm going to
make,

1161
00:46:50,931 --> 00:46:51,764
right?
Yeah.

1162
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:54,480
You also know you're not getting that
joint till the end of the point.

1163
00:46:54,481 --> 00:46:57,620
And you have to sit there like fixated
like a dog waiting for a treat,

1164
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,710
you know?
But yeah,

1165
00:47:00,711 --> 00:47:01,430
I moved,
uh,

1166
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:05,900
I lived with my mom until I was like pho
at 1415.

1167
00:47:05,901 --> 00:47:08,720
And then I lived with her sister and I
lived with my dad's sister and I live

1168
00:47:08,721 --> 00:47:11,900
with some family friends.
I live with my dad for the first time

1169
00:47:11,901 --> 00:47:14,480
when I was like 17,
and I just bounced around La,

1170
00:47:14,481 --> 00:47:17,120
Connecticut,
Oregon to use us and a,

1171
00:47:17,121 --> 00:47:18,140
and I was,
uh,

1172
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:21,230
just brutally depressed and couldn't,
you know,

1173
00:47:21,350 --> 00:47:23,990
I mean obviously there were big
environmental factors,

1174
00:47:23,991 --> 00:47:25,960
but at the end of the day,
it just,

1175
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:29,390
it was a more than more than therapy
institute.

1176
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:29,980
Your life was

1177
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,950
the plot of the movie.
Twilight never saw it.

1178
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:34,840
Should I see it?
Oh,

1179
00:47:34,841 --> 00:47:36,490
for sure.
It's classic.

1180
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,080
It is a classic now,
right?

1181
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:42,550
Twilight.
Twilight is a movie that was fucking

1182
00:47:42,551 --> 00:47:43,960
massive.
Yeah.

1183
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:47,980
Massive.
And now never discussed.

1184
00:47:48,550 --> 00:47:51,130
Never discussed,
not discussed at all.

1185
00:47:51,131 --> 00:47:54,970
Like people will talk about star wars to
the end of fucking time.

1186
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,700
No one's going to talk about twilight
and a couple of years.

1187
00:47:57,740 --> 00:47:59,110
No,
they're just not going to,

1188
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:02,500
or there might be like a 20 year reunion
where all the girls who watch it when

1189
00:48:02,501 --> 00:48:04,490
they were 13 go see it again.
Yes,

1190
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:05,920
sure.
But there's going to be a bunch of

1191
00:48:05,921 --> 00:48:08,230
people like what the fuck was wrong with
it?

1192
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:11,170
What did we do?
Like what happened as a culture?

1193
00:48:11,171 --> 00:48:12,850
What happened as a society?
Well,

1194
00:48:12,851 --> 00:48:16,180
we decided that all of a sudden vampires
allowed to go out in the day Werewolf's

1195
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,430
of abs.
They could change to a wolf,

1196
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,770
whatever the fuck they want.
Like what?

1197
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:22,600
What are you doing?
Wasn't there a lot of vampire shows for

1198
00:48:22,601 --> 00:48:24,860
a minute too or yeah,
they're all glad to,

1199
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:27,100
yes.
Everybody went crazy on vampires.

1200
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:31,150
Zam zombies are dead to me.
They're dead boring as fuck.

1201
00:48:31,151 --> 00:48:33,520
You try to put out a Zombie movie now.
Nobody gives a shit.

1202
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:34,781
I go,
I get it.

1203
00:48:34,781 --> 00:48:37,000
It's going to walk slow and you're going
to get away.

1204
00:48:37,001 --> 00:48:41,530
And the people that you really like real
live z boring

1205
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:44,360
like here's the a,
here's what the movie's about.

1206
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:46,040
It's,
they're not zombies.

1207
00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:47,600
Are you excited now?
Yes.

1208
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:48,080
Oh,
good.

1209
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:48,860
Yes.

1210
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:52,250
In the whole [inaudible] the movie is,
it's about a Gar and his daughter

1211
00:48:52,251 --> 00:48:54,210
becomes a Zombie.
He loves his daughter,

1212
00:48:54,211 --> 00:48:55,920
but chooses homepage.
Got It.

1213
00:48:56,690 --> 00:48:58,460
There's an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie
like that?

1214
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:00,170
No,
that was always a sad,

1215
00:49:00,171 --> 00:49:03,930
it's the saddest part of a walking dead
was when you realize like someone had

1216
00:49:03,931 --> 00:49:07,710
like their daughter chained up in a room
because he couldn't bring himself to,

1217
00:49:07,830 --> 00:49:09,570
you know,
put a spike through her head.

1218
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:12,120
So they just,
he just kept the Zombie daughter.

1219
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:17,380
Oof.
You know what's fucked up?

1220
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:22,420
That is not entirely impossible.
It's entirely impossible that the bodies

1221
00:49:22,421 --> 00:49:25,850
would stay active like long after
they're deteriorating minutes.

1222
00:49:25,851 --> 00:49:27,910
She has been going on for years.
These zombies have been alive,

1223
00:49:27,911 --> 00:49:30,010
eating nothing for your no digestive
track.

1224
00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:32,410
Somehow or another flush stays on their
bones.

1225
00:49:32,411 --> 00:49:34,210
Their tissue allows the body to keep
moving.

1226
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:35,410
It's ridiculous,
right?

1227
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:38,650
That they even have anything in their
brain at all that allows them to keep

1228
00:49:38,651 --> 00:49:41,950
moving.
But as far as like a disease that

1229
00:49:41,951 --> 00:49:45,070
changes the host and makes the whole
supervise,

1230
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:47,290
it's fucking rabies.
Rabies on steroids.

1231
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:50,830
Very possible,
very possible with you all the horrible

1232
00:49:50,831 --> 00:49:54,120
things that happened double like all
these different animals in terms of like

1233
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:57,170
parasites getting their system and
forced them to commit suicide and all

1234
00:49:57,171 --> 00:49:59,030
that.
You ever seen that aquatic worms one,

1235
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:03,490
it gets it to a grasshopper and then
talk the grasshopper and a jumping into

1236
00:50:03,491 --> 00:50:05,920
water and drowning so it could pop out
of its body.

1237
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:10,840
No develops in its body and then like
the alien and the movie alien,

1238
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:15,220
[inaudible] side of the chest literally
rips out of the things body in the water

1239
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:19,600
and then that's how it gets born,
like it gets into the grasshoppers body

1240
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:24,650
and then rewires the grasshoppers brain
when it's time to hatch and convinces

1241
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:28,520
this fuck to jump into the water.
It's the beauty of childbirth.

1242
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,710
It's walnut.
You can live,

1243
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,600
you can make a bunch of kids.
We have the Duggar's,

1244
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:36,170
well they have like 20 they're not a
single time they'd been drowned,

1245
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:39,290
but if you stop and think about that
being real,

1246
00:50:39,291 --> 00:50:44,291
like how weird is it?
The idea of a person becoming a Zombie,

1247
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:45,980
that's something that's not weird at
all.

1248
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:50,300
Are you becoming some super hyper
aggressive thing like a rabid dog that's

1249
00:50:50,301 --> 00:50:51,440
not,
we're not looking at this thing come out

1250
00:50:51,441 --> 00:50:55,690
of its body.
I don't like it grabs a out of money.

1251
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:57,440
This is,
this is horrific.

1252
00:50:57,470 --> 00:51:01,940
It's shooting and the grasshoppers just
gutted and this thing now is swimming

1253
00:51:01,941 --> 00:51:04,490
around in the water and there's a ton of
those.

1254
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:06,910
There's a ton of those.
There's something,

1255
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:08,810
one that happens with 'em

1256
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:14,380
aunts and a wasp.
I forget who takes over who,

1257
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:19,570
but there's,
there's got find that one is an aunts,

1258
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:23,950
I think I want to say that the ants take
over the wasp.

1259
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,220
Like a lot of them,
y'all,

1260
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:30,440
something happens with a rewire.
It sprays out of Bot fly.

1261
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:35,090
Oh Wolf or him coming out of rabbit.
Oh Jesus.

1262
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:37,610
That was one of the things in that
movie.

1263
00:51:37,611 --> 00:51:39,510
Rats.
Did you ever see that movie we were at?

1264
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:42,080
No,
but it looks like flex documentary.

1265
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:44,750
That thing's huge.
Holy Shit.

1266
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:48,230
That's a wolf form.
It looks like a grocer,

1267
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:52,130
like groundhog day thing.
It looks like the first two digits of

1268
00:51:52,131 --> 00:51:54,140
your pinky.
Like it's literally that big.

1269
00:51:54,141 --> 00:51:55,490
Right?
It came out of a rabbit.

1270
00:51:57,230 --> 00:51:57,950
Um,
but uh,

1271
00:51:57,950 --> 00:52:01,460
they uh,
that documentary on Netflix rats was all

1272
00:52:01,461 --> 00:52:04,700
about how many rats live in like New
York City and urban areas.

1273
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:08,570
Fucking insane documentary.
I can't recommend it enough.

1274
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:11,120
Like I always kind of knew there was a
lot of rats in New York.

1275
00:52:11,121 --> 00:52:12,050
Yeah,
it was here the numbers.

1276
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:15,710
But when you see like guys who are
exterminators are people who work with

1277
00:52:15,711 --> 00:52:20,090
rats and they go down in the basement,
it's like there is an underbelly to New

1278
00:52:20,090 --> 00:52:25,090
York City and a lot of other cities to
Los Angeles for sure where swarms of

1279
00:52:25,501 --> 00:52:30,501
rodents are underneath the city swarms
more than there are people probably that

1280
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:32,780
there's no way for them to count.

1281
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:35,900
They do rough estimates.
They really have no idea.

1282
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:39,500
But you see them everywhere.
They've got cameras that are dipped into

1283
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:42,920
probes and they're smart as shit.
But one of them are this Bot fly and

1284
00:52:42,921 --> 00:52:44,720
they pulled this bot fly out of its
body.

1285
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:47,300
It's like if you were carrying a
football and one of your tits,

1286
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:50,270
like literally just the pull this thing
out of its body.

1287
00:52:50,271 --> 00:52:51,770
It pulled it out of its neck.
Actually.

1288
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:55,190
It's fucking huge.
It's like as big as its neck almost.

1289
00:52:55,990 --> 00:52:57,400
I'm not into,
I'm not,

1290
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:58,131
I'm not,
I'm a,

1291
00:52:58,131 --> 00:53:01,670
I'm a real a morel pussy when it comes
to bugs and you should be,

1292
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:02,960
they're terrifying.
They're the worst.

1293
00:53:02,961 --> 00:53:06,230
I saw a spider a in Arizona last week.
That was,

1294
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:08,230
I mean it was half my fist.
I was like,

1295
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:11,060
I had a exos shell,
like a skit.

1296
00:53:11,061 --> 00:53:12,740
Like it didn't look like it was wearing
armor.

1297
00:53:13,350 --> 00:53:14,600
Horrific.
What kind was it?

1298
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,600
I don't know.
Dead stupid now.

1299
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:18,290
Just swamp.
Kill it.

1300
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:20,300
If you strongly you can't hang.
I couldn't,

1301
00:53:20,301 --> 00:53:22,080
I,
well I'm not going to go to bed with a

1302
00:53:22,850 --> 00:53:25,560
without their living with a bug
somewhere in house.

1303
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:28,410
Yeah.
There's a,

1304
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:31,200
there's a lot of weird shit and Doug's
area and die

1305
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:35,730
over a busy area.
He's just right next to Mexico.

1306
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:38,580
It's like knocking on Mexico's door.
You can run to Mexico.

1307
00:53:38,970 --> 00:53:42,420
Like literally trying to,
those spiders had papers,

1308
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:48,450
Bill.
Oh Bill.

1309
00:53:48,870 --> 00:53:52,500
Well just let the Mexicans then just
everybody relax.

1310
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:55,080
That's a terrifying when you'd leave his
area and they uh,

1311
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:57,610
you got to pull over and stop and they
ask you if you're a Mac,

1312
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,640
if you're an American citizen.
Yeah.

1313
00:53:59,641 --> 00:54:00,990
That's weird.
And then you go,

1314
00:54:00,991 --> 00:54:04,890
yeah,
I know a dude who has a ranch and it's

1315
00:54:04,891 --> 00:54:09,891
in south Texas and they find dead people
on the ranch sometimes where people

1316
00:54:10,051 --> 00:54:13,350
tried to cross paths,
they just die of dehydration.

1317
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:15,270
Yeah.
Out in the desert.

1318
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:17,390
Fuck,

1319
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:21,470
that's a hard way to go.
And then these ranchers just find them,

1320
00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:23,103
you know,

1321
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:26,010
scary shit and you don't know who did
it.

1322
00:54:26,011 --> 00:54:28,710
I mean the other thing is like if for
him and his,

1323
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,730
his place like,
uh,

1324
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:33,660
you don't know if this guy's going to be
a nice guy just trying to come over here

1325
00:54:33,661 --> 00:54:36,120
and get a job or if this guy's a drug
runner and a murderer,

1326
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:40,200
like you really don't know.
You just know there's a person in your

1327
00:54:40,201 --> 00:54:43,080
ranch that's not supposed to be there
and they might not even speak English

1328
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:43,973
and like,
Woo.

1329
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:47,160
Trying to think of something I would die
to get to.

1330
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:51,810
It seems to me to be here.
A lot of people get mad at me when I say

1331
00:54:51,811 --> 00:54:52,740
this,
but I'm gonna say it anyway.

1332
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:55,350
I think it's something that's going to
go away.

1333
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:57,420
The idea of countries and you can only
go one place,

1334
00:54:57,421 --> 00:54:59,040
like if you're born on this patch of
dirt,

1335
00:54:59,041 --> 00:55:00,360
you can only stay in this patch of dirt.

1336
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:04,170
It's an impediment to progress and it's
an impediment to quality.

1337
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:07,170
And I think that we've got,
there's gonna come a day where people

1338
00:55:07,171 --> 00:55:10,200
are just gonna be able to travel
anywhere they want and we're not going

1339
00:55:10,201 --> 00:55:13,470
to look at it like cities and we're not
going to look at it like in terms of

1340
00:55:13,471 --> 00:55:13,861
like,
you know,

1341
00:55:13,861 --> 00:55:16,710
you're lucky if you live in Boston,
you can move to Cleveland.

1342
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:18,540
If you live in Cleveland,
you can move to Miami,

1343
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:20,310
but you can move,
you can move wherever you want,

1344
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,590
but as soon as you have a country you
can't move.

1345
00:55:23,050 --> 00:55:24,900
You have to paper.
You got to get it approved.

1346
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:26,280
Well,
what kind of job do you have,

1347
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:27,001
Morgan?
Are you,

1348
00:55:27,001 --> 00:55:27,340
uh,
you,

1349
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:31,590
you have a specific skill that would
benefit America and extent of the rest

1350
00:55:31,591 --> 00:55:34,500
of our sloppy fucks and half of them
don't you jack.

1351
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:37,130
Shit,
are you better than the average person

1352
00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:39,780
washable that jam.
We only want to like quality people in.

1353
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:42,630
That's it.
I would never be able to prove myself in

1354
00:55:42,631 --> 00:55:46,290
that moment as being worthy of getting
into any country.

1355
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:49,530
They have a scale.
It's like exceptional skill,

1356
00:55:49,830 --> 00:55:53,010
person of exceptional skill.
It just seems,

1357
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:56,520
it seems fucked.
Like I dunno,

1358
00:55:57,470 --> 00:55:59,430
just,
it seems barbaric.

1359
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:02,620
Like it really does.
And I know people are Google man,

1360
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:05,270
just fucking go to understand American
sovereignty.

1361
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,490
It's very important that we keep the
rest of the world's fucked up.

1362
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:11,310
We've managed to figure out,
we got lucky,

1363
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,860
we got lucky and we got shit out on the
right patch of dirt.

1364
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:14,521
Yeah,
sure.

1365
00:56:14,521 --> 00:56:15,600
And we got,
uh,

1366
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:16,463
we have,
uh,

1367
00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:18,870
resources that a lot of other countries
don't have.

1368
00:56:18,871 --> 00:56:20,100
And I don't know.
I,

1369
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:20,880
I,
I try,

1370
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,160
I love to travel internationally.
I love,

1371
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:24,310
you know,

1372
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:26,680
putting myself in places that,
uh,

1373
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:28,030
are,
uh,

1374
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:29,120
you know,
the,

1375
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:33,190
that don't have what we have.
If that makes sense.

1376
00:56:33,191 --> 00:56:37,150
Like I am just for perspective.
I enjoy the present and enjoy making a

1377
00:56:37,151 --> 00:56:39,640
vacation.
Sort of a combination of a of,

1378
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:42,040
of pleasure and perspective,
uh,

1379
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:45,880
as much as I can.
And going places that you know,

1380
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:49,030
make you realize what you have at home.

1381
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,300
Do you think that it holds back both
sides?

1382
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:56,650
Do you think it holds back Mexico that
the United States is so difficult to get

1383
00:56:56,651 --> 00:57:00,580
into and then it's always like just a
spare of certain people trying to get

1384
00:57:00,581 --> 00:57:02,560
into Mexico,
trying to get an American can't.

1385
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:05,620
What I was going to get at is that I
think that it's kind of similar in some

1386
00:57:05,621 --> 00:57:09,730
way and I might be off what's similar in
some way to make drugs illegal

1387
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:11,860
[inaudible] that like you make drugs
illegal,

1388
00:57:11,861 --> 00:57:15,880
then you create this artificial there
this demand is increased demand and then

1389
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,400
it's outlawed.
So only people that are willing to break

1390
00:57:18,401 --> 00:57:21,310
the law sell it.
And so you that you had this criminal

1391
00:57:21,311 --> 00:57:23,970
criminal enterprise attached to
something that should be

1392
00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:26,570
perfectly legal.
I'm right coming.

1393
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,910
You're already breaking the law by,
by bike,

1394
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,200
by coming here.
Right.

1395
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:32,720
So are you a person is going to break
the law,

1396
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:34,400
right?
You're going to be a person who takes

1397
00:57:34,401 --> 00:57:35,091
that shot,
I think,

1398
00:57:35,091 --> 00:57:38,420
and also profit off of it by brand,
like one of those carriers,

1399
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:39,141
right?
Yeah.

1400
00:57:39,141 --> 00:57:41,870
I don't know.
I grew up in La and I think I had a,

1401
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:42,770
uh,
uh,

1402
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:45,380
I didn't realize that it was illegal,
you know,

1403
00:57:45,381 --> 00:57:47,270
as a kid,
you don't know laws or rules or

1404
00:57:47,271 --> 00:57:52,250
anything.
So I just assumed that Mexico and

1405
00:57:52,310 --> 00:57:53,660
California,
because I would,

1406
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:55,340
you know,
most almost the kids who went to school

1407
00:57:55,341 --> 00:57:57,530
with were Mexican.
Like I just assumed that it was like a

1408
00:57:57,531 --> 00:58:01,310
place where people live in both places
and you go back and forth a lot and you

1409
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:05,930
know,
the Mexican culture was so sort of the,

1410
00:58:05,931 --> 00:58:08,030
the whole,
my whole backdrop of my childhood was

1411
00:58:08,031 --> 00:58:08,810
painted with that.

1412
00:58:08,810 --> 00:58:11,060
So I just kind of assume that you went
where you wanted to.

1413
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:14,960
Yeah.
And like that La was mostly Mexican and

1414
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:16,970
that was fine.
Yeah.

1415
00:58:16,971 --> 00:58:17,960
It should be fine.
Right.

1416
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:20,360
And people will want to look at her,
come over here and take our jobs.

1417
00:58:20,361 --> 00:58:23,810
We're going to come over and Bruno
Erchonia working or is it all gonna even

1418
00:58:23,811 --> 00:58:25,820
out?
Like maybe it just evens out.

1419
00:58:26,690 --> 00:58:28,260
Isn't that possible?
Like,

1420
00:58:28,970 --> 00:58:29,960
yeah.
I also,

1421
00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:31,100
you know,
I mean it's,

1422
00:58:31,101 --> 00:58:34,100
it's beyond cliched to say,
but are they,

1423
00:58:34,101 --> 00:58:37,010
are people taking jobs that Americans
are dying to do now?

1424
00:58:38,030 --> 00:58:40,570
Yeah.
Well see,

1425
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,410
so if they come over here and they can
just come over here,

1426
00:58:42,411 --> 00:58:45,740
then you have to pay them the same rate.
It's like you have to pay them the same

1427
00:58:45,741 --> 00:58:46,810
rate that everybody gets paid.
Sure.

1428
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:48,320
There's wage limits

1429
00:58:49,310 --> 00:58:50,280
as a minimum wage.

1430
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:52,990
If you have them illegal,
you could pay them whenever the fuck you

1431
00:58:52,991 --> 00:58:54,430
want.
And they do.

1432
00:58:54,670 --> 00:58:57,100
That's like the big housekeeper dilemma.
How can that,

1433
00:58:57,110 --> 00:58:58,810
how the fuck fucker housekeepers asking
for a raise?

1434
00:58:59,230 --> 00:59:01,690
I don't ask her for a raise.
You can't say shit.

1435
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:03,550
Every time the word housekeeper comes
out of my mouth,

1436
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:04,360
I like,
uh,

1437
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:05,950
I get a little,
I get a little red,

1438
00:59:06,010 --> 00:59:08,020
little embarrassed because I have a
housekeeper now.

1439
00:59:08,021 --> 00:59:08,890
I never had,
you know,

1440
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:09,820
I mean,
I just feel bad.

1441
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,380
It doesn't make me feel bad.
I,

1442
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:16,120
I absolutely,
I couldn't love her more and she's very

1443
00:59:16,121 --> 00:59:20,590
much become kind of a,
a pseudo mother figure of mine in La.

1444
00:59:20,591 --> 00:59:21,800
I don't have family here really.

1445
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:25,340
And,
but I also feel like that makes me sound

1446
00:59:25,341 --> 00:59:29,840
like a pretentious white person who's
taking care of a person of color.

1447
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:31,430
It like,
it really,

1448
00:59:31,431 --> 00:59:32,510
uh,
it really,

1449
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,990
it's not comp,
it's not comfortable subject for me to

1450
00:59:35,991 --> 00:59:39,320
talk about.
And yet I couldn't be more like

1451
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:43,040
earnestly grateful and thankful and,
uh,

1452
00:59:43,070 --> 00:59:45,290
I couldn't adore her more and,
and really,

1453
00:59:45,291 --> 00:59:50,291
she helps me function in life and yet
the varies the subject is,

1454
00:59:51,741 --> 00:59:52,140
you know,
I mean,

1455
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:54,590
I didn't grow up with that kind of
stuff,

1456
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:55,424
so it's,

1457
00:59:56,490 --> 00:59:57,830
it's embarrassing.
Well,

1458
00:59:57,890 --> 01:00:00,020
as long as you pair well and you're
nicer,

1459
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:01,760
it's just a job,
you know,

1460
01:00:01,761 --> 01:00:04,520
as long as she enjoys doing the job and
she gets paid well,

1461
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:06,740
it's just a job.
There's nothing wrong with being a

1462
01:00:06,741 --> 01:00:07,940
garbage man.
Yeah.

1463
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:09,170
Something wrong with any job.

1464
01:00:09,370 --> 01:00:10,031
Yeah.
I mean,

1465
01:00:10,031 --> 01:00:10,391
I,
you know,

1466
01:00:10,391 --> 01:00:13,540
she's known me through apartments and,
you know,

1467
01:00:13,541 --> 01:00:14,100
so it's,
it's,

1468
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:15,640
it's,
it's interesting when someone just a

1469
01:00:15,641 --> 01:00:17,930
part of your life and,
um,

1470
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:22,480
and seems to care about you more than
you even think they should,

1471
01:00:22,481 --> 01:00:23,650
if that makes,
like she,

1472
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:24,820
well,
you're her boss.

1473
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:29,940
I'm her boss,
but she's the only person in my home.

1474
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:31,880
And you know,
I,

1475
01:00:31,910 --> 01:00:36,400
I trust her,
but she also seems to care about me in

1476
01:00:36,401 --> 01:00:38,110
this way.
She wants me to have a kid.

1477
01:00:38,111 --> 01:00:38,944
Like,
she's like,

1478
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:40,630
it's all these things that you're,
you know,

1479
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:42,290
I don't really talk to my mom's like,
I have this,

1480
01:00:42,291 --> 01:00:44,980
this housekeeper who was like,
you should have a baby and then I'll

1481
01:00:44,981 --> 01:00:46,690
take care of it.
She has like a plan for my whole life.

1482
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:47,950
Well,
I don't do it yet.

1483
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:50,050
And tour,
it sounds like you've got some sort of a

1484
01:00:50,051 --> 01:00:52,240
partner,
a life partner.

1485
01:00:52,241 --> 01:00:55,780
I didn't have a life partner.
Shivaas Teresa life partner.

1486
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:57,451
I Dunno.
It's,

1487
01:00:57,451 --> 01:00:58,270
it's,
uh,

1488
01:00:58,270 --> 01:01:02,290
it's always a touchy subject because
there's historically been people that

1489
01:01:02,291 --> 01:01:06,610
have come from other places and they've
immigrated into places and then,

1490
01:01:06,611 --> 01:01:08,050
you know,
they create neighborhoods.

1491
01:01:08,051 --> 01:01:10,180
And they,
there are certain class of people

1492
01:01:10,181 --> 01:01:15,181
initially and then they move through
society and I mean my people have

1493
01:01:15,281 --> 01:01:18,460
experienced at the Italians,
like when my grandfather came over here,

1494
01:01:18,610 --> 01:01:23,560
there was all these like negative
stereotypes for Italians and there's all

1495
01:01:23,561 --> 01:01:26,980
these slurs like these to call them my
Guinea wop and all these different,

1496
01:01:27,390 --> 01:01:29,970
they were like hurtful.
Like today if you call someone a Guinea

1497
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:32,620
knowing like I would say I'm a Guinea,
like nobody gives a shit.

1498
01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:34,630
Call Sebastian again.
He'd be like,

1499
01:01:34,631 --> 01:01:36,820
Yep,
like it doesn't bother anybody.

1500
01:01:36,850 --> 01:01:38,380
You know?
It's like it became,

1501
01:01:38,770 --> 01:01:41,500
they became a class of people that
normalized.

1502
01:01:41,530 --> 01:01:43,630
They just,
they fit if they fit in with like

1503
01:01:43,631 --> 01:01:46,810
regular white people,
like Italians were not considered white

1504
01:01:46,811 --> 01:01:49,060
people the same way.
A lot of people from the Middle East

1505
01:01:49,061 --> 01:01:52,570
that have like the same skin tone are
consider white people by some people

1506
01:01:52,571 --> 01:01:53,590
today,
you know?

1507
01:01:53,591 --> 01:01:54,910
But if they,
if there was more,

1508
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:59,940
if it became just say normal part like
Irish people [inaudible] Irishman,

1509
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:01,590
glamorous woman.
Yeah.

1510
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:05,290
I enter swimming.
If they could become white people.

1511
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:09,130
If they just figured out a way to get
white to get wider,

1512
01:02:09,730 --> 01:02:13,600
we should just just gotta be away.
Just keeping doors moving to Oregon.

1513
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:17,920
Have to wilder evolve the lack of Sun.
They will evolve into being white

1514
01:02:17,921 --> 01:02:20,220
people.
Yeah,

1515
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:22,260
I dunno.
I just think you know,

1516
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:26,220
anytime you restrict things that should
be normal,

1517
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:30,090
like moving to a better spot so you
can't move to a better spot.

1518
01:02:30,110 --> 01:02:31,120
Like,
oh I can't,

1519
01:02:31,490 --> 01:02:33,330
I can't,
what if I buy a house in that spot?

1520
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:34,430
Nope.
Can't move to that.

1521
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:35,321
Well,
I mean it's,

1522
01:02:35,321 --> 01:02:37,450
it's sort of arbitrary and like how do
you,

1523
01:02:37,990 --> 01:02:40,990
there's some,
I'm very fascinated by like migration in

1524
01:02:40,991 --> 01:02:44,530
general of like towns.
Where are you're encouraged to stay?

1525
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:46,180
Like that is always very interesting to
me.

1526
01:02:46,181 --> 01:02:47,500
Like you don't leave,
don't leave,

1527
01:02:47,501 --> 01:02:48,221
don't leave,
don't leave.

1528
01:02:48,221 --> 01:02:50,890
Like what if you were told you can't
stay,

1529
01:02:51,430 --> 01:02:53,800
you have to leave and you have to go
populate this other area.

1530
01:02:53,801 --> 01:02:54,820
Like what's the different,
you know,

1531
01:02:54,821 --> 01:02:56,080
it just,
we're,

1532
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:58,240
we're choosing where people

1533
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:02,210
can live and we don't know what would be
the best place for them.

1534
01:03:02,211 --> 01:03:04,760
We don't know if the best place for them
is right next door to you,

1535
01:03:04,761 --> 01:03:06,800
even if you don't want it.
I was watching a guy,

1536
01:03:06,970 --> 01:03:08,370
Ooh,
on TV.

1537
01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:13,390
They were doing this interview with him.
He was a coffee farmer in Hawaii and

1538
01:03:13,910 --> 01:03:17,060
the,
he started out as a 15 year old in

1539
01:03:17,061 --> 01:03:19,880
America.
So He's been in America from the time he

1540
01:03:19,881 --> 01:03:22,700
was 15 he was in his forties now he has
a family.

1541
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:25,580
He's been in America for us more than I
think.

1542
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:29,120
I think they were saying like 30 years.
Okay,

1543
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:33,140
so this guy,
why family worked his way up from being

1544
01:03:33,141 --> 01:03:38,090
a worker at this coffee farm to owning
the fucking coffee farm?

1545
01:03:39,850 --> 01:03:41,960
I think he owned it sounds better if I
say,

1546
01:03:41,961 --> 01:03:43,100
you know,
one day my manager,

1547
01:03:43,101 --> 01:03:44,300
he was at,
he had a big job.

1548
01:03:44,330 --> 01:03:47,090
He's a big man at the coffee farm and
they're kicking him out.

1549
01:03:47,091 --> 01:03:49,840
They're moving them to Mexico,
their export Jesus,

1550
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,990
and he just got some stay some,
you know,

1551
01:03:52,991 --> 01:03:57,470
or where they allowed him to stay there
a couple more months to appeal his case.

1552
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:00,620
But if I love Jesus Christ,
the guy did it.

1553
01:04:00,910 --> 01:04:02,660
He came,
he came over here,

1554
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:07,720
he was 15 he's a part of America now.
He's 30 something years old or 40 years

1555
01:04:08,151 --> 01:04:09,230
old,
whatever the fuck he is.

1556
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:09,950
He could have already

1557
01:04:09,950 --> 01:04:11,870
serve time for,
for murder.

1558
01:04:12,430 --> 01:04:14,770
Like he could have done a full sentence
already.

1559
01:04:14,810 --> 01:04:16,160
His time positively.

1560
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:19,180
He's actually doing well.
He's doing what you want is being a

1561
01:04:19,181 --> 01:04:21,790
productive member of society is
employing other people.

1562
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:24,460
He's making coffee,
which I'm not going to fucking grow

1563
01:04:24,461 --> 01:04:26,290
coffee.
I need someone to grow that God damn

1564
01:04:26,291 --> 01:04:28,600
coffee.
That guy's doing a great job.

1565
01:04:28,810 --> 01:04:30,430
That's a fucking American.
It is.

1566
01:04:30,431 --> 01:04:32,290
Make a move.
It's crazy.

1567
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:34,450
It's like make you move to where you,
you moved around a lot.

1568
01:04:34,451 --> 01:04:38,380
Where the fuck were you and your 15 I
was a in Connecticut.

1569
01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:39,880
Yeah.
You're in Connecticut and I'm in

1570
01:04:39,881 --> 01:04:41,110
Massachusetts.
We have to move.

1571
01:04:41,170 --> 01:04:45,850
Imagine thugs come knocking on our door
with combat boots on holding guns and

1572
01:04:45,851 --> 01:04:46,990
say,
listen Morgan,

1573
01:04:47,110 --> 01:04:49,600
you got to move.
You can't stay in California anymore.

1574
01:04:49,601 --> 01:04:51,700
It's too many people in California.
You've got to go back,

1575
01:04:51,970 --> 01:04:53,080
back to the east coast.

1576
01:04:53,660 --> 01:04:55,340
Insane.
So same thing that they're doing it.

1577
01:04:55,810 --> 01:04:56,501
It's insane.
It's,

1578
01:04:56,501 --> 01:04:56,961
it's,
it's,

1579
01:04:56,961 --> 01:04:57,890
I don't,
I mean,

1580
01:04:58,460 --> 01:04:59,181
I dunno,
I don't,

1581
01:04:59,181 --> 01:05:01,490
I don't get it,
but I went on where you were when we did

1582
01:05:01,491 --> 01:05:01,761
the,
uh,

1583
01:05:01,761 --> 01:05:03,890
the end of the world podcast.
You guys did that one.

1584
01:05:03,891 --> 01:05:06,590
I remember it coming out at the end.
Hammered,

1585
01:05:06,591 --> 01:05:07,580
hammered,
hammered.

1586
01:05:07,581 --> 01:05:10,520
As I say,
hammered since I had been hammered since

1587
01:05:10,521 --> 01:05:14,030
Florida results came in and everything
was already done.

1588
01:05:14,390 --> 01:05:16,790
And I show up and it's a,
you know,

1589
01:05:16,791 --> 01:05:18,610
a row on stage

1590
01:05:19,150 --> 01:05:22,750
and I get there and I have no,
I have only feelings.

1591
01:05:22,751 --> 01:05:24,910
I have no,
nothing in my brain is working to

1592
01:05:24,911 --> 01:05:27,340
connect pieces are really be,
you know,

1593
01:05:27,370 --> 01:05:31,780
remotely sort of eloquent.
I just came out and I was like,

1594
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:36,370
eyes is bad for people and everyone's
going to be racist that we,

1595
01:05:36,430 --> 01:05:38,320
you know,
people should be able to do what they

1596
01:05:38,321 --> 01:05:40,540
want.
Like I just had a charity on and started

1597
01:05:40,541 --> 01:05:42,010
making out.
Did we?

1598
01:05:42,590 --> 01:05:44,160
You don't remember that I didn't make
out.

1599
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:45,153
No,
just kidding.

1600
01:05:46,930 --> 01:05:48,190
Front of anybody,
but,

1601
01:05:48,191 --> 01:05:50,530
but uh,
but burb just hammered me.

1602
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:52,600
I mean,
he came back with with,

1603
01:05:52,630 --> 01:05:54,700
you know,
basically I felt there was like a lot of

1604
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:57,460
energy that I came in with the worst
thing that's ever happened.

1605
01:05:57,461 --> 01:06:00,190
Just happened.
That was my energy and I felt like there

1606
01:06:00,191 --> 01:06:02,950
was a lot of,
you know,

1607
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:04,920
don't know,
you know,

1608
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:07,810
it might not be that bad energy that
night,

1609
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:10,460
but hey,
this is what's really going on.

1610
01:06:10,670 --> 01:06:13,490
First of all,
you got a bunch of comics in front of an

1611
01:06:13,491 --> 01:06:14,180
audience,
right?

1612
01:06:14,180 --> 01:06:15,920
That's the number one thing that's
happening.

1613
01:06:16,130 --> 01:06:20,690
This fucking election is to us,
to me and Bert and anybody else who's

1614
01:06:20,691 --> 01:06:22,700
there,
it's like this is an opportunity to talk

1615
01:06:22,701 --> 01:06:23,540
shit.
Okay.

1616
01:06:23,541 --> 01:06:25,070
And the fact that there's an election
when I'm like,

1617
01:06:25,071 --> 01:06:26,780
we're,
we'll deal with the consequences of

1618
01:06:26,781 --> 01:06:29,690
Donald Trump being president later,
but right now we're here to make people

1619
01:06:29,691 --> 01:06:34,691
laugh and have fun and burn is on fire.
It was on fire.

1620
01:06:35,140 --> 01:06:36,020
He,
he was a,

1621
01:06:36,021 --> 01:06:39,070
he shines and those things like no one.
Yeah,

1622
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:42,820
he was just like one after the other
smashing it.

1623
01:06:42,950 --> 01:06:46,670
There's a video online you can get on
youtube that's like the best of Bill

1624
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:48,140
Burr at the end of the world podcast.
Yeah,

1625
01:06:48,260 --> 01:06:50,300
he's just slaying.
It was,

1626
01:06:50,301 --> 01:06:53,480
and I came in like,
and I like threw a cup of gasoline on

1627
01:06:53,481 --> 01:06:54,770
the fire with my opinions.

1628
01:06:54,770 --> 01:06:55,980
I was like,
yeah,

1629
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:58,820
but it's not really in a pan.
I mean it's like you have to understand

1630
01:06:58,821 --> 01:07:02,630
from the perspective of a Zine,
not saying you have to understand,

1631
01:07:02,631 --> 01:07:03,800
but the people listening,
right?

1632
01:07:03,810 --> 01:07:06,740
Like when would do something like that.
There's a bunch of comics and there's an

1633
01:07:06,741 --> 01:07:10,280
audience like we're not,
we're not always going to deal with

1634
01:07:10,281 --> 01:07:11,940
what's going on.
We're not going to be somber.

1635
01:07:11,941 --> 01:07:13,970
Surely be considering the fact that,
okay,

1636
01:07:13,971 --> 01:07:15,470
well now we don't have a president
anymore.

1637
01:07:15,620 --> 01:07:20,000
We've just elected a buffoon to the
biggest popularity contest in the world

1638
01:07:20,001 --> 01:07:22,910
is what we did.
It's a popular person one now and now

1639
01:07:22,911 --> 01:07:26,480
we're fucked and he's an egomaniac and
now he's in charge of the nukes.

1640
01:07:26,510 --> 01:07:28,210
Congratulate Hell you could fire the FBI
guy.

1641
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:30,740
Look at that.
You just let a reality star just start

1642
01:07:30,741 --> 01:07:33,440
firing the people that you need for
critical intelligence,

1643
01:07:33,441 --> 01:07:36,400
people that have been involved,
the intelligence industry and the

1644
01:07:36,410 --> 01:07:39,860
intelligence community for decade after
decade after decade,

1645
01:07:40,010 --> 01:07:42,380
you let this reality star just start
firing people.

1646
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:44,730
It's nuts,
but it was also the best place I could

1647
01:07:44,731 --> 01:07:48,050
have ended up that night.
Like I can't imagine having spent a,

1648
01:07:48,290 --> 01:07:51,530
I mean I,
I I think I went to bed at like she got

1649
01:07:51,531 --> 01:07:54,830
together with Jen Kirkman 7:00 AM your
time.

1650
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:58,130
I looked at her twitter and I was like,
I just got to stay away.

1651
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:02,720
You guys are freaking me the fuck out.
Like Jesus,

1652
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:04,340
he,
this is a bad system.

1653
01:08:04,370 --> 01:08:07,970
It's been a bad system since people
figured out how to make phone calls.

1654
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:09,890
You know,
as soon as people figured out how to

1655
01:08:09,891 --> 01:08:11,960
make phone calls,
you didn't have to get a guy on a

1656
01:08:11,961 --> 01:08:16,961
fucking horse that carries your vote and
your request for sovereignty and your

1657
01:08:17,481 --> 01:08:22,040
personal state by a messenger that us to
take it to some fucking representative

1658
01:08:22,041 --> 01:08:24,590
as take it to Congress on this fucking
boat.

1659
01:08:25,190 --> 01:08:26,720
Like you don't have to do that anymore.

1660
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:28,490
So since we don't have to do this
anymore,

1661
01:08:28,491 --> 01:08:33,110
this idea of one person running the
whole Shebang through a representative

1662
01:08:33,111 --> 01:08:35,120
of each individual state,
it's archaic.

1663
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:39,440
It's communication is too good.
Now the bottleneck is the system.

1664
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:42,140
The system needs to be redesigned.
It needs to be redesigned.

1665
01:08:42,141 --> 01:08:44,180
It's not impossible.
No one's saying we shouldn't have

1666
01:08:44,181 --> 01:08:46,070
government.
I'm not an antigovernment purple,

1667
01:08:46,190 --> 01:08:49,250
purple,
purple person looks like I'm not an anti

1668
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:51,470
military person or an anti police
person.

1669
01:08:51,471 --> 01:08:54,650
I just think it all has to be managed
and engineered the right way.

1670
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:59,330
Like you can't have just complete
anarchy in this country,

1671
01:08:59,331 --> 01:09:01,340
but we have to have the will of the
people.

1672
01:09:01,341 --> 01:09:03,440
And right now it's definitely not the
will of the people.

1673
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:07,160
This is just some weird system that
someone's figured out a way to win.

1674
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:10,010
And then once they're in the system,
we're realizing all the flaws of the

1675
01:09:10,011 --> 01:09:10,370
system.

1676
01:09:10,370 --> 01:09:11,930
People are quitting and getting fine.
You're like,

1677
01:09:12,110 --> 01:09:13,820
well,
this is not the most efficient way to

1678
01:09:13,821 --> 01:09:14,820
run this thing.
Right?

1679
01:09:14,930 --> 01:09:15,800
But there's no,
uh,

1680
01:09:15,801 --> 01:09:16,850
there's no,
uh,

1681
01:09:16,851 --> 01:09:19,220
it within the system.
There is no,

1682
01:09:19,221 --> 01:09:21,630
here's how you change the system like
that has been established.

1683
01:09:21,631 --> 01:09:23,930
And then you have to do that in a way
that doesn't,

1684
01:09:23,931 --> 01:09:25,040
uh,
you know,

1685
01:09:25,070 --> 01:09:27,170
make everybody implode.
So the system,

1686
01:09:27,171 --> 01:09:29,720
the design of the system,
and this is a more than I've,

1687
01:09:29,930 --> 01:09:33,740
I've paid attention more to the
political system in the last two years

1688
01:09:33,741 --> 01:09:36,800
and I think I have in my entire life.
But there's all these checks and

1689
01:09:36,801 --> 01:09:41,801
balances that are in place to sort of
prevent someone who's an irreputable

1690
01:09:43,730 --> 01:09:46,850
person getting into a position of power
and then changing everything.

1691
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:49,400
There's enough checks and balances to
keep that in place.

1692
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:52,550
And that I think that's important.
And that's a beautiful thing.

1693
01:09:52,580 --> 01:09:57,200
And having all these representatives
that represent both conservative and

1694
01:09:57,201 --> 01:10:00,470
liberal attitudes kind of keep things in
balance to a certain extent,

1695
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:03,220
but it's not the best way to do it.
No,

1696
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:07,250
the best way to do it would be to get a
guy like Elon musk and say,

1697
01:10:07,251 --> 01:10:08,400
hey man,
the way you,

1698
01:10:08,401 --> 01:10:11,330
uh,
figured out how to put fucking tunnels

1699
01:10:11,331 --> 01:10:15,230
under the earth where the cars go on
sleds and that eliminates all the

1700
01:10:15,231 --> 01:10:18,410
traffic in La.
And the way they figured out how to make

1701
01:10:18,411 --> 01:10:22,850
like a solar box that sits in a garage
on the wall and it powers your whole

1702
01:10:22,851 --> 01:10:26,720
house from the roof and the way they
figured out how to make roof shingles

1703
01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:29,120
that are actually solar patent,
the rate of the figured out how to make

1704
01:10:29,121 --> 01:10:33,110
an electric car then go 350 miles.
How about tell us how to fund this

1705
01:10:33,111 --> 01:10:33,740
thing,
right?

1706
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:36,140
Like you're definitely smarter than me.
Yeah,

1707
01:10:36,141 --> 01:10:39,070
I mean most people does he make the
decisions?

1708
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:40,850
Is it like,
cause I just think about like when they

1709
01:10:40,851 --> 01:10:43,610
change rules and major league it,
I always find it like interesting like

1710
01:10:43,611 --> 01:10:45,830
that a group of people got together and
like now what is it?

1711
01:10:45,831 --> 01:10:48,830
Overtime football over time says shorten
now and they like,

1712
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:50,600
like I,
oh now it's a timid as now it's five

1713
01:10:50,601 --> 01:10:52,310
minutes and we all just go,
okay,

1714
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:56,630
like who's who's the board?
Who's the person who gets to say,

1715
01:10:56,631 --> 01:10:58,640
okay,
now this is the way that the government

1716
01:10:58,641 --> 01:11:00,800
works.
I mean that's it's ellen process.

1717
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:02,420
Well,
football is very different obviously

1718
01:11:02,421 --> 01:11:05,630
because it's a game and you're trying to
make the game better and more exciting.

1719
01:11:05,930 --> 01:11:08,690
If they were just trying to fuck with
people and make politics more exciting,

1720
01:11:08,990 --> 01:11:12,020
maybe that would be more of that.
Maybe that would work.

1721
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:14,040
I just make it,
how do make this better?

1722
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:16,530
How do we make this better?
How do we make people like this more?

1723
01:11:16,531 --> 01:11:18,210
How do we make people feel like they're
involved?

1724
01:11:18,211 --> 01:11:20,040
How do we do this?
But again,

1725
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:24,480
I usually like changing the rules.
It seems like the,

1726
01:11:24,481 --> 01:11:26,970
I just don't eat,
I don't know how long.

1727
01:11:26,971 --> 01:11:28,470
Something like that takes.
Is it,

1728
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:31,410
is it over generations?
Is it tomorrow?

1729
01:11:31,411 --> 01:11:34,230
The rules are this.
I mean how do you do that?

1730
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:39,540
I think you make people park at the
bottom of a hill and you put the voting

1731
01:11:41,111 --> 01:11:46,111
booth at the very top of the hill and
only the people that can actually like,

1732
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:50,710
unless you're physically handicap,
then you get a pass.

1733
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:52,480
Then we'll figure out another task for
you,

1734
01:11:52,660 --> 01:11:56,320
but only the people that figure out to
get their fucking lazy ass to the top of

1735
01:11:56,321 --> 01:11:58,240
that hill.
Those are the only ones who get to vote.

1736
01:11:59,530 --> 01:12:02,490
Hi,
fine by me.

1737
01:12:02,910 --> 01:12:04,800
But that's a big thing.
You're going to have to tell somebody

1738
01:12:04,801 --> 01:12:06,960
whether it was I hope and say,
all right,

1739
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:08,000
I'll probably say,
all right,

1740
01:12:08,070 --> 01:12:09,830
mountain hikers are just going to run
the world.

1741
01:12:10,770 --> 01:12:12,570
Alex honnold is going to be our
president,

1742
01:12:12,571 --> 01:12:14,730
that rock climber dude,
he's going to be number one.

1743
01:12:15,190 --> 01:12:17,400
No,
I just think that if we just come up

1744
01:12:17,401 --> 01:12:21,660
with an alternative system that somebody
designs and we slowly implement it like

1745
01:12:21,661 --> 01:12:23,580
in stages,
you know,

1746
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,740
but every time someone doesn't like
something,

1747
01:12:26,850 --> 01:12:31,350
everyone is so aggressively angry now
and everyone is kind of a,

1748
01:12:31,410 --> 01:12:32,670
you know,
on the,

1749
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:34,770
on the,
on the precipice of snapping.

1750
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:40,140
And I feel like any kind of suggested
change to a lot of people is,

1751
01:12:40,170 --> 01:12:41,003
is terrifying.

1752
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,020
It is terrifying.
And it should be because if somebody

1753
01:12:43,021 --> 01:12:44,880
fucks it up and Putin's this whole
thing,

1754
01:12:45,310 --> 01:12:47,130
you know,
that could be a big goddamn disaster

1755
01:12:47,131 --> 01:12:48,390
too.
That's always possible.

1756
01:12:48,391 --> 01:12:50,660
Like this is his closest that's come.
I'm like,

1757
01:12:50,670 --> 01:12:54,390
this is as close as it's coming to
something where he's kind of 33%

1758
01:12:54,391 --> 01:12:57,690
approval rate or something like that
except the pole that he found.

1759
01:12:57,700 --> 01:13:00,690
So it's 50% yeah.
What does that hilarious that you can

1760
01:13:00,691 --> 01:13:04,860
put up a picture.
It says 50% of the people like me and

1761
01:13:04,861 --> 01:13:05,311
the,
you'd be like,

1762
01:13:05,311 --> 01:13:07,380
wow,
he's really doing a great job.

1763
01:13:08,370 --> 01:13:11,430
Like you're never going to see a
president with a hundred percent

1764
01:13:11,431 --> 01:13:12,540
approval rate.
It does not.

1765
01:13:12,541 --> 01:13:12,690
Okay.

1766
01:13:12,690 --> 01:13:14,720
It's so tragic that mean he is,
he is.

1767
01:13:14,721 --> 01:13:17,960
I can't think of a time my brain has
been this consumed by,

1768
01:13:18,050 --> 01:13:19,340
uh,
by a president.

1769
01:13:19,670 --> 01:13:20,290
Right?
Like,

1770
01:13:20,290 --> 01:13:21,530
you know,
positive or negative.

1771
01:13:21,531 --> 01:13:22,030
I mean,
I,

1772
01:13:22,030 --> 01:13:22,581
you know,
I,

1773
01:13:22,581 --> 01:13:25,370
I liked Obama,
but I never thought about him as much as

1774
01:13:25,371 --> 01:13:26,270
I think about trump.

1775
01:13:26,690 --> 01:13:30,140
Even if you have like things like
vitamins,

1776
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:32,690
vitamins would not have a 100% approval
rate.

1777
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:34,940
Right.
There's people that will like flip

1778
01:13:34,941 --> 01:13:36,770
vitamins.
I don't even need them.

1779
01:13:36,771 --> 01:13:39,310
They saw and they would give it a,

1780
01:13:39,390 --> 01:13:41,970
well,
like actual western medicine doesn't

1781
01:13:41,971 --> 01:13:44,190
have a hundred percent approve of.
There are people who go like,

1782
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:45,870
no,
I don't want any treatment for my

1783
01:13:45,871 --> 01:13:46,704
cancer.
I'm going to,

1784
01:13:47,250 --> 01:13:47,840
well that's because

1785
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:52,040
there alternatives and there are there
is there some people that believe that

1786
01:13:52,041 --> 01:13:57,041
you can do more work like to cure or to
a halt cancer in its tracks by altering

1787
01:13:59,061 --> 01:14:00,500
your diet and proving your immune
system?

1788
01:14:00,710 --> 01:14:03,830
I believe that more than like a,
uh,

1789
01:14:03,890 --> 01:14:04,581
you know,
no,

1790
01:14:04,581 --> 01:14:09,581
the Lord will provide my medicine,
but I think more and more doctors are

1791
01:14:09,681 --> 01:14:12,070
acutely aware of the factor that
nutrition

1792
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:13,450
plays down.
I think they changed,

1793
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:17,710
they make changes to people not just
like give them drugs and give them,

1794
01:14:17,770 --> 01:14:20,200
you know,
anti cancer medication.

1795
01:14:20,201 --> 01:14:23,770
But there's doctors now more
increasingly more and more that want you

1796
01:14:23,771 --> 01:14:24,910
to hate.
You drink too much,

1797
01:14:24,911 --> 01:14:26,830
stopped drinking.
Are you smoking cigarettes?

1798
01:14:26,831 --> 01:14:28,690
We definitely got to get you to stop
smoking cigarettes.

1799
01:14:28,691 --> 01:14:29,880
We got to get you to eat healthy.
Like,

1800
01:14:29,890 --> 01:14:32,030
or here's what's important.
I feel like you're directly talking.

1801
01:14:32,031 --> 01:14:32,864
No right now.
Right.

1802
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:34,900
Uh Huh.

1803
01:14:36,670 --> 01:14:39,490
I just think that uh,
you have to pay attention at doctors

1804
01:14:39,491 --> 01:14:41,410
too.
Like these motherfuckers might have

1805
01:14:41,411 --> 01:14:43,570
figured out a way to cure your cancer,
but you've got to listen.

1806
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:47,050
You can't listen to the holistic healer
lady that has incense burning in her

1807
01:14:47,051 --> 01:14:49,360
fucking house.
She smells a bit Julie.

1808
01:14:49,660 --> 01:14:52,430
Maybe a little from column a.
You gotta be careful though.

1809
01:14:52,630 --> 01:14:54,370
Truly smell and motherfuckers,

1810
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:55,970
I just did some weird,
uh,

1811
01:14:56,030 --> 01:14:56,960
I did,
uh,

1812
01:14:57,020 --> 01:14:58,550
Kalanick at some,
you know,

1813
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,160
hippie ranch type place.
Dude,

1814
01:15:01,161 --> 01:15:03,170
you gotta pipe up your ass.
Had a pipe up my ass.

1815
01:15:03,230 --> 01:15:04,550
What was that like?
Uh,

1816
01:15:04,551 --> 01:15:09,551
it was uh,
it was oddly a oddly positive experience

1817
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:15,700
and I didn't think it would be,
I know it was a guy I was in Bisbee,

1818
01:15:16,101 --> 01:15:17,120
uh,
around,

1819
01:15:17,121 --> 01:15:18,290
uh,
Doug's place and I,

1820
01:15:18,350 --> 01:15:20,050
you know,
took off for the day and got to

1821
01:15:20,270 --> 01:15:21,480
Kalanick.
Wow.

1822
01:15:21,510 --> 01:15:23,040
Have you done that before or was it on a
whim?

1823
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:27,200
A semi on a witness?
It was like,

1824
01:15:27,201 --> 01:15:27,561
yeah.
Yeah.

1825
01:15:27,561 --> 01:15:30,560
I called the play loud,
was looking for healthy things to do in

1826
01:15:30,561 --> 01:15:31,130
the desert

1827
01:15:31,130 --> 01:15:34,310
and that was one of them.
What percentage of people take colonics

1828
01:15:34,311 --> 01:15:35,720
on a whim?
Like,

1829
01:15:35,750 --> 01:15:38,510
what percentage does it even 10 where
people would just walk down the street.

1830
01:15:38,511 --> 01:15:39,231
Look,
you know,

1831
01:15:39,231 --> 01:15:40,064
it'd be fun.

1832
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:41,440
We should really,
yeah,

1833
01:15:41,441 --> 01:15:43,780
I don't think there's a lot of colonics
ways where like advertise for foot

1834
01:15:43,781 --> 01:15:45,790
traffic.
So,

1835
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:47,050
uh,
yeah,

1836
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:49,330
come on in and we'll stick a pipe up
your ass.

1837
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:50,710
But I try,
you know,

1838
01:15:50,740 --> 01:15:53,320
it's that thing where I'm not like you,
I don't have a,

1839
01:15:53,321 --> 01:15:55,840
a,
I don't have a healthy lifestyle.

1840
01:15:55,870 --> 01:15:58,360
So I find myself hitting walls and then
reaching,

1841
01:15:58,361 --> 01:16:00,680
kind of grasping for,
um,

1842
01:16:00,730 --> 01:16:03,880
activities that seem healthy and
enjoyable,

1843
01:16:03,881 --> 01:16:05,770
which is why I've like,
you know,

1844
01:16:05,930 --> 01:16:06,370
like,
oh,

1845
01:16:06,370 --> 01:16:08,260
I'll go,
there's a boxing surfing,

1846
01:16:08,261 --> 01:16:09,780
I'll go play basketball,
you know,

1847
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:12,880
but I don't do it as consistently as I
ought to.

1848
01:16:13,210 --> 01:16:15,610
That's why it's always impressive to see
you,

1849
01:16:16,150 --> 01:16:18,100
you know,
peak form,

1850
01:16:18,101 --> 01:16:18,940
constantly

1851
01:16:21,170 --> 01:16:22,520
do things.
You like doing it.

1852
01:16:22,521 --> 01:16:23,200
So I did.
That's how,

1853
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:23,721
you know,
I like it.

1854
01:16:23,721 --> 01:16:24,980
I like sport.
I love sports.

1855
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:28,040
That's a great way to stay healthy for
me.

1856
01:16:28,041 --> 01:16:31,790
I found out somewhere along the line
note fit for me to be better at certain

1857
01:16:31,791 --> 01:16:33,380
sports.
I have to do shit.

1858
01:16:33,381 --> 01:16:36,710
I don't want it to like lift weights,
run hills,

1859
01:16:36,770 --> 01:16:39,080
like stuff like that.
Like if you don't do those things you

1860
01:16:39,081 --> 01:16:41,050
don't have,
like if you want it,

1861
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:46,040
you want to make an analogy to machines
like you ever weird opportunity with

1862
01:16:46,041 --> 01:16:51,041
your body where say if you're in a race,
you can turn your body into a sports

1863
01:16:51,411 --> 01:16:52,244
car.

1864
01:16:52,790 --> 01:16:53,370
Okay?

1865
01:16:53,370 --> 01:16:56,860
Like you can literally turn your body
into something that does something a

1866
01:16:56,861 --> 01:16:59,040
regular car can't do.
It can move faster,

1867
01:16:59,041 --> 01:17:00,990
could pick up more.
It can explode.

1868
01:17:00,991 --> 01:17:04,230
It can make corners better.
Like you can do that to your body.

1869
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:08,160
You can give your body balance.
Like you take a yoga class two days a

1870
01:17:08,161 --> 01:17:11,840
week for four months.
Don't tell me your body is not better.

1871
01:17:11,930 --> 01:17:14,420
It's going to move better.
That's going to be more balanced.

1872
01:17:14,421 --> 01:17:15,740
You're going to,
you get to be able to change the

1873
01:17:15,741 --> 01:17:19,130
suspension on your car literally by
putting in the work.

1874
01:17:19,131 --> 01:17:19,430
But the [inaudible]

1875
01:17:19,430 --> 01:17:22,940
work and suck a fat one.
Sorry Dude.

1876
01:17:22,941 --> 01:17:27,941
I know it's so hard at anything,
but you got to get excited about doing

1877
01:17:28,401 --> 01:17:30,880
hard shit icon.
I get excited about,

1878
01:17:30,881 --> 01:17:33,440
uh,
I get excited about the prospect of

1879
01:17:33,441 --> 01:17:37,520
getting in better shape after the age I
am now than I was before.

1880
01:17:37,521 --> 01:17:41,000
Like I get excited about being that
person that I've seen happen.

1881
01:17:41,001 --> 01:17:41,231
I'm like,
Oh,

1882
01:17:41,231 --> 01:17:44,300
I've seen people do that.
Get in better shape after 35.

1883
01:17:44,810 --> 01:17:48,260
I guess I can do it,
but there has to be thrilling,

1884
01:17:48,290 --> 01:17:49,850
but I can't,
you know,

1885
01:17:50,130 --> 01:17:50,963
it's,
it's getting there.

1886
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:53,430
You don't want it bad enough.
Rocky.

1887
01:17:53,450 --> 01:17:56,090
I now
I know,

1888
01:17:56,091 --> 01:17:57,980
I know.
There's no tomorrow.

1889
01:17:58,600 --> 01:17:59,480
It's my favorite quote.

1890
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:01,960
Yeah.
You know what you have to do.

1891
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:04,440
This is the big one for everybody.
For everybody listening,

1892
01:18:04,860 --> 01:18:08,340
write down shit you have to do.
But I do it.

1893
01:18:08,730 --> 01:18:10,950
I write down things I need to work on,
things I'm going to do.

1894
01:18:11,070 --> 01:18:13,650
Yeah.
Like I wrote down my schedule for the

1895
01:18:13,650 --> 01:18:15,450
week.
I wrote down like this week I'm going to

1896
01:18:15,451 --> 01:18:18,300
lift weights three days a week.
I'm going to run two days a week and I'm

1897
01:18:18,301 --> 01:18:20,280
gonna do yoga two days a week and
period.

1898
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:22,650
Like there's no,
no negotiation.

1899
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:25,440
So it has to do those things.
So that will,

1900
01:18:25,441 --> 01:18:29,100
I'll do that for the week and then I'll
make sure I make those checks off cause

1901
01:18:29,101 --> 01:18:30,990
there's a lot of times where I want to
fuck off,

1902
01:18:30,991 --> 01:18:33,780
but I know I have to make my schedule,
I have to get it in.

1903
01:18:34,140 --> 01:18:36,180
If I don't get it in,
then I fucked up.

1904
01:18:36,510 --> 01:18:41,190
Like I gave myself like a schedule and,
but then I get things done and it

1905
01:18:41,191 --> 01:18:43,500
doesn't seem any more stressful.
In fact,

1906
01:18:43,950 --> 01:18:47,970
it seems less stressful because I don't
have to like him and hall of whether I'm

1907
01:18:47,971 --> 01:18:50,100
going to do something.
Like I have it written down,

1908
01:18:50,101 --> 01:18:51,720
I have to do it and then I just go do
it.

1909
01:18:52,910 --> 01:18:53,743
Sounds,
uh,

1910
01:18:53,940 --> 01:18:56,340
I'll do that.
Then it's got to just write it down and

1911
01:18:56,341 --> 01:18:57,990
stick to the script.
Because as a comic,

1912
01:18:57,991 --> 01:19:02,991
one of the best things about us is that
we're impulsive and that we like to blow

1913
01:19:03,661 --> 01:19:07,650
things off shore and we like to question
the validity of certain actions.

1914
01:19:08,130 --> 01:19:09,210
Like,
why am I doing that?

1915
01:19:09,390 --> 01:19:10,430
Fuck that.
Oh,

1916
01:19:10,450 --> 01:19:13,230
how about I just jerk off and take a nap
or whatever you do.

1917
01:19:13,710 --> 01:19:15,120
You know?
I mean that's what we do.

1918
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:18,900
Will people were impulsive.
And that's one of the reasons why you're

1919
01:19:18,901 --> 01:19:21,960
funny cause you come up with a thought
that maybe other people wouldn't

1920
01:19:21,961 --> 01:19:22,794
entertain.

1921
01:19:23,970 --> 01:19:24,571
Yeah.
I mean I,

1922
01:19:24,571 --> 01:19:25,231
I,
you know,

1923
01:19:25,231 --> 01:19:26,700
it's,
it's just a mat once I'm,

1924
01:19:26,730 --> 01:19:28,050
once I'm in,
once I have,

1925
01:19:28,051 --> 01:19:30,030
once I got some downhill motion,
um,

1926
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:31,770
you know,
keep going.

1927
01:19:31,771 --> 01:19:33,120
Yeah.
That's the moment they,

1928
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:34,860
yeah,
that's the initial start.

1929
01:19:34,950 --> 01:19:37,920
I used to go boxing like every day for
years.

1930
01:19:37,970 --> 01:19:39,150
A few years.
You know,

1931
01:19:39,180 --> 01:19:42,430
that was when you were in New York right
now is that heroes go to the wild card

1932
01:19:42,570 --> 01:19:44,190
like everyday for like,
oh that's right.

1933
01:19:44,430 --> 01:19:45,210
And then,
uh,

1934
01:19:45,210 --> 01:19:47,640
Morgan Murphy is a big fucking boxing
fan.

1935
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:49,500
You,
you're not ever have conversations about

1936
01:19:49,501 --> 01:19:49,861
by,
you know,

1937
01:19:49,861 --> 01:19:50,810
a lot of shit.
I,

1938
01:19:50,811 --> 01:19:52,350
yeah,
I used to come and know more.

1939
01:19:52,351 --> 01:19:55,200
I mean I hit embarrassed with a,
it was sports stuff cause I'm such a

1940
01:19:55,590 --> 01:19:57,780
fan,
but I'm not a by any means a

1941
01:19:57,781 --> 01:19:59,370
statistician.
I'm not,

1942
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:02,310
uh,
a good remember of even names.

1943
01:20:02,311 --> 01:20:07,110
I just obsessive Lee Watch sports isn't
that hours and hours,

1944
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:08,010
hours a day.

1945
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:09,750
But isn't that funny though?
Like if you're talking about like a

1946
01:20:09,751 --> 01:20:11,450
television show,
like a,

1947
01:20:11,460 --> 01:20:12,630
yeah,
yeah,

1948
01:20:12,690 --> 01:20:14,020
I saw that show.
What,

1949
01:20:14,030 --> 01:20:15,660
wait a minute.
That's a good show.

1950
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:16,700
You know,
who is,

1951
01:20:16,850 --> 01:20:19,410
who is the main character in lost?
What was his name again?

1952
01:20:19,530 --> 01:20:20,440
And what was the,
you know,

1953
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:22,270
like there's no shame in that,
right?

1954
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:25,800
But a basketball game for the same time.
Like who was in the finals?

1955
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:26,560
Yeah,

1956
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:29,410
I think of like fights I've been to,
and then I can't even think of,

1957
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:30,790
I'm like,
I know who won the fight.

1958
01:20:30,791 --> 01:20:31,624
I don't,
I,

1959
01:20:31,830 --> 01:20:34,960
I don't even remember who they find
Kovalev Andre Ward this weekend.

1960
01:20:34,961 --> 01:20:36,520
I watched a little,
uh,

1961
01:20:36,610 --> 01:20:39,100
I listened to a lot about it,
but I missed it.

1962
01:20:39,580 --> 01:20:41,290
That's the other thing too,
is I've watched,

1963
01:20:41,291 --> 01:20:44,410
I stay home and watch so much shit.
I mean,

1964
01:20:44,411 --> 01:20:45,730
you know,
I love sports.

1965
01:20:45,731 --> 01:20:48,970
I find it to be the most soothing.
Like I,

1966
01:20:49,060 --> 01:20:50,650
I,
if I'm,

1967
01:20:50,651 --> 01:20:51,970
if I'm in a job,
you know,

1968
01:20:51,971 --> 01:20:54,030
writing something all day,
I look at my,

1969
01:20:54,090 --> 01:20:56,410
the sports schedule that night and I get
excited that,

1970
01:20:56,411 --> 01:20:57,730
oh,
I have a thing to do at eight.

1971
01:20:58,300 --> 01:20:59,680
You know,
after my work is done,

1972
01:20:59,681 --> 01:21:01,480
like I just,
I wrapped my days around it so I'm

1973
01:21:01,481 --> 01:21:06,481
trying to go out and do more shit as
opposed to being locked in a locked into

1974
01:21:06,821 --> 01:21:11,680
a schedule that uh,
determined by what slap boxing matches

1975
01:21:11,681 --> 01:21:13,090
on.
And I used to stay home to watch

1976
01:21:13,091 --> 01:21:15,310
everything and I didn't for that one.
Yeah,

1977
01:21:15,311 --> 01:21:16,144
I hear Ya.

1978
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:17,470
Okay.

1979
01:21:17,470 --> 01:21:18,760
You get,
you know,

1980
01:21:18,761 --> 01:21:19,960
it comes in waves.
Right.

1981
01:21:20,170 --> 01:21:21,490
But I listened to the,
I mean I,

1982
01:21:21,491 --> 01:21:22,150
you know,
I've,

1983
01:21:22,150 --> 01:21:24,220
I have opinions about it having not seen
it,

1984
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:25,290
which is

1985
01:21:25,290 --> 01:21:29,520
you still have opinions like uneducated
ones from whatnot just from watching

1986
01:21:29,521 --> 01:21:31,640
what I eat from seeing what I did see.
I feel like it was like,

1987
01:21:31,641 --> 01:21:34,340
I like I get mad about certain
stoppages.

1988
01:21:34,470 --> 01:21:35,940
Oh really?
Like what did you see?

1989
01:21:35,941 --> 01:21:37,250
The Kovalev Ward?
Yeah.

1990
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:40,070
And I taught it was an early stoppage,
definitely narrowly stoppage.

1991
01:21:40,110 --> 01:21:41,220
I don't think he felt that this
shouldn't,

1992
01:21:41,230 --> 01:21:43,230
someone's on his way down.
Here's the question though.

1993
01:21:43,260 --> 01:21:46,770
Did he have a standing eight count rule?
Like I don't know if there's a standing

1994
01:21:46,771 --> 01:21:50,400
eight count rule in that fight.
I could see if there was find out if

1995
01:21:50,401 --> 01:21:51,640
there was,
there was,

1996
01:21:51,641 --> 01:21:54,300
cause I feel like that's what should
have happened if it happened.

1997
01:21:54,301 --> 01:21:56,460
But in some fights,
I believe they don't have to have a

1998
01:21:56,461 --> 01:21:58,530
standing eight count that correct me if
I'm wrong.

1999
01:21:59,070 --> 01:22:00,900
I don't think that's the case in all
fights.

2000
01:22:00,901 --> 01:22:03,630
And I think in some championship fights,
they don't have a standing eight count.

2001
01:22:04,110 --> 01:22:07,070
And I think that's a speculator or a
specification,

2002
01:22:07,071 --> 01:22:07,904
right?
They put,

2003
01:22:08,050 --> 01:22:08,611
yeah,
that,

2004
01:22:08,611 --> 01:22:10,260
I don't know.
I just seems like an obvious

2005
01:22:10,261 --> 01:22:11,094
stipulation.
Ah,

2006
01:22:11,180 --> 01:22:11,410
yeah.

2007
01:22:11,410 --> 01:22:14,020
I mean,
the last fight,

2008
01:22:14,380 --> 01:22:16,780
I'm trying to think of a Jamie,
you'll find out.

2009
01:22:16,781 --> 01:22:19,900
Jane Doe.
I made a,

2010
01:22:19,990 --> 01:22:21,310
I made,
uh,

2011
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:22,530
I was in,
uh,

2012
01:22:22,530 --> 01:22:24,580
Arizona during the Canelo,
uh,

2013
01:22:24,670 --> 01:22:28,690
the Chavez fight and I made everybody
watch it and then that wasn't a good

2014
01:22:28,691 --> 01:22:29,800
one.
It was a bad one.

2015
01:22:29,801 --> 01:22:34,120
And it was the worst part about it was
that everyone knew I was the reason the

2016
01:22:34,121 --> 01:22:35,770
fight was on.
Oh No.

2017
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:37,270
So everyone,
it was a,

2018
01:22:37,271 --> 01:22:40,420
it was like I couldn't,
every round I wanted to be exciting

2019
01:22:40,421 --> 01:22:43,990
because I wanted people to not get mad
at me for ruining their night,

2020
01:22:44,860 --> 01:22:47,530
but instead I was responsible for a
boring night.

2021
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:50,290
And then I was like,
I enjoyed it.

2022
01:22:51,130 --> 01:22:53,270
Even though it was boring.
I just wanted to see who was going to

2023
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:56,080
fight Golovkin and that was my,
that was my sort of,

2024
01:22:56,200 --> 01:23:00,340
you know,
my horse in the race was whoever was

2025
01:23:00,341 --> 01:23:01,020
going to win.

2026
01:23:01,020 --> 01:23:02,040
Right.
My favorite fighter.

2027
01:23:02,070 --> 01:23:05,070
But most people thought Canelo was gonna
win.

2028
01:23:05,340 --> 01:23:07,360
Handly but that was the problem was that
like,

2029
01:23:07,361 --> 01:23:09,490
Chavez didn't really want to put himself
out there,

2030
01:23:10,270 --> 01:23:12,970
risking a great [inaudible].
He's never been,

2031
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:13,833
uh,
uh,

2032
01:23:14,390 --> 01:23:16,510
I don't think it's trainings ever been,
um,

2033
01:23:16,940 --> 01:23:21,760
as disciplined as some,
like Canelo is about that life.

2034
01:23:21,780 --> 01:23:22,300
Yeah.
Right.

2035
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:24,350
I mean,
he's trying to be the best ever and just

2036
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:25,720
trying to be the best.
It's hard to be.

2037
01:23:25,721 --> 01:23:28,120
I tend to mean her being a,
being a rich kid.

2038
01:23:28,121 --> 01:23:31,180
Boxer just feels like a born rich kid.
Well,

2039
01:23:31,181 --> 01:23:32,320
I mean,
Chavez Jr,

2040
01:23:32,321 --> 01:23:32,990
I mean,
he's,

2041
01:23:32,990 --> 01:23:34,000
oh,
sorry,

2042
01:23:34,001 --> 01:23:34,710
my canal.
No,

2043
01:23:34,710 --> 01:23:34,991
no,
no,

2044
01:23:34,991 --> 01:23:36,010
no.
I was just saying that,

2045
01:23:36,070 --> 01:23:37,120
uh,
you know,

2046
01:23:37,210 --> 01:23:40,540
just that just seems like a hard place
to come from.

2047
01:23:40,570 --> 01:23:41,640
Oh yeah.
And he's,

2048
01:23:41,660 --> 01:23:43,750
you know,
his dad is the fucking greatest of all

2049
01:23:43,751 --> 01:23:46,990
time.
Julio Cesar Chavez is arguably the

2050
01:23:46,991 --> 01:23:48,670
greatest Mexican fighter of all time.

2051
01:23:48,850 --> 01:23:49,181
I mean,
he's,

2052
01:23:49,181 --> 01:23:50,460
he's up there.
I saw it,

2053
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:53,620
I saw Chavez Jr fight and um,
at the staples center and they brought

2054
01:23:53,621 --> 01:23:55,180
his dad out first and I was like,
I was like,

2055
01:23:55,181 --> 01:23:55,601
oh,
I was like,

2056
01:23:55,601 --> 01:23:58,810
just the poor shadow you got to be and
that your dad gets honored before your

2057
01:23:58,811 --> 01:23:59,740
fights.
Rough.

2058
01:24:00,190 --> 01:24:03,910
But you know what,
there's this Guy Kron Gracie and his dad

2059
01:24:03,911 --> 01:24:07,210
is Hixon Gracie who's like the greatest
Jujitsu guy of all time.

2060
01:24:07,540 --> 01:24:09,020
And the sun is a world champion.
Yeah.

2061
01:24:09,100 --> 01:24:11,680
Fucking beast.
And he's one of the best guys on the

2062
01:24:11,681 --> 01:24:16,150
planet earth.
Like legitimately 100% self motivated,

2063
01:24:16,390 --> 01:24:17,500
not like,
you know,

2064
01:24:17,501 --> 01:24:20,230
it doesn't need to,
it's not like the same sort of Chavez

2065
01:24:20,231 --> 01:24:21,130
situation.
Right.

2066
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:25,320
So it doesn't always happen that way,
but it seems like fighting in general,

2067
01:24:25,321 --> 01:24:28,000
younger for fighting tends to come from
a place of poverty.

2068
01:24:28,001 --> 01:24:28,840
I mean,
it tends to,

2069
01:24:28,841 --> 01:24:29,674
yeah,
but again,

2070
01:24:29,690 --> 01:24:30,420
it doesn't have to.

2071
01:24:30,420 --> 01:24:30,680
No,
no,

2072
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:31,301
no.
But I mean,

2073
01:24:31,301 --> 01:24:33,610
even like even it and Mary,
like,

2074
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:34,300
you know,
uh,

2075
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:35,200
oh,
what was his name?

2076
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:37,150
It's like rust belt dude.
Uh,

2077
01:24:37,860 --> 01:24:38,800
rustbelt nail.
Yeah,

2078
01:24:38,801 --> 01:24:41,440
the guy a this an American dude who,
uh,

2079
01:24:41,830 --> 01:24:43,690
I always forget when,
I can't remember his name.

2080
01:24:44,350 --> 01:24:46,840
He's from Molly Pavlik.
Was it Kelly?

2081
01:24:46,841 --> 01:24:47,121
Yeah.
Yeah,

2082
01:24:47,121 --> 01:24:47,690
yeah.
Right.

2083
01:24:47,690 --> 01:24:50,340
Am I wrong when I shave?
I shaved head.

2084
01:24:50,380 --> 01:24:51,520
Yeah.
I had a moment.

2085
01:24:51,521 --> 01:24:53,290
Bad motherfucker.
Bad motherfucker.

2086
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:56,980
He just ran into Bernard Hopkins.
Bernard Hopkins had them figured out.

2087
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:59,730
Just tuned him up.
Yeah.

2088
01:24:59,731 --> 01:25:02,230
I like it.
Brought a blog article about that,

2089
01:25:02,650 --> 01:25:04,420
about that fight,
because it was just a masterful

2090
01:25:04,421 --> 01:25:08,740
performance by Hopkins Hopkins.
I was actually coming home from a UFC

2091
01:25:08,741 --> 01:25:11,440
fight overseas.
I was in Europe when I watched that

2092
01:25:11,441 --> 01:25:14,140
fight and I was like,
that motherfucker.

2093
01:25:14,141 --> 01:25:15,630
So good.
I kind of,

2094
01:25:15,631 --> 01:25:18,940
so smarty,
I've been watching,

2095
01:25:19,030 --> 01:25:21,180
I've been watching,
but I've written for,

2096
01:25:21,610 --> 01:25:22,570
Oh,
you root for people.

2097
01:25:22,570 --> 01:25:24,130
I just like,
I don't know who,

2098
01:25:24,250 --> 01:25:25,330
I don't know who,
who's who.

2099
01:25:25,331 --> 01:25:29,170
I feel I have,
I think wide just started even watching

2100
01:25:29,171 --> 01:25:31,030
hockey.
It's like I played so many sports as a

2101
01:25:31,031 --> 01:25:32,800
kid.
Like I can get into the sports I know

2102
01:25:32,801 --> 01:25:35,260
about,
but when I don't know anything about it,

2103
01:25:35,261 --> 01:25:36,500
it's like,
it's like we're going out to like do

2104
01:25:36,501 --> 01:25:39,100
anything else.
I'm uncomfortable getting into something

2105
01:25:39,101 --> 01:25:42,490
that I come from such a,
I have such a huge blind spot about.

2106
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:43,593
Right.
I don't know.

2107
01:25:43,670 --> 01:25:45,220
I'm just like,
how am I going to learn everything?

2108
01:25:45,221 --> 01:25:47,530
Immediately I tried to get Ian Edwards
to school.

2109
01:25:47,531 --> 01:25:51,280
Me On soccer.
I didn't last a few weeks.

2110
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:53,530
We've been talking about doing a soccer
companion.

2111
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:57,430
He took me to a bar once and we're
sitting there watching some games,

2112
01:25:57,431 --> 01:25:59,860
like some big time soccer game.
It was pretty good.

2113
01:25:59,930 --> 01:26:02,170
It was fun.
It's fun being next to Ian because he

2114
01:26:02,171 --> 01:26:05,240
knows everything.
He knows as much about soccer's.

2115
01:26:05,270 --> 01:26:09,170
I know about mma.
He just rattling off who this guy is and

2116
01:26:09,171 --> 01:26:11,370
what this team is about and what their
scores,

2117
01:26:11,390 --> 01:26:14,240
and he has a soccer podcast too,
that he does.

2118
01:26:14,241 --> 01:26:15,950
I forget who does it.
What do you remember who he does it

2119
01:26:15,951 --> 01:26:16,784
with?

2120
01:26:17,970 --> 01:26:19,310
I love that dude.
I love him.

2121
01:26:19,370 --> 01:26:21,050
He's the best.
Such a nice guy.

2122
01:26:21,051 --> 01:26:23,190
He's the most underrated comic alive
today.

2123
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:23,721
So funny.
I,

2124
01:26:23,721 --> 01:26:25,700
you know,
I quoted a joke of his and a in the

2125
01:26:25,701 --> 01:26:27,740
writer's room at two broke girls and my
boss was like,

2126
01:26:28,190 --> 01:26:30,410
his joke is that,
and I was like Ian Edwards and he hired

2127
01:26:30,411 --> 01:26:32,030
him.
Great move.

2128
01:26:32,060 --> 01:26:32,691
Yeah,
it was like,

2129
01:26:32,691 --> 01:26:33,830
it was a,
it was,

2130
01:26:34,140 --> 01:26:35,150
but it was just like,
oh yeah,

2131
01:26:35,151 --> 01:26:37,160
the end's got this joke and everyone was
fucking dying.

2132
01:26:37,220 --> 01:26:40,130
I selfishly don't want anybody to ever
hire him as a writer again.

2133
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:42,710
I want them to just do standup.
I think that's what he's doing.

2134
01:26:42,711 --> 01:26:45,140
I mean,
I think he just was a little short Gig,

2135
01:26:45,141 --> 01:26:45,741
but yeah,
no,

2136
01:26:45,741 --> 01:26:48,980
he does them every now and then,
but I just feel like people don't know

2137
01:26:48,981 --> 01:26:50,840
how fucking good he is.
He's so good.

2138
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:53,450
He's,
and he's such a good guy.

2139
01:26:53,530 --> 01:26:56,090
Yeah.
Just one of the best guys ever.

2140
01:26:57,540 --> 01:26:59,250
True.
What do you think about this conor

2141
01:26:59,251 --> 01:27:00,570
mcgregor?
Floyd mayweather fight.

2142
01:27:01,230 --> 01:27:02,730
I mean,
it's a spectacle.

2143
01:27:02,731 --> 01:27:04,280
I guess I'm excited.
Uh,

2144
01:27:04,350 --> 01:27:06,720
I'm excited about it,
but I feel like it's going to be another

2145
01:27:06,721 --> 01:27:09,360
big notch and I may,
whether spelt and I don't think he needs

2146
01:27:09,361 --> 01:27:11,220
another one.
Like I just,

2147
01:27:11,221 --> 01:27:12,790
I get a little bit,
ah,

2148
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:13,820
I get it.
I,

2149
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:15,920
I respectful.
I May,

2150
01:27:15,921 --> 01:27:18,540
whether it's a boxer,
but it's not the kind of boxing I get

2151
01:27:18,541 --> 01:27:21,930
excited about watching,
even though I know it's technically,

2152
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:23,640
you know,
it's going amazing.

2153
01:27:23,700 --> 01:27:25,210
It's going to be a boxing match.
Yeah,

2154
01:27:25,350 --> 01:27:27,780
for sure.
It's going to be an actual 12 round

2155
01:27:27,781 --> 01:27:29,610
boxing match,
so we're going to get to see some sort

2156
01:27:29,611 --> 01:27:32,040
of an athletic competition.
Um,

2157
01:27:32,070 --> 01:27:34,110
but yeah,
sorry,

2158
01:27:34,111 --> 01:27:36,120
I just don't,
I don't see how mcgregor can

2159
01:27:36,930 --> 01:27:41,190
be better than the best boxers in the
world who have tried.

2160
01:27:41,580 --> 01:27:42,413
Yeah.
He won't be,

2161
01:27:42,660 --> 01:27:44,790
he won't be better than the best boxers
in the world,

2162
01:27:44,850 --> 01:27:47,310
but what he might do,
first of all,

2163
01:27:47,311 --> 01:27:49,230
he's definitely gonna make it exciting.
It's going to,

2164
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:51,810
the trash talk is going to be fucking
as,

2165
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:55,320
it's going to be epic.
It's going to be a fun Spec to go and he

2166
01:27:55,321 --> 01:28:00,030
has legitimate scary one punch power and
he's way bigger.

2167
01:28:00,210 --> 01:28:02,640
So it's all about whether or not he
could hit me.

2168
01:28:02,641 --> 01:28:05,610
Whether she has a at one 50 something.
I don't know.

2169
01:28:05,611 --> 01:28:08,850
That's a good question too.
How much weight does he have to lose?

2170
01:28:08,851 --> 01:28:11,700
How much is in and make them dehydrate
himself even give a fuck.

2171
01:28:11,701 --> 01:28:15,840
Does he ever even when respect is skills
enough to make them dehydrate himself

2172
01:28:15,841 --> 01:28:19,140
like he did with Canelo cause he made
Canelo cut a shitload of weight.

2173
01:28:19,170 --> 01:28:21,120
Sure.
I think he made a fight at one 50.

2174
01:28:21,121 --> 01:28:22,920
Is that correct?
File what?

2175
01:28:22,921 --> 01:28:26,340
Floyd mayweather made Canelo Alvarez
fight because Canelo Canelo's a big

2176
01:28:26,341 --> 01:28:28,030
fella.
I've seen him in person.

2177
01:28:28,060 --> 01:28:29,940
Him getting down into one fifty's a
rough,

2178
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,820
rough suck.
I think that,

2179
01:28:32,821 --> 01:28:34,920
um,
it's always scary when you look at these

2180
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:37,470
days and they just look amazing.
Macy ate it before the tariff.

2181
01:28:37,490 --> 01:28:39,090
Like Chavez,
I mean,

2182
01:28:39,110 --> 01:28:40,110
you know,
was a tall guy.

2183
01:28:40,111 --> 01:28:44,610
So he's one of the worst I ever saw was
when connor made it to one 45 we fought

2184
01:28:44,611 --> 01:28:46,440
Aldo.
It's like Jesus Christ.

2185
01:28:46,890 --> 01:28:51,270
Like he looks so gone and dried up at
the Wayans and then the next day it

2186
01:28:51,271 --> 01:28:52,460
looks like a go real

2187
01:28:54,710 --> 01:28:59,710
canelo came in at one 52 it says,
and this fight is at one 54 it is at one

2188
01:28:59,781 --> 01:29:01,590
54 that's what they're making it.
Interesting.

2189
01:29:01,620 --> 01:29:03,540
Okay,
well connor's not going to have a hard

2190
01:29:03,541 --> 01:29:08,400
time making the one 54 now this says
Canelo weighed in at one 68 no,

2191
01:29:08,401 --> 01:29:11,040
that was his last fight with Chavez jr
or Chavez Jr.

2192
01:29:11,070 --> 01:29:14,220
He fought above his weight class,
actually Chavez Jr I think it was

2193
01:29:14,221 --> 01:29:17,370
fighting once 75 wasn't he?
And he came down,

2194
01:29:17,430 --> 01:29:20,130
maybe they,
maybe it was a normal weight for Chavez

2195
01:29:20,130 --> 01:29:22,590
Jr just for the 30 day weigh.
And when he fought me with her,

2196
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:28,160
oh it was 30 30 days out.
One 66.8 yeah.

2197
01:29:28,830 --> 01:29:30,720
Well they had stipulations in the
contract,

2198
01:29:30,721 --> 01:29:32,640
like how big he could be at certain
points,

2199
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:34,170
you know,
sturdy.

2200
01:29:34,410 --> 01:29:37,080
They just wanted to dry them out.
What's the,

2201
01:29:38,160 --> 01:29:40,670
what's the whole a cargill?
I mean is it,

2202
01:29:40,740 --> 01:29:42,480
are they going to have all boxing?

2203
01:29:42,630 --> 01:29:47,630
Because it's a good question.
I think the only way to fight is going

2204
01:29:48,121 --> 01:29:52,560
to be interesting skill wise is if
connor figures out a way to a mall him,

2205
01:29:53,070 --> 01:29:55,500
he's almost got to like close the
distance quick,

2206
01:29:55,530 --> 01:29:59,850
get him up against the ropes and just
hit him with like shots while he's

2207
01:29:59,851 --> 01:30:04,440
holding them.
He's almost got to clip him in some sort

2208
01:30:04,441 --> 01:30:08,550
of weird awkward like my Donna like
exchange ever seen a fight with my

2209
01:30:08,551 --> 01:30:09,480
donald,
a floyd hat.

2210
01:30:09,481 --> 01:30:13,260
But Floyd got clipped by a big overhand
right.

2211
01:30:13,261 --> 01:30:15,300
I think it was at the end of one of the
rounds,

2212
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:18,510
like very end of the round,
his legs dip like Whoa.

2213
01:30:18,511 --> 01:30:19,530
A little Jig,
a little,

2214
01:30:19,531 --> 01:30:23,610
a little wobbly and it's just because he
got mauled.

2215
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:27,390
It wasn't because skill wise he was
commensurate and then when floyd came

2216
01:30:27,391 --> 01:30:29,700
back in the rematch,
he just boxed his face off.

2217
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:33,090
Just fucked him up because he just
wanted to let them know like,

2218
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:35,520
look dude,
I barely took you serious in that first

2219
01:30:35,521 --> 01:30:37,320
fight.
It got close.

2220
01:30:37,321 --> 01:30:40,680
But it only got close cause like the
sloppy bra and then you just put a skill

2221
01:30:40,681 --> 01:30:43,020
clinic on them.
And the second fight sacrifice wasn't

2222
01:30:43,021 --> 01:30:46,320
even close.
I think that that's the only con,

2223
01:30:46,350 --> 01:30:49,770
but that's not how connor normally fight
sound like a swarming face.

2224
01:30:49,771 --> 01:30:51,850
First brawler type dude.
He's a guy,

2225
01:30:51,851 --> 01:30:54,940
he's like cautious about getting hit and
I'm,

2226
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:57,170
I'm thrilled about it but I'm also a,
I,

2227
01:30:57,171 --> 01:30:58,290
I,
I wish,

2228
01:30:58,380 --> 01:31:01,800
I wish I,
I wish I knew more about your side of

2229
01:31:01,801 --> 01:31:04,410
the tracks.
Well we don't know enough about connor

2230
01:31:04,411 --> 01:31:07,020
because connor has never had a
professional boxing match.

2231
01:31:07,680 --> 01:31:09,780
You know,
and the thing is you see a striking,

2232
01:31:09,781 --> 01:31:13,260
but you only see striking when he's
working on kicks and wrestling and all

2233
01:31:13,261 --> 01:31:14,094
that other shit too.

2234
01:31:14,110 --> 01:31:15,870
Just kicked him.
Like would that,

2235
01:31:15,871 --> 01:31:19,080
I mean just,
it just didn't do it just to let them

2236
01:31:19,081 --> 01:31:22,650
know to do it would be fucked up.
He fucked up.

2237
01:31:22,651 --> 01:31:24,600
But it would be hilarious.
Well after you'd probably,

2238
01:31:24,601 --> 01:31:26,620
there's probably some stipulations in
the contract and say,

2239
01:31:26,650 --> 01:31:30,260
can't get them in an arm bar or choke
him.

2240
01:31:30,830 --> 01:31:32,990
Just kicking him in the head and knocked
him out.

2241
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,660
Would be worth losing all the money and
then getting more money out.

2242
01:31:35,661 --> 01:31:39,120
Can you imagine?
He would be a god damn folk hero if they

2243
01:31:39,121 --> 01:31:42,090
got in close,
if they got any clothes and floyd was

2244
01:31:42,091 --> 01:31:46,260
like sucking and Juke on the outside and
he threw a jab to cover up our left high

2245
01:31:46,261 --> 01:31:48,720
kick and that left high kick.
Next I'm just,

2246
01:31:50,010 --> 01:31:52,620
and you see floyd go limp and he would
go limp.

2247
01:31:53,070 --> 01:31:58,070
He'd never been high kicked like that.
Jesus taught it'd be crazy cause if he

2248
01:31:58,531 --> 01:32:00,010
didn't know it was yeah

2249
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:02,530
he could clip them with it.
Like if he had no idea.

2250
01:32:02,531 --> 01:32:06,370
If you hid a kick behind a punch like
fighter is a lot of fighters do to like

2251
01:32:06,371 --> 01:32:09,100
throw a punch,
literally a cover your face so the kick

2252
01:32:09,101 --> 01:32:13,540
is behind it already and then boom,
the kit comes like while your vision is

2253
01:32:13,541 --> 01:32:15,340
already,
you're thinking about the next punch and

2254
01:32:15,341 --> 01:32:18,220
bang the kick lands and you get chaos
happens all the time.

2255
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:20,350
If he did that,
that would be insane.

2256
01:32:20,830 --> 01:32:24,760
What have you are worth it?
It would be with fuck everything up

2257
01:32:25,300 --> 01:32:29,290
because no one would ever trust another
fighter from mma to ever fight a boxer

2258
01:32:29,291 --> 01:32:31,680
in a boxing match again,
cause we've only had the up.

2259
01:32:31,750 --> 01:32:33,250
The opposite happened.
Really?

2260
01:32:34,420 --> 01:32:38,500
We could they after this,
could they do an MMA fight?

2261
01:32:38,770 --> 01:32:40,470
But the two of them,
no,

2262
01:32:40,890 --> 01:32:41,730
no,
no.

2263
01:32:42,750 --> 01:32:44,490
Got It.
With last 30 seconds,

2264
01:32:44,580 --> 01:32:47,340
maximum relax.
If Connor wanted to give them an ear

2265
01:32:47,341 --> 01:32:49,020
beating for 28 minutes,
seconds.

2266
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:52,680
Look,
connors so much better as a wrestler,

2267
01:32:52,681 --> 01:32:55,320
as a submission.
Artists as a kicker.

2268
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:59,040
There's just no way he'll,
he'll hit him with spinning elbows and

2269
01:32:59,041 --> 01:33:01,500
shit.
Like there's things you can't do in a

2270
01:33:01,501 --> 01:33:06,000
boxing match that you're not expecting
and if someone's just kicks your legs

2271
01:33:06,001 --> 01:33:07,290
once,
you're going to be like,

2272
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:08,910
oh my God,
what the fuck?

2273
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:09,660
Now

2274
01:33:09,660 --> 01:33:12,540
I'm just trying to think of a way to
make money out of a,

2275
01:33:12,541 --> 01:33:13,590
out of what's going on.
I mean,

2276
01:33:13,591 --> 01:33:16,680
you know what's going to come at
hundreds and hundreds and millions of

2277
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:16,991
dollars.
Yeah,

2278
01:33:16,991 --> 01:33:17,910
right.
I said only way.

2279
01:33:17,940 --> 01:33:18,680
This is the only way,

2280
01:33:18,680 --> 01:33:21,240
but this is a giant big difference
though.

2281
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:24,390
Floyd would have to learn how to fight
MMA style.

2282
01:33:24,570 --> 01:33:28,080
Who would have to learn how the Stop
takedowns cause I have to learn how to

2283
01:33:28,081 --> 01:33:31,410
check leg kicks and you'd have to learn
how to defend submissions and that will

2284
01:33:31,411 --> 01:33:33,270
take years.
And he's not going to do that at 40

2285
01:33:33,271 --> 01:33:35,160
years old.
I don't know what he knows now as far as

2286
01:33:35,161 --> 01:33:38,940
wrestling defense and what he knows
about kickboxing or Jujitsu or anything

2287
01:33:38,941 --> 01:33:39,990
else.
I don't know what he knows,

2288
01:33:40,260 --> 01:33:45,240
but if he knows nothing,
he's 100% fucked 100% bet.

2289
01:33:45,241 --> 01:33:49,830
The House on it fucked.
Like connor might win a boxing match.

2290
01:33:49,831 --> 01:33:54,720
I mean maybe there's like a,
a small percentage chance that he just

2291
01:33:54,721 --> 01:33:58,740
runs in there and clips floyd with a big
shot and rock some and then takes him

2292
01:33:58,741 --> 01:34:00,450
out.
I don't know what that percentage is,

2293
01:34:00,451 --> 01:34:04,920
but if you ask a boxing expert,
there's like 4% 5% right.

2294
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:06,900
That's what a boxing expert would say,
which I'm not.

2295
01:34:07,110 --> 01:34:09,990
But I'm an MMA expert,
and if they fought in an MMA fight,

2296
01:34:09,991 --> 01:34:14,991
it's 100% the connor would fuck him up
100% no ifs,

2297
01:34:15,540 --> 01:34:17,160
no ands,
no buts,

2298
01:34:17,250 --> 01:34:18,870
no chance,
no chance.

2299
01:34:19,160 --> 01:34:22,080
It's connor is going to be farther away
from me with him than anyone has ever

2300
01:34:22,081 --> 01:34:23,940
hit him.
And he's going to be kicking him in the

2301
01:34:23,941 --> 01:34:25,500
stomach,
in the legs,

2302
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:28,110
and it'll soften him up in the rounds or
five minutes long.

2303
01:34:28,290 --> 01:34:31,950
And eventually he gets a clinch.
And when he gets a clinch may whether is

2304
01:34:31,951 --> 01:34:34,230
fucked,
he's going to the ground,

2305
01:34:34,231 --> 01:34:36,390
he's not going to be able to stop,
but he's going to get mounted.

2306
01:34:36,391 --> 01:34:39,840
He's gonna get elbows force fed into his
eye socket,

2307
01:34:39,960 --> 01:34:42,060
his nose,
his mouth,

2308
01:34:42,210 --> 01:34:44,640
his jaw,
the sides of his head,

2309
01:34:44,641 --> 01:34:47,430
his ears.
He's going to get elbowed in the ear.

2310
01:34:47,610 --> 01:34:51,510
He's going to get punches dropped down
on him when he's totally pinned down and

2311
01:34:51,511 --> 01:34:54,300
defenseless,
he's going to have a knee on one of his

2312
01:34:54,301 --> 01:34:57,170
biceps.
While those guys literally on top of him

2313
01:34:57,230 --> 01:34:59,750
pounding him in the face and he won't be
able to get up do,

2314
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:02,270
you won't be able to stop the crucifix.
You won't be able to stop anything.

2315
01:35:02,271 --> 01:35:06,620
He'll be tied up and smashed on the
ground until he decides to choke him,

2316
01:35:06,980 --> 01:35:09,020
so he's big.
You'll be completely defenseless.

2317
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:13,510
So in that sense,
the odds would be insane if mayweather

2318
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:16,040
decided in the next two months because
the fight is going to take place in

2319
01:35:16,041 --> 01:35:17,990
August.
If he decided in the next two months,

2320
01:35:18,030 --> 01:35:19,770
which by the way,
I feel like as soon am I wrong,

2321
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:20,820
I feel like it's too right.

2322
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:21,890
It's very quick.
It's not.

2323
01:35:21,891 --> 01:35:24,320
Maybe it's on too soon.
Maybe they'd been negotiating for a long

2324
01:35:24,321 --> 01:35:27,440
time,
but at least connor knows something

2325
01:35:27,770 --> 01:35:32,210
about boxing or this could be a thing,
but if they just took it from now and

2326
01:35:32,211 --> 01:35:32,990
said,
tomorrow,

2327
01:35:32,990 --> 01:35:34,490
two months from now,
you're going to have an MMA fight.

2328
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:39,020
Holy Shit.
The odds would be 100,000 to one like if

2329
01:35:39,021 --> 01:35:41,720
you ask like any real MMA expert,
they'd be like,

2330
01:35:41,870 --> 01:35:42,890
how fucked is he?
Oh,

2331
01:35:42,891 --> 01:35:45,570
he's 100% fucked,
hundred percent fucked.

2332
01:35:45,890 --> 01:35:49,190
And boxing experts think that mayweather
is 100% fucked,

2333
01:35:49,550 --> 01:35:51,890
but they'll give him a forced smile.
Slight chance.

2334
01:35:51,891 --> 01:35:53,230
You never know.
It's crazy people.

2335
01:35:53,231 --> 01:35:54,290
It's throwing punches.
You never know.

2336
01:35:54,291 --> 01:35:56,870
Cause may mayweather can throw a punch
for sure.

2337
01:35:56,990 --> 01:35:59,000
And Connor Control Punch for sure.
Right.

2338
01:35:59,030 --> 01:36:00,500
Who knows what happens.
Who knows?

2339
01:36:00,501 --> 01:36:02,610
Most likely though me whether outboxes
on,

2340
01:36:02,750 --> 01:36:05,110
but you could see con and landing
something could be crazy.

2341
01:36:05,370 --> 01:36:07,440
It's [inaudible].
He's just the hardest person to light.

2342
01:36:07,450 --> 01:36:08,550
It's not just that he's the greatest
guy.

2343
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:10,380
He's a,
he's the hardest person to land a punch

2344
01:36:10,381 --> 01:36:11,460
against.
That's why it sounds it.

2345
01:36:11,470 --> 01:36:12,540
Yeah.
It just,

2346
01:36:13,140 --> 01:36:15,060
he's the best defensive boxer ever.
Yeah.

2347
01:36:15,090 --> 01:36:17,250
That's why it's morning.
It's not too,

2348
01:36:17,310 --> 01:36:18,480
I mean it is,
it is,

2349
01:36:18,540 --> 01:36:21,510
but I don't find it boring on a
technical level.

2350
01:36:21,511 --> 01:36:25,860
I find it boring unlike a social,
like I liked the social element around a

2351
01:36:25,861 --> 01:36:28,950
fight and the excitement and yeah,
it's very good way to put it.

2352
01:36:29,250 --> 01:36:30,450
It's,
it's not a good,

2353
01:36:30,690 --> 01:36:32,610
he's not like the best,
you know,

2354
01:36:32,611 --> 01:36:35,070
you can't look at your pizza while
you're eating it cause you've got to

2355
01:36:35,071 --> 01:36:37,050
keep your eye on the screen.
Like it's like a Tyson fight.

2356
01:36:37,080 --> 01:36:37,913
Yeah.

2357
01:36:38,030 --> 01:36:40,880
Yeah.
Tyson was the best example of in a lot

2358
01:36:40,881 --> 01:36:45,290
of ways what was wrong with people
liking boxing?

2359
01:36:45,590 --> 01:36:47,210
Cause I just want to see someone get
slaughtered.

2360
01:36:47,230 --> 01:36:48,063
Sure.
You know,

2361
01:36:48,260 --> 01:36:52,490
and then Arturo Gotti and micky ward is
like the other side of it.

2362
01:36:52,491 --> 01:36:55,820
It's like neither guy can slaughter the
other guy and they keep slaughtering

2363
01:36:55,821 --> 01:37:00,230
each other and coming back like that's,
that to me is always been my favorite

2364
01:37:00,231 --> 01:37:04,640
kind of fight in torn personally because
I know how dangerous it is for them

2365
01:37:04,770 --> 01:37:07,890
cause it's such a horrible,
horrible experience for their body.

2366
01:37:07,891 --> 01:37:10,190
Just exchanging punch after punch after
punch.

2367
01:37:10,610 --> 01:37:15,610
A guy named Tim Hague,
just died this past weekend and he was a

2368
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:18,730
former UFC fighter who,
uh,

2369
01:37:18,860 --> 01:37:22,670
lost in the UFC and then went over and
was fighting a bunch of other

2370
01:37:22,671 --> 01:37:27,020
organizations and he sustained a series
of pretty brutal knockouts,

2371
01:37:27,021 --> 01:37:30,230
like boxing thing that wasn't at a
boxing acts like a he,

2372
01:37:30,231 --> 01:37:34,880
so he fought a bunch of mma fights,
had gotten knocked out many times and

2373
01:37:34,881 --> 01:37:37,880
then went in just two months after a
lot.

2374
01:37:37,930 --> 01:37:40,160
Well,
a big knockout that he just had an April

2375
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:44,000
fought a boxing match.
So he had been knocked out in April,

2376
01:37:44,170 --> 01:37:46,340
I believe it was April.
I'm sorry if I'm wrong.

2377
01:37:46,670 --> 01:37:47,960
Um,
that's what I read.

2378
01:37:48,020 --> 01:37:52,160
And then he's fighting again in this
boxing match and he's outmatch it takes

2379
01:37:52,161 --> 01:37:54,650
his fight on short notice against her
really good boxer.

2380
01:37:55,050 --> 01:37:58,620
I think he has like a one and three
boxing record someplace that's not a

2381
01:37:58,621 --> 01:38:02,760
good boxing record.
And this guy just fucked him up and bad

2382
01:38:02,790 --> 01:38:05,400
and the Kao was brutal.
He apparently got knocked down several

2383
01:38:05,401 --> 01:38:10,401
times in the first round and uh,
and he got hit with some big bombs and

2384
01:38:11,071 --> 01:38:14,400
dropped in his head,
bounced off the ground and he died.

2385
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:18,210
And it,
it is a very rare thing for someone to

2386
01:38:18,211 --> 01:38:20,190
die in boxing in the heavyweight
division.

2387
01:38:20,700 --> 01:38:25,200
It's usually the guys who dehydrate
themselves and then come into a fight

2388
01:38:25,201 --> 01:38:26,250
like really light.

2389
01:38:26,790 --> 01:38:29,850
Those are the ones that usually die.
So this is pretty rare.

2390
01:38:30,290 --> 01:38:34,230
There was like a serious beating in a
fight between um,

2391
01:38:34,710 --> 01:38:38,630
that really bad ass Cuban guy,
a southpaw,

2392
01:38:38,650 --> 01:38:39,840
uh,
big,

2393
01:38:40,020 --> 01:38:41,820
uh,
something.

2394
01:38:41,821 --> 01:38:45,570
Louise see if you could fit.
He's a top contender right now,

2395
01:38:45,571 --> 01:38:49,290
boxing in the heavyweight division,
but he beat up this Russian cat and

2396
01:38:49,291 --> 01:38:52,510
fucked him up and the guy wound up being
in the hospital for quite a long time

2397
01:38:52,511 --> 01:38:54,540
and his,
I believe his career's over at some

2398
01:38:54,541 --> 01:38:56,700
swelling and bleeding,
bleeding on the brain,

2399
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:00,600
but he survived.
But Tim is a unfortunately passed away.

2400
01:39:01,110 --> 01:39:02,640
Scary Shit,
you know,

2401
01:39:02,641 --> 01:39:04,350
so those fights they'd come with,
you know,

2402
01:39:04,351 --> 01:39:07,950
this is a great consequence that we
don't feel as spectators,

2403
01:39:08,260 --> 01:39:10,600
although I think people feel it now more
than ever.

2404
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:12,820
For sure.
Football too.

2405
01:39:12,821 --> 01:39:13,271
I mean,
I,

2406
01:39:13,271 --> 01:39:13,811
that's,
I,

2407
01:39:13,811 --> 01:39:16,090
I can't,
I can't get over like when you hear it,

2408
01:39:16,091 --> 01:39:18,790
like just a crack of a helmet.
There it is.

2409
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:21,990
Um,
why was it brain damage fighter allowed

2410
01:39:21,991 --> 01:39:23,850
to leave Madison Square Garden on his
own?

2411
01:39:23,910 --> 01:39:26,070
Yeah.
What is a homeboy's name there?

2412
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:31,880
Ma?
Magomed Abdu Salam off Maga Abdu Salam

2413
01:39:33,661 --> 01:39:34,950
off.
And uh,

2414
01:39:35,190 --> 01:39:37,080
he was fighting a Mike Perez.

2415
01:39:38,260 --> 01:39:38,970
Okay.

2416
01:39:38,970 --> 01:39:41,280
Think that's the fight.
So I got the guy wrong too.

2417
01:39:41,281 --> 01:39:42,410
That's not the big,
uh,

2418
01:39:42,690 --> 01:39:45,270
Cuban heavyweight.
I think I fucked it up.

2419
01:39:45,271 --> 01:39:47,640
It's a different Cuban heavyweight,
by the way.

2420
01:39:47,641 --> 01:39:49,350
Have you been to the theater at the
garden there?

2421
01:39:49,870 --> 01:39:50,990
See,
it's a great place to watch.

2422
01:39:51,030 --> 01:39:51,960
Oh yeah.
It's amazing.

2423
01:39:51,961 --> 01:39:53,520
I love it.
The theater is amazing.

2424
01:39:53,560 --> 01:39:55,590
Yeah,
I'm doing stand up there.

2425
01:39:56,030 --> 01:39:56,540
Hello.
Hello.

2426
01:39:56,540 --> 01:39:58,320
So I'm excited.
I'm excited.

2427
01:39:59,310 --> 01:40:01,260
There's a big UFC fight at Madison
Square Garden.

2428
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:02,560
What does that guy,
Louis?

2429
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:04,200
No,
Louis Gomez,

2430
01:40:04,201 --> 01:40:06,380
comedian.
There's a,

2431
01:40:06,750 --> 01:40:07,670
there's a,
uh,

2432
01:40:07,710 --> 01:40:11,090
top Cuban heavyweight and something.
Goddammit.

2433
01:40:11,900 --> 01:40:16,260
You want a name overlap and boxing too.
This guy was in a coma after this loss.

2434
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:17,670
Yeah.
It seems like it was saying,

2435
01:40:17,700 --> 01:40:21,180
I think I got the wrong guy though.
Like that was the right fight,

2436
01:40:21,181 --> 01:40:23,670
but I'm trying to figure out who the
other guy is that I thought was this

2437
01:40:23,671 --> 01:40:24,200
guy.

2438
01:40:24,200 --> 01:40:25,033
Yeah.

2439
01:40:26,460 --> 01:40:27,910
I said another guy,
God dammit,

2440
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,100
he's one of the top guys are really big
do's.

2441
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:31,540
Ortiz.
Yes.

2442
01:40:31,570 --> 01:40:32,740
Louis Ortiz.
Thank you.

2443
01:40:33,370 --> 01:40:34,300
I thought I was going crazy.

2444
01:40:35,470 --> 01:40:36,690
Um,
I never remember anything.

2445
01:40:36,691 --> 01:40:38,370
That's why the people I've talked to
people where they're like,

2446
01:40:38,371 --> 01:40:39,930
yeah,
you should do a sports thing.

2447
01:40:39,931 --> 01:40:40,860
And I'm like,
I'm not,

2448
01:40:40,861 --> 01:40:42,510
again,
like I reiterate,

2449
01:40:42,511 --> 01:40:43,980
I'm a fan.
I'm a,

2450
01:40:44,310 --> 01:40:45,180
I'm a,
uh,

2451
01:40:45,181 --> 01:40:47,340
such a fan,
but I just don't have the,

2452
01:40:47,341 --> 01:40:49,890
uh,
the knowledge to pull out of my little

2453
01:40:50,340 --> 01:40:51,420
knowledge.
Satchel,

2454
01:40:51,570 --> 01:40:54,640
if you did,
would you be in doing alternative boxing

2455
01:40:54,641 --> 01:40:56,020
commentary?
Like say,

2456
01:40:56,430 --> 01:40:58,180
say if like,
I feel like this is going to be the

2457
01:40:58,181 --> 01:41:01,000
future of interactive television.
You're not going to have just one

2458
01:41:01,270 --> 01:41:02,910
commentator till you have the,
you want.

2459
01:41:03,030 --> 01:41:05,800
Yeah.
You have to be the one who would be like

2460
01:41:05,801 --> 01:41:07,480
a,
this is fine.

2461
01:41:07,481 --> 01:41:08,261
Everybody.
Oh,

2462
01:41:08,261 --> 01:41:09,080
this,
you know it.

2463
01:41:09,080 --> 01:41:10,000
Uh,
I,

2464
01:41:10,020 --> 01:41:12,190
it'd be the one who'd be like that.
I like,

2465
01:41:12,191 --> 01:41:15,310
I think he's cuter,
but I think the other guy is better.

2466
01:41:15,490 --> 01:41:16,840
So look,
how about this?

2467
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:20,050
How about maybe a guy sitting down with
his girlfriend and she's like,

2468
01:41:20,051 --> 01:41:22,780
I don't want to watch this fight unless
we watched Morgan's commentary and the

2469
01:41:22,781 --> 01:41:23,590
guy's like,
deal,

2470
01:41:23,590 --> 01:41:25,000
deal.
We got it perfect.

2471
01:41:25,210 --> 01:41:27,190
I get to watch the fight.
You get to listen to Morgan.

2472
01:41:27,490 --> 01:41:30,100
Like that'd be,
that's a fucking good idea.

2473
01:41:30,280 --> 01:41:33,730
And that's not a hard setup.
Now I talked a lot about the cut man.

2474
01:41:33,731 --> 01:41:35,830
I love it.
I love a cut man.

2475
01:41:35,831 --> 01:41:38,230
I love a closeup of a,
of a,

2476
01:41:38,231 --> 01:41:41,110
of a wound over the eye of an end swell.
Oh,

2477
01:41:41,410 --> 01:41:43,310
softening down.
It's fascinating.

2478
01:41:43,311 --> 01:41:45,460
There's tissue,
there's something soothing about it.

2479
01:41:46,300 --> 01:41:49,630
Now when you were boxing where you're
sparring there like a couple times a

2480
01:41:49,631 --> 01:41:51,190
little bit with like a friend,
like not,

2481
01:41:51,220 --> 01:41:55,150
but let's just tap each other or just
really as I go with my friend amy and we

2482
01:41:55,151 --> 01:41:55,900
would,
we would,

2483
01:41:55,900 --> 01:41:57,400
you know,
we would work out.

2484
01:41:57,400 --> 01:41:59,260
It was my workout.
I used it as like a workout.

2485
01:41:59,261 --> 01:42:00,710
And then I became buddies with,
uh,

2486
01:42:00,760 --> 01:42:03,430
with Freddie Roach.
And that was like at a time,

2487
01:42:03,431 --> 01:42:05,110
it was,
I was working at Kimmel at the time and

2488
01:42:05,111 --> 01:42:06,670
um,
and uh,

2489
01:42:06,750 --> 01:42:07,510
this is,
uh,

2490
01:42:07,510 --> 01:42:09,370
12 years ago or something like that.
Nah.

2491
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:13,360
And I would just work out and then
occasionally do a little,

2492
01:42:13,361 --> 01:42:15,250
like Freddy would have to a little
sparring,

2493
01:42:15,251 --> 01:42:16,900
but it was very,
you know,

2494
01:42:16,930 --> 01:42:19,990
very,
a couple couple of points here and then

2495
01:42:20,050 --> 01:42:21,160
done.
Like,

2496
01:42:21,161 --> 01:42:22,420
I was very,
I was nervous.

2497
01:42:23,020 --> 01:42:24,520
I was nervous.
I spy when I was a kid.

2498
01:42:24,521 --> 01:42:26,860
I did a lot of karate as I sparred as a
kid.

2499
01:42:26,861 --> 01:42:30,160
I kicked some kid in the head,
like a testing and I remember the,

2500
01:42:30,161 --> 01:42:31,750
uh,
instructor,

2501
01:42:31,751 --> 01:42:32,441
uh,
saying,

2502
01:42:32,441 --> 01:42:33,880
good job to me.
Whoa.

2503
01:42:33,940 --> 01:42:35,440
I just nailed some kid in the head.

2504
01:42:37,450 --> 01:42:38,283
But,
uh,

2505
01:42:38,360 --> 01:42:38,700
the,
no,

2506
01:42:38,700 --> 01:42:40,930
I mean I went to,
the coolest thing about the loud card

2507
01:42:40,931 --> 01:42:43,240
was I feel like I,
uh,

2508
01:42:44,410 --> 01:42:46,690
Pacquiao was,
was training there every day pretty

2509
01:42:46,691 --> 01:42:48,550
much.
And Freddy would let me stay when they

2510
01:42:48,551 --> 01:42:51,550
closed the gym for Pacquiao.
He let me stay and like watch him train,

2511
01:42:51,551 --> 01:42:53,350
which was,
that was awesome.

2512
01:42:53,351 --> 01:42:57,130
Like 12 years ago to do that.
Did you ever see Brian Callen at the

2513
01:42:57,131 --> 01:42:58,210
gym?
Ah,

2514
01:42:58,300 --> 01:42:59,031
yeah.
Uh,

2515
01:42:59,031 --> 01:43:01,990
I feel like I feel if we took,
if I didn't see him there,

2516
01:43:01,991 --> 01:43:05,220
we talked about it,
definitely count boxes at a time.

2517
01:43:05,290 --> 01:43:07,390
He spars,
he's always talking to me about a

2518
01:43:07,391 --> 01:43:10,810
sparring and wait,
two stops barring your brain is already

2519
01:43:10,811 --> 01:43:12,700
soft.
Like what are you doing?

2520
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:13,790
I get excited about,
I,

2521
01:43:13,791 --> 01:43:14,920
I,
I fought a,

2522
01:43:14,921 --> 01:43:15,840
um,
uh,

2523
01:43:15,850 --> 01:43:17,800
it was,
it was more of a bit,

2524
01:43:17,801 --> 01:43:20,020
but uh,
for vice magazine when it was just the

2525
01:43:20,021 --> 01:43:20,980
magazine we did,
uh,

2526
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:23,050
uh,
I fought a heavyweight,

2527
01:43:23,100 --> 01:43:24,130
a female heavyweight.

2528
01:43:24,130 --> 01:43:26,980
We did it in a prom dresses.
Um,

2529
01:43:27,070 --> 01:43:29,050
a very,
she wasn't allowed to.

2530
01:43:29,051 --> 01:43:30,750
Really?
Yeah.

2531
01:43:30,760 --> 01:43:32,920
She like could get her belts taken away.
And stuff.

2532
01:43:33,250 --> 01:43:34,840
But I brought this dude from the,
uh,

2533
01:43:34,900 --> 01:43:36,610
from the wildcard is like my,
uh,

2534
01:43:36,640 --> 01:43:39,610
my corner man and we both wore a prom
dresses.

2535
01:43:39,611 --> 01:43:41,260
So she was a real fighter,
real fighter,

2536
01:43:41,261 --> 01:43:43,240
heavyweight fighter.
And then at one point I think I just

2537
01:43:43,241 --> 01:43:44,980
jumped on her back.
Oh Jesus.

2538
01:43:44,981 --> 01:43:47,680
And tried to like knock her down.
So she didn't try to hit she,

2539
01:43:47,740 --> 01:43:51,320
you know,
the plan was for her to try and I was,

2540
01:43:51,321 --> 01:43:56,321
my plan was for me to allow her to try
and then her a manager was like,

2541
01:43:56,661 --> 01:43:57,740
Nah,
she's not allowed to.

2542
01:43:58,730 --> 01:44:01,450
It's like you legally,
she wasn't allowed to hurt me.

2543
01:44:02,090 --> 01:44:03,410
I know,
but I thought it'd be,

2544
01:44:03,411 --> 01:44:05,480
you know,
good to see you get knocked out.

2545
01:44:05,660 --> 01:44:07,160
Yeah,
that'd be my fun little,

2546
01:44:07,161 --> 01:44:09,360
you know,
he was at,

2547
01:44:09,510 --> 01:44:14,120
don't you want like I get embarrassed
when I haven't done something that

2548
01:44:14,121 --> 01:44:17,360
sounds like I would like to be able to
say I got knocked out once.

2549
01:44:17,860 --> 01:44:19,140
Yeah.
Hmm.

2550
01:44:19,550 --> 01:44:21,110
Don't say that someone would come and
knock you out.

2551
01:44:22,280 --> 01:44:23,660
It's not good for you.
Here you are.

2552
01:44:23,750 --> 01:44:24,583
Oh,
there's me.

2553
01:44:24,920 --> 01:44:26,030
She's picking you up.
Yeah.

2554
01:44:26,270 --> 01:44:27,200
Well she seems friendly.

2555
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:34,600
Heavyweight.
So how come you stop doing it?

2556
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:36,890
Oh,
can we stop boxing?

2557
01:44:37,110 --> 01:44:39,600
Good technique there.
Look how you're a thank you.

2558
01:44:39,601 --> 01:44:43,220
Shut off the back foot.
A Freddie Roach used to call my right,

2559
01:44:43,221 --> 01:44:47,660
the cannon and a real honor to now that
you and Brian you get together narrate

2560
01:44:47,690 --> 01:44:49,720
your own life.
Um,

2561
01:44:49,910 --> 01:44:53,030
I don't is the Canon?
Yeah,

2562
01:44:53,031 --> 01:44:55,010
I think I like,
honestly,

2563
01:44:55,210 --> 01:44:59,060
I got like a little,
I got like depressed and stopped boxing

2564
01:44:59,061 --> 01:45:02,150
and started going to this coffee place
and stuff.

2565
01:45:02,170 --> 01:45:02,871
Like it just,
it's,

2566
01:45:02,871 --> 01:45:03,770
that's,
that shit's boring.

2567
01:45:03,771 --> 01:45:06,200
I got look up the depressed stop going
to the gym.

2568
01:45:06,740 --> 01:45:09,170
So the gym didn't help you with
depression?

2569
01:45:09,200 --> 01:45:13,760
Like no one was like a big dip.
So there's a few months away from that

2570
01:45:13,761 --> 01:45:16,640
kind of stuff and I just stopped going
and then I didn't go back because it was

2571
01:45:16,641 --> 01:45:20,060
so by that time I,
I wanted to,

2572
01:45:20,061 --> 01:45:22,400
but it was also that Jim became,
it was like,

2573
01:45:22,401 --> 01:45:23,930
it's like Jeremy Pins there everyday.

2574
01:45:23,960 --> 01:45:28,960
It just became such a scene that it
became not what I had started going

2575
01:45:30,111 --> 01:45:31,690
there for,
if that makes sense.

2576
01:45:31,691 --> 01:45:32,870
It does.
You know,

2577
01:45:32,871 --> 01:45:35,810
and I,
and I love it and I should absolutely go

2578
01:45:35,811 --> 01:45:37,100
back and,
and,

2579
01:45:37,101 --> 01:45:40,910
and frankly,
I think Freddie Roach been as nice to me

2580
01:45:40,911 --> 01:45:43,790
as he has been in my life.
Is one of the stranger,

2581
01:45:44,360 --> 01:45:45,590
you know,
kind of.

2582
01:45:45,680 --> 01:45:46,513
Oh,
I don't know.

2583
01:45:46,590 --> 01:45:50,270
He had no reason to sort of take me at
any did.

2584
01:45:50,271 --> 01:45:52,430
I almost moved in next door to the
wildcard with Frat.

2585
01:45:52,431 --> 01:45:53,620
Like it was like,
you know,

2586
01:45:53,640 --> 01:45:56,090
he's a dear friend for a long time.
When I got to go back to them,

2587
01:45:56,360 --> 01:45:58,880
we were going to live,
I was going to live next to the gym

2588
01:45:58,881 --> 01:46:01,370
almost for a second and the apartment
attached to the gym.

2589
01:46:01,371 --> 01:46:04,670
But um,
I was just in the middle of that would

2590
01:46:04,671 --> 01:46:07,370
be a crush shit at bells going off to
me.

2591
01:46:07,380 --> 01:46:07,741
Me,
me,

2592
01:46:07,741 --> 01:46:09,070
me.
Yeah.

2593
01:46:09,180 --> 01:46:11,270
But he's great.
He took me to like boxing writers,

2594
01:46:11,330 --> 01:46:12,650
awards,
dinners and stuff.

2595
01:46:12,651 --> 01:46:14,320
I got to meet a lot of like great pete.
Me.

2596
01:46:14,340 --> 01:46:14,961
It was,
it was,

2597
01:46:14,961 --> 01:46:17,960
it was a cool time of my life,
but I just sort of,

2598
01:46:18,410 --> 01:46:20,030
you know,
and then I moved to New York and I think

2599
01:46:20,031 --> 01:46:23,390
that was a big part of it too is did you
find out if Coleville of ward,

2600
01:46:23,391 --> 01:46:28,110
if they had a standing eight count,
I found someone trying to describe it

2601
01:46:28,120 --> 01:46:30,650
analysis and facts and said that it was
a unified rules.

2602
01:46:30,690 --> 01:46:35,690
No standing account was in that.
Oh well if a guy quits and there's no

2603
01:46:35,751 --> 01:46:38,060
standing eight count,
you've got to think of it as a knockout.

2604
01:46:38,061 --> 01:46:40,800
It's like mma.
But if there's a standing eight count

2605
01:46:40,801 --> 01:46:43,700
that would have given it to them there
or what he should've done is probably

2606
01:46:43,701 --> 01:46:47,540
take a knee Kovalev probably should have
taken a knee and if you took a knee then

2607
01:46:47,541 --> 01:46:49,980
he would get a 10 count that that'll be
considered

2608
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:52,730
a knockdown low blows.
Big Low blows.

2609
01:46:52,740 --> 01:46:53,573
Yeah,
he definitely,

2610
01:46:54,010 --> 01:46:55,350
yeah,
you definitely got hit low.

2611
01:46:56,010 --> 01:46:58,700
And then there was a couple of them that
are questionable like on the beltline

2612
01:46:58,740 --> 01:47:01,050
apparently they were saying Kovalev was
belt was pretty high.

2613
01:47:01,670 --> 01:47:02,503
It's,
it's,

2614
01:47:02,600 --> 01:47:07,600
it's funny cause there tends to somehow
unboxing something happens be it,

2615
01:47:07,911 --> 01:47:08,960
uh,
you know,

2616
01:47:09,050 --> 01:47:12,320
horrific judgment,
which I think happens a lot.

2617
01:47:12,321 --> 01:47:17,321
Like to allow there to be another fight.
Like it just seems to be like something

2618
01:47:19,400 --> 01:47:22,790
always fucking hell.
That's why when I have a lot of people

2619
01:47:22,791 --> 01:47:27,791
over to watch boxing and like I hate,
I hate the parts of the sport that

2620
01:47:28,911 --> 01:47:33,911
seemed like it's fixed because I can
appreciate the fight as a whole.

2621
01:47:33,951 --> 01:47:36,500
Even without an outcome I think is
fixed.

2622
01:47:36,660 --> 01:47:36,891
No,
no,

2623
01:47:36,891 --> 01:47:38,360
not this,
but I just seen inboxing.

2624
01:47:38,480 --> 01:47:43,480
There always seems to be something
something happens that would make a

2625
01:47:43,491 --> 01:47:45,380
rematch more attractive.
Right.

2626
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:49,460
But that's just the nature of
competition on a big scale like that

2627
01:47:49,461 --> 01:47:54,050
with crazy consequences like the um,
the Klitschko Anthony Joshua fight.

2628
01:47:54,430 --> 01:47:57,470
Like that's the consequences of f I just
fucking chaos.

2629
01:47:57,500 --> 01:48:01,010
Just guys getting knocked down,
get back up and knocking the other guy

2630
01:48:01,011 --> 01:48:03,680
down or holy shit.
Then a kind of a controversial ending.

2631
01:48:03,681 --> 01:48:04,720
They stop it.
Oh,

2632
01:48:04,750 --> 01:48:06,860
it looked like he was defending himself.
What do you think there's more

2633
01:48:06,861 --> 01:48:09,560
controversial endings and boxing than
there are in a mma?

2634
01:48:09,620 --> 01:48:13,820
I think people make split second
decisions on the referees in the heat of

2635
01:48:13,821 --> 01:48:15,590
the moment and when you're going to have
that,

2636
01:48:15,591 --> 01:48:17,960
you're going to have mistakes.
It happens all the time and it's,

2637
01:48:17,980 --> 01:48:19,820
it has nothing to do with like there's a
lot of,

2638
01:48:19,890 --> 01:48:22,370
a lot of mistakes.
I do not think it's fixed.

2639
01:48:22,440 --> 01:48:25,910
Not by any stretch of the imagination.
I think especially like with respected

2640
01:48:25,911 --> 01:48:28,400
fighters,
I think people do have biases for

2641
01:48:28,401 --> 01:48:31,940
certain styles and there's certain,
there's certain referees that we'll let

2642
01:48:31,941 --> 01:48:35,210
a fire defend himself further than some
will.

2643
01:48:35,211 --> 01:48:36,530
Some will,
especially in mma,

2644
01:48:37,960 --> 01:48:38,750
you know,
judges are,

2645
01:48:38,750 --> 01:48:40,670
he's sitting in a similar,
we're not,

2646
01:48:40,671 --> 01:48:43,160
but I always,
I always find it hard to explain to

2647
01:48:43,161 --> 01:48:45,620
friends who come over who never watched
that stuff.

2648
01:48:45,621 --> 01:48:47,900
And I'm like,
I love having people over and having

2649
01:48:47,901 --> 01:48:48,681
like it.
Like I said,

2650
01:48:48,681 --> 01:48:51,140
the social aspect of like sports to me
is really fun.

2651
01:48:51,410 --> 01:48:54,680
But when friends come over and they
constantly see results that they don't

2652
01:48:54,681 --> 01:48:57,290
understand,
they're done with the sport,

2653
01:48:57,320 --> 01:48:59,120
you know?
Whereas if you like it more or you can

2654
01:48:59,121 --> 01:48:59,841
be like,
ah,

2655
01:48:59,841 --> 01:49:01,540
it's a,
is that it happens.

2656
01:49:01,660 --> 01:49:04,390
Problem is you're a people pleaser and
trying to get these people to like

2657
01:49:04,391 --> 01:49:05,590
something that you like.
Yeah.

2658
01:49:05,620 --> 01:49:07,540
You should just let them go.
Let them think it's fixed.

2659
01:49:07,630 --> 01:49:10,480
I'm not so many conversations with guys
like mmas fixed man,

2660
01:49:10,481 --> 01:49:12,760
just admitted for that.
Oh I don't want to talk to you.

2661
01:49:13,090 --> 01:49:15,250
[inaudible] this is a silly way of
approaching this issue.

2662
01:49:15,251 --> 01:49:16,880
You don't know anything.
Yeah.

2663
01:49:16,920 --> 01:49:19,600
And you're trying to pretend like,
you know something so that we're right

2664
01:49:19,601 --> 01:49:21,190
from the beginning.
We're fucked like this.

2665
01:49:21,191 --> 01:49:24,340
We can't have this conversation.
You're pretending that you've seen

2666
01:49:24,341 --> 01:49:25,780
enough eyes,
you understand fighting enough.

2667
01:49:25,781 --> 01:49:27,520
You've competed in a,
if you've been hit enough,

2668
01:49:27,521 --> 01:49:29,960
you've seen people get hit.
You know enough to know when something

2669
01:49:29,961 --> 01:49:32,020
that's real and something's not,
you know,

2670
01:49:32,080 --> 01:49:33,610
you know,
everybody else can't figure it out.

2671
01:49:33,611 --> 01:49:35,650
But you figured out that a lot of the
fights are fixed.

2672
01:49:36,100 --> 01:49:37,150
There's some fixed fights.

2673
01:49:37,460 --> 01:49:38,480
That's why like,
I mean,

2674
01:49:38,481 --> 01:49:39,051
I,
I right.

2675
01:49:39,051 --> 01:49:41,870
I mean obviously like last five years
I've been obsessed with the Golovkin

2676
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:44,240
cause yeah.
He's just a knockout artist and you

2677
01:49:44,241 --> 01:49:45,200
can't,
you know,

2678
01:49:45,740 --> 01:49:47,830
that's not it.
There's proof to it.

2679
01:49:47,831 --> 01:49:48,910
I mean,
maybe with MMA too,

2680
01:49:48,911 --> 01:49:53,911
it's like you can,
I would say that early stoppages and

2681
01:49:54,430 --> 01:49:55,600
boxing and probably more,

2682
01:49:56,810 --> 01:49:57,920
no,
they're very common.

2683
01:49:57,950 --> 01:50:00,800
Or are they calling in both sports?
It's just people making mistakes.

2684
01:50:01,070 --> 01:50:03,470
But my point is there are going to be
fixed fights.

2685
01:50:03,500 --> 01:50:07,940
[inaudible] just going to be people that
do things just like there's referees and

2686
01:50:07,941 --> 01:50:11,960
NBA apparently they get busted trying to
stretch games out and trying to call

2687
01:50:11,961 --> 01:50:15,920
fouls on certain teams and they work for
people that bet money and they try to

2688
01:50:15,921 --> 01:50:17,840
shave points.
That shit's always gonna exist.

2689
01:50:18,140 --> 01:50:20,480
There's always going to be someone who
tries to talk to a referee and says,

2690
01:50:20,481 --> 01:50:21,500
listen buddy,
it's,

2691
01:50:21,710 --> 01:50:24,260
I'm not saying that you should fix the
fight.

2692
01:50:24,440 --> 01:50:27,020
I'm saying if you see somebody get hurt,
stop that motherfucker.

2693
01:50:27,050 --> 01:50:29,290
Stop that fight,
pull that trigger a little quick and I

2694
01:50:29,291 --> 01:50:32,000
was going to be mad at you.
And there's that,

2695
01:50:32,180 --> 01:50:33,620
you know,
there's definitely that.

2696
01:50:33,830 --> 01:50:36,140
But how often does it happen?
I bet it happens.

2697
01:50:36,140 --> 01:50:38,870
Pretty rarely.
I bet it's much more people making

2698
01:50:38,871 --> 01:50:40,640
mistakes,
much more people in the heat of the

2699
01:50:40,641 --> 01:50:43,430
moment.
Much more just the nature of the chaos

2700
01:50:43,431 --> 01:50:48,140
of combat sport competition.
Just wacky shit happens and people make

2701
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:51,170
big mistakes as referees.
Just like,

2702
01:50:51,320 --> 01:50:53,420
you know,
people like you and I make big mistakes

2703
01:50:53,421 --> 01:50:55,760
talking on a podcast.
You just talking off the top of your

2704
01:50:55,761 --> 01:50:56,211
head,
right?

2705
01:50:56,211 --> 01:50:58,310
Sure.
Make mistakes then.

2706
01:50:58,460 --> 01:51:00,920
But with a referee,
you're making a mistake like this other

2707
01:51:00,921 --> 01:51:04,490
guy's career.
Like for Kovalev to not recognize the

2708
01:51:04,491 --> 01:51:06,470
low blows,
to stop the fight,

2709
01:51:06,740 --> 01:51:09,470
like the way he did Kovalev fucked up.
You should have taken a neat,

2710
01:51:09,680 --> 01:51:09,890
yeah.

2711
01:51:09,890 --> 01:51:10,491
Yeah.
I mean,

2712
01:51:10,491 --> 01:51:12,620
but that's the thing is that I,
a lot of these,

2713
01:51:12,710 --> 01:51:15,950
a lot of these things can lead to
another fight like that.

2714
01:51:15,951 --> 01:51:19,070
So saying it says that without the
controversy there's less attraction.

2715
01:51:19,280 --> 01:51:19,850
Yeah,

2716
01:51:19,850 --> 01:51:21,110
no one's going to agree to it.
Look,

2717
01:51:21,111 --> 01:51:25,010
Andre Ward is not going to agree to some
sort of a predetermined outcome is not

2718
01:51:25,011 --> 01:51:26,330
going to agree to a predetermined
outcome.

2719
01:51:26,570 --> 01:51:29,180
So those two principles,
the most important parts of this

2720
01:51:29,181 --> 01:51:31,760
equation would never fucking ever agree
to.

2721
01:51:31,761 --> 01:51:33,920
Let the other person,
when there's not a chance in hell

2722
01:51:33,921 --> 01:51:35,880
Kovalev is just going down from
[inaudible].

2723
01:51:36,330 --> 01:51:36,921
Oh No,
I don't.

2724
01:51:36,921 --> 01:51:38,570
I don't know.
I just think that,

2725
01:51:38,970 --> 01:51:39,271
no,
no,

2726
01:51:39,271 --> 01:51:42,720
I don't think it's fixed.
I just think the controversy itself

2727
01:51:43,200 --> 01:51:45,960
makes a rematch more attractive to our
shores.

2728
01:51:45,990 --> 01:51:48,620
But the idea that somehow because it's
finished,

2729
01:51:48,621 --> 01:51:49,150
I don't,
yeah,

2730
01:51:49,150 --> 01:51:50,370
yeah.
But a lot of people do.

2731
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:50,760
Yeah.
Dude.

2732
01:51:50,760 --> 01:51:52,920
Boxing that guy at the party.
Everybody.

2733
01:51:53,540 --> 01:51:54,810
Everybody at my house,
like ever.

2734
01:51:54,930 --> 01:51:57,300
I also seem to invite people over for
the wrong fights.

2735
01:51:57,301 --> 01:51:58,110
You know what I mean?
Where you're like,

2736
01:51:58,110 --> 01:51:59,550
oh,
the last one was fucking great,

2737
01:51:59,551 --> 01:52:01,230
and then you've,
and then you have people over and it's

2738
01:52:01,231 --> 01:52:02,064
like,
eh.

2739
01:52:02,280 --> 01:52:03,360
Yeah,
exactly.

2740
01:52:04,030 --> 01:52:06,670
That's always how it is.
There's so many people that just,

2741
01:52:06,700 --> 01:52:10,540
they just don't,
they've never competed and so like they

2742
01:52:10,541 --> 01:52:12,220
just,
and there's also people that want to

2743
01:52:12,221 --> 01:52:14,240
call bullshit.
They want to be the first person to call

2744
01:52:14,250 --> 01:52:15,700
bullshit.
So they like,

2745
01:52:15,800 --> 01:52:19,120
they're a little itchy on the trigger
calling bullshit on things.

2746
01:52:19,510 --> 01:52:20,470
He's always given me that.
Right?

2747
01:52:21,730 --> 01:52:24,220
Contrarians,
lot of contrarians,

2748
01:52:24,221 --> 01:52:26,120
none of them.
A lot of smart people are contrary.

2749
01:52:26,520 --> 01:52:29,050
Some of my smartest friends,
just disappointing.

2750
01:52:29,051 --> 01:52:32,020
Sometimes some of my smartest friends
were always wrong.

2751
01:52:34,190 --> 01:52:35,930
Well,
it's like what led them to be smart and

2752
01:52:35,931 --> 01:52:37,910
curious.
It's like this distrust of things,

2753
01:52:39,380 --> 01:52:41,150
but contrarians also fun,
right?

2754
01:52:41,190 --> 01:52:44,360
You see the tide going one way,
like fuck that Thai sparring,

2755
01:52:44,950 --> 01:52:46,370
sparring,
verbal sparring,

2756
01:52:46,910 --> 01:52:49,790
keep it flowing a little.
Uh,

2757
01:52:50,690 --> 01:52:51,441
yeah,
that's a big,

2758
01:52:51,441 --> 01:52:52,340
same with comics,
right?

2759
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:54,740
I always,
I find that the,

2760
01:52:54,741 --> 01:52:57,500
uh,
the guys I tend to be attracted to a or

2761
01:52:57,501 --> 01:52:59,330
a attracted to our,
uh,

2762
01:53:00,210 --> 01:53:02,440
our,
our contrarians are just,

2763
01:53:02,470 --> 01:53:03,201
are just,
it's,

2764
01:53:03,201 --> 01:53:04,430
it's,
it's a fight from,

2765
01:53:04,580 --> 01:53:05,930
you know,
from the get go.

2766
01:53:06,290 --> 01:53:08,000
Really.
That's what you like a little bit.

2767
01:53:08,060 --> 01:53:10,650
He's like a little bit for a little bit
of a verbal sparring.

2768
01:53:10,651 --> 01:53:11,780
Yeah.
Let's see if they can hang.

2769
01:53:12,590 --> 01:53:13,550
Yeah.
And I,

2770
01:53:13,551 --> 01:53:14,271
you know,
I,

2771
01:53:14,271 --> 01:53:15,890
it's,
you know,

2772
01:53:15,891 --> 01:53:16,701
I'm,
I'm my,

2773
01:53:16,701 --> 01:53:17,440
uh,
I'm,

2774
01:53:17,440 --> 01:53:20,370
I'm totally driven entirely by being
like s,

2775
01:53:20,550 --> 01:53:22,190
you know,
mentally stimulated.

2776
01:53:22,191 --> 01:53:23,840
So it's just then,
then I'm,

2777
01:53:23,841 --> 01:53:26,990
then I'm in like sexually,
but if it's not fun,

2778
01:53:27,560 --> 01:53:29,060
the Banter's not fun,
then I'm,

2779
01:53:29,300 --> 01:53:31,640
then I would have no interest in fucking
someone.

2780
01:53:32,140 --> 01:53:34,850
I hear you.
That's not how I feel at all.

2781
01:53:35,030 --> 01:53:37,190
That's a,
that's a difference between guys and

2782
01:53:37,191 --> 01:53:39,560
girls.
It is very much session comics.

2783
01:53:39,690 --> 01:53:41,650
I've heard that many times like girl
comics,

2784
01:53:41,651 --> 01:53:43,310
or they would never date a girl that
wasn't funny.

2785
01:53:43,610 --> 01:53:45,540
And you never hear that from a dude.
No,

2786
01:53:45,630 --> 01:53:46,221
no.
That's,

2787
01:53:46,221 --> 01:53:47,180
that is,
that is,

2788
01:53:47,181 --> 01:53:48,070
uh,
it's,

2789
01:53:48,071 --> 01:53:49,850
it's funny that's,
it's,

2790
01:53:49,851 --> 01:53:53,330
it's one of the things I talk about the
most with a lot of my female comedian

2791
01:53:53,331 --> 01:53:54,164
friends,
but it's just,

2792
01:53:54,440 --> 01:53:56,660
there's not,
there's no part of me that would be

2793
01:53:56,661 --> 01:53:59,050
sexually interested in somebody who
wasn't a,

2794
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:01,190
if not funny.
I mean,

2795
01:54:01,400 --> 01:54:05,480
if not funny,
they'd have to be brutally a smart on,

2796
01:54:05,481 --> 01:54:06,020
uh,
you know,

2797
01:54:06,020 --> 01:54:09,860
on a level that I don't even understand
what night Stephen hawkings shit.

2798
01:54:09,890 --> 01:54:11,240
Yeah.
Like I'd have to just,

2799
01:54:11,241 --> 01:54:12,350
Eh,
I don't,

2800
01:54:12,410 --> 01:54:13,940
I don't know.
I like to,

2801
01:54:14,780 --> 01:54:16,940
this is,
this is going to sound wrong,

2802
01:54:16,970 --> 01:54:17,960
but,
uh,

2803
01:54:19,160 --> 01:54:21,440
there's something fun and attractive
about,

2804
01:54:21,470 --> 01:54:22,580
you know,
uh,

2805
01:54:22,670 --> 01:54:24,650
intellectually being put in your place.

2806
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:25,940
Wow.
That's weird.

2807
01:54:26,170 --> 01:54:27,830
Like you would like to be intellectually
choked.

2808
01:54:28,340 --> 01:54:30,380
Yeah.
Yeah.

2809
01:54:30,381 --> 01:54:32,390
A little bit.
A little bit.

2810
01:54:32,391 --> 01:54:33,021
I don't,
I,

2811
01:54:33,021 --> 01:54:33,920
you know,
I don't,

2812
01:54:33,921 --> 01:54:34,760
uh,
I don't,

2813
01:54:34,890 --> 01:54:36,650
I,
I don't know,

2814
01:54:36,651 --> 01:54:39,680
maybe it's not the popular opinion,
but because a fuck,

2815
01:54:40,340 --> 01:54:43,340
it's your opinion.
It doesn't have to be popular if you

2816
01:54:43,341 --> 01:54:46,070
enjoy it.
It's also like if somebody is,

2817
01:54:47,150 --> 01:54:50,870
it doesn't have to be my thing.
Even if someone's great at their thing.

2818
01:54:51,420 --> 01:54:53,690
Right.
And I have no understanding of it,

2819
01:54:53,691 --> 01:54:56,360
I find that to be a track like it.
So it doesn't necessarily always have to

2820
01:54:56,361 --> 01:54:58,970
be a comedian and someone who is,
you know,

2821
01:54:59,030 --> 01:55:02,570
brilliantly hilarious.
Like I've been attracted to guys who are

2822
01:55:02,571 --> 01:55:07,571
just brilliant at a thing that I have
zero comprehension I how you even get

2823
01:55:07,701 --> 01:55:10,880
good at it,
let along graded it and something fun

2824
01:55:10,881 --> 01:55:12,230
about it.
Yeah.

2825
01:55:12,231 --> 01:55:14,090
I'm always fascinated by those people
for sure.

2826
01:55:14,091 --> 01:55:17,610
But I don't find them attractive.
No.

2827
01:55:18,470 --> 01:55:20,060
Like a fur.
I will believe me.

2828
01:55:20,061 --> 01:55:22,310
There are things I wish I wish I was
more attracted to.

2829
01:55:22,311 --> 01:55:25,310
Like I wish I could just,
I wish I was attracted to,

2830
01:55:25,400 --> 01:55:28,340
to,
to money and looks and all the things

2831
01:55:28,341 --> 01:55:29,120
that,
you know.

2832
01:55:29,120 --> 01:55:30,770
Yeah.
I wish I really though this is the same

2833
01:55:30,780 --> 01:55:32,600
on original.
Um,

2834
01:55:33,260 --> 01:55:38,260
it seems like there'd be more options
and then it would be easier as opposed

2835
01:55:39,111 --> 01:55:43,140
to waiting three years to find someone
who just like hits the right button and

2836
01:55:43,141 --> 01:55:43,930
you're like,
oh God.

2837
01:55:43,930 --> 01:55:44,450
Amen.

2838
01:55:44,450 --> 01:55:44,971
Yeah,
yeah,

2839
01:55:44,971 --> 01:55:47,070
yeah.
Wow.

2840
01:55:49,050 --> 01:55:53,430
Be like tuned into someone in a mental
way.

2841
01:55:53,490 --> 01:55:58,320
Like your minds are tuned into each
other where you can speak on the same

2842
01:55:58,740 --> 01:56:02,400
terms where you can,
you can both recognize the humor in

2843
01:56:02,401 --> 01:56:05,310
things.
You both have opinions on things you,

2844
01:56:05,370 --> 01:56:09,270
you both enhance the conversations that
you have.

2845
01:56:09,271 --> 01:56:11,790
Like you throw in something that makes
me laugh and I throw in something makes

2846
01:56:11,791 --> 01:56:13,920
you laugh and then boom.
It's always so much more fun.

2847
01:56:14,460 --> 01:56:15,600
It just is.
It's just,

2848
01:56:15,750 --> 01:56:18,300
that's how it is with friends.
That's how it is with everybody.

2849
01:56:18,301 --> 01:56:20,070
That'd be,
that's like what I said about bar,

2850
01:56:20,190 --> 01:56:24,360
like having that podcasts with bear like
me just wouldn't mean burr alone and

2851
01:56:24,361 --> 01:56:27,390
we're talking shit or text messages we
have back and forth to each other.

2852
01:56:27,720 --> 01:56:29,610
They're hilarious.
It's like that.

2853
01:56:29,790 --> 01:56:31,980
Like to have a friend like that as a
cherished thing,

2854
01:56:32,290 --> 01:56:35,730
like to have someone that you could sit
and then if you could fuck them to oh

2855
01:56:35,731 --> 01:56:36,564
shit.

2856
01:56:38,080 --> 01:56:38,980
Yeah,
that'd be fun.

2857
01:56:39,050 --> 01:56:40,570
All right.
Very rarely happens.

2858
01:56:40,600 --> 01:56:45,010
Christina Palicki in Thompson Jura is
one of the rare ones were one of the

2859
01:56:45,011 --> 01:56:49,690
rare too,
too funny comedians that get together

2860
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:51,460
and they both have a great time
together.

2861
01:56:51,580 --> 01:56:53,710
Bonnie Mcfarlane and rich vos and other
one.

2862
01:56:53,950 --> 01:56:58,180
Those are two running the contenders for
the throne.

2863
01:56:58,780 --> 01:57:00,490
Those are the two contenders for the
throne though.

2864
01:57:00,491 --> 01:57:04,570
As far as like funny is married Kabul a
hundred percent I don't see anybody else

2865
01:57:05,020 --> 01:57:09,850
that's like at that level,
Bonnie and rich and Tom and Christina.

2866
01:57:09,851 --> 01:57:13,000
I don't see anybody else at that level.
I'm trying to think.

2867
01:57:13,570 --> 01:57:15,010
It's rare,
but they're outliers.

2868
01:57:15,400 --> 01:57:17,600
Think about it and it Francella Gero Oh,
that's how she,

2869
01:57:17,690 --> 01:57:19,990
I'm sorry.
Stop.

2870
01:57:20,240 --> 01:57:22,630
Moshe and I fucked up Natasha.
Sorry.

2871
01:57:22,631 --> 01:57:23,710
There's,
they're both hilarious.

2872
01:57:23,711 --> 01:57:24,790
You're right.
I fucked up.

2873
01:57:25,360 --> 01:57:28,150
That's number three.
How do I not remember them?

2874
01:57:28,240 --> 01:57:32,020
If that's dust number three,
those those three people other than that

2875
01:57:32,980 --> 01:57:34,270
who I don't know.

2876
01:57:34,700 --> 01:57:35,261
I got,
I got,

2877
01:57:35,261 --> 01:57:37,270
I mean that's three out of 300 million
there.

2878
01:57:37,271 --> 01:57:41,320
One out of 100 million.
Most of this smart funny guys I know

2879
01:57:41,380 --> 01:57:44,260
don't need that in a,
in a woman and,

2880
01:57:44,261 --> 01:57:45,100
and that's,
you know,

2881
01:57:45,101 --> 01:57:48,520
it's not my place to judge.
Like I wish there's part of me that

2882
01:57:48,521 --> 01:57:50,200
like,
I was like Ah,

2883
01:57:50,201 --> 01:57:51,280
you know,
how could you date her?

2884
01:57:51,281 --> 01:57:55,090
She's a fucking idiot or whatever it is.
It's not my job to judge who,

2885
01:57:55,140 --> 01:57:56,710
who uh,
stimulates you.

2886
01:57:56,711 --> 01:57:58,780
But you know it's,
it's,

2887
01:57:59,110 --> 01:58:03,790
it would be easier if I had more options
I think.

2888
01:58:03,910 --> 01:58:08,270
Do you think it would be cheesy if
motion Tasha went on t and went on stage

2889
01:58:08,540 --> 01:58:12,680
with tee shirts that say one out of 100
million

2890
01:58:14,490 --> 01:58:17,570
cause that maybe that could be like
their tour name cause they really are

2891
01:58:17,571 --> 01:58:21,260
like if they're a really legitimately
hilarious couple,

2892
01:58:21,261 --> 01:58:26,060
they're both hilarious.
That's maybe one out of 100 million is

2893
01:58:26,061 --> 01:58:27,410
that,
that's pretty legit,

2894
01:58:27,411 --> 01:58:28,244
right?

2895
01:58:29,030 --> 01:58:30,800
I mean,
I'm trying to,

2896
01:58:30,920 --> 01:58:35,810
maybe there's somebody else and I forgot
you comedians when I was like 21 and I

2897
01:58:35,811 --> 01:58:36,291
was like,
oh,

2898
01:58:36,291 --> 01:58:40,190
they're crazy too.
Can't have this kind of crazy people

2899
01:58:40,191 --> 01:58:43,120
feeding off each other.
That just doesn't seem like a wise move.

2900
01:58:44,940 --> 01:58:47,440
Oh.
And also it's too complicated.

2901
01:58:47,441 --> 01:58:50,890
I've seen what happens when guys data
comic and then they break up with each

2902
01:58:50,891 --> 01:58:54,040
other and then she comes around with
some new dude and the guys all bombed

2903
01:58:54,041 --> 01:58:57,370
out and like that happened with Ari and
Natasha.

2904
01:58:57,740 --> 01:58:58,630
Oh yeah,
I know.

2905
01:58:58,660 --> 01:59:00,550
Yeah,
it's disastrous.

2906
01:59:00,590 --> 01:59:01,190
I was like,
Hey,

2907
01:59:01,190 --> 01:59:02,320
yeah,
don't do that.

2908
01:59:02,500 --> 01:59:03,970
No,
no.

2909
01:59:04,570 --> 01:59:06,580
Just be friends.
Unless,

2910
01:59:07,280 --> 01:59:11,000
unless you gotta do what you gotta do,
you know it could work at,

2911
01:59:11,001 --> 01:59:12,760
the problem is,
is that you're in the same scene to

2912
01:59:12,761 --> 01:59:13,201
someone.
See,

2913
01:59:13,201 --> 01:59:18,100
you got to work through all of your shit
around the person that hurt you and

2914
01:59:18,101 --> 01:59:19,150
that's,
you know,

2915
01:59:19,210 --> 01:59:21,280
that's the hardest.
But you might come out of it.

2916
01:59:21,281 --> 01:59:24,850
A better person might come out of it.
More Open minded,

2917
01:59:24,880 --> 01:59:27,970
more easy going more forgiving.
Just deal.

2918
01:59:28,480 --> 01:59:30,890
Just overcome positive.
I try to be,

2919
01:59:30,970 --> 01:59:33,220
I tried to be marketing.
I do my best.

2920
01:59:34,180 --> 01:59:36,580
I don't always succeed,
but I do my best.

2921
01:59:37,750 --> 01:59:38,790
But again,
it'll,

2922
01:59:38,830 --> 01:59:40,330
you know,
it'll work out.

2923
01:59:41,380 --> 01:59:43,780
It's all gonna work out except for this
fucking yellow stone.

2924
01:59:43,781 --> 01:59:46,840
Think God dammit or done.
So a lot of earthquakes.

2925
01:59:49,260 --> 01:59:51,150
Do you know,
I'd like a guy who does that,

2926
01:59:51,190 --> 01:59:54,690
like measures earthquakes.
Seismologists but like,

2927
01:59:54,750 --> 01:59:56,130
no,
it was more about like,

2928
01:59:56,131 --> 01:59:57,780
uh,
like a,

2929
01:59:57,830 --> 02:00:01,380
a real cynical seismology who's like,
we're done.

2930
02:00:01,490 --> 02:00:04,380
Because what if you really liked guy?
But then you found out he was into jazz.

2931
02:00:05,970 --> 02:00:07,290
Um,
it's happened.

2932
02:00:08,700 --> 02:00:09,840
It's happened over.
Be Like,

2933
02:00:09,870 --> 02:00:12,360
oh no.
And you come home to your apartment De

2934
02:00:12,360 --> 02:00:12,540
de,
De,

2935
02:00:12,540 --> 02:00:15,210
De,
De,

2936
02:00:15,210 --> 02:00:15,210
De,
De,

2937
02:00:15,210 --> 02:00:15,210
de,
De,

2938
02:00:15,210 --> 02:00:16,480
de.
[inaudible].

2939
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:19,080
Every time he called me,
there was jazz on in the background.

2940
02:00:19,740 --> 02:00:21,120
Every time.
No,

2941
02:00:26,240 --> 02:00:27,690
but he was a,
you know,

2942
02:00:27,720 --> 02:00:31,550
very serious actor
wanted,

2943
02:00:32,440 --> 02:00:34,780
he just wanted it on in the background
and put it on in the background.

2944
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:36,680
Right before you called.
So I called someone,

2945
02:00:36,681 --> 02:00:40,860
someone's calling me,
let me see more sophisticated.

2946
02:00:40,890 --> 02:00:43,950
Brian callen used to leave books out on
his table that he wasn't really reading.

2947
02:00:44,940 --> 02:00:47,490
I called him out on it.
I came over to his house one time and he

2948
02:00:47,491 --> 02:00:49,230
had the catcher in the rye or something
like that,

2949
02:00:49,650 --> 02:00:51,060
sitting right on his coffee table.
I'm like,

2950
02:00:51,061 --> 02:00:52,160
bitch,
you are not reading that.

2951
02:00:52,170 --> 02:00:52,981
He started laughing.
He goes,

2952
02:00:52,981 --> 02:00:56,040
I'm not like,
what the fuck do you have that here for

2953
02:00:56,041 --> 02:00:57,370
man?
He goes to impress girls like,

2954
02:00:57,390 --> 02:00:58,223
well,
I knew it.

2955
02:00:58,620 --> 02:00:59,371
I knew it.
It just,

2956
02:00:59,371 --> 02:01:02,910
it's so obvious to impress girls who
don't ask any questions.

2957
02:01:03,060 --> 02:01:04,100
Yeah,
thank you.

2958
02:01:04,910 --> 02:01:08,010
Know like he'd ever have to defend it or
get into it or it go at,

2959
02:01:08,020 --> 02:01:10,440
what's your opinion of it?
Why would you say to grow?

2960
02:01:10,441 --> 02:01:13,650
Ask questions.
That's just Jesus Christ.

2961
02:01:13,651 --> 02:01:15,450
It seems like a disaster waiting to
happen.

2962
02:01:15,900 --> 02:01:18,330
If you date a girl and right away they
come with the questions.

2963
02:01:18,360 --> 02:01:20,360
So what books have you read recently and
like,

2964
02:01:20,370 --> 02:01:21,900
oh,
Jesus was not going to work.

2965
02:01:23,720 --> 02:01:24,553
Aye.

2966
02:01:28,390 --> 02:01:29,560
Morgan Murphy.
Yeah,

2967
02:01:29,800 --> 02:01:32,030
we just hit a wall.
Stop talking.

2968
02:01:32,410 --> 02:01:34,750
What do we do now?
It's just kind of rebuild momentum.

2969
02:01:35,020 --> 02:01:36,810
Talk about it.
And I wish I was like a,

2970
02:01:36,811 --> 02:01:39,130
you know,
a big exciting lady.

2971
02:01:39,250 --> 02:01:40,050
You know?
That's

2972
02:01:40,050 --> 02:01:43,490
a lot of,
with a lot of movement.

2973
02:01:43,770 --> 02:01:47,070
I think one of the best things you've
ever done is that Carlos see a thing

2974
02:01:47,100 --> 02:01:48,610
where he did his material.
Yeah.

2975
02:01:49,170 --> 02:01:51,340
You said that you did it in 1920 would
you say 19

2976
02:01:51,460 --> 02:01:55,480
like 1912 I've tried to make it obvious
that I was fucking with people,

2977
02:01:55,481 --> 02:01:58,110
but it's not every like a,
you know,

2978
02:01:58,180 --> 02:02:00,960
every few months I check,
I see what's going on over there and

2979
02:02:00,970 --> 02:02:03,390
every comment is like,
oh,

2980
02:02:03,400 --> 02:02:07,060
I don't care.
He does a better like it was fucking

2981
02:02:07,061 --> 02:02:07,390
with you.

2982
02:02:07,390 --> 02:02:08,260
Yeah.
You dummy.

2983
02:02:08,261 --> 02:02:12,610
It says 1912 what the fuck?
It's pretty obvious to the way you're

2984
02:02:12,611 --> 02:02:15,760
doing it that it's a parody that was
reading off a cue card.

2985
02:02:15,761 --> 02:02:18,010
I made him five minutes.
I think there are certain people that

2986
02:02:18,011 --> 02:02:20,020
are doomed.
They're just doomed.

2987
02:02:20,021 --> 02:02:21,940
You're never going to get to him.
You know?

2988
02:02:22,240 --> 02:02:25,930
It's like there's certain,
there's certain fish that can breathe

2989
02:02:26,260 --> 02:02:28,480
with their gills and they also can
breathe air.

2990
02:02:28,900 --> 02:02:31,090
They can suck air.
Yeah.

2991
02:02:32,050 --> 02:02:34,690
Not everybody has that ability.
Not Everybody has the ability to

2992
02:02:34,691 --> 02:02:39,691
recognize humor or satire or just to see
it in certain people that are there.

2993
02:02:40,390 --> 02:02:43,630
I just think they have a dull battery
for our brain.

2994
02:02:43,910 --> 02:02:45,260
It's uh,
it's,

2995
02:02:45,261 --> 02:02:47,360
and it's,
it's more a obvious

2996
02:02:47,540 --> 02:02:48,420
pronounced,
um,

2997
02:02:48,560 --> 02:02:50,570
you know,
now more than ever because of,

2998
02:02:50,571 --> 02:02:51,500
uh,
you know,

2999
02:02:51,530 --> 02:02:53,690
everyone's got a little bit of a little
bit of a voice,

3000
02:02:53,840 --> 02:02:57,740
Julia old computer,
well more of a voice we get to now we

3001
02:02:57,741 --> 02:03:01,910
get to see not only how they make their
own jokes,

3002
02:03:01,911 --> 02:03:06,320
but how they respond to yours and every,
the combination of both is startling.

3003
02:03:06,740 --> 02:03:09,920
Frightening that.
And also like these people are

3004
02:03:09,921 --> 02:03:13,070
illuminated now where they might've been
just in the shadows before,

3005
02:03:13,400 --> 02:03:15,770
some weird neighborhoods.
And the good thing about it is it people

3006
02:03:15,771 --> 02:03:17,480
that live in those weird neighborhoods
like kids,

3007
02:03:17,870 --> 02:03:22,870
they get exposed to way more shit.
Like there is such a difference between

3008
02:03:23,871 --> 02:03:28,520
when you travel and you go on the road
now and you go to a town like in the

3009
02:03:28,521 --> 02:03:31,700
middle of nowhere versus going to a town
in the middle of nowhere in the 90s.

3010
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:35,900
You go to town in the middle of nowhere
in the 90s you were in an outlier post

3011
02:03:36,020 --> 02:03:38,630
like you were in like some mad max type
situation.

3012
02:03:38,631 --> 02:03:41,660
You're doing some Minnesota Gig in the
middle of nowhere.

3013
02:03:41,690 --> 02:03:46,190
Like these people aren't going to know
shit about the real world.

3014
02:03:46,250 --> 02:03:48,020
I mean they're going to be trapped out
here.

3015
02:03:48,021 --> 02:03:50,240
The town's only got 5,000 people in or
something.

3016
02:03:50,241 --> 02:03:51,600
You're doing like your college.
Yeah.

3017
02:03:51,680 --> 02:03:54,200
Good luck.
Good luck.

3018
02:03:54,380 --> 02:03:57,050
But now they might as well be living in
San Francisco.

3019
02:03:57,070 --> 02:03:58,160
Yeah,
they all have the internet.

3020
02:03:58,190 --> 02:04:00,100
Yeah.
People just know things now.

3021
02:04:00,200 --> 02:04:01,820
They talk now they,
it's funny,

3022
02:04:01,821 --> 02:04:02,600
Doug,
uh,

3023
02:04:02,600 --> 02:04:04,610
he and I,
and he's right,

3024
02:04:04,640 --> 02:04:05,450
like,
but he'll,

3025
02:04:05,450 --> 02:04:08,120
he'll shit on me a little bit about
like,

3026
02:04:08,150 --> 02:04:09,470
we'll go somewhere and I'll go like,
oh,

3027
02:04:09,471 --> 02:04:10,011
it was funny.
He goes,

3028
02:04:10,011 --> 02:04:13,090
that's not the road.
Like he has her real,

3029
02:04:13,100 --> 02:04:14,930
you know,
I'd be like a guys who let me like you

3030
02:04:14,931 --> 02:04:19,030
do like who have really fucking done,
put in the road,

3031
02:04:19,031 --> 02:04:21,080
work across the country,
across the fucking world.

3032
02:04:21,081 --> 02:04:26,081
Like I am admittedly not that person.
And the places that I think are sort of

3033
02:04:27,501 --> 02:04:28,340
a,
you know,

3034
02:04:28,341 --> 02:04:30,470
uh,
out there in middle of nowhere,

3035
02:04:30,830 --> 02:04:33,020
like he'll put me in my place so fast.
I'm like,

3036
02:04:33,021 --> 02:04:34,430
this is nothing.

3037
02:04:34,490 --> 02:04:38,280
What's the darkest place you been lucky
in terms of like exposure to

3038
02:04:38,580 --> 02:04:40,440
the light of enlightenment?
Um,

3039
02:04:42,390 --> 02:04:44,900
one day I did with Henry Phillips once,
uh,

3040
02:04:44,970 --> 02:04:46,890
was in my,
in my twenties,

3041
02:04:46,891 --> 02:04:49,650
a Chris Fairbanks,
Henry Phillips and I went like,

3042
02:04:49,690 --> 02:04:51,210
I,
I don't have any crazy.

3043
02:04:51,211 --> 02:04:53,370
So like I don't do,
uh,

3044
02:04:53,430 --> 02:04:56,790
I don't do the drugs that would lead to
better stories and the ones I have,

3045
02:04:57,240 --> 02:04:59,370
but I,
you know,

3046
02:04:59,371 --> 02:05:04,020
just like where you're just sleeping on
a twin bed with another comedian in a

3047
02:05:04,021 --> 02:05:08,250
kid's room because his parents on the
pizza place that you drove up to perform

3048
02:05:08,251 --> 02:05:11,940
at and there was like a 14 year old
vomiting drunk outside the went like

3049
02:05:11,941 --> 02:05:13,860
all,
it just that kind of shit where you're

3050
02:05:13,861 --> 02:05:15,920
just,
and you're a grownup technically you're

3051
02:05:15,921 --> 02:05:17,430
in the 20s and just going,
what am I,

3052
02:05:18,270 --> 02:05:22,230
what am I here for,
for $50 and a six hour car ride and free

3053
02:05:22,231 --> 02:05:25,410
pizza and the kids twin bed.
And like,

3054
02:05:25,950 --> 02:05:29,400
people are having a contest to see who
can piss the highest outside.

3055
02:05:29,400 --> 02:05:30,990
Like just that kind of shit where I'm
just,

3056
02:05:32,170 --> 02:05:33,260
you know,
I and I,

3057
02:05:33,270 --> 02:05:34,980
and at one point I sort of hate it now I
just,

3058
02:05:34,981 --> 02:05:35,820
you know,
I think,

3059
02:05:36,420 --> 02:05:40,500
I think the friends that I have who go
out and occasionally,

3060
02:05:40,501 --> 02:05:41,880
you know,
take me out to go with them.

3061
02:05:42,120 --> 02:05:45,450
Like I have so much fun now doing stuff
that I used to,

3062
02:05:45,480 --> 02:05:47,490
you know,
that they got tired of I think in my 20.

3063
02:05:47,491 --> 02:05:48,500
So it's interesting.
It's like a,

3064
02:05:48,540 --> 02:05:49,710
um,
a little bit reading,

3065
02:05:49,740 --> 02:05:53,910
big aerated while you realize that those
things can be fun once you become a real

3066
02:05:53,911 --> 02:05:55,050
professional.
First of all,

3067
02:05:55,051 --> 02:05:58,110
in the beginning,
you're so looking forward to working at

3068
02:05:58,111 --> 02:06:03,111
the comedy store or the Improv or
headlining senior name on the low,

3069
02:06:03,670 --> 02:06:04,610
oh,
the billboard look.

3070
02:06:05,220 --> 02:06:07,720
But once you've done that,
then you realize like there's actually

3071
02:06:07,760 --> 02:06:11,790
fun and these places,
the problem is me freaking out about

3072
02:06:11,791 --> 02:06:14,790
this two hours I have to spend in this
shithole bar.

3073
02:06:14,790 --> 02:06:17,880
I should be enjoying the fuck out of it.
I should be coming in here with a

3074
02:06:17,881 --> 02:06:21,270
relaxed attitude,
having a good time and experiencing this

3075
02:06:21,271 --> 02:06:22,560
for what it is instead of experience
like,

3076
02:06:22,590 --> 02:06:24,870
Oh my God,
I'm so frustrated because I really want

3077
02:06:24,871 --> 02:06:27,850
to climb my way as being a professional
comedian,

3078
02:06:27,870 --> 02:06:31,140
but I'm stuck in this shit bar.
But then once you kinda are,

3079
02:06:31,290 --> 02:06:31,971
then you realize like,
no,

3080
02:06:31,971 --> 02:06:32,151
no,
no,

3081
02:06:32,151 --> 02:06:33,570
no.
Those are actually fun.

3082
02:06:33,900 --> 02:06:36,730
Oh yeah.
Now I have my only thing with the,

3083
02:06:36,790 --> 02:06:39,900
with my book and guys like I just say
I'll go anywhere that I haven't been to

3084
02:06:39,901 --> 02:06:41,280
yet,
you know,

3085
02:06:41,340 --> 02:06:42,930
I mean name the place.
If I like it,

3086
02:06:42,931 --> 02:06:44,610
I'll go and if I haven't been there I'll
go.

3087
02:06:44,611 --> 02:06:47,550
Like I love the unknown of it.
But uh,

3088
02:06:47,850 --> 02:06:50,600
but I'm definitely not a a,
you know,

3089
02:06:50,610 --> 02:06:54,030
a veteran of the road,
which is a real issue is non direct

3090
02:06:54,031 --> 02:06:54,864
flights.

3091
02:06:55,320 --> 02:06:57,060
Oh yeah.
Any place where you go those number

3092
02:06:57,061 --> 02:06:59,580
direct flooded and you might get,
yeah,

3093
02:07:00,360 --> 02:07:02,380
yeah.
You could get fucked.

3094
02:07:02,430 --> 02:07:04,800
I mean for this,
this tour that Doug's doing,

3095
02:07:04,801 --> 02:07:06,960
it's,
he's his tour managers driving car out

3096
02:07:06,961 --> 02:07:09,300
from Arizona.
So the east coast mostly they're just

3097
02:07:09,301 --> 02:07:11,460
driving around.
And then I'll meet him out there,

3098
02:07:12,020 --> 02:07:14,340
punches and of dates out there.
That's a good way to do it.

3099
02:07:14,420 --> 02:07:15,580
Yeah,
I know.

3100
02:07:15,581 --> 02:07:18,420
Um,
my manager brought up getting a bus,

3101
02:07:18,900 --> 02:07:19,940
like doing a bus tour.
My,

3102
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:21,900
hey,
doesn't ron white have a bus?

3103
02:07:22,290 --> 02:07:24,760
Uh Oh yeah.
He's got a number of one time.

3104
02:07:25,350 --> 02:07:26,940
Yes.
Yeah,

3105
02:07:26,941 --> 02:07:28,380
but that's wrong.
You know,

3106
02:07:28,381 --> 02:07:30,750
I have young kids like I'm not doing
that bus.

3107
02:07:30,770 --> 02:07:33,090
It's a bus when he has his kids out on
the road for him

3108
02:07:35,370 --> 02:07:36,203
also.

3109
02:07:36,900 --> 02:07:38,650
Um,
I like doing too much other shit.

3110
02:07:39,010 --> 02:07:40,200
Yeah.
I don't like being,

3111
02:07:40,870 --> 02:07:43,090
like,
if I'm just on the road for a month,

3112
02:07:43,200 --> 02:07:44,790
that's not a healthy mind.
Yeah.

3113
02:07:45,130 --> 02:07:49,750
I'm not into that.
I don't want any weird fucking momentum

3114
02:07:49,751 --> 02:07:50,710
taking over my life.

3115
02:07:50,850 --> 02:07:51,270
Well,
that's,

3116
02:07:51,270 --> 02:07:54,090
I feel that way pr like I can't do it
alone.

3117
02:07:54,150 --> 02:07:56,790
I don't want to,
I don't know if I have no interest in

3118
02:07:56,791 --> 02:07:59,240
doing it alone and frankly like I can't,
yeah.

3119
02:08:00,200 --> 02:08:01,033
I can't

3120
02:08:01,250 --> 02:08:04,250
afford to headline and bring people with
me.

3121
02:08:04,251 --> 02:08:06,020
I'm not,
I'm not that kind of a draw.

3122
02:08:06,050 --> 02:08:10,310
So I would much rather go out with
friends who can bring me do a little

3123
02:08:10,311 --> 02:08:12,920
less time and have a good time with a
bunch of friends.

3124
02:08:12,960 --> 02:08:14,190
Yeah.
Like that's fucking,

3125
02:08:14,210 --> 02:08:15,080
no,
it's not the,

3126
02:08:15,081 --> 02:08:17,060
uh,
it's not the,

3127
02:08:17,061 --> 02:08:18,050
you know,
front lines,

3128
02:08:18,051 --> 02:08:20,600
brave way to go about standup comedy,
but it's just like,

3129
02:08:20,601 --> 02:08:22,040
I've,
I've no,

3130
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:24,590
no interest in,
uh,

3131
02:08:24,620 --> 02:08:25,940
in suffering

3132
02:08:26,100 --> 02:08:27,570
no road.
And why should you,

3133
02:08:28,710 --> 02:08:30,610
why do you have to have that interest
like,

3134
02:08:31,070 --> 02:08:31,401
well,
no,

3135
02:08:31,401 --> 02:08:32,690
I mean,
I think that there are certain people

3136
02:08:32,691 --> 02:08:33,620
who are like,
well,

3137
02:08:33,621 --> 02:08:34,251
you're,
you know,

3138
02:08:34,251 --> 02:08:36,800
you're taking the easy way out.
You're not headlining this week.

3139
02:08:36,801 --> 02:08:38,150
You're going out,
you're doing a,

3140
02:08:38,151 --> 02:08:39,590
you know,
a nice,

3141
02:08:39,591 --> 02:08:40,460
uh,
30,

3142
02:08:40,700 --> 02:08:42,680
30,
35 Max.

3143
02:08:42,681 --> 02:08:43,580
And it's like,
yeah,

3144
02:08:43,581 --> 02:08:44,840
well that's what I'm doing this week.

3145
02:08:44,870 --> 02:08:47,900
So what,
who gives a fuck?

3146
02:08:48,530 --> 02:08:50,690
Why is that a bad thing?
I know a lot of guys do that.

3147
02:08:50,720 --> 02:08:52,070
They do that all the time.
They'll headline,

3148
02:08:52,280 --> 02:08:53,600
sometimes they'd go on the road and the
middle.

3149
02:08:53,710 --> 02:08:54,221
Yeah.
Because it,

3150
02:08:54,221 --> 02:08:56,390
shit,
the things that people worry about pick

3151
02:08:56,391 --> 02:08:58,790
apart just like,
so goddamn pointless.

3152
02:08:59,540 --> 02:09:01,990
Plus you can get the opportunity to go
out with standup.

3153
02:09:02,200 --> 02:09:04,250
Like why would,
why would you not want to do that?

3154
02:09:05,080 --> 02:09:07,570
And I figured out a long time ago,
like the,

3155
02:09:07,571 --> 02:09:09,650
the road,
there's two types of roads this road by

3156
02:09:09,651 --> 02:09:11,910
yourself,
but you can get real loan.

3157
02:09:11,940 --> 02:09:14,810
It's depressing.
It can get very lonely or there's a road

3158
02:09:14,811 --> 02:09:15,800
with friends.
Yeah.

3159
02:09:16,770 --> 02:09:18,390
It's amazing.
It's fucking great.

3160
02:09:18,600 --> 02:09:21,210
I remember looking at a window at like
Springfield,

3161
02:09:21,211 --> 02:09:24,450
Illinois.
I was like 19 or 20.

3162
02:09:25,290 --> 02:09:27,890
And I just,
I just looked out the parking lot window

3163
02:09:27,891 --> 02:09:29,010
and I was like,
this time,

3164
02:09:29,040 --> 02:09:31,890
this is,
I love stand up and I love comedy,

3165
02:09:31,891 --> 02:09:32,970
but I said,
this is not

3166
02:09:33,660 --> 02:09:34,330
for me.
This,

3167
02:09:34,330 --> 02:09:38,010
this will destroy me.
I did all of my gigs on the road by

3168
02:09:38,011 --> 02:09:40,590
myself until I could afford to not do it
anymore.

3169
02:09:40,920 --> 02:09:42,220
And then,
um,

3170
02:09:42,240 --> 02:09:46,470
right around the end of the nineties,
I started taking Chris Mcguire on the

3171
02:09:46,471 --> 02:09:47,400
road with me a lot.
Yeah,

3172
02:09:47,410 --> 02:09:48,243
yeah,
yeah.

3173
02:09:48,290 --> 02:09:50,400
And that's a long time.
Once I could afford,

3174
02:09:50,540 --> 02:09:53,220
and it costs money.
Like you'd have to pay for the flight

3175
02:09:53,221 --> 02:09:54,750
and pay for the hotel room.
But I'm like,

3176
02:09:55,050 --> 02:09:58,710
I would rather be out a few hundred
bucks here and there and have a good

3177
02:09:58,711 --> 02:10:01,170
time.
It made the in the experience infinitely

3178
02:10:01,171 --> 02:10:01,600
better.

3179
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:05,080
I went to do Phoenix recently just for a
night and uh,

3180
02:10:05,290 --> 02:10:08,860
to get like some,
some time in that I couldn't get an La

3181
02:10:09,220 --> 02:10:11,170
and uh,
so I went out there for the night to do

3182
02:10:11,171 --> 02:10:13,150
a long set and uh,
I said,

3183
02:10:13,151 --> 02:10:15,280
I'm bringing my friend and I realize I
either who you're trying to get,

3184
02:10:15,281 --> 02:10:17,830
her name's Chris and uh,
they were like,

3185
02:10:17,831 --> 02:10:18,491
oh,
you know,

3186
02:10:18,491 --> 02:10:19,030
she's,
we're,

3187
02:10:19,030 --> 02:10:21,160
where's she performed whenever I go.
She's my best friend from college.

3188
02:10:21,161 --> 02:10:23,020
He's really funny and she does some
standup and I was like,

3189
02:10:23,030 --> 02:10:24,940
I'm bringing her with me.
Like I like,

3190
02:10:25,170 --> 02:10:25,811
I was like,
fuck it.

3191
02:10:25,811 --> 02:10:29,650
Like it wasn't,
and she's more of a comedic actress who

3192
02:10:29,651 --> 02:10:32,380
does some live performance stuff and she
did fucking grade.

3193
02:10:32,381 --> 02:10:33,440
She had to do 10,
15 minutes.

3194
02:10:33,441 --> 02:10:34,100
She was,
she was

3195
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:34,933
perfect.
I'm like,

3196
02:10:35,510 --> 02:10:38,240
I could have brought someone who's been
doing comedy 12 years.

3197
02:10:38,241 --> 02:10:38,610
I was like,
I,

3198
02:10:38,610 --> 02:10:40,720
I wanted to go with my best friend.
Right.

3199
02:10:41,090 --> 02:10:42,680
That's what I wanted to do.
I want to have fun.

3200
02:10:42,980 --> 02:10:43,813
Fun.
Yeah.

3201
02:10:44,150 --> 02:10:45,350
Yeah.
It makes it way better.

3202
02:10:45,351 --> 02:10:46,640
You're in Minnesota,
but your home,

3203
02:10:46,660 --> 02:10:47,540
yeah.
You know,

3204
02:10:47,600 --> 02:10:49,070
you're in Cleveland,
but your home,

3205
02:10:50,480 --> 02:10:52,310
it's the best.
It's the best.

3206
02:10:52,460 --> 02:10:56,450
And the camaraderie between comedians.
It's like such an unusual camaraderie.

3207
02:10:56,570 --> 02:10:58,760
It's very unusual.
Well,

3208
02:10:58,761 --> 02:10:59,780
it's,
it's also,

3209
02:10:59,781 --> 02:11:00,541
uh,
I got,

3210
02:11:00,541 --> 02:11:01,820
I remember being on the,
um,

3211
02:11:02,090 --> 02:11:02,780
the,
uh,

3212
02:11:02,780 --> 02:11:04,010
the track,
like we were,

3213
02:11:04,040 --> 02:11:06,550
you know,
Doug's a cranky traveler and a,

3214
02:11:06,560 --> 02:11:08,840
I mean he'll tell you firsthand.
And we were,

3215
02:11:08,841 --> 02:11:09,211
uh,
we,

3216
02:11:09,211 --> 02:11:12,620
we landed lax and it was like,
it just take a different airlines.

3217
02:11:12,621 --> 02:11:16,760
We had to get on like a shuttle to go
somewhere like a shuttle after the plane

3218
02:11:16,761 --> 02:11:17,780
is like,
you know,

3219
02:11:17,781 --> 02:11:21,380
when someone doesn't like surprises like
that sits on the shuttle.

3220
02:11:21,380 --> 02:11:24,140
But it's just like constant,
like jokes about like,

3221
02:11:24,650 --> 02:11:28,880
like we're going to Auschwitz but like
loud Auschwitz jokes on like the,

3222
02:11:28,881 --> 02:11:31,310
you know,
American Airlines shuttle with like

3223
02:11:31,311 --> 02:11:34,430
people around you.
I'm a little more sensitive to like,

3224
02:11:34,431 --> 02:11:36,020
I'll look around and go like,
oh,

3225
02:11:36,440 --> 02:11:38,300
we're not like tier,
but there's,

3226
02:11:38,340 --> 02:11:39,140
it's,
it's,

3227
02:11:39,140 --> 02:11:41,450
there's,
there's nothing better than being around

3228
02:11:41,451 --> 02:11:45,500
other people who like speak your
language and you don't have to explain

3229
02:11:45,501 --> 02:11:47,660
anything ever.
Oh yeah,

3230
02:11:47,960 --> 02:11:49,550
yeah,
yeah,

3231
02:11:50,810 --> 02:11:52,490
yeah.
That's one of the things that Doug said

3232
02:11:52,491 --> 02:11:53,870
to me once.
It was hilarious.

3233
02:11:53,871 --> 02:11:54,890
He goes,
he goes,

3234
02:11:54,891 --> 02:11:58,940
I think I could quit comedy,
but I could never quit comedians.

3235
02:11:59,070 --> 02:12:04,070
Oh,
that's like a sensitive shit is deep.

3236
02:12:05,210 --> 02:12:07,130
I was telling him like,
if everything goes wrong,

3237
02:12:07,370 --> 02:12:10,760
he could clearly organize some sort of a
village in Bisbee and all the comics

3238
02:12:10,761 --> 02:12:12,430
moved to him.
I,

3239
02:12:12,431 --> 02:12:13,101
uh,
I'm,

3240
02:12:13,101 --> 02:12:14,690
I'm,
I'm considering,

3241
02:12:15,080 --> 02:12:15,771
I got,
I got,

3242
02:12:15,771 --> 02:12:16,720
I gotta have a,
I have a,

3243
02:12:16,850 --> 02:12:18,140
a busy realtor.

3244
02:12:18,500 --> 02:12:19,333
Yeah,
I do.

3245
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:21,420
Thinking about buying not gonna.
I'm not gonna.

3246
02:12:21,440 --> 02:12:22,201
I'm not,
I have to,

3247
02:12:22,201 --> 02:12:23,470
I have to be in la.
My,

3248
02:12:23,500 --> 02:12:25,530
my work is in La.
Doesn't have to be in ally,

3249
02:12:25,580 --> 02:12:29,270
but I,
I haven't found a place that offers me

3250
02:12:30,140 --> 02:12:32,390
the way that place does.
I haven't found a place that offers me

3251
02:12:32,391 --> 02:12:37,130
everything.
I don't realize I miss when I'm in La,

3252
02:12:37,150 --> 02:12:39,150
like what are the second I get there?
It's,

3253
02:12:39,151 --> 02:12:43,760
it's a sense of calm.
It's a sense of reprioritizing your day

3254
02:12:43,761 --> 02:12:44,960
around.
Um,

3255
02:12:45,470 --> 02:12:48,500
things that have nothing to do with show
business and you know,

3256
02:12:48,501 --> 02:12:50,990
being around people who aren't in the
business.

3257
02:12:50,991 --> 02:12:52,130
I mean,
most of my friends weirdly,

3258
02:12:52,131 --> 02:12:53,960
are not comedians like that I hang out
with everyday,

3259
02:12:54,020 --> 02:12:56,090
but I don't know.
I mean the other day,

3260
02:12:56,091 --> 02:13:00,800
like I was there and we had a little
like pickup basketball game plan for

3261
02:13:00,801 --> 02:13:03,800
like 9:00 AM and like eight people
showed up to watch me play this dude

3262
02:13:03,810 --> 02:13:04,460
Kenny.

3263
02:13:04,460 --> 02:13:09,460
It's just small town kind of shit.
But with people who seem to have figured

3264
02:13:09,591 --> 02:13:12,260
out why they're there too.
And um,

3265
02:13:12,290 --> 02:13:14,630
I just really dig it.
I dig the whole vibe.

3266
02:13:15,050 --> 02:13:16,940
I dig,
I dig the city,

3267
02:13:17,270 --> 02:13:20,150
the town or whatever.
I liked the drive there even.

3268
02:13:20,151 --> 02:13:22,670
And I think it's a drive from La and now
it's,

3269
02:13:22,671 --> 02:13:24,800
I haven't driven from La and flying to
Tucson,

3270
02:13:25,200 --> 02:13:26,840
um,
drive like an hour and a half.

3271
02:13:26,841 --> 02:13:29,840
But I always was obsessed with like
getting a place and like Costa Rica and

3272
02:13:29,841 --> 02:13:32,460
Nicaragua or like anytime I go to
another country and I'm like,

3273
02:13:32,490 --> 02:13:33,181
oh,
this is it.

3274
02:13:33,181 --> 02:13:34,760
This is my spot.
Really.

3275
02:13:34,790 --> 02:13:35,930
And there's a lot.
Yeah.

3276
02:13:37,290 --> 02:13:39,600
You travel a lot when you were a kid.
I think so.

3277
02:13:39,601 --> 02:13:43,290
I think there's a part of me that is a
little bit of a problem staying still

3278
02:13:43,291 --> 02:13:45,700
because I had never knew a,
you know,

3279
02:13:45,720 --> 02:13:47,280
that kind of consistency.

3280
02:13:47,700 --> 02:13:50,700
But the thing I realized about Bisbee,
which,

3281
02:13:50,730 --> 02:13:53,520
which again is so like Doug's thing that
it's almost funny,

3282
02:13:53,521 --> 02:13:56,120
but it's,
Aye.

3283
02:13:56,780 --> 02:13:57,900
Aye,
Aye.

3284
02:13:57,920 --> 02:14:01,470
It's all those feelings that I had in
even in other countries where it was

3285
02:14:01,471 --> 02:14:02,460
like,
it's getting away,

3286
02:14:02,461 --> 02:14:04,860
but it's close enough.
You know?

3287
02:14:04,890 --> 02:14:06,810
It's just,
but you still feel like you're on the

3288
02:14:06,811 --> 02:14:10,980
outskirts and you feel like you go back
in time a little bit there,

3289
02:14:11,910 --> 02:14:13,650
you know?
And there's something refreshing about

3290
02:14:13,651 --> 02:14:15,960
waking up and going,
I'm going to go get my coffee at the one

3291
02:14:15,961 --> 02:14:17,730
coffee place.
I'm going to go get my,

3292
02:14:18,060 --> 02:14:20,310
this kind of food at the one place has
this kind of food,

3293
02:14:20,311 --> 02:14:22,530
you know,
I'm going to go get my fresh eggs from

3294
02:14:22,531 --> 02:14:24,760
the lady who has fresh eggs and come
from her chicken.

3295
02:14:24,780 --> 02:14:28,560
Like it's just shit that I don't do here
and I didn't even think I wanted to do

3296
02:14:28,561 --> 02:14:32,230
until I got there.
I get it.

3297
02:14:33,370 --> 02:14:35,470
I like those places.
I Love Boulder,

3298
02:14:35,920 --> 02:14:38,920
which is much bigger than Bisbee but
still for the same reasons.

3299
02:14:39,430 --> 02:14:40,263
I think,
um,

3300
02:14:40,540 --> 02:14:44,260
what we do specifically also like you're
in front of crowds all the time.

3301
02:14:44,320 --> 02:14:48,340
I think there's like a real benefit to
being away from crowds and just smaller

3302
02:14:48,341 --> 02:14:48,911
groups.
People,

3303
02:14:48,911 --> 02:14:52,420
it's more relaxed
and it's also,

3304
02:14:52,450 --> 02:14:54,130
you know,
I think you go somewhere at a certain

3305
02:14:54,131 --> 02:14:56,620
number of times you meet kind of the
people that are there.

3306
02:14:56,621 --> 02:14:59,290
I mean obviously I've met a lot of
Doug's friends and stuff and

3307
02:15:00,970 --> 02:15:02,800
you know,
once you're not bothered,

3308
02:15:02,801 --> 02:15:04,090
you go from a place of like,
ah,

3309
02:15:04,091 --> 02:15:06,070
I wonder if anyone's going to know.
I know it annoys you think you're like,

3310
02:15:06,071 --> 02:15:07,030
I really like it here.
Then you're like,

3311
02:15:07,031 --> 02:15:07,930
oh,
I really love it here.

3312
02:15:07,931 --> 02:15:10,990
Then you're like,
I think I could have a place here.

3313
02:15:10,991 --> 02:15:15,991
So you're thinking about legitimately
picking up shop and moving to Bisbee and

3314
02:15:16,091 --> 02:15:18,670
then keeping an apartment here and then
when you're not working like in

3315
02:15:18,671 --> 02:15:21,400
Hollywood shit,
you live in Brisbane and you go on the

3316
02:15:21,401 --> 02:15:22,330
road from there.
Yeah,

3317
02:15:22,331 --> 02:15:23,680
not quite,
but I'm Ben.

3318
02:15:23,681 --> 02:15:28,681
I am thinking about having something
consistent that like I will probably

3319
02:15:29,921 --> 02:15:34,720
have to be here the majority of the time
for the foreseeable future,

3320
02:15:35,080 --> 02:15:39,220
but I'm curious about what it'd be like
to have my own little spot that I could

3321
02:15:39,221 --> 02:15:41,950
go to when I want to and I,
you know,

3322
02:15:41,951 --> 02:15:43,150
in,
in doing it and if not,

3323
02:15:43,151 --> 02:15:45,540
I realize I can go for a weekend and it
feels like a good it,

3324
02:15:45,550 --> 02:15:46,570
you decompress.

3325
02:15:46,780 --> 02:15:49,070
Fuck Ya.
You know there's a cave for sale.

3326
02:15:49,280 --> 02:15:50,580
Yeah,
I know he's trying to get,

3327
02:15:50,890 --> 02:15:53,740
did he see his trying to get so far,
I feel like,

3328
02:15:53,741 --> 02:15:56,290
I don't know if you are interested in,
but I know me Kreischer,

3329
02:15:56,291 --> 02:15:59,290
Roseanne,
norm and Doug,

3330
02:15:59,650 --> 02:16:03,430
like the people who have expressed
interest in this cave of going in and

3331
02:16:03,431 --> 02:16:04,390
getting it,
I was like,

3332
02:16:04,420 --> 02:16:06,490
oh,
I would live in that fucking insane

3333
02:16:06,491 --> 02:16:08,440
asylum in a heartbeat.
Dope.

3334
02:16:08,550 --> 02:16:09,700
Yeah.
It's amazing.

3335
02:16:10,060 --> 02:16:12,570
It's super dope.
You should get it thought about it a

3336
02:16:12,650 --> 02:16:13,840
couple of times from,
to be honest with you.

3337
02:16:14,320 --> 02:16:15,550
He should.
Yeah.

3338
02:16:15,730 --> 02:16:17,080
I mean I'm looking at like a,
you know,

3339
02:16:17,081 --> 02:16:19,720
a little craftsman.
One,

3340
02:16:19,721 --> 02:16:21,820
two bedroom.
I want just a little place to go with my

3341
02:16:21,821 --> 02:16:23,230
dog and stuff,
but you know,

3342
02:16:23,231 --> 02:16:25,660
if you get the cave,
I'll stay there and clean it for you at

3343
02:16:25,661 --> 02:16:28,220
the cave or knows where you live.
That's true.

3344
02:16:28,630 --> 02:16:30,090
Yeah.
Get a skid.

3345
02:16:30,091 --> 02:16:31,840
It get to keep outside.
Oh,

3346
02:16:31,841 --> 02:16:33,460
that's it.
That's what I need to keep outside.

3347
02:16:33,520 --> 02:16:35,920
And some wild havoline has roaming
around your yard.

3348
02:16:35,960 --> 02:16:39,520
You could hire a number of people there
who would gladly stand in the front of

3349
02:16:39,521 --> 02:16:41,320
your driveway with a gun.
Yeah.

3350
02:16:41,330 --> 02:16:43,390
Sweet.
How many guns they have.

3351
02:16:43,391 --> 02:16:44,890
Backup guns.
I don't know.

3352
02:16:47,140 --> 02:16:50,620
Living in a cave would be the shit.
If you could live in a cave.

3353
02:16:52,210 --> 02:16:53,600
It's carved.
None of the mountain there is.

3354
02:16:54,020 --> 02:16:56,620
It feels right for you and he's got it.
What I'm saying?

3355
02:16:56,621 --> 02:17:01,480
I'm saying that so far and Doug thought
10 people dug me.

3356
02:17:01,600 --> 02:17:02,590
Keep clicking.
Roseanne.

3357
02:17:02,591 --> 02:17:03,940
Bert,
you have to live with Bert.

3358
02:17:04,210 --> 02:17:05,470
I don't know.
I don't have to live with them.

3359
02:17:05,500 --> 02:17:09,250
I'm going to buy it to come stay over,
but you drink too much.

3360
02:17:09,520 --> 02:17:12,250
She can't live with you bro.
Look at this thing.

3361
02:17:12,280 --> 02:17:13,680
This thing's the shit.
Yeah,

3362
02:17:13,710 --> 02:17:16,230
you see the wall.
I mean all the outdoor stuff to the

3363
02:17:18,080 --> 02:17:20,290
right.
Some awesome stuff in this house.

3364
02:17:20,320 --> 02:17:22,330
I was thinking that I write my best.
That's what I,

3365
02:17:22,331 --> 02:17:24,850
that's what I keep thinking.
I keep trying to find the house that I

3366
02:17:24,851 --> 02:17:26,740
think I'll write and don't jump up
though.

3367
02:17:26,741 --> 02:17:28,120
You hit your head and die.

3368
02:17:28,120 --> 02:17:29,650
No one will find you.
Look at that.

3369
02:17:29,651 --> 02:17:31,870
That's the bed.
The bed is carved into the ground now.

3370
02:17:31,880 --> 02:17:33,400
That's like a,
that's like,

3371
02:17:33,760 --> 02:17:36,100
is that a fireplace in that?
Oh that's beautiful.

3372
02:17:36,101 --> 02:17:39,760
Got like a carpet and some pillows and
then you send a fireplace,

3373
02:17:41,140 --> 02:17:42,520
a yoga room.
Oh,

3374
02:17:42,521 --> 02:17:46,330
pretentious.
You have a room to do your yoga.

3375
02:17:46,331 --> 02:17:49,390
That's a little built in audio type
thing.

3376
02:17:49,600 --> 02:17:50,890
That's a real house.
Yeah.

3377
02:17:50,891 --> 02:17:55,030
And then a real house secure all this
land and water and shit.

3378
02:17:55,060 --> 02:17:58,540
So the real ass you take uh,
some Rambo type character again.

3379
02:17:58,541 --> 02:18:00,600
That's where I would work there.
Back it up,

3380
02:18:00,700 --> 02:18:02,200
backed it up.
Let's see where Morgan will work.

3381
02:18:02,260 --> 02:18:04,340
I work at that table.
Dude.

3382
02:18:04,341 --> 02:18:06,730
Would you have coffee and your wife be
pouring you the coffee?

3383
02:18:06,731 --> 02:18:09,490
Like a hunters Thompson,
that classic picture of him at Big Sur

3384
02:18:09,930 --> 02:18:14,440
and I need a wife.
You already have one tired a shit.

3385
02:18:14,840 --> 02:18:17,000
That lady who's trying to get you to
have a kid now.

3386
02:18:17,001 --> 02:18:19,090
My housekeeper generations.
She's your life partner.

3387
02:18:19,210 --> 02:18:22,090
She really is fucking amazing view.
Holy Shit.

3388
02:18:22,210 --> 02:18:23,860
Yeah.
I might have to buy their cave.

3389
02:18:24,010 --> 02:18:24,843
Keep going.

3390
02:18:26,960 --> 02:18:29,920
It's like if we were going to move to a
new spot,

3391
02:18:30,040 --> 02:18:34,780
this would be a spot to move to get in.
I would get in bikini shape for that

3392
02:18:34,781 --> 02:18:38,740
little lagoon plus to give me six months
before you,

3393
02:18:38,860 --> 02:18:41,050
before you buy it,
you could get resident tags

3394
02:18:42,940 --> 02:18:45,640
for animals and animals and the
mountains around there.

3395
02:18:46,600 --> 02:18:48,040
Don't shoot my dog.
No,

3396
02:18:48,041 --> 02:18:52,070
not your dive dogs to God.
It's don't accidentally.

3397
02:18:52,120 --> 02:18:54,500
I know,
but I feel like you're also got a

3398
02:18:54,501 --> 02:18:56,210
trigger finger,
itchy trigger finger thing.

3399
02:18:56,220 --> 02:18:58,570
So what you have to give the wrong
impression of me.

3400
02:18:59,590 --> 02:19:01,270
Thank you.
Think of more volatile than I am.

3401
02:19:02,140 --> 02:19:03,670
Um,
how many people live in Bisbee?

3402
02:19:04,830 --> 02:19:05,920
I don't know.
What is it?

3403
02:19:06,640 --> 02:19:08,020
Thousands,
five days.

3404
02:19:08,030 --> 02:19:10,000
10 hour at 5,000.
I don't know.

3405
02:19:10,040 --> 02:19:12,580
I have no fucking idea.
The elevation is really high.

3406
02:19:12,581 --> 02:19:14,890
That playing basketball was hard.
Like what's the elevation?

3407
02:19:14,950 --> 02:19:16,270
It's like a mile high.
It's crazy.

3408
02:19:16,271 --> 02:19:17,101
It's like,
yeah,

3409
02:19:17,101 --> 02:19:17,801
it's,
it's a,

3410
02:19:17,801 --> 02:19:18,430
I was,
I was,

3411
02:19:18,430 --> 02:19:19,120
I was,
uh,

3412
02:19:19,120 --> 02:19:20,870
I was deep,
deep.

3413
02:19:21,490 --> 02:19:24,880
I would say two baskets in 5,000 filers
lean in.

3414
02:19:25,060 --> 02:19:28,430
I was leaning over real hard.
I could barely play.

3415
02:19:28,610 --> 02:19:33,610
City was wow.
Population is 5,002 elevations.

3416
02:19:34,971 --> 02:19:38,300
5,000 populations.
5,005 five on both.

3417
02:19:38,330 --> 02:19:39,520
It's perfect.
Yeah.

3418
02:19:39,640 --> 02:19:41,000
I got a little,
this last time I was there,

3419
02:19:41,001 --> 02:19:42,740
I got a two bedroom,
airbnb,

3420
02:19:42,890 --> 02:19:45,410
little house hot tub.
While it should 85 bucks a night.

3421
02:19:45,411 --> 02:19:47,000
Two bedroom house.
That's a good deal.

3422
02:19:48,860 --> 02:19:50,120
What else?
Is there a gym there?

3423
02:19:50,780 --> 02:19:52,460
Uh,
you know what you got to ask Doug

3424
02:19:52,461 --> 02:19:54,900
because uh,
his buddy who says it just hesitant.

3425
02:19:54,940 --> 02:19:57,470
He just joined a gym that's like a
minute away.

3426
02:19:57,471 --> 02:20:00,190
Like that's right there.
Then they talk about that in Tucson.

3427
02:20:00,230 --> 02:20:01,970
He says an hour and a half drive,
hour and a half drive.

3428
02:20:02,330 --> 02:20:04,400
It's not that bad and really do
something.

3429
02:20:04,700 --> 02:20:07,070
It's like going to Santa Barbara.
That's what I said to like,

3430
02:20:07,071 --> 02:20:08,060
uh,
like everyone I work with,

3431
02:20:08,061 --> 02:20:09,290
I was like,
I'm going to leave.

3432
02:20:09,320 --> 02:20:10,910
I can be back in three hour.
Basically.

3433
02:20:10,911 --> 02:20:14,420
I just said let me know if I need to
come back for any kind of emergency shit

3434
02:20:14,421 --> 02:20:16,370
and I'll be back.
But wow.

3435
02:20:16,730 --> 02:20:19,340
Easy to go in the mountains.
Just get cold there at all.

3436
02:20:19,950 --> 02:20:21,560
Uh,
I think you get gets cold at night

3437
02:20:21,561 --> 02:20:22,970
sometimes,
but you got to say it's,

3438
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:26,450
the weather's amazing in that,
like I've talked to,

3439
02:20:26,451 --> 02:20:27,660
I taught,
my dad called me was like,

3440
02:20:27,680 --> 02:20:31,030
I hear it's real hot there and I'm like,
it's so breezy constantly in Brisbane.

3441
02:20:31,040 --> 02:20:31,880
It feels,
it gets,

3442
02:20:31,881 --> 02:20:34,340
it gets really hot,
but not as hot as it does in other areas

3443
02:20:34,341 --> 02:20:36,230
because the elevation,
yeah.

3444
02:20:36,231 --> 02:20:38,780
5,500 feet is fucking high,
I would imagine.

3445
02:20:38,781 --> 02:20:39,614
Yeah.

3446
02:20:40,460 --> 02:20:41,293
Interesting.

3447
02:20:42,180 --> 02:20:44,490
You gotta do I slow Cape's economy?
They're like,

3448
02:20:44,491 --> 02:20:46,140
what do people do?
Nothing.

3449
02:20:46,510 --> 02:20:48,240
All the why they're there.
I don't know.

3450
02:20:48,450 --> 02:20:49,230
I just pile that.
Oh,

3451
02:20:49,230 --> 02:20:51,030
I don't know why anybody else is there.
I mean,

3452
02:20:51,031 --> 02:20:53,490
I know why I go,
how many people have moved there because

3453
02:20:53,491 --> 02:20:55,890
of Doug?
I think a hundred.

3454
02:20:56,100 --> 02:20:57,930
I think more than people would think.
Yeah.

3455
02:20:58,080 --> 02:21:00,600
It seems like,
it seems like there's quite a few folks

3456
02:21:00,601 --> 02:21:02,370
who hundreds?
No,

3457
02:21:02,371 --> 02:21:03,310
I don't think so.
No,

3458
02:21:03,320 --> 02:21:04,770
I,
I that I don't think so.

3459
02:21:04,771 --> 02:21:07,020
I mean it's,
it's almost,

3460
02:21:07,021 --> 02:21:09,240
uh,
like I remember talking to Doug about

3461
02:21:09,241 --> 02:21:12,030
liking it and I almost felt like I had
to ask him like,

3462
02:21:12,031 --> 02:21:13,020
Hey,
I think I'm going to come out.

3463
02:21:13,021 --> 02:21:13,561
Like,
like,

3464
02:21:13,561 --> 02:21:16,080
is that okay?
I know it's your fucking town.

3465
02:21:16,081 --> 02:21:18,030
Like it's,
it's,

3466
02:21:18,090 --> 02:21:20,130
you want to be the one who finds it.
I mean,

3467
02:21:20,131 --> 02:21:21,660
I've been at like four,
nine brought my friend and I bought my,

3468
02:21:21,720 --> 02:21:24,810
my buddy bill from just a good friend of
mine out here.

3469
02:21:24,810 --> 02:21:27,750
Like W we hit the road like it's,
I would,

3470
02:21:28,440 --> 02:21:31,950
it's a kind of place that I want to
bring people to and show them to doug.

3471
02:21:31,951 --> 02:21:33,480
Get excited when you thought about
moving there.

3472
02:21:34,320 --> 02:21:35,610
I think,
uh,

3473
02:21:36,120 --> 02:21:38,010
you know what?
I can't tell it's you,

3474
02:21:38,011 --> 02:21:42,030
you can't tell that seems happy.
But then also there is a part of,

3475
02:21:42,360 --> 02:21:47,190
when a place is somebody thing you don't
want to intrude intrude.

3476
02:21:47,270 --> 02:21:47,911
Right.
I do that.

3477
02:21:47,911 --> 02:21:49,500
So I don't know.
I mean,

3478
02:21:49,501 --> 02:21:51,960
I also don't think I'll let you know.
I would just love a little,

3479
02:21:51,990 --> 02:21:56,990
a little second little rustic place
where I do nothing.

3480
02:21:58,020 --> 02:21:59,910
Do I do all my nothing.
I'll watch it.

3481
02:22:00,950 --> 02:22:03,750
I'll live in your cave.
Would you want to watch the game?

3482
02:22:03,780 --> 02:22:05,040
I'll watch the cave.
Would you?

3483
02:22:05,150 --> 02:22:07,380
Yeah.
No weird stuff though right now.

3484
02:22:09,810 --> 02:22:13,530
Whenever you let a comic wall watch your
house and then like are,

3485
02:22:13,550 --> 02:22:17,400
I mean I might have some processed sugar
in the cave if that's like I going to be

3486
02:22:17,401 --> 02:22:19,170
a big problem for you is going to be an
issue.

3487
02:22:19,540 --> 02:22:21,210
Yeah.
It's super bad for you Morgan.

3488
02:22:21,750 --> 02:22:23,580
Keep it out of your body and keep it out
of my cave.

3489
02:22:23,640 --> 02:22:26,010
I just take a picture of like Doritos in
front

3490
02:22:26,010 --> 02:22:27,690
of your favorite places in a cave.

3491
02:22:28,010 --> 02:22:29,800
Hmm.
It's funny.

3492
02:22:29,801 --> 02:22:31,290
If they can't get anybody to buy that
cave,

3493
02:22:32,200 --> 02:22:34,110
I would feel like that would be
something that people be trying to buy

3494
02:22:34,111 --> 02:22:37,410
up.
The problem is try selling it,

3495
02:22:39,170 --> 02:22:42,900
trying to sell a cave to someone who
could afford a $3 million cave like

3496
02:22:42,901 --> 02:22:45,150
this.
Not a lot of those dudes out there or

3497
02:22:45,151 --> 02:22:47,250
women.
This cave houses in France.

3498
02:22:47,390 --> 02:22:49,040
Oh.

3499
02:22:49,400 --> 02:22:50,360
Oh,
you're balling.

3500
02:22:50,480 --> 02:22:52,700
You're balling so strong.
You're on the side of a mountain.

3501
02:22:53,010 --> 02:22:54,950
Hope it doesn't go all pump.
Pay On your ass though.

3502
02:22:55,010 --> 02:22:57,830
But you know what?
You could do a lot of this shit with the

3503
02:22:57,831 --> 02:23:00,890
cave and Bisbee you could do a lot of
that low seating.

3504
02:23:00,891 --> 02:23:02,510
I see it happening.
I'm worth now.

3505
02:23:02,511 --> 02:23:04,200
I really want you to get that fucking
okay.

3506
02:23:04,320 --> 02:23:08,190
How would an amphitheater outside
amphitheater folk singers come by?

3507
02:23:08,940 --> 02:23:10,950
There's a small little amphitheater in
um,

3508
02:23:11,010 --> 02:23:12,580
in the park at busy.
Been busy.

3509
02:23:12,880 --> 02:23:13,531
Yeah,
a little one.

3510
02:23:13,531 --> 02:23:14,370
You could do a show there.

3511
02:23:14,770 --> 02:23:16,400
This a different one.
Oh,

3512
02:23:16,450 --> 02:23:18,610
I just typed in the cave house in
Bisbee,

3513
02:23:18,611 --> 02:23:20,950
but a lot of like cave houses are just
coming up to him.

3514
02:23:21,010 --> 02:23:22,590
I saw.
Yeah,

3515
02:23:22,600 --> 02:23:26,680
I saw a special on one of them
television shows about houses where

3516
02:23:26,681 --> 02:23:28,780
they're just,
just all cave houses.

3517
02:23:28,810 --> 02:23:32,710
People build houses in caves,
carving art into the wall.

3518
02:23:32,760 --> 02:23:35,080
Oh,
we're going back back to the caves.

3519
02:23:35,260 --> 02:23:36,850
Well,
just people are bored.

3520
02:23:36,970 --> 02:23:39,220
They just want something interesting.
Look at this fucking place.

3521
02:23:39,340 --> 02:23:43,750
Jesus Christ.
[inaudible] where are he lives?

3522
02:23:44,080 --> 02:23:47,410
So God damn important.
Every place has a different feel to it.

3523
02:23:47,470 --> 02:23:49,810
That's why the idea of countries is so
fucked up,

3524
02:23:50,170 --> 02:23:52,060
stopping people from living somewhere.
Awesome.

3525
02:23:52,560 --> 02:23:52,760
Okay.

3526
02:23:52,760 --> 02:23:53,091
Well.
Yeah,

3527
02:23:53,091 --> 02:23:54,400
I mean that's,
it is,

3528
02:23:54,401 --> 02:23:55,234
it's,
it's,

3529
02:23:55,250 --> 02:23:57,710
if you told me like,
I can't go to busy anymore,

3530
02:23:57,711 --> 02:23:58,441
I can't go to her,
you know,

3531
02:23:58,441 --> 02:23:59,810
like I perfect example

3532
02:24:00,350 --> 02:24:02,380
pissed.
Somebody drew a line around busy.

3533
02:24:02,810 --> 02:24:05,450
No,
this is Biz Banya now you can't come in

3534
02:24:05,451 --> 02:24:06,780
unless you have papers.
What are you,

3535
02:24:06,800 --> 02:24:09,080
do you have any exceptional talents?
And we would want to let you into

3536
02:24:09,081 --> 02:24:11,150
Brisbane Ia.
Alright.

3537
02:24:11,590 --> 02:24:12,423
I mean,
Shit,

3538
02:24:13,010 --> 02:24:15,290
just 300 years ago,
it wasn't even real,

3539
02:24:15,560 --> 02:24:17,570
right?
300 years ago there was no American.

3540
02:24:18,740 --> 02:24:22,670
It's not too hard to believe that one
day Biz Banya could be a real thing.

3541
02:24:22,940 --> 02:24:25,430
Maybe doug takes over,
maybe they invent some stem cells.

3542
02:24:25,790 --> 02:24:29,270
They'll let doug live for a long time,
like way longer than he's supposed to.

3543
02:24:29,310 --> 02:24:31,070
I'm like five more years.
500,

3544
02:24:31,520 --> 02:24:36,520
500 years and 300 years from now,
doug is like some crazy old wizard mayor

3545
02:24:37,570 --> 02:24:39,040
is this is all the people in his,

3546
02:24:39,730 --> 02:24:40,640
oh,
those guys,

3547
02:24:40,940 --> 02:24:42,720
those guys have moved there.
Well that's Andy.

3548
02:24:42,721 --> 02:24:43,970
I know Andy Andrews,
Andy,

3549
02:24:44,220 --> 02:24:46,440
uh,
far green underwear,

3550
02:24:47,010 --> 02:24:49,090
black hat.
And then there's,

3551
02:24:49,130 --> 02:24:50,230
um,
I don't know.

3552
02:24:50,240 --> 02:24:54,990
So the dude's probably Biz Banians.
They'd need to a Biz Banya need to

3553
02:24:55,050 --> 02:24:57,510
declared their own country.
It's not a bad move.

3554
02:24:57,690 --> 02:24:58,710
Right.
This is going to stop you.

3555
02:24:58,980 --> 02:25:00,420
No one's ever going to lie there.
We'll leave you alone.

3556
02:25:00,540 --> 02:25:01,470
Just keep it low key.

3557
02:25:02,060 --> 02:25:03,770
It's cool.
You're five minutes from Mexico too.

3558
02:25:03,771 --> 02:25:06,130
You do a little drive and in Mexico,
shit goes down

3559
02:25:06,790 --> 02:25:08,890
south of the border.
Ooh.

3560
02:25:09,100 --> 02:25:11,050
Ooh.
Take the money and run.

3561
02:25:12,700 --> 02:25:13,451
All right,
Morgan,

3562
02:25:13,451 --> 02:25:15,040
I think we've taken too much of your
time.

3563
02:25:15,220 --> 02:25:17,380
It's almost 2:00 PM done almost three
hours.

3564
02:25:17,560 --> 02:25:19,180
What?
Yeah,

3565
02:25:19,670 --> 02:25:20,503
that's crazy.

3566
02:25:20,850 --> 02:25:22,920
God,
I can't wait to look at the comments.

3567
02:25:22,960 --> 02:25:24,430
Don't read that Shit.

3568
02:25:25,190 --> 02:25:26,910
Are you going to read that and know
that's why I read.

3569
02:25:26,920 --> 02:25:28,480
I don't read any.
That's why you get depressed.

3570
02:25:28,510 --> 02:25:28,890
No,
I don't.

3571
02:25:28,890 --> 02:25:31,810
I don't read comments for you.
I don't either.

3572
02:25:31,870 --> 02:25:33,850
I don't need someone telling me I sound
fat.

3573
02:25:36,390 --> 02:25:39,310
Oh,
where can people see you working?

3574
02:25:39,350 --> 02:25:40,770
They get in touch with you.

Anything to say before we leave?
No.

All right.
