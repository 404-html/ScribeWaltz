1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,940
But in my brain I had
to stop and start over.

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:05,443
Okay.

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:11,010
[inaudible]

4
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,260
wants to sound rises.

5
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,610
Drugs this out to clear meal

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:28,741
push.

7
00:00:28,741 --> 00:00:30,960
Come to shove and throw
some money on the table.

8
00:00:30,961 --> 00:00:33,990
Cover last time stuff and
got the soul of a hall.

9
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,480
Got the hot of a loan,

10
00:00:35,481 --> 00:00:36,314
the man

11
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:39,631
fucking thing.

12
00:00:39,631 --> 00:00:42,380
So but best that I can

13
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:45,880
just lack of nail them to the slaughter.

14
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,780
The hose to the bottom
of the walnut drank.

15
00:00:48,781 --> 00:00:49,614
It is

16
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,910
scared little ball with a real live one.

17
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,400
Hell of a man.

18
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,000
Fall in love in a Java.

19
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:00,123
Strangers.

20
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,420
These the average things love up in the
heavens but here on earth he must've

21
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,320
lost Ark Badge.

22
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,960
High Bleed again.

23
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:16,711
Still out.

24
00:01:16,711 --> 00:01:21,711
Same to see if someone had seen him
be get Kyle [inaudible] with them.

25
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:25,330
Skate Amnon that you bought off.

26
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,570
You got the mind of a lap.

27
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,350
The solo solar archer

28
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,030
breaking down and that's Trulia unfolds

29
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,070
fighting for survival and sacrificial.

30
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,960
Rare new raffle gurus.

31
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:43,980
Government issue.

32
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,150
Harmful of stone got a knob
that's about fatigue and

33
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,500
fucking posting up on Twitter's gone.

34
00:01:52,501 --> 00:01:52,891
Sweet.

35
00:01:52,891 --> 00:01:53,724
My name

36
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,450
cause the owl gone stupid.

37
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,830
The Owl Guy Lazy.

38
00:01:59,010 --> 00:01:59,880
It was spiraling.

39
00:01:59,881 --> 00:02:03,540
Bernie in the idolized
crazy Mattawan go to heaven,

40
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:05,380
but everyone's afraid to die.

41
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,430
If God is real borough religions out,

42
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:11,264
just one

43
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,510
boss said lower sandwiches,

44
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:17,820
higher body.

45
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:18,870
You got to [inaudible].

46
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:19,400
You

47
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,860
said one big fight.

48
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,760
Aw Man.

49
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,321
That's your really,

50
00:02:29,321 --> 00:02:30,154

51
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:30,531
No,

52
00:02:30,531 --> 00:02:31,071
that was great.

53
00:02:31,071 --> 00:02:31,740
Terrible.

54
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,140
No,

55
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,050
it was a real moment,

56
00:02:33,051 --> 00:02:33,650
man.

57
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:33,771
No,

58
00:02:33,771 --> 00:02:35,360
I let my mind get away
from me on that one.

59
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,310
That's one I shouldn't answer the phone.

60
00:02:37,311 --> 00:02:37,810
I was gonna lose.
