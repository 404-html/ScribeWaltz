1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:04,900
Her low freak bitches.
So dice is such a maniac.

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:08,230
He makes this album when he's selling 
out Madison Square Garden,

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:13,390
he's selling out the Nassau Coliseum.
He sell him out Gi and places like,

4
00:00:13,391 --> 00:00:16,480
I think to this day it's like Kevin Hart
and him.

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:17,613
I like the biggest as far as like the 
most successful John Kevin Hart's done 

6
00:00:20,951 --> 00:00:23,320
like 60,000
seat places and say,

7
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,220
yeah,
I mean he's,

8
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,580
he's,
what's the new word?

9
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,580
Philly.
It was like 60,000

10
00:00:27,581 --> 00:00:29,530
pounds of trailer for it out.
Now what's next?

11
00:00:29,531 --> 00:00:30,640
It's a,
it's insane.

12
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,200
I mean,
he's a insane,

13
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,640
literally.
And I said,

14
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,533
I think I told you before his,
his phone bill or electric bill at one 

15
00:00:36,191 --> 00:00:38,260
point was in my name because he was so 
like,

16
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:39,370
he asked me if I could put it,
my name's to,

17
00:00:39,371 --> 00:00:41,200
we're going to turn the electricity off.
Wow.

18
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:42,640
I can fill it.
That's crazy.

19
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:44,320
Holy Shit.
Yeah,

20
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,730
like nuts where he's at now.

21
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,800
Wow,
that's crazy.

22
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:48,933
It's great.
My Mom's still has no scope of that at 

23
00:00:50,621 --> 00:00:51,580
all.
Shook.

24
00:00:51,581 --> 00:00:52,540
You're out in la.
She goes,

25
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:53,590
tell Kev we said,
whoa.

26
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,790
I'm like,
I'm probably going to see him.

27
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:58,210
He's probably in Bulgaria doing a 
fucking covered by body guards.

28
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,940
Yeah,
riding on a wave of diamonds,

29
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:05,890
wearing his own sneakers.
I had a genuine a bomb out.

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,920
Like I felt bad about it too and it was 
before,

31
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,870
you know,
I was having a rough go.

32
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,390
I was headlining a the Sacramento Improv
or punchlines second to a punchline,

33
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:17,643
which I love that club and I was 
headlining it and I felt pretty good 

34
00:01:19,421 --> 00:01:20,560
about headlining it.
I'm like,

35
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,530
you know,
seven show week or whatever it is,

36
00:01:23,531 --> 00:01:24,460
but I'm like,
this is great.

37
00:01:24,461 --> 00:01:26,170
I'm headlining the punchline.
Sacramento.

38
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:27,783
Kevin was in town doing the Arco arena 
where the Sacramento Kings play and I'm 

39
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:32,350
like,
all right.

40
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:32,951
He goes,
hey man,

41
00:01:32,951 --> 00:01:35,200
come to the hotel and hang out.
I go,

42
00:01:35,201 --> 00:01:36,034
absolutely.
And I go to the hotel where outside for 

43
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:44,110
a 30 seconds when I get to the hotel,
he's coming out of like the hotel gym.

44
00:01:44,111 --> 00:01:44,944
It's like around the corner and I meet 
him and we're walking to the hotel on 

45
00:01:47,471 --> 00:01:50,870
this like a hundred foot walk.
Car Stopped.

46
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:53,830
People pour out of buildings,
people start yelling and screaming.

47
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,710
He turns around and gives them one way.
If we go into the hotel,

48
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,440
we go up to his suite.
That is amazing.

49
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:01,870
It's got a whole bunch of his boys 
there.

50
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:06,790
They're playing a xbox three 60 the time
it was and he goes,

51
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,320
you went to watch the,
um,

52
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,110
he was doing or watch the intro for my 
special,

53
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,670
my dad was not this one.
It's out now.

54
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:16,090
The one before where he's got the 
pyrotechnics going off.

55
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:16,661
He's like,
yeah,

56
00:02:16,661 --> 00:02:17,494
we got pyro and it's going off.
He showed me this crazy like insane 

57
00:02:21,221 --> 00:02:23,560
trailer for it that's just like mind 
blowing.

58
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,900
And I was feeling so good about,
oh,

59
00:02:27,901 --> 00:02:30,660
I'm sorry.
I should preface this story by saying,

60
00:02:30,661 --> 00:02:31,494
um,
when I was talking to the cab driver 

61
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,200
bringing me to calves hotel,
he was like,

62
00:02:37,201 --> 00:02:39,150
what are you scrolling from a hotel to a
hotel for?

63
00:02:39,151 --> 00:02:40,350
And I go off,
you want to hear the story?

64
00:02:40,351 --> 00:02:40,921
It's pretty,
I said,

65
00:02:40,921 --> 00:02:41,754
Kevin Hart's here and I'm a,
he's all buddy of mine sent me to go 

66
00:02:44,011 --> 00:02:45,630
hang out with them.
And he's like,

67
00:02:45,631 --> 00:02:45,961
yeah,
go.

68
00:02:45,961 --> 00:02:46,621
Yeah,
I'm in town.

69
00:02:46,621 --> 00:02:47,454
I'm a comedian too.
I'm playing the punchline and went and 

70
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,590
he goes,
oh,

71
00:02:49,591 --> 00:02:51,450
that's amazing man,
cause can I get tickets?

72
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,670
And I was like,
yeah,

73
00:02:53,671 --> 00:02:54,504
I could like put you on the list for 
some tickets if you want to say like 

74
00:02:56,501 --> 00:02:57,420
what show you want to come to.

75
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,730
There's like two shows and there or 
something.

76
00:02:58,731 --> 00:03:02,740
He goes to shows at the argo arena.
And I was like,

77
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,090
oh no.
He goes,

78
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:04,923
oh I'm sorry man.
I thought I want to take it to Kevin 

79
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,370
Hart show.
Oh they guy's like,

80
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,510
okay.
He asking you for Kevin Hart's tickets.

81
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:15,460
So that's how that starts.
That's how this thing starts.

82
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,140
And he gives me his card,
this cab driver,

83
00:03:17,141 --> 00:03:17,974
he goes,
call me when you're done cause I'll be 

84
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,530
right in the area.
Okay.

85
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,740
I go up.
So Kev showing me the pyrotechnics,

86
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,960
if it was easy,
you went lobster,

87
00:03:25,961 --> 00:03:28,780
we're all getting lobsters and shit.
I'm not even exaggerating.

88
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:31,120
It's like this kind of hang and I'm 
like,

89
00:03:31,121 --> 00:03:33,730
this is fucking crazy.
And,

90
00:03:33,731 --> 00:03:36,040
uh,
and his buddies are all playing the xbox

91
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:36,874
and I said,
try to find some like sign of like old 

92
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:40,750
Kevin there,
you know what I mean?

93
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,381
Not,
not that he's,

94
00:03:41,381 --> 00:03:43,990
he hasn't personalities,
not shitty or anything.

95
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,071
Just like,
you know,

96
00:03:45,071 --> 00:03:47,950
connect on some level of what our 
friendship is.

97
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,383
I'm like,
you still bring your xbox everywhere 

98
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:51,730
highs.
I still do that too.

99
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:52,564
I pack it up in a like Schlep it with me
everywhere I go so I could do something 

100
00:03:55,691 --> 00:03:57,130
during the day.
And he goes,

101
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,560
oh no man,
because every time we land we send a guy

102
00:03:59,561 --> 00:04:03,760
out to buy an xbox for the day and then 
we leave it for the maids.

103
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,253
And I was like,
I gotta go and I left like in a weird 

104
00:04:08,741 --> 00:04:09,574
short amount of time and the guy picks 
me up in the cab and we're driving back 

105
00:04:12,821 --> 00:04:15,250
to my hotel and he's scans me these 
questions like,

106
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:17,680
how was it man?
How was it was fine.

107
00:04:17,681 --> 00:04:18,514
I'm like,
I wasn't that when like a contest to 

108
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:21,100
meet him.

109
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,900
Like I know and he's like,
Oh man,

110
00:04:22,901 --> 00:04:24,700
he's so funny.
It's craig goes by the way,

111
00:04:24,701 --> 00:04:26,860
cause I feel like a dick.
Um,

112
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,510
I'd love to,
if to offer stop.

113
00:04:28,511 --> 00:04:31,030
I'd love to come to one of your shows 
this weekend.

114
00:04:31,031 --> 00:04:32,200
I go,
yeah man,

115
00:04:32,201 --> 00:04:33,250
absolutely.
Let me know.

116
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,350
He's like,
my wife would love it man.

117
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:37,060
He goes,
I'll bring her out because I look really

118
00:04:37,061 --> 00:04:37,571
cool.
I'll be like,

119
00:04:37,571 --> 00:04:38,404
hey,
I know the comedian stuff and I'll be 

120
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:39,970
like,
yeah man,

121
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:41,810
whatever you want.
So I go,

122
00:04:41,811 --> 00:04:43,030
it's just stop before we got out of the 
car,

123
00:04:43,031 --> 00:04:45,670
just tell me what show which surely you 
want to go to.

124
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:50,260
And we pull up to the hotel like,
you know,

125
00:04:50,261 --> 00:04:53,380
it's kind of a quiet 15 minutes ride and
I'm getting ready to go.

126
00:04:53,381 --> 00:04:54,580
So hey buddy,
what's your name?

127
00:04:54,581 --> 00:04:55,840
So I'll put you in for tickets.
He goes,

128
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,610
honestly man,
I'm not going to come.

129
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,690
Why do you keep building me up to hurt 
my feelings?

130
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,850
What the fuck man,
I'm going out of his way.

131
00:05:06,851 --> 00:05:07,990
Yeah,
that was like the saddest.

132
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,900
I was headlining the punchline.
I was excited.

133
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:10,990
I was,
and then all of a sudden I was like,

134
00:05:10,991 --> 00:05:11,830
Jesus,
man,

135
00:05:11,831 --> 00:05:12,664
I I the call,
like I've made phone calls back home 

136
00:05:14,141 --> 00:05:18,250
like why am I so like just fucking 
awfully green with envy.

137
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,450
I just showed it all over my ass in that
room.

138
00:05:20,451 --> 00:05:21,284
It's tough.
Well,

139
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:22,563
first of all,
that cab driver wasn't helping anything 

140
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:25,390
that kind of put you in a weird state of
mind.

141
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:27,520
He was an idiot.
So you went,

142
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,593
you went to Kevin's place,
you were driven her out by an idiot and 

143
00:05:30,881 --> 00:05:33,460
you're going to see the most successful 
comedian of all time.

144
00:05:33,461 --> 00:05:35,140
Yeah.
Who is your friend who you helped with?

145
00:05:35,141 --> 00:05:35,974
His electrical bill and you get in there
and they're throwing away xbox just to 

146
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,493
meet lobsters.

147
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,930
I got assume you're a high as fuck,
right?

148
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,990
Will you hide when you went over there?
I maybe had to be there.

149
00:05:46,991 --> 00:05:48,450
Those guys aren't really doing anything 
like that.

150
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,750
But you probably did before you went 
over there for sure.

151
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:51,584
Right?
I know I would.

152
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,290
Yeah.
That scared the fuck out of me.

153
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,060
I'd be like,
ah,

154
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,790
it's too rich.
I got to get away from him.

155
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,430
Sorry.
I said a meltdown,

156
00:05:58,431 --> 00:05:59,110
I'm like,
hey,

157
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,560
they go,
well,

158
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,870
you know,
[inaudible] I don't understand how a guy

159
00:06:02,871 --> 00:06:05,450
like that can work as much as he does.
Um,

160
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,740
being meaning,
I don't know.

161
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,570
Not that I don't understand that he's at
ambitious.

162
00:06:08,571 --> 00:06:10,850
I don't understand where the time comes 
from.

163
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,730
I mean,
it's several movies I think still coming

164
00:06:13,731 --> 00:06:14,151
out.
Well,

165
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:16,940
it's a,
it's also stand up and it's also,

166
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:18,540
I mean,
he's just on top of it.

167
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:21,980
Social media is,
social media is like a business to him.

168
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,750
Yeah.
It's a really interesting guy,

169
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:24,980
man.
Like super,

170
00:06:24,981 --> 00:06:26,210
super ambitious.
Well,

171
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:26,841
the new,
uh,

172
00:06:26,841 --> 00:06:31,550
the new trailer for the,
for the new special says he goes,

173
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,890
uh,
comedy's first ever.

174
00:06:33,891 --> 00:06:37,150
Mogul and gas sort of.
I guess so.

175
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,030
I mean,
for sure.

176
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,020
Well,
whatever,

177
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,980
who gives a fuck about first ever this 
or that he's about to say,

178
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:42,823
but as a mom,
what other comedian was a mogul you 

179
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:49,570
think was a real,
like Jerry Seinfeld running a business?

180
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,960
The branch.
I mean,

181
00:06:50,961 --> 00:06:52,750
Kevin's got sneakers.
Does he?

182
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,850
He's cool.
I didn't know Scott.

183
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,070
Nike sneakers.
Yeah.

184
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,793
Okay.
