1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,640
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:01,970
Look,

3
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:04,280
I live with the fact that
there's some people that,

4
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:04,830
ah,

5
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:05,750
of what I do.

6
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,040
And then there are some people like,

7
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:08,360
I'm fucking baffled.

8
00:00:08,361 --> 00:00:10,070
Why is this mother fucker still here?

9
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:11,121
So I get,

10
00:00:11,121 --> 00:00:12,490
and I get like a,

11
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:13,610
I get that,

12
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:15,800
love it or leave it or love it or hate it.

13
00:00:15,801 --> 00:00:16,221
Really.

14
00:00:16,221 --> 00:00:16,491
I mean,

15
00:00:16,491 --> 00:00:19,060
I'll take love it or leave it
because that's a perfect example.

16
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,950
What you just use those a great example.

17
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,160
What's special about this whole
thing is that a guy like you,

18
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,750
like you saying that,

19
00:00:26,751 --> 00:00:27,050
uh,

20
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:27,411
you know,

21
00:00:27,411 --> 00:00:27,670
uh,

22
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,540
that you're a love it or leave a guy.

23
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:30,650
But if you weren't,

24
00:00:30,651 --> 00:00:32,270
you [inaudible] look,

25
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:35,320
if you weren't a guy who has his
podcast sponsored by the flesh,

26
00:00:35,321 --> 00:00:35,601
slide,

27
00:00:35,601 --> 00:00:39,610
a guy who puts out a podcast
in the Internet way before
anybody and a guy whose

28
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,420
most recent movie you just said,

29
00:00:41,421 --> 00:00:42,770
come off kind of fuck everybody.

30
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:43,910
I'm just going to do this on my own.

31
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:44,940
Do it written,

32
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,160
release it my way.

33
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,600
Fuck the entire system of it.

34
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:50,420
A guy like you really
wouldn't exist any other way.

35
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:50,870
No.

36
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:51,703
You know,

37
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,501
it's kind of,

38
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:53,101
you've got to go.

39
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:54,680
You're the ultimate love it or leave your,

40
00:00:54,681 --> 00:00:56,030
you're doing it your way.

41
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,260
Play it with passion.

42
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,380
Here's my philosophy and how
does everybody's philosophy?

43
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,610
It's not even an original one.

44
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:02,991
One life.

45
00:01:02,991 --> 00:01:03,860
You fucking die.

46
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,460
That's it.

47
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,800
And you don't know
what's on the other side.

48
00:01:06,801 --> 00:01:08,390
And we hope for this,

49
00:01:08,391 --> 00:01:09,770
that we hope for Candyland.

50
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:10,301
Well,

51
00:01:10,301 --> 00:01:10,841
we don't know.

52
00:01:10,841 --> 00:01:13,810
It could be as simple as getting a
box and stay there for all the fucking

53
00:01:13,811 --> 00:01:14,531
attorney you had.

54
00:01:14,531 --> 00:01:15,041
Your shot,

55
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:15,701
your computer,

56
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:17,350
we shut you down and you're finished.

57
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,450
So if that's the case,

58
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,063
it,

59
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:25,120
it behooves you to shoot
for your dreams every time.

60
00:01:25,121 --> 00:01:27,250
I know it sounds a little
dopey and Tony Robbins this,

61
00:01:27,251 --> 00:01:28,210
but it's real.

62
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:28,811
It's real.

63
00:01:28,811 --> 00:01:31,060
Like in a world where
you're going to fucking die.

64
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:35,770
Like this is the way I think about it
and that it's an example that's a real

65
00:01:35,771 --> 00:01:36,371
close to home.

66
00:01:36,371 --> 00:01:37,720
My old man was a good dude,

67
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:38,411
my father,

68
00:01:38,411 --> 00:01:39,090
good guy.

69
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,480
Not many good men in the world.

70
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,840
This was a good fucking guy did worked
at a post office cancel and you're

71
00:01:46,121 --> 00:01:47,200
fucking stamp.

72
00:01:47,201 --> 00:01:48,190
What a soul killing,

73
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:51,940
horrible job that is for years
just to pay for a fucking family.

74
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:53,860
Who knew if he had dreams.

75
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,260
Maybe his only dream was to like,

76
00:01:55,261 --> 00:01:55,340
oh,

77
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,980
I'll get married and have kids work.

78
00:01:56,981 --> 00:01:58,210
Maybe it wasn't a big deal to him.

79
00:01:58,211 --> 00:02:01,270
And he did whatever he had to put
food on the table and stuff like that.

80
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:01,871
Good Dude.

81
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:04,000
Take me to matinees every Wednesday.

82
00:02:04,001 --> 00:02:04,601
Go see a movie,

83
00:02:04,601 --> 00:02:05,830
take mass school half day,

84
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,600
go see flicks and whatnot.

85
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:08,170
Uh,

86
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,003
never know.

87
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,300
We're not one of these parents,

88
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:10,660
you know,

89
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,940
fucks around with a kid or something
like that where you're like,

90
00:02:12,941 --> 00:02:13,091
oh,

91
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,910
he was all good except there
was that good straight arrow.

92
00:02:15,911 --> 00:02:20,140
Fucking dude didn't went to church because
his wife made him but wasn't big into

93
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:20,974
the church.

94
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:23,800
Fucking mode has mother-in-law's
lawn all the time.

95
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:24,550
Good guy.

96
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,031
Good guy.

97
00:02:25,031 --> 00:02:27,310
Raise three good kids or at
least two good kids in me.

98
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,470
And so my father,

99
00:02:29,471 --> 00:02:30,910
we'd go out to eat one night,

100
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:31,720
uh,

101
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,890
he's best 68 years old.

102
00:02:32,891 --> 00:02:35,290
We'd go out to eat and
Morton's in Philadelphia,

103
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:35,920
uh,

104
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,720
and is one of those special nights.

105
00:02:37,721 --> 00:02:40,120
Man was like the old family
winds up being the same place.

106
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,650
Hadn't been that way in years.

107
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:42,461
My Mom,

108
00:02:42,461 --> 00:02:43,294
my dad,

109
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,040
me and my wife's with me,

110
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:45,430
uh,

111
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:48,640
my sister and her husband and she lives
out in at this point I think she was

112
00:02:48,641 --> 00:02:49,301
living in Kobe,

113
00:02:49,301 --> 00:02:50,380
Japan or something like that.

114
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,050
So she's rarely back in
the states and my brother,

115
00:02:53,051 --> 00:02:53,920
he's married to do,

116
00:02:53,921 --> 00:02:55,360
but his husband wasn't with us.

117
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,770
I didn't make the trip that time.

118
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:57,700
Unfortunately.

119
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,710
There we are in a back room at Morton's,

120
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:00,110
you know,

121
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:04,760
an Eaton having a great time chit chat
and he'll mass putting away steak.

122
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,473
Cheesecake is,

123
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,480
I have a couple of Manhattans.

124
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:08,620
That was his fucking poison.

125
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:09,850
And you could tell,

126
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,160
and I don't even like
paint this in retrospect,

127
00:03:12,161 --> 00:03:13,210
it was clear on the night,

128
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,660
parents love seeing their
kids all in one place.

129
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,171
Happy,

130
00:03:17,171 --> 00:03:17,681
healthy,

131
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:19,540
not fucked in the head
or something like that.

132
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,070
And you could tell he was enjoying it.

133
00:03:21,071 --> 00:03:21,431
There were,

134
00:03:21,431 --> 00:03:22,660
as kids shooting shit,

135
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,430
everyone's trying to make
each other laugh at shit,

136
00:03:24,431 --> 00:03:25,450
trying to make him laugh.

137
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,000
He,

138
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,400
everyone's,

139
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,670
since everyone's paying attention,

140
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:28,271
everyone else,

141
00:03:28,271 --> 00:03:31,480
maybe nobody's paying attention to him
meet and maybe too much cheesecake that

142
00:03:31,481 --> 00:03:31,721
night,

143
00:03:31,721 --> 00:03:32,201
but fuck it,

144
00:03:32,201 --> 00:03:33,310
we're all having a good time.

145
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:34,900
Put them in a cab that,

146
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:36,700
and I kiss him on the head as like,

147
00:03:36,701 --> 00:03:37,720
hey mousy in the morning.

148
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:42,220
And he'd come out to Philadelphia to
see me do Q and a at the wizard comicon,

149
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:44,410
Philadelphia wizard comic come off,

150
00:03:44,411 --> 00:03:45,280
he goes in the cab,

151
00:03:45,281 --> 00:03:46,810
go home and I go to the hotel,

152
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:47,321
go to sleep.

153
00:03:47,321 --> 00:03:50,740
I get a phone call at six in the morning
from my brother and my brother's like,

154
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:51,040
um,

155
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,600
you got to get down to
the hospital in Walnut.

156
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:53,621
And I said,

157
00:03:53,621 --> 00:03:53,861
why?

158
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:54,101
He goes,

159
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:54,520
dad.

160
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,290
And now my father was in
and out of poor health,

161
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,670
who's diabetic and whatnot.

162
00:03:57,671 --> 00:03:59,290
He'd had like strokes,

163
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,090
heart attacks and stuff like that.

164
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:01,470
He,

165
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:01,751
yeah,

166
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:03,250
he was bad health dude.

167
00:04:03,251 --> 00:04:04,084
But um,

168
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,910
but not so when my brother's
like dad's in the hospital,

169
00:04:06,911 --> 00:04:07,630
I'm like,

170
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,051
okay,

171
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:11,020
what now fucking throw
a rock and dad's got it.

172
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:11,921
And my brother,

173
00:04:11,921 --> 00:04:12,790
you could hear it in his voice.

174
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:13,271
He was just like,

175
00:04:13,271 --> 00:04:14,500
you got to get down here right now.

176
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,423
And I was,

177
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,391
oh shit.

178
00:04:16,391 --> 00:04:17,350
And I hung up,

179
00:04:17,351 --> 00:04:17,921
got dressed,

180
00:04:17,921 --> 00:04:18,754
went down.

181
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:21,010
I've get to the emergency room,

182
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:21,940
open the door.

183
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:26,970
First thing I see is my mother who
looks more scared than I've ever seen,

184
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,270
a human being in my life.

185
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,980
Fucking terror on her face.

186
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:30,814
Not,

187
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,040
I've seen my mother cry in my lifetime.

188
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:33,191
You know,

189
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:35,080
I've made my mother cry in my lifetime.

190
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:38,500
I've watched her cry watching fucking
Falcon Crest when I was a kid.

191
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:39,700
This was different.

192
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,020
This was like terror,

193
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,153
fear.

194
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:42,700
Uh,

195
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,001
you know,

196
00:04:43,001 --> 00:04:47,020
almost like there was a fucking gun
to her head and off of her face.

197
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:50,080
I looked in my brother and my brother
just has this expression where you just

198
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,490
kind of gives me the slow nod,

199
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:52,324
which is,

200
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,440
he's gone,

201
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:53,711
you know,

202
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:56,590
my father was dead and I went in
and I saw him on a Gurney and shit,

203
00:04:56,591 --> 00:04:57,850
and it was so strange.

204
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,890
And I go outside and I was a smoker,

205
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:00,770
like cigarette smoke room.

206
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,770
Those days I was going
to have a cigarette and,

207
00:05:02,771 --> 00:05:03,040
uh,

208
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,560
Donald comes out and I was like,

209
00:05:05,561 --> 00:05:05,770
uh,

210
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:06,530
oh,

211
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:07,090
uh,

212
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,590
this is a shock and whatever,

213
00:05:08,591 --> 00:05:08,831
you know,

214
00:05:08,831 --> 00:05:09,910
we're upset and stuff.

215
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,051
And uh,

216
00:05:11,051 --> 00:05:11,471
I said,

217
00:05:11,471 --> 00:05:13,210
how was it because he was there.

218
00:05:13,211 --> 00:05:13,451
I said,

219
00:05:13,451 --> 00:05:14,051
what happened?

220
00:05:14,051 --> 00:05:15,790
And Donald tells me the story of like,

221
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:19,210
a dad woke up and had
this like big reaction,

222
00:05:19,211 --> 00:05:19,931
like just like,

223
00:05:19,931 --> 00:05:20,431
I'm hot,

224
00:05:20,431 --> 00:05:21,010
I'm hot under his,

225
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:23,370
thrown the sheets off
and mom freak touches.

226
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:23,471
Like,

227
00:05:23,471 --> 00:05:23,951
what's the matter?

228
00:05:23,951 --> 00:05:24,371
What's the matter?

229
00:05:24,371 --> 00:05:25,290
She told Donald Call,

230
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,140
I'd call the ambulance,

231
00:05:26,141 --> 00:05:26,974
call the hospital,

232
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,350
and he was gone within seconds.

233
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,370
So that's a,

234
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:31,900
you know,

235
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,733
bad enough,

236
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,101
you know,

237
00:05:33,101 --> 00:05:34,420
he was hot and uncomfortable.

238
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:35,290
You don't want to hear like,

239
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:35,411
oh,

240
00:05:35,411 --> 00:05:37,660
he died in his sleep and we
woke up and he just didn't.

241
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,370
But then my brother says,

242
00:05:39,371 --> 00:05:41,020
this thing probably defined my life.

243
00:05:41,021 --> 00:05:41,950
My brother goes,

244
00:05:41,951 --> 00:05:42,784
uh,

245
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,850
he died screaming and I go,

246
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:46,521
what,

247
00:05:46,521 --> 00:05:47,170
what?

248
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:47,681
And he goes,

249
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:47,980
he,

250
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,120
he died screaming.

251
00:05:49,121 --> 00:05:49,631
And I was like,

252
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:50,950
w I mean as,

253
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,300
is that a figure of speech?

254
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:53,080
And he goes,

255
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,261
no,

256
00:05:53,261 --> 00:05:53,891
he literally,

257
00:05:53,891 --> 00:05:54,880
he died screaming.

258
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:59,910
And you could see my brother was haunted
by it and my father wasn't like a,

259
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,180
I wouldn't say he was a
butch man or strong man,

260
00:06:02,181 --> 00:06:04,790
but he wasn't the soft men money
stretch to the imagination.

261
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:08,270
And I never heard him get real
loud or anything like that.

262
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:10,070
And the notion of my father dying,

263
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:12,680
screaming changed my
life because I was like,

264
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,480
even a good man in this world.

265
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,620
You play the game,

266
00:06:15,621 --> 00:06:16,550
you play it straight,

267
00:06:16,551 --> 00:06:17,750
you play by the rules,

268
00:06:17,751 --> 00:06:19,160
you do everything you're supposed to,

269
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,510
you're going to die screaming.

270
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:21,620
And at that point I was like,

271
00:06:21,621 --> 00:06:26,621
there's no point in not trying to
accomplish every stupid fucking dream I've

272
00:06:26,931 --> 00:06:27,170
got.

273
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,910
Even if it's dumb shit,

274
00:06:28,911 --> 00:06:29,601
like fucking,

275
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:29,871
you know,

276
00:06:29,871 --> 00:06:30,704
Oh my God,

277
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,120
I've always wanted to collect this money.

278
00:06:32,121 --> 00:06:34,400
Fucking a Wayne Gretzky
cards in one fucking binder.

279
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:37,750
Or if it's like I want to make a movie
or if it's like I want to put on podcasts

280
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,190
or I want to do a TV show
now I want to write a book,

281
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,690
chase it all down.

282
00:06:41,691 --> 00:06:44,030
Chasing whimsy is what I've been
doing for the last few years,

283
00:06:44,031 --> 00:06:44,781
just smoking weed.

284
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:47,900
And chances went whimsies
anytime I'm like back in the day,

285
00:06:47,901 --> 00:06:48,734
I'd have a good idea,

286
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,450
something I really wanted
to follow through on it.

287
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:50,871
And they'll say,

288
00:06:50,871 --> 00:06:51,591
you can get scared.

289
00:06:51,591 --> 00:06:54,620
You start thinking about some about some
of the fucker's gonna say and be like,

290
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:54,831
oh,

291
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:55,431
it's stupid.

292
00:06:55,431 --> 00:06:56,630
Why would you fucking do that?

293
00:06:56,631 --> 00:06:57,470
And fucking why?

294
00:06:57,471 --> 00:06:57,831
Why?

295
00:06:57,831 --> 00:06:59,180
A lot of why people in this world,

296
00:06:59,181 --> 00:07:01,370
I try to surround myself
with the why nots,

297
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:01,990
motherfucker sir.

298
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,510
You're like,

299
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,201
I want to try this.

300
00:07:03,201 --> 00:07:04,070
Like why not?

301
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:04,521
Let's go,

302
00:07:04,521 --> 00:07:05,301
let's give it a shot.

303
00:07:05,301 --> 00:07:06,200
You gotta be game man.

304
00:07:06,201 --> 00:07:07,850
People help you achieve
your dreams and shit.

305
00:07:07,851 --> 00:07:09,110
So for me,

306
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,670
the last few years I've just been trying
to accomplish every dopey dream to big

307
00:07:13,671 --> 00:07:14,031
shit.

308
00:07:14,031 --> 00:07:15,440
The little shit you got to do them all.

309
00:07:15,441 --> 00:07:17,840
You can't just do the
climb every mountain shit.

310
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,250
You know,

311
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,970
he did sometimes late at bar down,

312
00:07:19,971 --> 00:07:20,960
step over it and be like,

313
00:07:20,961 --> 00:07:21,221
tonight,

314
00:07:21,221 --> 00:07:21,560
Hasa,

315
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,520
you feel accomplished,

316
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:26,120
but chase it all and do it all
because we're all gonna die screaming.

317
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,850
And you might as well enjoy it here and I,

318
00:07:28,851 --> 00:07:32,180
and when I say chase all don't fucking
do it at the expense of someone else.

319
00:07:32,181 --> 00:07:33,560
Obviously don't hurt somebody else,

320
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,840
but go after your James Man.

321
00:07:35,841 --> 00:07:36,860
If your dream is to like,

322
00:07:36,861 --> 00:07:38,240
I want to kill 12 children.

323
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,130
I'm not saying I'm not talking to you,

324
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:42,650
but go after your dreams of
not going to hurt anybody.

325
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:50,330
[inaudible].
