1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,980
Agents are going to get paranoid
when that thing's in here.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,210
Oh Dude.

3
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:04,020
It'll scare you.

4
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:04,480
Just

5
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,021
I believe it.

6
00:00:05,021 --> 00:00:05,261
I know.

7
00:00:05,261 --> 00:00:05,561
I know.

8
00:00:05,561 --> 00:00:06,190
The Wolf.

9
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:06,881
Fucking yellow.

10
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:07,421
God Damn.

11
00:00:07,421 --> 00:00:08,540
Eyes that fucking national.

12
00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:09,374
Yeah,

13
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,413
it blanked.

14
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:11,470
It blanked out.

15
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:12,170
Oh God.

16
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:13,003
Let me just see.

17
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,570
We're now joined on stream.

18
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:17,400
Oh,

19
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,280
powerful stream.

20
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:20,320
That's a full live version.

21
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,620
Full size version of this.

22
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,990
God Damn Christ that things.

23
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,770
That was an awesome movie,

24
00:00:26,771 --> 00:00:27,041
folks.

25
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:27,880
If you haven't seen it,

26
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:28,780
how dare you.

27
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:32,230
If you haven't seen American Werewolf in
London is the greatest horror movie of

28
00:00:32,231 --> 00:00:32,830
all time.

29
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,210
I love that fucking moving.

30
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,230
I used to think that,

31
00:00:35,231 --> 00:00:37,510
but then I saw the worst
horror movie of all time.

32
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,190
What was that funny games?

33
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:40,863
What is that?

34
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:41,201
Oh,

35
00:00:41,201 --> 00:00:41,900
that's the one you were,

36
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:42,201
yeah.

37
00:00:42,201 --> 00:00:43,190
It's just the,

38
00:00:43,191 --> 00:00:45,380
the director said the
appropriate response.

39
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:47,200
Do it as walking out halfway through.

40
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:47,381
Well,

41
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:50,290
this is a human created violence.

42
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:51,041
Scary movie,

43
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:51,874
right?

44
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:52,441
Yeah.

45
00:00:52,441 --> 00:00:52,831
It's just,

46
00:00:52,831 --> 00:00:53,280
it's a heart.

47
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:53,521
It's a,

48
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:54,790
it's like the I've seen,

49
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,550
but it's almost every harm,

50
00:00:56,551 --> 00:00:57,660
but it's not monsters,

51
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:58,763
right?

52
00:00:58,950 --> 00:00:59,230
Yeah.

53
00:00:59,230 --> 00:00:59,870
No,

54
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:00,510
it's human.

55
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:00,751
No,

56
00:01:00,751 --> 00:01:01,680
it's not werewolves.

57
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,270
See I'm not interested
in like mean people.

58
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:08,400
I like watching a good werewolf movie
or some shit or a vampire movie.

59
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:10,090
I like watching nonsense.

60
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:14,170
Like you showing me like some guy's gonna
kill somebody with a pair of pliers.

61
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,760
I really don't need to see that.

62
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,380
I know there's guys that'll do that.

63
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:18,420
Oh No,

64
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:18,590
no,

65
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:19,020
no.

66
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,350
This is not even like that.

67
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,400
This isn't like some slash reflect.

68
00:01:22,401 --> 00:01:22,850
Dude.

69
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,030
This is like a,

70
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,831
according to the director,

71
00:01:24,831 --> 00:01:28,730
it's commentary on the infiltration of
like the mainstream media end of popular

72
00:01:28,731 --> 00:01:32,480
life and they're using this like
story to like to articulate it.

73
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,710
It's deep.

74
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,450
It's fucking deep.

75
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:36,950
It's about fascism.

76
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:37,551
But man,

77
00:01:37,551 --> 00:01:38,450
it is like your,

78
00:01:38,451 --> 00:01:41,600
your stomach will roll when
you watch this fucking thing.

79
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,680
Highly recommended.

80
00:01:42,681 --> 00:01:42,921
They say,

81
00:01:42,921 --> 00:01:44,420
I only saw the US version.

82
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,580
Some people say that the u s version,

83
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,500
it's a shot for shot.

84
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:49,850
It's shot for fucking shot.

85
00:01:49,851 --> 00:01:51,410
It's the guy from reservoir dogs.

86
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,431
What's his name?

87
00:01:52,431 --> 00:01:53,300
The fucking um,

88
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,220
undercover cop from reservoir dogs.

89
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:55,971
Yeah.

90
00:01:55,971 --> 00:01:57,080
Tim Roth is in it.

91
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,030
He fucking nails it.

92
00:01:59,031 --> 00:01:59,331

93
00:01:59,331 --> 00:01:59,571

00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:03,800
what's that guy do?

98
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,940
Does he do like planning on
it seems like it probably was,

99
00:02:06,941 --> 00:02:07,380
you know,

100
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,030

he's a bad ass mother fucking actor dude.

103
00:02:11,781 --> 00:02:12,830
You know what I did last night,

104
00:02:12,831 --> 00:02:13,011
man,

105
00:02:13,011 --> 00:02:16,310
I went to this movie theater that
fucking Quintin Tarantino owns,

106
00:02:16,311 --> 00:02:21,311
called the new Beverly and they show
grindhouse flicks twice a month and last

107
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,920
night they were showing a
anti drug grindhouse flit cod.

108
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,920
Like the acid strip or something.

109
00:02:27,921 --> 00:02:29,780
What exactly is grindhouse mean?

110
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,590
I don't know.

111
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:30,861
I was,

112
00:02:30,861 --> 00:02:32,020
I was trying to talk,

113
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,350
I want to Google that,

114
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,213
but I don't know.

115
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:34,541
Yeah,

116
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:35,830
I always wondered when I saw that,

117
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,990
when I saw that he was doing those movies,

118
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:38,620
the one,

119
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:38,920
uh,

120
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,320

121
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,153
uh,

122
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,480
was a pretty girl from charmed.

123
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,413
The fuck is man.

124
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,533
I Dunno.

125
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:48,450
There was what?

126
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,190
They were all pretty in that show charm.

127
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,500
It's just fucking awesome man.

128
00:02:51,501 --> 00:02:52,041
Cause it's like,

129
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:52,281
you know,

130
00:02:52,281 --> 00:02:53,900
it's like the original fucking,

131
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,460
it's the original movie,

132
00:02:55,461 --> 00:02:56,780
so it's kind of fucked up.

133
00:02:56,781 --> 00:02:58,130
This had bud cort in it.

134
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,240
It was shot in Italy.

135
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:00,760
Yeah,

136
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,593
yeah.

137
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,093
MMM.

138
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,110
Rose McGowan.

139
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:06,973
That's the chick.

140
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,840
She was in it and she was,

141
00:03:08,841 --> 00:03:09,080
uh,

142
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,600
she had like one leg was a
gun or something like that.

143
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:12,170
Oh yeah,

144
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:12,730
I remember.

145
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:13,281
And I was like,

146
00:03:13,281 --> 00:03:15,050
what the fuck is grindhouse like wait,

147
00:03:15,051 --> 00:03:15,580
what is it?

148
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,800
It's just like an old kind of stupid,

149
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:18,634
gory,

150
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,610
weird kind of artistic style.

151
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,870
Like I think they vary.

152
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:25,840
This one was like just the stupidest,

153
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:27,310
funniest thing you've ever seen.

154
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:28,510
Like the way they try to do,

155
00:03:28,511 --> 00:03:33,430
like they were trying to do the anti-drug
message in the 60s and bud cort plays

156
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:35,800
this kind of rampaging hippie Weirdo.

157
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:36,671
Oh,

158
00:03:36,671 --> 00:03:37,031
here's the,

159
00:03:37,031 --> 00:03:42,031
here's the definition of grindhouse
is an American term for a theater that

160
00:03:42,491 --> 00:03:45,100
mainly shows exploitation films.

161
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:49,900
It's named after the defunct burlesque
theater's located on 42nd street in New

162
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:54,520
York City where a bump and grind
dancing and strip tease were featured.

163
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,443
Wow,

164
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,591
that's crazy.

165
00:03:56,591 --> 00:03:57,940
So that was,

166
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,310
that's the old 42nd street.

167
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,710
That's back when New York City like,

168
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:04,780
had like a really fucked up area.

169
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,320
Do you remember what it was like?

170
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:07,630
Did you,

171
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,400
did you ever go to New York
City when it was crazy?

172
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,420
No Way.

173
00:04:10,421 --> 00:04:11,141
I've heard about it,

174
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:12,070
but I never went there.

175
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:12,730
I would,

176
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:13,060
I've been,

177
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,590
I was there many times when it was,

178
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,940
when it was still dangerous.

179
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,310
It was really interesting
that 42nd street was there,

180
00:04:18,311 --> 00:04:20,020
a completely different place.

181
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,183
It was this,

182
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:25,660
they decided they made like this active
decision to clean that fucking place

183
00:04:25,661 --> 00:04:25,960
opposite,

184
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,960
take out all the bullshit and make it
like super like fan friendly and super,

185
00:04:31,241 --> 00:04:31,590
uh,

186
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,290
uh,

187
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:32,800
you know,

188
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,170
a visitor friendly.

189
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:40,490
So w what it used to be was like one
dirty little stripped ts and peep show and

190
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,610
triple x movie and it was
fucking creepy people.

191
00:04:45,611 --> 00:04:47,170
Creepy people hanging out.

192
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:48,290
Like you're like,

193
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,330
let's Google a old photos of,

194
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:51,870
it's like taxi driver.

195
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,340
It's like the movie taxi driver.

196
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,130
That's where I seen,

197
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:54,963
yeah,

198
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:55,680
yeah,

199
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:55,950
that,

200
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:56,990
that I remember that.

201
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:57,740
I remember it was like,

202
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,940
I came to New York

203
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:03,770
a couple of times when I was in my teenage
years and I remember being there and

204
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,110
wandered around called
what a fucking crazy place.

205
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:07,801
This is,

206
00:05:07,801 --> 00:05:08,460
man.

207
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,030
I had family in New Jersey and uh,

208
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:11,560
they had,

209
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,490
they taken me to Manhattan a
few times when I was young.

210
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,230
I remember life,

211
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:16,860
man.

212
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,410
I barely remember it when
I was like a little kid,

213
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,611
barely remember.

214
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,860
But I remember like feeling
it's like dangerous.

215
00:05:22,861 --> 00:05:24,510
Like it's so big and crazy.

216
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:25,853
It is dangerous.

217
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,750
But I remember when I was in my teenage
years is when I saw like the peep shows

218
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,584
and all that shit.

219
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,581
I saw those,

220
00:05:32,581 --> 00:05:32,770
uh,

221
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:32,990
that's,

222
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,890
we came there for a karate tournament.

223
00:05:34,891 --> 00:05:37,770
There was a big karate tournament these
do at Madison Square Garden every year.

224
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:42,870
So we came in and me and a bunch
of fucking soft dorks from Boston,

225
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:43,740
you know,

226
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:48,740
Newton even where I was from the suburbs
of Boston to go to this crazy fucking

227
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:49,561
city.

228
00:05:49,561 --> 00:05:51,990
Like we were essentially
living in Mayberry.

229
00:05:51,991 --> 00:05:53,580
Compare it to like New York City.

230
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,970
So you have your own problems with
like socially with people everywhere.

231
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:57,963
Where I,

232
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,811
where I grew up,

233
00:05:58,811 --> 00:06:00,670
like I went to Newton south high school.

234
00:06:00,671 --> 00:06:02,980
It's like the woman nice
as high schools ever.

235
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,650
You know you're always going to
have problems with human beings.

236
00:06:05,651 --> 00:06:07,780
Whenever he gets 17 year olds
and you mix them all together,

237
00:06:07,781 --> 00:06:08,710
there's going to be progress.

238
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,190
But like very few fights in school,

239
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:15,550
very few like no one got
really seriously injured.

240
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:19,180
You know there was like a few squabbles
and people got upset with people,

241
00:06:19,181 --> 00:06:20,710
but other than that it
was a nice place to live.

242
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,900
I didn't realize how easy
it had it until you're,

243
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,670
you're in Manhattan and
you know and you're like 17
years old and you're like in

244
00:06:27,671 --> 00:06:28,510
time screaming like,

245
00:06:28,511 --> 00:06:30,790
what the fuck is this place?

246
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,710
Like this place is crazy.

247
00:06:32,711 --> 00:06:36,970
It's just one person after another who
wants to fuck you and give you some new

248
00:06:36,971 --> 00:06:37,804
disease?

249
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,550
Like one it just people
looking at fuck people,

250
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,890
people looking at jerk off and people
looking to go sit and watch someone play

251
00:06:44,891 --> 00:06:46,610
with their ass hole in
front of you while you be,

252
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:50,380
but while you beat off in a booth and
then someone cleans that like that was

253
00:06:50,381 --> 00:06:51,214
time square.

254
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,030
Ugh.

255
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:52,930
No one cleans it there.

256
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,921
They did clean it.

257
00:06:53,921 --> 00:06:55,330
They would go in there with a mop man.

258
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:55,960
They would do,

259
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,660
they would go in there with a mop and
they'd look at you like you motherfucker.

260
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:03,030
I told you when I was in San Francisco
I went to one of those places and I

261
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,450
accident like I've never been to the place
where the thing goes up and you're in

262
00:07:06,451 --> 00:07:09,360
like this room and there's just a
bunch of people behind this glass like

263
00:07:09,361 --> 00:07:12,780
fingering themselves and stuff and
accidentally put my hand on the side.

264
00:07:12,781 --> 00:07:13,531
Like go was like a little thing.

265
00:07:13,531 --> 00:07:14,364
It was wet

266
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:16,803
too.

267
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,200
That's not good.

268
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,620
That is not good.

269
00:07:19,621 --> 00:07:20,640
And like the guy who was like,

270
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,061
I was like,

271
00:07:21,061 --> 00:07:22,890
oh I think I just put my
hand and common cause oh no.

272
00:07:22,891 --> 00:07:25,320
We cleaned those things every
in between every person.

273
00:07:25,321 --> 00:07:27,150
And then I just watched people
going in and out and I was like,

274
00:07:27,151 --> 00:07:27,751
no you don't.

275
00:07:27,751 --> 00:07:29,940
And watching people
how you play your hand.

276
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,400
Yeah,

277
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,240
it's just cells.

278
00:07:32,241 --> 00:07:33,320
Don't worry about it man.

279
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:37,580
Cause you had to choose between a guy
punching you in the head or jizzing on

280
00:07:37,581 --> 00:07:38,414
your face.

281
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,081
What would you pick?

282
00:07:39,081 --> 00:07:39,914
Punching in the head?

283
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,570
I would take the gels in the face all day.

284
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:42,571
You know,

285
00:07:42,571 --> 00:07:43,710
why would you do dunk?

286
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,383
You know why?

287
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,230
Because I'll tell you why.

288
00:07:49,231 --> 00:07:49,821
Because A,

289
00:07:49,821 --> 00:07:50,140
I've been

290
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,850
punched in the face and it's not fun.

291
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:52,751
And B,

292
00:07:52,751 --> 00:07:55,150
I've accidentally come in my
face and it was not that bad.

293
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,103
Oh,

294
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,330
it was delicious.

295
00:07:58,331 --> 00:07:58,900
It was,

296
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,231
no,

297
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,064
it wasn't delicious,

298
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,690
but it wasn't nothing that hurt,

299
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:02,621
you know,

300
00:08:02,621 --> 00:08:03,400
it was pretty,

301
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,240
pretty pain free.

302
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,373
It was warm.

303
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,070
You know,

304
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,360
when I was like 16,

305
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,260
I was uh,

306
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,010
you know,

307
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,090
I was completely retarded.

308
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,680
Of course I was using the pullout method.

309
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,290
I might also teenage girlfriend,

310
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,210
we didn't know what the
fuck word and we're idiots.

311
00:08:16,211 --> 00:08:17,290
We shouldn't have been alone together.

312
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,011
So,

313
00:08:18,011 --> 00:08:18,280
uh,

314
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:22,750
I would pull out and one time I pulled
out and I shot it so far and hit me in

315
00:08:22,751 --> 00:08:23,584
the face.

316
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,990
Like I was like looking down
at it as I pulled it out,

317
00:08:25,991 --> 00:08:30,110
I guess I wanted to see how much came
out and it hit me right in the Mug flat

318
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:31,901
and I was like,

319
00:08:31,901 --> 00:08:32,171
wow.

320
00:08:32,171 --> 00:08:33,070
So that's what it feels like.

321
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,360
It was kinda exciting.

322
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:38,900
Put Yourself,

323
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,730
put yourself in the girl's position.

324
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:42,410
It feels like,

325
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,580
why do we want a hot load in the face?

326
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:46,220
It's hot,

327
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:46,480
you know,

328
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,060
like God represents,

329
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,100
represents the man's passion on your face.

330
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,280
Not that I want it from
anyone other than me.

331
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,120
Doesn't sound like it at all.

332
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,060
Oh,

333
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:58,980
it only happened once.

334
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,880
This other things that it only happened
once then I'm shocked with one of them

335
00:09:02,881 --> 00:09:04,040
is um,

336
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,360
beating off in the car.

337
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,290
I've only been off in the car
once in my entire driving.

338
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:10,110
Yeah.

339
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,540
One time when I was living in Boston,

340
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,950
I was working for a Limo Company and uh,

341
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,800
I was driving home and it was
a long ride and it was horny.

342
00:09:16,801 --> 00:09:17,670
So I just beat off.

343
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,170
It was just like something to do and a,

344
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,590
I just squirted a load inside my shirt,

345
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:23,940
tucked it back of my pants.

346
00:09:23,941 --> 00:09:24,330
Yeah.

347
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:24,750
And then,

348
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,051
you know,

349
00:09:25,051 --> 00:09:26,580
I remember doing it and
I remember thinking,

350
00:09:26,581 --> 00:09:27,030
well,

351
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,421
all right,

352
00:09:27,421 --> 00:09:30,690
so here's some new fucked up thing I do
now because I figured I would just keep

353
00:09:30,691 --> 00:09:31,200
doing that.

354
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,440
No,

355
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,250
I'd never jerked off in the car before
and be in like 20 years old or whatever.

356
00:09:35,251 --> 00:09:35,911
I was at the time,

357
00:09:35,911 --> 00:09:36,211
I was like,

358
00:09:36,211 --> 00:09:37,380
what an idiot I did.

359
00:09:37,381 --> 00:09:40,110
You really just start jerking off in the
car because that's what you're going to

360
00:09:40,111 --> 00:09:41,070
start doing all the time now.

361
00:09:41,071 --> 00:09:41,670
Dummy.

362
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,300
And I didn't,

363
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,051
for whatever reason,

364
00:09:43,051 --> 00:09:43,890
I never did it again.

365
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:44,671
Like what do you mean?

366
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:45,930
Like that would become your fetish.

367
00:09:45,931 --> 00:09:46,480
Like jerking.

368
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:46,860
Yeah,

369
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,580
I figured if I found one other place
where I was comfortable jerking off,

370
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,690
that's not a good thing.

371
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:53,091
You know what I mean?

372
00:09:53,091 --> 00:09:54,930
Because have jerked off at work before

373
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:55,421
God.

374
00:09:55,421 --> 00:09:58,120
Imagine a world where jerking
off was just normal and like,

375
00:09:58,121 --> 00:09:58,870
do you just like,

376
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:59,240
you know,

377
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,910
in line people are jerking off.

378
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:05,500
One time I jerked off at work twice
because I this really hot date that night

379
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,790
and I jerked,

380
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:07,750
I was doing construction.

381
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:09,270
I was in his basement that would the,

382
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,150
we're building this house and uh,

383
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,730
I would just open the door,

384
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,680
beat off onto the Dr

385
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,740
and then go back to work.

386
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,910
I did it twice.

387
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:20,530
That's how fucked up I was.

388
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,440
And then when I went on the
date that night with the girl,

389
00:10:23,441 --> 00:10:25,090
I was like barely into it.

390
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:25,541
And I was like,

391
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:30,250
I'd wanted to fuck this girl for so
long and we finally ran into each other

392
00:10:30,251 --> 00:10:31,390
somewhere and I was like,

393
00:10:31,391 --> 00:10:31,991
Holy Shit.

394
00:10:31,991 --> 00:10:33,130
And she was so down,

395
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,020
but I was like barely hard.

396
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,100
It was so sad.

397
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:38,200
I had a complete three quarters erection.

398
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,220
You've fucked up.

399
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,880
And she was the first girl that
wanted to put her finger in my ass.

400
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,190
I was like,

401
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:46,010
well you never forget that lady.

402
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:46,930
She goes,

403
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:47,830
I know what you want.

404
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,011
It's,

405
00:10:48,011 --> 00:10:48,611
this is what she said.

406
00:10:48,611 --> 00:10:48,851
She goes,

407
00:10:48,851 --> 00:10:49,660
I know what you want.

408
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,550
We were both like 17
or something like that.

409
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:52,891
I go,

410
00:10:52,891 --> 00:10:53,121
what it,

411
00:10:53,121 --> 00:10:53,860
what do I want?

412
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,191
She goes,

413
00:10:54,191 --> 00:10:55,750
you want me to stick
my finger in your ass?

414
00:10:55,751 --> 00:10:56,141
I was like,

415
00:10:56,141 --> 00:10:56,831
Whoa,

416
00:10:56,831 --> 00:10:59,260
what the f how wrong or you yeah,

417
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,850
like that you couldn't be more wrong.

418
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:01,691
Yeah.

419
00:11:01,691 --> 00:11:06,040
That's more like what you
want but automatically I want,

420
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,270
I didn't want a Griller,

421
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:07,631
you know,

422
00:11:07,631 --> 00:11:09,600
cause that's kind of rude
to do a girl you're dating,

423
00:11:09,601 --> 00:11:09,920
you know,

424
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,751
but you don't want to go.

425
00:11:10,751 --> 00:11:13,900
How many dudes have you stuck your
finger up their ass can cause if you just

426
00:11:13,901 --> 00:11:17,680
offer that up like the first time we
hook up and just offer up a finger up the

427
00:11:17,681 --> 00:11:22,681
ass and you're only 17 I think maybe
like maybe I was 18 and she was 17 or 19

428
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:25,020
and 18 one of the in the,

429
00:11:25,021 --> 00:11:25,810
in that range,

430
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,051
you know,

431
00:11:26,051 --> 00:11:28,570
right after high school or around that
it's like she's already done this.

432
00:11:28,571 --> 00:11:31,690
How many times I wonder how many
dudes buttholes this girl's uh,

433
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:32,050
just,

434
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:32,900
I know what you want.

435
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:33,311
I was like,

436
00:11:33,311 --> 00:11:33,641
yeah,

437
00:11:33,641 --> 00:11:34,120
you know,

438
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:34,871
go for it baby.

439
00:11:34,871 --> 00:11:36,250
Like just on a whim,

440
00:11:36,251 --> 00:11:37,300
on a hope that it's a good thing.

441
00:11:37,301 --> 00:11:37,960
Yeah.

442
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,970
And all of a sudden she's sucking
on her fingers and you going,

443
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:40,843
where's this going?

444
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:43,720
See in the world of Kurzwell
that we're talking about,

445
00:11:43,721 --> 00:11:45,940
the idea that you're going to
be able to record everything,

446
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:48,280
there will be a way that you
can act and the way that,

447
00:11:48,281 --> 00:11:50,470
like guys will hack into
their girlfriend's email.

448
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:53,290
You'll be able to hack into
your girlfriends like past,

449
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,500
like see a scan of like you
could actually just enter it in.

450
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,620
How many buttholes is
her finger been improved?

451
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,613
28.

452
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:01,530
It's a,

453
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:02,640
I'm reading that sexist.

454
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,493
Go on a book.

455
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,130
I'm reading this sex is pretty good.

456
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:05,341
Yeah,

457
00:12:05,341 --> 00:12:06,174
it's fascinating.

458
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,270
And one of the things that I find
fascinating is all the different theories

459
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:14,271
about why people act and behave certain
ways when it comes to like sexual,

460
00:12:15,061 --> 00:12:15,894
like uh,

461
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,870
how many sexual partners
has your wife had.

462
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:19,200
Yeah.

463
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,720
Why it's so important that
you limit that number.

464
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,370
That you can trust her and keep our Ra.

465
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,200
It's really fascinating stuff,

466
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:25,730
man.

467
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:26,340
Oh Man.

468
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,410
That book is incredible.

469
00:12:27,411 --> 00:12:28,270
I love that guy.

470
00:12:28,271 --> 00:12:28,670
Good.

471
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,320
That's a really cool dude too.

472
00:12:30,321 --> 00:12:31,041
Chris Ryan,

473
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,090
he's bred him on your podcast twice.

474
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:33,530
Twice.

475
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:33,720
Yeah.

476
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,490
Twice.

477
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,860
Get in touch with him and
try to see if he'll do this.

478
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:37,251
Cause he,

479
00:12:37,251 --> 00:12:37,890
he's uh,

480
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,770
he's really very interesting.

481
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,110
I love the part about the Yucatan,

482
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,300
the name of the Yucatan.

483
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,090
Do you remember that part?

484
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:45,923
I don't remember that.

485
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,360
The they,

486
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:52,420
when Columbus is people or
Cortez of came to the Yucatan,

487
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,950
they asked the people like,

488
00:12:54,951 --> 00:12:55,370
what?

489
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,630
What do you call this place?

490
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,190
And they made this sound,

491
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,713
not that sound,

492
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,020
but they made the sound like
we could talk her at home,

493
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:03,561
you know,

494
00:13:03,561 --> 00:13:05,690
and the guy said you could
tighten close enough caught.

495
00:13:05,691 --> 00:13:07,610
So they say we're going
to call it the Yucatan.

496
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,091
Well,

497
00:13:08,091 --> 00:13:09,980
it turned out that the Mayan scholars,

498
00:13:09,981 --> 00:13:12,620
after all those years of deciphering they,

499
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,120
they do that.

500
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,190
What he was trying to say was,

501
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,480
I don't understand what you're saying.

502
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:19,760
That's what he was saying,

503
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,720
that they had taken to
you to talk to Larry.

504
00:13:23,721 --> 00:13:24,620
Isn't that amazing?

505
00:13:24,621 --> 00:13:25,100
Yeah.

506
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,150
That's such an amazing,

507
00:13:26,151 --> 00:13:28,310
like I love knowing shit like that,

508
00:13:28,311 --> 00:13:31,610
like house and then knowing that that
was only a few hundred years ago.

509
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,090
Right.

510
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:33,500
That's really kind of nuts.

511
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:38,540
W we're so spoiled by
the time that we arrived,

512
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:38,991
you know,

513
00:13:38,991 --> 00:13:39,131
we're,

514
00:13:39,131 --> 00:13:44,131
we're so spoiled that being alive in the
year 2012 like just a few hundred years

515
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:46,670
ago,

516
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:51,670
there was people that in boats and just
traveled and didn't know where the fuck

517
00:13:52,341 --> 00:13:53,174
they were going.

518
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,220
And had no idea what they
would find and didn't have it

519
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,113
math.

520
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:58,980
But Dude,

521
00:13:58,981 --> 00:14:01,000
think about what is it 500 years ago.

522
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:05,410
I love to think about that and I love
to think about that fucking feeling,

523
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:06,400
that feeling that,

524
00:14:06,401 --> 00:14:07,840
that that's a feeling.

525
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:08,441
I mean,

526
00:14:08,441 --> 00:14:09,490
we can find that.

527
00:14:09,491 --> 00:14:09,671
I mean,

528
00:14:09,671 --> 00:14:09,791
yeah,

529
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:10,061
you could,

530
00:14:10,061 --> 00:14:10,271
you know,

531
00:14:10,271 --> 00:14:11,470
esoterically say,

532
00:14:11,471 --> 00:14:11,771
you know,

533
00:14:11,771 --> 00:14:15,060
we can search into the world of
psychedelics for new lands or,

534
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:15,940
yeah.

535
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,300
But no one is ever going to know
until interstellar travel happens.

536
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:24,340
No one's ever going to know that fucking
feeling of being on a ship and for the

537
00:14:24,341 --> 00:14:28,170
first time seeing land in a place
where no one knows there's land.

538
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:28,720
Yeah.

539
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,100
And the idea that you would have the
audacity to go look in the ocean,

540
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:36,010
to not know what's on the other side,

541
00:14:36,011 --> 00:14:37,960
to just go out there like,

542
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,070
oh my God,

543
00:14:39,071 --> 00:14:41,050
you had to have fucking tremendous balls.

544
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:41,680
Yeah.

545
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,100
And the,

546
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:42,660
the,

547
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,510
that was one of the things,

548
00:14:43,511 --> 00:14:47,560
it must've been amazing back then
was the ability to see the stars.

549
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,690
Like as long as it wasn't cloudy out,

550
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:54,890
you could really see everything because
there was no light pollution where if

551
00:14:54,891 --> 00:14:55,220
you,

552
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,620
if you've ever been in the country
in the middle of the night,

553
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:57,980
oh yeah.

554
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,730
To look up and on a clear night and just
see a fucking unbelievable amounts of

555
00:15:01,731 --> 00:15:02,540
stars.

556
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:06,590
It really makes you sad that that's
not a regular feature like that.

557
00:15:06,591 --> 00:15:10,430
What we've done by creating these
beautiful cities and these safe roads to

558
00:15:10,431 --> 00:15:11,210
travel on,

559
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:15,680
we've disconnected ourselves from the
vision of the cosmos of our part in the

560
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:16,490
cosmos.

561
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:17,150
Yeah.

562
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,320
When you're like in the country,

563
00:15:18,321 --> 00:15:18,591
man,

564
00:15:18,591 --> 00:15:22,310
you're staying in a farm and you go like
kick back in a hammock and you look up

565
00:15:22,311 --> 00:15:25,970
and the entire sky is filled with stars.

566
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:29,750
That is a perspective
enhancing experience.

567
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:34,870
That's a visual psychedelic staring at
the stars is a very visual psychedelic.

568
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:35,661
Well,

569
00:15:35,661 --> 00:15:39,860
I mean you've got like white
pouring into your eyes.

570
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:40,370
Yeah.

571
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:43,190
From the far reaches of the universe.

572
00:15:43,191 --> 00:15:43,760
You're,

573
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,320
you've got light coming into your eyes.

574
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,250
It's from,

575
00:15:46,251 --> 00:15:49,130
so like it's so long ago

576
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:50,170
you,

577
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:50,420
you,

578
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:54,290
you're getting that feeling that you get
when you see something beautiful that

579
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,920
we seek out beautiful things
which we seek out them,

580
00:15:57,921 --> 00:16:02,480
whether their flowers or
sculptures or a person or car.

581
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:05,930
There's something that strikes us
when we see something beautiful.

582
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,141
You know,

583
00:16:06,141 --> 00:16:08,510
it's all subjective to each person.

584
00:16:08,511 --> 00:16:11,840
Whenever they're beautiful is it he
lights that charge in their mind?

585
00:16:11,841 --> 00:16:12,290
Yeah.

586
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:16,160
I'll give you ever seen a guy who's like
really into old cars and he sees an old

587
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,510
corvette or something like that.

588
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:22,630
Oh this is a 67 look at the lines on this
baby and you see him like his fucking

589
00:16:23,181 --> 00:16:25,100
eyes light up and like these,

590
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:28,340
there's a charge that a person
gets from a thing of beauty,

591
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:29,710
from seeing something that's

592
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,170
beautiful.

593
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:35,170
There's an idea that that thing of beauty
is lying underneath everything that

594
00:16:35,841 --> 00:16:40,841
the world is just covering that beauty
up and that people use objects as a way

595
00:16:41,091 --> 00:16:43,940
to limit the beauty because to,

596
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:48,650
to like really accept the whole thing is
like would be so potent that you start

597
00:16:48,651 --> 00:16:52,220
off like getting that feeling from cars
or you start off getting that feeling

598
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:55,940
from looking up at the sky or you start
off getting that feeling from falling in

599
00:16:55,941 --> 00:16:56,271
love.

600
00:16:56,271 --> 00:16:59,360
But like that feeling is
like underneath everything,

601
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:02,330
that's what everything is
composed of is that sense of like,

602
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:03,890
wow,

603
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,210
holy shit.

604
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,530
Cause that's like a peak.

605
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,820
That's a peak feeling,

606
00:17:07,821 --> 00:17:10,250
that feeling of being like
whatever the thing is,

607
00:17:10,251 --> 00:17:11,240
the activates it.

608
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,160
Sometimes I think that maybe
that's what enlightenment is,

609
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:16,220
is when you just hit
that feeling perpetually.

610
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,560
You're just perpetually
in that space of like,

611
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,090
wow,

612
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:22,400
this is amazing.

613
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:23,161
I,

614
00:17:23,161 --> 00:17:23,994
uh,

615
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:27,750
I had a friend who was like really into
Buddhism and she had this thing on her

616
00:17:27,751 --> 00:17:28,610
wall that said,

617
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:28,980
uh,

618
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:32,610
Lightman is enlightenment is
possible in this lifetime.

619
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:33,390
Yeah.

620
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:34,500
And I remember reading that going,

621
00:17:34,501 --> 00:17:34,741
wow,

622
00:17:34,741 --> 00:17:36,600
that is a profound statement.

623
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:37,141
You know,

624
00:17:37,141 --> 00:17:39,780
enlightenment is possible
in this lifetime.

625
00:17:39,781 --> 00:17:40,790
And I remember thinking like,

626
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:41,460
wow,

627
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:41,880
what a,

628
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:46,560
what a weird thing we all
have in our heads is this,

629
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:49,760
this burning desire to get shit together.

630
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:52,820
Like everybody would
love to be enlightened.

631
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:53,460
You know,

632
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,280
be aware of anybody
who tells you they are,

633
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,300
be aware of anybody,

634
00:17:56,301 --> 00:17:57,380
tells you they don't want to be.

635
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,311
Wow.

636
00:17:58,311 --> 00:17:59,030
That's great.

637
00:17:59,030 --> 00:17:59,250
Yeah.

638
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,083
Just made that up.

639
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,080
That's great dude.

640
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:01,940
That's really good.

641
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:02,830
It's delicious.

642
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:03,190
Yeah.

643
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,150
It's a gift from the university.

644
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:04,730
Yeah.

645
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:04,950
That,

646
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:05,783
that really is.

647
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,660
I'm sure somebody's
probably already said it so

648
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:08,830
already.

649
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:09,101
Yeah.

650
00:18:09,101 --> 00:18:09,934
That's big.

651
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,661
That's too good.

652
00:18:10,661 --> 00:18:11,494
I couldn't have made that one up.

653
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:11,681
No,

654
00:18:11,681 --> 00:18:12,391
I've never heard it before.

655
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:12,701
I've heard it.

656
00:18:12,701 --> 00:18:13,870
If you see the boot on the road,

657
00:18:13,871 --> 00:18:14,231
kill him.

658
00:18:14,231 --> 00:18:18,250
I've never heard the where of anybody
who says they're enlightened or who says

659
00:18:18,251 --> 00:18:19,084
they don't want to be

660
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:22,620
pretty good when you talk to people and
they have this box that they don't want

661
00:18:22,621 --> 00:18:23,510
to operate in a

662
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:25,500
real,

663
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,000
live and die.

664
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,170
That's like our,

665
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:29,040
our thing.

666
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,170
We did and you and I broke
down that country western.

667
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:31,820
Oh yeah.

668
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,410
You know?

669
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:33,243
Yeah.

670
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,710
That ridiculous.

671
00:18:34,711 --> 00:18:35,730
A NDA girl,

672
00:18:35,731 --> 00:18:37,500
but happy to be a single celled organism.

673
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:38,730
Anybody who wants to change that,

674
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,600
you've got to come through me.

675
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:40,330
Yeah,

676
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:40,930
yeah man.

677
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:41,440
It's that,

678
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,370
that kind of Co,

679
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:42,941
you know,

680
00:18:42,941 --> 00:18:47,050
constricted life sucks for the person
who's living in the constricted life and

681
00:18:47,051 --> 00:18:50,050
for the people living around the person
and the constricted life and it's like

682
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,093
you can,

683
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,880
if you just play around with that
fucking idea that you can permanently,

684
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:00,100
permanently shift your consciousness so
that you are experiencing life in the

685
00:19:00,101 --> 00:19:03,460
way that like those however many times
you've had to happen in your life.

686
00:19:03,461 --> 00:19:04,151
Some people more,

687
00:19:04,151 --> 00:19:09,151
sometimes last when you're for the first
time you like accomplish some big thing

688
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:10,870
and you get that sense of like,

689
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,681
oh my God,

690
00:19:11,681 --> 00:19:11,891
man,

691
00:19:11,891 --> 00:19:12,724
I can fucking,

692
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:16,000
I can really do shit that
I didn't think I could do.

693
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:19,180
That feeling is like the
universe at that moment unfolds.

694
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:21,640
It's like a whole new room,

695
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,520
a whole new giant land pops open
and your subjective universe.

696
00:19:25,521 --> 00:19:25,901
We were like,

697
00:19:25,901 --> 00:19:26,734
wow,

698
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:30,310
there's an entire other part of
this life I had no idea about.

699
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:30,701
Well,

700
00:19:30,701 --> 00:19:35,701
it's like if you can always be in that
state of recognizing that this is the

701
00:19:36,491 --> 00:19:39,970
most beautiful peak experience
that could happen to anything,

702
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:42,250
which I think is what enlightened people,

703
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,780
the people I've been around,

704
00:19:43,781 --> 00:19:44,710
you are.

705
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:45,990
Yeah,

706
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:46,890
very advanced.

707
00:19:46,891 --> 00:19:47,970
I wouldn't call them enlightened.

708
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,230
They're just happy man.

709
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,550
They're just like hobbies,

710
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,900
the wrong word for it though.

711
00:19:51,901 --> 00:19:55,020
They're like connected and there

712
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:56,461
really,

713
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:57,294
really

714
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,670
not afraid to express love.

715
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:01,121
You know?

716
00:20:01,121 --> 00:20:01,751
They're very,

717
00:20:01,751 --> 00:20:03,520
they're feeling love all the time.

718
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:07,000
I think that that's a cool idea that
you could feel that all the time.

719
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:10,150
I think that's a beautiful idea that
you could be in that place all the time.

720
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,270
If you're careful about your friends,

721
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:12,811
you know,

722
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:13,201
and you,

723
00:20:13,201 --> 00:20:15,480
you only surround yourself
with positive people.

724
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,620
I think you worked out,

725
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,480
I think you can do that all the time.

726
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,180
It's all about constructing
that environment though.

727
00:20:21,181 --> 00:20:21,481
You know,

728
00:20:21,481 --> 00:20:24,540
you have to like do that by
sharp editing throughout,

729
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:25,410
throughout your entire life.

730
00:20:25,411 --> 00:20:27,870
You've got to figure out how to
edit yourself and edit people.

731
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:28,350
Right.

732
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:28,591
You know,

733
00:20:28,591 --> 00:20:30,060
you've got to figure out how to get,

734
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,320
get the most,

735
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:31,991
like they'll,

736
00:20:31,991 --> 00:20:35,820
they'll get rid of as many of
your own negative instances.

737
00:20:35,821 --> 00:20:37,890
Any of those that you can get away with,

738
00:20:37,891 --> 00:20:38,310
not,

739
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,630
not causing yourself,

740
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,250
like minimize that,

741
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,510
tried to get it down to zero.

742
00:20:42,511 --> 00:20:43,344
We're none.

743
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:48,410
None of the negative moments are created
because of your actions and figure out

744
00:20:48,521 --> 00:20:53,020
who's creating all those other negative
moments and eliminate the interaction

745
00:20:53,021 --> 00:20:53,854
with those people.

746
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:54,220
I mean,

747
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:59,220
if you can do that and
then find likeminded folks
who will not put anything,

748
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:02,830
try not to do anything negative to
their friends and don't want to accept

749
00:21:02,831 --> 00:21:03,820
anything negative either.

750
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,601
The near about,

751
00:21:04,601 --> 00:21:06,330
around a bunch of people
who love each other.

752
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:10,140
Let me throw out an idea because
this is what you're talking about.

753
00:21:10,141 --> 00:21:12,780
It's something that some hippie
bullshit will start to calm.

754
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,000
You ain't hippy bullshit,

755
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:14,250
man.

756
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,420
This is like the idea of like,

757
00:21:15,421 --> 00:21:15,900
well,

758
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,890
in the beginning,

759
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:17,461
you know,

760
00:21:17,461 --> 00:21:17,850
there's,

761
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:18,420
there's uh,

762
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,253
uh,

763
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:21,630
the beginning of spiritual
life is what they say.

764
00:21:21,631 --> 00:21:24,310
They say the beginning of
spiritual life is like a tea,

765
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:24,761
like a,

766
00:21:24,761 --> 00:21:26,490
a tendril like uh,

767
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:26,970
uh,

768
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:28,770
the beginning of like when a tree grows,

769
00:21:28,771 --> 00:21:29,160
right?

770
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,840
And when a trees growing at first,

771
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:31,620
uh,

772
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:35,940
the most gigantic trees started
off as a tiny little fucking sprig.

773
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:38,070
So when you're in that place,

774
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,690
it's really important to keep shit out.

775
00:21:39,691 --> 00:21:40,860
They can like fuck you up.

776
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,490
And that's the idea of cutting people
out or like cutting out the negative

777
00:21:44,491 --> 00:21:45,090
elements.

778
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:48,540
But then there's this other idea that I
was listening to some Ron doss lecture.

779
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:53,540
He's talking about reactivity and that
when you're around someone who's got a

780
00:21:53,941 --> 00:21:57,420
difficult personality or someone
who's like an instigator,

781
00:21:57,421 --> 00:21:58,860
a drama vortex,

782
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:03,300
you still get to decide if you're going
to be reactive to that person or not.

783
00:22:03,301 --> 00:22:07,050
You still get to be in control of
the way you feel around that person.

784
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,100
But in the beginning,

785
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:11,190
that person can make you feel like
shit when you're around an asshole.

786
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,390
Your mood will drop,

787
00:22:12,391 --> 00:22:13,260
your mood shifts,

788
00:22:13,261 --> 00:22:13,981
you get mad,

789
00:22:13,981 --> 00:22:14,791
you get unhappy,

790
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:15,870
you feel threatened.

791
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,130
But the idea is,

792
00:22:17,131 --> 00:22:20,850
is as you advance in gain more and
more control of your consciousness,

793
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,290
then that stops happening.

794
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,980
So you use that asshole
as an emotional gym.

795
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,173
Yes.

796
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:30,920
You use them as an emotional or a
psychological growth sparring partner.

797
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,221
Yeah.

798
00:22:31,221 --> 00:22:33,110
And as you deal with their Douchey Enos,

799
00:22:33,111 --> 00:22:36,350
you learn how to better navigate
Douche Enos throughout your life.

800
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:36,701
Yeah.

801
00:22:36,701 --> 00:22:40,210
And also for the first time when the
asshole is around someone who isn't

802
00:22:40,211 --> 00:22:41,920
reacting to them being an asshole,

803
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,031
they're going to be like,

804
00:22:43,031 --> 00:22:44,080
what the fuck is this?

805
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,510
Cause then if their whole life
they've been going through life,

806
00:22:46,511 --> 00:22:47,830
getting cues from people like,

807
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,360
Oh I don't think so.

808
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:49,690
No.

809
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:50,270
Right.

810
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:53,260
So all of a sudden if they're
around someone who's like beaming,

811
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,011
you know,

812
00:22:54,011 --> 00:22:55,390
beaming and the way that they,

813
00:22:55,391 --> 00:22:57,160
you would be beaming
around when you saw it.

814
00:22:57,161 --> 00:22:59,170
Like when Joey Diaz walks into a room,

815
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:01,450
you're beaming that way around a cunt.

816
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:02,501
Suddenly they're like,

817
00:23:02,501 --> 00:23:04,870
what the fuck is this?

818
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,830
Well the real problem though is
when they become physically violent,

819
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,660
when you have dump
constant wanna Punch you,

820
00:23:12,661 --> 00:23:14,250
that's when you run into a real situation.

821
00:23:14,251 --> 00:23:14,690
Yes.

822
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:15,523
But how often did,

823
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,550
I mean that doesn't happen
that most of the time,

824
00:23:17,551 --> 00:23:19,950
but you've managed to
surround yourself with,

825
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,550
you know,

826
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:21,383
hipsters.

827
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,640
I mean if you're in certain
parts of the country,

828
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,200
certain parts of a city,

829
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:26,180
you can,

830
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,630
you get punched in the face randomly.

831
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:28,810
I've seen it.

832
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:29,011
Terror.

833
00:23:29,011 --> 00:23:29,880
There's a terrible video,

834
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,560
a woman in London,

835
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,930
some guy just comes and
cracks are for no reason.

836
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,580
It's not that they're
looking for the guys,

837
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:38,010
some teenage girls knocked unconscious,

838
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,480
demonic son of a bitch.

839
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:42,570
It's just fucked up that people are
capable of doing shit like that and that

840
00:23:42,571 --> 00:23:42,880
there's,

841
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,430
there's the broad spectrum of
the possible human actions.

842
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,331
It's so broad.

843
00:23:48,331 --> 00:23:48,720
I mean,

844
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,920
you could be a god that she could have
crossed paths with a guy who was like,

845
00:23:52,921 --> 00:23:53,910
good morning,

846
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:54,960
you know,

847
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,950
top of the day to you and been real happy
and made her feel really good and she

848
00:23:58,951 --> 00:24:00,120
could have moved on to,

849
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:00,721
you know,

850
00:24:00,721 --> 00:24:01,830
her job or whatever,

851
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,090
feeling like really good.

852
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:07,320
Instead she runs into the wrong guy and
he cracks or knocks her unconscious for

853
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:08,790
nos for no reason whatsoever.

854
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,140
She hits her head on the concrete.

855
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,050
I saw it,

856
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:11,261
dude,

857
00:24:11,261 --> 00:24:12,880
she's out but horrible.

858
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:13,691
You know what's amazing,

859
00:24:13,691 --> 00:24:13,930
man?

860
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:14,561
This is again,

861
00:24:14,561 --> 00:24:16,090
that shit we were talking
about in the beginning.

862
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,270
This is the shift that's happening
because there was a time in human history

863
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:23,350
when a thug go galloping up behind some
young last in the street and knock her

864
00:24:23,351 --> 00:24:27,220
down and like the entire planet doesn't
know about it in a matter of like eight

865
00:24:27,221 --> 00:24:28,054
hours,

866
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,631
you know this,

867
00:24:28,631 --> 00:24:29,260
this is them.

868
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:33,810
This is the incredible time that we're
in is that that it's a double edged

869
00:24:33,811 --> 00:24:34,090
sword.

870
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:35,320
You see something like that and you,

871
00:24:35,321 --> 00:24:35,590
you're,

872
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:36,640
you're either going to be like,

873
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:37,781
God damn,

874
00:24:37,781 --> 00:24:39,850
this is a fucked up world or living in I,

875
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:43,450
there's guys we'll just run up behind
someone and punch him in the head.

876
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,010
Or the other side of it is like,

877
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,870
fuck in one,

878
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:47,733
you know,

879
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:48,880
a day or two,

880
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,110
this act of violence has been broadcast
all over the planet and has created a

881
00:24:53,111 --> 00:24:56,500
situation where people could like
talk about how awful it is and how,

882
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,160
how,

883
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,500
how bad that is that people
are like that and it,

884
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:01,470
I think that elevates us a little bit.

885
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:04,650
I think it just takes a lot more time
than we're used to it because we're used

886
00:25:04,651 --> 00:25:09,390
to like processing power going up in a
year and a hard drive space doubling.

887
00:25:09,391 --> 00:25:09,840
Yes,

888
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,690
we're used to all these massive
improvements and then we,

889
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:15,240
we don't see that in human nature.

890
00:25:15,241 --> 00:25:16,530
And it's really frustrating,

891
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,221
you know,

892
00:25:17,221 --> 00:25:18,810
I think that this,

893
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:19,560
this,

894
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:19,920
you know,

895
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,460
shifting,

896
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,293
we keep saying,

897
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:23,880
I think it's just more subtle
than people would like,

898
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:26,350
it's not as fast as a going from a,

899
00:25:26,351 --> 00:25:29,280
an old tube television
to a 55 inch flat screen.

900
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:29,970
It's not,

901
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:30,271
you know,

902
00:25:30,271 --> 00:25:30,601
it's not,

903
00:25:30,601 --> 00:25:34,110
it's something difference
between having Dsl and,

904
00:25:34,111 --> 00:25:34,441
you know,

905
00:25:34,441 --> 00:25:35,221
having a,

906
00:25:35,221 --> 00:25:35,850
you know,

907
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:36,840
56 k,

908
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:37,261
you know,

909
00:25:37,261 --> 00:25:37,411
it's,

910
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:37,711
it's,

911
00:25:37,711 --> 00:25:37,981
it's,

912
00:25:37,981 --> 00:25:38,281
it's,

913
00:25:38,281 --> 00:25:39,510
it's too small.

914
00:25:39,511 --> 00:25:40,050
It was like,

915
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:45,050
so when we still see these versions
of the worst case scenarios of human

916
00:25:45,391 --> 00:25:46,224
behavior,

917
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:48,240
it's shocking to us that they still exist,

918
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,230
but I think the direction
is for them to exist less.

919
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:55,750
It seems like more and
more as part of the shift,

920
00:25:56,110 --> 00:26:00,280
things are standing out that aren't
shifting more and more so like,

921
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:00,941
you know,

922
00:26:00,941 --> 00:26:02,380
like Romney for example,

923
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:03,170
or like,

924
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:03,830
uh,

925
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:04,240
uh,

926
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,980
these like crazy fucking like,

927
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:06,791
uh,

928
00:26:06,791 --> 00:26:07,361
you know,

929
00:26:07,361 --> 00:26:11,830
homophobic antiabortion Republicans
talking about my family.

930
00:26:11,831 --> 00:26:12,060
Boy,

931
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,930
he's crusty old sons of bitches.

932
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,080
More and more are starting
to look like monsters there.

933
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:20,680
They're starting to look more like
freaks a whereas they used to be able to

934
00:26:20,681 --> 00:26:21,280
like,

935
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:21,700
you know,

936
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:25,990
they used to be able to turn fucking high
powered water hoses on crowds of black

937
00:26:25,991 --> 00:26:26,740
people.

938
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,071
You know,

939
00:26:27,071 --> 00:26:27,761
that without,

940
00:26:27,761 --> 00:26:29,800
without losing their jobs.

941
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,180
You know what I mean?

942
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:31,780
Like,

943
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,321
so this,

944
00:26:32,321 --> 00:26:33,640
this shift is like,

945
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:38,110
but it's really interesting to watch
the way that a lot of these crusty old

946
00:26:38,111 --> 00:26:39,610
pundits are reacting to it.

947
00:26:39,611 --> 00:26:39,821
Man.

948
00:26:39,821 --> 00:26:43,200
They're having the same effect that when
they threw water on the witch and the

949
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:44,100
wizard of Oz,

950
00:26:44,101 --> 00:26:44,401
you know,

951
00:26:44,401 --> 00:26:48,540
that kind of like they're hissing and
shrieking and they don't how to deal with

952
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:49,120
it.

953
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,840
What's fascinating to
me is that with this,

954
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:58,630
with this new sort of a understanding
of people that were getting,

955
00:26:58,631 --> 00:26:59,371
because of the Internet,

956
00:26:59,371 --> 00:27:00,201
there's water all over me.

957
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:01,150
I spilled coffee on me.

958
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:04,760
I have a nice shirt and I don't
want to ruin it with this new,

959
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:09,250
this new understanding
that people have of like

960
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:13,270
having the access to
these kinds of stories,

961
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:16,570
having the access to these horrible
stories that are things that are happening

962
00:27:16,571 --> 00:27:17,590
from the Gaza Strip,

963
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:21,160
that this shift that's going on.

964
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,750
Like as it's happening,

965
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:27,940
all these horrific things that
still exists in the world,

966
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:32,170
they seem to escalate almost as if they're
worried that something's coming out.

967
00:27:32,171 --> 00:27:33,190
I'm almost as if like,

968
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:33,851
it's the,

969
00:27:33,851 --> 00:27:34,031
the,

970
00:27:34,031 --> 00:27:34,630
the,

971
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:34,991
you know,

972
00:27:34,991 --> 00:27:35,310
the,

973
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:35,890
uh,

974
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:40,000
fundamentalism gets even more and more
extreme and more and more hate for more

975
00:27:40,001 --> 00:27:43,780
and more crazy and you start getting shit
like Dodd hates fags and guys holding

976
00:27:43,781 --> 00:27:44,560
up the fucking sign.

977
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,300
They have a whole website dedicated to it.

978
00:27:46,301 --> 00:27:47,320
And like all of that,

979
00:27:47,321 --> 00:27:48,940
that the hate that you see with,

980
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:49,490
you know,

981
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:50,530
w we had um,

982
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,793
uh,

983
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:57,360
on the podcast we had this conversation
with Shane Smith about Pakistan and

984
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:01,360
India and the potential for nuclear
war and it was one of the scariest

985
00:28:01,361 --> 00:28:04,470
conversations ever
because these people like,

986
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:08,830
it's like almost like a lost state like
Pakistan who was talked to him like how

987
00:28:08,831 --> 00:28:12,550
chaotic it is and how
chaotic the rulership is and
how they hate Indian India

988
00:28:12,551 --> 00:28:16,450
hates them and that different leaders
have said they wanted a strap themselves

989
00:28:16,451 --> 00:28:20,020
to a nuclear bomb and go over there
and blow the other people up like that.

990
00:28:20,021 --> 00:28:23,770
This all exists at the same time as these,

991
00:28:23,771 --> 00:28:25,720
this new understanding of this new shift.

992
00:28:25,721 --> 00:28:29,680
It's almost like it's this resistance
and it's almost like this thing that we

993
00:28:29,681 --> 00:28:31,060
have to rally against,

994
00:28:31,061 --> 00:28:33,280
like the most fucked up
part of human nature.

995
00:28:33,281 --> 00:28:37,350
It's like we have to rally against
that and that's what Unites People

996
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:40,570
[inaudible] otherwise we'd be too
lazy or the ones we have to it,

997
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,980
we would accept mediocrity.

998
00:28:41,981 --> 00:28:46,981
We would accept a certain slow tempo to
the evolution of human consciousness.

999
00:28:48,011 --> 00:28:50,650
But this forces it to act.

1000
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:53,200
I could all the evil
and all the fucked up,

1001
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:58,290
the actions of the world and fucking drone
attacks and all this craziness forces

1002
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:00,400
us to act and think,

1003
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,470
well it's again man.

1004
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:02,551
Yes I agree.

1005
00:29:02,551 --> 00:29:03,030
Like in,

1006
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:03,540
you know,

1007
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:06,420
there's part of me that gets scared
cause I feel like that thing gets backed

1008
00:29:06,421 --> 00:29:07,630
into a corner and its size,

1009
00:29:07,631 --> 00:29:08,011
the press,

1010
00:29:08,011 --> 00:29:08,790
the button.

1011
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,770
But I think what's really,

1012
00:29:10,771 --> 00:29:12,930
what's happening is an
amplification effect.

1013
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:17,130
I think acts of violence are becoming

1014
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,260
less but becoming more
amplified because we're so,

1015
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,800
we're becoming so much more
appalled at the idea of like,

1016
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:25,341
uh,

1017
00:29:25,341 --> 00:29:25,790
the,

1018
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:29,120
the barbarism of war and all
this shit that humans do.

1019
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,020
Uh,

1020
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:30,561
I think that,

1021
00:29:30,561 --> 00:29:30,920
that,

1022
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,430
that,

1023
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:34,430
that what's happening is God hates fags.

1024
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,570
These people pop up,

1025
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,320
right?

1026
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,430
And then what happens though,

1027
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:41,410
people organized from the Internet and
suddenly God hates fags is whenever,

1028
00:29:41,411 --> 00:29:42,244
wherever they go,

1029
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,320
they get surrounded by mobs,

1030
00:29:44,321 --> 00:29:45,400
holding signs.

1031
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:46,840
God hates signs.

1032
00:29:46,841 --> 00:29:47,680
God hates this.

1033
00:29:47,681 --> 00:29:50,410
God hates that giant
signs blocking them out.

1034
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:53,020
So it's like the hate is getting absorbed.

1035
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:53,740
It's getting up.

1036
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,640
It's not working,

1037
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:55,481
it's not working.

1038
00:29:55,481 --> 00:29:59,230
It just seems like it's horrible because
it's being broadcast to so many people,

1039
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,940
but the way people are reacting,

1040
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,080
that's what's important.

1041
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,190
That's what's important.

1042
00:30:03,191 --> 00:30:04,900
As long as people are reacting,

1043
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,510
you know that's the number
one thing and not ignoring it.

1044
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:08,523
That's great.

1045
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,600
And as long as people were
reacting in whatever way,

1046
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:13,540
just fucking as simple as the
thing is like just tweeting,

1047
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,190
just tweeting something,

1048
00:30:15,191 --> 00:30:17,770
re tweeting something about some
of the violence that's happening.

1049
00:30:17,771 --> 00:30:21,340
Just anything to get the information
out there and keep that fucking pop

1050
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:22,180
bubbling.

1051
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,260
That's Great Matt.

1052
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:24,191
That'll that,

1053
00:30:24,191 --> 00:30:29,110
that will continue to push the warmongers
into the periphery and I think that

1054
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,083
the the there,

1055
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:32,530
what just happened with
Romney and fucking Obama,

1056
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:33,010
I think,

1057
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:36,940
well we're lucky we look what's going on
with Egypt with a new president decided

1058
00:30:36,941 --> 00:30:38,570
to give himself all power.

1059
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,160
Yes,

1060
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,060
I'll all powerful,

1061
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:41,380
but look what's happening.

1062
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:42,670
Even their look what's happening.

1063
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,050
It's not what it is not working.

1064
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:46,150
It's not fucking working.

1065
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:46,960
That stuff doesn't,

1066
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,490
isn't working in the way it used to work.

1067
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:50,200
And that's the shift.

1068
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:55,300
The mojo that these fucking old
white dudes used to have is fading.

1069
00:30:55,301 --> 00:30:56,260
It's fading away,

1070
00:30:56,261 --> 00:30:56,890
man.

1071
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:57,720
It's like,

1072
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,590
it feels like the magic is leaving them,

1073
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:00,970
which is why it's so beautiful.

1074
00:31:00,971 --> 00:31:05,971
When you watched Karl Rove on Fox News
having a little like wizard of Oz style

1075
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:11,140
man behind the curtain meltdown as he
realizes that his evil scheme to try to

1076
00:31:11,141 --> 00:31:12,160
get Romney and the power,

1077
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:13,240
it didn't fucking work.

1078
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:13,570
Yeah.

1079
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:14,403
That's cool,

1080
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:14,710
Danny,

1081
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:15,040
isn't it?

1082
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:15,720
That's cool.

1083
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,500
That's was like,

1084
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,920
no though the numbers are wrong.

1085
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:18,670
The numbers are wrong.

1086
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:19,120
Yeah.

1087
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:19,811
He wouldn't admit it,

1088
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:20,051
man.

1089
00:31:20,051 --> 00:31:21,040
He wouldn't admit to defeat.

1090
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:21,520
Yeah.

1091
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,600
It's great to watch and a
lot of them are like it.

1092
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,870
That's what's happening is they,

1093
00:31:24,871 --> 00:31:26,560
they don't want to admit they,

1094
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:31,300
they're always upholding the virtues
of this country and how we come from

1095
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:32,380
revolution,

1096
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:34,540
but when the real
revolution starts happening,

1097
00:31:34,541 --> 00:31:34,930
they're like,

1098
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:36,430
I'm going to succeed now.

1099
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:40,180
I'm going to succeed because the real
revolution isn't a revolution where we all

1100
00:31:40,181 --> 00:31:43,010
get to hide in our shacks
and collect our fucking gun.

1101
00:31:43,011 --> 00:31:43,150
Yeah.

1102
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:44,650
Look at this flower is photos,

1103
00:31:44,651 --> 00:31:47,920
200,000 Egyptians and they're protesting.

1104
00:31:47,921 --> 00:31:52,921
What's crazy is they're protesting
around an ancient obelisk from,

1105
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,053
you know,

1106
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:55,450
the dynastic Egypt.

1107
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:59,530
It's just incredible stone mystery
that's covered in hieroglyphs.

1108
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:03,730
And these people are protesting around
it and screaming and yelling that you

1109
00:32:03,731 --> 00:32:06,130
can't have fucking you.

1110
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:06,371
We,

1111
00:32:06,371 --> 00:32:06,591
we,

1112
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:06,820
we,

1113
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,361
we're done.

1114
00:32:07,361 --> 00:32:08,830
Like we elected someone.

1115
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:11,140
The idea is that we're now in a democracy.

1116
00:32:11,141 --> 00:32:13,010
You cannot have this crazy to autograph,

1117
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,320
but he wants to,

1118
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,720
he wants to say that
he can't get arrested.

1119
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:17,561
He can't go.

1120
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:18,331
Jay like,

1121
00:32:18,331 --> 00:32:19,530
can't be treating word.

1122
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:20,141
Look at that.

1123
00:32:20,141 --> 00:32:21,030
Didn't work asshole.

1124
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:23,200
Amazing though that he
would want to do that.

1125
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,510
And he says it's because
of his opposition.

1126
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,250
Cause his opposition would try to do
terrible and Muslim Brotherhood it.

1127
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:29,501
Well,

1128
00:32:29,501 --> 00:32:30,370
he's the Muslim.

1129
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,250
The Muslim Brotherhood
is what's in power now.

1130
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,780
I at least I believe so.

1131
00:32:34,781 --> 00:32:35,620
I believe that's how it goes.

1132
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:36,191
For some reason.

1133
00:32:36,191 --> 00:32:36,821
I don't think that,

1134
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:37,301
but I don't know.

1135
00:32:37,301 --> 00:32:37,910
I haven't,

1136
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:38,740
I don't know.

1137
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,573
I might right.

1138
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,813
I don't know.

1139
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,180
I,

1140
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:44,990
well here it goes pro a protest or
stormed the headquarters of the Muslim

1141
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:47,150
Brotherhood and the country's
second largest city of,

1142
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:48,043
yeah.

1143
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,650
They know that some Muslims,

1144
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,630
the Muslim Brotherhood
is this guy wanted to uh,

1145
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:55,400
do something where he didn't have any,

1146
00:32:55,401 --> 00:32:55,880
uh,

1147
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,360
there was,

1148
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,193
he had no,

1149
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,040
no worries whatsoever about ever being
arrested in this actually could be a

1150
00:33:01,041 --> 00:33:01,730
dictator.

1151
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:02,690
You want wanted to be a dictator,

1152
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:03,190
right?

1153
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:03,550
They're like,

1154
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:03,770
no,

1155
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:04,940
because this isn't working.

1156
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:05,571
Sorry.

1157
00:33:05,571 --> 00:33:07,130
It's the same thing as
like when it's just,

1158
00:33:07,131 --> 00:33:09,890
whenever you start letting
freedom out of the bottle,

1159
00:33:09,891 --> 00:33:10,191
man,

1160
00:33:10,191 --> 00:33:11,480
you're not going to get the freedom back.

1161
00:33:11,481 --> 00:33:13,070
And once people feel that sense of like,

1162
00:33:13,071 --> 00:33:13,611
Holy Shit,

1163
00:33:13,611 --> 00:33:14,450
if we get together,

1164
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,700
we can change things in a big way.

1165
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,030
Yeah.

1166
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,290
You're not going to be suddenly
they're going to be like,

1167
00:33:18,291 --> 00:33:18,760
all right,

1168
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,640
we are okay.

1169
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,650
We'll let you be the new dictator.

1170
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,011
It's like,

1171
00:33:22,011 --> 00:33:22,491
no man.

1172
00:33:22,491 --> 00:33:23,324
We've learned.

1173
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,210
We've learned how to change
things through the group mind.

1174
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:29,390
Do you think it's possible though that
moving forward we're ever going to get to

1175
00:33:29,391 --> 00:33:30,970
a position of no.

1176
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,080
W.

1177
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:32,080
W.

1178
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:32,080
W.

1179
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,280
W we'll have no one above anyone else.

1180
00:33:34,281 --> 00:33:38,480
No one in a position of like president
or where they can take executive

1181
00:33:38,481 --> 00:33:39,314
privilege.

1182
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:42,350
Like Obama did that with that whole
gun running thing with that whole,

1183
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:42,681
you know,

1184
00:33:42,681 --> 00:33:43,400
that whole,

1185
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,030
uh,

1186
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,830
what the fuck they call
it fast and furious.

1187
00:33:45,831 --> 00:33:46,250
Yes.

1188
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:50,000
Or they sold guns to the Mexican
drug lords just to track them.

1189
00:33:50,001 --> 00:33:52,580
And those guns want to being
used on American citizens.

1190
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,890
Like it doesn't make any sense.

1191
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,071
The,

1192
00:33:55,071 --> 00:33:56,390
the store makes no sense.

1193
00:33:56,391 --> 00:33:59,450
Like their story that they would
sell guns to the Mexican drug lord,

1194
00:33:59,451 --> 00:34:00,590
so they get tracked the guns.

1195
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:03,170
That's one of the dumbest fucking
ideas I've ever heard in my life.

1196
00:34:03,171 --> 00:34:06,590
You're going to arm them with thousands
of guns so that you could track those

1197
00:34:06,591 --> 00:34:06,890
guns.

1198
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:07,280
Right.

1199
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,150
Who Do you think they got to do with?

1200
00:34:08,151 --> 00:34:09,170
Those guns are going to kill people.

1201
00:34:09,171 --> 00:34:10,710
That's the craziest idea of overheard.

1202
00:34:10,711 --> 00:34:11,180
Stupid.

1203
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:13,430
It almost like that's their excuse.

1204
00:34:13,431 --> 00:34:16,610
Like that's what they're going to say
and they have it planned out and make it

1205
00:34:16,611 --> 00:34:17,420
look like that's the doing.

1206
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,550
But really what they're doing is
they're profiting on selling guns.

1207
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:22,940
Cut that because Dave and
they're just playing dumb.

1208
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:23,450
Yeah,

1209
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:24,740
that makes a lot more sense to me.

1210
00:34:24,741 --> 00:34:28,100
It doesn't make any sense to me that
someone would think that selling criminals

1211
00:34:28,101 --> 00:34:31,250
guns is a good idea because then you could
track the guns like what the fuck are

1212
00:34:31,251 --> 00:34:32,084
you talking about,

1213
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:33,323
dude?

1214
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,320
I mean that's a problem.

1215
00:34:34,321 --> 00:34:36,180
That shit gets so obscured by,

1216
00:34:36,181 --> 00:34:36,700
like they,

1217
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:41,130
they have so many great ways
of like diffusing information
of adding information

1218
00:34:41,131 --> 00:34:45,120
to information that's not
real of subtracting shit
that it becomes that who the

1219
00:34:45,121 --> 00:34:46,090
fuck knows what is right.

1220
00:34:46,091 --> 00:34:46,250
Yeah.

1221
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,960
When it becomes a part of,

1222
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:48,950
you know,

1223
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:53,060
like the government where the
president doesn't have to yes.

1224
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:54,320
Get tried on this.

1225
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:54,440
The,

1226
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:54,670
the,

1227
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,270
he can invoke this executive privilege.

1228
00:34:56,271 --> 00:34:58,850
He doesn't have to
testify that's squirrely.

1229
00:34:59,120 --> 00:34:59,661
That shit.

1230
00:34:59,661 --> 00:35:01,340
Squirly never,

1231
00:35:01,341 --> 00:35:03,770
I don't think there's
ever a time where anyone,

1232
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:05,510
she'd be able to say like,

1233
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,200
oh,

1234
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:10,670
I had something to do with that whole
guns being sold to fucking crazy people

1235
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:12,590
who kill people on a regular basis.

1236
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:13,910
But I don't want to talk about it.

1237
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:14,450
Like,

1238
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:16,220
you either knew about it
or you didn't know that.

1239
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:16,400
Well,

1240
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,201
it's like we hired you,

1241
00:35:17,201 --> 00:35:17,561
bitch.

1242
00:35:17,561 --> 00:35:18,640
You gotta talk about it.

1243
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:19,250
And if you knew

1244
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,690
about it and you didn't
do anything about it,

1245
00:35:20,691 --> 00:35:21,550
that's incompetence.

1246
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,251
That's crazy.

1247
00:35:22,251 --> 00:35:23,450
If you let that fly,

1248
00:35:23,451 --> 00:35:24,860
if Obama let that fly,

1249
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:27,620
like that's one of the dumbest things
a president could ever approve ever.

1250
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:27,881
Sure.

1251
00:35:27,881 --> 00:35:28,581
What we should know,

1252
00:35:28,581 --> 00:35:29,840
we should know whether or not,

1253
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,560
especially in a time of a reelection when
that was going on and there's just no

1254
00:35:33,561 --> 00:35:35,150
way he shouldn't have to say,

1255
00:35:35,151 --> 00:35:36,920
well I thought it was a good idea at the,

1256
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,230
they assured me these guns

1257
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:39,040
would this fire,

1258
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:39,251
you know,

1259
00:35:39,251 --> 00:35:39,791
there was no,

1260
00:35:39,791 --> 00:35:40,390
there was no,

1261
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:43,360
or like Romney's tax
returns like that shit.

1262
00:35:43,361 --> 00:35:46,330
Like that kind of information
should be all on the table.

1263
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:46,751
Yeah.

1264
00:35:46,751 --> 00:35:47,650
You should know how much

1265
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,010
she paid in taxes because
you know how rich he is.

1266
00:35:50,011 --> 00:35:53,100
And if you really did weasel it out and
then the last couple of years decided to

1267
00:35:53,101 --> 00:35:54,690
start paying a lot of taxes to,

1268
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:55,883
to show,

1269
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:56,150
you know,

1270
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,150
so he had it on paper.

1271
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:58,960
If you're running for
the office like that.

1272
00:35:58,961 --> 00:35:59,111
Yeah.

1273
00:35:59,111 --> 00:36:00,970
I mean that's that the idea is,

1274
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:01,900
you know,

1275
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:04,240
to change this fucking businessman,

1276
00:36:04,241 --> 00:36:06,730
president and delight
public servant President.

1277
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:07,080
That's,

1278
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,320
that's the idea that you want.

1279
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,330
You want the fucking guy like runs.

1280
00:36:10,331 --> 00:36:11,230
Cost Guard is set.

1281
00:36:11,231 --> 00:36:12,460
Rather than saw this thing on Reddit,

1282
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:17,530
the guy who runs Costco pays his
employees like $18 an hour minimum.

1283
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:20,890
They have health insurance and
he only makes $500,000 a year.

1284
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:23,680
This is the guy who fucking runs Costco.

1285
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:24,760
Like think about that.

1286
00:36:24,761 --> 00:36:25,121
Meanwhile,

1287
00:36:25,121 --> 00:36:29,320
the guy who runs Walmart is like something
out of fucking pink Floyd the wall.

1288
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:31,300
He's just some a pig man.

1289
00:36:31,301 --> 00:36:32,134
He's like,

1290
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,310
Aye.

1291
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:35,561
You know what I mean?

1292
00:36:35,561 --> 00:36:36,460
It's crazy.

1293
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:37,271
It's crazy.

1294
00:36:37,271 --> 00:36:38,470
But that's the shift,

1295
00:36:38,471 --> 00:36:38,860
man.

1296
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:42,370
We want more things shifting to that so
that you get the Costco version of the

1297
00:36:42,371 --> 00:36:43,151
fucking president.

1298
00:36:43,151 --> 00:36:43,541
That's like,

1299
00:36:43,541 --> 00:36:44,050
yeah.

1300
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:44,321
You know,

1301
00:36:44,321 --> 00:36:46,840
I'm really just in this because
I'm trying to make this,

1302
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:51,850
this country prosperous and the people
in this country have as much access to

1303
00:36:51,851 --> 00:36:54,850
like healthcare and what they
need to live really great lives.

1304
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,860
So more Richard Branson,

1305
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,200
less less Rupert Murdoch.

1306
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:00,150
Yes.

1307
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:02,580
These old fucking warlock pigs,

1308
00:37:02,581 --> 00:37:03,180
man.

1309
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,770
Drive them into the shadows.

1310
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,770
Warlock pigs.

1311
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:09,990
That'd be an awesome name for a band.

1312
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:12,180
Warlock pigs.

1313
00:37:12,181 --> 00:37:12,570
Yeah,

1314
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:12,841
man,

1315
00:37:12,841 --> 00:37:15,120
we need more Branson's
interstellar travel.

1316
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,130
We need more fucking Steve Jobs.

1317
00:37:17,131 --> 00:37:17,461
You know,

1318
00:37:17,461 --> 00:37:20,930
we need more fucking like more of that
running the show and I think that's going

1319
00:37:20,931 --> 00:37:21,960
to happen more and more.

1320
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:26,270
Well you know what I'm really impressed
with when you talk to people that work

1321
00:37:26,271 --> 00:37:27,104
for Google,

1322
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:29,690
when you talk to people that work for
Google and they tell you what a great

1323
00:37:29,691 --> 00:37:32,720
company is to work for it and how
well they're treated and like the the

1324
00:37:32,721 --> 00:37:33,770
facilities are there.

1325
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:34,401
Campus,

1326
00:37:34,401 --> 00:37:35,500
I guess they call it a campus.

1327
00:37:35,501 --> 00:37:36,080
Yes.

1328
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:36,770
You know,

1329
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:40,070
you hear those kinds of stories like you
know that it's possible that a company

1330
00:37:40,071 --> 00:37:40,904
can operate like that.

1331
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,200
Dude,

1332
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,190
any kind of super,

1333
00:37:42,191 --> 00:37:44,860
anyone who's plugging into this
vibe that's happening right now,

1334
00:37:44,861 --> 00:37:46,210
whatever the fuck this thing is,

1335
00:37:46,211 --> 00:37:46,481
man,

1336
00:37:46,481 --> 00:37:50,140
you know right away that's all about
connectivity and you know right away that

1337
00:37:50,141 --> 00:37:54,820
the feeling you get from like giving
more than you're supposed to give is such

1338
00:37:54,821 --> 00:37:57,130
an awesome feeling and that feeling,

1339
00:37:57,250 --> 00:38:00,250
that state of mind where you're putting
out more than you're supposed to be

1340
00:38:00,251 --> 00:38:01,060
putting out,

1341
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:05,290
it seems like in that state of mind is
where the bigger ideas come from anyway.

1342
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:10,320
It's like that's creating a fertile ground
and your consciousness to open up for

1343
00:38:10,811 --> 00:38:12,400
like the big ideas,

1344
00:38:12,401 --> 00:38:13,690
but if you're shut down,

1345
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,800
closed down,

1346
00:38:14,801 --> 00:38:15,760
if you're fucking,

1347
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:16,390
if you're,

1348
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:18,970
if you're just one big human muscle spasm,

1349
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:22,690
pushing all your gyms into the
black pit of the your life,

1350
00:38:22,691 --> 00:38:22,961
you know,

1351
00:38:22,961 --> 00:38:25,210
hoarding and hiding and concealing,

1352
00:38:25,211 --> 00:38:26,620
then you're shut down.

1353
00:38:26,621 --> 00:38:29,800
That's when you turn into Donald
Trump with his dumb ass tweets

1354
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:35,080
who sillier than that guy.

1355
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:35,810
I just,

1356
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:36,020
you

1357
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:36,950
pay attention to that shit,

1358
00:38:36,951 --> 00:38:37,784
Brian.

1359
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:38,181
Yeah,

1360
00:38:38,181 --> 00:38:39,200
I don't like the guy anymore.

1361
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:40,220
I used to like him a lot,

1362
00:38:40,221 --> 00:38:42,560
but he just seems like
it's a crazy kook now.

1363
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:42,981
Yeah.

1364
00:38:42,981 --> 00:38:43,311
Right.

1365
00:38:43,311 --> 00:38:44,111
Like something happens.

1366
00:38:44,111 --> 00:38:45,350
Something like he shifted.

1367
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,060
Is that try water.

1368
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:49,030
Thanks the way we have everything set up.

1369
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:49,953
This is stupid.

1370
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,580
I know.

1371
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,480
I'm gonna see you sweetie.

1372
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,170
We should put a TV on the
other side of this monitor.

1373
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,073
Yeah.

1374
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,910
You could be making funny faces at me.

1375
00:38:59,911 --> 00:39:00,744
I wouldn't even know.

1376
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,333
How dare you.

1377
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:05,240
We're still working this place
out ladies and gentlemen.

1378
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:06,693
Um,

1379
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,950
my mic sounds weird.

1380
00:39:07,951 --> 00:39:09,000
It sounds like I'm a robot.

1381
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,060
Sounds fine.

1382
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:10,240
Dot.

1383
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:10,590
That sounds.

1384
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:10,891
Sounds,

1385
00:39:10,891 --> 00:39:11,724
it sounds okay to you.

1386
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:15,010
The Lakers knowing that
you don't like them,

1387
00:39:15,011 --> 00:39:16,330
but you're wearing their headsets.

1388
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:22,140
They're getting mad and are all Skullcandy
gave us these are there thanks called

1389
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:23,530
candy.

1390
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:25,060
Did you have the bill
burr ones down there?

1391
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:26,110
Bill Baer ones?

1392
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:26,531
Oh yeah.

1393
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:27,364
In a box itself.

1394
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:30,900
Celtics.

1395
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,180
Uh,

1396
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:31,370

1397
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:33,330
they have them I guess
for basically every,

1398
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:34,880
are these good headsets man.

1399
00:39:34,881 --> 00:39:34,991
I've,

1400
00:39:34,991 --> 00:39:35,200
I've,

1401
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,160
I've been real close to forking out.

1402
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:38,960
I'll give you a pair of these.

1403
00:39:38,961 --> 00:39:40,880
I've got awesome.

1404
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:41,500
Yeah.

1405
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,500
I'll Skullcandy has been
sending them to us 40 bucks.

1406
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:44,801
Yeah,

1407
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:45,370
they're expensive.

1408
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:46,090
They're good though.

1409
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:48,010
These they sound fucking wicked.

1410
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:48,640
Yeah,

1411
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,121
they uh,

1412
00:39:49,121 --> 00:39:51,610
they sent me this whole
email explaining how they,

1413
00:39:51,611 --> 00:39:51,850
uh,

1414
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:55,420
spent a lot of money on
research and development to
try to make like really good

1415
00:39:55,421 --> 00:39:58,150
sounding ones that initially they
were more of like a lifestyle company.

1416
00:39:58,151 --> 00:39:59,170
They had like good ones,

1417
00:39:59,171 --> 00:40:03,280
but now they're concentrated on really
creating like something that like a Dj

1418
00:40:03,281 --> 00:40:04,330
would listen with.

1419
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:09,500
I leave fucking ear buds scattered
across this fucking country like spider

1420
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,330
threat and chargers,

1421
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,430
chargers in fucking ear buds.

1422
00:40:13,431 --> 00:40:14,091
Everywhere I go.

1423
00:40:14,091 --> 00:40:16,040
Trail on rights and sunglasses.

1424
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:19,190
I lost my Goddamn I pad.

1425
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,530
I lost my fucking digital recorder.

1426
00:40:21,531 --> 00:40:26,060
I'm like a fucking a 11 year old would
like bad add at a summer camp on this

1427
00:40:26,061 --> 00:40:26,871
last tour I did.

1428
00:40:26,871 --> 00:40:27,980
I left shit everywhere.

1429
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:29,330
Well See,

1430
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:30,163
first of all

1431
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,920
saying this last tour,

1432
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:38,600
whenever you go on tour man,

1433
00:40:38,601 --> 00:40:41,000
like you're going from one
hotel room to another hotel.

1434
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:43,100
You're lucky if you keep 80% of your shit.

1435
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,470
It's amazing how much you lose dude.

1436
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:47,010
It's amazing.

1437
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,230
Do you feel bad?

1438
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:50,310
Not that I do this,

1439
00:40:50,311 --> 00:40:51,480
but I think you might do it.

1440
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:52,590
Do you like?

1441
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:54,060
Do you feel guilty when you,

1442
00:40:54,061 --> 00:40:59,061
like when you like Jizz in a hotel room
and like what do you throw the tissue

1443
00:40:59,311 --> 00:40:59,611
down?

1444
00:40:59,611 --> 00:41:02,740
Have you ever done that and you realize
you will have to fuck what are you wipe

1445
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:03,583
it in?

1446
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:05,423
Do you feel bad?

1447
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:12,180
But you know what I mean?

1448
00:41:12,181 --> 00:41:13,890
Like I feel bad for the maids man.

1449
00:41:13,891 --> 00:41:14,400
Like,

1450
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,930
like all the fuck hit them.

1451
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,160
The maids.

1452
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,570
I just started fucking
tip in the movie too.

1453
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,330
I didn't even know you
were supposed to do that.

1454
00:41:21,331 --> 00:41:23,100
I that's something I just woke up too.

1455
00:41:23,101 --> 00:41:23,491
Yeah.

1456
00:41:23,491 --> 00:41:24,300
I like,

1457
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,800
yeah I just started doing that.

1458
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,200
But unfortunately for many,

1459
00:41:28,201 --> 00:41:33,110
many maids if like had to pick up a
crusty old thing and like they them

1460
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:34,370
sucked on the Napkins.

1461
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,133
A

1462
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:42,080
gemara model now taking
your salty that's what they,

1463
00:41:42,081 --> 00:41:43,340
that's what they feed on.

1464
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:43,531
Yeah.

1465
00:41:43,531 --> 00:41:44,364
Like a Gnat.

1466
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,480
Washcloth just sucking on the washcloth,

1467
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,221
fight over them.

1468
00:41:47,221 --> 00:41:51,260
I'm in the bathroom and she doesn't know
that you used your keys to get back in

1469
00:41:51,261 --> 00:41:53,690
because she didn't hear the door open
cause she's making that sucking noise.

1470
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:55,690
Bang.

1471
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:56,690
She's like on top of it,

1472
00:41:56,691 --> 00:41:59,070
like a praying mantis
eating a fucking bomb.

1473
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:02,480
Pirates slowly starting to
bring color back to her face.

1474
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:06,290
God vampires were so close
to being awesome man.

1475
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:07,480
If only they want to just,

1476
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:09,470
well that would be the sucky best.

1477
00:42:09,471 --> 00:42:12,440
It would be attached to your
dick and balls with like knife,

1478
00:42:12,441 --> 00:42:16,370
like teeth so that you were scared to
move so you lay there and terror and you

1479
00:42:16,371 --> 00:42:21,180
would just shoot a load out of pure fear
and they would just keep it and they

1480
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,340
wouldn't let you pull it out.

1481
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:24,020
He's done.

1482
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:27,270
You know that feeling like after you
come where you want to like somebody

1483
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:31,540
touches your Dick like hey I like it
tickles almost like it's too crazy blow

1484
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:32,403
job.

1485
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:37,490
If a giant sucky booths with teeth is
attaching itself to the head of your Dick

1486
00:42:37,491 --> 00:42:40,220
and suck on it and you
can't pull your Dick back.

1487
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:43,520
Cause if you do it gets shredded and you
feel the Stinger on your neck kind of

1488
00:42:43,521 --> 00:42:44,510
push in a little bit.

1489
00:42:44,511 --> 00:42:44,930
Yeah,

1490
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:46,170
he started struggling too much.

1491
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,360
Giant Stinger like a,

1492
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:50,480
like a scorpion like comes
over the top of your head.

1493
00:42:50,481 --> 00:42:54,500
So while you're blowing
it wide sucking your Dick,

1494
00:42:54,501 --> 00:42:54,671
it's,

1495
00:42:54,671 --> 00:42:58,880
its Stinger is like attached to your
spine and you're looking at in this weird

1496
00:42:58,881 --> 00:42:59,181
cave,

1497
00:42:59,181 --> 00:43:03,320
it's dragged you into it and it's just
all like whether dude corpses and maybe a

1498
00:43:03,321 --> 00:43:07,180
couple of guys still alive and the
Stinger has two vice like tentacles and

1499
00:43:07,181 --> 00:43:09,200
either side of that
clamp down on your neck.

1500
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:12,230
So right before it pushes
that sting against your spine.

1501
00:43:12,231 --> 00:43:14,710
Those things get tighter and
tighter and you just feel it,

1502
00:43:14,711 --> 00:43:15,290
you know,

1503
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:16,041
don't go anywhere.

1504
00:43:16,041 --> 00:43:19,760
I'm sucking your deck and this
is going to go on for five years.

1505
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:20,900
Giant teeth.

1506
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:25,940
I never pictured them at like that.

1507
00:43:25,941 --> 00:43:27,230
Like when I think of a sack of us,

1508
00:43:27,231 --> 00:43:30,860
I think a world of Warcraft is fucking
hot chick with like leather boots,

1509
00:43:30,861 --> 00:43:34,100
like a dominatrix or the
little whip that like you know,

1510
00:43:34,101 --> 00:43:35,090
over fuck to you.

1511
00:43:35,091 --> 00:43:39,320
But if it starts out as a beautiful girl
and then you realize in the middle of

1512
00:43:39,321 --> 00:43:40,210
having sex with it,

1513
00:43:40,211 --> 00:43:42,800
like sort of like Jack Nicholson when
he was making out with that lady and the

1514
00:43:42,801 --> 00:43:46,460
shining and then all sudden she was
like a hundred years old with cancer all

1515
00:43:46,461 --> 00:43:47,294
over her back.

1516
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:50,780
Maybe that's how it gets cone and maybe
it looks like Rose McGowan and then you

1517
00:43:50,781 --> 00:43:51,920
move in for the kill.

1518
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:55,190
You start squeezing her ass and all of
a sudden she morphs into this thing.

1519
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:56,361
Yeah,

1520
00:43:56,361 --> 00:43:57,051
just your,

1521
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:57,800
you can't move.

1522
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,110
I think that's why I have to hold your
neck and then it starts talking to you

1523
00:44:00,111 --> 00:44:00,430
off.

1524
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:00,740
Yeah.

1525
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:01,850
I think that's the story.

1526
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:04,040
Fucking wives man.

1527
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:04,730
It is.

1528
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:06,200
And it always starts off like that.

1529
00:44:06,201 --> 00:44:06,831
Next thing you know,

1530
00:44:06,831 --> 00:44:10,520
you're over your clamped in to some
kind of that to me it's a symbol,

1531
00:44:10,521 --> 00:44:10,821
you know,

1532
00:44:10,821 --> 00:44:11,301
it's like that.

1533
00:44:11,301 --> 00:44:16,010
Oh the sirens that like seeing in the
sailors crashed their ships on the island

1534
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:16,850
and you know,

1535
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:18,590
it's all the same fucking story.

1536
00:44:18,591 --> 00:44:19,280
Right?

1537
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,930
How come guys don't see those in prison?

1538
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:21,800
Like,

1539
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,980
you know some girl with like fake girl
with a key that's going to let you out.

1540
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:25,430
Do you,

1541
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:27,830
you never hear of like crazy
hallucinations in prison?

1542
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:29,720
I don't know about that.

1543
00:44:29,721 --> 00:44:29,861
I'm,

1544
00:44:29,861 --> 00:44:32,670
I'm pretty sure there's some pretty
crazy illuminations in prison.

1545
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:32,821
Yeah.

1546
00:44:32,821 --> 00:44:35,480
But I mean like that kind of
reoccurring theme of like a,

1547
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,050
someone with a light
near the rock's going,

1548
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:39,000
come on over here.

1549
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,040
I own a sailor's smashed into the rock.

1550
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:45,390
So the prison harpies there's prison
harpies man I called trainees.

1551
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:49,140
We had 'em

1552
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:50,190
Victor Conte on,

1553
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:53,790
he was telling us about his time in a
minimum security prison where you were

1554
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:55,740
allowed like really allowed
to leave whenever you want.

1555
00:44:55,741 --> 00:44:56,910
Like people would come and pick up their,

1556
00:44:57,090 --> 00:45:00,330
their family like Elana stay there a
certain amount of time you could get like

1557
00:45:00,331 --> 00:45:01,164
passes to leave.

1558
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,540
He said that the security guards,

1559
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:05,160
like there was a girl security guard.

1560
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:07,410
They would make money
prostituting herself.

1561
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:07,980
Yeah.

1562
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:10,290
Like you could go get some
head from the security guard.

1563
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:11,870
She made a lot of extra money that way.

1564
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:12,820
It makes sense to me.

1565
00:45:12,821 --> 00:45:14,230
These poor bastard Italian,

1566
00:45:14,231 --> 00:45:15,520
but not going to let these guys,

1567
00:45:15,521 --> 00:45:16,211
fuck man.

1568
00:45:16,211 --> 00:45:17,530
That's why there's so many problems.

1569
00:45:17,531 --> 00:45:17,650
It's,

1570
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:18,251
it's awesome,

1571
00:45:18,251 --> 00:45:18,431
man.

1572
00:45:18,431 --> 00:45:20,350
I would add that to the
God damn constitution.

1573
00:45:20,351 --> 00:45:20,891
If you're in prison,

1574
00:45:20,891 --> 00:45:22,660
you get a blow job a month just to,

1575
00:45:22,661 --> 00:45:23,020
because

1576
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,960
you got to be around some crazy
fucking people that want to kill women.

1577
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:30,080
What if you're around some really crazy
serial murderer character and someone's

1578
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:30,923
got to suck his dick?

1579
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:32,530
Who's job should that be?

1580
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:33,060
I mean

1581
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:34,550
another serial murderer.

1582
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:36,170
A guy.

1583
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:36,441
Yeah,

1584
00:45:36,441 --> 00:45:36,891
whatever.

1585
00:45:36,891 --> 00:45:37,191
Dude,

1586
00:45:37,191 --> 00:45:37,571
who cares?

1587
00:45:37,571 --> 00:45:38,960
This is a fucking hole in the wall.

1588
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,250
You know what's on the other end?

1589
00:45:40,251 --> 00:45:43,850
It's like you make it very like dad's
guys would bite each other's dicks off.

1590
00:45:43,851 --> 00:45:46,130
There's no way you fucking Defang them.

1591
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:48,920
You can't Defang a guy
cause he's on the other end.

1592
00:45:48,921 --> 00:45:49,830
If he grabs a hold of it,

1593
00:45:49,831 --> 00:45:52,070
she said he just pulls
it out with his hands.

1594
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,870
I haven't perfected this system yet,

1595
00:45:53,871 --> 00:45:54,740
but I'm working on it.

1596
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:56,810
But because if he couldn't
blow you with his hands,

1597
00:45:56,950 --> 00:45:59,500
be an inferior blowjob moving
through a hole in the wall,

1598
00:45:59,501 --> 00:45:59,940
you can feel like,

1599
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:00,773
what the fuck?

1600
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:03,850
Let me just take it down from
this disgusting level it's gotten.

1601
00:46:03,851 --> 00:46:06,630
If you heard about the new program
where they give prisoners kittens,

1602
00:46:06,631 --> 00:46:07,411
if you heard about this.

1603
00:46:07,411 --> 00:46:07,631
Yeah,

1604
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:08,190
I have heard.

1605
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:09,160
And it makes them like,

1606
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:10,920
what's that?

1607
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:11,910
What's a good way a cat?

1608
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:16,050
And so sat down to two of my pets.

1609
00:46:16,051 --> 00:46:17,340
I have one left dude.

1610
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:17,600
Um,

1611
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:17,851
yeah,

1612
00:46:17,851 --> 00:46:18,481
it's really cool.

1613
00:46:18,481 --> 00:46:18,901
But it's like,

1614
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:23,640
just like having these fucking cats is
changing the prisoner's behavior and

1615
00:46:23,641 --> 00:46:24,570
massive ways,

1616
00:46:24,571 --> 00:46:24,781
man,

1617
00:46:24,781 --> 00:46:26,760
because they know that
if they get in fights,

1618
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:30,040
they lose their cat so they don't
want to fucking lose the cat.

1619
00:46:30,041 --> 00:46:30,874
So it's like,

1620
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,210
it creates this like it,

1621
00:46:32,211 --> 00:46:33,570
it adds piece.

1622
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:35,310
You've got to bring love into prison.

1623
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:36,190
That's a problem,

1624
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:36,451
man.

1625
00:46:36,451 --> 00:46:37,770
Love is the answer.

1626
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:39,063
Brother.

1627
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:47,190
With a little fucking kitten can transform
some hardcore thug and to somebody

1628
00:46:47,191 --> 00:46:47,401
who's like,

1629
00:46:47,401 --> 00:46:47,610
you know,

1630
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:50,640
I'm not going to fight because princess
is back in the saddle and I don't want

1631
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:51,474
to lose her.

1632
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:52,201
That's love,

1633
00:46:52,201 --> 00:46:52,471
man.

1634
00:46:52,471 --> 00:46:53,510
That's the most powerful thing.

1635
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,900
It's a lot more powerful than being like,

1636
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:55,110
oh,

1637
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:56,130
we'll put you in solitary.

1638
00:46:56,131 --> 00:46:56,791
Can Fuck you.

1639
00:46:56,791 --> 00:46:57,270
Fuck up.

1640
00:46:57,270 --> 00:47:00,420
How many of these guys are actually
fucking the cat though a lot.

1641
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:01,351
Most of them,

1642
00:47:01,351 --> 00:47:02,184
right?

1643
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:02,930
Yeah.

1644
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:05,340
Maybe the cat is like
a special attachment.

1645
00:47:05,341 --> 00:47:09,930
When you stick your Dick in its ass and
alarm goes off you to the RFID chip,

1646
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:11,910
you push,

1647
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:14,640
you push the button when your
cock to try to fuck a cat,

1648
00:47:14,641 --> 00:47:15,770
you're not going to have a fucking cat.

1649
00:47:15,771 --> 00:47:18,480
It's like they probably do an operation
on the cap where there's like,

1650
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:22,080
there's like a little toggle and as long
as the poops going that way it passes

1651
00:47:22,081 --> 00:47:22,620
the toggle.

1652
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:23,453
It doesn't go off.

1653
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:24,900
But if a dick goes in the other way,

1654
00:47:24,930 --> 00:47:29,920
click it hits the switch and then the
RFID chips signals the alarm as a cat.

1655
00:47:29,921 --> 00:47:31,270
That's a fleshlight in prison.

1656
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:32,231
Yeah,

1657
00:47:32,231 --> 00:47:33,064
they would fuck that guy.

1658
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:34,260
I think prisoners,

1659
00:47:34,261 --> 00:47:35,230
staff flashlights,

1660
00:47:35,231 --> 00:47:35,441
man.

1661
00:47:35,441 --> 00:47:39,790
I don't know why we're acting like it's
going to do anything good to like try to

1662
00:47:39,791 --> 00:47:41,660
like change someones libido.

1663
00:47:41,661 --> 00:47:42,850
Who's in a cage.

1664
00:47:42,851 --> 00:47:46,930
Like that's not going to add
happiness to a prison or peacefulness.

1665
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:48,850
Everyone you look at these
prison riots are like,

1666
00:47:48,851 --> 00:47:50,610
why are they writing to?

1667
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:51,011
They're not,

1668
00:47:51,011 --> 00:47:51,940
they're not fucking,

1669
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:55,750
these guys have so much testosterone
and then you're not letting them fuck.

1670
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:55,981
Yeah,

1671
00:47:55,981 --> 00:47:56,530
but even if you

1672
00:47:56,530 --> 00:47:57,363
give him flashlights,

1673
00:47:57,370 --> 00:47:58,810
so it's not as good as raping a guy.

1674
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:01,300
That's part of the fun for them.

1675
00:48:01,301 --> 00:48:03,120
I think it's holding someone down and,

1676
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:04,600
and getting that man pussy,

1677
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:05,231
you know?

1678
00:48:05,231 --> 00:48:05,811
I mean when,

1679
00:48:05,811 --> 00:48:06,940
when they're turning out to each other,

1680
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:08,560
that's part of what they're doing.

1681
00:48:08,561 --> 00:48:08,810
Okay.

1682
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:09,643
No disagree.

1683
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:14,950
[inaudible] way you phrase that.

1684
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:22,090
I'd like to be punched in
the face and a flashlight.

1685
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:23,171
Yeah,

1686
00:48:23,171 --> 00:48:24,004
no shit man.

1687
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:24,851
Dude.

1688
00:48:24,851 --> 00:48:27,960
I saw a terrifying thing ever seen
that thing of that dude is like the,

1689
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,430
like the toughest prisoner
and like Columbia.

1690
00:48:30,431 --> 00:48:31,360
Have you ever seen that thing?

1691
00:48:31,361 --> 00:48:32,194
And he's just like,

1692
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:32,600
yeah,

1693
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:33,700
that guy's a monster.

1694
00:48:33,701 --> 00:48:34,091
And he's like,

1695
00:48:34,091 --> 00:48:34,360
yeah,

1696
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,111
I make a man.

1697
00:48:35,111 --> 00:48:36,010
My girlfriend.

1698
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:37,450
I let him sleep in my bed.

1699
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:38,531
What is it?

1700
00:48:38,531 --> 00:48:38,891
He says,

1701
00:48:38,891 --> 00:48:39,260
it's like,

1702
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:40,093
really?

1703
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:40,610
I give,

1704
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:42,970
I take sex from him if not a kill him.

1705
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:43,870
Yeah.

1706
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:44,950
I give him my food.

1707
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:45,281
Yeah.

1708
00:48:45,281 --> 00:48:46,960
It's really dark African guy.

1709
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:47,370
Yes.

1710
00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:47,951
I fucked him.

1711
00:48:47,951 --> 00:48:48,390
A new guy.

1712
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:48,661
Come.

1713
00:48:48,661 --> 00:48:49,494
I fuck him.

1714
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:50,501
Fuck him.

1715
00:48:50,501 --> 00:48:51,340
I have sex with him.

1716
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:52,000
Yeah.

1717
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:52,620
Yeah,

1718
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:53,453
that well that,

1719
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:53,741
yeah,

1720
00:48:53,741 --> 00:48:53,891
that,

1721
00:48:53,891 --> 00:48:54,640
that kind of shit.

1722
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:54,790
Right.

1723
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:55,870
If you find that pull,

1724
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:57,940
pull that up because it's
just the audio alone.

1725
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:58,833
It's like scary.

1726
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:02,490
Most evil prisoner of all
time or something is what
it's called or just beast.

1727
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:05,410
Prisoner man might knock us off line,

1728
00:49:05,411 --> 00:49:06,244
but I'll try.

1729
00:49:06,370 --> 00:49:07,203
Yeah.

1730
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,970
Sense of bitch and I just looked,

1731
00:49:08,971 --> 00:49:09,641
you might be right.

1732
00:49:09,641 --> 00:49:10,630
There might be nothing here.

1733
00:49:10,631 --> 00:49:12,460
I just looked on this website
that checks everything.

1734
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:13,601
Checks everything.

1735
00:49:13,601 --> 00:49:13,940
What?

1736
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:14,620
Like Internet.

1737
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:14,950
Yeah.

1738
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:15,700
No,

1739
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:16,533
trust me.

1740
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:18,283
You're hiding.

1741
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:18,960
We're in the,

1742
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:19,830
we're in the woods.

1743
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:20,670
Oh yeah.

1744
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:22,020
We're in the woods of discovery.

1745
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:23,910
We're going to get it worked out.

1746
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:24,863
This sucks,

1747
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:26,940
but it's online and the,

1748
00:49:26,941 --> 00:49:27,330
uh,

1749
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:28,170
I'm looking at the video.

1750
00:49:28,171 --> 00:49:28,921
It's not that bad.

1751
00:49:28,921 --> 00:49:29,754
It's working,

1752
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,200
but most importantly,

1753
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,210
it's just got to go through a process.

1754
00:49:33,211 --> 00:49:34,590
This whole thing's
going through a process.

1755
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:34,980
That's part,

1756
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:35,731
it's exciting to me.

1757
00:49:35,731 --> 00:49:37,080
I've never built anything before.

1758
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:41,430
I've never liked slowly started and sort
of organize and put it together and to

1759
00:49:41,431 --> 00:49:42,300
have it the way I want it.

1760
00:49:42,301 --> 00:49:42,570
Like,

1761
00:49:42,570 --> 00:49:43,950
I love that having the brick wall,

1762
00:49:43,951 --> 00:49:45,030
like a real brick wall.

1763
00:49:45,031 --> 00:49:46,320
I love the Oak table.

1764
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:47,580
These lovely early days.

1765
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:47,881
Yeah,

1766
00:49:47,881 --> 00:49:48,330
this is,

1767
00:49:48,330 --> 00:49:49,020
but I love,

1768
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:51,150
I love like real shit like that.

1769
00:49:51,151 --> 00:49:52,650
Bricks and wood.

1770
00:49:52,651 --> 00:49:53,431
It makes me feel good.

1771
00:49:53,431 --> 00:49:53,800
That stuff.

1772
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,200
That's the kind of like metal,

1773
00:49:55,201 --> 00:49:56,310
like cast iron,

1774
00:49:56,311 --> 00:49:56,820
like these,

1775
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:57,790
these legs and shit.

1776
00:49:57,791 --> 00:49:58,950
The Werewolf sculpture.

1777
00:49:58,980 --> 00:49:59,150
Yeah,

1778
00:49:59,150 --> 00:49:59,983
that too.

1779
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:00,631
Perfect.

1780
00:50:00,631 --> 00:50:02,060
I'm going to bring one of my boot into,

1781
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:02,960
yeah.

1782
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,090
Buddhist going to rocket in the corner
and just watch over the old one.

1783
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:07,440
Not The big one.

1784
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:10,350
It's too hard to move the
big ones too hard to move,

1785
00:50:10,351 --> 00:50:11,700
but I've got another one
that's pretty big too.

1786
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:12,923
It's going to go here.

1787
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:13,381
Cool.

1788
00:50:13,381 --> 00:50:14,850
Match over us back.

1789
00:50:14,851 --> 00:50:16,020
Ingestions what else do I do?

1790
00:50:16,021 --> 00:50:16,854
This place

1791
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:19,250
fucking have a float tank.

1792
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:19,911
Yeah,

1793
00:50:19,911 --> 00:50:20,390
but that's,

1794
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:21,020
no one's going to,

1795
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:21,450
what are you going to do?

1796
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:23,630
I'm going to have some going on there
and they're going to be annoying.

1797
00:50:23,631 --> 00:50:23,910
Yeah,

1798
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:24,290
man.

1799
00:50:24,290 --> 00:50:27,000
Float tank and then you give
your pals keys to this place.

1800
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:28,250
They can come out here and float.

1801
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:28,880
Yeah,

1802
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,830
come back or just go to
the float was everywhere.

1803
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:34,310
Whereas Float Lab Dunkin was here
written in blood on the wall.

1804
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:35,361
Oh yeah,

1805
00:50:35,361 --> 00:50:35,871
that guy did.

1806
00:50:35,871 --> 00:50:36,290
I would,

1807
00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:37,580
I would waste blood on

1808
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:40,310
maybe a little period blood.

1809
00:50:40,311 --> 00:50:40,700
You won't.

1810
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:41,510
Who knows?

1811
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:44,990
Have you seen this blood blood
bricks that they can make now?

1812
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:45,471
It's a,

1813
00:50:45,471 --> 00:50:49,610
it's a brick that they take blood and
they mix it with something and it makes a

1814
00:50:49,611 --> 00:50:52,250
brick and they're making
houses out of these outbreaks.

1815
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,390
Oh my God.

1816
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:54,111
That's great.

1817
00:50:54,111 --> 00:50:54,944
Who's blind?

1818
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:55,461
Uh,

1819
00:50:55,461 --> 00:50:56,120
I don't know.

1820
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,370
How do you know there's not a couple
of people mixed in your house?

1821
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:58,580
Right?

1822
00:50:58,580 --> 00:50:58,730
Well,

1823
00:50:58,730 --> 00:50:58,911
no,

1824
00:50:58,911 --> 00:50:59,361
that's cool.

1825
00:50:59,361 --> 00:51:00,051
I'll tell you this.

1826
00:51:00,051 --> 00:51:01,070
If I was going to die,

1827
00:51:01,071 --> 00:51:04,430
I wouldn't mind somebody with drawing my
blood and using it for blood bricks for

1828
00:51:04,431 --> 00:51:05,264
their house.

1829
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:08,630
Would you rather that
or Tibetans Sky Funeral,

1830
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:09,230
Skype?

1831
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:09,381
Well,

1832
00:51:09,381 --> 00:51:09,651
no,

1833
00:51:09,651 --> 00:51:12,800
both turn my blood and the bricks
and let the buzzards eat me.

1834
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:15,403
Oh,

1835
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,810
well you can probably grind most
of you and turn it into bricks.

1836
00:51:17,811 --> 00:51:17,991
Why?

1837
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:18,201
Why?

1838
00:51:18,201 --> 00:51:19,190
Just fuck with the blood?

1839
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:19,730
I don't know.

1840
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:20,850
I know you just had blood bricks.

1841
00:51:20,851 --> 00:51:21,360
I wouldn't know.

1842
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:26,200
I like I that whole idea of like the way
we do death in this country is so god

1843
00:51:26,201 --> 00:51:26,931
damn sterile.

1844
00:51:26,931 --> 00:51:27,591
I'm fucked up.

1845
00:51:27,591 --> 00:51:28,400
What's a scam?

1846
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:28,881
First of all,

1847
00:51:28,881 --> 00:51:29,460
those guys

1848
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:32,930
gamma's that you have to pay for the
funeral and then it's really expensive and

1849
00:51:32,931 --> 00:51:36,090
you know you have to pay a lot of money
for a casket and you have to embalm the

1850
00:51:36,091 --> 00:51:36,810
body.

1851
00:51:36,810 --> 00:51:37,640
Even if you're going to,

1852
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,450
they have it set up with
the body gets involved.

1853
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:42,420
I believe even if it gets cremated,

1854
00:51:42,421 --> 00:51:44,190
I think you still have to embalm the body.

1855
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:45,240
I think that's the law

1856
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:46,150
dude,

1857
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:46,931
that Tibetans,

1858
00:51:46,931 --> 00:51:49,990
Scott ritual is such a
beautiful fucking thing man.

1859
00:51:49,991 --> 00:51:52,330
When you watch someone
turn into a bunch of birds,

1860
00:51:52,331 --> 00:51:54,300
that's really cool to watch that happen.

1861
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:55,270
You guys have wills?

1862
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:57,010
I don't.

1863
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:57,933
Yeah,

1864
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:58,511
I need one.

1865
00:51:58,511 --> 00:51:59,171
Do you know if you,

1866
00:51:59,171 --> 00:52:00,430
if you don't have a will,

1867
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:02,230
I think I'm not 100% sure,

1868
00:52:02,231 --> 00:52:04,180
but like the government
just takes all your shit.

1869
00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:07,060
Even if you have living
parents and another state.

1870
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:07,451
I got to get a,

1871
00:52:07,451 --> 00:52:08,250
well

1872
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,083
that's true.

1873
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:12,150
I think it goes to the next of kin,

1874
00:52:12,270 --> 00:52:13,103
Joe.

1875
00:52:13,850 --> 00:52:14,130
Joe,

1876
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:15,390
if something happens to me,

1877
00:52:15,391 --> 00:52:15,751
dude,

1878
00:52:15,751 --> 00:52:17,610
you can have my little hub.

1879
00:52:17,611 --> 00:52:17,820
Oh.

1880
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:18,653
And my computer.

1881
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:19,201
I'll do,

1882
00:52:19,201 --> 00:52:19,980
that's all I want.

1883
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:21,030
I own two things.

1884
00:52:21,031 --> 00:52:21,720
That's all I want.

1885
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:22,553
I got pass again.

1886
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:23,430
You got to piss again.

1887
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:23,971
Oh my dude.

1888
00:52:23,971 --> 00:52:25,810
I drink so much coffee to Dan.

1889
00:52:25,811 --> 00:52:26,101
Go ahead.

1890
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:26,790
Go ahead.

1891
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:28,470
We don't have much time
left in this podcast,

1892
00:52:28,471 --> 00:52:30,060
unfortunately because,

1893
00:52:30,061 --> 00:52:30,420
uh,

1894
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:31,253
I got a big,

1895
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:33,120
stupid important meeting.

1896
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:34,123
Where's it at side?

1897
00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:35,750
Because that highway was fucked.

1898
00:52:35,751 --> 00:52:37,040
I don't know if you got my text message.

1899
00:52:37,041 --> 00:52:38,780
There was like five cars,

1900
00:52:38,781 --> 00:52:39,501
all cop cars.

1901
00:52:39,501 --> 00:52:42,410
It seemed like that guy in a car
accident and the whole freeway's closed.

1902
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:43,303
Which freeway?

1903
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:44,180
One one.

1904
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:44,451
Oh,

1905
00:52:44,451 --> 00:52:45,284
great.

1906
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,380
Woopsies oopsy daisy.

1907
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:48,741
Well,

1908
00:52:48,741 --> 00:52:49,574
I'll try,

1909
00:52:49,730 --> 00:52:50,563
I'll try.

1910
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:51,643
I'll try to make it,

1911
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:52,790
but if I don't make it,

1912
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,710
don't really give a fuck.

1913
00:52:56,910 --> 00:52:58,240
I hate to leave anybody hanging.

1914
00:52:58,250 --> 00:52:58,370
Yeah.

1915
00:52:58,370 --> 00:52:58,731
The more,

1916
00:52:58,731 --> 00:53:01,130
the more I think about
yesterday's podcast,

1917
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:05,860
I don't know if I want to say say it
the more I think that guy is tweaker.

1918
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:06,730
You think so?

1919
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:07,180
Yeah.

1920
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:09,610
Most people thought that
a lot of people who,

1921
00:53:09,611 --> 00:53:09,830
uh,

1922
00:53:09,830 --> 00:53:13,660
listen then thought he was off and
that he would like contradict himself.

1923
00:53:13,661 --> 00:53:16,720
And the fact that he knew
so much about those drugs,

1924
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:18,280
but yet there was a,

1925
00:53:18,350 --> 00:53:18,641
you know,

1926
00:53:18,641 --> 00:53:22,360
we read on Gizmodo that
they didn't cite sources,

1927
00:53:22,361 --> 00:53:22,871
but they said,

1928
00:53:22,871 --> 00:53:23,110
you know,

1929
00:53:23,110 --> 00:53:24,400
sources close to him.

1930
00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:28,090
Say that he's always been interested in
finding drugs that make women's sexual.

1931
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:32,150
It kinda goes along with
the whole 67 year old guy,

1932
00:53:32,151 --> 00:53:33,490
a 20 year old girlfriend thing.

1933
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:34,090
You know,

1934
00:53:34,090 --> 00:53:35,560
it sounds like a dude who's just,

1935
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:37,513
that's his thing.

1936
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:38,793
I don't know.

1937
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:39,441
I mean he,

1938
00:53:39,441 --> 00:53:40,300
he claims not,

1939
00:53:40,301 --> 00:53:40,930
but then he ought,

1940
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:42,880
but he knows so much about that man.

1941
00:53:42,910 --> 00:53:47,350
How the fuck do you know so much about
bath salts and MDPV and these different

1942
00:53:47,351 --> 00:53:52,030
hypersexual compounds and how could he
tell us the exact chemical composition of

1943
00:53:52,031 --> 00:53:52,120
it?

1944
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:52,953
Remember when he told us?

1945
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:54,220
But it wouldn't actually was,

1946
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:56,770
why would you say that unless you have
great interest in it and why would you

1947
00:53:56,771 --> 00:53:57,190
have graded?

1948
00:53:57,190 --> 00:53:58,330
And then the other thing was saying like,

1949
00:53:58,580 --> 00:53:59,770
I have to be addicted.

1950
00:54:00,110 --> 00:54:00,911
It can't do that.

1951
00:54:00,911 --> 00:54:02,980
Then I would be on it right now
and I sound like I don't on it.

1952
00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:04,660
He might be on it right now,

1953
00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:08,620
but I don't necessarily think that a
strong willed man like that has to be

1954
00:54:08,621 --> 00:54:09,160
addicted to.

1955
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:13,060
So it's supposedly really hypersexual.

1956
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:14,253
That's the thing.

1957
00:54:14,270 --> 00:54:15,460
But I figured that if you're a gun,

1958
00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:15,780
a gun,

1959
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:16,370
I'm like God,

1960
00:54:16,370 --> 00:54:17,203
like Mcafee,

1961
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:18,170
he's,

1962
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:18,551
you know,

1963
00:54:18,551 --> 00:54:19,780
he created this business.

1964
00:54:19,781 --> 00:54:21,520
He's like a very headstrong guy,

1965
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:22,810
very powerful guy.

1966
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:27,280
I kind of like that could probably quit
of really fucking dangerous drug for a

1967
00:54:27,281 --> 00:54:27,761
little bit.

1968
00:54:27,761 --> 00:54:28,270
Sure.

1969
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:28,571
You know,

1970
00:54:28,571 --> 00:54:29,020
he could,

1971
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:29,391
it's,

1972
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:31,930
it's hard to tell when
someone lies about anything.

1973
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:36,730
If they lie about anything or don't or
not completely honest about anything,

1974
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,650
you immediately have to look
at the whole thing and go,

1975
00:54:38,651 --> 00:54:38,891
well,

1976
00:54:38,891 --> 00:54:42,460
if he's not telling the truth about
doing those drugs and how can I listen to

1977
00:54:42,461 --> 00:54:43,000
all the other stuff?

1978
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:43,500
Yeah.

1979
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:44,333
It sounds,

1980
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:48,580
it sounds like it's a lot of who the fuck
knows what to believe at that at that

1981
00:54:48,581 --> 00:54:49,414
point,

1982
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:52,480
and the fact that he has no charges,

1983
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:55,200
nothing like on record like that.

1984
00:54:55,201 --> 00:54:57,190
Like there's no warrant for his arrest.

1985
00:54:57,191 --> 00:54:58,150
There's nothing,

1986
00:54:58,570 --> 00:55:01,300
it kind of made me think that
he was just super paranoid.

1987
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:01,971
Well,

1988
00:55:01,971 --> 00:55:02,810
it could be that.

1989
00:55:02,990 --> 00:55:03,830
It could be that,

1990
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:04,191
you know,

1991
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:04,790
I mean,

1992
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:08,930
I told you there was that
story that someone had said
that he thought that there

1993
00:55:08,931 --> 00:55:11,690
was people outside and
he had a conversation.

1994
00:55:11,691 --> 00:55:12,290
I heard this,

1995
00:55:12,290 --> 00:55:13,070
I heard this,

1996
00:55:13,070 --> 00:55:15,650
this you can get on wired this,

1997
00:55:15,651 --> 00:55:15,860
uh,

1998
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:16,693
discussion.

1999
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:17,630
Um,

2000
00:55:17,630 --> 00:55:18,261
it's just something,

2001
00:55:18,261 --> 00:55:18,951
hold on a second,

2002
00:55:18,951 --> 00:55:22,670
I'll find it because maybe we could
pull it up and it's audio anyway.

2003
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:23,960
A wired,

2004
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:25,330
uh,

2005
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:25,880
yeah.

2006
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:26,300
Thank you.

2007
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:28,490
It's McAfee off the rails.

2008
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:31,920
Crazy audio.

2009
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:34,633
Um,

2010
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:36,750
but he was talking about how the,

2011
00:55:36,751 --> 00:55:40,020
there was these people and they were,

2012
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:40,740
um,

2013
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:41,910
they were standing there,

2014
00:55:41,911 --> 00:55:45,390
they were like military people and they
were standing there and they didn't say

2015
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:46,253
anything.

2016
00:55:46,350 --> 00:55:49,350
They just just stood there
and he wouldn't move.

2017
00:55:49,351 --> 00:55:50,760
And so he just stood there too.

2018
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,300
And they slowly went away
like after hours and hours.

2019
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:55,411
Like,

2020
00:55:55,411 --> 00:55:56,550
so he was like standing.

2021
00:55:56,551 --> 00:55:58,140
Then he was talking about like how,

2022
00:55:58,350 --> 00:55:59,460
how much his,

2023
00:55:59,970 --> 00:56:00,803
his uh,

2024
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:03,630
arm hurt because he was like
leaning up against this wall,

2025
00:56:03,631 --> 00:56:04,740
but he couldn't move.

2026
00:56:04,741 --> 00:56:05,221
He moved.

2027
00:56:05,221 --> 00:56:07,160
They would shoot him hand.

2028
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:08,040
Yeah.

2029
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:10,410
But there'll be more saying
there's no footprints there.

2030
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:12,840
There's like he's

2031
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:15,430
was that house that somebody
posted on your message board?

2032
00:56:15,431 --> 00:56:16,420
The guy that died,

2033
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:19,450
like it was like a shack that
had an American flag in it.

2034
00:56:19,451 --> 00:56:19,961
And I don't know.

2035
00:56:19,961 --> 00:56:20,230
No,

2036
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:21,580
I don't know whose house that was.

2037
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:22,490
Yeah.

2038
00:56:22,490 --> 00:56:24,510
Does it that it was
what it was supposed to.

2039
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:25,810
I thought that I thought the guy,

2040
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:27,860
somebody that died
because it was like this.

2041
00:56:28,130 --> 00:56:29,900
I mean it looked like a shack.

2042
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:31,700
Like it just looked like a junkyard shack,

2043
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:32,563
you know?

2044
00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:33,450
Yeah.

2045
00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:34,290
He's fucking,

2046
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:35,573
I don't know man.

2047
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:36,211
Yeah,

2048
00:56:36,211 --> 00:56:36,810
I could,

2049
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:39,720
that was an interesting podcast cause
I kept on thinking about it after,

2050
00:56:39,721 --> 00:56:40,501
when I got home.

2051
00:56:40,501 --> 00:56:42,210
And then the more I thought
about it was just like,

2052
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:42,540
you know,

2053
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:44,520
this just seems like
something's not right.

2054
00:56:44,550 --> 00:56:45,300
It was cool

2055
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:45,750
that he,

2056
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:46,171
he,

2057
00:56:46,171 --> 00:56:46,590
um,

2058
00:56:46,590 --> 00:56:47,423
was willing.

2059
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:47,820
Yeah.

2060
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:48,450
You know,

2061
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:49,440
it was cool that he did it.

2062
00:56:50,090 --> 00:56:51,500
I feel like I'm just
getting trolled though.

2063
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:53,240
Maybe that's what it seems like.

2064
00:56:53,241 --> 00:56:53,601
It doesn't,

2065
00:56:53,601 --> 00:56:56,540
it seems like smells like a big old troll.

2066
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:57,433
Yeah.

2067
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:57,981
Yeah.

2068
00:56:57,981 --> 00:56:58,814
I hope so.

2069
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:00,560
Um,

2070
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:02,330
I'm trying to find in this,

2071
00:57:02,331 --> 00:57:03,164
uh,

2072
00:57:03,230 --> 00:57:06,140
I'm trying to find this because
it's really interesting.

2073
00:57:06,141 --> 00:57:07,610
I really want to want to play it.

2074
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:09,861
Okay.

2075
00:57:09,861 --> 00:57:10,694
Here it is.

2076
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:14,240
If you go to a audio,

2077
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:19,390
just look this Google search says audio
McAfee's still in hiding predicts they

2078
00:57:20,181 --> 00:57:24,650
will track me down and
there's a brilliant man.

2079
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,450
The picture of him was him of course,

2080
00:57:26,451 --> 00:57:27,530
shirtless with a gun,

2081
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:32,270
another different photo of him shirtless
with a gun like apparently posed for

2082
00:57:32,271 --> 00:57:34,550
quite a few photos while holding it.

2083
00:57:34,590 --> 00:57:38,250
Macafee predicts during podcasts
being broadcast to millions of people.

2084
00:57:38,251 --> 00:57:39,390
They will track me down.

2085
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:41,480
Uh,

2086
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:41,890
but he's,

2087
00:57:41,890 --> 00:57:42,610
uh,

2088
00:57:42,610 --> 00:57:43,120
you know,

2089
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:45,590
I appreciate the fact that the
guy was willing to talk to us.

2090
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:46,130
I mean,

2091
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:50,600
it was pretty interesting to be able to
talk to someone who's in this a crazy

2092
00:57:50,601 --> 00:57:51,250
scenario.

2093
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:51,820
Yes.

2094
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:52,653
That's cool.

2095
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:55,170
He was a crazy person
and a crazy scenario.

2096
00:57:55,171 --> 00:57:56,650
It sounds like he's an eccentric,

2097
00:57:56,651 --> 00:57:57,250
you know,

2098
00:57:57,250 --> 00:57:58,083
definitely think,

2099
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:58,781
I mean,

2100
00:57:58,781 --> 00:58:02,920
that's a lot of what it takes to become
some super millionaire type character

2101
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:03,913
that,

2102
00:58:03,930 --> 00:58:04,171
yeah,

2103
00:58:04,171 --> 00:58:05,004
it's true.

2104
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:05,341
I mean,

2105
00:58:05,341 --> 00:58:05,731
that's the thing,

2106
00:58:05,731 --> 00:58:05,941
man.

2107
00:58:05,941 --> 00:58:06,870
You've got to be able to like,

2108
00:58:06,871 --> 00:58:08,580
let your mind go into the weird places,

2109
00:58:08,581 --> 00:58:09,750
but you gotta be able to come back.

2110
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:11,450
Do you see this picture button?

2111
00:58:11,510 --> 00:58:12,380
This is the one that,

2112
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:14,300
that's the audio you wait for,

2113
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:15,380
wait for it to pull up.

2114
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:16,273
Is it Polo?

2115
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:16,761
Yeah,

2116
00:58:16,761 --> 00:58:17,061
it's,

2117
00:58:17,061 --> 00:58:17,894
um,

2118
00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:20,000
the whole story is so compelling.

2119
00:58:20,001 --> 00:58:22,460
It's so hunters Thompson ask like,

2120
00:58:22,461 --> 00:58:25,340
this guy just goes off
the rails on an island.

2121
00:58:25,341 --> 00:58:26,480
67 years old,

2122
00:58:26,481 --> 00:58:27,650
20 year old girlfriends.

2123
00:58:27,651 --> 00:58:28,040
Yeah.

2124
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,390
Pictures of him with guns.

2125
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:29,930
Yeah.

2126
00:58:29,930 --> 00:58:31,370
Surrounded by dogs.

2127
00:58:31,371 --> 00:58:32,570
He's got 11 dogs.

2128
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:33,051
You know what I mean?

2129
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:33,471
It's like,

2130
00:58:33,471 --> 00:58:34,040
wow.

2131
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:35,600
It's like Pharaoh.

2132
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:37,310
He went Pharrel's amazing.

2133
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:42,740
And he has all these lawsuits that are
coming after him and he will not pay.

2134
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:43,131
He's like,

2135
00:58:43,131 --> 00:58:44,270
I simply will not pay.

2136
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:44,901
He goes,

2137
00:58:44,901 --> 00:58:45,170
uh,

2138
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:46,003
I will,

2139
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:47,030
I,

2140
00:58:47,030 --> 00:58:49,190
I will spend $10 million to fight it,

2141
00:58:49,191 --> 00:58:50,024
to give them nothing.

2142
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:51,380
What are the lawsuits about?

2143
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:51,681
Well,

2144
00:58:51,681 --> 00:58:52,850
one of them was about,

2145
00:58:52,851 --> 00:58:53,840
he had this,

2146
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:55,370
he was connected to this,

2147
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:56,283
uh,

2148
00:58:57,020 --> 00:58:59,180
sort of a sport where they would fly.

2149
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:02,570
These looked like motorcycles
that are attached to kite wings.

2150
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:03,651
It's really crazy.

2151
00:59:03,651 --> 00:59:04,700
And they're really maneuverable.

2152
00:59:04,701 --> 00:59:05,930
Apparently what they would do,

2153
00:59:05,931 --> 00:59:07,730
these low altitude,

2154
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:08,061
you know,

2155
00:59:08,061 --> 00:59:10,010
not even altitude low off,

2156
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:12,770
I mean basically just
very close to the ground.

2157
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:17,450
They would do these things like acrobatics
spin around on these fucking plants.

2158
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:18,890
Whole swing crashed and died.

2159
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:19,310
Right.

2160
00:59:19,310 --> 00:59:24,240
And so he got sued and that's when he
decided apparently to move to beliefs,

2161
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:28,020
you just loaded up his truck and he
moved to bevel a just get the fuck out.

2162
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:32,490
And I guess Billy's won't
extradite him or something.

2163
00:59:32,491 --> 00:59:33,324
I don't know how it works,

2164
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:34,980
but if,

2165
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:38,370
if he apparently says that
if he loses the court cases,

2166
00:59:38,371 --> 00:59:38,941
it doesn't matter.

2167
00:59:38,941 --> 00:59:40,140
They'll just come and take his money.

2168
00:59:40,530 --> 00:59:41,130
Like if,

2169
00:59:41,130 --> 00:59:41,911
if you lose,

2170
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:42,744
you lose.

2171
00:59:42,810 --> 00:59:46,500
But that he doesn't believe that he's
guilty because he wasn't even driving it.

2172
00:59:46,501 --> 00:59:47,500
He wasn't a response.

2173
00:59:47,501 --> 00:59:49,290
He wasn't responsible for maintaining it.

2174
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:50,070
It wasn't his,

2175
00:59:50,070 --> 00:59:50,820
you know what I mean?

2176
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:51,960
It's like it wasn't his fault.

2177
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:53,220
This guy died like this,

2178
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:57,660
but apparently he was like working hard
to promote this crazy sort of a sport.

2179
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:00,000
John McAfee,

2180
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:03,920
who was calling to tell me that
the police were closing in.

2181
01:00:03,921 --> 01:00:08,180
He had spent the night and an undisclosed
house in Belize sleeping on a bed

2182
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:11,690
infested with lice and that
he felt that the end was near,

2183
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:13,820
that they would arrest him at any minute,

2184
01:00:13,821 --> 01:00:16,970
but he was not going to surrender because
he was convinced that they would kill

2185
01:00:16,971 --> 01:00:17,804
him.

2186
01:00:17,930 --> 01:00:21,650
I've been following McAfee's case
and believes for the past six months,

2187
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:26,651
ever since April 30th when the police
raided him and accused him of being a drug

2188
01:00:26,871 --> 01:00:29,960
trafficker and possessing
illegal firearms.

2189
01:00:30,650 --> 01:00:30,920
Uh,

2190
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,360
over those six months,

2191
01:00:32,361 --> 01:00:36,620
I've spent weeks and Billy's
and interviewed McAfee
both in person and on the

2192
01:00:36,621 --> 01:00:37,251
telephone,

2193
01:00:37,251 --> 01:00:39,410
probably over a hundred
hours of interviews.

2194
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:42,860
And I can say without a doubt
that he is a very complex person,

2195
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:46,610
but whether or not is a
murderer is yet to be seen.

2196
01:00:48,170 --> 01:00:51,260
I recorded McAfee's phone calls to
me this morning with his permission.

2197
01:00:51,290 --> 01:00:53,240
And what follows are those calls,

2198
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:57,840
one of the charges against you
is that you're a psychopath.

2199
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:00,090
What do you have to say about Tom?

2200
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:06,090
I would not be confidence or to uh,

2201
01:01:06,490 --> 01:01:07,390
to comment on it,

2202
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:08,973
yes or no,

2203
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:13,890
then I either one if I were a
psychopath would be irrelevant.

2204
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:15,570
I don't think I'm a psychopath.

2205
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:16,733
I liked people.

2206
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:18,090
I think psychopaths are,

2207
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:21,670
are sort of anti social
folks that hey people,

2208
01:01:21,730 --> 01:01:22,860
I tend to love people.

2209
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:26,700
I tend to love people in
spite of their faults,

2210
01:01:26,710 --> 01:01:30,450
in spite of the things that
they do or attempt to do.

2211
01:01:30,451 --> 01:01:31,284
To me.

2212
01:01:31,990 --> 01:01:33,150
You're well aware of,

2213
01:01:33,350 --> 01:01:34,800
of Marcy for example,

2214
01:01:34,801 --> 01:01:35,460
who,

2215
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:40,460
who plotted for for three months they
have me kidnapped for money and um,

2216
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:42,860
yeah,

2217
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:44,770
whenever she,

2218
01:01:45,130 --> 01:01:49,750
she lived with me after that for two
additional months before they finally got

2219
01:01:49,751 --> 01:01:50,584
too intense.

2220
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:54,030
This is a good question.

2221
01:01:54,090 --> 01:01:59,090
Why do you surround yourself with
people of questionable character?

2222
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:01,390
Well,

2223
01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:05,170
I surround myself with people of club
on questionable character to Eddie and

2224
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:05,681
Kona is,

2225
01:02:05,681 --> 01:02:06,281
I don't know,

2226
01:02:06,281 --> 01:02:07,180
a more honest,

2227
01:02:07,181 --> 01:02:10,460
a god fearing person yourself.

2228
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:12,370
So I think I'd be friended to and,

2229
01:02:12,430 --> 01:02:12,940
and,

2230
01:02:12,940 --> 01:02:15,590
and embraced you as I
embraced anyone else.

2231
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:17,440
Not even the audio that I was looking for,

2232
01:02:17,441 --> 01:02:18,270
unfortunately.

2233
01:02:18,270 --> 01:02:19,103
Pretty good.

2234
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:20,030
But the

2235
01:02:20,030 --> 01:02:22,550
other one was better
because it was really nuts

2236
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:22,780
do,

2237
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:24,230
when I worked at the comedy store,

2238
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:25,640
there was this lady who would call,

2239
01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:26,780
I can't remember her name,

2240
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,480
but she would call and like I,

2241
01:02:28,510 --> 01:02:28,990
I,

2242
01:02:28,990 --> 01:02:33,890
she is interesting her the way
that her insanity function,

2243
01:02:33,891 --> 01:02:35,060
cause she'd call and be like,

2244
01:02:35,330 --> 01:02:37,530
she would always say she used
to work out their camera name,

2245
01:02:37,531 --> 01:02:39,260
but then she'd like start being like,

2246
01:02:39,261 --> 01:02:39,561
yes,

2247
01:02:39,561 --> 01:02:40,394
you know?

2248
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:40,791
Yeah.

2249
01:02:40,791 --> 01:02:42,080
Last Wednesday,

2250
01:02:42,110 --> 01:02:46,670
three men came into my house and they
raped me and laughed and you know,

2251
01:02:46,671 --> 01:02:50,000
like we'd slip in these
really weird hardcore story.

2252
01:02:50,001 --> 01:02:53,300
She called a few times and it was
always like these plots against her,

2253
01:02:53,301 --> 01:02:53,541
you know,

2254
01:02:53,541 --> 01:02:53,721
they,

2255
01:02:53,721 --> 01:02:54,680
they did like,

2256
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:55,371
you know,

2257
01:02:55,371 --> 01:02:56,570
I was kidnapped.

2258
01:02:56,660 --> 01:02:57,210
Uh,

2259
01:02:57,210 --> 01:02:58,280
she was just making things up.

2260
01:02:58,370 --> 01:02:58,760
She had,

2261
01:02:58,760 --> 01:02:59,990
but she believed it.

2262
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:01,250
And you know what I mean?

2263
01:03:01,251 --> 01:03:02,570
It's like when your mind,

2264
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:03,950
I'm not saying I don't know about Maca.

2265
01:03:03,951 --> 01:03:04,431
I don't know.

2266
01:03:04,431 --> 01:03:04,881
Who knows?

2267
01:03:04,881 --> 01:03:06,710
Maybe he's all together
and he's totally there.

2268
01:03:06,711 --> 01:03:08,030
People were really plotting against him.

2269
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:08,600
I mean,

2270
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:10,490
rich people live in a different land.

2271
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:15,020
But it's interesting how
like people who are paranoid,

2272
01:03:15,021 --> 01:03:15,890
the way it comes out,

2273
01:03:15,891 --> 01:03:17,510
it's not like they're
gonna be like everybody's

2274
01:03:19,290 --> 01:03:20,760
see that people are looking to kidnap him.

2275
01:03:20,761 --> 01:03:22,470
She has been plotting
to kidnap me and for,

2276
01:03:22,471 --> 01:03:23,080
so when I'm,

2277
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:25,980
when someone starts talking and
that sort of matter of factly,

2278
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:26,591
there's,

2279
01:03:26,591 --> 01:03:29,100
there's a disconnect there
from reality as well.

2280
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:29,401
Dude,

2281
01:03:29,401 --> 01:03:30,234
we gotta end this pocket.

2282
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:30,600
Oh,

2283
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:31,350
get the fuck out of here.

2284
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:32,100
I'm so sorry,

2285
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:33,240
but we'll do it again quite soon.

2286
01:03:33,241 --> 01:03:33,670
Cool.

2287
01:03:33,670 --> 01:03:35,450
Let's try it again as
often as possible please.

2288
01:03:35,490 --> 01:03:35,910
Powerful,

2289
01:03:35,910 --> 01:03:39,980
powerful Dunkin proper Brian driving all
the way over here for 40 minutes of use

2290
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:40,610
stream.

2291
01:03:40,610 --> 01:03:41,460
You're the fucking man.

2292
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:42,300
Uh,

2293
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:42,720
and uh,

2294
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:46,350
we will be back tomorrow at 3:00
PM here with the Great Eddie Bravo.

2295
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:47,001
So,

2296
01:03:47,001 --> 01:03:47,161
uh,

2297
01:03:47,161 --> 01:03:49,380
we're going to have some
fun and then this weekend,

2298
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:50,100
um,

2299
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:50,820
Dunkin,

2300
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:53,940
me and just three of us in
this room will be in Austin,

2301
01:03:53,941 --> 01:03:57,390
Texas and we will be performing
at Austin city limits.

2302
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:58,800
Should be really fun at the Moody Theater.

2303
01:03:58,801 --> 01:04:02,100
It's called and a fucking
really looking forward to that.

2304
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:03,690
We don't get a chance to
go to Austin that often.

2305
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:04,020
Austin,

2306
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:04,853
I love Austin.

2307
01:04:04,950 --> 01:04:05,491
One of the grades.

2308
01:04:05,491 --> 01:04:06,324
I wouldn't marry us.

2309
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:07,680
I would marry the Fucker to Austin.

2310
01:04:07,681 --> 01:04:08,230
It's a great setup.

2311
01:04:08,230 --> 01:04:09,300
Definitely Mary Austin,

2312
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:10,600
Austin come this,

2313
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,420
this show had no commercials
in the beginning.

2314
01:04:12,421 --> 01:04:13,560
You will have none of the end.

2315
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:15,270
I am sorry sponsors,

2316
01:04:15,271 --> 01:04:16,560
but go fuck yourself today.

2317

A profit on it.com that's it.

2318
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:21,393
Show's over.
