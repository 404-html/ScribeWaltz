1
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,860
Five four,

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,053
three,

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,390
two law and with luck,

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:09,701
dude,

5
00:00:09,701 --> 00:00:10,950
a bright to the dark side.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Now you plan quick.

7
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,133
I got my ass whooped.

8
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:14,011
Yeah.

9
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:15,750
Well you were in a fucking melee.

10
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,730
There's three other dudes
and they're blasting.

11
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:20,240
It's a one on one map that maps chaos.

12
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,180
It's so fun though.

13
00:00:21,181 --> 00:00:22,140
How Fun is that Shit?

14
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,400
It reminds me of golden eye.

15
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:24,690
Did you ever get into that?

16
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:25,650
How dare you?

17
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,220
First of all,

18
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,870
64 that's a great game.

19
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:30,210
That check came can suck all the dicks.

20
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:35,100
You using those stupid x-box things
lets you control the mouse and keyboard.

21
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:35,881
It's where you're at.

22
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:37,050
That's why you get fucked up.

23
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:38,070
You don't even know how to move.

24
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,780
It was hard for me to move back and
forth if it was the controller at game on

25
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:44,423
what?

26
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:44,930
Yeah,

27
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:46,080
yeah cause nobody can move.

28
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:47,371
Nobody can move.

29
00:00:47,371 --> 00:00:49,510
Then you're all right with
control this and did that.

30
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:50,970
Fucking that game's chaos.

31
00:00:50,971 --> 00:00:54,510
Jamie and I've been going back and
forth for fucking four or five days now.

32
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,500
You'd be surprised.

33
00:00:55,501 --> 00:00:57,510
There are a couple of
guys that can compete.

34
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,820
A few that can compete with
the mouse and keyboard.

35
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:00,720
I wouldn't be surprised.

36
00:01:00,721 --> 00:01:01,471
I'm sure they can,

37
00:01:01,471 --> 00:01:02,790
but they have zero life.

38
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,710
They don't even know
what a pussy looks like.

39
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,750
Old School quakes.

40
00:01:09,751 --> 00:01:10,321
Old Score,

41
00:01:10,321 --> 00:01:10,491
right?

42
00:01:10,491 --> 00:01:10,771
Yeah.

43
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:10,980
Cool.

44
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,920
We're on quick for this quake
champions that you play on line.

45
00:01:13,921 --> 00:01:14,870
We've been playing quake for,

46
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,000
because we could set it up on
what's called a local area network,

47
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:18,571
a lan,

48
00:01:18,571 --> 00:01:20,760
and it's real easy and there's no latency.

49
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,040
It's just direct from
computer to computer.

50
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:24,840
It's fun to just thinking of the one guy,

51
00:01:24,841 --> 00:01:26,730
he said he's really
aggressive workout dude.

52
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:27,840
What's that?

53
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,920
The guy that I'm thinking of,

54
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:29,760
he's a,

55
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,230
he's a video video can play a very good,

56
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:31,890
he's really good.

57
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:32,820
He hasn't named Nick Marks.

58
00:01:32,821 --> 00:01:33,550
I'm only taking,

59
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:34,580
I'm sure he gets pissy.

60
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,390
There's some good looking dude.

61
00:01:36,391 --> 00:01:36,700
Yeah,

62
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,620
I'm sure there are.

63
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:38,341
I'm sure there are,

64
00:01:38,341 --> 00:01:39,660
but it's not fun to say no.

65
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,910
It's fun to say that
they weighed four pounds.

66
00:01:41,911 --> 00:01:43,170
You'd like to picture of Miss Jess.

67
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:43,421
Yeah,

68
00:01:43,421 --> 00:01:44,430
and they can't find their deck,

69
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:46,180
but now those kids make

70
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,510
money.

71
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,100
Here's even hot chicks
who play video games.

72
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:50,760
Oh yeah.

73
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,061
Well,

74
00:01:51,061 --> 00:01:52,490
it's a good move for hot chick.

75
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,310
Like there's,

76
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,850
there's hot chicks that hunt because
like in they wear makeup and shit,

77
00:01:56,851 --> 00:02:00,330
full eyelashes and shed because
it brings them into that world.

78
00:02:00,331 --> 00:02:01,630
And then all the guys were good.

79
00:02:01,631 --> 00:02:02,380
You look at hers,

80
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,001
she loves went.

81
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:03,834
Oh look.

82
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,093
Yeah.

83
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:10,410
It was like stand in front of like a
endangered species with their tits out.

84
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,330
Like there's hot girls
to take Moitai class.

85
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:12,631
Right.

86
00:02:12,631 --> 00:02:14,310
And they get all serious angry face.

87
00:02:14,311 --> 00:02:15,360
Don't talk to anybody.

88
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,590
Pretend they're real fighters.

89
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,690
Some of them are real.

90
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:18,961
Yeah,

91
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:19,310
but let,

92
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,490
some of them are not though.

93
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,320
Some of them get super serious.

94
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,730
That's when I whisper like this.

95
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:25,363
Yeah.

96
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,040
When they say,

97
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,140
I don't like when people say I'm going,

98
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,760
I'm on a train today.

99
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,170
I'm like,

100
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,003
well what are you doing?

101
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,770
He'd taken [inaudible] training.

102
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,693
That's not training.

103
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,750
We trained for what we'll your training
for the top clubs are be training for

104
00:02:39,751 --> 00:02:40,584
some deck.

105
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:42,893
Ah,

106
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,960
his God damn games.

107
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,010
They're so addictive.

108
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,960
You word like straight
up addicted to them,

109
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:49,260
right?

110
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:49,741
Oh yeah.

111
00:02:49,741 --> 00:02:50,574
I had a real problem.

112
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:50,851
Well,

113
00:02:50,851 --> 00:02:52,560
I kind of got a little
bit of a problem now.

114
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,390
Jamie and I have been
talking back and forth.

115
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,920
He's up on me a little bit too.

116
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,170
That's why I have to kick Jeff out every
now and then just so Jamie and I go one

117
00:02:59,171 --> 00:03:00,004
on one,

118
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:00,881
one on one.

119
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:03,250
Last time I fucked him up and he hit.

120
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,470
He quit cause me and Jeffrey he pray.

121
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:07,690
Right like you can just
not easy prey anymore.

122
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,360
Jeff was easy prey for a little bit.

123
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,160
If I want all these games.

124
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,960
How long do you think we'd
be here playing quick.

125
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,913
True.

126
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,090
You want to get you one,

127
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:19,990
all these keys to competitor you would
you say and you lost 13 to five because

128
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,040
you were trying real hard.

129
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,540
You got fucked up son.

130
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,160
I let you up and talking to change.

131
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:25,681
You were talking,

132
00:03:25,681 --> 00:03:27,130
you said take and he says,

133
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:27,491
yeah,

134
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:28,324
sure.

135
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,433
Fucked him up.

136
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,560
The problem with having another person
in the thing is he always goes after Jeff

137
00:03:35,561 --> 00:03:35,861
first.

138
00:03:35,861 --> 00:03:36,191
He said,

139
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:36,910
easy kill.

140
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:37,281
That's what I mean.

141
00:03:37,281 --> 00:03:38,230
He comes and gets me.

142
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,520
I couldn't really get my fucking be
quite yes are killing me right away.

143
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:42,670
No.

144
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:43,700
Jeff starting to win.

145
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:47,370
He came real close to when that last
one because he had the same old.

146
00:03:47,371 --> 00:03:47,861
We're not a lot.

147
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:50,610
He's definitely should
be playing right now.

148
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,673
It'd be smart.

149
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,980
Well I told him to
fucking lift weights too.

150
00:03:53,981 --> 00:03:54,311
I'm like,

151
00:03:54,311 --> 00:03:54,551
dude,

152
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:57,010
you kind of this whole gym
here while shows going on.

153
00:03:57,011 --> 00:03:58,030
Watch the security camera.

154
00:03:58,031 --> 00:03:58,864
Get your pump on.

155
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,290
Just get checked.

156
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:03,760
So he could call out there.

157
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:04,960
So let's talk about these fights,

158
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:05,500
bro.

159
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,333
First of all,

160
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,370
let's start with Diego
motherfucking Sanchez.

161
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,870
All these young guns sleeping on
Diego Sanchez fully redeemed himself.

162
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,100
Do not sleep.

163
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,240
Do not.

164
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:17,770
Just do not,

165
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,380
just don't cause he will fuck.

166
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,340
Ugh.

167
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,210
People up still.

168
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,580
How about Micky Gall bid
and did you see that?

169
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:25,280
I saw this.

170
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,820
As you see there's a
video of him bite him.

171
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,020
Well there's a video of Diego.

172
00:04:29,021 --> 00:04:30,010
Go and look at this shit.

173
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,191
Yeah,

174
00:04:30,191 --> 00:04:30,641
Diego,

175
00:04:30,641 --> 00:04:35,641
I saw on his Instagram he showed his
chest where he does a bit that it's crazy.

176
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:41,260
I thought they said Micky
Gall had a hard cut,

177
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,000
like a really hard cut.

178
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,980
And maybe that's one of the
reasons he got so tired.

179
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,170
I just don't think that so far.

180
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:47,651
He's just,

181
00:04:47,651 --> 00:04:48,760
the skills aren't there yet.

182
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:49,290
No.

183
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,040
He was out of his element a little bit.

184
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:51,830
Well,

185
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:55,030
I gave you outclass Diego is a monster.

186
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,570
I mean,

187
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:58,210
you're dealing with a guy who has 40.

188
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,320
Look at that bite mark.

189
00:04:59,321 --> 00:04:59,890
That is,

190
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:00,820
that is crazy.

191
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,890
Bite the fuck Micky Gall.

192
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,710
All bytes guys had been guys before.

193
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:06,563
You can't be on my team.

194
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,240
Yeah,

195
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,073
you're off the team.

196
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:09,610
It's not good.

197
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,503
It's bad luck.

198
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,670
[inaudible] Diego didn't
say shit to the referee.

199
00:05:12,671 --> 00:05:13,481
Just kept smashed.

200
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:13,751
Dude.

201
00:05:13,751 --> 00:05:17,200
He is such a savage and he's a sandwiches
they getting since he was four years

202
00:05:17,201 --> 00:05:17,920
old in the USA,

203
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:22,090
he won ultimate fighter season one,

204
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:26,590
2005 14 fucking years ago.

205
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,550
That middle weight.

206
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:28,150
Yup.

207
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,100
14 fucking years ago.

208
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:33,130
You don't have to stop and think
about what an insane career that is.

209
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,660
And his last two fights,

210
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:35,460
um,

211
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,370
w I think you last fight
was Craig [inaudible].

212
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,300
Is that who he fought last smashed?

213
00:05:39,301 --> 00:05:42,760
That dude smashed and then
smashed Micky gall dude.

214
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:42,971
He,

215
00:05:42,971 --> 00:05:43,571
he's the,

216
00:05:43,571 --> 00:05:43,930
uh,

217
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,400
he's the mascot for Jackson's.

218
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:45,671
Right?

219
00:05:45,671 --> 00:05:46,840
Like if there's a logo,

220
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,950
it's Diego Sanchez.

221
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,130
Yeah.

222
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:48,731
And every prayer,

223
00:05:48,731 --> 00:05:50,380
but he knows that his Brendan chubs voice.

224
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,700
I sound like Alec Jones Right now.

225
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:54,283
Not,

226
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,180
not loud enough.

227
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:55,421
Yeah,

228
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:55,910
you're right.

229
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:56,590
Yeah.

230
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,220
You sound like Chubb with a cold.

231
00:05:59,210 --> 00:05:59,661
I don't see,

232
00:05:59,661 --> 00:06:00,620
I don't feel sick.

233
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,281
You don't feel sick,

234
00:06:01,281 --> 00:06:02,300
so it's just a sore throat,

235
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:02,930
I think.

236
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:03,200
Yeah.

237
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,460
But how's your throat just go?

238
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:05,510
We screaming at someone.

239
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:06,483
No,

240
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,060
I was chilling.

241
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,300
I did two purchasing wolf howls.

242
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,280
Sometimes my voice goes,

243
00:06:13,281 --> 00:06:14,114
I'm not saying,

244
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:14,511
oh,

245
00:06:14,511 --> 00:06:15,344
that's so great.

246
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:15,980
That's weird.

247
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,960
Cause I am sick a little bit.

248
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,420
Really?

249
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,253
Yeah.

250
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,550
Well I had it over the weekend and
yesterday I felt like dog shit.

251
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,533
Do you work out?

252
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,830
I worked out,

253
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:25,310
uh,

254
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:25,911
not yesterday,

255
00:06:25,911 --> 00:06:26,670
but Saturday.

256
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:27,381
Worked outside of the,

257
00:06:27,381 --> 00:06:28,370
it probably wasn't a good idea.

258
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,300
They say when you work out,

259
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:31,820
when you're seeking mates at
worst you can system's down.

260
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:32,731
I usually show up.

261
00:06:32,731 --> 00:06:33,320
Do it too.

262
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,280
I lifted too,

263
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,413
and you know,

264
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:36,260
it's not smart.

265
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,010
No,

266
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:37,321
but I,

267
00:06:37,321 --> 00:06:37,640
I,

268
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,830
I'm okay today I'm just like a little,

269
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,820
little worn out,

270
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:41,820
but my voice is all right.

271
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:42,920
You should need some rest.

272
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,220
Yeah,

273
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:43,520
yeah,

274
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:43,850
yeah.

275
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:44,390
I mean,

276
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,223
I'll be fine.

277
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,670
I'm traveling doesn't help.

278
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,211
No,

279
00:06:47,211 --> 00:06:50,120
it's the worst man because always I
always take the first flight back cause I

280
00:06:50,121 --> 00:06:52,870
want to see my family and mostly,

281
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:53,210
yeah,

282
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:53,720
I got the,

283
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,410
that makes it worse.

284
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:54,591
Yeah.

285
00:06:54,591 --> 00:06:55,580
I was up at five.

286
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,913
Um,

287
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,290
so Micky gall in that fight,

288
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,520
he asked for that fight.

289
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,510
That was a fight.

290
00:07:02,511 --> 00:07:04,010
He was begging Dana white to give him.

291
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,260
He thought it was a good fight for him.

292
00:07:05,261 --> 00:07:06,510
He thought it was a good match up.

293
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,230
I don't know why people think that.

294
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,420
I guess cause like he's been knocked out.

295
00:07:11,421 --> 00:07:11,730
Right.

296
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:12,710
Ally Quinta.

297
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:13,630
Kao Damn.

298
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,490
Um,

299
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:15,080
uh,

300
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,891
Matt Brown.

301
00:07:15,891 --> 00:07:16,700
Kao Dem,

302
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,890
but he's a big name has
been doing for a long time.

303
00:07:18,891 --> 00:07:19,940
So these young guys go,

304
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:20,480
oh,

305
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,620
I grew up watching him.

306
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,513
Let me get him.

307
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:22,941
Well they,

308
00:07:22,941 --> 00:07:26,240
I think they also think he's been
doing it for so long and they're right.

309
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:26,900
Yeah.

310
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,910
But he's still so fucking tough,

311
00:07:28,911 --> 00:07:29,300
man.

312
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,200
He has all the skills.

313
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:34,690
He still has all the skills and his
ground and pound his fucking for Roche's.

314
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,320
And once he's on the ground,

315
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,041
then he doesn't,

316
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:37,670
I mean,

317
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,830
if there's a hole in Diego's game,

318
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,960
you would have to say
against like elite Strykers.

319
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:42,860
He has a real problem.

320
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,690
Like guys like Matt Brown,

321
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:45,770
he's going to have problems.

322
00:07:45,771 --> 00:07:48,020
He's just not as fluid as those guys,

323
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,130
you know?

324
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:49,410
Yeah.

325
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:50,870
Diego's grappling to amazing,

326
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:51,350
amazing,

327
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:51,860
amazing.

328
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,200
And his ferocity can not eat question.

329
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,510
He's just mental games.

330
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:56,963
Savage.

331
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:01,040
Just to think about the enthusiasm Diego
has after all these years in the game,

332
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,420
all these years in the game,

333
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,700
unbelievable craze.

334
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:04,543
How many years,

335
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:05,803
how many years?

336
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,280
What we know?

337
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,290
14 years in the UFC.

338
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,600
But he fought before that he was,

339
00:08:11,601 --> 00:08:12,440
he was a veteran.

340
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,390
I mean he had several
fights before the UMC.

341
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,430
Yeah.

342
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,090
Oh yeah.

343
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:17,510
Oh yeah.

344
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,343
Oh yeah.

345
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,400
Crazy.

346
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:19,821
Crazy.

347
00:08:19,821 --> 00:08:20,601
How long he's been doing it.

348
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:21,650
And again,

349
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,380
how long he's been doing it
and how much he loves it still.

350
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,540
And he says CBD is really helping him.

351
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:27,650
He's got his own CBD,

352
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,070
2002 Damn motherfuckers.

353
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,080
17 years in years.

354
00:08:33,081 --> 00:08:34,490
He fought Michael Johnson.

355
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,940
2000 same Michael Johnson.

356
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,953
No Way.

357
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:39,943
Like my mind,

358
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,200
Michael was six years.

359
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,063
What's that?

360
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,960
His name would probably
be a tag there if it was.

361
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,211
Yeah.

362
00:08:44,211 --> 00:08:44,410
What?

363
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:44,840
Right.

364
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,620
That's not Michael.

365
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:45,830
Wow.

366
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:48,290
He fought Shannon rich on his third fight.

367
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,450
Shannon rich has like a
million fights kick on.

368
00:08:50,451 --> 00:08:51,190
Shannon rich,

369
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:55,770
which in my get Gaiman the joker
old school to then click on Shannon.

370
00:08:55,771 --> 00:08:56,310
Rich,

371
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,041
how many fights is it?

372
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:57,874
Yeah,

373
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:58,813
I'm gonna say he's got,

374
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,480
how many does it say?

375
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,090
Holy Shit.

376
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,240
Say the regular doses.

377
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,000
53 it's Jesus Christ.

378
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,330
It's the worst record of every sad.

379
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,173
It's crazy.

380
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,960
That is crazy.

381
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,810
Shout out to that guy
though for keeping with it.

382
00:09:12,811 --> 00:09:14,070
You know that is crazy.

383
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:15,270
Lost 79 times.

384
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,320
Jesus Christ.

385
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:17,770
42 kickboxing.

386
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:18,631
Oh my God.

387
00:09:18,631 --> 00:09:20,250
At 42 kickboxing matches.

388
00:09:20,251 --> 00:09:22,170
Jesus Christ.

389
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,970
Blake kickbox and he's kind of killing it.

390
00:09:23,971 --> 00:09:26,010
35 and seven not bad,

391
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,470
but that's an insane amount of experience.

392
00:09:28,471 --> 00:09:32,440
But just stop and think
about 17 years in Diego.

393
00:09:32,441 --> 00:09:35,280
Still slinging and so much enthusiasm.

394
00:09:35,281 --> 00:09:36,300
That's the crazy part.

395
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:40,720
It's not just that he's fighting that he
fights fires the fucking angry cause he

396
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,990
had his own CBD company
now gave me some of it.

397
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,033
Any good?

398
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:44,933
I haven't tried it yet.

399
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:45,531
He just gave me,

400
00:09:45,531 --> 00:09:47,010
he gave me some bottles of his stuff,

401
00:09:47,011 --> 00:09:47,890
but he's,

402
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,680
he mean he really believes in CBD.

403
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:50,580
A lot of fighters do.

404
00:09:50,581 --> 00:09:51,870
It's helping them lot whereby it,

405
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,260
yeah,

406
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,093
it's amazing.

407
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:53,761
Amazing.

408
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:55,280
Stop Spectrum CBD oil.

409
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:55,891
That's what I,

410
00:09:55,891 --> 00:09:56,724
yeah,

411
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,170
I mean there's so many good companies now,

412
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:59,130
but uh,

413
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,540
you know another fight.

414
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,111
That was crazy.

415
00:10:01,111 --> 00:10:03,330
How about Colby and Pedro?

416
00:10:03,331 --> 00:10:04,164
Munoz?

417
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:04,751
Are you talking about,

418
00:10:04,751 --> 00:10:05,550
you're talking about code?

419
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,030
Well,

420
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:06,701
you skipped past.

421
00:10:06,701 --> 00:10:07,534
This is a beat.

422
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:07,921
Oh,

423
00:10:07,921 --> 00:10:08,790
Jeremy Stephens,

424
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,950
which I thought crazy.

425
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,541
Crazy and no,

426
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,640
I mean for as a beat to beat
the number six out in the world.

427
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,210
Yeah,

428
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,100
it was good.

429
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:17,963
What'd you think?

430
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:18,923
Um,

431
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:23,490
I didn't think it helps a beet stock
because there's so much hype on him.

432
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:24,773
You didn't

433
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:27,420
really,

434
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:27,631
well,

435
00:10:27,631 --> 00:10:28,464
first of all,

436
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,221
he's fighting Jeremy.

437
00:10:29,221 --> 00:10:30,054
Steve Agree.

438
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,430
Jeremy Stevens is fucking dangerous.

439
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:34,170
You can't ask any mistakes with that guy.

440
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,090
You didn't think you look good though.

441
00:10:36,091 --> 00:10:36,871
I thought it looked okay.

442
00:10:36,871 --> 00:10:39,090
I didn't think he has stock went
through the roof with that fight.

443
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,830
You didn't walk away
from that fight going,

444
00:10:40,831 --> 00:10:41,281
oh my God,

445
00:10:41,281 --> 00:10:42,360
I can't wait to see him fight again.

446
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,800
Look good.

447
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,340
But when you,

448
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,500
when you hear Mark Henry's
coach talk about them.

449
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,230
I mean they talk about him
like he's the next fucking,

450
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,330
did you see that three 60 roundhouse kick?

451
00:10:51,331 --> 00:10:52,164
He tried.

452
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:52,441
Yeah.

453
00:10:52,441 --> 00:10:56,220
That missed the shit so fast.

454
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,890
He's really fast and his,

455
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,040
his round kick to the
body is just so fast.

456
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:02,880
Like lightning.

457
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,391
Amazing.

458
00:11:03,391 --> 00:11:05,190
Throw such a to such a talent.

459
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:08,280
So technical to everything
he does is very smooth.

460
00:11:08,281 --> 00:11:08,921
Doesn't get hit.

461
00:11:08,921 --> 00:11:10,050
It doesn't play that game.

462
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,620
No,

463
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,040
no.

464
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,840
It doesn't play the game
that Cody Garbrandt played.

465
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:16,050
The Patriot Cody got flight was crazy.

466
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:17,250
I just see losses in a row.

467
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:17,461
Three,

468
00:11:17,461 --> 00:11:17,730
nine,

469
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:18,840
three k hours in a row.

470
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:21,210
I just couldn't believe he was
standing with him like that.

471
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:21,851
He got,

472
00:11:21,851 --> 00:11:22,684
I'm hurt.

473
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,610
And then he got her and then he was
determined to take him out and then they

474
00:11:26,611 --> 00:11:27,630
were literally going,

475
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:28,531
all right.

476
00:11:28,531 --> 00:11:31,890
Hand Hook right hand or
right hand on someone fell.

477
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:32,311
Yeah.

478
00:11:32,311 --> 00:11:34,200
And Pedro can take a shot.

479
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,160
So can Cody.

480
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,100
Yeah,

481
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:36,870
eight shots.

482
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,040
He ate some big ones,

483
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,570
but it makes no sense if you're Cody.

484
00:11:39,571 --> 00:11:40,650
So technical.

485
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,300
I know it doesn't make any sense the head,

486
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:44,010
but he said he got head
button and just saw a red,

487
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:45,150
but he definitely did.

488
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,310
He definitely got headbutted.

489
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,390
Aaron Peko and he talked about it.

490
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:51,090
He said he saw a red
like got angry about it.

491
00:11:51,091 --> 00:11:51,420
Yeah.

492
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:51,721
Yeah.

493
00:11:51,721 --> 00:11:52,554
He can't do that.

494
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,261
Yeah.

495
00:11:53,261 --> 00:11:54,450
You got to fight Intel.

496
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,920
I mean obviously it's
super easy for us to say,

497
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:57,641
you know,

498
00:11:57,641 --> 00:11:59,560
sitting here drinking coffee.

499
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:00,220
Yeah.

500
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:00,820
Don't fight it.

501
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,020
Don't fight her angry bro.

502
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:02,620
You know?

503
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,453
It's easy to say,

504
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:06,030
but that's also what makes him so dynamic.

505
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:06,371
I agree.

506
00:12:06,371 --> 00:12:07,390
It's what got him to the party,

507
00:12:07,391 --> 00:12:08,500
but as a former fighter,

508
00:12:08,501 --> 00:12:10,360
it's like coming off two losses,

509
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,860
which I've been there.

510
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,810
You're usually a little more like,

511
00:12:13,811 --> 00:12:14,710
I am not going to go down.

512
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:18,160
That road had been knocked out
twice and know how that ends.

513
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:18,550
Yeah.

514
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,383
If I get hit,

515
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,190
let's learn from our mistakes.

516
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:21,460
Right,

517
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:21,700
right.

518
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,960
That's what's the troubling part.

519
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:23,801
Yeah.

520
00:12:23,801 --> 00:12:24,634
And he,

521
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,740
he has a speed advantage Patrell monies.

522
00:12:26,741 --> 00:12:27,700
That's very good timing.

523
00:12:27,701 --> 00:12:31,930
But I think Colby has a speed advantage
technique and speed on the feet on the

524
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:32,410
ground.

525
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:34,720
It's all Pedro on the feed down all day.

526
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:35,471
I mean,

527
00:12:35,471 --> 00:12:39,160
Cody Garbrandt still only 27 years old
and still could be world champion again.

528
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:39,570
No,

529
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:40,480
no doubt about it.

530
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,920
Well three losses.

531
00:12:41,921 --> 00:12:42,671
Pedro Munoz.

532
00:12:42,671 --> 00:12:42,901
Okay.

533
00:12:42,901 --> 00:12:44,050
Can you played that game loss.

534
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,870
But then the other two are Tj Dillashaw.

535
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,360
Right.

536
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:46,721
Okay.

537
00:12:46,721 --> 00:12:47,890
Still the champ has your number.

538
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,753
Who gives a fuck?

539
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,420
And in both of those fights
he hurt Tj Dillashaw.

540
00:12:52,421 --> 00:12:55,870
He's just gotta be more cautious
and fight more technical,

541
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:56,630
more disciplined.

542
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,190
Yeah.

543
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:57,560
You know,

544
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,393
I mean,

545
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:01,960
wouldn't be a bad idea to
get some mental coaching,

546
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:02,620
you know,

547
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,030
get some game plan coaching,

548
00:13:04,031 --> 00:13:05,080
which he might've been doing.

549
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:05,920
I don't know.

550
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,131
Yeah,

551
00:13:06,131 --> 00:13:06,371
I don't know.

552
00:13:06,371 --> 00:13:07,300
I'm just speculating.

553
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,640
I don't know who he's training
his striking with either.

554
00:13:09,641 --> 00:13:10,690
But you know,

555
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:14,860
to mix things up more and be more
unpredictable would also be a good thing.

556
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:15,100
I mean,

557
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:15,631
obviously the,

558
00:13:15,631 --> 00:13:15,941
the,

559
00:13:15,941 --> 00:13:19,000
the last exchanges were
just not predictable at all.

560
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:19,720
It's fun for,

561
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,170
I mean,

562
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,120
not unpredictable,

563
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,180
all fully predictable.

564
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,021
Just right hand,

565
00:13:23,021 --> 00:13:23,441
right hand,

566
00:13:23,441 --> 00:13:23,900
right hand,

567
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,000
just chaos.

568
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,400
You know,

569
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,810
and think about his last one.

570
00:13:27,811 --> 00:13:29,170
He beat Dominic Cruz,

571
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:29,741
which is,

572
00:13:29,741 --> 00:13:31,780
you've got to be cerebral
in that fight to be done.

573
00:13:31,781 --> 00:13:32,280
The cruise.

574
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:32,651
Yeah.

575
00:13:32,651 --> 00:13:33,880
He had Dom's number.

576
00:13:33,881 --> 00:13:34,170
I mean,

577
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:35,530
and it was a different kind of fighting.

578
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,101
It's interesting.

579
00:13:36,101 --> 00:13:40,000
Dom said that he did the exact
thing that Cody did in their fight,

580
00:13:40,001 --> 00:13:42,250
that he got hit and he got
emotional and he fought reckless.

581
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:42,961
Dom did.

582
00:13:42,961 --> 00:13:43,141
Yeah.

583
00:13:43,141 --> 00:13:44,350
And that Tom went after Cody.

584
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:45,550
Yeah.

585
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:45,851
He said,

586
00:13:45,851 --> 00:13:46,571
I know what it's like.

587
00:13:46,571 --> 00:13:46,841
You just,

588
00:13:46,841 --> 00:13:48,400
you lose your game plan and you start,

589
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:49,870
you get wild.

590
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:51,003
Yeah.

591
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:51,971
It's just,

592
00:13:51,971 --> 00:13:54,610
it's hard to see him get Kayo
three times in a row like that.

593
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,990
He's going to be fine.

594
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:56,861
I hope so.

595
00:13:56,861 --> 00:13:57,610
He's going to be fine.

596
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:58,130
I hope so.

597
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:58,870
Who learned from it?

598
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:59,681
But here's the thing,

599
00:13:59,681 --> 00:14:00,310
when you're ranked,

600
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,870
was he number two in that division?

601
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,100
It's not like,

602
00:14:03,101 --> 00:14:03,401
all right,

603
00:14:03,401 --> 00:14:04,570
let's give you a warm up fight.

604
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:05,710
Like it's not boxing.

605
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,740
There's no warm ups.

606
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,960
He's going to get Jimmy Rivera or
fucking stir aljamain and mean.

607
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,053
Yeah.

608
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:13,480
It's like,

609
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,050
and you know those guys might argue that
they don't want him because he's lost

610
00:14:17,051 --> 00:14:17,860
three times in a row.

611
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,370
Jimmy Rivera's come off a loss too.

612
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:19,960
That's true.

613
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,490
Sterling actually called him out,

614
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,810
which is weird cause he's ranked,

615
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,640
you know he's ranked five I think,

616
00:14:24,641 --> 00:14:25,600
but he's coming off a win,

617
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,733
you know a huge one.

618
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:29,860
So with sterling sterling
called out Covington.

619
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:30,703
Yeah,

620
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,810
I mean um,

621
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:32,230
Brant.

622
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:32,670
Yeah,

623
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:33,460
yeah.

624
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:36,670
I'm saying Colby Covington already cause
I'm already thinking that much about

625
00:14:36,671 --> 00:14:37,810
him and that marketing.

626
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:38,500
Yeah,

627
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,610
well he's good at talking shit and getting
his name out there and it's the best

628
00:14:42,611 --> 00:14:45,850
thing for the welterweight
division right now.

629
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:48,520
After [inaudible] just
dominated Tyron Woodley,

630
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:50,710
I was blown away by that fight.

631
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,990
Me Loan a one hour

632
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:52,661
texting each other.

633
00:14:52,661 --> 00:14:56,030
It's weird cause I had people around the
house to watch the fights and they were

634
00:14:56,031 --> 00:14:56,211
like,

635
00:14:56,211 --> 00:14:56,511
God,

636
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,740
this fight so boring.

637
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,731
And I look online like,

638
00:14:58,731 --> 00:14:58,941
God,

639
00:14:58,941 --> 00:14:59,631
this is brutal.

640
00:14:59,631 --> 00:15:00,464
I'm like,

641
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,450
what the fuck are you talking about?

642
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:06,420
I was one of the greatest title fight
performances I've ever seen her.

643
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,410
For him to do that to
Woodley and dismantle him,

644
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:10,940
you don't understand.

645
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,290
You have no idea what you're watching.

646
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,240
It's fucking insane.

647
00:15:14,241 --> 00:15:16,370
It's not just insane
that he dismantled them,

648
00:15:16,371 --> 00:15:17,950
which is for sure insane,

649
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:22,960
but also his fucking gas tank Uzman was
pushing on the pedal for five fucking

650
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:25,971
rounds.

651
00:15:25,971 --> 00:15:27,140
Never let off the gas.

652
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:30,050
How about the way he looked in
between rounds went down to me,

653
00:15:30,051 --> 00:15:31,070
it was his mentality.

654
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,010
When you look from the first round,

655
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:33,381
she was,

656
00:15:33,381 --> 00:15:36,860
they break it up and then you
ready standing there like this.

657
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:37,161
I'm like,

658
00:15:37,161 --> 00:15:37,431
oh,

659
00:15:37,431 --> 00:15:37,910
she was,

660
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:40,790
do you know that word was
that he had a fractured foot?

661
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:41,450
Correct.

662
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:44,390
So he took a fucking cortisone
shot coming into that fight.

663
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:45,950
Imagine that savage.

664
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:49,340
Imagine that and still no
problems with his endurance.

665
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:52,640
Apparently didn't train the whole
week of just didn't do shit.

666
00:15:52,641 --> 00:15:53,370
Still made the weight.

667
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,051
No problem.

668
00:15:54,051 --> 00:15:55,250
But think about what he has to do.

669
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,230
His coach is going,

670
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:56,560
I,

671
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,500
you got to go in there.

672
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,760
You got to out grapple.

673
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,530
How maneuvered Tyron Woodley,

674
00:16:00,531 --> 00:16:02,030
who's one of the best
welterweights of all time?

675
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:02,181
Well,

676
00:16:02,181 --> 00:16:02,361
he,

677
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:03,520
how does he get taken down?

678
00:16:03,521 --> 00:16:04,900
How did empties and get taken down?

679
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:05,840
Who doesn't get taken down?

680
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,280
Literally also was kind of,

681
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:08,871
I dunno,

682
00:16:08,871 --> 00:16:10,460
he's 37 I don't know if it's,

683
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,590
he just didn't show up what happened,

684
00:16:12,591 --> 00:16:16,150
but he's 36 [inaudible] 36 either way.

685
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,420
Either way.

686
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,650
He's been doing it for a hot second.

687
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,320
This is why I feel bad for wood thing.

688
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:21,650
Maybe you know Joe,

689
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:26,390
but Woodley was always that guy
where he didn't get along with Dana.

690
00:16:26,391 --> 00:16:27,860
He was kind of difficult to deal with,

691
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:30,200
did it his way and made some demands.

692
00:16:30,201 --> 00:16:32,630
One of the big fight and then
it never happened for him.

693
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:33,763
He just,

694
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:35,330
he was in a big draw and,

695
00:16:35,331 --> 00:16:37,310
but he could get away with
that when he was champ.

696
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:40,190
Right now that he's not champ
the road frame to get back,

697
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,660
it's going to be so fucking tough.

698
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:41,900
Right.

699
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,590
Because of what he did when he was champ.

700
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,580
That's why I feel bad for Woodley and
he's one of the greatest to ever do it.

701
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:47,900
He is one of the greatest to ever do it.

702
00:16:47,901 --> 00:16:49,850
And I was making the argument
before this fight that he,

703
00:16:49,851 --> 00:16:53,710
you could obviously you could argue that
if he beats Huseman he is the greater

704
00:16:53,711 --> 00:16:54,110
correct.

705
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:54,760
He's in the,

706
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:54,940
the,

707
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,390
the greatest is George Saint Pierre,

708
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:56,781
right?

709
00:16:56,781 --> 00:16:59,330
He was a legend at welterweight.

710
00:16:59,480 --> 00:16:59,751
You,

711
00:16:59,751 --> 00:17:01,130
you look at his career,

712
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,530
I mean how many years was George Chamfer?

713
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,970
Was it six years or something crazy?

714
00:17:04,971 --> 00:17:05,660
They had the most title.

715
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,770
So you have George,

716
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:11,420
Matt Hughes and Woodley Matthews has
legend status because he was the original,

717
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:11,961
right?

718
00:17:11,961 --> 00:17:12,800
He was,

719
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:17,420
I mean he was the first wrestler that
really developed rock solid submission

720
00:17:17,421 --> 00:17:18,254
skills.

721
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,300
The F the fights with frank Trigg.

722
00:17:20,301 --> 00:17:20,630
The,

723
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:21,920
I mean he,

724
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:22,400
when he,

725
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:22,701
um,

726
00:17:22,701 --> 00:17:24,950
armbar George Saint Pierre
and their first fight,

727
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,360
I mean he was amazing.

728
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,840
But then the new school was George,

729
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:30,111
you know,

730
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,480
George was the best
welterweight of all time.

731
00:17:32,481 --> 00:17:34,120
But I was saying that the,

732
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,810
he's in the running right now.

733
00:17:35,811 --> 00:17:37,340
If you consider the opponents,

734
00:17:37,341 --> 00:17:38,750
he beat Wonderboy twice,

735
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,010
knocks out Robbie Lawler,

736
00:17:40,011 --> 00:17:40,844
the win the title,

737
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,980
and then goes on from there.

738
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,780
Beats Damien Maia.

739
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:45,590
Um,

740
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,460
I mean you,

741
00:17:46,461 --> 00:17:50,460
you look at how he beat Darren till for
some he was an underdog and then Darren

742
00:17:50,461 --> 00:17:50,821
till fight,

743
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:53,230
which didn't make any sense to
me cause I thought everybody,

744
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,153
it,

745
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,290
I got excited too.

746
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:55,781
I thought Dan,

747
00:17:55,781 --> 00:17:57,300
until is gonna win that really?

748
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,940
I did see I thought
Darren tills very good,

749
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,200
but I did not too much.

750
00:18:01,201 --> 00:18:02,370
I never saw him on the ground.

751
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,500
I never saw a real wrestler take
him down and ground and pound.

752
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:08,730
I didn't know what he had off his bass
there until it can be a prompt for

753
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,573
Huseman.

754
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:12,120
What really is size?

755
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:12,361
Yeah,

756
00:18:12,361 --> 00:18:14,970
I think it's going to prom and
Dan has committed to one seven.

757
00:18:14,971 --> 00:18:15,691
He still is.

758
00:18:15,691 --> 00:18:16,260
He still,

759
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,930
I think that especially
now that one 70 cause what?

760
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,850
What is if you are a fan of fighting,

761
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:21,721
what is fun?

762
00:18:21,721 --> 00:18:23,970
Is Woodley be an out the
welterweight division.

763
00:18:23,971 --> 00:18:24,810
So Fun,

764
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,330
right?

765
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:25,740
Because now,

766
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:25,941
Ooh,

767
00:18:25,941 --> 00:18:26,820
spin Colby,

768
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:29,660
you got Ben at Ben Ascar in there now.

769
00:18:29,661 --> 00:18:31,770
Now Deron till has a
shot to be a champion.

770
00:18:31,771 --> 00:18:31,840
Well,

771
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,371
I'll tell you what,

772
00:18:32,371 --> 00:18:34,560
even though Robbie Lawler lost that fight,

773
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:35,341
God damn,

774
00:18:35,341 --> 00:18:36,174
he looked good.

775
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:37,770
He looked good physically,

776
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,611
like at the way,

777
00:18:38,611 --> 00:18:40,260
and he looked Jack Best
I've ever seen him.

778
00:18:40,261 --> 00:18:40,951
He looked amazing.

779
00:18:40,951 --> 00:18:43,450
Apparently he had a tremendous
strength and conditioning routine.

780
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:44,311
Yeah.

781
00:18:44,311 --> 00:18:47,630
He looked real good and he was
fighting fucking for Roche.

782
00:18:47,631 --> 00:18:49,320
It's like the Robbie Lawler of old,

783
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:55,040
he didn't look at all diminished and I
think maybe the time off was good for him

784
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,720
because he had to get a ACL surgery.

785
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:58,120
Yeah.

786
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,950
So it might have been dealing with
something before his last fight.

787
00:19:01,951 --> 00:19:02,760
We don't know.

788
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,930
Do you think maybe it was to where
Ben Adkins very so one dimensional.

789
00:19:06,931 --> 00:19:08,970
He didn't have to worry
about the striking at all.

790
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:09,840
Um,

791
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,940
there's a little bit of that for sure.

792
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:15,690
But the fucking fight started because
he launched Ben Astroneer to the ants.

793
00:19:15,691 --> 00:19:17,010
Slammed him on his fucking head,

794
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:20,070
which was crazy then and tough as shit.

795
00:19:20,071 --> 00:19:20,641
Here's the other thing.

796
00:19:20,641 --> 00:19:21,450
Yes.

797
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:22,800
Ben One controversially,

798
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,990
we don't know that there was still what,

799
00:19:24,991 --> 00:19:26,340
two minutes left in that fight,

800
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:26,611
dude,

801
00:19:26,611 --> 00:19:30,060
I've been watching their
dog with that much time.

802
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:32,950
It could've got pretty
dice for fucking um,

803
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,833
uh,

804
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,150
uh,

805
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,500
Robbie Lawler a dicey.

806
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:39,480
We can't just Chaco Benz.

807
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:40,230
Uh,

808
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:40,740
Ben,

809
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,750
I think you put it on his
Twitter or his Instagram page.

810
00:19:42,751 --> 00:19:46,050
We see Robbie Lawler's arm
go limp to Dick goes limp.

811
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,550
Now here's the question.

812
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:51,780
Did it go limp because he just let it
go cause he was trying to like let you

813
00:19:51,781 --> 00:19:51,901
know,

814
00:19:51,901 --> 00:19:55,950
just let it go cause he's trying to
like that's hang on cause the choke.

815
00:19:55,951 --> 00:19:57,320
He was like he's squeezing really hard,

816
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,350
is going to tire his arms out.

817
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:03,000
Robbie said it wasn't under his chin now
but here's the thing and this is people

818
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:05,250
need to stop saying that you
have to be under the chin.

819
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,470
Could choke a guy unconscious.

820
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,020
You can do both.

821
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,780
You can choke a guy on
conscious across his face for,

822
00:20:09,781 --> 00:20:11,310
she can go across the face,

823
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,540
right like this.

824
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:14,250
If you have a real squeeze,

825
00:20:14,251 --> 00:20:16,290
you have like a Marcello Garcia squeeze.

826
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:17,370
You could put a guy asleep.

827
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,570
Think I'll strong Ben is to,

828
00:20:18,571 --> 00:20:20,070
Ben has a real squeeze,

829
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:21,300
phenomenal squeeze.

830
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:23,730
Strange and he's in this position.

831
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:24,870
Would that bulldog,

832
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,360
you can get a lot of
leverage in that position.

833
00:20:27,361 --> 00:20:27,511
I mean,

834
00:20:27,511 --> 00:20:31,470
I don't know how he's gripping
as how much torque the torque.

835
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:36,240
So I don't know if he went out and then
band let them go a little bit and then

836
00:20:36,241 --> 00:20:37,680
he popped right back awake.

837
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,850
That's what he's saying.

838
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,770
You're your natural movement though.

839
00:20:40,771 --> 00:20:41,550
If you go,

840
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,840
if you're fighting a choke,

841
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:46,680
your your natural Mr. Hold
onto it is not to go lip.

842
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,500
That's,

843
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,130
that's true.

844
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:48,963
That's why I'm like,

845
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:49,960
maybe he was out.

846
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:50,830
We thought he was out.

847
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:51,610
Yeah,

848
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:52,241
he thought he was out.

849
00:20:52,241 --> 00:20:53,350
But in all fairness,

850
00:20:53,351 --> 00:20:55,910
I thought Ben was out
earlier me to or not.

851
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,210
They're going to stop there.

852
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,570
We're stopping Robbie slamming.

853
00:20:58,571 --> 00:20:58,781
I'm like,

854
00:20:58,781 --> 00:20:59,171
he's out.

855
00:20:59,171 --> 00:20:59,561
He's out.

856
00:20:59,561 --> 00:20:59,801
He was,

857
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:00,050
fuck.

858
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:00,641
I thought he was out,

859
00:21:00,641 --> 00:21:01,361
but damn,

860
00:21:01,361 --> 00:21:02,440
he can take a fucking shot.

861
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,240
He can take a fucking shot.

862
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:08,680
Robbie hitting one somamers
hosts nervous for that fight.

863
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:09,461
Ooh,

864
00:21:09,461 --> 00:21:10,090
it's crazy.

865
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:13,300
We've had him up so much love so much.

866
00:21:13,301 --> 00:21:14,890
And when he came to Daddy's do Goober,

867
00:21:14,891 --> 00:21:15,760
dad bod,

868
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,300
I was like,

869
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:16,481
damn,

870
00:21:16,481 --> 00:21:17,650
this justice terrible,

871
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:18,910
but let's figure this out.

872
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:21,641
Let's see.

873
00:21:21,641 --> 00:21:23,050
Do you have a video of it?

874
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,550
Check both of his pages.

875
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:26,440
I don't see he posted it.

876
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:28,150
He posted it today.

877
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,470
I think it was a Twitter.

878
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:29,981
Yeah,

879
00:21:29,981 --> 00:21:34,570
I think it was Twitter and I think
maybe he might've either re posted it or

880
00:21:34,571 --> 00:21:37,870
replied to it or repost it with a comment.

881
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,081
Oh,

882
00:21:38,081 --> 00:21:40,810
he says this is what happened and
it's in the conscious to comment.

883
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:41,411
Okay,

884
00:21:41,411 --> 00:21:43,240
well let's see it when he
said this is what happened.

885
00:21:43,241 --> 00:21:46,630
Then go to whatever he was commenting
on the hand and you'll see the video

886
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,470
whenever he was commenting
on is the video the only,

887
00:21:50,471 --> 00:21:52,810
basically they were saying
that in the video that he see.

888
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:53,644
Let's check it out here.

889
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:54,821
Jack Sparrow.

890
00:21:54,821 --> 00:21:55,654
There it goes.

891
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:56,800
See carefully.

892
00:21:56,801 --> 00:22:00,730
You'll see that Ben loosen his
chalk chalk choke a little bit,

893
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:01,990
and then herb dean touch.

894
00:22:01,991 --> 00:22:02,824
Click on that.

895
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,450
Click on that goes to a long thread.

896
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:04,841
Yeah,

897
00:22:04,841 --> 00:22:06,040
but if you go to the top of that thread,

898
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:06,874
you'll see the video.

899
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,100
There it is right there
at the top right there.

900
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,450
Watch this.

901
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:11,350
So check this out.

902
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:12,503
Look at the arm.

903
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,600
See that right there.

904
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:14,830
That's not a normal move up,

905
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:15,061
but,

906
00:22:15,061 --> 00:22:15,820
but look,

907
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,860
but Robbie does give them the thumbs up.

908
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,680
That's the other thing that you're not
seeing that it's not a normal movement,

909
00:22:20,681 --> 00:22:22,840
but it is a tight squeeze.

910
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:26,500
It does look like his arm went limp.

911
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:27,670
I think it went out for a second.

912
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,020
Got In camp and came to,

913
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:29,261
well,

914
00:22:29,261 --> 00:22:30,190
herb said,

915
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:35,350
what herb is saying is he told Bam
to stop when the arm went limp,

916
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,191
when the arm went.

917
00:22:36,191 --> 00:22:40,570
Lynn Ben said is that he's lightening
up and then he lightened up and then

918
00:22:40,571 --> 00:22:41,710
Robbie came back to life.

919
00:22:41,711 --> 00:22:42,190
That's fair.

920
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:43,630
That is entirely possible,

921
00:22:43,631 --> 00:22:44,110
folks.

922
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,280
It's entirely possible.

923
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,180
I do not know.

924
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:50,410
But I do know that Robby Lawler is a
classy motherfucker because he complained

925
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:50,740
for a little.

926
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,060
Say what the fuck does all right man,

927
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:52,781
good job.

928
00:22:52,781 --> 00:22:53,201
Good fight.

929
00:22:53,201 --> 00:22:54,520
He's been in the game
so long and he's like,

930
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:55,331
he can see him.

931
00:22:55,331 --> 00:22:55,900
He goes out,

932
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:56,790
he's got to grind.

933
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,030
He's got a great attitude.

934
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,080
He really does.

935
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,190
He's got a great attitude.

936
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:00,801
And uh,

937
00:23:00,801 --> 00:23:02,470
I don't think it stock
dropped in that fight.

938
00:23:02,471 --> 00:23:03,400
I really don't know.

939
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:03,820
No,

940
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,271
I really don't.

941
00:23:04,271 --> 00:23:05,590
And I would like to see the rematch.

942
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:06,843
I don't,

943
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:07,151
well,

944
00:23:07,151 --> 00:23:07,984
I want to see it again.

945
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:08,261
I mean,

946
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:09,160
he says no,

947
00:23:09,161 --> 00:23:10,470
but Ben Says No.

948
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:10,960
Yeah.

949
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,730
Ben Says he didn't want to
fight him in the first place.

950
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,330
Why would you write a fucking murderer?

951
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:18,400
But he was so amped up for that fight too.

952
00:23:18,401 --> 00:23:20,350
So angry and like you
could see in his face.

953
00:23:20,351 --> 00:23:21,250
He knew what this meant.

954
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:21,611
Dude.

955
00:23:21,611 --> 00:23:26,611
How about Ben versus Uzman
mother fucking fight shit.

956
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,441
Oh Damn.

957
00:23:28,441 --> 00:23:29,200
Until yeah,

958
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:29,471
Ben,

959
00:23:29,471 --> 00:23:30,011
your performance,

960
00:23:30,011 --> 00:23:30,371
your shit.

961
00:23:30,371 --> 00:23:31,061
You barely one.

962
00:23:31,061 --> 00:23:31,631
Your ugliest.

963
00:23:31,631 --> 00:23:32,464
Fuck.

964
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:35,290
Your Chin is too big not to miss.

965
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:37,060
You have no respect for no one.

966
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:37,570
Oh,

967
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:39,220
did I say your curly headed fuck.

968
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,091
See in London,

969
00:23:40,091 --> 00:23:43,410
muppet well till has a tough
fight in London though too.

970
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:43,900
Yeah.

971
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:44,561
Mazda dolls.

972
00:23:44,561 --> 00:23:45,394
No joke.

973
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,010
Mazda dolls.

974
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:47,270
A very technical guy.

975
00:23:47,271 --> 00:23:48,860
He's got a wrestling to men.

976
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,340
He's getting everything very good at
everything and very good wrestling.

977
00:23:52,341 --> 00:23:55,520
And I think that's probably where he's
going to try to put Darren till after

978
00:23:55,521 --> 00:23:56,360
that Woodley fight.

979
00:23:56,361 --> 00:23:57,620
He said that's a tough life.

980
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:00,020
It's a bad situation for Woodley man.

981
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:04,460
Because a you're gonna people are gonna
say oh he was doing all that stuff with

982
00:24:04,461 --> 00:24:05,420
TMC.

983
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,880
Oh he's got a rap album coming up.

984
00:24:07,881 --> 00:24:09,230
He's opening for he's,

985
00:24:09,231 --> 00:24:11,060
he's doing rap concerts fair though.

986
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:11,340
Right?

987
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:11,450
Yeah.

988
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:11,810
That's fair.

989
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:16,400
That's fair criticism cause cause I've
always been on that side of you and you

990
00:24:16,401 --> 00:24:17,211
know more than anyone.

991
00:24:17,211 --> 00:24:20,180
He told me to get the fuck out
cause when you're one foot in.

992
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:20,600
Yup.

993
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,930
Cause what's instrument doing when
Woodley's in the studio going hard,

994
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,480
going hard was men is all in.

995
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:27,290
He's all in.

996
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:28,310
You think who's been wants show.

997
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:32,420
If I can wait up do's and be like hey
dude I'll pay for a show free on Tmz to go

998
00:24:32,421 --> 00:24:33,400
get the fuck out my face.

999
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:35,060
Fuck out of my face.

1000
00:24:35,061 --> 00:24:35,871
That's what he's going to say.

1001
00:24:35,871 --> 00:24:37,160
Get the fuck you probably get angry at.

1002
00:24:37,161 --> 00:24:38,750
You get the fuck out of my face.

1003
00:24:38,751 --> 00:24:40,340
That TMZ shit dude.

1004
00:24:40,341 --> 00:24:40,730
I was,

1005
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:43,370
I was telling everybody for years,

1006
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:46,190
people have been scared
of Huseman for years.

1007
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:48,720
But now you see why now you see,

1008
00:24:48,721 --> 00:24:50,570
before you were seeing
people were scared of him,

1009
00:24:50,571 --> 00:24:51,860
but he wasn't beating anybody.

1010
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,910
That was world class.

1011
00:24:52,911 --> 00:24:53,480
He wasn't,

1012
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,390
he wasn't getting those top 10 guys.

1013
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:55,680
Amy,

1014
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,480
Maya,

1015
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:56,840
right?

1016
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,081
Yeah.

1017
00:24:57,081 --> 00:25:01,610
We got dos saint to Damien Maia fight
will forever be marred by the fact they

1018
00:25:01,611 --> 00:25:05,390
separated them when Damien had one
hook and he was trying to take us back,

1019
00:25:05,391 --> 00:25:07,130
dude was that fucking homeboy,

1020
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:10,450
the guy who kept saying on
come up with that daughter,

1021
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:11,780
oh my God,

1022
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:12,650
I don't know what he's doing.

1023
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,630
Or you didn't see who that was?

1024
00:25:14,631 --> 00:25:18,590
Go go to a Damien Maia versus um,

1025
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,870
Kamara Huseman and see who,

1026
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,040
who separated them.

1027
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:23,240
Cause the Ref Matt,

1028
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:23,630
uh,

1029
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:23,901
Matt,

1030
00:25:23,901 --> 00:25:26,330
the Terra Sarah was going
fucking crazy about that.

1031
00:25:26,331 --> 00:25:27,920
And he's 100% right.

1032
00:25:27,921 --> 00:25:30,380
Do you know how difficult it
is to get ahold of a guy like,

1033
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:30,531
Ooh,

1034
00:25:30,531 --> 00:25:31,251
spawn like that?

1035
00:25:31,251 --> 00:25:35,420
And to have one hook in standing up and
to be working to take his back and for

1036
00:25:35,421 --> 00:25:36,201
them to separate him,

1037
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,250
it is nonsense.

1038
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,090
Pure nonsense.

1039
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:39,260
How much harder it is.

1040
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:39,920
That's hard.

1041
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,100
Yeah.

1042
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,740
How much heart is to take
Woodley down in control?

1043
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:43,350
Yes.

1044
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,750
And as you stand them up.

1045
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,230
Yup.

1046
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:45,440
Yup.

1047
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:45,921
If I'm Moose,

1048
00:25:45,921 --> 00:25:46,131
man,

1049
00:25:46,131 --> 00:25:47,390
what the fuck are you doing?

1050
00:25:47,391 --> 00:25:47,480
Do.

1051
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:47,580
Yeah,

1052
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,450
but it mean you stop and think
that you should come down.

1053
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:51,590
You stop and think about Damien Maia,

1054
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:52,400
his last fight.

1055
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:52,611
Right?

1056
00:25:52,611 --> 00:25:53,030
Who the fuck?

1057
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:55,370
Who the fuck did he just
choked unconscious fuck out of?

1058
00:25:55,371 --> 00:25:56,120
Who was that?

1059
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:56,601
Who Was it?

1060
00:25:56,601 --> 00:25:57,381
Who did you just choke out?

1061
00:25:57,381 --> 00:25:58,214
Someone really good.

1062
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,100
A young kid that they fed.

1063
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:01,401
Okay.

1064
00:26:01,401 --> 00:26:02,030
So here it is.

1065
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:02,840
That's not Goddard.

1066
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,673
Who is it?

1067
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:04,270
Uh,

1068
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,150
is the bald feller.

1069
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,650
Which bald feller?

1070
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:08,443
So here's,

1071
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:09,560
um,

1072
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,490
so here's a,

1073
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,890
it's hard to tell who that referee is.

1074
00:26:13,891 --> 00:26:14,724
I can't see the face.

1075
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,830
So it loose man in them.

1076
00:26:16,831 --> 00:26:17,061
They're,

1077
00:26:17,061 --> 00:26:18,690
they're exchanging ooze.

1078
00:26:18,691 --> 00:26:19,524
My cracked him.

1079
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:20,873
Who is it?

1080
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:22,320
Is it Chris Taione?

1081
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:24,000
I know two referees.

1082
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:24,571
I know three.

1083
00:26:24,571 --> 00:26:25,250
No.

1084
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:25,630
Um,

1085
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:26,463
it's Leon.

1086
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,493
Yeah.

1087
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:31,773
Okay.

1088
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:33,820
Well for whatever reason,

1089
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:35,110
what was God thinking though?

1090
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:35,891
I don't know what he was.

1091
00:26:35,891 --> 00:26:36,201
Thank you.

1092
00:26:36,201 --> 00:26:38,650
And then he's shade online at Jon Anik.

1093
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:39,720
What did he say?

1094
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,050
Seeing your commentary was off.

1095
00:26:41,051 --> 00:26:41,890
So was annex.

1096
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,340
You got my commentary on?

1097
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:43,850
Yeah.

1098
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:44,610
Okay.

1099
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:46,920
I don't know what I did to say.

1100
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,140
I didn't say anything
bad about Mark Goddard.

1101
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:49,681
I said I don't,

1102
00:26:49,681 --> 00:26:50,850
I disagree with them standing up.

1103
00:26:50,851 --> 00:26:52,500
I don't know why he said
the commentary was off,

1104
00:26:52,501 --> 00:26:56,400
but Dominick Cruz did say
that he can't wrestle.

1105
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:59,370
And the reason why he's standing
him up his cause he can't wrestle.

1106
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:00,630
Mark honored.

1107
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:01,080
Yes.

1108
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:01,380
No,

1109
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:01,991
he said that he's,

1110
00:27:01,991 --> 00:27:03,270
he was saying that about Mark Goddard.

1111
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:03,701
Correct.

1112
00:27:03,701 --> 00:27:04,920
We've seen the referee can't wrestle.

1113
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:05,731
He threw shade.

1114
00:27:05,731 --> 00:27:06,110
It got her.

1115
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:06,850
I,

1116
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:08,090
I'm nothing but respect for God.

1117
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:11,400
Although I don't agree with
his decision in that fight.

1118
00:27:11,401 --> 00:27:12,870
I do not agree with standups.

1119
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:14,120
I don't like stand up higher.

1120
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:14,820
Your Garden.

1121
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,350
I do too.

1122
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:17,430
He's a great referee in that moment.

1123
00:27:17,431 --> 00:27:18,264
He's wrong.

1124
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:18,661
Well,

1125
00:27:18,661 --> 00:27:19,890
he's probably very emotional.

1126
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:20,971
Listen,

1127
00:27:20,971 --> 00:27:24,960
your job is not to intervene with the
trajectory of the fight when your job is

1128
00:27:24,961 --> 00:27:25,920
to protect the fighters.

1129
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,030
No one fuck up.

1130
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:27,151
Ooh.

1131
00:27:27,151 --> 00:27:27,984
Spins.

1132
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,920
Biggest fight of his life by standing up.

1133
00:27:29,921 --> 00:27:30,840
Because what happens this,

1134
00:27:30,841 --> 00:27:31,650
and we've seen it.

1135
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,120
Labs if be stood them up and he goes,

1136
00:27:33,121 --> 00:27:33,511
you know what,

1137
00:27:33,511 --> 00:27:33,811
fine.

1138
00:27:33,811 --> 00:27:34,530
I feel good.

1139
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:35,190
Knocks him out.

1140
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,023
Right.

1141
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,013
You got it.

1142
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:37,913
It can happen.

1143
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,420
It can't happen.

1144
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,440
What did he say about me?

1145
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,090
He didn't specifically call you off.

1146
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:44,853
What'd he say?

1147
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:52,100
Where did the only thing wildly
inconsistent is your and your cocoms

1148
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,440
commentators like election
observation of actual events.

1149
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:57,330
I will book Joe Rogan's ass.

1150
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,020
That's wrong.

1151
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,100
That's so rude.

1152
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,143
I didn't see that.

1153
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:01,020
I just made that up.

1154
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:06,020
The only thing wildly inconsistent is
your and your cocoms recollection and

1155
00:28:07,321 --> 00:28:09,180
observation of actual events.

1156
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,800
I'll save my side for later.

1157
00:28:10,801 --> 00:28:10,921
Well,

1158
00:28:10,921 --> 00:28:12,120
that doesn't make any sense.

1159
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,610
Recollection of actual events.

1160
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:16,740
I don't know what he's trying
to say there and cocoms.

1161
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,440
I didn't say anything bad
about him other than that.

1162
00:28:18,441 --> 00:28:20,640
I don't agree with the standups job.

1163
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:24,600
Dominick Cruz said that he can't wrestle
and I don't know if mark got Russell.

1164
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:28,020
I know he knows how to referee
this compared to Dominick Cruz.

1165
00:28:28,021 --> 00:28:29,070
He cannot wrestle,

1166
00:28:29,071 --> 00:28:29,591
so dom,

1167
00:28:29,591 --> 00:28:30,600
it's fine to say that,

1168
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:32,460
but also John Annika
and harden the paints.

1169
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:32,940
Awesome.

1170
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:33,301
Yeah,

1171
00:28:33,301 --> 00:28:34,950
I like that you are way off.

1172
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:35,813
What's wildly,

1173
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,230
wildly inconsistent is correct.

1174
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:39,900
Cause Herb Dean is the gold
standard in my opinion.

1175
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:40,980
And Herb Dean,

1176
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,360
even though he,

1177
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:45,150
that thing with Robbie
Lawler is controversial,

1178
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,710
kind of look at it and I go,

1179
00:28:46,711 --> 00:28:47,580
the arm went limp.

1180
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:48,750
I can see how he made that.

1181
00:28:48,751 --> 00:28:48,960
I said,

1182
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,680
see that?

1183
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,513
I could see,

1184
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:53,250
I think it's unfortunate and
it may have been a mistake,

1185
00:28:53,251 --> 00:28:54,360
but it might not have been a mistake.

1186
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,110
I,

1187
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:55,511
I'm,

1188
00:28:55,511 --> 00:28:55,690
I'm,

1189
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:56,270
I'm still,

1190
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:58,200
I'm still glad I'm not at all not,

1191
00:28:58,201 --> 00:28:59,034
hey look man,

1192
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,730
his job his fucking way harder
than mine a hundred times harder.

1193
00:29:02,731 --> 00:29:06,750
Heard Herb Dean's job is to protect
the fighters and to stop fights to make

1194
00:29:06,751 --> 00:29:07,470
calls.

1195
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:10,740
I don't want to be that guy that I
thought that guy gets fucking hated on it.

1196
00:29:10,741 --> 00:29:12,030
Never loved herb.

1197
00:29:12,031 --> 00:29:13,200
Never gets low and like something,

1198
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,400
don't know whenever it gets love,

1199
00:29:14,401 --> 00:29:16,330
but with mark daughter
don't be the guy tried to,

1200
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:17,820
John replied,

1201
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,301
he said,

1202
00:29:18,301 --> 00:29:19,590
I always try to be respectful.

1203
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,330
We just call it like we see it too.

1204
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,420
But there's an arrogance with
which you deal with the fighters,

1205
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,280
commentators and many in this sport.

1206
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,750
And I find it off putting,

1207
00:29:27,751 --> 00:29:28,290
Whoa,

1208
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:29,340
one man's take.

1209
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:34,520
And I'm quite sure you'll give yours
to for everyone to hear why I'm manic.

1210
00:29:34,741 --> 00:29:37,890
World Stone Am Dad.

1211
00:29:37,891 --> 00:29:39,210
I'm okay.

1212
00:29:39,211 --> 00:29:42,280
So I believe John Eck was offered to
the inconsistent between each referees

1213
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,290
decisions of when to
separate the fighters.

1214
00:29:44,291 --> 00:29:45,580
And John said exactly.

1215
00:29:45,581 --> 00:29:46,810
That's what I was referring to,

1216
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:50,080
that [inaudible] that
two of the consensus,

1217
00:29:50,081 --> 00:29:53,590
Beth best referees of the
game would handle those two
situations so differently.

1218
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:55,480
I understand the athletes are different,

1219
00:29:55,481 --> 00:29:56,830
but there are parallels to be drawn.

1220
00:29:56,831 --> 00:29:57,920
John is 100% correct.

1221
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,200
Hundred percent a hundred percent correct.

1222
00:29:59,201 --> 00:29:59,701
And I'm at us,

1223
00:29:59,701 --> 00:29:59,910
Bro.

1224
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:00,161
I'm,

1225
00:30:00,161 --> 00:30:00,461
I'm,

1226
00:30:00,461 --> 00:30:00,910
I'm,

1227
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:04,960
I feel bad that Mark Goddard respond
the way he did because it's not very

1228
00:30:04,961 --> 00:30:08,110
professional and I think it's very
emotional and I think he's probably just

1229
00:30:08,111 --> 00:30:08,944
feeling the heat.

1230
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,150
Yeah.

1231
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:10,930
Yeah.

1232
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:11,680
Hard on them.

1233
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:11,981
Yeah.

1234
00:30:11,981 --> 00:30:12,780
You feel that heat,

1235
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,613
you get angry,

1236
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:14,111
you know.

1237
00:30:14,111 --> 00:30:14,351
But,

1238
00:30:14,351 --> 00:30:14,561
uh,

1239
00:30:14,561 --> 00:30:15,750
I like Mark Goddard,

1240
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,060
a lack of Milan and I think he's a very
good refereeing top one or two reps in

1241
00:30:19,061 --> 00:30:19,540
the business.

1242
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,590
I love mark daughter.

1243
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:21,670
He fucked that up.

1244
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:26,320
My question is I wonder who is telling
them they should stand things up when

1245
00:30:26,321 --> 00:30:27,370
they shouldn't stand things up.

1246
00:30:27,371 --> 00:30:28,320
I wonder if pressure heath,

1247
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,950
the pressure he feels from the audience.

1248
00:30:29,951 --> 00:30:30,880
You think the crowd,

1249
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,150
maybe it could be that
British people are very nice.

1250
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:34,751
You know,

1251
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:36,210
sometimes in English people there

1252
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:41,440
when you got to worldclass wrestlers
and this guy's impossible take down.

1253
00:30:41,441 --> 00:30:42,460
He's won the best of all time.

1254
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:43,000
Yup.

1255
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,900
Let it go.

1256
00:30:43,901 --> 00:30:44,291
Let it go.

1257
00:30:44,291 --> 00:30:45,250
Well I think let it go.

1258
00:30:45,251 --> 00:30:45,851
Period.

1259
00:30:45,851 --> 00:30:46,241
I just,

1260
00:30:46,241 --> 00:30:50,120
I do not agree with standups cause I think
of a guy can hold you down like this.

1261
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:51,310
What I was saying about Ben Askern,

1262
00:30:51,311 --> 00:30:51,911
if guy look,

1263
00:30:51,911 --> 00:30:55,370
Ben asking can hold you down and give
you nuggies until the fights over.

1264
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,060
Yeah.

1265
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:56,893
Do something about it.

1266
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,441
Exactly.

1267
00:30:57,441 --> 00:30:58,230
You not cheating.

1268
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:58,620
No.

1269
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,500
If he's not cheating,

1270
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:00,100
keep it up.

1271
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:03,470
Do you know how hard it is to control
Woodley on the down and the only outside

1272
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,313
of fucking minutes?

1273
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,860
You have five minutes to sneak a choke in.

1274
00:31:05,861 --> 00:31:08,970
Five minutes to hold on to
him and beat him up and uh,

1275
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:09,850
look,

1276
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:10,121
look,

1277
00:31:10,121 --> 00:31:11,080
awkward it to this man.

1278
00:31:11,081 --> 00:31:12,340
He didn't even fucking care.

1279
00:31:12,341 --> 00:31:13,240
He got stood back up,

1280
00:31:13,241 --> 00:31:13,871
didn't complain.

1281
00:31:13,871 --> 00:31:15,760
We're right back at him and
took him down again and again.

1282
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,740
He's a monster.

1283
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,471
Went cool story,

1284
00:31:17,471 --> 00:31:17,950
Bro.

1285
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:20,830
He is fucking hard to deal with for Colby,

1286
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:23,140
for everyone on the planet earth.

1287
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:24,280
But stylistically,

1288
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,580
when you look at the fight for Colby,

1289
00:31:25,581 --> 00:31:26,030
Alec Ula,

1290
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:26,863
Colby does well.

1291
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:27,820
He does that.

1292
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:28,540
He does that.

1293
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:31,300
The thing about [inaudible]
is he's got power.

1294
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,770
He's got striking,

1295
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:34,000
he's got wrestling.

1296
00:31:34,001 --> 00:31:38,980
But even maybe more
importantly RDO for days here,

1297
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:41,970
oh is mine is a fucking bank fault.

1298
00:31:41,971 --> 00:31:46,240
It's Fort Knox not getting in the press.

1299
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,890
How adorable was it?

1300
00:31:47,891 --> 00:31:48,880
Him and his little daughter.

1301
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:49,780
Oh Dude,

1302
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:50,703
I almost cried.

1303
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:51,970
Just such a big chew.

1304
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:54,580
I'm such a bitch pussy that have kids.

1305
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:55,414
Me Too.

1306
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,433
Me Too.

1307
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:57,820
I'm like,

1308
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:58,450
oh,

1309
00:31:58,450 --> 00:31:58,910
I know.

1310
00:31:58,910 --> 00:31:59,743
So cute.

1311
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:03,900
And just how happy mom
and wife for real extra.

1312
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:05,123
They're like P diddy

1313
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:08,893
extra.

1314
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:10,383
Hey Manny,

1315
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,260
he's so bad in the world.

1316
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,850
Imagine what it feels like to have your
husband when the fucking world heavy

1317
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:18,700
world welterweight title to
beat Tyron Woodley knife block.

1318
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,230
My wife take a hot bath,

1319
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,480
the fuck out of here and my mom sure
as fuck wouldn't be in the case.

1320
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:28,050
Hey man,

1321
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:30,730
I feel like when someone wins like that
they could do whatever they want me.

1322
00:32:30,731 --> 00:32:32,490
Carter's mom's always in the cage is dads.

1323
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,780
She not fucking true.

1324
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:36,230
Throwing out promo codes.

1325
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:39,503
Listen man.

1326
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:41,020
Oops.

1327
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:41,301
Mine.

1328
00:32:41,301 --> 00:32:42,380
I feel like he's only like,

1329
00:32:42,381 --> 00:32:44,940
what is he 31 or 32 how old is he smiling?

1330
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,980
Ready to fucking sad.

1331
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:49,070
He can be the champ for a long time.

1332
00:32:49,071 --> 00:32:49,904
Scared me.

1333
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:52,070
He's not doing it in person.

1334
00:32:52,071 --> 00:32:52,940
Of course you have assessed,

1335
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:55,430
but when he's not cutting
on my palm beach show,

1336
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:55,910
I let,

1337
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:57,470
what the fuck are you doing?

1338
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,280
How much do you weigh?

1339
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:58,671
I don't know.

1340
00:32:58,671 --> 00:32:59,690
We were the same size.

1341
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,510
He's fucking huge.

1342
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:02,901
Well,

1343
00:33:02,901 --> 00:33:04,030
it gets you scared me.

1344
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,360
Size of he scared me.

1345
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,553
Well he's,

1346
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:11,660
but he's big like a super athlete
and not like a bodybuilder,

1347
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,040
which is on my face.

1348
00:33:13,041 --> 00:33:17,510
Goosmann what's the word like when
you look at the way Tyron is big?

1349
00:33:17,511 --> 00:33:18,500
Tyrons more thick.

1350
00:33:18,501 --> 00:33:19,810
Like his legs are fisherman.

1351
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,280
He Tarryn's fat.

1352
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:22,910
Look at it at the height difference.

1353
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:24,440
We get his fucking back.

1354
00:33:24,441 --> 00:33:25,850
Look at those so tall.

1355
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,210
Look out.

1356
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:28,520
Talia is men and wide.

1357
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:32,390
He looks scary where all these
paints were ogling at them.

1358
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,560
I'm on is not so much.

1359
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:40,010
These are monster that the face paint
thing was a last minute decision to Susie

1360
00:33:40,011 --> 00:33:41,900
had to do is face Susan the makeup lady.

1361
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,100
Should I do his face last year?

1362
00:33:43,101 --> 00:33:44,110
She has when she's the best.

1363
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,220
She's such a nice lady and she pitched,

1364
00:33:46,221 --> 00:33:48,500
they had to make sure that
they had the right color paint,

1365
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:48,741
you know,

1366
00:33:48,741 --> 00:33:50,300
to do the Nigerian flag on his face.

1367
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:51,290
Dude,

1368
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:53,150
he might be champ for a long time.

1369
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:54,850
There's a great match ups.

1370
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:55,810
Oh my God.

1371
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:59,900
Welterweight is so fucking fun
and don't sleep on Mazda da folks.

1372
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:03,950
You know Jorge Mas de Darle stills capable
of beating something in money fucked

1373
00:34:03,951 --> 00:34:07,560
up cowboy Ho Masala Dal is the real deal.

1374
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:08,840
The real deal.

1375
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,560
The Darren tail man,

1376
00:34:10,561 --> 00:34:11,510
he's my dark horse.

1377
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:15,320
You still think so unless he
goes 85 but he's a motherfucker.

1378
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,840
You know what happened in
that till fight with Woodley.

1379
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:22,130
He didn't land a single
significant strike in two rounds.

1380
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:25,520
He didn't rent anything in the first
round and he didn't land anything in the

1381
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:26,270
second round.

1382
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:29,420
Just understand that this is the big show.

1383
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:31,190
This is the world title shot.

1384
00:34:31,191 --> 00:34:32,720
You come out to fucking Neil diamond,

1385
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:33,560
sweet Caroline.

1386
00:34:33,561 --> 00:34:34,180
The whole deal.

1387
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,830
Everybody's singing along to wonder.

1388
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:36,590
That's London,

1389
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:37,423
but,

1390
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:38,443
but,

1391
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:40,490
but he lands nothing.

1392
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,150
All right,

1393
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:44,450
well here's this Woodley threw
one punch and five rounds.

1394
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:44,691
No,

1395
00:34:44,691 --> 00:34:45,230
that's not true.

1396
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,063
It happened.

1397
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,271
Literally hit him.

1398
00:34:47,271 --> 00:34:48,230
He was very tentative.

1399
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:48,501
He,

1400
00:34:48,501 --> 00:34:50,780
well he was doing the smart thing.

1401
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:54,290
The smart thing is you wait
and you counter because
Woodley's so God damn fast,

1402
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:56,390
that smart thing paid off when he landed.

1403
00:34:56,391 --> 00:34:58,190
That big right hand dropped him.

1404
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:02,510
And then the other problem with Darren
till is that on the ground on his back,

1405
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:03,680
he didn't have anything,

1406
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:04,930
didn't have anything off.

1407
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,170
We didn't have anything to use.

1408
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:07,400
Raw shorts for sure.

1409
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,020
But if you can move,

1410
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:13,070
you've got to be or should do something
to protect yourself and something to

1411
00:35:13,071 --> 00:35:13,460
tie.

1412
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,110
He also didn't see the choke coming.

1413
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:17,000
That also could be because he was rocked.

1414
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,170
Look,

1415
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:20,510
if you look at the way
he dispatched cowboy,

1416
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,770
insanely impressive.

1417
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,840
If you look at the way he beat Wonderboy,

1418
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:25,360
also impressive in wonder boys,

1419
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:26,990
a world class striker don't friend.

1420
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:28,010
He feed them and dry them.

1421
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:28,471
Wonderful.

1422
00:35:28,471 --> 00:35:30,530
You spend one boys a hard code to crack.

1423
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,640
He's a hard code to crack.

1424
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,090
Yes.

1425
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:35,720
And especially if Wonderboy have some
time off to recover and sometime gone,

1426
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:38,040
gone through those two
big five round three,

1427
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:38,791
five round fights.

1428
00:35:38,791 --> 00:35:40,830
The fight did till fight was
a five round fight as well.

1429
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:42,570
So those are hard,

1430
00:35:42,571 --> 00:35:42,721
man.

1431
00:35:42,721 --> 00:35:43,710
They're hard on your body.

1432
00:35:43,711 --> 00:35:44,940
Hard going through training camp.

1433
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:49,090
And I want to say that I think Wonderboy
had a knee injury to that he's might've

1434
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:51,160
gotten surgery on and he's hasn't maybe,

1435
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:52,343
but yeah,

1436
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:56,340
that might might've made up the ne the
point is one of the welterweight division

1437
00:35:56,341 --> 00:35:57,300
is fun as fuck.

1438
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,220
Fucking every division's fun as fuck.

1439
00:35:59,221 --> 00:35:59,531
Bantam.

1440
00:35:59,531 --> 00:36:04,531
I just opened up with Pedro
Munoz heavyweights Kinda
crunk now to Johnny fucking

1441
00:36:04,561 --> 00:36:05,280
Walker.

1442
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:05,640
Yeah.

1443
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,290
Dude.

1444
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:07,123
Johnny Tor.

1445
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,250
Okay.

1446
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:09,840
Steven Juan Thompson said is moving,

1447
00:36:09,841 --> 00:36:11,430
was out the window after Derek Kill,

1448
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,090
uh,

1449
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:13,860
kicked a knee kick out.

1450
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:14,970
Okay.

1451
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:17,880
He's also saying that he doesn't think
that those kicks should be allowed,

1452
00:36:17,881 --> 00:36:22,881
which is crazy for someone to say that
kicks people on the head spinning wheel

1453
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,093
kits.

1454
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:24,631
Okay.

1455
00:36:24,631 --> 00:36:25,111
It says,

1456
00:36:25,111 --> 00:36:25,590
uh,

1457
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:25,860
uh,

1458
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,870
it was almost like the dude
was trying to put me out.

1459
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,250
Thompson told Ariel Helwani.

1460
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:29,750
Yeah,

1461
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:29,910
yeah.

1462
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:31,710
But he was definitely
trying to damn cage fight.

1463
00:36:31,711 --> 00:36:34,260
He hit me in the knee
and after that my movie,

1464
00:36:34,261 --> 00:36:37,410
it was pretty much out the window
is more focused on keeping my knee.

1465
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:39,690
It was just another thing
to think about out there.

1466
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:41,520
Well that's a strange attitude,

1467
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:42,710
you know what I mean?

1468
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:46,240
Maybe that comes because he came from
a karate background and not a Moitai

1469
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,093
background.

1470
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,270
All the tops on the show.

1471
00:36:48,271 --> 00:36:50,520
Thompson said he was unsure
of targeting the knee.

1472
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,890
Would that kick like that is legal?

1473
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:53,850
Well,

1474
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:55,350
I will tell you it's legal.

1475
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,670
It's definitely illegal.

1476
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,480
So it,

1477
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,530
so our heel hooks,

1478
00:36:58,531 --> 00:36:59,550
which are way worse,

1479
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,470
I mean do a spinning up.

1480
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,360
He says,

1481
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,500
hopefully it's nothing major,

1482
00:37:04,501 --> 00:37:05,041
but it sucks,

1483
00:37:05,041 --> 00:37:05,221
man.

1484
00:37:05,221 --> 00:37:05,761
It really does.

1485
00:37:05,761 --> 00:37:08,400
Disappointed by the whole situation than
coming out of it with an injury like

1486
00:37:08,401 --> 00:37:08,611
that.

1487
00:37:08,611 --> 00:37:09,720
It only makes it all worse.

1488
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:10,920
He has a fight coming up.

1489
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:11,760
Yeah.

1490
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,593
Pedis.

1491
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:13,770
Oh that's right.

1492
00:37:13,771 --> 00:37:16,890
So he must've healed it up
or got surgery or whatever.

1493
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:17,900
I just,

1494
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,350
I don't understand that.

1495
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,270
I don't understand that kind of thinking.

1496
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:22,680
I mean I don't,

1497
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,170
he said I was trying to hit
the guy hard or really was,

1498
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:27,660
I was just saying unable to put
myself in a situation to do so.

1499
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:32,700
And the reason for that is because he
kicked your knee and she is a technique.

1500
00:37:32,701 --> 00:37:32,881
Yeah.

1501
00:37:32,881 --> 00:37:33,950
It's a technique I'm using.

1502
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,820
It's a fucking legit technique.

1503
00:37:35,821 --> 00:37:36,420
It's going to occur.

1504
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,550
You said against Romero.

1505
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:38,190
Look I don't,

1506
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:38,700
yes,

1507
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,220
and Romero use it against
when we first got it,

1508
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,373
yeah,

1509
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:44,530
we're doing that and he
went right after the storm.

1510
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,390
You fucked my knee up and the
first friend I'm like fuck it.

1511
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:47,310
And the second fight,

1512
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:48,210
listen,

1513
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:48,750
it is,

1514
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:53,190
it is just as valid and maybe safer
than kicking someone in the head.

1515
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:56,610
It's easier to do for sure than
kicking someone in the head.

1516
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:56,941
But,

1517
00:37:56,941 --> 00:38:00,360
so what if you can kick someone in
the fucking head with a wheel kick?

1518
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:03,150
That is the worst thing you could do
to a person when a boy has no point.

1519
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:04,163
He's just point.

1520
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,400
It was just sad about the fight.

1521
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:05,940
Yeah,

1522
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:06,660
it just,

1523
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,291
it's unfortunate.

1524
00:38:07,291 --> 00:38:07,711
But again,

1525
00:38:07,711 --> 00:38:12,000
I think a lot of that is because he came
from that karate background and he came

1526
00:38:12,001 --> 00:38:15,780
from a above the waist style
karate background initially.

1527
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:19,710
You know when Duke Rufus was
cornering his brother Rick Rufus,

1528
00:38:19,711 --> 00:38:21,180
when Rick roof has fought a,

1529
00:38:21,181 --> 00:38:23,070
I forget the gentleman's
name from Thailand.

1530
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:24,383
Um,

1531
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:29,520
I think Lauren's Kenshin has it as
the most important kickboxing match in

1532
00:38:29,521 --> 00:38:29,971
history.

1533
00:38:29,971 --> 00:38:30,420
God Damn,

1534
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:34,590
I forget who that because we realized
how critical cause this was in Rick.

1535
00:38:34,591 --> 00:38:35,860
Rufus was his prime.

1536
00:38:35,861 --> 00:38:36,370
He was the man.

1537
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:37,150
He was the man.

1538
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:37,960
I mean Rick roof,

1539
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,501
the jet,

1540
00:38:38,501 --> 00:38:39,670
he would do wild shit.

1541
00:38:39,671 --> 00:38:40,090
Man.

1542
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:42,760
Jumped three 60 tourney
side kicks to the face.

1543
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,870
He would hit guys and knock them out
with a hook kicks and front leg Brown.

1544
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:46,570
Here he goes,

1545
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:47,290
Chang,

1546
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:48,123
try this name.

1547
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:51,550
Chang Pooh cat cat song.

1548
00:38:51,551 --> 00:38:52,384
Grit.

1549
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,351
I fucked that up.

1550
00:38:53,351 --> 00:38:56,620
I'm sure he would've said at Duke
would have said the name perfect.

1551
00:38:56,621 --> 00:38:58,450
But at the point is at
the end of the fight,

1552
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:02,110
after the Thai gentleman destroyed Rufus,

1553
00:39:02,111 --> 00:39:03,310
his legs and stopped him.

1554
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:09,210
Duke who's a world champion himself said
that he didn't think that it took any

1555
00:39:09,311 --> 00:39:14,020
skill to do that because that's how
a lot of those tie guys thought.

1556
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,640
He watched the end of this man,

1557
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:17,711
watch the end of this.

1558
00:39:17,711 --> 00:39:18,544
You can't walk.

1559
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,361
He could barely walk.

1560
00:39:19,361 --> 00:39:19,860
But Watch,

1561
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:22,030
they say go ahead and this
dude comes out and goes,

1562
00:39:22,031 --> 00:39:22,864
he knows what to do.

1563
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:29,520
They just get back to tax these legs and
this dude's a beast to the thighs and

1564
00:39:31,091 --> 00:39:32,080
this dude whack.

1565
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:33,730
He just fucking those legs up.

1566
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:35,950
Hands up high and just whack.

1567
00:39:35,951 --> 00:39:36,670
Look at this dude.

1568
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:37,930
Who's the Ralph?

1569
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,111
Well,

1570
00:39:38,111 --> 00:39:39,370
they didn't know any better up there.

1571
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:42,160
That's how they did it back
there with a karate kick.

1572
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:42,581
The Ref.

1573
00:39:42,581 --> 00:39:43,990
We're a fucking karate gie.

1574
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,030
The reps got a black belt.

1575
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:46,690
Yeah,

1576
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:49,360
he does look at that
whack plank in the ass.

1577
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:49,661
Yeah,

1578
00:39:49,661 --> 00:39:50,020
those,

1579
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,460
those leg kicks and that was it.

1580
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:55,390
So after it was over at Duke who I
think was only like 19 at the time,

1581
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:57,400
said he didn't think that took any skill.

1582
00:39:57,490 --> 00:40:02,080
Obviously Duke doesn't think that now
he evolved and became a world champion

1583
00:40:02,081 --> 00:40:02,914
himself.

1584
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,110
It's just ignorance,

1585
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,560
but that sort of stuff.

1586
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:07,360
There he is right there
like a young baby face,

1587
00:40:07,361 --> 00:40:07,811
Duke roof.

1588
00:40:07,811 --> 00:40:09,100
We'll play it so he could hear him say it

1589
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,840
the way the cookie crumbled

1590
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:15,670
back it up a little so
I can hear him say that.

1591
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:17,561
I'm not sure.

1592
00:40:17,561 --> 00:40:21,280
I just know that he's in pain and the
leg kicks with only thing that stopped

1593
00:40:21,281 --> 00:40:21,760
him.

1594
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,830
Like I did not touch me
anywhere else in the body.

1595
00:40:23,831 --> 00:40:24,430
You know?

1596
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:27,490
I think you know that Rick
should've won the fight.

1597
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:30,070
He had the guy out there
are three major fowl,

1598
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,800
but the way the cookie crumbles tonight,

1599
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:37,070
he said later that he didn't think
that it took skill to do that,

1600
00:40:37,071 --> 00:40:38,800
but which is they just
didn't know any better.

1601
00:40:38,801 --> 00:40:39,041
I was like,

1602
00:40:39,041 --> 00:40:40,230
this is how I

1603
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,140
kicked so hard to,

1604
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,180
that style is so good.

1605
00:40:45,181 --> 00:40:47,220
The Thai style is so God damn good.

1606
00:40:47,221 --> 00:40:48,054
It's so good.

1607
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:49,040
There are hidden movements.

1608
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:49,770
Yeah.

1609
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:54,770
Well the Thai style with the
other techniques is the best.

1610
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,520
If you got that Thai style,

1611
00:40:56,521 --> 00:40:57,930
but you know how to throw sidekicks,

1612
00:40:57,931 --> 00:40:58,200
you know,

1613
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:58,920
throw everything else.

1614
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,630
Wonderboy.

1615
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:00,463
Yeah.

1616
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:01,403
Jon Jones,

1617
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:02,130
Jon Jones.

1618
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:03,050
Jon Jones was stolen.

1619
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,980
No fucking throwing everything.

1620
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,590
It's a very interesting watching him,

1621
00:41:07,591 --> 00:41:07,741
man.

1622
00:41:07,741 --> 00:41:11,670
He's doing a lot sidekicks now and
spinning back kicks turning side to slant

1623
00:41:11,671 --> 00:41:12,504
into the body.

1624
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,320
Yeah.

1625
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,670
He's throwing a lot of sidekicks.

1626
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:15,511
He sees her,

1627
00:41:15,511 --> 00:41:16,710
he throws a lot of everything man.

1628
00:41:16,711 --> 00:41:17,970
But he fucks you up.

1629
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,050
He's just,

1630
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:22,140
and he's so good at keeping
guys in the back foot.

1631
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:23,010
Just dismiss.

1632
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:23,880
Just taken away there.

1633
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:24,250
Arsenal.

1634
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:26,880
I want to say this though because this
is something that's coming up and it's

1635
00:41:26,881 --> 00:41:28,110
actually kind of pissing me off.

1636
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:28,470
What's that?

1637
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:29,251
There's somebody who just,

1638
00:41:29,251 --> 00:41:34,251
a bunch of people that have been saying
should Anthony have take have like laid

1639
00:41:35,921 --> 00:41:39,890
down after you took that
illegal knee and won the title.

1640
00:41:39,891 --> 00:41:40,580
Who set this?

1641
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,770
Ariel Helwani a bunch
of other people said it.

1642
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:46,790
I think Ariel was suggesting or asking
whether or not he should have some Beta

1643
00:41:46,791 --> 00:41:47,480
male shit.

1644
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:47,781
Well,

1645
00:41:47,781 --> 00:41:51,650
it's crazy because the guy should
be praised for he ate the knee.

1646
00:41:51,651 --> 00:41:52,520
He was okay.

1647
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,310
And then he wasn't even
thinking about quitting.

1648
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:56,773
Yeah.

1649
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,250
I didn't even go through my mind.

1650
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,830
Is that once your my mind
that someone might do that?

1651
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,460
Some people say Smith.

1652
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:03,770
No,

1653
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:05,150
it wasn't was even a thought.

1654
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:05,750
No,

1655
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:06,170
nope.

1656
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:06,650
Nope.

1657
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:08,750
It wasn't a thought I don't
agree with and I wasn't like,

1658
00:42:08,751 --> 00:42:08,930
oh,

1659
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:10,910
we should all give him praise for this.

1660
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:11,600
I was like,

1661
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:11,751
no,

1662
00:42:11,751 --> 00:42:12,410
why would he do that?

1663
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:12,860
Well that's,

1664
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:13,760
that's who he is.

1665
00:42:13,761 --> 00:42:15,980
But some people like,

1666
00:42:15,981 --> 00:42:16,910
let's be honest,

1667
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:21,050
and I think Chelsea would probably admit
to this if he took that illegal knee,

1668
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:22,130
he might say that's it.

1669
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:22,880
Can't go on.

1670
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,360
Sorry.

1671
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,193
Rematch.

1672
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:27,980
Well you get the wind chills besman yeah,

1673
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:28,641
I mean you get the,

1674
00:42:28,641 --> 00:42:30,200
when you get the title you get a rematch.

1675
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:30,931
I could be wrong.

1676
00:42:30,931 --> 00:42:31,790
Child might disagree.

1677
00:42:31,791 --> 00:42:32,301
Might say no,

1678
00:42:32,301 --> 00:42:33,560
I'm a competitor when I'm in there.

1679
00:42:33,561 --> 00:42:33,891
I wouldn't,

1680
00:42:33,891 --> 00:42:34,700
wouldn't think that way.

1681
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:34,871
Not,

1682
00:42:34,871 --> 00:42:36,220
it is not now his agent,

1683
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:39,660
but the bottom line is like
some people were actually,

1684
00:42:39,661 --> 00:42:43,910
she actually suggesting that that that
would be a good option that he was,

1685
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:48,770
the many people have suggested
I saw several peon and
that the fans went hard on

1686
00:42:48,771 --> 00:42:50,090
these people that suggested it.

1687
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:50,631
Like,

1688
00:42:50,631 --> 00:42:51,910
you're out of your fucking mind.

1689
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:53,660
You're out of your fucking mind class.

1690
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:55,760
That'd be such a bitch move.

1691
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:58,970
Unless he actually couldn't go on.

1692
00:42:58,990 --> 00:42:59,130
Yeah.

1693
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:00,200
But we all saw he could.

1694
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:01,311
He goes,

1695
00:43:01,311 --> 00:43:01,700
I'm fine.

1696
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:01,930
He goes,

1697
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:02,071
no,

1698
00:43:02,071 --> 00:43:02,221
no,

1699
00:43:02,221 --> 00:43:02,550
I'm fine.

1700
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:02,750
I'm fine.

1701
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:03,020
Yeah,

1702
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:03,561
exactly.

1703
00:43:03,561 --> 00:43:06,980
What the Smith Anthony
Smith stock went higher.

1704
00:43:06,981 --> 00:43:07,820
Now we go,

1705
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:08,690
Oh shit.

1706
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:08,781
No,

1707
00:43:08,781 --> 00:43:10,190
he's top five for sure.

1708
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:12,650
And he looked very good
in the first round,

1709
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:14,150
the first round and looked very good.

1710
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:14,340
John,

1711
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:15,110
his take down defense.

1712
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:15,500
Yes.

1713
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:16,100
Very good.

1714
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:16,730
Very good.

1715
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:18,050
John started figuring them out.

1716
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:23,080
And John John is so good at forcing
you to fight his fight and for and,

1717
00:43:23,381 --> 00:43:23,651
and,

1718
00:43:23,651 --> 00:43:24,800
and being first.

1719
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:26,210
He's so good at being first.

1720
00:43:26,211 --> 00:43:28,310
First with the kicks first
the punches first forward.

1721
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:28,941
You know,

1722
00:43:28,941 --> 00:43:29,870
he doesn't give you a chance.

1723
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,580
And that's the thing with Anthony Smith.

1724
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:35,150
Anthony Smith chance was to always be
first if cash Shanthi Smith's fights

1725
00:43:35,151 --> 00:43:35,690
prior.

1726
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:37,670
He was a bull dozer comes at you.

1727
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:38,420
John went,

1728
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:39,021
that's what you do.

1729
00:43:39,021 --> 00:43:39,291
Cool.

1730
00:43:39,291 --> 00:43:40,280
I'm put you on your back foot.

1731
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:41,503
You go first.

1732
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:42,140
Not In mine.

1733
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:42,973
None of my night.

1734
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:43,813
I'm going to go first.

1735
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:47,600
Anthony Smith was defensive
the entire time I can fight.

1736
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:49,820
He just took away all his tools.

1737
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:52,070
He also fought very
technically in the first,

1738
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:52,941
first round.

1739
00:43:52,941 --> 00:43:53,390
It was,

1740
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:56,380
he didn't just showing Adam Anthony.

1741
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:56,940
Oh yeah.

1742
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:57,890
For very technical.

1743
00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:00,230
John actually the first
Sean got a little wild.

1744
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,230
I felt like he almost felt
the pressure of being up,

1745
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:03,080
you know,

1746
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,400
minus 800 favorite,

1747
00:44:04,401 --> 00:44:05,100
really expensive.

1748
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,310
Never seen John thrilled those
wild punches in that first room.

1749
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:08,450
He was trying to get them out of there.

1750
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:08,990
They went,

1751
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:09,500
you know what?

1752
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,370
This isn't gonna be as easy.

1753
00:44:10,371 --> 00:44:13,220
I thought recalculated
and then dismantle them.

1754
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:14,001
Yeah.

1755
00:44:14,001 --> 00:44:16,070
I mean he's the best of all time by far,

1756
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:16,911
by far the best.

1757
00:44:16,911 --> 00:44:18,150
But who who,

1758
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:21,020
who in that division
can fuck with him now?

1759
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:21,660
I mean,

1760
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:22,010
um,

1761
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:22,480
exactly.

1762
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,313
Santos,

1763
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:24,411
which is,

1764
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:24,651
look,

1765
00:44:24,651 --> 00:44:27,470
Santos is a wildcard that mother
fucker can knock out anybody.

1766
00:44:27,471 --> 00:44:30,440
I would have liked to see Johnny
Walker not blow his shoulder out.

1767
00:44:30,441 --> 00:44:31,040
Celebrate.

1768
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:31,873
And he's fine though.

1769
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:32,760
What?

1770
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:33,181
Listen man,

1771
00:44:33,181 --> 00:44:34,020
he could move his arm.

1772
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:35,840
He came in the back and they didn't even,

1773
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:37,410
they're waiting to I think today,

1774
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:38,850
but in the back after he went.

1775
00:44:38,851 --> 00:44:39,780
I'm actually good now.

1776
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:40,351
Okay,

1777
00:44:40,351 --> 00:44:42,000
so what that must mean.

1778
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:45,720
That must mean that he dislocated it
and then they popped it back in place.

1779
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:50,520
So it could be fine or there could be
some significant tearing inside that

1780
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:53,070
allowed it to dislocate and that
could be a problem in the future.

1781
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:53,220
Okay.

1782
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:54,040
It's fine though.

1783
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,170
Let's hope it's still not fine.

1784
00:44:55,171 --> 00:44:55,711
John Jones,

1785
00:44:55,711 --> 00:44:56,544
yet he hasn't wasted.

1786
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:57,630
Fill that dude up.

1787
00:44:57,650 --> 00:45:02,280
It's stem cells is get a bunch of needles
in there and fucking corazon do all

1788
00:45:02,281 --> 00:45:02,961
the fucking no,

1789
00:45:02,961 --> 00:45:03,850
no more bro.

1790
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:04,881
Don't know.

1791
00:45:04,881 --> 00:45:06,890
Give Him cortisones to
give them some stem cells.

1792
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,630
The interesting fight for John.

1793
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:10,260
Yes,

1794
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:15,210
he's interesting because Santos throws
fucking nuclear muscles at your head and

1795
00:45:15,211 --> 00:45:16,910
you know he did stop Jimmy and Mattawa.

1796
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:17,221
He's,

1797
00:45:17,221 --> 00:45:19,050
he stopped several guys
that light heavyweight.

1798
00:45:19,051 --> 00:45:20,220
He looks spectacular,

1799
00:45:20,221 --> 00:45:22,650
light every way and he stopped
Anthony Smith and their last fight at

1800
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:23,100
middleweight.

1801
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:27,480
I would imagine Santos is almost a
bigger underdog then Anthony Smith.

1802
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:28,470
Um,

1803
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:29,820
I would imagine that too,

1804
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:33,150
but I would imagine that he's not
going to fight like Anthony Smith.

1805
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:33,691
Is he okay?

1806
00:45:33,691 --> 00:45:35,320
Was it say I'm fine.

1807
00:45:35,321 --> 00:45:36,300
My shoulder's not too bad.

1808
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:38,490
Not too bad is not a good thing to say.

1809
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:43,850
I just need to do some exams and check
to be 100% sure that it was nothing

1810
00:45:43,921 --> 00:45:44,400
serious.

1811
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:44,581
Okay.

1812
00:45:44,581 --> 00:45:45,630
That doesn't mean it's okay.

1813
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,940
Because the thing about shoulder tariffs,

1814
00:45:47,941 --> 00:45:50,910
and this is coming from someone
who's had some shoulder issues,

1815
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:51,691
they,

1816
00:45:51,691 --> 00:45:54,990
it feels all right until you do something
weird and then it hurts and then

1817
00:45:54,991 --> 00:45:55,231
you're like,

1818
00:45:55,231 --> 00:45:55,590
fuck.

1819
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:57,930
And then you get an Mri and then
they look at it and they go,

1820
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:58,950
you got some tears in there.

1821
00:45:58,951 --> 00:46:00,120
So sometimes he thought,

1822
00:46:00,121 --> 00:46:00,660
shit,

1823
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:01,211
I've had pro.

1824
00:46:01,211 --> 00:46:01,501
I'm like,

1825
00:46:01,501 --> 00:46:01,741
dude,

1826
00:46:01,741 --> 00:46:02,400
I'm fucked.

1827
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,420
I can't move my shoulder.

1828
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:04,440
Then two days later like,

1829
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:04,780
Whoa,

1830
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:05,180
right,

1831
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:05,580
let's do,

1832
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:08,380
that's usually like sore
tendons or sore muscles.

1833
00:46:08,381 --> 00:46:09,360
Which doing the worm.

1834
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:09,481
Yeah,

1835
00:46:09,481 --> 00:46:12,330
but he fell face first and
landed on his shoulder.

1836
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:12,661
Weird.

1837
00:46:12,661 --> 00:46:13,920
I'm sure he's done doing that.

1838
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,210
Maybe man,

1839
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:15,810
I don't know.

1840
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:17,370
It's hard as post fight speech.

1841
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:19,530
Got His Mickey mouse.

1842
00:46:19,531 --> 00:46:19,681
Yeah,

1843
00:46:19,681 --> 00:46:20,514
he's hilarious.

1844
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:22,020
He's a real character.

1845
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,940
He's a character when
you work on his English.

1846
00:46:23,941 --> 00:46:24,930
But he's didn't go far.

1847
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:27,930
Motherfucker has some POW or flying me.

1848
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:30,260
I was grilling for everyone and I'm,

1849
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:34,680
I've lost track of time when we did
the TV from my backyard and I saw them,

1850
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:35,520
I saw him go,

1851
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,330
let's get it on.

1852
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:38,810
I just fucking dropped
everything and sprinted.

1853
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:39,130
Cut Out.

1854
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:41,530
Motherfucker knocks do das seconds.

1855
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:41,830
Yeah.

1856
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:43,860
Well this is his third
fight in the octagon,

1857
00:46:43,861 --> 00:46:45,210
but he's fighting Nisha sir.

1858
00:46:45,211 --> 00:46:46,950
Chernoff who's a a real,

1859
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:48,300
he said that he's half man.

1860
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:52,050
He's a tank and he's got some serious
grappling skill is chokes the shit out of

1861
00:46:52,051 --> 00:46:52,830
everybody.

1862
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:56,100
Choked out Pat Cummings in his last fight
and he chokes the fuck out of people.

1863
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:57,570
But you know,

1864
00:46:57,930 --> 00:46:58,591
Johnny Walker,

1865
00:46:58,591 --> 00:46:59,640
let's watch it real quick.

1866
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,390
I mean fucking the,

1867
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:05,280
but the thing about walkers is so loose.

1868
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:08,690
He came into that fight dancing Paolo,

1869
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:09,533
boom,

1870
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:09,970
look at it.

1871
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:10,803
Here's the thing.

1872
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:13,650
What's he like when someone takes
you down and when the third,

1873
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:15,930
we've got to find out he's a
brown belt in Jujitsu though.

1874
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:16,650
Yeah.

1875
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:17,430
Watch this.

1876
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:18,263
See,

1877
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,780
he slapped his own arm on the ground.

1878
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:22,200
Like,

1879
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,033
let me see that again.

1880
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:24,710
Just jump on this.

1881
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:25,441
His left arm.

1882
00:47:25,441 --> 00:47:26,700
It's his left arm that hurt.

1883
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:27,571
So watch this.

1884
00:47:27,571 --> 00:47:28,404
He goes down.

1885
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:29,650
Yeah.

1886
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:30,070
Esther

1887
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:34,050
[inaudible] has a great photo of a,

1888
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:35,231
God damn,

1889
00:47:35,231 --> 00:47:35,951
he's lying there.

1890
00:47:35,951 --> 00:47:36,280
He was like,

1891
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:36,580
ah,

1892
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:36,971
fuck.

1893
00:47:36,971 --> 00:47:37,780
I hurt my arm.

1894
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:38,613
He's going to be fine.

1895
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:39,010
Look,

1896
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:40,180
he might not be fine,

1897
00:47:40,181 --> 00:47:40,520
dude.

1898
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:40,720
Dude,

1899
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:41,650
let's wish with the best.

1900
00:47:41,651 --> 00:47:42,820
I'm wishing for the best.

1901
00:47:42,821 --> 00:47:43,121
Listen,

1902
00:47:43,121 --> 00:47:43,990
I'm a fan of the guy.

1903
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:46,180
I'm wishing for the best Santos,

1904
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:47,163
but this,

1905
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:51,010
there are so many videos of football
players celebrating touchdowns and blowing

1906
00:47:51,011 --> 00:47:51,880
their ACL out.

1907
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:52,900
Yeah.

1908
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:53,590
It's,

1909
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:53,951
he's like,

1910
00:47:53,951 --> 00:47:54,230
hey,

1911
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:55,063
get a doctor.

1912
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:58,690
So he got up and you know
what's interesting is I
was talking to one of his,

1913
00:47:58,691 --> 00:47:59,110
uh,

1914
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:00,520
his teammates and they were like,

1915
00:48:00,521 --> 00:48:00,760
you know,

1916
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:01,960
you see how Lucy is,

1917
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:02,411
he's like,

1918
00:48:02,411 --> 00:48:03,490
he's loose for everything.

1919
00:48:03,491 --> 00:48:04,810
That's just how he is with life

1920
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:07,210
dancing.

1921
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:08,043
He was stripping?

1922
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:09,123
No,

1923
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:11,890
he was a dancer I think in Brazil.

1924
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:14,200
Under Brazil style.

1925
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:15,820
Dude.

1926
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:16,653
He's,

1927
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:19,630
and he's a good ship or do this
boy probably made some mud.

1928
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:23,591
Well,

1929
00:48:23,591 --> 00:48:24,131
he's a,

1930
00:48:24,131 --> 00:48:27,070
he's a real interesting addition
to that division and division.

1931
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,270
Finally got some life back.

1932
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:29,730
Santo's him.

1933
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:30,603
Who's the other dude?

1934
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:31,713
Um,

1935
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,040
God stud,

1936
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,090
which Ah,

1937
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:35,080
it's ranked like number 10.

1938
00:48:35,081 --> 00:48:35,914
I think

1939
00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:39,300
the way light heavyweights killing it.

1940
00:48:39,301 --> 00:48:39,690
Yeah,

1941
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:40,620
I know who you're talking about.

1942
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:42,330
I can't do it either.

1943
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:43,163
Ethnic in,

1944
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:43,950
yeah.

1945
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:44,783
Fuck.

1946
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:45,151
Let me see.

1947
00:48:45,151 --> 00:48:45,984
The division.

1948
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:47,280
He's top 15,

1949
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:48,563
top 10.

1950
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:49,583
Let me see.

1951
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:52,400
Let me tell a little bigger
at do is Dominic graves?

1952
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:53,070
Yeah.

1953
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:54,420
Dominic Reyes is a monster.

1954
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:55,221
He's,

1955
00:48:55,221 --> 00:48:57,000
he's super athletic too.

1956
00:48:57,030 --> 00:48:59,760
The thing about Dominick
Reyes is super smart,

1957
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:01,110
super athletic,

1958
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,190
and he's nine and,

1959
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:02,521
oh,

1960
00:49:02,521 --> 00:49:04,650
undefeated him in verse,

1961
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:05,430
uh,

1962
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:06,680
Johnny Walker be hell of like,

1963
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:07,260
Ooh.

1964
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:07,510
Yeah.

1965
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:08,343
So many good match.

1966
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:12,600
I'll light heavyweight with the young
guys raises a really good athlete.

1967
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:14,690
The thing about him at separates
him from everybody else.

1968
00:49:14,691 --> 00:49:15,720
It's like he has a background.

1969
00:49:15,721 --> 00:49:17,010
What do you have a background in football?

1970
00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:17,903
Was that what he was,

1971
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:19,440
was so popular?

1972
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:20,221
What was his,

1973
00:49:20,221 --> 00:49:20,520
uh,

1974
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:23,220
I'd say Johnny Walkers probably
more athletic than these guys.

1975
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:26,770
He's so big and the way he
moves so big and it weird.

1976
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:27,401
He's from Brazil.

1977
00:49:27,401 --> 00:49:30,080
His name's Johnny Walker
is named after whiskey.

1978
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:31,230
Go find a weird,

1979
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:31,621
yeah.

1980
00:49:31,621 --> 00:49:33,660
Who knows those Johnny Walker whiskey.

1981
00:49:33,661 --> 00:49:37,530
Not just do a deal now I now write
jump on board before this Cha gentlemen

1982
00:49:37,531 --> 00:49:38,364
becomes a champ.

1983
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:38,790
Yeah.

1984
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:40,770
Have him wear a Johnnie
Walker tee shirt and ship.

1985
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:41,580
Now again,

1986
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:43,470
light heavyweight will be so much better.

1987
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,330
The same thing that
happened in welterweight.

1988
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:46,590
If Jon Jones goes,

1989
00:49:46,591 --> 00:49:48,300
how fun boys and goes the heavyweight,

1990
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:48,900
right,

1991
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:49,910
which no one's been on.

1992
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,450
These guys are beating John very well.

1993
00:49:51,451 --> 00:49:52,110
Could happen.

1994
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:53,010
Nothing's guys are beating.

1995
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:53,311
Well,

1996
00:49:53,311 --> 00:49:56,640
John Might Fight Tiago next
and if he fights Tiago,

1997
00:49:56,641 --> 00:49:57,450
I mean look,

1998
00:49:57,450 --> 00:49:59,130

Yeah.

2011
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,313
Easily.

2012
00:50:15,330 --> 00:50:15,920
Okay.

00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,300
I do technical support for,

2014
00:50:18,301 --> 00:50:18,691
okay.

2015
00:50:18,691 --> 00:50:21,320
He works at an it
technical support and NFL.

2016
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:22,140
See,

2017
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:22,680
hold on.

2018
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:25,710
Paul Dreamt of playing in the NFL,

2019
00:50:25,711 --> 00:50:26,970
but didn't he play for high school?

2020
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:31,090
He played in high school and college
and not being drafted here for the sea

2021
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:31,491
wolves.

2022
00:50:31,491 --> 00:50:31,850
I don't know.

2023
00:50:31,850 --> 00:50:32,360
Okay.

2024
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:32,870
So yeah,

2025
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:33,740
so he played football.

2026
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:34,190
Oh,

2027
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:35,270
at Stony Brook.

2028
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:36,230
Okay,

2029
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:39,170
so he played football and then decided to,

2030
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:39,600
yeah.

2031
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:40,433
Well

2032
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:45,500
still excellent athlete all because
the points didn't get drafted.

2033
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:46,791
But for football,

2034
00:50:46,791 --> 00:50:48,340
smarter Shantay standards,

2035
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:50,450
he's super happy and smart as shit.

2036
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:51,441
Yeah.

2037
00:50:51,441 --> 00:50:51,651
You know,

2038
00:50:51,651 --> 00:50:52,131
that's the thing.

2039
00:50:52,131 --> 00:50:53,090
We've talked about this before.

2040
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:54,950
The difference between
the level of athletes,

2041
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:57,440
between the guys that are
going into the NFL and the MBA,

2042
00:50:57,470 --> 00:50:58,191
that they're there,

2043
00:50:58,191 --> 00:50:59,270
that the height of the height,

2044
00:50:59,330 --> 00:50:59,571
dude,

2045
00:50:59,571 --> 00:51:01,010
why watch the NFL combine?

2046
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,810
There's a guy who was six,

2047
00:51:02,811 --> 00:51:03,380
three,

2048
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:04,610
230 pounds,

2049
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:07,100
ran a four three and the
40 or the 40 introvert.

2050
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:08,240
He's a wide receiver.

2051
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:12,200
That isn't the best footwork you've ever
seen has footwork like Dominick Cruz.

2052
00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:12,600
It's,

2053
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:13,580
it's mind blowing.

2054
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:18,110
There's a defensive lineman ran
a four four 40 a big fat dude.

2055
00:51:18,111 --> 00:51:19,160
That's insane.

2056
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:20,630
That's so fast.

2057
00:51:20,631 --> 00:51:23,450
Who 300 pounders ran plus sub five second,

2058
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,830
300 pounds.

2059
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:26,730
Sub Five second for her.

2060
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,070
That's insane.

2061
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:29,570
That's insane to,

2062
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:31,430
that's so fast.

2063
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:32,060
Have you,

2064
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:33,400
I don't know why I bring
this one in paypal.

2065
00:51:33,401 --> 00:51:34,100
I again,

2066
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:36,980
have you ever seen the guy because
we're on the 40th day comes out.

2067
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:41,130
It's the best moment in sports.

2068
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:43,140
He's got so much dick.

2069
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:45,450
It can't be held in any false.

2070
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:46,051
No,

2071
00:51:46,051 --> 00:51:47,010
and he bobs up and goes,

2072
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:47,270
oh.

2073
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:47,560
She goes,

2074
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:48,200
what happened?

2075
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,021
My Dick fell out,

2076
00:51:49,021 --> 00:51:49,800
man,

2077
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,290
and they pause and he's this fat black.

2078
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:54,540
Let's see him go,

2079
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:55,873
ready,

2080
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,940
go Duh,

2081
00:51:58,030 --> 00:51:58,440
Duh,

2082
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:59,030
Duh,

2083
00:51:59,030 --> 00:51:59,860
Duh,

2084
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:00,930
Duh Duh.

2085
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:04,351
Oh my God.

2086
00:52:04,351 --> 00:52:05,250
He fell on his dick.

2087
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:05,801
That's his car.

2088
00:52:05,801 --> 00:52:06,780
He tucks it in.

2089
00:52:07,270 --> 00:52:08,103
No replay.

2090
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,021
They slow it down.

2091
00:52:09,021 --> 00:52:11,820
You see this big data fell out,

2092
00:52:11,821 --> 00:52:12,654
man.

2093
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:13,740
That is so fun.

2094
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:15,090
Look at the size of that guy.

2095
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:15,933
When they redo it,

2096
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:18,040
let me see.

2097
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:22,010
It helps to like dammit,

2098
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:25,410
you decided to fall down
to cover his own dick.

2099
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,680
It's crazy that he's so
confident that his dick is tough.

2100
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:29,430
Look at that.

2101
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:30,263
He went,

2102
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:31,881
let's see.

2103
00:52:31,881 --> 00:52:32,510
Break it down.

2104
00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:33,343
Oh Jesus.

2105
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:34,193
There it is.

2106
00:52:34,290 --> 00:52:34,981
Pops out.

2107
00:52:34,981 --> 00:52:35,940
It's like God damn it,

2108
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:37,410
Dick fell out again.

2109
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:38,910
Imagine that kind of a problem.

2110
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:43,370
Imagine she's writing is why.

2111
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:44,213
It's great.

2112
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:48,640
Amazing how many women you
started blowing up his dms like,

2113
00:52:49,830 --> 00:52:52,050
I mean when your Dick Falls
out while you're running,

2114
00:52:52,051 --> 00:52:53,060
you can't even contain

2115
00:52:55,290 --> 00:52:56,530
biggest moment of his height.

2116
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:02,770
He's been waiting to dreaming
of going down the hill.

2117
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:04,840
It's like into the game
and other Ronnie Spa.

2118
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:06,280
I'm sure it's give them a

2119
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:10,600
sturdy pair of compression shorts.

2120
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:12,183
Every dude does.

2121
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:13,053
I get up man.

2122
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:14,200
Let's go again.

2123
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:17,200
This is something I'm not understanding
about dudes who are not wearing

2124
00:53:17,201 --> 00:53:19,000
compression shorts with
a cup like a diamond.

2125
00:53:19,001 --> 00:53:20,800
Emma makeup in the NFL.

2126
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:21,101
No,

2127
00:53:21,101 --> 00:53:25,500
an MMA like guys who get nut shouted
like that when guys Dev reg a regular cup

2128
00:53:25,501 --> 00:53:26,700
on like how,

2129
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:28,720
how do you have a regular cup on in,

2130
00:53:28,721 --> 00:53:33,630
in 2019 how do you have that when you can
have one of those compression cups and

2131
00:53:33,631 --> 00:53:34,500
you're not going to get hurt.

2132
00:53:34,501 --> 00:53:36,380
Sometimes those cups are
uncomfortable and it's,

2133
00:53:36,490 --> 00:53:36,790
yeah,

2134
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:37,380
they are.

2135
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:37,831
Fuck yeah,

2136
00:53:37,831 --> 00:53:38,131
they are.

2137
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:39,240
You know what's more uncomfortable?

2138
00:53:39,241 --> 00:53:40,590
Can kink kicked in the nuts?

2139
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:41,603
I don't get it.

2140
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:42,331
Kenny Florian,

2141
00:53:42,331 --> 00:53:43,590
he used to wear the tie steel cup.

2142
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:44,400
And here's the thing,

2143
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,130
I don't think the ties
steel cup should be legal,

2144
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:49,200
but is it is legal or,

2145
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:49,921
oh yeah,

2146
00:53:49,921 --> 00:53:51,390
it's a nasty fulcrum.

2147
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:52,500
But not only that,

2148
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:53,860
but even if you're,

2149
00:53:53,870 --> 00:53:54,240
um,

2150
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:55,560
you accidentally hit it,

2151
00:53:56,310 --> 00:53:57,750
you're hitting a piece of metal.

2152
00:53:57,870 --> 00:53:59,760
Like why is it okay to
have a piece of metal?

2153
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:04,770
You could break your foot and a guy can
do something to you and slam that metal

2154
00:54:04,771 --> 00:54:05,610
into your face.

2155
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:06,301
I mean,

2156
00:54:06,301 --> 00:54:08,700
some weird shit can happen
and you can break a bone.

2157
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:09,271
I mean,

2158
00:54:09,271 --> 00:54:09,511
there's,

2159
00:54:09,511 --> 00:54:12,510
there's many opportunities
where guys like,

2160
00:54:12,511 --> 00:54:13,260
how about this?

2161
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:16,470
A guy shoots in and the
guy hits him with his hips.

2162
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:17,040
Right?

2163
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:20,730
You could hit him with your hips and
catch that Steel Cup right in your fucking

2164
00:54:20,731 --> 00:54:21,940
mouth and break your face.

2165
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:24,510
Remember metrio knocked out
Derrick Lewis with his hips.

2166
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:25,430
Remember that?

2167
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:26,780
I thought he hit him in the
right hook or something.

2168
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:29,700
He felt like he just sprawled
and knocked them out.

2169
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:30,743
Really?

2170
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:31,501
Wow.

2171
00:54:31,501 --> 00:54:32,250
I don't remember that.

2172
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:33,960
I don't know why did I remember Iste?

2173
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:36,210
And like 13 seconds he hit him with that,

2174
00:54:36,211 --> 00:54:37,500
but then he hit him with some punches too.

2175
00:54:37,501 --> 00:54:38,370
Right at the end,

2176
00:54:38,371 --> 00:54:39,330
but still the hips.

2177
00:54:39,331 --> 00:54:40,070
What fucked up.

2178
00:54:40,070 --> 00:54:41,640
Just those interesting.

2179
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:42,420
Crazy.

2180
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:43,050
Yeah.

2181
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:44,970
I W I really think that those cups,

2182
00:54:44,971 --> 00:54:47,460
like a diamond MMA style
cup should be standard.

2183
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,560
And I think diamond MMA
probably has the best one.

2184
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:53,190
I didn't like him when I was fighting
just because they're so uncomfortable.

2185
00:54:53,370 --> 00:54:54,510
I'd rather you hit me in the day.

2186
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:56,430
I don't think the diamond
ones are that uncomfortable.

2187
00:54:58,290 --> 00:54:59,220
Um,

2188
00:54:59,250 --> 00:54:59,671
I forgot.

2189
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:00,504
I bet it's not.

2190
00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:01,523
We have one here.

2191
00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:02,190
We'll give it to you.

2192
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:02,821
You want to try it out,

2193
00:55:02,821 --> 00:55:03,870
but you don't give a fuck anymore.

2194
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,260
I don't know what I'd use it for you.

2195
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:07,680
And they're fucking looked on stage good.

2196
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,130
Like Gene Simmons and kiss.

2197
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:13,080
He's got one with teeth
on it or something.

2198
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:16,770
Those steel cups though.

2199
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:18,860
Some he used to wear those in Jujitsu.

2200
00:55:18,910 --> 00:55:21,210
It was horrible cause
they'd get on top of you.

2201
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,220
They look if somebody,

2202
00:55:22,221 --> 00:55:24,300
what else did you and the grape vine,

2203
00:55:24,301 --> 00:55:25,200
your legs and Doug,

2204
00:55:25,201 --> 00:55:25,831
that fucking thing.

2205
00:55:25,831 --> 00:55:26,810
And your chest dude.

2206
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:30,240
How about fucking Huseman
fucking grape vining Woodley.

2207
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:31,620
Yup.

2208
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:32,400
Mounted them.

2209
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,090
Yup.

2210
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:33,530
And then,

2211
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:34,230
and then,

2212
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:35,063
um,

2213
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:36,840
I had my boy Todd
Feldman over at my house.

2214
00:55:36,841 --> 00:55:37,380
He goes,

2215
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:39,180
could there be anything worse or he goes,

2216
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,980
that looks like a bad position to be in.

2217
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:41,731
And I turned around,

2218
00:55:41,731 --> 00:55:42,120
I went,

2219
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:42,953
excuse me sir.

2220
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:44,220
The worst,

2221
00:55:44,430 --> 00:55:48,360
there's nothing worse than professional
sports than in the UFC when he get

2222
00:55:48,361 --> 00:55:52,230
mounted on national TV in front of
millions of people and you just,

2223
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:56,580
it's the most kind of Beta
male move of all time.

2224
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:57,780
You're on your back.

2225
00:55:57,930 --> 00:55:58,980
You can't get up.

2226
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:01,650
This means on top of you chest.

2227
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:03,090
It's so embarrassing.

2228
00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:04,200
And he tells him the worse.

2229
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,940
He held him there for a long time.

2230
00:56:05,970 --> 00:56:07,710
All your buddies are watching on damn.

2231
00:56:07,850 --> 00:56:08,280
Oh.

2232
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,570
And you know the interesting,

2233
00:56:09,571 --> 00:56:11,910
it didn't seem like tire and
had the energy to get him off.

2234
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:13,590
Like he didn't even hip escape correctly.

2235
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:16,530
He knows how to hit the
Cape Town's Jujitsu.

2236
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:17,470
Something was up with Woodley.

2237
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:17,721
Yes.

2238
00:56:17,721 --> 00:56:19,440
So he looked off,

2239
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:24,320
well I don't know if that it was it or
he's just wilting under the pressure that

2240
00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:25,300
Osborne was putting on them.

2241
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:26,553
Here's why.

2242
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:28,240
And I'm not taking anything
away from Moosomin.

2243
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:31,900
I think one of the greatest title fight
performances of all time of all time.

2244
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:32,950
Maybe the best.

2245
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:34,360
That's fine.

2246
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:34,690
I'm fine.

2247
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:39,280
Every minute of every round against
tenets and against a guy who many people

2248
00:56:39,281 --> 00:56:43,330
thought w was in the running to be the
thought of as the greatest welterweight

2249
00:56:43,331 --> 00:56:43,870
of all time.

2250
00:56:43,870 --> 00:56:44,440
Top two.

2251
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:45,700
And if you won that fight,

2252
00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:47,200
especially stopped him.

2253
00:56:47,201 --> 00:56:48,720
I think you could put
them in that category.

2254
00:56:48,721 --> 00:56:49,240
I agree.

2255
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,190
So we both agree how impressive it is.

2256
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:51,780
Yeah.

2257
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:55,210
Well I thought he might be off
is right in the opening minute.

2258
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:58,270
Remember Huseman shoots
will grabbed a guillotine,

2259
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:00,610
falls on the wrong side against the cage.

2260
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,950
Well world champions don't do that.

2261
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:04,450
He's not there mentally.

2262
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:05,141
Also,

2263
00:57:05,141 --> 00:57:06,870
he kept holding onto that chemo.

2264
00:57:07,170 --> 00:57:07,511
I was like,

2265
00:57:07,511 --> 00:57:07,961
my God,

2266
00:57:07,961 --> 00:57:08,980
he's going to get von flute.

2267
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:10,150
And I think the only thing,

2268
00:57:10,450 --> 00:57:12,750
I think we're calling it the OSP now Lsp,

2269
00:57:13,070 --> 00:57:13,990
the Lsp,

2270
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:14,920
sorry von flue.

2271
00:57:15,190 --> 00:57:17,620
But OSP has more von
flue chokes in anybody.

2272
00:57:17,621 --> 00:57:20,350
You kind of have to call
it the Osp of in St period.

2273
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:21,213
But then,

2274
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:24,100
but when I saw that fluid
kind of invented it.

2275
00:57:24,101 --> 00:57:24,341
Right.

2276
00:57:24,341 --> 00:57:25,480
Did he invent that choke?

2277
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:26,770
I doubt he invented it.

2278
00:57:26,830 --> 00:57:29,590
I want to know if he invented it because
if he invented he got to give it to

2279
00:57:29,591 --> 00:57:29,711
them.

2280
00:57:29,711 --> 00:57:30,220
True.

2281
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:31,390
Let's call it the OSPI though.

2282
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:32,283
Way Cooler.

2283
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:33,720
So you went for those peach choke.

2284
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:34,150
Yes.

2285
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:35,290
So he goes for that choke,

2286
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:37,750
but at Woodley's level to do
that and opening rounds in it.

2287
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:38,680
Well he's not ready yet.

2288
00:57:38,790 --> 00:57:39,020
He,

2289
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:41,500
he's mentally not firing
right now cause that's,

2290
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,740
that's really been a
black belt in Jujitsu.

2291
00:57:43,870 --> 00:57:44,080
Yeah.

2292
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,520
It was the greatest fighters of all time.

2293
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:48,460
Like you ever seen George
Saint Pierre makeup mental,

2294
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:49,900
not like that.

2295
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:50,733
Never.

2296
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:51,220
Never.

2297
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:52,053
Not in a world title.

2298
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:53,020
Never.

2299
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:53,800
So I saw that one.

2300
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:54,730
Oh Woodley's off.

2301
00:57:55,090 --> 00:57:59,670
You might be right about him having one
foot out the door because being through,

2302
00:57:59,690 --> 00:58:03,160
do we figure out if he's 36
or 37 it's 37 in a month.

2303
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:08,640
So basically 37 basically 37
doing all that stuff for TMZ.

2304
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:12,850
I want to say he opened
for Wiz Khalifa recently.

2305
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:14,560
If they have an album together.

2306
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:16,330
Oh Shit Wiz it gonna come on the show.

2307
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,240
We're working it out right now.

2308
00:58:17,241 --> 00:58:18,670
If you're in need to get so high,

2309
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:19,961
this can be awesome.

2310
00:58:19,961 --> 00:58:20,660
That'll be fun.

2311
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:21,350
I want to come in.

2312
00:58:21,350 --> 00:58:21,650
Sure.

2313
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:25,990
And how was I sound that
was on fucking Pluto.

2314
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:27,850
Let's fight companions.

2315
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:28,900
Pass these,

2316
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:30,430
these fucking backwoods ones,

2317
00:58:30,431 --> 00:58:32,410
man to Caesar a problem.

2318
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:33,670
I was so high.

2319
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:35,200
I was Jones had one,

2320
00:58:35,201 --> 00:58:36,430
but it was only tobacco folks.

2321
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:37,983
Um,

2322
00:58:38,410 --> 00:58:38,621
yeah,

2323
00:58:38,621 --> 00:58:38,950
but,

2324
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:40,210
but both with Woodley,

2325
00:58:40,211 --> 00:58:41,410
when we say one foot in,

2326
00:58:41,411 --> 00:58:41,920
one foot out,

2327
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,380
it's easy to say because in hindsight,

2328
00:58:44,381 --> 00:58:45,820
cause eventually he was going to lose.

2329
00:58:45,970 --> 00:58:46,320
Yeah.

2330
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,040
But before this he was
doing all that stuff,

2331
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:48,320
right.

2332
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:48,991
He beat tail.

2333
00:58:48,991 --> 00:58:51,250
He was doing this stuff and
they beat Wonderboy twice.

2334
00:58:51,251 --> 00:58:52,210
He was doing this stuff.

2335
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:53,973
So I don't know,

2336
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:56,110
it's just a bad matchup.

2337
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:58,740
But we were looking at these
points he had off night.

2338
00:58:58,760 --> 00:58:59,080
Yeah,

2339
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,460
he does too much stuff outside dot.

2340
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,600
Gun or loose ones.

2341
00:59:01,601 --> 00:59:02,710
Just a bad mother.

2342
00:59:02,711 --> 00:59:02,980
Fuck.

2343
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:04,120
I think it's all the above.

2344
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,390
But lose man is absolutely
a bad motherfucker.

2345
00:59:06,430 --> 00:59:06,791
And who knows?

2346
00:59:06,791 --> 00:59:09,670
He might have been able to do that
anyway even if Tyron was in perfect

2347
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:10,300
condition.

2348
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:11,920
But here's the question.

2349
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:16,660
Tyrin over the last few fights over the
last few years has been able to control

2350
00:59:16,661 --> 00:59:17,620
the pace of the fight.

2351
00:59:18,070 --> 00:59:20,800
A 100% he controlled the
pace of the Maya fight.

2352
00:59:20,801 --> 00:59:21,634
He the pace,

2353
00:59:21,770 --> 00:59:22,190
obviously

2354
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:23,750
Darren till fight was a good,

2355
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:25,220
easy victory for him.

2356
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,280
Relatively controlled.

2357
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:28,550
The pace of the Wonderboy fight,

2358
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:33,610
fought smart and then hit him when he
wanted to with big shots and he was the

2359
00:59:33,891 --> 00:59:34,880
one who had Wonderboy boy hurt.

2360
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:35,330
Right?

2361
00:59:35,330 --> 00:59:37,070
But boy it was never pressing him,

2362
00:59:37,071 --> 00:59:37,904
like making it,

2363
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:39,200
forcing his cardio.

2364
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:40,900
But if you go back and watch them,

2365
00:59:40,970 --> 00:59:43,430
some of the fights where he had
problems earlier in his career,

2366
00:59:43,790 --> 00:59:44,870
like Nate Marquardt,

2367
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:46,190
like Rory Macdonald,

2368
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:47,570
it's someone pushing him,

2369
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:50,330
someone pushing him and this,

2370
00:59:50,450 --> 00:59:50,930
you know,

2371
00:59:50,930 --> 00:59:51,763
this might,

2372
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:56,450
he might have figured out a way to
look when you're that muscular and he's

2373
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:58,280
fucking ridiculously muscular.

2374
00:59:58,490 --> 01:00:01,310
I mean Tyron has legs the
size of a running backs,

2375
01:00:01,311 --> 01:00:03,640
his giant athletic and
muscular as fuck too.

2376
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:04,221
He is,

2377
01:00:04,221 --> 01:00:05,420
but who spins longer,

2378
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:06,351
longer,

2379
01:00:06,351 --> 01:00:07,730
it's different like it's not,

2380
01:00:07,731 --> 01:00:10,280
it's not that stacked as Jack Dense,

2381
01:00:10,490 --> 01:00:12,170
almost power lifting muscle.

2382
01:00:12,410 --> 01:00:16,700
And that muscle is one of the reasons why
Tyron is so fucking fast and powerful,

2383
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:17,751
but it also,

2384
01:00:17,751 --> 01:00:21,500
you could make the argument that that
muscle just comes with an unavoidable

2385
01:00:21,501 --> 01:00:25,700
price and that what he's been really
able to do is jack his conditioning up as

2386
01:00:25,701 --> 01:00:30,050
high as possible and then also do a
really good job of controlling the pace of

2387
01:00:30,051 --> 01:00:30,590
fight.

2388
01:00:30,590 --> 01:00:31,770
He couldn't do that with Huseman.

2389
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:32,953
Good point.

2390
01:00:32,990 --> 01:00:33,823
Could be,

2391
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:35,073
so we don't know.

2392
01:00:35,510 --> 01:00:36,860
I feel bad for the guy.

2393
01:00:36,890 --> 01:00:37,723
I'm a fan.

2394
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:40,970
I want to see if he wasn't
a hundred percent focused.

2395
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:43,420
I want to see him one more
time focused with Guzman,

2396
01:00:43,470 --> 01:00:45,230
but like with,

2397
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:46,270
with um,

2398
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:46,970
um,

2399
01:00:46,970 --> 01:00:51,140
with pseudo and TJ caught
behind the air stopped early.

2400
01:00:51,170 --> 01:00:51,410
All right.

2401
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:52,161
Rematch for sure.

2402
01:00:52,161 --> 01:00:52,994
Rematch.

2403
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:54,230
Other guys where it's quick.

2404
01:00:54,410 --> 01:00:55,221
Cain Velasquez,

2405
01:00:55,221 --> 01:00:56,320
jds quick rematch.

2406
01:00:56,330 --> 01:01:00,890
Let's do it rather back when you get out
class for 25 minutes and there's two,

2407
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:01,401
eight,

2408
01:01:01,401 --> 01:01:02,234
10 rounds,

2409
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:03,680
it's tough to,

2410
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:04,600
there's no way off.

2411
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:05,720
See documentary match.

2412
01:01:05,810 --> 01:01:06,011
Yes.

2413
01:01:06,011 --> 01:01:06,950
So who told you TJ?

2414
01:01:06,951 --> 01:01:07,281
You could,

2415
01:01:07,281 --> 01:01:09,310
you could really call for
a rematch in that fight.

2416
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:13,190
The UFC is going to make Woodley's path
to that title shot a fucking nightmare

2417
01:01:13,191 --> 01:01:13,550
man.

2418
01:01:13,550 --> 01:01:14,540
Who stopped that fight?

2419
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,460
So Hutto and Tj who stopped that fight?

2420
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,140
Who's the referee in that fight?

2421
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:19,641
And I don't know.

2422
01:01:19,641 --> 01:01:20,474
Is that herb?

2423
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:21,410
Yeah.

2424
01:01:21,410 --> 01:01:22,130
No,

2425
01:01:22,130 --> 01:01:22,963
no.

2426
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:23,803
Who Was it?

2427
01:01:25,550 --> 01:01:27,740
So Leon Roberts was the one who separated.

2428
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:29,150
Damien Maia.

2429
01:01:29,710 --> 01:01:31,680
Robin Roberts.

2430
01:01:31,770 --> 01:01:32,840
Was it Leon Roberts?

2431
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:35,180
No.

2432
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:35,820
Oh gentlemen.

2433
01:01:35,820 --> 01:01:36,200
Uh,

2434
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:36,771
I forget his name.

2435
01:01:36,771 --> 01:01:37,700
Powerful haircut though.

2436
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:40,010
Mm.

2437
01:01:40,010 --> 01:01:40,470
So you,

2438
01:01:40,470 --> 01:01:42,620
you run that back though
because you suck early.

2439
01:01:43,490 --> 01:01:44,900
[inaudible] a tough sell.

2440
01:01:44,930 --> 01:01:46,940
They're the biggest names in that debate.

2441
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:47,190
I mean,

2442
01:01:47,190 --> 01:01:47,380
if they,

2443
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:49,080
especially if they decide
to do it at flyweight,

2444
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:53,060
they're the only names in that division
except Joseph Benevidez Benevidez who

2445
01:01:53,061 --> 01:01:54,200
also won,

2446
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:57,020
he beat so Hutto and a split decision.

2447
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:57,471
He,

2448
01:01:57,471 --> 01:01:59,720
there's a real good argument for
him fighting for the title as well,

2449
01:01:59,721 --> 01:02:00,554
for sure.

2450
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:03,890
But that fight was so
controversial and so hyped up.

2451
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:04,250
It would,

2452
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:05,460
I would like to see that fight again.

2453
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:06,333
Matches.

2454
01:02:06,670 --> 01:02:06,920
Right.

2455
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:09,320
But don't you think if anyone
deserves to be bluntly,

2456
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:10,820
how long he was just fuck yes.

2457
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:11,500
Right.

2458
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:13,930
But I would say the same
thing about Steve [inaudible].

2459
01:02:14,510 --> 01:02:17,930
Steve Bay at Super fucked was
the motherfucker for years.

2460
01:02:17,931 --> 01:02:18,320
He's the,

2461
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:20,160
he won more title fight

2462
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,680
defenses than any heavyweight
in the history of the sport.

2463
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:26,610
Who sees number one most successful
heavyweight of all time beat nothing but

2464
01:02:26,611 --> 01:02:27,390
world champions,

2465
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:27,691
right.

2466
01:02:27,691 --> 01:02:29,880
Beat nothing but world
motherfucking champions.

2467
01:02:29,881 --> 01:02:30,900
Alistair Overeem,

2468
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,780
Fabricio overdoing junior dos Santos,

2469
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:35,310
a Lawsky world,

2470
01:02:35,311 --> 01:02:38,280
motherfucking champions and uh,

2471
01:02:38,610 --> 01:02:39,001
you know,

2472
01:02:39,001 --> 01:02:43,470
and then fights and Gano who's
fucking terrifying beats in Ghana.

2473
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:45,480
Guy Can't get a break.

2474
01:02:45,670 --> 01:02:46,710
You didn't get a fight.

2475
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:47,790
Why can't he get a fight?

2476
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:49,800
Because in the cell paper views.

2477
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:51,060
That's crazy.

2478
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:53,580
The only reason the
world's a terrible place

2479
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:57,240
you could do Steve Bay cane.

2480
01:02:59,030 --> 01:03:00,170
Ah,

2481
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:03,300
well Keynes going to have to
get another knee surgery now.

2482
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:06,420
Is he for sure how the ways knee went out?

2483
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:08,190
How is it possible you heard
anything about his knee?

2484
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:09,083
I have not.

2485
01:03:10,050 --> 01:03:11,100
You don't think it was a knee problem?

2486
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,560
Think it was the uppercut
Yardeni update on his name.

2487
01:03:13,561 --> 01:03:15,030
I haven't but I haven't asked.

2488
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:15,450
You know,

2489
01:03:15,450 --> 01:03:17,190
I could probably try to meet the team,

2490
01:03:17,191 --> 01:03:18,330
his ass DC.

2491
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:22,020
His team would have really something
because his team said something really

2492
01:03:22,021 --> 01:03:24,270
ridiculous that he didn't get knocked out,

2493
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:26,910
that he got hit behind the head
with an illegal shot first.

2494
01:03:27,090 --> 01:03:29,880
How dare you and I love crazy buzz.

2495
01:03:29,881 --> 01:03:30,714
Javier.

2496
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:31,740
Javier must been,

2497
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:33,540
maybe you had a few months later on him.

2498
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:35,760
He's a down ass dude and I liked that.

2499
01:03:35,761 --> 01:03:36,040
I was like,

2500
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:38,040
but you see a ship full of shit.

2501
01:03:38,041 --> 01:03:39,380
He's down for the fresh yet.

2502
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:42,330
Well we were saying we watched
that punch and it didn't even land.

2503
01:03:42,331 --> 01:03:43,600
It landed on like the shelter,

2504
01:03:43,930 --> 01:03:45,420
the show off the shoulder,

2505
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:46,590
that short sharp.

2506
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:51,300
I just did a food truck diaries on below
the belt with Francis and he showed me

2507
01:03:51,301 --> 01:03:53,010
the exact punch cause I was like,

2508
01:03:53,011 --> 01:03:53,730
people are saying,

2509
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:54,030
he goes,

2510
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:55,020
he was not happening.

2511
01:03:55,170 --> 01:03:55,860
Yeah,

2512
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:56,340
here it is.

2513
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:57,210
Cain Velasquez,

2514
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:58,021
loss of freak.

2515
01:03:58,021 --> 01:03:59,070
My knee gave out on me,

2516
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:00,310
but now there was um,

2517
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:01,141
it wasn't him.

2518
01:04:01,141 --> 01:04:03,720
It was a Javier Vasquez said,

2519
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:04,110
uh,

2520
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:05,460
it was an illegal punch.

2521
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:05,900
Come on,

2522
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:06,733
see you.

2523
01:04:06,820 --> 01:04:07,890
She's got to take the loss back.

2524
01:04:07,891 --> 01:04:08,520
You'll have back.

2525
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:08,941
First of all,

2526
01:04:08,941 --> 01:04:11,250
it's not an illegal punch when
you're swinging on the feet.

2527
01:04:11,251 --> 01:04:12,510
It's illegal on the ground.

2528
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:12,841
If a,

2529
01:04:12,841 --> 01:04:15,720
if a guy is swinging and a guy ducks
and you hit him in the back of the head,

2530
01:04:15,721 --> 01:04:17,670
there's not a single
referee on the planet earth.

2531
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:19,110
Right?

2532
01:04:19,110 --> 01:04:21,570
There's not a single referee in the
planet earth who's ever said that's bad.

2533
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:22,553
Not only that,

2534
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:26,850
a good percentage of head kicks are
illegal shots in the air behind.

2535
01:04:26,851 --> 01:04:28,650
There are a lot of Wonderboy shots.

2536
01:04:29,050 --> 01:04:30,900
The Wonderboy likes that sneaky question.

2537
01:04:30,901 --> 01:04:31,381
Mark kick.

2538
01:04:31,381 --> 01:04:32,810
He throws that shit behind the ear.

2539
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:33,600
So it was Barb Rosa.

2540
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:35,370
So does cowboy comes
right over the shoulder.

2541
01:04:35,370 --> 01:04:35,990
Wack.

2542
01:04:35,990 --> 01:04:38,670
But with gain that
that's not even an issue.

2543
01:04:38,671 --> 01:04:39,890
Cause that punch in Atlanta,

2544
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:43,050
the issue is the upper
cut turn the lights off,

2545
01:04:43,350 --> 01:04:44,890
which causes need a buckle.

2546
01:04:45,330 --> 01:04:46,670
But here's his reno,

2547
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:47,753
he was punched.

2548
01:04:48,090 --> 01:04:49,620
If there was a knee problem with this,

2549
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:51,720
with this kind of dilemma about his knee,

2550
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:54,630
his team would have reported
he's going for knee surgery,

2551
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:55,750
there's a MCL,

2552
01:04:56,010 --> 01:04:56,820
there's nothing.

2553
01:04:56,820 --> 01:04:57,440
They're just like,

2554
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:58,160
uh,

2555
01:04:58,160 --> 01:04:58,471
all right,

2556
01:04:58,471 --> 01:04:59,304
let's just move on.

2557
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:00,720
So you do steep a camp.

2558
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:02,220
Well Holla at your boy.

2559
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:04,650
She might be in a position where he
doesn't want to have any more knee

2560
01:05:04,651 --> 01:05:05,071
surgeries,

2561
01:05:05,071 --> 01:05:05,970
but his knees were weak.

2562
01:05:06,210 --> 01:05:06,691
Come on for,

2563
01:05:06,691 --> 01:05:06,930
no,

2564
01:05:06,930 --> 01:05:07,081
no,

2565
01:05:07,081 --> 01:05:08,550
but I'm saying if you
got hit with that punch,

2566
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:11,910
maybe in another world like his knee
wouldn't have given out like that.

2567
01:05:11,911 --> 01:05:12,960
He would just kinda rocked.

2568
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,190
He would've just got rocked.

2569
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:14,880
Maybe.

2570
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:15,540
Maybe.

2571
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:16,470
But him verse Dbas,

2572
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:18,010
the fight,

2573
01:05:18,310 --> 01:05:19,143
the good fight.

2574
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:21,340
I'm sure Steve Bay would like it,

2575
01:05:21,341 --> 01:05:24,160
but I mean it's what Steve Bay
really wants us another shot at DC,

2576
01:05:24,310 --> 01:05:25,143
not I'm in Bro.

2577
01:05:25,150 --> 01:05:26,950
Maybe thinks that that's
the way to get to DC.

2578
01:05:27,220 --> 01:05:30,190
You would have done it if by now
there's a million reason to do it.

2579
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:31,960
Do you also for DC,

2580
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:33,490
it makes no sense.

2581
01:05:33,491 --> 01:05:34,660
He knocked him out so fast.

2582
01:05:34,690 --> 01:05:36,730
You can't get any more
impressive than that.

2583
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:37,961
It's kind of like Josie,

2584
01:05:37,961 --> 01:05:38,380
Joseph,

2585
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:39,100
Connor.

2586
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:39,933
Yeah.

2587
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:42,790
I fucking starched.

2588
01:05:42,791 --> 01:05:44,620
And what do you have
everything to lose now?

2589
01:05:44,970 --> 01:05:49,360
Do you want me to do so DC DC's going
to get Brock and probably right off the

2590
01:05:49,361 --> 01:05:50,170
sunset,

2591
01:05:50,170 --> 01:05:52,690
although Austrian tell
Francis he needs led DC.

2592
01:05:52,691 --> 01:05:53,381
Just do his thing.

2593
01:05:53,381 --> 01:05:54,214
Dip Out.

2594
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:56,770
He can become the heavyweight champion.

2595
01:05:57,340 --> 01:05:58,173
Yeah.

2596
01:05:58,450 --> 01:05:58,800
Um,

2597
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:02,470
and DC's looking for
like our big fight in.

2598
01:06:02,471 --> 01:06:03,304
That's it.

2599
01:06:03,550 --> 01:06:04,210
That's it.

2600
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:04,750
I mean,

2601
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:06,580
apparently his coaches have already said,

2602
01:06:06,581 --> 01:06:06,761
look,

2603
01:06:06,761 --> 01:06:09,070
you've got a real legitimate
career as a broadcaster.

2604
01:06:09,071 --> 01:06:09,611
And he does.

2605
01:06:09,611 --> 01:06:12,610
He's excellent as an analyst or the best.

2606
01:06:12,790 --> 01:06:13,420
I love it.

2607
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:14,470
That's the best relationship.

2608
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:16,510
And I'm not throwing shade at Dom.

2609
01:06:16,570 --> 01:06:17,830
I love doing it with dom too.

2610
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:19,330
I love doing it with dom.

2611
01:06:19,390 --> 01:06:20,223
I bet.

2612
01:06:20,350 --> 01:06:21,520
Not as good chemistry.

2613
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:22,120
Well,

2614
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:22,730
you know what it is.

2615
01:06:22,730 --> 01:06:24,730
It's a weird dichotomy and I are silly.

2616
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:26,013
We're silly,

2617
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:27,033
not silly.

2618
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:27,380
Dot.

2619
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:27,660
I mean,

2620
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:28,690
dom and I laugh a little,

2621
01:06:28,691 --> 01:06:30,040
but he's like Uber serious,

2622
01:06:30,041 --> 01:06:30,740
whereas an x,

2623
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:34,820
like when rose no one unit one
and he's yell out thug DC DC's,

2624
01:06:35,770 --> 01:06:36,760
he's fun man.

2625
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:40,540
You DC and annex the best commentating
team on the planet and when it's you and

2626
01:06:40,541 --> 01:06:40,990
dom,

2627
01:06:40,990 --> 01:06:44,680
there seems to be this weird dynamic
where I don't vibe with it really.

2628
01:06:44,681 --> 01:06:46,300
I think a lot of people
are on board with that.

2629
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:48,310
That's interesting
because I like it a lot.

2630
01:06:49,090 --> 01:06:49,480
Again,

2631
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:50,500
it's not bad,

2632
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:52,230
but it's like UDC and Anik and,

2633
01:06:52,270 --> 01:06:53,950
but dom without you,

2634
01:06:54,490 --> 01:06:55,181
even with you,

2635
01:06:55,181 --> 01:06:55,901
he's amazing.

2636
01:06:55,901 --> 01:06:56,734
He's one of the past,

2637
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:58,450
but it's just not as good.

2638
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:00,580
Okay.

2639
01:07:00,580 --> 01:07:01,330
I get it.

2640
01:07:01,330 --> 01:07:02,163
Um,

2641
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:03,473
it's just,

2642
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:05,260
I agree with his corner though.

2643
01:07:05,261 --> 01:07:08,590
I would like to see maybe one
more fight a DC and then look,

2644
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:10,060
he's got his wits about him.

2645
01:07:10,061 --> 01:07:11,020
He's got his brains,

2646
01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:12,070
he's fine.

2647
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:14,110
He's amazing person.

2648
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:15,880
Like when you hang out
with and talk to him,

2649
01:07:15,881 --> 01:07:19,450
he's a sweetheart of a guy the
best and he can talk great.

2650
01:07:19,930 --> 01:07:23,440
He spoke very articulately and
as a wrestler unparalleled,

2651
01:07:23,441 --> 01:07:23,891
I mean his,

2652
01:07:23,891 --> 01:07:24,611
his skill,

2653
01:07:24,611 --> 01:07:26,340
his understanding of the
game as a heavyweight,

2654
01:07:26,350 --> 01:07:27,640
you can't use the greatest fault.

2655
01:07:27,650 --> 01:07:28,960
Auntie Dana just did.

2656
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:29,570
Diddy.

2657
01:07:29,570 --> 01:07:30,820
Dan had just made that argument.

2658
01:07:30,821 --> 01:07:31,240
He said,

2659
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:32,920
I think the dcs the best of all time.

2660
01:07:32,950 --> 01:07:33,783
That's fair.

2661
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:35,290
You can totally make that argument.

2662
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:36,153
He's never lost.

2663
01:07:36,190 --> 01:07:36,831
Starched.

2664
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:38,110
Ebay was the best of all time.

2665
01:07:38,380 --> 01:07:38,681
Yeah.

2666
01:07:38,681 --> 01:07:42,460
But he's only fought once in the UFC and
heavyweight other than this with Frank

2667
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:42,461
Mir.

2668
01:07:42,461 --> 01:07:44,180
But dude went out in the strike force.

2669
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:44,920
Yeah.

2670
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:46,300
Grand Prix is insane.

2671
01:07:46,330 --> 01:07:47,050
Insane.

2672
01:07:47,050 --> 01:07:47,591
Did he fight,

2673
01:07:47,591 --> 01:07:47,890
um,

2674
01:07:47,890 --> 01:07:48,820
who else did he fight at?

2675
01:07:48,821 --> 01:07:49,990
Heavyweight in the UFC.

2676
01:07:49,991 --> 01:07:51,220
Did he fight Dom Roy?

2677
01:07:51,270 --> 01:07:55,060
He thought Roy Right Ryan that
Roy was in the EOC and Frank Mir.

2678
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:55,953
Yeah,

2679
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:57,010
it'd be both those guys.

2680
01:07:57,340 --> 01:07:57,790
Yeah.

2681
01:07:57,790 --> 01:07:59,080
It wasn't even a full beat.

2682
01:07:59,081 --> 01:08:01,900
The brakes off both of them
and then starch deep bay.

2683
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:03,880
But I think without cutting weight,

2684
01:08:03,881 --> 01:08:05,200
he just feels so much better.

2685
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:06,790
That's why if he's gonna Fight John,

2686
01:08:06,791 --> 01:08:07,361
we gotta do it.

2687
01:08:07,361 --> 01:08:07,840
A heavyweight,

2688
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:08,141
oh,

2689
01:08:08,141 --> 01:08:09,340
I know how light heavyweight goes.

2690
01:08:09,341 --> 01:08:10,174
Get outta here.

2691
01:08:11,230 --> 01:08:14,530
He thinks it was still 100%
you're doing at heavyweight.

2692
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:15,800
What do you think happens at heavyweight?

2693
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:17,390
I think DC has a chance.

2694
01:08:17,391 --> 01:08:17,691
Baby.

2695
01:08:17,691 --> 01:08:19,730
I'll put my money on because DC,

2696
01:08:19,731 --> 01:08:21,700
Kannok bitches out at heavyweight died.

2697
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:24,470
He's the one who can land on John.

2698
01:08:24,580 --> 01:08:25,400
Can you get dirty?

2699
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:27,110
Do you think that John
would want that to fight?

2700
01:08:27,410 --> 01:08:28,243
Do you think that would be,

2701
01:08:28,310 --> 01:08:30,890
that could be like a
giant 4th of July fight.

2702
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:32,211
Bom,

2703
01:08:32,211 --> 01:08:32,770
Bom,

2704
01:08:32,770 --> 01:08:33,590
Bom.

2705
01:08:33,590 --> 01:08:37,940
Why don't you and I called Dana White
and say we would like to take over the

2706
01:08:37,941 --> 01:08:39,500
matchmaker occasionally.

2707
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:43,010
Just we would like like a
celebrity matchup sorta deal.

2708
01:08:43,011 --> 01:08:45,880
Let me get my beak where I don't want
to take anything away from McMaster and

2709
01:08:45,890 --> 01:08:46,461
Sean Shelby.

2710
01:08:46,461 --> 01:08:47,294
Those guys are great,

2711
01:08:47,450 --> 01:08:48,470
but just let us,

2712
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:50,870
let us make five fights a year.

2713
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:51,733
Do you hate ratings?

2714
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:52,940
Will help you.

2715
01:08:52,970 --> 01:08:53,690
Do you hate money?

2716
01:08:53,690 --> 01:08:54,770
Promote the shit out.

2717
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:55,940
Go Bake your posters.

2718
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,130
We'll do what we can.

2719
01:08:58,190 --> 01:08:59,150
Here's what you do,

2720
01:08:59,151 --> 01:08:59,960
Uncle d.

2721
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:00,500
What do we do?

2722
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:01,840
You do DC,

2723
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:03,470
John heavyweight for the world title.

2724
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:08,500
What's the undercard Frances Brock to
really think Brock's going to take that

2725
01:09:09,141 --> 01:09:09,974
fight.

2726
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:12,220
Brock wants the title and that's right.

2727
01:09:12,230 --> 01:09:14,360
He wants DC DC's almost terrible.

2728
01:09:14,810 --> 01:09:16,400
DC's only a little taller than me.

2729
01:09:16,550 --> 01:09:17,030
I know.

2730
01:09:17,030 --> 01:09:18,710
You know he's a real,

2731
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:19,610
don't let them fool you.

2732
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:20,060
Yeah,

2733
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:21,200
it looks small and like,

2734
01:09:21,530 --> 01:09:22,370
like your dad,

2735
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:22,731
you know,

2736
01:09:22,731 --> 01:09:23,840
but he'll beat the shit out.

2737
01:09:23,841 --> 01:09:24,740
He'll beat the shit out of you.

2738
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:25,521
He's a tank.

2739
01:09:25,521 --> 01:09:25,821
He says,

2740
01:09:25,821 --> 01:09:30,821
why does a house and you know dude Brock
wants Dude Brock Francis picture the

2741
01:09:31,851 --> 01:09:32,684
poster.

2742
01:09:32,810 --> 01:09:34,880
Just take that and pictures
of the hospital bill.

2743
01:09:34,940 --> 01:09:35,773
Oh,

2744
01:09:36,530 --> 01:09:36,891
picture.

2745
01:09:36,891 --> 01:09:39,470
Brock's the remaining
years of Brock's life.

2746
01:09:39,530 --> 01:09:40,810
I asked Francis of asking,

2747
01:09:40,820 --> 01:09:41,410
he got,

2748
01:09:41,410 --> 01:09:41,690
he goes,

2749
01:09:41,690 --> 01:09:42,140
I don't,

2750
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:42,770
I don't,

2751
01:09:42,770 --> 01:09:43,580
I don't chase.

2752
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:44,450
I chase nobody.

2753
01:09:44,451 --> 01:09:45,590
You're not serious.

2754
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:48,990
He flew to,

2755
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:52,970
the funny thing is you standing next to
Francis is almost like me standing next

2756
01:09:52,971 --> 01:09:53,804
to you.

2757
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:55,820
He's so damn big.

2758
01:09:55,850 --> 01:09:55,941
Oh,

2759
01:09:55,941 --> 01:09:56,450
did you?

2760
01:09:56,450 --> 01:09:58,010
So we on the curb,

2761
01:09:58,450 --> 01:09:59,121
we're on a curb.

2762
01:09:59,121 --> 01:10:00,440
I go stand here dude.

2763
01:10:00,441 --> 01:10:01,430
You are like huge.

2764
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:05,320
And everyone's going to freak out
on the Internet and he's so big.

2765
01:10:05,321 --> 01:10:08,120
He looks huge to 65 natural.

2766
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:09,100
I asked him,

2767
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:10,070
well what do you walk around that?

2768
01:10:10,130 --> 01:10:10,641
That's what he said.

2769
01:10:10,641 --> 01:10:12,380
And he was 60 65 six.

2770
01:10:12,381 --> 01:10:15,800
Did you ask him about
wrestling a little bit,

2771
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:16,880
you know,

2772
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:17,930
with those food truck tires.

2773
01:10:17,931 --> 01:10:20,270
I tried to get a little silly
and get those guys to have fun

2774
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:23,150
with Francis.

2775
01:10:23,390 --> 01:10:24,320
He talked about how he,

2776
01:10:24,321 --> 01:10:26,350
how he kind of felt like
a loser after the steep.

2777
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:27,050
A fight.

2778
01:10:27,050 --> 01:10:28,010
Well there's no,

2779
01:10:28,011 --> 01:10:28,701
no way around.

2780
01:10:28,701 --> 01:10:29,534
It was fastened.

2781
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:29,960
No,

2782
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:32,930
it's fascinating conversation you say
he's saying I kind of felt like a loser

2783
01:10:32,931 --> 01:10:36,520
and how he didn't feel like himself and
now he felt pressured to take the fight.

2784
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:37,550
He was not ready.

2785
01:10:37,670 --> 01:10:40,340
How well is he like talking
you think I could get him on?

2786
01:10:40,370 --> 01:10:41,420
Do you think it would work?

2787
01:10:42,410 --> 01:10:43,243
Be Tough.

2788
01:10:43,730 --> 01:10:44,563
Be Tough.

2789
01:10:44,690 --> 01:10:46,070
He's getting better at English though.

2790
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:48,980
Cause when I first interviewed him I
remember way back in the day when I first,

2791
01:10:48,981 --> 01:10:49,820
when you had the dreads,

2792
01:10:50,210 --> 01:10:51,050
I first interviewed him.

2793
01:10:51,051 --> 01:10:53,270
He was having a real hard
time understanding me.

2794
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:54,741
But he's,

2795
01:10:54,741 --> 01:10:55,940
he's definitely better at it now.

2796
01:10:55,941 --> 01:10:57,030
He's getting better and he,

2797
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:57,890
you know,

2798
01:10:57,890 --> 01:10:58,071
yeah.

2799
01:10:58,071 --> 01:11:00,560
When he loosens up it'd be
tough to do two hours with you.

2800
01:11:00,650 --> 01:11:03,320
Dana White says Daniel Cormier is
getting the Brock Lesnar fight.

2801
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:03,561
Yeah,

2802
01:11:03,561 --> 01:11:05,360
but we don't have a
Bronx duals that today.

2803
01:11:06,190 --> 01:11:07,880
This post is from an hour ago.

2804
01:11:08,850 --> 01:11:09,683
Ooh,

2805
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:12,980
Brock Lesnar folks.

2806
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:13,381
He said at,

2807
01:11:13,381 --> 01:11:14,670
at the post fight press conference.

2808
01:11:15,030 --> 01:11:19,650
I saw that there's no announcements when
Dee said when core me is fully healed

2809
01:11:19,651 --> 01:11:20,460
from his injuries.

2810
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:21,420
Oh he's got an injury.

2811
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:21,691
Yeah,

2812
01:11:21,691 --> 01:11:22,440
he's been injured.

2813
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:23,273
What's going on?

2814
01:11:23,510 --> 01:11:24,180
Um,

2815
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:28,770
I forget he had a problem with his hand
for the Derrick Lewis fight decided to

2816
01:11:28,771 --> 01:11:29,730
take the fight anyway.

2817
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:32,070
And because Steve Bay offered the
fight and that's why he's like,

2818
01:11:32,071 --> 01:11:32,251
dude,

2819
01:11:32,251 --> 01:11:32,761
I'm injured.

2820
01:11:32,761 --> 01:11:35,490
I'm not going to fight you
when I'm injured guys fight.

2821
01:11:35,491 --> 01:11:38,740
Derrick Lewis must feel
like shit for steep bay.

2822
01:11:38,741 --> 01:11:39,301
He must be like,

2823
01:11:39,301 --> 01:11:39,991
God damn it.

2824
01:11:39,991 --> 01:11:40,950
You feel bad for Steve Bay?

2825
01:11:41,010 --> 01:11:41,843
Yeah.

2826
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:44,280
Cause like if Daniel
Cormay wasn't injured,

2827
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:45,870
he would've got that shot.

2828
01:11:47,090 --> 01:11:47,250
Look,

2829
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:48,240
it was hand was okay.

2830
01:11:48,241 --> 01:11:50,010
He would have got that shot in New York,

2831
01:11:50,070 --> 01:11:51,960
but now Steve Bay's never
going to get that shot.

2832
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:52,590
Dude.

2833
01:11:52,590 --> 01:11:53,460
How about John?

2834
01:11:53,461 --> 01:11:53,970
Steve,

2835
01:11:53,970 --> 01:11:54,820
I feel terror.

2836
01:11:54,850 --> 01:11:55,670
Spit balling.

2837
01:11:55,670 --> 01:11:56,730
I like gems here,

2838
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:57,600
but I feel,

2839
01:11:57,750 --> 01:12:02,400
I feel terrible for Steve Bay to
really do because I mean there's,

2840
01:12:02,670 --> 01:12:04,500
how long has it been
since he lost the title?

2841
01:12:04,501 --> 01:12:06,040
A year and a hot year.

2842
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:07,493
A year.

2843
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:10,500
How long has it been and
he's tried to fight June

2844
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:13,500
two 26 decent.

2845
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:13,951
My Gosh,

2846
01:12:13,951 --> 01:12:16,470
he's from 26 so it wasn't a year.

2847
01:12:16,770 --> 01:12:17,790
DC's flat twice.

2848
01:12:18,010 --> 01:12:18,840
More than a year.

2849
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:19,673
February,

2850
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:21,053
February,

2851
01:12:22,950 --> 01:12:23,730
fuck.

2852
01:12:23,730 --> 01:12:24,510
July.

2853
01:12:24,510 --> 01:12:24,661
Oh,

2854
01:12:24,661 --> 01:12:25,291
what are you talking about?

2855
01:12:25,291 --> 01:12:26,100
Do you not know how to count?

2856
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:26,271
No.

2857
01:12:26,271 --> 01:12:27,104
That's wrong with you.

2858
01:12:27,180 --> 01:12:27,780
I dare you.

2859
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:28,490
I didn't cut,

2860
01:12:28,490 --> 01:12:29,980
what'd you say to 26 oh.

2861
01:12:30,470 --> 01:12:31,303
Oh,

2862
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:32,580
I thought you were saying that.

2863
01:12:32,710 --> 01:12:35,610
You're not 26 I was like,

2864
01:12:35,611 --> 01:12:36,444
how dare you,

2865
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:40,740
but still on dare you make that
mistake you will ever see two 26 okay,

2866
01:12:41,220 --> 01:12:42,030
well that's July.

2867
01:12:42,030 --> 01:12:43,170
So that's not quite a year.

2868
01:12:43,390 --> 01:12:44,161
He's been relevant.

2869
01:12:44,161 --> 01:12:45,750
He's fought twice since that loss.

2870
01:12:45,751 --> 01:12:46,281
Loss of Steve.

2871
01:12:46,281 --> 01:12:47,114
He hasn't fought.

2872
01:12:49,470 --> 01:12:50,303
It's heartbreaking.

2873
01:12:50,890 --> 01:12:51,723
Damn.

2874
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:53,381
Jon Jones,

2875
01:12:53,381 --> 01:12:54,214
Steve Bay

2876
01:12:55,690 --> 01:12:58,630
coach Javier Mendez can understand
wise TPB Osha is waiting for,

2877
01:12:58,690 --> 01:12:59,680
he needs to move on.

2878
01:12:59,710 --> 01:13:00,610
It's not happening.

2879
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:03,010
I don't think he necessarily
is waiting for it.

2880
01:13:03,011 --> 01:13:03,161
No,

2881
01:13:03,161 --> 01:13:03,940
he is.

2882
01:13:03,940 --> 01:13:05,560
He even contact it.

2883
01:13:05,830 --> 01:13:06,641
He wants it,

2884
01:13:06,641 --> 01:13:10,090
but I don't think they're offering
him a valid fight him in the meantime,

2885
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:12,410
I haven't heard any big fights that are,

2886
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:13,510
that are being mentioned.

2887
01:13:13,730 --> 01:13:15,520
I mean obviously I could be wrong,

2888
01:13:17,490 --> 01:13:18,323
you know.

2889
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:19,000
Well the only,

2890
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,490
the only thing they could really
offer him is what is funny.

2891
01:13:21,491 --> 01:13:24,830
I have all these questions and
I don't ever call Dana and he,

2892
01:13:24,970 --> 01:13:25,570
dude,

2893
01:13:25,570 --> 01:13:26,470
come on Bro.

2894
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:29,380
I don't call Sean Shelby and I'll call
them McMahon or I just sit here with you.

2895
01:13:29,381 --> 01:13:30,214
We Talk Shit.

2896
01:13:32,050 --> 01:13:33,010
We just speculate.

2897
01:13:33,370 --> 01:13:34,203
Total stroke,

2898
01:13:34,990 --> 01:13:35,980
total speculation.

2899
01:13:36,010 --> 01:13:36,860
It was interesting being on it.

2900
01:13:36,861 --> 01:13:37,960
Espn for the first time.

2901
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:39,273
That was interesting.

2902
01:13:39,310 --> 01:13:39,970
How so?

2903
01:13:39,970 --> 01:13:40,721
Different countries doing.

2904
01:13:40,721 --> 01:13:40,931
Yeah.

2905
01:13:40,931 --> 01:13:41,231
Well look,

2906
01:13:41,231 --> 01:13:42,730
I'm holding an ESPN,

2907
01:13:42,790 --> 01:13:44,950
a handle on the microphone,

2908
01:13:44,980 --> 01:13:45,281
you know,

2909
01:13:45,281 --> 01:13:45,491
it was,

2910
01:13:45,491 --> 01:13:47,440
it was interesting and
knowing that it's on ESPN,

2911
01:13:48,130 --> 01:13:48,963
it's very exciting.

2912
01:13:49,450 --> 01:13:52,540
It's very exciting to know that it's on
ESPN now cause I think that's going to

2913
01:13:52,541 --> 01:13:54,370
make a big deal with casual fans.

2914
01:13:54,371 --> 01:13:57,760
I think it's going to allow the sport
to grow and the ESPN fights were

2915
01:13:57,761 --> 01:13:58,594
spectacular.

2916
01:13:58,600 --> 01:13:59,650
They put on a good product.

2917
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:00,071
They did it.

2918
01:14:00,071 --> 01:14:00,880
What's cool job.

2919
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:02,310
When I turned on ESPN,

2920
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:03,160
I do every morning,

2921
01:14:03,310 --> 01:14:08,310
I start my morning is they had a picture
of Bryce Harper who just signed like a

2922
01:14:08,441 --> 01:14:12,550
$3 million deal with the
Philadelphia and Jon Jones.

2923
01:14:12,660 --> 01:14:13,540
That was the flyer.

2924
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:14,321
Wow.

2925
01:14:14,321 --> 01:14:15,640
It's like it's mainstream.

2926
01:14:15,670 --> 01:14:16,420
That's giant.

2927
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:17,860
Like Fox could never do that.

2928
01:14:18,130 --> 01:14:18,580
No,

2929
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:18,791
no.

2930
01:14:18,791 --> 01:14:19,900
Fox was great.

2931
01:14:19,901 --> 01:14:24,400
And Fox put the UFC on the map and I
think Fox really did a fantastic job over

2932
01:14:24,401 --> 01:14:25,234
those seven years.

2933
01:14:25,540 --> 01:14:25,990
But there's a,

2934
01:14:25,990 --> 01:14:27,040
it's a big difference.

2935
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:28,510
Going to ESPN is like,

2936
01:14:28,511 --> 01:14:29,201
Holy Shit,

2937
01:14:29,201 --> 01:14:30,220
we're on ESPN.

2938
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:32,840
It's like Tisdale for sports fields.

2939
01:14:32,841 --> 01:14:34,150
Didn't go to any fucking sports part.

2940
01:14:34,151 --> 01:14:35,140
ESPN is always on.

2941
01:14:35,141 --> 01:14:38,410
So every fight is on and you're
going to have a shit ton of fights.

2942
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:42,460
And if you have ESPN plus you
could watch all the old fights.

2943
01:14:42,950 --> 01:14:43,510
You know what?

2944
01:14:43,510 --> 01:14:44,470
Bless at the bottom.

2945
01:14:44,471 --> 01:14:46,840
Just a scroller say Jon
Jones like breaking news.

2946
01:14:46,870 --> 01:14:47,770
Espn inks,

2947
01:14:47,771 --> 01:14:51,400
exclusive rights deal with
PFL mixed martial arts league.

2948
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:51,701
Oh,

2949
01:14:51,701 --> 01:14:52,534
interesting.

2950
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:54,070
What is a p?

2951
01:14:54,130 --> 01:14:54,880
O that's things.

2952
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:55,600
Um,

2953
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:56,171
that's my boy,

2954
01:14:56,171 --> 01:14:59,740
Seth is League Thursdays I believe.

2955
01:14:59,741 --> 01:15:02,620
I think they have something like
10 events for the year right now.

2956
01:15:02,650 --> 01:15:03,130
Okay.

2957
01:15:03,130 --> 01:15:04,630
That is excellent.

2958
01:15:04,631 --> 01:15:06,430
And they have a player that is excellent.

2959
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:07,980
That is so good for,

2960
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:08,860
for MMA.

2961
01:15:08,860 --> 01:15:09,790
It's so good.

2962
01:15:09,970 --> 01:15:13,240
10 PFL events in 2019 outstanding.

2963
01:15:13,270 --> 01:15:15,460
They do the line across ESPN two,

2964
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:16,391
ESPN,

2965
01:15:16,391 --> 01:15:17,740
Deportes daisy and ESPN plus.

2966
01:15:17,770 --> 01:15:19,000
Fantastic.

2967
01:15:19,210 --> 01:15:20,110
So good.

2968
01:15:20,350 --> 01:15:21,580
So good for everybody.

2969
01:15:22,780 --> 01:15:24,490
I can't believe Vinny Magalhaes lost.

2970
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:25,151
I was so,

2971
01:15:25,151 --> 01:15:25,984
so,

2972
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:26,861
so sure.

2973
01:15:26,861 --> 01:15:27,820
He's going to win the whole thing.

2974
01:15:28,650 --> 01:15:28,871
I mean,

2975
01:15:28,871 --> 01:15:30,520
he's so fucking good man.

2976
01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:33,460
And when it comes to the
ground game is like freak.

2977
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:34,353
He's a freak.

2978
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:35,950
He's not a light
heavyweight on the planet.

2979
01:15:35,970 --> 01:15:40,480
Esp on also just signed Tyson fury really
interests and now you're not getting

2980
01:15:40,481 --> 01:15:40,840
Tyson.

2981
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:41,673
Deontay wilder.

2982
01:15:41,710 --> 01:15:42,880
I heard about that.

2983
01:15:42,881 --> 01:15:44,290
What the fuck is that about?

2984
01:15:44,291 --> 01:15:44,560
What?

2985
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:45,130
What did,

2986
01:15:45,130 --> 01:15:48,850
what did Tyson say something crazy
like why would he fight him again?

2987
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:49,660
Um,

2988
01:15:49,660 --> 01:15:51,550
when he got robbed of a decision,

2989
01:15:51,551 --> 01:15:52,810
the last fight I heard that,

2990
01:15:52,811 --> 01:15:53,620
I was like,

2991
01:15:53,620 --> 01:15:54,550
is he drinking again?

2992
01:15:54,670 --> 01:15:55,360
Dude,

2993
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:55,631
Dude,

2994
01:15:55,631 --> 01:15:56,380
how about this?

2995
01:15:56,380 --> 01:15:56,980
How about this?

2996
01:15:56,980 --> 01:15:57,820
How about showtime?

2997
01:15:57,821 --> 01:15:58,654
My Boys,

2998
01:15:58,750 --> 01:15:59,800
they had the trailer,

2999
01:15:59,801 --> 01:16:03,340
they had the hype video
ready to launch on Monday.

3000
01:16:03,460 --> 01:16:05,620
Tyson signed with ESPN Monday morning.

3001
01:16:06,130 --> 01:16:07,150
No one knew.

3002
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:09,640
Nobody fucking knew.

3003
01:16:09,970 --> 01:16:10,631
I feel bad for it.

3004
01:16:10,631 --> 01:16:14,860
Deontae it's heartbreak bat for deontic
cause Deontae almost put them out in

3005
01:16:14,861 --> 01:16:15,790
that final round.

3006
01:16:16,210 --> 01:16:16,600
You know?

3007
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:19,180
And I think you can make a
real argument that Tyson one,

3008
01:16:19,181 --> 01:16:20,530
the decision for sure,

3009
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:24,820
but when you get dropped twice and
get dropped one time and most horrific

3010
01:16:24,821 --> 01:16:25,654
fashion,

3011
01:16:26,470 --> 01:16:27,303
I mean,

3012
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:29,080
and now they say the fights not happening.

3013
01:16:29,180 --> 01:16:30,220
That's crazy.

3014
01:16:31,220 --> 01:16:32,470
It's the biggest problem in boxing.

3015
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:35,733
So angry.

3016
01:16:35,740 --> 01:16:36,730
That makes me angry.

3017
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:37,090
That does.

3018
01:16:37,090 --> 01:16:38,050
There's different promoters.

3019
01:16:38,051 --> 01:16:41,560
That's why the UFC jumped frog
the boxing a long time sorta.

3020
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:42,251
But I mean look,

3021
01:16:42,251 --> 01:16:43,630
that fight could have been made.

3022
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:46,420
Do you think that may be Tyson
didn't want to fight him again?

3023
01:16:46,570 --> 01:16:47,050
Nope.

3024
01:16:47,050 --> 01:16:47,381
I think,

3025
01:16:47,381 --> 01:16:48,041
I think it's his,

3026
01:16:48,041 --> 01:16:49,060
his handlers is,

3027
01:16:49,061 --> 01:16:49,480
is,

3028
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:50,500
is representation.

3029
01:16:50,501 --> 01:16:51,334
Go Dude,

3030
01:16:51,730 --> 01:16:52,930
let's sign with ESPN.

3031
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:54,250
Get a seven figure deal.

3032
01:16:54,251 --> 01:16:57,010
You can fight two bumps and
then we'll circle back to wild.

3033
01:16:57,640 --> 01:16:57,941
Well,

3034
01:16:57,941 --> 01:16:59,320
may boxing maybe.

3035
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:02,890
I mean there's argument that
that's a good move financially.

3036
01:17:03,130 --> 01:17:03,963
I guess.

3037
01:17:04,330 --> 01:17:05,110
It's heartbreaking.

3038
01:17:05,110 --> 01:17:06,190
Heartbreaking.

3039
01:17:06,550 --> 01:17:07,383
Right here.

3040
01:17:07,660 --> 01:17:08,493
Oh Dude,

3041
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:12,201
here it is.

3042
01:17:12,201 --> 01:17:13,034
I wanted to cry.

3043
01:17:14,450 --> 01:17:15,283
I want to cry.

3044
01:17:15,710 --> 01:17:16,543
That's sad.

3045
01:17:16,910 --> 01:17:19,250
But it does open up Anthony,

3046
01:17:19,251 --> 01:17:21,200
Joshua Deontay wilder,

3047
01:17:21,830 --> 01:17:22,850
which is very sad.

3048
01:17:22,860 --> 01:17:23,571
But yeah,

3049
01:17:23,571 --> 01:17:23,991
nothing.

3050
01:17:23,991 --> 01:17:28,610
No time soon cause Deontae still gonna
fight and may maybe dealing white maybe

3051
01:17:28,611 --> 01:17:29,444
Louis Ortiz.

3052
01:17:29,570 --> 01:17:30,090
Yeah.

3053
01:17:30,090 --> 01:17:32,030
Lose her t's is still fucking dangerous.

3054
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:33,170
Dealing White's a motherfucker.

3055
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:33,800
Yeah.

3056
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:36,830
So then you know yet
Anthony Joshua be great,

3057
01:17:36,831 --> 01:17:37,410
but he's fine.

3058
01:17:37,410 --> 01:17:38,243
David Miller.

3059
01:17:38,510 --> 01:17:39,260
Yeah.

3060
01:17:39,260 --> 01:17:40,400
And that's a tough fight for him.

3061
01:17:40,850 --> 01:17:42,590
Big Baby Miller's got some fucking power.

3062
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:44,150
You don't think so?

3063
01:17:44,150 --> 01:17:44,660
No.

3064
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,130
That's a Madison Square Garden to right.

3065
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:47,571
First Time Anthony.

3066
01:17:47,571 --> 01:17:49,050
Joshua was fighting in
the United States though.

3067
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:49,520
Yup.

3068
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:52,400
When you fight in the United
States [inaudible] fuck Tyson fury.

3069
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:53,293
Wow.

3070
01:17:55,190 --> 01:17:56,023
Brazil.

3071
01:17:56,660 --> 01:17:57,890
That seems like a fake name.

3072
01:17:58,490 --> 01:18:00,560
It's like he's a former football player.

3073
01:18:00,580 --> 01:18:01,940
Got The dude's name is breeze.

3074
01:18:01,970 --> 01:18:03,260
You'd call him Brazil.

3075
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:07,460
Fuck Dominic Brazil boxing's in May.

3076
01:18:07,461 --> 01:18:08,220
My mandatory.

3077
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:09,080
So frustrating.

3078
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:11,270
However you got Mikey Garcia.

3079
01:18:11,271 --> 01:18:12,200
Earl Spence coming up.

3080
01:18:12,230 --> 01:18:13,063
That's amazing.

3081
01:18:13,070 --> 01:18:13,431
We should do,

3082
01:18:13,431 --> 01:18:14,264
if I can paint for that.

3083
01:18:14,270 --> 01:18:15,103
When is that?

3084
01:18:15,230 --> 01:18:16,070
March something?

3085
01:18:17,150 --> 01:18:17,990
Am I in town?

3086
01:18:17,991 --> 01:18:18,824
I don't know.

3087
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:20,640
We should do a final name for boxing.

3088
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:22,970
We don't have any fight
companions for boxing,

3089
01:18:23,660 --> 01:18:24,493
right?

3090
01:18:24,690 --> 01:18:24,920
Yeah.

3091
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:26,000
Give me an excuse to do.

3092
01:18:26,001 --> 01:18:26,340
Hold on.

3093
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:26,610
Sorry.

3094
01:18:26,610 --> 01:18:27,600
That's a good one to do it all.

3095
01:18:27,650 --> 01:18:28,131
What does it say,

3096
01:18:28,131 --> 01:18:28,910
Jamie?

3097
01:18:28,910 --> 01:18:29,743
What do we got?

3098
01:18:30,890 --> 01:18:31,460
Oh,

3099
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:32,293
Daddy's home.

3100
01:18:32,510 --> 01:18:33,500
Daddy's in Miami,

3101
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:35,760
but Miami and profit.

3102
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:37,190
That's my sweet spot of a bitch.

3103
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:39,993
Yeah,

3104
01:18:40,930 --> 01:18:41,763
next Saturday.

3105
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:42,713
Yeah,

3106
01:18:42,950 --> 01:18:46,340
the fucks it already
March 4th crazy to miss.

3107
01:18:46,341 --> 01:18:50,330
This year's flying by January
was looking to see 85 years old.

3108
01:18:50,331 --> 01:18:51,164
Before you know it,

3109
01:18:51,190 --> 01:18:54,200
we're going to be like Larry
merchant over here talking shit.

3110
01:18:54,530 --> 01:18:54,910
Everyone.

3111
01:18:54,910 --> 01:18:56,270
Larry Merchant said to Floyd Mayweather,

3112
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:57,333
I was your age.

3113
01:18:57,350 --> 01:18:58,430
I'd kick your ass.

3114
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:01,160
Classic fucking class.

3115
01:19:01,310 --> 01:19:02,870
Just a ridiculous thing to say.

3116
01:19:03,970 --> 01:19:05,450
Greatest boxers of all time.

3117
01:19:06,220 --> 01:19:07,053
Oh,

3118
01:19:07,430 --> 01:19:10,490
he's fucking such a
crotchety old dude though.

3119
01:19:11,660 --> 01:19:12,560
It's going to be us one day.

3120
01:19:12,710 --> 01:19:13,521
85 years old.

3121
01:19:13,521 --> 01:19:14,354
Calling fights,

3122
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:15,980
getting old.

3123
01:19:15,980 --> 01:19:19,010
Just today you think would still
be doing companions oldest?

3124
01:19:19,011 --> 01:19:19,750
Fuck yeah.

3125
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:20,010
Yeah.

3126
01:19:20,010 --> 01:19:20,481
Well,

3127
01:19:20,481 --> 01:19:23,000
someone's going to drink
themselves to death on a live show.

3128
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:24,470
It's probably going to be Eddie.

3129
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:25,393
I'll have a hard time.

3130
01:19:28,020 --> 01:19:29,960
We said we should start
bringing it to other people too.

3131
01:19:29,961 --> 01:19:30,531
Occasionally,

3132
01:19:30,531 --> 01:19:32,530
especially when a cow is out of town,

3133
01:19:32,531 --> 01:19:33,590
cause counts always busy.

3134
01:19:34,580 --> 01:19:35,413
Yeah,

3135
01:19:36,110 --> 01:19:37,130
but he brings the cheese,

3136
01:19:37,730 --> 01:19:39,260
the nothing's like the four of us though.

3137
01:19:39,261 --> 01:19:40,520
The chemistry with the finance.

3138
01:19:40,521 --> 01:19:41,001
You can't,

3139
01:19:41,001 --> 01:19:41,840
you can't fuck with it.

3140
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:42,321
No.

3141
01:19:42,321 --> 01:19:46,130
It is the best and it's the most
fun by far is the most fun to watch.

3142
01:19:46,210 --> 01:19:47,330
It's a different dynamic,

3143
01:19:48,140 --> 01:19:49,160
but the talking over,

3144
01:19:49,161 --> 01:19:49,521
my God,

3145
01:19:49,521 --> 01:19:50,570
I tried to listen to it.

3146
01:19:50,780 --> 01:19:51,613
You did.

3147
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:52,570
I try to listen to someone.

3148
01:19:52,580 --> 01:19:54,170
What you do is I want to
know what it sounded like.

3149
01:19:54,171 --> 01:19:55,300
We were just talking over everybody.

3150
01:19:55,430 --> 01:19:56,210
It's terrible.

3151
01:19:56,210 --> 01:19:59,660
I haven't been that drunk and high
and a long time and it was awesome.

3152
01:20:01,790 --> 01:20:03,740
People for whatever reason,

3153
01:20:03,741 --> 01:20:06,110
love those kind of chaos shows like that.

3154
01:20:06,111 --> 01:20:08,580
Alex Jones show the love chaos.

3155
01:20:08,790 --> 01:20:09,300
They'll love it.

3156
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:14,300
They'll love a strong and stoned and
an interdimensional child molesters and

3157
01:20:14,671 --> 01:20:15,390
fucking,

3158
01:20:15,390 --> 01:20:16,290
they love all that shit.

3159
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:17,430
They love it off the charts.

3160
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:19,530
Nuts that Alex Jones one though.

3161
01:20:19,531 --> 01:20:20,110
I told you I've,

3162
01:20:20,110 --> 01:20:21,240
I've never been a fan of his.

3163
01:20:21,241 --> 01:20:21,851
Then I watch it.

3164
01:20:21,851 --> 01:20:23,370
I'm like gotta like them now.

3165
01:20:23,550 --> 01:20:24,383
People are mad.

3166
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:25,470
Some people are mad at me,

3167
01:20:25,471 --> 01:20:25,951
but you know,

3168
01:20:25,951 --> 01:20:26,980
there's nothing I can do about that.

3169
01:20:26,981 --> 01:20:28,020
There were going to be mad at me anyway,

3170
01:20:28,021 --> 01:20:29,730
but one of the things
that they were saying was,

3171
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:30,301
you know,

3172
01:20:30,301 --> 01:20:32,130
fuck you for uh,

3173
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:35,600
there were saying giving them a
platform for normalizing him and Mike,

3174
01:20:35,610 --> 01:20:37,410
you gotta understand
that's how I know him.

3175
01:20:37,770 --> 01:20:39,240
I know him like that.

3176
01:20:39,270 --> 01:20:40,110
That's how I know him.

3177
01:20:40,111 --> 01:20:41,130
I know that guy,

3178
01:20:41,430 --> 01:20:42,263
that guy,

3179
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:44,250
that guy that came on here,

3180
01:20:44,550 --> 01:20:48,180
and this is the guy that by the way on
his show said he was gonna kick my ass

3181
01:20:48,181 --> 01:20:51,210
and break my legs and fucking all kinds
of crazy shit and I want to find them

3182
01:20:51,211 --> 01:20:52,020
the UFC fight.

3183
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:54,060
I'm going to offer him $1 million.

3184
01:20:54,061 --> 01:20:56,400
Like I knew,

3185
01:20:56,670 --> 01:20:57,503
I knew him.

3186
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,770
I know the real him.

3187
01:20:58,950 --> 01:20:59,580
I'm like,

3188
01:20:59,580 --> 01:20:59,701
well,

3189
01:20:59,701 --> 01:21:00,630
we're not in front of each other.

3190
01:21:00,631 --> 01:21:01,560
You could say crazy shit.

3191
01:21:01,561 --> 01:21:03,450
And like I'm immune man.

3192
01:21:03,451 --> 01:21:03,741
I do it.

3193
01:21:03,741 --> 01:21:04,381
I don't care.

3194
01:21:04,381 --> 01:21:05,214
It doesn't bother me.

3195
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:06,353
I don't care anymore.

3196
01:21:06,450 --> 01:21:07,680
He's doing entertainment show.

3197
01:21:07,710 --> 01:21:08,700
He is doing entertainment.

3198
01:21:08,701 --> 01:21:09,210
But,

3199
01:21:09,210 --> 01:21:11,670
but what I know is the Alex Jones,

3200
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:12,091
those here,

3201
01:21:12,091 --> 01:21:12,601
and by the way,

3202
01:21:12,601 --> 01:21:13,980
he was right about a lot of shit.

3203
01:21:14,310 --> 01:21:18,390
A lot of the crazy shit that he was saying
about fucking human pig hybrids that

3204
01:21:18,391 --> 01:21:23,391
they're working on those and actually
making human pig hybrid fetuses.

3205
01:21:24,390 --> 01:21:25,223
That's real.

3206
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:26,250
They really aren't.

3207
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:26,841
The problem is,

3208
01:21:26,841 --> 01:21:29,610
is he throws so much shit
out there all at one time.

3209
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:31,260
I don't know what to
believe in what exactly.

3210
01:21:31,261 --> 01:21:34,020
And you got to slow them down to look
into all of that and you've got to go

3211
01:21:34,021 --> 01:21:34,350
slow.

3212
01:21:34,350 --> 01:21:34,491
Whoa,

3213
01:21:34,491 --> 01:21:34,641
Whoa,

3214
01:21:34,641 --> 01:21:34,771
Whoa,

3215
01:21:34,771 --> 01:21:34,980
whoa.

3216
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:35,850
Let's take start.

3217
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:36,713
Start over again.

3218
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:37,470
What,

3219
01:21:37,470 --> 01:21:38,460
what's happening on the moon?

3220
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:41,700
He's for sure little crazy.

3221
01:21:41,701 --> 01:21:42,480
I liked him,

3222
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:43,050
but he's,

3223
01:21:43,050 --> 01:21:43,740
he's crazy.

3224
01:21:43,740 --> 01:21:48,740
But I think the crazy is okay and it's
entertaining and I'm not a fucking child.

3225
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:54,150
So if you want a nerf the world and
make the world so that only children can

3226
01:21:54,151 --> 01:21:55,950
watch everybody cause like make,

3227
01:21:55,951 --> 01:21:56,784
make things

3228
01:21:57,950 --> 01:21:59,100
that are safe for everyone,

3229
01:21:59,101 --> 01:21:59,940
including children.

3230
01:22:00,210 --> 01:22:00,451
Well,

3231
01:22:00,451 --> 01:22:01,560
I don't want that.

3232
01:22:01,590 --> 01:22:01,861
I want,

3233
01:22:01,861 --> 01:22:03,240
I'm a discerning adults.

3234
01:22:03,330 --> 01:22:06,540
I'm pretty rational and I can figure
out what's real and what's nonsense.

3235
01:22:06,870 --> 01:22:07,350
Dude.

3236
01:22:07,350 --> 01:22:08,340
Speaking of children.

3237
01:22:08,490 --> 01:22:09,780
Did you see the Michael Jackson?

3238
01:22:09,781 --> 01:22:10,351
I did not,

3239
01:22:10,351 --> 01:22:11,400
but I heard it was horrific.

3240
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:12,593
It's crazy.

3241
01:22:12,750 --> 01:22:13,021
You don't,

3242
01:22:13,021 --> 01:22:14,760
Tim Dillon is so fucking funny.

3243
01:22:14,900 --> 01:22:16,260
If you see Tim Dillon snake,

3244
01:22:17,010 --> 01:22:19,330
Tim Dillon is pretending that
Michael Jackson was a pimp,

3245
01:22:19,331 --> 01:22:20,340
but he was bagging bitches.

3246
01:22:20,490 --> 01:22:20,701
Good.

3247
01:22:20,701 --> 01:22:22,710
It was good with his Instagram.

3248
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:24,900
If you had Tim on your show,

3249
01:22:24,990 --> 01:22:25,800
is that the big guy?

3250
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:26,633
Yeah,

3251
01:22:26,710 --> 01:22:27,600
they give the comic.

3252
01:22:27,601 --> 01:22:28,110
Yes.

3253
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:28,470
No,

3254
01:22:28,470 --> 01:22:28,741
dude,

3255
01:22:28,741 --> 01:22:29,574
you got to get him on,

3256
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:30,030
um,

3257
01:22:30,030 --> 01:22:32,520
on any times in town and
he's fucking hilarious.

3258
01:22:32,550 --> 01:22:33,383
He says,

3259
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:34,051
yeah,

3260
01:22:34,051 --> 01:22:35,430
he's a funny dude.

3261
01:22:36,150 --> 01:22:36,983
He listen to this.

3262
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:37,520
Listen to,

3263
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:39,690
this is Michael Jackson documentaries.

3264
01:22:39,730 --> 01:22:41,490
There's no fucking music in it.

3265
01:22:41,610 --> 01:22:43,410
The whole thing is fucking boring.

3266
01:22:43,411 --> 01:22:44,940
It's all fucking interviews.

3267
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:47,310
I fast forwarded through all that shit.

3268
01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:50,850
I want to see the bitch is the
guys the king of fucking pop.

3269
01:22:50,970 --> 01:22:51,451
You know,

3270
01:22:51,451 --> 01:22:52,201
he's fucking,

3271
01:22:52,201 --> 01:22:53,220
all the time.

3272
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:55,170
He was fucking Elvis's daughter,

3273
01:22:55,171 --> 01:22:56,460
Lisa Marie Presley.

3274
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:57,011
You know,

3275
01:22:57,011 --> 01:23:00,330
Neverland ranch was just fucking pussy
because they're trying to make him look.

3276
01:23:00,331 --> 01:23:01,680
That goes from humanitarian.

3277
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:02,191
Oh,

3278
01:23:02,191 --> 01:23:03,270
we help sick kids.

3279
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:04,590
He lets him sleep with them.

3280
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:05,261
We get it.

3281
01:23:05,261 --> 01:23:06,220
He was a good guy

3282
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:07,120
and another thing,

3283
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:08,090
so there's this scene.

3284
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:13,240
I was a kind of half listening apparently
some kid walked in on him fucking some

3285
01:23:13,241 --> 01:23:16,840
bitch and the kid knows
like every one of his moves,

3286
01:23:17,170 --> 01:23:17,801
everything.

3287
01:23:17,801 --> 01:23:18,371
He was fucking,

3288
01:23:18,371 --> 01:23:18,701
he was like,

3289
01:23:18,701 --> 01:23:22,810
what kind of sick kid sneaks into
Michael's room while he's fucking a chick?

3290
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:24,220
It's kind of crazy.

3291
01:23:24,370 --> 01:23:25,450
That's the problem with kids.

3292
01:23:25,451 --> 01:23:29,170
That's why you can help kids
word to the wise help adults.

3293
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:32,460
It just shits is correct.

3294
01:23:33,390 --> 01:23:34,680
It's a ridiculous guy.

3295
01:23:34,681 --> 01:23:35,370
Matt,

3296
01:23:35,370 --> 01:23:36,160
you got,

3297
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:37,470
you have them on too.

3298
01:23:37,471 --> 01:23:38,304
He's very funny.

3299
01:23:38,350 --> 01:23:40,440
He's super into conspiracy theories.

3300
01:23:40,470 --> 01:23:41,140
Oh is he?

3301
01:23:41,140 --> 01:23:41,470
Yeah.

3302
01:23:41,470 --> 01:23:41,850
Yeah.

3303
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:42,361
Deep End.

3304
01:23:42,361 --> 01:23:43,081
He brought me a book,

3305
01:23:43,081 --> 01:23:44,060
so you want to bring you back,

3306
01:23:44,150 --> 01:23:45,060
bring it back to the fold,

3307
01:23:45,090 --> 01:23:46,080
but he's a smart guy.

3308
01:23:46,290 --> 01:23:47,460
Real funny dude.

3309
01:23:47,461 --> 01:23:49,080
When he said when he had him on,

3310
01:23:49,081 --> 01:23:50,670
he said the comments are brutal.

3311
01:23:50,671 --> 01:23:52,200
Shab because someone said,

3312
01:23:52,470 --> 01:23:52,651
oh,

3313
01:23:52,651 --> 01:23:54,480
why's Rogan haven't Roseanne on again?

3314
01:23:58,030 --> 01:23:58,890
You see Roseanne,

3315
01:23:59,070 --> 01:24:01,760
she went on Kennesaw and set
up all of the me too girl,

3316
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:05,280
bunch of hose and they were all just
selling sex to try to get successful.

3317
01:24:05,310 --> 01:24:06,150
Hilarious.

3318
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:07,890
Rosanna doesn't give a fuck.

3319
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:08,701
Especially now.

3320
01:24:08,701 --> 01:24:09,534
They forced her out.

3321
01:24:10,290 --> 01:24:10,920
Good,

3322
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:11,753
good.

3323
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:13,320
But they fucked up so hard.

3324
01:24:13,321 --> 01:24:13,891
Kicking her out.

3325
01:24:13,891 --> 01:24:16,360
That show is number one and
now no one even cares about.

3326
01:24:17,430 --> 01:24:18,870
I don't see a market.

3327
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:21,480
They might keep it on just for spite,

3328
01:24:21,780 --> 01:24:22,950
just so she couldn't say,

3329
01:24:22,951 --> 01:24:24,420
I told you sow,

3330
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:25,830
but we know no one's watching it.

3331
01:24:25,831 --> 01:24:26,150
Yeah,

3332
01:24:26,150 --> 01:24:26,370
yeah,

3333
01:24:26,370 --> 01:24:27,600
you fucked one's watching it.

3334
01:24:27,940 --> 01:24:28,773
Yeah.

3335
01:24:29,790 --> 01:24:31,590
I don't want to watch that
Michael Jackson thing.

3336
01:24:32,340 --> 01:24:32,731
First of all,

3337
01:24:32,731 --> 01:24:33,181
it's weird.

3338
01:24:33,181 --> 01:24:34,080
Come on that alive.

3339
01:24:34,380 --> 01:24:35,750
He's not alive to defend themselves.

3340
01:24:36,770 --> 01:24:38,820
It's also stories and you know,

3341
01:24:40,830 --> 01:24:44,700
people tell the truth in stories
sometimes and sometimes they don't and you

3342
01:24:44,701 --> 01:24:45,450
don't know.

3343
01:24:45,450 --> 01:24:46,150
You don't know.

3344
01:24:46,150 --> 01:24:46,380
And,

3345
01:24:46,380 --> 01:24:48,120
and also there was,

3346
01:24:48,180 --> 01:24:48,720
you know,

3347
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:50,070
it was always weird like people,

3348
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:55,100
no one knew why with all the rumors that
everybody had ever heard about Michael

3349
01:24:55,380 --> 01:24:55,381
Jackson,

3350
01:24:55,381 --> 01:24:58,710
that anybody would let their
kids go and hang out with him.

3351
01:24:58,711 --> 01:25:00,290
Like when you watched the documentary,

3352
01:25:00,310 --> 01:25:02,070
like these parents are fucking moron.

3353
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:02,881
I don't get it,

3354
01:25:02,881 --> 01:25:03,410
man.

3355
01:25:03,410 --> 01:25:04,310
Two of the fathers,

3356
01:25:04,311 --> 01:25:06,620
I've committed suicide
since this happened.

3357
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:08,200
Oh

3358
01:25:09,550 --> 01:25:10,383
Christ.

3359
01:25:11,020 --> 01:25:13,240
When we don't have any hard,

3360
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:14,400
oh,

3361
01:25:14,401 --> 01:25:15,480
he was molesting kids.

3362
01:25:15,481 --> 01:25:16,200
Right.

3363
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:17,250
All we have is rumors.

3364
01:25:17,430 --> 01:25:17,761
Well,

3365
01:25:17,761 --> 01:25:18,594
here's the thing.

3366
01:25:19,070 --> 01:25:19,710
He was acquitted.

3367
01:25:19,710 --> 01:25:20,580
Here's the problem.

3368
01:25:20,670 --> 01:25:21,630
The doctor,

3369
01:25:21,660 --> 01:25:24,610
his very doctor said that
he was chemically castrated.

3370
01:25:24,611 --> 01:25:25,740
Him about the guy who killed them.

3371
01:25:26,070 --> 01:25:26,520
Yes.

3372
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:26,910
Yeah.

3373
01:25:26,910 --> 01:25:30,450
That guy said he was chemically castrated
by his parents to protect his voice.

3374
01:25:31,060 --> 01:25:32,100
I have no testosterone.

3375
01:25:32,130 --> 01:25:32,400
Right,

3376
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:33,120
exactly.

3377
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:35,420
Not just no testosterone units.

3378
01:25:36,750 --> 01:25:37,320
I mean me,

3379
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:37,940
I don't think so.

3380
01:25:37,940 --> 01:25:40,010
One or the other weird things
I saw that was like facts.

3381
01:25:40,011 --> 01:25:40,611
You should hear it.

3382
01:25:40,611 --> 01:25:40,821
No,

3383
01:25:40,821 --> 01:25:42,770
from the documentary was that he had,

3384
01:25:42,890 --> 01:25:43,723
uh,

3385
01:25:44,450 --> 01:25:46,580
some something to do with
the sound in the room.

3386
01:25:46,730 --> 01:25:51,730
The hallway leading up to his bedroom was
wired so that footprint's would make a

3387
01:25:51,861 --> 01:25:53,210
ding dong sound in the room.

3388
01:25:53,930 --> 01:25:58,460
It's just a very strange thing to
just have in general for any purpose.

3389
01:25:58,910 --> 01:26:00,350
But if you grow up in the spotlight,

3390
01:26:00,351 --> 01:26:02,180
because remember he was such a big star,

3391
01:26:02,390 --> 01:26:03,980
you might have anxiety,

3392
01:26:04,420 --> 01:26:04,720
right?

3393
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:05,880
Maybe they didn't want
him to be walking in.

3394
01:26:05,910 --> 01:26:06,980
I'm a naked or something.

3395
01:26:07,030 --> 01:26:09,880
Or you don't want anyone walking
in while you touch in boys.

3396
01:26:09,900 --> 01:26:10,640
Could be that.

3397
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:12,160
Look who the fuck we don't know.

3398
01:26:12,170 --> 01:26:12,890
We don't know.

3399
01:26:12,890 --> 01:26:13,723
However,

3400
01:26:14,030 --> 01:26:14,863
what do you think Jamie?

3401
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:16,011
I know,

3402
01:26:16,011 --> 01:26:16,940
I'm just saying some of the facts.

3403
01:26:16,941 --> 01:26:17,391
I remember he,

3404
01:26:17,391 --> 01:26:20,450
he spent like 30 straight nights
with like a 12 year old at his,

3405
01:26:20,451 --> 01:26:24,230
at his house in between the kid's Mom's
house in his dad's house and they're

3406
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:26,760
divorce and there's certain
paying for somebody somewhere.

3407
01:26:27,650 --> 01:26:30,140
There's so much video of him in
this little boy holding hands.

3408
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:32,000
And the boy in the video goes,

3409
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:32,481
yeah,

3410
01:26:32,481 --> 01:26:34,490
we would hold hands and we had a signal,

3411
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:37,640
we'd rub each other's poems when we
were thinking sexually about each other.

3412
01:26:40,490 --> 01:26:41,323
However,

3413
01:26:41,420 --> 01:26:43,580
you got to chalk it up
to the shitty pants.

3414
01:26:43,730 --> 01:26:46,190
Cause if John Legend came to my house,

3415
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:46,551
it was like,

3416
01:26:46,551 --> 01:26:47,120
dude,

3417
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:47,953
I love tiger.

3418
01:26:48,110 --> 01:26:49,920
You mind if I take him
out for a little while?

3419
01:26:49,930 --> 01:26:53,250
But yet your God damn mind
you're not going anywhere.

3420
01:26:53,251 --> 01:26:53,840
A lot of that.

3421
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:54,680
And John Legend's,

3422
01:26:54,681 --> 01:26:55,920
not a pedophile,

3423
01:26:55,980 --> 01:26:56,813
I'm just not known.

3424
01:26:57,020 --> 01:26:59,240
But they didn't know Michael Jackson
was that everybody knew there was

3425
01:26:59,241 --> 01:26:59,571
something.

3426
01:26:59,571 --> 01:27:04,060
I'm not at the time he was the biggest
star in the world back then in the iron

3427
01:27:04,070 --> 01:27:04,670
man.

3428
01:27:04,670 --> 01:27:07,740
People in the nineties yes.

3429
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:08,170
Yes.

3430
01:27:08,170 --> 01:27:08,821
Good music.

3431
01:27:08,821 --> 01:27:09,654
You fuck

3432
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:12,620
everybody knew something was really I did.

3433
01:27:12,621 --> 01:27:14,150
And he was always telling my kids.

3434
01:27:14,210 --> 01:27:15,870
Yeah cause he loved Neil Young.

3435
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:16,810
Younger than us.

3436
01:27:16,810 --> 01:27:17,240
Wait,

3437
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:18,073
you got to trust me.

3438
01:27:21,410 --> 01:27:26,120
I knew something was up that Jamie's more
on the ball then you saw he was always

3439
01:27:26,121 --> 01:27:26,541
online.

3440
01:27:26,541 --> 01:27:27,351
You're out getting pussy.

3441
01:27:27,351 --> 01:27:28,184
James Online

3442
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:31,120
looked at well,

3443
01:27:31,190 --> 01:27:32,023
well played Sir.

3444
01:27:32,510 --> 01:27:33,343
Well played.

3445
01:27:33,470 --> 01:27:35,690
I just feel like it's too weird.

3446
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:39,290
It's too weird to let your kids
hang out with this grown man.

3447
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:40,430
All those times.

3448
01:27:40,431 --> 01:27:40,530
I,

3449
01:27:40,530 --> 01:27:41,480
he was mentally ill.

3450
01:27:41,570 --> 01:27:42,770
They and what his family says,

3451
01:27:42,771 --> 01:27:42,981
they go,

3452
01:27:42,981 --> 01:27:43,170
no,

3453
01:27:43,170 --> 01:27:43,610
no.

3454
01:27:43,610 --> 01:27:45,650
A lot of you are confusing him for being,

3455
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:46,820
he didn't have a childhood.

3456
01:27:47,090 --> 01:27:47,511
His Dad,

3457
01:27:47,511 --> 01:27:48,344
Robert with his child.

3458
01:27:48,580 --> 01:27:50,930
So inside he felt like
he was nine years old.

3459
01:27:51,020 --> 01:27:53,630
So he missed out on the
sleepovers and video games.

3460
01:27:53,810 --> 01:27:55,910
So he would get friends with kids.

3461
01:27:55,911 --> 01:27:56,960
And I think

3462
01:27:58,460 --> 01:27:59,780
it's batshit crazy,

3463
01:27:59,810 --> 01:28:00,650
batshit crazy.

3464
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:02,540
I think all those things
that you're saying are true,

3465
01:28:02,810 --> 01:28:06,200
but I also think it's true that he
was probably chemically castrated.

3466
01:28:06,590 --> 01:28:09,050
I really think that's true because
I've said that a long time ago.

3467
01:28:09,050 --> 01:28:09,580
I said,

3468
01:28:09,580 --> 01:28:10,401
I think he's a cast.

3469
01:28:10,401 --> 01:28:11,740
Trato the waste,

3470
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:13,280
his voice is hah,

3471
01:28:13,480 --> 01:28:14,313
hah.

3472
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:16,260
Tell them that it's human nature.

3473
01:28:17,030 --> 01:28:20,060
It's just that voice is
just not a man's voice.

3474
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:21,580
She was not even a falsetto.

3475
01:28:21,670 --> 01:28:22,190
Yep.

3476
01:28:22,190 --> 01:28:23,060
A woman's voice.

3477
01:28:23,061 --> 01:28:23,721
Castrated.

3478
01:28:23,721 --> 01:28:25,980
Then when he would have zero
testosterone nonetheless,

3479
01:28:25,990 --> 01:28:26,630
kits,

3480
01:28:26,630 --> 01:28:26,811
well,

3481
01:28:26,811 --> 01:28:29,210
he might not have been doing
it because he was horny.

3482
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:31,430
It might've been doing it
because he was just weird.

3483
01:28:31,431 --> 01:28:31,521
Well,

3484
01:28:31,521 --> 01:28:33,140
these kits as he was busted nuts,

3485
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:37,010
the kids in the video said like you
would jack himself off in front of them.

3486
01:28:38,750 --> 01:28:39,170
Boy,

3487
01:28:39,170 --> 01:28:39,360
it,

3488
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:41,990
it'll make you sick to your
stomach is not his wife,

3489
01:28:41,991 --> 01:28:45,560
but the woman that gave birth to his
two kids said she'd never had sex with

3490
01:28:45,561 --> 01:28:45,860
them.

3491
01:28:45,860 --> 01:28:46,340
Yeah,

3492
01:28:46,340 --> 01:28:47,270
that's more likely.

3493
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:51,260
If you're chemically castrated,

3494
01:28:51,261 --> 01:28:53,670
that means your body doesn't
produce any testosterone anymore,

3495
01:28:53,690 --> 01:28:57,620
but it doesn't mean you can't shoot
it into your body and you know,

3496
01:28:57,621 --> 01:28:59,780
you could shoot test into your body,

3497
01:28:59,810 --> 01:29:01,400
but if you have no net not,

3498
01:29:01,410 --> 01:29:02,400
you're not making seaman.

3499
01:29:02,550 --> 01:29:02,751
Yeah,

3500
01:29:02,751 --> 01:29:04,050
have your balls are dead,

3501
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:09,360
but you isn't semen or sperm sperm from
the nuts and then like your prostate and

3502
01:29:09,361 --> 01:29:11,430
I said are the things that
get the juice together,

3503
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:15,510
not a doctor.

3504
01:29:16,170 --> 01:29:17,003
Clearly

3505
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:20,910
the whole thing is fucking super weird.

3506
01:29:21,060 --> 01:29:21,980
It's weird.

3507
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:23,250
It just makes me sad.

3508
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:24,600
It makes me so sad,

3509
01:29:24,810 --> 01:29:25,820
but there's like a,

3510
01:29:25,830 --> 01:29:26,200
there's a,

3511
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:29,490
there's a lesson to be learned
there in so many different ways,

3512
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:34,170
but one of the big lessons to be learned
is that you never want to be that

3513
01:29:34,171 --> 01:29:37,140
famous that that was my takeaway.

3514
01:29:37,141 --> 01:29:38,870
I W I W I was watching my grind.

3515
01:29:38,970 --> 01:29:39,420
I go,

3516
01:29:39,420 --> 01:29:40,920
can you imagine being that famous?

3517
01:29:41,370 --> 01:29:42,000
And she goes,

3518
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:42,181
yeah,

3519
01:29:42,181 --> 01:29:43,014
I was probably awesome.

3520
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:43,231
No,

3521
01:29:43,231 --> 01:29:44,064
hold on.

3522
01:29:44,370 --> 01:29:45,570
You know how we like to go to the mall?

3523
01:29:45,571 --> 01:29:46,530
We like go out to eat.

3524
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:47,633
That's gone.

3525
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:48,900
You can't do that anymore.

3526
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:49,890
That's all gone.

3527
01:29:49,890 --> 01:29:50,521
It's all gone.

3528
01:29:50,521 --> 01:29:51,354
People would book,

3529
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:52,320
but they'll start a riot.

3530
01:29:52,350 --> 01:29:52,981
But take that,

3531
01:29:52,981 --> 01:29:57,180
take that away from your
normal life is not over.

3532
01:29:57,450 --> 01:29:58,770
You just stay in your house.

3533
01:29:59,340 --> 01:30:00,210
But yeah,

3534
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:02,130
that's why he developed an amusement park.

3535
01:30:02,430 --> 01:30:03,181
Like he made his house,

3536
01:30:03,181 --> 01:30:04,440
I'll fucking amusement park.

3537
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:06,300
They had,

3538
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:08,910
they set this up for him
to go grocery shopping.

3539
01:30:09,310 --> 01:30:14,280
They had a fake the empty at a grocery
store and paid people to be a shoppers so

3540
01:30:14,281 --> 01:30:17,010
he could have the experience
of what it's like to be normal.

3541
01:30:17,850 --> 01:30:19,470
They're like a Ralph's or whatever.

3542
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:20,413
Yeah.

3543
01:30:21,640 --> 01:30:22,300
Like,

3544
01:30:22,300 --> 01:30:22,561
hey,

3545
01:30:22,561 --> 01:30:23,394
how's it going?

3546
01:30:24,690 --> 01:30:25,523
Jesus,

3547
01:30:25,900 --> 01:30:26,733
this is,

3548
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:27,031
well,

3549
01:30:27,031 --> 01:30:27,864
they should make everything.

3550
01:30:28,910 --> 01:30:31,570
So he hired people to do that,

3551
01:30:31,571 --> 01:30:32,000
but,

3552
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,550
and he wore a hat and
he's dancing around that.

3553
01:30:36,060 --> 01:30:37,830
It's so weird.

3554
01:30:37,860 --> 01:30:38,880
Everything was weird,

3555
01:30:38,881 --> 01:30:39,210
man.

3556
01:30:39,210 --> 01:30:40,850
Everything was bad form though.

3557
01:30:40,980 --> 01:30:41,731
Oh yeah.

3558
01:30:41,731 --> 01:30:43,080
So we know how much he's worth.

3559
01:30:43,620 --> 01:30:44,100
I Dunno.

3560
01:30:44,100 --> 01:30:45,900
One point $7 billion,

3561
01:30:45,901 --> 01:30:46,500
they say,

3562
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:47,730
but that's after he died.

3563
01:30:47,750 --> 01:30:47,971
It see,

3564
01:30:47,971 --> 01:30:48,960
the thing is when he died,

3565
01:30:48,961 --> 01:30:49,830
he got super rich.

3566
01:30:49,831 --> 01:30:52,110
He was actually in the
hole before he died.

3567
01:30:52,140 --> 01:30:52,651
No.

3568
01:30:52,651 --> 01:30:53,130
Because there's,

3569
01:30:53,130 --> 01:30:55,890
because it wasn't tour hammer broke
where when he talked to Mc Hammer,

3570
01:30:55,891 --> 01:30:56,071
he's like,

3571
01:30:56,071 --> 01:30:56,904
what are you talking about?

3572
01:30:57,060 --> 01:30:57,331
He's like,

3573
01:30:57,331 --> 01:30:58,164
there's like,

3574
01:30:58,640 --> 01:30:59,370
you know,

3575
01:30:59,370 --> 01:31:01,950
publicists broke where they
released that you go bankrupt.

3576
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:03,000
And so it was fun.

3577
01:31:03,090 --> 01:31:03,923
I was balling.

3578
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:05,433
Hmm.

3579
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:06,560
I think it was Michael Jackson.

3580
01:31:07,070 --> 01:31:08,400
He owned the Beatles catalog.

3581
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:10,220
Oh.

3582
01:31:10,260 --> 01:31:11,370
So that's where he had all his money.

3583
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:12,900
He bought all the originals.

3584
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:14,420
The masters of his and the beat.

3585
01:31:16,020 --> 01:31:16,410
Yeah.

3586
01:31:16,410 --> 01:31:18,480
Paul Mccartney was mad about
that apparent when he told him.

3587
01:31:18,540 --> 01:31:19,440
He gave me the idea.

3588
01:31:20,010 --> 01:31:20,910
Paul gave me idea.

3589
01:31:21,900 --> 01:31:22,430
Good idea.

3590
01:31:22,430 --> 01:31:22,680
Oh,

3591
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:23,513
I'll be right back.

3592
01:31:23,940 --> 01:31:25,830
So why Paul by it,

3593
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:26,581
he's got money.

3594
01:31:26,581 --> 01:31:27,414
You can afford it.

3595
01:31:28,020 --> 01:31:30,540
Here's one fourth of the Beatles money.

3596
01:31:30,660 --> 01:31:34,020
Not all of it combining to take help you.

3597
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:36,380
There's no stars like Michael Jackson.

3598
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:37,500
You can't write,

3599
01:31:37,501 --> 01:31:38,280
can't do anything.

3600
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:39,150
Current society,

3601
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:40,441
there's,

3602
01:31:40,441 --> 01:31:42,660
there's pockets now you
also in happy birthday,

3603
01:31:43,770 --> 01:31:44,880
he owned happy birthday.

3604
01:31:44,910 --> 01:31:46,020
He bought the rights to it.

3605
01:31:46,260 --> 01:31:47,011
So that's why you weren't,

3606
01:31:47,011 --> 01:31:49,320
you're not allowed to sing
in a restaurant that's over.

3607
01:31:49,321 --> 01:31:52,200
I think you can say it now cause
it's back into the public domain.

3608
01:31:53,990 --> 01:31:55,770
That's why everyone syncs the bullshit.

3609
01:31:55,771 --> 01:31:56,371
Happy Birthday.

3610
01:31:56,371 --> 01:31:56,611
Happy,

3611
01:31:56,611 --> 01:31:57,480
happy birthday.

3612
01:31:57,481 --> 01:31:57,811
Happy,

3613
01:31:57,811 --> 01:31:58,051
happy,

3614
01:31:58,051 --> 01:32:02,200
happy thing like ASCAP or Bmi could
literally come in and just find the

3615
01:32:02,201 --> 01:32:02,621
restaurant.

3616
01:32:02,621 --> 01:32:05,110
If you were sitting in that
shit cause I'm Michael.

3617
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:06,220
That's so stupid.

3618
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:06,551
Dude.

3619
01:32:06,551 --> 01:32:08,860
Water ball or move with a copywriter.

3620
01:32:09,070 --> 01:32:10,690
Happy Birthday money.

3621
01:32:11,220 --> 01:32:14,680
Too bad he doesn't like bitches cause
that'd be the biggest movie ever.

3622
01:32:15,250 --> 01:32:17,080
Maybe did like I who knows?

3623
01:32:17,190 --> 01:32:19,570
Well the guy's dead.

3624
01:32:20,350 --> 01:32:22,060
He can't the Fafsa on the SPEC shop.

3625
01:32:22,090 --> 01:32:22,923
Here's the thing,

3626
01:32:22,990 --> 01:32:24,250
those two dudes who are doing it,

3627
01:32:24,850 --> 01:32:28,900
they were one was the key witness
when he got away in court.

3628
01:32:29,170 --> 01:32:30,003
What dudes?

3629
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:31,540
The dudes in the documentary,

3630
01:32:31,541 --> 01:32:33,490
the two we got molested.

3631
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:37,090
The one was the number one key witness
who was saying he didn't get them listed.

3632
01:32:37,420 --> 01:32:37,781
Okay,

3633
01:32:37,781 --> 01:32:39,610
well then now you shouldn't
be able to say anything.

3634
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:42,520
Both of them were with cause that means
they should go to jail and now they're

3635
01:32:42,521 --> 01:32:44,020
like well no that's not true.

3636
01:32:44,021 --> 01:32:45,670
We were young bitch you are 12

3637
01:32:47,510 --> 01:32:49,750
well also like isn't that perjury?

3638
01:32:49,930 --> 01:32:51,100
It means he lied in court.

3639
01:32:51,490 --> 01:32:52,150
Be fucked.

3640
01:32:52,150 --> 01:32:53,980
You can't lie in court either way.

3641
01:32:54,010 --> 01:32:55,000
One way or the other.

3642
01:32:55,001 --> 01:32:58,300
You can't lie to protect somebody and
you can't lie to accuse someone either.

3643
01:32:58,510 --> 01:32:59,260
You can't lie.

3644
01:32:59,260 --> 01:33:00,360
I don't know what the deal is that,

3645
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:00,641
I mean,

3646
01:33:00,641 --> 01:33:03,400
that seems like that's something they
could drag him to court for it and the

3647
01:33:03,401 --> 01:33:04,211
Jackson came out,

3648
01:33:04,211 --> 01:33:04,480
went,

3649
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:04,750
well,

3650
01:33:04,750 --> 01:33:07,840
isn't it convenient you guys are
coming out now when you're in financial

3651
01:33:07,841 --> 01:33:08,674
trouble?

3652
01:33:08,890 --> 01:33:09,790
Uh,

3653
01:33:09,791 --> 01:33:10,331
of course.

3654
01:33:10,331 --> 01:33:10,780
Yeah,

3655
01:33:10,780 --> 01:33:11,613
of course.

3656
01:33:12,040 --> 01:33:14,110
It just seems like a strange thing to do.

3657
01:33:14,111 --> 01:33:17,020
A documentary on documentaries
are killing it lately.

3658
01:33:17,110 --> 01:33:18,610
That's Kelly.

3659
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:21,490
He thought he was flying free.

3660
01:33:21,910 --> 01:33:22,750
Missing on pitches.

3661
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:25,510
Isn't that documentary came out.

3662
01:33:25,660 --> 01:33:26,493
He's fucked.

3663
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:26,681
Yeah.

3664
01:33:26,681 --> 01:33:27,220
He's fun.

3665
01:33:27,220 --> 01:33:27,760
Arrested.

3666
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:28,031
Yeah.

3667
01:33:28,031 --> 01:33:29,080
They just released him.

3668
01:33:29,081 --> 01:33:30,250
Did you see when they released him,

3669
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:31,110
like he,

3670
01:33:31,110 --> 01:33:36,110
he leaves jail and he has to walk
through a throng of people and there was

3671
01:33:36,701 --> 01:33:37,150
Scranton.

3672
01:33:37,150 --> 01:33:38,530
Some of the woman was yelling at him,

3673
01:33:38,531 --> 01:33:39,130
calling him.

3674
01:33:39,130 --> 01:33:40,810
They took his music off iTunes.

3675
01:33:41,680 --> 01:33:42,513
Really?

3676
01:33:42,550 --> 01:33:45,670
They took down all of the shit and all
the artists who worked with them took

3677
01:33:45,671 --> 01:33:46,504
their music down.

3678
01:33:46,810 --> 01:33:47,610
Like let's say,

3679
01:33:47,610 --> 01:33:50,830
let's say Michael Jackson did
get convicted of molesting kids.

3680
01:33:51,130 --> 01:33:52,600
Could you still listen to his music?

3681
01:33:52,630 --> 01:33:53,910
Could you imagine you separate,

3682
01:33:53,940 --> 01:33:54,330
right.

3683
01:33:54,330 --> 01:33:55,330
Do you know Tony Hinchcliffe?

3684
01:33:55,331 --> 01:33:56,290
I don't want to give away the bit.

3685
01:33:56,590 --> 01:33:59,590
He has a fucking hilarious bit about that.

3686
01:34:00,070 --> 01:34:01,830
He has a hilarious bit about really,

3687
01:34:02,350 --> 01:34:07,000
I bet he's redoing it now because I don't
think it's on the special on his last

3688
01:34:07,001 --> 01:34:07,421
special.

3689
01:34:07,421 --> 01:34:08,860
I don't think it's on so no,

3690
01:34:08,861 --> 01:34:09,351
I heard it.

3691
01:34:09,351 --> 01:34:10,120
Yeah.

3692
01:34:10,120 --> 01:34:10,600
Dude.

3693
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:11,433
Tony Hinchcliffe.

3694
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:12,880
He's got some fucking,

3695
01:34:13,090 --> 01:34:16,390
he's got this new bit
about transgender athletes.

3696
01:34:16,391 --> 01:34:16,781
What does it say?

3697
01:34:16,781 --> 01:34:21,781
Their daycare affiliated woman who
bailed R Kelly out of jail receives bomb

3698
01:34:22,061 --> 01:34:22,450
threat.

3699
01:34:22,450 --> 01:34:23,860
It's a mystery woman bailed him out.

3700
01:34:24,370 --> 01:34:25,480
He's looking like shit.

3701
01:34:26,610 --> 01:34:27,850
It's been stressful time.

3702
01:34:27,910 --> 01:34:28,743
Fuck yeah.

3703
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,350
We're going to so uh,

3704
01:34:32,410 --> 01:34:33,370
upcoming fights.

3705
01:34:33,550 --> 01:34:36,360
Let's get back to MMA for a few minutes
where we get the fuck out of here at

3706
01:34:36,380 --> 01:34:36,821
jds.

3707
01:34:36,821 --> 01:34:39,010
Derrick Lewis to Kelvin.

3708
01:34:39,430 --> 01:34:41,030
Kelvin Israel at a sign.

3709
01:34:41,031 --> 01:34:41,440
Yeah.

3710
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:42,700
That's what I want to see.

3711
01:34:42,701 --> 01:34:44,020
That's next month son.

3712
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:45,580
That's next month.

3713
01:34:45,610 --> 01:34:48,610
And that is in mother fucking Atlanta,

3714
01:34:48,611 --> 01:34:49,090
Georgia.

3715
01:34:49,090 --> 01:34:49,930
Is that a paper view?

3716
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:50,531
Yes it is,

3717
01:34:50,531 --> 01:34:50,950
sir.

3718
01:34:50,950 --> 01:34:52,520
You're gone do Holloway pour.

3719
01:34:52,521 --> 01:34:53,020
Yay Too.

3720
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:53,980
I'll be there for that one.

3721
01:34:54,340 --> 01:34:55,460
Holloway port A's up.

3722
01:34:55,480 --> 01:34:56,313
Great fight.

3723
01:34:56,500 --> 01:34:57,650
It is a good fight,

3724
01:34:57,740 --> 01:34:58,441
but stolen.

3725
01:34:58,441 --> 01:34:59,480
And who won the first fight?

3726
01:35:00,140 --> 01:35:01,370
Holloway Holloway One,

3727
01:35:01,371 --> 01:35:01,990
right?

3728
01:35:01,990 --> 01:35:02,823
It was a decision.

3729
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:04,333
Pretty sure.

3730
01:35:04,670 --> 01:35:05,503
Yeah.

3731
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:07,520
Just scroll up.

3732
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:08,630
Let me see what else is on that card.

3733
01:35:10,070 --> 01:35:13,680
Ovn St Peru and Nikita cry love us
right in the kidneys for a heavyweight.

3734
01:35:13,730 --> 01:35:16,430
Now he's a lighter Kaleel
Roundtree Jr Eric Anders.

3735
01:35:16,431 --> 01:35:16,760
Woo.

3736
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:17,660
That's a good fight.

3737
01:35:17,680 --> 01:35:17,970
Great.

3738
01:35:17,970 --> 01:35:18,560
But that's,

3739
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:20,120
that's under the radar fight.

3740
01:35:21,140 --> 01:35:22,640
Montel Jackson,

3741
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:23,331
you know,

3742
01:35:23,331 --> 01:35:26,990
a Johnny Walker knocked out cold
Roundtree to tea with elbows,

3743
01:35:26,991 --> 01:35:31,310
food from the clench and
[inaudible] serious striker,

3744
01:35:31,490 --> 01:35:33,090
Wilson Hayes Alhondo punt.

3745
01:35:33,091 --> 01:35:34,850
A little fact about
Cleo Roundtree you know,

3746
01:35:34,860 --> 01:35:36,470
used to be over 300 pounds.

3747
01:35:36,530 --> 01:35:38,270
Really used to be fat as fuck.

3748
01:35:38,390 --> 01:35:40,010
That's crazy because he
doesn't have any loose skin.

3749
01:35:40,160 --> 01:35:41,060
I know some guys,

3750
01:35:41,061 --> 01:35:41,810
they bounce down.

3751
01:35:41,810 --> 01:35:42,643
Good.

3752
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:46,340
He's young and he was working
in the MMA fucking warehouse.

3753
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:49,100
Well that's the same
thing with David Goggins.

3754
01:35:50,210 --> 01:35:51,043
David Goggins,

3755
01:35:51,190 --> 01:35:52,060
the uh,

3756
01:35:52,610 --> 01:35:55,070
oh maybe CBCL he bounced back to Whoa,

3757
01:35:55,071 --> 01:35:55,904
look at him.

3758
01:35:56,180 --> 01:35:56,880
10 years,

3759
01:35:56,880 --> 01:36:00,500
2010 and 2016 that's only six years.

3760
01:36:00,501 --> 01:36:01,360
Six years challenge.

3761
01:36:01,420 --> 01:36:04,640
She imagine you break up with him
and six years later he's jacked dude,

3762
01:36:04,641 --> 01:36:05,450
dime piece.

3763
01:36:05,450 --> 01:36:06,021
Look at that boy.

3764
01:36:06,021 --> 01:36:09,960
Now I'm just tired of you being off fat
getting on top of me and I can't preach.

3765
01:36:09,980 --> 01:36:10,611
It's over.

3766
01:36:10,611 --> 01:36:11,660
Kaleel now he's like,

3767
01:36:11,661 --> 01:36:12,410
what's up bitch?

3768
01:36:12,410 --> 01:36:13,243
Six years later,

3769
01:36:15,230 --> 01:36:17,150
big fat dick still dude knocked out.

3770
01:36:17,151 --> 01:36:18,800
Go Con Saki with one punch.

3771
01:36:18,950 --> 01:36:19,783
He's a beast.

3772
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:21,780
God Damn.

3773
01:36:21,780 --> 01:36:24,890
It just shows you like how crazy
powerful Johnnie Walker is,

3774
01:36:24,891 --> 01:36:25,724
man.

3775
01:36:25,910 --> 01:36:26,900
It's ridiculous.

3776
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:29,230
Ridiculously proud he'd do with him next.

3777
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:29,700
Yeah,

3778
01:36:29,700 --> 01:36:30,320
take it slow.

3779
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:31,280
Giving them good fights.

3780
01:36:31,281 --> 01:36:31,821
Don't kill him.

3781
01:36:31,821 --> 01:36:33,020
Don't give him a fee.

3782
01:36:33,090 --> 01:36:33,321
No,

3783
01:36:33,321 --> 01:36:33,590
no.

3784
01:36:33,590 --> 01:36:34,790
The TV pisses me off.

3785
01:36:34,860 --> 01:36:36,830
Does he watch so good and he,

3786
01:36:36,890 --> 01:36:37,280
he,

3787
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:39,500
you know he's not he Tory Anderson,

3788
01:36:39,501 --> 01:36:40,040
man.

3789
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:42,110
Nobody's given Cory Anderson any love.

3790
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:43,190
How weird is that?

3791
01:36:43,490 --> 01:36:44,260
I know,

3792
01:36:44,260 --> 01:36:45,093
it's weird.

3793
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:45,741
You know,

3794
01:36:45,741 --> 01:36:45,801
and,

3795
01:36:45,801 --> 01:36:45,961
and,

3796
01:36:45,961 --> 01:36:48,230
and a lot of people say it's
because he's not stopping people.

3797
01:36:48,231 --> 01:36:48,940
He's just winning.

3798
01:36:48,940 --> 01:36:51,230
He's buddies with point fucking beat.

3799
01:36:51,231 --> 01:36:54,770
He beat Latifi see you're talking about
Latifi and not talking about Corey

3800
01:36:54,770 --> 01:36:54,771
Anderson.

3801
01:36:54,771 --> 01:36:54,960
You know,

3802
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:55,700
it's here.

3803
01:36:55,700 --> 01:36:56,680
It's a lot more apps.

3804
01:36:56,681 --> 01:36:57,441
And Corey were,

3805
01:36:57,441 --> 01:36:58,280

3806
01:36:58,281 --> 01:36:58,880

3807
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:00,780
but fuck the core is a bow hunter to yep.

3808
01:37:00,790 --> 01:37:01,580
That must be fun,

3809
01:37:01,580 --> 01:37:02,413
but fuck that.

3810
01:37:02,570 --> 01:37:03,403

01:37:07,050 --> 01:37:07,461
Uh,

3814
01:37:07,461 --> 01:37:08,630
there's another one on the house.

3815
01:37:08,631 --> 01:37:09,464
Dana White.

3816
01:37:09,650 --> 01:37:10,040
Well,

3817
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:11,930
that doubt is a possibility.

3818
01:37:11,931 --> 01:37:12,380
Yeah.

3819
01:37:12,380 --> 01:37:13,880
Jimmy man was dangerous,

3820
01:37:13,881 --> 01:37:14,600
but no,

3821
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:15,680
so it was Johnny Walker.

3822
01:37:15,681 --> 01:37:16,820
Serious power to me,

3823
01:37:16,821 --> 01:37:16,971
man.

3824
01:37:16,971 --> 01:37:17,720
All it's great.

3825
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:20,370
That fight with Tiago Santos was
chaos for as long as it lasts.

3826
01:37:20,390 --> 01:37:21,120
It's amazing.

3827
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:21,610
Yeah.

3828
01:37:21,610 --> 01:37:22,460
Johnny Walker,

3829
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:23,473
Jimmy Manoa.

3830
01:37:23,990 --> 01:37:25,070
Sign me the fuck up.

3831
01:37:25,210 --> 01:37:25,590
Ooh.

3832
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:26,810
You know the brain busters.

3833
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:27,590
Ooh.

3834
01:37:27,590 --> 01:37:31,790
How do you feel like a Dustin
poray Max Holloway plays out

3835
01:37:35,030 --> 01:37:35,271
next.

3836
01:37:35,271 --> 01:37:35,571
Always.

3837
01:37:35,571 --> 01:37:36,740
So God damn talented.

3838
01:37:36,830 --> 01:37:38,930
So I'm not having to cut out 45 anymore.

3839
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:39,591
It's tough.

3840
01:37:39,591 --> 01:37:40,424
Fight for Dustin.

3841
01:37:40,580 --> 01:37:40,971
Dustin,

3842
01:37:40,971 --> 01:37:41,121
you know,

3843
01:37:41,121 --> 01:37:41,954
I love you.

3844
01:37:42,110 --> 01:37:43,820
I'm glad Dustin got a big fight.

3845
01:37:44,020 --> 01:37:45,080
[inaudible] super.

3846
01:37:45,470 --> 01:37:47,480
What's interesting is
they offered the fight.

3847
01:37:47,481 --> 01:37:48,830
Tony Ferguson turned it down,

3848
01:37:50,210 --> 01:37:53,780
but here about this Dustin
Poirier AA stops pedis.

3849
01:37:54,020 --> 01:37:54,500
Right?

3850
01:37:54,500 --> 01:37:55,350
Did he stop pedis?

3851
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:57,030
Right?

3852
01:37:57,030 --> 01:37:57,690
Um,

3853
01:37:57,690 --> 01:38:00,490
he stopped Justin Kgg.

3854
01:38:01,380 --> 01:38:02,250
Who else did he stop?

3855
01:38:02,640 --> 01:38:03,451
That was his last flight.

3856
01:38:03,451 --> 01:38:04,080
Right?

3857
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:04,560
Those two.

3858
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:06,010
But those are two world champions.

3859
01:38:06,011 --> 01:38:06,844
There was another one.

3860
01:38:07,020 --> 01:38:10,320
There was another fight in there
or he stopped somebody else.

3861
01:38:10,510 --> 01:38:11,470
Totally different animal.

3862
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:12,360
Who else did he stopped?

3863
01:38:12,690 --> 01:38:13,680
He stopped someone else.

3864
01:38:13,681 --> 01:38:14,514
It's

3865
01:38:16,050 --> 01:38:16,620
Alvarez.

3866
01:38:16,620 --> 01:38:17,270
Alvarez.

3867
01:38:17,270 --> 01:38:18,103
Eddie Alvarez.

3868
01:38:18,350 --> 01:38:19,183
Chasse fight.

3869
01:38:19,410 --> 01:38:20,243
Yeah.

3870
01:38:20,250 --> 01:38:23,070
I mean those are three
legitimate champions.

3871
01:38:23,071 --> 01:38:23,281
I mean,

3872
01:38:23,281 --> 01:38:23,580
I know.

3873
01:38:23,580 --> 01:38:26,880
Just engage you with the champion
and the PFL before it was a Pfl.

3874
01:38:26,881 --> 01:38:27,170
Right.

3875
01:38:27,170 --> 01:38:28,380
What would they call it back then?

3876
01:38:28,381 --> 01:38:29,280
World series of fighting.

3877
01:38:29,340 --> 01:38:29,850
Yeah.

3878
01:38:29,850 --> 01:38:30,810
So he,

3879
01:38:30,811 --> 01:38:32,190
when he beat him,

3880
01:38:32,250 --> 01:38:33,061
he beat Pettis.

3881
01:38:33,061 --> 01:38:35,970
He beat Eddie Alvarez and this is,

3882
01:38:36,090 --> 01:38:37,920
this is that light heavyweight jump,

3883
01:38:38,550 --> 01:38:39,120
you know?

3884
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:40,770
And you also beat Jim Miller.

3885
01:38:40,980 --> 01:38:41,251
I mean,

3886
01:38:41,251 --> 01:38:41,910
Damn.

3887
01:38:41,910 --> 01:38:44,820
His last fight was a
at 45 against Michael.

3888
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:45,181
Where's that?

3889
01:38:45,181 --> 01:38:45,271
At?

3890
01:38:45,271 --> 01:38:48,450
55 55 it might have been
55 with Michael Johnson.

3891
01:38:48,451 --> 01:38:51,590
That was before Johnson went to 45
Johnson at 45 some mother fucker.

3892
01:38:52,140 --> 01:38:53,010
He's a motherfucker.

3893
01:38:54,630 --> 01:38:54,901
Yeah,

3894
01:38:54,901 --> 01:38:55,371
I mean I'm,

3895
01:38:55,371 --> 01:38:56,640
I'm really excited about that.

3896
01:38:56,670 --> 01:38:57,590
I'm really excited about that.

3897
01:38:58,330 --> 01:38:58,981
To fight.

3898
01:38:58,981 --> 01:38:59,640
And he got it.

3899
01:38:59,640 --> 01:38:59,910
Yeah.

3900
01:38:59,910 --> 01:39:01,340
He's got an interim title idea.

3901
01:39:01,490 --> 01:39:03,060
Why Tony Ferguson turned it down.

3902
01:39:03,570 --> 01:39:04,141
I do not.

3903
01:39:04,141 --> 01:39:04,591
No,

3904
01:39:04,591 --> 01:39:07,680
I have not talked to Tony Ferguson
mean maybe it was because,

3905
01:39:07,681 --> 01:39:07,861
hey,

3906
01:39:07,861 --> 01:39:10,110
I already am the fucking
interim title holder.

3907
01:39:10,111 --> 01:39:12,180
Why would I fight for
the interim title again?

3908
01:39:12,210 --> 01:39:13,110
Max Holloway though.

3909
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:14,071
Yeah,

3910
01:39:14,071 --> 01:39:14,731
I get that.

3911
01:39:14,731 --> 01:39:18,450
But I mean he already was the interim
title holder and then they just took it

3912
01:39:18,451 --> 01:39:20,370
away from him when he was doing crap.

3913
01:39:20,430 --> 01:39:21,590
I think it's really fucked up.

3914
01:39:21,610 --> 01:39:23,190
Really comes back and beats pedis.

3915
01:39:23,340 --> 01:39:26,680
Here's what's fucked up
is now the winter Max.

3916
01:39:26,690 --> 01:39:28,470
All he doesn't he he's
guaranteed a title shot.

3917
01:39:28,580 --> 01:39:28,861
Yeah.

3918
01:39:28,861 --> 01:39:31,050
So Tony still not going to get a shot.

3919
01:39:31,770 --> 01:39:32,603
Yeah,

3920
01:39:32,940 --> 01:39:37,300
they were trying to do cowboy
versus Connor and apparently the,

3921
01:39:37,301 --> 01:39:41,160
the sticking point was that it
was going to be a co main event.

3922
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:43,660
How dare they,

3923
01:39:43,980 --> 01:39:47,700
I think the idea is that they
have to have world titles as a,

3924
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:48,600
as a main event.

3925
01:39:48,760 --> 01:39:49,593
So paper,

3926
01:39:49,970 --> 01:39:50,730
Ooh,

3927
01:39:50,730 --> 01:39:53,550
that's my west DW.

3928
01:39:54,060 --> 01:39:55,260
Get your head out of your ass.

3929
01:39:55,261 --> 01:39:56,094
You got us.

3930
01:39:56,500 --> 01:39:57,333
Shoot him a text.

3931
01:39:57,720 --> 01:39:58,630
I don't have stuff similar.

3932
01:39:58,650 --> 01:39:59,930
Hard selling hard.

3933
01:39:59,940 --> 01:40:00,773
Did he block too?

3934
01:40:00,780 --> 01:40:01,613
I think so.

3935
01:40:02,380 --> 01:40:03,800
When I seen that shit,

3936
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:05,480
I actually liked the
guy who had no problems.

3937
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:06,511
I know.

3938
01:40:06,511 --> 01:40:08,100
I tried to get you guys together.

3939
01:40:08,140 --> 01:40:09,510
I gave it my best shot.

3940
01:40:09,540 --> 01:40:10,410
I gave him my fucking,

3941
01:40:10,650 --> 01:40:11,311
you tried man.

3942
01:40:11,311 --> 01:40:12,320
Sometimes she's got an eye level.

3943
01:40:13,100 --> 01:40:13,650
Yeah,

3944
01:40:13,650 --> 01:40:14,880
I don't understand it man.

3945
01:40:15,090 --> 01:40:17,100
It's weird when you have friends
that don't like each other,

3946
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:21,120
you know when you're good friends with
both of them and they're like fuck that

3947
01:40:21,121 --> 01:40:21,301
guy.

3948
01:40:21,301 --> 01:40:21,571
And he's like,

3949
01:40:21,571 --> 01:40:21,901
all right,

3950
01:40:21,901 --> 01:40:23,950
well I don't want to tell you but I don't,

3951
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:25,170
I don't talk bad about it.

3952
01:40:25,230 --> 01:40:25,891
No you don't.

3953
01:40:25,891 --> 01:40:30,891
I criticize some Yossi decisions cause I
do a show but then I have no issue with

3954
01:40:32,101 --> 01:40:32,934
the metal.

3955
01:40:32,970 --> 01:40:33,810
I like that though.

3956
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:35,040
I mean look,

3957
01:40:35,850 --> 01:40:38,130
part of the thrill of these things,

3958
01:40:38,131 --> 01:40:39,450
it's gotta be region owl.

3959
01:40:39,690 --> 01:40:41,250
Cowboy was in my office yesterday,

3960
01:40:41,251 --> 01:40:43,800
you know him white said he wants
a Pfizer ready to it again.

3961
01:40:44,340 --> 01:40:45,220
What's fight against silicon?

3962
01:40:45,270 --> 01:40:45,961
Another opponent for him,

3963
01:40:45,961 --> 01:40:49,290
maybe raging now it does not specify
who's throwing to be fighting next.

3964
01:40:49,980 --> 01:40:50,813
So it says,

3965
01:40:51,750 --> 01:40:52,021
dude,

3966
01:40:52,021 --> 01:40:53,260
you're telling me Connor was like,

3967
01:40:53,261 --> 01:40:53,411
no,

3968
01:40:53,411 --> 01:40:55,240
I'm not taking the final
foam co main event.

3969
01:40:55,420 --> 01:41:00,130
Why in the fuck would you make that a
company could be out of action until the

3970
01:41:00,130 --> 01:41:00,550
fall.

3971
01:41:00,550 --> 01:41:01,420
Mcgregor could be,

3972
01:41:01,720 --> 01:41:01,911
you know,

3973
01:41:01,911 --> 01:41:02,290
the other things.

3974
01:41:02,290 --> 01:41:05,590
But Gregor has a fun so
long that he has a fight.

3975
01:41:05,591 --> 01:41:07,210
MMS So long.

3976
01:41:07,211 --> 01:41:08,020
Good.

3977
01:41:08,020 --> 01:41:08,441
That's fine.

3978
01:41:08,441 --> 01:41:08,700
We can,

3979
01:41:08,700 --> 01:41:09,950
his last fight was Khabib.

3980
01:41:10,090 --> 01:41:10,480
Right?

3981
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:13,630
But he takes like almost to two years off.

3982
01:41:13,660 --> 01:41:14,493
Right?

3983
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:15,640
He fights Khabib.

3984
01:41:15,970 --> 01:41:18,250
He gets smoked by Khabib and then he has,

3985
01:41:18,310 --> 01:41:18,881
how long was that?

3986
01:41:18,881 --> 01:41:19,151
How was that?

3987
01:41:19,151 --> 01:41:21,550
November was a long time off.

3988
01:41:21,610 --> 01:41:22,443
It's not good.

3989
01:41:22,570 --> 01:41:23,190
No,

3990
01:41:23,190 --> 01:41:24,220
it needs to be active,

3991
01:41:24,250 --> 01:41:25,160
like really act.

3992
01:41:25,161 --> 01:41:27,340
It's hard to be active when
you're making that much money off.

3993
01:41:27,341 --> 01:41:28,270
That's the problem.

3994
01:41:28,330 --> 01:41:29,163
The whiskey,

3995
01:41:29,350 --> 01:41:32,530
the whiskey and it need like a hundred
million dollars off the Floyd Mayweather

3996
01:41:32,531 --> 01:41:34,060
fight he's making but bup,

3997
01:41:34,061 --> 01:41:34,211
bup,

3998
01:41:34,211 --> 01:41:34,361
bup,

3999
01:41:34,361 --> 01:41:34,511
bup,

4000
01:41:34,511 --> 01:41:34,820
bup,

4001
01:41:34,820 --> 01:41:36,330
buying whiskey.

4002
01:41:36,430 --> 01:41:37,263
I'm proud of him.

4003
01:41:37,390 --> 01:41:38,130
He's doing great.

4004
01:41:38,130 --> 01:41:40,930
Tight look between you and him.

4005
01:41:41,320 --> 01:41:46,180
I mean him while he's in the middle
of his career and you post career,

4006
01:41:46,390 --> 01:41:49,540
I mean you've guys have laid some
interesting blueprints for fighters.

4007
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:50,411
So yeah.

4008
01:41:50,411 --> 01:41:51,244
The um,

4009
01:41:51,610 --> 01:41:52,540
it was October,

4010
01:41:52,900 --> 01:41:54,250
October,

4011
01:41:54,250 --> 01:41:54,251
2018.

4012
01:41:54,251 --> 01:41:55,600
That's quite a lot long time ago.

4013
01:41:57,030 --> 01:41:58,870
That's not good if it's not that far.

4014
01:41:59,410 --> 01:42:01,120
November,

4015
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:01,120
December,

4016
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:01,120
January,

4017
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:01,121
February.

4018
01:42:01,121 --> 01:42:02,050
I was like five months ago.

4019
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:04,090
It seems like a long time ago.

4020
01:42:04,091 --> 01:42:04,541
That doesn't it.

4021
01:42:04,541 --> 01:42:06,190
But he has nothing coming up so nothing.

4022
01:42:06,191 --> 01:42:06,340
I'm,

4023
01:42:06,340 --> 01:42:07,720
he fights with me another year.

4024
01:42:08,470 --> 01:42:12,910
That was his last fight and it was two
years before that was his previous fight.

4025
01:42:13,420 --> 01:42:14,253
Yeah,

4026
01:42:14,830 --> 01:42:15,880
it's not good.

4027
01:42:15,881 --> 01:42:16,714
It's not good.

4028
01:42:16,840 --> 01:42:18,970
Especially if you want
to be Creme de la creme,

4029
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:20,100
you just can't fight like that.

4030
01:42:20,170 --> 01:42:22,900
I think he's only
interested in big fights,

4031
01:42:23,050 --> 01:42:24,790
like things that excite him now.

4032
01:42:24,820 --> 01:42:25,121
You know,

4033
01:42:25,121 --> 01:42:27,940
because he's got so much
money and so much success.

4034
01:42:28,060 --> 01:42:29,050
It's just one of those things.

4035
01:42:29,080 --> 01:42:29,913
Can you blame them?

4036
01:42:30,010 --> 01:42:30,620
But here,

4037
01:42:30,620 --> 01:42:31,210
look at that,

4038
01:42:31,210 --> 01:42:32,170
that main event,

4039
01:42:32,620 --> 01:42:35,170
the main event of that
fight was a non title fight.

4040
01:42:35,200 --> 01:42:37,480
Conor verses Nate Diaz that was non title.

4041
01:42:38,050 --> 01:42:40,960
Both times they fought
and but the last one,

4042
01:42:41,130 --> 01:42:41,510
the,

4043
01:42:41,510 --> 01:42:43,180
the fact that it was a non title fight,

4044
01:42:43,181 --> 01:42:45,310
it was also the biggest
paper view of all time.

4045
01:42:46,090 --> 01:42:46,570
Dude.

4046
01:42:46,570 --> 01:42:49,800
Whoever recommended that he be
coming event against Galbally,

4047
01:42:49,940 --> 01:42:51,220
she kept their mouth's piston.

4048
01:42:51,720 --> 01:42:52,553
That's

4049
01:42:58,400 --> 01:42:59,720
so aggressive.

4050
01:43:01,480 --> 01:43:02,700
That's why Dana does it like,

4051
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:04,000
well,

4052
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:05,110
I don't know who that was,

4053
01:43:05,111 --> 01:43:05,944
but

4054
01:43:07,240 --> 01:43:09,490
I'm just saying to say that I
disagree with your decision.

4055
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:14,320
I believe I can fly.

4056
01:43:16,120 --> 01:43:16,540
All right,

4057
01:43:16,540 --> 01:43:18,490
let's wrap this up for
your voice goes out.

4058
01:43:18,491 --> 01:43:18,911
We did it,

4059
01:43:18,911 --> 01:43:19,270
dude.

4060
01:43:19,270 --> 01:43:20,920
There's no way I'm doing standup tonight.

4061
01:43:20,950 --> 01:43:21,420
No,

4062
01:43:21,420 --> 01:43:22,360
apologize to everyone.

4063
01:43:22,450 --> 01:43:22,751
Yeah,

4064
01:43:22,751 --> 01:43:23,584
you can't.

4065
01:43:23,590 --> 01:43:23,741
Well,

4066
01:43:23,741 --> 01:43:26,410
everybody who listens to this podcast
will know you're not faking it.

4067
01:43:26,440 --> 01:43:27,670
They're going to be pissed,

4068
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:28,390
Eh,

4069
01:43:28,390 --> 01:43:29,223
we're going to do,

4070
01:43:30,230 --> 01:43:34,450
you're the store tonight for this
recipe on the store tomorrow night.

4071
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:35,280
It's a stack show.

4072
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:36,770
I'll be back tomorrow night to my,

4073
01:43:36,780 --> 01:43:37,091
you're good.

4074
01:43:37,091 --> 01:43:37,571
Next week.

4075
01:43:37,571 --> 01:43:39,250
I'm back on tour in Miami Friday.

4076
01:43:39,251 --> 01:43:39,980
Saturday.

4077
01:43:39,980 --> 01:43:40,550
What'd he do off?

4078
01:43:40,550 --> 01:43:40,730
Oh,

4079
01:43:40,730 --> 01:43:41,563
Miami Improv.

4080
01:43:41,770 --> 01:43:42,461
That's next week.

4081
01:43:42,461 --> 01:43:43,091
Then after that,

4082
01:43:43,091 --> 01:43:44,020
I'm in Milwaukee,

4083
01:43:44,050 --> 01:43:44,883
Turner Hall.

4084
01:43:45,070 --> 01:43:45,641
After that,

4085
01:43:45,641 --> 01:43:46,331
I'm in Washington,

4086
01:43:46,331 --> 01:43:46,781
DC,

4087
01:43:46,781 --> 01:43:47,171
DC.

4088
01:43:47,171 --> 01:43:47,990
Improv T.

4089
01:43:47,990 --> 01:43:47,991
Dot.

01:43:47,991 --> 01:43:48,800
k.com.

4091
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:49,170
Woo.

4092
01:43:49,170 --> 01:43:49,960
Woo.

4093
01:43:49,960 --> 01:43:50,710
All right folks.

4094
01:43:50,710 --> 01:43:54,010
We'll be back tomorrow the more goodness.

4095
01:43:54,040 --> 01:43:54,490
See Ya.

4096
01:43:54,490 --> 01:43:54,850
Bye.
