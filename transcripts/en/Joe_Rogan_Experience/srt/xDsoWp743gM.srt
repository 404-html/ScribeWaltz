1
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:05,700
Three,

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,420
two,

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,253
one,

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:08,551
boom.

5
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:11,070
I don't want to start off like
this is a commercial dude,

6
00:00:11,071 --> 00:00:12,510
but this fucking thing,

7
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,300
you have this Tim Tam.

8
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,290
This is incredible.

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:16,751
It's sick.

10
00:00:16,751 --> 00:00:17,160
Oh,

11
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,160
I mean I've seen some of these different
ones online people using them thera

12
00:00:22,861 --> 00:00:25,200
things and I don't know
what they call them.

13
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,880
A third gun I think.

14
00:00:26,881 --> 00:00:29,790
But this fucking thing is amazing.

15
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:30,930
This is the most powerful one.

16
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:34,170
It has the the highest travel
and is to the best price.

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,200
So I mean it's that all the different
ones of these things online.

18
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:37,561
Yeah,

19
00:00:37,561 --> 00:00:38,400
this is the best one.

20
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,780
So what this is folks,

21
00:00:39,781 --> 00:00:43,560
we took the battery out and I'll
pop the battery back real quick.

22
00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:44,394
Go for it.

23
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,970
That's how impressed I am by this thing.

24
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,360
So I've had this nagging muscle in
my hip and then like instantaneously

25
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:01,540
you hold it folks and you'd
get it like right on the spot.

26
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:01,811
For me.

27
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:02,644
It's like right here.

28
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,510
It just loosens that motherfucker up.

29
00:01:06,511 --> 00:01:09,900
Like this is so much more
powerful than they need.

30
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,390
Those massages that you
get like from a store.

31
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:13,283
Exactly.

32
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:13,981
Don't move.

33
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:15,930
There's no massage are more
powerful than this one on the market

34
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:18,411
from mom and dad.

35
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:18,561
You know,

36
00:01:18,561 --> 00:01:19,730
this is where the guy doing a,

37
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,000
you know,

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,631
playing soccer,

39
00:01:20,631 --> 00:01:21,231
football,

40
00:01:21,231 --> 00:01:21,741
MMA,

41
00:01:21,741 --> 00:01:22,540
crossfit,

42
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,900
that's for the hardcore athletes.

43
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,010
And you invented this?

44
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,240
I started the company,

45
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:27,081
I started the company.

46
00:01:27,081 --> 00:01:28,160
I bought one of those dms,

47
00:01:28,161 --> 00:01:29,060
I don't know if you ever heard of those.

48
00:01:29,061 --> 00:01:30,500
It's called deep muscle stimulator.

49
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,750
It's kind of talking about that before.

50
00:01:32,751 --> 00:01:33,531
And I said save this,

51
00:01:33,531 --> 00:01:33,920
save this.

52
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,760
[inaudible] exactly.

53
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:35,594
So what is that?

54
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,800
The deep muscle stimulator.

55
00:01:36,801 --> 00:01:40,400
It's like a stainless steel high powered
massager that you have to plugin.

56
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,540
It cost me three grand.

57
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:42,703
I bought it.

58
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,140
It had a really bad Sadeka for two years.

59
00:01:45,141 --> 00:01:46,190
Like I almost stopped training.

60
00:01:46,191 --> 00:01:48,710
Like I almost had to take a like a
got a problem with that right now.

61
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,660
Really sad and okay this
is going to help you out.

62
00:01:50,661 --> 00:01:52,310
Big Time comes and goes big time.

63
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:53,723
I mean I was,

64
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:57,860
I was so bad I couldn't sleep like I
could not sleep because I was just go all

65
00:01:57,861 --> 00:01:58,041
the way.

66
00:01:58,041 --> 00:02:02,360
I get mine in my calf sometimes really
lucky all the way down to the calf for

67
00:02:02,361 --> 00:02:05,810
some weird reason me and went down to
the hamstring and it stopped there.

68
00:02:05,811 --> 00:02:06,340
Like I,

69
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,850
I was able to stop the problem there,

70
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,440
but they say you can go all
the way down to the calf.

71
00:02:10,441 --> 00:02:10,731
That's,

72
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:11,460
that's getting bad,

73
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,220
you know,

74
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,190
get my cat right now.

75
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:15,930
So I bought that.

76
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:16,101
Yeah.

77
00:02:16,101 --> 00:02:16,934
Mess.

78
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,001
There it is.

79
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:18,420
You know,

80
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,360
that's the DMS.

81
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:20,480
Great,

82
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,320
great machine,

83
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,321
great machine.

84
00:02:22,321 --> 00:02:23,340
But it overheats.

85
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,020
It costs three grand.

86
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,330
And what does that Piston Dude,

87
00:02:27,331 --> 00:02:30,120
is it hammer you or how much
do you it has this like this.

88
00:02:30,121 --> 00:02:30,360
Yeah,

89
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,680
but it has a lesser travel.

90
00:02:31,681 --> 00:02:32,910
This one has a greater travel.

91
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,050
So that one,

92
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,760
the DMS is a little bit to vibration.

93
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:36,960
It's not as much travel.

94
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:38,070
It's not as much percussion.

95
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,720
Percussion is which you're looking for.

96
00:02:39,721 --> 00:02:44,460
And so when I got together with
a company from the u s disrupt,

97
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,470
we put together the Tim Tam.

98
00:02:46,471 --> 00:02:46,651
Dot.

99
00:02:46,651 --> 00:02:47,484
Tech Company.

100
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:48,850
We went to

101
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:49,301
China,

102
00:02:49,301 --> 00:02:51,700
we checked out a hundred
different type of guns.

103
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:52,570
We've got this one going.

104
00:02:52,571 --> 00:02:53,530
This was the best one.

105
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:54,540
And,

106
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,110
uh,

107
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,350
this fucking things in crowd.

108
00:02:56,351 --> 00:02:56,981
It's incredible.

109
00:02:56,981 --> 00:03:00,430
And I hate to sound like this is
like paid me to do an endorsement.

110
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:01,630
He didn't folks,

111
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:03,780
this is this fucking
thing you should sell.

112
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,310
These should be flying off the chart.

113
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,200
They shouldn't even need drones.

114
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:09,850
They should just be flying themselves.

115
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:10,400
So,

116
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,140
so,

117
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,200
you know what the thing was
that deep muscle stimulators,

118
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,200
we had to share it in the gym.

119
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:14,471
This is,

120
00:03:14,471 --> 00:03:15,970
you buy your own personal gun,

121
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,570
you know,

122
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,150
and cause the deep muscle stimulator,

123
00:03:18,151 --> 00:03:19,090
it's 3000 bucks,

124
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:19,241
you know,

125
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:19,991
to lend it out.

126
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,610
Or how much is one of these four?

127
00:03:21,611 --> 00:03:22,570
It's 400 bucks.

128
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,590
It's a five year warranty.

129
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,730
That's a fucking bargain.

130
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,730
It's a bargain buddy
who trains really hard.

131
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,461
That's a bargain.

132
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:28,330
It's a massage for life.

133
00:03:28,331 --> 00:03:29,050
It's your health,

134
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:29,830
you know?

135
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,060
That's nice man.

136
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,260
It's like a saw saw.

137
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,150
Exactly.

138
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:37,300
Like you took a saws all and you put like
a little rubber ball in the end of it.

139
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,790
It's like we tried so many
other type of machines,

140
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:41,410
but they're all overheat week,

141
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,130
you know,

142
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:42,910
they're not efficient.

143
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,650
The most efficient is
already been created.

144
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:45,610
So we just retooled it.

145
00:03:45,611 --> 00:03:46,450
We just re changed it.

146
00:03:46,451 --> 00:03:48,070
We made it so that it's a,

147
00:03:48,071 --> 00:03:49,240
you can use it on the human body.

148
00:03:49,241 --> 00:03:50,320
There's some modifications made,

149
00:03:50,321 --> 00:03:50,801
but that's it.

150
00:03:50,801 --> 00:03:51,790
I mean it's pretty simple.

151
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:51,951
It's,

152
00:03:51,951 --> 00:03:54,100
it's the most efficient
type of design they have.

153
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:54,881
Yeah,

154
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:55,714
it's kind of,

155
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:00,310
it's really hard to find someone
who can massage you correctly.

156
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,350
It's very hard to find someone as good.

157
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:02,861
Exactly.

158
00:04:02,861 --> 00:04:04,570
Someone who could really
break up the tissue.

159
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,870
But even if you do like
what this thing can do,

160
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:12,040
this thing is like vibrating you and
shaking everything loose and I have a,

161
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,140
I have a cone tip I got to send you.

162
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,220
It's even goes even deeper.

163
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,870
So if he can handle deep tissue,

164
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,070
I'm going to send you a bunch of them.

165
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:18,630
Okay.

166
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:18,810
Yeah,

167
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:19,361
you're going to love it.

168
00:04:19,361 --> 00:04:20,230
We have also cold tip,

169
00:04:20,231 --> 00:04:20,770
hot tip.

170
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:21,230
It's a,

171
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,120
it's of your freezer.

172
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,430
You can freeze them because
that helps kill the pain.

173
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:28,150
So if you have an acute acute injury
like an after like a week or two and you

174
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:29,110
want to start working on it,

175
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,960
the cold of the tip helps numb the pain.

176
00:04:31,961 --> 00:04:35,260
It helps manage pain a little more and
the hot tip helps loosen up the muscle a

177
00:04:35,261 --> 00:04:36,094
little further.

178
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,330
I mostly used the content,

179
00:04:37,331 --> 00:04:39,080
the context for those who have the,

180
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,180
your experience with massage,

181
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:40,421
you're,

182
00:04:40,421 --> 00:04:40,691
you're,

183
00:04:40,691 --> 00:04:43,120
you're able to go deep tissue and uh,

184
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,050
for some people that hurts.

185
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:44,461
For me it's,

186
00:04:44,461 --> 00:04:44,841
it's,

187
00:04:44,841 --> 00:04:45,650
it's perfect.

188
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:45,870
Yeah.

189
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,450
So you find like where the scar
tissue is actually break it up.

190
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:49,991
Exactly.

191
00:04:49,991 --> 00:04:53,350
The surface area on the
quantum is obviously smaller
so it goes even deeper and,

192
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,100
and uh,

193
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,270
and unlocks that muscle real quick.

194
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:55,961
So for me,

195
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:57,340
I don't have the time for foam rolling.

196
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:57,581
You know,

197
00:04:57,581 --> 00:04:59,360
that's the main reason why I,

198
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:02,740
I wanted a product like this cause foam
rolling takes forever to break to really

199
00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:05,140
loosen up a muscle and
I'm in the gym all day.

200
00:05:05,141 --> 00:05:08,380
Do I want to stay in the gym another
hour rolling up and down on a,

201
00:05:08,381 --> 00:05:09,214
on a foam roller.

202
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,630
I think you got to do something though,

203
00:05:10,631 --> 00:05:10,960
right?

204
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,231
Yeah,

205
00:05:11,231 --> 00:05:11,681
exactly.

206
00:05:11,681 --> 00:05:12,580
Kind of have to do something.

207
00:05:12,581 --> 00:05:14,560
If you're training hard and
you want to train for life,

208
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,000
do you use those?

209
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:16,440
What?

210
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,440
We don't have one in the room,

211
00:05:17,441 --> 00:05:18,430
but the reason those,

212
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:19,264
um,

213
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,700
what are they calling supernova?

214
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,990
Look a little cross bog balls,

215
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,740
but it's larger and it's
like a big blue one.

216
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:27,551
I love that thing.

217
00:05:27,551 --> 00:05:28,570
It's rogue makes it,

218
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,040
that fucker gets in there,

219
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,170
but this is even better than that.

220
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:33,730
This thing is incredible.

221
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,920
I like the ball for my back.

222
00:05:35,921 --> 00:05:36,730
When I do my back,

223
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:37,870
I feel like in light down on it,

224
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:38,950
I can get the pressure I want,

225
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,640
but when I use,

226
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,900
when I do my legs,

227
00:05:40,901 --> 00:05:41,734
I used the Tim time.

228
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,341
Yeah.

229
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:43,240
When I go on the road,

230
00:05:43,241 --> 00:05:46,480
I bring that ball with me and I'll put
it on the ground in a hotel room and I

231
00:05:46,481 --> 00:05:51,370
bridge on it just like hit like certain
spots to amazing pop everything loose

232
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,720
and you need a lot of body weight.

233
00:05:52,721 --> 00:05:56,830
Sometimes I put a kettle bell on
my chest and you get even deeper.

234
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:57,680
Mm.

235
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,040
And

236
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,873
uh,

237
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,740
you could really unlock
a muscle like this.

238
00:06:00,741 --> 00:06:00,981
I mean,

239
00:06:00,981 --> 00:06:03,700
it could really get in there and
really unlock it for people who train.

240
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,071
They know,

241
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:04,500
you know when you,

242
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,220
what'd you get out of that nagging tight
muscle in your neck and your shoulder,

243
00:06:07,221 --> 00:06:08,054
your shoulder blades.

244
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:08,540
Yeah.

245
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,171
And then you're on the mat.

246
00:06:09,171 --> 00:06:10,040
You do a quick movement,

247
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,113
you know,

248
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,080
that's scary.

249
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:16,070
So I did it once in the shower or it's
something going on in my neck or gas and

250
00:06:16,071 --> 00:06:19,310
I didn't realize how bad it was and I
turned the shower to get something and

251
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,640
then for like days I was locked up.

252
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:23,690
I've had that done also,

253
00:06:23,691 --> 00:06:24,320
but it's,

254
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,120
it's all about keeping the muscles loose.

255
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,750
Yeah.

256
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,530
Good posture.

257
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:27,771
You know,

258
00:06:27,771 --> 00:06:28,700
Kelly started wrote a book,

259
00:06:28,701 --> 00:06:29,700
you had him on on the show.

260
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,740
He's really amazing guy.

261
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:31,220
He's great.

262
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,270
He really changed my life.

263
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:32,690
Honestly.

264
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:32,960
I have to,

265
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,870
I'm thinking of reading his book,

266
00:06:33,871 --> 00:06:34,521
supple Leopard.

267
00:06:34,521 --> 00:06:35,270
I know all my,

268
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:35,810
all,

269
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,610
everybody who knows me follows me.

270
00:06:37,611 --> 00:06:37,851
They know.

271
00:06:37,851 --> 00:06:38,810
I always talk about this book,

272
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:39,471
you know,

273
00:06:39,471 --> 00:06:40,850
he said something so important.

274
00:06:40,851 --> 00:06:41,121
He said,

275
00:06:41,121 --> 00:06:41,271
look,

276
00:06:41,271 --> 00:06:42,380
it comes down to two things.

277
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,530
Good alignment and loose muscles.

278
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,310
You got to keep your body
aligned and loose muscles and a,

279
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,490
I just followed those two principles.

280
00:06:49,491 --> 00:06:49,661
I mean,

281
00:06:49,661 --> 00:06:50,331
his book is really,

282
00:06:50,331 --> 00:06:51,164
really excellent.

283
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,810
And when I saw his,

284
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,591
when I read his book,

285
00:06:54,591 --> 00:06:57,950
that's when I reached out to him
to work with George because he,

286
00:06:57,951 --> 00:06:58,700
I don't know if you've ever seen,

287
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,770
when George does a back flip and he lands,

288
00:07:00,771 --> 00:07:00,921
he's,

289
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,960
and he's always kind of come in together.

290
00:07:02,961 --> 00:07:05,120
If you ever see like watch him
do a backflip that's called the,

291
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:07,590
I was reading his book and I
saw that's the vulgus fault.

292
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,960
He calls that the Volk
is fault when you're,

293
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:10,130
when you do a squat in your knees,

294
00:07:10,131 --> 00:07:11,180
come close to one another.

295
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,081
And he's like,

296
00:07:12,081 --> 00:07:13,520
that took him cause ACL tears.

297
00:07:13,521 --> 00:07:14,060
And I'm like,

298
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,460
I know a guy with two ACL tears
and he does that all the time.

299
00:07:16,461 --> 00:07:17,750
I see him do that all the time.

300
00:07:17,751 --> 00:07:19,430
It's something I've always
noticed about George.

301
00:07:19,431 --> 00:07:20,330
He's knees always bow.

302
00:07:20,331 --> 00:07:21,230
And when we do lifts,

303
00:07:21,231 --> 00:07:21,981
when we do jumps,

304
00:07:21,981 --> 00:07:22,814
when we do hurdles,

305
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:23,421
I mean,

306
00:07:23,421 --> 00:07:24,010
I've watched Jay,

307
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:28,640
Georgia jumped up and done literally
thousands of times and I saw his knees

308
00:07:28,641 --> 00:07:29,870
battling all the time and he's like,

309
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:30,620
well,

310
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,520
then I reached out to him.

311
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:31,911
I said,

312
00:07:31,911 --> 00:07:32,061
hey,

313
00:07:32,061 --> 00:07:33,350
could you help me correct Georges?

314
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:33,861
There it is.

315
00:07:33,861 --> 00:07:34,290
That's the vault,

316
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:35,123
his fault.

317
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:35,601
And he's like,

318
00:07:35,601 --> 00:07:35,920
sure.

319
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,060
And ever since then,

320
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:41,150
Georgia needs it had been a lot
better and we still do to fix it.

321
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,230
Well what he does,

322
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,460
it's a technical skill.

323
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:44,691
It's a skill.

324
00:07:44,691 --> 00:07:45,171
So he does,

325
00:07:45,171 --> 00:07:46,970
he has a few different exercises
to help you correct it.

326
00:07:46,971 --> 00:07:49,490
So you put a band around your knees
and you kind of push out on the band.

327
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:53,180
But really what we do is we'll make
Georgia do a lift or a jump film it,

328
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:56,930
send it to Kelly and he'll tell us how
aligned we are and what directions to go.

329
00:07:56,931 --> 00:07:59,240
So he kind of coaches us on how to avoid,

330
00:07:59,270 --> 00:07:59,910
uh,

331
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:00,590
um,

332
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:01,071
this,

333
00:08:01,071 --> 00:08:01,280
uh,

334
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:01,640
fault.

335
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,420
However it really,

336
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,021
at the end of the day,

337
00:08:03,021 --> 00:08:05,090
it's about keeping your
knees turn to the outside.

338
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,900
I used to walk up the stairs and
have needs in my pain in my knee.

339
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,090
You ever have that when you walk upstairs?

340
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:11,540
No.

341
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,450
I used to have pain in my knee walking
up the stairs and that was from stairs

342
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,310
just from walking upstairs
and I didn't know why.

343
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,390
And then when I read
his book and he's like,

344
00:08:17,391 --> 00:08:17,541
look,

345
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:18,440
when you walk up a step,

346
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,630
you got to keep your toes straight
to and turn your knee out.

347
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:21,531
I was like,

348
00:08:21,531 --> 00:08:22,364
really?

349
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,810
And I started doing that.

350
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,160
My pain was gone immediately.

351
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,760
Keep your toe straight,

352
00:08:26,761 --> 00:08:27,010
right?

353
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:29,270
Like toes turn your knee out,

354
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,140
turn you need to the outside.

355
00:08:30,141 --> 00:08:30,501
So he says,

356
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:31,160
look,

357
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:31,670
this is your,

358
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:32,503
this is your ACL.

359
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,023
See this year,

360
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:35,871
this is your ACL.

361
00:08:35,871 --> 00:08:36,950
Cross your ECL,

362
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:38,211
ECL,

363
00:08:38,211 --> 00:08:39,050
you put it in your kneecap,

364
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,313
that's your knee.

365
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:41,750
When you turn your knee to the outside,

366
00:08:41,751 --> 00:08:41,991
look at,

367
00:08:41,991 --> 00:08:42,824
tightens it up.

368
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,810
That takes away all the slack.

369
00:08:44,811 --> 00:08:46,490
So what happens when you're going up the,

370
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,720
when you're going up the stairs,

371
00:08:47,721 --> 00:08:47,841
your,

372
00:08:47,841 --> 00:08:48,081
your,

373
00:08:48,081 --> 00:08:48,740
your,

374
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,200
your ACL is just jiggling
around and getting sheered.

375
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,150
When when you tighten it up,

376
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:54,530
you go up,

377
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:55,363
you're secured.

378
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:58,230
So he calls it creating
Torque is a brilliant book.

379
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,063
Mine is brilliant guy.

380
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,900
So even when you run hills,

381
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:01,620
you should do that.

382
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,131
Absolutely.

383
00:09:02,131 --> 00:09:02,970
You should always be a,

384
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,100
whenever your body is
under pressure or stress,

385
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,870
whether you're wrestling or whatnot,

386
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,670
you should always have torque.

387
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:09,631
So like,

388
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:09,811
look,

389
00:09:09,811 --> 00:09:10,680
grab your shirt like this.

390
00:09:10,681 --> 00:09:10,861
Okay,

391
00:09:10,861 --> 00:09:11,440
grab your shirt.

392
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:11,771
Okay,

393
00:09:11,771 --> 00:09:13,050
he gives an example in the book.

394
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,830
Excellent example.

395
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,810
So now grab the shirt and twist it here.

396
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,830
Create torque.

397
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:17,663
Now look,

398
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,340
you have a much more uh,

399
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,041
stable grip.

400
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:20,261
You know,

401
00:09:20,261 --> 00:09:22,530
like a judoka is always going to
grab the lapels and twist them.

402
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:23,790
So when you grab the bar,

403
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:23,960
let's,

404
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,840
you're going to do a bench press.

405
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:25,680
Maybe you know,

406
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,850
it's not the best exercise or not,

407
00:09:26,851 --> 00:09:29,040
but the principles still at work,

408
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,361
when you got the bar,

409
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,940
you should be torquing the bomb most.

410
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,410
When you're doing pushups,

411
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,320
your hands are on the mat and you're
torquing even though your hands are not

412
00:09:37,321 --> 00:09:37,651
turning,

413
00:09:37,651 --> 00:09:38,640
literally you just torquing.

414
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:39,601
When you do that,

415
00:09:39,601 --> 00:09:41,130
you feel that all the slack is eaten up,

416
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:42,721
there's no more slack,

417
00:09:42,721 --> 00:09:45,210
there's no more a trampoline effect.

418
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:45,361
You know,

419
00:09:45,361 --> 00:09:46,111
there's no more jiggling.

420
00:09:46,111 --> 00:09:46,681
Everything's tight,

421
00:09:46,681 --> 00:09:48,600
the system is tight and it's very,

422
00:09:48,601 --> 00:09:51,450
very important that the system be tight
and then the weight beyond the muscles.

423
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,490
So if you're properly aligned,

424
00:09:53,491 --> 00:09:54,390
when you're doing a maneuver,

425
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,880
the weight is on the bone,

426
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,670
not on attendance.

427
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,391
So if you put your,

428
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:01,920
put your weight like this on your fingers,

429
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,440
you'll see that the bone
is carrying the word.

430
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,130
If you bent,

431
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,180
if you bend your bones here,

432
00:10:06,181 --> 00:10:06,381
look at,

433
00:10:06,381 --> 00:10:06,511
look,

434
00:10:06,511 --> 00:10:07,980
if you're on the line and
you start putting pressure,

435
00:10:07,981 --> 00:10:08,230
nice,

436
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,630
your muscles are starting
to work overtime.

437
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,210
So when I'm carrying weight,

438
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:12,600
I need to,

439
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,030
I need to have it on my
bones and or my muscles,

440
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,800
never on the tendons and ligaments,

441
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:17,070
you know,

442
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,660
they can then share with backpackers,

443
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,651
backpackers,

444
00:10:19,651 --> 00:10:20,441
do they,

445
00:10:20,441 --> 00:10:20,880
they,

446
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,990
they keep their legs as stiff
as possible and they take short,

447
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,610
like sort of short steps.

448
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:28,710
Like guys who are mountain near guys,

449
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,500
they don't take like big high steps.

450
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:34,950
They kind of keep their legs stiff
and they walk with their skeleton,

451
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:35,310
right?

452
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,480
If trying to let their scale and see me,

453
00:10:36,481 --> 00:10:37,500
I'm sitting on this chair,

454
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,640
this chair has no muscles,

455
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,690
but it's holding me up because
of the structure structures,

456
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,320
that type of,

457
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:43,890
of uh,

458
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:44,441
strength.

459
00:10:44,441 --> 00:10:44,561
Though.

460
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,350
If you take an egg and you try
to squeeze it in a certain way,

461
00:10:46,351 --> 00:10:46,951
you can't break it.

462
00:10:46,951 --> 00:10:47,131
You know,

463
00:10:47,131 --> 00:10:48,150
you ever seen that experiment?

464
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:48,811
Why?

465
00:10:48,811 --> 00:10:51,870
Because you're actually trying to
crush a cylinder to crush a sinner.

466
00:10:51,871 --> 00:10:53,310
That takes a tremendous amount of force.

467
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:53,641
However,

468
00:10:53,641 --> 00:10:55,830
to break a stick and half takes
very little amount of force.

469
00:10:55,831 --> 00:10:56,520
Why?

470
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,353
And has a lot to do with the,

471
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,141
with the structure.

472
00:10:58,141 --> 00:11:01,140
If you're trying to
compress manner on itself,

473
00:11:01,141 --> 00:11:01,501
it won't,

474
00:11:01,501 --> 00:11:01,860
it won't.

475
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,690
It take a tremendous
amount of force to do that.

476
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:04,763
Tremendous,

477
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,330
tremendous amount of power.

478
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:07,321
However,

479
00:11:07,321 --> 00:11:11,880
if you want to separate the material
by bending it at the middle,

480
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:12,481
it very easy.

481
00:11:12,481 --> 00:11:13,350
But to compress it,

482
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,090
to compress material on itself,

483
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:15,430
it takes,

484
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:16,740
would take a tremendous amount of energy.

485
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,770
So anytime you're going
outside of your alignment,

486
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,600
you're allowing things to compress.

487
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:21,780
Yeah.

488
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,630
That's why it makes so much sense to keep
your leg straight when you're hiking.

489
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,291
It's like a horse.

490
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:25,861
It sleeps right?

491
00:11:25,861 --> 00:11:26,694
He's sleeping.

492
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,710
If he aligns his legs perfectly straight,

493
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,370
he's using structure to hold him
up instead of muscular strength.

494
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,181
So,

495
00:11:33,181 --> 00:11:33,481
I mean,

496
00:11:33,481 --> 00:11:33,810
and he,

497
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:34,520
I remember he had,

498
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,020
you had them on the show and you
guys had a very interesting uh,

499
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:37,933
uh,

500
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:41,940
conversation and he was talking about
front squatting will make you have a great

501
00:11:41,941 --> 00:11:42,360
guard.

502
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,940
But I think you guys miss misunderstood
each other actually cause you were like,

503
00:11:44,941 --> 00:11:45,271
no,

504
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:46,380
France squatting has
nothing to do with it.

505
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:47,280
Have a great garden.

506
00:11:47,281 --> 00:11:47,351
I,

507
00:11:47,351 --> 00:11:48,390
and I agree with both of you,

508
00:11:48,391 --> 00:11:49,224
but I think you guys,

509
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,380
we're not talking about the exact same
thing he's talking about having the

510
00:11:52,381 --> 00:11:53,214
mobility

511
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,650
to squat down really
low and the front squat,

512
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:59,950
we'll help you regard not
necessarily having a big lift,

513
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,060
but not necessarily,

514
00:12:01,061 --> 00:12:02,200
he wasn't talking about heavy lifting.

515
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:05,050
300 pounds in the front squat is gonna
make you a great guard player that that's

516
00:12:05,051 --> 00:12:05,884
irrelevant.

517
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,250
I think what he was talking about is
having credible and mobility in your hips.

518
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:13,330
You ever see a child pick up something
off the floor like a newborn baby?

519
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:14,890
He's going to get into this perfect,

520
00:12:14,891 --> 00:12:15,700
perfect squat.

521
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:15,881
Well,

522
00:12:15,881 --> 00:12:16,091
if you,

523
00:12:16,091 --> 00:12:17,140
if you look at guard players,

524
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:20,110
the best guard players always have
incredible flexibility in their hips,

525
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:20,740
right?

526
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,110
Because I always tell people that the
higher you can bring your hips to your

527
00:12:23,111 --> 00:12:23,944
chest,

528
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,510
the hardest for me to pass your guard.

529
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:26,680
Like if you're one of those guys were,

530
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:27,790
were your knees like this,

531
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:27,971
you know,

532
00:12:27,971 --> 00:12:29,410
you're trying to regard
and you need it this far.

533
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,780
It's the space for me to
pass your guard is huge.

534
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,500
Yeah.

535
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,260
But if you can bring this foot
behind your head and your hymns,

536
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,370
it's the window.

537
00:12:36,371 --> 00:12:40,000
The space that I need to cross to
get to side control is so small.

538
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:40,990
Um,

539
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:41,823
Eddie has a,

540
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:42,791
excuse me,

541
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:43,421
one of his students,

542
00:12:43,421 --> 00:12:46,560
his name's Sean Ballinger
and he has crazy [inaudible].

543
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,081
I've seen him,

544
00:12:47,081 --> 00:12:48,650
I've seen the double a.

545
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,290
He could do double lotus and literally
take his legs and put them behind his

546
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:53,550
head.

547
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:53,830
Yeah.

548
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,630
I mean he could just
pull those lines back.

549
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,260
How many,

550
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,180
how many great guard players
have you seen who can do that?

551
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,790
Swearing like Ryan Hall for instance.

552
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:01,570
Yeah.

553
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:02,021
Keenan,

554
00:13:02,021 --> 00:13:04,060
I mean they have this flexibility to them.

555
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,920
Passing the guards becomes very,

556
00:13:05,921 --> 00:13:06,110
very,

557
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:06,881
it's almost impossible.

558
00:13:06,881 --> 00:13:07,481
Almost impossible.

559
00:13:07,481 --> 00:13:10,350
It's like they just spend a little bit
and you're back in something again and

560
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:10,530
you're,

561
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:13,840
you're tying up and then you in leg
locks and you're kind of fucked anxieties

562
00:13:13,841 --> 00:13:16,370
there as they're spinning to your leg
while you're trying to pass their guard.

563
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:21,390
And hip flexibility is so paramount
in Jujitsu for bottom game especially.

564
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,180
And it's so devastating
when you have a hip injury,

565
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:26,950
hip injuries and you know,

566
00:13:26,951 --> 00:13:29,320
I know guys who have had hip
replacements and it's like,

567
00:13:29,321 --> 00:13:30,154
boy,

568
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:30,490
you know,

569
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:31,051
then you're,

570
00:13:31,051 --> 00:13:34,210
you're so severely limited in
what you can do afterwards.

571
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,590
You got to never let it get there.

572
00:13:35,591 --> 00:13:36,424
In my opinion,

573
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:37,181
according to Kelly,

574
00:13:37,181 --> 00:13:39,880
he says your joints can
last you a 120 years.

575
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,110
Like if you take care of them.

576
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,120
He said there's 2% catastrophe,

577
00:13:43,121 --> 00:13:44,800
meaning you got hit by a bus.

578
00:13:44,801 --> 00:13:44,981
Okay,

579
00:13:44,981 --> 00:13:45,820
that's something we can,

580
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:46,720
we can't do anything about.

581
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,840
98% of the time is because you
didn't take care of your joints,

582
00:13:49,841 --> 00:13:50,260
you haven't,

583
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:55,260
you haven't properly use them and you
let muscles get tight for too long over a

584
00:13:55,271 --> 00:13:56,021
long period of time.

585
00:13:56,021 --> 00:13:56,771
So for me personally,

586
00:13:56,771 --> 00:13:57,940
I feel like when I was 20,

587
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,550
I feel better now than when I was 25.

588
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,121
He's at 25.

589
00:14:01,121 --> 00:14:02,470
I was really beat up 26,

590
00:14:02,471 --> 00:14:02,981
27.

591
00:14:02,981 --> 00:14:03,814
I was really like,

592
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,541
hey my knees,

593
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:04,961
my back,

594
00:14:04,961 --> 00:14:05,471
my neck,

595
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:05,621
you know,

596
00:14:05,621 --> 00:14:06,220
training everyday.

597
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,420
Twice a day it was grueling.

598
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,580
But after I went through that system,

599
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:13,120
I came back out fresh and now whenever
I have a little tweak or anything like

600
00:14:13,121 --> 00:14:13,331
that,

601
00:14:13,331 --> 00:14:14,500
I take care of it immediately.

602
00:14:14,501 --> 00:14:15,070
I kill it.

603
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,740
I don't let any tweak creep up,

604
00:14:16,741 --> 00:14:19,270
Go Gore he further and uh,

605
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,950
I feel much more energy.

606
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:21,461
Like when I,

607
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:22,450
when I keep that,

608
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,620
the body healthier Louis,

609
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:24,670
I feel a lot more energy.

610
00:14:24,671 --> 00:14:25,360
I feel better.

611
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,260
My mood is better.

612
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:26,921
That's the,

613
00:14:26,921 --> 00:14:30,580
it's the balance between being tough and,

614
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:31,271
and you know,

615
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:34,030
being mentally strong enough to like
push through training when you're,

616
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:34,570
you know,

617
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:38,170
you're not feeling your best and knowing
that you're fucking up your vehicle

618
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:40,120
when you're knowing that
you're fucking up your body.

619
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,983
Very true.

620
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:41,411
Very true.

621
00:14:41,411 --> 00:14:45,340
There's a balance hard for fighters in
particular because they want to be tough,

622
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:45,881
you know?

623
00:14:45,881 --> 00:14:48,520
So you've got some weird little
thing in new leg or whatever.

624
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:50,160
I'm just going to work
through it and just were,

625
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:50,501
and you say,

626
00:14:50,501 --> 00:14:51,930
I'm just going to like that,

627
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:52,910
which is hilarious.

628
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:54,200
People who say they're going to go,

629
00:14:54,201 --> 00:14:57,630
like you go light and then you get tagged
and then you want to get some of that

630
00:14:57,631 --> 00:14:59,240
and the next thing you know
you're not going light.

631
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,040
And then that thing and your leg,

632
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,150
it's all fucked up.

633
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,020
And then next thing you know,

634
00:15:03,021 --> 00:15:05,290
you go to a doctor and
know you have an MCL tear.

635
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:05,810
Ah,

636
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:06,643
fuck.

637
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:07,660
Yup.

638
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,230
And then what that tightness that's,

639
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:10,340
it gets worse after,

640
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:11,210
after 48 hours,

641
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:12,044
you have dlms,

642
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,370
delayed onset muscle soreness,

643
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,181
and then you're in the shower,

644
00:15:14,181 --> 00:15:15,014
you turn your neck,

645
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:15,321
boom,

646
00:15:15,321 --> 00:15:16,100
something pops.

647
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:16,600
Yeah,

648
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,300
yeah.

649
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:21,560
What do you do in terms of
dictates or Cunanan or cocoon.

650
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,280
Cocoon.

651
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:22,791
That's how you say it,

652
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:23,000
right?

653
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,020
Kirk Koonin,

654
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:24,973
Tumeric,

655
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:26,810
anti-inflammatory,

656
00:15:26,811 --> 00:15:27,110
you know,

657
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,370
herbs and things along those lines.

658
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:29,541
I know that,

659
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:30,140
um,

660
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:30,861
there was Rhonda,

661
00:15:30,861 --> 00:15:32,840
Patrick just put something up about,

662
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,733
uh,

663
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:34,760
I think you see,

664
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,660
I think you called curcumin
circling or Kirk Kirk Cunanan.

665
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,280
Anyway,

666
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,020
it's Tumeric.

667
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:45,170
It's the active ingredient in tumeric
and she just puts something up on her,

668
00:15:45,171 --> 00:15:50,150
a Twitter page a couple of days ago
about how important this stuff is and to

669
00:15:50,151 --> 00:15:51,890
make sure that you have a bioavailable,

670
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,900
improves memory and mood as well.

671
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:54,441
Well,

672
00:15:54,441 --> 00:15:54,971
I'll have to try it.

673
00:15:54,971 --> 00:15:55,580
I haven't tried it.

674
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:55,971
Yeah,

675
00:15:55,971 --> 00:15:57,080
it's just to Merrick.

676
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:57,780
It's uh,

677
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,251
and yeah,

678
00:15:58,251 --> 00:16:01,100
and that stuff is
fantastic for inflammation.

679
00:16:01,101 --> 00:16:03,380
People that have soreness and you know,

680
00:16:03,381 --> 00:16:06,710
like nagging injuries
and nagging inflammation,

681
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,500
having that as a part of
your daily diet is fantastic.

682
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,940
Along with fish oil.

683
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,010
Fish oil is really good for that,

684
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,091
you know,

685
00:16:14,091 --> 00:16:14,421
of course.

686
00:16:14,421 --> 00:16:18,380
And then watching your diet and making
sure you're low and inflammatory foods

687
00:16:18,381 --> 00:16:23,150
like sugar and alcohol and really it's
amazing how much of a difference it

688
00:16:23,151 --> 00:16:23,570
makes.

689
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:27,290
Huge if you have any sort of
a back injury or inflammation.

690
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:30,680
I talked to this lady who was a therapist
a few years back and she was saying,

691
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:31,371
you know,

692
00:16:31,371 --> 00:16:34,520
you should really try going gluten
free if you have issues with your,

693
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:34,820
uh,

694
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,421
with your back.

695
00:16:35,421 --> 00:16:35,721
I was like,

696
00:16:35,721 --> 00:16:36,060
listen,

697
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,040
this wacky pitch,

698
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,660
that's what I was thinking.

699
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,000
All those things.

700
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,281
It's like,

701
00:16:40,281 --> 00:16:40,431
oh,

702
00:16:40,431 --> 00:16:41,520
she's talking woo woo,

703
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,280
Woo Crystal's nonsense.

704
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:44,451
And I was like,

705
00:16:44,451 --> 00:16:44,960
wait a minute.

706
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,381
Really?

707
00:16:45,381 --> 00:16:46,130
Gluten.

708
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:46,491
She's like,

709
00:16:46,491 --> 00:16:48,320
you'd be amazed at how many people,

710
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:48,950
um,

711
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:49,301
when,

712
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:53,780
and now that I've thought about
it more and with all I know,

713
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:57,650
talking to various nutritionists
and actual clinical researchers,

714
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:01,760
I think it's as much gluten
as it is just just sugar,

715
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:05,540
refined carbohydrate hydrates and refined
carbohydrates and sugars and all these

716
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:06,050
different things.

717
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:07,130
Just create inflammation.

718
00:17:07,131 --> 00:17:08,210
There's just no way around it.

719
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,330
Especially the,

720
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:12,770
the levels that normal
Americans eat a man.

721
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,753
Oh boy.

722
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,030
Yeah.

723
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,440
You're talking about where the worst,

724
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:15,940
yeah,

725
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,320
it's,

726
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,660
it's tremendous amount of sugar.

727
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,420
Yeah.

728
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:23,330
You don't know it until you get off sugar
and then you go see everybody who is

729
00:17:23,331 --> 00:17:26,450
eating the standard amount
of sugar and you're like,

730
00:17:26,451 --> 00:17:27,284
it blows your mind.

731
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:27,540
Yeah.

732
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,580
You don't need that much sugar.

733
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:29,620
Still Way does it.

734
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:30,680
It's just way too much.

735
00:17:30,681 --> 00:17:32,300
And you'll feel sick eating
that much sugar again.

736
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:32,961
Like it's just,

737
00:17:32,961 --> 00:17:33,680
it's mind boggling.

738
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,000
Like a Jug Gatorade,

739
00:17:35,001 --> 00:17:36,730
the love doing drink after practice.

740
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:37,603
I didn't get that down.

741
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,380
I mean if you ever seen those,

742
00:17:39,381 --> 00:17:43,030
they have those things where
they show you a in I'm on uh,

743
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:43,641
online.

744
00:17:43,641 --> 00:17:46,430
They have like this is the amount
of sugar that's in a can of coke.

745
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:50,310
This is the amount of sugar
that's in a 24 bottle of Gatorade.

746
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:51,740
It's fucking crazy.

747
00:17:51,741 --> 00:17:53,700
It's incredible amount of pile is sugar.

748
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:54,450
It's unbelievable.

749
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,040
It's like a fist full of sugar,

750
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:56,963
but it's addictive.

751
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:57,620
Yeah.

752
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,500
Customer coming back.

753
00:17:59,280 --> 00:17:59,620
Yes.

754
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,450
The customer coming back.

755
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,410
You need that next sugar high.

756
00:18:01,411 --> 00:18:04,710
You need a more sugar than next time
around and you need another dose of sugar

757
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:05,911
and I think,

758
00:18:05,911 --> 00:18:06,351
I think you should,

759
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:07,990
you should get it from
whole foods mostly in.

760
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,570
It gets released in your system naturally.

761
00:18:09,571 --> 00:18:10,404
Slowly.

762
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,370
There it is right there.

763
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,031
Look at that.

764
00:18:12,031 --> 00:18:12,864
Wow.

765
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,733
Wow.

766
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,850
Big Gulp is like a,

767
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,380
it's like a key low.

768
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:17,021
Wow.

769
00:18:17,021 --> 00:18:17,760
It's like,

770
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,710
like you bringing coke across the border.

771
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,760
That's just poisonous.

772
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,980
Fucking amazing.

773
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:25,760
That's so much a girl.

774
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:26,723
That's impressive.

775
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:27,931
What does it say?

776
00:18:27,931 --> 00:18:29,040
17 grams.

777
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:29,790
What does it say,

778
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:30,181
Jamie?

779
00:18:30,181 --> 00:18:31,260
30 17 table.

780
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,240
1732 tables for that.

781
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,400
This is 18 tables.

782
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:36,750
See Jesus Christ.

783
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,673
Wow.

784
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,490
It's so much sugar.

785
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,460
Some milk.

786
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,090
Wow.

787
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,160
Chocolate milk's supposed to
be good after you train though.

788
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:47,850
White milk to,

789
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:47,960
well,

790
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,110
maybe that's old news.

791
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:49,610
Uh,

792
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:50,280
I dunno,

793
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,300
George used to do that.

794
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:51,601
Yeah.

795
00:18:51,601 --> 00:18:52,434
George used to that.

796
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,251
But I'll tell you something.

797
00:18:53,251 --> 00:18:54,900
George is a freak of nature
when it comes to diet.

798
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:55,800
Yeah.

799
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:55,981
He,

800
00:18:55,981 --> 00:18:56,820
he's very blessed.

801
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:57,401
Okay.

802
00:18:57,401 --> 00:18:57,781
I think,

803
00:18:57,781 --> 00:18:58,290
uh,

804
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:58,770
I think this,

805
00:18:58,770 --> 00:18:59,041
look,

806
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,030
this is just my observation,

807
00:19:00,031 --> 00:19:01,020
but I think some people,

808
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:02,203
um,

809
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,261
when they eat carbs,

810
00:19:03,261 --> 00:19:04,190
they spike the insulin.

811
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:04,681
Okay.

812
00:19:04,681 --> 00:19:06,840
And they can get fat off
if they eat too much carbs.

813
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:10,230
And some people will eat a tremendous
amount of carbs and they never get fat.

814
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,191
And we've all had,

815
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,170
we all have a friend
who eats a lot of junk.

816
00:19:13,171 --> 00:19:14,190
Food is ripped.

817
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:15,800
They're not,

818
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,680
they're not many in the,

819
00:19:16,681 --> 00:19:17,340
in the world.

820
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:17,581
Okay.

821
00:19:17,581 --> 00:19:18,414
But they exist.

822
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:18,961
You've all,

823
00:19:18,961 --> 00:19:20,250
we've all met a person like that.

824
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,600
Georgia is one of those guys.

825
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,570
Like if he eats Mcdonald's for a week
or he eats vegetables for a week,

826
00:19:24,571 --> 00:19:25,051
it doesn't matter.

827
00:19:25,051 --> 00:19:26,070
He's going to be lean either way.

828
00:19:26,071 --> 00:19:27,480
Now he'd be leaner on vegetables.

829
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,740
But even on Mcdonald's,

830
00:19:28,741 --> 00:19:29,551
he's going to be lean.

831
00:19:29,551 --> 00:19:32,880
He's never been fat and his entire career,

832
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,691
his entire life,

833
00:19:33,691 --> 00:19:36,090
I should say so I mean
get a little heavier.

834
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:37,320
When he stopped training it look,

835
00:19:37,321 --> 00:19:39,330
cause he took some photos for the UFC.

836
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:40,710
He looked a little heavier.

837
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,401
Bulky,

838
00:19:41,401 --> 00:19:42,234
I would say.

839
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,590
Would you say that he's Chubby?

840
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,150
No,

841
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:44,340
no,

842
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:44,930
no.

843
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:45,810
I saw him at the beach.

844
00:19:45,811 --> 00:19:47,290
I wouldn't say we like
this guy's shredded,

845
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,001
that guys,

846
00:19:48,001 --> 00:19:48,301
Jack,

847
00:19:48,301 --> 00:19:48,751
Jack Guys,

848
00:19:48,751 --> 00:19:49,051
Jack.

849
00:19:49,051 --> 00:19:49,441
They show it.

850
00:19:49,441 --> 00:19:50,101
It's George.

851
00:19:50,101 --> 00:19:52,050
You hold them to the highest of standards.

852
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,040
You know,

853
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,270
if I hate the way he eats,

854
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,020
I would be fat.

855
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:55,261
Why?

856
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:56,094
Let's put it that way.

857
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,180
How many people told me,

858
00:19:57,181 --> 00:19:57,331
hey,

859
00:19:57,331 --> 00:19:58,500
I had been hanging out
with George for a week.

860
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:58,981
I got fat,

861
00:19:58,981 --> 00:19:59,551
I gained 10 pounds.

862
00:19:59,551 --> 00:19:59,761
I'm like,

863
00:19:59,761 --> 00:20:00,061
yeah,

864
00:20:00,061 --> 00:20:00,894
that's George Man.

865
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,031
That's George.

866
00:20:02,031 --> 00:20:02,280
You don't,

867
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,180
don't eat like he eats.

868
00:20:03,181 --> 00:20:03,660
You won't.

869
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,200
It won't work.

870
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,840
And he has his whole theories and
philosophies all about why he's leaving.

871
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:07,291
It's like,

872
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:07,471
dude,

873
00:20:07,471 --> 00:20:07,621
no,

874
00:20:07,621 --> 00:20:08,070
you're just,

875
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,010
you're just born this way.

876
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:09,850
[inaudible] this doesn't get it.

877
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:10,530
I've like,

878
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:11,670
I've trained thousands of people.

879
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:12,061
Okay.

880
00:20:12,061 --> 00:20:14,190
He's trained himself
like he thinks that way.

881
00:20:14,191 --> 00:20:14,400
He went,

882
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,030
he did.

883
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,280
What he did is we're going
to work for everyone.

884
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:19,320
And I love Georgia Super Intelligent Guy,

885
00:20:19,321 --> 00:20:20,670
but I tell him during the week,

886
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,880
like he's very gifted when it comes to
food and he does a lot of things and like

887
00:20:23,881 --> 00:20:26,190
now he's doing a lot of fasting
and he's getting even leaner,

888
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:29,520
but it would be a long
time for Georgia's fat.

889
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:30,181
Do you see that there's,

890
00:20:30,181 --> 00:20:30,450
there's,

891
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:31,680
there's various body types.

892
00:20:31,681 --> 00:20:31,861
You know,

893
00:20:31,861 --> 00:20:34,740
you do have ectomorph
Mesomorph endomorph and we're,

894
00:20:34,741 --> 00:20:35,340
we're uh,

895
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:38,990
we're on the continuum of these
three is on the Ectomorph side and a,

896
00:20:38,991 --> 00:20:39,271
in a,

897
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:44,271
in a strong sign of ectomorph is a small
waist and George has a Mesomorph no

898
00:20:44,391 --> 00:20:46,230
mesomorph cause he's very muscular.

899
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:46,801
He is.

900
00:20:46,801 --> 00:20:47,140
I would,

901
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:47,811
you become more active,

902
00:20:47,811 --> 00:20:48,190
more Schwab

903
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:48,800
muscles,

904
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,860
but sorry.

905
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:50,000
Yeah,

906
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,833
go ahead.

907
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:53,830
George was very skinny and
scrawny when he was young,

908
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,290
so he went crazy on the weights.

909
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,030
He turned his weakness into a strength.

910
00:20:58,031 --> 00:20:58,091
He,

911
00:20:58,091 --> 00:20:59,110
that's so much weight,

912
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:02,140
weight training and exercise
because he wanted to bulk up.

913
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,630
So he's a bulk ectomorph now.

914
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:05,500
He's not a perfect outcome.

915
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,170
He's not 100% up to more of,

916
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,860
I would say it's between
Ectomorph Mesomorph,

917
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,600
endomorph the,

918
00:21:10,601 --> 00:21:11,740
the other end of the spectrum.

919
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,770
You eat a little bit of a
carbohydrate to get fat,

920
00:21:14,771 --> 00:21:15,820
you lift a little bit of muscles,

921
00:21:15,821 --> 00:21:17,600
your muscles explode in size.

922
00:21:17,601 --> 00:21:18,490
The George wasn't like that.

923
00:21:18,491 --> 00:21:20,260
Georgia is a bit on the
other side of the spectrum.

924
00:21:20,261 --> 00:21:23,980
So a real mesomorph would
be like Melvin Manhoef.

925
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,241
Uh,

926
00:21:25,241 --> 00:21:25,511
yeah.

927
00:21:25,511 --> 00:21:25,901
Like that,

928
00:21:25,901 --> 00:21:26,734
you know,

929
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,030
I think I'm kind of no,

930
00:21:28,031 --> 00:21:28,101
no,

931
00:21:28,101 --> 00:21:28,141
no,

932
00:21:28,141 --> 00:21:28,974
no.

933
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,060
That's more uh,

934
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:30,580
uh,

935
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,710
endomorph endomorph it's fat.

936
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:33,371
Yeah.

937
00:21:33,371 --> 00:21:35,730
But you could also be
very muscular and morph.

938
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:35,981
Yeah.

939
00:21:35,981 --> 00:21:36,761
You can be very muscular.

940
00:21:36,761 --> 00:21:38,140
I thought endomorph is like,

941
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:42,160
like people that have a really
hard time not being overweight.

942
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:45,610
You can gain fat and muscle
really quickly as an endomorph.

943
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:45,850
Yeah.

944
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:47,320
But ectomorphs from what I've read,

945
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,213
I might be wrong.

946
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,440
Neither one of us are biologists.

947
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,673
Exactly.

948
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:52,730
Exactly.

949
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,370
I always thought Ectomorph
is really skinny.

950
00:21:54,371 --> 00:21:58,100
Endomorph was they tend to lean towards
being overweight and then Mesomorph for

951
00:21:58,101 --> 00:22:00,490
someone who's like really
like a Francis and Ghana,

952
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,580
not super ma or Brock
Lesnar like super muscular,

953
00:22:03,581 --> 00:22:04,414
thick,

954
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:07,900
like just look like they like
naturally would pack a lot of mosques.

955
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,800
I'm sure you could pull up a chart if you,

956
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,710
if you can't,

957
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:12,460
all these pictures just show
both of them from what I,

958
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:13,220
from what I've read,

959
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:13,900
see them as amorphous,

960
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,740
kind of in the middle.

961
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:18,520
ECTOMORPH is Ilene and hot pack on muscle.

962
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:22,510
Ectomorph looks like a skinny dork and
Mesomorph looks like he's super jacked

963
00:22:22,511 --> 00:22:23,770
and endomorph looks like,

964
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,830
well endomorph endomorph does
not look fat in that picture.

965
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,870
He doesn't have to be fat.

966
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,560
That's the thing.

967
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,040
Now here,

968
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:30,390
here's,

969
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,540
let me tell you something ladies.

970
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,370
When you look at those three pictures,

971
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,390
I go with endomorph all day.

972
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:36,191
Exactly.

973
00:22:36,191 --> 00:22:37,240
Those three pictures,

974
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,940
if that's what an endomorph is,

975
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:40,950
let's take that in the morning.

976
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,170
Yeah.

977
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:45,280
Because they need a lot of
naps and they're always tired.

978
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,160
And those mesomorphs their egos,

979
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:47,950
Mike,

980
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:48,790
they want to choke you.

981
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:50,740
The mesomorph shoulders you
want to fucking strangle you.

982
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:51,421
But,

983
00:22:51,421 --> 00:22:51,910
uh,

984
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,260
endomorphs that's a woman.

985
00:22:53,261 --> 00:22:53,590
God,

986
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:56,050
you can have a rift endomorph
anybody can be ripped.

987
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,270
That's the guy's an endomorph.

988
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,480
Maybe think about it in
the morph is like a short,

989
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:02,440
stocky hulk.

990
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:03,970
I should be fat.

991
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:05,950
And he could also be packed with muscle,

992
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,750
like the Calvin Kelvin gassed alum,

993
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:08,311
Kevin Gasol.

994
00:23:08,311 --> 00:23:10,660
And he would only put them on the
end of the moves and the more site.

995
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:10,961
Yes,

996
00:23:10,961 --> 00:23:11,530
definitely.

997
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:16,210
Because he's never really totally ripped
while dolce when he had him and he was

998
00:23:16,211 --> 00:23:18,730
getting them down to a real one 70,

999
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:19,551
he,

1000
00:23:19,551 --> 00:23:20,371
he really had,

1001
00:23:20,371 --> 00:23:21,850
I'm pretty ripped at one point in time.

1002
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,080
Just really low body.

1003
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:23,980
You can get ripped.

1004
00:23:23,981 --> 00:23:25,270
It's just not as easy to get there.

1005
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,130
Anybody can get ripped.

1006
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,450
But uh,

1007
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,380
an ectomorph.

1008
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,120
So think about a basketball player.

1009
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:31,691
Okay.

1010
00:23:31,691 --> 00:23:34,840
One of the signs they say is small waist.

1011
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,960
The waist and shoulders are quite similar.

1012
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:38,140
Now George has a v going,

1013
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:38,361
you know,

1014
00:23:38,361 --> 00:23:39,460
is very broad shoulders,

1015
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:40,270
which is great.

1016
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:44,110
He's perfectly built for fighting that
allows him for reach and his Aa cause

1017
00:23:44,111 --> 00:23:45,030
he's got incredible like this.

1018
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,100
He's wearing shoulder pads

1019
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:46,933
almost.

1020
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:47,631
And you know,

1021
00:23:47,631 --> 00:23:48,620
he's blessed with many,

1022
00:23:48,621 --> 00:23:49,000
many,

1023
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:49,610
uh,

1024
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:50,060
uh,

1025
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,350
genetic gifts for fighting,

1026
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:52,243
no doubt about it.

1027
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,670
And endomorphs are naturally predisposed,

1028
00:23:54,671 --> 00:23:55,310
excuse me.

1029
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:58,250
ECTOMORPHS are naturally
predisposed to endurance sports.

1030
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,530
So you'll see a lot of
marathon runners or whatnot.

1031
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:01,610
They're tall and lanky.

1032
00:24:01,611 --> 00:24:02,241
They're not short,

1033
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:03,074
bulky,

1034
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:04,220
you know,

1035
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,740
Mike Tyson type look athletes.

1036
00:24:06,741 --> 00:24:07,574
That's a real,

1037
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:08,270
that's a real,

1038
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:08,990
that's what I would say.

1039
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:11,120
Endomorph endomorph because he's so short,

1040
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:13,550
short and stocky and bulky.

1041
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:15,040
He could put on a lot of muscle,

1042
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:15,960
a lot of fat Nasco.

1043
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:16,843
Is he a little bit,

1044
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:17,391
I don't want to,

1045
00:24:17,391 --> 00:24:18,470
I don't want to say he's fat,

1046
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:18,911
whether he's,

1047
00:24:18,911 --> 00:24:21,260
he's put on some fat since
he's a retired or whatnot.

1048
00:24:21,261 --> 00:24:21,700
Right.

1049
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,230
I don't know how much
it works out anymore,

1050
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:23,481
you know?

1051
00:24:23,481 --> 00:24:23,991
Exactly.

1052
00:24:23,991 --> 00:24:24,830
But an Ectomorph,

1053
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,180
even when they stop working out,

1054
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:27,140
they're still,

1055
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,980
they're less likely to put pack on fat.

1056
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,260
And I have a little belly,

1057
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:30,531
you know,

1058
00:24:30,531 --> 00:24:32,750
but it's not as as pronounced.

1059
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:36,260
It's not as pronounced as an endomorph
and more full pack on fat and muscle real

1060
00:24:36,261 --> 00:24:37,094
quickly.

1061
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,151
And they're,

1062
00:24:38,151 --> 00:24:38,984
they're more,

1063
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:39,770
they're more,

1064
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:40,460
um,

1065
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:43,490
they gravitate more towards
power sports so they can explode,

1066
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:44,420
but we'll have less.

1067
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,260
They have less cardio.

1068
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,660
Where's the ECTOMORPH is like,

1069
00:24:47,661 --> 00:24:48,650
you'll see a lot of running backs.

1070
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,131
They're short,

1071
00:24:49,131 --> 00:24:49,820
stocky,

1072
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,481
and the morph,

1073
00:24:50,481 --> 00:24:50,930
man,

1074
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:51,890
they have to explode for three,

1075
00:24:51,891 --> 00:24:52,370
four seconds.

1076
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:55,650
Is there a best body for
fighting or is there a,

1077
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:59,450
do you just adapt your style
to whatever body you exactly.

1078
00:24:59,451 --> 00:25:01,760
I think there's the best
body for basketball.

1079
00:25:01,761 --> 00:25:02,950
The best body for football.

1080
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,430
While it depends on what
position you're playing,

1081
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,750
but fighting,

1082
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:08,690
everybody has an a fight in their DNA.

1083
00:25:08,691 --> 00:25:10,220
So all styles,

1084
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:11,211
excuse me,

1085
00:25:11,211 --> 00:25:12,830
all body types can fight.

1086
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:14,120
And that's what's so amazing.

1087
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:14,391
You got it.

1088
00:25:14,391 --> 00:25:15,141
You got to Paul Harris.

1089
00:25:15,141 --> 00:25:16,700
He's an endomorph man,

1090
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,670
but he found a way to fight
that make sense for him.

1091
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,720
That's what I always tell people.

1092
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:23,090
You got to fight according to your,

1093
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:24,441
your body type.

1094
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:25,310
And people think that's crazy.

1095
00:25:25,311 --> 00:25:25,610
No,

1096
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:28,700
Muhammad Ali fought a certain way
because it has certain attributes.

1097
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:30,320
He had certain,

1098
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,150
he had certain,

1099
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:31,441
uh,

1100
00:25:31,441 --> 00:25:32,330
a certain personality.

1101
00:25:32,331 --> 00:25:33,740
Even your personalities are important.

1102
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,570
If he tried to fight Mike Tyson,

1103
00:25:35,571 --> 00:25:36,350
it would backfire.

1104
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:38,150
If Tyson tried to fight like Muhammad Ali,

1105
00:25:38,151 --> 00:25:39,020
it would backfire.

1106
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,020
I think everybody has to start with
the basics and then after three,

1107
00:25:42,021 --> 00:25:42,980
four years of training,

1108
00:25:42,981 --> 00:25:45,290
even maybe up to five years now,

1109
00:25:45,291 --> 00:25:47,870
you got a specialized for
what your temperament is,

1110
00:25:47,871 --> 00:25:49,190
what's your body type is,

1111
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,960
what your personality is.

1112
00:25:50,961 --> 00:25:55,160
Because not everybody wants to get it
done and run one and not everybody's the

1113
00:25:55,161 --> 00:25:58,430
type of person who's going to take it to
the cards and not everybody has a reach

1114
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:00,060
and speed to jab in and out.

1115
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:00,560
Luckily we think,

1116
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:00,651
oh,

1117
00:26:00,651 --> 00:26:02,050
I'm just going to jab in
and out like I'll eat.

1118
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:02,251
Do it.

1119
00:26:02,251 --> 00:26:04,070
Do you have the attributes that Ali has?

1120
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:08,570
He was born with certain attributes and
everybody's born with an attribute for

1121
00:26:08,571 --> 00:26:08,980
fighting.

1122
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:09,813
In my opinion,

1123
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,990
everybody got this far
because they can fight.

1124
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:13,670
Nobody got here,

1125
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:14,360
uh,

1126
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,120
this far without having some
innate ability to fight,

1127
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,193
to defend themselves.

1128
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:21,950
So all our body types
can defend themselves,

1129
00:26:21,951 --> 00:26:24,650
but you have to discover what
works best for that body type.

1130
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:26,720
Would Tyson is a perfect example.

1131
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:27,321
Exactly.

1132
00:26:27,321 --> 00:26:30,020
They thought you couldn't make it in the
pools if I'd always going to get killed

1133
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:30,740
in the pros bright.

1134
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:31,850
There's never been a short guy.

1135
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,560
When when Ali was dancing around,

1136
00:26:33,561 --> 00:26:33,891
people are like,

1137
00:26:33,891 --> 00:26:34,130
no,

1138
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:34,851
that's not going to work.

1139
00:26:34,851 --> 00:26:38,570
He's going to get tired and he goes to
the heavyweights heavyweight shouldn't

1140
00:26:38,571 --> 00:26:41,000
bounce around and at least to
spar a lot with lightweights,

1141
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,830
he sparse six rounds with light weights,

1142
00:26:42,831 --> 00:26:43,820
then six rounds with a heavyweight.

1143
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:44,070
Why?

1144
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,280
Because he would play
tag with a lightweight.

1145
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:47,790
It just about speed and movement.

1146
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,710
You move twice as much
with the lightweight.

1147
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,390
What is your thoughts on on hard sparring?

1148
00:26:52,391 --> 00:26:55,410
Because when you see the
ties in the way they spar,

1149
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,273
there's some,

1150
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,900
there's a great benefit in that.

1151
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:00,880
I mean there's a great benefit in
that barely hitting each other shit.

1152
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:01,510
I do that.

1153
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:02,610
I do tremendous amount of that.

1154
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:03,691
You know,

1155
00:27:03,691 --> 00:27:04,710
one thing when people spar with me,

1156
00:27:04,711 --> 00:27:04,981
they're like,

1157
00:27:04,981 --> 00:27:05,191
man,

1158
00:27:05,191 --> 00:27:05,461
you move.

1159
00:27:05,461 --> 00:27:06,294
So like,

1160
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:06,841
you know,

1161
00:27:06,841 --> 00:27:07,201
people are like,

1162
00:27:07,201 --> 00:27:08,580
it's so seamless the way you move.

1163
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:09,540
And I,

1164
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,490
I do thousands of hours of live rolling,

1165
00:27:11,491 --> 00:27:12,000
inspiring,

1166
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,020
but a lot of those hours,

1167
00:27:13,021 --> 00:27:16,800
I would say 80% of them is very
light because I know the terrain.

1168
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:20,520
I just want to go through the sequences
as many times as I can and when I'm

1169
00:27:20,521 --> 00:27:20,941
really,

1170
00:27:20,941 --> 00:27:21,774
really warmed up,

1171
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,450
then I'll go heart in all start talking
smack a bit in the gym and I'm like,

1172
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:25,771
oh my,

1173
00:27:25,771 --> 00:27:26,780
let's see what you got and I'll,

1174
00:27:26,781 --> 00:27:27,150
I'll,

1175
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:30,540
I'll tell the guy when it's time to go
really hard and we're having fun with it.

1176
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:30,721
You know?

1177
00:27:30,721 --> 00:27:30,991
For me,

1178
00:27:30,991 --> 00:27:31,920
having fun is really,

1179
00:27:31,921 --> 00:27:32,754
really important.

1180
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:34,710
Now that's training for longevity,

1181
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,700
but if you have a fight,

1182
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:37,650
I think you need to do six
weeks of hard sparring.

1183
00:27:37,651 --> 00:27:38,460
Why?

1184
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:42,090
Because the speed of the
fight is very particular.

1185
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:43,650
We need to get to fight speed,

1186
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:47,160
the actual speed of the fight because
you might get caught sleeping if you,

1187
00:27:47,161 --> 00:27:48,840
if you haven't done that now,

1188
00:27:48,841 --> 00:27:51,150
if you have a tremendous
amount of fight experience,

1189
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:52,680
you don't need the less of that.

1190
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:52,981
So,

1191
00:27:52,981 --> 00:27:53,341
for instance,

1192
00:27:53,341 --> 00:27:55,200
a tie who has been fighting
since he's eight years old.

1193
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:58,110
He can tune up just on
the path and go fight.

1194
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:00,840
Why he's been doing it
since the day he can.

1195
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:01,620
He can walk,

1196
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:01,831
you know,

1197
00:28:01,831 --> 00:28:03,540
almost like you look at a Mayweather.

1198
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,630
I can get me with already
with just a little Mitt work,

1199
00:28:06,631 --> 00:28:07,081
put them in there.

1200
00:28:07,081 --> 00:28:08,070
He's going to be at a world champion.

1201
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:08,510
Why?

1202
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:08,840
It's,

1203
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,020
it's hardwired.

1204
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,850
If you look at a baby's brain,

1205
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,720
the baby's brain is not
wrinkled like a heat,

1206
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:14,700
like an adult's brain.

1207
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:17,040
It's wrinkled to us of small degree.

1208
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:19,080
As he goes through his experiences,

1209
00:28:19,081 --> 00:28:20,550
especially in the first
three years of his life,

1210
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:24,330
his brain literally gets hardwired
and wrinkled and it gets less and less

1211
00:28:24,331 --> 00:28:29,331
wrinkled over time and when you're
hardwired to do something you,

1212
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:33,410
the likelihood of you
needing to tune up is,

1213
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:33,721
it's very,

1214
00:28:33,721 --> 00:28:34,351
it's very minimal.

1215
00:28:34,351 --> 00:28:34,650
Like,

1216
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:35,041
for instance,

1217
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:36,720
I remember looking at the
biography of me whether,

1218
00:28:36,721 --> 00:28:39,150
and he was saying when he would
go to picnics with his family,

1219
00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:40,750
his father would bring
boxing gloves and he,

1220
00:28:40,751 --> 00:28:41,880
his box with his cousins.

1221
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:44,520
They literally will be
punching each other's for him.

1222
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:45,310
You know,

1223
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:45,970
he's,

1224
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,400
he's been doing it so long.

1225
00:28:47,401 --> 00:28:48,480
The more experienced you are,

1226
00:28:48,481 --> 00:28:49,650
the less hard sparring you need.

1227
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:53,010
The more seasoned you are,

1228
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,270
the less hard sparring you need.

1229
00:28:54,271 --> 00:28:55,260
You know what fighting is.

1230
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:56,790
You just need a little tuneup at the end.

1231
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,020
So if you look at Georgia,

1232
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:58,320
Georgia,

1233
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,153
great example,

1234
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:02,490
he's super skilled and he's super healthy.

1235
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:04,560
Some guys get to the high skill level,

1236
00:29:04,561 --> 00:29:05,640
but they're broken up.

1237
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,080
Their body's broken,

1238
00:29:07,081 --> 00:29:07,920
their knees broken.

1239
00:29:07,921 --> 00:29:08,490
They can barely,

1240
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:09,090
I barely have three,

1241
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:09,960
four fights left in them,

1242
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:10,950
right?

1243
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:11,970
Do you want to get really,

1244
00:29:11,971 --> 00:29:13,350
really good and then be broken?

1245
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:13,621
What you,

1246
00:29:13,621 --> 00:29:14,430
when you got there,

1247
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,031
you finally,

1248
00:29:15,031 --> 00:29:15,271
you know,

1249
00:29:15,271 --> 00:29:17,040
you've been cultivating
these skills for 15 years.

1250
00:29:17,041 --> 00:29:17,874
You get there,

1251
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,940
you get those skills that you want it all.

1252
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:20,521
I can't use them.

1253
00:29:20,521 --> 00:29:20,880
Why am I,

1254
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,720
the machine is broken.

1255
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,101
You know,

1256
00:29:23,101 --> 00:29:23,550
I'm,

1257
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,383
I'm 38.

1258
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:25,970
I feel like I,

1259
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:26,803
when I was 20,

1260
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,211
uh,

1261
00:29:27,211 --> 00:29:30,660
personally because I spar 80% of my
sparring is very flow and relaxed.

1262
00:29:30,661 --> 00:29:31,500
Like I use a lot of,

1263
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,910
I train a lot with purple belts,

1264
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:33,681
Bluebell Zinpro belts.

1265
00:29:33,681 --> 00:29:33,860
Why?

1266
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,220
Because they kind of
hurt me if they tried,

1267
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:37,290
I just toy with them till I'm warmed up,

1268
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:38,761
I'm flowing.

1269
00:29:38,761 --> 00:29:39,481
I'm not really working,

1270
00:29:39,481 --> 00:29:40,081
harms flowing,

1271
00:29:40,081 --> 00:29:41,190
I'm just doing my combinations.

1272
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,130
And

1273
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:43,930
then when I really want
to have a good challenge,

1274
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,400
I'll take one of the most elite guys,

1275
00:29:45,401 --> 00:29:47,350
one of my pros and I'll do
one or two rounds with them.

1276
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:47,621
You know,

1277
00:29:47,621 --> 00:29:49,150
I won't burn my machine out.

1278
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:49,770
You know,

1279
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:51,880
like imagine driving your car
and the red line all the time.

1280
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,103
Yeah.

1281
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,970
Now that's a great way of looking at it.

1282
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,570
When you,

1283
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:57,400
when you guys get ready for a fight,

1284
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:59,290
like say if you get
George ready for a fight,

1285
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:04,620
how much time do you spend on working
on his recovery from the workouts?

1286
00:30:04,661 --> 00:30:05,350
Like,

1287
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:09,760
like how do you bust out the Tim
Tam Machine and ice things down?

1288
00:30:09,761 --> 00:30:13,770
Like how aware of you or are
you guys have like do you have,

1289
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:17,770
I guess a regimented program of
how to recover from exercise?

1290
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:19,300
Recovery is everything.

1291
00:30:19,301 --> 00:30:19,831
So it's,

1292
00:30:19,831 --> 00:30:23,530
it's stress plus recovery
equals adaptation.

1293
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,460
Stress Plus Stress Equals
d training and an injury.

1294
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,210
Yeah,

1295
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:29,110
a good trainer,

1296
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:30,303
a good trainer.

1297
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,080
He understands super compensation rate.

1298
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:32,561
You have stress,

1299
00:30:32,561 --> 00:30:33,400
you have recovery,

1300
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:37,240
and then you have a new
level of skill or ability.

1301
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,790
If you don't go through
the recovery phase,

1302
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:43,840
you will not reap the rewards of your
training or has to be a recovery phase.

1303
00:30:43,841 --> 00:30:47,140
Not every athlete has a level
of recovery that they can,

1304
00:30:47,141 --> 00:30:47,591
they can achieve.

1305
00:30:47,591 --> 00:30:48,310
So as you get,

1306
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,840
as you get more experience as an athlete,

1307
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,280
your body can can,

1308
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,270
as you become,

1309
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,230
uh,

1310
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:53,800
as you're,

1311
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,210
as you're more and more fit,

1312
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,103
I should say,

1313
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:58,120
your body can recover for more stress.

1314
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:01,540
So I have to gauge how
good mice my student is.

1315
00:31:01,541 --> 00:31:03,370
It has to be challenging but manageable.

1316
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,170
If I make it too challenging,

1317
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:05,921
I'm red lining him.

1318
00:31:05,921 --> 00:31:06,754
He's going to break,

1319
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,110
he's and he's going to pop.

1320
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:09,550
He's going to be unmotivated.

1321
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:11,050
If it's too easy,

1322
00:31:11,051 --> 00:31:11,884
it's going to be bored.

1323
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,200
I have to find the right
amount of stimulus.

1324
00:31:14,201 --> 00:31:15,490
So when I'm in the practice room,

1325
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:18,010
if I see Georgia just mauling
guys and destroying them,

1326
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:18,903
I have to make it,

1327
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:20,890
I have to scale the workout
so that it's harder,

1328
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:24,940
but I don't want to scale it so high is
that I injure him and break him or that

1329
00:31:24,941 --> 00:31:28,720
he made out of practice by a hair and now
he's not motivated to do another camp.

1330
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:29,771
You know,

1331
00:31:29,771 --> 00:31:29,971
we,

1332
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:34,570
we reached those high intensity levels
periodically throughout the year and they

1333
00:31:34,571 --> 00:31:36,550
have to be done in a
certain way that it's fun.

1334
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,181
Like you know,

1335
00:31:37,181 --> 00:31:38,014
George was like,

1336
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:39,400
he was on your show and he was saying,

1337
00:31:39,401 --> 00:31:40,570
I'll try to kill them in the practice room

1338
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:42,610
now.

1339
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:43,031
It's true.

1340
00:31:43,031 --> 00:31:43,660
He's right.

1341
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,370
But I do it so rarely.

1342
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,520
I do so periodically and I make it a joke.

1343
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:51,130
That's why like what he was trying to
say is that I brought in the guys in the

1344
00:31:51,131 --> 00:31:53,500
room and I was watching
him spar with Georgia.

1345
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:54,580
They don't want to touch his face.

1346
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:55,870
This is when he was like a mega star,

1347
00:31:55,871 --> 00:31:56,890
like he was the champion.

1348
00:31:56,891 --> 00:31:58,570
Nobody wants to try to double leg him.

1349
00:31:58,571 --> 00:32:00,640
Nobody wants to try to hurt
him because they're like,

1350
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:04,450
I'm not going to come here in
his house and tried to show him.

1351
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,470
There's a respect thing.

1352
00:32:05,471 --> 00:32:06,190
There's a,

1353
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:06,521
there's a,

1354
00:32:06,521 --> 00:32:07,480
there's starstruck,

1355
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:07,751
you know,

1356
00:32:07,751 --> 00:32:09,130
these young kids salad,

1357
00:32:09,131 --> 00:32:09,964
bring them in.

1358
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:10,361
And I'd be like,

1359
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:11,194
listen guys,

1360
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,220
I'll give a speech.

1361
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:13,930
The first guy to double leg,

1362
00:32:13,931 --> 00:32:15,160
I'm the first guy to put 'em out.

1363
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:18,040
I would put like a $5,000 reward,

1364
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:18,880
uh,

1365
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,260
I think knock him out and the hurt,

1366
00:32:20,261 --> 00:32:21,041
if you've knocked George,

1367
00:32:21,041 --> 00:32:22,270
I'll give you 5,000 bucks.

1368
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,130
And she leaves for George on his back.

1369
00:32:24,131 --> 00:32:25,300
If you put George on his back,

1370
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,501
if you take them down,

1371
00:32:26,501 --> 00:32:27,280
put them on his back,

1372
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,970
I'll stop the whole practice and praise
you for 20 minutes in front of everybody

1373
00:32:30,971 --> 00:32:31,330
in the gym.

1374
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:31,420
And,

1375
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:31,610
and,

1376
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:31,811
and,

1377
00:32:31,811 --> 00:32:33,670
and students don't get
praised by me very often.

1378
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:35,110
So George would be like,

1379
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:36,603
oh my God,

1380
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,210
these guys,

1381
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:37,871
they're coming after me.

1382
00:32:37,871 --> 00:32:38,710
And he would get riled up.

1383
00:32:38,711 --> 00:32:39,830
And I will do this periodically.

1384
00:32:39,831 --> 00:32:40,251
Rarely,

1385
00:32:40,251 --> 00:32:40,461
right?

1386
00:32:40,461 --> 00:32:40,591
We're,

1387
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:40,741
we're,

1388
00:32:40,741 --> 00:32:41,990
we're talking about world class,

1389
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:42,920
world title fight,

1390
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:43,131
you know,

1391
00:32:43,131 --> 00:32:43,964
the stuff's on the line.

1392
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:49,100
And I need these guys to actually show
me where is missing something because

1393
00:32:49,101 --> 00:32:51,410
then when you have this perfect
practice and you win all the time,

1394
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:52,731
what do you work on?

1395
00:32:52,731 --> 00:32:53,091
Well,

1396
00:32:53,091 --> 00:32:53,924
nothing went wrong.

1397
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:54,950
There's nothing to fix.

1398
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:55,791
So I mean,

1399
00:32:55,791 --> 00:32:58,070
there are times where we really red light.

1400
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:01,160
Have you ever had anybody knock him
out and practice and take that money?

1401
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:05,180
Now he's been dropped once
in practice pretty badly.

1402
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,790
And it's a funny story,

1403
00:33:07,791 --> 00:33:09,410
but the money wasn't
on the line that time.

1404
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,970
There was no price for that.

1405
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,830
One time he got dropped
in practice and um,

1406
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:15,910
I want it to stop.

1407
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:16,850
I want to pull the plug.

1408
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,560
It was for a world title fight.

1409
00:33:18,561 --> 00:33:20,690
He was fighting that hardy
two weeks before his fight.

1410
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:22,940
I was sure he was concussed.

1411
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:24,021
And I said,

1412
00:33:24,021 --> 00:33:24,231
George,

1413
00:33:24,231 --> 00:33:25,064
I'm pulling the,

1414
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:25,560
the,

1415
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,720
the round one more round.

1416
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:27,620
He said to me,

1417
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,010
coach,

1418
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:28,761
let me finish the round.

1419
00:33:28,761 --> 00:33:29,300
I'm okay.

1420
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,620
Let me finish the next round.

1421
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:33,230
And I felt that if I pulled him,

1422
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,580
I would have killed his confidence.

1423
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:36,470
I would have killed his confidence.

1424
00:33:36,471 --> 00:33:36,801
Totally.

1425
00:33:36,801 --> 00:33:37,431
So I said,

1426
00:33:37,431 --> 00:33:38,090
okay,

1427
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:38,960
you could do the next round.

1428
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,551
And I told the other guy,

1429
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:42,260
he was sparring with
Dolan line a single glove.

1430
00:33:42,261 --> 00:33:43,010
Like I whispered to him,

1431
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:44,210
not a single glove on it,

1432
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:48,530
just take a mauling and George went in
the next round not knowing that the other

1433
00:33:48,531 --> 00:33:49,640
guy is not allowed to hit him at all.

1434
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,640
He just crushes the guy.

1435
00:33:52,641 --> 00:33:52,881
Right.

1436
00:33:52,881 --> 00:33:55,100
He's just like mauls him and
gets that and I was really,

1437
00:33:55,101 --> 00:33:56,090
really grateful for that.

1438
00:33:56,091 --> 00:33:56,421
That guy,

1439
00:33:56,421 --> 00:33:57,570
that guy was a pro and it was very,

1440
00:33:57,571 --> 00:34:02,120
very grateful that he took the beating
that we asked them to write and I'm

1441
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:02,960
joined.

1442
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,441
You have to was like,

1443
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:03,711
man,

1444
00:34:03,711 --> 00:34:04,191
I know,

1445
00:34:04,191 --> 00:34:06,860
I know it went bad and round
four but Ron five was amazing.

1446
00:34:06,861 --> 00:34:07,401
I was on fire.

1447
00:34:07,401 --> 00:34:07,820
North acid.

1448
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:08,653
You weren't.

1449
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:10,000
You were,

1450
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,760
you were.

1451
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,840
I think sneaky shit.

1452
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:12,913
He's like,

1453
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:13,991
I have.

1454
00:34:13,991 --> 00:34:14,101
I,

1455
00:34:14,101 --> 00:34:14,750
wow.

1456
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:15,850
That was brought forward was not,

1457
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:16,730
it was just a fluke.

1458
00:34:16,731 --> 00:34:16,881
You know,

1459
00:34:16,881 --> 00:34:17,241
like this,

1460
00:34:17,241 --> 00:34:17,511
this is,

1461
00:34:17,511 --> 00:34:19,520
this is what I'm going
to look like around five,

1462
00:34:19,521 --> 00:34:19,701
you know,

1463
00:34:19,701 --> 00:34:19,930
I'm like,

1464
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:20,361
yeah.

1465
00:34:20,361 --> 00:34:21,170
He's like,

1466
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:21,681
it's a good thing.

1467
00:34:21,681 --> 00:34:22,131
It's Friday,

1468
00:34:22,131 --> 00:34:22,311
you know,

1469
00:34:22,311 --> 00:34:23,300
because I have the day off tomorrow.

1470
00:34:23,301 --> 00:34:23,900
I'm like George,

1471
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:24,733
today's Saturday.

1472
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:26,090
It's like wow.

1473
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:26,640
He was shocked.

1474
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:26,981
He was like,

1475
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:27,560
did he Saturday?

1476
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:27,741
I'm like,

1477
00:34:27,741 --> 00:34:27,891
yeah.

1478
00:34:27,891 --> 00:34:28,160
And,

1479
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:28,601
and the,

1480
00:34:28,601 --> 00:34:29,810
the UFC was there filming

1481
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,031
so I had to like,

1482
00:34:32,031 --> 00:34:32,421
look guys,

1483
00:34:32,421 --> 00:34:33,500
that footage can never air,

1484
00:34:33,501 --> 00:34:33,681
you know,

1485
00:34:33,681 --> 00:34:34,940
that foot has got to disappear.

1486
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:35,451
You know?

1487
00:34:35,451 --> 00:34:35,691
They're like,

1488
00:34:35,691 --> 00:34:35,871
yeah,

1489
00:34:35,871 --> 00:34:36,321
don't worry.

1490
00:34:36,321 --> 00:34:36,530
No,

1491
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:37,840
we understand the fights on the line.

1492
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:39,830
He was fighting Darren
hardy two weeks later.

1493
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:40,880
That's why that fight,

1494
00:34:40,881 --> 00:34:43,880
he was doing a lot of wrestling cause
we didn't want to like even chance.

1495
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,860
I was sure he had a concussion
when he went in that fight.

1496
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:48,710
Now pulling the plug on that fight
on a lot of people would be like,

1497
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:48,891
hey,

1498
00:34:48,891 --> 00:34:49,370
you put his leg,

1499
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:50,210
you put his health on the line.

1500
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:50,960
You're right.

1501
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,590
But it's so much pressure.

1502
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:52,911
First of all,

1503
00:34:52,911 --> 00:34:53,710
George didn't want,

1504
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:54,590
that has nothing to do with UFC.

1505
00:34:54,591 --> 00:34:55,580
We kept it from UFC.

1506
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,721
Like we told them,

1507
00:34:56,721 --> 00:34:56,870
like,

1508
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:57,651
we told the camera guys,

1509
00:34:57,651 --> 00:34:59,090
Barry this like,

1510
00:34:59,091 --> 00:34:59,920
don't report it.

1511
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,800
Like George would never want to,

1512
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:02,723
uh,

1513
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:03,891
back out of that fight.

1514
00:35:03,891 --> 00:35:04,701
It was two weeks from now.

1515
00:35:04,701 --> 00:35:06,870
Everybody's coming to watch
us fight like this despite,

1516
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:07,131
you know,

1517
00:35:07,131 --> 00:35:07,700
it's been,

1518
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,780
it's been on the,

1519
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,793
uh,

1520
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:10,360
what do you call it?

1521
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,030
The prime time.

1522
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:11,960
It's been like three weeks.

1523
00:35:11,961 --> 00:35:12,441
They're filming,

1524
00:35:12,441 --> 00:35:12,621
you know,

1525
00:35:12,621 --> 00:35:13,430
like this is happening,

1526
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:14,780
this fight is happening no matter what.

1527
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:15,021
You know,

1528
00:35:15,021 --> 00:35:16,130
the Georges in that mindset.

1529
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:17,570
And uh,

1530
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:18,920
but he went in there honestly like,

1531
00:35:18,921 --> 00:35:19,430
uh,

1532
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:19,641
you know,

1533
00:35:19,641 --> 00:35:20,870
after he got dropped pretty badly.

1534
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,130
Wow.

1535
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:22,550
Yeah.

1536
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,000
That's,

1537
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,600
you know,

1538
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,350
Forrest Griffin got knocked out twice
before his fight with Anderson Silva man

1539
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:28,603
twice.

1540
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:31,370
And apparently one of them was real bad.

1541
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,090
Really?

1542
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:32,923
Yeah.

1543
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:33,450
Yeah.

1544
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:33,991
It's dangerous.

1545
00:35:33,991 --> 00:35:36,470
I think he was sparring
with Vandelay and uh,

1546
00:35:36,471 --> 00:35:38,130
apparently you don't spar with Vandelay?

1547
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:38,930
No,

1548
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:39,840
it's just fights.

1549
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,130
Yeah.

1550
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:43,080
I mean he's old school shooter box,

1551
00:35:43,081 --> 00:35:44,190
especially back then.

1552
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:45,083
Oh my God.

1553
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:45,331
Yeah.

1554
00:35:45,331 --> 00:35:47,860
Forest won't really talk
about too much cause he,

1555
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:48,060
you know,

1556
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,490
he doesn't want it doesn't want
it to be perceived as an excuse,

1557
00:35:50,491 --> 00:35:52,210
but he,

1558
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:52,800
uh,

1559
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,160
I mean,

1560
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,690
how many times have fighters done that?

1561
00:35:54,691 --> 00:35:54,901
Many,

1562
00:35:54,901 --> 00:35:56,040
many factors has done that.

1563
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:56,520
Countless.

1564
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:56,880
Yeah.

1565
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,610
To the point where like
I just let the fighter,

1566
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:00,300
the site now,

1567
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,000
unless I really feel like it's urgent,

1568
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,730
which is rare that I've actually had to
intervene because at the end of the day,

1569
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:08,640
when are you 100% it's
really rarely happens.

1570
00:36:08,641 --> 00:36:09,474
There's always something.

1571
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,020
Right.

1572
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:14,610
But the thing about getting knocked out
is that if you get knocked out two weeks

1573
00:36:14,611 --> 00:36:15,330
ago,

1574
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:18,060
your odds of getting knocked
out or significantly higher.

1575
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:18,953
I know,

1576
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:19,381
I know.

1577
00:36:19,381 --> 00:36:19,591
Man.

1578
00:36:19,591 --> 00:36:19,831
It's,

1579
00:36:19,831 --> 00:36:20,301
it's,

1580
00:36:20,301 --> 00:36:20,550
it's,

1581
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,180
it's crazy.

1582
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,710
And then Hardy's a really good strike.

1583
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,431
Oh my God.

1584
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,031
That left hook.

1585
00:36:24,031 --> 00:36:24,870
If it would have touched George,

1586
00:36:24,871 --> 00:36:26,160
George will would have
been out like a light.

1587
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,960
He's got a crazy left hook.

1588
00:36:27,961 --> 00:36:29,610
Plus George was hurt two weeks before.

1589
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:30,623
Yeah.

1590
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:32,010
Thank God it worked out well.

1591
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:32,371
Yeah.

1592
00:36:32,371 --> 00:36:32,791
It worked out.

1593
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:33,624
Credit.

1594
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:36,201
Yeah.

1595
00:36:36,201 --> 00:36:39,840
It's a balancing act of being a
trainer is not something that I envy.

1596
00:36:39,841 --> 00:36:39,990
No,

1597
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:40,823
it's tough.

1598
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,300
It's tough because I care for these guys,

1599
00:36:42,301 --> 00:36:42,790
honestly.

1600
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:42,990
Yeah.

1601
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:44,760
They had nothing to do with
the business where the money,

1602
00:36:44,761 --> 00:36:45,594
I couldn't care less.

1603
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,340
I could not care less.

1604
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:49,620
But I know that that guy,

1605
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:50,760
he's on a one way track.

1606
00:36:50,761 --> 00:36:51,780
So if I'm telling him no,

1607
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:56,850
hit the brakes and he's saying we're
going that that break and harmony is gonna

1608
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,250
create a friction and create
a doubt in the fighter.

1609
00:36:59,320 --> 00:36:59,580
Right.

1610
00:36:59,580 --> 00:36:59,760
Know you,

1611
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,600
are you all in?

1612
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,673
Are you all in?

1613
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:02,011
You know,

1614
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:03,240
because if you're not all in,

1615
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:04,620
you're going to scare your fighter.

1616
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:04,950
Right.

1617
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:05,100
There's,

1618
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,420
there's that to consider as well.

1619
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,313
Yeah.

1620
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:08,700
Um,

1621
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:12,000
when you look at the crop
of up and coming talent,

1622
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,570
I mean this is such a crazy time for MMA.

1623
00:37:15,571 --> 00:37:17,220
I think when you look at these new guys,

1624
00:37:17,221 --> 00:37:20,790
like Zack beat is one of my
favorite guys to watch cause he's,

1625
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:25,590
there's these new crop of guys
that can do everything and they're,

1626
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:26,850
they're so high level.

1627
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:27,930
By the time you see them,

1628
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:32,490
like the first fight I saw of
the beat inside the octagon.

1629
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:32,971
You know,

1630
00:37:32,971 --> 00:37:34,800
I've seen him on video before,

1631
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:36,100
but seeing him live you like,

1632
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,500
oh Lee Shit,

1633
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,160
he's amazing,

1634
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,420
but he's not just amazing.

1635
00:37:39,421 --> 00:37:40,770
It's like this is,

1636
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,140
this is this next level.

1637
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,310
Like there's another level,

1638
00:37:44,311 --> 00:37:45,144
like we've seen this,

1639
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,480
these elite fighters and
everyone's great at Jujitsu.

1640
00:37:48,481 --> 00:37:50,190
Everyone's got great takedown defense,

1641
00:37:50,191 --> 00:37:51,780
everyone knows how to strike,

1642
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:54,480
but then you're seeing this new flavor,

1643
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:55,650
there's like this,

1644
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,311
okay,

1645
00:37:56,311 --> 00:37:57,690
the frequencies now higher,

1646
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:02,370
and it just seems to me that it every
year or so there's these new guys that

1647
00:38:02,371 --> 00:38:03,780
jump through and you're going,

1648
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:04,111
okay,

1649
00:38:04,111 --> 00:38:06,720
well now the frequencies quite
a bit higher than it was before.

1650
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:07,980
It's seamless.

1651
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,140
Transitions are more and more seamless,

1652
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:11,303
which is amazing.

1653
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:12,330
Like you're saying,

1654
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:13,440
they're processing it faster.

1655
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:14,363
Yeah.

1656
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,520
As they're doing the takedown,

1657
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:19,830
like Demetrius is flowing into an arm
bar to take down his even finished and

1658
00:38:19,831 --> 00:38:20,071
you're like,

1659
00:38:20,071 --> 00:38:23,060
the next generation is watching
that and they've adopted that now,

1660
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:25,990
so they're going to flow into
a transition into an art.

1661
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:26,250
Like it's,

1662
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:26,940
it's getting,

1663
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,560
it's getting more and more seamless.

1664
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:29,933
They're computers or,

1665
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:30,290
or,

1666
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:32,370
or computing faster
and faster information.

1667
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:34,920
They're thinking what they're
going to do on the ground.

1668
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:35,801
It hits the ground.

1669
00:38:35,801 --> 00:38:35,901
It's,

1670
00:38:35,901 --> 00:38:36,120
it's,

1671
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:36,520
it's,

1672
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,190
it is incredible

1673
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,680
and they know what can be done now.

1674
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,180
They've seen it all possibilities.

1675
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:44,690
So they have this database in their mind
of accomplishments that have already

1676
00:38:44,691 --> 00:38:46,070
been achieved in other fighters.

1677
00:38:46,071 --> 00:38:46,291
Yeah.

1678
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:47,124
He's been awakened.

1679
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:47,781
Yeah.

1680
00:38:47,781 --> 00:38:49,070
It's fucking crazy,

1681
00:38:49,071 --> 00:38:49,700
man.

1682
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:53,330
When you stop and think about when you
first got involved in the sport and then

1683
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,160
look at the level to fighters are at now,

1684
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:59,360
there's not really a commensurate sport
in terms of like modern mainstream

1685
00:38:59,361 --> 00:39:00,170
sports.

1686
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:04,370
Where you've people have achieved
is such an incredibly high level of

1687
00:39:04,371 --> 00:39:08,690
proficiency that's so far exceeds where
it was a decade ago or two decades ago.

1688
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,430
There's really no comparison.

1689
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,900
The growth rate is ridiculous.

1690
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:13,160
It's fucking amazing.

1691
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,700
And I don't think it's a

1692
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:20,870
a coincidence that the growth rate in
this sport is incredible and this is the

1693
00:39:20,871 --> 00:39:24,620
sport that has the most amount of
variables in terms of combat sports,

1694
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,350
the most amount of
variables in terms of what,

1695
00:39:26,351 --> 00:39:27,410
what a fighter can do to you.

1696
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:31,910
There are more ways to win
than any other combat sport,

1697
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:32,360
obviously.

1698
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,050
Yeah,

1699
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:34,250
and that's why I find it.

1700
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:35,150
See,

1701
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,590
the more you limit us an athlete,

1702
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:37,940
the more it's about torque.

1703
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:39,021
So for instance,

1704
00:39:39,021 --> 00:39:39,854
if you look at sprinting,

1705
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:44,210
if I were to race Hussein bolt
and it had all the best trainers,

1706
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:47,600
the best sprint coaches and
Hussein bolt had the most mediocre,

1707
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:51,920
mediocre sprint coaches and we raced
when we were both 20 years old in our

1708
00:39:51,921 --> 00:39:52,754
prime.

1709
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:54,550
Who's going to win you?

1710
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:58,190
I appreciate the that

1711
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,580
the competence.

1712
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:01,630
It's a joke question,

1713
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:01,960
right?

1714
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,130
He's going to win for sure.

1715
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,353
Put us in MMA.

1716
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:05,621
We're the same way.

1717
00:40:05,621 --> 00:40:05,891
Class,

1718
00:40:05,891 --> 00:40:06,281
same height,

1719
00:40:06,281 --> 00:40:07,060
everything's the same.

1720
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:07,841
I have the best coaches.

1721
00:40:07,841 --> 00:40:08,740
He has the worst coaches.

1722
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:10,390
Who's going to win?

1723
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:11,030
You're going to fuck them.

1724
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:15,970
I'm going to kill him because coaching
now is has a greater influence.

1725
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:16,790
Sprinter.

1726
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:18,940
Say Sprint coaches say
we can make you faster.

1727
00:40:18,941 --> 00:40:20,350
We can not make you fast.

1728
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,770
You have to be born fast.

1729
00:40:21,771 --> 00:40:23,450
That we could shave
off a few milliseconds.

1730
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:24,500
Yeah.

1731
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,630
In MMA we can make you,

1732
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:29,030
I could take a regular Joe and
get them all the way up to UFC.

1733
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,260
I can't make him UFC champion.

1734
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,720
I won't say I can make them UFC
champion to be UFC champion.

1735
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:33,560
You need a talent.

1736
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:34,391
Okay,

1737
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:34,671
there's a,

1738
00:40:34,671 --> 00:40:35,030
there's a,

1739
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:40,030
there's a talent there to be in the 1%
but to get you to UFC because there are

1740
00:40:40,071 --> 00:40:41,330
so many possibilities.

1741
00:40:41,331 --> 00:40:43,910
There are so many ways to trick your
opponent are so many ways to turn the

1742
00:40:43,911 --> 00:40:44,744
tables on him.

1743
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:48,890
The torque no longer matters
or torque is less significant.

1744
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:52,580
So if we're talking about football
where I'm only a lot to do these certain

1745
00:40:52,581 --> 00:40:54,890
maneuvers trickeries put to the side,

1746
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,000
you're not allowed to trick me.

1747
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:59,450
But in MMA you're alleged to
trick me any which way you want.

1748
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,800
There are very few little rules,

1749
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:01,933
okay.

1750
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,290
But outside of these,

1751
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:04,280
these uh,

1752
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:05,720
bard rules is Barton maneuvers.

1753
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:07,400
You can trick me any which way you want.

1754
00:41:07,401 --> 00:41:09,770
So what happens is you take
your opponent to amaze you,

1755
00:41:09,771 --> 00:41:12,710
take your opponent into a world
where torque does it matter so much.

1756
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,600
And that's why the more restrictive,

1757
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:14,770
uh,

1758
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:15,501
a sport is,

1759
00:41:15,501 --> 00:41:16,101
let's say for instance,

1760
00:41:16,101 --> 00:41:16,934
boxing.

1761
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,010
Boxing is more restrictive than Moitai.

1762
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,570
So the guys with Torque,

1763
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:21,950
we're going to do better in boxing.

1764
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,950
Then they will necessarily end Moitai
cause in what I can use more trickery.

1765
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:28,610
I can be a little dweeb and
just beat you with clinching.

1766
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:31,070
Or I could beat you with a trick
kick or I could beat you with a back.

1767
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:31,470
A back.

1768
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:32,540
La Friends is a back kick.

1769
00:41:32,541 --> 00:41:34,730
Anybody can generate knockout
power with a backache.

1770
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:35,781
However,

1771
00:41:35,781 --> 00:41:36,860
with a Red Cross or left hook,

1772
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:39,260
not everybody's going to have
that bone crushing power.

1773
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:40,191
However,

1774
00:41:40,191 --> 00:41:41,840
if you teach somebody how
to throw a proper backache,

1775
00:41:41,841 --> 00:41:42,261
which you know,

1776
00:41:42,261 --> 00:41:43,730
cause you've got the
best back in the game,

1777
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:48,530
you could teach a regular Joel in a few
years how did generate knockout power?

1778
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,150
So now he,

1779
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:50,600
he has that element on the table.

1780
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:54,260
So because MMA soul,

1781
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:55,523
um,

1782
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:56,400
uh,

1783
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:56,731
you know,

1784
00:41:56,731 --> 00:42:01,420
there's so few rules we have a greater
environment for the intellect to,

1785
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:01,740
to,

1786
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:02,573
to shine.

1787
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:03,643
Hmm.

1788
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:07,030
You said something wants to one of your
fighters in between rounds and they

1789
00:42:07,031 --> 00:42:07,721
really stood out.

1790
00:42:07,721 --> 00:42:08,081
You said,

1791
00:42:08,081 --> 00:42:12,520
I want you to overwhelm his mind
with possibilities like your,

1792
00:42:12,521 --> 00:42:12,731
your,

1793
00:42:12,731 --> 00:42:14,200
your overwhelming him.

1794
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:17,380
You're making him think about all the
potential variables that are coming his

1795
00:42:17,381 --> 00:42:17,650
way.

1796
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:18,040
Right.

1797
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,450
My Dad has a great way to put it.

1798
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,340
We talk about

1799
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:20,631
to,

1800
00:42:20,631 --> 00:42:21,464
um,

1801
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,433
a variety.

1802
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,690
So everybody's looking for a pattern.

1803
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:25,731
If I do Jab,

1804
00:42:25,731 --> 00:42:25,941
Jab,

1805
00:42:25,941 --> 00:42:26,774
cross,

1806
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:28,400
and I do with before times,

1807
00:42:28,401 --> 00:42:29,870
the fourth time you're going to see it.

1808
00:42:29,871 --> 00:42:30,890
It's going to be slower to you.

1809
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:31,730
Why?

1810
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:33,410
Because your body's
going to your brain is,

1811
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,400
is that again,

1812
00:42:34,401 --> 00:42:35,211
this is all hypothetical.

1813
00:42:35,211 --> 00:42:36,500
This is just my personal experience.

1814
00:42:36,501 --> 00:42:37,970
I'm basing this on my
own personal experience.

1815
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:41,130
When somebody does something to
me a second or third time it,

1816
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,230
I see it personally.

1817
00:42:42,231 --> 00:42:46,760
I feel like I'm perceiving it slower
and I have a window to counter you.

1818
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:47,691
However,

1819
00:42:47,691 --> 00:42:48,640
when I spar with George,

1820
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:49,720
George is a tricky as guy.

1821
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:50,563
I'll tell you why,

1822
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:51,430
because he's,

1823
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:52,610
he has so many tricks.

1824
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:52,800
Yes.

1825
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,100
So many attacks that he rarely,

1826
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:58,210
rarely ever shows you
the same trick twice.

1827
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,490
And he's the master at adapting.

1828
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,900
So if you do a trick on him
once and you try it again,

1829
00:43:03,901 --> 00:43:04,734
he's going to shut you down.

1830
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,240
So look at all his rematches.

1831
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:07,500
When you read Bj Penn,

1832
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:07,731
when you were,

1833
00:43:07,731 --> 00:43:08,220
you matched Matt.

1834
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:08,850
He was,

1835
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:09,661
every time they read much,

1836
00:43:09,661 --> 00:43:10,590
it was progressively worse.

1837
00:43:10,591 --> 00:43:12,300
The third time you fought
my heels was even easier.

1838
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:14,610
Don't try the same trick on George twice.

1839
00:43:14,611 --> 00:43:15,444
You're going to get crushed.

1840
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:16,800
And I think that's why meal as a,

1841
00:43:16,801 --> 00:43:17,401
as a martial arts,

1842
00:43:17,401 --> 00:43:21,450
I developed like a lot of variety of
skill because every week I'd have to come

1843
00:43:21,451 --> 00:43:23,580
up with a new trick or as George
is going to shut that down.

1844
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:26,040
After 10 years I've been started
becoming like a trickster.

1845
00:43:26,041 --> 00:43:26,251
You know,

1846
00:43:26,251 --> 00:43:29,610
what other magic trick can I get away
with one time because next week I need a

1847
00:43:29,611 --> 00:43:31,200
new trick because it
won't work on him again.

1848
00:43:31,201 --> 00:43:31,530
He's eating,

1849
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:32,430
he's going to get wise to it.

1850
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:34,650
He's a master at add.

1851
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:35,890
It might work once on him.

1852
00:43:35,891 --> 00:43:37,350
The second time you're
going to get shut down.

1853
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,770
Well I feel like that

1854
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:43,520
was a factor in Dominick Cruz
losing to Cody Garbrandt.

1855
00:43:43,521 --> 00:43:43,911
Exactly.

1856
00:43:43,911 --> 00:43:47,600
Cause those Alpha male guys had
seen that check so many times.

1857
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:48,690
Okay.

1858
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:49,523
We can like,

1859
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:54,260
apparently Justin Buchholz can imitate
Dominick Cruz in training like that weird

1860
00:43:54,261 --> 00:43:56,390
Herky jerky movement with the hands down.

1861
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:56,991
Exactly.

1862
00:43:56,991 --> 00:43:57,860
He's a weird one,

1863
00:43:57,861 --> 00:43:58,131
man.

1864
00:43:58,131 --> 00:44:00,950
He's one of the weird at all the
fighters I've ever watched fight.

1865
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:02,510
Dominic might be the weirdest.

1866
00:44:02,511 --> 00:44:03,260
I agree.

1867
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:03,741
Cause you,

1868
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:04,730
you look at him and he's,

1869
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:05,953
first of all,

1870
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,153
he's such a,

1871
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:08,240
he's a great guy.

1872
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:09,470
Very smart guy.

1873
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:11,460
But he's crazy and a weird way.

1874
00:44:11,461 --> 00:44:12,670
It's like one of the things
that he said is like,

1875
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:12,861
hi,

1876
00:44:12,861 --> 00:44:14,020
I'm just not very flexible.

1877
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,130
Like what are you,

1878
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:17,630
why are you even saying that?

1879
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:17,841
Like,

1880
00:44:17,841 --> 00:44:19,250
that doesn't even make any sense to me.

1881
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,500
Like why not get more flexible?

1882
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:22,040
It's like,

1883
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,210
it's not like saying like,

1884
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:23,991
Oh,

1885
00:44:23,991 --> 00:44:24,211
uh,

1886
00:44:24,211 --> 00:44:25,460
I'm too short.

1887
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:27,470
Well you can't grow so you're fucked.

1888
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:32,010
You know you're never gonna to play
basketball saying I'm not flexible enough.

1889
00:44:32,011 --> 00:44:32,910
It's like easy fix.

1890
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,680
That's the dumbest thing to ever say.

1891
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:36,833
I mean it's so,

1892
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,480
it's so much more dumb
than I'm not strong enough.

1893
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:39,811
We will,

1894
00:44:39,811 --> 00:44:41,670
if you gain weight from muscle,

1895
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,560
you might not be in that
weight class anymore.

1896
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:44,610
You've got a real problem there,

1897
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:47,160
but I'm not flexible and
if you got zero problem,

1898
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,360
you just have to stretch.

1899
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,190
But he doesn't stretch.

1900
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:50,411
Right.

1901
00:44:50,411 --> 00:44:52,500
Like we were talking
about Jujitsu techniques,

1902
00:44:52,501 --> 00:44:52,830
it's like,

1903
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:52,981
ah,

1904
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:54,720
I can't play that hard guard guard,

1905
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:55,680
high guard shit.

1906
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:56,950
I don't have any flexibility.

1907
00:44:57,190 --> 00:44:58,023
Okay,

1908
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:02,130
what are you saying like that doesn't
make any sense and like head kicks and

1909
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:03,271
things along those lines.

1910
00:45:03,271 --> 00:45:06,540
He's like very stiff in his legs
with throwing kicks and like that's,

1911
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:07,500
that's an easy fix.

1912
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:08,610
It's an easy fix.

1913
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:09,870
Why wouldn't you fix that?

1914
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:11,213
That's a good question.

1915
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:12,240
But,

1916
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:17,240
but also the mindset of a champion
in this same guy who just just,

1917
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:21,060
fuck it.

1918
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:21,893
I'm not flexible.

1919
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,960
I don't even understand how
those things live together.

1920
00:45:24,961 --> 00:45:27,200
In the same mind if I was treating him,

1921
00:45:27,201 --> 00:45:27,980
I would make him head kick.

1922
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:29,340
Like that's what I would insist on.

1923
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:32,010
All of these have to be there cause he
doesn't knock guys out with his hands.

1924
00:45:32,011 --> 00:45:32,221
So he,

1925
00:45:32,221 --> 00:45:35,130
the head kick has to always
be a possibility always
in Tibet and then you will

1926
00:45:35,131 --> 00:45:39,090
knock out guys with your hands because
they'll have their high guard up because

1927
00:45:39,091 --> 00:45:39,960
they don't want that kick.

1928
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:40,801
And then upper cut,

1929
00:45:40,801 --> 00:45:41,071
we'll come.

1930
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,550
The body shot will come
to the back of the cook.

1931
00:45:42,551 --> 00:45:43,650
I'll make it back for sure.

1932
00:45:43,651 --> 00:45:45,240
Like if you don't have
power in your hands,

1933
00:45:45,241 --> 00:45:46,080
you need to backache.

1934
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:47,220
You need to head kick.

1935
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:50,330
Those are two weapons that can always
knock a guy out so you don't back.

1936
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:52,020
Your feudal hecky can
never score knockouts.

1937
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:52,943
Right?

1938
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:53,581
Yeah.

1939
00:45:53,581 --> 00:45:54,690
That's a good point man.

1940
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:55,860
It's uh,

1941
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:59,610
when did you see this Stephen Thompson
thing with Darren toe where he wants them

1942
00:45:59,611 --> 00:46:01,320
to outlaw that side kick to the knee?

1943
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:02,071
No,

1944
00:46:02,071 --> 00:46:02,760
I didn't see that.

1945
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,730
Well apparently his knee got really
fucked up in the Darren till fight.

1946
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:06,421
You know,

1947
00:46:06,421 --> 00:46:06,730
what do,

1948
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:09,900
what do you think about that side kick
to the knee that everyone's do not even

1949
00:46:09,901 --> 00:46:10,591
the oblique kick.

1950
00:46:10,591 --> 00:46:12,990
Just a front leg side kick to
the knee the same way you're,

1951
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:16,380
well Romero used it on Robert Whitaker
fucked up his knee and the first fight

1952
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:18,270
and then winter could use it on Romero.

1953
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,160
Like right away he was stuck in fight.

1954
00:46:20,161 --> 00:46:21,540
Beautiful to fuck up his knee.

1955
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:23,550
Um,

1956
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:24,900
I think it's a legitimate kick.

1957
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:25,300
Yeah,

1958
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:27,320
it's a legitimate 100% kick it,

1959
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,650
it allows the smaller,

1960
00:46:28,651 --> 00:46:30,240
weaker guide to hurt the bigger,

1961
00:46:30,241 --> 00:46:31,074
stronger guy.

1962
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:31,591
Well,

1963
00:46:31,591 --> 00:46:33,540
in the case of Darren
till it allows the bigger,

1964
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:37,040
stronger guy hurt the other big stronger
if it works for the smaller guy who

1965
00:46:37,041 --> 00:46:37,800
works for the bigger guy.

1966
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:38,161
Yeah,

1967
00:46:38,161 --> 00:46:38,610
right.

1968
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:39,780
It's just a legit,

1969
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:40,050
it's,

1970
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:40,831
I think so too.

1971
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:42,770
It's a legit technique
you have to prepare for.

1972
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:42,990
Yeah,

1973
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:43,501
exactly.

1974
00:46:43,501 --> 00:46:47,280
You're studying in a way that you see
when somebody's standing sideways,

1975
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:49,110
they're harder to punch,

1976
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,370
they're easier to kick.

1977
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:51,961
So you're saying,

1978
00:46:51,961 --> 00:46:52,171
look,

1979
00:46:52,171 --> 00:46:53,880
I want to stand in this way
where I'm harder to budge,

1980
00:46:53,881 --> 00:46:54,900
but I don't want you to kick me.

1981
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:56,850
So if I stand square,

1982
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:00,720
I'm more susceptible to back
kick more sub two punches,

1983
00:47:00,721 --> 00:47:04,170
but less sub susceptible to leg kicks or
the oblique kick or the psychic to the

1984
00:47:04,171 --> 00:47:05,004
knee or whatnot.

1985
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:07,650
Now I'm not saying to you,

1986
00:47:07,651 --> 00:47:10,260
don't punch me cause I'm
more vulnerable this way.

1987
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:12,660
So whatever your vulnerability is,

1988
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:15,360
you chose that vulnerability
by standing sideways.

1989
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:16,890
Why don't the Thai stand sideways?

1990
00:47:16,891 --> 00:47:18,360
Because they know they're going
to get chopped to the leg,

1991
00:47:18,361 --> 00:47:18,541
right?

1992
00:47:18,541 --> 00:47:19,860
They're always fighting good kickers.

1993
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:22,140
They're always fighting amazing kickers.

1994
00:47:22,141 --> 00:47:22,974
When you go to Thailand,

1995
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:26,250
that guy may be a good puncher
but he's for sure a great kicker.

1996
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:28,830
Like you're not going to run into
a guy who doesn't know how to kick.

1997
00:47:28,831 --> 00:47:32,140
They all know how to kick knee and
elbow and some of them know how to punch

1998
00:47:32,141 --> 00:47:32,381
really,

1999
00:47:32,381 --> 00:47:33,340
really well also.

2000
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:34,870
So they stand in away.

2001
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:40,020
Moitai has developed in a way is very
anti kick Antony anti elbow and it's not

2002
00:47:41,231 --> 00:47:42,850
as defensive to the punches.

2003
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:44,170
So if I want to stand,

2004
00:47:44,171 --> 00:47:45,160
if I want to avoid punches,

2005
00:47:45,161 --> 00:47:45,610
I'll stand more.

2006
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:48,850
Bladed lets him and fighting it like a
Bj Penn was very heavy handed and more of

2007
00:47:48,851 --> 00:47:49,241
a puncher.

2008
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,074
It doesn't kick much.

2009
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,750
Well I'm going to stand bladed like you
see what George would made him drop one

2010
00:47:52,751 --> 00:47:53,584
hand.

2011
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:54,071
Why?

2012
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:55,600
So he can use his jab from,

2013
00:47:55,630 --> 00:47:56,710
from down to up.

2014
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:56,941
Right.

2015
00:47:56,941 --> 00:47:57,774
Cause it's faster,

2016
00:47:58,150 --> 00:48:00,040
has a greater reach and
it's harder to counter.

2017
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:03,370
Whereas if you would've stood more
square and Moitai would have been useless

2018
00:48:03,371 --> 00:48:04,510
because Bj doesn't kick,

2019
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,790
but then you'd be more open to punches.

2020
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,160
So the way you're standing,

2021
00:48:09,161 --> 00:48:12,370
the way one of the boys standing
that the antagonist to that,

2022
00:48:12,371 --> 00:48:14,020
that the antidote to that is that a kick?

2023
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:16,480
So how could you stand that way?

2024
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:17,260
Just swished away.

2025
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:18,370
You're stunning and now it,

2026
00:48:18,371 --> 00:48:18,641
okay,

2027
00:48:18,641 --> 00:48:20,170
now you're more open to punches.

2028
00:48:20,171 --> 00:48:20,951
But that's adaptation.

2029
00:48:20,951 --> 00:48:21,880
That's what fighting is about.

2030
00:48:21,930 --> 00:48:22,300
Yeah.

2031
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:22,721
It's rock,

2032
00:48:22,721 --> 00:48:22,991
paper,

2033
00:48:22,991 --> 00:48:23,350
scissors.

2034
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:24,210
If I use rock,

2035
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:24,980
I don't,

2036
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:25,870
I don't outlaw paper.

2037
00:48:25,871 --> 00:48:26,471
I don't say everybody.

2038
00:48:26,471 --> 00:48:26,571
Hey,

2039
00:48:26,571 --> 00:48:27,580
nobody is allowed to use paper.

2040
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:28,241
No,

2041
00:48:28,241 --> 00:48:29,710
but that's the antidote
to what you're doing.

2042
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:30,400
Yeah.

2043
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,510
And when the ties fight,

2044
00:48:31,511 --> 00:48:35,230
they have that very light front leg which
would prevent that front leg side kick

2045
00:48:35,231 --> 00:48:35,680
to the knee.

2046
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,150
Exactly.

2047
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:37,630
Cause they're always like very light.

2048
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:39,070
So if you kicked their knee there,

2049
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:41,110
it's just going to go backwards to stand.

2050
00:48:41,111 --> 00:48:42,640
That way they're standing
that we had a cost,

2051
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:43,010
yes.

2052
00:48:43,010 --> 00:48:44,650
Punches and also the cost.

2053
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:48,100
They don't have the ability
to use that movement,

2054
00:48:48,101 --> 00:48:48,910
that flattery.

2055
00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:49,870
Front leg movement.

2056
00:48:49,871 --> 00:48:54,490
The way that Wonderboy does to Wonderboy
is the master of the front leg.

2057
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:55,360
Like he,

2058
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:58,060
he's the best at standing
completely sidekick.

2059
00:48:58,250 --> 00:48:58,390
The,

2060
00:48:58,390 --> 00:48:59,740
when he fought Johnny Hendricks,

2061
00:48:59,741 --> 00:49:00,574
good example,

2062
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:02,500
he threw a side kick to the body.

2063
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:06,040
Hendrick stood there and then he went
to roundhouse kicked Masta ace with the

2064
00:49:06,041 --> 00:49:07,370
same leg masterpiece and,

2065
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:09,340
and Hendricks he could see was like fuck.

2066
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,500
Like what does this guy do?

2067
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:11,563
It was like thumb,

2068
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:12,640
okay back.

2069
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:13,450
Oh Shit.

2070
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:14,620
Like he thought like,

2071
00:49:14,621 --> 00:49:14,831
yeah,

2072
00:49:14,831 --> 00:49:15,581
you got me with that,

2073
00:49:15,581 --> 00:49:16,540
but that's not a big deal.

2074
00:49:16,541 --> 00:49:17,141
And then pop,

2075
00:49:17,141 --> 00:49:18,490
he gets roundhouse kicked in the face.

2076
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,680
That was a masterful performance.

2077
00:49:20,681 --> 00:49:21,220
Yeah.

2078
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:21,461
Yeah.

2079
00:49:21,461 --> 00:49:23,140
It was one of his best
for sure is incredible.

2080
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:23,420
Well,

2081
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:26,560
it just shows you the
difference between a guy who is,

2082
00:49:26,561 --> 00:49:26,830
you know,

2083
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:31,830
just trying to like kind of plot in with
limited movement and a guy like wonder

2084
00:49:32,151 --> 00:49:35,980
boy who's just one of the most
difficult guys to sort of pin down.

2085
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,000
Yeah.

2086
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:37,833
Incredible.

2087
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:38,141
Yeah,

2088
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:40,140
his style is very unique and I'm,

2089
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:43,630
I'm a fascinated with him and I'm really
fascinated right now with Michael Venom

2090
00:49:43,631 --> 00:49:45,250
page been watching.

2091
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:47,050
Do you see as pro boxing fights?

2092
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:47,381
No,

2093
00:49:47,381 --> 00:49:49,210
I didn't see right now he's a [inaudible].

2094
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:49,791
I saw one.

2095
00:49:49,791 --> 00:49:50,050
Yeah,

2096
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:50,980
he's a can crusher.

2097
00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:54,160
He's fighting these guys then
they're setting them up for these,

2098
00:49:54,161 --> 00:49:54,460
yeah,

2099
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:55,870
spectacular knockouts.

2100
00:49:56,070 --> 00:49:56,380
Right.

2101
00:49:56,380 --> 00:50:01,380
But it's still that blitz point karate
style that Raymond Daniels has a lot of

2102
00:50:01,721 --> 00:50:05,440
these guys have in Raymond's obviously
adapted very well for kickboxing.

2103
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:06,850
I've changed with Raymond quite a bit.

2104
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:07,680
He's a beast.

2105
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:08,850
You've got to get them
on the show and he says,

2106
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:09,791
yeah,

2107
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:10,550
I have to connect you to.

2108
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:10,950
Okay.

2109
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:11,680
He's amazing.

2110
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:11,891
Yeah.

2111
00:50:11,891 --> 00:50:15,610
We had talked a little bit in the past
about perhaps doing something on Twitter.

2112
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:20,260
He knocks guys out in about
90 seconds on a regular basis.

2113
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:22,090
And how does he do it?

2114
00:50:22,091 --> 00:50:23,050
He does it with the back kick.

2115
00:50:23,051 --> 00:50:25,420
He's the master at finding
a place for the back kick.

2116
00:50:25,421 --> 00:50:26,890
You don't want to get
hit with his back kick.

2117
00:50:26,891 --> 00:50:28,760
Like I know you got incredible backache.

2118
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:30,020
I bet you some more powerful than his.

2119
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,033
Okay.

2120
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:32,143
But I'll tell you one thing.

2121
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:35,030
He will fit that back kick everywhere,

2122
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:35,690
everywhere.

2123
00:50:35,690 --> 00:50:38,630
And he'll do it in a way
you won't see it coming.

2124
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:39,890
And it's gonna hurt so much more.

2125
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:41,660
But he rarely knucks
guys out with his hands.

2126
00:50:41,661 --> 00:50:43,220
He does surprise guys with
his hands every so often.

2127
00:50:43,221 --> 00:50:44,080
But that back kick you,

2128
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:44,923
you don't want to be there.

2129
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,850
Well he seems like he's
getting better with his hands.

2130
00:50:46,930 --> 00:50:47,270
Yes.

2131
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:47,430
Yes.

2132
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:48,320
Sands are improving,

2133
00:50:48,321 --> 00:50:49,220
but he trains a lot.

2134
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:49,590
Yeah.

2135
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:50,320
And trains a lot that go.

2136
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:50,661
I'm sure.

2137
00:50:50,661 --> 00:50:51,171
I mean he's,

2138
00:50:51,171 --> 00:50:51,441
he's a,

2139
00:50:51,441 --> 00:50:52,820
he's still at it and he's what,

2140
00:50:52,821 --> 00:50:54,950
35 36 now I would say around that.

2141
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,720
That one was it?

2142
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:57,613
Uh,

2143
00:50:57,950 --> 00:50:58,470
what's his name?

2144
00:50:58,470 --> 00:50:59,303
I'm bang.

2145
00:50:59,310 --> 00:51:03,020
Was that the guy he knocked out with
that touch front leg side kick and then

2146
00:51:03,021 --> 00:51:04,150
jumped on my God,

2147
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,600
the spinning back kick to the face.

2148
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:08,660
Woo Game Shits.

2149
00:51:08,661 --> 00:51:12,020
I believe he just jumps up top pop
and they had some of the second kick.

2150
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:12,340
Yeah,

2151
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:12,600
double.

2152
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:13,341
It's a standard.

2153
00:51:13,341 --> 00:51:14,080
Kik Is,

2154
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:14,421
it is,

2155
00:51:14,421 --> 00:51:15,080
you know for,

2156
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:15,861
for Redmond Dan,

2157
00:51:15,861 --> 00:51:17,810
he does it the best I've
ever seen personally.

2158
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:18,290
No,

2159
00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:19,010
no one better.

2160
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:21,440
You know you to go back to
like Rick the jet Rufus.

2161
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:22,061
Oh Man.

2162
00:51:22,061 --> 00:51:22,470
You know what,

2163
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:23,630
when he fought that the,

2164
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:27,080
that really classic fight where he fought
that tie fighter and he got his legs

2165
00:51:27,081 --> 00:51:28,640
chopped out and everybody was like,

2166
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:29,600
Oh shit,

2167
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:30,591
people really got it.

2168
00:51:30,591 --> 00:51:32,390
Understand the Vojtech Moy Tai,

2169
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:34,520
but he hit that guy that same kick,

2170
00:51:34,521 --> 00:51:37,190
that front leg side kick him and spun
in the air and hit him with the turning

2171
00:51:37,191 --> 00:51:38,090
side kick in the face.

2172
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:38,800
Yeah.

2173
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,633
Yeah Man,

2174
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:42,320
I love watching that point.

2175
00:51:42,321 --> 00:51:42,981
Karate style,

2176
00:51:42,981 --> 00:51:44,180
that blitz style.

2177
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:44,600
I love it.

2178
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:49,040
I love watching that enter into MMA
because I used to spar with a lot of those

2179
00:51:49,041 --> 00:51:52,990
guys and it's fucking hard to deal with
those guys that are really good at that,

2180
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:58,020
that that fast sprint at you blitz and
when you do that and then you also have

2181
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:00,980
takedown defense and Muay
Thai skills and Jujitsu,

2182
00:52:00,981 --> 00:52:01,640
it's like,

2183
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:02,151
fuck man,

2184
00:52:02,151 --> 00:52:04,130
that's so let's a lethal skill to have.

2185
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:05,030
I love,

2186
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:06,080
I love doing boxing.

2187
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:07,010
Boy Ty karate,

2188
00:52:07,011 --> 00:52:07,850
taekwondo,

2189
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:08,540
I love,

2190
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:09,470
I love blending it all.

2191
00:52:09,471 --> 00:52:10,820
I believe all of your right here.

2192
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:11,580
Boom.

2193
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:12,470
It's just play that,

2194
00:52:12,650 --> 00:52:13,760
play that back again.

2195
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:15,260
I mean come on man.

2196
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:17,120
This is fucking crazy shit.

2197
00:52:17,121 --> 00:52:18,110
The way he does it too,

2198
00:52:18,410 --> 00:52:19,460
he just hops up,

2199
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:23,270
touches you with the front leg
pains and the second ones and look,

2200
00:52:23,271 --> 00:52:26,210
he looks down like he's
in a fucking video game.

2201
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:30,230
I mean that is crazy that
this guy is pulling that off.

2202
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:32,030
That was when he was in glory.

2203
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:33,860
Look at this tap boom.

2204
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:34,730
I mean,

2205
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:35,730
come on man.

2206
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:36,980
Well fuck does that.

2207
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,470
And he does that all the time.

2208
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:39,870
That's,

2209
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:40,260
that's not,

2210
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:41,270
that's not like a one off.

2211
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:41,631
No,

2212
00:52:41,631 --> 00:52:41,871
no.

2213
00:52:41,871 --> 00:52:42,950
He could do that all day.

2214
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:43,580
Yeah.

2215
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:47,530
I mean there's a lot of those
karate guys that have that skillset,

2216
00:52:47,610 --> 00:52:48,770
they can do like,

2217
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:49,221
you know,

2218
00:52:49,221 --> 00:52:52,460
those breaking demonstrations with their
hold up pads don't do three 60 wheel

2219
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:55,400
kicks and brake pads and I mean there's,

2220
00:52:55,430 --> 00:53:00,290
there's some legitimate PR karate and
traditional martial arts techniques that

2221
00:53:00,291 --> 00:53:01,610
are finding their way into MMA.

2222
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:02,131
Absolutely.

2223
00:53:02,131 --> 00:53:03,440
You just have to know how to use it.

2224
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:04,900
And the,

2225
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:07,700
just because aquatic guy got beat up by
a grappler doesn't mean all the karate

2226
00:53:07,701 --> 00:53:08,361
he's trained.

2227
00:53:08,361 --> 00:53:09,020
It's not good.

2228
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:09,531
Exactly.

2229
00:53:09,531 --> 00:53:09,971
These loves,

2230
00:53:09,971 --> 00:53:11,120
that needs to learn how to grapple.

2231
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:11,661
Exactly.

2232
00:53:11,661 --> 00:53:13,970
He needs to know how I stay on his feet
and he's learning how to grapple and he

2233
00:53:13,971 --> 00:53:15,830
needs to learn to set
that kickup in a way.

2234
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:19,490
Because I think as if you're always
fighting another karate guy and then you

2235
00:53:19,491 --> 00:53:20,121
fight a boxer,

2236
00:53:20,121 --> 00:53:20,720
the boxer,

2237
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:21,830
his behavior is just different.

2238
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:22,461
You have to get you,

2239
00:53:22,461 --> 00:53:24,740
it's like what we're saying before you
have to get used to it and then all of a

2240
00:53:24,741 --> 00:53:26,190
sudden you saw the same movie a hundred

2241
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:27,023
times.

2242
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:28,050
You know how to deal with it.

2243
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:28,261
You know,

2244
00:53:28,261 --> 00:53:30,030
it's like you're watching the
same movie over and over again.

2245
00:53:30,031 --> 00:53:30,864
You start,

2246
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:33,200
you start predicting what
the scene is going to be.

2247
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,250
You're not caught by surprise
when you're caught by surprise,

2248
00:53:35,251 --> 00:53:36,084
you're done right.

2249
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:39,330
You'd never done Jitsu before and
I'm doing an armbar basic onboard.

2250
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:40,213
You're getting caught with it.

2251
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:40,891
You know?

2252
00:53:40,891 --> 00:53:42,660
That's why I believe you got
to know everything out there,

2253
00:53:42,661 --> 00:53:43,740
but you've got to specialize.

2254
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:44,041
Don't,

2255
00:53:44,041 --> 00:53:45,240
don't try to master everything.

2256
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:47,430
Know everything.

2257
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:48,451
Like,

2258
00:53:48,451 --> 00:53:50,070
I like to know Doris Triangle.

2259
00:53:50,071 --> 00:53:50,460
He'll hook.

2260
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:52,290
Even though I'm not a
necessarily a dark sky,

2261
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:54,270
but I want to know everything about Doris.

2262
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:55,470
I don't want to drill it all day long.

2263
00:53:55,471 --> 00:53:56,400
I just want to know about it.

2264
00:53:56,610 --> 00:53:57,180
Right.

2265
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:58,630
Because when you're
trying to put your Darson,

2266
00:53:58,650 --> 00:53:59,760
I know what you're trying to do.

2267
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:01,500
I'm familiar with what you're going for.

2268
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:02,260
I can break out of it.

2269
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:03,420
You don't go for Darson.

2270
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:03,781
I do.

2271
00:54:03,781 --> 00:54:04,111
I do.

2272
00:54:04,111 --> 00:54:04,351
I do.

2273
00:54:04,351 --> 00:54:05,280
But I mean,

2274
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:06,300
I'm not,

2275
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:07,680
I wouldn't say it's my best submission.

2276
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:08,730
I do do the arses.

2277
00:54:08,731 --> 00:54:09,564
No doubt about it.

2278
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:10,880
You don't have the longs arms.

2279
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:11,940
Exactly.

2280
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:12,331
Exact.

2281
00:54:12,331 --> 00:54:14,010
Do you ever try Japanese Necktie?

2282
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:15,090
Uh,

2283
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:15,670
yes,

2284
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:16,650
I don't use them that much,

2285
00:54:16,651 --> 00:54:17,011
but I am,

2286
00:54:17,011 --> 00:54:20,310
I'm familiar with the solution
for guys who don't have long arms.

2287
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:21,660
I have short arms too.

2288
00:54:21,661 --> 00:54:24,980
But the Japanese necktie became a
specialist at that when you really,

2289
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:25,261
yeah,

2290
00:54:25,261 --> 00:54:28,530
you get that clamp over the time of the
neck and then you drop down with the

2291
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:31,980
left shoulder and you tuck the head into
the forehead and you hook one of the

2292
00:54:31,981 --> 00:54:33,020
legs with your legs.

2293
00:54:33,021 --> 00:54:33,810
Yay.

2294
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:34,770
Crack that neck.

2295
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:38,160
So you're pushing in with your
chest and then cracking that.

2296
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:38,640
It's,

2297
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:39,473
it comes,

2298
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:40,530
it comes to,

2299
00:54:40,531 --> 00:54:41,430
it's a nasty,

2300
00:54:41,431 --> 00:54:42,540
nasty neck crank.

2301
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:43,650
I love it.

2302
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:44,610
It's just so good.

2303
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:45,650
And it's also,

2304
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:46,000
it's,

2305
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,040
it's there a lot.

2306
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:48,840
It's one of those techniques that people,

2307
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,630
they're not aware of the
danger that that one position,

2308
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:52,531
you know,

2309
00:54:52,531 --> 00:54:55,500
there's a few guys that are
really good at it and you know,

2310
00:54:55,530 --> 00:54:58,200
whenever you feel that arm
going underneath your neck,

2311
00:54:58,201 --> 00:54:58,411
you're like,

2312
00:54:58,411 --> 00:54:58,771
fuck,

2313
00:54:58,771 --> 00:54:59,610
I gotta get Outta here.

2314
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,800
Cause it's such an easy one to cinch up.

2315
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:03,120
Doris is hard.

2316
00:55:03,330 --> 00:55:05,550
It's hard to synch to get all the way up.

2317
00:55:06,030 --> 00:55:06,780
Yeah.

2318
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:06,961
Like,

2319
00:55:06,961 --> 00:55:08,100
I remember working with Marcello,

2320
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:11,250
like I got to trade Marcello Garcia and a,

2321
00:55:11,251 --> 00:55:13,560
we're doing it just a one
on one training session.

2322
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:14,423
And uh,

2323
00:55:14,610 --> 00:55:17,220
he was telling me he doesn't
like Doris when I was like,

2324
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:18,000
he doesn't teach stars,

2325
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:18,870
doesn't believe in Doris.

2326
00:55:18,990 --> 00:55:19,823
And I'm like,

2327
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:21,120
but your arms are short.

2328
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:21,540
You know,

2329
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:23,190
if you have this monstrously long guy,

2330
00:55:23,191 --> 00:55:24,180
you won't tell them to do darks.

2331
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:24,341
No,

2332
00:55:24,341 --> 00:55:24,421
no,

2333
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:24,541
no.

2334
00:55:24,541 --> 00:55:25,070
Don't do the,

2335
00:55:25,070 --> 00:55:25,411
it's not good.

2336
00:55:25,411 --> 00:55:26,850
It's not good submission
because your arms in the way.

2337
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:27,751
I'm like,

2338
00:55:27,751 --> 00:55:27,990
dude,

2339
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:30,120
there's some guys with
w the most devastating.

2340
00:55:30,121 --> 00:55:30,751
Darcy's like you,

2341
00:55:30,751 --> 00:55:31,990
you don't want to be in their doors.

2342
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:33,330
You know Tony Ferguson.

2343
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:33,571
Yeah,

2344
00:55:33,571 --> 00:55:34,380
exactly.

2345
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:35,280
He doesn't like leg locks.

2346
00:55:35,281 --> 00:55:36,360
Has No leg locks are no good.

2347
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:36,820
But oh,

2348
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:37,860
that's so crazy.

2349
00:55:37,861 --> 00:55:40,470
I imagine a Paul Harris Walks
into your gym and you're like,

2350
00:55:40,471 --> 00:55:40,591
no,

2351
00:55:40,591 --> 00:55:41,031
don't do leg.

2352
00:55:41,031 --> 00:55:41,371
Like it's like,

2353
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:41,551
dude,

2354
00:55:41,551 --> 00:55:42,151
that's his gay.

2355
00:55:42,151 --> 00:55:45,210
But he tapped out Rico
Rodriguez with a heel hook.

2356
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:46,330
I would die.

2357
00:55:46,330 --> 00:55:47,280
He would tell you it was there.

2358
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:48,210
It's not a good submission.

2359
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:48,990
It shouldn't have worked.

2360
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:49,321
Oh,

2361
00:55:49,321 --> 00:55:50,460
that's hilarious.

2362
00:55:50,490 --> 00:55:52,590
He was telling me he doesn't
like his guys to wrestle.

2363
00:55:52,591 --> 00:55:52,801
I'm like,

2364
00:55:52,801 --> 00:55:53,634
why?

2365
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:54,031
I'm like,

2366
00:55:54,031 --> 00:55:56,700
when you fudge it shields you did
a single leg and he took him down.

2367
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:57,121
He was like,

2368
00:55:57,121 --> 00:55:57,954
he shouldn't have fell.

2369
00:55:58,330 --> 00:55:59,420
See Jake shields shouldn't have fell.

2370
00:55:59,430 --> 00:55:59,701
He said,

2371
00:55:59,701 --> 00:56:00,121
but I'm like,

2372
00:56:00,121 --> 00:56:01,110
you're wrestling is good.

2373
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:02,350
He's like,

2374
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:02,480
no,

2375
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:02,560
no,

2376
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:02,720
no.

2377
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,020
You shouldn't wrestle a wrestler at all.

2378
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:05,160
What that was like.

2379
00:56:05,161 --> 00:56:05,701
I get,

2380
00:56:05,701 --> 00:56:06,720
I get what you're trying to say,

2381
00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:09,000
but there's a time of place
while wrestle a wrestler.

2382
00:56:09,001 --> 00:56:10,620
When I see a good vulnerability.

2383
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:11,400
Yeah.

2384
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,270
And um,

2385
00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:12,571
I don't know.

2386
00:56:12,571 --> 00:56:12,661
He,

2387
00:56:12,661 --> 00:56:13,231
he's very,

2388
00:56:13,231 --> 00:56:14,430
I think he's changed over the years.

2389
00:56:14,431 --> 00:56:14,941
But when I was,

2390
00:56:14,941 --> 00:56:15,571
when I rolled with him,

2391
00:56:15,571 --> 00:56:16,381
he was like at the top.

2392
00:56:16,381 --> 00:56:16,531
You know,

2393
00:56:16,531 --> 00:56:16,860
you,

2394
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:17,820
I wouldn't question him.

2395
00:56:17,821 --> 00:56:18,630
I wouldn't write the NL.

2396
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:19,260
Who am I?

2397
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:20,730
Who am I to tell him I don't agree.

2398
00:56:20,731 --> 00:56:20,911
You know?

2399
00:56:20,911 --> 00:56:22,080
Like he doesn't like Kimora.

2400
00:56:22,081 --> 00:56:23,980
He would tell me not too much muscle.

2401
00:56:23,981 --> 00:56:24,370
Right.

2402
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:25,360
That's what he said to powerful.

2403
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:26,250
It's powerful.

2404
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:26,860
Yeah.

2405
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:28,000
But when you look at his career,

2406
00:56:28,001 --> 00:56:28,150
he,

2407
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:29,140
all of the things he doesn't like.

2408
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:29,390
He's,

2409
00:56:29,390 --> 00:56:30,280
that's what he's been caught with.

2410
00:56:30,281 --> 00:56:34,890
Like a radio caught him with
a Doris Shakuri Kamora yeah,

2411
00:56:35,090 --> 00:56:35,923
yeah,

2412
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:36,570
that's right.

2413
00:56:36,570 --> 00:56:37,750
It didn't,

2414
00:56:37,751 --> 00:56:38,560
um,

2415
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:41,640
who else caught him with the Darce
and Braulio caught him once or twice.

2416
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:42,250
Once I think.

2417
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:43,440
Um,

2418
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:43,700
oh.

2419
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:44,533
Uh,

2420
00:56:45,130 --> 00:56:46,330
they'll caught them with Doris.

2421
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:47,651
Doris work,

2422
00:56:47,651 --> 00:56:48,484
real good data.

2423
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:50,680
They do like if you have the attributes,

2424
00:56:50,681 --> 00:56:51,011
they're great.

2425
00:56:51,011 --> 00:56:51,251
Yeah.

2426
00:56:51,251 --> 00:56:52,800
Why would he say he does a decent died?

2427
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:53,643
That's so crazy.

2428
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:55,220
I think he's got short arms and Fab.

2429
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:56,083
It doesn't work.

2430
00:56:56,170 --> 00:56:57,520
He doesn't like a arm triangle.

2431
00:56:57,660 --> 00:56:58,061
It says no,

2432
00:56:58,061 --> 00:56:58,894
forget the arm triangle.

2433
00:56:59,380 --> 00:56:59,651
Yeah.

2434
00:56:59,651 --> 00:57:00,011
I'm like,

2435
00:57:00,011 --> 00:57:00,690
dude,

2436
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:01,900
that's was Prince George's arm.

2437
00:57:01,901 --> 00:57:03,550
Triangle triangles and nasty.

2438
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:04,990
This destructive.

2439
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:05,910
What guy like George,

2440
00:57:05,911 --> 00:57:06,790
he's sits a crusher.

2441
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:08,530
He's got long arms and he's heavy,

2442
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:10,150
heavy,

2443
00:57:10,150 --> 00:57:12,820
puts that weight on you and
knows how to control and squish.

2444
00:57:12,821 --> 00:57:15,190
Never let my arm get across my
body because I know it's over.

2445
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:19,180
There's two things you never want to
give George Kimora because he'll rip your

2446
00:57:19,181 --> 00:57:20,890
arm off and too dark.

2447
00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:21,920
Uh,

2448
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,140
a triangle triangle.

2449
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:23,590
Yeah.

2450
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:24,880
Catholic Hatami Yeah.

2451
00:57:24,881 --> 00:57:25,270
There's,

2452
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:27,610
there's a Rafael Lovato.

2453
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:28,120
He's,

2454
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:30,370
he's got a nasty fucking arm trying,

2455
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:30,760
you know,

2456
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:32,600
he's competing in Beltour now I'm,

2457
00:57:32,601 --> 00:57:35,170
I'm always fascinated
when I see like super,

2458
00:57:35,171 --> 00:57:39,280
super high level Jujitsu guys that
enter into MMA because I'm like,

2459
00:57:39,281 --> 00:57:39,670
okay,

2460
00:57:39,670 --> 00:57:44,670
well for sure these guys who are used
to just training MMA and trained,

2461
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:47,590
they're not going to know
what the fuck it's them.

2462
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:51,640
When a guy like [inaudible] Gracie grabs
him or like a guy like Damien Maia and

2463
00:57:51,641 --> 00:57:52,990
we've seen it time and time again,

2464
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:53,310
there's,

2465
00:57:53,310 --> 00:57:55,030
there's a difference in the level.

2466
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:56,500
And so the argument is always,

2467
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:58,750
should you be just like,

2468
00:57:58,751 --> 00:58:00,160
what's the best way to be?

2469
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:03,940
Is the best way to be an elite
specialist at one particular thing,

2470
00:58:03,941 --> 00:58:06,070
like a Raymond Daniels or a Wonderboy?

2471
00:58:06,430 --> 00:58:10,810
Or is it to be a guy who can kind
of do everything really well?

2472
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:11,740
Like George?

2473
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:13,930
So here's my perspective on that.

2474
00:58:13,931 --> 00:58:14,890
That's such a great question.

2475
00:58:14,891 --> 00:58:15,940
I mean that's the heart of training.

2476
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:19,810
You could flood your system so that,

2477
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:20,321
what does that mean?

2478
00:58:20,321 --> 00:58:21,131
When you flood your system,

2479
00:58:21,131 --> 00:58:23,140
you're giving your student
too many things to master.

2480
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:24,910
He's just really not good at anything.

2481
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:26,223
Right.

2482
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:27,670
Or you can bottleneck him.

2483
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:31,150
You're giving him too few skills
that people know what he does.

2484
00:58:31,151 --> 00:58:31,581
Like for instance,

2485
00:58:31,581 --> 00:58:32,500
like classic examples,

2486
00:58:32,501 --> 00:58:33,100
Chuck Liddell,

2487
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:34,450
he went on a tear for a while,

2488
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:37,030
but he's still the same guy and
after a while the next generation,

2489
00:58:37,031 --> 00:58:38,140
they understood what he does.

2490
00:58:38,141 --> 00:58:39,670
They understood the
pockets where you're safe,

2491
00:58:39,671 --> 00:58:40,504
where you're in danger,

2492
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:41,501
like machine does.

2493
00:58:41,501 --> 00:58:42,334
A great example.

2494
00:58:42,610 --> 00:58:44,260
Early on he was such a mystery.

2495
00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:44,861
Now we're like,

2496
00:58:44,861 --> 00:58:45,071
okay,

2497
00:58:45,071 --> 00:58:45,880
we get what he does.

2498
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:47,290
We've understood his patterns.

2499
00:58:47,291 --> 00:58:50,020
Patterns are huge and
fighting and in life period.

2500
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:53,770
Human beings or pattern
detecting machines,

2501
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:54,910
whether they know it or not,

2502
00:58:54,911 --> 00:58:56,380
whether they can verbalize it or not,

2503
00:58:57,130 --> 00:58:58,780
we are pattern detecting machines.

2504
00:58:58,781 --> 00:59:00,610
That's why I like sparring
a lot because sparring,

2505
00:59:01,030 --> 00:59:02,860
I've had a thousand people
throw a right hand at me.

2506
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:04,930
When you throw your by hand my mind,

2507
00:59:04,931 --> 00:59:07,810
the subconscious is going to compare
that right hind you're throwing to a

2508
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:11,110
thousand different ranch hands I saw and
it's going to say it looks matches this

2509
00:59:11,111 --> 00:59:11,651
one the most.

2510
00:59:11,651 --> 00:59:11,861
Again,

2511
00:59:11,861 --> 00:59:15,910
this is my narrative and this is what
I see and this is personally been my

2512
00:59:15,911 --> 00:59:16,421
experience,

2513
00:59:16,421 --> 00:59:16,900
right?

2514
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:19,300
When I train somebody who's new
and you throw a punch at them,

2515
00:59:19,301 --> 00:59:20,080
they flinch,

2516
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:22,320
why you've overwhelmed

2517
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:23,153
them with information.

2518
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:26,780
But after awhile they see a punch and
they're relaxed and they see it in eaten

2519
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:28,040
and it seems slow motion.

2520
00:59:28,041 --> 00:59:29,360
Cause at first it was too fast for them.

2521
00:59:29,361 --> 00:59:30,260
It's too much to compute.

2522
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,001
So my students,

2523
00:59:32,001 --> 00:59:34,940
what I do is I give them a small amount
of technique and when they get better I

2524
00:59:34,941 --> 00:59:36,020
give them a new technique.

2525
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:40,400
So I want them to get a certain level
of competence with that technique.

2526
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:43,040
And my standard is it
has to be instinctual.

2527
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:45,140
If the technique is instinctual,

2528
00:59:45,141 --> 00:59:50,141
I've taught it to well meaning if you've
done it live on the mat on a regular

2529
00:59:50,151 --> 00:59:50,541
basis,

2530
00:59:50,541 --> 00:59:51,830
you execute on a regular basis.

2531
00:59:52,070 --> 00:59:55,250
It's not for me not to give you another
gym because if I don't give you another

2532
00:59:55,251 --> 00:59:55,491
gem,

2533
00:59:55,491 --> 00:59:57,230
I'm going to bottleneck your art.

2534
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:58,970
You're going to become too predictable.

2535
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:01,160
But if I give you a gem too early,

2536
01:00:01,161 --> 01:00:02,390
if I give you another technique too early,

2537
01:00:02,391 --> 01:00:03,470
I'm flooding your system.

2538
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:05,540
I'm flooding the your game.

2539
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:07,820
It's your game is just is diluted.

2540
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:08,931
It's just two weeks.

2541
01:00:08,931 --> 01:00:09,531
So with George,

2542
01:00:09,531 --> 01:00:11,360
we're always reinventing
George for the next fight.

2543
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:15,380
We're always adding one new or two new
gems depending how much time we have,

2544
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,420
but there's always an x
factor when you fight him.

2545
01:00:17,421 --> 01:00:19,520
He's not going to do the same
patterns we did the last fight.

2546
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:21,020
You could watch his tape.

2547
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:22,363
That's why I told George,

2548
01:00:22,580 --> 01:00:25,040
why is it harder to be championed
than to become champion?

2549
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:26,330
Because when you're champion,

2550
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:28,460
everybody's watching you
in studying your patterns.

2551
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:31,280
It's a matter of time
before you're old news,

2552
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:34,580
so you've got to reinvent
yourself before the next fight.

2553
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:37,370
That's why I didn't want him
fighting three times a year.

2554
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:40,820
I told me to fight twice a year and
there were making comparative with Chuck.

2555
01:00:40,821 --> 01:00:41,930
I got a lot of heat for that.

2556
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:43,070
They're like chuck fights
three times a year.

2557
01:00:43,071 --> 01:00:44,090
George would fight three times a year.

2558
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:44,781
We're like,

2559
01:00:44,781 --> 01:00:45,171
we'll see what,

2560
01:00:45,171 --> 01:00:45,320
how,

2561
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:46,890
how hard careers go be.

2562
01:00:46,891 --> 01:00:49,640
I want George to fight twice a
year because to reinvent them,

2563
01:00:49,641 --> 01:00:50,540
take six months,

2564
01:00:51,290 --> 01:00:52,370
we're going to do that twice a year.

2565
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:54,470
That way he'll be champion longer.

2566
01:00:54,471 --> 01:00:54,830
I told him,

2567
01:00:54,830 --> 01:00:56,340
I saw him when he became champ.

2568
01:00:56,341 --> 01:00:56,541
He said,

2569
01:00:56,541 --> 01:00:58,040
I want you to be champion for 10 years.

2570
01:00:58,310 --> 01:01:01,040
It happens in boxing is gonna
Happen to an MMA for the first time?

2571
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:02,810
There's going to be a
champion for 10 years.

2572
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:04,571
I used to tell him that when,

2573
01:01:04,571 --> 01:01:06,560
when he first won the
belt and he was like,

2574
01:01:06,561 --> 01:01:06,741
really?

2575
01:01:06,741 --> 01:01:07,310
How are we gonna do that?

2576
01:01:07,310 --> 01:01:07,910
You're going to read,

2577
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:08,630
we're going to cycle.

2578
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:10,940
We're going to do only training
camps that last six months.

2579
01:01:11,270 --> 01:01:13,370
You can only really do a
20 cap every six months.

2580
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:14,570
If you want to hit a new level,

2581
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:15,800
it takes six months.

2582
01:01:16,310 --> 01:01:18,800
Every fight you got to be at a new
level and you get to do something.

2583
01:01:18,801 --> 01:01:20,630
Nobody knows did they
haven't seen it before.

2584
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:22,430
How did you come up with these numbers?

2585
01:01:22,431 --> 01:01:22,581
What,

2586
01:01:22,581 --> 01:01:23,510
what made you decide?

2587
01:01:23,530 --> 01:01:23,900
Um,

2588
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:24,530
I read once,

2589
01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:29,390
I read one very influential book called
the New Power Program by Michael Colgan.

2590
01:01:29,391 --> 01:01:30,260
I don't know if you ever heard of it.

2591
01:01:30,530 --> 01:01:31,400
I have heard of the book.

2592
01:01:31,401 --> 01:01:32,234
I haven't read a book.

2593
01:01:32,270 --> 01:01:32,631
He says,

2594
01:01:32,631 --> 01:01:32,811
look,

2595
01:01:32,811 --> 01:01:33,680
there's two programs.

2596
01:01:33,681 --> 01:01:34,514
There's either,

2597
01:01:34,970 --> 01:01:35,331
he says,

2598
01:01:35,331 --> 01:01:36,164
look,

2599
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:39,530
if you can do a training
program shorter than six months,

2600
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:43,350
you're either superman or your like.

2601
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,110
He formulated the way he says,

2602
01:01:45,111 --> 01:01:45,950
I never met Superman.

2603
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:48,230
A real training program
is six months long,

2604
01:01:49,430 --> 01:01:51,020
so that's just always
really influenced me.

2605
01:01:51,021 --> 01:01:52,070
I think his book was really,

2606
01:01:52,071 --> 01:01:55,910
really basic and this is one of the first
books I read on training and it really

2607
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:56,481
influenced me.

2608
01:01:56,481 --> 01:01:56,750
He taught,

2609
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:57,200
he taught,

2610
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,550
he teaches in the book periodization,

2611
01:01:58,551 --> 01:01:59,900
but he dumbs it down really,

2612
01:01:59,901 --> 01:02:00,734
really well.

2613
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:01,730
So if you read to the pump,

2614
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:05,840
pompous book on periodization is
just too much at intellectual jargon.

2615
01:02:05,841 --> 01:02:07,100
It's hard for a regular Joe,

2616
01:02:07,101 --> 01:02:07,821
especially at the stage.

2617
01:02:07,821 --> 01:02:10,430
I was then to read the book and
understand what he's trying to say and I,

2618
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:12,380
it's like today I can understand it,

2619
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:16,370
but Michael Colgan made it really
simple for me and he's like,

2620
01:02:16,371 --> 01:02:16,611
look,

2621
01:02:16,611 --> 01:02:18,740
if you want to train
and reach a new level,

2622
01:02:18,830 --> 01:02:19,770
it takes six months.

2623
01:02:19,771 --> 01:02:20,070
This is

2624
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:22,290
the body's natural process.

2625
01:02:22,291 --> 01:02:23,700
So it would be like trying to,

2626
01:02:23,701 --> 01:02:24,180
uh,

2627
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:24,400
you know,

2628
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:27,960
plant a seed in there having
an apple tree in three months.

2629
01:02:27,961 --> 01:02:28,291
Now he says,

2630
01:02:28,291 --> 01:02:28,500
no,

2631
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:30,060
the apple tree grows at a certain rate.

2632
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:33,600
So the human body does
things at a certain rate.

2633
01:02:33,601 --> 01:02:34,470
There's no way around it.

2634
01:02:35,070 --> 01:02:35,761
You need stress,

2635
01:02:35,761 --> 01:02:36,480
you need recovery,

2636
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:37,860
then you add up the adaptation.

2637
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:38,710
Here's the,

2638
01:02:38,710 --> 01:02:40,650
the cycles you have to go
through to reach a new level.

2639
01:02:40,651 --> 01:02:42,150
And it ends with a plyometric cycle.

2640
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:42,931
Not Today.

2641
01:02:42,931 --> 01:02:45,870
I don't really use that system anymore
because I found better ways over the

2642
01:02:45,870 --> 01:02:46,050
years.

2643
01:02:46,050 --> 01:02:47,580
It ends with a plyometric cycle.

2644
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:48,830
Why does it end with a plan?

2645
01:02:49,290 --> 01:02:51,240
You have to hit the speed of your sport.

2646
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:52,560
So for instance,

2647
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:54,390
let's say you do a lot of back squatting.

2648
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:55,801
Okay,

2649
01:02:55,801 --> 01:02:56,071
let's see.

2650
01:02:56,071 --> 01:02:58,110
Do backs one and your numbers
on the back squat go up.

2651
01:02:58,650 --> 01:03:00,300
Do you think that's going to
make you a better fighter?

2652
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:01,680
No.

2653
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:02,010
No.

2654
01:03:02,010 --> 01:03:02,820
Why?

2655
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:03,001
So?

2656
01:03:03,001 --> 01:03:05,400
Why do the squatty cause
it'll make you stronger.

2657
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:06,181
Okay.

2658
01:03:06,181 --> 01:03:08,910
But does it make you stronger
on the field in the octagon?

2659
01:03:09,150 --> 01:03:12,570
It can make you stronger in certain
positions in certain positions.

2660
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:13,380
Yes.

2661
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:17,490
Now I think my question was say it can
make you stronger in certain positions if

2662
01:03:17,491 --> 01:03:20,250
you can apply that force
over a certain time.

2663
01:03:20,910 --> 01:03:22,560
So power and strength
of two different things.

2664
01:03:22,561 --> 01:03:25,500
Pop strength is can you live
that bard weighs 500 pounds.

2665
01:03:25,530 --> 01:03:26,280
You can lift it.

2666
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:27,060
Okay good.

2667
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:30,780
Can you get that by off the ground
and locked out in 1.5 seconds?

2668
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:33,030
That's the question we
want to ask for sports.

2669
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:34,920
How fast can you apply the force?

2670
01:03:34,921 --> 01:03:37,080
That's power force over time.

2671
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:38,220
A strength over time.

2672
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:40,500
So when you want to shoot a double,

2673
01:03:40,501 --> 01:03:41,790
like you have to do it in the window.

2674
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:44,790
So that's why the plyometric phases,

2675
01:03:44,791 --> 01:03:47,290
the last phase is very important that
you need to take all that strength you

2676
01:03:47,291 --> 01:03:50,100
cultivated and translated
to a level of speed.

2677
01:03:51,090 --> 01:03:54,960
So I need George to change level and
explored in a fraction of a second.

2678
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:57,120
So that's why I like
things like sprinting,

2679
01:03:57,121 --> 01:03:57,811
track and field,

2680
01:03:57,811 --> 01:03:58,180
et cetera.

2681
01:03:58,180 --> 01:04:00,570
These are things done in
a short period of time.

2682
01:04:00,571 --> 01:04:01,440
The ground contact,

2683
01:04:01,441 --> 01:04:05,040
the ground force reaction that the time
you spent on the ground applying force

2684
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:05,874
into the ground.

2685
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:07,210
So when you want to apply force on a,

2686
01:04:07,211 --> 01:04:07,681
on a person,

2687
01:04:07,681 --> 01:04:10,830
you first have to apply the force
in the ground and then I ground.

2688
01:04:10,870 --> 01:04:12,990
Then that reaction is applied into the,

2689
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:13,891
into your opponent,

2690
01:04:13,891 --> 01:04:14,041
right?

2691
01:04:14,041 --> 01:04:15,480
So every action has an opposite.

2692
01:04:15,481 --> 01:04:16,314
Equal reaction.

2693
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:17,550
How fast can you apply?

2694
01:04:17,610 --> 01:04:19,050
Apply that force into the ground.

2695
01:04:19,350 --> 01:04:20,071
Now squatters.

2696
01:04:20,071 --> 01:04:24,690
If I take you and I make you squat a slow
squat down and up the I'm treating you

2697
01:04:24,691 --> 01:04:25,560
like a tow truck,

2698
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:26,520
right?

2699
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:27,960
Then I measure your vertical jump.

2700
01:04:27,961 --> 01:04:28,711
You're vertical jumps,

2701
01:04:28,711 --> 01:04:31,680
gonna have gone down after you've
done six months of a squatting,

2702
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:32,910
it's not going to have gone up.

2703
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:33,931
Why?

2704
01:04:33,931 --> 01:04:35,370
Because you're training like a tow truck.

2705
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:36,361
You're telling your body,

2706
01:04:36,361 --> 01:04:36,541
look,

2707
01:04:36,541 --> 01:04:37,560
I need to lift lots of money,

2708
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:39,270
lots of heavyweights in a slow,

2709
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:40,560
in a slow fashion.

2710
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:41,311
However,

2711
01:04:41,311 --> 01:04:44,790
if I make you do plyometrics or I make
you do Olympic lifting and Olympic

2712
01:04:44,791 --> 01:04:45,750
lifting is very fast,

2713
01:04:45,870 --> 01:04:48,180
it's 1.5 second contraction
on the hamstring,

2714
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:49,193
1.5 seconds.

2715
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:50,470
And,

2716
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:52,770
and there's a certain point
where it's 0.5 seconds,

2717
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:54,930
then I make you a test,

2718
01:04:54,931 --> 01:04:56,730
your vertical now your verticals gone up.

2719
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:58,770
So there's an element of speed.

2720
01:04:58,890 --> 01:05:00,450
So Michael Colgan at
the end of the program,

2721
01:05:00,451 --> 01:05:03,900
he does a a four week or
three week phase of the calls.

2722
01:05:03,901 --> 01:05:06,750
It the link cycle where you're
doing plyometrics is very important.

2723
01:05:07,410 --> 01:05:08,400
That's fascinating.

2724
01:05:08,430 --> 01:05:09,750
I've never heard it put that way.

2725
01:05:09,751 --> 01:05:11,070
And I like that thought.

2726
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:12,780
I liked the thought process behind it.

2727
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:14,560
I think there's a,

2728
01:05:14,590 --> 01:05:17,740
there's a lot of people that are
using a lot of plyometric drills now.

2729
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:18,640
Um,

2730
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:19,361
and uh,

2731
01:05:19,361 --> 01:05:24,361
it's way more common when you see like
training montage has of guys hopping over

2732
01:05:24,461 --> 01:05:25,090
hurdles.

2733
01:05:25,090 --> 01:05:28,210
But I really have to think that George
was one of the first guys I ever saw do

2734
01:05:28,211 --> 01:05:28,840
that stuff.

2735
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:29,361
I used to tell him,

2736
01:05:29,361 --> 01:05:31,660
do you want to treat it like a tow truck
or do you want to train like a Ferrari?

2737
01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:34,780
Which one do you want to be
[inaudible] if you look at Damien Maia,

2738
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:35,650
he's like a tow truck.

2739
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:36,723
Yeah,

2740
01:05:36,730 --> 01:05:37,271
he stiff.

2741
01:05:37,271 --> 01:05:38,860
Even when he throws a
punch is a very stiff,

2742
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:39,430
yeah.

2743
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:39,671
Why?

2744
01:05:39,671 --> 01:05:41,110
Because years of gait training,

2745
01:05:41,111 --> 01:05:41,944
it's like,

2746
01:05:42,070 --> 01:05:42,790
yeah,

2747
01:05:42,790 --> 01:05:45,940
I've trained my body to make an isometric
hold and now your built your body

2748
01:05:45,941 --> 01:05:46,330
behaves.

2749
01:05:46,330 --> 01:05:47,163
I symmetrically.

2750
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:49,180
Why you asking you to
do anything different?

2751
01:05:49,690 --> 01:05:52,480
I never ask my body to do something in
practice that I don't want it to do on

2752
01:05:52,481 --> 01:05:53,314
fight night.

2753
01:05:53,570 --> 01:05:55,360
So I do believe squatting is important.

2754
01:05:55,570 --> 01:05:58,900
Squatting's important to
develop a general strength.

2755
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:00,280
So let's say for instance,

2756
01:06:00,281 --> 01:06:01,210
you're always doing plyometrics.

2757
01:06:01,270 --> 01:06:01,451
White,

2758
01:06:01,451 --> 01:06:02,740
you might have an overuse injury,

2759
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:04,510
certain muscles not being activated.

2760
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:05,890
You go on the squat rack,

2761
01:06:05,891 --> 01:06:08,710
you do a few squats and I
believe you've got to do squats.

2762
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:09,700
Um,

2763
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:10,030
not,

2764
01:06:10,030 --> 01:06:10,571
not too heavy,

2765
01:06:10,571 --> 01:06:12,610
about 70% of your Max and do it fast.

2766
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:14,470
You'll still get all the benefits.

2767
01:06:14,710 --> 01:06:16,810
What about lowering it Lauren,

2768
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:19,270
and how do you lower it
fast or do you lower it?

2769
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:20,980
Lower it fast and up fast.

2770
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:21,430
Really?

2771
01:06:21,430 --> 01:06:21,611
Yeah.

2772
01:06:21,611 --> 01:06:22,151
So for instance,

2773
01:06:22,151 --> 01:06:22,930
if Fred had field,

2774
01:06:22,930 --> 01:06:24,250
he's a probably said it best.

2775
01:06:24,310 --> 01:06:24,491
Okay?

2776
01:06:24,491 --> 01:06:27,520
He said he's the first man to
officially squat a thousand pounds.

2777
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:28,571
He said,

2778
01:06:28,571 --> 01:06:29,350
look,

2779
01:06:29,350 --> 01:06:30,130
throw a baseball,

2780
01:06:30,130 --> 01:06:31,750
throw a throw a paper,

2781
01:06:31,870 --> 01:06:32,471
you take a paper,

2782
01:06:32,471 --> 01:06:33,700
you can pull it up and you throw it,

2783
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,340
it's too light for it to,

2784
01:06:35,670 --> 01:06:36,850
to to go anywhere.

2785
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:39,410
You throw it really hard
bit because it's so light.

2786
01:06:39,411 --> 01:06:40,244
That doesn't go anywhere.

2787
01:06:40,570 --> 01:06:42,520
Take a bowling ball or
bowling balls too heavy,

2788
01:06:42,521 --> 01:06:43,570
throw it doesn't go anywhere.

2789
01:06:44,590 --> 01:06:45,490
You take a baseball,

2790
01:06:45,820 --> 01:06:47,440
that's the right amount of resistance.

2791
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:48,730
It's the right amount of weight.

2792
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:50,790
Now you're going to apply
more force on that baseball.

2793
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:52,000
You're gonna get more force out of it.

2794
01:06:52,001 --> 01:06:52,750
Why?

2795
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:53,081
It's the,

2796
01:06:53,081 --> 01:06:54,370
it's in the goldilocks range.

2797
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:55,690
So for instance,

2798
01:06:56,230 --> 01:06:57,063
let's say,

2799
01:06:57,100 --> 01:06:57,940
let's make it really simple.

2800
01:06:57,941 --> 01:06:58,091
Okay?

2801
01:06:58,091 --> 01:06:59,440
Let's see you way zero pounds.

2802
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:00,610
I put you on a scale.

2803
01:07:00,611 --> 01:07:01,540
You weigh zero pounds.

2804
01:07:01,570 --> 01:07:02,620
You have a bar on your back.

2805
01:07:02,650 --> 01:07:04,240
The bar weighs 100 pounds.

2806
01:07:05,050 --> 01:07:05,261
Okay?

2807
01:07:05,261 --> 01:07:06,250
So we're looking at the scale.

2808
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:08,830
Now the scale says 100 pounds,

2809
01:07:09,070 --> 01:07:10,120
the bars on your back.

2810
01:07:10,390 --> 01:07:12,280
Let's take away your weight
just to make it really simple.

2811
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:14,740
You go down and up.

2812
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:16,720
The scale is going to read 101

2813
01:07:18,370 --> 01:07:20,890
that's the minimum amount of
power you have to put into that,

2814
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:23,080
that that scale for it to come up.

2815
01:07:23,770 --> 01:07:27,250
So when you go down the scale is
going to say 100 100 as you come up,

2816
01:07:27,251 --> 01:07:28,300
it's going to say one on one.

2817
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:30,310
For it to have a positive trajectory,

2818
01:07:30,610 --> 01:07:32,920
you have to apply 101 pounds upwards,

2819
01:07:33,810 --> 01:07:34,061
sorry,

2820
01:07:34,061 --> 01:07:34,451
downward.

2821
01:07:34,451 --> 01:07:35,440
And then reaction will be upwards.

2822
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:38,950
If I put that weight on my back,

2823
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,150
if I put 70 pounds,

2824
01:07:40,180 --> 01:07:44,740
if I think 70% of the weight and I go
up and down really fast on the scale,

2825
01:07:44,890 --> 01:07:48,700
the scale is going to read
101 minimum for me to,

2826
01:07:49,510 --> 01:07:51,220
if I explode up really fast,

2827
01:07:51,730 --> 01:07:56,080
it's going to read 100100200 three
now I got the benefits of a maximum

2828
01:07:56,081 --> 01:07:56,914
contraction,

2829
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,620
let's say 100 pounds with
a maximum you can lift,

2830
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:04,300
but I don't have the weight
of a hundred pounds on me.

2831
01:08:04,950 --> 01:08:05,291
You know,

2832
01:08:05,291 --> 01:08:05,770
somebody who,

2833
01:08:05,770 --> 01:08:06,280
who,

2834
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:08,260
who really made this
popular is a Louie Simmons.

2835
01:08:08,261 --> 01:08:09,310
He learned it from the Russians,

2836
01:08:10,150 --> 01:08:10,450
you know,

2837
01:08:10,450 --> 01:08:10,670
said.

2838
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:11,503
Have you had him on your show?

2839
01:08:11,650 --> 01:08:12,070
Yes.

2840
01:08:12,070 --> 01:08:13,060
He's a brilliant trainer.

2841
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:13,963
He's fascinating.

2842
01:08:14,070 --> 01:08:15,920
He's a brilliant human being too.

2843
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:17,150
He's out of his mind.

2844
01:08:17,151 --> 01:08:17,301
We,

2845
01:08:17,301 --> 01:08:19,070
we interviewed an Hermes in his gym.

2846
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:19,701
Really?

2847
01:08:19,701 --> 01:08:19,971
Yeah.

2848
01:08:19,971 --> 01:08:20,540
And uh,

2849
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:21,021
Columbus,

2850
01:08:21,021 --> 01:08:21,620
it was great.

2851
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:23,180
But he's a genius when
it comes to lifting.

2852
01:08:23,330 --> 01:08:23,600
Yeah,

2853
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:24,291
he's a genius.

2854
01:08:24,291 --> 01:08:25,130
He knows what he's talking about.

2855
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:26,080
He read super training.

2856
01:08:26,081 --> 01:08:27,050
I also read super training.

2857
01:08:27,051 --> 01:08:30,950
It's super training is about lowering
the rates to the right amount and doing a

2858
01:08:30,951 --> 01:08:31,820
plyometric with it.

2859
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,430
You get the same benefits
is using maximum weight,

2860
01:08:34,670 --> 01:08:36,170
but you don't get the side effects,

2861
01:08:36,290 --> 01:08:36,981
the soreness,

2862
01:08:36,981 --> 01:08:37,641
the injury,

2863
01:08:37,641 --> 01:08:38,331
the red lining.

2864
01:08:38,331 --> 01:08:39,200
You don't get anything out of that.

2865
01:08:39,230 --> 01:08:43,010
So the Russians found a great way
to apply maximum force on the bar,

2866
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:44,630
but they also get speed.

2867
01:08:44,690 --> 01:08:46,880
They're not training like tow
trucks to training like Ferrari's.

2868
01:08:46,881 --> 01:08:48,470
That's actually where I got
the term from Louie Simmons.

2869
01:08:48,471 --> 01:08:50,000
He really clarified it for me.

2870
01:08:50,001 --> 01:08:50,834
Made it really simple.

2871
01:08:51,350 --> 01:08:56,350
So like what kind of like say if
you could bench press a 315 pounds,

2872
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:57,590
what would you use?

2873
01:08:57,620 --> 01:09:00,560
You use between 65 to 80% of that
weight and it's just real quick,

2874
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:01,733
boom,

2875
01:09:02,190 --> 01:09:02,451
boom.

2876
01:09:02,451 --> 01:09:06,040
You'll get the same amount of resistance
if you do it quickly as if you had the

2877
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:06,874
maximum weight on it.

2878
01:09:07,430 --> 01:09:10,240
So he doesn't use maximum
weight except for once a week.

2879
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:11,480
And the reason why he explains it,

2880
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:12,333
he says,

2881
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:12,801
look,

2882
01:09:12,801 --> 01:09:14,300
you have proprioceptors in your system.

2883
01:09:14,301 --> 01:09:15,230
Proprioceptors is like,

2884
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:17,060
it's what tells you if
your arm is up or down.

2885
01:09:17,090 --> 01:09:18,260
If your arm is bent to your chest,

2886
01:09:18,261 --> 01:09:18,650
if you are,

2887
01:09:18,650 --> 01:09:19,060
if you,

2888
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:20,570
if I close your eyes and I lift your arm,

2889
01:09:20,571 --> 01:09:20,930
you'd be like,

2890
01:09:20,930 --> 01:09:21,763
you're lifted my arm.

2891
01:09:21,770 --> 01:09:21,831
Oh,

2892
01:09:21,831 --> 01:09:22,430
how do you know that?

2893
01:09:22,430 --> 01:09:23,263
Appropriate sectors?

2894
01:09:23,810 --> 01:09:24,141
He says,

2895
01:09:24,141 --> 01:09:24,471
if you,

2896
01:09:24,471 --> 01:09:25,370
if you put on a map,

2897
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:25,761
let's say you,

2898
01:09:25,761 --> 01:09:27,360
let's say you're working with um,

2899
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:29,720
75 pounds and your maximum is a hundred.

2900
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:33,500
When you go to lift that day
and on the competition date,

2901
01:09:33,501 --> 01:09:35,000
when you get a hundred on your bones,

2902
01:09:35,390 --> 01:09:36,081
your buddy's going to be like,

2903
01:09:36,081 --> 01:09:36,914
Hey,

2904
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:38,420
I've never felt that amount of weight.

2905
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:39,080
This is Arthur.

2906
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:39,890
Kinetic reflects,

2907
01:09:39,890 --> 01:09:40,820
shut the muscles down.

2908
01:09:40,821 --> 01:09:41,900
We've never felt that weight.

2909
01:09:42,410 --> 01:09:43,730
This is the narrative that he gives us.

2910
01:09:44,210 --> 01:09:44,511
He says,

2911
01:09:44,511 --> 01:09:45,800
because you've never felt that weight,

2912
01:09:45,830 --> 01:09:46,550
your body's going to,

2913
01:09:46,550 --> 01:09:47,221
it's not going to allow you,

2914
01:09:47,221 --> 01:09:48,710
there's a safety mechanism in your body.

2915
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:49,191
It says,

2916
01:09:49,191 --> 01:09:49,311
look,

2917
01:09:49,311 --> 01:09:49,651
this is,

2918
01:09:49,651 --> 01:09:50,000
this isn't,

2919
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:50,780
we're not used to this.

2920
01:09:50,780 --> 01:09:51,710
Let's not take a chance.

2921
01:09:52,550 --> 01:09:53,030
And he says,

2922
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:54,620
if you get your body used to that,

2923
01:09:55,190 --> 01:09:56,510
the Ortho kinetic reflex will,

2924
01:09:56,511 --> 01:09:58,390
will quiet down and allow you to lift.

2925
01:09:58,640 --> 01:09:58,930
There's,

2926
01:09:58,930 --> 01:10:00,110
there's an inner mechanism,

2927
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:01,670
the safety mechanism in the human body.

2928
01:10:01,671 --> 01:10:02,690
So he says to bypass that,

2929
01:10:03,110 --> 01:10:08,110
we do heavyweights once a week
to two to numb that reflex.

2930
01:10:09,501 --> 01:10:09,651
So,

2931
01:10:09,651 --> 01:10:11,960
but the majority of the
work is done with lightened,

2932
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:12,471
sorry,

2933
01:10:12,471 --> 01:10:13,610
lighter and fast.

2934
01:10:13,670 --> 01:10:14,451
75%,

2935
01:10:14,451 --> 01:10:14,721
let's say.

2936
01:10:14,721 --> 01:10:19,721
What do you think of like Pavel Tot
Selenis principles by the strong first

2937
01:10:20,031 --> 01:10:21,170
principles of the,

2938
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:24,020
like say if you could do 10 reps
of something you don't do 10,

2939
01:10:24,021 --> 01:10:24,854
you do five.

2940
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:25,873
Exactly right.

2941
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:26,931
How'd you percent?

2942
01:10:26,931 --> 01:10:28,910
I've read all of [inaudible] works.

2943
01:10:28,911 --> 01:10:29,520
Almost all of them.

2944
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:32,660
He's brilliant trainer that I agree
with that 100% outside of competition.

2945
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,100
Let's explain it to people.

2946
01:10:34,130 --> 01:10:34,910
Yeah.

2947
01:10:34,910 --> 01:10:35,350
Okay.

2948
01:10:35,350 --> 01:10:35,720
So,

2949
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:35,961
yeah,

2950
01:10:35,961 --> 01:10:36,291
let me,

2951
01:10:36,291 --> 01:10:36,560
uh,

2952
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:36,801
okay.

2953
01:10:36,801 --> 01:10:37,730
So let's say for instance,

2954
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:38,350
let's say,

2955
01:10:38,350 --> 01:10:38,620
you know,

2956
01:10:38,620 --> 01:10:40,430
I'm a big believer never being sore.

2957
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:43,220
You should train the next day
she'd wake up feeling good.

2958
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:44,121
Okay?

2959
01:10:44,121 --> 01:10:44,451
And I'll why,

2960
01:10:44,451 --> 01:10:45,284
how's that possible?

2961
01:10:45,410 --> 01:10:45,591
Well,

2962
01:10:45,591 --> 01:10:46,880
because look,

2963
01:10:46,881 --> 01:10:47,420
if if,

2964
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:47,631
okay,

2965
01:10:47,631 --> 01:10:48,090
that's great.

2966
01:10:48,090 --> 01:10:48,923
That's a great example.

2967
01:10:49,220 --> 01:10:49,791
Let's say,

2968
01:10:49,791 --> 01:10:50,624
um,

2969
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:52,850
let's see your energy levels
as talking about fit people,

2970
01:10:52,851 --> 01:10:53,271
by the way,

2971
01:10:53,271 --> 01:10:53,820
right?

2972
01:10:53,820 --> 01:10:54,591
Every human being,

2973
01:10:54,591 --> 01:10:56,090
every cell guys never worked out before.

2974
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:57,310
First Day first,

2975
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:57,770
they never call.

2976
01:10:57,770 --> 01:11:00,080
Is it possible to work out
and not be so no problem.

2977
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:01,370
Here we go.

2978
01:11:01,370 --> 01:11:06,370
So let's say there's something
called cr rate of perceived exertion.

2979
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:08,150
Okay?

2980
01:11:08,150 --> 01:11:12,350
So let's say I make you do pull ups and
let's say the maximum on of pull ups you

2981
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:14,760
can do the maximum out of bill is 10.

2982
01:11:15,690 --> 01:11:18,630
Let's keep a nice round number
at 11 you couldn't do 11.

2983
01:11:18,631 --> 01:11:19,800
If I put a pointed a gun at you,

2984
01:11:19,801 --> 01:11:20,634
you couldn't do 11.

2985
01:11:23,510 --> 01:11:25,400
Should I make you do 10
pull ups on our workout?

2986
01:11:25,430 --> 01:11:27,350
Now I'm going to make you do five.

2987
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:28,111
Why?

2988
01:11:28,111 --> 01:11:29,660
Because I'm setting you
up to work the next day.

2989
01:11:29,990 --> 01:11:32,250
The next day we're going to do five and
the next day we're going to do another

2990
01:11:32,251 --> 01:11:33,420
five and then we're going to six.

2991
01:11:33,450 --> 01:11:34,770
When six is really easy,

2992
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:37,830
we're going to do seven y if you count,

2993
01:11:37,890 --> 01:11:38,131
if the,

2994
01:11:38,131 --> 01:11:39,750
if you did 10 pull ups on Monday,

2995
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:41,730
you're going to be sore till Thursday.

2996
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:41,971
What's,

2997
01:11:41,971 --> 01:11:42,960
it's really your Max.

2998
01:11:44,070 --> 01:11:46,530
So Thursday you've only done 10
pull ups from Monday to Thursday.

2999
01:11:46,531 --> 01:11:46,881
Volume done,

3000
01:11:46,881 --> 01:11:47,340
10 pull ups.

3001
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:47,551
Me,

3002
01:11:47,551 --> 01:11:48,810
I've been doing five pull ups every day,

3003
01:11:49,230 --> 01:11:50,400
so I'm at 20 pull ups already.

3004
01:11:50,401 --> 01:11:51,270
25 pullups.

3005
01:11:51,990 --> 01:11:54,480
I have more volume than you now.

3006
01:11:54,870 --> 01:11:56,370
If you add up at the end of the year,

3007
01:11:56,371 --> 01:11:57,181
who trained?

3008
01:11:57,181 --> 01:11:59,130
The more I've trained way more than you.

3009
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:01,110
So let's say I go to Jitsu practice.

3010
01:12:01,140 --> 01:12:02,790
I'm doing Jujitsu every single day.

3011
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:03,421
Three rounds,

3012
01:12:03,421 --> 01:12:04,021
five days a week.

3013
01:12:04,021 --> 01:12:05,070
That's 15 rounds.

3014
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:06,780
You go in twice a week,

3015
01:12:06,781 --> 01:12:08,040
but you kill yourself.

3016
01:12:08,041 --> 01:12:09,330
You do five rounds each day you kill,

3017
01:12:09,331 --> 01:12:09,931
you push yourself.

3018
01:12:09,931 --> 01:12:10,531
Those last two rounds,

3019
01:12:10,531 --> 01:12:11,364
you burn yourself out.

3020
01:12:11,730 --> 01:12:14,860
I still did 15 you're at
10 at the end of the year.

3021
01:12:14,861 --> 01:12:16,360
I've done countless rounds more than I am.

3022
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:18,250
I may have had at so much
more training than you.

3023
01:12:18,970 --> 01:12:22,420
So how much training can
we pack in in the week?

3024
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:24,750
That's the real question.

3025
01:12:24,751 --> 01:12:26,850
How much volume can you
expose your athlete too?

3026
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:29,840
So I always tell people look energy as,

3027
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:30,240
sorry,

3028
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:31,800
exercise can produce energy.

3029
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:36,000
So let's say I'm feeling like a seven
out of 10 10 being I'm really like

3030
01:12:36,001 --> 01:12:36,811
energized one.

3031
01:12:36,811 --> 01:12:37,920
I was like really lethargic,

3032
01:12:37,921 --> 01:12:41,640
feeling like I need to lay down
and seven I'm feeling good.

3033
01:12:42,110 --> 01:12:42,720
Okay.

3034
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:46,500
If I get up and I do a
right amount of exercise,

3035
01:12:46,501 --> 01:12:47,250
the right amount,

3036
01:12:47,250 --> 01:12:50,820
I can feel like an 8.5 exercise
can give me a tonic effect,

3037
01:12:50,821 --> 01:12:51,840
like drinking this coffee.

3038
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:53,750
So let's say I just do some jumping jacks.

3039
01:12:53,751 --> 01:12:54,870
It hit the back for a couple of rounds.

3040
01:12:54,871 --> 01:12:55,770
I'm feeling good.

3041
01:12:56,220 --> 01:12:57,090
Once you get that high,

3042
01:12:57,091 --> 01:12:57,924
shut it down.

3043
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:01,070
Don't go into the phase
where your body's beat up,

3044
01:13:01,071 --> 01:13:01,461
tight,

3045
01:13:01,461 --> 01:13:02,240
broken up.

3046
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:03,320
Don't redline the body.

3047
01:13:03,740 --> 01:13:07,910
That's only for training camps
for P for a small period of time.

3048
01:13:07,910 --> 01:13:08,061
Why?

3049
01:13:08,061 --> 01:13:09,980
Because you get a little
bit more from the system,

3050
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:12,440
but in the long run you get less.

3051
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:13,791
In the long run,

3052
01:13:13,791 --> 01:13:14,780
you've tax the system.

3053
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:16,520
So if you do that regularly,

3054
01:13:16,940 --> 01:13:17,990
by the time you actually get good,

3055
01:13:17,991 --> 01:13:18,824
you'll be broken up.

3056
01:13:19,070 --> 01:13:19,460
Mm.

3057
01:13:19,460 --> 01:13:20,580
That's why I do a lot of flow.

3058
01:13:20,581 --> 01:13:21,170
And have you ever,

3059
01:13:21,170 --> 01:13:23,720
have you ever heard of a
Mihai send me high as a,

3060
01:13:23,721 --> 01:13:24,680
a flow?

3061
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:25,810
No.

3062
01:13:25,810 --> 01:13:26,021
Okay.

3063
01:13:26,021 --> 01:13:27,070
So you can you,

3064
01:13:27,130 --> 01:13:27,791
can you Jamie,

3065
01:13:27,791 --> 01:13:28,830
can you look up a flowchart?

3066
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:29,830
It'd be so much simpler.

3067
01:13:30,190 --> 01:13:33,280
Like just put in flow a
flow in the workplace,

3068
01:13:33,281 --> 01:13:33,911
a flow chart.

3069
01:13:33,911 --> 01:13:34,391
This is such,

3070
01:13:34,391 --> 01:13:35,290
this is pure genius.

3071
01:13:35,291 --> 01:13:36,160
This guy is pure genius.

3072
01:13:36,161 --> 01:13:36,431
Basically.

3073
01:13:36,431 --> 01:13:37,630
He went and he,

3074
01:13:37,631 --> 01:13:37,900
uh,

3075
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:38,950
he coined the term flow.

3076
01:13:38,951 --> 01:13:40,150
So like when you're in a state of flow,

3077
01:13:40,151 --> 01:13:41,410
we've all been in a state of flow.

3078
01:13:41,411 --> 01:13:42,244
The number one

3079
01:13:43,810 --> 01:13:45,020
way to know that you're
in a state of flow.

3080
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:46,240
As time flies by,

3081
01:13:46,710 --> 01:13:48,360
I'm sure some somebody you've
done podcasts and you're like,

3082
01:13:48,361 --> 01:13:48,711
what was it,

3083
01:13:48,711 --> 01:13:49,544
three hours already?

3084
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:50,580
It was,

3085
01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:51,780
it was a great podcast.

3086
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:52,321
You know,

3087
01:13:52,321 --> 01:13:54,110
the one where you have
the worst guest or you're,

3088
01:13:54,111 --> 01:13:55,140
you're having the worst workout.

3089
01:13:55,141 --> 01:13:56,670
It feels like every minute is an hour.

3090
01:13:56,990 --> 01:13:57,823
That's a bad,

3091
01:13:57,990 --> 01:13:59,100
you're not in a state of Florida.

3092
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:02,340
State of flow is you're having
the right amount of difficulty,

3093
01:14:02,850 --> 01:14:06,210
but it's not so difficult that you go
into stress and it's not so easy that

3094
01:14:06,211 --> 01:14:06,870
you're bored.

3095
01:14:06,870 --> 01:14:08,220
It's the right amount of challenge.

3096
01:14:08,670 --> 01:14:10,860
So let's see it as simple
as playing it like tetris.

3097
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:12,400
If I put you on a,

3098
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:13,960
if I put you on a level that's too high,

3099
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:15,610
you can be like you're going to
play for five minutes and be like,

3100
01:14:15,611 --> 01:14:16,444
I'm done.

3101
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:18,430
I put you on a level two easy.

3102
01:14:18,431 --> 01:14:18,851
You're going to be like,

3103
01:14:18,851 --> 01:14:19,684
this is boring.

3104
01:14:20,140 --> 01:14:21,660
If I put you on the right amount of level,

3105
01:14:21,661 --> 01:14:22,900
you see that as the flow channel.

3106
01:14:23,740 --> 01:14:25,240
So if the challenge is too high,

3107
01:14:25,241 --> 01:14:26,230
you'll meet anxiety.

3108
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,140
If it's too low,

3109
01:14:29,141 --> 01:14:29,620
your border.

3110
01:14:29,620 --> 01:14:30,730
When I go in the practice room,

3111
01:14:30,731 --> 01:14:31,780
I'm trying to create flow.

3112
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:35,230
I'm having fun at training
should be addictive.

3113
01:14:36,070 --> 01:14:37,300
Imagine training was addictive.

3114
01:14:37,990 --> 01:14:39,430
Everybody would train everybody to be fit,

3115
01:14:39,910 --> 01:14:41,590
but people always go into anxiety.

3116
01:14:41,830 --> 01:14:42,641
They go and they kill.

3117
01:14:42,641 --> 01:14:43,690
They're slammed their body.

3118
01:14:43,930 --> 01:14:45,940
Then I have to convince you to
do it again three days later,

3119
01:14:45,941 --> 01:14:46,481
two days later,

3120
01:14:46,481 --> 01:14:46,811
and you're like,

3121
01:14:46,811 --> 01:14:47,644
dude,

3122
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:49,630
the mental energy is going
to take me to get there.

3123
01:14:49,631 --> 01:14:51,100
Like it shouldn't be.

3124
01:14:51,101 --> 01:14:51,934
It should be.

3125
01:14:52,060 --> 01:14:53,680
Training should be a pulling force.

3126
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:54,551
It should be pulling you.

3127
01:14:54,551 --> 01:14:55,630
You want to go training.

3128
01:14:55,990 --> 01:14:57,190
If you don't want to go train it,

3129
01:14:57,191 --> 01:14:57,761
it's not fun.

3130
01:14:57,761 --> 01:14:58,361
If it's not fun,

3131
01:14:58,361 --> 01:14:59,194
you're not gonna do a lot of it.

3132
01:14:59,980 --> 01:15:01,000
And if you're not going to do a lot of it,

3133
01:15:01,001 --> 01:15:02,080
you're never going to reach mastery.

3134
01:15:02,230 --> 01:15:03,610
So how do I make it pleasurable?

3135
01:15:03,611 --> 01:15:04,444
How to make it fun?

3136
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:07,780
I have to be in a flow state and you
can get into a flow state in almost

3137
01:15:07,781 --> 01:15:08,614
anything.

3138
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:09,820
But when you're out of that flow state,

3139
01:15:09,850 --> 01:15:10,683
cut it.

3140
01:15:11,290 --> 01:15:12,580
We're going to get further.

3141
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:16,210
We're going to do more training if we
cut it today and come back in tomorrow.

3142
01:15:16,211 --> 01:15:19,420
Cause I'm a big believer in
consistency over intensity.

3143
01:15:20,380 --> 01:15:23,260
Intensity should be done one in a
once in a while because by nature,

3144
01:15:23,261 --> 01:15:25,690
intensity can only be
done once in a while.

3145
01:15:25,930 --> 01:15:26,950
If you're going hard every day,

3146
01:15:26,951 --> 01:15:28,150
you're not really going hard every day.

3147
01:15:28,330 --> 01:15:29,680
You can't go your Max everyday.

3148
01:15:29,740 --> 01:15:29,981
There's a,

3149
01:15:29,981 --> 01:15:30,371
there's a,

3150
01:15:30,371 --> 01:15:32,320
there's a cost to going to your Max.

3151
01:15:32,890 --> 01:15:35,980
Can you sprint every single day and
you cannot sprint every single day.

3152
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:36,813
It's ludicrous.

3153
01:15:36,940 --> 01:15:38,170
You could sprint once or twice a week.

3154
01:15:38,171 --> 01:15:40,030
The best sprinters in the world
is print once or twice a week.

3155
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:45,300
Nobody's sprints every day
because intensity by nature
entails that you need to

3156
01:15:45,601 --> 01:15:48,040
take a break because if you
don't need to take a break,

3157
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:49,870
you didn't really go to
your maximum intensity.

3158
01:15:50,170 --> 01:15:52,060
If you lift your maximum lift,

3159
01:15:52,570 --> 01:15:53,890
the maximum amount of reps you can,

3160
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:55,780
the maximum weight you can lift.

3161
01:15:56,290 --> 01:15:58,090
If you do two reps that was in your Max,

3162
01:15:59,530 --> 01:16:01,810
because if it was you wouldn't
have have a second revenue.

3163
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:05,230
Understand what would have to give
you a break for you have a second rep.

3164
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:07,480
So we didn't find your true Max.

3165
01:16:07,481 --> 01:16:08,020
Right?

3166
01:16:08,020 --> 01:16:12,610
Intensity maximum effort entails you
have to stop because it's the maximum.

3167
01:16:13,180 --> 01:16:14,350
There was no more reserves.

3168
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:15,120
There are no more reserve.

3169
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:17,080
So what do you think about
people that they'd say,

3170
01:16:17,081 --> 01:16:18,580
there's no such news overturning.

3171
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:21,500
Here's the John Denver,

3172
01:16:21,501 --> 01:16:22,790
our narrative and that I'll add.

3173
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:25,030
And he said he coins it really,

3174
01:16:25,031 --> 01:16:25,481
really well.

3175
01:16:25,481 --> 01:16:25,751
He says,

3176
01:16:25,751 --> 01:16:26,290
look,

3177
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:27,400
it's under arrest.

3178
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:29,261
So he says,

3179
01:16:29,261 --> 01:16:29,441
look,

3180
01:16:29,441 --> 01:16:31,870
you can overtrain if you didn't
give your body the rest later.

3181
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:32,680
Yeah.

3182
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:33,131
But he says,

3183
01:16:33,131 --> 01:16:33,610
look,

3184
01:16:33,610 --> 01:16:35,470
no matter how hard I push in practice,

3185
01:16:35,471 --> 01:16:36,640
if I didn't kill myself,

3186
01:16:37,270 --> 01:16:38,081
I can rest from it.

3187
01:16:38,081 --> 01:16:40,390
Then recover and have
super comp compensation.

3188
01:16:40,570 --> 01:16:41,403
I agree with that.

3189
01:16:41,530 --> 01:16:45,550
Some guys have made great strides
with just mental fortitude and mental

3190
01:16:45,551 --> 01:16:46,060
strength.

3191
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:47,830
Overtrained the shit out of themselves.

3192
01:16:47,860 --> 01:16:48,161
Okay,

3193
01:16:48,161 --> 01:16:48,994
but can I ask you this?

3194
01:16:49,030 --> 01:16:49,810
Yes.

3195
01:16:49,810 --> 01:16:50,531
They were successful.

3196
01:16:50,531 --> 01:16:50,790
Yeah.

3197
01:16:50,790 --> 01:16:51,160
Yeah.

3198
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:52,450
But their body's breakdown,

3199
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:52,900
right?

3200
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:53,591
But they could,

3201
01:16:53,591 --> 01:16:56,350
could they have been
better if they used flow?

3202
01:16:56,410 --> 01:16:58,600
Exactly as good as I say,

3203
01:16:58,660 --> 01:17:00,010
Dan Gable for exempt,

3204
01:17:00,011 --> 01:17:00,131
right?

3205
01:17:00,131 --> 01:17:00,940
Example,

3206
01:17:00,940 --> 01:17:04,570
like w Dan Gable essentially
was done in his twenties right?

3207
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:05,351
In terms of like,

3208
01:17:05,351 --> 01:17:06,700
his body's broken down.

3209
01:17:06,730 --> 01:17:07,181
Exactly.

3210
01:17:07,181 --> 01:17:08,080
Knee replacements,

3211
01:17:08,081 --> 01:17:09,010
hip replacements,

3212
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:10,033
that kind of deal.

3213
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:10,760
Let me ask you this.

3214
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:11,630
Who Wins more often?

3215
01:17:11,631 --> 01:17:13,820
Russians or American wrestlers rations.

3216
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:15,530
Every time an American wrestler wins.

3217
01:17:15,531 --> 01:17:17,090
He's like some pro prodigy.

3218
01:17:17,570 --> 01:17:18,080
He's rare.

3219
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:18,411
It's rare.

3220
01:17:18,411 --> 01:17:19,010
It does happen,

3221
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:20,540
but it's rarely is a technical master,

3222
01:17:20,870 --> 01:17:21,230
right?

3223
01:17:21,230 --> 01:17:21,591
However,

3224
01:17:21,591 --> 01:17:23,150
you have these Russian
guys that win gold medals,

3225
01:17:23,151 --> 01:17:25,670
you've never heard of them and they're
like Michael Jordan's of the sport.

3226
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:27,290
There's just so many of them.

3227
01:17:28,190 --> 01:17:31,460
They train long consistent practices.

3228
01:17:31,461 --> 01:17:33,290
Whereas in America we do Monday,

3229
01:17:33,290 --> 01:17:33,290
Wednesday,

3230
01:17:33,290 --> 01:17:33,291
Friday,

3231
01:17:33,291 --> 01:17:33,771
hard,

3232
01:17:33,771 --> 01:17:35,930
we kill it and then you
rest use your Thursday.

3233
01:17:36,710 --> 01:17:40,100
The Eastern Block had a totally different
understanding there like it's volume,

3234
01:17:40,101 --> 01:17:40,431
volume,

3235
01:17:40,431 --> 01:17:41,750
volume near the fight,

3236
01:17:42,010 --> 01:17:43,190
short and intense.

3237
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:45,230
Only near the the competition phase,

3238
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:48,110
but before that it's the
maximum amount of volume.

3239
01:17:48,111 --> 01:17:51,050
You can imagine me and you
were or where to athletes a,

3240
01:17:51,051 --> 01:17:51,291
and B,

3241
01:17:51,291 --> 01:17:52,124
your a and B,

3242
01:17:52,550 --> 01:17:53,900
you're training Jujitsu
three times a week.

3243
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:54,171
Really,

3244
01:17:54,171 --> 01:17:55,004
really hard.

3245
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:56,810
You're going all out.

3246
01:17:56,990 --> 01:17:58,640
I'm training Jiu Jitsu every single day.

3247
01:17:59,450 --> 01:18:00,920
My average practice is two hours.

3248
01:18:01,220 --> 01:18:02,570
Your average practice is two hours,

3249
01:18:02,571 --> 01:18:03,231
but when you go in,

3250
01:18:03,231 --> 01:18:04,220
you kill it like you,

3251
01:18:04,250 --> 01:18:05,000
you go,

3252
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,740
you go with all the black
belts and you kill it.

3253
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:08,690
At the end of the year.

3254
01:18:09,050 --> 01:18:12,350
I'm averaging three practices
are two practices more than you.

3255
01:18:12,380 --> 01:18:15,020
So I've had a hundred practices more
than you by the end of the year,

3256
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:16,480
104 practice.

3257
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,170
Let's give two weeks for vacation.

3258
01:18:18,530 --> 01:18:22,460
Hundred practices more than you to 100
hours more than you had been training.

3259
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:23,600
When we roll,

3260
01:18:23,630 --> 01:18:26,150
your intensity that you put on
the mat is going to be irrelevant.

3261
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:26,301
Why?

3262
01:18:26,301 --> 01:18:28,640
Cause I've also tasted that
intensity periodically.

3263
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:30,560
It's not that much of a factor.

3264
01:18:30,561 --> 01:18:32,930
Now when you go super aggressive on me,

3265
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:34,340
when you talk me aggressively,

3266
01:18:34,670 --> 01:18:36,590
I have felt that I know
how to deal with it.

3267
01:18:36,770 --> 01:18:40,610
Plus I have an extra hundred hours on
you 200 hours so I'm going to mangle you.

3268
01:18:40,990 --> 01:18:41,823
You know what I'm saying?

3269
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:44,750
The volume is far more
important than the intensity.

3270
01:18:45,530 --> 01:18:47,030
The intensity by nature is neat,

3271
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:48,920
is neat to be done periodically.

3272
01:18:50,030 --> 01:18:51,440
If you do everyday it's light intensity.

3273
01:18:51,620 --> 01:18:52,810
So how the Russians is,

3274
01:18:52,820 --> 01:18:53,990
how do they structure their training?

3275
01:18:54,170 --> 01:18:55,190
They're more playful,

3276
01:18:55,490 --> 01:18:55,731
you know,

3277
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:56,564
they kind of like,

3278
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:57,590
they kind of warm up,

3279
01:18:57,591 --> 01:18:58,251
they kind of float all.

3280
01:18:58,251 --> 01:18:58,851
They kind of like,

3281
01:18:58,851 --> 01:18:59,720
they do a lot of technique,

3282
01:18:59,721 --> 01:19:00,680
high emphasis on technique.

3283
01:19:00,681 --> 01:19:01,880
Now a lot of people hearing
this are gonna be like,

3284
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:02,331
well,

3285
01:19:02,331 --> 01:19:03,890
the Russians also are
funded by their government.

3286
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:07,340
Their government supports them a
lot more than maybe an American,

3287
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:08,210
a wrestler.

3288
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:08,781
Okay.

3289
01:19:08,781 --> 01:19:09,351
I agree with that.

3290
01:19:09,351 --> 01:19:10,184
There are many factors,

3291
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:10,790
however,

3292
01:19:10,790 --> 01:19:14,380
we can't deny that they're
technically hates it,

3293
01:19:14,381 --> 01:19:15,141
the word superior,

3294
01:19:15,141 --> 01:19:16,430
but they're technically more advanced.

3295
01:19:16,431 --> 01:19:17,660
Technically when it comes to wrestling,

3296
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:19,580
they have a more of a flow understanding.

3297
01:19:19,590 --> 01:19:20,660
They play around in it and it,

3298
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:21,410
and,

3299
01:19:21,410 --> 01:19:22,910
and the practice gets
more and more intense,

3300
01:19:22,911 --> 01:19:23,744
more and more intense.

3301
01:19:23,780 --> 01:19:24,800
Until you see them going really,

3302
01:19:24,801 --> 01:19:25,251
really hard.

3303
01:19:25,251 --> 01:19:25,881
They're going live,

3304
01:19:25,881 --> 01:19:26,390
you know,

3305
01:19:26,390 --> 01:19:27,051
they're going to really,

3306
01:19:27,051 --> 01:19:27,501
really rough,

3307
01:19:27,501 --> 01:19:29,270
but they were playing to
have a more playful attitude.

3308
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:30,440
Look at the Cubans.

3309
01:19:30,590 --> 01:19:32,360
You ever see Cubans aspiring,

3310
01:19:33,130 --> 01:19:34,190
they're like 50 guys in the room.

3311
01:19:34,191 --> 01:19:34,941
They're just touch boring.

3312
01:19:34,941 --> 01:19:35,930
There's no head gear.

3313
01:19:35,940 --> 01:19:37,040
There's no mat on the floor.

3314
01:19:37,041 --> 01:19:38,360
They're literally sparring on concrete.

3315
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:39,950
You think they're really
trying to drop each other?

3316
01:19:39,951 --> 01:19:40,784
They're on concrete.

3317
01:19:41,150 --> 01:19:41,720
I mean,

3318
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:44,240
the Cubans are the top boxers.

3319
01:19:44,450 --> 01:19:45,890
They're consistently win gold medals.

3320
01:19:46,220 --> 01:19:47,390
But in practice from their playful,

3321
01:19:47,391 --> 01:19:47,931
nobody gets hurt.

3322
01:19:47,931 --> 01:19:48,920
Like you're saying the ties,

3323
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:49,960
ties or just if,

3324
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:51,080
if you go in there and you,

3325
01:19:51,140 --> 01:19:52,220
and you kick a tire really hard,

3326
01:19:52,221 --> 01:19:53,180
he won't spar with you anymore.

3327
01:19:53,630 --> 01:19:53,961
He was like,

3328
01:19:53,961 --> 01:19:55,220
this guy's tools to amateur.

3329
01:19:55,990 --> 01:19:56,823
Hmm.

3330
01:19:56,990 --> 01:19:58,490
There's a time and place for intensity.

3331
01:19:58,491 --> 01:19:59,480
I'm not anti intensity.

3332
01:19:59,481 --> 01:20:02,660
I think that there's a time and place
like Angelo Dundee was probably arguably

3333
01:20:02,661 --> 01:20:03,950
the greatest boxing trainer in history.

3334
01:20:04,370 --> 01:20:04,701
He says,

3335
01:20:04,701 --> 01:20:05,150
look,

3336
01:20:05,150 --> 01:20:07,590
fighting's for fight night in practice,

3337
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:08,190
it's only

3338
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:09,023
practice.

3339
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:12,510
George Saint Pierre has that attitude and
I think that's why he's so good and so

3340
01:20:12,511 --> 01:20:13,440
healthy today.

3341
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:14,491
You know,

3342
01:20:14,491 --> 01:20:15,840
because he never hurts
a sparring partners.

3343
01:20:15,841 --> 01:20:17,130
People line up to one a spar with him.

3344
01:20:17,370 --> 01:20:18,360
It's a joy to spar with them.

3345
01:20:19,530 --> 01:20:19,801
Yeah.

3346
01:20:19,801 --> 01:20:20,160
I,

3347
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:22,350
I love this idea and
I'd love this approach.

3348
01:20:22,410 --> 01:20:23,161
I think that,

3349
01:20:23,161 --> 01:20:23,994
um,

3350
01:20:24,270 --> 01:20:24,720
we,

3351
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:28,050
we have this attitude that you have to
be tough and we have this attitude that

3352
01:20:28,051 --> 01:20:28,890
you have to work hard.

3353
01:20:28,891 --> 01:20:29,724
And uh,

3354
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:30,421
I mean,

3355
01:20:30,421 --> 01:20:31,770
I've fallen prey to that many,

3356
01:20:31,771 --> 01:20:32,880
many times in my life.

3357
01:20:33,150 --> 01:20:34,290
Or you just gotta be tougher.

3358
01:20:34,291 --> 01:20:35,160
You got to work out harder.

3359
01:20:35,161 --> 01:20:36,030
You got to push harder,

3360
01:20:36,750 --> 01:20:39,300
but when I read Pavel stuff,

3361
01:20:39,301 --> 01:20:41,790
one of the first things
that struck me is like,

3362
01:20:41,791 --> 01:20:42,181
well yeah,

3363
01:20:42,181 --> 01:20:42,811
of course.

3364
01:20:42,811 --> 01:20:47,120
If you just do five reps every
day and then you won't be sore,

3365
01:20:47,130 --> 01:20:49,170
you could do it more
often and then your body,

3366
01:20:49,171 --> 01:20:50,460
like you get farmer strength.

3367
01:20:50,730 --> 01:20:52,640
Exactly where it's farmer
strength come from farmers.

3368
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:54,390
They're not going to exhaustion.

3369
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:55,201
Oh you know,

3370
01:20:55,201 --> 01:20:57,620
they're not throwing hail big bales,

3371
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:59,910
Hay Bales to the point where
you know they literally,

3372
01:20:59,911 --> 01:21:02,640
they're heaving and they'll put their
hands and knees and like come on five

3373
01:21:02,641 --> 01:21:03,474
more.

3374
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:05,250
You should never be solar.

3375
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:06,271
If you're sore,

3376
01:21:06,271 --> 01:21:07,050
you over did it.

3377
01:21:07,050 --> 01:21:07,680
Whoa.

3378
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:08,910
Cause I can't train the next day.

3379
01:21:08,911 --> 01:21:09,520
If I'm sore,

3380
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:11,610
I open the wound every time I work out.

3381
01:21:11,611 --> 01:21:12,930
Then with that I said,

3382
01:21:12,931 --> 01:21:13,764
I've overdone it.

3383
01:21:13,990 --> 01:21:14,850
Worked out to you.

3384
01:21:14,851 --> 01:21:15,684
They have,

3385
01:21:16,310 --> 01:21:16,891
you may have,

3386
01:21:16,891 --> 01:21:17,640
you got to,

3387
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:18,990
there's a lot of people
listening to this right now.

3388
01:21:19,110 --> 01:21:19,943
I'll wait a minute.

3389
01:21:21,030 --> 01:21:24,690
How the fuck make your workouts a
seven out of 10 and do them every day?

3390
01:21:25,110 --> 01:21:26,730
You're going to get far
more training hours.

3391
01:21:26,731 --> 01:21:27,720
You're going to spike your mat.

3392
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:29,790
You're going to spike your
metabolism far more often,

3393
01:21:30,450 --> 01:21:31,380
your energy levels,

3394
01:21:31,381 --> 01:21:33,240
your mood is going to be far more,

3395
01:21:33,270 --> 01:21:34,030
uh,

3396
01:21:34,030 --> 01:21:34,350
uh,

3397
01:21:34,350 --> 01:21:35,550
up and,

3398
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:38,250
and training is going
to be more addictive.

3399
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:38,581
Now,

3400
01:21:38,581 --> 01:21:40,620
what kind of training
do you do at this stage?

3401
01:21:40,621 --> 01:21:41,760
Like you're not competing,

3402
01:21:41,910 --> 01:21:45,160
but you're constantly in their sparring
with guys who are professionals and

3403
01:21:45,161 --> 01:21:46,320
you're constantly training them.

3404
01:21:46,530 --> 01:21:47,880
Like what kind of stuff do you do?

3405
01:21:48,090 --> 01:21:48,570
Um,

3406
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:49,810
I do Jujitsu,

3407
01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:50,660
wrestling,

3408
01:21:50,660 --> 01:21:52,590
Moitai and a small amount of conditioning.

3409
01:21:52,591 --> 01:21:53,730
After practice I'll do,

3410
01:21:53,790 --> 01:21:54,091
I,

3411
01:21:54,091 --> 01:21:54,924
I'm too bored.

3412
01:21:54,990 --> 01:21:58,590
I find jumping hurdles and throwing it
like we're doing the weights and stuff.

3413
01:21:59,160 --> 01:21:59,731
Me Personally,

3414
01:21:59,731 --> 01:22:00,680
I don't find that as enjoy.

3415
01:22:00,790 --> 01:22:02,400
I don't have to take that
much enjoyment of it.

3416
01:22:02,401 --> 01:22:05,220
I can do five to 20 minutes in a practice.

3417
01:22:05,250 --> 01:22:07,320
Isn't that because barring is just so fun,

3418
01:22:07,350 --> 01:22:08,040
so much fun.

3419
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:08,821
I'm in a flow state.

3420
01:22:08,821 --> 01:22:09,511
We're having fun.

3421
01:22:09,511 --> 01:22:09,790
You know,

3422
01:22:09,790 --> 01:22:11,670
we're wrestling with I think condition.

3423
01:22:11,671 --> 01:22:12,331
You can't get away with it.

3424
01:22:12,331 --> 01:22:13,140
You need it.

3425
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:13,450
He needed,

3426
01:22:13,450 --> 01:22:15,900
and we've got to talk about what George
was saying on your podcast that he

3427
01:22:15,901 --> 01:22:17,050
doesn't do strength and
conditioning and there's,

3428
01:22:17,051 --> 01:22:18,150
there's a language issue there.

3429
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:21,900
It doesn't think and what we gotta talk
about that because we've done tremendous

3430
01:22:21,901 --> 01:22:23,160
amounts of strength and conditioning.

3431
01:22:23,161 --> 01:22:25,470
Me and George like
tremendous like barrels full.

3432
01:22:25,530 --> 01:22:26,190
Okay.

3433
01:22:26,190 --> 01:22:26,760
And uh,

3434
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:28,080
but he has a different definition.

3435
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:28,261
He,

3436
01:22:28,261 --> 01:22:29,190
there's a misunderstanding.

3437
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:29,671
Okay.

3438
01:22:29,671 --> 01:22:31,140
So I really want to clarify that,

3439
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:33,140
but me personally,

3440
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:35,760
if we roll for an hour
for me to pass like this,

3441
01:22:36,390 --> 01:22:37,170
cause it's so fun.

3442
01:22:37,170 --> 01:22:37,771
It's so fun.

3443
01:22:37,771 --> 01:22:38,371
We're having a good time.

3444
01:22:38,371 --> 01:22:39,181
I'm fascinated.

3445
01:22:39,181 --> 01:22:39,751
I'm fascinated.

3446
01:22:39,751 --> 01:22:40,850
Like you grabbed it like this.

3447
01:22:40,990 --> 01:22:41,340
I like,

3448
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:42,360
I'm always learning new things,

3449
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:43,050
right?

3450
01:22:43,050 --> 01:22:43,740
Um,

3451
01:22:43,740 --> 01:22:45,930
to the swing a kettle bell to do push ups,

3452
01:22:45,931 --> 01:22:46,290
pull ups.

3453
01:22:46,290 --> 01:22:48,120
I can only do that for
a finite amount of time.

3454
01:22:48,121 --> 01:22:48,940
So I'll put a timer,

3455
01:22:48,940 --> 01:22:49,411
three rounds,

3456
01:22:49,411 --> 01:22:52,170
two minutes and I'm doing it and
I bite the bullet and I do it.

3457
01:22:52,171 --> 01:22:53,004
That keeps me healthy.

3458
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:55,260
But I don't go in
practice to just do that.

3459
01:22:55,290 --> 01:22:56,123
That I never do.

3460
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:58,170
It's always after my workout.

3461
01:22:58,171 --> 01:22:59,004
After I do Jujitsu.

3462
01:22:59,030 --> 01:22:59,140
You,

3463
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:00,870
you'll never have a day where you say,

3464
01:23:00,871 --> 01:23:02,640
today I'm going to do Olympic lifting.

3465
01:23:02,790 --> 01:23:02,911
No,

3466
01:23:02,911 --> 01:23:05,650
I don't think Muhammad Ali
ever done Mohammed Ali,

3467
01:23:05,740 --> 01:23:06,220
never

3468
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:07,480
he box and they needed this.

3469
01:23:07,481 --> 01:23:08,101
Conditioning me.

3470
01:23:08,101 --> 01:23:09,040
Whether it does this conditioning,

3471
01:23:09,041 --> 01:23:09,874
then he boxes.

3472
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:11,230
The aid always came together.

3473
01:23:11,231 --> 01:23:11,800
Why?

3474
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:12,551
When I go to the gym,

3475
01:23:12,551 --> 01:23:13,390
I'm going to go to have fun,

3476
01:23:13,570 --> 01:23:14,770
I'm going to go wrestle,

3477
01:23:15,070 --> 01:23:15,791
I'm going to go box,

3478
01:23:15,791 --> 01:23:18,160
I'm going to have a blast and I'm
going to grab the kettle bell.

3479
01:23:18,370 --> 01:23:19,540
I'm going to do a few presses,

3480
01:23:19,541 --> 01:23:23,380
I'm going to do a few Turkish getups
and I'm done because I need to have some

3481
01:23:23,381 --> 01:23:24,101
general fitness.

3482
01:23:24,101 --> 01:23:24,911
You have general fitness,

3483
01:23:24,911 --> 01:23:26,170
then you have specific fitness.

3484
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:28,960
Specific fitness is to
get better at my sport.

3485
01:23:29,230 --> 01:23:31,000
General fitness to keep me healthy,

3486
01:23:31,270 --> 01:23:36,270
strong and allow me to reach new levels
of athleticism that later in longterm

3487
01:23:36,340 --> 01:23:37,900
can translate to my sport later.

3488
01:23:38,770 --> 01:23:40,270
But if you just do your sport,

3489
01:23:40,271 --> 01:23:41,104
in my opinion,

3490
01:23:41,170 --> 01:23:42,250
your system's going to break down,

3491
01:23:42,251 --> 01:23:43,150
your back's gonna break down,

3492
01:23:43,151 --> 01:23:43,990
your knees going to break down,

3493
01:23:43,991 --> 01:23:45,100
your shoulders going to break down.

3494
01:23:45,460 --> 01:23:49,330
You need to stimulate certain muscles
that are not getting stimulation in your

3495
01:23:49,331 --> 01:23:50,320
specific sport.

3496
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:53,710
You create atrophy and certain
muscles cause you're not using them.

3497
01:23:53,711 --> 01:23:56,350
Really I need to work my stabilizers.

3498
01:23:56,351 --> 01:23:57,330
I need to swing the Kettlebell,

3499
01:23:57,370 --> 01:23:58,061
I need to squat,

3500
01:23:58,061 --> 01:24:00,040
I need to do certain exercises.

3501
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:00,701
Like what are the,

3502
01:24:00,701 --> 01:24:01,960
what are their standard course?

3503
01:24:01,980 --> 01:24:03,260
Kettle bells for.

3504
01:24:03,430 --> 01:24:05,290
Is that like triple
extension is number one.

3505
01:24:05,291 --> 01:24:06,730
So any type of squatting maneuver.

3506
01:24:06,731 --> 01:24:08,050
I don't particularly use the squat.

3507
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:09,110
I like to use extension.

3508
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:09,821
Triple extension.

3509
01:24:09,821 --> 01:24:10,660
So your knee,

3510
01:24:10,661 --> 01:24:13,180
hip and ankle are bending
also like a squat,

3511
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:13,691
your knee,

3512
01:24:13,691 --> 01:24:14,530
hip and ankle or Benny.

3513
01:24:14,980 --> 01:24:15,730
I like to jump.

3514
01:24:15,730 --> 01:24:17,920
I like to throw the Med
ball a lot against the wall.

3515
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:19,390
I like to do a hurdles.

3516
01:24:19,391 --> 01:24:20,410
I can do box jumps.

3517
01:24:20,411 --> 01:24:22,690
I like to very low impact parametrics.

3518
01:24:22,691 --> 01:24:23,471
I like sprinting.

3519
01:24:23,471 --> 01:24:24,340
Sprinting is huge.

3520
01:24:24,730 --> 01:24:25,720
You ever do the be test?

3521
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:26,740
What's that?

3522
01:24:26,740 --> 01:24:27,530
Oh you got,

3523
01:24:27,530 --> 01:24:28,810
you got the space for the beep test here.

3524
01:24:28,811 --> 01:24:29,531
You've got to implement.

3525
01:24:29,531 --> 01:24:30,850
What it does is the best way to do cardio.

3526
01:24:31,170 --> 01:24:31,731
You ever hear the,

3527
01:24:31,731 --> 01:24:32,710
the soccer players uses a lot.

3528
01:24:32,711 --> 01:24:33,130
It's a beat,

3529
01:24:33,130 --> 01:24:33,311
right?

3530
01:24:33,311 --> 01:24:33,670
You run,

3531
01:24:33,670 --> 01:24:35,140
you beep and then it beeps back.

3532
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:36,760
And the faster the beeps go,

3533
01:24:36,761 --> 01:24:37,630
the faster you have to run.

3534
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:38,500
Ah,

3535
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:41,080
that's really amazing because what I
do is I set a timer for five minutes.

3536
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:42,490
I put it on a high pace,

3537
01:24:42,491 --> 01:24:45,610
like I'll put a 10 or 11 and
I'll just shuttle back and forth.

3538
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:46,211
And it keeps,

3539
01:24:46,211 --> 01:24:48,130
it tells you how fast to run to beat test.

3540
01:24:48,850 --> 01:24:50,170
And some days I'll feel really good.

3541
01:24:50,171 --> 01:24:54,280
I'll do 11 cause I know how fast I have
to run to keep up with the beats and

3542
01:24:54,281 --> 01:24:54,850
that just,

3543
01:24:54,850 --> 01:24:55,840
it's amazing for cardio.

3544
01:24:55,841 --> 01:24:56,351
It's short,

3545
01:24:56,351 --> 01:24:56,711
sweet,

3546
01:24:56,711 --> 01:24:57,544
painless,

3547
01:24:58,630 --> 01:24:58,991
and it's,

3548
01:24:58,991 --> 01:24:59,681
it's very,

3549
01:24:59,681 --> 01:25:00,010
uh,

3550
01:25:00,010 --> 01:25:01,510
it translates very well to sports.

3551
01:25:01,740 --> 01:25:04,510
Do you do to Bottas do you ever
do tabata bottles are good?

3552
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:05,050
Yeah,

3553
01:25:05,050 --> 01:25:05,890
I think tomatoes are good.

3554
01:25:05,950 --> 01:25:06,890
If they're done well,

3555
01:25:07,110 --> 01:25:07,511
they're good.

3556
01:25:07,511 --> 01:25:07,811
But again,

3557
01:25:07,811 --> 01:25:10,690
you have to do it in a way it doesn't
create soreness cause Tabata can create

3558
01:25:10,691 --> 01:25:11,081
soreness.

3559
01:25:11,081 --> 01:25:11,531
You have to be very,

3560
01:25:11,531 --> 01:25:13,030
I wouldn't do Tabata Kettlebell swing,

3561
01:25:13,031 --> 01:25:13,570
that'll,

3562
01:25:13,570 --> 01:25:14,530
that'll cook my,

3563
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:15,693
my hamstrings.

3564
01:25:15,850 --> 01:25:17,230
I'll probably do like hurdle jump.

3565
01:25:17,620 --> 01:25:20,620
Like you take a small hurdle
hurdle over it for 20 seconds.

3566
01:25:20,860 --> 01:25:21,011
Now,

3567
01:25:21,011 --> 01:25:22,180
what you're saying though,

3568
01:25:22,210 --> 01:25:24,880
like there's gotta be a bunch of crossfit
people out there right now that a

3569
01:25:24,890 --> 01:25:25,990
screaming into their phones,

3570
01:25:26,020 --> 01:25:26,650
they're wrong.

3571
01:25:26,650 --> 01:25:27,483
All the respect,

3572
01:25:28,060 --> 01:25:28,620
the wrong.

3573
01:25:28,620 --> 01:25:30,820
I can say all due respect
with all the respect,

3574
01:25:30,821 --> 01:25:31,071
the wrong.

3575
01:25:31,071 --> 01:25:31,870
Let me tell you why.

3576
01:25:31,870 --> 01:25:32,170
Okay.

3577
01:25:32,170 --> 01:25:32,860
And then look,

3578
01:25:32,860 --> 01:25:33,611
if you like crossfit,

3579
01:25:33,611 --> 01:25:34,960
do with whatever motivates you to do it.

3580
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:35,620
Okay,

3581
01:25:35,620 --> 01:25:37,510
cross its problem is it's fatigue seeking.

3582
01:25:38,410 --> 01:25:39,100
Yes.

3583
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:39,401
It says,

3584
01:25:39,401 --> 01:25:39,551
look,

3585
01:25:39,551 --> 01:25:40,600
go out there and burn yourself out.

3586
01:25:41,020 --> 01:25:41,890
That's totally wrong.

3587
01:25:42,250 --> 01:25:43,510
They're not building any skill.

3588
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:48,540
Try to show me a guy who a champion of
crossfit champion and digital they got

3589
01:25:48,541 --> 01:25:49,820
would need two lifetimes to read.

3590
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:51,190
Which mastery in both of those.

3591
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:52,413
Why?

3592
01:25:52,420 --> 01:25:55,030
Because my crossfit workout
is going to tax me so much.

3593
01:25:55,031 --> 01:25:56,470
I cannot learn armbar sweep,

3594
01:25:56,471 --> 01:25:57,304
triangle choke,

3595
01:25:57,310 --> 01:25:57,701
double leg,

3596
01:25:57,701 --> 01:26:00,550
take down under hook might
have tax my whole system.

3597
01:26:00,820 --> 01:26:01,990
My system is in recovery.

3598
01:26:02,260 --> 01:26:03,410
When your systems in recovery,

3599
01:26:03,411 --> 01:26:04,244
what can you do

3600
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:06,080
but rest in the sun.

3601
01:26:06,530 --> 01:26:06,771
Okay.

3602
01:26:06,771 --> 01:26:07,370
Half a Mendez.

3603
01:26:07,370 --> 01:26:08,420
Do you think half a Mendez,

3604
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:08,781
one of the,

3605
01:26:08,781 --> 01:26:09,980
arguably the greatest pound for pound,

3606
01:26:10,010 --> 01:26:11,720
one of the greatest profit pounds
Jiu Jitsu guys in the world.

3607
01:26:11,721 --> 01:26:12,650
Do you think he's got a great,

3608
01:26:12,910 --> 01:26:13,743
uh,

3609
01:26:13,820 --> 01:26:15,800
a crossfit workout that
he's really mastered?

3610
01:26:15,801 --> 01:26:16,251
He's really good.

3611
01:26:16,251 --> 01:26:17,420
I do think it has a great back squat.

3612
01:26:17,421 --> 01:26:18,500
Do you think he's a great dead lifter?

3613
01:26:18,950 --> 01:26:19,700
It doesn't look like it.

3614
01:26:19,700 --> 01:26:19,881
No,

3615
01:26:19,881 --> 01:26:20,714
he doesn't believe me.

3616
01:26:20,930 --> 01:26:21,700
You think we think,

3617
01:26:21,700 --> 01:26:22,240
uh,

3618
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:22,880
uh,

3619
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:23,571
Gordon Ryan,

3620
01:26:23,571 --> 01:26:24,351
he's a great,

3621
01:26:24,351 --> 01:26:24,700
uh,

3622
01:26:24,700 --> 01:26:25,360
Olympic lifter.

3623
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:25,640
No,

3624
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:25,821
they,

3625
01:26:25,821 --> 01:26:26,120
they,

3626
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:26,430
they're,

3627
01:26:26,430 --> 01:26:28,280
they're always going to
be at an amateur level.

3628
01:26:28,340 --> 01:26:29,780
And that in the fitness world,

3629
01:26:29,781 --> 01:26:30,021
why?

3630
01:26:30,021 --> 01:26:31,730
Because if they were experts,

3631
01:26:31,731 --> 01:26:33,260
they would have taken so much from,

3632
01:26:33,261 --> 01:26:34,094
there's Jujitsu,

3633
01:26:34,420 --> 01:26:34,631
like,

3634
01:26:34,631 --> 01:26:35,180
look at Georgia.

3635
01:26:35,180 --> 01:26:35,930
Does gymnastics.

3636
01:26:35,930 --> 01:26:36,141
Okay.

3637
01:26:36,141 --> 01:26:36,201
I,

3638
01:26:36,201 --> 01:26:38,930
and I'm the one who quite twisted his
arm a little to put them in gymnastics.

3639
01:26:39,140 --> 01:26:39,940
Why?

3640
01:26:39,940 --> 01:26:40,190
Uh,

3641
01:26:40,190 --> 01:26:40,881
because I thought it would,

3642
01:26:40,881 --> 01:26:42,470
it would give them a
tremendous benefit because,

3643
01:26:42,471 --> 01:26:42,770
uh,

3644
01:26:42,770 --> 01:26:43,051
of,

3645
01:26:43,051 --> 01:26:43,340
uh,

3646
01:26:43,340 --> 01:26:44,180
the amount of,

3647
01:26:44,181 --> 01:26:44,600
first of all,

3648
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:45,620
they use a lot of body weight,

3649
01:26:45,770 --> 01:26:48,350
so it doesn't cost us
anything neurologically.

3650
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:52,100
Bodyweight exercises are
very easy to recover from.

3651
01:26:53,510 --> 01:26:57,050
Bodyweight exercises are very
easy on the nervous system.

3652
01:26:58,130 --> 01:27:01,360
They use leverage instead of
weights plus the stabilizers.

3653
01:27:01,361 --> 01:27:02,270
Strength is unbelievable.

3654
01:27:03,020 --> 01:27:04,910
So of course I want a coordination.

3655
01:27:04,911 --> 01:27:06,130
I felt George was a little bit stiff,

3656
01:27:06,150 --> 01:27:09,800
mechanical and the tumbling
makes you more fluid.

3657
01:27:10,370 --> 01:27:11,070
I think I,

3658
01:27:11,070 --> 01:27:12,710
I thought it would create
more efficiency this way.

3659
01:27:14,330 --> 01:27:15,350
So we get them there and there's,

3660
01:27:15,351 --> 01:27:16,250
there's difficulties.

3661
01:27:16,251 --> 01:27:16,401
Okay.

3662
01:27:16,401 --> 01:27:17,300
From eight to F,

3663
01:27:18,410 --> 01:27:21,110
we're still at a and B
and he'll always be at a,

3664
01:27:21,111 --> 01:27:21,321
and B,

3665
01:27:21,321 --> 01:27:21,981
maybe he'll touch,

3666
01:27:21,981 --> 01:27:22,850
see it in his career,

3667
01:27:23,420 --> 01:27:24,320
but he'll never get to f.

3668
01:27:24,321 --> 01:27:27,620
You'd have to start really young
and you'd have to do it full time.

3669
01:27:28,070 --> 01:27:28,371
You know,

3670
01:27:28,371 --> 01:27:30,740
imagine somebody trying
to get good at Jujitsu,

3671
01:27:30,741 --> 01:27:31,371
doing it part time.

3672
01:27:31,371 --> 01:27:32,150
He'll never get good.

3673
01:27:32,150 --> 01:27:32,421
He'll do,

3674
01:27:32,421 --> 01:27:32,871
he'll be so,

3675
01:27:32,871 --> 01:27:34,190
so he'll reach such a level.

3676
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:38,420
Crossfit is to fatigue
seeking for an MMA fighter.

3677
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:40,970
Now if crossfitters followed,

3678
01:27:41,410 --> 01:27:41,661
uh,

3679
01:27:41,661 --> 01:27:41,991
if the,

3680
01:27:41,991 --> 01:27:43,790
if they just follow that 70% rule,

3681
01:27:44,310 --> 01:27:48,290
they can periodically went to their max
periodically as opposed to every single

3682
01:27:48,291 --> 01:27:48,800
workout.

3683
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:49,730
Go total the out.

3684
01:27:50,330 --> 01:27:52,640
I bet you their top top guys
don't go all out every day.

3685
01:27:53,690 --> 01:27:54,321
I bet you a few.

3686
01:27:54,321 --> 01:27:55,430
If you watch with their top guys,

3687
01:27:55,431 --> 01:27:59,270
do they taper off the work that they
make the workout between 70 and 85% of

3688
01:27:59,271 --> 01:28:03,470
their true Max and they work volume
and then closer to competition,

3689
01:28:03,471 --> 01:28:04,580
they go hire an intensity.

3690
01:28:04,581 --> 01:28:06,350
I guarantee you that's what
the best crossfitters do.

3691
01:28:06,650 --> 01:28:10,010
There's no way that the guy who goes
balls out every day is going to add up as

3692
01:28:10,011 --> 01:28:13,730
much workout and as much training time
as the guy who was going 70 to 85% of his

3693
01:28:13,731 --> 01:28:14,090
Max.

3694
01:28:14,090 --> 01:28:14,923
There's just no way.

3695
01:28:15,620 --> 01:28:16,970
But when they do those classes,

3696
01:28:16,971 --> 01:28:18,350
like say they do a crossfit class,

3697
01:28:18,351 --> 01:28:19,700
and I'm speaking out of ignorance,

3698
01:28:19,701 --> 01:28:20,121
honestly,

3699
01:28:20,121 --> 01:28:21,530
because I only watch them on video.

3700
01:28:21,531 --> 01:28:23,150
I've never done it across the class,

3701
01:28:23,151 --> 01:28:24,860
but it seems to me they're
competing against each other.

3702
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:24,960
Yeah,

3703
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:27,560
they're going all out trying
to set a PR every class.

3704
01:28:27,590 --> 01:28:28,040
Yeah,

3705
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:28,850
that's ridiculous.

3706
01:28:28,850 --> 01:28:29,481
All the respect.

3707
01:28:29,481 --> 01:28:30,280
I mean it's just,

3708
01:28:30,280 --> 01:28:31,220
it doesn't make any sense,

3709
01:28:31,730 --> 01:28:33,170
but why is it so popular?

3710
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:35,540
Because people think
that's right because why?

3711
01:28:35,541 --> 01:28:37,970
Because when you watch
a prime time or a fight,

3712
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:38,840
the guys at the peak,

3713
01:28:38,841 --> 01:28:39,630
he's going at the,

3714
01:28:39,630 --> 01:28:41,050
he's at a point in his career in his foot,

3715
01:28:41,090 --> 01:28:44,300
in his training camp where he's
at the high end of intensity,

3716
01:28:44,390 --> 01:28:47,090
so people are always watching
the last part of your camp,

3717
01:28:48,260 --> 01:28:50,720
the part where you're peaking and then
you're going to go taper off or 10 15

3718
01:28:50,721 --> 01:28:51,554
days.

3719
01:28:51,980 --> 01:28:54,530
They don't see that part and they don't
see the month before where you ramped up

3720
01:28:54,531 --> 01:28:55,364
to that level.

3721
01:28:55,490 --> 01:28:56,930
They just see the last two,

3722
01:28:56,931 --> 01:29:00,260
three weeks where it's the
last few sparrings and we're
mimicking fight speed to

3723
01:29:00,261 --> 01:29:01,530
the maximum as we can.

3724
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:03,330
We're fruiting with danger here.

3725
01:29:03,570 --> 01:29:04,710
We're only doing it a little bit,

3726
01:29:05,130 --> 01:29:06,450
but that's the part everybody's watching,

3727
01:29:06,451 --> 01:29:06,870
so they think,

3728
01:29:06,870 --> 01:29:07,470
oh,

3729
01:29:07,470 --> 01:29:08,850
if you want to become a really good,

3730
01:29:09,180 --> 01:29:10,680
you have to flirt with danger every day.

3731
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:11,910
If that's what their workouts are.

3732
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:13,620
If you see George train
throughout the year,

3733
01:29:13,621 --> 01:29:13,891
you'd be like,

3734
01:29:13,891 --> 01:29:14,011
hey,

3735
01:29:14,011 --> 01:29:15,090
that wasn't so intense.

3736
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:16,320
That wasn't so intense.

3737
01:29:16,321 --> 01:29:18,090
There's another really mellow practice.

3738
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:19,411
I remember when I was younger,

3739
01:29:19,411 --> 01:29:20,460
I was training at the ground brothers,

3740
01:29:20,461 --> 01:29:21,930
Jim and I would see Otis grant,

3741
01:29:21,931 --> 01:29:22,081
you know,

3742
01:29:22,081 --> 01:29:23,400
he's a world champion boxer.

3743
01:29:23,401 --> 01:29:26,430
He says everybody knew him in Canada
because he's a man and he was training

3744
01:29:26,431 --> 01:29:27,750
really relaxed and I was like,

3745
01:29:27,751 --> 01:29:28,051
dude,

3746
01:29:28,051 --> 01:29:29,130
I'm training harder than him.

3747
01:29:29,850 --> 01:29:30,390
But he's,

3748
01:29:30,390 --> 01:29:31,440
that's his millionth workout.

3749
01:29:31,441 --> 01:29:32,730
There was my 10th you know,

3750
01:29:32,970 --> 01:29:34,110
he's doing in the long run,

3751
01:29:34,111 --> 01:29:35,730
he's added way more years of training.

3752
01:29:35,731 --> 01:29:37,650
So that's when I started to
understand that the champion,

3753
01:29:37,860 --> 01:29:38,693
the best guy,

3754
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:41,040
he's training for the long run.

3755
01:29:41,041 --> 01:29:41,970
It's far more intelligent.

3756
01:29:41,971 --> 01:29:45,570
He's getting far more workouts in than
me that's burned out in the next day.

3757
01:29:45,571 --> 01:29:46,280
I need a rest.

3758
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:46,940
Right?

3759
01:29:46,940 --> 01:29:47,330
Yeah.

3760
01:29:47,330 --> 01:29:47,690
So it's,

3761
01:29:47,690 --> 01:29:49,440
it's consistency over intensity.

3762
01:29:50,430 --> 01:29:53,130
Intensity entails you need to take a
break because there's no way around it.

3763
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:57,840
So if you're a young person listening
to this and you're got a coach that's

3764
01:29:57,841 --> 01:29:59,370
trying to burn you out every day,

3765
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:00,713
the fuck do you do?

3766
01:30:01,810 --> 01:30:02,643
I'm

3767
01:30:05,190 --> 01:30:06,240
going to the gym and go,

3768
01:30:06,241 --> 01:30:06,960
you know what?

3769
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:08,880
I was listening to frost
the hobby the other day.

3770
01:30:08,881 --> 01:30:09,691
And for us saying,

3771
01:30:09,691 --> 01:30:10,524
you're a retard.

3772
01:30:12,780 --> 01:30:13,200
Here's my,

3773
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:13,711
here's my,

3774
01:30:13,711 --> 01:30:14,060
uh,

3775
01:30:14,060 --> 01:30:14,270
you know,

3776
01:30:14,270 --> 01:30:15,103
when I roll with the guys,

3777
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:16,530
I think they feel when I grabbed them,

3778
01:30:16,531 --> 01:30:19,770
I'm grabbing them gently and they
realize it and I'll let them,

3779
01:30:19,771 --> 01:30:20,010
like,

3780
01:30:20,010 --> 01:30:20,940
I like guys pass my guard.

3781
01:30:21,250 --> 01:30:25,530
Like I'll just go ahead and start
second tool and I'll just get,

3782
01:30:25,531 --> 01:30:27,270
they'll get the message that
we're just kinda playing around.

3783
01:30:27,420 --> 01:30:27,990
Right.

3784
01:30:27,990 --> 01:30:29,700
And then later when we
were going more intense,

3785
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:30,390
you know,

3786
01:30:30,390 --> 01:30:31,080
they'll feel it,

3787
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:32,100
they'll feel the intensity.

3788
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:33,810
But I don't always roll heart.

3789
01:30:34,230 --> 01:30:35,550
Like if you see me rolling,

3790
01:30:35,551 --> 01:30:37,580
like I usually will roll with
blue belts and pro ball swipe.

3791
01:30:37,590 --> 01:30:38,430
Does there need to warm up?

3792
01:30:38,490 --> 01:30:39,031
I need three,

3793
01:30:39,031 --> 01:30:39,980
four rounds of warmup,

3794
01:30:40,300 --> 01:30:41,100
right?

3795
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:44,770
I don't want to even have a tight
shoulder or tight hamstring.

3796
01:30:45,540 --> 01:30:47,370
I don't want anything type of course.

3797
01:30:47,430 --> 01:30:49,020
So I warm up with them.

3798
01:30:49,021 --> 01:30:49,441
Really good one.

3799
01:30:49,441 --> 01:30:50,100
I'm really warm.

3800
01:30:50,100 --> 01:30:51,510
Then I go in at a wrestle,

3801
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:52,741
I like to go rest.

3802
01:30:52,741 --> 01:30:53,490
I extend,

3803
01:30:53,490 --> 01:30:53,731
okay,

3804
01:30:53,731 --> 01:30:54,331
who wants to wrestle?

3805
01:30:54,331 --> 01:30:56,790
Know what's cool because I'm
really warm than I can wrestle.

3806
01:30:56,791 --> 01:30:57,630
I could hit the ground well,

3807
01:30:57,650 --> 01:31:01,710
but you're in a position where you can
sort of determine and dictate what kind

3808
01:31:01,711 --> 01:31:02,970
of exercises you do.

3809
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:03,420
Right.

3810
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:04,020
But if you were,

3811
01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:07,950
the question was like if you were a young
person and you're entering into an MMA

3812
01:31:07,951 --> 01:31:10,050
gym and the instructor,

3813
01:31:10,530 --> 01:31:12,210
those to be kind is a meathead,

3814
01:31:12,780 --> 01:31:13,051
right?

3815
01:31:13,051 --> 01:31:14,370
Which there's a lot of them out there.

3816
01:31:14,371 --> 01:31:14,960
There is,

3817
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:15,690
yeah.

3818
01:31:15,690 --> 01:31:16,431
What do you do?

3819
01:31:16,431 --> 01:31:17,264
What do you do?

3820
01:31:17,380 --> 01:31:17,680
A,

3821
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:19,440
you might have to take a
few beatings as white belt,

3822
01:31:20,370 --> 01:31:20,830
you might like,

3823
01:31:20,830 --> 01:31:21,241
I mean,

3824
01:31:21,241 --> 01:31:22,710
I grind my gears when I was younger,

3825
01:31:22,711 --> 01:31:26,790
but as you get older and more skilled
now you can take the VIP lane,

3826
01:31:26,970 --> 01:31:27,271
you know,

3827
01:31:27,271 --> 01:31:27,811
now's the time,

3828
01:31:27,811 --> 01:31:29,640
you've got the skill and
you've got the knowledge,

3829
01:31:29,850 --> 01:31:31,680
but early on you have less miles on you,

3830
01:31:31,681 --> 01:31:31,950
so it's,

3831
01:31:31,950 --> 01:31:32,850
you'll survive more,

3832
01:31:32,851 --> 01:31:33,540
more of a beating.

3833
01:31:33,540 --> 01:31:34,231
You ever see those?

3834
01:31:34,231 --> 01:31:38,490
There's a lot of Jujitsu classes where
they go through an extremely rigorous

3835
01:31:38,491 --> 01:31:41,610
conditioning routine before
they ever do any training.

3836
01:31:42,270 --> 01:31:45,150
And I've always disagreed
with that and I agree totally.

3837
01:31:45,151 --> 01:31:45,600
Right.

3838
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:45,901
Yeah.

3839
01:31:45,901 --> 01:31:48,090
I feel like show me one world
champion that did it that way.

3840
01:31:48,330 --> 01:31:48,930
Wow.

3841
01:31:48,930 --> 01:31:49,380
I Dunno.

3842
01:31:49,380 --> 01:31:50,010
Maybe.

3843
01:31:50,010 --> 01:31:51,780
Maybe it's possible that they did.

3844
01:31:51,990 --> 01:31:52,530
Who?

3845
01:31:52,530 --> 01:31:53,100
I don't know.

3846
01:31:53,100 --> 01:31:54,270
I don't know who did what.

3847
01:31:54,271 --> 01:31:59,271
I've trained with a lot of the greatest
Jujitsu guys in the world and they're

3848
01:32:00,551 --> 01:32:02,440
all warm up a technique.

3849
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:03,250
Yeah,

3850
01:32:03,250 --> 01:32:03,990
all of them.

3851
01:32:03,990 --> 01:32:06,420
Do you think Ryan Hall gets up and
does the burpees before practice?

3852
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:07,011
You think he goes in,

3853
01:32:07,011 --> 01:32:09,010
he runs five miles and he does weights.

3854
01:32:09,250 --> 01:32:12,460
I know that like a lot
of the old school guys,

3855
01:32:12,730 --> 01:32:13,181
they were,

3856
01:32:13,181 --> 01:32:14,480
they were into that like a,

3857
01:32:14,481 --> 01:32:16,750
isn't half Gracie famous for his,

3858
01:32:16,751 --> 01:32:16,870
uh,

3859
01:32:16,870 --> 01:32:17,920
those conditioning drills?

3860
01:32:17,921 --> 01:32:18,754
They do.

3861
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:19,121
I don't know,

3862
01:32:19,121 --> 01:32:20,020
but he never went to like,

3863
01:32:20,021 --> 01:32:20,800
uh,

3864
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:21,130
you know,

3865
01:32:21,130 --> 01:32:21,511
I mean he,

3866
01:32:21,511 --> 01:32:23,830
he was in a time and place where
very few people knew Jujitsu.

3867
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:26,740
Right now we're in where the secret's out.

3868
01:32:26,890 --> 01:32:27,641
Who are the top guys?

3869
01:32:27,641 --> 01:32:28,474
What are they doing?

3870
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:29,381
Yeah.

3871
01:32:29,381 --> 01:32:33,070
I feel like there's also a thing where
people want to be really tired from

3872
01:32:33,071 --> 01:32:33,700
workouts.

3873
01:32:33,700 --> 01:32:37,210
They feel like they're getting a great
workout in if you beat them down.

3874
01:32:38,260 --> 01:32:38,860
Yeah.

3875
01:32:38,860 --> 01:32:39,693
I agree with that.

3876
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:40,091
There's,

3877
01:32:40,091 --> 01:32:40,720
there's,

3878
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:41,411
there's a debt,

3879
01:32:41,411 --> 01:32:42,250
a disconnect.

3880
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:42,820
It was like,

3881
01:32:42,820 --> 01:32:43,600
I want to feel paid,

3882
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:44,200
punish me.

3883
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:44,441
Yeah.

3884
01:32:44,441 --> 01:32:46,960
You're your retarding growth though.

3885
01:32:47,260 --> 01:32:50,750
You know like people don't like that
word retard anymore but because you know

3886
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:53,090
they think you're talking about
someone with a disease but the,

3887
01:32:53,091 --> 01:32:57,460
the real term of being
of retarding you are,

3888
01:32:57,510 --> 01:33:02,510
you're slowing down growth and that's
really what retarded action is.

3889
01:33:04,241 --> 01:33:04,651
Like you're,

3890
01:33:04,651 --> 01:33:04,921
you,

3891
01:33:04,921 --> 01:33:09,921
you have an issue in that the way you're
approaching things is uniquely damaging

3892
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:14,200
to your ultimate goal of progress.

3893
01:33:14,620 --> 01:33:15,453
And I agree.

3894
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:17,620
It's so common.

3895
01:33:18,210 --> 01:33:19,960
If someone right now is listening,

3896
01:33:21,190 --> 01:33:21,940
he is mine.

3897
01:33:21,940 --> 01:33:24,880
It's blog is my better going to class and
they know that they're going to happen

3898
01:33:24,881 --> 01:33:29,320
to all these crazy burpees and
all this crazy shit before class.

3899
01:33:29,321 --> 01:33:30,610
It's so fucking comment.

3900
01:33:30,910 --> 01:33:31,743
ICARUS,

3901
01:33:31,990 --> 01:33:33,130
you flight to close to the sun.

3902
01:33:33,131 --> 01:33:33,860
What happens to you?

3903
01:33:33,860 --> 01:33:35,890
You get burned by this.

3904
01:33:35,910 --> 01:33:38,290
His stay in the middle
there in the middle.

3905
01:33:38,291 --> 01:33:41,500
If you get to do those conditioning
exercises kind of half asam halfass and a

3906
01:33:41,501 --> 01:33:41,770
bit,

3907
01:33:41,770 --> 01:33:42,150
yeah,

3908
01:33:42,150 --> 01:33:42,930
you permission.

3909
01:33:42,930 --> 01:33:43,763
That's why I like,

3910
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:45,460
I like to make conditioning after.

3911
01:33:46,210 --> 01:33:46,481
Yeah.

3912
01:33:46,481 --> 01:33:49,060
Because my body is warm and I don't need,

3913
01:33:49,090 --> 01:33:49,751
cause the thing is look,

3914
01:33:49,751 --> 01:33:51,100
when you do conditioning,

3915
01:33:51,101 --> 01:33:52,690
before you weaken your stabilizers,

3916
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:53,553
the prime mover,

3917
01:33:53,590 --> 01:33:54,190
the Ma,

3918
01:33:54,190 --> 01:33:57,400
the muscles in your body that are prime
movers have more interest than your

3919
01:33:57,401 --> 01:33:58,234
stabilizers.

3920
01:33:58,240 --> 01:33:59,740
So few weekend the stabilizers,

3921
01:34:00,520 --> 01:34:02,410
your joint is less stable
while you're rolling.

3922
01:34:02,530 --> 01:34:03,363
Yes.

3923
01:34:03,850 --> 01:34:06,640
The element of fatigue can
put your joints in danger.

3924
01:34:06,670 --> 01:34:09,190
That's why I only do cause when you're,

3925
01:34:09,191 --> 01:34:09,491
when you're,

3926
01:34:09,491 --> 01:34:10,420
when you're doing exercises,

3927
01:34:10,421 --> 01:34:10,991
you're in control.

3928
01:34:10,991 --> 01:34:13,270
You're not in a live role with
somebody trying to tug on your arm.

3929
01:34:13,410 --> 01:34:13,691
Right.

3930
01:34:13,691 --> 01:34:16,630
So I need maximum strength when somebody
is trying to tug on my arm in case I'm

3931
01:34:16,631 --> 01:34:17,464
in a bad position,

3932
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:18,701
I need to make sure that I have,

3933
01:34:18,701 --> 01:34:20,620
my strength levels are
there to protect my joints.

3934
01:34:21,420 --> 01:34:22,010
Joint protect.

3935
01:34:22,010 --> 01:34:23,200
Joint protection is huge.

3936
01:34:23,201 --> 01:34:24,670
You need to make sure
your joints are healthy.

3937
01:34:24,671 --> 01:34:25,420
It's huge.

3938
01:34:25,420 --> 01:34:26,000
What what,

3939
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,660
what kind of exercises do you do to
make sure your joints are protected?

3940
01:34:28,690 --> 01:34:30,670
Well I do the supple leopard,

3941
01:34:30,671 --> 01:34:35,350
I do a lot of mobility work and
I do low impact plyometrics,

3942
01:34:35,830 --> 01:34:36,663
low impact.

3943
01:34:36,700 --> 01:34:36,851
So,

3944
01:34:36,851 --> 01:34:37,241
for instance,

3945
01:34:37,241 --> 01:34:38,051
that's why I like the Med ball.

3946
01:34:38,051 --> 01:34:39,280
Throwing the Med ball against the wall.

3947
01:34:39,910 --> 01:34:40,840
I like to do steps.

3948
01:34:40,841 --> 01:34:41,890
You know like you have a block,

3949
01:34:42,070 --> 01:34:43,600
like a 12 inch block and like to jump,

3950
01:34:43,601 --> 01:34:46,270
like do steps over a back and forth.

3951
01:34:46,271 --> 01:34:47,170
So you kind of jumped up in the air,

3952
01:34:47,171 --> 01:34:49,390
but she never leave the ground
because the block is also high.

3953
01:34:49,870 --> 01:34:51,460
So you never get the negative contraction.

3954
01:34:51,461 --> 01:34:52,870
You never get the impact
of hitting the ground.

3955
01:34:53,260 --> 01:34:54,190
Alec sprinting.

3956
01:34:54,191 --> 01:34:54,631
I like club.

3957
01:34:54,631 --> 01:34:55,271
Explain that.

3958
01:34:55,271 --> 01:34:56,830
How do you not getting the negative?

3959
01:34:57,290 --> 01:34:58,970
So let's say for instance there's,

3960
01:34:58,971 --> 01:35:01,430
this is a block and this
is my feet right here,

3961
01:35:01,570 --> 01:35:01,760
right?

3962
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:02,300
So I'm like this,

3963
01:35:02,300 --> 01:35:03,830
I'll jump like I saw,

3964
01:35:03,831 --> 01:35:04,664
I'll jump.

3965
01:35:06,230 --> 01:35:06,591
Okay,

3966
01:35:06,591 --> 01:35:07,850
so you touched the block.

3967
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:09,050
I've touching the block so I'm never,

3968
01:35:09,051 --> 01:35:09,290
when I,

3969
01:35:09,290 --> 01:35:10,400
when I jumped off the ground,

3970
01:35:10,670 --> 01:35:13,370
I'm landing on the block so I'm always,

3971
01:35:13,430 --> 01:35:14,151
I'm stepping down,

3972
01:35:14,151 --> 01:35:14,870
jumping up,

3973
01:35:14,870 --> 01:35:15,531
stepping down,

3974
01:35:15,531 --> 01:35:16,100
jumping up.

3975
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:16,700
I say,

3976
01:35:16,700 --> 01:35:21,550
so I'm always exploding up but landing
on a block softly because it's,

3977
01:35:21,551 --> 01:35:22,790
it's when you jump up,

3978
01:35:22,791 --> 01:35:24,290
it's the landing that kills your joints.

3979
01:35:24,770 --> 01:35:26,480
If I put up a a 50 inch box,

3980
01:35:26,481 --> 01:35:26,641
Emma,

3981
01:35:26,641 --> 01:35:29,120
you jump up the landings in be very soft.

3982
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:33,680
If I tell you jump over a hurdle now
you're in midair and you're crushing down

3983
01:35:33,681 --> 01:35:34,940
towards the ground and you land,

3984
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:36,590
you got to absorb that shock.

3985
01:35:37,460 --> 01:35:39,020
But that's why I like like hill sprints.

3986
01:35:39,021 --> 01:35:41,360
Hill sprints are great because your
foot never leaves the ground even though

3987
01:35:41,361 --> 01:35:44,120
you're exploding upwards that
the ground is coming up with you.

3988
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:45,980
So it's a very soft landing.

3989
01:35:46,220 --> 01:35:47,450
The soft landing is key.

3990
01:35:48,350 --> 01:35:49,170
Yeah,

3991
01:35:49,170 --> 01:35:49,531
no,

3992
01:35:49,531 --> 01:35:50,600
that makes a lot of sense.

3993
01:35:50,990 --> 01:35:52,070
That makes a lot of sense.

3994
01:35:52,460 --> 01:35:54,530
But what about hitting bag then?

3995
01:35:54,620 --> 01:35:55,191
It's the best.

3996
01:35:55,191 --> 01:35:55,881
Cardio is the best.

3997
01:35:55,881 --> 01:35:57,290
I do a lot of Dutch Joe for cardio.

3998
01:35:57,890 --> 01:35:58,910
Dutch drills with Israel.

3999
01:35:59,150 --> 01:35:59,501
Left Hook,

4000
01:35:59,501 --> 01:35:59,701
cry,

4001
01:35:59,701 --> 01:35:59,961
kick,

4002
01:35:59,961 --> 01:36:00,291
right hand,

4003
01:36:00,291 --> 01:36:00,890
left kick,

4004
01:36:00,890 --> 01:36:01,521
three minutes,

4005
01:36:01,521 --> 01:36:02,261
just bad bup,

4006
01:36:02,261 --> 01:36:02,530
bup,

4007
01:36:02,530 --> 01:36:02,750
bup,

4008
01:36:02,750 --> 01:36:03,583
bup home.

4009
01:36:03,980 --> 01:36:06,380
Somebody they do three punch combo
to punch Combo and it finished with a

4010
01:36:06,381 --> 01:36:09,820
kickboard double kick and I just
spiked my heart rate that way.

4011
01:36:09,820 --> 01:36:10,940
I'm developing my skill,

4012
01:36:10,941 --> 01:36:11,780
developing my cardio.

4013
01:36:11,781 --> 01:36:14,580
I get very lean when I do that and uh,

4014
01:36:14,610 --> 01:36:15,231
I feel great.

4015
01:36:15,231 --> 01:36:18,170
I feel my energy levels are up and say
it's better than doing bike or running

4016
01:36:18,171 --> 01:36:20,930
personally cause I'm developing my skill
and I'm also spiking my heart rate.

4017
01:36:21,290 --> 01:36:23,930
A dage drill can be very
intense on the heart rate.

4018
01:36:24,050 --> 01:36:25,760
It's low impact and it's a plow metrics.

4019
01:36:25,761 --> 01:36:26,594
Everything I need.

4020
01:36:27,410 --> 01:36:27,801
Yeah.

4021
01:36:27,801 --> 01:36:28,191
Do you,

4022
01:36:28,191 --> 01:36:28,551
what?

4023
01:36:28,551 --> 01:36:30,380
What wait heavy bag do you use?

4024
01:36:30,620 --> 01:36:31,610
I use the fair text.

4025
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:32,780
The giant pole bag,

4026
01:36:32,781 --> 01:36:34,880
they call it like a big,

4027
01:36:34,881 --> 01:36:36,260
big giant bag of touches the ground.

4028
01:36:36,261 --> 01:36:37,310
So when I kick it it doesn't move.

4029
01:36:37,311 --> 01:36:38,390
Father's heavy as fuck.

4030
01:36:38,690 --> 01:36:39,980
It's like a 300 pound bag,

4031
01:36:39,981 --> 01:36:40,460
right?

4032
01:36:40,460 --> 01:36:40,910
Yeah.

4033
01:36:40,910 --> 01:36:41,743
Why do you like that one?

4034
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:42,800
Because when it kick it,

4035
01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:47,150
the bag doesn't swing so I don't have
to reset so I can keep that pace really

4036
01:36:47,151 --> 01:36:47,510
high.

4037
01:36:47,510 --> 01:36:48,071
So I'm going pop,

4038
01:36:48,071 --> 01:36:48,260
pop,

4039
01:36:48,260 --> 01:36:48,490
pop,

4040
01:36:48,490 --> 01:36:48,701
pop,

4041
01:36:48,701 --> 01:36:48,860
pop,

4042
01:36:48,860 --> 01:36:49,120
pop,

4043
01:36:49,120 --> 01:36:49,331
pop,

4044
01:36:49,331 --> 01:36:49,491
pop,

4045
01:36:49,491 --> 01:36:49,730
pop,

4046
01:36:49,730 --> 01:36:49,971
pop.

4047
01:36:49,971 --> 01:36:52,560
I know you're hitting it full
blast or you just saw them.

4048
01:36:52,700 --> 01:36:53,391
As I get warmed up,

4049
01:36:53,391 --> 01:36:56,960
I hit harder and harder til I'm full
blast so I might start really relaxed,

4050
01:36:56,961 --> 01:36:57,860
kicking low to the leg.

4051
01:36:57,861 --> 01:37:00,560
Then as the work gets warmer and
warmer and hotter and hotter,

4052
01:37:00,561 --> 01:37:01,760
I'm sweating my start kicking to the head.

4053
01:37:02,360 --> 01:37:03,360
Hmm.

4054
01:37:03,640 --> 01:37:05,030
Everything is gradual warmup,

4055
01:37:05,570 --> 01:37:05,781
you know?

4056
01:37:05,781 --> 01:37:06,501
And when I've had enough,

4057
01:37:06,501 --> 01:37:09,740
I stopped like I'm not gonna make myself
sick because I'm working out tomorrow

4058
01:37:09,741 --> 01:37:11,840
again right now.

4059
01:37:11,841 --> 01:37:13,220
What about stretching?

4060
01:37:13,790 --> 01:37:14,331
Stretching,

4061
01:37:14,331 --> 01:37:14,721
I like,

4062
01:37:14,721 --> 01:37:15,830
but I prefer mobility.

4063
01:37:15,860 --> 01:37:17,960
So mobility is the element
of stretching your muscle,

4064
01:37:17,961 --> 01:37:19,040
but also creating motion.

4065
01:37:19,490 --> 01:37:22,730
The joint has to be in a type
of rotation in the route.

4066
01:37:23,270 --> 01:37:23,631
Why?

4067
01:37:23,631 --> 01:37:26,300
Because you're creating Sylvan
synovial fluid to the joint.

4068
01:37:26,330 --> 01:37:29,150
The joint is really more important to
me than the muscle because the muscle

4069
01:37:29,151 --> 01:37:30,230
rejuvenates itself.

4070
01:37:30,710 --> 01:37:31,543
The joint doesn't,

4071
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:33,170
it does let us lesser degree,

4072
01:37:33,171 --> 01:37:34,850
so I got to always be
oiling up the joints.

4073
01:37:34,851 --> 01:37:35,780
This is very important to me.

4074
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:37,393
Very important.

4075
01:37:37,550 --> 01:37:39,290
Now when you say like mobility,

4076
01:37:39,291 --> 01:37:42,140
like what do you do like for your
hamstrings and things like that?

4077
01:37:42,141 --> 01:37:45,260
If you're trying to stretch
them out and also do mobility.

4078
01:37:45,530 --> 01:37:46,880
So let's say I stretch out my leg,

4079
01:37:46,910 --> 01:37:50,060
I'll be just kind of bending
at the hit in and out.

4080
01:37:50,630 --> 01:37:52,040
I won't just leave it out there static.

4081
01:37:52,730 --> 01:37:54,110
There has to be a type of motion.

4082
01:37:54,380 --> 01:37:56,730
I said it's very important because when
I'm wrestling or I'm doing Jiu Jitsu,

4083
01:37:56,731 --> 01:37:58,080
my legs out there and I'm creating motion,

4084
01:37:58,081 --> 01:37:58,561
I have to move.

4085
01:37:58,561 --> 01:37:59,700
I'm not just putting it out there.

4086
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:00,510
Right.

4087
01:38:00,510 --> 01:38:03,930
There's always a type of movement because
when I stretch my leg out to stop you

4088
01:38:03,931 --> 01:38:04,561
from passing the guard,

4089
01:38:04,561 --> 01:38:06,070
I'm going to be moving
my body at the same time.

4090
01:38:06,070 --> 01:38:06,661
So that's mobility.

4091
01:38:06,661 --> 01:38:07,021
It's different.

4092
01:38:07,021 --> 01:38:07,520
Some stretching,

4093
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:08,190
mobility.

4094
01:38:08,190 --> 01:38:09,750
There is a stretch element and mobility,

4095
01:38:10,110 --> 01:38:10,711
but it's stretching.

4096
01:38:10,711 --> 01:38:11,640
There's no mobility element.

4097
01:38:12,450 --> 01:38:13,350
Now what about yoga?

4098
01:38:14,340 --> 01:38:18,330
I think yoga is good for
relaxation and the range of motion.

4099
01:38:18,331 --> 01:38:19,020
I think it's very good.

4100
01:38:19,020 --> 01:38:21,540
I just don't personally have the time
and energy for it because I'm always in

4101
01:38:21,541 --> 01:38:21,901
the gym.

4102
01:38:21,901 --> 01:38:23,220
So for me to find time for yoga,

4103
01:38:23,221 --> 01:38:24,180
it's just a little bit difficult,

4104
01:38:24,181 --> 01:38:28,080
but I think it does allow for a great
range of motion and relaxation and

4105
01:38:28,081 --> 01:38:28,621
centering.

4106
01:38:28,621 --> 01:38:29,850
If you have the time in your schedule.

4107
01:38:29,851 --> 01:38:30,684
It's good.

4108
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:33,060
I just personally with
three kids and then my,

4109
01:38:33,210 --> 01:38:34,021
everything that I do,

4110
01:38:34,021 --> 01:38:34,620
I just,

4111
01:38:34,620 --> 01:38:35,970
I'm in the gym already too much.

4112
01:38:36,090 --> 01:38:36,450
Right,

4113
01:38:36,450 --> 01:38:36,780
right,

4114
01:38:36,780 --> 01:38:37,613
right.

4115
01:38:37,650 --> 01:38:37,951
Yeah.

4116
01:38:37,951 --> 01:38:39,930
I just wonder like for fighters,

4117
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:43,800
I mean I'm hearing more and more fighters
incorporate yoga into the training

4118
01:38:43,801 --> 01:38:46,410
sessions to just try to
create more balance and,

4119
01:38:46,710 --> 01:38:48,150
and also stability,

4120
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:51,990
joint stability in particular because
you're holding these static positions for

4121
01:38:51,991 --> 01:38:54,380
long periods of time valance and,

4122
01:38:54,790 --> 01:38:55,440
and,

4123
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:57,390
and it's a brilliant
art your core as well.

4124
01:38:57,420 --> 01:38:57,601
Yeah,

4125
01:38:57,601 --> 01:38:58,434
it's a brilliant art.

4126
01:38:58,830 --> 01:39:00,570
If you can have the time
and energy to do it,

4127
01:39:00,571 --> 01:39:01,404
it's great.

4128
01:39:02,010 --> 01:39:03,030
Now what about nutrition?

4129
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:04,530
Nutrition is huge.

4130
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:05,430
What do you,

4131
01:39:05,430 --> 01:39:06,263
how do you eat?

4132
01:39:06,820 --> 01:39:07,200
Uh,

4133
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:10,680
right now I just finished Ramadan so I've
been eating a lot of processed foods.

4134
01:39:10,681 --> 01:39:11,451
I've had like Robin,

4135
01:39:11,451 --> 01:39:12,240
Don's like the,

4136
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:14,700
with the time of the year where I
gained a lot of weight because normally

4137
01:39:14,701 --> 01:39:16,680
throughout the year I ate
very little processed foods.

4138
01:39:16,980 --> 01:39:17,940
I eat natural foods.

4139
01:39:18,390 --> 01:39:19,141
But during Ramadan,

4140
01:39:19,141 --> 01:39:20,730
because I was such a small window to eat,

4141
01:39:20,910 --> 01:39:23,370
to fit my calories in and
I'm very busy all year round,

4142
01:39:23,410 --> 01:39:23,911
I'm always,

4143
01:39:23,911 --> 01:39:26,460
I'm always have projects so
we're not fights traveling.

4144
01:39:26,850 --> 01:39:28,860
I eat processed foods when
I eat processed foods out.

4145
01:39:28,861 --> 01:39:29,694
Why process?

4146
01:39:29,700 --> 01:39:30,900
Because there's more calories in them.

4147
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:31,860
You know,

4148
01:39:31,860 --> 01:39:32,250
if I got,

4149
01:39:32,250 --> 01:39:33,330
if I got to get my,

4150
01:39:33,510 --> 01:39:35,640
if I'm going to go the
whole day after no water,

4151
01:39:35,641 --> 01:39:36,474
no food,

4152
01:39:37,110 --> 01:39:38,760
I need to have eaten a certain amount of,

4153
01:39:38,820 --> 01:39:39,091
of,

4154
01:39:39,091 --> 01:39:39,420
of,

4155
01:39:39,420 --> 01:39:40,860
of calories in the night.

4156
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:42,460
So if I eat whole,

4157
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:44,190
if I eat a salad and then some fruits,

4158
01:39:44,390 --> 01:39:44,730
um,

4159
01:39:44,730 --> 01:39:45,563
I'm going to be,

4160
01:39:45,690 --> 01:39:47,160
I'm going to be at zero byte,

4161
01:39:47,161 --> 01:39:49,770
afternoon ride in a hot
gym with a bunch of guys.

4162
01:39:49,771 --> 01:39:53,000
We need to drill and work and I'm sweating
in the gym just standing there and

4163
01:39:53,010 --> 01:39:53,940
haven't even started yet.

4164
01:39:53,960 --> 01:39:54,391
I'm sweating.

4165
01:39:54,391 --> 01:39:55,081
I got to hold pads.

4166
01:39:55,081 --> 01:39:56,010
I've got to wrestle this guy.

4167
01:39:56,340 --> 01:39:58,170
This guy needs these positions like I'm,

4168
01:39:58,280 --> 01:40:00,240
I'm working and at zero.

4169
01:40:00,241 --> 01:40:01,040
So I need that,

4170
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:01,830
that,

4171
01:40:01,830 --> 01:40:03,990
that density of foods that I get from,

4172
01:40:03,991 --> 01:40:04,260
uh,

4173
01:40:04,260 --> 01:40:04,980
um,

4174
01:40:04,980 --> 01:40:05,520
uh,

4175
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:06,091
processed foods.

4176
01:40:06,091 --> 01:40:10,950
But if I take a serious
loss in energy and,

4177
01:40:10,951 --> 01:40:11,121
and,

4178
01:40:11,121 --> 01:40:11,510
and,

4179
01:40:11,510 --> 01:40:12,240
and I get,

4180
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:13,200
I got to gain weight for sure.

4181
01:40:13,201 --> 01:40:14,034
No doubt about it.

4182
01:40:14,250 --> 01:40:14,700
Wow.

4183
01:40:14,700 --> 01:40:17,010
Salsas foods is the worst for Ramadan,

4184
01:40:17,011 --> 01:40:22,011
for the month in the moment you
wake up until the sun goes down.

4185
01:40:22,170 --> 01:40:23,220
You can't have any food,

4186
01:40:23,250 --> 01:40:23,820
any water.

4187
01:40:23,820 --> 01:40:24,031
No.

4188
01:40:24,031 --> 01:40:26,310
From the Sunrise Sunrise.

4189
01:40:26,660 --> 01:40:28,050
So you wake up before sunrise,

4190
01:40:28,140 --> 01:40:28,650
right?

4191
01:40:28,650 --> 01:40:29,483
You will eat.

4192
01:40:30,150 --> 01:40:31,260
Most people do that by the,

4193
01:40:31,290 --> 01:40:31,900
by the middle,

4194
01:40:31,900 --> 01:40:32,820
by midway of Ramadan.

4195
01:40:32,821 --> 01:40:34,470
I stopped doing that because
I just can't get up anymore.

4196
01:40:34,770 --> 01:40:35,603
I just can't wake up.

4197
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:36,930
My buddy is a bit of a wreck.

4198
01:40:37,590 --> 01:40:39,090
So butts from sunrise

4199
01:40:40,590 --> 01:40:41,423
to sunset,

4200
01:40:41,610 --> 01:40:42,780
you're not consuming anything.

4201
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:45,001
No food,

4202
01:40:45,001 --> 01:40:45,834
no water.

4203
01:40:45,990 --> 01:40:46,691
If you can have water,

4204
01:40:46,691 --> 01:40:47,131
it will be easy.

4205
01:40:47,131 --> 01:40:48,250
Like I don't people who do water fast,

4206
01:40:48,251 --> 01:40:49,084
I've done waterfowl.

4207
01:40:49,120 --> 01:40:49,831
It's quite easy.

4208
01:40:49,831 --> 01:40:50,491
You have the energy,

4209
01:40:50,491 --> 01:40:51,360
but when you cut the water,

4210
01:40:51,361 --> 01:40:51,680
it's,

4211
01:40:51,680 --> 01:40:52,513
it's a,

4212
01:40:52,890 --> 01:40:53,591
it becomes a problem.

4213
01:40:53,591 --> 01:40:56,290
Especially if you're in a hot gym
and you just sweating standing there.

4214
01:40:56,570 --> 01:40:57,000
Yeah,

4215
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:57,160
no,

4216
01:40:57,160 --> 01:40:58,750
it's in the summer run nuns in the summer.

4217
01:40:58,751 --> 01:41:00,520
It's very humid in Canada and it's hot,

4218
01:41:01,120 --> 01:41:01,953
very hot.

4219
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:04,330
So I have to be very careful
and that's why at night,

4220
01:41:04,690 --> 01:41:07,590
even just to resist eating
processed foods is too difficult.

4221
01:41:07,670 --> 01:41:08,503
You gotta eat.

4222
01:41:08,950 --> 01:41:12,640
So do you have a specific calorie
number that you try to hit?

4223
01:41:13,240 --> 01:41:13,721
Uh,

4224
01:41:13,721 --> 01:41:13,961
no.

4225
01:41:13,961 --> 01:41:14,650
Not really.

4226
01:41:14,650 --> 01:41:15,071
Honestly,

4227
01:41:15,071 --> 01:41:15,251
no.

4228
01:41:15,251 --> 01:41:16,360
I just kind of foods you're eating.

4229
01:41:16,361 --> 01:41:17,310
When you say process,

4230
01:41:17,470 --> 01:41:20,440
whatever my mom or wife is going to
make and I'm going to eat like a pastor,

4231
01:41:20,441 --> 01:41:21,520
I'm going to eat like a,

4232
01:41:21,550 --> 01:41:23,170
I'm an eat bread,

4233
01:41:23,171 --> 01:41:23,950
I'm going to eat,

4234
01:41:23,950 --> 01:41:24,670
uh,

4235
01:41:24,670 --> 01:41:24,941
you know,

4236
01:41:24,941 --> 01:41:25,510
whatever,

4237
01:41:25,510 --> 01:41:25,890
whatever.

4238
01:41:25,890 --> 01:41:27,890
I'm Anita Dessert after
I'm have a cheesecake,

4239
01:41:27,940 --> 01:41:28,780
like I'm gonna eat all this stuff.

4240
01:41:28,781 --> 01:41:29,614
I don't eat,

4241
01:41:29,640 --> 01:41:30,640
I'm going to eat all this stuff.

4242
01:41:30,641 --> 01:41:31,400
I'd never eat.

4243
01:41:31,400 --> 01:41:31,810
Wow.

4244
01:41:31,810 --> 01:41:33,070
I'll make myself an Omelet,

4245
01:41:33,071 --> 01:41:33,491
you know,

4246
01:41:33,491 --> 01:41:34,240
I just,

4247
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:34,840
I'll just,

4248
01:41:34,840 --> 01:41:36,280
we'll just crush it at night.

4249
01:41:36,310 --> 01:41:37,150
I crush it at night.

4250
01:41:37,180 --> 01:41:37,811
I crush it at night,

4251
01:41:37,811 --> 01:41:38,770
but I paid the price after,

4252
01:41:38,771 --> 01:41:38,960
you know,

4253
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:39,640
after Ramadan,

4254
01:41:39,640 --> 01:41:40,480
I gotta lose the weight.

4255
01:41:40,481 --> 01:41:41,380
I got to get back in shape.

4256
01:41:41,381 --> 01:41:41,621
I got to,

4257
01:41:41,621 --> 01:41:41,990
you know,

4258
01:41:41,990 --> 01:41:42,260
it's,

4259
01:41:42,260 --> 01:41:42,461
I got,

4260
01:41:42,461 --> 01:41:44,650
it gives a lot of people would think
that if you're not eating all day,

4261
01:41:44,651 --> 01:41:45,580
that you would lose weight.

4262
01:41:45,610 --> 01:41:46,001
Yeah.

4263
01:41:46,001 --> 01:41:47,560
Most people do Ramadan,

4264
01:41:47,561 --> 01:41:48,061
they lose weight.

4265
01:41:48,061 --> 01:41:48,401
Like everybody,

4266
01:41:48,401 --> 01:41:49,211
like I lost weight.

4267
01:41:49,211 --> 01:41:49,590
All his is mine.

4268
01:41:49,590 --> 01:41:49,910
And I'm like,

4269
01:41:49,910 --> 01:41:50,350
Hey guys,

4270
01:41:50,350 --> 01:41:51,070
I gained weight.

4271
01:41:51,070 --> 01:41:51,281
Why?

4272
01:41:51,281 --> 01:41:52,091
Because the thing is,

4273
01:41:52,091 --> 01:41:53,350
I know what I'm doing the next day.

4274
01:41:53,380 --> 01:41:54,213
It's going to be rough.

4275
01:41:54,610 --> 01:41:54,851
You know,

4276
01:41:54,851 --> 01:41:56,770
I'm not just working in an office.

4277
01:41:56,920 --> 01:41:57,071
You know,

4278
01:41:57,071 --> 01:41:57,461
I gotta,

4279
01:41:57,461 --> 01:41:58,091
I gotta move,

4280
01:41:58,091 --> 01:41:58,924
I gotta move my body.

4281
01:41:59,560 --> 01:42:03,850
So I packed the calories in the night
before I hydrate and then I go into the

4282
01:42:03,851 --> 01:42:05,140
gym and I tried to make it like,

4283
01:42:05,410 --> 01:42:05,711
no.

4284
01:42:05,711 --> 01:42:06,280
I'm like,

4285
01:42:06,280 --> 01:42:07,810
I tried to do my routine as usual.

4286
01:42:07,900 --> 01:42:10,090
The hydrating part's got
to be the most difficult.

4287
01:42:10,091 --> 01:42:11,230
That's got to be exhausting.

4288
01:42:11,460 --> 01:42:11,670
Yeah.

4289
01:42:11,670 --> 01:42:12,503
It's stuff.

4290
01:42:12,670 --> 01:42:17,230
Some fighters have actually gone through
training camps while there are no,

4291
01:42:17,710 --> 01:42:18,041
it'd be like,

4292
01:42:18,041 --> 01:42:18,191
well,

4293
01:42:18,191 --> 01:42:19,024
how much?

4294
01:42:19,990 --> 01:42:20,680
Yeah,

4295
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:21,880
very dangerous in my opinion,

4296
01:42:22,420 --> 01:42:24,190
and the risky while he won,

4297
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:24,881
he won.

4298
01:42:24,881 --> 01:42:25,430
God bless him.

4299
01:42:25,430 --> 01:42:26,590
He's that crazy.

4300
01:42:26,620 --> 01:42:27,550
I have one of my fighters now.

4301
01:42:27,551 --> 01:42:28,330
He was doing Ramadan.

4302
01:42:28,330 --> 01:42:29,200
I was telling him off.

4303
01:42:29,230 --> 01:42:29,501
I was like,

4304
01:42:29,501 --> 01:42:29,771
listen,

4305
01:42:29,771 --> 01:42:31,440
you can't book a fight that do Ramadan.

4306
01:42:31,450 --> 01:42:32,283
It's one of the other,

4307
01:42:32,770 --> 01:42:34,540
you guys do your Ramadan after the fight,

4308
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:35,710
but not during the camp.

4309
01:42:35,740 --> 01:42:36,351
This is too risky.

4310
01:42:36,351 --> 01:42:37,184
It's too dangerous.

4311
01:42:39,250 --> 01:42:40,140
He was literally sparked.

4312
01:42:40,160 --> 01:42:40,391
I was like,

4313
01:42:40,391 --> 01:42:40,570
dude,

4314
01:42:40,570 --> 01:42:41,800
why you look so flat that he's like,

4315
01:42:42,130 --> 01:42:42,881
I got to confess to you.

4316
01:42:42,881 --> 01:42:43,061
I'm like,

4317
01:42:43,061 --> 01:42:43,690
what is it?

4318
01:42:43,690 --> 01:42:44,441
I'm doing Ramadan?

4319
01:42:44,441 --> 01:42:44,651
I said,

4320
01:42:44,651 --> 01:42:45,484
dude,

4321
01:42:45,850 --> 01:42:49,120
you either to do Ramadan and cancel
your fight or you book your fight.

4322
01:42:49,150 --> 01:42:51,610
I used to Ramadan after
the two is dangerous.

4323
01:42:51,790 --> 01:42:52,210
It's not,

4324
01:42:52,210 --> 01:42:54,580
the Ramadan is not about
putting yourself in danger.

4325
01:42:54,670 --> 01:42:56,320
Can you do Ramadan anytime you want?

4326
01:42:56,950 --> 01:42:57,330
If it,

4327
01:42:57,330 --> 01:42:58,600
if it interferes with your work,

4328
01:42:59,590 --> 01:43:01,330
you can do it after when it's convenient.

4329
01:43:02,130 --> 01:43:02,531
Okay,

4330
01:43:02,531 --> 01:43:06,600
so you don't have to do it uniformly
w when everyone else is doing no,

4331
01:43:06,670 --> 01:43:08,440
because he has a fight booked.

4332
01:43:08,470 --> 01:43:09,071
It's his career.

4333
01:43:09,071 --> 01:43:10,300
That's how I put food on the table.

4334
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:12,100
So you have an exception here.

4335
01:43:12,370 --> 01:43:12,641
Okay.

4336
01:43:12,641 --> 01:43:14,050
Do you Ramadan after your fight?

4337
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:14,610
Like for instance,

4338
01:43:14,610 --> 01:43:15,670
[inaudible] mirrors that big tech.

4339
01:43:15,680 --> 01:43:17,680
He's doing his Ramadan
after he just fought.

4340
01:43:18,190 --> 01:43:19,120
He's doing it afterwards.

4341
01:43:19,121 --> 01:43:19,331
Why?

4342
01:43:19,331 --> 01:43:20,270
Because during the cattle I was like,

4343
01:43:20,271 --> 01:43:20,470
look,

4344
01:43:20,470 --> 01:43:24,630
you're either doing Ramadan right and
we're canceling the fight or you're going

4345
01:43:24,631 --> 01:43:25,300
to take your,

4346
01:43:25,300 --> 01:43:25,601
you know,

4347
01:43:25,601 --> 01:43:27,010
you need to do your job and you do ramen.

4348
01:43:27,020 --> 01:43:27,371
Then after,

4349
01:43:27,371 --> 01:43:27,791
and he was like,

4350
01:43:27,791 --> 01:43:28,170
okay,

4351
01:43:28,170 --> 01:43:29,350
I understand that's the way it's done.

4352
01:43:29,430 --> 01:43:29,620
You know,

4353
01:43:29,620 --> 01:43:30,820
he looked fantastic.

4354
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:32,110
Did against the good jobs.

4355
01:43:32,140 --> 01:43:32,321
I mean,

4356
01:43:32,321 --> 01:43:35,480
it's just my mama's rather lamas is a,

4357
01:43:35,481 --> 01:43:37,090
a very tough veteran.

4358
01:43:37,960 --> 01:43:39,160
Ricardo has been around.

4359
01:43:39,180 --> 01:43:41,080
He's fought the best of the best.

4360
01:43:41,081 --> 01:43:41,281
He's,

4361
01:43:41,281 --> 01:43:44,560
she's fought for the title
and that was a really,

4362
01:43:44,620 --> 01:43:48,470
really professional performance
by Ricardo came to win.

4363
01:43:48,471 --> 01:43:48,880
And also,

4364
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:51,390
I mean he had that creepy
mustache to beck back ticks.

4365
01:43:51,430 --> 01:43:52,400
Creepy mustache.

4366
01:43:52,980 --> 01:43:53,470
Uh,

4367
01:43:53,470 --> 01:43:54,261
I think he's young.

4368
01:43:54,261 --> 01:43:55,250
He's exploring his looks,

4369
01:43:55,251 --> 01:43:56,084
you know,

4370
01:43:57,080 --> 01:43:58,190
experimenting with the creepy,

4371
01:43:58,250 --> 01:43:59,083
creepy mustache.

4372
01:43:59,450 --> 01:44:00,440
He's such a good kid though.

4373
01:44:00,530 --> 01:44:00,771
Hello.

4374
01:44:00,771 --> 01:44:02,180
It was a very nice guy,

4375
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:06,470
but I was just super impressed with the
way he handled llamas because llamas is,

4376
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:07,670
he's,

4377
01:44:07,670 --> 01:44:08,120
I mean,

4378
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:12,050
Lama says is well rounded as you're
going to get these wrestlers get great

4379
01:44:12,051 --> 01:44:12,650
striking.

4380
01:44:12,650 --> 01:44:16,910
Great submission skills are like pretty
much does any scene so much that for him

4381
01:44:16,911 --> 01:44:19,100
to win and wind down the stretch,

4382
01:44:19,190 --> 01:44:20,330
like he was overwhelming.

4383
01:44:20,331 --> 01:44:22,700
I'm deep into the sacrament
and the third I was like,

4384
01:44:22,701 --> 01:44:26,810
well this is a guy that's clearly hitting
his stride and [inaudible] next level.

4385
01:44:28,190 --> 01:44:28,371
Yeah,

4386
01:44:28,371 --> 01:44:28,501
he's,

4387
01:44:28,501 --> 01:44:29,334
he did a great job.

4388
01:44:29,690 --> 01:44:33,350
Now when a guy like that it's coming
off of a fight like the Darren Elkins

4389
01:44:33,351 --> 01:44:33,950
fight,

4390
01:44:33,950 --> 01:44:34,281
how do you,

4391
01:44:34,281 --> 01:44:36,260
how do you build them
back up after that fight?

4392
01:44:37,790 --> 01:44:37,971
Well,

4393
01:44:37,971 --> 01:44:38,331
you know what?

4394
01:44:38,331 --> 01:44:42,140
I feel like he was trying to do too much
and he wore himself out in Elkins is

4395
01:44:42,141 --> 01:44:43,880
one of those guys where
if you give them a window,

4396
01:44:43,940 --> 01:44:44,630
the fights over,

4397
01:44:44,630 --> 01:44:44,901
you know,

4398
01:44:44,901 --> 01:44:45,201
he's,

4399
01:44:45,201 --> 01:44:45,890
he's one of those,

4400
01:44:45,890 --> 01:44:47,030
those guys who's dangerous,

4401
01:44:47,031 --> 01:44:49,310
he knows what to do in the right
and the particular situation,

4402
01:44:49,311 --> 01:44:50,144
he's not going to panic.

4403
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:52,010
And he found the right
right moment to beat,

4404
01:44:52,150 --> 01:44:52,500
uh,

4405
01:44:52,500 --> 01:44:56,090
Mirsada but I think just mears that
overworked himself and he didn't find

4406
01:44:56,091 --> 01:44:56,990
pockets too.

4407
01:44:57,140 --> 01:44:59,990
Cause the thing is you cannot exert
yourself at a maximum pace forever.

4408
01:45:00,130 --> 01:45:02,210
We've got to find pockets of
recovery and get back to it.

4409
01:45:02,750 --> 01:45:03,850
I felt like he just a,

4410
01:45:03,870 --> 01:45:05,300
he overextended himself in the fight.

4411
01:45:05,450 --> 01:45:05,631
Yeah.

4412
01:45:05,631 --> 01:45:06,890
I feel like that was the case too.

4413
01:45:06,891 --> 01:45:07,460
But it's,

4414
01:45:07,460 --> 01:45:09,110
how do you know when to,

4415
01:45:09,590 --> 01:45:09,831
I mean,

4416
01:45:09,831 --> 01:45:11,060
how do you know when to push?

4417
01:45:11,090 --> 01:45:13,040
The idea is that you want
to break your opponent,

4418
01:45:13,100 --> 01:45:13,340
right?

4419
01:45:13,340 --> 01:45:15,470
So how do you know when
you're breaking yourself?

4420
01:45:15,680 --> 01:45:18,830
How do you know when your opponent has
too much gas and you're not going to like

4421
01:45:18,831 --> 01:45:22,580
a guy like Elkins is famous for
his durability in his heart,

4422
01:45:22,820 --> 01:45:23,411
so he's a,

4423
01:45:23,411 --> 01:45:24,680
he's an interesting case.

4424
01:45:24,710 --> 01:45:24,891
Yeah,

4425
01:45:24,891 --> 01:45:25,210
I think,

4426
01:45:25,210 --> 01:45:26,930
I think the master of that is George.

4427
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:28,340
George recovers in the realm.

4428
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:31,880
We always talk about recovering in the
round and never showing the guy at your

4429
01:45:31,881 --> 01:45:32,631
maximum point.

4430
01:45:32,631 --> 01:45:35,540
Like let's say we're fighting me and you
and I see you back off because you're

4431
01:45:35,541 --> 01:45:36,140
tired.

4432
01:45:36,140 --> 01:45:37,190
You're huffing and puffing and you sir,

4433
01:45:37,220 --> 01:45:38,480
I know you're breaking point now.

4434
01:45:38,780 --> 01:45:40,730
I know that if I push this
pace a little bit more,

4435
01:45:40,731 --> 01:45:41,301
you're going to break.

4436
01:45:41,301 --> 01:45:42,290
There's no more reserves.

4437
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:43,393
However,

4438
01:45:43,430 --> 01:45:47,480
if you get to about 70% of your fatigue
and then you start circling and I see

4439
01:45:47,481 --> 01:45:47,991
you're circling,

4440
01:45:47,991 --> 01:45:48,950
but I don't see you're fatigued,

4441
01:45:48,951 --> 01:45:49,820
you're just doing that as a,

4442
01:45:49,821 --> 01:45:50,181
as a,

4443
01:45:50,181 --> 01:45:50,900
as a,

4444
01:45:50,900 --> 01:45:51,651
as a decoy.

4445
01:45:51,651 --> 01:45:52,850
You're playing mind games with me,

4446
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:54,620
but really you're recovering.

4447
01:45:56,050 --> 01:45:59,660
You're playing mind games
with me or circling your
tying me up in ways you'd be,

4448
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:03,050
you know that I'm never going to go over
70% I'm never going to red line in a

4449
01:46:03,051 --> 01:46:03,800
fight.

4450
01:46:03,800 --> 01:46:06,920
Only at the last bit of the fight am
I going to red line because I have a

4451
01:46:06,921 --> 01:46:08,600
reserve in case things go wrong.

4452
01:46:08,601 --> 01:46:11,120
I have a reserve to explode out
of a position that I might need,

4453
01:46:11,540 --> 01:46:15,950
so the only times I'll red line is if I'm
in trouble in a fight and a half to go

4454
01:46:15,951 --> 01:46:19,190
all in because the fights can be
over or it's the end of the fight.

4455
01:46:19,660 --> 01:46:21,470
The guys who go all in
and around one for me,

4456
01:46:21,680 --> 01:46:24,380
eventually they will lose because
some guy's going to weather that storm

4457
01:46:24,520 --> 01:46:25,850
sidestep and he's going to,

4458
01:46:25,880 --> 01:46:27,530
he's going to put the
kill on you when you're,

4459
01:46:27,531 --> 01:46:30,830
when you're in recovery mode or like
Francis and Ghana on Steep Immuno Church.

4460
01:46:30,920 --> 01:46:31,753
Right.

4461
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:34,400
Francis came out guns
blazing in the first round.

4462
01:46:34,460 --> 01:46:37,280
Blues Wad exactly in the
second and the third.

4463
01:46:37,310 --> 01:46:37,721
Exactly.

4464
01:46:37,721 --> 01:46:38,554
Bate took over.

4465
01:46:38,600 --> 01:46:39,560
When you go for the kill,

4466
01:46:39,561 --> 01:46:43,340
you're risking losing the
decision or losing afterwards.

4467
01:46:43,340 --> 01:46:44,121
If you don't get the kill,

4468
01:46:44,121 --> 01:46:44,751
if you over extent,

4469
01:46:44,751 --> 01:46:45,584
if you go all in,

4470
01:46:45,650 --> 01:46:46,330
yeah.

4471
01:46:46,330 --> 01:46:47,330
And there's no reserve,

4472
01:46:48,350 --> 01:46:50,130
you better get that kill
because if you don't,

4473
01:46:50,220 --> 01:46:53,280
what's amazing is that when guys
go all in in the first round,

4474
01:46:53,310 --> 01:46:54,420
even if they're in great shape,

4475
01:46:54,421 --> 01:46:56,700
sometimes they don't recover
enough to complete the fight,

4476
01:46:56,760 --> 01:46:57,540
right.

4477
01:46:57,540 --> 01:47:00,630
If the guy they're fighting is
skilled enough to not allow them that,

4478
01:47:00,670 --> 01:47:01,503
yeah.

4479
01:47:02,010 --> 01:47:02,300
You know,

4480
01:47:02,300 --> 01:47:03,240
if you roll with a blue belt,

4481
01:47:03,241 --> 01:47:04,074
you'll never get tired.

4482
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:06,600
He doesn't have the skill to make me work.

4483
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:07,410
Right.

4484
01:47:07,410 --> 01:47:07,771
However,

4485
01:47:07,771 --> 01:47:11,520
if I'm with a black belt and I get
exhausted and now he's making me work,

4486
01:47:11,720 --> 01:47:12,540
right,

4487
01:47:12,540 --> 01:47:13,440
I may never recover.

4488
01:47:13,650 --> 01:47:14,130
Right,

4489
01:47:14,130 --> 01:47:14,580
right.

4490
01:47:14,580 --> 01:47:14,970
Yeah.

4491
01:47:14,970 --> 01:47:15,400
That's uh,

4492
01:47:15,400 --> 01:47:15,710
it's,

4493
01:47:15,710 --> 01:47:15,921
well,

4494
01:47:15,921 --> 01:47:16,754
it's not just,

4495
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:20,610
it's also the way you go out.

4496
01:47:20,640 --> 01:47:22,710
If you go out full clip
in that first round,

4497
01:47:23,070 --> 01:47:23,431
you,

4498
01:47:23,431 --> 01:47:27,810
you have essentially sprinted yourself
into a position where you're just so

4499
01:47:27,811 --> 01:47:28,644
diminished.

4500
01:47:28,950 --> 01:47:30,450
There's so many fighters
that are like that,

4501
01:47:30,451 --> 01:47:30,970
right?

4502
01:47:30,970 --> 01:47:33,090
Like Connor's kind of a good example.

4503
01:47:33,770 --> 01:47:37,110
Connor is fantastic in
the beginning of a fight,

4504
01:47:37,140 --> 01:47:37,590
right.

4505
01:47:37,590 --> 01:47:38,371
But man,

4506
01:47:38,371 --> 01:47:39,480
he gets to them third,

4507
01:47:39,481 --> 01:47:39,841
fourth,

4508
01:47:39,841 --> 01:47:43,080
and fifth rounds and he takes it like
the Nate Diaz fight the second fight.

4509
01:47:43,081 --> 01:47:43,920
He becomes human.

4510
01:47:44,280 --> 01:47:46,020
He turned and walked away from him.

4511
01:47:46,310 --> 01:47:49,530
I mean it was very human
needed that break so badly.

4512
01:47:49,770 --> 01:47:50,850
When you see that,

4513
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:53,580
do you think that that
is a case of putting,

4514
01:47:53,610 --> 01:47:55,020
I don't want you to give away too much,

4515
01:47:55,021 --> 01:47:58,140
cause you know George potentially
wants to fight coming in with the red.

4516
01:47:58,141 --> 01:47:58,860
Right.

4517
01:47:58,860 --> 01:48:03,210
Do you think that that's a
case of poor conditioning?

4518
01:48:03,930 --> 01:48:08,400
Do you think that is a lack of experience
in handling those moments because he's

4519
01:48:08,401 --> 01:48:10,980
so used to overwhelming people
and taking them out early?

4520
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:12,270
What do you think that is?

4521
01:48:12,600 --> 01:48:14,280
I think it's partly genetic.

4522
01:48:14,850 --> 01:48:15,210
Really?

4523
01:48:15,210 --> 01:48:15,451
Yes.

4524
01:48:15,451 --> 01:48:16,680
Because you see,

4525
01:48:16,740 --> 01:48:17,940
I call it the touch of death.

4526
01:48:17,941 --> 01:48:18,900
You know he's got that left hand.

4527
01:48:18,901 --> 01:48:19,734
It's the touch of death.

4528
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:20,610
Yeah.

4529
01:48:20,610 --> 01:48:22,230
That touch of death comes at a cost.

4530
01:48:22,710 --> 01:48:22,980
Okay.

4531
01:48:22,980 --> 01:48:23,940
How do you have the touch of death?

4532
01:48:23,941 --> 01:48:24,930
Where does power come from?

4533
01:48:24,931 --> 01:48:25,081
Okay.

4534
01:48:25,081 --> 01:48:25,231
Well,

4535
01:48:25,231 --> 01:48:27,060
if you look up Michael Colgan
or were talking about earlier,

4536
01:48:27,061 --> 01:48:27,421
he has a,

4537
01:48:27,421 --> 01:48:29,190
he has the criteria for power,

4538
01:48:29,640 --> 01:48:30,690
but to the best of his knowledge,

4539
01:48:30,691 --> 01:48:32,160
this is where he believes
power comes from.

4540
01:48:32,340 --> 01:48:32,551
Okay.

4541
01:48:32,551 --> 01:48:34,890
So I can't teach Hussein
bolt will be powerful.

4542
01:48:34,891 --> 01:48:36,690
I can only make him faster.

4543
01:48:37,170 --> 01:48:38,820
But where did that
initial power come from?

4544
01:48:39,390 --> 01:48:40,500
Number one on the list.

4545
01:48:40,501 --> 01:48:45,120
Number one is where your muscle is
attached to your bowl was genetic.

4546
01:48:45,300 --> 01:48:46,133
So Tyson hits,

4547
01:48:46,260 --> 01:48:47,250
he has a powerful left hook,

4548
01:48:47,251 --> 01:48:49,200
not because his coach taught
him how to hit a left hook.

4549
01:48:49,890 --> 01:48:52,500
He could hit a left hook like that
if you had a mediocre trainer.

4550
01:48:53,100 --> 01:48:56,220
It has to do with the
leverage of his bolts.

4551
01:48:56,250 --> 01:48:57,083
So for instance,

4552
01:48:57,300 --> 01:48:57,541
uh,

4553
01:48:57,541 --> 01:48:57,900
you know,

4554
01:48:57,900 --> 01:48:58,111
if,

4555
01:48:58,111 --> 01:48:59,550
I'm going to imagine how like a,

4556
01:48:59,570 --> 01:49:03,930
like a really heavy poults weighs a
hundred pounds and I want to stand it up,

4557
01:49:03,990 --> 01:49:04,171
well,

4558
01:49:04,171 --> 01:49:08,670
depending on where I grab it and then
have more resistance or less resistance,

4559
01:49:08,671 --> 01:49:09,600
if I grab it near the end,

4560
01:49:09,601 --> 01:49:10,434
they have more leverage.

4561
01:49:10,890 --> 01:49:14,700
So where your muscles attached to your
bone is gonna is gonna dictate how much

4562
01:49:14,701 --> 01:49:15,570
leverage you get out of it.

4563
01:49:16,200 --> 01:49:19,200
Second most important element is
the type of muscle fiber you have,

4564
01:49:19,680 --> 01:49:20,280
the type.

4565
01:49:20,280 --> 01:49:22,260
So if you have a fast twitch muscle fiber,

4566
01:49:23,220 --> 01:49:24,780
you can hold this oxygen,

4567
01:49:24,810 --> 01:49:25,740
but he can switch faster,

4568
01:49:26,220 --> 01:49:27,053
hence the name.

4569
01:49:27,690 --> 01:49:29,490
So if you're a slow
twitch muscle fiber guy,

4570
01:49:30,120 --> 01:49:31,950
you can metabolize more oxygen,

4571
01:49:31,980 --> 01:49:33,150
but she can't twitches fast.

4572
01:49:33,330 --> 01:49:34,350
So there's a give and take.

4573
01:49:34,440 --> 01:49:36,120
Nikki is exactly.

4574
01:49:36,690 --> 01:49:37,291
So you have a guy,

4575
01:49:37,291 --> 01:49:37,681
Nick Diaz,

4576
01:49:37,681 --> 01:49:38,850
who needs to knock you out with volume.

4577
01:49:39,280 --> 01:49:40,440
You can knock you out with one shot.

4578
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:41,400
Let's look at Bj Penn.

4579
01:49:41,640 --> 01:49:42,041
If Ronald,

4580
01:49:42,041 --> 01:49:42,811
when he doesn't lock you out,

4581
01:49:42,811 --> 01:49:43,790
likelihood of knock you out.

4582
01:49:43,810 --> 01:49:44,700
Round two is less,

4583
01:49:44,820 --> 01:49:45,600
right?

4584
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:46,590
Diaz is the opposite.

4585
01:49:46,710 --> 01:49:48,040
The likelihood of him
knocking you out around

4586
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:49,060
three is higher than Ron one.

4587
01:49:49,210 --> 01:49:49,900
Yeah,

4588
01:49:49,900 --> 01:49:51,550
because of the cumulative at the attack.

4589
01:49:51,600 --> 01:49:52,200
Yeah.

4590
01:49:52,200 --> 01:49:53,500
Mcgregor look at his stats.

4591
01:49:53,530 --> 01:49:54,630
It's all around one knockout run.

4592
01:49:54,631 --> 01:49:55,370
One knock out Ron,

4593
01:49:55,370 --> 01:49:55,730
Ron,

4594
01:49:55,730 --> 01:49:57,020
Ron to knock out.

4595
01:49:57,160 --> 01:49:58,120
He's fast twitch.

4596
01:49:58,121 --> 01:49:59,630
High leverage lefthand.

4597
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:00,490
Yeah.

4598
01:50:00,490 --> 01:50:01,900
If you take them into deep waters,

4599
01:50:02,140 --> 01:50:04,800
his fast twitch muscle
fibers cannot metabolize it.

4600
01:50:04,850 --> 01:50:06,640
Been with me whether maybe
where they're so smart.

4601
01:50:06,641 --> 01:50:07,480
He let him work.

4602
01:50:08,410 --> 01:50:12,310
He let McGregor work for three
rounds and you're getting excited.

4603
01:50:12,311 --> 01:50:13,030
Keep working,

4604
01:50:13,030 --> 01:50:13,863
keep working,

4605
01:50:14,200 --> 01:50:15,100
and when you have nothing left,

4606
01:50:15,101 --> 01:50:15,934
I'm going to put you out.

4607
01:50:16,420 --> 01:50:16,660
You know,

4608
01:50:16,660 --> 01:50:16,790
he,

4609
01:50:16,790 --> 01:50:18,040
there was such a brilliant strategy.

4610
01:50:18,490 --> 01:50:19,031
It was,

4611
01:50:19,031 --> 01:50:21,430
and it was so obvious how
much more efficient he was.

4612
01:50:21,490 --> 01:50:21,971
Exactly.

4613
01:50:21,971 --> 01:50:22,210
No,

4614
01:50:22,210 --> 01:50:23,590
and more relaxed.

4615
01:50:23,591 --> 01:50:26,300
Connor had his moments
early in the fight where he,

4616
01:50:26,301 --> 01:50:27,160
he hit him with someone,

4617
01:50:27,170 --> 01:50:28,930
an unorthodox punches and some,

4618
01:50:29,350 --> 01:50:30,400
some weird movement.

4619
01:50:30,401 --> 01:50:31,930
But after a while it was just,

4620
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:34,810
I found both of them had a brilliant
performance cause when Mcgregor did to go

4621
01:50:34,811 --> 01:50:35,590
in his world,

4622
01:50:35,590 --> 01:50:36,270
oh crap.

4623
01:50:36,270 --> 01:50:37,103
It's brilliant.

4624
01:50:37,180 --> 01:50:37,780
It was brilliant.

4625
01:50:37,780 --> 01:50:40,600
Just crazy crazy that
that had even happened.

4626
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:41,291
Really.

4627
01:50:41,291 --> 01:50:42,150
Stop and think about it.

4628
01:50:42,151 --> 01:50:44,050
It's almost like the
world got a magic trick.

4629
01:50:44,140 --> 01:50:44,973
It was unbelievable.

4630
01:50:45,070 --> 01:50:46,230
I want George to fight Mayweather.

4631
01:50:46,240 --> 01:50:47,230
I keep bothering you.

4632
01:50:47,240 --> 01:50:47,920
Fight me with it.

4633
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:48,753
You fight it.

4634
01:50:49,230 --> 01:50:49,481
He's like,

4635
01:50:49,481 --> 01:50:49,931
it's crazy.

4636
01:50:49,931 --> 01:50:50,764
I know it's crazy,

4637
01:50:51,130 --> 01:50:52,960
but I bet may whether it would do it.

4638
01:50:53,980 --> 01:50:54,671
That's what I'm saying.

4639
01:50:54,671 --> 01:50:56,440
George might have to lose
a shitload of weight.

4640
01:50:56,470 --> 01:50:56,571
Yeah,

4641
01:50:56,571 --> 01:50:57,550
they'll find a catch weight.

4642
01:50:57,580 --> 01:50:58,470
Do you think Mayweather?

4643
01:50:58,480 --> 01:50:59,020
His word,

4644
01:50:59,020 --> 01:50:59,801
he's going to get concussed.

4645
01:50:59,801 --> 01:51:01,600
He's fought all the top
punches in the world.

4646
01:51:01,780 --> 01:51:02,170
Right.

4647
01:51:02,170 --> 01:51:04,270
He's just gonna have to worry
about George's volume in reach,

4648
01:51:04,300 --> 01:51:06,580
but he can handle himself and
George can have the limb itself,

4649
01:51:07,060 --> 01:51:08,830
but the whole world is
going to tune into that one.

4650
01:51:09,130 --> 01:51:09,963
You know what I'm saying?

4651
01:51:10,030 --> 01:51:11,260
I like George is selling it like,

4652
01:51:11,261 --> 01:51:12,094
yeah,

4653
01:51:12,190 --> 01:51:12,551
do it,

4654
01:51:12,551 --> 01:51:12,820
man.

4655
01:51:12,820 --> 01:51:13,151
Do it.

4656
01:51:13,151 --> 01:51:14,500
But George doesn't want to fight.

4657
01:51:14,501 --> 01:51:16,690
A smaller guy doesn't want
to call out a smarter guy,

4658
01:51:16,691 --> 01:51:18,100
so it's going to have to come from me.

4659
01:51:18,101 --> 01:51:19,830
Whether it's going to have to file.

4660
01:51:20,290 --> 01:51:21,910
There's another big money fight.

4661
01:51:21,940 --> 01:51:22,300
Yep.

4662
01:51:22,300 --> 01:51:24,040
But is it a bit as big a money fight?

4663
01:51:24,070 --> 01:51:24,880
That's the thing.

4664
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:29,560
The real big money fight is in somehow
or another McGregor convincing the world

4665
01:51:29,561 --> 01:51:30,880
that he could beat him
in the second fight.

4666
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:32,370
Like I know there were weather.

4667
01:51:32,530 --> 01:51:33,363
Yes.

4668
01:51:33,430 --> 01:51:34,201
That's a hard sell.

4669
01:51:34,201 --> 01:51:35,034
It's a hard sell.

4670
01:51:35,140 --> 01:51:36,070
We bought that one already.

4671
01:51:36,160 --> 01:51:36,993
Yeah,

4672
01:51:37,300 --> 01:51:38,160
we bought that one,

4673
01:51:39,130 --> 01:51:39,460
George,

4674
01:51:39,460 --> 01:51:40,210
to fight Mcgregor.

4675
01:51:40,210 --> 01:51:43,450
There was the one thing of doing it
in the octagon and doing it with small

4676
01:51:43,451 --> 01:51:45,580
gloves and no kicks.

4677
01:51:45,640 --> 01:51:46,390
I remember there was,

4678
01:51:46,390 --> 01:51:48,340
there was some talk of
that and people were like,

4679
01:51:48,341 --> 01:51:48,441
well,

4680
01:51:48,441 --> 01:51:49,480
where's this talk coming from?

4681
01:51:49,481 --> 01:51:50,770
I don't know if it was legit or not.

4682
01:51:50,770 --> 01:51:51,521
I called Dana.

4683
01:51:51,521 --> 01:51:52,001
Dana said,

4684
01:51:52,001 --> 01:51:53,530
it's 100% bullshit,

4685
01:51:54,290 --> 01:51:56,380
but I'm getting the
state can enforce that.

4686
01:51:56,840 --> 01:51:58,120
If Mcgregor wants to throw a kick,

4687
01:51:58,121 --> 01:51:58,870
he'll throw a kick.

4688
01:51:58,870 --> 01:51:59,703
Right.

4689
01:51:59,830 --> 01:52:00,880
It has to be gentleman's rule.

4690
01:52:00,881 --> 01:52:03,520
Do you remember when that happened
with Tim Silvia and Ray Mercer?

4691
01:52:04,240 --> 01:52:04,990
No.

4692
01:52:04,990 --> 01:52:09,010
Tim Silvia fought Ray Mercer and they
had originally been scheduled to fight a

4693
01:52:09,011 --> 01:52:10,450
boxing match Edelman's rules,

4694
01:52:10,451 --> 01:52:14,620
but the commission said they wouldn't
sanction the fight because Tim Silvia

4695
01:52:14,621 --> 01:52:16,090
doesn't have any pro boxing experience.

4696
01:52:16,091 --> 01:52:21,091
Ray Mercer Olympic gold medal as former
world champion and they decided to have

4697
01:52:21,791 --> 01:52:22,630
an MMA fight,

4698
01:52:22,660 --> 01:52:25,450
but they had a gentleman's
agreement to not throw kicks.

4699
01:52:25,630 --> 01:52:28,060
Tim Opens up with an inside leg kick.

4700
01:52:28,360 --> 01:52:29,380
You ever seen a fight?

4701
01:52:29,550 --> 01:52:29,680
They,

4702
01:52:29,680 --> 01:52:30,960
I did this.

4703
01:52:31,150 --> 01:52:32,290
I just forgot about the chick.

4704
01:52:32,470 --> 01:52:35,050
It starts off and Tim Silvia immediately.

4705
01:52:35,080 --> 01:52:35,231
Oh,

4706
01:52:35,231 --> 01:52:36,640
this is go before this,

4707
01:52:36,670 --> 01:52:36,821
go.

4708
01:52:36,821 --> 01:52:37,601
Before this cause this is,

4709
01:52:37,601 --> 01:52:38,470
that's the Kao.

4710
01:52:38,890 --> 01:52:40,150
If you go before this,

4711
01:52:40,151 --> 01:52:44,710
they open up and Tim kicks him right
away and let ray see raid puts his hands

4712
01:52:44,711 --> 01:52:44,930
down.

4713
01:52:44,930 --> 01:52:45,800
Your mother fucker.

4714
01:52:45,801 --> 01:52:47,150
I can't believe this shit.

4715
01:52:47,450 --> 01:52:47,871
Oh,

4716
01:52:47,871 --> 01:52:49,040
that's why he didn't give a look.

4717
01:52:50,600 --> 01:52:51,590
And then he hit some ways down.

4718
01:52:51,620 --> 01:52:52,740
He's just share.

4719
01:52:53,300 --> 01:52:54,140
Oh Zim,

4720
01:52:54,370 --> 01:52:55,340
let me see that one more time.

4721
01:52:55,370 --> 01:52:57,530
Oh boom.

4722
01:52:57,531 --> 01:52:59,120
I mean come on son.

4723
01:52:59,150 --> 01:53:01,970
And that's like a 50 year
old ray Mercer at the tile.

4724
01:53:02,710 --> 01:53:03,170
Wow.

4725
01:53:03,170 --> 01:53:03,861
Ray.

4726
01:53:03,861 --> 01:53:04,190
He,

4727
01:53:04,190 --> 01:53:05,150
that's why he gave him that look.

4728
01:53:05,151 --> 01:53:05,960
He was like,

4729
01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:06,860
he couldn't believe it.

4730
01:53:06,861 --> 01:53:07,161
He's like,

4731
01:53:07,161 --> 01:53:08,930
I thought we weren't kicking man.

4732
01:53:09,140 --> 01:53:11,900
So they have made a gentleman's
agreement and Tim Silvia was like,

4733
01:53:11,930 --> 01:53:12,410
yeah,

4734
01:53:12,410 --> 01:53:13,460
whatever dude.

4735
01:53:14,900 --> 01:53:16,220
But he paid for that.

4736
01:53:17,030 --> 01:53:18,590
I mean he got starched.

4737
01:53:18,860 --> 01:53:19,400
That was,

4738
01:53:19,400 --> 01:53:19,970
that's,

4739
01:53:19,970 --> 01:53:22,340
it's also the difference in skill level.

4740
01:53:22,341 --> 01:53:27,320
You see a guy like ray Mercer who's seen
all these patterns and a guy like Tim

4741
01:53:27,320 --> 01:53:30,050
Silvia has just so used
to MMA fighters striking.

4742
01:53:31,310 --> 01:53:32,010
It's a different,

4743
01:53:32,010 --> 01:53:32,691
different speed.

4744
01:53:32,691 --> 01:53:33,140
Also.

4745
01:53:33,140 --> 01:53:33,620
It is.

4746
01:53:33,620 --> 01:53:38,620
How much does it help fighters to cross
train in these different disciplines and

4747
01:53:39,591 --> 01:53:43,930
how difficult is it to take those skills
and then to put them into their overall

4748
01:53:43,931 --> 01:53:44,764
MMA game?

4749
01:53:44,780 --> 01:53:47,420
I think it's beneficial if you do it to
a certain degree because if you go too

4750
01:53:47,421 --> 01:53:47,751
much less,

4751
01:53:47,751 --> 01:53:49,310
he always spargel pro boxers.

4752
01:53:49,610 --> 01:53:50,391
There's a distance.

4753
01:53:50,391 --> 01:53:53,870
It's not realistic because in MMA
you're further away from each other.

4754
01:53:54,230 --> 01:53:54,800
Yeah,

4755
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:56,140
so when I get to that distance,

4756
01:53:56,141 --> 01:53:56,974
the guy's going to grab me.

4757
01:53:57,350 --> 01:53:57,830
However,

4758
01:53:57,830 --> 01:53:59,420
because there's more punches per second.

4759
01:54:01,010 --> 01:54:02,630
It's more of an intensive training.

4760
01:54:03,380 --> 01:54:05,090
So if you can deal with
that speed of training,

4761
01:54:05,091 --> 01:54:06,420
then later when I put you in MMA zone,

4762
01:54:06,430 --> 01:54:07,460
when it's slower a little bit.

4763
01:54:07,670 --> 01:54:08,600
So there's that element.

4764
01:54:08,601 --> 01:54:11,150
There's a balancing act as
there's a boxing with a pro boxer,

4765
01:54:11,151 --> 01:54:14,240
but then there's doing it too much that
when you're sparring with MMA fighter,

4766
01:54:14,241 --> 01:54:14,841
it's harder to hit.

4767
01:54:14,841 --> 01:54:16,700
That may may fighter than it
is for me to hit the boxer.

4768
01:54:16,850 --> 01:54:17,330
Right,

4769
01:54:17,330 --> 01:54:19,190
because we're in a different
pattern were different worlds.

4770
01:54:19,400 --> 01:54:20,600
I want to do just a bit of that.

4771
01:54:21,050 --> 01:54:21,883
Not Too much.

4772
01:54:22,160 --> 01:54:22,461
Is there,

4773
01:54:22,461 --> 01:54:27,461
are there any patterns that people pick
up in boxing that become a real problem

4774
01:54:27,621 --> 01:54:28,820
when you add in elbows?

4775
01:54:28,821 --> 01:54:29,654
Yeah.

4776
01:54:29,660 --> 01:54:29,841
Yeah.

4777
01:54:29,841 --> 01:54:30,740
When you ducked down,

4778
01:54:30,741 --> 01:54:31,460
some guys just start,

4779
01:54:31,460 --> 01:54:31,700
okay,

4780
01:54:31,700 --> 01:54:32,181
you throw up your hand.

4781
01:54:32,181 --> 01:54:32,901
I'm going to duck down.

4782
01:54:32,901 --> 01:54:33,171
Dude,

4783
01:54:33,171 --> 01:54:34,250
you do that once with me.

4784
01:54:34,251 --> 01:54:35,590
I'm throwing a left
kick right after Moran.

4785
01:54:35,591 --> 01:54:38,510
I'm throwing a shallow right hand and
the left kicks coming upstairs and when

4786
01:54:38,511 --> 01:54:39,940
you slip you're slipping
right into the kick.

4787
01:54:39,950 --> 01:54:40,611
Jon Jones.

4788
01:54:40,611 --> 01:54:41,450
Daniel Cormier.

4789
01:54:41,510 --> 01:54:42,021
Exactly.

4790
01:54:42,021 --> 01:54:45,830
I mean that was a pattern that John
had seen and they even talked about it

4791
01:54:45,950 --> 01:54:47,600
beforehand with Dennis said,

4792
01:54:47,601 --> 01:54:49,640
don't think you're going to hit
me with that left high kick,

4793
01:54:50,330 --> 01:54:53,000
which is kind of crazy when
you see how it went down.

4794
01:54:53,840 --> 01:54:54,440
Yeah.

4795
01:54:54,440 --> 01:54:58,820
That's a weird thing when people just
develop a sort of pattern that they just

4796
01:54:58,821 --> 01:55:01,490
keep repeating over and over
again and then it's instinctual.

4797
01:55:02,210 --> 01:55:03,110
You want to take it out now?

4798
01:55:03,170 --> 01:55:03,500
Ooh,

4799
01:55:03,500 --> 01:55:03,920
good luck.

4800
01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:04,371
Good luck.

4801
01:55:04,371 --> 01:55:05,204
Taken it out.

4802
01:55:05,510 --> 01:55:06,230
This and that.

4803
01:55:06,230 --> 01:55:11,120
That's one of the things that when
you see people learning technique,

4804
01:55:11,150 --> 01:55:16,150
one of the more difficult things is to
relearn something once you learn it.

4805
01:55:16,371 --> 01:55:17,204
One way,

4806
01:55:17,420 --> 01:55:22,420
like with the kicking in particular
when they get tired or when they get

4807
01:55:22,971 --> 01:55:23,600
nervous,

4808
01:55:23,600 --> 01:55:27,770
they revert back to their old way
of kicking and you you see it.

4809
01:55:28,100 --> 01:55:29,240
Especially if they learned it young.

4810
01:55:29,360 --> 01:55:29,780
Yeah,

4811
01:55:29,780 --> 01:55:30,613
it's hardwired.

4812
01:55:31,220 --> 01:55:31,460
Yeah.

4813
01:55:31,460 --> 01:55:32,780
How do you get a guy out of that?

4814
01:55:32,870 --> 01:55:34,460
I haven't been very successful.

4815
01:55:34,461 --> 01:55:34,910
Like for instance,

4816
01:55:34,910 --> 01:55:37,970
if I take a guy who has been kicking
taekwondo his entire life and then I tried

4817
01:55:37,971 --> 01:55:38,870
to teach him a Thai kick,

4818
01:55:38,900 --> 01:55:39,733
it's not that easy.

4819
01:55:39,770 --> 01:55:40,431
It's really difficult.

4820
01:55:40,431 --> 01:55:40,790
Yeah.

4821
01:55:40,790 --> 01:55:42,890
That's why I believe when you're
young you have to have a diversity.

4822
01:55:42,891 --> 01:55:44,100
You have learn how to kick like a tie,

4823
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:44,881
like a taekwondo guy,

4824
01:55:44,881 --> 01:55:45,571
like a karate guy,

4825
01:55:45,571 --> 01:55:46,500
like a kickboxer,

4826
01:55:46,860 --> 01:55:47,401
the variety,

4827
01:55:47,401 --> 01:55:49,920
and then you can go out there
and you can morph your style.

4828
01:55:50,790 --> 01:55:53,340
You can exchange from one
style of kicking to another.

4829
01:55:53,880 --> 01:55:54,241
However,

4830
01:55:54,241 --> 01:55:58,080
if you've done 10 years of one way
and you are hardwired that way,

4831
01:55:58,620 --> 01:55:59,401
it's very difficult.

4832
01:55:59,401 --> 01:56:00,690
Almost not worth it to we do it.

4833
01:56:00,691 --> 01:56:02,370
Just let him kick the way he kicks real.

4834
01:56:02,430 --> 01:56:02,760
Yeah.

4835
01:56:02,760 --> 01:56:03,570
It's not worth it.

4836
01:56:03,570 --> 01:56:04,380
Not Worth it.

4837
01:56:04,380 --> 01:56:04,561
No,

4838
01:56:04,561 --> 01:56:06,240
because you're going to treat
him for him for so many hours.

4839
01:56:06,241 --> 01:56:06,851
Then he's going to go in there.

4840
01:56:06,851 --> 01:56:07,561
He's going to revert back.

4841
01:56:07,561 --> 01:56:08,280
Like you said,

4842
01:56:08,280 --> 01:56:11,190
when he's under the pressure and the
stress is going to revert back to what he

4843
01:56:11,460 --> 01:56:14,760
normally does when he's a little bit
tired because it's more efficient for him.

4844
01:56:15,100 --> 01:56:15,933
Mm.

4845
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:18,000
So you're asking him
now to do something new.

4846
01:56:18,750 --> 01:56:21,150
Is there any way to
rewire a person's brain?

4847
01:56:21,210 --> 01:56:22,230
Not that I know of.

4848
01:56:22,231 --> 01:56:22,441
Not,

4849
01:56:22,441 --> 01:56:23,130
not in that.

4850
01:56:23,130 --> 01:56:23,680
Not.

4851
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:24,181
Of course you can.

4852
01:56:24,181 --> 01:56:25,320
You can change someone's behavior.

4853
01:56:25,321 --> 01:56:26,154
Absolutely.

4854
01:56:26,280 --> 01:56:28,530
But if it's hardwired from a young age,

4855
01:56:29,340 --> 01:56:30,840
we're talking about it's
a long term project.

4856
01:56:31,020 --> 01:56:32,910
Do you have the amount
of time you could do it?

4857
01:56:32,911 --> 01:56:35,400
But it's a lot of time and
energy and it's painful.

4858
01:56:36,030 --> 01:56:37,680
It's painful to undo an old way.

4859
01:56:38,700 --> 01:56:39,360
Yeah.

4860
01:56:39,360 --> 01:56:40,290
It's a lot of energy.

4861
01:56:40,291 --> 01:56:42,420
The guy will feel tired
of the Gulf feel sluggish,

4862
01:56:42,421 --> 01:56:45,840
like I'll feel uncomfortable because
he's doing something inefficient.

4863
01:56:46,590 --> 01:56:50,490
You see those patterns though where
where you watch a guy fight and you go,

4864
01:56:50,491 --> 01:56:50,941
man,

4865
01:56:50,941 --> 01:56:52,110
why does he always do that?

4866
01:56:52,111 --> 01:56:57,111
He's always throwing these wide looping
punches like why can he throw a fish,

4867
01:56:57,840 --> 01:56:59,760
smooth technical punches.

4868
01:56:59,790 --> 01:57:00,623
He might've learned,

4869
01:57:00,630 --> 01:57:00,821
I've,

4870
01:57:00,821 --> 01:57:01,560
I've had that problem.

4871
01:57:01,560 --> 01:57:03,330
They learned that wrong
early on in the career.

4872
01:57:03,331 --> 01:57:04,141
Then when they get to you,

4873
01:57:04,141 --> 01:57:05,280
they're good enough to get to you.

4874
01:57:05,280 --> 01:57:05,971
They're good enough to,

4875
01:57:05,971 --> 01:57:06,630
you know,

4876
01:57:06,630 --> 01:57:07,770
come near the UFC another other.

4877
01:57:07,771 --> 01:57:11,070
They want that next level and you're
working with this new athlete who has so

4878
01:57:11,071 --> 01:57:12,630
many inefficiencies.

4879
01:57:13,500 --> 01:57:15,810
You've got to remove
them one by one gently.

4880
01:57:16,020 --> 01:57:16,950
If you try to re haul him,

4881
01:57:16,951 --> 01:57:19,650
you just confused him and he just
doesn't know what to do anymore.

4882
01:57:19,680 --> 01:57:20,790
What do you want me to do coach?

4883
01:57:20,850 --> 01:57:21,840
Like I'm totally lost.

4884
01:57:22,420 --> 01:57:22,870
It's,

4885
01:57:22,870 --> 01:57:23,371
it's like a,

4886
01:57:23,371 --> 01:57:24,600
it's like a scientific experiment,

4887
01:57:24,601 --> 01:57:24,721
right?

4888
01:57:24,721 --> 01:57:25,980
You isolate one variable.

4889
01:57:26,640 --> 01:57:27,570
If you change too many things,

4890
01:57:27,571 --> 01:57:29,040
we don't know what caused
what anymore and you're in it.

4891
01:57:29,041 --> 01:57:29,970
You're in a chaotic,

4892
01:57:29,971 --> 01:57:31,500
now you're now you're in a world of chaos.

4893
01:57:32,040 --> 01:57:33,210
He doesn't know what works anymore.

4894
01:57:33,211 --> 01:57:34,050
You don't know what's wrong.

4895
01:57:34,051 --> 01:57:34,330
Anyway,

4896
01:57:34,330 --> 01:57:35,970
w one thing at a time.

4897
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:39,450
We don't want to flood you and we don't
want to bottleneck queue what we're

4898
01:57:39,451 --> 01:57:39,721
taking.

4899
01:57:39,721 --> 01:57:41,010
You go from one place to another,

4900
01:57:41,011 --> 01:57:44,070
one step at a time gently
and you have to ask yourself,

4901
01:57:44,071 --> 01:57:45,690
what's the one thing I
can help this guy with?

4902
01:57:45,690 --> 01:57:47,140
The one thing they had,

4903
01:57:47,290 --> 01:57:48,630
they'll change the rest of the system.

4904
01:57:48,631 --> 01:57:49,620
This is the most important thing.

4905
01:57:50,040 --> 01:57:51,570
And let's do that one thing at a time.

4906
01:57:52,830 --> 01:57:54,660
So when you see a guy and say,

4907
01:57:54,661 --> 01:57:54,841
look,

4908
01:57:54,841 --> 01:57:58,440
he's got a kill Christian background
or something like that and you see he

4909
01:57:58,441 --> 01:58:00,720
throws kicks but he keeps
landing with the instep.

4910
01:58:01,200 --> 01:58:02,790
You just let him keep doing it like that.

4911
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:03,420
Um,

4912
01:58:03,420 --> 01:58:04,253
yeah.

4913
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:06,900
It depends how many years he has and how
much time we have before the next fight

4914
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:07,980
because I believe it can work.

4915
01:58:07,981 --> 01:58:08,370
It works.

4916
01:58:08,370 --> 01:58:10,320
The reason why karate is still
here is because it worked,

4917
01:58:10,410 --> 01:58:11,161
right guys.

4918
01:58:11,161 --> 01:58:12,180
One right.

4919
01:58:12,181 --> 01:58:12,421
You know,

4920
01:58:12,421 --> 01:58:13,250
it's exists.

4921
01:58:13,250 --> 01:58:13,641
Friday's not,

4922
01:58:13,641 --> 01:58:14,440
and it's not a bad spasm.

4923
01:58:14,440 --> 01:58:14,820
It works.

4924
01:58:14,820 --> 01:58:15,653
If you can make it work,

4925
01:58:16,170 --> 01:58:20,160
I might teach a quality guys in boxing
and then his karate will shine even more

4926
01:58:20,250 --> 01:58:21,120
cause he could bust.

4927
01:58:21,300 --> 01:58:22,020
Yeah,

4928
01:58:22,020 --> 01:58:23,730
that does seem to be the problem is when,

4929
01:58:24,030 --> 01:58:24,480
I mean,

4930
01:58:24,480 --> 01:58:24,990
um,

4931
01:58:24,990 --> 01:58:26,610
taekwondo guides in particular,

4932
01:58:26,970 --> 01:58:28,500
they don't punch to the face.

4933
01:58:28,501 --> 01:58:31,860
So when they get into sparring situations
and they're first learning how to do

4934
01:58:31,861 --> 01:58:31,991
it,

4935
01:58:31,991 --> 01:58:34,560
and we saw that with Raymond
Daniels early in his career as well,

4936
01:58:35,010 --> 01:58:37,160
just have the hardest time with hands.

4937
01:58:37,670 --> 01:58:38,310
Mm.

4938
01:58:38,310 --> 01:58:42,010
So do you take a guy like that
and just have them only box or,

4939
01:58:42,310 --> 01:58:45,550
I would make them bucks a lot and
that'll open up his kicks even more.

4940
01:58:45,940 --> 01:58:46,840
Definitely no doubt about it.

4941
01:58:46,841 --> 01:58:48,310
Especially with his reach and his,

4942
01:58:48,311 --> 01:58:48,671
his,

4943
01:58:48,671 --> 01:58:48,910
uh,

4944
01:58:48,910 --> 01:58:49,481
his distance,

4945
01:58:49,481 --> 01:58:50,440
his foot work that he has.

4946
01:58:50,441 --> 01:58:50,981
You can look,

4947
01:58:50,981 --> 01:58:51,814
uh,

4948
01:58:51,850 --> 01:58:52,571
he could do a lot more,

4949
01:58:52,571 --> 01:58:53,404
I think.

4950
01:58:53,650 --> 01:58:55,480
Do you write all this stuff down?

4951
01:58:55,481 --> 01:58:56,620
Like your thoughts on these things?

4952
01:58:56,621 --> 01:58:58,870
I know you do your youtube
series and you have,

4953
01:58:58,900 --> 01:59:01,270
but have you ever considered
putting out a book on your ideas?

4954
01:59:01,980 --> 01:59:02,801
I'm writing a book,

4955
01:59:02,801 --> 01:59:03,580
but it's more fun.

4956
01:59:03,580 --> 01:59:04,690
It's more of a philosophy book.

4957
01:59:05,110 --> 01:59:06,360
Then next I have a background philosophy.

4958
01:59:06,370 --> 01:59:07,151
Have a degree in philosophy.

4959
01:59:07,151 --> 01:59:09,580
So I spend a lot of time
just contemplating things.

4960
01:59:09,581 --> 01:59:11,650
So I do a lot of fight philosophy stuff.

4961
01:59:11,651 --> 01:59:12,484
I write it down,

4962
01:59:12,880 --> 01:59:13,560
publish a book,

4963
01:59:13,560 --> 01:59:15,130
not really interested in
that to be honest with you.

4964
01:59:15,131 --> 01:59:17,410
I'm more interested in
going in philosophy,

4965
01:59:17,411 --> 01:59:18,310
writing about philosophy,

4966
01:59:18,640 --> 01:59:19,600
not so much MMA,

4967
01:59:19,870 --> 01:59:20,970
like philosophy,

4968
01:59:21,350 --> 01:59:22,000
uh,

4969
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:23,470
more about chew with reality,

4970
01:59:23,480 --> 01:59:24,281
a paradigms,

4971
01:59:24,281 --> 01:59:24,521
you know,

4972
01:59:24,521 --> 01:59:24,641
how,

4973
01:59:24,641 --> 01:59:25,690
how we see the world,

4974
01:59:25,840 --> 01:59:26,250
you know,

4975
01:59:26,250 --> 01:59:27,130
what is truth,

4976
01:59:27,131 --> 01:59:27,761
what is reality,

4977
01:59:27,761 --> 01:59:28,270
those kinds of things.

4978
01:59:28,270 --> 01:59:30,070
I know it sounds weird that's
coming from an MMA coach,

4979
01:59:30,071 --> 01:59:31,930
but I do a lot of philosophy on my own,

4980
01:59:32,070 --> 01:59:32,800
in my own personal life.

4981
01:59:32,800 --> 01:59:34,060
I don't think it's weird at all.

4982
01:59:34,090 --> 01:59:39,090
I mean I think that what
you do is essentially your
taking fighters in preparing

4983
01:59:39,491 --> 01:59:43,270
them for one of the most difficult
challenges in all professional sports.

4984
01:59:43,700 --> 01:59:44,980
And I don't think there's,

4985
01:59:45,370 --> 01:59:47,080
I don't think there's a
more difficult challenge.

4986
01:59:47,081 --> 01:59:48,700
It's outside of war.

4987
01:59:48,940 --> 01:59:49,181
Yeah,

4988
01:59:49,181 --> 01:59:49,591
exactly.

4989
01:59:49,591 --> 01:59:49,750
No.

4990
01:59:49,750 --> 01:59:53,470
Or being a firefighter or a police officer
where you actually putting your life

4991
01:59:53,471 --> 01:59:54,304
in danger.

4992
01:59:55,060 --> 01:59:55,510
I think.

4993
01:59:55,510 --> 01:59:55,960
Yeah,

4994
01:59:55,960 --> 01:59:57,430
combat sports or just,

4995
01:59:57,431 --> 02:00:02,431
it's extremely difficult to do and to
be able to do like what you've done with

4996
02:00:02,441 --> 02:00:04,450
George and what George has done as well.

4997
02:00:04,451 --> 02:00:05,830
I mean what you guys have done together,

4998
02:00:05,831 --> 02:00:10,831
it's just an incredible accomplishment
and especially him coming back after four

4999
02:00:11,411 --> 02:00:14,650
years off and looking better
than he ever looked in the past.

5000
02:00:14,890 --> 02:00:19,890
That was what was crazy when he came back
and the fluidity of his combinations,

5001
02:00:21,101 --> 02:00:24,100
the way he looked and the way
he sunk that rear naked choke,

5002
02:00:24,520 --> 02:00:29,520
that was a rare rear naked choke and MMA
where the blade of the hand was on the

5003
02:00:29,741 --> 02:00:32,680
back of the neck and it
was just fully sunk in.

5004
02:00:32,710 --> 02:00:35,770
You know that that you don't
really see guys get the choke,

5005
02:00:35,771 --> 02:00:40,090
but you're seeing that old school Ken
shamrock style back on their attempt to

5006
02:00:40,091 --> 02:00:40,924
this.

5007
02:00:41,020 --> 02:00:41,890
I'll never talk to this.

5008
02:00:42,010 --> 02:00:45,850
You put me on if the hand's is not behind
[inaudible] you'd rather get put put

5009
02:00:45,851 --> 02:00:46,270
out.

5010
02:00:46,270 --> 02:00:46,541
It's funny,

5011
02:00:46,541 --> 02:00:50,190
I was reading one of my students
yesterday and I let him take him out.

5012
02:00:50,191 --> 02:00:54,190
Like I was kind of toying with him and
let him take my back and he was stronger

5013
02:00:54,191 --> 02:00:54,611
than I thought.

5014
02:00:54,611 --> 02:00:55,800
He was like he,

5015
02:00:55,801 --> 02:00:57,220
I haven't wrestled with him in 10 years.

5016
02:00:57,220 --> 02:00:58,690
I just put out a youtube
video of me and him.

5017
02:00:58,990 --> 02:01:00,070
If you guys want to put it up,

5018
02:01:00,100 --> 02:01:00,933
it would be funny,

5019
02:01:01,120 --> 02:01:01,730
but this is,

5020
02:01:01,730 --> 02:01:04,960
we were rolling off camera and I kind
of let him take my back and I never give

5021
02:01:04,961 --> 02:01:05,411
up my bag,

5022
02:01:05,411 --> 02:01:06,620
but sometimes I know he's probably about,

5023
02:01:06,621 --> 02:01:10,480
so I'll just kind of toying with him a
little and he put a choke kid and I was

5024
02:01:10,481 --> 02:01:10,601
like,

5025
02:01:10,601 --> 02:01:11,080
okay,

5026
02:01:11,080 --> 02:01:11,913
let's see if he can finish.

5027
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:13,000
I didn't think he could finish it.

5028
02:01:13,001 --> 02:01:16,420
Then all of a sudden you've got in deeper
and he didn't have the hand behind my

5029
02:01:16,421 --> 02:01:16,581
head,

5030
02:01:16,581 --> 02:01:16,841
so I was like,

5031
02:01:16,841 --> 02:01:17,674
I'm not going to tap.

5032
02:01:17,770 --> 02:01:18,311
No Way.

5033
02:01:18,311 --> 02:01:19,510
I would have to this impossible.

5034
02:01:19,540 --> 02:01:19,811
First of all,

5035
02:01:19,811 --> 02:01:20,644
he should know better.

5036
02:01:20,890 --> 02:01:21,580
Okay.

5037
02:01:21,580 --> 02:01:22,720
If I let them tap me with this,

5038
02:01:22,721 --> 02:01:23,620
he's gonna think he did it right.

5039
02:01:23,860 --> 02:01:24,311
So I was like,

5040
02:01:24,311 --> 02:01:24,460
no.

5041
02:01:24,460 --> 02:01:25,060
But I was like,

5042
02:01:25,060 --> 02:01:25,390
eh.

5043
02:01:25,390 --> 02:01:26,480
And then when he took a breath,

5044
02:01:26,481 --> 02:01:26,860
I just took,

5045
02:01:26,860 --> 02:01:28,480
I just took his hand out
because I could reach your hand.

5046
02:01:28,481 --> 02:01:28,631
Right.

5047
02:01:28,631 --> 02:01:29,730
It's not tucked away behind it.

5048
02:01:29,940 --> 02:01:30,773
And I got out.

5049
02:01:30,790 --> 02:01:31,750
I'll never talked to this man.

5050
02:01:31,780 --> 02:01:32,470
Never.

5051
02:01:32,470 --> 02:01:33,910
So he's doing this.

5052
02:01:33,990 --> 02:01:34,210
Yeah.

5053
02:01:34,210 --> 02:01:34,571
His hand,

5054
02:01:34,571 --> 02:01:34,841
he's like,

5055
02:01:34,841 --> 02:01:36,970
here it has to be here.

5056
02:01:36,971 --> 02:01:39,650
That MMA gloves or uh,

5057
02:01:39,730 --> 02:01:39,880
no,

5058
02:01:39,880 --> 02:01:40,260
no,

5059
02:01:40,260 --> 02:01:40,490
flow.

5060
02:01:40,490 --> 02:01:40,950
Fluor full.

5061
02:01:40,950 --> 02:01:41,730
Really?

5062
02:01:41,730 --> 02:01:41,950
Yeah.

5063
02:01:41,950 --> 02:01:42,890
He's a good purple belt.

5064
02:01:42,900 --> 02:01:43,371
He's tough guy.

5065
02:01:43,371 --> 02:01:44,151
Very good shape.

5066
02:01:44,151 --> 02:01:44,630
Strong.

5067
02:01:44,630 --> 02:01:46,610
And the is not in the zoo.

5068
02:01:46,640 --> 02:01:47,473
That was off camera,

5069
02:01:47,690 --> 02:01:48,860
but I mean,

5070
02:01:48,890 --> 02:01:53,390
I would never talk to this like even in
practice because it's not on the choke

5071
02:01:53,391 --> 02:01:54,080
is not on,

5072
02:01:54,080 --> 02:01:54,471
right,

5073
02:01:54,471 --> 02:01:54,741
right,

5074
02:01:54,741 --> 02:01:55,574
right.

5075
02:01:55,670 --> 02:01:56,091
Yeah.

5076
02:01:56,091 --> 02:01:57,320
There's definitely a difference,

5077
02:01:57,321 --> 02:02:01,490
but some guys have gotten it even
in the UFC with just a gable grip.

5078
02:02:01,790 --> 02:02:02,330
The guys,

5079
02:02:02,330 --> 02:02:03,163
the guy who,

5080
02:02:03,290 --> 02:02:04,430
the guy who was being choked.

5081
02:02:04,810 --> 02:02:05,031
Oh,

5082
02:02:05,031 --> 02:02:06,020
with the Gable grip works,

5083
02:02:06,390 --> 02:02:07,223
because I kind of grew,

5084
02:02:07,260 --> 02:02:08,093
I kind of grab your hand.

5085
02:02:08,100 --> 02:02:08,570
Hmm.

5086
02:02:08,570 --> 02:02:09,403
I see what you're saying.

5087
02:02:09,500 --> 02:02:11,390
Like if your hand is
here and I can grab it,

5088
02:02:11,810 --> 02:02:12,650
why would I choke?

5089
02:02:12,810 --> 02:02:13,700
Why would I,

5090
02:02:13,850 --> 02:02:14,660
why would I tap?

5091
02:02:14,660 --> 02:02:15,381
I can hold your hand.

5092
02:02:15,381 --> 02:02:16,214
I can grab onto it.

5093
02:02:16,220 --> 02:02:16,551
Right,

5094
02:02:16,551 --> 02:02:16,761
right,

5095
02:02:16,761 --> 02:02:17,594
right.

5096
02:02:18,110 --> 02:02:18,890
Yeah.

5097
02:02:18,890 --> 02:02:22,750
It's funny that in the early days
that was how everyone did a real nice,

5098
02:02:23,010 --> 02:02:24,080
it was more chronic.

5099
02:02:24,140 --> 02:02:24,740
It's more panic.

5100
02:02:24,740 --> 02:02:25,430
You okay,

5101
02:02:25,430 --> 02:02:28,100
oxygen is lower and you're topping,

5102
02:02:28,101 --> 02:02:29,060
but you're not going to go out.

5103
02:02:29,200 --> 02:02:30,710
People just didn't know any better.

5104
02:02:30,900 --> 02:02:31,480
Exactly.

5105
02:02:31,480 --> 02:02:32,570
That was okay to do.

5106
02:02:33,110 --> 02:02:33,361
Right.

5107
02:02:33,361 --> 02:02:35,660
It's not that that palm and the
back of the head was okay to do.

5108
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:37,760
I don't know who figured out to do this.

5109
02:02:37,900 --> 02:02:39,830
No problem behind the head is is okay.

5110
02:02:39,831 --> 02:02:40,664
I'm not against that.

5111
02:02:40,830 --> 02:02:43,430
It's when the hand is
top of the head bride,

5112
02:02:43,520 --> 02:02:44,750
it has to be unreachable.

5113
02:02:44,750 --> 02:02:45,501
If I can reach it,

5114
02:02:45,501 --> 02:02:46,010
I'm not tapping.

5115
02:02:46,010 --> 02:02:46,843
Right.

5116
02:02:46,940 --> 02:02:47,460
I'm not tired it.

5117
02:02:47,460 --> 02:02:47,991
I forget that.

5118
02:02:47,991 --> 02:02:48,824
Why would it happen?

5119
02:02:49,250 --> 02:02:49,630
It's,

5120
02:02:49,630 --> 02:02:50,650
it's an experience a few times.

5121
02:02:50,651 --> 02:02:50,991
It's like you,

5122
02:02:50,991 --> 02:02:51,824
you panicked a bit.

5123
02:02:52,430 --> 02:02:54,650
What's your feeling though on tapping?

5124
02:02:55,160 --> 02:02:57,470
Because here's the thing
about tapping like this.

5125
02:02:57,471 --> 02:02:59,060
I've had some injuries were like,

5126
02:02:59,061 --> 02:02:59,481
fuck,

5127
02:02:59,481 --> 02:03:04,481
I should have just tap and I got out of
it and I kept rolling and then my elbows

5128
02:03:04,700 --> 02:03:05,151
fucked.

5129
02:03:05,151 --> 02:03:06,840
I can't do chin ups
for a couple of months.

5130
02:03:06,850 --> 02:03:07,683
Top quick.

5131
02:03:08,360 --> 02:03:08,931
I don't have to,

5132
02:03:08,931 --> 02:03:11,840
strangle holds easily
except for gala things.

5133
02:03:11,841 --> 02:03:12,890
I feel like a torque my neck,

5134
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:13,971
but a rear naked,

5135
02:03:13,971 --> 02:03:15,800
there's no joint issue so I won't top,

5136
02:03:15,980 --> 02:03:17,150
I'm stubborn as the next guy.

5137
02:03:17,630 --> 02:03:20,020
My joints I top right away and I don't,

5138
02:03:20,021 --> 02:03:23,810
I don't put any miles on my joints
and I want to be as good as it can be,

5139
02:03:24,410 --> 02:03:25,710
as healthy as it can be.

5140
02:03:25,710 --> 02:03:26,840
It cause I want to roll till I'm,

5141
02:03:27,470 --> 02:03:27,741
you know,

5142
02:03:27,741 --> 02:03:28,820
like the week before I die.

5143
02:03:28,821 --> 02:03:29,930
I want to be rolling the week before.

5144
02:03:31,610 --> 02:03:35,840
Well that's the ultimate goal
that very few people ever achieve.

5145
02:03:36,050 --> 02:03:39,920
Every I know so many Jujitsu
guys that are so busted up.

5146
02:03:40,390 --> 02:03:44,030
Like Eddie Bravo has an
artificial disc in his lower back.

5147
02:03:44,390 --> 02:03:48,080
Both of his shoulders are completely
fucked and he's trying to avoid surgery in

5148
02:03:48,081 --> 02:03:48,710
his shoulders.

5149
02:03:48,710 --> 02:03:49,440
And he's knee too,

5150
02:03:49,440 --> 02:03:49,671
right?

5151
02:03:49,671 --> 02:03:51,530
Cause I was just with him in Vegas,

5152
02:03:52,010 --> 02:03:52,970
his ACL,

5153
02:03:52,971 --> 02:03:56,780
he had a tear in his ACL and then
he just got his knee operated on.

5154
02:03:56,781 --> 02:03:58,130
He had a bucket handle tear,

5155
02:03:58,131 --> 02:03:59,840
so he got his meniscus repaired.

5156
02:04:00,350 --> 02:04:00,801
But his,

5157
02:04:00,801 --> 02:04:00,980
uh,

5158
02:04:00,980 --> 02:04:02,180
his ACL was,

5159
02:04:02,181 --> 02:04:03,014
uh,

5160
02:04:03,180 --> 02:04:04,890
at least partially torn and he,

5161
02:04:04,940 --> 02:04:06,260
he's letting it heal.

5162
02:04:06,261 --> 02:04:10,640
But I'm very skeptical about people
that just let Parsha tail tears in

5163
02:04:10,641 --> 02:04:11,474
[inaudible] here.

5164
02:04:11,660 --> 02:04:12,261
Cause I feel like,

5165
02:04:12,261 --> 02:04:12,501
yeah,

5166
02:04:12,501 --> 02:04:13,191
you let it heal,

5167
02:04:13,191 --> 02:04:16,780
but it healed with like 60%
of its original strength.

5168
02:04:16,780 --> 02:04:18,680
Like you might have led and heal,

5169
02:04:18,681 --> 02:04:20,210
but how much did you
know there's a weakness?

5170
02:04:20,230 --> 02:04:20,960
Yeah.

5171
02:04:20,960 --> 02:04:21,830
You know what they're doing now,

5172
02:04:21,831 --> 02:04:22,760
which is really fascinating.

5173
02:04:22,761 --> 02:04:25,160
Dr Roddy Mcgee out of Las Vegas,

5174
02:04:25,161 --> 02:04:27,140
who does a lot of work with UFC fighters,

5175
02:04:27,410 --> 02:04:32,270
he's showing me that they're taking torn
ACL is completely torn and instead of

5176
02:04:32,271 --> 02:04:35,450
replacing it now with a cadaver
graft or Patella tendon graft,

5177
02:04:35,690 --> 02:04:38,310
they actually take that
ligament and can reattach it.

5178
02:04:38,550 --> 02:04:39,030
Really.

5179
02:04:39,030 --> 02:04:42,360
And in three months they had
someone competing in the Olympics.

5180
02:04:42,510 --> 02:04:43,050
Really?

5181
02:04:43,050 --> 02:04:43,680
Yes.

5182
02:04:43,680 --> 02:04:44,630
What's his name?

5183
02:04:44,940 --> 02:04:46,080
Doctor Rati Magee.

5184
02:04:46,320 --> 02:04:46,950
Wow.

5185
02:04:46,950 --> 02:04:47,221
Yeah.

5186
02:04:47,221 --> 02:04:48,010
Cutting edge.

5187
02:04:48,010 --> 02:04:49,430
Ms here in the u s Yup.

5188
02:04:49,580 --> 02:04:50,550
Widest and greatest.

5189
02:04:50,640 --> 02:04:51,540
And they're doing it.

5190
02:04:51,541 --> 02:04:53,340
It's a crazy operation.

5191
02:04:53,550 --> 02:04:56,700
They're taking this broken ligament
and they obviously have to do it quick

5192
02:04:56,701 --> 02:04:59,250
before it pulls back and disintegrates.

5193
02:04:59,580 --> 02:05:01,740
But when it gets to the,

5194
02:05:01,741 --> 02:05:02,730
they get the torrent,

5195
02:05:02,820 --> 02:05:03,653
the tear in it,

5196
02:05:03,750 --> 02:05:05,180
they reattach it and they,

5197
02:05:05,190 --> 02:05:06,600
so the shit out of this thing,

5198
02:05:06,750 --> 02:05:10,050
they've got like stitches in it
and it's all weirdly bound up.

5199
02:05:10,230 --> 02:05:15,230
And then it reattaches if reattaches and
actually grows your original ligament

5200
02:05:15,781 --> 02:05:16,410
as well.

5201
02:05:16,410 --> 02:05:17,040
It's not,

5202
02:05:17,040 --> 02:05:17,873
you know,

5203
02:05:18,130 --> 02:05:20,400
that your body can reject
or something that you're,

5204
02:05:20,401 --> 02:05:21,000
you know,

5205
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,310
you don't have to compromise
your patella tendon,

5206
02:05:23,340 --> 02:05:23,701
you know,

5207
02:05:23,701 --> 02:05:25,230
I don't know how George had his done.

5208
02:05:25,530 --> 02:05:27,150
Did he do the Patella tendon graft?

5209
02:05:27,180 --> 02:05:29,090
I feel like you did with one of them.

5210
02:05:29,420 --> 02:05:30,840
[inaudible] they don't have a string of,

5211
02:05:30,841 --> 02:05:31,674
can't remember.

5212
02:05:31,740 --> 02:05:32,131
He didn't,

5213
02:05:32,131 --> 02:05:33,030
he didn't take ever,

5214
02:05:33,300 --> 02:05:35,340
he took his own to do it both ways.

5215
02:05:35,680 --> 02:05:37,110
Both Times the same way?

5216
02:05:37,530 --> 02:05:37,981
I think so.

5217
02:05:37,981 --> 02:05:38,220
Yeah.

5218
02:05:38,220 --> 02:05:38,820
I think so.

5219
02:05:38,820 --> 02:05:39,300
Yeah.

5220
02:05:39,300 --> 02:05:40,133
If I remember correct,

5221
02:05:40,620 --> 02:05:41,210
Matt,

5222
02:05:41,210 --> 02:05:41,520
uh,

5223
02:05:41,520 --> 02:05:44,130
Matt Brown just did a hamstring.

5224
02:05:44,220 --> 02:05:47,230
He just had his done and they
did a hamstring and he said it's,

5225
02:05:47,580 --> 02:05:48,780
he feels pretty good already.

5226
02:05:48,920 --> 02:05:49,650
Yeah.

5227
02:05:49,650 --> 02:05:50,483
You know,

5228
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:51,160
it's,

5229
02:05:51,160 --> 02:05:51,993
it's scary injury.

5230
02:05:52,080 --> 02:05:52,710
Oh,

5231
02:05:52,710 --> 02:05:53,543
I've had bolt on.

5232
02:05:53,580 --> 02:05:53,971
Really?

5233
02:05:53,971 --> 02:05:54,220
Yeah.

5234
02:05:54,220 --> 02:05:57,570
I've had a one with a patella
tendon graft and one with a cadaver.

5235
02:05:57,660 --> 02:05:59,130
The cadaver was much easier for me.

5236
02:05:59,150 --> 02:05:59,610
Really?

5237
02:05:59,610 --> 02:06:00,180
Yeah.

5238
02:06:00,180 --> 02:06:01,013
It took,

5239
02:06:01,260 --> 02:06:02,010
yeah.

5240
02:06:02,010 --> 02:06:04,350
I don't see the thing about it taking,

5241
02:06:04,351 --> 02:06:05,700
you're not taking the idea.

5242
02:06:05,740 --> 02:06:08,250
What happens with the cadaver
is people think that you're,

5243
02:06:08,280 --> 02:06:10,650
your body takes it like
an artificial heart.

5244
02:06:11,220 --> 02:06:11,671
No.

5245
02:06:11,671 --> 02:06:12,240
Or like a,

5246
02:06:12,240 --> 02:06:12,521
you know,

5247
02:06:12,521 --> 02:06:13,530
a transplanted heart.

5248
02:06:13,560 --> 02:06:18,450
It actually uses it as a scaffolding
to re proliferate with your own cells.

5249
02:06:19,200 --> 02:06:23,700
And I think part of the problem is it
gives you the feeling that it's stronger

5250
02:06:23,701 --> 02:06:25,410
than it is early on you're like,

5251
02:06:25,411 --> 02:06:25,900
yeah,

5252
02:06:25,900 --> 02:06:26,731
I'm ready to go.

5253
02:06:26,731 --> 02:06:27,301
I'm ready to go.

5254
02:06:27,301 --> 02:06:28,080
And you start,

5255
02:06:28,080 --> 02:06:30,150
you mean everybody wants
to start rolling again?

5256
02:06:30,151 --> 02:06:31,500
Everybody wants to start training again.

5257
02:06:31,740 --> 02:06:35,460
And so I think some guys just get in
there a little bit too early and they do

5258
02:06:35,461 --> 02:06:37,410
something and it pops and they go,

5259
02:06:37,411 --> 02:06:37,591
oh,

5260
02:06:37,591 --> 02:06:39,120
it didn't take well.

5261
02:06:39,121 --> 02:06:44,070
Is that really the case or did you just
put too much stress on it too early on?

5262
02:06:44,160 --> 02:06:46,860
I thought the fear was
it can reject your body,

5263
02:06:46,861 --> 02:06:47,694
can reject it.

5264
02:06:47,820 --> 02:06:48,690
I've heard of that,

5265
02:06:48,691 --> 02:06:50,220
but I think that's extremely rare.

5266
02:06:50,240 --> 02:06:50,550
Okay.

5267
02:06:50,550 --> 02:06:51,390
I think what,

5268
02:06:51,450 --> 02:06:56,450
what's more common is that they say
it doesn't take like that it didn't,

5269
02:06:57,091 --> 02:07:00,000
but I think what I hear it from MMA guys,

5270
02:07:00,030 --> 02:07:00,331
it's like,

5271
02:07:00,331 --> 02:07:02,070
I know you are a meathead.

5272
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:04,050
I know you guys are savages.

5273
02:07:04,051 --> 02:07:08,310
You get in there and you're training
hard way earlier than you should be and

5274
02:07:08,311 --> 02:07:09,480
then it fucks up again.

5275
02:07:09,510 --> 02:07:09,850
I mean,

5276
02:07:09,850 --> 02:07:13,830
there's a bunch of guys that have got
an ACL surgery and then in the recovery

5277
02:07:13,831 --> 02:07:15,150
process blew it out again.

5278
02:07:15,300 --> 02:07:18,450
It happens really common and then
they're back to square one again.

5279
02:07:18,750 --> 02:07:19,583
Right?

5280
02:07:19,710 --> 02:07:20,521
It's all narratives.

5281
02:07:20,521 --> 02:07:20,701
I mean,

5282
02:07:20,701 --> 02:07:21,031
even the,

5283
02:07:21,031 --> 02:07:21,690
even the,

5284
02:07:21,690 --> 02:07:22,261
I mean to,

5285
02:07:22,261 --> 02:07:23,340
to explain something,

5286
02:07:23,341 --> 02:07:23,970
it's,

5287
02:07:23,970 --> 02:07:24,930
it's really just,

5288
02:07:25,470 --> 02:07:26,110
it's narrative.

5289
02:07:26,110 --> 02:07:28,920
That's what our explanations
are 99% of the time.

5290
02:07:28,921 --> 02:07:31,530
Just narratives and then to weed
out narratives and not use them.

5291
02:07:31,531 --> 02:07:32,364
It's very difficult.

5292
02:07:32,400 --> 02:07:33,170
What household,

5293
02:07:33,170 --> 02:07:34,003
what do you mean by that?

5294
02:07:34,190 --> 02:07:34,860
Um,

5295
02:07:34,860 --> 02:07:36,310
I mean there are differences between

5296
02:07:36,580 --> 02:07:37,690
logical arguments,

5297
02:07:38,230 --> 02:07:39,400
empirical observations,

5298
02:07:39,430 --> 02:07:40,450
and then there are narratives.

5299
02:07:40,990 --> 02:07:44,050
We tell ourselves why things are
happening around this all the time.

5300
02:07:44,051 --> 02:07:45,820
And it's 99% of the time it's wrong.

5301
02:07:45,850 --> 02:07:46,683
But we believe it.

5302
02:07:46,870 --> 02:07:47,710
We tell ourselves that.

5303
02:07:47,711 --> 02:07:49,010
And to try to work around that is,

5304
02:07:49,011 --> 02:07:49,990
is actually quite difficult.

5305
02:07:50,650 --> 02:07:51,490
So like for instance,

5306
02:07:51,491 --> 02:07:52,120
uh,

5307
02:07:52,120 --> 02:07:52,300
when,

5308
02:07:52,300 --> 02:07:54,550
when the field of philosophy
and if you give an argument,

5309
02:07:55,180 --> 02:07:56,560
if you give a deductive argument,

5310
02:07:56,740 --> 02:08:00,010
your argument has to conclude
the conclusion has to
have no other possibility.

5311
02:08:00,230 --> 02:08:01,570
It can be no other possibility.

5312
02:08:01,571 --> 02:08:05,680
All your premises have to be valid
and sound and there can be no other

5313
02:08:05,681 --> 02:08:06,281
possibility.

5314
02:08:06,281 --> 02:08:07,114
When I say,

5315
02:08:07,210 --> 02:08:07,421
Hey,

5316
02:08:07,421 --> 02:08:08,530
my ligament didn't take,

5317
02:08:09,400 --> 02:08:10,233
there's a thought.

5318
02:08:10,420 --> 02:08:11,320
That's an explanation.

5319
02:08:12,370 --> 02:08:15,280
It's one of many possible narratives.

5320
02:08:16,450 --> 02:08:17,283
It's one of,

5321
02:08:17,590 --> 02:08:18,640
it's one of many,

5322
02:08:18,641 --> 02:08:20,500
many possible explanations
I couldn't give.

5323
02:08:20,501 --> 02:08:21,070
Why might,

5324
02:08:21,070 --> 02:08:23,800
why my knee's injured now
including that you didn't give it,

5325
02:08:23,801 --> 02:08:24,940
let it rest enough.

5326
02:08:24,990 --> 02:08:25,823
Right?

5327
02:08:26,530 --> 02:08:30,310
Let's say I'm walking and I trip over my
shoelaces and maybe like I tripped over

5328
02:08:30,311 --> 02:08:31,144
my shoelaces.

5329
02:08:31,210 --> 02:08:32,043
That's why I felt,

5330
02:08:32,860 --> 02:08:33,161
well,

5331
02:08:33,161 --> 02:08:34,900
you could made if your
shoelaces were untied,

5332
02:08:34,901 --> 02:08:36,040
maybe trip anyway.

5333
02:08:36,041 --> 02:08:37,090
Maybe it was something else,

5334
02:08:37,091 --> 02:08:37,300
right?

5335
02:08:37,300 --> 02:08:37,750
You haven't,

5336
02:08:37,750 --> 02:08:40,660
you haven't eliminated every
other possibility if you
haven't eliminated every

5337
02:08:40,661 --> 02:08:41,560
other possibility.

5338
02:08:41,920 --> 02:08:42,940
It's just a narrative.

5339
02:08:43,570 --> 02:08:44,650
It's not actual fact.

5340
02:08:45,220 --> 02:08:49,340
The Tony Ferguson injury was the
most fucked up one I've ever,

5341
02:08:49,480 --> 02:08:51,850
ever right the week of the fight,

5342
02:08:52,310 --> 02:08:56,350
press trips on some cables
and rips his knee apart.

5343
02:08:56,680 --> 02:08:57,071
For sure.

5344
02:08:57,071 --> 02:08:58,090
He had an injury before.

5345
02:08:58,091 --> 02:08:59,440
He is not aware of you think so.

5346
02:08:59,860 --> 02:09:03,460
There had to be a small rip,

5347
02:09:03,490 --> 02:09:04,301
a small tear,

5348
02:09:04,301 --> 02:09:06,070
a small weakness somewhere.

5349
02:09:06,720 --> 02:09:07,553
Ain't no way he can win.

5350
02:09:07,670 --> 02:09:08,920
He could withstand shipping on a,

5351
02:09:09,130 --> 02:09:09,581
on a,

5352
02:09:09,581 --> 02:09:10,240
on a cable,

5353
02:09:10,240 --> 02:09:11,890
but I mean it was hanging by a thread.

5354
02:09:11,920 --> 02:09:13,330
Is that the case or did it,

5355
02:09:13,900 --> 02:09:16,600
did he just followed a
really fucked up man?

5356
02:09:16,630 --> 02:09:17,560
I didn't see the fall,

5357
02:09:18,100 --> 02:09:22,990
but I assume he's a athletic guy and
you could fall in a way he can catch

5358
02:09:22,991 --> 02:09:24,340
himself falling in a way that,

5359
02:09:24,760 --> 02:09:25,061
you know,

5360
02:09:25,061 --> 02:09:26,410
is his athletic.

5361
02:09:26,830 --> 02:09:27,820
He may be,

5362
02:09:27,830 --> 02:09:28,240
he had,

5363
02:09:28,240 --> 02:09:28,601
you know,

5364
02:09:28,601 --> 02:09:29,434
when you're sparring,

5365
02:09:29,440 --> 02:09:30,191
you hurt yourself.

5366
02:09:30,191 --> 02:09:32,230
You don't feel it so much is going on.

5367
02:09:32,231 --> 02:09:34,720
Maybe he hurt himself when he
cooled down and he didn't feel it.

5368
02:09:34,721 --> 02:09:35,020
It's not,

5369
02:09:35,020 --> 02:09:36,820
there's not many pain
sensors there or whatnot.

5370
02:09:37,060 --> 02:09:37,330
Again,

5371
02:09:37,330 --> 02:09:38,163
this is just a narrative,

5372
02:09:38,220 --> 02:09:38,531
right?

5373
02:09:38,531 --> 02:09:39,160
Then he goes in there,

5374
02:09:39,160 --> 02:09:40,000
it's hanging by a thread.

5375
02:09:40,001 --> 02:09:40,810
He tugs it,

5376
02:09:40,810 --> 02:09:41,110
boom.

5377
02:09:41,110 --> 02:09:41,980
The whole thing breaks apart,

5378
02:09:41,981 --> 02:09:42,790
you know,

5379
02:09:42,790 --> 02:09:43,540
it's,

5380
02:09:43,540 --> 02:09:43,691
well,

5381
02:09:43,691 --> 02:09:44,500
it's a possibility.

5382
02:09:44,500 --> 02:09:46,330
It's such a violent injury.

5383
02:09:46,331 --> 02:09:47,620
If you see how bad it was.

5384
02:09:47,890 --> 02:09:49,310
Did you see the surgery photos?

5385
02:09:49,420 --> 02:09:49,871
I saw,

5386
02:09:49,871 --> 02:09:52,100
I saw actually a little bit the
craziest photos I've ever seen.

5387
02:09:52,101 --> 02:09:52,480
I mean his,

5388
02:09:52,480 --> 02:09:57,480
it's a fucking enormous scar to have
that kind of a scar in 2018 while the

5389
02:09:57,601 --> 02:09:59,110
surgery techniques they have today.

5390
02:09:59,560 --> 02:10:02,050
It's very rare that you
see someone who's just,

5391
02:10:02,051 --> 02:10:02,830
I mean it's,

5392
02:10:02,830 --> 02:10:05,170
you're looking at like
a 12 inch scar really?

5393
02:10:05,230 --> 02:10:05,741
That I didn't see,

5394
02:10:05,741 --> 02:10:06,231
I just saw him.

5395
02:10:06,231 --> 02:10:07,600
He posted an Oh my God.

5396
02:10:08,230 --> 02:10:08,770
Wow.

5397
02:10:08,770 --> 02:10:09,670
That's huge.

5398
02:10:09,820 --> 02:10:10,301
It's credible.

5399
02:10:10,301 --> 02:10:10,780
I mean that,

5400
02:10:10,780 --> 02:10:15,780
that is a giant scar goes well below his
knee to above the knee and they opened

5401
02:10:17,231 --> 02:10:17,651
him up.

5402
02:10:17,651 --> 02:10:18,760
And what does this,

5403
02:10:18,790 --> 02:10:20,770
is this pre surgery?

5404
02:10:20,830 --> 02:10:21,360
What does that,

5405
02:10:21,360 --> 02:10:23,530
so this is just different angles at ACL.

5406
02:10:23,531 --> 02:10:23,921
What was it?

5407
02:10:23,921 --> 02:10:24,630
No,

5408
02:10:24,630 --> 02:10:26,050
his MCL.

5409
02:10:26,840 --> 02:10:27,810
A PCL out.

5410
02:10:27,811 --> 02:10:29,530
Which one is on the outside?

5411
02:10:29,680 --> 02:10:30,700
Outside is MCL.

5412
02:10:30,880 --> 02:10:32,350
So as MCL was ripped,

5413
02:10:32,351 --> 02:10:34,280
completely bone.

5414
02:10:34,910 --> 02:10:35,743
Wow.

5415
02:10:36,290 --> 02:10:37,123
Yeah,

5416
02:10:37,340 --> 02:10:38,000
man.

5417
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:38,790
What Gilda?

5418
02:10:38,790 --> 02:10:40,790
His Twitter is Instagram page.

5419
02:10:40,791 --> 02:10:42,680
Now does he have,

5420
02:10:42,681 --> 02:10:43,514
um,

5421
02:10:43,620 --> 02:10:46,850
and the updates because a guy like that,

5422
02:10:46,851 --> 02:10:47,930
you gotta wonder like,

5423
02:10:47,931 --> 02:10:51,920
when is he going photo I saw the
one with the Suction Cup is copping.

5424
02:10:52,020 --> 02:10:53,030
Is that okay?

5425
02:10:53,090 --> 02:10:53,923
Let me ask you this.

5426
02:10:54,140 --> 02:10:56,780
Cause I was just having a conversation
with someone who was it that just say a

5427
02:10:56,781 --> 02:10:57,650
cup and was bullshit.

5428
02:10:57,680 --> 02:10:58,513
It was a,

5429
02:10:59,140 --> 02:11:00,140
was it,

5430
02:11:00,950 --> 02:11:02,330
I was having a conversation with someone.

5431
02:11:02,331 --> 02:11:05,900
They're saying cupping is
essentially almost total nonsense,

5432
02:11:05,901 --> 02:11:10,190
but so many people do it and it just puts
your mind that you're doing something

5433
02:11:10,191 --> 02:11:11,990
and healing and doing something,

5434
02:11:12,740 --> 02:11:13,071
you know,

5435
02:11:13,071 --> 02:11:18,071
addition in addition to
standard procedures to that
that's helping you out but

5436
02:11:18,330 --> 02:11:19,310
really ain't doing shit.

5437
02:11:20,060 --> 02:11:20,893
Um,

5438
02:11:21,260 --> 02:11:21,601
I would say,

5439
02:11:21,601 --> 02:11:21,691
yeah,

5440
02:11:21,691 --> 02:11:23,000
it's probably more psychological,

5441
02:11:23,990 --> 02:11:25,070
but everybody does it.

5442
02:11:25,330 --> 02:11:25,580
Yeah,

5443
02:11:25,580 --> 02:11:26,031
it's fun.

5444
02:11:26,031 --> 02:11:26,781
It's like a logical,

5445
02:11:26,781 --> 02:11:29,150
you feel like you're taking care of
yourself and it makes you feel good.

5446
02:11:29,150 --> 02:11:29,990
It's psychosomatic.

5447
02:11:30,050 --> 02:11:31,880
It's funny because back up,

5448
02:11:32,090 --> 02:11:32,540
hold on,

5449
02:11:32,540 --> 02:11:33,830
go back up to that image of Jamie.

5450
02:11:34,450 --> 02:11:34,720
I mean,

5451
02:11:34,720 --> 02:11:35,230
look,

5452
02:11:35,230 --> 02:11:36,063
look at that.

5453
02:11:36,170 --> 02:11:37,850
That is fucking crazy looking.

5454
02:11:38,360 --> 02:11:39,193
It is.

5455
02:11:39,470 --> 02:11:40,303
Yeah.

5456
02:11:40,760 --> 02:11:41,031
Yeah.

5457
02:11:41,031 --> 02:11:41,511
But you know,

5458
02:11:41,511 --> 02:11:44,360
psychosomatic medicine can help you.

5459
02:11:44,660 --> 02:11:45,190
But hearsay,

5460
02:11:45,190 --> 02:11:48,170
an insurance covers acupuncture
treatment because it's effective.

5461
02:11:48,171 --> 02:11:50,550
I was skeptical the first time I tried it,

5462
02:11:50,870 --> 02:11:51,460
but it,

5463
02:11:51,460 --> 02:11:51,830
yeah.

5464
02:11:51,830 --> 02:11:52,101
See,

5465
02:11:52,101 --> 02:11:52,934
I don't know.

5466
02:11:53,490 --> 02:11:54,860
You are a complete moron then.

5467
02:11:54,980 --> 02:11:56,720
Even insurance covers acupuncture.

5468
02:11:58,010 --> 02:11:58,843
Well,

5469
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,070
does acupuncture work?

5470
02:12:01,390 --> 02:12:02,223
I have no idea.

5471
02:12:02,720 --> 02:12:03,261
Never tested.

5472
02:12:03,261 --> 02:12:04,094
Never fucked with it.

5473
02:12:04,220 --> 02:12:05,180
I've had it done to me.

5474
02:12:05,181 --> 02:12:06,500
I didn't particularly enjoyed it.

5475
02:12:06,740 --> 02:12:07,340
Yeah.

5476
02:12:07,340 --> 02:12:09,680
I only had it done once and
the guy was kind of acquired.

5477
02:12:09,800 --> 02:12:10,490
Yeah.

5478
02:12:10,490 --> 02:12:11,090
And I was like,

5479
02:12:11,090 --> 02:12:11,923
all right.

5480
02:12:11,930 --> 02:12:12,280
He didn't,

5481
02:12:12,280 --> 02:12:13,970
once they start talking about toxins,

5482
02:12:14,440 --> 02:12:14,870
you know,

5483
02:12:14,870 --> 02:12:16,310
we're cleansing you toxins.

5484
02:12:16,340 --> 02:12:16,640
Like,

5485
02:12:16,640 --> 02:12:17,241
oh,

5486
02:12:17,241 --> 02:12:18,074
that's a narrative.

5487
02:12:18,080 --> 02:12:18,470
Yeah.

5488
02:12:18,470 --> 02:12:19,303
Possible.

5489
02:12:19,430 --> 02:12:20,263
Let's not prove it.

5490
02:12:20,390 --> 02:12:20,741
Right.

5491
02:12:20,741 --> 02:12:22,280
It's a possible story you told yourself.

5492
02:12:22,310 --> 02:12:22,791
Yeah.

5493
02:12:22,791 --> 02:12:27,260
But that term toxins is
so that that is like,

5494
02:12:27,680 --> 02:12:29,420
there's certain things that people say,

5495
02:12:29,421 --> 02:12:29,571
well,

5496
02:12:29,571 --> 02:12:30,201
you know,

5497
02:12:30,201 --> 02:12:31,470
you're dealing with a woo,

5498
02:12:31,720 --> 02:12:31,940
oh,

5499
02:12:31,940 --> 02:12:33,830
this is some bullshit here.

5500
02:12:33,860 --> 02:12:35,180
And toxins is one of them.

5501
02:12:35,181 --> 02:12:36,920
Cleansing and toxins.

5502
02:12:36,921 --> 02:12:39,130
I'm going into a class and I'm,

5503
02:12:39,680 --> 02:12:41,840
I'm getting the toxins out of my system.

5504
02:12:41,870 --> 02:12:45,800
The scientists are just as guilty
as of Wu is every other guy.

5505
02:12:45,860 --> 02:12:46,330
You think so?

5506
02:12:46,330 --> 02:12:47,163
Oh yeah.

5507
02:12:47,480 --> 02:12:48,140
In what way?

5508
02:12:48,140 --> 02:12:48,951
Oh my God,

5509
02:12:48,951 --> 02:12:49,250
man.

5510
02:12:49,250 --> 02:12:49,981
Like there's,

5511
02:12:49,981 --> 02:12:50,721
there's scientists,

5512
02:12:50,721 --> 02:12:52,280
then there's philosophers of science.

5513
02:12:53,540 --> 02:12:55,580
There's so much Wu in science,

5514
02:12:55,581 --> 02:12:57,500
even the most popular guys have woo.

5515
02:12:57,530 --> 02:12:59,480
They just never studied
the philosophy of science.

5516
02:12:59,481 --> 02:13:01,490
So they don't really understand
what they're saying per say.

5517
02:13:01,670 --> 02:13:01,851
Like,

5518
02:13:01,851 --> 02:13:03,140
give me an example of wounds.

5519
02:13:03,160 --> 02:13:03,680
I'll give you,

5520
02:13:03,680 --> 02:13:04,161
I'll give you a great,

5521
02:13:04,161 --> 02:13:04,820
he's okay.

5522
02:13:04,820 --> 02:13:05,653
Okay.

5523
02:13:05,720 --> 02:13:06,553
Um,

5524
02:13:07,280 --> 02:13:08,510
there's this guy named Isaac Newton.

5525
02:13:08,780 --> 02:13:09,430
Okay,

5526
02:13:09,430 --> 02:13:10,220
I heard of that dude.

5527
02:13:10,220 --> 02:13:10,401
Yeah.

5528
02:13:10,401 --> 02:13:11,121
And you're asking him,

5529
02:13:11,121 --> 02:13:11,750
Hey Isaac,

5530
02:13:11,750 --> 02:13:13,430
why don't I fall off
the face of the earth?

5531
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:14,541
And he's going to be like,

5532
02:13:14,541 --> 02:13:14,721
well,

5533
02:13:14,721 --> 02:13:15,554
Joe,

5534
02:13:15,950 --> 02:13:16,850
there's this gravity.

5535
02:13:16,851 --> 02:13:19,040
This is the force of gravity
pulling you down to the earth.

5536
02:13:19,340 --> 02:13:20,690
The earth has a greater mass than you.

5537
02:13:20,691 --> 02:13:21,350
Therefore it's,

5538
02:13:21,350 --> 02:13:22,970
there's this force pulling you down.

5539
02:13:22,971 --> 02:13:23,804
We call it gravity.

5540
02:13:24,860 --> 02:13:25,850
And then some guy comes around,

5541
02:13:25,851 --> 02:13:26,101
his name is,

5542
02:13:26,101 --> 02:13:26,541
is a hobby.

5543
02:13:26,541 --> 02:13:26,841
And he tells,

5544
02:13:26,841 --> 02:13:27,171
you know,

5545
02:13:27,171 --> 02:13:27,371
Joel,

5546
02:13:27,371 --> 02:13:28,204
don't listen to that guy.

5547
02:13:29,270 --> 02:13:30,110
I have another theory.

5548
02:13:30,111 --> 02:13:32,030
Way more that's

5549
02:13:32,100 --> 02:13:32,933
shorter than his.

5550
02:13:33,960 --> 02:13:36,090
I believe there are gremlins
pulling it down to the earth.

5551
02:13:36,600 --> 02:13:37,351
They have last holes.

5552
02:13:37,351 --> 02:13:37,941
He's infinite.

5553
02:13:37,941 --> 02:13:38,611
Long last was,

5554
02:13:38,611 --> 02:13:39,600
and every time you're falling off the,

5555
02:13:39,601 --> 02:13:40,231
if they pull you,

5556
02:13:40,231 --> 02:13:41,820
every time you jump up
and down on the earth,

5557
02:13:42,300 --> 02:13:43,620
they pull you back down to the earth.

5558
02:13:43,621 --> 02:13:45,090
You don't see these
gremlins are invisible,

5559
02:13:45,091 --> 02:13:46,560
but that's what's pulling
you down to the earth.

5560
02:13:47,700 --> 02:13:47,881
Now,

5561
02:13:47,881 --> 02:13:49,230
how do you know who's
right and who's wrong?

5562
02:13:49,830 --> 02:13:50,880
Who's telling you the truth?

5563
02:13:50,881 --> 02:13:51,714
Mere Isaac.

5564
02:13:52,170 --> 02:13:53,003
Well,

5565
02:13:53,100 --> 02:13:57,780
Isaac lived a long time ago before they
actually had provable studies that could

5566
02:13:57,781 --> 02:14:00,030
show you why gravity works.

5567
02:14:00,060 --> 02:14:01,230
Naming one of those studies.

5568
02:14:01,260 --> 02:14:01,381
Well,

5569
02:14:01,381 --> 02:14:02,460
I'm not a scientist.

5570
02:14:02,461 --> 02:14:02,671
Well,

5571
02:14:02,671 --> 02:14:03,110
No side.

5572
02:14:03,110 --> 02:14:03,390
Let me,

5573
02:14:03,390 --> 02:14:04,350
let me break it to you this way.

5574
02:14:04,620 --> 02:14:07,590
No scientist has a study to
prove us that gravity works.

5575
02:14:07,610 --> 02:14:07,870
That's,

5576
02:14:07,870 --> 02:14:08,641
that's the whole thing.

5577
02:14:08,641 --> 02:14:08,831
That's,

5578
02:14:08,831 --> 02:14:09,930
that's what's scary about.

5579
02:14:10,230 --> 02:14:14,400
But can you talk about the universal and
understand that gravity is in relation

5580
02:14:14,401 --> 02:14:16,500
to the size and mass of objects.

5581
02:14:16,500 --> 02:14:18,000
So the moon is smaller,

5582
02:14:18,001 --> 02:14:21,420
therefore it has one six earth's gravity
cause it's one quarter the size of the

5583
02:14:21,421 --> 02:14:21,810
earth.

5584
02:14:21,810 --> 02:14:23,790
There's a standard
formula that you follow.

5585
02:14:23,820 --> 02:14:24,653
There's a correlation.

5586
02:14:25,230 --> 02:14:25,770
Now My,

5587
02:14:25,770 --> 02:14:26,940
my theory of Gremlins,

5588
02:14:26,941 --> 02:14:28,430
which obviously I don't believe in,

5589
02:14:28,431 --> 02:14:28,591
right?

5590
02:14:28,591 --> 02:14:31,380
I'm using the theological language
to make it really sip though.

5591
02:14:31,381 --> 02:14:33,080
Somebody misquote me that
I've even really know

5592
02:14:35,400 --> 02:14:37,560
he doesn't believe in
gravity is gravity denier.

5593
02:14:37,800 --> 02:14:38,633
Exactly.

5594
02:14:38,820 --> 02:14:39,653
Well,

5595
02:14:39,900 --> 02:14:40,320
I have,

5596
02:14:40,320 --> 02:14:40,830
there's less.

5597
02:14:40,830 --> 02:14:41,663
There's less mass.

5598
02:14:41,790 --> 02:14:42,630
There's less Adams.

5599
02:14:42,930 --> 02:14:43,970
The moon has less Adams.

5600
02:14:43,980 --> 02:14:44,850
Therefore less Gremlin.

5601
02:14:44,880 --> 02:14:45,470
Lesser than pulling.

5602
02:14:45,470 --> 02:14:46,570
You might.

5603
02:14:46,620 --> 02:14:50,130
My gremlin theory correlates
with the gravity theory.

5604
02:14:50,190 --> 02:14:51,023
Exactly,

5605
02:14:51,480 --> 02:14:52,380
but I'm using a myth,

5606
02:14:52,400 --> 02:14:53,161
mythical language.

5607
02:14:53,161 --> 02:14:58,161
Just to point out that every type of
force we're talking about is an inference.

5608
02:14:58,920 --> 02:15:00,240
It's something we project out there.

5609
02:15:00,241 --> 02:15:02,880
We don't actually see gravity
and you know later on,

5610
02:15:02,881 --> 02:15:04,020
Einstein debunked gravity,

5611
02:15:04,021 --> 02:15:04,780
right?

5612
02:15:04,780 --> 02:15:05,070
When?

5613
02:15:05,070 --> 02:15:06,910
What do you mean by he dunk gravity?

5614
02:15:07,080 --> 02:15:08,010
Isaac was totally wrong.

5615
02:15:08,600 --> 02:15:11,610
I think explanation of why you don't
fall off the earth was totally wrong.

5616
02:15:12,600 --> 02:15:12,960
Well,

5617
02:15:12,960 --> 02:15:14,790
what did Einstein due to debunk it?

5618
02:15:15,390 --> 02:15:20,390
Einstein taught us that a new theory and
new hypothesis that gravity's a pushing

5619
02:15:20,581 --> 02:15:20,851
force,

5620
02:15:20,851 --> 02:15:21,840
not a pulling force.

5621
02:15:22,050 --> 02:15:24,540
See Isaac Newton,

5622
02:15:25,260 --> 02:15:26,340
he debunked Aristotle

5623
02:15:28,980 --> 02:15:29,251
first.

5624
02:15:29,251 --> 02:15:30,630
We to believe what Aristotle used to say.

5625
02:15:30,631 --> 02:15:31,321
I was starting to say,

5626
02:15:31,321 --> 02:15:31,980
look,

5627
02:15:31,980 --> 02:15:35,910
this thing has a natural place.

5628
02:15:35,940 --> 02:15:36,990
It has to be stuck to the earth.

5629
02:15:36,991 --> 02:15:39,780
That's just natural place it the
forces within that one thing.

5630
02:15:40,650 --> 02:15:41,720
That's why it doesn't fall off theorists.

5631
02:15:41,770 --> 02:15:43,890
So when Aristotle saw bird fly,

5632
02:15:44,340 --> 02:15:44,761
he said it,

5633
02:15:44,761 --> 02:15:44,911
look,

5634
02:15:44,911 --> 02:15:45,744
it has levity.

5635
02:15:46,530 --> 02:15:48,000
It's natural state is to be in the air.

5636
02:15:48,030 --> 02:15:49,980
The force that carries it up in the air,

5637
02:15:49,981 --> 02:15:50,814
it's within it.

5638
02:15:50,980 --> 02:15:52,470
Within the bird itself.

5639
02:15:53,460 --> 02:15:54,540
Isaac Newton came around and said,

5640
02:15:54,541 --> 02:15:54,691
no,

5641
02:15:54,691 --> 02:15:55,524
that's totally wrong.

5642
02:15:56,100 --> 02:15:56,611
Nobody,

5643
02:15:56,611 --> 02:15:57,000
no,

5644
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:58,770
no entity can move itself.

5645
02:15:59,910 --> 02:16:01,170
It's only a force that's applied.

5646
02:16:01,200 --> 02:16:04,080
So let's say you're walking Isaac Newton
would say you're not pushing yourself

5647
02:16:04,081 --> 02:16:04,860
forward.

5648
02:16:04,860 --> 02:16:08,220
You're pushing the ground
beneath you backwards

5649
02:16:09,990 --> 02:16:14,430
and that the ground is pushing you
forwards so that every action has an

5650
02:16:14,431 --> 02:16:14,670
opposite,

5651
02:16:14,670 --> 02:16:15,503
equal reaction.

5652
02:16:16,050 --> 02:16:16,801
So when I run,

5653
02:16:16,801 --> 02:16:18,180
I'm really pushing the ground behind me.

5654
02:16:18,181 --> 02:16:19,014
It sounds like,

5655
02:16:19,290 --> 02:16:20,160
like he's splitting hairs,

5656
02:16:20,161 --> 02:16:21,600
but he's saying something
actually very profound.

5657
02:16:22,020 --> 02:16:22,411
He saying,

5658
02:16:22,411 --> 02:16:25,410
you're pushing the earth behind you
and the earth is pushing you forward.

5659
02:16:25,470 --> 02:16:26,310
There's a reaction there.

5660
02:16:26,311 --> 02:16:27,141
So what they do to,

5661
02:16:27,141 --> 02:16:29,920
to illustrate that to kids is
they take like a train track,

5662
02:16:29,921 --> 02:16:31,570
the elevated and the turn on the train,

5663
02:16:31,810 --> 02:16:34,990
and then you see the train tracks
don't spin underneath the train.

5664
02:16:35,650 --> 02:16:36,291
And it's showing you look,

5665
02:16:36,291 --> 02:16:40,690
the train is pushing the train tracks
back and the train tracks are pushing the

5666
02:16:40,691 --> 02:16:41,590
train forward when they're,

5667
02:16:41,591 --> 02:16:42,940
when they're connected to the ground.

5668
02:16:43,480 --> 02:16:43,691
So the,

5669
02:16:43,691 --> 02:16:44,740
when I put you on a treadmill,

5670
02:16:45,950 --> 02:16:47,560
you're pushing the treadmill behind you,

5671
02:16:48,130 --> 02:16:49,780
the treadmill's not pushing
you forward because it's,

5672
02:16:49,781 --> 02:16:50,920
it's spinning along with you.

5673
02:16:51,160 --> 02:16:52,450
And if I put you on the ground,

5674
02:16:52,750 --> 02:16:54,190
the ground is pushing you forward now,

5675
02:16:55,150 --> 02:16:56,590
so for every action has an opposite,

5676
02:16:56,591 --> 02:16:57,131
equal reaction.

5677
02:16:57,131 --> 02:16:57,964
I'm sure you heard this.

5678
02:16:58,750 --> 02:16:59,920
Then Einstein comes along and says,

5679
02:16:59,930 --> 02:17:00,051
no,

5680
02:17:00,051 --> 02:17:02,350
that's totally wrong
when it comes to gravity.

5681
02:17:02,410 --> 02:17:02,561
Okay?

5682
02:17:02,561 --> 02:17:04,030
When subject to gravity says,

5683
02:17:04,300 --> 02:17:05,530
because Isaac Newton says this,

5684
02:17:05,531 --> 02:17:05,681
look,

5685
02:17:05,681 --> 02:17:05,921
he says,

5686
02:17:05,921 --> 02:17:06,101
look,

5687
02:17:06,101 --> 02:17:07,750
the force of gravity is in the earth.

5688
02:17:08,020 --> 02:17:09,760
The earth has this invisible force,

5689
02:17:09,761 --> 02:17:11,170
this magical wool thing.

5690
02:17:11,171 --> 02:17:11,920
And that's what,

5691
02:17:11,920 --> 02:17:13,390
that's what is contemporary set about him.

5692
02:17:13,810 --> 02:17:14,680
That's what his pure said.

5693
02:17:14,681 --> 02:17:14,920
He said,

5694
02:17:14,920 --> 02:17:16,780
all you're appealing to magic.

5695
02:17:16,840 --> 02:17:18,310
What is gravity thing where it's not,

5696
02:17:18,340 --> 02:17:19,360
it's not comparable.

5697
02:17:19,361 --> 02:17:20,290
It's not material.

5698
02:17:20,920 --> 02:17:23,080
It's not made of a
substance is this magic.

5699
02:17:23,320 --> 02:17:23,681
And he was like,

5700
02:17:23,681 --> 02:17:23,921
yeah,

5701
02:17:23,921 --> 02:17:24,610
it's this forced.

5702
02:17:24,610 --> 02:17:25,151
You can't feel it.

5703
02:17:25,151 --> 02:17:25,901
You can detect it.

5704
02:17:25,901 --> 02:17:30,901
It's just observable in the nature and
for 300 years everybody believed that and

5705
02:17:31,271 --> 02:17:32,860
then I think as long says no,

5706
02:17:32,861 --> 02:17:33,820
you guys are totally wrong.

5707
02:17:34,030 --> 02:17:36,130
There is no mythical force called gravity.

5708
02:17:36,370 --> 02:17:37,540
It's a pushing force.

5709
02:17:37,541 --> 02:17:39,190
So really what he says is,

5710
02:17:39,400 --> 02:17:39,940
sorry,

5711
02:17:39,940 --> 02:17:40,151
let me,

5712
02:17:40,151 --> 02:17:41,200
let me get a sheet of paper here.

5713
02:17:41,410 --> 02:17:41,921
Make a really,

5714
02:17:41,921 --> 02:17:42,520
really simple,

5715
02:17:42,520 --> 02:17:44,170
and I'm going to put
it in a nutshell here.

5716
02:17:44,171 --> 02:17:44,351
Okay.

5717
02:17:44,351 --> 02:17:45,184
But okay,

5718
02:17:45,430 --> 02:17:46,180
this is,

5719
02:17:46,180 --> 02:17:46,541
he says,

5720
02:17:46,541 --> 02:17:46,691
look,

5721
02:17:46,691 --> 02:17:47,530
I just says look,

5722
02:17:47,560 --> 02:17:51,340
space and time are one space
is actually a thing out there.

5723
02:17:52,480 --> 02:17:53,190
It's actually a fee.

5724
02:17:53,190 --> 02:17:55,570
The space between me and you
is the actual physical thing.

5725
02:17:56,080 --> 02:17:58,150
He says the sun is so
heavy that it dents it,

5726
02:17:58,170 --> 02:17:58,680
that makes it,

5727
02:17:58,680 --> 02:18:02,290
it makes like a totally the bowl and the
earth is bumping around in that toilet

5728
02:18:02,291 --> 02:18:04,570
bowl because space is actually curved.

5729
02:18:05,800 --> 02:18:07,960
It's curved like this spaces
curve because the sun,

5730
02:18:07,961 --> 02:18:08,794
Imagine I put something,

5731
02:18:08,800 --> 02:18:09,790
a bowling ball on your bed.

5732
02:18:09,810 --> 02:18:09,941
You,

5733
02:18:09,941 --> 02:18:10,380
your,

5734
02:18:10,380 --> 02:18:13,090
your bed's going to indent that bolt,

5735
02:18:13,120 --> 02:18:15,550
that toilet bowl shape the world.

5736
02:18:15,580 --> 02:18:17,420
The earth is flooring around
that toilet bowl shape.

5737
02:18:17,421 --> 02:18:18,400
So it's a pushing force.

5738
02:18:18,401 --> 02:18:19,630
No longer a pulling force.

5739
02:18:21,100 --> 02:18:24,670
So the weight of the earth
is pushing down on space.

5740
02:18:24,700 --> 02:18:25,121
Exactly.

5741
02:18:25,121 --> 02:18:26,050
It's bending space.

5742
02:18:26,051 --> 02:18:28,000
Literally it's masses bending space.

5743
02:18:28,930 --> 02:18:31,390
Now Isaac Newton thought light
travels in a straight line only.

5744
02:18:31,870 --> 02:18:33,070
And to prove this,

5745
02:18:33,071 --> 02:18:33,611
Einstein said,

5746
02:18:33,611 --> 02:18:34,180
look,

5747
02:18:34,180 --> 02:18:36,550
light will bend if I'm right.

5748
02:18:36,551 --> 02:18:37,390
Light Bend.

5749
02:18:37,480 --> 02:18:40,330
So they observe the sun during an
eclipse and they saw that the light bends

5750
02:18:40,331 --> 02:18:41,710
light does not travel in a straight line.

5751
02:18:41,740 --> 02:18:42,573
This was another,

5752
02:18:42,820 --> 02:18:43,390
um,

5753
02:18:43,390 --> 02:18:43,720
uh,

5754
02:18:43,720 --> 02:18:44,610
belief there was debunked.

5755
02:18:44,620 --> 02:18:44,831
I mean,

5756
02:18:44,831 --> 02:18:49,831
how many scientific beliefs are debunked
countless or overturned because a

5757
02:18:50,081 --> 02:18:52,110
scientific fact is not
a mathematical fact.

5758
02:18:52,110 --> 02:18:56,590
They're two different things as
scientific fact and never go higher than

5759
02:18:56,591 --> 02:18:57,424
hypothesis.

5760
02:18:58,150 --> 02:19:00,490
If somebody understands
the philosophy of science,

5761
02:19:01,120 --> 02:19:05,410
he understands that every single
scientific fact is not equivalent to a

5762
02:19:05,411 --> 02:19:06,310
mathematical fact.

5763
02:19:06,311 --> 02:19:11,311
One plus one equals to a scientific fact
is always subject to cross examination

5764
02:19:12,431 --> 02:19:13,250
and new evidence.

5765
02:19:13,250 --> 02:19:13,360
Well,

5766
02:19:13,360 --> 02:19:15,940
you've ever heard of Thomas
Kuhn is very famous for that,

5767
02:19:15,941 --> 02:19:16,091
right?

5768
02:19:16,091 --> 02:19:16,990
We have a paradigm.

5769
02:19:17,830 --> 02:19:19,840
So during Aristotle's
time he had a paradigm.

5770
02:19:19,841 --> 02:19:21,130
You thought the sun goes around the earth.

5771
02:19:21,280 --> 02:19:22,570
It was an observational,

5772
02:19:22,900 --> 02:19:23,860
scientific fact.

5773
02:19:23,890 --> 02:19:25,630
Everyday he saw the sun
go around the earth.

5774
02:19:25,631 --> 02:19:26,464
Literally.

5775
02:19:26,470 --> 02:19:26,711
He said,

5776
02:19:26,711 --> 02:19:27,544
look guys,

5777
02:19:27,710 --> 02:19:28,010
I'm

5778
02:19:28,010 --> 02:19:30,020
using my senses to observe
the sun go around the earth.

5779
02:19:30,740 --> 02:19:31,940
And then one day we find that no,

5780
02:19:31,950 --> 02:19:33,080
that's an optical illusion.

5781
02:19:33,770 --> 02:19:36,440
It's not sure that the sun goes around
the earth is the earth goes around the

5782
02:19:36,441 --> 02:19:37,540
sun site.

5783
02:19:37,650 --> 02:19:39,140
They re scientific revolution.

5784
02:19:39,680 --> 02:19:41,450
Every scientific fact we have,

5785
02:19:41,451 --> 02:19:43,580
or theory including gravity,

5786
02:19:43,610 --> 02:19:45,170
because gravity became the law of gravity.

5787
02:19:45,171 --> 02:19:46,610
It wasn't a longer the theory of gravity,

5788
02:19:46,611 --> 02:19:48,410
it was so accepted became
the law of gravity.

5789
02:19:48,860 --> 02:19:49,520
Today we don't,

5790
02:19:49,520 --> 02:19:52,220
we don't understand gravity
as Einstein understood it.

5791
02:19:52,370 --> 02:19:52,761
Excuse me,

5792
02:19:52,761 --> 02:19:54,110
as Isaac Newton understood it.

5793
02:19:54,111 --> 02:19:55,370
We understand it completely backwards,

5794
02:19:55,371 --> 02:19:56,330
literally backwards now.

5795
02:19:57,080 --> 02:20:00,200
And that's true with every scientific
theory because science is always subject

5796
02:20:00,201 --> 02:20:04,340
to new evidence coming to light or the
difference between Isaac Newton living

5797
02:20:04,341 --> 02:20:05,090
with when,

5798
02:20:05,090 --> 02:20:07,250
whenever the fuck he
lived a long ass time ago,

5799
02:20:07,251 --> 02:20:10,070
300 years ago versus the science
that we're dealing with today.

5800
02:20:10,130 --> 02:20:11,060
Like it's a sense today,

5801
02:20:11,090 --> 02:20:11,960
but what we'll,

5802
02:20:11,961 --> 02:20:14,270
we'll do you see in the science of today?

5803
02:20:14,380 --> 02:20:16,310
Um Oh the biggest culprit.

5804
02:20:16,370 --> 02:20:16,840
Yes.

5805
02:20:16,840 --> 02:20:17,810
A randomness.

5806
02:20:18,710 --> 02:20:18,951
See,

5807
02:20:18,951 --> 02:20:21,620
it's funny cause I heard you just
conversation with the Sam Harris on

5808
02:20:21,640 --> 02:20:22,071
randomness,

5809
02:20:22,071 --> 02:20:22,910
which I loved by the way.

5810
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:23,833
You did a great job.

5811
02:20:24,400 --> 02:20:25,610
I thought it was a great conversation.

5812
02:20:26,030 --> 02:20:27,650
However he was giving you my opinion.

5813
02:20:27,651 --> 02:20:28,940
Two contradictory ideas was tell you,

5814
02:20:28,941 --> 02:20:32,210
look the world is determined but
also there'll be random events.

5815
02:20:32,540 --> 02:20:36,020
And I found that all he
was actually talking about
determinism versus free will,

5816
02:20:36,050 --> 02:20:36,830
right?

5817
02:20:36,830 --> 02:20:37,100
Yeah.

5818
02:20:37,100 --> 02:20:41,210
So the idea being that you don't
necessarily have free will that everything

5819
02:20:41,211 --> 02:20:44,270
about your decisions and what you're
going to do is based on your life

5820
02:20:44,271 --> 02:20:45,104
experiences,

5821
02:20:45,230 --> 02:20:46,070
your genetics,

5822
02:20:46,400 --> 02:20:49,250
all these variables that are
essentially out of your control.

5823
02:20:49,310 --> 02:20:52,010
So this idea of free will is an illusion,

5824
02:20:52,610 --> 02:20:55,190
which is a really complex conversation.

5825
02:20:55,340 --> 02:20:58,010
And I think you could see it in both ways.

5826
02:20:58,011 --> 02:21:02,480
I think you do have a certain
amount of control of your decisions.

5827
02:21:02,900 --> 02:21:07,460
And I think you were also shaped very
much so by your past and your genetics and

5828
02:21:07,610 --> 02:21:10,070
your interpretation of those events.

5829
02:21:10,220 --> 02:21:10,910
Um,

5830
02:21:10,910 --> 02:21:13,460
what are those interpretations
of those events though?

5831
02:21:13,461 --> 02:21:15,410
And why do you make those determinations?

5832
02:21:15,620 --> 02:21:16,251
W who,

5833
02:21:16,251 --> 02:21:16,980
who's,

5834
02:21:16,980 --> 02:21:18,500
who's in your head pulling the gears?

5835
02:21:18,501 --> 02:21:19,770
Like what?

5836
02:21:20,210 --> 02:21:21,050
What are you,

5837
02:21:21,140 --> 02:21:23,870
I'm a hard determinist like
I'm a very hard determinist.

5838
02:21:23,890 --> 02:21:24,610
Like I'm,

5839
02:21:24,610 --> 02:21:26,240
I'm like determinist extremist,

5840
02:21:26,960 --> 02:21:28,580
so but do you believe in free will?

5841
02:21:28,640 --> 02:21:29,660
I also believe in free will,

5842
02:21:29,661 --> 02:21:30,200
which is,

5843
02:21:30,200 --> 02:21:30,830
which is to,

5844
02:21:30,830 --> 02:21:31,663
which is tricky.

5845
02:21:31,670 --> 02:21:31,930
Yeah.

5846
02:21:31,930 --> 02:21:32,420
It's tricky,

5847
02:21:32,420 --> 02:21:34,610
but I think that's what it's true.

5848
02:21:34,611 --> 02:21:36,500
A potting the both further examination.

5849
02:21:36,800 --> 02:21:37,820
I think that there's,

5850
02:21:37,850 --> 02:21:41,090
there is something that allows people to,

5851
02:21:41,360 --> 02:21:41,911
I mean what,

5852
02:21:41,911 --> 02:21:45,580
what takes the guy was 500 pounds and
all of sudden he goes on a Keto diet and

5853
02:21:45,600 --> 02:21:48,290
starts running and who
starts walking in the knee,

5854
02:21:48,500 --> 02:21:50,060
he sends you a picture on Twitter.

5855
02:21:50,060 --> 02:21:52,070
I lost 179 pounds in six months.

5856
02:21:52,071 --> 02:21:52,281
You're like,

5857
02:21:52,281 --> 02:21:53,180
Holy Shit,

5858
02:21:53,480 --> 02:21:54,410
how the fuck did you do?

5859
02:21:55,040 --> 02:21:57,620
Like that guy has some
fucking wheel man to say that.

5860
02:21:57,621 --> 02:22:01,970
That's his whole life and his life
experiences and as genetics it's like,

5861
02:22:02,360 --> 02:22:02,930
yes,

5862
02:22:02,930 --> 02:22:04,100
I could see what you're saying.

5863
02:22:04,101 --> 02:22:05,380
I could see that he,

5864
02:22:05,430 --> 02:22:09,680
he had enough because of his
life experiences and that
it led to him making this

5865
02:22:09,681 --> 02:22:10,370
change,

5866
02:22:10,370 --> 02:22:14,990
but this is a tremendous amount of will
involved in that and to deny that seems

5867
02:22:14,991 --> 02:22:17,420
like you're denying the
spirit of human beings.

5868
02:22:17,990 --> 02:22:18,291
Well,

5869
02:22:18,291 --> 02:22:19,071
let's look at it this way.

5870
02:22:19,071 --> 02:22:19,281
Okay,

5871
02:22:19,281 --> 02:22:19,700
real quick,

5872
02:22:19,700 --> 02:22:20,480
let's look at it like,

5873
02:22:20,480 --> 02:22:20,691
okay,

5874
02:22:20,691 --> 02:22:21,950
let's say a couple of this piece of paper

5875
02:22:23,900 --> 02:22:24,860
and I'm going to catapult it.

5876
02:22:25,110 --> 02:22:25,943
Okay,

5877
02:22:26,540 --> 02:22:27,373
in Atlanta there,

5878
02:22:27,390 --> 02:22:28,020
right,

5879
02:22:28,020 --> 02:22:29,910
and I'm going to reset
the entire universe.

5880
02:22:30,840 --> 02:22:32,690
I'm going to reset every molecule there.

5881
02:22:32,760 --> 02:22:34,380
Every fiber in this paper,

5882
02:22:34,590 --> 02:22:36,000
you're going to be in the exact same spot.

5883
02:22:36,060 --> 02:22:38,380
The whole universe has
been reset and a fire.

5884
02:22:38,381 --> 02:22:39,214
It again,

5885
02:22:39,450 --> 02:22:42,570
isn't going to land exactly
where it landed the first time,

5886
02:22:43,290 --> 02:22:44,700
or is it going to land somewhere else?

5887
02:22:45,450 --> 02:22:46,620
I've reset the universe.

5888
02:22:47,010 --> 02:22:48,570
The earth was the earth.

5889
02:22:48,690 --> 02:22:51,690
Every molecule of matter in the every,

5890
02:22:51,691 --> 02:22:52,260
every,

5891
02:22:52,260 --> 02:22:55,890
every particle of matter in the universe
has been reset with the same amount of

5892
02:22:55,891 --> 02:22:56,520
force.

5893
02:22:56,520 --> 02:22:57,690
Everything is identical.

5894
02:22:57,691 --> 02:23:01,920
I would assume if the same amount
of space and the same amount of air,

5895
02:23:02,070 --> 02:23:04,350
you would land the same spot infinitely.

5896
02:23:04,351 --> 02:23:05,184
Precisely.

5897
02:23:05,850 --> 02:23:07,650
I don't know what every set,

5898
02:23:07,651 --> 02:23:08,550
everything perfectly,

5899
02:23:09,100 --> 02:23:09,811
infinitely,

5900
02:23:09,811 --> 02:23:10,531
precisely.

5901
02:23:10,531 --> 02:23:14,820
You throw it a dax exact same way and
it lands in the exact same dirt with the

5902
02:23:14,821 --> 02:23:16,080
exact same resistance.

5903
02:23:16,320 --> 02:23:17,153
It's the same thing.

5904
02:23:17,220 --> 02:23:21,300
I would assume it's infinitely precisely
going to land the same spot if random.

5905
02:23:21,301 --> 02:23:23,430
This is a force at work in nature.

5906
02:23:24,180 --> 02:23:28,260
Why did [inaudible] factor itself
into our little experiment here?

5907
02:23:28,320 --> 02:23:29,220
Cause you little experiments.

5908
02:23:29,221 --> 02:23:30,054
Impossible.

5909
02:23:30,120 --> 02:23:30,900
But that's irrelevance.

5910
02:23:30,900 --> 02:23:31,733
A thought experiment.

5911
02:23:31,890 --> 02:23:32,470
But it's,

5912
02:23:32,470 --> 02:23:35,520
it's not creating a logical universe.

5913
02:23:35,610 --> 02:23:35,761
Right,

5914
02:23:35,761 --> 02:23:36,990
but it's not logically impossible.

5915
02:23:37,010 --> 02:23:37,230
Right?

5916
02:23:37,230 --> 02:23:37,351
Well,

5917
02:23:37,351 --> 02:23:38,520
in that case though,

5918
02:23:38,521 --> 02:23:40,410
with the variables that you presented.

5919
02:23:40,440 --> 02:23:41,250
Yes.

5920
02:23:41,250 --> 02:23:41,790
Okay,

5921
02:23:41,790 --> 02:23:42,710
well where's randomness?

5922
02:23:42,720 --> 02:23:43,081
Where's this?

5923
02:23:43,081 --> 02:23:44,400
Four is no randomness.

5924
02:23:44,401 --> 02:23:48,780
If you're recreating the entire earth
in a in a very duplicatable way,

5925
02:23:48,781 --> 02:23:50,160
that's not randomness at all.

5926
02:23:50,161 --> 02:23:50,730
It is random.

5927
02:23:50,730 --> 02:23:51,150
There's nothing.

5928
02:23:51,150 --> 02:23:52,140
There is no randomness,

5929
02:23:52,170 --> 02:23:52,620
right?

5930
02:23:52,620 --> 02:23:52,981
Random.

5931
02:23:52,981 --> 02:23:56,830
This is when a human being can no
longer compute all the factors and he,

5932
02:23:56,840 --> 02:23:58,500
we use an expression called randomness,

5933
02:23:58,501 --> 02:23:59,130
meaning,

5934
02:23:59,130 --> 02:23:59,371
okay,

5935
02:23:59,371 --> 02:24:01,770
I rolled the dice had
landed on on seven randomly.

5936
02:24:02,130 --> 02:24:02,401
Why?

5937
02:24:02,401 --> 02:24:05,280
Because I couldn't
compute all the variables.

5938
02:24:05,300 --> 02:24:05,520
Okay.

5939
02:24:05,520 --> 02:24:05,810
Series.

5940
02:24:05,810 --> 02:24:06,581
So the random,

5941
02:24:06,581 --> 02:24:07,530
this is kind of a,

5942
02:24:07,920 --> 02:24:08,221
it's a,

5943
02:24:08,221 --> 02:24:10,560
it's an illusion that we
project onto the world.

5944
02:24:10,770 --> 02:24:11,431
So La Plas,

5945
02:24:11,431 --> 02:24:13,350
one of the greatest physicists in history,

5946
02:24:13,710 --> 02:24:14,030
okay.

5947
02:24:14,030 --> 02:24:14,910
A similar place.

5948
02:24:14,911 --> 02:24:15,181
He says,

5949
02:24:15,181 --> 02:24:15,870
look,

5950
02:24:15,870 --> 02:24:17,100
look at a billiard ball table.

5951
02:24:17,730 --> 02:24:17,941
Okay?

5952
02:24:17,941 --> 02:24:20,310
If you tell me which way you're
going to break the billiard balls,

5953
02:24:20,520 --> 02:24:24,030
if you tell me what philocity and what
angle you're gonna hit the cue ball,

5954
02:24:24,720 --> 02:24:28,890
I could tell you where every single
ball is going to be on the pool table.

5955
02:24:29,100 --> 02:24:30,000
That's what laplace says.

5956
02:24:30,001 --> 02:24:30,270
Okay?

5957
02:24:30,270 --> 02:24:31,590
He's a phenomenal thinker.

5958
02:24:32,550 --> 02:24:32,941
And he says,

5959
02:24:32,941 --> 02:24:33,151
why?

5960
02:24:33,151 --> 02:24:34,320
Because I'm going to take that table.

5961
02:24:34,321 --> 02:24:35,400
I'm going to turn it to a math.

5962
02:24:35,430 --> 02:24:36,480
I'm going to take the weight of the ball.

5963
02:24:36,481 --> 02:24:37,380
The friction of the table,

5964
02:24:37,381 --> 02:24:37,541
the,

5965
02:24:37,541 --> 02:24:38,730
the density of the bands,

5966
02:24:38,731 --> 02:24:38,941
the,

5967
02:24:38,941 --> 02:24:39,111
the,

5968
02:24:39,111 --> 02:24:39,411
the,

5969
02:24:39,411 --> 02:24:40,860
the gravity of the earth.

5970
02:24:40,920 --> 02:24:41,753
Excuse me.

5971
02:24:41,910 --> 02:24:43,170
I'm going to take all those variables.

5972
02:24:43,890 --> 02:24:45,300
I'm going to put them
up on this board here.

5973
02:24:45,690 --> 02:24:48,720
All they need to know is how hard you
can hit the ball and I'll tell you

5974
02:24:48,721 --> 02:24:50,350
precisely where every
ball is going to lend.

5975
02:24:51,030 --> 02:24:51,151
Now,

5976
02:24:51,151 --> 02:24:54,840
somebody who doesn't know mathematics or
geometry is going to look at that table

5977
02:24:54,870 --> 02:24:56,400
when he sees the break to him.

5978
02:24:56,401 --> 02:24:58,590
It's going to seem random but random.

5979
02:24:58,591 --> 02:25:00,120
This is really a reflection
of his ignorance.

5980
02:25:00,121 --> 02:25:02,010
He's not able to compute
all this information.

5981
02:25:03,030 --> 02:25:06,870
That's why the plas says to God the
world is not random to somebody who has

5982
02:25:06,871 --> 02:25:07,704
information.

5983
02:25:08,010 --> 02:25:08,910
The world is not random.

5984
02:25:09,360 --> 02:25:11,250
That's why he says it was very important.

5985
02:25:11,251 --> 02:25:11,520
That's weight.

5986
02:25:11,520 --> 02:25:14,520
That's why we're sold deterministic
because we believe that what's happening

5987
02:25:14,521 --> 02:25:16,710
right now is a byproduct of the past.

5988
02:25:17,850 --> 02:25:19,530
The past caused this happening right now.

5989
02:25:19,740 --> 02:25:22,260
The past was out of your control.

5990
02:25:22,530 --> 02:25:23,920
If I the universe

5991
02:25:24,130 --> 02:25:25,270
and let it play all over again,

5992
02:25:25,330 --> 02:25:26,980
I identical circumstances,

5993
02:25:27,280 --> 02:25:29,650
you would drink that exact same
amount of coffee you had today.

5994
02:25:29,920 --> 02:25:30,780
You would have made the same,

5995
02:25:30,920 --> 02:25:31,990
have married the same woman,

5996
02:25:31,991 --> 02:25:32,801
you would have had the same kids.

5997
02:25:32,801 --> 02:25:34,330
You would have had the same t shirt on.

5998
02:25:34,331 --> 02:25:35,980
Right now you would have
the Mike at the same.

5999
02:25:35,981 --> 02:25:37,720
This everything would be reset.

6000
02:25:37,750 --> 02:25:40,480
So when we look at the world
through the eyes of physics,

6001
02:25:42,100 --> 02:25:45,130
they say the cause of Linus
complete the cause of Linus.

6002
02:25:45,160 --> 02:25:49,390
Complete meaning where is this
space for randomness or freewill?

6003
02:25:49,970 --> 02:25:51,730
It w we don't factor it in.

6004
02:25:52,150 --> 02:25:55,900
The only time we do factor it in is
when we look at ourselves inwardly.

6005
02:25:56,290 --> 02:25:58,720
But when we look at the world
objectively as a third person,

6006
02:25:59,920 --> 02:26:01,000
so there's two views.

6007
02:26:01,001 --> 02:26:02,860
There's an internal view
of first person experience.

6008
02:26:03,250 --> 02:26:04,083
We don't believe,

6009
02:26:04,180 --> 02:26:06,520
we don't believe in determinism.

6010
02:26:06,550 --> 02:26:06,880
We were,

6011
02:26:06,880 --> 02:26:07,713
we have free will.

6012
02:26:08,050 --> 02:26:09,280
That's first person experience.

6013
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:11,110
Third Person Experience.

6014
02:26:11,111 --> 02:26:12,130
I'm studying Joe.

6015
02:26:12,640 --> 02:26:14,470
All I see in Joe is billiard balls.

6016
02:26:14,530 --> 02:26:15,281
So when you have a thought,

6017
02:26:15,281 --> 02:26:16,810
it's all billiard balls
hitting one another.

6018
02:26:17,540 --> 02:26:20,080
And if I had an infinitely
precise calculator,

6019
02:26:20,500 --> 02:26:21,580
it according to the a plus,

6020
02:26:21,610 --> 02:26:24,370
I could tell you where you're
going to be five years from now,

6021
02:26:24,371 --> 02:26:25,204
what you're going to be doing.

6022
02:26:25,540 --> 02:26:25,751
Why?

6023
02:26:25,751 --> 02:26:27,520
Because I'm seeing one
billiard ball hit another.

6024
02:26:27,820 --> 02:26:29,260
It's just take that pool table,

6025
02:26:29,261 --> 02:26:33,100
experiment and make it the
greatest pool game in history.

6026
02:26:34,060 --> 02:26:35,320
There are countless atoms.

6027
02:26:35,321 --> 02:26:37,570
There are countless billiard
balls striking into one another.

6028
02:26:37,900 --> 02:26:41,990
Somebody can calculate the
world of physics and tell
you where your hand's going

6029
02:26:41,991 --> 02:26:42,161
to be.

6030
02:26:42,161 --> 02:26:42,641
Laplas says,

6031
02:26:42,641 --> 02:26:44,710
I'm going to tell you where your hand's
going to be in five years from now,

6032
02:26:45,250 --> 02:26:46,570
but you don't know my personal choices.

6033
02:26:46,571 --> 02:26:47,020
I'm going to make it.

6034
02:26:47,020 --> 02:26:47,853
That's irrelevant.

6035
02:26:48,700 --> 02:26:49,391
That's a way he'll tell you.

6036
02:26:49,391 --> 02:26:49,901
That's irrelevant.

6037
02:26:49,901 --> 02:26:50,350
Why?

6038
02:26:50,350 --> 02:26:52,480
Because he sees the billiard
balls moving inside your mind,

6039
02:26:52,481 --> 02:26:53,314
so to speak.

6040
02:26:54,490 --> 02:26:57,130
Now Leipnetz reconcile
the two because see,

6041
02:26:57,131 --> 02:26:57,964
for instance,

6042
02:26:58,180 --> 02:26:58,600
when I,

6043
02:26:58,600 --> 02:27:00,370
when I living in the first person,

6044
02:27:00,371 --> 02:27:01,300
this is my intuition,

6045
02:27:01,960 --> 02:27:02,231
I'm like,

6046
02:27:02,231 --> 02:27:02,381
Hey,

6047
02:27:02,381 --> 02:27:03,850
I grabbed that Coffee Cup of coffee.

6048
02:27:04,180 --> 02:27:05,650
I had this internal experience.

6049
02:27:05,651 --> 02:27:06,850
It's outside of physics.

6050
02:27:07,990 --> 02:27:09,760
So Lyman has gives a great example.

6051
02:27:09,761 --> 02:27:10,031
He says,

6052
02:27:10,031 --> 02:27:10,864
look,

6053
02:27:11,440 --> 02:27:12,191
if I was really,

6054
02:27:12,191 --> 02:27:13,810
really tiny and I'd walk
around in your mind,

6055
02:27:14,920 --> 02:27:16,210
I would see blood flow.

6056
02:27:16,211 --> 02:27:17,620
I would see neurons firing.

6057
02:27:17,650 --> 02:27:21,460
I would see all sorts of
biological interactions,

6058
02:27:22,420 --> 02:27:24,160
but I wouldn't see
anything of consciousness.

6059
02:27:24,730 --> 02:27:25,690
I wouldn't see your thoughts.

6060
02:27:25,691 --> 02:27:27,880
I wouldn't see you
thinking about your wife,

6061
02:27:27,910 --> 02:27:28,331
a hearing,

6062
02:27:28,331 --> 02:27:29,320
your child's voice,

6063
02:27:29,650 --> 02:27:30,910
thinking about what you
want to have for dinner.

6064
02:27:30,911 --> 02:27:31,744
I wouldn't see any of that.

6065
02:27:32,350 --> 02:27:34,450
I would just see billiard
balls hitting one another.

6066
02:27:35,440 --> 02:27:36,273
However,

6067
02:27:37,240 --> 02:27:39,430
now that I'm having this
first person experience,

6068
02:27:39,610 --> 02:27:40,960
there's something we call intuition.

6069
02:27:40,990 --> 02:27:42,550
This first person experience itself,

6070
02:27:42,760 --> 02:27:46,510
you're having this spiritual
type of transcendent experience.

6071
02:27:46,630 --> 02:27:48,760
What it's like to have a thought,

6072
02:27:48,790 --> 02:27:49,810
what it's like to be me.

6073
02:27:50,140 --> 02:27:50,973
So for instance,

6074
02:27:51,160 --> 02:27:52,300
I see the cup of coffee,

6075
02:27:53,920 --> 02:27:55,720
I desire the cup of coffee and I drink it.

6076
02:27:56,170 --> 02:27:59,560
Science has nothing that has no
information about my conscious experience,

6077
02:27:59,561 --> 02:28:00,830
my intuitive experience it.

6078
02:28:00,831 --> 02:28:02,940
The science is not absolute.

6079
02:28:02,941 --> 02:28:04,690
It cannot tell me everything
about the universe.

6080
02:28:04,960 --> 02:28:06,730
It could only tell me
about the billiard balls.

6081
02:28:06,731 --> 02:28:07,840
It can only go so far.

6082
02:28:08,500 --> 02:28:08,951
At that point,

6083
02:28:08,951 --> 02:28:11,440
it has to stop because it doesn't have,

6084
02:28:11,441 --> 02:28:12,274
we don't,

6085
02:28:12,640 --> 02:28:14,470
our senses cannot sense.

6086
02:28:14,471 --> 02:28:15,970
The conscious experience
that we're having.

6087
02:28:16,810 --> 02:28:18,910
The conscious experience
is only known intuitively.

6088
02:28:19,420 --> 02:28:20,680
So first person experience,

6089
02:28:21,280 --> 02:28:22,280
so 11 it says this.

6090
02:28:22,281 --> 02:28:22,491
It says,

6091
02:28:22,491 --> 02:28:22,701
look,

6092
02:28:22,701 --> 02:28:24,260
you look at the world
when you study the world,

6093
02:28:24,261 --> 02:28:26,030
we're all seeing billiard
balls hitting one another.

6094
02:28:26,270 --> 02:28:27,260
Nobody argues about that.

6095
02:28:27,890 --> 02:28:28,281
However,

6096
02:28:28,281 --> 02:28:30,170
our intuition is telling
as that's all untrue.

6097
02:28:30,680 --> 02:28:31,550
We have the chat.

6098
02:28:31,580 --> 02:28:33,350
We have the ability to move our own hand,

6099
02:28:33,650 --> 02:28:34,550
desire something,

6100
02:28:34,551 --> 02:28:35,270
grab something,

6101
02:28:35,270 --> 02:28:35,781
eat something,

6102
02:28:35,781 --> 02:28:36,501
consumed something,

6103
02:28:36,501 --> 02:28:37,334
make a choice.

6104
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:38,421
And he says,

6105
02:28:38,421 --> 02:28:39,260
how are the two,

6106
02:28:39,410 --> 02:28:40,820
how can they coexist?

6107
02:28:41,600 --> 02:28:45,810
Because remember in reason for me to
accept something as logically true after

6108
02:28:45,830 --> 02:28:47,210
eliminate every other possibility.

6109
02:28:47,810 --> 02:28:49,310
So he found the one possibility,

6110
02:28:49,640 --> 02:28:53,090
one possibility that till
today it's never been refuted.

6111
02:28:53,720 --> 02:28:55,970
He says that he calls
it the the twin trains.

6112
02:28:56,690 --> 02:28:57,650
So picture two trains.

6113
02:28:57,651 --> 02:28:58,484
Okay?

6114
02:28:59,060 --> 02:29:00,260
They're going up and down,

6115
02:29:00,470 --> 02:29:01,310
side by side,

6116
02:29:01,311 --> 02:29:02,360
traveling at the same speed.

6117
02:29:03,500 --> 02:29:05,360
They look like they're
connected to one another,

6118
02:29:05,570 --> 02:29:06,403
but they're not.

6119
02:29:06,440 --> 02:29:07,370
They're just synchronized.

6120
02:29:08,480 --> 02:29:09,380
Every time one goes left,

6121
02:29:09,381 --> 02:29:10,011
the other one goes left,

6122
02:29:10,011 --> 02:29:10,431
one goes up,

6123
02:29:10,431 --> 02:29:11,264
one goes down.

6124
02:29:12,170 --> 02:29:14,570
And so when I lighten this tells you,

6125
02:29:14,571 --> 02:29:14,811
it says,

6126
02:29:14,811 --> 02:29:14,961
look,

6127
02:29:14,961 --> 02:29:16,400
when you reach for that cup of coffee,

6128
02:29:16,760 --> 02:29:20,330
the universe had already decided millions
of billions of years ago that that was

6129
02:29:20,331 --> 02:29:21,164
going to happen.

6130
02:29:21,710 --> 02:29:24,230
Your intuitive sense just
coincides with it perfectly.

6131
02:29:27,050 --> 02:29:28,910
And he said that's what he
calls a twin trains theory.

6132
02:29:28,911 --> 02:29:33,911
That the correlation theory that your
desire to grab that cup of coffee doesn't

6133
02:29:34,731 --> 02:29:35,564
affect your hand,

6134
02:29:35,750 --> 02:29:36,620
does not move your hand.

6135
02:29:36,621 --> 02:29:37,281
That'll be impossible.

6136
02:29:37,281 --> 02:29:38,750
There'll be something nonphysical moving,

6137
02:29:38,751 --> 02:29:39,590
something physical.

6138
02:29:40,580 --> 02:29:42,320
So he says that they're
just correlated perfectly.

6139
02:29:42,321 --> 02:29:44,840
When you ask them how do
they correlate so perfectly,

6140
02:29:44,841 --> 02:29:45,081
he says,

6141
02:29:45,081 --> 02:29:45,500
well God,

6142
02:29:45,500 --> 02:29:48,140
it's like God took the girls the
greatest pool shot in history.

6143
02:29:50,980 --> 02:29:51,640
This is like nuts.

6144
02:29:51,640 --> 02:29:52,061
This is a,

6145
02:29:52,061 --> 02:29:52,894
he's a,

6146
02:29:53,080 --> 02:29:54,910
he's the guy who invented the calculus,

6147
02:29:55,440 --> 02:29:56,320
the binary code,

6148
02:29:56,321 --> 02:29:56,441
you know,

6149
02:29:56,441 --> 02:29:57,490
like all our computers.

6150
02:29:57,491 --> 02:29:59,170
So they work cause of
the cause of Lebanon's.

6151
02:30:01,510 --> 02:30:02,343
That

6152
02:30:02,450 --> 02:30:04,160
to me is a hard sell.

6153
02:30:04,340 --> 02:30:04,840
Yeah.

6154
02:30:04,840 --> 02:30:06,200
So most people can't wrap
their mind around it.

6155
02:30:06,230 --> 02:30:06,710
Yeah.

6156
02:30:06,710 --> 02:30:07,700
It's a hard sell.

6157
02:30:08,300 --> 02:30:08,811
First of all,

6158
02:30:08,811 --> 02:30:10,380
he can see a woman come,

6159
02:30:10,870 --> 02:30:12,320
created the first computer code.

6160
02:30:13,250 --> 02:30:13,461
Uh,

6161
02:30:13,461 --> 02:30:13,730
he,

6162
02:30:13,730 --> 02:30:16,660
he invented the binary code
binary combine they Rico,

6163
02:30:16,661 --> 02:30:17,321
not computer code,

6164
02:30:17,321 --> 02:30:18,620
but it's based on binary.

6165
02:30:18,920 --> 02:30:20,180
Now when he sang,

6166
02:30:20,240 --> 02:30:21,260
he sang this,

6167
02:30:21,261 --> 02:30:25,550
that your desire coincides
with the universe having this.

6168
02:30:25,970 --> 02:30:27,590
That seems like a lot of woo.

6169
02:30:27,650 --> 02:30:29,330
That seems like why a bit of a stretch.

6170
02:30:29,360 --> 02:30:30,190
That's interesting point.

6171
02:30:30,190 --> 02:30:30,590
Tell me why.

6172
02:30:30,590 --> 02:30:30,921
Well,

6173
02:30:30,921 --> 02:30:35,050
why would the universe have a
plan for you and your mother?

6174
02:30:35,051 --> 02:30:35,421
He's saying,

6175
02:30:35,421 --> 02:30:35,631
God,

6176
02:30:35,631 --> 02:30:36,770
he's saying God directly.

6177
02:30:36,800 --> 02:30:37,633
Well,

6178
02:30:38,540 --> 02:30:39,373
prove that.

6179
02:30:39,620 --> 02:30:39,771
Okay.

6180
02:30:39,771 --> 02:30:40,280
That's a great,

6181
02:30:40,280 --> 02:30:41,113
that's a great,

6182
02:30:41,270 --> 02:30:42,103
that's a great objection.

6183
02:30:42,470 --> 02:30:44,660
Why would you say that it would be gone?

6184
02:30:44,790 --> 02:30:45,950
Argument wasn't to prove God.

6185
02:30:45,951 --> 02:30:46,650
This argument

6186
02:30:46,650 --> 02:30:49,070
was to tell you that

6187
02:30:49,610 --> 02:30:50,780
this is a possibility.

6188
02:30:50,930 --> 02:30:53,990
Why you have freewill is
true and so is determinism.

6189
02:30:54,180 --> 02:30:54,680
Yes.

6190
02:30:54,680 --> 02:30:57,560
Because can you deny freewill aren't
you're having a direct experience of

6191
02:30:57,610 --> 02:30:58,443
freewill?

6192
02:30:58,630 --> 02:30:58,820
Well,

6193
02:30:58,820 --> 02:31:02,150
the only denial of freewill
would be determinism.

6194
02:31:02,180 --> 02:31:05,810
The only denial would be that your
idea of freewill is an illusion.

6195
02:31:05,811 --> 02:31:08,750
It's you are really shaped
by the momentum of your past,

6196
02:31:09,110 --> 02:31:10,040
your genetics,

6197
02:31:10,370 --> 02:31:11,840
live experiences,

6198
02:31:11,900 --> 02:31:16,460
all the variables and the way you've
absorbed emotions and interactions with

6199
02:31:16,461 --> 02:31:18,170
people and that these are flavored.

6200
02:31:18,500 --> 02:31:21,810
Your very being to the point when
when presented with an obstacle or an

6201
02:31:21,811 --> 02:31:23,070
opportunity or a thing,

6202
02:31:23,270 --> 02:31:27,300
there is a predetermined solution in
your mind for whatever the situation is.

6203
02:31:27,510 --> 02:31:28,620
That's determinism.

6204
02:31:28,800 --> 02:31:29,071
Okay,

6205
02:31:29,071 --> 02:31:29,480
so

6206
02:31:29,480 --> 02:31:29,710
let,

6207
02:31:29,710 --> 02:31:30,031
let's,

6208
02:31:30,031 --> 02:31:30,300
uh,

6209
02:31:30,300 --> 02:31:30,570
let's,

6210
02:31:30,570 --> 02:31:32,490
let's say action rather than solution.

6211
02:31:32,520 --> 02:31:35,400
Let's take a step back and look at
what five minutes is trying to say.

6212
02:31:35,430 --> 02:31:36,180
Okay.

6213
02:31:36,180 --> 02:31:36,811
He's trying to say,

6214
02:31:36,811 --> 02:31:37,051
look,

6215
02:31:37,051 --> 02:31:38,670
there's three ways of
knowing something and yeah.

6216
02:31:38,700 --> 02:31:40,080
Evidence that this is a
brilliant human being.

6217
02:31:40,170 --> 02:31:40,770
Okay?

6218
02:31:40,770 --> 02:31:41,431
Not many,

6219
02:31:41,431 --> 02:31:41,670
many,

6220
02:31:41,670 --> 02:31:43,980
many men have said the same
thing throughout history.

6221
02:31:44,360 --> 02:31:45,193
Let's,

6222
02:31:45,480 --> 02:31:47,240
let's just at least entertain it.

6223
02:31:47,820 --> 02:31:48,091
He says,

6224
02:31:48,091 --> 02:31:48,241
look,

6225
02:31:48,241 --> 02:31:51,600
you know something empirically
through your senses.

6226
02:31:52,250 --> 02:31:53,083
Okay,

6227
02:31:53,130 --> 02:31:53,761
you touch fire,

6228
02:31:53,761 --> 02:31:54,594
it's hot.

6229
02:31:54,930 --> 02:31:55,770
Then you can know something.

6230
02:31:55,830 --> 02:31:59,220
Deductively one plus one
equals two via logic.

6231
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:04,230
Then you could know something intuitively
meaning direct first experience.

6232
02:32:04,710 --> 02:32:05,530
Okay,

6233
02:32:05,530 --> 02:32:06,330
so let's,

6234
02:32:06,330 --> 02:32:07,163
so let's say,

6235
02:32:08,520 --> 02:32:09,510
let's say you tell me,

6236
02:32:09,900 --> 02:32:10,380
I dunno.

6237
02:32:10,380 --> 02:32:11,213
Um,

6238
02:32:11,910 --> 02:32:14,310
I've had the coffee tastes great.

6239
02:32:14,850 --> 02:32:18,750
You don't know that
deductively or empirically the
sensation of coffee tasting

6240
02:32:18,751 --> 02:32:20,220
great is known intuitively.

6241
02:32:20,221 --> 02:32:22,620
Direct meaning there is no,

6242
02:32:23,010 --> 02:32:23,580
um,

6243
02:32:23,580 --> 02:32:27,240
there is no interpreter and philosophy.

6244
02:32:27,241 --> 02:32:29,270
We something called the
egocentric predicament.

6245
02:32:30,200 --> 02:32:35,030
So right now you're experiencing this
entire room within your consciousness,

6246
02:32:35,390 --> 02:32:35,870
right?

6247
02:32:35,870 --> 02:32:38,750
[inaudible] I might be
outside of Your Eagle,

6248
02:32:38,751 --> 02:32:39,260
but I'm,

6249
02:32:39,260 --> 02:32:41,240
I'm occurring right now
in your consciousness.

6250
02:32:42,640 --> 02:32:47,640
Did you see the difference perceiving
you saw in my consciousness or with my

6251
02:32:48,551 --> 02:32:49,384
consciousness,

6252
02:32:49,420 --> 02:32:51,880
which is connected to my senses?

6253
02:32:51,910 --> 02:32:54,430
Is there anything you can perceive
outside of your consciousness?

6254
02:32:58,290 --> 02:33:00,850
That's a weird say way of saying
something that's impossible,

6255
02:33:01,090 --> 02:33:03,850
but perceiving outside
of my consciousness,

6256
02:33:03,851 --> 02:33:05,440
meaning not being,

6257
02:33:05,890 --> 02:33:06,940
not conscious,

6258
02:33:06,941 --> 02:33:08,290
but yet still perceiving.

6259
02:33:08,650 --> 02:33:08,981
No.

6260
02:33:08,981 --> 02:33:10,210
When you perceive something,

6261
02:33:10,211 --> 02:33:12,490
it has to be within your consciousness,

6262
02:33:12,520 --> 02:33:12,731
right?

6263
02:33:12,731 --> 02:33:14,710
You have to or with your consciousness,

6264
02:33:15,250 --> 02:33:15,820
right?

6265
02:33:15,820 --> 02:33:16,990
It cannot be outside of your branch.

6266
02:33:16,991 --> 02:33:19,090
So even if something touches your skin,

6267
02:33:19,120 --> 02:33:21,910
you're consciously recognizing
that it touches your skin.

6268
02:33:23,450 --> 02:33:24,283
Um,

6269
02:33:24,520 --> 02:33:25,240
the egocentric,

6270
02:33:25,240 --> 02:33:28,570
but they come in is more about your
whole universe is made up of your

6271
02:33:28,571 --> 02:33:29,200
consciousness.

6272
02:33:29,200 --> 02:33:33,280
You cannot sense anything or experience
anything or get any information outside

6273
02:33:33,281 --> 02:33:33,791
of your conscious.

6274
02:33:33,791 --> 02:33:34,900
Like cotton was very big on this.

6275
02:33:34,901 --> 02:33:35,141
He's like,

6276
02:33:35,141 --> 02:33:35,800
look this,

6277
02:33:35,800 --> 02:33:36,880
this is called idealism.

6278
02:33:37,730 --> 02:33:39,970
The whole world is happening
on inside your head,

6279
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:40,211
right?

6280
02:33:40,211 --> 02:33:40,901
Supposedly likes,

6281
02:33:40,901 --> 02:33:41,261
for instance,

6282
02:33:41,261 --> 02:33:42,250
you see this cup of coffee,

6283
02:33:42,520 --> 02:33:45,460
they're going to say like
clusters hit the cup of coffee.

6284
02:33:45,490 --> 02:33:46,241
It goes into your eye,

6285
02:33:46,241 --> 02:33:46,960
your eye,

6286
02:33:46,960 --> 02:33:47,411
your eye.

6287
02:33:47,411 --> 02:33:48,430
It gives your brain a signal.

6288
02:33:48,431 --> 02:33:48,790
You're sick.

6289
02:33:48,790 --> 02:33:51,370
Your brain interprets the signal and
creates this universe around you.

6290
02:33:51,660 --> 02:33:52,493
Creates this image,

6291
02:33:52,900 --> 02:33:53,770
the theater of your mind.

6292
02:33:53,771 --> 02:33:54,604
Yeah.

6293
02:33:55,030 --> 02:33:57,370
Can you experience anything
outside the theater of your mind?

6294
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:03,710
Very difficult to argue that you could.

6295
02:34:03,950 --> 02:34:04,640
It's impossible.

6296
02:34:04,640 --> 02:34:05,060
Yeah.

6297
02:34:05,060 --> 02:34:07,100
According to all the
philosophers in history,

6298
02:34:07,101 --> 02:34:07,331
we,

6299
02:34:07,331 --> 02:34:07,700
we can't,

6300
02:34:07,700 --> 02:34:08,533
we cannot.

6301
02:34:08,750 --> 02:34:10,400
This is called the ego centric particular.

6302
02:34:10,401 --> 02:34:13,750
What about subconscious that
be still happening inside your,

6303
02:34:13,751 --> 02:34:14,600
your conscious mind.

6304
02:34:14,690 --> 02:34:19,690
So subconscious is still
somewhat conscious in some way.

6305
02:34:20,740 --> 02:34:21,071
Yes,

6306
02:34:21,071 --> 02:34:21,610
it would be happy.

6307
02:34:21,610 --> 02:34:22,180
Whatever.

6308
02:34:22,180 --> 02:34:26,170
Whatever you would perceive
would be happening in your
conscious mind would just

6309
02:34:26,171 --> 02:34:28,120
be outside of your standard awareness.

6310
02:34:28,180 --> 02:34:29,560
Now the scary thing is is that we have,

6311
02:34:29,590 --> 02:34:33,190
we make a lot of inferences and
that's where the wool comes in.

6312
02:34:33,191 --> 02:34:33,881
Everything is will,

6313
02:34:33,881 --> 02:34:37,450
will you think he thinks just
everything outside of sizes.

6314
02:34:37,480 --> 02:34:39,810
What woo sciences just as
Wu was everyone else's.

6315
02:34:39,850 --> 02:34:40,810
You keep saying that,

6316
02:34:40,811 --> 02:34:43,420
but I don't understand why you're saying
that because you haven't made a good

6317
02:34:43,421 --> 02:34:43,871
example.

6318
02:34:43,871 --> 02:34:44,081
Okay.

6319
02:34:44,081 --> 02:34:47,200
We'll only example that you said was
that they changed the way they look at

6320
02:34:47,201 --> 02:34:49,130
gravity when new
information was presented,

6321
02:34:49,131 --> 02:34:49,360
right.

6322
02:34:49,360 --> 02:34:50,141
That doesn't equal.

6323
02:34:50,141 --> 02:34:50,261
We'll,

6324
02:34:50,261 --> 02:34:51,580
we'll gravity was will.

6325
02:34:52,720 --> 02:34:53,740
It was a magical force.

6326
02:34:53,770 --> 02:34:54,220
My grandma,

6327
02:34:54,220 --> 02:34:54,710
my grandma,

6328
02:34:54,710 --> 02:34:57,690
think about gravity in terms
of people that didn't even,

6329
02:34:57,760 --> 02:34:59,860
didn't have phones,

6330
02:35:00,070 --> 02:35:01,360
they didn't have cars,

6331
02:35:01,361 --> 02:35:03,100
they didn't have paved roads.

6332
02:35:03,101 --> 02:35:03,580
I mean,

6333
02:35:03,580 --> 02:35:07,180
you're dealing with a very primitive
notion of what gravity was.

6334
02:35:07,181 --> 02:35:11,410
It was a very interesting idea that
has since been proven to be true.

6335
02:35:11,800 --> 02:35:13,360
False gravity,

6336
02:35:13,930 --> 02:35:15,010
Newtonian gravity.

6337
02:35:15,220 --> 02:35:15,640
Okay.

6338
02:35:15,640 --> 02:35:16,630
Has been proven to be false,

6339
02:35:16,631 --> 02:35:19,090
but gravity is still real,

6340
02:35:19,150 --> 02:35:19,930
right?

6341
02:35:19,930 --> 02:35:22,600
Not we're using the same word
for a completely different idea,

6342
02:35:22,630 --> 02:35:23,463
okay,

6343
02:35:23,950 --> 02:35:26,290
so Newton's gravity was magical.

6344
02:35:26,320 --> 02:35:27,340
It was an appeal to magic.

6345
02:35:27,730 --> 02:35:28,300
Okay.

6346
02:35:28,300 --> 02:35:28,931
Here it is.

6347
02:35:28,931 --> 02:35:33,580
Here is gravity is different
than Einstein's gravity
that Einstein's gravity is

6348
02:35:33,581 --> 02:35:34,570
what's been proven,

6349
02:35:35,020 --> 02:35:35,261
right?

6350
02:35:35,261 --> 02:35:38,440
We know now that light does
bend around the mass of the sun,

6351
02:35:38,441 --> 02:35:41,830
which is one of the reasons why we have
a hard time seeing asteroids that are

6352
02:35:41,831 --> 02:35:46,660
coming from behind the sun because the
mass of the sun actually Ben Space Time

6353
02:35:46,661 --> 02:35:48,760
around it to the point
where it distorts our view.

6354
02:35:49,180 --> 02:35:50,290
It's our new narrative.

6355
02:35:50,320 --> 02:35:51,153
It's not proven.

6356
02:35:51,340 --> 02:35:55,270
You can never prove a scientific
fact past the level of hypothesis.

6357
02:35:56,800 --> 02:35:57,151
It's weird.

6358
02:35:57,151 --> 02:35:58,000
I know it sounds strange,

6359
02:35:58,001 --> 02:36:00,160
but what do you mean pass
the level of hypothesis?

6360
02:36:00,161 --> 02:36:04,140
If you can prove it in
studies and tests and shit,

6361
02:36:04,150 --> 02:36:05,530
you still don't buy it.

6362
02:36:05,620 --> 02:36:07,690
You have not eliminated
every other possibility.

6363
02:36:07,750 --> 02:36:08,080
Okay,

6364
02:36:08,080 --> 02:36:09,730
so it's not the same as a logical flow.

6365
02:36:09,731 --> 02:36:10,301
How is that?

6366
02:36:10,301 --> 02:36:10,930
Whoa,

6367
02:36:10,930 --> 02:36:11,260
this is,

6368
02:36:11,260 --> 02:36:12,150
this is understood in,

6369
02:36:12,160 --> 02:36:12,391
in,

6370
02:36:12,391 --> 02:36:15,820
in like in the philosophy of science.

6371
02:36:15,910 --> 02:36:16,390
It's quick,

6372
02:36:16,390 --> 02:36:16,811
it's comfortable.

6373
02:36:16,811 --> 02:36:17,501
He accepted.

6374
02:36:17,501 --> 02:36:18,340
It's not anti science.

6375
02:36:18,341 --> 02:36:19,210
Like I'm not trying to say anything.

6376
02:36:19,240 --> 02:36:19,481
I know,

6377
02:36:19,481 --> 02:36:20,314
I know you're not.

6378
02:36:20,460 --> 02:36:24,430
You were saying that science has so
much woo and I'm not seeing the woo.

6379
02:36:24,431 --> 02:36:29,431
Part of what I'm seeing is the necessary
testing and the idea of incorporating

6380
02:36:31,721 --> 02:36:35,200
new data or heritage
changing beliefs and ideas.

6381
02:36:35,260 --> 02:36:35,460
Again,

6382
02:36:35,460 --> 02:36:35,730
this is,

6383
02:36:35,730 --> 02:36:36,800
this is quite a,

6384
02:36:36,860 --> 02:36:39,040
that's a bit of a difficult thing
to wrap your mind off it in one day,

6385
02:36:39,041 --> 02:36:41,840
but you have to think about it and
throughout time [inaudible] it comes to

6386
02:36:41,841 --> 02:36:42,674
clearer and clearer.

6387
02:36:43,150 --> 02:36:44,380
When we observe the universe,

6388
02:36:44,410 --> 02:36:46,690
all we see is patterns and
regularities found in nature.

6389
02:36:46,691 --> 02:36:47,524
That's it.

6390
02:36:47,770 --> 02:36:49,630
We don't see actual physical laws.

6391
02:36:50,290 --> 02:36:52,540
The physical laws are
bookmarks inside our mind.

6392
02:36:52,930 --> 02:36:54,820
We see the same pattern
over and over again,

6393
02:36:55,210 --> 02:36:57,100
and then we attribute a physical law,

6394
02:36:58,090 --> 02:36:59,980
but that physical art
doesn't exist out there.

6395
02:37:01,180 --> 02:37:01,720
So here's,

6396
02:37:01,720 --> 02:37:02,560
here's a great example,

6397
02:37:02,620 --> 02:37:03,100
okay?

6398
02:37:03,100 --> 02:37:03,311
Okay.

6399
02:37:03,311 --> 02:37:04,210
Let me give you a great example.

6400
02:37:05,260 --> 02:37:05,501
Okay.

6401
02:37:05,501 --> 02:37:06,670
Let's say I'm about to flip a coin.

6402
02:37:07,090 --> 02:37:07,923
Okay?

6403
02:37:08,380 --> 02:37:11,380
Now you're going to tell me it's
probably going to land on heads or tails.

6404
02:37:11,740 --> 02:37:12,573
Yeah.

6405
02:37:13,450 --> 02:37:17,120
Do you know that logically or is it
based on your history with coins?

6406
02:37:19,040 --> 02:37:21,770
I know it logically and
based on my history of corns.

6407
02:37:21,800 --> 02:37:22,250
Perfect.

6408
02:37:22,250 --> 02:37:22,821
I'm arguing.

6409
02:37:22,821 --> 02:37:23,720
You don't know it logically.

6410
02:37:24,350 --> 02:37:25,760
You only note on your past history.

6411
02:37:26,210 --> 02:37:26,481
Okay?

6412
02:37:26,481 --> 02:37:28,200
So pay attention to this.

6413
02:37:28,201 --> 02:37:28,510
This is,

6414
02:37:28,510 --> 02:37:29,360
this is a little bit weird.

6415
02:37:29,360 --> 02:37:29,910
This is what we got to.

6416
02:37:29,910 --> 02:37:31,340
We had to go slow because
it's been very weird,

6417
02:37:31,360 --> 02:37:31,790
okay?

6418
02:37:31,790 --> 02:37:32,241
It's very,

6419
02:37:32,241 --> 02:37:32,480
uh,

6420
02:37:32,480 --> 02:37:33,470
it goes against our instincts.

6421
02:37:34,070 --> 02:37:34,520
Okay?

6422
02:37:34,520 --> 02:37:35,960
Erase all your history with coins.

6423
02:37:35,961 --> 02:37:37,040
You've never seen a coin before.

6424
02:37:37,100 --> 02:37:37,760
Okay?

6425
02:37:37,760 --> 02:37:39,230
And I flip it right?

6426
02:37:39,260 --> 02:37:40,400
And now it turns into a butterfly.

6427
02:37:41,300 --> 02:37:42,350
You never seen a coin before.

6428
02:37:42,920 --> 02:37:43,680
It doesn't surprise you.

6429
02:37:43,680 --> 02:37:43,881
You're like,

6430
02:37:43,881 --> 02:37:44,570
well,

6431
02:37:44,570 --> 02:37:48,560
turn into a butterfly and I flip a
coin a hundred times in front of you a

6432
02:37:48,560 --> 02:37:49,610
hundred times it turns into a butterfly.

6433
02:37:50,360 --> 02:37:51,620
Now I'm going to flip the coin a hundred,

6434
02:37:51,660 --> 02:37:52,610
the hundred and one time.

6435
02:37:53,210 --> 02:37:53,960
You can be like,

6436
02:37:53,960 --> 02:37:55,070
I bet you it turns to a butterfly.

6437
02:37:56,090 --> 02:37:57,950
That's how we express science.

6438
02:37:58,700 --> 02:38:00,590
We see the patterns and regularities.

6439
02:38:00,890 --> 02:38:01,550
Then we achieve.

6440
02:38:01,550 --> 02:38:03,620
We predict them science.

6441
02:38:03,930 --> 02:38:04,240
This is,

6442
02:38:04,240 --> 02:38:05,073
this is a little bit,

6443
02:38:05,180 --> 02:38:05,960
this is a good way to put it.

6444
02:38:05,960 --> 02:38:07,640
Science is the faith.

6445
02:38:08,480 --> 02:38:12,650
It's faith that the future
will behave like the past.

6446
02:38:14,210 --> 02:38:19,210
Science is faith that the future
will behave like the past.

6447
02:38:19,730 --> 02:38:22,730
So now you've developed a faith that
this coin will flip into a butterfly

6448
02:38:24,320 --> 02:38:25,700
and now you can predict it.

6449
02:38:26,900 --> 02:38:31,900
Wouldn't you say that science is the use
of measurement to understand matter and

6450
02:38:34,191 --> 02:38:35,360
things around us?

6451
02:38:35,540 --> 02:38:40,540
I wouldn't say that it's using
the past to predict the future.

6452
02:38:40,820 --> 02:38:45,820
I would say that if you know that fire
melts led at a certain temperature and

6453
02:38:46,761 --> 02:38:51,530
this is provable and then you can
show this over and over again.

6454
02:38:51,830 --> 02:38:55,310
Here's what we know about fire
and reaches a certain temperature.

6455
02:38:55,490 --> 02:38:57,830
When led reaches a certain temperature,

6456
02:38:57,860 --> 02:38:58,671
it melts.

6457
02:38:58,671 --> 02:38:59,810
It changes its form.

6458
02:39:00,140 --> 02:39:05,140
Whereas if you want to do that
same task to carbon based steel,

6459
02:39:05,420 --> 02:39:09,710
it requires far greater temperatures and
then we know that there's variables in

6460
02:39:09,711 --> 02:39:10,544
matter.

6461
02:39:10,640 --> 02:39:11,241
If this is,

6462
02:39:11,241 --> 02:39:12,074
this is not,

6463
02:39:12,230 --> 02:39:14,510
this is something that
you can prove and show.

6464
02:39:14,510 --> 02:39:15,830
There's no woo to that.

6465
02:39:16,220 --> 02:39:16,520
Okay.

6466
02:39:16,520 --> 02:39:18,140
Water boils at how many degrees?

6467
02:39:18,500 --> 02:39:21,590
I think it's two 50 in
south and southeast.

6468
02:39:21,610 --> 02:39:22,640
A hundred degrees Celsius.

6469
02:39:22,790 --> 02:39:23,720
I don't know what Fahrenheit.

6470
02:39:24,170 --> 02:39:24,351
Oh,

6471
02:39:24,351 --> 02:39:27,500
you Canadians with your
wacky metric system.

6472
02:39:28,370 --> 02:39:29,500
Is that a side effect?

6473
02:39:30,380 --> 02:39:33,650
Is it a scientific fact that water
boils at a certain temperature?

6474
02:39:33,950 --> 02:39:34,700
Yes.

6475
02:39:34,700 --> 02:39:35,600
Actually no,

6476
02:39:35,750 --> 02:39:36,260
it's not.

6477
02:39:36,260 --> 02:39:37,970
They can boil water now they can.

6478
02:39:38,360 --> 02:39:41,210
Water can resist boiling
up to 200 degrees Celsius.

6479
02:39:41,510 --> 02:39:43,450
If you put in a certain atmosphere,

6480
02:39:43,730 --> 02:39:47,150
atmospheric pressure and
suspended in a certain liquid.

6481
02:39:47,420 --> 02:39:48,890
If you change the circumstance,

6482
02:39:49,340 --> 02:39:50,930
suspend water in liquids,

6483
02:39:51,050 --> 02:39:52,520
they suspended in a particular liquid.

6484
02:39:52,521 --> 02:39:52,780
It's,

6485
02:39:52,780 --> 02:39:54,440
that's not the heated or cooled,

6486
02:39:54,640 --> 02:39:54,940
right?

6487
02:39:54,940 --> 02:39:55,251
It's not.

6488
02:39:55,251 --> 02:39:56,031
It's not supposed to.

6489
02:39:56,031 --> 02:39:58,070
It doesn't affect the
temperature of the water itself.

6490
02:39:58,280 --> 02:40:00,440
And now water can boil at 200 degrees.

6491
02:40:00,560 --> 02:40:00,861
Okay,

6492
02:40:00,861 --> 02:40:02,900
so you're doing something
different to water.

6493
02:40:02,930 --> 02:40:03,530
That's the thing.

6494
02:40:03,530 --> 02:40:06,080
You're taking it outside of
the normal earth environment.

6495
02:40:06,440 --> 02:40:09,140
So the variables also
include Earth's environment.

6496
02:40:09,380 --> 02:40:10,213
Agreed.

6497
02:40:10,280 --> 02:40:13,860
But water doesn't inherently
boil at a hundred degrees.

6498
02:40:16,140 --> 02:40:16,973
It's not a fact.

6499
02:40:17,190 --> 02:40:18,420
But we believe that to be a scientific,

6500
02:40:18,490 --> 02:40:19,261
we believe that water,

6501
02:40:19,261 --> 02:40:20,071
if it gets to a hundred degrees,

6502
02:40:20,071 --> 02:40:20,521
is boiling.

6503
02:40:20,521 --> 02:40:21,360
It's going to behave this way.

6504
02:40:21,660 --> 02:40:22,171
As a matter of fact.

6505
02:40:22,171 --> 02:40:22,321
No.

6506
02:40:22,321 --> 02:40:25,800
There are many other things that that
that fact has been debunked and there's

6507
02:40:25,801 --> 02:40:27,390
countless amount of
facts like wait a minute,

6508
02:40:27,420 --> 02:40:32,100
is that the facts been debunked or is
that when you add in sufficient external

6509
02:40:32,101 --> 02:40:32,934
variables,

6510
02:40:33,060 --> 02:40:38,060
then water takes longer to boil because
of these variables playing into the

6511
02:40:39,210 --> 02:40:41,130
properties that we already
observed with water.

6512
02:40:41,160 --> 02:40:42,850
That's why whenever we
have a scientific factor,

6513
02:40:42,870 --> 02:40:46,650
might be new information
coming to to change our view,

6514
02:40:46,830 --> 02:40:47,920
change our view of this fact.

6515
02:40:47,921 --> 02:40:48,180
Right.

6516
02:40:48,180 --> 02:40:52,380
This is not necessarily new information
with this is his new additional precise,

6517
02:40:52,410 --> 02:40:53,280
more precise information.

6518
02:40:53,281 --> 02:40:54,840
But what you're talking about with water,

6519
02:40:54,841 --> 02:40:58,980
you're talking about additional
variables like that's just more science.

6520
02:40:58,980 --> 02:40:59,940
That's not woo.

6521
02:41:00,060 --> 02:41:00,331
Okay,

6522
02:41:00,331 --> 02:41:01,164
well here's some will.

6523
02:41:01,260 --> 02:41:01,561
Okay.

6524
02:41:01,561 --> 02:41:03,710
This is cause we talk
about gravity was whew,

6525
02:41:04,080 --> 02:41:04,651
okay random.

6526
02:41:04,651 --> 02:41:05,484
This was whew.

6527
02:41:05,790 --> 02:41:06,031
Okay.

6528
02:41:06,031 --> 02:41:06,330
Cause we,

6529
02:41:06,330 --> 02:41:08,520
we cannot find one instance
of actual randomness.

6530
02:41:09,840 --> 02:41:11,070
The causal lightness complete us.

6531
02:41:11,071 --> 02:41:13,140
Laplas would say there's
no randomness in the world.

6532
02:41:13,170 --> 02:41:14,070
So the randomness,

6533
02:41:14,071 --> 02:41:14,430
ideas,

6534
02:41:14,430 --> 02:41:16,460
just our inability to calculate exactly.

6535
02:41:16,461 --> 02:41:18,240
Believably difficult variables.

6536
02:41:18,300 --> 02:41:19,133
Exactly.

6537
02:41:19,230 --> 02:41:20,100
But the,

6538
02:41:20,220 --> 02:41:21,030
it's,

6539
02:41:21,030 --> 02:41:22,530
it's a projection of your ignorance.

6540
02:41:22,750 --> 02:41:24,480
If you knew it wouldn't be random.

6541
02:41:24,481 --> 02:41:25,314
So for instance,

6542
02:41:25,510 --> 02:41:25,860
um,

6543
02:41:25,860 --> 02:41:26,940
I can't remember who coined the term,

6544
02:41:26,941 --> 02:41:30,810
but they say the man who says the tallest
mountain I've ever seen is the tallest

6545
02:41:30,811 --> 02:41:33,150
mountain he's making himself.

6546
02:41:33,151 --> 02:41:33,984
The measure of truth.

6547
02:41:34,020 --> 02:41:34,920
I measure truth.

6548
02:41:35,670 --> 02:41:37,170
If you take that perspective,

6549
02:41:37,230 --> 02:41:38,230
you're the center of truth.

6550
02:41:38,231 --> 02:41:39,064
I am truth.

6551
02:41:39,090 --> 02:41:40,590
There's nothing outside of me that's true.

6552
02:41:41,070 --> 02:41:42,300
Then you see randomness everywhere.

6553
02:41:42,630 --> 02:41:43,021
However,

6554
02:41:43,021 --> 02:41:44,370
if you believe in correspondence theory,

6555
02:41:44,371 --> 02:41:46,200
that truth is independent of me and you,

6556
02:41:46,320 --> 02:41:47,640
which I think most of us will agree,

6557
02:41:48,480 --> 02:41:51,870
then random has doesn't exist in that
context because randomness only depends on

6558
02:41:51,871 --> 02:41:54,540
you and when things are true
outside of your beliefs,

6559
02:41:54,780 --> 02:41:55,260
right?

6560
02:41:55,260 --> 02:41:57,030
Let's take another classic wool wool term.

6561
02:41:58,340 --> 02:41:58,541
And yeah,

6562
02:41:58,541 --> 02:41:59,490
this is a very advanced philosophy.

6563
02:41:59,491 --> 02:42:00,360
I know it sounds crazy,

6564
02:42:00,361 --> 02:42:00,601
okay?

6565
02:42:00,601 --> 02:42:01,350
But this is,

6566
02:42:01,350 --> 02:42:01,710
this is,

6567
02:42:01,710 --> 02:42:03,630
this is what the greatest
thinkers in history,

6568
02:42:03,870 --> 02:42:04,703
in a report,

6569
02:42:04,800 --> 02:42:04,951
okay?

6570
02:42:04,951 --> 02:42:06,150
With what they've written down,

6571
02:42:06,420 --> 02:42:07,253
okay?

6572
02:42:07,830 --> 02:42:08,161
Okay.

6573
02:42:08,161 --> 02:42:08,821
See this,

6574
02:42:08,821 --> 02:42:09,360
uh,

6575
02:42:09,360 --> 02:42:10,320
you see a knife guy.

6576
02:42:10,410 --> 02:42:12,270
Let's look at Aristotle's
theory of knives.

6577
02:42:12,280 --> 02:42:12,430
Okay?

6578
02:42:12,430 --> 02:42:12,680
Says,

6579
02:42:12,680 --> 02:42:12,920
look,

6580
02:42:12,920 --> 02:42:13,470
look at this knife.

6581
02:42:13,470 --> 02:42:14,490
I show you a plastic knife.

6582
02:42:14,491 --> 02:42:15,360
I show you a wooden knife.

6583
02:42:15,361 --> 02:42:16,470
I show you a metal knife,

6584
02:42:16,920 --> 02:42:19,050
I show you five different
knives and you're like,

6585
02:42:19,051 --> 02:42:19,830
they're all knives.

6586
02:42:19,830 --> 02:42:20,663
All of them are knives.

6587
02:42:20,760 --> 02:42:22,050
You point to them and say their knives.

6588
02:42:23,460 --> 02:42:24,181
Aristotle says,

6589
02:42:24,181 --> 02:42:24,361
look,

6590
02:42:24,361 --> 02:42:26,610
they all share in one something,

6591
02:42:26,670 --> 02:42:29,100
let's call it the essence
that makes them all knives.

6592
02:42:30,390 --> 02:42:31,223
Would you agree?

6593
02:42:31,650 --> 02:42:33,720
The form they all share,

6594
02:42:33,780 --> 02:42:35,020
they fight draw knife on a paper,

6595
02:42:35,021 --> 02:42:35,970
but like he just drew a knife.

6596
02:42:36,270 --> 02:42:37,500
That knife on the paper,

6597
02:42:37,770 --> 02:42:39,870
share something with
a knife made of steel.

6598
02:42:39,871 --> 02:42:42,450
They'll knife made of plastic
or the knife made of wood.

6599
02:42:42,480 --> 02:42:43,020
The form.

6600
02:42:43,020 --> 02:42:44,220
There's something about it.

6601
02:42:44,280 --> 02:42:45,600
We call it the essence in philosophy.

6602
02:42:45,630 --> 02:42:46,380
Okay.

6603
02:42:46,380 --> 02:42:49,860
The four might be confused with what
Plato says split or how the whole thing

6604
02:42:49,861 --> 02:42:50,521
about forms,

6605
02:42:50,521 --> 02:42:52,260
but let's call it for now essence.

6606
02:42:52,350 --> 02:42:53,183
Okay.

6607
02:42:53,520 --> 02:42:54,630
If you change the essence,

6608
02:42:54,660 --> 02:42:55,493
you change the thing.

6609
02:42:55,980 --> 02:42:57,210
So if I take that piece of that,

6610
02:42:57,211 --> 02:43:00,100
if I take that plastic
a knife and I melt it,

6611
02:43:00,110 --> 02:43:01,260
you realize it's not a knife anymore.

6612
02:43:01,750 --> 02:43:02,011
Why?

6613
02:43:02,011 --> 02:43:02,670
What did I do?

6614
02:43:02,670 --> 02:43:03,990
You change that thing about it.

6615
02:43:05,190 --> 02:43:07,770
That essence right now,

6616
02:43:07,800 --> 02:43:08,491
that essence,

6617
02:43:08,491 --> 02:43:11,530
does it exist out there in the world
or is it only in your head made it up?

6618
02:43:13,210 --> 02:43:13,511
Well,

6619
02:43:13,511 --> 02:43:14,620
by calling it assence,

6620
02:43:14,621 --> 02:43:15,760
you're confusing me,

6621
02:43:15,850 --> 02:43:17,290
so I would call it the form,

6622
02:43:17,770 --> 02:43:18,603
the form of it.

6623
02:43:18,740 --> 02:43:23,080
It sort of exists in culture that exists
in our understanding of these objects

6624
02:43:23,150 --> 02:43:24,250
and useful shapes.

6625
02:43:24,310 --> 02:43:24,731
It's you,

6626
02:43:24,731 --> 02:43:25,480
it's your,

6627
02:43:25,480 --> 02:43:26,620
your idea of,

6628
02:43:26,680 --> 02:43:28,990
of knife conforms to that knife out there.

6629
02:43:29,260 --> 02:43:30,400
Where's that knife out here?

6630
02:43:30,520 --> 02:43:31,031
That's a great,

6631
02:43:31,031 --> 02:43:31,300
yeah.

6632
02:43:31,300 --> 02:43:31,810
Bring it out.

6633
02:43:31,810 --> 02:43:32,520
You can see it.

6634
02:43:32,520 --> 02:43:32,860
Great.

6635
02:43:32,860 --> 02:43:34,000
It's obviously a knife.

6636
02:43:34,030 --> 02:43:34,690
Yes.

6637
02:43:34,690 --> 02:43:35,440
Right.

6638
02:43:35,440 --> 02:43:37,060
You recognize it or recognize it.

6639
02:43:37,090 --> 02:43:37,923
That's a knife.

6640
02:43:38,050 --> 02:43:38,231
Yeah.

6641
02:43:38,231 --> 02:43:39,064
I totally agree.

6642
02:43:39,230 --> 02:43:39,800
Mike.

6643
02:43:39,800 --> 02:43:40,690
Model of knife.

6644
02:43:41,200 --> 02:43:41,800
Yeah.

6645
02:43:41,800 --> 02:43:43,570
My model of knife that fits my model,

6646
02:43:44,840 --> 02:43:46,690
but there's some weird
looking knives out there too.

6647
02:43:46,720 --> 02:43:47,553
Sure.

6648
02:43:47,580 --> 02:43:49,090
And there might be a knife
where we don't agree.

6649
02:43:49,150 --> 02:43:50,320
That's the night you think it's a knife.

6650
02:43:50,321 --> 02:43:50,741
I don't agree.

6651
02:43:50,741 --> 02:43:50,920
That's,

6652
02:43:50,920 --> 02:43:51,730
I think that's a sword.

6653
02:43:51,730 --> 02:43:52,780
I'd reached a level of sorts.

6654
02:43:52,810 --> 02:43:53,643
Right.

6655
02:43:54,210 --> 02:43:57,310
You might have a different that that's
a great evidence that something in our

6656
02:43:57,311 --> 02:43:59,140
minds that actually objective.

6657
02:43:59,170 --> 02:43:59,411
Right,

6658
02:43:59,411 --> 02:43:59,591
right,

6659
02:43:59,591 --> 02:43:59,860
right.

6660
02:43:59,860 --> 02:44:01,870
They get to the certain
length and subjective.

6661
02:44:02,530 --> 02:44:03,170
It's subjective.

6662
02:44:03,170 --> 02:44:03,670
Right?

6663
02:44:03,670 --> 02:44:04,503
Okay.

6664
02:44:04,690 --> 02:44:05,351
Let's look up matter,

6665
02:44:05,351 --> 02:44:06,820
no matter.

6666
02:44:07,150 --> 02:44:07,360
Okay.

6667
02:44:07,360 --> 02:44:08,440
It's an inference of the mind.

6668
02:44:08,441 --> 02:44:09,220
Just like the,

6669
02:44:09,220 --> 02:44:10,660
the knife is an inference of the mind

6670
02:44:12,190 --> 02:44:16,870
in terms of subatomic particles
and atoms and you see this cup,

6671
02:44:17,770 --> 02:44:18,640
you see this bottle?

6672
02:44:18,700 --> 02:44:19,210
Yes.

6673
02:44:19,210 --> 02:44:20,020
You see this clock?

6674
02:44:20,020 --> 02:44:20,853
Yes.

6675
02:44:20,950 --> 02:44:21,820
You made an inference.

6676
02:44:21,821 --> 02:44:22,930
They all share one thing.

6677
02:44:22,931 --> 02:44:23,620
What did they share?

6678
02:44:23,620 --> 02:44:24,610
All of them share one thing.

6679
02:44:24,611 --> 02:44:25,570
What is that thing they share?

6680
02:44:25,930 --> 02:44:27,280
They share this thing called matter,

6681
02:44:28,880 --> 02:44:29,400
but that's,

6682
02:44:29,400 --> 02:44:30,191
that was an inference.

6683
02:44:30,191 --> 02:44:34,810
Just like we inferred the essence of a
knife matter has never been observed in

6684
02:44:34,811 --> 02:44:35,644
nature.

6685
02:44:35,770 --> 02:44:38,080
Matter is a byproduct of our mind.

6686
02:44:39,610 --> 02:44:41,020
So when you see a tree,

6687
02:44:41,770 --> 02:44:42,940
you're not seeing matter.

6688
02:44:43,240 --> 02:44:44,073
There's no matter.

6689
02:44:44,110 --> 02:44:44,530
There's only,

6690
02:44:44,530 --> 02:44:46,240
not that I'm inferring matter,

6691
02:44:46,510 --> 02:44:47,650
I'm observing an image,

6692
02:44:47,790 --> 02:44:48,130
right?

6693
02:44:48,130 --> 02:44:49,390
But I'm insuring the matter.

6694
02:44:49,810 --> 02:44:50,301
The matter is,

6695
02:44:50,301 --> 02:44:51,430
it is a mental construct.

6696
02:44:52,330 --> 02:44:57,330
Is it a mental construct or is it our
inability to see things smaller than what

6697
02:44:59,231 --> 02:45:01,090
is necessary for our survival?

6698
02:45:01,180 --> 02:45:02,860
Like we can't see Adam's,

6699
02:45:02,861 --> 02:45:04,570
we can't see subatomic particles.

6700
02:45:04,571 --> 02:45:06,580
We can't see them with the naked eye,

6701
02:45:06,790 --> 02:45:10,480
but we understand through
science that they exist.

6702
02:45:10,900 --> 02:45:12,460
How do you understand that they exist?

6703
02:45:12,550 --> 02:45:15,250
Are you seeing that matter exists
out there independently of your mind?

6704
02:45:17,080 --> 02:45:20,410
Is matter objective or is it
dependent on your mind to exist?

6705
02:45:21,040 --> 02:45:23,110
It's not dependent on your mind to exist.

6706
02:45:23,111 --> 02:45:25,670
It's just dependent upon
your mind to observe your,

6707
02:45:25,710 --> 02:45:28,720
you need your mind to be
able to observe matter.

6708
02:45:29,320 --> 02:45:29,591
Okay.

6709
02:45:29,591 --> 02:45:31,210
So if you didn't exist,

6710
02:45:31,211 --> 02:45:32,800
do you think this table would exist?

6711
02:45:33,040 --> 02:45:33,311
That,

6712
02:45:33,311 --> 02:45:34,144
I dunno.

6713
02:45:34,240 --> 02:45:34,810
Right?

6714
02:45:34,810 --> 02:45:36,070
But what would you guess?

6715
02:45:36,670 --> 02:45:39,610
I would guess that all I know if
I'm going to use outcomes razor,

6716
02:45:39,611 --> 02:45:39,791
you know,

6717
02:45:39,791 --> 02:45:40,390
if you've heard of aqua,

6718
02:45:40,390 --> 02:45:42,280
if I'm going to go to the
extreme with Ockham's razor,

6719
02:45:43,570 --> 02:45:45,610
I'm just going to believe what I observe.

6720
02:45:45,940 --> 02:45:46,370
Okay.

6721
02:45:46,370 --> 02:45:47,380
Kill all the wool.

6722
02:45:47,500 --> 02:45:48,160
Kill it all.

6723
02:45:48,160 --> 02:45:49,510
You've had loved one die,

6724
02:45:49,660 --> 02:45:49,960
right?

6725
02:45:49,960 --> 02:45:50,290
Yeah.

6726
02:45:50,290 --> 02:45:50,891
Everyone has,

6727
02:45:50,891 --> 02:45:51,670
right?

6728
02:45:51,670 --> 02:45:52,330
Um,

6729
02:45:52,330 --> 02:45:53,920
do you assume that when they die,

6730
02:45:53,921 --> 02:45:55,900
the universe is still the universe?

6731
02:45:56,500 --> 02:45:57,700
What do you mean still the universe?

6732
02:45:57,701 --> 02:46:00,340
It's like the world is the way they are.

6733
02:46:00,520 --> 02:46:00,930
I mean,

6734
02:46:00,930 --> 02:46:01,721
the way it is,

6735
02:46:01,721 --> 02:46:05,230
there's trees and grass and
dirt and this person dies.

6736
02:46:05,800 --> 02:46:07,030
The trees and grass,

6737
02:46:07,031 --> 02:46:07,391
dirt,

6738
02:46:07,391 --> 02:46:07,991
they don't change.

6739
02:46:07,991 --> 02:46:08,890
They're still the same thing.

6740
02:46:10,610 --> 02:46:12,800
What do you mean the nature
of the tree would change it?

6741
02:46:12,830 --> 02:46:13,191
No,

6742
02:46:13,191 --> 02:46:18,050
I'm saying if you love someone and you
know this person and they are no longer

6743
02:46:18,051 --> 02:46:18,884
with us,

6744
02:46:19,310 --> 02:46:22,160
all the things around you like
this coughing up and this knife,

6745
02:46:22,190 --> 02:46:22,661
they stayed,

6746
02:46:22,661 --> 02:46:23,540
remained the same.

6747
02:46:23,960 --> 02:46:24,793
They don't change,

6748
02:46:25,010 --> 02:46:25,550
they don't change.

6749
02:46:25,550 --> 02:46:29,210
Why would you assume that it would be
any different for yourself if you weren't

6750
02:46:29,211 --> 02:46:29,900
here?

6751
02:46:29,900 --> 02:46:33,440
Why would you think that this table
would not exist for the microphone?

6752
02:46:33,441 --> 02:46:35,420
Would not say that's a great argument.

6753
02:46:35,421 --> 02:46:36,254
I'm not saying that it wouldn't it.

6754
02:46:36,260 --> 02:46:38,000
That's this is what we
call hard objectivity.

6755
02:46:38,690 --> 02:46:39,740
Something that's hard.

6756
02:46:39,741 --> 02:46:42,710
Objectivity exists without
any human mind and exist.

6757
02:46:42,711 --> 02:46:44,150
If all human minds were dead,

6758
02:46:44,840 --> 02:46:48,140
whatever exists still is what we
would call philosophers called hard

6759
02:46:48,141 --> 02:46:48,974
objectivity.

6760
02:46:49,640 --> 02:46:50,880
Now we have objectives it.

6761
02:46:51,050 --> 02:46:51,883
So for instance,

6762
02:46:52,280 --> 02:46:53,930
let's look at George Berkeley's example.

6763
02:46:53,931 --> 02:46:54,890
Is that such a great question?

6764
02:46:55,280 --> 02:46:56,060
Look at a triangle.

6765
02:46:56,060 --> 02:46:56,570
Okay.

6766
02:46:56,570 --> 02:46:57,110
Okay.

6767
02:46:57,110 --> 02:46:58,610
Picture a blue triangle.

6768
02:46:59,090 --> 02:46:59,540
Okay.

6769
02:46:59,540 --> 02:47:00,373
Picture a green one.

6770
02:47:00,680 --> 02:47:01,491
Picture a black one.

6771
02:47:01,491 --> 02:47:02,324
Picture a white one.

6772
02:47:02,660 --> 02:47:05,000
Can you picture one with
no subjective elements?

6773
02:47:05,001 --> 02:47:06,260
Meaning because color is subjective,

6774
02:47:06,261 --> 02:47:07,094
right?

6775
02:47:07,850 --> 02:47:09,710
Color is a construct of the mind.

6776
02:47:09,711 --> 02:47:11,150
So if I was colorblind,

6777
02:47:11,180 --> 02:47:13,160
this shirt would be a different
color to me than it is to you.

6778
02:47:13,620 --> 02:47:13,971
However,

6779
02:47:13,971 --> 02:47:15,290
there would still be one shirt.

6780
02:47:15,890 --> 02:47:17,570
It would be objective to a certain degree.

6781
02:47:17,600 --> 02:47:18,433
Okay,

6782
02:47:18,470 --> 02:47:19,880
so triangle has three,

6783
02:47:20,150 --> 02:47:20,983
three sides,

6784
02:47:21,170 --> 02:47:22,003
three corners.

6785
02:47:22,170 --> 02:47:24,090
It adds up to 180 degrees.

6786
02:47:24,210 --> 02:47:25,380
We all agree it.

6787
02:47:25,381 --> 02:47:26,214
Whether you're colorblind,

6788
02:47:26,310 --> 02:47:27,030
it doesn't matter,

6789
02:47:27,030 --> 02:47:27,400
right?

6790
02:47:27,400 --> 02:47:29,820
There is no subject of element
to how many points does it have?

6791
02:47:30,390 --> 02:47:32,700
Nobody's going to come in and say to me,

6792
02:47:32,701 --> 02:47:33,620
triangles have three,

6793
02:47:33,660 --> 02:47:34,380
four sites.

6794
02:47:34,380 --> 02:47:34,980
Right?

6795
02:47:34,980 --> 02:47:35,371
You'd be like,

6796
02:47:35,371 --> 02:47:36,570
that's not a triangle.

6797
02:47:37,020 --> 02:47:38,100
There's not three angles to that.

6798
02:47:38,610 --> 02:47:39,121
You've not.

6799
02:47:39,121 --> 02:47:41,430
You've gone past it a
little cool understanding.

6800
02:47:42,060 --> 02:47:42,271
Okay,

6801
02:47:42,271 --> 02:47:44,160
so can you,

6802
02:47:44,310 --> 02:47:45,121
George Berkeley says,

6803
02:47:45,121 --> 02:47:48,420
can you picture a triangle
without any subjective element,

6804
02:47:48,510 --> 02:47:49,350
without any color?

6805
02:47:49,500 --> 02:47:50,280
Let's call it color.

6806
02:47:50,280 --> 02:47:51,113
To make it really simple,

6807
02:47:51,150 --> 02:47:51,480
really,

6808
02:47:51,480 --> 02:47:52,313
really obvious.

6809
02:47:52,800 --> 02:47:55,230
Can you picture a triangle
without any color?

6810
02:47:55,620 --> 02:47:59,190
You would have to have it in contrast
to something so that you could see it.

6811
02:47:59,540 --> 02:48:02,120
Like if you had a say,

6812
02:48:02,121 --> 02:48:03,770
if you had a purple curtain,

6813
02:48:03,830 --> 02:48:05,120
like what we have behind us,

6814
02:48:05,570 --> 02:48:07,520
and out of that Purple Carton,

6815
02:48:07,550 --> 02:48:08,780
we cut a triangle.

6816
02:48:09,800 --> 02:48:11,270
Even if there was no color,

6817
02:48:11,690 --> 02:48:12,950
if it was just clear,

6818
02:48:13,410 --> 02:48:14,270
you would be able to see.

6819
02:48:14,271 --> 02:48:16,400
You'd be able to differentiate
between that shape,

6820
02:48:16,460 --> 02:48:21,110
but she needed that purple curtain to
differentiate so we cannot have it without

6821
02:48:21,230 --> 02:48:22,160
subjective element.

6822
02:48:22,310 --> 02:48:23,240
This was Berkeley's point.

6823
02:48:23,270 --> 02:48:24,103
Exactly what you said.

6824
02:48:24,110 --> 02:48:24,680
I see what you're saying.

6825
02:48:24,680 --> 02:48:25,513
Beautiful.

6826
02:48:25,730 --> 02:48:29,670
Every objective thing we've
observed in the universe has,

6827
02:48:29,671 --> 02:48:31,430
this is made up of subjective elements.

6828
02:48:31,930 --> 02:48:33,790
Even when you draw the
number one on a blackboard,

6829
02:48:34,150 --> 02:48:37,570
it has to be a color as to be
something that has to be a contrast.

6830
02:48:37,571 --> 02:48:37,981
Like you said,

6831
02:48:37,981 --> 02:48:38,520
it's beautiful.

6832
02:48:38,520 --> 02:48:39,353
He said it beautifully.

6833
02:48:41,560 --> 02:48:44,710
All our objective elements
or mental constructs,

6834
02:48:45,670 --> 02:48:46,400
three sides.

6835
02:48:46,400 --> 02:48:48,250
The idea of side is a mental construct.

6836
02:48:48,550 --> 02:48:50,770
The idea of a point is a mental construct.

6837
02:48:50,771 --> 02:48:53,290
The idea of 180 degrees is mathematical.

6838
02:48:53,291 --> 02:48:54,910
It's happening in your mind somewhere.

6839
02:48:55,810 --> 02:48:56,830
They're being observed.

6840
02:48:57,040 --> 02:49:02,040
You can draw it and I can see it and I
can repeat it and you can teach it to me

6841
02:49:02,051 --> 02:49:04,450
and I can teach it to
someone else like these are,

6842
02:49:04,480 --> 02:49:06,010
they may be mental constructs,

6843
02:49:06,011 --> 02:49:08,130
but they're provable mental that

6844
02:49:08,130 --> 02:49:08,963
are repeatable.

6845
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:09,833
So there we were.

6846
02:49:09,890 --> 02:49:11,220
Sharing agreement is a real thing.

6847
02:49:11,370 --> 02:49:15,570
We're in agreement that mathematic
is a mental construct and it's true.

6848
02:49:15,870 --> 02:49:17,400
It's definitely by the finish and truth.

6849
02:49:17,430 --> 02:49:19,850
So it was both a mental
construct and trust,

6850
02:49:19,920 --> 02:49:22,770
but it's not outside
out there in the world.

6851
02:49:22,800 --> 02:49:23,633
It's within.

6852
02:49:24,660 --> 02:49:27,420
But if you make a triangle on the ground,

6853
02:49:27,870 --> 02:49:28,890
it's in the world.

6854
02:49:30,210 --> 02:49:33,450
The numbers are in your head and the
subjective element is in the world.

6855
02:49:34,320 --> 02:49:35,310
There's a two way street.

6856
02:49:36,390 --> 02:49:39,030
The subjective element is in the world,

6857
02:49:39,180 --> 02:49:40,290
but it's a triangle.

6858
02:49:40,610 --> 02:49:40,910
So,

6859
02:49:40,910 --> 02:49:42,060
so how's it in your head?

6860
02:49:43,050 --> 02:49:43,890
Because you,

6861
02:49:43,891 --> 02:49:45,030
when you look at a triangle,

6862
02:49:47,190 --> 02:49:48,510
the subjective elements,

6863
02:49:49,770 --> 02:49:51,270
when you observe them in your mind,

6864
02:49:51,300 --> 02:49:55,290
your mind points out different
objective elements of that triangle.

6865
02:49:55,830 --> 02:49:57,000
But it's dependent on your mind.

6866
02:49:57,030 --> 02:49:58,050
By that argument,

6867
02:49:58,080 --> 02:50:00,330
the entire universe is
dependent on your mind.

6868
02:50:00,360 --> 02:50:01,380
Absolutely no doubt about it.

6869
02:50:01,480 --> 02:50:02,820
If we're going to use OCKHAM's razor,

6870
02:50:02,880 --> 02:50:03,390
yes,

6871
02:50:03,390 --> 02:50:04,440
but not everyday language.

6872
02:50:04,470 --> 02:50:05,160
We use an outcomes.

6873
02:50:05,160 --> 02:50:05,971
Let's take away everything.

6874
02:50:05,971 --> 02:50:07,650
We're not sure of
everything that has a doubt.

6875
02:50:07,651 --> 02:50:08,310
Get rid of it.

6876
02:50:08,310 --> 02:50:09,143
Okay?

6877
02:50:09,360 --> 02:50:11,440
Get rid of everything with a sliver
of the La you ever heard or read.

6878
02:50:11,450 --> 02:50:14,460
The problem and they can't matter
itself as a sliver of doubt.

6879
02:50:14,610 --> 02:50:15,210
Absolutely.

6880
02:50:15,210 --> 02:50:15,511
Well,

6881
02:50:15,511 --> 02:50:19,980
when you have subatomic particles that
you know they exist in two different

6882
02:50:19,981 --> 02:50:21,270
states simultaneously.

6883
02:50:21,271 --> 02:50:25,560
They're both spinning and still there
in superstates Berkeley would tell you

6884
02:50:25,561 --> 02:50:27,870
those are images of subatomic particles.

6885
02:50:27,900 --> 02:50:28,510
They're not mum.

6886
02:50:28,510 --> 02:50:32,010
Some of sub atomic particles
independent of your mind.

6887
02:50:32,640 --> 02:50:33,360
Well,

6888
02:50:33,360 --> 02:50:36,580
I had a conversation with
Sean Carroll about it.

6889
02:50:36,581 --> 02:50:38,460
It was a physicist and
he made it familiar,

6890
02:50:38,461 --> 02:50:40,980
even more muddy to me.

6891
02:50:41,520 --> 02:50:42,161
I thought I,

6892
02:50:42,161 --> 02:50:45,060
I thought it was crazy before I talked
to him and then when I talked to him,

6893
02:50:45,540 --> 02:50:46,373
he's brilliant,

6894
02:50:46,380 --> 02:50:47,213
he's brilliant.

6895
02:50:47,220 --> 02:50:52,220
He's essentially saying that subatomic
particles don't blink in and out of

6896
02:50:52,561 --> 02:50:53,400
existence.

6897
02:50:53,940 --> 02:50:54,990
It's just we,

6898
02:50:55,590 --> 02:51:00,590
it's the way we're looking at them and
that they exist in this just bizarre

6899
02:51:00,871 --> 02:51:01,704
state,

6900
02:51:01,830 --> 02:51:05,610
but they exist in this state in a way
that it's very difficult for us to use

6901
02:51:05,611 --> 02:51:07,200
normal language to sort of explain.

6902
02:51:07,201 --> 02:51:07,740
Exactly.

6903
02:51:07,740 --> 02:51:08,041
That's,

6904
02:51:08,041 --> 02:51:08,821
that's the true issue.

6905
02:51:08,821 --> 02:51:09,910
But you know what a,

6906
02:51:09,970 --> 02:51:10,801
I might have fucked.

6907
02:51:10,801 --> 02:51:13,560
He's probably listening to this
was like you fucking dummy.

6908
02:51:14,040 --> 02:51:14,401
You know,

6909
02:51:14,401 --> 02:51:15,330
and what I said again,

6910
02:51:15,810 --> 02:51:16,560
you know what is,

6911
02:51:16,560 --> 02:51:18,390
what a great w one great conversation.

6912
02:51:18,391 --> 02:51:20,820
I heard a conversation between
Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris,

6913
02:51:21,550 --> 02:51:21,981
all that,

6914
02:51:21,981 --> 02:51:23,190
the conversation about truth.

6915
02:51:23,280 --> 02:51:23,850
I loved it.

6916
02:51:23,850 --> 02:51:24,071
Oh,

6917
02:51:24,071 --> 02:51:25,020
that drove me crazy.

6918
02:51:25,080 --> 02:51:26,190
I think we could do better though.

6919
02:51:26,520 --> 02:51:26,881
Yes.

6920
02:51:26,881 --> 02:51:29,160
I think they could have done
better to the moderator.

6921
02:51:29,190 --> 02:51:29,431
Yes,

6922
02:51:29,431 --> 02:51:29,910
exactly.

6923
02:51:29,910 --> 02:51:30,743
Exactly.

6924
02:51:30,920 --> 02:51:32,850
Do you need to get to know
each other personally first?

6925
02:51:33,120 --> 02:51:33,781
They never met,

6926
02:51:33,781 --> 02:51:34,350
by the way.

6927
02:51:34,350 --> 02:51:34,950
That's,

6928
02:51:34,950 --> 02:51:36,390
that's fireworks,

6929
02:51:36,391 --> 02:51:37,224
right?

6930
02:51:38,250 --> 02:51:39,420
That was such a great conversation.

6931
02:51:39,421 --> 02:51:40,440
But here's my question.

6932
02:51:41,190 --> 02:51:44,190
What's the difference
between knowledge and belief?

6933
02:51:44,560 --> 02:51:45,990
Because a lot of what we
said is kind of muddy.

6934
02:51:45,991 --> 02:51:46,141
Okay,

6935
02:51:46,141 --> 02:51:46,950
let's make it suit.

6936
02:51:46,950 --> 02:51:47,371
Let's make,

6937
02:51:47,371 --> 02:51:49,560
let's make the water's crystal
clear as much as possible.

6938
02:51:49,680 --> 02:51:50,513
Okay.

6939
02:51:51,090 --> 02:51:54,300
What is the difference
between knowledge and belief?

6940
02:51:54,690 --> 02:51:55,140
Well,

6941
02:51:55,140 --> 02:51:58,110
the belief that the gremlins
are pulling down on people,

6942
02:51:58,111 --> 02:51:59,550
which is why we have gravity.

6943
02:51:59,730 --> 02:52:00,990
That would be a belief.

6944
02:52:01,050 --> 02:52:01,291
No,

6945
02:52:01,291 --> 02:52:02,124
they're both beliefs.

6946
02:52:02,220 --> 02:52:02,700
Well,

6947
02:52:02,700 --> 02:52:03,040
Dad,

6948
02:52:03,040 --> 02:52:03,960
gravity's not knowledge.

6949
02:52:03,990 --> 02:52:04,823
It's a belief.

6950
02:52:05,050 --> 02:52:05,391
Okay,

6951
02:52:05,391 --> 02:52:06,790
but we're talking about Graham ones.

6952
02:52:07,140 --> 02:52:10,420
I was gonna say that's knowledge
or that that's a belief.

6953
02:52:10,421 --> 02:52:11,200
Belief,

6954
02:52:11,200 --> 02:52:12,070
knowledges.

6955
02:52:12,071 --> 02:52:13,210
If I throw water on your,

6956
02:52:13,211 --> 02:52:14,044
you get wet.

6957
02:52:14,690 --> 02:52:15,250
Hmm.

6958
02:52:15,250 --> 02:52:17,290
How would say that's belief to believe?

6959
02:52:17,320 --> 02:52:17,770
Yes.

6960
02:52:17,770 --> 02:52:22,060
So maybe one day I throw water on you
and you to show me that you're Jesus and

6961
02:52:22,061 --> 02:52:24,100
the water just goes right
through you and it does.

6962
02:52:24,100 --> 02:52:25,450
The reason why you believe of water,

6963
02:52:25,451 --> 02:52:27,940
it would make me wet is because
it happened in the past.

6964
02:52:28,300 --> 02:52:30,310
Now you think that the future is
going to behave like the past.

6965
02:52:30,311 --> 02:52:33,160
Just like Aristotle saw the sun go around
the earth and he thought that this is

6966
02:52:33,161 --> 02:52:33,880
going to happen everyday.

6967
02:52:33,880 --> 02:52:34,960
He didn't understand.

6968
02:52:34,990 --> 02:52:35,430
I understand.

6969
02:52:35,430 --> 02:52:36,210
It's optical illusion.

6970
02:52:36,210 --> 02:52:36,520
Let me,

6971
02:52:36,520 --> 02:52:36,990
let me go.

6972
02:52:36,990 --> 02:52:38,320
Let me give you a better is though.

6973
02:52:38,321 --> 02:52:39,760
It's each to throw it out.

6974
02:52:39,761 --> 02:52:40,480
She get wet.

6975
02:52:40,480 --> 02:52:41,530
All flamingos are pink.

6976
02:52:41,920 --> 02:52:42,610
They're not.

6977
02:52:42,610 --> 02:52:43,443
They're not.

6978
02:52:43,480 --> 02:52:44,500
We didn't know that all the time.

6979
02:52:44,501 --> 02:52:45,010
Did we?

6980
02:52:45,010 --> 02:52:45,910
Then we went to Australia.

6981
02:52:45,911 --> 02:52:47,170
They don't have the same food source.

6982
02:52:47,171 --> 02:52:48,700
They don't have the same food
sorts of their black here.

6983
02:52:48,701 --> 02:52:49,534
They're white here.

6984
02:52:49,700 --> 02:52:50,710
They have a different food source.

6985
02:52:50,860 --> 02:52:52,300
Flamingos are not inherently pink.

6986
02:52:53,070 --> 02:52:56,470
It's a scientific fact
can always be overturned.

6987
02:52:57,400 --> 02:52:57,630
Never.

6988
02:52:57,630 --> 02:52:58,540
Look at this.

6989
02:52:58,541 --> 02:52:59,920
He threw a water and didn't get wet.

6990
02:53:00,300 --> 02:53:00,610
Yeah,

6991
02:53:00,610 --> 02:53:03,070
but this is not just because it's a,

6992
02:53:03,130 --> 02:53:04,630
it's a certain coding.

6993
02:53:04,730 --> 02:53:05,350
Right.

6994
02:53:05,350 --> 02:53:06,000
I got you.

6995
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:07,560
But if he's got that over his body,

6996
02:53:07,590 --> 02:53:08,590
not going to be able to breathe.

6997
02:53:08,770 --> 02:53:09,041
Okay.

6998
02:53:09,041 --> 02:53:09,874
How about this?

6999
02:53:10,360 --> 02:53:11,740
You've never seen fire before.

7000
02:53:12,040 --> 02:53:14,380
You've never seen five K and human being.

7001
02:53:14,410 --> 02:53:16,960
You've been being warmed by
electric blankets your entire life.

7002
02:53:16,990 --> 02:53:17,440
Okay.

7003
02:53:17,440 --> 02:53:19,630
Then you see a flame and you don't know.

7004
02:53:19,690 --> 02:53:22,300
Can you know that that flame is going
to burn you if you touch it logically or

7005
02:53:22,301 --> 02:53:23,740
is it only via experience?

7006
02:53:23,770 --> 02:53:24,603
Through history,

7007
02:53:24,790 --> 02:53:26,650
developing a history or
relationship with fire.

7008
02:53:26,890 --> 02:53:28,780
A bird you once at burns you twice.

7009
02:53:28,781 --> 02:53:29,021
You're like,

7010
02:53:29,021 --> 02:53:29,430
Hey,

7011
02:53:29,430 --> 02:53:31,270
but I think the future is
going to behave like the past.

7012
02:53:31,310 --> 02:53:31,931
I'm not gonna touch that.

7013
02:53:31,931 --> 02:53:36,310
Folk who know that fire burns you and
they've never been burned by fire because

7014
02:53:36,311 --> 02:53:40,510
they went to school and they learn from
people who explain the properties of

7015
02:53:40,511 --> 02:53:41,051
fire,

7016
02:53:41,051 --> 02:53:41,920
what it is,

7017
02:53:42,040 --> 02:53:43,060
how it works,

7018
02:53:43,180 --> 02:53:44,680
what temperature it operates on,

7019
02:53:44,681 --> 02:53:47,700
how it's different depending upon
the color of it or what's burning.

7020
02:53:47,860 --> 02:53:48,640
Borrowed history,

7021
02:53:48,640 --> 02:53:49,420
borrowed history.

7022
02:53:49,420 --> 02:53:50,253
It's still history.

7023
02:53:50,800 --> 02:53:51,670
Borrowed history.

7024
02:53:51,671 --> 02:53:54,130
How you learned from my
mistakes of touching fire.

7025
02:53:54,310 --> 02:53:54,820
Okay,

7026
02:53:54,820 --> 02:53:57,760
but it's still known VR
experience for your history.

7027
02:53:58,780 --> 02:53:59,081
Well,

7028
02:53:59,081 --> 02:54:00,400
it's known via science.

7029
02:54:00,401 --> 02:54:05,110
If you explain exactly what the elements
of the fire are and how it works and

7030
02:54:05,111 --> 02:54:08,920
what it burns at and what temperature
specific things need to burn out,

7031
02:54:08,921 --> 02:54:11,080
you don't have to get burned
to know that it will burn you.

7032
02:54:11,980 --> 02:54:12,813
No,

7033
02:54:13,030 --> 02:54:13,181
no,

7034
02:54:13,181 --> 02:54:15,220
but that's how we discovered
fire burns by testing it,

7035
02:54:15,840 --> 02:54:17,470
not via logical deduction.

7036
02:54:17,740 --> 02:54:18,041
Okay,

7037
02:54:18,041 --> 02:54:18,581
I see what you're saying.

7038
02:54:18,581 --> 02:54:19,414
It's only history.

7039
02:54:20,110 --> 02:54:22,930
Science is pattern is
irregularities found in nature.

7040
02:54:22,931 --> 02:54:23,770
We observe nature.

7041
02:54:23,771 --> 02:54:25,300
We see these patterns and regularities.

7042
02:54:25,630 --> 02:54:26,200
Right.

7043
02:54:26,200 --> 02:54:27,580
We have no idea what's causing them.

7044
02:54:27,850 --> 02:54:28,001
Well,

7045
02:54:28,001 --> 02:54:29,110
it wasn't that day cards.

7046
02:54:29,200 --> 02:54:34,200
Original idea about science in the first
place was using measurement to sort of

7047
02:54:37,540 --> 02:54:42,540
understand nature well was on one of
his original concepts of establishing

7048
02:54:42,701 --> 02:54:43,690
science in the first place.

7049
02:54:43,720 --> 02:54:43,871
No,

7050
02:54:43,871 --> 02:54:45,010
his original concept was it.

7051
02:54:45,030 --> 02:54:45,280
They look,

7052
02:54:45,280 --> 02:54:46,210
science is doubtable.

7053
02:54:47,320 --> 02:54:48,430
He said that science is doubtable.

7054
02:54:48,431 --> 02:54:48,531
No.

7055
02:54:48,531 --> 02:54:48,670
Dot.

7056
02:54:48,670 --> 02:54:50,830
It's called Cartesian dealt
in extreme level of doubt.

7057
02:54:51,580 --> 02:54:53,380
He says those are all beliefs.

7058
02:54:53,530 --> 02:54:54,370
I don't have any knowledge.

7059
02:54:54,371 --> 02:54:54,630
What do I,

7060
02:54:54,630 --> 02:54:55,463
what do I know?

7061
02:54:55,480 --> 02:54:57,910
Because knowledge means
zero chance of being wrong.

7062
02:54:58,030 --> 02:54:58,863
Okay,

7063
02:54:59,140 --> 02:55:00,100
zero chance of being wrong.

7064
02:55:00,320 --> 02:55:01,660
Give me one scientific fact.

7065
02:55:01,661 --> 02:55:04,370
You truly trust 100% okay.

7066
02:55:04,490 --> 02:55:09,490
If I take a match and I take a yellow
piece of paper from this particular

7067
02:55:10,851 --> 02:55:11,540
notebook,

7068
02:55:11,540 --> 02:55:14,270
I will light that motherfucker
file at that match.

7069
02:55:14,540 --> 02:55:15,440
That's a fact.

7070
02:55:15,470 --> 02:55:16,130
Okay.

7071
02:55:16,130 --> 02:55:17,690
That's a site that we fact is it?

7072
02:55:18,110 --> 02:55:18,350
No,

7073
02:55:18,350 --> 02:55:19,550
it's a scientific fact,

7074
02:55:19,700 --> 02:55:22,790
but it's not higher than hypothesis
is just hypothesis you up.

7075
02:55:23,030 --> 02:55:23,361
Why?

7076
02:55:23,361 --> 02:55:26,270
Because every time you've seen
a fire touch of piece of paper,

7077
02:55:26,510 --> 02:55:27,343
it burned it.

7078
02:55:27,650 --> 02:55:32,650
So you're relying on your historical
experiences essentially saying there's no

7079
02:55:33,261 --> 02:55:35,000
scientific fact possible.

7080
02:55:35,330 --> 02:55:37,590
Only to the level of hypothesis we can,

7081
02:55:37,591 --> 02:55:37,700
oh,

7082
02:55:37,700 --> 02:55:39,320
this is not me talking
and this is Thomas Quinn.

7083
02:55:39,390 --> 02:55:40,041
I shouldn't be saying,

7084
02:55:40,041 --> 02:55:40,874
look,

7085
02:55:40,940 --> 02:55:41,331
he's saying,

7086
02:55:41,331 --> 02:55:42,164
look,

7087
02:55:42,440 --> 02:55:43,970
we have two phases in science,

7088
02:55:44,510 --> 02:55:45,021
standards,

7089
02:55:45,021 --> 02:55:45,381
science,

7090
02:55:45,381 --> 02:55:46,910
and then a scientific revolution.

7091
02:55:47,060 --> 02:55:47,990
What Standard Science?

7092
02:55:47,991 --> 02:55:48,141
Well,

7093
02:55:48,141 --> 02:55:50,150
whatever the flavor of the day is.

7094
02:55:51,080 --> 02:55:51,913
Let's say today it's,

7095
02:55:52,280 --> 02:55:53,570
let's hit the dates evolution,

7096
02:55:54,620 --> 02:55:55,161
and then he said,

7097
02:55:55,161 --> 02:55:55,700
look,

7098
02:55:55,700 --> 02:55:58,040
every every piece of
information that we receive,

7099
02:55:58,041 --> 02:55:59,300
we interpreted through that Lens.

7100
02:55:59,300 --> 02:56:00,290
He called it a paradigm.

7101
02:56:00,350 --> 02:56:04,940
We look at the information through the
lens of evolution so it makes sense.

7102
02:56:04,941 --> 02:56:06,890
It fits right here in
our story of evolution,

7103
02:56:06,950 --> 02:56:07,783
right?

7104
02:56:08,300 --> 02:56:08,781
And then he says,

7105
02:56:08,781 --> 02:56:08,961
look,

7106
02:56:08,961 --> 02:56:12,900
a small amount of contradictory
information is gonna Pool.

7107
02:56:12,920 --> 02:56:13,753
Slowly

7108
02:56:15,470 --> 02:56:16,161
it's inevitable.

7109
02:56:16,161 --> 02:56:16,994
He says,

7110
02:56:18,200 --> 02:56:18,980
and then this,

7111
02:56:18,980 --> 02:56:19,641
we're gonna ignore it.

7112
02:56:19,641 --> 02:56:20,480
We're going to sweep it under the rug.

7113
02:56:20,481 --> 02:56:21,410
Everything doesn't make sense.

7114
02:56:21,411 --> 02:56:22,550
We're going to sweep it under the rug.

7115
02:56:23,960 --> 02:56:24,591
And then one day,

7116
02:56:24,591 --> 02:56:26,640
that level of information that,

7117
02:56:26,690 --> 02:56:30,350
that amount of information that doesn't
fit in any way with our theory or

7118
02:56:30,351 --> 02:56:33,530
current theory is going to pull and pull
and pull and pull until one guy comes

7119
02:56:33,531 --> 02:56:33,951
around and says,

7120
02:56:33,951 --> 02:56:34,520
no,

7121
02:56:34,520 --> 02:56:35,271
we had a backwards.

7122
02:56:35,271 --> 02:56:36,104
Are we headed the wrong?

7123
02:56:36,110 --> 02:56:39,350
It's this and now all this new
information fits in the new theory.

7124
02:56:39,560 --> 02:56:40,640
All the old stuff fits in.

7125
02:56:40,641 --> 02:56:41,780
All the new stuff fits.

7126
02:56:42,590 --> 02:56:44,150
And that's called the
scientific revolution.

7127
02:56:44,450 --> 02:56:44,801
And he says,

7128
02:56:44,801 --> 02:56:47,630
science scientists always going through
a normal phase and then a revolution

7129
02:56:47,631 --> 02:56:51,920
phase and man is becoming more and more
precise but will never reach the level

7130
02:56:51,921 --> 02:56:53,180
of past hypothesis.

7131
02:56:53,181 --> 02:56:54,014
Why?

7132
02:56:54,410 --> 02:56:58,760
Because science is based on
our faith that their pass,

7133
02:56:59,270 --> 02:56:59,631
excuse me,

7134
02:56:59,631 --> 02:57:02,360
that the future will behave like the past.

7135
02:57:02,840 --> 02:57:04,880
We only know things via experience,

7136
02:57:04,910 --> 02:57:05,900
VR history,

7137
02:57:06,380 --> 02:57:07,700
so when I flipped that coin,

7138
02:57:07,850 --> 02:57:11,330
you have no idea what's going to happen
until I flipped many coins in front of

7139
02:57:11,331 --> 02:57:12,260
you or I give you my,

7140
02:57:12,440 --> 02:57:13,700
if you trust me and I tell you what,

7141
02:57:13,910 --> 02:57:14,211
listen,

7142
02:57:14,211 --> 02:57:15,021
I did this experiment.

7143
02:57:15,021 --> 02:57:16,190
Here are my results and you trust me.

7144
02:57:16,191 --> 02:57:17,090
You just take it for granted.

7145
02:57:17,340 --> 02:57:18,620
You take it on way of authority.

7146
02:57:18,770 --> 02:57:20,480
I agree with everything you said.

7147
02:57:20,780 --> 02:57:23,810
I still don't see where you're
saying science has so much.

7148
02:57:23,811 --> 02:57:24,190
Whew.

7149
02:57:24,190 --> 02:57:24,500
Okay.

7150
02:57:24,500 --> 02:57:28,620
Or science has as much woo
as healers or crystals,

7151
02:57:28,621 --> 02:57:30,020
suckers or listen,

7152
02:57:30,021 --> 02:57:31,490
I don't believe in
crystals in any of that.

7153
02:57:31,520 --> 02:57:32,330
I know you don't.

7154
02:57:32,330 --> 02:57:32,591
I don't.

7155
02:57:32,591 --> 02:57:32,961
I don't.

7156
02:57:32,961 --> 02:57:33,320
I just,

7157
02:57:33,320 --> 02:57:35,330
I have a higher standard of skepticism.

7158
02:57:35,390 --> 02:57:36,440
I'm missing the Wu though.

7159
02:57:36,490 --> 02:57:37,100
Okay.

7160
02:57:37,100 --> 02:57:39,620
The Wu is when we project physical laws,

7161
02:57:41,090 --> 02:57:41,720
combustion,

7162
02:57:41,720 --> 02:57:42,410
electricity,

7163
02:57:42,410 --> 02:57:43,243
gravity,

7164
02:57:43,250 --> 02:57:44,720
these are all appealed to magic.

7165
02:57:45,020 --> 02:57:46,370
Can you demonstrate these,

7166
02:57:46,880 --> 02:57:50,120
these physical laws or
are they byproducts?

7167
02:57:51,920 --> 02:57:52,460
Are they,

7168
02:57:52,460 --> 02:57:56,510
are they inferences you made in your mind
because you've seen a certain pattern

7169
02:57:56,511 --> 02:57:57,344
over and over again.

7170
02:57:57,800 --> 02:58:01,160
That law doesn't exist
out there in the universe.

7171
02:58:01,170 --> 02:58:02,100
It's only a bookmark.

7172
02:58:02,100 --> 02:58:05,130
It's only a name we have for a
pattern we've observed in nature.

7173
02:58:06,680 --> 02:58:07,770
It was pretty heavy stuff.

7174
02:58:07,771 --> 02:58:12,570
I know it's only a name for a pattern
exactly that we've observed that exists in

7175
02:58:12,571 --> 02:58:12,961
nature.

7176
02:58:12,961 --> 02:58:13,351
Exactly,

7177
02:58:13,351 --> 02:58:17,010
so that means you can't label anything
ever because the everything is just a

7178
02:58:17,011 --> 02:58:18,390
pattern that we've observed in nature.

7179
02:58:18,391 --> 02:58:18,650
Everything.

7180
02:58:18,650 --> 02:58:19,441
Everything is a pattern.

7181
02:58:19,441 --> 02:58:19,921
There is no,

7182
02:58:19,921 --> 02:58:21,150
there's no logic behind.

7183
02:58:21,151 --> 02:58:21,984
Nothing's neurologic.

7184
02:58:22,200 --> 02:58:23,550
We give an explanation,

7185
02:58:23,551 --> 02:58:24,780
we give a narrative to it.

7186
02:58:24,900 --> 02:58:25,733
Okay,

7187
02:58:26,130 --> 02:58:28,860
but that narrative is just our paradigm.

7188
02:58:29,550 --> 02:58:31,500
Comscore would say that's
the shades you're wearing.

7189
02:58:31,650 --> 02:58:32,130
Okay,

7190
02:58:32,130 --> 02:58:32,721
that's you.

7191
02:58:32,721 --> 02:58:33,960
You can't set a beautiful,

7192
02:58:33,961 --> 02:58:34,171
he said,

7193
02:58:34,171 --> 02:58:34,680
look,

7194
02:58:34,680 --> 02:58:36,360
you have pink tinted glasses.

7195
02:58:36,930 --> 02:58:38,310
You could have blue tinted glasses,

7196
02:58:38,970 --> 02:58:40,140
but whatever glasses you're wearing,

7197
02:58:40,141 --> 02:58:41,370
that's the song and dance.

7198
02:58:41,400 --> 02:58:41,880
That's the,

7199
02:58:41,880 --> 02:58:42,301
that's the,

7200
02:58:42,301 --> 02:58:45,060
that's the story you tell yourself
of why those things are happening,

7201
02:58:45,061 --> 02:58:45,894
the way they're happening.

7202
02:58:45,900 --> 02:58:46,733
Okay.

7203
02:58:47,190 --> 02:58:50,700
The truth of the matter is all we're
seeing is one pattern happening over and

7204
02:58:50,701 --> 02:58:51,534
over again.

7205
02:58:51,540 --> 02:58:52,281
So what this is,

7206
02:58:52,281 --> 02:58:54,540
is essentially as an
intellectual exercise,

7207
02:58:55,020 --> 02:58:59,460
but the reality of our ability to come up,

7208
02:58:59,461 --> 02:59:00,294
well not ours,

7209
02:59:00,450 --> 02:59:04,020
obviously super smart people come up
with the very technology that we're using

7210
02:59:04,021 --> 02:59:09,021
right now to broadcast this podcast
means that they have figured things out,

7211
02:59:09,961 --> 02:59:14,961
that there are provable and that you can
use science to determine what frequency

7212
02:59:15,301 --> 02:59:16,290
things need to be,

7213
02:59:16,291 --> 02:59:18,420
how much electricity you need,

7214
02:59:18,630 --> 02:59:21,570
what kind of components can you know,

7215
02:59:21,660 --> 02:59:26,660
take the image and projected through
the power lines and through the Internet

7216
02:59:27,211 --> 02:59:31,260
coat cables and all the different things
that we need to be in place to provide

7217
02:59:31,261 --> 02:59:33,450
the electricity to provide
the Internet connection.

7218
02:59:33,960 --> 02:59:34,920
That's all science.

7219
02:59:34,921 --> 02:59:36,420
So this is all predictive sciences,

7220
02:59:36,450 --> 02:59:37,021
predictive,

7221
02:59:37,021 --> 02:59:37,261
right?

7222
02:59:37,261 --> 02:59:37,980
But this is all,

7223
02:59:37,980 --> 02:59:40,710
these are all things that
are not just observable,

7224
02:59:40,830 --> 02:59:41,760
but they're repeatable,

7225
02:59:41,910 --> 02:59:42,271
right?

7226
02:59:42,271 --> 02:59:42,691
The pattern.

7227
02:59:42,691 --> 02:59:44,380
Where's the woo here?

7228
02:59:44,381 --> 02:59:44,670
Here's,

7229
02:59:44,670 --> 02:59:45,480
here's where the rule is.

7230
02:59:45,480 --> 02:59:46,313
Okay.

7231
02:59:46,710 --> 02:59:48,630
Our explanation for why it happens,

7232
02:59:48,870 --> 02:59:51,380
the laws of nature are woo.

7233
02:59:51,990 --> 02:59:53,300
It's not woo is,

7234
02:59:53,360 --> 02:59:57,690
are our words that we use to
describe repeatable things.

7235
02:59:58,830 --> 02:59:59,370
Okay.

7236
02:59:59,370 --> 03:00:00,121
Which which,

7237
03:00:00,121 --> 03:00:04,110
which law of which force of of
of nature are you referring to?

7238
03:00:04,111 --> 03:00:04,930
Let's pick one.

7239
03:00:04,930 --> 03:00:05,170
Lucky,

7240
03:00:05,170 --> 03:00:05,641
random miss.

7241
03:00:05,641 --> 03:00:06,300
Can you show?

7242
03:00:06,300 --> 03:00:07,980
I don't think that is a force of nature.

7243
03:00:08,010 --> 03:00:08,211
Okay,

7244
03:00:08,211 --> 03:00:08,941
so three with you.

7245
03:00:08,941 --> 03:00:09,810
That randomness.

7246
03:00:09,840 --> 03:00:11,370
The idea of randomness.

7247
03:00:11,430 --> 03:00:11,820
Okay.

7248
03:00:11,820 --> 03:00:13,200
Pick one because they use it.

7249
03:00:13,201 --> 03:00:13,920
They say it's,

7250
03:00:13,920 --> 03:00:18,920
it's evolution of a natural section
via a random selection of temperature.

7251
03:00:20,760 --> 03:00:21,480
Temperature.

7252
03:00:21,480 --> 03:00:21,840
Okay.

7253
03:00:21,840 --> 03:00:22,350
Okay.

7254
03:00:22,350 --> 03:00:24,330
What causes to I observe
temperature like you,

7255
03:00:24,540 --> 03:00:25,740
I believe temperature exists.

7256
03:00:26,160 --> 03:00:27,510
What causes temperature?

7257
03:00:27,840 --> 03:00:28,673
We don't know.

7258
03:00:29,790 --> 03:00:34,790
That's true and we don't know we you
and I don't know [inaudible] they don't

7259
03:00:34,831 --> 03:00:38,610
have any idea what causes only tell me
about the patterns and regularities.

7260
03:00:38,660 --> 03:00:39,091
That's it.

7261
03:00:39,091 --> 03:00:43,920
That friction causes certain things
that the magnetic pull of the sun on the

7262
03:00:43,921 --> 03:00:48,000
earth causes a certain temperature
shifts and the these are recognizable and

7263
03:00:48,001 --> 03:00:50,340
repeatable and they understand
how to measure them.

7264
03:00:51,720 --> 03:00:55,620
These are all just patterns
and regularities found in
nature and they're giving

7265
03:00:55,621 --> 03:00:57,150
them names and explanations.

7266
03:00:57,180 --> 03:00:58,140
I see what you're saying.

7267
03:00:58,320 --> 03:01:00,640
Isn't explanations be debunked later on?

7268
03:01:00,880 --> 03:01:02,830
I put them in the maybe
bio plausible pile,

7269
03:01:03,430 --> 03:01:03,881
but this is,

7270
03:01:03,881 --> 03:01:04,211
this is,

7271
03:01:04,211 --> 03:01:04,750
listen,

7272
03:01:04,750 --> 03:01:06,850
I know it's frustrating but
the philosophy of science,

7273
03:01:07,420 --> 03:01:08,253
this is it.

7274
03:01:08,740 --> 03:01:10,000
The cause and effect.

7275
03:01:10,001 --> 03:01:11,680
We do not observe cause and effect.

7276
03:01:12,250 --> 03:01:16,390
We do not observe one thing
causing another and we just
see a and then we see B.

7277
03:01:16,660 --> 03:01:17,140
It's really,

7278
03:01:17,140 --> 03:01:17,561
it's really,

7279
03:01:17,561 --> 03:01:19,510
it's a bit difficult but imagine this,

7280
03:01:19,780 --> 03:01:21,130
we see and we see B,

7281
03:01:21,131 --> 03:01:21,450
we don't,

7282
03:01:21,450 --> 03:01:24,940
we don't see the causal connection cause
if we did see the causal connection you

7283
03:01:24,941 --> 03:01:26,350
would know what happens.

7284
03:01:26,351 --> 03:01:27,220
When I flipped that coin,

7285
03:01:27,250 --> 03:01:28,150
you could have predicted it.

7286
03:01:28,180 --> 03:01:31,960
You called predict what's going to
happen when I file exactly how much force

7287
03:01:31,961 --> 03:01:33,370
you're exerting on your thumb.

7288
03:01:33,670 --> 03:01:34,780
To flip that coin,

7289
03:01:34,781 --> 03:01:38,230
I would have to know what altitude we're
at to understand what the atmosphere

7290
03:01:38,231 --> 03:01:39,490
that this coin is going through.

7291
03:01:39,850 --> 03:01:41,230
I would have to know
the weight of the coin.

7292
03:01:41,231 --> 03:01:44,050
I would have to know that the
position of your thumb on the thing,

7293
03:01:44,290 --> 03:01:45,940
it's like what you said
about the billiard balls,

7294
03:01:46,180 --> 03:01:49,900
that it is true that if you
could calculate the exact
amount of friction on the

7295
03:01:49,901 --> 03:01:51,040
cloth and the table,

7296
03:01:51,070 --> 03:01:53,110
the amount of Polish
that are on the balls,

7297
03:01:53,380 --> 03:01:54,220
the amount of force,

7298
03:01:54,370 --> 03:01:57,760
you'd have to have all the
balls in exactly the same spot,

7299
03:01:58,630 --> 03:01:59,463
but this is,

7300
03:01:59,770 --> 03:02:01,480
this is not possible today.

7301
03:02:01,540 --> 03:02:05,920
Today if you set up a
table and you set up,

7302
03:02:06,070 --> 03:02:09,670
let's say just say nine balls and you
told me you were going to know where every

7303
03:02:09,671 --> 03:02:11,560
ball was to the millimeter,

7304
03:02:11,860 --> 03:02:16,860
I would say I will bet you $1 million
you're wrong and I would be right every

7305
03:02:17,411 --> 03:02:18,010
time.

7306
03:02:18,010 --> 03:02:19,180
You're never going to get it.

7307
03:02:19,450 --> 03:02:20,080
Why?

7308
03:02:20,080 --> 03:02:23,050
Because you don't have the ability
to calculate all those very,

7309
03:02:23,051 --> 03:02:24,280
but it's theoretically portion.

7310
03:02:24,430 --> 03:02:25,870
It's also the physical,

7311
03:02:26,140 --> 03:02:30,010
the physical change of the amount of
force that you drive when you break those

7312
03:02:30,011 --> 03:02:33,280
balls varies and it varies even slightly.

7313
03:02:33,580 --> 03:02:38,580
It's going to change the way so a person
just doing it with their body is not

7314
03:02:38,621 --> 03:02:40,180
capable of that kind of precision.

7315
03:02:40,210 --> 03:02:41,470
If we got a robot to break,

7316
03:02:42,070 --> 03:02:43,690
even if you've got a robot to break,

7317
03:02:43,990 --> 03:02:48,520
you would have to have those balls in
exactly the same spot and they don't

7318
03:02:48,521 --> 03:02:52,780
usually sit that way because the
cloth has fiber in it and it's wool.

7319
03:02:52,781 --> 03:02:57,781
It's a worsted wool and at worst it
will moves and shifts and bends and it

7320
03:02:57,881 --> 03:03:00,400
flattens out in some
spaces and other spaces.

7321
03:03:00,401 --> 03:03:01,840
It gets dirt and debris.

7322
03:03:01,841 --> 03:03:02,674
In Charleston,

7323
03:03:02,800 --> 03:03:03,580
there's too many variables.

7324
03:03:03,580 --> 03:03:05,530
So because we cannot
compute all the variables,

7325
03:03:05,531 --> 03:03:06,010
I'm with you.

7326
03:03:06,010 --> 03:03:06,431
We can,

7327
03:03:06,431 --> 03:03:09,640
maybe we can create a to it
with a slight margin of error.

7328
03:03:10,090 --> 03:03:10,530
Right?

7329
03:03:10,530 --> 03:03:10,750
Well,

7330
03:03:10,750 --> 03:03:12,010
they'll still be a margin of error.

7331
03:03:12,011 --> 03:03:14,200
That's why I said I need
a divine calculator.

7332
03:03:14,830 --> 03:03:17,770
Don't have to even round off the
numbers so I'll be slightly wrong.

7333
03:03:18,250 --> 03:03:19,083
Right.

7334
03:03:19,270 --> 03:03:22,390
But the argument is that if we had
all the variables and that's a big,

7335
03:03:22,391 --> 03:03:24,310
if it's logically possible,

7336
03:03:24,311 --> 03:03:27,490
it's logically coherent with
the reality that we see.

7337
03:03:27,520 --> 03:03:28,353
Yes.

7338
03:03:28,750 --> 03:03:29,141
Random.

7339
03:03:29,141 --> 03:03:30,640
This is by the wayside.

7340
03:03:30,670 --> 03:03:31,900
It's a figment of our imagination.

7341
03:03:31,901 --> 03:03:34,720
We projected when we cannot compute,

7342
03:03:34,780 --> 03:03:35,860
but if we could,

7343
03:03:36,820 --> 03:03:39,190
this is a objective outside of us,

7344
03:03:39,240 --> 03:03:39,550
right?

7345
03:03:39,550 --> 03:03:40,600
The truth is outside of a,

7346
03:03:40,620 --> 03:03:43,240
it's not dependent on me and
you how we see the world.

7347
03:03:43,360 --> 03:03:47,470
So randomness is based essentially on
our inability to calculate variables.

7348
03:03:47,471 --> 03:03:48,120
It's not on the,

7349
03:03:48,120 --> 03:03:49,490
on an actual law itself.

7350
03:03:50,290 --> 03:03:50,890
When we pray,

7351
03:03:50,890 --> 03:03:51,910
when we say that's random,

7352
03:03:51,911 --> 03:03:52,620
it's wool,

7353
03:03:52,620 --> 03:03:52,840
right?

7354
03:03:52,840 --> 03:03:54,100
It is and the strictest way of the,

7355
03:03:54,101 --> 03:03:54,491
of the word.

7356
03:03:54,491 --> 03:03:55,324
Now,

7357
03:03:55,360 --> 03:03:56,580
every logical law.

7358
03:03:56,581 --> 03:03:56,890
Now this,

7359
03:03:56,890 --> 03:03:57,110
this,

7360
03:03:57,110 --> 03:03:58,040
this is what hurts people,

7361
03:03:58,040 --> 03:03:58,671
but I love science.

7362
03:03:58,671 --> 03:03:58,920
Look at me.

7363
03:03:58,920 --> 03:03:59,060
I'm,

7364
03:03:59,060 --> 03:04:00,430
I'm a lover of Sinai and I'm a,

7365
03:04:00,431 --> 03:04:01,040
I'm a,

7366
03:04:01,040 --> 03:04:01,940
I'm a science addict,

7367
03:04:01,960 --> 03:04:02,061
okay?

7368
03:04:02,061 --> 03:04:02,781
I read all the books.

7369
03:04:02,781 --> 03:04:04,430
I am fascinated by science.

7370
03:04:05,210 --> 03:04:08,380
Let's say I take object
x and I throw it at that.

7371
03:04:08,690 --> 03:04:09,680
I throw it at a window.

7372
03:04:09,740 --> 03:04:10,573
What's going to happen?

7373
03:04:12,100 --> 03:04:13,760
You don't know or have any
experience with object.

7374
03:04:13,970 --> 03:04:14,803
Object.

7375
03:04:15,080 --> 03:04:16,190
Object is why can't you?

7376
03:04:16,220 --> 03:04:17,210
Why can't you deduce it?

7377
03:04:17,450 --> 03:04:18,141
Why can't you do this?

7378
03:04:18,141 --> 03:04:21,200
What's going to happen if I had more
information than you need experience.

7379
03:04:21,201 --> 03:04:22,790
You need a history with object x.

7380
03:04:23,480 --> 03:04:25,340
You need to get to know object x,

7381
03:04:25,430 --> 03:04:26,263
interact.

7382
03:04:26,990 --> 03:04:27,980
You cannot deduce it.

7383
03:04:28,430 --> 03:04:32,030
While you would write down
all these different variables,

7384
03:04:32,060 --> 03:04:35,960
you would find out what
people have learned from the
past about these variables

7385
03:04:35,961 --> 03:04:37,040
and now we'd be science.

7386
03:04:37,550 --> 03:04:38,151
Exactly.

7387
03:04:38,151 --> 03:04:41,870
Science is the history of
patterns and regularities.

7388
03:04:42,160 --> 03:04:42,680
It is not,

7389
03:04:42,680 --> 03:04:44,660
deduction is not logic.

7390
03:04:45,080 --> 03:04:46,760
It's the type of lighter
we call inductive logic.

7391
03:04:47,120 --> 03:04:51,380
This logic is the faith that
the past than the future.

7392
03:04:51,430 --> 03:04:52,880
Soon in the future it
will behave like the past.

7393
03:04:53,780 --> 03:04:56,210
So the patterns and
regularities we see in nature,

7394
03:04:56,960 --> 03:04:57,291
we say,

7395
03:04:57,291 --> 03:04:57,531
look,

7396
03:04:57,531 --> 03:04:58,790
if these happen often enough,

7397
03:04:58,791 --> 03:05:00,200
we can recreate these circumstances.

7398
03:05:00,201 --> 03:05:01,034
Often enough,

7399
03:05:01,040 --> 03:05:02,810
we predict it will happen in the future.

7400
03:05:03,620 --> 03:05:05,540
We have a faith that it'll
happen again in the future.

7401
03:05:05,840 --> 03:05:07,940
There is no logical reason why it does.

7402
03:05:08,150 --> 03:05:11,870
There is no not one single logical reason
why we don't fall off the fall off,

7403
03:05:12,110 --> 03:05:13,460
fall off the face of the earth.

7404
03:05:13,850 --> 03:05:17,180
Every explanation we give
ourselves is just a narrative.

7405
03:05:17,930 --> 03:05:19,940
It is always subject to interpretation.

7406
03:05:20,330 --> 03:05:20,930
However,

7407
03:05:20,930 --> 03:05:25,700
with the change in variables like Chyna
shifting of the Earth's magnetic poles

7408
03:05:25,701 --> 03:05:28,130
or I gave you a ridiculous narrative,

7409
03:05:28,380 --> 03:05:29,213
the Gremlin one,

7410
03:05:29,540 --> 03:05:30,171
just to show you,

7411
03:05:30,171 --> 03:05:30,380
look,

7412
03:05:30,380 --> 03:05:31,310
I know you don't believe in mine.

7413
03:05:31,310 --> 03:05:32,240
I don't believe in my neither,

7414
03:05:32,540 --> 03:05:32,691
right,

7415
03:05:32,691 --> 03:05:36,830
but I'm doing the same thing Isaac did
and I'm going to correlate my Grumman's

7416
03:05:36,831 --> 03:05:40,730
three as far as he can
correlate his gravity theory.

7417
03:05:40,731 --> 03:05:41,660
He used the word gravity.

7418
03:05:41,661 --> 03:05:42,380
He made it.

7419
03:05:42,380 --> 03:05:43,520
He made it sound better.

7420
03:05:43,700 --> 03:05:45,110
He made it sound less ridiculous,

7421
03:05:45,560 --> 03:05:47,540
but the truth of matter is he's throwing
his hands up in the air and saying,

7422
03:05:47,541 --> 03:05:47,661
look,

7423
03:05:47,661 --> 03:05:47,960
I dunno,

7424
03:05:47,960 --> 03:05:48,890
let's just call it gravity.

7425
03:05:49,520 --> 03:05:49,731
Let's,

7426
03:05:49,731 --> 03:05:50,780
this is the way to think about it.

7427
03:05:51,050 --> 03:05:51,231
Now.

7428
03:05:51,231 --> 03:05:52,520
His contemporaries laughed at him.

7429
03:05:52,521 --> 03:05:52,731
They said,

7430
03:05:52,731 --> 03:05:53,780
it's an appeal to magic,

7431
03:05:54,380 --> 03:05:56,570
and then when people started
wearing those shades,

7432
03:05:56,630 --> 03:05:57,351
those paradigms,

7433
03:05:57,351 --> 03:05:57,561
they're like,

7434
03:05:57,561 --> 03:05:57,771
hey,

7435
03:05:57,771 --> 03:05:58,760
it makes sense if you,

7436
03:05:58,910 --> 03:05:59,481
if you believe,

7437
03:05:59,481 --> 03:05:59,840
if you,

7438
03:05:59,840 --> 03:06:01,520
if you just believe in
gravity for a second,

7439
03:06:01,760 --> 03:06:03,970
it explains all this ballet of,

7440
03:06:03,971 --> 03:06:06,740
of celestial bodies and how they move,

7441
03:06:07,550 --> 03:06:10,610
but really what he discovered was a
pattern and he gave that pattern in name,

7442
03:06:11,390 --> 03:06:13,040
but does that force exists out there?

7443
03:06:13,670 --> 03:06:13,881
Well,

7444
03:06:13,881 --> 03:06:14,691
not according to Einstein.

7445
03:06:14,691 --> 03:06:17,910
He came up with a different narrative
that fits the evidence even better than

7446
03:06:17,911 --> 03:06:18,810
than Isaac Newton did.

7447
03:06:19,220 --> 03:06:20,360
But it's still a narrative.

7448
03:06:20,361 --> 03:06:20,540
It's,

7449
03:06:20,540 --> 03:06:23,690
it hasn't removed all the other
possibilities for something to be true.

7450
03:06:24,020 --> 03:06:24,771
Without a doubt.

7451
03:06:24,771 --> 03:06:25,760
For it to be knowledge,

7452
03:06:26,300 --> 03:06:27,133
not belief.

7453
03:06:27,380 --> 03:06:28,610
There has to be zeroed out,

7454
03:06:28,640 --> 03:06:30,680
meaning no other possibility whatsoever.

7455
03:06:30,860 --> 03:06:31,693
That's knowledge.

7456
03:06:31,790 --> 03:06:32,200
So my,

7457
03:06:32,200 --> 03:06:34,070
so can you know something that's untrue?

7458
03:06:34,580 --> 03:06:35,860
You cannot know something that's untrue.

7459
03:06:35,870 --> 03:06:38,180
You could believe something that's untrue.

7460
03:06:38,390 --> 03:06:41,120
Knowledge means that this is known.

7461
03:06:41,121 --> 03:06:42,470
There is no possibility of doubt.

7462
03:06:42,471 --> 03:06:45,680
That's why Descartes was such an important
philosopher because he gave us one

7463
03:06:45,681 --> 03:06:48,310
thing that we know the cogito.

7464
03:06:48,320 --> 03:06:49,190
Have you heard of the Cogito?

7465
03:06:49,970 --> 03:06:51,200
I don't remember what it is.

7466
03:06:51,380 --> 03:06:52,430
I think therefore I am.

7467
03:06:52,910 --> 03:06:53,260
Oh,

7468
03:06:53,260 --> 03:06:54,093
okay.

7469
03:06:54,320 --> 03:06:56,550
What is it that we know
for sure cause cause uh,

7470
03:06:57,270 --> 03:06:57,811
you know it's funny,

7471
03:06:57,811 --> 03:07:00,390
there's two great philosophies that I've
read that they went through a crisis in

7472
03:07:00,391 --> 03:07:00,720
their life.

7473
03:07:00,720 --> 03:07:03,810
One of them was MMO has Elliot agreed
Arabic philosopher and one of them was

7474
03:07:03,811 --> 03:07:07,080
only they kept and both their
writings are very like they're,

7475
03:07:07,170 --> 03:07:07,830
it's amazing.

7476
03:07:07,830 --> 03:07:08,011
Why?

7477
03:07:08,011 --> 03:07:09,150
Because they go through this crisis,

7478
03:07:09,151 --> 03:07:09,960
they go through,

7479
03:07:09,960 --> 03:07:10,950
what do I actually know?

7480
03:07:10,951 --> 03:07:11,431
What's not?

7481
03:07:11,431 --> 03:07:14,400
Because they came to this
exact same conclusion that hey,

7482
03:07:14,401 --> 03:07:17,130
it's all song and it's all as explanation.

7483
03:07:17,131 --> 03:07:17,964
It's not proof.

7484
03:07:19,080 --> 03:07:19,980
It's all a narrative.

7485
03:07:19,981 --> 03:07:20,880
It's all a point of view.

7486
03:07:21,180 --> 03:07:23,910
Science keeps getting refined and changed.

7487
03:07:23,911 --> 03:07:24,780
What we more information,

7488
03:07:24,781 --> 03:07:27,240
what we believed yesterday gets
taken out from underneath us.

7489
03:07:27,630 --> 03:07:31,230
Today's paradigms going to be shifted
again a hundred years from now,

7490
03:07:31,230 --> 03:07:31,680
a thousand years from now.

7491
03:07:31,680 --> 03:07:33,030
What can I grab and be like,

7492
03:07:33,031 --> 03:07:33,661
this is true.

7493
03:07:33,661 --> 03:07:34,980
Nobody can ever take this from me.

7494
03:07:35,610 --> 03:07:36,930
That's going to be called knowledge.

7495
03:07:37,350 --> 03:07:38,960
So it all comes down like at the end,

7496
03:07:38,970 --> 03:07:41,420
at the end of the long
journey of Cartesian doubt,

7497
03:07:41,580 --> 03:07:41,971
he was,

7498
03:07:41,971 --> 03:07:45,030
it was so extreme that the
philosophers give it a new name.

7499
03:07:45,030 --> 03:07:46,020
They call it Cartesian dot.

7500
03:07:46,021 --> 03:07:47,160
They call it modern philosophy.

7501
03:07:48,510 --> 03:07:49,890
So philosophy is thousands of years old.

7502
03:07:50,160 --> 03:07:50,821
Descartes comes,

7503
03:07:50,821 --> 03:07:51,331
writes a book,

7504
03:07:51,331 --> 03:07:54,690
he wrote six chapters in
six days and he was like,

7505
03:07:54,691 --> 03:07:55,770
what do I actually know?

7506
03:07:55,771 --> 03:07:57,420
100% without a doubt,

7507
03:07:57,421 --> 03:07:58,440
nobody could ever question me.

7508
03:07:59,370 --> 03:07:59,701
And he said,

7509
03:07:59,701 --> 03:07:59,821
look,

7510
03:07:59,821 --> 03:08:00,660
I believe in the Cognito.

7511
03:08:00,720 --> 03:08:01,381
What's the Kogi too?

7512
03:08:01,381 --> 03:08:02,430
I think therefore I am.

7513
03:08:03,180 --> 03:08:04,680
So he goes through a long process.

7514
03:08:04,830 --> 03:08:05,011
You know,

7515
03:08:05,011 --> 03:08:05,641
if we have the time,

7516
03:08:05,641 --> 03:08:05,801
we'll,

7517
03:08:05,801 --> 03:08:06,241
we'll go through.

7518
03:08:06,241 --> 03:08:08,610
A little nutshell of it says,

7519
03:08:08,611 --> 03:08:09,630
look is look,

7520
03:08:09,631 --> 03:08:09,841
when I,

7521
03:08:09,841 --> 03:08:11,430
when I put a straw in a glass of water,

7522
03:08:12,330 --> 03:08:14,070
my eyes tell me that the straw is bent,

7523
03:08:15,870 --> 03:08:16,141
right?

7524
03:08:16,141 --> 03:08:18,420
Cause the reflection
of the waters is bent.

7525
03:08:18,421 --> 03:08:18,720
The light,

7526
03:08:18,720 --> 03:08:21,210
the reflection of the light
off the water is bent.

7527
03:08:21,220 --> 03:08:21,870
Yeah.

7528
03:08:21,870 --> 03:08:22,141
He says,

7529
03:08:22,141 --> 03:08:22,261
look,

7530
03:08:22,261 --> 03:08:23,094
my eyes light to me.

7531
03:08:23,790 --> 03:08:25,470
Aristotle thought the sun
goes around the earth,

7532
03:08:25,530 --> 03:08:26,490
his eyes light to him.

7533
03:08:26,760 --> 03:08:27,960
Our senses lie.

7534
03:08:28,410 --> 03:08:30,270
And he talks about if I
put my hand in cold water,

7535
03:08:30,630 --> 03:08:32,130
then I put it in tepid water.

7536
03:08:32,220 --> 03:08:33,210
They'll seem warm to me.

7537
03:08:33,780 --> 03:08:35,310
But that's just my bias.

7538
03:08:35,340 --> 03:08:38,330
My inability to tell you what my,

7539
03:08:38,400 --> 03:08:39,030
my,

7540
03:08:39,030 --> 03:08:41,580
my instruments are not accurate enough.

7541
03:08:43,200 --> 03:08:43,621
So he said,

7542
03:08:43,621 --> 03:08:43,831
okay,

7543
03:08:43,831 --> 03:08:44,161
let's,

7544
03:08:44,161 --> 03:08:45,300
let's put the

7545
03:08:47,610 --> 03:08:49,850
empiricism or senses by the wayside.

7546
03:08:49,860 --> 03:08:50,910
CanNot give us truth.

7547
03:08:51,920 --> 03:08:52,753
Can I give us truth?

7548
03:08:53,100 --> 03:08:53,341
He says,

7549
03:08:53,341 --> 03:08:54,091
what about deduction?

7550
03:08:54,091 --> 03:08:54,924
What about math?

7551
03:08:55,140 --> 03:08:56,130
And the local knowledge,

7552
03:08:56,340 --> 03:08:57,420
one plus one equals two.

7553
03:08:58,260 --> 03:08:58,950
Believe it or not,

7554
03:08:58,950 --> 03:09:01,650
philosophers also disagree
with a lot of mathematical,

7555
03:09:01,760 --> 03:09:02,580
uh,

7556
03:09:02,580 --> 03:09:03,360
beliefs.

7557
03:09:03,360 --> 03:09:04,081
So for instance,

7558
03:09:04,081 --> 03:09:04,351
here's a,

7559
03:09:04,351 --> 03:09:05,550
here's a big critique of math.

7560
03:09:05,580 --> 03:09:06,413
Okay?

7561
03:09:07,140 --> 03:09:08,280
One plus one equals two.

7562
03:09:08,281 --> 03:09:09,114
We all believe it.

7563
03:09:10,320 --> 03:09:14,430
But the critique is that one plus
one is another way of saying too,

7564
03:09:14,610 --> 03:09:16,620
there's no actual
information you ever gave me.

7565
03:09:18,630 --> 03:09:22,140
Mathematics is just one way to
sum up a lot of information.

7566
03:09:23,100 --> 03:09:24,330
It helps me give you an epiphany.

7567
03:09:24,450 --> 03:09:24,710
It makes,

7568
03:09:24,710 --> 03:09:25,530
it makes me,

7569
03:09:25,530 --> 03:09:28,080
it helps me make you understand what's
happening on the billiard ball table.

7570
03:09:28,370 --> 03:09:29,310
We'll give you a calling,

7571
03:09:29,340 --> 03:09:31,110
one plus one two.

7572
03:09:31,350 --> 03:09:34,010
You're not changing the
objects themselves in.

7573
03:09:34,020 --> 03:09:36,810
It's always been two
things always been too.

7574
03:09:37,140 --> 03:09:37,710
Yeah,

7575
03:09:37,710 --> 03:09:38,491
it's a tautology.

7576
03:09:38,491 --> 03:09:41,820
You're just explaining to me something
that's out there already existing.

7577
03:09:42,390 --> 03:09:44,130
So if I tell you a
triangle has three points,

7578
03:09:44,131 --> 03:09:45,510
why when I said the word triangle,

7579
03:09:46,110 --> 03:09:47,200
I already told you how three points,

7580
03:09:47,201 --> 03:09:48,630
but maybe you didn't pick that up.

7581
03:09:48,660 --> 03:09:49,770
Maybe you had to point that out to you.

7582
03:09:50,460 --> 03:09:52,850
So Bertrand Russell said it beautifully,

7583
03:09:52,870 --> 03:09:55,240
said look first in his career,

7584
03:09:55,390 --> 03:09:56,550
Burton Russel is a very,

7585
03:09:56,710 --> 03:09:57,000
uh,

7586
03:09:57,000 --> 03:09:57,700
he's a great thinker.

7587
03:09:57,700 --> 03:09:57,971
He said,

7588
03:09:57,971 --> 03:09:58,570
look,

7589
03:09:58,570 --> 03:10:00,190
mathematics is the thing
we're more sure of.

7590
03:10:00,370 --> 03:10:01,480
By the end of his career,

7591
03:10:01,540 --> 03:10:02,373
he was like,

7592
03:10:02,440 --> 03:10:02,681
guys,

7593
03:10:02,681 --> 03:10:03,910
I'm not even sure about math anymore.

7594
03:10:03,940 --> 03:10:04,211
Why?

7595
03:10:04,211 --> 03:10:04,780
He's like,

7596
03:10:04,780 --> 03:10:08,440
I think math is just another way of
seeing a four legged animal has is an

7597
03:10:08,441 --> 03:10:09,274
animal,

7598
03:10:09,310 --> 03:10:11,530
but you said that when you
said it's four legged animal,

7599
03:10:12,310 --> 03:10:14,710
and he just repeated yourself
by saying it's an animal.

7600
03:10:15,040 --> 03:10:16,720
If I say there's my wife,

7601
03:10:16,721 --> 03:10:19,090
I married her when I said my wife,

7602
03:10:19,091 --> 03:10:19,924
I told you I married her.

7603
03:10:19,930 --> 03:10:20,860
That's what math is doing.

7604
03:10:21,160 --> 03:10:22,990
Math is giving you the information again,

7605
03:10:23,680 --> 03:10:25,870
in a simpler form that you
can understand and you think,

7606
03:10:25,871 --> 03:10:25,991
oh,

7607
03:10:25,991 --> 03:10:27,010
I've deduced this instrument.

7608
03:10:27,011 --> 03:10:27,101
No,

7609
03:10:27,101 --> 03:10:28,750
actually the information
was there in the question,

7610
03:10:29,950 --> 03:10:30,783
right?

7611
03:10:31,330 --> 03:10:31,750
Some,

7612
03:10:31,750 --> 03:10:33,100
some philosophers disagree with this.

7613
03:10:33,101 --> 03:10:33,311
They said,

7614
03:10:33,311 --> 03:10:33,481
no,

7615
03:10:33,481 --> 03:10:34,570
a math brings you like can't,

7616
03:10:34,571 --> 03:10:35,141
can't said no.

7617
03:10:35,141 --> 03:10:36,610
Math tells you something.

7618
03:10:36,670 --> 03:10:37,240
Okay,

7619
03:10:37,240 --> 03:10:38,080
let's put that on the waste side.

7620
03:10:38,081 --> 03:10:38,950
Here's another critique.

7621
03:10:39,700 --> 03:10:42,760
One I've personally could
never get around is say,

7622
03:10:42,761 --> 03:10:42,971
look.

7623
03:10:42,971 --> 03:10:43,271
He says,

7624
03:10:43,271 --> 03:10:43,990
look,

7625
03:10:43,990 --> 03:10:45,490
all of the greatest thinkers in history,

7626
03:10:45,520 --> 03:10:48,010
there's actually an urban
Timia critique of logic.

7627
03:10:48,010 --> 03:10:48,221
He says,

7628
03:10:48,221 --> 03:10:48,371
look,

7629
03:10:48,371 --> 03:10:51,970
all the greatest thinkers in history
all disagree like Plato and Aristotle.

7630
03:10:52,480 --> 03:10:53,770
Plato tutored Aristotle,

7631
03:10:55,990 --> 03:10:57,400
two of the greatest
thinkers in ancient history.

7632
03:10:58,030 --> 03:10:59,140
They don't agree with one another.

7633
03:10:59,980 --> 03:11:00,510
They do.

7634
03:11:00,510 --> 03:11:02,060
They both think they
will say you're wrong.

7635
03:11:02,061 --> 03:11:02,531
And then like I said,

7636
03:11:02,531 --> 03:11:03,010
I'm on.

7637
03:11:03,010 --> 03:11:03,843
Okay,

7638
03:11:04,120 --> 03:11:04,953
fast forward.

7639
03:11:05,410 --> 03:11:06,430
Every generation,

7640
03:11:06,431 --> 03:11:07,720
their greatest thinkers disagreed.

7641
03:11:08,320 --> 03:11:10,600
Lightness didn't agree
with Voltaire Today,

7642
03:11:10,601 --> 03:11:13,540
Sam Harris and and Jordan Peterson to,

7643
03:11:13,600 --> 03:11:13,811
okay,

7644
03:11:13,811 --> 03:11:17,110
maybe they're not the top topic
lectures of our war of our on Earth Day,

7645
03:11:17,111 --> 03:11:17,930
but there are there among the,

7646
03:11:17,930 --> 03:11:18,763
among the elite.

7647
03:11:19,360 --> 03:11:21,520
They don't agree on what is true.

7648
03:11:22,060 --> 03:11:23,140
When you ask them what's truth,

7649
03:11:23,150 --> 03:11:24,370
you guys are talking
about truth all day long.

7650
03:11:24,760 --> 03:11:25,690
Can you define it for us?

7651
03:11:25,900 --> 03:11:26,733
We don't agree.

7652
03:11:27,520 --> 03:11:30,970
So if logic is something that
tells us about the world,

7653
03:11:31,000 --> 03:11:31,720
if it is,

7654
03:11:31,720 --> 03:11:33,910
let's say we grant that they card saying,

7655
03:11:33,911 --> 03:11:34,744
look,

7656
03:11:34,780 --> 03:11:35,640
we can't use it.

7657
03:11:35,641 --> 03:11:36,050
We don't.

7658
03:11:36,050 --> 03:11:40,150
Nobody's good enough to use it and get
to a conclusion that everybody agrees

7659
03:11:40,151 --> 03:11:40,984
upon.

7660
03:11:41,530 --> 03:11:41,951
So he's saying,

7661
03:11:41,951 --> 03:11:42,190
look,

7662
03:11:42,190 --> 03:11:43,150
even that doesn't help me.

7663
03:11:44,590 --> 03:11:45,970
So he came up to the Cogito,

7664
03:11:45,971 --> 03:11:46,804
he says,

7665
03:11:47,020 --> 03:11:47,853
look,

7666
03:11:48,670 --> 03:11:49,640
he doubted everything.

7667
03:11:49,670 --> 03:11:51,280
Like even went to the point where he said,

7668
03:11:51,520 --> 03:11:52,420
what if I'm dreaming?

7669
03:11:54,250 --> 03:11:56,810
What if there's a evil demon
or they're always tricky?

7670
03:11:56,811 --> 03:11:56,941
My,

7671
03:11:56,941 --> 03:11:58,330
he went really out there like he,

7672
03:11:58,370 --> 03:12:03,040
that's one of the reasons why simulation
theory is to what people really do,

7673
03:12:04,250 --> 03:12:09,130
what series people consider the potential
that not only is it possible that we

7674
03:12:09,131 --> 03:12:10,090
are in a simulation,

7675
03:12:10,091 --> 03:12:10,990
but that there are many,

7676
03:12:10,991 --> 03:12:15,640
many simulations inside of
simulations because we couldn't.

7677
03:12:15,641 --> 03:12:19,080
That's what the egocentric predicament
we were talking about earlier is you can

7678
03:12:19,081 --> 03:12:21,250
not experience anything
outside of your consciousness,

7679
03:12:21,700 --> 03:12:25,000
so you could be plugged into a machine
right now and this is just a big old

7680
03:12:25,001 --> 03:12:26,020
dream could be,

7681
03:12:26,140 --> 03:12:28,990
and that's why Descartes wanted
to know what would be true.

7682
03:12:28,991 --> 03:12:31,900
Even if I was in a simulator and
that's I think therefore I am,

7683
03:12:31,901 --> 03:12:33,700
therefore I am because
for me to have thoughts,

7684
03:12:34,090 --> 03:12:35,050
I'd have to exist.

7685
03:12:35,650 --> 03:12:39,160
If you doubt the Kogi till you've
proved the Cognito gets to object to it,

7686
03:12:39,161 --> 03:12:41,150
you first have to have existence Bryant,

7687
03:12:41,370 --> 03:12:42,203
right?

7688
03:12:42,430 --> 03:12:43,240
He refined it,

7689
03:12:43,240 --> 03:12:43,541
I think.

7690
03:12:43,541 --> 03:12:45,820
I think thinkers refined
that later on and before him.

7691
03:12:45,821 --> 03:12:47,290
Also many thinkers came
to this conclusion.

7692
03:12:47,291 --> 03:12:48,520
He just did it really famously.

7693
03:12:48,940 --> 03:12:49,271
He did it.

7694
03:12:49,271 --> 03:12:51,470
We did it in one sentence too.

7695
03:12:51,860 --> 03:12:52,760
He did it in one sentence.

7696
03:12:52,761 --> 03:12:53,594
He summed it up.

7697
03:12:53,900 --> 03:12:55,180
That's why if you,

7698
03:12:55,350 --> 03:12:55,580
you know,

7699
03:12:55,580 --> 03:12:56,540
I've heard of Ockham's razor.

7700
03:12:57,080 --> 03:12:59,100
If you use Ockham's razor to an extra,

7701
03:12:59,101 --> 03:12:59,631
if you go create,

7702
03:12:59,631 --> 03:13:02,120
if you go to an extreme degree,

7703
03:13:03,800 --> 03:13:04,790
if you everything with adult,

7704
03:13:04,800 --> 03:13:05,633
you chop it,

7705
03:13:06,200 --> 03:13:08,930
everything did might be imaginary,

7706
03:13:09,590 --> 03:13:10,423
inferred,

7707
03:13:10,640 --> 03:13:11,151
logical,

7708
03:13:11,151 --> 03:13:11,720
empirical.

7709
03:13:11,720 --> 03:13:12,553
You Chop it.

7710
03:13:12,830 --> 03:13:13,663
What happens?

7711
03:13:13,820 --> 03:13:15,350
You have a transcendent experience.

7712
03:13:15,351 --> 03:13:17,930
You'd become you if you
take off all your paradigms,

7713
03:13:18,460 --> 03:13:20,720
and this takes a very
brave human being to do,

7714
03:13:21,080 --> 03:13:25,220
to remove everything that anybody's ever
told you and have the experience of the

7715
03:13:25,221 --> 03:13:26,054
one thing,

7716
03:13:26,450 --> 03:13:27,320
what you would know,

7717
03:13:27,321 --> 03:13:29,240
what you would come to with with mystics.

7718
03:13:29,270 --> 03:13:30,530
That's why I believe that there's,

7719
03:13:30,531 --> 03:13:35,000
there's a place where you can get where
religion is true and science has faith

7720
03:13:35,510 --> 03:13:36,500
and I know it sounds crazy,

7721
03:13:36,501 --> 03:13:38,360
but there is a point and
I believe in science,

7722
03:13:38,380 --> 03:13:38,871
don't get me wrong,

7723
03:13:38,871 --> 03:13:39,670
I'm a,

7724
03:13:39,670 --> 03:13:41,030
I can't pray science enough,

7725
03:13:41,570 --> 03:13:44,740
but there is a transcendent experience
a human has and that transcendent

7726
03:13:44,741 --> 03:13:47,990
experience is consciousness itself,

7727
03:13:47,991 --> 03:13:49,400
not the content of consciousness.

7728
03:13:49,430 --> 03:13:50,720
This is where people make a mistake.

7729
03:13:51,860 --> 03:13:53,210
Consciousness itself,

7730
03:13:53,630 --> 03:13:54,321
reality.

7731
03:13:54,321 --> 03:13:56,060
Your world is nested in consciousness.

7732
03:13:56,090 --> 03:13:58,340
People think conscious is within my brain.

7733
03:13:58,341 --> 03:13:59,174
It's the opposite.

7734
03:13:59,390 --> 03:13:59,961
Your brain,

7735
03:13:59,961 --> 03:14:00,441
your body,

7736
03:14:00,441 --> 03:14:00,740
your uh,

7737
03:14:00,740 --> 03:14:01,041
your,

7738
03:14:01,041 --> 03:14:02,450
your self is in consciousness.

7739
03:14:02,870 --> 03:14:03,380
And when we,

7740
03:14:03,380 --> 03:14:04,400
when we get to this point,

7741
03:14:04,401 --> 03:14:05,900
then all our paradox is disappear.

7742
03:14:05,901 --> 03:14:06,740
There's no more paradox.

7743
03:14:06,750 --> 03:14:08,230
The logical paradox is movement.

7744
03:14:08,570 --> 03:14:09,231
Maybe if we have time,

7745
03:14:09,231 --> 03:14:10,490
we talked biological paradoxes.

7746
03:14:10,640 --> 03:14:11,473
They never end.

7747
03:14:11,810 --> 03:14:12,291
But when we,

7748
03:14:12,291 --> 03:14:15,590
we understand that our world
is nested in consciousness,

7749
03:14:15,650 --> 03:14:18,380
there's nothing happening in the world
around you that's outside of your

7750
03:14:18,381 --> 03:14:19,214
consciousness.

7751
03:14:19,340 --> 03:14:20,840
It's only outside of your eagle.

7752
03:14:21,050 --> 03:14:23,480
The thing you would you
associate with Joe Rogan

7753
03:14:26,240 --> 03:14:28,010
is also happening inside
your consciousness.

7754
03:14:28,011 --> 03:14:29,660
Your brain is within consciousness.

7755
03:14:29,810 --> 03:14:32,720
No Brene has ever been observed
outside of consciousness.

7756
03:14:33,240 --> 03:14:35,750
See and flow in materialism.

7757
03:14:35,751 --> 03:14:36,260
We have this,

7758
03:14:36,260 --> 03:14:41,260
they have this philosophy called Epi for
nominalism that the consciousness is a

7759
03:14:41,601 --> 03:14:43,220
byproduct of this physical brain.

7760
03:14:44,720 --> 03:14:49,720
We have this physical brain and your
consciousness is like a byproducts,

7761
03:14:50,150 --> 03:14:50,983
like a smoke.

7762
03:14:52,040 --> 03:14:52,641
Now we asked them,

7763
03:14:52,641 --> 03:14:54,590
how do you know about this physical brain?

7764
03:14:55,100 --> 03:14:56,810
All we know it because
of our consciousness.

7765
03:14:58,400 --> 03:14:59,930
So if your consciousness is fake,

7766
03:14:59,931 --> 03:15:00,764
unreal,

7767
03:15:00,840 --> 03:15:01,310
then souls,

7768
03:15:01,310 --> 03:15:01,791
your brain,

7769
03:15:01,791 --> 03:15:02,670
your brain's x.

7770
03:15:03,080 --> 03:15:05,780
The reason why we all know about brains
is because of conscious consciousness

7771
03:15:05,781 --> 03:15:06,920
tells us about brains.

7772
03:15:07,520 --> 03:15:09,650
So brains are dependent on consciousness,

7773
03:15:10,070 --> 03:15:11,930
not consciousness dependent on the brain.

7774
03:15:12,770 --> 03:15:14,210
So I know this is a bit of a tricky thing,

7775
03:15:14,211 --> 03:15:15,860
but this is what idealism is all about.

7776
03:15:16,670 --> 03:15:21,500
There is no physical object
outside of consciousness.

7777
03:15:21,501 --> 03:15:23,000
It's all mental construct.

7778
03:15:23,420 --> 03:15:23,990
This is d,

7779
03:15:23,990 --> 03:15:24,471
this is what we,

7780
03:15:24,471 --> 03:15:25,040
this is a,

7781
03:15:25,040 --> 03:15:28,730
we started this podcast talking
about it and we ended on a mind.

7782
03:15:28,731 --> 03:15:29,130
Fuck.

7783
03:15:29,130 --> 03:15:29,570
Yeah,

7784
03:15:29,570 --> 03:15:30,140
seriously.

7785
03:15:30,140 --> 03:15:31,160
This is a serious mind.

7786
03:15:31,161 --> 03:15:32,750
Fuck the egocentric predicament.

7787
03:15:32,751 --> 03:15:33,770
Not In an not an easy one.

7788
03:15:33,800 --> 03:15:34,131
Well,

7789
03:15:34,131 --> 03:15:34,970
it's uh,

7790
03:15:35,710 --> 03:15:36,543
it's,

7791
03:15:36,940 --> 03:15:41,360
it's a fascinating yet impractical
exercise because you will,

7792
03:15:41,361 --> 03:15:45,260
you will do it to the end of the time
we'd be sitting here debating and

7793
03:15:45,261 --> 03:15:48,230
discussing and dissecting the very,

7794
03:15:48,231 --> 03:15:48,771
but you know,

7795
03:15:48,771 --> 03:15:50,280
that's also how you gain a greater

7796
03:15:50,280 --> 03:15:53,040
and deeper understanding of all the
things you have no idea what the fuck they

7797
03:15:53,041 --> 03:15:53,350
are.

7798
03:15:53,350 --> 03:15:54,183
Exactly.

7799
03:15:55,710 --> 03:15:56,081
But it's,

7800
03:15:56,081 --> 03:15:56,914
it's still,

7801
03:15:57,280 --> 03:15:59,200
it's still amazing to me.

7802
03:15:59,201 --> 03:16:00,034
Like,

7803
03:16:00,710 --> 03:16:05,710
how much is to be explored
about what is real around this,

7804
03:16:05,991 --> 03:16:06,824
like the world,

7805
03:16:06,950 --> 03:16:10,000
the reality of the
world around us is it's,

7806
03:16:10,170 --> 03:16:10,520
it's,

7807
03:16:10,520 --> 03:16:12,440
it's greater than any
mystery in existence.

7808
03:16:12,441 --> 03:16:12,921
That's why for me,

7809
03:16:12,921 --> 03:16:13,910
I can't read fiction.

7810
03:16:14,840 --> 03:16:15,770
I only study science,

7811
03:16:15,771 --> 03:16:16,071
history,

7812
03:16:16,071 --> 03:16:16,431
philosophy.

7813
03:16:16,431 --> 03:16:17,264
That's the only thing.

7814
03:16:17,300 --> 03:16:17,691
Science,

7815
03:16:17,691 --> 03:16:17,931
history,

7816
03:16:17,931 --> 03:16:18,291
philosophy,

7817
03:16:18,291 --> 03:16:18,830
religion.

7818
03:16:18,830 --> 03:16:20,480
Cause it's weird enough.

7819
03:16:20,660 --> 03:16:20,871
No,

7820
03:16:20,871 --> 03:16:21,840
because it,

7821
03:16:22,220 --> 03:16:27,020
they're all trying to tell me they all
trying to explain the world around us and

7822
03:16:27,021 --> 03:16:28,130
it's such a hard thing to do.

7823
03:16:28,131 --> 03:16:29,000
To sum up what's,

7824
03:16:29,010 --> 03:16:29,843
what's reality.

7825
03:16:29,990 --> 03:16:30,410
Hey,

7826
03:16:30,410 --> 03:16:32,570
all these philosophies and
theories are trying to sum it up.

7827
03:16:32,780 --> 03:16:33,613
This is reality.

7828
03:16:34,250 --> 03:16:37,160
And to cross examine them for me is far
more entertaining than watching a movie

7829
03:16:37,161 --> 03:16:38,600
or hearing a fictional story.

7830
03:16:39,890 --> 03:16:40,221
Yeah,

7831
03:16:40,221 --> 03:16:40,431
no,

7832
03:16:40,431 --> 03:16:41,210
I get it.

7833
03:16:41,210 --> 03:16:41,631
I mean,

7834
03:16:41,631 --> 03:16:44,560
it's definitely fascinating
and entertaining and uh,

7835
03:16:44,620 --> 03:16:44,850
I,

7836
03:16:44,850 --> 03:16:46,520
I like fictional stories too though.

7837
03:16:46,910 --> 03:16:47,271
I like,

7838
03:16:47,271 --> 03:16:51,890
I like observing creativity because I'm
fascinated by the human experience and

7839
03:16:51,891 --> 03:16:54,740
I'm fascinating by what
people were able to

7840
03:16:55,560 --> 03:16:56,100
okay.

7841
03:16:56,100 --> 03:16:57,630
Create out of their own mind.

7842
03:16:57,840 --> 03:17:02,130
Something like we were talking yesterday
about Stephen King about how amazing it

7843
03:17:02,131 --> 03:17:07,131
is that this guy just keeps continuing
to create these bizarre stories and that

7844
03:17:07,501 --> 03:17:08,311
someone can do that.

7845
03:17:08,311 --> 03:17:13,311
The your consciousness and by putting
so much emphasis on creativity and your

7846
03:17:13,711 --> 03:17:18,711
ability to just write down things that
never really happened and paint a picture

7847
03:17:18,841 --> 03:17:19,950
inside someone's mind.

7848
03:17:20,310 --> 03:17:20,491
Yeah.

7849
03:17:20,491 --> 03:17:21,324
Let me ask you this.

7850
03:17:21,390 --> 03:17:22,230
If he is,

7851
03:17:22,500 --> 03:17:23,730
if determinism is true,

7852
03:17:24,600 --> 03:17:25,650
who wrote the stories?

7853
03:17:26,490 --> 03:17:28,050
Like when you're Reddick has passed,

7854
03:17:28,200 --> 03:17:28,711
when you're right,

7855
03:17:28,711 --> 03:17:28,920
uh,

7856
03:17:28,920 --> 03:17:30,510
when you write a story on a computer,

7857
03:17:31,200 --> 03:17:32,550
did the computer write the story?

7858
03:17:33,510 --> 03:17:33,870
No.

7859
03:17:33,870 --> 03:17:34,703
You wrote the story,

7860
03:17:34,810 --> 03:17:35,520
right?

7861
03:17:35,520 --> 03:17:36,870
But if determinism is true,

7862
03:17:36,871 --> 03:17:41,250
Stephen is just the computer and his
buttons are being pushed by past events.

7863
03:17:41,670 --> 03:17:42,503
Yeah.

7864
03:17:42,630 --> 03:17:44,370
So that's why like one student asks me,

7865
03:17:44,371 --> 03:17:44,521
Hey,

7866
03:17:44,521 --> 03:17:46,620
you should read a book by
Sam Harris on determinism.

7867
03:17:46,621 --> 03:17:46,801
Like,

7868
03:17:46,801 --> 03:17:46,951
well,

7869
03:17:46,951 --> 03:17:48,270
can you ask Sam who wrote the book?

7870
03:17:48,890 --> 03:17:49,140
You know,

7871
03:17:49,140 --> 03:17:50,670
who wrote the book on the
terrorism is going to say,

7872
03:17:50,671 --> 03:17:51,390
well he did.

7873
03:17:51,390 --> 03:17:52,201
Now he can write it.

7874
03:17:52,201 --> 03:17:52,561
Anything.

7875
03:17:52,561 --> 03:17:55,980
He's determined so that these are old
philosophical questions that need to be

7876
03:17:55,981 --> 03:17:56,401
explored.

7877
03:17:56,401 --> 03:17:57,330
But they are,

7878
03:17:57,331 --> 03:17:58,020
like you say,

7879
03:17:58,020 --> 03:17:59,160
a mind bending,

7880
03:17:59,161 --> 03:17:59,580
you know,

7881
03:17:59,580 --> 03:18:01,530
very mind bending for us.

7882
03:18:01,531 --> 03:18:03,430
I'm glad we finally
get this man to me too.

7883
03:18:03,431 --> 03:18:05,100
Like we can do about a hundred of sure.

7884
03:18:05,430 --> 03:18:06,211
Let's do it again,

7885
03:18:06,211 --> 03:18:06,391
man.

7886
03:18:06,391 --> 03:18:07,440
How often are you in town?

7887
03:18:07,530 --> 03:18:07,741
Ah,

7888
03:18:07,741 --> 03:18:08,101
rarely,

7889
03:18:08,101 --> 03:18:10,320
but next time I'm in Vegas
for UFC or something,

7890
03:18:10,321 --> 03:18:11,800
I'll make take a trip over to do it.

7891
03:18:12,030 --> 03:18:12,300
Do it.

7892
03:18:12,300 --> 03:18:13,133
Thank you sir.

7893
03:18:13,260 --> 03:18:13,771
Appreciate it,

7894
03:18:13,771 --> 03:18:13,951
man.

7895
03:18:13,951 --> 03:18:15,480
It was great for Rasa.

7896
03:18:15,481 --> 03:18:15,871
Hobby,

7897
03:18:15,871 --> 03:18:16,890
Ladies and gentlemen.

7898
03:18:18,210 --> 03:18:18,370
Oh,

7899
03:18:18,370 --> 03:18:19,170
sorry man.
