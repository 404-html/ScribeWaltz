1
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:03,960
Four three,

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,153
two,

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:06,023
one.

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:08,810
And we'll live teddy atlas.

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,710
Thanks for being here man.

6
00:00:09,711 --> 00:00:10,544
I really appreciate it.

7
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:13,310
My Dad keeps saying that.

8
00:00:13,311 --> 00:00:17,340
Stop make you guys listen to
anyone out there mad at you.

9
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:18,470
No one's mad at anything.

10
00:00:18,471 --> 00:00:19,910
There's no real set time.

11
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:20,590
You know,

12
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:21,111
I can't,

13
00:00:21,111 --> 00:00:23,510
I gotta tell you since I announced
you're going to be on the podcast,

14
00:00:23,511 --> 00:00:25,490
I had about a hundred people
tell me to get you mad.

15
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,691
They want you to rent,

16
00:00:26,691 --> 00:00:31,691
get scraped every since that we're
firemen speech you gave to Tim Bradley,

17
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,100
everybody wants you to
start screaming to get mad.

18
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:34,280
You get,

19
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,450
you get people hyped up.

20
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,360
Oh,

21
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,340
believe there's only an occasion flood.

22
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:41,620
And I don't think there'll be an occasion.

23
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:43,443
I,

24
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:44,860
I'm looking at this stuff here.

25
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,090
You got a nice place here,

26
00:00:46,091 --> 00:00:46,421
by the way.

27
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:46,990
Thank you.

28
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:50,500
And it's making me think about
the Denzel Washington movie.

29
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:51,400
Uh,

30
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,420
the equalizer,

31
00:00:52,421 --> 00:00:55,460
the first one where it was
in with those Russian guys.

32
00:00:55,461 --> 00:00:56,800
So were like messed up guys.

33
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,920
And he was trying to
protect that girl and he,

34
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,100
he started pointing,

35
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:03,850
there were skulls and
stuff at the guy's desk,

36
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:04,720
you know,

37
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:04,931
and,

38
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:05,764
uh,

39
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,800
he was pointing the stuff he was
trying to explain to the guy,

40
00:01:08,801 --> 00:01:09,170
listen,

41
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,240
let this girl go,

42
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:10,991
you know,

43
00:01:10,991 --> 00:01:12,430
I'll give you $9,000.

44
00:01:12,431 --> 00:01:13,840
Whatever was let her go.

45
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,520
She was like 15 years old.

46
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,301
And,

47
00:01:16,301 --> 00:01:17,020
um,

48
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:17,380
he,

49
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:18,640
he didn't want to listen to them.

50
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:22,660
And so he started the head
stuff like this with the skull.

51
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,130
I don't know if the people could see it,

52
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:24,911
but,

53
00:01:24,911 --> 00:01:25,240
um,

54
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,380
and he started pointing
it towards him and I,

55
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:28,960
the guy didn't like take the hint,

56
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:29,291
you know,

57
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:30,010
the guy.

58
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:33,100
Then a couple of minutes later
he killed everybody in the room,

59
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,470
but it's just,

60
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:38,740
it looks exactly like the
thing from that movie.

61
00:01:38,741 --> 00:01:41,560
The Denzel Washington where he,

62
00:01:41,561 --> 00:01:42,394
uh,

63
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:44,560
he also had guns and stairs right there.

64
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:45,250
There's,

65
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,840
this is Jamie pulled the scenery.

66
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,051
Oh,

67
00:01:47,051 --> 00:01:47,470
really?

68
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:48,303
He was fair.

69
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,180
I never saw that movie.

70
00:01:49,181 --> 00:01:49,391
Yeah.

71
00:01:49,391 --> 00:01:53,950
So you see like the scene
where he starts pointing,

72
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,230
they might have taken this from here.

73
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:56,651
I mean,

74
00:01:56,651 --> 00:01:57,820
they could've gotten it from,

75
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:58,750
it's from Mexico.

76
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,593
Who props.

77
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:00,483
Um,

78
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,151
so they,

79
00:02:01,151 --> 00:02:01,970
they pointed,

80
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:06,310
he pointed at all towards the guy to kind
of warn the guy what was coming next.

81
00:02:06,311 --> 00:02:07,080
But

82
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:11,910
that's probably the only good movie that
ever came out of a terrible TV series.

83
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,710
You remember the TV series?

84
00:02:13,711 --> 00:02:14,544
The equalizer?

85
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,560
I remember the name,

86
00:02:16,561 --> 00:02:18,210
but I don't know that I ever really

87
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,150
watched it.

88
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,100
I was a fat,

89
00:02:20,101 --> 00:02:23,850
sloppy white guy driving a Jaguar that's
supposedly kicked everybody's ass and

90
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:24,750
you'd watch it and you know,

91
00:02:24,751 --> 00:02:27,270
get the fuck out of here with this movie.

92
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,193
I didn't watch it.

93
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,750
I heard a TV show.

94
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:33,390
It was a just a dumb TV show
that didn't make any sense.

95
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,870
And when they turned it into a movie
and had Denzel Washington in it and I'm

96
00:02:36,871 --> 00:02:37,170
like,

97
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:37,830
what?

98
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:38,760
How is this possible?

99
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,370
I'm going to cause you freaking out.

100
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,211
Not really,

101
00:02:42,211 --> 00:02:44,190
but like I was just thinking about that.

102
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,350
So listen man,

103
00:02:49,351 --> 00:02:49,831
you were,

104
00:02:49,831 --> 00:02:52,650
you just came back from
the Canelo triple g fight,

105
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,300
which was a phenomenal fight.

106
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,650
That was a phenomenal fight.

107
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,940
I really enjoyed that fight a lot.

108
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:57,140
We'll

109
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,830
exaggerate how good fights nowadays.

110
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:00,820
Like if they're around,

111
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,750
everything's great.

112
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,183
Everything is,

113
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,350
if a pitcher has one
good year in baseball,

114
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,220
he's great and he's,

115
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:07,990
he's like the next Sandy Colfax.

116
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:11,560
Like people don't wait to see and,

117
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,170
and truly graded,

118
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:15,430
uh,

119
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:18,250
against things that were
out of their IRA because,

120
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:18,730
you know,

121
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,450
we're human.

122
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:19,990
Like,

123
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,823
Hey,

124
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:21,820
I was there.

125
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,080
I reported on it.

126
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,970
It's the greatest fight ever.

127
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,440
And No,

128
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:26,621
no,

129
00:03:26,621 --> 00:03:28,030
but that's what people will do.

130
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,043
What they do.

131
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,670
I think it was a really good fight,

132
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,190
but everything's relative,

133
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:33,940
you know,

134
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:38,940
and it depends on
everything is influenced.

135
00:03:38,951 --> 00:03:40,870
The judgment of people is influenced.

136
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:46,140
At least I see it in my field for whatever
that's worth by what's around and how

137
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,063
hungry they are.

138
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:52,600
Like everybody bought to Pacquiao,

139
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,480
Mayweather first fight
because the fans were hungry.

140
00:03:55,481 --> 00:03:56,770
Their imagination was like,

141
00:03:56,771 --> 00:03:57,640
there's no good fights.

142
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:58,930
There's going to be a good fight.

143
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,050
So they're anticipating it.

144
00:04:02,051 --> 00:04:03,490
So you've got them at the right time.

145
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,480
If it was the 80s,

146
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,190
and you had Leonard Duran,

147
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,250
Porno would've gone.

148
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,460
Hagler Hagler uh,

149
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,323
you know,

150
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:10,961
you had,

151
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:11,590
um,

152
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,423
Hearns,

153
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:13,210
I mean,

154
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,600
you had all these great fights.

155
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,573
Aaron Pryor,

156
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,320
he had all these guys fighting each other.

157
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:20,050
You probably couldn't have pulled off the,

158
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,520
the Mayweather

159
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,210
Pacquiao thing that you pulled
off and it turns out to be a,

160
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:27,740
you know,

161
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,720
a bit of a,

162
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,130
I don't want to say scam,

163
00:04:30,131 --> 00:04:30,690
but,

164
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:31,000
uh,

165
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,151
it,

166
00:04:31,151 --> 00:04:35,230
it definitely was what it lived up to be
because back Ya'll came into the fight

167
00:04:35,231 --> 00:04:35,950
injured.

168
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:36,910
I don't believe it.

169
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,090
I never saw any listener.

170
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,390
I must tell you need to have an injury,

171
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,770
but you,

172
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,170
you're in a tough position as you,

173
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,590
you wouldn't taekwondo and all
that kind of fighting stuff,

174
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:49,720
Lma and whatever part of it.

175
00:04:49,721 --> 00:04:51,780
I'm probably not giving it the proper,

176
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:52,993
um,

177
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,590
understanding of what it was and,

178
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,890
and exactly what part of the fighting,

179
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,641
not just that my,

180
00:04:57,641 --> 00:04:58,810
maybe I'm being too broad,

181
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,550
but I know you did taekwondo,

182
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:01,690
you did kickboxing.

183
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,850
I know that you're,

184
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,350
you were national champion
when you were young.

185
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,820
Somebody show me some more about it.

186
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,073
So,

187
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,393
um,

188
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,690
you,

189
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,190
you do things when you're injured.

190
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,870
I mean like when are you not injured?

191
00:05:13,871 --> 00:05:14,410
If you're,

192
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:15,490
if you're a football player,

193
00:05:15,491 --> 00:05:16,101
if you're a fighter,

194
00:05:16,101 --> 00:05:17,020
if you're in the contact.

195
00:05:17,021 --> 00:05:18,630
But tell me when you're not in,

196
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:19,900
like when there's not something wrong.

197
00:05:19,901 --> 00:05:24,901
So I had never saw proof during that
bout I was there covering it for ESPN.

198
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,840
I never saw proof where he went store or
he didn't fold that hand or he threw it

199
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:32,614
in a,

200
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,470
in a poor way or in a,

201
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,790
in a less than high level way.

202
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,260
I never saw that.

203
00:05:38,261 --> 00:05:38,860
So listen,

204
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:39,820
I'm not in his body.

205
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:40,840
Uh,

206
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,380
you know,

207
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:41,821
and,

208
00:05:41,821 --> 00:05:42,654
and um,

209
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,660
I'm not a mind reader,

210
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,180
but I didn't see it.

211
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,740
But what I did see,

212
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:50,830
I saw him in his trainer in the runway,

213
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:56,040
was more telling to me taking selfies
because they had got paid a few extra

214
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:02,160
dollars to promote some kind of product
where the selfies were attached to it.

215
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,220
So I saw that,

216
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:08,870
to me that was more debilitating to see
a guy before the biggest fight of his

217
00:06:08,871 --> 00:06:13,370
life where people were going crazy
and going to break the paper view,

218
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,590
recommend paying $100
for the freaking thing,

219
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:21,340
to see him taking a selfie with the
mentalities should be in a different place

220
00:06:21,351 --> 00:06:25,430
and normally is in a different place
before you're about to walk that hundred

221
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,710
yards to the ring where you
might not come out of there.

222
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,270
It's always possible.

223
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,680
You have to have that mentality.

224
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:35,950
I thought that was more debilitating
than anything I saw physically with what

225
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:37,430
was supposed to be an arm injury.

226
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,770
So to me,

227
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:40,611
look,

228
00:06:40,611 --> 00:06:41,444
to me,

229
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,433
maybe it's,

230
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,930
I don't know if it's fair
to say it was a money grab,

231
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:50,000
but obviously it was a
bit of a money grab our,

232
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,440
they were beyond themselves.

233
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:52,430
Uh,

234
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:52,731
you know,

235
00:06:52,731 --> 00:06:53,870
one guy was retired,

236
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:54,830
he came back forward.

237
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:58,220
They were beyond the peak of
their abilities in their career.

238
00:06:58,730 --> 00:06:59,690
And I just,

239
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,760
I just didn't see,

240
00:07:01,761 --> 00:07:02,400
uh,

241
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,100
I,

242
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,280
I didn't see that fight.

243
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:05,483
Uh,

244
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:06,980
the purpose to it.

245
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,221
Well,

246
00:07:07,221 --> 00:07:08,750
it happened about five,

247
00:07:08,751 --> 00:07:09,620
six years late.

248
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:10,850
Yeah.

249
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:11,683
Yeah.

250
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,690
I,

251
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:13,610
I just,

252
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:15,843
I mean,

253
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:18,663
I,

254
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,170
I you ever,

255
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,310
anyone who gets in the ring,

256
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:24,260
they deserve to make as
much money as they can.

257
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,700
I never,

258
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,730
I never say that a fighter got overpaid.

259
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,130
Never.

260
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:28,963
I don't care.

261
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:33,440
I never say that because I understand
what it took to get to that point and,

262
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,240
but you know,

263
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,140
you can,

264
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,390
you can play with things and you know,

265
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,253
you can,

266
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,020
you can kind of lead people to things.

267
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:43,610
And again,

268
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,860
where we started with this conversation,

269
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,040
you know,

270
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,670
it's the time you are around the,

271
00:07:49,671 --> 00:07:50,504
the environment,

272
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,400
what's not around,

273
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,560
not just what's around
but what's not around,

274
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,470
you know,

275
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,920
not that many great fights
to be made right now.

276
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:58,580
So what you're saying,

277
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:02,900
so in triple g Canelo fight is important
because there's not a lot of guys

278
00:08:02,901 --> 00:08:03,830
waiting in the wings.

279
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:08,230
It's not like the old days of the 1980s
are the glory days of the welterweight

280
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,110
in the middleweight division.

281
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:09,831
No,

282
00:08:09,831 --> 00:08:10,664
it's not.

283
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:11,990
And the people,

284
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:12,441
you know,

285
00:08:12,441 --> 00:08:12,621
they,

286
00:08:12,621 --> 00:08:13,760
they have a thirst,

287
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:14,594
if you will,

288
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:20,030
to see something that the
PR department can bring.

289
00:08:20,031 --> 00:08:22,830
It can use the right
material because they,

290
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:23,120
they,

291
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,860
there has to be fighters that obviously
a marquee fighters with a name that they

292
00:08:27,861 --> 00:08:30,560
can build it and get the
imagination of to people to say,

293
00:08:30,561 --> 00:08:31,520
this is going to be a great one.

294
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:35,930
So when they see it and
they pay $100 on $85 or $95,

295
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:37,110
whatever the heck they're playing,

296
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,300
um,

297
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,360
for the fight and then it's a good fight,

298
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:45,380
well becomes a great fight
because of all those elements.

299
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,633
Because,

300
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,270
uh,

301
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,103
you know,

302
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:50,390
it's during your time you saw it,

303
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,070
you committed to it,

304
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,800
you sacrifice to pay that money,

305
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,290
you sacrifice a fly there and yeah,

306
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:01,800
it's a really good fight because,

307
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:02,883
uh,

308
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,010
iconic and fight.

309
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:04,790
Right.

310
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:05,490
And,

311
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,400
and I don't think we
separate that in our minds.

312
00:09:08,401 --> 00:09:09,234
I don't think,

313
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,720
hey,

314
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,910
who says we have to,

315
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,260
because right.

316
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,550
It's about enjoyment.

317
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:15,450
So if that,

318
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:16,920
if that makes people happy,

319
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:17,970
hey,

320
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:18,930
that's part of,

321
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:22,230
that's part of what goes into
the mix of entertainment.

322
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:27,000
But I didn't see it when I tried to
separate that being in the business.

323
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,410
I didn't see it as,

324
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:28,801
you know,

325
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:30,140
the thriller in Manila I used,

326
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:35,390
I saw it as a really good solid
fight and they once again,

327
00:09:35,881 --> 00:09:37,530
unfortunately it took away from it.

328
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,840
We'd controversial with the decision.

329
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,913
Did you think that just,

330
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:42,900
I thought the first decision was terrible.

331
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,700
I thought triple g clearly won the fight.

332
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,860
I thought the second
decision was arguable.

333
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:47,670
I started like this,

334
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,720
this looks like a draw to me.

335
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,250
And it was an amazing fight.

336
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:51,031
I mean,

337
00:09:51,031 --> 00:09:53,310
I gotta be honest because I mean,

338
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,390
that's what you're supposed to be.

339
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,620
And who do you think one?

340
00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:00,710
I added one 17 one 12 and a lot
of people going to say four.

341
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,740
You had the to fall.

342
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:02,660
I tried to pick off,

343
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,080
can rattle all week long.

344
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:06,060
I pick Canelo to win on ESPN,

345
00:10:06,061 --> 00:10:06,521
on sports.

346
00:10:06,521 --> 00:10:07,354
And I was working,

347
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:13,020
so I was on team one 12 is
big and it's five rounds.

348
00:10:13,021 --> 00:10:14,060
So I,

349
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:14,461
yeah,

350
00:10:14,461 --> 00:10:14,731
so,

351
00:10:14,731 --> 00:10:15,210
um,

352
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,043
you know,

353
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:16,730
you,

354
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:17,030
you,

355
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,970
you start to,

356
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,041
you're human.

357
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,710
You start to hear people like you,

358
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:22,170
you know,

359
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:25,010
that knows something about fighting
that has had it closest to.

360
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,670
Maybe you don't want to yell at,

361
00:10:26,671 --> 00:10:28,440
you had one 17 one 12 but yeah,

362
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,960
you still got to yell at
because that's what you believe.

363
00:10:30,961 --> 00:10:31,794
That's what you saw.

364
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,650
And I still say it,

365
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,060
I still yell at that.

366
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,133
It was,

367
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,190
they didn't give him credit for gems.

368
00:10:39,191 --> 00:10:40,470
Like jabs don't count normal.

369
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,633
Like

370
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:48,020
I'm not going to pick out anybody because
that's not really fair to do when you

371
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:50,910
have a podium and they
don't have a podium.

372
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,013
But

373
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,080
sometimes it is because they deserve it,

374
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,960
but not generally.

375
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,530
And the judges nowadays,

376
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,430
I think that

377
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,290
they just give it,

378
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:12,030
I see too often that they
almost go down the easy route.

379
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,280
Like you know,

380
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:18,240
they just give it to who's
aggressive for guys walking forward.

381
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:18,540
Guys,

382
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,321
Tom Punches,

383
00:11:19,321 --> 00:11:20,970
it's like their favor now.

384
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,540
Chi.

385
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,830
And it's more to it than that.

386
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,380
And I understand that the
sport doesn't help itself.

387
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:27,720
They don't make a clear criteria for,

388
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:29,940
but it's supposed to be clean,

389
00:11:29,941 --> 00:11:34,800
harder affective punches because the
separation of professional boxing and

390
00:11:34,801 --> 00:11:37,080
amateur boxing is you have to sell it,

391
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:40,260
you have to make money and you've
got to put fannies in the seats.

392
00:11:40,261 --> 00:11:42,750
So you want to see guys get hurt,

393
00:11:42,751 --> 00:11:44,370
you want to see guys and pack guys.

394
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,530
So it's the cleaner
who hurts the guy more.

395
00:11:46,531 --> 00:11:47,161
It's the cleaner,

396
00:11:47,161 --> 00:11:48,870
more impactful punches,

397
00:11:48,871 --> 00:11:49,920
but it's not just thrown.

398
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:54,400
It's not just aggression because the
aggression has to lead to something

399
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:55,243
affective,

400
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,070
affective aggression.

401
00:11:57,071 --> 00:12:02,071
So I I saw for me to get it to that
one 17 one 12 I saw Goliath skin on the

402
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:08,980
outside controlling rains,

403
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,210
controlling distance.

404
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:14,440
You want to use that silly word ring
generalship cause I have the time.

405
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:15,520
I don't know what they're talking about.

406
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:16,600
They say ring general.

407
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:17,790
Like what?

408
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:18,611
What are you talking about?

409
00:12:18,611 --> 00:12:20,060
I just saw the way you judged it.

410
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:20,470
Where,

411
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:20,950
where did,

412
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:25,510
where did you fit in ring generalship
into that into your thinking because I'd

413
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:30,460
like to know but if it is ring
generalship he was controlling range.

414
00:12:30,461 --> 00:12:31,540
He was controlling outside.

415
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:34,120
He was keeping the shorter
man on the outside,

416
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,410
catching him with a jab,

417
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,970
making him earn his way in,

418
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,250
making them pay a price to get in.

419
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:40,660
Now was the other guy.

420
00:12:40,661 --> 00:12:45,520
Can Lob and the other guy landing the
hard clean body shots that sometimes you

421
00:12:45,521 --> 00:12:46,480
don't get credit for?

422
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:46,871
Yeah,

423
00:12:46,871 --> 00:12:47,704
he was all,

424
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:49,240
like I say on ESPN,

425
00:12:49,241 --> 00:12:50,740
he was putting water in the basement.

426
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,310
Yeah,

427
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,270
he definitely was.

428
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,600
But the Jeb didn't count suddenly was
suddenly in a universe where the jab of a

429
00:12:59,711 --> 00:13:01,000
guy doesn't mean anything.

430
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,710
When we don't want it to mean anything.

431
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,770
When we want to give it to
the aggressive guy to the,

432
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,020
to the guy trying to,

433
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:07,601
you know,

434
00:13:07,601 --> 00:13:08,620
trying to get in there.

435
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,460
The question is what,

436
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:12,280
what's more important is a jab more
important or a hook to the body.

437
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,410
What is more important
in your rock to the body?

438
00:13:14,411 --> 00:13:15,370
Clean is more important,

439
00:13:15,371 --> 00:13:15,881
more important.

440
00:13:15,881 --> 00:13:20,881
But if the jab out numbers to hook
to the body through many rounds and,

441
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,760
and the numbers are significant
that it's greater than,

442
00:13:24,761 --> 00:13:27,610
then you have to account for that.

443
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,001
Right?

444
00:13:28,001 --> 00:13:29,560
So you think that people are watching,

445
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:33,130
they're watching a couple of jabs and
then one hook to the body and they count

446
00:13:33,131 --> 00:13:35,310
that one hook to the body better
than they count the two jab.

447
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:39,280
And I don't have a problem
with that because our counted
that way till if it's a

448
00:13:39,281 --> 00:13:40,114
good shot.

449
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,283
Because again,

450
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,423
a power shot.

451
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,061
Yeah,

452
00:13:43,061 --> 00:13:45,760
because that is what's going
to drive people to the event.

453
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:48,370
Right to the sport is a harder punches.

454
00:13:48,371 --> 00:13:49,630
So I have no problem with that.

455
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:54,840
But if the jabs or 20 jabs
and it's two body punches,

456
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,530
well then I'm starting to save.

457
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:01,770
We can't forget the jabs because the
body punches got your attention and,

458
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,010
and it,

459
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:03,590
you know,

460
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:03,850
it,

461
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,520
it moved Gadi his seat a little bit.

462
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,740
Maybe because for whatever reason.

463
00:14:08,741 --> 00:14:13,741
So I'm just saying that the criteria
is not clean enough for the judges

464
00:14:16,571 --> 00:14:17,280
sometimes.

465
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,730
Well it's a bit even bigger mass and
MMA and it's a lot of the same judges.

466
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,480
I mean I think the problem with
judging is it the same in both sports.

467
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,000
You should have someone who
has experienced in the sport.

468
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,690
I mean they have to have a
deep understanding of what
they're actually watching.

469
00:14:30,691 --> 00:14:31,740
And that's not the case.

470
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:35,340
I know it's not the case in boxing because
I know a lot of the same judges from

471
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,050
boxing also judge MMA.

472
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:39,570
They don't know what they're talking
about in MMA and I don't think they know

473
00:14:39,571 --> 00:14:41,100
what they're talking
about unboxing either.

474
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:43,200
And that's a real travesty.

475
00:14:43,201 --> 00:14:47,280
It's a huge disservice to these
professional athletes who literally are,

476
00:14:47,281 --> 00:14:48,114
as you said,

477
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,310
risking everything as they step in there,

478
00:14:50,311 --> 00:14:53,180
there's a real good chance
that they might not come out.

479
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:53,511
I mean,

480
00:14:53,511 --> 00:14:55,910
it happens every so many fights.

481
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:56,900
A guy dies.

482
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:02,020
This is just a fact and boxing and the
fact football to sure and MMA as well.

483
00:15:02,451 --> 00:15:04,550
We'll MMA has plenty of problems,

484
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,061
you know what I mean?

485
00:15:05,061 --> 00:15:05,300
There's,

486
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,920
there's less deaths in MMA,

487
00:15:06,921 --> 00:15:09,050
but we're getting desk from Wayans.

488
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,261
You know,

489
00:15:09,261 --> 00:15:12,260
we have a lot of extreme weight
cutting issues and some of the small

490
00:15:12,261 --> 00:15:13,490
organizations in particular,

491
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,690
all of that stuff is legitimate.

492
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:16,763
It's a problem.

493
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:17,603
Something that should be,

494
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:22,190
it's just a shame that the judging is
so poor and it's been this way for so

495
00:15:22,191 --> 00:15:22,900
long.

496
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,820
Well to the boxing,

497
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,513
I mean you have a,

498
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:27,311
then,

499
00:15:27,311 --> 00:15:29,110
I'm not saying this in a derogatory way.

500
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,970
In some ways it's a good way,

501
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,590
but you have a dictator running,

502
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:33,590
you know,

503
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,140
UFC and no but,

504
00:15:35,141 --> 00:15:40,141
but it's okay to have a dictator sometimes
because at least you have rules that

505
00:15:40,601 --> 00:15:41,434
are adhered to.

506
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,530
At least you have structure and uh,

507
00:15:44,531 --> 00:15:44,891
you know,

508
00:15:44,891 --> 00:15:45,724
as long as they're not,

509
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:46,070
you know,

510
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,740
taking people out and killing them.

511
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,790
I know what you're saying.

512
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:53,790
And so boxing has boxing.

513
00:15:54,251 --> 00:15:55,780
He has no real

514
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:57,941
accountability,

515
00:15:57,941 --> 00:15:58,691
no structure.

516
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,570
Of course the board no real,

517
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,050
you know,

518
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:07,050
a lot of role structure and conformity
and not done unilateral because you have

519
00:16:08,561 --> 00:16:11,680
different states that have
different commissions and you know,

520
00:16:11,681 --> 00:16:15,820
they're supposed to be tied together but
they all act differently and there's no

521
00:16:15,821 --> 00:16:16,720
natural commission.

522
00:16:16,721 --> 00:16:17,471
There's no body,

523
00:16:17,471 --> 00:16:18,610
there's no dictated,

524
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:19,421
there's no czar,

525
00:16:19,421 --> 00:16:20,680
there's no it,

526
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,270
there's no NBA commissioner,

527
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,650
there's no NFL commissioner,

528
00:16:23,651 --> 00:16:27,910
there's no MLB commissioner that
overlooks and polices the whole sport.

529
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,253
And

530
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:32,170
there's those separation of

531
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,570
church and state,

532
00:16:34,571 --> 00:16:35,171
so to speak,

533
00:16:35,171 --> 00:16:39,100
where the people making the
money in the sport are separated,

534
00:16:39,101 --> 00:16:42,640
truly separated from the people
supposedly administrating this.

535
00:16:42,641 --> 00:16:43,750
But there's no separation.

536
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,480
They,

537
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,130
I mean,

538
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:50,130
promoters actually that are making the
money and have obviously a horse that

539
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,581
running in the game,

540
00:16:51,581 --> 00:16:52,630
so to speak that night,

541
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,753
uh,

542
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:58,540
that they want that fight it
to when they pay the judges.

543
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,000
And there's no,

544
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,050
there's no,

545
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:02,471
again,

546
00:17:02,471 --> 00:17:03,251
there's no buffer.

547
00:17:03,251 --> 00:17:08,251
There's no separation where you can
have promoters and managers that can

548
00:17:08,591 --> 00:17:10,930
actually go to the commission and say,

549
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,000
we don't want these judges to judge.

550
00:17:13,001 --> 00:17:13,661
They can't say,

551
00:17:13,661 --> 00:17:14,740
put this judge and,

552
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:17,770
but they can knock judge
his out and in commissions.

553
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:18,604
We'll listen to them.

554
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:19,540
Uh,

555
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,220
the alphabet organizations,

556
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,083
they're corrupt.

557
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,013
Um,

558
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,430
they are,

559
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,120
I mean,

560
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,470
it's not teddy atlas saying it.

561
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:29,410
It's everybody saying that there's very
few people are gonna say they're not

562
00:17:29,411 --> 00:17:30,200
corrupt,

563
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:30,550
corrupt.

564
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:30,711
I mean,

565
00:17:30,711 --> 00:17:32,170
if you're going to be honest
about it and you're not,

566
00:17:32,171 --> 00:17:35,170
and you don't have an agenda where you're
afraid to say it because you have an

567
00:17:35,171 --> 00:17:35,740
agenda,

568
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,630
which is a lot of people
do in my business,

569
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,421
they have agenda.

570
00:17:38,421 --> 00:17:39,200
So then not going to say,

571
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:39,640
dude,

572
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,570
because they're part of it,

573
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,920
if then are part of it.

574
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:42,880
Uh,

575
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,713
they're,

576
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,970
they're friendly with
people that are part of it.

577
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:46,540
And,

578
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,080
uh,

579
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,040
they want to have access,

580
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,180
they want to have relationships.

581
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,520
They say away from it.

582
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:51,111
And,

583
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:51,944
and Eh,

584
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,780
they understand how the culture works,

585
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,660
so they understand,

586
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:55,051
uh,

587
00:17:55,051 --> 00:17:55,441
you know,

588
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:55,920
is it,

589
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,680
is it a smoky room with
cigars like the old days?

590
00:17:58,890 --> 00:17:59,071
Well,

591
00:17:59,071 --> 00:18:01,050
Frankie Carbo was one of the things,

592
00:18:01,051 --> 00:18:01,920
and you put an envelope,

593
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:02,401
no,

594
00:18:02,401 --> 00:18:03,234
it's not that,

595
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:08,350
but you might be paying
$30,000 for an ad and,

596
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:08,740
and,

597
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,321
and uh,

598
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:14,321
at a convention for the WBA or
the WBC or the w IBM for Wbl,

599
00:18:15,571 --> 00:18:16,500
whatever the heck they are.

600
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,900
And you might be paying 30,000 for an ad.

601
00:18:18,901 --> 00:18:19,061
What,

602
00:18:19,061 --> 00:18:20,310
what you,

603
00:18:20,311 --> 00:18:20,641
you know,

604
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,080
why you paid the 30,000 for that?

605
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,060
I don't think that you just like to see,

606
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:24,990
um,

607
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,760
your name and add in a,

608
00:18:26,761 --> 00:18:27,630
in a brochure.

609
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:28,621
There's,

610
00:18:28,621 --> 00:18:30,540
there was a purpose
behind paying that head.

611
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:31,823
And um,

612
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,540
so there's no,

613
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,153
again,

614
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,500
yeah,

615
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:41,500
you have the administrators have to sport
the commissions and then you have to

616
00:18:42,231 --> 00:18:47,231
alphabet organizations that get paid
a sanction and fee fund the champion.

617
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,090
So they want that champion to win.

618
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,310
And so they get to sanction fee.

619
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:55,460
And especially if he's a popular champion,

620
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:56,840
so they,

621
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,100
so now you have

622
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,790
no body saying,

623
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:05,620
well the manager can't talk to the
sanction organization for modern can't.

624
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:07,670
Of course they can talk to them and say,

625
00:19:07,671 --> 00:19:08,990
I want my guys rated high.

626
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:14,500
Of course they have access so they
have access to talking to somebody,

627
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:18,590
influencing somebody to move
their guy up in the ratings,

628
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:24,130
these honest ratings and they have
access to telling an organization.

629
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:25,461
While I,

630
00:19:25,461 --> 00:19:25,741
you know,

631
00:19:25,741 --> 00:19:28,460
I'd like to push a mandatory,

632
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,100
I like to push my guide
to get the mandatory,

633
00:19:31,101 --> 00:19:34,340
which means of course that he's going
to fight them within a certain period of

634
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:34,850
time.

635
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:35,990
He's got to fight the champion,

636
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,400
which I was missing you never MMA.

637
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:37,880
Yeah,

638
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,920
that's absolutely missing.

639
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:44,120
So you have all that
stuff going on and where,

640
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:44,983
where,

641
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:46,880
where is the,

642
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:48,643
where's the,

643
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:49,850
where's the oversight?

644
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,091
Yeah.

645
00:19:50,091 --> 00:19:50,800
Where's the oversight?

646
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,561
Where's the police in?

647
00:19:51,561 --> 00:19:52,394
Where's the,

648
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,620
where's the line where,

649
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,601
because again,

650
00:19:56,601 --> 00:19:57,650
people making money,

651
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,360
people running the sport,

652
00:19:59,361 --> 00:20:00,290
people making money,

653
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,970
people administrating this sport.

654
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,290
It's not supposed to blur.

655
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:05,420
It is supposed to be a separation.

656
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,350
Now,

657
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:09,470
if you know where to go in Europe,

658
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,573
America,

659
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,590
United States too,

660
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,530
but all to Europe where
there's a lot of big fights.

661
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,210
It was just a big fight with Joshua,

662
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:17,931
uh,

663
00:20:17,931 --> 00:20:18,551
in London,

664
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,060
they drew 90,000 people,

665
00:20:20,061 --> 00:20:21,400
which is good for the sport and it's,

666
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:21,891
it's,

667
00:20:21,891 --> 00:20:22,760
it's incredible.

668
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:23,780
Um,

669
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:28,780
but if you know where restaurant
to go to tonight before big fight,

670
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:31,390
you were walking around.

671
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:31,521
So,

672
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:32,354
and I've been there,

673
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,700
you were walking in the restaurant,

674
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,060
I'm not going to say something
and if I can't stand behind it,

675
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,630
and you will see at the restaurant,

676
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:42,800
it's a big table,

677
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,103
kind of like,

678
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:44,780
you know,

679
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:45,650
not the last supper,

680
00:20:45,651 --> 00:20:50,651
but it's a big table and you will see
all the officials at that table that are

681
00:20:51,341 --> 00:20:52,630
going to work to fight the next night.

682
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,610
And you will see the organizational heads,

683
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,920
the heads of that sanctioning body.

684
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,520
And,

685
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,950
and the guys are in charge.

686
00:20:58,970 --> 00:20:59,561
The presidents,

687
00:20:59,561 --> 00:21:00,460
vice presidents,

688
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:01,330
um,

689
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:03,550
supervisors are judges,

690
00:21:03,551 --> 00:21:06,730
referees and guess who
the host of the dinners,

691
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,013
the promoter,

692
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,040
some more with that.

693
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,160
I mean there's something
greatly wrong with that.

694
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:14,420
So the host of the dead end,

695
00:21:14,421 --> 00:21:15,910
it's a big bill obviously.

696
00:21:15,911 --> 00:21:16,810
I mean there's a lot of people.

697
00:21:16,811 --> 00:21:17,770
It's a good restaurant.

698
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:19,570
The eating all the best of drinking,

699
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:21,040
the best wines and everything else.

700
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:26,280
So it's a big bill and it's being picked
up by the promoter who wants a specific

701
00:21:28,571 --> 00:21:30,910
fight to win that night and he's got all,

702
00:21:30,911 --> 00:21:35,911
he's got access to all the judges or the
officials or the organizational heads

703
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:37,961
now.

704
00:21:37,961 --> 00:21:42,430
So I would say to the people that
are listening out there that,

705
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,120
just to make the analogy dead really I
think would hit home the New York Yankees

706
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:56,400
there obviously your universally
known our name and brand,

707
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:01,570
the organization maybe
the biggest of all time.

708
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:07,050
So how about in New York you go to the
best restaurant and a night before a

709
00:22:08,741 --> 00:22:13,741
world series game you walked into the
restaurant and you saw all the umpiring

710
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:15,483
crow,

711
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:19,780
all the visuals that are in charge of
the umpiring for the world series game,

712
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:23,380
sitting at a dinner hosted
by the Steinbrenner's

713
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,500
problem.

714
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,131
Problem,

715
00:22:25,131 --> 00:22:25,761
problem,

716
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:26,594
problem.

717
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,920
Giant problem.

718
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:28,783
Yeah.

719
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:33,600
And it can't happen because there's a
commission would never let that happen

720
00:22:33,601 --> 00:22:34,800
because the integrity,

721
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,700
the credibility of Dysport would be
down the tubes in one moment before you

722
00:22:38,701 --> 00:22:41,220
could finish his shrimp cocktail and,

723
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,290
but so it can't happen.

724
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,870
It happens on checked inbox

725
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:50,490
puns all the time in boxing and just
the look of impropriety is wrong.

726
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,220
It should be wrong.

727
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:55,150
It should be wrong.

728
00:22:55,151 --> 00:22:56,150
A baseball is,

729
00:22:56,151 --> 00:22:57,930
should be wrong and
football should be wrong,

730
00:22:57,931 --> 00:22:58,420
an MBA,

731
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:02,800
but it should be even more wrong in
a sport where you risked so much.

732
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:03,770
Yeah,

733
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:03,951
no,

734
00:23:03,951 --> 00:23:04,784
I agree.

735
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:05,241
Yeah,

736
00:23:05,241 --> 00:23:05,661
it's a very,

737
00:23:05,661 --> 00:23:06,494
very good point.

738
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,300
And I don't know how
you would ever fix that.

739
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:08,541
I mean,

740
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:12,770
how would you have some
universal oversight of the
entire sport and how would

741
00:23:12,771 --> 00:23:15,590
you get everybody from the Wbo w you know,

742
00:23:15,591 --> 00:23:16,424
WBC,

743
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:17,810
they wouldn't,

744
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:17,951
no,

745
00:23:17,951 --> 00:23:18,111
no,

746
00:23:18,111 --> 00:23:21,890
they don't care enough
because the president of the
United States started Karen

747
00:23:21,891 --> 00:23:23,330
when there was a problem with baseball.

748
00:23:23,331 --> 00:23:23,810
He got,

749
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:24,643
he got involved.

750
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:26,120
That was about steroids though,

751
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:26,600
right?

752
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:26,841
Yeah.

753
00:23:26,841 --> 00:23:27,770
But it was a problem.

754
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:29,120
It wasn't that a horseshit problem.

755
00:23:29,121 --> 00:23:29,301
I mean,

756
00:23:29,301 --> 00:23:30,081
it was a real problem,

757
00:23:30,081 --> 00:23:33,650
but it was more of a problem of they
wanted to clean up the image because it's

758
00:23:33,651 --> 00:23:35,930
America's sport and they had these people,

759
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:36,783
the door,

760
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:38,651
the fence,

761
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:40,550
we're going to leave
the game a little bit.

762
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:41,960
So it was a problem.

763
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,330
This was a problem that
was impacting them.

764
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,190
It was loosen

765
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:50,180
w it was impacting the
perception of the game,

766
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:52,690
which impacted the,

767
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:54,803
the gates,

768
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:55,670
right,

769
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:56,810
what they're gonna make.

770
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:59,660
And ultimately the fan base,

771
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:02,630
which of course impacts them financially.

772
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:08,260
It impacts the country because of
less people care about this sport.

773
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:09,290
Um,

774
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:10,340
you're going to see it less.

775
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,480
And if you care about it,

776
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,550
you're going to be one of
the people that are left out.

777
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:19,030
So it was a problem and they can't,

778
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,420
I don't,

779
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,740
I'm going to be careful saying this,

780
00:24:21,741 --> 00:24:23,090
but not that careful,

781
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:25,700
but because you have to say it,

782
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:30,170
I don't think that they care as
much about the people in boxing.

783
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,220
I don't think they do there.

784
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,143
I just,

785
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:32,570
it's,

786
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:34,130
it's more of a dangerous,

787
00:24:34,131 --> 00:24:35,510
dirty sports in their eyes.

788
00:24:35,511 --> 00:24:36,090
Yeah.

789
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:36,380
And,

790
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:36,750
and,

791
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,780
and the people that come
into it and everything else,

792
00:24:38,781 --> 00:24:41,690
how am I going to get into all the other
stuff that you could get into that,

793
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:42,280
you know,

794
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,960
was so popular to get into
in some ways nowadays?

795
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,010
You mean like racism?

796
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:46,880
Yeah.

797
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,500
I'm not going to get into that because

798
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,430
I don't want to and I don't have,

799
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,240
you know,

800
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,030
definitive things to show for that.

801
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:58,880
I just know how I feel precise.

802
00:24:59,420 --> 00:24:59,900
I just don't,

803
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,500
the supports,

804
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,333
it's not,

805
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:03,530
it's not cherished the
way baseball's cherish.

806
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:07,340
When is a big fight like Canelo and
triple g people get excited and a lot of

807
00:25:07,341 --> 00:25:08,174
people will buy it,

808
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,560
but it's not necessarily thought of
as something that represents America.

809
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:14,240
And in particularly in Canelo triple g,

810
00:25:14,241 --> 00:25:16,310
you're talking about two people
that aren't American to begin with.

811
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,593
Yes.

812
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,120
Yeah.

813
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,770
And there's a history to boxing.

814
00:25:20,771 --> 00:25:20,981
No,

815
00:25:20,981 --> 00:25:22,830
that unfortunately,

816
00:25:22,831 --> 00:25:23,041
you know,

817
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:24,810
because I care about the
sports has been my whole life.

818
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:25,943
Um,

819
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:28,123
that it's it,

820
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:29,190
yeah.

821
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,880
It's got a reputation as being correct.

822
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:31,280
And,

823
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,700
and unfortunately,

824
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:34,470
fortunately or unfortunately,

825
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,810
like there's a pod,

826
00:25:36,811 --> 00:25:39,800
the good part where the
history goes back long ago,

827
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,280
father than any other sport,

828
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,413
any other sport.

829
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:42,991
I mean,

830
00:25:42,991 --> 00:25:44,790
it was the first sport in the Olympics.

831
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,710
It goes back further.

832
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,960
And it was the biggest
sport in this country,

833
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,340
bigger than baseball.

834
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:52,170
At one time it was that big.

835
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:53,160
I mean,

836
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:53,611
you know,

837
00:25:53,611 --> 00:25:57,110
so and now it's,

838
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:57,870
it's not,

839
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:59,490
and it,

840
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:02,250
it's too bad because,

841
00:26:02,251 --> 00:26:04,560
and it's too bad that the kids,

842
00:26:04,561 --> 00:26:05,910
that the younger people,

843
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,480
they don't have the ability
to learn about those fighters,

844
00:26:12,631 --> 00:26:14,640
those special fighters that were special.

845
00:26:14,641 --> 00:26:15,474
They really want,

846
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,220
and it was special for different reasons.

847
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:17,610
Like,

848
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:19,050
like Jackie Robinson was special.

849
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:19,471
We know,

850
00:26:19,471 --> 00:26:21,330
we don't have to go
into why he was special,

851
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,880
but nobody knows that Joe Lewis,

852
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,970
who's quiet and everything,

853
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:29,130
but when he was in the army and it was,

854
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:29,581
you know,

855
00:26:29,581 --> 00:26:31,650
segregation and all that crap going on,

856
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:33,863
he,

857
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:39,140
he quietly use his position as heavyweight
champ of the world to make sure that

858
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,050
when he went to movies and they,

859
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:47,030
him in the front row and he saw that
blacks weren't allowed to come in.

860
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,341
He said,

861
00:26:47,341 --> 00:26:48,061
I'm not going in there.

862
00:26:48,061 --> 00:26:49,320
And Liz blacks can come in there.

863
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:54,800
When he went to other sort of events
where the same kind of junk was going on,

864
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:59,100
he very quietly but powerfully

865
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,070
integrated things and,

866
00:27:02,071 --> 00:27:02,731
and said,

867
00:27:02,731 --> 00:27:02,851
no,

868
00:27:02,851 --> 00:27:03,810
I'm going to make a change here.

869
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:04,530
You,

870
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:05,520
you're not going to have me.

871
00:27:05,521 --> 00:27:08,550
And I'd have people that look like me,

872
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:09,601
you know,

873
00:27:09,601 --> 00:27:10,434
kept out.

874
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,090
So he,

875
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:15,900
and there were people I've read about
it because I like reading about those

876
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:16,680
things,

877
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,513
but history,

878
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:18,060
um,

879
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,230
to see how we could be better.

880
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:20,671
And then,

881
00:27:20,671 --> 00:27:21,300
um,

882
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,290
where we've come from.

883
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:26,550
And there were history of black families,

884
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,091
you know,

885
00:27:27,091 --> 00:27:27,891
poor black family,

886
00:27:27,891 --> 00:27:28,724
he said would,

887
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,140
would get hope from just saying,

888
00:27:31,141 --> 00:27:31,381
hey,

889
00:27:31,381 --> 00:27:32,214
Louis did it.

890
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,420
They would tell their kids,

891
00:27:33,421 --> 00:27:34,340
hey Joe,

892
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:34,981
listen,

893
00:27:34,981 --> 00:27:36,000
I don't want to hear this.

894
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:36,901
I don't want to hear that.

895
00:27:36,901 --> 00:27:37,800
You can't do this.

896
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:38,910
Joe Louis did it.

897
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,190
And then so he was that important.

898
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:41,761
That's all.

899
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:43,170
That's the only point I'm making here.

900
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:48,500
He was that freaking important that
that history and the history of other

901
00:27:49,591 --> 00:27:50,460
fighters like him.

902
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,080
It doesn't have to be black fighters,

903
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:55,060
but that what they fought for,

904
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:55,861
what they did,

905
00:27:55,861 --> 00:27:56,730
what they overcame,

906
00:27:56,731 --> 00:27:57,660
where they came from,

907
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:58,890
her bedding leaded,

908
00:27:59,190 --> 00:27:59,700
um,

909
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,530
one of the greatest Jewish
fighters of all time.

910
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:02,850
It was a time when,

911
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:03,790
uh,

912
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:03,930
and,

913
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:04,860
and it's still around.

914
00:28:04,861 --> 00:28:07,110
Unfortunately there's
a lot of antisemitism,

915
00:28:07,111 --> 00:28:09,510
but there was a time where it,

916
00:28:09,511 --> 00:28:09,811
you know,

917
00:28:09,811 --> 00:28:11,770
it was tough being a Jew and,

918
00:28:11,771 --> 00:28:12,690
and you're,

919
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:17,220
you're growing up and he get caught or
cake and have I'm pronouncing right.

920
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,110
I think it was right.

921
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,051
And you get caught.

922
00:28:19,051 --> 00:28:19,591
All those kinds of,

923
00:28:19,591 --> 00:28:20,850
I don't even know what the hell it means.

924
00:28:20,851 --> 00:28:23,730
I just know it's a bad
name to call Joe and,

925
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:29,100
and you had all that
stuff going on and Jews,

926
00:28:29,101 --> 00:28:33,500
woman thought of being there were thought
of moving towards banking and they're

927
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:36,960
moving towards things will make them
money and that later on they started doing

928
00:28:36,961 --> 00:28:41,430
that but they wouldn't the ghettos and
they were trying to pull themselves out.

929
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:43,200
And so at that era,

930
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:47,940
during that time to twenties to thirties
the truth was some of the best fighters

931
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:49,470
because that was their way of getting out.

932
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,110
But there was other,

933
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:57,170
there was another significance to be in
a Jewish fighter that a lot of the kids,

934
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:01,550
their own thought of is bringing Tufts.

935
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,270
So they got picked on and,

936
00:29:03,271 --> 00:29:07,050
and thought of that they're going to go
more towards academic and other stuff.

937
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:10,710
So there was a weakness
perceived not true.

938
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,470
None of this stuff is useful.

939
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,160
Yeah.

940
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:18,120
So now all of a sudden Benny
Leonard comes along when the sports,

941
00:29:18,121 --> 00:29:22,890
the biggest sport in the country and
he's the best fighter in the game.

942
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:28,880
And he calmed his hair before he got in
the ring and he would come out without

943
00:29:30,481 --> 00:29:31,380
it being mast.

944
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:33,120
And this was,

945
00:29:33,121 --> 00:29:34,050
this guy was,

946
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,913
I mean he was,

947
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:36,240
he was Michael Jordan.

948
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,380
I mean before that stuff performed,

949
00:29:38,381 --> 00:29:40,080
Michael joined before Air Jordan.

950
00:29:40,081 --> 00:29:40,914
Bill pointed,

951
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,050
I mean this guy was down only coffee,

952
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,260
cause I'm only a champion,

953
00:29:44,261 --> 00:29:48,580
puts obviously connected
to be in tough by itself.

954
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,180
But it was,

955
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,160
he was smart.

956
00:29:51,161 --> 00:29:51,850
He was,

957
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:52,690
he was cool.

958
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,520
He had Pazazz,

959
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:58,420
he was a man and there
were Jewish families.

960
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:00,220
You don't hear about these stories,

961
00:30:00,221 --> 00:30:05,221
but there were Jewish families I've read
and I've heard from people where say,

962
00:30:06,821 --> 00:30:07,654
Hey,

963
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:10,030
don't let nobody pick on you.

964
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,520
Benny Leonard is the best
fighter in the world.

965
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:18,510
Choose a tough where we're
not just smart but tough.

966
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:21,910
Benny Leonard shows that.

967
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:24,160
So that kind of history,

968
00:30:24,161 --> 00:30:29,161
that kind of pulling of people
up in many different ways,

969
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,310
not just economically I out of poverty,

970
00:30:33,311 --> 00:30:33,880
but,

971
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,500
but emotionally,

972
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:36,933
mentally,

973
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:39,130
because you can be in poverty mentally,

974
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,740
you can be in a low place mentally.

975
00:30:41,741 --> 00:30:43,060
It doesn't have to be,

976
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:43,660
you know,

977
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,160
financially all the time.

978
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:46,241
You know,

979
00:30:46,241 --> 00:30:50,020
where you have holes in your shoes and
you and you're wearing shirts that don't

980
00:30:50,021 --> 00:30:50,620
fit.

981
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:50,990
No,

982
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:55,980
it can be the way you feel about
yourself that is without is.

983
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,480
It's without prince parity,

984
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:00,100
with with without value.

985
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,920
You'll have no value for
yourself as a person.

986
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:06,100
That's the worst poverty
in the freaking world.

987
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:10,660
There's not the lower than that
and Joe Lewis and Benny Leonard,

988
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:11,380
they were fighters.

989
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,790
They won't baseball players.

990
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:15,580
They pulled people out of those places.

991
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,220
They let people know they had value,

992
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:19,650
that their rates had value,

993
00:31:19,651 --> 00:31:20,860
their people add value,

994
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:26,160
they had value and that should be known
and you can go anywhere and I'm glad you

995
00:31:28,061 --> 00:31:29,710
can because I love all sports.

996
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:33,610
You can go anywhere and you can read
about the greatness of the baseball plays

997
00:31:33,611 --> 00:31:34,470
in the greatness of,

998
00:31:34,471 --> 00:31:36,460
of course NFL hasn't
been around that long,

999
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:40,600
but the greatness of those players
and the greatness of the NBA players,

1000
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:45,900
but where did the kids have a get to
read and to hear and to see about the

1001
00:31:46,841 --> 00:31:48,190
greatness of these people,

1002
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:49,270
these fighters?

1003
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,650
V Nowhere,

1004
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:52,210
very little.

1005
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:53,201
Very little.

1006
00:31:53,201 --> 00:31:54,130
It's not there.

1007
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:55,653
Why?

1008
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,700
Because again,

1009
00:31:57,701 --> 00:31:59,470
I'm not going to get into craziness,

1010
00:31:59,471 --> 00:32:03,140
but the powers that be the listen,

1011
00:32:03,141 --> 00:32:04,570
it's not marketed properly.

1012
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:05,260
I get it.

1013
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,780
It doesn't have a commission so
it doesn't take care of itself.

1014
00:32:07,781 --> 00:32:08,650
The way the UFC,

1015
00:32:08,651 --> 00:32:12,880
the greatness about to why the UFC grew
so much as they marketed themselves in a

1016
00:32:12,881 --> 00:32:13,750
tremendous way.

1017
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,220
So there's nobody,

1018
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,690
boxing is just dead.

1019
00:32:16,691 --> 00:32:17,740
It takes care of itself.

1020
00:32:17,741 --> 00:32:20,260
It exist because it's man against man,

1021
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,850
so it's always going to be there,

1022
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,220
but nobody's building it.

1023
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:28,300
Nobody's marketing and no one's
feeding the monster to make it bigger.

1024
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:31,270
And it's a plant that's in the corner of,

1025
00:32:31,271 --> 00:32:31,690
of,

1026
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:34,450
of your office that doesn't get sun,

1027
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:35,790
doesn't get warranted,

1028
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:37,600
but it's still there.

1029
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:39,063
It's still,

1030
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:41,810
and what I'm saying is that

1031
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:47,060
[inaudible] I didn't want to yell
because now probably happy but,

1032
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,043
but

1033
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,230
it should be fed a little bit.

1034
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,130
It should be watered a little bit
because of what I just described.

1035
00:32:58,780 --> 00:32:59,613
Guys,

1036
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,650
guys like you guys who have a deep
appreciation for the history of the sport

1037
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:05,370
guy,

1038
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:09,000
guys who have a deep appreciation
of what it meant when Joe Louis,

1039
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,920
Max Schmeling guys,

1040
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:14,490
guys who understand what it meant when
sugar ray Robinson was the best fighter

1041
00:33:14,491 --> 00:33:18,330
in the world and everybody knew and he
pulled up in a fucking pink Cadillac with

1042
00:33:18,331 --> 00:33:19,200
a beautiful suit on

1043
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:19,910
and any,

1044
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:21,510
any made the elevated,

1045
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,030
elevated people in Harlem everywhere.

1046
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:25,141
But Harlem,

1047
00:33:25,141 --> 00:33:25,590
he had,

1048
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:26,840
he owned have a Harlem,

1049
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:30,880
he owned restaurants and
stores and barber shops and,

1050
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,130
and everything.

1051
00:33:32,131 --> 00:33:32,640
And,

1052
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,210
and you want it to be there because
that's where sugar ray Robinson came from.

1053
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:37,260
Yup.

1054
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,093
It was great.

1055
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:39,463
Yeah.

1056
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:39,980
I mean,

1057
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:42,270
it's a rich part of history
that really does get ignored.

1058
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:43,250
Let me tell you something.

1059
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:43,771
I was smelling,

1060
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:44,311
you brought up,

1061
00:33:44,311 --> 00:33:44,611
you know,

1062
00:33:44,611 --> 00:33:49,611
a lot of his stuff and that's
what it's nice to talk about.

1063
00:33:49,711 --> 00:33:50,544
Which

1064
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:54,990
smelling was a hell of a fighter.

1065
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,420
Joe Lewis was the brown
bomber who was coming up.

1066
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:00,210
He was undefeated and um,

1067
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:02,820
Schmoley had to Greg
quote before the fight.

1068
00:34:02,821 --> 00:34:03,001
You know,

1069
00:34:03,001 --> 00:34:06,270
it's kind of like the grapefruit thing
that did it really happen where he

1070
00:34:06,271 --> 00:34:07,800
pointed out and then he hit,

1071
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:08,311
you know,

1072
00:34:08,311 --> 00:34:08,641
those,

1073
00:34:08,641 --> 00:34:09,570
those are great stories,

1074
00:34:09,571 --> 00:34:09,800
but,

1075
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,140
but what's the real truth behind them?

1076
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:13,471
You know,

1077
00:34:13,471 --> 00:34:14,010
we don't know.

1078
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:14,910
We don't care.

1079
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:16,680
We don't care to a certain point.

1080
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,543
You know why?

1081
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:19,500
Because they let us feel good.

1082
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:24,150
They let us dream about possibilities
and we should all have possibilities to

1083
00:34:24,151 --> 00:34:24,984
dream about.

1084
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,710
And they make somebody feel good because,

1085
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:29,760
you know,

1086
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,010
the Babe Ruth one was
connected to a sick kid.

1087
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:34,350
So it's a nice thing.

1088
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:39,920
It's where sports can be better
than just sports than just somebody

1089
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:43,320
participating in it.

1090
00:34:43,321 --> 00:34:44,610
It can go beyond that.

1091
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:48,420
He agreed stronger than that and
that's some of the good stuff about it.

1092
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:52,650
And so smelling the great story,

1093
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,900
he didn't point to,

1094
00:34:54,901 --> 00:34:55,231
you know,

1095
00:34:55,231 --> 00:34:55,890
the,

1096
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:56,521
to the fence,

1097
00:34:56,521 --> 00:34:59,370
but he said before the fight,

1098
00:34:59,371 --> 00:35:00,600
I see something,

1099
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:01,480
uh,

1100
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:01,780
with,

1101
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:01,930
uh,

1102
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:02,763
that's my,

1103
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:03,461
my,

1104
00:35:03,461 --> 00:35:03,750
uh,

1105
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,610
my trying to be an accent for the German,

1106
00:35:05,611 --> 00:35:06,290
you know,

1107
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:06,690
but I,

1108
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:09,420
I sound more like Sholtz
from Hogan's heroes.

1109
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,701
I don't know why.

1110
00:35:11,701 --> 00:35:13,920
Every time you tried to do
something like with certain,

1111
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:14,670
you know,

1112
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,503
ethnic,

1113
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:15,900
you know,

1114
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:16,770
pronunciations,

1115
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:17,933
um,

1116
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:18,381
you,

1117
00:35:18,381 --> 00:35:21,090
you sound like you go
to one of those sitcoms,

1118
00:35:21,091 --> 00:35:22,350
you go to one of those places,

1119
00:35:22,351 --> 00:35:22,920
you know,

1120
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,210
and when I say somebody,

1121
00:35:24,211 --> 00:35:24,901
I think my kid,

1122
00:35:24,901 --> 00:35:25,734
I think my son said,

1123
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:26,903
Eh,

1124
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:27,421
you know,

1125
00:35:27,421 --> 00:35:32,421
he had watched one of them and I think
he said he sounded like Sergeant Schultz,

1126
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,160
like from Hogan's heroes,

1127
00:35:35,161 --> 00:35:35,994
but,

1128
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:41,240
and he said I something and what he saw
was that Louis would jab and he would

1129
00:35:42,961 --> 00:35:43,231
leave.

1130
00:35:43,231 --> 00:35:44,640
You should never leave your head on a,

1131
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,640
on the right side because
if you leave your head,

1132
00:35:47,641 --> 00:35:47,851
you know,

1133
00:35:47,851 --> 00:35:49,290
you move your head to the right side,

1134
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,150
you're in a path to the right hand.

1135
00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:54,420
You should actually finish on the left
side because then you're outside the

1136
00:35:54,421 --> 00:35:55,254
right hand,

1137
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,233
you follow,

1138
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,830
there's the right hand over here.

1139
00:35:58,950 --> 00:35:59,970
It can hit you over.

1140
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:00,261
Yeah.

1141
00:36:00,261 --> 00:36:01,094
Outside.

1142
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:03,510
So he had a habit of,

1143
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:04,740
and he had a great trainer.

1144
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:08,970
He had a habit though at that point
of leaving his head off and a right.

1145
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:13,530
So smelling saw something as
he said that he could hit.

1146
00:36:13,531 --> 00:36:14,220
And we were right in,

1147
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,560
he could time it over the gym.

1148
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:21,690
Now smelling was of the ilk
of the level of the caliber.

1149
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:23,760
Wasn't just about talent.

1150
00:36:23,761 --> 00:36:25,500
He could punch it was a good fighter,

1151
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,240
but it was a pro.

1152
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,410
What do I mean by that?

1153
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,400
A lot of guys would hesitate a little bit.

1154
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,300
Same opening.

1155
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,063
They might see it,

1156
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:38,040
but it was the brown bomber
who was knocking everyone out.

1157
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,330
So they hesitate.

1158
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:39,960
They will.

1159
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,300
They were afraid normal.

1160
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:44,310
But people are afraid of that word.

1161
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:46,530
I mean it's there.

1162
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:47,791
I mean without it,

1163
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:48,624
we're not alive.

1164
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:51,750
So he,

1165
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:52,520
they,

1166
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,820
they might see the same thing,

1167
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:55,680
but they weren't going at a pro level.

1168
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,680
Pro Level is a guy that can do what he
has to do and no emotions interfere with

1169
00:37:01,021 --> 00:37:01,800
doing it.

1170
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,470
I mean that's my simplest way
of Webster's might not say that,

1171
00:37:04,471 --> 00:37:05,310
but that's what I would say.

1172
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:10,670
So they might've seen the opening but
they would hesitate just enough and it'd

1173
00:37:11,621 --> 00:37:13,170
be gone the door close.

1174
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,960
Cause it's so it's like life.

1175
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:17,880
It's moments captured moment,

1176
00:37:17,881 --> 00:37:18,714
lose a moment.

1177
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:19,500
And,

1178
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,760
but this guy was a pro.

1179
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:21,990
He,

1180
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:25,950
he didn't let that come in there
and make them hesitate that,

1181
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:26,843
that fear,

1182
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:27,683
he controlled it.

1183
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,340
And if a Doberman was there,

1184
00:37:29,341 --> 00:37:29,850
Bang,

1185
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:30,930
he was going to throw the punch.

1186
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:34,890
So he did and he dropped lose
a few times and you know,

1187
00:37:34,891 --> 00:37:35,210
he,

1188
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:39,230
he won that fight and
was around and stop them.

1189
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,200
I can't even remember,

1190
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:40,800
maybe,

1191
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,880
maybe the ninth,

1192
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:43,170
but it was late in a fight,

1193
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,480
but he had heard them and you know,

1194
00:37:45,481 --> 00:37:48,720
Louis was taking a beating.

1195
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,610
So Louis went on,

1196
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:57,630
he won a world title and um,

1197
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:01,260
he'd be Bradick for the title,

1198
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,220
Cinderella Man.

1199
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,050
Great movie.

1200
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:03,883
It maybe,

1201
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:04,711
you know,

1202
00:38:04,711 --> 00:38:07,260
he came from welfare to
be in a world champion.

1203
00:38:07,261 --> 00:38:09,450
That's the product story without
getting into it too much.

1204
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:14,690
So he lose pizza product and
had to give a percentage.

1205
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,273
You know,

1206
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,770
Don King and Ara might
not been around then,

1207
00:38:19,771 --> 00:38:20,220
but,

1208
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:24,300
but the people that taught him what
to do around taught them how to take

1209
00:38:24,301 --> 00:38:25,230
advantage of fighters,

1210
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,131
told them of how,

1211
00:38:26,131 --> 00:38:29,010
of what options were for four
options where ever known,

1212
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:30,470
you know,

1213
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:31,050
Eh,

1214
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:31,520
Eh,

1215
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,590
the Vladik I think,

1216
00:38:34,591 --> 00:38:35,710
I forget his name,

1217
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,270
but products manager.

1218
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:42,360
Basically made Lewis and his people agree
to give them a percentage of his purse

1219
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:44,740
for the rest of his
career to get the fight.

1220
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:46,343
Yeah.

1221
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,230
Yeah.

1222
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:50,500
So I mean you could obviously
research it and look into how much,

1223
00:38:50,501 --> 00:38:51,110
what percent.

1224
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:51,801
So I don't know.

1225
00:38:51,801 --> 00:38:52,600
I listen,

1226
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:57,600
I could say 10% but I don't want to say
definitively because I'm not positive,

1227
00:38:58,510 --> 00:38:59,343
but,

1228
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:01,690
but there was an
understanding that you know,

1229
00:39:01,691 --> 00:39:01,871
you,

1230
00:39:01,871 --> 00:39:06,070
you're not getting a fight otherwise you
won't get the fight now and listen to,

1231
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,533
like I said,

1232
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:08,680
you know,

1233
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,640
not great guys,

1234
00:39:09,641 --> 00:39:12,750
but king and uh,

1235
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:14,100
they,

1236
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:17,410
they had other guys before them that
taught them some of these moves,

1237
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,460
you know,

1238
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,630
that warm and so nice.

1239
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:23,050
But there's always a
history of good and bad.

1240
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:23,680
Sure.

1241
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,280
Always.

1242
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,113
Who's good?

1243
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,790
Well this is,

1244
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:29,050
if there's a,

1245
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:31,270
like a shining star promoter out there,

1246
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,340
I try to think about it,

1247
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,710
but so we,

1248
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,360
so they go and they are,

1249
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:42,280
he wouldn't sign the title and of
course the biggest sport in the country.

1250
00:39:42,281 --> 00:39:44,650
So all the prices there and there,

1251
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,950
Joe Champion was not yet.

1252
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,233
Not yet.

1253
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,033
What do you mean not yet?

1254
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,353
Just one the title.

1255
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:53,733
Not yet.

1256
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:54,101
Not Too.

1257
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:54,934
I beat that man.

1258
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:56,920
He didn't even have to say his name.

1259
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:57,880
Not Too,

1260
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,660
I beat that man.

1261
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,920
That's how much pride he had.

1262
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,630
And listen,

1263
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:04,960
he's the real deal because in his mind,

1264
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:07,540
how can I be champion
if a guy knocked me out?

1265
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:08,410
Right?

1266
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:10,750
So when that fight took place,

1267
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:15,370
I mean you talk about setting a stage,

1268
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,360
you know,

1269
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,620
the nowadays people say,

1270
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:19,180
oh I'm on the stage is a lot of pressure,

1271
00:40:19,181 --> 00:40:19,930
you know,

1272
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:20,201
hey,

1273
00:40:20,201 --> 00:40:21,250
I'm not saying it's not,

1274
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,570
I'm not saying it,

1275
00:40:22,571 --> 00:40:24,070
but a lot of pressure,

1276
00:40:24,071 --> 00:40:24,380
you know,

1277
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:24,840
Amazon,

1278
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,840
a lot of people look in,

1279
00:40:25,841 --> 00:40:26,674
a lot of people,

1280
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:27,280
you know,

1281
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,220
dependent on I,

1282
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:29,800
I lot of stuff going on,

1283
00:40:29,801 --> 00:40:30,634
you know,

1284
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,900
and I,

1285
00:40:31,901 --> 00:40:32,620
you know,

1286
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,330
maybe I got a headache,

1287
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:39,810
but Cho Lewis had world
war two on the horizon.

1288
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:46,680
The president of the United States
call them up and you had Nazi Germany,

1289
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,820
he had a guy named Hitler that
that is saying that he's got,

1290
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,301
you know,

1291
00:40:52,301 --> 00:40:54,880
the master race it's going
to take over the world.

1292
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,200
Just starting that stuff was not
too far away from World War Two.

1293
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:04,830
And you've got all that stuff permeating
in the air and you got Louis fighting a

1294
00:41:06,221 --> 00:41:07,420
guy who of course,

1295
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:08,763
you know,

1296
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,800
propaganda was started by the Germans,

1297
00:41:11,801 --> 00:41:16,420
if you want almost to me almost invented
that word because you had to propaganda

1298
00:41:16,421 --> 00:41:20,440
minister and you had all these terrible
people with Hitler that we're putting

1299
00:41:20,441 --> 00:41:23,380
out to dare the master race to
this day that you had to judge.

1300
00:41:23,381 --> 00:41:24,850
You all win situation Olympics.

1301
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:25,420
Yeah.

1302
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:30,420
And now you had the biggest sport in
the biggest country and the champion of

1303
00:41:31,841 --> 00:41:34,820
that sport to heavyweight Joe Lewis.

1304
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:39,920
And he's fighting the German fighter
Schmeling the second time now for the

1305
00:41:39,921 --> 00:41:40,754
title.

1306
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,080
And of course you had

1307
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:49,300
Hitler and all his psycho fence
or these people that were,

1308
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,070
their job was to promote it,

1309
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,480
so to speak.

1310
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:55,550
And they come and they're saying,

1311
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,000
we will show the world that we're superior
and there's no better way to show it

1312
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:03,613
then in a ring.

1313
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:06,650
And so Lewis has to,

1314
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:09,111
he's got,

1315
00:42:09,111 --> 00:42:11,350
and he's got to carry all this stuff.

1316
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:12,401
I mean,

1317
00:42:12,401 --> 00:42:13,234
take about it.

1318
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:16,170
And he's a black Guy Kaci that,

1319
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:18,880
that he still can't go
into certain places,

1320
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:20,043
teat.

1321
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:22,690
And he's got to carry the whole,

1322
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:29,680
he's got to carry the whole country
and not let them down in the president

1323
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:30,550
because I didn't get,

1324
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,290
we don't know if there's
a legendary story,

1325
00:42:32,291 --> 00:42:33,640
we don't know if it's completely true,

1326
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:35,860
but supposedly the president
called him and said,

1327
00:42:35,861 --> 00:42:36,041
Joe,

1328
00:42:36,041 --> 00:42:38,830
you got to witness one for
the good guys that that's,

1329
00:42:38,831 --> 00:42:39,970
that's one of the legends.

1330
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:41,500
I don't know if it's true,

1331
00:42:41,501 --> 00:42:42,251
but I know of that.

1332
00:42:42,251 --> 00:42:43,300
I'm sure he corner,

1333
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:48,370
I'm sure we called them
and Louis has to go into,

1334
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:55,130
is kind of going to Yankee Stadium
outdoors and in Times Square in New York,

1335
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,480
they used to have it set up where they
would the radio because all the fight,

1336
00:43:02,481 --> 00:43:05,050
why radio back then and
some of them on fights,

1337
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:05,741
on TV,

1338
00:43:05,741 --> 00:43:06,260
on Gillette,

1339
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:06,630
Calvert,

1340
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:07,990
Keto sports and all that stuff.

1341
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:08,823
Friday night fights,

1342
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:09,850
but was,

1343
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:10,840
was coming along,

1344
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:11,500
you know,

1345
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:12,430
to start coming along.

1346
00:43:12,431 --> 00:43:14,380
But radio was the thing.

1347
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:19,990
And so in Times Square you had
to radio speakers outdoors,

1348
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:22,570
you know,

1349
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:23,620
playing a fight,

1350
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,120
podcasts in the fight.

1351
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:26,650
So people are out on the streets,

1352
00:43:26,651 --> 00:43:29,230
they hear the radio and he uh,

1353
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:29,740
you know,

1354
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:33,340
Joe Lewis is walking into
the ring and you know,

1355
00:43:33,341 --> 00:43:33,630
and,

1356
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:34,990
and you got Yankee Stadium,

1357
00:43:34,991 --> 00:43:39,991
you've got to place four and you've got
the whole world of everything I just

1358
00:43:40,301 --> 00:43:41,134
described.

1359
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:42,941
The good,

1360
00:43:42,941 --> 00:43:43,511
the bad,

1361
00:43:43,511 --> 00:43:44,021
the evil,

1362
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:44,560
the ugly,

1363
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,030
every thing.

1364
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,110
It's not a movie.

1365
00:43:47,111 --> 00:43:48,220
It's real life.

1366
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:54,300
And you got Joe Lewis and he gets in that
ring and he annihilates with all this

1367
00:43:55,301 --> 00:43:56,840
pressure with that,

1368
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:58,510
that he's got to save the,

1369
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:01,420
basically the United
States in a world from,

1370
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:05,110
from looking like this ugly

1371
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:08,150
scorge and,

1372
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:12,010
and disease of the Nazi party is,

1373
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,500
is going to take over.

1374
00:44:13,501 --> 00:44:18,501
The world is greater than us and he and
he single handedly has to prove that.

1375
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:21,293
And he,

1376
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:26,130
he goes into any annihilates the Chi in
one round with all that stuff hanging

1377
00:44:26,131 --> 00:44:26,730
over them.

1378
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:31,530
I think that's the greatest single
event in the history of world.

1379
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:33,003
Pull that fight out,

1380
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:33,631
pull out,

1381
00:44:33,631 --> 00:44:35,010
fight up and put it in the background.

1382
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:36,990
And I think that diet,

1383
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:39,000
when you talk about all the things,

1384
00:44:39,001 --> 00:44:40,290
the way here to talk about,

1385
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:42,270
about character,

1386
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:43,920
about talent,

1387
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,380
about perseverance,

1388
00:44:46,381 --> 00:44:47,460
about resiliency,

1389
00:44:47,461 --> 00:44:48,120
about,

1390
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,590
about caring,

1391
00:44:49,591 --> 00:44:51,090
about more than yourself,

1392
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,400
about selflessness,

1393
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,800
about strength,

1394
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:01,700
when you talk about all those things
that we try to say that we care about and

1395
00:45:02,341 --> 00:45:04,410
that we sometimes look to,

1396
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:05,573
to be,

1397
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:06,211
um,

1398
00:45:06,211 --> 00:45:07,800
very rarely can we be that

1399
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:12,250
he was all that he was all of that.

1400
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,740
And there it is right there.

1401
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:15,250
I mean,

1402
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:16,390
how great is that?

1403
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:18,520
And he stalked the guy,

1404
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,000
he stalked to guy and his punches
were short and powerful and he was the

1405
00:45:25,451 --> 00:45:29,080
greatest finish in the history
of heavyweight bouncing.

1406
00:45:29,081 --> 00:45:30,340
Because when he hurts you,

1407
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:32,320
you didn't survive.

1408
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:33,460
He got rid of you.

1409
00:45:33,461 --> 00:45:37,150
He put punches together and it was
short and he was always in position.

1410
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:38,440
Look at his legs.

1411
00:45:38,441 --> 00:45:39,580
He's always a position.

1412
00:45:39,581 --> 00:45:40,271
You move forward.

1413
00:45:40,271 --> 00:45:44,770
It takes a little stub fall back to get
yourself all those punches is absolutely

1414
00:45:44,771 --> 00:45:45,371
beautiful.

1415
00:45:45,371 --> 00:45:48,250
If you wanted to teach a young
fighter how to punch correctly,

1416
00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:49,330
Joe Louis,

1417
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:51,540
there's no better guy
to watch and Cholon oh,

1418
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:53,260
did you see Joe?

1419
00:45:53,261 --> 00:45:55,630
What he did a little minute ago.

1420
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:57,100
No a minute ago,

1421
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:58,010
smelling.

1422
00:45:58,010 --> 00:45:59,830
Tried to catch him with
that same right hand.

1423
00:45:59,831 --> 00:46:01,510
He had knocked him out two years earlier.

1424
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:02,320
Go back.

1425
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:03,310
They just missed it,

1426
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:04,870
but he changed.

1427
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:05,980
He stepped out.

1428
00:46:05,981 --> 00:46:09,880
He changed his distance this
time because jaggy Blackburn,

1429
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:11,500
who's a great fighter,

1430
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:12,760
a black fighter,

1431
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:13,821
he was a training.

1432
00:46:13,821 --> 00:46:17,800
It was a great train and nobody hears
about Jaggy Blackburn what a great fighter

1433
00:46:17,801 --> 00:46:21,940
he was and what a great trainee was and
how he wasn't allowed to fight white

1434
00:46:21,941 --> 00:46:22,720
fighters.

1435
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,040
And he beat everybody.

1436
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:24,850
Look at that.

1437
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:25,780
Cattle love talk.

1438
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:29,020
Instead of laying his head on the
right like he did the first fight,

1439
00:46:29,021 --> 00:46:31,930
he changed his range and he
made that right hand mess.

1440
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,060
I look how calm he is.

1441
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:35,410
Look how calm he is.

1442
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,210
Look how focused he is.

1443
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:39,741
It's beautiful.

1444
00:46:39,741 --> 00:46:41,720
Watch shortness of those punches.

1445
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:43,760
Phenomenal watches legs,

1446
00:46:43,761 --> 00:46:44,210
Joe.

1447
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:44,571
Watch.

1448
00:46:44,571 --> 00:46:46,310
Watch how he's always in position.

1449
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:47,173
Look at Atlanta.

1450
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:48,410
Well,

1451
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:49,250
what did we miss?

1452
00:46:49,251 --> 00:46:50,090
What didn't you see?

1453
00:46:50,091 --> 00:46:50,720
Go back.

1454
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:51,440
The sides don't.

1455
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,070
No.

1456
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:55,850
The Blinding Jab that we
don't see what the jam was.

1457
00:46:55,851 --> 00:46:56,710
Just a dick boy.

1458
00:46:57,110 --> 00:46:59,420
Just so we can hit it with
the right so you don't see it.

1459
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:00,313
Right.

1460
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:03,080
What a beautiful sidestep to right
after he lands the right hand.

1461
00:47:03,081 --> 00:47:03,914
Beautiful.

1462
00:47:04,010 --> 00:47:04,520
Right.

1463
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,590
Well that's why he's the
greatest finish of all time.

1464
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:07,671
Watch,

1465
00:47:07,671 --> 00:47:08,031
watch,

1466
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:09,260
way finishes this guy.

1467
00:47:09,261 --> 00:47:13,190
What it's going to go to the body
and the head right hand to the body.

1468
00:47:13,191 --> 00:47:14,240
Right ahead to the head.

1469
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:15,263
Oh,

1470
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:17,180
that is so short.

1471
00:47:17,181 --> 00:47:18,530
And even when he's got the guy hurt,

1472
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,370
look at the guy.

1473
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:19,881
Look at that.

1474
00:47:19,881 --> 00:47:20,714
Phenomenal,

1475
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:22,370
phenomenal.

1476
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:26,270
And he did all of that with everything
we just talked about for the last 20

1477
00:47:26,271 --> 00:47:26,990
minutes.

1478
00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:28,010
Hanging over him.

1479
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:28,873
Yeah.

1480
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:31,160
Oh,

1481
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,630
it's a giant piece of history
that people don't talk about it.

1482
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:35,190
Doesn't that make you think a little bit,

1483
00:47:35,191 --> 00:47:37,710
doesn't it make you
feel something about us?

1484
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:38,370
Really?

1485
00:47:38,370 --> 00:47:38,641
Yeah.

1486
00:47:38,641 --> 00:47:41,010
Well it's one of the reasons why
I'm a giants fan of the sport.

1487
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:41,550
Yeah.

1488
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:42,060
Thank you.

1489
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:42,341
I mean,

1490
00:47:42,341 --> 00:47:46,380
and that that alone is in terms
of like historical impact.

1491
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,041
I agree with you.

1492
00:47:47,041 --> 00:47:51,060
It's one of the biggest moments
in all of sports ever in life.

1493
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:51,923
In life.

1494
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,310
You know what I like about boxing?

1495
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:56,660
I like a lot things at all.

1496
00:47:56,661 --> 00:47:59,460
Like I don't like the administrators.

1497
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:00,313
I hate them.

1498
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:01,700
I know there's a powerful word,

1499
00:48:01,701 --> 00:48:02,900
but you know,

1500
00:48:02,901 --> 00:48:04,070
not every single one of them,

1501
00:48:04,071 --> 00:48:05,170
but I'm just saying I,

1502
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:06,023
I,

1503
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:07,490
I hate their weakness.

1504
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:09,200
I hate that cowardice.

1505
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,113
I do.

1506
00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:12,020
I do.

1507
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:13,430
Because they sit outside the ring.

1508
00:48:13,431 --> 00:48:14,030
A lot of them,

1509
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:15,200
you brought up a point,

1510
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,980
they should have had an experience one
way or the other and they've never ever

1511
00:48:18,981 --> 00:48:19,451
had anyone.

1512
00:48:19,451 --> 00:48:20,091
He punched him.

1513
00:48:20,091 --> 00:48:21,950
And I'm not saying you to be a man,

1514
00:48:21,951 --> 00:48:22,790
you got to get punched.

1515
00:48:22,791 --> 00:48:24,260
I'm not saying any of that stuff.

1516
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:26,510
It's being a man is a lot more than that.

1517
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:27,920
A lot more now.

1518
00:48:27,921 --> 00:48:29,960
Plenty of people get
punched and then I met.

1519
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:35,680
But what I'm saying is that you should
understand what it feels to a person to

1520
00:48:38,301 --> 00:48:43,220
put themselves on the line and to
risk so much and to risk everything

1521
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:47,750
to try to get their
family in a better place.

1522
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,250
I think there's also,

1523
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:53,030
they should be a fan and I don't
think some of them are even fans.

1524
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:53,181
No,

1525
00:48:53,181 --> 00:48:53,900
they're not.

1526
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:54,621
And in some of my,

1527
00:48:54,621 --> 00:48:55,490
not even like it,

1528
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:56,510
they wouldn't tell you that.

1529
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:57,140
Right.

1530
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:58,310
But they just do it for a job.

1531
00:48:58,340 --> 00:48:59,050
Yeah.

1532
00:48:59,050 --> 00:48:59,400
And,

1533
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,860
and what I'm saying is that

1534
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:03,800
when you,

1535
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,960
when I see these people
that haven't put them,

1536
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:08,630
been in that place and not
everyone can be in that place.

1537
00:49:08,631 --> 00:49:09,171
So again,

1538
00:49:09,171 --> 00:49:11,510
I gotta be careful with that
if I'm going to be fair,

1539
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:17,720
but for them so easily to take
something away from somebody,

1540
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:19,760
see what's different for me,

1541
00:49:19,761 --> 00:49:21,420
why I get passionate.

1542
00:49:21,421 --> 00:49:22,430
And if you want to use that word,

1543
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:23,181
people say Teddy,

1544
00:49:23,181 --> 00:49:24,410
you can get a little crazy

1545
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:30,800
if it happens in baseball and
the guy beats out to troll.

1546
00:49:30,830 --> 00:49:31,850
Now you have cameras.

1547
00:49:31,851 --> 00:49:33,140
So you didn't use half that.

1548
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:37,100
But if a guy you didn't
have replay back in the day,

1549
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:38,233
the guy,

1550
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,260
it happened a lot of times,

1551
00:49:39,261 --> 00:49:40,100
guy was safe and,

1552
00:49:40,101 --> 00:49:40,934
and call him out.

1553
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:42,080
You know what?

1554
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:42,610
Too Bad.

1555
00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:42,880
It's a,

1556
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:43,713
it's a shame,

1557
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:44,781
but you know what?

1558
00:49:44,781 --> 00:49:48,890
The next day he's going to play the game
again and he's going to be able to make

1559
00:49:48,891 --> 00:49:49,724
amends for that.

1560
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:52,670
He and his family and he's
got guaranteed contracts.

1561
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:55,100
And you know what it's going to be okay.

1562
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:55,730
I mean,

1563
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:56,563
was it right?

1564
00:49:56,690 --> 00:49:57,980
Wrong is never right.

1565
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,113
No,

1566
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:00,770
but you know what,

1567
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:04,700
in the mix of things
we could overcome that.

1568
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:06,410
But now you take a fighter,

1569
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:11,960
same thing and the judge judges
make a mistake maybe on purpose,

1570
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:12,770
whatever,

1571
00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:16,010
but they make a bad mistake to fight.

1572
00:50:16,011 --> 00:50:19,130
It can't go back the next day and
rectify that to fight it doesn't have a

1573
00:50:19,131 --> 00:50:20,150
guaranteed contract.

1574
00:50:20,151 --> 00:50:22,820
He only has what he can make
if he gets to that fight.

1575
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,010
That's it for that night.

1576
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:26,720
Cause where that fight a goals,

1577
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:27,980
he go back to the

1578
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:32,980
dug out and then come out the next day
and play again with a new uniform on.

1579
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:38,680
Now he goes to the back of the line
and boxing and has to take hundreds,

1580
00:50:38,901 --> 00:50:42,470
maybe thousands of punches
to get back to that place.

1581
00:50:42,471 --> 00:50:47,471
He was to earn the right to get closer
to the exit in a business because

1582
00:50:48,321 --> 00:50:49,640
everyone's trying to get to the exit.

1583
00:50:49,970 --> 00:50:54,800
They're trying to gain what they can
gain but their legacy with for their

1584
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:55,634
families,

1585
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:59,510
for themselves in many ways financially,

1586
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:00,081
you know,

1587
00:51:00,081 --> 00:51:00,650
and,

1588
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:01,460
and,

1589
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:05,810
but also what's inside them that they,

1590
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:07,640
that they have to prove something,

1591
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:13,420
that they have to make it
for all different personal
reasons and they're close

1592
00:51:13,521 --> 00:51:17,750
to doing that and now they're
forced because of some crock.

1593
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:19,490
Maybe it's incompetence,

1594
00:51:19,491 --> 00:51:21,230
it either corruption and incompetence.

1595
00:51:21,231 --> 00:51:22,064
Okay.

1596
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:26,660
But sometimes it's corruption and they
have to go all the way to the back of the

1597
00:51:26,661 --> 00:51:26,900
line.

1598
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:30,320
Now then I'm playing a
football game the next Sunday,

1599
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:36,050
then I play in an NBA game two days later
and they got to take all those punches

1600
00:51:37,131 --> 00:51:37,970
and hope,

1601
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:39,493
hope

1602
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:42,320
they get back to that place.

1603
00:51:42,830 --> 00:51:43,520
And you know what?

1604
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,360
I seen it.

1605
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:48,080
I did 22 years of ESPN boxing.

1606
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:49,850
I've been with ESPN about 22 years,

1607
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:51,410
but I did like 18 years,

1608
00:51:51,411 --> 00:51:52,041
whatever it was,

1609
00:51:52,041 --> 00:51:53,060
a Friday night fights.

1610
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:55,430
We did a lot of title fights.

1611
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:56,900
Not to big names,

1612
00:51:56,901 --> 00:51:58,070
not to Canelo's,

1613
00:51:58,071 --> 00:51:58,700
not,

1614
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:00,050
not to go off gins,

1615
00:52:00,051 --> 00:52:01,220
not the Mayweathers.

1616
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:05,480
What guys that had mentors as much
to even more because they didn't have

1617
00:52:05,481 --> 00:52:10,481
millions of dollars and they got this
shot and I watched them get robbed

1618
00:52:12,290 --> 00:52:14,240
and I saw that they never got back there.

1619
00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:16,760
That night was the right night for them.

1620
00:52:16,761 --> 00:52:18,260
That particular night,

1621
00:52:18,261 --> 00:52:19,370
everything worked.

1622
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:21,170
Everything was perfect,

1623
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:22,790
all that training,

1624
00:52:22,791 --> 00:52:26,690
everything came together
and they were beautiful.

1625
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:29,450
They were magnificent and
they were freaking robbed

1626
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:31,783
and it's wrong.

1627
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:33,110
It's really wrong.

1628
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:35,960
And that's what they do when they do that.

1629
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,400
But the glorious thing
of if that's not too

1630
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:42,290
made up of a word,

1631
00:52:42,291 --> 00:52:43,330
it sounds like glory.

1632
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:48,670
But the beautiful thing about boxing is
that with everything wrong in the world,

1633
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:55,040
and I hate to use this cliche,

1634
00:52:55,041 --> 00:52:55,880
this terminology,

1635
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:58,550
but you know with life being unfair,

1636
00:52:58,551 --> 00:53:00,500
because I don't like to use that because,

1637
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,840
because sometimes people nowadays,

1638
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:03,703
for me,

1639
00:53:04,370 --> 00:53:05,840
there's too many excuses out there.

1640
00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:06,650
There really are.

1641
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:08,240
There's too many damn excuses.

1642
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:09,321
You're in this country,

1643
00:53:09,321 --> 00:53:13,010
you got a chance to do something
where you don't have in other places.

1644
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:16,190
But having said that,

1645
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:18,710
he can feel like life's
not fair sometimes,

1646
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:23,030
especially when you think about some of
the things we just talked about in a day

1647
00:53:23,031 --> 00:53:23,811
that's gone now.

1648
00:53:23,811 --> 00:53:24,740
It's not there no more.

1649
00:53:24,741 --> 00:53:25,380
But,

1650
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:25,621
well,

1651
00:53:25,621 --> 00:53:26,400
Dave Lewis

1652
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,540
and all those kind of people,

1653
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:28,740
life was unfair.

1654
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:33,060
That really they really had a
right to use that say nowadays,

1655
00:53:33,061 --> 00:53:34,980
I don't think people have of white,

1656
00:53:34,981 --> 00:53:35,401
black,

1657
00:53:35,401 --> 00:53:36,234
purple,

1658
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:39,930
they don't have a right to say that
to the extent that they did back then.

1659
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:40,680
Not to the extent,

1660
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:40,940
no,

1661
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:41,160
no,

1662
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:41,760
they don't.

1663
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,130
They really lose all the things
wrong or they're messed up.

1664
00:53:44,131 --> 00:53:45,090
People still out there.

1665
00:53:45,091 --> 00:53:45,600
Yeah,

1666
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:45,991
yeah,

1667
00:53:45,991 --> 00:53:46,411
yeah,

1668
00:53:46,411 --> 00:53:46,771
yeah,

1669
00:53:46,771 --> 00:53:47,604
yeah.

1670
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:50,880
But sometimes it's too easy to use that.

1671
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:51,260
Yes.

1672
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:52,210
It's just too easy.

1673
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:53,813
So,

1674
00:53:54,090 --> 00:53:57,420
but there was a time when
life too often was unfair.

1675
00:53:57,570 --> 00:53:58,480
Ruthlessly unfair.

1676
00:53:58,740 --> 00:53:59,580
Really unfair.

1677
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:00,480
Ruthlessly.

1678
00:54:00,481 --> 00:54:01,070
Yeah,

1679
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:01,903
yeah,

1680
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:02,793
yeah.

1681
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:05,433
Okay.

1682
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:08,460
And when life was unfair,

1683
00:54:08,461 --> 00:54:10,740
boxing was around to make it fair.

1684
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:11,693
And I'll tell you how

1685
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,190
on one given night,

1686
00:54:16,930 --> 00:54:18,220
if you worked hard enough,

1687
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:21,460
if you dream big enough,

1688
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:25,810
if you were tough enough and
you made yourself tough enough,

1689
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:27,670
you sacrificed enough,

1690
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:32,260
you became polished and savvy enough.

1691
00:54:32,261 --> 00:54:35,320
And and technically

1692
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:42,240
equipped to do things that you had and
you learn those things and you just work

1693
00:54:42,341 --> 00:54:43,510
yourself to the ball.

1694
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:46,530
No matter where you came from,

1695
00:54:46,531 --> 00:54:48,420
no matter what part of the world,

1696
00:54:48,421 --> 00:54:48,841
no matter what,

1697
00:54:48,841 --> 00:54:49,700
who your parents were,

1698
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:51,990
no matter what your poverty
level may have been,

1699
00:54:51,991 --> 00:54:52,824
may not have been,

1700
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:54,900
no matter what you had,

1701
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:55,381
would,

1702
00:54:55,381 --> 00:54:56,214
you didn't have,

1703
00:54:56,910 --> 00:54:58,970
no matter what people had told you,

1704
00:54:58,971 --> 00:55:00,900
I didn't tell you

1705
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:03,653
all of that.

1706
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:09,090
If you made yourself and took advantage
of that opportunity and get yourself

1707
00:55:09,091 --> 00:55:09,924
ready

1708
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:15,160
and you were ready to
behave like a champion,

1709
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:22,020
you could get in that ring on one given
night and make the world fair and have

1710
00:55:23,621 --> 00:55:24,460
your hand lifted,

1711
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:29,740
heavy call champion of the
world that makes boxes special.

1712
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:32,950
And that's what these judges don't get,

1713
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:39,770
that kids are waiting to hear
that and they give everything,

1714
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:41,541
you know,

1715
00:55:41,541 --> 00:55:42,860
you hear too much to crap.

1716
00:55:42,861 --> 00:55:46,430
Where I would dive for that was
people that would die for that.

1717
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:49,940
So have people in our times in his world,

1718
00:55:49,941 --> 00:55:50,774
in his country,

1719
00:55:51,530 --> 00:55:53,270
and you use the right world word,

1720
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:54,290
you know,

1721
00:55:54,290 --> 00:55:54,921
tragically,

1722
00:55:54,921 --> 00:55:57,880
whatever powerful word you
had just shows ruthlessly.

1723
00:55:58,670 --> 00:55:59,330
Yeah,

1724
00:55:59,330 --> 00:55:59,600
yeah.

1725
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:01,760
There were people because of that word,

1726
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:06,530
because of the reality of the
actions attached to that world word.

1727
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:10,011
If you told them,

1728
00:56:10,011 --> 00:56:11,150
listen you,

1729
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:12,970
you got to you,

1730
00:56:12,971 --> 00:56:14,060
you're going to have to die,

1731
00:56:14,061 --> 00:56:15,140
you know after this,

1732
00:56:15,141 --> 00:56:16,610
but you'll get to have this,

1733
00:56:16,611 --> 00:56:17,840
your hand will be lifted.

1734
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:22,400
You will be called champion of the
world or your people will see it and the

1735
00:56:22,401 --> 00:56:25,450
people you want see it and yourself,

1736
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:29,710
but your die afterwards
I would give you that.

1737
00:56:29,711 --> 00:56:30,670
People would sign on.

1738
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:33,130
That's how important that was.

1739
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:38,550
That's what that stood for and then you
get judges that have no conception of

1740
00:56:39,371 --> 00:56:40,204
that.

1741
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:42,640
I don't mean to laugh,

1742
00:56:42,641 --> 00:56:43,460
but no,

1743
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:46,150
I learned saying they have to
have a complete conception of it,

1744
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:49,630
but no feeling of what
we're talking about.

1745
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:51,700
I think they're like DMV workers.

1746
00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:52,581
That's what I think.

1747
00:56:52,581 --> 00:56:54,290
I think there's a bunch of
them that are real good,

1748
00:56:54,291 --> 00:56:57,050
but a lot of them are just like people
that had just taken a government job.

1749
00:56:58,250 --> 00:56:58,910
That's what I think.

1750
00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:01,190
And I think it's a travesty
that they're not removed.

1751
00:57:01,310 --> 00:57:04,640
That's what I think when
whenever I go to a UFC and it,

1752
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:05,300
like I said,

1753
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:05,811
a lot of it,

1754
00:57:05,811 --> 00:57:06,644
the same judges,

1755
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:08,350
and I see some of these,

1756
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:09,303
these scores,

1757
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:14,030
I want to take my fucking headset off
and throw it into the cage and scream and

1758
00:57:14,031 --> 00:57:15,290
flip over the table.

1759
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:19,340
And you just kind of take a deep breath
and calm yourself down because there's

1760
00:57:19,341 --> 00:57:20,210
nothing you can do.

1761
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,100
And these athletic commissions have kept,

1762
00:57:22,101 --> 00:57:23,990
kept these people on for whatever reason.

1763
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:25,580
And you're watching a bad decision.

1764
00:57:25,581 --> 00:57:27,740
You watched someone who trained for eight,

1765
00:57:27,741 --> 00:57:30,860
10 weeks for this one particular fight
in years and years to get to that

1766
00:57:30,861 --> 00:57:31,520
position.

1767
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:34,490
And they're getting fucked and the getting
fucked because someone just sucks at

1768
00:57:34,491 --> 00:57:36,020
their job and they don't care.

1769
00:57:36,021 --> 00:57:36,854
And this person,

1770
00:57:36,990 --> 00:57:37,301
they,

1771
00:57:37,301 --> 00:57:37,640
they,

1772
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:40,280
they're going to be there two
months from now at another fight.

1773
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,200
And there's nothing you can do about it.

1774
00:57:42,201 --> 00:57:43,220
And I don't understand it.

1775
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:45,260
I don't understand how the
commissions let this slide.

1776
00:57:45,470 --> 00:57:48,140
I don't know how difficult it is to
fire these people would approve they're

1777
00:57:48,141 --> 00:57:48,974
incompetent.

1778
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:52,310
But I do know that especially with with,

1779
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:53,161
oh,

1780
00:57:53,161 --> 00:57:55,670
I guess it's probably true
with both boxing and MMA,

1781
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,650
there are countless fans out there.

1782
00:57:57,651 --> 00:57:59,120
They would do a far better job,

1783
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:00,313
countless,

1784
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:01,460
countless people that have,

1785
00:58:01,461 --> 00:58:06,320
have experienced in fighting countless
people that have a deep appreciation and

1786
00:58:06,321 --> 00:58:08,870
understanding of what's actually
going on inside the fight.

1787
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,240
And these people don't get those jobs.

1788
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:16,540
And instead the same fools continue
to give piss poor decisions or corrupt

1789
00:58:17,271 --> 00:58:18,104
decisions.

1790
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:18,501
I mean,

1791
00:58:18,501 --> 00:58:19,520
whoever that woman was,

1792
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:19,990
you know,

1793
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:22,070
there's mention people's names,

1794
00:58:22,071 --> 00:58:23,480
but there's been some decisions,

1795
00:58:23,510 --> 00:58:25,010
there's been some horrific

1796
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:27,250
headed for with the Mayweather.

1797
00:58:27,310 --> 00:58:28,100
Uh,

1798
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:31,310
you told him about the
Mayweather Canelo yes.

1799
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:33,770
The woman had had in a drawer.

1800
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:34,693
Yes.

1801
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:35,510
What?

1802
00:58:35,510 --> 00:58:35,951
I'm not going to,

1803
00:58:35,951 --> 00:58:36,561
I know a name,

1804
00:58:36,561 --> 00:58:37,394
but I'm not going to

1805
00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:39,860
her name either because
she was also involved in,

1806
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:40,250
uh,

1807
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:41,340
another one was it?

1808
00:58:41,590 --> 00:58:41,801
Yeah,

1809
00:58:41,801 --> 00:58:42,760
she got Tony Brown,

1810
00:58:43,010 --> 00:58:43,510
I think.

1811
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:44,410
Manny Pacquiao.

1812
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:45,520
Yeah.

1813
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,720
She was involved in a couple.

1814
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:47,613
Yeah,

1815
00:58:47,770 --> 00:58:48,680
a couple.

1816
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:49,900
At least two.

1817
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:51,460
I think we're being,

1818
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:53,260
we're being responsible.

1819
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:54,730
Um,

1820
00:58:54,730 --> 00:58:55,690
why was she still there?

1821
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:56,703
Right.

1822
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:57,573
Seriously.

1823
00:58:57,670 --> 00:58:59,040
Why was she still that?

1824
00:58:59,070 --> 00:58:59,550
Why?

1825
00:58:59,550 --> 00:59:00,040
Yeah,

1826
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:00,311
why?

1827
00:59:00,311 --> 00:59:01,480
Why was she still there?

1828
00:59:01,481 --> 00:59:02,314
I mean,

1829
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:06,650
we're not talking about
neurosurgeon said really,

1830
00:59:06,990 --> 00:59:07,261
right.

1831
00:59:07,261 --> 00:59:08,220
We're talking about a job.

1832
00:59:08,221 --> 00:59:09,660
There's a lot of people that could do it.

1833
00:59:10,410 --> 00:59:11,760
I'm not saying it's an easy job,

1834
00:59:11,761 --> 00:59:13,620
but I'm saying there's a
lot of people that are,

1835
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:15,390
have a real understanding of boxing.

1836
00:59:15,530 --> 00:59:17,070
They would have done a way better job.

1837
00:59:17,110 --> 00:59:17,411
I mean,

1838
00:59:17,411 --> 00:59:18,370
somebody robs a bank.

1839
00:59:18,371 --> 00:59:20,020
They're not your bank
teller the next week.

1840
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:22,093
Exactly.

1841
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:23,263
Exactly.

1842
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:24,300
Well,

1843
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:24,450
yeah,

1844
00:59:24,450 --> 00:59:26,450
that'll all the promoters
today is golden boy.

1845
00:59:26,451 --> 00:59:27,050
The best.

1846
00:59:27,050 --> 00:59:27,321
I mean,

1847
00:59:27,321 --> 00:59:28,640
at least Oscar de la Jolla,

1848
00:59:28,641 --> 00:59:29,540
Bernard Hopkins,

1849
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:32,000
they're legit world champion fighters.

1850
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:33,850
They have a deal,

1851
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:35,510
but they're attached to,

1852
00:59:35,511 --> 00:59:36,200
they got one.

1853
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,940
They got to strengthen and got a weakness.

1854
00:59:37,941 --> 00:59:38,820
That weakness is,

1855
00:59:39,050 --> 00:59:42,350
they attached really
attached at the hip to one,

1856
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:43,330
you know,

1857
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:44,270
the solar system,

1858
00:59:44,271 --> 00:59:44,931
so to speak,

1859
00:59:44,931 --> 00:59:47,960
has one son and I sign is called Canelo,

1860
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:51,140
but Canelo disappears
tomorrow and they're fucked.

1861
00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:52,543
Yeah.

1862
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,193
They're not happy.

1863
00:59:54,370 --> 00:59:55,220
They've got some problems.

1864
00:59:55,221 --> 00:59:56,570
But listen now,

1865
00:59:56,571 --> 00:59:57,470
Hayman's out there,

1866
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:58,311
you know,

1867
00:59:58,311 --> 00:59:58,720
he,

1868
00:59:58,720 --> 00:59:59,660
he's PBC.

1869
00:59:59,710 --> 00:59:59,990
You know,

1870
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:00,823
he came along,

1871
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:01,850
um,

1872
01:00:01,850 --> 01:00:04,100
he just signed a deal from what I read.

1873
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:05,293
Um,

1874
01:00:05,450 --> 01:00:09,320
I think I'm saying the numbers right
where Fox gave him $50 million for a four

1875
01:00:09,321 --> 01:00:11,570
year deal to put fights out there,

1876
01:00:11,571 --> 01:00:14,840
and he's probably got the
best stable of fighters.

1877
01:00:14,841 --> 01:00:15,021
I mean,

1878
01:00:15,021 --> 01:00:16,250
he's a,

1879
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:18,140
he's got what the guy
hasn't been fine but took,

1880
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:18,983
I was,

1881
01:00:19,010 --> 01:00:20,360
I think was one of the best guys.

1882
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:21,193
Thurman.

1883
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:22,253
Um,

1884
01:00:22,550 --> 01:00:23,510
but you know,

1885
01:00:23,511 --> 01:00:25,280
he's got who I really loved.

1886
01:00:25,281 --> 01:00:26,150
His guy's a beast.

1887
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:27,080
My son loves him.

1888
01:00:27,430 --> 01:00:29,050
A Spence arose fans.

1889
01:00:29,570 --> 01:00:30,351
He's a beast.

1890
01:00:30,351 --> 01:00:30,621
I mean,

1891
01:00:30,621 --> 01:00:31,130
the guy,

1892
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:32,630
I like him inside and out.

1893
01:00:32,631 --> 01:00:33,470
What do I mean by that?

1894
01:00:33,471 --> 01:00:34,010
I mean,

1895
01:00:34,010 --> 01:00:36,680
he truly believes that he
should fight all the best.

1896
01:00:36,830 --> 01:00:38,240
He truly believes he's the best.

1897
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:40,010
He truly believes he's
going to get to you.

1898
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:41,053
You know what I mean?

1899
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:42,350
And any fights that way.

1900
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:43,250
And he's a great guy.

1901
01:00:43,730 --> 01:00:44,563
He's a good guy.

1902
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:45,493
He's a good guy.

1903
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:46,720
So it's,

1904
01:00:46,721 --> 01:00:47,041
it's clear.

1905
01:00:47,041 --> 01:00:47,730
Articulate.

1906
01:00:47,730 --> 01:00:48,440
Yeah.

1907
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:49,190
It makes it better.

1908
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:49,341
Yeah.

1909
01:00:49,341 --> 01:00:49,851
He's fun.

1910
01:00:49,851 --> 01:00:50,684
Got a big smile.

1911
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:50,991
Yeah.

1912
01:00:50,991 --> 01:00:51,380
Yeah.

1913
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:52,120
It's better.

1914
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:52,940
You know,

1915
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,210
Terrence Crawford is another one.

1916
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:55,160
I'll try it.

1917
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:57,590
And so,

1918
01:00:57,980 --> 01:00:59,650
I mean haven's got a lotta,

1919
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:01,710
he's also got wilder
and heavyweight champ,

1920
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:02,720
but one of the champs,

1921
01:01:02,721 --> 01:01:03,554
whatever that is.

1922
01:01:03,590 --> 01:01:05,180
But what a,

1923
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:07,400
technically he's got a lot of problems,

1924
01:01:07,401 --> 01:01:11,870
but he's kind of one thing that's
not a problem and confidence.

1925
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:12,733
But one other thing,

1926
01:01:12,830 --> 01:01:13,670
oh my goodness.

1927
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:15,433
He's thought

1928
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:19,840
instead of a hammer,

1929
01:01:19,841 --> 01:01:20,674
it's the right hand.

1930
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:24,320
Oh my goodness.

1931
01:01:24,321 --> 01:01:24,800
He,

1932
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:26,690
oh listen,

1933
01:01:26,691 --> 01:01:28,090
I mother fucker knocks everybody,

1934
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:28,641
man.

1935
01:01:28,641 --> 01:01:28,911
He,

1936
01:01:28,911 --> 01:01:29,750
if he hits you,

1937
01:01:29,751 --> 01:01:30,110
uh,

1938
01:01:30,110 --> 01:01:31,940
and the Ortiz fight was very interesting.

1939
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:32,983
He was hurt,

1940
01:01:33,450 --> 01:01:37,070
he was in bad shape and still referee
might have helped him a little,

1941
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:38,270
but he was in bad shape.

1942
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:39,553
And uh,

1943
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:40,611
but boy,

1944
01:01:40,611 --> 01:01:41,444
oh boy hill,

1945
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:41,900
you know,

1946
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:44,000
I say it a lot of times
he had that eraser,

1947
01:01:44,001 --> 01:01:44,480
you know,

1948
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:45,313
I remember,

1949
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:48,410
I remember I was not a great memory,

1950
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:49,610
but as a kid,

1951
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:53,720
somehow I wound up in a
Catholic school for a minute.

1952
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:55,640
And those nuns,

1953
01:01:57,340 --> 01:01:57,830
they,

1954
01:01:57,830 --> 01:01:58,940
they should have been fighters.

1955
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:02,083
They were mean.

1956
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:03,710
They were mean.

1957
01:02:03,770 --> 01:02:05,240
I think they were a little twisted.

1958
01:02:05,241 --> 01:02:07,190
Some of them but I'm not going to go to,

1959
01:02:07,191 --> 01:02:08,930
but they were little they would mean,

1960
01:02:09,290 --> 01:02:12,680
but they had no problem hitting you
in the head with that black racer.

1961
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:14,420
Like you won't Pay Bang.

1962
01:02:14,421 --> 01:02:15,200
It just like,

1963
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:15,951
and it was hard.

1964
01:02:15,951 --> 01:02:16,431
It was like,

1965
01:02:16,431 --> 01:02:16,820
I don't,

1966
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:18,800
that's what I'm fine.

1967
01:02:19,890 --> 01:02:20,730
You know.

1968
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:22,820
And he has that eraser.

1969
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:27,630
He has done a razor where
bank put his technique,

1970
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:31,620
his feet come up on the tone,

1971
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:33,540
take the bear lands technique,

1972
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:34,430
bed power,

1973
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:35,420
good Sherlock log,

1974
01:02:35,421 --> 01:02:36,254
boom.

1975
01:02:36,290 --> 01:02:36,780
Really?

1976
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:37,441
And he lands,

1977
01:02:37,441 --> 01:02:38,400
people go flying.

1978
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:39,383
I mean,

1979
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:41,590
and he of a giant heavyweight
either in terms of his,

1980
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:43,070
but you know what he is though.

1981
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:46,770
He's long and he's tall and
he looked at those arms.

1982
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:47,820
He was long.

1983
01:02:47,821 --> 01:02:48,470
I mean he could,

1984
01:02:48,470 --> 01:02:51,450
if he was in here he could
hit your cost as well.

1985
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:54,840
So Tyson fury and that's one of the
things that makes this fight very,

1986
01:02:54,910 --> 01:02:56,190
very interesting.

1987
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:59,750
That's one of the times where
that's saying styles make fights.

1988
01:02:59,751 --> 01:03:00,270
That's gonna.

1989
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:01,350
That's going to be this fight.

1990
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:02,870
That's going to be the whole thing.

1991
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:04,680
Tyson fury as a motherfucker.

1992
01:03:04,770 --> 01:03:04,921
Well,

1993
01:03:04,921 --> 01:03:06,660
he could move not only six,

1994
01:03:06,661 --> 01:03:07,860
seven or whatever the hell he is,

1995
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:09,601
six,

1996
01:03:09,601 --> 01:03:10,434
eight,

1997
01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:10,890
six,

1998
01:03:10,890 --> 01:03:11,790
nine long.

1999
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:12,940
But he could move his,

2000
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:13,720
each had legs.

2001
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:14,553
Phenomenal.

2002
01:03:14,990 --> 01:03:17,550
Somebody forgot to tell me he's a
heavyweight because he moves around like a

2003
01:03:17,551 --> 01:03:21,360
lightweight and that could be
a problem until he gets hit.

2004
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:21,751
Also,

2005
01:03:21,751 --> 01:03:23,790
it talks tremendous shit until he gets it.

2006
01:03:24,330 --> 01:03:26,100
Well then things change.

2007
01:03:26,490 --> 01:03:30,430
But I always used to say when
I was doing the broadcast,

2008
01:03:30,690 --> 01:03:31,650
I would always say,

2009
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:33,990
and I,

2010
01:03:33,990 --> 01:03:34,411
of course,

2011
01:03:34,411 --> 01:03:37,230
I wouldn't say it if I didn't
have a belief in us and,

2012
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:38,580
and the proof of it,

2013
01:03:38,581 --> 01:03:43,170
in my mind at least that
punches are born then I made,

2014
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:43,680
yeah,

2015
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:44,580
you're born or you're,

2016
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:46,710
you're not born to be
a punch of that level.

2017
01:03:46,770 --> 01:03:47,603
You just talk.

2018
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:48,870
And I'll tell you something funny that,

2019
01:03:48,871 --> 01:03:51,330
because you brought it up about him being,

2020
01:03:51,331 --> 01:03:51,571
you know,

2021
01:03:51,571 --> 01:03:52,260
he's not a big,

2022
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:52,531
you know,

2023
01:03:52,531 --> 01:03:55,980
he's not that prototypical big Husky,

2024
01:03:55,981 --> 01:03:56,814
you know,

2025
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:57,833
uh,

2026
01:03:57,990 --> 01:03:58,291
you know,

2027
01:03:58,291 --> 01:03:59,124
wedge style.

2028
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:00,600
Yeah.

2029
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:01,433
He's not that.

2030
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:04,920
But I'll tell you when
I was training fighters,

2031
01:04:04,921 --> 01:04:08,070
when I was young and I was taking
them to smokers in the Bronx to get

2032
01:04:08,071 --> 01:04:08,904
experience,

2033
01:04:09,310 --> 01:04:09,600
uh,

2034
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:10,433
every week,

2035
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:12,450
tough places in the South Bronx,

2036
01:04:12,690 --> 01:04:15,000
and we were taking them to these
unsanctioned fights just to get them

2037
01:04:15,001 --> 01:04:15,834
experience.

2038
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:18,160
And if I didn't know the fight,

2039
01:04:18,161 --> 01:04:18,780
I say I have,

2040
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:21,330
I'm responsible for these kids back then.

2041
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:22,650
I'm like their parent.

2042
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:23,610
And that trusted me.

2043
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:25,230
Some of them didn't have parents,

2044
01:04:25,231 --> 01:04:26,070
but the ones that did,

2045
01:04:26,071 --> 01:04:27,630
they would trust in me
to take care of this kid.

2046
01:04:27,870 --> 01:04:29,580
They didn't know what was
going to the South Bronx where,

2047
01:04:30,030 --> 01:04:30,241
where,

2048
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:33,260
I remember one time I
borrowed a car from somebody,

2049
01:04:33,261 --> 01:04:34,620
they didn't have to cut enough car.

2050
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:36,390
It was the publisher of the newspaper,

2051
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:39,330
the Catskill Daily Mail.

2052
01:04:39,630 --> 01:04:40,463
And,

2053
01:04:40,770 --> 01:04:42,660
and I've gone through is
the name and the publisher.

2054
01:04:42,870 --> 01:04:44,460
And I bought his station wagon.

2055
01:04:44,461 --> 01:04:46,470
I didn't have a car pick
enough to take the kids.

2056
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:47,633
And um,

2057
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:48,931
as I'm leaving,

2058
01:04:48,931 --> 01:04:49,764
he says,

2059
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:52,870
you're not taking a real bad place
where they'd like rob hubcaps.

2060
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:53,580
So something.

2061
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:54,271
And I was like,

2062
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:54,810
no,

2063
01:04:54,810 --> 01:04:57,780
because I didn't think I was lying
because to me they brought the whole car.

2064
01:05:02,210 --> 01:05:02,860
So,

2065
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:03,693
so I said no,

2066
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:05,480
because he left it at hubcaps.

2067
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:05,820
Right.

2068
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:06,670
So I said no.

2069
01:05:08,570 --> 01:05:11,150
So I get there in the first
thing I did those Ipos,

2070
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:11,461
the,

2071
01:05:11,461 --> 01:05:11,731
you know,

2072
01:05:11,731 --> 01:05:13,260
underneath the l you know,

2073
01:05:13,350 --> 01:05:17,680
for people don't know is to train subway
in the train and I underneath and,

2074
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:18,963
and uh,

2075
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:19,451
that was,

2076
01:05:19,451 --> 01:05:20,950
you talk about life grown up quick.

2077
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:23,080
You in one night,

2078
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:27,370
it was like live reading chapters of a
book to you went through different things

2079
01:05:27,371 --> 01:05:31,150
and you learn different things about
yourself and about what's there,

2080
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:32,440
what you don't see.

2081
01:05:33,090 --> 01:05:33,700
Uh,

2082
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:34,570
you haven't been around,

2083
01:05:34,571 --> 01:05:39,540
but it's there and it's good to know
it's there a different life to different

2084
01:05:39,550 --> 01:05:40,383
way.

2085
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:41,980
And I'm down in the South Bronx and,

2086
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:43,720
and our first thing I did,

2087
01:05:43,721 --> 01:05:44,830
I went to Mrs. Santos,

2088
01:05:44,831 --> 01:05:45,700
who was the father,

2089
01:05:45,701 --> 01:05:46,534
one of my kids.

2090
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:47,530
I went to his ball,

2091
01:05:47,531 --> 01:05:48,310
cross the street,

2092
01:05:48,310 --> 01:05:48,760
submissive,

2093
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:49,090
central,

2094
01:05:49,090 --> 01:05:50,050
my cars over there.

2095
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:51,273
Gotcha.

2096
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:52,990
And why come out?

2097
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:55,390
And all the batteries of the
cars were client accept mine

2098
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:57,933
quite often.

2099
01:05:58,390 --> 01:05:58,721
And,

2100
01:05:58,721 --> 01:05:59,554
uh,

2101
01:05:59,590 --> 01:06:00,520
but my car was good.

2102
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:04,810
That's the Santos and his crew made
sure that nobody took my battery.

2103
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:07,120
And so we were good.

2104
01:06:07,510 --> 01:06:10,390
So I was looking out for the kids
because I did what I had to do,

2105
01:06:10,391 --> 01:06:11,470
but it was a scary place.

2106
01:06:11,470 --> 01:06:12,400
It was a tough place.

2107
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:13,773
And um,

2108
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:14,780
the kids grew up fast.

2109
01:06:14,781 --> 01:06:19,480
If it was three flights and it was often
thought that it was meant to be three

2110
01:06:19,481 --> 01:06:22,060
flights because she had time
to think during those flights.

2111
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:22,841
The first flight,

2112
01:06:22,841 --> 01:06:23,651
quite frankly,

2113
01:06:23,651 --> 01:06:26,080
are you saw syringes,

2114
01:06:26,770 --> 01:06:29,780
sometimes kids didn't know
non buddies' kids will care.

2115
01:06:29,781 --> 01:06:30,614
It's going to New York,

2116
01:06:30,630 --> 01:06:32,980
they really syringes

2117
01:06:35,410 --> 01:06:35,711
then.

2118
01:06:35,711 --> 01:06:36,490
Then the next flight,

2119
01:06:36,490 --> 01:06:36,911
you know,

2120
01:06:36,911 --> 01:06:39,490
you smelled urine because
people were there.

2121
01:06:39,491 --> 01:06:40,660
They went up there and they were,

2122
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:41,290
you know,

2123
01:06:41,290 --> 01:06:42,160
going to bathroom,

2124
01:06:42,161 --> 01:06:46,150
doing whatever and shooting
up or whatever and you smell.

2125
01:06:47,110 --> 01:06:48,850
But then by the time
you get to dirt flight,

2126
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:51,010
you've started to hear noise,

2127
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:53,350
started to hear salsa music

2128
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:55,940
and you,

2129
01:06:55,941 --> 01:06:56,590
uh,

2130
01:06:56,590 --> 01:06:57,580
you could smell some.

2131
01:06:58,270 --> 01:06:58,661
There were,

2132
01:06:58,661 --> 01:07:00,850
they were cooking all
the Spanish specialties,

2133
01:07:01,570 --> 01:07:04,240
the A to five bananas,

2134
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:06,093
the uh,

2135
01:07:06,730 --> 01:07:07,800
the meeting with the,

2136
01:07:08,450 --> 01:07:12,000
with the potato in the middle
plantaris and all that.

2137
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:12,760
I remember,

2138
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:13,060
you know,

2139
01:07:13,060 --> 01:07:14,110
I don't remember all the names,

2140
01:07:14,111 --> 01:07:16,090
but all the different inn of course,

2141
01:07:16,510 --> 01:07:17,343
a lot of room,

2142
01:07:18,030 --> 01:07:18,863
a lot of,

2143
01:07:19,220 --> 01:07:20,053
there was a bar,

2144
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:21,910
but that's how they kept,

2145
01:07:21,911 --> 01:07:25,480
that's how they paid the rent for the
gym because they would do these smokers

2146
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:26,373
twice a month.

2147
01:07:26,890 --> 01:07:27,101
You know,

2148
01:07:27,101 --> 01:07:28,930
there was a smoke every week in New York.

2149
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:29,711
Every week.

2150
01:07:29,711 --> 01:07:31,000
People had to know where they were,

2151
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:32,830
but they were every week.

2152
01:07:33,310 --> 01:07:33,851
And Leah,

2153
01:07:33,851 --> 01:07:35,800
they won't sanction and
there was no doctrine.

2154
01:07:36,070 --> 01:07:36,371
Listen,

2155
01:07:36,371 --> 01:07:37,600
I'm going out there and saying,

2156
01:07:37,601 --> 01:07:37,960
yeah,

2157
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:39,340
that don't sound too good.

2158
01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:41,110
I got you.

2159
01:07:41,710 --> 01:07:42,640
But we made it good.

2160
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:44,410
Yeah,

2161
01:07:44,410 --> 01:07:45,131
we made it good.

2162
01:07:45,131 --> 01:07:46,480
We made sure we took care of two.

2163
01:07:46,530 --> 01:07:46,801
We've,

2164
01:07:46,801 --> 01:07:47,560
we've made it,

2165
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:48,790
I know it was still dangerous.

2166
01:07:48,791 --> 01:07:49,600
It was still older,

2167
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:51,040
but you want to know something?

2168
01:07:51,370 --> 01:07:54,370
A kid drinking a bottle of vodka a
day was pretty freaking dangerous.

2169
01:07:54,790 --> 01:07:55,623
Okay.

2170
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:58,390
I had some idiot one time.

2171
01:07:58,540 --> 01:08:02,670
I was trying to get money
from my foundation and I
was explaining to him and he

2172
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:06,250
was a political guy and I was explaining
to them many calls have you got brain

2173
01:08:06,251 --> 01:08:10,010
damage of bugs and it is very day like I,

2174
01:08:10,070 --> 01:08:13,450
I was trying to like you when you want
to throw your headset when you see these

2175
01:08:13,451 --> 01:08:13,870
trucks.

2176
01:08:13,870 --> 01:08:14,980
I was like trying to control,

2177
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:16,153
I'm trying to talk to him.

2178
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:18,790
I supposed to talk to
right guy where this guy,

2179
01:08:18,791 --> 01:08:21,620
but I'm going to get money for my
foundation that helps these people.

2180
01:08:21,650 --> 01:08:22,310
Right.

2181
01:08:22,310 --> 01:08:24,290
So I'm trying to talk
to them and I'm saying,

2182
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:26,093
um,

2183
01:08:26,390 --> 01:08:30,530
do you get brain damage from being out
in the street and getting hit with a pipe

2184
01:08:30,531 --> 01:08:32,600
to get by deed because there's
the people I'm helping.

2185
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:35,570
Do you get brain damage
arm from doing crack?

2186
01:08:36,770 --> 01:08:37,820
Do you get brain damage?

2187
01:08:37,821 --> 01:08:41,990
I did have a kid who drank a bottle of
vodka now when he gave two to my program

2188
01:08:41,991 --> 01:08:43,310
and the foundation that we run,

2189
01:08:43,690 --> 01:08:44,523
uh,

2190
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:45,980
for two years,

2191
01:08:45,981 --> 01:08:47,510
he's been announced three years,

2192
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:50,030
he's been clean or his back was family.

2193
01:08:50,030 --> 01:08:51,230
He was living on the streets.

2194
01:08:51,410 --> 01:08:56,410
He was with gangs and when he got
into boxing in one of our programs,

2195
01:08:56,780 --> 01:08:57,340
uh,

2196
01:08:57,340 --> 01:08:57,740
he,

2197
01:08:57,740 --> 01:08:58,790
he stopped all that,

2198
01:08:59,150 --> 01:09:01,030
but he was drinking a
bottle of vodka years.

2199
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:01,400
True.

2200
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:01,991
15 year.

2201
01:09:01,991 --> 01:09:02,190
Yeah.

2202
01:09:02,190 --> 01:09:02,781
A lot of people say,

2203
01:09:02,781 --> 01:09:03,080
Teddy,

2204
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:03,740
how do you drink?

2205
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:04,220
Uh,

2206
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:04,821
yeah,

2207
01:09:04,821 --> 01:09:09,140
but it was how do you do it because you
have a lot of pain maybe or whatever,

2208
01:09:09,170 --> 01:09:10,003
whatever.

2209
01:09:10,310 --> 01:09:10,791
But yeah,

2210
01:09:10,791 --> 01:09:11,624
he was,

2211
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:12,820
and so I was,

2212
01:09:12,890 --> 01:09:13,970
I said to the guy who was trying,

2213
01:09:13,971 --> 01:09:15,110
not to get into an argument,

2214
01:09:15,111 --> 01:09:15,944
but I was like,

2215
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:18,590
boxing causes brain damage,

2216
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:20,750
but I'm taking guys away,

2217
01:09:21,050 --> 01:09:24,110
kids that the alternative
is to bottle of vodka,

2218
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:26,210
the crack the needle,

2219
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:31,520
the pipe on her head or maybe the pipe
on someone else's head where they caused

2220
01:09:31,521 --> 01:09:33,020
the brain damage to someone else.

2221
01:09:33,530 --> 01:09:33,830
May.

2222
01:09:33,830 --> 01:09:34,161
Maybe.

2223
01:09:34,161 --> 01:09:36,800
Unfortunately you'll one day
walking out of your house.

2224
01:09:37,820 --> 01:09:40,070
What about that brain damage?

2225
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:45,050
That's your way of telling me know
that your way of not giving me what I'm

2226
01:09:45,051 --> 01:09:46,940
asking for to say that.

2227
01:09:47,780 --> 01:09:49,520
Why don't you think it
out a little bit more?

2228
01:09:49,610 --> 01:09:52,940
Why don't you think it out a little
more and give me a better excuse?

2229
01:09:54,110 --> 01:09:56,190
Why don't you at least
understand what we're doing.

2230
01:09:56,450 --> 01:09:57,283
Yeah.

2231
01:09:57,920 --> 01:09:59,420
There's a reason why we're doing this.

2232
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:01,461
So these kids,

2233
01:10:01,461 --> 01:10:02,294
we would go,

2234
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:07,820
we would go to the south
Bronx and these kids would,

2235
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:09,570
they'd walk up,

2236
01:10:09,570 --> 01:10:09,901
you know,

2237
01:10:09,901 --> 01:10:10,551
like I said,

2238
01:10:10,551 --> 01:10:12,920
they've woke up two steps
by time that door opened up.

2239
01:10:13,450 --> 01:10:14,330
And again,

2240
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:19,070
this is how they paid the
rent by selling liquor,

2241
01:10:19,730 --> 01:10:24,470
by charging $3 to get in
and selling that food.

2242
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:26,570
And a place would be packed,

2243
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:27,973
packed.

2244
01:10:28,580 --> 01:10:30,500
And when the l one by you talk about,

2245
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:31,201
you told him,

2246
01:10:31,201 --> 01:10:33,530
we talked a little bit
about pressure and about,

2247
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:34,573
you know,

2248
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:35,930
what pressure does to you.

2249
01:10:36,050 --> 01:10:37,010
It can form,

2250
01:10:37,011 --> 01:10:40,460
you could destroy you booker form,

2251
01:10:40,461 --> 01:10:43,160
you can make you realize
what you're capable of.

2252
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:44,250
You know,

2253
01:10:44,250 --> 01:10:47,030
the greatest thing about what [inaudible]
does for somebody who makes them know

2254
01:10:47,150 --> 01:10:47,451
teddy,

2255
01:10:47,451 --> 01:10:48,620
what is box and do for you?

2256
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:49,800
Oh those are your jab.

2257
01:10:49,801 --> 01:10:51,320
You do know your condition,

2258
01:10:51,321 --> 01:10:52,430
you take care of your temple,

2259
01:10:52,431 --> 01:10:52,911
your body,

2260
01:10:52,911 --> 01:10:53,570
all that stuff.

2261
01:10:53,570 --> 01:10:54,410
Yeah it sounds good.

2262
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:55,731
Teddy,

2263
01:10:55,731 --> 01:10:57,790
give us one thing that
box and does for it.

2264
01:10:57,860 --> 01:10:59,750
Lets you know you could
depend on yourself.

2265
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:04,260
Lets a kid know that he can like himself.

2266
01:11:04,950 --> 01:11:05,431
We don't know.

2267
01:11:05,431 --> 01:11:07,470
He can like himself and depend on himself.

2268
01:11:07,530 --> 01:11:08,363
These kids.

2269
01:11:09,150 --> 01:11:09,983
So

2270
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:12,373
was it rough?

2271
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:12,861
Was rough.

2272
01:11:12,861 --> 01:11:17,520
So we're in the place and
has is no doctor here.

2273
01:11:17,521 --> 01:11:19,560
We had no sanction in organization.

2274
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:20,850
We made own fights,

2275
01:11:22,740 --> 01:11:24,240
but there was a danger.

2276
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:26,250
But it just told you the other dangers.

2277
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:30,220
This was taking them and
replacing those other dangers too.

2278
01:11:30,290 --> 01:11:31,440
Just taking them away from the,

2279
01:11:31,590 --> 01:11:32,011
you know what?

2280
01:11:32,011 --> 01:11:35,580
It was the only positive thing in
the neighborhood for these kids.

2281
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:36,593
It really was,

2282
01:11:36,670 --> 01:11:37,320
was a rough,

2283
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:38,153
yeah,

2284
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:39,433
it's boxing,

2285
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:42,420
but I just talked about life is rough,

2286
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:45,420
especially for these people refer.

2287
01:11:46,170 --> 01:11:49,290
So it was an alternative to violence.

2288
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:50,230
People say Teddy Way,

2289
01:11:50,231 --> 01:11:52,620
you're talking about bugs and no,

2290
01:11:53,490 --> 01:11:54,540
because if you're angry,

2291
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:55,890
which these kids are,

2292
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:58,500
if they don't learn to lose that anger,

2293
01:11:59,310 --> 01:12:02,820
they never become anything in boxing
because they walk in and get head.

2294
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:05,340
They learned that they
can control that anger.

2295
01:12:05,341 --> 01:12:06,390
They could put it somewhere.

2296
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:10,200
They learned that they
can control themselves.

2297
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:14,160
They can depend on themselves
to be something positive.

2298
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:19,740
So I would take these kids and we would
go there and we were the only white kids

2299
01:12:19,741 --> 01:12:20,574
in the place

2300
01:12:22,410 --> 01:12:23,730
and they loved us.

2301
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:25,711
There were funny,

2302
01:12:25,711 --> 01:12:26,161
like I said,

2303
01:12:26,161 --> 01:12:26,830
the guy who ran it,

2304
01:12:26,830 --> 01:12:27,570
Nelson,

2305
01:12:27,570 --> 01:12:28,090
he,

2306
01:12:28,090 --> 01:12:28,891
he's a great guy,

2307
01:12:28,891 --> 01:12:29,221
but he,

2308
01:12:29,221 --> 01:12:30,054
you know,

2309
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:30,601
I would look,

2310
01:12:30,601 --> 01:12:35,600
he carried a gun in his holster and
it's in his belt felt because he knew it

2311
01:12:35,610 --> 01:12:36,443
could be rough.

2312
01:12:37,230 --> 01:12:37,651
I mean,

2313
01:12:37,651 --> 01:12:38,610
I did,

2314
01:12:38,611 --> 01:12:42,720
I leave that part out to the parents
when I was taking him that the proprietor

2315
01:12:42,721 --> 01:12:43,554
of the place,

2316
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:43,891
you know,

2317
01:12:43,891 --> 01:12:48,010
has a gone and every once in a while he
opens his jacket and make sure that the

2318
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:49,670
people remember that he has.

2319
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:50,220
Yeah.

2320
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:51,053
Alright.

2321
01:12:51,510 --> 01:12:53,160
But they looked out for you.

2322
01:12:53,161 --> 01:12:53,994
They,

2323
01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:55,103
the kids.

2324
01:12:55,410 --> 01:12:55,920
I know,

2325
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:57,270
I know it sounds contrary.

2326
01:12:57,270 --> 01:12:58,860
I get it contradictory.

2327
01:12:58,861 --> 01:13:01,530
But it was these kids,

2328
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:04,860
they learned so much about
themselves and we protect,

2329
01:13:04,861 --> 01:13:05,461
I looked at,

2330
01:13:05,461 --> 01:13:10,461
we'd looked out for him and when it
came time to make the matches to point,

2331
01:13:10,531 --> 01:13:11,720
I was making about Walden.

2332
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:13,750
You talked about being long and about you.

2333
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:15,400
I'm sorry I jump all over the place.

2334
01:13:16,070 --> 01:13:16,950
But uh,

2335
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:17,870
above I,

2336
01:13:17,871 --> 01:13:18,930
oh I learned,

2337
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:21,270
cause taught me this.

2338
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:22,920
But you have to learn it yourself.

2339
01:13:23,610 --> 01:13:24,443
You have to see it.

2340
01:13:24,810 --> 01:13:26,970
You have to be in it
because told me about it.

2341
01:13:27,150 --> 01:13:28,350
But that's only part of it.

2342
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:30,631
He always told me,

2343
01:13:30,631 --> 01:13:31,350
teddy,

2344
01:13:31,350 --> 01:13:33,510
be careful with skinny wirey guys.

2345
01:13:34,220 --> 01:13:35,910
They had the greatest punches.

2346
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:38,280
Think I was thinking,

2347
01:13:38,281 --> 01:13:39,240
you know this,

2348
01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:41,520
they're the greatest punches.

2349
01:13:42,090 --> 01:13:43,860
He never told me why he
let me figure it out.

2350
01:13:44,190 --> 01:13:45,023
I saw it.

2351
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:48,240
I saw when he get him out.

2352
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:49,680
Yeah.

2353
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:50,370
You know what I mean?

2354
01:13:50,370 --> 01:13:51,203
Hearns here,

2355
01:13:51,810 --> 01:13:53,910
but I know why now leverage.

2356
01:13:53,940 --> 01:13:54,773
Yeah,

2357
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:55,620
talk,

2358
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:56,101
talk,

2359
01:13:56,101 --> 01:13:56,934
whatever you call that.

2360
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:58,290
And so anyway,

2361
01:13:58,291 --> 01:13:59,310
so here we are.

2362
01:13:59,910 --> 01:14:02,220
And if you saw the guy you
knew who to match with,

2363
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:03,900
but if you didn't see the guy,

2364
01:14:05,610 --> 01:14:07,440
you had to depend on other things.

2365
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:09,173
Who's the coach?

2366
01:14:09,330 --> 01:14:10,910
Certain cultures had no good fighters.

2367
01:14:10,930 --> 01:14:11,521
Certain coaches,

2368
01:14:11,521 --> 01:14:12,354
they're good fighters.

2369
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:14,073
Another coach.

2370
01:14:14,230 --> 01:14:17,260
Does he have a good
realize he honest sea lion.

2371
01:14:18,130 --> 01:14:19,030
Does he have,

2372
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:25,890
does he have an opinion that is
good or does he just say things?

2373
01:14:26,980 --> 01:14:30,010
So I'd have to go to all that
if I didn't know the guy,

2374
01:14:30,011 --> 01:14:34,180
I wouldn't put my kid in with the
guy unless I was sure what he was.

2375
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:35,373
Sure.

2376
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:38,830
And it was hard because
everyone was lying though.

2377
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:39,880
There was like a cold.

2378
01:14:40,870 --> 01:14:42,850
It was all connected
to lion unfortunately.

2379
01:14:43,050 --> 01:14:43,883
But,

2380
01:14:44,020 --> 01:14:45,640
but everyone looking out for their kid,

2381
01:14:45,790 --> 01:14:47,170
like if you'd said it,

2382
01:14:47,450 --> 01:14:48,570
I'll give you an example because we,

2383
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:50,140
I guess who the matchmaker was.

2384
01:14:51,190 --> 01:14:53,720
I became the matchmaker with,

2385
01:14:54,010 --> 01:14:54,400
you know,

2386
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:56,390
in a place where all Spanish black anyway,

2387
01:14:56,470 --> 01:14:58,360
but Nelson made me the matchmaker.

2388
01:14:58,420 --> 01:15:01,720
You be the matchmaker and a lot of
the people didn't speak English.

2389
01:15:01,721 --> 01:15:02,670
So you know,

2390
01:15:02,671 --> 01:15:02,890
we've,

2391
01:15:02,890 --> 01:15:04,330
we figured out we get there,

2392
01:15:05,110 --> 01:15:06,480
so I'd be there.

2393
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:08,440
So you make a column,

2394
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:09,760
the name of the fighter,

2395
01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:10,653
the weight.

2396
01:15:10,690 --> 01:15:10,961
Yeah.

2397
01:15:10,961 --> 01:15:12,250
He saw you your way in.

2398
01:15:12,251 --> 01:15:12,580
You know,

2399
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:13,181
that's one thing.

2400
01:15:13,181 --> 01:15:13,750
You see it.

2401
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:14,200
Okay.

2402
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:15,130
That's the only truth.

2403
01:15:15,910 --> 01:15:18,220
The rest of it got dicey.

2404
01:15:18,610 --> 01:15:18,911
Okay.

2405
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:20,710
How many fights most important thing,

2406
01:15:20,711 --> 01:15:22,030
most important thing.

2407
01:15:22,031 --> 01:15:22,864
How many fights?

2408
01:15:23,530 --> 01:15:24,363
Zero.

2409
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:26,470
Everyone in this place got zero fights

2410
01:15:29,050 --> 01:15:31,090
and Alice said nobody
got fights in its place.

2411
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,650
Even doing this for years.

2412
01:15:33,180 --> 01:15:35,260
And it's all okay.

2413
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:36,213
Here's the code.

2414
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:38,170
Zero fights means two or three.

2415
01:15:40,540 --> 01:15:40,841
One,

2416
01:15:40,841 --> 01:15:44,140
two or three fights meant six to 10.

2417
01:15:46,030 --> 01:15:48,880
God forbid anyone ever said they had five,

2418
01:15:48,881 --> 01:15:49,750
six fights,

2419
01:15:50,350 --> 01:15:53,350
anywhere from 25 to a hundred.

2420
01:15:59,350 --> 01:15:59,920
Real,

2421
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:00,370
real.

2422
01:16:00,370 --> 01:16:02,080
This is the world that
I lived in for five,

2423
01:16:02,081 --> 01:16:02,914
six years.

2424
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:05,020
Took them every Friday,

2425
01:16:05,050 --> 01:16:10,050
every drove down to the Bronx
and got them a smoker every week.

2426
01:16:10,810 --> 01:16:14,020
And so you figured out
to code after a while,

2427
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:20,040
but you're responsible for these kids
who you wanted every tangible thing you

2428
01:16:20,141 --> 01:16:20,974
could have.

2429
01:16:21,010 --> 01:16:21,730
So again,

2430
01:16:21,730 --> 01:16:26,110
if I wasn't sure how much the guy was
lying that he was lying a little extra,

2431
01:16:26,350 --> 01:16:27,183
I would,

2432
01:16:27,310 --> 01:16:27,600
uh,

2433
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:28,480
I'd go to Nelson.

2434
01:16:28,481 --> 01:16:29,290
You know this guy?

2435
01:16:29,290 --> 01:16:29,501
No,

2436
01:16:29,501 --> 01:16:30,700
but talk to Pablo.

2437
01:16:31,770 --> 01:16:32,291
Talk down.

2438
01:16:32,291 --> 01:16:33,124
Hell,

2439
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:34,473
all right.

2440
01:16:34,870 --> 01:16:35,703
You know the guy?

2441
01:16:36,580 --> 01:16:36,970
No.

2442
01:16:36,970 --> 01:16:37,540
Yeah,

2443
01:16:37,540 --> 01:16:40,120
he's stay away from no fight.

2444
01:16:40,620 --> 01:16:40,901
You know,

2445
01:16:40,901 --> 01:16:42,040
because I'm not taking the church.

2446
01:16:42,790 --> 01:16:45,160
But then when you get to the
point where you don't really know,

2447
01:16:46,990 --> 01:16:48,210
then I would just,

2448
01:16:48,211 --> 01:16:49,330
your instincts come alive.

2449
01:16:50,350 --> 01:16:51,310
You're protecting your kid.

2450
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:52,090
It's your kid,

2451
01:16:52,090 --> 01:16:52,901
it's your kid.

2452
01:16:52,901 --> 01:16:55,060
As much as it's paternally your kid,

2453
01:16:55,090 --> 01:16:56,140
it's your kid.

2454
01:16:57,610 --> 01:16:59,440
I remember one time I went up to the guy,

2455
01:16:59,441 --> 01:17:00,840
I couldn't get enough info.

2456
01:17:01,270 --> 01:17:02,230
I went up to the guy

2457
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:07,390
bought Nelson as an interpreter
because he didn't speak English.

2458
01:17:08,010 --> 01:17:08,890
And I said

2459
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:11,000
I know what we do here.

2460
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:14,990
Well I'm telling you is
I'm not putting my kid in,

2461
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:17,630
but to get beat up if it's fair,

2462
01:17:17,631 --> 01:17:20,900
it's fair by not putting them in
with a kid that's got 30 40 fights.

2463
01:17:20,901 --> 01:17:24,950
My kid legitimate
legitimately has two fights.

2464
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:25,993
I'm telling you,

2465
01:17:26,570 --> 01:17:27,890
I know we don't do that here.

2466
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:30,290
I'm telling you that's what he's got.

2467
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:32,240
If your kid's got 40 foot,

2468
01:17:32,241 --> 01:17:33,074
tell me,

2469
01:17:33,530 --> 01:17:35,670
just tell me and say no fight and,

2470
01:17:36,020 --> 01:17:38,390
and I'll shake your hand and that's it.

2471
01:17:38,870 --> 01:17:39,703
We're good.

2472
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:41,000
Yeah.

2473
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,160
So he kept,

2474
01:17:42,170 --> 01:17:43,490
he stood to story.

2475
01:17:45,190 --> 01:17:46,000
Okay,

2476
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,430
so we get close and I'm thinking,

2477
01:17:48,431 --> 01:17:48,941
I'm thinking,

2478
01:17:48,941 --> 01:17:52,060
I'm thinking and I'm watching a
guy warmup cause always told me,

2479
01:17:52,061 --> 01:17:53,320
watch the Guy Walmart,

2480
01:17:54,070 --> 01:17:55,120
watch them warm up.

2481
01:17:55,780 --> 01:17:58,100
I'll watch in a more more pop pop pop by

2482
01:18:00,010 --> 01:18:00,843
bap,

2483
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:01,260
bap,

2484
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:02,093
bap.

2485
01:18:02,380 --> 01:18:04,570
I said this guy didn't have to fight.

2486
01:18:05,590 --> 01:18:05,951
I mean,

2487
01:18:05,951 --> 01:18:10,060
I'm a pretty good trainer
and even with our fights,

2488
01:18:10,061 --> 01:18:13,120
I think I teach them technically what
they need to know before they get to

2489
01:18:13,121 --> 01:18:13,750
explore.

2490
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:16,340
But this guy was beyond that.

2491
01:18:17,470 --> 01:18:18,070
I mean,

2492
01:18:18,070 --> 01:18:19,780
you know this was sugar ray Robinson,

2493
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:22,780
so I go back to Nelson.

2494
01:18:22,781 --> 01:18:23,021
I said,

2495
01:18:23,021 --> 01:18:25,630
bring him over here again
10 minutes before the fight.

2496
01:18:27,010 --> 01:18:28,080
So bring them over here again,

2497
01:18:29,050 --> 01:18:29,883
comes off

2498
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:32,680
a little bit of an attitude,

2499
01:18:32,740 --> 01:18:32,921
so,

2500
01:18:32,921 --> 01:18:33,111
right.

2501
01:18:33,111 --> 01:18:34,720
Everyone's got attitudes in his business.

2502
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:36,190
Is it?

2503
01:18:36,190 --> 01:18:37,023
Hey

2504
01:18:38,230 --> 01:18:39,063
listen,

2505
01:18:40,510 --> 01:18:41,343
one more time.

2506
01:18:43,450 --> 01:18:45,380
I'm just want to tell you not threatening.

2507
01:18:45,381 --> 01:18:46,214
Yeah,

2508
01:18:46,930 --> 01:18:48,190
but I have to tell you this.

2509
01:18:49,660 --> 01:18:50,200
Okay.

2510
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:51,700
It told me he's got no fights,

2511
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:52,181
whatever,

2512
01:18:52,181 --> 01:18:55,060
to five with them when the bell rings.

2513
01:18:56,050 --> 01:18:57,310
If you got over on me,

2514
01:18:58,420 --> 01:18:59,111
I was wrong.

2515
01:18:59,111 --> 01:18:59,944
You were right.

2516
01:19:00,690 --> 01:19:01,630
Soon as the bell rings,

2517
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:02,464
I'm going to see.

2518
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:03,953
I'm going to know it.

2519
01:19:05,090 --> 01:19:05,580
Yeah,

2520
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:06,140
there's not,

2521
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:08,940
you can say afterwards
to say to explain it,

2522
01:19:09,810 --> 01:19:10,643
handle it,

2523
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:14,850
and I'll stop the fight if I have
to because I'll protect my kid.

2524
01:19:16,370 --> 01:19:16,921
I might have to.

2525
01:19:16,921 --> 01:19:17,371
I do that.

2526
01:19:17,371 --> 01:19:18,480
I'll be coming over to you.

2527
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:20,970
That's all I'm going to say.

2528
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:23,880
So please,

2529
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:25,560
please for you,

2530
01:19:25,561 --> 01:19:26,394
for me,

2531
01:19:26,970 --> 01:19:27,803
please.

2532
01:19:30,490 --> 01:19:31,323
If it's,

2533
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:32,313
if it's,

2534
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:33,520
if it's what I'm saying,

2535
01:19:33,550 --> 01:19:35,110
please just,

2536
01:19:35,350 --> 01:19:35,891
just tell him,

2537
01:19:35,891 --> 01:19:36,281
Nelson,

2538
01:19:36,281 --> 01:19:37,240
you don't have to tell me.

2539
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:42,580
Just tell Nelson when I leave here
that we're not going to fight.

2540
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:45,970
Nelson came back to me four minutes,

2541
01:19:45,971 --> 01:19:46,481
three minutes,

2542
01:19:46,481 --> 01:19:47,440
two minutes later and said,

2543
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:48,800
he said no.

2544
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:49,630
Fine.

2545
01:19:49,630 --> 01:19:50,141
Thank you.

2546
01:19:50,141 --> 01:19:51,010
Tell him thank you.

2547
01:19:52,030 --> 01:19:52,930
Tell him thank you.

2548
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:56,290
That's the world we lived in there,

2549
01:19:57,110 --> 01:19:58,030
but we got it done.

2550
01:19:58,270 --> 01:19:59,200
We got it done though,

2551
01:19:59,201 --> 01:20:00,034
Joe.

2552
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:00,880
We did.

2553
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:01,713
We really did.

2554
01:20:02,260 --> 01:20:06,400
And thank God that someone like you was
able to understand that there is a big

2555
01:20:06,401 --> 01:20:08,220
difference and that you can,

2556
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:09,090
you know,

2557
01:20:09,090 --> 01:20:10,830
these guys that sandbag like that,

2558
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:11,671
that's very,

2559
01:20:11,671 --> 01:20:12,770
very common and,

2560
01:20:12,860 --> 01:20:13,693
and yeah,

2561
01:20:13,710 --> 01:20:17,120
and see they think that they're gaining
something because you know what I mean?

2562
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:18,640
They just want to fuck somebody.

2563
01:20:18,650 --> 01:20:18,810
Yeah,

2564
01:20:18,810 --> 01:20:19,250
yeah,

2565
01:20:19,250 --> 01:20:20,083
yeah.

2566
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:21,090
And so,

2567
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:22,640
but let me tell you something.

2568
01:20:23,730 --> 01:20:24,750
My kids,

2569
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:27,360
I mean like when,

2570
01:20:27,361 --> 01:20:28,940
when we first started fighting there,

2571
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:30,810
they had bungled Trumpsters hi.

2572
01:20:32,490 --> 01:20:33,323
I,

2573
01:20:33,420 --> 01:20:34,950
I mean my kids had never seen bong.

2574
01:20:35,010 --> 01:20:36,390
I didn't see Bongo drums.

2575
01:20:36,391 --> 01:20:36,571
That,

2576
01:20:36,571 --> 01:20:37,404
what am I saying?

2577
01:20:39,010 --> 01:20:40,050
But they were this high,

2578
01:20:40,051 --> 01:20:41,790
they were bilingual and they win a ring.

2579
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:43,153
They only came out,

2580
01:20:43,350 --> 01:20:43,680
you know,

2581
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:44,071
when,

2582
01:20:44,071 --> 01:20:44,670
when we,

2583
01:20:44,670 --> 01:20:48,990
when we got ready to fight and they're
playing the bongos and great music.

2584
01:20:48,991 --> 01:20:49,410
I mean,

2585
01:20:49,410 --> 01:20:50,130
really it was,

2586
01:20:50,130 --> 01:20:50,730
you know,

2587
01:20:50,730 --> 01:20:51,730
but you know what,

2588
01:20:52,530 --> 01:20:57,530
when you're hearing that bungle music
and you're in the ring and you're talking

2589
01:20:58,021 --> 01:21:01,530
to the kid in the corner and they're
outside now with the bangles and they're

2590
01:21:01,531 --> 01:21:03,000
playing the bongos and you're talking,

2591
01:21:04,290 --> 01:21:05,280
that's an atmosphere.

2592
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:05,940
Yeah.

2593
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:06,773
That's different.

2594
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:07,740
That's real experience.

2595
01:21:07,741 --> 01:21:08,790
That's experience.

2596
01:21:08,910 --> 01:21:10,290
That's life experience.

2597
01:21:10,291 --> 01:21:10,770
Yeah.

2598
01:21:10,770 --> 01:21:11,440
You know what I mean?

2599
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:11,950
Yeah.

2600
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:12,660
Yeah.

2601
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:14,100
That's not taught in the classroom.

2602
01:21:14,550 --> 01:21:15,210
And,

2603
01:21:15,210 --> 01:21:19,450
and my kids have to six years of that
because that's about how long we did it.

2604
01:21:19,451 --> 01:21:19,680
No,

2605
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:21,840
I was up to seven years
train of photos for cost.

2606
01:21:21,841 --> 01:21:22,674
So,

2607
01:21:22,980 --> 01:21:23,813
um,

2608
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:25,411
I'm telling you,

2609
01:21:25,411 --> 01:21:26,520
my kids grew up,

2610
01:21:26,610 --> 01:21:27,060
they go,

2611
01:21:27,060 --> 01:21:30,780
did they all go on to be pros and did
they go on to be Olympic chair now?

2612
01:21:31,290 --> 01:21:36,290
But they took that and they used it
to be better at what they did into,

2613
01:21:37,420 --> 01:21:42,060
to have the confidence to do things they
might not have had the confidence to do

2614
01:21:42,780 --> 01:21:43,920
without that experience.

2615
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:45,750
I got a couple of them
that have state troopers.

2616
01:21:45,751 --> 01:21:48,270
I got a couple of them that
are teachers in high school.

2617
01:21:48,271 --> 01:21:48,960
I got a co,

2618
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:49,261
you know,

2619
01:21:49,261 --> 01:21:50,520
all different things.

2620
01:21:51,090 --> 01:21:51,250
Who,

2621
01:21:51,250 --> 01:21:52,800
couple that went to college that,

2622
01:21:52,801 --> 01:21:54,600
that the nobody in their,

2623
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:58,650
in their history of their family
ever went beyond high school.

2624
01:21:59,130 --> 01:22:01,850
But they went to college and
they were kind of told them,

2625
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:03,650
you're never going to go to college.

2626
01:22:03,690 --> 01:22:07,500
They went to college and I would like
to believe it had something to do with

2627
01:22:07,501 --> 01:22:08,310
that,

2628
01:22:08,310 --> 01:22:09,143
you know,

2629
01:22:09,390 --> 01:22:10,223
and um,

2630
01:22:10,230 --> 01:22:10,930
I,

2631
01:22:10,930 --> 01:22:14,790
a lot of people ask me who was your
greatly because I had Tyson to there,

2632
01:22:14,791 --> 01:22:15,061
you know,

2633
01:22:15,061 --> 01:22:15,360
he was,

2634
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:16,193
he became one of them.

2635
01:22:18,180 --> 01:22:19,013
And um,

2636
01:22:19,710 --> 01:22:22,260
I remember it was funny because
when I would put it down,

2637
01:22:22,410 --> 01:22:22,951
like I said,

2638
01:22:22,951 --> 01:22:24,270
everyone lied about the experience,

2639
01:22:24,271 --> 01:22:25,260
but you know,

2640
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:26,760
they lied about everything.

2641
01:22:26,761 --> 01:22:28,020
But I would put down,

2642
01:22:28,030 --> 01:22:28,260
uh,

2643
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:28,651
you know,

2644
01:22:28,651 --> 01:22:28,961
the,

2645
01:22:28,961 --> 01:22:30,390
the age and everything else,

2646
01:22:30,391 --> 01:22:31,950
all the stuff for what it was worth,

2647
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:34,950
you had to have something
to try to believe in.

2648
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:35,721
If I didn't,

2649
01:22:35,721 --> 01:22:36,900
I'd figure it out from there.

2650
01:22:37,710 --> 01:22:39,150
So Tyson,

2651
01:22:39,151 --> 01:22:39,931
when I first had him,

2652
01:22:39,931 --> 01:22:41,490
he was 190 pounds,

2653
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:42,091
not a bum.

2654
01:22:42,091 --> 01:22:43,530
Also 12 years old.

2655
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:43,831
Okay.

2656
01:22:43,831 --> 01:22:44,664
That's what it was.

2657
01:22:44,790 --> 01:22:45,900
But that's what he was,

2658
01:22:45,901 --> 01:22:46,201
I mean,

2659
01:22:46,201 --> 01:22:47,340
that's what God made it.

2660
01:22:47,740 --> 01:22:48,450
So,

2661
01:22:48,450 --> 01:22:50,490
so I go down and I put the first fight.

2662
01:22:50,550 --> 01:22:51,690
Nobody's seen Tyson,

2663
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:53,130
nobody's ever seen data,

2664
01:22:53,490 --> 01:22:54,620
but 12 years old,

2665
01:22:54,870 --> 01:22:56,520
zero phase flow.

2666
01:22:56,910 --> 01:22:57,300
Okay.

2667
01:22:57,300 --> 01:22:58,133
Hello

2668
01:23:00,210 --> 01:23:01,043
Daddy.

2669
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:02,820
Now you go too far.

2670
01:23:03,210 --> 01:23:04,210
You like more than I

2671
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:13,293
know.

2672
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:14,580
You learn a lot from us.

2673
01:23:16,540 --> 01:23:16,950
Okay?

2674
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:17,240
I said,

2675
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:17,520
thanks.

2676
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:18,353
That's a compliment.

2677
01:23:20,490 --> 01:23:21,241
That's a compliment.

2678
01:23:21,241 --> 01:23:21,541
I mean,

2679
01:23:21,541 --> 01:23:22,051
I'd take it,

2680
01:23:22,051 --> 01:23:22,771
I as it is,

2681
01:23:22,771 --> 01:23:23,160
right,

2682
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:23,970
right.

2683
01:23:23,970 --> 01:23:25,530
I'm not like 12 years old.

2684
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:26,970
190 pounds.

2685
01:23:26,971 --> 01:23:27,451
Please,

2686
01:23:27,451 --> 01:23:27,871
please,

2687
01:23:27,871 --> 01:23:28,704
please.

2688
01:23:29,890 --> 01:23:30,361
And also,

2689
01:23:30,361 --> 01:23:31,200
I'm going learning.

2690
01:23:31,260 --> 01:23:31,950
Okay.

2691
01:23:31,950 --> 01:23:33,000
He's 12 years old.

2692
01:23:33,090 --> 01:23:34,470
It's got to be 13 soon,

2693
01:23:34,740 --> 01:23:35,820
but he's technically,

2694
01:23:35,821 --> 01:23:36,730
he's 12 years older.

2695
01:23:36,740 --> 01:23:37,573
Gay.

2696
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:38,251
Oh,

2697
01:23:38,251 --> 01:23:39,084
come on.

2698
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:39,841
I said,

2699
01:23:39,841 --> 01:23:40,091
all right,

2700
01:23:40,091 --> 01:23:40,980
I'll make you feel bad.

2701
01:23:40,981 --> 01:23:41,910
I put down 70.

2702
01:23:41,950 --> 01:23:43,260
[inaudible] now you tell the truth.

2703
01:23:45,830 --> 01:23:46,663
Okay.

2704
01:23:49,730 --> 01:23:51,540
But I knew what I like side.

2705
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:52,393
I knew what I had.

2706
01:23:52,490 --> 01:23:53,840
So I fought a 17 year old.

2707
01:23:54,830 --> 01:23:56,330
I wasn't going to find no 12 year old.

2708
01:23:56,331 --> 01:23:57,164
That wasn't going to happen.

2709
01:23:57,290 --> 01:23:57,920
Right.

2710
01:23:57,920 --> 01:23:59,330
And plus I get arrested for murder.

2711
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:00,530
So,

2712
01:24:00,530 --> 01:24:00,831
oh,

2713
01:24:00,831 --> 01:24:02,630
what was he like at 12 years old?

2714
01:24:02,631 --> 01:24:04,280
Physically or mentally weak.

2715
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:05,630
But physically,

2716
01:24:06,710 --> 01:24:08,030
what do I mean mentally weak,

2717
01:24:08,510 --> 01:24:09,740
not weak for the average guy,

2718
01:24:09,741 --> 01:24:11,150
but before fighter,

2719
01:24:11,590 --> 01:24:12,423
um,

2720
01:24:13,940 --> 01:24:18,940
he's still have remanence
he still had residual

2721
01:24:21,470 --> 01:24:22,730
stuff from his upbringing.

2722
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:23,270
Listen,

2723
01:24:23,270 --> 01:24:24,520
you wanna know the truth about the guy.

2724
01:24:24,980 --> 01:24:25,730
He orders,

2725
01:24:25,730 --> 01:24:30,730
but he used to hide in between abandoned
building walls in Brownsville was a

2726
01:24:30,921 --> 01:24:31,580
rough place.

2727
01:24:31,580 --> 01:24:32,413
No doubt about it.

2728
01:24:32,540 --> 01:24:33,770
Didn't have a father of whatever,

2729
01:24:33,771 --> 01:24:35,030
the mother of whatever.

2730
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:36,313
And uh,

2731
01:24:36,350 --> 01:24:37,183
he,

2732
01:24:37,790 --> 01:24:41,870
he used to hide between
walls to not get picked on.

2733
01:24:42,170 --> 01:24:43,640
And I believe when you do that,

2734
01:24:44,060 --> 01:24:46,970
you never get outside of that
wall to a certain extent.

2735
01:24:47,210 --> 01:24:49,730
You're always hiding in our
wall for the rest of your life.

2736
01:24:50,270 --> 01:24:52,780
That's just my belief that teddy,

2737
01:24:52,790 --> 01:24:53,601
what are you talking about?

2738
01:24:53,601 --> 01:24:54,590
It became everyone chip.

2739
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:55,790
Some people think he's the greatest.

2740
01:24:55,791 --> 01:24:56,624
I begged her.

2741
01:25:00,140 --> 01:25:03,110
I don't have his record in front of me
and this is going to blow some people

2742
01:25:03,111 --> 01:25:03,944
crazy,

2743
01:25:03,980 --> 01:25:05,030
but what are you going to do?

2744
01:25:06,740 --> 01:25:07,550
I don't have his record.

2745
01:25:07,550 --> 01:25:11,380
Let's just say we're going to make an
arbitrary number because your man is going

2746
01:25:11,381 --> 01:25:12,200
to pull it up,

2747
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:17,200
but let's just say it's 50 and six I
would say five 15 five but whatever.

2748
01:25:20,630 --> 01:25:21,680
I think his record

2749
01:25:23,810 --> 01:25:24,471
is truly,

2750
01:25:24,471 --> 01:25:25,191
if you're going to be this,

2751
01:25:25,191 --> 01:25:26,930
and we're not truly in life with anything,

2752
01:25:26,931 --> 01:25:28,190
but if we're truly,

2753
01:25:28,191 --> 01:25:30,920
truly in an Absolut world,

2754
01:25:31,340 --> 01:25:32,330
which we don't live in,

2755
01:25:32,930 --> 01:25:36,770
but I would say he's all in five.

2756
01:25:37,310 --> 01:25:40,520
I know everybody says everyone who is
listening to you think it's just like,

2757
01:25:41,090 --> 01:25:42,290
let me get with Teddy's drinking,

2758
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:44,580
like I don't see them drinking nothing,

2759
01:25:44,590 --> 01:25:46,280
but he probably had
some before he came in.

2760
01:25:47,990 --> 01:25:48,823
To me,

2761
01:25:49,130 --> 01:25:53,600
a fight is not a fight into
this resistance to there
is something to overcome,

2762
01:25:54,620 --> 01:25:56,300
something to overcome.

2763
01:25:57,530 --> 01:25:59,240
Otherwise it's just an athletic venture.

2764
01:25:59,630 --> 01:26:00,500
It's an exhibition.

2765
01:26:02,270 --> 01:26:03,320
I think life is that.

2766
01:26:04,310 --> 01:26:05,030
I think the,

2767
01:26:05,030 --> 01:26:07,040
you don't know of a
lawyer is a lawyer into,

2768
01:26:07,610 --> 01:26:08,310
into the some,

2769
01:26:08,310 --> 01:26:09,330
the overcoming the courtroom.

2770
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:10,340
Something goes for,

2771
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:11,473
okay.

2772
01:26:11,580 --> 01:26:12,950
I know he's a lawyer.

2773
01:26:12,951 --> 01:26:13,251
I know.

2774
01:26:13,251 --> 01:26:13,830
He went to see,

2775
01:26:13,830 --> 01:26:14,510
I get it.

2776
01:26:14,510 --> 01:26:15,830
Nobody has to tell me that,

2777
01:26:16,130 --> 01:26:17,030
but he ain't a lawyer.

2778
01:26:17,790 --> 01:26:21,800
He ate that until everything goes wrong.

2779
01:26:21,801 --> 01:26:25,010
The judge throws all this crap out and,

2780
01:26:25,011 --> 01:26:25,844
and he's,

2781
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:27,320
he is EFT,

2782
01:26:27,620 --> 01:26:29,120
so to speak and,

2783
01:26:29,150 --> 01:26:31,130
and he figures and he's still handles it.

2784
01:26:31,670 --> 01:26:32,503
Then he's a lawyer.

2785
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:34,340
A doctor is not a doctor too.

2786
01:26:34,460 --> 01:26:35,690
He opens up this kid,

2787
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:36,620
a kid.

2788
01:26:36,620 --> 01:26:37,490
It's just like he's got it.

2789
01:26:37,491 --> 01:26:41,420
Home and arteries are bleeding
all over the place and,

2790
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:42,110
and it,

2791
01:26:42,110 --> 01:26:43,910
it's not in a textbook.

2792
01:26:44,210 --> 01:26:47,390
It's not in a big and
textbook and he got to do it.

2793
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:49,400
He got to figure it out and he got,

2794
01:26:49,401 --> 01:26:52,550
then he's a doctor that he's
a surgeon at that level.

2795
01:26:53,550 --> 01:26:54,383
You,

2796
01:26:54,830 --> 01:26:55,663
you're not,

2797
01:26:56,970 --> 01:26:57,600
yeah.

2798
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:59,050
You are not in a fight.

2799
01:26:59,130 --> 01:26:59,480
I,

2800
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:00,340
I look,

2801
01:27:00,370 --> 01:27:01,390
I admitted.

2802
01:27:01,420 --> 01:27:02,830
I equate life to a fight.

2803
01:27:02,860 --> 01:27:03,693
I do.

2804
01:27:03,970 --> 01:27:05,320
You're not in a fight.

2805
01:27:06,490 --> 01:27:10,750
And so there's pressure
resistance overcoming something.

2806
01:27:10,990 --> 01:27:12,580
Otherwise it's just an exhibition.

2807
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:15,220
Tyson's talent was so great.

2808
01:27:15,460 --> 01:27:16,930
His physical ability,

2809
01:27:17,140 --> 01:27:19,540
his talent was so overwhelming.

2810
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:24,070
Just like somebody
intellect to some parties,

2811
01:27:24,071 --> 01:27:24,904
charisma,

2812
01:27:25,660 --> 01:27:30,220
whatever beauty until it
came to something else.

2813
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:35,520
But his talent was so superior that
the other stuff never got tested.

2814
01:27:35,830 --> 01:27:39,310
He was blown guys out and
he had never got tested.

2815
01:27:39,340 --> 01:27:41,560
If there was anything in the warehouse,

2816
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:45,250
so to speak of is anything
inside you never knew.

2817
01:27:45,580 --> 01:27:46,870
And then five times,

2818
01:27:46,871 --> 01:27:48,100
whatever the real record is,

2819
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:50,290
five times there was resistance.

2820
01:27:51,070 --> 01:27:52,960
Five times it became a real fight.

2821
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:54,460
Five Times.

2822
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:56,110
It was something to overcome.

2823
01:27:57,190 --> 01:27:58,660
And He fell it all five times.

2824
01:27:59,210 --> 01:28:02,980
He was only in five fights
in his life and his own five,

2825
01:28:03,730 --> 01:28:05,220
I'm sorry sal graves,

2826
01:28:05,221 --> 01:28:06,870
because we know my history with them.

2827
01:28:06,930 --> 01:28:08,560
I am.

2828
01:28:08,561 --> 01:28:09,011
I am.

2829
01:28:09,011 --> 01:28:09,910
I am.

2830
01:28:10,390 --> 01:28:12,110
Am I capable of died?

2831
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:12,700
Newman.

2832
01:28:12,700 --> 01:28:13,450
Yeah,

2833
01:28:13,450 --> 01:28:15,010
but I can honestly tell you

2834
01:28:17,230 --> 01:28:18,710
that I,

2835
01:28:20,230 --> 01:28:20,650
I took,

2836
01:28:20,650 --> 01:28:21,150
um,

2837
01:28:21,150 --> 01:28:22,350
I try to be better than that,

2838
01:28:23,010 --> 01:28:23,311
that,

2839
01:28:23,311 --> 01:28:25,710
that I've called many
fights where the people,

2840
01:28:25,730 --> 01:28:26,151
the corner,

2841
01:28:26,151 --> 01:28:26,984
I couldn't stand him.

2842
01:28:27,210 --> 01:28:28,290
I had no respect for them.

2843
01:28:28,830 --> 01:28:29,341
But if they,

2844
01:28:29,341 --> 01:28:31,680
if they did a good job in a
corner to fight it did a job.

2845
01:28:31,830 --> 01:28:33,180
I talked to about,

2846
01:28:33,181 --> 01:28:33,511
I'm like,

2847
01:28:33,511 --> 01:28:38,511
they were radio cell like they were
Angelo Dundee because that's what it was

2848
01:28:38,761 --> 01:28:39,594
supposed to be.

2849
01:28:39,810 --> 01:28:40,643
That's all.

2850
01:28:41,010 --> 01:28:43,530
And it's selfish because I don't want,

2851
01:28:43,590 --> 01:28:44,520
I wanna have,

2852
01:28:44,550 --> 01:28:49,350
I wanna know and I want my kids to
know that I can be better than that.

2853
01:28:49,351 --> 01:28:49,830
That,

2854
01:28:49,830 --> 01:28:51,210
that it's,

2855
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:52,140
it's about right.

2856
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:54,040
Okay.

2857
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:55,280
It's about the code of,

2858
01:28:55,281 --> 01:28:56,320
of the profession.

2859
01:28:56,321 --> 01:28:56,570
It's a,

2860
01:28:56,570 --> 01:28:57,401
it's about you.

2861
01:28:57,401 --> 01:28:57,881
It's about,

2862
01:28:57,881 --> 01:28:59,380
you believe in that.

2863
01:28:59,381 --> 01:29:01,200
Would you say is

2864
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:03,600
she'll be honest.

2865
01:29:03,601 --> 01:29:04,980
It should be what you believe.

2866
01:29:05,370 --> 01:29:06,880
It shouldn't be tainted or,

2867
01:29:07,110 --> 01:29:07,540
or,

2868
01:29:07,540 --> 01:29:11,680
or influenced by lesser things that,

2869
01:29:11,681 --> 01:29:12,830
that it does represent you.

2870
01:29:12,831 --> 01:29:14,280
It does represent your family.

2871
01:29:14,281 --> 01:29:15,870
It does represent where you came from.

2872
01:29:16,290 --> 01:29:17,400
It does stay.

2873
01:29:17,940 --> 01:29:22,940
Do you know your blurted out for those
five minutes or maybe two hours on ESPN,

2874
01:29:23,610 --> 01:29:26,670
but it stays somewhat,

2875
01:29:26,671 --> 01:29:27,720
could go back to it.

2876
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:29,370
You could go back to it.

2877
01:29:30,060 --> 01:29:31,080
How do you feel about it?

2878
01:29:31,081 --> 01:29:31,681
It does mean,

2879
01:29:31,681 --> 01:29:32,910
so it really does.

2880
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:38,960
And so I'm only saying it because I
would say it about somebody else in a way

2881
01:29:41,641 --> 01:29:43,290
that I calibrate things.

2882
01:29:43,350 --> 01:29:48,300
The way that I evaluate things that I
don't think that you know crap about

2883
01:29:48,301 --> 01:29:50,510
somebody until they're tested.

2884
01:29:50,850 --> 01:29:52,200
You don't know the friend.

2885
01:29:52,530 --> 01:29:54,090
You don't know if they're good wife.

2886
01:29:54,450 --> 01:29:56,010
You don't know if the good girlfriend,

2887
01:29:56,670 --> 01:29:59,460
you don't know crap you think you do,

2888
01:30:00,020 --> 01:30:01,590
but until they're really tested,

2889
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:03,480
you don't really know.

2890
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:05,160
And Tyson,

2891
01:30:05,161 --> 01:30:06,060
when he got tested,

2892
01:30:06,061 --> 01:30:07,200
when he had to overcome some,

2893
01:30:07,350 --> 01:30:07,710
when,

2894
01:30:07,710 --> 01:30:08,950
when he didn't run him over,

2895
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:09,300
like,

2896
01:30:09,300 --> 01:30:12,840
like one of those big monster trucks
running over a Volkswagen because he was a

2897
01:30:12,841 --> 01:30:14,250
monster truck pull Volkswagen's.

2898
01:30:14,251 --> 01:30:14,550
Yeah,

2899
01:30:14,550 --> 01:30:15,383
he was.

2900
01:30:15,470 --> 01:30:15,720
Yeah,

2901
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:16,553
he was.

2902
01:30:16,860 --> 01:30:18,750
And was he wanted the greatest punches or,

2903
01:30:18,930 --> 01:30:19,351
yeah.

2904
01:30:19,351 --> 01:30:20,184
Yes.

2905
01:30:20,310 --> 01:30:22,080
Could he pumped from
either side of the plate,

2906
01:30:22,081 --> 01:30:23,880
like Mickey Mann or the
greatest switch hitter?

2907
01:30:24,030 --> 01:30:24,930
Was He that in by,

2908
01:30:24,931 --> 01:30:25,764
yes.

2909
01:30:25,980 --> 01:30:26,131
Could.

2910
01:30:26,131 --> 01:30:27,120
He could punch evenly.

2911
01:30:27,121 --> 01:30:28,170
Great with either hand.

2912
01:30:28,190 --> 01:30:28,511
For me,

2913
01:30:28,511 --> 01:30:29,400
the side,

2914
01:30:30,270 --> 01:30:31,500
was he all those things?

2915
01:30:31,501 --> 01:30:32,100
Yes.

2916
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:34,680
Was he as great intimidators Sonny Liston?

2917
01:30:34,681 --> 01:30:35,514
Yes.

2918
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:39,150
Was he a great finisher like Joe Louis?

2919
01:30:39,151 --> 01:30:39,930
To a certain extent,

2920
01:30:39,930 --> 01:30:40,763
yes.

2921
01:30:41,930 --> 01:30:42,763
Okay.

2922
01:30:42,780 --> 01:30:43,980
But he wasn't a great fighter.

2923
01:30:45,550 --> 01:30:46,190
Yeah.

2924
01:30:46,190 --> 01:30:48,350
Because great fighters won.

2925
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:49,700
The fight came to them.

2926
01:30:51,390 --> 01:30:54,330
They found the way to
do what they had to do.

2927
01:30:55,890 --> 01:30:58,710
He found a way to disappear.

2928
01:30:59,190 --> 01:31:00,480
They found a way to show up.

2929
01:31:01,610 --> 01:31:01,830
Yeah.

2930
01:31:01,830 --> 01:31:02,663
Show up.

2931
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:05,970
He found the way to go and not show up

2932
01:31:07,470 --> 01:31:07,861
and look.

2933
01:31:07,861 --> 01:31:11,820
You could go talk to psychiatrists and
you could go to all the reasons why.

2934
01:31:13,140 --> 01:31:15,690
Hiding between a wall when he was a kid.

2935
01:31:15,730 --> 01:31:16,100
Yeah.

2936
01:31:16,100 --> 01:31:16,370
That,

2937
01:31:16,370 --> 01:31:17,280
that's part of it.

2938
01:31:18,060 --> 01:31:19,230
I'll tell you another part of it.

2939
01:31:20,790 --> 01:31:21,870
To be that,

2940
01:31:22,110 --> 01:31:23,580
not to be the power puncher,

2941
01:31:23,790 --> 01:31:25,620
not to be the aggressor,

2942
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:26,371
not to be.

2943
01:31:26,371 --> 01:31:27,450
Just those things.

2944
01:31:27,660 --> 01:31:28,560
To be,

2945
01:31:29,220 --> 01:31:29,971
to tighten,

2946
01:31:29,971 --> 01:31:31,020
to be the Viking,

2947
01:31:32,790 --> 01:31:33,870
to be the Samurai,

2948
01:31:34,110 --> 01:31:34,980
to be the warrior,

2949
01:31:35,460 --> 01:31:38,460
to be those things has to be inside you.

2950
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:39,953
You have to believe it.

2951
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:41,330
It all.

2952
01:31:41,330 --> 01:31:42,960
A lot of times people lie in life.

2953
01:31:43,150 --> 01:31:44,040
This is Fullerton plays.

2954
01:31:44,041 --> 01:31:44,874
You can't lie.

2955
01:31:46,410 --> 01:31:46,801
You know?

2956
01:31:46,801 --> 01:31:49,530
Sometimes we'd say that the
ring is a chamber of truth.

2957
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:49,801
You know,

2958
01:31:49,801 --> 01:31:50,970
it sounds good and all that,

2959
01:31:50,971 --> 01:31:52,640
but it is.

2960
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:57,510
It is because just just like
in other places in life too,

2961
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:00,130
when moment comes

2962
01:32:02,030 --> 01:32:03,650
for those kinds of serious things.

2963
01:32:04,910 --> 01:32:05,390
Okay.

2964
01:32:05,390 --> 01:32:06,920
You have to feel like that.

2965
01:32:07,820 --> 01:32:09,320
You say that you're the conqueror,

2966
01:32:09,321 --> 01:32:10,490
you Alexander the Great,

2967
01:32:10,491 --> 01:32:11,330
you all those things.

2968
01:32:11,331 --> 01:32:11,601
Right.

2969
01:32:11,601 --> 01:32:11,931
Okay.

2970
01:32:11,931 --> 01:32:13,040
Words sounds great.

2971
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:15,050
Makes good soundbites.

2972
01:32:15,710 --> 01:32:17,450
Probably bring more people to the TV,

2973
01:32:17,990 --> 01:32:21,830
but when the moment comes and you didn't
intimidate a guy that didn't work.

2974
01:32:22,130 --> 01:32:22,910
Okay.

2975
01:32:22,910 --> 01:32:24,500
We all try it to a certain extent.

2976
01:32:24,501 --> 01:32:24,770
Right?

2977
01:32:24,770 --> 01:32:25,191
Probably.

2978
01:32:25,191 --> 01:32:26,024
Yeah.

2979
01:32:26,570 --> 01:32:30,560
I'm sure you've looked at guys certain
ways when you were younger and and you'd

2980
01:32:30,561 --> 01:32:34,520
purposely looked at them in
a way to invoke a certain

2981
01:32:36,230 --> 01:32:37,370
kind of action,

2982
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:39,740
a certain kind of result,

2983
01:32:40,160 --> 01:32:40,760
fund them.

2984
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:41,021
Just,

2985
01:32:41,021 --> 01:32:45,020
just look at them in a real serious
way that you hope that we can them.

2986
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:46,273
Yeah.

2987
01:32:46,380 --> 01:32:48,530
And but because I know your background,

2988
01:32:48,710 --> 01:32:50,810
you were prepared to do
what came after that,

2989
01:32:51,620 --> 01:32:52,880
but some people aren't,

2990
01:32:54,170 --> 01:32:55,010
some people aren't.

2991
01:32:56,210 --> 01:32:59,780
And Tyson wasn't as great as he was.

2992
01:32:59,781 --> 01:33:00,614
I just said it.

2993
01:33:00,620 --> 01:33:03,200
He's great guys that hate me for today.

2994
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:04,460
Your hero or whatever,

2995
01:33:04,461 --> 01:33:05,390
your favorite guy,

2996
01:33:05,690 --> 01:33:06,710
he's great,

2997
01:33:07,850 --> 01:33:08,720
she's not great.

2998
01:33:08,721 --> 01:33:09,620
And in his area.

2999
01:33:10,520 --> 01:33:13,760
And when that moment comes,

3000
01:33:16,220 --> 01:33:17,270
you have to,

3001
01:33:17,540 --> 01:33:18,890
that's where the truth matters.

3002
01:33:19,580 --> 01:33:22,910
You have to believe that you really,

3003
01:33:22,911 --> 01:33:23,744
that guy.

3004
01:33:24,290 --> 01:33:27,260
And if you're a guy that he
lives and he was convicted.

3005
01:33:27,261 --> 01:33:28,190
So I think it's fair.

3006
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:29,450
They've raped somebody.

3007
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:30,050
Okay,

3008
01:33:30,050 --> 01:33:30,591
now listen,

3009
01:33:30,591 --> 01:33:32,420
I was in an Nav Rome and I don't know,

3010
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:33,980
a lot of people don't take okay,

3011
01:33:33,981 --> 01:33:35,150
but he was convicted or,

3012
01:33:35,330 --> 01:33:39,230
but I know enough people in the business
that there was a lot of other bad

3013
01:33:39,231 --> 01:33:43,190
things that he did that it just not things
that that you would probably want to

3014
01:33:43,191 --> 01:33:44,950
hang around with somebody if you know,

3015
01:33:44,951 --> 01:33:48,830
if you're a halfway decent human
being that he did devil week things.

3016
01:33:48,831 --> 01:33:49,131
Okay.

3017
01:33:49,131 --> 01:33:49,631
Week thing.

3018
01:33:49,631 --> 01:33:52,610
So when you do read things
and you know you did though,

3019
01:33:52,611 --> 01:33:53,444
and I don't know what,

3020
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:58,460
but I'm just saying you do week things
and you know they will week things and

3021
01:33:58,461 --> 01:34:00,200
now you got to do a strong thing.

3022
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:04,100
How do you become strong when you know
that you did those weak things and you

3023
01:34:04,101 --> 01:34:07,280
know that's really you and you've
got a guy a cause from your name,

3024
01:34:07,281 --> 01:34:11,240
Nevada Holyfield that doesn't give
a shit about how hard you punch it.

3025
01:34:11,260 --> 01:34:13,690
Does it give a crap about
what a finisher yard does?

3026
01:34:13,710 --> 01:34:16,610
It give a crap about how fair is
you put your punches together.

3027
01:34:16,790 --> 01:34:17,900
He wants to find,

3028
01:34:18,020 --> 01:34:22,250
you're going to have to make him a
believer by doing it and doing it in a

3029
01:34:22,251 --> 01:34:25,850
difficult place because he's got to make
it difficult because he ain't got to

3030
01:34:25,851 --> 01:34:26,720
cooperate.

3031
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:31,280
When that happens,

3032
01:34:32,360 --> 01:34:37,160
you got to feel like that person and
when you don't feel like that person,

3033
01:34:39,390 --> 01:34:40,223
you got a problem

3034
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:43,440
and that's what happened.

3035
01:34:43,900 --> 01:34:45,510
Wasn't a matter when he bit his ear,

3036
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:48,930
it was a matter that he was hungry and
he was a savage and he was from the

3037
01:34:48,931 --> 01:34:50,220
should stop the crap.

3038
01:34:51,930 --> 01:34:52,920
It was a way to get out

3039
01:34:55,020 --> 01:34:57,980
because he knew he wasn't
that guy and when you're not,

3040
01:34:57,980 --> 01:34:58,641
that guy goes,

3041
01:34:58,641 --> 01:35:00,080
what do you have a great talent off?

3042
01:35:00,710 --> 01:35:05,630
Recognize when somebody is
there as your greatest talent.

3043
01:35:06,530 --> 01:35:08,390
He can recognize when somebody is,

3044
01:35:09,170 --> 01:35:14,150
and he recognized that Evander Holyfield
was and I was his way to get out

3045
01:35:16,830 --> 01:35:17,700
and he did.

3046
01:35:18,150 --> 01:35:19,290
So that's why again,

3047
01:35:19,291 --> 01:35:20,310
it's not sour grapes.

3048
01:35:20,311 --> 01:35:22,350
It's really not because
I'm more selfish than that.

3049
01:35:22,650 --> 01:35:27,650
I really do care about what well my
reputation is and whether or not,

3050
01:35:28,910 --> 01:35:29,660
uh,

3051
01:35:29,660 --> 01:35:31,530
I've been honest about things I say.

3052
01:35:31,890 --> 01:35:33,690
It doesn't mean I'm right per means.

3053
01:35:33,691 --> 01:35:34,524
I believe it.

3054
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:35,880
I do care about that.

3055
01:35:37,650 --> 01:35:38,483
I do.

3056
01:35:40,290 --> 01:35:45,090
And so it's not that it
doesn't mean I'm right,

3057
01:35:45,870 --> 01:35:49,760
but it means I have a reason to
believe on right from the way of live,

3058
01:35:49,761 --> 01:35:50,581
from what I've seen,

3059
01:35:50,581 --> 01:35:53,130
what I've experienced in the business,

3060
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:54,810
the human condition,

3061
01:35:57,540 --> 01:35:59,150
how strong it can be and how we could,

3062
01:35:59,151 --> 01:35:59,984
can be.

3063
01:36:01,970 --> 01:36:02,271
And,

3064
01:36:02,271 --> 01:36:03,104
um,

3065
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:06,680
he was a strong guy is
you ever going to see?

3066
01:36:06,681 --> 01:36:10,130
But he was his week a person
as you ever going to find

3067
01:36:13,380 --> 01:36:14,220
that's intense.

3068
01:36:14,610 --> 01:36:19,470
But I see what you're saying in terms
of you are judging it by the highest

3069
01:36:19,471 --> 01:36:20,430
standards possible.

3070
01:36:20,431 --> 01:36:24,090
You're judging it in
comparison to other champions.

3071
01:36:24,750 --> 01:36:25,420
You're judging it.

3072
01:36:25,420 --> 01:36:25,760
You,

3073
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:27,350
you what else you got to
jump through with Joe.

3074
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:27,840
Yeah,

3075
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:28,673
of course.

3076
01:36:28,830 --> 01:36:29,160
Well,

3077
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:34,140
you look at guys who are known for
incredible heart and their ability to come

3078
01:36:34,141 --> 01:36:35,400
back like Diego corrals,

3079
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:36,960
Daigle,

3080
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:37,431
corrals,

3081
01:36:37,431 --> 01:36:41,040
and some of those wars when
you would say could steal.

3082
01:36:41,100 --> 01:36:41,610
Yes.

3083
01:36:41,610 --> 01:36:43,200
That was one of the
greatest fights of all time.

3084
01:36:43,201 --> 01:36:44,190
The forest of credible,

3085
01:36:44,220 --> 01:36:45,930
greatest fight of all Micky ward.

3086
01:36:46,060 --> 01:36:46,470
Arturo.

3087
01:36:46,470 --> 01:36:46,771
Gary,

3088
01:36:46,771 --> 01:36:47,371
the first one,

3089
01:36:47,371 --> 01:36:47,720
right?

3090
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:48,820
Not the second door.

3091
01:36:48,870 --> 01:36:49,471
The first,

3092
01:36:49,471 --> 01:36:50,220
the first.

3093
01:36:50,220 --> 01:36:51,053
Unbelievable.

3094
01:36:51,120 --> 01:36:51,953
Unbelievable.

3095
01:36:52,590 --> 01:36:53,220
I mean,

3096
01:36:53,220 --> 01:36:53,430
no,

3097
01:36:53,430 --> 01:36:54,330
if you want to go back,

3098
01:36:54,331 --> 01:36:55,320
if you want to go back farther,

3099
01:36:55,350 --> 01:36:56,640
most a lot of people will know this,

3100
01:36:56,641 --> 01:37:00,000
but you should call him was involved
in a lot and unfortunately he paid the

3101
01:37:00,001 --> 01:37:00,600
price.

3102
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:00,990
Okay.

3103
01:37:00,990 --> 01:37:01,590
Yes,

3104
01:37:01,590 --> 01:37:05,280
but Bobby should call it in the 70s
eighties he was involved in those fights

3105
01:37:05,281 --> 01:37:06,114
every other day.

3106
01:37:06,330 --> 01:37:06,721
You know,

3107
01:37:06,721 --> 01:37:07,321
I'm just kidding.

3108
01:37:07,321 --> 01:37:09,930
But he was invited to
many of those fights.

3109
01:37:09,931 --> 01:37:10,764
Yeah.

3110
01:37:11,310 --> 01:37:14,700
And unfortunately you don't know about
Bobby should call and you talk to

3111
01:37:14,701 --> 01:37:15,500
somebody again,

3112
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:16,890
I'm not like the baseball thing.

3113
01:37:17,220 --> 01:37:18,490
You talk about the average guy,

3114
01:37:18,630 --> 01:37:19,391
Bobby Chicago,

3115
01:37:19,391 --> 01:37:20,250
and who the hell is that?

3116
01:37:22,010 --> 01:37:26,060
Who the hell is that of course is the
guy that would know his name anymore.

3117
01:37:29,150 --> 01:37:30,280
But uh,

3118
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:32,360
he was a pretty special
guy and everything.

3119
01:37:32,450 --> 01:37:33,530
He was pretty damn tough.

3120
01:37:34,910 --> 01:37:35,930
Tougher than most people.

3121
01:37:37,750 --> 01:37:41,290
There's guys that unfortunately
relied on that toughness.

3122
01:37:41,291 --> 01:37:41,890
Right?

3123
01:37:41,890 --> 01:37:42,250
Yeah.

3124
01:37:42,250 --> 01:37:43,450
Like when you,

3125
01:37:43,451 --> 01:37:46,180
when it comes to guys
known for incredible Chins,

3126
01:37:46,660 --> 01:37:47,740
that can be a detriment.

3127
01:37:48,070 --> 01:37:48,820
Yes.

3128
01:37:48,820 --> 01:37:50,470
And it can be if that's all you have.

3129
01:37:50,860 --> 01:37:51,820
Do you think that's what you have?

3130
01:37:52,120 --> 01:37:55,000
Cause she used to put it this way cause
she used to that because he wanted me to

3131
01:37:55,140 --> 01:37:55,973
a great trainer.

3132
01:37:56,130 --> 01:37:57,600
So cause she used to always be with me.

3133
01:37:57,601 --> 01:37:58,230
All the tools,

3134
01:37:58,230 --> 01:37:58,500
you know,

3135
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:00,780
scientists and cause would say date.

3136
01:38:02,570 --> 01:38:04,020
Got Two tough guys.

3137
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:04,840
Okay,

3138
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:05,673
Gotcha.

3139
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:10,270
Now what's tough,

3140
01:38:11,510 --> 01:38:13,220
it's a prerequisite to being a fighter.

3141
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:14,930
You better be tough.

3142
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:16,070
But what Lovell,

3143
01:38:16,670 --> 01:38:17,510
so all levels,

3144
01:38:17,540 --> 01:38:19,280
degrees and I got you.

3145
01:38:19,820 --> 01:38:22,880
But how special is being tough?

3146
01:38:23,390 --> 01:38:25,130
Because if you're a fighter
you should be tough.

3147
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:25,993
I got Ya.

3148
01:38:26,330 --> 01:38:27,163
I'm listening.

3149
01:38:27,590 --> 01:38:29,210
So you got two tough guys,

3150
01:38:30,910 --> 01:38:32,110
but one of them is smart.

3151
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:34,353
Taught,

3152
01:38:35,230 --> 01:38:36,063
developed.

3153
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:40,713
That's him.

3154
01:38:41,830 --> 01:38:43,090
He's tough one now.

3155
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:44,891
That's how he explained it.

3156
01:38:44,891 --> 01:38:46,120
Tougher because he's smart.

3157
01:38:46,140 --> 01:38:46,630
Yeah.

3158
01:38:46,630 --> 01:38:48,100
Tough and smart.

3159
01:38:48,101 --> 01:38:48,451
He,

3160
01:38:48,451 --> 01:38:49,450
he goes from here,

3161
01:38:50,380 --> 01:38:54,130
he's here because he's not just
dependent only on toughness.

3162
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:55,840
So He's tougher than this guy,

3163
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:58,120
cause he don't have to
depend on just that.

3164
01:38:58,220 --> 01:38:58,660
Right.

3165
01:38:58,660 --> 01:39:00,130
You might not even have to get to it.

3166
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:02,710
It's there as a reserve.

3167
01:39:03,850 --> 01:39:06,040
It's always there to call on like an army.

3168
01:39:06,041 --> 01:39:06,701
You call on,

3169
01:39:06,701 --> 01:39:07,210
you need it.

3170
01:39:07,210 --> 01:39:07,990
Right.

3171
01:39:07,990 --> 01:39:10,600
But he's not dependent just on that.

3172
01:39:10,660 --> 01:39:11,890
Isn't that the balance though,

3173
01:39:11,980 --> 01:39:13,240
is knowing that you have it.

3174
01:39:13,420 --> 01:39:14,050
Yeah.

3175
01:39:14,050 --> 01:39:16,600
Knowing that you have it and there it is.

3176
01:39:16,601 --> 01:39:17,500
See what you just said.

3177
01:39:17,980 --> 01:39:19,360
You have to know that you it.

3178
01:39:19,480 --> 01:39:20,170
Yeah.

3179
01:39:20,170 --> 01:39:21,330
Tyson didn't know he was it.

3180
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:23,320
Were you ever admit that?

3181
01:39:23,630 --> 01:39:23,890
No.

3182
01:39:23,890 --> 01:39:25,440
He probably knocked me and say dessert,

3183
01:39:25,480 --> 01:39:25,901
whatever.

3184
01:39:25,901 --> 01:39:26,440
I don't,

3185
01:39:26,440 --> 01:39:27,370
it's okay.

3186
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:28,660
And so I get I,

3187
01:39:28,661 --> 01:39:29,494
it's okay.

3188
01:39:29,530 --> 01:39:32,450
Well there's certain people that you
can't question and the random Holyfield's

3189
01:39:32,530 --> 01:39:33,281
one of those people,

3190
01:39:33,281 --> 01:39:36,240
that's why that fight was so
fascinating because it was,

3191
01:39:36,530 --> 01:39:40,210
feel was he is a 100% warrior.

3192
01:39:40,240 --> 01:39:40,361
Well,

3193
01:39:40,361 --> 01:39:41,260
he had to write nickname.

3194
01:39:41,590 --> 01:39:42,580
Most of them don't.

3195
01:39:43,060 --> 01:39:45,850
Most of them don't have to write
fight nickname and whatever they do.

3196
01:39:45,890 --> 01:39:46,210
Right,

3197
01:39:46,210 --> 01:39:46,840
but the real,

3198
01:39:46,840 --> 01:39:47,650
the real deal,

3199
01:39:47,650 --> 01:39:48,640
he was the real deal.

3200
01:39:49,030 --> 01:39:49,390
Yeah.

3201
01:39:49,390 --> 01:39:51,340
And you know why small heavyweights,

3202
01:39:51,341 --> 01:39:52,174
you want to know why?

3203
01:39:52,750 --> 01:39:53,980
I mean trace it back,

3204
01:39:53,981 --> 01:39:57,490
cause always told me this but I
learned it in natively on my own too.

3205
01:39:58,090 --> 01:39:59,800
But trace it back to the parents,

3206
01:39:59,801 --> 01:40:03,400
trace it back to the background to
trace it back to all that stuff.

3207
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:04,900
Trace it back.

3208
01:40:05,770 --> 01:40:06,221
He did.

3209
01:40:06,221 --> 01:40:07,510
He didn't live up to something.

3210
01:40:07,511 --> 01:40:08,590
He didn't face something.

3211
01:40:08,591 --> 01:40:09,101
He didn't do.

3212
01:40:09,101 --> 01:40:09,851
Whatever it was.

3213
01:40:09,851 --> 01:40:10,630
There was about,

3214
01:40:10,630 --> 01:40:14,850
he had a mother that he talked
about a few times and I,

3215
01:40:14,851 --> 01:40:15,441
I'm sorry,

3216
01:40:15,441 --> 01:40:15,911
event of,

3217
01:40:15,911 --> 01:40:17,410
I'm not saying exact but,

3218
01:40:17,530 --> 01:40:18,790
but it's,

3219
01:40:18,910 --> 01:40:19,743
it's there

3220
01:40:21,940 --> 01:40:24,310
that and a great model obviously,

3221
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:26,590
but she,

3222
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:27,441
they had a,

3223
01:40:27,441 --> 01:40:28,660
the crop up in Georgia,

3224
01:40:28,780 --> 01:40:31,210
I think it was Atlanta of
whatever suburb of Georgia

3225
01:40:32,890 --> 01:40:33,311
and she,

3226
01:40:33,311 --> 01:40:36,730
you have definite age and know
different time down south and all that.

3227
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:38,231
Had a little,

3228
01:40:38,231 --> 01:40:42,400
I guess a little shack in the back
with a thing called twitches switch.

3229
01:40:42,401 --> 01:40:42,941
It switches,

3230
01:40:42,941 --> 01:40:43,774
I'm sorry,

3231
01:40:44,350 --> 01:40:45,183
I'm twitching

3232
01:40:48,820 --> 01:40:49,653
switches.

3233
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:52,113
And

3234
01:40:53,560 --> 01:40:54,460
she basically

3235
01:40:54,460 --> 01:40:55,870
had different size switches,

3236
01:40:55,900 --> 01:40:56,733
you know,

3237
01:40:56,830 --> 01:40:57,521
short ones,

3238
01:40:57,521 --> 01:40:58,091
long ones,

3239
01:40:58,091 --> 01:41:00,520
medium ones depending on the occasion.

3240
01:41:01,660 --> 01:41:05,830
And when he didn't live up to
what he had to tell the truth,

3241
01:41:05,900 --> 01:41:06,521
whatever,

3242
01:41:06,521 --> 01:41:07,750
be accountable gay

3243
01:41:09,940 --> 01:41:11,680
face where he had to face whatever,

3244
01:41:12,490 --> 01:41:13,030
um,

3245
01:41:13,030 --> 01:41:18,010
she had a switch for him and you know what

3246
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:20,913
it um,

3247
01:41:21,250 --> 01:41:24,280
informed him cause he faced things.

3248
01:41:24,580 --> 01:41:25,413
Tyson,

3249
01:41:25,510 --> 01:41:29,690
Tyson on the other hand to listen
did he asked for it and now my,

3250
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:30,970
he didn't ask for that upbringing.

3251
01:41:31,210 --> 01:41:32,043
I get it.

3252
01:41:33,050 --> 01:41:35,950
But I know people have that upbringing
and they get to a point they can,

3253
01:41:37,210 --> 01:41:38,940
they can make a left
turn instead of a writer.

3254
01:41:39,900 --> 01:41:41,380
Is your ability to make a choice.

3255
01:41:41,381 --> 01:41:42,610
There's also the,

3256
01:41:42,611 --> 01:41:47,350
the overwhelming hype and celebrity
involved in Mike Tyson in his prime,

3257
01:41:47,351 --> 01:41:50,020
it was probably so difficult for
them to even understand himself.

3258
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:50,890
Yeah.

3259
01:41:50,890 --> 01:41:51,131
But,

3260
01:41:51,131 --> 01:41:52,570
but what he did understand,

3261
01:41:52,990 --> 01:41:53,980
and I'm glad you said that

3262
01:41:56,820 --> 01:41:57,720
right backwards,

3263
01:41:58,020 --> 01:42:00,870
what he did and what he did understand

3264
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:06,000
was there was a way out of Anda learned.

3265
01:42:06,010 --> 01:42:06,860
There was no way out,

3266
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:09,010
you know,

3267
01:42:09,010 --> 01:42:09,621
put those away.

3268
01:42:09,621 --> 01:42:10,431
And you know what I mean?

3269
01:42:10,431 --> 01:42:10,630
Right.

3270
01:42:10,630 --> 01:42:11,330
Yeah.

3271
01:42:11,330 --> 01:42:16,280
Somebody would come and pay and he did a
lot of things before he became champion

3272
01:42:16,550 --> 01:42:21,550
and somebody was always there with a check
or cash or whatever and would absolve

3273
01:42:22,161 --> 01:42:22,551
them from,

3274
01:42:22,551 --> 01:42:23,150
it would,

3275
01:42:23,150 --> 01:42:24,620
would not have to face what he did.

3276
01:42:24,660 --> 01:42:25,060
Right.

3277
01:42:25,060 --> 01:42:25,450
And,

3278
01:42:25,450 --> 01:42:25,880
and,

3279
01:42:25,880 --> 01:42:30,880
but there was a switch that Amanda had
to face and that's what made him what had

3280
01:42:30,921 --> 01:42:31,754
made him.

3281
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:34,280
And that's what allowed Tyson
part of would move loud.

3282
01:42:34,310 --> 01:42:35,030
Tyson,

3283
01:42:35,030 --> 01:42:35,900
you look,

3284
01:42:35,901 --> 01:42:37,700
you make your own choices
at a certain point in life.

3285
01:42:37,850 --> 01:42:39,410
So there's not make too many excuses,

3286
01:42:39,411 --> 01:42:42,130
but it is part of it that,

3287
01:42:42,210 --> 01:42:47,210
that he was formed by what he was
allowed to do when he shouldn't have been

3288
01:42:47,931 --> 01:42:48,980
allowed to do those things.

3289
01:42:48,990 --> 01:42:50,810
So that was one of the issues
that you had with costs,

3290
01:42:50,811 --> 01:42:51,140
right?

3291
01:42:51,140 --> 01:42:51,973
Yeah.

3292
01:42:52,820 --> 01:42:57,770
That you felt like cus was ignoring his
own principles and teaching because this

3293
01:42:57,771 --> 01:42:58,850
guy was so special.

3294
01:42:58,970 --> 01:42:59,300
Yeah.

3295
01:42:59,300 --> 01:43:03,110
And cause he was getting older and cass
recognize you didn't have much time left

3296
01:43:03,111 --> 01:43:05,750
in this guy had a legitimate shot at
being a world champion and for cause

3297
01:43:05,751 --> 01:43:09,230
everything in his June or everything
in the world of boxing success.

3298
01:43:09,231 --> 01:43:09,681
And everything.

3299
01:43:09,681 --> 01:43:10,191
He was great.

3300
01:43:10,191 --> 01:43:12,200
He was special because his whole life,

3301
01:43:12,201 --> 01:43:15,150
he didn't get married for a reason
because he was married to box.

3302
01:43:15,151 --> 01:43:16,970
And as he said that it wouldn't been fair.

3303
01:43:17,180 --> 01:43:21,140
I mean this was a different guy
that it was boxing his whole life.

3304
01:43:21,170 --> 01:43:22,003
Everything.

3305
01:43:22,100 --> 01:43:26,780
Life was boxing and lessons
were connected to boxing,

3306
01:43:27,950 --> 01:43:28,700
everything.

3307
01:43:28,700 --> 01:43:29,533
And um,

3308
01:43:29,990 --> 01:43:31,460
principals boxing.

3309
01:43:32,750 --> 01:43:33,583
And uh,

3310
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:35,440
so there's,

3311
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:36,273
uh,

3312
01:43:37,310 --> 01:43:39,080
there's a guy that his whole,

3313
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:39,621
you know,

3314
01:43:39,621 --> 01:43:41,120
you used that word legacy,

3315
01:43:41,690 --> 01:43:45,380
but really his whole existence was boxing.

3316
01:43:45,410 --> 01:43:47,930
And for him it was heavyweight champs.

3317
01:43:47,931 --> 01:43:49,070
He had Floyd Patterson,

3318
01:43:49,430 --> 01:43:50,870
youngest heavyweight champ ever.

3319
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:51,793
That was cost.

3320
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:54,500
That was because it
was about lightweights.

3321
01:43:54,501 --> 01:43:54,891
Lizard.

3322
01:43:54,891 --> 01:43:55,641
He had lightweights.

3323
01:43:55,641 --> 01:43:56,510
He had welterweights,

3324
01:43:56,511 --> 01:43:57,344
Jose Torres,

3325
01:43:57,530 --> 01:43:58,191
Jose toys,

3326
01:43:58,191 --> 01:43:59,240
light heavyweight champion.

3327
01:43:59,241 --> 01:44:00,080
Exactly right.

3328
01:44:00,081 --> 01:44:00,920
He had other guys too.

3329
01:44:01,190 --> 01:44:04,700
But it was the heavyweight champion of
the world because it was around where we

3330
01:44:04,701 --> 01:44:07,400
talked about before when
box was the biggest sport,

3331
01:44:07,401 --> 01:44:08,330
bigger than baseball.

3332
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:12,890
And it was the heavyweight champ of the
world was Babe Ruth was rocky Marciano

3333
01:44:14,110 --> 01:44:14,943
and that,

3334
01:44:14,970 --> 01:44:19,970
and you're going to say that before you
leave this earth that you have a chance

3335
01:44:21,320 --> 01:44:23,720
to have another heavyweight
champ that might be the best,

3336
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:27,710
could be one of the best ever and
could break Patterson's record,

3337
01:44:27,711 --> 01:44:28,970
which was part of the plan,

3338
01:44:29,330 --> 01:44:30,260
part of the plan.

3339
01:44:30,261 --> 01:44:31,280
When costs was alive,

3340
01:44:31,490 --> 01:44:32,930
you're going to break Patterson's reg.

3341
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:33,793
He broke it,

3342
01:44:34,070 --> 01:44:35,930
he became the youngest
heavyweight champion.

3343
01:44:37,160 --> 01:44:40,430
And so when you float that out there,

3344
01:44:40,670 --> 01:44:41,503
if you will,

3345
01:44:41,620 --> 01:44:41,921
and,

3346
01:44:41,921 --> 01:44:43,280
and tempt a guy with that,

3347
01:44:43,970 --> 01:44:48,860
even a great guy like cause some
things are going to be pushed aside.

3348
01:44:49,130 --> 01:44:49,810
And Ethan,

3349
01:44:49,810 --> 01:44:50,030
yeah,

3350
01:44:50,030 --> 01:44:50,690
compromised.

3351
01:44:50,690 --> 01:44:51,523
And he did.

3352
01:44:52,460 --> 01:44:55,880
Do you think if he didn't do that the
Tyson would have been a different person?

3353
01:44:57,060 --> 01:44:57,893
Okay,

3354
01:44:58,040 --> 01:45:03,040
I'm going to use his words there
was told to me by great promoter,

3355
01:45:03,380 --> 01:45:04,700
Mickey toppy passed away.

3356
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:10,280
It was close to Jim Jacobs who was close
to cause and he was up there sometimes

3357
01:45:10,281 --> 01:45:11,420
after I left and all that.

3358
01:45:11,630 --> 01:45:15,440
And Mickey wanted me to train all those
fighters and he was a great promoter.

3359
01:45:15,441 --> 01:45:16,274
Mickey.

3360
01:45:16,790 --> 01:45:17,720
He had great sayings.

3361
01:45:17,721 --> 01:45:18,710
He was a very witty guy,

3362
01:45:18,711 --> 01:45:20,000
but he was a sharp guy.

3363
01:45:20,420 --> 01:45:21,650
Boxing was his life too.

3364
01:45:22,370 --> 01:45:24,710
And he ran everything in
London with three partners.

3365
01:45:25,340 --> 01:45:27,980
One of them was Java sustain
who owned Wembley Stadium.

3366
01:45:27,981 --> 01:45:28,970
So they were powerful.

3367
01:45:29,450 --> 01:45:30,350
They ran everything.

3368
01:45:30,500 --> 01:45:34,700
They were the cartel in
London back in those days.

3369
01:45:36,050 --> 01:45:40,410
He told me that before cost died,

3370
01:45:40,760 --> 01:45:44,900
that cause had said some nice
things about teddy atlas,

3371
01:45:46,850 --> 01:45:48,850
but he said and loads,

3372
01:45:48,860 --> 01:45:51,230
I know there's a danger
that this can be convenient.

3373
01:45:51,710 --> 01:45:53,540
You know what it means self serving crap.

3374
01:45:55,580 --> 01:45:57,260
Sometimes you got to trust whatever.

3375
01:45:58,580 --> 01:46:02,150
I was told by Mickey that he said that

3376
01:46:03,930 --> 01:46:06,220
Teddy Atlas was right by the way,

3377
01:46:06,221 --> 01:46:06,931
was wrong,

3378
01:46:06,931 --> 01:46:11,931
was who's going to get in a way of the
possibility of making a great fighter.

3379
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:16,513
Um,

3380
01:46:16,860 --> 01:46:19,810
if he did things his way as
far as the disciplining in the,

3381
01:46:20,150 --> 01:46:20,461
you know,

3382
01:46:20,461 --> 01:46:21,294
whatever.

3383
01:46:21,480 --> 01:46:21,980
Um,

3384
01:46:21,980 --> 01:46:22,620
eve,

3385
01:46:22,620 --> 01:46:23,453
in other words,

3386
01:46:23,490 --> 01:46:25,110
whether he left it like that,

3387
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:26,273
so I don't know.

3388
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:31,400
So I know what I think it meant that
Thaisa wouldn't have been around if you

3389
01:46:31,621 --> 01:46:31,980
did,

3390
01:46:31,980 --> 01:46:32,810
if discipline,

3391
01:46:32,810 --> 01:46:33,631
that he would have laughed.

3392
01:46:33,631 --> 01:46:37,080
I don't know because I don't know that
he had those options because he was a

3393
01:46:37,081 --> 01:46:38,730
ward of the state and,

3394
01:46:38,731 --> 01:46:39,060
uh,

3395
01:46:39,060 --> 01:46:39,301
you know,

3396
01:46:39,301 --> 01:46:44,301
it was coming out of obviously a
criminal situation who's coming out of a

3397
01:46:44,610 --> 01:46:48,210
juvenile detention center
called Trion up outside of old,

3398
01:46:48,211 --> 01:46:49,590
30 miles outside Albany.

3399
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:50,993
Um,

3400
01:46:51,320 --> 01:46:51,661
you know,

3401
01:46:51,661 --> 01:46:53,130
so I don't know that he had,

3402
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:56,400
but basically that if
teddy did it his way,

3403
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:57,630
he was right.

3404
01:46:57,630 --> 01:47:00,930
But he was wrong because it would have
ruined the possibility of a great fighter

3405
01:47:01,680 --> 01:47:03,480
and I couldn't let that happen.

3406
01:47:03,990 --> 01:47:06,480
So I don't think that it's,

3407
01:47:06,810 --> 01:47:07,980
I don't know if it's true,

3408
01:47:07,981 --> 01:47:08,431
actually.

3409
01:47:08,431 --> 01:47:09,264
I don't know.

3410
01:47:09,390 --> 01:47:10,770
You know what I was about to say?

3411
01:47:11,010 --> 01:47:14,400
I don't think that's true
because of course it's me,

3412
01:47:14,780 --> 01:47:15,120
right?

3413
01:47:15,120 --> 01:47:16,620
I want to make myself feel good.

3414
01:47:17,430 --> 01:47:19,550
So I want to say you could
have the best of both worlds.

3415
01:47:19,551 --> 01:47:19,771
We good.

3416
01:47:19,771 --> 01:47:24,030
We had maybe a better person or
within the realm of a better person,

3417
01:47:24,031 --> 01:47:24,271
right.

3418
01:47:24,271 --> 01:47:24,811
Boundaries,

3419
01:47:24,811 --> 01:47:25,021
right.

3420
01:47:25,021 --> 01:47:25,920
There were no boundaries.

3421
01:47:26,160 --> 01:47:28,530
Maybe there would have those boundaries
would have made a difference.

3422
01:47:28,531 --> 01:47:29,160
Right.

3423
01:47:29,160 --> 01:47:30,510
And you still would have had the talent.

3424
01:47:30,570 --> 01:47:34,560
He was so at the talent wasn't going to
dissipate because I have to discipline,

3425
01:47:34,860 --> 01:47:35,131
you know,

3426
01:47:35,131 --> 01:47:36,900
that you put on them as a human being.

3427
01:47:37,980 --> 01:47:39,030
That wasn't going to change.

3428
01:47:39,750 --> 01:47:40,730
But um,

3429
01:47:40,840 --> 01:47:44,460
because because we're saying
that it wasn't going to happen.

3430
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:45,960
Maybe you'll lose them.

3431
01:47:46,380 --> 01:47:48,990
Maybe it goes to someone else at a
certain point in his development.

3432
01:47:49,020 --> 01:47:49,831
Maybe that's what he meant.

3433
01:47:49,831 --> 01:47:50,664
I don't know.

3434
01:47:50,850 --> 01:47:50,991
Well,

3435
01:47:50,991 --> 01:47:52,400
you had that with Shannon kitchen.

3436
01:47:52,410 --> 01:47:53,243
Shannon Briggs.

3437
01:47:53,880 --> 01:47:54,151
Yeah.

3438
01:47:54,151 --> 01:47:54,721
Shannon brings,

3439
01:47:54,721 --> 01:47:56,130
came from Brownsville and he was,

3440
01:47:56,700 --> 01:47:59,970
I had him as a young developing program.

3441
01:47:59,971 --> 01:48:01,020
We got to a certain point.

3442
01:48:01,050 --> 01:48:01,190
Oh,

3443
01:48:01,190 --> 01:48:05,080
you also had that situation with him
where you felt like he wasn't 100% in,

3444
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:08,440
he wasn't doing the things
you wanted him to do.

3445
01:48:08,890 --> 01:48:09,550
He was,

3446
01:48:09,550 --> 01:48:13,750
he was lacking in a certain amount of
discipline or he was distracted in a

3447
01:48:13,751 --> 01:48:17,170
certain amount of ways that bothered you
to the point where you didn't want to

3448
01:48:17,171 --> 01:48:18,004
work with them anymore.

3449
01:48:19,560 --> 01:48:20,371
It wasn't committed,

3450
01:48:20,371 --> 01:48:21,510
I didn't think completely.

3451
01:48:21,511 --> 01:48:21,990
But,

3452
01:48:21,990 --> 01:48:22,620
uh,

3453
01:48:22,620 --> 01:48:23,640
he was a smart kid.

3454
01:48:23,880 --> 01:48:24,750
Take your kid.

3455
01:48:25,380 --> 01:48:25,980
Talented,

3456
01:48:25,980 --> 01:48:26,581
talented,

3457
01:48:26,581 --> 01:48:27,414
very talented,

3458
01:48:27,750 --> 01:48:28,351
smart,

3459
01:48:28,351 --> 01:48:28,591
you know,

3460
01:48:28,591 --> 01:48:29,850
he knew how to market himself.

3461
01:48:29,851 --> 01:48:32,910
He had to dreadlocks and he
made them orange and you know,

3462
01:48:32,940 --> 01:48:37,940
nobody was doing that back then and he
could punch it was talented and he looked

3463
01:48:38,641 --> 01:48:38,851
good,

3464
01:48:38,851 --> 01:48:39,270
you know?

3465
01:48:39,270 --> 01:48:40,103
Yeah.

3466
01:48:40,710 --> 01:48:41,543
Um,

3467
01:48:43,910 --> 01:48:44,930
but it's real commitment.

3468
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:46,040
I didn't think because then,

3469
01:48:46,041 --> 01:48:49,610
and maybe in the two to
his credit he had other,

3470
01:48:49,940 --> 01:48:51,530
he was smart and he
thought of other things,

3471
01:48:51,531 --> 01:48:52,364
but

3472
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:55,190
he never really bought in

3473
01:48:56,940 --> 01:49:00,200
that this is the end all was boxing that,

3474
01:49:00,201 --> 01:49:00,800
that,

3475
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:02,540
that was the complete,

3476
01:49:02,810 --> 01:49:05,930
I don't want to use just as average,

3477
01:49:05,931 --> 01:49:08,030
same standard word.

3478
01:49:08,150 --> 01:49:08,983
Commitment,

3479
01:49:09,030 --> 01:49:09,550
right?

3480
01:49:09,550 --> 01:49:12,020
Like what the figures that
sometimes like commitment,

3481
01:49:12,200 --> 01:49:13,033
but

3482
01:49:14,660 --> 01:49:15,710
more than commitment.

3483
01:49:17,300 --> 01:49:20,930
He said all the right things because
they had investors and they had different

3484
01:49:20,931 --> 01:49:21,220
people.

3485
01:49:21,220 --> 01:49:22,160
It's their bad thing.

3486
01:49:22,161 --> 01:49:22,994
Everyone does.

3487
01:49:23,390 --> 01:49:24,370
If you're talented enough,

3488
01:49:24,380 --> 01:49:25,850
you draw those kinds of things.

3489
01:49:26,060 --> 01:49:27,020
To his credit,

3490
01:49:28,100 --> 01:49:29,030
he deserved it.

3491
01:49:29,210 --> 01:49:34,190
He did something to bring
investors and people to back them,

3492
01:49:35,030 --> 01:49:37,850
but he got so used to saying
what they needed to hear

3493
01:49:39,380 --> 01:49:41,990
that he never knew what he needed to hear.

3494
01:49:41,991 --> 01:49:42,824
He never,

3495
01:49:42,950 --> 01:49:47,950
he and what he needed to hear and
believe was that I'm really gonna do

3496
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:48,101
it.

3497
01:49:48,101 --> 01:49:52,720
He got so good at selling it that
he never got good at buying it.

3498
01:49:55,280 --> 01:49:56,380
He never really,

3499
01:49:56,990 --> 01:50:00,520
he just thought that I
ride this train and tool

3500
01:50:02,670 --> 01:50:03,630
I write is trained to,

3501
01:50:03,631 --> 01:50:07,800
I fall off or tore comes off
to track or to comes to stop,

3502
01:50:07,980 --> 01:50:11,490
but it is going to come to a stop and
I'm not saying everyone can have that

3503
01:50:11,491 --> 01:50:11,941
confidence.

3504
01:50:11,941 --> 01:50:12,960
Everyone can have that belief.

3505
01:50:12,961 --> 01:50:13,890
I'm not saying that,

3506
01:50:14,130 --> 01:50:15,390
but you have to get it somewhere.

3507
01:50:15,480 --> 01:50:18,900
Sometime he didn't believe that
the train was really going here.

3508
01:50:19,230 --> 01:50:22,980
He believed that it was just going to
go to a place where it was going to be

3509
01:50:22,981 --> 01:50:27,210
better than where he was and
that that he'll ride it as long,

3510
01:50:27,211 --> 01:50:27,600
but he,

3511
01:50:27,600 --> 01:50:29,940
he's not committed to staying on it.

3512
01:50:30,480 --> 01:50:31,320
It when,

3513
01:50:31,890 --> 01:50:32,191
when,

3514
01:50:32,191 --> 01:50:32,910
uh,

3515
01:50:32,910 --> 01:50:36,810
when it turns come up and
it gets a little fast,

3516
01:50:37,150 --> 01:50:39,660
he doesn't believe that he's
really going to get there.

3517
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:41,640
He believes that when that first turn,

3518
01:50:41,641 --> 01:50:42,391
second turn,

3519
01:50:42,391 --> 01:50:43,224
third turn,

3520
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:46,410
whatever on a rails coms
that that's going to be it,

3521
01:50:46,530 --> 01:50:47,280
but it's going to be,

3522
01:50:47,280 --> 01:50:49,560
it took a better place than he was at it.

3523
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:52,410
Earned him some money and
got him some things and,

3524
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:53,310
and it was good,

3525
01:50:53,400 --> 01:50:54,990
but he never really,

3526
01:50:55,280 --> 01:50:56,370
there's that word committed,

3527
01:50:56,520 --> 01:51:00,630
but he never really believed
and a lot of people don't.

3528
01:51:00,631 --> 01:51:02,160
They find their way along the way,

3529
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:07,760
but he never believed that what he told
the people around them that he was going

3530
01:51:10,031 --> 01:51:10,864
to be,

3531
01:51:10,950 --> 01:51:15,030
he never believed that his
personality was too good.

3532
01:51:15,420 --> 01:51:17,100
His personality was too sharp.

3533
01:51:17,440 --> 01:51:17,880
He,

3534
01:51:17,880 --> 01:51:18,490
he,

3535
01:51:18,490 --> 01:51:18,960
he,

3536
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:23,250
he could say all the right things and
became easier to say the right things then

3537
01:51:23,251 --> 01:51:24,570
to believe the right thing.

3538
01:51:24,571 --> 01:51:25,404
Does that make sense?

3539
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:26,290
It does make sense.

3540
01:51:26,380 --> 01:51:29,410
This uncompromising
psychology of combat sports,

3541
01:51:29,470 --> 01:51:31,210
this uncompromising philosophy.

3542
01:51:31,420 --> 01:51:34,420
Is this something that you got from
costs as is something that you inherently

3543
01:51:34,421 --> 01:51:38,920
understood from working closely with these
guys and taking them to these smokers

3544
01:51:38,921 --> 01:51:39,940
in the South Bronx?

3545
01:51:40,180 --> 01:51:41,200
Where does this come from?

3546
01:51:42,540 --> 01:51:43,060
Okay.

3547
01:51:43,060 --> 01:51:45,400
Just raw honesty scene at all.

3548
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:47,010
Listen,

3549
01:51:47,010 --> 01:51:47,860
the comes from,

3550
01:51:48,250 --> 01:51:48,581
again,

3551
01:51:48,581 --> 01:51:49,990
you don't want to be Corny,

3552
01:51:49,991 --> 01:51:52,210
but it comes from live in a certain way.

3553
01:51:52,211 --> 01:51:55,420
Life was seeing things
traveling today as part of it.

3554
01:51:56,110 --> 01:51:56,830
Definitely.

3555
01:51:56,830 --> 01:51:58,900
But the,

3556
01:51:59,790 --> 01:52:01,110
the articulation of it,

3557
01:52:03,010 --> 01:52:08,010
the blueprint or map of it to seeing of
the visualization of it on paper comes

3558
01:52:08,441 --> 01:52:09,274
from costs.

3559
01:52:10,180 --> 01:52:10,961
Who's a genius?

3560
01:52:10,961 --> 01:52:12,040
Who was Devon's his world.

3561
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:13,241
The,

3562
01:52:13,241 --> 01:52:14,320
the theory of it,

3563
01:52:14,530 --> 01:52:15,400
that's the better way.

3564
01:52:16,450 --> 01:52:19,570
The theory of it comes
from [inaudible] to living.

3565
01:52:19,571 --> 01:52:21,160
The doing of it comes from my father.

3566
01:52:22,450 --> 01:52:26,590
I had a father that most box
and people don't come from,

3567
01:52:26,650 --> 01:52:29,170
although parroted great Mexican fighter,

3568
01:52:29,171 --> 01:52:31,150
but he came from something like that.

3569
01:52:31,151 --> 01:52:31,984
He was,

3570
01:52:32,200 --> 01:52:33,550
he wanted to be a lawyer actually.

3571
01:52:33,551 --> 01:52:34,091
But anyway,

3572
01:52:34,091 --> 01:52:34,960
and you'd think Mexico,

3573
01:52:34,961 --> 01:52:36,250
you'd think why he came from the,

3574
01:52:36,550 --> 01:52:36,851
you know,

3575
01:52:36,851 --> 01:52:37,130
the,

3576
01:52:37,130 --> 01:52:37,860
the,

3577
01:52:37,860 --> 01:52:41,260
the dirt floors and the stuff which
a lot of guys come from and you know,

3578
01:52:41,261 --> 01:52:43,540
they pull them cell phone
and that's part of the,

3579
01:52:43,660 --> 01:52:45,010
obviously the motivation.

3580
01:52:45,380 --> 01:52:46,213
But

3581
01:52:49,520 --> 01:52:50,810
my father was a doctor.

3582
01:52:51,680 --> 01:52:52,850
It was a GP practice,

3583
01:52:52,851 --> 01:52:53,690
55 years.

3584
01:52:54,680 --> 01:52:55,030
Stan,

3585
01:52:55,030 --> 01:52:55,611
our New York,

3586
01:52:55,611 --> 01:52:57,410
again from the Bronx Santa,

3587
01:52:59,480 --> 01:53:00,800
he founded two hospitals.

3588
01:53:02,150 --> 01:53:03,980
He built a house for 22 beds in,

3589
01:53:03,981 --> 01:53:05,270
it was called sunny side some,

3590
01:53:05,271 --> 01:53:07,880
I don't know if that stuff even
existed in Google back then,

3591
01:53:07,881 --> 01:53:08,720
but anyway,

3592
01:53:08,721 --> 01:53:12,890
with Sunnyside hospital
and he built it so that

3593
01:53:14,990 --> 01:53:15,890
all people,

3594
01:53:16,460 --> 01:53:17,260
I listened,

3595
01:53:17,260 --> 01:53:17,811
he builds it.

3596
01:53:17,811 --> 01:53:18,860
So poor people,

3597
01:53:19,350 --> 01:53:19,771
he was,

3598
01:53:19,771 --> 01:53:21,080
he grew up very poor.

3599
01:53:22,610 --> 01:53:23,443
He,

3600
01:53:23,450 --> 01:53:24,283
he just,

3601
01:53:24,320 --> 01:53:27,230
he was in that kind of
allow is because he just,

3602
01:53:28,250 --> 01:53:33,250
he built his hospital so that the less
of people with less could get hospital

3603
01:53:36,141 --> 01:53:38,630
care because back in those
days there were no HR moles.

3604
01:53:38,660 --> 01:53:39,800
There was no Obamacare,

3605
01:53:39,830 --> 01:53:40,663
there was no,

3606
01:53:40,760 --> 01:53:41,031
you know,

3607
01:53:41,031 --> 01:53:41,870
whether you think it's good,

3608
01:53:41,871 --> 01:53:42,381
it's bad.

3609
01:53:42,381 --> 01:53:43,280
It said it doesn't matter.

3610
01:53:43,281 --> 01:53:46,490
There was nothing he wound up
in a clinic may be you got,

3611
01:53:46,710 --> 01:53:46,870
well,

3612
01:53:46,870 --> 01:53:51,200
unless you had a doctor
that that took k and he was,

3613
01:53:51,201 --> 01:53:52,160
and who are the doctors?

3614
01:53:52,160 --> 01:53:53,210
He wasn't the only one,

3615
01:53:54,320 --> 01:53:56,090
but he was the only one I know.

3616
01:53:56,990 --> 01:54:01,990
And he founded Sunnyside hospital for 22
beds in her lesson about 25 years until

3617
01:54:03,290 --> 01:54:04,760
the Verrazano Bridge was built.

3618
01:54:05,870 --> 01:54:08,000
The city put the highway in there.

3619
01:54:08,510 --> 01:54:09,051
It changed,

3620
01:54:09,051 --> 01:54:09,590
sat down.

3621
01:54:09,590 --> 01:54:10,161
Obviously,

3622
01:54:10,161 --> 01:54:13,490
if it connected pro-Clinton stand out
and you didn't have to take a ferry boat.

3623
01:54:14,270 --> 01:54:15,980
And He,

3624
01:54:15,981 --> 01:54:16,814
um,

3625
01:54:17,870 --> 01:54:22,870
the city border farmer and then he went
and found a doctor's hospital with 60

3626
01:54:23,511 --> 01:54:24,171
other doctors,

3627
01:54:24,171 --> 01:54:25,520
but he was the original founder,

3628
01:54:25,940 --> 01:54:27,890
him and a guy named doctor Tim Pawn Sr.

3629
01:54:28,700 --> 01:54:30,140
He founded doctors,

3630
01:54:30,141 --> 01:54:31,260
which was a big hospital.

3631
01:54:31,290 --> 01:54:32,180
I said 30 years.

3632
01:54:32,181 --> 01:54:33,350
There was a big hospital,

3633
01:54:33,650 --> 01:54:34,483
but,

3634
01:54:34,910 --> 01:54:39,910
so he was a guy that he didn't waste
time telling me how to live and how all

3635
01:54:42,591 --> 01:54:43,424
that stuff,

3636
01:54:43,610 --> 01:54:45,900
the only thing I remember
was you say some do.

3637
01:54:45,901 --> 01:54:46,734
It

3638
01:54:48,110 --> 01:54:48,411
was,

3639
01:54:48,411 --> 01:54:49,244
I mean,

3640
01:54:49,520 --> 01:54:52,220
and then I watched him as a kid.

3641
01:54:52,220 --> 01:54:53,090
He was my hero.

3642
01:54:53,750 --> 01:54:53,991
I mean,

3643
01:54:53,991 --> 01:54:54,970
I liked Mickey Mann.

3644
01:54:54,980 --> 01:54:55,121
Oh.

3645
01:54:55,121 --> 01:54:56,510
And I liked Cholo is,

3646
01:54:56,511 --> 01:54:56,841
you know,

3647
01:54:56,841 --> 01:55:00,200
all those things and
it's like any other kid.

3648
01:55:00,950 --> 01:55:02,210
But if I had a hero,

3649
01:55:02,211 --> 01:55:03,650
I didn't know what a hero was.

3650
01:55:03,860 --> 01:55:05,240
Am I going to make believe I knew,

3651
01:55:05,420 --> 01:55:07,490
but I know now what it's supposed to mean.

3652
01:55:07,491 --> 01:55:08,324
Right.

3653
01:55:08,510 --> 01:55:10,010
So he was my,

3654
01:55:11,930 --> 01:55:13,310
and I just,

3655
01:55:14,780 --> 01:55:15,770
I watched him,

3656
01:55:17,510 --> 01:55:17,901
you know,

3657
01:55:17,901 --> 01:55:22,901
when I went in his room one
time when he graduated Nyu,

3658
01:55:24,621 --> 01:55:25,401
they didn't have money,

3659
01:55:25,401 --> 01:55:26,580
so he had to get scholarship.

3660
01:55:26,581 --> 01:55:27,860
He had to get help from different teams,

3661
01:55:28,040 --> 01:55:29,030
whatever they had to do.

3662
01:55:29,690 --> 01:55:31,160
But he got,

3663
01:55:31,370 --> 01:55:33,350
he went to Nyu medical school,

3664
01:55:33,380 --> 01:55:34,580
Nyu Undergrad,

3665
01:55:35,450 --> 01:55:36,830
and then he interned at Bellevue,

3666
01:55:36,831 --> 01:55:39,170
which he wasn't a big talker,

3667
01:55:39,200 --> 01:55:40,033
but he told me,

3668
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:41,000
he did tell me,

3669
01:55:41,270 --> 01:55:42,530
when you graduated Bellevue,

3670
01:55:42,531 --> 01:55:43,530
you were ready thing.

3671
01:55:44,130 --> 01:55:45,540
So of later in my life,

3672
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:47,700
I took that as the South Bronx.

3673
01:55:48,570 --> 01:55:50,660
You graduated to South Bronx to smokers.

3674
01:55:50,720 --> 01:55:51,690
You were very funny thing.

3675
01:55:52,200 --> 01:55:54,120
You learned that you're
ready for anything.

3676
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:55,140
You learn how to match,

3677
01:55:55,141 --> 01:55:55,974
make you ready.

3678
01:55:56,100 --> 01:55:57,200
You'll learn how to be a trainer.

3679
01:55:57,310 --> 01:55:58,290
You ready fairy thing.

3680
01:55:58,680 --> 01:55:59,760
So he,

3681
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:01,881
you know,

3682
01:56:01,881 --> 01:56:02,210
he,

3683
01:56:02,210 --> 01:56:03,043
he came,

3684
01:56:03,780 --> 01:56:04,613
he,

3685
01:56:04,660 --> 01:56:06,560
I did knock on his door when he was,

3686
01:56:06,980 --> 01:56:09,200
what it was in turning
a Bellevue of young guy.

3687
01:56:09,201 --> 01:56:10,034
You know,

3688
01:56:10,310 --> 01:56:14,690
apparently he saved some obese woman's
life that had a heart attack in the

3689
01:56:14,691 --> 01:56:15,524
street.

3690
01:56:15,980 --> 01:56:16,761
He dragged,

3691
01:56:16,761 --> 01:56:17,810
dragged her off the street,

3692
01:56:17,811 --> 01:56:18,261
whatever,

3693
01:56:18,261 --> 01:56:18,830
the,

3694
01:56:18,830 --> 01:56:20,030
you never get the whole story,

3695
01:56:20,510 --> 01:56:23,780
but he saved a life and

3696
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:29,090
he developed a hernia at a
grown to a double hernia.

3697
01:56:29,091 --> 01:56:30,500
And my father was a kind of guy.

3698
01:56:30,620 --> 01:56:33,200
He didn't let anything
interfere with his patients,

3699
01:56:33,201 --> 01:56:34,034
his work,

3700
01:56:34,190 --> 01:56:35,390
he didn't take time to get it.

3701
01:56:35,540 --> 01:56:38,030
So he carried it for 30
years and he finally got it,

3702
01:56:38,200 --> 01:56:38,870
you know,

3703
01:56:38,870 --> 01:56:40,460
and so it become a double hernia.

3704
01:56:40,610 --> 01:56:41,720
I know hernia is now.

3705
01:56:41,721 --> 01:56:43,790
They do the mash and
they do lays in there.

3706
01:56:43,910 --> 01:56:46,250
But in those days it was
a more serious thing.

3707
01:56:46,610 --> 01:56:48,110
He was evasive surgery.

3708
01:56:48,530 --> 01:56:49,363
Um,

3709
01:56:49,580 --> 01:56:50,450
it was different.

3710
01:56:51,430 --> 01:56:52,250
It was,

3711
01:56:52,250 --> 01:56:53,660
and it was painful apparently.

3712
01:56:55,130 --> 01:56:56,600
And uh,

3713
01:56:57,620 --> 01:56:59,510
I did knock on a door as a young kid,

3714
01:56:59,840 --> 01:57:00,673
you know,

3715
01:57:00,770 --> 01:57:01,510
very young,

3716
01:57:01,510 --> 01:57:02,420
but I still remember,

3717
01:57:03,200 --> 01:57:08,200
and it was a mirror here and he was over
there near his bed when the mirror was

3718
01:57:09,021 --> 01:57:09,470
here.

3719
01:57:09,470 --> 01:57:13,040
So I opened the door and in the
huck should have knocked obviously.

3720
01:57:13,460 --> 01:57:14,293
And um,

3721
01:57:14,300 --> 01:57:16,730
I saw he was bent over in pain.

3722
01:57:16,940 --> 01:57:17,211
I mean,

3723
01:57:17,211 --> 01:57:19,610
I could recognize and
he was wearing a thing.

3724
01:57:19,611 --> 01:57:20,510
I had no idea.

3725
01:57:20,511 --> 01:57:21,344
It was like,

3726
01:57:22,100 --> 01:57:23,840
I didn't know what the figures that,

3727
01:57:24,440 --> 01:57:29,120
but it was probably not as
you are probably need you
again to give me the proper

3728
01:57:29,121 --> 01:57:30,560
pronounciation thank you for,

3729
01:57:30,860 --> 01:57:32,120
but it was trust,

3730
01:57:32,330 --> 01:57:33,170
I think it was,

3731
01:57:33,350 --> 01:57:33,890
yeah.

3732
01:57:33,890 --> 01:57:34,723
Suck as gutsy.

3733
01:57:34,730 --> 01:57:35,450
Yeah.

3734
01:57:35,450 --> 01:57:35,661
Yeah.

3735
01:57:35,661 --> 01:57:36,494
It was leather.

3736
01:57:36,730 --> 01:57:39,350
Things like this and you know,

3737
01:57:39,410 --> 01:57:40,520
I was like,

3738
01:57:41,360 --> 01:57:43,820
I don't know what the
figures that you know could,

3739
01:57:44,210 --> 01:57:47,330
but I could see he was in pain and
he had this thing on and he got mad,

3740
01:57:48,920 --> 01:57:49,753
told me to get out.

3741
01:57:50,510 --> 01:57:51,343
And um,

3742
01:57:53,750 --> 01:57:56,420
for the rest of my young life
I knew there was some wall.

3743
01:57:56,780 --> 01:57:59,480
I knew he was in pain every
day and he never showed it.

3744
01:58:01,940 --> 01:58:03,290
He never uses juice.

3745
01:58:03,291 --> 01:58:04,160
He worked every day,

3746
01:58:04,161 --> 01:58:07,380
including Sunday has office hours,

3747
01:58:07,381 --> 01:58:09,830
word joke because if
it's said on the thing,

3748
01:58:10,130 --> 01:58:10,640
you know,

3749
01:58:10,640 --> 01:58:11,600
four 30,

3750
01:58:11,601 --> 01:58:15,410
he stayed till nine 30 because he
didn't leave till the last patient left.

3751
01:58:16,100 --> 01:58:17,390
And most of them Warren panel.

3752
01:58:18,620 --> 01:58:19,190
Okay.

3753
01:58:19,190 --> 01:58:20,023
You know,

3754
01:58:20,240 --> 01:58:20,490
he,

3755
01:58:20,490 --> 01:58:22,730
he took the patients that
other doctors didn't take,

3756
01:58:22,910 --> 01:58:24,140
took all the Medicare,

3757
01:58:24,170 --> 01:58:24,651
Medicaid,

3758
01:58:24,651 --> 01:58:27,890
whatever was whatever the
right one is basically welfare.

3759
01:58:28,250 --> 01:58:31,730
He took all of them and you know,

3760
01:58:32,300 --> 01:58:33,290
he made the,

3761
01:58:34,130 --> 01:58:35,960
he had the biggest practice on Stan arm,

3762
01:58:35,990 --> 01:58:37,310
maybe the biggest in New York.

3763
01:58:37,760 --> 01:58:38,593
So all the,

3764
01:58:38,660 --> 01:58:39,493
all the,

3765
01:58:40,400 --> 01:58:42,730
all the drug salesmen,

3766
01:58:44,150 --> 01:58:44,610
they,

3767
01:58:44,610 --> 01:58:46,750
they all migrated to his place.

3768
01:58:46,990 --> 01:58:48,160
You want to get his account

3769
01:58:50,050 --> 01:58:51,130
to sell the new stuff,

3770
01:58:51,131 --> 01:58:51,941
to sell the drugs,

3771
01:58:51,941 --> 01:58:52,810
to sell the pills.

3772
01:58:53,740 --> 01:58:56,170
And he used them.

3773
01:58:56,590 --> 01:58:57,610
He didn't hide it,

3774
01:58:58,810 --> 01:58:59,643
but he made them,

3775
01:59:00,400 --> 01:59:03,760
he made them give them
huge amount of samples.

3776
01:59:03,820 --> 01:59:04,653
You know why?

3777
01:59:05,050 --> 01:59:08,290
Because his patients couldn't
afford to fill the prescriptions.

3778
01:59:08,470 --> 01:59:10,300
So we would give him the free samples.

3779
01:59:12,470 --> 01:59:14,380
I used to always wonder
what the free call,

3780
01:59:14,381 --> 01:59:14,721
he said,

3781
01:59:14,721 --> 01:59:16,400
I know how to open up a closet.

3782
01:59:16,401 --> 01:59:17,990
There was like things falling on you,

3783
01:59:17,991 --> 01:59:18,560
you know,

3784
01:59:18,560 --> 01:59:21,490
like pills and stuff as
like what is hot and,

3785
01:59:21,950 --> 01:59:26,000
but it was so he could give it to
them so they didn't have to fill a

3786
01:59:26,001 --> 01:59:27,290
prescription because they didn't,

3787
01:59:27,320 --> 01:59:27,770
there was,

3788
01:59:27,770 --> 01:59:28,131
again,

3789
01:59:28,131 --> 01:59:31,490
there was none of those things that
pay for your prescriptions that they do

3790
01:59:31,491 --> 01:59:32,324
today.

3791
01:59:32,840 --> 01:59:33,890
And they couldn't afford it.

3792
01:59:34,190 --> 01:59:35,600
They couldn't afford to go to him,

3793
01:59:36,500 --> 01:59:38,720
but he charged them $3 $5,

3794
01:59:39,830 --> 01:59:40,460
whatever,

3795
01:59:40,460 --> 01:59:42,170
whatever it was that they could afford.

3796
01:59:43,520 --> 01:59:44,840
And you know,

3797
01:59:44,841 --> 01:59:45,680
he made money.

3798
01:59:45,980 --> 01:59:46,311
I mean,

3799
01:59:46,311 --> 01:59:47,210
he was a doctor,

3800
01:59:47,510 --> 01:59:49,760
but he didn't make the money
that other doctors will make it.

3801
01:59:50,720 --> 01:59:52,560
But he was a real doctor.

3802
01:59:53,020 --> 01:59:53,300
Right.

3803
01:59:53,300 --> 01:59:54,200
For me at least.

3804
01:59:54,710 --> 01:59:55,543
And,

3805
01:59:55,910 --> 01:59:57,080
but more importantly,

3806
01:59:58,310 --> 01:59:59,450
he didn't talk about it.

3807
01:59:59,451 --> 02:00:00,284
He did it.

3808
02:00:01,130 --> 02:00:01,963
And he,

3809
02:00:02,090 --> 02:00:03,440
every day he was in pain.

3810
02:00:03,860 --> 02:00:04,693
Later on,

3811
02:00:05,570 --> 02:00:06,381
I was a little older,

3812
02:00:06,381 --> 02:00:07,910
but I was still a young teenager.

3813
02:00:08,210 --> 02:00:10,070
I saw him put a white
pill onto his tongue.

3814
02:00:10,160 --> 02:00:11,540
I didn't know what the freak that was.

3815
02:00:11,930 --> 02:00:13,880
I later on I found out it was nitrile.

3816
02:00:14,660 --> 02:00:16,670
That is hardwoods put skipped beats.

3817
02:00:17,450 --> 02:00:19,790
But he still didn't say a word.

3818
02:00:20,150 --> 02:00:22,790
Didn't talk about it in all of,

3819
02:00:22,791 --> 02:00:24,950
he didn't have a son who
thought he was his hero.

3820
02:00:24,951 --> 02:00:25,784
He,

3821
02:00:26,080 --> 02:00:28,520
I wouldn't have known because
I looked at everything he did.

3822
02:00:30,050 --> 02:00:31,310
And you know,

3823
02:00:31,311 --> 02:00:31,611
he,

3824
02:00:31,611 --> 02:00:32,444
um,

3825
02:00:33,020 --> 02:00:34,280
he did house calls.

3826
02:00:35,330 --> 02:00:36,330
He did house calls,

3827
02:00:36,331 --> 02:00:37,520
who is 80 years old,

3828
02:00:38,240 --> 02:00:39,530
charging $5,

3829
02:00:39,830 --> 02:00:40,430
whatever.

3830
02:00:40,430 --> 02:00:41,263
Nothing.

3831
02:00:42,020 --> 02:00:44,850
He had patients that could
not get to an emergency room.

3832
02:00:45,320 --> 02:00:46,940
They didn't have the ability to get there.

3833
02:00:46,941 --> 02:00:47,900
They didn't have a car,

3834
02:00:48,500 --> 02:00:49,880
they wouldn't shape
where they couldn't get,

3835
02:00:49,881 --> 02:00:50,810
they couldn't take a bus,

3836
02:00:50,811 --> 02:00:51,644
whatever.

3837
02:00:51,950 --> 02:00:55,100
But so he did house calls
and a patient when he died,

3838
02:00:55,101 --> 02:00:55,934
they all said,

3839
02:00:56,030 --> 02:00:56,541
hey Lou,

3840
02:00:56,541 --> 02:00:58,640
you sometimes you had to
wait to one in the morning.

3841
02:00:58,641 --> 02:00:59,540
But he got there.

3842
02:01:00,950 --> 02:01:01,641
That was the thing.

3843
02:01:01,641 --> 02:01:02,540
He always got there.

3844
02:01:03,440 --> 02:01:04,310
He always delivered.

3845
02:01:05,660 --> 02:01:07,880
And with all those things that I knew was,

3846
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:08,271
you know,

3847
02:01:08,271 --> 02:01:08,391
his,

3848
02:01:08,391 --> 02:01:09,224
his kid,

3849
02:01:10,520 --> 02:01:11,510
he never used it,

3850
02:01:11,511 --> 02:01:12,500
made an excuse.

3851
02:01:14,130 --> 02:01:15,740
And he was a fighter.

3852
02:01:17,620 --> 02:01:18,420
Yeah.

3853
02:01:18,420 --> 02:01:18,751
You know,

3854
02:01:18,751 --> 02:01:18,931
in,

3855
02:01:18,931 --> 02:01:19,770
in their own way.

3856
02:01:19,771 --> 02:01:20,604
He was to,

3857
02:01:20,970 --> 02:01:21,803
you know,

3858
02:01:22,230 --> 02:01:26,130
he was the best fighter of his
sore and he didn't talk about it.

3859
02:01:26,131 --> 02:01:27,330
He didn't articulate it,

3860
02:01:28,170 --> 02:01:28,591
you know,

3861
02:01:28,591 --> 02:01:30,330
he didn't wax poetic about it,

3862
02:01:30,420 --> 02:01:32,250
like cause state and
cause was a great man,

3863
02:01:33,720 --> 02:01:34,553
but he did it.

3864
02:01:35,160 --> 02:01:36,630
He did right in front of my face.

3865
02:01:37,850 --> 02:01:38,290
Okay.

3866
02:01:38,290 --> 02:01:38,720
And,

3867
02:01:38,720 --> 02:01:39,553
uh,

3868
02:01:42,180 --> 02:01:43,170
and it stayed with me.

3869
02:01:44,530 --> 02:01:44,800
You know,

3870
02:01:44,800 --> 02:01:46,180
I didn't understand a lot of it too.

3871
02:01:46,181 --> 02:01:47,014
I got Olga,

3872
02:01:48,600 --> 02:01:51,050
but then suddenly I understood all of it.

3873
02:01:52,650 --> 02:01:53,310
Okay.

3874
02:01:53,310 --> 02:01:53,551
And,

3875
02:01:53,551 --> 02:01:54,384
um,

3876
02:01:54,810 --> 02:01:56,460
so if somebody says,

3877
02:01:56,461 --> 02:01:57,294
hey,

3878
02:01:58,680 --> 02:01:59,071
you know,

3879
02:01:59,071 --> 02:02:00,780
I can't do this because you know,

3880
02:02:01,290 --> 02:02:02,580
last night my girlfriend,

3881
02:02:02,581 --> 02:02:05,580
my wife yelled at me and she
caught me with a girl and she did.

3882
02:02:05,970 --> 02:02:06,331
I mean,

3883
02:02:06,331 --> 02:02:07,164
I don't want to hear it.

3884
02:02:10,080 --> 02:02:10,913
I don't want to eat,

3885
02:02:12,090 --> 02:02:12,990
I don't want to hear it

3886
02:02:14,640 --> 02:02:15,121
and listen,

3887
02:02:15,121 --> 02:02:16,170
it was of course to me too,

3888
02:02:16,171 --> 02:02:19,080
in some ways it's not perfect
because when my father died,

3889
02:02:19,410 --> 02:02:20,131
I went to the,

3890
02:02:20,131 --> 02:02:24,070
I went to the funeral and then I went
to the gym and I didn't tell nobody.

3891
02:02:24,570 --> 02:02:25,021
And listen,

3892
02:02:25,021 --> 02:02:25,854
I probably shouldn't.

3893
02:02:27,300 --> 02:02:31,080
A lot of people would probably say he
can't live your life to weight by what

3894
02:02:31,081 --> 02:02:31,561
people say.

3895
02:02:31,561 --> 02:02:32,394
I get it.

3896
02:02:32,400 --> 02:02:34,050
But I'm just saying I'm aware of it.

3897
02:02:34,051 --> 02:02:34,850
All right?

3898
02:02:34,850 --> 02:02:36,720
A lot of people who say you
shouldn't have went to the gym.

3899
02:02:39,310 --> 02:02:40,180
My father,

3900
02:02:40,270 --> 02:02:41,140
we lost a kid.

3901
02:02:41,141 --> 02:02:42,130
He just five years old,

3902
02:02:42,910 --> 02:02:45,950
and I wasn't going to say this because
I don't know how some people say it,

3903
02:02:45,951 --> 02:02:47,230
but if it is,

3904
02:02:47,231 --> 02:02:47,621
it is.

3905
02:02:47,621 --> 02:02:48,454
Right.

3906
02:02:48,790 --> 02:02:50,830
So you could take it the
way you want to take it.

3907
02:02:51,550 --> 02:02:53,200
I know the kind of man he was.

3908
02:02:53,890 --> 02:02:54,723
But

3909
02:02:55,780 --> 02:02:59,110
you talked about commitment absolute
as you talked about certain things,

3910
02:02:59,111 --> 02:02:59,944
right.

3911
02:03:00,370 --> 02:03:02,530
Maybe this explains some of it.

3912
02:03:03,070 --> 02:03:04,030
We had little Todd,

3913
02:03:04,031 --> 02:03:04,864
he was all proud of,

3914
02:03:05,420 --> 02:03:07,360
he was born with foot problems.

3915
02:03:07,390 --> 02:03:08,223
Who's retarded?

3916
02:03:08,410 --> 02:03:09,850
You don't use that word anymore.

3917
02:03:09,851 --> 02:03:11,890
But in those days it was
okay to use that word.

3918
02:03:11,891 --> 02:03:12,640
That's what he was.

3919
02:03:12,640 --> 02:03:13,473
Okay.

3920
02:03:13,480 --> 02:03:15,550
Now of course you say
that it was impaired,

3921
02:03:15,910 --> 02:03:16,900
mentally impaired,

3922
02:03:17,050 --> 02:03:17,883
whatever.

3923
02:03:17,920 --> 02:03:18,490
Okay,

3924
02:03:18,490 --> 02:03:19,450
so beautiful kid.

3925
02:03:19,480 --> 02:03:20,313
I remember

3926
02:03:22,240 --> 02:03:23,050
I was older,

3927
02:03:23,050 --> 02:03:23,883
I was the oldest.

3928
02:03:24,790 --> 02:03:25,690
He was very loving.

3929
02:03:26,500 --> 02:03:28,930
I remember used to jump into
my arms when I come home,

3930
02:03:28,931 --> 02:03:33,340
so I know he was very trusting because
I would walk up the steps and it would

3931
02:03:33,341 --> 02:03:35,200
jump from the steps if
I didn't catch them,

3932
02:03:35,290 --> 02:03:36,460
obviously would have fell.

3933
02:03:36,670 --> 02:03:38,080
So it was part of his condition,

3934
02:03:38,081 --> 02:03:40,960
but it was part of his
lovingness and has his trust.

3935
02:03:43,500 --> 02:03:44,730
So when he was five years old,

3936
02:03:44,731 --> 02:03:45,690
he had to get surgery.

3937
02:03:45,691 --> 02:03:46,370
He had a problem,

3938
02:03:46,370 --> 02:03:47,010
was hot,

3939
02:03:47,010 --> 02:03:47,630
it was open house,

3940
02:03:47,630 --> 02:03:47,731
her,

3941
02:03:47,731 --> 02:03:47,881
hers.

3942
02:03:47,881 --> 02:03:48,400
We opened ours.

3943
02:03:48,400 --> 02:03:48,991
Heard who's old?

3944
02:03:48,991 --> 02:03:51,060
Different story back then.

3945
02:03:51,061 --> 02:03:51,894
Right.

3946
02:03:51,990 --> 02:03:53,580
And where did he get out of probation?

3947
02:03:53,581 --> 02:03:53,761
Yeah,

3948
02:03:53,761 --> 02:03:54,240
he did.

3949
02:03:54,240 --> 02:03:55,380
And my father's hospital,

3950
02:03:55,800 --> 02:03:57,450
my father did not perform the surgery,

3951
02:03:57,451 --> 02:03:57,931
of course,

3952
02:03:57,931 --> 02:03:59,550
that you're not going to do that.

3953
02:03:59,850 --> 02:04:00,683
But it was there.

3954
02:04:01,200 --> 02:04:01,581
So it was this,

3955
02:04:01,581 --> 02:04:03,330
a few sergeants might've been five,

3956
02:04:03,331 --> 02:04:04,164
whatever it was.

3957
02:04:07,260 --> 02:04:08,093
And um,

3958
02:04:10,250 --> 02:04:11,083
okay.

3959
02:04:11,400 --> 02:04:12,640
My mother was the opposite.

3960
02:04:12,641 --> 02:04:12,840
I have,

3961
02:04:12,840 --> 02:04:15,240
my father was a Hungarian
Jewish background,

3962
02:04:15,600 --> 02:04:16,150
you know,

3963
02:04:16,150 --> 02:04:16,520
uh,

3964
02:04:16,520 --> 02:04:16,700
he,

3965
02:04:16,700 --> 02:04:17,610
he had no father.

3966
02:04:17,611 --> 02:04:18,450
He died young.

3967
02:04:18,750 --> 02:04:19,261
His mother,

3968
02:04:19,261 --> 02:04:20,220
they were very poor.

3969
02:04:20,700 --> 02:04:21,960
My mother grew up poor too.

3970
02:04:21,961 --> 02:04:22,230
Shoes,

3971
02:04:22,230 --> 02:04:22,920
Irish,

3972
02:04:22,920 --> 02:04:23,910
Irish Catholic,

3973
02:04:25,200 --> 02:04:26,040
different lakes.

3974
02:04:26,430 --> 02:04:28,680
And my father didn't
have time for religion.

3975
02:04:28,710 --> 02:04:32,970
My time for that time for
living and for healing people.

3976
02:04:33,660 --> 02:04:35,760
So he let us be brought up Catholic.

3977
02:04:35,830 --> 02:04:36,810
That was up to my mother.

3978
02:04:38,310 --> 02:04:38,671
And,

3979
02:04:38,671 --> 02:04:39,504
uh,

3980
02:04:40,710 --> 02:04:41,543
so he,

3981
02:04:42,760 --> 02:04:43,530
yeah,

3982
02:04:43,530 --> 02:04:44,281
they were different.

3983
02:04:44,281 --> 02:04:45,570
They would the opposites.

3984
02:04:45,720 --> 02:04:46,710
When mother was beautiful,

3985
02:04:46,711 --> 02:04:47,890
she was Miss Staten Island.

3986
02:04:48,820 --> 02:04:50,880
A Mother didn't let her father died.

3987
02:04:51,300 --> 02:04:52,200
Also young,

3988
02:04:52,970 --> 02:04:53,803
uh,

3989
02:04:53,880 --> 02:04:57,890
her mother was a tough
Irish woman and she,

3990
02:04:58,000 --> 02:04:58,730
my grandma,

3991
02:04:58,730 --> 02:04:59,120
she,

3992
02:04:59,120 --> 02:05:02,390
she did not allow her
from winning Ms. Dot.

3993
02:05:02,391 --> 02:05:03,570
[inaudible] she was
supposed to go to them,

3994
02:05:03,960 --> 02:05:05,220
obviously to Miss America.

3995
02:05:05,490 --> 02:05:06,330
She wouldn't let it go.

3996
02:05:06,570 --> 02:05:06,870
Look,

3997
02:05:06,870 --> 02:05:08,820
I'd say right out she
thought that was for horse.

3998
02:05:09,540 --> 02:05:09,751
Like,

3999
02:05:09,751 --> 02:05:10,590
like you go do that.

4000
02:05:10,620 --> 02:05:10,891
You know,

4001
02:05:10,891 --> 02:05:11,701
even though she wanted,

4002
02:05:11,701 --> 02:05:12,031
she led,

4003
02:05:12,031 --> 02:05:12,864
that was cute,

4004
02:05:13,050 --> 02:05:14,520
but now you're going to go miss America.

4005
02:05:14,521 --> 02:05:15,000
You're going to go,

4006
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:16,080
no we're not.

4007
02:05:16,590 --> 02:05:17,011
She said,

4008
02:05:17,011 --> 02:05:17,131
no,

4009
02:05:17,131 --> 02:05:17,964
you're not doing it.

4010
02:05:18,210 --> 02:05:21,120
And she had a chance to go
and try out for the rock cats,

4011
02:05:21,121 --> 02:05:22,370
which most people are.

4012
02:05:22,390 --> 02:05:23,340
They know what they are.

4013
02:05:23,700 --> 02:05:27,210
The dance group in Radio
City Music Hall now.

4014
02:05:27,280 --> 02:05:29,310
That's for those people told them no.

4015
02:05:30,360 --> 02:05:35,360
So she was beautiful and she had
a great personality and she's,

4016
02:05:35,820 --> 02:05:37,560
she love social life.

4017
02:05:38,310 --> 02:05:43,310
And two is the antithesis of my father
and a lot of ways and I guess opposites

4018
02:05:44,671 --> 02:05:47,370
attract and if you want
to make a movie out of it,

4019
02:05:47,760 --> 02:05:48,660
she was sick

4020
02:05:50,590 --> 02:05:51,423
and he,

4021
02:05:52,650 --> 02:05:53,670
she wasn't getting better.

4022
02:05:54,090 --> 02:05:55,890
And my father was in the hospital,

4023
02:05:56,640 --> 02:05:57,510
he was in,

4024
02:05:57,540 --> 02:05:59,700
I guess his patient was in the tool room,

4025
02:06:00,150 --> 02:06:00,721
whatever,

4026
02:06:00,721 --> 02:06:01,260
whatever.

4027
02:06:01,260 --> 02:06:05,460
Then he became a doctor
and a help to get better.

4028
02:06:06,990 --> 02:06:08,430
She had a form of hepatitis,

4029
02:06:09,180 --> 02:06:10,013
um,

4030
02:06:10,080 --> 02:06:14,010
back in the days when you didn't get it
from needles only he could get it from

4031
02:06:14,011 --> 02:06:15,420
eating a bad clam,

4032
02:06:16,530 --> 02:06:17,363
whatever.

4033
02:06:17,700 --> 02:06:19,830
I don't know if it was c whatever it is,

4034
02:06:20,280 --> 02:06:22,380
I'm not going to tell you
because I don't know for sure,

4035
02:06:22,381 --> 02:06:23,214
but,

4036
02:06:23,460 --> 02:06:27,330
and she was very sick and anyway,

4037
02:06:27,331 --> 02:06:27,780
he,

4038
02:06:27,780 --> 02:06:30,060
he took care of her and they got married.

4039
02:06:30,600 --> 02:06:32,880
They fell in love and
in all of that stuff.

4040
02:06:34,650 --> 02:06:35,483
So,

4041
02:06:36,090 --> 02:06:36,923
you know,

4042
02:06:38,310 --> 02:06:38,731
just,

4043
02:06:38,731 --> 02:06:39,564
um,

4044
02:06:40,260 --> 02:06:41,490
my father was a,

4045
02:06:43,630 --> 02:06:44,141
like I said,

4046
02:06:44,141 --> 02:06:45,070
my father was,

4047
02:06:45,840 --> 02:06:46,673
he,

4048
02:06:47,440 --> 02:06:48,640
he was dedicated to,

4049
02:06:48,641 --> 02:06:49,474
uh,

4050
02:06:49,540 --> 02:06:50,373
to that life.

4051
02:06:50,920 --> 02:06:51,753
Uh,

4052
02:06:51,910 --> 02:06:54,220
but the thing that he did
that I started to say,

4053
02:06:55,390 --> 02:06:56,830
and I don't want to give that background,

4054
02:06:56,831 --> 02:06:57,131
I guess,

4055
02:06:57,131 --> 02:06:57,964
but

4056
02:07:00,700 --> 02:07:01,160
my,

4057
02:07:01,160 --> 02:07:01,910
my,

4058
02:07:01,910 --> 02:07:03,620
my mother was very emotional.

4059
02:07:03,800 --> 02:07:04,820
My father's a doctor.

4060
02:07:04,821 --> 02:07:05,990
He hid his emotions.

4061
02:07:07,100 --> 02:07:07,530
Okay.

4062
02:07:07,530 --> 02:07:09,570
And when Todd one for surgery,

4063
02:07:09,571 --> 02:07:11,070
he died on the operating table.

4064
02:07:12,210 --> 02:07:13,380
He had told my mother,

4065
02:07:13,950 --> 02:07:15,120
my father never lied.

4066
02:07:16,460 --> 02:07:16,880
Okay.

4067
02:07:16,880 --> 02:07:18,080
He told her the risk,

4068
02:07:18,500 --> 02:07:20,750
but my mother want to believe
what you want to believe.

4069
02:07:21,050 --> 02:07:21,771
My mother said,

4070
02:07:21,771 --> 02:07:23,150
you said it would be okay.

4071
02:07:25,700 --> 02:07:26,010
No,

4072
02:07:26,010 --> 02:07:26,821
he didn't say that,

4073
02:07:26,821 --> 02:07:27,150
but,

4074
02:07:27,150 --> 02:07:27,983
you know,

4075
02:07:28,610 --> 02:07:29,940
but of course my mother,

4076
02:07:30,120 --> 02:07:31,620
my father was high level to,

4077
02:07:33,510 --> 02:07:34,343
you know,

4078
02:07:34,770 --> 02:07:35,603
made her better.

4079
02:07:35,680 --> 02:07:36,880
I can't make you sound better.

4080
02:07:38,170 --> 02:07:39,130
So he died.

4081
02:07:40,090 --> 02:07:41,200
We all got split up.

4082
02:07:43,090 --> 02:07:46,810
I had to live with an uncle that was
single and it was a very handsome guy,

4083
02:07:46,840 --> 02:07:47,673
just like want.

4084
02:07:48,040 --> 02:07:51,640
So he had girlfriend coming in
and out all the time and you know,

4085
02:07:51,641 --> 02:07:51,921
he was,

4086
02:07:51,921 --> 02:07:52,200
uh,

4087
02:07:52,200 --> 02:07:52,840
and you know,

4088
02:07:52,840 --> 02:07:53,673
he was a young,

4089
02:07:54,580 --> 02:07:57,910
good looking guy and liked to go out.

4090
02:07:58,320 --> 02:08:00,490
I'd wind up sitting in
a bar waiting for them.

4091
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:02,740
I get a lot of bags of potato chips,

4092
02:08:04,210 --> 02:08:05,200
a lot of cokes,

4093
02:08:05,980 --> 02:08:06,371
you know,

4094
02:08:06,371 --> 02:08:07,540
he could finally come back.

4095
02:08:07,541 --> 02:08:08,800
I have eight cooks in front of me,

4096
02:08:10,180 --> 02:08:11,013
maybe 10,

4097
02:08:12,930 --> 02:08:13,540
you know.

4098
02:08:13,540 --> 02:08:13,811
And,

4099
02:08:13,811 --> 02:08:14,470
um,

4100
02:08:14,470 --> 02:08:15,281
we got split up from,

4101
02:08:15,281 --> 02:08:17,140
my mother was sleeping in a cemetery.

4102
02:08:18,250 --> 02:08:19,210
She had a nervous breakdown,

4103
02:08:20,260 --> 02:08:21,340
but you know,

4104
02:08:21,341 --> 02:08:22,360
she got herself together.

4105
02:08:22,361 --> 02:08:23,290
She overcame it.

4106
02:08:24,460 --> 02:08:24,761
But,

4107
02:08:24,761 --> 02:08:25,594
um,

4108
02:08:28,420 --> 02:08:29,590
she never forgave him.

4109
02:08:31,360 --> 02:08:32,110
Yeah.

4110
02:08:32,110 --> 02:08:32,650
You know,

4111
02:08:32,650 --> 02:08:32,891
and,

4112
02:08:32,891 --> 02:08:33,724
um,

4113
02:08:34,990 --> 02:08:35,231
you know,

4114
02:08:35,231 --> 02:08:38,470
she was Irish and then the easy thing
is to Irish curse and all that stuff,

4115
02:08:38,471 --> 02:08:39,101
but you know,

4116
02:08:39,101 --> 02:08:39,934
she drank.

4117
02:08:41,890 --> 02:08:42,131
But,

4118
02:08:42,131 --> 02:08:42,964
um,

4119
02:08:45,240 --> 02:08:45,721
she,

4120
02:08:45,721 --> 02:08:46,554
uh,

4121
02:08:47,340 --> 02:08:48,180
she's a great woman,

4122
02:08:48,660 --> 02:08:53,660
but she was tragically hurt and you know,

4123
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,220
everyone copes with things
differently and she,

4124
02:08:56,250 --> 02:08:57,083
uh,

4125
02:08:57,630 --> 02:08:58,170
it was,

4126
02:08:58,170 --> 02:08:59,003
it was difficult.

4127
02:08:59,220 --> 02:09:01,290
And that day with all of the,

4128
02:09:01,310 --> 02:09:02,520
what I just described,

4129
02:09:02,521 --> 02:09:02,971
and again,

4130
02:09:02,971 --> 02:09:04,140
I'm always afraid to say it,

4131
02:09:04,500 --> 02:09:07,020
but you say it because it's part of it,

4132
02:09:07,050 --> 02:09:07,883
right?

4133
02:09:08,340 --> 02:09:09,240
Maybe it explains,

4134
02:09:09,241 --> 02:09:09,690
maybe,

4135
02:09:09,690 --> 02:09:11,970
maybe some people hold it
against him when I say this,

4136
02:09:13,080 --> 02:09:17,810
but he got a phone call that
day on his answer and surface.

4137
02:09:17,820 --> 02:09:19,530
And you didn't have pages in those days.

4138
02:09:19,830 --> 02:09:21,120
He had an answer and surface.

4139
02:09:21,480 --> 02:09:26,310
He told them to call him when
he had requests for house calls.

4140
02:09:26,610 --> 02:09:28,530
Two in the morning as a kid,

4141
02:09:28,800 --> 02:09:30,270
I used to hear the phone ring.

4142
02:09:30,420 --> 02:09:31,440
It was tuna morning.

4143
02:09:31,760 --> 02:09:33,300
I started getting dressed.

4144
02:09:33,301 --> 02:09:35,680
I came out and I was on the
stairs waiting for the golf.

4145
02:09:36,980 --> 02:09:37,920
He looked at me,

4146
02:09:37,921 --> 02:09:38,611
what were you doing?

4147
02:09:38,611 --> 02:09:39,040
I'm going,

4148
02:09:39,040 --> 02:09:39,970
which now,

4149
02:09:40,200 --> 02:09:40,650
you know,

4150
02:09:40,650 --> 02:09:41,550
get back in the mall.

4151
02:09:42,990 --> 02:09:43,770
You know,

4152
02:09:43,770 --> 02:09:45,000
sometimes you let me go with them.

4153
02:09:46,290 --> 02:09:46,621
And,

4154
02:09:46,621 --> 02:09:47,454
um,

4155
02:09:48,660 --> 02:09:48,991
anyway,

4156
02:09:48,991 --> 02:09:49,471
this day,

4157
02:09:49,471 --> 02:09:53,350
obviously it was a different
day and there was a,

4158
02:09:53,550 --> 02:09:58,380
his patient has patient's
daughter had a child who was very,

4159
02:09:58,381 --> 02:09:59,310
very sick.

4160
02:10:00,990 --> 02:10:02,730
She did not know that has some,

4161
02:10:03,030 --> 02:10:03,611
the mother,

4162
02:10:03,611 --> 02:10:03,841
no,

4163
02:10:03,841 --> 02:10:06,570
but the daughter didn't know
that his son died that day.

4164
02:10:06,630 --> 02:10:08,130
That his son was buried that day,

4165
02:10:08,131 --> 02:10:08,964
I should say.

4166
02:10:11,430 --> 02:10:12,263
So she called,

4167
02:10:13,560 --> 02:10:17,070
he went and did a house
call on a day that is,

4168
02:10:17,430 --> 02:10:18,263
you know,

4169
02:10:20,450 --> 02:10:21,560
that his son got Barry.

4170
02:10:23,250 --> 02:10:23,540
You know,

4171
02:10:23,540 --> 02:10:24,373
that's tough.

4172
02:10:25,190 --> 02:10:26,023
But that was what,

4173
02:10:26,030 --> 02:10:26,301
you know,

4174
02:10:26,301 --> 02:10:27,320
that's what his,

4175
02:10:27,330 --> 02:10:27,620
you know,

4176
02:10:27,620 --> 02:10:28,281
that's what his,

4177
02:10:28,281 --> 02:10:29,114
um,

4178
02:10:29,450 --> 02:10:32,960
so when people tell me that
they can't keep a commitment,

4179
02:10:33,320 --> 02:10:34,153
this happened,

4180
02:10:35,150 --> 02:10:36,410
it doesn't go with me.

4181
02:10:37,100 --> 02:10:37,933
That's all.

4182
02:10:38,390 --> 02:10:40,250
And that day after I buried my father,

4183
02:10:40,251 --> 02:10:41,180
I went to the gym

4184
02:10:42,680 --> 02:10:43,970
and I trained Michael Moore

4185
02:10:46,470 --> 02:10:47,301
because I was,

4186
02:10:47,301 --> 02:10:47,541
you know,

4187
02:10:47,541 --> 02:10:48,560
that's what I was doing.

4188
02:10:48,680 --> 02:10:49,513
That was my job,

4189
02:10:53,860 --> 02:10:54,693
character,

4190
02:10:56,050 --> 02:10:56,883
real character.

4191
02:10:57,630 --> 02:10:57,911
I mean,

4192
02:10:57,911 --> 02:10:58,631
whatever it is,

4193
02:10:58,631 --> 02:10:59,051
it is.

4194
02:10:59,051 --> 02:11:00,040
But whatever it is,

4195
02:11:00,041 --> 02:11:00,530
that's trend,

4196
02:11:00,530 --> 02:11:00,850
you know,

4197
02:11:00,850 --> 02:11:02,710
call it whatever name,

4198
02:11:02,711 --> 02:11:03,880
whatever noise you want to make.

4199
02:11:05,260 --> 02:11:06,550
There's not a lot of people like that.

4200
02:11:07,120 --> 02:11:08,110
That explains a lot,

4201
02:11:10,660 --> 02:11:14,440
explains a lot about your on yielding,

4202
02:11:16,360 --> 02:11:19,300
understanding and appreciation
of real commitment.

4203
02:11:22,780 --> 02:11:23,111
Yeah.

4204
02:11:23,111 --> 02:11:23,530
I mean,

4205
02:11:23,530 --> 02:11:24,363
I mean that's,

4206
02:11:24,370 --> 02:11:24,790
that's,

4207
02:11:24,790 --> 02:11:25,001
yeah,

4208
02:11:25,001 --> 02:11:25,834
that's,

4209
02:11:27,010 --> 02:11:27,500
and it's,

4210
02:11:27,500 --> 02:11:28,720
we almost don't have a choice,

4211
02:11:28,721 --> 02:11:28,990
you know,

4212
02:11:28,990 --> 02:11:31,510
because to not

4213
02:11:33,130 --> 02:11:33,440
listen,

4214
02:11:33,440 --> 02:11:34,273
you just do it.

4215
02:11:34,570 --> 02:11:35,890
But to not follow that,

4216
02:11:40,170 --> 02:11:41,390
in some ways it's,

4217
02:11:41,950 --> 02:11:44,400
it's like you're not honoring your father

4218
02:11:46,050 --> 02:11:48,020
because your father's leave.

4219
02:11:48,030 --> 02:11:49,080
Just certain things,

4220
02:11:49,380 --> 02:11:49,621
you know,

4221
02:11:49,621 --> 02:11:50,454
they leave you,

4222
02:11:50,490 --> 02:11:51,060
you know,

4223
02:11:51,060 --> 02:11:51,571
something in the,

4224
02:11:51,571 --> 02:11:54,690
well maybe they'd leave your whatever.

4225
02:11:54,720 --> 02:11:59,120
They might leave your special trinket
of something that he always remember a

4226
02:11:59,121 --> 02:11:59,611
car,

4227
02:11:59,611 --> 02:12:00,444
a little thing,

4228
02:12:00,450 --> 02:12:01,283
whatever,

4229
02:12:01,890 --> 02:12:03,840
but they leave you something.

4230
02:12:04,380 --> 02:12:06,210
If you're fortunate
enough to have a father.

4231
02:12:07,640 --> 02:12:08,730
I know not everyone is,

4232
02:12:08,731 --> 02:12:09,564
I get it.

4233
02:12:10,080 --> 02:12:13,980
But when they leave you that you,

4234
02:12:15,180 --> 02:12:16,013
you got to,

4235
02:12:18,420 --> 02:12:19,260
you got to cherish it.

4236
02:12:21,420 --> 02:12:22,253
You should.

4237
02:12:22,680 --> 02:12:23,790
And that's what he left me.

4238
02:12:24,240 --> 02:12:26,280
So to be,

4239
02:12:26,880 --> 02:12:31,880
it's not that I'm a good guy or bad
guy or great guy or less or anything.

4240
02:12:31,891 --> 02:12:32,460
I'm not,

4241
02:12:32,460 --> 02:12:33,330
I'm not any of that.

4242
02:12:33,570 --> 02:12:37,230
But I'm loyal to that because

4243
02:12:39,180 --> 02:12:40,380
you should be loyal to that,

4244
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:41,940
if that makes sense.

4245
02:12:41,970 --> 02:12:42,803
I mean,

4246
02:12:43,290 --> 02:12:44,040
you know,

4247
02:12:44,040 --> 02:12:45,630
I'm loyal to that idea.

4248
02:12:45,631 --> 02:12:46,890
I'm loyal to that living.

4249
02:12:46,891 --> 02:12:47,850
I'm a loyal to that,

4250
02:12:48,650 --> 02:12:49,483
that

4251
02:12:53,660 --> 02:12:56,840
[inaudible] stance that he
took and living his life,

4252
02:12:58,190 --> 02:12:59,810
that belief that,

4253
02:13:00,170 --> 02:13:01,003
you know,

4254
02:13:03,230 --> 02:13:04,490
principle of living,

4255
02:13:04,491 --> 02:13:06,590
whatever you want to call
code of whatever you were,

4256
02:13:07,250 --> 02:13:08,420
all those words that make it,

4257
02:13:08,630 --> 02:13:09,050
you know,

4258
02:13:09,050 --> 02:13:09,883
sound better.

4259
02:13:10,160 --> 02:13:10,993
But

4260
02:13:13,610 --> 02:13:15,090
I would feel that I,

4261
02:13:16,280 --> 02:13:18,080
by not doing it that way,

4262
02:13:19,010 --> 02:13:22,940
when you're lucky enough to have a man
that kind of taught you what he taught

4263
02:13:22,941 --> 02:13:24,350
you without talking too much.

4264
02:13:25,130 --> 02:13:25,521
Um,

4265
02:13:25,521 --> 02:13:29,110
and that might be the greatest
teacher is by seeing right

4266
02:13:30,620 --> 02:13:31,560
examples of it.

4267
02:13:32,760 --> 02:13:34,230
But if you don't honor that,

4268
02:13:36,480 --> 02:13:37,920
then you're not honoring your father

4269
02:13:40,200 --> 02:13:41,160
what he stood for.

4270
02:13:41,400 --> 02:13:43,470
And at the end of the
day I was pissed because

4271
02:13:46,380 --> 02:13:47,730
for everything that he did,

4272
02:13:48,360 --> 02:13:49,050
there's nothing,

4273
02:13:49,050 --> 02:13:49,883
there's no,

4274
02:13:50,070 --> 02:13:52,710
I know that sounds foolish,

4275
02:13:52,711 --> 02:13:54,240
but there's no statue of him.

4276
02:13:55,980 --> 02:13:57,090
And so

4277
02:13:58,770 --> 02:13:59,730
for me,

4278
02:14:00,720 --> 02:14:04,560
there should be something
because he did it his whole life.

4279
02:14:05,250 --> 02:14:05,521
You know,

4280
02:14:05,521 --> 02:14:07,410
we all have moments of,

4281
02:14:07,860 --> 02:14:08,693
uh,

4282
02:14:10,080 --> 02:14:10,913
of light,

4283
02:14:10,940 --> 02:14:11,940
of moments of

4284
02:14:13,740 --> 02:14:15,570
where we maybe worry about what's,

4285
02:14:15,630 --> 02:14:16,201
what's there,

4286
02:14:16,201 --> 02:14:18,030
when we're gone and where we're going.

4287
02:14:18,030 --> 02:14:19,560
And maybe we change and I've seen it,

4288
02:14:19,561 --> 02:14:20,430
I've seen it with friends.

4289
02:14:20,431 --> 02:14:20,881
I get it,

4290
02:14:20,881 --> 02:14:21,571
I understand that.

4291
02:14:21,571 --> 02:14:25,700
But where we start trying to
live differently because we,

4292
02:14:25,830 --> 02:14:28,470
we start wondering about
what's coming next,

4293
02:14:28,530 --> 02:14:30,630
when we're gone death,

4294
02:14:30,631 --> 02:14:30,961
whatever,

4295
02:14:30,961 --> 02:14:31,381
you know,

4296
02:14:31,381 --> 02:14:32,760
but what's there.

4297
02:14:33,180 --> 02:14:35,190
And so we start thinking
about that a little bit.

4298
02:14:35,191 --> 02:14:37,200
Maybe I've seen people influenced by that.

4299
02:14:37,201 --> 02:14:38,034
I have,

4300
02:14:38,220 --> 02:14:38,821
you have to,

4301
02:14:38,821 --> 02:14:39,654
I'm sure.

4302
02:14:40,350 --> 02:14:43,500
And he was not influenced by that.

4303
02:14:44,270 --> 02:14:46,050
It was just what he was.

4304
02:14:47,340 --> 02:14:48,750
He was that his whole life.

4305
02:14:50,340 --> 02:14:54,960
And the only thing that I can think,

4306
02:14:55,680 --> 02:14:58,590
because I try to put pieces
together a little bit of what he,

4307
02:14:58,680 --> 02:15:01,470
how he got that way and

4308
02:15:03,540 --> 02:15:05,580
all I know from people when he died,

4309
02:15:05,581 --> 02:15:05,821
you know,

4310
02:15:05,821 --> 02:15:06,810
patients come up to you,

4311
02:15:06,811 --> 02:15:08,250
they're great and they
want to tell you something,

4312
02:15:08,251 --> 02:15:09,084
you know,

4313
02:15:09,390 --> 02:15:11,580
and they,

4314
02:15:11,850 --> 02:15:12,690
they told me,

4315
02:15:13,710 --> 02:15:14,460
you know,

4316
02:15:14,460 --> 02:15:17,430
that they were pouring on the
neighborhood and everything.

4317
02:15:17,480 --> 02:15:22,020
A neighborhood called Mirin is Harper
down by the water in stat now and rough

4318
02:15:22,021 --> 02:15:22,411
place,

4319
02:15:22,411 --> 02:15:23,244
you know.

4320
02:15:23,790 --> 02:15:24,623
And um,

4321
02:15:27,540 --> 02:15:29,910
they told me that his
mother was a tough woman.

4322
02:15:31,050 --> 02:15:35,400
She didn't have a tough woman
and they was three sons.

4323
02:15:35,700 --> 02:15:38,100
You know when they were
originally from day one born,

4324
02:15:38,101 --> 02:15:39,400
they were born here but she,

4325
02:15:39,470 --> 02:15:40,303
they were from,

4326
02:15:40,530 --> 02:15:41,280
from Europe,

4327
02:15:41,280 --> 02:15:41,820
you know,

4328
02:15:41,820 --> 02:15:42,653
and they had,

4329
02:15:42,930 --> 02:15:43,763
uh,

4330
02:15:43,920 --> 02:15:45,530
you had to be with the modded.

4331
02:15:45,720 --> 02:15:47,250
The mother told them what they had to be.

4332
02:15:48,660 --> 02:15:50,370
She told each one what you're going to be.

4333
02:15:50,790 --> 02:15:52,050
The oldest was my father.

4334
02:15:52,051 --> 02:15:55,980
Like I was the oldest and Eugene,

4335
02:15:56,190 --> 02:15:57,780
you're going to be an orthodontist.

4336
02:15:57,900 --> 02:15:59,100
He became an orthodontist.

4337
02:15:59,101 --> 02:16:01,610
Very successful Grad.

4338
02:16:01,750 --> 02:16:01,871
Old.

4339
02:16:01,871 --> 02:16:02,910
You're going to be an engineer.

4340
02:16:03,090 --> 02:16:04,110
Boeing aircraft,

4341
02:16:04,530 --> 02:16:05,820
unbelievably successful.

4342
02:16:05,821 --> 02:16:06,660
Lived in Seattle.

4343
02:16:07,620 --> 02:16:08,453
Theodore,

4344
02:16:08,750 --> 02:16:09,271
the oldest,

4345
02:16:09,271 --> 02:16:10,860
her favorite and all.

4346
02:16:10,861 --> 02:16:12,000
You're not supposed to have a favorite,

4347
02:16:12,001 --> 02:16:13,260
but it's real.

4348
02:16:13,261 --> 02:16:14,094
Right?

4349
02:16:14,370 --> 02:16:15,203
You have favorites.

4350
02:16:16,290 --> 02:16:17,340
You're going to be a doctor.

4351
02:16:17,790 --> 02:16:18,623
My oldest son,

4352
02:16:19,380 --> 02:16:20,250
you're going to be a doctor.

4353
02:16:21,090 --> 02:16:22,230
He wanted to be a builder.

4354
02:16:24,510 --> 02:16:25,710
He wanted to build.

4355
02:16:26,580 --> 02:16:27,413
He did both.

4356
02:16:27,900 --> 02:16:30,190
He built over 150 households that own,

4357
02:16:30,191 --> 02:16:31,330
he built tiff and things.

4358
02:16:31,331 --> 02:16:32,890
And how the fuck did he do that?

4359
02:16:32,950 --> 02:16:34,840
He did it as he was a doctor.

4360
02:16:34,900 --> 02:16:36,730
How did he have the time he bought,

4361
02:16:36,731 --> 02:16:37,660
he had contractor,

4362
02:16:37,780 --> 02:16:38,180
you know,

4363
02:16:38,180 --> 02:16:39,250
guy that did it.

4364
02:16:39,280 --> 02:16:40,050
But he,

4365
02:16:40,050 --> 02:16:41,620
he did that cause that was his passion.

4366
02:16:41,640 --> 02:16:42,161
Well he did,

4367
02:16:42,161 --> 02:16:42,611
but no,

4368
02:16:42,611 --> 02:16:43,080
but no,

4369
02:16:43,080 --> 02:16:43,240
no.

4370
02:16:43,240 --> 02:16:44,320
She was smarter than him.

4371
02:16:44,321 --> 02:16:45,580
She was smarter than anyone.

4372
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:47,530
He was supposed to be a doctor.

4373
02:16:48,100 --> 02:16:52,480
He was one of the greatest
diagnose cystic doctors ever.

4374
02:16:52,630 --> 02:16:53,650
I know it's my father.

4375
02:16:53,651 --> 02:16:54,461
I know the whole thing.

4376
02:16:54,461 --> 02:16:54,911
I get it,

4377
02:16:54,911 --> 02:16:56,050
but he really was.

4378
02:16:56,590 --> 02:16:57,251
You walked in,

4379
02:16:57,251 --> 02:16:58,360
he knew what was wrong with you.

4380
02:16:58,630 --> 02:16:59,231
There's a great,

4381
02:16:59,231 --> 02:16:59,710
again,

4382
02:16:59,710 --> 02:17:01,480
we don't know like the Babe Ruth thing,

4383
02:17:01,720 --> 02:17:03,430
we don't know the complete truth to it,

4384
02:17:03,640 --> 02:17:06,160
but there's a great legendary
story that a guy walked in,

4385
02:17:06,161 --> 02:17:07,420
he had been to Mayo Clinic,

4386
02:17:07,540 --> 02:17:08,890
he had been to John Hopkins,

4387
02:17:08,891 --> 02:17:10,270
he had been everywhere and was dying.

4388
02:17:10,420 --> 02:17:11,171
That's all they know.

4389
02:17:11,171 --> 02:17:11,740
Who's dying,

4390
02:17:11,740 --> 02:17:12,371
losing weight,

4391
02:17:12,371 --> 02:17:13,204
foreign apart,

4392
02:17:13,330 --> 02:17:14,163
dying,

4393
02:17:14,530 --> 02:17:15,940
and nobody could diagnose him.

4394
02:17:16,090 --> 02:17:19,630
He walked into this place where you had
to wait five hours to see him because

4395
02:17:19,631 --> 02:17:21,550
the line was out the door because he was,

4396
02:17:22,150 --> 02:17:27,150
had all the poor people and there were
cigarette burns in all the rugs and she

4397
02:17:28,481 --> 02:17:28,871
was like,

4398
02:17:28,871 --> 02:17:29,704
where am I?

4399
02:17:30,040 --> 02:17:31,630
But when you got to them,

4400
02:17:31,690 --> 02:17:32,560
you know where you are,

4401
02:17:33,130 --> 02:17:34,450
and he went there.

4402
02:17:34,451 --> 02:17:35,290
Somebody sent them,

4403
02:17:35,291 --> 02:17:39,370
they went there and my father may all
the patients leave and he gave himself an

4404
02:17:39,371 --> 02:17:40,204
injection.

4405
02:17:40,540 --> 02:17:41,800
That's the legendary story.

4406
02:17:42,910 --> 02:17:45,970
And I asked him about it
and I as it was a name,

4407
02:17:45,971 --> 02:17:47,110
I couldn't tell you the name,

4408
02:17:47,111 --> 02:17:47,650
whatever.

4409
02:17:47,650 --> 02:17:49,030
He made it real simple.

4410
02:17:49,031 --> 02:17:49,864
He said,

4411
02:17:49,900 --> 02:17:53,620
because he knew I watched movies and we
all watch movies and we owe her things

4412
02:17:53,621 --> 02:17:54,454
from different times.

4413
02:17:54,700 --> 02:17:58,270
And he said back in those days it
would have been called leprosy.

4414
02:17:58,750 --> 02:18:00,190
It was some kind of cancer

4415
02:18:01,930 --> 02:18:02,440
and against,

4416
02:18:02,440 --> 02:18:03,630
there was a contagious part tool,

4417
02:18:03,660 --> 02:18:04,420
whatever.

4418
02:18:04,420 --> 02:18:09,420
And he got everyone out of the office
and he diagnosed the guy came sofas shot.

4419
02:18:10,950 --> 02:18:12,220
He would give himself a shot.

4420
02:18:12,790 --> 02:18:13,330
Yeah,

4421
02:18:13,330 --> 02:18:14,163
too,

4422
02:18:14,170 --> 02:18:15,003
I guess.

4423
02:18:15,070 --> 02:18:15,850
I guess so.

4424
02:18:15,850 --> 02:18:16,570
I guess so.

4425
02:18:16,570 --> 02:18:16,841
I mean,

4426
02:18:16,841 --> 02:18:17,674
that's the story,

4427
02:18:17,820 --> 02:18:18,653
right.

4428
02:18:19,090 --> 02:18:19,923
And um,

4429
02:18:21,280 --> 02:18:22,420
he said to me though,

4430
02:18:22,480 --> 02:18:24,880
the only definitive thing
I know about that story,

4431
02:18:25,570 --> 02:18:26,530
and it was a million of them,

4432
02:18:26,860 --> 02:18:27,160
you know,

4433
02:18:27,160 --> 02:18:27,880
similar,

4434
02:18:27,880 --> 02:18:32,880
but was that I bragged to my fault,

4435
02:18:33,580 --> 02:18:35,440
you're smarter than all
these other doctors.

4436
02:18:35,441 --> 02:18:35,840
And he said,

4437
02:18:35,840 --> 02:18:36,673
Norma

4438
02:18:38,350 --> 02:18:38,891
and I said,

4439
02:18:38,891 --> 02:18:40,450
but you found it and these other places,

4440
02:18:41,710 --> 02:18:42,580
big hospital,

4441
02:18:42,730 --> 02:18:43,563
big problem.

4442
02:18:44,620 --> 02:18:45,760
I'm not a big hospital.

4443
02:18:47,080 --> 02:18:48,010
Big hospitals,

4444
02:18:48,190 --> 02:18:49,030
bigger problems.

4445
02:18:49,060 --> 02:18:49,271
I said,

4446
02:18:49,271 --> 02:18:54,271
what do you mean they have to do things
fast and with large numbers I don't.

4447
02:18:55,900 --> 02:18:56,830
So they have to.

4448
02:18:57,010 --> 02:18:58,150
It has to make sense.

4449
02:18:58,200 --> 02:18:59,650
Some things don't make sense.

4450
02:19:00,490 --> 02:19:01,323
That's what he told me.

4451
02:19:02,020 --> 02:19:02,411
He said,

4452
02:19:02,411 --> 02:19:03,900
so this particular day,

4453
02:19:04,040 --> 02:19:05,230
they are smarter than me.

4454
02:19:05,440 --> 02:19:07,870
They knew the characteristics
of the disease.

4455
02:19:08,050 --> 02:19:09,100
They knew the symptoms,

4456
02:19:09,280 --> 02:19:10,930
they knew that it fit in here,

4457
02:19:11,230 --> 02:19:15,760
but that hadn't been around for 40 years
and in the continental United States,

4458
02:19:15,761 --> 02:19:16,630
whenever he said to me,

4459
02:19:16,631 --> 02:19:17,920
but I remember it was something like that.

4460
02:19:18,180 --> 02:19:21,160
It hadn't been around for 40
maybe it was 60 but whatever.

4461
02:19:21,370 --> 02:19:22,270
It hadn't been around.

4462
02:19:22,390 --> 02:19:24,970
So they move right past
that because they had to go.

4463
02:19:24,971 --> 02:19:25,781
It's a big hearts,

4464
02:19:25,781 --> 02:19:29,450
but all they got to go quick
because I don't have to,

4465
02:19:31,370 --> 02:19:35,900
he says it didn't make sense to
them because it was around 40 years,

4466
02:19:37,280 --> 02:19:40,430
but he says if it is almost
like of walks like a duck,

4467
02:19:40,640 --> 02:19:41,600
quacks like a duck,

4468
02:19:42,500 --> 02:19:43,460
maybe it's a doc.

4469
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:44,890
So he just stayed.

4470
02:19:44,891 --> 02:19:45,890
He could stay with that.

4471
02:19:46,160 --> 02:19:49,220
They couldn't stay with that and
he stayed with and who was right.

4472
02:19:50,780 --> 02:19:51,613
And um,

4473
02:19:52,880 --> 02:19:54,440
he did a lot of things like that.

4474
02:19:54,470 --> 02:19:55,610
He was famous for that.

4475
02:19:56,060 --> 02:19:59,630
He was famous for people coming from
Brooklyn coming from Manhattan common over

4476
02:19:59,631 --> 02:20:01,390
there to see this diagnosis,

4477
02:20:01,391 --> 02:20:06,391
cystic genius and his little basement
office where people opt out the block,

4478
02:20:09,570 --> 02:20:12,650
like the Wayne for Mcdonald's or pizza.

4479
02:20:13,550 --> 02:20:15,650
And I'm going,

4480
02:20:15,660 --> 02:20:18,530
it cost less than Mcdonald's
to a certain extent,

4481
02:20:18,680 --> 02:20:19,280
you know,

4482
02:20:19,280 --> 02:20:21,650
because if we didn't have money
to in charge of like I said,

4483
02:20:22,100 --> 02:20:22,820
but he uh,

4484
02:20:22,820 --> 02:20:24,350
but he made money of course,

4485
02:20:24,980 --> 02:20:26,900
but he didn't make the money of the end.

4486
02:20:26,901 --> 02:20:27,770
He was a,

4487
02:20:28,130 --> 02:20:31,370
I tell you a great story to be a,

4488
02:20:31,430 --> 02:20:32,690
to have a nursing home.

4489
02:20:33,410 --> 02:20:36,350
Maybe this explains in the
best to have a nursing home.

4490
02:20:36,500 --> 02:20:39,080
You had to have open on stand on it,

4491
02:20:39,081 --> 02:20:42,380
I guess anywhere in New York you had
to have a doctor who's signed on as the

4492
02:20:42,381 --> 02:20:43,220
medical director.

4493
02:20:43,610 --> 02:20:46,810
The problem was they couldn't
pay it because the nursing
homes won't really make

4494
02:20:46,860 --> 02:20:47,630
money.

4495
02:20:47,630 --> 02:20:50,360
So you just had to have
a doctor would be there.

4496
02:20:50,960 --> 02:20:52,430
None of them really wanted to do it.

4497
02:20:52,460 --> 02:20:55,450
So my father was a
medical director and just,

4498
02:20:56,210 --> 02:20:57,290
just bear with me,

4499
02:20:57,320 --> 02:20:59,240
I'm going to say of eight nursing homes,

4500
02:20:59,470 --> 02:21:00,530
might have been five,

4501
02:21:00,780 --> 02:21:01,820
it might have been nine.

4502
02:21:03,980 --> 02:21:05,630
So I would go with them on house calls.

4503
02:21:05,690 --> 02:21:06,710
That's how I hung out with them.

4504
02:21:07,250 --> 02:21:08,840
So I go with them or nursing homes.

4505
02:21:09,020 --> 02:21:10,250
So of course he didn't get paid.

4506
02:21:10,251 --> 02:21:11,140
He was directed,

4507
02:21:11,150 --> 02:21:12,950
but he figured if he was that,

4508
02:21:12,980 --> 02:21:14,030
he never told me this,

4509
02:21:15,140 --> 02:21:18,020
but I think it's okay to say it.

4510
02:21:19,550 --> 02:21:21,260
He figured if I'm going to be there,

4511
02:21:21,261 --> 02:21:22,400
I'm going to go see the patients.

4512
02:21:22,401 --> 02:21:23,660
I'm not sure he didn't have to,

4513
02:21:24,470 --> 02:21:28,820
but he went once a week and he went into
each nursing home and I went with them

4514
02:21:28,821 --> 02:21:31,160
when I was with them
and he saw the patients.

4515
02:21:31,250 --> 02:21:33,200
So there's one day we
go win and he's like,

4516
02:21:35,190 --> 02:21:37,700
he gets treated like royalty.

4517
02:21:37,701 --> 02:21:38,431
I mean he comes in,

4518
02:21:38,431 --> 02:21:40,760
the staff comes running out
from all the nurse stays.

4519
02:21:40,761 --> 02:21:41,960
They all come on data,

4520
02:21:42,520 --> 02:21:42,800
you know?

4521
02:21:42,800 --> 02:21:43,820
And it made me feel good.

4522
02:21:44,780 --> 02:21:45,381
I was like,

4523
02:21:45,381 --> 02:21:45,710
wow,

4524
02:21:45,710 --> 02:21:46,543
I'm,

4525
02:21:46,820 --> 02:21:47,653
I'm with a man.

4526
02:21:48,290 --> 02:21:49,850
So I'm following them around.

4527
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,700
We've gone down the hallway
and he's very humble.

4528
02:21:52,701 --> 02:21:53,720
He really truly is.

4529
02:21:53,721 --> 02:21:54,800
That word is overused,

4530
02:21:55,130 --> 02:21:58,550
but this guy was beyond the
humble like directed thing.

4531
02:21:58,551 --> 02:21:59,384
We'd go this way,

4532
02:21:59,430 --> 02:22:00,620
the the needle,

4533
02:22:00,920 --> 02:22:01,790
it was ridiculous.

4534
02:22:01,791 --> 02:22:03,430
He get mad if you said
some good about him.

4535
02:22:04,460 --> 02:22:05,293
So

4536
02:22:06,620 --> 02:22:07,720
they all colonies where he,

4537
02:22:07,740 --> 02:22:08,573
uh,

4538
02:22:08,740 --> 02:22:09,480
hey,

4539
02:22:09,480 --> 02:22:10,370
you have to charge.

4540
02:22:10,400 --> 02:22:10,760
Yeah,

4541
02:22:10,760 --> 02:22:11,480
come on.

4542
02:22:11,480 --> 02:22:14,360
So he's looking at the charge
to change his medicine,

4543
02:22:14,361 --> 02:22:15,200
give him 100 million,

4544
02:22:15,230 --> 02:22:15,561
you know,

4545
02:22:15,561 --> 02:22:19,310
the typical stuff that I know from
watching Dr Kildare or something.

4546
02:22:19,470 --> 02:22:20,303
Right.

4547
02:22:22,490 --> 02:22:23,323
So

4548
02:22:24,800 --> 02:22:25,633
He's,

4549
02:22:25,650 --> 02:22:25,921
you know,

4550
02:22:25,921 --> 02:22:26,070
and

4551
02:22:26,070 --> 02:22:27,770
he's doing his thing and he's going down.

4552
02:22:27,780 --> 02:22:28,850
I'm following them around.

4553
02:22:28,860 --> 02:22:29,693
I'm old.

4554
02:22:29,760 --> 02:22:30,720
I don't know how old I was,

4555
02:22:30,721 --> 02:22:31,500
but young,

4556
02:22:31,500 --> 02:22:32,333
10

4557
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:39,090
11 so I'm found more
of a sudden this woman.

4558
02:22:40,550 --> 02:22:41,281
Do you ever see,

4559
02:22:41,281 --> 02:22:41,791
I don't know,

4560
02:22:41,791 --> 02:22:43,080
I jumped around with these things,

4561
02:22:43,081 --> 02:22:45,450
but you ever see the movie?

4562
02:22:45,720 --> 02:22:50,700
It was comedy guy that was around
back then and he said like a bride of

4563
02:22:50,701 --> 02:22:51,540
Frankenstein.

4564
02:22:51,541 --> 02:22:52,440
And he did Brooks.

4565
02:22:52,500 --> 02:22:53,190
Yeah.

4566
02:22:53,190 --> 02:22:55,670
It was one of his movies and
the bride of Frankenstein,

4567
02:22:55,740 --> 02:22:57,270
the white hair was like,

4568
02:22:57,720 --> 02:22:57,901
well,

4569
02:22:57,901 --> 02:22:59,640
this woman was the bride of Frankenstein.

4570
02:23:00,450 --> 02:23:05,350
She comes running out and she was the
shelf and she was like half nude and,

4571
02:23:05,360 --> 02:23:10,360
and her gown was fallen off and she's an
older lady and her white hair was like

4572
02:23:10,771 --> 02:23:11,400
that.

4573
02:23:11,400 --> 02:23:15,840
And she comes running and she's yelling
incoherent and screaming and they jump

4574
02:23:16,800 --> 02:23:17,611
and they jump.

4575
02:23:17,611 --> 02:23:20,260
When they started putting
straps around the,

4576
02:23:20,300 --> 02:23:22,320
I guess like the old white coat I guess.

4577
02:23:22,740 --> 02:23:23,490
And they go,

4578
02:23:23,490 --> 02:23:26,040
apparently she was tied up to a bed,

4579
02:23:26,190 --> 02:23:26,730
you know,

4580
02:23:26,730 --> 02:23:29,670
obviously back in those days they
didn't know how to deal with,

4581
02:23:29,671 --> 02:23:30,840
see now people the way,

4582
02:23:31,110 --> 02:23:31,261
you know,

4583
02:23:31,261 --> 02:23:32,220
it was a whole different thing.

4584
02:23:32,430 --> 02:23:32,701
I mean,

4585
02:23:32,701 --> 02:23:34,020
we're talking a lot of years ago.

4586
02:23:34,440 --> 02:23:39,440
And so they had a tied up and she got
loose and her gown was fallen off in.

4587
02:23:39,561 --> 02:23:40,394
She's,

4588
02:23:40,470 --> 02:23:41,340
and uh,

4589
02:23:42,120 --> 02:23:47,120
so they jump up on her and they're tying
her up and I'm watching this woman get

4590
02:23:47,461 --> 02:23:51,840
mugged in the nursing home than my
father is the medical director of.

4591
02:23:53,070 --> 02:23:53,910
And all of a sudden he said,

4592
02:23:53,911 --> 02:23:54,744
leave alone.

4593
02:23:55,670 --> 02:23:57,150
And he's still looking at his charts.

4594
02:23:57,151 --> 02:23:57,984
He's not like,

4595
02:23:57,990 --> 02:23:58,380
hey,

4596
02:23:58,380 --> 02:23:58,910
Yo,

4597
02:23:58,910 --> 02:23:59,743
a

4598
02:24:00,770 --> 02:24:01,660
illegal,

4599
02:24:02,840 --> 02:24:03,631
but it's okay.

4600
02:24:03,631 --> 02:24:04,464
She's fine.

4601
02:24:04,950 --> 02:24:05,783
She'll be all right.

4602
02:24:06,410 --> 02:24:08,130
And she calmed down.

4603
02:24:09,270 --> 02:24:11,550
She was a little nuts,

4604
02:24:11,790 --> 02:24:12,623
but

4605
02:24:13,590 --> 02:24:14,460
she was not spank.

4606
02:24:14,480 --> 02:24:14,741
Right?

4607
02:24:14,741 --> 02:24:14,911
Yeah.

4608
02:24:14,911 --> 02:24:15,640
That's a fair,

4609
02:24:15,640 --> 02:24:17,730
that's it's okay to say it's realistic.

4610
02:24:18,030 --> 02:24:18,863
And

4611
02:24:21,060 --> 02:24:22,470
she comes over with my father,

4612
02:24:22,890 --> 02:24:23,251
she says,

4613
02:24:23,251 --> 02:24:24,084
Hey,

4614
02:24:24,420 --> 02:24:28,320
and he's writing and he starts walking,

4615
02:24:28,770 --> 02:24:29,750
she starts falling.

4616
02:24:30,920 --> 02:24:34,140
And I'm a kid so I can figure it
all out the way I could later.

4617
02:24:34,170 --> 02:24:35,003
Right.

4618
02:24:35,370 --> 02:24:38,430
But she becomes his assistant basically.

4619
02:24:38,431 --> 02:24:40,920
She's following him around and she,

4620
02:24:40,921 --> 02:24:44,540
he's going to room to room and she's,

4621
02:24:45,330 --> 02:24:46,440
I think he gave her,

4622
02:24:46,441 --> 02:24:47,520
if I remember correctly,

4623
02:24:47,521 --> 02:24:48,840
he gave us like the,

4624
02:24:48,841 --> 02:24:49,470
the,

4625
02:24:49,470 --> 02:24:52,380
the thing that you write on a billboard,

4626
02:24:52,410 --> 02:24:53,243
you know the thing,

4627
02:24:53,480 --> 02:24:54,200
uh,

4628
02:24:54,200 --> 02:24:54,540
yeah.

4629
02:24:54,540 --> 02:24:55,800
Clipboard to hold.

4630
02:24:55,950 --> 02:25:00,450
So she's holding a clipboard and she's
looking like she's making believe she's

4631
02:25:00,451 --> 02:25:01,800
reading stuff and,

4632
02:25:01,801 --> 02:25:02,510
and,

4633
02:25:02,510 --> 02:25:04,380
and I don't like looking
at the scene like,

4634
02:25:05,030 --> 02:25:05,461
you know,

4635
02:25:05,461 --> 02:25:06,181
but I'm a kid,

4636
02:25:06,181 --> 02:25:10,430
like I haven't seen all the movies yet
that I can compare it that this is,

4637
02:25:10,590 --> 02:25:11,670
this is out there,

4638
02:25:11,790 --> 02:25:12,623
you know what I mean?

4639
02:25:12,720 --> 02:25:13,980
This is freaking nuts.

4640
02:25:14,890 --> 02:25:15,261
And,

4641
02:25:15,261 --> 02:25:16,530
and she found around,

4642
02:25:16,531 --> 02:25:18,750
she's looking at the thing
and I think she's like saying,

4643
02:25:18,751 --> 02:25:19,060
yeah,

4644
02:25:19,060 --> 02:25:19,893
yes.

4645
02:25:20,070 --> 02:25:20,903
She said,

4646
02:25:21,090 --> 02:25:22,350
and he's going and he's,

4647
02:25:22,470 --> 02:25:24,190
he's basically not even

4648
02:25:24,520 --> 02:25:25,301
paying attention.

4649
02:25:25,301 --> 02:25:26,134
He's just,

4650
02:25:26,410 --> 02:25:27,250
every once in a while I said,

4651
02:25:27,310 --> 02:25:28,143
let me have to,

4652
02:25:28,180 --> 02:25:30,040
and he's doing and all of a sudden,

4653
02:25:31,210 --> 02:25:32,410
and this is the part again,

4654
02:25:32,411 --> 02:25:35,050
just like the other thing I
think about leaving it out,

4655
02:25:35,230 --> 02:25:36,130
but if I leave it out,

4656
02:25:36,131 --> 02:25:37,180
it's not a story.

4657
02:25:37,540 --> 02:25:40,360
It's not a story because
if I left it like that,

4658
02:25:40,361 --> 02:25:41,440
it's a beautiful story,

4659
02:25:43,030 --> 02:25:48,030
but this is a beautiful story in its
own way because it is what it is.

4660
02:25:48,460 --> 02:25:49,293
It's a real,

4661
02:25:49,900 --> 02:25:51,070
he's in front of a,

4662
02:25:51,450 --> 02:25:52,510
and my mother was,

4663
02:25:52,620 --> 02:25:54,970
I described as she was his gorgeous,

4664
02:25:54,971 --> 02:25:57,910
beautiful woman that like good things.

4665
02:25:57,970 --> 02:25:59,830
My father could give a crap.

4666
02:26:00,580 --> 02:26:05,110
My father had ink stains exploding
in his white shirt pockets.

4667
02:26:05,410 --> 02:26:07,030
My mother would go crazy.

4668
02:26:07,480 --> 02:26:09,150
He went to Kmart and avi,

4669
02:26:09,200 --> 02:26:10,090
remember Kmart,

4670
02:26:10,270 --> 02:26:14,110
he went to Kmart and borders
all shoes for four 99 each,

4671
02:26:14,500 --> 02:26:17,440
maybe three 90 I plastic shoes.

4672
02:26:17,740 --> 02:26:19,570
And my mother was buying
him leather shoes.

4673
02:26:19,690 --> 02:26:20,710
He never warned him.

4674
02:26:20,711 --> 02:26:22,080
If he knew what she paid for me,

4675
02:26:22,081 --> 02:26:23,230
he would have went nuts.

4676
02:26:24,370 --> 02:26:27,490
Waste waste for what?

4677
02:26:28,030 --> 02:26:28,750
That was his,

4678
02:26:28,750 --> 02:26:29,583
that was him.

4679
02:26:29,680 --> 02:26:34,680
So he's got these plants and shoes and
you know he's got the inks blow up in his

4680
02:26:34,751 --> 02:26:36,790
pockets and everything else.

4681
02:26:37,330 --> 02:26:39,280
And My mother would always get upset,

4682
02:26:39,430 --> 02:26:40,300
always mad.

4683
02:26:40,330 --> 02:26:41,950
Why do you wear those shoes?

4684
02:26:41,951 --> 02:26:42,140
I,

4685
02:26:42,140 --> 02:26:42,670
yeah,

4686
02:26:42,670 --> 02:26:43,740
but he does.

4687
02:26:44,380 --> 02:26:49,300
So he's walking in front of her and
all of a sudden everything changes.

4688
02:26:50,710 --> 02:26:51,700
The woman goes,

4689
02:26:53,140 --> 02:26:54,460
he's neither doctor

4690
02:26:56,140 --> 02:26:56,973
she'd see.

4691
02:26:57,070 --> 02:26:57,920
She flipped on him.

4692
02:26:58,060 --> 02:26:59,020
Can you imagine this?

4693
02:26:59,650 --> 02:27:01,720
She could have to be in so great to her.

4694
02:27:02,620 --> 02:27:06,370
He's not a barely gets his
attention still walking.

4695
02:27:07,330 --> 02:27:08,600
He's not a doctor.

4696
02:27:08,620 --> 02:27:09,453
Everybody.

4697
02:27:09,490 --> 02:27:11,200
He's got holes in his shoes.

4698
02:27:12,250 --> 02:27:13,040
I looked down,

4699
02:27:13,040 --> 02:27:13,960
his foot goes up,

4700
02:27:13,990 --> 02:27:14,980
he's got a whole new shoes,

4701
02:27:14,981 --> 02:27:15,750
socks to canal,

4702
02:27:15,750 --> 02:27:16,583
the shoe.

4703
02:27:17,350 --> 02:27:18,183
She was right.

4704
02:27:18,760 --> 02:27:21,700
It's got a hole of his freaking
shoe and his plastic shoe.

4705
02:27:22,720 --> 02:27:23,560
He doesn't care.

4706
02:27:24,740 --> 02:27:25,030
She,

4707
02:27:25,030 --> 02:27:25,780
he,

4708
02:27:25,780 --> 02:27:26,800
he can't be a doctor.

4709
02:27:26,801 --> 02:27:27,970
He's got holes in his shoes

4710
02:27:29,950 --> 02:27:30,191
now.

4711
02:27:30,191 --> 02:27:31,024
He turns around,

4712
02:27:32,560 --> 02:27:33,393
he looks at her,

4713
02:27:34,350 --> 02:27:35,470
I never forget this.

4714
02:27:36,040 --> 02:27:37,750
He pats her on the head says,

4715
02:27:37,751 --> 02:27:38,710
you're not so crazy.

4716
02:27:42,370 --> 02:27:44,530
Pats her on the head just like this.

4717
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:46,360
And now they're in a demeaning way.

4718
02:27:46,361 --> 02:27:47,230
Like you might think,

4719
02:27:47,231 --> 02:27:48,064
you know what I mean?

4720
02:27:48,280 --> 02:27:48,641
Really?

4721
02:27:48,641 --> 02:27:51,100
He touched her on her head and said,

4722
02:27:51,101 --> 02:27:51,640
you're not,

4723
02:27:51,640 --> 02:27:52,840
you're not so crazy.

4724
02:27:53,890 --> 02:27:54,500
Turned around,

4725
02:27:54,500 --> 02:27:56,020
took the billboard and kept walking.

4726
02:27:56,560 --> 02:27:57,700
She didn't say another word.

4727
02:28:06,060 --> 02:28:11,060
My mother was freaking embarrassed and
mad because I told the story when I got

4728
02:28:11,411 --> 02:28:14,290
home and of course he would never tell it.

4729
02:28:14,830 --> 02:28:15,970
And I said,

4730
02:28:15,971 --> 02:28:16,481
you know dad,

4731
02:28:16,481 --> 02:28:16,661
you know,

4732
02:28:16,661 --> 02:28:18,010
I said like a kid would say,

4733
02:28:18,550 --> 02:28:18,761
you know,

4734
02:28:18,761 --> 02:28:19,511
there's ladies said,

4735
02:28:19,511 --> 02:28:19,721
you know,

4736
02:28:19,721 --> 02:28:20,554
he's got a horse.

4737
02:28:21,020 --> 02:28:21,920
Oh my God.

4738
02:28:22,820 --> 02:28:23,420
You know,

4739
02:28:23,420 --> 02:28:24,250
Jesus,

4740
02:28:24,250 --> 02:28:24,890
you know?

4741
02:28:24,890 --> 02:28:25,470
Right.

4742
02:28:25,470 --> 02:28:26,303
Didn't meet anything.

4743
02:28:27,570 --> 02:28:27,860
Yeah.

4744
02:28:27,860 --> 02:28:28,693
Well that makes

4745
02:28:29,330 --> 02:28:30,350
just this,

4746
02:28:31,430 --> 02:28:32,630
your description,

4747
02:28:32,631 --> 02:28:35,130
your understanding of your father.

4748
02:28:35,131 --> 02:28:36,920
It just makes so much sense now.

4749
02:28:37,260 --> 02:28:39,460
So much sense of who you are and why you,

4750
02:28:39,470 --> 02:28:42,050
why your principles are so rigid,

4751
02:28:42,550 --> 02:28:43,200
why you,

4752
02:28:43,200 --> 02:28:44,990
you're intolerant of any bullshit.

4753
02:28:45,610 --> 02:28:46,790
Just makes so much sense

4754
02:28:49,310 --> 02:28:53,840
as a fight trainer and as a guy who
understands finders as a commentator and

4755
02:28:53,841 --> 02:28:55,610
make so much sense that you,

4756
02:28:55,640 --> 02:29:00,640
you have this just unyielding
need for 100% commitment.

4757
02:29:03,950 --> 02:29:04,281
Yeah.

4758
02:29:04,281 --> 02:29:05,114
I mean,

4759
02:29:06,600 --> 02:29:07,180
okay.

4760
02:29:07,180 --> 02:29:08,013
So just told her,

4761
02:29:08,060 --> 02:29:08,590
listen,

4762
02:29:08,590 --> 02:29:11,180
it doesn't make me a better
person or anything else to say,

4763
02:29:11,710 --> 02:29:13,150
but I don't have a tolerance.

4764
02:29:13,220 --> 02:29:15,770
I don't have tolerance for the BS.

4765
02:29:15,800 --> 02:29:16,633
Right.

4766
02:29:17,360 --> 02:29:19,010
Because I know to be bs.

4767
02:29:19,070 --> 02:29:19,903
Right.

4768
02:29:20,360 --> 02:29:20,920
You know,

4769
02:29:20,920 --> 02:29:21,111
I,

4770
02:29:21,111 --> 02:29:23,010
I say to we,

4771
02:29:23,210 --> 02:29:27,340
we were running these gyms
in la for the last nine.

4772
02:29:27,341 --> 02:29:28,071
You're 22 years.

4773
02:29:28,071 --> 02:29:28,904
I've listened.

4774
02:29:28,910 --> 02:29:29,361
When he died,

4775
02:29:29,361 --> 02:29:31,010
I started to ducktail this foundation

4776
02:29:33,260 --> 02:29:33,680
again,

4777
02:29:33,680 --> 02:29:34,540
there was no statute.

4778
02:29:34,541 --> 02:29:35,270
Okay.

4779
02:29:35,270 --> 02:29:36,800
So I really,

4780
02:29:36,920 --> 02:29:41,920
I went to a supreme court judge who was
a friend on stand down because I used to

4781
02:29:43,161 --> 02:29:46,160
be in front of the judge is
when I was young and a bad way.

4782
02:29:46,610 --> 02:29:47,040
And,

4783
02:29:47,040 --> 02:29:47,873
uh,

4784
02:29:48,340 --> 02:29:49,760
because I got myself in a little trouble,

4785
02:29:50,120 --> 02:29:50,953
stupid,

4786
02:29:51,260 --> 02:29:51,710
you know,

4787
02:29:51,710 --> 02:29:52,730
but I got to the right place.

4788
02:29:52,731 --> 02:29:53,564
That's what counts,

4789
02:29:54,080 --> 02:29:54,440
right.

4790
02:29:54,440 --> 02:29:55,273
I think.

4791
02:29:55,400 --> 02:29:56,060
And um,

4792
02:29:56,060 --> 02:29:59,870
but I always got a kick out of it that
I could hang out with the judge and I

4793
02:29:59,871 --> 02:30:01,610
didn't have to be in a court to do it,

4794
02:30:01,640 --> 02:30:02,080
you know?

4795
02:30:02,080 --> 02:30:02,913
Right.

4796
02:30:02,930 --> 02:30:04,920
And I didn't have to be
standing like in front of them.

4797
02:30:04,921 --> 02:30:06,500
I could be on the side of like,

4798
02:30:06,590 --> 02:30:07,423
hey,

4799
02:30:08,930 --> 02:30:09,763
so,

4800
02:30:10,100 --> 02:30:10,933
um,

4801
02:30:12,950 --> 02:30:17,210
I've got a few people together and I
started the doc that was foundation to 22

4802
02:30:17,211 --> 02:30:19,560
years ago and uh,

4803
02:30:20,270 --> 02:30:22,010
we've grown quite a bit,

4804
02:30:22,011 --> 02:30:24,470
but just a little grassroots thing,

4805
02:30:24,471 --> 02:30:25,430
but it's grown.

4806
02:30:26,060 --> 02:30:26,893
Um,

4807
02:30:27,080 --> 02:30:30,220
we probably give away a real help.

4808
02:30:31,100 --> 02:30:35,330
We have one paid person and
one office has 1400 a month.

4809
02:30:35,810 --> 02:30:36,590
That's it.

4810
02:30:36,590 --> 02:30:37,190
Um,

4811
02:30:37,190 --> 02:30:41,540
so no administrative costs
other than Knowles and um,

4812
02:30:41,840 --> 02:30:42,673
that's it.

4813
02:30:43,040 --> 02:30:48,040
Nobody could salaries to start one person
and all the money goes to the cases

4814
02:30:49,340 --> 02:30:50,173
and uh,

4815
02:30:50,720 --> 02:30:51,800
we probably give away.

4816
02:30:56,100 --> 02:30:56,933
Okay.

4817
02:30:57,310 --> 02:30:58,480
600,000,

4818
02:30:58,481 --> 02:30:59,710
700,000 a year.

4819
02:31:00,120 --> 02:31:00,610
Um,

4820
02:31:00,610 --> 02:31:01,540
but direct help,

4821
02:31:02,020 --> 02:31:02,441
um,

4822
02:31:02,441 --> 02:31:03,274
we don't,

4823
02:31:03,370 --> 02:31:04,330
we don't give to the,

4824
02:31:04,331 --> 02:31:05,164
you know,

4825
02:31:05,410 --> 02:31:06,910
we don't give to march of dimes.

4826
02:31:06,911 --> 02:31:07,990
We don't give it to them.

4827
02:31:07,991 --> 02:31:10,000
We don't give it to patients.

4828
02:31:10,590 --> 02:31:11,040
Again,

4829
02:31:11,040 --> 02:31:11,740
Red Cross,

4830
02:31:11,740 --> 02:31:12,640
we give it directly.

4831
02:31:12,641 --> 02:31:12,911
We've,

4832
02:31:12,911 --> 02:31:13,420
we,

4833
02:31:13,420 --> 02:31:17,650
they come to us now because we were
out there to an extent where people all

4834
02:31:17,651 --> 02:31:17,891
know,

4835
02:31:17,891 --> 02:31:19,980
but they come to us,

4836
02:31:20,850 --> 02:31:22,700
they have a kid with cerebral palsy,

4837
02:31:22,710 --> 02:31:23,670
needs a certain bike,

4838
02:31:23,671 --> 02:31:25,020
the bike cause $1,500,

4839
02:31:25,021 --> 02:31:25,440
bang,

4840
02:31:25,440 --> 02:31:25,950
boom,

4841
02:31:25,950 --> 02:31:26,783
got the bike.

4842
02:31:26,970 --> 02:31:27,870
We got another way.

4843
02:31:27,871 --> 02:31:30,840
It needs a machine that
circulates the blood in his legs.

4844
02:31:30,841 --> 02:31:31,111
Of course,

4845
02:31:31,111 --> 02:31:32,040
25 hour bang.

4846
02:31:32,041 --> 02:31:32,750
You got it.

4847
02:31:32,750 --> 02:31:34,170
[inaudible] obviously we,

4848
02:31:35,190 --> 02:31:36,630
we make sure it's legitimate.

4849
02:31:36,720 --> 02:31:37,890
We research it,

4850
02:31:37,920 --> 02:31:38,611
we do that.

4851
02:31:38,611 --> 02:31:39,444
We have a board,

4852
02:31:39,660 --> 02:31:44,010
we make sure drill or we do do make sure
it really is real because you do get

4853
02:31:44,011 --> 02:31:45,330
people to take advantage of a little bit,

4854
02:31:46,040 --> 02:31:46,873
but,

4855
02:31:47,620 --> 02:31:48,360
and we do it.

4856
02:31:48,360 --> 02:31:53,310
We act on it because my father never
made people feel less when they were poor

4857
02:31:53,580 --> 02:31:54,690
or when they needed something.

4858
02:31:55,110 --> 02:31:56,310
That was the greatest thing he did.

4859
02:31:56,311 --> 02:31:58,560
He never made them lose
more than they lost already.

4860
02:31:59,040 --> 02:31:59,910
Their integrity.

4861
02:31:59,940 --> 02:32:00,420
Never,

4862
02:32:00,420 --> 02:32:00,900
never,

4863
02:32:00,900 --> 02:32:01,733
never.

4864
02:32:01,850 --> 02:32:02,700
He never made him feel,

4865
02:32:02,701 --> 02:32:03,550
he didn't show it.

4866
02:32:03,760 --> 02:32:04,950
I remember one time,

4867
02:32:04,951 --> 02:32:07,470
it was Christmas Eve when it was
I hanging out and I was a kid.

4868
02:32:07,471 --> 02:32:07,801
I was in,

4869
02:32:07,801 --> 02:32:08,250
um,

4870
02:32:08,250 --> 02:32:10,650
I was at my father's office
because I want her to be with them.

4871
02:32:10,950 --> 02:32:14,190
And it was Christmas Eve and it was late
and we were still in the office and a

4872
02:32:14,191 --> 02:32:14,521
woman,

4873
02:32:14,521 --> 02:32:15,001
I remember,

4874
02:32:15,001 --> 02:32:16,050
she was a Spanish woman.

4875
02:32:16,260 --> 02:32:16,801
She came in,

4876
02:32:16,801 --> 02:32:21,801
she has six kids and and she was nervous
and I remember watching how nervous she

4877
02:32:22,321 --> 02:32:22,531
was.

4878
02:32:22,531 --> 02:32:23,364
I was like,

4879
02:32:23,370 --> 02:32:24,161
even though I was young,

4880
02:32:24,161 --> 02:32:27,480
it was like she's really
nervous and I found out,

4881
02:32:27,510 --> 02:32:28,920
I learned about human behavior.

4882
02:32:28,920 --> 02:32:33,450
I learned about what it was and
I'm watching her and sure enough,

4883
02:32:33,840 --> 02:32:34,770
she was getting ready.

4884
02:32:34,950 --> 02:32:36,570
When the last kid got taken care of,

4885
02:32:36,780 --> 02:32:37,950
she was going to dot out of there.

4886
02:32:37,951 --> 02:32:40,200
She didn't have money and the poor woman,

4887
02:32:40,470 --> 02:32:41,303
she was she,

4888
02:32:41,700 --> 02:32:43,200
she had to take care of her kids.

4889
02:32:43,380 --> 02:32:44,580
She didn't want to do that,

4890
02:32:44,730 --> 02:32:49,080
but she was going to run out of there
because she did not have money and he

4891
02:32:49,081 --> 02:32:50,990
recognized me take announced.

4892
02:32:51,190 --> 02:32:52,140
I didn't know what it was,

4893
02:32:52,141 --> 02:32:53,850
so I'm not going to say
I thought I was smart,

4894
02:32:54,030 --> 02:32:55,350
but I recognize something.

4895
02:32:55,620 --> 02:32:57,540
All this motion or there's nervousness.

4896
02:32:57,750 --> 02:32:58,800
It was a normal,

4897
02:32:59,340 --> 02:33:03,570
he recognized at all and
before he got to the last kid,

4898
02:33:03,810 --> 02:33:05,400
so he wouldn't embarrass her,

4899
02:33:05,550 --> 02:33:10,320
so she wouldn't run out of there and do
that to itself and lose something more

4900
02:33:10,321 --> 02:33:11,460
than she lost already.

4901
02:33:12,780 --> 02:33:13,613
He said,

4902
02:33:13,770 --> 02:33:15,060
this one's on me.

4903
02:33:16,680 --> 02:33:18,150
And the nervousness went away.

4904
02:33:18,270 --> 02:33:18,661
She said,

4905
02:33:18,661 --> 02:33:19,650
there's no charge today.

4906
02:33:19,920 --> 02:33:20,251
He said,

4907
02:33:20,251 --> 02:33:21,630
there's no charge today.

4908
02:33:22,770 --> 02:33:25,050
And I don't know if she spoke English,

4909
02:33:25,051 --> 02:33:29,580
but she understood it and he made her
understand it and there was no charge

4910
02:33:29,581 --> 02:33:30,390
today.

4911
02:33:30,390 --> 02:33:31,830
And soon as he said that,

4912
02:33:32,310 --> 02:33:33,390
everything changed.

4913
02:33:33,750 --> 02:33:34,830
Everything changed.

4914
02:33:34,831 --> 02:33:35,581
He wasn't nervous,

4915
02:33:35,581 --> 02:33:39,500
he wasn't looking at doors and she,

4916
02:33:40,140 --> 02:33:40,973
she cried

4917
02:33:43,110 --> 02:33:44,250
and she left.

4918
02:33:45,280 --> 02:33:46,113
And when she left,

4919
02:33:46,200 --> 02:33:49,200
the place was packed
because that was his office.

4920
02:33:50,250 --> 02:33:52,480
And all of a sudden he's,

4921
02:33:52,910 --> 02:33:54,540
I've talked to himself a little bit,

4922
02:33:54,570 --> 02:33:55,680
just just for a second.

4923
02:33:55,710 --> 02:33:55,951
I mean,

4924
02:33:55,951 --> 02:33:56,890
he didn't do this on where,

4925
02:33:56,900 --> 02:33:57,600
you know,

4926
02:33:57,600 --> 02:33:58,970
but he just like said,

4927
02:33:59,060 --> 02:33:59,220
yeah,

4928
02:33:59,220 --> 02:34:00,960
it wasn't like that.

4929
02:34:01,080 --> 02:34:01,291
You know,

4930
02:34:01,291 --> 02:34:02,124
I wasn't thinking,

4931
02:34:04,500 --> 02:34:05,430
of course he wasn't taking it.

4932
02:34:05,431 --> 02:34:06,750
He didn't know it was Christmas Eve.

4933
02:34:07,060 --> 02:34:07,650
Right.

4934
02:34:07,650 --> 02:34:10,170
So he turns to me and
he gives me a mission,

4935
02:34:10,171 --> 02:34:12,230
a job he opens,

4936
02:34:12,530 --> 02:34:13,290
it takes out as,

4937
02:34:13,290 --> 02:34:14,790
and it gives me a $50 bill.

4938
02:34:15,390 --> 02:34:15,751
He says,

4939
02:34:15,751 --> 02:34:17,530
go find that she's probably on a bus stop.

4940
02:34:19,060 --> 02:34:24,060
I ran out that door like I like I was
given the greatest mission in the world

4941
02:34:24,880 --> 02:34:27,820
high felt so proud I could,

4942
02:34:27,821 --> 02:34:28,840
I ran,

4943
02:34:28,841 --> 02:34:30,400
I knew where the bus stop was fabulous.

4944
02:34:30,640 --> 02:34:31,810
I was going to run all of them,

4945
02:34:32,410 --> 02:34:35,320
but she was at the first
one down on Bay street,

4946
02:34:36,520 --> 02:34:37,420
right around the corner,

4947
02:34:37,630 --> 02:34:40,990
down block two blocks and I,

4948
02:34:41,200 --> 02:34:43,320
she's there and showing off stage.

4949
02:34:43,321 --> 02:34:44,560
She has done a post.

4950
02:34:44,561 --> 02:34:45,191
I went up to,

4951
02:34:45,191 --> 02:34:46,024
I said,

4952
02:34:46,270 --> 02:34:50,140
the doctor said it gives
you this and you know,

4953
02:34:50,860 --> 02:34:51,940
she looked at it.

4954
02:34:51,941 --> 02:34:52,450
She,

4955
02:34:52,450 --> 02:34:52,770
you know,

4956
02:34:52,770 --> 02:34:53,603
she,

4957
02:34:54,190 --> 02:34:54,880
she couldn't,

4958
02:34:54,880 --> 02:34:55,713
she was shocked,

4959
02:34:56,380 --> 02:34:57,213
but she,

4960
02:34:57,640 --> 02:34:58,840
she started crying again.

4961
02:35:00,160 --> 02:35:03,880
But I felt so good because like
I felt like I was part of it,

4962
02:35:04,450 --> 02:35:05,283
you know.

4963
02:35:05,770 --> 02:35:06,281
And um,

4964
02:35:06,281 --> 02:35:09,100
so I started this foundation and I said,

4965
02:35:09,320 --> 02:35:09,550
you know,

4966
02:35:09,550 --> 02:35:10,383
I needed help.

4967
02:35:10,510 --> 02:35:10,961
And he said,

4968
02:35:10,961 --> 02:35:11,794
look,

4969
02:35:12,910 --> 02:35:13,870
we're going to do what he did.

4970
02:35:14,350 --> 02:35:15,183
No red tape.

4971
02:35:15,790 --> 02:35:17,080
No losing your pride.

4972
02:35:18,580 --> 02:35:19,930
People that fall through the cracks.

4973
02:35:19,931 --> 02:35:20,741
That's my father.

4974
02:35:20,741 --> 02:35:21,101
He was,

4975
02:35:21,101 --> 02:35:21,371
he was,

4976
02:35:21,371 --> 02:35:22,600
he had a phd in that.

4977
02:35:23,320 --> 02:35:25,120
All the people to fell to the cracks.

4978
02:35:25,121 --> 02:35:26,080
He took care of more.

4979
02:35:26,830 --> 02:35:27,221
I said,

4980
02:35:27,221 --> 02:35:29,860
we're going to take care of
the ones you know much good.

4981
02:35:29,861 --> 02:35:30,221
This fee,

4982
02:35:30,221 --> 02:35:31,330
great organization.

4983
02:35:31,331 --> 02:35:32,410
But two people out there,

4984
02:35:32,411 --> 02:35:32,980
no,

4985
02:35:32,980 --> 02:35:33,731
not a bad way,

4986
02:35:33,731 --> 02:35:38,560
but did you know like 87% goes to
administrative costs and like 4% goes to

4987
02:35:38,561 --> 02:35:39,340
research.

4988
02:35:39,340 --> 02:35:41,110
These people don't need
research in their life.

4989
02:35:41,111 --> 02:35:41,890
They've told me that.

4990
02:35:41,890 --> 02:35:42,431
I know it,

4991
02:35:42,431 --> 02:35:43,264
I recognize it.

4992
02:35:43,380 --> 02:35:44,213
You know what they need?

4993
02:35:44,350 --> 02:35:45,370
They need a wheelchair.

4994
02:35:45,670 --> 02:35:47,500
You know they need a handicap ramp.

4995
02:35:47,501 --> 02:35:48,330
Do you know what they need?

4996
02:35:48,330 --> 02:35:48,671
They can't.

4997
02:35:48,671 --> 02:35:49,870
Cancer Medication paid for.

4998
02:35:49,990 --> 02:35:50,411
You know what?

4999
02:35:50,411 --> 02:35:53,980
They need the utilities to be kept on
when they're being shut off because they

5000
02:35:53,981 --> 02:35:54,610
can't afford,

5001
02:35:54,610 --> 02:35:55,450
you know what they need?

5002
02:35:55,570 --> 02:35:58,750
They need the back rent paid because
someone got sick and one of the people

5003
02:35:58,751 --> 02:36:02,860
working there had to quit the job and
they were going to be put into a shelter

5004
02:36:02,861 --> 02:36:03,730
with six kids.

5005
02:36:04,560 --> 02:36:05,770
So we pay the back rent,

5006
02:36:05,920 --> 02:36:07,390
we paid the utility costs,

5007
02:36:07,510 --> 02:36:08,800
we pay the cancer Medicaid,

5008
02:36:08,890 --> 02:36:12,490
we put the wheelchair
ramp up and we do those.

5009
02:36:12,520 --> 02:36:16,660
That's what we do and I'm
researching part of their life.

5010
02:36:16,661 --> 02:36:17,291
It's great.

5011
02:36:17,291 --> 02:36:18,310
That's hope it comes.

5012
02:36:18,850 --> 02:36:22,660
So we could close all these places
down and our close mine down first,

5013
02:36:23,560 --> 02:36:26,620
but right now they don't need research.

5014
02:36:26,621 --> 02:36:27,820
They need that.

5015
02:36:28,390 --> 02:36:33,390
They need help for their way of life
now for the quality of life for that kid

5016
02:36:33,820 --> 02:36:34,653
now.

5017
02:36:35,290 --> 02:36:36,280
So that's what we do.

5018
02:36:36,430 --> 02:36:38,440
How can someone donate to
this or if they want to,

5019
02:36:38,930 --> 02:36:40,360
it's the dark that was said.

5020
02:36:40,361 --> 02:36:43,690
I'm real bad on website
stuff on wake up caveman.

5021
02:36:43,690 --> 02:36:45,040
But it's the doctor.

There it is.

5034
02:37:03,860 --> 02:37:04,061

02:37:20,650 --> 02:37:21,470
Thank you.

5041
02:37:21,470 --> 02:37:21,651
Yeah,

5042
02:37:21,651 --> 02:37:23,360
this is a beautiful conversation man.

5043
02:37:23,361 --> 02:37:24,920
And know not just about boxing.

5044
02:37:25,520 --> 02:37:25,851
And,

5045
02:37:25,851 --> 02:37:26,684
uh,

5046
02:37:27,080 --> 02:37:29,180
I think this,

5047
02:37:29,181 --> 02:37:29,270
uh,

5048
02:37:29,270 --> 02:37:30,040
this,

5049
02:37:30,040 --> 02:37:30,770
like I said,

5050
02:37:30,770 --> 02:37:35,030
it speaks so much to who you are and why
you are who you are and why you won't

5051
02:37:35,031 --> 02:37:36,050
tolerate any bullshit.

5052
02:37:36,770 --> 02:37:37,131
Yeah.

5053
02:37:37,131 --> 02:37:39,320
It's like when you've
seen a guy like that,

5054
02:37:39,321 --> 02:37:40,190
it's Kinda like,

5055
02:37:41,390 --> 02:37:42,223
makes sense.

5056
02:37:42,470 --> 02:37:44,330
Are you still working with fighters?

5057
02:37:44,660 --> 02:37:45,051
You know,

5058
02:37:45,051 --> 02:37:45,620
it's funny.

5059
02:37:45,620 --> 02:37:46,100
Um,

5060
02:37:46,100 --> 02:37:49,870
no was the word and to a few
minutes ago to a few minutes ago,

5061
02:37:49,871 --> 02:37:50,210
well,

5062
02:37:50,210 --> 02:37:51,260
I'm saying a few minutes,

5063
02:37:51,261 --> 02:37:52,580
but until a week ago,

5064
02:37:52,790 --> 02:37:53,451
maybe less,

5065
02:37:53,451 --> 02:37:54,410
maybe five days ago,

5066
02:37:54,411 --> 02:37:54,780
I've,

5067
02:37:54,780 --> 02:37:56,600
I've decided to train a fighter.

5068
02:37:57,350 --> 02:38:00,890
He's going to fight for the world
light heavyweight title to sample first

5069
02:38:01,250 --> 02:38:03,410
against the second
hardest puncher in boxing,

5070
02:38:03,411 --> 02:38:04,220
unfortunately,

5071
02:38:04,220 --> 02:38:05,053
which he wasn't.

5072
02:38:05,360 --> 02:38:06,193
And um,

5073
02:38:06,440 --> 02:38:06,921
it's going to be,

5074
02:38:06,921 --> 02:38:08,240
I think it's on showtime,

5075
02:38:08,720 --> 02:38:09,291
I think.

5076
02:38:09,291 --> 02:38:11,470
I don't even know because I
didn't even find those details.

5077
02:38:11,471 --> 02:38:14,360
How when they asked me to train
them first I was saying no,

5078
02:38:14,900 --> 02:38:15,920
and then my kids said,

5079
02:38:16,760 --> 02:38:17,593
dad,

5080
02:38:17,600 --> 02:38:19,040
at least give it a chance.

5081
02:38:19,430 --> 02:38:22,760
So I flew out to where he is in Oxnard,

5082
02:38:22,761 --> 02:38:24,050
California to meet him.

5083
02:38:24,380 --> 02:38:26,360
His name is Alexander.

5084
02:38:26,510 --> 02:38:27,140
He's a,

5085
02:38:27,140 --> 02:38:30,470
he's a Ukrainian Alexander Volocyk.

5086
02:38:30,560 --> 02:38:33,890
I learned that you don't
pronounce the G it's voltage,

5087
02:38:33,920 --> 02:38:38,060
but it starts with a g he 15 and old 12
nine calories finding the second hardest

5088
02:38:38,061 --> 02:38:41,720
puncher in boxing donors to
Stevenson in Montreal way.

5089
02:38:43,460 --> 02:38:44,330
It's a tough fight.

5090
02:38:44,590 --> 02:38:45,423
Um,

5091
02:38:45,560 --> 02:38:47,300
they asked me if I would
train him at first,

5092
02:38:47,301 --> 02:38:47,781
like I said,

5093
02:38:47,781 --> 02:38:50,120
I would say no 20 things the
hardest punch your inbox.

5094
02:38:50,390 --> 02:38:51,223
Wilder,

5095
02:38:51,440 --> 02:38:52,273
wilder,

5096
02:38:52,700 --> 02:38:56,660
the old times would say he hit you on
top of the head and fractured ankles

5097
02:38:58,490 --> 02:38:59,323
that hard.

5098
02:39:00,650 --> 02:39:01,400
And um,

5099
02:39:01,400 --> 02:39:03,230
Donna Stevenson is a hell of a puncher,

5100
02:39:03,270 --> 02:39:06,620
is the second hardest puncher in
boxing lefthand southpaw on top of it.

5101
02:39:07,130 --> 02:39:07,963
And um,

5102
02:39:08,390 --> 02:39:10,180
when I flew out talks not to two nights,

5103
02:39:10,210 --> 02:39:13,040
if I'm going to say I'm
either going to say no,

5104
02:39:13,041 --> 02:39:14,660
which my kids asked me not to.

5105
02:39:14,960 --> 02:39:15,441
So I said,

5106
02:39:15,441 --> 02:39:19,260
then I'll get a fly out and I got to meet
him and when we had lunch with him and

5107
02:39:19,261 --> 02:39:20,094
the manager to,

5108
02:39:20,300 --> 02:39:21,050
you know,

5109
02:39:21,050 --> 02:39:21,720
anyway,

5110
02:39:21,720 --> 02:39:22,910
I'm sitting with them.

5111
02:39:22,911 --> 02:39:24,500
I don't know what they are for sure.

5112
02:39:24,590 --> 02:39:24,861
You know,

5113
02:39:24,861 --> 02:39:26,690
the manager I knew for
a while and a business,

5114
02:39:26,691 --> 02:39:28,520
but for sure you don't know to,

5115
02:39:28,521 --> 02:39:29,354
you know.

5116
02:39:29,360 --> 02:39:30,193
And um,

5117
02:39:30,350 --> 02:39:31,580
I wanted to try to find out.

5118
02:39:31,910 --> 02:39:34,010
So the thinking was like,

5119
02:39:34,580 --> 02:39:34,851
you know,

5120
02:39:34,851 --> 02:39:38,780
you're here to find out things probably
tomorrow in the gym and post we watch

5121
02:39:38,781 --> 02:39:39,590
tape.

5122
02:39:39,590 --> 02:39:40,700
So those are the things.

5123
02:39:40,701 --> 02:39:41,000
But,

5124
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:42,140
so I said to him right out,

5125
02:39:42,141 --> 02:39:42,411
I said,

5126
02:39:42,411 --> 02:39:43,150
well,

5127
02:39:43,150 --> 02:39:45,860
I'm here to see one thing first.

5128
02:39:47,540 --> 02:39:50,630
If you're a decent person and they will,

5129
02:39:50,631 --> 02:39:50,931
you know,

5130
02:39:50,931 --> 02:39:51,764
they were like,

5131
02:39:52,490 --> 02:39:53,323
that sounds,

5132
02:39:53,360 --> 02:39:53,631
you know,

5133
02:39:53,631 --> 02:39:54,350
maybe different,

5134
02:39:54,350 --> 02:39:54,621
you know,

5135
02:39:54,621 --> 02:39:55,840
because you know.

5136
02:39:55,880 --> 02:39:56,421
But I said,

5137
02:39:56,421 --> 02:39:59,720
I just want to have your decent perfect
cause I don't want to be around people.

5138
02:40:00,290 --> 02:40:03,260
I just want to be around and
there's bad people out there.

5139
02:40:03,320 --> 02:40:04,430
I'm sure it's the way it is,

5140
02:40:04,640 --> 02:40:07,610
but I don't want to be around bear people.

5141
02:40:08,030 --> 02:40:08,810
I never did,

5142
02:40:08,810 --> 02:40:10,520
but now I definitely don't.

5143
02:40:11,080 --> 02:40:11,840
I want to be,

5144
02:40:11,840 --> 02:40:13,220
if I'm going to spend two months,

5145
02:40:13,470 --> 02:40:15,060
it's not easy in camp.

5146
02:40:15,390 --> 02:40:16,470
I want to be around someone.

5147
02:40:16,471 --> 02:40:17,760
I feel good about being around.

5148
02:40:18,480 --> 02:40:21,150
And so that's the first thing.

5149
02:40:21,151 --> 02:40:22,830
The second thing is too,

5150
02:40:22,831 --> 02:40:23,790
I think I can help them.

5151
02:40:24,120 --> 02:40:25,140
That was the second thing.

5152
02:40:25,840 --> 02:40:26,673
Yeah.

5153
02:40:26,750 --> 02:40:27,900
And Kenny be helped.

5154
02:40:28,020 --> 02:40:30,540
So when you go to talk
to someone like that,

5155
02:40:30,541 --> 02:40:31,520
do you watch a move?

5156
02:40:31,530 --> 02:40:32,330
What you,

5157
02:40:32,330 --> 02:40:33,001
her family,

5158
02:40:33,001 --> 02:40:33,631
first thing I do,

5159
02:40:33,631 --> 02:40:35,310
I want to wind up meeting his family.

5160
02:40:35,311 --> 02:40:38,100
He's got three young
kids and he's a husband.

5161
02:40:38,101 --> 02:40:38,970
And of course,

5162
02:40:38,971 --> 02:40:41,550
and I see a decent person.

5163
02:40:42,540 --> 02:40:44,130
And then now my watch film.

5164
02:40:44,940 --> 02:40:45,773
And um,

5165
02:40:46,230 --> 02:40:50,750
I see a guy that has ideas
that need to be added to that.

5166
02:40:50,970 --> 02:40:51,930
I think that's the best word.

5167
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:52,800
Eyes.

5168
02:40:52,800 --> 02:40:55,110
They've got good ideas technically,

5169
02:40:55,440 --> 02:40:56,850
but they need to be advanced.

5170
02:40:57,210 --> 02:40:59,130
They need to be added to polished,

5171
02:40:59,131 --> 02:40:59,641
polished,

5172
02:40:59,641 --> 02:41:00,110
edited,

5173
02:41:00,110 --> 02:41:00,690
yes.

5174
02:41:00,690 --> 02:41:02,940
And taking down the road a little bit.

5175
02:41:03,420 --> 02:41:03,781
And,

5176
02:41:03,781 --> 02:41:04,614
um,

5177
02:41:05,280 --> 02:41:07,050
I see a guy who behaves like a fighter.

5178
02:41:07,620 --> 02:41:09,270
That's where it starts for me.

5179
02:41:09,510 --> 02:41:10,830
Besides being a decent person.

5180
02:41:11,130 --> 02:41:12,200
He behaves like a fighter.

5181
02:41:12,210 --> 02:41:13,043
He got hurt.

5182
02:41:13,110 --> 02:41:15,180
He got dropped in a fiery
behave like a fighter.

5183
02:41:15,960 --> 02:41:18,240
You have to be able to a
fighter to be a fighter,

5184
02:41:18,241 --> 02:41:19,530
you have to be a fighter.

5185
02:41:19,640 --> 02:41:20,220
Right.

5186
02:41:20,220 --> 02:41:20,611
And,

5187
02:41:20,611 --> 02:41:21,444
um,

5188
02:41:21,660 --> 02:41:22,950
well you would know that better than most.

5189
02:41:22,951 --> 02:41:24,480
So He um,

5190
02:41:26,860 --> 02:41:27,261
and,

5191
02:41:27,261 --> 02:41:28,830
and there's one problem.

5192
02:41:29,850 --> 02:41:32,580
Every fight he gets hit at
least once really clean.

5193
02:41:32,730 --> 02:41:34,140
You can't do that with this guy.

5194
02:41:34,290 --> 02:41:34,980
Right.

5195
02:41:34,980 --> 02:41:36,090
He gets it more than once,

5196
02:41:36,240 --> 02:41:37,320
but he gets it clean.

5197
02:41:37,920 --> 02:41:38,700
You know,

5198
02:41:38,700 --> 02:41:42,660
I one time I to to fight him when I
was trying to Bradley actually was,

5199
02:41:42,960 --> 02:41:43,530
I said,

5200
02:41:43,530 --> 02:41:44,550
you religious.

5201
02:41:44,580 --> 02:41:45,120
Yeah,

5202
02:41:45,120 --> 02:41:45,571
I am.

5203
02:41:45,571 --> 02:41:46,291
And my own way.

5204
02:41:46,291 --> 02:41:46,591
I said,

5205
02:41:46,591 --> 02:41:46,921
listen,

5206
02:41:46,921 --> 02:41:47,790
I'm not into that.

5207
02:41:47,820 --> 02:41:50,220
I'm say I'm just using it as an example,

5208
02:41:50,400 --> 02:41:51,233
my way of saying,

5209
02:41:51,420 --> 02:41:52,800
I said I was brought up a Catholic,

5210
02:41:52,801 --> 02:41:54,600
I forget half the things they told me,

5211
02:41:54,930 --> 02:41:58,020
but I remember about,

5212
02:41:58,021 --> 02:41:59,280
they used to teach you've,

5213
02:41:59,710 --> 02:42:02,010
I'm probably pronouncing her what
I'm going to need your help again.

5214
02:42:02,190 --> 02:42:07,190
But venial sins and mortal since the renew
or the little ones you can live with,

5215
02:42:07,561 --> 02:42:10,650
you don't go and see the guy
that's read the moral ones.

5216
02:42:10,651 --> 02:42:11,484
You've got a problem.

5217
02:42:12,240 --> 02:42:12,990
I said,

5218
02:42:12,990 --> 02:42:15,110
the way you box you've,

5219
02:42:15,620 --> 02:42:19,950
you make it moral sense it
the venial sins domain crap.

5220
02:42:20,140 --> 02:42:20,370
Right?

5221
02:42:20,370 --> 02:42:22,680
But you make it more once
you get in the hit clean,

5222
02:42:23,480 --> 02:42:24,313
unblocked,

5223
02:42:25,110 --> 02:42:25,980
clean,

5224
02:42:26,010 --> 02:42:29,930
solid punches that sometimes you don't
even see like the providing the crop by.

5225
02:42:29,960 --> 02:42:30,390
Yes,

5226
02:42:30,390 --> 02:42:30,900
yes,

5227
02:42:30,900 --> 02:42:31,231
yes,

5228
02:42:31,231 --> 02:42:31,920
yes.

5229
02:42:31,920 --> 02:42:33,810
So I said that's going to be corrected,

5230
02:42:33,870 --> 02:42:34,410
right?

5231
02:42:34,410 --> 02:42:35,380
So we corrected it.

5232
02:42:35,490 --> 02:42:37,110
So how do you correct something like that.

5233
02:42:37,200 --> 02:42:38,160
You know what it is,

5234
02:42:38,300 --> 02:42:38,760
right?

5235
02:42:38,760 --> 02:42:39,720
You have to know what it is.

5236
02:42:39,721 --> 02:42:43,510
You have to see why he's getting hit
change and you've got to change the

5237
02:42:43,511 --> 02:42:46,740
technique of way everything.

5238
02:42:46,920 --> 02:42:47,730
There's rules.

5239
02:42:47,730 --> 02:42:49,110
You got to it's life.

5240
02:42:49,170 --> 02:42:50,280
It's when you work with the garlic,

5241
02:42:50,310 --> 02:42:51,510
then you only have two months.

5242
02:42:51,540 --> 02:42:53,240
How much change can
you affect in too much?

5243
02:42:53,280 --> 02:42:53,550
Well,

5244
02:42:53,550 --> 02:42:58,230
I worked with Bradley for the right wheels
fight and he and he couldn't stand in

5245
02:42:58,231 --> 02:43:01,170
front of the guy and he went out and
he moved around the guy and you know we

5246
02:43:01,171 --> 02:43:01,351
were,

5247
02:43:01,351 --> 02:43:02,250
we were fortunate.

5248
02:43:02,730 --> 02:43:03,563
We did okay.

5249
02:43:03,630 --> 02:43:04,500
We made some change.

5250
02:43:05,280 --> 02:43:07,410
But I mean a little things like,

5251
02:43:07,411 --> 02:43:08,250
I'll give you an example.

5252
02:43:08,270 --> 02:43:09,001
[inaudible] rules,

5253
02:43:09,001 --> 02:43:09,421
rules,

5254
02:43:09,421 --> 02:43:09,751
rules,

5255
02:43:09,751 --> 02:43:11,910
simple things like where
are you at 12 punch from?

5256
02:43:11,940 --> 02:43:12,220
I

5257
02:43:12,220 --> 02:43:14,200
know I just got here.

5258
02:43:14,270 --> 02:43:14,771
I told her,

5259
02:43:14,771 --> 02:43:15,604
No,

5260
02:43:15,970 --> 02:43:18,430
don't throw jab from there
because if you're too close,

5261
02:43:18,431 --> 02:43:19,990
he could time you were right in and we,

5262
02:43:20,010 --> 02:43:21,880
everyone heard jabbers
to beginning of things.

5263
02:43:21,881 --> 02:43:23,150
Jeff has to the,

5264
02:43:23,160 --> 02:43:23,740
you know,

5265
02:43:23,740 --> 02:43:24,910
it leads to good things.

5266
02:43:25,030 --> 02:43:25,870
It's a great point.

5267
02:43:25,900 --> 02:43:26,111
Yeah,

5268
02:43:26,111 --> 02:43:26,680
it is.

5269
02:43:26,680 --> 02:43:30,250
It's a terrible ponch and so it's
a horrible punch of your throat.

5270
02:43:30,251 --> 02:43:32,530
The wrong distance you drove
from a little too close.

5271
02:43:32,531 --> 02:43:33,040
Bang.

5272
02:43:33,040 --> 02:43:33,411
You get her.

5273
02:43:33,411 --> 02:43:35,530
We're right in no way.

5274
02:43:35,650 --> 02:43:38,350
You throw punches from love
talking to all of level.

5275
02:43:38,351 --> 02:43:38,741
He got here,

5276
02:43:38,741 --> 02:43:40,570
we're right here and we'll
provide the god he didn't.

5277
02:43:40,660 --> 02:43:42,010
All he knew was he got hit,

5278
02:43:42,250 --> 02:43:44,550
but he didn't know why you threw the lab.

5279
02:43:44,551 --> 02:43:45,384
Took in front,

5280
02:43:45,520 --> 02:43:46,600
right hand is there.

5281
02:43:46,690 --> 02:43:47,523
Boom.

5282
02:43:47,710 --> 02:43:48,910
Get on his side.

5283
02:43:49,030 --> 02:43:51,220
Troll punches from certain positions,

5284
02:43:51,400 --> 02:43:54,220
not allowed to draw punches are less.

5285
02:43:54,221 --> 02:43:55,990
They're from the right position

5286
02:43:57,680 --> 02:43:58,513
now you have to,

5287
02:43:58,970 --> 02:44:01,640
cos would tell me you have to

5288
02:44:01,980 --> 02:44:06,700
co over and over and over and over word

5289
02:44:06,720 --> 02:44:09,840
again til they can't do it
wrong if they want it to.

5290
02:44:11,050 --> 02:44:11,970
It's got to become a habit.

5291
02:44:12,110 --> 02:44:12,270
Right,

5292
02:44:12,270 --> 02:44:14,460
but you're not thinking
about it where it's a habit.

5293
02:44:14,670 --> 02:44:18,150
And that takes a lot of work and that
takes understanding what it is and it

5294
02:44:18,151 --> 02:44:18,841
takes a lot of work.

5295
02:44:18,841 --> 02:44:19,860
You've got to be on him every time.

5296
02:44:19,920 --> 02:44:21,060
And it takes a guy,

5297
02:44:21,390 --> 02:44:23,070
they can put his ego in a pocket.

5298
02:44:23,490 --> 02:44:24,241
It's why you want to know,

5299
02:44:24,241 --> 02:44:25,290
do I have a good guy here?

5300
02:44:25,560 --> 02:44:26,490
Do I have a decent guy?

5301
02:44:26,880 --> 02:44:30,090
Because you're telling a guy who's
already made it to a certain level without

5302
02:44:30,091 --> 02:44:30,510
you.

5303
02:44:30,510 --> 02:44:31,343
He has,

5304
02:44:32,430 --> 02:44:35,370
and now you're telling them
this things that he don't know.

5305
02:44:36,240 --> 02:44:39,120
So he's got to be willing
to be able to accept that.

5306
02:44:40,110 --> 02:44:40,943
And I'm

5307
02:44:42,480 --> 02:44:46,110
one of the things I like people
that are unselfish and local,

5308
02:44:46,111 --> 02:44:47,580
all selfish to a certain degree.

5309
02:44:47,850 --> 02:44:48,301
But again,

5310
02:44:48,301 --> 02:44:48,901
it's degrees.

5311
02:44:48,901 --> 02:44:50,370
How tough are your degrees?

5312
02:44:50,850 --> 02:44:52,500
All fighters are tough degrees.

5313
02:44:52,501 --> 02:44:53,190
How does,

5314
02:44:53,190 --> 02:44:54,930
how selfish are your degrees?

5315
02:44:55,120 --> 02:44:55,953
Right.

5316
02:44:56,010 --> 02:44:59,110
And I,

5317
02:44:59,730 --> 02:45:02,700
the whole understanding was I
would go to Oxnard for eight weeks,

5318
02:45:02,701 --> 02:45:03,330
you know,

5319
02:45:03,330 --> 02:45:04,163
to train them,

5320
02:45:04,650 --> 02:45:06,450
but maybe I don't want to go to oxide,

5321
02:45:07,050 --> 02:45:10,080
but I'll go wherever I
take it gives to fight it.

5322
02:45:10,081 --> 02:45:12,690
The best chance to win the weather,

5323
02:45:13,410 --> 02:45:14,290
the time zone.

5324
02:45:14,790 --> 02:45:16,800
But the main thing why I go there,

5325
02:45:17,700 --> 02:45:18,930
he's got three young kids.

5326
02:45:19,890 --> 02:45:21,420
I'm not in a rocky movie.

5327
02:45:22,270 --> 02:45:26,520
I don't want to take them away from
those kids for those eight weeks.

5328
02:45:26,690 --> 02:45:27,120
Right.

5329
02:45:27,120 --> 02:45:27,953
That's not good.

5330
02:45:28,230 --> 02:45:29,460
So how many,

5331
02:45:29,640 --> 02:45:31,900
so I took two weeks to decide to them.

5332
02:45:31,980 --> 02:45:33,330
He kept calling to manage up.

5333
02:45:33,990 --> 02:45:34,823
He's a good kid.

5334
02:45:36,120 --> 02:45:36,953
He is.

5335
02:45:37,320 --> 02:45:38,110
And he kept calling him,

5336
02:45:38,110 --> 02:45:38,950
manage up and saying,

5337
02:45:38,951 --> 02:45:39,784
did you hear yet?

5338
02:45:40,620 --> 02:45:42,150
And of course he had,

5339
02:45:42,660 --> 02:45:45,560
so he's thinking like
a good person or like,

5340
02:45:45,840 --> 02:45:46,800
I shouldn't say good part.

5341
02:45:46,800 --> 02:45:48,990
He's taking like a person that
wants to get what he wants to get,

5342
02:45:49,140 --> 02:45:50,400
but at the same time,

5343
02:45:50,940 --> 02:45:53,730
here's where the good part
comes in or the self less pot.

5344
02:45:54,660 --> 02:45:55,493
He says,

5345
02:45:56,760 --> 02:45:57,990
if I have to go to New York,

5346
02:45:58,020 --> 02:45:59,010
I'll go to New York.

5347
02:45:59,700 --> 02:46:00,960
A lot of fighters don't do that.

5348
02:46:01,350 --> 02:46:02,071
They want help,

5349
02:46:02,071 --> 02:46:03,330
but they want it on their terms.

5350
02:46:03,390 --> 02:46:04,200
Right.

5351
02:46:04,200 --> 02:46:04,501
He said,

5352
02:46:04,501 --> 02:46:05,550
if I have to go to New York,

5353
02:46:05,551 --> 02:46:06,370
I go to New York.

5354
02:46:06,370 --> 02:46:08,130
I have to go to Montreal
called the Montreal.

5355
02:46:08,131 --> 02:46:09,060
Please tell them that,

5356
02:46:09,590 --> 02:46:11,270
that that spoke to me,

5357
02:46:12,170 --> 02:46:15,260
that I had this kid that selfless too.

5358
02:46:15,261 --> 02:46:17,690
To that extent and I could
see was training him before.

5359
02:46:17,770 --> 02:46:18,500
Um,

5360
02:46:18,500 --> 02:46:19,400
I don't know the name,

5361
02:46:19,430 --> 02:46:20,390
but it was uh,

5362
02:46:21,350 --> 02:46:21,750
you know,

5363
02:46:21,750 --> 02:46:22,820
were decent.

5364
02:46:22,900 --> 02:46:23,810
He's 15 at all.

5365
02:46:24,460 --> 02:46:24,890
But uh,

5366
02:46:24,890 --> 02:46:27,380
but he felt like when,

5367
02:46:27,860 --> 02:46:28,640
you know,

5368
02:46:28,640 --> 02:46:32,930
when he got dropped in a fight and we
went back to the gym immediately that

5369
02:46:33,080 --> 02:46:34,520
should be dealt with,

5370
02:46:34,550 --> 02:46:35,383
you know,

5371
02:46:35,710 --> 02:46:37,790
but it was back to just basic training.

5372
02:46:37,790 --> 02:46:39,560
I can rather than that specific,

5373
02:46:39,830 --> 02:46:40,500
you know,

5374
02:46:40,500 --> 02:46:42,080
it doesn't mean that the guy's not good.

5375
02:46:42,081 --> 02:46:44,230
Doesn't mean it just that he,

5376
02:46:45,440 --> 02:46:46,550
everyone deals with things.

5377
02:46:46,551 --> 02:46:47,000
Definitely.

5378
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:47,600
That's all.

5379
02:46:47,600 --> 02:46:49,310
I mean it doesn't make me this or that,

5380
02:46:49,580 --> 02:46:52,040
but I just can do it the way I do it.

5381
02:46:52,190 --> 02:46:53,090
And I do it.

5382
02:46:53,091 --> 02:46:53,811
I look at film,

5383
02:46:53,811 --> 02:46:54,740
when I went to see him,

5384
02:46:54,741 --> 02:46:59,210
I had a couple of pages
written out already on things
I saw on film that he does

5385
02:46:59,211 --> 02:47:01,580
wrong that daddy would have to correct.

5386
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:06,260
And the one thing that he has to correct
for this fight will be good if you

5387
02:47:06,261 --> 02:47:06,771
don't get hit,

5388
02:47:06,771 --> 02:47:08,150
I mean that'd be a damn good thing.

5389
02:47:08,450 --> 02:47:13,450
But the one really thing is you can't
keep coming back in front of the guy at a

5390
02:47:13,581 --> 02:47:16,520
certain distance and given them a shot
at your winning components like that.

5391
02:47:16,880 --> 02:47:17,720
And that's one thing.

5392
02:47:17,870 --> 02:47:22,870
He always winds up localized
right back in front of the guy.

5393
02:47:23,180 --> 02:47:25,460
And there's gotta be other options,

5394
02:47:26,030 --> 02:47:27,230
other places to go.

5395
02:47:28,160 --> 02:47:28,993
You know,

5396
02:47:29,060 --> 02:47:29,871
I joke around,

5397
02:47:29,871 --> 02:47:31,250
I used to fund,

5398
02:47:31,630 --> 02:47:32,001
you know,

5399
02:47:32,001 --> 02:47:34,370
different examples of different analogies.

5400
02:47:34,371 --> 02:47:34,701
I say,

5401
02:47:34,701 --> 02:47:35,534
listen,

5402
02:47:35,780 --> 02:47:39,530
whether you had a mother or grandmother
and had somebody when you were growing

5403
02:47:39,531 --> 02:47:41,240
up told you don't hang out on the corner.

5404
02:47:44,410 --> 02:47:44,870
Right,

5405
02:47:44,870 --> 02:47:45,230
right.

5406
02:47:45,230 --> 02:47:45,620
Yeah.

5407
02:47:45,620 --> 02:47:46,280
Why?

5408
02:47:46,280 --> 02:47:47,750
Because nothing good can happen.

5409
02:47:48,860 --> 02:47:49,011
Well,

5410
02:47:49,011 --> 02:47:50,510
don't hang out in front of the guy.

5411
02:47:50,890 --> 02:47:52,580
Nothing good can happen or can happen.

5412
02:47:52,670 --> 02:47:53,990
So we go from there.

5413
02:47:54,080 --> 02:47:54,321
You know,

5414
02:47:54,321 --> 02:47:55,320
it's a lot more to it.

5415
02:47:55,820 --> 02:47:56,031
Yeah,

5416
02:47:56,031 --> 02:47:56,481
he does.

5417
02:47:56,481 --> 02:47:57,201
He's a smart guy.

5418
02:47:57,201 --> 02:47:58,310
He's got beautiful family.

5419
02:47:58,311 --> 02:47:59,720
And like I said,

5420
02:47:59,721 --> 02:48:00,510
it's a,

5421
02:48:00,510 --> 02:48:00,740
I'm,

5422
02:48:00,740 --> 02:48:01,521
so when do you start,

5423
02:48:01,521 --> 02:48:02,820
because December 1st is,

5424
02:48:02,980 --> 02:48:04,670
you said the referral sources to fight.

5425
02:48:04,671 --> 02:48:05,900
I have to make a decision.

5426
02:48:06,290 --> 02:48:06,980
I have to,

5427
02:48:06,980 --> 02:48:09,560
it's either going to be an
eight or a seven week camp.

5428
02:48:10,010 --> 02:48:10,620
Uh,

5429
02:48:10,620 --> 02:48:11,180
I,

5430
02:48:11,180 --> 02:48:12,170
I'm trying to feel,

5431
02:48:12,171 --> 02:48:14,180
I'm trying to find out
by asking them questions,

5432
02:48:14,510 --> 02:48:18,650
how quickly his body gets in shape because
I know it sounds funny to the average

5433
02:48:18,651 --> 02:48:19,221
guy out there,

5434
02:48:19,221 --> 02:48:21,650
but if it's a week too
long it could be bad.

5435
02:48:21,680 --> 02:48:22,513
Yeah.

5436
02:48:23,030 --> 02:48:23,490
You know?

5437
02:48:23,490 --> 02:48:23,900
Yeah.

5438
02:48:23,900 --> 02:48:24,733
So,

5439
02:48:24,980 --> 02:48:26,480
and he's overtrained in his career.

5440
02:48:26,720 --> 02:48:29,420
So I wanted Friday try.

5441
02:48:29,630 --> 02:48:33,860
It's not an exact science to have
a feel for be to seven weeks.

5442
02:48:33,890 --> 02:48:35,780
Did you monitor their heart rate?

5443
02:48:35,781 --> 02:48:37,490
The resting I have.

5444
02:48:37,520 --> 02:48:40,460
So we have that stuff that we do that um,

5445
02:48:40,520 --> 02:48:43,010
to see if there were 10 of pain
when they wake up in the yes.

5446
02:48:43,100 --> 02:48:43,611
But you know what?

5447
02:48:43,611 --> 02:48:44,590
I depend on B.

5448
02:48:44,600 --> 02:48:47,380
I'm not going to stay and be asked your,

5449
02:48:47,990 --> 02:48:51,620
I depend on my eye more
than any three cm song down.

5450
02:48:52,070 --> 02:48:54,710
He seemed struggle and the
trick is to not get there,

5451
02:48:55,100 --> 02:48:56,430
to try not to get there.

5452
02:48:57,440 --> 02:48:57,951
What are you doing?

5453
02:48:57,951 --> 02:48:58,970
You tell them to take a few days,

5454
02:48:59,270 --> 02:49:01,610
but I try to see it before I see what,

5455
02:49:01,710 --> 02:49:04,910
what I mean is if he had
a hard day of training,

5456
02:49:05,400 --> 02:49:08,240
I will just automatically
give him a light day or maybe

5457
02:49:08,250 --> 02:49:09,050
off the next day.

5458
02:49:09,050 --> 02:49:09,360
Right.

5459
02:49:09,360 --> 02:49:12,540
And like a lot of people won't because
they're afraid like you got to work,

5460
02:49:12,570 --> 02:49:13,141
got to work.

5461
02:49:13,141 --> 02:49:13,610
Right.

5462
02:49:13,610 --> 02:49:14,260
And,

5463
02:49:14,260 --> 02:49:15,960
but I learned not to be afraid of that.

5464
02:49:16,070 --> 02:49:16,510
Right.

5465
02:49:16,510 --> 02:49:16,920
So,

5466
02:49:16,920 --> 02:49:19,530
so if I see he had a
real and he looked great,

5467
02:49:20,160 --> 02:49:20,680
you know what,

5468
02:49:20,680 --> 02:49:25,110
take off to wall or you sure take
off tomorrow so we don't get there.

5469
02:49:25,140 --> 02:49:25,800
Right.

5470
02:49:25,800 --> 02:49:28,560
To try to kind of like my father,

5471
02:49:28,561 --> 02:49:29,560
like preventative meant,

5472
02:49:30,020 --> 02:49:31,890
I said this is a new
way of thinking though.

5473
02:49:31,891 --> 02:49:34,770
And it's such a smart way of thinking
because for the longest time everybody

5474
02:49:34,771 --> 02:49:35,760
just wanted to be tough.

5475
02:49:35,880 --> 02:49:36,330
Yeah.

5476
02:49:36,330 --> 02:49:37,470
They just wanted to work harder.

5477
02:49:37,471 --> 02:49:38,550
But you got to work smarter.

5478
02:49:38,610 --> 02:49:38,761
Yeah.

5479
02:49:38,761 --> 02:49:39,594
You do.

5480
02:49:39,690 --> 02:49:40,410
Less is more,

5481
02:49:40,410 --> 02:49:41,243
you know that saying,

5482
02:49:41,320 --> 02:49:42,001
but sometimes,

5483
02:49:42,001 --> 02:49:43,750
but it really is sometimes sometimes,

5484
02:49:43,800 --> 02:49:46,830
but sometimes not because some people
are fucking lazy and they're looking for

5485
02:49:46,831 --> 02:49:47,670
that easy way out.

5486
02:49:47,760 --> 02:49:49,590
You have to gauge that Jack to see it.

5487
02:49:49,591 --> 02:49:50,610
You have to know what you got to,

5488
02:49:50,790 --> 02:49:51,331
you know what I mean?

5489
02:49:51,331 --> 02:49:54,810
And sometimes the real discipline driven
guys are their own worst enemy in that

5490
02:49:54,811 --> 02:49:55,230
regard.

5491
02:49:55,230 --> 02:49:56,430
That has pushed too far.

5492
02:49:56,520 --> 02:49:56,970
Yes.

5493
02:49:56,970 --> 02:49:57,990
And this kid has been,

5494
02:49:58,200 --> 02:49:58,531
again,

5495
02:49:58,531 --> 02:49:59,940
I'm not here to say what was,

5496
02:50:00,150 --> 02:50:03,750
but the kid has been in that place
and that's why they're coming to me.

5497
02:50:03,751 --> 02:50:04,670
And again,

5498
02:50:04,770 --> 02:50:06,000
I'm no better than anyone,

5499
02:50:06,360 --> 02:50:09,150
but I will understand that.

5500
02:50:09,210 --> 02:50:10,050
So when you were,

5501
02:50:10,110 --> 02:50:11,760
when you were saying seven
weeks or eight weeks,

5502
02:50:11,761 --> 02:50:12,594
so either one,

5503
02:50:13,270 --> 02:50:14,340
it's either going to be,

5504
02:50:14,580 --> 02:50:17,070
so my first day it's going to be a Monday.

5505
02:50:17,220 --> 02:50:22,220
So the first day in camp in Oxnard will
either be October 8th or October 15th,

5506
02:50:23,040 --> 02:50:23,730
October 8th,

5507
02:50:23,730 --> 02:50:24,900
we represent eight weeks.

5508
02:50:24,901 --> 02:50:25,740
October 15,

5509
02:50:25,741 --> 02:50:26,574
seven weeks.

5510
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:29,880
And that would mean I
would fly in on a Saturday,

5511
02:50:30,030 --> 02:50:31,860
get myself settled Sunday,

5512
02:50:31,861 --> 02:50:32,940
watch tape with him,

5513
02:50:33,780 --> 02:50:34,613
um,

5514
02:50:34,860 --> 02:50:35,430
uh,

5515
02:50:35,430 --> 02:50:38,310
and then start Monday with
a structured schedule,

5516
02:50:38,810 --> 02:50:39,643
you know,

5517
02:50:40,260 --> 02:50:42,140
with the ability to change it anytime.

5518
02:50:42,150 --> 02:50:43,140
Because again,

5519
02:50:43,250 --> 02:50:43,710
Ui,

5520
02:50:43,710 --> 02:50:44,161
you see?

5521
02:50:44,161 --> 02:50:44,700
Right.

5522
02:50:44,700 --> 02:50:45,533
You know,

5523
02:50:45,810 --> 02:50:47,610
I remember years ago I
was training fighters.

5524
02:50:47,611 --> 02:50:47,851
You know,

5525
02:50:47,851 --> 02:50:49,170
I've been around 40 years already.

5526
02:50:49,590 --> 02:50:52,340
I remember been Gleason's when
I moved down to Gleason's,

5527
02:50:52,341 --> 02:50:53,070
you know,

5528
02:50:53,070 --> 02:50:53,903
many years ago,

5529
02:50:54,180 --> 02:50:54,571
30,

5530
02:50:54,571 --> 02:50:55,404
whatever it was,

5531
02:50:55,590 --> 02:50:57,510
maybe more 35.

5532
02:50:58,230 --> 02:50:59,063
Um,

5533
02:50:59,370 --> 02:51:00,690
so Gleason's was in Manhattan,

5534
02:51:00,691 --> 02:51:01,600
it's in Brooklyn output.

5535
02:51:01,620 --> 02:51:02,371
It was a man,

5536
02:51:02,371 --> 02:51:03,360
it was the place,

5537
02:51:03,361 --> 02:51:03,900
you know,

5538
02:51:03,900 --> 02:51:05,550
and it was two blocks from
Madison Square Garden.

5539
02:51:05,610 --> 02:51:06,330
It was kind of cool,

5540
02:51:06,330 --> 02:51:06,930
you know.

5541
02:51:06,930 --> 02:51:07,763
So,

5542
02:51:08,110 --> 02:51:08,540
um,

5543
02:51:08,540 --> 02:51:12,870
I'm trying to find it and I remember I
was the first guy there and not bragging

5544
02:51:12,871 --> 02:51:13,290
or not,

5545
02:51:13,290 --> 02:51:15,000
but I mean you just,

5546
02:51:15,160 --> 02:51:18,630
I w I would make my guys drink
water and he old time guys,

5547
02:51:18,640 --> 02:51:19,590
10 guys,

5548
02:51:19,770 --> 02:51:23,370
not because they knew it from scientific
evidence to say other than it was

5549
02:51:23,371 --> 02:51:24,300
passed down to them.

5550
02:51:24,720 --> 02:51:25,590
It was taboo.

5551
02:51:25,740 --> 02:51:27,960
It was just passed down
to the tall drink water.

5552
02:51:28,680 --> 02:51:29,700
It makes you weak,

5553
02:51:30,210 --> 02:51:30,541
you know,

5554
02:51:30,541 --> 02:51:31,171
you've got to be tough.

5555
02:51:31,171 --> 02:51:31,800
Don't drink wine.

5556
02:51:31,800 --> 02:51:34,380
So I was making my guys
not only drink water,

5557
02:51:34,381 --> 02:51:35,430
drink a half a gallon,

5558
02:51:35,640 --> 02:51:36,780
I mean drink a lot of water.

5559
02:51:36,930 --> 02:51:38,820
So I remember some of the old timers,

5560
02:51:38,821 --> 02:51:40,350
would they be like talking about me?

5561
02:51:40,351 --> 02:51:41,184
They'd be like,

5562
02:51:41,660 --> 02:51:42,493
it's a fixed this guy.

5563
02:51:43,470 --> 02:51:47,220
Don't drink or don't follow what he's
doing because some of the fighters who was

5564
02:51:47,221 --> 02:51:50,410
psychiatry and some water
and get that water and,

5565
02:51:50,420 --> 02:51:50,820
and,

5566
02:51:50,820 --> 02:51:51,750
and know what it gives you,

5567
02:51:51,751 --> 02:51:52,584
cramps.

5568
02:51:52,650 --> 02:51:53,160
It'll make you a,

5569
02:51:53,160 --> 02:51:56,320
you now don't give you cramps
if you drink a large amount.

5570
02:51:56,340 --> 02:51:57,450
Very cold and yeah,

5571
02:51:57,650 --> 02:51:57,921
yeah,

5572
02:51:57,921 --> 02:51:58,131
yeah.

5573
02:51:58,131 --> 02:51:58,740
You could go.

5574
02:51:58,740 --> 02:52:00,900
But now if we hydrates you,

5575
02:52:01,170 --> 02:52:02,640
it allows you to stay strong.

5576
02:52:03,300 --> 02:52:06,070
Try to drive a car because the
desert with no water in the radiator,

5577
02:52:06,250 --> 02:52:07,330
you might have a problem.

5578
02:52:08,770 --> 02:52:09,790
You might and,

5579
02:52:09,910 --> 02:52:10,271
and,

5580
02:52:10,271 --> 02:52:10,810
and,

5581
02:52:10,810 --> 02:52:12,490
but I'm telling you and I'm not,

5582
02:52:12,491 --> 02:52:13,570
so I was afraid.

5583
02:52:13,630 --> 02:52:13,901
No,

5584
02:52:13,901 --> 02:52:15,640
but I'm saying that that place,

5585
02:52:16,180 --> 02:52:18,430
the thing was nobody drank water,

5586
02:52:18,431 --> 02:52:19,264
spit it out.

5587
02:52:19,370 --> 02:52:19,780
Right.

5588
02:52:19,780 --> 02:52:22,580
And I was making my guys drink
and right in front of me.

5589
02:52:22,700 --> 02:52:23,291
Do you know though,

5590
02:52:23,291 --> 02:52:24,250
what was the difference?

5591
02:52:28,120 --> 02:52:29,170
I knew by learning.

5592
02:52:29,380 --> 02:52:31,630
I knew my father,

5593
02:52:32,170 --> 02:52:32,831
my father,

5594
02:52:32,831 --> 02:52:33,664
um,

5595
02:52:34,240 --> 02:52:36,220
talked about the importance of water.

5596
02:52:37,180 --> 02:52:37,610
You know,

5597
02:52:37,610 --> 02:52:38,411
he was proud.

5598
02:52:38,411 --> 02:52:39,244
I was training.

5599
02:52:39,520 --> 02:52:41,050
He thought it was going to be a lawyer.

5600
02:52:42,140 --> 02:52:43,630
He went a little different,

5601
02:52:43,990 --> 02:52:45,010
but a,

5602
02:52:45,100 --> 02:52:46,400
he was proud that a it.

5603
02:52:46,401 --> 02:52:47,770
So he would talk to me like,

5604
02:52:47,771 --> 02:52:48,521
he was like,

5605
02:52:48,521 --> 02:52:50,150
I just got a two osmosis,

5606
02:52:50,230 --> 02:52:51,041
if that makes sense.

5607
02:52:51,041 --> 02:52:51,874
I just,

5608
02:52:52,060 --> 02:52:52,780
I knew,

5609
02:52:52,780 --> 02:52:54,100
I knew water was healthy.

5610
02:52:54,130 --> 02:52:58,060
I knew it was important that you had to
rehydrate yourself and yet you had to,

5611
02:52:58,390 --> 02:53:02,590
my father had a thing with water to my
father would make my father got involved

5612
02:53:02,591 --> 02:53:03,970
in my training in different ways.

5613
02:53:04,240 --> 02:53:05,080
Like if my fight,

5614
02:53:05,081 --> 02:53:10,081
it was feeling a little weak or he had
a cut and he was healing from the cut by

5615
02:53:10,091 --> 02:53:12,730
father would say set
them down in the ocean.

5616
02:53:13,090 --> 02:53:14,800
Why Dad?

5617
02:53:14,801 --> 02:53:15,700
We're not taking a vacate.

5618
02:53:15,940 --> 02:53:17,560
Pardon me in the ocean.

5619
02:53:18,580 --> 02:53:19,200
I said,

5620
02:53:19,200 --> 02:53:20,033
all right.

5621
02:53:20,110 --> 02:53:20,920
Okay.

5622
02:53:20,920 --> 02:53:22,210
Let them go in the ocean,

5623
02:53:22,270 --> 02:53:22,910
let them soak,

5624
02:53:22,910 --> 02:53:24,150
cause his scar,

5625
02:53:24,160 --> 02:53:25,210
whatever you know is called,

5626
02:53:25,390 --> 02:53:28,170
let them soak it in the ocean and uh,

5627
02:53:28,210 --> 02:53:30,490
don't go to clay out and
thought that might not be good,

5628
02:53:32,410 --> 02:53:33,530
but I won't work.

5629
02:53:33,580 --> 02:53:37,690
Now that might not heal you
but change it might change.

5630
02:53:37,691 --> 02:53:38,980
It might be green when you come out,

5631
02:53:40,170 --> 02:53:42,070
you got something going on with the hulk.

5632
02:53:42,340 --> 02:53:42,641
But,

5633
02:53:42,641 --> 02:53:43,390
um,

5634
02:53:43,390 --> 02:53:43,601
no,

5635
02:53:43,601 --> 02:53:44,710
but so no.

5636
02:53:44,711 --> 02:53:46,710
He would tell me in a
series where he said 30,

5637
02:53:47,260 --> 02:53:48,093
um,

5638
02:53:48,370 --> 02:53:49,390
send you fighter.

5639
02:53:49,870 --> 02:53:50,710
If he's a little,

5640
02:53:51,150 --> 02:53:53,050
he needs to be revitalized a little,

5641
02:53:53,110 --> 02:53:55,320
set them to the ocean
that was swimming ocean,

5642
02:53:55,321 --> 02:53:57,230
let them be in the sun and uh,

5643
02:53:57,310 --> 02:53:58,560
let them so whatever,

5644
02:53:58,570 --> 02:54:00,250
concealing the notion and,

5645
02:54:00,340 --> 02:54:03,040
and if he happens to swallow some water,

5646
02:54:03,160 --> 02:54:05,940
it's okay because I have no
one wanted to swallow seawater.

5647
02:54:05,960 --> 02:54:06,180
Right.

5648
02:54:06,180 --> 02:54:07,210
And the worst thing in the world,

5649
02:54:07,450 --> 02:54:08,170
my father said,

5650
02:54:08,170 --> 02:54:09,003
it's okay,

5651
02:54:09,070 --> 02:54:09,903
not the worst thing.

5652
02:54:09,940 --> 02:54:10,780
So one day,

5653
02:54:10,781 --> 02:54:15,781
I guess I got around to asking him why
he was so into sending my fighters to the

5654
02:54:16,541 --> 02:54:17,290
ocean.

5655
02:54:17,290 --> 02:54:18,730
And he told me he just,

5656
02:54:18,880 --> 02:54:20,470
that's how my father would say things.

5657
02:54:20,770 --> 02:54:22,900
He would just tell me things
and that's where I would learn.

5658
02:54:23,290 --> 02:54:24,340
And he just said to me,

5659
02:54:24,940 --> 02:54:26,710
ocean is where all life came from.

5660
02:54:27,130 --> 02:54:29,830
All Life on earth started in the ocean,

5661
02:54:30,520 --> 02:54:31,450
microcosms,

5662
02:54:31,451 --> 02:54:32,300
whatever you want to call.

5663
02:54:32,301 --> 02:54:34,000
They didn't get into all technical stuff,

5664
02:54:34,001 --> 02:54:37,900
but he said it started in the
ocean and it came out onto land.

5665
02:54:38,230 --> 02:54:38,711
He says,

5666
02:54:38,711 --> 02:54:43,450
all percentage of salt in our blood
is the exact same percentage per skew

5667
02:54:43,451 --> 02:54:44,284
begins.

5668
02:54:44,440 --> 02:54:45,130
Q begins,

5669
02:54:45,130 --> 02:54:45,371
you know,

5670
02:54:45,371 --> 02:54:46,204
whatever it was.

5671
02:54:46,210 --> 02:54:46,600
I'm,

5672
02:54:46,600 --> 02:54:48,090
I'm just saying,

5673
02:54:48,310 --> 02:54:50,150
probably not close to what he said,

5674
02:54:50,320 --> 02:54:51,190
but close enough,

5675
02:54:51,530 --> 02:54:52,030
um,

5676
02:54:52,030 --> 02:54:55,180
is the exact amount cubic
inch as it is in the ocean.

5677
02:54:55,390 --> 02:54:56,500
We come from the ocean,

5678
02:54:56,501 --> 02:54:57,940
all life comes from the ocean.

5679
02:54:58,210 --> 02:54:59,830
Go back to where life came from.

5680
02:55:00,970 --> 02:55:01,930
That was enough for me.

5681
02:55:02,740 --> 02:55:03,980
My father was telling me anything.

5682
02:55:03,981 --> 02:55:05,150
My father told me that was it.

5683
02:55:05,840 --> 02:55:07,340
So I said,

5684
02:55:07,341 --> 02:55:08,174
all right.

5685
02:55:08,360 --> 02:55:09,020
So,

5686
02:55:09,020 --> 02:55:09,853
um,

5687
02:55:10,160 --> 02:55:10,911
a matter of fact,

5688
02:55:10,911 --> 02:55:11,721
he told me his story.

5689
02:55:11,721 --> 02:55:14,450
I remember I was going out with a girl,

5690
02:55:14,940 --> 02:55:15,530
um,

5691
02:55:15,530 --> 02:55:16,100
that,

5692
02:55:16,100 --> 02:55:20,400
that had a little baby
that had a bowl lakes.

5693
02:55:20,930 --> 02:55:22,520
And he told me,

5694
02:55:22,521 --> 02:55:23,354
he said,

5695
02:55:23,760 --> 02:55:24,920
and he was serious.

5696
02:55:24,921 --> 02:55:26,150
He wouldn't say it otherwise,

5697
02:55:26,480 --> 02:55:27,860
but he said send it down.

5698
02:55:27,861 --> 02:55:31,130
He had a condominium and they
told the beach and he said,

5699
02:55:31,790 --> 02:55:33,200
send it down to Daytona beach.

5700
02:55:33,201 --> 02:55:36,980
Let him stay there for the summer
and let her boy be in the ocean.

5701
02:55:36,981 --> 02:55:38,390
And the sun vitamin A,

5702
02:55:38,391 --> 02:55:39,011
vitamin D.

5703
02:55:39,011 --> 02:55:39,320
Right.

5704
02:55:39,320 --> 02:55:40,153
I didn't know that.

5705
02:55:40,460 --> 02:55:40,880
Um,

5706
02:55:40,880 --> 02:55:42,230
and it is street in his legs out.

5707
02:55:43,250 --> 02:55:43,581
Yeah,

5708
02:55:43,581 --> 02:55:44,630
his legs or get straight.

5709
02:55:44,630 --> 02:55:45,620
They won't crazy,

5710
02:55:45,621 --> 02:55:45,951
you know,

5711
02:55:45,951 --> 02:55:46,970
but you know,

5712
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:48,200
there was a cook in this to him.

5713
02:55:48,470 --> 02:55:52,940
His legs are good street and he was
right because by being in the ocean,

5714
02:55:52,941 --> 02:55:53,930
by being in the sun,

5715
02:55:53,931 --> 02:55:56,360
vitamin A and d healthy of course.

5716
02:55:56,510 --> 02:56:00,290
I guess part of it was the swimming and
part of it was the ocean and part of it

5717
02:56:00,291 --> 02:56:01,124
was the sun,

5718
02:56:01,280 --> 02:56:02,810
but it was straight in his legs.

5719
02:56:03,400 --> 02:56:06,230
Now looked at he need them to the
point where you had to put braces.

5720
02:56:06,290 --> 02:56:07,123
No,

5721
02:56:07,370 --> 02:56:12,370
but was there was a slight issue was
the initial it was a dramatic no,

5722
02:56:12,680 --> 02:56:13,650
but did,

5723
02:56:13,670 --> 02:56:14,690
but he say work.

5724
02:56:14,720 --> 02:56:15,553
Yeah.

5725
02:56:15,740 --> 02:56:16,370
Was it right?

5726
02:56:16,370 --> 02:56:17,203
Yeah.

5727
02:56:17,660 --> 02:56:17,961
You know,

5728
02:56:17,961 --> 02:56:19,670
but we just think of braces,

5729
02:56:19,700 --> 02:56:19,971
you know,

5730
02:56:19,971 --> 02:56:20,804
obviously.

5731
02:56:21,020 --> 02:56:21,853
And um,

5732
02:56:22,130 --> 02:56:23,810
but yeah,

5733
02:56:23,811 --> 02:56:24,710
and it would heal.

5734
02:56:24,711 --> 02:56:26,120
He would say Glen [inaudible],

5735
02:56:26,300 --> 02:56:28,190
Coney Ocean is salt water.

5736
02:56:28,760 --> 02:56:30,680
He owes the cut.

5737
02:56:30,710 --> 02:56:31,960
It will heal the client.

5738
02:56:32,460 --> 02:56:34,580
A lot of fighters used to
soak their facing Brian,

5739
02:56:34,581 --> 02:56:34,701
right?

5740
02:56:34,701 --> 02:56:35,091
Yes.

5741
02:56:35,091 --> 02:56:35,301
Yeah.

5742
02:56:35,301 --> 02:56:36,320
Well Joe Frazier did.

5743
02:56:36,420 --> 02:56:36,810
Yeah.

5744
02:56:36,810 --> 02:56:40,770
Did that really keep you that your skin
tough and protect you from cuts or is

5745
02:56:40,771 --> 02:56:41,750
that an old wives

5746
02:56:42,040 --> 02:56:42,460
that,

5747
02:56:42,460 --> 02:56:44,260
that's a little bit of that old stuff,

5748
02:56:44,290 --> 02:56:44,740
you know,

5749
02:56:44,740 --> 02:56:45,670
where we don't know.

5750
02:56:45,770 --> 02:56:46,240
Right.

5751
02:56:46,240 --> 02:56:48,280
But they believed it and so,

5752
02:56:48,340 --> 02:56:49,173
you know,

5753
02:56:49,680 --> 02:56:51,100
it smelled like a pickle when he was,

5754
02:56:53,290 --> 02:56:54,330
when he was following with you,

5755
02:56:54,350 --> 02:56:56,130
get hungry in any hit
you a lot of talking.

5756
02:56:59,140 --> 02:57:01,200
What about other controversial
training methods?

5757
02:57:01,201 --> 02:57:04,020
Like a weightlifting for the
longest time was start the taboo.

5758
02:57:04,080 --> 02:57:04,470
Taboo.

5759
02:57:04,470 --> 02:57:05,303
Taboo.

5760
02:57:05,380 --> 02:57:06,010
Holy feel.

5761
02:57:06,010 --> 02:57:06,421
The Mackie.

5762
02:57:06,421 --> 02:57:07,070
She'll stone.

5763
02:57:07,070 --> 02:57:07,680
Yeah.

5764
02:57:07,680 --> 02:57:10,950
Maggie shell stones training or Holyfield
and moving him up from a cruiser way

5765
02:57:10,960 --> 02:57:11,793
to a heavyweight.

5766
02:57:11,860 --> 02:57:12,980
He true and very,

5767
02:57:12,981 --> 02:57:14,640
it was a very light heavy
weight at the beginning.

5768
02:57:14,641 --> 02:57:15,180
Right.

5769
02:57:15,180 --> 02:57:16,280
Cruiserweight yeah,

5770
02:57:16,380 --> 02:57:19,200
we really essentially was and
they just pack some meat on them.

5771
02:57:19,410 --> 02:57:20,730
Michael Spinks with Yup,

5772
02:57:21,030 --> 02:57:21,480
that's right.

5773
02:57:21,480 --> 02:57:22,920
Michael Spinks was really the first.

5774
02:57:22,950 --> 02:57:23,370
Yeah.

5775
02:57:23,370 --> 02:57:27,360
When he fought Larry Holmes and Mackey
shall stone worked with Holyfield after

5776
02:57:27,361 --> 02:57:27,690
that.

5777
02:57:27,690 --> 02:57:28,523
That's right.

5778
02:57:28,930 --> 02:57:29,390
Um,

5779
02:57:29,390 --> 02:57:30,223
yeah.

5780
02:57:30,620 --> 02:57:32,280
Listen and Gleason,

5781
02:57:32,290 --> 02:57:33,460
I'm going to go back to Gleason's.

5782
02:57:33,470 --> 02:57:34,303
The epicenter,

5783
02:57:34,310 --> 02:57:35,120
you know,

5784
02:57:35,120 --> 02:57:35,953
to place

5785
02:57:37,100 --> 02:57:37,933
no water,

5786
02:57:38,090 --> 02:57:38,810
no weights.

5787
02:57:38,810 --> 02:57:39,643
Right.

5788
02:57:40,160 --> 02:57:40,700
I got,

5789
02:57:40,700 --> 02:57:43,760
I used to have my fighters
to wait if I felt,

5790
02:57:45,410 --> 02:57:48,380
if I felt that a fighter wasn't
physically strong enough,

5791
02:57:48,680 --> 02:57:49,880
I put him on a weight program,

5792
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:50,990
but I do it myself.

5793
02:57:51,030 --> 02:57:51,500
I I,

5794
02:57:51,500 --> 02:57:53,120
there was no strength coaches back then.

5795
02:57:53,360 --> 02:57:53,601
But,

5796
02:57:53,601 --> 02:57:56,480
but just the common sense
program says three days a week,

5797
02:57:56,810 --> 02:57:57,290
you know,

5798
02:57:57,290 --> 02:57:58,101
eat protein.

5799
02:57:58,101 --> 02:58:01,620
Of course you have to replenish yourself
with the proper diet and all that

5800
02:58:01,621 --> 02:58:02,160
stuff,

5801
02:58:02,160 --> 02:58:02,790
but,

5802
02:58:02,790 --> 02:58:05,700
and do it at the right time in between
the training where you're not killing,

5803
02:58:05,701 --> 02:58:08,480
you say overtraining
know go spar and tire.

5804
02:58:08,490 --> 02:58:09,323
That's right.

5805
02:58:09,370 --> 02:58:11,640
You don't have to separation of workouts.

5806
02:58:11,910 --> 02:58:16,890
But if I had a slightly built guy that I
taught two things and the second one is

5807
02:58:16,891 --> 02:58:20,070
one where probably sounds a
little that you wouldn't have,

5808
02:58:21,190 --> 02:58:22,710
wouldn't normally connect to it.

5809
02:58:23,070 --> 02:58:26,130
But the first thing was if I thought he
could physically be a little stronger,

5810
02:58:26,700 --> 02:58:28,800
not that he had to be fighting inside,

5811
02:58:28,801 --> 02:58:30,290
but when he did fight inside,

5812
02:58:30,291 --> 02:58:31,110
because let's face it,

5813
02:58:31,110 --> 02:58:31,890
you're a fighter,

5814
02:58:31,890 --> 02:58:33,360
you're going to wind up and walk quarters.

5815
02:58:33,390 --> 02:58:34,080
You are,

5816
02:58:34,080 --> 02:58:34,681
even though you say,

5817
02:58:34,681 --> 02:58:34,801
well,

5818
02:58:34,801 --> 02:58:35,940
I'm going to live on the outside.

5819
02:58:35,970 --> 02:58:36,803
Okay.

5820
02:58:36,810 --> 02:58:39,060
Until that day that the Guy
Slips Your Jab and again,

5821
02:58:39,330 --> 02:58:40,830
now you live in any insight.

5822
02:58:41,250 --> 02:58:43,260
Are you ready to live on
the inside for a minute?

5823
02:58:43,590 --> 02:58:45,210
So I believe that.

5824
02:58:45,390 --> 02:58:48,510
So I would make my guys two
weights if I do it physically,

5825
02:58:48,511 --> 02:58:50,970
they could get help and
improvement in those areas,

5826
02:58:50,971 --> 02:58:54,000
but I also did it for
the psychological reason.

5827
02:58:54,540 --> 02:58:57,990
I felt that it's all psychological battle.

5828
02:58:58,050 --> 02:58:59,790
It's 75% psychological,

5829
02:58:59,791 --> 02:59:00,624
mental,

5830
02:59:00,900 --> 02:59:04,890
and you have to do any gene you can
to help to fight her in that area.

5831
02:59:04,980 --> 02:59:05,640
Anything,

5832
02:59:05,640 --> 02:59:06,271
anything,

5833
02:59:06,271 --> 02:59:07,260
grab anything.

5834
02:59:07,261 --> 02:59:11,790
That's if there's something floating
over your head are grabbing anything and

5835
02:59:12,540 --> 02:59:13,380
the mental part.

5836
02:59:13,810 --> 02:59:15,780
If if you make them feel stronger,

5837
02:59:16,980 --> 02:59:17,880
he'll be stronger.

5838
02:59:18,180 --> 02:59:19,710
If that's something that,

5839
02:59:19,920 --> 02:59:24,920
that just gives him a little I
older more of confidence and belief.

5840
02:59:25,380 --> 02:59:25,891
Now listen,

5841
02:59:25,891 --> 02:59:26,460
here's the,

5842
02:59:26,460 --> 02:59:30,600
here's the catch 22 maybe you
don't want the guy fighting inside.

5843
02:59:30,601 --> 02:59:31,530
Maybe his style,

5844
02:59:31,531 --> 02:59:35,000
his makeup is the fight I get to because
of the smart guys out there listening.

5845
02:59:35,020 --> 02:59:35,853
I'm sure there are.

5846
02:59:35,970 --> 02:59:37,910
They're going to think
that before he said it.

5847
02:59:38,160 --> 02:59:38,880
Yeah,

5848
02:59:38,880 --> 02:59:40,080
I still want him to feel strong.

5849
02:59:40,081 --> 02:59:40,914
Okay.

5850
02:59:41,100 --> 02:59:41,933
I'm not going to make,

5851
02:59:41,970 --> 02:59:43,950
I'm not going to make a
guide that should box,

5852
02:59:43,951 --> 02:59:46,770
like pinel would go was
your box like Muhammad Ali.

5853
02:59:46,920 --> 02:59:49,290
I'm not going to let them Mike
and fight like Jake Lamata.

5854
02:59:49,420 --> 02:59:49,590
Oh,

5855
02:59:49,590 --> 02:59:50,423
I,

5856
02:59:50,430 --> 02:59:51,360
I'm okay with that.

5857
02:59:51,690 --> 02:59:53,400
But I want them to feel stronger.

5858
02:59:53,940 --> 02:59:54,710
I fought them.

5859
02:59:54,710 --> 02:59:56,520
So what kind of weightlifting
would you have them do?

5860
02:59:57,060 --> 02:59:57,780
Because you're,

5861
02:59:57,780 --> 03:00:00,060
do you have a background in
lifting weights yourself?

5862
03:00:00,120 --> 03:00:00,360
No,

5863
03:00:00,360 --> 03:00:00,571
no.

5864
03:00:00,571 --> 03:00:02,010
Other than I played football,

5865
03:00:02,011 --> 03:00:03,780
so he was around it and,

5866
03:00:03,870 --> 03:00:04,300
and I,

5867
03:00:04,300 --> 03:00:06,680
I've been around Jim's my whole life and,

5868
03:00:06,681 --> 03:00:08,550
and fitness people all my life.

5869
03:00:08,760 --> 03:00:11,160
So I understand the plyometrics.

5870
03:00:11,161 --> 03:00:12,810
I understood all the advancements,

5871
03:00:12,811 --> 03:00:14,190
all the new stuff that came out,

5872
03:00:14,430 --> 03:00:15,300
the bands that,

5873
03:00:15,420 --> 03:00:15,751
you know,

5874
03:00:15,751 --> 03:00:16,290
the,

5875
03:00:16,290 --> 03:00:16,471
Hey,

5876
03:00:16,471 --> 03:00:16,771
listen,

5877
03:00:16,771 --> 03:00:19,180
you've got to remember there was
a guy named Charles Atlas that,

5878
03:00:19,470 --> 03:00:21,750
that started with resistance training.

5879
03:00:21,850 --> 03:00:22,720
He was,

5880
03:00:22,740 --> 03:00:22,950
uh,

5881
03:00:22,950 --> 03:00:25,380
somebody kicked sand in his
face and his comic book.

5882
03:00:26,100 --> 03:00:26,520
Right.

5883
03:00:26,520 --> 03:00:26,941
And,

5884
03:00:26,941 --> 03:00:28,020
and you know,

5885
03:00:28,021 --> 03:00:29,400
I don't know if it was related or not,

5886
03:00:29,610 --> 03:00:29,911
but,

5887
03:00:29,911 --> 03:00:30,744
um,

5888
03:00:30,750 --> 03:00:31,740
but you know,

5889
03:00:31,790 --> 03:00:31,971
he,

5890
03:00:31,971 --> 03:00:33,210
he did isometrics.

5891
03:00:33,330 --> 03:00:34,710
I believed in Isometrix.

5892
03:00:34,860 --> 03:00:37,040
I did isometrics for the whole camp with,

5893
03:00:37,100 --> 03:00:38,910
but Michael Morell for
the Holyfield fight,

5894
03:00:38,911 --> 03:00:39,744
believe it or not.

5895
03:00:39,990 --> 03:00:40,540
Yeah.

5896
03:00:40,540 --> 03:00:44,370
I used to put my hand here and I used
to make him push against my hand,

5897
03:00:44,550 --> 03:00:46,260
but ways that we can push it,

5898
03:00:46,440 --> 03:00:51,440
I would design all kinds of different
exercises in ways to do it where I just

5899
03:00:52,021 --> 03:00:53,700
gave him resistance with my own body,

5900
03:00:54,330 --> 03:00:56,070
sometimes push against my shoulder,

5901
03:00:57,330 --> 03:00:57,571
you know,

5902
03:00:57,571 --> 03:00:58,580
and be careful to join.

5903
03:00:58,600 --> 03:00:59,460
She won't in the,

5904
03:00:59,610 --> 03:01:00,100
you know,

5905
03:01:00,100 --> 03:01:01,330
all common sense stuff.

5906
03:01:01,380 --> 03:01:01,870
Yeah.

5907
03:01:01,870 --> 03:01:02,560
But,

5908
03:01:02,560 --> 03:01:03,100
um,

5909
03:01:03,100 --> 03:01:03,580
so we,

5910
03:01:03,580 --> 03:01:03,840
we,

5911
03:01:03,840 --> 03:01:05,830
this is something that
you thought of yourself,

5912
03:01:05,831 --> 03:01:08,500
you were trying to figure out how to
do it and then you just implemented it.

5913
03:01:08,560 --> 03:01:09,393
Yeah.

5914
03:01:09,730 --> 03:01:09,881
Yeah.

5915
03:01:09,881 --> 03:01:13,690
This is something that a Michael Moore
man when he was a light heavyweight was a

5916
03:01:13,691 --> 03:01:14,950
murderous puncher.

5917
03:01:15,310 --> 03:01:16,680
Murder murderous boy.

5918
03:01:16,681 --> 03:01:17,290
Oh boy.

5919
03:01:17,290 --> 03:01:18,123
Whoo.

5920
03:01:18,160 --> 03:01:19,090
He was dangerous.

5921
03:01:19,120 --> 03:01:20,140
He was so scary.

5922
03:01:20,141 --> 03:01:22,720
But though it seemed like the
weight cut was too brutal.

5923
03:01:23,320 --> 03:01:23,711
Yeah.

5924
03:01:23,711 --> 03:01:24,670
It was brutal.

5925
03:01:24,760 --> 03:01:25,593
And um,

5926
03:01:25,750 --> 03:01:27,580
he was a terrifying light heavyweight.

5927
03:01:27,610 --> 03:01:27,851
Yeah,

5928
03:01:27,851 --> 03:01:28,500
he was,

5929
03:01:28,500 --> 03:01:29,350
I forgot about him.

5930
03:01:29,380 --> 03:01:31,000
They forgot about him
as a light heavyweight.

5931
03:01:31,001 --> 03:01:31,930
He'd knocked everyone out.

5932
03:01:32,110 --> 03:01:32,321
Just,

5933
03:01:32,321 --> 03:01:32,990
I mean,

5934
03:01:32,990 --> 03:01:34,870
I don't think he went the
distance with anybody.

5935
03:01:34,960 --> 03:01:35,790
He was murdering people.

5936
03:01:35,790 --> 03:01:35,980
Yeah.

5937
03:01:35,980 --> 03:01:37,210
He was really something.

5938
03:01:37,370 --> 03:01:37,900
Yeah.

5939
03:01:37,900 --> 03:01:39,130
And a first heavyweight,

5940
03:01:39,210 --> 03:01:39,520
uh,

5941
03:01:39,520 --> 03:01:42,190
first sal point heavyweight
champ of whole time first.

5942
03:01:42,250 --> 03:01:43,083
Is that true?

5943
03:01:43,270 --> 03:01:43,810
Wow.

5944
03:01:43,810 --> 03:01:44,643
Yeah.

5945
03:01:45,100 --> 03:01:45,760
Wow.

5946
03:01:45,760 --> 03:01:46,360
Yeah,

5947
03:01:46,360 --> 03:01:46,901
that'd be true.

5948
03:01:46,901 --> 03:01:47,734
I've been saying,

5949
03:01:47,970 --> 03:01:48,803
I'm sure it is.

5950
03:01:49,210 --> 03:01:49,840
I didn't know.

5951
03:01:49,840 --> 03:01:50,111
Yeah,

5952
03:01:50,111 --> 03:01:50,321
no,

5953
03:01:50,321 --> 03:01:51,100
he was,

5954
03:01:51,100 --> 03:01:52,900
it could make him a good person.

5955
03:01:52,901 --> 03:01:53,570
Very good guy.

5956
03:01:53,570 --> 03:01:53,790
Yeah.

5957
03:01:53,790 --> 03:01:55,570
He's like all of us,

5958
03:01:55,571 --> 03:01:57,820
we get lost and we get confused.

5959
03:01:57,821 --> 03:01:58,654
All of us,

5960
03:01:59,020 --> 03:01:59,853
but he's a good,

5961
03:01:59,890 --> 03:02:00,191
you know,

5962
03:02:00,191 --> 03:02:01,180
you're good or you're not good,

5963
03:02:01,181 --> 03:02:01,430
right?

5964
03:02:01,430 --> 03:02:01,860
Yeah.

5965
03:02:01,860 --> 03:02:03,210
He's you,

5966
03:02:03,260 --> 03:02:04,450
you want to hear crazy thing.

5967
03:02:04,900 --> 03:02:05,733
Um,

5968
03:02:06,450 --> 03:02:07,283
some people might,

5969
03:02:07,530 --> 03:02:08,363
I hope they don't.

5970
03:02:09,720 --> 03:02:10,290
Whatever.

5971
03:02:10,290 --> 03:02:12,420
I hope they don't take it the wrong way,

5972
03:02:12,421 --> 03:02:13,830
but anyway,

5973
03:02:15,150 --> 03:02:16,620
it's meant to be the good way.

5974
03:02:17,370 --> 03:02:18,203
Um,

5975
03:02:19,770 --> 03:02:20,431
I have a friend,

5976
03:02:20,431 --> 03:02:21,180
a very close for,

5977
03:02:21,180 --> 03:02:22,230
I hate politicians.

5978
03:02:22,470 --> 03:02:22,790
I did.

5979
03:02:22,790 --> 03:02:23,623
They're phony,

5980
03:02:23,910 --> 03:02:25,410
but I have one that's,

5981
03:02:25,980 --> 03:02:26,300
he,

5982
03:02:26,300 --> 03:02:27,660
he makes a live in a politician,

5983
03:02:27,661 --> 03:02:29,100
but he don't live as a politician.

5984
03:02:29,270 --> 03:02:30,103
Does that make sense?

5985
03:02:31,110 --> 03:02:32,750
He's the president of stand on,

5986
03:02:32,760 --> 03:02:33,593
his name is Jimmy Hall,

5987
03:02:33,930 --> 03:02:36,110
and I'm probably go crazy,

5988
03:02:36,111 --> 03:02:37,110
but here's this put anyway.

5989
03:02:37,740 --> 03:02:38,573
It's okay.

5990
03:02:39,000 --> 03:02:39,691
He's a little crazy.

5991
03:02:39,691 --> 03:02:39,931
Anyway,

5992
03:02:39,931 --> 03:02:40,800
that's why we get along.

5993
03:02:41,100 --> 03:02:41,940
But he's a good man.

5994
03:02:42,450 --> 03:02:42,900
And,

5995
03:02:42,900 --> 03:02:43,670
uh,

5996
03:02:43,670 --> 03:02:45,540
like my father was born to be a doctor.

5997
03:02:45,541 --> 03:02:46,374
He was,

5998
03:02:46,510 --> 03:02:47,343
his mother knew it.

5999
03:02:48,120 --> 03:02:49,440
He was born to be,

6000
03:02:51,550 --> 03:02:52,383
I don't know,

6001
03:02:52,470 --> 03:02:53,840
I don't want to use the word politician.

6002
03:02:53,850 --> 03:02:55,190
Seems like a dirty word leader.

6003
03:02:55,560 --> 03:02:55,950
Yeah.

6004
03:02:55,950 --> 03:02:56,750
Aliyah.

6005
03:02:56,750 --> 03:02:56,990
Uh,

6006
03:02:56,990 --> 03:02:58,020
a carer of people.

6007
03:02:58,260 --> 03:02:59,093
All right.

6008
03:02:59,760 --> 03:03:00,930
I'm a public servant,

6009
03:03:00,931 --> 03:03:01,764
maybe whatever.

6010
03:03:01,770 --> 03:03:02,603
But anyway,

6011
03:03:03,090 --> 03:03:06,660
so he's the bowl
president of Sinai and he,

6012
03:03:06,870 --> 03:03:09,960
he really does things and um,

6013
03:03:11,550 --> 03:03:12,030
anyway,

6014
03:03:12,030 --> 03:03:16,680
we're close and he just gave is $94,000
for the foundation like a week ago.

6015
03:03:17,520 --> 03:03:18,353
He does that.

6016
03:03:18,390 --> 03:03:20,280
He finds the money and you know,

6017
03:03:20,640 --> 03:03:21,473
he knows,

6018
03:03:21,500 --> 03:03:23,010
he says is the greatest compliment.

6019
03:03:23,011 --> 03:03:23,281
He goes,

6020
03:03:23,281 --> 03:03:23,590
I know.

6021
03:03:23,590 --> 03:03:24,423
It's called,

6022
03:03:25,080 --> 03:03:25,950
I know where it's going.

6023
03:03:26,520 --> 03:03:27,353
And um,

6024
03:03:28,170 --> 03:03:28,651
thank you.

6025
03:03:28,651 --> 03:03:29,311
He says to me,

6026
03:03:29,311 --> 03:03:29,491
I said,

6027
03:03:29,491 --> 03:03:30,390
what do you think of me for?

6028
03:03:30,391 --> 03:03:31,224
Thank you.

6029
03:03:31,380 --> 03:03:33,000
I can't help these people without you.

6030
03:03:33,170 --> 03:03:33,391
You know,

6031
03:03:33,391 --> 03:03:34,140
I get all the help.

6032
03:03:34,140 --> 03:03:36,000
We do fundraisers and we do things.

6033
03:03:36,270 --> 03:03:37,140
We do a big dinner,

6034
03:03:37,141 --> 03:03:40,710
thousand people a week before Thanksgiving
where we are people like Tony Dancer

6035
03:03:40,711 --> 03:03:43,050
and Phil Sims and bill
pause cells use to calm.

6036
03:03:43,200 --> 03:03:44,100
He don't come no more.

6037
03:03:44,101 --> 03:03:45,510
He don't leave Florida anymore.

6038
03:03:45,930 --> 03:03:46,440
But,

6039
03:03:46,440 --> 03:03:46,681
but,

6040
03:03:46,681 --> 03:03:47,160
um,

6041
03:03:47,160 --> 03:03:47,791
you know,

6042
03:03:47,791 --> 03:03:48,624
we,

6043
03:03:49,110 --> 03:03:53,120
I mean Patrick Ewing
to Campbell Mutombo uh,

6044
03:03:53,430 --> 03:03:53,941
uh,

6045
03:03:53,941 --> 03:03:54,780
I mean we're,

6046
03:03:54,781 --> 03:03:55,590
we're blessed.

6047
03:03:55,590 --> 03:03:57,120
We're blessed with Voz Perez.

6048
03:03:57,290 --> 03:03:58,123
She loved pork.

6049
03:03:58,640 --> 03:03:59,430
She loves me.

6050
03:03:59,430 --> 03:04:00,020
Yeah.

6051
03:04:00,020 --> 03:04:02,330
I mean we were blessed.

6052
03:04:03,110 --> 03:04:03,860
Um,

6053
03:04:03,860 --> 03:04:05,720
Brandon Marshall from
the giants last year,

6054
03:04:06,680 --> 03:04:11,680
they come and they allow me to have a
successful dinner because they come and

6055
03:04:11,841 --> 03:04:14,000
they don't get a sense
because nobody gets a sense.

6056
03:04:14,660 --> 03:04:15,500
And um,

6057
03:04:16,400 --> 03:04:18,620
so with all that in with Jimmy,

6058
03:04:19,160 --> 03:04:20,360
so anyway,

6059
03:04:20,930 --> 03:04:23,720
I have these things that
I just say sometimes.

6060
03:04:23,930 --> 03:04:25,190
So he caught me one time,

6061
03:04:25,250 --> 03:04:26,390
but I was just saying it,

6062
03:04:26,750 --> 03:04:28,580
I didn't realize that it
was going to register,

6063
03:04:28,610 --> 03:04:28,821
you know,

6064
03:04:28,821 --> 03:04:29,870
because it's just something,

6065
03:04:30,410 --> 03:04:31,243
you know,

6066
03:04:31,580 --> 03:04:32,413
so I just said,

6067
03:04:33,470 --> 03:04:34,910
I said people bad.

6068
03:04:35,510 --> 03:04:35,991
So he said,

6069
03:04:35,991 --> 03:04:36,824
why?

6070
03:04:37,940 --> 03:04:38,530
I said,

6071
03:04:38,530 --> 03:04:39,363
well,

6072
03:04:39,740 --> 03:04:40,610
because what you say?

6073
03:04:41,030 --> 03:04:41,850
I said no,

6074
03:04:41,850 --> 03:04:44,660
I said two words to live by people bad.

6075
03:04:44,960 --> 03:04:45,810
So I've choking her,

6076
03:04:45,950 --> 03:04:47,000
but he said people bed.

6077
03:04:47,630 --> 03:04:49,040
So he said,

6078
03:04:49,041 --> 03:04:49,460
what do you mean?

6079
03:04:49,460 --> 03:04:50,293
I said,

6080
03:04:50,450 --> 03:04:51,560
people bad.

6081
03:04:51,860 --> 03:04:52,191
He said,

6082
03:04:52,191 --> 03:04:52,920
but you help,

6083
03:04:52,920 --> 03:04:53,900
you're in the business.

6084
03:04:54,140 --> 03:04:54,840
I said,

6085
03:04:54,840 --> 03:04:56,000
just good people too.

6086
03:04:56,930 --> 03:04:57,763
So anyway,

6087
03:04:58,070 --> 03:04:58,970
about a month ago,

6088
03:04:59,240 --> 03:04:59,841
two months ago,

6089
03:04:59,841 --> 03:05:00,350
whatever,

6090
03:05:00,350 --> 03:05:01,520
he comes up to me and he says,

6091
03:05:01,521 --> 03:05:02,870
you've got to think I'm out of my mind.

6092
03:05:03,230 --> 03:05:03,531
I said,

6093
03:05:03,531 --> 03:05:03,621
well,

6094
03:05:03,621 --> 03:05:03,771
no,

6095
03:05:03,771 --> 03:05:04,450
I know,

6096
03:05:04,450 --> 03:05:05,530
but for what?

6097
03:05:05,610 --> 03:05:06,560
What's the matter?

6098
03:05:06,980 --> 03:05:07,813
He said,

6099
03:05:08,630 --> 03:05:09,620
with your permission,

6100
03:05:10,670 --> 03:05:11,900
I want to take a domain,

6101
03:05:11,901 --> 03:05:13,400
which I barely know what that means.

6102
03:05:13,760 --> 03:05:14,593
Copyright,

6103
03:05:14,620 --> 03:05:16,880
the phrase people bad.

6104
03:05:17,960 --> 03:05:18,793
And

6105
03:05:20,300 --> 03:05:23,780
if I told you I wanted to start a
business with you and me and the proceeds,

6106
03:05:24,260 --> 03:05:26,210
some of the proceeds will
go to the foundation.

6107
03:05:26,570 --> 03:05:27,710
We sell shorts would do that.

6108
03:05:28,010 --> 03:05:29,600
And you have these different sayings.

6109
03:05:29,870 --> 03:05:30,920
So to start with people,

6110
03:05:30,921 --> 03:05:33,800
bad resiliency,

6111
03:05:33,801 --> 03:05:34,371
good people,

6112
03:05:34,371 --> 03:05:36,320
bad forgiveness,

6113
03:05:36,321 --> 03:05:37,160
good people,

6114
03:05:37,161 --> 03:05:38,870
bad be better people,

6115
03:05:38,871 --> 03:05:40,730
bad parks,

6116
03:05:40,731 --> 03:05:41,564
good

6117
03:05:42,890 --> 03:05:43,281
people,

6118
03:05:43,281 --> 03:05:44,114
bad,

6119
03:05:44,360 --> 03:05:45,193
you know,

6120
03:05:45,440 --> 03:05:46,191
redemption,

6121
03:05:46,191 --> 03:05:48,440
good people bad.

6122
03:05:49,490 --> 03:05:50,600
That's be bad,

6123
03:05:50,630 --> 03:05:50,901
you know,

6124
03:05:50,901 --> 03:05:51,321
whatever.

6125
03:05:51,321 --> 03:05:56,321
But the whole idea is to be unapologetic
and to say we got a problem.

6126
03:05:57,860 --> 03:05:59,930
I don't know if you want to
say we're at a tilting point,

6127
03:06:00,170 --> 03:06:01,010
but we got a problem.

6128
03:06:01,030 --> 03:06:02,360
If my a social genius,

6129
03:06:02,361 --> 03:06:02,990
no,

6130
03:06:02,990 --> 03:06:03,830
am I a saint?

6131
03:06:03,831 --> 03:06:04,664
No,

6132
03:06:05,240 --> 03:06:06,200
but I got kids.

6133
03:06:07,100 --> 03:06:09,500
I care about what the world is.

6134
03:06:10,250 --> 03:06:11,083
You know,

6135
03:06:11,120 --> 03:06:12,710
maybe if I didn't have
kids that still care

6136
03:06:14,210 --> 03:06:15,800
and I have grandchildren now,

6137
03:06:15,801 --> 03:06:16,400
I have to often,

6138
03:06:16,400 --> 03:06:17,233
they're beautiful.

6139
03:06:17,720 --> 03:06:20,240
And you know what,

6140
03:06:21,140 --> 03:06:22,430
there's a lot of bad people out there.

6141
03:06:22,910 --> 03:06:24,650
I'm not apologize or about saying that.

6142
03:06:24,651 --> 03:06:25,970
There's a lot of great people,

6143
03:06:26,270 --> 03:06:27,380
there's more good people,

6144
03:06:28,100 --> 03:06:29,520
but it's,

6145
03:06:29,560 --> 03:06:31,100
it's like turning a battle line,

6146
03:06:32,450 --> 03:06:33,770
a line of resistance,

6147
03:06:33,771 --> 03:06:37,820
really where I want to
call people out on it.

6148
03:06:37,850 --> 03:06:39,740
I want to remind us
that we could be better.

6149
03:06:39,920 --> 03:06:44,840
I want to remind us that
people bad selfishness,

6150
03:06:44,841 --> 03:06:45,674
worse.

6151
03:06:46,770 --> 03:06:47,110
And,

6152
03:06:47,110 --> 03:06:47,780
and I,

6153
03:06:47,780 --> 03:06:48,613
I just want to,

6154
03:06:49,180 --> 03:06:51,500
to what he brought my attention to it,

6155
03:06:51,501 --> 03:06:56,501
because I used to use that phrase so
frequently when I was mad and he said,

6156
03:06:56,881 --> 03:06:59,100
that's turn your med
into something better,

6157
03:06:59,880 --> 03:07:00,360
teddy.

6158
03:07:00,360 --> 03:07:03,150
That's debts because I
know what you stand for.

6159
03:07:03,151 --> 03:07:03,601
I know I,

6160
03:07:03,601 --> 03:07:06,750
that's why I give you
what I give you 22 years.

6161
03:07:07,290 --> 03:07:10,320
So people are bad,

6162
03:07:10,770 --> 03:07:11,191
but they,

6163
03:07:11,191 --> 03:07:12,024
they're good.

6164
03:07:12,510 --> 03:07:13,343
They're good.

6165
03:07:13,500 --> 03:07:16,830
That remind people that
we need to be good,

6166
03:07:17,070 --> 03:07:18,090
that remind people,

6167
03:07:18,091 --> 03:07:19,440
that's call a monocrop.

6168
03:07:20,050 --> 03:07:20,350
That's,

6169
03:07:20,350 --> 03:07:21,450
that's freaking say,

6170
03:07:21,510 --> 03:07:22,343
hey,

6171
03:07:22,440 --> 03:07:23,370
we got to be better.

6172
03:07:24,170 --> 03:07:26,130
We've got to care about the right things.

6173
03:07:26,600 --> 03:07:29,040
We've got to stop getting
caught up in our crap,

6174
03:07:29,670 --> 03:07:30,503
you know,

6175
03:07:30,690 --> 03:07:34,590
and we gotta be stronger people.

6176
03:07:34,591 --> 03:07:34,910
Bed,

6177
03:07:34,910 --> 03:07:35,790
don't be weak,

6178
03:07:36,750 --> 03:07:37,583
you know.

6179
03:07:37,770 --> 03:07:39,180
But in other words,

6180
03:07:39,181 --> 03:07:40,090
we're using it to,

6181
03:07:40,250 --> 03:07:44,430
to remind people that sometimes
we'll go into in a bad direction.

6182
03:07:44,910 --> 03:07:46,170
We are looking at the world.

6183
03:07:46,171 --> 03:07:46,650
Look at that.

6184
03:07:46,650 --> 03:07:46,891
You know,

6185
03:07:46,891 --> 03:07:48,750
when I was flying here was
reading the New York Post,

6186
03:07:49,050 --> 03:07:52,110
do you know how want people
think I'm weak or something?

6187
03:07:52,530 --> 03:07:56,220
But I didn't want to read some of the
stories about some of these kids that got

6188
03:07:56,221 --> 03:07:56,970
killed.

6189
03:07:56,970 --> 03:08:01,970
There was a story about a parent that
someone at a hospital in Manhattan that

6190
03:08:03,811 --> 03:08:06,450
decided to slice up a bunch of infants,

6191
03:08:06,800 --> 03:08:07,530
um,

6192
03:08:07,530 --> 03:08:12,530
just ran to the hallway of his place was
for Chinese immigrants that they go to

6193
03:08:13,831 --> 03:08:18,831
this place where now young mothers where
they think it's a safe haven for the

6194
03:08:19,591 --> 03:08:21,600
children to be there for like a month.

6195
03:08:22,050 --> 03:08:23,640
And so they infants two days,

6196
03:08:23,641 --> 03:08:26,900
all five days or 10 days
old and they're all in.

6197
03:08:26,901 --> 03:08:29,370
It was all Chinese immigrants
and they're all in there.

6198
03:08:29,880 --> 03:08:34,880
These babies and this woman walks in there
with a knife and start stabbing these

6199
03:08:35,791 --> 03:08:36,624
kids.

6200
03:08:36,930 --> 03:08:37,560
Now listen,

6201
03:08:37,560 --> 03:08:38,391
I know a lot of people,

6202
03:08:38,391 --> 03:08:39,360
are they going to say teddy?

6203
03:08:39,361 --> 03:08:40,290
That's psychotic.

6204
03:08:40,320 --> 03:08:41,190
That's different.

6205
03:08:41,220 --> 03:08:41,700
I,

6206
03:08:41,700 --> 03:08:42,300
yes,

6207
03:08:42,300 --> 03:08:42,990
yes,

6208
03:08:42,990 --> 03:08:43,823
yes.

6209
03:08:44,790 --> 03:08:45,570
It's evil.

6210
03:08:45,570 --> 03:08:45,781
Yeah,

6211
03:08:45,781 --> 03:08:46,650
there's evil in the world.

6212
03:08:46,680 --> 03:08:47,513
Yeah,

6213
03:08:48,090 --> 03:08:49,170
but I'm just,

6214
03:08:49,230 --> 03:08:50,640
I'm just calling to arms.

6215
03:08:50,700 --> 03:08:51,630
I'm not the guy,

6216
03:08:51,930 --> 03:08:54,660
but I'm just saying in my
small way called arms that

6217
03:08:57,210 --> 03:08:58,080
we can be better.

6218
03:08:58,800 --> 03:09:00,810
That just remind people that,

6219
03:09:01,830 --> 03:09:02,663
you know what?

6220
03:09:03,240 --> 03:09:04,920
We have so much promise.

6221
03:09:06,120 --> 03:09:07,800
There's so much to be

6222
03:09:09,300 --> 03:09:10,740
grateful for in this country,

6223
03:09:11,190 --> 03:09:12,810
particularly in the world,

6224
03:09:12,811 --> 03:09:13,680
but not always.

6225
03:09:14,130 --> 03:09:16,950
And we have so much here that's be better.

6226
03:09:17,370 --> 03:09:19,290
If people bed that's help them be better.

6227
03:09:20,190 --> 03:09:21,690
That's lead the way to be better.

6228
03:09:22,560 --> 03:09:22,850
Uh,

6229
03:09:22,850 --> 03:09:23,281
that's,

6230
03:09:23,281 --> 03:09:23,940
that's,

6231
03:09:23,940 --> 03:09:25,290
that's take a stance.

6232
03:09:26,010 --> 03:09:27,210
So we're going to,

6233
03:09:27,420 --> 03:09:28,290
I don't know how the freak,

6234
03:09:28,291 --> 03:09:29,124
we're going to do it,

6235
03:09:29,160 --> 03:09:32,220
but we're going to start this company.

6236
03:09:32,490 --> 03:09:32,941
People bear.

6237
03:09:32,941 --> 03:09:35,280
But then we're going to have
all these inspirational,

6238
03:09:35,281 --> 03:09:36,060
if you will.

6239
03:09:36,060 --> 03:09:37,560
But all these positive,

6240
03:09:37,860 --> 03:09:38,910
positive,

6241
03:09:39,060 --> 03:09:39,960
positive

6242
03:09:41,490 --> 03:09:43,200
things to say that,

6243
03:09:43,320 --> 03:09:46,860
to remind you that in know where
you can be anything you want to be.

6244
03:09:46,861 --> 03:09:47,071
You know,

6245
03:09:47,071 --> 03:09:49,440
that old saying you could
be anything you want to be,

6246
03:09:50,780 --> 03:09:52,200
but some people choose to be bad.

6247
03:09:53,130 --> 03:09:54,130
Let's choose to be better.

6248
03:09:55,480 --> 03:09:55,961
And,

6249
03:09:55,961 --> 03:09:56,794
um,

6250
03:09:56,800 --> 03:09:57,850
so we're going to do some,

6251
03:09:57,851 --> 03:09:58,120
the,

6252
03:09:58,120 --> 03:09:59,410
some of the proceeds go to the father.

6253
03:09:59,590 --> 03:10:02,210
I don't know how the freak were
probably whatever is going on,

6254
03:10:02,440 --> 03:10:03,360
but we,

6255
03:10:03,450 --> 03:10:04,930
we're going to figure it out.

6256
03:10:05,250 --> 03:10:06,083
Um,

6257
03:10:06,550 --> 03:10:09,730
he's going to do it all
because I only know boxing.

6258
03:10:10,870 --> 03:10:11,980
I think you know more than that.

6259
03:10:12,280 --> 03:10:12,641
Listen,

6260
03:10:12,641 --> 03:10:13,210
Teddy,

6261
03:10:13,210 --> 03:10:14,260
there's been three hours.

6262
03:10:14,400 --> 03:10:14,710
Oh,

6263
03:10:14,710 --> 03:10:15,543
I'm sorry.

6264
03:10:16,150 --> 03:10:17,080
Don't be sorry.

6265
03:10:17,081 --> 03:10:17,890
It was great.

6266
03:10:17,890 --> 03:10:19,330
I really appreciate you being here,

6267
03:10:19,331 --> 03:10:19,660
man.

6268
03:10:19,660 --> 03:10:20,200
Wow.

6269
03:10:20,200 --> 03:10:20,770
I know.

6270
03:10:20,770 --> 03:10:23,170
It's actually a little bit
more than three hours and,

6271
03:10:23,171 --> 03:10:23,920
uh,

6272
03:10:23,920 --> 03:10:25,090
thanks for that was beautiful.

6273
03:10:25,091 --> 03:10:26,590
Thanks man.

6274
03:10:27,070 --> 03:10:27,401
Thank you.

6275
03:10:27,401 --> 03:10:28,234
Appreciate you.

6276
03:10:28,390 --> 03:10:29,360
Appreciate you and Teddy Alice.

6277
03:10:29,480 --> 03:10:30,313
Ladies and gentlemen.

6278
03:10:38,160 --> 03:10:38,250
Hm.
