1
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:03,960
Four three,

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,153
two,

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:05,993
one.

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:08,810
And we're live teddy atlas.

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,680
Thanks for being here man.

6
00:00:09,681 --> 00:00:10,520
I really appreciate it.

7
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,310
My Dad keeps saying that.

8
00:00:13,311 --> 00:00:17,330
Stop make you guys listen to
anyone out there mad at you.

9
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:18,470
No one's mad at anything.

10
00:00:18,471 --> 00:00:19,910
There's no real set time.

11
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:20,610
You know,

12
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:21,111
I can't,

13
00:00:21,111 --> 00:00:21,680
I got to tell you,

14
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,510
since I announced you're
going to be on the podcast,

15
00:00:23,511 --> 00:00:25,490
I had about a hundred people
tell me to get you mad.

16
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,691
They want you to rent,

17
00:00:26,691 --> 00:00:27,524
get scraped.

18
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:28,903
Every sunset,

19
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,910
we're firemen speech
you gave to Tim Bradley.

20
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,100
Everybody wants you to
start screaming to get mad.

21
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:34,401
You get,

22
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:35,450
you get people hyped up.

23
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,340
Believe there is only an occasion flood.

24
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:41,620
And I don't think there'll be an occasion.

25
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:42,610
Um,

26
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:43,400
I,

27
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,860
I'm looking at this stuff here.

28
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,390
You've got a nice place here by the way.

29
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:46,990
Thank you.

30
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:50,500
And it's making me think about
the Denzel Washington movie.

31
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:51,430
Uh,

32
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:52,410
the equalizer,

33
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,460
the first one where it was
in with those Russian guys.

34
00:00:55,461 --> 00:00:56,830
So were like messed up guys.

35
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,920
And he was trying to
protect that girl and he,

36
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,120
he started pointing,

37
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,850
there were skulls and
stuff at the guy's desk,

38
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:04,720
you know,

39
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,553
and uh,

40
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,770
he was pointing the stuff he was
trying to explain to the guy,

41
00:01:08,771 --> 00:01:09,170
listen,

42
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,240
let this girl go,

43
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:10,991
you know,

44
00:01:10,991 --> 00:01:12,430
I'll give you $9,000.

45
00:01:12,431 --> 00:01:13,840
Whatever was let her go.

46
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,520
She was like 15 years old.

47
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,301
And,

48
00:01:16,301 --> 00:01:17,020
um,

49
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:17,380
he,

50
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:18,610
he didn't want to listen to him.

51
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:22,660
And so he started the head
stuff like this with the skull.

52
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,130
I don't know if the people could see it,

53
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:25,240
but um,

54
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,400
and he started pointing
it towards him and I,

55
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:28,960
the guy didn't like take the hint,

56
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:29,291
you know,

57
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:30,010
the guy.

58
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:33,100
Then a couple of minutes later
he killed everybody in the room,

59
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,470
but it's just,

60
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:40,560
it looks exactly like the thing from
that movie to Denzel Washington where he,

61
00:01:41,561 --> 00:01:42,394
uh,

62
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:44,560
he also had guns and stairs right there.

63
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:45,270
There's a scene.

64
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,770
This is Jamie pulled the scene.

65
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,470
Oh really?

66
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:48,303
He was fair.

67
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,150
I never saw that movie.

68
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:49,391
Yeah.

69
00:01:49,391 --> 00:01:53,950
So you see like it's a scene
where he starts pointing,

70
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,230
they might've taken this from here.

71
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:56,651
I mean,

72
00:01:56,651 --> 00:01:58,030
they could've gotten it from us,

73
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,350
from Mexico who props.

74
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:00,483
Um,

75
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,150
so they,

76
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:01,940
they pointed,

77
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:06,310
he pointed at all towards the guy to kind
of warn the guy what was coming next.

78
00:02:06,311 --> 00:02:07,144
But

79
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:11,910
that's probably the only good movie that
ever came out of a terrible TV series.

80
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,710
You remember the TV series?

81
00:02:13,711 --> 00:02:14,544
The equalizer?

82
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,560
I remember the name,

83
00:02:16,561 --> 00:02:18,210
but I don't know that I ever really

84
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,170
watched it.

85
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,100
I was a fat,

86
00:02:20,101 --> 00:02:23,850
sloppy white guy driving a Jaguar that's
supposedly kicked everybody's ass and

87
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:24,750
you'd watch it and you know,

88
00:02:24,751 --> 00:02:27,270
get the fuck out of here with this movie.

89
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,253
I didn't watch it.

90
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,750
I heard a TV show.

91
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:33,390
It was a just a dumb TV show
that didn't make any sense.

92
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,870
And when they turned it into a movie
and had Denzel Washington in it and I'm

93
00:02:36,871 --> 00:02:37,150
like,

94
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:37,830
what?

95
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:38,760
How is this possible?

96
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,370
Because he freaking out.

97
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,211
Not really,

98
00:02:42,211 --> 00:02:42,870
but like,

99
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,030
I was just thinking about that then.

100
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,350
So listen man,

101
00:02:49,351 --> 00:02:49,830
you were,

102
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,650
you just came back from
the Canelo triple g fight,

103
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,300
which was a phenomenal fight.

104
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,620
That was a phenomenal fight.

105
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,920
I really enjoyed that fight a lot.

106
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:57,140
We'll

107
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,830
exaggerate how good fights nowadays.

108
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:00,071
Like,

109
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:00,904
if they're around,

110
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,750
everything's great.

111
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:03,243
Everything.

112
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,350
If a pitcher has one
good year in baseball,

113
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,260
he's great and he's,

114
00:03:06,261 --> 00:03:07,990
he's like the next Sandy Colfax.

115
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:11,380
Like people don't wait to see and,

116
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:14,170
and truly graded,

117
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,430
uh,

118
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:18,250
against things that were
out of their IRA because,

119
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:18,730
you know,

120
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,450
we're human.

121
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:19,990
Like,

122
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,823
Hey,

123
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:21,820
I was there.

124
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,080
I reported on it.

125
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,970
It's the greatest fight ever.

126
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,440
And No,

127
00:03:26,441 --> 00:03:26,621
no,

128
00:03:26,621 --> 00:03:28,690
but that's what people
will do what they do.

129
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,670
I think it was a really good fight,

130
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,190
but everything's relative,

131
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:33,940
you know,

132
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:38,940
and it depends on
everything is influenced.

133
00:03:38,951 --> 00:03:40,870
The judgment of people is influenced,

134
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:46,140
at least how I see it in my field
for whatever that's worth by.

135
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,940
What's around and how long were they are?

136
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:52,600
Like everybody bought to Pacquiao,

137
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:55,480
Mayweather first fight
because the fans were hungry.

138
00:03:55,481 --> 00:03:56,770
Their imagination was like,

139
00:03:56,771 --> 00:03:57,640
there's no good fights.

140
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:58,930
There's going to be a good fight.

141
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,190
So they'll,

142
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,020
they're anticipating it.

143
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,490
So you got them at the right time.

144
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,190
If it was the 80s and you had Lenin Duran,

145
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:09,460
porno would've gone Hagler Hagler uh,

146
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,313
you know,

147
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:10,961
you had,

148
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:11,620
um,

149
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,453
Hearns,

150
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,210
I mean,

151
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,610
you had all these great fight.

152
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,573
Aaron Pryor,

153
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,320
he had all these guys fighting each other.

154
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:21,520
You probably couldn't have
pulled off the Mayweather

155
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:27,070
Pacquiao thing that you pulled
off and it turns out to be,

156
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:27,731
you know,

157
00:04:27,731 --> 00:04:27,981
a,

158
00:04:27,981 --> 00:04:28,814
a bit of a,

159
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,130
I don't want to say scam,

160
00:04:30,131 --> 00:04:34,990
but it definitely wasn't what it lived
up to be because back Ya'll came into the

161
00:04:34,991 --> 00:04:35,824
fight injured.

162
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:36,910
I don't believe it.

163
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,090
I never saw any listener.

164
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,390
I'm going to tell you
needed to have an injury,

165
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,770
but you,

166
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,900
you're in a tough position.

167
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:48,080
You wouldn't taekwondo and all that kind
of fighting stuff in Lma and whatever

168
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,721
part of it.

169
00:04:49,721 --> 00:04:54,650
I'm probably not giving it a proper
understanding of what it was and,

170
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,890
and exactly what part of the fighting,

171
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,551
not just my,

172
00:04:57,551 --> 00:04:58,810
maybe I'm being too broad,

173
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,550
but I know you did taekwondo,

174
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:01,690
you did kickboxing.

175
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,860
I know that you're,

176
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,350
you are national champion
when you were young.

177
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,820
Somebody show me some more about it.

178
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,073
So,

179
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,370
um,

180
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,560
you,

181
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,190
you do things when you're injured.

182
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,870
I mean like when are you not injured?

183
00:05:13,871 --> 00:05:14,410
If you're,

184
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:15,490
if you're a football player,

185
00:05:15,491 --> 00:05:16,081
if you're a fighter,

186
00:05:16,081 --> 00:05:17,190
if you're in the contact button,

187
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,740
tell me when you're not in jail,

188
00:05:18,741 --> 00:05:19,930
like when there's not something wrong.

189
00:05:19,931 --> 00:05:24,931
So I never saw proof during that bout
I was there covering it for ESPN.

190
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,840
I never saw proof where he went store or
he didn't fold that hand or he threw it

191
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:32,614
in a,

192
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,710
in a poor way or in a,

193
00:05:34,711 --> 00:05:36,790
in a less than high level way.

194
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,290
I never saw that.

195
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:38,860
So listen,

196
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:39,820
I'm not in his body.

197
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:40,840
Uh,

198
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,380
you know,

199
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:41,831
and,

200
00:05:41,831 --> 00:05:42,664
and um,

201
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,660
I'm not a mind reader,

202
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,180
but I didn't see it.

203
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,740
But what I did see,

204
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:52,741
I saw him in his trainer in the runway
was more telling to me taking selfies

205
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,400
because they had got paid a few extra
dollars to promote some kind of product

206
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,930
where the selfies were attached to it.

207
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,220
So I saw that,

208
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:08,870
to me that was more debilitating to see
a guy before the biggest fight of his

209
00:06:08,871 --> 00:06:13,850
life where people were going crazy and
going to break the paper view record and

210
00:06:13,851 --> 00:06:15,590
paying $100 for the freaking thing,

211
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:21,350
to see him taking a selfie when the
mentalities should be in a different place

212
00:06:21,351 --> 00:06:25,430
and normally is in a different place
before you're about to walk that hundred

213
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,710
yards to the ring where you
might not come out of there,

214
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,270
it's always possible.

215
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,680
You have to have that mentality.

216
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:35,920
I thought that was more debilitating
than anything I saw physically with what

217
00:06:35,931 --> 00:06:37,430
was supposed to be an arm injury.

218
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,770
So to me,

219
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:40,611
look,

220
00:06:40,611 --> 00:06:41,444
to me,

221
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,433
maybe it's,

222
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,930
I don't know if it's fair
to say was a money grab,

223
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,370
but obviously it was
a bit of a money grab.

224
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:50,001
Ah,

225
00:06:50,001 --> 00:06:51,440
they were beyond themselves.

226
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,430
Uh,

227
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:52,731
you know,

228
00:06:52,731 --> 00:06:53,840
one guy was retired,

229
00:06:53,841 --> 00:06:54,830
he came back forward.

230
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:58,220
They were beyond the peak of
their abilities in their career.

231
00:06:58,730 --> 00:06:59,690
And I just,

232
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,760
I just didn't see,

233
00:07:01,761 --> 00:07:02,594
uh,

234
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,140
I,

235
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,280
I didn't see that fight.

236
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:05,543
Uh,

237
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:06,980
the purpose to it.

238
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,221
Well,

239
00:07:07,221 --> 00:07:08,750
it happened about five,

240
00:07:08,751 --> 00:07:09,620
six years late.

241
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:10,850
Yeah.

242
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:11,683
Yeah.

243
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:13,610
I just,

244
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:15,853
I mean,

245
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:17,561
what,

246
00:07:17,561 --> 00:07:19,370
what I,

247
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,773
I you,

248
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,310
everyone who gets in the ring,

249
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:24,260
they deserve to make as
much money as they can.

250
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,700
I never,

251
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,690
I never say that a fighter got overpaid.

252
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,130
Never.

253
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:28,963
I don't care.

254
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:33,440
I never say that because I understand
what it took to get to that point and,

255
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,240
but you know,

256
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,133
you can,

257
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,390
you can play with things and you know,

258
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,253
you can,

259
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,020
you can kind of lead people to things.

260
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,610
And again,

261
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,860
where we started with this conversation,

262
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:46,900
you know,

263
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,120
it,

264
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,660
it's the time you are around the,

265
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,503
the environment.

266
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,400
What's not around,

267
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,560
not just what's around
but what's not around,

268
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,480
you know,

269
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,920
not that many great fights
to be made right now.

270
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,580
So what you're saying,

271
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:02,900
so in triple g Canelo fight is important
because there's not a lot of guys

272
00:08:02,901 --> 00:08:03,830
waiting in the wings.

273
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:08,220
It's not like the old days of the 1980s
are the glory days of the welterweight

274
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,110
in the middleweight division.

275
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:09,831
No,

276
00:08:09,831 --> 00:08:10,664
it's not.

277
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:11,990
And the people,

278
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:12,441
you know,

279
00:08:12,441 --> 00:08:12,601
they,

280
00:08:12,601 --> 00:08:13,760
they have a thirst,

281
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:14,594
if you will,

282
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:20,030
to see something that the
PR department can bring.

283
00:08:20,031 --> 00:08:23,030
It can use the right
material because they,

284
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:27,860
it has to be fighters that obviously a
marquee fighters with a name that they

285
00:08:27,861 --> 00:08:30,560
can build it and get the
imagination of the people to say,

286
00:08:30,561 --> 00:08:31,520
this is going to be a great one.

287
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:35,960
So when they see it and
they pay $100 on $85 or $95,

288
00:08:35,961 --> 00:08:37,110
whatever the heck they're playing,

289
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,300
um,

290
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,420
for the fight and then it's a good fight,

291
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:45,380
well becomes a great fight
because of all those elements.

292
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,210
Because uh,

293
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,073
you know,

294
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:50,390
it's during your time you saw it,

295
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,070
you committed to it,

296
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,800
you sacrifice to pay that money,

297
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,290
you sacrifice a fly there and yeah,

298
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,840
it's a really good fight,

299
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:05,220
becomes a iconic and,

300
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,400
and I don't think we
separate that in our minds.

301
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,233
I don't think,

302
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,690
hey,

303
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:11,880
who says we have to,

304
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,340
because right.

305
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,550
It's about enjoyment.

306
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:15,450
So if that,

307
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:16,920
if that makes people happy,

308
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,970
hey,

309
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:18,900
that's part of,

310
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:22,230
that's part of what goes into
the mix of entertainment.

311
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:27,000
But I didn't see it when I tried to
separate that being in the business.

312
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,410
I didn't see it as,

313
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:28,801
you know,

314
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:29,820
the Thrilla in Manila,

315
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:30,390
I used,

316
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:35,390
I saw it as a really good solid
fight and they once again,

317
00:09:35,881 --> 00:09:37,530
unfortunately it took away from it.

318
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,840
We'd controversial with the decision.

319
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,900
Did you think that I thought
the first decision was terrible.

320
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,730
I thought triple g clearly won the fight.

321
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,860
I thought the second
decision was arguable.

322
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:47,330
I started like,

323
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:47,670
this is,

324
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,720
this looks like a draw to me.

325
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,250
And it was an amazing fight.

326
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,031
I mean,

327
00:09:51,031 --> 00:09:53,280
I gotta be honest because I mean,

328
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,390
that's what you're supposed to be.

329
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,620
And who do you think one?

330
00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:00,710
I added one 17 one 12 and a lot of people
going to say for you had to too fall.

331
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,050
I tried to pull off all week long.

332
00:10:04,051 --> 00:10:06,060
I picked Canelo to win on ESPN,

333
00:10:06,061 --> 00:10:06,651
on sports center.

334
00:10:06,651 --> 00:10:07,484
I was working.

335
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,960
So I mean,

336
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:11,893
12 is big.

337
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,021
It's five rounds.

338
00:10:13,021 --> 00:10:14,060
So I,

339
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:14,461
yeah,

340
00:10:14,461 --> 00:10:14,731
so,

341
00:10:14,731 --> 00:10:15,210
um,

342
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,043
you know,

343
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:16,711
you,

344
00:10:16,711 --> 00:10:17,040
you,

345
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,970
you start to,

346
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:20,041
you're human.

347
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,220
You start to hear people's,

348
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:21,760
like you,

349
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,180
you know,

350
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,810
that knows something about
fighting that has had the closest.

351
00:10:24,811 --> 00:10:25,620
So you're,

352
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,600
maybe you don't want to
yell at Yaddo one 17,

353
00:10:27,601 --> 00:10:28,021
one 12.

354
00:10:28,021 --> 00:10:28,470
But yeah,

355
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,960
you still got to yell at
because that's what you believe.

356
00:10:30,961 --> 00:10:31,794
That's what you saw.

357
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,650
And I still say it,

358
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,060
I still yell at that.

359
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:37,403
It was,

360
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,180
they didn't give him credit for gems.

361
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:40,470
Like jabs don't count no more.

362
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,633
Like

363
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:48,020
I'm not going to pick out anybody because
that's not really fair to do when you

364
00:10:49,051 --> 00:10:50,910
have a podium and they
don't have a podium.

365
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,013
But

366
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,080
sometimes it is because they deserve it,

367
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,960
but not generally.

368
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,530
And the judges nowadays,

369
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,450
I think that

370
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,290
they just give it,

371
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:12,030
I see too often that they
almost go down the easy route.

372
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,280
Like you know,

373
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:18,240
they just give it to who's
aggressive for guys walking forward.

374
00:11:18,241 --> 00:11:19,320
A guy's Tom Punches,

375
00:11:19,321 --> 00:11:21,010
it's like their favor now.

376
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:21,540
Chi.

377
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,830
And it's more to it than that.

378
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,380
And I understand that the
sport doesn't help itself.

379
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:27,720
They don't make a clear criteria for,

380
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:29,940
but it's supposed to be clean,

381
00:11:29,941 --> 00:11:34,710
harder affective punches because the
separation of professional boxing,

382
00:11:34,711 --> 00:11:37,080
an amateur boxing is you have to sell it,

383
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:40,230
you have to make money and you've
got to put fannies in the seats.

384
00:11:40,231 --> 00:11:42,750
So you want to see guys get hurt.

385
00:11:42,751 --> 00:11:44,370
You want to see guys in pack guys.

386
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,530
So it's the cleaner
who hurts the guy more.

387
00:11:46,531 --> 00:11:47,161
It's the cleaner,

388
00:11:47,161 --> 00:11:48,870
more impactful punches,

389
00:11:48,871 --> 00:11:49,970
but it's not just thrown in.

390
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:54,400
It's not just to Gretchen because
the Gretchen has to lead to something

391
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:57,070
affective affective aggression.

392
00:11:57,071 --> 00:12:02,071
So I I saw for me to get it to that
one 17 one 12 I saw Goliath skin on the

393
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:08,980
outside controlling rains,

394
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,210
controlling distance.

395
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:14,410
You want to use that silly word ring
generalship cause I have to time,

396
00:12:14,411 --> 00:12:15,520
I don't know what they're talking about.

397
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,600
They say ring general.

398
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,730
Like what?

399
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,611
What are you talking about?

400
00:12:18,611 --> 00:12:20,020
I just saw the way you judged it.

401
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:20,480
Where,

402
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:20,950
where did,

403
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:25,510
where did you fit in ring generalship
into that into your thinking because I'd

404
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:30,460
like to know but if it is ring
generalship he was controlling range.

405
00:12:30,461 --> 00:12:31,540
He was controlling outside.

406
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:34,120
He was keeping the shorter
man on the outside,

407
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,410
catching him with a jab,

408
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,970
making him earn his way in,

409
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,250
making them pay a price to get in.

410
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:44,320
Now was the other guy can lob and the
other guy landing the hard clean body

411
00:12:44,321 --> 00:12:46,480
shots that sometimes you
don't get credit for?

412
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:46,871
Yeah,

413
00:12:46,871 --> 00:12:47,704
he was all,

414
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,240
like I say on ESPN,

415
00:12:49,241 --> 00:12:50,740
he was putting water in the basement.

416
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,340
Yeah,

417
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,270
he definitely was.

418
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,600
But the Jeb didn't count suddenly was
suddenly in a universe where the jab of a

419
00:12:59,711 --> 00:13:01,000
guy doesn't mean anything.

420
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,710
When we don't want it to mean anything.

421
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,770
When we want to give it to
the aggressive guy to the,

422
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:06,980
to the guy trying,

423
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:07,601
you know,

424
00:13:07,601 --> 00:13:08,620
trying to get in there.

425
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,500
The question is what,

426
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,280
what's more important is a jab or
important or a hook to the body.

427
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,410
What is more important
in your rock to the body?

428
00:13:14,411 --> 00:13:15,370
Clean is more important,

429
00:13:15,371 --> 00:13:15,881
more important.

430
00:13:15,881 --> 00:13:20,881
But if the j about numbers to hook
to the body through many rounds and,

431
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:24,760
and the numbers are significant
that it's greater than,

432
00:13:24,761 --> 00:13:27,610
then you have to account for that.

433
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,001
Right.

434
00:13:28,001 --> 00:13:29,560
So you think that people are watching,

435
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:33,130
they're watching a couple of jabs and
then one hook to the body and they count

436
00:13:33,131 --> 00:13:35,160
that one hook to the body
better than the count to chat.

437
00:13:35,161 --> 00:13:35,470
Yeah.

438
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:39,280
And I don't have a problem
with that because our counted
that way till if it's a

439
00:13:39,281 --> 00:13:41,260
good shot because again,

440
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,423
a power shot.

441
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:43,091
Yeah.

442
00:13:43,091 --> 00:13:45,760
Because that is what's going
to drive people to the event,

443
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:48,370
right to the sport is a harder punches.

444
00:13:48,371 --> 00:13:49,630
So I have no problem with that.

445
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:54,840
But if the jabs or 20 jabs
and it's two body punches,

446
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,530
well then I'm starting to save.

447
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:01,770
We can't forget the jabs because the
body punches got your attention and,

448
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,010
and it,

449
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:04,003
you know,

450
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,520
move Johnny his seat a little bit.

451
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,740
Maybe because for whatever reason.

452
00:14:08,741 --> 00:14:13,741
So I'm just saying that the
criteria is not clean enough,

453
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:15,340
uh,

454
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:15,800
for,

455
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,130
for the judges sometimes

456
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:20,740
well to be even bigger mass and MMA
and it's a lot of the same judges.

457
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,050
I,

458
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:21,341
you mean,

459
00:14:21,341 --> 00:14:24,490
I think the problem with judging
is it the same in both sports.

460
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,010
You should have someone who
has experienced in the sport.

461
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:27,610
I mean,

462
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:30,700
they have to have a deep understanding
of what they're actually watching.

463
00:14:30,701 --> 00:14:31,750
And that's not the case.

464
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:35,350
I know it's not the case in boxing because
I know a lot of the same judges from

465
00:14:35,351 --> 00:14:37,060
boxing also judge MMA.

466
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,890
They don't know what they're
talking about in MMA.

467
00:14:38,891 --> 00:14:41,110
And I don't think they know what
they're talking about unboxing either.

468
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,210
And that's a real travesty.

469
00:14:43,211 --> 00:14:47,290
It's a huge disservice to these
professional athletes who literally are,

470
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,124
as you said,

471
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:49,420
risking everything.

472
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:50,320
As they step in there,

473
00:14:50,321 --> 00:14:53,180
there's a real good chance
that they might not come out.

474
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:53,511
I mean,

475
00:14:53,511 --> 00:14:55,910
it happens every so many fights,

476
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:56,870
a guy dies.

477
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:57,980
This is just a fact.

478
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:00,950
And boxing and football too.

479
00:15:00,951 --> 00:15:01,490
Sure.

480
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:02,420
And MMA as well.

481
00:15:02,421 --> 00:15:02,601
We'll,

482
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:04,550
MMA has plenty of problems.

483
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,061
You know what I mean?

484
00:15:05,061 --> 00:15:05,300
There's,

485
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,920
there's less deaths in MMA,

486
00:15:06,921 --> 00:15:09,040
but we're getting deaths from Wayans.

487
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,261
You know,

488
00:15:09,261 --> 00:15:12,260
we have a lot of extreme weight
cutting issues and some of the small

489
00:15:12,261 --> 00:15:13,490
organizations in particular,

490
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,690
all of that stuff is legitimate.

491
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,753
It's a problem.

492
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,030
Something that should be looked at.

493
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:22,170
It's just a shame that the judging is
so poor and it's been this way for so

494
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:22,900
long.

495
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:23,733
Well,

496
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:24,820
to the boxing,

497
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:25,901
I mean,

498
00:15:25,901 --> 00:15:26,734
you have a,

499
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:27,311
then,

500
00:15:27,311 --> 00:15:29,110
I'm not saying this in a derogatory way.

501
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:30,970
In some ways it's a good way,

502
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,590
but you have a dictator running,

503
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:33,590
you know,

504
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,890
UFC and no,

505
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,141
but,

506
00:15:35,141 --> 00:15:40,141
but it's okay to have a dictator sometimes
because at least you have rules that

507
00:15:40,601 --> 00:15:40,760
are,

508
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,530
he had to have structure and uh,

509
00:15:44,531 --> 00:15:44,891
you know,

510
00:15:44,891 --> 00:15:47,730
as long as they're not taking
people out and killing them.

511
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,790
I know what you're saying.

512
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:53,790
And so boxing has boxing.

513
00:15:54,251 --> 00:15:55,780
He has no real

514
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:57,941
accountability,

515
00:15:57,941 --> 00:15:59,380
no structure across the board.

516
00:15:59,381 --> 00:15:59,681
No,

517
00:15:59,681 --> 00:16:00,514
you don't real,

518
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,020
you know,

519
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:05,410
lateral structure and conformity,

520
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:10,330
not done unilateral because you have
different states that have different

521
00:16:10,331 --> 00:16:11,680
commissions and you know,

522
00:16:11,681 --> 00:16:13,090
they're supposed to be tied together,

523
00:16:13,091 --> 00:16:16,720
but they all act differently and
there's no national commission.

524
00:16:16,721 --> 00:16:17,471
There's no body,

525
00:16:17,471 --> 00:16:18,610
there's no dictated.

526
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:19,421
There's no czar,

527
00:16:19,421 --> 00:16:20,680
there's no it,

528
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,270
there's no NBA commissioner,

529
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,650
there's no NFL commissioner,

530
00:16:23,651 --> 00:16:27,910
there's no MLB commissioner that
overlooks and polices the whole sport.

531
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,253
And

532
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:32,170
there's those separation of

533
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,570
church and state,

534
00:16:34,571 --> 00:16:35,171
so to speak,

535
00:16:35,171 --> 00:16:39,100
where the people making the
money in the sport are separated,

536
00:16:39,101 --> 00:16:42,640
truly separated from the people
supposedly administrating this.

537
00:16:42,641 --> 00:16:44,460
But there's no separation there.

538
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:45,130
I mean,

539
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:50,130
promoters actually that are making the
money and have obviously a horse that

540
00:16:50,861 --> 00:16:51,581
running in the game,

541
00:16:51,581 --> 00:16:52,630
so to speak that night,

542
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:53,743
uh,

543
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:54,520
that they won,

544
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,540
that fight it to when they pay the judges.

545
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,970
And there's no,

546
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,050
there's no,

547
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:02,471
again,

548
00:17:02,471 --> 00:17:03,251
there's no buffer.

549
00:17:03,251 --> 00:17:08,251
There's no separation where you can
have promoters and managers that can

550
00:17:08,591 --> 00:17:10,930
actually go to the commission and say,

551
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,000
we don't want these judges to judge.

552
00:17:13,001 --> 00:17:13,661
They can't say,

553
00:17:13,661 --> 00:17:14,650
put this judge and,

554
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:17,770
but they can knock judge
his out and in commissions.

555
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:18,604
We'll listen to them.

556
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:19,540
Uh,

557
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,220
the alphabet organizations,

558
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,083
they're corrupt.

559
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:23,003
Um,

560
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,430
they are,

561
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,120
I mean,

562
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,470
it's not teddy atlas saying it.

563
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:29,170
It's everybody saying that there's very
few people who are going to say they're

564
00:17:29,171 --> 00:17:30,004
not corrupt,

565
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:30,500
corrupt.

566
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:30,701
I mean,

567
00:17:30,701 --> 00:17:32,140
if you're going to be honest
about it and you're not,

568
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:35,170
and you don't have an agenda where you're
afraid to say it because you have an

569
00:17:35,171 --> 00:17:35,770
agenda,

570
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,600
which a lot of people do in my business,

571
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,411
they have agenda.

572
00:17:38,411 --> 00:17:39,210
So then I'm going to say,

573
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:39,640
dude,

574
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,570
because they're part of it.

575
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,920
If they're not part of it,

576
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:42,890
uh,

577
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:43,723
they're,

578
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,970
they're friendly with
people that are part of it.

579
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:46,540
And,

580
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,090
uh,

581
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:48,010
they want to have access,

582
00:17:48,011 --> 00:17:49,180
they want to have relationships,

583
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,520
they say away from it.

584
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:50,940
And,

585
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,660
and they understand how the culture
should work so they understand,

586
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:55,021
uh,

587
00:17:55,021 --> 00:17:55,441
you know,

588
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:55,920
is it,

589
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,680
is it a smoky room with
cigars like the old days?

590
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,071
Well,

591
00:17:59,071 --> 00:18:01,050
Frankie Carbo was one of the things,

592
00:18:01,051 --> 00:18:01,890
and you put an anvil,

593
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:02,401
no,

594
00:18:02,401 --> 00:18:03,234
it's not that,

595
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:08,360
but you might be paying
$30,000 for an ad and,

596
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:08,740
and,

597
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,321
and uh,

598
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:14,321
at a convention for the WBA or
the WBC or the w IBM for Wbl,

599
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:16,500
whatever the heck they are.

600
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,060
And you might be paying
30,000 foot and what,

601
00:18:19,061 --> 00:18:20,310
what you,

602
00:18:20,311 --> 00:18:20,641
you know,

603
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,080
why you paid the 30,000 for that?

604
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,060
I don't think that you just like to see,

605
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:24,990
um,

606
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,750
your name and add in a,

607
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,630
in a brochure.

608
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:28,650
There's,

609
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,550
there was a purpose
behind paying that had.

610
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:31,823
And um,

611
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,540
so there's no,

612
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,153
again,

613
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,530
okay,

614
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:41,530
you have the administrators have to sport
the commissions and then you have to

615
00:18:42,231 --> 00:18:47,231
alphabet organizations that get paid
a sanction and free from the champion.

616
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,090
So they want that champion to win.

617
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,310
And so they get to sanction fee.

618
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,460
And especially if he's a popular champion.

619
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:56,840
So the,

620
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,100
so now you have

621
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,790
no body saying,

622
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:05,610
well the manager can't talk to the
sanction organization for modern can't.

623
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:07,670
Of course they can talk to them and say,

624
00:19:07,671 --> 00:19:08,990
I want my guys rated high.

625
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,120
Of course they have access.

626
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,620
So they have access to
talking to somebody,

627
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:18,590
influencing somebody to move
their guy up in the ratings,

628
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:24,130
these honest ratings and they have
access to telling an organization,

629
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:25,460
well I,

630
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:25,761
you know,

631
00:19:25,761 --> 00:19:28,460
I'd like to push a mandatory,

632
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,100
I like to push my guy
to get the mandatory,

633
00:19:31,101 --> 00:19:31,970
which means of course,

634
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:34,730
that he's got to fight them
within a certain period of time.

635
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:35,990
He's got to fight to champion.

636
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,400
That was missing in MMA.

637
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:37,880
Yeah,

638
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,900
that's absolutely missing.

639
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,880
So you have all that stuff going on

640
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,150
and where,

641
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,063
where,

642
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:46,880
where's the,

643
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,673
where's the,

644
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:49,850
where's the oversight?

645
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,091
Yeah.

646
00:19:50,091 --> 00:19:50,671
Where's all of us?

647
00:19:50,671 --> 00:19:51,950
I was the police in wisdom.

648
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:52,640
Right?

649
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,620
Where's the line where,

650
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,601
because again,

651
00:19:56,601 --> 00:19:57,650
people making money,

652
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,360
people running the sport,

653
00:19:59,361 --> 00:20:00,290
people making money,

654
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,970
people administrating the sport.

655
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,950
It's not supposed to blur a,

656
00:20:03,951 --> 00:20:08,951
there's supposed to be a separation now
if you know where to go in Europe or

657
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,590
America or United States too,

658
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,610
but all to Europe where there's
a lot of big fights too.

659
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,240
It's just a big fight with Joshua,

660
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:17,930
uh,

661
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:18,561
in London,

662
00:20:18,561 --> 00:20:20,060
knee drew 90,000 people,

663
00:20:20,061 --> 00:20:21,410
which is good for the sport and it's,

664
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:21,891
it's,

665
00:20:21,891 --> 00:20:22,760
it's incredible.

666
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:23,780
Um,

667
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:28,780
but if you know what restaurant
to go to tonight before big fight,

668
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:31,640
you will walk in a restaurant.

669
00:20:31,641 --> 00:20:32,474
I've been there,

670
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,700
you will walk in a restaurant.

671
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:40,090
I'm not going to say something and if I
can't stand behind it and you will see

672
00:20:40,761 --> 00:20:41,600
at the restaurant,

673
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:44,030
it's all big table kind of like,

674
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:44,780
you know,

675
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:45,650
not the last supper,

676
00:20:45,651 --> 00:20:46,111
but it's,

677
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:51,111
it's a big table and you will see all the
officials at that table that are going

678
00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:52,630
to work to fight the next night.

679
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,610
And you will see the organizational heads,

680
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,920
the heads of that sanctioning body.

681
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,490
And,

682
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,950
and the guys are in charge.

683
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,561
The presidents,

684
00:20:59,561 --> 00:21:00,460
vice presidents,

685
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:01,330
um,

686
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:03,550
supervisors are judges,

687
00:21:03,551 --> 00:21:06,730
referees and guess who
the host of the dinners,

688
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,013
the promoter.

689
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,040
Some more with that.

690
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:10,541
I mean,

691
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,160
is something greatly wrong with that?

692
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,400
So the host of the dead end,

693
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,910
it's a big bill obviously.

694
00:21:15,911 --> 00:21:16,810
I mean it's a lot of people.

695
00:21:16,811 --> 00:21:17,770
It's a good restaurant.

696
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:19,570
The eating all the best of drinking,

697
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:21,040
the best wines and everything else.

698
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:26,280
So it's a big bill and it's being picked
up by the promoter who wants a specific

699
00:21:28,571 --> 00:21:30,910
fight to win that night and he's got all,

700
00:21:30,911 --> 00:21:35,911
he's got access to all the judges or the
officials or the organizational heads

701
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:37,931
now.

702
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:42,400
So I would say to the people that
are listening out there that,

703
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,120
just to make the analogy dead really I
think would hit home the New York Yankees

704
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:54,490
there obviously your universally known,

705
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:59,910
Our Name and brand sort of organization
maybe the biggest of all time.

706
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:04,960
So how about in New York?

707
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:09,880
You go to the best restaurant and
a night before a world series game,

708
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:15,010
you walked into the restaurant and
you saw all the umpiring cruel,

709
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:19,780
all the officials that are in charge of
the umpiring for the world series game,

710
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:23,380
sitting at a dinner hosted
by the Steinbrenner's

711
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,500
problem.

712
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,131
Problem,

713
00:22:25,131 --> 00:22:25,761
problem,

714
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:26,594
problem.

715
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,920
Giant problem.

716
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:28,783
Yeah.

717
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:33,600
And it can't happen because there's a
commission would never let that happen

718
00:22:33,601 --> 00:22:34,800
because the integrity,

719
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,700
the credibility of Dysport would be
down the tubes in one moment before you

720
00:22:38,701 --> 00:22:40,350
could finish his shrimp cocktail.

721
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,290
And so it can't happen.

722
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,860
It happens on checked in box

723
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,530
thins all the time in boxing.

724
00:22:47,531 --> 00:22:52,330
And just the look of impropriety is wrong.

725
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,220
It should be wrong.

726
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:54,441
It,

727
00:22:54,441 --> 00:22:55,151
it should be wrong.

728
00:22:55,151 --> 00:22:55,984
A baseball,

729
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:58,270
it should be wrong and
football should be wrong in MB,

730
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:02,800
but it should be even more wrong in
a sport where you risked so much.

731
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:03,770
Yeah,

732
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:03,951
no,

733
00:23:03,951 --> 00:23:04,784
I agree.

734
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:05,241
Yeah,

735
00:23:05,241 --> 00:23:05,661
it's a very,

736
00:23:05,661 --> 00:23:06,494
very good point.

737
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,300
And I don't know how
you would ever fix that.

738
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:08,541
I mean,

739
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:12,770
how would you have some
universal oversight of the
entire sport and how would

740
00:23:12,771 --> 00:23:15,590
you get everybody from the Wbo w you know,

741
00:23:15,591 --> 00:23:16,424
WBC,

742
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,780
cause they wouldn't,

743
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:17,961
no,

744
00:23:17,961 --> 00:23:18,081
no,

745
00:23:18,081 --> 00:23:18,441
they don't.

746
00:23:18,441 --> 00:23:22,250
Can have because the president of the
United States started Karen when there was

747
00:23:22,251 --> 00:23:23,330
a problem with baseball.

748
00:23:23,331 --> 00:23:23,810
He got,

749
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:24,643
he got involved.

750
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:26,120
That was about steroids though,

751
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:26,600
right?

752
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:26,841
Yeah.

753
00:23:26,841 --> 00:23:27,770
But it was a problem.

754
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,120
But wasn't that a horseshit problem?

755
00:23:29,121 --> 00:23:30,080
I mean it was a real problem.

756
00:23:30,081 --> 00:23:33,650
But it was more of a problem of they
wanted to clean up the image because it's

757
00:23:33,651 --> 00:23:38,651
America's sport and they had
these people that were the fence.

758
00:23:38,661 --> 00:23:40,550
We're going to leave
the game a little bit.

759
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:41,960
So it was a problem.

760
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,001
This is a problem.

761
00:23:43,001 --> 00:23:44,330
It was impacting them.

762
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:45,590
It was impacting,

763
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,370
loosen

764
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:50,180
w it was impacting the
perception of the game,

765
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:52,700
which impacted the,

766
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:54,813
the gates,

767
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,810
what they're gonna make.

768
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:59,660
And ultimately the fan base,

769
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:04,900
which of course impacts them financially
or it impacts the country because of

770
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,450
less people care about this sport.

771
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:09,290
Um,

772
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:11,450
you're going to see it less
and if you care about it,

773
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,550
you're going to be one of
the people that are left out.

774
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:19,030
So it was a problem and they can't,

775
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,420
I don't,

776
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,740
I'm going to be careful saying this,

777
00:24:21,741 --> 00:24:23,090
but not that careful,

778
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:24,330
but I,

779
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,700
because you have to say it,

780
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:30,170
I don't think that they care as
much about the people in boxing.

781
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,220
I don't think they do there.

782
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,113
I just,

783
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:32,560
it's,

784
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,130
it's more of a dangerous,

785
00:24:34,131 --> 00:24:35,510
dirty sport in their eyes.

786
00:24:35,511 --> 00:24:36,170
Yeah.

787
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:36,691
And,

788
00:24:36,691 --> 00:24:36,911
and,

789
00:24:36,911 --> 00:24:38,780
and the people that come
into it and everything else.

790
00:24:38,781 --> 00:24:41,690
How am I going to get into all the other
stuff that you could get into that,

791
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:42,340
you know,

792
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,960
so popular to get into
in some ways nowadays?

793
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,020
You mean like racism?

794
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:46,880
Yeah.

795
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,500
I'm not going to get into that because

796
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,430
I don't want to and I don't have,

797
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:53,240
you know,

798
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,030
definitive things to show for that.

799
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,500
I just know how I,

800
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:58,171
well,

801
00:24:58,171 --> 00:24:59,004
the precise,

802
00:24:59,420 --> 00:24:59,870
I just don't,

803
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:00,500
she supports,

804
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,333
it's not,

805
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:03,530
it's not cherished the
way baseball's cherish.

806
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:07,340
When is a big fight like Canelo and
triple g people get excited and a lot of

807
00:25:07,341 --> 00:25:08,174
people buy it,

808
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,560
but it's not necessarily thought of
as something that represents America.

809
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:14,240
And in particularly in Canelo triple g,

810
00:25:14,241 --> 00:25:16,310
you're talking about two people
that aren't American to begin with.

811
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:17,613
Yes.

812
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:18,100
Yeah.

813
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,780
And there's a history to boxing.

814
00:25:20,781 --> 00:25:20,981
No,

815
00:25:20,981 --> 00:25:22,810
that unfortunately,

816
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,051
you know,

817
00:25:23,051 --> 00:25:24,790
because I care about this
positive for my whole life.

818
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:25,953
Um,

819
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,133
that it's kind of,

820
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:29,170
yeah,

821
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:31,250
it's got a reputation
as being corrupt and,

822
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,680
and unfortunately,

823
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,480
fortunately and unfortunately,

824
00:25:34,481 --> 00:25:36,820
like there's a pod,

825
00:25:36,821 --> 00:25:39,740
the good part where the
history goes back longer,

826
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,290
farther than any other sport,

827
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,393
any other sport.

828
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:43,001
I mean,

829
00:25:43,001 --> 00:25:44,800
it was the first sport in the Olympics.

830
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:46,690
It goes back further.

831
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,970
And it was the biggest
sport in this country,

832
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:50,320
bigger than baseball.

833
00:25:50,321 --> 00:25:52,150
At one time it was that big.

834
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,140
I mean,

835
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:53,621
you know,

836
00:25:53,621 --> 00:25:57,160
so and now it's,

837
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:57,880
it's not,

838
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,580
and it,

839
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,230
it's too bad because,

840
00:26:02,231 --> 00:26:04,570
and it's too bad that the kids,

841
00:26:04,571 --> 00:26:05,920
that the younger people,

842
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:11,490
they don't have the ability
to learn about those fighters,

843
00:26:12,631 --> 00:26:13,870
those special fighters.

844
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:14,651
That was special.

845
00:26:14,651 --> 00:26:15,484
They really want,

846
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,200
and it was special for different reasons.

847
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:17,591
Like,

848
00:26:17,591 --> 00:26:19,060
like Jackie Robinson was special.

849
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:19,451
We know,

850
00:26:19,451 --> 00:26:21,340
we don't have to go
into why he was special,

851
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,890
but nobody knows that Joe Lewis,

852
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:25,960
who's quiet and everything,

853
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:29,140
but when he was in the army and it was,

854
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:29,591
you know,

855
00:26:29,591 --> 00:26:31,630
segregation and all that crap going on,

856
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:33,873
he,

857
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:39,120
he quietly used his position
as heavyweight champ of
the world to make sure that

858
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:43,060
when he went to movies and they,

859
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:47,040
him in the front row and he saw that
blacks weren't allowed to come in.

860
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:47,341
He said,

861
00:26:47,341 --> 00:26:49,320
I'm not going in there and
let's blacks can come in there.

862
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:54,800
When he went to other sort of events
where the same kind of junk was going on,

863
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:59,100
he very quietly but powerfully

864
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,730
integrated things and said,

865
00:27:02,731 --> 00:27:02,821
no,

866
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:03,810
I'm going to make a change here.

867
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:04,530
You,

868
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:05,520
you're not going to have me.

869
00:27:05,521 --> 00:27:08,550
And I'd have people that look like me,

870
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:09,601
you know,

871
00:27:09,601 --> 00:27:10,434
kept out.

872
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,060
So he,

873
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:15,900
and there were people I've read about
it because I like reading about those

874
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:16,680
things,

875
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,513
but history,

876
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,060
um,

877
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:20,670
to see how we could be better and then,

878
00:27:20,671 --> 00:27:21,300
um,

879
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,290
where we've come from.

880
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:26,550
And there were history of black families,

881
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,091
you know,

882
00:27:27,091 --> 00:27:27,921
poor black family,

883
00:27:27,921 --> 00:27:28,754
he said would,

884
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,140
would get hope from just saying,

885
00:27:31,141 --> 00:27:31,381
hey,

886
00:27:31,381 --> 00:27:32,214
Louis did it.

887
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,390
They would tell their kids,

888
00:27:33,391 --> 00:27:34,224
hey,

889
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:34,981
listen,

890
00:27:34,981 --> 00:27:36,000
I don't want to hear this.

891
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:36,901
I don't want to hear that.

892
00:27:36,901 --> 00:27:37,800
You can't do this.

893
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:38,910
Joe Louis did it.

894
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,070
And then so he was that important.

895
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:41,761
That's all,

896
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:43,170
that's the only point I'm making here.

897
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:48,500
He was that freaking important that
that history and the history of other

898
00:27:49,591 --> 00:27:50,460
fighters like him.

899
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,080
It doesn't have to be black fighters,

900
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:55,040
but that what they fought for,

901
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:55,861
what they did,

902
00:27:55,861 --> 00:27:56,730
what they overcame,

903
00:27:56,731 --> 00:27:57,660
where they came from,

904
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:58,890
who Benny Lennon.

905
00:27:59,190 --> 00:27:59,690
Um,

906
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:01,530
one of the greatest Jewish
fighters of all time.

907
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:02,850
It was a time when,

908
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:03,780
uh,

909
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:03,971
and,

910
00:28:03,971 --> 00:28:04,870
and it's still around,

911
00:28:04,871 --> 00:28:07,110
unfortunately there's
a lot of antisemitism,

912
00:28:07,111 --> 00:28:09,480
but there was a time where it,

913
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:09,811
you know,

914
00:28:09,811 --> 00:28:11,760
it was tough being a Jew and,

915
00:28:11,761 --> 00:28:12,690
and you're,

916
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,900
you're growing up and
he get caught or cake.

917
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,220
I don't know if I'm pronouncing right,

918
00:28:17,221 --> 00:28:19,590
I think it was right and you
get caught all those kinds of,

919
00:28:19,591 --> 00:28:20,850
I don't even know what the hell it means.

920
00:28:20,851 --> 00:28:22,800
I just know it's a bad name to call Joe.

921
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,053
And,

922
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:29,100
and you had all that
stuff going on and Jews,

923
00:28:29,101 --> 00:28:33,260
woman thought of being there were thought
of moving towards banking and then

924
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,020
they're moving towards
things will make them money.

925
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:37,110
And then later on they started doing that.

926
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:41,460
But they were the ghettos and they
were trying to pull themselves out.

927
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:43,200
And so at that era,

928
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,030
during that time to twenties to thirties,

929
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,200
the truth was some of the best fighters
because that was their way of getting

930
00:28:49,201 --> 00:28:49,740
out.

931
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,110
But there was other,

932
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:57,170
there was another significance to be in
a Jewish fighter that a lot of the kids,

933
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:01,570
their own thought of is bringing Tufts.

934
00:29:01,571 --> 00:29:03,170
So they got picked on and,

935
00:29:03,171 --> 00:29:07,050
and thought of that they're going to go
more towards academic and other stuff.

936
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:08,880
So there was a weakness.

937
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,710
Perceived not true.

938
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,370
None of this stuff is used for.

939
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:13,890
So yeah.

940
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:18,120
So now all of a sudden Benny
Leonard comes along when a sports,

941
00:29:18,121 --> 00:29:22,890
the biggest sport in the country and he's
the best freaking fighter in the game.

942
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:28,880
And he calmed his hair before he got in
the ring and he would come out without

943
00:29:30,481 --> 00:29:31,380
it being mast.

944
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:33,120
And this was,

945
00:29:33,121 --> 00:29:34,050
this guy was,

946
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,913
I mean he was,

947
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:36,240
he was Michael Jordan.

948
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,980
I mean before that stuff,

949
00:29:37,981 --> 00:29:38,910
before Michael joined,

950
00:29:38,911 --> 00:29:40,080
before Air Jordan,

951
00:29:40,081 --> 00:29:40,914
Bill pointed,

952
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,410
I mean this guy was
nine only toffees zone,

953
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:48,420
only a champion puts obviously
connected to be in tough by itself.

954
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,200
But it was,

955
00:29:50,201 --> 00:29:51,160
he was smart.

956
00:29:51,161 --> 00:29:51,850
He was,

957
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:52,690
he was cool.

958
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,520
He had Pazazz,

959
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:58,420
he was a man and there
were Jewish families.

960
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:00,220
You don't hear about these stories,

961
00:30:00,221 --> 00:30:05,221
but there were Jewish families I've read
and I've heard from people where say,

962
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,713
Hey,

963
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:10,030
don't let nobody pick on you.

964
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,520
Benny Leonard is the best
fighter in the world.

965
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:18,510
Choose a tough where we're
not just smart but tough.

966
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:21,910
Betty Leonard shows that.

967
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:24,160
So that kind of history,

968
00:30:24,161 --> 00:30:29,161
that kind of pulling of people
up in many different ways,

969
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,310
not just economically I out of poverty,

970
00:30:33,311 --> 00:30:33,880
but,

971
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,500
but emotionally,

972
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:36,933
mentally,

973
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:39,160
because you can be in poverty mentally,

974
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,740
you can be in the low place mentally.

975
00:30:41,741 --> 00:30:43,060
It doesn't have to be,

976
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:43,661
you know,

977
00:30:43,661 --> 00:30:45,160
financially all the time.

978
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:48,110
You know where you have holes
in your shoes and you didn't,

979
00:30:48,111 --> 00:30:50,350
and you're wearing shirts that don't fit.

980
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:50,990
No.

981
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:53,470
It can be the way you feel about yourself.

982
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:55,300
That is without,

983
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,480
without pro parity,

984
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:00,100
with with without value.

985
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,920
You'll have no value for
yourself as a person.

986
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:06,100
That's the worst poverty
in the freaking world.

987
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,840
There's not the lower than that.

988
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,660
And Joe Lewis and Benny Leonard,

989
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:11,381
they were fighters.

990
00:31:11,381 --> 00:31:12,790
They won't baseball players.

991
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:15,580
They pulled people out of those places.

992
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,220
They let people know they had value,

993
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:19,650
that their rates had value.

994
00:31:19,651 --> 00:31:20,860
Their people add value,

995
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:26,160
they had value and that should be
known and you can go anywhere and,

996
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:29,710
and I'm glad you can
because I love all sports.

997
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:33,590
You can go anywhere and you can read about
the greatness of the baseball players

998
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:34,480
in the greatness of,

999
00:31:34,481 --> 00:31:36,460
of course NFL hasn't
been around that long,

1000
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:40,600
but the greatness of those players
and the greatness of the NBA players.

1001
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:45,900
But where did the kids have a get to
read and to hear and to see about the

1002
00:31:46,841 --> 00:31:48,160
greatness of these people,

1003
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:49,270
these fighters?

1004
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,620
V Nowhere,

1005
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:52,210
very little.

1006
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:53,201
Very little.

1007
00:31:53,201 --> 00:31:54,130
It's not there.

1008
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:55,653
Why?

1009
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,700
Because again,

1010
00:31:57,701 --> 00:31:59,470
I'm not going to get into craziness,

1011
00:31:59,471 --> 00:32:00,304
but

1012
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,150
the powers that be the listener,

1013
00:32:03,151 --> 00:32:04,570
it's not marketed properly.

1014
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:05,261
I get it.

1015
00:32:05,261 --> 00:32:06,250
It doesn't have a commission,

1016
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:08,650
so it doesn't take care
of itself the way the UFC,

1017
00:32:08,651 --> 00:32:12,820
the greatness about to why the UFC grew
so much as they marketing themselves in

1018
00:32:12,821 --> 00:32:13,750
a tremendous way.

1019
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,220
So there's nobody,

1020
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,690
boxing is just dead.

1021
00:32:16,691 --> 00:32:17,740
It takes care of itself.

1022
00:32:17,741 --> 00:32:20,260
It exists because it's man against man.

1023
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,850
So it's always going to be there,

1024
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:24,220
but nobody's building it.

1025
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:25,480
Nobody's marketing in.

1026
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:30,100
No one's feeding the monster to make it
bigger and it's a plant that's in the

1027
00:32:30,101 --> 00:32:31,270
corner of,

1028
00:32:31,271 --> 00:32:31,650
of,

1029
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:34,450
of your office that doesn't get sun,

1030
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:35,780
doesn't get warranted,

1031
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:37,600
but it's still there.

1032
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:37,901
Right,

1033
00:32:37,901 --> 00:32:38,230
right.

1034
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:39,063
It's still,

1035
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:41,810
and what I'm saying is that

1036
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,060
[inaudible] I didn't want to yell
because now probably happy but,

1037
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,653
but,

1038
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,230
but it should be fed a little bit.

1039
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,130
It should be watered a little bit
because of what I just described.

1040
00:32:59,110 --> 00:32:59,943
Guys,

1041
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:04,650
guys like you guys who have a deep
appreciation for the history of the sport

1042
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:05,370
guy,

1043
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:09,000
guys who have a deep appreciation
of what it meant when Joe Louis,

1044
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,920
Max Schmeling guys,

1045
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:14,490
guys who understand what it meant when
sugar ray Robinson was the best fighter

1046
00:33:14,491 --> 00:33:18,330
in the world and everybody knew and he
pulled up in a fucking pink Cadillac with

1047
00:33:18,331 --> 00:33:19,200
a beautiful suit on

1048
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:19,860
and any,

1049
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,480
any made elevated.

1050
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:24,040
He elevated people in Harlem everywhere,

1051
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,141
but Harlem,

1052
00:33:25,141 --> 00:33:25,590
he had,

1053
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:26,850
he owned have a Harlem,

1054
00:33:26,851 --> 00:33:30,880
he owned restaurants and
stores and barber shops and,

1055
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,130
and everything.

1056
00:33:32,131 --> 00:33:32,640
And,

1057
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,210
and you want it to be there because
that's where sugar ray Robinson came from.

1058
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:37,260
Yup.

1059
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,093
It was great.

1060
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:39,570
Yeah.

1061
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:40,000
I mean,

1062
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,270
it's a rich part of history
that really does get ignored.

1063
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:43,770
Let me tell you what I was smelling.

1064
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:44,311
You brought up,

1065
00:33:44,311 --> 00:33:44,611
you know,

1066
00:33:44,611 --> 00:33:49,611
a lot of his stuff and that's
why it's nice to talk about which

1067
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:54,990
smelling was a hell of a fighter.

1068
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,420
Joe Lewis was the brown
bomber was coming up.

1069
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,200
He was undefeated and um,

1070
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:02,820
Schmoley had to Greg
quote before the fight.

1071
00:34:02,821 --> 00:34:03,001
You know,

1072
00:34:03,001 --> 00:34:06,720
it's kind of like the Babe Ruth thing
that did it really happen where he pointed

1073
00:34:06,721 --> 00:34:07,910
out and then he hit the,

1074
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:08,311
you know,

1075
00:34:08,311 --> 00:34:08,640
those,

1076
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,570
those are great stories.

1077
00:34:09,571 --> 00:34:09,781
But,

1078
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:10,614
but well,

1079
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,140
what's the real truth behind them?

1080
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:13,471
You know,

1081
00:34:13,471 --> 00:34:14,010
we don't know.

1082
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:14,910
We don't care.

1083
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:16,680
We don't care to certain point.

1084
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,543
You know why?

1085
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:19,500
Because they let us feel good.

1086
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:24,150
They let us dream about possibilities
and we should all have possibilities to

1087
00:34:24,151 --> 00:34:24,984
dream about.

1088
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:29,670
And they make somebody
feel good because you know,

1089
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,010
the Babe Ruth one was
connected to a sick kid.

1090
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:34,350
So it's a nice thing.

1091
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:39,920
It's where sports can be better
than just sports than just somebody

1092
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:43,320
participating in it.

1093
00:34:43,321 --> 00:34:44,610
It can go beyond that.

1094
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:46,620
He agreed stronger than that.

1095
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:48,420
And that's some of the
good stuff about it.

1096
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:52,650
And so smelling the great story,

1097
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:54,900
he didn't point to,

1098
00:34:54,901 --> 00:34:55,241
you know,

1099
00:34:55,241 --> 00:34:55,890
the,

1100
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:56,521
to the fence,

1101
00:34:56,521 --> 00:34:59,370
but he said before the fight,

1102
00:34:59,371 --> 00:35:02,520
I see something that's my,

1103
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:03,750
my ag,

1104
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,610
my trying to be an accent for the German,

1105
00:35:05,611 --> 00:35:06,300
you know,

1106
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,420
but I sound more like
Sholtz from Hogan's heroes.

1107
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,701
I don't know why.

1108
00:35:11,701 --> 00:35:15,090
Every time you try to do something
like with certain ethnic,

1109
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:15,901
you know,

1110
00:35:15,901 --> 00:35:16,770
pronunciations,

1111
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:17,933
um,

1112
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:18,381
you,

1113
00:35:18,381 --> 00:35:21,090
you sound like you go
to one of those sitcoms,

1114
00:35:21,091 --> 00:35:22,350
you go to one of those places,

1115
00:35:22,351 --> 00:35:22,920
you know,

1116
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,210
and when I say somebody,

1117
00:35:24,211 --> 00:35:24,901
I think my kid,

1118
00:35:24,901 --> 00:35:25,734
I think my son said,

1119
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:26,863
Eh,

1120
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:27,420
you know,

1121
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:32,420
he had watched one of them and I think
he said he sounded like Sergeant Schultz,

1122
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,160
like from Hogan's heroes,

1123
00:35:35,161 --> 00:35:35,994
but,

1124
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:36,841
and he said,

1125
00:35:36,841 --> 00:35:37,674
I see something.

1126
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:43,230
And what he saw was that Louis
would jab and he would leave.

1127
00:35:43,231 --> 00:35:44,640
You should never leave your head on a,

1128
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,610
on the right side because
if you leave your head,

1129
00:35:47,611 --> 00:35:47,851
you know,

1130
00:35:47,851 --> 00:35:49,320
you move your head to the right side,

1131
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,150
you're in a path to the right hand.

1132
00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:54,420
You should actually finish on the left
side because then you're outside the

1133
00:35:54,421 --> 00:35:55,254
right hand,

1134
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:56,143
your follower,

1135
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,830
that was the right hand over here.

1136
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,860
It can hit you on the outside.

1137
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:03,510
So he had a habit of,

1138
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:04,740
and he had a great trainer.

1139
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:08,970
He had a habit though at that point
of leaving his head off and a right.

1140
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:14,190
So smelling saw something as he said
that he could hit and we're right in.

1141
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,560
He could time it over the gym.

1142
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:22,040
Now smelling was of the ilk of the level
of the caliber wasn't just about Talon.

1143
00:36:23,771 --> 00:36:24,604
He could punch.

1144
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,553
It was a good fighter,

1145
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,240
but it was a pro.

1146
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,440
What do I mean by that?

1147
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:32,400
A lot of guys would hesitate a little bit,

1148
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,300
same opening.

1149
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,093
They might see it,

1150
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:38,040
but it was the brown bomber
who was not going everyone out.

1151
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,330
So they hesitate.

1152
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:39,960
They will.

1153
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,793
They were afraid.

1154
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,713
Normal.

1155
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:44,310
But people afraid of that word.

1156
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,500
I mean it's there.

1157
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:47,791
I mean without it,

1158
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:48,624
we're not alive.

1159
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:51,750
So he,

1160
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:53,820
they might see the same thing,

1161
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:55,680
but they weren't going at a pro level.

1162
00:36:55,681 --> 00:36:58,290
Pro Level is a guy that
can do what he has to do.

1163
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,360
And no emotions interfere with doing it.

1164
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,470
I mean that's my simplest way
of Webster's might not say that,

1165
00:37:04,471 --> 00:37:05,310
but that's what I would say.

1166
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:08,250
So they might've seen the opening,

1167
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:13,170
but they would hesitate just
enough and be gone the door close.

1168
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:14,150
Cause it's,

1169
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:14,830
it's,

1170
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:15,960
it's like life.

1171
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:17,880
It's moments captured moment,

1172
00:37:17,881 --> 00:37:18,714
lose a moment.

1173
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:19,500
And,

1174
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,760
but this guy was a pro.

1175
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:21,990
He,

1176
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:25,900
he didn't let that come in there
and make them hesitate that,

1177
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:26,773
that fear,

1178
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:27,683
he controlled it.

1179
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,340
And if a Doberman was there,

1180
00:37:29,341 --> 00:37:29,850
Bang,

1181
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:30,930
he was going to throw the punch.

1182
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:33,720
So he did and he dropped lose a few times.

1183
00:37:33,721 --> 00:37:34,890
And you know,

1184
00:37:34,891 --> 00:37:35,181
he,

1185
00:37:35,181 --> 00:37:38,980
he won that fight and was around and stop,

1186
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:39,300
man,

1187
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,230
I can't even remember.

1188
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:40,800
Maybe,

1189
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,910
maybe the ninth,

1190
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:43,170
but it was late in a fight,

1191
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,440
but he had heard them and you know,

1192
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,720
Louis was taken a beating.

1193
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,610
So Louis Lou went on,

1194
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:57,630
he won a world title and um,

1195
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:01,260
he'd be Bradick for the title,

1196
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,220
Cinderella Man,

1197
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,030
great movie.

1198
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:03,863
It was made,

1199
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:04,711
you know,

1200
00:38:04,711 --> 00:38:07,290
he came from welfare to
be in a world champion.

1201
00:38:07,291 --> 00:38:09,450
That's the product story without
getting into it too much.

1202
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:12,660
So he lose beach Braddock.

1203
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:15,960
And had to give a percentage,

1204
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,110
you know,

1205
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:17,730
Eh,

1206
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,770
Don King and Ara might
not been around then,

1207
00:38:19,771 --> 00:38:20,220
but,

1208
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:24,300
but the people that taught him what
to do around taught them how to take

1209
00:38:24,301 --> 00:38:25,230
advantage of fighters,

1210
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:26,161
told them of how,

1211
00:38:26,161 --> 00:38:29,010
of what options were for four
options where ever known,

1212
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:30,470
you know,

1213
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:31,190
Eh,

1214
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:31,540
Eh,

1215
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:34,590
the Vladik I think,

1216
00:38:34,591 --> 00:38:35,590
I forget his name,

1217
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:40,730
but products manager basically made
Lewis and his people agree to give them a

1218
00:38:41,831 --> 00:38:44,740
percentage of his purse for the
rest of his career to get the fight.

1219
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:45,800
Yeah.

1220
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,633
So,

1221
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:47,230
yeah,

1222
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,041
so I mean,

1223
00:38:48,041 --> 00:38:51,020
you could obviously research
it and look into it presents.

1224
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:51,921
So I don't know.

1225
00:38:51,921 --> 00:38:52,600
I listen,

1226
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,740
I could say 10%,

1227
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:58,090
but I don't want to say definitively
because I'm not positive,

1228
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,320
but,

1229
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,030
but there was an understanding that,

1230
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:01,691
you know,

1231
00:39:01,691 --> 00:39:01,811
you,

1232
00:39:01,811 --> 00:39:03,250
you're not getting a fight otherwise.

1233
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:06,060
Like you want to get the
fight now and listen to,

1234
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:07,563
like I said,

1235
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:08,680
you know,

1236
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,640
not great guys,

1237
00:39:09,641 --> 00:39:12,270
but king and Iram,

1238
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:13,143
uh,

1239
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:14,080
they,

1240
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:17,410
they had other guys before them that
taught them some of these moves,

1241
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:18,460
you know,

1242
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,630
that warm and so nice.

1243
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:23,050
But there's always a
history of good and bad.

1244
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,280
Sure always.

1245
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:25,143
Who's good?

1246
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:25,780
Well,

1247
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,730
this is,

1248
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:27,723
we get to that.

1249
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,270
If there's a shining
star promoter out there,

1250
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,340
I try to think about it.

1251
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,710
But so we,

1252
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,350
so they go and they are,

1253
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:42,280
he witnessed the title and of course
the biggest sport in the country.

1254
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,650
So all the presses there and there,

1255
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:47,950
Joe Champion was not yet.

1256
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,233
Not yet.

1257
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,033
What do you mean not yet?

1258
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:52,363
Just one of the title.

1259
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:53,733
Not yet.

1260
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:54,101
Not Too.

1261
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:54,934
I beat that man.

1262
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:56,920
He didn't even have to say his name.

1263
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:57,880
Not Too,

1264
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,660
I beat that man.

1265
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,920
That's how much pride he had.

1266
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,630
And listen,

1267
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:04,960
he's the real deal because in his mind,

1268
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:07,540
how can I be champion
if a guy knocked me out?

1269
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:08,410
Right.

1270
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:10,750
So when that fight took place,

1271
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:15,370
I mean you talk about setting a stage,

1272
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:16,340
you know,

1273
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,620
the nowadays people say,

1274
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:19,180
oh I'm on the stage is a lot of pressure,

1275
00:40:19,181 --> 00:40:19,930
you know,

1276
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:20,201
hey,

1277
00:40:20,201 --> 00:40:21,250
I'm not saying it's not,

1278
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:22,570
I'm not saying it,

1279
00:40:22,571 --> 00:40:24,070
but a lot of pressure,

1280
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,840
you'd almost done a lot of people look in,

1281
00:40:25,841 --> 00:40:26,674
a lot of people,

1282
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:27,280
you know,

1283
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,800
dependent on I I lot of stuff going on,

1284
00:40:29,801 --> 00:40:30,191
you know,

1285
00:40:30,191 --> 00:40:30,700
and,

1286
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,900
and I,

1287
00:40:31,901 --> 00:40:32,620
you know,

1288
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,330
maybe I got a headache,

1289
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:39,810
but Cho Lewis had world
war two on horizon,

1290
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:46,680
the president of the United States
call them up and you had Nazi Germany,

1291
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:51,820
he had a guy named Hitler that
that is saying that he's got,

1292
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:52,300
you know,

1293
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,880
the master race it's going
to take over the world.

1294
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,880
Just starting that stuff was not too far
away from World War Two and you've got

1295
00:41:00,221 --> 00:41:05,221
all that stuff permeating in the air
and you got Louis fighting a guy who of

1296
00:41:06,971 --> 00:41:07,804
course,

1297
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:08,763
you know,

1298
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,800
propaganda was started by the Germans,

1299
00:41:11,801 --> 00:41:12,341
if you want.

1300
00:41:12,341 --> 00:41:16,870
Almost to me almost invented that word
because you had to propaganda minister

1301
00:41:16,871 --> 00:41:20,940
and you had all these terrible people
with Hitler that we're putting out to dare

1302
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:24,360
the master race to this day that you
had to judge you all win situation

1303
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:25,020
Olympics.

1304
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:25,420
Yeah.

1305
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:30,420
And now you had the biggest sport in
the biggest country and the champion of

1306
00:41:31,841 --> 00:41:36,841
that sport to heavyweight Joe Lewis
and he's fighting the German fighter

1307
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:42,080
swelling the second time now for
the title and of course you had

1308
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:49,300
Hitler and all his psycho fence
or these people that were,

1309
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:55,090
their job was to promote it so to
speak and they'd come and as saying,

1310
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,000
we will show the world that we're superior
and there's no better way to show it

1311
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:03,613
then in a ring.

1312
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:06,650
And so Lewis has to,

1313
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:08,523
okay,

1314
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:09,453
he's got it,

1315
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,350
he's got to carry all this stuff.

1316
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:16,160
I mean take about it and he's
a black guy in a catchy that,

1317
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:18,880
that he still can't go to certain places,

1318
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:22,690
teat and he's got to carry the whole,

1319
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:29,680
he's got to carry the whole country
and not let them down in the president

1320
00:42:29,681 --> 00:42:30,560
because I didn't get,

1321
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,320
we don't know if there's
a legendary story,

1322
00:42:32,321 --> 00:42:33,640
we don't know if it's completely true,

1323
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:35,860
but supposedly the president
called him and said,

1324
00:42:35,861 --> 00:42:36,041
Joe,

1325
00:42:36,041 --> 00:42:38,820
you got to witness one for
the good guys that that's,

1326
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:39,970
that's one of the legends.

1327
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:41,470
I don't know if it's true,

1328
00:42:41,471 --> 00:42:42,251
but I know that,

1329
00:42:42,251 --> 00:42:43,300
I'm sure he corner,

1330
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:48,370
I'm sure we called them
and Louis has to go into,

1331
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:55,070
is kind of going to Yankee Stadium
outdoors and in Times Square in New York,

1332
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:02,710
they used to have it set up where they
would the radio because all the fight one

1333
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,870
radio back then and some
of them on fights on TV on.

1334
00:43:05,871 --> 00:43:07,970
She'll lead cavalcade of
sports and all that stuff.

1335
00:43:07,971 --> 00:43:10,850
Friday night fights but was coming along,

1336
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:11,460
you know,

1337
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:12,440
to come along.

1338
00:43:12,441 --> 00:43:14,360
But radio was the thing.

1339
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:19,970
And so in Times Square you had
the radio speakers outdoors,

1340
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:22,570
you know,

1341
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:23,620
playing a fight,

1342
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,120
podcasts in the fight.

1343
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:26,620
So people are out on the streets,

1344
00:43:26,621 --> 00:43:29,230
they hear the radio and they hear,

1345
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:29,740
you know,

1346
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:33,340
Joe Loses walking into
the ring and you know,

1347
00:43:33,341 --> 00:43:34,990
and you got Yankee Stadium,

1348
00:43:34,991 --> 00:43:39,991
you've got to place four and you've got
the whole world of everything I just

1349
00:43:40,301 --> 00:43:41,134
described.

1350
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:42,941
The good,

1351
00:43:42,941 --> 00:43:43,511
the bad,

1352
00:43:43,511 --> 00:43:44,021
the evil,

1353
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:44,560
the ugly,

1354
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,030
every thing.

1355
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,110
It's not a movie,

1356
00:43:47,111 --> 00:43:48,220
it's real life.

1357
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:54,300
And you got Joe Lewis and he gets in that
ring and he annihilates with all this

1358
00:43:55,301 --> 00:43:58,510
pressure would said that
he's got to save the,

1359
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:01,420
basically the United
States in a world from,

1360
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:05,110
from looking like this ugly

1361
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:08,180
scorge and,

1362
00:44:08,181 --> 00:44:08,451
and,

1363
00:44:08,451 --> 00:44:12,200
and disease of the Nazi party is,

1364
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:13,490
is going to take over.

1365
00:44:13,491 --> 00:44:18,491
The world is greater than us and he and
he single handedly has to prove that.

1366
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:21,323
And he,

1367
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:26,130
he goes in and he annihilates the Chi
in one round with all that stuff hanging

1368
00:44:26,131 --> 00:44:26,730
over them.

1369
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:31,530
I think that's the greatest single
event in the history of world.

1370
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:33,023
Pull that fighter,

1371
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:33,631
pull out,

1372
00:44:33,631 --> 00:44:35,010
fight up and put it in the background.

1373
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:36,990
And I think that diet,

1374
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:39,000
when you talk about all the things,

1375
00:44:39,001 --> 00:44:40,290
the way here to talk about,

1376
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:42,270
about character,

1377
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:43,920
about talent,

1378
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,380
about perseverance,

1379
00:44:46,381 --> 00:44:47,460
about resiliency,

1380
00:44:47,461 --> 00:44:48,120
about,

1381
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,590
about caring,

1382
00:44:49,591 --> 00:44:51,120
about more than yourself,

1383
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,400
about selflessness,

1384
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:55,800
about strength,

1385
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:01,700
when you talk about all those things
that we try to say that we care about and

1386
00:45:02,341 --> 00:45:04,410
that we sometimes look to,

1387
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:05,573
to be,

1388
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:06,211
um,

1389
00:45:06,211 --> 00:45:07,800
very rarely can we be that

1390
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:12,260
he was all that he was all of that.

1391
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:14,750
And there it is right there.

1392
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:15,260
I mean,

1393
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:16,370
how great is that?

1394
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,500
And he stalked the guy,

1395
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:23,980
he's talked to guy and his punches
were short and powerful and he was the

1396
00:45:25,461 --> 00:45:30,020
greatest finisher in the history of
heavyweight bouncing because when he hurts

1397
00:45:30,021 --> 00:45:30,854
you,

1398
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,330
you didn't survive.

1399
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:33,470
He got rid of you.

1400
00:45:33,471 --> 00:45:37,160
He put punches together and it was
short and he was always in position.

1401
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:38,420
Look at his legs.

1402
00:45:38,421 --> 00:45:39,590
He's always a position.

1403
00:45:39,591 --> 00:45:40,281
You move forward.

1404
00:45:40,281 --> 00:45:44,780
It takes a little stub fall back to get
yourself all those punches is absolutely

1405
00:45:44,781 --> 00:45:45,381
beautiful.

1406
00:45:45,381 --> 00:45:48,260
If you wanted to teach a young
fighter how to punch correctly,

1407
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:49,340
Joe Louis,

1408
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:50,690
there's no better guy to Washington.

1409
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:51,563
Cholos.

1410
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:53,270
Did you see Joe,

1411
00:45:53,271 --> 00:45:55,570
what he did a minute ago?

1412
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:56,270
No,

1413
00:45:56,270 --> 00:45:57,110
a minute ago.

1414
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,011
Smelling.

1415
00:45:58,011 --> 00:45:59,840
Tried to catch him with
that same right hand.

1416
00:45:59,841 --> 00:46:01,540
He had knocked him out two years earlier.

1417
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:02,330
Go back.

1418
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:03,320
They just missed it,

1419
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,880
but he changed.

1420
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:05,990
He stepped out.

1421
00:46:05,991 --> 00:46:10,991
He changed his distance this time because
jaggy Blackburn who's a great fighter,

1422
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:12,770
a black fighter.

1423
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:16,550
He was a trainee who was a great train
and nobody hears about Jackie Blackburn

1424
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:20,900
what a great fighter he was and what
a great trainee was and how he wasn't

1425
00:46:20,901 --> 00:46:24,020
allowed to fight white
fighters and he beat everybody.

1426
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:24,860
Look at it.

1427
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:25,790
Cattle love talk.

1428
00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:29,030
Instead of laying his head on the
right like he did the first fight,

1429
00:46:29,031 --> 00:46:31,910
he changed his range and he
made that right hand mess.

1430
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:34,070
I look how calm he is.

1431
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:35,420
Look how calm he is.

1432
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:37,220
Look how focused he is.

1433
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:39,740
It's beautiful.

1434
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:41,720
Watch shortness of those punches.

1435
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:43,760
Phenomenal watches legs,

1436
00:46:43,761 --> 00:46:44,870
Jo wide swaths.

1437
00:46:44,871 --> 00:46:46,310
How he's always in position.

1438
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:47,173
Look at Atlanta.

1439
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:49,250
What did we miss?

1440
00:46:49,251 --> 00:46:50,090
What didn't you see?

1441
00:46:50,091 --> 00:46:50,720
Go back.

1442
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:51,440
The sides don't.

1443
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,070
No,

1444
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:54,290
the blinding jab that that sets it up.

1445
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,850
We don't see what the gem is.

1446
00:46:55,851 --> 00:46:56,690
Just a dick boy,

1447
00:46:57,110 --> 00:46:59,440
just so we can hit it with
the right so you don't see it.

1448
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:00,313
Right.

1449
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:03,080
What a beautiful sidestep to right
after he lands the right hand.

1450
00:47:03,081 --> 00:47:03,710
Beautiful.

1451
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:04,500
Look at that.

1452
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,590
Well that's why he's the
greatest finish of all time.

1453
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:07,671
Watch,

1454
00:47:07,671 --> 00:47:09,290
watch way finishes this guy.

1455
00:47:09,291 --> 00:47:11,560
What it's going to go to
the body and in the head,

1456
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:13,190
right head to the body.

1457
00:47:13,191 --> 00:47:14,240
Right ahead to the head.

1458
00:47:14,570 --> 00:47:15,403
Ha.

1459
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:17,180
That is so short.

1460
00:47:17,181 --> 00:47:18,530
And even when he's got the guy hurt,

1461
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,370
look at the guy.

1462
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:19,881
Look at that.

1463
00:47:19,881 --> 00:47:20,714
Phenomenal,

1464
00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:22,400
phenomenal.

1465
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:26,270
And he did all of that with everything
we just talked about for the last 20

1466
00:47:26,271 --> 00:47:26,990
minutes.

1467
00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:28,010
Hanging over him.

1468
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:28,873
Yeah.

1469
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:31,160
Oh,

1470
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,630
it's a giant piece of history
that people don't talk about it.

1471
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:35,190
Doesn't that make you think a little bit,

1472
00:47:35,191 --> 00:47:37,710
doesn't it make you
feel something about us?

1473
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:38,370
Really?

1474
00:47:38,370 --> 00:47:38,641
Yeah.

1475
00:47:38,641 --> 00:47:41,010
Well it's one of the reasons why
I'm a giants fan of the sport.

1476
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:41,580
Yeah.

1477
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:42,060
Thank you.

1478
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:42,331
I mean,

1479
00:47:42,331 --> 00:47:42,840
and that,

1480
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:46,380
that alone is in terms of
like historical impact.

1481
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,041
I agree with you.

1482
00:47:47,041 --> 00:47:51,060
It's one of the biggest moments
in all of sports ever in life.

1483
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:51,923
In life.

1484
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:53,310
You know what I like about boxing?

1485
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:56,660
I like a lot of things at all.

1486
00:47:56,661 --> 00:47:59,440
Like I don't like the administrators.

1487
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,293
I hate them.

1488
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:01,700
I know there's a powerful word,

1489
00:48:01,701 --> 00:48:02,900
but you know,

1490
00:48:02,901 --> 00:48:04,070
not every single one of them,

1491
00:48:04,071 --> 00:48:05,170
but I'm just saying I,

1492
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:06,063
I,

1493
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:07,490
I hate their weakness.

1494
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:09,170
I hate that cowardice.

1495
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,113
I do.

1496
00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:12,020
I do.

1497
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:13,430
Because they sit outside the ring.

1498
00:48:13,431 --> 00:48:14,030
A lot of them,

1499
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:15,200
you brought up a point,

1500
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,980
they should have had an experience one
way or the other and they've never ever

1501
00:48:18,981 --> 00:48:19,460
had any,

1502
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:20,091
he punched him.

1503
00:48:20,091 --> 00:48:21,950
And I'm not saying you to be a man,

1504
00:48:21,951 --> 00:48:22,761
you got to get punched.

1505
00:48:22,761 --> 00:48:24,260
I'm not saying any of that stuff.

1506
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:26,510
It's being a man as a lot more than that.

1507
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:27,920
A lot more know.

1508
00:48:27,921 --> 00:48:29,960
Plenty of people get
punched and then I met.

1509
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:35,650
But what I'm saying is that you should
understand what it feels to a person to

1510
00:48:38,301 --> 00:48:43,220
put themselves on the line and to
risk so much and to risk everything

1511
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:47,750
to try to get their
family in a better place.

1512
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,280
I think there's also,

1513
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:50,540
they should be a fan.

1514
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:53,030
And I don't think some
of them are even fans.

1515
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:53,181
No,

1516
00:48:53,181 --> 00:48:53,900
they're not.

1517
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:54,621
And some of my,

1518
00:48:54,621 --> 00:48:55,490
not even like it,

1519
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:56,510
they wouldn't tell you that.

1520
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:57,140
Right.

1521
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:58,310
But they just do it for a job.

1522
00:48:58,460 --> 00:48:59,030
Yeah.

1523
00:48:59,030 --> 00:48:59,330
And,

1524
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:00,860
and what I'm saying is that

1525
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:03,770
when you,

1526
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:07,490
when I see these people that haven't
put them spending that place and not

1527
00:49:07,491 --> 00:49:08,630
everyone can be in that place.

1528
00:49:08,631 --> 00:49:09,171
So again,

1529
00:49:09,171 --> 00:49:11,510
I gotta be careful with that
if I'm going to be fair,

1530
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:17,720
but for them so easily to take
something away from somebody,

1531
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:19,760
see what's different for me,

1532
00:49:19,761 --> 00:49:21,410
why I get passionate.

1533
00:49:21,411 --> 00:49:22,430
And if you want to use that word,

1534
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:23,181
people say Teddy,

1535
00:49:23,181 --> 00:49:24,410
you can get a little crazy

1536
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:31,710
if it happens in baseball and the guy
beats out to 12 now you have cameras.

1537
00:49:31,851 --> 00:49:33,110
So you didn't use half that.

1538
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:37,100
But if a guy you didn't
have replay back in the day,

1539
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:38,240
the guy,

1540
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,260
it happened a lot of times,

1541
00:49:39,261 --> 00:49:40,100
guy was safe and,

1542
00:49:40,101 --> 00:49:40,934
and call them out.

1543
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:42,080
You know what?

1544
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:42,610
Too Bad.

1545
00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:42,900
It's a,

1546
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:43,733
it's a shame,

1547
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:44,781
but you know what?

1548
00:49:44,781 --> 00:49:48,890
The next day he's going to play the game
again and he's going to be able to make

1549
00:49:48,891 --> 00:49:49,724
amends for that.

1550
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:52,670
He and his family and he's
got guaranteed contracts.

1551
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:55,130
And you know what it's going to be okay.

1552
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:55,730
I mean,

1553
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:56,563
was it right?

1554
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:57,980
Wrong is never right.

1555
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,113
No,

1556
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:00,770
but you know what?

1557
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:04,700
In the mix of things
we could overcome that.

1558
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:06,410
But now you take a fighter,

1559
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:11,960
same thing and the judge judges
make a mistake maybe on purpose,

1560
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:12,770
whatever,

1561
00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:14,810
but they make a bad mistake.

1562
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:16,011
The fight,

1563
00:50:16,011 --> 00:50:19,130
it can't go back the next day and
rectify that to fight it doesn't have a

1564
00:50:19,131 --> 00:50:20,150
guaranteed contract.

1565
00:50:20,151 --> 00:50:22,820
He only has what he can make
if he gets to that fight,

1566
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,720
that's it for that night
because where that fight goes,

1567
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:27,980
he go back to the

1568
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:32,980
dug out and then come out the next day
and play again with a new uniform on.

1569
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:38,680
Now he goes to the back of the line
and boxing and has to take hundreds,

1570
00:50:38,901 --> 00:50:42,470
maybe thousands of punches
to get back to that place.

1571
00:50:42,471 --> 00:50:47,471
He was to earn the right to get closer
to the exit in a business because

1572
00:50:48,321 --> 00:50:51,860
everyone's trying to get to the exit
to try and again what they can gain,

1573
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:55,580
but their legacy for their families,

1574
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:59,510
for themselves in many ways financially,

1575
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:00,051
you know,

1576
00:51:00,051 --> 00:51:01,070
and and,

1577
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:05,810
but also what's inside them that they,

1578
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:07,640
that they have to prove something,

1579
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:11,210
that they have to make it for
old different personal reasons.

1580
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:16,870
And they're close to doing that and now
they're forced because of some crock.

1581
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:19,520
Maybe it's incompetence.

1582
00:51:19,521 --> 00:51:21,230
It either corruption and incompetence.

1583
00:51:21,231 --> 00:51:22,064
Okay.

1584
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:26,660
But sometimes it's corruption and they
have to go all the way to the back of the

1585
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:27,623
liner.

1586
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,320
Then I'm playing a football
game the next Sunday.

1587
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:36,040
Then I played in an NBA game two days
later and they got to take all those

1588
00:51:36,591 --> 00:51:37,940
punches and hope,

1589
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:39,493
hope

1590
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:42,320
they get back to that place.

1591
00:51:42,830 --> 00:51:43,520
And you know what?

1592
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,360
I seen it.

1593
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:48,080
I did 22 years of ESPN boxing.

1594
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:49,850
I've been with ESPN about 22 years,

1595
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:51,410
but I did like 18 years,

1596
00:51:51,411 --> 00:51:53,060
whatever was a Friday night fights.

1597
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:55,430
We did a lot of title fights.

1598
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:56,900
Not to big names,

1599
00:51:56,901 --> 00:51:58,070
not to Canelo's,

1600
00:51:58,071 --> 00:52:00,050
not not to go off gins,

1601
00:52:00,051 --> 00:52:01,220
not the Mayweathers,

1602
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:05,480
what guys that had mentors as much
to even more because they didn't have

1603
00:52:05,481 --> 00:52:10,481
millions of Dallas and they got this
shot and I watched them get robbed

1604
00:52:12,290 --> 00:52:14,240
and I saw that they never got back there.

1605
00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:16,790
That night was the right night for them.

1606
00:52:16,791 --> 00:52:18,260
That particular night,

1607
00:52:18,261 --> 00:52:19,370
everything worked.

1608
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:21,170
Everything was perfect,

1609
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:22,790
all that training,

1610
00:52:22,791 --> 00:52:26,690
everything came together
and they were beautiful.

1611
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:31,640
They were magnificent and they were
freaking robbed and it's wrong.

1612
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:33,110
It's really wrong.

1613
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:35,960
And that's what they do when they do that.

1614
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,480
But the glorious thing
of if that's not too

1615
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:42,290
made up of a word,

1616
00:52:42,291 --> 00:52:43,310
it sounds like Gloria,

1617
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:48,670
but the beautiful thing about boxing is
that with everything warm in the world,

1618
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:55,040
and I hate to use this cliche,

1619
00:52:55,041 --> 00:52:55,880
this terminology,

1620
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:58,550
but you know with life being unfair,

1621
00:52:58,551 --> 00:53:00,500
because I don't like to use that because,

1622
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:03,440
because sometimes people nowadays for me,

1623
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:04,370
they,

1624
00:53:04,370 --> 00:53:05,840
there's too many excuses out there.

1625
00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:06,650
There really are.

1626
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:08,240
There's too many damn excuses.

1627
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:09,321
You're in this country,

1628
00:53:09,321 --> 00:53:13,010
you got a chance to do something
where you don't have in other places.

1629
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:16,220
But having said that,

1630
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:18,710
he can feel like life's
not fair sometimes,

1631
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:23,000
especially when you think about some of
the things we just talked about in a day

1632
00:53:23,001 --> 00:53:23,811
that's gone now.

1633
00:53:23,811 --> 00:53:24,740
It's not there no more,

1634
00:53:24,741 --> 00:53:25,380
but,

1635
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:25,621
well,

1636
00:53:25,621 --> 00:53:26,400
Dave Lewis

1637
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,540
and all those kind of people,

1638
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:28,740
life wasn't fair.

1639
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:30,181
That really,

1640
00:53:30,181 --> 00:53:31,920
they really had a right to use that say,

1641
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:33,031
nowadays,

1642
00:53:33,031 --> 00:53:34,980
I don't think people have of white,

1643
00:53:34,981 --> 00:53:35,401
black,

1644
00:53:35,401 --> 00:53:36,234
purple,

1645
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,930
they don't have a right to say that
to the extent that they did back then.

1646
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:40,730
Not to the extent,

1647
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:40,960
no,

1648
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:41,160
no,

1649
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:41,760
they don't.

1650
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,130
They really lose all the things
wrong or they're messed up.

1651
00:53:44,131 --> 00:53:45,090
People still out there.

1652
00:53:45,091 --> 00:53:45,600
Yeah,

1653
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:45,991
yeah,

1654
00:53:45,991 --> 00:53:46,411
yeah,

1655
00:53:46,411 --> 00:53:46,771
yeah,

1656
00:53:46,771 --> 00:53:47,604
yeah.

1657
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:50,880
But sometimes it's too easy to use that.

1658
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:51,230
Yeah.

1659
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:52,230
It's just too easy.

1660
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:52,980
I agree.

1661
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:53,813
So,

1662
00:53:54,090 --> 00:53:57,420
but there was a time when
life too often was unfair.

1663
00:53:57,570 --> 00:53:58,520
Ruthlessly on unfair.

1664
00:53:58,740 --> 00:53:59,580
Really unfair.

1665
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:00,480
Ruthlessly.

1666
00:54:00,481 --> 00:54:01,080
Yeah,

1667
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:01,913
yeah,

1668
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:02,803
yeah.

1669
00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:05,490
Okay.

1670
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:08,460
And when life was unfair,

1671
00:54:08,461 --> 00:54:10,740
boxing was around to make it fair,

1672
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:11,693
and I'll tell you how.

1673
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:13,883
Yeah.

1674
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:15,170
On one given night.

1675
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:18,230
If you worked hard enough,

1676
00:54:19,070 --> 00:54:21,470
if you dream big enough,

1677
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:25,810
if you were tough enough and
you made yourself tough enough,

1678
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:27,640
you sacrificed enough,

1679
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:34,610
you became polished and savvy
enough and and technically

1680
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:42,240
equipped to do things that you had and
you learn those things and you just work

1681
00:54:42,331 --> 00:54:43,510
yourself to the ball,

1682
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:45,320
okay?

1683
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:46,520
No matter where you came from,

1684
00:54:46,521 --> 00:54:48,410
no matter what part of the world,

1685
00:54:48,411 --> 00:54:48,811
no matter what,

1686
00:54:48,811 --> 00:54:49,730
who your parents were,

1687
00:54:49,731 --> 00:54:52,180
no matter what your poverty
level may have been made,

1688
00:54:52,181 --> 00:54:53,014
not of bed,

1689
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:54,920
no matter what you had,

1690
00:54:55,130 --> 00:54:55,371
would,

1691
00:54:55,371 --> 00:54:56,210
you didn't have,

1692
00:54:56,930 --> 00:54:58,990
no matter what people had told you,

1693
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:00,890
didn't tell you

1694
00:55:02,810 --> 00:55:03,643
all of that.

1695
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:09,080
If you made yourself and took advantage
of that opportunity and get yourself

1696
00:55:09,081 --> 00:55:09,914
ready

1697
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:15,160
and you were ready to
behave like a champion,

1698
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:22,020
you could get in that ring on one given
night and make the world fair and have

1699
00:55:23,621 --> 00:55:24,460
your hand lifted,

1700
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:26,920
heavy call champion of the world.

1701
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:29,740
That makes boxes special.

1702
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,950
And that's what these judges don't get.

1703
00:55:34,370 --> 00:55:34,990
Okay?

1704
00:55:34,990 --> 00:55:39,790
That kids are waiting to hear
that and they give everything,

1705
00:55:41,290 --> 00:55:41,541
you know,

1706
00:55:41,541 --> 00:55:42,850
you hear too much to crap.

1707
00:55:42,851 --> 00:55:46,420
Where I would dive for those
people that would die for that.

1708
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:49,090
So we have people in our times,

1709
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:49,931
in his world,

1710
00:55:49,931 --> 00:55:50,770
in his country,

1711
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,290
and you use the right world word,

1712
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:54,280
you know,

1713
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:54,911
tragically,

1714
00:55:54,911 --> 00:55:57,880
whatever powerful words you
had just shows ruthlessly.

1715
00:55:58,660 --> 00:55:59,320
Yeah,

1716
00:55:59,320 --> 00:55:59,620
yeah.

1717
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:01,780
There will people because of that word,

1718
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:06,520
because of the reality of the
actions attached to that world word.

1719
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:08,803
Okay.

1720
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:10,031
If you told them,

1721
00:56:10,031 --> 00:56:11,140
listen you,

1722
00:56:11,770 --> 00:56:12,970
you got us to you,

1723
00:56:12,971 --> 00:56:14,110
you're going to have to die,

1724
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:15,160
you know after this,

1725
00:56:15,161 --> 00:56:16,600
but you'll get to have this,

1726
00:56:16,601 --> 00:56:17,830
your hand will be lifted.

1727
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:19,930
You will be called champion of the world.

1728
00:56:19,931 --> 00:56:24,931
All your people will see it and the
people you want see it and yourself,

1729
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:29,710
but your die afterwards
I would give you that.

1730
00:56:29,711 --> 00:56:30,670
People would sign on.

1731
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:33,130
That's how important that was.

1732
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:38,550
That's what that stood for and then you
get judges that have no conception of

1733
00:56:39,371 --> 00:56:40,204
that.

1734
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:42,640
I don't mean to laugh,

1735
00:56:42,641 --> 00:56:43,460
but no,

1736
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:46,150
I learned saying they have to
have a complete conception of it,

1737
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:49,630
but no feeling of what
we're talking about.

1738
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:51,700
I think they're like DMV workers.

1739
00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:52,581
That's what I think.

1740
00:56:52,581 --> 00:56:54,290
I think there's a bunch of
them that are real good,

1741
00:56:54,291 --> 00:56:57,050
but a lot of them are just like people
that had just taken a government job.

1742
00:56:58,250 --> 00:56:58,910
That's what I think.

1743
00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:01,190
And I think it's a travesty
that they're not removed.

1744
00:57:01,310 --> 00:57:04,660
That's what I think when
whenever I go to a UFC and it,

1745
00:57:04,661 --> 00:57:05,330
like I said,

1746
00:57:05,330 --> 00:57:05,811
a lot of it,

1747
00:57:05,811 --> 00:57:06,644
the same judges,

1748
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:08,360
and I see some of these,

1749
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,313
these scores,

1750
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:14,000
I want to take my fucking headset off
and throw it into the cage and scream and

1751
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:18,260
flip over the table and you just kind
of take a deep breath and calm yourself

1752
00:57:18,261 --> 00:57:20,210
down because there's nothing you can do.

1753
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,100
And these athletic commissions have kept,

1754
00:57:22,101 --> 00:57:23,990
kept these people on for whatever reason.

1755
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:25,580
And you're watching a bad decision.

1756
00:57:25,581 --> 00:57:27,740
You watch the someone
who trained for eight,

1757
00:57:27,741 --> 00:57:30,860
10 weeks for this one particular fight
and years and years to get to that

1758
00:57:30,861 --> 00:57:34,040
position and they're getting fucked and
the getting fucked because someone just

1759
00:57:34,041 --> 00:57:36,020
sucks at their job and they don't care.

1760
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:36,853
And this person,

1761
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:37,411
they,

1762
00:57:37,411 --> 00:57:37,640
they,

1763
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:40,280
they're going to be there two
months from now at another fight.

1764
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,200
And there's nothing you could do about it.

1765
00:57:42,201 --> 00:57:43,220
And I don't understand it.

1766
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:45,260
I don't understand how the
commissions let this slide.

1767
00:57:45,470 --> 00:57:48,140
I don't know how difficult it is to
fire these people would approve they're

1768
00:57:48,141 --> 00:57:48,974
incompetent.

1769
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:52,310
But I do know that especially with with,

1770
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:53,160
oh,

1771
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:55,670
I guess it's probably true
with both boxing and MMA,

1772
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,650
there are countless fans out there.

1773
00:57:57,651 --> 00:57:59,120
They would do a far better job,

1774
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:00,313
countless,

1775
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:05,240
countless people that have experienced
in fighting countless people that have a

1776
00:58:05,241 --> 00:58:08,480
deep appreciation and understanding
of what's actually going on inside the

1777
00:58:08,481 --> 00:58:09,314
fight.

1778
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,240
And these people don't get those jobs.

1779
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:16,540
And instead the same fools continue
to give piss poor decisions or corrupt

1780
00:58:17,271 --> 00:58:18,104
decisions.

1781
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:18,501
I mean,

1782
00:58:18,501 --> 00:58:19,520
whoever that woman was,

1783
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:19,970
you know,

1784
00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:22,070
there's even mention people's names,

1785
00:58:22,071 --> 00:58:23,480
but there's been some decisions.

1786
00:58:23,510 --> 00:58:25,040
There's been some horrific

1787
00:58:26,250 --> 00:58:27,260
with the Mayweather.

1788
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:28,090
Uh,

1789
00:58:28,090 --> 00:58:30,270
you told him about the
Mayweather Canelo Ah,

1790
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:31,550
yes.

1791
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:33,800
The woman had had in a drawer.

1792
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:34,693
Yes.

1793
00:58:35,090 --> 00:58:35,510
What?

1794
00:58:35,510 --> 00:58:35,961
I'm not going to,

1795
00:58:35,961 --> 00:58:36,561
I know a name,

1796
00:58:36,561 --> 00:58:37,394
but I'm not going to it

1797
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:39,860
her name either because
she was also involved in,

1798
00:58:39,890 --> 00:58:40,251
uh,

1799
00:58:40,251 --> 00:58:41,330
another one was it?

1800
00:58:41,590 --> 00:58:41,801
Yeah,

1801
00:58:41,801 --> 00:58:42,700
she got Tony Brown,

1802
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:43,510
I think.

1803
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:44,410
Manny Pacquiao.

1804
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:45,520
Yeah.

1805
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,720
She was involved in a couple.

1806
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:47,613
Yeah,

1807
00:58:47,770 --> 00:58:48,680
a couple.

1808
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:49,953
At least to,

1809
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:51,460
I think we're being,

1810
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:53,260
we're being responsible.

1811
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:54,731
Um,

1812
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:55,690
why was she still there?

1813
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:56,703
Right.

1814
00:58:56,710 --> 00:58:57,310
Seriously.

1815
00:58:57,310 --> 00:58:57,880
Why was she,

1816
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,050
why was she still that?

1817
00:58:59,080 --> 00:58:59,530
Why?

1818
00:58:59,530 --> 00:59:00,040
Yeah,

1819
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:00,311
why?

1820
00:59:00,311 --> 00:59:01,450
Why was she still there?

1821
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:02,313
I mean,

1822
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:06,150
we're not talking about
neurosurgeon said really,

1823
00:59:06,990 --> 00:59:07,261
right.

1824
00:59:07,261 --> 00:59:08,220
We're talking about a job.

1825
00:59:08,221 --> 00:59:09,660
There's a lot of people that could do it.

1826
00:59:10,410 --> 00:59:11,760
I'm not saying it's an easy job,

1827
00:59:11,761 --> 00:59:13,620
but I'm saying there's a
lot of people that are,

1828
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:15,390
have a real understanding of boxing.

1829
00:59:15,530 --> 00:59:17,070
They would have done a way better job.

1830
00:59:17,110 --> 00:59:17,411
I mean,

1831
00:59:17,411 --> 00:59:18,400
somebody robs a bank.

1832
00:59:18,401 --> 00:59:20,020
They're not your bank
teller the next week.

1833
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:22,093
Exactly.

1834
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:23,263
Exactly.

1835
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:24,350
Well,

1836
00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:26,450
at all the promoters today is golden boy.

1837
00:59:26,451 --> 00:59:27,050
The best.

1838
00:59:27,050 --> 00:59:27,321
I mean,

1839
00:59:27,321 --> 00:59:28,640
at least Oscar de la Hoya,

1840
00:59:28,641 --> 00:59:29,540
Bernard Hopkins,

1841
00:59:29,550 --> 00:59:32,000
they're legit world champion fighters.

1842
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:35,510
They have a dis attached to,

1843
00:59:35,511 --> 00:59:36,200
they got one.

1844
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,940
They got to strengthen and got a weakness.

1845
00:59:37,941 --> 00:59:42,350
Their weakness is they attached
really attached at the hip to one.

1846
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:43,020
You know,

1847
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:44,270
there are solar system,

1848
00:59:44,271 --> 00:59:44,931
so to speak,

1849
00:59:44,931 --> 00:59:47,960
has one son and I sign is called Canelo.

1850
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:51,160
Canelo disappears tomorrow
and they're fucked.

1851
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:52,710
Yeah,

1852
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,193
they're not happy.

1853
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:55,220
They got some problems.

1854
00:59:55,221 --> 00:59:57,470
But listen now Hayman's out there,

1855
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:58,311
you know,

1856
00:59:58,311 --> 00:59:58,641
he,

1857
00:59:58,641 --> 00:59:59,660
he's PBC.

1858
00:59:59,720 --> 00:59:59,990
You know,

1859
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:00,823
he came along,

1860
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:01,773
um,

1861
01:00:01,850 --> 01:00:04,100
he just signed a deal from what I read.

1862
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:05,293
Um,

1863
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:09,320
I think I'm saying the numbers right
where Fox gave him $50 million for a four

1864
01:00:09,321 --> 01:00:14,321
year deal to put fights out there and
he's probably got the best stable of

1865
01:00:14,421 --> 01:00:14,841
fighters.

1866
01:00:14,841 --> 01:00:15,021
I mean,

1867
01:00:15,021 --> 01:00:16,270
he's a,

1868
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:17,840
he's got what the guy hasn't been fine,

1869
01:00:17,841 --> 01:00:20,360
but to guy was I think
was one of the best guys.

1870
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:21,193
Thurman.

1871
01:00:21,550 --> 01:00:22,383
Um,

1872
01:00:22,550 --> 01:00:23,480
but you know,

1873
01:00:23,481 --> 01:00:25,280
he's got who I really loved.

1874
01:00:25,281 --> 01:00:26,150
His guy's a beast.

1875
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:27,090
My son loves him.

1876
01:00:27,450 --> 01:00:27,740
Ah,

1877
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:29,100
Spence arose fans.

1878
01:00:29,570 --> 01:00:30,351
He's a beast.

1879
01:00:30,351 --> 01:00:30,621
I mean,

1880
01:00:30,621 --> 01:00:31,130
the guy,

1881
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:32,660
I like him inside and out.

1882
01:00:32,661 --> 01:00:33,471
What do I mean by that?

1883
01:00:33,471 --> 01:00:34,010
I mean,

1884
01:00:34,010 --> 01:00:36,680
he truly believes that he
should fight all the best.

1885
01:00:36,830 --> 01:00:38,240
He truly believes he's the best.

1886
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:40,010
He truly believes he's
going to get to you.

1887
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:41,053
You know what I mean?

1888
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:42,350
And any fights that way.

1889
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:43,250
And he's a great guy.

1890
01:00:43,730 --> 01:00:44,563
He's a good guy.

1891
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:45,493
He's a good guy.

1892
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:46,990
So it's cool.

1893
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:48,153
Yeah,

1894
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:49,190
it makes it better.

1895
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:49,341
Yeah.

1896
01:00:49,341 --> 01:00:49,851
He's fun.

1897
01:00:49,851 --> 01:00:50,684
Got a big smile.

1898
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:50,991
Yeah.

1899
01:00:50,991 --> 01:00:51,390
Yeah,

1900
01:00:51,390 --> 01:00:52,130
it's better.

1901
01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:52,940
You know,

1902
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,530
Terrence Crawford is another one out.

1903
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:57,590
And so,

1904
01:00:57,980 --> 01:00:59,650
I mean haven's got a lotta,

1905
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:01,760
he's also got wilder
and heavyweight champ,

1906
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:02,720
but one of the champs,

1907
01:01:02,721 --> 01:01:03,554
whatever that is.

1908
01:01:03,590 --> 01:01:05,180
But what a,

1909
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:07,400
technically he's got a lot of problems,

1910
01:01:07,401 --> 01:01:11,830
but he's kind of one thing that's
not a problem and confidence.

1911
01:01:11,930 --> 01:01:12,763
But one other thing,

1912
01:01:12,830 --> 01:01:13,670
oh my goodness.

1913
01:01:14,590 --> 01:01:15,423
He's thought

1914
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:19,850
instead of a hammer,

1915
01:01:19,851 --> 01:01:20,684
it's the right hand.

1916
01:01:23,330 --> 01:01:24,320
Oh my goodness.

1917
01:01:24,321 --> 01:01:24,780
He,

1918
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:26,690
oh listen,

1919
01:01:26,691 --> 01:01:28,300
I am mother fucker knocks out everybody,

1920
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:28,641
man.

1921
01:01:28,641 --> 01:01:28,911
He,

1922
01:01:28,911 --> 01:01:30,010
if he hits you a,

1923
01:01:30,110 --> 01:01:31,920
and the Ortiz fight was very interesting,

1924
01:01:31,930 --> 01:01:32,151
right?

1925
01:01:32,151 --> 01:01:36,680
He was her teeth today who is a bad
shape and still referee might have helped

1926
01:01:36,681 --> 01:01:37,190
him a little,

1927
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:38,280
but he was in bad shape.

1928
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:39,553
And uh,

1929
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:40,581
but boy,

1930
01:01:40,581 --> 01:01:41,414
oh boy hill,

1931
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:41,890
you know,

1932
01:01:41,890 --> 01:01:44,000
I say it a lot of times
he had that eraser,

1933
01:01:44,001 --> 01:01:44,480
you know,

1934
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:45,313
I remember,

1935
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:48,410
I remember I was not a great memory,

1936
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:49,580
but as a kid,

1937
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:53,750
somehow I wound up in a
Catholic school for a minute.

1938
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:55,640
And those nuns,

1939
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:57,820
they,

1940
01:01:57,820 --> 01:01:58,970
they should have been fighters.

1941
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:02,083
They were mean.

1942
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:03,710
They were mean.

1943
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:05,240
I think they were a little twisted,

1944
01:02:05,241 --> 01:02:05,691
some of them.

1945
01:02:05,691 --> 01:02:07,190
But I'm not going to go to,

1946
01:02:07,191 --> 01:02:08,090
but they were little,

1947
01:02:08,330 --> 01:02:09,163
they would mean,

1948
01:02:09,290 --> 01:02:12,680
but they had no problem hitting you
in the head with that black racer.

1949
01:02:13,170 --> 01:02:14,420
Like you won't Pay Bang.

1950
01:02:14,421 --> 01:02:15,170
It was just like,

1951
01:02:15,170 --> 01:02:15,951
and it was hard.

1952
01:02:15,951 --> 01:02:16,431
It was like,

1953
01:02:16,431 --> 01:02:17,264
I don't,

1954
01:02:17,450 --> 01:02:18,790
that's fine.

1955
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:21,273
You know.

1956
01:02:21,590 --> 01:02:22,830
And he has that eraser.

1957
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:23,913
That's the point on.

1958
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:27,720
He has done a razor where
bank put his technique,

1959
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:31,620
his feet come up on the tone,

1960
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:33,540
take the bear lands technique,

1961
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:34,440
bed power,

1962
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:35,430
good Sherlock log,

1963
01:02:35,431 --> 01:02:36,264
boom.

1964
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:36,990
Really?

1965
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:37,441
He lands.

1966
01:02:37,441 --> 01:02:38,390
People go flying.

1967
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:41,830
I mean giant heavyweight
either in terms of his smell,

1968
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:42,760
but you know what he is.

1969
01:02:42,761 --> 01:02:46,770
So he's long and he's tall
and he looked at those arms.

1970
01:02:46,830 --> 01:02:47,820
He was long.

1971
01:02:47,821 --> 01:02:49,170
I mean he could hear,

1972
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:50,480
he could hit you across the room.

1973
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:51,780
Well sows,

1974
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:52,650
Tyson fury.

1975
01:02:52,651 --> 01:02:54,840
And that's one of the things
that makes this fight very,

1976
01:02:54,841 --> 01:02:56,190
very interesting.

1977
01:02:56,550 --> 01:02:59,760
That's one of the times where
that's saying styles make fights.

1978
01:02:59,761 --> 01:03:00,270
That's going up.

1979
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:01,350
That's going to be this fight.

1980
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:02,940
That's going to be the whole thing.

1981
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:04,680
Tyson fury as a motherfucker.

1982
01:03:04,770 --> 01:03:04,921
Well,

1983
01:03:04,921 --> 01:03:05,620
he could move.

1984
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:05,831
Yeah.

1985
01:03:05,831 --> 01:03:06,661
It's not only six,

1986
01:03:06,661 --> 01:03:07,860
seven or whatever the hell he is,

1987
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:09,601
six,

1988
01:03:09,601 --> 01:03:10,434
eight,

1989
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:10,891
six,

1990
01:03:10,891 --> 01:03:11,790
nine long.

1991
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:13,740
But he can move each had legs.

1992
01:03:13,770 --> 01:03:14,510
Phenomenal.

1993
01:03:14,510 --> 01:03:15,010
Yeah.

1994
01:03:15,010 --> 01:03:17,550
Somebody forgot to tell me he's a
heavy because he moves around like a

1995
01:03:17,551 --> 01:03:21,200
lightweight and that could
be a problem until he gets,

1996
01:03:21,201 --> 01:03:23,790
it also talks tremendous
shit until he gets it.

1997
01:03:24,310 --> 01:03:24,911
Well then,

1998
01:03:24,911 --> 01:03:26,080
then things change.

1999
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:30,290
But I always used to say
when I was doing a broadcast,

2000
01:03:30,330 --> 01:03:30,710
so if I,

2001
01:03:30,710 --> 01:03:31,660
I would always say,

2002
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:34,000
and I,

2003
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:34,421
of course,

2004
01:03:34,421 --> 01:03:37,190
I wouldn't say it if I didn't
have a belief in us and,

2005
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:38,560
and the proof of it,

2006
01:03:38,561 --> 01:03:43,561
in my mind at least that punches are
born then I made you're born when you're

2007
01:03:44,770 --> 01:03:46,720
not born to be a punch of that level.

2008
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:48,850
And I'll tell you something funny that,

2009
01:03:48,851 --> 01:03:51,340
because you brought it up about him being,

2010
01:03:51,341 --> 01:03:51,581
you know,

2011
01:03:51,581 --> 01:03:52,240
he's not a big,

2012
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:52,541
you know,

2013
01:03:52,541 --> 01:03:55,990
he's not that prototypical big Husky,

2014
01:03:55,991 --> 01:03:56,824
you know,

2015
01:03:57,010 --> 01:03:57,843
uh,

2016
01:03:57,970 --> 01:03:58,271
you know,

2017
01:03:58,271 --> 01:03:59,104
wedged out.

2018
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:00,580
Yeah.

2019
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:01,450
He's not that right.

2020
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:04,900
But I'll tell you when
I was training fighters,

2021
01:04:04,901 --> 01:04:08,740
when I was young and I was taking them
to smokers in the Bronx to get experience

2022
01:04:09,610 --> 01:04:10,443
every week,

2023
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:12,460
tough places in the South Bronx,

2024
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:15,010
and we were taking them to these
unsanctioned fights just to get them

2025
01:04:15,011 --> 01:04:15,844
experience.

2026
01:04:16,030 --> 01:04:18,180
And if I didn't know the fight,

2027
01:04:18,181 --> 01:04:18,790
I say I had,

2028
01:04:18,790 --> 01:04:21,340
I'm responsible for these kids back then.

2029
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:23,590
I'm like their parent and their trust me,

2030
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:25,240
some of them didn't have parents,

2031
01:04:25,241 --> 01:04:26,080
but the ones that did,

2032
01:04:26,081 --> 01:04:27,640
they would trust me to
take care of this kid.

2033
01:04:27,850 --> 01:04:29,560
They didn't know what was
going to the South Bronx where,

2034
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:30,251
where,

2035
01:04:30,251 --> 01:04:31,210
I remember one time,

2036
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:31,680
uh,

2037
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:33,210
I bought a car from somebody,

2038
01:04:33,211 --> 01:04:34,630
they didn't have to cook enough car.

2039
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:36,400
It was the publisher of the newspaper,

2040
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:39,340
the Catskill Daily Mail.

2041
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:40,473
And,

2042
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:44,470
and I've gone through his name of the
publisher and I bought his station wagon.

2043
01:04:44,471 --> 01:04:46,450
I didn't have a car big
enough to take the kids.

2044
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:47,613
And um,

2045
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:48,911
as I'm leaving,

2046
01:04:48,911 --> 01:04:49,740
he says,

2047
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:50,031
it's,

2048
01:04:50,031 --> 01:04:52,930
you're not taking a real bad place
where they'd like rob hubcaps.

2049
01:04:52,931 --> 01:04:53,540
So something.

2050
01:04:53,540 --> 01:04:54,281
And I was like,

2051
01:04:54,281 --> 01:04:54,820
no,

2052
01:04:54,820 --> 01:04:57,760
because I didn't think I was lying
because to me they brought the whole car.

2053
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:02,673
So,

2054
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:05,490
so I said no because
he left it at hubcaps.

2055
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:05,830
Right.

2056
01:05:05,830 --> 01:05:06,680
So I said no.

2057
01:05:08,810 --> 01:05:10,390
So I get there in the first thing I did,

2058
01:05:10,390 --> 01:05:11,450
I do is I pull the,

2059
01:05:11,451 --> 01:05:11,751
you know,

2060
01:05:11,751 --> 01:05:15,800
underneath the l you know for people
don't know is to train subway in the train

2061
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:17,680
and I underneath and,

2062
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:18,963
and uh,

2063
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:19,451
that was,

2064
01:05:19,451 --> 01:05:20,950
you talk about life grown up quick.

2065
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:26,770
You in one night it was like live reading
chapters of a book to you went through

2066
01:05:26,771 --> 01:05:30,790
different things and you learn different
things about yourself and about what's

2067
01:05:30,791 --> 01:05:31,540
there,

2068
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:34,570
what you don't see a and
you haven't been around,

2069
01:05:34,571 --> 01:05:39,520
but it's there and it's good to know
it's there a different life to different

2070
01:05:39,521 --> 01:05:40,354
way.

2071
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:41,980
And I'm down in the South Bronx and,

2072
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:43,720
and our first thing I did,

2073
01:05:43,721 --> 01:05:45,700
I went to Mrs. Santos who was the father,

2074
01:05:45,701 --> 01:05:46,534
one of my kids.

2075
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:47,520
I went to his ball,

2076
01:05:47,521 --> 01:05:48,261
cross the street,

2077
01:05:48,261 --> 01:05:49,080
said Mrs Central,

2078
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:50,050
my cars over there.

2079
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:51,273
Gotcha.

2080
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:52,990
And why come out?

2081
01:05:53,050 --> 01:05:55,390
And all the batteries of the
cars were client except mine

2082
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:57,933
quite often.

2083
01:05:58,390 --> 01:05:59,223
And uh,

2084
01:05:59,590 --> 01:06:00,520
but my car was good.

2085
01:06:01,220 --> 01:06:04,810
It's the Santos and his crew made
sure that nobody took my battery.

2086
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:07,120
And so we were good.

2087
01:06:07,510 --> 01:06:10,390
So I was looking out for the kids
because I did what I had to do,

2088
01:06:10,391 --> 01:06:11,500
but it was a scary place.

2089
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:12,400
It was a tough place.

2090
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:13,773
And um,

2091
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:14,840
the kids grew up fast.

2092
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:19,480
It was three flights and it was often
thought that it was meant to be three

2093
01:06:19,481 --> 01:06:22,060
flights because she had time
to think during those flights.

2094
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:22,841
The first flight,

2095
01:06:22,841 --> 01:06:23,674
quite frankly,

2096
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:26,080
are you saw syringes,

2097
01:06:26,770 --> 01:06:29,110
sometimes kids didn't or non bad.

2098
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:30,460
These kids will Catskill New York,

2099
01:06:30,630 --> 01:06:32,980
they really syringes

2100
01:06:35,410 --> 01:06:35,711
then.

2101
01:06:35,711 --> 01:06:36,491
Then the next flight,

2102
01:06:36,491 --> 01:06:36,911
you know,

2103
01:06:36,911 --> 01:06:39,490
you smelled urine because
people were there.

2104
01:06:39,491 --> 01:06:40,660
They went up there and they were,

2105
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:41,320
you know,

2106
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:42,160
going to bathroom,

2107
01:06:42,161 --> 01:06:46,120
doing whatever and shooting
up or whatever and you smell.

2108
01:06:47,110 --> 01:06:48,850
But then by the time
you get to dirt flight,

2109
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:51,010
you've started to hear noise,

2110
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:53,350
started to hear salsa music

2111
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:55,950
and you,

2112
01:06:55,951 --> 01:06:56,590
uh,

2113
01:06:56,590 --> 01:06:57,580
you could smell some.

2114
01:06:58,270 --> 01:06:58,661
There were,

2115
01:06:58,661 --> 01:07:00,850
they were cooking all
the Spanish specialties,

2116
01:07:01,570 --> 01:07:04,240
the A to five bananas,

2117
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:06,093
the uh,

2118
01:07:06,730 --> 01:07:07,810
the meat with the,

2119
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:11,970
with the potato in the middle
plantaris and all that.

2120
01:07:11,970 --> 01:07:12,760
I remember,

2121
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:13,060
you know,

2122
01:07:13,060 --> 01:07:14,110
I don't remember what the names,

2123
01:07:14,111 --> 01:07:15,660
but all the different inn,

2124
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:16,503
of course,

2125
01:07:16,510 --> 01:07:17,343
a lot of Rome,

2126
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:18,893
a lot of,

2127
01:07:19,210 --> 01:07:20,043
there was a bar,

2128
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:21,730
but that's how they kept,

2129
01:07:21,910 --> 01:07:25,480
that's how they paid the rent for the
gym because they would do these smokers

2130
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:26,373
twice a month.

2131
01:07:26,890 --> 01:07:27,101
You know,

2132
01:07:27,101 --> 01:07:28,930
there was a smoke every week in New York.

2133
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:29,741
Every week.

2134
01:07:29,741 --> 01:07:30,970
People had to know where they were,

2135
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:32,830
but they were every week.

2136
01:07:33,310 --> 01:07:33,851
And Leah,

2137
01:07:33,851 --> 01:07:34,720
they won't sanction.

2138
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:35,800
There was no doctrine.

2139
01:07:36,070 --> 01:07:36,371
Listen,

2140
01:07:36,371 --> 01:07:37,600
I'm going out there and saying,

2141
01:07:37,601 --> 01:07:37,960
yeah,

2142
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:39,340
that don't sound too good.

2143
01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:41,110
I got you.

2144
01:07:41,710 --> 01:07:42,640
But we made it good.

2145
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:44,410
Yeah,

2146
01:07:44,410 --> 01:07:45,131
we made it good.

2147
01:07:45,131 --> 01:07:46,370
We made sure we took care of,

2148
01:07:46,510 --> 01:07:46,790
we've,

2149
01:07:46,790 --> 01:07:47,560
we've made it.

2150
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:48,790
I know it was still dangerous.

2151
01:07:48,791 --> 01:07:49,600
It was stolen,

2152
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:51,040
but you want to know something?

2153
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:54,370
A kid drinking a bottle of vodka a
day was pretty freaking dangerous.

2154
01:07:54,790 --> 01:07:55,623
Okay.

2155
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:58,390
I had some idiot one time.

2156
01:07:58,540 --> 01:08:02,700
I was trying to get money
from my foundation and I
was explaining to him and he

2157
01:08:02,710 --> 01:08:05,350
was a political guy and I was
explaining to him and he goes,

2158
01:08:05,410 --> 01:08:06,960
have you got brain damage and bugs?

2159
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:11,980
And it's very day like I was trying to
like you when you want to throw your

2160
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:13,660
headset when you see these trucks.

2161
01:08:13,870 --> 01:08:14,980
I was like trying to control,

2162
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:16,153
I'm trying to talk to them.

2163
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:17,960
I supposed to talk the right guy,

2164
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:18,440
wait,

2165
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:20,410
this guy who I'm going to
get money from my foundation,

2166
01:08:20,411 --> 01:08:21,620
it helps these people.

2167
01:08:21,650 --> 01:08:22,310
Right.

2168
01:08:22,310 --> 01:08:24,290
So I'm trying to talk
to him and I'm saying,

2169
01:08:25,270 --> 01:08:26,103
um,

2170
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:30,530
do you get brain damage from being out
in the street and getting hit with a pipe

2171
01:08:30,531 --> 01:08:32,600
to get by deed because there's
the people I'm helping.

2172
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,570
Do you get brain damage
arm from doing crack?

2173
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:37,820
Do you get brain damage?

2174
01:08:37,821 --> 01:08:41,480
I did have a kid who drank a bottle
of vodka now when he gave to him to my

2175
01:08:41,481 --> 01:08:43,310
program and the foundation that we run,

2176
01:08:43,670 --> 01:08:44,503
uh,

2177
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:45,980
for two years,

2178
01:08:45,981 --> 01:08:47,510
he's been announced three years,

2179
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:50,030
he's been clean or his back was family.

2180
01:08:50,030 --> 01:08:51,230
He was living on the streets.

2181
01:08:51,410 --> 01:08:56,410
He was with gangs and when he got
into boxing in one of our programs,

2182
01:08:56,780 --> 01:08:57,340
uh,

2183
01:08:57,340 --> 01:08:57,790
he,

2184
01:08:57,790 --> 01:08:58,790
he stopped all that,

2185
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,040
but he was drinking a
bottle of vodka years.

2186
01:09:01,041 --> 01:09:01,400
True.

2187
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:02,001
15 year.

2188
01:09:02,001 --> 01:09:02,200
Yeah.

2189
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:02,781
A lot of people say,

2190
01:09:02,781 --> 01:09:03,080
Teddy,

2191
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:03,913
how do you drink?

2192
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:04,850
Yeah,

2193
01:09:04,850 --> 01:09:05,683
but he was,

2194
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:07,011
how do you do it?

2195
01:09:07,011 --> 01:09:09,140
Because you have a lot of
pain maybe or whatever,

2196
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:10,033
whatever.

2197
01:09:10,310 --> 01:09:10,791
But yeah,

2198
01:09:10,791 --> 01:09:11,624
he was,

2199
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:12,830
and so I was,

2200
01:09:12,890 --> 01:09:14,000
I said to the guy who was trying,

2201
01:09:14,001 --> 01:09:15,110
not to get into an argument,

2202
01:09:15,111 --> 01:09:15,944
but I was like,

2203
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:18,560
boxing causes brain damage,

2204
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:20,780
but I'm taking guys away.

2205
01:09:21,050 --> 01:09:26,050
Kids said the alternative is to
bottle of vodka to crack the needle,

2206
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:31,550
the pipe on the head or maybe the pipe
on someone else's head where they caused

2207
01:09:31,570 --> 01:09:33,020
brain damage to someone else.

2208
01:09:33,530 --> 01:09:33,830
Maybe.

2209
01:09:33,830 --> 01:09:34,161
Maybe.

2210
01:09:34,161 --> 01:09:36,800
Unfortunately you'll one day
walking out of your house.

2211
01:09:37,820 --> 01:09:40,070
What about that brain damage?

2212
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:45,050
That's your way of telling me know
that your way of not giving me what I'm

2213
01:09:45,051 --> 01:09:46,940
asking for to say that.

2214
01:09:47,770 --> 01:09:49,520
Why don't you think it
out a little bit more?

2215
01:09:49,610 --> 01:09:52,970
Why don't you think it out a little
more and give me a better excuse?

2216
01:09:54,110 --> 01:09:56,210
Why don't you at least
understand what we're doing.

2217
01:09:56,450 --> 01:09:57,283
Yeah.

2218
01:09:57,920 --> 01:09:59,420
There's a reason why we're doing this.

2219
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:01,491
So these kids,

2220
01:10:01,491 --> 01:10:02,324
we would go,

2221
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:07,820
we would go to the south
Bronx and these kids would,

2222
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:09,673
they'd walk up,

2223
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:10,551
like I said,

2224
01:10:10,551 --> 01:10:13,590
they've woke up to steps by
time that door opened up and,

2225
01:10:13,610 --> 01:10:18,610
and again this is how they paid
the rent by selling liquor,

2226
01:10:19,730 --> 01:10:20,421
by charging,

2227
01:10:20,421 --> 01:10:24,470
treat hours to get in
and selling that food.

2228
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:26,570
And a place would be packed,

2229
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:27,973
packed.

2230
01:10:28,580 --> 01:10:29,720
And when the l went by,

2231
01:10:29,721 --> 01:10:30,554
you talk about,

2232
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:31,201
you told me,

2233
01:10:31,201 --> 01:10:33,530
we talked a little bit
about pressure and about,

2234
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:34,573
you know,

2235
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:35,930
what pressure does to you.

2236
01:10:36,050 --> 01:10:37,010
It can form,

2237
01:10:37,011 --> 01:10:38,390
you could destroy,

2238
01:10:38,391 --> 01:10:40,460
you could form,

2239
01:10:40,461 --> 01:10:43,160
you can make you realize
what you're capable of.

2240
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:44,260
You know,

2241
01:10:44,260 --> 01:10:46,730
the greatest thing about what [inaudible]
and does for somebody who makes them

2242
01:10:46,731 --> 01:10:47,150
know,

2243
01:10:47,150 --> 01:10:47,451
Teddy,

2244
01:10:47,451 --> 01:10:48,620
what is box and do for you?

2245
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:49,810
Oh those are your jabs.

2246
01:10:49,811 --> 01:10:51,320
You do know your condition,

2247
01:10:51,321 --> 01:10:52,430
you take care of your temple,

2248
01:10:52,431 --> 01:10:52,911
your body,

2249
01:10:52,911 --> 01:10:53,570
all that stuff.

2250
01:10:53,570 --> 01:10:53,781
Yeah,

2251
01:10:53,781 --> 01:10:54,614
it sounds good.

2252
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:55,731
Teddy,

2253
01:10:55,731 --> 01:10:57,540
give us one thing that
box and does forever.

2254
01:10:57,730 --> 01:10:59,750
It lets you know you
could depend on yourself.

2255
01:11:02,310 --> 01:11:04,260
Lets a kid know that he can like himself.

2256
01:11:04,950 --> 01:11:05,431
We don't know.

2257
01:11:05,431 --> 01:11:07,470
He can like himself and depend on himself.

2258
01:11:07,530 --> 01:11:08,363
These kids.

2259
01:11:09,150 --> 01:11:09,983
So

2260
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:12,251
was it rough?

2261
01:11:12,251 --> 01:11:12,831
He was rough.

2262
01:11:12,831 --> 01:11:17,520
So we're in a place and
there's is no doctor here.

2263
01:11:17,521 --> 01:11:19,560
We had no sanction and organization.

2264
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:20,850
We made own fights,

2265
01:11:22,740 --> 01:11:24,240
but there was a danger.

2266
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:26,250
But I just told you the other dangers,

2267
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:31,110
this was taken them and replacing those
other dangers too is taking them away

2268
01:11:31,111 --> 01:11:31,620
from the,

2269
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:32,011
you know what?

2270
01:11:32,011 --> 01:11:35,580
It was the only positive thing in
the neighborhood for these kids.

2271
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:36,593
It really was,

2272
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:37,320
was a rough,

2273
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:38,153
yeah,

2274
01:11:38,690 --> 01:11:39,523
suboxone.

2275
01:11:40,410 --> 01:11:42,420
But I just talked about life is rough,

2276
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:45,420
especially for these people refer.

2277
01:11:46,170 --> 01:11:49,310
So it was an alternative to violence.

2278
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:49,831
People say,

2279
01:11:49,831 --> 01:11:50,131
Teddy,

2280
01:11:50,131 --> 01:11:50,810
what are you talking about?

2281
01:11:50,810 --> 01:11:52,620
Bhags no,

2282
01:11:53,490 --> 01:11:54,540
because if you're angry,

2283
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:55,890
which these kids are,

2284
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:58,500
if they don't learn to lose that anger,

2285
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:02,850
they never become anything in boxing
because they walk in and get head.

2286
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:05,340
They learned that they
can control that anger.

2287
01:12:05,341 --> 01:12:06,390
They could put it somewhere.

2288
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:10,200
They learned that they
can control themselves.

2289
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:14,130
They can depend on themselves
to be something positive.

2290
01:12:15,150 --> 01:12:19,740
So I would take these kids and we would
go there and we were the only white kids

2291
01:12:19,741 --> 01:12:20,574
in the place.

2292
01:12:22,410 --> 01:12:23,730
And they loved us.

2293
01:12:24,990 --> 01:12:25,711
They were funny.

2294
01:12:25,711 --> 01:12:26,131
Like I said,

2295
01:12:26,131 --> 01:12:26,821
the guy who ran it,

2296
01:12:26,821 --> 01:12:27,654
Nelson quavers,

2297
01:12:27,870 --> 01:12:28,201
he would,

2298
01:12:28,201 --> 01:12:28,891
he's a great guy,

2299
01:12:28,891 --> 01:12:29,221
but he,

2300
01:12:29,221 --> 01:12:30,000
you know,

2301
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:30,601
I would look,

2302
01:12:30,601 --> 01:12:35,601
he carried a gun in his holster and
it's in his belt felt because he knew it

2303
01:12:35,611 --> 01:12:36,444
could be rough.

2304
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:37,621
I mean,

2305
01:12:37,621 --> 01:12:38,610
I did,

2306
01:12:38,611 --> 01:12:42,720
I leave that part out to the parents
when I was taking him that the proprietor

2307
01:12:42,721 --> 01:12:43,554
of the place,

2308
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:43,890
you know,

2309
01:12:43,890 --> 01:12:46,020
has a gun and every once in
a while he opens his jacket,

2310
01:12:46,770 --> 01:12:49,680
make sure that the people
remember that he has.

2311
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:50,220
Yeah.

2312
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:51,053
Alright.

2313
01:12:51,510 --> 01:12:53,190
But they looked out for you.

2314
01:12:53,191 --> 01:12:54,024
They,

2315
01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:55,103
the kids.

2316
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:55,890
I know,

2317
01:12:55,890 --> 01:12:57,270
I know it sounds contrary.

2318
01:12:57,271 --> 01:12:58,860
I get it contradictory,

2319
01:12:58,861 --> 01:13:00,210
but it was a,

2320
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:01,530
these kids,

2321
01:13:02,490 --> 01:13:04,860
they learned so much about
themselves and we protect,

2322
01:13:04,861 --> 01:13:05,460
I looked at,

2323
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:06,293
we'd looked out for,

2324
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:10,530
and when it came time to
make the matches to point,

2325
01:13:10,531 --> 01:13:11,700
I was making about Walden.

2326
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:13,790
And you talked about
being long and about you.

2327
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:15,420
I'm sorry I jump all over the place.

2328
01:13:15,890 --> 01:13:16,723
But uh,

2329
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:17,840
I,

2330
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:18,100
oh,

2331
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:18,933
I learned,

2332
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:21,300
cause taught me this.

2333
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:22,920
But you have to learn it yourself.

2334
01:13:23,610 --> 01:13:24,443
You have to see it.

2335
01:13:24,810 --> 01:13:26,970
You have to be in it
because told me about it.

2336
01:13:27,180 --> 01:13:28,230
But that's only part of it.

2337
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:30,631
He always told me,

2338
01:13:30,631 --> 01:13:31,350
teddy,

2339
01:13:31,350 --> 01:13:33,500
be careful with skinny wirey guys.

2340
01:13:34,170 --> 01:13:35,910
They had the greatest punches.

2341
01:13:37,470 --> 01:13:38,251
Think I was thinking,

2342
01:13:38,251 --> 01:13:39,240
you know this,

2343
01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:41,520
they're the greatest punches.

2344
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:43,860
He never told me why he
let me figure it out.

2345
01:13:44,190 --> 01:13:45,023
I saw it.

2346
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:48,240
I saw when he get him out.

2347
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:49,680
Yeah.

2348
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:50,371
You know what I mean?

2349
01:13:50,371 --> 01:13:51,204
Hearns here,

2350
01:13:51,810 --> 01:13:53,910
but I know why now leverage.

2351
01:13:53,940 --> 01:13:54,773
Yeah,

2352
01:13:54,870 --> 01:13:55,620
talk,

2353
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:56,071
talk,

2354
01:13:56,071 --> 01:13:56,904
whatever you call that.

2355
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:58,290
And so anyway,

2356
01:13:58,291 --> 01:13:59,310
so here we are.

2357
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:02,220
And if you saw the guy you
knew who to match with,

2358
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:03,900
but if you didn't see the guy,

2359
01:14:05,610 --> 01:14:07,440
you had to depend on other things.

2360
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:09,173
Who's the coach?

2361
01:14:09,330 --> 01:14:10,920
Certain coaches had no good fighters.

2362
01:14:10,930 --> 01:14:11,511
Certain coaches,

2363
01:14:11,511 --> 01:14:12,344
they're good fighters.

2364
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:14,073
Another coach.

2365
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:17,260
Does he have a good
realize he honest sea lion.

2366
01:14:18,130 --> 01:14:19,030
Does he have,

2367
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:25,890
does he have an opinion that is
good or does he just say things?

2368
01:14:26,980 --> 01:14:30,010
So I'd have to go to all that
if I didn't know the guy,

2369
01:14:30,011 --> 01:14:34,180
I wouldn't put my kid in with the
guy unless I was sure what he was.

2370
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:35,373
Sure.

2371
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:38,860
And it was hard because
everyone was lying though.

2372
01:14:38,861 --> 01:14:39,910
There was like a cold.

2373
01:14:40,790 --> 01:14:42,850
It was all connected
to lion unfortunately.

2374
01:14:43,050 --> 01:14:43,883
But,

2375
01:14:44,020 --> 01:14:45,640
but everyone looking out for their kid,

2376
01:14:45,790 --> 01:14:47,140
like if you'd said it,

2377
01:14:47,470 --> 01:14:50,140
I'll give you an example because
we guess who the matchmaker was.

2378
01:14:51,190 --> 01:14:53,970
I became the matchmaker with,

2379
01:14:54,050 --> 01:14:54,370
you know,

2380
01:14:54,370 --> 01:14:55,930
in a place where all Spanish black,

2381
01:14:56,140 --> 01:14:56,470
white,

2382
01:14:56,470 --> 01:14:58,360
but Nelson made me the matchmaker.

2383
01:14:58,420 --> 01:15:01,720
You be the matchmaker and a lot of
the people didn't speak English.

2384
01:15:01,721 --> 01:15:02,680
So you know,

2385
01:15:02,681 --> 01:15:02,911
we've,

2386
01:15:02,911 --> 01:15:04,330
we figured out we get there.

2387
01:15:05,140 --> 01:15:06,470
So I'd be the,

2388
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:08,440
so you make a column,

2389
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:09,760
the name of the fighter.

2390
01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:10,653
The weight.

2391
01:15:10,690 --> 01:15:10,961
Yeah.

2392
01:15:10,961 --> 01:15:12,250
He saw you your way him,

2393
01:15:12,251 --> 01:15:12,551
you know,

2394
01:15:12,551 --> 01:15:13,181
that's one thing.

2395
01:15:13,181 --> 01:15:13,780
You see it.

2396
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:14,200
Okay.

2397
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:15,130
That's the only truth.

2398
01:15:15,910 --> 01:15:18,220
The rest of it got dicey.

2399
01:15:18,610 --> 01:15:18,911
Okay.

2400
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:20,710
How many fights most important thing?

2401
01:15:20,711 --> 01:15:22,030
Most important thing.

2402
01:15:22,031 --> 01:15:22,864
How many fights?

2403
01:15:23,530 --> 01:15:24,363
Zero.

2404
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:26,470
Everyone in this place got zero fights

2405
01:15:29,050 --> 01:15:31,060
and Al Said nobody got
fights in its place.

2406
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,650
Even doing this for years.

2407
01:15:33,690 --> 01:15:35,260
It's all okay,

2408
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:36,213
here's the code.

2409
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:38,170
Zero fights means two or three.

2410
01:15:40,540 --> 01:15:40,841
One,

2411
01:15:40,841 --> 01:15:44,140
two or three fights meant six to 10

2412
01:15:46,030 --> 01:15:48,880
God forbid anyone ever said they had five,

2413
01:15:48,881 --> 01:15:49,750
six fights,

2414
01:15:50,350 --> 01:15:53,440
anywhere from 25 to a hundred

2415
01:15:59,320 --> 01:15:59,920
real,

2416
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:00,370
real.

2417
01:16:00,370 --> 01:16:02,080
This is the world that
I lived in for five,

2418
01:16:02,081 --> 01:16:02,914
six years.

2419
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:05,020
Took them every Friday,

2420
01:16:05,050 --> 01:16:10,050
every drove down to the Bronx
and got them a smoker every week.

2421
01:16:10,810 --> 01:16:14,020
And so you figured out
to code after awhile,

2422
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:20,040
but you're responsible for these kids
who you wanted every tangible thing you

2423
01:16:20,141 --> 01:16:20,974
could have.

2424
01:16:21,010 --> 01:16:21,700
So again,

2425
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:26,110
if I wasn't sure how much the guy was
lying that he was lying a little extra,

2426
01:16:26,350 --> 01:16:27,183
I would,

2427
01:16:27,490 --> 01:16:28,480
I'd go to Nelson.

2428
01:16:28,481 --> 01:16:29,290
You know this guy?

2429
01:16:29,290 --> 01:16:29,501
No,

2430
01:16:29,501 --> 01:16:30,700
but talk to Pablo.

2431
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:32,291
Talk down.

2432
01:16:32,291 --> 01:16:33,124
Hell,

2433
01:16:33,610 --> 01:16:34,443
all right.

2434
01:16:34,870 --> 01:16:35,703
You know the guy?

2435
01:16:36,580 --> 01:16:36,970
No.

2436
01:16:36,970 --> 01:16:37,540
Yeah,

2437
01:16:37,540 --> 01:16:40,120
he's stay away from no fight.

2438
01:16:40,630 --> 01:16:40,900
You know,

2439
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:41,980
because I'm not taking the chair.

2440
01:16:42,790 --> 01:16:45,160
But then when you get to the
point where you don't really know,

2441
01:16:46,990 --> 01:16:48,220
then I would just,

2442
01:16:48,221 --> 01:16:49,330
your instincts come alive.

2443
01:16:50,350 --> 01:16:51,310
You're protecting your kid.

2444
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:52,090
It's your kid,

2445
01:16:52,090 --> 01:16:52,901
it's your kid.

2446
01:16:52,901 --> 01:16:55,060
As much as it's paternally your kid,

2447
01:16:55,090 --> 01:16:56,140
it's your kid.

2448
01:16:57,610 --> 01:16:59,440
I remember one time I went up to the guy,

2449
01:16:59,441 --> 01:17:00,830
I couldn't get enough info.

2450
01:17:01,270 --> 01:17:02,230
I went up to the guy

2451
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:08,890
bought Nelson as an interpreter because
he didn't speak English and I said

2452
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:11,000
I know what we do here.

2453
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:16,430
Well I'm telling you is I'm not
putting my kid in to get beat up.

2454
01:17:16,940 --> 01:17:17,631
If it's fair,

2455
01:17:17,631 --> 01:17:20,900
it's fair by not putting them in
with a kid that's got 30 40 fights.

2456
01:17:20,901 --> 01:17:24,950
My kid legitimate
legitimately has two fights.

2457
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:25,993
I'm telling you,

2458
01:17:26,570 --> 01:17:27,890
I know we don't do that here.

2459
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:30,290
I'm telling you that's what he's got.

2460
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:32,240
If your kid's got 40 foot,

2461
01:17:32,241 --> 01:17:33,074
tell me,

2462
01:17:33,530 --> 01:17:35,690
just tell me and say no fight and,

2463
01:17:36,010 --> 01:17:38,390
and I'll shake your hand and that's it.

2464
01:17:38,870 --> 01:17:39,703
We're good.

2465
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,170
So he kept,

2466
01:17:42,171 --> 01:17:43,490
he stood to his story.

2467
01:17:44,420 --> 01:17:45,253
Okay,

2468
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,770
so we get close in.

2469
01:17:47,771 --> 01:17:48,431
Now I'm thinking,

2470
01:17:48,431 --> 01:17:48,941
I'm thinking,

2471
01:17:48,941 --> 01:17:52,060
I'm thinking and I'm watching a
guy warmup cause always told me,

2472
01:17:52,061 --> 01:17:53,290
watch the Guy Walmart,

2473
01:17:54,070 --> 01:17:55,150
watch them warm up.

2474
01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:58,620
I want you to more more pop pop pop by

2475
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:01,050
bap.

2476
01:18:01,050 --> 01:18:01,320
Bap,

2477
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:02,153
bap.

2478
01:18:02,380 --> 01:18:04,540
I said this guy didn't have to fight.

2479
01:18:05,590 --> 01:18:05,951
I mean,

2480
01:18:05,951 --> 01:18:10,060
I'm a pretty good trainer
and even with our fights,

2481
01:18:10,061 --> 01:18:13,120
I think I teach them technically what
they need to know before they get to

2482
01:18:13,130 --> 01:18:13,750
explore.

2483
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:16,360
But this guy was beyond that.

2484
01:18:17,470 --> 01:18:18,070
I mean,

2485
01:18:18,070 --> 01:18:19,780
you know this was sugar ray Robinson.

2486
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:22,780
So I go back to Nelson.

2487
01:18:22,781 --> 01:18:23,021
I said,

2488
01:18:23,021 --> 01:18:25,630
bring him over here again
10 minutes before the fight.

2489
01:18:27,010 --> 01:18:28,090
So bring them over here again.

2490
01:18:29,050 --> 01:18:29,883
Comes on,

2491
01:18:30,230 --> 01:18:33,100
or a little bit of an attitude so bad.

2492
01:18:33,101 --> 01:18:34,720
Everyone's got attitudes in this business.

2493
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:36,191
Is it?

2494
01:18:36,191 --> 01:18:37,024
Hey

2495
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:39,093
listen

2496
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:41,313
one more time.

2497
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:45,620
I just want to tell you
not threatening you,

2498
01:18:46,940 --> 01:18:48,200
but I have to tell you this.

2499
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:51,700
It told me he's got no fights,

2500
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:52,181
whatever,

2501
01:18:52,181 --> 01:18:52,690
to five,

2502
01:18:52,690 --> 01:18:53,523
whatever.

2503
01:18:53,890 --> 01:18:55,060
When the bell rings,

2504
01:18:56,050 --> 01:18:57,310
if you got over on me,

2505
01:18:58,420 --> 01:18:59,111
I was wrong.

2506
01:18:59,111 --> 01:18:59,944
You were right.

2507
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:01,630
Soon as the bell rings,

2508
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:02,464
I'm going to see,

2509
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:03,953
I'm going to know it.

2510
01:19:05,590 --> 01:19:08,950
There's not new can say
afterwards to say to explain it,

2511
01:19:09,820 --> 01:19:10,653
handle it,

2512
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:14,830
and I'll stop to fight if I have
to because I'll protect my kid.

2513
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:16,910
I might have to.

2514
01:19:16,911 --> 01:19:17,381
I do that.

2515
01:19:17,381 --> 01:19:18,490
I'll be coming over to you.

2516
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:21,010
That's all I'm going to say.

2517
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:22,860
Okay.

2518
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:23,880
So please,

2519
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:25,560
please for you.

2520
01:19:25,561 --> 01:19:26,394
For me,

2521
01:19:26,970 --> 01:19:27,803
please.

2522
01:19:30,470 --> 01:19:31,303
If it's,

2523
01:19:31,490 --> 01:19:32,323
if it's,

2524
01:19:32,330 --> 01:19:33,530
if it's what I'm saying,

2525
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:35,090
please just,

2526
01:19:35,330 --> 01:19:35,871
just tell him,

2527
01:19:35,871 --> 01:19:36,291
Nelson,

2528
01:19:36,291 --> 01:19:37,250
you don't have to tell me.

2529
01:19:38,420 --> 01:19:42,610
Just tell Nelsa when I leave here
that we're not going to fight.

2530
01:19:44,330 --> 01:19:45,980
Nelson came back to me four minutes,

2531
01:19:45,981 --> 01:19:46,461
three minutes,

2532
01:19:46,461 --> 01:19:47,450
two minutes later and said,

2533
01:19:48,260 --> 01:19:49,093
he said no fight.

2534
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:50,151
Thank you.

2535
01:19:50,151 --> 01:19:51,020
Tell him thank you.

2536
01:19:51,850 --> 01:19:52,950
Tell him thank you.

2537
01:19:54,890 --> 01:19:56,270
That's the world we lived in there,

2538
01:19:57,110 --> 01:19:58,010
but we got it done.

2539
01:19:58,250 --> 01:19:59,210
We got it done though,

2540
01:19:59,211 --> 01:20:00,044
Joe.

2541
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:00,890
We did.

2542
01:20:00,890 --> 01:20:01,723
We really did.

2543
01:20:02,270 --> 01:20:06,410
And thank God that someone like you was
able to understand that there is a big

2544
01:20:06,411 --> 01:20:08,220
difference and that you can,

2545
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:09,090
you know,

2546
01:20:09,090 --> 01:20:10,820
these guys that sandbag like that,

2547
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:11,671
that's very,

2548
01:20:11,671 --> 01:20:12,930
very common and,

2549
01:20:12,931 --> 01:20:13,740
and yeah,

2550
01:20:13,740 --> 01:20:17,100
and see they think that they're gaining
something because you know what I mean?

2551
01:20:17,110 --> 01:20:18,640
It's just want to fuck somebody.

2552
01:20:18,641 --> 01:20:18,800
Yeah,

2553
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:19,220
yeah,

2554
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:20,053
yeah.

2555
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:21,090
And so,

2556
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:22,630
but let me tell you something.

2557
01:20:23,730 --> 01:20:24,750
My kids,

2558
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:27,360
I mean like when,

2559
01:20:27,361 --> 01:20:28,750
when we first started fighting,

2560
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:30,810
they had bungled Trumpsters hi.

2561
01:20:32,490 --> 01:20:33,323
I,

2562
01:20:33,410 --> 01:20:34,950
I mean my kids had never seen bound.

2563
01:20:35,010 --> 01:20:36,390
I didn't see Bongo drums.

2564
01:20:36,391 --> 01:20:36,571
That,

2565
01:20:36,571 --> 01:20:37,404
what am I saying?

2566
01:20:39,060 --> 01:20:40,050
But they were this high,

2567
01:20:40,051 --> 01:20:41,790
they were bundle and
they were in the ring.

2568
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:44,020
They only came out when,

2569
01:20:44,030 --> 01:20:44,670
when we,

2570
01:20:44,670 --> 01:20:47,990
when we got ready to fight and the
playing of bangles and you know,

2571
01:20:48,210 --> 01:20:48,991
great music.

2572
01:20:48,991 --> 01:20:50,070
I mean really it was,

2573
01:20:50,130 --> 01:20:50,760
you know,

2574
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:51,690
but you know what,

2575
01:20:52,530 --> 01:20:57,530
when you're hearing that bungle music
and you're in the ring and you're talking

2576
01:20:58,021 --> 01:21:01,520
to the kid in the corner and they're
outside now with the bangles and they're

2577
01:21:01,521 --> 01:21:02,990
playing the bongos and you're talking,

2578
01:21:04,290 --> 01:21:05,280
that's an atmosphere.

2579
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:05,940
Yeah.

2580
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:06,773
That's different.

2581
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:07,750
That's real experience.

2582
01:21:07,751 --> 01:21:08,790
That's experience.

2583
01:21:08,910 --> 01:21:10,320
That's life experience.

2584
01:21:10,321 --> 01:21:10,740
Yeah.

2585
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:11,440
You know what I mean?

2586
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:12,000
Yeah.

2587
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:12,660
Yeah.

2588
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:14,100
That's not taught in the classroom.

2589
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:15,160
And,

2590
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:19,640
and my kids have to six years of that
because that's about how long we did know

2591
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:21,840
I was up to seven years
train of photos for cost.

2592
01:21:21,841 --> 01:21:22,674
So,

2593
01:21:22,980 --> 01:21:23,813
um,

2594
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:25,411
I'm telling you,

2595
01:21:25,411 --> 01:21:26,520
my kids grew up,

2596
01:21:26,610 --> 01:21:27,211
they go to,

2597
01:21:27,211 --> 01:21:30,780
they will go on to be pros and did
they go on to be Olympic chair now?

2598
01:21:31,290 --> 01:21:36,290
But they took that and they used it
to be better at what they did into,

2599
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:42,060
to have the confidence to do things they
might not have had the confidence to do

2600
01:21:42,780 --> 01:21:43,920
without that experience.

2601
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:45,750
I got a couple of them
that have state troopers.

2602
01:21:45,751 --> 01:21:48,270
I got a couple of them that
are teachers in high school.

2603
01:21:48,271 --> 01:21:48,960
I got to cook,

2604
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:49,261
you know,

2605
01:21:49,261 --> 01:21:50,520
all different things.

2606
01:21:51,090 --> 01:21:52,800
Who coupled of one per college that,

2607
01:21:52,801 --> 01:21:54,600
that the nobody in their,

2608
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:59,110
in their history of their family
ever went beyond high school and,

2609
01:21:59,210 --> 01:22:01,850
but they went to college and
they were kind of told them,

2610
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:03,640
you're never going to go to college.

2611
01:22:03,690 --> 01:22:05,670
They went to college and I,

2612
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:07,770
I would like to believe it
had something to do with that,

2613
01:22:08,310 --> 01:22:09,143
you know,

2614
01:22:09,390 --> 01:22:10,223
and um,

2615
01:22:10,230 --> 01:22:12,320
I lot of people ask me,

2616
01:22:12,321 --> 01:22:12,391
you,

2617
01:22:12,391 --> 01:22:14,790
whom was you greatly because
I had Tyson to there,

2618
01:22:14,791 --> 01:22:15,061
you know,

2619
01:22:15,061 --> 01:22:15,360
he was,

2620
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:16,193
he became one of them.

2621
01:22:18,180 --> 01:22:19,013
And um,

2622
01:22:19,710 --> 01:22:22,260
I remember it was funny because
when I would put it down,

2623
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:22,981
like I said,

2624
01:22:22,981 --> 01:22:24,270
everyone lied about the experience,

2625
01:22:24,271 --> 01:22:25,240
but you know,

2626
01:22:25,590 --> 01:22:26,760
they lied about everything.

2627
01:22:26,761 --> 01:22:28,020
But I would put down,

2628
01:22:28,021 --> 01:22:28,260
uh,

2629
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:28,651
you know,

2630
01:22:28,651 --> 01:22:28,880
the,

2631
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:30,390
the age and everything else,

2632
01:22:30,391 --> 01:22:31,950
all the stuff for what it was worth,

2633
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:36,390
you had to have something
to try to believe in if I
didn't have to figure it out

2634
01:22:36,391 --> 01:22:37,224
from there.

2635
01:22:37,710 --> 01:22:39,140
So Tyson,

2636
01:22:39,150 --> 01:22:39,931
when I first had him,

2637
01:22:39,931 --> 01:22:41,490
he was 190 pounds,

2638
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:42,081
not a bum.

2639
01:22:42,081 --> 01:22:43,530
Also 12 years old.

2640
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:43,831
Okay.

2641
01:22:43,831 --> 01:22:44,664
That's what it was.

2642
01:22:44,790 --> 01:22:45,900
But that's what he was,

2643
01:22:45,901 --> 01:22:46,201
I mean,

2644
01:22:46,201 --> 01:22:47,360
that's what God made it.

2645
01:22:47,690 --> 01:22:48,440
So,

2646
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:50,490
so I go down and I put the first fight.

2647
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:51,710
Nobody seen Tyson.

2648
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:53,130
Nobody's ever seen data,

2649
01:22:53,490 --> 01:22:55,620
but 12 years old or zero phase.

2650
01:22:56,890 --> 01:22:57,290
Okay.

2651
01:22:57,290 --> 01:22:58,123
Hello

2652
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:01,033
Daddy.

2653
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:02,790
Now you go too far.

2654
01:23:03,210 --> 01:23:04,290
You like more than us.

2655
01:23:09,260 --> 01:23:10,093
Huh?

2656
01:23:12,630 --> 01:23:13,321
You don't know.

2657
01:23:13,321 --> 01:23:14,610
You learn a lot from us.

2658
01:23:16,650 --> 01:23:16,950
Okay.

2659
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:17,360
Is it,

2660
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:18,300
cause that's a compliment.

2661
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:19,521
I said,

2662
01:23:19,521 --> 01:23:20,450
I think for the Nelson,

2663
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:21,241
that's a compliment.

2664
01:23:21,241 --> 01:23:21,541
I mean,

2665
01:23:21,541 --> 01:23:23,070
I'd take a day because it is right,

2666
01:23:23,190 --> 01:23:23,970
right.

2667
01:23:23,970 --> 01:23:24,540
I'm not lying.

2668
01:23:24,540 --> 01:23:25,510
12 years old,

2669
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:26,730
190 pounds.

2670
01:23:26,970 --> 01:23:27,451
Please,

2671
01:23:27,451 --> 01:23:27,871
please,

2672
01:23:27,871 --> 01:23:28,704
please.

2673
01:23:29,590 --> 01:23:30,070
Now.

2674
01:23:30,070 --> 01:23:31,200
So I'm not learning.

2675
01:23:31,260 --> 01:23:31,980
Okay.

2676
01:23:31,980 --> 01:23:33,000
He's 12 years old.

2677
01:23:33,090 --> 01:23:34,470
It's going to be 13 soon,

2678
01:23:34,740 --> 01:23:35,820
but he's technically,

2679
01:23:35,821 --> 01:23:36,690
he's 12 years old.

2680
01:23:36,691 --> 01:23:37,524
Okay.

2681
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:38,251
Oh,

2682
01:23:38,251 --> 01:23:39,084
come on.

2683
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:39,811
I said,

2684
01:23:39,811 --> 01:23:40,110
all right,

2685
01:23:40,110 --> 01:23:40,990
I'll make you feel bad.

2686
01:23:40,991 --> 01:23:42,360
I put down 17 thank you.

2687
01:23:42,390 --> 01:23:43,260
Now you tell the truth.

2688
01:23:43,420 --> 01:23:44,470
Jay's not 17,

2689
01:23:49,740 --> 01:23:50,660
but I knew what I have.

2690
01:23:50,670 --> 01:23:50,941
I know.

2691
01:23:50,941 --> 01:23:51,570
Like I said,

2692
01:23:51,570 --> 01:23:52,403
I knew what I had.

2693
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:53,850
So I bought a 17 year old.

2694
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:55,501
I wasn't going to fight.

2695
01:23:55,501 --> 01:23:57,120
No 12 year old that was going to happen.

2696
01:23:57,300 --> 01:23:57,930
Right.

2697
01:23:57,930 --> 01:23:59,340
And plus I get arrested for murder.

2698
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:00,540
So,

2699
01:24:00,540 --> 01:24:00,811
oh,

2700
01:24:00,811 --> 01:24:02,640
what was he like at 12 years old?

2701
01:24:02,641 --> 01:24:03,360
Physically,

2702
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:04,290
mentally weak.

2703
01:24:04,530 --> 01:24:05,610
But physically,

2704
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:08,040
what do I mean mentally weak,

2705
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:09,750
not weak for the average guy,

2706
01:24:09,751 --> 01:24:11,130
but before fighter,

2707
01:24:11,540 --> 01:24:12,373
um,

2708
01:24:13,950 --> 01:24:18,950
he's still have remanence
he still had residual

2709
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:22,680
stuff from his upbringing.

2710
01:24:22,890 --> 01:24:23,251
Listen,

2711
01:24:23,251 --> 01:24:24,520
you want to know the truth about the guy?

2712
01:24:24,521 --> 01:24:24,751
I mean,

2713
01:24:24,751 --> 01:24:24,990
you,

2714
01:24:24,990 --> 01:24:25,740
he oldest,

2715
01:24:25,740 --> 01:24:30,730
but he used to hide in between
abandoned building walls in Brownsville.

2716
01:24:30,731 --> 01:24:31,564
It was a rough place,

2717
01:24:31,590 --> 01:24:32,423
no doubt about it.

2718
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:33,780
Did have a fall or whatever,

2719
01:24:33,781 --> 01:24:35,010
the model of whatever.

2720
01:24:35,460 --> 01:24:36,293
And uh,

2721
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:37,193
he,

2722
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:41,880
he used to hide between
walls to not get picked on.

2723
01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:43,650
And I believe when you do that,

2724
01:24:44,070 --> 01:24:46,980
you never get outside of that
wall to a certain extent.

2725
01:24:47,220 --> 01:24:51,210
You're always hiding in a wall for the
rest of your life as this is my belief

2726
01:24:51,940 --> 01:24:52,800
that teddy,

2727
01:24:52,801 --> 01:24:53,611
what are you talking about?

2728
01:24:53,611 --> 01:24:54,600
It became heavyweight champ.

2729
01:24:54,601 --> 01:24:55,800
Some people think he's the greatest.

2730
01:24:55,801 --> 01:24:56,634
I'll bet.

2731
01:24:56,730 --> 01:24:57,563
No,

2732
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:03,120
I don't have his record in front of me
and this is going to blow some people

2733
01:25:03,121 --> 01:25:03,954
crazy,

2734
01:25:03,990 --> 01:25:05,010
but what are you going to do?

2735
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:07,553
I don't have his record.

2736
01:25:07,580 --> 01:25:11,390
Let's just say we're going to make an
arbitrary number because your man's going

2737
01:25:11,391 --> 01:25:12,180
to pull it up,

2738
01:25:12,180 --> 01:25:16,090
but let's just say it's
50 and six all right,

2739
01:25:16,130 --> 01:25:19,110
we'll we'll say five 15 five but whatever.

2740
01:25:20,610 --> 01:25:21,660
I think his record

2741
01:25:23,790 --> 01:25:24,481
is truly,

2742
01:25:24,481 --> 01:25:25,201
if you're going to be this,

2743
01:25:25,201 --> 01:25:26,940
and we're not truly in life with anything,

2744
01:25:26,970 --> 01:25:28,200
but if we're truly,

2745
01:25:28,201 --> 01:25:30,900
truly in an Absolut world,

2746
01:25:31,350 --> 01:25:32,310
which we don't live in,

2747
01:25:32,940 --> 01:25:37,830
but I would say he's all in five high now.

2748
01:25:37,850 --> 01:25:38,590
Everybody says,

2749
01:25:38,590 --> 01:25:40,500
everyone who's listening
to you think is just like,

2750
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:42,300
let me get with Teddy's drinking,

2751
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:44,570
like I don't see them drinking nothing,

2752
01:25:44,571 --> 01:25:46,290
but he probably had
some before he came in.

2753
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:48,833
To me,

2754
01:25:49,140 --> 01:25:53,610
a fight is not a fight into
this resistance to there's
something to overcome,

2755
01:25:54,630 --> 01:25:56,310
something to overcome.

2756
01:25:57,540 --> 01:25:57,961
Otherwise,

2757
01:25:57,961 --> 01:25:59,250
it's just an athletic venture.

2758
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:00,510
It's an exhibition.

2759
01:26:02,250 --> 01:26:03,320
I think life is that,

2760
01:26:04,310 --> 01:26:05,030
I think the,

2761
01:26:05,030 --> 01:26:08,300
you don't know of a lawyer is
a lawyer and to into the some,

2762
01:26:08,301 --> 01:26:09,340
the overcoming the courtroom.

2763
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:10,340
Something goes for,

2764
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:11,473
okay.

2765
01:26:11,630 --> 01:26:12,950
I know he's a lawyer.

2766
01:26:12,951 --> 01:26:13,251
I know.

2767
01:26:13,251 --> 01:26:13,830
He went to see,

2768
01:26:13,830 --> 01:26:14,510
I get it.

2769
01:26:14,510 --> 01:26:15,830
Nobody has to tell me that,

2770
01:26:16,130 --> 01:26:17,030
but he ain't a lawyer.

2771
01:26:17,690 --> 01:26:21,800
He Ain't dad until everything goes wrong.

2772
01:26:21,801 --> 01:26:24,730
The judge throws all this crap out and,

2773
01:26:24,950 --> 01:26:25,783
and he's,

2774
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:27,380
he is aft,

2775
01:26:27,620 --> 01:26:28,930
so to speak and,

2776
01:26:29,050 --> 01:26:31,130
and he figures and he's still handles it.

2777
01:26:31,670 --> 01:26:32,503
Then he's a lawyer.

2778
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:33,970
A doctor is not a doctor.

2779
01:26:33,971 --> 01:26:34,460
And two,

2780
01:26:34,460 --> 01:26:35,690
he opens up this kid,

2781
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:40,840
a kid just like he's got it home and
arteries are bleeding all over the place

2782
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:41,510
and,

2783
01:26:41,510 --> 01:26:42,200
and it,

2784
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:43,910
it's not in a textbook.

2785
01:26:44,180 --> 01:26:46,040
It's not in a brick and textbook.

2786
01:26:46,550 --> 01:26:47,390
And he got to do it.

2787
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:49,400
He got to figure it out and he got,

2788
01:26:49,401 --> 01:26:52,550
then he's a doctor that he's
a surgeon at that level.

2789
01:26:54,820 --> 01:26:55,653
You're not,

2790
01:26:57,610 --> 01:26:59,030
you are not in a fight.

2791
01:26:59,090 --> 01:26:59,410
I,

2792
01:26:59,410 --> 01:27:00,020
I,

2793
01:27:00,020 --> 01:27:00,380
look,

2794
01:27:00,380 --> 01:27:01,370
I admitted.

2795
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:02,840
I equate life to a fight.

2796
01:27:02,870 --> 01:27:03,703
I do.

2797
01:27:03,980 --> 01:27:05,330
You're not in a fight.

2798
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:10,730
And so there's pressure
resistance overcoming something.

2799
01:27:10,970 --> 01:27:12,590
Otherwise it shows an exhibition.

2800
01:27:13,370 --> 01:27:15,230
Tyson's talent was so great,

2801
01:27:15,470 --> 01:27:16,940
his physical ability,

2802
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:19,520
his talent was so overwhelming,

2803
01:27:19,730 --> 01:27:24,080
just like somebody
intellect to some bodies,

2804
01:27:24,081 --> 01:27:24,914
charisma,

2805
01:27:25,670 --> 01:27:30,230
whatever beauty until it
came to something else.

2806
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:35,500
But his talent was so superior that
the other stuff never got tested.

2807
01:27:35,810 --> 01:27:39,320
He was blown guys out and
he had never got tested.

2808
01:27:39,350 --> 01:27:41,540
If there was anything in the warehouse,

2809
01:27:41,570 --> 01:27:45,230
so to speak of is anything
inside you never knew.

2810
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:46,880
And then five times,

2811
01:27:46,881 --> 01:27:48,110
whatever the real record is,

2812
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:50,300
five times there was resistance.

2813
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:52,970
Five times it became a real fight.

2814
01:27:53,570 --> 01:27:54,440
Five Times.

2815
01:27:54,441 --> 01:27:59,441
There was something to overcome and he
fell in all five times who only in five

2816
01:28:00,221 --> 01:28:01,100
fights in his life.

2817
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:02,990
And he's all in five.

2818
01:28:03,710 --> 01:28:05,210
I'm sorry sal graves,

2819
01:28:05,211 --> 01:28:06,870
because we know my history with them.

2820
01:28:06,890 --> 01:28:07,723
Right.

2821
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:08,810
Am I,

2822
01:28:08,810 --> 01:28:09,643
am I,

2823
01:28:10,370 --> 01:28:11,980
am I capable of died?

2824
01:28:11,981 --> 01:28:12,711
Yam Newman.

2825
01:28:12,711 --> 01:28:13,460
Yeah.

2826
01:28:13,460 --> 01:28:15,020
But I can honestly tell you,

2827
01:28:16,470 --> 01:28:17,220
okay,

2828
01:28:17,220 --> 01:28:18,720
that I,

2829
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:20,640
I took,

2830
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:21,120
um,

2831
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:22,350
I try to be better than that,

2832
01:28:23,010 --> 01:28:23,310
that,

2833
01:28:23,310 --> 01:28:26,150
that I've called many fights
where the people in corner,

2834
01:28:26,151 --> 01:28:26,984
I couldn't stand him.

2835
01:28:27,210 --> 01:28:28,290
I had no respect for them.

2836
01:28:28,830 --> 01:28:29,341
But if they,

2837
01:28:29,341 --> 01:28:31,200
if they did a good job
in a corner to fight,

2838
01:28:31,201 --> 01:28:31,860
it did a job.

2839
01:28:31,860 --> 01:28:36,860
I talked to bat like they were Ray Arcel
like they were Angelo Dundee because

2840
01:28:38,161 --> 01:28:39,450
that's what it was supposed to be.

2841
01:28:39,810 --> 01:28:40,643
That's all.

2842
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:44,520
And it's selfish because
I told want I wanna have,

2843
01:28:44,550 --> 01:28:49,340
I wanna know and I want my kids to
know that I can be better than that.

2844
01:28:49,341 --> 01:28:49,830
That,

2845
01:28:49,830 --> 01:28:51,210
that it's,

2846
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:52,130
it's about right.

2847
01:28:53,390 --> 01:28:54,040
Okay.

2848
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:55,410
It's about the code of,

2849
01:28:55,411 --> 01:28:56,320
of the profession.

2850
01:28:56,321 --> 01:28:56,570
It's a,

2851
01:28:56,570 --> 01:28:57,401
it's about you.

2852
01:28:57,401 --> 01:28:57,881
It's about,

2853
01:28:57,881 --> 01:28:59,380
you believe in that.

2854
01:28:59,381 --> 01:29:01,190
Would you say is

2855
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:03,600
she'll be honest.

2856
01:29:03,601 --> 01:29:04,980
It should be what you believe.

2857
01:29:05,370 --> 01:29:06,890
It shouldn't be tainted or,

2858
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:07,551
or,

2859
01:29:07,551 --> 01:29:11,660
or influenced by lesser things that,

2860
01:29:11,670 --> 01:29:12,860
that it does represent you.

2861
01:29:12,890 --> 01:29:14,280
Does represent your family.

2862
01:29:14,281 --> 01:29:15,840
It does represent where you came from.

2863
01:29:16,290 --> 01:29:17,400
It does stay.

2864
01:29:17,910 --> 01:29:22,910
Do you know your blurted out for those
five minutes or maybe two hours on ESPN,

2865
01:29:23,610 --> 01:29:27,720
but it stays somewhat can go back to it.

2866
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:29,460
You could go back to it.

2867
01:29:30,060 --> 01:29:31,080
How do you feel about it?

2868
01:29:31,081 --> 01:29:31,681
It does mean,

2869
01:29:31,681 --> 01:29:33,290
so it really does it.

2870
01:29:33,990 --> 01:29:38,990
And so I'm only saying it because
I would say it about somebody else.

2871
01:29:41,070 --> 01:29:43,290
In a way that I calibrate things,

2872
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:48,300
the way that I evaluate things that I
don't think that you know crap about

2873
01:29:48,301 --> 01:29:50,520
somebody until they're tested.

2874
01:29:50,850 --> 01:29:52,200
You don't know the friend.

2875
01:29:52,530 --> 01:29:54,090
You don't know if they're good wife.

2876
01:29:54,450 --> 01:29:56,010
You don't know if the good girlfriend,

2877
01:29:56,670 --> 01:29:59,460
you don't know crap you think you do,

2878
01:30:00,030 --> 01:30:01,590
but until they really tested,

2879
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:03,480
you don't really know.

2880
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:05,190
And Tyson,

2881
01:30:05,191 --> 01:30:06,060
when he got tested,

2882
01:30:06,061 --> 01:30:07,200
when he had to overcome some,

2883
01:30:07,350 --> 01:30:08,960
when when he didn't run him over,

2884
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:09,281
like,

2885
01:30:09,281 --> 01:30:12,810
like one of those big monster trucks
running over a Volkswagen because he was a

2886
01:30:12,811 --> 01:30:14,250
monster truck for Volkswagens.

2887
01:30:14,251 --> 01:30:14,550
Yeah,

2888
01:30:14,550 --> 01:30:15,383
he was.

2889
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:15,760
Yeah,

2890
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:16,593
he was.

2891
01:30:16,830 --> 01:30:18,900
And was he wanted the
greatest punches or don't?

2892
01:30:18,930 --> 01:30:19,351
Yeah.

2893
01:30:19,351 --> 01:30:20,184
Yes.

2894
01:30:20,310 --> 01:30:23,370
Could he punched from either side of the
plate like Mickey Mann or the greatest

2895
01:30:23,371 --> 01:30:24,030
switch hitter?

2896
01:30:24,030 --> 01:30:24,900
Was He that in by,

2897
01:30:24,901 --> 01:30:25,734
yes.

2898
01:30:25,980 --> 01:30:27,120
Could he could punch evenly.

2899
01:30:27,121 --> 01:30:29,400
Great with either hand from either side.

2900
01:30:30,270 --> 01:30:31,500
Was he all those things?

2901
01:30:31,501 --> 01:30:32,100
Yes.

2902
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:34,680
Was he as great intimidators Sonny Liston?

2903
01:30:34,681 --> 01:30:35,514
Yes.

2904
01:30:36,930 --> 01:30:39,150
Was he a great finisher like Joe Louis?

2905
01:30:39,151 --> 01:30:39,960
To a certain extent,

2906
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:40,793
yes.

2907
01:30:42,780 --> 01:30:43,980
But it wasn't a great fighter

2908
01:30:46,210 --> 01:30:48,340
because great fighters won.

2909
01:30:48,550 --> 01:30:49,690
The fight came to them.

2910
01:30:51,340 --> 01:30:54,310
They found a way to do
what they had to do.

2911
01:30:55,880 --> 01:30:58,700
He found a way to disappear.

2912
01:30:59,150 --> 01:31:00,470
They found a way to show up.

2913
01:31:01,610 --> 01:31:01,851
Yeah,

2914
01:31:01,851 --> 01:31:02,684
show up.

2915
01:31:03,230 --> 01:31:07,850
He found the way to go
and not show up and look.

2916
01:31:07,851 --> 01:31:11,840
You could go talk to psychiatrists and
you could go to all the reasons why.

2917
01:31:13,130 --> 01:31:15,680
Hiding between a war when he was a kid.

2918
01:31:15,710 --> 01:31:16,460
Yeah,

2919
01:31:16,460 --> 01:31:17,300
that's part of it.

2920
01:31:18,050 --> 01:31:19,250
I'll tell you another part of it.

2921
01:31:20,780 --> 01:31:21,770
To be that,

2922
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:23,570
not to be the power puncher,

2923
01:31:23,810 --> 01:31:25,610
not to be the aggressor,

2924
01:31:25,910 --> 01:31:26,391
not to be.

2925
01:31:26,391 --> 01:31:27,470
Just those things.

2926
01:31:27,650 --> 01:31:29,960
To be the Titan,

2927
01:31:29,990 --> 01:31:31,040
to be the Viking,

2928
01:31:32,780 --> 01:31:33,860
to be the Samurai,

2929
01:31:34,100 --> 01:31:35,000
to be the warrior,

2930
01:31:35,480 --> 01:31:38,450
to be those things has to be inside you.

2931
01:31:39,100 --> 01:31:39,933
You have to believe it.

2932
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:41,310
It all.

2933
01:31:41,310 --> 01:31:42,950
A lot of times people will lie in life.

2934
01:31:43,170 --> 01:31:44,060
This is Fullerton plays.

2935
01:31:44,061 --> 01:31:44,894
You can't lie.

2936
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:46,410
Okay.

2937
01:31:46,410 --> 01:31:46,801
You know,

2938
01:31:46,801 --> 01:31:49,530
sometimes we'd say that the
ring is the Chamber of truth.

2939
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:49,801
You know,

2940
01:31:49,801 --> 01:31:50,940
it sounds good and all that,

2941
01:31:50,941 --> 01:31:52,740
but it is.

2942
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:57,210
It is because just like
in other places in life,

2943
01:31:57,211 --> 01:32:00,550
so when moment comes

2944
01:32:01,990 --> 01:32:03,640
for those kinds of serious things,

2945
01:32:05,350 --> 01:32:06,700
you have to feel like that.

2946
01:32:07,810 --> 01:32:09,310
You say that you're the conqueror,

2947
01:32:09,311 --> 01:32:10,550
you Alexander the great you,

2948
01:32:10,551 --> 01:32:11,321
all those things,

2949
01:32:11,321 --> 01:32:11,591
right.

2950
01:32:11,591 --> 01:32:11,951
Okay.

2951
01:32:11,951 --> 01:32:13,030
Words sounds great.

2952
01:32:13,540 --> 01:32:15,040
Makes good soundbites.

2953
01:32:15,700 --> 01:32:17,440
Probably bring more people to the TV,

2954
01:32:18,010 --> 01:32:21,820
but when the moment comes and you didn't
intimidate a guy that didn't work.

2955
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:22,900
Okay.

2956
01:32:22,900 --> 01:32:24,490
We all try it to a certain extent,

2957
01:32:24,491 --> 01:32:24,790
right?

2958
01:32:24,790 --> 01:32:25,181
Probably.

2959
01:32:25,181 --> 01:32:26,014
Yeah.

2960
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:30,550
I'm sure you've looked at guys certain
ways when you were younger and and you'd

2961
01:32:30,551 --> 01:32:34,510
purposely looked at them in
a way to invoke a certain

2962
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:37,360
kind of action,

2963
01:32:37,630 --> 01:32:39,730
a certain kind of result,

2964
01:32:40,180 --> 01:32:40,780
fund them.

2965
01:32:40,780 --> 01:32:41,081
Just,

2966
01:32:41,081 --> 01:32:45,030
just look at Adam and a real serious
way that you hope that it weakened them.

2967
01:32:45,430 --> 01:32:46,263
Yeah.

2968
01:32:46,430 --> 01:32:48,550
And but because I know your background,

2969
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:50,800
you were prepared to do
what came after that,

2970
01:32:51,610 --> 01:32:52,900
but some people aren't.

2971
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:55,000
Some people aren't.

2972
01:32:56,230 --> 01:32:58,090
And Tyson was in

2973
01:32:58,790 --> 01:32:59,780
as great as he was.

2974
01:32:59,781 --> 01:33:00,614
I just said it.

2975
01:33:00,650 --> 01:33:03,200
He's great guys that
hate me for this today,

2976
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:04,460
your hero or whatever,

2977
01:33:04,461 --> 01:33:05,390
your favorite guy,

2978
01:33:05,391 --> 01:33:06,680
when he's great,

2979
01:33:07,850 --> 01:33:08,690
just not great.

2980
01:33:08,691 --> 01:33:13,691
And in his area and
when that moment comes,

2981
01:33:16,210 --> 01:33:17,290
you have to,

2982
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:18,880
that's where the truth matters.

2983
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:22,900
You have to believe that you really,

2984
01:33:22,901 --> 01:33:23,734
that guy.

2985
01:33:24,310 --> 01:33:25,500
And if your guide that

2986
01:33:26,140 --> 01:33:26,591
he listened,

2987
01:33:26,591 --> 01:33:27,251
he was convicted.

2988
01:33:27,251 --> 01:33:29,470
So I think it's fair that rape somebody.

2989
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:30,040
Okay,

2990
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:30,581
now listen,

2991
01:33:30,581 --> 01:33:32,440
I wasn't in an AV Rome and I don't know,

2992
01:33:32,590 --> 01:33:35,140
a lot of people don't take
okay but he was convicted or,

2993
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:39,220
but I know enough people in the business
that there was a lot of other bad

2994
01:33:39,221 --> 01:33:43,210
things that he did that are
just not things that that
you would probably want to

2995
01:33:43,211 --> 01:33:44,950
hang around with somebody if you know,

2996
01:33:44,951 --> 01:33:48,820
if you're a halfway decent human
being that he did devil week things.

2997
01:33:48,821 --> 01:33:49,151
Okay.

2998
01:33:49,151 --> 01:33:49,451
Week.

2999
01:33:49,451 --> 01:33:49,681
Thanks.

3000
01:33:49,681 --> 01:33:53,410
So when you do read things and you know
you did though and I don't know what,

3001
01:33:53,590 --> 01:33:58,480
but I'm just saying you do week things
and you know they will week things and

3002
01:33:58,481 --> 01:34:00,190
now you got to do a strong thing.

3003
01:34:00,250 --> 01:34:04,090
How do you become strong when you know
that you did those weak things and you

3004
01:34:04,091 --> 01:34:05,830
know that's really you and you got a guy,

3005
01:34:05,831 --> 01:34:07,300
a course way from your name,

3006
01:34:07,301 --> 01:34:11,110
Nevada Holyfield that doesn't give
a shit about how hard you punch.

3007
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:13,700
Does it give a crap about
what a finisher yard does?

3008
01:34:13,730 --> 01:34:16,600
It give a crap about how fair is
you put your punches together.

3009
01:34:16,780 --> 01:34:17,920
He wants to find,

3010
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:22,240
you're going to have to make him a
believer by doing it and doing it in a

3011
01:34:22,241 --> 01:34:25,840
difficult place because he's gonna make
it difficult because he ain't got to

3012
01:34:25,841 --> 01:34:26,680
cooperate.

3013
01:34:30,100 --> 01:34:31,270
When that happens,

3014
01:34:32,380 --> 01:34:34,090
you got to feel like that person.

3015
01:34:35,380 --> 01:34:37,180
And when you don't feel like that person,

3016
01:34:39,390 --> 01:34:40,223
you got a problem.

3017
01:34:42,490 --> 01:34:45,510
And as what happened wasn't
a matter when he bit his ear,

3018
01:34:46,110 --> 01:34:48,930
it was a matter that he was hungry and
he was a savage and he was from the

3019
01:34:48,931 --> 01:34:50,220
should stop the crap.

3020
01:34:51,910 --> 01:34:52,920
It was a way to get out

3021
01:34:55,020 --> 01:34:56,490
cause he knew he wasn't that guy.

3022
01:34:57,240 --> 01:34:57,981
And when you're not,

3023
01:34:57,981 --> 01:34:58,641
that guy goes,

3024
01:34:58,641 --> 01:35:00,080
what do you have a great talent off?

3025
01:35:00,710 --> 01:35:05,630
Recognize when somebody is
there as your greatest talent,

3026
01:35:06,530 --> 01:35:08,390
he can recognize when somebody is,

3027
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:14,090
and he recognized that Evander Holyfield
was and I was his way to get out

3028
01:35:16,840 --> 01:35:17,680
and he did.

3029
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:19,300
So that's why again,

3030
01:35:19,301 --> 01:35:20,320
it's not sour grapes.

3031
01:35:20,321 --> 01:35:22,360
It's really not because
I'm more selfish than that.

3032
01:35:22,660 --> 01:35:23,950
I really do care about

3033
01:35:25,570 --> 01:35:28,900
what well my reputation
is and whether or not,

3034
01:35:28,940 --> 01:35:29,650
uh,

3035
01:35:29,650 --> 01:35:31,020
I've been honest about things.

3036
01:35:31,021 --> 01:35:31,854
I say,

3037
01:35:31,900 --> 01:35:33,700
it doesn't mean I'm right per means.

3038
01:35:33,701 --> 01:35:34,534
I believe it.

3039
01:35:34,930 --> 01:35:35,890
I do care about that.

3040
01:35:37,630 --> 01:35:38,463
I do.

3041
01:35:40,300 --> 01:35:45,070
And so it's not that it
doesn't mean I'm right,

3042
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:49,750
but it means I have a reason to
believe on right from the way of live,

3043
01:35:49,751 --> 01:35:50,590
from what I've seen,

3044
01:35:50,591 --> 01:35:53,140
what I've experienced in the business,

3045
01:35:53,770 --> 01:35:54,790
the human condition,

3046
01:35:57,540 --> 01:35:59,550
how strong it can be
and how we could can be.

3047
01:36:01,970 --> 01:36:02,803
And um,

3048
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:05,870
he was a stronger guys.

3049
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:06,681
Are you ever going to see,

3050
01:36:06,681 --> 01:36:10,130
but he was his week of person
as you ever going to find.

3051
01:36:13,380 --> 01:36:14,220
That's intense.

3052
01:36:14,610 --> 01:36:19,440
But I see what you're saying in terms
of you are judging it by the highest

3053
01:36:19,441 --> 01:36:20,430
standards possible.

3054
01:36:20,431 --> 01:36:24,090
You're judging it in
comparison to other champions.

3055
01:36:24,750 --> 01:36:25,381
You're judging it.

3056
01:36:25,381 --> 01:36:25,541
You,

3057
01:36:25,541 --> 01:36:25,721
you,

3058
01:36:25,721 --> 01:36:25,880
you,

3059
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:27,380
what else you got to
jump through with Joe,

3060
01:36:27,870 --> 01:36:28,703
of course.

3061
01:36:28,830 --> 01:36:29,160
Well,

3062
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:34,140
you look at guys who are known for
incredible heart and their ability to come

3063
01:36:34,141 --> 01:36:35,390
back like Diego corrals,

3064
01:36:36,650 --> 01:36:37,600
David Carlson,

3065
01:36:37,620 --> 01:36:41,040
some of those wars when
you would say could steal.

3066
01:36:41,100 --> 01:36:41,610
Yes.

3067
01:36:41,610 --> 01:36:43,200
That was one of the
greatest fights of all time.

3068
01:36:43,201 --> 01:36:44,190
The forest of credible,

3069
01:36:44,220 --> 01:36:45,930
greatest fight of all Micky ward.

3070
01:36:46,060 --> 01:36:46,460
Arturo.

3071
01:36:46,460 --> 01:36:46,770
Gary,

3072
01:36:46,770 --> 01:36:47,371
the first one,

3073
01:36:47,371 --> 01:36:47,700
right?

3074
01:36:47,700 --> 01:36:48,760
Not the second door.

3075
01:36:48,870 --> 01:36:49,471
The first,

3076
01:36:49,471 --> 01:36:50,220
the first.

3077
01:36:50,220 --> 01:36:51,053
Unbelievable.

3078
01:36:51,120 --> 01:36:51,953
Unbelievable.

3079
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:53,220
I mean,

3080
01:36:53,220 --> 01:36:53,430
no,

3081
01:36:53,430 --> 01:36:54,300
if you want to go back,

3082
01:36:54,301 --> 01:36:55,330
if you want to go back farther,

3083
01:36:55,370 --> 01:36:56,640
most a lot of people will know this,

3084
01:36:56,641 --> 01:37:00,000
but you should call him was involved
in a lot and unfortunately he paid the

3085
01:37:00,001 --> 01:37:00,600
price.

3086
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:00,990
Okay.

3087
01:37:00,990 --> 01:37:01,590
Yes.

3088
01:37:01,590 --> 01:37:03,180
But Bobby should call in in the 70s,

3089
01:37:03,181 --> 01:37:03,780
eighties.

3090
01:37:03,780 --> 01:37:06,030
He was involved in those
fights every other day.

3091
01:37:06,330 --> 01:37:06,691
You know,

3092
01:37:06,691 --> 01:37:07,321
I'm just kidding.

3093
01:37:07,321 --> 01:37:09,930
But he was invited to
many of those fights.

3094
01:37:09,931 --> 01:37:10,764
Yeah.

3095
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:14,700
And unfortunately you don't know about
Bobby should call and you talk to

3096
01:37:14,701 --> 01:37:15,534
somebody again,

3097
01:37:15,860 --> 01:37:16,890
like the baseball thing,

3098
01:37:17,220 --> 01:37:18,480
you talk about the average guy,

3099
01:37:18,630 --> 01:37:20,250
Bobby Chicago and who the hell's that?

3100
01:37:21,980 --> 01:37:26,090
Who the hell is that affords is a
guy that would know his name anymore.

3101
01:37:29,150 --> 01:37:30,340
But uh,

3102
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:32,340
he was a pretty special
guy and everything.

3103
01:37:32,450 --> 01:37:33,530
He was pretty damn tough.

3104
01:37:34,910 --> 01:37:35,900
Tougher than most people.

3105
01:37:37,750 --> 01:37:41,290
There's guys that unfortunately
relied on that toughness.

3106
01:37:41,291 --> 01:37:41,860
Right?

3107
01:37:41,860 --> 01:37:42,250
Yeah.

3108
01:37:42,250 --> 01:37:43,450
Like when you,

3109
01:37:43,451 --> 01:37:46,180
when it comes to guys
known for incredible Chins,

3110
01:37:46,660 --> 01:37:47,740
that can be a detriment.

3111
01:37:48,070 --> 01:37:48,820
Yes.

3112
01:37:48,820 --> 01:37:50,470
And it can be if that's all you have.

3113
01:37:50,860 --> 01:37:51,820
Do you think that's what you have?

3114
01:37:52,120 --> 01:37:55,000
Cause she used to put it this way cause
she used to that because he wanted me to

3115
01:37:55,140 --> 01:37:55,973
a great trainer.

3116
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:57,600
So cause she used to always be with me.

3117
01:37:57,601 --> 01:37:58,230
All the tools,

3118
01:37:58,230 --> 01:37:58,630
you know,

3119
01:37:58,630 --> 01:38:00,770
scientists and cuss would say day

3120
01:38:02,540 --> 01:38:04,050
got two tough guys.

3121
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:04,850
Okay.

3122
01:38:04,850 --> 01:38:05,683
Gotcha.

3123
01:38:08,090 --> 01:38:08,923
Now

3124
01:38:09,460 --> 01:38:10,293
well it's tough.

3125
01:38:11,490 --> 01:38:13,240
It's a prerequisite to be in a fighter.

3126
01:38:14,020 --> 01:38:14,920
You better be tough.

3127
01:38:15,070 --> 01:38:16,060
But one level.

3128
01:38:16,660 --> 01:38:19,240
So all levels the greys and I got you.

3129
01:38:19,810 --> 01:38:22,870
But how special is being tough?

3130
01:38:23,380 --> 01:38:25,120
Because if you're a fighter
you should be tough.

3131
01:38:25,150 --> 01:38:25,983
I gotcha.

3132
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:27,153
Homelessness.

3133
01:38:27,580 --> 01:38:29,230
So you've got two tough guys,

3134
01:38:30,910 --> 01:38:32,110
but one of them is smart.

3135
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:34,353
Taught,

3136
01:38:35,230 --> 01:38:36,063
developed.

3137
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:40,713
That's him.

3138
01:38:41,830 --> 01:38:43,090
He's tough one now.

3139
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:44,871
That's how he explained it.

3140
01:38:44,871 --> 01:38:46,120
Tougher because he's smart.

3141
01:38:46,140 --> 01:38:46,630
Yeah.

3142
01:38:46,630 --> 01:38:48,100
Tough and smart.

3143
01:38:48,101 --> 01:38:48,461
He,

3144
01:38:48,461 --> 01:38:49,570
he goes from here,

3145
01:38:50,380 --> 01:38:54,130
he's here because he's not just
dependent only on toughness.

3146
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:55,840
So He's tougher than this guy.

3147
01:38:55,940 --> 01:38:56,410
Right.

3148
01:38:56,410 --> 01:38:58,120
Cause he don't have to
depend on just that.

3149
01:38:58,660 --> 01:39:00,130
You might not even have to get to it.

3150
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:02,710
It's there as a reserve.

3151
01:39:03,850 --> 01:39:06,040
It's always there to call on like an army.

3152
01:39:06,041 --> 01:39:06,701
You call on,

3153
01:39:06,701 --> 01:39:07,210
you need it.

3154
01:39:07,210 --> 01:39:07,990
Right.

3155
01:39:07,990 --> 01:39:10,600
But he's not dependent just on that.

3156
01:39:10,660 --> 01:39:11,910
Isn't that the balance though,

3157
01:39:11,980 --> 01:39:13,240
is knowing that you have it.

3158
01:39:13,420 --> 01:39:14,050
Yeah.

3159
01:39:14,050 --> 01:39:15,270
Knowing that you have it.

3160
01:39:16,060 --> 01:39:16,601
There it is.

3161
01:39:16,601 --> 01:39:17,500
See what you just said.

3162
01:39:17,980 --> 01:39:19,490
You have to know that are it.

3163
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:21,370
Tyson didn't know he was it.

3164
01:39:22,180 --> 01:39:23,320
We ever admit that.

3165
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:25,440
He probably knocked me and say dessert,

3166
01:39:25,480 --> 01:39:25,901
whatever.

3167
01:39:25,901 --> 01:39:26,440
I don't,

3168
01:39:26,440 --> 01:39:27,370
it's okay.

3169
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:28,660
And so I get I,

3170
01:39:28,661 --> 01:39:29,494
it's okay.

3171
01:39:29,530 --> 01:39:32,710
Well there's certain people that you
can't question and Aranda Holyfield's one

3172
01:39:32,711 --> 01:39:33,280
of those people.

3173
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:37,240
That's why that fight was so
fascinating because it was Phil was,

3174
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:40,210
he is a 100% warrior.

3175
01:39:40,240 --> 01:39:41,260
Well he had to write nickname.

3176
01:39:41,590 --> 01:39:42,580
Most of them don't.

3177
01:39:43,060 --> 01:39:45,850
Most of them don't have to write
fight nickname and whatever they do.

3178
01:39:45,870 --> 01:39:46,210
Right.

3179
01:39:46,210 --> 01:39:46,840
But the real,

3180
01:39:46,840 --> 01:39:47,620
the real deal,

3181
01:39:47,620 --> 01:39:48,640
he was the real deal.

3182
01:39:49,030 --> 01:39:49,390
Yeah.

3183
01:39:49,390 --> 01:39:51,340
And why small heavyweights?

3184
01:39:51,341 --> 01:39:52,174
You want to know why?

3185
01:39:52,750 --> 01:39:53,980
I mean trace it back,

3186
01:39:53,981 --> 01:39:55,030
cause always told me this,

3187
01:39:55,031 --> 01:39:57,490
but I learned it innately on my own too.

3188
01:39:58,090 --> 01:39:59,800
But trace it back to the parents,

3189
01:39:59,801 --> 01:40:01,450
trace it back to the background traitor,

3190
01:40:01,970 --> 01:40:03,400
trace it back to all that stuff,

3191
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:04,900
trace it back.

3192
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:06,200
He did.

3193
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:07,510
He didn't live up to something.

3194
01:40:07,511 --> 01:40:08,590
He didn't face something.

3195
01:40:08,591 --> 01:40:09,101
He didn't do.

3196
01:40:09,101 --> 01:40:10,470
Whatever it was there was about,

3197
01:40:10,630 --> 01:40:14,850
he had a mother that he talked
about a few times and I,

3198
01:40:14,851 --> 01:40:15,441
I'm sorry,

3199
01:40:15,441 --> 01:40:15,911
event of,

3200
01:40:15,911 --> 01:40:17,410
I'm not saying exact but,

3201
01:40:17,530 --> 01:40:18,790
but it's,

3202
01:40:18,910 --> 01:40:19,743
it's there

3203
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:24,330
that and a great model obviously,

3204
01:40:24,870 --> 01:40:26,580
but she,

3205
01:40:26,690 --> 01:40:27,430
they had a,

3206
01:40:27,430 --> 01:40:29,020
the crop and Georgia tech,

3207
01:40:29,030 --> 01:40:29,850
it was Atlanta pub,

3208
01:40:29,850 --> 01:40:31,200
whatever suburb of Georgia

3209
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:33,301
and she,

3210
01:40:33,301 --> 01:40:36,750
you have definite age and on different
time down south and all that,

3211
01:40:37,620 --> 01:40:38,221
had a little,

3212
01:40:38,221 --> 01:40:42,390
I guess a little shack in the back
with a thing called twitches switch.

3213
01:40:42,391 --> 01:40:42,961
It switches.

3214
01:40:42,961 --> 01:40:43,794
I'm sorry,

3215
01:40:44,340 --> 01:40:45,173
I'm twitching

3216
01:40:48,810 --> 01:40:49,643
switches.

3217
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:52,133
And

3218
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:55,870
she basically had different size switches,

3219
01:40:55,900 --> 01:40:56,733
you know,

3220
01:40:56,830 --> 01:40:57,521
short ones,

3221
01:40:57,521 --> 01:40:58,091
long ones,

3222
01:40:58,091 --> 01:41:00,520
medium ones depending on the occasion.

3223
01:41:01,690 --> 01:41:05,830
And when he didn't live up to
what he had to tell the truth,

3224
01:41:05,910 --> 01:41:06,521
whatever,

3225
01:41:06,521 --> 01:41:07,390
be accountable.

3226
01:41:07,391 --> 01:41:08,224
Okay.

3227
01:41:09,940 --> 01:41:11,170
Face what he had to face,

3228
01:41:11,171 --> 01:41:12,004
whatever.

3229
01:41:12,490 --> 01:41:13,030
Um,

3230
01:41:13,030 --> 01:41:18,010
she had a switch for
him and you know what,

3231
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:20,593
it um,

3232
01:41:21,250 --> 01:41:24,280
informed him because he faced things.

3233
01:41:24,610 --> 01:41:27,310
Tyson Tyson on the other hand and listen,

3234
01:41:27,340 --> 01:41:28,300
did he asked for it?

3235
01:41:28,310 --> 01:41:29,143
No,

3236
01:41:29,530 --> 01:41:29,741
no,

3237
01:41:29,741 --> 01:41:30,521
he didn't ask for that.

3238
01:41:30,521 --> 01:41:31,210
Oh brilliant.

3239
01:41:31,210 --> 01:41:32,043
I get it.

3240
01:41:33,050 --> 01:41:35,950
But I know people have that upbringing
and they get to a point they can,

3241
01:41:37,210 --> 01:41:38,400
they can make a left turn instead.

3242
01:41:38,401 --> 01:41:38,711
All right.

3243
01:41:38,711 --> 01:41:40,950
Turn is your ability to make,

3244
01:41:41,020 --> 01:41:42,610
I think there was also the,

3245
01:41:42,611 --> 01:41:47,350
the overwhelming hype and celebrity
involved in Mike Tyson in his prime,

3246
01:41:47,351 --> 01:41:50,020
it was probably so difficult for
him to even understand himself.

3247
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:50,890
Yeah.

3248
01:41:50,890 --> 01:41:51,131
But,

3249
01:41:51,131 --> 01:41:52,570
but what he did understand,

3250
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:54,040
and I'm glad you said that

3251
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:57,720
right backwards,

3252
01:41:58,020 --> 01:42:00,870
what he did and what he did understand

3253
01:42:03,390 --> 01:42:05,970
it was there was a way out of van learn,

3254
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:06,860
there was no way out,

3255
01:42:08,340 --> 01:42:08,950
you know,

3256
01:42:08,950 --> 01:42:09,770
oppose away,

3257
01:42:09,770 --> 01:42:10,431
you know what I mean?

3258
01:42:10,431 --> 01:42:10,611
Right.

3259
01:42:10,611 --> 01:42:10,750
Yeah.

3260
01:42:10,750 --> 01:42:12,710
Like somebody would come and pay.

3261
01:42:13,020 --> 01:42:13,430
Yeah.

3262
01:42:13,430 --> 01:42:17,750
And he did a lot of things before he
became champion and somebody was always

3263
01:42:17,751 --> 01:42:19,910
there with a check or cash or whatever.

3264
01:42:20,240 --> 01:42:20,611
And,

3265
01:42:20,611 --> 01:42:22,550
and w would absolve them from,

3266
01:42:22,551 --> 01:42:23,150
it would,

3267
01:42:23,150 --> 01:42:24,620
would not have to face what he did.

3268
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:25,200
Right.

3269
01:42:25,200 --> 01:42:25,550
And,

3270
01:42:25,550 --> 01:42:25,880
and,

3271
01:42:25,880 --> 01:42:27,730
but there was a switch that a van,

3272
01:42:27,740 --> 01:42:30,380
the hat of face and that's what made him,

3273
01:42:30,590 --> 01:42:31,423
what made him,

3274
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:34,300
and that's what allowed
Tyson part of would move out.

3275
01:42:34,310 --> 01:42:35,030
Tyson,

3276
01:42:35,030 --> 01:42:35,900
you look,

3277
01:42:35,901 --> 01:42:37,700
you make your own choice
at a certain point life.

3278
01:42:37,850 --> 01:42:39,410
So there's not make too many excuses,

3279
01:42:39,411 --> 01:42:41,930
but it is part of it that,

3280
01:42:42,180 --> 01:42:47,180
that he was formed by what he was
allowed to do when he shouldn't have been

3281
01:42:47,931 --> 01:42:48,980
allowed to do those things.

3282
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:50,810
So that was one of the issues
that you had with costs,

3283
01:42:50,811 --> 01:42:51,140
right?

3284
01:42:51,140 --> 01:42:51,973
Yeah.

3285
01:42:52,820 --> 01:42:57,620
That you felt like costs was ignoring
his own principles and teaching because

3286
01:42:57,621 --> 01:42:58,880
this guy was so special.

3287
01:42:58,970 --> 01:42:59,300
Yeah.

3288
01:42:59,300 --> 01:43:03,200
And cause was getting older
and cost recognize you
didn't have much time left in

3289
01:43:03,201 --> 01:43:05,980
this guy had a legitimate shot at being
a world champion and for cause heavy

3290
01:43:05,990 --> 01:43:06,750
thing in his June.

3291
01:43:06,750 --> 01:43:09,680
Everything in the world of
boxing success and everything.

3292
01:43:09,681 --> 01:43:10,191
He was great.

3293
01:43:10,191 --> 01:43:14,300
He was special because his whole life he
didn't get married for a reason because

3294
01:43:14,301 --> 01:43:15,081
he was married to box.

3295
01:43:15,081 --> 01:43:16,970
And as he said that it wouldn't been fair.

3296
01:43:17,180 --> 01:43:17,391
I mean,

3297
01:43:17,391 --> 01:43:21,150
this was a different guy that
it was boxing his whole lot,

3298
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:22,033
everything.

3299
01:43:22,100 --> 01:43:26,780
Life was boxing and lessons
were connected to boxing,

3300
01:43:27,950 --> 01:43:29,480
everything and um,

3301
01:43:29,990 --> 01:43:31,460
principals boxing.

3302
01:43:32,750 --> 01:43:33,583
And uh,

3303
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:35,420
so there's,

3304
01:43:35,420 --> 01:43:35,660
uh,

3305
01:43:35,660 --> 01:43:36,493
you know,

3306
01:43:37,320 --> 01:43:39,050
there's a guy that his whole,

3307
01:43:39,330 --> 01:43:39,621
you know,

3308
01:43:39,621 --> 01:43:41,120
you use that word legacy,

3309
01:43:41,690 --> 01:43:45,380
but really his whole existence was boxing.

3310
01:43:45,410 --> 01:43:47,930
And for him it was heavyweight champion.

3311
01:43:47,931 --> 01:43:49,070
He had Floyd Patterson,

3312
01:43:49,430 --> 01:43:50,850
youngest heavyweight champ ever.

3313
01:43:50,930 --> 01:43:51,763
That was cost.

3314
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:52,753
That was cost.

3315
01:43:53,100 --> 01:43:54,500
It was about lightweights.

3316
01:43:54,501 --> 01:43:54,891
Lizard.

3317
01:43:54,891 --> 01:43:55,641
He had lightweights.

3318
01:43:55,641 --> 01:43:56,500
He had welterweights,

3319
01:43:56,510 --> 01:43:57,343
Jose Torres,

3320
01:43:57,500 --> 01:43:58,191
Jose toys,

3321
01:43:58,191 --> 01:43:59,240
light heavyweight champion.

3322
01:43:59,241 --> 01:44:00,080
Exactly right.

3323
01:44:00,081 --> 01:44:00,950
He had other guys too.

3324
01:44:01,190 --> 01:44:04,700
But it was the heavyweight champion of
the world because it was around where we

3325
01:44:04,701 --> 01:44:07,400
talked about before when
box was the biggest sport,

3326
01:44:07,401 --> 01:44:08,330
bigger than baseball.

3327
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:12,500
And it was the heavyweight champ of
the world was Babe Ruth [inaudible],

3328
01:44:12,510 --> 01:44:14,930
Seattle and that,

3329
01:44:14,990 --> 01:44:18,620
and you're going to say that
before you leave this earth,

3330
01:44:19,160 --> 01:44:23,720
that you have a chance to have another
heavyweight champ that might be the best,

3331
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:27,710
could be one of the best ever and
could break Patterson's record,

3332
01:44:27,711 --> 01:44:28,970
which was part of the plan,

3333
01:44:29,330 --> 01:44:31,280
part of the plan when costs was alive.

3334
01:44:31,490 --> 01:44:32,930
You're going to break Patterson's reg.

3335
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:33,793
He broke it.

3336
01:44:34,070 --> 01:44:35,930
He became the youngest
heavyweight champion.

3337
01:44:37,160 --> 01:44:40,430
And so when you float that out there,

3338
01:44:40,670 --> 01:44:41,503
if you will,

3339
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:43,280
and tempt the guy with that,

3340
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,500
even a great guy like costs,

3341
01:44:46,620 --> 01:44:48,980
some things are going to
be a push to the side.

3342
01:44:49,130 --> 01:44:49,820
And Ethan,

3343
01:44:49,820 --> 01:44:50,031
yeah,

3344
01:44:50,031 --> 01:44:50,690
compromised.

3345
01:44:50,690 --> 01:44:51,523
And he did.

3346
01:44:52,460 --> 01:44:55,880
Do you think if he didn't do that the
Tyson would have been a different person?

3347
01:44:58,040 --> 01:45:03,040
I'm going to use his words that
was told to me by a great promoter.

3348
01:45:03,390 --> 01:45:04,700
Mickey toppy passed away.

3349
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:10,280
It was close to Jim Jacobs who was close
to cause and he was up there sometimes

3350
01:45:10,281 --> 01:45:11,420
after I left and all that.

3351
01:45:11,630 --> 01:45:15,440
And Mickey wanted me to train all his
fighters and he was a great promoter.

3352
01:45:15,441 --> 01:45:16,274
Mickey,

3353
01:45:16,790 --> 01:45:17,720
he had great sayings.

3354
01:45:17,721 --> 01:45:18,710
He was a very witty guy,

3355
01:45:18,711 --> 01:45:20,000
but he was a sharp guy.

3356
01:45:20,420 --> 01:45:21,620
Boxing was his life too.

3357
01:45:22,370 --> 01:45:24,710
And he ran everything in
London with three partners.

3358
01:45:25,340 --> 01:45:27,980
One of them was Java sustain
who owned Wembley Stadium.

3359
01:45:27,981 --> 01:45:28,940
So they were powerful.

3360
01:45:29,450 --> 01:45:30,350
They ran everything.

3361
01:45:30,500 --> 01:45:34,700
They were the cartel in
London back in those days.

3362
01:45:36,050 --> 01:45:41,050
He told me that before Carlos died that
cause had said some nice things about

3363
01:45:44,091 --> 01:45:44,924
teddy atlas,

3364
01:45:46,850 --> 01:45:47,840
but he said,

3365
01:45:48,360 --> 01:45:48,860
and La's,

3366
01:45:48,860 --> 01:45:51,230
I know there's a danger
that this can be convenient.

3367
01:45:51,710 --> 01:45:52,351
You know what I mean?

3368
01:45:52,351 --> 01:45:53,540
Self serving crap.

3369
01:45:55,580 --> 01:45:57,260
Sometimes you got to trust whatever.

3370
01:45:58,580 --> 01:46:02,150
I was told by Mickey that he said that

3371
01:46:03,370 --> 01:46:03,930
yeah,

3372
01:46:03,930 --> 01:46:06,210
Teddy Atlas was right by the way,

3373
01:46:06,220 --> 01:46:11,220
was wrong was who's going to get in a
way of the possibility of making a great

3374
01:46:12,181 --> 01:46:13,014
fighter.

3375
01:46:14,310 --> 01:46:15,143
Okay.

3376
01:46:15,690 --> 01:46:16,523
Um,

3377
01:46:16,860 --> 01:46:20,940
if he did things his way as far as the
disciplining in the in or whatever,

3378
01:46:21,480 --> 01:46:21,950
um,

3379
01:46:21,950 --> 01:46:22,620
eve,

3380
01:46:22,620 --> 01:46:23,453
in other words,

3381
01:46:23,490 --> 01:46:25,110
whether he left it like that,

3382
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:26,273
so I don't know.

3383
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:31,400
So I know what I think it meant that
Thaisa wouldn't have been around if you

3384
01:46:31,621 --> 01:46:32,040
did,

3385
01:46:32,040 --> 01:46:33,630
if you discipline that
he would have laughed.

3386
01:46:33,631 --> 01:46:34,464
I don't know,

3387
01:46:34,550 --> 01:46:37,950
cause I don't know that he had those
options because he was a ward of the state

3388
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:38,731
and,

3389
01:46:38,731 --> 01:46:39,060
uh,

3390
01:46:39,060 --> 01:46:39,301
you know,

3391
01:46:39,301 --> 01:46:44,301
it was coming out of obviously a
criminal situation who's coming out of a

3392
01:46:44,580 --> 01:46:48,180
juvenile detention center
called Trion up outside of old,

3393
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:49,590
30 miles outside Albany.

3394
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:50,993
Um,

3395
01:46:51,330 --> 01:46:51,661
you know,

3396
01:46:51,661 --> 01:46:53,130
so I don't know that he had,

3397
01:46:53,270 --> 01:46:56,400
but basically that if
teddy did it his way,

3398
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:57,660
he was right.

3399
01:46:57,660 --> 01:47:00,930
But he was wrong because it would have
ruined the possibility of a great fighter

3400
01:47:01,680 --> 01:47:03,480
and I couldn't let that happen.

3401
01:47:04,020 --> 01:47:06,480
So I don't think that it's,

3402
01:47:07,020 --> 01:47:07,980
I dunno if it's true,

3403
01:47:07,981 --> 01:47:08,431
actually.

3404
01:47:08,431 --> 01:47:09,264
I don't know.

3405
01:47:09,390 --> 01:47:10,770
You know what I was about to say?

3406
01:47:11,010 --> 01:47:14,430
I don't think that's true
because of course it's me,

3407
01:47:14,780 --> 01:47:15,120
right?

3408
01:47:15,120 --> 01:47:16,620
I want to make myself feel good.

3409
01:47:17,430 --> 01:47:19,530
So I want to say you could
have the best of both worlds.

3410
01:47:19,531 --> 01:47:19,771
So good.

3411
01:47:19,771 --> 01:47:24,030
We had maybe a better person or
within the realm of a better person,

3412
01:47:24,031 --> 01:47:24,271
right?

3413
01:47:24,271 --> 01:47:24,811
Boundaries,

3414
01:47:24,811 --> 01:47:25,021
right.

3415
01:47:25,021 --> 01:47:25,920
There were no boundaries.

3416
01:47:26,160 --> 01:47:28,530
Maybe there would have those boundaries
would have made a difference.

3417
01:47:28,531 --> 01:47:29,160
Right.

3418
01:47:29,160 --> 01:47:30,540
And you still would have had the talent.

3419
01:47:30,570 --> 01:47:31,330
He was so absent.

3420
01:47:31,330 --> 01:47:34,560
The talent wasn't going to dissipate
because I have to discipline,

3421
01:47:34,850 --> 01:47:35,131
you know,

3422
01:47:35,131 --> 01:47:36,900
that you put on them as a human being.

3423
01:47:37,980 --> 01:47:39,030
That wasn't going to change.

3424
01:47:39,750 --> 01:47:41,240
But because,

3425
01:47:41,640 --> 01:47:42,720
because we're saying that,

3426
01:47:42,770 --> 01:47:43,603
uh,

3427
01:47:43,610 --> 01:47:44,460
it wasn't going to happen.

3428
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:45,960
Maybe you'll lose them.

3429
01:47:46,380 --> 01:47:48,990
Maybe it goes to someone else at a
certain point in his development.

3430
01:47:49,020 --> 01:47:49,831
Maybe that's what he meant.

3431
01:47:49,831 --> 01:47:52,410
I don't know what you had
that with Shannon kitchen.

3432
01:47:52,411 --> 01:47:53,244
Shannon Briggs.

3433
01:47:53,850 --> 01:47:54,151
Yeah.

3434
01:47:54,151 --> 01:47:54,721
Shannon brings,

3435
01:47:54,721 --> 01:47:56,130
came from Brownsville and he was,

3436
01:47:56,700 --> 01:47:57,780
I had him as a young,

3437
01:47:57,930 --> 01:47:58,763
you know,

3438
01:47:59,010 --> 01:47:59,960
developing program.

3439
01:47:59,970 --> 01:48:01,020
We got to a certain point.

3440
01:48:01,110 --> 01:48:05,070
But you also had that situation with him
where you felt like he wasn't 100% in,

3441
01:48:05,910 --> 01:48:08,460
he wasn't doing the things
you wanted him to do.

3442
01:48:08,940 --> 01:48:09,570
He was,

3443
01:48:09,570 --> 01:48:13,770
he was lacking in a certain amount of
discipline or he was distracted in a

3444
01:48:13,771 --> 01:48:17,160
certain amount of ways that bothered you
to the point where you didn't want to

3445
01:48:17,161 --> 01:48:17,994
work with them anymore.

3446
01:48:19,560 --> 01:48:20,371
It wasn't committed,

3447
01:48:20,371 --> 01:48:21,510
I didn't think completely.

3448
01:48:21,511 --> 01:48:21,990
But,

3449
01:48:21,990 --> 01:48:22,620
uh,

3450
01:48:22,620 --> 01:48:23,610
he was a smart kid.

3451
01:48:23,910 --> 01:48:24,750
Take your kid.

3452
01:48:25,380 --> 01:48:25,980
Talented,

3453
01:48:25,980 --> 01:48:26,581
talented,

3454
01:48:26,581 --> 01:48:27,414
very talented,

3455
01:48:27,750 --> 01:48:28,351
smart,

3456
01:48:28,351 --> 01:48:28,591
you know,

3457
01:48:28,591 --> 01:48:29,850
he knew how to market himself.

3458
01:48:29,851 --> 01:48:32,910
He had to dreadlocks and he
made them orange and you know,

3459
01:48:32,940 --> 01:48:37,940
nobody was doing that back then and he
could punch it was talented and he looked

3460
01:48:38,641 --> 01:48:38,851
good,

3461
01:48:38,851 --> 01:48:39,270
you know?

3462
01:48:39,270 --> 01:48:40,103
Yeah.

3463
01:48:40,690 --> 01:48:41,523
Um,

3464
01:48:43,850 --> 01:48:44,930
but it's real commitment.

3465
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:46,060
I didn't think because then,

3466
01:48:46,061 --> 01:48:48,770
and maybe in the two to his credit,

3467
01:48:48,920 --> 01:48:49,753
he had others,

3468
01:48:49,910 --> 01:48:51,530
he was smart and he
thought of other things,

3469
01:48:51,531 --> 01:48:52,364
but

3470
01:48:53,630 --> 01:48:55,220
he never really bought in.

3471
01:48:56,680 --> 01:49:00,200
That is the end all was boxing that,

3472
01:49:00,201 --> 01:49:00,800
that,

3473
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:02,600
that was the complete,

3474
01:49:02,810 --> 01:49:05,930
I don't want to use just as average,

3475
01:49:05,931 --> 01:49:08,000
same standard word.

3476
01:49:08,150 --> 01:49:08,983
Commitment,

3477
01:49:09,060 --> 01:49:09,560
right?

3478
01:49:09,560 --> 01:49:12,020
Like what the figures that
sometimes like commitment,

3479
01:49:12,200 --> 01:49:13,033
but

3480
01:49:14,630 --> 01:49:15,710
more than commitment.

3481
01:49:17,270 --> 01:49:20,930
He said all the right things because
they had investors and they had different

3482
01:49:20,931 --> 01:49:21,221
people.

3483
01:49:21,221 --> 01:49:22,160
It's their bad thing.

3484
01:49:22,161 --> 01:49:22,840
Everyone does.

3485
01:49:22,840 --> 01:49:23,390
They,

3486
01:49:23,390 --> 01:49:24,380
if you're talented enough,

3487
01:49:24,381 --> 01:49:25,850
you draw those kinds of things.

3488
01:49:26,060 --> 01:49:27,020
To his credit,

3489
01:49:28,100 --> 01:49:29,000
he deserved it.

3490
01:49:29,130 --> 01:49:29,400
He,

3491
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:34,190
he did something to bring
investors and people to back them,

3492
01:49:35,030 --> 01:49:37,850
but he got so used to saying
what they needed to hear

3493
01:49:39,370 --> 01:49:42,010
that he never knew what he needed to hear.

3494
01:49:42,011 --> 01:49:42,844
He never,

3495
01:49:42,970 --> 01:49:47,970
he and what he needed to hear and
believe was that I'm really going to do

3496
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:48,110
it.

3497
01:49:48,110 --> 01:49:52,720
He got so good at selling it that
he never got good at buying it.

3498
01:49:55,200 --> 01:49:55,420
He,

3499
01:49:55,420 --> 01:49:56,410
he never really,

3500
01:49:56,950 --> 01:50:00,550
he just thought that I
ride this train and to

3501
01:50:01,440 --> 01:50:02,273
hm.

3502
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:03,630
I write is trained to,

3503
01:50:03,631 --> 01:50:07,830
I fall off or toe comes off the
track or to comes to a stop,

3504
01:50:07,980 --> 01:50:09,420
but it is going to come to a stop.

3505
01:50:10,050 --> 01:50:11,940
And I'm not saying everyone
can have that confidence.

3506
01:50:11,941 --> 01:50:12,960
Everyone can have that belief.

3507
01:50:12,961 --> 01:50:13,890
I'm not saying that,

3508
01:50:14,100 --> 01:50:15,390
but you have to get it somewhere.

3509
01:50:15,480 --> 01:50:18,900
Sometime he didn't believe that
the train was really going on here.

3510
01:50:19,230 --> 01:50:22,980
He believed that it was just going to
go to a place where it was going to be

3511
01:50:22,981 --> 01:50:27,210
better than where he was and
that that he'll ride it as long,

3512
01:50:27,211 --> 01:50:27,600
but he,

3513
01:50:27,600 --> 01:50:30,070
he's not committed to staying on it.

3514
01:50:30,870 --> 01:50:31,703
When,

3515
01:50:31,890 --> 01:50:32,191
when,

3516
01:50:32,191 --> 01:50:32,910
uh,

3517
01:50:32,910 --> 01:50:34,740
when it turns come up and,

3518
01:50:34,920 --> 01:50:36,810
and it gets a little fast,

3519
01:50:37,120 --> 01:50:39,660
he doesn't believe that he's
really going to get there.

3520
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:41,640
He believes that we're not first turn,

3521
01:50:41,641 --> 01:50:42,391
second turn,

3522
01:50:42,391 --> 01:50:43,224
third turn,

3523
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:46,410
whatever on a rails coms
that that's going to be it,

3524
01:50:46,530 --> 01:50:47,280
but it's going to be,

3525
01:50:47,280 --> 01:50:50,430
it took a better place than he
was at it earned him some money.

3526
01:50:50,580 --> 01:50:52,410
It got him some things and,

3527
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:53,310
and it was good,

3528
01:50:53,400 --> 01:50:55,020
but he never really,

3529
01:50:55,280 --> 01:50:56,370
there's that word committed,

3530
01:50:56,520 --> 01:50:58,710
but he never really believed.

3531
01:50:59,430 --> 01:51:00,630
And a lot of people don't.

3532
01:51:00,631 --> 01:51:02,160
They find their way along the way,

3533
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:07,760
but he never believed that what he told
to people around them that he was going

3534
01:51:09,991 --> 01:51:10,824
to be,

3535
01:51:10,890 --> 01:51:15,030
he never believed that his
personality was too good.

3536
01:51:15,420 --> 01:51:17,070
His personality was too sharp.

3537
01:51:17,550 --> 01:51:18,240
He,

3538
01:51:18,240 --> 01:51:18,960
he,

3539
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:23,250
he could say all the right things and
became easier to say the right things tend

3540
01:51:23,251 --> 01:51:24,570
to believe the right thing.

3541
01:51:24,571 --> 01:51:25,404
Does that make sense?

3542
01:51:25,420 --> 01:51:26,320
It does make sense.

3543
01:51:26,380 --> 01:51:31,210
This uncompromising psychology of combat
sports is uncompromising philosophy.

3544
01:51:31,420 --> 01:51:34,420
Is this something that you got from
costs as is something that you inherently

3545
01:51:34,421 --> 01:51:38,920
understood from working closely with these
guys and taking them to these smokers

3546
01:51:38,921 --> 01:51:39,940
in the South Bronx?

3547
01:51:40,170 --> 01:51:41,200
Where does this come from?

3548
01:51:43,060 --> 01:51:44,530
Just raw honesty.

3549
01:51:44,620 --> 01:51:45,453
Seen it all.

3550
01:51:46,620 --> 01:51:47,020
Listen,

3551
01:51:47,020 --> 01:51:47,381
the calm,

3552
01:51:47,381 --> 01:51:48,214
the form,

3553
01:51:48,250 --> 01:51:48,581
again,

3554
01:51:48,581 --> 01:51:49,990
you don't want to be Corny,

3555
01:51:49,991 --> 01:51:52,210
but it comes from living a certain way.

3556
01:51:52,211 --> 01:51:56,650
Life was seeing things traveling
to thing as part of it definitely,

3557
01:51:56,830 --> 01:51:58,960
but the,

3558
01:51:59,830 --> 01:52:01,120
the articulation of it,

3559
01:52:02,970 --> 01:52:04,530
the blueprint or map of it,

3560
01:52:04,531 --> 01:52:05,390
the seeing of it,

3561
01:52:05,400 --> 01:52:09,060
the visualization of it
on paper comes from costs.

3562
01:52:10,170 --> 01:52:10,951
He was a genius.

3563
01:52:10,951 --> 01:52:12,060
He was devastated world.

3564
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:13,231
The,

3565
01:52:13,231 --> 01:52:14,310
the theory of it,

3566
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:15,420
that's the better way.

3567
01:52:16,470 --> 01:52:19,560
The theory of it comes
from costs to living.

3568
01:52:19,561 --> 01:52:21,180
The doing of it comes from my father.

3569
01:52:22,440 --> 01:52:26,610
I had a father that most parks
and people don't come from,

3570
01:52:26,640 --> 01:52:28,160
although polarity,

3571
01:52:28,230 --> 01:52:29,190
great Mexican fighter,

3572
01:52:29,191 --> 01:52:31,920
but he came from something
like Davis who's,

3573
01:52:32,190 --> 01:52:33,540
he wanted to be a lawyer actually.

3574
01:52:33,541 --> 01:52:34,081
But anyway,

3575
01:52:34,081 --> 01:52:34,980
and you'd think Mexico,

3576
01:52:34,981 --> 01:52:36,240
you'd think why he came from the,

3577
01:52:36,570 --> 01:52:36,841
you know,

3578
01:52:36,841 --> 01:52:37,110
the,

3579
01:52:37,110 --> 01:52:37,860
the,

3580
01:52:37,860 --> 01:52:39,300
the dirt floors and stuff,

3581
01:52:39,301 --> 01:52:41,250
which a lot of guys
come from and you know,

3582
01:52:41,251 --> 01:52:43,560
they pull themselves out
and that's part of the,

3583
01:52:43,650 --> 01:52:45,000
obviously the motivation.

3584
01:52:45,380 --> 01:52:46,213
But

3585
01:52:49,520 --> 01:52:50,810
my father was a doctor,

3586
01:52:51,680 --> 01:52:52,850
it was a GP practice,

3587
01:52:52,851 --> 01:52:57,430
55 years stand out in New York
again from the Bronx Santa.

3588
01:52:59,460 --> 01:53:00,800
He found the two hospitals.

3589
01:53:02,150 --> 01:53:03,980
He built a house for 22 beds in,

3590
01:53:03,981 --> 01:53:05,270
it was called sunny side some,

3591
01:53:05,271 --> 01:53:07,880
I don't know if that stuff even
existed in Google back then,

3592
01:53:07,881 --> 01:53:08,720
but anyway,

3593
01:53:08,721 --> 01:53:12,890
with Sunnyside hospital
and he built it so that

3594
01:53:14,990 --> 01:53:15,890
all people,

3595
01:53:16,430 --> 01:53:17,040
I listen,

3596
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:17,801
whether he builds a,

3597
01:53:17,801 --> 01:53:18,890
so poor people,

3598
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:19,781
he was,

3599
01:53:19,781 --> 01:53:21,080
he grew up very poor.

3600
01:53:22,610 --> 01:53:23,420
He,

3601
01:53:23,420 --> 01:53:24,253
he just,

3602
01:53:24,320 --> 01:53:25,860
he was an that kind of allow his,

3603
01:53:25,861 --> 01:53:27,230
because he just,

3604
01:53:28,250 --> 01:53:33,250
he built his hospital so that the less
of people with less could get hospital

3605
01:53:36,141 --> 01:53:38,660
care because back in those
days there were no h or moles.

3606
01:53:38,661 --> 01:53:39,780
There was no Obamacare.

3607
01:53:39,830 --> 01:53:40,663
There was no,

3608
01:53:40,760 --> 01:53:41,001
you know,

3609
01:53:41,001 --> 01:53:41,870
whether you think it's good,

3610
01:53:41,871 --> 01:53:42,381
it's bad,

3611
01:53:42,381 --> 01:53:42,621
it's there,

3612
01:53:42,621 --> 01:53:43,281
it doesn't matter.

3613
01:53:43,281 --> 01:53:44,150
There was nothing.

3614
01:53:44,690 --> 01:53:45,800
He wound up in a clinic.

3615
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:46,780
Maybe you got all,

3616
01:53:46,850 --> 01:53:51,200
unless she had a doctor that
took care of me and he was,

3617
01:53:51,201 --> 01:53:52,160
and who are the doctors?

3618
01:53:52,161 --> 01:53:53,210
He wasn't the only one,

3619
01:53:54,320 --> 01:53:56,090
but he was the only one I knew.

3620
01:53:57,020 --> 01:54:02,020
And he founded Sunnyside hospital for
22 beds in her last about 25 years until

3621
01:54:03,290 --> 01:54:04,760
the Verrazano Bridge was built.

3622
01:54:05,870 --> 01:54:08,000
The city put the highway in there.

3623
01:54:08,460 --> 01:54:09,051
It changed,

3624
01:54:09,051 --> 01:54:09,590
sat down,

3625
01:54:09,590 --> 01:54:10,490
obviously fit,

3626
01:54:10,520 --> 01:54:13,490
connected pro-Clinton stand out and
you didn't have to take a ferry boat.

3627
01:54:14,270 --> 01:54:15,980
And He,

3628
01:54:15,981 --> 01:54:16,814
um,

3629
01:54:17,870 --> 01:54:22,870
the city border farmer and then he went
and found a doctor's hospital with 60

3630
01:54:23,511 --> 01:54:24,171
other doctors.

3631
01:54:24,171 --> 01:54:25,520
But he was the original founder,

3632
01:54:25,940 --> 01:54:27,890
him and a guy named doctor Tim Pawn Sr.

3633
01:54:28,700 --> 01:54:30,140
He founded doctors,

3634
01:54:30,141 --> 01:54:31,190
which was a big hospital.

3635
01:54:31,200 --> 01:54:31,581
Like I said,

3636
01:54:31,581 --> 01:54:32,181
30 years,

3637
01:54:32,181 --> 01:54:33,350
there was a big hospital,

3638
01:54:33,650 --> 01:54:38,650
but so he was a guy that he didn't waste
time telling me how to live and how all

3639
01:54:42,621 --> 01:54:43,454
that stuff.

3640
01:54:43,610 --> 01:54:45,910
The only thing I remember
was you say some do.

3641
01:54:45,911 --> 01:54:46,744
It

3642
01:54:48,110 --> 01:54:48,411
was,

3643
01:54:48,411 --> 01:54:49,244
I mean,

3644
01:54:49,520 --> 01:54:52,220
and then I watched him as a kid.

3645
01:54:52,221 --> 01:54:53,090
He was my hero.

3646
01:54:53,750 --> 01:54:54,980
I mean I liked Mickey Mann.

3647
01:54:54,981 --> 01:54:55,121
Oh.

3648
01:54:55,121 --> 01:54:56,500
And I liked Joe is,

3649
01:54:56,510 --> 01:54:56,841
you know,

3650
01:54:56,841 --> 01:55:00,200
all those things and
it's like any other kid.

3651
01:55:00,950 --> 01:55:02,200
But if I had a hero,

3652
01:55:02,210 --> 01:55:03,650
I didn't know what a hero was.

3653
01:55:03,860 --> 01:55:05,240
Am I going to make believe I knew,

3654
01:55:05,420 --> 01:55:07,490
but I know now what it's supposed to mean.

3655
01:55:07,491 --> 01:55:08,324
Right.

3656
01:55:08,510 --> 01:55:13,310
So he was my hero and I just,

3657
01:55:14,810 --> 01:55:15,770
I watched him,

3658
01:55:17,540 --> 01:55:17,901
you know,

3659
01:55:17,901 --> 01:55:21,620
when I went in his room one time,

3660
01:55:22,740 --> 01:55:24,620
when he graduated Nyu,

3661
01:55:24,621 --> 01:55:25,401
they didn't have money,

3662
01:55:25,401 --> 01:55:26,570
so he had to get scholarship.

3663
01:55:26,571 --> 01:55:27,860
He had to get help from different teams,

3664
01:55:28,010 --> 01:55:29,030
whatever they had to do.

3665
01:55:29,690 --> 01:55:31,160
But he got,

3666
01:55:31,370 --> 01:55:33,350
he went to Nyu medical school,

3667
01:55:33,380 --> 01:55:34,580
Nyu Undergrad,

3668
01:55:35,450 --> 01:55:36,830
and then he interned at Bellevue,

3669
01:55:36,831 --> 01:55:37,664
which that's,

3670
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:39,170
he wasn't a big talker,

3671
01:55:39,171 --> 01:55:40,004
but he told me,

3672
01:55:40,190 --> 01:55:42,530
he did tell me when
you graduated Bellevue,

3673
01:55:42,531 --> 01:55:43,530
you ready for anything?

3674
01:55:44,130 --> 01:55:45,540
So of later in my life,

3675
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:47,700
I took that as the South Bronx.

3676
01:55:48,570 --> 01:55:50,700
You graduated to South
Bronx to smoke smokers.

3677
01:55:50,701 --> 01:55:51,690
You were very funny thing.

3678
01:55:52,200 --> 01:55:54,120
You learned that you're
ready for anything.

3679
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:55,140
You learn how to match,

3680
01:55:55,141 --> 01:55:55,974
make you ready.

3681
01:55:56,100 --> 01:55:58,290
You'll learn how to be a trainee
that you're ready fairy thing.

3682
01:55:58,680 --> 01:55:59,760
So he,

3683
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:01,881
you know,

3684
01:56:01,881 --> 01:56:02,170
he,

3685
01:56:02,170 --> 01:56:03,003
he came,

3686
01:56:03,820 --> 01:56:04,653
he,

3687
01:56:04,670 --> 01:56:06,560
I did knock on his door when he was,

3688
01:56:06,980 --> 01:56:09,200
what it was in turning
of Bellevue of young guy.

3689
01:56:09,201 --> 01:56:10,034
You know,

3690
01:56:10,310 --> 01:56:15,170
apparently he saved some obese woman's
life that had a heart attack in a street.

3691
01:56:15,980 --> 01:56:16,761
He dragged,

3692
01:56:16,761 --> 01:56:17,810
dragged her off the street,

3693
01:56:17,811 --> 01:56:18,261
whatever,

3694
01:56:18,261 --> 01:56:18,830
the,

3695
01:56:18,830 --> 01:56:20,030
you never get the whole story,

3696
01:56:20,510 --> 01:56:23,780
but he saved a life and

3697
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:29,090
he developed a hernia at a
grown to a double hernia.

3698
01:56:29,091 --> 01:56:30,500
And my father was the kind of guy,

3699
01:56:30,620 --> 01:56:33,200
he didn't let anything
interfere with his patients,

3700
01:56:33,201 --> 01:56:34,034
his work,

3701
01:56:34,160 --> 01:56:35,390
he didn't take time to get it.

3702
01:56:35,540 --> 01:56:38,000
So he carried it for 30
years and he finally got it,

3703
01:56:38,210 --> 01:56:38,870
you know,

3704
01:56:38,870 --> 01:56:40,490
and so it become a double hernia.

3705
01:56:40,610 --> 01:56:41,720
I know hernia is now,

3706
01:56:41,721 --> 01:56:43,790
they do the Mesh and
they two ladies in there.

3707
01:56:43,910 --> 01:56:46,250
But in those days it was
a more serious thing.

3708
01:56:46,700 --> 01:56:48,110
He was evasive surgery.

3709
01:56:48,530 --> 01:56:49,363
Um,

3710
01:56:49,580 --> 01:56:50,450
it was different.

3711
01:56:51,440 --> 01:56:52,250
It was,

3712
01:56:52,250 --> 01:56:53,660
and it was painful apparently.

3713
01:56:55,130 --> 01:56:55,910
And,

3714
01:56:55,910 --> 01:56:56,743
uh,

3715
01:56:57,620 --> 01:56:59,510
I did knock on a door as a young kid,

3716
01:56:59,840 --> 01:57:00,673
you know,

3717
01:57:00,770 --> 01:57:01,510
very young,

3718
01:57:01,510 --> 01:57:02,420
but I still remember,

3719
01:57:03,200 --> 01:57:08,200
and there was a mirror here and he was
over there near his bed when the mirror

3720
01:57:08,871 --> 01:57:09,470
was here.

3721
01:57:09,470 --> 01:57:13,040
So I opened the door and in the
huck should have knocked obviously.

3722
01:57:13,460 --> 01:57:14,293
And um,

3723
01:57:14,300 --> 01:57:16,730
I saw he was bent over in pain.

3724
01:57:16,940 --> 01:57:17,211
I mean,

3725
01:57:17,211 --> 01:57:19,610
I could recognize and he
was wearing the thing.

3726
01:57:19,611 --> 01:57:20,520
I had no idea.

3727
01:57:20,521 --> 01:57:21,354
It was like,

3728
01:57:22,100 --> 01:57:23,840
I know what the figures that,

3729
01:57:24,440 --> 01:57:26,300
but it was probably not as,

3730
01:57:26,301 --> 01:57:29,930
you probably need you again to
give me the proper pronounciation.

3731
01:57:29,931 --> 01:57:30,764
Thank you for,

3732
01:57:30,860 --> 01:57:32,090
but it was trust.

3733
01:57:32,330 --> 01:57:34,830
I think it was rights suck as gutsy.

3734
01:57:34,910 --> 01:57:35,420
Yeah.

3735
01:57:35,420 --> 01:57:35,661
Yeah.

3736
01:57:35,661 --> 01:57:36,291
It was leather.

3737
01:57:36,291 --> 01:57:39,370
It was do things like this and you know,

3738
01:57:39,410 --> 01:57:40,520
I was like,

3739
01:57:41,360 --> 01:57:42,860
I don't know what the figures that,

3740
01:57:42,890 --> 01:57:43,723
you know,

3741
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:44,210
I could,

3742
01:57:44,210 --> 01:57:47,330
but I could see he was in pain and
he had this thing on and he got mad,

3743
01:57:48,920 --> 01:57:49,753
told me to get out.

3744
01:57:50,510 --> 01:57:50,751
And,

3745
01:57:50,751 --> 01:57:51,584
um,

3746
01:57:53,750 --> 01:57:55,160
for the rest of my young life,

3747
01:57:55,161 --> 01:57:56,420
I knew there was some Raul,

3748
01:57:56,780 --> 01:57:59,480
I knew he was in pain every
day and he never showed it.

3749
01:58:01,940 --> 01:58:03,290
He never uses juice.

3750
01:58:03,291 --> 01:58:04,160
He worked every day,

3751
01:58:04,161 --> 01:58:05,150
including Sunday,

3752
01:58:06,560 --> 01:58:07,381
has office hours,

3753
01:58:07,381 --> 01:58:09,830
word joke because of
it's said on the thing,

3754
01:58:10,130 --> 01:58:10,640
you know,

3755
01:58:10,640 --> 01:58:11,600
four 30,

3756
01:58:11,601 --> 01:58:16,220
he stayed till nine 30 because he didn't
leave till the last patient left and

3757
01:58:16,221 --> 01:58:17,390
most of them Warren panel.

3758
01:58:18,690 --> 01:58:19,190
Okay.

3759
01:58:19,190 --> 01:58:20,023
You know,

3760
01:58:20,260 --> 01:58:20,490
he,

3761
01:58:20,490 --> 01:58:22,730
he took the patients that
other doctors didn't take,

3762
01:58:22,910 --> 01:58:24,140
took all the Medicare,

3763
01:58:24,170 --> 01:58:24,651
Medicaid,

3764
01:58:24,651 --> 01:58:25,281
whatever it was,

3765
01:58:25,281 --> 01:58:27,920
whatever the right one
is basically welfare.

3766
01:58:28,250 --> 01:58:31,730
He took all of them and you know,

3767
01:58:32,270 --> 01:58:33,290
he made the,

3768
01:58:34,130 --> 01:58:35,960
he had the biggest practice on Stan arm,

3769
01:58:35,990 --> 01:58:37,310
maybe the biggest in New York.

3770
01:58:37,760 --> 01:58:38,593
So all the,

3771
01:58:38,630 --> 01:58:39,463
all the,

3772
01:58:40,400 --> 01:58:42,730
all the drug salesman,

3773
01:58:44,140 --> 01:58:44,610
they,

3774
01:58:44,610 --> 01:58:46,750
they all migrated to his place.

3775
01:58:46,990 --> 01:58:51,130
You want to get his account Dot
Dallas to sell the new stuff,

3776
01:58:51,131 --> 01:58:51,941
to sell the drugs,

3777
01:58:51,941 --> 01:58:52,810
to sell the pills.

3778
01:58:53,710 --> 01:58:56,170
And he used them.

3779
01:58:56,590 --> 01:58:57,640
He didn't hide it,

3780
01:58:58,810 --> 01:58:59,643
but he made them,

3781
01:59:00,400 --> 01:59:03,760
he made them give them
huge amount of samples.

3782
01:59:03,820 --> 01:59:04,653
You know why?

3783
01:59:05,050 --> 01:59:08,290
Because his patients couldn't
afford to fill the prescriptions.

3784
01:59:08,470 --> 01:59:10,300
So we would give him the free samples.

3785
01:59:12,470 --> 01:59:14,400
I used to always wonder
what the freak all,

3786
01:59:14,401 --> 01:59:14,731
he said,

3787
01:59:14,731 --> 01:59:16,400
I know how to open up a closet.

3788
01:59:16,401 --> 01:59:17,990
There was like things falling on you,

3789
01:59:17,991 --> 01:59:18,560
you know,

3790
01:59:18,560 --> 01:59:21,510
like pills and stuff as
like what is hot and,

3791
01:59:21,920 --> 01:59:24,920
but it was so he could give it to them.

3792
01:59:25,070 --> 01:59:27,290
So they didn't have to fill a
prescription because they didn't.

3793
01:59:27,320 --> 01:59:27,770
There was,

3794
01:59:27,770 --> 01:59:28,131
again,

3795
01:59:28,131 --> 01:59:31,490
there was none of those things that
pay for your prescriptions that they do

3796
01:59:31,491 --> 01:59:32,324
today.

3797
01:59:32,840 --> 01:59:33,890
And they couldn't afford it.

3798
01:59:34,190 --> 01:59:35,600
They couldn't afford to go to him,

3799
01:59:36,500 --> 01:59:37,820
but he charged them $3,

3800
01:59:37,850 --> 01:59:38,720
$5,

3801
01:59:39,830 --> 01:59:40,460
whatever,

3802
01:59:40,460 --> 01:59:42,200
whatever it was that they could afford.

3803
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:43,510
Yeah.

3804
01:59:43,510 --> 01:59:44,830
And you know,

3805
01:59:44,831 --> 01:59:45,670
he made money.

3806
01:59:45,970 --> 01:59:46,301
I mean,

3807
01:59:46,301 --> 01:59:47,200
he was a doctor,

3808
01:59:47,500 --> 01:59:49,760
but he didn't make the money
that other doctors will make it.

3809
01:59:50,710 --> 01:59:52,120
But he was a real,

3810
01:59:52,121 --> 01:59:54,190
docked a right for me at least.

3811
01:59:54,700 --> 01:59:55,533
And,

3812
01:59:55,900 --> 01:59:57,070
but more importantly,

3813
01:59:58,300 --> 01:59:59,470
he didn't talk about it.

3814
01:59:59,471 --> 02:00:00,304
He did it.

3815
02:00:01,120 --> 02:00:01,953
And he,

3816
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:03,460
every day he was in pain.

3817
02:00:03,850 --> 02:00:04,683
Later on,

3818
02:00:04,980 --> 02:00:05,560
oh,

3819
02:00:05,560 --> 02:00:06,400
I was a little older,

3820
02:00:06,401 --> 02:00:07,900
but I was still young teenager.

3821
02:00:08,200 --> 02:00:10,060
I saw him put a white
pill onto his tongue.

3822
02:00:10,180 --> 02:00:11,530
I didn't know what the freak that was.

3823
02:00:11,950 --> 02:00:15,570
I later on I found out it was
nitrile that has hardwoods,

3824
02:00:15,700 --> 02:00:16,660
puts skipped beats,

3825
02:00:17,470 --> 02:00:19,810
but he still didn't say a word.

3826
02:00:20,140 --> 02:00:22,360
Didn't talk about it in all.

3827
02:00:22,630 --> 02:00:24,970
If he didn't have his son
who thought it was his hero,

3828
02:00:24,971 --> 02:00:25,804
he,

3829
02:00:26,110 --> 02:00:28,540
I wouldn't have known because
I looked at everything he did

3830
02:00:30,040 --> 02:00:31,300
and you know,

3831
02:00:31,301 --> 02:00:32,134
he um,

3832
02:00:33,040 --> 02:00:34,240
he did house calls.

3833
02:00:35,060 --> 02:00:35,320
Yeah,

3834
02:00:35,320 --> 02:00:35,651
he did.

3835
02:00:35,651 --> 02:00:36,351
House caused,

3836
02:00:36,351 --> 02:00:37,510
who is 80 years old,

3837
02:00:38,230 --> 02:00:39,550
charging $5,

3838
02:00:39,820 --> 02:00:40,420
whatever.

3839
02:00:40,420 --> 02:00:41,253
Nothing.

3840
02:00:42,010 --> 02:00:44,860
He had patients that could
not get to an emergency role.

3841
02:00:45,340 --> 02:00:46,960
They didn't have the ability to get there.

3842
02:00:46,961 --> 02:00:47,890
They didn't have a car.

3843
02:00:48,490 --> 02:00:49,870
They wouldn't shape
where they couldn't get,

3844
02:00:49,871 --> 02:00:50,830
they couldn't take a bus,

3845
02:00:50,831 --> 02:00:51,664
whatever.

3846
02:00:51,940 --> 02:00:55,090
But so he did house calls
and a patients when he died,

3847
02:00:55,091 --> 02:00:55,924
they all said,

3848
02:00:56,020 --> 02:00:56,561
hey Lou,

3849
02:00:56,561 --> 02:00:58,630
you sometimes you have to
wait till one in the morning.

3850
02:00:58,631 --> 02:00:59,530
But he got there.

3851
02:01:00,940 --> 02:01:01,631
That was the thing.

3852
02:01:01,631 --> 02:01:02,530
He always got there.

3853
02:01:03,460 --> 02:01:04,300
He always delivered.

3854
02:01:05,650 --> 02:01:07,900
And with all those things that I knew was,

3855
02:01:07,990 --> 02:01:08,261
you know,

3856
02:01:08,261 --> 02:01:08,411
his,

3857
02:01:08,411 --> 02:01:09,244
his kid.

3858
02:01:10,040 --> 02:01:10,520
Yeah.

3859
02:01:10,520 --> 02:01:11,510
He never used it.

3860
02:01:11,511 --> 02:01:12,500
Made an excuse.

3861
02:01:14,210 --> 02:01:15,710
And he was a fighter,

3862
02:01:18,420 --> 02:01:18,751
you know,

3863
02:01:18,751 --> 02:01:18,961
in,

3864
02:01:18,961 --> 02:01:19,771
in their own way.

3865
02:01:19,771 --> 02:01:20,604
He was to,

3866
02:01:20,970 --> 02:01:21,803
you know,

3867
02:01:22,230 --> 02:01:26,130
he was the best fighter of his
soul and he didn't talk about it.

3868
02:01:26,131 --> 02:01:27,330
He didn't articulate it,

3869
02:01:28,170 --> 02:01:28,591
you know,

3870
02:01:28,591 --> 02:01:30,330
he didn't wax poetic about it,

3871
02:01:30,420 --> 02:01:32,250
like cause state and
cause it was a great man,

3872
02:01:33,720 --> 02:01:36,660
but he did it that he did
right in front of my face.

3873
02:01:38,280 --> 02:01:39,113
And uh,

3874
02:01:42,180 --> 02:01:43,170
and it stayed with me.

3875
02:01:44,510 --> 02:01:44,790
You know,

3876
02:01:44,790 --> 02:01:46,170
I didn't understand a lot of it too.

3877
02:01:46,171 --> 02:01:47,004
I got older

3878
02:01:48,540 --> 02:01:51,050
but then suddenly I understood all of it.

3879
02:01:52,730 --> 02:01:53,310
Yeah.

3880
02:01:53,310 --> 02:01:54,143
And um,

3881
02:01:54,780 --> 02:01:56,460
so if somebody says,

3882
02:01:56,461 --> 02:01:57,294
hey,

3883
02:01:58,680 --> 02:01:59,071
you know,

3884
02:01:59,071 --> 02:02:00,300
I can't do this because,

3885
02:02:00,301 --> 02:02:01,134
you know,

3886
02:02:01,290 --> 02:02:02,570
last night my girlfriend,

3887
02:02:02,580 --> 02:02:05,030
my wife yelled at me and
she caught me with a girl.

3888
02:02:05,090 --> 02:02:05,923
She did.

3889
02:02:05,970 --> 02:02:06,331
I mean,

3890
02:02:06,331 --> 02:02:07,164
I don't want to hear it.

3891
02:02:10,200 --> 02:02:11,033
I don't want to eat,

3892
02:02:12,060 --> 02:02:13,020
I don't want to hear it.

3893
02:02:14,640 --> 02:02:15,121
And listen,

3894
02:02:15,121 --> 02:02:16,170
it was of course to me too,

3895
02:02:16,171 --> 02:02:19,080
in some ways it's not perfect
because when my father died,

3896
02:02:19,410 --> 02:02:20,161
I went to the,

3897
02:02:20,161 --> 02:02:24,060
I went to the funeral and then I went
to the gym and I didn't tell nobody.

3898
02:02:24,570 --> 02:02:25,021
And listen,

3899
02:02:25,021 --> 02:02:25,854
I probably shouldn't.

3900
02:02:27,300 --> 02:02:31,320
A lot of people would probably say he
can't live your life to way by what people

3901
02:02:31,321 --> 02:02:31,561
say.

3902
02:02:31,561 --> 02:02:32,394
I get it,

3903
02:02:32,400 --> 02:02:34,050
but I'm just saying I'm aware of it.

3904
02:02:34,051 --> 02:02:34,860
All right.

3905
02:02:34,860 --> 02:02:36,720
A lot of people who say you
shouldn't have went to the gym.

3906
02:02:39,320 --> 02:02:40,190
My father,

3907
02:02:40,280 --> 02:02:41,150
we lost a kid.

3908
02:02:41,151 --> 02:02:45,080
He was five years old and I wasn't going
to say this because I don't know how

3909
02:02:45,081 --> 02:02:45,914
some people say,

3910
02:02:45,920 --> 02:02:47,240
but if it is,

3911
02:02:47,241 --> 02:02:47,631
it is.

3912
02:02:47,631 --> 02:02:48,464
Right.

3913
02:02:48,800 --> 02:02:50,810
So you could take it the
way you want to take it.

3914
02:02:51,560 --> 02:02:53,210
I know the kind of man he was,

3915
02:02:53,870 --> 02:02:54,703
but

3916
02:02:55,790 --> 02:02:57,050
you talked about commitment,

3917
02:02:57,051 --> 02:02:57,840
absolute limits.

3918
02:02:57,840 --> 02:02:59,120
You'd talked about certain things,

3919
02:02:59,121 --> 02:02:59,954
right?

3920
02:03:00,350 --> 02:03:02,540
Maybe just to explain some of it.

3921
02:03:03,050 --> 02:03:04,040
We had little Todd,

3922
02:03:04,041 --> 02:03:04,874
he was all product.

3923
02:03:05,410 --> 02:03:07,370
He was born with problems.

3924
02:03:07,400 --> 02:03:08,233
Who's retarded?

3925
02:03:08,420 --> 02:03:09,830
You don't use that word anymore.

3926
02:03:09,831 --> 02:03:11,900
But in those days it was
okay to use that word.

3927
02:03:11,901 --> 02:03:12,620
That's what he was.

3928
02:03:12,620 --> 02:03:13,453
Okay.

3929
02:03:13,490 --> 02:03:15,560
Now of course you say
that it was impaired,

3930
02:03:15,920 --> 02:03:16,910
mentally impaired,

3931
02:03:17,030 --> 02:03:17,863
whatever.

3932
02:03:17,930 --> 02:03:18,470
Okay.

3933
02:03:18,470 --> 02:03:19,460
He's a beautiful kid.

3934
02:03:19,490 --> 02:03:20,323
I remember him.

3935
02:03:22,250 --> 02:03:23,060
I was older,

3936
02:03:23,060 --> 02:03:23,893
I was the oldest.

3937
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:25,700
He was very loving.

3938
02:03:26,510 --> 02:03:28,940
I remember used to jump into
my arms when I come home.

3939
02:03:28,941 --> 02:03:33,320
So I know he was very trusting because
I would walk up the steps and he would

3940
02:03:33,321 --> 02:03:35,210
jump from the steps if
I didn't catch them,

3941
02:03:35,300 --> 02:03:36,440
obviously would have fell.

3942
02:03:36,650 --> 02:03:38,090
So it was part of his condition,

3943
02:03:38,091 --> 02:03:40,970
but it was part of his
lovingness and has his trust.

3944
02:03:43,500 --> 02:03:44,730
So when he was five years old,

3945
02:03:44,731 --> 02:03:45,690
he had to get surgery.

3946
02:03:45,691 --> 02:03:46,360
He had a problem,

3947
02:03:46,360 --> 02:03:47,010
was hot,

3948
02:03:47,010 --> 02:03:47,970
it was open heart surgery,

3949
02:03:47,971 --> 02:03:51,060
open heart surgery is all
different story back then.

3950
02:03:51,061 --> 02:03:51,894
Right.

3951
02:03:51,990 --> 02:03:53,580
And where did he get out of probation?

3952
02:03:53,581 --> 02:03:53,761
Yeah,

3953
02:03:53,761 --> 02:03:54,240
he did.

3954
02:03:54,240 --> 02:03:55,380
And my father's hospital,

3955
02:03:55,800 --> 02:03:57,450
but father did not perform the surgery.

3956
02:03:57,451 --> 02:03:59,550
Of course you're not going to do that.

3957
02:03:59,850 --> 02:04:00,683
But it was there.

3958
02:04:01,150 --> 02:04:02,430
There was a few surgeons,

3959
02:04:02,431 --> 02:04:03,360
it might've been five,

3960
02:04:03,361 --> 02:04:04,194
whatever it was.

3961
02:04:07,260 --> 02:04:08,093
And um,

3962
02:04:11,410 --> 02:04:12,760
my mother was the opposite of him.

3963
02:04:12,850 --> 02:04:15,220
My father was a Hungarian
Jewish background,

3964
02:04:15,610 --> 02:04:16,170
you know,

3965
02:04:16,170 --> 02:04:16,540
uh,

3966
02:04:16,540 --> 02:04:16,711
he,

3967
02:04:16,711 --> 02:04:17,620
he had no father.

3968
02:04:17,621 --> 02:04:18,460
He died young.

3969
02:04:18,760 --> 02:04:19,261
His mother,

3970
02:04:19,261 --> 02:04:20,200
they were very poor.

3971
02:04:20,680 --> 02:04:21,940
My mother grew up poor too.

3972
02:04:21,941 --> 02:04:22,240
Shoes,

3973
02:04:22,240 --> 02:04:22,930
Irish,

3974
02:04:22,930 --> 02:04:23,291
Irish,

3975
02:04:23,291 --> 02:04:24,124
Catholic,

3976
02:04:25,210 --> 02:04:26,050
different makes.

3977
02:04:26,410 --> 02:04:28,690
And my father didn't
have time for religion.

3978
02:04:28,720 --> 02:04:30,430
My time for that time for living.

3979
02:04:31,300 --> 02:04:32,980
And for healing people.

3980
02:04:33,670 --> 02:04:35,770
So he let us be brought up Catholic.

3981
02:04:35,850 --> 02:04:36,790
That was up to my mother

3982
02:04:38,310 --> 02:04:39,143
and uh,

3983
02:04:40,710 --> 02:04:41,543
so he,

3984
02:04:42,780 --> 02:04:43,170
okay,

3985
02:04:43,170 --> 02:04:43,530
eh,

3986
02:04:43,530 --> 02:04:44,281
they were different.

3987
02:04:44,281 --> 02:04:45,570
They would the opposites.

3988
02:04:45,720 --> 02:04:46,710
When mother was beautiful,

3989
02:04:46,711 --> 02:04:47,481
she was Ms. Dot.

3990
02:04:47,481 --> 02:04:48,900
Nowlin uh,

3991
02:04:49,010 --> 02:04:50,880
her mother didn't let her father died.

3992
02:04:51,300 --> 02:04:52,200
Also young,

3993
02:04:52,970 --> 02:04:53,803
uh,

3994
02:04:53,870 --> 02:04:57,880
her mother was a tough
Irish woman and she,

3995
02:04:57,990 --> 02:04:58,740
my grandma,

3996
02:04:58,740 --> 02:04:59,131
she,

3997
02:04:59,131 --> 02:05:02,040
she did not allow her from winning.

3998
02:05:02,041 --> 02:05:02,500
Ms. Dot.

3999
02:05:02,500 --> 02:05:05,220
Announce was supposed to go to
them obviously to Miss America.

4000
02:05:05,490 --> 02:05:06,330
She wouldn't let it go.

4001
02:05:06,850 --> 02:05:07,621
I say right out,

4002
02:05:07,621 --> 02:05:08,810
she thought that was for horse.

4003
02:05:09,490 --> 02:05:09,751
Like,

4004
02:05:09,751 --> 02:05:10,600
like you go do that.

4005
02:05:10,620 --> 02:05:10,891
You know,

4006
02:05:10,891 --> 02:05:11,701
even though she wanted,

4007
02:05:11,701 --> 02:05:12,031
she led,

4008
02:05:12,031 --> 02:05:12,864
that was cute,

4009
02:05:13,050 --> 02:05:14,520
but now you're going to go miss America,

4010
02:05:14,521 --> 02:05:15,000
you're going to go,

4011
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:15,690
no,

4012
02:05:15,690 --> 02:05:16,523
we're not.

4013
02:05:16,590 --> 02:05:17,011
She said,

4014
02:05:17,011 --> 02:05:17,131
no,

4015
02:05:17,131 --> 02:05:17,964
you're not doing it.

4016
02:05:18,210 --> 02:05:21,120
And she had a chance to go
and try out for the rock cats,

4017
02:05:21,121 --> 02:05:22,380
which most people are,

4018
02:05:22,381 --> 02:05:23,340
they know what they are,

4019
02:05:23,700 --> 02:05:24,740
the dance group and,

4020
02:05:24,760 --> 02:05:25,593
uh,

4021
02:05:25,920 --> 02:05:27,060
Radio City Music Hall.

4022
02:05:27,070 --> 02:05:29,310
Now that's for those people told them no.

4023
02:05:30,330 --> 02:05:35,330
So she was beautiful and she had
a great personality and she's,

4024
02:05:35,820 --> 02:05:37,560
she love social life.

4025
02:05:38,310 --> 02:05:42,540
And two is the antithesis of
my father and a lot of ways,

4026
02:05:42,541 --> 02:05:47,370
and I guess opposites attract and if
you want to make a movie out of it,

4027
02:05:47,760 --> 02:05:48,660
she was sick,

4028
02:05:52,650 --> 02:05:53,700
she wasn't getting better.

4029
02:05:54,090 --> 02:05:55,890
And my father was in the hospital,

4030
02:05:56,640 --> 02:05:57,480
he was in,

4031
02:05:57,510 --> 02:05:59,700
I guess his patient was in the tool room,

4032
02:06:00,150 --> 02:06:00,691
whatever,

4033
02:06:00,691 --> 02:06:01,270
whatever.

4034
02:06:01,270 --> 02:06:05,460
Then he became a doctor
and a help to get better.

4035
02:06:06,990 --> 02:06:08,430
She had a form of hepatitis,

4036
02:06:09,210 --> 02:06:10,043
um,

4037
02:06:10,080 --> 02:06:14,010
back in the days when you didn't get it
from needles only he could get it from

4038
02:06:14,011 --> 02:06:15,420
eating a bad clam,

4039
02:06:16,530 --> 02:06:17,363
whatever.

4040
02:06:17,700 --> 02:06:18,990
I don't know if it was c,

4041
02:06:18,991 --> 02:06:19,830
whatever it is,

4042
02:06:20,310 --> 02:06:22,380
I'm not going to tell you
because I don't know for sure,

4043
02:06:22,381 --> 02:06:23,214
but,

4044
02:06:23,460 --> 02:06:27,330
and she was very sick and anyway,

4045
02:06:27,331 --> 02:06:27,780
he,

4046
02:06:27,780 --> 02:06:30,060
he took care of her and they got married.

4047
02:06:30,600 --> 02:06:32,880
They fell in love and
in all of that stuff.

4048
02:06:34,650 --> 02:06:35,483
So,

4049
02:06:36,090 --> 02:06:36,923
you know,

4050
02:06:38,310 --> 02:06:38,761
just,

4051
02:06:38,761 --> 02:06:39,594
um,

4052
02:06:40,260 --> 02:06:41,490
my father was a

4053
02:06:42,890 --> 02:06:43,630
okay.

4054
02:06:43,630 --> 02:06:44,141
Like I said,

4055
02:06:44,141 --> 02:06:45,070
my father was,

4056
02:06:45,830 --> 02:06:46,663
he,

4057
02:06:47,430 --> 02:06:48,640
he was dedicated to,

4058
02:06:48,641 --> 02:06:49,474
uh,

4059
02:06:49,570 --> 02:06:50,403
to that life.

4060
02:06:50,920 --> 02:06:51,753
Uh,

4061
02:06:51,910 --> 02:06:54,220
but the thing that he did
that I started to say,

4062
02:06:55,390 --> 02:06:57,130
and I don't want to give
that background I guess,

4063
02:06:57,131 --> 02:06:57,964
but

4064
02:07:00,730 --> 02:07:01,240
my,

4065
02:07:01,240 --> 02:07:01,910
my,

4066
02:07:01,910 --> 02:07:03,620
my mother was very emotional.

4067
02:07:03,800 --> 02:07:04,820
My father's a doctor.

4068
02:07:04,821 --> 02:07:05,990
He hid his emotions.

4069
02:07:07,230 --> 02:07:07,530
Okay.

4070
02:07:07,530 --> 02:07:09,570
And when Todd one for surgery,

4071
02:07:09,571 --> 02:07:11,070
he died on the operating table.

4072
02:07:12,210 --> 02:07:13,380
He had told my mother,

4073
02:07:13,950 --> 02:07:15,120
my father never lied.

4074
02:07:16,370 --> 02:07:16,880
Yeah,

4075
02:07:16,880 --> 02:07:18,080
he told her the risk.

4076
02:07:18,500 --> 02:07:20,750
But my mother want to believe
what you want to believe.

4077
02:07:21,050 --> 02:07:21,771
My mother said,

4078
02:07:21,771 --> 02:07:23,150
you said it would be okay.

4079
02:07:25,740 --> 02:07:26,010
No,

4080
02:07:26,010 --> 02:07:26,821
he didn't say that,

4081
02:07:26,821 --> 02:07:27,654
but you know.

4082
02:07:28,510 --> 02:07:29,940
But of course my mother,

4083
02:07:30,120 --> 02:07:31,620
my father was high level to

4084
02:07:33,510 --> 02:07:34,343
you know,

4085
02:07:34,770 --> 02:07:35,603
made her better.

4086
02:07:35,670 --> 02:07:36,880
It can make you sound better.

4087
02:07:38,170 --> 02:07:39,130
So he died,

4088
02:07:40,090 --> 02:07:41,200
we all got split up.

4089
02:07:43,090 --> 02:07:46,780
I had to live with an uncle that was
single and it was a very handsome guy.

4090
02:07:48,040 --> 02:07:51,610
So he had girlfriend coming in
and out all the time and you know,

4091
02:07:51,660 --> 02:07:52,180
lose.

4092
02:07:52,180 --> 02:07:52,841
And you know,

4093
02:07:52,841 --> 02:07:53,674
he was young,

4094
02:07:54,580 --> 02:07:57,910
good looking guy and like to go out.

4095
02:07:58,330 --> 02:08:00,490
I'd wind up sitting in
a bar waiting for them.

4096
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:02,740
I get a lot of bags of potato chips,

4097
02:08:04,200 --> 02:08:05,200
a lot of cokes,

4098
02:08:05,980 --> 02:08:06,371
you know,

4099
02:08:06,371 --> 02:08:07,540
he could finally come back.

4100
02:08:07,541 --> 02:08:08,800
I have eight cokes in front of me,

4101
02:08:10,180 --> 02:08:11,013
maybe 10,

4102
02:08:12,940 --> 02:08:13,540
you know,

4103
02:08:13,540 --> 02:08:14,373
and um,

4104
02:08:14,470 --> 02:08:17,140
we got split up from my mother
was sleeping in a cemetery.

4105
02:08:18,250 --> 02:08:19,210
She had a nervous breakdown,

4106
02:08:20,670 --> 02:08:21,341
but you know,

4107
02:08:21,341 --> 02:08:22,390
she got herself together.

4108
02:08:22,391 --> 02:08:23,290
She overcame it.

4109
02:08:24,460 --> 02:08:24,761
But,

4110
02:08:24,761 --> 02:08:25,594
um,

4111
02:08:28,430 --> 02:08:29,560
she never forgave him.

4112
02:08:31,400 --> 02:08:32,110
Yeah.

4113
02:08:32,110 --> 02:08:32,650
You know,

4114
02:08:32,650 --> 02:08:33,483
and um,

4115
02:08:35,020 --> 02:08:35,231
you know,

4116
02:08:35,231 --> 02:08:38,440
she was Irish and then the easy thing
is to Irish cars and all that stuff,

4117
02:08:38,441 --> 02:08:39,101
but you know,

4118
02:08:39,101 --> 02:08:39,934
she trying.

4119
02:08:41,890 --> 02:08:42,723
But um,

4120
02:08:43,360 --> 02:08:44,193
okay.

4121
02:08:45,240 --> 02:08:45,721
She,

4122
02:08:45,721 --> 02:08:46,554
uh,

4123
02:08:47,310 --> 02:08:52,310
she's a great woman but you don't
see was tragically hard and you know,

4124
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,220
everyone copes with things
differently and she,

4125
02:08:56,240 --> 02:08:57,073
uh,

4126
02:08:57,630 --> 02:08:58,170
it was,

4127
02:08:58,170 --> 02:08:59,003
it was difficult.

4128
02:08:59,220 --> 02:09:01,280
And that day with all of the,

4129
02:09:01,320 --> 02:09:02,520
what I just described,

4130
02:09:02,521 --> 02:09:02,971
and again,

4131
02:09:02,971 --> 02:09:04,140
I'm always afraid to say it,

4132
02:09:04,500 --> 02:09:07,020
but you say it because it's part of it,

4133
02:09:07,050 --> 02:09:07,883
right?

4134
02:09:08,340 --> 02:09:09,240
Maybe it explains,

4135
02:09:09,241 --> 02:09:09,690
maybe,

4136
02:09:09,690 --> 02:09:11,970
maybe some people hold it
against him when I say this,

4137
02:09:13,080 --> 02:09:17,860
but he got a phone call that
day on his answer and surface.

4138
02:09:17,880 --> 02:09:19,530
You didn't have pages in those days.

4139
02:09:19,830 --> 02:09:21,120
He had an answering service.

4140
02:09:21,480 --> 02:09:26,310
He told them to call them when
he had request for house calls.

4141
02:09:26,640 --> 02:09:28,530
Two in the morning as a kid,

4142
02:09:28,770 --> 02:09:30,270
I used to hear the phone ring.

4143
02:09:30,420 --> 02:09:31,460
It was two in the morning.

4144
02:09:31,850 --> 02:09:33,300
I started getting dressed.

4145
02:09:33,301 --> 02:09:35,680
I came out and I was on the
stairs waiting for the golf.

4146
02:09:36,860 --> 02:09:37,920
He looked at me,

4147
02:09:37,921 --> 02:09:38,101
what,

4148
02:09:38,101 --> 02:09:38,611
what are you doing?

4149
02:09:38,611 --> 02:09:39,050
I'm going,

4150
02:09:39,050 --> 02:09:40,380
which you know,

4151
02:09:40,390 --> 02:09:41,560
you're not kept back in the mall.

4152
02:09:43,020 --> 02:09:43,740
You know,

4153
02:09:43,740 --> 02:09:45,030
sometimes you let me go with them.

4154
02:09:46,260 --> 02:09:47,093
And um,

4155
02:09:48,660 --> 02:09:48,991
anyway,

4156
02:09:48,991 --> 02:09:49,471
this day,

4157
02:09:49,471 --> 02:09:53,130
obviously it was a
different day and there was,

4158
02:09:53,550 --> 02:09:58,380
his patient has patient's
daughter had a child who was very,

4159
02:09:58,381 --> 02:09:59,310
very sick.

4160
02:10:01,020 --> 02:10:03,610
She did not know that has son the mother.

4161
02:10:03,611 --> 02:10:03,841
No,

4162
02:10:03,841 --> 02:10:06,570
but the daughter didn't know
that his son died that day.

4163
02:10:06,600 --> 02:10:08,130
That his son was buried that day,

4164
02:10:08,131 --> 02:10:08,964
I should say.

4165
02:10:11,390 --> 02:10:12,223
So she called,

4166
02:10:13,590 --> 02:10:16,620
he went and did a house call on a day.

4167
02:10:16,621 --> 02:10:17,430
That is,

4168
02:10:17,430 --> 02:10:18,263
you know,

4169
02:10:19,320 --> 02:10:20,153
okay.

4170
02:10:20,450 --> 02:10:21,680
That his son got Barry.

4171
02:10:23,270 --> 02:10:23,541
You know,

4172
02:10:23,541 --> 02:10:24,374
that's tough.

4173
02:10:25,220 --> 02:10:26,030
But that was what,

4174
02:10:26,030 --> 02:10:26,301
you know,

4175
02:10:26,301 --> 02:10:27,330
that's what his,

4176
02:10:27,620 --> 02:10:28,251
that's what his,

4177
02:10:28,251 --> 02:10:29,084
um,

4178
02:10:29,480 --> 02:10:32,990
so when people tell me that
they can't keep a commitment,

4179
02:10:33,320 --> 02:10:34,153
this happened,

4180
02:10:35,150 --> 02:10:36,320
it doesn't go with me.

4181
02:10:37,100 --> 02:10:37,933
That's all.

4182
02:10:38,390 --> 02:10:40,260
And that day after I buried my father,

4183
02:10:40,261 --> 02:10:41,180
I went to the gym

4184
02:10:42,680 --> 02:10:43,970
and I trained Michael Moore

4185
02:10:46,460 --> 02:10:47,300
because I was,

4186
02:10:47,301 --> 02:10:47,541
you know,

4187
02:10:47,541 --> 02:10:48,560
that's what I was doing.

4188
02:10:48,680 --> 02:10:49,513
That was my job,

4189
02:10:53,840 --> 02:10:54,673
character,

4190
02:10:56,030 --> 02:10:56,870
real character.

4191
02:10:57,620 --> 02:10:57,921
I mean,

4192
02:10:57,921 --> 02:10:59,060
whatever it is it is,

4193
02:10:59,061 --> 02:11:00,050
but whatever it is,

4194
02:11:00,051 --> 02:11:00,520
that's true.

4195
02:11:00,520 --> 02:11:00,860
You know,

4196
02:11:00,860 --> 02:11:02,720
call it whatever name,

4197
02:11:02,721 --> 02:11:03,890
whatever noise you want to make.

4198
02:11:05,270 --> 02:11:06,560
There's not a lot of people like that.

4199
02:11:07,130 --> 02:11:08,120
That explains a lot.

4200
02:11:10,640 --> 02:11:14,480
Explains a lot about your unyielding

4201
02:11:16,370 --> 02:11:19,280
understanding and appreciation
of real commitment.

4202
02:11:22,810 --> 02:11:23,111
Yeah.

4203
02:11:23,111 --> 02:11:23,530
I mean,

4204
02:11:23,530 --> 02:11:24,363
I mean that's,

4205
02:11:24,370 --> 02:11:24,790
that's,

4206
02:11:24,790 --> 02:11:25,001
yeah,

4207
02:11:25,001 --> 02:11:25,834
that's,

4208
02:11:27,130 --> 02:11:27,491
and it's,

4209
02:11:27,491 --> 02:11:28,720
we almost don't have a choice,

4210
02:11:28,721 --> 02:11:28,961
you know,

4211
02:11:28,961 --> 02:11:31,510
because to not

4212
02:11:33,130 --> 02:11:33,431
listen,

4213
02:11:33,431 --> 02:11:34,264
you just do it.

4214
02:11:34,570 --> 02:11:35,890
But to not follow that,

4215
02:11:40,170 --> 02:11:41,400
in some ways it's,

4216
02:11:42,020 --> 02:11:44,280
it's like you're not honoring your father

4217
02:11:46,050 --> 02:11:49,080
because your father's
leave you certain things,

4218
02:11:49,380 --> 02:11:49,621
you know,

4219
02:11:49,621 --> 02:11:50,454
they leave you,

4220
02:11:50,490 --> 02:11:51,060
you know,

4221
02:11:51,060 --> 02:11:51,571
something in the,

4222
02:11:51,571 --> 02:11:54,690
well maybe they'd leave your whatever.

4223
02:11:54,720 --> 02:11:59,100
They might leave your special trinket
of something that he always remember a

4224
02:11:59,101 --> 02:11:59,621
car,

4225
02:11:59,621 --> 02:12:00,450
a little thing,

4226
02:12:00,450 --> 02:12:01,283
whatever,

4227
02:12:01,860 --> 02:12:03,840
but they leave you something.

4228
02:12:04,380 --> 02:12:06,210
If you're fortunate
enough to have a father,

4229
02:12:07,650 --> 02:12:08,700
I know not everyone is,

4230
02:12:08,730 --> 02:12:09,563
I get it.

4231
02:12:10,080 --> 02:12:12,180
But when they leave you that

4232
02:12:13,800 --> 02:12:14,633
you,

4233
02:12:15,210 --> 02:12:16,043
you got to,

4234
02:12:18,420 --> 02:12:19,260
you got to cherish it.

4235
02:12:21,420 --> 02:12:22,253
You should.

4236
02:12:22,680 --> 02:12:23,790
And that's what he left me.

4237
02:12:24,240 --> 02:12:26,280
So to be,

4238
02:12:26,880 --> 02:12:31,880
it's not that I'm a good guy or bad
guy or great guy or less or anything.

4239
02:12:31,891 --> 02:12:32,460
I'm not,

4240
02:12:32,460 --> 02:12:33,330
I'm not any of that.

4241
02:12:33,570 --> 02:12:37,230
But I'm loyal to that because

4242
02:12:39,210 --> 02:12:40,380
you should be loyal to that.

4243
02:12:40,870 --> 02:12:41,940
Does that makes sense?

4244
02:12:41,970 --> 02:12:42,803
I mean,

4245
02:12:43,320 --> 02:12:43,870
you know,

4246
02:12:43,870 --> 02:12:45,630
I'm loyal to that idea.

4247
02:12:45,631 --> 02:12:46,890
I'm loyal to that living.

4248
02:12:46,891 --> 02:12:47,850
I'm a loyal to that,

4249
02:12:48,660 --> 02:12:49,493
that

4250
02:12:53,600 --> 02:12:56,840
to start stance that he
took and living his life,

4251
02:12:58,190 --> 02:12:59,810
that belief that,

4252
02:13:00,170 --> 02:13:01,003
you know,

4253
02:13:03,270 --> 02:13:04,500
principle of living,

4254
02:13:04,501 --> 02:13:06,590
whatever you want to call
a code of whatever you,

4255
02:13:07,260 --> 02:13:09,750
all those words that make it sound better.

4256
02:13:10,170 --> 02:13:11,003
But

4257
02:13:13,620 --> 02:13:15,050
I would feel that I,

4258
02:13:15,420 --> 02:13:16,253
uh,

4259
02:13:16,320 --> 02:13:18,090
by not doing it that way,

4260
02:13:18,990 --> 02:13:23,010
when you're lucky enough to have a man
that kind of torture what he taught you

4261
02:13:23,011 --> 02:13:24,360
without talking too much.

4262
02:13:25,110 --> 02:13:25,501
Um,

4263
02:13:25,501 --> 02:13:28,290
and I might be the greatest
teacher is by seeing,

4264
02:13:28,550 --> 02:13:29,383
right

4265
02:13:30,630 --> 02:13:31,560
examples it,

4266
02:13:32,760 --> 02:13:34,190
but if you don't honor that,

4267
02:13:36,050 --> 02:13:36,470
okay,

4268
02:13:36,470 --> 02:13:37,920
then you're not on your father

4269
02:13:40,200 --> 02:13:41,160
what he stood for.

4270
02:13:41,400 --> 02:13:43,470
And at the end of the
day I was pissed because

4271
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:45,833
okay,

4272
02:13:46,400 --> 02:13:47,720
for everything that he did,

4273
02:13:48,350 --> 02:13:49,040
there's not,

4274
02:13:49,040 --> 02:13:49,873
there's no,

4275
02:13:50,060 --> 02:13:52,700
I know that sounds foolish,

4276
02:13:52,701 --> 02:13:54,230
but there's no statue of him.

4277
02:13:55,970 --> 02:13:57,080
And so,

4278
02:13:58,270 --> 02:14:03,270
and for me there should be something
because he did it his whole life.

4279
02:14:05,270 --> 02:14:05,541
You know,

4280
02:14:05,541 --> 02:14:07,400
we all have moments of,

4281
02:14:10,100 --> 02:14:10,933
of light,

4282
02:14:10,970 --> 02:14:11,930
of moments of

4283
02:14:13,730 --> 02:14:15,590
where we maybe worry about what's,

4284
02:14:15,650 --> 02:14:16,191
what's there,

4285
02:14:16,191 --> 02:14:18,020
when we're gone and where we're going.

4286
02:14:18,021 --> 02:14:19,580
And maybe we change and I've seen it,

4287
02:14:19,581 --> 02:14:20,420
I've seen it with friends,

4288
02:14:20,421 --> 02:14:20,871
I get it,

4289
02:14:20,871 --> 02:14:21,591
I understand that.

4290
02:14:21,591 --> 02:14:25,750
But where we start trying to
live differently because we,

4291
02:14:25,870 --> 02:14:28,490
we start wondering about
what's coming next,

4292
02:14:28,520 --> 02:14:29,360
when we're gone,

4293
02:14:30,050 --> 02:14:30,651
death,

4294
02:14:30,651 --> 02:14:30,981
whatever,

4295
02:14:30,981 --> 02:14:31,371
you know,

4296
02:14:31,371 --> 02:14:32,780
but what's there.

4297
02:14:33,170 --> 02:14:35,180
And so we start thinking
about that a little bit.

4298
02:14:35,181 --> 02:14:37,190
Maybe I've seen people influenced by that.

4299
02:14:37,191 --> 02:14:38,024
I have,

4300
02:14:38,210 --> 02:14:38,841
you have to,

4301
02:14:38,841 --> 02:14:39,674
I'm sure.

4302
02:14:40,290 --> 02:14:43,490
And he was not influenced by that.

4303
02:14:44,360 --> 02:14:46,040
It was just what he was.

4304
02:14:47,360 --> 02:14:48,740
He was that his whole life.

4305
02:14:50,360 --> 02:14:54,950
And the only thing that I can think,

4306
02:14:55,700 --> 02:14:58,580
because I try to put pieces
together a little bit of what he,

4307
02:14:58,670 --> 02:15:01,460
how he got that way and

4308
02:15:03,530 --> 02:15:05,570
all I know from people when he died,

4309
02:15:05,571 --> 02:15:05,811
you know,

4310
02:15:05,811 --> 02:15:06,830
patients come up to you,

4311
02:15:06,831 --> 02:15:08,240
they're great and they
want to tell you something,

4312
02:15:08,241 --> 02:15:09,074
you know,

4313
02:15:09,380 --> 02:15:11,600
and they,

4314
02:15:11,870 --> 02:15:12,703
they told me,

4315
02:15:13,730 --> 02:15:14,450
you know,

4316
02:15:14,450 --> 02:15:17,420
that they were porn on the
neighborhood and everything.

4317
02:15:17,470 --> 02:15:22,040
A neighborhood called Mirin is Harper
down by the water in stat now and rough

4318
02:15:22,041 --> 02:15:22,401
place,

4319
02:15:22,401 --> 02:15:23,234
you know.

4320
02:15:23,780 --> 02:15:24,613
And um,

4321
02:15:26,640 --> 02:15:27,473
okay.

4322
02:15:27,500 --> 02:15:29,900
They told me that his
mother was a tough woman.

4323
02:15:31,070 --> 02:15:35,390
She didn't have a tough woman
and they was three sons,

4324
02:15:35,690 --> 02:15:36,051
you know.

4325
02:15:36,051 --> 02:15:38,120
And they were originally
from day one born.

4326
02:15:38,121 --> 02:15:39,360
They were born here but she,

4327
02:15:39,480 --> 02:15:40,313
they were from,

4328
02:15:40,550 --> 02:15:41,270
from Europe,

4329
02:15:41,270 --> 02:15:41,840
you know,

4330
02:15:41,840 --> 02:15:43,650
and they had just,

4331
02:15:43,910 --> 02:15:45,530
you had to be with the mother.

4332
02:15:45,710 --> 02:15:47,240
The mother told them what they had to be.

4333
02:15:48,650 --> 02:15:50,360
She told each one what you're going to be.

4334
02:15:50,780 --> 02:15:52,070
The oldest was my father.

4335
02:15:52,071 --> 02:15:56,000
Like I was the oldest and Eugene,

4336
02:15:56,210 --> 02:15:57,770
you're going to be an orthodontist.

4337
02:15:57,890 --> 02:15:59,090
He became an orthodontist.

4338
02:15:59,091 --> 02:15:59,924
Very successful.

4339
02:16:01,400 --> 02:16:02,900
Raddled you're going to be an engineer.

4340
02:16:03,080 --> 02:16:04,100
Boeing aircraft.

4341
02:16:04,520 --> 02:16:05,840
Unbelievably successful,

4342
02:16:05,841 --> 02:16:06,674
lived in Seattle.

4343
02:16:07,610 --> 02:16:08,443
Theodore,

4344
02:16:08,780 --> 02:16:09,261
the oldest,

4345
02:16:09,261 --> 02:16:10,094
her favorite.

4346
02:16:10,580 --> 02:16:10,861
You know,

4347
02:16:10,861 --> 02:16:11,990
you're not supposed to have a favorite,

4348
02:16:11,991 --> 02:16:13,280
but it's real,

4349
02:16:13,281 --> 02:16:14,114
right?

4350
02:16:14,360 --> 02:16:15,193
You have favorites.

4351
02:16:16,310 --> 02:16:17,300
You're going to be a doctor.

4352
02:16:17,780 --> 02:16:18,613
My oldest son,

4353
02:16:19,370 --> 02:16:20,240
you're going to be a doctor.

4354
02:16:21,080 --> 02:16:22,220
He wanted to be a builder.

4355
02:16:24,490 --> 02:16:25,730
He wanted to build.

4356
02:16:26,570 --> 02:16:27,403
He did both.

4357
02:16:27,890 --> 02:16:30,180
He built over a hundred hours on stone.

4358
02:16:30,190 --> 02:16:32,890
He built tiff and things and
how the fuck did he do that?

4359
02:16:32,950 --> 02:16:34,840
He did it as he was a doctor.

4360
02:16:34,870 --> 02:16:36,730
How did he have the time he bought,

4361
02:16:36,731 --> 02:16:37,660
he had contractor,

4362
02:16:37,790 --> 02:16:39,250
you know guy that did it,

4363
02:16:39,310 --> 02:16:40,050
but he,

4364
02:16:40,050 --> 02:16:41,620
he did that cause that was his passion.

4365
02:16:41,650 --> 02:16:42,161
Well he did,

4366
02:16:42,161 --> 02:16:42,581
but no,

4367
02:16:42,581 --> 02:16:43,090
but no,

4368
02:16:43,090 --> 02:16:43,240
no.

4369
02:16:43,240 --> 02:16:44,320
She was smarter than him.

4370
02:16:44,321 --> 02:16:45,580
She was smarter than anyone.

4371
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:47,530
He was supposed to be a doctor.

4372
02:16:48,100 --> 02:16:52,480
He was one of the greatest
diagnostic doctors ever.

4373
02:16:52,630 --> 02:16:52,931
I know.

4374
02:16:52,931 --> 02:16:53,651
It's my father.

4375
02:16:53,651 --> 02:16:54,461
I know the whole thing.

4376
02:16:54,461 --> 02:16:54,911
I get it.

4377
02:16:54,911 --> 02:16:56,050
But he really was.

4378
02:16:56,590 --> 02:16:57,251
You walked in,

4379
02:16:57,251 --> 02:16:58,360
he knew what was wrong with you.

4380
02:16:58,630 --> 02:16:59,261
There's a great,

4381
02:16:59,261 --> 02:16:59,680
again,

4382
02:16:59,680 --> 02:17:01,510
we don't know like the Babe Ruth thing.

4383
02:17:01,720 --> 02:17:03,430
We don't know the complete truth to it,

4384
02:17:03,640 --> 02:17:06,160
but there's a great legendary
story that a guy walked in,

4385
02:17:06,161 --> 02:17:07,540
he had been to Mayo Clinic,

4386
02:17:07,570 --> 02:17:08,890
he had been to John Hopkins,

4387
02:17:08,891 --> 02:17:09,650
he had been everywhere.

4388
02:17:09,650 --> 02:17:10,420
It was dying.

4389
02:17:10,420 --> 02:17:11,161
That's all they know.

4390
02:17:11,161 --> 02:17:11,740
He was dying,

4391
02:17:11,740 --> 02:17:13,120
losing weight for an apart,

4392
02:17:13,330 --> 02:17:15,950
dying and nobody could diagnose him.

4393
02:17:16,120 --> 02:17:19,630
He walked into this place where you had
to wait five hours to see him because

4394
02:17:19,631 --> 02:17:24,631
the line was out the door because he was
had all the poor people and there were

4395
02:17:24,911 --> 02:17:26,500
cigarette burns and all the rugs,

4396
02:17:27,900 --> 02:17:28,870
and she was like,

4397
02:17:28,871 --> 02:17:29,704
where am I?

4398
02:17:30,040 --> 02:17:31,630
But when you got to them,

4399
02:17:31,690 --> 02:17:32,560
you know where you are.

4400
02:17:33,160 --> 02:17:34,450
And he went there.

4401
02:17:34,451 --> 02:17:35,290
Somebody sent them.

4402
02:17:35,291 --> 02:17:36,124
They went there,

4403
02:17:36,280 --> 02:17:37,210
and my father may,

4404
02:17:37,211 --> 02:17:39,970
all the patients leave and
he gave himself an injection.

4405
02:17:40,540 --> 02:17:41,800
That's the legendary story.

4406
02:17:42,910 --> 02:17:45,970
And I asked him about it
and I as it was a name,

4407
02:17:45,971 --> 02:17:47,110
I couldn't tell you the name,

4408
02:17:47,111 --> 02:17:47,650
whatever.

4409
02:17:47,650 --> 02:17:49,030
He made it real simple.

4410
02:17:49,031 --> 02:17:49,864
He said,

4411
02:17:49,900 --> 02:17:53,620
because he knew I watched movies and we
all watched movies and we owe her things

4412
02:17:53,621 --> 02:17:54,454
from different times.

4413
02:17:54,700 --> 02:17:59,680
And he said back in those days it would
have been called leprosy was some kind

4414
02:17:59,681 --> 02:18:00,514
of cancer

4415
02:18:01,930 --> 02:18:03,610
and I guess there was a contagious portal,

4416
02:18:03,670 --> 02:18:04,420
whatever.

4417
02:18:04,420 --> 02:18:09,420
And he got everyone out of the office
and he diagnosed the guy came sofas shot.

4418
02:18:10,950 --> 02:18:12,220
He would give himself a shot.

4419
02:18:12,240 --> 02:18:12,790
Yeah,

4420
02:18:12,790 --> 02:18:13,330
yeah,

4421
02:18:13,330 --> 02:18:14,650
too I guess.

4422
02:18:15,020 --> 02:18:15,853
I guess so.

4423
02:18:15,880 --> 02:18:16,570
I guess so.

4424
02:18:16,570 --> 02:18:17,650
I mean that's the story.

4425
02:18:17,830 --> 02:18:18,663
Right.

4426
02:18:19,090 --> 02:18:19,923
And um,

4427
02:18:21,280 --> 02:18:22,370
he said to me though,

4428
02:18:22,510 --> 02:18:24,880
the only definitive thing
I know about that story,

4429
02:18:25,570 --> 02:18:26,530
and it was a million of them,

4430
02:18:26,860 --> 02:18:27,140
you know,

4431
02:18:27,140 --> 02:18:27,880
similar,

4432
02:18:27,880 --> 02:18:32,880
but was that I bragged to my fault,

4433
02:18:33,580 --> 02:18:35,440
you're smarter than all
these other doctors.

4434
02:18:35,470 --> 02:18:35,880
And he said,

4435
02:18:35,880 --> 02:18:36,713
Norma

4436
02:18:38,350 --> 02:18:38,891
and I said,

4437
02:18:38,891 --> 02:18:40,470
but you found it and these other plays,

4438
02:18:41,710 --> 02:18:42,580
big hospital,

4439
02:18:42,730 --> 02:18:43,563
big problem.

4440
02:18:44,590 --> 02:18:45,760
I'm not a big hospital.

4441
02:18:47,080 --> 02:18:47,980
Big hospitals,

4442
02:18:48,190 --> 02:18:49,030
bigger problems.

4443
02:18:49,060 --> 02:18:49,271
I said,

4444
02:18:49,271 --> 02:18:54,271
what do you mean they have to do things
fast and with large numbers I don't.

4445
02:18:55,900 --> 02:18:56,830
So they have to,

4446
02:18:57,010 --> 02:18:58,120
it has to make sense.

4447
02:18:58,200 --> 02:18:59,650
Some things don't make sense.

4448
02:19:00,490 --> 02:19:01,323
That's what he told me.

4449
02:19:01,990 --> 02:19:02,411
He said,

4450
02:19:02,411 --> 02:19:03,910
so this particular day,

4451
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:05,230
they are smarter than me.

4452
02:19:05,440 --> 02:19:07,870
They knew the characteristics
of the disease.

4453
02:19:08,050 --> 02:19:09,100
They knew the symptoms.

4454
02:19:09,280 --> 02:19:10,930
They knew that it fit in here,

4455
02:19:11,230 --> 02:19:15,760
but that hadn't been around for 40
years in the continental United States

4456
02:19:15,761 --> 02:19:16,630
whenever he said to me.

4457
02:19:16,631 --> 02:19:17,920
But I remember it was something like that.

4458
02:19:18,160 --> 02:19:19,810
It hadn't been around for 40,

4459
02:19:19,811 --> 02:19:20,621
maybe it was 60,

4460
02:19:20,621 --> 02:19:21,370
but whatever,

4461
02:19:21,370 --> 02:19:22,270
it hadn't been around.

4462
02:19:22,390 --> 02:19:25,800
So they move right past that because
they had to go with a big hearts.

4463
02:19:25,801 --> 02:19:26,634
But Oh,

4464
02:19:26,680 --> 02:19:29,450
they got to go quick
because I don't have to,

4465
02:19:31,370 --> 02:19:35,900
he says it didn't make sense to
them because it was around 40 years.

4466
02:19:37,280 --> 02:19:40,430
But he says if it is almost
like of walks like a duck,

4467
02:19:40,640 --> 02:19:41,630
quacks like a duck,

4468
02:19:42,500 --> 02:19:43,460
maybe it's a doc.

4469
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:44,900
So he just stayed,

4470
02:19:44,901 --> 02:19:45,890
he could stay with that.

4471
02:19:46,160 --> 02:19:47,300
They couldn't stay with that.

4472
02:19:47,960 --> 02:19:49,220
And he stayed with and who was right.

4473
02:19:50,780 --> 02:19:51,613
And um,

4474
02:19:52,880 --> 02:19:54,440
he did a lot of things like that.

4475
02:19:54,470 --> 02:19:55,610
He was famous for that.

4476
02:19:56,060 --> 02:19:58,850
He was famous for people coming
from Brooklyn coming from Manhattan,

4477
02:19:59,060 --> 02:20:04,060
common over there to see this diagnose
cystic genius in his little basement

4478
02:20:05,840 --> 02:20:09,350
office where people opt out the block,

4479
02:20:09,590 --> 02:20:12,650
like the Wayne for Mcdonald's or pizza.

4480
02:20:13,580 --> 02:20:13,881
And,

4481
02:20:13,881 --> 02:20:14,714
um,

4482
02:20:15,510 --> 02:20:18,530
and it costs less than
Mcdonald's to a certain extent,

4483
02:20:18,680 --> 02:20:19,280
you know,

4484
02:20:19,280 --> 02:20:20,420
because if we didn't have money,

4485
02:20:20,430 --> 02:20:21,650
didn't charge it like I said,

4486
02:20:22,100 --> 02:20:22,820
but he uh,

4487
02:20:22,820 --> 02:20:23,601
but he made money,

4488
02:20:23,601 --> 02:20:24,434
well of course,

4489
02:20:24,980 --> 02:20:26,420
but he didn't make the money of the,

4490
02:20:26,690 --> 02:20:27,770
and he was a,

4491
02:20:28,130 --> 02:20:31,410
I tell you a great story to be a,

4492
02:20:31,430 --> 02:20:32,690
to have a nursing home.

4493
02:20:33,410 --> 02:20:36,350
Maybe this explains him the
best to have a nursing home.

4494
02:20:36,500 --> 02:20:39,080
You had to have a open on stand on it,

4495
02:20:39,081 --> 02:20:42,380
I guess anywhere in New York he had
to have a doctor was signed on as the

4496
02:20:42,381 --> 02:20:43,220
medical director.

4497
02:20:43,610 --> 02:20:46,770
The problem was they couldn't
pay it because the nursing
homes won't really make

4498
02:20:46,771 --> 02:20:47,604
them money.

4499
02:20:47,630 --> 02:20:50,360
So you just had to have
a doctor would be there.

4500
02:20:50,960 --> 02:20:52,430
None of them really wanted to do it.

4501
02:20:52,460 --> 02:20:55,470
So my father was a
medical director and just,

4502
02:20:56,300 --> 02:20:57,290
just bear with me,

4503
02:20:57,320 --> 02:21:00,530
I'm going to say of eight nursing
homes might have been five,

4504
02:21:00,850 --> 02:21:01,820
might have been nine.

4505
02:21:03,980 --> 02:21:05,630
So I would go with them on house calls.

4506
02:21:05,690 --> 02:21:06,710
That's how I hung out with them.

4507
02:21:07,250 --> 02:21:08,840
So I go with them or nursing homes.

4508
02:21:09,020 --> 02:21:10,250
So of course he didn't get paid.

4509
02:21:10,280 --> 02:21:11,130
He was directed,

4510
02:21:11,180 --> 02:21:12,950
but he figured if he was that,

4511
02:21:12,980 --> 02:21:14,030
he never told me this,

4512
02:21:15,140 --> 02:21:18,020
but I think it's okay to say it.

4513
02:21:19,550 --> 02:21:21,260
He figured if I'm going to be there,

4514
02:21:21,261 --> 02:21:22,400
I'm going to go see the patients.

4515
02:21:22,401 --> 02:21:22,701
I'm not,

4516
02:21:22,701 --> 02:21:23,660
so he didn't have to,

4517
02:21:24,470 --> 02:21:28,820
but he went once a week and he went into
each nursing home and I went with them

4518
02:21:28,821 --> 02:21:31,160
when I was with them
and he saw the patients.

4519
02:21:31,250 --> 02:21:33,230
So there's one day we go in and he's like,

4520
02:21:35,180 --> 02:21:37,700
he gets treated like royalty.

4521
02:21:37,701 --> 02:21:37,911
I mean,

4522
02:21:37,911 --> 02:21:38,411
he comes in,

4523
02:21:38,411 --> 02:21:40,760
the staff comes running out
from all the nurse stays.

4524
02:21:40,761 --> 02:21:41,594
They all come on,

4525
02:21:42,530 --> 02:21:42,801
you know,

4526
02:21:42,801 --> 02:21:43,820
and it made me feel good.

4527
02:21:44,840 --> 02:21:45,381
I was like,

4528
02:21:45,381 --> 02:21:46,214
wow,

4529
02:21:46,470 --> 02:21:47,600
I'm with a man.

4530
02:21:48,290 --> 02:21:49,850
So I'm following them around.

4531
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,700
We've gone down the hallway
and he's very humble.

4532
02:21:52,701 --> 02:21:53,720
He really truly is.

4533
02:21:53,721 --> 02:21:54,800
That word is overused,

4534
02:21:55,130 --> 02:21:58,550
but this guy was beyond the
humble like directed thing.

4535
02:21:58,551 --> 02:21:59,384
We'll go this way.

4536
02:21:59,450 --> 02:22:00,620
The the needle,

4537
02:22:00,920 --> 02:22:01,790
it was ridiculous.

4538
02:22:01,791 --> 02:22:03,440
He get mad if you said
some good about him.

4539
02:22:04,460 --> 02:22:05,293
So

4540
02:22:06,620 --> 02:22:07,700
they all colonies where he,

4541
02:22:07,730 --> 02:22:08,563
uh,

4542
02:22:08,750 --> 02:22:09,480
hey,

4543
02:22:09,480 --> 02:22:10,370
you have to charts.

4544
02:22:10,400 --> 02:22:10,760
Yeah,

4545
02:22:10,760 --> 02:22:11,480
come on.

4546
02:22:11,480 --> 02:22:14,360
So he's looking at the charge
to change his medicine,

4547
02:22:14,361 --> 02:22:15,210
give him 100 million,

4548
02:22:15,230 --> 02:22:15,561
you know,

4549
02:22:15,561 --> 02:22:19,260
the typical stuff that I know from
watching to Kildare or something.

4550
02:22:19,430 --> 02:22:20,263
Right.

4551
02:22:22,490 --> 02:22:23,323
So

4552
02:22:25,170 --> 02:22:25,651
looking,

4553
02:22:25,651 --> 02:22:25,921
you know,

4554
02:22:25,921 --> 02:22:26,070
and

4555
02:22:26,070 --> 02:22:27,770
he's doing his thing and he's going down.

4556
02:22:27,780 --> 02:22:28,850
I'm following him around.

4557
02:22:28,860 --> 02:22:29,693
I'm a,

4558
02:22:29,760 --> 02:22:30,720
I don't know how old I was,

4559
02:22:30,721 --> 02:22:31,920
but young 10

4560
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:39,090
11 so I'm found more
of a sudden this woman.

4561
02:22:40,550 --> 02:22:41,281
Do you ever see,

4562
02:22:41,281 --> 02:22:41,791
I don't know,

4563
02:22:41,791 --> 02:22:43,080
I jumped around with these things,

4564
02:22:43,081 --> 02:22:45,450
but you ever see the movie?

4565
02:22:45,720 --> 02:22:50,700
It was like comedy guy that was around
back then and he did like a bride of

4566
02:22:50,701 --> 02:22:52,440
Frankenstein and he did Brooks.

4567
02:22:52,500 --> 02:22:53,190
Yeah,

4568
02:22:53,190 --> 02:22:55,630
it was one of his movies and
the bride of Frankenstein,

4569
02:22:55,720 --> 02:22:57,260
the white hair who was like,

4570
02:22:57,720 --> 02:22:59,640
well this woman was the of Frankenstein.

4571
02:23:00,450 --> 02:23:05,450
She comes running out and she was the
shelf and she was like half nude and Hogan

4572
02:23:06,090 --> 02:23:11,010
was falling off and she's an older
lady and her white hair was like that.

4573
02:23:11,400 --> 02:23:15,840
And she comes running and she's yelling
incoherent and screaming and they jump

4574
02:23:16,800 --> 02:23:17,611
and they jump.

4575
02:23:17,611 --> 02:23:20,280
When he started putting straps around the,

4576
02:23:20,281 --> 02:23:21,990
I guess like the old white coat,

4577
02:23:21,991 --> 02:23:22,740
I guess.

4578
02:23:22,740 --> 02:23:23,490
And they got,

4579
02:23:23,490 --> 02:23:26,040
apparently she was tied up to a bed,

4580
02:23:26,190 --> 02:23:26,700
you know,

4581
02:23:26,700 --> 02:23:29,670
obviously back in those days they
didn't know how to deal with,

4582
02:23:29,671 --> 02:23:30,840
see now people the way,

4583
02:23:31,080 --> 02:23:31,261
you know,

4584
02:23:31,261 --> 02:23:32,220
it was a whole different thing.

4585
02:23:32,430 --> 02:23:32,701
I mean,

4586
02:23:32,701 --> 02:23:37,701
we're talking a lot of years ago and so
they had a tied up and she got loose and

4587
02:23:38,161 --> 02:23:39,830
her gown was falling off and she's,

4588
02:23:40,470 --> 02:23:41,340
and uh,

4589
02:23:42,120 --> 02:23:47,120
so they jump up on her and they're tying
her up and I'm watching this woman get

4590
02:23:47,461 --> 02:23:52,461
mugged in the nursing home that my father
to the medical director of and all of

4591
02:23:53,401 --> 02:23:53,911
a sudden he said,

4592
02:23:53,911 --> 02:23:54,744
leave it alone.

4593
02:23:55,670 --> 02:23:57,150
And he's still looking at his charts.

4594
02:23:57,151 --> 02:23:57,890
He's not like,

4595
02:23:57,890 --> 02:23:58,071
oh,

4596
02:23:58,071 --> 02:23:58,904
hey Yo,

4597
02:23:59,800 --> 02:24:00,633
uh,

4598
02:24:01,090 --> 02:24:01,923
law,

4599
02:24:02,790 --> 02:24:03,630
but it's okay.

4600
02:24:03,631 --> 02:24:04,464
She's fine.

4601
02:24:04,950 --> 02:24:06,320
She'll be all right.

4602
02:24:07,280 --> 02:24:08,130
She calmed down.

4603
02:24:09,270 --> 02:24:11,580
She was a little nuts,

4604
02:24:11,790 --> 02:24:12,623
but

4605
02:24:13,590 --> 02:24:14,450
she was not spank.

4606
02:24:14,451 --> 02:24:14,740
Right.

4607
02:24:14,740 --> 02:24:14,890
Yeah.

4608
02:24:14,890 --> 02:24:15,630
That's a fair,

4609
02:24:15,630 --> 02:24:16,280
that's,

4610
02:24:16,280 --> 02:24:17,790
it's okay to say it's realistic.

4611
02:24:18,030 --> 02:24:18,863
And

4612
02:24:21,060 --> 02:24:22,470
she comes over to my father,

4613
02:24:22,890 --> 02:24:23,251
she says,

4614
02:24:23,251 --> 02:24:24,084
Hey,

4615
02:24:24,420 --> 02:24:28,320
and he's writing and he starts walking.

4616
02:24:28,780 --> 02:24:29,760
She starts falling.

4617
02:24:31,060 --> 02:24:34,140
Now I'm a kid so I can figure it
all out the way I could later.

4618
02:24:34,170 --> 02:24:35,003
Right.

4619
02:24:35,370 --> 02:24:38,430
But she becomes his assistant basically.

4620
02:24:38,431 --> 02:24:40,920
She's following him around and she,

4621
02:24:40,921 --> 02:24:44,520
he's going to room to room and she's,

4622
02:24:44,790 --> 02:24:45,330
see,

4623
02:24:45,330 --> 02:24:46,440
I think he gave her,

4624
02:24:46,441 --> 02:24:47,520
if I remember correctly,

4625
02:24:47,521 --> 02:24:48,800
he gave her like the,

4626
02:24:48,801 --> 02:24:49,330
the,

4627
02:24:49,330 --> 02:24:52,380
the thing that you write on a billboard,

4628
02:24:52,410 --> 02:24:53,243
you know the thing,

4629
02:24:53,470 --> 02:24:54,140
uh,

4630
02:24:54,140 --> 02:24:54,540
yeah.

4631
02:24:54,540 --> 02:24:55,800
Clipboard to hold.

4632
02:24:55,950 --> 02:25:00,260
So she's holding a clipboard and she's
looking like she's making beliefs,

4633
02:25:00,261 --> 02:25:01,610
she's reading stuff and,

4634
02:25:01,660 --> 02:25:02,493
and,

4635
02:25:02,520 --> 02:25:04,110
and I'm like looking at the scene,

4636
02:25:04,111 --> 02:25:04,944
like,

4637
02:25:05,070 --> 02:25:05,461
you know,

4638
02:25:05,461 --> 02:25:06,181
but I'm a kid,

4639
02:25:06,181 --> 02:25:09,600
like I haven't seen all the
movies yet that I can compare it,

4640
02:25:09,601 --> 02:25:10,434
that there's,

4641
02:25:10,590 --> 02:25:11,670
this is out there,

4642
02:25:11,790 --> 02:25:12,623
you know what I mean?

4643
02:25:12,720 --> 02:25:13,980
This is freaking nuts.

4644
02:25:14,740 --> 02:25:15,200
And,

4645
02:25:15,200 --> 02:25:16,530
and she found around,

4646
02:25:16,531 --> 02:25:18,750
she's looking at the thing
and I think she's like Zane.

4647
02:25:18,770 --> 02:25:19,150
Yeah.

4648
02:25:19,150 --> 02:25:19,983
Yes.

4649
02:25:21,090 --> 02:25:22,350
And he's going and he's,

4650
02:25:22,440 --> 02:25:24,190
he's basically not even

4651
02:25:24,520 --> 02:25:25,301
paying attention.

4652
02:25:25,301 --> 02:25:26,134
He's just,

4653
02:25:26,410 --> 02:25:27,243
every once in a while I said,

4654
02:25:27,310 --> 02:25:28,143
let me hit the,

4655
02:25:28,180 --> 02:25:29,013
and he's the,

4656
02:25:29,290 --> 02:25:30,123
and all of a sudden,

4657
02:25:31,240 --> 02:25:32,410
and this is the part again,

4658
02:25:32,411 --> 02:25:35,050
just like the other thing I
think about leaving it out,

4659
02:25:35,230 --> 02:25:36,130
but if I leave it out,

4660
02:25:36,131 --> 02:25:37,180
it's not a story.

4661
02:25:37,510 --> 02:25:38,620
It's not a story.

4662
02:25:39,130 --> 02:25:40,360
Because if I left it like that,

4663
02:25:40,361 --> 02:25:41,440
it's a beautiful story.

4664
02:25:43,030 --> 02:25:48,030
But this is a beautiful story in its
own way because there's is what it is.

4665
02:25:48,460 --> 02:25:49,293
It's a real,

4666
02:25:49,900 --> 02:25:50,970
he's in front of,

4667
02:25:51,360 --> 02:25:52,510
and my mother was,

4668
02:25:52,620 --> 02:25:54,970
I described as she was his gorgeous,

4669
02:25:54,971 --> 02:25:57,910
beautiful woman that like could things,

4670
02:25:57,970 --> 02:25:59,710
my father could give a crap.

4671
02:26:00,580 --> 02:26:05,110
My father had ink stains exploding
in his white shirt pockets.

4672
02:26:05,410 --> 02:26:07,030
My mother would go crazy.

4673
02:26:07,480 --> 02:26:09,180
He went to Kmart and avi,

4674
02:26:09,190 --> 02:26:10,090
remember Kmart,

4675
02:26:10,270 --> 02:26:14,110
he went to Kmart and borders
all shoes for four 99 each,

4676
02:26:14,500 --> 02:26:17,440
maybe three 90 [inaudible] plastic shoes.

4677
02:26:17,740 --> 02:26:19,570
And my mother was buying
him leather shoes.

4678
02:26:19,720 --> 02:26:20,710
He never warned them.

4679
02:26:20,711 --> 02:26:23,230
If he knew what she paid
for me would have went nuts.

4680
02:26:24,370 --> 02:26:27,490
Waste waste for what?

4681
02:26:28,030 --> 02:26:28,750
That was his,

4682
02:26:28,750 --> 02:26:29,583
that was him.

4683
02:26:29,710 --> 02:26:32,800
So he's got these plants
and shoes and you know,

4684
02:26:32,801 --> 02:26:36,790
he's got the inks blow up in
his pockets and everything else.

4685
02:26:37,330 --> 02:26:39,280
And My mother would always get upset,

4686
02:26:39,430 --> 02:26:40,300
always mad.

4687
02:26:40,330 --> 02:26:41,950
Why do you wear those shoes?

4688
02:26:41,951 --> 02:26:42,100
I,

4689
02:26:42,100 --> 02:26:42,670
yeah,

4690
02:26:42,670 --> 02:26:43,760
but he does.

4691
02:26:44,380 --> 02:26:49,300
So he's walking in front of her and
all of a sudden everything changes.

4692
02:26:50,710 --> 02:26:51,700
The woman goes,

4693
02:26:53,140 --> 02:26:54,460
he's neither doctor

4694
02:26:56,140 --> 02:26:56,973
he'd see.

4695
02:26:57,070 --> 02:26:57,940
She flipped on him.

4696
02:26:58,060 --> 02:26:59,020
Can you imagine this?

4697
02:26:59,680 --> 02:27:01,720
She could have to be in so great to her.

4698
02:27:02,590 --> 02:27:06,370
He's not a barely gets his
attention still walking.

4699
02:27:07,330 --> 02:27:08,610
He's not a doctor.

4700
02:27:08,620 --> 02:27:09,453
Everybody.

4701
02:27:09,490 --> 02:27:11,170
He's got holes in his shoes.

4702
02:27:12,250 --> 02:27:13,050
I looked down,

4703
02:27:13,050 --> 02:27:13,960
his foot goes up,

4704
02:27:13,990 --> 02:27:14,910
he's got a whole new shoes,

4705
02:27:14,940 --> 02:27:16,450
socks to out the shoe.

4706
02:27:17,340 --> 02:27:18,173
She was right.

4707
02:27:18,760 --> 02:27:21,700
He's got a hold of those freaking
show and his plastic shoe.

4708
02:27:22,720 --> 02:27:23,560
He doesn't care.

4709
02:27:24,710 --> 02:27:25,000
She,

4710
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:25,780
he,

4711
02:27:25,780 --> 02:27:26,800
he can't be a doctor.

4712
02:27:26,801 --> 02:27:27,970
He's got holes in his shoes

4713
02:27:29,950 --> 02:27:30,191
now.

4714
02:27:30,191 --> 02:27:31,024
He turns around,

4715
02:27:32,560 --> 02:27:33,393
he looks at her.

4716
02:27:34,350 --> 02:27:35,440
I never forget this.

4717
02:27:36,040 --> 02:27:37,180
He pats her on her head,

4718
02:27:37,450 --> 02:27:37,751
says,

4719
02:27:37,751 --> 02:27:38,710
you're not so crazy.

4720
02:27:42,380 --> 02:27:46,690
Pats her on the head just like this
and neither in a demeaning way like you

4721
02:27:46,691 --> 02:27:47,231
might think.

4722
02:27:47,231 --> 02:27:48,064
You know what I mean?

4723
02:27:48,280 --> 02:27:48,641
Really?

4724
02:27:48,641 --> 02:27:51,100
He touched her on her head and said,

4725
02:27:51,101 --> 02:27:51,640
you're not,

4726
02:27:51,640 --> 02:27:52,810
you're not so crazy.

4727
02:27:53,550 --> 02:27:54,470
It turned around,

4728
02:27:54,500 --> 02:27:56,020
took the billboard and kept walking.

4729
02:27:56,560 --> 02:27:57,700
She didn't say another word.

4730
02:28:03,360 --> 02:28:04,193
Wow.

4731
02:28:06,070 --> 02:28:11,070
My mother was freaking embarrassed and
mad because I told the story when I got

4732
02:28:11,411 --> 02:28:14,290
home and of course he would never tell it.

4733
02:28:14,830 --> 02:28:15,970
And I said,

4734
02:28:15,971 --> 02:28:16,181
you know,

4735
02:28:16,181 --> 02:28:16,481
dad,

4736
02:28:16,481 --> 02:28:16,661
you know,

4737
02:28:16,661 --> 02:28:17,980
I said it like a kid would say,

4738
02:28:18,550 --> 02:28:18,761
you know,

4739
02:28:18,761 --> 02:28:19,511
this ladies said,

4740
02:28:19,511 --> 02:28:19,721
you know,

4741
02:28:19,721 --> 02:28:20,554
he's got a horse.

4742
02:28:21,020 --> 02:28:21,920
Oh my God.

4743
02:28:22,820 --> 02:28:23,420
You know,

4744
02:28:23,420 --> 02:28:24,250
Jesus,

4745
02:28:24,250 --> 02:28:24,890
you know?

4746
02:28:24,890 --> 02:28:25,470
Right.

4747
02:28:25,470 --> 02:28:26,303
Didn't meet anything.

4748
02:28:27,620 --> 02:28:27,880
Yeah.

4749
02:28:27,880 --> 02:28:32,620
Well that makes just
this your description,

4750
02:28:32,621 --> 02:28:35,140
your understanding of your father,

4751
02:28:35,141 --> 02:28:36,670
it just makes so much sense.

4752
02:28:37,280 --> 02:28:39,460
So much sense of who you are and why you,

4753
02:28:39,461 --> 02:28:42,040
why your principles are so rigid,

4754
02:28:42,550 --> 02:28:43,130
why you're,

4755
02:28:43,130 --> 02:28:44,980
you're intolerant of any bullshit.

4756
02:28:45,580 --> 02:28:46,810
Just makes so much sense

4757
02:28:49,300 --> 02:28:53,830
as a fight trainer and as a guy who
understands fighters is a commentator and

4758
02:28:53,831 --> 02:28:55,630
makes so much sense that you,

4759
02:28:55,660 --> 02:29:00,660
you have this just unyielding
need for 100% commitment.

4760
02:29:03,950 --> 02:29:04,281
Yeah.

4761
02:29:04,281 --> 02:29:05,114
I mean,

4762
02:29:07,160 --> 02:29:07,993
so just told her,

4763
02:29:08,070 --> 02:29:08,590
listen,

4764
02:29:08,590 --> 02:29:11,180
it doesn't make me a better
person or anything else to say.

4765
02:29:13,220 --> 02:29:15,770
I don't have tolerance for the BS.

4766
02:29:15,800 --> 02:29:16,633
Right.

4767
02:29:17,360 --> 02:29:19,010
Because I know it to be bs.

4768
02:29:19,100 --> 02:29:19,933
Right.

4769
02:29:20,360 --> 02:29:20,920
You know,

4770
02:29:20,920 --> 02:29:21,120
I,

4771
02:29:21,120 --> 02:29:23,060
I say to we,

4772
02:29:23,230 --> 02:29:27,360
we were running these gyms
in la for the last nine.

4773
02:29:27,361 --> 02:29:28,071
You're 22 years.

4774
02:29:28,071 --> 02:29:28,904
I've listened.

4775
02:29:28,910 --> 02:29:29,361
When he died,

4776
02:29:29,361 --> 02:29:30,980
I started to talk to Atlas Foundation

4777
02:29:33,260 --> 02:29:33,680
again.

4778
02:29:33,680 --> 02:29:34,501
There was no statute.

4779
02:29:34,501 --> 02:29:35,270
Okay.

4780
02:29:35,270 --> 02:29:36,800
So I really,

4781
02:29:36,920 --> 02:29:41,920
I went to a supreme court judge who was
a friend on [inaudible] because I used

4782
02:29:43,101 --> 02:29:46,160
to be in front of the judge is
when I was young and a bad way.

4783
02:29:46,610 --> 02:29:47,040
And,

4784
02:29:47,040 --> 02:29:47,873
uh,

4785
02:29:48,310 --> 02:29:49,760
because I got myself in a little trouble,

4786
02:29:50,140 --> 02:29:50,973
stupid,

4787
02:29:51,290 --> 02:29:51,710
you know,

4788
02:29:51,710 --> 02:29:52,730
but I got to the right place.

4789
02:29:52,731 --> 02:29:53,564
That's what counts,

4790
02:29:54,080 --> 02:29:54,410
right.

4791
02:29:54,410 --> 02:29:55,243
I think.

4792
02:29:55,400 --> 02:29:55,701
And,

4793
02:29:55,701 --> 02:29:56,060
um,

4794
02:29:56,060 --> 02:29:56,410
but,

4795
02:29:56,410 --> 02:29:56,590
uh,

4796
02:29:56,590 --> 02:30:00,050
I always got a kick out of it that I
could hang out with the judge and I didn't

4797
02:30:00,051 --> 02:30:01,610
have to be in a court to do it,

4798
02:30:01,640 --> 02:30:02,120
you know?

4799
02:30:02,120 --> 02:30:02,930
Right.

4800
02:30:02,930 --> 02:30:04,930
And I didn't have to be
standing like in front of them.

4801
02:30:04,931 --> 02:30:06,500
I could be on the side of like,

4802
02:30:06,590 --> 02:30:07,423
hey,

4803
02:30:08,930 --> 02:30:09,763
so,

4804
02:30:10,100 --> 02:30:10,933
um,

4805
02:30:12,950 --> 02:30:17,210
I've got a few people together and I
started the doc that was foundation to 22

4806
02:30:17,211 --> 02:30:18,044
years ago.

4807
02:30:18,920 --> 02:30:19,251
And,

4808
02:30:19,251 --> 02:30:20,084
uh,

4809
02:30:20,270 --> 02:30:22,010
we've grown quite a bit,

4810
02:30:22,011 --> 02:30:24,440
but just a little grassroots thing,

4811
02:30:24,470 --> 02:30:25,430
but it's grown.

4812
02:30:26,020 --> 02:30:26,853
Um,

4813
02:30:27,080 --> 02:30:28,100
we probably give away,

4814
02:30:28,101 --> 02:30:28,934
uh,

4815
02:30:29,290 --> 02:30:30,200
and real help.

4816
02:30:31,100 --> 02:30:35,330
We have one paid person and
one office has 1400 a month.

4817
02:30:35,810 --> 02:30:36,590
That's it.

4818
02:30:36,590 --> 02:30:37,160
Um,

4819
02:30:37,160 --> 02:30:39,470
so no administrative
costs other than nose.

4820
02:30:40,760 --> 02:30:41,593
And um,

4821
02:30:41,840 --> 02:30:42,673
that's it.

4822
02:30:43,040 --> 02:30:48,040
Nobody gets salaries to start one person
and all the money goes to the cases and

4823
02:30:49,671 --> 02:30:50,504
uh,

4824
02:30:50,720 --> 02:30:51,800
we probably give away.

4825
02:30:56,030 --> 02:30:56,863
Yeah.

4826
02:30:57,310 --> 02:30:58,480
600,000,

4827
02:30:58,481 --> 02:30:59,710
700,000 a year.

4828
02:31:00,100 --> 02:31:00,610
Um,

4829
02:31:00,610 --> 02:31:01,540
but direct help,

4830
02:31:02,020 --> 02:31:02,441
um,

4831
02:31:02,441 --> 02:31:03,274
we don't,

4832
02:31:03,370 --> 02:31:04,330
we don't give to the,

4833
02:31:04,331 --> 02:31:05,164
you know,

4834
02:31:05,410 --> 02:31:06,940
we don't give to march of dimes.

4835
02:31:06,941 --> 02:31:07,990
We don't give it to them.

4836
02:31:07,991 --> 02:31:11,590
We don't give it to
patients getting Red Cross.

4837
02:31:11,740 --> 02:31:12,640
We give it directly.

4838
02:31:12,641 --> 02:31:12,900
We've,

4839
02:31:12,900 --> 02:31:13,420
we,

4840
02:31:13,420 --> 02:31:17,650
they come to us now because we were
out there to an extent where people all

4841
02:31:17,651 --> 02:31:17,891
know,

4842
02:31:17,891 --> 02:31:18,810
but they,

4843
02:31:19,050 --> 02:31:19,950
they come to us,

4844
02:31:20,850 --> 02:31:22,710
they have a kid with cerebral palsy,

4845
02:31:22,711 --> 02:31:23,670
needs a certain bike,

4846
02:31:23,671 --> 02:31:25,020
the bike cause $1,500,

4847
02:31:25,021 --> 02:31:25,440
bang,

4848
02:31:25,440 --> 02:31:25,950
boom,

4849
02:31:25,950 --> 02:31:26,783
got the bike.

4850
02:31:26,950 --> 02:31:27,870
We got another way.

4851
02:31:27,871 --> 02:31:30,840
It needs a machine that
circulates the blood in his legs.

4852
02:31:30,841 --> 02:31:31,111
Of course.

4853
02:31:31,111 --> 02:31:32,040
25 hour bang.

4854
02:31:32,041 --> 02:31:32,710
You got it.

4855
02:31:32,710 --> 02:31:33,240
Well,

4856
02:31:33,240 --> 02:31:34,170
obviously we,

4857
02:31:35,190 --> 02:31:36,630
we make sure it's legitimate.

4858
02:31:36,720 --> 02:31:37,860
We research it,

4859
02:31:37,920 --> 02:31:38,611
we do that.

4860
02:31:38,611 --> 02:31:39,444
We have a board.

4861
02:31:39,660 --> 02:31:44,010
We make sure drill we do do make sure
it really is real because you do get

4862
02:31:44,011 --> 02:31:45,330
people to take advantage a little bit,

4863
02:31:46,050 --> 02:31:46,883
but,

4864
02:31:47,660 --> 02:31:48,360
and we do it.

4865
02:31:48,360 --> 02:31:53,310
We act on it because my father never
made people feel less when they were poor

4866
02:31:53,580 --> 02:31:54,690
or when they needed something.

4867
02:31:55,110 --> 02:31:56,310
That was the greatest thing he did.

4868
02:31:56,311 --> 02:31:58,560
He never made them lose
more than they lost already.

4869
02:31:59,040 --> 02:31:59,873
Their integrity.

4870
02:31:59,940 --> 02:32:00,420
Never.

4871
02:32:00,420 --> 02:32:00,870
Never,

4872
02:32:00,870 --> 02:32:01,703
never.

4873
02:32:01,860 --> 02:32:03,480
He never made him feel he didn't show.

4874
02:32:03,760 --> 02:32:04,950
I remember one time,

4875
02:32:04,951 --> 02:32:07,470
it was Christmas Eve when it was
I hanging out and I was a kid.

4876
02:32:07,471 --> 02:32:08,250
I was in them.

4877
02:32:08,250 --> 02:32:11,220
I was at my father's office because
I want her to be with them and it was

4878
02:32:11,221 --> 02:32:14,550
Christmas eve and it was late and we
were still in the office and a woman,

4879
02:32:14,551 --> 02:32:16,050
I remember she was a Spanish woman.

4880
02:32:16,260 --> 02:32:16,801
She came in,

4881
02:32:16,801 --> 02:32:21,801
she has six kids and she was nervous
and I remember watching how nervous she

4882
02:32:22,321 --> 02:32:22,531
was.

4883
02:32:22,531 --> 02:32:23,364
I was like,

4884
02:32:23,370 --> 02:32:24,600
even though I was young was like,

4885
02:32:24,660 --> 02:32:27,480
she's really nervous and I found out,

4886
02:32:27,510 --> 02:32:28,890
I learned about human behavior.

4887
02:32:28,890 --> 02:32:33,450
I learned about what it was and
I'm watching her and sure enough,

4888
02:32:33,840 --> 02:32:36,570
she was getting ready when the
last kid got taken care of.

4889
02:32:36,780 --> 02:32:37,950
She was going to dot out of there.

4890
02:32:37,951 --> 02:32:40,200
She didn't have money and the poor woman,

4891
02:32:40,440 --> 02:32:41,280
she was she,

4892
02:32:41,700 --> 02:32:43,200
she had to take care of her kids.

4893
02:32:43,380 --> 02:32:44,580
She didn't want to do that,

4894
02:32:44,730 --> 02:32:49,080
but she was going to run out of there
cause she did not have money and he

4895
02:32:49,081 --> 02:32:52,140
recognized me take announced
I didn't know what it was.

4896
02:32:52,141 --> 02:32:53,850
So I'm not going to say
I thought I was smart,

4897
02:32:54,030 --> 02:32:55,350
but I recognize something.

4898
02:32:55,620 --> 02:32:56,550
All this motion,

4899
02:32:56,551 --> 02:32:57,540
all this nervousness,

4900
02:32:57,750 --> 02:32:58,800
it wasn't normal.

4901
02:32:59,310 --> 02:33:04,310
He recognized at all and before he got
to the last kid so he wouldn't embarrass

4902
02:33:05,221 --> 02:33:10,110
her so she wouldn't run out of there
and do that to itself and lose something

4903
02:33:10,111 --> 02:33:11,460
more than she lost already.

4904
02:33:12,780 --> 02:33:13,613
He said,

4905
02:33:13,770 --> 02:33:15,090
this one's on me

4906
02:33:16,680 --> 02:33:18,150
and the nervousness went away.

4907
02:33:18,270 --> 02:33:18,661
She said,

4908
02:33:18,661 --> 02:33:19,650
there's no charge today.

4909
02:33:19,890 --> 02:33:21,630
He said there's no charge today.

4910
02:33:22,770 --> 02:33:25,050
And I don't know if she spoke English,

4911
02:33:25,051 --> 02:33:29,580
but she understood it and he made her
understand it and there was no charge

4912
02:33:29,581 --> 02:33:30,390
today.

4913
02:33:30,390 --> 02:33:31,830
And soon as he said that,

4914
02:33:32,310 --> 02:33:33,390
everything changed.

4915
02:33:33,750 --> 02:33:34,830
Everything changed.

4916
02:33:34,831 --> 02:33:35,581
He wasn't nervous,

4917
02:33:35,581 --> 02:33:39,540
he wasn't looking at doors and she's,

4918
02:33:40,110 --> 02:33:40,943
she cried

4919
02:33:43,110 --> 02:33:46,080
and she left and when she left,

4920
02:33:46,200 --> 02:33:49,200
the place was packed
because that was his office.

4921
02:33:50,220 --> 02:33:52,460
And all of a sudden he's,

4922
02:33:52,880 --> 02:33:54,540
I've talked to himself a little bit,

4923
02:33:54,570 --> 02:33:54,871
just,

4924
02:33:54,871 --> 02:33:55,704
just for a second.

4925
02:33:55,710 --> 02:33:55,951
I mean,

4926
02:33:55,951 --> 02:33:56,890
he didn't do this on my,

4927
02:33:56,891 --> 02:33:57,600
you know,

4928
02:33:57,600 --> 02:33:58,830
but he just like said,

4929
02:33:58,940 --> 02:33:59,230
you know,

4930
02:33:59,230 --> 02:34:00,960
it wasn't like that,

4931
02:34:01,080 --> 02:34:01,291
you know,

4932
02:34:01,291 --> 02:34:02,124
I wasn't thinking,

4933
02:34:04,500 --> 02:34:05,430
of course he wasn't taking it.

4934
02:34:05,431 --> 02:34:06,750
He didn't know it was Christmas Eve.

4935
02:34:07,680 --> 02:34:10,170
So he turns to me and
he gives me a mission,

4936
02:34:10,171 --> 02:34:11,004
a job.

4937
02:34:11,220 --> 02:34:12,340
He opened the,

4938
02:34:12,550 --> 02:34:14,790
it takes hours and he gives me a $50 bill.

4939
02:34:15,390 --> 02:34:15,751
He says,

4940
02:34:15,751 --> 02:34:17,530
go find that she's probably on a bus stop.

4941
02:34:19,030 --> 02:34:22,350
I ran out that door like I like,

4942
02:34:22,380 --> 02:34:24,310
I was given the greatest
mission in the world.

4943
02:34:24,880 --> 02:34:27,820
High felt so proud I could,

4944
02:34:27,821 --> 02:34:28,840
I ran,

4945
02:34:28,841 --> 02:34:30,130
I knew where the bus stop was.

4946
02:34:30,610 --> 02:34:31,810
I was going to run all of them,

4947
02:34:32,410 --> 02:34:35,320
but she was at the first
one down on Bay street,

4948
02:34:36,520 --> 02:34:37,420
right around the corner,

4949
02:34:37,630 --> 02:34:39,010
down block,

4950
02:34:39,011 --> 02:34:39,844
two blocks.

4951
02:34:40,480 --> 02:34:41,200
And I,

4952
02:34:41,200 --> 02:34:42,033
she's there.

4953
02:34:42,370 --> 02:34:44,560
And sure enough days she has done a post.

4954
02:34:44,561 --> 02:34:45,191
I went up to,

4955
02:34:45,191 --> 02:34:46,024
I said,

4956
02:34:46,300 --> 02:34:50,110
the doctor said it gives
you this and you know,

4957
02:34:50,860 --> 02:34:51,940
she looked at it,

4958
02:34:51,941 --> 02:34:52,450
she,

4959
02:34:52,450 --> 02:34:52,751
you know,

4960
02:34:52,751 --> 02:34:53,584
she,

4961
02:34:54,190 --> 02:34:54,580
she,

4962
02:34:54,580 --> 02:34:54,880
you know,

4963
02:34:54,880 --> 02:34:55,713
she was shocked,

4964
02:34:56,380 --> 02:34:57,213
but she,

4965
02:34:57,580 --> 02:34:58,840
she started crying again.

4966
02:35:00,160 --> 02:35:03,880
But I felt so good because like
I felt like I was part of it,

4967
02:35:04,450 --> 02:35:05,283
you know.

4968
02:35:05,770 --> 02:35:06,281
And um,

4969
02:35:06,281 --> 02:35:09,100
so I started this foundation and I said,

4970
02:35:09,330 --> 02:35:09,550
you know,

4971
02:35:09,550 --> 02:35:10,383
I needed help.

4972
02:35:10,600 --> 02:35:10,961
I said,

4973
02:35:10,961 --> 02:35:11,794
look,

4974
02:35:12,910 --> 02:35:13,870
we're going to do what he did.

4975
02:35:14,350 --> 02:35:15,183
No red tape.

4976
02:35:15,790 --> 02:35:17,080
No losing your pride.

4977
02:35:18,580 --> 02:35:19,900
People that fall through the cracks.

4978
02:35:19,930 --> 02:35:20,741
That's my father.

4979
02:35:20,741 --> 02:35:21,101
He was,

4980
02:35:21,101 --> 02:35:21,400
he was,

4981
02:35:21,400 --> 02:35:22,600
he had a phd in that.

4982
02:35:23,320 --> 02:35:25,120
All the people that fell to the cracks,

4983
02:35:25,121 --> 02:35:26,080
he took care of more.

4984
02:35:26,830 --> 02:35:27,221
I said,

4985
02:35:27,221 --> 02:35:29,170
we're going to take care of the ones,

4986
02:35:29,171 --> 02:35:29,411
you know,

4987
02:35:29,411 --> 02:35:30,220
muscular dystrophy,

4988
02:35:30,220 --> 02:35:31,300
great organization.

4989
02:35:31,330 --> 02:35:32,410
But two people out there,

4990
02:35:32,411 --> 02:35:33,010
no,

4991
02:35:33,010 --> 02:35:33,731
not a bad way.

4992
02:35:33,731 --> 02:35:38,560
But did you know like 87% goes to
administrative costs and like 4% goes to

4993
02:35:38,561 --> 02:35:39,340
research.

4994
02:35:39,340 --> 02:35:41,110
These people don't need
research in their life.

4995
02:35:41,111 --> 02:35:41,891
They've told me that.

4996
02:35:41,891 --> 02:35:42,431
I know it,

4997
02:35:42,431 --> 02:35:43,264
I recognize it.

4998
02:35:43,360 --> 02:35:44,193
You know what they need.

4999
02:35:44,350 --> 02:35:45,370
They need a wheelchair.

5000
02:35:45,670 --> 02:35:47,490
You know they need a handicap ramp.

5001
02:35:47,491 --> 02:35:48,324
Do you know what they need?

5002
02:35:48,340 --> 02:35:49,870
They can't medication paid for.

5003
02:35:49,990 --> 02:35:50,411
You know what?

5004
02:35:50,411 --> 02:35:53,980
They need the utilities to be kept on
when they're being shut off because they

5005
02:35:53,981 --> 02:35:54,610
can't afford,

5006
02:35:54,610 --> 02:35:55,450
you know what they need.

5007
02:35:55,570 --> 02:35:58,750
They need the back rent paid because
someone got sick and one of the people

5008
02:35:58,751 --> 02:36:02,860
working there had to quit the job and
they were going to be put into a shelter

5009
02:36:02,861 --> 02:36:03,730
with six kids.

5010
02:36:04,570 --> 02:36:05,770
So we pay the back rent,

5011
02:36:05,920 --> 02:36:07,390
we paid the utility costs,

5012
02:36:07,540 --> 02:36:08,800
we pay the cancer Medicaid,

5013
02:36:08,890 --> 02:36:12,490
we put the wheelchair
ramp up and we do those.

5014
02:36:12,520 --> 02:36:16,660
That's what we do and I'm
researching part of their life.

5015
02:36:16,661 --> 02:36:17,290
It's great.

5016
02:36:17,290 --> 02:36:21,760
That's hopefully comes so we could close
all these places down and our close

5017
02:36:21,770 --> 02:36:22,660
mine down first,

5018
02:36:23,560 --> 02:36:26,620
but right now they don't need research.

5019
02:36:26,621 --> 02:36:27,820
They need that.

5020
02:36:28,390 --> 02:36:30,970
They need help for their way of life.

5021
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:34,540
Now for the quality of
life for that kid now.

5022
02:36:35,290 --> 02:36:36,280
So that's what we do.

5023
02:36:36,460 --> 02:36:38,440
How could someone donate
to this if they want to?

5024
02:36:38,920 --> 02:36:40,360
It's the dark that was said.

5025
02:36:40,361 --> 02:36:42,310
I'm real bad on a website.

5026
02:36:42,311 --> 02:36:43,690
Stuff on wake up caveman.

5027
02:36:43,690 --> 02:36:45,050
But it's the doctor.

5028
02:36:45,060 --> 02:36:47,770
Atlas Foundation W.

That's it.

5039
02:37:02,320 --> 02:37:03,153
There it is.

5040
02:37:03,420 --> 02:37:04,061
All right.

5041
02:37:04,061 --> 02:37:04,894
We got it up there.

5042
02:37:05,170 --> 02:37:10,170
One time with the phone number is
(718) 980-7037 (718) 980-7037 and um,

5043
02:37:13,190 --> 02:37:16,730

02:37:16,731 --> 02:37:17,040

There we go there and donate.

5046
02:37:19,640 --> 02:37:20,473
I'm sold.

5047
02:37:20,660 --> 02:37:21,470
Thank you.

5048
02:37:21,470 --> 02:37:21,651
Yeah.

5049
02:37:21,651 --> 02:37:23,060
This is a beautiful conversation,

5050
02:37:23,061 --> 02:37:23,510
man.

5051
02:37:23,510 --> 02:37:24,920
And not just about boxing.

5052
02:37:25,520 --> 02:37:26,353
And uh,

5053
02:37:27,080 --> 02:37:29,180
I think this,

5054
02:37:29,181 --> 02:37:29,280
uh,

5055
02:37:29,280 --> 02:37:30,040
this,

5056
02:37:30,040 --> 02:37:30,760
like I said,

5057
02:37:30,760 --> 02:37:33,010
it speaks so much to
who you are and why you,

5058
02:37:33,030 --> 02:37:36,050
who you are and why you
won't tolerate any bullshit.

5059
02:37:36,770 --> 02:37:37,131
Yeah.

5060
02:37:37,131 --> 02:37:39,290
It's like when you've
seen a guy like that,

5061
02:37:39,291 --> 02:37:42,140
it's Kinda make sense.

5062
02:37:42,470 --> 02:37:44,330
Are you still working with fighters?

5063
02:37:44,660 --> 02:37:45,051
You know,

5064
02:37:45,051 --> 02:37:45,620
it's funny.

5065
02:37:45,620 --> 02:37:46,100
Um,

5066
02:37:46,100 --> 02:37:50,030
no was the word and to a few
minutes ago to a few minutes ago,

5067
02:37:50,190 --> 02:37:51,260
I'm saying a few minutes,

5068
02:37:51,261 --> 02:37:52,580
but until a week ago,

5069
02:37:52,790 --> 02:37:53,421
maybe less,

5070
02:37:53,421 --> 02:37:54,410
maybe five days ago,

5071
02:37:54,411 --> 02:37:54,800
I've,

5072
02:37:54,800 --> 02:37:56,600
I've decided to train a fighter.

5073
02:37:57,140 --> 02:38:00,890
He's going to fight for the world
light heavyweight title to sample first

5074
02:38:01,250 --> 02:38:03,410
against the second
hardest puncher in boxing.

5075
02:38:03,411 --> 02:38:04,190
Unfortunately,

5076
02:38:04,190 --> 02:38:05,870
when she wasn't and um,

5077
02:38:06,440 --> 02:38:06,951
it's gonna be,

5078
02:38:06,951 --> 02:38:08,240
I think it's on showtime,

5079
02:38:08,720 --> 02:38:09,291
I think.

5080
02:38:09,291 --> 02:38:12,080
I don't even know because I didn't even
find those details out when they asked

5081
02:38:12,081 --> 02:38:14,360
me to train them first I was saying no,

5082
02:38:14,900 --> 02:38:15,920
and then my kids said,

5083
02:38:16,760 --> 02:38:17,593
dad,

5084
02:38:17,600 --> 02:38:19,040
at least give it a chance.

5085
02:38:19,430 --> 02:38:22,760
So I flew out to where he is in Oxnard,

5086
02:38:22,761 --> 02:38:24,050
California to meet him.

5087
02:38:24,380 --> 02:38:26,360
His name is Alexander.

5088
02:38:26,510 --> 02:38:27,140
He's a,

5089
02:38:27,140 --> 02:38:30,550
he's a Ukrainian Alexander Wasik.

5090
02:38:30,590 --> 02:38:32,540
I learned that you don't pronounce the G,

5091
02:38:33,200 --> 02:38:33,920
it's voltage,

5092
02:38:33,920 --> 02:38:34,970
but it starts with a g.

5093
02:38:35,270 --> 02:38:36,230
He's 15 year old,

5094
02:38:36,231 --> 02:38:37,011
12 nine galleys,

5095
02:38:37,011 --> 02:38:41,420
finding the second hardest puncher in
boxing or donors to Stevenson in Montreal

5096
02:38:41,421 --> 02:38:42,900
where you call it.

5097
02:38:43,460 --> 02:38:44,330
It's a tough fight.

5098
02:38:44,570 --> 02:38:45,403
Um,

5099
02:38:45,560 --> 02:38:47,300
they asked me if I would
train them at first.

5100
02:38:47,300 --> 02:38:47,781
Like I said,

5101
02:38:47,781 --> 02:38:50,120
I would say no 20 things the
hardest punch your inbox.

5102
02:38:50,390 --> 02:38:51,223
Wilder,

5103
02:38:51,450 --> 02:38:52,283
wilder,

5104
02:38:52,700 --> 02:38:56,660
the old times would say he hit you on
top of the head and fractured ankles.

5105
02:38:58,490 --> 02:38:59,323
That's hard.

5106
02:39:00,650 --> 02:39:00,981
And,

5107
02:39:00,981 --> 02:39:01,400
um,

5108
02:39:01,400 --> 02:39:03,240
Donna Stevenson is a hell of a puncher,

5109
02:39:03,280 --> 02:39:04,910
is the second hardest puncher in boxing,

5110
02:39:04,911 --> 02:39:06,620
lefthand southpaw on top of it.

5111
02:39:07,130 --> 02:39:07,963
And um,

5112
02:39:08,390 --> 02:39:09,380
when I flew out talks,

5113
02:39:09,381 --> 02:39:10,121
not to two nights,

5114
02:39:10,121 --> 02:39:10,241
it,

5115
02:39:10,241 --> 02:39:13,040
if I'm going to say I'm
either going to say no,

5116
02:39:13,041 --> 02:39:14,660
which my kids asked me not to.

5117
02:39:14,960 --> 02:39:15,411
So I said,

5118
02:39:15,411 --> 02:39:19,250
then I'll get a fly out and I got to meet
him and when we had lunch with him and

5119
02:39:19,251 --> 02:39:20,084
the manager to,

5120
02:39:20,300 --> 02:39:21,050
you know,

5121
02:39:21,050 --> 02:39:21,710
anyway,

5122
02:39:21,710 --> 02:39:22,910
I'm sitting with them.

5123
02:39:22,911 --> 02:39:24,500
I don't know what they are for sure.

5124
02:39:24,580 --> 02:39:24,860
You know,

5125
02:39:24,860 --> 02:39:26,690
the manager I knew for
a while in a business,

5126
02:39:26,691 --> 02:39:28,520
but for sure you don't know to,

5127
02:39:28,521 --> 02:39:29,354
you know,

5128
02:39:29,360 --> 02:39:30,193
and um,

5129
02:39:30,350 --> 02:39:31,580
I wanted to try to find out.

5130
02:39:31,910 --> 02:39:34,010
So the thinking was like,

5131
02:39:34,580 --> 02:39:34,851
you know,

5132
02:39:34,851 --> 02:39:36,080
you're here to find out things.

5133
02:39:36,081 --> 02:39:39,140
Probably tomorrow in the
gym and post we watch tape.

5134
02:39:39,590 --> 02:39:40,700
So those are the things.

5135
02:39:40,701 --> 02:39:41,000
But,

5136
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:42,140
so I said to him right out,

5137
02:39:42,141 --> 02:39:42,411
I said,

5138
02:39:42,411 --> 02:39:43,190
well,

5139
02:39:43,190 --> 02:39:45,860
I'm here to see one thing first.

5140
02:39:47,510 --> 02:39:48,890
If you're a decent person.

5141
02:39:49,970 --> 02:39:50,631
And they were,

5142
02:39:50,631 --> 02:39:50,931
you know,

5143
02:39:50,931 --> 02:39:51,764
they were like,

5144
02:39:52,520 --> 02:39:53,353
that sounds,

5145
02:39:53,360 --> 02:39:53,631
you know,

5146
02:39:53,631 --> 02:39:54,350
maybe different,

5147
02:39:54,350 --> 02:39:54,621
you know,

5148
02:39:54,621 --> 02:39:55,840
because you know.

5149
02:39:55,870 --> 02:39:56,620
But I said,

5150
02:39:56,620 --> 02:39:59,300
I just want to have your decent perfect
cause I don't want to be around bear

5151
02:39:59,301 --> 02:40:00,134
people.

5152
02:40:00,290 --> 02:40:03,260
I just want to be around and
there's bad people out there.

5153
02:40:03,320 --> 02:40:04,430
I'm sure it's the way it is,

5154
02:40:04,640 --> 02:40:07,610
but I don't want to be around bear people.

5155
02:40:08,030 --> 02:40:08,810
I never did.

5156
02:40:08,810 --> 02:40:10,520
But now I definitely don't.

5157
02:40:11,080 --> 02:40:11,810
I want to be,

5158
02:40:11,810 --> 02:40:13,220
if I'm going to spend two months,

5159
02:40:13,440 --> 02:40:15,060
it's not easy in camp.

5160
02:40:15,390 --> 02:40:16,470
I want to be around someone.

5161
02:40:16,471 --> 02:40:17,790
I feel good about being around.

5162
02:40:18,480 --> 02:40:21,150
And so that's the first thing.

5163
02:40:21,151 --> 02:40:22,830
The second thing is too,

5164
02:40:22,831 --> 02:40:23,820
I think I can help them.

5165
02:40:24,120 --> 02:40:25,140
That was the second thing.

5166
02:40:25,810 --> 02:40:26,643
Yeah.

5167
02:40:26,760 --> 02:40:27,900
And Kenny be helped.

5168
02:40:28,020 --> 02:40:30,540
So when you go to talk
to someone like that,

5169
02:40:30,541 --> 02:40:31,510
do you watch a move?

5170
02:40:31,530 --> 02:40:33,000
What he'd seen his family,

5171
02:40:33,001 --> 02:40:33,641
first thing I did,

5172
02:40:33,641 --> 02:40:35,310
I want to wind up meeting his family.

5173
02:40:35,311 --> 02:40:38,070
He's got three young
kids and he's a husband.

5174
02:40:38,071 --> 02:40:38,970
And of course,

5175
02:40:38,971 --> 02:40:41,550
and I see a decent person.

5176
02:40:42,540 --> 02:40:45,720
And then now my watch film and um,

5177
02:40:46,200 --> 02:40:50,850
I see a guy that has ideas
that need to be added to that.

5178
02:40:50,970 --> 02:40:51,980
I think that's the best word.

5179
02:40:52,770 --> 02:40:55,110
They've got good ideas technically,

5180
02:40:55,440 --> 02:40:56,850
but they need to be advanced.

5181
02:40:57,210 --> 02:40:59,160
They need to be added too polished,

5182
02:40:59,161 --> 02:40:59,641
polished,

5183
02:40:59,641 --> 02:41:00,110
edited.

5184
02:41:00,110 --> 02:41:00,630
Yes.

5185
02:41:00,630 --> 02:41:01,463
And uh,

5186
02:41:01,790 --> 02:41:02,940
taking down the road a little bit.

5187
02:41:03,420 --> 02:41:04,253
And um,

5188
02:41:05,280 --> 02:41:07,050
I see a guy who behaves like a fighter.

5189
02:41:07,620 --> 02:41:09,240
That's where it starts for me.

5190
02:41:09,510 --> 02:41:10,830
Besides being a decent person,

5191
02:41:11,130 --> 02:41:12,180
he behaves like a fighter.

5192
02:41:12,181 --> 02:41:13,014
He got hurt.

5193
02:41:13,140 --> 02:41:15,180
He got dropped in a fiery
behave like a fighter.

5194
02:41:15,960 --> 02:41:18,240
You have to be able to a
fighter to be a fighter,

5195
02:41:18,241 --> 02:41:19,530
you have to be a fighter.

5196
02:41:19,620 --> 02:41:20,220
Right.

5197
02:41:20,220 --> 02:41:20,611
And,

5198
02:41:20,611 --> 02:41:21,444
um,

5199
02:41:21,660 --> 02:41:22,950
well you would know that better than most.

5200
02:41:22,951 --> 02:41:24,030
So he,

5201
02:41:24,031 --> 02:41:24,864
um,

5202
02:41:26,870 --> 02:41:27,301
and,

5203
02:41:27,301 --> 02:41:28,830
and there's one problem.

5204
02:41:29,850 --> 02:41:32,580
Every fight he gets hit at
least once really clean.

5205
02:41:32,730 --> 02:41:34,140
You can't do that with this guy.

5206
02:41:34,280 --> 02:41:34,980
Right.

5207
02:41:34,980 --> 02:41:36,090
He gets it more than once,

5208
02:41:36,240 --> 02:41:37,320
but he gets it clean.

5209
02:41:37,950 --> 02:41:38,740
You know,

5210
02:41:38,740 --> 02:41:39,400
I,

5211
02:41:39,400 --> 02:41:42,660
one time I used to fight him when I
was trying to Bradley actually was,

5212
02:41:42,930 --> 02:41:43,530
I said,

5213
02:41:43,530 --> 02:41:44,550
you religious.

5214
02:41:44,580 --> 02:41:45,120
Yeah,

5215
02:41:45,120 --> 02:41:45,571
I am.

5216
02:41:45,571 --> 02:41:46,291
And my own way.

5217
02:41:46,291 --> 02:41:46,591
I said,

5218
02:41:46,591 --> 02:41:46,921
listen,

5219
02:41:46,921 --> 02:41:47,790
I'm not into that.

5220
02:41:47,820 --> 02:41:48,540
I'm say,

5221
02:41:48,540 --> 02:41:50,220
I'm just using it as an example,

5222
02:41:50,400 --> 02:41:51,233
my way of saying,

5223
02:41:51,420 --> 02:41:52,800
I said I was brought up a Catholic,

5224
02:41:52,801 --> 02:41:54,600
I forget half the things they told me,

5225
02:41:54,930 --> 02:41:59,240
but I remember about
they'd use to teach you've,

5226
02:41:59,760 --> 02:42:02,010
I'm probably pronouncing her when
I'm going to need your help again,

5227
02:42:02,190 --> 02:42:07,190
but venial sins and mortal since the renew
or the little ones you can live with,

5228
02:42:07,570 --> 02:42:10,650
you don't go and see the guy
that's read the mortal ones.

5229
02:42:10,650 --> 02:42:11,483
You've got a problem.

5230
02:42:12,240 --> 02:42:12,990
I said,

5231
02:42:12,990 --> 02:42:15,110
the way you box you've,

5232
02:42:15,560 --> 02:42:17,130
you make it moral sense,

5233
02:42:17,610 --> 02:42:20,010
it the venial sins domain crap,

5234
02:42:20,130 --> 02:42:20,380
right?

5235
02:42:20,380 --> 02:42:21,960
But you're make it more than
once you're getting a hit,

5236
02:42:21,961 --> 02:42:22,794
clean,

5237
02:42:23,540 --> 02:42:24,373
unblocked,

5238
02:42:25,110 --> 02:42:25,980
clean,

5239
02:42:26,010 --> 02:42:28,620
solid punches that sometimes
you don't even see.

5240
02:42:28,650 --> 02:42:29,720
Like the providing the crop,

5241
02:42:29,760 --> 02:42:29,960
right?

5242
02:42:29,960 --> 02:42:30,390
Yes,

5243
02:42:30,390 --> 02:42:30,900
yes,

5244
02:42:30,900 --> 02:42:31,231
yes,

5245
02:42:31,231 --> 02:42:31,920
yes.

5246
02:42:31,920 --> 02:42:33,810
So I said that's going to be corrected,

5247
02:42:33,900 --> 02:42:34,410
right?

5248
02:42:34,410 --> 02:42:35,290
So we corrected.

5249
02:42:35,490 --> 02:42:37,110
So how do you correct something like that.

5250
02:42:37,200 --> 02:42:38,160
You know what it is,

5251
02:42:38,300 --> 02:42:38,760
right?

5252
02:42:38,760 --> 02:42:39,720
You have to know what it is.

5253
02:42:39,721 --> 02:42:41,160
You have to see why he's getting hit.

5254
02:42:41,450 --> 02:42:42,540
But you gotta change.

5255
02:42:42,630 --> 02:42:44,410
You gotta change the technique of way

5256
02:42:46,110 --> 02:42:46,920
everything.

5257
02:42:46,920 --> 02:42:47,701
There's rules.

5258
02:42:47,701 --> 02:42:49,110
You got to it's life.

5259
02:42:49,170 --> 02:42:50,240
It's when you work with a garlic,

5260
02:42:50,310 --> 02:42:51,510
then you only have two months.

5261
02:42:51,540 --> 02:42:53,320
How much change can you
affect in two months?

5262
02:42:53,550 --> 02:42:58,230
I worked with Bradley for the right wheels
fight and he and he couldn't stand in

5263
02:42:58,231 --> 02:43:01,170
front of the guy and he went out and
he moved around the guy and you know we

5264
02:43:01,171 --> 02:43:01,351
were,

5265
02:43:01,351 --> 02:43:02,250
we were fortunate.

5266
02:43:02,730 --> 02:43:03,563
We did okay.

5267
02:43:03,630 --> 02:43:04,500
We made some change,

5268
02:43:05,280 --> 02:43:07,410
but I mean little things like,

5269
02:43:07,411 --> 02:43:08,250
I'll give you an example.

5270
02:43:08,550 --> 02:43:09,001
Rules,

5271
02:43:09,001 --> 02:43:09,421
rules,

5272
02:43:09,421 --> 02:43:09,751
rules,

5273
02:43:09,751 --> 02:43:11,920
simple things like where
do you 12 punch from?

5274
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:12,501
I know.

5275
02:43:12,501 --> 02:43:13,120
I just,

5276
02:43:13,120 --> 02:43:13,953
yeah,

5277
02:43:14,190 --> 02:43:15,340
I 12 I know.

5278
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:19,150
Don't throw jab from there because if
you're too close he could time you were

5279
02:43:19,151 --> 02:43:20,490
right hand and we weren't heard.

5280
02:43:20,500 --> 02:43:21,880
Jabbers to beginning of things.

5281
02:43:21,881 --> 02:43:23,170
Jack has to the,

5282
02:43:23,171 --> 02:43:23,740
you know,

5283
02:43:23,740 --> 02:43:24,910
it leads to good things.

5284
02:43:25,030 --> 02:43:25,870
It's a great point.

5285
02:43:25,900 --> 02:43:26,111
Yeah,

5286
02:43:26,111 --> 02:43:26,680
it is.

5287
02:43:26,680 --> 02:43:30,250
It's a terrible punch and so it's
a horrible punch of your throat.

5288
02:43:30,251 --> 02:43:31,084
The wrong distance.

5289
02:43:31,210 --> 02:43:32,530
You drove from a little too close.

5290
02:43:32,550 --> 02:43:33,040
Bang.

5291
02:43:33,040 --> 02:43:35,530
You get who we're right in no way.

5292
02:43:35,650 --> 02:43:38,710
You throw punches from love
talking to all he got here.

5293
02:43:38,711 --> 02:43:40,570
We're right here and we'll
provide the god he didn't.

5294
02:43:40,660 --> 02:43:42,010
All he knew was he got hit,

5295
02:43:42,250 --> 02:43:45,280
but he didn't know why you
through the lab took in front,

5296
02:43:45,520 --> 02:43:46,600
right hand is there.

5297
02:43:46,690 --> 02:43:47,523
Boom.

5298
02:43:47,710 --> 02:43:48,910
Get on a side,

5299
02:43:49,030 --> 02:43:51,220
troll punches from certain positions,

5300
02:43:51,400 --> 02:43:54,220
not allowed to draw punches are less.

5301
02:43:54,221 --> 02:43:55,990
They're from the right position

5302
02:43:57,650 --> 02:44:01,640
now you have to cause
would tell me you have to

5303
02:44:01,980 --> 02:44:06,710
coal over and over and over and over word

5304
02:44:06,720 --> 02:44:09,840
again til they can't do it
wrong if they want it to.

5305
02:44:11,030 --> 02:44:11,940
It's got to become a habit.

5306
02:44:12,120 --> 02:44:12,271
Right?

5307
02:44:12,271 --> 02:44:15,780
But you're not thinking about it where
it's a habit and that takes a lot of work

5308
02:44:15,781 --> 02:44:17,400
and that takes understanding what it is.

5309
02:44:17,910 --> 02:44:18,840
And it takes a lot of work.

5310
02:44:18,841 --> 02:44:19,860
You've got to be on him every time.

5311
02:44:19,920 --> 02:44:21,060
And it takes a guy,

5312
02:44:21,360 --> 02:44:23,070
they can put his ego in a pocket.

5313
02:44:23,490 --> 02:44:24,241
It's why you want to know,

5314
02:44:24,241 --> 02:44:25,290
do I have a good guy here?

5315
02:44:25,560 --> 02:44:26,490
Do I have a decent guy?

5316
02:44:26,880 --> 02:44:30,090
Because you're telling a guy who's
already made it to a certain level without

5317
02:44:30,091 --> 02:44:30,510
you.

5318
02:44:30,510 --> 02:44:31,343
He has,

5319
02:44:32,430 --> 02:44:35,370
and now you're telling them
this things that he don't know.

5320
02:44:36,240 --> 02:44:39,120
So he's gotta be willing
to be able to accept that.

5321
02:44:40,110 --> 02:44:40,943
And I'm

5322
02:44:42,480 --> 02:44:46,920
one of the things I like people that
are unselfish and look all selfish to a

5323
02:44:46,921 --> 02:44:47,754
certain degree.

5324
02:44:47,850 --> 02:44:48,301
But again,

5325
02:44:48,301 --> 02:44:48,900
it's degrees.

5326
02:44:48,900 --> 02:44:50,370
How tough are you degrees?

5327
02:44:50,850 --> 02:44:51,480
All fighters,

5328
02:44:51,480 --> 02:44:52,500
a tough degrees.

5329
02:44:52,501 --> 02:44:53,190
How does,

5330
02:44:53,190 --> 02:44:54,930
how selfish are you degrees?

5331
02:44:56,010 --> 02:44:56,843
And

5332
02:44:59,730 --> 02:45:02,700
the whole understanding was I
would go to Oxnard for eight weeks,

5333
02:45:02,701 --> 02:45:03,330
you know,

5334
02:45:03,330 --> 02:45:04,163
to train them,

5335
02:45:04,650 --> 02:45:06,450
but maybe I don't want to go to oxide,

5336
02:45:07,050 --> 02:45:10,080
but I'll go wherever I
take it gives to fight it.

5337
02:45:10,081 --> 02:45:12,690
The best chance to win the weather,

5338
02:45:13,400 --> 02:45:14,280
the time zone.

5339
02:45:14,790 --> 02:45:16,800
But the main thing why I go there,

5340
02:45:17,700 --> 02:45:18,930
he's got three young kids.

5341
02:45:19,930 --> 02:45:21,420
I'm not in the rocky movie.

5342
02:45:22,310 --> 02:45:26,490
I don't want to take them away from
those kids for those eight weeks.

5343
02:45:26,700 --> 02:45:27,120
Right.

5344
02:45:27,120 --> 02:45:27,953
That's not good.

5345
02:45:28,230 --> 02:45:29,460
So how many,

5346
02:45:29,610 --> 02:45:31,890
so I took two weeks to decide to them.

5347
02:45:31,980 --> 02:45:33,330
He kept calling to manage up.

5348
02:45:33,990 --> 02:45:34,823
He's a good kid.

5349
02:45:36,120 --> 02:45:36,953
He is.

5350
02:45:37,320 --> 02:45:38,121
And he kept calling them,

5351
02:45:38,121 --> 02:45:38,951
manage up and saying,

5352
02:45:38,951 --> 02:45:39,784
did you hear yet?

5353
02:45:40,620 --> 02:45:42,150
And of course he had,

5354
02:45:42,660 --> 02:45:45,610
so he's thinking like
a good person or like,

5355
02:45:45,840 --> 02:45:46,800
I shouldn't say good part.

5356
02:45:46,801 --> 02:45:48,990
He's taken like a person that
wants to get what he wants to get,

5357
02:45:49,140 --> 02:45:50,400
but at the same time,

5358
02:45:50,940 --> 02:45:52,290
here's where the good part comes in,

5359
02:45:52,291 --> 02:45:53,730
or the self less pot.

5360
02:45:54,660 --> 02:45:55,493
He says,

5361
02:45:56,760 --> 02:45:57,990
if I have to go to New York,

5362
02:45:58,020 --> 02:45:59,010
I'll go to New York.

5363
02:45:59,730 --> 02:46:00,960
A lot of fighters don't do that.

5364
02:46:01,350 --> 02:46:02,071
They want help,

5365
02:46:02,071 --> 02:46:03,330
but they want it on their terms.

5366
02:46:03,390 --> 02:46:04,200
Right.

5367
02:46:04,200 --> 02:46:04,501
He said,

5368
02:46:04,501 --> 02:46:05,520
if I have to go to New York,

5369
02:46:05,521 --> 02:46:06,311
I go to New York.

5370
02:46:06,311 --> 02:46:07,410
If I have to go to Montreal,

5371
02:46:07,411 --> 02:46:07,651
Canada,

5372
02:46:07,651 --> 02:46:08,160
Montreal,

5373
02:46:08,160 --> 02:46:09,060
please tell them that,

5374
02:46:09,580 --> 02:46:10,030
that,

5375
02:46:10,030 --> 02:46:11,270
that spoke to me,

5376
02:46:12,170 --> 02:46:13,190
that I had this kid,

5377
02:46:13,730 --> 02:46:16,100
that selfless too to that extent.

5378
02:46:16,160 --> 02:46:17,690
And I could see was training him before.

5379
02:46:17,780 --> 02:46:18,500
Um,

5380
02:46:18,500 --> 02:46:19,400
I don't know the name,

5381
02:46:19,430 --> 02:46:20,420
but it was a

5382
02:46:22,450 --> 02:46:22,970
decent guy.

5383
02:46:22,970 --> 02:46:23,810
He's 15 at all.

5384
02:46:24,470 --> 02:46:24,900
But uh,

5385
02:46:24,900 --> 02:46:27,380
but he felt like when,

5386
02:46:27,830 --> 02:46:28,640
you know,

5387
02:46:28,640 --> 02:46:32,570
when he got dropped in a fight and
we went back to the gym immediately,

5388
02:46:32,571 --> 02:46:34,520
that should be dealt with,

5389
02:46:34,550 --> 02:46:35,383
you know,

5390
02:46:35,710 --> 02:46:37,790
but it was back to just basic training.

5391
02:46:37,791 --> 02:46:38,121
I can,

5392
02:46:38,121 --> 02:46:39,560
rather than that specific,

5393
02:46:39,830 --> 02:46:40,510
you know,

5394
02:46:40,510 --> 02:46:42,080
it doesn't mean that the guy's not good.

5395
02:46:42,081 --> 02:46:43,610
Doesn't mean it just that

5396
02:46:45,440 --> 02:46:46,550
everyone deals with things.

5397
02:46:46,551 --> 02:46:47,000
Definitely.

5398
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:47,600
That's all.

5399
02:46:47,600 --> 02:46:49,310
I mean it doesn't make me this or that,

5400
02:46:49,580 --> 02:46:52,040
but I just can do it the way I do it.

5401
02:46:52,190 --> 02:46:53,090
And I do it.

5402
02:46:53,091 --> 02:46:53,811
I look at film,

5403
02:46:53,811 --> 02:46:54,740
when I went to see him,

5404
02:46:54,741 --> 02:46:59,210
I had a couple of pages
written out already on things
I saw on film that he does

5405
02:46:59,211 --> 02:47:01,580
well that daddy would have to correct.

5406
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:06,260
And the one thing that he has to correct
for this fight will be good if you

5407
02:47:06,261 --> 02:47:06,771
don't get hit,

5408
02:47:06,771 --> 02:47:08,150
I mean that'd be a damn good thing.

5409
02:47:08,450 --> 02:47:13,450
But the one really thing is you can't
keep coming back in front of the guy at a

5410
02:47:13,581 --> 02:47:16,520
certain distance giving them a shot
at you when he can punch like that.

5411
02:47:16,880 --> 02:47:21,880
And that's one thing he always winds up
localized right back in front of the guy

5412
02:47:23,180 --> 02:47:25,460
and there's gotta be other options,

5413
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:27,230
other places to go.

5414
02:47:28,160 --> 02:47:28,993
You know,

5415
02:47:29,060 --> 02:47:29,871
I joke around,

5416
02:47:29,871 --> 02:47:31,250
I used to fund,

5417
02:47:31,640 --> 02:47:32,001
you know,

5418
02:47:32,001 --> 02:47:34,400
different examples of different analogies.

5419
02:47:34,401 --> 02:47:34,701
I say,

5420
02:47:34,701 --> 02:47:35,534
listen,

5421
02:47:35,780 --> 02:47:36,660
whether you had a mother,

5422
02:47:36,690 --> 02:47:40,730
grandmother and had somebody when you
were growing up told you don't hang out on

5423
02:47:40,731 --> 02:47:41,564
the corner.

5424
02:47:44,420 --> 02:47:44,870
Right?

5425
02:47:44,870 --> 02:47:45,231
Right.

5426
02:47:45,231 --> 02:47:45,620
Yeah.

5427
02:47:45,620 --> 02:47:46,280
Why?

5428
02:47:46,280 --> 02:47:47,750
Because nothing good can happen.

5429
02:47:48,860 --> 02:47:49,011
Well,

5430
02:47:49,011 --> 02:47:50,510
don't hang out in front of the guy.

5431
02:47:50,890 --> 02:47:52,610
Not the good can happen or can happen.

5432
02:47:52,670 --> 02:47:53,990
So we go from there.

5433
02:47:54,080 --> 02:47:54,321
You know,

5434
02:47:54,321 --> 02:47:55,270
it's a lot more to it.

5435
02:47:55,820 --> 02:47:56,061
Yeah,

5436
02:47:56,061 --> 02:47:56,481
he does.

5437
02:47:56,481 --> 02:47:57,201
He's a smart guy.

5438
02:47:57,201 --> 02:47:58,310
He's got a beautiful family.

5439
02:47:58,311 --> 02:47:59,720
And like I said,

5440
02:47:59,721 --> 02:48:00,480
it's a,

5441
02:48:00,480 --> 02:48:01,520
I'm so when do you start?

5442
02:48:01,521 --> 02:48:04,670
Because December 1st
December 1st horses to fight,

5443
02:48:04,671 --> 02:48:05,920
I have to make a decision.

5444
02:48:06,290 --> 02:48:06,980
I have to,

5445
02:48:06,980 --> 02:48:09,560
it's either going to be an
eight or a seven week camp.

5446
02:48:10,010 --> 02:48:10,630
Uh,

5447
02:48:10,630 --> 02:48:11,180
I,

5448
02:48:11,180 --> 02:48:12,170
I'm trying to feel,

5449
02:48:12,171 --> 02:48:14,180
I'm trying to find out
by asking them questions,

5450
02:48:14,510 --> 02:48:18,650
how quickly his body gets in shape because
I know it sounds funny to the average

5451
02:48:18,651 --> 02:48:19,221
guy out there,

5452
02:48:19,221 --> 02:48:20,990
but if it's a week too long,

5453
02:48:20,991 --> 02:48:21,680
it could be bad.

5454
02:48:21,680 --> 02:48:22,513
Yeah.

5455
02:48:23,010 --> 02:48:23,843
You know,

5456
02:48:23,900 --> 02:48:24,733
so,

5457
02:48:25,010 --> 02:48:26,480
and he's overtrained in his career.

5458
02:48:26,750 --> 02:48:29,420
So I wanted to try to try,

5459
02:48:29,630 --> 02:48:32,910
it's not an exact science
to have a feel for sure.

5460
02:48:32,920 --> 02:48:33,890
Be Age of seven weeks.

5461
02:48:33,891 --> 02:48:36,530
Did you monitor their heart
rate the rest of the world?

5462
02:48:36,650 --> 02:48:37,490
I have.

5463
02:48:37,520 --> 02:48:39,970
So we have that stuff
that we do that right.

5464
02:48:40,160 --> 02:48:40,521
Um,

5465
02:48:40,521 --> 02:48:43,000
to see if there were a ton of
pain when they wake up in the yes.

5466
02:48:43,100 --> 02:48:43,611
But you know what?

5467
02:48:43,611 --> 02:48:44,580
I depend on B.

5468
02:48:44,600 --> 02:48:47,320
I'm not going to stay and be asked you.

5469
02:48:47,960 --> 02:48:51,620
I depend on my eye more
than any three cm song down.

5470
02:48:52,070 --> 02:48:52,851
He seemed struggle.

5471
02:48:52,851 --> 02:48:54,710
And the trick is to not get there,

5472
02:48:55,100 --> 02:48:56,420
to try not to get there.

5473
02:48:57,440 --> 02:48:57,941
What are you doing?

5474
02:48:57,941 --> 02:48:58,940
You tell them to take a few days,

5475
02:48:59,270 --> 02:49:04,270
but I try to see it before I see what w
what I mean is if he had a hard day of

5476
02:49:04,491 --> 02:49:05,324
training,

5477
02:49:05,410 --> 02:49:08,250
I will just automatically
give him a light day or maybe

5478
02:49:08,250 --> 02:49:09,083
off the next day.

5479
02:49:09,360 --> 02:49:11,240
And like a lot of people
won't because they're afraid,

5480
02:49:11,340 --> 02:49:11,830
right?

5481
02:49:11,830 --> 02:49:12,570
You gotta work,

5482
02:49:12,570 --> 02:49:13,141
you gotta work.

5483
02:49:13,141 --> 02:49:13,610
Right.

5484
02:49:13,610 --> 02:49:13,990
And,

5485
02:49:13,990 --> 02:49:14,271
and,

5486
02:49:14,271 --> 02:49:15,960
but I learned not to be afraid of that.

5487
02:49:16,080 --> 02:49:16,870
Right.

5488
02:49:16,870 --> 02:49:19,530
So if I see he had a
real and he looked great,

5489
02:49:20,160 --> 02:49:20,680
you know what,

5490
02:49:20,680 --> 02:49:25,110
take off to wall or you sure take
off tomorrow so we don't get there.

5491
02:49:25,140 --> 02:49:25,800
Right.

5492
02:49:25,800 --> 02:49:29,320
To try to kind of like my
father like preventative.

5493
02:49:29,960 --> 02:49:31,890
I said this is a new
way of thinking though.

5494
02:49:31,891 --> 02:49:34,440
And it's such a smart way of thinking
because for the longest time,

5495
02:49:34,441 --> 02:49:35,790
everybody just wanted to be tough.

5496
02:49:35,880 --> 02:49:36,340
Yeah.

5497
02:49:36,340 --> 02:49:37,470
They just wanted to work harder.

5498
02:49:37,471 --> 02:49:38,580
But you got to work smarter.

5499
02:49:38,610 --> 02:49:38,761
Yeah,

5500
02:49:38,761 --> 02:49:39,594
you do.

5501
02:49:39,690 --> 02:49:40,410
Less is more,

5502
02:49:40,410 --> 02:49:41,190
you know that Sam,

5503
02:49:41,190 --> 02:49:41,371
but,

5504
02:49:41,371 --> 02:49:43,380
but sometimes it really is sometimes,

5505
02:49:43,381 --> 02:49:43,801
sometimes,

5506
02:49:43,801 --> 02:49:46,830
but sometimes not because some people
are fucking lazy and they're looking for

5507
02:49:46,831 --> 02:49:47,670
that easy way out.

5508
02:49:47,760 --> 02:49:49,590
You have to gauge that Jack to see it.

5509
02:49:49,591 --> 02:49:50,580
You have to know what you got to,

5510
02:49:50,790 --> 02:49:51,331
you know what I mean?

5511
02:49:51,331 --> 02:49:54,810
And sometimes the real discipline driven
guys are their own worst enemy in that

5512
02:49:54,811 --> 02:49:55,230
regard.

5513
02:49:55,230 --> 02:49:55,530
Yes.

5514
02:49:55,530 --> 02:49:56,430
Pushed too far.

5515
02:49:56,520 --> 02:49:56,970
Yes.

5516
02:49:56,970 --> 02:49:57,990
And this kid has been,

5517
02:49:58,200 --> 02:49:58,531
again,

5518
02:49:58,531 --> 02:49:59,940
I'm not here to say what was,

5519
02:50:00,150 --> 02:50:01,770
but the kid has been in that place.

5520
02:50:01,790 --> 02:50:02,370
Right.

5521
02:50:02,370 --> 02:50:03,750
And that's why they're coming to me.

5522
02:50:03,760 --> 02:50:04,660
And again,

5523
02:50:04,770 --> 02:50:06,000
I'm no better than anyone,

5524
02:50:06,360 --> 02:50:09,150
but I will understand that.

5525
02:50:09,210 --> 02:50:10,050
So when you were,

5526
02:50:10,080 --> 02:50:11,760
when you were saying seven
weeks or eight weeks,

5527
02:50:11,761 --> 02:50:12,660
so either one when you,

5528
02:50:13,190 --> 02:50:14,340
it's either going to be,

5529
02:50:14,580 --> 02:50:15,990
so my first day,

5530
02:50:16,200 --> 02:50:17,070
it's going to be a Monday.

5531
02:50:17,220 --> 02:50:21,450
So the first day in camp in
Oxnard will either be October 8th,

5532
02:50:21,480 --> 02:50:22,770
or October 15th.

5533
02:50:23,040 --> 02:50:23,720
October.

5534
02:50:23,720 --> 02:50:24,900
We represent eight weeks,

5535
02:50:24,901 --> 02:50:25,740
October 15,

5536
02:50:25,741 --> 02:50:26,574
seven weeks.

5537
02:50:26,970 --> 02:50:29,880
And that would mean I
would fly in on a Saturday,

5538
02:50:30,030 --> 02:50:31,860
get myself settled Sunday,

5539
02:50:31,861 --> 02:50:32,970
watch tape with him,

5540
02:50:33,790 --> 02:50:34,623
um,

5541
02:50:34,860 --> 02:50:35,430
uh,

5542
02:50:35,430 --> 02:50:38,310
and then start Monday with
a structured schedule,

5543
02:50:38,810 --> 02:50:39,643
you know,

5544
02:50:40,200 --> 02:50:42,120
with the ability to change at anytime.

5545
02:50:42,150 --> 02:50:43,140
Because again,

5546
02:50:43,700 --> 02:50:44,160
you see,

5547
02:50:44,160 --> 02:50:44,730
right.

5548
02:50:44,730 --> 02:50:45,563
You know,

5549
02:50:45,810 --> 02:50:47,610
I remember years ago I
was training fighters.

5550
02:50:47,611 --> 02:50:47,851
You know,

5551
02:50:47,851 --> 02:50:49,170
I've been around 40 years already.

5552
02:50:49,590 --> 02:50:52,350
I remember been Gleason's when
I moved down to Gleason's,

5553
02:50:52,351 --> 02:50:53,070
you know,

5554
02:50:53,070 --> 02:50:53,903
many years ago,

5555
02:50:54,180 --> 02:50:54,571
30,

5556
02:50:54,571 --> 02:50:55,404
whatever it was,

5557
02:50:55,590 --> 02:50:57,510
maybe more 35.

5558
02:50:58,230 --> 02:50:59,063
Um,

5559
02:50:59,370 --> 02:51:00,720
so Gleason's was in Manhattan,

5560
02:51:00,721 --> 02:51:01,570
it's in Brooklyn output.

5561
02:51:01,620 --> 02:51:02,371
It was a man.

5562
02:51:02,371 --> 02:51:03,360
It was the place,

5563
02:51:03,361 --> 02:51:03,900
you know,

5564
02:51:03,900 --> 02:51:05,520
and it was two blocks from
Madison Square Garden.

5565
02:51:05,610 --> 02:51:06,330
It was kind of cool,

5566
02:51:06,330 --> 02:51:06,930
you know,

5567
02:51:06,930 --> 02:51:07,763
so,

5568
02:51:08,100 --> 02:51:08,540
um,

5569
02:51:08,540 --> 02:51:09,251
I'm trying to find it.

5570
02:51:09,251 --> 02:51:13,140
And I remember I was the first
guy there and not bragging or not,

5571
02:51:13,290 --> 02:51:15,070
but I mean you just,

5572
02:51:15,470 --> 02:51:18,640
I would make my guys drink
water and he old time guys,

5573
02:51:18,710 --> 02:51:19,560
10 guys,

5574
02:51:19,760 --> 02:51:23,370
not because they knew it from scientific
ed visit and say other than it was

5575
02:51:23,371 --> 02:51:24,300
passed down to them.

5576
02:51:24,720 --> 02:51:25,560
It was taboo.

5577
02:51:25,740 --> 02:51:27,960
It was just passed down
to the tall drink water.

5578
02:51:28,670 --> 02:51:29,700
It makes you weak,

5579
02:51:30,210 --> 02:51:30,541
you know,

5580
02:51:30,541 --> 02:51:31,170
you've got to be tough.

5581
02:51:31,170 --> 02:51:31,800
Don't drink wine.

5582
02:51:31,800 --> 02:51:34,380
So I was making my guys
not only drink water,

5583
02:51:34,381 --> 02:51:35,430
drink a half a gallon,

5584
02:51:35,640 --> 02:51:36,780
I mean drink a lot of water.

5585
02:51:36,930 --> 02:51:38,820
So I remember some of the old timers,

5586
02:51:38,821 --> 02:51:40,350
would they be like talking about me?

5587
02:51:40,351 --> 02:51:41,184
They'd be like,

5588
02:51:41,670 --> 02:51:46,080
it's a fixed this guy don't drink
or don't follow what he's doing.

5589
02:51:46,230 --> 02:51:47,330
Because some of the fighters who say,

5590
02:51:47,331 --> 02:51:50,380
can I drink some water and
get loan that water and,

5591
02:51:50,390 --> 02:51:50,800
and,

5592
02:51:50,800 --> 02:51:52,350
and know would it gives you cramps.

5593
02:51:52,650 --> 02:51:53,080
It'll make you,

5594
02:51:53,080 --> 02:51:53,840
are you kidding?

5595
02:51:53,840 --> 02:51:54,030
No.

5596
02:51:54,030 --> 02:51:56,250
Don't give you cramps if
you drink a large amount.

5597
02:51:56,330 --> 02:51:57,440
Very cold and yeah,

5598
02:51:57,640 --> 02:51:57,910
yeah,

5599
02:51:57,910 --> 02:51:58,130
yeah.

5600
02:51:58,130 --> 02:51:58,740
You could go.

5601
02:51:58,740 --> 02:52:00,870
But now if we hydrate you,

5602
02:52:01,170 --> 02:52:02,640
it allows you to stay strong.

5603
02:52:03,300 --> 02:52:06,070
Try to drive a car because the
desert with no water in the radiator,

5604
02:52:06,220 --> 02:52:07,300
you might have a problem.

5605
02:52:08,770 --> 02:52:09,810
You might and,

5606
02:52:09,910 --> 02:52:10,260
and,

5607
02:52:10,260 --> 02:52:10,830
and,

5608
02:52:10,830 --> 02:52:13,900
but I'm telling you and I'm
not so all I was afraid no,

5609
02:52:13,901 --> 02:52:15,640
but I'm saying that that place,

5610
02:52:16,180 --> 02:52:18,460
the thing was nobody drank water,

5611
02:52:18,461 --> 02:52:19,294
spit it out.

5612
02:52:19,780 --> 02:52:22,600
And I was making my guys drink
and right in front of me.

5613
02:52:22,680 --> 02:52:23,291
Do you know though,

5614
02:52:23,291 --> 02:52:24,250
what was the difference?

5615
02:52:28,120 --> 02:52:29,170
I knew by learning.

5616
02:52:29,380 --> 02:52:31,630
I knew my father,

5617
02:52:32,170 --> 02:52:32,861
my father,

5618
02:52:32,861 --> 02:52:33,694
um,

5619
02:52:34,240 --> 02:52:36,220
talked about the importance of water.

5620
02:52:37,180 --> 02:52:37,601
You know,

5621
02:52:37,601 --> 02:52:38,411
he was proud.

5622
02:52:38,411 --> 02:52:39,244
I was training.

5623
02:52:39,610 --> 02:52:41,050
He thought it was going to be a lawyer.

5624
02:52:42,060 --> 02:52:45,110
He went a little different but a,

5625
02:52:45,140 --> 02:52:46,320
he was proud that it,

5626
02:52:46,390 --> 02:52:48,520
so he would talk to me like he was like,

5627
02:52:48,521 --> 02:52:50,210
I just got a to Osmosis,

5628
02:52:50,230 --> 02:52:51,041
if that makes sense.

5629
02:52:51,041 --> 02:52:51,874
I just,

5630
02:52:52,100 --> 02:52:52,740
I knew,

5631
02:52:52,740 --> 02:52:54,090
I knew water was healthy.

5632
02:52:54,130 --> 02:52:58,030
I knew it was important that you had to
rehydrate yourself and yet you had to,

5633
02:52:58,390 --> 02:53:01,600
my father had a thing with
water to my father would make,

5634
02:53:01,601 --> 02:53:03,970
my father got involved in my
training in different ways.

5635
02:53:04,240 --> 02:53:04,451
Like,

5636
02:53:04,451 --> 02:53:09,130
if my fighter was feeling a little weak
or he had a cut and he was healing from

5637
02:53:09,131 --> 02:53:11,050
the cut by father would say,

5638
02:53:11,500 --> 02:53:12,730
set them down in the ocean.

5639
02:53:13,090 --> 02:53:14,800
Why Dad?

5640
02:53:14,801 --> 02:53:17,560
We're not taking a vacation
part of them in the ocean.

5641
02:53:18,610 --> 02:53:19,200
I said,

5642
02:53:19,200 --> 02:53:20,033
all right,

5643
02:53:20,110 --> 02:53:20,920
okay.

5644
02:53:20,920 --> 02:53:22,210
Let them go in the ocean,

5645
02:53:22,270 --> 02:53:24,150
let them soak cause his scar,

5646
02:53:24,160 --> 02:53:25,120
whatever you know is called,

5647
02:53:25,390 --> 02:53:28,180
let them soak it in the ocean and uh,

5648
02:53:28,210 --> 02:53:29,400
don't go to Coney island.

5649
02:53:29,420 --> 02:53:30,490
Thought that might not be good,

5650
02:53:32,390 --> 02:53:33,223
but

5651
02:53:34,350 --> 02:53:35,320
that might not heal you,

5652
02:53:35,590 --> 02:53:37,690
but change it might change.

5653
02:53:37,691 --> 02:53:38,980
It might be green when you come out,

5654
02:53:40,330 --> 02:53:42,050
you got something going on with the hulk.

5655
02:53:42,340 --> 02:53:42,641
But,

5656
02:53:42,641 --> 02:53:43,390
um,

5657
02:53:43,390 --> 02:53:43,601
no,

5658
02:53:43,601 --> 02:53:44,710
but so no,

5659
02:53:44,711 --> 02:53:46,700
he would tell me in a
series where he said 30,

5660
02:53:47,260 --> 02:53:48,093
um,

5661
02:53:48,370 --> 02:53:49,360
send you a fighter.

5662
02:53:49,870 --> 02:53:51,080
If he's a little of,

5663
02:53:51,140 --> 02:53:53,050
he needs to be revitalized a little,

5664
02:53:53,110 --> 02:53:55,320
set them to the ocean
that was swimming ocean.

5665
02:53:55,320 --> 02:53:57,980
Let them be in the sun and let them soak.

5666
02:53:57,981 --> 02:53:58,571
So whatever,

5667
02:53:58,571 --> 02:54:00,340
concealing the notion and,

5668
02:54:00,360 --> 02:54:03,040
and if he happens to swallow some water,

5669
02:54:03,160 --> 02:54:06,670
it's okay because I have no one wanted
to swallow the seawater and the worst

5670
02:54:06,671 --> 02:54:07,450
thing in the world.

5671
02:54:07,450 --> 02:54:08,170
My father said,

5672
02:54:08,170 --> 02:54:09,003
it's okay.

5673
02:54:09,070 --> 02:54:09,903
Not the worst thing.

5674
02:54:09,940 --> 02:54:10,780
So one day,

5675
02:54:10,781 --> 02:54:15,781
I guess I got around to asking him why
he was so into sending my fighters to the

5676
02:54:16,541 --> 02:54:17,290
ocean.

5677
02:54:17,290 --> 02:54:18,123
And he told me he was,

5678
02:54:18,190 --> 02:54:18,880
he just,

5679
02:54:18,880 --> 02:54:20,440
that's how my father would say things.

5680
02:54:20,770 --> 02:54:22,900
He would just tell me things
and that's where I would learn.

5681
02:54:23,290 --> 02:54:24,340
And he just said to me,

5682
02:54:24,940 --> 02:54:26,710
ocean is where all life came from.

5683
02:54:27,130 --> 02:54:29,830
All Life on earth started in the ocean,

5684
02:54:30,520 --> 02:54:31,450
microcosms,

5685
02:54:31,451 --> 02:54:32,320
whatever you want to call.

5686
02:54:32,321 --> 02:54:34,000
They didn't get into all technical stuff,

5687
02:54:34,001 --> 02:54:37,900
but he said it started in the
ocean and it came out onto land.

5688
02:54:38,260 --> 02:54:38,711
He says,

5689
02:54:38,711 --> 02:54:43,711
all percentage of salt in our blood is
the exact same percentage per skew begins

5690
02:54:44,190 --> 02:54:45,160
with a cubic gains.

5691
02:54:45,160 --> 02:54:45,371
You know,

5692
02:54:45,371 --> 02:54:46,100
whatever it was,

5693
02:54:46,100 --> 02:54:48,090
I'm just saying,

5694
02:54:48,310 --> 02:54:50,150
probably not close to what he said,

5695
02:54:50,320 --> 02:54:51,190
but close enough,

5696
02:54:51,570 --> 02:54:52,030
um,

5697
02:54:52,030 --> 02:54:55,180
is the exact amount cubic
inch as it is in the ocean.

5698
02:54:55,390 --> 02:54:56,500
We come from the ocean.

5699
02:54:56,501 --> 02:54:57,940
All life comes from the ocean.

5700
02:54:58,210 --> 02:54:59,830
Go back to where life came from.

5701
02:55:00,970 --> 02:55:01,930
That was enough for me.

5702
02:55:02,740 --> 02:55:03,980
My father was telling me anything.

5703
02:55:03,981 --> 02:55:05,150
My father told me that was it.

5704
02:55:05,840 --> 02:55:07,340
So I said,

5705
02:55:07,341 --> 02:55:08,174
all right.

5706
02:55:08,330 --> 02:55:09,020
So,

5707
02:55:09,020 --> 02:55:09,853
um,

5708
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:10,910
so a matter of fact,

5709
02:55:10,911 --> 02:55:11,721
he told me his story.

5710
02:55:11,721 --> 02:55:14,450
I remember I was going out with a girl,

5711
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:15,833
um,

5712
02:55:15,950 --> 02:55:20,950
that had a little baby that
had a Bolex and he told me,

5713
02:55:22,521 --> 02:55:23,354
he said,

5714
02:55:23,840 --> 02:55:24,920
and he was serious,

5715
02:55:24,921 --> 02:55:26,150
he wouldn't say it otherwise,

5716
02:55:26,480 --> 02:55:27,860
but he said send it down.

5717
02:55:27,861 --> 02:55:31,130
He had a condominium and they
told the beach and he said,

5718
02:55:31,790 --> 02:55:33,200
sent it down to Daytona Beach,

5719
02:55:33,201 --> 02:55:37,700
let them stay there for the summer and
let her boy being the ocean and the sun

5720
02:55:37,790 --> 02:55:39,020
vitamin a vitamin D.

5721
02:55:39,021 --> 02:55:39,320
Right.

5722
02:55:39,320 --> 02:55:40,153
I didn't know that.

5723
02:55:40,460 --> 02:55:40,880
Um,

5724
02:55:40,880 --> 02:55:42,230
and it is street and his legs out.

5725
02:55:43,270 --> 02:55:43,580
Yeah,

5726
02:55:43,580 --> 02:55:44,630
his legs or get straight.

5727
02:55:44,631 --> 02:55:45,650
They won't crazy,

5728
02:55:45,651 --> 02:55:45,951
you know,

5729
02:55:45,951 --> 02:55:46,970
but you know,

5730
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:48,200
there was a cook in this to him.

5731
02:55:48,440 --> 02:55:52,940
His legs are good straight and he was
right because by being in the ocean,

5732
02:55:52,941 --> 02:55:53,930
by being in the sun,

5733
02:55:53,931 --> 02:55:55,880
vitamin A and d healthy,

5734
02:55:55,881 --> 02:55:56,510
of course,

5735
02:55:56,510 --> 02:56:00,290
I guess part of it was the swimming and
part of it was the ocean and part of it

5736
02:56:00,291 --> 02:56:01,124
was the sun,

5737
02:56:01,280 --> 02:56:02,840
but it was straight in his legs.

5738
02:56:03,140 --> 02:56:06,230
And I looked at he need him to the
point where you had to put braces.

5739
02:56:06,290 --> 02:56:07,123
No,

5740
02:56:07,370 --> 02:56:12,370
but was there was a slight issue was
the initial it was a dramatic no,

5741
02:56:12,680 --> 02:56:13,660
but did,

5742
02:56:13,670 --> 02:56:14,690
but he say work.

5743
02:56:14,720 --> 02:56:15,553
Yeah.

5744
02:56:15,740 --> 02:56:16,370
Was it right?

5745
02:56:16,370 --> 02:56:17,203
Yeah.

5746
02:56:17,660 --> 02:56:17,961
You know,

5747
02:56:17,961 --> 02:56:19,670
but we just think of braces,

5748
02:56:19,700 --> 02:56:19,971
you know,

5749
02:56:19,971 --> 02:56:20,804
obviously.

5750
02:56:21,020 --> 02:56:21,853
And um,

5751
02:56:22,130 --> 02:56:23,810
but yeah,

5752
02:56:23,840 --> 02:56:24,710
and it would heal.

5753
02:56:24,711 --> 02:56:26,200
He would say glitter cod.

5754
02:56:26,300 --> 02:56:28,190
Coney Ocean is salt water.

5755
02:56:28,580 --> 02:56:30,680
He owes the cut.

5756
02:56:30,710 --> 02:56:31,970
It will heal the clot.

5757
02:56:32,430 --> 02:56:34,580
A lot of fighters used to
soak their facing Brian,

5758
02:56:34,581 --> 02:56:34,701
right?

5759
02:56:34,701 --> 02:56:35,091
Yes.

5760
02:56:35,091 --> 02:56:35,301
Yeah.

5761
02:56:35,301 --> 02:56:36,330
Well Joe Frazier did.

5762
02:56:36,420 --> 02:56:36,810
Yeah.

5763
02:56:36,810 --> 02:56:40,770
Did that really keep you that your skin
tough and protect you from cuts or is

5764
02:56:40,771 --> 02:56:41,870
that an old wives tale?

5765
02:56:42,460 --> 02:56:44,260
That's a little bit of that old stuff.

5766
02:56:44,290 --> 02:56:44,740
You know,

5767
02:56:44,740 --> 02:56:45,670
where we don't know.

5768
02:56:45,810 --> 02:56:46,240
Right.

5769
02:56:46,240 --> 02:56:48,280
But they believed it and so,

5770
02:56:48,340 --> 02:56:49,173
you know,

5771
02:56:49,680 --> 02:56:51,100
he'd smell like a pickle when he was,

5772
02:56:53,320 --> 02:56:54,340
when he was following with you,

5773
02:56:54,341 --> 02:56:56,180
get hungry in any hit
you a lot of talking.

5774
02:56:59,310 --> 02:57:01,200
But other controversial training methods,

5775
02:57:01,201 --> 02:57:03,990
like a weightlifting for the
longest time was thought to taboo,

5776
02:57:04,080 --> 02:57:04,470
taboo,

5777
02:57:04,470 --> 02:57:05,280
taboo,

5778
02:57:05,280 --> 02:57:06,001
holy field.

5779
02:57:06,001 --> 02:57:10,020
The Mackie shall stone Mackey shell stones
training or Holyfield and moving him

5780
02:57:10,021 --> 02:57:11,790
up from a cruiser way to a heavyweight.

5781
02:57:11,870 --> 02:57:12,570
He you true.

5782
02:57:12,570 --> 02:57:14,640
And it was a very light heavy
weight at the beginning,

5783
02:57:14,641 --> 02:57:15,180
right?

5784
02:57:15,180 --> 02:57:16,070
Cruiserweight yeah,

5785
02:57:16,370 --> 02:57:20,130
we really essentially was and they just
pack some meat on them Michael Spinks

5786
02:57:20,160 --> 02:57:20,993
with Yup,

5787
02:57:21,030 --> 02:57:21,480
that's right.

5788
02:57:21,480 --> 02:57:22,930
Michael Spinks was really the first,

5789
02:57:22,950 --> 02:57:23,370
yeah.

5790
02:57:23,370 --> 02:57:27,360
When he fought Larry Holmes and Mackey
shall stone worked with Holyfield after

5791
02:57:27,361 --> 02:57:27,690
that.

5792
02:57:27,690 --> 02:57:28,141
That's right.

5793
02:57:28,141 --> 02:57:28,940
Right.

5794
02:57:28,940 --> 02:57:29,390
Um,

5795
02:57:29,390 --> 02:57:30,223
yeah.

5796
02:57:30,590 --> 02:57:32,290
Listen and Gleason,

5797
02:57:32,300 --> 02:57:34,280
I'm going to go back to
Gleason's the epicenter,

5798
02:57:34,310 --> 02:57:35,120
you know,

5799
02:57:35,120 --> 02:57:35,953
to place

5800
02:57:37,100 --> 02:57:37,933
no water,

5801
02:57:38,090 --> 02:57:38,800
no weights.

5802
02:57:38,800 --> 02:57:39,633
Right.

5803
02:57:40,160 --> 02:57:40,700
I got,

5804
02:57:40,700 --> 02:57:43,760
I used to have my fighters
to wait if I felt,

5805
02:57:45,410 --> 02:57:48,380
if I felt that a fighter wasn't
physically strong enough,

5806
02:57:48,680 --> 02:57:49,880
I put them on a weight program,

5807
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:51,020
but I do it myself.

5808
02:57:51,200 --> 02:57:51,600
I would,

5809
02:57:51,600 --> 02:57:53,120
there was no strength coaches back then.

5810
02:57:53,360 --> 02:57:53,601
But,

5811
02:57:53,601 --> 02:57:56,480
but just the common sense
program three days a week,

5812
02:57:56,810 --> 02:57:57,290
you know,

5813
02:57:57,290 --> 02:57:58,101
eat protein,

5814
02:57:58,101 --> 02:58:01,620
of course you have to replenish yourself
with the proper diet and all that

5815
02:58:01,621 --> 02:58:02,160
stuff,

5816
02:58:02,160 --> 02:58:02,790
but,

5817
02:58:02,790 --> 02:58:05,700
and do it at the right time in between
the training where you're not killing,

5818
02:58:05,701 --> 02:58:06,790
you say overtraining.

5819
02:58:06,800 --> 02:58:07,030
Right.

5820
02:58:07,030 --> 02:58:07,380
You know,

5821
02:58:07,380 --> 02:58:08,390
go spar entire,

5822
02:58:08,490 --> 02:58:09,323
that's right.

5823
02:58:09,360 --> 02:58:11,640
You don't have to separation of workouts.

5824
02:58:11,910 --> 02:58:16,890
But if I had a slightly built guy that I
taught two things and the second one is

5825
02:58:16,891 --> 02:58:21,891
one where probably sounds a little that
you wouldn't have would normally connect

5826
02:58:22,471 --> 02:58:23,070
to it.

5827
02:58:23,070 --> 02:58:26,130
But the first thing was if I thought he
could physically be a little stronger,

5828
02:58:26,700 --> 02:58:28,800
not that he had to be fighting inside,

5829
02:58:28,830 --> 02:58:30,290
but when he did fight inside,

5830
02:58:30,300 --> 02:58:31,680
because that's face of your fighter,

5831
02:58:31,890 --> 02:58:33,330
you're going to wind up and walk quarters.

5832
02:58:33,390 --> 02:58:34,680
You are even though you say,

5833
02:58:34,681 --> 02:58:35,910
well I'm going to live on the outside.

5834
02:58:35,970 --> 02:58:36,803
Okay.

5835
02:58:36,810 --> 02:58:39,060
Until that day that the Guy
Slips Your Jab and again,

5836
02:58:39,330 --> 02:58:40,830
now you live in any inside.

5837
02:58:41,280 --> 02:58:43,260
Are you ready to live on
the inside for a minute?

5838
02:58:43,590 --> 02:58:45,210
So I believe that.

5839
02:58:45,390 --> 02:58:49,740
So I would make my guys two weights if I
told physically they could get help and

5840
02:58:49,741 --> 02:58:50,970
improvement in those areas.

5841
02:58:50,971 --> 02:58:54,000
But I also did it for
the psychological reason.

5842
02:58:54,540 --> 02:58:57,990
I felt that it's all psychological battle.

5843
02:58:58,050 --> 02:58:59,790
It's 75% psychological,

5844
02:58:59,791 --> 02:59:04,791
mental and you have to do any gene you
can to help to fight her in that area.

5845
02:59:04,950 --> 02:59:05,640
Anything,

5846
02:59:05,640 --> 02:59:06,271
anything,

5847
02:59:06,271 --> 02:59:09,870
grab anything that's if there's something
floating over your head are grabbing

5848
02:59:10,290 --> 02:59:13,380
anything and the mental part.

5849
02:59:13,800 --> 02:59:14,280
If,

5850
02:59:14,280 --> 02:59:15,780
if you make them feel stronger,

5851
02:59:17,010 --> 02:59:17,880
he'll be stronger.

5852
02:59:18,210 --> 02:59:19,710
If that's something that,

5853
02:59:19,920 --> 02:59:24,920
that just gives him a little I
older more of confidence and belief.

5854
02:59:25,380 --> 02:59:25,891
Now listen,

5855
02:59:25,891 --> 02:59:26,460
here's the,

5856
02:59:26,460 --> 02:59:30,600
here's the catch 22 maybe you
don't want the guy fighting inside.

5857
02:59:30,601 --> 02:59:31,530
Maybe his style,

5858
02:59:31,531 --> 02:59:34,990
his makeup is the fight I get to because
of the smart guys out there listening.

5859
02:59:35,020 --> 02:59:35,853
I'm sure there are.

5860
02:59:35,970 --> 02:59:37,920
They're going to think
that before he said it.

5861
02:59:38,160 --> 02:59:38,880
Yeah.

5862
02:59:38,880 --> 02:59:40,080
I still want them to feel strong.

5863
02:59:40,081 --> 02:59:40,914
Okay.

5864
02:59:41,100 --> 02:59:41,933
I'm not going to make,

5865
02:59:41,940 --> 02:59:45,900
I'm not going to make a guide that should
box like pinel where go was your box

5866
02:59:45,901 --> 02:59:46,770
like Muhammad Ali.

5867
02:59:46,920 --> 02:59:49,290
I'm not going to let them Mike
and fight like Jake Lamata.

5868
02:59:49,560 --> 02:59:50,393
I,

5869
02:59:50,430 --> 02:59:51,360
I'm okay with that,

5870
02:59:51,690 --> 02:59:53,430
but I want them to feel stronger.

5871
02:59:53,850 --> 02:59:54,683
I fought them.

5872
02:59:54,870 --> 02:59:56,520
What kind of weightlifting
would you have them do?

5873
02:59:57,060 --> 02:59:57,840
Because you're,

5874
02:59:57,840 --> 03:00:00,060
do you have a background in
lifting weights yourself?

5875
03:00:00,120 --> 03:00:00,360
No.

5876
03:00:00,360 --> 03:00:00,601
No.

5877
03:00:00,601 --> 03:00:02,010
Other than I played football,

5878
03:00:02,011 --> 03:00:02,970
so he was around it.

5879
03:00:03,370 --> 03:00:06,540
And I've been around
Jim's my whole life and,

5880
03:00:06,640 --> 03:00:08,550
and fitness people all my life.

5881
03:00:08,760 --> 03:00:11,160
So I understand the plyometrics.

5882
03:00:11,161 --> 03:00:14,190
I understood all the advancements
or the new stuff that came out,

5883
03:00:14,430 --> 03:00:15,300
the bands that,

5884
03:00:15,420 --> 03:00:15,751
you know,

5885
03:00:15,751 --> 03:00:16,290
the,

5886
03:00:16,290 --> 03:00:16,771
hey listen,

5887
03:00:16,771 --> 03:00:20,430
you've got to remember there was a guy
named Charles Atlas that started with

5888
03:00:20,431 --> 03:00:21,750
resistance training,

5889
03:00:21,770 --> 03:00:22,740
who he was,

5890
03:00:22,741 --> 03:00:22,950
uh,

5891
03:00:22,950 --> 03:00:25,390
somebody kicked sand in his
face and his comic book.

5892
03:00:26,100 --> 03:00:26,520
Right.

5893
03:00:26,520 --> 03:00:26,951
And,

5894
03:00:26,951 --> 03:00:28,020
and you know,

5895
03:00:28,021 --> 03:00:29,400
I don't know if it was related or not,

5896
03:00:29,610 --> 03:00:30,443
but um,

5897
03:00:30,750 --> 03:00:31,740
but you know,

5898
03:00:31,790 --> 03:00:31,990
he,

5899
03:00:31,990 --> 03:00:33,210
he did isometrics.

5900
03:00:33,330 --> 03:00:34,710
I believed in Isometrix.

5901
03:00:34,860 --> 03:00:38,910
I did isometrics for the whole camp with
Michael Morell for the Holyfield fight.

5902
03:00:38,911 --> 03:00:39,744
Believe it or not.

5903
03:00:39,990 --> 03:00:40,500
Yeah.

5904
03:00:40,500 --> 03:00:44,370
I used to put my hand here and I used
to make him push against my hand,

5905
03:00:44,550 --> 03:00:46,260
but ways that we can push it,

5906
03:00:46,440 --> 03:00:51,440
I would design all kinds of different
exercises in ways to do it where I just

5907
03:00:52,021 --> 03:00:53,700
gave him resistance with my own body,

5908
03:00:54,330 --> 03:00:56,070
sometimes push against my shoulder,

5909
03:00:57,330 --> 03:00:57,581
you know,

5910
03:00:57,581 --> 03:00:58,141
and be careful.

5911
03:00:58,141 --> 03:00:59,440
The joints you won't in the,

5912
03:00:59,560 --> 03:01:00,130
you know,

5913
03:01:00,130 --> 03:01:01,330
all common sense stuff.

5914
03:01:01,380 --> 03:01:01,870
Yeah.

5915
03:01:01,870 --> 03:01:02,560
But,

5916
03:01:02,560 --> 03:01:03,100
um,

5917
03:01:03,100 --> 03:01:03,551
so we,

5918
03:01:03,551 --> 03:01:03,820
we,

5919
03:01:03,820 --> 03:01:05,830
this is something that
you thought of yourself,

5920
03:01:05,831 --> 03:01:08,500
you were trying to figure out how to
do it and then you just implemented it.

5921
03:01:08,560 --> 03:01:09,393
Yeah.

5922
03:01:09,730 --> 03:01:09,911
Yeah.

5923
03:01:09,911 --> 03:01:12,340
This is something that
a Michael Moore man,

5924
03:01:12,341 --> 03:01:13,390
when he was a light heavyweight,

5925
03:01:13,391 --> 03:01:14,950
was a murderous puncher.

5926
03:01:15,310 --> 03:01:16,730
Murder murderous boy.

5927
03:01:16,731 --> 03:01:17,290
Oh boy.

5928
03:01:17,290 --> 03:01:18,123
Woo.

5929
03:01:18,160 --> 03:01:19,090
He was dangerous.

5930
03:01:19,120 --> 03:01:20,140
He was so scary.

5931
03:01:20,141 --> 03:01:22,810
But it seemed like the
weight cut was too brutal.

5932
03:01:23,320 --> 03:01:23,711
Yeah.

5933
03:01:23,711 --> 03:01:24,670
It was brutal.

5934
03:01:24,760 --> 03:01:25,061
And,

5935
03:01:25,061 --> 03:01:25,750
um,

5936
03:01:25,750 --> 03:01:27,580
he was a terrifying light heavyweight.

5937
03:01:27,610 --> 03:01:27,851
Yeah.

5938
03:01:27,851 --> 03:01:28,490
He was,

5939
03:01:28,490 --> 03:01:29,350
I forgot about him.

5940
03:01:29,380 --> 03:01:30,990
They forgot about him
as a light heavyweight.

5941
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:31,930
He'd knocked everyone out.

5942
03:01:32,120 --> 03:01:34,870
Just don't think he went
the distance with anybody.

5943
03:01:34,960 --> 03:01:35,740
He was murdering people.

5944
03:01:35,740 --> 03:01:35,980
Yeah.

5945
03:01:35,980 --> 03:01:37,210
He was really something.

5946
03:01:37,390 --> 03:01:37,860
Yeah.

5947
03:01:37,860 --> 03:01:39,130
And a first heavyweight,

5948
03:01:39,200 --> 03:01:39,520
uh,

5949
03:01:39,520 --> 03:01:40,280
first sao point,

5950
03:01:40,280 --> 03:01:42,190
heavyweight champ of whole time first.

5951
03:01:42,260 --> 03:01:43,093
Is that true?

5952
03:01:43,270 --> 03:01:43,790
Wow.

5953
03:01:43,790 --> 03:01:44,623
Yeah.

5954
03:01:45,100 --> 03:01:45,760
Wow.

5955
03:01:45,760 --> 03:01:46,360
Yeah,

5956
03:01:46,360 --> 03:01:46,900
that'd be true.

5957
03:01:46,900 --> 03:01:47,700
I've been saying,

5958
03:01:47,700 --> 03:01:48,580
I'm sure it is.

5959
03:01:49,210 --> 03:01:49,840
I didn't know.

5960
03:01:49,840 --> 03:01:50,080
Yeah,

5961
03:01:50,080 --> 03:01:50,321
no,

5962
03:01:50,321 --> 03:01:51,100
he was,

5963
03:01:51,100 --> 03:01:51,933
it could match them up.

5964
03:01:52,360 --> 03:01:52,891
Good person.

5965
03:01:52,891 --> 03:01:53,560
Very good guy.

5966
03:01:53,560 --> 03:01:53,780
Yeah.

5967
03:01:53,780 --> 03:01:55,090
He's like,

5968
03:01:55,091 --> 03:01:55,571
all of us,

5969
03:01:55,571 --> 03:01:57,820
we get lost and we get confused,

5970
03:01:57,821 --> 03:01:58,654
all of us,

5971
03:01:59,020 --> 03:01:59,853
but he's a good,

5972
03:01:59,890 --> 03:02:00,191
you know,

5973
03:02:00,191 --> 03:02:00,671
you go to,

5974
03:02:00,671 --> 03:02:01,181
you're not good,

5975
03:02:01,181 --> 03:02:01,420
right?

5976
03:02:01,420 --> 03:02:01,880
Yeah,

5977
03:02:01,880 --> 03:02:03,200
he's you,

5978
03:02:03,280 --> 03:02:04,450
you want to hear crazy thing.

5979
03:02:04,890 --> 03:02:05,723
Um,

5980
03:02:06,460 --> 03:02:07,293
some people might,

5981
03:02:07,510 --> 03:02:08,343
I hope they don't.

5982
03:02:09,670 --> 03:02:10,270
Whatever.

5983
03:02:10,270 --> 03:02:12,430
I hope they don't take it the wrong way,

5984
03:02:12,431 --> 03:02:13,840
but anyway,

5985
03:02:15,130 --> 03:02:16,630
it's meant to be the good way.

5986
03:02:17,380 --> 03:02:18,213
Um,

5987
03:02:19,780 --> 03:02:20,441
I have a friend,

5988
03:02:20,441 --> 03:02:21,190
a very close friend.

5989
03:02:21,190 --> 03:02:22,240
I hate politicians.

5990
03:02:22,480 --> 03:02:23,313
I think they're phony,

5991
03:02:23,920 --> 03:02:25,420
but I have one that's,

5992
03:02:26,130 --> 03:02:27,670
he makes a live in a politician,

5993
03:02:27,671 --> 03:02:29,110
but he don't live as a politician.

5994
03:02:29,280 --> 03:02:30,113
Does that make sense?

5995
03:02:30,420 --> 03:02:32,730
I know he saying he's took
both president of stand on,

5996
03:02:32,750 --> 03:02:37,120
his name is Jimmy Hall and I'm probably
go crazy if he hears this put anyway.

5997
03:02:37,750 --> 03:02:38,583
It's okay.

5998
03:02:39,010 --> 03:02:39,671
He's a little crazy.

5999
03:02:39,671 --> 03:02:39,941
Anyway,

6000
03:02:39,941 --> 03:02:40,810
that's why we get along.

6001
03:02:41,110 --> 03:02:41,950
But he's a good man.

6002
03:02:42,460 --> 03:02:43,293
And uh,

6003
03:02:43,680 --> 03:02:45,550
like my father was born to be a doctor.

6004
03:02:45,551 --> 03:02:46,330
He was my,

6005
03:02:46,330 --> 03:02:46,530
my,

6006
03:02:46,530 --> 03:02:47,363
his mother knew it.

6007
03:02:48,100 --> 03:02:49,450
He was born to be,

6008
03:02:51,490 --> 03:02:52,323
I don't know,

6009
03:02:52,450 --> 03:02:53,870
I don't want to use the word politician.

6010
03:02:53,871 --> 03:02:55,230
Seems like a dirty word leader.

6011
03:02:55,540 --> 03:02:55,930
Yeah.

6012
03:02:55,930 --> 03:02:56,710
Aliyah.

6013
03:02:56,710 --> 03:02:56,971
Uh,

6014
03:02:56,971 --> 03:02:58,030
a carer of people.

6015
03:02:58,330 --> 03:02:59,163
All right.

6016
03:02:59,770 --> 03:03:00,940
I'm a public servant,

6017
03:03:00,941 --> 03:03:01,774
maybe whatever.

6018
03:03:01,780 --> 03:03:02,613
But anyway,

6019
03:03:03,070 --> 03:03:06,630
so he's the boat
president of Santa and he,

6020
03:03:06,880 --> 03:03:08,260
he really does things.

6021
03:03:09,160 --> 03:03:09,491
And,

6022
03:03:09,491 --> 03:03:10,324
um,

6023
03:03:11,530 --> 03:03:12,040
anyway,

6024
03:03:12,040 --> 03:03:13,990
we're close and he just gave,

6025
03:03:13,991 --> 03:03:15,910
is $94,000 for the foundation.

6026
03:03:15,911 --> 03:03:16,744
Like a week ago.

6027
03:03:17,530 --> 03:03:18,363
He does that.

6028
03:03:18,400 --> 03:03:20,260
He finds the money and you know,

6029
03:03:20,650 --> 03:03:23,020
he knows who he says is
the greatest compliment.

6030
03:03:23,021 --> 03:03:23,291
He goes,

6031
03:03:23,291 --> 03:03:23,580
I know.

6032
03:03:23,580 --> 03:03:24,413
It's called,

6033
03:03:25,060 --> 03:03:25,960
I know where it's going.

6034
03:03:26,530 --> 03:03:26,801
And,

6035
03:03:26,801 --> 03:03:27,634
um,

6036
03:03:28,180 --> 03:03:28,661
thank you.

6037
03:03:28,661 --> 03:03:29,500
He says to me and said,

6038
03:03:29,501 --> 03:03:30,370
what are you thanking me for?

6039
03:03:30,371 --> 03:03:31,204
Thank you.

6040
03:03:31,390 --> 03:03:33,010
I can't help these people without you.

6041
03:03:33,190 --> 03:03:33,371
You know,

6042
03:03:33,371 --> 03:03:34,150
I get all the help.

6043
03:03:34,150 --> 03:03:35,980
We do fundraisers and we do things.

6044
03:03:36,280 --> 03:03:37,120
We do a big dinner,

6045
03:03:37,150 --> 03:03:40,720
thousand people a week before Thanksgiving
where we have people like Tony Dancer

6046
03:03:40,721 --> 03:03:43,060
and Phil Sims and bill
pause cells use to calm.

6047
03:03:43,210 --> 03:03:44,110
He don't come no more.

6048
03:03:44,111 --> 03:03:45,520
He don't leave Florida anymore.

6049
03:03:45,940 --> 03:03:46,420
But,

6050
03:03:46,420 --> 03:03:46,691
but,

6051
03:03:46,691 --> 03:03:47,170
um,

6052
03:03:47,170 --> 03:03:47,801
you know,

6053
03:03:47,801 --> 03:03:48,634
we,

6054
03:03:49,120 --> 03:03:49,690
I mean,

6055
03:03:49,690 --> 03:03:50,470
uh,

6056
03:03:50,470 --> 03:03:53,110
Patrick Ewing to Campbell Mutombo uh,

6057
03:03:53,440 --> 03:03:53,950
uh,

6058
03:03:53,950 --> 03:03:54,430
I mean,

6059
03:03:54,430 --> 03:03:54,811
we're,

6060
03:03:54,811 --> 03:03:55,600
we're blessed.

6061
03:03:55,600 --> 03:03:57,100
We're blessed with Wolski Perez.

6062
03:03:57,290 --> 03:03:58,123
She loved pork.

6063
03:03:58,640 --> 03:03:59,850
She loves to have a,

6064
03:04:00,050 --> 03:04:00,883
I mean,

6065
03:04:01,310 --> 03:04:02,330
we were blessed.

6066
03:04:03,110 --> 03:04:03,890
Um,

6067
03:04:03,890 --> 03:04:05,720
Brandon Marshall from
the giants last year.

6068
03:04:06,680 --> 03:04:11,680
They come and they allow me to have a
successful dinner because they come and

6069
03:04:11,841 --> 03:04:13,990
they don't get a sense
because nobody gets upset.

6070
03:04:14,660 --> 03:04:15,500
And um,

6071
03:04:16,400 --> 03:04:18,620
so with all that in with Jimmy,

6072
03:04:19,160 --> 03:04:20,360
so anyway,

6073
03:04:20,930 --> 03:04:23,720
I have these things that
I just say sometimes.

6074
03:04:23,930 --> 03:04:25,190
So he caught me one time,

6075
03:04:25,250 --> 03:04:26,480
but I was just saying it,

6076
03:04:26,750 --> 03:04:28,530
I didn't realize that it
was going to register,

6077
03:04:28,580 --> 03:04:28,821
you know,

6078
03:04:28,821 --> 03:04:29,870
because it's just something,

6079
03:04:30,410 --> 03:04:31,243
you know,

6080
03:04:31,580 --> 03:04:32,520
so I just said

6081
03:04:34,310 --> 03:04:35,143
people bad.

6082
03:04:35,510 --> 03:04:35,991
So he said,

6083
03:04:35,991 --> 03:04:36,824
why?

6084
03:04:37,940 --> 03:04:38,510
I said,

6085
03:04:38,510 --> 03:04:39,343
well,

6086
03:04:39,790 --> 03:04:40,623
because what you say?

6087
03:04:41,060 --> 03:04:41,420
I said,

6088
03:04:41,420 --> 03:04:41,850
no.

6089
03:04:41,850 --> 03:04:42,420
I said,

6090
03:04:42,420 --> 03:04:44,660
you know what words to live by people bad.

6091
03:04:44,960 --> 03:04:45,820
So I've choking her.

6092
03:04:45,950 --> 03:04:47,000
But he said people bad.

6093
03:04:47,630 --> 03:04:49,040
So he said,

6094
03:04:49,041 --> 03:04:49,460
what do you mean?

6095
03:04:49,460 --> 03:04:49,920
I said,

6096
03:04:49,920 --> 03:04:50,450
Nah,

6097
03:04:50,450 --> 03:04:51,560
people bad.

6098
03:04:51,830 --> 03:04:52,191
He said,

6099
03:04:52,191 --> 03:04:52,910
but you help,

6100
03:04:52,910 --> 03:04:53,870
you're in a business.

6101
03:04:54,140 --> 03:04:54,830
I said,

6102
03:04:54,830 --> 03:04:56,000
there's good people too.

6103
03:04:56,930 --> 03:04:57,763
So anyway,

6104
03:04:58,070 --> 03:04:58,970
about a month ago,

6105
03:04:59,240 --> 03:04:59,811
two months ago,

6106
03:04:59,811 --> 03:05:00,350
whatever,

6107
03:05:00,350 --> 03:05:01,510
he comes up to me and he says,

6108
03:05:01,511 --> 03:05:02,870
you've got to think I'm out of my mind.

6109
03:05:03,230 --> 03:05:03,531
I said,

6110
03:05:03,531 --> 03:05:03,621
well,

6111
03:05:03,621 --> 03:05:03,771
no,

6112
03:05:03,771 --> 03:05:04,450
I know,

6113
03:05:04,450 --> 03:05:05,540
but for what?

6114
03:05:05,620 --> 03:05:06,560
What's the matter?

6115
03:05:06,950 --> 03:05:07,783
He said,

6116
03:05:08,630 --> 03:05:09,650
with your permission,

6117
03:05:10,670 --> 03:05:11,900
I want to take a domain,

6118
03:05:11,901 --> 03:05:13,400
which I barely know what that means.

6119
03:05:13,760 --> 03:05:16,880
Copyright to the phrase people bad.

6120
03:05:17,960 --> 03:05:18,793
And

6121
03:05:20,270 --> 03:05:23,720
if I told you I wanted to start a
business with you and me and the proceeds,

6122
03:05:24,260 --> 03:05:26,210
some of the proceeds will
go to the foundation.

6123
03:05:26,570 --> 03:05:27,710
We sell shorts would do that.

6124
03:05:28,010 --> 03:05:29,600
And you have these different sayings.

6125
03:05:29,870 --> 03:05:30,920
So to start with people,

6126
03:05:30,921 --> 03:05:31,754
bad

6127
03:05:33,050 --> 03:05:33,801
resiliency,

6128
03:05:33,801 --> 03:05:34,371
good people,

6129
03:05:34,371 --> 03:05:36,320
bad forgiveness,

6130
03:05:36,321 --> 03:05:37,131
good people,

6131
03:05:37,131 --> 03:05:38,870
bad be better people,

6132
03:05:38,871 --> 03:05:40,730
bad parks,

6133
03:05:40,731 --> 03:05:41,564
good

6134
03:05:42,890 --> 03:05:43,281
people,

6135
03:05:43,281 --> 03:05:44,114
bad,

6136
03:05:44,360 --> 03:05:45,193
you know,

6137
03:05:45,440 --> 03:05:46,191
redemption,

6138
03:05:46,191 --> 03:05:48,440
good people bad.

6139
03:05:49,490 --> 03:05:50,600
That's be bad,

6140
03:05:50,630 --> 03:05:50,901
you know,

6141
03:05:50,901 --> 03:05:51,321
whatever.

6142
03:05:51,321 --> 03:05:56,321
But the whole idea is to be unapologetic
and to say we got a problem.

6143
03:05:57,860 --> 03:05:59,930
I don't know if you want to
say we're at a tilting point,

6144
03:06:00,170 --> 03:06:01,010
but we got a problem.

6145
03:06:01,040 --> 03:06:02,360
If my as social genius,

6146
03:06:02,361 --> 03:06:03,800
no am I is saint.

6147
03:06:03,801 --> 03:06:04,634
No,

6148
03:06:05,240 --> 03:06:06,200
but I got kids.

6149
03:06:07,100 --> 03:06:09,500
I care about what the world is.

6150
03:06:10,250 --> 03:06:11,083
You know,

6151
03:06:11,120 --> 03:06:12,710
maybe if I didn't have
kids that still care

6152
03:06:14,210 --> 03:06:15,800
and I have grandchildren now,

6153
03:06:15,801 --> 03:06:16,411
I have two of them.

6154
03:06:16,411 --> 03:06:17,244
They're beautiful.

6155
03:06:17,720 --> 03:06:20,180
And you know what,

6156
03:06:21,130 --> 03:06:22,430
there's a lot of bad people out there.

6157
03:06:22,910 --> 03:06:24,650
I'm not apologize or about saying that.

6158
03:06:24,651 --> 03:06:25,970
There's a lot of great people,

6159
03:06:26,270 --> 03:06:27,380
there's more good people,

6160
03:06:28,100 --> 03:06:29,490
but it's,

6161
03:06:29,550 --> 03:06:31,100
it's like turning a battle line,

6162
03:06:32,430 --> 03:06:33,770
a line of resistance.

6163
03:06:33,771 --> 03:06:34,570
Really.

6164
03:06:34,570 --> 03:06:37,820
Where I want to call people out on it.

6165
03:06:37,850 --> 03:06:39,740
I want to remind us
that we could be better.

6166
03:06:39,920 --> 03:06:44,840
I want to remind us that
people bad selfishness,

6167
03:06:44,841 --> 03:06:45,674
worse.

6168
03:06:46,800 --> 03:06:47,120
And,

6169
03:06:47,120 --> 03:06:47,780
and I,

6170
03:06:47,780 --> 03:06:50,040
I just want to too.

6171
03:06:50,210 --> 03:06:53,570
He brought my attention to it because
I used to use that phrase so frequently

6172
03:06:53,940 --> 03:06:56,880
when I was mad and he said,

6173
03:06:56,881 --> 03:06:59,100
that's turn your med
into something better,

6174
03:06:59,880 --> 03:07:00,330
teddy.

6175
03:07:00,330 --> 03:07:03,140
That's debts because I
know what you stand for.

6176
03:07:03,141 --> 03:07:03,630
I know I,

6177
03:07:03,630 --> 03:07:06,750
that's why I give you
what I give you 22 years.

6178
03:07:07,290 --> 03:07:10,320
So people are bad,

6179
03:07:10,770 --> 03:07:11,200
but they,

6180
03:07:11,200 --> 03:07:12,033
they're good.

6181
03:07:12,510 --> 03:07:13,343
They're good.

6182
03:07:13,500 --> 03:07:16,830
That's remind people
that we need to be good,

6183
03:07:17,070 --> 03:07:18,090
that remind people,

6184
03:07:18,091 --> 03:07:19,440
that's called them on a crap.

6185
03:07:19,990 --> 03:07:21,420
That's that we can say,

6186
03:07:21,510 --> 03:07:22,343
hey,

6187
03:07:22,440 --> 03:07:23,370
we gotta be better.

6188
03:07:24,180 --> 03:07:26,130
We've got to care about the right things.

6189
03:07:26,600 --> 03:07:29,040
We've got to stop getting
caught up in our crap.

6190
03:07:29,670 --> 03:07:30,503
You know,

6191
03:07:30,690 --> 03:07:34,590
and we gotta be stronger people.

6192
03:07:34,591 --> 03:07:34,910
Bed.

6193
03:07:34,910 --> 03:07:35,790
Don't be weak,

6194
03:07:36,750 --> 03:07:37,583
you know.

6195
03:07:37,800 --> 03:07:39,180
But in other words,

6196
03:07:39,181 --> 03:07:40,120
we're using it to,

6197
03:07:40,320 --> 03:07:43,460
to remind people that
sometimes we'll go in,

6198
03:07:43,461 --> 03:07:44,430
in a bad direction.

6199
03:07:44,910 --> 03:07:45,420
We are,

6200
03:07:45,420 --> 03:07:46,171
look at the world,

6201
03:07:46,171 --> 03:07:46,650
look at that.

6202
03:07:46,650 --> 03:07:46,891
You know,

6203
03:07:46,891 --> 03:07:48,780
when I was flying here was
reading the New York Post.

6204
03:07:49,050 --> 03:07:52,110
Do you know how when people
think of week or something,

6205
03:07:52,530 --> 03:07:56,220
but I didn't want to read some of the
stories about some of these kids that got

6206
03:07:56,221 --> 03:07:56,660
killed.

6207
03:07:56,660 --> 03:07:57,000
It,

6208
03:07:57,000 --> 03:08:02,000
there was a story about a parent that
someone at a hospital in Manhattan that

6209
03:08:03,811 --> 03:08:06,450
decided to slice up a bunch of infants,

6210
03:08:06,870 --> 03:08:07,530
um,

6211
03:08:07,530 --> 03:08:09,350
just ran to the hallway of tos.

6212
03:08:09,700 --> 03:08:14,700
His place was for Chinese immigrants that
they go to this place where now young

6213
03:08:15,241 --> 03:08:20,241
mothers where they think it's a safe haven
for the children to be there for like

6214
03:08:21,600 --> 03:08:22,050
a month.

6215
03:08:22,050 --> 03:08:23,900
And so they infants two days old,

6216
03:08:23,901 --> 03:08:24,734
five days old,

6217
03:08:25,290 --> 03:08:26,123
10 days old,

6218
03:08:26,220 --> 03:08:26,911
and they're all in.

6219
03:08:26,911 --> 03:08:29,370
It was all Chinese immigrants
and they're all in there.

6220
03:08:29,880 --> 03:08:34,880
These babies and this woman walks in there
with a knife and start stabbing these

6221
03:08:35,791 --> 03:08:36,624
kids.

6222
03:08:36,930 --> 03:08:37,560
Now listen,

6223
03:08:37,560 --> 03:08:39,060
I know a lot of people
out there going to say,

6224
03:08:39,090 --> 03:08:39,361
teddy,

6225
03:08:39,361 --> 03:08:40,290
that's psychotic.

6226
03:08:40,320 --> 03:08:41,190
That's different.

6227
03:08:41,220 --> 03:08:41,670
I,

6228
03:08:41,670 --> 03:08:42,300
yes,

6229
03:08:42,300 --> 03:08:42,990
yes,

6230
03:08:42,990 --> 03:08:43,823
yes,

6231
03:08:44,820 --> 03:08:45,570
it's evil.

6232
03:08:45,570 --> 03:08:45,791
Yeah,

6233
03:08:45,791 --> 03:08:46,680
there's evil in the world.

6234
03:08:46,681 --> 03:08:47,514
Yeah,

6235
03:08:48,090 --> 03:08:49,170
but I'm just,

6236
03:08:49,230 --> 03:08:50,640
I'm just calling to arms.

6237
03:08:50,700 --> 03:08:51,630
I'm not the guy,

6238
03:08:51,930 --> 03:08:54,630
but I'm just saying in my
small way called arms that

6239
03:08:57,240 --> 03:08:58,080
we can be better.

6240
03:08:58,800 --> 03:09:00,810
That just remind people that,

6241
03:09:01,830 --> 03:09:02,663
you know what,

6242
03:09:03,240 --> 03:09:04,920
we have so much promise.

6243
03:09:06,120 --> 03:09:07,800
There's so much to be

6244
03:09:09,300 --> 03:09:10,740
grateful for in this country,

6245
03:09:11,190 --> 03:09:12,810
particularly in the world,

6246
03:09:12,811 --> 03:09:13,680
but not always.

6247
03:09:14,130 --> 03:09:16,950
And we have so much here that's be better.

6248
03:09:17,370 --> 03:09:19,290
If people bed that's help them be better,

6249
03:09:20,190 --> 03:09:21,690
that's lead the way to be better.

6250
03:09:22,360 --> 03:09:22,830
Uh,

6251
03:09:22,830 --> 03:09:23,281
that's,

6252
03:09:23,281 --> 03:09:23,940
that's,

6253
03:09:23,940 --> 03:09:25,290
that's take a stance.

6254
03:09:26,010 --> 03:09:27,210
So we're going to,

6255
03:09:27,420 --> 03:09:28,890
I don't know how the frick
we're going to do it,

6256
03:09:29,160 --> 03:09:32,220
but we're going to start this company,

6257
03:09:32,460 --> 03:09:32,941
people bear,

6258
03:09:32,941 --> 03:09:35,280
but then we're going to have
all these inspirational,

6259
03:09:35,281 --> 03:09:36,060
if you will,

6260
03:09:36,060 --> 03:09:37,560
but all these positive,

6261
03:09:37,860 --> 03:09:38,910
positive,

6262
03:09:39,060 --> 03:09:39,960
positive

6263
03:09:41,490 --> 03:09:43,140
things to say that,

6264
03:09:43,320 --> 03:09:46,860
to remind you that in a way you
could be anything you want to be.

6265
03:09:46,861 --> 03:09:47,071
You know,

6266
03:09:47,071 --> 03:09:49,440
that old saying you could
be anything you want to be,

6267
03:09:50,790 --> 03:09:52,200
but some people choose to be bad.

6268
03:09:53,190 --> 03:09:54,130
True is to be better.

6269
03:09:55,480 --> 03:09:56,380
And um,

6270
03:09:56,800 --> 03:09:57,820
so we're going to do some,

6271
03:09:57,821 --> 03:09:58,120
the,

6272
03:09:58,120 --> 03:09:59,380
some of the proceeds go to the father.

6273
03:09:59,590 --> 03:10:01,890
I don't know how the freak
were probably whatever,

6274
03:10:02,410 --> 03:10:04,930
but we're going to figure it out.

6275
03:10:05,140 --> 03:10:06,120
Um,

6276
03:10:06,550 --> 03:10:09,730
he's going to do it all
because I only know boxing.

6277
03:10:10,930 --> 03:10:11,980
I think you know more than that.

6278
03:10:12,280 --> 03:10:12,641
Listen,

6279
03:10:12,641 --> 03:10:13,200
Teddy,

6280
03:10:13,200 --> 03:10:14,260
there's been three hours.

6281
03:10:14,710 --> 03:10:15,543
I'm sorry.

6282
03:10:16,290 --> 03:10:17,081
Don't be sorry.

6283
03:10:17,081 --> 03:10:17,890
It was great.

6284
03:10:17,890 --> 03:10:19,330
I really appreciate you being here,

6285
03:10:19,331 --> 03:10:19,660
man.

6286
03:10:19,660 --> 03:10:20,200
Wow.

6287
03:10:20,200 --> 03:10:20,770
I know.

6288
03:10:20,770 --> 03:10:23,170
It's actually a little bit
more than three hours and,

6289
03:10:23,171 --> 03:10:23,920
uh,

6290
03:10:23,920 --> 03:10:24,511
thanks for,

6291
03:10:24,511 --> 03:10:25,091
it was beautiful.

6292
03:10:25,091 --> 03:10:25,924
Thanks,

6293
03:10:26,390 --> 03:10:27,070
man.

6294
03:10:27,070 --> 03:10:27,401
Thank you.

6295
03:10:27,401 --> 03:10:28,234
